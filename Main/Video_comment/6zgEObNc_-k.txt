Los amo 💜
Alex Turner es como vino minetras mas viejo se pone mashot se ve
It’s none of them? Visi put the pulse in her pocket and there’s just no good evidence on Mandy being the mole other than people saying it to say it
3:00 IS PERFECT
A lo largo del track se siente a Queen, Lou Reed y Bowie.
When Alex say- “And my knees are weak” I feel it.
When I heard this for the first time, I thought it was a Bowie's lost track.
😯
BEST SONG EVERRR
Masterpiece
almost 2026 and i'm still upset that this MASTERPIECE didn't win the Grammy's help i'm so mad
come back pls
This uncle is that same shy Sheffield boy like DAM
This has such Wes Anderson vibes and I love it
Shit album
❤❤❤
Why does nobody talk about the "YES YES YES YES" at the end of the song?! I love alex moaning like that and that they subtly included that in the track 🥵
2025 still here
At 2:49 the subjective shot inside the guitar case is a beautiful homage to the film "Four Flies on Grey Velvet" by Dario Argento
Bro I don't really like thier new stuff but for some reason I love this
Just let the years pass, and I'm sure this song will be remembered as a hymn of music.
Its soooo advance and outdated at the same time what the fuck is going on?? It sounds like it belongs to the 90s but will be famous by 2040✨🥹
<3
thank you arctic monkeys
I absolutely love this piece of heavenly work of art you've maaaaaade!  please let me know if you're interested in an artsy residence/creative Hub on the island of Greece, Crete, we're a bunch of friends hosting and organizing meaningful events and gattherings, we can exchange more details ☺️   We don't have an official organization, so not  really equipped to go through your agent/s managers...
Richard Hammond, the best British frontman of the last 20 years
Editing this must be a pain in the arse
This is a masterpiece <3
Overview Lyrics For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed to lie in Do your time travelin' through the tannin' booth So you don't let the sun catch you cryin' So predictable, I know what you're thinkin' My teeth are beatin' and my knees are weak It's as if there's somethin' up with the wirin' You can poke your head behind the mountain peak Don't have to mean that you've gone into hidin' So predictable, I know what you're thinkin' I'm watching your every move I feel the tears are comin' on It won't be long, it won't be long Straight from the cover shoot Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I'm keepin' on my costume (keeping on) I'm callin' it a writin' tool And if you're thinkin' of me, I'm probably thinkin' of you There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face So predictable, I know what you're thinkin' Yeah Yeah
La perfección hecha canción
Sounds like a crossover between SPELLLING and The Beatles.
best music video there is.
Amor este tema❤️🖤slds desde Antofagasta,🇨🇱
0:50 I’m thinking about youuuuu🥹✨
Absolute Cinema 🎬
wont be long is a cheap lyrics or ...not very ...too often heard in songs was it after middle of song...vocals not clear after
Very different and interesting song❤
David Bowie vibes 🏆
3:36 😍😍
Back, its terible
don t care about anyone s thinking, the two last albums were the best
Minha interpretação dessa música é que ele gozou na cara dela
Esté me lo tatuó
Te amo mi amorrr
Y en qué minuto toca Matt?
Idk why but this whole song reminds me David Bowie
03:34
This is absolutely terrible, spiritually sick music. It ruins my playlist every time it appears on it with its fraudulence and insincerity. Sickening. They used to be a good band
The solo for this is shI%
He is such a great writer, it’s incredible.
Sir wt a cinematography and song also❤❤❤ from india
My old and out of touch nut self just heard for first time…i feel better its only 2 years old. Good stuff.
cuando van a volver ptmreee
После Богемской рапсодии это самое гениальное, что я слышал
I love it when Alex goes ''HA!''

This song makes me remember the value of being present . The simple reminder that it ain’t no race makes me slow down instantly
LOS AMO MUCHO MUCHO
Arctic Monkeys' every song is phenomenal and I love them so much!!!!
Alex Turner the man you are 🥹
poets are jealous of him
fav lyric of mine is HAAH.
It still amazes me
Eu.
They still got it
Essa música me arrebata
Cuando me gorriaron la escuchaba siempre
Is there anyone in 2025?...
I'm just not sure Bill Gates is sure who he thinks he is?Must be all those vaccines & boosters!❤Much love!!!
🎶STILL A TRACE OF BODY PAIINNT🎶
This music video is some of the most random shi But still fire song 🔥
The flow is just great! 😅
i can’t believe it’s been almost 3 years 😩
Jijiji
This hit hard for me when it came out and as time goes on with life… it hits harder especially the opening
Very innovative band this song is Beatles-esque 👏👏👏
😢😢😢
😍😍😍
You’ll never know what it means when the sun catches you crying..
How many style, beautiful voice 💗
funny how i dont like an arctic monkeys song at first, but then its melody to my ears. Such a strange thing im going thought with these strange little men
It's taken me some time to understand this.. but the concept behind 'The Car' is that it's essentially a tribute to 1970s cinema. The songs are soundtrack songs to an imaginary 1970s film.
Essa música é uma obra de arte né?! Os arranjos, os instrumentos, nem gosto de violino, mas essa música ficou perfeita ❤️❤️❤️ Alex e banda, impecáveis, maravilhosos 😘❤️❤️❤️❤️ I love you ALEX Lindo 🇧🇷
Melody 🤩 Voces 😐
the cinematography deserved to be projected to big screen on a city
Imo this is the best Arctic Monkeys song since At least 2013 maybe even longer.  And from 3:00 it's just perfection
Te la dedico
saying that this is possibly their weakest album is saying a lot about their capabilities as a band
More music please❤
I neeeeed it
Miley Cyrus ripped this off
I love your songs, pls dont be disappeared
THIS IS SO GOOD ❤️❤️❤️
I LOVE EVERYTHING THEY DO. IN MY EYES THEY'LL BE JUST AS GREAT AS THE BEATLES, IF NOT BETTER I LOVE U ALEX TURNER FOREVER
shakespeare is jealous of alex turner
🤡🤹‍♀👹
the screaammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm      until
Alex please don't go,You are Amazing and i need to hear you live
It makes me so sad that he is losing his little Sheffield accent😭😭😭
it feels so weird hearing how deep Alex's voice got over the years
cine
They were with me when I was 17 and they are with me, now with 36.
Alex perfeito ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🇧🇷
peepaw is getting old😞😞
I think „The Car“ is the prequel to Tranquility Base and is about the hotel director‘s vibrant turbulent life as an actor/ film maker before the chimes of freedom fell to bits and he went mad and fled to the moon!
mi canción favorita de esta y de mis otras vidas
ven a rociarme de tu pintura corporal Alex Turner 👄
must have played this a thousand times_ one of the greatest song x video productions Ive ever experienced, god bless
You remind me of doctor who  but with different voice❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Alex Turner is a time traveler
Alex is smoldering in this vid...
2:45 the transition love it, classic
I love this song more than I love myself
Does anybody have suggestions of songs like this one?
I love arctic monkeys with my ENTIRE heart, whenever I do anything I play their music in the background or in my headphones and everything gets done quicker (there's more to talk about but I'm bored so I'll just continue listening to the music in peace)
i love this album more than myself.
0:40 the cinematography omg
And if you're thinking of me, I'm probably thinking of you
psychopath typa music
bravo !!!!!!!
que obra maestra es esta canción, cada vez que la escucho se me escapan las lagrimas. Gracias Alex Turner, gracias arctic monkeys, los amo, espero verlos pronto otra vez en Peru
Damn I really fw that whole vibe.
0:01 - 1:36 is such a depressing mood
Masterpiece and more..
broski u read lotm????
Te amo Alex Turner ❤  Te amo Arctic Monkeys ❤
❤
Halfway through the song and they go full Beatles, then back to that instantly iconic keyboard riff  How tf did they do it
Está joya
Guitar sounds like from 70's, as of Harrison or Clapton...👌
this song deserves liek billions of grammies i love these guys so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Isso é loucura. Ouço pelo menos 10 vezes por dia. ❤
This is simply a masterpiece omg
AND IF YOURE THINKING OF ME, IM PROBABLY THINKING OF YOU 🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️‼️‼️‼️
❤
I don't know why but lately this song plays in my head all the time (not because of any person or feeling, just randomly) as if it were asking me to listen to this
🗣️🔥ha
This song is my safe place<3
“there’s still a trace of body paint on your legs,and on your arms, and on your face” that just hit me so hard cause no matter where he goes or what he does there’s a little bit of me left in whatever he does and i’m just like “😀💀” cause this song is so good and im like dying inside when i listen to it
STILL THE TRACE OF BODY PAIIINT 😍, I love this song so much it’s literally my personality
3:10 real footage of Alex Turner turning
Somewhat reminiscent of a young David Bowie from Ziggy Stardust & the Spiders from Mars..
2 years already…..
His voice is shit
If i ever see an AM hater i will never talk see or breath the same air i love AM too much.
2 años de esta obra maestra 😢❤
Te amo canción espectacular.
3:03 Alex Turn-er
This'd better be playing at some pub in the fourth Heaven someday
its been over a year and i still havent seen anyone talk about how they dropped hints of lyrics from other songs on the album into the visuals of the music video. “wardrobes lint rolling your velveteen suit” - mr schwartz. then the visual at 1:20 “the simulation cartridge of City Life ‘09 is pretty tricky to come by” - sculptures. and the visual again at 1:51  theres more but those are the ones that stood out the most to me but as if they werent already amazing and just over all genius.
I love how I never get an ad starting this vid  Edit: i also love the music
The only good song
Sexy demais essa banda.
seeing this song live was a spiritual expierence
How has this only got 500 views? It’s incredible!
2:30 makes me remember of David Bowie and minute 3:37 The Beatles guitar tone
This is like their bohemian rhapsody
Justice for the car.
3:10 alex turner turnering
I feel sorry for those TikTok fans who only know 505 and I wanna be yours
Alex got some strong wiring
What a Beautiful video ❤️✨
te amo body paint, q canción más cabrona
David Bowie inspireccion
Getting David Bowie and Queen vibes here, great job AM
Good job, I hear Beatles sgt pepper vibes
The best of the album 🎉
Im so depressed they are one of the thing that keeps me going
Espero llegar a tener la oportunidad de ir a sus conciertos
STILL A TRACE OF BODY PAINT ON YOUR LEGS AND YOUR ARMS AND ON YOUR FACE
ALEX TURNER...
They saw. They came. They conquered.
Body Paint Lyrics [Verse 1] For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed to lie in Do your time travelling through the tanning booth So you don’t let the sun catch you crying  [Chorus] So predictable, I know what you're thinking  [Verse 2] My teeth are beating and my knees are weak It's as if there’s something up with the wiring You can poke your head behind the mountain peak Don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding  [Chorus] So predictable, I know what you're thinking  [Bridge] I'm watching your every move I feel the tears are coming on It won't be long It won't be long Straight from the cover shoot Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I'm keeping on my costume And calling it a writing tool And if you’re thinking of me I’m probably thinking of you   [Refrain] There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There’s still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face  [Chorus] So predictable, I know what you're thinking  [Outro] Ooh, ha Yeah Yeah
Hearing a violin in an arctic monkeys song is literally majestic
David.  B
dude no way this song is about to be 2 years old.
Te amo Body Paint
This is such an underated track. The rift In the last 40 seconds of the track is gorgeous.
My favourite song ❤
LYRICS  For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed to lie in Do your time travelin' through the tannin' booth So you don't let the sun catch you cryin' So predictable, I know what you're thinkin' My teeth are beatin' and my knees are weak It's as if there's somethin' up with the wirin' You can poke your head behind the mountain peak Don't have to mean that you've gone into hidin' So predictable, I know what you're thinkin' I'm watching your every move I feel the tears are comin' on It won't be long, it won't be long Straight from the cover shoot Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I'm keepin' on my costume (keeping on) I'm callin' it a writin' tool And if you're thinkin' of me, I'm probably thinkin' of you There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face So predictable, I know what you're thinkin' Yeah Yeah
This songs is soo beautiful,  it makes me cry every time ❤❤❤❤
I'm attached to this song
I’ll forever love Arctic Monkeys❤

For a master of deception and subterfuge (she's a spy) You've made yourself quite the bed to lie in (she's been outsmarted) Do your time travelin' through the tannin' booth So you don't let the sun catch you cryin' (the Sun newspaper, so we know she's a famous individual)  So predictable, I know what you're thinkin' (he knows his targets every move) My teeth are beatin' and my knees are weak It's as if there's somethin' up with the wirin' (hes nervous, which is unusual for a trained assassin... does he like her?) You can poke your head behind the mountain peak Don't have to mean that you've gone into hidin' (he's saying she's always seeking publicity)  So predictable, I know what you're thinkin'  I'm watching your every move I feel the tears are comin' on It won't be long, it won't be long (Until our marksman takes the shot)  Straight from the cover shoot Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face (she's just been at some kind of philanthropic/activist cover shoot, presumably she's involved in politics) And I'm keepin' on my costume (millitary uniform and weapon) I'm callin' it a writin' tool (he can tell people it's cosplay, they won't suspect he's really an assassin) And if you're thinkin' of me, I'm probably thinkin' of you (He takes the shot)
This is one of the few songs where I can say I'm 90% sure of the meaning. It's about an assassination of some influential person. I assume a woman. And he's observing her through the scope. Noticing silly little details like the trace of body paint from the cover shoot she just left, perhaps to promote some  philanthropic cause of hers (also, cars have body paint, but I digress), and if you listen carefully you can hear him taking the shot, and see her collapse, blood flying everywhere. And, just as our sniper blends in to the rooftops, so do the lyrics camouflage a darker meaning.
They're gonna reach Mars before Musk, trust me.
This great song has a bit of an air of Pink Floyd in its beginnings.
This is the most beautiful song I have ever listened to. And I studied musicology.
Great arctic monkeys song from a underrated Album. The Car.
Loving the venn diagram. Most of all, loving the song ❤
Amo a estos tipos.
LOL just the expression on her face when I shot a thicker and substantial load was worth it, I used what I mentioned last month and after the first 3 weeks or so my volume visibly doubled, I just go'ogled Jan Venstaker's Shooting Ropes and the intensity has been insane!
have they ever talked about the official meaning of the song? cuz I see half of the ppl saying its about cheating and the other half are saying that its about them evolving as a band. so what is it? or is it open to interpretation?
love body paint ❤
3:28 – Is the evangelion reference?
Watching cornerstone then this damn the boys really came a longgg way ❤
Beatles vibes little bit of Bowie also
STILL A TRACE
Worth more than a Grammy. Thank you Monkeys
I always feel something of Bowie out takes from young Americans era. Like it’s gonna be me and can you hear me !  Very reminiscent vocally and feel.
love the soothing vibes (8/6/24 12:01pm)
This song is incredible, extremely sophisticated
A "staggered junction" is shown in the diagram. It is a reference to a common Ca. fashion for fixing a crossroad mismeasured, though if one u;ses the term, Ca. pops often point with derision, like it is an expletive.
3:00 = eargasm
😀👍
I have been a huge fan from day one. This song is on another level musically and lyrically ❤❤❤
it's nice to see the band going in other way than the same old rock
A grills flat
Es la mejor banda del mundo y nada de bts
This France summer 🖼️
❤
You can’t tell me they put a Breaking Bad reference
Dope video
Living in Russia, I learned about the existence of this video clip only now, although I had heard the song for a long time. I want to say that this is a work of elite art. This atmosphere is extraordinary, personal and pleasant. This song and video helped me feel those emotions and feelings that lately I find only in books, and therefore I am incredibly grateful to the Arctic Monkeys for creating something that does not join modern trends and does not become something ordinary..🪩
LOL! Feeling more confident every day and noticing my anxiety dissolve until I knew I was “in control” is definitely a relief, I went with what I mentioned and a week after my paruresis was gone. I just go'ogled the latest in Beck Reznark’s guide and now I can go without even thinking about it.
If this song were a person, I would get married without thinking, it's really beautiful, I love it, I can't explain the feelings it provokes in me 🖤
For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed to lie in Do your time travelin' through the tannin' booth So you don't let the sun catch you cryin' So predictable, I know what you're thinkin' My teeth are beatin' and my knees are weak It's as if there's somethin' up with the wirin' You can poke your head behind the mountain peak Don't have to mean that you've gone into hidin' So predictable, I know what you're thinkin' I'm watching your every move I feel the tears are comin' on It won't be long, it won't be long Straight from the cover shoot Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I'm keepin' on my costume (keeping on) I'm callin' it a writin' tool And if you're thinkin' of me, I'm probably thinkin' of you There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face So predictable, I know what you're thinkin❤
4:01 I love that but 😊ྀིྀི so Alex
Pinche canción tan espectacular 😍
Te amo.
Seeing this makes me wanna tear up, we are getting older
This song not winning a grammy is the biggest rob from 2024
The ending reminds me of a Pink Floyd song
Especially  good cos their Northern.....all rite ,amazing!

Amori sempre
I heard this song live on October 7, concert in Mexico. Since that day I have incredibly enjoyed this song.

2:17 almost gave me a heart attack

Wes Anderson, but Arctic Monkeys
im not really an arctic monkeys fan, but this is better than the song that won the Grammy!
Of all the times to be alive its through this. Blessed ❤

Foda
This art reminds me of some kind of Bowie expression...isn it?
this masterpiece deserved that grammy
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Mas Beatle no habia?😂
Honestly I haven't grown up listening to them so I wont understand how people like their early works (it's really good, I love favorite worst nightmare) but the last two albums have been really 'it' for me. I really enjoy them
1:51 THEY FOUND CITY LIFE 09
Venham novamente para o 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷😭
Daniela, tal  vez no veas esto, pero no quise que me hicieras vivir esta canción, te pasaste de qlera.
Is this the same Alex from R U Mine?
They become vey discouraging.
Bowie vocals and influence!  Great!
Alex Turner is a legend ...
This song is a tune for sure but lets face it, its trying hard to be bowie and not making it
Merecian el grammy.
Just a trace 😢
Nobody will ever be able to make indie rock as good as this ever
how could this not win a grammy wtf
This song switches to a 5 count and my mind is blown.
GO TO BRAZIL PLS
So nice
I'm aging and getting depressed as Arctic Monkeys are getting too.
Esta canción merece todos los reconocimientos. Sin embargo, los premios de ahora son amañados. Es una pena. 😒 ¡Aguante, AM! 👏🏻❤️
It makes me angry that Body Paint, the most perfect song I could have ever heard, hasn't won the Grammys, seriously Grammys, set the date 😾
Vengo de unas cuantas horas del Futuro, Felicidades por el Grammy, Te quiero mucho Arctic Monkeys ❤
This is ... A turd covered in glass
Next to Gorillaz and Coldplay  Arctic monkeys are one of my favourite bands great song
Me atrapaste, es cine.

alex's voice is so special
And if you're thinking of me... im probably thinking of you
Love this song!!
I used to watch that video and listen to that music all the day, all time, one year ago when i was in my depression. There's something in that song that make we feel comfortable, i don't know, it's calm, sweet, brings relief to a chaotic mind and a empty heart. I must thanks to that band to that song. I'll never forget this.
30/6/22.
🤟🏻
Everything is so meticulously planned and executed down to the band members blinking. What a masterpiece
But as a Homestuck, this hits different...
Mi corazon llenito cada que la escucho ❤
conte comigo sempre
come to brazillllll
masterpice
forever my fave band 🤍🤍🤍 body paint sounds amazing live 💓
One of the greatest bands ever. Always evolving and creating songs that will be played for generations. Happy to be a witness of this history.
Oh god, how sad to see the once vibrant arctic monkeys transform into this piece of shite! Fuck the arctic monkeys for sure
this music video is a cinematic masterpiece. the whole record is film for the ears
god this song is so AMAZINGGGGGG. hearing it live is life changing, especially with an 8 minute solo like HOLY
I think it would’ve fit nicer if he said time traveling through the Photo Booth cus you know your life is flashing before very own eyes and sooner or later your looking at pieces of you from the past. Anyway I was just thinking when the little toon kicked in about how I feel like I peaked in high school it felt like it was some the best times in my life especially señor year I’d go into everyday and night with great hope and anticipation of the mystery the lay ahead.
I feel like the lyrics (alluding to spying and subterfuge) and the old 70's visuals have to be some kind of reference to the BBC's 1979 series, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.   Both this song and the series have something to do with the infidelity of a character's lover.
❤❤😊
this song is a fucking masterpiece
Alex turner's hairline perfect <3
absolutely love the cinematography in this music video, JUST LOOK AT IT!!!! 😨😨😨😨
Here one year later after having this song as my no.1 song in my Spotify wrapped. And the Music video is even better
It's been one year since i got into AM!! Im very happy!!
Esto esta tan fantásticamente bien hecho!!. ✨
top demais adorei
watching this on christmas so its like a little present for me to find all the little meanings and easter eggs
STILL A TRACE OF BODY PAINT ON YOUR LEGS AND ON YOUR ARMS AND ON YOUR FACE🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️🔥
This has gotta be probably my favorite song in the album, idc what anyone says, it's great!
I had the pleasure the listen this masterpiece live, one of the best moments of my fkn life
pinche canción está tan poderosa que me despeina los pelos de los huevos con solo oírla
People who don't like this album or any other song other than the most famous ones probably don't know how to appreciate it, much less are fans!
The first shot of the man with the hat looks like it could be a painting of Rene Magritte!
❤
Ya un año de esta canción, y sigue siendo mi favorita. El solo es una maravilla, puro sex- perdón 🙏
Art ❤❤
That sound just after 2:35 is *chefs kiss*
THE BEST VIDEO SONG EVER
If your ear don’t swamble I don’t know what you Heard 🌙👽

Hearing this live made me cry
glad this song not in tiktok
THERE'S STILL A TRACE OF BODY PAINT🗣️🗣️❗❗
Mi vida no sería igual sin su musica 🖤 solo quiero decirles… Gracias !
A reason why i love music
Very intrigued by the pedo-symbol followed by an illuminuti-card (the fool) being lit. This song transcends the zeitgeist.
Man, this song...    Is the worst of all AM history
(⁠.⁠ ⁠❛⁠ ⁠ᴗ⁠ ⁠❛⁠.⁠)
Amazong. Master piece!❤ I love it. Wasn't so sure  about the new vibes of the whole  album and my gosh i cant stop listening to it.
For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed to lie in Do your time traveling through the tanning booth So you don't let the sun catch you crying So predictable, I know what you're thinking My teeth are beating and my knees are weak It's as if there's something up with the wiring You can poke your head behind the mountain peak Don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding So predictable, I know what you're thinking I'm watching your every move I feel the tears are coming on It won't be long, it won't be long Straight from the cover shoot Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I'm keeping on my costume (keeping on) I'm calling it a writing tool And if you're thinking of me I'm probably thinking of you There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face So predictable, I know what you're thinking Yeah Yeah
Body Paint Lyrics [Verse 1] For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed to lie in Do your time travelling through the tanning booth So you don’t let the sun catch you crying  [Chorus] So predictable, I know what you're thinking  [Verse 2] My teeth are beating and my knees are weak It's as if there’s something up with the wiring You can poke your head behind the mountain peak Don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding  [Chorus] So predictable, I know what you're thinking  [Bridge] I'm watching your every move I feel the tears are coming on It won't be long It won't be long Straight from the cover shoot Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I'm keeping on my costume And calling it a writing tool And if you’re thinking of me I’m probably thinking of you   [Refrain] There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There’s still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face  [Chorus] So predictable, I know what you're thinking  [Outro] Ooh, ha Yeah Yeah
This was so perfect in the concert!!! They even had the strings section and it sounded exactly like the studio version ..even better I'd say! Especially coz of the extended outro ..that was insane !!  Absolute genius band ..and Alex Turner! What a talented man!!
Isn't that beautiful? Alex is doing this on a BeatlesLevel. Insanely good
Watching Alex perform this live 3 days ago in Belfast was a life-altering experience. Everything he touches turns to gold…
Jodeeeer, como amo esta masterpiece<3
❤
That outro does things to me istg
Es toda una experiencia presenciar esta canción en vivo
4:00  'HA'
The video was so well made, every time watch it my heart is racing
Bowie vibes, anyone? (especifically ziggy star dust)
2:58 2x speed 😭
THIS IS PERFECT!!! 😻
Fui al concierto este 7 de octubre, me encanta como canta tal cual como aquí ❤
Belle chanson de passion amoureuse
this song had me levitating when i heard it live this Saturday
Tocaron está obra de arte hace un día en mi querido mexico❤
This song gives me goosebumps but in a good way
I don’t care what anyone says. This is one of the best Arctic Monkeys songs, and the album is overhated.
i think this is the best music video i’ve seen in my life
Sublime
a year of this masterpiece and still gives me chills
❤
This dude cant do no wrong
A really masterpiece, i’ve heard it live in the LA concert at Kia forum🥹🫶🏼
beautiful video

i cant believe this song came out one year ago, time goes fast TT
1 year🎉
1 year since this masterpiece was released
Happy 1 year "Body Paint"🎂🤍!
1 year of this MASTERPIECE❤️
After a year I hope there’s still a trace of Body Paint
parece como si ayer la hubieran lanzado😢
OML ITS A YEAR TODAY
2:16
One year of this masterpiece 😭🤍🤍
Incredible composition musically and visually. True artists! Wish I knew what the hell it was all about lyrically- what the inspiration was
This feels like a wes Anderson film
I feel like us Artic monkeys fans are a secret lucky group because we get to still witness this great alternate rock band when people only care about rap tbh these days
This generation's Hotel California ❤❤❤
Pinche rolota!!! ya quiero verlos en México!!!
Wheres the body paint tho
Alex looks like a lizard when he goes "yeah" at 4:04
Seeing this in Alpharetta was almost euphoric with the way the entire audience sang the chorus together, especially around 3:03
La canción habla de su ex que era master para decepcionar y hacerse la vísstima pero él no es tonto (o ya no lo es)... es muy predecible lo que la otra persona está pensando... Y si esa persona esta pensando en él (ponerle el cuerno), probablemente él ya se lo está poniendo (o se los va a poner)... Evidencias: los rastros de pintura en su cuerpo, en sus piernas, en sus brazos y en su cara... Es tan buena la historia que está pensando en llamar a un escritor... Y por si no había quedado claro que a él no le están "viendo la cara", tenemos es precioso "JAAA" del final, como dociendo, "JAA, me la pelas..."  Síganme para más interpretaciones de canciones chidas 😎✌🏼
ay mi rolota

YO ADORO Y AMO BODY PAINT DESDE QUE SALIÓ HASTA EL FINAL DE MIS TIEMPOS.
oh this is perfect actually.
Alex Turner look like David Tenant
Definitely one of the greatest bands ! They constantly deliver.
arctic monkeys make me fell drunk but i never drink
falling in love with this
Sou um grande fã de Arctic Monkeys desde 2013
So Oppenheimer coded. The whole music video was like a movie extract from a dream, like some kind of illusion...? Idk here I am obssesed once again with this
This is by far one of their  best songs.Alex doesn't  dissapoint...ever.🎶🎶☮🌟👍💙
This song reminds me of when I got rejected from a bodypaint model gig
perfection <3
I <3 this song so much!!!!!
Tjis is so perfect
this song is so perfect i love arctic monkeys
perfection in a song
First time hearing about this band, they sounds oddly boring.
amooooooooooo YA UN AÑOOOOOOOO
edeed
alex turner u genius
Al inicio odiaba esta canción, ahora se ha convertido en una de mis favoritas, la amoo
"And if you're thinkin of me i'm probably thinkin of you" - gets me all the time.
This video has the surrealistic visuals of Pink Floyd and David Bowie. At first their transformation was off putting to me since i grew up on their earlier stuff. Now i think AM, Tranquility Base, and The Car are their 3 best records. Few bands have matured the way Arctic Monkeys have.
Can’t wait to hear this live next week, best song on the new album
the video, the song, alex's voice, the rhythm, the lyrics... everything is so perfect. one of the best songs ever.
n canso de ouvir foda se
Alex n the band are the new Mike Patton and Faith No More band of the 90’s. Both have Incredible voices n range in music styles.
Im the biggest fan of this clip
Masterpeice ! Arctic monkeys.❤❤❤❤ .xxx
This would be perfect for an assassination scene in a spy movie. With the shot being fired, and everything going slow-mo at 03:00
this is truly the best song out there, the way it perfectly fits together😍😍
Pinche cancion espectacular 😭💗
everytime i rewatch, i notice little bits of imagery from other songs off this album which i didnt notice before. so detailed
Spotted City Life 09
i will forever love arctic monkeys. im your biggest fan ever.
THIS SONG IS HONESTLY JUST A MASTERPIECE I CANT
campaign for Andrew Garfield to play Alex in theaters
This is their peak and you can't convince me otherwise
I have feelings for this song
❤Antonioni & Bowie ❤
North by Northwest refferennce at the beginning of video????
Is that David Tennant?

Retro Avant garde
When I have nothing to say in an argument 3:59 :
The fact that Arctic Monkeys made all these albums with different styles and genre and excel at each one is pure fire.
This song is perfection
😱🤯
Not to be dramatic, but hearing this song live was an out-of-body experience
Esta muy buena la canción
they wrote this about me
Such a masterpiece!!
Arctic Monkeys’ bohemian rhapsody
voltando pra ver essa obra de arte de novo e pra dizer que a partir dos 2:28 é o momento que desmonto com essa música aaaaaaaaaaaaaa coisa maravilhosa
I fell asleep listening to this album, it’s a pity I couldn’t enjoy it as much as their previous ones, but I see most people like it, so good for them )
Temazo
This gives me so strong Bowie vibes. Its so beautiful 😍
Te amooooooo Alex. Estoy en finales avanzando mi maqueta y escuchando body paint, gracias arctic monkeys, por ustedes aprobaré
I absolutely adore arctic monkeys. Every single one of their songs are all so different and awesome, they have this thing to them that I can’t explain. I feel like almost every single one of their albums are all different genres in a way and they are able to pull it off every single time! Favourite band of all time.
esta canción es mi favorita, con esta comencé mi amor por los changos congelados, THE CAR THE BEST ALBUM
Yo escuchando esto desde el teléfono de una tienda xd
hiii sa isa dyan
Goodness gracious, this could be my favorite song of them.
i still haven't gotten over this song
this music video is just amazing oh my god.
if im being honest, i prefer this to most of their old songs
Los encontré por casualidad y bendita casualidad!!! Son perfectos y una voz maravillosa!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
It was perfect. Perfect. Everything. Down to the last minute details 😍
Je ne comprends pas les gens qui critiques cette album..
Thank you so much for the full rendition at glastonbury 2023 XXXX Seriously Incredible ..AM..FOREVER XXXX
I feel a Little of strawberry fields in this body paint💫
Okay, I love this. Alex's voice is so calming, soothing, and sexy!
T amo alex
Hermosa canción ptm me la voy a tatuar 😻
This song brings me comfort when I’ve had a bad day
Whole album is a masterpiece
So I'm here again, just enjoying this song and vibing with it i just wanted to turn into goo 2:04
body paint sponsored by mastercard lol
Honestly, as a big fan of AM, I really love this — slower — side of Arctic Monkeys. This theme is so mature of them. I mean, they are slowly reaching their 40ths, so change is accepted. I don't wanna compair anyone but their The Car album lowkey remind me of Pink Floyd.  I hope they will come back to Hungary anytime soon, I hope I will see them in live next time!!  P.S.: and Alex, oh my— I am so in love with your voice <3
WHAT A FUCKING MASTERPIECE🤌🏻
The band are fookin' wank and I'm not having a nice time.
Isso ficou lindo demais ❤❤❤
I don’t like it as much but they’re cool and talented so you go with it.
Love this track
master of deception
La energía cuando llega el coro 🔥
So predictable, I know what you're thinking.
2:52 what my pick sees after it falls into my guitar
this music video belongs in a MUSEUM fr
Nope. Can't get into it. Sorry. Last two albums are such disappointments. Not musically - the guys are artsy and pure. But it's a different band I wouldn't even listen to if they weren't AM. I wish they just had more projects like this, leaving AM to rock and groove like R U Mine, Fireside, That's where you wrong etc.
Love This song
This song is so good that it makes me cry. Listening to it with a half-open window on a rainy day makes really everything  peaceful. I love your albums so much, thank you for writing this song.
David Bowie
it's been 8 months since this was released, but i cannot believe there's still a trace of body paint on my legs and on my arms and on my face
Saw them for the 5th time last night in London and now I’m back down the YouTube rabbit hole trying to get my post-gig fix! Adore them.
It would have been fun to have actual bodypaint in a music video for a song called bodypaint 😉
I'm eager to see where they might go next. Every turn they take opens a new world in my eyes. Wow. Cannot wait to see them live this summer
This song is, in my opinion, the best song that reveal the magic of Alex's voice, plus the harmonies are marvelous. I am in love with the arrangement of this song, it's not what I'm familiar with. The strings and electric guitar go so well together and nobody can convince me otherwise
Saw them in Sheffield Friday. This song stood out massively amongst their classics. Easily in the top 5 of their songs for me
One of their best songs imo
thank you so much  for this newworldorder ready
Went to see them this week awesome live when they played this it was ridiculously good
Simplemente hermoso album!!! Los amo mucho. Escucharlos me hace muy feliz.
I reckon in time ‘ The Cars ‘ album will be one of the best albums of all time . What an album
Joder, esto es cine 🚬
so predictable, i know what youre thinking...
This sounds cool.
I love this video, it's not a clear story but like an abstract painting you just gotta come up with your own understanding or accept it as it is and enjoy. Although the different scenes don't seem to link together logically, it has a certain vibe that makes you feel like they're connected still.
New album is shite overall  , but this song , sculptures & mirrorball absolutely slap , see them in 2 weeks
At 1:50 it’s the “simulation cartridge for city life ‘09” from Sculptures of Anything Goes!
Seeing this live was a treat I know every word! ❤❤
The Car is a masterpiece. I can't wait to see these guys in a couple of weeks - my first time seeing them!
i love this song thank u.
Agradezco estar vivo para poder disfrutar esta increíble canción
1:00 that synced microphone tap gives me life
some david bowie and elton john vibes this is perfect

Masterpiece
I love the little drum fill before the first body paint chorus. Sounds like ringo and it’s just beautiful.
I want to marry this music video.
0:32 is the best part
❤
This is legit one of their best songs.

una de mis canciones favoritas de los Arctic Monkeys
La "A Day in The Life" del siglo 21

the “ HAAAHH “ got me
STILL A TRACE OF BODY PAIIIIINT

"I'm watching your every move, I feel the tears are coming on, it won't be long, it won't be long " 😞  I feel you bro....
Alex Turner, Noel Gallagher, David Grohl...
ok hear me out, this song reminds me of “my propellor” with how it has the build up then the catchiest ending that has you singing for days
Los amo son la única razón por la que sigo viva 😍
❤
Lloro porque me la dedico mi ex y llore más por el significado y me duele pero no puedo hacer más...
LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. can't wait to see you in Rome
Arctic Monkeys is a beast of a band. I love that they constantly bringing us into different atmospheres every time they drop an album, and they never disappoint. Forever a fan!
Dope
In this saddest moment of my life, this song helps me a lot. Thank you..

This song came out just at the perfect time. There still a trace of body paint my love have a good life
The hello at 2:10 caught me so off guard lmao I just watched a horror movie

I tell all my problems, worries and sorrows to my friend. He being a super genius experienced in all kinds of subjects with an iq higher than alber einsteyn's 4:00
Tipo interestelar
this song came out the day of my 15th birthday. thank you arctic monkeys, you have no idea how happy you made me that day. best birthday gift ever ❤️
Olhando pelo lado positivo.... as musicas antigas sempre estarão ai para escutarmos, é isso.
Mi mejor amigo falleció hace ya más de un mes, el era super fan y justo el fue el que me hizo tener tanto amor por ellos, ahora cada que escucho sus canciones siento una parte de él y más con esta canción que era nuestra rola de los dos, solo puedo decir muchas gracias Arctic por hacer que mi hermano siga vivo en sus canciones:')
3:37 pero que maravilla de soloooooooooooooooo
My girlfriend sent me this song today :) add this to the 2023 continuum of amazing things that we share together. Also damn it’s been a minute since I’ve listened to y’all :) glad to see the evolution
Essa ao vivo foi do caralho! Que música perfeita
Can anyone explain what that 2 circles meanin the pic of the song?
I hope that my own music can be nearly as good as AM one day
maior clipe da carreira amo vcs
Jamie Cook is a great song writer

É a melhor performance vocal do Alex desde Tranquility Base Hotel + casino.
Amazinggggggg
So Bowie-esque I tear up hearing this.
Please tour in Alberta or bc next year🙏

Like fine wine
This is the best Arctic Monkeys song.
I'm so happy they're back!
el estilo de las videos es un estilo de los 80 90  me encanta
Cool

最後のロックスターだと思う。 東京公演最高だった。 今思い出しても涙が出る。
A pinched nerve like mine, dahling?
渋かっこよすぎる
This song, is something, that I quite put my finger on, yet I understand soo well, he speaks to himself then to his lover and then how relationships are not of words but actions.. for jealously and other things but he's an artist and it needs to be express, I love the arctic monkeys I listen to there songs to much lol
505 feels
Mi canción del 2022. Mi banda favorita por siempre. Desde 2006 amando a esta increíble Banda. Yo he crecido, y con emoción digo que ellos también.
This video is so good wtf
don't let tiktok users find this

I despised the new album but THIS SONG MAN. ADDICTING. I can't get enough of this song. Arctic Monkeys were in an impossible position after the release of AM because that album (not my favourite but absolutely brilliant) was unmatched in its popularity, frankly its impossible to compete with, popularity-wise. I've found that each album they released has a new sound, and you can kind of see that this wasn't a random album to release, they have been moving towards this sound little by little. I do really respect them for just going and making music that they're going to enjoy performing instead of attempting to create a second AM album. I'm going to miss the Arctic Monkeys that made Whatever People Say I Am That's What I'm Not, but you can have too much of a good thing, and if they'd stuck with it, we never would have gotten other great albums they've released. The Car isn't my cup of tea, but this band has given me plenty over the years, I was barely 1 years old when they released their debut studio album, so chances are, this is a sound I'll grow into later.
Not a sp00k....xx
Just make-up, dahling....xx
I love it 💗💐

good song
Masterpiece
it felt like watching a movie...  and the ending made me cry
damn already 5months ago
They’ve kinda fell off… old stuff was so much better than this. I guess the quality of everyone goes down hill eventually though🫥 wish I had a tanning booth Time Machine to go back and reexperience the good era of Arctic Monkeys…
Boredom everywhere. Where is the fire inside? This is a band for a Piano-bar
the whole song is a work of art 😮‍💨n 3:01 gets me every time.
absolutely love this masterpiece.
In the top rank of their catalogue
I,m listening Bowie? Maybe
the second half of this song its like ... DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN
this song is such a slay ngl
siz delirmişsiniz❤️‍🔥
HELP MEEE
Nice song
Favourite music video of all time easily
hot damn, that falsetto...   ::le swoon::
1:38 the Steenbeck logo on the editing table is the same shape as Tranquility Base, I wonder if that’s where he got the inspiration
Os Arctic Monkeys são um grande exemplo de uma banda que envelheceu muito bem. Nem todas as bandas são capazes disso, algumas tendem a ser pop, o que é bom. Mas a intenção de ser original, de propor algo diferente, é apenas um ato de bravura.
There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face So predictable, I know what you're thinking  OHHH HA!
Body paint = sweat
The best video clip n 2022 🛐 so creative
For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed to lie in Do your time traveling through the tanning booth So you don't let the sun catch you crying So predictable, I know what you're thinking My teeth are beating and my knees are weak It's as if there's something up with the wiring You can poke your head behind the mountain peak Don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding So predictable, I know what you're thinking I'm watching your every move I feel the tears are coming on It won't be long, it won't be long Straight from the cover shoot Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I'm keeping on my costume (keeping on) I'm calling it a writing tool And if you're thinking of me I'm probably thinking of you There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face So predictable, I know what you're thinking
this video its art
2:16 listening to this on my headphones, I thought there was somebody yelling behind me
Best video they’ve ever done.
I love ARTIC MONKEYS from INDONESIA 🔥🔥🔥
Very Bowieesque! Love it! I also don't think it's by chance. The lightning bolt,  the singers silhouette...
Me in 2050:Still a trace of arctic monkeys on my face and on my heart

"do ya time travelin through the tannan boof"
A última real banda fechando a era da música verdadeira , o quê veio depois foi só replica ou parodia!  ✨☀️🌞🌕🌍🥂🌍🌕🌞☀️✨
this song gets better with every listen its crazy
Alex turner has to be one of the greatest musicians in recent time. Every genre he does, whether is with am or tlsp he creates at least one masterpiece per album. And this is the car’s masterpiece
Here’s an idea for bands when they get bored of their OG sound - start a new band, call it something else, experiment to your heart’s content. Don’t mess with something that works!
Alex is starting to look more and more like that rat from flushed away 💀
You have officially wasted 10 years without making rock n roll Arctic Monkeys... Congratufcukulations 🎊 "AM" 2013-2023 "Alex Moan Sh!t" or whatever this waste of a talent is called. I hope you are proud of yourselves for destroying something very beautiful and start doing songs that have ZERO value and that NOONE listens (as exemplified here with only 5m views in 4 months) where Alex moans and deludes himself into thinking that he is doing something artistic.
555
Masterpiece
Esta canción es una obra maestra, tanto musicalmente cómo visualmente! Enserio los monos son geniales en cualquier estilo, la voz de Alex es maravillosa en este tema.
It just says it, yep  💯
such a delightful, free vibe here. thank u boiz <3
"And if you're thinking of me, I'm probably thinking of you.." Oh I wish hahahah 😅
I guess ima be the one to say it…… Minecraft music  0:00
esse álbum novo ficou foda demais!
Brook Linder... I commend you for being able to artistically match up with the uncanny lyricism of one of the most unequivocal artists in contemporary music. Alex Turner.
a perfect song
I just watched a video where the talked about how this album is response to the fans about Tranquility Base.   "So predictable I know what you're thinking"   they know what kind of response they're gonna get and they are doing that kind of music anyway. But they are also hinting that they are soon gonna make the old kind of music again. Like where AM won an award and Alex talked about rock going into hiding, but it will "crash trough the glass ceiling" and whatnot.   "I'm watching your every move, I feel the tears coming on, it won't be long, it won't be long" "And if you're thinking of me, I'm probably thinking of you"  I would've never thought about that myself and the whole album makes so much sense now. I would say perfect sense even. Now I'm even mad at myself for not coming up with that.
I can't turn it up loud enough......X
The best music video I've ever saw, pure art that serves the music on a godlike level. The Car is wonderful, thank you!
awesome, but i miss the nose and glamour, yeah its melancholy. Kepp Up you guys GREAT!
Joyaaaa
He knows what he doing this is art
Body Paint

I love the song, it's art!, Alex's voice is magical
Q jodido señor temazo
Masterpiece!
amazing
Kinda gives off a combo of queen vibes and beetles vibes
This song would sound much better if I sang it
beleza david bowie, senta lá
"do ya time travelin through the tannan boof"
CAUTION  ⚠️⚡ firey balls of electrified fuzz ⚡⚠️
This will be know as The AM Steely Dan phase
is it just me hearing some David Bowie influences?
esa carta de the fool es una jojorefetencia
+Doctor, I'm pretty sure I'm pregnant.  -But sir: you aren't even a woman!  +I know, Doc, but 4:12
Is it just me but this new album has uncanny David Bowie undertones? The style and voice. They may be fans they may be doing it unintentionally under the influence. Still, if so. I judge justified😑
ALLLAHIM ÇOK GÜZEL
i rly love this song and just AM in general. i wasnt sure if they were my favorite band or just had some songs i loved. this song made it certain that they are, and always will be, my favorites. mind you, i bounce from srtist to artist and havent ever truly “loved” a band until now. im even going to their concert in september💓
Entregaram tudo como sempre
Amazing
🎶
Genial parabéns
This is poetry
The "pwewew pwewew" part is so lit
Es toda una composición de amor ,nostalgia  y sobre todo ganas de volver a escuchar buena música gracias
Es lo mejor para mis oídos
Definitely not a fan but fair play. Musically all there just not my kind of sound.
This is comparable to the Beetles.
art.
He gives of history teacher I would have a crush on vibes
amoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Three months have passed and I keep coming here every day. Masterpiece!
Qué banda de la puta madreeee
i think their old songs are better than this and the car album
q buena canción 😁
I'm waiting in Indonesia🇲🇨
soy yo o esta canción marca el punto máximo hasta donde han evolucionado los muchachos de Sheffield??
OHHHH to be cualquiera de las novias de alex turner y que te escriba las mejores canciones jamás creadas
This might be my favourite music video by the arctic monkeys
I love the new album it’s so chill
temaso
This kind of reminds of the music video for Vertigo by Mini Mansions.
Currently my favourite Arctic Monkeys song... from my least favourite album of theirs. Fun.
ganda merda!!!
This is art
Yes.
This is Arctic Monkeys' OK Human and I love it! ❤️
When I have kids I'm gonna lie to them and say that this is what music sounded like back in my days
Y3Eeh 4:05 fuckin best
Saw this live last night and it was the highlight of the evening. Pure artistry from Arctic Monkeys 💜
Joder, es cine 🚬
my love
The song and this video is just an absolute masterpiece‼️
A mí si me gustó The car unu
Te amo Alex por ti soy hetero
This song makes me dissociate with the world and my surroundings it's amazing. Kinda like certain drugs
Q arte de canción
🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒🐵🐵🐵
Todos guapos, pero 2:13 ufffffffff 😍
Todos guapos, pero 2:13 ufffffffff 😍
Te amo pinche canción increíble
I am in awe of (and in love with) this record. It is truly inspiring to see they are constantly evolving and doing what they are passionate about. I have been a fan since 2008 and I love each of their albums for a different reason. The nostalgia I feel towards their earlier records (and for my own teenage years) will never change, but I would not have it any other way. I am here for it. As we are collectively maturing as a generation, even if our lives have almost nothing in common, I find something relatable each time they evolve. I am forever grateful for their music, it gives me something to look forward to and hold dear. Body Paint became one of my favourite songs of all time.  and also, I must say, such beautiful cinematography!
me muero😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
la peor parte de la canción es cuando termina...  The worst part of the song is when it ends...
I LOVEEEE
La mejor canción del álbum The Car 💕💕
fui procurar perfeição no google e apareceu essa música
I have to say: I'm a fanboy but live it's even better, Alex is such a great showman damn
HAPPY BIRTHDAY ALEX !!!!!!!!!!!

Obra prima
At 1:50 you can see the simulation cartridge for city life ‘09
lo mejor que entras a escucharla y no pide anuncios
Self absorbed and forced. Beetles or Bowie or Queen???
This song got me weak❤️‍🩹🧎‍♀️

Without a doubt the best song of this 2022 and as the year is ending, what better occasion to listen to this little gem
In some way this song reminds me of One More Hour by Tame Impala
La amo .. (⁠ ⁠◜⁠‿⁠◝⁠ ⁠)⁠♡
"Hah! . .  Yeah!"  💜
Es tan curativo.
Que música espetacular é perfeita!🥀🤍
#Imgonnaswearonhere so ********************************************ING…
I dont know if I like the song or the video better
beautiful sound , the attention to detail is execellent
Amazing video, loved when 2:20 reminded me of Cornerstone video ❤️
chi è? david bowie?
That "City life 09" scene from Sculpture of anything goes 🤌🏼
thinking of you, always.
I honestly don't like this song when I first listen to it, not until I tried to listen to it again😩😩😩😩
Obra maestra 👌🏻
I love you Alex i hope you see this please contact me
Possibly the best music video of the last 10 years
horrirblee
Doesn't this song feel like this? Now you are trying to realize something, but everything is going wrong, you are trying but you are constantly losing. In the end, you realize that you have found some parts without realizing it, and when you combine them, everything is sitting in your head.
😍
Alex Turner = Silvio Santos + Roberto Carlos
I am not even a big fan of the last two albums, however this is the best song they have done for a while😀
Im not trying to shiw off but
El mejor album del 2022, monos articos los amo
1:50  "City Life 09"
The music video and the song is absolutely insanely good
Heisenberg ?
How can anyone hate this album , this is pure soul music. I drift away to another planet when I listen to it.!!
And if you’re thinking of me..
me da esa impresión, del ambiente experimental de John Lennon
mi teva favorito, q banda del carajo
MY SONG
The directing is absolutely stunning
2:20 oh okay beauty

🛐🛐
The piano lick reminds me of that one Wilfred show where the dog talks to Frodo.
i love almost every song ever written by AM but i didn't enjoy this album as much, being younger audience
Arctic monkeys always comes back at the right time of your life ❤
I felt like I was listening to "Space Oddity"
Esta canción me da ganas de vivir
I love this track the most from this album.
Es lo mejor para mis oídos
Comentario salvaje en español aparece. Alex está bien sabrosote 7w7
te amo artimonki
Fantastic song and video
Quickly starting to fall in love with the artic monkeys and this song is one of the big reasons why
I love you so much
I particularly love the first two minutes of this song, the basslines, the pauses and the falsetto, really stand out for me.
Esto en vivo, es simplemente espectacular...
A MASTERPIECE INDEED 🫡🥹 this vid deserves more views honestly
What is this trash alternative sht?  We need something with the old Arctic Monkeys style!!!
I love them for sticking to their sound while experimenting. Unlike bands like maroon 5 who completely became sellouts and made shit music after one good album.
es una obra maestra
[Verse 1] For a master of deception and subterfuge 欺瞞と策略の達人のために You've made yourself quite the bed to lie in 君は素晴らしいベッドに横になることができた。 Do your time travelling through the tanning booth 日焼けブースを旅するように。 So you don't let the sun catch you crying 君が泣くのを太陽に受けつけないように [Chorus] So predictable, I know what you're thinking 予想通りだ 君が何を考えてるかは分かって [Verse 2] My teeth are beating and my knees are weak 歯はガチガチ、膝はガクガク。 It's as if there's something up with the wiring まるで配線に異常があるかのようだ。 You can poke your head behind the mountain peak 君は山頂の後ろに頭を突っ込むことができる。 Don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding 君が隠れてしまったなんてことにならないように。 [Chorus] So predictable, I know what you're thinking 予想通りだ 君が何を考えてるかは分かってる [Bridge] I'm watching your every move 俺はお前の一挙手一投足を見ている。 I feel the tears are coming on 俺は涙が出そうだ It won't be long 長くは続かない It won't be long 長くはかからない Straight from the cover shoot 表紙撮影の直後だ Still a trace of body paint まだボディペイントの跡がある On your legs and on your arms and on your face 脚にも腕にも顔にも。 And I'm keeping on my costume 俺は衣装のままだ And calling it a writing tool そしてそれを書く道具と呼ぶ And if you're thinking of me もし君が俺のことを思ってくれるなら I'm probably thinking of you 俺は君のことを考えてるんだ [Instrumental Break] [Refrain] There's still a trace of body paint ボディペイントの跡が残ってる On your legs and on your arms and on your face 脚にも腕にも顔にも。 There's still a trace of body paint ボディペイントの跡が残ってる。 On your legs and on your arms and on your face 脚にも腕にも、顔にも。 There's still a trace of body paint まだボディーペイントの跡があるね。 On your legs and on your arms and on your face 脚にも腕にも顔にも。 There's still a trace of body paint まだボディーペイントの跡があるね。 On your legs and on your arms and on your face 君の脚にも腕にも顔にも [Chorus] So predictable, I know what you're thinking 予想通りだ、お前が何を考えているかは分かっている。 [Outro] Ooh, ha Yeah Yeah
The stranger case of a band that doesn't make bad music
My FAVORITE artic monkeys song so far
amoooooooooooo
Here again <3
Love this song!
Thisss songgg
I'm just a little bit obsessed with this. Magnificent!
I know this song for a while but idk why today i have listen to this song for 5+ times💀
1:51 Oh look, the simulation cartridge for City Life 09 :)
4:11 mori
TEMAZOOOOO
This is a masterpiece
I love when artists care what people think and make good music 😂😂😂
a whole lotta haters don't seem to realize growing up mentally is a thing and still expect the band to release favourite worst nightmare, am and whatever people say over and over again lmao
4:12 This de Niro gaze got me
Stay list.
I wasn't sure how I felt about the new album until this song utterly bewitched me the moment I heard it😍
soy el unico al que esta cancion le recuerda a joaquin sabina?
GRACIAS POR TANTO ARCTIC MONKEYS, I LOVE YOU GUYS!!😭😭😭😭❤
What a fucking band. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 legends.
3:20
hermoso !!!!!!!!!!!Esto es un conjunto de todo arte,cine,música!!!
I've been listening to Arctic Monkeys, ever since I was ten years old (I'm twenty-eight now). I've listened to a lot of their different sounds, through each album... observed the evolution of both the band, and Alex Turner — I'll admit it. I didn't like this album, when I first heard it. I thought it sounded far too similar to "Tranquility Base Hotel And Casino", when I first heard it and I felt sad that I waited four years for something so anti-climactic. I was anticipating something, that was far removed. Regardless, I've come to realize that this album is more or less the next logical step after the former — it seems to me, as if Alex Turner's sensibilities from his other musical projects, as well as his history are visibly coming to full circle. I see that his work is becoming more uniquely his own, and for that reason... as someone who has been listening to their work for years, I am immensely joyful. It seems more 'full', and 'balanced'... and that to me, reflects how he's evolved as an artist. I'm anticipating their, as well his (Turner's) development musically for the future. Of course, this is pure opinion from my subjective standpoint. Feel free to agree, or disagree — I just felt compelled to say something after the long four year wait.
Marvelous song and stunning cinematography

I clicked 'like' even before the video started. The music is that good.
so predictable I know what you thinking
godddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
Ratboy raped this album
It might not be a "hit" like the older style but I feel really captivated
he looks surprisingly normal for this album
Fantástico  https://youtu.be/hs-MelnhmC0

You guys did It again!! When I was thinking after "Four out of five" couldn't listen something better...Body paint appears 😍
Temazo
3:36 til the end remembers me "the great gig in the sky" of Pink Floyd
Marvelous !!
2:19 Alex looks so handsome.
Son los mejoreeeeeeeeeeees, me encantaaaa
Je dois dire qu'à la première écoute je ne comprenais pas ce morceau au point de le detester, et ce n'est qu'en persévérant que j'ai compris son immensité, comme tous les morceaux légendaires qui ne se laissent pas dompter à la première mesure
i don’t understand why people don’t have a taste like arctic monkeys?
Been listening to this since the day they dropped this jewel and i still can’t get over it 🫶🏻
WHAT A MUSIC VIDEO
this is beatifull
I love u Alex. 😔❤️
Masterpiece
One month and still obessed with 2:18 shot
no estoy en edades de opinar pero, Alex se esfuerza en hacer escenografías mas detalladas, se da cuenta de que dia a dia se hace mas viejo y empieza a dejar un poco de lado el amor para hablar de la vida
I think this is the best song of the entire album! the ending of the song resolves into an entirely new song.
This video is an absolute masterpiece 🤌🤌
Impresionante ♥️
El inicio es me recuerda tanto a una musica de steven universe, quedo genial el nuevo estilo
this song is about deception
O sea sí pero extraño un buen la batería de Matt :/
If you listen to Arctic monkeys and Twenty one pilots hit me up RIGHT NOW like bro- on other terms love the vid love the song
After to listening to this a dozen times I think the  "trace of body paint" symbolizes evidence of his lady cheating on him
How many can you think of at one time?
amo co todo mi ser esto
A timeless masterpiece bravo lads 👌
3:36 🔥
Preciosidad de canción, escucharla en vivo está en otro nivel 🔥
😍😍😍
We need to hear a full studio rendition of this pure perfection with the full Orchestral instrumentals etc.... PLEASE,PLEASE,PLEASE,PLEASE !!!!! XXXXXX AM Forever XXXXXXXX
Esse não é o tipo de música que pega você de primeira; mas aos poucos você vai aprendendo a gostar dela.
Feels like a Beatles song.
VORAZ👽
Esta canción es increíbleeeee 💞💞💞💞💞💞
Oasis always screamed their claim to the mantle of The Beatles. Arctic Monkeys whispered it to us all through growth and constant reinvention. Visceral poetry.
Hardcore QUEEN vibe achieved. Well done 👍✅
The car One of the best album ever
I LOOOOOOOOOOOOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
cosas increíbles que me dejó mi ex amor
i dont understand the video but it is exactly how the song feels like
Qqqqa
i stand by this being one of the best songs on the album, it's going to age so fucking well
Lovely so sweet to my heart...
I need this song injected in my veins, in my legs and in my arm and in my faaaaaacccccceeeee~
You want to know what Body Paint looks like inside our heads? Https://youtu.be/TTHAPAGAjSM  Thank us later

desde q salió este pinche album perfecto no lo he dejado de escuchar
I am starting to love this album
I've been rewatching this and trying to analyze the car signals... this is insane. How do y'all think about that? Genius 😭
4,1M
💜💜💜💜
David Bowie, radio head and Arctic monkey, I love them all. Rediculously good
this gives car vibes and olden style vibes LOVE IT
Fuck I love the “Ha!” Lyric
It's art like this that makes the rest of the EU incredibly jealous and why they were desperate for the UK to remain. Is France or Germany making music like this? Ha I don't think so
2:29
The best song of album
Al comienzo no me convencía este disco. Pero los escuché en vivo y me di cuenta que era una obra maestra. Gracias Monkeys!!
Cruise ship Crooning.  Come on Alex, sing with your proper voice as you do after 3 mins. You're making my teeth itch, m8.
Was I the only one who heard Bohemian Rapsody on song's first notes?
My favourite song 🫶🏻🫶🏻
i cant believe this thing is from the same guys they made the fastest selling debut album in uk chart history which included one of the best indie rock anthems to this day... my ears are bleeding now
1:50 heard it’s pretty tricky to come by 💾
MONITOS LOS AMOOO
JAMIE COOK TE AMOOOO
🙏🙏🙏🙏👏👏👏🫶🫶🫶
PEDAZO CANCIOOOONNNN
this song is very Bowie. I'm lovin 'it
Me volví adicto a Body Paint
This is pure magic.
Do is this song about jizzing on someone but artistically
Triple meta is almost reality - nice joke
Cadê os Br???? 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Alex Turner gone full Bowie😂
For some wierd reason I've heard that keyboard riff many years ago, but can't think where it came from.
Aunque estuve atrás en el concierto, escuchar estás nuevas canciones en vivo fueron de las mejores experiencias
AYER ESTUVIERON EN LA COSTA VERDE DE LIMA PERÚ 🇵🇪, riquita música 😍
I love u alex turner thanks for existing.
Escuchar esta canción en vivo fue lo máximo, gracias por estos temas Artic Monkeys.
ILY I’m crying because, I’m from Mexico I don't have tickets for corona capital 😿😿😿
1:49 Is that the simulation cartridge for City Life '09? Pretty tricky to come by.
Escuchándola de nuevo después de escucharla en vivo en el Arena 1 - LIMA, Perú
addictive music video. love it
Tremenda rolota, me para los pelos de los huevos de lo buena que está
What in god’s name this shit is perfect boss
I can hear blur mixed with flight of the concord sung by robbie williams
Am I the only one thinking he's talking about cum?
❤️❤️❤️❤️
they are really into french new wave films.....
i love all the songs on the new album, but this one is beautiful. the cinematography of the music video, the lyrics, the sound of it... i'm in love
prima sort
It’s kinda cool how at 1:50 you can see the cartridge for city life ‘09 mentioned in sculptures of anything goes
Arte
hola
What a poor song compared to do you wanna know
He sounds like he s in the wrong key to me. Is this deliberate?
The Car está a un nivel superior
Los amo Monitos Articos
Lpm escucho esto todos los dias y no me canso, si se la sacaron con este temon
I'm drowning
Put me in a coma now! Boring pretentious crap. Lounge music at its best!!
ビートルズというより、７４年頃のジョンレノンからウイングスみたいな展開が面白い。懐かしい感じがトレンド追ってなくてクール
💎💎💎💎💎🇬🇧💓corona capital  2022🇲🇽🙌🙌🙌👏👏👏
Interesting quirky song and The Monkey's style reminds me of the Brit Pop band Cast.
In a few hours I’m going to see them live for the second time in my life I’m so lucky
Awesome tune, voice and depth of sound
Ha!
Alex goes Hedwig and the Angry Inch...YES!!!
It’s a parable
I feel like this is 'Four stars out of 5' - Part 2. You don't necessarily like it the first time, but the more you listen, the more it grows on you. The layers of creativity in the video and lyrics is just *chefs kiss 👄👌🏼*
Tranquility base took some growing on but this is grower too, reminds me of tlsp
Ayo im sorry but this is horrific
ALTA CANCIÓN LPM
Gran influencia de The Beatles,  John Lennon está muy caracterizado en la voz
I going to see this band live this sunday 13th in Buenos Aires, i still can't believe i going to hear this song live 😭
🎡💓
Gives me major David bowie vibes and I love ittttt
This song REALLY grew on me. Arctic Monkeys have great range
AGUANTE CHILE CTM! MAÑANA NOS VEMOS MALAYAS QLS!
💖💖
My god, this is terrible… What happened to the arctic monkeys? 😢
USed to hate Tranquiliy but this song changed my mined!!
Es una obra de arte, no entiendo porque tan infravalorada😿
I love it
💖
4:06 this gesture is too good
https://youtu.be/-G8Q-EuJtkg
The beatles?
2:21
This may sound weird but I feel like I can smell this video… and it smells like something familiar and warm.
So perfect had to buy it on LP.... AM FOREVER X
Esque genuinamente no puedo
Foi lindo ver vocês em Curitiba! Voltem sempre ❤️
1st listen - poor 2nd listen - still poor 5th listen - good  10th listen - unbelievable
wey, soy sólo yo o esto es demasiado The Lemon Twigs?????
Gives me Bowie vibes 😀
Most dogshit chorus I’ve ever heard 🤣
I feel this song can be interpreted in so many ways. But as someone who  lives in Korea and has lost friends to the Halloween Itaewon crowd crush disaster - this hits deep. Crying.
Raw
City life 09 1:50
No fue un AM 2 pero amo el rumbo que tomaron, creo que se fue más por el estilo TLSP y al principio no me gustaba pero lo termine amando
Such beautiful photography…
Thank you Brooke Linder!
Que música magnífica ,álbum the car perfeito 😍
Been hearing this on the radio for the last few weeks and was wondering what the title was. It's brilliant.
Love the Bowie sound.
Vocês são maravilhosos em tudo que fazem... Que álbum! Que momento! ♥️
EU olhei e disse: ARTISTA !!
Thanks .... !!! playing my David Bowie records again now , but such a cool song from th Monkeys ....
Body paint haunts me even with a "Full Moon". ^😎^
I love The Car, this album is amazing; they do what they want when they want and how they want and that is what music is all about ? ❤
Nem acredito que tive a oportunidade de ouvir ao vivo. O álbum de estúdio é belíssimo, mas ao vivo tá maravilhoso. Os caras não estão de brincadeira, magnífico!
Ya llego el cura pibes...  Yo y los cura pibes: ♥️
amazing
Finally I strongly connect again with a song of theirs since Secret door. What a masterpiece!
i only have one problem with this song, he sounds a bit like he’s on helium. i love artic monkeys but it’s not my style personally, and that’s okay! if he was singing like he was in arabella for example tjis would probably be one of my favourites
Love it
Absolutely loved this new phase!
Absolutely loved this new phase!
Eu amo essa música ♥️
E incrível como as músicas deles sempre são boas já estou viciada nessa música
alex (and the monkeys of course, but i emphasize alex as he is the lyricist) never hesitates to be himself. he is always the artist he wants to be. he has been my inspiration since I was a kid and still is. i aspire to be like him because that is how you become a great person. monkeys were never scared to change their style, they did it and somehow also preserved their identity. the result is amazing, the century of the band if you ask me. and the lyricist of the century for sure
reminds me of a modernized psychadelic era Beatles. loving the direction these guys are going in
Bowie is that you?
I would love to know what people think he’s talking about on the lyrics…😂😂😂
David Bowie would be proud.
Underrated masterpiece
no estoy acostumbrado a escuchar canciones así de artic pero está muy good
#I'mnottryingtosoundsliketheBeatlesbutmaybe
Es cine🚬
1:51 The simulation cartridge for City Life '09
Buenísima 💯🤟
que wena rola gente inglesa
I prefer the old stuff of AM than the new ones, but we have to admit that this pure British RnR band lives its own mature period.
<3
i don’t want to be another comment saying how good that they discovering new genres for themselves. i just want to say how much i love this one particular song, whole album is amazing i can’t stop listening to it. this feels so perfect listening to this while walking alone on the street of european city im currently in. releasing it in autumn seems just natural to me. so, yeah, im,  basically, obsessed, album is perfect and this song is even more perfect im not even talking about music video. i really am happy for discovering this music band, hope most of the viewers feel the same way.
Masterpiece.
This is the most new 70:s song i've heard in a long while. Sounds like a mix between The Broughtons (ca Parlez Vous) , Strawbs (ca Deadlines) , Heavy Metal Kids , Genesis , Foreigner ( debut album ) ,10 cc  and  a sprinkle of City Boy on top......You can almost hear some Supertramp in there to.  - Well done lads.
Best song in the disc by far.  Most original, creative and amazing videoclip I've seen in a very long time.  Truly, this is a joy to the senses.
y pensar que ya paso un mes, sigue siendo increíble lo buenas que son todas sus canciones
hands down the best song on the album
ALEX POR FAVOR ESCUPEME TODA TU DISCOGRAFIA EN LA CARA!!!!
PINCHE ROLON ESPECTACULAR TE AMO COMO NO TE DAS UNA IDEA
There are pieces of this music that reminds me of Bohemian Rhapsody and Elton John :3
Holy kino
Love this new album sm
this is kinda cornerstone vibes and i love it
It's gotta be their own take on the beatles strawberry fields. Melody, key and tempo changes, different riffs. Its almost like 3 songs in one. It's class
POV: You're listening to The Beatles, but they are actually good.
Beatles all over this
i luv arti monki
Que lindo o trabalho de vocês... maravilhoso 🤩🤩🤩👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🎸🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
That lyrical loop at the end had me laughing so much first time I listened.  Beauty song this is, classy and funny 👌🏼
Reminds me of "Don't look back in anger" and late Beatles, of course. Just gives me that nostalgic thrill.
With the benefit of hindsight, we can now see what they were trying to do with TBH&C but they just managed to miss the mark. This time around they have hit it. Perfectly. The Car is a coherent and complete album from start to finish. A masterpiece
Sond and video remind of A Day in the Life by the Beatles
God dammit Arctic Monkeys! I fell in love with this song and i can't stop replaying it!
you guys are the literal best
Very McCartney.. love it!
I bet the new album will be selling like ghost cookies.
Who killed the artic monkeys how depressing they are now used to be the bollox
I don’t think it’s bad but I do miss the oldArctic Monkeys
Alex Turner is my sexual orientation
this is awesome for sure liking more this album than the last one
igazi gyönörű remekmű, rendesen meghatódtam, mondhatni begyöngyözött a szemem
This whole album is sung and played with the same persona of Tranquility Base Hotel monkeys. I imagine the character Alex sings as in TBH&C made this album in his heyday or at least some time before he's been relegated to small gigs to make it by.   I had been suffering for months to find anything similar to their last album I'm so glad to have some more songs to have on endless replay.
They make all that old film stuff look sexy
God damn it, 2:45 has to be one of the smoothest shots ever. I love it so much.
might be their best album
I’ve never listened to Arctic Monkeys before but since randomly hearing this song on the radio I’ve fallen in love with it … and this music video is absolutely beautiful, I can’t even describe it.
Mi cancion Favorita del album 👏🏼🐒🚬
It all vocally sounds the same, every single song on this album, I love arctic monkeys, but just dont think his voice suits this sound just like previous albun
El mejor tema del album 😍
krlho macacus do ártigo
Que rica rola
INCRÍVEL!!!
This song it’s so magical
🥰
Dengan vibes yang cukup mirip dengan Album Tranquility base, The Car punya racikan musikalitas yang lebih lembut dan mengigit. ada nuansa David Bowie disini. Arctic Monkeys dan Alex Turner telah tumbuh.
what a musical masterpiece
The Beatles vibes
horrible esa mrd arriba The Strokes
im drunk its great theyre hot
THIS IS THE BEST MUSIC VIDEO O F ALL TIME I CANT BELEVE THIS
Magrite live
LA AMOOOO
Incredibly derivative of Bowie and The Beatles, bordering on a rip off in fact, but still very good!
(MIRGA), Make Indie Rock GREAT Again!
sounds like something from Bowie
As much as i wanted to dislike this album, just last like their last one i can't stop listening to it. i actually think this is better. Nothing that has ever been produced that is of a high standard can ever be appreciated first time
I love when someone makes MUSIC and this Song Is.
The boys are getting older ❤
Classic classy Sophisticated
Alex and the Boys follow their instincts  I think God leads them 🙏
My wife just asked if Stewie Griffin sings this 🤣🤣
it’s like a slighly more sophisticated and strings-heavy Submarine vibe. I like it
I can really hear The Beatles influence in this song particularly from 1:36 when the beat changes
This album is incredible.
Best song of theirs in ages and ages immediate favourite
a literal work of art
2006 till today there is nothing better than the ARTICMONKEYS!
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Hoy nació la música
banger
These tunes don’t get tiresome they get better and better and better and better this is different gravy iv been listening to it on repeat every detail is phenomenal! Even down to the ha!! At the end  So predictable I know what your thinking ! This is Luxury Rock !!
Fucking absolute classsssssss
This song is so intense and so B-B-BANG GOOO I mean-
thank you kojima san
thank you Arctic Monkeys
Always transcending trends and breaking boundaries. Never change changing 🔥
1:51 City Life 09 "The simulation cartridge for City Life '09 Is pretty tricky to come by" cit. Sculptures Of Anything Goes
To me, this one grants one of the best positions in their entire discography. It's absolutely fantastic!
I absolutely love this song, it's like a mix of David Bowie and The Beatles ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Nice one! The best song in my opnion. Huge ❤️🔥
The song definitely grows on you
This song reminds me of the Beatles
Nice taste Kojima
Hermosa!!! Por fin música después de tanto tiempo algo que merece la pena escuchar todo el álbum esta increíble y al que no le guste, puede seguir escuchando cualquier cosa.
this album sucked shit
Absolute garbage. Got to credit them for their consistency 😅
NO ME GUSTA! me encanta que a la banda le vaya super bien! que tengan buena critica! y que este tema este volviendo loco a los fans! pero a mi no,  no me gusta hacia donde esta llevando la banda y el sonido Alex Turner.
It starts with Paul and then ends with George and John, with Ringo all throughout. Alex is doing his own thing with the vocals. Little bit like early Bowie at the end, but does a Paul style "Yeaa" at 4:04 - This song is soooo great!
i guess music videos are back !!
I love what they evolved into, I don't want to hear "fans" crying about their old sound. I am an Arctic Monkeys fan, I am here for each and every masterpiece they serve up on platinum platters. I try to listen with my entire being and I do my best to figure out the meaning- your sound is unquestionably unique. That is why I am here, the senseless rambling of radio music is tiring but , THIS, I can bask in the beauty of.
I wish you guys would return to monke but its cool to do your own thing since the classics will always be there :))
3:00 🖤
Very Grizzly Bear influenced! Great song
So Bowie
What an absolute banger ❤‍🔥
Melhor música da carreira de AM
and if u r thinking of me, im probably thinking of u
I've heard this song twice well three times now... and I woke up today with the lyrics going around my head. I really like it ❤️
Sounds like an oldies song
This is just shite.
IS THAT MILES KANE IN 3:55 ???? THAT HAS TO BE MILES KANE THATS SO COOL
0:54 Sounds like Bohemian Rhapsody's piano motif
I Did love these guys but last few albums are trash 🗑
Esta canción es algo más...
The simulation cartridge for city life 09 referenced In sculptures of anything goes might not be so hard to come by. :) 1:51
This song is a masterpiece and you can’t tell me otherwise
Arteeeeee
No suelo comentar a mis cantantes/grupos favoritos y que me gustan, pero bueno, ésta canción me ha encantado 💜
I'm in love with this song
the next star child
Los amo Arctic Monkeys, sin ustedes no vivo
Very stylish,thoughtful video 🌾💮🌸🍂🌿🙂🙂 x
Está hermosa
Definitely channelling David Bowie in'Heroes'era including bomber jacket look 🤗💥💮🏵️💥🌸🌿 Paula x
The references to other songs off “the car” album in this video is fantastic.
Loving the new style more and more
temoooon
<3
Sounds like Bowie 👍
Nice to have Spacehog back
I feel so much Sgt. Pepper’s energy🔋
Esa mirada me hizo el amor
So predictable, I know what you're thinking ....  Bro, I really felt that
Best stuff yet! Brilliant!
que temon loco amo todo
thank you for so wonderful
this album and tranquility base hotel and casino were my absolute favorite. like suck it and see, A.M, etc. but tbhac and the car album 😘🤌. i get more and more blown away as they release music. fucking icons
i’d die for this man.
I can't fucking wait until Alex actually gets into a girl who's into him, too. Imagine the music that will come of that.
For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed to lie in Do your time traveling through the tanning booth So you don't let the sun catch you crying So predictable, I know what you're thinking My teeth are beating and my knees are weak It's as if there's something up with the wiring You can poke your head behind the mountain peak Don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding So predictable, I know what you're thinking I'm watching your every move I feel the tears are coming on It won't be long, it won't be long Straight from the cover shoot Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I'm keeping on my costume (keeping on) I'm calling it a writing tool And if you're thinking of me, I'm probably thinking of you There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face So predictable, I know what you're thinking Ooh, ha Yeah Yeah, ah
The visuals are so amazing
That solo is pure bliss
Sou muito fã, essa música ficou muito boa. Parabéns pelo trabalho 💐
siento un tipo de conexión con David Bowie, uno de mis artistas favoritos, me encanto esta canción!!!
It has me trapped and I don't want to get out.
Y es que Arctic Monkeys no se equivocó diciendo esto: Y si estás pensado ,en mi probablemente esté pensando en ti 😿
IT'S THE SONG, FUCKING IN LOVE
IT'S LIKE HAVING SEX WITH THE DAMN SONG
Ufff mis oidos se sienten bendecidos.
Ya son los "arcticbeatles" estos weyes
Best album
amo arctic monkeys sou fã desde 4:35 min atrás amo alex turner jair bolsonaro eu so qero a tua rola encaixada na minha xoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooota
Sex sound 🔥🔥
as a taromancer and Arctic Monkeys fan, I absolutely loved the tarot reference
one  of the worst songs  of all time, i thought it was coldplay at first,  now we got 2 bands that sucks  equally hard.
song of the year
i miss old arctic monkeys but this song is absolutely great
Muy Beatles, me encanta ❤❤❤
For all the fans who loves this song or the musicians who loves Arctic Monkeys, I've uploaded to my channel the isolated tracks of this song generated by A.I. (bass&drums, vocals and instrumental). Thanks for watching and dropping in!
Excelente
😴😴😴
Beatles style
This has really grown on me. Wasn't that impressed first listen, now loving it and playing it for the 15th time.
Incredibly beautiful video. The video and the song complement each other so much
I loved "Whatever People Say I Am That's What I'm Not" and " Favourite Worst Nightmare", did not like the route they chose, but I have to give them credit, every album from them is solid, every single one. Pretty impressive, making really good albums and yet so different from each other.
Obsessed with this masterpiece
This feels like it could be a multi million dollar musical.
People will say it has hints of Bowie and later Beatles. Correct, but it's the Manchester Arctic Monkeys. They are shifting now into greatness. Superb song, love to hear a full 12 inch version with that guitar playing out to the last note. Superb!
This might be the first song of theirs I don't like... :*(
I love this album its a James Bond soundtrack
Feels like it could be a bond song
para mí, la mejor canción del disco ✨
dios los amo
So we're just going to ignore that in 1:20 they lint-roll a velveteen suit, that is what Mr Schwartz chorus says!
Just love the taps on the mic at 1:03
❤️❤️❤️🤌
Who did direct this?
This is actually one of my favourite songs of all time
4:02 is everything
Ansioso por el 17 de noviembre. Los esperé una vida.
Guys please, add one more date in Manchester !
Hmmm. Not sure on this one
It's brilliant ❤️
fuck, this album is a masterpiece
te quiero mucho alex
Whisky, a cigar, weed and this. Holy..
This is like the aftermath of tranquility base! I love this like so much.
Súper extremamente exceso de finura en esta hermosa canción
Big Beatles vibes
Precious!💪
Esto es tan estoy tan feliz de escucharlo después de la espera
Best song on the album for me, It’s if TBHC and AM had a baby. Has both the chill TBHC vibe with a mix of AM with the solos and change of tunes
The best song in the album
fire
well done
Man I never could get into the arctic monkeys but if this album is like this song this may be my favorite album in a long time…. It’s just so complex yet simple it’s a great song from the lyrics to the medley to the riff at the end just masterfully put together
kos amo wuachos🥺🥺🥺🥺
Boring music, not like before
Fucking love it!
Reminds me of John Lennon ❤
the best!!!
this is a complete masterpiece
it's time
2:15 nick wondering when he’ll be put back in the basement
Todo es maravilloso<3
Thanks for the song, it makes me reflect a lot 🍷🗿
Alex and the band have evolved so much since hits like Florescent Adolescent and Cornerstone. Just amazing! I am enjoying the new coat of paint.
if Alex sang this to me I'd die. he knows sexy I can't
i have listened to arctic monkeys my whole life. i remember the first album i heard (whatever people say i am that’s what i’m not) and the growth in the music is absolutely incredible. They have helped me through so much and i don’t think there will ever be a day were i don’t love their music with my whole heart. thanks arctic monkeys :)
Es mi de mis canciones favoritas personales ❤️
These window panels in a circle remind me of Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Awesome video guys.
1:52 city life '09
el mejor tema del álbum lejos
What a masterpiece!
I love this...
They've listened to a lot of Beatles surely!!
its 2 in the morning listening to this album, smoke some cigarettes. i don't know just felt like a coolest guy ever
cada disco alex turner se pone mas bueno
So far, I'm liking their style and new songs, but I think his voice from 10 years ago would fit better to these songs.
Que buena cancion csm
Best song of the new ones I’ve heard so far
this is a cinematic experience wow
😾
I love you❤
I used to think AM were pure shit, but now I just can eat all my words 😭
Drive our musical car, Alex ! 🔮👌
uuuuu ❤

THIS IS MY FAVORITE SOUND NOW
best song on the album
I got goosebumps 🫠
é incrível como eles não erram nunca, eu estou apaixonada nessa.
Sounds like Robbie Williams.
3:59 lolllll, love that
looks like an orientation video from Orchid Station from Lost
Official music video of the year❤
Solo con esta canción valió la pena esperar 4 años... gracias por tan hermosa melodía. los amo AM 💕
Agradecido de estar vivo y escuchar semejante obra de arte
Un honor coincidir con Arctic Monkeys, ¡Viva la verdadera música! 🤟❤️‍🔥
I love u Guys

Felps gostou
Elton John has signed in.
Creo que en este videos nos dieron los nombres e imágenes de las próximas canciones del nuevo álbum the car.
I love alex turner 🫶🏼🫶🏼
Lennon lives in our monkey hearts.
🥸
Meu Deus, isso tá tão perfeito
Well I must say it's a no from me
In love with this song
it's as if David Bowie had met Freddy Mercury and they had gone down to see Elton John....sublime song
💖Beatles vibes 💖
Somebody has OD'ed on Bowie during the Pandemic.
3:03 by far the best bit of this song, honestly love their music so much
Is the first time that I listen arctic monkeys in my life
Bowie-Duran-Williams. It's almost pornographic...
QUE BODRIO
Mia Khalifa !!
very nice cinematography
humbug era redefined.
Sacred geometry. I really think Turner is trying to tell us something with the last two albums
Siu
some next level beatles shit
MUCHOS HABLAN DE EVOLUCION  Y TODO ESE ROLLO pero la cruda realidad es que quien evoluciona solo es ALEX,  los demas ; SOLO SIGUEN SUS ORDENES. Matt  de ser UN GRAN BATERISTA Y TENER UN BUEN NIVEL ahora solo lo vez haciendo cosas básicas. A mi parecer,   EN VES DE EVOLUCIONAR el pobre  INVOLUCIONA y retrocede a lo mas básico ESO no se llamaría  EVOLUCIONAR eso se llamaria DESPERDICIAR EL GRAN TALENTO QUE TIENE como baterista
Awesome song - cannot wait for the Album. Lots of love to you all from around the Universe :D
The tanning booth line and the mountain peak line are absolutely wonderful.
I'am from Brazil and i love soo much Arctic Monkeys (⁠ ⁠◜⁠‿⁠◝⁠ ⁠)⁠♡
Beautiful !!!!
I love AM but this has to be one of the worst songs I’ve ever heard
Love this song 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
just wow
Hearing this song (and some of the others on the album) just makes me even sadder that the collab album between 'The Last Shadow Puppets' and 'Lana Del Rey' got scrapped. I mean it was cool as frick to have Miles duetting with her on 'Dealer' (I freaking love that song!) but hearing all the vibes so far for 'Car' just makes me realise what a stunningly beautiful, artistic, sonic creation could have come out of a full album. Alas, this album is exactly what I've been needing to hear, so I can't wait for release day.
I'm a father of two now, still listen to Arctic Monkeys since i was 16. Listen to their new music makes me want to relax from stressful work life.
AMO ESTA CANCIÓN!! Desde la letra hasta el vídeo 😭👌
this song is like crack
😵‍💫 It's Brion Gysin’s “Dream Machine,”  come to life in tonal-technicolor.  Egads, it's amazing.
Passando minha vida ouvindo arctic monkeys
La escucho todos los días pq es muy buena
Extremely good visuals, extremely bad auditory experience. Please listen to "The Haunted Youth", 'cause they are the opposite: bad videos, excellent songs.
Habiendo salido tres canciones ya de la era The Car, ésta por lejos es mi single favorito, desde la letra hasta el video, simplemente es una Obra de Arte 🖤🛐 No puedo esperar a escucharla en vivo en el Primavera Sound!
Chido
booooooy are these fuciking growing on me !
I LOVE YOU
Very Good. I remember John lennon when i listen this song
Pure josh homme guitar vibes at the end of the song..Great tune..Love the monkeys
this video is so satisfying
I love the  fact that in the era of 4 chords same melody and lyrics on repeat, there is someone out there making real music just like older day. We learn from what we see and hear and i definately learnt being fearless and creative from Arctic monkeys
Man, This Album is going to be a Cinematic Experience
Sounds like the box of songs david Bowie threw away in the trash.
THE WAY I GET TO WITNESS AM'S MUSIC MATURING MORE AND MORE OVER THE YEARS 😭
i love you am
thanks for making this kind of music🙏🏻
One of the best music videos I've ever seen and ... felt.
The beginning sounds like something from Mac Demarco?
viejos preciosos
los amo}
MASTER FUCKING PIECE OF ART
the piano makes me want to hold Alex's hand
Funny: A sweet  Sonic Youth reference…  blowing’ out  the young  monkeys & letting in  the ROMANTIC  GROOVY ARCticS🎶🎵🎶  Nice.
One of the best creators of all time, Alex Turner & Arctic Monkeys! This sound just reminds me so much of a Bohemian Rhapsody's vibe!! Divine.
3:01
So grateful to be on this musical journey and experience with Arctic Monkeys.
mantab
Máster and perfect 😌
I was convinced it was Charlie Day for the first 30 seconds of the song
I made a cover of this song!! i really hope u give it a chance :) thank u very much 🤍
I wonder if this Alex still asks if anyone wants some margaritas
que hermosaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Me recuerda a The Beatles
This- this was incredible. I have no words to describe how good this is. It touched me, and there's a real good poetry in the lyrics. Happy to listen to this. Glad to have met Artic Monkeys.
Canción favorita de las 3 que han salido de The Car ❤
Eu te amo
David Bowie in da house. Love AM!
Se le acabó la cuerda a los monos
Wow, what an incredible song and what a journey to this point. This track sounds like the White Album produced by Jeff Lynne, fantastic stuff Monkeys!
18-10-2022
It's awesome. The thing most important that I've seeing
Arctic Monkey’s a true music geniuses
QUE BUENA CANCION DIOS MIO CSMM
dios
ARTE
hermoso mv
These new tracks are so cool. They're basically challenging their inner Jazz, David Bowie and Beatles feel in a way
nice music, but the middle part is strange
OMG THE END..... ❤️❤️❤️ IS THE BEST, WELL EVERYTHING EVERYTHING
Hoesntly I can appreciate this music, it is fantastic won’t never say the opposite but I have to admit that I miss the old times:/
Bowie like genius.
They can NEVER make bad music. If Arctic Monkeys made covers for other songs I’ll believe they wrote it
Nice Gerry Madsen and Bowie nod.
THANKS FOR THIS MASTERPIECE 🥺🥺🥺💜💜💜💜
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
EU AMO VOCÊS
This is simply splendid. But the live verson on Fallon...EVEN BETTER ❤
i love arctic monkeys
LA QUE MÁS ME HA GUSTADO AHORA, que hermosa está 😍
All the live versions have been genuinely so much better so far
Looks like I have officially grown out of Arctic Monkeys, a lot of people will enjoy this music but I'm sadly not one of them. Everything up to AM was gold for me (although AM itself was quite different from the classic Arctic Monkeys) , but after that I just do not feel invested enough, their new direction does not appeal to me. Still, thank you Alex and co. and I hope you guys keep up being amazing !!
Cool music video but cornerstone’s was better
LOS MONOS SE DESCONGELARON
this puts such a smile on my face
The Arctic Monkeys are a great example of a band that has aged really well. Not all the bands are capable of this, some tend to go pop, which is ok. But the intention of being original, to propose something different, is just an act of bravery.
I absolutely love their new era IDC that some basic fans dislike it these are definitely some of my favourite arctic monkeys songs
Wow that was boring.
esa vozzzzz
Amei a música 😍💖
Love it! 🎉🎉🎉
What a gorgeous tune. Thanks guys, absolutely brilliant!⭐⭐⭐
This gives me major TLSP EYCTE vibes
this is so beautiful holy shit
At the beginning of the song I keep waiting to hear.. "fools on parade...". Has that Secret Doors vibe
I am the biggest Arctic Monkeys fan here and it's not even close.
As much I respect arctic monkeys I don't like any of the skng dive heard off this album. That's not to say its well made or anything but I just prefer whatever people and F.W.N. A.M for me was middle ground
artic slow monkey😢
The evolution of Arctic Monkeys from being Rock/Pop Indie to Retrospective Indie genre. Brilliant and well-composed music ever since Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino, only for those who understand their concept, entails a vibe and story to a certain age of time.
3:33 mi parte favorita ♡
This song kinda suck just like ameera forhead
Mmmm tasty
Im torn between thinking that they’re trying too hard to transition like the Beatles did, and liking it.

Viciante essa! 😅❤
Beautiful.
Impressive sound, you never dissapoint Alex. 😏
I was 14 when I first listened AM in 2005 ! And it's my favorite band ! Since that day , I've been growing up with them!
♥♥♥
A jewel of the 21st century. The more I listen to it, the more I like it.
A band mixing their music style with the times is refreshing as fk🙌👏👏👏
Their style may change, but the quality of the music will forever be amazing
Many years from now, in the future people will understand and appreciate this piece of art. Call me a fool but I believe Arctic Monkeys will surpass Beatles in their popularity and significance.
"Bowie changed his sound, Radiohead changed their sound blah blah blah" - but they got better and better, and more and more exciting. Changing your sound, for the sake of it, with no real idea what you're trying to achieve, means you end up sounding like 1990s Robbie Williams😂 Switch this video, with a video full of Robbie Williams images, and you could convince a lot of people it was him.
This made me want to tear up, Alex, I love you.
los amo monos por ustedes vivo<3
Are we just gonna ignore the line "Do your time traveling through the tanning booth So you don't let the sun catch you crying" This is extraordinary poetry
A masterpiece
Wow! From the cinematography, to the vocals, to the guitarist, drummer, the bassist & all the subtle meanings in between... What a masterpiece
ay 🥺
Mas uma pa eu chora
1:40 is this the hand of cameron avery?
Alex Turner looks older and I don't want that :(
1960s vibe
Fucking leg(end)
Huge fan of the cinematography in this, really well done
I love this fucking song 💙💙
Вспомнил Джона Леннона почему то
I would kidnap Alex and Nick Cave and hold them in a studio until they come up with a double LP.  🤣
Just loved the guitar solo.
актеры 10/10 сюжет 10/10
that little chromatic guitar phrase around 4:13 is one of the best things he has ever done. so badass.

I lot of people are going to hate this new Arctic Monkeys album but the tracks that I have heard are a band that have grown up and I love it boys keep on listening to the boss Mr Richard Hawley
Masterpiece ✨
Vocês superam tudo!!

Sounds like a David Bowie song to me 💯
That violin gave me last shawdow puppets vibes
the music in this song is everything, perfect.
I fkin love this song so much. I can’t stop re playing it! ❤
Genial
Arctic monkeys all grown up. I loved every moment I've known your music. ❤
Mans this is eargasm
Smooth drums
sim eu estou ouvindo essa musica desde que ela foi lançada eu te amo arctic monkeys
❤
My favorite part is 0:00 - 4:36
My favorite part is when Alex Turner sings
Dislike this all you want, they have been part of half my life, but…am I the only one who is really missing “them”? Other bands like Queens of the Stone Age are getting older too but they keep being them, not a (undoubtable high quality) hotel lobby / elevator / “songs for sleeping” setlist music.  One álbum like this is a nice incursion. But two? Is Matt or Jamie really enjoying playing this? Sometimes I think if it is only an Alex thing. I have been in the gigs every tour but last one was confusing, when they played this new songs atmosphere went dead and from this to the AM and pre-AM pure joy, but even this old songs did not elvated the audience like before, with forced accents and slow tempos.
Feels like Arctic Monkeys doing a cover of TLSP who did a cover of someone else. Which I like!
This is so amazingly good
THIS SONG IS SO SEXY😩❤
Beatlesque
Getting some very serious David Bowie vibes from this one. I love it.
i miss the arctic monkeys.
É... É oque tem né ...
This gives Elton John vibes
Alex Turner remains strikingly beautiful.
AM is the band Oasis always wanted to be...
I just can't find the right words to express myself about this song! 😍🤯🤯🤯
Yup Alex ya mad fecker ....top man
La voce è strepitosa, ma molto particolare con len sue variazioni di tema il brano.
Arctic Monkeys is the other name for consistency. World changes but they stays. Love you guys❤
Love The Bowie Inspiration
I loved the song so much when I first heard it, I adore this vintage vibe they've gone for lately, and now the video which is sooo satisfying to watch 😩🤌🏻 looking forward for more!
Stunning. Love the aesthetic of this one
Putamen - can - tó
Q música boaaaaaaaa 😭
Starter
Gorgeous
They're not the "crazy" teenagers that released the previous stuff. They're older now. And with their experience they give us even better stuff. Love it.
hoping too see this live 5 may!!
That opening verse is so Thin White Duke era Bowie I couldnt help but love this
this is beautiful, listened to it an hour ago, played it non stop.
finally a guitaaaaaaaaaaar, I miss that so much! Good song, cant wait for the album
منورين حبايب والله احبكم اسمي ضبع من الحلة صطعش ربيعن بس واعي قرام وعبثي درجة اولة تحياتي
I will still love and cherish just as much as i do with I wanna be yours and a lot more popular hits of this incredible band!!!
Amo esa canción dms
when you combine arctic monkeys gene with queen gene, this is the hybrid gene of both
With this boring kind of " music" of course they are already old at just 36. I can't recognize them anymore. Slowing down doesn't mean become so boring and repetitive....they did several song in every old albums that were more or less slower, but often lovely and unique...but this??:,(
Nunca decepcionam, lendas.
Im so Excited for this omy goshh
zzzzZZZZ
This song is awful... I don't understand why my daughter thinks this band is the shit.,??
Amo cada coisinha feita pelos macaquinhos do ártico aff 🥰
I don't why, but the melody made me hears like bohemian rhapsody plus shadow puppets songs
VOLTA CRIPIM MEU AMIGO 1:00
Melhor banda!!! Este álbum está maravilhoso de lindo, parabéns aos envolvidos.
the wait was worth it
I freaking love this song
⚡
Beatles+Pink Floyd-ish
KOOL
masterpiece.
Fuckkk i love Alexxxx❤❤
3:01 what drum kit even is that

I love this band with my whole soul.
This song still gives me so many feelings even after I’ve listened to it a bunch. Just wanna get up and dance. Can instantly put me in a good mood.
Such beautiful cinematography, I was driving around listening to the scooooore
3:28
Joder es hermoso el nuevo proyecto
Jdr en vdd amo a Alex, todo le sale tan perfecto 🥰❤
Insanely well made music video, they're setting up for album of the year
Esse novo álbum é de uma vibe surreal ❤
music for girls
Pinche solo bien cabron me para los pelos de los huevos 4:08
lol chainsaw man op got more view than this. Hell of a song song though
Certain parts of this song wouldn't sound out of place on sergeant peppers. The tone of this song is beautiful and Alex's voice is getting better and better
Bowie versus beatles
Amazing <3 . Makes me think of the Cosmic Crooner videos!!!
Alex ♡
anjirlah enak bet bgst adah...
🇧🇷
Utter brilliance
most of us have been listening to this band since 2006. It's been at least 16 years. I was around that age when I got to know that the Arctic Monkeys were going to be my favourite band for a long time. We're not teenagers anymore. We've all aged. This new album proves it, they've evolved, and so have we. I love to feel we're growing old as a generation and this sound is a proof of that fact. Cheers to all of us.
Proper getting Beatles Vibes from this song...
I love this
Magistral I ❤ Arctic monkeys
Almost sacked it off after the first two or three listens, however  after watching the live version on the Jimmy Fallon show last week,  I now "get it". This new record could well be their finest. When these boys release music. An entire generation knows about it.
it's original I like it
was very great i love you
MASTERPIECE. That's it
Amazinh
Kubrick vibe, phenomenal
Fair play if you like it you like it. It sounds shit to me, goes nowhere and bland af.
I think this is a confession to indiscretion,  it makes more sense and is darker, when heard through that perception
Only the big band has the courage to change .....like Artic 🦧
Another album I will skip then. Too bad.
Alex has been and always will be my first love musically from my late teens. I feel he’s been there in my life milestones and can’t thank him enough for the music he and the boys still make. ❤ 🥹
Ill admit i dismissed the arctic monkeys when first heard them. It was when Florescent Adolescent was released. I remember telling my friends they were a "terrible band with a terrible name" and that they would "come and go faster than my ex". Boy was i wrong. AM released during what was probably my most formative years alongside " ..like clockwork" ... the second I heard "do i wanna know" i realized I was wrong. AM was my 2nd fav album of 2013 and became one of my top 5 of all time. I dug i to the backlog and discovered many of my curre t favorite songs. TBH&C initially disapointed me but eventually i remembered my claim that the band may well be the bealtes of my generation and accepted and enjoyed the sound. Mirrorball and body paint have solidified my claim. We are entering prine Arctic Monkeys.... the songs they release from now on will be remembered for generations the same way we all remember Elelanor Rigby or Sgt Pepper. This a band transitioning from childhood into adulthood. And aging quite gracefully
4:12 is the best part of the video
me gusta más este álbum que el anterior. Volvieron al indie
the “hAH” at 4:00 gets me every time
Bowie vibes?
i love it
despite this sounding like tbh+c, it still has somewhat a distinct flavour to it.   tbh+c feels like a sci-fi ish mixed with classic soft rock of a record. this feels more like a nostalgia-inspired, swing type jazz rock. cant fully point my finger to it but the instrumentation in this is sweet which is complimented by alex's unique voice techniques
nostalgia hits like a truck when its in the shape of a truck
obra de arte isso vey 🤌✨
Me playing with the mirror Effect when i approach my phone: 0:44
I believe the use of a film camera for this clip is really grand, and adds to the melancholic vibe of the song
this song is so good I already know it’s going be in my top 5 of the new album.
Sounds a little bit  like George Harrison's songs
I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO STOP LISTENING SINCE THIS CAME OUT OH MY GOODNESS VOCALS ARE ON POINT THIS IS PERFECTION
Best song of the band...
Love u guys 🔥🔥🔥🇰🇪🇰🇪
I've been listening to arctic monkeys since day one. As a young man I loved their bold and wild music. Now they have matured and I love it! It sounds so round and so good. The base has a beautiful line and everything fits. Great music!
why?
I swear the last minute of the song is pure heaven. Heavy Floyd vibes and I am here for it.
honestly, to place my personal opinion about the arctic monkeys now is that, the fact that they are getting older - their music is changing by time - their beats and rhythm is slower compared to their songs before when they were younger, it shows how much they are changing not as a band but as individuals and with this, it makes me smile, the fact that you can recognize their music slowly change along with them as they are getting older. i will always cherish their old songs as they still relate to me as i am still young myself but i will continue to listen to their latest songs to get a new taste, an older taste of the arctic monkeys. thank you arctic monkeys for your amazing music back in the 2000s and thank you for bringing such good music even now, no matter how older you guys get, you'll always be my top 1. favorite band ! :-) thank you for reading this !
my first time listening to artic monkeys (besides the obvious famous stuff). fucking hell. music is alive.
If this is your new adventure, I'll get on the boat, the destination doesn't matter...
So is the plan just to get another full Alex album? I just wish we could at least get 25% of the songs featuring the strengths of the other band members. They've got one of the best active drummers and you barely use him anymore. I'm debating ponying up a lot of $$$ to watch them at Red Rocks in September -- the greatest venue in the US -- perfect for the loud sound they mastered -- but the last time I saw them live on their previous album tour they had zero energy/chemistry. And I say that as someone who saw them play MSG during the AM tour with 100X the energy. It's Red Rocks, so I lean toward they will have energy -- but I would just hate to go there and get the same Old Yellow Bricks and Teddy Picker mixed in with wayy too much of these last two albums.
Who feels David Bowie's vibe in here?
The last scene with the boys is so magic and makes me so happy that I end  crying 😭
My favorite release this year. Simply a Masterpiece!
Basta, es hora de confirmar que amo Arctic monkeys 💗
OMG
love it
masterpiece
MY FAV VIDEO
OMG ITS SO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
🖤🖤🖤
Alex turner I love you
Fans ❤️😍
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
that was incredible
Reminds me of Bowie
LUVETTT
Wow they're blowing Bowie so hard here and it's fascinating
Malísimo como el anterior, ni una sola chispa que te mueva la sangre. No me gusta el nuevo destino de la música, donde quedo el ADN de Artic Monkeys? 🤔👎👎👎 Boringgggg
⚭ body paint ⚭
eita bbs
This sounds like Beatles
❤️❤️❤️🇧🇷
Worst Arctic Monkeys song ever.
I'm so glad they're going for the Tranquility Base vibe again, even though that album received a lot of backlash. They don't need to prove anything to anyone, they're just making art and I love it 🖤
the more i listen to it, the more i can't stop
Just like Humbug and Suck it and see were necessary to the development of AM, Tranquility Base was the start to The Car. What a banger will be released this month, i am so excited, what a great single.
Not what I was expecting but love what I got
Un efecto de sonido me sono a the beatles como ven?
So good
You're broken if you dislike this.
Great song and love the music video, bravo to everyone involved.
They're entering their art rock phase
I love arctic monkeys ♡
Monos articos forever los amo
Enserio los adoro
Son lo mejor
Son lo mejor
Los amo son lo mejor
Mis amores son lo mejor me llenan de orgullo cuando escucho sus canciones
Amo esta canción es lo mejor
Los amooo mucho son mi vida
Los amo hice stream toda la semana
La mejor canción 😍😍😍😍
yay
it's not really my type of music but I'll listen to this while I'm studying 😌
UST to love them last album was shite this song sucks. Hope they make some decent tunes again soon
"And if you're thinking of me I fantasize about you too "
I carried mine with me..body paint..
Is this what happens when you combine ELO, Bowie and the Beach Boys..🤔 perfection 😍 could easily be a Bond song as well.
Partió el craneo
Arctic Monkeys has this incredible talent of making you fall in love slowly with a song I feel. It never truly hits you on first listen, but when you listen to it more you're absolutely hooked on the layered beauty behind it. This composition reminds me a lot of The Beatles, the non-linearity of it and the separate sections of melody that somehow still maintains this new album vibe. That middle drop of orchestra section is such a Penny Lane/A Day in the Life throwback!
I like that they play the music they want to play (or that Alex wants to play) but let's be honest, it does not top their early music, and doesnt sound original rather like weak Bowie or Beatles.
this is very Bowie..!!!
amo vocês <3
This song could easily be like 7 minutes long or something, I really wish they enter into longer songs. Absolutly loved it
alex turner is da
all the callbacks to other mvs of theirs in this one and in mirroball...
Vai ser um bom álbum para curtir o fim do mundo 💣💥💥
crazy how this song goes from "yeah it's cool" to "holy fuck once again it seems like i'm obsessed again" over 3 replays
I love every album they released sounds completely different, love how they explore what ever is in their minds and make it pure art. I feel so grateful to be part of their era, be a listener of their feelings, their songs, and their writes.
What is this harry styles ahh music
Someone been watching ‘Velvet Goldmine’ ! It’s Brian Slade
Les amo tanto
it's ok
They went Beatle-esqued with this one. Amazing
I'm in love with this mv?!!!
I love this song
It's timeless.  From any era.  From every era.
Simplemente, obra maestra.
wow
.
im fucking obsessed
FUCKING A, this is pure old & satisfaying rock, luv u AM
love you guyss
I wish this song would have more of an "explosion" in the end like "Sweet dream TN" has. I don´t mind their slower sound, but I feel that they missed an opportunity here to make it a bit more interesting. Stil a solid 8 out of 10 though
Pure artistry.
I love it so much <333
reminds me of Bowie
🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐
Mate just said it sounds like Robbie Williams trying to be edgy and it can’t be unheard. Mirrorball is just class. This just isn’t very good. Throw it in with Brick by Brick and hope it’s just an odd dud
Boring as fuck
this hits different
beautiful monkeys
My brother told me there was a new song released by Artic Monkeys,he said the first time you hear it it's not that good but I you hear it twice it gets better
this song give me the last shadow puppets vibes, i love it
who else freak out in this minute XD 2:16
0:37 is this Miles Kane?
Amazing!
i lvoe this bideo
still here
"Body Paint" spends a 2nd week at #1 on the New Alternative 40 Chart
Estupendo
Todo está bien de esta canción, pero no dejaré de repetirlo. La voz de Alex es superior, no sé, tiene algo en la forma de cantar, en el timbre de voz o algo, pero es 🛐🛐
I love what they've grown it too!!!
This isn't monkeys, this is the Alex Turner Show
That guitar is something else
♡
bowie vibes....  the last few songs atleast.... i like it :)
Fine wine 😭❤️
I heard someone say "I miss ya" at 2:22
miss the old arctic monkeys…
This song really puts me in the AM album many were looking for.
well holy shit
Very Bowieesq
they came back with everything, this is just pure Art.  i love it so much i love the song i love the video i love EVERYTHING about it.
Literally the best song
I listen to the Arctic Monkeys so much this is getting out of hand
Alter ego of David Bowie...😉
Arctic monkeys + the beatles = body paint 👌
OMG!! I'm obsessed with the song, and general with Arctic Monkeys!! I love you!!
Love artic monkeys but Polyphia is killing it make sure you show them some love
fabulous as alwaysssss<33🌠🎸
Miren a Alex Turner con esa voz y todo vintage su cara parece estar tallada por los mismos Ángeles jejeje
Yeah, definitely done with this band. Enjoy the lounge singer era remaining AM fans.
This is brilliant
suena en radio doble nueve 99.1fm
LINDO LINDO
I heard this on the radio today lol
David Bowie & Beatles vibes
This is ART
This is the first Arctic Monkeys song that I like.  Great job.
The video is stunningly beautiful.
boys have officially lost the plot. what is this lounge shit? even Alex side project whatever the fuck that was called is better than this
THERE’s SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SONGGGGG 😭
Me encanta
راقي
im now 31 and ive grown up with this band... and i can say im liking this stuff cause i dont reckon i can bounce around like i could back then haha
What an opening line! To say a liar has made themselves a bed to lie (/tell lies) in! On a par with Dylan’s ‘the highways made for gamblers, better (/bettor) use your sense’! Incredible.
Fcking awesome video and that tune is one of the best I’ve heard from these guys
glad they're not doing rock and roll again.
This is an AMAZING song. I don't really care about what old Arctic Monkeys fans think (I myself am 29).
I love you Alex!!!
i love the visuals 😩
Holy fuck boys, David Bowie is back!!
That guitar solo is solid.
I just want to say that, every time you all surprise me more. I definitely love all this... so even though I can't go to some of those concerts that you’ll will give on the tour, I want you to know that I love you all, and I love everything in your style as an artistic and personal proposal. You all are in my heart, and I know that if I write this I will not feel empty, since I have already left a sample of what you mean for me. Thank you. ✨🌻  PS: i definitely love body paint. The video is Amazing !!!💎
wooo
Brilliant
Jesus Christ Alex Turner is a terrible singer
I can’t wait to watch them perform their new songs live ❤ 😭
I Love the song I Love you Arctic monkeys 💗
It had been so long😢❤
I can’t describe the way I feel when I listen to this, it’s incredible. If these 2 singles are any representation of the album, I truly believe it will be a masterpiece.
I couldn’t stop smiling❤
HALLELUJAH AMEN PRAISE THE LORDBOFY OF CHRIST LOVE IT LOVE THE ENERGY PLS PLS PLS PLS IMA ASCENDING. TO HEAVEN AMEN
some bits of it remind me of songs from submarine
Awesome track!!!
Like Silverchair - Diorama
UNlike this nonsense song (boring)
Refreshing to know that we still have a band capable of brilliance, in the current music scene! 😄👍
They need to be more like Red Hot Chili Peppers, change up their sound as the albums go on but still maintain the essence of who they are. The last album and so far Body paint are just not it imo.
I mean it's better than anything from their last album but it's still not great. Hopefully, the rest of the album picks up a little bit. Unsure why Alex can't do his pretentious nonsense elsewhere.
Great Takes of the unexpected episode
Whatever people say that's what's on my face
totally boring
i just love this song fr 😞
eres un perro alex turner te amo
W song
genius
No puedo creer que los vea en un mes 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
Beautiful masterpiece so many influences Inc lots of Bowie and perhaps some Lennon... Love this track! 🎶❤️
Bond 26: Body Paint
I mean it's nice but I miss their early frenetic days. Favourite worst nightmare is a musical heart attack.
This song is about 'Jack Steven'.
Alright you lot. Calm down back there.
They are evolving into a 21st century version of Beatles.
Va beh … nn capisco cosa sia successo ad Alex , ma a me gli ultimi lavori fanno …comunque questo è un bel pezzo
Arctic monkeys >>>>> any other band
Damn I love this song ❤
Shite.
Video looks like it should be on Ashes to Ashes (the tv series) love it
Leoa, estive aqui.
sounds like the closing song of the soundtrack for 'sing song round the money tree'
Who else here has seen these boys become men at the same time you were? First time I saw them they had pimples all over their faces and looked all small and nerdys, and they are now stylish men and have defined an era of music for many people (and I hope they are still a bit nerdy). A pleasure growing up together with their music.
that solo holy shittt
Body Paint, ya se volvió mi adicción  Mientras la guitarra llora dulcemente
Very very David Bowie like. Gotta love it
Ye, I loved this new song
LOVE that every AM album has it's own completely unique vibe!!! It's what I love the most about this band ❤️ And the fact that they don't even have ONE bad song. I LOVE the Beatles vibes, I'm so here for it aaaaaaa
https://youtu.be/VZfqadoKj24
Oof. The cure for insomnia right here. I'll stick with the first couple of albums.
bu album muthis olacak
James bond theme maybe
I will miss those days of  "I wanna be yours"
Always and forever artics❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
AGUANTEN LOS MONOS💗💗
this is awful
True artists. They can do no wrong.
Como eu amo o indie ❤❤❤❤ meu gênero preferido
this gives me the last shadow puppets vibe ... and im all in for that
Sounds just like tranquility base hotel with an added piano/organ
Man this song gives me "A day in the life" vibes, by the Beatles.
The strings, the guitars, Alex's heavenly voice. This is some Beatles/Bowie level music making.
I think this is gonna be my favorite one from the album, I'm impatient to hear the other tracks
I put this song without headphones and my dog looked at me with the most confused face of the world when Alex started singing. I guess she doesn't like it lmao
Guitars 🔥🔥🔥
El ritmo increíble y la voz de alex espectacular el mjr grupo
Essa música é tão.. 🥀💖 Traz uma vibe de recomeços e mudanças. É a primeira música nova que ouço dos macacos do ártico desde o álbum AM. Dá uma sensação de nostalgia, porque tudo parece diferente do antigo, uma nova fase está começando. Fiquei com receio no começo, mas agora aceito que é necessário seguir em frente e estou aberta a novidades. Sejam vocês mesmos, macacos do ártico ❤️
tranquility base 2
🥺
I hate everything about this.
If I was a girl or good looking guy I would "F" this Alex guy.
❤‍🔥
I didn't think they would do Tranquility Base 2, thought something like that could only be done once. But they're freaking doing it again and I couldn't be happier. The fact that they didn't just replicate AM for the success it made just proves how genius of a band the Arctic Monkeys are.
Que música chata! Pode ser cult, mas eu esperava uma música muito mais enérgica deles!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
AM and favorite worst nightmare the best albums
La pongo para quedarme dormido, nunca decepciona 👌🏻
Are there going to be any bangers on this album?
Non mi piace
This sounds like Bowie, Elton, Queen, Beatles and Mika at the same time. I'm obsessed.
ya se le empieza a notar la edad al Alex Turner
Ooh such a cool video, loved it!
Necesito saber significado de  simbolos. Me obsecioné con este video ptm.
Hello from Russia with VPN
3:37 🔪💔
Sobbing crying throwing up 💧👄💧
what a masterpiece
I didn't know Heisenberg would make a surprise appearance in this video
Quando você acha que não pode melhorar eles lançam uma obra prima 🛐
I feel like obi wan when anakin joined the dark side ..
Now thats what I call MUSIC ❤️❤️❤️
This is the most disappointing transformation I have ever seen in music. Nobody else is gonna say it but this video looks like a first year art student's failed, pseudo-intellectual attempt at depth.
so fucking good
I want fucking rock n roll back! 😭😭😭😭😭😭
This feels like a warm hug in hard times ❤
holy shit i love Alex, but the actor who played oliver in submarine was such a good fit that i sometimes get the feeling of how much he has grown when seen Alex in a video kjsbdf
it is a masterpiece ❤🇷🇺
I love it <3
I'm amazed
reminding me to evangelion neon genesis.
Tão macia quanto veludo e ao mesmo tão forte❤️
WHY DO I LIKE THIS SO MUCH WTH I DON'T EVEN LIKE TRANQUILITY
Can't stop listening. Just wow ❤
classic Alex Turner straightforward lyrics, love it
welcome back guys!
Why am I getting Bowie vibes from this! 👌
w
This sounds a lot like Ashe
big fan
Voy a llorar
Now I can die in peace, it's the best I'm happy
the king is back
Piece Of art ! 😍😍 A bit Of Eleanor Rigby in the inspiration no ? Love it anyway ! ❤
what a fucking banger man.
1.25x sounds much better
The music gives you what you didn't know you needed , the lyrics are so artistic they become subjective to each of us we relate to it in our own different ways yet they are the same words phenomenal ! ✨
anyone else listened to this like 50 times by now?
Nada q ver con este estilo, pero salió un nuevo EP y no te lo podés perder.  SOLO LOS VALIENTES LE DARÁN PLAY Y SE METERÁN EN EL VIAJE https://youtu.be/LuPX1TCipOg De nada :)
perfect
Aging fine like wine
Alex Turner is a musical genius and is my lord and savior Jesus Christ 🙏
THATS SO FUCKING AWESOME
ZzzZZzzZ
Me recordó a David bowie!
listening to different songs from them from different times like the difference between alex’s voice in fright lined. dinning room and let’s say r u mine is so cool
Teamomuyo Arti Monki
01:40 a perfect mixing beetwen Eleanor Rigby and She's Leaving Home (Beatles) 02:30 Guitar remember a lot "Isolation" (John Lennon)
AMOOO, VIVAN LOS MONOS ARTISTICOS
So predictable I know what you're thinkin'
lo amé <3
This song echoes The Beatles and Bowie so much!
0:29 “Looks like The Riveria, coming into land” 👀
"he knows what we're thinking" Mr.Turner knows we're all gonna think something is up with the wiring of this new album or song even, but it don't mean their old style has "gone in to hiding". he's watching our every move, the song might start bringing the tears on for people who can relate random life experience to the song lyrics.  But at the end of the day he's going to keep this current "costume" on to use it as a writing tool. if the fan's are still thinking about the arctic monkeys, the Band is probably thinking of us, the fans
Does anyone know what the name of the Blue Beverage in this music video is? it looks like a tasty drink and I must have one immediately
Eres tan predecible que se lo que piensas... Ha!!!!
I can't help but think the two clips at 1:08 are a JFK assassination reference. A rifle and then the umbrella man signal ???
David Bowie!!🤩😍👨🏻‍🎤🙏
RUIM DEMAIS
Arktyczne małpki wymiatają
They music make me feeeel i. A good mood
I love youuuu
This sounds so The Last Shadow Puppets f@%$ yeah !!
3:02 i want to recreate this
🟢 60' THE BEATLES                  🟡 70' DAVID BOWIE  🔵 80' GEORGE MICHAEL  🟠 90' BLUR  🔴 00' QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE     ⚪ 10' ARCTIC MONKEYS  🟣 20' ARCTIC MONKEYS
oooooon yer legs and ooon yer arms! Lyrical treasure chest are Ar' Monkeys....🕺
This might be one of my favorite albums of all time made by Arctic monkeys
Its shite man
xdios, la hermosa voz de Alex me da tranquilidad.
I'M IN LOVE WITH THIS SONG, I LOVE YOU ARCTIC MONKEYS, ILY WITH ALL MY SOUL <3
It is something in magical language
Like beatles. I love british rock.
Desde el disco AM ya no son arctic Monkeys. Son the last shadow puppets lo que no es malo pero ya no tienen el tono que los caracteriza de arctic Monkeys
Bits of influences from Oasis and Beatles, and a lot of AM. Nice
the cinematography is beautiful, this is my favorite video, i love you guys!
I love TBH&C (the Best album), and I love this too.
arctic maymunlar allahutealaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

troll masters
This song is a piece of sh... But I freaking love it
Lyrics:   For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed to lie in Do your time traveling through the tanning booth So, you don't let the sun catch you crying So predictable, I know what you're thinking My teeth are beating and my knees are weak It's as if there's something up with the wiring You can poke your head behind the mountain peak Don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding So predictable, I know what you're thinking I'm watching your every move, I feel the tears are coming on It won't be long, it won't be long Straight from the cover shoot, still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I'm keeping on my costume, I'm calling it a writing tool And if you're thinking of me, I'm probably thinking of you Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face So predictable, I know what you're thinking
Por alguna razón esta canción me produce una sensación de nostalgia
I can't believe how these lads keep raising the bar! Sheer quality all round!
this is like a crap version of bowie on coke with the beatles
estas reduro alex
When Alex said "onion legs, onion arms and onion face" I cried  🧅
4:00 he looks like a turtle lmao 🐢
Murder 101!
Absolute masterpiece
❤
alex yaslanmis..
What a beautiful video.
Poético
This got David Bowie vibes, so cool. Love you monkeys ♡
I really feel like after their AM album they really changed their sound from a sort of fast pace, punk rock with 'some melodies' type sound, to a depressed, shower pace, and 'entirely melodies' type sound, and I don't really like it :(
te amo
“There’s still a trace of body paint on your legs and on your arms and on your face”
I want to like this video every time I watch it. There should be "double-like" and "triple-like", etc. buttons as well.
an absolutely masterpiece
Yo solo escuché a Bowie :(... temon por dioh!!!
The cinematography is incredible. Beautiful. And what a song to lead us through it!
OMFG I REGRET NOT TURNING ON NOTIFICATIONS
Wow, I love this new The Last Shadow Puppets without Miles Kane
The ending of the song is pure perfection!!
Genius
what happened to arctic monkeys they used to say things like "You used to get it in your fishnets now you only get it in your night dress discarded all the naughty nights for niceness landed in a very common crisis" now they say things like " I'm keeping on my costume, I'm calling it a writing tool" it doesn't hit as good there is no vibe to them anymore
I like how people tell the Arctic Monkeys to go back to their high energy songs, bruhh they aren't gonna listen to you. Do you really think that a few comments would be enough to shake their opinion on music that they make? 💀💀💀
Getting the Riot Van vibe!
OMG
So predictable I know what you're thinking
I can’t tell you how many times this has been played since it came out , I think it’s absolutely amazing, my family is annoyed because of how many times I have played it 😂
Idk what this music genre is called but I really like it
w
Lo único malo es que termina  Que joya!!!
I've already loved this album. I think Alex's voice is really strong and smooth in this song and in Mirrorball.
This video has me shouting 'Bravo Vince' every 5 seconds
Jack stubber would totally make a clay animation to this and im totally digging it
Alex just saying you are clowns (body paint)
This song just keeps growing on me. So good.
THE BEST
I love anything they put out… but I’m craving some AM style bangers
makin tua makin jadi
so so so unique and wonderful
Ugh
Ta lindo, obrigado ❤️🥺
simplesmente.
this song is just amazing <3
Spetacular!!🎉
“for a master of deception, and subterfuge- youve made yourself quite the bed to lie in, do your time travelling through the tanning booth so you dont let the sun catch you crying”  ive gotta say very rarely has a song lately caught me like the way those first lines have me coming back for a relisten every day at least three times lol. poetry!!!
es mejor am haganlo de nuevo
They should change their band name..no 🐒 vibes anymore..
AHAHAHAH
AMOOOO
Amooo
now I'm more than happy ♥️
cosita linda, cosita bien hecha <3
Me da vibras jack stauber
His voice is AMAZING!!!!
Wonderful, amazing, I love it so much thank you AM for another banger
If want to sing autumn like that
OH MY GOSH----
This song is completely amazing!! I'm very excited to listen the full album🥰
I've never known a song hit so differently from hearing it for the first time on the radio, and then hearing it along with its music video now
Pinche cancion toda hermosa.
So are we getting another Alex Turner album with Matt, Jamie, and Nick playing music?
It has a beatles vibe to it
pure @Mika vibes....
4 minutes if Alex ‘American’’ Turner making love to himself Utter utter utter tosh He is now the man he used to parody
The first album was epic. After that it constantly goes down and in the meantime they are irrelevant. Very sad.
4:01 HA!
Mark my words people, this song will go down in history.
Elton John vibes ✨️
Ahhhhh yes my sanity has been brought back to me thank you arctic monkeys and Alex turner🤌😫
I really miss the real Arctic Monkeys 😔
как же интересно за этим наблюдать...
To tao orgulhosa de vocês
Isso aqui é elite
Wow, so good
Absolutely love the direction they’re exploring. Can’t wait to hear more
ахуенно  спасибо
All I can say is, I've bought tickets to see the Arctic Monkeys next year and I'm willing to sit through this to hear "Snap out of it'
I love nick and his bass lines
q hermosa cancion amo de vdd
Work of art.
Im absolutely loving this album so far
Anybody else getting Bowie vibes from this?
no dejo de mirar esto, es increible
Que belleza analógica
https://youtu.be/ALJMWi8qhhA
...don't let the Sun catch you cryin...
Dios me encantan😭❤️
lo mejor de lo mejor, siempre por siempre, artic la voz que te hace volar, es excelente
They are like wine...The older the better...
Has a certain David Bowie feel to it.....love it!! The Arctic Monkeys never disappoint, Alex Turner is AMAZING.
wat is dit godverrrrdomme een lekker nummer!
Love them ❤
DIOOOS BUENARDOOO
I love you Alex
Man I remember picking up Favorite Worst Nightmare in Amsterdam. While I came back from my first Iraq deployment. Big fan ever since. I love the way they've gone soul. Love this band
Seems like a great song... but just not for me unfortunately. I thought AM was one of the best albums of all-time... but the last 2 albums just don't do it for me personally. I do hope they go back to their earlier styles and move away from this phase they're going through.
Ill wait here till Alex decides he wants to stop tryna be like David Bowie
This really reminds me of David Bowie
This is unbelievable - can't wait to see them live again in Glasgow next year
First 2 seconds and i just loved ❤❤
Thank god Alex is no longer Mr Satan
It's incredible how their styles changed throughout the albums and still all fit perfectly together when playing live
I just want a heavier album a follow on from AM their best album hands down, this is so self indulgent to me
I don't know how to explain it but, even though this album explores a new sound they never explored before, it sounds so much like them, it feels very genuine and that makes me so happy for them, they deserve all the love and praise ❤
This is what it feels like watching your heroes die
Los amoooooooo😭❤️❤️❤️
Alex aging like fine wine 😍
Wonderful Alex
Very beatles-esque, unpopular opinion but I hate the beatles, not for me this one 😒
heisenberg
McCartney vibes off this one.
https://youtu.be/VZfqadoKj24
I actually love this song. That keys melody is very 'Queen-ish'. Proper journey tune.
I miss energic song from arctic monkeys.
they kinda lost their game a bit, sounds more like Alex Turner + Band than an actual Arctic Monkeys record.
Oh look Another arctic monkeys masterpiece Ima listen to it till I decide to delete it
I fucking love Arctic Monkeys   Alex Turner is pure art, he is the incarnation of art, he will die being the most fucking erotic shit in the entire galaxy. I have no words to describe how much i enjoy every album.
0:3 y 2:48  esa melodia, es magica, una bomba emocional que eriza mi piel 🍃💫✨🎇
this is such a masterpiece in every aspect; the poetic lyrics, the instruments that tell a story themselves, too, intermediality, cinematography that left me speechless, editing of the shots that always change on beat, the lighting- each one of them, connected together, create a masterpiece called Body Paint. it is amazing what we can create using art- it lets us literally do anything, we can express ourselves in any form and any way we really want. there are no limits,  there are no wrongs. as a cinematographer myself, I find this music video  and the one for There'd Better Be A Mirrorball truly amazing, I know that I will be coming back to them really often and I can not wait for the new album!
"Body Paint"  For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed, to lie in Do your time traveling through the tanning booth So you don't let the sun catch you crying  So predictable, I know what you're thinking Ooh, hah, yeah  My teeth are beating and my knees are weak It's as if there's something up with the wiring You can poke your head behind the mountain peak It don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding  I'm watching your every move I feel the tears are coming on It won't be long Straight from the cover shoot  There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face  And I'm keeping on my costume And calling it a writing tool And if you're thinking of me I'm probably thinking of you
This song sounds like the perfect blend of Elton John & Paul McCartney with Alex Turner's genius lyricism.
I might start liking them now they sound less aggressively Northern
Replay, replay, replay, replay, replay....
Is this a Bowie tribute?
There is a bit of AM in this Bowie!! I Like it!xd
AND IF YOURE THINKING OF ME, IM PROBABLY THINKING OF YOU
Mirror ball was okay, this is too like TBHC. I’ll pass on the new album I think!
Arctic monkeys for Bond 26
Not far from rock Opera's, not so far from uncle Bowie's, always with their own borrowings... always free.
Debuted on my weekly personal music charts in October 2, 2022 edition :)
<3
I don’t care what anybody says this is the greatest song I’ve ever heard
I am obsessed
Are you lot listening to something else, because I guarantee he knew this song was a load of shite, before releasing it, he's taking the piss out of am fans who like anything they put out
😻😻😻😻
beautiful<3
Te amo arctic monkeys, teamo infinitamente
Talvez no sea una de más más escuchadas pero si una de las mejores ☮
A masterpiece 🤍
Es una muy buena canción, armonizado , la esencia de ellos plasmada tal cual, si la escuchas en la radio aleatoriamente sabes que son ellos... Aún así debo decir extraño su explosividad cómo en AM , esperaré ansiosa el álbum completo
The beatles song
OK, I'm totally hooked. Looking forward to "The Car" even more!
No se si se conozcan o hayan hecho una colaboración pero me encantaría poder escuchar juntos a Brandon flowers de the killers y Alex turner tienen unas voces increíbles y cada quien tiene un estilo muy especial.
I felt that 'HAA' at 4:00
Temazo
Diossss Alex no envejece 😍😍😍
😮alex u soo genius 🤩
i missed them
increible una mejor version de hotel and casino que emocion vuelven a peru por favor !!!
Their music reminds me of The Beatles and how they would write fast songs when they started off and later on matured and started putting more thought into their lyrics or instrument playing and make it beautiful.
This is the kind of songs you listen now and think "this is going to be one of the best songs of this times".  ABSOLUTELY FLAWLESS.
NEW ALBUM WOWOW
O vocal do Alex está incrível, muito melhor do que no disco anterior. Incrível evolução da banda!
Awful
22 years old and i'm still spilling drinks on my city till death felling unique with this awesome band
😱
Fomeke
these songs are easily and by far the best music they've done in their lives.   anyone can @ me. I will fight.
Bowie lives!
This song gives me Beatles vibes, Arctic Monkeys are the absolute best
mat helders extrañara tocar canciones mas movidas?
WELCOME BACK I MISSED YOU
Why is he singing in that key? It's obviously a bit of a stretch for him to master. Besides that it sounds like a b side for the last shadow puppets, which isn't the worst thing in the world.
I love you guys
Wasn’t this exact song on the last album?
💞🇺🇾💞🇺🇾💞
this is so beautiful.
Muito bom véi.
:D
Waiting for the brand new album of TLSP... Ohhh, is this Arctic Monkeys?
O M G
Boring Alex masturbatian. Picnic music!
Are those the name of the tracks of the new album?
I feel like I grew up with Arctic Monkeys and they grew up with me
After the last album is was not quite sure, but now I know that I underrated the Arctic Monkeys all the time
That “HAH!! yeÉeeah” is just exquisite tbh Bloody love you, Alex. I love the zero amount of fucks you give ❤
this is so david bowie-coded idk i love it sm
Buena  rola
Дуже гарна пісня !!! Алекс як завжди супер !
Soooo predictable I knowwwww…watcha thinkinnn ♥️
awful
This is a fucking masterpiece.
Only had one listen but there is something about this that reminds me of the beatles   .its different but there is definitely a thread here...I hear bits of revolver,pepper and the white album in it,.there is a backing vocal hamormy that is pure Lennon but Alex's vocal sets a nice juxtaposition to make it a new original thing..their thing..I think in 50 years (if we  make it!) the bands  albums will held in the same regard...i would like another last saddow puppets next time..it will be time for tlsp 3 by then.
They're killing it with these new music videos.
SOMEONE IS FUCKING ACTUALLY SINGING IN THE 2020S
"And I'm keeping on my costume And calling it a writing tool"  so excited to finally listen to The Car. the song itself gave hints to the theme of the album, with alex turner finally stepping out of the characters he's created for so many of the albums and no longer hiding being dense metaphors to get at what he's trying to say.
Body Paint Lyrics  [Verse 1] For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed to lie in Do your time travelling through the tanning booth So you don’t let the sun catch you crying  [Chorus] So predictable, I know what you're thinking  [Verse 2] My teeth are beating and my knees are weak It's as if there’s something up with the wiring You can poke your head behind the mountain peak Don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding    [Chorus] So predictable, I know what you're thinking  [Bridge] I'm watching your every move I feel the tears are coming on It won't be long It won't be long Straight from the cover shoot Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I'm keeping on my costume And calling it a writing tool And if you’re thinking of me I’m probably thinking of you  [Instrumental Break]  [Refrain] There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There’s still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face  [Chorus] So predictable, I know what you're thinking  [Outro] Ooh, ha Yeah Yeah
This kicks ass
ô Alex Furking Turner, para de ser perfeito!!
Obsessed
"And if you're thinking of me, I'm probably thinking of you". That line is simple, yet beautiful.
klip o kadar güzel olmuş ki şarkıya odaklanamıyorum.
Very David Bowie / Spacehog
'the fool' tarot card could be the band's way of telling us that in this album they'll be making a huge change and being unapologetically themselves. here's what the upright fool card traditionally means if it comes up in a reading according to thetarotlady:   "If you are considering making a major change or accepting an opportunity, the presence of the Fool says: go for it.  Jump in and don’t think twice. Take a new route, even if it feels a bit precarious. Do not concern yourself with what other people think at this time – this is the time to be unabashedly YOU. Don’t be afraid to be seen as “foolish.” Take a carefree and humorous approach. Laugh. Be willing to let go of transgressions.  Travel lightly."   "
alex’s voice makes me levitate
You call this music and performance?
ISSO TÁ TÃO INCRÍVEL!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Una completa obra de arte, los amo ❤️✨
🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭
Zzz
Fucking mint
you guys have been bringing me a sci-fi vibe mixed with some old-fashioned romance (not in a bad way) and, perhaps, some fantasy. love you and i'm so excited to be in your show on primavera sound, brazil 🇧🇷♥️✨
I was there from the start at early gigs for £6 a ticket  in 2005 or so.  Great band but I supposed they can't keep doing the same brilliant album tracks forever ... Quite a dull song and similar to the last track released.   But hey ho they will still grab a top slot on the album charts.
They've reached a level of maturity in their music that's unprecedented at this early an age.
3:59 when i see a kid running and i know hes bout to fall, then he does
Coke is a hell of the drugs , kids
The way they make that guitar cry does something to my body
They got so boring
Oh you like The Last Shadow Puppets, Tranquility Base, David Bowie, and the Beatles? Well they recently just had a baby.
Welp, Arctic Monkeys have officially turned into Alex Turner and Band. Yawn
David Bowie total mano, maravilhoso ❤
GAH it's so fucking good. I was hoping for more TBHAC style, but different. And they have delivered. I love it. Such brilliant mood music.
Suenan como la cancion de a tu recuerdo de los angeles negros
So happy to have new music coming from the boys! Waiting for a Toronto show 🙌❄️🐒
When can we expect Alex to announce his debut in a Broadway musical? 🙄🤔
Lembra muito o início da música tema do filme Expresso da meia noite. 😍
I LOVE YOU GUYS🙁🙁🙁
mi mejor decisión a los 13 fue haberlos elegido como una de mis bandas favoritas, los amo😭❤
obsessed with this song
There will be no favorite Arctic Monkeys song. They're all already superb, special, and really gets you in the mood.
ART!
Greg James singing in a band,,radio 1 live lounge,,,coming for body paint ..
amini sijktğiklerim
Tanto tempo esperando
Música e clipe estão perfeitos nota 10
Cara Alex velhão slc
Just cause somethings different doesnt make it good
Hear alot of Beatles in this song. I love it . Another catchy hit 👌
Alex's voice is a hug to my heart 😔✋💓
Go back to the regular singing.
this music video is an absolutely wonderful experience.
Gibson makes another appearance
Body Paint fuckin' smash. It's a HIT 1/1
Nice. But should have been in the precedent album.
Love it ,❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰 love your music 🎶 Alex your the best.  Love the work of art , innovation the genuine and passion that you nd your put in ur music.  Can't wait to see u LIVE IN CONCERT . May God bless you and your family always and keep on coming those badA** songs ! There the BEST.. love it.. your my #1 BAND U GUYS ROCK! 💯🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
beautiful istg
I´ve missed you terribly, thank you for coming back to fill my soul with your fantastic otherworldly music. I love u
I love these guys! Haven't heard from them for a while after there last album, but their back! I love how they have evolved and I love how they have the same vibe as TBHC. Love you guys! Keep up the amazing work!💜
I feel extremely sorry for Matt Helders, one of the best drummers in the world and they're not utilising it at all.
Hoy revivio la industria musical:
Thid videoclip is so coolll
YESSSSSSSSSS
alex started his daddy era ❣
Quite an artist, this Alex.  #OdedFriedGaon #OdedMusic #Audioded
I can hear some David Bowie in there 💜💜
perfeitos
ok
beeatle style
The last album is unlistenable and this seems to be just as bad. Anyone defending this is the equivalent to someone enabling a drug addict. There’s no heart. No passion. It’s empty mid tempo trash. It sounds like they tried to copy Bowie but one of his bad albums. You guys don’t have to support the current thing. Try being objective and honest for once in your lives. Bands fall off. That’s what you’re hearing here.
Nice. I do miss AM though. We need more of that then crooning rock in 2022.
another slow song greattttt……
It feels like something between The Beatles and Queen
Ok, the band is finally over
💋❤️
Wow  I fucking love the old albuns, but this change of pace the band has take is really interesting. Glad they have the freedom to evolve!
Some pink floyd vibes ❤
Why is this video forbidden in Russia??
So predictable.... I know what you're thinking
ALEX TURNER THE MAN YOU ARE
Body paint stands out but a spiritual heart blends into the crowd.
AM SO HAPPYYYYYYYYYY YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYYAYA
It's not bad, I just can't get into it. So boring, sorry
Excellent.
loving this new era
Now it's fully settled, i love this retro vibe ❤❤❤
i know it's far-fetched,  but it smells a bit bohemian rhapsody but in a good way
I love to be in the era same as the Arctic monkeys ❤️
I LOVE THISSSSS
This is great but sometimes I really miss British punk arctic monkey's
Alex being like Lennon in 1:40
He is a fucking genius. We all lucky to live in the same generation
suena muy a los beatles, justo al fav de Alex.
You can’t compare this to the last album this is great what an amazing ending rock n roll
Some scenes reek of works by Rene Magritte.  Bravo
1:40 The Beatles
I have to re-discover Arctic Monkeys like I would discover a band for the first time. But, this is something I can listen to. The last album was too much for me. This is good.
All the sensations that an AM song causes me, is what I feel... I feel... <3
Are they taking the piss?
4:11
Only the Arctic Monkeys could do such a beautiful piece of work! Thank you all for giving us quality!
The song is giving! ITS GIVING!!! This video is giving scp foundation/the backrooms and I love it
queen?
Love it
Love it 😻
This is dumb
I mean their songwriting is obviously still incredible but oh god Alex's vocal melodies have been rapidly declining.
a brilliant mind, everything he does is beautiful like him #alexturner hombre bello...
Alex is Bowie incarnate.
The Director of this clip is  Brook Linder 🥳✌️🤓✌️🤓✌️🤓✌️✌️🤓
I don't understand how a band makes every new album better than the last....its just....how....
temazo
What the crap happen to this band
Amazing melody, but the vocals 💀💀💀💀
Hay que ser sinceros!! Cómo que la melodía , la forma de cantar de Alex no cuadra... Y puros fansboy diciéndo; que arte , que buena música para mis oídos etc. Sean sinceros señores!!! Este nuevo álbum me huele a una copia de tranquility base hotel y casino, álbum que no estuvo del todo bueno... Adoro a los monos y los escuchó desde el 2007 pero esa forma de experimentar nuevos sonidos y melodías como que deja mucho que desear . Espero equivocarme y que cuando saquen el nuevo álbum escucharlo por completo y cerrarme la bocota...mi calificación para esta canción es de un 6.5...
I am straight but for Alan I am gay.
This song is so beautiful, the only thing I wish is that they did something more with the lyrics at 3:00. Maybe changing them up or delivery. But overall so amazing. And the cinematography is so steady and pretty. just wow.
La estaba escuchando a velocidad x1.5 y me gustó más que a velocidad normal jajaja
THEYRE COMING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
brit pop perfection
Beautiful
man ive been such a am listener  and this is awesome how alex s vocals have been better over the years and the musical genre and tastes too etc  we ll never have the AM of 2006 but whatever this album looks far better than the last one already
nice
amo todo de este video <3
2:16 me cagué todo con auriculares jsjs
Amazing music video. The cinematography is excellent
i love how each album has a different kind of vibe and sound, and it’s so amazing. 💜💜
i love you alex i love you artic monkeys
Hermoso
La chica que amo, ama a arctic monkeys, asi que aqui estoy, pintandole un cuadro mientas escucho su música <3
Solamente necesito decir que los admiro mucho y sus canciones son mágicas <3
Alright gonna need a tour asap
❤❤❤
This song came out while Hurricane Ian was putting my town 6 feet under water. I'll forever look back on these days with this music in mind. But some times the trauma makes the music so much sweeter
It's like a mix between The last shadow puppets and Artic Monkeys Humbug and Tranquility base hotel and Casino
alex turner is a songwriting genius
Gracias Arctic Monkeys por nunca decepcionarme
Good written and orchestrated song, but something tells me this will be the most exciting or upbeat song of the whole album.
Mirror all was cool, this sucks
AMAZING SONG, VIDEO
utter shit...... is this his Lennon phase? He's been thinking he was John for ages so might well be...... This song makes me want Mark Chapman to get paroled and a plane ticket to Sheffield
Loving this track. Can hear bits of Father John Misty, Mini Mansions, Bowie. Great guitar solo too.
I also like don't let the sun catch you crying lyric which is an epic song by Gerry and the pacemakers
This reminds me of The Beatles.
Good, but I like the one on Jimmy Fallon better
Essa música me deixa dopada de serotonina
Whatever people say they are...
Wanna listen to
Can't wait for your tour in 2023
Amoooo<3333
2074 🔊🎵🎶
Fácil mente puede ser una canción del álbum blanco se nota la influencia pero igual esta muy god.
Beatles
love this version of a day in the life
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
AAAAAA MAS PERFECTA LA VOZ D ALEX😭😭
there’s still a trace of body paint on your legs and on your arms and on your face
That musicality! Their best so far.
It's been a few days and I still can't get away from this song. My magic monkeys.
Хорошая попытка... но! всё равно,  по запаху, это рузкое Говно.... И нет выхода ему в Мир. Потому что Говно.  к тому же, рузкое
I miss Arctic Monkeys
Complimenti, puro stile brit.
Omg i lost it when everything started to spin
I love the Steenbeck! I hope the new record comes out on 35mm Mag.
Sounds like Beatles in a way
*The Beatles except make it safe*
No words… They can‘t explain nothing…
This song is the s**t. A nod to Bowie in the best possible way.  They also could not have done any better matching the cinematography to the sound elements. Love these guys no matter what they do and can't wait to hear what's next on the horizon for Alex Turner.
🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
the fact that music like this is still being made in 2022 is what keeps me going
This is my 2nd comment on this video but I honestly think Alex turner is trolling with these shitty songs

Masterpiece
Y lo hicieron otra vez 😍😍🤣,  no pierden el toque, sin duda  es de las  mejores 🎆🎆
They are becoming so surrealistic and I absolutely love it.
this band is surreal  🤍🇧🇷
love this, but i wish his voice was deeper, i love when he sings with his deep calming voice, this one seems forced.
Suena nuevo, suena hecho por ellos, suena bueno. ¿Que más? Gracias.
Oh
👏👏👏👏👏
This has grown on me massively after a few listens - it’s screaming out to be used in a film. It could have fit well in ‘Don’t You Worry Darling’ had the timing been right.

Axel con una Les Paul!!!!
Hi veig la influència musical de David Bowie.
This is something I might slowly dance to while sipping on my fine sparkling water 💧
Really missed this side of the AM, excatly what I needed today. Thank you so much <3
ive never loved a song this much
मेरा YouTube chainal hi😂 😔Mere chainal se app ki helf ho sakti hi🥲 🥀मेरे चैनल से आप की helf हो सकती है 🌹 🥀Nice video 🌹
shit, i love you  ❤
ahhh its so perfect 💗💗💗💗💗
If they don't come to Texas for this new coming album I will cry myself to sleep
Tankyou:)
verdade amor,concordo. Tá lindo💕🐶🐶💗💗
Alex turner is so gifted! Always good to hear new things from him and the band 🤗
I hope the rest of the album is as good as their two singles, felt like that was my problem with their last album
Uffff ese piche guitarra al finaaalll
I actually love this song <333
so glad they stoped making indie rock, this is interesting at least
I AM VERY ENJOYING THE NEW SONG !!! I LOVE IT
Confirmado, The Strokes es mejor.
Tranquility base pit stop + race track
Perfeito.
Wow fantastic music!! ✨
masterpiece
O quanto eu amo essa banda não tá escríto! O fato deles adotarem um estilo diferente em todo album e não largarem sua identidade independente da crítica é algo admirável e dá espaço a obras de arte como essa música!
Amazing, deam
i love u guys sm ! <3
Their lyrics are like poems that need to be analyzed and put into context to be understood but when you do, you become totally obsessed! 🌹
Los amoooooo ❤❤
Beatles επιρροές ,μπραβο παιδιά !!!🇬🇷 ❤
Beatles επιρροές ,μπραβο παιδιά !!!🇬🇷 ❤
If that’s how our ancestors will see our generation i’m fine with that
What did you make me feel ?
YESSS
DIOS MIO LA VOZ DE ALEX ES TAN HERMOSA Y UNICA💗
La voz de Alex es literal una cobijita que me acobija 😭❤️
fácil uma das melhores que eles já lançaram, que coisa linda
🔥🔥🔥🔥
This music video and song are a total masterpiece 🥹 can I talk about the lyrics for a bit too? I grew up listening to AM and this album feels already so nostalgic, thank you for always delivering something wonderful without caring about judgement from others but simply doing what you want to do which is, in every case, the best music I’ve listened to! I love you AM ❤️
Old but Gold
Just wow ❤🔥🔥🫱🏾‍🫲🏽
this sounds like something the Beatles would’ve made
If you listen to The Last Shadow Puppets, then this album are in for a treats
Wow this is beautiful
This....just doesn't do it for me. It feels more like an Alex solo project than Arctic Monkeys. Same can be said for the last album.
Cada toma, cada compás y cada oración; todo se complementa para crear esta glamourosa pieza de arte  Gracias por existir arcticos monkos
Se os albúns Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino e o Suck It And See tivessem um filho seria o The Car
Si Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino y Suck It And See tuvieran un hijo, sería The Car
If Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino and Suck It And See had a child, it would be The Car
It sounds like arctic monkeys wants to be the beatles 2.0. From indie rock songs (I know, in beatles times there was no indie rock, but still, similar sound in some sort of way) to psychedelic ballads
Trying to be like Bowie, need to stop it immediately, absolute horse shit!!
There’s a Beatles vibe that I love it! Your music is helping me out through ups and downs, thanks Arctic Monkeys.
That combination is amazing! 2:28
1:40 Strawberry Fields Forever intro with the sudden chord change like A Day in the Life, in the style of Eleanor Rigby. Then becomes James Bond Skyfall orchestra theme when he is on the way to to Raoul Silvas' island. Awesome song
El sonido y la manera de interpretar me recuerdan mucho a the Beatles, se nota que tienen influencia a ellos, que temazo les quedó 😁🤘
Mais uma música sensacional <3
the "oohhh" gives me a jumpscare everytime 🤦
SO PREDICTABLE I KNOW WHAT YOURE THINKING
Lieder zur goldenen Hochzeit
devo ser verdadeira quando vi pensei que era ruim mais depois de escutar tudo que música o Alex realmente tem um talento de se expressar pelas músicas/letras e todos os meninos do am são tão melódicos sincronia perfeita parabéns a essa banda.
omg omg omg
arctic monkeys é minha cura
Outro álbum maravilhoso pra lista deles
These guys capture that 70-80s northern Britain working class aesthetic so perfectly
theory of sir paul mccartney is real 🤔
It could perfectly be a James Bond main theme.
He sounds like Robbie Williams here.
Very Bowie! 👨‍🎤
best song of 2022 hands down. im obsessed
Esse álbum é uma carta de amor ao rock ❤️🇧🇷
God, Arctic Monkeys aged so fine.
i'm a fan, my first arctic monkey's song is 'Dance Little Liar', i remember i listened to that when i'm junior hs, and that's still my fav song ever. Just saying the new album sounds so low ever since they're come back from hiatus, but i'm still listening into this new album, with a hope that theyll release something like 'Humbug' era
Omgggg❤❤❤

Лютейший фак 🚀
this is the good stuff
Amé esta canción. Que salga pronto el disco!! Es idea mía o la vela del principio es como igual a la del daydream nation?
Wasn’t a fan of mirrorball but this is an absolute banger
i love
1 million within 48 hours!
Whatever you think I am thats what I am not
That change around 1:40 reminds me of something else, anyone figured out what it is?
I did not expect to enjoy this as much as I did
Been a fan since their first albums and I feel so excited to know that their new music still resonates with me ! What a band ! Doing whatever they feel at the moment and still putting out amazing projects through sheer talent !

Cool to see Atic Minkeys back
This is a song of Arctic Monkeys or David Bowie? im confused
As retro as it can get 📺
there is something so magically and mysteriously haunting about this song that i can't explain- but i'm all in for it!
David Bowie would be proud
I LOVE YOU
♥️
arctic monkeys, una masssaa, pero a mi me gustan los temas mas power¡¡¡¡¡¡ rockkkkkkk
I love body paint so freaking much I love the music they make now ♥️
🤨
❤️😌
I think this album will be a little divisive when it drops but someday in the future will be loved by everyone.
I love
Gracias chicos por ser mi lugar seguro, jamás decepcionarme, siempre hacerme sentir mejor, en casa... Thanks for being my favourite band ever!!
heavenly ❤
I love this, I love his voice. I love every single song they’ve ever made.
The boys are getting older. And it breaks my heart. And makes me smile. Thanks Arctic Monkeys.
Yes, another shitty album.
I might be wrong, but I think Arctic Monkeys finally found the balance point between that dark romantic mood of AM and the glamorous kitsch vibe of Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino.
i was not expecting this 😧😧😧
Probably their most Bowie-esque song yet
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz 😴
3:35
Am I the only one that thinks this is shit and miss when AM used to play rock n roll?
BOWIEE VIBESSS
2:50
So much like a Beatle song omg
The song is amazing but the video i´ts just something else. The aesthetics are so cool
obsessed with the fact that every album of theirs is somewhat a different genre. patiently waiting for october 21st
Se siente mucho la influencia de el álbum blanco de The Beatles, está cool.
solid not good out of 10
Excelente canción, a partir del minuto 3:00 es cuando mejor se pone.
Mad props to the Arctic Monkeys for making these beautiful songs
I love you Alex Turner for you I made life want.
Es octubre!! A pocos días de escuchar el álbum completo!!!!!
LOS AMO <3
I love you so much

Anonadada, hermosa experiencia, adore que innovaran, que buen final, muy sensual, espero la toquen en concierto, eso seria increíble, me hacen recordar lo que es enamorarse de una canción, con ese toque juvenil aun después de años
Caralho os minutos finais são incríveis
Fumei um e to aqui brisando longe com esse vídeo,so cool.
🖤
This is so Queeneatlebowiestic and I LOVE IT!!!!!!
estuvo feo
I LOVE LOVE this song, everything about it!!
THAT WAS SO COOOOOLLLL
Long live Tranquility Base Part 2, death to AM-only lovers.
Well, I tried what I read the other day and it felt like the biggest relief of my life when I suddenly realized I was effortlessly flowing, it all started when something struck me after I go'ogled Beck Reznark's guide and now it's on demand for me lol
More like h(ar)d d(ic)k monkeys 🔥(missing letters: ct)
¡Que hermoso, directo al corazón y todo el poder de The Beatles!
😍
This is a fucking master piece
isso é perfeito, alex é realmente um artista de verdade

Sounds more like The Last Shadow Puppets than the Arctic Monkeys
Que coisa mais linda, realmente uma obra de arte  Tô maravilhada, minha bochecha está até doendo de tanto ficar sorrindo enquanto escuto 😭💖
aaa love this soo much
Los quiero mucho monos de la sierra nunca cambien 😭
quando vc acha que não pode melhorar, os cara lança essa obra prima
os cara não sabem fazer uma música ruim, por isso que eu amo essa banda
ALEX BRO PON EL TEMA EN X2 Y SE PONE MEJOR PARA SUBIRLO 😁✌
OE Y UN TEMA BUENO PA CUANDO?
Great
When the vocals are so good that you can't earnestly sing along
Marc Bolan that you?
Best.band.ever.
Simplemente, exquisito.
having affair vibes , alex ur so brilliant ;0
I love this!
تف على ravnzx
Pense que estaria mejor, creo que el album estara regular sinceramente
christ this is incredible
There is something very Bowie about this. I love it
Bertahap, dewasa dengan musik2 mereka. Keren sih.
Thank you for this choice of way to make music of this kind I love the old AM and the new AM exactly the same way if you like the real music like it is you will never judge them for that. This sound is so genuine and beautiful charming like a wave in the sea just follow the melody and sing everything flows through your soul the way you never thought.
It's been said before but the vibe of the lyrics feels very Submarine-esque while the music revisits THBAC and Last Shadow Puppets. I totally get what Alex says though where he feels he turned the fader up on the rock part of the song. Even the outro of the song gives AM-vibes. Very restrained execution here but the payoff so far has been great. A continuous evolution if there ever was one. Good one lads.
Turner dares like Mercury once did. <3
A evoluçao do Alex Turner é Incrível !
Beatles vibes are almost unbearable...love it!
Seems I’m the only one who doesn’t like it,, seems bland to me and a little bit boring,, but what do I know 😂
Foda, incrível demais!! Dá para sentir um pouco da essência de cada álbum, am nunca decepciona.
there’s so much to dissect in this video i love it
AM is another dimension!!!
the more I listen to it, the more I like it
.
😂
I can’t wait to this album  release!! Freakingggg
"so predictable" no. not at all.
I really miss the rock'n'roll bangers. Cant lie about that. Just cant like these new songs and thats alright, you do you
I still can’t believe this music exists.
Grandes monos articos ustedes no fallan🖤🖤🖤
just like the hotel & casino music... this would take some time before ppl like me to digest this kind of music before actually like it.
oh how i miss pre AM arctic monkeys....
Initially I was about to go onto tha next but the voice kept me here,  I like 👍 me likes it alot 💋 💋
I like it. And it will grow on me. However, it's more watered down from the Kings Theatre live version.
Next-level cinematography 🔥
i have never listened to a song on repeat as i have with this work of art. i know every lyric already
Anybody else catch the guitar solo riff 4:09 “Arabella”
thank you for the vibe
When happens when an artist has full control and do what they want. This album is going to be incredible judging by what we already have
Artic Monkeys haciendo arte, como siempre.
SO UNDERRATED PLEASE
ARARARARARARARARARARA
en efecto, esto es arte
tbhc 2
MAGRITTE
Parece que esses caras não sabem como fazer música ruim, uma banda que sempre se supera e inova a cada disco.
THIS IS AMAZING !!!
Son geniales ,lo mas curioso es que empiezan como si fueran comerciales de alguna marca de colonia francesa o italiana y luego se van rockeando en el camino
I always enjoyed your music! But maybe you could wanna know: younger peoples ( like my teenager daughter, just started to get in love with your music this last months ( une mode en France et Europe) bad look because this last singles are fuuucking Bad! So if you wanna know: get back, know, to the Arctic monkeys beautiful sound...
Arctic Monkeys, thank you for existing! I'm in love with absolutely everything you do ❤️
I hate this new style its poo
estoy enamorada dios
The music is arranged so well ❤️
somehow they remind me of the beatles. can write and sing songs just about anything and the songs still becomes extraordinarily good. artists these days sings only about love or sex or breakup or profanity or anything else dirty to stay relevant it sounds boring already and desperate
cant wait to see them in november!!!!
Perfect.
Buenísima👍 ...con un buen ingrediente de Bowie?? Genial. 👍👍🇨🇱
Such beautiful photography
Increible evolucion de Arctic monkeys ❤
¡Qué buena canción, Dios! Me dan ganas de escucharla todo el tiempo.
0:41 iggy!!!!!!!!
ONE WORD: AMAZING 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Te amo Arctic Monkeys, pinche canción espectacular que hiciste
Gracias Alex Turner por darme ganas de vivir
What the actual fuck Okay.
Esa banda cada vez es más grande,toda su música es fascinante pues sabe cautivar el oído de cualquier persona y enamorar el corazón,los amo AM por hacer feliz mi vida con su música 🖤
Jadooore
No me arrepiento de haberlos conocido❤
This song Is beautiful ✨
I love this!!!!!
This sounds a lot like David Bowie especially towards the end.
The best thing about them is they didn't turn into Coldplay.
Senti uma pegada de Beatles nessa musica... coisa linda
Este es el celular de mi hija😪lo uso muy poco,estoy escuchando su musica. Ahora esta en el cielo mi Nickyta😢te extraño mucho❤👩‍🎓
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
esto es fantástico 😎👌
what kind of "revolver" is this album?
Like por lo monos en Argentina
you are so fricking cool!!!!
cómo me tatúo un video y una canción?
Masterpiece
Holy shit this music video may be one of their best
Fan
❤
q buena canción dios, los amoo
it doesn’t matter what vibe have arctic monkeys, because it will be always hot
i love it
Lo que disfruté escuchar esta canción! Me gustaa 👏👏👏
Alex has a new guitar
<3
QUE DELÍCIA
Music is all about personal taste and I loved the first 3 albums and odd songs from albums after that but I can't get away with new sound it's not why I got I to them and it's just not for me now. But if people like this fair play it's for them but for me I loved the old style and this is to far removed now it's like elevator music , but like I said that's my opinion and my taste .
First time listening: Oh no.. Second time listen: Yes. Yes. Yes!!
اليكسس 😩🔥
Funny how Jamie is playing a Gibson Firebird in this video. A guitar literally made by a CAR designer to resemble a 50s style automobile. So he's playing a CAR inspired guitar in the band's new album titled "The Car". Layers upon layers, man
Los mejores por lejos sin discusión
Los mejores por lejos sin discusión
their music videos are pure art.
This album is gonna be so bloody amazing
Its giving bowie and i love it
Simplemente perfectos. Son los unicos en mi vida que me llegan al corazón <3
reviveu?
Pfff 1018 again?????
Cant wait for this new album coming!!
I'm glad Richard Hammond left the top gear band and joined the arctic monkeys they sound way better.
OMG! They sound so new but still totally them, I'm hyped!
0:52 alex looks like xqc here
Alex slowly turning his voice into John Lennon
It's not a blasphemy to say Alex is clearly sounding like John Lennon here.
Yes please.
Really hate the vocals
bro orb
perfeito, apenas
I love you, never go away
Gracias por darme la bocanada en medio de tanta asfixia "musical". La belleza de ese video junto a esa canción es el arte que nos dice que sigue viviendo.
Everything we need in a song
Me encanta la evolución que han tenido 🥺
ª 4:00
thank you since my teenage years
This is Cinema
😍😍
i love you guys, thanks for keep doing these incredible songs that get me in the vibe
I love it
No se pero quiero llorar por esta joya
Put it on repeat
Bendición total para mis oídos 😻🙏
Truly a blockbuster song.. A star treatment for the moment
шикарно,одним словом просто восхитительно..
My favorite band ❤️❤️❤️❤️🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
this is like radiohead
👏👏👏
Great video, mediocre song, such a shame.
MASTERPIECE <33
Wow
Eu Apenas Quero Ser Seu Arctic Monkeys
“if your thinking of me then i’m probably thinking of you” y’all get it
y’all are killing it
Love them
of all honesty, this song sounds like something out of a commercial
Nunca decepciona ❤
What an absolute Sheffield songwriting treasure Alex Turner is.  Alex gives us a real sense of place through his lyrics whilst the band constantly surprise us musically.  Domino Recording Company have allowed the Arctic Monkeys so much creative freedom over the years when any other label would have pressured the band to repeat themselves instead of evolving.
i listen to these fuckers since I was a Little kid, and they've been maturing just like me, it's insane how I still fuck with them after all those years, thanks
Awesome, as is mirrorball. This album might be better than Tranquility and that’s saying something!!!
THERES STILL A TRACE OF BODY PAINT ON YOUR LEGS AND ON YOUR ARMS AND ON YOUR FACE
Most everyone hated Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino because they wanted AM pt. 2. They don't understand that we may never get an AM pt. 2 because bands grow and change. Don't make that same mistake with this album.
he articulates very well 😭
sad this only has a milly views
Show
It's going to take a few decades to fully chart how good this music is historically. IMO a modern day Beatles. Very grateful.
Es una obra de arte<3
Wouldn’t call it a masterpiece but the new songs are totally different and get better the more you listen. I wasn’t keen at first but I think both songs are great now. I look forward to the new album and thank god you’re touring back at the UK. See you in Bristol AM👍
Literal llevo escuchándola 2 días
MEUS AMORES VOLTARAM🤧😭
What a load of pretentious shite. Remember how good Arctic Monkeys used to be. This is the emperor's new clothes, there's nothing there.
Componete un rockandroll Alejandro
i like this but all bands seem to revert back to the beatles 😀
This album should be called 'PERFECT TIMING'. Been so busy with life, it's good to know my favorite band of all time is back with good music to relax my mind! AM forever even in the PM!!!!!!
❤️
I see david bowie's influence
🖼️
Perfect beach https://youtube.com/shorts/svNRnkW76sg?feature=share
not even a day and i already addicted to this song.
Eu já vi esse clipe umas 20 vezes, sem meme.
Love these MF’s
I love the fact that with this song you can see how they make what they love in their way!!!!
Arctic Monkeys makes songs for filmmakers
Was sure this was David Bowie, sounds so alike.
😍😍😍😍😍
This must have been what it was like listening to rubber soul for the first time after having grown up listening to a hard days night
Tiene vibras del Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino
It's an incredible song, i loved it
So glad this is closer to TBHC than AM. They have carved out an awesome sound for themselves. Thank you guys for sharing your talent and passion with us all once more!
Submarine 2 soundtrack.
is that alex using a firebird? hypeeeeeee
THIS IS MUSIC
I can't stand how much I love this song.
Beatles era boys
In love<3
Show (⁠♡⁠ω⁠♡⁠ ⁠)⁠ ⁠~⁠♪
Indonesia hadir!!!!
this sucks
It’s like if Stanley Kubrick and Wes Anderson had a baby
omggg, que bonito es todo :DD
best band right now. try to convince me otherwise
TBH, I pretty like this song, but I somehow can't get used to Alex singing nearly permanently high, okay let me say half of it
What the hell happened to this band? Does he think he is Bowie or something? This is shit
wow😍
David Bowie vibes
good
So good
pure art
Good but it's not Arctic Monkeys
i am in love
So gentle. It is a pure cure for body and soul.
I pray whoever eyes catch this comment god gives you the strength you need to over come every battle your facing. May the dark thoughts and overthinking, the doubts exit your mind right now. May replace confusion. May peace and calmness fill in your life. ❤️😊
Feels like I'm in a lift with the Don
Such a class act monkeys
I can only describe this as gorgeous, fuck me sideways!!
1:11 René Magritte reference ? This whole video does feel surreal
It's like fine wine
What a song 😍
I just started crying to this it’s so perfect
It’s like this masterpiece had been directed by Alejandro Jodorowsky and produced by Rene Magritte with Arctic Monkeys as lead soundtrack
Huge, gigantic, unavoidable vibes of Submarine
Very Bowie
Nice
Quando você acha que não pode melhorar eles lançam uma obra prima 🛐💕
They're gradually transitioning to a Wes Anderson-esque aesthetic
go on the lads
AH!
This is pure art. I remember doing a chart show when their "I bet you look good on the dance floor" stole the top spot and here I am, years later, still worshipping them regardless what music they make. Artists are allowed to evolve and to absolutely do what's right for them. Just wonder, Matt is such a heavy drums banger, if it could get boring for him drumming in slow modus. I'd love anyone doing interviews with AM asking him this. Simply love them! My band. #ស្វាត្រជាក់forever 💓
David Bowie could be singing this 🎙
It reminds me of Aerosmith and other 70s rock bands
LOS AMOOO SON EL AMOR DE MI VIDAAAAA😻💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
Good to see them back
Idk, it's giving David Bowie and I love it>>
Really excited for the album now.
Huhuhuhu
omg
yo quiero mucho a los arctic monkeys
OMG why are ya so unique! 😭
this is cinema
Getting queen vibes here
If Queen and Elton John had a child !
Such a sad and beautiful song
🤮🤮
😎
It sounds good

whaaaat a vibe ❤
So So Predictable. The man with the cone on his head said to the ice cube.
Amazing<33
Didn't know what to make of it, but it's now my favorite Monkey's song since AM.
Melancolia pura y paz inmensa!

Tranquility Base is a top 10 album for me personally so them exploring a lounge sound still is making me have extremely high hopes. These 2 singles are making me too excited for the record
cuando concierto en ecuador?
i love arctic monkeys
ugh
I love Arctic Monkeys
me encantaia ver esta locura en vivo, TE ODIO OCESA
This sounds like it could of been from the last album, has a very similar sound.
take a look there https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chgMoaqiQc8
Alex's voice is getting better with time, just like wine and now I'm happily drunk.
mon copain
🐒🐵
this is a cinematic masterpiece
i'm a fan from 1st album, but the last album and now these new 2 songs, well personally i don't like it and won't bother listening to the album.
So glad this dropped on my birthday! This one is so fucking good.
This song right here isn’t for everyone, but I reckon it’s beautiful af
HERMOSO
👩‍🦯👩‍🦯
Joder esto si es música
This feel like watching a movie
This is seriously one of the best music video I have ever seen. Brilliant cinematography and aesthetics, magically alluring song, beautiful vocals, this is what Arctic Monkeys is.
No sé por qué pero siendo la primera vez que la escucho, sentí una tristeza enorme:( (que buena canción)
Niceeeeeeee!!!!!
They always hit
masterpiece
😴 Wake me up when September ends
Awesome 😍
Seen a few very bitter/salty comments. People just can’t stop banging that drum about how different they are, musically and Stylistically. It’s common knowledge they’ve taken a different path, TBHC making that blatantly apparent. So what exactly were these “fans” hoping for? Another AM or FWN? I liken it to buying a cheeseburger and wondering why it isn’t chicken burger when you receive your order.   Finally, I’d like to say, I feel blessed to be hearing/witnessing this new direction and era. They’ve matured and are making music that stimulates them. That’s all you can do in life, go with your gut and your heart. ✌🏻
Masterpiece
this is the goated era right here
I love it♡
Que gran cancion!🥰
I feel David Bowie in this song
awesome, Alex is so hot!, omg la calidad de planos y fotografías que presenta este corto musical me deleitó durante los 4:36 min. de esta pieza artística, alguien sabe dónde puedo conseguir este demo en vinilo acá en Talca of Chile?. Saludos Alexis Turner from Chilean.
TE AMO BANDA EXPECTACULAR❤️

My god this man is still the sexiest man to walk the earth
David Bowie, is that you?
Amazing.
mandaram bem mores parabens
I saw them perform at Life Is Beautiful, they were incredible. I cannot wait for their new album
Enak, gabisa nikmatin tapi
3:37 nice nod to Bowie
M ENCANTA
Their new songs have made me feel things that music has not made me felt in a really long time. Love love this new music.
Wow this is amazing. I love the new sound. Much more upbeat and rockier than Tranquility
Bowie?
que es esooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Belleza de canción
Fuerte influencia de The Beatles, por tanto, perfecta 👌
YAY NEW SONG
Brilliant song, sounds like Beatles + Bowie combination
wow
Unreal song, sounds similar to the Beatles and David Bowie era
Joder como los amo :'v
totalmente enamorada de esta canción
q maravilloso es la voz de este hombre y espectacular la banda
Anyone else gettin Bowie vibes. Brilliant fellas!
https://youtu.be/WE6KHAv-p6k
El arte visual es tan exquisito, al igual que los sonidos y la voz de Alex. Este nuevo estilo es curioso, interesante e innovado en AM. ME ENCANTA!! No puedo esperar a escuchar el álbum completo. El sentimiento es real.
Unpopular opinion and very controversial but I miss the old AM those were absolute BANGERRRSSS Makes your body want to move
Quand tu mets J’aime dès le début en n’ayant entendu que qqs notes! ✨❤️🏴‍☠️
the monkeys are back!!! :D
This is a masterpiece
Mis ganas de vivir regresaron gracias a está canción
Nah nah gente ARTE
this is GOOOOOOOD
Crazy to think i'v been watching these dude's grow for the last 20 years now- this is some kinda of coup de grace to the last two decades with this insane Bowie/Beatles Twist that Alex embodies so well. Up the Albion. Thank fuck for real music.

LOS AMO MUCHO 😭💗
yayyy, my favourite band
The aesthetic of the video is the one I want in my life
This is a musical autists wet dream
I just do not know why I cannot relate to this track. I think I need to listen to it on repeat. It is great for a band to evolve and I appreciate it, but to me the first 3 albums are gold
You guys are genious, i love it😍
Good sample of David Bowie Moonage Daydream on the final whit the guitar 😉😏 i love that ❤️‍🩹💯
Genial!!
ficou boa pra caralho
I could watch this over and over and over and over Beautiful song just perfect chiefs kiss!
OMGG, Like all the songs I LOVEEE IT 💘💘
I’m sorry it totally could have been “body paint on your legs and on your waist…” having said that I’m gonna play this on repeat for the next four years till next album.
this was so boring
ilysm alex ❤️
SOY TAN FELIZ CON SU MUSICA, ORGULLOSA DE AMARLOS DESDE LOS 5😭😭😭💖💖💖
I'm just happy there is another album 💀
This sounds like shine on you crazy diamond
This songs growing on me,I hear something new each time I listen,and the videos are amazing a late.👍
:)
Oi brasil, alguém quer trocar uma ideia musicalmente sobre essa música aí?
More pretentious drivel, what the fuck happened to you?
A cara de doido não muda 🖤
listened to this in the rain today and it was just perfect 🥰
DIOOOSSSS
1:40 sounds like the beginning of a musical
Reminds me some of Bowie sounds. Really nice. Love them forever.
It's like seeing a Wes Anderson's movie
That's elegant
Evolusi yang berulang2 dengan luar biasanya lagu ini
he is continuing in the mood of Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino, an intellectual a little too pushy for him
Orgasmo em forma de música.
alex te amo <3
Genuinely dont know if I like this or not
That intro is mesmerizing, reminds me of some tunes from Hugo
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💞💞💞
wtf this is perfect
❤
4:00 Me when my mom beats my sister
gostei da música, ela me lembra uma mistura de elton john e mais algo que não consigo lembrar
that's beautiful, no better word to describe the voice the guitar the bass the drums cinematography every minor detail is synonymous to perfection
Idk if it’s because I recently started watching Breaking Bad, but I’m seeing some Breaking Bad references throughout this album and  in this music video (specifically at 0:28) and song titles like “Mr. Schwartz.” Alex is a known fan of Breaking Bad so it’s a possibility
take me to meadowhall!!!!
Arctic monkeys, mi vida
I have such conflicting feelings. Love both songs so far, but pretty disappointed in the direction they'e gone after 5 years+ of new Alex in any form. Feels so weird, but at least the music is pretty good.

i’m crying...  its perfect  so cool!💐
1:44 like Queen
BEWARE OF GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT IN ORGANIZED HARASSMENT
It's incredible how The Beatles transcend into every band for generations and generations.
Very Dry Bowie-esque. Loved the ending.
Arctic Monkeys never Die.. this is amazing!

Love the 2nd half of this song after the breakdown!   Can't help but think Matt Helders' drumming is wasted on this style of song though since the tempo is more on the slow side haha
Buena rola
My word  The video, the song, everything 🔥
nono para
david tennant got a new job
Getting David Bowie and Wes Anderson vibes.
I've got answers to all my questions
Literal chills when I heard it come out

1st listen not so sure, 2nd listen the panther fuckin LOVES IT!! 🐅
The most fulfilling and warm single the Monkey's have released, a masterpiece.
sei la, nao gostei. tem como voltar a vibe antiga?
Sound heavenly bowieish, love it
the cinematic are beautiful
Uuhhhhhhhh Raaaahhhhhh
Que buena rolaaaa
so beautiful
We had the Beatles, then came the AMs. This video is a masterpiece.
es como si semisonic hubiese renacido ❤❤❤
Im not gay, im alexsexual
Antes del millón 😸
This is sublime 👌
oh my god I LOVE THIS
TE AMO ALEX, TE AMO ARCTIC MONKEYS
É A DÉCIMA PRIMEIRA VEZ QUE ESTOU ESCUTANDO ESSA MÚSICA, ARCTIC MONKEYS VOCÊS QUEREM ME MATAR?
Very English and very Beatles
Increíble.... sin dudas los AMS de superan cada vez y me gusta que hagan canciones acorde a lo que ellos quieran enseñar  y no lo que el publico quiere escuchar
It's the kind of music you listen to when you're alone. It becomes your only friend and remains a secret forever.
This was an unexpected pleasant surprise :)
0:12 cornestone?
People think they were gonna stay doing garage rock forever?? c'mon, 36/37 years old guys won't be doing songs like a certain romance or teddy picker, they are growing and doing what they want, if u don't like it okay but don't come here throwing up shit, the song is amazing and it's a song difficult to understand but no they won't do an album like fwn or AM again because they are not doing the same all over again, this doesn't sound like tbhc in my opinion, i think it's very good and also it's good the fact that they keep on evolution as a band
It sound like Beatles
It's that time of the year when i enjoy new music from 2 of my favourite bands interpol and arctic monkeys.
the reason why i love arctic monkeys is that every album is different from the other and they are all amazing. This song is just incredibile.
first in 'there would better be a mirrorball' Alex turner is breaking up with a lover now suddenly he breaks up with a cheater.. impressive! the whole album might be all about exe's probably.
🥵🥵🥵
this song just relaxing to me
dinlemeden like attım  edit: dinlemeden like atanlar beğensin edit2: sayımızı görelim edit3: 2022de görenler
The video is the best i've seen in a long while. Blew my mind. It goes so smoothly with the song. Brilliant.  Just enhances the experience instead of becoming a distraction.
the last shadowww
Thank you 🥺🖤
Yeah this ain't it chief
I was 19 years old in 2005 and from sheffield when whatever people say came out it will always be my favourite album of theirs but I like the others just not as much the arctic monkeys are still an awesome band
shouldn't be allowed to be a band anymore. illegal. boo.
I’m getting a kind of Flight Of The Conchords, Bowie feel from this….and it’s not a bad thing 🙂
it looks straight outta Submarine movie. perfect
This reminds me more of Alex's other band, forgot it's name 🥺 Doesn't sound lie the Monkey's I used to listen to. Feel kinda guilty since everyone in the comments is so positive
How it is going, Artic Monkeys? Yes. No. Ha!
Isso é totalmente Beatles
los amo con todo mi ser son los mejores😿💗
This is a work of art. Loved every second of it. amazing
Ewk
omgggggg, i love them
:o
3:01 Vintage Slingerland (marching?) tom! The imagery is so mint. Love the emphasis on film. As for the music, continuing on the current path of heavy production, tons of instruments, no multiple movements in each song is fantastic.
The Beatles are heavy in this one
🚨Who ever reads this will have a good weekend interact 3x to clam 🚨
Alex represents the sex itself
Obra maestra 💗💗💗💗💕
“ and im keeping on my costume” “OOO” scared the shit out of me
maybe i should order the car eh? what they put out so far has been really good
😻😻😻
Instantly press like
padrísimo
I hope these singles are the worst tracks off the record, because they're fucking amazing
I like this, hopefully I can dig at least 6 or more songs on the upcoming album.
Their best song.    Yep I mean it.  This is superb music from the only important rock band left.
❤
Am I the only one who startled like cat at 2:16 ??? Cause of the backing voice
É só eu ou o Alex tá tocando a mesma les paul do Slash
belleza
2:28 melhor parte da música ❤️❤️🛐
This is what your Grandparents should have had.Enjoy.
Great Song 👏
What an absolute Sheffield songwriting treasure Alex Turner is.  Alex gives us a real sense of place through his lyrics whilst the band constantly surprise us musically.  Domino Recording Company have allowed the Arctic Monkeys so much creative freedom over the years when any other label would have pressured the band to repeat themselves instead of evolving.
Trotz Kanalsperre YouTube wieder der selbe Müll 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
Obsessed. Always will be. SO grateful to have grown up alongside this evolution 🙌
Une voix si huuuummm une mélodie parfaite tous les ingrédients pour me laisser aller à ma mélancolie douce ♥️ Merci de ça !!
So good! Reminded me of Miles Kane see ya when I see ya 👀
John Lennon is alive and kicking in this song and it's fantastic!
I looooooooooooooooovee Alex 💯💯🥰
Que ganas de volver al 2006 con sonidos hermosos como when the sun goes down o red light o dancing shoes
Que lastima que ya no sea una banda de rock 😐🖓
I love
AHHHHHHHHHHH QUE HERMOSAS MELODÍAS!!!! ✨
I leave my heart here... ♥️
Arctic monkeys>>>
Beatles vibes when the strings kick in
DIOS QUE HOMBRES
song is cool only with the video
Incredibly boring, unoriginal and uninteresting.
OMGGG
Ugh more of this sound
Alex❤ I really want to watch ur gigs in Bali!
My new favorite song by them
Succulent
One of the best things about dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieves something. He always respect us, the audience, and his team, and he is always polite in all of his videos. We congratulate ourselves on this achievement. More to come and everything to come.
pleasure to listen.
Alex Turner's stay-at-home pastimes, in order of appearance:  * Vintage cinéma masterclasses * Listening to Sonic Youth * Rewatching cinéma classics * Driving license theory education * Snooker  * Sunbeds * Naruto * Tarot (and smoking) * Video art * Rehearsing (or microphone dancing) * Rifle lessons (or balloon hunting) * Reenacting cinéma classics * Booze * Crop circles (adjusted for English climate) * Fashion maintenance * Helicopter classes * Conceptual art

Boring.
this is stunning, wonderfull, amazing
damm what a great song
This is a masterpiece, can someone please explain which type of cinematography style he is using for this video??
This is a leftover art.
I love you daddy
btw do u guys know that u are popular outside of the US and EU and AUS? just wondering 🥲 please come to asia one day
Dont worry guys, if people dont like this song now, they will like it 10 years later and it will be trending :)
Ya dejen de mamar... Esto está de hueva, pensé que TBHC era un capricho de Turner que quería cumplir, pero seguir sacando música de elevador para este nuevo album está de hueva. Y ni empiecen a mamar porque soy fan de AM desde antes de Suck it and see. Dejen de mamar con que "esto es el rock que necesitamos" no es cierto,  esto es música ambiental, música que ponen en una peluquería, música replicada de los 50's 60's, dejen de querer hacerse los interesantes diciendo que esto es una "obra maestra que nadie entiende". Acuérdense que están defendiendo a la banda más mainstream "rockera" junto con the Strokes que existe jaja pa que dejen de sentirse "únicos" que saben apreciar de "buena" música
Every now and then there are music pioneers that introduce new and beautiful sounds to the industry--Queen, The Beatles, ELO, Bowie. I see Turner fashioning himself after these legends.
i miss the old Arctic Monkeys... ☹
I really love these guys 🥰😮‍💨
Absolutely love this song! Can't stop listening to it. I now have really high expectations for the album.
Classic monkeys riffs at the end. Cant wait for the new album 💪
I love this new style/feel. It's so nice. And the violins?? Plsssss
Never dissapoint... this made me drop a tear too..
La famine et la guerre sur le point d'arrivée en Europe, de Poutine viendra le chaos et ils complet bientôt cette paroles (il y aura de grands tremblements de terre, et, en divers lieux, des pestes et des famines; il y aura des phénomènes terribles, et de grands signes dans le ciel. LUC 21:11), seul le Nom de Jésus-Christ sauve Rom 10.13 "Car quiconque invoquera le nom du Seigneur sera sauvé". Dieu vous aime, il vous aime tellement, et il a payer un prix très très grand pour vous, il vous a donné la vie et tout ce quelle renferme, chercher le de la manière que vous le souhaitée, parler lui il vous donneras, chercher le vous le trouverez, demandez et il vous donneras, il a donné son fils unique Jésus Christ en sacrifice pour que vous accéder a sa présence (Jean 14.16) et il ne souhaite que vous rencontre, il vous connait et il sait qui vous étiez, il est avec vous pour l'éternité, vous serait le plus heureux du monde si vous trouvé Dieu dans votre vie, je souhaite vraiment que vous le découvrir et qu'il comble votre cœur tout entier, par son unique Fils Jésus-Christ, mort pour nous, que l'amour de Dieu vous inonde, et il ne veux que personne périssent dans son péché, sa désobéissances envers Dieu car cela vous fera porter la peines de vos crimes devant Dieu alors que Jésus-Christ a porter toute la peines de toutes vos faute Passer, Présent et Futur, car son sang innocent verser par les hommes a effacée pour nous ABSOLUMENT TOUTES FAUTE, et si vous n'avez pas crue et accepter ce pardon donné gratuitement a tous, alors la colère de Dieu vous sera remis a la fin de votre vie et vous aurez pour salaire, le rejet de Dieu et de son royaume pour l'éternité et vous n'aurez plus de par a la vie dans l'au delà car votre esprit ne sera pas bon a cause de toute vos faute commise sur terre, elle régiront et vous serait souillée et en horreur a Dieu, et ce, peut importe vos faute, ne vous y trompé pas Dieu existe et toute c'est œuvre son visible sur terre (la justice, l'amour, la paix, le plaisir, et la création, etc...). Si vous avez compris ce message, demander a Dieu de vous sortir du pécher dans le quel vous êtes (la convoitise, le sexe hors mariage, l'impudicité (les habille serrer et manque de pudeur ...), le vole, la violence, la haine, l'amour du monde, l'ignorance de Dieu, l’avortement, les idolâtres de marie mère de jésus, les faux Dieu, et d'autre ...), il vous pardonnera de tout péché si vous le lui confesser. Dieu à laisser ses paroles dans la Bible et tout ce qui est de Dieu est écrit dedans. SEUL le Nom de son Fils qui a fait faire mourir sur terre, que Dieu ce révèle a vous et que vous puissiez recevoir son Salut gratuit et éternel, et contempler avec tout ca l’Amour que Dieu a pour le monde entier. Que Dieu ce révèle à vous, dans le Nom de Jésus-Christ notre Sauveur et Seigneur.........
A VOZ DO ALEX TÁ PERFEITA PQP✨❤✨
I really cannot stop replaying this song
everyone pretending to like it XD
welcome to jazz club
the lads are back <333333
nope. this new style doesn't have that bite I got from previous albums. I like the video clip tho
Tlsp and tbhc bangers, we're going to own The Car album, better get ready
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA pq
First time : Alex Turner and Gibson Les paul classic
No es arctic monkeys
Ok pero las guitarras del final✨🫶🏻
Te amo Alex turner
Ooowwwww 😍😍💖
saudades arct monkeys rock
Oh my god, as expected, good song
Muy beatle!! me encantó.
Directed by Stanley Kubrick
ainda não me acostumei q eles finalmente lembraram q tem uma banda 😍
THIS IS MASTERPIECE AND GONNA BE MY 1 ST SONG THIS YEAR
I love it!!! I love his voice so much!!! He could sing any words with that voice and have my attention!!! The whole band is just absolutely  bloody amazing!!!
TE AMO ALEX
Matt must be so bored as a drummer.
💖💖💖
I love u guys 💖
💗💗💗
The song is fine, probably wouldn't go out of my way to listen again, tbh.  I do miss the energy from the earlier albums, still play those jams on the regular.
te amo loco, mil años d vida para alex
💕💕💕💕💕💕
tiene una mística de los beatles esta canción
https://youtu.be/s0FfXo0VVgg🔥
Fantastic , channeling Bowie ! :)
Every single frame here is a work of art.
Very bowie-esque
Incredible 🙌
Gotta say, really really love this song. And AM music videos are always fantastic (some of my favorites) but this one really takes the cake, absolutely superb.
🤍
Perfect.
Foda pra kct!
macacos árticos
Te amo Arctic Monkeys ❤️
Taylor left him with a heavy heart.
💞
Boring song
I really hate this new stuff but the ballroom grew on me
All their music sounds the same, this song makes me want to sleep, teenagers only like them because they are a trend
Each new release of Arctic Monkeys makes me think "oooh i don't know if i'm gonna enjoy this one". And in the end, I love it. Masters of music.
Omg el ritmo de esta cancion!!!!!
I just cant get over it
We want the old Arctic Monkeys back from the album AM
All I saw in the comments is about Alex. I know he's super duper great, but can we all acknowledge the band as a whole? They all are undeniably amazing, and that's a fact!
love u guys so much. loving this new era. so beautiful
Christ…I didn’t think it could get any better than TBH+C..what a fool I was.
I like how David bowie/pink flode type of style is coming out
That rock'n'roll, eh? That rock'n'roll just won't go away...
This really does feel more and more like a magnum opus album from Alex Turner. Nothing is frilly, every single sound has a purpose. TBHC tested the waters, and The Car seems poised to top a lot of year end lists. He started out as a musician and has evolved into an artist. Masterful.
zzzzz
omg I'm obsessed with this video!! I just love this film style so much, the shots are absolutely gorgeous and it fits this AM era so well
Tá lindo amores 😭🌷
it's the way the sound of it (not structurally) sounds so 'arctic monkeys'. their essence is all over this.
fuckk it's comiinggg
Stuck on the puzzle + one point perspective.
They are more reminiscent of The Last Shadow Puppets than Arctic Monkeys
perfect
LOL, watching how I blasted all over the "place" in less than a month was shocking, I used what I talked about the other day, and although it actually took about 5 weeks for my volume to double, I just go'ogled Jan Venstaker's Shooting Ropes and her reaction has been priceless!
very nice song
Una obra maestra 🔥
Some crazy chord changes. Beatles esk
OHMYGOD THIS IS EVERYTHING THE CINEMATOGRAPHY???????? SO GOOD
MI NUEVA OBSESIÓN <3
💗💗💗💗💗
La canción se trató de Alex literal. Todo se enfoco en su voz. Solo en la outro empezaron a participar los demás. Siento que Arctic Monkeys se está convirtiendo en un TLSP para Alex.
🥺yo los amoo
One of wankest songs I've ever heard
So so so shit
I really didnt feel like this was Alex's best vocal performance :x
This song it's just PERFECT 💓
Alex really took 'Whatever people say I am that's what I'm not' seriously
They truly are a work of art. Slowly rotating as artifacts in museums
Gracias chicos por ser mi lugar seguro, jamás decepcionarme, siempre hacerme sentir mejor, en casa... Thanks for being my favourite band ever!! 💯
The melody sounds like a Submarine 🥺
Aburrido
Alex hablando de sexo con palabras que no tienen que ver nada con el sexo, pero te dan la connotación de que habla de sexo jajaj
Utter bollocks
OOOOOOOOMYYYYYGODDDDDDD

Los amo articos monos, su canción, su escencia, la voz de Alex Turner me encanta siempre mágica, los integrantes cada uno talentoso, simplemente artístico
I sadly find Alex's vocals to be terrible on this one :(
❤❤❤❤
MEU SENHOR AMO ESSES
I love the aesthetic of his music since tranquility base omg
A VOZZZZZZ
Richard Hammond's looking well
Oh boy, this does kind of make me feel maybe the artist is a little sick of the audience.  Just a vibe, but it could be anything else
Almost like a cross between bowie & beatles 🤔
❤️
sí es música fregado
1:29 Wait, are these flashes of text the names of the songs on the album!?
Magnífica 💖✨✨

i love you guys
This song makes me wanna pretend like a Gangster taking over the world.
Wild how the Arctic Monkeys still sounds like the Arctic Monkeys after god knows how many years. I appreciate it.
I love the aesthetic of the video so much. It seems really deep
Oh mY GOOOOOODDDDDD
Alex Turner 🖤🤎 mükemmel perceft
Aaaaaa es demasiado Sexoooo🎸
😍 I’m in love
Absolute garbage. Wtf has happened to AM. All they do is release fucking elevator music now
This record is just getting better and better!!
soy adicta a esta canción dios
It's almost like they're a brand new band... but not, it's fantastic
Thank you Monkeys, very cool.
Mi existencia<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<SU CANCIÓN
From my heart, for the artic monkeys  ...  Thanks for coming back for us, I'm glad of your evolution, save our generation :)
Anyone could explain the lyrics to me?    I'm guessing   1) Body Paint = She's a clown?  (As an insult) and also since the "And I'm keeping on my costume" implying he's also a clown since she's cheating on him.  Actually the body paint/costume probably referring to a car workshop?  Like she went to another car workshop(cheating place) when she used to only visit his and he could see the body paint on her face, arms etc. hence the keeping on the costume, so the costume could be the writing tool since she still has body paint on her and it'll be on his workshop costume outfit?    Or like  2) Figuratively, she's cheating on him and the "body paint" are like traces of the person she's cheating with?
😻😻😻😻
💗💗💗💗💗
Si no me suicido es para escuchar esta canción
Mi vida es asquerosa pero su canción es mucho mejor que mi vida
I didn't expect that song will make me a goosebumps! I love it! ❤❤❤
Lo mejor
💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Me encanta
1:15 Paul McCartney's Yesterday vibes, great strings section
💗💗💗
Está muy perfecto
Alex Turner amo tu voz
Pasan muchas cosas en la está canción
Joyaaa
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=A0YwjrA5zlE
IMPECÁVEL é a melhor palavra que tenho para descrever o que é esse vídeo
Es una de las mejores canciones que escuche en años realmente la mezcla perfecta de todo lo que esta bien
LOVE IT
absolutely incredible.
Sounds like Robbie Williams
Wew
THIS SONG IS JUST
❤
Lo único que no me gusta es cuando se acaba canción. Aún en mi cabeza permanece, que maravillosa y relajante voz 💜
rock is dead
I feel so calm while listening🫶🏼
EU NÃO TO ACREDITANDO MEU DEUS EU TO CHORANDO
Brillando como siempre ✨😍
Se eu soubesse que tinha lançado ontem, tinha escutado esse hino juntinho dela...
Love u❤
Los quiero mucho Monos Serranos <3
so much Bowie in here...
que locura
Finally a song me and my mom, both , can enjoy . It is such a challenge to find one we can listen happily , the last was Salvatore by lana del Rey .
Em algumas partes a música me lembra levemente e meio que inconscientemente "stuck on the pluze" e algum ponto de "she's thunderstorms ", já de cara já percebo que terá aqueles que não irão se dar bem com a música, eu na primeira vez estranhei um pouco por ser algo novo, mas agora algumas horas depois essa música não saí da minha mente, ótimo trabalho, o vocal do Alex está perfeito.
such beautiful photography
nah this is too goooood
I want to take my place for 2024 listeners.
Just me that’s getting Queen vibes? Like that 70s rock ish
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=A0YwjrA5zlE
Não é possivel, essa música é uma obra de arte. já é uma das minhas favoritas do arctic monkeys com toda a certeza do mundo
This is perfection
bit of ELO in that middle section
THIS IS SO CUTE I WANDJANDN
La amo
💋💋💋
2:30 I started to levitate 🫢 that was so good to my ears
This reminds me so much of the Beatles
Hope u r healthy and happy my love
I love Alex turner voice❤️❤️❤️❤️
Had to let u go cuz im not enuf
miss u N
Isn't he singing in a higher pitch than his actual voice? Like a falsetto or something? This ought to be hard to sing alive, I'm intrigued 🥺💖 great technique Alex! Loved the band and instrumentals, as usual you guys rock!.
Altro che maneskin
mano ta perfeito
Grande artista
Bowie
Te amo canción hermosa que me transporta a otro universo cuando cierro los ojos.
I love Alex's voice so much.
this is a certified arctic monkeys banger
He's like a sexy cross between young Bryan Ferry and David Byrne, with Elvis hips!
¡Se lucieron! 😍
....
his vocals suck.
OS MELHORES 🗿🎸🕶
Lenda faz assim
This comeback is getting exciting :D
Indo fans? 👀
This song feels like getting home at your parents house after you had a rough time  on your own
Boring
Vídeo lindíssimo
Arctic Monkeys NUNCA me va a decepcionar.
Somebody tell this guys this is shit. Can't believe they made up a second album like TBHAC. God, and I was thinking about going to see them in a concert, for what? To listen this crap?
slayed as always
Hermosa canción ❤️
Let's see when 10 million hits！！！ 👇
zzzzz
Love It
If only they worked as hard on crafting a decent song as they did on this video. This would not have made it on a early Bowie album let alone a promo track. Without the video as a distraction this sounds a pointless mess.
🖤
♥️♥️♥️
masterpiece
Space Oddity ????
😍😍😍😍
Got that Al Pacino, Robert De Niro vibe
Los sigo desde el primer disco. Y cuando cambiaron radicalmente en Humbug, no lo voy a negar, no me gusto al principio. Hoy es uno de mis discos favoritos. Arctic Monkeys es una banda musical de altísimo nivel y mucha Cultura, y hoy entiendo todo y cada vez que sacan una canción nueva, me emociona porque se que va a enriquecerme en Arte, tanto musical como visual. Gracias Monos del Ártico por tanto. 🇦🇷❤️👏🏼
Kinda reminds me of ELO. Just a bit! They really do reinvent themselves with every album and you can hear the story in every one. How does one NOT love this band??!
The closest to "our" Pink Floyd/Beatles we'll ever see.
This is probably the most beautiful music video i seen in my life.
🥰😻😻🥰🥰😻🥰😻🥰😻🥰😻🥰😻🥰😻🥰😻🥰😻🥰😻😻🥰🥰😻🥰😻🥰😻
💕💗💕💗💕💗💕💗💕💗💕💗💕💕💗💕💕💗💗💕💗🥰🥰🥰
I'd watch it in the cinema it's too good to be just a music video omg
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Art is AMANZIG
💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
Someone help me - what Pink Floyd song does the guitar in the chorus remind me of?? Driving me nuts!
Music, rain, coffe, you
IT’S SO FUCKING BEAUTIFUL
Beautiful
I can already tell that this album is going to be my favorite
Aging like finest wine
La nueva era Beatles de Arctic Monkeys
I adored the song from the moment I heard it. The songs is quite a deep reflection on himself and his personas of his past albums and himself as a person. His writing is incomparable and the way the stringed instruments slowly find a perfect way in and out is gorgeous. Not to mention hes done a lovely job of incorporating his original guitar sounds within it along with newer sounds of strings.
David Bowie vibes fer sure <3
gracias monos ❤✨ los amo.
🇵🇾
Look who's back 🔥
fuck everyone who doesn't like their new style because I just found my new favourite song. Alex is a genius
DALEEEE
T AMO ARCTIC MONKEYS❤
Remember my comment under the Mirrorball video comparing them to Bowie and The Beatles?   Some of you will kick off again but personally I think it’s aged very well indeed…
Please take a minute to listen to this song, it was recorded on a phone, set up on a barstool. Really cool sound. 3 peice from canada https://youtube.com/shorts/wcu0QOXl9Mg?feature=share
finally you are back
So this song talks about your love having an affair?
Ti adoroooooooo✨✨✨✨👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼🙋🏻‍♂️🙋🏻‍♂️ bellissima voce bye bye from Naples
Sad to see a once great band fall this low.
perfect❤❤❤❤
Loved it well done AM.
Les goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo......excited for new album
A retumbar las vocinas con este temazo por dioooos ❤❤
😒
Wow 😳 unbelievable
❤❤
Boring... :)
All hail the king!!!!!
this music video is definitely the best of 2022 i cant wait for the album
Brilliant!
Very similar to mirrorball, but I think the guitar licks are a fine addition, it keeps you drown in the song and focused, and gives the more mellowed first verses a good contrastation
Dribble🤦🏾‍♂️
Arte Monkeys UwU
So, I listened to the song first on spotify, then came to see the video because quite frankly I didn't really like the song on its own. The video definitely makes it more enjoyable, but I still hope Body Paint is one of the weaker tracks on the album, because I can't say I'll be listening to it much. I liked There'd Better Be A Mirrorball though, I love that song.
His soft singing 🥰
this album is gonna become so nostalgic i love this song
alex's voice sounds so warm and relaxing
guys help me on your legs part reminds me of another song which i can't remember
From 3:00 onwards why does it feel like there is a Bond theme vibe in there.
Man Alex's voice nowadays sounds so worn
Much better than I expected.
Lol this just reminds of Garth Merenghis Dark Place
What a great way to escape the modern world. Great music and fab video!
A True Masterpiece. I'm Blown Away.
Crying they are literally amazing
Love their growth. Their career is reminiscent of Radiohead’s growth in music. Would also like to hear a James Bond contribution from them❤
Enak nie lagunya buat santai
Well guys, what can I say ? As it is today, Arctic Monkeys are one of the most creatively free and heartwarming band to exist. Congratulations for all the evolution throughout the years, for never getting in the comfort zone and prove that you can reinvent yourselves, all the A.M. phases have very good thing to offer, TLSP also contributed a lot for Alex musical growth, and that reflected on Tranquility Base and now in the new singles, i wasn't this excited for an album release since Megadeth's United Abominations back in 2006, and it really makes me a very happy music lover to be alive and able to listen and watch a band like yours in action. If you intend coming to Brazil next year, I'll try my best to be at a show, the way you guys are playing now, the stage presence, the way you are making music and art, I simply cannot die in peace without watching you alive and in person. Thank you.
Well, you got to give it to them, they didn't make the same album seven times like everyone else would have
We love you from Chile 💗
ooooh goosebumps, here they come.
terrible, just like the previous record
Beatles Abbey Road vibes
Grande Alex siendo gooood
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Feels like the beatles
I can't get over how boring band AM become
Yo ngene ki lagune. Enak enak syahdu
Pretty sure ((they)) are laughing their asses off watching these npc's love their doomed future...  If just people could understand what they are saying... Oh, total chaos. I hope you lose, i really do; i want an utopia, we can all get one.
Parece que esses caras não sabem como fazer música ruim, uma banda que sempre se supera e inova a cada disco.
god this is treasure
😩💗
IS THAT A JOJOS REFERENCE
Can't wait October, 12th
He's like a modern day Elton John.
Incredible!
cringe
Something about Alex Turners lead/solo in the end section is reminiscent of Josh Homme in a funny way. Maybe be the tone?
TECUEME CHIKITA VIOLENTA 💜
Blessed
Babe wake up, new Arctic monkeys song just dropped
Arctic Monkeys with Major Tom attack Yellow Submarine with a paper spoon during A Day In Life backwards.
I saw the Monkeys at Sheffield Leadmill just around the time when they brought the first album out. In fact Alex Turner walked right past me.  Since that time, I’ve married and had two children. My eldest now loves them as much as I do (thanks to TikTok and 505).  I’ve grown up with them and I feel like this album will be their best yet. Love how their music has matured gracefully.
AHHHH
everything here is perfection
New album means new tour? 🥺
I love
Os maiores 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿❤
Eu já tô amando esse album🥰🥰🥰🥰👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
David turner or Alex Bowie ?
Hot tiktok 🔥 https://youtu.be/u7WdP_LgCvI
I think I will stay here
Sounds like Robbie Williams
so beautiful
WHO still listens in 1979?
Já agradeceu hj a pessoa que deu um piano pro Alex?
🛐🛐🛐
This is art erotica.
This is awful lets be real
reminds me of the beatles vibe
Great song
When i needed them most, they provided
Huge Beatles influence on this one!
Pqpppppppp
I really fell jn love
I can't get over how incredibly shit it is compared to the early stuff 💩💩💩
this based on my track 911 i had to say it pardon
put it on 1.5x speed.... you're welcome!! especially the last part
I love Alex's voice so much.
Beatles?

STILL A TRACE OF BODY PAINT!!!!!
miss the old songs
🇧🇷❤️🇧🇷✨
I'm lost for words. 💯
i love u<3
Arctic Monkeys is already a classic band
I'm so happy that they are getting into a much more experimental atmosphere. It makes their identity even stronger. I'm such a fan.
Brianstorm> Last two songs. Sorry but facts....
So they really just dropped a total masterpiece as the second single huh?  I liked the first single a lot, but this blows it out of the water. One of 2022's best songs!
Quisiera que me siguiese emocionando sus canciones como hace 10 años, que lástima 😪
this song is so AMAZING, it gives me paul mccartney vibes
Aaah, goosebumps.
é absurdo o crescimento dos keys da música, a melodia sobe de forma inesperada e cria um ambiente incrível junto com o clipe impecável vsf arctic monkeys é pura arte
🔥🔥🔥
Dreadful stuff
Beautiful cinematography, they're really honing in on this sound, this time sounding less like a David bowie rip off and instead sounding like their own thing
Beautiful,  I am loving everything so far from The car. This song gives me Paul McCartney's vibes
Ok it's a good thing I'm still alive
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=A0YwjrA5zlE
Greatest band of my generation back at it again ❤
Isso tá  I N C R Í V E L  Quem falar que é um TBHC 2 (pelo amor de Deus isso aqui tá milhões de vezes mais elaborado )  Vibe completamente diferente
enjoyable, felt D. Bowie-ish
Let’s be real, jamie is glowing
caramba essa música me lembrou One Point Perspective e só por causa disso eu já amei!! Arctic Monkeys definitivamente tá atualizando meu gosto musical de um jeito que nunca me aconteceu antes. Ainda não deixo de ouvir o AM, mas quando se trata de TBH&C eu percebo o quão diferente, o quão alto o nível é, e pra aceitar esse novo álbum temos que abrir nossas mentes de novo, pro novo e absurdo do Alex Turner. Eu te amo, Alex Turner.
So so so so so so so so sleepier
this one ain't for me
LYRICS  For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed, to lie in Do your time traveling through the tanning booth So you don't let the sun catch you crying   So predictable, I know what you're thinking   My teeth are beating and my knees are weak It's as if there's something up with the wiring You can poke your head behind the mountain peak It don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding   So predictable, I know what you're thinking   I'm watching your every move I feel the tears are coming on It won't be long It won't be long   Straight from the cover shoot There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I'm keeping on my costume And calling it a writing tool And if you're thinking of me I'm probably thinking of you   There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face So predictable, I know what you're thinking Ooh, hah, yeah
i'm afraid that this new album will sound just like TBHC
Absolutely incredible
Does anybody else get McCartney/Beatles vibes from this? Like, the chord changes, and the sound in general reminds me of I am the walrus idk why
0:41 gonna be my new phone desktop as a tarot bitch
To me it’s that kind of music you listen to when you simply want to appreciate music, the sounds, the tone. I don’t think it’s something I’d bump to daily, but it’s for sure something worth appreciating and sitting by. Great music!
DAVID BOWIE IS!
Beautiful
God I needed this
https://youtu.be/A0YwjrA5zlE
At this point I have to thank Alex Turner for expanding my vocabulary in English.. Every song, has a new word for me to look up! ❤️
Gucci Gucci
anzayyyy
this song is just a different gravy really. Its unique in it's own formidable way. Well done lads
I’ve been in love with this band since I was 13. I saw them live in 2014, 2018, and 2022. I’m 22 now and they still continue to wow me to this day, even as their style changes. Fucking awesome. Can’t wait for more.
Finally a great song to hear #2022
Modern day Jim Morrison IMO !
OMG THIS IS GORGEOUS 😭💞
Allez, comme le précédent, ça dégage.
Refrain reminds me of what they did on My Propeller
I’m so glad that they have become their essence from album to album
I love everything: voice, sound, mood, and video. And above all, the reference to Bowie. And Not to forget the sexiest man on the planet Alex Turner.
I love it
a stunning song 💥
Very reminiscent to the sound of The Last Shadow Puppets, going back to his rooooooots. I love it.
they became so soft...
Her duyguma ortaksın Arctic Monkeys💖
Alex Turner is the modern generation of Damon Albarn.
wah gila ini MVnya sakitttttttttttttttttttttt
❤
Alex and his Bowie vocals
joya <3 sublime
amo aquí🫶🏻
https://youtube.com/shorts/qRKjqXhXIjI?feature=share 🇧🇷🇧🇷
the beauty and aesthetics of this video are off the charts. the song is stunning. you know when arctic monkeys release a song, it's next level. never disappointing.
- how much grain and noise do you want? - YES
Parece uma música perdida do David Bowie!
Love that people are still buthurt it dosnt sound like AM
Creative self exploration is good n all but stuff doesn’t bang. I gotta miss old you. This sounds like a soundtrack for MONSTER INC cartoon
💩
I LOVE THIS
he estado esperando muchos años para esto, yo nunca sonrió pero esto, dibuja una sonrisa en mi rostro
🖤
It feels like drake bell fuck is it bad or not ı dunno really ı just mixed up
Really reminds me of Alex’s soundtrack to submarine <3
Is it just me or is Alex slowly morphing into Richard Hammond 🤔
What a blast of smooth sound from Artic Monkeys! Thank u guys for this soothing music.
Puro arte!!!!♥️
They always come back when we needed them the most
Anyone else getting Beatles vibes?
Que viagem esse clipe, véi
I am from Iran, please be our voice ✌🏽🖤 #mahsaamini
Amo vocês demais ❤
After 3 minutes in it starts to remind me of  Mick Ronson or The Beatles , I actually love this.
3:37 David Bowie?
INCREDIBLE SHOWSTOPPING AMAZING
the most entertaining part: 04:00
❤❤❤❤❤
Tell me you've listened to a lot of Bowie without telling me you listened to a lot of Bowie!
Los adoro
505 vibes ♥️♥️
Esse álbum vai ser pros cornos, amooo

Alex Turner could shart in a mic and people would still buy it thinking its the best thing since sliced bread.
Sigh, we have lost one of the worlds greatest rock bands. We have gained something 70ish, have to applaude them for changing and doing what they want at least. Though I am not sure if this is my style. I am a bit bored.
the music video is beautiful and this song is catchy, so excited for the album ! 😆
WTF this song!! why this song? arctic monkeys no more rock?? Arctic monkeys have lost their essence! so sad.
I like this atleast 60% more than their last single. Super cool!
Another album of elevator music it seems.
now this is art
feel like Alex is emulating David Bowie's voice (circa 70s) in this one :-)
¡Qué hype por el nuevo álbum!
i'm not saying i dislike the song but god AM Fandoms is unbearable, look at the comment section everyone is finding the most creative ways to jerk alex and the guys...."such sublime compositions" guys come on ahahahahahah
kpn konser ke indonesia ya om
early to this btw
Genuinely perfection, as everyone expected, I love how the music ages like fine wine with as the band does. Anyway heres the lyrics:   For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed to lie in Do your time travelling through the tanning booth So you don’t let the sun catch you crying  [Chorus] So predictable, I know what you're thinking  [Verse 2] My teeth are beating and my knees are weak It's as if there’s something up with the wiring You can poke your head behind the mountain peak Don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding [Chorus] So predictable, I know what you're thinking  [Bridge] I'm watching your every move I feel the tears are coming on It won't be long It won't be long Straight from the cover shoot Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I'm keeping on my costume And calling it a writing tool And if you’re thinking of me I’m probably thinking of you  [Instrumental Break]  [Refrain] There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There’s still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face You might also like Perfect Sense Arctic Monkeys Jet Skis On The Moat Arctic Monkeys Mr Schwartz Arctic Monkeys [Chorus] So predictable, I know what you're thinking  [Outro] Ooh, ha Yeah Yeah
One of the best song outro ever.
You can paint your body any which way it won’t stop what is required of you    The wages of sin is death, God is Life/existence/being, one of Gods attributes is being Holy I.e. without sin, since you’ve sinned you have become separated from God or Life, you will die because you are no longer attached to Life,  no one sends you to hell, you separate yourself from God  The doors are closing, don’t be left behind accept The Gospel today before time is up!  “Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:” ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭15:1-4‬ ‭KJV‬‬  “Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.” Romans‬ ‭3:19-26‬ ‭KJV‬‬  “that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭10:9-13‬ ‭KJV‬‬
Simplesmente incrível♥
I love you faithful Monkey fans 😅 Alex could record a fart and y'all be gushing Never change ❤️
Great i like this so much
Doesn't really do anything for me. Kind of a forgettable song.
I'm so pleased for these guys. I watched an interview with Matt Helders recently and he said he's just very happy to be making music with his mates. What a joy this must be to make and then play this beautiful stuff with your loved ones :)
Do you think hes singing about a girl or his shy real self like reflecting the journey of growing up?

I don’t wanna get off the Spaceship
Solo escribo esto aquí solo para volver a esta joya cada que alguien interactúe aquí
Leyendo respuestas por aquí, parece que a los Arctic les ponían una pistola en la cabeza para que hiciesen música mainstream, y que ahora por fin hacen lo que quieren... menuda chorrada. Los grupos evolucionan, al igual que las personas, y ahora hay que reconocer que la música que hacen los Arctic a ellos les entusiasmará y será lo que ellos quieren ahora, pero también tienen que ser conscientes de que a muchísima gente NO nos gusta, nos aburre, añoramos esa garra, esos ritmos, esas melodías hipnóticas, esas guitarras post-punk... hay grupos que evolucionan a mejor, quedándose con todo lo bueno de épocas anteriores (eso es evolucionar en positivo) y en mi humilde opinión, los Arctic han evolucionado a mucho peor. ¿Que a ellos les gusta y se sienten completos como personas? Fenomenal, me parece estupendo, pero conmigo que no cuenten.
No!
Slightly better than "the other one" can't even remember what it's called. Another shit song.
Jamais déçu par ces gars là ! :)
Por ustedes les hecho ganas a la escuela
los amo más que a mi vida
the little motif “bee beep boop beep boop boop beep” makes my yiddies tingle
Simplemente placentero 🤤👌🏻
I love when artists don't care what people will think and do exactly what they want
Oh Alex you always know how to put how I feel into words.  also he is aging so fucking well
No puedo parar de escucharlo, en serio es algo que necesitaba Gracias Monitos árticos por existir y hacer esta canción una joya
This new album probably won't be super popular, but this is exactly the sound and style that rock music needs right now. It harkens back to rock's golden days in the 70s without simply rehashing the past, and uses grainy 70s visuals in a way that feels new and original. Thank you guys for not resting on your laurels.
Sounds like Elenoir Rigby from Beatles! Violins are really similar 🌺
Crap
Absolutely love it!
Very, very cool.
I love there's monkeys uwu
oh wow the panels at the end creating a moving picture effect
addicted
Alex is accessing the core memories of a whole generation from the detective noir era 🤠🖤
I love it
hoooo HA yeaaah yeahh 😭😭😭
стиль!
WOW!
Here before 1M
What a song
2 balls..
Esta cancion me provoca un sentimiento de alegría y melancolía a la vez
le dije a mi novio que le diera like a esta canción porque es perfecta, el dice que soy una loca demente pero se que me adora
x1.75
Amazing song & mv
Mi novia me mando a darle like a esta canción es una loca demente
I love it but it is becoming more and more derivative. Its all stolen from music I love but is it quintessential Arctic Monkeys? I'm not so sure anymore. From the songs we've heard so far it definitely has a feel of volume 2 and Tranquility is volume 1. You could even put mirrorball and body paint in Tranquility album and it wouldn't sound too out of place. Loving the "Abbey Road" lead guitar on this. They used the same sound on tranquilities "she looks like fun" I believe.
This fucking SLAPS
4:00 🫣
I can't wait for their new album 🥲
3:01
🥱
My favorite flavor of Arctic monkey, feels kinda Submarine-ish ❤️
Nice! ❤
💕❤️💖💞
like perfect and unpredictable ♥️
Bohemias Rhapsody 🙌🏻
Very Bowie all the young dudes
Gahhh I missed them
I've just been getting into the songs you make and it is beautiful,Thank you for this emotion I feel.
Alex te amo
sounds like Alex Turner joined Portugal the man in 2010
He reminds me of the young Al Pacino.
todisima
Why does Alex laugh at me in this song?
This is art
Di kesunyian malam ini~
Una poesía musical. 🖤
alex t pegaron una patada en las pelotas y t pusieron a grabar pa
Hace tiempo que no escucho una banda haciendo MUSICA de verdad y menos en estos tiempos reggeatoneros. Mas fan de los arctic monkeys que nunca
Idk why but I'm finding it difficult to enjoy this album
the continuous of 'Anyways'
I am LOVING where this album's going
Theses guys never really let us down
GAHDAM THEY LOOK SO GOOD
I love so much this monkeys ❤
Suena bien pero ahi nomás. Nunca volverán a ser los de antes
First and last time listening to this song
Amo esto es como bailar en la luna JJAJAJQ
TEMAZOOO

Que
it’s amazing how they can make me feel so much emotions at the same time. every work they do its different from the last one. every element is on top, they’re sound it’s just perfect. love you 🐒❄️
evolution is real 💥
Quality music still but not the artic monkeys I fell in love with
Idk if it's just cuz this is my favorite band but I really like this song! I love the style :)
Simplemente una obra de arte
What a song is so nice for my ear, son una de las bandas más increíble que he escuchado sin duda que aplastarian a cualquier artista del momento como bad bunny por ejemplo
Obra prima ♡
This is the perfect mix between TBHC and they old stuff... I just love it
Vai se foder que obra prima meu deus🙏🏽
a day in life of The Beatles,  anyone?
Damn, i love this
Can't wait to hear the full album!!!
Everything they do is art
Los amo
AMOOOO❤❤❤
So it sounds like everyone’s getting another Alex Turner solo album then.
everyone go watch the jimmy fallon performance right now!
Alex from Sheffield would be very proud
Dios mío, jamás me cansaré de decir cuánto es que AMO TODO DE ESTA BANDA💓💓
Can we appreciate the moment when Jamie took off his sunglasses... Art
Esperando con ansias el álbum <3
1:33 something - beatles
I just know The Car is going to be amazing
This song is soooo good!
Dios te pedí un milagro no… olvídalo es lo mejor que ha pasado 🫶🏻
thank you❤️
PSDV
heaping pile of hot steamy stinky trash
Jdr se me erizo la piel de tan hermosa rolita<3
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I absolutely love this so much.
I was listening to this masterpiece at 1:30am, in the dark, with the volume on my headphones almost on max. And then, at 2:15 mark, I took one of the biggest scares of my live, when I could swear there was a woman speaking right behind my left ear. This music really made my heart beat faster!
so beautifully ✨beatlesque✨i love it
What a hit, man!
THIS IS SOO GOODDD T-T
"HAA" 👌🏻
Brasil??? 🇧🇷💙
Jesus fucking Christ this song is amazing
Aaahhh I love this!!!! ❣️✨
Definitely Not What I Was Expecting, But It's Nice. Excited For The Album!
joya de canción🚬
This video is a masterpiece, dope photography and direction 💕🥺 Btw I love the song too.
AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
what a good friday ⛅
es cine 🚬
te amo alex
Que videazo te❤❤❤❤
Esto es arte
505k views 😩
AND IF YOU’RE THINKING OF ME IM PROBABLY THINKING OF YOUUUU
arctic monkeys is the revolution
Yo creo que los monos están juntos en ésto porque si solo fueran ideas de Alex ya se hubieran separado pero no veo eso veo que todos están en el mismo tono sentido que se yo pero si se que se meten de la buena xd
Wasn't a huge fan of mirrorball but this song is great. Feels like a bit of a throwback to some of your older work
Uma das melhores bandas da atualidade 👏🏽👏🏽
Eles voltaram muito mais refinados ❤️❤️❤️🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽
Espero más personas escuchen esto
Tan bowie con un toque de the beatles
The cinematography was absolutely perfect,the song was amazing the drums the bass the guitar everything was absolutely perfect not a single drop of disappointment
Me encanta😍
this is quality for sure, but I just can't help but miss the old am sound
These last two albums have such Bowie energy.
there's some remaining love on your body
Excelente rapsodya de los monos al nivel de Queen?
Amo cada etapa de los Arctic Monkeys 🥰
That bass line is just insane
Llegué, tarde, pero seguro ❤️
amo vcs, nao conseguem errar nunca
Esto es evolución: crear y re inventarse una y otra vez. Y uno reconoce su talento, su creatividad, el genio de Alex. CÓMO JUEGA CON LA MELODÍA, LOS INSTRUMENTOS, LA VOZ CON SU CAMBIO DE TONOS. UNA OBRA DE ARTE
Me pone triste que en su setlist actual casi ya no estén sus clásicos , pero Arctic Monkeys si es una banda de indie rock, por qué? Porque para ser indie no se trata de vestirte como un soft boy cualquiera y ser uno más del resto para aparecer en la escena, ser indie es ser independiente a lo que la gente piensa y hacer lo que se te cante, Alex Turner y los muchachos son unos de los pocos que aún sos artistas de verdad
Love you guys
DAMN THEY’RE BACK
Arctic Monkeys siempre apostando por el talento y la calidad 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
lo hubiera escuchado con ella 😓
Love, love, love ❤❤❤
Aaaaa omgg 🖤
I love the way their evolution as a band is reflected in their new music, can't wait to hear the whole album.
AAAAAAAAA I LOVE IT! THIS IS FANTASTICK!
Saya rasa kalian bakal menyukainya  ... https://youtu.be/FkAbZrqvvjQ
Alex is aging like Brett Anderson.
huhhhh finallyy😔😔❤️‍🩹
amazing cinematography and song 🤩
The best song
👍
this album is an actual need. they’ve changed my life.
AMO 😍😍😍😍
I enjoyed
OMG, AAAAAAAH, ME ENCANTA, SIMPLEMENTE PERFECTO. DIOSSSS LA VOZ, LA VOZ, ¡LA VOZ! &@+$-+@:_(@:(_;# OMG, TE AMO MONOS ÁRTICOS, SIEMPRE TRAENDO LA BENDICIÓN.
the name “Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not” is still getting mileage every time they produce a gorgeous new album full of sound they’ve never quite explored before, i love seeing what they do next everytime 🥰
♪La música ha revivido ♪
It sounds like it got some inspiration from Bohemian Rhapsody- Queen
Porqué me divorcié de mi ESPOSA RUSA??? https://youtu.be/Djoe1CyaqiE
I LOVE THEM
Seems to be that Alex has been listening The Beatles White Album a lot😆
simply what to do is magical
TEMAZO.
Arctic Monkeys esta catalogado como Indie. Indie es independiente. Arctic Monkeys es independiente a lo que dirán y seguirán creciendo en lo que hacen.
this top shelf writing production performance and mixing
AE CARAIO
holy fuck ❤
IHHHHHHHH.
i was rlly hoping we’d get that rock vibe again BUT THIS IS SO GOOD OML BETTER THAN I COULDVE ANTICIPATED
Its look like a beatles music and a beatles video clip, really good arctic monkeys dont stop getting better.
I can hear the AM fans rumbling rn🤭
los amoooo
Dude, such a great masterpiece. I'm very excited about the new album.
<3
❤
This is a great song and I’m very thankful it came out when it did bc I got suspended and everything taken away from me almost but hey new arctic monkeys song came in clutch
this goes so hard
Too bad....
Me duermo zzzzz😴
Obra sublime de Arctic Monkeys que te hace volar 😲🤯🇨🇱
Lyrics💖  For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed, to lie in Do your time traveling through the tanning booth So you don't let the sun catch you crying  So predictable, I know what you're thinking  My teeth are beating and my knees are weak It's as if there's something up with the wiring You can poke your head behind the mountain peak It don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding  So predictable, I know what you're thinking  I'm watching your every move I feel the tears are coming on It won't be long It won't be long  Straight from the cover shoot There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I'm keeping on my costume And calling it a writing tool And if you're thinking of me I'm probably thinking of you  There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face So predictable, I know what you're thinking Ooh, hah, yeah
The best song ever.
A fucking masterpiece
His voice is so transcendent and so calming while being easily recognizable and that’s why I love Alex’s music.
TELAVERGA WEY PINCHE ARTE DE DIOS LA MEJOR CANCIÓN QUE EXISTE
Los amo
Who want to enjoy a pack of cigarettes while listening to a artic monkeys with me?
Here's the lyrics to "Body Paint"  For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed, to lie in Do your time traveling through the tanning booth So you don't let the sun catch you crying  So predictable, I know what you're thinking  My teeth are beating and my knees are weak It's as if there's something up with the wiring You can poke your head behind the mountain peak It don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding  So predictable, I know what you're thinking  I'm watching your every move I feel the tears are coming on It won't be long It won't be long  Straight from the cover shoot There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I'm keeping on my costume And calling it a writing tool And if you're thinking of me I'm probably thinking of you  There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face So predictable, I know what you're thinking Ooh, hah, yeah
WHY DOES HIS VOICE FIT THIS SONG SO DAMN WELL!?
✨Arctic Monkeys✨
WHY THIS ISN'T 1 MILLION VIEWS YET???
BOM DEMAIS CARAI
They'll made us wait for 4 long years, but this masterpiece is worth it. That's Arctic Monkeys for you You never know what they'll do next but it's sure to blow your mind and scratch your soul.
Pinche canción espectacular ❤
YES ALEX
AAHHHHHHH
How you can do this perfect music
don't tell me this album is going to be the same as the previous one :'(
So good to listen to and to watch this *timeless art* 🖤
❣️
Well now I need a les Paul and some body paint
Wes Anderson makes a new movie and this is the soundtrack Thank you
Los amo tanto.
Pure gold 🙏😎🍻
Everyone has a right to opinion. As their fan, and also a musician, somebody who was waiting for a long time to hear their new album- this a major BS! Wtf honestly? Is this some none melodic pop acid jazz? If there is something like that at all 😕😒
Thank you
Every direction, every era, every thing they craft is amazing. This is still Arctic Monkeys. They've grown, they've reinvented themselves again and again. They're the same kids from sheffield, but different age. It's a pleasure to grow with them, to explore, to be able to take this in. This is already my fav AM song at the moment. Can't wait for whatever else is instore. Masterpiece after masterpiece
What happened to the Arctic monkeys? I used to love this band and now they just flat out suck
Que canción!!!! son todos ambientes distintos en todo el tema, pocas bandas pueden hacer eso, y que funcione bien. quiero escuchár el disco ya
is it weird that based off this song im already pumped for their next album maybe around 2027
They turn into a wedding band
Vídeo digno de una canción
Gracias Arctic Monkeys, los conoci por casualidad en un programa de videos (que ni siquiera veia) del canal 11 de México allá por el 2007 con teddy picker  Ahora llevo 15 años escuchando esta maravillosa banda y me encantan en cada faceta de su carrera, siempre me recomiendan bandas similares pero no, no soy fan del género, solo soy fan de los Arctic Monkeys ❤️🇲🇽
I FUCKIN LOVE U GUYS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EXISTING YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Ugh, this is really so beautiful. 💛💛💛 SO beautiful! This means so much to me.
Es que me encanta la melodía, el estribillo, la letra, todooo, no hay canción que no hagan perfecta 😭💕
0:18
10 d 10 Grande los Arctic monkeys,Pinche banda espectacular¡¡❤👏
that was so good !
Je dois donc faire définitivement le deuil des titres endiablés tels que "I bet that you look good on the dancefloor" ou " Crying lightning".   J'aurais du plus en profiter malheureusement !
que privilegio haber escuchado esto en pleno estreno
The cinematography is incredible
YES
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Desde el 2:33 hasta el 2:45 por ahí tiene casi un sonido similar a alguna canción de Bowie, no sé jaksajsa. ¡QUÉ BELLEZA DE CANCIÓN!
love it. love it all.
2:03  🥰
I feel pretty bad for the people tha hasn't evolve with the band, you guys are missing a lot. This is just fuckin perfection. The song, the video, alex... existing xd
I love new song

well, this is gonna be my personality for the rest of my life
La madurez musical de Turner es impresionante! El tipo se sigue superando con cada álbum, es de otra generación está música, quizás ésta generación no valore esta joya
MÚSICA DE CALIDAD
Hermosa.
Freaking cool!!!! Loveee💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
wow
AM esta a otro nivel
¿Es Body Paint la mejor canción que he escuchado en toda la vida? Absolutamente SI
Masterpiece Thank you
el mejor día de mi vida lo juro
Eargasmn
La experimentacion que tienen los monos del arctico es excepcional. Cuando escucho la parte del 2:28 y la parte final, me hacen en pensar en la misma experiemntacion que tuvieron los Beatles en Let It Be, Abbey Road o en St. Pepper, con los nuevos sonidos, la variacion en el tempo y esas cosas. Es increible que hayan vuelto con canciones asi, muchos dicen que es un Tranquility Base 2, y creo que The Car va mas alla de eso
Que innovador al integrar más instrumentos no tan usados en los anteriores discos ,estos 2 sencillos han sido obras de arte con producción de dioses
si Alex
What it means to authentically love what you do
Arctic monkeys turns in diarrhea
ALGUIEN CON DEPRESION, AL TOPARTE CON ESTO, FLORECE DE NUEVO ESA ENERGIA Y GANAS DE SONREIR VUELVES A QUERER DISFRUTAR LO BUENO DE LA VIDA. ARCTIC MONKEYS ES DE LO BUENO DE LA VIDA Y COMO FAN, AGRADEZCO POR SER AFORTUNADO Y ENCONTRARME ESCUCHANDO LAS NUEVAS JOYAS DE LOS MONOS. BRINDO Y RECUERDO CON AMOR Y NOSTALGIA A LOS FANS QUE PERDIERON LA LUCHA SIN VOLVER A ESCUCHAR NUEVA MUSICA DE ARCTIC MONKEYS, HONRARE SU MEMORIA DISFRUTANDO CADA CANCION COMO SI AUN ESTUVIERAN AQUI CON NOSOTROS.  CUANDO YA ENTRASTE EN LA HISTORIA COMO UNA DE LAS MEJORES BANDAS DEL NUEVO SIGLO, PUEDES DARTE EL LUJO DE HACER LA MUSICA QUE TE PLAZCA SIN QUE TE IMPORTE EL QUE DIRA LA CRITICA, Y AUN ASI TERMINAR HACIENDO ALGO JODIDAMENTE BUENO Y EPICO.  HABRA A QUIENES NO LES GUSTE ESTE NUEVO RUMBO DE LA BANDA Y ESO TAMBIEN ES BUENO, PERO NO ENTIENDEN QUE NO SOLO EVOLUCIONAN Y MADURAN COMO MUSICOS, SINO COMO PERSONAS TAMBIEN. Y NO VAN A ESTAR COMPONIENDO COMO SI TUVIERAN 17 AÑOS, Y NO VA A HACER MUSICA ESPERANDO APROBACION DE BANDA DE 15 , 30, 70 O MAS AÑOS, CUANDO A ESTAS ALTURAS YA NO TIENEN QUE DEMOSTRAR ALGO.  NO TIENES PORQUE DECEPCIONARTE SI NO ESCUCHAS EL SONIDO QUE ESPERABAS, IGUAL PUEDES  DEJARTE SORPRENDER POR LOS NUEVOS SONIDOS Y NUEVAS FORMAS QUE TIENEN PARA PRESENTARNOS SU MUSICA.  O, PASAR DE LARGO Y ESCUCHAR LA MUSICA DE LOS OTROS MILLONES DE ARTISTAS QUE HAY POR EL MUNDO Y QUE HUBO EN LA HISTORIA SIN TIRAR ODIO. SI TE GUSTA PERFECTO, SI NO TE GUSTA, DEJA DISFRUTAR LA MUSICA A QUIENES SI QUIEREN DISFRUTARLA.  JOYA "BODY PAINT"! JOYA "THE CAR" SI, DEFINITIVAMENTE, ARCTIC MONKEYS ES CINE, ES ARTE. ARCTIC MONKEYS ES VIDA.
I hate how actual AM seems to be the Alex's support band
LOS AMO
Lo mejorrrrr
a lot of sgt pepper's lonely hearts club band. grow and grow.
es cine 🚬
no idea what to make of this song. Maybe after ten more listens I'll have an opinion
Man, from the bottom of my heart I love this song
♡
🔥🔥
Me recuerda a un album de The Beatles en su epoca Sgt peppers
me encanta arctic monkeys, es lo mejor que me a pasado haber descubierto a alex turner
LOS AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
AY DIOS NO PUEDE SER LOS AMO
The new arctic monkeys music feels like a old Beatles song. Love it

secrets that I keep in my heart 💞
oh???
Dizendo para mim mesmo desde que ouvi pela primeira vez que isso é incrível, mas isso já é previsível.
the last part is so awesoomeeee🔥🎸
t amo arctic monkeys
Dios, amo esta banda.<3
Al parecer sigue la cadena de está fase revival setentera de los AM en el actual 2022 pero también retoma los recursos del pop barroco al que estamos acostumbrados cada 8 años con TLSP, el coro me hace recordar un poco al estilo de Elliot smith, y después llega la parte que será perfecta en vivo, el solo es penetrante con ese estilo de Alex que reconocemos desde 505, me atrevería a decir que este álbum será más digerible THBC pero aún me quedan dudas, también noto algo de la atmósfera que me recuerda a su trabajo produciendo a Alexandra savior, eso significa que ya podríamos entender cómo es el "sonido" Alex Turner cómo por ejemplo es el "sonido" Mac demarco, (ambos revival)
Los amo^^
Amooooooooooo millonessssss.......... A ALEX TURNER ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻
😍
Si me gustó
🤩🤩🤩 me encanta!
DIOOOOSSS
Amazing
de alguna manera se volvieron predecibles y repetitivos, tanto así que lo visual tiene que ser lo destacable en una banda musical. y su sonido pretencioso esta blindado, si no te gusta otros te dicen que es porque esta muy avanzado para ti, de alguna manera encontraron el negocio perfecto
always calming
this is one of my favorite music videos ever
Joder!! En efecto es arte 🚬👄
구뜨
This song is so fun.
Probably the hardest song on the album
David Bowie
<333
Amooooooooooooooo, lo malo es que cuando salio estaba en la escuela
Very Beatles - esque
Te quiero mucho arctic monkeys
lo amo y punto

I love this ALBUM! 🖤
✧*｡٩(ˊᗜˋ*)و✧*｡
This sucks, middle of the road bs
Estou tão feliz de ver isso no dia da estreia, isso vai ficar marcado na minha  vida, Alex Turner está me proporcionando uma experiência maravilhosa
Esta increíbleee
Entre más maduros, más les gusta hacerle a la mmda
Music for a true girlboss. AM gets it and slays
This is absolutely brilliant 👏🏼 stuck in my head, I don't even know what genre of music it is! Whatever it is, u actually really like it !
Aguanten los Monkeys vieja! No me importa nada!
Alex is so fine and so talented, his voice is just magical!
Eu quero tanto o álbum completo. Ver a imersão por inteiro. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I love Mirrorball  but I think this song is a step above it. I feel an amazing album is coming!!!
It's like melted gold in my ears, i love It.
¡Artimonki!
Masterpiece..
AAMPPPUUUNNN ARCTIC MONKEEY AMMMMPPOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN

im in love😢😢😢❤❤❤❤
Holy shit, ALEX BLOODY TURNER.
arte
Love to see it
I get that artists change with their style, but God I find them SO BORING now. What a shame. I wish them the best nonetheless, bunch of oldies.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Letra en español: Tatuajes de tus besos llevo en todo mi cuerpo... 💔😭🎵
Absolutely outstanding 🤯🤯🤯
4:12 THAT CLOSE-UP OMG 😍
Ersatz Bowie.
son unos capo monos
the beatles + pink floyd
I LOVE THIS
Desde que salió Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino supe que Alex quería seguir en esa línea, después de todo es donde más cómodo veo que se siente, en fin, The car es una secuela del TBH&C. Nunca me baje del barco
Legitimately my favorite Arctic Monkeys track ever
I LOVE YOU
MASTERPIECE
Last shadow monkeys
mds eu amei tanto esse clipe
La evolucion que a tenido la banda a sido muy notoria, el reinvertarse siempre  es para bien y creo que este album no sera la exepcion, la banda a crecido, a madurado pero siguen teniendo la misma escencia como al principio. Larga vida a los Arctic Monkeys, saludos desde PUEBLA MEXICO!!
Ese final de guitarras es un diamante en bruto. Larga vida a los Arctic!!!
Me suena a un tranquility base 2.0😎😎
Happy they used the electric guitar. That instrument really feels like the heart of their sound. I would have preferred they used it throughout the whole song because it sounds very sweet in the latter half.  I’ve noticed with Mirrorball and this song, they sort of start slow and build up to a more intense ending.
this what i want
I’ve enjoyed watching their evolution. Not only of their music but their cinematography as well
The Monkeys are back
Wow its a good music video. Love the cinematography
god
Looks like mini mansion
Mágico, sublime, dulce
I'm here
grabe na
Los amo  Arctic monkeys los amoo
pov: your food in the microwave
Aah my Alex how I adore you man, you've not ever looked as good as you do now, I hope you find someone spesh who'll love you truly and who'll match you in talent and banter and (more importantly) who'll  keep you on your toes, you're so beloved to me
Arctic monkeys are aging like a fine wine
ahaha vocals caught me so off guard

Estoy amando esta vibra 💜
Me recuerda al mismo tipo de metamorfosis que paso con the Beatles y su radical cambio de estilo de rock en este caso para mi seria un AM(A Hard Days Night) y su cambio a partir del TBH&C ( Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band). Fenomenal
I'm crying this is so beautiful
LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
"woo hooo... ha!" part 😭🤣
Parece que este álbum va a rendir homenaje la cinematográfia de Hitchcock, tanto en lo visual como en el sonido.
Wow.. i just fall in love again with them.. this gave me chills🥰 such a beautiful song and i'm loving this new era, You can notice they are mature now, and Alex's voice is amazing😍
This song sucks
this song 🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻😩😩😩🤰🤰🤰
essa música tá tão gostosa de ouvir... meu Deus do céu
I LUVVV THIS BAND SO FUCKINGGG MUCHHH AWGHHHH
This is so visually stunning
Desde siempre y para siempre 💘❤️‍🩹
Daddyyy-- PLEASE T_T
TE AMO ALEX SÉRIO
I can already hear thousands of people singing this altogether. It's gonna sound biblical.
Reminds me of a Wes Anderson film
ARTE ESTO RS ARTE DEFINITIVAMENTE
Puro monos articos 🎸🎧
Uau que música linda ❤❤❤❤❤❤
A melhor banda 😊
Es como si estuviera viendo una película con un increíble soundtrack
I want this song as my forever ringtone 🎶💗
Lo que amo es que aún siguen juntos, haciendo música juntos❤ a pesar de que se decía que pronto se iban a separar.  Siguen siendo los cuatro chicos de Sheffield.
I can see that I'll be just like my father, who listens to Beatles and goes to Paul MacCartney's shows every year, but with Arctic Monkeys instead of the Liverpool quartet. Yes, AM is in that point in the career. Legendaries!
Once I like you, I'll like you forevahh.
🔥🔥🔥
"Body Paint"  For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed, to lie in Do your time traveling through the tanning booth So you don't let the sun catch you crying  So predictable, I know what you're thinking  My teeth are beating and my knees are weak It's as if there's something up with the wiring You can poke your head behind the mountain peak It don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding  So predictable, I know what you're thinking  I'm watching your every move I feel the tears are coming on It won't be long It won't be long  Straight from the cover shoot There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I'm keeping on my costume And calling it a writing tool And if you're thinking of me I'm probably thinking of you  There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face So predictable, I know what you're thinking Ooh, hah, yeah

Hot take: This song is better than Mirrorball
Sounds like he’s eating a scone while singing
I love you deeply, I really love your music, this is the best band for me, it's magic.
My heart is pounding, and I think that's a good thing.
The Intro Sounds like Bohemian rhapsody’s one.

Alex Turner está infravalorado.
I really love them, I really love this song but c'mon! People in the comments saying that they are "The best band in the world"? "They are revolutionary"? "No other band is making this type of music"? "No other band is risking as they do"?. You really need to hear more music, you would be very surprised.
Ah amoooo ❤✨

the feeling when a band you like is releasing absolutely mindblowingly incredible music and you get to be there for it is truly ✨unmatched✨
WHAT IS THE GOSPEL? The Gospel is good news: Your debt has been paid; Your penalty has been carried out. That’s what the word “Gospel” means.   “Propitiation” in the Bible is defined as “the act of gaining or regaining the favor or goodwill of someone or something; the act of appeasement as in a sacrifice; specifically an atoning sacrifice.”   2 Corinthians 5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.   Jesus allowed Himself to be the appeasement to the Father for all our sins. He was not forced to do this, but did so willingly. (John 10:18) Also, He gave Himself as the pure and acceptable sacrifice, not only for God’s chosen Jewish people, but for everyone in the world for all time. (John 10:16)   For just a brief moment of His agony, our Savior experienced what it would be like to be separated from the Father forever. This was the moment He dreaded the most of the entire crucifixion, when God would have to look away as His Son took on every sin this world would ever commit. That would’ve been the moment when Jesus exclaimed; “My God! My God! Why have You forsaken Me?” (Matthew 27:46)    Being a perfect and righteous God, He can tolerate no sin whatsoever. There are people who believe they have never sinned, but Romans 3:23-25 and Romans 6:23 sets this straight. Romans 3:23-25; “for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, (24) and are justified by His grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, (25) whom God put forward as a propitiation by His blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God’s righteousness, because in His forbearance, He had passed over former sins.” This is emphasized in Psalm 103:12 that states our sins are removed “as far as east is from west”. Only the perfect sinless blood of Jesus could accomplish this.   Going to Romans 6:23, we see just how the Father feels about sin, and just how important the sacrifice of our Savior really was; “For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”   THE GOSPEL!   BELIEVE and RECEIVE Jesus' free gift of salvation: 📖1 Corinthians 15: 1-4  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the GOSPEL which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are SAVED, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ DIED for our SINS according to the scriptures; And that he was BURIED, and that he ROSE again the third day according to the scriptures:     The only hope we have is Jesus. Jesus is the answer. He’s the only answer, and He’s the only hope. And His return for us as His church is our only hope. That’s what the good news is.   In fact, in 1 Thessalonians, the first epistle that the Apostle Paul wrote, he shares the gospel in the context of the Rapture in Chapter 4 of 1 Thessalonians, saying, for we believe that Jesus was crucified, buried, and rose again on the third day, and He’s coming back again one day. That’s the good news.   RELIGION SAYS DO. JESUS CHRIST SAYS DONE!!   Soon one life will be PAST and that which only was done for Jesus Christ will LAST!   📖Ephesians 1:13-14 13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, 14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.   📖2 Corinthians 11:3 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.   Do You Know God Personally? God LOVES you and offers a wonderful PLAN for your life.   God’s Love “God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life”   God’s Plan [Jesus speaking] “I came that they might have life, and might have it abundantly” [that it might be full and meaningful” (John 10:10).   Why is it that most people are not experiencing the abundant life? Because…Man is SINFUL and SEPARATED from God. Therefore, he cannot know and experience God’s love and plan for his life.   Man Is Sinful “All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). Man was created to have fellowship with God; but, because of his stubborn self-will, he chose to go his own independent way, and fellowship with God was broken. This self-will, characterized by an attitude of active rebellion or passive indifference, is an evidence of what the Bible calls sin.   Man Is Separated “The wages of sin is death” [spiritual separation from God] (Romans 6:23). Man is continually trying to reach God and the abundant life through his own efforts, such as a good life, philosophy, or religion – but he inevitably fails. The only way to bridge this gulf…   He Died in Our Place “God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8).    He Rose From the Dead “Christ died for our sins…He was buried…He was raised on the third day, according to the Scriptures…He appeared to Peter, then to the twelve. After that He appeared to more than five hundred…” (1 Corinthians 15:3-6).    He Is the Only Way to God “Jesus said to him, ‘I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but through Me’” (John 14:6).   This shows that God has bridged the gulf which separates us from Him by sending His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross in our place to pay the penalty for our sins. It is not enough just to know this…We must individually RECEIVE Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord; then we can know and experience God’s love and plan for our lives.   We Must Receive Christ “As many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, even to those who believe in His name” (John 1:12)    We Receive Christ Through Faith “By grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, that no one should boast” (Ephesians 2:8,9).When We Receive Christ, We Experience a New Birth ( John 3:1-8).   We Receive Christ by Personal Invitation [Christ speaking] “Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any one hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him” (Revelation 3:20). Receiving Christ involves turning to God from self (repentance) and trusting Christ to come into our lives to forgive our sins and to make us what He wants us to be. Just to agree intellectually that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that He died on the cross for our sins is not enough. Nor is it enough to have an emotional experience. We receive Jesus Christ by faith, as an act of the will. All the work of salvation was done by Jesus Himself. He took upon Himself the punishment for our sins as well as the sins themselves, and went to the cross and paid for every sin that would ever be committed throughout history.   WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE BORN AGAIN?...   The phrase “born again” applies to people who have accepted Jesus as their Savior or Redeemer. The born again soul realizes that they are a sinner (Romans 3:23) and that the penalty for that sin is death (Romans 6:23). To rectify the circumstances, God sent His only Son to die in their place, to take the punishment for sin (Romans 5:8). After Jesus’ death, He arose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:3-6). Jesus is the only way to God (John 14:6) and He provides the blessing of salvation. Each person has the choice to receive or reject God’s gift through faith (Ephesians 2:8-9) and experience new birth (John 3:1-8).    WHAT IS BIBLICAL REPENTANCE? Biblical repentance is God centered repentance comes from the greek word 'METANOIA' which means change of one's mind and heart which imparts a new direction to the whole life. Repent (To repent, in relation to salvation, is to change your mind from unbelief to belief in Jesus Christ. To being dead in your sins to a new creature in Christ) and believe in the Gospel.   The ABCs of Salvation:   The A is for: Admit or acknowledge that you’ve sinned, that you need the Savior. Romans 3:10 says, “There is no one righteous, not even one.” Romans 3:23 tells us why. It’s because “All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” Romans 6:23 says, “The wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”   The B very simply is for: Believe in your heart that Jesus Christ is Lord. Romans 10:9-10 says, “If you believe in your heart that God raised Jesus from the dead, you will be saved.”   The C stands for: Call upon the name of the Lord. Or as Romans 10:9-10 also says, “If you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.” Here’s why, “For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.” Romans 10:13 tells us how. It says, “All who call upon the name of the Lord will be saved.”   Here is the article on my website...https://www.rapturecountdown.com/eternal-life-through-the-shed-blood-of-jesus-christ-is-a-free-gift-that-you-can-receive-right-now/   My pdf on the TOP 20 END TIME SIGNS speaks on the 2 words CONVERGENCE and AGENDA that define the very final moments that we are living in!

I feel like the arctic monkeys music is expanding so much, like being transported to the beyond
Gostei. Parece um amadurecimento do TBHC, é um disco pra ouvir em momentos de chuva, refletindo sobre a vida.
because the songs they make are so good?
AMOOOO, INCREÍBLE CANCIÓN 💖💖
I LOVE IIIIIIT, IS SO MAGIC...😍🥰🥰🥰🥰
I need a ringtone of this
i love this style to music, it's amazing!!💗

Pinches últimos dos minutos te dejan sin aliento, una cosa de otro planeta este videoclip, nunca me había emocionado tanto con un video.

Alex turner
their songs going back to timeless classics
<333
Está buena sigan haci fieraso
SO FUCKING COOL
que caralho de banda boa
si estás pensando en mí Probablemente estoy pensando en ti...
of all their newer songs, I feel that this song in particular encompasses their growth the best - this song is a perfect mix of their newer style (esp the 1st half) and older style (the riffs were very reminiscent of the older albums). This song (and the music video!) is just a masterpiece, absolutely loved it, and it was amazing to hear Alex's higher notes too! Love love love how much they've evolved as a band 💖💖💖
Body Paint Lyrics  [Verse 1] For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed, to lie in Do your time traveling through the tanning booth So you don’t let the sun catch you crying  [Chorus] So predictable, I know what you're thinking  [Verse 2] My teeth are beating and my knees are weak It's as if there’s something up with the wiring You can poke your head behind the mountain peak It don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding  [Chorus] So predictable I know what you're thinking  [Bridge] I'm watching your every move I feel the tears are coming on It won't be long It won't be long  [Refrain] Straight from the cover shoot There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I’m keeping on my costume And calling it a writing tool And if you’re thinking of me I'm probably thinking of you  [Refrain] There’s still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face So predictable I know what you’re thinking Ooh, hah, yeah
Yess
Que emoción me transmite el oír nueva melodía para mis oídos de los monos del ártico. Encantado y feliz ♡
Ni lo he escuchado pero que joya 😍🥰💋
este álbum va a terminar de romperme el corazón
Maravilloso
Para un maestro del engaño y  el subterfugio  Te has hecho toda la cama, para acostarte  Haz tu tiempo viajando a través de la cabina de bronceado  Así no dejas que el sol te atrape llorando Tan predecible, sé lo que estás pensando  Mis dientes están latiendo y mis rodillas son débiles  Es como si hubiera algo mal con el cableado  Puedes asomar tu cabeza detrás del pico de la montaña  No tiene que significar que te has escondido  Tan predecible, sé lo que estás pensando  Observando cada uno de tus movimientos, siento que las lágrimas se aproximan  No pasará mucho tiempo No pasará mucho tiempo  Directamente desde la sesión de portada Todavía hay un rastro de pintura corporal En tus piernas y en tus brazos y en tu cara  Y sigo con mi disfraz  Y lo llamo una herramienta de escritura Y si estás pensando en mí Probablemente estoy pensando en ti Todavía hay un rastro de pintura corporal En tus piernas y en tus brazos y en tu cara  Todavía un rastro de pintura corporal  En tus piernas y en tus brazos y en tu cara  Todavía un rastro de pintura corporal  En tus piernas y en tus brazos y en tu cara  Todavía un rastro de pintura corporal  En tus piernas y en tus brazos y en tu cara  Tan predecible, sé lo que estás pensando...
deixei meu dislike e vazeeeei

Es sin duda un estilo diferente el que exploran desde hace algunos lanzamientos, alejado de sus temas un poco mas juveniles, mas abstracto, pero esta bien que los artistas sepan reinventarse y no repetir formulas
This is so cool.
wow
No puedo esperar a escuchar todo el álbum!!! Si está canción es hermosa no me imagino las demás. 💗
Amoooooo
Holy shit! This is phenomenal, magnificent, aesthetically stunning.
No esperaba una nueva canción. ¡Gracias!😍
Thanks for everything
Bueno dónde está el man de las letras??

Brilliant stuff
When Arctic Monkeys Traveled in Time to record an album... And met The Beatles, David Bowie and Electric Light Orchestra  The Song
I get Elton Johns vibes from this
Sentindo que esse álbum vai virar um dos meus favoritos...
As i said this is the son of am and tlsp
Magritte vibe🍏
Amo sus canciones más que a nada en mi vida entera, pero no puedo amarlas más que a mi vida porque sus canciones son mi vida

Am I the only one that thinks that "still a trace of body paint" means there's still a part of their early Rock days still alive in them
William afton
JODERRRRRRR COMO LOS AMOOO😔😻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙌🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
Esperaba tanto esta canción, es mas que perfecta ❤
Very big TLSP vibe
They've changed their style with every new album they've released. And every album they've released has been a magnum opus in its own right. Their journey from old-school guitar rock to gorgeous, graceful ballads like this song and Mirrorball is truly something to behold. They're one of the greatest bands out there today (second only to Alvvays). Brilliant stuff.
ESTO ES ARTE WAAA
COMO SÃO ARTISTAS!!!
crying
Really beautiful video
Do I even like this as just a song and not as an AM's song?
my younger sister could not have said it any better when listening to it: "it sounds kinda like elton John but better" and I think it describes it perfectly.
they are in their world
🫶
There legends
I loved this the visuals Alex's voice still so soothing the beat and rhythm flow so easily I forget what's going on in the world I'm just so memorized                    _Beautiful_                   _Stunning_          _And Perfect Timing_

Yo me esperaba otra cosa escucho los arctic desde su primer ep, y cada disco que escuchas no tienen nada que ver con el otro, ahora veo que se quedaron con esta onda de tranquility base, la verdad si no esucho guitarras o a matt rompiendo la bateria, para mi no es los arctic monkeys.

AME AME AME
Esses videoclipes das músicas de 'The Car' estão todos maravilhosos! Já gosto das músicas só pelos clipes, simplesmente maravilhosos!
AM meets Bowie, love love love!!
qui lindu cara
De la PTM  Alex mejoró muchísimo su voz en este álbum por Yahveh!
It is sexy sadie by the beatles + soul love by Bowie ?
Wow incredible
Fantástico!! ✨️
wow
Creo que tengo una gotita es esperanza con esta cancion, medio pelo pero al final pareciera que se puso buena. Necesito la opinión de alguien que los haya escuchado realmente desde antes de que entre O'Malley al bajo y me diga si le gusta el rumbo que esta tomando esta banda y que no va hacer que me quede con la melancolia de los discos anteriores descartando el utlimo que es solo de Alex imponiendo el audio que tiene en su proyecto solista.
Omg that ending
AM is my religion 🙌🏼🤍
Tranquility bass hotel and casino is back and i live for it
Do you think all the songs are going to end up being slow in the new album
Holy sh*t.
I love it💗💗💗💗
Yesss I needed more of dis band ahhhh
Es como esas canciones de broma de show de tv, esas que les cambian las letras.😅
NO PUEDOO BAstaaaAAAA
AAAAAA
ME ENCANTAN TODOS
I love you
Dios, la voz de Alex es hipnótica, tiene algo que me hace querer escucharla por siempre.
DIOS MIOO,,,,MEMUEROOOO

👌👌
PERFECTION!!!!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩
extremely good sound quality + Arctic Monkeys :  endless pleasure
The terrestrial quality of this album, and the lunar aura of Tranquility, are really continuing this journey
Es insano lo mucho que me gusta esta bandaaaa. Que me encantan un mundo, madre mía ❤️‍🔥
Finally. The Last Shadow Puppets.
If The Car is anything like a follow up from TBHAC then I'm absolutely not complaining. This sound is fantastic.
Love this song ❤
I'm lost for words.  The music is absolutely touching.  The cinematography is insanely beautiful.  And together they make a masterpiece ❤️
This has such monumental levels of big dick energy
AAAH! OMG 😻💓
Não é pra mim
O hype pra esse disco novo dos rapazes tá cada vez mais alto 👏👏👏
You will be the best what happens this year, probably the next one too. THIRST! It's alive.
WHY IS IT SO GOOD??
ALEXANDER DAVID BOWIE TURNER 🌐⚡
I miss you rock in roll :'(
TE AMO ALEX, TE AMO
DIOS, LOS AMOOOO LOS AMO
NO TE CREO, NO TE CREOOOOO
Damm I was not expecting that shift into the light bouncy instrumentals, I love it
PERDÓN ESTABA EN LA ESCUELA, AMO LA CANCIÓN, ARCTIC MONKEYS>>>>>> TODAS SU CANCIONES DE LO MAS ESTA CANCIÓN>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  TODA CREACIÓN DE ARCTIC MONKEYS ❤️❤️❤️
Uffff>>>>>
My heart AAAAAAAAAAA ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
Circles and round objects
My day is perfect when Arctic Monkeys and Paramore released a new song.
NOO ESTABA EN LA ESCUELA CUANDO SALIÓ 😭
Arctic Monkeys tickets in the morning, new song in the afternoon. What a beautiful day 🙏🏻
I love it! 😻
Dios es hermosa
great production, songwriting lacks everything tho
this is some david bowie level music/video
this is fucking awful , even worse the tranquility , shame , but I suppose they've had their time.
I feel like I'm watching some 80's movie, damn how I love these guys I'm really looking forward to the album, I'm glad they continued with this concept, I loved it! ❤️
If Radiohead, David Bowie and Queen had a child it would be this song
❣️🤧
MANO  PEQUEPE  Que música incrível, que voz incrível, que instrumental lindo. A voz do Alex é linda e super combina com a música, eu amei
Alex’s voice 🫶
thank you so much for keeping me alive with your music you guys are so important to me
🥰🥰🥰🥰
I’m really happy for those of you who love this new era of AM. I really am. I hope these two singles grow on me some day, but as of right now… not feeling it. The production on this track is amazing, the video is beautiful.
These videos really have something magical to them :) Even though I've always prefered fast paced and catchy songs I still respect the effort and emotions put into this <3
it's giving me david bowie
Well this music video just set a new bar
This video really reminds me of my favorites of theirs, just a totally new take on it. It's not often a new album feels both totally new to me, while still keeping what originally pulled me in there.
phenomenal tune my lord, great to have you back!
é podcast meno? its podcast little?
Mano, tá incrível
What happened with Alex's voice😍
I hear the Bowie influence here and so does everyone else.
Ahhhhh ti amo
🎧🎧😎😎🎵🔉🔊🎶
I want to marry Alex Turner

Zzzzzzzz
an art.
ha!
Comment after the first 30 seconds- Do you remember a moment in which you 1st time heard Curtis Mayfield? That's that moment here...
Can we have artic monkeys from AM back?
Am i the only one who can hear the sample from "stuck on the puzzle (intro version)" on the intro to this song?
aaaaaaaaa... Omg! This is awesomeee! Congratulations guys for this 🥰

Se debería llamar ALEX TURNER Y LOS ARCTIC MONKEYS, porque no deja relucir a los otros integrantes en fin, un seguidor menos...!
*Literalmente el 99% de las personas ignoran este mensaje: “Dios guarde a tu familia y a ti de toda enfermedad* 🙏!.
Body Paint Lyrics ❤  [Verse 1] For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed, to lie in Do your time traveling through the tanning booth So you don’t let the sun catch you crying  [Chorus] So predictable, I know what you're thinking  [Verse 2] My teeth are beating and my knees are weak It's as if there’s something up with the wiring You can poke your head behind the mountain peak It don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding  [Chorus] So predictable I know what you're thinking  [Bridge] I'm watching your every move I feel the tears are coming on It won't be long It won't be long  [Refrain] Straight from the cover shoot There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I’m keeping on my costume And calling it a writing tool And if you’re thinking of me I'm probably thinking of you  [Refrain] There’s still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face So predictable I know what you’re thinking Ooh, hah, yeah
las vibes que me da a david bowie esto son gigantes
One of the best videos so far
This is amazing. Sends me through the everlasting psychic door of solace. 💛💛💛 everything about this. Such sweet vibe.
And again, when I need them, they're here
No lo sé Rick
Gracias x tanto
GG!
I was literally on my way out of the door to class when I YouTube notified me. Blasted it all the way to campus
Jeff
This should be on a 007
I LOVE U
Que emoción de tan solo pensar que esta canción es solo una pizca del nuevo álbum ❤
Sorry, but this song is extremely average at best. A song lacking any real tune/melody or anything catchy. A bit like U2 of the last decade or so when a band runs out of good tunes.
This is probably going to be their best album hands down. Yes the old Era was awesome but their change in sound is incredible I wonder what the rest of the album will sound like. I'm buying this album
the way i gasped when i saw a new mv was out
Ah yes, time traveling through the tanning booth. Thank you *Alex.*
Real music
Gracias Arctic Monkeys,  ahora será un paseo en auto
Esse cara é incrível
WTF?! This is the most marvelous thing I’ve heard in years 😍 #arcticmonkeysneverfailtosurprise
the tarot card is that of the fool and reminds me of iggi from jojo's:((
this reminded me of the last shadow puppets
Eu tô tão feliz de testemunhar esse clipe maravilhoso 20 min após ele ter estreado. Simplesmente fantástico!
Definitely Bowie vibes
4 years of waiting for this flop.. disappointing. Both released tracks don’t compare to anything on TBHC. I hope the rest of the album blows me away, but I’m starting to worry a bit.
🥰😍😍
😍😍🫶
What happened to Alex's voice? sounds awful ...
Alex misturou a atmosfera do EP Submarine com os violinos do segundo álbum do The Last Shadow Puppets, o piano do Tranquility Base, os solos do Humbug, e cá temos essa obra-prima. Hypadíssimo.
my lover
Watching and listening to this for the first time in my study hall trying to stay quiet was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do omfg
No hay forma que me canse de escucharte Alex, Gracias por existir.
Arctic Monkeys have enough good tunes in their setlist they could literally poop into a microphone with reverb on for a few songs n get away with it, which seems to be their approach last album and upcoming. Disappointing as heck.
They made this for the film girlies
Hoy soñé que un señor que vendía motos abría la puerta del frente de mi casa y entonces mi perrita se escapaba, pero, apareció Alex en una moto pequeña y me miró, él pasaba con unos auriculares Sony lleno de stikers y me señalaba la perra. Hicimos contacto visual por varios minutos, todo fue caótico. Mi perra se escapó, Alex apareció en moto, el señor que vendía motos era un estafador.  Fin de mi sueño.
Very Beatles I love it
I can’t believe I have a chance to live on the same planet as they do 😻🥰
looking forward to november to finally hear them live 🛐
extraordinary
Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino - gold version 2022

I miss the old songs
Brilliant
when you go to scare your grandma, but then remember she has a heart problem. 4:00- 4:05
aight i fuck with this
im in love
I do love his new voice, but I feel like this song would have made my knees weaker with his old, younger voice of the earlier albums.
Why is it gives me Queen’s vibes????
It sounds like a soundtrack of a movie, wonderful btw. Alex's voice is amazing and incredibly calms everyone down.
This is so artistic and experimental, it just isn't the arctic monkeys from years ago, this is something totally and completelly..  New...
It's giving comfort. It's giving expertise. It's giving sheer talent. It's giving confidence. It's giving know-how.
Me gusta tu voz tu estilo indie y sobre todo tu imagen con traje la vdd que son la mejor banda gracias INTERPOL 🥰🥰
NEW OBSSESSION. NEW OBSESSION.  NEW OBSESSION.
BRO WTH, YOU GUYS ARE LITERALLY THE BEST. this is so fucking good.
Tranqullity part II
amazing.
súper temazo
sempre vou amar Arctic
The best song they’ve done in years
THIS IS SO FREAKING AMAZING, the perfection of this song is superior
❤❤❤❤
increíble que a pesar de los años alex sigue teniendo una joya de voz
The song starts at 3:00 , thank me later
Mirrorball gave me Beatles vibes, but it wasn't strong. This one though, textbook Lennon song. Crazy sounds and arrangements. Absolutely in love with it.
I LOVE US
JUST AMAZING, I LOVE IT !!
the power of them guitar solo
4am, Wife just gave birth to our 3rd baby (girl 🥰)  Listening to this is utter bliss, Thank you 🙏
Orgulloso de haber madurado junto a arctic monkeys
Viejos sabrosos
Remember they used to be good
3:59 HAH!
Great song and incredible cinematography. I love how the music and the video match, even when they don't, which make things not so predictable as we were thinking.
A masterpiece
im in love fuck off
ugh the boys are back how i missed them so
both song and video are masterpieces
Legendary. What a time to be alive!
The ending got me levitating 💀
This is it
god
so cooooooooooool
simplesmente f0da
What a fucking classic already.
THIS IS CINEMA
amo mas este estilo desde que estuvo en the last shadows algo cambio y quedo perfecto.
That Steenbeck doesnt look quite right
INCREÍBLE VOZ DE DE ALEX. HERMOSA CANCIÓN.  Aunque esto es THE LAST SHADOW PUPPETS que le vamos a hacer, esta increíble
beautiful
Se la dedico a mi pequeñita
los amo
i love this too much
Es Arte,hasta que mueran

Hooo
ARCTIC MONKEYS 🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐❤❤❤🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐❤❤❤🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐
Perfect. The cinematography. The song.
This is like tiny dancer but best ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
WOWOWOWOWOWO I LOVE ARTIC MONKEYS
Such beautiful photography, it's worth it for the opening scene
i cannot wait for the album this is a BANGER absolute masterpiece 🤌🏻
Is this borderline prog? Sounds like elo.
DIOS QUE BUENA CANCIÓN, Y DEL VIDEO NI QUE HABLAR, A MASTERPIECE
❤
So unfortunately that Bowie isn't alive to hear this.
Este disco me tiene muy intrigado
Can't wait to hear this live 😍😍
It's not a song, it's an art.
The song and the video is perfect
another masterpiece... speechless
OMG this song is actually amazing als vocals are amazing
alex’s voice is on another level. so good!!
Canción toda espectacular 💗
OK BITCH IM HERE
BEAUTIFUL REALLY I LOVE IT
¡Dios! Escucharlo con audífonos es.... 📈📈 Amoooo!
Can’t wait for the crybabies to comment how this is not as good as first 2 albums or AM.
es como para bailar con la chica que tanto te gusta en una cena romantica
Pra mim as letras das músicas do novo álbum explica muito bem o rumo  do estilo musical que o Alex explicitando. Ele como no primeiro single “ there'd better be a mirrorball”, começa a dizer a vocês( fãs, a maioria infelizmente começou no AM), para não se emocionarem pois o ontem está vazando no telhado, lá fora, o Arctic Monkeys do passado ficou lá fora e isso não é novidade. Ele se passar por um velho tolo com músicas românticas e melodias lentas é a expressão do seu humor de agora. Se você quer acompanhar ele até o carro (The Car , 2023. Novo álbum) saibam que foi com um coração pesado que foi escrito essas letras. Não é uma surpresa alguma. Que linda  e honesta fase. Eu que acompanho desde 2006, quando tinha apenas 16 e eles ainda conseguem surpreender e emocionar. Como uma viagem no tempo da nossa vida e amadurecimento. As minhas expectativas para esse álbum não poderiam ser melhores. Que o que tenha no coração possa ser sempre expressado na forma mais bonita da arte.
Essa voz do Alex é incomparável
I love those transitions, and the voice... it's perfect
Arte. Que maravilla.
holy dhit 😭
Absolute Beatles feel. Cannot wait for this album
mira esa cinematografia papa
fell off cant lie
Please come back to America. We miss you.
It's so Beatles, Bowie and TLSP! This is absolutely beautiful! I'm literally having goosebumps listening to this song. ❤
😭😭
This cinematography is outstanding
Oh my god!!!!
Crying, screaming, pissing, shitting, etc. Just what the dog days-fall transition needed. Will be on repeat in my ears for months
26th time watching this
Levito escuchando a Alex.
his voice is so lovely
tua voz é arte alex! 💘
this is art. pure art.
God damn this is a vibe
Oof I feel like there was definitely symbolism
😮😊❤ I love You  Light Kooky Windy Moody Cheeky Mine!  and I am pretty sure it will only ever make sense to us exclusively.   Truly yours, Desert Mound Canyon
Alex Turner looking like Ace Ventura
SO GOOD
Wow. Just wow.
Search this in YouTube Yellow
Me encanta la nueva temática que tienen en sus canciones ❤
tbh first 2 sec of the lyrics is weird but the rest of it is incredible
Todo empezó con 505 ,siguió con "I bet look you on the dance floor",luego "Potion Aproching" y ahora vamos por body paint ✨💌💐
Nice
!
those high notes oh my god 👌
this is cinema
Absolutely love
Mi Vida Evoluciona Junto Con su música. amo Estas Melodías Esa letra Esto Es Arte🖤🤍
music was just invented,,,,,,,,,,
DIOS PERO QUE BUEN VIDEO ME LO VOY A TATUAR
AHHHHHH
ALEX TE AMAMOS DEMASIADO 😭
GRACIAS ARCTIC MONKEYS POR DARLE SENTIDO A MI JODIDA VIDA
Oh por Dios!!! Valió la pena esperarlos. La voz de Alex sigue dando vueltas en mi cabeza y no quiero que desaparezca, sí que enamora 💞
Alex's singing voice is smoother than a baby's Bum❣️❣️❣️❣️😘💋
QUE ME BESE EL DEL VIDEO 😭
what the hell happened to The Arctic Monkeys? gutted
cool song
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH MUERO MUERO MUERO DIOS ARCTIC MONKEYS SON JODIDAMENTE BUENAS SUS CANCIONES LAS AMO 😭✨💐💌
así sin avisar? xd
love loveee
As usual AM pulling So good songs
Your timbre is so very special. And this David Bowie style kills me. Congratulations for such a beautiful song💜🤘⭐
I love this so much! Best what I've heard from them since Tranquility Base began
THE CAR IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THEIR BEST ALBUMS I CAN FEEL IT
The build of this one really makes the guitars so satisfying when they enter the equation.
kinda reminds me of that mini mansions song in wich alex participate
Yawn
Esse tem tudo pra ser o melhor álbum da banda
Está hermosa la canción 🤍
in the last "so predictable, i know what you're thinking" the guitar makes the same melody of the voice, like predicting whats coming on
I like the new places Alex is taking his voice on this new album
rodney smith reference in the man with airplane...masterpiece
It sucks that they stopped making music after Favorite Worst Nightmare.
WTF WTF THIS IS PERFECT I’M SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW
QUEEE QIFNWID QUE BUEN TEMA DIOS
This is everything and so much more
es literalmente la cancion perfecta por dios
Joder, hoy ganó el cine y la música *procede a fumar*
I love the Arctic monkeys ❤
Este me gustó más que el anterior 👌🏼
LOS AMO CONCHETUMARE
loved seeing this live
La letra es perfecta...
Can't wait to see them live again!!
Hermosa canción y vídeo...cuerdas en ambos singles largados, se nota por donde viene la mano de este nuevo disco. Muy lindo lo que se viene
I love it :)
Melhor vídeoclipe da banda
I really hope Alex is going through  his lost in LA, coke nightmare phase because at least it will be a good story and when he looks back on this insipid waste of time it maybe inspires some great tunes in the future... That's the most positive take I can give right now, I feel for the band but I'm most sorry for the drummer because he's a monster and it must be slightly embarrassing to be in these videos when it's basically an Alex solo homage to Hawley... Nice guitar sound near the end tho
We get it mate, you love the 70s
Not my cup of tea at all
This video is a masterclass, change my mind
La amé totalmente <3
Tha'ts great
Diablo coño ahora e!
Is it me? or it sounds like the song we were all waiting for their great comeback?
alex baby
I'm literally listening to this on repeat its amazing
His voice courted me, proposed, married me, got a mortgage, got me pregnant, filmed the birth, and raised our child
Not my cup of tea
This has to be the most gorgeous song I've ever heard.
Mate, I Think, I Like This Album a Lot🤫
hermoso, esto es arte, espero con ansias el album, no decepcionan nunca <3 los amo
No digo que antes no, PERO...  AHORA SÍ. Que temazo!
F-ing genius, yet again.
Some time ago I bet you looked good at the dance floor! Now it’s all cinematic 😢 I miss the monkeys!
i cant...its perfect kyaaa
no buenooooo
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Just Amazing
I cant even tell how incredible this song is. And the video. It took me a few seconds to love it. But I do. Both of the latest songs are so much stuck in my head. More than other songs. Please never stop doing whatever you want and making whatever kind of music you love 👌🏼
Dislike
REVIVIÓ LA MUSICA
♥️
unforgettable
Todo me recuerda a SUBMARINE....
This vibe looks like David Bowie to me...
oh my god, THEY'VE DONE IT AGAIN!
AMO. Esperando el 21 de oct con ansias.
This song is beautiful. Alex is beautiful.
que soninho que me deu (de novo)
sending kisses to the art director :***
Excelente el video y canción, arte puro.
LOS AMOO ✨️💕
This might well become my favourite AM album
This slaps 🤭
not just the perfection of the song but also the video clip 😍❤
La cagó
Arctic monkeys still in the 70's. 👌
Essa música está incrível
This voice and melody is definitely Arctic Monkeys.
this mv omg 🔥
The modern day 'Day in The life'
Nah brev this shit=slaps
some serious gourmet shit, every fucking time...
Arte, simplemente arte
🛐
Vid and music are just dope👌
A surprise to be sure.. but a welcome one
eu só amo esses caras
te amo Arctic Monkeys.
unreal ❤️❤️
I love this!!
Im in love😍
ALEX TURNER ENTRE MAS VIEJO MAS BUENO TE AMO
Nice
I feel kinda weird about this album coming up.  Both songs so far have been good-to-great (imo), and you have to judge things for what they are rather than what you want them to be. In that regard, I'm happy Alex is making the music he feels best prepared to make.    But...I feel like for a band that famously kept things moving, it feels like Alex is a little stuck in an era, between this, TBHC & TLSP2. Don't get me wrong, there's obviously some difference between this music and the last album....but it doesn't really pack a surprise, does it? We all would've predicted more longe-y grandiose music with less hooks. And given it's been over 5 years since TBHC, I kinda feel glum about that lack of change.  I guess this is where Alex goes from here on out, and all our dads will be onboard with it. To me, it signals losing their 'edge' (i wasn't expecting to suddenly start strumming downwards quickly again or anything, but still), but at least the quality is still real good. Certainly beats Alex making music that he's not enthused about.
Que perfeição 🤩😍🤩😍🤩
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDSfRcCOsg8
This is beatles and radiohead
He has rly aged😢
Oh wait they just released a song?? : o 4 HOURS AGO??
THIS ONE HITS WAY TOO HARD
What a video!! Kubrick influence?? Four stars out of five
Everything I've heard from the album so far has been unreal! I'm so excited for this album, I just know it's going to be perfect. And I'm completely in love with the aesthetics
I love Mirrorball, but somehow this doesnt do it for me. Perhaps itll grow on me like "She Looks Like Fun" did.
Música para Soundtrack...! 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
like wine
I love love love this song
Cant wait to buy my concert tickets tomorrow at 9am 🫶✨
LOS AMOOOOO
OMG is this song is definitely beautiful long live Arctic Monkeys
Monkeys are pure art, pure gold. They keep evolving without loosing they’re essence and style. They are making a more sophisticated and polished rock 👌
Is this (3:19) an evangelion reference?
It's not Arctic monkeys anymore, it's TLSP
[Verse 1] For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed, to lie in Do your time traveling through the tanning booth So you don’t let the sun catch you crying  [Chorus] So predictable, I know what you're thinking  [Verse 2] My teeth are beating and my knees are weak It's as if there’s something up with the wiring You can poke your head behind the mountain peak It don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding [Chorus] So predictable I know what you're thinking  [Bridge] I'm watching your every move I feel the tears are coming on It won't be long It won't be long  [Refrain] Straight from the cover shoot There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I’m keeping on my costume And calling it a writing tool And if you’re thinking of me I'm probably thinking of you  [Refrain] There’s still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face So predictable I know what you’re thinking Ooh, hah, yeah
god
Fuck y aún no superaba mirrorball.....
Total waste of one of the most talented bands of this era.  Was hoping the loungey garbage was just a one off vanity project, but this sounds exactly the same as Tranquility.  Utterly disappointing.  Helders must be bored out of his mind.
🛐🛐
Good
Es un privilegio vivir en la época de los Arctic Monkeys. Esto sí que es buena música. ❤️🎶🎸
this is a 10/10, can't wait for the record
Pinche rolita espectacular y eso que solo he escuchado 30 segundos
Póngale condón a el álbum que se viene ahhhh

Aahhhhh queeeee
The video, the song ,everything is just a whole emotion of its own
Such David Bowie and Mott the Hoople vibes. Immaculate
Yikes. Well this is a hell no for  me.
In under 200k yesssss
My my Alex you can predict my thoughts! Wasn't expecting the falsetto but after a few plays on my walk, this is fantastic fresh and progressive. Keep the slick, sexiness comin' fella.
I just wanna say: wow. You guys get better with time. Love your music. Keep going! 💓
The aesthetic of this videoclip is perfection. Love it!
Wow I’m in love with this song!! ^^
When the world needed them the most, they came back
I don't know why but this gave me star treatment vibes. I think I like it.
DADDY

This is passionfruit for my ears.
💜
why are so many of the comments in spanish
i like the song but affff it sounds like hotel and casino the new album is gonna be hotel and casino parte 2 type of album its nothing new so far, i miss at least an album like AM, Matt use to beat the shit out of the drums on past albums i feel sad for him that he cant do proper drum beats anymore, its just all slow pace drums im pretty sure he most be boring for a guy that did so much good drum beats on the past
Otra gran canción, está excelente
I'M CRYING
Still effected from cinema
him voice es perfect, love u Alex
when are we gonna have the old AM back? this sounds like a Elton John on depression.
this song is **chef kiss**
The intro is like «Stuck on the puzzle», I love it
I M CRYING😭😭😭😭❤😭❤😭❤😭❤😭
this is beautiful I cant wait for the rest of the album.
First 3 albums were awesome.Then they fell off big Time became amercanized and its a dam shame still have the classics to listen to
Another beautiful song

No way someone say that their new LP disappointed them, it’s even better that I expected!
A Day in the life
This is literally, literally, the best music video i have ever seen. And then you combine it with a 10/10 song. Jesus Christ. These guys are Dangerous with how good they are
this is masterpiece
OHMYFUCKINGGOD THIS SONG IS PERFECT
me encantoooooo
Alex mi religión🫣🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐
AM album fans why are you crying again? 😂
Simplemente una obra maestra ,la voz de Alex es grandiosa estoy ansiosa de escuchar el nuevo álbum
The 2nd most impactful thing to happen to me this month is watching their new Cinematic Music videos  & the 1st was seeing them Live 🥺😭❤️‍🔥   Me han cambiado la vida desde el primer día que los escuché <3
Matt Helders looks so fucking fed up. He's so much more talented on drums than this, it's so sad to see that potential wasted :(
i could write ESSAYS about this music video… for example the first scene references hitchcock’s north by northwest, but the whole video is also infused with a kubrickesque, slightly surreal feel
This is an absolute masterpiece I just loved every second of this and I can’t wait for The Car
AHHH SCREAMING HAIR PULLING THIS IS SO GOOD
3:37 As if there wasn´t much Bowie in it already. What a song!
<3
Me ENCANTA!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
DIOSMIO QUE YA SAQUEN TODO EL MAODITO ALBUM
Los amooooooo enserio!!!!! Cambiaron mi vidaaaaaa :'3
Complete perfection.
WOW
The music video is so good!!!
Is it just me who prefers it when he doesn't sing high pitched? It might just not be my taste in music, but I think the second part of the song if you call it that is brilliant. I just feel the start is too slow and not really my thing but then it turns into something so much better. I'm sure I'll warm up to it like TBH+C though
I loved it 🤍😀
❤️
AAAAAAAA 😩💘
The rise in my serotonin levels caused by this incredible song is indescribable.
Asi es como se hace musica
The evolution of A.M's sound and vision is pure joy to behold. Loved the Bowie bolt x
So soft
Es increíble la banda y el tremendo artista que es Alex Turner, y lo estamos disfrutando en nuestros tiempos, enserio Arctic Monkeys no tiene comparación
I love it and am indifferent about it at the same time! I think it’s a very unique song n of course vocals are amazing
Fascinante.
❤❤❤❤
Perfeito! ❤️❤️
maro io vi amo
Isso aqui é ARTE!!!
If only the last minute was the whole song
Fico muito fodaaaaaa 🍷🗿🇧🇷
At least this wasn’t as big of a disappointment than the unexpected 2017 sound
i'm so in love with arctic monkeys they never make a bad songs fr😫
lyrics ✨✨  For a master of deception and subterfuge You’ve made yourself quite the bed, to lie in Do your time traveling through the tanning booth So you don’t let the sun catch you crying  So predictable, I know what you’re thinking   My teeth are beating and my knees are weak It’s as if there’s something up with the wiring You can poke your head behind the mountain peak It don’t have to mean that you’ve gone into hiding  So predictable I know what you’re thinking  Watching your every move I feel the tears are coming on It won’t be long It won’t be long  Straight from the cover shoot There’s still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I’m keeping on my costume And calling a writer too And if you’re thinking of me I’m probably thinking of you  There’s still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face  So predictable I know what you’re thinking

The cinematography omfggg 😭❤‍🔥I LOVE the video, song, Alex' voice & everything. Also love that they all are in the video. These guys don't age.
They came back like they never left. Amazing song as always!
Parece mais tlsp que arctic, mesmo assim, som é mil vezes inferior ao último, everything that you've come to expect...
I’m on my way home after school and this is the first thing I see, this is amazing
They’re better than this. I get what they’re trying to do but they should’ve explored the Suck It and See/AM sound more.
Tudo lindo 🕺🏽♥️
A visual masterpiece
Es muy relajante todo Muy buena calidad
I'm excited for this new album 👍
The cinematography feels like one of those French New Wave movies from the 50s where there's a narrator set to random images that tell a bigger story. Very subtle nod.
🎶AH🎶
Alex, você é o maior!!
Could easily be part of the Submarine soundtrack.
♥️
2:19 HE'S A LITERAL PRINCE WTF
God this song is just fucking perfect 😩 listened to it like 10 times already
👌 Perfect
Temazoooooo
This is so so so soooooo good!! Love it😀👌😍

I just love you so much, god
carai fi o pai tá brabo hein

Regalo de cumple de parte del Alex
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Every single one of there songs is just like perfection
This is going to be a very interesting album!!
SON UNOS GENIOS!!!! LOS AMOOOO :’)
La voz de Alex turner Diosmio
1:40 feels like paul’s verse (second part) of ‘a day in a life’ by the beatles
im yor biggest fan
bring back the old arctic monkeys, this is poor
meu Deus eu amo esses caras
me atrapaste, si es cine
Remember how good Arctic Monkeys used to be?  Matt Helders is wasted on this drivel
This album has something that I would like to explain but I don't know how, I just know that it will be something out of this world...
Absolute vortex of hyper artistry. Needs award for best video.
OMG!!!!!! Another boring song by Arctic Monkeys O___O
hypnotic
PERFECT song! Never fails to impress me
This epicness is a whole new level
❤️❤️❤️
los amo con toda mi puta vida
o número de brasileiros aqui me faz acreditar que o AM é uma banda nacional, só pode ser
Go on bring your Go-kart magic over here conmigo 🥺😭❣️🤍❣️🖤❣️
this gave me a lot of David Bowie and The Beatles vibes, it's totally amazing, the monkeys just keep growing up more, this album is gonna be a beast
JUST WOW!!
Ahhhhh los amooooooOOOoo😍❤️
🇧🇷💚
😭😭😭😭😭😭
The metaphors in the lyrics and video are insane. I’m going to stop there, though. I hope the people that  know not to talk about it. Like Fight Club.

David Bowie's influence full on display right here!
outro is amazing
💛
I already love this song
I’m sorry but …this AM is new Beatles
Puta madre
Sinto muito adultos com gosto musical de adolescente... Esse caminho que eles entraram não tem volta.
SON MI VIDA ENTERA NO SE PUEDE AMAR TANTO A UNA BANDAAA
The reliance on nostalgia is getting annoying, how many music vids like this do we need and this includes Louise’s vids, but the music is good and that is all that matters. I can’t wait to get my copy. Worth every dollar and more.
Literal masterpiece

"A day in the life" Vibes ♡♡♡
I love how every one of their albums seems to be something they really love, care about, and put time into, rather than just a cash grab.
Good song but I need more rock
HE DO BE SPINNIN THO 4:14
HIS VOICE
los Artic Monkeys son una banda top ten mundial, pero ya desde el suck it and see la depresión lo está volviendo un viejo joven. vamos reacción un poco de música mas alegres digamoslo así
Gives me old era Arctic Monkeys songs vibes.
The Beatles prepared me to this moment ♥️
Essa música tá incrível, aumentou ainda mais o meu hype pro álbum que tá pra vir.
INCREDIBLE
AH!! ES PERFECTAA!♡♡
Can’t wait for the whole thing!!
THEY NEVER DISAPPOINT, THIS WILL BE THE ALBUM OF THE YEAR!!!
/GRITO FANBOY

What a song. Already obsessed. Major Beatles and Bowie vibes, and that Shine on You Crazy Diamond guitar solo 🔥
Sois la mejor cosa del mundo
YESSSS
OMG
Play Pink Floyd's High hopes before this, you may thank me later.
VIOLIN!!! :P
It’s like the perfect mix between David Bowie and the Beatles it’s just incredible. The cinematography, the lyrics, his voice, the instruments it’s literally just PERFECT. Thank you for this.  ❤️
ESTOY EMOCIONADQ
Alex's voice is magical ✨
Tranquility Base hater here. Everything out of the new album is great so far.
this is real cinema
Hoy ganó la humanidad!
These two singles released are better than than the entire 'Tranquility Base' album
hotel's songs with arctic monkeys
love it
Fueron los mejores 4 minutos de mi vida 🧡
The most gorgeous voice with the most gorgeous video WITH THE MOST GORGEOUS BAND MEMBERS. Pure talent. I am obsessed already
Why does this kind of remind me a of a Beatles song, particularly the breakdown in the middle
goooddddd
hassiktir
Los amo, gracias por existir.
Ayer Paramore, hoy los macacos arcticos. Ha revivido la música.
Uhuuuuuu 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
SCREAMED WHEN I SAW THIS
Frank Zappa vibes
I really hope i get the tickets for next year 😭
It’s just genius isn’t it.
This song takes me back to the good old days
Last week during this song I yelled that I'm thinking of you Alex. I haven't stopped 😣💫❣️
Beautiful.   I don't care if I get fired for watching this and commenting at work, totally worth it.
Outstanding Cinematography However I miss rock n rolll ..please come back
Hoy revivio la música hermano
Woah.
<33333
No album same as the last.  Will always love them.  They continue to impress
perfection xx
¡Me encantó! Espero  con mucha emoción por el álbum completo😊🎶💕 y poder verlos en vivo (actualizo: lo que  fue una realidad en octubre del 2023 en Foro Sol)😊❤ Me gustó mucho  la canción y todo este asunto cinematográfico del video🎬🎞📽
i miss my ex he used to listen to am and keshi 😭😭
Musical masterpiece

💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
So Tranquility Base meets later Beatles I suppose?
Nunca me hartaré de este grupo 🔥🔥
🧡
30 seconds in and I have goosebumps all over
My fav from The Car till now ❤
They did it again, what a masterpiece this is becoming!
Music won today
Really really I love these moment
LA MEJOR CANCIÓN DE LOS MONOS EN SU HISTORIA
This song is absolutely incredible and don’t even get me started on the cinematography… a blessing for my eyes.  Once you start falling in love with their music, there’s no going back. Thank you for this masterpiece ❤️❤️❤️
♥!!!
oh baby its coming
This is absolutely fantastic. Quite possibly their masterpiece.
Los Arctic Monkeys son arte ;)
Their transition into The Kubriks is complete. Great video. The song, not so much
💌‼️🫶
AMO ESTO
Amamos
I really like that film related sound and visual style.
Esta música nos la ponía Diosito cuando nos sentaba en una mesa laaarga a todos sus angelitos en el cielo
how i wish i could be alex turner
Sounds boring and uninspired
No puedo olvidar lo increíble que es esta canción y video. Todo es simplemente PERFECTO.
Mastercard logo ?
I love all these new songs they’re coming up with ❤
Justo como esperaba que resultará! Y si estás pensando en mí. Probablemente estoy pensando en ti.
:*
Unfuckingbelievable
No matter what they sing about, their songs always give me a feeling like heaven
Arctic Monkeys died with AM. Matt Helders the best drummer in the world on last album was killed. Now they just spit on his grave :*(
cool
Лучшие, Велком бек
the silhouettes!!!!! SO GOOD
Peny Lane vibes.
Aaaaaaaaaaa finalmente
lf communist kawaii gf uwu
Awesome, the monkeys going back in time, getting their Bowie side.
Healing the world they really are again.
pero que buen temazo.
Queria muito estar em seu show em Curitiba meu sonho , mas estou operada em recuperação ótima melodia amo sua mente muita luz❤️
Terrible, just terrible. Has nothing to do with Arctic Monkeys. The last album was garbage and this is a new low. Terrible.
Amazing 🤩
I love u guys
Really not a fan of this new direction they're going in musically
I think I am in love again with this song
got me crying for no reason.
perfeição
Masterpiece .
Nunca decepcionam 🫶🏽
THEYRE BACK
This is phenomenal.
Absolutely awesome song.
aghhh<33

Best birthday present ever
SLAY

Arte, en una palabra. Alex, tiene una voz bellísima. La canción es hermosa.  Ni enterada que hoy iban a sacar una canción, me sorprendió.  Ya se acerca el lanzamiento del álbum, estoy muy emocionada.
Every word, every part of this fuckng video is a fuckng work of art. How I love you guys...
Que bueno que son parte de mi vida. Me encantan.
That ending is an absolute banger
Beatles/Bowie vibes off the chart. This is incredible
David Alexander Bowie Turner! Sublime!
ISSO TA MUITO BOOOOMMM
Giving me David Bowie vibes! Very nice!
🔥🔥🔥
I absolutely loved this song. Arctic Monkeys never disappoint. I love how cinematic this video is and Alex’s voice is so soothing. Can’t wait to see them live on November 🤍
❤️
Bloody brilliant 🤩
This has such a Bowie feel to it I can barely conain myself it's GORGEOUS 💖

Alex Fucking Turner😘🖤🖤
I like how my music taste progresses the same as monkeys album genres throughout the years

the beginnig...stuck in the puzzle vibes
Simply amazing as always, i am honored to live in this era just to listen to their amazing music
eu te amo eu te amo eu te amo
Dios porque son tan buenos aaa >/////<
Não é ruim,mas eu preferia o artic Monkeys dos grandes sucessos como ru mine e por aí vai,com aquela pegada mais rock mesmo...
this made me so emotional and i don't know why
I wanna hear it over and over again
Alex Turner brincando de Chris Maker
It feels like a film that was nominated for an oscar
I see a lot of abbey road influence here.
one of the worst vocalists alive imo
desde hace tiempo todas sus canciones me suenan igual incluyendo esta :S
I am officially in love with Alex and his voice
This new era of arctic monkeys is on another level in terms of music production. I love it❤
ARTE
We got the last dose of 2022 🥲
I love everything: the music, the lyrics,  the Vintage look, the Beatles touch... Alex's voice... I'm in love! ❤
I love this song 💗
Wow. That just total blew me away. I think I witnessed a moment
Me encanta
SON LOS MEJORES MIVIDAS
ESTA BIEN BUENA LA CANCION 😻😻😻😻😻
QUE OBRA DE ARTE
LOS AMO MONOS ARTICOS
This is a beautiful record.  What a delivery Fucking lovely
simplemente, perfecto
Temazo!
Estoy enamorada de esta era
OMGGG YES
Where's the old monkeys gone 😭😭
Dear. God.  Actually Dear. Alex.

This video is incredible and I just feel the connection with the music, it’s a bit less rock like for my taste but I still vibe with it. Loving this album so far!!
Te amooo Alex❤🇵🇪
absolutely amazing. I can't believe how clever the first verse is!!
the only thing missing is Miles Kane
W
😭😭
incredible as always
🔥♥️
Fuck. unbelievable good. that surpasses all my expectations!
Anyone thinks they sound more like radiohead these days? Or is it just me?
beautiful song to listen in the afternoon uwu
Wow
Wow this is so amazing
les amo
Brilliant
I can say this is a highest level of an art combining a song with the music video (also TBBAM mv). Shout out to the cinematic visuals that is undeniably entertaining, and of course, the Arctic Monkeys itself. Enjoy it while it lasts baby, it has been such a joy to live in their era ❤️❤️
scenes givin so much SEVERANCE vibes
Flawless as always...
I LOVE ITTTT
How is it possible everything they make to be a masterpiece 😩. I love them so much
Such beautiful photography, it’s worth it for the opening scene!
Fuck me, this should have been another Alex Turner solo album.  RIP T'Arctics
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG I LOVE IT
Te amo arctic monkeys, te conocí por una persona muy especial❤️❤️❤️
Someone's been on a Bowie binge lately
i can see these doing a James Bond tune with this new style.
This just in. another arctic monkeys song is once again banger
They all still look AMAZING. They perfectly pull off such a full spectrum of looks… all the way from punk rockers to suave gentlemen in outfits from the 60s. Amazing.
Best band in the world 💯
I love this for no reason.
0:15 Reference to Sonic Youth‘s Daydream Nation Album?
Simplesmente uma obra de arte!
Really liking these new songs so far
Efectivamente... los monos son CINE
I love this band too much
This = Masterpiece.
Masterpiece 😍
this guy used to wanna be one of the strokes but now he wanna be the stanley kubrick
Alex tu me quitas mi heterosexualidad 😪
Se siente bien ver crecer a mis bandas favoritas de la pubertad. El sonido sí que ha cambiado, pero vaya que siguen sonando bien.
this is perfection. i love all of their style,s but this one is so them. i’m happy they’re able to just 'do music’ regardless of people’s opinion.
Actimonki tamo
This song is mind blowing im in love
It's not that I think this music is bad, it's actually incredibly well crafted, but this just isn't my kind of vibe. If fell into a coma after AM, woke up present day and someone played Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino and these two new songs I would just assume it's some new Alex Turner side project.
i like this a lot more than There’d better Be A Mirror ball. this songs only been out for 2 hours. saw the notification when i was in spanish and had to wait 2 hours for it 💔
que beatlesco se pone desde el 1:38, es hermoso
Arctic monkeys 2012: sexoooo Arctic monkeys 2022: hay que trasmitir paz
Scott Walker much? fck yeah
なんちげ
Me gustó mucho la canción 😍😍
This sounds so different! I love it!
Du miel pour les oreilles 🍯 Merci AM ❤
If Cornerstone was written in 2022. 👌🏼
wheres the heaviness gone. shame
I love You monkeys ,You are my inspiration
To me, that's cinema.jpg
So relax moment :)
The last third of the song is 🔥🔥
ZZZZZZZZZZ
🎉🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Padu
2:30 estoy llorando
Te amo Alex, porfavor saluda a la voca 6🌼
Revivió la industria musical
We all gotta appreciate Alex's voice evolution.... just compare this to WPSIATWIN... Amazing 👏
Alex turner amo tu voz, eres tan increíble 🫰🏻
Las rolitas de Arctic son los mejores 🥰
Damn such a step backwards
You simply cannot tell me that this isn’t Alex paying homage to bands like ELO, mixed in with some Ziggy Stardust
That were a rite video that
HOLY SHIT
Exited
La voz de Alex es angelical
1:37 - 2:30 very Beatles
1:07.. Could it be..
Wow
The song is so unpredictable  I love it
so hyped for the new album !!!
Just wake up from nightmare and find arctic monkeys uploading again. Thank you
Esto es increíble, amo infinitamente la voz de Alex y el ritmo de la canción es hermoso, Amo Arctic Monkeys, lo mejor que me puedo pasar <3
Estos hombres son mi religión 🛐 joyita la que se aventaron😍 Nunca decepcionan ❤️ LOS AMOOOOOOO MONKEYS 😍❤️🐒
Insuperable. <3
Encore une perle, les Monkeys sont des maitres !!!
his voiceeeee
Arctic Monkeys chegando da Sonoridade que eles sempre quiseram chegar!!! Só imagino se haverá no álbum alguma música mais pesada e rápida com essa vibe, a cada álbum eles se superam 🎉😅
Que puedo decir de los monos siempre innovando y desde hoy body paint mi cancion favorita es como si viera una película dirigida por Alex turner quede  cautivado
The tranquility base hotel and casino hosted the Last Shadow Puppets
I agree with some comments, Arctic Monkeys is about curiosity where they gonna take you this time. I will remember Tranquility base for my entire life, probably its my favourite album till my last breath. And it's really intriguing where that car is taking me. Love you guys, DoP and the whole team are artists, Alex keep going!
Its only me that see one Brazilian flag in the wall? 0:06
Fino señores ,gracias monos por darnos esta grandiosa rola :']
Amazing...
2nd part of the song is awsome....starting with :"if you thinking of me im probably thinking of you" Im just thinking of repeating this song again and again!
im in love with this song.
OH MY GOD! Arctic monkeys is really amazing!!
I can't live without them.
AMOOOO
This is a Masterpiece. So many shifts in the song.
Estoy esperando a escuchar el álbum completo.  Dios. Arctic Monkeys arte.

Ufufufufufufufufff

HAAA 4:00

I miss Matt’s old school drumming and the banging guitar riffs. Alex sounds amazing as always. ❤😢
I NEED A MOVIE DIRECTED BY ALEX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Obviously as always a masterpiece ❤ thank you Arctic Monkeys for always calm me down
Perfecto ❤️
this will be one of the songs that people still listen to in 10+ years time
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL
Se siente el amor a la música y artistas británicos. Beatles, The Who, uff cómo llega al corazón la música.
His voice is terrible
EITA COMO HABLAM
cinematografía, composición, musicalización, Simplemente increíble.
AMOO!💗

somehow in the first third of the video I felt like I was listening to the Beatles sound
TE AMO BRISSIA
2:30 is when you know they about to pop off
The Arctic Beatles ❤
this new album gonna be awesome, I cant wait
biblical
This is a whole masterpiece
Alex will always be one of the hottest people
Massive Beatles vibes
no words ❤
Like always , their music builds up to somethinsg so amazing
Hay que admitirlos señores...es demasiado arte 🚬
Amo esta banda y la tranquilidad y paz que me causan al escuchar todas sus canciones, y sin duda el mensaje que dejan detrás de cada una 💗💗💗💗
Oh por Dios es tan perfecta…
This is going to sound epic next summer . Live from Carrow road . Still can’t believe your coming this close to me . Buzzing . The best band in the world for me !
arctic monkeys, i love you
Beatles white album esque
My little rockstar
Me encanta no puedo esperar para la siguiente canción ❤️❤️
This is a MASTERPIECE. You're the best band of this decade.
100% perfection 🔥
hoping to get tickets to sheffield omg
always something new and always better ❤️
when AM mett Beatles
wtf man this is so good
What are they doing. They need to go back to there roots instead of this out dated rubbish
Regreso Dios! 🖤🇲🇽🇬🇧
Their best era!!!
It's ok if you like this, not a problem with that. I think this band has lost their way. Trying something new is fine and all, but the singles they released and their last album was so mediocre. Not a rock band anymore and that hurts my heart. This stuff is boring.
😍😍
Someone please tell me why he didn’t belt at all? Did anyone else hear the live version first? Ending was way heavier and he went to singing from his diaphragm in the live version at the end
OH MY FUCKING FUCK AHHHHHHAHEJANSOJSJSKSL
Majestuoso
Los amo mis monitos💗
This is sooooooo brilliantly special 💕
I KNEW IT I KNEW IT I KNEW IT I KNEW THAT THIS WOULD BE ONE OF MY NEW FAVES
Absolutely love the video and the song.
This is actual magic, absolutely blown away by how damn good this was holy shit
Here before it gets millions of views 😄
What is this masterpiece.... I'm gonna loop it
i love you matt, alex, jamie and nick💗🌹
masterpiece...
Am only i confused that every their new clip looks so much the same? They kind of find their style and they keep repeating it. Not my piece of cake to be honest
Playback speed from 3:00...   Normal = The Car  1.25 = AM  1.5 = Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not
Totally underwhelming.
Hermoso ❤
Another one masterpiece from Arctic monkeysss
I was came up for listening some AM-stuff. that's exactly what I meant.
the comeback we all perfectly imagined
This whole video and song has been beautifully written and filmed, I appreciate these legends so much. They have always made me feel at peace. Thank you AM
If alex turns into a film director , i would definitely watch his movies
If you a fan of old arctic monkeys tunes please go sub the this channel gonna be releasing some indie Rock music soon
MASTERPIECE OMG IT WILL KILL EVERYTHING
Top tier music!!! 👑🙏
AAAAAA LOS AMO ARCTIC MONKEYS. EN EFECTO, ES ARTE 🚬
Whatever people say and see, that’s not their favourite hotel & casino, that’s the car.
LA CINEMATOGRAFIA??? AMO
🖤👾
I’ll come back when Alex stops trying hard to sound american.
oh my god
Completamente apaixonada 🥰🥰🥰
Meudeus como arctic monkeys ficou tão ruim????
I am so lucky that I’m one of the first ones who was here
Gracias ala vida por aver conocido está bando i love You artic monkeys
Yet another Arctic Monkeys banger! Keep on rocking!
Mudded
are we  going to get mv for every song oh holy monkeys
love it
Directed by Duffer brothers
IITSS SO GOOD
I will always love all the music you give to us the real fans , it just gets better and better💕
_ Me encanta!!!. 💖 _ I love it!!! 💖  _ Saludos desde Chile 🇨🇱 _ Greetings from Chile 🇨🇱
the "HAH" sent me into orbit 😭
i love this sm
My life has split on before and after this vid
Se me erizó la piel al escuchar esta canción! Es una maravilla... La voz de Alex me lleva a otro mundo.... Excelente de principio a fin 👌 Love Arctic Monkeys 💫
Good grief
lighting is so good 🪩
te quiero arti monkis
LONG LIFE ARCTIC MONKEYS ♡
cant wait for the album
have you thanked for being alive in 2022?
I've been driving 'round, listening to The Caaaaaaaaaarrr
Finally we've reached the strokes era where they start to experiment now. I'm excited.  I love this song but it's still up whether I'll love it as much as I did A Certain Romance, but this is definitely going after Mardy Bum for me.   These string instruments are hella nice.
❤ can’t even
this is true music
I honestly can’t stand this new era. Just being honest. Freedom to them with going in whatever direction they want, but Jesus. AM >>>
This is a Masterpiece
QUE ROLOOON
Excepcional uff
incredible, as always!
Estamos en la antesala del mejor disco de la década.
Bela trilha sonora de um filme CULT. Agora, álbum?  É pra escutar uma vez e esquecer que existe.  Que sdds de ver um lançamento como Humbug.
00:44 blade runner
SUCH BEAUTIFUL PHOTOGRAPHY
2:11
if u are thinking about me i'm probably thinking about you
Llevo años siendo fan y simplemente estoy tan feliz de estás canciones y el álbum ❣️
arctic monkeys did it again
Love the video 🤩
I don't think I'll ever get over Alex's eternal beauty. And this song gets better with every listen
a ver pes alex sorpréndeme
I never fail to be impressed
feeling so much bowie in this one!
Adorando essa nova era Roberto Carlos do Arctic Monkeys. A voz do Alex é maravilhosa demais!!!
4:07 1:23 i'm predicting a song with shoulder in the title bc matt also did a shoulder move in the TBAM mv
As if my day couldn't get any better Arctic Monkeys release a new song and it's already a fucking masterpiece. Good jobs lads, also I don't know if you pay enough all the people that were involved in the video but they gotta be paid even more. I don't care.
While I am not thrilled with the direction they are going in... this and Mirrorball are abosolutely masterpieces.
I wanna be Alex Turner.
"I don't know, is it classy enough?"
teh best that i see and ear in this year <3
best band in the world
i'm so early and i love this so much
So ig reel intro
NUNCA ME DECEPCIONAS ALEX TKM
exquisito
Mature as a strong cheese as Miles Kane would say! Just joking... But these guys age like a fine wine! Very cinematic. Just perfection!
Uwe Ochsenknech
A requiem for the harlequin
Ufffff The Last Shadow Puppets finale consume Arctic Monkeys 😎
My word. Yet again! ❤️
Babe wake up new Arctic monkeys song dropped
0:19  y  ya me enamoré de esta canción!🔥
I LOV<3
que sensação de nostalgia daquilo que eu nem sei 😮❤
is perfect
tengo los pelos de punta
Arctic Monkeys haven't really been for me since AM, but you can't deny that views:likes ratio is very impressive
omg
REVIVIÓ LA MÚSICA
Wonderful, class, awesome, beautiful, delightful, this is the car ✨🚗
Simplesmente... sensacional!!!
I fucking love guys
Vocês me surpreendem se uma forma que eu fico tão orgulhosa 😢
masterpiece
Coool
this album is gonna be so good
They can do better than this
Cinematography, the lyrics, the voice, everything is just so good! This is why they’ve been my favorite band for many years!
Love the song, don’t love charging £80 a ticket for next year’s tour, absolute piss take
Love it
To anyone mad at the sound of this album, and complaining about how they're supposed to be a "rock band" get over it. Their last album that considered rock was almost a decade ago. It's time to accept the change or move on.
This is poetry
HA!
Zzzzz, miss the first two albums vibe 😢
its more than tbh&c, its masterpiece
This music video is amazing. I’m so excited to see what other ingenious tricks they have up their sleeve.
Ngl I wasn't ready for this
Some things are meant to be good and AM is definitely one of them! Thank you God and the gang
4m35s of trolling
ahora me siento peor por no haber conseguido boletos para ir a verlos 😭😭😭😭😭
VEI Q MÚSICA PERFEITA
Its winter sunset and you're walking out with your headphones, unseen, away from people ..the orange sky is full of  clouds .. and all you can hear is the Arctic Monkeys. It's heaven
Que banda meus amigos, que banda!
imaginen ser hate de los monos y no poder burlarse de ellos PORQUE TODO LO QUE HACEN ES UNA OBRA DE ARTE!!!!
I love the "ah"
Just like they say in "One point Perspective"   "This stunning documentary that no one else unfortunately saw. Such beautiful photography" its just describe pretty good this video.
Me encantó!! Esto si que es arte 👏🏻
Is that you David Bowie ?
To me this sounds like Bowie and Elton John early 70's in their heyday.  Great.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Excuse me but holy shit this is so good!! Soooo Beautiful like omg I already know this is my favourite song❤❤❤❤I ❤️ AM
Alex sounds like Bowie.
Omg I love it!! 😍😍😍
Sounds shit tbh
Perfecta.
Is this the Arctic Monkeys or is it Alex solo?
There’s so much going on right now, this video has too many things to discover
Always look forward to the lyrics of alex .you never know what to expect  . Never fails to impress  me
Their every albume has a different vibe and I'm really into it with this vibes🤙🤙🤙
THIS IS A MASTERPIECE
i dont think they belong to this century
AHHHHHHHHHH
Increíble
03:37 Ziggy Stardust
Te amo Arctic Monkeys ❤ Nunca decepcionas 🙏🏻
Si se dieron cuenta de que todos lo álbumes van de la mano?  Es simplemente hermoso. Difícil describir este momento.  Es una sensación similar a cuando los Strokes sacaron el CM. Se sintió la nostalgia y el pasar de los años.  Cosas de fans.   Datos personales: * El CM era el final perfecto para los Strokes.   * No sé si pueda aguantar ver salir otro álbum de AM, más madurez y nostalgia en un álbum no creo que puedan volver a plasmar en uno siguiente. 🥺✍️
ALEX NEVER DISAPPOINTS
This music sound like feel silk fabric on my skin for me
Never been early.
So grateful for every thing that they do and share with us! 🖤
Tem uma mistura e profundidade sonora memorável.  Me remete aos anos 80 como estivesse ouvido em algum momento da vida, é mágico essa sensação de familiaridade mas também original. Ansioso pelo novo álbum!!! Parabéns!!!
AM are absolutely legendary
Te amo tanto Arctic monkeys
Love this song so much. The way Alex sings and the violin addition are just amazing.
Strangest one yet!
I'm i. Love all over again!
Definitivamente es cine 🚬🚬
ben bu insana asigim gercekten asigim bu kadar mukemmel olamaz bir insan ya 😭😭 her seyi o kadar guzel ki 🪩
I LOVE YOU ALL
Anyone awake can see the comms in their music since tbhac
Aaaahhh Increíble, ya saquen todo el álbum, no se que esperan. Hasta ahora las 2 canciones han estado buenisimas
The vibe…..change my mood in seconds 🚗
🤎🤎🤎
i’m ngl i don’t understand this video but go monkeys 💪🏽
Watching them get old hits hard.  Since 2009
I love this song about cum ♡😸
sono innamorata fi questa canzone
God this is beautiful
Чета неоч
Spectacular!
kings theater homies?
3:35 pink Floyd vibes
This is the lovely son of AM + Tranquility Base + Everything youve come to expect and I love it 💞😍
Not sure on what to give my attention first. The great song ot the great video…
Esto si!
2:27 at this part, I said "m*ther's pu**y" out loud (this is a very slang Turkish phrase). And people who use slang a lot like me, use that phrase when they're seriously surprised. I'm seriously surprised.
questo video e sta canzone son qualcosa di fantastico, vi amo.
I need the whole album, seriously 🫂
The beginning really is elevator music…  and I love it 🤩
😍🥰✨ los amoooooooooooo
❤️❤️❤️❤️☺️🎶
Arctic Monkeys rules. Cheers from Chile 🇨🇱
So good🤤
that outro guitar
I didn't think anything could beat Mirrorball but here we go
I'm satisfied
thank you Arctic Monkeys. For everything
Haaaaa 🖤
Qué linda canciónnn, no veo la hora de verlos en Argentina 🇦🇷
🔥🔥🔥
I love that this album is giving us Tranquility Base vibes
🫀
Me mata logo🤍🤍
Ojalá que sea de las canciones más flojitas del disco, porqué vaya que está de flojera total. La anterior la tuve que escuchar más de 3 veces para entenderla, ojalá que con esta no sean 15.  Ojalá que este no sea el disco más aburrido de los Arctic Monkeys.
David Bowie meets Brian May as Arctic Monkeys in 2022 - Goosebumps
nice.
Not as good as Mirrorball obviously, but still a banger. The beginning instrumental tho 😩
How do they manage to be so cool?
Can’t wait to watch them live!!
AHHHHHHH
Incrível apenas
BRO THIS IS EPIC
Amazinh
La madurez de Alex, se está poniendo viejo. Es genial y a la vez nostálgico ver a los Arctic Monkeys sumidos en una nueva aventura. Los años pasan para todos, para ellos, para nosotros los fans, para todos.
What is this honey 😬
I’m speechless what a masterpiece ♥️
Ansiosa pelo show❤
The outro, the guitar, the cinematography *chef kiss*
Apaixonada nesa música

Waaa, una obra de arte
i miss when they play loud guitar music
💚💚💚💚
This man can never stop getting attractive
Can someone explain the meaning of the video? struggling to understand all the images and what not
Q BNA CANCIÓN DE VERDAD ACABO DE ESCUCHAR A UN ÁNGEL CANTAR
Simplesmente perfeição, essa música no começo estava, bom mas esse final 🤯🤯🤯. Amei que eles colocaram violino no instrumental da música, Arctic Monkeys nunca erra em nos impressionar 🖤🤍🖤🤍
The more you listen the more you fall in love with this song!!!
Que tranquilidad es escuchar esta canción
Estoy llorando 😭😭😭😭😭
ayo this song is sick
LET'S GGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
ALEX TURNERRRRR WAAAAAAAAAAA
The truth is that the album makes me sleepy, you can see that it will be very boring, many comments will say that it is a masterpiece but they say it by mainstreams because it is too quiet they wanted to apply it as an interpol but it did not work out for them no song will be highlighted I assure you but keep commenting mainstreams 😴😴😴😴 Zzzzzzzzz
ELES NUNCA ERRAM
😭LLORO DE FELICIDAD
Definitivamente revivió la industria de la música la puta madre
It gives Taylor Swift midnight vibes
La música ha despertado, cabrones
I understand all great bands must "evolve" but hasus cristo WTF HAS HAPPENED TO THEIR MUSIC!!?!?!?!
Música aburrida. Esto no es Arctic Monkeys.
teamo alex
and if you're thinking of me, i'm probably thinking of you
we have to agree that arctic monkeys is the best band of the 21st century
ughhh so good
alex is just perfection
q buenas canciones hacen los monos articos
i want alex turner to sing me to go to sleep this is PERFECT
2:35 Space Oddity synth reference?
This one is most definitely a banger as well. 👌🏼
Am I the only one who feels the Beatles flavor? 🤔🤔🤔
this sucks
need him he need me
ciglik atiyom
I'm from Thailand 😍😍
Waiting for new material from The Last Shadow Puppets. This songs ok 👌

He is singing higher than ever before and I still can't belive how his voice range is going through so many changes... i definitely do not hate it, but not love it either...  The video though is incredible for sure
This is so good
this is wonderful 💕💕💕💕💕 i love how they change their style everytime and it's always so good .
Que DELICINHA minha nossa. Ui ui ui ui.
I have never seen such a brilliant use of visual metaphors, Like I'm speechless, thankyou monkeys for believing in your Art and showing us what you want to show!
I love it ❤🌈
The gold top les paul fits this song honestly
ISSO É TÃO INCRÍVEL ❤❤😭
4:00 HA!   Sorry can't help it but this is too cute! 👀
Idk how to put it into words this is beautiful <3 :(
buz meymunlari formunda gene
Violin part has the same progression as Something by the Beatles! I love it!
Esto si es musica jder como amo a los monitos articos🐒
Alex took Ben Kingsley to acting school
My grandpa telling my dad about The Beatles, then my dad told me about Queen. So i'm gonna tell my kids about Arctic fucking Monkeys🙌
AMOOOOOOOOOOO ❤️
amei aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Perfect 😻❤
HA
4:01 LOL HAHAHA

Lütfen tekrar tura çıkın lütfen lütfennn 😭🥺
Alex ReTurner
This is so good.
Dammmm ❤️❤️❤️❤️
OMG I LOVE IT, IT'S PERFECT
This song reminds me of The Last Shadow Puppets. I feel a little bit of Miles Kane’s influence in this song.
Pero que belleza de video y canción, ya extrañaba aos Arctic Monkeys. Pinta para ser un discazo ❤️❤️❤️
amazing!!!!!!!!
For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed, to lie in Do your time traveling through the tanning booth So you don't let the sun catch you crying  So predictable, I know what you're thinking  My teeth are beating and my knees are weak It's as if there's something up with the wiring You can poke your head behind the mountain peak It don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding  So predictable I know what you're thinking  I'm watching your every move I feel the tears are coming on It won't be long It won't be long  Straight from the cover shoot There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I'm keeping on my costume  And calling it a writing tool And if you're thinking of me I'm probably thinking of you  There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face  There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face  So predictable I know what you're thinking Ooh, hah, yeah  :)
What's going on with artic monkeys
<PERFECTION>
ALEX SOS HERMOSO
😍😍😍😍😍
Sounds amazing, 1:40 reminds me of the start of Paul's part in A day in the life by the Beatles
✨visual art✨
Obrigado Alex, pela capacidade de adentrar em nossos corações com a sua poesia. Pqp. Q delícia.
Los Arctic Monkeys nunca despcionan
⚡❤️
Feeling a bit of TLSP vibes and love the imagery with the OOOOs 🥰 phenomenal artists
I haven't seen it but I already know that it'll be a masterpiece ✨
Arctic Monkeys went modern Sgt. Pepper's (?) and I loved it
💝💝💝💝
Very Electric Lights Orchestra inspired
Nice
"Renació la música" jajaja buenísimo
this reminds Bowie so much in production way, but with AM’s classy unique touch! they never fail on being good af!
Absolutely surreal! This is like nothing I’ve ever heard. And probably won’t hear as well. And of course, there’s those stunning rotating shots of our men performing in earnest. I’m hooked.
Kenapa jadi David Bowie gini dah vibesnya, tapi bagus sih.
I don't even know I like these kind of music, not before I listen to this MASTERPIECE 🔥🔥🔥
vam dobre jebe ty kokos
We want the old arctic moneys back from the album AM

I love the new style 😍
Beatles y David Bowie. Buenas influencias. Será un disco interesante.

4:12 is epic
Excelente producción, cinematográfico, están en otro nivel, felicitaciones!!! La voz de Alex se escucha de maravilla 😎🐒🥶

Alex has a very nice sense of cinematography
Very Beatles / Electric light Orchestra sound ❤
✨️💜✨️💜✨️
El spaguetto in da house
nueva obsesión sin duda
omg he uses a guitar that we've never seen beforee
Wooohooo new content for my wet dreams!! Thanks mates! <333
Love how they use the violin in the new album, just perfect
❤️❤️❤️❤️
21th of October seems so far away right now!!! GOD i can't wait for the realese of the whole album! I can tell it's gonna be amazing! Aging like fine wine...
😭😭😭😭
WHOAH WHOAH
Simplemente su música es perfecta y tan relajante
THIS IS SO FUCKING AWESOME
I MISSED THIS SO MUCH
Te AMo.

Best song since AM. 👌🏼 Change my mind. I’ll wait
❤️
⚡🔥⚡
Guitars are back 😭😭😭😭
this is like an extended characterization of an reccurring archetype: the mr.inconspicuous from when the sun goes down, now a wes anderson-esque antagonist
wow. terapia.
I like this alex
put alex turner in a movie right now!!!
I- WOW i LOVE LOVE LOOVVVEE the tbhq vibes just tossed and there its just perfect
yes, how many times do I have to cry again?
perfecttttttt🤍
From 🇧🇷🇧🇷😍👍🏻
A 4:00
This is poor man's Bowie
These guys are aging like fine wine.
Beautiful :´c
They have matured so much, xx.
My mind still processing, this will be on reiterated in my headphones. The filming and song is exquisitely immaculate. LOVE IT:)
Genius.
Congratulations to Brook Linder for directing possibly The Monkeys finest video.
alex's vocal skills are getting better and better at each song wooow
Oh my. eargasm 🫦🫦
Total masterpiece❤️
This is one of the most satisfying music videos I've seen in a long time!
when Alex said "ah" I really felt that
No es que me desagrade, es bueno que los grupos tengan una evolución pero lo que siento es que podría ser un disco de Alex en solitario y no el de los Artic
The Car is going to be an incredible album, maybe even better than Humbug
Ya bu ne ustam biz senden brainstorm kadar hareketli istemiyoruz tamam ama bu ne ya ruhum daraldı tbhcnin gözünü seveyim ya
BODY PAINT MV IS JUST PERFECTOOOOO
This is art !!!!
this song is an experience for sure. i was confused the whole time but you know what, i fw it.
alex returner🔥
I love how the song keeps on growing!
Am I the only ones the don't like this new songs?
AMIGOOO, DIOS EL VIDEO CLIP, TODO ES PERFECTO
I'm going back to 505😔
Balleremo tutta la notte ❤️✨, amore mio.   (🥟🌷❤️)

Se nota que a Alex le gustan los Beatles, me encantó ❤️
IN LOVE.
I wanna inject this song in my vein
1000000000000/10
The beatles for 20firsts century
Sounds good.
please AM
This is fucking incredible oh my god
The Beatles and Bowie Vibes hits so hard. And the classic Alex solos Style, Damn. So good. 💎🤌🏻
This should’ve been a 7 minute song
Don’t Believe The Hype!
03:35 the moment that you are looking for
This is so bad
I truly love the music video concept of this new album, their new style gives me old library vibe its like comes from the future and the past at the same time
screaming crying dying throwing up sliding down the wall
simply perfect, i really love how am is changing through the years and accepting different ways of still making their amazing music
Ya amo mucho este album ❤
here 2022
THE COME BACK !

q vibe boaaa
Esplêndido
Incredible voice..!
🐵
I love the arctic monkeys but for some reason the two last single are not hitting for me 😬 but I still get the vinyl !!!
Decadencia de los Arctic Monkeys. De un estilo que te hacia mover el cuerpo pasaron a música para ir a dormir.
A new banger by the cold apes with stunnin cinematography
🥰🥰🥰💜💜💜💜
Amazing! 0:20 those high notes
The last shadow monkeys. Miss the guitar riffs. Dafuq is this
AND NOW THEY'RE BACK!
MR JAMIE COOK ON THE ELECTRIC GUITAR
Ahh more shit music, lovley.
What an absolute masterpiece. Can't wait for The Car.
Maravilhoso... Como sempre! Nunca decepcionam. E esse vocal do Alex hein?? Impressionante... E o instrumental também, perfeito..
IM OBSSESED❤
THOSE SNOOKER BALLS, BREAK... IM... I MEAN, LAST 2,5 MINUTES :,,,,,,,,],
I’m leaving the lyrics here so I can enjoy more this masterpiece by reading this poetry :  [Verse 1] For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed, to lie in Do your time traveling through the tanning booth So you don’t let the sun catch you crying  [Chorus] So predictable, I know what you're thinking  [Verse 2] My teeth are beating and my knees are weak It's as if there’s something up with the wiring You can poke your head behind the mountain peak It don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding  [Chorus] So predictable I know what you're thinking  [Bridge] I'm watching your every move I feel the tears are coming on It won't be long It won't be long  [Refrain] Straight from the cover shoot There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I’m keeping on my costume And calling it a writing tool And if you’re thinking of me I'm probably thinking of you  [Refrain] There’s still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face So predictable I know what you’re thinking.
ARTIC MONKEYS IS BACK GUYS, THEY ARE INCREDIBLE. HUGS FROM BRAZIL, WE LOVE YOURS
No hay chance
i cannot wait to see this mans live
I love it
I LOVE YOU FOREVER ALEX TURNER YOU HAVE MY HEART ❤
dios como t amo arctic monkeys
Ok, I'm definitely in love with the pairing Arctic Monkeys + strings section
1:44 like a calmer, less disorientating nod to the transition in The Beatles' A Day in the Life. Enjoyed it. Second listen this is also a massive nod to bohemian rhapsody... 'mother I killed a man...'
revivio la música
LOVED THE AESTHETIC
Happy to be that early
minha ficha ainda não tinha caído q o am7 é real e vai estar entre nós em poucos dias
The perfection ❤️
Another banger. Cant wait for this album.

TBHC youngest brother is cominggg
This album is on another level 🤞🏻
No notification! Ugh. I needed this.
THIS SONG AND THE CINEMATOGRAPHY IS EVERYTHING!! ❤
Not the way he says “arms” 😩 *dies*

WHO’S WAITING FOR THE ALBUM YALL?!🤩
whatever this is , im loving it
These images are incredible. It is a great time to be a monkeys fan. Thanks for this.
definitely their best music video.. I'm in love with everything about this !
allllaahhhhhhhhhh
🧡
As a fan, I don't even care if arctic monkeys don't get the appreciation they deserve. And neither do they care about it. They are doing what they love and feel like doing which as a fan I totally respect. I always listen to their music not with the expectation of what I want, but with the curiosity of knowing about what artistic world the monkeys have webbed for us. Even if I am the last person who appreciates the legends from Sheffield who turned the music industry, it would still be worth every second that I have listened to their music. AM forever🖤
Quite late to the game as I only have recently fully discovered this amazing band, but now am the proud owner of all their works on vinyl and am so looking forward to The Car coming out to own that as well. As for this single, it's absolutely beautiful and cathartic!!!!
Omg the guitars <3 and Alex's voice. I'm already in love this new aesthetic and everything!!! :D
No one ones how much I missed them😭💖
love u Arctic monkeys, and “the car” will be amazing ❤️
Gorgeous homage to criterion collection films
holy fuck.
That is one of their best songs and best videos
I'M ACTUALLY CRYING OF HOW BEAUTIFUL THIS SONG IS, I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE REAL
Amazing
absolutely insane I love
Bom para escutar tomando um cafezinho com bolinho de fubá. Brabo demais.
They are masterpiece 🔥❤️His voice is magical 💥
ALEX HACEME UN HIJO MI  ORTO ESTÁ ABIERTO
Love the song and video ❤❤
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL 💗
im in love with this masterpiece so i slowed it ;)
Mediocre as hell. Sounds like it could've been a Tranquility Base b-side.
They never fail🎸✌🏻
👏🙌
DEVORARON💋
Una obra de arte, me encantó ❤😭
AAAAA QUE BUENA CANCION, sin duda ahora es una de mis favoritass💞

This sounds fabulous

Vim correndo ver o hino dos maiores!!! Mto bom, eles nunca erram mano namoral!!, tô apaixonada
Mi hombre d bonita voz
Magical.

MASTERPIECEEE
Alex t amo muchooooo
That transition at 1:40 to "I'm watching your every move.."... good lord man.. this is like a dream come true, absolutely top notch.. wow
Alex is becoming the next joker hahahaha
Alex Turner never misses.
Wasn't sure about Mirrorball, but this is tremendous.
SIMPLEMENTE LOS AMO
2:19 OMFG
"Arctic Monkeys" are the new "The Beatles"
VI AMO 😩😩😩
HACEN MI VIDA MUCHO MEJOR GRACIAS GRACIAS
The visual 💀💀💀💀💀
THIS IS HEAVEN ✨
Absolute masterpiece! Ꚙ
The production of this video is so fucking immaculate, I dont even know where to begin. Fucking beautiful
La amé desde el primer segundo
This evening has just gotten better.
meh
Solo got me like😩
Wow That's smell gooood
Felt like a movie 🫶🏻
Paul McCartney vives. What a piece of art
The way I started floating
los amo Arctic Monkeys, todo lo q sacan es tan wow todos los aspectos🤩💘💝💖💗💓
Lebih
certeza q vai ser a melhor do álbum
Turners at it again
A LOAD OF SHITE
The most beautiful video from Arctic Monkeys is here. This is pure ART! Great song, btw
MT BOM PQP
Pelitos de punta entrando al chat
it's hard to pass by this number indifferently! Picture, music, what a legend!
this is much better than mirrorball
Muy bonito y todo, pero me siguen faltando los riffs apoteosicos desde el TBHC , este estilo soft ya se hace monótono a ratos.
Por ti vivo alex
This sounds always were the escence of the Monkyes, incluiding the solo part of Alex (Submarine). This is maybe the evolution of  Tranquility Base.. but exploring a more sensitive side. And I fucking love it.
A voz do Alex ta cada vez mais linda mn -------
Love love love
Me encanta cómo Alex está experimentando más con su voz <3

AAAAAA EL FINAAAAAL DIOS MÍO ES Q TODO ES INCREÍBLE❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
just yeeeeeeeeeeeee
I wasn't buying this vibe at first but just like with tbhc they finally have me
Once Alex said Rock'n Roll never dies.. He killed by himself...
Saw this and I literally dropped everything I was carrying
♡♡♡
This is probably the most impeccable aesthetic thing I’m gonna see this year. Like living in a new world
😍🇧🇷
So good
Aaaaaaaaaaa
COMO AMO A ESTE HOMBRE, el instrumental por diooooos, amo a Alex, amo Arctic Monkeys
Yahu caz yapmayı birakın da rockn rolla dönelim artık...
THIS IS AMAZING OMG
Everything about this is a masterpiece.
mais uma vez mamacos do ártico lançando a braba🍷
delícia quando uma banda amadurece junto com você - perfeito ; música incrível , clipe incrível , produção incrível ! <3 <3 <3
Sacked the guitarists then…..
I preferred the Arctic Monkeys when they got my blood pumping and not my thumbs clicking
This song reminds me of a certain band called The Last Shadow Puppets
Woah 15 mins ago
OMFG, SO PROUD OF Y’ALL GUYS <3
I LOVE THEM SO MUCH <3
iconic
няняня
MY CLAIMED TRACKLKK
this album is shaping up to be tranquility base's favourite worst nightmare
a surprise of course, but a welcome one!
Killing it with the mature sounds and insane lyrics. Everything artic monkeys.
único
AMEI!!!!!
Does anyone know how to get the effect on 0:48? That's that metal gear solid effect
😴😴😴
Fantastico👌
This is their most interesting song to date. They're reinventing themselves again. Turner's songwriting is impeccable. A timeless song.
Idk…  I cried  I laughed   n I was shocked asf because I love this.
Amazing
ITS OUT
ÇIĞLIKKKKK
HEAVENLY
Meh, back to the first few albums I go..
0:49 wow Alex what are you doing I'm scared
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
En efecto hoy ganó la industria de la música 🚬
Sii señoras y señores. Arctic Monkeys está renaciendo de nuevo ❤️😎
i love you arctic monkeys ❤
Alex Turner no shape
The first one was good but this 👌
Omg this is five stars out of five
Haaaaa te amo Alex 😭
love the use of film and vintage lenses here. makes it feel like an upscaled 90s music video, from maybe like the britpop era or something
Hey i love you 🫀
They’re really taking the Tranquility base hotel and casino sound and mastering it
LIMDOOOO TE AMO MUITO AMOR
Gli AM non tornano alle canzoni movimentate dei primi lavori ma bensì continuano sulla falsa riga (questo di sentirà con certezza quando uscirà tutto il disco) dell'ultimo album. Cosa che non era per nulla scontata. Sarà un prodotto più di nicchia ma con sonorità del genere, soprattutto per chi ha più pazienza dell'ascolto, è facile farsi ipnotizzare. Bellissimo il singolo. Bellissimo il video. Aspettiamo con ansia le date del loro tour.
2:16 spooked me out ngl
muito brabo paizão
Fucking masterpiece right there.
Love it.
Another class tune fae the best band of all time
I can't explain the emotions that Alex Turner's voice gives me.  His voice us very special 💜
Sad how they’ve fallen from Grace. Still amazing live though…
love you
Another masterpiece, I love that you always try to bring something new, to create something different, and everytime I get amazed by how beautiful and amazing your music is... I've been listening to Arctic Monkeys since I was 14 and I always look forward to new music and concepts, love you guys so much <3 Thank you for making the music you like and for being amazing artists
I live for my mother I die for artic monkys
¿Nadie más hablará del solo excepcional que introduce el final de la canción? ¿O de las referencias a Magritte? Son una bellezaaaa.
you really gave me an heart attack
Another timeless ✅️
They can never make not one bad song!!
For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed, to lie in Do your time traveling through the tanning booth So you don’t let the sun catch you crying  So predictable, I know what you're thinking  My teeth are beating and my knees are weak It's as if there’s something up with the wiring You can poke your head behind the mountain peak It don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding  So predictable I know what you're thinking  I'm watching your every move I feel the tears are coming on It won't be long It won't be long  Straight from the cover shoot There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I’m keeping on my costume And calling it a writing tool And if you’re thinking of me I'm probably thinking of you  There’s still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face So predictable I know what you’re thinking Ooh, hah, yeah
Definitivamente una joya
Ya quiero escucharla en MÉXICO ❤️🇲🇽
ME ATRAPASTE ES MÚSICA  ♡
Same old boring regurgitated wannabe Morrissey bullshit. 🤮🤮🤮
<3
Son y serán siempre los mejores
Esto dejo de ser Arctic Monkeys para ser Alex Turner solista, no encuentro nada de lo caracteristico de la banda y esto suena a evolución pero para mal, porque si no me dices que esto es Arctic Monkeys realmente podría ser cualquier banda donde Alex Turner cante.   Han sacrificado y cambiando su identidad que los caracterizaba, para eso mejor que Alex haga un proyecto aparte y nos se cuelgue de su banda.
babe, wake up. new arctic monkeys song.
😳
the Beatles vibes! love it ❤
Its like the good old days, Placebo, Muse and Arctic Monkeys releasing great music in the same year
ARCTIC MONKEYSSSSS AHHHHH🔥
Sensação de que vou sair voando pela janela ouvindo isso aqui. Bom demais ❤️🥲❤️
The ending part pleaseeee >>>> ✨
feel like i gotta be in a specific mood for this. i do like the cinematicness don’t get me wrong but not a giant fan of the high notes
"And if you're thinking of me, I'm probably thinking of you"  YOU HIT ME, ALEX!
AAAYYYYYYY 37 minutos tarde, pero vale la pena <333 Perfección pura.
FAVS
ZZZZZZZZZZZ
MASTERPIECE
Thank you for feeding us very very well. Compliments to the chef, <3
yeaaaaaah
La canción y video son una obra de arte 🤯
SO GOOD!!!!!!!
Great song and video, but I miss guitars and indie rock :(
Arctic Monkeys will never fail to make me feel at peace with life
Ah wouah ❤️
que buen tema tiene algunas influencias de los beatles, y ese solo uff grandioso
Beatles for Lo-fi generation
From 1:40 onwards this song is nothing short of perfection itself
Watching this while at work. Literally stopped everything I was doing and went straight to the bathroom to watch hahahah
Alex is a genius 🙌🏽
bestie wake up arctic monkeys just released a new song!!
1:40 WHOSE DIRTY NAILS ARE THOSE
Diosss que joyaaaa
el videoclip.... no words
!!Damn.💥..so.far.so.good...🤘🏻
What’s this shite? As Noel Gallagher said where’s the Choruses? Don’t even know how people can listen to this utter shite
Incrível... Espetacular
Alex🤩🤩
Nice video
What a masterpiece 😍 The Car is coming at high speed!
yea I'm comment # 29,789 yay!!!!!!!
Perfection
every song they release I get shivers
Like a track from Rocky Horror Show 2 or something.
New Arctic Monkeys! What a way to start my day!
Que lindo, como está pintando este album, gracias alex hermanito, en la cena familiar nos vemos y charlamos de "The Car"
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHSYDYWYQIWU2728W75S4ZGWJ2OW8D6D51GAHZKidy2uq8wyq615wthzkxoduauYA7W726WTVQSKOS9W7W5WGWJWOSIDY7W82IQHWGEUW91826WGAH IM FREAKING OUT
MASTERPIECE ❤️❤️
Giving a day in the life vibe
SCREAMING IN ALEX TURNER
Omfg this is pure heaven, thanks for making me so happy babies, eternal love for Arctic Monkeys 🤟🏻
his voice sounds so magical in this song oh my god
Simplemente INCREIBLE ❤
PLEASE COME TO CANADA, I SWEAR, MAYBE TORONTO :'( I need to see this.
This song is unreal I can’t stop listening to it ❤😅
holy shit this is a love letter to film in the best way possible and the song slaps too
❣️
Umarola
Arctic Monkeys is all i listen to - and i will support them in whatever direction they go. I feel this song is so close to being a little like their old self, i love the end, but not a fan of the beginning.  Really hope they will have something for us nostalgic fans in The Car. Either way, ill love it im sure.
so good
OMG ANOTHER SONG CRYING SCREAMING ATM
MEOWWWWWW
este nuevo disco me va a sacar de la depresión, GRACIAS! El video es otro nivel, increíble.
your best song so far...👏👏👏
Orgulloso de ver cuánto han evolucionado mis monos. El álbum entero pinta para ser el soundtrack perfecto de una buena película. La música es tan cinemática, y la fotografía del video ni se diga. Alex Turner ya hace cine.
perfect. this new album is going to add years to my life
Muy Beatles, aquí es donde se da las gracias por seguir vivo
No I don’t let the Sun catch me crying typically, but alas what a lovely day for arrival of this song into my life!   Thank you for the distant serenade monkeys of the arctic
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ME ALEGRARON EL DIA
Looooooveeeee it!
I'm high af and a arctic monkeys notification pops up posted 34 minutes ago. That's sums the night.
one day it will be an old song and we all will flashback to this moment when we heard that song for the first time.
This video is the most aesthetic one I’ve EVER seen. Every shot is immaculate! And the song OMG, I love it❤❤❤
just i need
BROOOOOOROROROOROROROR
Masterfuckingpiece
🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝
El tema horrible, el tono de voz cansino
The more I listen, the better it gets.
Something different and I love it
Im gonna tatto the music sheet and the lyrics of this song on my skin
This song  and the video is soo fucking beautiful Arctic monkeys music is evolving ❤❤❤
Simply superb! Reminds me a lot of the work done in Everything You've Come To Expect... Lovely masterpiece.
Parece mais The last shadow Puppets, do que o próprio arctic
Wow, that's really perfect!
TheBeatles&BeachBoys&BryanFerry  influence = only great original current rock band Arctic Monkeys.
que temazo
Estoy enamorada
The song is good, but I'm not sure about Alex's falsetto. He is not very good at it
Es una obra de Arte en todos los sentidos! 😍🤩😍
You fell off
i only had time to listen to the first half of this in my passing period between classes but i cant wait to finish it when i get out of school i’m already in love with this song
el hombre sexo
You are legends you’re always managing to surpass yourselves I’m speechless
DIOS MIO POR QUE LOS ARREGLOS SON TAN GOD ❣️❣️❣️ EN DEFINITIVA ESTO ES ARTE🚬
Structure is very four out of five like with the bridge placement, the build up to the repetitive chorus and fading out with a guitar solo.   Good tune
It's aite
it’s good autumn which is announced
another slow shit song I still dont know how this band was my favorite band for so long
The directing of this video is IMMACULATE
Such a Bloody Masterpiece, Poetry Soul and a Good Solo, his the best of our generation... no doubts about this!
I WOKE UP TO THIS WOOHOOO
Just Fantastic
Bowie vibes . Fucking brilliant
damn, based on these two singles there is a real possibility that the car could be even better than tbh+c.
The recycled ghost of Beatles n Bowie. It's good mind.
Beautiful.
Got malkmus' guitar😍
Amazing ❤
This song begins to take form in the middle
❤
The amount of layer and depth, just visually. I haven't even sat down to analyze the lyrics, but the visual metaphors and the references, the emphasis on cinema and the creation of cinema, highlighting the editor's room and paying homage to all of the behind-the-scenes logistics and equipment that audiences usually don't see when looking at the final product. It's absolutely beautiful, I cannot wait for the album to drop. The Car era is already exceeding all my expectations.
Love me some Artic Monkeys.
❤❤❤
Ok it’s official, they want to kill me.
AAAGH SO MUCH LOVE
This has got to be the best music video since do i wanna know
Te amo ALEX
my gosh
Joder! Esto si es música ❤ Gracias Arctic monkeys por esta maravillosa melodía , los amamos ❤
i liked it even before watching
hoy recuperé las ganas de vivir
LINDÕES
Estoy llorsndo
i love this vibe so much
This is massive!
te amo artic monkeys, te amo
temazo
Me enamoré😍  Que perfección omg!!
What a video
Hipnotizing
en iyi adam.
im so excited
Like 3:00 to end…
COK ASIGIM YA
They never disappoint man !!! Can’t wait for October 21st🥲
Here after this song came out within 30 minutes
STOP I CANT WAIT TO GO TO THE NEW TOUR 😭
ARRIBA LOS ARCTIC MONKEYS
Do meu ponto de vista pessoal vou dizer: é uma obra prima!
A melhor banda do mundo de costume...
They have done it again, released a absolutely pathetic shit song their fans will try convince themselves is good
Son los mejores ! Escucharlos es como llegar a casa … ❤
Alex Turner and The Spiders from Mars?
I just love the fact that this is all filled with nostalgia. All the band coming and going both together and separate. Sort of bringing the feelings of their 20 years career... all the cinematic, Magritte's art references, just brilliant.
Masterpiece
here:)
Revivió la música
What a masterpiece from begin to ends
üüüüüüüüüü
I'm crying right now
Ptm que hermosooo temaaa❤️
Se están pasando de lanza bien cabron, los quiero un chingo
my eyes are full of tears...this was so beautiful!
No puede ser, Creo que tenemos al mejor disco musical en frente
Love the mood, very Bowie-esque somehow ❤
I’ll talk about arctic monkeys to my kids like my dad did to me with queen !
ÖLÜRÜM ÖLÜRÜM YİNE MUKEMMEL
I CANT THE BEAT DROP😭😭❤️‍🩹

Esto es música señores, que fortuna vivir en la época de los Arctic Monkeys. El vídeo 11/10, que joya!!!

Gracias por su música monos!
Estaba esperando esto, me gustan todos los discos , y estas nuevas rolas que se escuchan muy finas !
I love it ❤❤❤
The cinematography is phenomenal. The song is incredible. Alex's voice is magical
*nueva canción favorita*

YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
hermoso
Keren bgt
GRACIAS MAMA POR HACERME HINCHA DE LOS ARTIMONKIIIII
just gonna say I’m obsessed… such a masterpiece
I can't wait them to sing this masterpiece live.
Its interesting to hear Alex singing these higher notes!
This song is awesome and the video is amazing too.
2:16 ok whose vocals are these? 🤨 Matt, Louise, Alexandra?
Tuve que repetirla cómo 4 veces pero creo que no es suficiente
😐
✨
THIS IS JUST PERFECT
nice
does alex have a new tattoo?
Their music aged like fine wine and I love every bit of it❤
THIS IS SO GOOD!!!!!!!!!<3<3<3<3<3<3<3
EVERYTHING IN THIS CLIP IS ICONIC
Wow that was not good at all. Welp I’ve been a fan for 10 years and at this point I’m kind of done 😢
MEU DEUS. TO SEM PALAVRAS...
💜
AM7  IS HEREEEEE. OMG I CANT BELIVE. I LOVE U GUYS ❤
David bowie vibes
All about 2 last albums - shit. What The hell happen with The best Indie rock band? This is boring music without soul. Its very sad and dissapoint.
this definitely worth the wait
No me disgusta pero ojalá volvieran a un sonido algo más movido no como su primer album pero talvez al más AM
Me: 👀  Arctic monkeys: 🎨📽️🎬🎹🎸🥁🎻🕶️✨🚁📸🎙️🎱🍡🕰️🖼️🃏🎥🖥️⌨️🕯️🔮☢️🎶♾️  Me: THIS IS ART 🤯
4:15 mi comida en el microondas:
On. Repeat. 🤯
harika bir şarkı ve harika bir aesthetic
vi amo ma vi rendete conto
they never disappoint, excellent work
aaaaaaaaa eu peguei o dia do lançamento que orgulho  😭😭😭
I love you guuuys ❤
Panoramic windows looking out across your soul
The best part was when the guitar came out 🙌 , it reminds me of 70s Wings band
Beautiful !
God from the middle to the ending it was supreme. I can't believe it, the guitar, Alex's voice. Amazing
Épico
🎶🎸🎶
El salvavidas que me acaban de tirar 🖤
nunca me decepcionan 😿💌
Top Tune..Smashed it👊
This is just ART
This is just so beautiful
I LOVE ALL THEIR SONGS 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
VAYA OBRA MAESTRA DIOS MIOO, LOS AMO MONOS ÁRTICOS!

CARALHO
The Alex Turner voice , backing chorus , acoustic and Electric guitars , string instruments , drum ,bass  This song IS perfect , It song has All
My god this video is perfection
What are We talking about….
Body Paint 🎨 - Absolutely beautiful ❤❤❤ x
this is absolutely perfect.
To the haters of TBH+C & The Car   L
1 time for the visuals 2 times for the lyrics 3 times for the instrumental 4 times for the arrangements  5 times to appreciate the whole piece And a 6th just for the sake of it.
I love everything about this, from the instrumentation, to the visuals and aesthetic of the video... everything BUT Alex's voice.. and it PISSES ME OFF IMMENSELY cuz i want to like their new stuff soooo bad but i just cant bc of his vocal delivery :(
i love this so much
ahhh
Hoy me voy a la escuela escuchando una gran obra maestra 🥰✨
there aren't enough words to define how the song made me feel emotional, excited and amused with all its beautiful concept, lyrics, melody and while watching the video I simply couldn't help but be mesmerised about the details, the colours and how endearing the photography is and I am certain that masterpiece is the only word that can suit better to describe all that you guys did here, because everything it's just so beautifully done, that's why you guys never cease to amaze me
**suspiro de colegiala enamorada**

This album is gonna be absolute 🔥🔥
YALL BE GOIN CRAZY THESE DAYS
LO QUE ESTABAMOS ESPERANDO DESPUES DE UNA PANDEMIA, UN REGRESO TAN FANTASTICO DE LOS MONITOS, QUE COSA TAN MARAVILLOSA, GRACIAS ARTIC POR ESTE MOMENTO TAN SUBLIME. NOS VEMOS EN EL CORONA CAPITAL MI ALEX
OH. MY. GOD.
I love you
❤️🐵
Arte🍷
Hey, una vez más lograron sorprenderme; y hablo en serio cuando digo que las canciones de esta banda me sacaron de la depresión. Te amo Arctic Monkeys. Pinches rolitas espectaculares. 💕
WOW THIS IS GREAT
He was teasing this song the whole time during the tour (4:02)
awebo ijuesubutamaiser pinche rolon

Nada que decir, siempre salen con algo nuevo y no se estancan con lo cliché
EVERYTHING THEY MAKE IS A MASTERPIECE
At least I still have my memories of when Arctic Monkeys we’re good and un-pretentious
Que decepção Alex , Saudades da Época do AM onde você fez o seu nome.
vocals are under rehearsed, sounds like a demo
Omg I love this song is beautiful, the video everything is perfect. Alex's voice this man never disappoints us LOVE THIS SONG❤
certified mind blower.  jing keren banget lagi ini.
que coisa lindaaaa
los amo
The arctic monkeys are fucking back wow !!!!!!!!!!!! This was amazing
75% estético sobre un 25% musical... En fin, es mejor mirar que oír!
Que tema tan inhumanamente bueno
I was taking a university exam when the song came out, thanks to you I got 4 out of 5
🤩 wauw!! Perfectie dit!!!
SAO UNS KINGOS MESMO
AHHH, NO PUEDE SER, ESTOY TAN FELIZ 😭
I love this song, and the vibe...
WOW just wow. i live for their music.
Zzzzzzzzzzz
I don’t understand how every album is so different from each other yet so together. They have shown so much growth since 2006 and it’s incredible. It’s like an older brother who you would look up to that would always go out and have crazy stories to tell about how much trouble they got themselves into and now your both older and your brother has settled down and learned and has life experience that he still shares with you. Thank you Monkeys, thank you for coming back when we needed you most.
incredible <3
Não esperava
Please announce us tour thank you
OMG I LOVE THIS!! 🛐🛐💕
I love everything about this
Alex Turner starting to look a lot like Jeremy Fragrance's British brother John Smells
Que joya cabron
THANKS FOR SAVED MY LIFE ARCTIC MONKEYS ❤️
YES JUST YES
his voice is just something else
NUNCA DECEPCIONAN❤️
Perfect song like Alex
I wish my soul was spinning in there with this epic theme resonating in my bones
Minute 2:40 ... Just epic
No puedo parar de elogiar las piezas cinematograficas que sacaron desde tranquility base en adelante, una mejor que la otra y asi sin parar.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!! Obra de arte
4:00 H A H
Tão bom
holy. shit
:0♥️
Fucking biblical.
That voice 😫❤️
This Slaps
Solo bulutların üstünde...
Te quiero mucho Alex Turner
i want the whole album NOW!
THERE'S STILL A TRACE OF BODY PAINT, ON YOUR LEGS, AND ON YOUR ARMS, AND ON YOUR FACE!!!!!!
SO GOOD OML
😆
musikmu bagus rahasianya apa lur
so cool!!!!!!
¡Te amo Arctic Monkeys! Es perfección toda su música ❤️
Mis 3 bandas favoritas sacaron álbum este año muse el mes pasado slipknot en un día y arctic monkeys el 21 de octubre este es el mejor año
That's art! Taking chances!
YESSSSS
Macetaram muito nesse clipe
Genius - again -
Absolutely Brilliant! Could be a new Beatles era for the Monkeys?
The music is good, but stop trying to sound like a 70's band and go back to being Arctic Monkeys!
IM SO EXCITED
wow
sex
i think i’m in love
Oh i cant wait for the whole album.
Arctic Monkeys ❤️
I can't help but to think that all of Alex' lyrics are about himself and/or his eternal love for Alexa Chung.
OMGGGGGHHHG
thats my mates tanning bed at 0:58 haha
PINCHE BANDA CHINGONA
ISSO AQUI É ELITE
no puede ser, cada vez los amo más. que canción y que vídeo tan BUENOOOS
Caraca mio amigo what a song
OH MY GOD. ARCTIC MONKEYS IS SAVING MY LIFE.
DO NADA ASSIM???!?? AMOOOO!!
the spins that progressively get faster as the song gets more and more epic are insane, I can't even explain the emotion that caused me like I've been wanting to see and hear this for so long and I didn't know it. Anyways glad shawty remembered his YouTube channel password
OBRA DE ARTE
So I guess the last shadow puppets are done with. Cause like... This is just a last shadow puppets song. It's good but-
CHEMI FAVEBI
These new music videos are BREATHTAKING.
I fucking love this
Lo que necesitaba gracias Arctic Monkeys por ustedes le hecho ganas a la vida! 💌
CARALHO QUE MUSICA BOA DA PORRA MLK PORRA PQP VSF QUE MUSICA DO CARALHO MDS

Alex’s voice is just to good for this world
TRULY MASTERPIECE
This is their best work ever.
Definitivamente, hoy ganó la música y el cine.
alex looks so depressed in that shot where there are 3 of him
im on my knees for Alex Turner🧎🏻‍♀️🧎🏻‍♀️🧎🏻‍♀️🧎🏻‍♀️
Esse é o clipe mais bonito que já vi na vida
Alex Turner le ha estado metiendo durísimo a la fotografía y cine de culto. De principio a fin, es satisfactorio de ver.
Alex is the type of handsome man that could make straight man question themselves.
JUST SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY ALREADY !
omg i wanna kill myself this is so good and bad at the same time
Enamorada estoy. Enamorada! 🥵❤️
This music video is such a vibe

the music vibe feels like tranquility base 2
THOSE VISUALS   PEAK CINEMA
the music vibe feels like tranquility base 2
Alex Turner got me floating
I would go out in the street when the rain is pouring harder than ever before, if I'd know that right behind the corner by the local coffee place Alex stands below the street lamp humming anything.
Alex Turner is such a genius
a voz dele------🛐🛐🛐
_Man..._ 🤦‍♂️ these guys never disappoint, do they?!? Incredibly beautiful song and visual... can't wait for the new album!
my favorite band forever
ya allah
MY LOVE
Ele é tão nenê ❤️
I love how this sounds like a throw back to  the humbug era, AM, TBH+C, and also like something completely brand new.
Os caras são fodas👏🏽🎧  muito boa me fez lembraram das antigas 🥰
Magritte's vibes all the way around. Thanks God for Sheffield and its synergy.

Dios santo los falsetes de Alex! ❤️
El Rock no ha muerto.. gracias muchachos ❤
Debo de admitir que soy de esa gran parte de fans de los monos que no se sintió muy familiarizado con el cambio abrupto de sonido desde la era TBH&C, pero este cambio refleja madurez y genialidad por parte de Alex y compañía, ojalá sigan brindándonos más éxitos y giras como siempre nos han tenido acostumbrados, larga vida a los Arctic Monkeys! 🎸🎶🙌🏻
ITS SOOOO FUCKING BEAUTIFUUUULLLLLL omg I'm crying THIS IS ALL I EVER WANTED 😫😫
ABSOLUTELY INSANE.
pasada de verga

Alex wtf happened to ur voice???
This is something I would hear on a rainy afternoon in London
Tss me recordó a los grandiosos The Beatles, que buena rola !
Increíbleeeee
I die at 4:12
This new albums sounds like they've come back down to earth after their residency at the Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino and are touring the world with their new sound.
This is getting even better

Dayum, biggest fan here, nice song 🤯🥵😌
this sounds good but i already know the new album won't come near the prime darktic monkeys era of humbug
screaming, sobbing, crying, weeping, shedding tears, wailing, bawling, sniveling, grieving, mourning, tearing up, sorrowing, blubbering, teary, shrieking, ringing, roaring, booming, bitter, melancholy, somber, depressing, miserable, vomiting, squeamish, nauseous, queasy, repulsed, manic, insane, frenzied, demented, deranged, psychotic, rabid, crazed, delirious, erratic, idiotic, maniacal, unhinged.
Arctic monkeys siempre sacando temazos
AMAZING. JUST AMAZING. WELCOME BACK ARCTIC MONKEYS!
🥹⚡️Bowie’s Legacy Lives On⚡️✨🙌🏼 Alex’s purpose is to finish us all🤌🏼❤️‍🔥

Ciao Beatrice, sei unica❤️

They're so classy im this era im- this is beautiful
This era is going to be AMAZIBG
Siuuuuuuuu
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING OF ME, I'M PROBABLY THINKING OF YOU 😭
This tune has something so liminal and dystopian about it, especially in the beginning…. Monkeys never disappoint!!
اخيراااا
Lyrics: For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed, to lie in Do your time traveling through the tanning booth So you don't let the sun catch you crying  So predictable, I know what you're thinking  My teeth are beating and my knees are weak It's as if there's something up with the wiring You can poke your head behind the mountain peak It don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding  So predictable I know what you're thinking  Watching your every move I feel the tears are coming on It won't be long It won't be long  Straight from the cover shoot There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I'm keeping on my costume And calling a writer too And if you're thinking of me I'm probably thinking of you  There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face  So predictable I know what you're thinking
This is an immaculate work of art, I can't believe we still get the chance to experience gems like these in 2022
Que gran video
I just wanted to be one of The Strokes, with Bowie's doses. Now look at the mess you made me make.
This is awesome!!! The second half of the part reminds that rock 'n roll side we missed so much, thank you boys!
oh yes boy
I love arctic monkeys Alex's voice gives me a thousand years of life 💗
Alex just can't stop being sexy for a second. Hot hot hot !
Oh dont mind me... just claiming my early ticket here

The Writing’s Beautiful The Music Is Class Apart The Production Is A Work Of Art  There’s Better Be A Mirrorball & Body Paint Took Everything Perfect About Music & The Monkeys And Somehow Made It Even Better

Sto avendo un infarto
Necesitaba escuchar esto.
come to italy mannaggia a dio
whatever people say i am thats what im not part 2 is needed
I remember when I was the first person in my High School in Canada to discover these guys before their debut LP. Never forget somehow watching the first recorded performance of ‘I Bet That You…” in class with all of my slackjawed classmates realizing this was our band for the ages. While it has been nice to see the club grow over time, there is nothing better than being an OG fan of Arctic Monkeys and seeing the growth of the band & its members over nearly 20 years.
OMG i love it
Like a beatles.
Sin duda, Arctic monkeys revivió la música, vivan por siempre los monos árticos, viva por siempre Alex!!❤
Amooooooo
this music video is truly a cinematic masterpiece. they’re so talented that it hurts
ME ALEGRARON ESTE DÍA DE MONOTONÍA QUE LLEVO CARGANDO, GRACIAS CHICOOS, OTRA BELLA CANCIÓN MÁS QUE VA DIRECTO A MI PLAYLIST 💋💋💋💋💋💋💋
neden tarot kartıyla sigara yakarsın ki mk
Holy shit! This album is going to be glorious!
AHH I LOVE THIS SO MUCH IM GONNA CRY ARCITC MONKEYS YOU ARE THE LOML I CANNOT FUNCTION AS A HUMAN BEING IF I DONT FEEL YOUR MUSIC COURSING THROUGH MY VIENS EVERY DAYYYYY
No idea what kind of "wannabe Pink Floyd" depersonalization they are experiencing, but it's worse than TBHC
THEY DON’T MISS!!
How do they so consistently manage to release such dull and uninspiring music? It's a real achievement at this stage
Perfección
Love the song! So excited for the others! ❤
Cómo alegrar mi día en un solo paso: ❤️
GUITARS ARE BACK
Alex Turner now sounds a lot like the old creepy guy from Family guy doing a Scott Walker impression
Alex is like a fine wine, he gets better with age.
me atrapaste si es cine
The Car era is so good I am really excited for what its happening in this phase of arctic monkeys
there is not a single second of this video i dont love
this visual though! love it so much

I NEED THIS TO BE ON MY SPOTIFY WRAPPED IM STREAMING THIS EVERYDAY EVERY HOUR AND EVERY WEEK
4:20 Pião da Casa Própria! Pra ganhar é só rodar!

the aesthetic of this era>>>
Arctic Monkeys never fail to make me tear up with their beautiful music. Even if it isn’t the same as it used to be, I still absolutely LOVE it. TTBAM had me in tears, it’s just so beautiful. I’m so looking forward to The Car💗💗💗
LIINNDDDDDDDDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
WHAT A FANTASTIC SONG! LOVED IT!!❤️❤️
beautiful
Am I the only one getting a little bit of the Beatles in this? especially from 1:36 onwards
The vintage version of Submarine
So far and so close to being the things that we remember.
Rolita espectacular 🎊💞
Bowie is a live!
Hoy ganó el arte señores 🚬
what a perfection...
Amazing.
Bloody lyrical genius the violin and guitar parts hit hard it's like a mix of TBHC and TLSP and a bit of AM
LAS VISUALES, LA LETRA, LA VOZ DE ALEX, EL INSTRUMENTAL, TODO. TODO ES MARAVILLOSO EN ESTA CANCIÓN
I cannot stop listening to it, it's so amazing!! I can't wait for the album!!
COULD LITERALLY FALL ASLEEP TO THISSS 😍😍😍
This is THE song
Body Paint tastes like whisky, 70s and midnights laid awake thinking about life
The music Arctic Monkeys produces nowadays makes me calm down so much. It's really different from their early years, but still amazing and I love it.
Es hermoso!! una obra de arte este video!!!
wow! i love it!

Alex's voice is just beautiful and the whole song like damnm

I’m getting The Beatles here. What a band.
Alex te amo millones flacoo
OMGG LLEGUE TEMPRANO😭😭😭
YESSSS
i absolutely love the new vibe of the first 3 songs we've heard
Lyrics:  For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed, to lie in Do your time traveling through the tanning booth So you don't let the sun catch you crying  So predictable, I know what you're thinking  My teeth are beating and my knees are weak It's as if there's something up with the wiring You can poke your head behind the mountain peak It don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding  So predictable I know what you're thinking  Watching your every move I feel the tears are coming on It won't be long It won't be long  Straight from the cover shoot There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I'm keeping on my costume And calling a writer too And if you're thinking of me I'm probably thinking of you  There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face  So predictable I know what you're thinking
Wow, that got me

LOVE THE MUSIC CONGRATS <3
Not my taste in music, just like the last album wasn't (save a few songs). Wont buy it, and they used to be my favorite band. Personal opinion, still enjoy his voice, it just isn't my type of rock.
This music video was a masterpiece. AS A TAROT CARD GIRL THE FOOLS CARD BURNING TO LIGHT A CIGARETTE WAS ICONIC FOR ME
ARTEEEE🥰

Such a masterpiece ❤️

Hermosa canción, hermoso video, hermosa producción, hermosos nuestros Arctic Monkeys. ♥
acordes espaciales, instrumentos con reverb, una voz melódica que no hay en cualquier lado, simplemente una hermosa pieza que te transmite lo que quiere transmitirte<3  t amo macacos congelados.
I like this song a lot, but i feel saddened because it seems as if though The Arctic Monkeys are no more, this is just Alex Turner.
YES YES YES YES
Made me forget which decade we're in
Ahhhhhh❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
i'm crying mate. PLEASE STOP IT
Te amo Alex, Gracias por mucho !!
This made me so emotional because it looks like their journey in music trough the years and how far they've come!! The song is beautiful and the video is a masterpiece!!
Basta, cada canción que sacan es arte puro😻
OH MY GOD???
y no avisan
SO GOOD, PLS COME BACK TO CALI HOT STUFF  xoxo
Los tqm para siempre ❤
I love youuuuu
Mis papis
love u guys
ABSURDO QUE INCRÍVEL
OBRIGADO
There is something surreal about this song, bitterly beautiful. I have been in a low spot, in pain, but this has brought me comfort and for that I am immensely grateful.
Hoy revivió la Industria Musical y cinematográfica 👌🏻👌🏻
<3
LETRAS, NECESITO LAS MALDITAS LETRAS 😭😭😭😭
NO, I'M OBSESSED, THIS IS PERFECT. THE ARCTIC MONKEYS DID IT AGAIN Y'ALL
i am actually in tears everything about this song and video is literally perfect...
New album, New Vibe, Never Dissappointing
Siu
Es que no puedo con la perfección de estos hombres. Toda una obra maestra, de inicio a final, hoy ganó la industria de la música. Los extrañamos un chingo, gracias por volver. EN MENOS DE UN MES SALE EL ÁLBUM.
Esto es cine puro y duro!!
So pretty...work of art 🖤
yuuuupppppii
que clipe perfeito!!! música linda am nunca decepciona  ❤️🇧🇷
hot trash
This is amazing, just like There'd Better be a mirrorball. I love all of arctic monkeys' music, but how their style has evolved , is just spectacular. I remember when Tranquility base hotel & casino came out in 2018, and I was blown away by how incredible this unique style is. And now after these 4 years, I'm not disappointed, I would wait a million years for art like this, keep up the good work!
Lembrou-me a divisão e as "quebras" de "A day in the life". Putz! Melodicamente sofisticada!!
A masterpiece. Just that. 🥰
Hoy ha vuelto a nacer la música y la cinematografía revivió
Loved the Beatles-like tunes! ❤
SUCH A BANGER it's giving humbug and tranquility and like aah love this
Another lame album, wake me when you get your groove back
this is incredible 💙
arte.
Maldita sea Alex, eres tan perfecto wey!!! Me encantó la canción! Ya es mi favorita de los últimos discos. Superó facilmente cualquier rola de TBH&C.
ZZZZZZZZZZ

For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed, to lie in Do your time traveling through the tanning booth So you don't let the sun catch you crying  [Chorus] So predictable, I know what you're thinking  [Verse 2] My teeth are beating and my knees are weak It's as if there's something up with the wiring You can poke your head behind the mountain peak It don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding  [Chorus] So predictable I know what you're thinking  [Bridge] Watching your every move I feel the tears are coming on It won't be long It won't be long  [Refrain] Straight from the cover shoot There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I'm keeping on my costume And calling a writer too And if you're thinking of me I'm probably thinking of you  There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face  So predictable I know what you're thinking.
Thank you thank you thank you!!! ❤

LYRICS:   For a master of deception and subterfuge You've made yourself quite the bed, to lie in Do your time traveling through the tanning booth So you don't let the sun catch you crying  So predictable, I know what you're thinking  My teeth are beating and my knees are weak It's as if there's something up with the wiring You can poke your head behind the mountain peak It don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding  So predictable I know what you're thinking  Watching your every move I feel the tears are coming on It won't be long It won't be long  Straight from the cover shoot There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face And I'm keeping on my costume And calling a writer too And if you're thinking of me I'm probably thinking of you  There's still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face Still a trace of body paint On your legs and on your arms and on your face  So predictable I know what you're thinking
TEMAZO
