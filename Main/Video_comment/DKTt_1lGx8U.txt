Todd here - I just wanted to say a quick thank you to Ty for sharing this on behalf of both of us, it’s just too personal for me to talk about right now. Like Ty said, we’ve been spending a lot of time together as a family which is the most important thing. On a more positive note, we love how the front entrance turned out....the good news is Ty is fully onboard with distracting me with more projects. I have a funny feeling there's another big transformation just around the corner ❤
My condolences, Tyler and Todd, and to your family. What a beautiful memory! It definitely shows where Todd's ingenuity, inherent and amazing creative spirit, lies. 🙏
Couldn't you have chosen a least BORING color?
Todd - your grandfather must have been such an inspiration to you and your family. You are so lucky to have known him and been able to hear his stories for so long. My grandfather, who was much older than yours, left his farming village in Denmark when he was 14 years old and went to sea. He sailed on rigged sailing ships to many countries around the world, and sailed around Cape Horn many times. What adventurer he was - just wish I’d been old enough before he died to learn more about his life.
I`am so sorry for your los
The world lost a guardian 😪
Sooo sorry for everyone’s loss. Hugs and love to all.
I am so happy I have found the two of you and send my deepest condolences to you bothand the family 💕

My condolences Todd😢
My sincere condolences😢 to Tod, Tyler, and your whole family. Cherish your precious Grandpa's memories,  legacy, and humanity. Fondest love from South Africa 🇿🇦
Oh, Todd… read the turtle packaging wrong??  😅😂🤣
You guys I've never seen your YouTube before but now that have you and to see how y'all been working so hard, sorry 😔😐 to hear your loss I love seeing y'all together again 😢🎉❤😊
Todd, I'm so sorry to hear of your grandfather's passing.  The longer we have our loved ones, the harder it is to let them go.  I'll be keeping both of you in my thoughts.
How cool was your grandfather? What a great life he lived. You all must be so proud: rightfully so! The good thing about this is you will always have great memories of him and a hard work ethic that you can pass down to your future child/children. That's the best way to honor him. After the grieving, all of the above will help,  I promise. Too, I have a feeling he's going to be an angel looking over your shoulder 😇. Pats, rubs and hugs (not that kind you dirty boy 😘 )
Sorry for your loss 😢
I'm so very sorry for your loss. ❤
Todd my thoughts and prayers are with you & your family.🙏  Thank you Tyler for letting us know. Also what an amazing tribute to Mr Thompson. Tyler thank you for your beautiful words of your love and respect for not only Todd,but his grandfather as well. ❤
Seriously. What is the point of this vlog?  All beautiful things, flowers, food, remodels, paint, decor, mates, age, spoil and rot. Enjoy what you both have now. Btw what is the point of this ??😊

Oh gosh you two are so amazing. I didn't have my internet for over 5 months and then finally got it back and I have been trying to get caught up with all of my subscribers that I couldn't watch their channels fo sso long and I have really been having a great time. I really love seeing you two and all the beautiful things you do, I am so sorry about that other place you started to build those containers that it looked like a really nice looking home, and hopefully you will get that all figured out. Love you both, sending hugs, bye!! 😊🥰🤗💜💜💜💜

I'm so sad to hear this news. Lot's of support from myself from Belgium. I know the feeling, I still miss my Grandfather Love you guy's. R.I.P.
Wow, what an incredible grandfather you had Todd..RIP beautiful man!. ❤
❤
So very sad for your loss! I miss my grandparents and my parents. On a lighter note. I was sad to see the green go away from the entryway. I like cozy, but it does seem a little better with the tinted paint.
Dear Tyler and Todd, I am new to your channel and i am so glad I found you. Todd, I lost my grandfather back in 1997. He was my hero and I loved him so very much. I practically lived with them the first 12 years of my life. They just lived down the street. My grandmother kept me the first 9 months of my life. My grandfather was a old school man, hunter, fisherman, owned a big farm for most of their lives.  They lived on a really large creek called Oyster Creek. My grandfather and I spent many a happy hours down on his pier. We ran trotlines across the creek so there were always fresh fish to eat. We just had to watch out for the alligators, some were pretty big. All of my cousins always teased me saying we know you are their favorite grandchild, so just own it. Grandpa taught me how to fish, clean them, how to hunt and take care of whatever we got. He was also a avid raccoon hunter and he had plot hounds that were trained on coons. My childhood with them were the happiest days of my life. In 1992 I moved to Austin bexause I had always told everyone that when I grew up I wanted to live-in the capital of Texas. I made that dream come true. One night around 7pm I got a phone call that devastated me. My mom called me and said Honey we lost grandpa today. It was like getting hit with a hammer in the chest. I slid down the wall where I had taken the call at work and was lost. I broke up into tears and my assistant came and helped me back to my office. I didn't even know he was sick. My family all kept it from me because of how close we were. They knew that if I had been told I would have taken a lot of time off and gone down to spend the time with him. After the funeral my father took me aside and told me that they didn't tell me because at the end grandpa was not himself. He was not lucid and would not eat, he threw things at the hospital. Dad said he didn't want me to remember grandpa that way. So now all these years later, I still miss him and I remember the good times. I dream about him all the time. All are wonderful dreams. So Todd, while your grandfathers passing is hard, I know that, but soon you will look back and all of the good times you had will become golden and precious. I apologize for writing a book, but know time will heal the pain and bring you wonderful memories. I like your channel and will follow you guys. Many blessings and prayers.  Your new friend, Randal.
🙏🙏❤️
I'm sorry for your loss. ((Hugs))
Oh my gosh! I’m sooo glad you realized you forgot the tint of Champagne! I definitely was not liking the stark white with the wood and floors, but I didn’t want to say anything! 😂 It’s now beautiful with a warm tint and not stark white. 👍🏻 Good job! It definitely makes your entry way look bigger.
I’m so sorry for your loss Todd I can tell from the special piece that the news did on him that he was a special person.
💗
My whole house is painted white I ❤️ it . At first it felt like I was in a hospital in the white padded room 😂 that’s are joke in the house
<3 God Bless
I miss you guys. I hope that you and Todd are recovering after the loss of Todd’s grandfather. I hope to see you soon. Barry.
Bless you all, R I P Grandad x
Just ✌✌❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🇨🇦
I'm so sorry for your great loss. Thank you for sharing this with all of us. Sending strength and love your way. Mote it be❤
My thoughts are with you both, HUG!
You are in my prayers,
The fact that you two shared that ending clip was everything. ❤"When you are able to feel what someone always gave, you soon understand that they are never really gone"  -Unknown           The beautiful couple that the two of you are, is why you are so close to your families. You are an extension of them, so they are you and you are them. During this emotional time, just remain the strong couple you two are and just be present. Know that you have lots of love surrounding you both and your families. ❤
❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Love,love all the light, y'all should get Edison bulbs for your sconces.
Miss you
Getting a bit worried about you guys. I so hope you just don’t have internet ❤
Worried that there has been no post in two weeks. Hope everything is okay. Thinking of you both and your fur babies.
I’m so sorry about your grandfather’s passing. That’s gonna smart for a while. Prayers for healing hearts.  Your new entry way is awesome! The only thing that felt weird was the trim running through the bottom half of the clock . I would put that clock up above the trim that’s just my two cents lol you guys that place is gorgeous! So cozy
Your papi was so amazing. Wow you both are so lucky to have had such an amazing man to help raise the amazing and kind men you are today. I’m so sorry for your families loss.
Hoping that you guys are okay.....??......we miss you!❤
Todd, sending you and your family much love as you navigate this loss. Your grandfather seemed to be an amazing man. I hope your joyful memories sustain you as you walk this journey together!
Missing you boys.❤

Very sorry for your loss. I was extremely close to my maternal grandparents. They were like parents to me so I understand what you are feeling!
Hoping that all is well with you both. Much love to you from Mozambique 😍
The sad news also is that its been two weeks since your last video!
Are we going to get a video this week?  Really missing my T&T! ❤
Im sorry for you lose  I was wondering when you guys will be making a new video? I know how hard it is with losing someone that means the world to you.
Todd I am somewhat at a loss for words and have not written anything but now trying to write something that may bring you a little comfort at this terrible time in your life..  When I lost both my parents within three years of each other (both were terribly handicapped and I had the responsibility of taking care of them in my home for 14 years without help, when they each passed at their time I was completely destroyed. Knowing how close you are with all your family members I understand completely how hard times are for you right now.  I said a little prayer for your Grandfather and I also said a prayer for you and your family and Tyler because the loss that you have suffered based on how difficult was my loss has to be a terrible hurt in your heart and soul. Grieving is a terrible process to go through but you have Tyler and your family members to help you in mourning the loss of your Grandfather.  I have the memories of my parents stored in my memory and in my heart and they are always with me - I feel certain the memory of your Grandfather is stored in your memory and in your heart and soul and those memories and feelings will never ever fade and your Grandfather is always going to be with you. We all miss you and grieve with you during this terrible time. God bless and keep you safe and I do remember you both saying that you were not religious but my Almighty cares for all persons even those who do not believe.
🚩If you gents are not OK, please let us know what you need from us.  If you are OK, please just give a thumbs up, and we are here when you return.  We care. ♥
Rip sorry for your sad news 💔🙏🏻💐

Did you know that koi are notorious for tearing up water plants?  That's why koi ponds are plant free, unless the plants are in protective containers.  Koi might be a good way to clean out your pond. You were very fortunate to have your grandfather in your life for so long.  I lost both of my grandfathers before I entered school.  What a blessing his presence must have been.  May he rest in peach and may you and the rest of your family find comfort in your memories.
Your Grandpa lives in you Todd ❤
Ewwwww the green was a whole lot better.
I‘m very, very sorry for your loss!
Sending condolences to Todd on your grandfather’s passing.  Just before my brother passed away he told me to look for him in the rainbows. That night I saw my first double rainbow 🌈  🌈. Every rainbow sighting brings me such comfort.
I am so very sorry for the loss of your grandfather.  Grandparents are precious.  I was blessed to have mine well into adulthood. It is one of my greatest sadnesses to know that my kids did not have that with any of their grandparents.  May knowing that you were blessed to have this kind soul as family bring you comfort.
❤Hi,  Love you’re home!  It’s fantastic!  The paint looks so nice.  Thinking of you at this time.  You have lots of memories to keep in your heart Forever!
Sending My Love and prayers and hugs 🫂 to you both and the family.

I'm sad to say after the years of following you guys I need to say good bye.  I started from the beginning when it was all about RV travel....well that all changed to plumbing issues in a fancy "cabin". Don't get me wrong....I like the "house"...been there. Owned a few. I started following for the road adventure. I'm 56 now and ready to hit the road....You're posts use to be about learning to fulltime RV'ing. Now its AG this AG that....sponsor's...here and there. I miss the good old days.... "I feel cheap" Good Luck boys....good bye from BC. Canada

Cat said "Now make me a tuna melt"!!!!   hahahahahahaha
Sorry about your loss
So so sorry to hear that….but personally I don’t believe in death…..we go from here “into the next room” as it were,,,meet up with loved ones who have gone ahead , and “one day” when our time comes, we will follow and meet up and be together again. Your grandad will always be around you and can hear you. There is a reading that may help you and gave me comfort when I lost my parents and then my son ( but he comes to visit me! ♥️) Look for “Death is Nothing At All” by Henry Scott Holland. I really hope it helps you, but don’t be too sad…we WILL ALL be together again!! God bless you Todd, and you Tyler. Rest in peace Grandpa, let the youngsters do the hard work now…you just watch on, but you’ve done you share of hard work, time for a rest now. Love and Light. From someone who really understands these matters, much love. Helen 🙋‍♀️💐🥰♥️🙏😇XXXX
Thinking of you both in this time of loss.

Rest In Peace Todd's grandpa. 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂💔💔💔💔

I don't think you can ever be prepared for these moments.    I hope you and your family can find comfort in your memories.
Condolences.  Not a fan of the Pine wood. It would look better painted in the same colour as the walls I feel. But each to their own aesthetic.
So sorry for your loss. Deepest condolences to your family.
I’m so so sorry for your loss. I found your channel yesterday and binge watched a lot of your videos and fell in love with both immediately. It’s so clear you’re great people, a beautiful couple coming from great beautiful families. Grandpa was clearly an amazing person, and his amazingness will live forever through you.
So sorry for your loss.. My thoughts and prayers are with you guys and your family! <3
I initially came across you guys when looking into van builds and van life in general. I would never, in my wildest dreams imagined myself watching someone restore a car but I love following your journey. Well done on an amazing job so far. You’re on the home stretch (I hope)…. Keep it up Glen… you’ve got this👊
So glad you painted that entryway. The green screamed 80s. I love the light colour as it really updates the space and enhances the wood.

I just realized my father knew your grandfather through logging. As young kids we would go with my dad when we were off in the summer.  It was so much fun leading the horses out and hanging out with our dad. Miss him everyday.
Sending prayers
What a lovely legacy and life well lived.  I'm sorry for your loss.
Sorry for the loss of your grandfather.

Todd, I am sorry to hear about your grandfather.
Deepest condolences. Loss of a grandfather is a wound to the heart that I, too, have suffered. Your grandfather is a star in the heavens. Find his star in the sky and look up to it and tell him you love him every evening you can. It will be healing for you. He will forever be watching over you. RIP, Mr. Thompson. God's grace and comfort to Todd, the family, and all connections.
I am so sorry for your loss.He was a magnificent hard working man! 🥰
Todd, I'm so sorry for your loss. Tyler thank you for letting us know! A big warm hug for both of you❤
Just rewatching.  And had to comment, that I laughed out loud when Todd was talking about the concrete counters that he dreams of having in the kitchen.  I know the “soft” he means is in terms of not a busy, loud style but describing concrete as soft made me giggle!!

What a legacy!
So sorry for your loss of your hardworking grandfather who was such a great role model for you. Wishing you peace! 💙
The foyer turned out Fabulous ❤ I'm so very saddened to hear of your grandfather's passing. Prayers 🙏 for comfort at this very difficult time. 😥
So sorry for your loss.
Losing a loved one is NEVER easy. I’m sorry for your loss. May he rest in peace.
Love you both and your beautiful fair babies xoxox ... Sad to hear about grand dad! My God rest his soul forever ...
Very nice. WOW
My condolences to you and you family.  Sounds like a wonderful man.
It's so hard losing someone so dear.  May you have many fond memories to bring smiles through the tears.   On a nerdy note, I think powerwash simulator was too short.  Lol.  It is very relaxing!  Thank goodness for the dlcs
Not a fan of the paint color..to bright against the wood. Nope
Sending so much love! ❤️🌈❤️🌈❤️
So sorry for your loss. Sending love and hugs  from Australia and I know that you boys are making him proud with all your hard work and positivity xx  ❤❤❤❤
My sincere condolences to both of you on your sad loss.  I'm watching other videos from the new cabin. Why are you putting furniture in the basement if it floods? Anything you put down there, unless it is plastic or metal, is going to be ruined by the coming floods. Especially when the snow melts. Think this through.  Also, before you turn the cute storage shed into a bedroom, think about where you're going to put your kayaks when you're not using them. I hope you're not going to let them lay around the grounds. And what about your tools, gardening equipment, clippers, chain saw and hatchet for when you need more firewood, wheelbarrow, future boating equipment, life jackets, cleaning supplies, motor oil, ATV for getting around your property, everything you don't want in the beautiful house. I would just use it as a storage shed.  It's a gorgeous property. Enjoy!
Sorry for your loss….  Prayers for your family. Memories are the gifts left behind forever.
Great transformation!  By the way, I put a trash bag around my paint tray before pouring the paint in. When done using it for the day all I had to do was remove the bag, throw it away, and the tray was clean and ready for the next time… no cleaning!
Sorry to hear about your Grandpa. He was one of a kind.
Our thoughts and prayers are with you and your family!!!!
I'm sorry for your loss...
💛💛
Sending so much love as you all transition through the passageway of such an epic man's journey.  Planting a tree for every one taken.  THAT is a legacy.  Heartfelt condolences to all of you.
I'm praying for you and your family, Thank you for sharing that video, it really gives you a glimpse to who he was, and you don't get to meet sum body like him this day and time!💜💜💜

My condolences to you and your family. I am so sorry for your loss.
Do you Really think anyone who are complete strangers actually give a damn?
My condolences to Todd and his family and friends.😢
What an amazing man he was. I can see where you got your drive and that twinkle in your eye.
So sorry for your loss, it seems he was an amazing man. I am sure he will be missed by all. 😢🙏🏻
I don’t know how I found your channel, except maybe that last December March 2 years that I lost my grandmother who was my other mother and my world. At this point I have no grandparents left. She lost her love of her life, my grandfather two years prior to that, and slowly deteriorated over the next two years. my deepest condolences to you and your better half (husband/boyfriend/partner) like I said I’m new. This guy has a husband so that’s how we term it at my house. 😍 Again, sincerest condolences to you and your better half.
So sorry! God Bless!!❤️🕊️🙏🏻❤️❤️❤️🕊️🙏🏻
I think a man who left a legacy as tall as all the trees he planted.  So very sorry he has gone.
I am so sorry for your loss. may your Grandpa be that brightest star, shining down on you.❤
So sorry for your loss. I'm sending all my love and prayers to you and your family and friends. Losing a family member is not easy, just remember that one day you will be together once again and that he is not gone as long as you keep him in your hearts. God bless you both. You are wonderful young men and I know  in my heart that he is very proud of you both. God bless you both. ❤❤❤❤ and🙏🙏🙏🙏.
My condolences to Todd, Tyler and your family for this sad loss. Rest in peace your grandfather Todd 🙏
My condolences to the whole family. What a treasure of a man.
So sorry for your loss Todd!  Sometimes it helps to create something in your loved one's memory.
imagine using your grandfather's death as clickbait for your youtube channel. "influencers" are such narcissists, it's insane.
Very sorry to hear of your grandfather’s passing. It’s never easy. Take your time to mourn. Let your feelings out. You’re surrounded by a loving and supportive partner, and family and friends. Your grandfather sounds like a wonder person that anybody would have loved to know. I pray you get the strength to deal with your loss and may the fond memories help you find peace.
Your Grandfather seems like a wonderful man.  I love that he planted trees to replace the ones that were cut.  I'm so sorry for your loss.
Hugs and prayers. Your Grandads love will never leave you. It will continue to grow every time your share it. Thanks for sharing what a wonderful man he was.

Omg!!! Power wash simulator is so fun. I can just zone out and play that for hours
Wow. Vale Mr Thompson. You left quite a legacy. The planting of trees after taking what you need is such a powerful metaphor and symbol of legacy. As is the signing of checks 😊. This must underscore how important it was for you boys to press pause and get away with family a few weeks back. Trust your gut. P&L and strength and honey to Todd and family. C
Our deepest condolences Tod! I hope you know that your grandad lives through you❤ and that you are absolutely a wonderful extension of him. ❤
Condolences on your loss, may you all find comfort and peace in the coming days. ❤

i live in Kenya. Avocado toast is a staple at our house and in most restaurants. YES, I add things to it as well, depending on what we have in stock. Fried eggs, tomatoes, garlic & lime juice, etc etc. We have a bakery that makes sourdough bread and it is delicious on Sour dough toasted a little. OH Yum!

I’m so sorry to hear about your grandfather Todd. My maternal grandparents were the lighthouses of my family. Losing them was incredibly hard, but remembering the years I was able to share with them and all the memories I have of them makes me feel so happy. This past Friday was my grandpa’s birthday, and yesterday (Sunday) was my grandma’s, and they are so missed but we know heaven was having a huge party. We’re with you Todd, and thank you for letting us honor him along with you. 🩵🤍

So very sorry for your loss. It's just never easy to let someone go. But remember this.....they're always just a breath away, one beat of your heart.  That's pretty darn close.

Sorry for your loss 😢
I'm so so so sorry for your loss :( That news piece on your grandfather was so wonderful! What a hardworking man!
7:56 I’d rather have a plant touch my leg than a huge ass turtle! You should see the turtles at the lake our house is on. They’re HUGE and lots of them are snapping turtles. We catch them all the time when we’re trying to fish. It’s not fun taking a hook out of a snapping turtles mouth, but we do it because we want to keep them alive and put them back on the lake unharmed.
The paint has made such a huge transformation in every room/space. Love it!
I am so sorry for your loss my dear. Know that you are loved by so many people. ❤
I'm sorry for your loss,  I wish you and your family the best.
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Sending ❤ to ALL OF YOU
The clip of Todd's grandfather at the end was very special!  The entryway looks welcoming. The way you guys can put a room together is something I admire.
What a wonderful news story. What a wonderful man!  Maybe in spring, you might plant a tree in his memory.❤
Hugs, Todd 💙
Meus sentimentos 😢

@Todd and Tyler So sorry for the loss of your Pappy. He sure was a very special man and yes, Todd certainly is the apple that fell not far from that tree. Prayers of peace, comfort and understanding said for you both and your family. God Bless ✝️🙏🏻🇺🇸🥰😘
Hi I am so sorry for your lost. I know how hard to lose someone you love. My prayers and ❤ for your family.
Beautiful job. Love and prayers for you and your family.
My heart and prayers go out to you and your family.❤
I want to paraphrase something I remember when losing a loved one, "Cry not because he is gone, but smile because he was here."   Keep those precious memories close to your heart.
OMG! My son has his own pressure washing business! I’ll have to let him know there is a game he can play for relaxation. 😂😅
Sorry to hear about Todd’s grandfather passing. Family is everything.💙 The front entry way came out beautiful, love the color. I think you should move your vacuum to another room. Your guest do not need to see your vacuum, first thing.
I’m so sorry! Sending condolences to your family.  The apple didn’t fall too far away from the tree!  💗
I am so sorry for all of you. I hold the entire family in my heart and love. 💔

How lucky you are to have a man like Todd by your side. 😍
You guys can also get a new glass door for the front entrance to make it even more wider and brighter 😃
Painting without drop cloths is asking for trouble! and slows down the painting process. So sorry for Todd and his family. Mr. Thompson sounds as though he was quite a force and inspiration. I hope your memories bring you solace in your grief.
Sending love ❤
I am so sorry for your loss Todd.😢   I pray for light, love, comfort, and peace to you and your family. ❤   May your dear Granpa rest in peace.
So sorry for the loss  😞 Sending ❤️ hugs 🤗 and healing thoughts.  What a wonderful tribute to your grandfather.
Very appropriate video of Todd's grandfather! I'm sorry for your loss. The entry way looks so much better.   I use amber colored lights in my lamps in the living room, and green light bulbs in the bedroom. Currently working on getting my apartment all packed up, so the construction workers can renovate the apartment. And management has been a frigging nightmare!
What a wonderful clip on your grandfather; he is truly a national treasure. Your family was blessed to have him as the patriarch. My deepest sympathies to you and your family.🕊️
❤❤❤❤🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂

Great clip as usual... My deepest condolences on the passing of your grandfather. Condolences to all the families. BIG hugs.
My thoughts are with you at this time of loss. It is so great to see that, in some small way, you are carrying on your grandfather's legacy.
Yup, your dog is certainly ‘over’ his humans.  🤣🥰 🐶
Condolences on your loss Todd, your grandfather was an amazing person, that tribute was wonderful.  Be comforted by your memories of him.
My deepest sympathy for your loss.   Grandpa Downey sounds like a great guy.  I am sure his loss will be felt for generations!
Bear hugs for Todd, sending you lots of strength, courage and love as you walk these next days. Come back when you're ready. Love from the NEK, VT.
So sad to lose a family member but he's in a very nice place and watching over y'all. Todd, hope you can focus on how absolutely happy and contented your GF is now.   He has earned that Happy Place. That entrance was absolutely beautiful when y'all got thru with it.  It made me question why previous owners painted it dark green.  Funny that  Tyler said that about Todd being such a hard worker as I was thinking the same thing as I watched him paint.  Y'all have a beautiful place by the lake and not as much  work and tension that  you had in old place.  Hope you will update us on the old place.  Curiosity is getting the best of me.
A hearty work ethic, a  respect for nature and the love of co-workers, friends and family--what a legacy, Todd.
Awe, give Todd a hug from me, its so hard to say goodbye. Just remember Todd, he's not gone, he's right there next to you, watching over you. He can hear you, see you, and I'm sure you'll see him again. Namaste.  xxooooooo
So sorry to hear about your grandfather dying. Just remember all the good times We will keep you in our thoughts and prayers.
😢my condolences to you both
So Sorry for your loss Todd. Sounds like you and your family can cherish some wonderful memories of a beautiful soul! I hope the heaviness of not being able to make more memories with him, eases with time. So glad you have each other to lean on when times like this happen!
Sorry for your loss! The clip at then end was a great tribute, I am sure you have many fond memories of him.

Hi guys did you know you could paint with primer in it so you would only have to paint 1 coat.  Just an FYI
❤
So sorry for your loss of your grandfather, Todd. He will be remembered. As for painting, I'm sure he got paint in his leg hairs too at times. All hardworking men do. Take your time for grieving and remembering. We're all with you on this one. cheers / CS

I love pressure washing videos and doing it in real life every once on a while. That actually sounds bomb 😆😆
I am so sorry for your loss!  On a lighter note, my almost 10 yr old son loves that pressure washing game (although we don't have the virtual glasses) so much he asked for a real power washer for his birthday! 😂 there are definitely souls that calm with that type of activity...not mine though.  Lol.
✨💜🕊️✨💜✨🕊️💜✨🕊️💜✨
All the best for Todd and your whole family ❤️❤️❤️😢
My love and thoughts are with you all.
So sorry to hear your sad news 😢
Much love to you both ❤

I am so sorry for your loss. Thank you for sharing this hard working, salt of the earth, great gentleman's story that you have effectively now shared to the world, showing how we can apply ourselves and keep going regardless the number of years. Clearly your hardworking ethical grandfather was well known and beloved, and you are just like him, continuing the legacy.  Blessings to you all.
I so sorry for your loss, may you find strength & comfort in all the memories.  I lost my Mom on the 1st and then my Dad ten days later. What a shock to lose them both but they are together now and all the pain is gone. ❤️🙏❤️
my sincere condolences and prayers for your family during this difficult time. 😢

Dear Todd, my prayers are for you, your family, and Tyler.  The loss hurts but time softens the pain. The memories will keep you going. I believe that is why we were given the gift of memory. Hang in there.
I am so sorry for your loss Todd. I was always told that my grandfather drove a team of horses in a logging camp when he was 10 years old as well here in Ontario. I always thought they were mistaken about his age. After watching the news story about your grandpa, i guess i was wrong. They certainly don't make them like they used to. Sending all my strength and hugs to you both and to your family.
Losing a loved one hurts so deeply.  Sending my best thoughts and prayers your way.
My condolences to Todd, family, all the ppl who Downey touched.

Todd...  My Grampa passed away September 23rd, 1993 - he was born in 1901.  He was the best human I ever knew, and still to this day.. other than his daughter - my Mom ❤️  My life has amassed so many many amazing memories, and for that I am so so grateful.  I grew up in a part of Ottawa, called the Glebe.  I lived on First Avenue… And at the end of my little part of my street, was The Driveway.  Along The Driveway, is the Canal.  On the other side of the Canal.. was where my Grampa lived.  We had the opportunity in our young lives, to just walk down our street… And see our Grampa sitting on his bench.… And be able to just wave to him and say “Hi!” ❤️   Also on the other side of the canal… was where my siblings and I went to school.  We went to my Grampa‘s for lunch every day… And what an absolute treasured memory that was for us to have today.    His lunches - and desserts..?? OMG ❤️  He was a Baker for Canada Bread.  He made amazing treats for us.  I could write a book..  Anyways..  your book about your Grampa would be as beautiful as mine… I just wanted to share my story, because I know that your story is as wonderful.  My most heartfelt condolences to you and yours, sincerely ❤️
We are sending positive thoughts and prayers to you- especially now
So very sorry for your loss. Wishing you and your family  love, peace and comfort.
Our prayers and condolences to the bereaved family of Todd. Another angel is watching over you now

Todd my heartfelt condolences go out to you and your family. Your grandfather certainly was a hard worker. It's obvious you take after him. Lovely video clip from the local news. I'm betting you'll find a way to honor him on the land or at the new place. Hugs.

I am so very sorry for your great loss, Todd. You have the most amazing and beautiful partnership and that will help you get through this more than anything. I wish I had the words to comfort you and make it all better, but that just takes time.   On a happier note, I love that you guys sing mmm bop now and then.

Bless y'all.  I'm so terribly sorry for your loss. You have my deepest condolences. Take your time, hon. It really takes time to scar over that kind of heart wound. It'll never go away,  but you'll adapt and keep moving forward,  just as he did.
Todd, there are just no adequate words when you lose a near and dear, someone who has inspired and been a mentor for things both large and small, and just been there throughout your life.  With your Poppy, I believe every single time you accomplish a project, you'll get a pat on the back from heaven.  All I know for sure is that every time i feel that deep loss, i replace it with happy memories.  Somehow the smiles make the hurt fade.  Love to you and Tyler.  And YES, the foyer looks huge now!  Love the furbabies portrait.  Great job!
Todd, I’m so sorry about your grandfather passing. What an amazing man he was! You and your Family will be in my thoughts and prayers as you all grieve for his passing
What a great person Todd's Grandpa was, and how wonderful to have that news feature about him! Thinking about you both and wishing you the best.
I have no idea how this was put in my feed not my usual channel style but low and behold I’ve been thinking about my papa all day. He was my “favourite” person, he was MY person. I promise you everything he was will be the best in you. It takes time let it be and feel everything. You’re a good kid. 🫶
RIP 🖤🖤🖤

Of course you know we’re all sorry for your loss. Some thing I learned in life a few years ago…laughter is the best medicine. Funny, special memories is how I made it through my dad’s funeral and how I’ve made it the last 40 years. I smile big when I think of him. No more tears😉.  Hang in there, you’ve got a lot of support! Sending strength and Peace to everyone of you.

Todd, honey,  I am so sorry to hear of your grandfather's passing. He looked to be a wonderful man  and I know he will be greatly missed. I am praying for you and your precious family. May God keep you in his loving arms and grant you peace during this hard time. Many hugs and prayers, my love.
Very sorry for your loss.  May his good works in life bring you joy and pride at his memory.  Love the new entry way as well.
Guys, I'm so very sorry for your loss. I never knew either of my grandfathers as they had passed before or just after I was born so I've 'adopted' several in my lifetime to fill that void. I realized at a young age that a grandfather was so very special! They are unconditional love at it's highest level but usually with clear-sighted honesty and willingness to teach and guide. Todd, it sounds like you were so very blessed to have this great man in your life to help form the delightful person you are today. Grief with be there but overall hopefully joy at what his life gave his family will rise to the surface and spread through all who knew him. Hugs, Jules
My most felt condolences
Todd there is no words to make things easier just know I'm keeping you all in my prayers.
Todd, may your grandfather's memory be a blessing for all of your earthly days. He clearly leaves a beautiful legacy within you. 🫂💜🕊
Todd, so sorry to hear of your grandpa's passing on to Heaven. Hang on to all your wonderful memories of him.  Those memories  will get you through your toughest days.   Stay open to the unexplained occurrences you will experience as little signs from Downey that he is still around you.
I am sorry for your loss… R.I.P. 🕯️
So sorry to hear about your grandfather, Todd.  He seemed like a very special man....a true role model.
I’m so sorry 😢
I am so very sorry to hear about Todd's grandfather.  It's so very obvious that Todd comes from very good stock, his grandfather sounds like an amazing man.  Warmest regards from Texas.
May Downey Thompson RIP.  Sending you both my heartfelt condolences 🙏.  Now he’s another one of your Guardian Angels from up above 💝

So sorry to hear this about Todd's grandfather. No words can sooth the loss. Here for y'all. By the way, the entrance way looks amazing!! Lots of love from your friend in North Carolina.
So very sorry for your loss Todd! What an awesome Grandfather you had! Lifting up you guys in my heart thoughts and prayers. The front of house inside looks beautiful with the white instead of the green! Wow! So bright, cheerful and crisp! It totally feels so much bigger!

Todd so sorry for the loss of your grandfather. May all the wonderful memories you and your family have of him give you comfort. Celebrate his life!
Mr Thompson’s dedication was legendary. I did some research and he started working at the lumber company at age 15, and served for 77 years. A distinguished career who’s legacy lasts forever. May he Rest In Peace, and my thoughts go out to you two and your family during this difficult time. 🕊
I am very sorry to hear about Todd’s grandpa. Watching the video of him, he was clearly a special man. Thinking of you all ❤

🤗😰🥺 My condolences to you and your family, Todd! The news story was BEAUTIFUL, and he was truly a very blessed individual to work well into his 70's.   🙏🏻❤️‍🩹🥹 Many prayers and lots of heeling to you and yours!
I am very sorry for your loss.
Awesome video - I had a brief heart attack at the animal cut in the middle cuz of the title of the video, thankful it wasn't that.  At the same time, loosing a family member sucks no matter how you slice it, and grief is done differently by everyone, when people say time heals everything grief is not one thing  that heals by time, be it today or 10 years from today, what happens is that we grow around that grief and it gets easier every day because of that.   Now this is coming from someone who no longer has parents or grandparents on this planet, and I'm 33 years old. Take it one day/minute at a time, and yeah be there for who needs the support, but also take the support if you need it.
I love this whole video  !
Todd, please accept my deepest sympathy for the loss of your beloved grandpa. My grandpa was also an original Forrester in Australia. tents, horses, and tough men. (I'm 80. so you know how long ago that was) I hope you find peace in his passing, a truly wonderful man.
Todd, I totally get those feelings, dear. When I lost my grandma 10 years ago this month, I couldn’t talk about it much for a really long time. Grandparents are a very special kind of love! Sending you so much love and support right now!  ❤
Sorry for your loss
Todd, I am so saddened at the loss of your grandfather. The love we share with grandparents is truly like no other. Hugs to all.
You guys are making your home so cozy and beautiful! Sorry to hear of Todd's grandfather's passing, but what an AMAZING man he was. I have so much respect for anyone that gets things done and is a hard worker....such a great story about him.
So sorry for the loss of your grandfather ~ hugs & prayers to you both. Cherish the memories.   ❤
My condolences to Todd and his family.  The good thing is that the family has always been close and together you all will weather this storm.  Also, the entryway looks great.  Love you guys sense of style.  Take care.
I did my whole home in Chantilly  Lace and I love it. It's a neutral white
The new paint looks good makes the room look bigger the front entry room looks good love the family animal Painting
My condolences to Todd and his family. All of love from Bryan in Lodi NJ USA ❤😔🥺😭🙏

Hey! For aquatic plants, my husband got a giant grabber thing with blades from Amazon. He pulled A ton of stuff  and put it on the sandy soil garden, great nourishment . Jenlis Weed Razor express. I was kinda concerned about the blade aspect , it was safe, kinda like a GIANT scissor. You guys are fun and inWANT TO LEARN ABOUT HOW YOU AND YOUR PARENTS GET ALONG SO WELL. I have 4 kids 37-42 + spouses+ 9 g’kids.
I am sorry for your loss. Take time to greive, it's really important. Love to you and your family.
Hello you two, when you first showed us the new house, I thought to myself…Hope they paint it a whitish colour, the wood would POP!!! ..thanks guys !!!!😊👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼🫶🏼❤
I would like to extend my condolences to you both and your families. So sorry for your loss Todd.
Beautiful tribute!
There are no words.  Just sending love and blessings.   Take your time and grieve with your family.  My grandmother (gone 18 years now) used to say “If it doesn’t hurt when they go, it wasn’t love.”  That was one of the only things that ever helped me make sense of the levels of pain loss causes. Give your grief its due until the loving memories carry you through.❤❤❤
😘😘❤❤
❤❤❤
Sending condolences from Alaska..... take the time you need to celebrate just an important person in your lives and the time together.

A lovely tribute to an incredible grandfather. Not just the news clip either. That his legacy of values lives on in others, especially you, Todd, speaks more than any biographical segment could. Take all the time you need before jumping back on here. Those of us who've been there, know and the rest will find out soon enough. Rise In Power Mr. Thompson.🕯🙏🕊🌠🌈

My sincere condolences to you & your family for the loss of your grandfather. ♥️🙏🏼
Usually exposed wood heavy spaces arent for me, but, WOW what a different that paint choice made! It's looking so nice and light. And your styling helps pull it into a more modern space too (and who doesn't love a bit of greenery to lift things up - I don't trust people who don't have plants inside.)   Sorry for you loss ❤ your grandad looks like an awesome guy to have had the privilege to get to know.
So very sorry for your loss. It’s been 10 years since my Mom passed. I wake up every day and say good morning to her. It never goes away😢
I'm so sad to hear of the loss of your Grampy. My deepest condolences to you and your family.  Sending all my love... Jen from New Brunswick

Big cosmic hugs Todd and Tyler. Grampa seemed to have been blessed to live a long and prosperous life with tremendous love around him. The news reel was really neat too.

My sincere condolences to you Todd and your family. The memories you have with your grandfather will be forever in your heart. May he rest in peace  🕯️💔🙏
What a nice tribute that news feature was on Downey.  He sounds like a man I would have loved to have as a relative.  My Grandfather passed when I was 9 years old, but I remember him dearly. It is a testament to Todd and his family that Downey was thought of so well. I can see how Todd and his Dad have the same work ethic. I just had a dream last night that a longtime friend who passed a year ago was sitting on the side of my bed and we were reminiscing about fun times and places we enjoyed.  I hope Downey contacts Todd in the same way. It makes us realize that we must savor every day as if it were our last. My love to you, Todd and your family in this time of sadness. Celebrate his life - that is what matters. -- Randy  ❤❤❤
Aww. I send a hug. It looks like you have an amazing family. May you find many memories to bring some moments of happiness during this feel of loss time.
😢😢😢😢 I am so sorry for your lost Todd and Taylor.  He is your guardian  angel 😇  to you and your family
I’m so sorry for your loss. You guys are so fun to watch and inspiring. ❤
Condolences, may Grandpas memory be a blessing.  🙏
Sending healing thoughts and prayers for all the families, Todd's grandfather was a true legend. Saddest times for sure. I grew up in Enfield, and Elmsdale lumber was an icon back then too. Everyone knew everyone. I'm now in Reno, Nevada, but miss my hometown area always so much. Hugs and love Todd, Tyler, and families and friends.😢
🙏🙏🙏🙏
Todd so very sorry for your loss, stay strong and know that you are loved.
So sorry for your loss.  Wishing you positive energy while you go through this difficult time.  ❤

Todd so sorry to hear about the loss your grandfather. My dad just passed away a couple of weeks ago. I love the video of your grandfather and the old pictures of the men working in the woods. My family homesteaded on the Olympic Peninsula so I have lots of old photos of my grandfather and my father when he was a boy harvesting trees and moving wood through the forest with oxen and horses. Such incredibly hard work. They don’t grow men like that anymore.

I was once asked what I thought happens to us when we die ... my answer ... "I don't know, it's a mystery. But what I do know ... is that those who love us will miss us." It's one of the hardest things we have to face in life ... losing those we love and care about. Wishing you and your family love, comfort, peace and healing. 🕊🤍

(Oh, and the entry way looks fabulous!😊)

First, Todd and Tyler, you have my condolences in the loss of Todd's Grandfather.  The piece you shared; shows just how much of an icon he was in your community.  Not many people make such a big impression on their community and family.  You mentioned during the video that you are thinking about a concrete counter when you do the kitchen; before doing that, research the problems people that have concrete countertops are having with them.  The concrete countertops are falling out favor because they stain so easily and the stain can't be removed because concrete is porous and permanently absorbs the stain.  Some things that permanently stain are red wine, oil, red beets, etc.
I know your pain Todd. I lost my grandfather years ago and l still miss him. He was my best friend. I look bavk and think about him and l catch myself smiling and some of the things we did together.  I know the pain will slowly leave and you will miss him, but as long as you have memories, he stays alive in your heart, until you see him again. My condolences to you Todd, and of course to you Tyler.❤🙏🙏🙏😢
Todd, I’m sorry to hear about your grandfather. He was obviously a well loved gentleman. He will be watching over you and your family. Hugs. 💖
We just got meta quest 2 and I love it!

Oh Todd, I am so sorry to hear about your grandfather. Sending hugs and prayers for you. ❤❤
He seems like he was such a treasure. I’m so sorry for your loss. My grandpa was my biggest hero. He had had a bunch of strokes by the time I was born, and I spent many hours at their house. We would play checkers together when I was about five. Part of my “job” was to make sure the match that he used to light his pipe went out so it didn’t burn his fingers. Grandpa and Grandma homesteaded property in Montana, but after a severe drought and the loss of newborn twin boys, they packed up and came to Minnesota. Grandpa dug out a full basement under the house they bought, using a pick and shovel and wheelbarrow. The soil was green clay, so it was backbreaking work. He also built a second story on the house and made an indoor bathroom. Even after the strokes, Grandpa would do his darnedest to eradicate the dandelions, getting down on his hands and knees and using a knife to dig them out. They survived the Depression and raised three girls and a boy in that house. They lost their son on Iwo Jima (in the Pacific during WWII) when he was just 18 years old, which devastated them. My grandpa was a simple man who worked incredibly hard for his family, and he will forever be my hero. Todd, may you cherish the memories of your grandfather. What a work ethic!!
Our thoughts are with you and your family during this difficult time.
Prayers for this family ❤
❤My heart goes out to you and your  family. I lost my husband and  my mother both Feb. 22 on different years. I only am able to tell you that you will always have.your memories and that is a true blessing.  I will leep you and your family in my prayers .

Entry looks beautiful - I hope it gives some joy to walk through during this time. Your grandpa seems like an AMAZING man - how many of us will get a news clip of trying to save the world when we pass?? If you are up to it (and totally ok if not), write down or discuss your favorite memories of him ❤ I’ve had a bunch of losses in my life, but celebrating all the best times one more time makes the tears a little less bitter.
When I saw the headline, I thought one of your precious animals had died. But I just looked up the obit for Downey Thompson … so beautifully written and what a totally cool and special person.💔 Sadly, life ends for us all.🥺 Sending love, for life is for the living.❤
You are both in my prayers.  Your Grandfather must have been so proud of you for all the work you have done together all these years.  What a fantastic way to keep him near and dear to your heart, with each project you complete.
So sorry for your loss, sending condolences ❤

My grandfather bought a 300 acre farm by crawling on his belly digging out coal in a coal mine.  That farm was in the family for over 150 years and all of it has been sold except for the 7.25 acre farm, that belonged to my parents but, since the death of my brother, I live here alone, except for the last of my 3 cats, but the farm belongs to my sister and myself.  I live here to keep part of grandpa's farm in the family and to tell the family stories and history to future generations. Except for one 91 year old 1st cousin, on my father's side of the family, my sister and I are the two oldest living members of the family among the rest of our 1st cousins.  With my brother, I took care of my father when he passed 43 years ago, my mother  as she passed 13 years ago and just 3 years ago, I was at my brother's bedside when he took his last breath.  I felt honored to be a caregiver for them.  I have lived here for 20 years, selling my house, in the city, I had owned for 48 years. Todd, I understand the pain you are going through and know how you will miss your grandfather.  My brother had lived here with me for 17 years before he died and since he made me in charge of pulling the plug when he became non responsive, I miss him more than words can ever relay and I still find myself eager to tell him something until I remember he is gone.  Todd, it never goes away, though it will get better.  They continue to live within us as long as we remember them, the good, as well as the bad. Peace and love to you and Tyler in this sad time.
Our hearts have broken for Todd and his entire family.  We've enjoyed Todd's family, their sense of humor and their never ending support of each other.  Thank you Tyler for letting us know, and much love and positive energy is being sent your way.  I and one of my sisters took care of my dad for the last two years of his life.  My dad, like Downey, was a FORCE.  He loved his family, he worked so hard and, as difficult as it was, I was grateful to be able to care for him until the very end.  Even though we knew it was coming, when he did pass, it was completely devastating.  I helped arrange his memorial, the military guard 21gun salute and presentation of the flag to mom, the notices and all.  Then the day got here and it all came back, I was completely unable to talk about him and everything he meant to me.  I thought it would be a bit of a relief, but that final goodbye was harder than ever.  I'm a military veteran myself and have always considered myself a very strong and stoic person, but not so much when it comes to losing family.  I still miss him horribly, but I now for a fact he lives on in me.  I see and hear glimpses of him frequently.  Todds love for his family, and their love of him, will continue on for the rest of his life.  This is their forever gift they've left for him.  One day you both will have children and you will see how, when you parent, and you talk to your children, you can still hear your own grandfathers, grandmothers and parents, coming through you to your children.
You guys are funny when you relax together. Thx
So sorry for your loss, may he rest in peace.
By your side boys. Love
I'm so sorry for your loss.  Sending you peace, love and comfort

I am so sorry. God Bless.
It's okay, Todd. Take your time. My better half will turn 88 in a few weeks. Every Sunday I hear the same thing: "Any word from 'our boys'?" I go pull up your latest and we watch together. He loves you both. I saw him get a little misty-eyed watching the reel of your grandfather's life work. They were both cut from the same bolt. He's still actively raising cattle and has a huge garden he tends to every spring. It's what keeps him going. We offer our sincere condolences and gratitude to him for the work ethic you've inherited. Thanks to you and Tyler for sharing your lives with us and spreading a little joy. Love from Kansas City, MO.
Sorry for your loss praying for you and your family
He is with the ancestors.   Cherish all the memories and life lessons taught.   I wish you both peace as you all gather and share love and stories.   The older we get family will transition to the ancestral place to watch and care for us.  ❤
May his memory bring you peace and joy
so sorry for your loss.
Thinking of you during this difficult time. 💐❤️
I am sorry for your loss.  Todd, you are so lucky to have had your grandfather all these years.  I lost my grandfather when I was eleven.  You could always plant something special in honor of your grandfather.  Perhaps a special tree or do something on your property that he would have would have enjoyed.  .
Keep the memories close to your hearts and continue to share your love with the world.
So sorry to hear that.... Great paint job.
Very sad news, but what a great tribute to Todds Grandfather. We all have to deal with family deaths, it's not easy, but we get by and the memories are with us for ever. Take care Todd, we are ALL thinking of you, and of course your Mother and other family members. Tyler will see you through - time for more Avocado on toast, and a glass or two of wine ! Take special care 🙂 X X X X

My deepest condolences to Todd, and you also Tyler.😢 Grief, I’ve learned, is really just love. It’s all the love you want to give, but cannot. All that unspent love gathers up in the corners of your eyes, the lump in your throat, and in that hollow part of your chest. Grief is just love with no place to go.                - Jamie Anderson
I'm so sorry for your loss, Todd.♥

Yeah,  that’s not ok… that’s not the kind of news that you use to bait us into staying till the end.  I’m disappointed in you.  Really…  Using the death of a loved one to get me to watch till the end?  Yucky , I have followed for years but suddenly I feel manipulated

The paint job is stunning. An incredible transformation.  Amazing what a little paint will do.   So sorry to hear about Todd's grandpa.  It's so hard to lose them. It's wonderful that you all had so much time with him. It is never enough.  My grandmother has been gone for 40 years now and I still choke up when I talk of her for very long.

Sorry to hear of your grandfather’s passing. I can totally see where Todd gets his go-getter, can do attitude from. Sending you both so much love and light.  The entry way space turned out incredible. I’m liking this room-by-room facelift thing!
My prayers go out to you both, and extra ones for you and your family, Todd.  I just want to hug you both.  Grief is different  for everyone.   Never let anyone  tell you how to grieve.
I love the color of the entry❤
I'm very sorry for your loss.   It's never easy losing anyone you are so close to.    As time passes, I hope your memories stay strong as well as the love in your heart.    Take care
This video was almost hard to watch because Todd was so happy in the beginning and then got the rug pulled out from under him. I feel so bad because I'm sure his grandfather was a big part of his life. Like a lot of us our grandparents were our "adult buddies" when we were kids. Kinda like a parent, but way more fun. I hope as the sorrow lessens he can look back on his grandpa's life and all the wonderful memories he has of him and smile.
My condolence. Praying for your family and love ones
I am so sorry for your loss. Hugs to everyone
❤
So sorry for your loss. ❤

Todd, consider yourself enveloped with love and tender care. Losing your   Grandpa who has grown with you, embraced you for the man you have become, has shown his love for Ty while he watched you two meld your lives into such a healthy relationship. I admire all your parents and know they will help you through this part of your journey. I am so glad you recreated your entry into a warm, welcome space. Todd, I believe your grandfather would enjoy the change. Ty, you such a loving partner, I know this was difficult for you as well. Much love
❤️
Losing someone you love is like a punch in the gut that takes your breath away. I’m so sorry for your loss Todd. I didn’t know your grandfather but I know he must have been glorious to have a grandson like you.

Maybe have an Accent wall in Olive..it fits and rebalances the Space..White, the two-tone approach is safe and is timeless..a sound choice, sober.. and possibly cold in Northern Climes..in Morocco, in Mexico, and in strong-lit rooms, it's Great. Sending you tacos and kisses..next time in Mexico, check out Morelia...a town built by Italians with an Italian Feel from the Cathedral to the Buildings...also, no handholding there but Gays in Mexico are quite accepted mainstream nowadays...but it is catholic heritage has strong roots there..but the traditional wisdom has often dealt with it with compassion, understanding, without Judgment. Maybe, Puerta Vallarta is more your Vibe..but many gringos there..more costly ...lol..tHere is a fun Hostel, run by a Gay Yoga Teacher with a Dog in Guadalajara..Kush Hostal, with a swell roof terrace and Alexxa music throughout.,..lol
Todd, Your heart is filled with the memories. I can say for sure that in time those memories will fill you with laughter and smiles at any given moment. Knowing he will be missed, remember he is in Gods hands and he smiling down upon all his family. You have  blessed Todd for having him in your life.
Todd very sorry for your loss.  Prayers and Blessings be you and your family.🙏❤️🙏🏻

I'm so sorry for uour loss Tod.  My deepest and most heartfelt sympathy.  I didn't know Downy was your grandfather, but i can say there will never be another like him.

If you do go for concrete work tops give them a coat of resin to stop chipping and make easier and more hygenic

condolences for Todd and his family.
Sending lots of prayers so sorry for you're loss...
I'm so sorry to hear about Todd's grandfather.  My heart goes out to Todd and his family for their loss.  I guess the only thing I can say is this:  I lost a beloved grandmother and, although I knew she was old and frail and I knew the end was near, it was still so hard.  It does pass, though.  The grief.  I still miss my Nana but it's the memories that carry me through.  I can now think back fondly on all the times we spent together and appreciate all the things she taught me.  Todd too will get past the grief.  Family together helps.
So sorry to hear about the loss of your grandfather Todd. It is never easy losing a loved one. Hang on to those beautiful memories that were made over the years. He will live on in your hearts forever. Sending loads of love & Hugs to you & your family. 💕
So sorry to hear about Todd’s grandfather. Prayers for you and the family.
So much love to you both. Todd please don’t rush into new projects without allowing yourself the time and space for grieving and healing. Give yourself grace to do things that bring you joy even if they’re not productive.
😿
How special that you would share the grandfather’s life. Of course all of our thoughts and prayers are for you.   Time of sweet, recall, and healing.   Your entry reflects you both❤
Amazing what a difference white/light paint makes.

I cracked up when Todd began to virtual paint! too much!
My deepest condolences to you 🕯
So sorry for your loss.  You are both in my thoughts.  What a wonderful man he was!
Concrete isn't a natural material. It's manufactured. It's one of our options for counters so curious to see how you guys like it.
I am so sorry for your loss, your grandfather seemed like a sweet man
Sending virtual hugs. I'll tell you what I tell my friends and family: one's soul is made of memories. Keep his memories alive, and his soul will remain with you. Hang in there. ~Maarten
RIP Downey Thompson but from what I get you lumber wood and plant trees in heaven now.
I like lemon juice on my avocado.
My father was also a tree guy a wholesale tree farmer we’ve created a beautiful memorial around Oak tree
Love how much brighter the entryway is, and that painting of the boys and squirrel is awesome! Wa hat a wonderful and thoughtful gift, I’m happy you were able to find a spot to display it so you can see it every day…that’s the best way to thank someone for such a gift.  So sorry about your loss, Todd.  He seems like he was a wonderful man with a fulfilling life of meaningful work and family.  ❤
Todd, so sorry to hear about you, Grandad, but it sounds like he lived a fulfilling life doing what he liked to do.  He's just fine hanging out in heaven; it's the ones who are left behind that feel the loss.  May good memories replace the sad feelings over time.  Peace to you.
So sorry for your loss ❤
My deepest condolences to you both & your families.

I am so sorry Todd, my grandpa was a lumber jack in East Texas, so was my father when he was young! The entryway looks awesome guys! ❤❤❤

Sorry for your loss Todd. His trip to the spirit world was pure, the tree gods came for him.
My thoughts towards Todd & family, I unfortunately lost both of my parents and as a gay man I had a bond with them. Take the time as time will be needed to wrap your head around life. ❤️ from Montreal towards your clan.
🤗 ❤
Funny how we think we will paint our walls crazy colors we like when it's OUR home.  Whites & lights have been my go to.  lol  I was out on a little fishing boat my bio dad had & jumped into the middle of the lake.  I was out so fast the top of my head was still dry!  The plant life was nuts!  I'm sure it's fine for those that don't mind.  I'm glad for the memory, he was killed 2 years later.  I just lost my uncle which was sudden & it's been so hard for me coming only 4 days after a dear friend.  I so feel your sadness & loss, at my age it comes way too often.  You can talk about it when you're ready, I've had 2 weeks & I'm not ready for even as much as I've said. Sending you some loves & hugs.
Sincerest condolences to you all and especially to Todd and his family. Hugs to you all. The hall looks a lot brighter and more homely now that it has been tittivated. I wonder which room is next on the list?
I’m so sorry for your loss😢 God bless your family I just lost my father in November. It’s so nice to have them for a long time but it’s so sad.
Sorry for your loss. They don’t make then like him anymore. My father was like that.
you boys do good work! great planning on doing one room at a time. love your new space!
My condolences to you and Todd and your family.  My heart is with you all ❤
<3

Just a thought, before you decide to use concrete everywhere maybe check out what a destructive material it is and how bad for the planet. The Guardian has an interesting article on it.  Concrete: the most destructive material on Earth
sending warm loving vibes....
So sorry for your loss my thoughts and prayers to you both and your family
My heartfelt condolences Todd and Family!
Take ALL the time you need to grieve, don't worry about vlogging. Family First! Get a copy of the news report so as time goes by you can still see and hear your Grandfather. That's a precious gift that he is so loved by everyone  that he was on the news. Much love to you both. 😢
This message is for both of you but mainly for you Todd, I watched the news snippet about your grandfather and it left a tear in my eye, I couldn't be prouder to have the same surname as the legend you call "Pappie" may his amazing soul rest in peace. You guys are awesome
Im so so sorry for your loss. Take your time and remember the fun and great times your family has had. Big hugs.🦋

Hi i am very sorry that your grandfather passed away he had a great life byrobert
Thanks for the lovely vlog. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, here too. May you all be comforted by holding on to each other. See you in two weeks.
So sorry for your loss, ❤
This may be a parasocial relationship, but I am thinking of you and sending you all so much love at this difficult time. His memory will be forever a blessing to you.
No, no...your approach was spot on. Doing all the white at once would have worn you out! Doing sections is very smart. You know what they say about how to eat an elephant... I can kinda see the thinking behind the green, but the white walls look so classy...nice!
My thoughts and prayers are you both. I'm so sorry for your loss.
Sorry to hear about your Poppy. Sad news.
Sending love and hugs and the hope all our ❤ will help you both in this trying moment!
Sorry for your loss.

what a beautiful tribute to remember him by. I feel for Todd- my Grandfather (whose last name was Thomson too --without a p) was the only father figure I had growing up and it was all I ever needed. I feel for your loss.

Love you boys, sending Todd and his family all the warm vibes ❤
I’m so sorry for your loss!!! ❤️❤️❤️🎶🎶🎶❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
May he rest in peace ❤
Love the uplighting on the wood. Not a fan of the white walls. The white has too much of a cold undertone that doesn't jibe with the wood.  I would have chosen a color that more or less matches the lightest parts of Charlie's fur.
What a wonderful tribute to to his grandfather. I’m sure he is flying high in heaven. Biggest hugs both of you ❤️❤️
Todd,, what a tribute to a wonderful man,, love you both 💋💕💕
I’m commenting before the serious part. Lol Todd is so dumb funny and cheesy I just love it!!   You know he’s book smart too! But he’s a fool 😂
Praying for peace and comfort for your precious family. May you find comfort in the memories you have. Hugs 🫂
I’ll comfortably say, you are wrapped in all of our arms.
My sincere condolences. May Downey Rest in Peace.
Awwwww my prayers are with your family Todd. Also the front entry way looks amazing!! ❤❤❤❤

I'm so sorry for the loss of your grandfather ❤ please take the time you need to grieve Todd❤
The two of you are so refreshing, lovely and decent - I am so appreciative to have come across you on YouTube.  FYI- a channel I think you and others might enjoy (as I and many others do) is "PJ and Thomas". Great people, beautiful family. They live in Tennessee,  decorating,  flipping, raising a family, running their farm, all amongst extended family as well.
So sorry for your loss. Family is the most important ❤
My condolences. Grieving is the price we pay for profound love. 💔
So very sorry for your loss
I haven't even started yet and I'm like "Oh goody it's the boys!" 💓💙💚💛🧡❤💕💞

Love you guys!  My heart is with Todd and you and hopefully the good times will prevail. Stay strong and KNOW A LOT OF FOLKS SUPPORT YOU!
I'm so sorry for your loss. Will keep you in prayer.
I lost my dad two years ago. He wasn’t sick, it was sudden and I still can’t believe I won’t see him on this earthly world again. The best thing any of my friends gave me was “Grief never goes away, we just find ways to deal with it better”. I talk to my dad every night, and it’s very comforting. I hope you find comfort and peace ❤🫂
Sad news but it sounds like a life gloriously lived. He has passed the torch of life to you now Todd; run with it held high, with dignity and courage, and guard its flame for those who will come next. Xx
Ooooo! So much brighter! And I’m so sorry for your loss. My heart is with you boys. 💕

Love and prayers from Granny Gladys in Virginia. No, I couldn’t make the  wedding.  I am just getting over a hospital stay for respiratory failure and acute anxiety. I couldn’t make the flight.

Todd here - I just wanted to say a quick thank you to Ty for sharing this on behalf of both of us, it’s just too personal for me to talk about right now. Like Ty said, we’ve been spending a lot of time together as a family which is the most important thing. On a more positive note, we love how the front entrance turned out....the good news is Ty is fully onboard with distracting me with more projects. I have a funny feeling there's another big transformation just around the corner ❤
Sending you ❤️
