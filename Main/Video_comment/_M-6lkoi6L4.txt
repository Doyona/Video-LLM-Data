This is ass like all your other songs
Mentally, I'm still here and I never left
4 years later, still a banger. And still very true. I've been procrastinating a lot on what I wanted to do because it seemed too hard. Then I finally mustered my courage and went for it, and now I've been streaming for 1 year and had the opportunity to spend some lovely time with people, instead of falling into the VTweeting trap. As Mori says, it's hard. But you gotta do what you gotta do to do what you want.
this is cool
Not everyone is meant to be a singer
Still a banger years later!!!
Missed old days
Violent, and a diss track for those crazies on Twitter?  I like your style.
What a violent fun banger
ts is so ahh
Four years ago this song made me stick with the college I got into. Now, I've graduated and I'm a certified biomedical engineer Thank you Calli
4 years later, and I still listen to this to get myself motivated to keep creating, to hopefully get my chance to fight at the mountaintop
This song just gave me a completely different perspective after all the news
Awesome, I'll Be Swingin' 7
Still My FAVORITE❤❤❤
Omg you murdered that beat. Your flow and flow switches are sick as Fuck. You slayed it Jesus.  Omg MORE MORE MORE! I GOT THIS ON ME PLAYLIST NO CAP!!!!!!
ts sht is js corny asf 💔🥀🥀
Listening to this banger in 2025!
This has Liquid Sword vibe.
Thanks master, I'm going to make history.
Not a big fan of rap. But Calliope spits fire.. This is so good.
I keep coming back, it's so good.
OFFU WITH YOUR HEADO
here from pippa definitely Eminem and Hollywood Undead pilled
ヨツユ様！？（FFIVX）
かっこよすぎですね✨
Love the jab at Twitter basement dwellers: "You want a balanced following? Then start creating , stop tweeting."
髪の毛が彼岸花みたいできれい。
morii says rip and tear  doom slayer loads shotgun
Still traumatized
The reaper has done it again bringing another banger to the table I’ve always been a fan of your music calli it just sounds awesome
still sick
You wanna stand with the best you have to act like the best. As she says, start doing, stop wishing.
The endorphins that flooded my brain while listening to this...
The storm have passed. See me calli. See me on the other side
Yagooooo
I love her so much
Tell calli i
Listening to this again, you notice how cultured calli is from the lyrics...
Mori peaked here
I like how this song never gets old, it's almost atemporal
wtf why is this on the ymfah playlist
2024 and still fire 🔥
I love this song
the only way to describe the beat is 🔥🔥
To all the haters, keep it up down there, we're on top now, new album's coming. 🔥
The amount of motivation this song brings is insane
3 years this song has been out, and Twitter never got over it 😂  Sasuga Reaper indeed
Booooo 🍅🍅🍅🍅
dope😊💖🎉
3 years late i still loop this song every time y need to crunch some work
Here after the antis getting mad over mori cuz of the kendrick and drake beef for some reason😂
how did i get this after Red Flags?  (nice song but how XD)
Another favorite VTuber 😌❤
0:53 that's some nasty snares
This is a great song again reminding everyone about what goes on behind the curtains in the entrainment industry. Keep fighting the good fight Cali!
The cacophony of that loud metallic BANG during the "Welcome to the Mountaintop" section is so so perfect for that section! It's hard to listen to... just like the advice that she's giving, but the more you listen to it, the better it sounds, and the easier it is to follow.  Whoever made that brave decision deserves a raise!
She sound just like Demondice, Is there any relationship between them?
2024!!! I still like this song
How did they do that with the captions
"You can't be strong if you give up from just a miss in ya streak." That line really speaks to me; it's why I keep working on things and pushing myself, well, it's one reason, but it's a good one, and my favorite line in the song, apart from:  "Expect no less than Earth shaking when these Dead Beats rise" the delivery for this one TO THIS DAY gives me goosebumps!
This is probably one of my favorite music videos. Calli cleverly and clearly expresses her feelings through this song すごいすぎ
I think the vtubing scene would have some pretty big holes without this song.
Am I hearing the Thieve's Forest Theme song from Castle Crashers in the first 30 seconds of the song?
Success is both hard work and opportunity. But what a lot of people forget is that hard work is what invites opportunity to your door.
Two years later it hit me. This song’s message is “it took me ages to get here, and it wasn’t easy. You can try too, but “the stage is crowded”, but i dare you to try”
This is seriously her masterpiece needs more mention these days!
This may honestly be my favorite song of her's. The message behind what it takes to be an entertainer is so accurate form what I've seen and herd in this world which is why I know I would never want to be one no matter how tempting it might be some days these lyrics slay!!!
<3
これに惚れない人間がいるのだろうか
Still So Beautiful   Amazing Memories  Thank You  So Much Comfort  Hope You Make Songs as Great as This Again  Draw’s Out My Love  The Comfort Of Man Know’s No Bounds
I Tought This song was about the Punk Band from Minessota. Ryan Young are you hearing this? There is a song with your name......
This is without any doubt your best song!
i feel like there's no way of escape from this reaper,, i must say it's so cool so that I find myself  getting into the rhythm every time i  listen to this song!
Ok, Bet.
cool
I love this song it should be number one ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I offer to you my head, my soul already belongs to you \orz
a
She’s the girl from Friday night funkin
has anyone ever told u that u sound like demondice?
Am I the first one that decided to let the AI control itself and let it build itself
俺はこの声が好きだっ！最高だ！
New listener, and this was the first song of yours I heard, Calli.  I think you've already made me into a fan. Looking forward to hearing more of your music!
I just realized that this is all English for the Twitter weirdos who were complaining about Callie
In this picture, Ms. Calliope's eyes are like stars.  Real far apart.
The curse of oyasumi is even there. And twitter is already dead. It's X now
Oh my god why does this song full on slap
the amount of hypocrisy in this is unreal
Can’t wait to join you
What a fire of a song!!
Do caralho
cool
After all those years, this is still my favorite
this song just came next and I have to wake up, stand up, and turn off the freakin thing
2 years and they're still just tweeting without any sign of creating anytime soon. forever debut:tba kek
This chick is fucking heavy! 🤘🏾
this was the longest 3 minutes of my life jfc
2 years ago(well more like one and a half year ago) I started streaming thanks to this song. Just recently, I was feeling down due to several "misses on my streak" and been losing steam. Coming back to this song relit the fire in me. Thank you Calli. While they are weak swings, I'll still keep on swinging.
Prime Calli
This has become imo the vtweeter disstrack
i wish Calliope Mori was in real life and she married me loves me passionately she's addicted to me
The years will pass and this song will never get old
2 years already
love the skills and hot fire songs
I hereby claim her music as its own style. Reaper Style. 💀💀💀
This is the first song im listening to from you.. im amazed! I love everything about it! Definitely gonna binge your channel now, off to my playlist!
I’m 38 touched three corners of the earth and every time I go back to my roots rooted I feel increasingly more like an alien in my own home town There’s a point of no return despite returning  It
Okay look. I found this song on Spotify, not knowing who it was by. Found it on youtube. Did a dive into who it's by. I'm not a big fan of this vtuber thing (mostly because of their followings, it's usually less than... ideal people), but I think I'll set my morals aside just this once because this song is a bop
This is the smoothest song from you I've heard
Has she ever done this song on a Karaoke Stream？
Damn, I'm surprised how addicted I've been getting into your songs lately. XD
ラッパーの人達ってライブとかで何曲も歌詞覚えてんのすごいな
Love how the song progresses from talking about the topic in a cryptic, battlefield language but then by the second half, she drops the mystique and says her piece straight up, no fancy filters lmao
HIDDEN TALLENT 🔥🔥🔥🔥 KEEP IT HIDDEN 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This song hurts like a real cut. But is tough love needed to everyone who's planning to take this path. When I finally put my hands on PC this gonna be a long walk up the hill. Luckily I never planned to do it for riches or fame.
this is NOT it, we are not making it out tha hood!!
"start creating stop twitting"
Ts fye asl
Its so cool
This song if fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is the song I often fall back to when I'm losing confidence in my streaming. I don't know why but this song always encourages me to pick my sword back up and start swinging again. I don't think this is much of a callout song, but more of an encouragement for us who want to reach that mountaintop.
I don't want to sound like a jerk or anything I'm new to your channel but you kind of sound like demon dice =/
what.... this song is already 1yr old
hype's gone and it's still an absolute banger sasuGUH Mori-sensei!
pipkin Pippa had this in her top five.
Why’s this remindin me of Eminem
I'm preparing for college and listening to this helps so much with how nervous I am. this song is a fucckin blessing edit: I GOT INNNN THANK YOU MORI CALLIOPE edit 2: second year going strong I LOVE YOU CALLI
ow
🤙🏻💯💚 addicted to your music 🎶

Calli I'm finally starting this journey.
🔥🔥🔥
Hey gang, back when this song came out I was putting my nose to the grindstone and working 8 hour days to come home and work on animating and 3d modeling until midnight.  Now I've got a job in the industry that's far beyond my wildest dreams, thanks to the good Lord.  Thank you Calli, this song was part of the fuel that kept my fire burning. You and the girls have been a constant comfort and inspiration. Keep swinging. ❤️
i am not cha sensei but i ben sayin sense.   this bar live free inside my head, ffs.
I'm a sucker for alliterations like the ones at 0:25. Calli went OFF.
this song got me to make 1second animations every day unless i cant and maybey eventually make somthing higher quality later.
Wtf. I never expected your music to be so goooood. I can’t get enough. More goosebumps today than I’ve had in the last year….
bby i luveeee u
バカかっこいいわ、、、
AFTER THE LYRICS I HAVE TO SO GET PERMISSION TO COVER THIS OMG THIS SONG GOES HARD THE LYRICS ARE SO CLEVER OMG
This song has helped me to continue as a content creator. I've been creating MMD content for over 10 years and now streaming/Vtuber for just over a year. Still a small creator but Mori would be happy that I create content instead of just do a lot of talking on Twitter.
Welcome to the mountain top waiting till your balls fall
Castle Crashers type beat
Song name ?
Found this song from the comments on a Rev Says Desu video, and honestly, this just adds to the pile of motivation to create my Worlds, and share them for everyone to see. Now it brings up the question; just how much motivation do I need in order to get me to actually share it? I've got these whole worlds, fitting every description I hear from people for what they enjoy seeing in content, and even filling spots that I feel would completely change the market, but I just can't get myself to actually turn these worlds into a tangible experience for others to enjoy. I've got all the characters, all the plans, all the skills, all the resources, and all the motivation, as well as constantly getting the urge to do it, but I just. . . Can't do it. What am I missing? Support? I would say what I need is an audience to tell me to do it, and support from that audience, but I know that that only comes from work. Hard work, the very work that I need that support for. Maybe it's my refusal to cheat or self-promote. I have something driving me to do it, but it just isnt working. I have all the motivation in the world, hundreds and thousands of voices telling me indirectly that I have what they are searching for, but I just can't bring it into their reach. I feel like this might be going on for too long, but I felt the need to express this somewhere, and just get it off my chest. Hey, maybe sharing this will finally fulfill whatever I need to get the work done. But before I close off this comment, I would like to add; this is not me asking for an audience. This is not me asking you to support me. I want to earn it myself. But I just needed to get this out there, and maybe finally saying this will open the floodgates and allow me to bring my own worlds to life. If you are interested, then cool. If you _choose_ to go out of your way to go to my channel, cool. But I'd rather you just wait until I show up on your reccomended, where I can earn the audience legit. I'd rather you just, take this as motivation, I guess. Know that all it takes is to finally open the gates, and chances are, there will be an audience, and rather than spambotting youtube links, or trying to get clicks from Shock value(I swear if one of those spambots ends up on this comment, it's getting *all* the pure and utter loathsome hatred that I've been keeping inside), I intend to _earn_ that audience.  Here's a little _truly_ motivational quote for you;  You may not be able to succeed, you might never be discovered. But if you don't at least try, you make that might, go to nothing. Everything you can create has an audience out there. You just gotta find it. And if you don't create, you won't ever reach them. If you think you aren't creative; you're wrong. _everybody_ can create. We live in the world of innovation, and as long as you have a functioning brain, you can learn to create. Can't code? No problem, just follow a course or guide online. Can't draw? Well right there, you are just lying to yourself. Just *_try_* and if you aren't happy with that drawing, then fix what was wrong with it. If the drawing is fundamentally flawed at its core, then you didn't try. And no, simple stick-figures are not trying But if you can draw stick figures in different poses, that right there is enough, as then all you need is a story. Then you can share that story with the world through animation. Can't animate? Bullsh*t, you can move, and if you're reading this, you probably have a way to record yourself. Even if you have only one limb, you can still do it, it just takes more time. You csn Motion Capture yourself, and apply those animations to 3D models. And if you only have one limb, then you _definitely_ have a story to tell. If you had a rough life, you can take inspiration from that. If you're a stuck-up spoiled snob that's full of themself, all it would take is to get off your high horse and you can take an idea and run with it, 'cause that lifestyle means you've got money to spare, so you can do _anything_ with ease. But even if you're poor, you have _some_ kind of technology, for you to be reading this, and that is all you need. Computer? Get OBS and some free game off the internet and do let's plays, earn a living, and from there,  you can upgrade. And if you've already got worlds waiting to be released, all you need is to share those worlds, and chances are, you will succeed. Be better than me, and get out there, _share_ what you create.
It took me until today to realize this song is a sequel.
This beat is so hard. Is there a link to the instrumental?
whether you like the song or not you can't deny calli is hella skilled also the people who are mad don't get the song </3
Every time I listen to this song I'm reminded why we call her dad cuz Calli really is daddy materi- *COUGH* what? Oh! Nothing.... I said nothing
The 17 dislikes are the vtweeters who got offended note: Im using an attachment to see the dislikes
fire on mute
As of a few hours ago I've released my own original rap EP, and Calli's music as a whole, but this song in particular was the driving force behind it which motivated me whenever I felt like giving up. I don't think this song will ever age.
Cool 😎
This is one of the best songs shes ever made imo Even her own new stuff can't top this tough love energy
i'll be honest, when i first heard this song, i didn't like it as much but playing it in Beat Saber has given me a new appreciation for it and with the line "I hope you're ready to be swinging till the night falls" it really fits the game (Man i really need an official Hololive pack for Beat Saber now, so many good charts, Excuse My Rudeness, Reflect and Off With Their Heads being my favourites)
Suckerz!
Damn this beat is insane.
the art style reminds me of persona
Bro, I found a vtuber on youtube who reviews power tools. He's a big ol bear. If you getting lapped by that guy, Calli being successful wasn't your problem. lmao
it give me true chills
The mixing and mastering of this is fire too! very impactful and dynamic with a good voice level. Love it.
Didn't expect to be this good I never really heard of your music until a few months ago when someone mentioned then I saw camellia say something about it and checked it out good job :)
This song was stuck in my head all day!!
Is it just me or is she rapping fast?
2 million skeletons.
(whispers...) Hey, it's no longer one million.
I roll up to the Ramstein gate blasting this song. Keep it up, I love you work :)
Is eventually possible to include the song in a YT video?🧐 thanks for the info
Why is this inspiring in a twisted way?
this is demondice though aint it?
God, she AnimEminem
Eminem: You think you good "*talks while having goosebumps*"
A God casted up from below
I can't believe this is already a year ago, I remember when I got hyped the moment the premiere started omfg.
1 year later and this song still hurts v-twitters. Nice
Removing their heads isn't going to solve anything when they have evolved not to use their heads.
1 year since, got a job, getting a better job, working on streaming, applied to Nijisanji. Keeping swinging fellow deadbeats.
this song is so good! i've been playing it on loop all day it never gets old
Calli has been signed to Universal Music! Let’s goooo
10 mill views damnnnnn
Pop off queen
This song is awesome I wish it was on Spotify
I'm back here again because I need the brain fog beaten out of me so I can get more stuff done.
I love you... 😍😍😍😍😍
I subscribed :D
As if two million skeletons hit that "Subscribe" for satire!
If this ain't inspiring, then your aspirations are weak
after easily 1000 rewatches,  I just noticed the tattoos on her wrists. I'm fucking blind
How has it taken me more than a year to listen to Calli's music, this is so fuckin' good!
1:21
1 song is so good
Wow it's been a year. Congrats on 10M Calli!
2:58 background sound reminds me the old days playing Diablo. Aside that, what can I say, I follow you from the start of this and everyday I get more surprised about you, these banging lyrics and songs, nailing it with all your content, it really shows all the effort you have put all this time into it and I really appreciate that effort, not all the people are willing to climb to the montain top, is more comfy being in some place safe along the way and talk against the one that reached it or are higher than one but I can see the light of the people that have been polished through the hardships and reach high places, I'll support you like a lot of deadbeats until the end cause you've won it, you're worthy of all you have got even when the "impostor" syndrome attacks somedays lol
10m

So close to 10M
I listen to this whenever I think to myself "bah, my art sucks, I should just quit- if I require motivation to do it is it really my passion?" But then I listen to this and then I remember the practice to perfection "is a pain you learn to savour".
7M for Q, now OWTH is about to cross the next milestone.
約24000で1000万や！ (っ ॑꒳ ॑c)待機
I often come back to this song and it fills me with such badass energy and it still makes me react to the lyrics certain moments, absolutefuckingly incredible.
10M soon let's go
this song about to make me catch up on studying and assignments

Happy 1 year
*"calm down Jamal don't pull out the nines"* , is the only thing that I can say cause the haters are dying just hearing this fire
Hi from Ireland
Happy 1 year anniversary to the song that I love since I fall into the rabbit hole
does this ring any bells?
this isn't even a calliope
DD
This has been playing non-stop in my head for the past week now. Been streaming since 2013 and I've been through the mindset of giving up several times. Now it has been almost a year since Vtubing and I'm going all in with my big redebut next week. I will never give up, and I hope I can make you proud! Keep being awesome 💜
I love your songs so much!! You're also the reason I started watching V-Tubers, so thank you! 😊
damn thats fire
We’ve got a new crop of fools for Calli to reap. I know she isn’t likely to roast them in a song, but they fucking deserve it! Off with their heads!!
When's your graduation Ms. *NOT* Company Hire
>Stop tweeting and start creating. Should have followed that advice  El keko topo
>Dont call me a company hire >I will defend a friend who calls me and my colleagues company hires
日本語の訳付きなの助かる~😽 めちゃめちゃ良い声😻😻
For some reason i think of destiny with this song. - The mountaintop as in felwinter's peak. - "Untill the night falls"  In the lore, the crucible is to train new lights for the battle against the darkness. - Lastly, i imagine lady efrideet singing this whole thing.
Hey Mori, been hooked on this song for almost a year! Still so good! Could you please do an instrumental or something like that? Thanks. ❤️🔥
やばすぎ🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 vにもこんなモンスターがいたとは...
still a banger
Its a love letter wrapped in roses thorns.
Almost one year and this song is still straight up fire! And I'm glad to see that some aspects of her dress here was used in her kimono outfit especially the mask. ❤️
Lets go for 10M views
シンプルにかっこよすぎて惚れた
英語だからこの和な雰囲気がより良いよね
This song is exactly the push people need, I’ve found this motivating for me to *actually* get to work on not just trying to work on sticking up for myself more, but along with working on my own vtuber and streaming on twitch! I so far have done progress (even if only a little) each day I’ve had available to myself! Today I’m hoping to keep that up and make my logo ❤️ thank you calli fo being a big inspiration for me!
Спасибо, Калли, что делаешь для нас прекрасную музыку! Русские dead beats любят тебя!!!
Now calli's new kimono outfit finally released, make me want to come back to listen to this incredible song! 💀💀
I think Japanese style music and English rap is so cool.
This will reach 10M soon...
I can't believe this song is almost a year old already o_o
can't believe its nearly been a year since this song has been out
it kinda seems like drill somehow idk
I knew this would be her official design or faithful to it
Came back after Calli finally got her official kimono!
After one year, our wish hath come tru, comrade. Dad finally hath tis as new costume!
The more I hear Calli rap the more certain I am that she was demon dice.
I heard Kiara yelling KFP in the first few seconds, now I can't unhear it anymore
11 months passed, still consider it as my favorite Calli's song! Amazing!
Whoever made the captions I salute you
I should send this to my classmate. He always talks about the importance of "doing your best" and I as a lazy person say I don't care about doing your best as long as there's results. During our group project, he was literally doing the bare minimum, and I the lazier guy had to correct and fact check everything he did, because he half-assed all of it🤦‍♂️ especially with the amount of simple mistakes he made. That guy is literally a sayer and a shitty hypocritical half-asser.
Happy New Year from 2022!!! Were here, we did, we made it!!! 7 full moons and a waxing gibbous!!!!
Throwing my dumb hat into the ring. No turning back now.
this sucks
I think this is the best
This song's so fire it gave me third degree burns in the winter
mori: work hard twitter morons: autistic screeching
I come here often when I feel like I deserve to be crushed into tiny pieces for slacking off
THIS WAS 10 MONTHS??!??!?  I can still remember the moment I was wait for the song.
the best song to play while killing a boss
The picture/sound reminds me of two other songs. That’s not bad, it just reminds of them. I actually really liked the song. I will try to learn it.
11 months later and the community still needs this advice, even more now than when it dropped TBH.    When I'm getting in my own head, in that downward spiral, this song reminds me that the challenge is part of it and that I need to get back to work.
The character design is good
What a banger
love love
This song gives a person with drive energy to succeed.
MV見らずに聞き流しててAOさんを彷彿とさせるものがあったから見てみたらAOさんで笑った
Come here from fnf holofunk 🗿
Here from Lucy Pyre
how do you even write the lyrics?
Wow... Came back to my boy Double-D to find quite the story... This song really feels like the next chapter to saikoro of a generation. What an evolution.
Holy fuck this is fire!!!

Omg, i dig a rabbit hole really deep

2:14 I Love This Part!!!!!!!!
Absolutely stunning reminds me of DEMONDICE
Still my favorite calli song
"Expect no less than earth shaking when these Dead Beats rise..." Honestly that's the best part for me, knowing that Calli believes in us :')
Sounds strange without BF’s Or Mano Aloe’s Vocals Inbetween Every Verse
Calliope's next song title: "Burn the heretic"
Yes! Yes! Thank you!!!
짱이다
すげーかっこいい！！
このビデオは本当に9か月にもう配信したのか？変っすー～　近く感じています。
great tunes, reminds me of Karmin, rapper from the US. both great. keep it up mate!!
I love Kitsune‘s🔥🤷🏿‍♂️
this is really good. needs more views.
Thanks for giving me this punch in the face everytime I think about giving up, Calli
Love it❤️
Never stopped swinging my scythe since this came out.. Landed me job.
"Expect no less than Earth shaking, when these Dead Beats rise!"  - Calli  Your first concert.... Oh Hell Yeah!! 🤘🤘
デッドマーチ03後に来ました。脳味噌爆発❗️
imagine listening to this on repeat while doing online exam     i know i did...
i dont know what a mori calliope is but i think i like it?
아 칼리님 제 대가리 좀 가져가주세요 정말….
Now I want Calli to do a cover of Heads Will Roll.
I love the outfit this song has for her.
I like the way her hair is raised, really helps the spider lilies.
what does she mean by 'little miss company hire' ? great song otherwise
hoping for an EN New Year outfit.
this song gives me so much energy
Beans.
Love this song
I bop to this song everyday that i almost forgot why this song was created in the first place.
Its just like Halloween
The song was so fire it burnt an entire community
Lit 🔥🔥🔥
Thank you so much Calli for the amazing song!!  I began my firefighter training a few weeks ago, and it turns out that it's pretty intensive (who knew) this song really reminds me of the harshness of it, not the words of my trainers necessarily, but my own internal self-talk as I kind of force myself to do my absolute best.
I found a new muse, I suppose.
I always come back to this song to ground myself
Step on me
That slaps Calli, good job! <3
I wanna be just like one day calli! My soul is yours and i hope i can meet you one day!
"Welcome to the mountaintop... I hope you're ready to be swinging 'till the night falls."  I really love this part.
AO作曲あちいいいいいぃぃ
The Guy Who made the Subtitles is good
I always love to come back to this song every now and then, I love it
just how....why i havent heard earlier of you!? Q_Q fml.. all ican say is, pretty much nothing, cause im speachless/writeless/sentenceless fkn Brainless after that trip, Calli? LOVE! holy crapu
nice
bro this is mad trash
I always revisit this song when i need a boost in motivation even before becoming a vtuber but god that line of “pain you learn to savor” hits so much harder now after 5 months of not being happy with my mic setting and going from groaning for 30 minutes while working on settings to 3 hours of constant setting’s hell overtime XD.

I feel naruto coming from this
Slap those Twatters good!
This will never get old
It's been like 7 months since this came out and I think it's still the heaviest song Calli put out, absolute banger
I'm thinking about trap basketball like this
Куда второй лайк поставить?
who knew a simple beat and words mashed together could change you, huh.
This song reminds me of the JT machinama Minecraft rap song that introduces the mobs
🤍
"RIP and tear, make me believe it"?   iS tHaT a DOOM ReFeReNcE ?
oh that is *FIRE!!!!!!!!!*
so cool
DADDY STEP ON ME

Oh...MG. writing rylics for learning. welcome to the mountaintop waiting'till the flight calls I hope you're ready to be swingin'till the night falls Are you a slave? an entertainer 'till the fun dies? I hope you're ready to be swingin''till the sunrise! the flame that faintly wavers        steins the brain with flaver the kinda(これはkind of a)pain that you complain about, then learn to savor(yes!) A mistic walk beside the... SADISTIC SAKURA(これはもしかして 演出として動員する偽の客を意味するサクラ を意味してる？) kinda wished to talk with ya(you) Bore me, and it's off with your head!

FIRE 🔥
perfect singing
This song is super good... the message is even better. You have really inspired me to do better. Thanks Calli.
Tough Love ❤️
listening to this before i stream each time gives me such motivation, you are an inspiration! keep it up
Woo we imposter IO this wit my cousi!!!!!

I LOVE THIS SONG SOO MUUCH CALLI!! SOO DAMN FUUN!! POOG catJAM :DD

今まで気にしなかったけどmixAOさんかよ……
Nice rap!
Daym!! That was fire  wait... 🔥  What the...🔥🔥🔥 Oh no it's spreading!🔥🔥🔥🔥  IT'S SPREADING!?!?? 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥
It took me 8 months, but as of today I published a book and this song was what pushed me into making the leap.
still hypes me up.
和風レゲエっぽくて好き
Omg I love this time to take heads and ur still queen
I really wish she will release a few more songs in this style (the new ones are also good but mixing would be better)
yes im a slave what about it?
🖤🖤
God, those lines are ferocious.
sheeeeeeeit this amazing O_o

I only just realized this song was roasting them "fake" v-tubers lmao
"Start creating, stop tweeting"  I felt the delicious salt in dat one

中毒性はんぱねえな…

This goes hard! And that Japanese vibe, mmh. Good stuff.
I Like song 3452
Anne Boleyn has been really quiet since this song dropped ngl
This is still the best song from Calli❤️.
bro just take my money
Came back after seeing what fucking Fox girl Luna Vtuber posted, that self-defeatist, pessimistic mentality is going to kill her faster than Mori can burn her, luck only favors who she sees fits and not often you get her eyes on you but success gives the opportunity to everyone.
How weird... It doesn't sound nearly as good as before.
This isnt the calliope i wanted i want with funny clown
I'm hope she doesn't take my head away
These lyrics are so good, so catchy! I've listened so many times
mom，我恋爱了
Yes, let's show the world, "Grab the scythe and show them how"!
This song radiates power and fire!
if u see it a different perspective, this song is about drifting in the touge at night and defeating the other racers. just the way i think.
Stfu fnf fans i want to listen this thing
Here again because of irys issue
好聽🥰
I'm back
Start creating stop tweeting👏 THIS
Think I'll make this my motivational music from now on
Damn🥵🥵🥵
Throat sliting song man . my hamster is turning into godzilla
Hey, about that little group of lines about people saying Hololive is the only reason you popular. You probably did work your ass off, but let's be honest, you definitely have times and times more exposure than indie vtubers BECAUSE of the Hololive name.
I will be not surprised if I already watched this a thousand times I played this so much I can't count it anymore
eeevery song dead beats. i dont get it. is it some kind of signature?
calli's music is the type that the edgy emo kid with dyed hair would be listening to in school on their headphones
Damnnnnnnnnn I’m yours my queen
Those Lines has meaning mannn  This is song is a banger
why can't you rap over a real beat for once
Bro this beat tho!!!
Listening to this was nice to help bolster myself after a disappointing writing contest loss I just had.  Thanks, Calli. ^^
No offense to Calli, but if this is how she thinks life works then no wonder she's overworking herself into a sleep deprived insanity.
thats a lot of fancy effects
Female rapper is mostly sexual so this is so refreshing
Best motivation song
My head would be happy with you.
not Korean....
Why does this chick have rap songs better than 95% of all modern rappers
lmao those random brostep wubs in the back
Yo... anyone else feeling like this song would work if it was by Schaffer the Dark Lord?
I'm still waiting for her to sing this live, it will be a bop...
wow!!!
날 가져요 엉엉
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Before i didnt really understood the lyrics and just vibed to the beat, but now i find myself even more in heat for this song after fiding out what it meant at the time it was made, damn Cali roasted some lazy buns HARD!
666万！
imagine Calli making an original song that has a few fast verses same like Eminem?  that would be fucking siick
FHJFRUEU i’m obsessed
This is my most watched video ever
Amazing
2:32 to 2:40 is some Eminem level energy and I am here for it!
i personally don't like rap but this is pretty bangin'
I had been going out with this girl for about 3 weeks when I found out through a friend that she was actually married. She was my first girlfriend so it was tough, but then I remembered a certain lyric from this song. "Are you a slave, an entertainer till the fun dies?" I decided that I wasn't going to be used and broke up with her.  Calli, thank you for giving me the strength to make one of the best decisions of my life.  Can't wait for your next song
niCE
I had a heart attack when I realized she’s either demondice or she was at least hired by them
Looooooove this
all her songs are bangers. I don’t care what anyone else says.
Vtuber boom-bap? More, please.
Fnaf
●▅▇█▇▆▅▄▇
calli should totally have her 3d model wearing this outfit!!! looks so cool
KgkzganmbYAS MIN
This person shoots you and it fixes your shoulder
Yooo calli someone named revel ch made a response to this. I think you’ll like it
Clean wordplay. This whole song hits
so here you are demondice
never realized how fire this is til' i lost my head
listening this in my IEM bass head
Huh- She kinda sounds like Demondice- Am I the only one hearing that?
I always come back here daily. Not just because this song absolutely slaps, but because it’s incredibly inspiring. Some bars moved me to tears and when desire to dream and act upon it wavers and fails due to circumstances day by day in life, this track is just the motivational tough love sucker punch I need to not loose sight of my passion.   Thank you, so much Calli. You have a Dead Beat for life in me. :)
눈나. 나 죽어 sister. i die.
THIS SONG IS A BOP
오리고기 그는 신이야
1.2k people related too hard...
I fear the day she writes a diss track
The Mask looks a bit like the one Akagi had in the Azur Lane Anime
BEP BEP BAP BOOP BEP BAP BAP👋
When i searched this song i got the dance till you're dead original
I wonder who did the captions like that?? It made the whole song really accessible and easier to follow along, I wanna know how it's possible to do that on YouTube! :0c
Hmm am I crazy or dose she sound and sing like demon dice?
a
pretty nice earworm
SO COOL
meow meow
Why you gotta burn us with fire like this? Awesome banger
I made my dog hear this song He started to rap along
。W。
I think this song is so cool!!! Is the coolest song that I’ve ever listened,and I think this song must be a hit!!!!!!!!! I can’t think any other words to say about this song. It is soooooooo amazing!!!!!
3:09
I LOVE YOU CALLI
かっけえ…………てぇてぇ……⸜(  ॑꒳ ॑  )⸝
I've always wondered what is that style/type of masked called that cali is holding
🔥 FIRE SONG, FIRE RHYMES, FIRE , JUST FIRE
Damn. I found a new song I can bump on repeat...
Best song I've heard, including Live Again
I have the feeling youtube liked this song
救命超好聽的啦
the song still good these day
칼리님노래너무좋다
I need Mori Calliope x Demon Slayer merch like, right fuckin now
this is sick and I don't even listen to rap
YOOO THIS SLAPS
the song is fire, you can have my head, here.
i love this

Хммм, по-моему звучит шикарно 👍
I'm starting my CA from this week. Pass % is only 1%. 5 years of no social life, no entertainment, little free time and only studying and work. I'll be creating my own path to this mountaintop. I know you may not even see this comment. Ever. But still, i wanna say, i'll surely reach the top. Blood, sweat, tears- whatever it takes.
Ngl, I didnt like this kind of style hearing it the first time, but it grew on me so much that it actually slaps.
I would kill for a cover of Other Friends from Steven Universe.
does anyone appreciate the sound design?
Nice👌
Cali low-key getting us deadbeats to try at life with lyrics like this
I love it music *go-na raping*
cool
Put it on, and did all the work 30% faster
멋있다
Vocals compliment the beat very well, the glitch hop fits really well
really good
Each time I listen to this song I love it more. What an amazing artwork.
The lyrics kinda remind me of Dancing Samurai feat. gakupo
The YouTube algorithm led me here. I love this song. It was the best song ever!
It’s nice the subtitles actually go with the song like a karaoke would
我是你的粉丝love
Damn. I know how you're feeling. It's like these fuckers in society are so entitled that they think fame and fortune should be handed to them for existing... like spoiled little stains they are.
"what is up humans"
しゅき♡
0:51 bro the beat goes hardddd
🔥🔥🔥
I dont know why but this song kind of reminded me of some fnaf song
日本語を置いていくぜ！！！！！最高ーーーーーー
So you have a scythe? Many a problem here. One, I am laughing in firearms Two, I am laughing in Fiore's Flower of Battle Three, I am laughing in Meyer's Art of Combat Four, I am laughing in Templar army Five, I am too alone for happiness.        This is a joke

"Learn to Savor." What most muricans need to do now.

既出かもだけど、骨しかないガイコツに“皮肉”って最高のパンチライン過ぎん?
Like Russian I say this song absolut YES.
I don't even like rap genre but this is going to my favs.
나는 이사람이 일본인인지 미국인인지 모르겠다
essentially if you feel called out this little number goes out to you, consider this your kick in the ass to put in the effort.
Gives me the vibe of some kinda dungeon in a persona game
“Naughty boys and girls get chopped” Me, who is not a boy or a girl: Can I sing with you then dad?
what happens when you make her voice low pitch or high pitch lowkey wanna try it out lol
"No ambition. Try again next week." HER VOICE IN THIS LINE IS SO FREAKING SEXY OMG!! fight me kung hindi!
*Dance Dance Till Your Dead*
Have you watched Gintima? This makes me think of it.
please cover the queen song
She is just showing them wannabes what they deserve sending them straight to Alkatraz
Calli: Off with their heads Some random guy called Maximilian Robespierre: Cool, maybe we can make a revolution out of this
Dude I put this song in my loud speaker to blow away my neighbour songs
Calli is seriously has a great voice. I like her style.
"You can't be strong if you give up from just a miss in ya streak" This is what Duolingo Owl would've wanted to say to my face, but his company forbids him to hurt his students that way
*Gawr Gura Vibing..*
As someone who used to make content like 8-9 years ago and has just sat on their ass since then I am trying to take this to heart and it's a painful experience lemme tell ya. Not a bad pain. It's a pain of agreement and regret. Existential crisis is a word.
Thank you so much ☺️
This and the Marine songs kinda lit.
My ears are blessed
번역버전은없나요 헬프미
Imagine this on beatsaber..
I love this. It kind of reminds me of some Hollywood Undead songs.
I can't speak English, so please excuse me through an interpreter. Your rap is very nice. I really liked the "Japanese style music video" this time. I'm sorry if it's English that doesn't make sense.
Look like a demon from the da demon slayer
Woah I loved that a lot ur good keep it up :)
still just kicks in soo hard. <3
OH MY GODDDDDDD!!!!!!!!! I'll pay the rent. U're my rap queen
How are the captions turni g red
less than 0.5% dislikes. Yakes.
Why didn't I listen to this before?! THIS IS GREAT :D
So cute!!!!!!!!
you already live in my head rent free :,)))
Calli you really help inspire me to be a stronger and more competent person. Thank you :) It may not seem like much but this song helped inspire me to take a 9 hour shift at work instead of my usual 5 hour.
She living in my head aren't free ahhhhh XD honestly the lyrics are genius
this song is still a banger
GRIM SHADY!!!!
Where can I buy a copy of this song?!?! Amazing track!
Well ladies and gents we finally got a good female rapper, and it was a Vtubing death goddess, that did it. Seriously though this song absolutely slaps
Was blasting this in my car with a couple 10" subs and fuuuuuck this bumps so hard
Oh this is a good song
Muse DashってグラがやっていたGameでカリの曲すごくPlayしたいなと思った。Ｃｏｏｌカリ👍 ＰｏＰな死神ってCooLなデザインで大好きだよ。
Can we get a rhyme scheme for this like how Genius does with their songs? Because these are definitely Calli's hardest bars since her debut.
OMG ❤️
Coool
She wanted the vtweeters to just start creating content cuz she wants them to succeed and they ignored her tips and this is the consequence you get
彼岸花みたい。
The feeling when a rap literally slays you...
“cause with devotion to the mission straight devour the weak, and ocean full of competition get your actions to speak” ngl, she spitting
i love this song HAAA❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
日本人いる？
im conflicted I like her music but never responded well to tough love, so I try not to think about the lyrics much. I would say it takes hard work to be an entertainer but a massive portion of fame on youtube is luck
this song give me bug vibe of Kikuo 🥺
A grim reaper out here spitting fire. I LIKE IT!!
Vtuberの前の方しか歌しらんくてこっち聞いたけどやっぱり上手いやないか
can she chop me real quick?
Nope, definitely Demondice's voice. Songs are great, but electro swing ones are better and I probably won't subscribe, since I'm not a Vtuber lover or something...
かっこいい
If any of my favorite en vtuber does this lol I'ma send this vod
found this through beat saber hahah
“Astronaut in the ocean”
if eminem was both a girl and a vtuber, we get calli.
This is going on my Workout playlist and I don't care who hears it.
iloveuuuuu calliiii
-Sadistic Sakura!- This was so good!
that awkward moment when you have to put [ORIGINAL SONG] on the actual original songs title just so you don't get ratio'd on a copy and paste of your own song...  for real though I'm confused with how some of callis songs get better as you listen to them, like the first time i heard this song it just sounded weird and every rewatch it just got 5 times better until the 5th rewatch and it was suddenly one of the best songs I've ever heard.
This song is really fucking good. Talented confirm.
I was like DAEM! What an intro
Love this
bop
Y’all some nerds in these comments bro
New fan here. Just discovered you all last night. I have to say....I am now a huge fan. Keep it up Reaper. I can't wait to see more. -Enigma-
If people are offended by this wait till they listen to her um....other raps
So I rap and these are some bars and she has a lot of skill I can't wait for what happens next one thing I really what to see is her in a diss track battle
so I found out today that youtube-kun is too good at recognizing voices and similar songs  so ahm two holomyth members found
A collab with [ Redacted ] in future?
Epic
nice, an absolute bop.
My favorite!
I came looking for madness combat music and found a somewhat good song
Finally. I hear a lot of people this gets them motivated while running. Personally, I just like to hear my thoughts while I run (but 4 years of Cross Country and Track will do that to you). But I did find what it is helping me with.  I am a month behind on my math class due to work. I have to do about 10 lessons a day to take the final test on the final day. Been having trouble with focusing. It took me over an hour to do one seven minute lesson because I just wasn't understanding it. I blasted this song during the practice problems and it got me on track.  ...  This is when each week needs to be finished by.  Need to finish week six before/on May 7th (today), week 7 on May 9th, WK8 on May 13th, WK 9 on May 22, WK10 on May 27, WK11 on June 1st or 4th, WK12 on June 6th, WK13 on June 14th, WK14 on June 18th, WK15 on June 19th and complete the final test of WK16 on June 20th.  (Trig is not hard. But graphs are my weakness when it comes to math and trig is nothing but graphs.)
People think she got it easy as she's working for a Entertainment company, yeah you get fame and funding, for a price.
Wow the captions are so cool
she is like an intimadating queen here
hope this outfit will be the new outfit before she collab with senpais before New Year next time
FIRE🔥
Alternative title Corona rap
Eh I wasn't all that fond of my head anyway

"I'm not your Sensei but I've been sayin' sense"  Cali, you absolute lyrical genius
Why can i STOP STARING AAAAAAHHHHHHH. 🥵
This is stuck in my head
so basically "that people' who look down on calli is just because she's being based
0:02
shes killing them.
When I feel like giving up or taking a useless break I listen to this because I see my own faults in the lyrics, and they're definitely not something I'm proud of. I'm trying to fix them and replace them with habits I can be proud of though!
I didn't like this when it premiered but it really grew on me.   Excellent work, Calli-chan.
AMAZING SONG!!!!
hah suckers
wow.. this is quite genius
Läuft bei dir
this is actually a super in-touch autopsy of the independent vtuber scene, mori cares about you and your talent, you just need to show it off more
Now i saw more of the VTuber land scape i think making 3D avatars would be a better job than trying to compete with the ppl who use them. Examples given in this song as some of the best too.
"Success isn't earned, it's leased. And rent is due every day."
recommend again
I've really only just noticed that Mori's hair in the illustration is drawn in the style that the Lycoris Radiata or Red spider lily plant looks like.  The plant symbolises death in asian countries. i really like that detail
My fav part 0:50 - 1:14 🔥🔥🔥
Hit or miss, I guess they never miss huh, I love this song
I'm creating and I don't have twitter! XD
Very cool song and singing.  You can certainly do song styles that I can't do well.  I am a singer myself.  Am enjoying checking out your song list.
これが死神太夫ですか。
The Twitter hate is getting more intense, which reminded me of this song and came back for a listen. This is honest exactly how an idol should be, giving inspiration to us all to keep pushing forward. Thank you for your hard work, we love you <3
Yo that's 🔥 I wasn't expecting it like that lol
Are you the one who sang this!?this is phsycotic!
This slaps harder than nyanners slaps ironmouse
oh no she's cool guess i gotta simp now
I like the Kitsune mask.   OTFGK...
やっぱり歌めちゃめちゃ上手いですね！かっこいいですー
Damn...  I´m scared
i like how the special effects got more intense when she started dissing twitter crybabies
*Alice in wonderland*
Ребят, ни у кого нормального текста её песен нет? А то с субтитров тяжело лирику читать.

F ing amazing.

Dang this is good
call me crazy but she sounds exactly like demondice
貴方はカッコよすぎる。 信じられない。 私は初めてこのカテゴリーの曲を聞きました。 このカテゴリーはこんなにもクールなのを知りました。
I didn't get the chance to hear this song yet until I heard "vtubers" getting angry over this song. Anyways, now that I listen to it, this song is very bopping though. The art and video is beautiful too.  [commentary over this "controversy"] The lyrics are very tame, though? There's more "offensive" songs compared to this that talks down more degenerative towards a general populace? Guess difference is the lyric is available to read or it's just the people who already had problem with her beforehand just looking for excuses to get angry.
that goes hard that
are you demondice?!
このチャンネルの歌すごくいい
I love how I have watched this so much that youtube puts it in my top 10 recommendations nearly ever time.
Your boy wants y'all here to succeed, but you ain't gonna if you seek speed, the throne is stained with blood and sweat, the road is long, never forget, the struggle to climb and muscle burn, is the only way you'll ever earn, the glory of that for which you yern.  Now go do something...
This is a work of art
keep up the good work !
It cool
*me a starting vtuber that has multiple excuses* ,,,,, ILL TRY NOT TO BURN MY PC OKAY ILL DO IT I SWEAR IM SORRY MADAM
this music is fire
my mom: What are you hearing me:
???? How did you get the captions to turn red?
LOL
This inspired me to make content. Thanks dad :)
A
Just decided to listen bro, this is some fuckin  H E A T
sometimes @2:20 made me think that a door suddenly opens at 2 in the morning
This showing up to me because I was listening to some Demondice songs: "hol' up this is where they went?"
4.4Million Fit for a reaper-rapper!
wow.. love this song 😍😍😍
I wish I had someone like this in my life. Someone to force me to fight, to grow. I have a head full of dreams, yet I waste my time more and more, barely getting by. I don't doubt its the same for everyone. And since my dreams are the closest to impossible, I'll need to put in momentous effort to even have a chance. Still, even without someone to drive me, I'll still try. Or am I just sayin that.
so it's already almost 2months. where the heck those "Vtubers" on Twitter right now?
I love how her hair looks like a Japanese Spider Lily (a flower that has a relation to death in hanakotoba).
Who tf disliked this?!
heh RIP and tear
I hope Calli gets a kimono model, with her scythe transformed into a katana, that'd be dope.
AOのトラックに釣られてカリオペちゃんハマったのでニコニコしながら聴いてる
This is legit my war song ❤
I feel bad for the people who don't have their heads on right and dislike.

“Off with their heads” Uh Calli? Is Henry influencing you in the underworld?
oh?

Why my sub is red
This anime girl is legit more gangsta than most grown men I know.
Been headbanging through this song on repeat. Basically Blackpink's style in that it is rude but just objectively better and more savage
It took me at least 5 years to figure out that fourzer0 mean four zero not fourzer zero, im a dumbass
She really shut her haters on twitter down 😭😭🔥🔥
the dislikes are Vtweeters, and people who prefer a different genre of music maybe
Hey calli. Thank you for making this song it really helps me get through this tough time. Im having a hard time in school but i cant be strong if i give up from just a miss in my streak
hey this is not madness combat >:c
I’m just gonna say it’s a  fucking masterpiece AAAAAAAAAAAA
もうCD出してよ！！！！！おたくくんは耐えられないよ！！！！！！あー！！！！！！！！！！
rip and tear I'm satisfied
Happy birthday calli
Mori Calli girl, you're what the world needed but did not deserve <3.
The tamamo vibes though
Ok is nobody talking about the captions being seemingly custom?
someone tell me why this was insanely hot
Social media is probably the single biggest timesink right now. It's easier to tweet than create. It's easier to tweet than work on your craft  If you lack the discipline to get off Twitter enough to create some content, you need to shut the Twitter and other social medias down until you get creating.
damn she got drip
2:58 when that hits i always think they call me on discord
calli is the only woman i'd simp over, i don't watch vtubers often at all but when ever i check in calli is always being, how the cool kids say, 'pog champ'
I like that this music is something I can show to anyone and it's gonna like it, cause it's really good, nice work
Amazing
The first vtuber I encountered was gura but she really didn't have the type of entertainment I liked I don't regret choosing calli to watch more
My head is completely at your disposal, my queen
My head is yours
so cool XD
damn this kinda heavy :eyes:
Calli just slap there face and remember how pathetic they are.
_What if you climb to the top _*_but the summit is-_* *OH FUCK ITS CALI WITH AN AX!*
Hehe, that felt good
I've honestly lost count of how many times I've watched this since Feb. It honestly feels like Calli's magnum opus. But if the last few months have taught us anything, it's that she's gonna crank out yet another masterpiece before we know it.
The art so nice
She is like a secret chunni, while her steam personality is a total pushover..... though that is relatively typical in VR Tubers to be cute.
4
Its my type music thanks🙏
百鬼祭思い出した
The lyrics are so lit my previous phone bursts in flames
*"People desire truth, but even when they have it, they refused to look"* - Ahmet  Calli just telling them the truth, they asked for advice, she gave one, and yet they stay ignorant or arrogant
The slayer would be most proud mori...  Very proud.....
tbh this is the only rap song that I willingly hear from the start to the end, this song is just that fucking good
I'm here just because her rap is so lit  🔥🔥🔥
I want to see an animation where several worriars gather for the tournament on the top of the mountain when calli begin to sing it cash like a spell on all of them that makes them fight to the death. for some reason, this is what I depict when I hear this song.
最近カリオペさんのラップ知ってから 毎日聴いてるけど朝からテンションブチ上がります！
I'm making this my ring tone.
reminds me of hollywood undead
bro this song fire it kept me awake all night while making a project
MEW!!! 0:38
Whats going on? Context pls
Not bad
Vtweeter : *exist* Calli : Finally the lyric is complete
She said it’s time to rip and tear with the boys
oh my, so cool : > that give me chills. I like a song like this
Congratulations on 4M views
4 million views!
This is pure fuel.  Ive been working so hard since i heard this song to make my first song
I can't stop listening to this.
I love the lyrics
This bops
Yoo pump up
Im getting some JT music vibes, anyone else?
No matter how many times I listen to this, it's always as good as when I listened to it for the first time! Calli is amazing!
4M views calli!!!
Congratulations on 4 million!!!!!!!!!!!
Marry meeeeee plsssss
the voice is very similar to demondices huh
to be someone takes allot of work and effort.
This song makes me want to play Banner Lord for days on end.
Calliope is the girl eminem
Literally the Eminem of the V-tuber world and rightfully so. She be spitting straight facts and calling people out through her lyrics. This,i like
Dear Calli, I just started a week ago on this Vtubing thing, thank you for this beautiful song! It helps me feel motivated to really think about the stuff I want to make. I've been enjoying the art you RT on Twitter as well. It's inspiring and now it's like there's a fire lit up on a scythe that's chasing me from behind lmao. See you at the top once I get there! 🦉🖤
For me this is best song of her
4M 🎉🎉🎉
Theoretically this can apply to any goal.
im sorry for beathing ur air
Calli is really reaping the heads of many people with her **rapping! Hope she gets more recognition moving forward! Thanks for all your hard work Reaper-sama!
I was going to leave a comment to sumarize what I like this song and... Things just started rhyming...  Here it goes. "If you want to jump in this then come on!   You got to be prepared because the battles on.   If youre trying to be big Ill tell you exactly what you need to do.   And when its time to throw down, I will crush you!   Whatcha waiting for?  Theres work to do so quit nappin!   And if all youre gonna do is talk it aint gonna happen.   Ive done the work and made it to the top and nothing can stop me.   Youll have to work yourself down to the bone to stand a chance when you fight me!
This is so hardcore!  Im inspired and scared at the same time! XD
She's like a demon.....        "Ting"
Call the ambulance... .  .  .  .  .  .  but not for me! (*for the lazy ass cocky vtubers)

this is my first rap song in my spotify playlist
i wanna listen to this while dying , this is so good that i want it to be the last song  i listen to
Everybody gansta until the anime woman starts rapping...
Wait the replies here omg what drama
HEY DAVIE504 Slap thisss
only can say,like you and love you.
Respect the grind
sorry guys I can't see in the same way after the fart audio leak :(((
It do be like that sometimes death sensei. "no ambition try again next week"
this is actualy so good
increase this song tune to +2,5 , and you will hear Gura
Take my head please
Omg I love your song so much loll
Your demon dice right? You don't have to answer
(No dead people were killed in the making of this video)
Mori, I love your music. People say it's mean spirited and a lot are offended with your blunt words, but I love how raw it is. It gives me strength. Thank you ❤
Isn’t that dubstep?
So this is the reaper I've been hearing about. Lovely :)
Nice.
Female Eminem ❤️ Dont mess with the wrong person, haters.
Calliope when you kill me play this song
I know i'm late, but still. Love it,
where do i find the pic with calli with wink?
I first got interested by GawrGura then now im amazed by Calliope this song is incredible i might fall into the rabbit hole of vtube
oop i saw the thumbs down on this was 999
Favorite song atm 202q
She do be spittin fax though.
'Easy for you to say Miss company hire, as if this moves did not take heartache and these tracks are not fire' damn she spitting
How is it that Off With Their Heads and RIP can be in such different styles, yet both slap
WAIT WHAT, THE CAPTION IS MOVING WOAAAAAAH
i like  it and im only 30 seconds in
e
I'm furious I was completely indifferent to Vtubers until I was recommended clips of Calliope Mori for God knows what reason. Out of curiosity alone I visit her channel and see she makes music, the song on the forefront being titled "Off With Their Heads," so of _course_ I'm going to listen to it, because you don't reference the French Revolution and _not_ get my attention. And guess what Take a guess By the time she says "Welcome to the mountaintop" the second time, I've already liked and subscribed, read the description of the entire EN chapter, and learned what a bottom-left is. I hate it here This song is great I hate it here
0:29 Repentence?! Cali is an Isaac fan, CONFIRMED!!
that 7.1 effect was kinda cool
かっこええなぁ＊ これって誰達に向けての歌⁇
Watching this at nearly 4 million views and there's not even 1k dislikes yet feels like a genuine testament to how thoroughly solid this track is, goddang 🙏
Wtf did I just hear🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is it just me or does she remind you of demondice. I mean the style reminds me a lot of the rapping demondice did I wonder where she went
Damn, a real heavy but important message.
Ok all the loop edits making me like “IS THIS GONNA BE THE NEXT SEQUAL TO ANIME DOCTOR WHO, LIKE, MY TWO FAVORITE THINGS”
Her songtext is fire. ..but I can't watch it..(epileptic <~)
should i put out the fire on the corner of my room or let it burn
If you think she didnt deserve where she it's and all luck. Id be willing to roll the dice and bet you're some Karen who'd have a devil of a time getting out of wet papper bag. Ive been followed this rhyme master for a few months before she debuted, everything shes got she earned. Her words in this rap are gasoline, use it as fuel to push yourself to reach that proverbial mountain top or become consumed by the flames of jealousy and rage. The choice is yours.
Top. Girl voice top, music style top
I love how this is applicable to any kind of struggle for mastery of an art
Me: I don’t listen to rap Calli: *exists* Also Me: I don’t listen to most rap
I had no clue the best female rapper was a VTuber
King Henry VIII's wife: *doesn't make a healthy child* King Henry VIII:
I've been listening more closely to the background, and there's all sorts of sounds hidden in with all the noise. There's some obvious ones like a cat's meow 0:38, but there's also a quieter metal clash at 0:29, a baby at 0:33 dog bark at 2:07, some weird quack at 2:28, some guitar rumble at 2:50
The rhymes are so sick!!! Reminds me of hamilton's rhymes! (thats a compliment xD)
カッケェ！！
Love corazón mmd hola pirma animé nightcore
はぁああ…カッコイイ…！
Marry me Calli I die because of your cuteness 🥺🥺🥺💞😩😍😍
This is directed to vtubers but damn it hit me too. Time to do something. Also i should have posted this comment when the song released, but whatever
他曲も含めてTINY PRANETSの2人がこんなイカしたトラック作ってくれてるのが凄く嬉しい
This really reminds me of Demon slayer
Wait who is she dissing? What drama? Is she calling out someone specifically, or like a group of people in general?
*"In an ocean full of competition get your actions to speak"* Mori throwing so much shade😷😷😷
love it
Words truth, voice intoxicating, beat amazing, and rhymes professionally sick!
Hey go figure. A reaper that buries careers.
This song is fucking fire. I'm addicted.
かっけぇ… 日本勢いるかな…？
O-oooooooooo AAAAE-A-A-I-A-U- JO-oooooooooooo AAE-O-A-A-U-U-A- E-eee-ee-eee AAAAE-A-E-I-E-A- JO-ooo-oo-oo-oo EEEEO-A-AAA-AAAA
I know you play with your friends
I like you videos
if you slow down the video at around 0:02 or 0:03 i think kiaras saying “KFP” but im not sure
ok i didnt think she was any good but here i am.
Yeah she’s demondice
Лол, не знаю как мне порекомендовал ютуб это после eskimo callboy, но мне понравилось. Хай пипл, много тут ру?
OwO Daamn, the big energy just kept on coming until I came.... headless.
How do I listen to this ,doom 2016 ,and joji?
Cant wait for the EN 3D model reveal
"Welcome to the melontop"
Somebody get a a bucket of water This spng is on fire! 🔥
this music genre is metalstep?

This should be my intro to my channel
This gave me Rabbit Run by Eminem feels.
Yup still good
Great song, why the hell did you sound a hella lot like dice demon.
Fuck, Never thought i could fall in love with a song
This is low-key wholesome lol
😭😭😭😭😭
Damn this hits hard.
That’s a good song you made! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Firey!!!
1:39 is it just me or I'm hearing Cr1tikal vibe here...?
easy for you to say, you. little miss company hire. as if this moves did not take heartache and this tracks are not fire!
what
ah I'm in love, saying your music is great is a massive understatement  love it and why am I only seeing this now
Yes, I'm back here because that dad baits Twitter thread.
0:53 is my favorite verse, personally!
Really good music im liking it very much go on forever love from deutschland
There's fire everywhere calli committed arson
Damn she really got the skills of a singuer... I might be more fan of Gura its crazy... Fast yet even my french not really good at english can kinda process what she says, good pronunciation x')
和風ビートがとても良き
最近adoとカリオペ勘違いしてたわｗ カリオペは玉温泉ライブに行く途中に色々やらかしたやつだｗ
Nice
次は自分たちが海外ニキになる番か…
whoa I love it xD Subscribed! This diss track is a masterpiece xD Fighting!
OMG Perfect
sheesh
Is this song on spotify or Songflip????
絵を描いたり、作品を作る、励みになった。背中を押してくれるようなそんな曲に私は感じた。個人的にこの曲と歌詞、歌声好きだ😊
"I want to be like you someday!" "I work a lot and try all I can until I find success." "Yeah, exactly, success, that's what I mean."
I wish I had fallen into the rabbit hole during 2020 instead of 2021. I'm glad I was able to be so interested in hololive and vtubers. Bcuz there ain't turning back now.
bruh.... im speechless i cant believe it i think im falling into the hololive hole
Lol I'm playin' bop-it rn.
Why the Captions have Colors
Cool song mori
First time hearing this, subarashi!!! hands down, its taking my soul to hell :)
not gonna lie but the subtitles are really well created/designed
Calli is the type of girl to punch your nose flat, then proceeds to kissing it till it heals
pog
God of death pays rent
Yo, this feels like old school rap, the good rap back then, venting out truth and experiences through the songs with no censorship.  Man, our shinigami Mori Calliope is so fking talented.
ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!
This song is stuck in my head for weeks now, help
Add some cat ears and you get spirit blossom ahri
Can i just say, that many Vtubers have the same viewers, and I dont hate to say this but most Vtubers have a more or less the same kinda flow of things. Chatting and gaming. But I find Calli on the other hand quite entertaining and fun to watch. So i'd say that those randoms should stop clout chasing and just bow to the queen  "Gura ofc"
Her voice.  This is what does it for me.  Her singing sealed the deal of I need to catch her streams sometime.  Okayu and Korone will have to wait, Calliope has some wicked stylish confidence in her attitude towards competition and I'm loving it.
This song actually kinda says something about how the youtube algorithm right now is basically "survival of the fittest", and callie is basically challenging everyone to step it up. Also, even though the song is portrayed in Callie's usual cocky style, I don't think anyone really *wants* to see a channel they like bite the dust like that, hence why this song is being made at all.
calli's songs are basically the ones that made me wanna do rap. . . thanks calli
God, I can't get enough of this, absolute FIRE
I played this and my bop alert alarm went off
this is nutssss
omggggggg i all wase watch your vidoe your my fav omgggg
Yo this song slaps
Wow just wow
Is it me or did she just insult "RIP AND TEAR!"?
How the hell are the captions red like that
すき！！！！！
⛩ Nice ⛩
This song.. Obviously it’s directed towards vtubing and stuff but a lot of the message can be directed towards other stuff that has competition.  “When it gets down to the wire, just who survives? Are they the liars who sell their souls or those who dedicate their lives?” Deep.
Lmaoo the lyrics i love it
3.5M already... let's goo
this very good i think
Is there an instrumental version?
2:03 YES QUEEN
Good effing music
fire song keep up the work xd
Who's excited for the upcoming EP?
i came here with 0 expectations and i was god damn wrong
You're music is all so beautiful and lovely I love you calli don't let anyone discourage you beautiful ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I believe in Calli's Diss track supremacy...
Just a simple advice and then some toxic people take it on the wrong way SMH.
AAAA LOVE THIS LOTS, THIS IS DOPE LE QUEEN ❤ PLUS IT INCLUDES FACTS IT HITS DEEEEPPPPPPPP 😭👈🏻❤
💀🤟
So good
i dis japanese? 森 カリオペ i dunno wat is dis but its NANIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
theres a lot more effort that goes into popular Vtuber content than you realize. Im not sure if anyone remembers the fall of danplan in this comment section but Stephan made me realize something when it was happening: keeping up a persona for other people's entertainment demands effort and work. As you know everyone in hololive to some extent has their own personas, and they're making music too which requires immense amounts of effort and also creative passion. Calliope isn't saying you should give up because you'll never make it she's saying you need to bring some of your passion to the table as well as put in the hard work. Its a very competitive field to be making content in so you need to be willing to stick it through and work hard.
can i get this song on spotify? it's awesome
I wonder what Calli's headcount is. I'd say thirteen thousand six hundred and sixty-six
i legitimately wonder how many people have mentioned she takes a lot of inspiration from eminem. this beat style was one of his songs.
Это Просто Ахуенно!
im not a rap fan but this is pretty good
Great Art Stream Calliope, it was chaotic fun energy, ty for the streams, ty for the consistency, ty for the begging stream altus lmao, best shyt. ps this song sounds better if you like calliope alot, dunno why, Bias lezgo
This would go well with parasyte (the parasites take over people’s heads”
The captions tho
Ngl, this is *absolute fire*
the description, how many times do I say it, I'm not a human, Jesus Christ people.
日本人＋女性の人ってどのぐらいいるんだろう…語りたい
Basically, "Would rather lose to someone strong than to win without competition"
These songs are just as good as her past works... PAST PAST works.
Am...I a dead beat now?  Because I do feel a bit different after listening.
Art style and clothes reminds me that Ume girl from Kny. (I know what bow in the front means, before any lecture)
Savage !!!
oh no this is stuck in my head
I haven't got words for this talent. This is really amazing, I love this song. It's will be a favourite rap song ☺️ Good luck in the next productions
I'm currently competing for a chance for taking an international practice in UK and this song is pumping through my veins in all this stressful process, but I will learn to savour it. Thanks Calli, this is keeping me motivated and focused. I will to respecfully and straightforwardlly seize the opportunity with all I got, if I deserve it.
Ether 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
pog.
the subtitles. the vocals. i feel like im being reminded of 200 people at once. it’s GREAT.
🔂🔂🔂
Damn, what a banger
Right Click Video-->Left Click "Loop"
Turn on the CC... it’s god damn beautiful I love it (this is my opinion)
Im not a hololive fan nor am i a fan of rap but after hearing this song for like hundred maybe times im now in love with calli  and when i feel unmotivated or useless listening to this make me feel motivated. Thank you calli for making this song
❤️💗❤️
I'm not a english native speaker, It is hard for me to understand songs (specially rap), but now that I look up the lyrics of this song, I'm just going to say, that anyone that says that Calli doesn''t deserves her fame/success is just full of bullshit.
I mistakenly clicked the dislike button....how do i repent?
I wasn't ready
I'm not normally in to rap, but I've lost count of how many times I've listened to this and the Dead Beats EP. These tracks are indeed fire.
i dont know but it sound like ... NF the Slim Shady ??
I know I'm late but like.. That was very intense ride ngl.
Spotify?
和風音楽最高すぎる
*Here is my daily tribute my queen.*
After the fishing saga .
reapence.
your lyrical content has improved by 100% since the first song of yours I heard. I can't comment on your beats cause they arent my style. Improve your flow by 3% and you'll be set, for the most part you land your lyrics with 98% proficiency but you seem to struggle at certain point like when you spit fast work on your breathing and that should solve it. all in all id give it like a 6.5/10  which for reference is like an IGN 8-9 out of 10.
Damn
This song is amazing, amazing vocals and beats!!!!
Gosh, I freaking love how you make all of your own music videos, its gorgeous
"Off with their heads" - the french, 1793
I am still listening to this, I can't stop~ Now I am even dancing~!
This is not only a brutal diss track, but also a great motivational song. Makes you want to push forward toward your dreams, no matter how hard it may be at times. And reminds you that spewing vitriol just makes you more miserable and wastes your mental energy you could use to accomplish something.  Even if you feel like the song is directed at you (not only if you are an actual vtwitter goblin, but also if you can see similar behaviour in some areas of your life), the choice is yours: will you be hurt, or will you accept it as a lesson?
I can't stop listening to this song someone HELP
Somehow every new song she puts out is better than the last
1.16mill subs, my god the amount of quality human beings, deadbeats you have Yahweh's blessing, that's all. :Velvetcrowelook: Bless you reaper Mori.. I be like atomic samurai lmao and only acknowledge the powerful, KEKW
Calli if u can respond to this I was just wondering if u could give me some advice on singing, as I would want it to me my future career too
I like how you keep changing your style
Listened to this, and the video up next is "You're an ace kid" damn, that song hits different now...
Came back to this after cereal lyrics
I want to learn how to write rap like this
Calli are you DemonDice?
3.2 Million views in one month!!!☠☠☠ Calliope is on fire! 🔥
This cute lady In front of me are good at rapping but that song well let's just say that I'm not a huge fan
i feel very powerful everytime i listen to calli's songs
"Calli has no career" Also Calli :
日本人が見当たらねぇ！ てことは、地球規模で愛されてるんだな…nice music!
me wen someone saiy big chungus isnt funney
I come here again after someone tweet: "Deadwheats eating now, Grab the spoon and show them how,..."
i remember watching the premiere and i thought mori is gonna become a god
Alright, I admit. This is actually pretty fuckin fire o.o
Welcome to mountain top!!!!! Hoooo
My friend introduced me to this song and I can say I am not dissapointed
Alright just checking in, this track is still certified FIRE. Ok glad things are still in order. Good day deadbeats
和風な感じで好きです！
i hope a hololive nendoroids will be released soon...
Sadistic Sakura has 3 meanings: Sakura Miko, Sakura tree, and useless Sakura. Pick your poison.

*Off woth their H  A  i  r*
I LOVE U CALLI YOUR SONGS ARE AWESOME!!!!!! ♥️🖤♥️🖤♥️🖤
I got a recommendation for one vtuber clip and now the best way to describe it is, "HALPPP, Ive fallen and I can't get up!"
:0
Who's here cuz of the beat saber map?
❤
A lot of my friends have been trying to get me into Hololive through Gura and Ina who would usually be my thing, but in some bizarre twist, despite for my normal distaste for this genre, Mori's music is what pulled me into HololiveEN.
Would like to hear her make a cover of kiba of akiba
One word: Damn
Those who are really trying to make your dreams come true understand the meaning of these lyrics. But those who are not really trying to do will see it as a criticism. basically, how did it sound? Was it critical or did it make you feel sympathy? If you were critical, it's a sign that you're not trying hard enough.
Sounds like a geometry dash level no cap
Shes been taking our souls Our hearts and now our heads When will she be satisfied! ! This song slaps btw i LOVE IT
PYROKINESIS style
Don't challenge the 1st generation en vtuber she is OP
I'm not into this kind of music but this is epic 👍 Great job Mori
Exactly, do you actually think it's easy to get into Hololive?
Calli: worries about if her songs will be welcomed  Deadbeats: you change the idol genre in a good way who knew idols can rap like this the song is on 🔥🔥🔥🔥 No calli is her own genre and we love it
Why do i have a feeling she would be a final boss in a game and this song would be the song
So no head? ayt
My hardworking grim reaper can't be this badass
This song is so good
This gives me goosebumps, holly
🥰
I am addicted.
This just gets better overtime.
For some reason when I keep watching this vid I get a fnaf song vibe
Bone rattling.

This is calli talking to the God of Death about how she roasted people🔥💀🔥
900+ dislikes came from Vtweeters lmao pressed.
WAW 🔥🔥🔥
e
@Mori Calliope Ch. hololive-EN Can you public your songs on Tidal? You know your official profill with music
Unrelated, "mountaintop" gave me Vietnam flashbacks. Sunsetting fortunately got rid of *it.*
they are still incredible as before (◜‿◝) ♡
Это круто
💀🔥
Calli's such a great idol
o.o i wish there was a off vocal version to practice.
This isn't my kind of song. But damn it got me :0
Разорвать концепцию смерти во  всех воплощениях ради достижения трансцендентного бессмертия.
Привет из России), я люблю твою музыку, спасибо что ты выпускаешь еë;), продолжай в этом же духе, а я пойду снова переслушивать) ❤❤❤.
03-03-2021       898 rappers were salty about the fact all theyre efforts were outshined by a scatterbrain reaper and her deadbeats 😆
You can hear Kiara shouting KFP in the first 3 seconds  I didn't found this out but I thought it would be cool to let others know
俺の頭じゃ日本語でしか表現できないのが申し訳ないが どのオリジナルトラック聴いてもビートがとにかく殺人的すぎる  ヘヴィすぎるベースに訳のわからん特殊音で一発KOやわ
3M POG
なんかこれ聞いてると歌詞はあんまわからんけどやる気が出る
Well normally Rap isn't my thing but this is a very rare exception. Dang.
Nice disses
a part of this loves this song and a part of me finds it a bit weird and they're both equal so idk whever to like or dislike XD
How many times have I listened.. That's right I lost count
Congratulations on 3 million!!!!!!!!!!!
Me: Too lazy to do assignments *Listens to the song* Me: LETS GOOOO🔥🔥       If you're lazy like me you know you're not going somewhere so better do them homeworks      Don't worry I'll do mine too
Rap
Welp I'm not HEADING to the mountain top. I feel like i wouldn't know where I would BEHEADING.         I should actually lose my head now
Hmm yeah this might be your best song now it really is good
Three Million in 30 days. Good going deadbeats ...

Sounds like a more pop-ish Mad World song
3 million views!
SUGOI!!!
Congrats on 3M views Calli! You deserve it!
Mori calliope ERB episode when?
Заебись, чётко!
You don't even remember exactly why you were climbing this mountain anymore.  All that you do know now is the burning ache that permeates every nerve in your legs, as they buckle beneath you, forcing you onto your knees. the frigid air around you nearly freezing your own sweat to your body, sending wave after wave of chills up your spine. As you wrap your arms around yourself, the old, rusted katana you've been carrying clatters to the ground next to you. That's what it was. You were climbing this mountain, because you heard tales of a legendary dojo at the summit, that could turn the lowliest armature into a skilled master in a matter of months.  You had searched before for a great sensei, yet none seemed to live up to your expectations. They all went much too slow for your tastes. You wanted the best of the best. Not only that, but the legend states that you need not pay for this training, should you make it to the dojo in the first place. And with how poor your family is, and your picky attitude, this seems the only viable option.   You look back behind you as the cold continues to drive daggers through your body. Perhaps you should've settled? Taken the first sensei you could find? It certainly would've saved you all the suffering you're feeling now.  No. You erase the very thoughts from your brain. You've come too far. There is no way you're giving up now. As you shakily put your feet under yourself once more, using your family's only, heirloom sword as a crutch, every fiber of your being screams once more for you to turn back. Your feet have never hurt this much in your life. However, as you continue walking for what seems like an eternity, you spot it. A small building, built onto the side of the mountain. Through the driving snow you can see the lights, flickering from inside. You made it. It's right in front of you!  With eyes on the prize, the exhaustion evaporates, and you break into a full sprint towards the dojo, getting closer and closer, until you eventually sink to your knees once again in front of the door. Panting, you slide it out of the way, to see a warmly lit interior that, despite the mountain climate, is strangely comfortable inside. As if it were spring back on ground. Looking around you see naught but tatami mats covering the floor, as well as a singular wall over on the right, covered from top to bottom in various weapons and armor. The most displayed however, is an elegantly crafted scythe, hung front and center on the wall, adorned with designs of rose petals and sakura flowers.   It is only then that you notice on the left a stout woman wearing a starkly colored kimono, with staggeringly pink hair. She is sitting at the table under a kotatsu, sipping freshly brewed tea. As she lowers the cup, her gaze meets yours, and she stands, and walks over to you. Could this be the master of the legend?  Before you can stand to bow to her, she is already towering over you, leering down at you face.   "Another student, hmm?" She purrs, her face showing a slight grin. "You wish to learn from me?"  "Yes sensei!" You shout as you prostrate yourself before her. "I've heard from many a legend that you can turn even the weakest amature into the greatest master. Your strength is uncanny."  Without a word she walks over to the display wall, and causally removes the scythe from it, holding it in her fairly petite hands. "And what makes you think you are worthy to learn from me?"  "Well, I climbed the mountain! Isn't that proof of my dedication? Now you know how much I wish to learn!"  Within a flash, the woman is right in front of you. "And how do you think *I* got up here?"   With not another word she swings the blunt side of her scythe into your chest, knocking you out the door and back into the snow.  "Go back home." she says, "You're not worthy."  After she slams the door in your face, you begin your decent down the mountain. It's much easier than going up.   As you make your way back to your house, night has fallen over the village. Walking into you family's home, you head directly to your room, and as you fall asleep, you contemplate once again giving up. However, catching a last glimpse of your family sword before you drift off, your resolve strengthens once more.  The next day you climb the mountain again, and eventually arrive again at the dojo. You ask the woman a second time to teach you, and she once more declines. However, before she can hit you with her scythe, you use the katana in your hand to block the strike. However, it is not enough, and she knocks you out the door once again.  You continue this routine, day after day, week after week. Each day you arrive, climbing the mountain becomes easier and easier, leaving you more energetic for the fight ahead of you. Each week, you manage to block more and more strikes, until eventually you are able to strike back. After a few months of this routine, asking each day to be taught, you eventually manage to knock the woman to the ground during your daily fight.  Holding the rusted, chipped point of your sword to the woman's chest, you say, "Will you teach me now, sensei."  "I should be calling you that." She chuckles. "Don't you see? You no longer need my teaching. You've finished, and you've passed."  And then it hits you. Each day from the first, your resolve grew stronger and stronger. Each climb and each fight gave you greater and greater skill. You look down at your body, and you see the great amount of muscle you've put on, as well as the great amount of scars. You've never been this fit in your life.  You look down once again at the woman, and hold out your hand to help her up. As you help her to her feet, she bows to you, taking you by complete shock.   "This place is yours now. You are now the Master of the Mountain. I shall take my scythe, and take my leave. This dojo has all the accommodations you will need to stay here as you may."   As you look down at your sword, you see that inexplicably, it has been polished to a sheen, and sharpened to the point that you can hear it cutting the dust in the air. As the woman removes her scythe, the stand resizes itself, to a size that would fit your katana perfectly.  "You may have beaten me," she begins, "but don't relax yet. I will be back tomorrow."  Edit: Thanks Everyone for the support! I don't really write that much in my free time, but when something tickles my inspiration bone like this song, I can just let the words flow! I'll try writing more when I have the time!

Bow to the Reaper Queen
Honestly most of rap song (my opinion) i don't understand well but this mori rap song i understand completely. Hat off to you very talented
this is not my type of song but the lyric is unexplainable
wow! 1 month with 3M
I just came in accidentally. But I can’t go out now.
This song hits different.

Hello Comments!
Is it just me or does it sound like she's saying "Melon-Top"? 0:03
i cant take the beheading sound effect seriously i keep on getting reminded of among us
She went off
:D
The line "The train starts tonight" along with the bell gives me chills
whenever i need inspiration i think of this lol
Yo this was fire lol i love it
The song that could be sung only by the reaper
I’m just gonna start listening to this song whenever I need motivation to create
Honestly this song may seem cruel and vain on the surface, but I feel a kind of compassion behind it. Its like I'm being told "keep going, keep pushing, don't give up!" I don't see this as a self-satisfied diss track - no, it's more like a war cry
не плохо звучит ) качает !
Crazy how much has happened in the past half year.
これAOくんがmixしてんのか
straight up *blue fire*
Feels like I can come out with one or two more video now
we can hear all of those head chopping in the back
Holy fuck i just realized Kiara yells “KFP” in the first 3 seconds
😐
came here because i found this song via beat saber.... and holy hell its amazing, the lyrics even moreso!
Guys, call the Fire Department! The bars are too hot it'll burn California again
This song is actual fire. Dang I can't help but listen to it on loop so often.  Its like death filled sugar cravings.
❤️
I like your work very much, I hope to see more of your work in the future, and I hope that the translation has not gone wrong
for some reason this reminds me of flame princess....
love listening to herr voiceeee grrrr I❣
I swear she’s going to revolutionize the rap genre
In other videos I like how she changes her voice tone from a cute anime girl to rap tone
Heh, “fight till the nightfalls”  I thought you’d never ask me, have I ever told ya I love dynasty warrior type games. Ha ha  Ohhhhh bring it reaper I’ll kill what ever many till the sun goes down.
is it just me or do you hear Kiara in the background of the begining of this?
I like the song but the fact losers/smelly creatures who don't have a job defending this controversy and started it all alike are a nuisance to society and all of mankind. Its just an AI kids...
Man....Calli is so cool.
Wow.. Just..wow.. Just found ur vid in yt recommended.. Simply amazing😭😭
ビートが最高
Wow i see Tophamhatkyo in the credit area thats why i feel the same vibe from
Love it more with every listen.
week 4: TBAs **still** haven't recovered
"Little Miss Company Hire" Sure, becoming part of Hololive is pretty much a guaranteed 100k+ subscribers on day 1 by now, but as they have proven so far only the most talented people get in, so in the end those sub numbers are still earned through hard work, passion and dedication, and certainly not for having a large Tweets per day ratio. And I say that as someone who was very sceptical about a Hololive EN until y'all debuted and proved me wrong.
real talk, i didn't like this song at first (and not because of her message towards other V-tubers and entertainers), but the more i listen to it, the more i love it. you did a great job Calli,  I think for me, it's just listening to these songs more and more that gets me to like them.
shes using eminem lyrical style :0
This gives me demon slayer vibes idk why
A cute shark took me down a rabbit hole and now I’ve been given a scythe and put to work.
This song is similar in style to some of icon for hire’s songs
it's got an acquired taste but not bad
Beats are so damn good
Everyone's talking about the music genre but I simply don't get it, is this rap? Because I feel calli deserves a genre of her own
I'll be real sad if Calli doesn't get an outfit based on the one in this music vid.
this gave me goosebumps. thanks dad
That’s my Dad
Why am I making an animatic of an epic battle scene between two ocs I have
This is great. Kudos to the composer
🔥
please tell me i’m not the only one who thinks they sound like demondice
1.25倍で聞くのにハマってます。
the only english song in my playlist
The people that disliked this music are... I dunno what to say next, y’all can continue my sentence
Great song!
ooooh nice
I'm getting goosebumps
she is my waifu rapper,coolest ever
i think it's just my inability to hear words clearly but i'm not sure she said "start posting stop tweeting" anywhere?  idk people quote it a lot
idk personally i interpret this song as trying to say "if you know you arent ready, then don't try it til you're ready". it's definitely a problem i have, i keep attempting projects and leaving them alone cause i dont know how to do it. also probably about people overestimating themselves and claiming they're better than actual experts idk how to explain it
handsome
First time hearing this and it's fvcking glorious!
2:05 is savage
I’ve had this song on my school work playlist since release, and I dont tend to comment much. So trust me when I say that the depth of Calli’s lyrics , understanding of phonetics, and high standards for quality show up regardless of your engagement with her other work or community.   It’s actually the best demonstration for the quote “The master has failed more times than the student has tried.”   Even though her work is fucking masterful she still has the hunger and mentality of a student constantly trying to learn and look for new edges and refinement.     Thank you for all you’re hard work Calli. You’re a fucking inspiration. 🙏💀🎵
Why do I swear that at the very beginning I hear Kiara going kikkeriki
The captions are coloured-
flow: scuffed lyrics: edgy disappointment: immeasurable hotel: trivago meme: dead point: still stands
Why is this a drama? Is vtubers now a controversy?
Am I just hallucinating Kiara saying "WWEEEE!" in the background
Wow... just wow... im speechless
Someone map her songs on OSU pls.
usually i dont listen to stuff like this, but wow this is great lol
HELL YEAH
Beautiful....the music is like the late  90s and warly 2000s..  how much I miss the good old days..even when i was a toddler back then
; - ; how am i not subed "-- , --
クセになるわァ
Damn this isn't spitting fire, this just spitting straight lava.
This make me goosebumps ! ! !
すごい…… 英語少ししかわかんないけどとりあえず凄いことはわかる。 めっちゃ好き
Spirit Blossom Mori
God this is why I love Calli
I never thought Death can be this beautiful! 0_0
i bet theres an osu map with this song
Now we know why Hell is cold because Mori took the hellfire and used it to forge her bars     All in all a good song and I will be listening to this while I work out
Does anyone think she sounds like Demondice Karen!???😳😳😳
damn
Another banger👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
So they credited the artist and the camera angle really shows how good the art is You can really get a close look at that uhhhhhh ribbon yup ribbon Really nice detail on the ribbon
wow
comment section
WHY DOES THIS SLAP? AAAA
This song turned my step brother and I from haters to simps
Whenever I don't feel motivated I'm going to listen to this
Sadistic Sakura isn't a yuri h3ntai VN?
Damn
0:52 I love those metal slaps so much
Ngl im addicted to your music :P Cheers from Arg
Calli is on fire with this song!
This song hits different with the melodic parts and the switching beats
This usually ain't my kinda music, but this pretty good!
that "no ambition try again next week" legit makes me chuckle
So many burns I thought this was Kusotori's channel for a moment.
Even the captions are epic
Is this anime world
My hat's off to you.   My head? Who knows.
listing to this the second time is soooo much different.  it's like your eyes are opened.
Hmmm 3 weeks later
this beat is sick yoooooooooo
Most female rappers: Overcompensating try harding to compete with the "boys". This girl, naturally and elegantly slamming. I don't know why it's hard to find good female raps, but damn this was good.
A.O！？
If people get offended by this song then that’s because they realise their own faults in the lyrics.
Are you demondice?
Excellent work caill! I love it
This song kinda feels like a when an MC prepares for the last battle in a match lol or a League of legends music video
I love you❤
か‥かっこええ‥
Wow this is really good. there's this really good rapper named DEMONDICE, u should check them out. I think u will like them especially
Just imagine her performing all of her originals live in 3D; that's gonna be a glorious moment to witness
Someone's gonna wanna make a Guilty Gear Strive combo vid to this but also not wanna infringe on it without her permission

Mori you are a amazing streamer and music artist thanks for the music and streams good luck
I'll be your SLAVE.
My head is yours crimson queen 👑
よく見たらミックスしたのAo君じゃん！しかもトップハムハット狂名義じゃなくAo名義なのに嬉しみを感じるね！
other vtubers: King Calli: Off With Their Heads She's a queen    Disclaimer: I saw this comment somewhere and I just rewrote it here. If u know the original comment please give them my feather as thanks
Vtweeters... hmmm  Sounds tasty
Thank you Calliope, wow
OH SHOOT
Swinging Scythe.
PLEEEAASSE   I NEED THIS AS VINYL RECORD !!!!
DEMONDICE?
I need this. I'm still struggling to save up for my rig and working on my L2D, I'll just work and work and work. From an aspirant, thank you, Calli.  EDIT: I am not aware that people are getting mad over this, wow. Calli really did a number on them huh? LMAO. This is going straight to my faves.
ABSOLUTE DOPE-NESS!!!! THANK YOU MORI-SENSEI!!!!!!!!!
if Haachama covered this I would be scared...   REALLY scared
Cant wait till gura brings out her big guns
かっこよすぎる......  It's so cooooooooool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I uhm.... wow I wasn't expecting this to be this good omg  I don't enjoy rap ever except this. Make more please
Oh. My. God.  That was amazing!
the illustration felt familiar for me :v
Wake the fuck up Samurai, listen to this
If someone is upset over lyrics like these, they should probably stop and think about why they're actually upset. Nine times out of ten, it's because they don't want to admit it's a hard callout that actually applies to themselves.  You're doing well, Calli. Keep going.
I got roasted, but I'm not mad about it. If anything, this song just gave me determination & devotion to do more videos and get back into the youtube algorithm
Y e s
Thanks, I love it
to actually think some wannabes who were offended by this. Heh they are just too lazy imo anyone could stream and make content easily. Keep up the gnarly work Calliope aka Best girl of Hololive En. Heh I would love spar against in GG XX accent core
Still listening to this inspiring and badass music now. Now thanks to her my interest in drawing and photography is doing progressing okay even my YT gaming channel. And on top of that this is released on a day before my birthday so thank you for this masterpiece!! And also conGUHtulation on 2.9m views and 1m subs!!
Idk why people think this song is bad it's a complete bop and completely true. The lyrics are very true and you should work hard instead of repeatedly flapping your lips. Look at yourself before looking at others and complaining
It's funny how Mori got anime rappers attencion and appreciation
かっけえ
This song has such a strong Eminem vibe but I can't figure out which Em song it is
THIS SONG IS BADASSS
Imagine getting mad because someone who succeeded and is still succeeding is telling you how to succeed.   Idk, I find it absolutely baffling that people (small Vtubers/Vtweeters) are mad at Calli just because she told them the harsh truth. Being in HL or any kind of company contract yes does have its amazing perks and what not but you also have to meet their standards for that contract as well. In this case, Vtubing requires a SH^T LOAD of content, and a sh^t load of effort to make the content. Just because she is one of the ones on top of the EN Vtubers community doesn’t mean she just sits around and does nothing all day. Calli works her ass off day and night to deliver content that is god tier. In a sense, she works just as hard as the Vtubers (who actually put an effort) that are brand new to the game. In this Vtuber game (or any tbh) you win the game by actually playing it, not by talking about it. I myself am not a content creator in any sense, but I do know the grueling efforts most content creators go through. In all of the Hololives Girls’ cases though, it’s pretty much double the effort. They have to make sure that the audience enjoys their content, and their company does as well. Those saying that “it’s easy for you to say that” is not that they just randomly got picked for Hololive, these girls worked their asses off to be in the positions they are now. What you small Vtubers are experiencing now is just level 1 on this game, and so far most of you are already losing.   Not sure if my points make sense cause they’re all over the place, but I do hope this message and (especially) Calli’s message gets across to all of you *ahem* crybabies (or aspiring, hardworking content creators) out there!
Круто, очень хотелось бы трек на нескольких языках, включая русский. Cool, I would really like to have a track in several languages, including Russian.
I literally listen to this first thing when i wake up, to get my motivation early in the morning and its cool ❤️ if you didnt work for it then dont complain when you cant get what you want 💙
So, no head?
This fucking rocks!
oh   thank  you   thank you   for this  song
Please chop my head
Tehehe  Epic!, hmm that making me happy inside and out, love it!?!
歌詞最高だな・・・
Absolutely boppin to this as if I know what’s going on
let us please pay our respects to the fallen twatter keyboard warriors who never reevaluated their life decisions after getting so brutalized by a 2d girl that i'm pretty sure i heard "FATALITY!!!" at the end of the rap. they fought bravely, bravely but not well TwT *presses "f"*
A good song to listen when i am feeling lazy, very inspiring
me: I don't like rap music  also me after 10s : I like rap music
1. Wow. Love the song. 2. I just learned that people complained when Mori with over a million subs says 'It takes effort to be a Vtuber'. I believe it. I'm just a normal YouTuber (different account, this one's for watching vids and commenting) who is starting out and it's not all automatic 'You do X and then Y happens'.  Never change Mori. Never change.
just because you referenced that you're only popular because of a company hire doesn't make it any less true. you didn't work for this. your sword is blunt and unwieldy. but i'll stop tweeting and get back to actually creating something worthhile.
Oh nyoooooh... we got a rising empress... Contact the   kingdoms !!!  (I have no idea why I wrote this... Somebody: You were under Thought Guidance. Me: oh. Frik then.)
Scythe, Katana, Music, what's the difference? They all *slay* just as much! 💜
Just got done listening to it after delaying for many week now and my god, Calliope Mori got some really great talent in rapping. The ryhme scheme, the flow, the delivery, her voice, the subject of the song, all of them hits harder than Truck-kun hitting an Isekai MC. She legit need to  be featured on a big artist music cause she got the talent. Great job.
So that basically means every human dies, cuz there is NOT A SINGLE THING that is interesting in this World , Dimension, and Universe
As someone who's been a drummer for around 10 years now, but has stopped and just started wasting time for around 2 years now. This inspired me to finally start getting back on to it and my interests, rather than wasting my time. Thank you Calli.
I've never been much of a rap guy, it just never stuck with me, but I'd be lying to myself and everyone else if I said I didn't love every part of this.   I've been getting lazy. Slowing down. Call it what you want, I'm not as driven as I was. My passion to prove myself still burns as harshly as it always has, but I got lost somewhere and haven't acted upon it. That eats away at me every day I'm not driving myself forward, because I still want to reach that goal, I just don't know how.  The lyrics you've put down here have lit something inside of me, man. I don't wanna lose to anyone, not anymore. Tough love is right, sometimes it needs to be spelled out for you. I'll find a way out of this rut and never look back. I'll be damned if I'm gonna let anything slow me down again.  This all sounds really sappy, but thank you, so much for being you. Never stop being this cool. ❤
This is so dope
1 head 2 heads 3 heads 4 i  sub to your channel thats one head more x_x lol
Thank you for the motivation Cali, this song was the push I needed to take the leap!
Wow this ultra dope
those 857 dislikes...... I think you guys already knows whom asses those got hurt
T H E  S A D I S T I C  S A K U R A
Here for my daily listen.
Can't believe this sparked drama. This f**kin' was deadass reality being spat out. You don't step in the ring unless you intend to knock people out and expect to get knocked out. But you understand once you start you either are all in, or don't even start.  A true soldier doesn't fight to survive... they fight to die. Honey Badger mentality.
Damn she's talented
My head will probably already be taken off from nodding my head too hard to the beat ._.
" song track mix by AO "ってとこにもファンとしては興奮を感じるんだ…
damn, calli rapping actually slaps
Idol? Or..
I discovered Cali thanks to Trash Taste and I fell in love with her music
Esto es hermoso bueno además está muy chido, aver cuando hablamos jeje es broma peroありがと
So when is the album dropping ?
i already really enjoyed this song, but now its even better that i learned the context. Calli is straight savage and i love it! Haters need to learn and retreat or line up and get reaped.
this song is not only absolute FIRE, but it also inadvertantly introduced me to the small vtuber Kabhaal who reacted to it. thank you so much on both accounts.
This is pretty fire  Also I’m new to your channel and so far this is my favorite song
This song is so good, it should be outlawed. Also Calliope should be locked up. In Alkatraz. If you know what i mean.  *cough cough*
As a starting YouTuber, I just wanted to sincerely thank you for the encouragement. It means a great deal.  8{D~
Yknow the saddest part is actually that over 7.7 billion people are missing out on this masterpiece...
I really love your Style of Rap it remind me Eminem and I really like it ! 👌🏻
Oh yeah off with their heads 💉🚀😎
You have my never ending respect.
good lord this is brutal, amazing
I will never get tired of listening to this song! <3
Sound like the sans song
森さん、あんた最高だ‼️
After death.
ミックスAOさんなのアツ過ぎる
Soooooooo i listened to this on release day and i really liked it. now 2 weeks later the meaning behind the song clicked, and no mi fucking love it i know so many people that think streaming and making videos is always just fun and games and not staying up until 4-5 am making videos. i have made some videos in the past for like a month it was fun but i couldnt do i t any longer, bc the thing i did for fun started to fell like im working and wasnt fun anymore....... i had 20 subs so i was nothing  also all my videos were trash. barely edited andd the little editing i did was terrrible
和風×ラップかっこよすぎる
Easy breezy
In line with the rhythm of my endorsement ❤❤❤
Personally not for me
I totally love this
Yes yes give me motivation to do my school work and draw and make videos at the same time yes YES
Nah, can't vibe with the song but it's cool tho
Ok that's settled, i'll be swinging till the sun rise, thanks Calli
Can you add my head to your collection? Pls xd
thank you for existing
Nice reference of doom there
This reminds me of a lot of songs that I really like
This really reminds me of that jpegmafia and Denzel song.
Welp i found my new hitt workout music....
Peko
me: I hate rap. Calli:     me: understandable absolute banger
Every time I feel unmotivated, I just think, "What would Calli tell me to do?", and then I do that thing.
1:40 Monotone MoistCrtikal reference?
かっけぇぇぇぇぇ！！！！ カリちゃん最高っ
Calliope mori is the best person in the world and no one can say otherwise
The song is very well done but your voice is hard to hear over the music. :(
Not really disappointed, Mori, I like all of your songs.
I can feel inspiration coming
Idk it's kinda mid production isn't really nice and lyrics are meh
I felt like saying hi so ima say hi.......hi 😀
Normally I hear Deth Metal, but this is awsome!
MORI CALLIOPE‼️‼️‼️🔥🔥🔥😈🔪😍😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩❤️❤️❤️❤️💜💜💜 Waifu😍, Queen👑, Day Maker ✨💖, Favourite 😌😇
Actually I came here after your Godzillla, insta sub but now? Now I become new fucking fan! Pogg work!
Deadbeats: "CALLI! GIBS US ARA ARA!"      CallI: "ORA ORA MUTHAFUCKA!"
How does this bop so much? This is awesome! I agree with the message too.
This goes HARD
Sakura is finally useful
She is a IyricaI mastermind. Most of so caIIed "rappers" have nothing to say beside "money money yo" "I got pus*ies" or "check this out|". They got NOTHING on CaIi. She can sIay them aII and she doesn't even need a Scythe to do so. Respect.
Physical CD release, please
The amazing part is she calls it "tough love" in the song because people were upset to hear that you can't just promise you'll make content (like a lot of VTweeters), you have to actually make content. But it's not even that tough, she's just being realistic.  Less dunking people's heads into ice water, more giving them a gentle splash. And people still managed to take it as 'you guys are fucking losers lmao get on my level'.
So I used to like this song because of how it sounded. This time I really paid attention to the lyrics and I like it even more now. Calli is so badass!
You know what would be a cool team up for a song calli and corpse husband.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Best discovery I've made in month, love this jeez
Ughh those unlikes.... Their Jealous...
yes
I like to imagine there's other girls in kimonos with japanese masks playing the shamisen and mixing the beat while Calli raps
I'm usually not that interested in rap, but this do be fire  a slap in face reminder is needed sometimes
This pretty good
I honestly don't know what all the negative fuss is about on this song; Good job, Calliope. You made another slappin jam. I kinda like it more than R.I.P.
Hella badass 🤟
Calli in her songs is so different from calli with kiara and everyone else lol
this became one of my favorite songs
i can't stop watching
i listened this one so many times :D
Strong message right there! Even though it's hard for me to understand rap because first: english is not my native language and second: because I don't listen much rap in general and my brain sometimes can't keep up with the lyrics, yet I understood a main message. Great song really, thank you, Calli, for your great work as a Vtuber and musician, wish you good luck and power to continue kick ass!
God the intro  Literally  I cannot right now
After 9370373654832 times hearing it still hits hard, love it
this song is fire I'm loving the beats.
I'm interested in sexy voice.... But this works to I guess
This feels like one of those songs if your triggered by it maybe because it happened to you but not really also I love it
Calli burning someone while singing.  HOW IMPRESSIVE
I am eagerly waiting for Mori's next EP or album. It would be LIT.
Feel a Eminem vibe in a "spitting the truth" sense, instead of just talking about the theme she entertains while shows facts cleanly. Deliciously soul taking
Kimetsu No Yaiba x Calli
You're living rent free in MY head
this is... actually incredibly good
nice sound
I've recently learned that the name Calliope in Greek means 'beautiful voice' and that makes me extremely happy. Amazing song!
why is no one talking about the captions
this reminds me of demon dice omg
Every lyric in this song is legitimately perfect and just makes me want to 🛐🛐🛐🛐
Im getting chills oh god this is so good
I love deathstep♥
Soundtrack mix:AO AO!?!?!?!?!?
damn, Feminem really be making me feel different with her tough love
This isn't your first time here--  I keep listening to this over and over again AAAAAA
Video Editor:How Many Effects And Transition Do you want? Calli:yes.
She is killing it this year. First this and now the HoloLive ALT PV song.
Guess my head's gonna start rolling....     CUZ THIS SONG BOPS YO
I recently became a fan of calli and i wanted to try her music out and all i have to say is that.. can i get this on spotify please 💯🥺
I had been listening to this on my computer audio which doesn't have good bass so when I put on good headphones I literally just sat there, stopping what I was doing. This song is absolute god-tier and I love it so much, the best way to describe this is 3 michelin stars but instead of food its music
I heard "kikkeriki!~" in the beginning....did i misheard?
2021還在聽，hololive 的歌我都有聽（有夠滑 但是Calli 的聲線真的是很合胃口
...Demon Dice?
AAA I LOVE THIS!!
thank you Calli very cool  no but actually tho its big good
It feels as if this is Mori's version of YOU ARE KING except it is much better
Calli: Off with their heads     Haachama: and i took that personally
Wait I dont usually like this type of stuff but this slaps HARD
Who is this woman and how in the hell have I never heard of her before? The rhyme schemes and flow are fucking top tier.
THIS IS MORE THAN FIRE
Is this based of demon slayer?
You probs won’t see this but this song even if I diss track to a certain community , I’ve found it so fking motivational and ridiculously accurate. I need to cop on and stop complaining about people in positions I want to be and instead actually push myself to that position and take it for myself with hard work.
VTweeters; *Complain about stuff* Calli: And I took that personally.
Who ever may hate this, show us better and eventualy we may consider to pretend to be bothered. Otherwise we wont let you bore the boss.
!
meh.
This makes me want to work harder to achieve my dreams. Thanks calli.
I swear this girl is gonna surpass Eminem one day no cap
i don't want sloppy seconds  😢😢😢😢
The lyics in this one are powerful as hell. It's honeslty kind of getting me up and wanting to do something to push forward
Wait is this demondice?
You’re so great 😭😭😭I’m Crying
Mierda calli wow , this lyrics a hot and everlasting fire
Yey free rhymes for my project
2.3M
you chop the heads i boil the teeth
Finally, some female rappers who don't mention their p***y or something.
This song solidified her as best girl for me. From here on out cali, I'll stay with you.
Is it wrong I wanna see Calli rap battle with THHK?
I am addicted.
QUEEN!!!!
She sounds like a female, part japanese version of deuce. Same style.
Her bars are killing more people than her scythe is.
ほんとすごい
I never thought I would be a simp, until now
Poggers
Ngl, this one puts me in the fire of motivation
Is anyone else getting demon slayer vibes from this
Bruh imagine her doing a lofi hip hop music she going to kill the whole genre
Inspiration? check. Hot fire? check. Super Mori power? Check.  Yep. this is gold status.
"welcome to the mountaintop" "hope you're ready to be swinging till the night falls"  Even when you reach the top, the hard work doesn't stop.
I came here everyday
Calli: Off with their heads!  Haachama: “And I took that personally”
my headphone is burning . . . i like it
This is the ultimate middle finger to those loser vtweeters and I absolutely love it. 😍
POV: you are the next gen of hololive en and the potential en vsinger
I can't leave more than one like, so I'm going to leave a comment to help the algorithm.
やべぇ、クッソかっこいい
holy sh, she straight up told em hahahha I support  this
Tbh a stupendium x calliope collaboration would be incredible
I don't know how she does it, but on every listen I just like the song more and more. It's the same for her other songs, and they are practically all I've listened to for the last 3 days.
This song inspired me. Been listening to it when I need a pick me up, it reminds to keep being ambitious and positive in everything I do, even it it makes me bleed.  You are amazing Calli
Eminem been real quiet since this dropped
The funny part is that the V-tweeters can't even come back at her.  They either hold the L and keep doing what they're doing. Or make some kinda content as a comeback to her and end up just doing as she told them to.  Either way Calli is queen
Does the singer sound like Demondice to anyone else?
I keep coming back to this song. Damn girl, these lines are so 🔥, Satan is getting treated for 3rd degree burns after  getting exposed to it.
Thank for the advices Calli
I know its supposed to be about other things but I just hear a bunch of destiny references. Mountaintop? Nightfalls? like come on
"Start creati'n, stop tweet'n" oof, that's a BIG burn, guess she still wants to reap souls, if she can't do it phisically she'll do it with her music
What's sadistic sakura?
BTOOOOOOM!!!!
I just love this song! It's pure fire🔥
My house is on fire because I listened to the first 5 seconds of the song.  *This song slaps.*
i have zero idea what's going on here but i think i like it
Even though I'm not a Vtuber (at least not yet), this song is really inspiring to me as a writer, and comic artist and artist in general. And goodness I see so many of my artist peers on Twitter just start drama, and arguing with people like the Vtweeters do instead of spending their time improving and working on their art. This makes me want to go back to the grind and start improving my artwork more.
This gives me undertale vibes
THIS SONG IS A ✨ BOP✨
2:20 that sound gets me every time, damn it feels so good
Cheer up girl you need to take some rest don't be too tired keep yourself be healthy 😜😜
This song is the exact reason why I feel resonance with Calli. She's a fighter who keeps getting back up even if she has to climb back standing straight by a thread.
this is so good
Rice. Tastes good.
カリちゃんの他の曲もめちゃくちゃ刺さる曲調だけどこれは個人的に1番やばいかもしれん！  even though I love all Calli-chan’s original rap songs, this song is especially my favorite song!! you’re killing me!
Hand her a towel  Cuz she got drip
I will follow you !
lyrics are nice but don't like the beat this time
音楽AOさんだ！
Entertainment industry is fucking rough. It's not something you can just squeeze yourself into real fast. It takes so much motivation and passion and Really Fucking Hard Work. VTubing isn't your cheap ticket to fame. Don't be mad because she's telling the truth.
I love the modern hip hop mixed with traditional music
i fuking love the song!!!
I'll be honest, and say this gives me motivation to start getting my PC fixed so that I may be able to make my audio tracks for people again. It makes me wanna pick up my pen and write. Plus the music is 🔥🔥 the longer you keep doing what you're doing, the bigger a fan I become. Because as a bassist/vocalist I know what kinda work it takes to make these things work, let alone something you're actually happy with. Lyrics, are for as fuck. Thank you for providing an additional source of motivation!!!
omg the beat is just... amazing
This song was the song that inspired me to finally start learning music theory again so I can improve my compositions. Thank you, Calli.
I don’t get why people are mad about this, she has a point. If you’re gonna be a vtuber you should at least post live streams and videos and not just tweet about how someone you dislike joined the vtuber community
You did really well with this
As comment below me said im not Usually into this stuff or vtubers manly but I actually like this idk why you earned my sub
Calli : Off with their heads Haachama : And i took that personally
*I kindly offer you my head*
I'm addicted to this song 🔥🖤
the mtfckn beat made me crazy
0:06 *DIRTY MIND INTENSIFIES*
IM IN LOVE
Best rapper for me🤩🤩🤩from philippines 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
I'm using this song as inspiration to continue making my game again. I'm already much further than I was before, and in much shorter time. Thank you Calli!
this song pumps me up for the day!
This is really epic. I wanna get more into Vtubers, but idk where to start. Pretty much only watch youtube, not twitch or any other platforms tbh. Any tips? English, Japanese, its all good.
👍
This song is awesome 😎 also heads will roll heads will roll heads will roll on the floor
aguanta rap dud, 4 minutoh rapeando jjajajaj
firework festival outfit when? it would be so cool if you had a red spider lily kimono and a massive sword. would be great for a collab with ayame as well
Guys.. I don't recommend 0.25x.  Seriously... Play it normally
ARGHHH CRAXYYY❤🖤❤🖤❤🖤❤🖤
This is a fire workout track not gonna lie.
thank u calli for creating this, was so done with uni and started to feel like what used to be my passion felt like a chore. really needed this. Thanks again for kicking some sense into me. Time to pick up my pencil and brushes once again.
When a Vtuber makes an original song this tough, you know she ain't playing around! Just an incredible song to listen, love it
Hope to find this art on Wallpaper Engine
好き！(語彙力)
809 dislikes... it seems like these people took it presonally.  Impressive.
和のテイストが入ってるのに英語の歌詞っていうのが不思議な感覚。 まあなにが言いたいかって、最高。
Just take my head
Its like an ost of a game where the chapter is already going to the last boss
AOって見えて、あのAOか！ってなった 魂音泉好きって言ってたし得でしかないんだよな、、
Its stuck in my head now
THIS IS SO GOOD I LOVE THE BEGINNING
Im jealous my voice isint that cool
Did I miss something about the colored subtitles
This is so good omg
Idk why but when she said "welcome to the mountain top" i had chills down my spine
有中文翻譯嗎？
Can we please talk about the Amazing flow Calli has on this track? Sounds chaotic at first, but has a nice pattern once you hear it out and is amazingly clever
AAAAA QUEEN JUST DROP SOME BEST SONG THIS YEAR
I am happy to see that demondice made it
deadbeats swingin now grab the scythe and show them how. me and the boys: lets goooooo
I didn't watch vtubers before and now I watch vtubers
The only calli is the king of holololive i only love calli
I love it
Why do I feel like she's about to eat me? Some of us prefer not to be on the menu.
I love it when people create the genre of music that best suits their voice and personality :)
MORI IS A RAPPER SHE HAS ANOTHER CHANNEL WHERE SHE RAPS ITS PRETTY GOOD!!!!
I can't stop hearing your music thanks to random spotify shuffle..
Jeeeeeeez now that's talent straight bars
Welcome back mina san~~ This not your first time watching it like if you do... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Me: Listening to it everyday
Demondice!??? :O
Inspirational diss track.
最近毎日この曲聴かせてもらってます とてもかっこいい曲をありがとうございます(๑ｰㅅｰ๑)
Start creating, stop tweeting.  I'm thinking of joining your membership just for this sentence.
Yuh new song
Based af
Damn dis 🔥 tho :D
很好聽！！！雖然我聽不懂，但旋律很棒🔥🔥🔥🔥💯🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼 對不起我不會English😅
best one u will ever hear
遂にaoさんと…最高っす！
I'm an hour away from my debut stream and I've been playing this non-stop for the past day. I hope I understand how to get to where I want
THHK track is SAIKO-!
Headbang intensify
This is an amazing song . I look forward to more this song has made my day . You got a new subscriber  Plus it's a really good original song
Another fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
When Hololive EN 2nd Gen auditions got announced I only remembered this song.
the first thing comes in my mind was demon slayer-
"as id a million skeletons hit that subscribe for satire" SUCH FIRE
Never hit *+SAVE* so quick and hard in my entire life
Calling it now: when performing this live, Calli accidentally adds an 'f' to the line at 0:42
so why are there 2 uploaded videos of this?
Can we see Calli do video editing tuts please?
ラスボス戦感すごい 勝てる気がしない
where is the "forever repeat" button?
Massive flex
nice diss track calli
すごいかっこよい！(*´∀｀)
かっけえよかっけえよ
what is that subtitle
Calli i hope u read this , but i like the tracks were u spitt like this better then the fast flows cos sometimes because of the fast flow u kinda try 2 fit 2 many syllables into the bar wich makes the it kinda hard 2 follow ... do with that as u will just a perspective from a head .... oh and if u and gura ever make a song or tape .. u 2 should go by the name Sharper... cos shark , reaper... also scythe and teeth yaknowwhatimean keep it up tho 👍👍
Calli's willpower and drive are the things I like most about her and her songwriting.   It's a concept some of those indie Vtubers lack, making excuses, being deadbeats with no content, then blaming their lack of success on corporations. No refinement. No self-awareness.  Losers.
Haven’t stopped listening to this song for the past week! It fired me up to put more work and grind my streams! Thank you Calli! Keep making these bangers plz!
日本語コメいない🥺🥺
It's so accurate Calli's training to be a reaper before the instincts kick in and "the kinda pain you complain about but learn to savor" feeling like death and then killing and wanting to kill- I LOVE IT
2:28 2:28  で、ﾍｯ  って声聞こえるんだけど 2:28 2:28  これ何？カリオペの声？誰か教えて　　　　　　　ください
i like your rap songs. i want to study english so that i enjoy your songs more
This slap harder than daddy
Going up..
@moricalliope oh damn girl, Your rock.............😍😍😍
NAISU, I GOT ON THE 2M VIEWS
日本語とはまた違ったカッコ良さがあって何度も聴いてしまう…… 和風のイラストも素敵です！！
This is true in everything, not just about vtuber. This whole world is a fight.. we fight to survive.
Mori... I always liked you, but with this song and all behind it you just gave me the strenght to cotinue to make content and try to go farther and beyond. You are, right now, my inspiration.
Cali is not spitting fire. She's spitting Dragon.
Straight up fire - some of your finest work, right next to Cursed Night and Live Again, which are stellar.
Ok
BRO YOUR MUSICS ARE AMAZING WTF. glad i found you
Dont mind me just repeating this song 100 more times
So technically this is a diss track right?
God damn you god some sick bars mori
Ik mori worked hard a lot.. some people just dont understand but looking down on her
at the end of the day all that matters is how we project our insanity. I won't forget this. See ya when I'm a hololive idol Calliope. I hone my "Katana" every day
Has anyone noticed she sounds like DemonDice's singer?
I haven't heard of this girl until the drama but how did anyone think she was talentless? all these songs are fucking amazing
BRUHHHH someone fired back at this chick lol. Dude named BigBerd made a diss track for her
Of all the languages she coulda sung in, she chose faxxx
Don't mess with calli twitter kids
2:58 sounded like the discord call sound
As someone in the middle of a long research project, the line "the strong, the safe, the terrible -- progress in these eyes" really stands out to me, and I hope it resonates with others as well. Some days you have a major breakthrough, some days are just small steps towards your goal. And some days you're going to fail, it's pretty much unavoidable. But they're all important parts of your progress, as long as you learn from your mistakes and don't let them keep you down.  Thank you for writing this song and lighting a fire under all of our asses. Listening to it on the way to lab helps me get ready to take on whatever challenges my work throws at me. I've got a few more years of climbing ahead of me, but I can't wait to meet you all at the mountain top!
For some reason when listening to NEFFEX auto play I ended up here
Congrats on 2M views in one week. That is crazy and just shows how great this song is. Never give up and keep on fighting.
Super animation
I've been listening to this on loop off and on since it came out but I never left a comment...wonderful music as always!! I always look forward to your uploads, and this was just as much of a treat as your songs always are :]!
I wonder how Calli would sound like with slower rap like stan or sing about me
Not really into this kind of music  But this is actually pretty good
Amazing song! , my blood is boiling. Goosebumps also.
In other words, you wanna be as successful as her? Put more effort into your project than your social status. And trying to "cancel" them will get you nowhere. I like to think of Twitter as the Venom Symbiote. If you let it take over you, it will control and ruin your life. Control the Twitter Symbiote and your life will be as near successful as Mori.
Yo, you kinda went apeshit... Amen.
Congrats for 2M!!!!
The Song Was Awesome
Got a friend trying *really freaking hard* to start arising in the VTuber run for a few months, so those lyrics kinda hit hard and true. The flow isn't the only one thing that is TOTALLY ON-POINT with this song, lads, I tell you that...
Is this the diss track?
This song is second only to fubuki's glasses rap
Damn this is why i dont sleep just watching vtubers
Never thought I'd have a song that would encourage me to keep fighting, looks like I found it
Holy awesome... Women are cool after all??? Eminem
日本語訳つけてくれてありがとう
The video isn't as good as 'Excuse my rudeness, but could you please RIP?', but the song is fire
I love the vocals and the lyrics but there is something about the track that just resonates so deeply 10/10 would and will listen to again
Look, they, how my boy massacred!
Yup, this is my favorite song
Welp, I'm feeling motivated! Let's goooooo!
those are some nice lyrics 👀
And yet some people are so sensitive and only complain, totally ignoring the beauty of this another banger.  Cmon, just enjoy good content.  Compliments to you, absolute fire 🔥🔥🤘.
I like your music now calliope is rapper
Rabbit hole huh,I guess I'll stay here for a while
I LOVE YOU SOO GOOD ❤❤💕
god
Ayyy 2 MIL💀🔥
Congratz on 2 millions view Calli
Started working on vtubing on my end and having this song come out around the same time has been a blessing. I was able to think more clearly about what I want to accomplish, how I wanna do it and it's a good reminder that even on bad days, as long as you don't give up you'll get somewhere and that somewhere is proportional to how much effort you're willing to put up with. Opportunities and connections can help get a headstart but if you don't do anything with what's given to you, you won't get anywhere! I know i'm gonna have to work extra hard because of my throat disability but i'm not letting that stop me anymore, I found something I really wanna do and I have a clear goal in mind!
I like how her hair resembles a red spider-Lily cool little detail
2 Million views HYYYYPE!

Congratulations on 2Million!! This shows how our reaper's efforts are paying off, keep streaming guys let's reach more achievements!
2M 🔜
I've become so lazy with online school, pretty much to the point I'd (pretty much) given up on all my goals and aspirations. I haven't studied for my finals and they're soon. I can't believe I let myself give up on my future because it was hard, and spending hours doing nothing is easier. Thank you, Callie. I need to kick my ass into gear and do something with my life.
I keep hearing ''welcome to the melontop''.
Every time I come back to this song it refuels my fire to reach my goal. Thank you calli for all the motivation and inspiration you have given us.
Why do I get such an "Icon For Hire" vibe about this?
stan callie 👏👏
Bra shots fired take that tweeters
You're an inspiration.
The easy part is thinking of how you entertain your audience, making sure they enjoy it and having fun. The hard part is that you have to do it every single day.
I've listened to this song for several times now and I just wanna say that this is an absolute masterpiece! You really give me inspiration to become a vtuber also someday (though idk when but probably in the future!)
Calli, you've easily become my favourite artist these past few months. This is because you've opened up a whole new genre of music that I would normally shrug off since I really don't enjoy rap that much. However, you've introduced a whole new light to it with your fantastic voice and singing style and I'd really like to thank you for it! Keep on doing what you love!
hacchama took the title seriously
This reminds me of Tanjiro's training in demon slayer
This song gotta burn my mind
O KITSUNE  SAMA (FOX GOD)
Im not really to rap music but I love it since Mori do it. It has a sense and meaning unlike most of rap songs nowadays.
Its soooo goood lets go!
10 day....we are close to 2mil deadbeat!!
I can't believe I missed this released because of my old computer. I'm so glad to be back on the internet and to be able to hear such a great song TT
字幕に力を入れてくださってありがとうございます😭😭　練習しやすくて、とても嬉しいです！！！！！
I know one thing from listening to all her songs, I want to support her the best I can as well as hope for even greater heights for Calliope the Reaping Rapper
The song was so good that my youtube crashed😂
I don't usually like rap, but wow, this is hell's fire
I came here from her trash taste guest appearance and figured I'd listen to the music before anything else. I was definitely not expecting to hear an artist I was already listening to beforehand. Had to do a double take like, "Wait... Isn't that???" This song rules, your music has such a distinct bite to it 😤✨
Hey can u remove the end cards, or move em, they are blocking the lyrics a bit
Why does this sound so familiar? I think it sounds like a vocaloid song I’ve heard before maybe?
I can't speak ...
I love this one~
God, this song got me through a rough patch at school, so thank you, so much for this
Realy love the song
和と洋の混ざり合いカリオペに相性良過ぎやろ
This is such a bop I heard you saying you made music in a clip I saw but dang this really blew me away
Seeing people create has been really inspiring.  People founding businesses, creating songs, creating games, or creating the communities around them.  It's really something to behold.
uhhh, i just saw this video as an auto generated video by youtube it had 250,000 views wut? are they trying to reduce the original video view count or something?
why is she just hearting every comment without replying to them  cool song btw
Aaaaaa mori so good at rapping, im not into rap but damn, this is so good!
Some people saying this is harsh or something.  I didn't know I'm a masochist.
Haachama
Calli be schoolin fakes 🤣😂
Calli blows me away every time
THIS IS SO COOLL!! :DD
This is a great song for motivation for anything really, it’s straight Fire.
I couldn't write burns this scathing and laser focused if it was what I went to school for, god DAMN. Also, this is motivating as all get out, so thank you for this absolute bop.
In light of recent events, it seems Haato took both the figurative and literal advice of this song.
Calli: Off With Their Heads Haachama: "And I took that personally"
Why is there another upload of this with comments off?
it's getting kind of hot in here
that was REALLY good
Goddamn those beats
Damn calli spiting Bars and facts here🔥  Sasuga shinigami idol👏
Damn calli back at it again with another banger🔥
Im not really into the electronic music but is great to innovate and doing new things sjen you like to do it, as a musician i apreciate when some artist want to do something new
I don't even like rap music but Calli's song are straight fire!!!
I'm not good enough at English But I want to say This song is really GREATTTT🔥🔥🔥
This is actually good compared some rappers or other singers I call just mouth diarrhea good job to you keep up the good work
Pure fire.  Nothing else but PUUURE FIIIREE!  You tell'em Mori!!
Bro rap isn't my Thing, I usually don't like rap, but like, SHE'S SO GOOD AT IT THAT I'M STARTING TO GET INTO IT
The ‘g’ in the graveyard sign is on fire
Ok so ignoring the fact that I've probably listened to this over 100 times by now, the message behind this song really means a lot. I'm prone to giving in to my laziness, to the point where it's not just harmful to myself, but those around me. As much as I know that I have to put in the work to do the things I want to do, I just find it really difficult to motivate myself. This song has really helped me with motivating myself to start making changes to improve my life.
Just confess it’s funny that there anyone who can legitimately be upset when one of the top advice for doing well at something is try hard admittedly it can get a bit more complicated than that but that is the first step to succeeding and without it you will just fail the only people that can succeed without trying hard are people who are so absurdly naturally talented if they were actually to try they would be the best in the world
hey, i just love this song i´m not a fluid english speaker so i can´t undetstant all of the lyrics but i relly love it :) pd: sorry for my bad english and greetings from Argentina
her flow is so unique i love it
I didn't like rap pretty much, but Calli's rap is one of my favourite genres. Here take my head.
Actually I dont like Rap Music much. But your Song kicks Ass. Keep going on with that, Calli :)
I'm not usually into raps but I am somehow intoxicated, how are you doing this– every song you just make are so-✨
Calli's song is original so she has topic channel auto-generated by youtube. If you combine this video(1.93M)+topic channel(220K)+Spotify(490K), the new song already has at least  2.64 M views. not to mention other platforms like iTunes.
Can someone explain why it appears twice on youtube? with the same date and also from Mori but with no comments
Damn Queen. Why you gotta call us out like this.
FAKE TYPEがtrack作ったやつやん
I guess I've just been living under a rock. What exactly did this catch hell for?
Is this the song equivalent of a napalm strike?
Haachama took that personally.
This shows each vtuber has talent that shows their true strength  Its acually quite amazing You have something golden here that can fall into the history of everyones recommended and can be listening to this stuff for a very long time
I Can See Why My Fellow Cultured People Simps
Dad!!
日本の英語テストのリスニングは「日本特有の英語（日本で独自の成長をした英語）」だから難しいけど、カリオペの歌は聞きやすいね。少し分からないところもあるけど頑張って勉強する（╹◡╹）♡
Those Indie Vtuber is gifted with FREEDOMS but those Fuckers ONLY WANT A TEMPORARY FAME WITHOUT FACING THE SHAME.
It just keeps getting better and better
Looks like I'm taking that cold shower after all.
almost 2 million
THIS IS SOME HEATTTTT
This a good work out song. Just when you think you can't work any harder calli starts dissing you and suddenly you're pushing to be better. Or taking it as it comes, I don't know, everyone's different.
woooah almost 2 million! letsgo!!!
2:05 is my favorite
Start creating, stop tweeting. ✨
Haachama was here
my goose got humanbumps
Okay
1.9 M
People keep saying that she wouldn't be here without hololive but remember, hololive searched for TALENTED people and not a bunch of creatures with no jobs that complain about things that aren't even about them.
Just listened to this song for the first time, despite not usually listening to this kind of music... Holy *smokes,* Calli. That was *AWESOME.*
Haato's head?
Last 100K let's goooo
This song if FIRE! But seeing the title, all I can say was....  TO THE GUILLOTINE!
Ngl this actually has anime op vibes
Calli: Off with their heads! Haachama: G L A D L Y
Um,this is a bit dirty but,um I got an e___tion.
Ooh damm this hitting hard in multiple ways
this song is basically the only thing that remotely gives me motivation anymore, thank you callie <3
After this Original song something bad has happened
IS THIS THE VTUBER EQUIVALENT TO SHIA LABEOUF'S "JUST DO IT"?
The real-time highlighted captions are so good
200% motivated! SHOW ME YOUR MOTIVATION
Damn, the lyrics cut. Awesome
- I don't feel like getting outta bed... *listens to this* - LETS GOOOO!!!!
Does any DEAD BEATS know the next song is in March or April?
Can I join you, reaper-chan?
Imma play this during dance routine or me trying to imagine getting revenge from my bullies
Awesome
I know this may be directed somewhat at aspiring vtubers, but it can be applied to everyone. This song injected more fire into me to keep going. The grind sucks but it's part of life if you wanna get anywhere. And in the end, even though you suffered, seeing what you've created makes it all worth it.
I'm listening this after seeing PewdiEpie become a vtuber and I love it
The finest reaper around.
Ngl i feel RAMENGVRL vibe here, an underated woman rapper from asia. go check her out if u r interested.
ホロライブって音楽ブロダクションだっけ…
オリジナル!？
Editor : How lit you want this to be?  Calli    : Yes.
B U R N  🔥🔥🔥
My neighbors love this song.  Or at least I hope they do since I always blast it at full volume.
This made my epilepsy mad, but it was so worth it.
i wish i knew how to animate, this track would go great with a fight scene
Look at all dem fake Vtubers writhe in pain from the sick ass song Cali made for them...
I see literally nothing wrong with the song?  Someone explain the drama to me...
Hm i just got an ad of get bubba d..
It’s weird that as a metal guitarist for 25 years, the most inspired I’ve ever felt in my life is thanks to Calli. So much drive, talent, and brains. Don’t take it personal people, this song was a call to arms for all creators, there’s no better time than right now!
God that chorus is so good
Thanks for the kick, gonna hit the gym after work from now on.
Destroyed by Calli
Man, Calliope is such a huge inspiration to me at this point.  I'm planning to start streaming, since entertainment is something I have been wanting to do for the longest while through my life. Seeing how hardworking Calli is, and how much she works for her goals genuinely gives me so much motivation. My financial situation ain't the best so currently I'm actually motivated to be saving up, to get stuff necessary and commit to it. Plus, it is really the first time I have been so passionate about something, getting a feeling I really gotta do it, especially after living in the fear of future and not knowing what to do. And now this song is giving a huge amount of confidence and motivation to keep trying to get that start and then keep going. Will be definitely listening to it throughout my entire journey to motivate myself and do my absolute best. Genuinely, thank you so much Calli, I'm really glad I got to discover Vtubers, and with that discovering you and your content :)
Noice give me a  chill
Road to 2M guys!!!!
remove the taint of this world with beheading *i like it*
Just found this, this is lit
be a nice Vtuber
i dont know why a lot of people are hating this song but i like it so uhm nice song Calli
Hero Hei sent me. I am not disappointed 😎❤💀☠❤
Without me noticing I listen to this everyday 🔥
Yeah comments are BACH!!
I almost gave up because it was really getting hard but yt kun recommended this song to me... I got motivated again to do whatever I was doing, thank you Calliope Mori ❤ Sorry for my english
If the Doom Slayer were lyrics
Songs super litttttt, let's go!
Welcome to another episode of "Why is this in my recommendations like everyday?" Not like I'm complaining anyways.
I'm sweating too much because this is absolutely Fire ma duds.
Does anyone notice  the recommended song on the video list is from the topic channel(auto generated by youtube) rather than this video ( both are same song but two video)?
I actually didn't understand it at first but the second time I watched it, I realized it was like reverse psychology of inspiring.
Omg, fits so well with a playlist I've been putting together on spotify!
Is it just me or does she sound like Demondice?
однозначно лайк
Bruh if you are offended by this and her advice then thats seems like a YOU problem lmao
Honestly, sometimes tough love is the way to go. I started watching your stuff becuase of your personality and it really shows in this song. I like it alot. Great job making a real banger Calli.
感謝
0:39 "You'll get your rent when you FIX THIS DAMN DOOR" - Spider man
This can’t be how I fall into the Vtuber hole...
かっこいい
英語全然わかんないJKだけどこの曲凄い好き💖
Honestly her best song yet. It's got the polyglot wordplay, it's got a good unique tone with the koto, and it's got a MOTIVATIONAL AF MESSAGE.   Off With Their Heads is our generation's Alec Baldwin speech in Glengarry Glen Ross
V-Tweeters: "How do I succeed?" Calli: "Make content." V-Tweeters: "I do though." Calli: "Tweets don't count." V-Tweeters: *"REEEEEEEEEEE!!!"*
Best Track Yet!!!
"Those with devotion to the mission, straight devour the weak" -Calliope Mori Shinigami.- never give up on your wish or you'll prove it was never your wish to be strong but what you greed for. The ones who do not give up see their wish come true. they make it come true. you might all have the same wish but what maters is how you make it come true.
Tough Love: The Rap
"Start creating stop tweeting" That made my day
Even without knowing some of the words from the song after I've been sitting there for almost a week, I can translate it normally, and you know what? Remembering how Calliope Mori tries and continues to try, I can only get a huge motivation from this song, because if it all worked out, then maybe everything will work out well for me in my life with the right effort? I will not back down and will not give up for anything now this is my slogan.
Im usually totally not interrested in this genre of music. Idk how she does it, but i really love listening to her original songs.
Dunno who will ever read this but... Calli's whole "Hey, it all payed off" story is so F*****G inspiring.   I used to draw with a passion, and even if it took me days to make something even remotely decent, it was AMAZING when i looked at the picture and thought "Hey, I really made this one".  Over time drawing became like a chore, i was criticizing everything i made and resorted to shortcuts to get stuff done quickly and people could praise me. But it wasn't my content, it was almost fake. I ended up not doing anything anymore.  This song actually told me to move my ass, and today I picked up my pencil again. No tracing, just references, and I started to *draw*. It's not pretty, it's not excellent, but it's mine, and it's fucking great to be proud of something you made.
HELP I'VE FALLEN AND CAN'T GET UP
Holy Fxxx its slaying my ears!!!
"Start creating"  Oh I'll make damn sure of that. Heh. Just wait.
I don't like rap, BUT...
So we're just going to ignore the fact that Cali is an unliving, walking guillotine now?
大好きだぁ"ぁ"ぁ"ぁ"ぁ"あ"!!! (かっこいい可愛い最高好き大好き)
Listening to this over and over, I really feel with this song. It gets frustrating when people think that doing something is really easy, but they don't do it themselves to see how hard it is, or don't put in the effort and yet view it as something that should be easy to do
THIS IS SO SPICY
Uhhhh that
"Is your boi actually a master at Dark Souls?"  "no, but she can tell you 'get good' in other ways."
Flamesssssssss 🔥🔥🔥🔥
At 2:05 SAVAGE
There’s a chance that someone knows about Calli only from her music.
I think i found a song to listen to that can get me pissed during a fight
+Уши
👏👍
The dislikes are from the kids in the streams and the vtweeters
最高にかっこいいよカリ！ 誇りを持って活動を続けて！私たちは応援してるよ！ ありがとう！！！
Am i blind? Cause i didn't see Kiara's comment in this video
I dunno if anybody noticed but her hairstrands going in different directions resemble a Spider Lily.
the line "as if these moves did not take heartache and these tracks are not fire" still giving me chills everytime i listen to the song. such great spirit lifting song dad sensei!
0:52 - 1:36 at 1.25x speed. Bars.
カッコいい！！
honestly I love your songs Calli I know it sounds pathetic and melodramatic but it brightens up a dreary and otherwise pathetic world
this is always going to be on play whenever I feel procrastinating about doing something. I dont really feel threatened by the song but I feel really motivated seeing how hard work after all the hardships will pay off
"Facts" ladies and gent. This is what rapping is all about, You hate you take the L you like you appreciate her and for the clueless one and just like the beat is understandable.  The amount of hardwork effort calli did on rhyming, spitting facts and bars is just absolutely amazing i really really appreciate d it, thanks for this fire song!   P.S. i simp on calli forever.
🔥
Does this remind anyone else of falcon shield?
Omg this is even better than before
Part of me says, "get 'em, reaper girl". But most of me thinks "this is actually the best possible advice." She makes some good points. Demanding to be respected, having the attitude that others are obliged to give you everything you feel that you deserve, giving up as soon as anything isn't exactly what you hoped for... None of this is a recipe for success. None of this will do for anyone what genuine hard work, dedication, and persistence can.
Welcome back 🤣
f this not playing on my funeral im not dying
I'm in love....
youtber這種紅海市場要破百萬訂閱的難度哪裡是那些還在岸上不敢下海的觀望者敢想的。 或者說就是他們知道很難才不敢真的出道。 最後只好酸一下都是靠HOLOLIVE。 哈囉，HOLOLIVE的能量有大到隨便捧人上百萬訂閱那他們旗下藝人就不會老是被拔營收了。
haachama took this song too literally....
ngl this ws best for me
GREEEEEEEAAAAATTTTT!!!! DAMN!!!!
am i going insane after listening this for so many time or does is say aya in ames voice at 0:45?
my headphones unplugged  bad news: my parents house burned down good news: cali gained 2 new subscribers
help me my head i shaking to much and is gonna fall off soon
Haachama took this too literally 😳
Hatters: wow that’s way too harsh not even a good rap Mori: thanks for rent tho
calli: off with their heads  haachama: good idea!
🔥
Tbh this is super inspiring.  It's a good reminder of the kind of balls-to-the-wall fighting spirit it takes to succeed.  I know it's about VTubing, but it works for anything, I feel like.
Fire
We're DeadBeats So let's die in the Beats boizzz -Vietnamese bro-
Those dislike are the Vtubers whom can't accept her "Tough Love".
Ah yes 10/10 best song
I have hear the ither song and i d!ed and now again *dies*
o love her "rough" voice, it isn't girly but because of that it makes her sound so much better on tracks like this
2:26 Nothing but molten fire facts. Best part
I only listen to real rap :)
Dang.
I love the beat but i also hate the beat
This song is not f-wording lit, it's a raging inferno!
lov
Man, I usually hate the genre, but this shit's good as fuck.
*antis starts crying * (even more)
Haachama's theme
This is now my workout motivation song
This song is fire but let's not forget how good the editing is
Bro this reminds me of demon dice
This kind of reminds me of Falconshield's league songs
of all the Brazilians who watch you congratulations on the music
Ngl as an independent Vtuber this gives me such good vibes... I have seen too many of the indie side complaining, but not making any content. I do hope this wakes them up. Vtuber is not a title virtual is tuber or streamer part you get when you make content. Deal with it.
WARNING, FLASHING LIGHTS
1.5倍速にしてみな 違ったカッコよさで無限に死ねるから  Try 1.5 speed Die endlessly with different coolness
Delivering such a powerful message that it's hard to imagine a person not pausing and going "Am I working hard enough for my dream ?", whatever that dream may be.
Every content creator motto.   "stop beating yourself/tweeting/slacking off, and create content/work for it/change your destiny for better".  You success not for been gifted but for work for it. A genius never born genius, he was made by himself one.   Many times i though the same: "what if fails?, what if nobody likes it?..." then again ... you can't know if you don't try it. You can't climb the same peak if you didn't put effor on it. Me (an illustrator/ artist) , Calli , even Yagoo himself knows that feeling of betting for something and risk to climb the mountain or fade away.    Calli ... keep it! just KEEP been yourself everyday. Same for all Hololive.
Haachama to Haato : Excuse me,    Haato(off with her head) Haachma is Death Sensei confirmed !!!
i wish i can get an accapella for this...would be dope.
Akai Heart R.I.P.
Love 💕💕💕
Haachama...
👌👌
I think Haachama took your advice the wrong way xD. That said, loved this one. It actually heavily inspired me. As harsh as the words are, they're not spoken with ill intent. Aside from how cool it sounds either way. Gotta love it when a song combines meaningful lyrics with awesome sounds. Keep up the good work reaper rapper. Never stop doing your thing. Look forward to new people emerging fron the ashes after this song.
Haachama took this song a little too seriously...
The illustration, especially her hair, somewhat reminded me of red spider lilies which was usually referred to death and goodbye in hanakotoba.
Damn straight, this came in at the perfect time Calli. 'Bout to make a name for myself in this next chapter of my life.
You got me, Calli...   I was being a blaze on my workings; but now... all gone (Maybe my working schedule really hits me after 2 years...)  My Passion that once gave fear to some people (certain Game Dev - if you know that) were gone and only left is total emotionless (and total loss of motivation) Arctic Heart person standing right in front of my own mirror...  I have no idea if I actually need someone to re-light it or leave it be... So tell me, Calli... Have a light...?
She has bars
Something something Haachama stream
Everything about this song is amazing. カリオペだいすきです！
not sure why there's an auto generated video of this song by youtube, it only has 100k views but still why fortunately i thought of watching the original instead
Calli really felt the need to call out how I selfishly envy others instead of improving and perservering in the fields I criticise them for succeeding in, huh? This honestly helped open my eyes a bit...
'The kinda pain that you complain about, then learn to savor.' Reminds me a lot of being married - you may complain, but a lotta pain and work have to be put-in to make it successful and worthwhile.
"Start creating, stop tweeting"  This here a slap to the Vtwitters deadass
Прекрасная песня
Everyone in Hololive: KING Calli: Off With Their Heads
dnt know why but this reaper remind me of emimem.. dmn so good
This song reminds of those old fnaf songs
Holorap Generation when
Are queen make songs
"Im glad i live inside your head but who the fuck pays my rent" Damn 😶
I know i just start to watch hololive 2 days ago..but please accept my head as an offering
Turn on The subtitles it's way great
Like the new song calli!! always do your best! 😃😃
Bruh every time I hear your song it reminds my old shadow days where I'd probably be playing this in the background while getting over a thousand kills in my favorite FPS game.
Calli: Ya want a balanced following? then start creating, stop tweeting Deadbeats: Let's cheers for their funerals
I love that i love this
FIREEEEEEEE!!!!!!
This is Lit 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Not bad,not bad at all
Damn, this is an absolute bop
6日でこの伸びはやばい 本当にやばい やばいやばいやばいやばいやばい 可愛いよりもかっこいいって言うよりもこんなに伸びてることに対して涙がでた いつも聞いてるよ
Mori did to V Tubers what Kendrick did to rappers on his Control verse....   Now we wait to see if this is gonna make the others get in their bag
We will always appreciate the hard work any person puts into anything they enjoy.  I thoroughly appreciate the wake up, call if wanna call this song, in the vtuber community
This is so fire 🔥 🔥
I liked this the first time, but the more I listen... the more I like it.
this track is really dope and make me feel "MOTIVATED" to do what I wanna do
Es que Calliope Calliope esta bien basada
I ain't gonna lie this is a fire rap good job cali
Sick Beats says the Dead Beats
Well Calli, I think they're already dead
I've said it before on previous songs, but I'll say it again.... this is not my genre at all. But hot damn, the pure talent here speaks for itself. And speaks so strongly that I can't get enough, regardless.
Behead me onee-san !
Dang this is 🔥
Mori calliope is making Hololive more popular.
As some one is saving up and planning to be a vtuber someday this song keeps me fired up. Thanks Calli for spitting facts and tough love. I promise I won't be another annoying vtweeter and I will work hard!

Hey,i know this snare XD
AOさん…！ やっぱりサイコー(≧∇≦)
This is the type that gives me the kick in ass I need to stay motivated. The anvil sounds gives me chills, sasuga reaper rapper and thank you.
I feel like this song needed a bit more lead in, but I really like this one overall! Also that art is amazing!
Power move let’s be honest
Hola 👋😀
can't get enough of this
"As if a million skeletons hit that Subscribe for satire"  IT IS TIME FOR THE SKELETON WAR!! DESTROY THE FUCKBOYS!!!!
0:06 Why do you think i don't do that already 24/7? DARK SOULS FOR LIFE!!!
other Vtweeters: *puts hate on this tsundere reaper* me, who's playing osu! and Tetris more while in the planning sequence of being a Vtuber: don't mind me here haters, just gonna listen to on of the top Vtubers (seriously, do content not tweet, don't be like me: only plays osu! and tetris just because I only have a potehto laptop and can't handle really compact apps like obs that goes 30 fps to 25-10 fos just because of lag)
Make a diss track ok Eminem so we can have another killshot please
It's so goddamn good i can't stop replaying
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
かこいい——！
just perfect
今まであんまりラップ聞いてこなかったけどカリオペの影響でラップに興味が出てきた！
This is great, can you wear the clothes shown in this song with the mask
I see this as both a diss track and a motivational one as well. Its a huge diss to all the people who go into this thinking they're gonna get popular quick and then give up almost immediately and take their anger out on people who actually paid their dues and are successful. Its also motivational to the vtubers who are in it for the long haul and are ready to work for it. Honestly, as someone whos planning out their streaming schedule and getting everything ready to start, this song pumps me up. It makes me want to fight even more now, and I'm even more excited to start my journey soon. ^.^
Fuck it, now I wanna become a Vtuber, just to spite these... VTweeters? Forever-TBA Vtubers? Sure I'm a guy, but whatever, just some hard work and a bit of ingenuity, and succeeding at this job as a underrepresented, less popular type would be even harder blow in their faces, and even more fun for me.
Wow (っ'-')╮=͟͟͞͞💌
Awesome as always, a very good lyrics and message, thank you calli for teach a lot of lessons of life and carreer in all you song, you are my favourite :D
11/10
i dont know how no matter if i dont like it at the start, i'm gonna get it 2 or 3 more times in the span of a week and in the end im going to be shouthing that likes like i don't know anything else...... just one problem, its me or the instrumental its a bit loud compared to the voice?
Name: AO It's hard to find
I aint strong enough to swing that scythe, but you can bet I'll keep trying to lift it and take it with me.
Let's go to 2M!!!!!!!!!!!
gah Calli loves her viewers so much   and we her
Love ur songs calli. Keep up the good work. Don't mind those jealous bunch. Ur good!
Haha cool
I've been listening to this for the past 4 days already. Fire!
0:02 Kiara, is dat u?
Pop an mori calliope to make the pain go away
Thanks for help us to shout out. LOVE YOU!
The only shinigami I simp for
I'm so speechless that i have nothing to comment but this.
(｡･ω･｡)ﾉ♡
yooo
This feels like if FAKE TYPE turned into a girl and slowed down his singing pace.
今の英語圏Vtuberの環境はVtweetersで溢れてるって感じなのかな？　そしてその一部には「企業だから成功した」云々のやっかみで噛み付いてくる奴らがいて、そいつらにカリちゃんが山の上からダブルFAQしながら「ゴタゴタ言わずいいからステージに上ってこいや！」ってぶちまけてるって解釈で合ってる？ 歌で殴り合う文化は知らないから新鮮　日本以外でもどんどんVtuber文化が盛り上がって欲しい
This is such a great song to listen to to inspire you to work on what you're doing. At least it is for me.
This song is SOOO BADASS <3 <3 Listening while gaming is so nice
Is mori the reincarnation of JT machinima? (Despite him still living)
Well, I'm hooked😍🤩 I think I'll still react to this after my head rolled off my body🤣
Just perfect
Listening to this song makes me feel like I can do all most anything. It helps me much to just get myself up and moving.
remind me of yae sakura from honkai impact 3
YYYYYYYYY
MURDER
Weak-minded people see this as an insult. The people that look to make it see this as motivation. Simple as that.
This is, as the kids say, "A banger."
IDK why but so many people, including myself, got so motivated after hearing this song ! I listened to this song without reading the comments and I thought I was the only one, Fortunately I'm not ! ! Come on Deadbeats, let's create and show them what we GOT ! ! !
No idea if it’s been said, but man is that transition amazing. It’s normal but cool and just adds a touch haha
You are god
I just noticed the KIKERIKIIIIII in the beginning lmao
Did anyone else get some kind of Demon Slayer vibe from the lyrics and the mask?
0:01 Is that the sound byte that my Fellow Shrimps suspect is Kiara?
Idk why but this song makes me cry, because one its true and hits me. I've been an artist for a few years now, and I've had progress and been also laying around being lazy. Which makes my progress back to zero. And this song is a great advice to people like me.
dude i didn't even know about the vtweet fight until this lolol
She sounds like japanese Ariel Bloomer
I just love the blacksmith ish soundtrack, it’s like a interpretation of “Strike the iron when it’s hot”
I like it.
Wack how a good chunk of the vtweeters wanna say that the novelty of being a vtuber isn't pure anymore but they themselves are the ones tryna jump in on it to make a quick buck thinkin it's somethin that'll require no effort then get hurt by gettin called out on it. Issa breath of fresh air havin a reaper come in and completely slaughter twitter instead of bending the knee to them and giving then an ego boost
🖤🖤
Normal speed: *Fire* 1.25x speed: *Hell Fire*
Imagine being called out for tweeting and not making content and your response is to rant on twitter about it.  Wanna shut her up, make good stuff.
The title just straight up reminded me of Alice In Wonderland xD
Dont worry call, we, your loyal deadbeats will be standing with you on the mountain!
at first i thought it was a megurine luka song lol
I classified vTuber into artist.   As someone who wanted to enter the world of art in the past, I would comment that artist is a constant knockout competition job(just like the movie black swan)    When I was a student of  a “super-frontline”theatre and opera director and a pianist, my piano teacher said audiences are cruel. Indeed, how long you practice, the audience thinks you are doomed, then you doomed(reminds me the movie birdman)    Back then, my teacher was fortunate to go to a world-renowned school to study music. He had a third-place classmate who committed suicide at school because he could not accept he constantly rated as the third Everyone will only focus on the mountain top, no one will ever have time to look at the third.   The art world is an industry that cannot survive just by  passion and hard work, passion is easy, hard work is basic, everyone can be passionate towards something and hard work is not even a pros but a requirement in artist world. Arts also requires luck and contacts, so my director teacher said playing art is just like gambling.    When he first went to Broadway to see every dancer warming up, his master said: "Look at them, they have spent their entire lives just to get a role to become a supporting actors on stage."    So, without this perseverance, I would rather  earn money obediently and be a bad audience (?
Me and her on a mountain fighting? I would turn her into a masochist.
So, uhh.. Genius Verified when???
This is the 666th video in my music playlist...I can't think of any more fitting for that spot. On a related note, not only was this absolute FIRE, but it was also nonstop truth bombs. 10/10, 10/10, 100/100
I swear to god this game gives me the ability to headshot people ingame or irl
Watching people respond to this saying " Oh but Calli has Hololive / Corporate backing, that's why she's successful! " not only clearly didn't listen to the song but also know nothing about Calli or where she's been and the work she's put in to get to where she's at now.
Play it x0.75, more tasty of this song!
好き......！
This song really be going hard.
Where Did My Head Go?         Mori Calliope: Ara Ara~
立派なお〇胸ですね(今更)
0:52　ここだいすき!　I like here!
Congratulations, you made me like rap again.
This track is pure fire, dang. keep it comin'
This kinda gives off a five nights at freddy's vibe fr fr 💯
THE ART WHY SO BEAUTIFULL ❤
Ill be honest, i understand the pain of these things happening, but no can deny the talent Mori has, Im just glad she's doing what Mori Loves.
People who be getting hurt need to take life less seriously and vibe with the good beat some more <3
狂おしいほど好き
CALLI GOATED ONCE AGAIN.
"Off With Their Heads."  That's what the french said 😏
02:05 Is that Korone?
This song kind of reminds me of Eminem "survival" song and I don't know why
Those, SNARES
There’s something actually like kicky Ricky in the background of the beginning
This art of Calli always reminds me of Hanatan
The trap beats were so LIT! 🔥    My favorite is 2:20. The way Calli said "Welcome to the mountain top" is just 💯
1.6M
skr
Though it's not a ton, I'm glad to see what you put out.
Not gonna like I thought I was going to be in the 'I'm in this picture and I don't like it' crowd but I'm glad to say I am one of the ones relieved Calli is taking this picture, rather than being in it.  By the way, what's step 2, if step 1 is making content?
this is the song i really wanted to say"this song slaps"
Man Cali wants heads as much as King Hassan from Fate.  Bet he is yelling "DOKO DA!!!" to this song right now.
I was watching the Q&A between Kiara and Calli, and you know what, it DOES sound like Kiara at that part
I’m getting demondice vibes
AOさん！？（トップハムハット狂の方） 魂音泉の中でも随一で好きな方がまさかミックスとは... ありがとうございます！Thank you!
this song beats harder than my dads belt
Cool
"No ambition. Try again next week." love this line
Man, that's burn
Aaaaaa this’s masterpiece 🔥🔥🔥😍
This song was amazing and i like how this song gives a message that you need to work hard and actually do something if you want to achieve your goal. I aslo think that this song has the best visual and art so far and I can't wait to see more of her songs.
Someone call the fire department, this 🔥is spreading so quick.
Hearing her say "sucker" is oddly nostalgic.
Listen, 0:38, i had to do a double take at my cat
can someone actually give an example of a vtweeter because people keep mentioning them but i haven't ever seen a single one
To dismiss the colossal effort of an individual due to their fortune of having a safety net is incredibly, stupendously *foolish* Being a part of HoloLive didn't make Calli great. That goes for all of HoloLive's talent. What makes HoloLive great *is* the talent. Talent like Calli. The entertainment didn't appear from a vacuum; it was bled for.
I'm gonna be honest. People that think you can achieve anything without working your ass off really don't know anything about life. You can't get far with just people supporting you, you have to be prepared to give your time, sweat, blood and tears in order to succeed. And in this song, Calli is basically telling you that. If you don't want to work til' your body breaks then don't expect much for you in the future. People achieve everything with their own work and not with other people, but on their own. Don't be jealous and don't waste your time complaining when you could be using that time to achieve what you really want.
2:53 - 3:04 this is so good
I have some water nearby, because this song is FIRE!  Legit, I'm looping this for a few hours. Love it. (Also, that lead at 0:03 reminds me of The Eagle has Landed by Avatar.)
This is another great song you've done, I can't wait to see how for you'll go😎
My boy sure looks so bad ass
I can't wait for a diss track. I know you'll absolutely SLAY it.
Bring it, reaper. Saiyan pride or bust.
thank you the 353
somebody get some callico jack for the twitter-tards
In my worthless opinion, this is your best track yet.
I will now use this song to not only use as a motivation for me, but also motivation for people around me. Thanks Calli for an amazing song!
This song is just great, I dont what to say anymore I listened it 30 times in a row on spotify.
I got wet by this song.
Is it just me or are songs that only feature cali where she has entire control of the flow better? Or I'm just a sea creature (ykwim)
really terrible that people will dismiss your talent just because you're part of hololive. sure, it's a "safety net", but that doesn't mean you're not a great entertainer/musician. i don't doubt you worked extremely hard to get to where you are now, and i commend you. go away, vtweeters
Now i just can't unhear the two Kiara "kikkiriki"s at the beginning
added to my motivation playlist lol
Kiara's saying kikkerikki in the background at 0:05
Ive found more motivation on death herself than in god, ironic isn't it? (No offense to those who belive in god)
Sick.
OH YES I CAN SENSE THE HEAT FROM TWITTER
i didn’t even realize those were youtube captions, it’s so fancy
LOL, this got a Japanese feel to it.
this is her best song. don't @ me
Whats the name of this genre? I wanna find more artists with beats this sick.
I like this song. It was written with passion and infusing us with feeling ^^ To be the work of the "Lady of the last breath" I feel a lot of life inside
I'd like to be a vtuber one day. Not in a place to start right now but I'll do my best to make content lol.
Ok, ngl this is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥CALLIOPE A GANGSTER. This give fox’s wedding vibes
"But it must be how you're waxin'" ugh... is this a reference of "wax on, wax off" in "Karate kid", and a metaphor of sloppy training or should I lay off that ganja?
I feel the groove, now I'm motivated!
This reminds me of the dream smp
AO is TOP HAM HAT KYO!!!! TOP HAM HAT KYO’s most famous song is Princess♂ Everyone know !!!!!
Whattt fue hace poco
I'd honestly rather do something humiliating on stage in public than post a comment but f word it,  I didn't get into the university I wanted last year, and other backup plans I had had to be put on hold, and worst of all I couldn't see any of my friends and and didn't even talk to anyone I knew for the entirety of last year, honestly Hololive and especially you, Calliope Mori,  made me so much more happy last year, especially all your music and seeing you put so much passion into everythimg you do has made me want to do something. I got into a different university this year, not something I love but something I like and know I can doand enjoy, I've started trying to wrote something, hopefully I'll get to talk to people this year, and maybe I'll even get to see my friends this year, thank you so much for all the words you've given us Deadbeats this past few months, yeah
I LOVE THIS SM I CANT GET IT OUT OF MY HEAD, GOOD JOB CALLI
Possible rap battle *ULTRA THONK*
Take my soul, my queen
WHO THE FUCK SET UP THE FIRE IN MY HOUSE
This song reminds me of what my dad told me a few weeks ago.  I'm also an aspiring vtuber but I have some self doubt cuz I tried doing a couple passion projects in the past but all of em ended in failure cuz of circumstances I couldn't control.   When I told my dad this, his response was: "if you keep thinking that then you might as well give up now. Just release your content and keep doing it. You'll never radiate confidence if you're not confident with yourself" That came from a 50+ yr old man who doesn't understand a single thing about vtubers.  So yeah. This song's and my dad's "tough love" encouragement are really inspiring. Makes me wonder why some people are offended by this. But yeah. Keep going Calli! Know that you've inspired several people with this song. :)
I'm not sure what all the fuss is about, but looking at comments it seems some tweeters picked a fight and got their ass kicked?
Based Calli
i heard a kikkeriki at around 0:01-0:05
Yessssss this song is fire!
If I have any problem with this song it's that I think it needs some sound mixing so that Calli is more audible; the beat is a bit too loud and she's hard to make out against it.
学校の英語科をしっかり勉強しようと思ったきっかけ
I posted this comment on a commentary channel a few days ago that was discussing the triggered "Vtubers" that were upset about the fact that this song exists and that Calli and other Hololive idols are so successful. I kinda wanted to post the same comment here. I don't think it really needs saying, but I will say it anyway; Calli deserves every bit of attention she has gotten, as do all of the other members of Hololive. The amount of time and effort these girls put into their streams, music, and art shouldn't discounted or ignored. We Deadbeats, KFP employees, Chumbuddies, Teamates, and Tentacultists are grateful for your girls' dedication as entertainers. cool cool  Pasted comment begins here:  "Her success isn't down to herself it's because of hololive." [this is an excerpt of a tweet highlighted in the video mentioned above]  I mean, to a certain extent, this is sort of true. Hololive gave her a huge amount of attention. But at the same time, she was already very skilled and pretty successful when it came to her music BEFORE she joined Hololive, which is why Hololive accepted her in the first place. Cover doesn't just hire randos off the street. She worked her ass off for years, and Hololive sort of gave her the big break she deserved.   This whole claim is similar to this little hypothetical example:  Mangaka makes very good manga. Manga gets adapted into an anime. The anime adaptation is successful and in return gives the manga and mangaka more attention. Critics claim the only reason the mangaka is successful is because his manga got an anime adaptation. Except the reason why his work got an anime in the first place was because it was already very good and successful enough to get notices and picked up.  Like yes, part of the reason why he is really successful now is directly because of the anime adaptation. But that animation adaptation would've never happened if he didn't already have the skill to make a good, successful manga.  The end.  song is a banger tho
The louder the better.
Is it just me or is the bgm louder in the spotify version
"I'll gladly live inside ya head but who the fuck pays my rent" that's a mentality Every person Who make Entertainment for your people's pleasure should acknowledge Bars
that cadences pocket and rhymes sceme tho... literally fire from hell
I hate female rap songs, but Mori gets a pass from me
This song is magical, after listening to this my chronic procrastination disappeared...
Please, I need someone to make a Osu! beatmap out of this. That would be so cool, but I can`t do that. Ouh and Calli, I think that this is your best song yet
This is going to be stuck in my head even if it gets lopped off.
So after hearing this song a few times, an inspiration hit me that I haven't seen anybody else comment on it, a little blurb in the lyrics that nobody else seems to have caught:  Later in the song, she goes "though this hell is ten times hotter than the start" .... this, to me, is saying that Calli's life is _even harder_ now that she is a part of Hololive and it's kind of like a lightbulb moment. The standards and demands placed on her now that she is employed by Hololive are higher than what they were when she was independent. She got hired by Hololive, yes, but she has to _maintain_ that. She can't just sit back and relax now that she's joined a company. She has to push herself to do better, to put out content worthy of the Hololive brand.   Earlier in the song, she mentions that she "wretches endlessly about their excuses" and complaints, well... I imagine for anybody who joins a company like Hololive which places higher demands and standards on your work, seeing someone go "Easy for you to say, Little Miss Company Hire" would make them wretch because it's so wrong and ironic. Hololive does have perks, but yet it comes with _responsibilities_ and more work. Hololive gives better rewards, but yet requires more work. It doesn't make your life easier.   I've not seen anybody in comments raising this point about that part of the lyrics, so I thought I'd offer that here. I don't know if that's what her intended meaning behind that line was or not, but that's simply how I interpreted it.
Это. Просто. Нечто.❤❤❤
Gives overlord vibes.... I like it
Dang, are people getting mad about this song saying you have to work?  That's sad. I'm sad. Why are people so lazy?
The throne will be yours again  (This is so cool)
How the hell did she do that with the closed captions
See, this is why YouTube needs to add a loop option.
Another one straight to downloads
又有事了，又有人對號入座了
Amazing!!!!
Еперный театор
I luv this
The subtitles are a different color, Cool
calli's music deserves every bit of popularity it's gotten
Wow mori Calliope your sing the best sis
Amazing 😍
love the beat to this :D very nice
DUB STEP NEVER DIE'S : D
I love the song its catchy
damn, miss mori slapped the haters up down left right
0:41 ここすき
Look at the likes to disliked ratio. Can we stop talking about the 'outraged' 0.1%? They are insignificant and their opinion has no real value over any other opinions.
Good luck my bois, Remember my fellow future independent vtubers, stop tweeting start making content.
THIS is the real rap, not the nowadays one
I want love please👇
ハムさんとカリちゃん合わさったら最高に決まってる
Yoooooo this is pretty fire thooooo 😮
Ok, thanks for the advice Calli, I decided, you're my role model now, I'll follow your steps, you were my first favorite EN Vtuber and now you are my inspiration. Thanks to encourage the community in your way. Thank you again to be here with us. And this is for every Vtuber, thank you for changing our lifes.
Mean while me just seating back eating popcorn, seeing those vtweeters Yelling at twitter is fun to look at.
Wonder will you do another remix version campaign?
Go Calli Kill Em Alll!!!!!!!
I wonder how many people simply aren't aware how famous and accomplished the Hololive vtubers were WAY BEFORE they debuted - some of them were straight internet legends.  I think many if not all of them would probably do just fine even without Hololive.
Take my head... You have my mask... What else do you need? My soul? Go ahead take em all.... I don't need em
This song then suddenly insert a bit of chorus from Suisei's superb vocal. Yes please
You’re a good person, and you care. You make good music, and you share it for free. I didn’t know there was some problem going on, and  there shouldn’t be. Thank you for remaining real to yourself, and us.
I think i heard this before, i just can't remember
I usually don't like hip hop or rap, but this song beats is so lit, the lyric is flaming, and the rap is roasting. I love it, subscribed!
Love it.
At first, @1:37 didn't seem to fit for me. I thought the call to Death-Sensei was just to help stay in character or the like. But having relistened more times than I can think of, it started to make sense in the context of the message, like "Even my Sensei hasn't ever done anything for me. No one's throwing you a rope here" Which also plays as a sorta callback to Dead Beats with her Sensei giving the ever helpful advice he did
You're good at rapping. Create more songs like this.
this remind me of hollywood undead, i like it :D
my god this is corny
Take my head my lovee💜 Hope i get noticed been here since 50k subs
the song is fire
GOD
英語で和テイスト最高、、！！
かっこいい... あ、日本人いますよね、、？
I cant stop listening to this
the timing on this track drops is just perfect with all the vtuber crying about a certain youtuber joke, maybe if they spend less time on twitter, they'll actually become a better entertainer
Bruh who fucking cares this songs fire 🔥🔥🔥 keep it up calli looking forward for some more great music, and also collab music with other vtubers 🙌🙌
You blew my flesh off I am now only a skeleton
wait, do you have a tattoo
<3
This song committed arson on my house
1.5M!! 500K to go let's speed up!!
Why do I feel like I want to keep trying until I succeed now?
Thank you very much for the awsome music.
Ok, this makes much more sence with context.
Niceeeee!!!!
Everything about this song is pretty fire. Lyrically it is straight forward and extremely relatable. The pace is synonym to the effort and dedication required to succeed in competition. Overall everything about this song makes me go "Yeah, this is a pretty good song."  But then there is that one line "Welcome to the mountaintop" and its delivery in particular. I just can't get over how good that one line is delivered.  Even at the top the fight goes on. There is no sense of having achieved a set destination. So you reached the top? So what, think you're done now? There is only greed for more challenge. This fight is eternal. It's not about the mountaintop, it's all about the fight.  Calli could have delivered the line more deadpan like some of the other lines. Like, 'here we are'. But she doesn't. There is greed, passion and it is even issuing a challenge in the way she delivered that particular line. And it is exactly that which makes that line soooo fucking good.  Without that line, this song would have been a great song, but 'just' a great song. With that line this song is made eternal.
"I'll be waiting at the mountaintop and train till the sunrise to cut off Muzan's head" -Tanjiro probably
wow
This video had more investment than half of Twitters content backrounds  Toxic Twitter: how dare u-  Me: GET OUT GET OUT!!!!! U HAVE NO VALUE SO GET OUT!
in four days, you've just got me to finish a novel script that I left for a year. Now I'm going to read it and fix some parts.  "Start creating", yeah....
well i want to be a vtuber but i still dont have any model on my screen yet i hope i can get one soon and be a vtuber :(
歌詞がもう最高級の芸術なんだよな……好き…
和っぽいテイストで不気味な歌詞の歌最高すぎる…イラストもめちゃくちゃ美しい…妖艶なカリオペ様じゃん…
Death has spoken.
Sheeeesh the beat 🔥🔥💪
Mori is kinda like Eminem, whatever the haters say to her, she just uses it against them.
あなたは本当につよい人だ。 私にはそんなつよさは無いけれど、このまま何者にもなれずに消えていくのは嫌だ。 そう思えたよ。
I don't even know how many times i listened to it. 🔥🔥🔥
1.4m viewers atm after 4 days Reaching 1m after 44 hours  How many head do you want to beheaded Calli?
You just gotta love the lyrics. And the RHYME MY GOODNESS.
Anyone  think this would be perfect for doom
声が癖になりますねぇ！
I've been listening to this a lot since I myself am in a bit of a mental spot, and this tough love is what at least myself needed to keep pushin and stay motivated! I've been admittedly in a mental fog that I'm slowly but surely gettin out of and this song always helps cause its like,  you gotta work hard to get to where you wanna be and of course there are bumps in the road, and its gonna hurt. I love that this song is a huge reminder to keep goin! Keep up the good work Calli!
Damn... It's good. Good job Calli.
In the event of an accident, would you like to donate your body to science? >No  In the event of an accident, would you like to donate your soul to the reaper's collection? >Plz step on me
I’m sorry for not listening to your songs sooner Mori. First time listening to you, and you definitely live up to the hype. Keep up the good work.
またイケイケな曲作っちゃって…
Love the art
I keep listening to this idk why
I was waiting for this song to be available on the itunes store like a kid waiting for christmas, thank you for the amazing song and for all the hard work you put into it, hope you are enjoying your vacation.
"no ambition, try again next week" is a big mood
Yo this is a bop
I think I have listened to this upwards of a dozen times and I genuinely think it only gets better. It may very well be my favorite from Calli so far, which is always a feat because she truly outdoes herself every time.
This gives me the same vibes but opposite energy as "How Bad Do You Want It?" by Tim McGraw. The main difference being McGraw talks about the road to the top whereas this feels like its about the fight to stay there.
u r so cool
"start creating, stop tweeting" all facts on god she don't miss frfr. PRREEAAACHHHHH
Moisture
dont even care bout how cali looks irl her/his (cant be too sure these days) voice is enough for me
Ngl, this kinda slaps.
What's this about twitter? Actually nvm don't tell me, it's better if I don't know This song is a banger without context. twitter bad.
一つ通した筋が最大にまで鋭く尖って圧倒的に刺さる ペラペラなお気持ちをツイートするなら創造しろ。まさに。 何か思うたびにツイートするだけの自分も含め奮い立つわ。
This...  I actually have pretty crippling self doubt at times and I can be indecisive, but this right here makes me feel like I really can reach for the sky and take the sun, moon, and stars in the process!
Off with their heads..... until there is none
"Welcome to the mountain top, " Don't forget she or anyone have to climb up the mountain to reach the top.
Calli's just encouraging the vtweeters to make a diss track back, so they'll actually make content instead of tweeting all day
Damn I almost forgot to listen 100 times to this today.
*Save to playlist*
I JUST REALIZED THIS IS THHK WORKS? WOHOOO I CAN'T BREATHE- I FUCKING LOVE IT
Vtuber DebutTBA.
Wuuu..i love this!! 👍 Keep up the good work calli
This song has some AO's vibe in it!  And I love it😍
FIREEEEE  🔥🔥
This reminds me of TopHamHat kyo. Love this song btw
You just made me do my work, be productive and produce good results that will benefit my life. How dare u
Likes: 185k Dislikes: 686. Not even a thousand. That says about those noisy little haters, they so few.  More of this miss Mori, this is a banger!
The first time I heard didn't think too much of it, but that's just how I am, I need to hear it a couple times to really understand how good something is and appreciate parts that I may have missed. Now I love it, good song.
OwO this is good~
I feel like this song can really impact the other VTubers. The VTweeters don't relise that just because she was hired to HoloLive dosent mean she was hand fed her way to that position. People don't know how to deal with the truth. They always need it sugar coded. Calli is just being honest and the deadbeats are agreeing right with her.
Hook for the next song should be hoes mad
Sasuga desu Mori -sama <3
If not for these idiots on Twitter, Calli might not have made this song. In a way the twits actually did something useful for once.
トラックをAOさんが作ってカリオペさんがそれをラップする最高の組み合わせですね！
The part where she said "And although this hell is ten times hotter than the start, I ain't tired, thank God I'm death or I'd have drawn my last breath and peaced out, or retired."   This is coming from her experience herself because she had a different lets say "account" prior being part of hololive and she had around 100k+ following there and as per line above, if she haven't been a part of hololive, she might not have handled having the following she have now better if she's still with her previous "account".  My opinion btw.
bruh this needs an osu map
Is this really the song that causes so much controversy? It is not JUST a very good song, but it is also supposed to be about not stopping after failing, what is the bad part?
yeah no i definitely have been missing out by not getting into vtubers
Hits my heart!!! Thanks Calli! Ill do my best! I tripped and fell but I am standing up and trying to climb the mountaintop again.
this is the best one yet :p love the motivational theme. Your dedication and devotion to your passion shines through and paid off, and I will try my best to get there too!
This aint it
I just love how deep the lyrics of this song is Calli! Great job as always!
why does this give me goosebumps
*pulls out the guillotine*  Oui
wow  this is wahuu!?!?!?
-Calli gives advice for these vtweeters to stop tweeting and make content -Vtweeter got offended and decided to take a break.... Lmao
How many times will it take to break the Like button? Because holy FUCK this song is AWESOME!! 💚
I'm just a vibing soul.
Our cute Reaper strikes again with a blast song I'm still kinda confused how people can't get the general idea behind this song and just crying for being assaulted Jesus, guys, work hard and stop crying so one day it will come back to you
Mori mad
RIP is still my favorite but this is the best track you've dropped so far. I feel like too many people still look at you like a vtuber that raps but naw you are legit AF
I wish I could hit the subscribe button again!! AAGH
🔥🔥🔥These are flames!🔥🔥🔥
all the dislikes are the vtweeters being mad
Beat kinda over powers her lyrics
SLAY SLAY OMFG GIRL SLAAAAAY
calli : It is what it is
🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯🕯 It’s perfect!
i thought i was straight-
Sempai spiting the honest truth
Twitter when
the love of my life♥
Zero two eres tu????
The people hating on this are the kind of people that when asked to spit some bars always fall back on "I can rhyme any time."
Absolute fire
"How many times have you rewatched this?"  -YES.
I honestly don't know how I can repeat this song without getting bored can't wait for the next one already 🙂
those dislikes are from vtweeters
I can't get the hook out of my mind
But when's the rap battle against Watame? That'd be lit.
vtweeters: give advice calli: *also gives advice* dead beats; so uh where yall wanna eat..?
2:03 Your reaper just roasted all those haters on Twitter who have been starting drama over jealousy
dont mind me spamming the advertisements
とても好き
Who ever made the musical argement, needs to be fired, your voice which is the most important in your songs, is swallowed, and almost uninteligible/inaudible (I'm belingual) in 80% of the song Cali. The Chaotic would be okay, if your voice was at least the leading thing of the song to me.  Just the 2cents of that one random internet guy.
people who are mad at this song are the ones who are just waiting to be lucky.  those who doesn’t work hard , doesn’t deserve a break. take this as a suggestion and stop crying because someone’s hard work is showing.
Yup guess ill keep moving forward then, thank you.
I Need This, Give Me More
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
Mi nueva cancion favorita
いいねぇ
Uwaaaa. I'm not sure which rapper I like more anymore... Mori or Eminem.... I LOVE THEM BOTH! :D <3
i... i was not ready this is dope
Wait calliope has a nose!?
Wtf is a vtweeter? I don't get the context of the song lmao
Is she dressed as an Oiran?? bruh
fuckin sick
*Destruction 100*
They say when truth is spoken no one likes it but rather drown in their pretty little lies they created.
／(^o^)＼ﾅﾝﾃｺｯﾀｲ…八岐大蛇（ヤマタノオロチ）級の首じゃあ首ストックが足りないじゃア無いか…！
Absolute fucking banger
I'm just going to be honest, I don't love this song as I love some of your other songs, but that does not mean I can't appreciate it. Even if it's not something i'll put in my regular playlist, it's still an amazing song!
Kind of a bop ngl 😞
This is just Savage, Calli MvP
Woah. I forgot that they were Idols for a second! You go Calli!!
Mori should create a music named "cheese" about how she think is the best way to deal with all internet whining. (Because cheese go well with "wine", get it?)
so epic. and the art is amazing. kinda having dreams of seeing lady reaper in Japanese style on stream
Callie I love this song as much I love Cursed Night . U have a beautiful rapping voice
Calli you just Obliterated their non existent career's lol, Yas Queen 💀 👑  👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
me: 2 months after last video, too unmotivated to do anything Calli: start creating- me: YES MY QUEEN
this track is lit.
My favorite aspect of this song is that it's legitimately constructive criticism.  As a minor content creator, this is the sort of feedback I thrive on.  A+ song. Can't wait for the next one.
I was gonna say “shots fired”, then I realized this was less a “shots fired” scenario and more a “Battlecruiser Yamato Cannon fired at a lone Zergling” scenario. There's just nothing left.
This song gives you a fricking adrenaline it makes you feel unstoppable it makes you feel like you can take 50 bullets to the chest and walk it off like it was a small scratch
Im sensing veeery slight MASA vibes in this
Swing til the Sunrise? I'll be swingin' til the Sun dies!
RIP to anyone who had beef with Cali 😂
Omg this is fuckin lit
And now I always listen to this song before I start writing. *swings katana*
Dayum someone got buuuuuuurned
Lmao imagine being the person who sent Calli the marshmallow on advice to being a vtuber and indirectly being the trigger to the creation of this song. Butterfly effect really works its wonders and damn I wish I was that lucky person
Marine: horny ✔️
I just thought it sounded good.
when I know how u looks like, that is still cute
Does anyone else hear Kiara's "Kikiriki" at 0:02 ?
Masterpiece
HOnestly i dont follow any vtubers apart  from when they either collab with nuxtaku and gang  or drop fire songs
This song's beat n' lyrics are straight up fire, really lights up my motivation
its a dope rock.n roll beats, but i got a tear after hearing this wholesome messages from my idol,  sorry my old friend : ,anxiety, lazy and unmovitated,  its been a good time but now i need to wake up and do my works.
Ooooo por Dios. Pura calidad papá 👍😎
Most people tend to ignore the process, since to them, they can only see the results. Hence, their jealousy of someone's success. If at least they got some idea of how one could reach this point in success, they could still be jealous, but not as toxic as what's happening on Twitter. Seriously.  And when I look back at my own journey, the irony isn't lost on me, so I won't say much more.
Guess I stop whining and train harder. See you on the top.
The sheer amount of NAMES that are around the comments are absolutely amazing
Damn. People need to get off twitter
nice song-
I know there is a very possibility for you to see this but I just wanna have you know I appreciate you a lot for what you do although I don’t have money to donate remember I’ll always support you and many other people as well I love you and other people should as well they’re just jealous
Ok that was amazing, now I feel like burning trees
Hey Calliope! Your music are Amazing. Giving good advise through song and telling them the truth! Don’t let what other people said get to you! Always be you! Fun and honest! Truthfulness! Love your song too!
"Send them away Death-sensei" "No, I'm busy. Should try again next week."  Some day, Death-sensei. Some day...
Hi. I'm a skeleton o/
This *S L A P S*
welcome to the internet
"welcome to the mountaintop Where we make the bodies drop Naughty boys and girls get chopped up into diamonds , open shop" How is no one talking about this line it gave me the chills 😂
I have been listening to this song on loop for a while and I just noticed something... Is that Kiara on the background cheering at 00:01 and at random spots on song!? How did I miss that the 5k times I have listened to this song!?
My English is so poor that I can only leave messages in my native language.  我得說這沒什麼不公平的，Hololive招募的範圍是全世界，有能力才能從幾萬名申請人裡脫穎而出。 而Calli證明了她的能力，她值得那個「從10-20萬起跳」的訂閱數，要是她沒有能力，也不可能在數個月內得到一百萬訂閱。 Hater們可以閉嘴了，如果你們真的有能力，怎麼不是你來當HoloEN的一期生？顯然的，你們只是一群想紅又不願意努力的くそざこ罷了。
I type "vtweeter" on search bar and this song shows up lmaoo.
lol you need to give me 80 grand cause you burned down my house
Feel bad for not listening to this earlier. Now to go back to my unfinished projects in FL-Studio folder that's been stacked since 2017.
a perfect respons to people talking big words wile having no backbone or respect.  This one's on you Calli
I dont know who you are, which community whatsoever but, nice flow
i wont let myself get sucked into this this is dangerous for me tbh
I don’t like rap music, but this song it’s LIT 🔥!!!!!!
I just wish Cali's voice would be a bit louder :l It feels like the music is overpowering her voice and I have a hard time understanding her. But maybe that's just me ovo
FIRE NICE SONG MORI
CALLIOPE YOU'RE SO AMAZING!!🙏💘💘
Will you hold yourself accountable and rise to the fight;  Or will you play the victim and fade away?   The Song asks... Your tears answer.
I'm not good at English, but the meaning is written and I can understand what the lyrics are! Thank you! The song was so good that I wanted to listen to it again! This may look strange because I was using a translation app. sorry
i kinda wanna do some recording but i am too boomer to understeand the OBS i have 21 and i am scared of paypal stealing information don´t even have it not even twitter same with snapchat or just any shitty media thing only thing i have is facebook but i am gonna be deleting that too
understand the lyrics:0% enjoy: 100% All I know is I enjoy the song :)               and btw calli senpai if you see this comment by any chance I am one of the proofs that a kid is watching your streams.  I am under 13 XD.
So what happens when you fuse Calliope Mori with Snail’s House’s AYAKASHI?
As a non vtuber fan non weeb non fairy  Looking at the people commenting here makes me feel like a monkey inside a cage full of butterflies
あら...とうとうハムさんと作っちゃいましたか...こんなん約束されてんやん
Thats a pretty good shiet :D
Calli is only giving them good advice if people don't want to listen and get mad that shows they need to work on their mindset if they wanna succeed. To make it in any field especially an entertainment field you have to put in the work day in and out. I can only imagine the work people like calli have to put in behind the scenes not to mention the hours of streaming per week. Take her advice no matter what you do and you have a shot to succeed at whatever you do.
Apart from this masterpiece of a song, i really think this version of Cali really looks nice. Hell, we need a model for this. *With that Kitsune mask* i might add.
For those ppl who hate for getting a advice, this is prob. *a slap for you WITH KINDNESS*
The lyrics hit all the haters like a train. A masterpiece.
ok, less bad mouth, like you more
If you're mad when hearing this, congrats you fall into the useless human category
OUR QUEEN SLAYS, PERIOD
Absolutely fire. I can't stop listening.
Blood Moon Calliope ♥️
Nice singing, but I have no idea what the 'story' behind this song is. Scythe training? Reaper training?
this is terrible
i only dislike to get 666 so im sorry about my dislike and i dont know why people dont like it
Calliope Mori in Cyberpunk 2077 : D
At this point I've been told different things "You need to get your name out and network on cites like Twitter" And "You just need to make content, screw Twitter" . . . I think I'll trust Calliope on this one.
Can still listen to this song all day long.
It's not what we wanted, but it's what we needed. 🗿
Damn you sound a lot like DemonDice
Max and chad
This is like a mindset test for aspiring vtubers. If you find the lyrics insulting rather than encouraging you’re already fucked, pack it up and get a dayjob.
This Song is Gonna be written in The History's most Motivational Song
wow the details put in the vocals are incredible, this is a masterpiece
STOP STOP STOP  THEY ARE DEAD ALREADY
murdering your haters in style
That's the BANGER! Liked!
I usually am not into this genre of music, but I really like this one, especially the message in this song.
only four dislikes more till 666... we need it. Pls, help us haters. I cant, bc its to fireeee.
Mori doesn't deserve the hate. Neither do other Vtubers..
Man the lyrics hit hard..
かっこいいね～、最高!♥️
I love your music calli!!
I didn’t know people were mad until I saw it in an article somewhere... how can you hate on calli? Yeah maybe she isn’t your type of streamer but she works hard for her audience. So what? Idk. I think if you have time to hate on other streamers you have time to make your own content.
when you realize the curses aren't censored in this song....  "Expect no less Earth shaking when the Dead Beats rise"  I'll dare say we Dead Beats will try our best to not let you down, Calli! Thank you for this (TED-talk-like "educational") motivational rap :}
Yagoo's dream is finally becoming reality..
*This is drip!*
I wonder how many times I will listen to this song
Watch it a few more times to make this song break the fastest record of 10 million!
Балдежно
I never noticed the lyrics before during the premiere, but after rewatching this, they are definitely calling out someone from Twitter lmao
いえああああああ新曲だああああ
I have to say, I have not stepped much into the Vtuber community and creators, but a video by a guy talking about the controversy over this brought me to a clip of your advice and this song and between both, you got a new subscriber. That song is amazing, and if this is the kind of content you have, I look forward to seeing more. Keep up the good work and keep that scythe a swingin'!
TWITTER TURDS SALTY AS HELL
lit🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I want to play drums now
Wow this is the kind of music to be murdered by!   (props to those who got the reference ;) )
*n i c e*
This slaps way too hard and also triggers my sadism
I killed a mosquito i the coolest way possible but on one was around to see how awesome i was
calli's right, but she does need to realize how fucking difficult it is to make your own character, model, bgm and stream setup. she never had to do any of that.
この曲のおかげで自分の夢を追いかけようとちゃんと思えました。   自分より優れた人を見て、そいつのことを恨み妬み。挙句には、私が下に見てる人間を罵る事で安心感を得る。こんな日常とおさらばします。  ちゃんと努力し上のヤツらみんな刈り取ってきます。
この曲のおかげで頑張ろうって思える カリオペありがとう！
I bow to the Artist who draw this art
This is Fire🔥🔥
日本人おるかー？
Epic
Damn this goes hard
Well, it's always easy to say motivational things and all that stuff, i guess
DOPE 🔥
666 dislikes, now thats something
*CALLI STOP THEY'RE ALREADY DEAD*
I really wanna press dislike cus of 666
I love the dubstep undertone and the message great job cali!
Damn bro, I am now more motivated to work on my light novel because of this fire song
will the inst ver be released? :(
Everyone who disliked this video are the whole “I’m in this picture and don’t like it” meme
今回のtrackはAOなんだー！
imagine disliking this masterpiece. are ya mfs deaf?
So good
Welp, i just can hear the "right version" track with this type of beat
my speakers are on FIRE!           literally
Damn, this gave me chills. Not only is the production value and artstyle top tier, but the message comes through loud and clear - this is something I probably needed to hear lately.   I think many people from different walks of life could benefit from a good kick up the rear every now and then.
Nice
0:14 Sheesh that flow go hard 🔥
Deym girl~
HOOOO BOY CALLIOPE SLAYS HARD
"and here you can see a demonstration by shinigami Calliope Mori that in order to be a true angel of death you need to know how to kill in every possible way...even with just words"
Watame Juno's been really quiet lately...
yup...i need to do something with my life. Thank you Calliope Sama for reminding me
"As if these moves did not take heartache and these tracks are not fire"  Seeing from where you came to where you are, Just want to say you highly deserve it. You put a shitton of work into what you do and it shows.
"Off With Their Heads." I didn't know the Grim Reaper was French...
Top 10 people eminem was too scared to diss
Amazing voice.
As expected from Calli and AO!! The song is freaking dope!! I love this song so much aaaaaaa!!
Over a million views in just 2 day. Congratulations Calliope that's great.
There's a reason why she's called a reaper.
After VTubing for 5 months it's hard to stay motivated in an environment that's now very competitive. This song gives me the push I didn't know I needed these past few months, my motivation needs to be unwavering! I'll keep trying my best, juggling freelance, school and vtubing is a lot of work but I do it because I'm passionate!
The way she said "heartache." 2:34
Kimono Calli Costume WHEN?!?!
I enjoyed this so much that I forgot to comment, the heads are rolling.
Ok im finally a Calli simp now!
When you vs Eminem or bustha rhymes
かっこよすぎだろおい

Who agree that calli should do KING cover
Just turn on the damn captions bruh.
New song to go repeat on my playlist❤️
1:37
Calli’s ability to create imagery with her words while conveying a deeper meaning is amazing. Not just the beat or rhyme, which is also on par. Everything in this just fire. One of, if not, the best raps I’ve seen so far from Hololive. Mad respect.
anyone else realize that the mask is from kimetsu no yaiba?
Thank you for this.
え、、、カッコよすぎん？
In other words stop making excuses for your failures and work for success. It's not hololive that made calliope mori successful, it was her hard work.
AOってあのAOだよな！？
I have a question Calli... was one of your songs on dr stone?
Yeah its good Gj Cali
Its cute that shes proud of her deadbeats ngl
belt hit hard
just realized she has tattoos in the art
Hows waiting for calli x camellia ??????
I! liiiike! thiiis! soooooooong!!!!
"So whatcha gonna do about it sucker" that part gets me everytime its so good
People in the comments talk about haters, but I can't find a single hate comment O_O am I blind or somehthing
You are a Queen indeed Calli. A true Queen.
Хочу пицы(
track/mix AOさん！！
So, it's kinda funny Calli. I didn't expect this song to come along, nor the message around it. Just so happened I've been making some big decisions lately, many of which are gonna put me in a kind of situation like yours, so I was already kinda looking at how you handled it for inspiration, then this dropped a few days ago, and here we are, I'm feeling more emboldened than ever by my decision, scary as it's gonna be. Hoping to come out on the other side a better man, and I hope that you keep rising too, cuz you deserve every bit of the fame you have and maybe even more! And seriously, from the deepest depths of my heart, thank you for this fire track, I'll be coming back to it every now and again just to rekindle the flame.
Very motivational for me at least
This song has renewed my motivation. After wavering from failures, Calli's motivated me to keep at it!
DISS SO LIT GOTTA HIT SUBSCRIBE TO CHILL A BIT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
652 Vtweeters disliking this cause they can't take the truth xd
Advice like "just work hard" is hardly advice, especially when asked for one. Those that immature or delusional enough (and there really not that many as someone might portray) to not understand it from get go won't be helped by such simplistic cop-out, while those actually trying might as well feel belittled.   Just imagine, you trying to do something, something you enjoy and want to be successful at it for fame or money or both. You have a chance to ask someone already "on the mountaintop" for advice, and all you hear? "Meh, just work hard,".  Implying that someone asking, who's probably already trying, is not working hard already, that their failures and hardships are from what, lack of hard work? While also probably making those who asked think answerer either couldn't care less about them, or presuming they are lasy failures?  That's what people disliking it probably feel, and I can't understand this complete inability to get it, as well as fawning over this "incredible" insight .  Song's sound is fine.
Never heard any female rap as good as her
Two words are needed to describe this song : Dope stuff
This song must have been hard for those who only talk but can't act. I'm sure a lot of people liked this song and used it as fuel. I love your songs and this one has lit a fire in me once again.
This should've just been a diss track lmao
Some people seem to say bad things about this song,  but I know that Cali has made a lot of efforts before entering hololive, and that he is still doing his best.  So please continue to make your favorite music as you like. I love your song.  I'm using a translator because I'm not good at English, so I'm sorry if I can't understand it. From a Japanese listener.
Damn this song just hits so hard. Good timing too, since I've been losing motivation in my JP studies. Lyrics are killer, beat is killer, mixing let's me crank the volume all the way without making my ears bleed. This is straight motivation and it came at the best time.  Hell yeah
Ngl the art really fits the music style on this one 👏👏
なんか嬉しいことに日本人の私でも聴き取れた。 最高です！
NOTICE ME SENPAI !!!1!!!!!111
This is the type of content where I like, comment, subscribe, and hit the bell icon all without being reminded to do it.
This song has the same vibes as the "wannabe-"
1.3M soob
My head auto-completes "Welcome to the mountain top" as "welcome to the rice field" lol
I was hesitating to do this but, I shall do it now.       We're no strangers to love You know the rules and so do I A full commitment's what I'm thinking of You wouldn't get this from any other guy I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it Inside we both know what's been going on We know the game and we're gonna play it And if you ask me how I'm feeling Don't tell me you're too blind to see Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up) (Ooh) Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up) We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it Inside we both know what's been going on We know the game and we're gonna play it I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt...  >:D
I just witnessed verbal murder and loved every second of it.
This isnt about vtubers and the vtubing community this is a leason that applys in so many places in life take it to heart and always keep striving as ppl to me this song reminds me of the lesson i learned when i was young you gotta put in the work and effort to be better to be stronger to be the greatest to me this kind of tough love is the best real and honest great song calli
This goes so fucking hard nothing but straight heat 🔥🔥
damn this slaps harder than Keyaru's chinchin
Man this song is fire
This great to sleep too lmao Disclaimer:I’m trolling
I literally can't get enough of that chorus. 🔥🔥🔥
This is Calli's "Kamikaze". Genius!
Kiara's must be fangirling like a headless chicken to this.
AHHANAJSNZ I LOVE IT
I thought I saw zero two again 😂
日本人おるかぁ？
My pink-haired cantaloupe can't be this cool, cute, hardworking and inspiration.
I love your music. And I love this song more than any from yours as a Japanese from few reasons.  The first reason is simple, you roasted everyone’s that just claim and hate without knowing any hardship and pain in being creator, in such a incredibly creative way merged in this banger. The second reason is more came from me as Japanese. In fact that this song is extremely precise and at the same time unique fusion between all the electronics, rap, and Japanese traditional festive soundscape. As Japanese I recognize so many vocaloid musics have innovated the way fusing different genres of musics and to Japanese traditional musics and linguistics, But RAP music have been one of singing techniques and music that vocaloids haven’t been capable of contribute to.  I am deeply thankful that she, not being Japanese, contribute to fusion of traditional Japanese musics with wider musical world and innovate the way our traditional culture to contribute to the evolution of the musical culture of the world.
Out of the songs that I have heard that Calli has produced this is the one that feels the most real. She deserves every fan she has and more.   Calli, paint that mountain top red!!!
This has been on loop lately I'm obsessed
2:17 I'm quaking dawg, this beat drop is sooooooo NICE
My friend: Do u have any songs that have meaning for me? Me: no but SHE does 🙌🏼🔥
sounds like demondice 👀👀👀👀👀👀
When you know what the rapper says for once
Calli said rip and tear pog
Jajaja calli con esta canción me recordó a rené de calle 13 (ahora llamado residente)  que cuando un buen número de reguetoneros lo criticaron el hizo una canción respuesta, fue épico, idéntico a esto jajaja me encanta
“As if these moves do not take heartache and these tracks are not fire” easily the best line imo, it sums up perfectly what she’s saying. You can’t give anything less than 100% of yourself if you want your end product to be great. Honestly this song is really inspiring to me and I kinda teared up when I first listened to it, it’s a rough reminder that you need to keep pushing and working at your goals and lately I’ve been tempted to just stop putting in the work. Thank you! I’m proud to be a Deadbeat!!
Almost 1.3 million views in less than 4 days! Without counting other platforms too! This kick ass yet hopeful and motivational track really fuels the fire inside everyone! It has helped  hundreds of people, myself included.  Thank you for being you, Calli!!!
Absolutely amazing song AND its original. So glad I found out about vtubers recently
Never thought id say this but hero hei was right
I can't keep up with the lyrics so im just here vibing Keeping up the spirit til the end im still jamming
thank you cali, you revive my motivation for my future. i will continue swinging my scythe forever even i reach my own mountain top
Everytime. Without fail. Whenever this pops in the autoplay, it feels as if I’m about to run a marathon no matter how tired I previously was minutes ago.   SasuGUH, Calli Sama.
Anyone got a good deal on headphones?.......Mine melted.
Another great banger from our Queen!! Keep it up Calli-sama!
i can only say  LIIIIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
pog
I absolutely love the fact that you worked with Tophamhatkyo lol He's awesome  Awesome job!
Im just that one guy in the back Cheering on while being ignored
Truly, our queen
But Calli... you study Japanese... why would you pronounce "sakura" like that?
So twitter got mad at her because she made a banger of a song? Such a pathetic platform to be stating your opinions about Death herself
seizure warning pls;;;
I know this is focused on Vtubers but This came at the perfect time I’ve been having a rough time in my career and was almost to the point of giving up on a dream that has been 5 years in the making, but not anymore this deadbeat will fight!  Thank you for the tough love Calli! I needed it.
Dang, she's really good! I love this!💜
I want to see an gd level with that
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
A fight to sunrise against you hmm sounds like fun don't worry i will only use 000.001% of my power you are a lady after all
I'm... Honestly feeling mad listening to this. I'm not even a part of the community she's calling out, but I still am trying my own creative way of improving/making a following of my work. So this song, and the way it's lyrics are written, feel like it's targetting a very specific part of me: That self-hater who tells me not to make "X" or give up on "Y" because its not in the trend or you don't really wanna make that.   And this song is bringing out the frustration in me. But as opposed to putting me down, it brought me around. A new perspective showing itself now that someone has called it out. She's taunting me from the mountaintop, but she got there through effort and fighting every day. I'm sitting here at the foot of the mountain, envious of her view, but there are hundreds of people clawing their way up there, so how am I supposed to get to her level to prove that I'm something?  Then she calls that out as well: 1:52 and it makes me angrier, because she's right. This is how a lot of people feel. It's too relatable.   Calliope Mori, I hope you know this song angers me a lot. I hate how right you are and as easy as it is to say: I will start climbing this mountain.  Edit: OK YIKES! CALLI hearted this?! F-word. Now I can't back down or I'll look like a total poser!  2nd Edit: Wait... editing removes the heart...? FFFFFF-
You know Mori is that Vtuber than can be compared to a shounen anime mc, she never gives up and still makes content until more and more people will admire her and acknowledge  her
You can take my head, but you have to treat with love and affection~
Not on Spotify at the time of me writing this, very disappointed.
Great song!! the art style reminds me of Persona :3
Not me downloading this  on apple music and blasting it nonstop ✨
Indie vtubers: SHED BE NOTHING WITHOUT HOLOLIVE!!!  Indie vtuber: deletes tweets. I’m going off the internet for a while  Literally doing the opposite of what this song is promoting...
well.... that was great I love it   um this is..   damn so the new motivational song of the year
I really love the "dead beats, ____'n now" theme!!
This woman can't do nothing bad.  This, this fucking song is art. I love it with every molecule of my entire been.  Dear lord... Calli please, give us much more of this content, we don't deserve a goddess like you.  I love you.  —A little fan who loves you.
3:01 Sounds like a call to action Deadbeats...
Can we all agree that the visual looks crazy good 🤩🤩
Born too late to explore the world Born too early to explore the universe Born just in time to listen to heads and egos get chopped, deadbeats style.
I literally play this song on repeat when I'm working and it really helps keep me motivated I love this song so much
yep heard your songs all day, this is my favorite so far. the listener count on spotify could be a bit higher when comperade to the yt vid views.  And I realy love the beats that kokorobeats made for you. Normaly I listen the punk, metal and progressive but that stuff brings out my inner gangster <3
i dont wanna lose my head, how am i gonna see u ;(
Another bop from Calli
My house is on fire 🔥🔥🔥 🚒🚒🔥🔥🔥 .... Unfortunately, the vtweeters didn't make it out alive. All that's left is ashes. Press f to pay respects.  RIP
cant wait for this to be mapped in osu
I love vtubers
I felt her strong will. Keep sharpening the sickle without rusting it.
My first time watching it: Ok. cool...  second time watching this: *"Inspiring, Calming, Life-changing, Enjoyable, Informative, useful, Heartwarming, Other."*
NGL this made fall into the vtuber rabbit hole...
I fucking love this song so much!
0:01 kiara background ??
Wew...bloody...lass.
Dont tell anyone else but...        Calli’s my fave
Calli, your song just burn a lot of losers to their ashes, and yet your song also move those souls who now knows never give up
One word: " Insane "
imagine being mad at a swedish male just because he's just messing around with an anime model
英語ようわからんけど好き！
When I listened to this the first time it was lit. Later in the day I learned about the vtweeters thing. Let me just say, the lyrics really sinking in deep after I knew the context
Bruh, this song is amazing.
Can't get my eyes off the screen
THIS IS SUCH A FUCKING BANGING SONGGGGGG
2 lines in and Ive got chills
Over 1 million views in less than two days. I saw it get to one million last night, It was at 987k, and as soon as I refreshed, it was over one million.
Yo! Thanks for hyping up an otherwise rough work week! Keep up the awesome work!
Wasn't expecting this to be so good
"Take up the sword and swing until it is unbearable, And wear your scars with dignity when raising something shareable"  Damn, I love this line. With all the struggle we have in the world right now, I see this song not only as a "tough love" advice for the Dead Beats, the haters, or the creative community (just because some lyrics were virtual entertainment-specific). Instead, I view this as nod to all who are trying to survive in this time—regardless of profession/education/motivation levels.  Thanks, Calliope. You got me heated up enough for four lines:  Whether tis' for self-fulfillment, or simple needs for daily bites— Keep the weapons swingin', let the sowing end at Her Scythe. Switch it up, or step back and take some of those breathers; Kick it up a notch once you're back, and join the flow of dreamers!
Her songs are popping off lately
It really annoys me that there are people who only look at the success and are jealous that they cant replicate it thus retort to complaining loudly to anyone who will even remotely listen about how who they are trying to replicate is a bad person. They don't even stop to consider the amount of time, effort, energy (in terms of both emotions and the job itself being physically draining) it takes to achieve that success, what it costs the person doing it or what impact their words have on them.  Luckily, Calli is Calli so while I won't say that I think she is _entirely_ unaffected I will say, as a person looking in from the outside, something tells me I doubt it affected her progress to becoming the only Reaper than any of us actually look forward to seeing. Cant quite put my finger on what though...
I personally don't like the song but I like it's message and the art used for it
i gotta say if you’re online taking potshots at whoever you think this song “is about” instead of swinging your fwording scythe you need to listen to it again
この歌が好きなら、手を上げて下さい！
AAAH MY EARS!!! I’m a sucker for good melodies and tunes, and this track is ABSOLUTELY WONDEROUS!!!
The Huntress has a song with the same name tho I think
im just a new boi
The YouTube Captions are synced!? *WHAT!?*
This song is phenomenal, I've been listening to it constantly. The art is beautiful, I love it a lot
Your rap style is so original. Thank you for the effort you put into your work!!
These bars are dropping harder than the heads
this is a good song to be amv
You think she writes her lyrics?
Definitely my favorite track of yours so far. Instrumental is hard and unique. Your efforts really are _reaping_ their reward.
I promise I’m doing my best, Calliope-sama! Hope to make you proud someday 💕
In retrospect, it’s rather ironic how Calli’s fanbase are called the “deadbeats.”
This is a banger.
Ddue I heard the story behind all of this and instantly knew I had to sub lmao
wow, even [cc] is colorized. Also, this song be bopping.
So thought. So cool. So sweetheart. So nice.  Imo calli is waaaay more than a vtuber or a reaped at this point, and it is thanks to her determination, effort and consistency that she is where she is.  Thank you, it is a great song 😊👍
YOOOO MY HOUSE IS ON FIRE WTF
F-wording sick.
The wait was worth it!!!!!
Fuck yes.
There is literally no excuse for the TBAs to keep sitting around doing nothing. Calli gave harsh advice on this before, that this work isn't for the faint of heart. It takes a lot of effort and mental fortitude to pick yourself up and keep going at it when nobody is there to help you.   "Little miss company hire" struggled for years in obscurity and it took one lucky break for her to get the recognition she deserves but even without that break you can fucking bet she would have still been taking her chances and trying to make something of herself. When you have an important dream like hers, you don't let anything fucking stop you. It's why I started streaming to begin with. I even tried to stream when I was incredibly sick, so these TBAs don't have an excuse to not get up and get out there to at least make something.   But, you know. I'll be here fighting on the mountaintop with all the other hopefuls, wanting to grow and improve. The TBAs can yuck it up down at base camp for all I care, but the second one starts to climb up here you can bet all of us are gonna throw more rope down to help them in any way we can.
Ahh the  beat is very demonic and the rap is dicey. 10/10 great song!
I have a new favorite song
The people that like this song are the same people that say they hate rap music (Kendrick, Nipsy, etc.) and then y'all turn around and listen to this. Lmao. I love Calli and everything she does though, I'm just stating the facts though.
idk what this drama is about but this song is prtty fire
Not my type of music but damn, this is more fire than my stove top.
People saying the success from HoloLive Vtubers come because the company forgot the persons behind those avatars are persons with their own projects that put them in the sigh of HoloLive in first place. So the advice "Start creating, stop tweeting" is pretty accurate.
are you out of breath yet
Reminds me of a JT machinima song, its good. Love the beat
The ending reminds me of Billie Eilish
Amazing Job Dad im so proud of you!!!!!
I love how you tell the vtweeters to actually put in work on stream and they complain that a big vtuber is telling them how to do everything right. Then after this song dropped they played victim and still don't listen (I'm not saying all vtweeters did not take her advice and not all vtubers ignored her)
I love this. Soo good! I've been playing it on repeat!
Well, I was never a big fan of V-tubing (not for any reason in particular just never called my attention much), but... wow the disses earned my sub, time to gather the salt from the tears *lick lick* hmmm tasty salt.
By the Nine, that was intense! Another banger from the Shinigami-sensei!
smile sweet sister sadistic  surprise service  SADISTIC SAKURA
I love Kiara in the beginning xD
She better then 99% of up and coming rappers
Calli, this song is fire!
The old Demondice ~
I'm kinda smooth brain and didn't quite get the message. What's she talking about? Genuine question
REPORT IN THE FINE ARTS SECTION OF THE NEWSPAPER Regrettably, all too often, access to the public is facilitated for so-called "artists," who, being reckless agitators and imitators in the service of radical Left machinations, then have to conceal their dilettantism and their lack of ability under the shoddy pretext of an allegedly "modern trend." This time, however, we were dealing with a master who must be taken seriously and who was outstanding in his ability to interpret the ups and downs of moods in the various stages of life, an interpretation as joyful and life-affirming, friendly and outgoing, high-spirited and expressive, as it was driven by a towering sense of mission, of moving spiritual engagement, profound earnestness, purest serenity, and unparalleled inner composure. The drummer had walked through the narrow streets to gather the people. The people stood in a circle in the village square. To begin, the artist gave a small sample of his ability. He had two assistants take position and gave them a thick iron rod, whose ends they held at chest height. Then the artist went back about five steps and dashed with such suddenness and unbelievable ferocity toward the rod - no one would have thought it remotely possible - the rod was bent completely out of shape. The people were enthusiastic and applauded vigorously. The technical perfection and elegance of the artist received general admiration and lively comment. The two able assistants, without whose trustworthy steadfastness the first item on the program could not have succeeded, also deserve favorable mention. The two upright lads proved their mettle; they really have to be strong, tor the artist undoubtedly would have flung them and the rod through the audience and against the nearest house.  For the next item on the program the artist took a chain, wrapped it around his chest, and, urged on by the crescendo of the drum roll, expanded the latter in such a powerful way that - no one would have thought it possible - a link of the chain burst, the chain let go of his chest and fell rattling to the ground. The audience responded with hearty applause. Special admiration, as well as lively discussion and comment, were elicited by the sparkling vitality of the artist; it was the general consensus that he was a master in his field. For the enxt item on his program the artist took a large thick coil, fastened it to the ground, put the upper end of the coil between his teeth, and pulled on it with his teeth so tenaciously and vigorously that - no one would have thought it possible - the coil was pulled apart. The audience was thrilled, there was vigorous clapping and enthusiastic applause. General admiration, discussion, and comment were also elicited by the artist's great empathy, as well as the versatility of the repertoire he has in stock. One can do naught but proclaim: Well done, indeed! Our master, who, throughout the entire truly comprehensive program, was really in excellent form, proved completely capable of giving his wide-ranging yet solid offerings a cloak of mysticism and of manifesting transfiguration and purification so that it was obvious to all that here was a man who, because of his acquired maturity, has achieved his expertise fair and square, by hard work and unflagging industry. The high point and conclusion of the program consisted of the so-called "tightrope walk." The two able assistants, even before the start of the performance, had stretched a rope from the top of a tree across the village square, to the top of a tree standing opposite, some eight meters (!) above the ground. The artist climbed up the tree, attained the height of the rope, positioned himself properly on the rope and began, slowly and carefully putting one foot in front of the other, to cross the village square on the rope in the air (!). The tree limb on whose tip the rope was fastened was so overloaded by the weight of the artist that it broke, and the rope, with him, plummeted to the ground. The artist had at that moment been in the air above the well and our master fell from the heavens in such a way that - no one would have that it remotely possible - his back landed precisely on the crossbar of the well winch, his spinal column thus breaking exactly in the middle (!) so that his body, snapped in two, dangled over the well. The people were completely carried away, responded with enthusiastic applause, and burst into frenetic demonstrations of approval. General admiration, discussion, and comment were also elicited by the artist's quiet modesty and restrained manner. At last, once again, here was someone, who, by virtue of his noble character, his soul-sitting worldly wisdom, his exquisite and subtle humor, has no need to embrace those leftist, negativistic, modernistic tendencies which aid certain subversive elements, who, in the fateful and false guise of "art," would like nothing better than to undermine the natural order, the healthy discipline, and the simple sensitivity of our people, but they will not succeed, for we have seen once again that there were still people with  b a c k b o n e  and character, who speak to the public from the depth of their souls, whose hearts are in the right place, who know their oats, and who know what's what. It is imperative that we make mention of the fact that the artist accomplished his program entirely from memory (!), by heart, and without the use of any notes whatsoever, a singular, colossal, and absolutely phenomenal feat of memory, which stands tall and unequalled. One would hope that this performance will not remain the first and last of its kind,, but such performances will take place more often, which would go far toward broadening the horizons of our school-age youngsters, enhancing their education, stimulating and supplementing their knowledge; while at the same time, they would represent an extremely necessary factor in and vital contribution to the advancement of adult education. The performance was successfully concluded. Thanks are due the enterprising organizers without whose exemplary and flawless work this memorably choice artistic delight could not have been made possible! A big round of applause.
This is beautiful! You’ve come so far, you’re absolutely amazing!
Reee
Help me I have 3rd degree burns call 911

All of calli’s song on max volume hit different
Damn she spitting fire
Calli drips in Lin-Manuel Miranda energy
This song is her way on showing us that she wants us to act, keep moving forward, succeed and believes in us.  However, though Calli message is blunt and might even be harsh to some.  It's better to be told directly rather than it being sugar coated.  Go and reach a goal that you've always wanted to do.  Take it one step at a time, regardless of how insignificant the step may appear to be.  Regardless of the amount of times you fail, get back up and try again.  Don't just mention what you want to do, act upon them.  Who better to tell us than the hardworking reaper herself.  Live a life that you can look back and not feel any regrets, to the you of tomorrow.  The purpose of this song is to ignite a passionate blaze, so that will take action and do the things that you want to do.  It's a beautiful song with creative wordplay, meaningful and heartfelt lyrics that does it's purpose.
F wording inspirational
yea a lot of girls saw V-Tubers getting a lot of money and thought wow all I need is a cute anime face and I will get it. then get mad when they need personality and talent and hardwork to get there.  There is a reason all holo-live members are extremely talented with multiple skills and languages.
People just don't see the amount of work put in for Mori's position. She was hired out of probably hundreds of other people who wanted that role. The level of merit she has and the talent and hard work she has is far greater than any of those Vtweeting kiddos.  I am so happy I turned 18, now I can call everyone a child and a kiddo the same way they called me a child the day before yesterday.
This song reminds me of Hatsune Miku's Musunde Hiraite Rasetsu to Mukuro
"Naughty boys and girls get chopped" so no horny in the mountain top?
*Me trying to read the english lyrics :* ↗️➡️⬅️⬇️↩️➡️⬆️➡️⤴️
I really like the image that if you have an issue with Calli you can jus climb a mountain somewhere an challenge her to a duel.
Dammm!!!! Whenever i feel dismotivated i'm going to listen to this song!!!
Female Rap God, ‘nuff said.
This song made me a hardcore mori fan
this song shits on me and its good to be reminded to fucking do something rather than flap my gums.
>BIG BROTHER IS NOW WATCHING YOU... Big fan by the way!
かっこいいな〜
Putting this on repeat every time I need MORIvation
This song "hits different". Thanks Calli, I knew that if I really want something I needed to work my ass harder and harder but I was so afraid of everything, I think it's time to move forward. Thanks for give me inspiration
Hey voice is amazing
Slipping in some of the doom hunter ost sounds after "rip and tear" was a good touch.
Make this comment reach 666 likes
I can't get over how perfect this song is, such a good track
You're amazing Calli. I know more or less where this song is directed, which isn't at me, but I can still feel you kicking my ass to start getting stuff done. I'm going try my best to get out of this dark patch.
Damn, I kept getting shivers every the bass drop hard.   That's how you send a message lads. Keep them Burning Cali.
Everyone is talking about this song or the vtweeters. Meanwhile I'm still waiting & wondering when t+pazolite will remix this song
Love this song a lot
It’s Minecraft
Start kinda reminiscent of hellbento
I like this. This is my second favorite song of Calli. The 1st is "Excuse My Rudeness, But Could You Please RIP"
This really reminds me of nocando's no longer available song "Musashi Miyamoto". Same feel.
Oh My God, you looked so beautiful, my heart is going to stop!!!
Somehow that outfit screams yakuza matriarch and shinigami at the same time and I love it
Oooo okay, I see a little bit of Epik High in this style. I like this one.
so much for being on hiatus, she just murdered everyone, either from the track or the fire!
i'm seriously impressed, i'm the kinda person who hates rap with a passion but somehow calli manages to make raps that even i enjoy! Quite a lot too!
nobody: myself: stop the video and watch every comment displayed, hopefully got some material to discussed with some friend... and roast them because they are Calli's Fan  And hopefully i didn't die soon lmao 😂
Sometimes a knife in the chest feels pretty nice.
Kubi wo dase!!
This ia giving me the same vibes as the songs JT Machinima makes. The flow and everything
Hey I see a lot of improvement
Im not planning to vtube or anything, but I've always tried to do my best streaming games n entertaing people. At times its a painful and depressing path, and I've gotten so used to seeing the number 0, but I keep on going, and this song has honestly just ignited my passion for it all over again. An honest thank you from a guy who just wants to see people do what they love.
Hola webones no sé que hago aka pero bueno ni modo :^)
My hands: automatically downloaded the song
"You can't be strong if you give up from just a miss in ya streak"  Well, I mean, I kinda have to in Osu probably why im still 6 digit tho
The first time I listened to this, it was sort of like "Haha, what a nice song. It's nice!"  And then once I started paying attention to the lyrics it was sort of like "O-Oh! Uhh... Huh..."
This is an amazing motivation song as an independent Vtuber. It has brought a desire to be much better than what I am right now. I am using the words in here as a lesson to always be ambitious, having a senpai there to help me along with lessons.
What's amazing is that I'm not huge into the VTuber community. At all by a margin. But Mori is the best Rap mom ever! I love how people who think just cause they come into a field that's oversaturated is either a easy cash grab of a easy way to fame. I started my music career, have 10 songs and working on an album. You inspire me  so much more. PS. Mori is probably my all time favorite VTuber. No, this music stuff isn't easy. It's a lot to understand.
Mori : Stop talking, take actions Haters : *silent*
It's a little weird that so many people are frothing at the mouth to take a bite out of some people on Twitter that all they're commenting about is 2 lines in a song that's fire from beginning to end. Like fuck, you're the ones turning into the mob now.
What am i doing here
"THIS IS HELLFIRE!!" Literally, Freakin' dropped the mic on this one!! >:D
this slaps harder than my mom when i get a C
dude, just wanted it in the fucking spotify
AOさんやん
まさかの和風テイスト。 カッコイイしカワイイし。
This beat kinda reminds me of Mario Odyssey's Bowser's Kingdom.
Got may way (even tho idk how) into depression recently....I was so surprised when my doc said this because well, I have nothing to complain about in life. I know how lucky I am, and sometimes I feel like I don't even have the right to be sad, because there are so many people out there that don't have what I have, and yet are doing their best to get through life.    I am also the kind of person who wants everything perfect, who wants that tiny mistake to get out. I'm rarely proud of what i'm doing and sometimes I just give up because I think it's too bad to even continue. I once found an old project of mine I left and said at first : It's not bad actually. Where I remember myself just throwing it because I couldn't fix one mistake.   Now, I have to seriously get my sh*t done and get tf up cause I'm tired, tired of myself for being like this. Gimme some Calli music, max volume, and work my *ss. NOW.    Yes, people will get angry for just me existing and doing my things. Yes, they will spend maybe countless hours trying to bring me down. When THAT will happen, I know that I reached a step, in the actual good direction, and I know for sure that the battle will only just get started
Mori is my favorite for a reason🔥
I think that she could be a sekiro boss
In my opinion, this song is the best.
And this is why i love Calli, she doesn't take crud from anyone AND STILL produces great content
Dead Beats for life
1millon :o
It’s a motivational song/rap for those who’re actually trying   But for those who aren’t they’re just take it as an attack  Anyways great song Calli! OwO
0:46 2:14 These parts are so unique and badass, I can't stop listening to it
Lol I just noticed until now that Calli is dissing someone, I need to watch it 9 times to realize it. XD
Realistic, blunt, and helpful advice. If it could get an insomniac missing some sleep to wake up for this. The motivator alone for this. Just goes to show, if you want to succeed then you have to climb. It isn't fun at first, or maybe for a long time, but nothing worthwhile ever is. Thanks for the good wakeup song. It's a good listen  for someone who admittedly lacks in motivation themselves.
Call an ambulance, but not for me
Calli just prove my thought that she kinda reminds me of Akali. The cool and kinda hot person....you know
I feel bad listening to this for free
Every song you made has made has been 🔥🔥🔥🔥,don't let them get to you.
عجييييبه 🤣
When you roast Twatters so hard you get more views than subs.
Pencil and paper, the deadliest instrument of murder. This track is killer!
This song is beautiful on many levels.
Lmao this was great, if some people are offended I don't think they should really take this seriously. This song is exactly something she would do lol.
oh she's french
かっこいい…
Just gonna go grab my gas mask. Its gonna get toxic once twitter sees thia
Aight I born in the wrong one; take me to the underworld my queen
This is fire fire 🔥🔥🔥
comment for youtube
me hearing this in my biology class also me thanks calliope you made biology way more intersting
with this art and the (I think but not sure) shamisen in the refrain makes me wanna go to Japan to see the sakura blossom
🤔 👌  Edit: After listening for 5hrs my house is burning
I can now pronounce your name right
huh, sounds like demondice.....
Congrats on 1M views!
I see the Grim Reaper is taking people to task. As expected. I've been toying with the idea of becoming a VTuber but I have SO many questions and no idea where to begin. HELP ME!
100万再生おめでとう！
All like "Easy for you to say Little Miss Company Hire" As if this moves did not take heartache and tracks are not fire. As if I did not break my back over and over, I nearly expired. As if one million skeletons hit that "Subscribe" for satire.  Some one just got murdered with words.
She is the vtuber that set fire to the other vtubers carrier  Her raps songs r great
I love this song when it was released in your live stream and been looping it with your other songs/raps keep it reaping calli Deadbeat here😘😘😘
歌のお姉さん→わため ラップのお姉さん→カリオペ
This track serves as a reminder why Calli was chosen amongst the ones that applied. She doesn't need to prove herself - she's already has through whatever she did before. She worked hard for months or years to make it. The best part is that after all that effort, she walked away from it and started the whole process all over again.   While most of us have "tried", she actually did it - twice.
Is it just me or does her voice sound a lot like a Demondice? Really cool song btw <3
All the Deadbeats are ready to start swinging for dad
Sadly there aren’t enough ways to say how: good, fire, and inspired this track is.  Every word felt.  Nuff said.  Gratz for your well deserved success.
Swingin until sunrise~ YEAH DEAL WITH IT NEWWBS! (..if you wanna go to for "The Top")
やべえええええええええ！！！ 格好いい！！！！
I'm super addict to this song, and is a diss track!! SASUGA!!
So when’s the collab with The Gentle Men?
Congrats on 1million views! Well deserved!
気づいたら100万いってた。さすがです
She kinda bad tho
IDK but this song makes me think of the dog water kid  Edit: Great song btw Calli, really love it, please keep up the good work! Love from dead beat
So I asked some of these indie "Vtubers" that have yet debuted about what they think of Calli's advice. The answers I got were depressing. They all have the same pattern, either saying something like Calli got this big is because she is backed by Hololive or how a corporate's Vtuber has no right to "lecture" the indies. Then I asked them if they think that the viewers watch her because she is part of Hololive and not because they like Calli or because she worked hard for it. The result was hilarious, 2 blocked me while another gave me the crappy excuse of how viewers are dumb and only flock to big companies.
Finally, a Nightcore i could accept.
yes yes Yes YEs YES *YEEEES*
This would have a banger metal cover.
Damn
1millionおめでとうーーー！！
Hey Mori!A servant named Mori Nagayoshi want to meet you!He said you were perfect buddy for a tea party.
Brutal, you destroyed the boy without touching him :v/
These fake, trifling "V-Tubers" on Twitter needed to be put on blast for the longest time. Venomous flow, sick beats, murderous rhymes.
Luka has been really quiet since Calli started posting.
When she said Sadistic Sakura i remembered Sakura from Fate for some reason. I've seen and heard too much!!!
I dont know what's this song about but based from the comment, i conclude that this is a diss song?
I Love this song!! Good Job Calli  Thank you!
かっけぇ
Me*before this song*: ugh Im on a rut Me*after listening*:practiced bach for an hour
'Easy for you too say little miss company hire".  Oh pls, get into hololive is an achievment in itself, dont act as if there is no effort put into it.  This wasnt just some random gacha and dont dissrespect Yagoo like that, the man know whats he doing and that include in choosing the best kind of talent.
After I heard this song I want to draw the Deadbeats as Skeleton Soldiers with Scythe but the problem is that I can't draw
Now this, this is good
this is soooo good
悪くないな
A beautiful take-down of the haters!
I'm betting the dislikes are vtweeters
vtweeters: give advice calli: *gives advice* vtweeters: *autotuned baby cries*
made me subscribee
初めてこの曲を聞いた時、とても驚いた この曲にはカリのとても強い思いがこもっている あなたからも「とまらないホロライブ」を感じることが出来た！
You can tell she really Eminem since it sounds similar to what he would do and they he says things
I dunno why but this song made me think about Tomoe and Genichiro training and I think that's great. Besides that, this gave me the motivation I needed to continue writing. Thank you.
this is addicting i have more hour spend listening calliope album than most other music albums in my youtube playlists
AOtrackならリリックもっとぶっ飛んでて欲しかったけどホロライブ所属ならきびしいよな
Nice Bruce Lee reference
2:03—2:19 sick burn to those twittards Edit: i still remember those retards who said "yikes, a vtuber is begging for permission to play Persona 3! Get a life and contribute to society!" to Calli. *Oh the IRONY is real*
This do be a banger.
サムネの時点で神やろ
1 million views within 2 days lets fucking go calli
best sing youve made so far keep it up
Visit me in my funeral please
Am I the only one who doesn't have a head when listening to this song.
かっこいい
Off with it indeed
Company hire or not, this still slaps  That and her pre vtuber songs are just a work of art soooo
The song track is actually fucking insane good
This is my motivation song
Translation of what the haters are saying: "Cali's encouragement is offensive to incels and freeloaders"
why are these twittards started hating this? Calli clawed her way into getting to where she is now, sure hl did have a hand by giving her exposure but it's not as if hl is the one giving content hl only gave her a chance to be known and she took that chance and flew like a rocket
So Mori's is a music channel? Just notice instead of a check mark it's a music note.
1 listen to this song and all my WIP drawings are suddenly finished
Oooh, bloodfall
Man, this song is fire itself! Love both the beat and mean-ass bars, that's some  much-need tough love from ya.
Godamn Calli calling out fake ass creators in a track is amazing. Now, love the track. Love the voice and definitely love the lyrics. But the audio is not balanced well. And thats a first for you. It puts too much emphasis on the track and not enough on your voice. I listened to this track 5 times in a row and still couldnt make any sense of what you were saying. Had to actually watch the video and read the lyrics.  Not saying the song should be slower im saying even if its fast i want to hear you say the words and not be overshadowed by your own track. Still. Really good stuff, Little miss company hire.
2 Days 1M!!!
Probably a little late to comment but I respect you Calli, you've got fight, you've got heart, you've got the right mentality and you've got the talent and the willpower to be on this mountain top. Stay strong and keep being you Calli, you worked hard for this and you still are. You deserve all the good things that come your way, no more drinks thrown in your face. I'm happy for you and everything you've accomplished thus far and I'm excited for whatever you decide to do next. Peace! 💀
This is a reality check in a song
Nice music  Your music is verry good,calli~
You should definitely do a collab with pewdiepie.. xD
◝(⑅•ᴗ•⑅)◜..°♡ℓσνєﾟ。*♡
カリオペ×AOは強すぎる
なにこれくそかっこいい
カッコイイ💕
Wow
OwO
imagine trying to get successful without putting in any hard work whatsoever
nice
I think it's safe to say that she's reclaimed her throne.
ಠಿ_ಠ (＾∇＾)ﾉ♪
Wow over 1 Million Views after 2 days!!!!!!!
Vtuber ? Not just a  Vtuber !! Calliope is a VArtist !! Rap+Lyrics+Movie +Animation by Calliope Mori
Thank you for the added motivation :)
Hmmmmm, I just subscribed to a VTuber...
Another fantastic song for the deadbeats to rock out to
after that theres nothing that goes harder, unless she makes another song that somehow do the same thing that this one did
1 MILLION LETS GO!
Pretty bold song, but quite on point: the people who want success but not do all the painful work towards it will only feel frustration and jealousy - they only see "luck" when someone make it big, and conveniently forget about the 10,000 times that same person gave everything they could to get a single chance.  Not everyone win the lottery, but those who earn their ticket every day months after months have a much bigger chance at winning something in the long run. As far as I know Calli didn't start swinging yesterday, she went back to the salt mines for years, her current success is her long awaited harvest.  If someone truly wants to go into that business, they better starting planting seeds now and expect to starve in the first 2 years at the very least, it's a ruthless job and a risky choice that demands a huge sacrifice. If someone's not ready to do it out of passion for years, only accepting to endure it because of expected quick profits and celebrity, it's not going to work.  That's the rule for anything that involves an audience, bet it cinema, singing, music, photography, painting or even sport - most people in these sectors have another job to pay the bills and it takes years of hard work to finally get a seat at the table.   Aspiring candidates in all these sectors burn so much money on manufacturing what they think would be the best portfolio to get hired up and launched into success, missing the fact that five thousands bucks won't buy you the experience and confidence in your work that five years doing that job yourself will.
hard work doesn't guarantee success, but success requires hard work, and you can't complain about a lack of success if you aren't putting in the work in the first place.
this gots hardcore riddlebox vibes, in a very good way
5 things this song made me a damn fucking toxic in any online game i played Hahaha😅🤬!!!!  1. The song is so damn "FUCKING BEAUTIFUL!!!!"  2. The voice/ lyrics?(idk), is perfectly connected to the music   3. I feel  the madness of the song  4. Trashtalks? Hahaha yes!!  5. I feel she put her full feelings through this song.....i just don't know what it is    Just incase, if i made a mistake by my reaction i'm sorry    Just a filipino reactor of any song i listened because i respect all of those who made the songs. I just want to hear some music  Pls don't hate im sorry😓
so good song
What
That drum is really really loud. Like, distractingly loud.  Is that a steel drum?  Can we get a remix with less cowbell?
Fnaf vibes yassss
I love the song. Tough rhythms and good beat.
It's kinda funny, I recently created a channel of my own about a month ago, and this song came out like the day after I made the decision to start doubling my content output. Listening to this song honestly strengthens my convictions, and makes me want to continue pushing forward. Success doesn't come without hard work, dedication, and passion.
Being a vstreamer myself, I don’t see what the deal everyone’s going on about. I understand the grind. Getting to the top isn’t easy and this track is more of a motivator to keep pushing forward.  Update (5/2/21): I made it to the Mountaintop! I became a Twitch Affiliate last night♥️
First time: Well.. not bad. Now: I.NEED. MORE.
Moral: Even when you're going down, fall with style
DAMN, MY GIRL IS ON *FIRE* NICE!!
めちゃんこかっこよい！
1 million in 2 days WHEW
I don't know if I'm special or what but this one's flying right over my head lol
"Any advice on how to be a Vtuber?" "Work hard." "Wow that's so problematic-" ... *Fuck it. We're gatekeeping boys!*  The community needs this.
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR MY COLLECTIONS TOO😍😍😍
This song makes me feel really bad for procrastinating all day
beautiful
Motivation song I Feel like it
feels like those old fnaf songs i used to listen to as a kid.
I download this
This song gave me "fake type" vibe also if you don't know what "fake type" is I think Korean rapper?
I don't watch Vtubers, but this is badass
literally chill, thanks for ur work hard to make this song <3
This track hits harder then kiara in the usual room
I'm digging this! I like the welcome to the mountaintop part best.
1.1M soon.
I don't even like vtubers but damm miss i respect you, such a queen 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
FNAF vibes
Verry nice :)
edgy
*clears throat and proceeds to add to the collection of Calli's work I blast at max volume on my way to work.*   I require more, sensei.
I HATE RAP but holy fuck im fucking loving this!!!
Fire🔥calliope👘
Why are the twitter people angry at her for telling them to make content?
Twitter “pre debut tba vtubers”: We re gonna cancel you! Deadbeats: oh no!  Anyways...
Hot daaamn, you just seared the hypocrytical twitters with this song! RESPECT for Calli!
Actually, Calli's fire comes from the underworld so you can't heal those burns.
5/10 is really wierd to listen the song in the backgroud, but the song has more potential for rhythm games
The kinda tough love I needed to hear
My inner lesbian is happy and simping
Awesome!!!
this feel like Calli has taken some notes from Tom
meh
"When it goes down to the wire, just who survives? Are they the liars who sell their souls or those who dedicate their lives?" -Mori, Calliope (2021)  Damn, this so dope. I've been struggling recently with everything i do. But the message of this song isn't only for those Vtweeters, coz i feel like this was the push i needed. I lost my passion for music for quite a while but still pushes content even though it seems like no one's really listening. But the start is always the hardest part. Just dedicate your life in what you do and what you love Dead Beats.
Vtuber's Knows how to DROP A BEAT!!!
I think this song giving people the harsh truth they needed to hear, followed by the release stream where Cardboard Calli showed up create a nice contrast. On the one hand you have "get the fuck up and do something" On the other you have somewhat scuffed cardboard cutout being relatable to soften the blow whilst not taking away from the message that success needs effort
The best thing to do to those who are upset about you is giving them good advice because either they won't listen just because they want to prove you wrong and eventually have to face consequences and suffer from it or acknowledge you're right, change their mind and start to feel better. Then, it's their choice and either way they will get exactly what they deserve !
Why they're mad again?
*"-**_+Y E S+_**-"* I'm ready my darling
That would be her Sakura skin for the never-to-exist HoloEN x Azur Lane collab.
姉さん最高だぜ！
ive got goosebumps
The beat in this song is actually something else, it's epic
That sounds so badass
Does Ina know that, apparently Ao-chan mixes for Calli??
whoa, 2 days and 1 million already??
Good song, sorry bout all the hate.
I need Indonesia subtitle!
2 days and 1M views. Deadbeats are speed.
The only thing I'm offended about ist the fact that this song didn't come out early enough.
💕👑🔥💕👑🔥💕👑🔥
at first i didnt like the music a lot but it grew on me and now i really like
that snare goes so hard
イラストも曲も最高にカッコよくてカリオペワールド神
_Dislikes are coming from the angry VTweeters, or some people thought it was a download button_
Vtwitters and "pre-debut vtubers": *Drops hate on Calli* Calli: *is a rapper* Calli: Vtwitters and "pre-debut vtubers": *That's illegal*
like this is supossed to discourage me from being a vtuber? As if!
Ah sh*t reaper on the loose. She burned too much people Holy.
She gave them the Stunner, hell yeah!
HOW DARE YOU, mori calliope! are you saying that if people want to succeed they need to make effort? fine then, I have no other choice.I'll get inspired by your amazing art. when I feel like I'm at the end of my rope with my own drawings, I'll listen to your songs to keep my sanity from seeping away. and at the end of the day, when I feel satisfaction from pushing myself, I might even thank you... you big bully!
I swear it sounds like Kiara going "Kikkerikiii" in the first 5 seconds.
People get mad when they called out. This is a callout to our whole race....
1 million views!
Comming here for Elaina journal
let us all thank the haters for getting this video to a million views! Thank you for getting offended!
Somewhere there's  a indie tuber that uses this to drive them to put in the work and they're going to hit the big mil mark someday
'I'm not'cha "sensei"'  'simply follow my leading'  I dunno man, sounds like sensei behavior to me
....weird i thought i hear demonrice?🤔
Mori❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
2 days then got itself a million views? Damn. Btw the song is really cool
Exactly! Savage because you care. People don’t seem to understand that often enough. Thank you for using your voice to encourage everyone!!
THANK YOU!!!
Calli x corpse husband collab?!
Very impressive song 10/10 Artwork looks classy and proper 9.5/10 Animations are just boomy 9/10  All in all a excellent job i hope hits the high million views like 8million good job
The message in this song really gives out some heavy dad vibes ngl
This is great and all, but Atlus should really let Callie play Persona 3.
Это просто Ахуэнно
I thought this is Marenol from Phigros lol
love the Doom reference
This is so so soooo good!!!
Banger.......

Sudden urge to swing a Reaper Scythe is huge right now.
DOPE!
The first time I listened, I just listened to the beat and chorus and loved it. Then I listened again for the lyrics, and loved it even more.
1 million views already wtf
Damn, Calli you're really talented ❤️💀
BTW im dead now....  Feels something good
damn, chills
Im confused why is my white caption getting corrupted by the red ones
Not my style of music, but. BUT. It sounds good. I won't finish the song, won't care to listen to it again. But it has good rhythm, tempo, and the Lyrics flow well. Rap is not my thing, but, I know when a song is put well together.  Also, as a small side note after reading some comments. People don't like Calli because things are handed to her? Well that is just wrong. While she may have it slightly easier then other people will on her take off. Having the backing of a company and group to help promote and network her; she also has it a lot harder; because if she can not make expectations, she'll be dropped so fast, and well companies don't just promote for free. Wonder what sort of contract she's got. Here is hoping for good things for Calli and the rest of hololive girls, but Gura. Gura doesn't need the hope. She is their number 1 for a reason. She is actually really good at this entertaining thing and her having a company to help network her only makes her grow faster.
I made a single Garfield video please don't kill me
Truthful people wouldn't be mad at this.
Reading through the comments makes me feel like I missed some kind of event that provides necessary context for the song.
And lo, the Shinigami rose from the underworld to bring her wisdom to the mortals but there were those who denounced her and called her words false and so the Shinigami once again spoke the words of truth and burned away the unbelievers. Those who shall not heed the voice of fire shall be reduced to ash.
And down goes the VTweeters in a burned fashion.
I know atleast 10 vtubers that worked for 2 years and still only have like 5-10k subscribers and averaging 200-300 views/video yet they're still posting almost daily. Now that's a dedication
You are one of three rappers I actually enjoy listening to.
Congratulations Mori Calliope on getting 1 million views! You really deserve it all and more
Twitter is like that for a decade and some. You're rich to hell with you, you're working hard to achieve it to hell with you, you're a succesful person to hell with you.  Jealousy to the max
The fact that anyone would take offense to this just shows you believe what she's saying but just want to deny it by throwing insults instead of taking criticism to heart improving yourselves.
First song by mori i like, this song is fucking amazing
Yasuke
Next song, calli beats eminem singing faster than him jajaja
What the hell?? The lyrics, the beat, even the goddamn colored subtitles. Why is everything about this song and video so amazing?! And why is my house on fire!?!?
Oh my gosh. You massacre them with dem beats. Wow
I get why people blowing up over the important advice given to vtweeters, but the punch that gets me is the clapback to the folks who underestimate and dismiss quality just because it was made by talent who just happens to have a bit of a safety net and some advertising by association. It took blood, sweat, and tears to earn that net and those connections, and to pretend like the final product is lesser for it is pure jealousy.
If Slim Shady was a Vtuber:
This slaps harder than thanos slapping captain america
already 1mil views. I'm not even surprised. this is soo insanely good. I've had it on repeat on yt and on spotify.  also it has eeeee. 1:37

Ok, so I'm not a native English speaker but I could understand the message you wanted to give and it's awesome how you transmited such thing with an incredible song
"Talk less, do more"  Congrats for 1M views in 2 day calli
I like how she just burn them to the core.  it shakes my soul.  amitaba

you know what my first day in the rabbit hole isnt so bad afterall
Lol the lyrics are awesome ❤️. Imagine if caili heart this 😭, But it's impossible
Ok time to put this in my music loop forever
I can feel Eminem vibes in this song.
Tsk....NOICE SONG OF CALLI 👌👍
they didnt kno she actually trying to hype em all up.. but theyre too bitter to acknowledge the meaning. as usual humans like wars than peace
1million in 2days wow!!
If we are to put this on fantasy perspective:  It feels like being sent to a mountaintop dojo where Death-sensei and Calli are training students via baptism by fire, while you learn to bear its ups and down, forging your own fighting style and weapon...  ...and when she says "Dead Beat rise!", you become one of them, ready to take the challenges head-on.
I don’t really understand the lyrics or what is meant to trigger people about this song but I quite like it. I like the tin can like tone you have when you say “welcome to the mountain top”
Take me callii
As a polish person the Japanese could never defeat us, that’s why we never accepted their declaration of war
Just me: Imagining DeadBeats swinging their scythes like a pendulum, literally in a line as the background prop/dancers as if this was performed live! XD
1M in 2 days......WTF !
So again Calli has taken a genre that I never thought I'd like and made something that I don't think twice about sticking on repeat! Great work.
This song is amazing as always, it makes me want to work harder, and stop being so damn nervous to make content. Thanks cali, your songs are always inspiring one way or another. :)
It already reached 1 mil damn. I have been listening to this everyday and the speed of the no. of views is still shocking.
So many rest atop their throne, and scoff at those who won't climb the mountain. Mori DARES us to climb that mountain, but won't lend us a hand, because we'll only be made weaker by her gesture. I promise, Calli, I'll meet you there, on that mountaintop. Not on this account, and not at your own game, but I WILL meet you at that peak and shake your hand.
I love this song so much!
I love how this *entire song* is just one giant "STFU" to the very idea of looking for an "easy" road to fame.
The mask look like Kunimitsu mask from tekken7
Reminds me of those good ol' days of Diss Track by Sidemens/W2S vs KSI & Deji. XD
Another banger for the playlist! ❤🔥
damn 1 mil in 1 day
calli roast them, but what can they do? make content? lmao
Sasugah we hit a million deadbeats
Mi reinaa<3
和風ミュージックと和な衣装たまらん にしても狐の面が似合うな
DoomGuy Approves this Song message.
how can u hate her? i dont understand
Damn Cali
Fricking epic
Indipendent Vtwittes are mad in this masterpiece that it slap them so hard  (づ￣ ³￣)づ
Hell yeah!
She do be spitting bars! Lyrically great too. The beat, my God. It get me so hyped! Now, I really want to see Miss Mori ft. Eminem collab. They 100% would endlessly slays peeps up!   Thank you for this motivation song. It applies on anything we tryin to do. Keep hustlin. Never back down. Show what you're made of. Ain't going nowhere if one being lazy.   Please, take my head, Gallant Reaper. Love your work. Keep it up!
I just started not too long ago as a vtuber because I've always wanted to do it since vr chat was a thing (before vtubing was even a thing xD)   But this song doesn't bother me. I accept the challenge. :3 the ragers and haters can wither in their corners.
Aight maybe this will stop me from procrastinating
ngl when I saw "off with their heads" I thought that this was somehow related to the french revolution XD
Damn 1M views in 2 days SasuGUH dad.
Congratulations 1M views
I'm here cus I heard some are hating this, like.. are you serious?????? THIS IS DOPE THOSE RAPS DO KILL YESSSS GIRLLLLL BURRRNN EVERYTHINGGG🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ok first. Song gave me goosebumps, in a good way. Second. Who the fuck thought putting the subtitles in a new place almost at random was a good idea?
Hm, neato
1 MILLION IN ON DAY!!! Congrats to Cali for releasing a banger🎉🎉
back of reaper
The only thing I have to say about this song is.. Banger just absolute banger
Calli really is one of the few still in it for the virtual idol concept.
Hahhaha those people who dislike this is relate so hard  Because it's so lit
...and then they're taking a week off from their *hard work*
一日前 １００万回再生 「！？」
I smell something burning out there! Damn, I can already imagine the scene when she takes on the stage and the music/mood changes.
Congrats on the first of many millions to come! Let's keep swinging late into the night!
3 words.                                                      step on me
Not even 2 days and already at 1M views. SasuGUH Deadbeats!
Brutally honest advice: The song.
"Slap CERTIFIED" Fake Vtuber DISS?
Thanks for the song Calli, It really gives inspiration. Even If the fear of something not working consumes me, I must continue to keep moving. Because when you stop moving you lose for good. Thanks again, I will try to improve myself.
NO wonder those "pre-debut vtubers" are ragging at her for the song. LMAO!!! I don't watch much Vtuber content but I am glad i got this on my feed and the crying that's going on on twitter.  Keep slaying Mori, I might not be a fan but I have respect for you vtubers for the grind you all do. <3  <3
Amazing song! Thanks for all the awesome content. Keep the fire burnin' Calli!!
1 million congrats!  100万再生突破 おめでとう !  (Around 2/3 9:20 JST)( 44hr 20min )
1.000.000 soul to Queen of The Death.
i've literally had this on repeat for a full day, watching reactions videos and all but always coming back at this. loved the bruce lee be like water verse
This aint just fire It's a 5th degree burn
Lol Calli 😂 i did listen this only cuz some other creator who talks about all the VTuber drama posted it in his video description and i did want to read the lyrics
カッコいい！！
Both of this persons online personas spit nothing but Fire.
Why do I get the feeling she's about to start a brutal martial arts tournament on a private island?
F
THIS IS SO SICKKKKK YOURE SO BAD FOR THIS
"Start creating, stop tweeting" the rap waifu has spoken
Calli, please stop. They are already dead.
Most who get mad about this from what I've seen so far are either exactly who this song is referring to or an independent vtuber that streamed twice then gave up and tend to think they have more say than anyone else or both. The song from my understanding is about tough love and hardship and competition for a reason. While I am not in the industry nor do I claim to know more about it than anyone else I do firmly believe that it is tough and requires effort perhaps even more so than some things in life. (Sorry to go on about the people who dislike the song rather than how good the song is itself. Its absolutely fantastic!)
I only have my Vroid 3d model for streams and I can barely do much aside from art streams and games but honestly this song hypes me up more! I am fighting back harder, sensei! BRING ME BACK IN THE MOUNTAINTOP AND I WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT UNTIL NOTHING IS LEFT OF ME! This song is slapping and really hypes one up to work harder!  P.S Art is gorgeous. I love the eyes + Hair ♥
this refrain is crazy, i litterly can't get it out of my head
I hadn't listen to this up until now. Now I learned that I must stop playing games and slacking off to keep climbing up. Thanks Calli! This song has reignited my flame, it was the spark that I needed to keep going!
I feel this, I’ve been working towards a promotion for so long and it’s hard sometimes but nothing in life is easy and you have to fight for it. Thank you for showing that it takes scars and blood and pain to get what you want, I’ll be swinging my blade with everyone else until I get where I want to go.
Digging the beatz! Moar pls!
my head is yours
How does this song get better every time I listen to it??
I though she quit her reaping job, I guess old habits die hard
This is EPIC!!!!!!
2:39 LMFAO, SHE REALLY JUST SOLD OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SONG LIKE A MAD WOMAN AND ITS SICK AS F-WORD!
Yeah, I'm ironically subscribed and watched all your streams because you're with a company, not because you can speak a language I can understand or because you're really cool and funny (obviously joking, I love you Reaper Rapper Queen,  please rip my soul)
She made V Tweeters shatter into tears. Absolute legend.
Congratulations 1M
相変わらずかっこいいな(● ˃̶͈̀ロ˂̶͈́)੭ꠥ⁾⁾
Doesn't matter if you think this is a diss or tough love. The message of the song is actually great and to motivate low profile, inspiring/aspiring and "legitimate" pre-debut vtubers.  Oh and not only applies to vtubers but most all of Content Creator tubers in general.
Yo this song is really good 👌
Awww, Calli-chan is so sweet! She really wanted us to feel welcome on the mountaintop. 😀
Over 1M views already? Wow.
Pretty good
Ms. Calliope would you please step on me?
1MIL!
For some reason calli sounds like demon dice Karen. another female rapper youtuber. This song is straight fire doe.
Bruh 1 million in 2 days  If only Cursed Night got this traction...  Well whatever, I really hope that a decade from now the views will be in tens of millions or maybe... no...  I wont jinx it....
god dame my computer gut brunt beaus   of this
Aight Calli, you convinced me. I think I know how I'm gonna get started with this....Yeah time to get the art assets and gear to get the ball rolling and I'm looking to make an avalanche one pebble at a time if I have to.  Thank you for the motivation, seriously thank you
Nice song:)
gave  me 21p vibes
The news about this song blew the hell outta Twitter and those pre-Vtubers. XD
It took me 2 days to click on this video because I was scared I would be burned by the fire she spits. I was right to be scared
Since Calli is death, should the kimono have left or right on top?
congrats on 1 million calli you deserve it and more!!
So can we forget about the drama and vibe to the song?
1M in under 2 days
People really be hating on calli but she dont give a damnn  WHHHOOOOOO!!!! GO CALIII!!! /////
This song is gonna motivate me to clean my filthy cluttered room so I can listen to that beat on my poor buried speakers. Let's fuckin' do this!
Beautiful
I can’t stop staring at the art. Making this my wallpaper!
Tee to the hee.
JODIDAMENTE EPICOOOOOOO
Vtweeters think Hololive just picks a random person and slaps them with a model and makes them a star. Even if I'm not aiming for fame, I'm gonna take this amazing song to heart when trying to improve my own streams. No sense in whining when you can get your ass in gear.
🔥🔥🔥
This is true in life AS A WHOLE. You must put in the work. The world isn't guilty; you must do what you can do and do YOUR BEST.
This slaps🔥
Oh, I like this song *Some people are getting mad about it* Oh... Now I love it
Nice song... I enjoy it.... Gonna put it in my Playlist while drawing.... Good job reaping the "wannabe", calli
If you're angry, then this song is about you and it's entirely your fault.
Musically, lyrically, amazing. The thing I enjoy most about rap is the rapper’s wittiness, and Calli has it. And the fact that it’s laid on top of an amazing beat is icing on top. So satisfying to listening to.
Eminem has been real quiet since this dropped
People reaallly hatin on calli!!!! But she dont take no sh*tt!!  Whoooooo!!!  Go Calliope!!!
Congrats on breaking 1 million! super quick, beautiful, fire spitting queen.
So.. i got to ask, and i hope someone could reply to me because i hope i was wrong. So i don't really know what kind of people this roast really for, but i do know some "vtweeter" as the comment section said, some "vtuber" or "virtual character" who don't do much youtubing or streaming and mostly just tweet, and most of them are wonderful and really kind and really not disturb anyone. Most of them are artist too so they just do art stream like sometimes, even once a month or 3 month, and they're really cool. With that being said, I don't really get why calli had to call them out? They don't really disturb or insult anyone right? Is it about they put "vtuber" on their name? Vtuber as a deffinition is really not strict anymore anyway, it's not always for virtual youtuber but also twitch streame, and i don't see what's wrong if they choose twitter on their platform just like how they choose twitch instead of youtube? Or maybe i was wrong? Maybe this song is not for those people? I dunno i just don't feel comfortable listening to this song because that's just the vibe that i get
Congrats on 1M CALLIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  While I'm not a content creator myself, I might not be the target of this song (although this does pump me up on some personal goals) BUT, as a viewer, seeing so many smaller VTubers declaring their passion and vowing to work harder's being amazing!! So many creators to see!! For instance, I just saw a Singaporean manager of a small trio of VTubers talking about your song, how they take your message, and I'd never discovered them if not for your song firing up the entire community!!   Thank you, Dad!!! Your message came across and we're all blessed to have you here!!! Keep on swinging, we'll keep supporting you on this struggle on the Mountain Top!!!
Love this Calli you and other streamers And idols have inspired me alot and I now just wanna work 100 times harder to get out of this setup phase thank you so much for the kick in the rear
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Calli... I know you probably won’t see this, busy as you are. I just wanted you to know something. I, as a representative of this community want you to know that you are probably one of the most hardworking and determined people on this website. This song is just another example of how amazing you are.   Now, the haters on Twitter who are hating this masterpiece?  Ha.   They don’t see the pure talent in this. They don’t put their feet in your shoes. They just want to show that they have too much free time on their hands. Twitter is a dark place, and you just exposed them to what they really are. A bunch of people who think they’re better than everyone else.   Don’t let anything stop you.  Keep going.  Keep moving forward.  Love you.
Alright, deleted that last comment because it felt like it wasn't in the spirit of the song. I shouldn't be so hesitant to take Calli's words to heart. Maybe I was scared to really listen. But I think I know the answer now. I don't have any creative project sadly, but, perhaps it still applies. I've lived with something for more than 20 years, and it's been devastating. After 2 decades of fighting it with no success, I think maybe I gave up. I became so tired and it hurt to do anything. But doing nothing hurts too. So, I'll try to endure the pain and work towards something. Thank you again. Heh, you're quite a role model Calli, you know that?
3 minutes and 33 seconds of pure bars
Congrats on 1M views
Been playing it all day since it came out I may be deaf now but I listened to some sick deadbeats
I mean... for those of us who have figured out who she was on YouTube before Hololive... ya... her calling out people for wanting something without the willingness to put in the work is nothing new. So to all the people getting upset, she is saying the same stuff now she said before she ever made it big.
When I listen to this beautiful song, I imagine the actress singing it in the studio. And at the same time I feel sad, because I will never see this talent in reality ...
540 "pre-debut" vtweeter don't like it
0:38   Only our Reaper can make something like a cat meow sound this lit
Congrats on 1M Views Calli❤️
Calli: "Wanna see me speed run a million views?"  LMAO Congrats!!!
Read the desc guys-   It's just a song-     Sorry if I said something wrong-
MILLY HIT!!!YEAH
Everyone's calling it a diss track while I'm calling it my song on repeat for the next few months
I dont really follow vtuber drama so i didn't understand any of this. The comments are saying something about this song dissing on vtweeters? Can somebody explain to me what's going on 😅
Grats on the 1m yo

Congratulations on 1 million views!!
Sometimes we have to teach people the hard way...
My PC turned off after listening to this.  It died with honor.

‎ ‎

Imagine getting angry at a song that pretty much describes your procastination and love to blame others for it. Now this is my second favorite Mori song
Did amazing once again, Calli, <3
*HOW DARE YOU SAY I SHOUD **_WORK_** IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING?* ---- _V-Twitters_

I don't often watch Calli but damn this a good song
100万 おめでとう🎉🎉
This is fucking sick
There are two kind of people One who gets provoked and getting angry and starts cancelling everything that's not about them, or One who gets provoked and started doing their reps to be better, still do their best, respect their provocateur, and make the best of themselves
1 Million!  Congrats Calli! :D
this is such an awesome song I can tell a lot of heart and soul was put into this and it really payed off
1 MIL LET’S GOOOOOO!!!
Congrats on 1 Million views!
1 Million!!!! Congrats Calli
It is going to reach 1M yoooo
This song proves that Calli's music gets better every time a new song comes out. Good work, Calli
Kazoo remix when?
1 million views!!!!!
I think its interesting that rap has fractured into different cultures due to the fundamental differences between languages
certified banger
Damm this song is great
i have no idea about all the drame but this kinda bops
yo
Reaching 1M views 44 hours after release. 44! That's such an in character number it was just meant to be.
This song almost inspires me to make my own content. Then again, that was the plan for later this year anyway.  (Different account, not this one)
Its just me or the art on the video feels it came from persona game?
This is the push i needed to keep drawing, thank you
god how can one person pog to such an unimaginable level
WHY AM I BURNING, OH WAIT THIS IS FIRE
Time to listen to this on loop for the next 3 months 🧎‍♀️
but for real tho, enka when calli?
It's not 1M views yet but CONGRATS ON 1M VIEWS EDIT: HELL YEAH 1MIL, LET'S GOOOOO Keep slaying.
Does anyone wanna swing a sword
What is this?! Music to be murdered by vtuber version?  😦
She didn't just throw shade, she threw the whole damn tree 🔥
Is she going to post this is SoundCloud as well?
She kinda sounds like Demondice, either way still love the songs.
You. I guess big dude saw Mori's love, and gifted her with hate to all vegetables. Thrilling and amusingly admirable, and venturing song. That's Lit keep up "Ding dong" good job "Kawaki"
i've got no words for it except that i love it
Made get my semi-fat ass back into drawing. Thanks.
One of the best disstrack ever.
I heard some "Vtweeters" were upset about this, great job daddy Calli!
FINALLY, ANOTHER SONG
おお… なんと美しい…
Anyone else getting vibes of " the tailor shop of enbizaka"?
I listened to this and liked the difference between her songs and I thought Demon Slayer the whole time
Here before 1 million views! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
In regards to the jealousy and comments of "Being handed the job", even if Cali was handed the bat, never forget that she made the swing and got the home run, not everyone can do that part.
Im not much of a rap guy but Her music is growing on me. & I love it!!
Okay, wait a sec, why people saying She "Silenced" the Indie VTubers? She literally gave a command the exact opposite of "SIlence!"
I love the art here. It is like a cross between Calli, Wagaki Band, and Baby Metal.
Woah there reaper lady , you only have to kill them not send their souls into the abyss XD Pure Genius
With every passing day we sink deeper into this stagnant bog of degeneracy.
Amazing, need I say more.
"You can't be strong if you give up from just a miss in ya streak"  Wow. This line hit me hard, because I'm someone who dwells on my mistakes for way too long, to the point that I drive myself into an unmotivated, depressed rut. While introspection is good for the soul, giving up after realizing your flaws is not the right answer, but like a lot of things worth doing it's easier said than done. Hearing these words from someone I can visibly see is such a dedicated and hard worker is seriously motivating, so I really must thank you for releasing such a motivational banger of a song. Time to stop feeling sorry for myself and get back to the grind that is life.
I’m not sure how to feel about this song. It feels very much like the “pull yourself up by your bootstraps mentality” you hear so often. It’s really not that simple in life though, there are inarguably things outside your control in life. Shitty bosses, disabilities,  debt. And for some of us the stress from just trying to survive is too much to do anything else. When you have to worry about your bills and if your gonna have a panic attack at work, it’s hard to do things that also stress you out in your free time.
Holy
She be cutting more heads with one song than the whole French revolution did
カリオペ様！カリオペ様！
英語のラップなのにトップハムハット狂っぽさあってすげぇ
Such a kick ass beat to reap some souls to.
thank you calli (cali? callie? how's it spelled?) i'm new to your channel but this song genuinely motivated me
Honestly this made me subscribe because you keep it real and dont pull back any punches, this was and is a wake up call for many others aside from vtweeters. Me included, ive been complacent my entire life, not bothered to improve myself as a person because I think you had to be special to be special. This just slapped me silly and kinda showed me that I really need to pick up the pace with whatever I choose
Twitter watch out! You might get burned into ashes buddy.
ngl this is actually fire
"Simply follow my leading", yes dad 👀
I really am not a fan of hololive. But Calliopes songs are goddamn fire Also i agree with her, alot of these twitter vtubers are annoying af.
So did something happen to cause this diss rap?   Other wise it seems sort of petty for somebody who's made it pretty big to launch an attack on a bunch of nobodies and never will be-ies.  I mean the rap itself was really good, it just seemed rather mean spirited unless there is more to the story behind it.  If there is more, are there links to what caused it?
*intense recorder noises*
how do i free robux? please i need free robux!!
Yikes, you killed them, unless they already dead.
Mori: pops off* Me: thats an awfully hot coffee pot
Woah...
I just love that all this outrage comes from someone trying gradually coax others to put in the work. If you're upset with someone wanting you to do work, to improve. It's because you don't want to do the work. And you don't believe you have to improve. And that mindset is pretty god damn childish.   She isn't saying that she's so far above and better than you. It's a challenge of sorts. Do more, improve and bring it, succeed and come at her. Or just sit the fuck down. It isn't meant to be easy, who said it would be? She believes you can do it, make it through the strife she did.
The ultimate "get rekt, git gud"
how are the subtitles doing that
This is great lyrically I just wish it had a more traditional "boom bap" beat. The electronic production is a little noisy and all over. Keep up the great work!
Seriously Altus, let this gal stream Persona 3 already.
Sounds a lot more animated than stream highlights
Holy Smokes.!
Typical flow lol. Corny
Pog this is trending in U.S
519 vtubers are mad
"If you want to be a professional, first you need to have STANDARDS: Be polite, Be efficient, and have a plan to -kill everyone you meet- create engaging content to carve a name for yourself" Mori calliope, probably... and a australian sniper.
song is lit
I actually listened to it when it came out but only now have i been able to put together a comment,even if no one sees it,i come back listening to this a lot and everytime i listen to i just wanna do stuff,practice drums,write that story i thought up,put more effort into language learning,work for money to upgrade my pc so i might be able to stream one day,spend time on things i could care less but have to get over to do what i enjoy,i'm still not sure about what i wanna do in my life but whatever comes i'm gonna work for what i think is best(if only i wasn't so lazy i would be so much more productive) because i know what i want i can,it's all in attitude
People getting upset completely miss the point of just do the thing. It’s structured like a diss track but it’s contents aren’t malicious, because that’s not the intent and authorial intent is very important and must not be lost on people
tweetuber is so cancrous
God bless. I hope you all know God loves you. And it says For God so loved the world he sent his only begotten so, For whoever believes in him shall not perish. God loves us that he sent his son, fully knowing what would happen to him. So that we could be washed of all our sins. For whoever believes in their heart and confesses with their mouth that Jesus Christ rose from the dead after three days, shall not perish but have eternal life. Jesus took our sins no matter how bad. And if we believe we have our salvation. But that doesn’t mean we only believe, no, we put in the work, we read our bibles, pray everyday, follow all the commandments listed out, especially Love God with all your heart, mind, body and soul, and love thy neighbor as thy self. God wants us to walk a righteous live and holy life like Jesus did, walk a life like Jesus did, but we can’t do it alone, for what is impossible for man is possible for God, so the Holy Spirit fills us and we live a life like Jesus did. Repent of sin, ask for forgiveness, and stay away from sin. God bless and have a great day. I ask that you please stay away from demonic things, that could infect your mind or cause you to sin, to stay away from demons, lust, greed, pride, selfishness. Envy, gluttony. And all sins avoid stealing. But instead help life each other up, and hope to see others succeed, serve others and wish each other the best:). God bless everyone and I hope you all have a great day.
I believe the title of this video is mislabeled. I believe a proper name would be Vtuber Disstrack.
Oh no another song to rap when I'm on Discord with my bf and throw him off
Motivation: *Acquired*
Awesome song....and I don't usually enjoy rap. You can hear the amount of work she does. You can see the work she does... Get out of your tweets or get out of this game.
A couple of days have passed since this song has been released, and the more I reflect on the lyrics I feel more excited for the future. Entertainment is not my career interest (I studied Finance and Administration) but I can feel that the song can be applied for a lot of paths in life. I still remember your story when you worked so hard in that restorant chain to go to Japan. I hope in the future I can be an example for others in my country, like you are an example to me. I wish you the best.
I have this on loop while I'm writing. Listening to the lyrics and the sick beats have certainly helped me get over my writer's block and personal hang-ups about my work. Thank you so much for this amazing song. Much love to ya Calli. Keep being simply amazing as always.
A beautiful rap about how giving up and excuses get you nowhere and you need to shed sweat, tears and blood and work on yourself to get anywhere, while also telling us about the feeling of satisfaction that working on yourself will bring.  And it is also addressed directly to her following (the Dead Beats) and encouraging them to go the extra mile and how Calli believes that they can do great things. Beautiful.
Tupac been MAD quiet since this dropped...
Another great song by mori, and jesus you destroyed the 90% of users on twitter with that flow
I don't know what the other people in the comments are talking about I just got excited she made a new song and I love it
Idol?
If you're mad at this song the song is directed towards you
God damn.
Oi the fact this is trending is sick
Yeah, I'm now permanently scared of calli
This is about to reach 1M in only 2 days, Congrats, Calli!!!!! (let me do my part feeding Algorithm-chan with 1 more comment)  People are feeling attacked, but this is only a defense. Dad was just trying to do her best, but that was too much to handle and they had to talk sh!t about her. If only they had listen to Dad telling her story they'd know that the Fs were plenty along the way, way more than the wins.  1 year of hard work before becoming big? 2 years? 4? 6, 10? Unfortunately even if you do your best and hone your skills everyday it isn't guaranteed to succeed. You also gotta work on your publicity, learn how, when and where to show your craft. People need to see what you're doing, and most importantly, they need to want to come back. That's when the backlog of content produced and your build up talent comes, that's why you should get down to work sooner rather than later, to grab the opportunity when it comes. Publicity alone can only give you 15 minutes of fame, unless you become a master of going viral (which in itself is a hard enough skill to develop), after that you'll be forgotten. And if you quit when you're low or haven't even started, then that's all you'll ever have.  Keep on swinging, Calli!! There's always a bigger mountain to climb, it'll be hard and require a lot of work, but it'll be fun to follow and support you on this journey!!
Applebees laid a huge foundation.
*Off with their fucking heads!*
Herohei referenced one line in this song. I was not expecting straight bars throughout. 🤩🔥🔥🔥
good job calli for this banger song! this gives me the fuel to try harder at university - thank you
Back for my daily rewatch
Thanks for the advice, dad
Thats sick, bro.... Breathtaking!
Nobody is talking about how godly that art is.
The lines " 'Easy for you too say little miss company hire' As if these moves did not take heartache and these tracks are not fire" really resonated with me since I get people saying stuff along the lines of that to me because I was quickly promoted into a higher position at work shortly after I was hired and people only see that part. Not the blood sweat and tears I had to put into to get that position. People always going to hate but all 1 million of us Dead Beats support the every living f-word out of you Calli ♥️
Yooo this is really freakin good !
Okay you and demondice sound so similar i love it
Good stuff cali
*i love this-*
I find myself coming back to listen to this before studying or just after taking a small break. Gets me in the right mind set and fired up to put in the effort. Quality content Calli. 10/10
I usually don't listen to rap, but yours is just too good ☠️
This song has been out a day and it's already stuck in my head.
just like em, i love you
I havent listen to much vtuber songs but this one is lit
This music gives me a Great Milenko vibe, just less horror.
The Eminem of Death
I like the song, though I'm a little disappointed by the vocals. I can't quite put my finger on it, but they somehow feel too similar to your previous work and I don't think I like that.
>create content instead of tweeting literally how is this anything but good advice?  If y'all are tweeting instead of creating, you're not a 'VTuber'. Just a dude with an anime avatar on twitter lmao
I feel like entertainers who get upset over being called out for not providing any entertainment would have a hard time in such an industry anyways
Reminds me of James Franco's line in the Movie The interview "Hate us cus they ain't us".
I wish I could like this song again. every time I rewatch it I just wanna like it again it's so good.
everyone really gonna ignore the doom reference at 1:12
Listening to the words. I'm pretty sure she wrote this after the Twitter drama.  She sounds so angry
I can't believe you would do something like this          Getting a song stuck in my head you are awful
This sounds like prime training material
ooohh yeahh lit asf shots fired
I remember during Calli’s debut when she showed Excuse me but could you RIP? she said she wasn’t sure if we weren’t gonna like the song. Now Calli is out here with “as if these tracks are not fire” like hell ya keep up the confidence because these tracks are most certainly fire
you just love making my house catch on fire, don't you?🔥🔥
How do you do it? It just keeps getting better and better. Definitely my new favorite by you
To be completely honest, the people getting mad at this are the people who needed the advice.
What a way to swing the scythe.
This is the Future hololive IDOL. Please Yagoo, your dream not stop here. Look it that. You have any good member tho. Don't stop your dream to make an Idol Group. I support you. Please Yagoo aka tanigox
"Then start creating stop tweeting" best line ever.
I dont even like hip-hop or rap but this actually gave me goosebumps.
This song is lit 🔥 and makes me want to check her streams.
You've done it again! A brilliant song!
Tbh the only people who get offended by this are those who know they fit the description. Its always like that. No names were dropped yet they felt like its a personal attack to them, and thats how ego's work.
CHILLS!!!!
this song is SICK!!!!
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🔻
Damn, that flow at the start was insane. Wtf.
nice kimono
These past two years I have lost lots of motivation to do much of anything, online university, not being around those I care about, and losing interest in trying to work hard. This song is exactly what I needed, you bet I will be playing these words over and over in my head; "They spot the name, the fame, start shaming, raising their brows. All like, "Easy for you to say, Little Miss Company Hire." As if these moves did not take heartache and these tracks are not fire! As if this back did not break over and over? I near expired......Take up the sword and swing until it is unbearable and wear your scars with dignity" This song put a fire in me, and you bet I will let it burn until I run out of fuel to keep it lit!
Song hits harder than primal bahamuts teraflare
stop making argument and if you want to start vtubing go calli gave you advice and its your choice how to move dont go and attack calli WTF is wrong with people now a days calli made this distrack cos people made her advice in a bad way who doesn't get irritated by that she gave you a concrete advice and now trying to attack her enough making "even indie vtubers are doing their best" don't include  the other indies that already doing great in their career with the wannabe because of that the people making so called community will destroy the other vtuber who's doing what they love. if you didnt agree with her advice THEN IGNORE IT DONT GET OFFENDED!!!
Twitter Is The Most Cancerous Apps Where Some 14 Yrs old girl or boy went start a damn fight and be retarded for no reason.
"Calli energy" and "dude, fuck off" energy are siblings and I just want to take a moment to say that I deeply appreciate and love that.  The Reaper is fair and patient, but don't step on that patience.
I love the tough love!!! Ah putting this on repeat
lalalala HEY! Didn't see you there! hey while you're here you oughtta subscribe to Little Movie Productions!!!!! OR ELSE
this song is really a banger ngl
ふつくしい・・・
Wow!! This is FIRE!!! Calli be spittin some straight facts doe
I notice that more I listen to it, the more scary it gets. I think I hear slashing and people in the background at certain parts. Powerful song I love it.
Here before 1 Mil?
Feels like listening to my dad. Tough love indeed.
Honestly I didn’t know you could do that thing with the subtitles lol
Wow
Damn, almost only 2 days, and she already almost at a million views, and she's trending

This is to all them creative homies, we hate the slackers!! ✨✨✨✨💞💞
Get Really resonate with this one Thank you calli
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.

This motivates me even more to get through with school and start my vtuber over the summer !! Idk why people are so offended? This should be inspiring tbh
RIP AND TEAR
v tweeters got a taste of her old job
AH KYUUBI
pog
Pre-debut vtubers crying on twitter  Callie: it free real estate 😁
this is actually good
Yea this beat absolutely rocks and the lines might be some of the best you've laid down so far. Really great work of everyone involved. Tough love Calliope ftw
epic
Calli just got away with straight up lyrical murder on youtube.
I like the song, but the video should photo seizure warnings on it. The flashes can trigger seizures.
where's the casualty count? I wanna see how many souls she reaped.
So thats how a real reaper reapt
how come some will take offense in this nice song? am i numb?. btw great song from our sasuga reaper 😈
I need this to wallpaper,
As a pre-debut, I don't get why there are people hating on Mori when she deserves to be respected for the effort, the hardwork and love that she put into her work. What Mori is now is a result of her advice. She spoke through her experience and yet there are people who is so blinded by their jealousy that they could not even think straight.  This kinda reminds me of a story that I read when I was a kid. The story of "Juan tamad" or in English "John the Lazy". These vtweeters are like Juan Tamad. The story basically goes like this... Juan Tamad saw a fruit hanging on a tree, he wanted to eat it but he is too lazy to climb the tree. What he did was to lay down under the fruit and wait for it to fall down to his mouth. Months pass and the fruit still won't fall down but he didn't move, he stayed there lying down. He died but the fruit didn't fell not until a bird ate most of it and the scraps fell down. Some left overs fell but he's already dead. Climbing the tree wouldn't even be considered hard. The tree is not even that tall so he can even reach the fruit simply by jumping and extending his arm. He was too lazy to do all those work though.  *_Start of Edit_* Main point is, not everything is  served hot in a silver platter. Success do not just fall down the sky. We need failure after failure, hardwork after hardwork to build stairs with a steady foundation. Everyone needs to learn first how to crawl before learning how to walk then later run. So you peeps need to do your work first. Learn how to walk. Learn how to run. Only after learning how to run can we race to the finish line. Mori is waiting for you at the starting line. Work your ass up and get in the starting line before you start to bicker what cannot be said and who should say what should be said. To end this all. Let's quote Mori! "Start creating stop tweeting" - Calliope Mori.  P.S. Well my english might be weird to others or others might not understand what I'm saying and I am sorry about that. English isn't my native language. I consider myself fluent enough though. As long as there are people who can understand it is communication. Anyway, let's all work hard together! *_End of Edit_*  Thank you Mori for this inspirational song! ♡♡♡
This song slaps 👌🏻
Absolute banger Calli.     I’m gonna go back to working out this has motivated me so much.    I put on so much weight over Christmas and I think it’s time I get some abs.     Have a good one.    Great work and I’ll be on the comments of your next song       Enjoy yourself and work hard calli. I appreciate the song and the motivation along with it!
夜をかけるのノリで首をはねるなよ！
💜👍🔥
Mori is on trending!! Such an awesome song. The music was fire, the roast was devastatingly perfect, the music was over the top. Congrats Mori!!!
Лучшие за этот год)
Really good, and catchy. Not saying it's the intent, but I found the lyrics pretty satirical of the whole social media scene.
jeez this is insane
Absolutely loved it.
The force is strong in this one
"I'll gladly live inside your head but who the fuck pays my rent?" Well... as a real estate agent, rent free are not words I like but... I could bring myself to use if you catch my meaning.
Absolute fire, pretty much the Vtuber song version of "You miss every shot you don't take". Content creation isn't nearly as laid back as some people may like to think, my past self included.
I really love Calli's perfect english
Damn that was fucking amazing
how tf did she do that with the captions, never seen it before it's so cool lmao
Fuckin' Based
Rappers that Eminem does not want to mess with
damn my death god is really too good at rapping!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love this. Omfg.
I don't like rap. But this is good stuff.
*slowly cuts off head*
The eminem of the underworld strikes again.
This song really make fire light in my spirit
Perfect for a Geometry Dash level
Twitter's fucking mad right now.
The rhyme schemes and delivery... 10/10
Dang you had to spell it out
A Banger indeed
Sweet Sick Savage Sadistic Super Shinigami Style.  Love Calli.
.
It got nearly a million views after one day. And it even deserves more.
This is like the best song i have heard from a "content creator"
Vtweeter do be shidding themself cuz they cant handle da Fire that Mori just drop
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Came for the drama.  Stayed for the 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"I'll gladly live inside ya head but who the fuck pays my rent?"   It's rent free, Calli, it's rent free
after reaching a level of "success" at which i make enough money to pay the bills i feel like I've started to give up on making new big things the way i used to, especially throughout 2020. I listened to this on repeat and blew through some lineart thats been on the backburner for months. This song is genuinely so motivational. THANK YOU CALLI.
Let's goooooooooooooooo  #36 Trending
wow, didn't knew that a vtuber can make music soooooo good
The beat sounds a bit like Fresh Prince of Bel Air ..... xD
That flow was amazing, subbed
this song is fire also twitter is mad so makes it ten times better
OMG WHY ARE THE SUBTITLES PINK :0 I LOVE IT!
So this is her "Kamikaze" but instead of bombing she's harvesting the fields.
ayo now im feeling it lessgo
A poigniant message with a purpose behind a solid beat and lyrical prowess.  This is what Rap is.
the more I listen to it, the better it sounds, and the more I want to listen to it. It’s so addictive
Every line callie spits is fire hot enough to burn a phoenix
Yo Calli this song is really awesome and love the picture of you.
When she says "Welcome to the mountain top" with that grit it does things to my soul.
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
【Loop On】
I have decided to play this to start my uni work sessions off with.  Calli’s lyrics trigger my fight or flight and hecking motivate me so I can be worthy fhrjjdjdjs
Y'all hearing Sekiro noises here or is it just me?
またかっこいい曲が上がったぞ...
last 100K to 1M? That's insane, sasuga the Grim Reaper!!
this song is so fire that the flame of Olympus got jealous
Love this song
why do i fall in love with pink haired girls like ZeroTwo,Calliope,...
this gives me so much hope and encouragement to continue working and not giving up
Bang.
this is lit
Big time similar sound to some demon dice songs...
I debuted a little under two months ago. I have been streaming almost every day, sometimes twice a day. I've been putting in work but this song still kicked me in the face. There is so much more I can do. I can swing the scythe even harder. I made a game plan today on what I need to do and what I can do to get better. I will be back to this song every time I start slacking until I'm always swinging that scythe as hard as I can.
Where is this trending?
Noice. I can understand her lyrics not like other rappers who just mumbles their fcking lyrics. 🔥 🔥🔥
Early.
Mori is yagoo idol dream in different ways 👌
spotify?
Bruh
Oh boiz! This is so EPIC
After knowing this song's meaning, I loved it even more
Ok
Mori: "Create, don't just tweet" Vtweeters: *angrily tweet* Mori: *creates song to show them how it's done*
I know this is not your first time -probably someone in future commenting this
Suckerz!

this is actually really cool!!

Twitters mad at it so you’re doing something right.
when you say "mountaintop" i know your talking about a metaphorical mountaintop but all i can think of is "haha pocket rocket launcher Pepega"
that beat is banger!!
This... is pog
I want to marry death. Dude, am i crazy or what
I'm so proud of our dad
I feel kinda bad for the jp bros who cant speak english well enough to understand the situation which led to this song. Same goes for the lyrics of the song - yeah, It's also written jn jp but thats not enough to convey the fine nuances.   At first I didnt really like this song because i didnt know anything... Later I listened to the lyrics closely and Fell in love - thanks calli!
Lower the background music, I prefer to hear voice more than the bg music.
Great song, i really love the message behind it No one can get something without doing nothing and just talking (or tweeting in that context). Thanks Mori for this hard but true advice
☠️👍
thanks AO, the beat is sick
Great job calliope keep the Japanese instruments in your raps and you are my favorite hololive vtuber
Bro cold war about to drop the new firebaseZ  couldn't find anything else to comment about
Hololive is on the rise this year!
Well. I can certainly jam out to this
When people get mad at this, Calli has achieved the Eminem flavor. Subtly and also directly dissing people who tried to hate on her for just... existing.
my heads and soul are for you Calli Queen
Calli has been lying to us this entire time...      She keeps saying that she's on break from reaping but the body count says otherwise.
This is straight fire!
I want heavier :3 deathstep heavy >:3
Best Mori Calliope song yet!
サムネがサイコー
Those dislikes are from  self proclaimed vtubers that are so busy arguing on twitter but can't even bring content consistently  Nice song tho!
Now this is what we call a Banger
I hear the summons. Rise... slay... collect these salty Vtweeters tears.
C'mon everyone, we can get to 1M!!!!
這死神也太美了ㄅ
かっここいい
Just an opinion; the song can be one of the tracks for a cyberpunk~ish game
As an idealistic dreamer myself, this song made me realise that fighting to get where I want to be won’t make it easier even in the long run and it all isn’t worth it if you don’t have the talent known as ‘enjoying hard work’.
Yo I listened to this song more than 20 times already....  *Presses replay*....
気持ちええ〜〜
Beautiful song. And its truthful. You can't give up people. And yea she works for hololive, but hololive wouldn't be so popular if they didn't work for it. That's how competition works.  It's the same in a video game, you have to work hard to get on the competitive level of esports. And you cant just quit after 1 failed match. You have to keep going.  I run this way in a mobile gacha game and guess what, I'm still running.   On a side note, due to that mobile game I have become very fond of scythe users. They tend to be very, op.  Mori, if there was ever a collab between hololive and Honkai impact 3rd, I wouldn't be mad if I had another Scythe user.
I don't follow any musicians because music has never interested me enough to do so. I think that changes today though, as I've loved every song you've released so far. Really excited for your next track and I'm really going to have to resist the temptation to listen to your current ones on repeat. Don't want to ruin them for myself.
I keep hearing another vocal in the background, is that Kiara?
I love her  that's all I got to say
Vtweeters: And I took that personally
Believe me when I say, even for my trade, this advice still applies.
I got hooked instantly. Great song and I love it
after listening twice i actually like this song and the lyrics hits harder....  anyone feels like that too?
When going polite fails; time to get the gloves off.  Also perhaps this song is also the push I need to continue on instead of quitting due to irl circumstances.
Calli: "Make content" Vtweeters: "no!" 😡 Calli: *Proceed to make content about it*
if eminem was an anime girl
Thanks to whoever did the CCs.
1:12 *Calli:* [says "REAP and tear"]  *Doom fans:* [grabs shotgun]  ...until it is done
Absolute truth. Gotta put that passion into action or it'll just burn out.
I don't have a DAB EMOTE if I did my comment would be just that ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Calli had my curiosity but now she has my attention 😂
Fire
Love the message. Love the delivery of it even more.

Each song gets better. Finally have a beat that is a perfect match for your voice. This and Cursed Night are both my favorites because they just have that nice blend of your voice and the background instrumentals
God fucking damn

Its probably just me but the music remind me of The Living Tombstone
I love this
最高すぎる……。
This song is so fire that my hair is burning now. Like, permanantly.
How
I've come to hate rap over many years of being exposed to only bullsh*t. Now Mori releases 1 Track that's absolute fire and Rap just might be my favorite genre now
I don't even understand this vtweeter nonsense, I just like it cause it's a nice motivational song for creatives
Why are the yt CC so cool
Perfect workout song 🔥
Is it just me or does Mori looks like 02 from Darling in The FranXX in this image?
When she said "Rip and Tear", Doom Slayer felt that
I didn't know anything about Vtubers, just found this today randomly in the trending page and this song is lit af🔥🔥
That's what one and only mori do👍💚 💙💜
loving Calli's songs more and more ♥♥♥ i'm cheering for you Calli ♥♥♥♥
I thought this song was gonna be epic, but it was so hot it left burn marks on Twitter.
She sounds like DEMONDICE
God damn calli wanted send a message to her viewers and damn did she do it well
なんだこれ！？ かっこよすぎるだろ！
天才かな....
Hey hey death goddess  You're not supposed to deliberately send them to the other side.
I dont think people are really mad at calli for this i think they are really mad at themselves for realizing the lyrics are so true. For me the lyrics are a double edged sword there is  so much emotion behind the song that I have a hard time listening to it casualy without getting worked up 😭
"Are u a slave? An entertainer till the fun dies" oof, she fking murdered them, brought them back to life only to do it again
Thank you Calli, you've lit a fire under me and I'm ready to blast off.
わかんないけどめちゃかっこいい
As a man who just enjoys watching VTuber clips, and is poor, I just laughed, cause we know where is this directed... XD
Its hard to explain how this song makes me feel. So I'll use emoji's 🤨🎶😯😌😐😳😤😡😥😢😭🤧
ENver.のKingかな？
Kind of got a point stop complaining and keep trying if it does not work then I does just don't give up quickly
皆さんが探している日本語のコメントはこちらです
I came here only for the subtitle i never seen that kind before
Stop barking start acting
Calli is living in my head and I'm the one who pays for the rent
The beat is holding her fire back
Step on me my queen
The rap charge to vtweeter be like: Banzaaaaaaaaii!!!
Hey you what you doing?
FUCKING FIRE
AMAZING
This is Fire straight out of hell🔥
To all those who think they can tweet away their problems, consider this your wake up slap. You will only get out what you put in people, and for F sake don’t compare yourselves to anyone, BE YOURSELF. So what if you get only a few people to watch your streams every day, they are there to see you and that’s what matters.
2:26 to all those VTWEETERS.
:O
Feels closer to Demon Dice, still pretty dope
Damn can we get calli and Dan bull on a track
HOLYHELL
the video is basically adding subtitles over an image that you packed your entire transition pack into
Man I really need to spit soon nice btw I only norm watch korone but might have to watch here too 🤣
Remember that fool who said "Sticks and stones can break my bones, but words will never hurt me"?  They hadn't met Calli yet.
As an independant Vstrreamer myself, this song only makes me want to work harder at being such. Sure it's going to be a rough climb, but at least the payoff will be worth it.   Whining about it only kills the mood more, so instead of just complaining and whining on how the song "makes you mad", try to push harder to be the best like Calli herself.
Voice, lyric, music. All of them sounds like Ariel from Icon for Hire.
Im not gonna lie i didnt really feel this one, i feel like the chorus didnt match the beat in the back. The songs has its good points and its bads with me.
This is perfect for engaging in boss fights. Reminds me of the recent Blasphemous stream of Calli. Looking forward to more of them real talk, cheers!
Trending from 31st to 28th.
Trending 28！
Reminds me of Five Nights at Freddy's for some reason Good song though
I love the song, and the lyrics are much needed in the community,  Keep it up  calli !
Why can't people grow a spine nowadays? I see so many people get butthurt over stuff that I consider it as nothing.....When someone gives me advice that I don't agree with I just decline it or just ignore them, no reason for drama lol.
is it just me or i find this kinda hot😳
"Send them away Death Sensei?" "No ambition. Try again next week." Aaaah. Their souls aren't even worth reaping.
I don't need to say anymore than what's already been said, you can't be an entertainer if you don't entertain, so do it, rise up and do your best, this song is a freaking masterpiece as always, feels like it's been ages since I got to hear new music from her besides her fist song on this channel
This song is literally a productivity rap song and I feel my productivity rising the more I put it on repeat. Thank you, Calli.
Love it so much, calli is the best
Other Vtuber : King cover Calliope : Nah fam.. i got my own 'king'
I have to listen to it everyday and comment my feelings, I can never got rid of my excitement from this song. I think I seriously admire Calli’s attitude on her works and I can tell the efforts and how tired for doing so much things by herself, Calli please take more rest, because I won’t giveaway my soul if my reaper doesn’t feel well
👏👏👏👏🔥
roasting up a beat so fire u can smell the boiling of vtweeter tears amazing work
There are some features in the cover image that really reminds me of Higanbana from Onmyoji (which I guess is fitting in a way)
Feels like I’m being scolded from being a Lazy Artist. I like it ! !
Goddamn. Death-sensei needs to promote you
"Welcome to the mountaintop"  I really love this line. The entertainment industry in any form only has a limited amount of support that can be given, whether that be corporate in nature or simply from fans. And like a mountain, not everyone will be able to stand at the top, and even those with the potential can't do so simultaneously. I doubt Calli herself would make the claim to be at the peak either. But it takes effort to climb a hill, let alone a mountain. That effort in this case is the work you produce.  Every content creator out there is putting in that effort, regardless of whether you're hitting thousands of views, hundreds, or even less. And every single one is worthy of respect, because people like me sure as hell aren't putting ourselves out on a limb. The diss in this song isn't for you. It's for those who look at the peak and can't even start their trek while complaining about those still climbing. You should know which one you are. But if you're the type who's been able to motivate yourselves before then you can hopefully take inspiration from this as well.
As the infamous Its_jawsh once said: "Back in my days I had to walk to school uphill in both ways"
I don’t who she shooting at but their definitely dead now.
New best song for pulling off all-nighters
this reminded me of fnaf for some reason
F-Wording GOOD

Vtweeters seething.
Probably gonna be the fastest Vtuber Original Song to reach 1M views on Youtube.  This is FIRE.
2:11 hope she said this to me with that eye
cool
I saw this on hatsune mikus Twitter thats how I knew it was serious
0:02 Is that Kiara?
:O Hooooooly. I am so glad I subbed to you because this absolutely slaps. I have been listening to this for ages. When I game, when I work its a masterpiece. No modern song can raise a finger to this
Ok but do you add the cheese first or the ham when adding to the cracker?
"then start creating, stop tweeting"   killed them with words, then guided them to the afterlife only to receive more burns
AOコラボキターーーーーー！ カリさん新曲お疲れ様です！
Soooo Calli.... new costume?
Swinging Scythe
Hans! Get ze fire extinguisher!
This song won't leave my head and won't stop hyping me up, which would be a good thing, but it's 6:00 am and won't let me sleep. Meh you win some you lose some
You know, if those people only tweeting where to make an hour long video, it would be a win even for Mori, cuz they're creating content, just like how she wanted in this song, not the best start, but they're starting to create something, if you plan to be a vtuber, just like calli said, make content, whatever it is, there will be some people who will enjoy your content, then you're on your road to becoming successful, not by tweeting, people won't follow you only because you tweet
やっぱり聴いてるとエミネム好きなのがわかる気がする
This song, I can hear nothing but burns. I think not even liquid helium can treat the wound this song/rap caused to those unfortunate enough to get burnt.   BTW, Nice song. It will be on loop forever until the end of time
Our true Overlord.  ALL HAIL
I feel like this song would be incredible if it were animated
This is no independent VTuber dissing song. This a a motivational song for everyone
The message of this song is just beautiful as it is genuine advice that can be applied to many things in life not just Vtubing
WHOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH SO COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
The illustration so nice 🎶
Oh yeah.   For someone said, "Calli is lucky she is member of Hololive", it is true.   But because of that, she learn the "responsibility" into higher level.   That burn hot as " C O M I T M E N T"  >:3
Soooo.... what the hell happened? Lol.
The master does it again
I remember before I hate rap, then I start listen to Daoko. Now here I am
カッコいい
So like... we can all agree this is perfection right?
This needs to get millions of views so the message could reach to everyone   Another to be added to my playlist for driving
idk why some people hate it when it so amazing and true
Imagine getting roasted by literally death her self
Your such a talented rapper calli!
天才。
Mori Senpai, Thank you. I have been lazy this past month with little motivation to create content. The thought of it being Impossible to grow in this community has gotten the better of me. However this song has lit a fire under my ass! I'm going to push forward again. Thank you for the motivation!!
Lovely <3
Let's keep streaming M
#30 trending nicee! Grim Reaper taking over youtube.
Another banger Calli
Music in my ears
I can’t get enough of this song, it’s soo good
When every past god rapper unites to make one rap...
Literally in love with this
I don't understand why somebody will hate this, this is a masterpiece.
Well... somebody has to say it...      She was lile the Tsar russian hidrogen bomb here...  Automatically follow her
This is so strong and motivating, gonna listen to it while struggling through hard day's work. Gonna listen to it a lot. <3
There are much more than in the beginning now but I will always stay a Deadbeat ❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wish Mori uses the instrumental as BGM in streams.
Mori's disstrack so lit, it set a bigger flame than the dumpster fire that is twitter
"Lose Yourself" by Mori Calliope
Yo... I like dis !!👏👏👏😊
It's a crowded Vtuber field these days. Gotta do more than just talk. Gotta walk it too. Otherwise, get off her d***. Just actually do what you're saying your doing. Calli gets it. Those she looks up to get it. Those who look up to her get it. We fans get it. Why can't you?
I'm not even a VTuber and this makes me want to be a better VTuber.
Why i got FNAF vibe 👉👈
I love this song <3
This thing slaps harder than my Step Father's belt
Infinite ammo
*Don't mess with the reaper waifu or she'll mess up your laifu*
What a champion. ^_^
There is truth in these sacred texts, how many got burned by reality though?
Here before 1M views
Me: My dad kicks ass with style My dad:
I just had a big stressful and terrible day with my school and family, your song allowed me to put out my stress so thanks ;)
I'm not a massive Vtuber fan but because you earned a like, comment and subscribe just for calling out ever 'Debut never' Vtubers so hard.  Mad respect.
this song made me start watching vtubers
triggered vtweeters must be foaming in their mouths like a rabid dog after this REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Calli paced around the hospital room. The doctor entered the room, with a bundle in her arms.  “Congratulations Calliope, it’s a bop.”
Calli being Blunt.... I love it
Calli: *politely answers question on how to be successful* Twittards: *angry twittard noises* Calli: guess i gotta be a little more blunt about my answer *drops this song*
I mean how could these "V-twitters" be mad at this? that just means they really consider themselves just as that which is really weird cause that's just yikes but deym this song really is fcking amazing god Damnnnnnn!!!!
今までで一番好き
Holy shi- this gives me fnaf vibes
好きすぎる
かっこいいとか可愛いとか色々あるけど、取り敢えず神曲。
Look who became a cute shrine maiden <3
Why can I hear Monty Oums "Can you match my resolve"?
Oh boi this is straight fire found this in my recommended already subscribed down the vtube hole I go
alright. Im legit digging this.
After hearing this song, those proclaimed "TBA EN Vtuber" wannabe get roasted so hard lmao. To Be Announced? More like To Be Annihilated
_"Stop it, stop putting more salt on their wounds."_
The talent she possesses is dangerous.
Never expected to be this good. Well done
I love it! :)
Your song so fire I forgot my house is burning
This song is proof that Calli is no longer retired, because from what what I can see there's a lot of corpses out there after this dropped.
Love your music Calli! It's beautiful.
What’s a vtweeter
As a vtuber i don't see why someone would get offended by this The truth hurts i guess.. but this Is also just a song, if you don't like it then skip it..
So... Eminem collab when..
Woof! Calli ain’t holding back, she slaying now!
Ironic they even took a week away to hide the shame... huh very ironic
This beat drops harder than me falling down the stairs
ふつくしい…… …息を呑むほど美しい歌声。 わたしはあなたにくびをはねれらたいです
At first I was annoyed with all the twitter warriors making a fuss about Calli's advice. But now I'm thankful to them, because without them we wouldn't have gotten this banger of a song. Your hard work is appreciated Calli by the deadbeats and more.
Royal guard:)
Best birthday gift!
vocal track seems buried under noisy sound effects. problems in compression maybe?
A fellow denizen of the underworld once summed it up pretty well:  "There's only those who will make history, and those who will not."
DEMONDICE be like
I hope this lights a fire under a lot of these wannabe vtubers and they actually start creating...we want to see more vtubers succeed but they got to at least try...sometimes tough love is what ppl need to get them off their asses
初めてRIP聞いた時と似た衝撃。神曲しか歌えないの？？？？
Lol
This made the mountaintop from Destiny 2 look weak. This was able to send the crucible players running.
Sick beats and fire lyrics yessss
Trending at #30, Calli slaying Youtube with her fire spitting.
In any creative field, budget and resources only can take you so far. Having the most advanced model, god-tier art, an overlay that works like magic, the NASA supercomputer, and an unlimited budget certainly helps. But if the voice behind all that isn't good, all you've made is a glorified tech-demo. In order to really make it in the creative industry, you have to do what the name implies: be creative. Think outside the box and work around your limitations while playing to your strengths. Avatar sucks ass and your art looks like trash? Get good at games or singing. Is your PC a potato and your internet is garbage? Prerecord your streams and make highlight compilations. Need to work a side-job to pay the bills? Make what few streams you have memorable and make the time. If it cuts into your sleep-schedule or social life, than so be it. If this is your passion, than you should be prepared to make sacrifices for it. If you have the means to record and upload what you make, than you already have everything you need.  Suisei came from the fucing dirt when vtuber premieres got you nothing, and ended up becoming a household name. Outside of vtubers, the biggest indie games of the past few years have been a point-and-click game running on an engine worse than unity and an rpg-maker game with garbage pixel art. There is no excuse for you to not make something. If you make nothing, all you are is a pretender who takes attention away from people who actually try.  At the end of the day, all creative products are selling you an idea, and the tools used to make it is just the means by which that idea is conveyed. If your idea is bad, it won't get far. If your idea is good, it will be spread. If you have no idea, you will get nowhere. Until you put out your idea, you have nothing, will get nothing and deserve nothing.  So you wanna make it as a v-tuber? Become one first.
日本とアメリカのいい所を固めた曲だ
Waiting for that day calli will like my comment day 1
Came here from Hero Hei's video, listened and next thing I knew clicked on the Subscribe button.  Really missed out a lot on EN Vtubers. This is dope.
This ain't roasting  This is The boiler of the hell
This is just inspirational xD I just remembered Eminem's killshot and I love it
🔥💀🔥
Woah if you watch this with closed captions then it's like karaoke, I've never seen that on youtube, cool
The amazing thing about this song- wait, that's wrong... *One of the many, many* amazing things about this song is how it can be either a merciless diss rap or a motivational song depending on nothing more than the way you look at it. It's both and neither at the same time. It's Schrodinger's Diss Track. And it's... beautiful.
ALRIGHT DEADBEATS, we swinging til the night falls, the sunrise, and we win the fight! I'll see y'all on the mountain top! Long live (though she's immortal) our Queen!
I sat in the pre chat and fell asleep before the premiere and forgot when I woke up
Dance till your dead?
i so badly want to get behind this kind of music because the mixing is great and the flow is fantastic but the song lyrics are just such a huge turn-off for me i don't know if this is exactly what calli wants to be writing about and if so then good for her but it's like the one thing keeping me from enjoying this to its fullest extent
Haha the sweet feeling of truth and those who really deserve to be here! You get them Calliope!
Why did I got a "Get Bubba'd" ad before watching this?
The more I heard to this the better it gets🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 Calli's power❤
V-tweeters are getting trashed dang this song is so lit. I like it.
What did humankind deserve to get such an amazing reaper
Oh Yes DRAW THE LINE! 428 people thumb this down. Likely those who think there entitled success simply by existing, and those who support them.  This is Pop culture, wanting to weasel its way in and take control, after better people built the platform for them.  The same sort who don't want to put in the work to entertain there fans, but preach to them.  Those who don't want to hear it, well they where never truly fans then. Then when there fans leave, there labeled this and that.  Because as we all know, these folks are entitled Success by existing, thus there failure is never there fault.  It YOURS!  Well Im glad to see as of writing this. 142,000 people Disagree.  Rock on Lady Reaper!
Idk if this is a distrack or what but, it sounds amazing
If that song was directed at me, I would probably never show my face in public again
I grow to love the song the more i listen to it...... It just that good
ok this is fucking banger
Fans had to be reminded she’s a grim reaper, who even while on break still sending souls to hell with her hot rhymes
Fire, just fire. No more to say.
Rip en vtweeters
I already know one of the songs that will appear in my Spotify Wrapped 2021
Cali is so clumsy in the stream but once she releases songs it's always got that mama gonna slap your ass energy
The ones who needed to hear it heard it loud and clear. The ones who your message and emotions reached are in a better mindset and I'm sure they're on the right path. Thank you for caring enough to want others to share in the happiness you have found doing what you love.
What is this bruh
Preach
I had no idea HololiveEN or Vshojo existed last week, now you all dominate my recommended feed and you do not disappoint.  All this drama, and here you are cutting through the bull with ACTUAL RAP that absolutely slays.  Mad props, Mori-sensei.
This is lit 🔥
god this song is so good
Cool!
Great content
Lol rip all of the bashers haha this is so good roast
K. Who here just got destroyed?
"12 rappers Eminem is afraid to diss"
This track was STRAIGHT UP FIRE! As an aspiring creator, I'm personally reinvigorated by her lyrics, and I plan to try even harder in the future
FIRE 🔥🔥🔥
i can see YAGOO smiles.
I love the Doom reference!  KAR EN TUR Rip and tear, until it is done!
Mori was not only spitting bars but facts as well. They hated her because she told the truth.
All Calliope did was tell people to stop tweeting and make content. Literally the best advice anyone can give.
idk what happened but this song is cool and you are cool too
YOOOO this is so different from Excuse My Rudeness :O brb looping this while my class goes on
これAOさんがトラック作ってるんか！
This is Straight up *Fire*
10% Luck 20% Skill 15% Concentrated Power Of Will 5 % Pleasure 50% Pain 100% REASON TO REMEMBER THE NAME This has the same vibe .
Im die now. Thank you forever.
i cant be the only one that got GET BUBBA'D amelia dog ads from Woohoolad
This song's going to the based department's special archive
Damn girl, you're rlly breathe taking, and not just as a vtuber, I can picture yourself being super committed to what you do, this is the kind of content creators I like to support.
Putting this and Lose Yourself Right next to eachother
I love how I think of this song as the harsher version of You're an ace, kid.
3:02 DeadBeats? She followed it with "rise", I'm sure she meant BreadBeats 🥖🍞🥖
R.I.P.
Immediately in the absolute Banger song playlist
Looks Like Calli is on a Hiatus from her "Hiatus".  Sasu Calli. =)
Calliope Mori: You want to be successful? Then make content. Vtweeters: Easy for you Ms. Company-Hire! Calliope Mori: So you have chosen death?
Can't stop listening to this! Such an amazing track! Keep it up Cali
Before anymore indie VTubers try to throw fire. They should realize Mori be doing 2 or like 3 other JOBS besides VTUBING. No offense thats far more impressive than anyone who's ONLY job is to be a fancy anime ish victual tuber. To be saying that Mori is hurting your fragile feelings is just giving Mori more ammo XD. As your admitting you are also weaker by begging for pity. If you want to say that you are better than corprate owned Vtubers. Get somewhere first rather than be some nobody VTuber with barely over 100 followers. Cause I shouldn't have to say that you shouldn't flex on someone for pity points when your the one that is an ant in comparison.   You are pretty much irrelevant if you got nothing to show for your effort. Not to mention pity is temporary.
This song set my neighbour's house on fire and they became infernals
You know she has convictions when she gets a drink thrown into her face the first day on the job at applebees gets up the next day and goes to work. People just want things handed to them with no effort required, and they think the entertainment industry is easy from an outside perspective for some reason.
This is legit fire
Me: "I can't draw ree" *Calli releases this song*  *Aggressively draws while vibing to this song on repeat*
I just wish I could listen to it on Spotify. It’s currently unavailable
AYO THIS IS ACTUALLY GOOD WTF?? I THINK I FELL IN LOVE WITH ANOTHER VTUBER
She had years of experience dealing with demon customers from a ghetto restaurant in the underworld. These vtweeters and haters are a walk in the backyard (not even considered a park).
DAMN CALLI DAMN😂🔥🔥💯
I dont know why but, damn... its so good. bangin to this song....
Please tell I'm not the only whole who added this to their playlist?
Vtweeters are on suicide watch
Oof I can feel shtty Vtweeters blood boiling. ENvtweeters that is. lol
i almost never comment in a video, but i just have to say one thing and is that i really love you calli, because since i started to watching you, literaly my view of the life started to change, and i know its irelevant but i started to learn inglish just to watch your streams, with every song you make, you make me wanna do my best and i really apreciate that, i'm very thankfull with you, i hope the best for you, and really thanks for all you do.  P.D: sorry for my bad english <3
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Eminem, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, 50 Cent: Welcome to the club, kid.
Ayo this low key bump keep it up but still SAO GANG🔥🤣 hmm I might become a vtuber😱
No mumble Rap here ALL BARS
Someone call an ambulance.... no, prepare bodybags for the Vtweeters lol. and the fire department because this disstrack is lit!  Also this track serves as a wake up call for me, thanks Calli XD
Welcome to the mountaintop, Dead Beats!
Congratulations on one million plays!But early
( ╹▽╹ )
CALLI I LOVE YOU
I’m die, thank you forever
Woah nice song!
413 dislikes?     wow twitter nerds yall are a bunch of p with the faqin ussy
Honestly pretty tone deaf of the vtuber who was propped up by a large talent agency to tell indie vtubers what to do. Yeah it can be annoying to see these pre-debut vtubers seemingly take forever to debut but you need to do it for networking and to gauge interest cause commissioning a model and buying streaming equipment is an expensive ordeal. Debuting cold turkey just means you have 0 people showing up and you are buried under the algorithm. if she started off on the indie route she would most likely do the same thing
I make this nightcore if you mind callie plsssss
This is my new fav song <3 <3
Oh, now I know why Eminem hung up on me... It wasn't because of a dead battery... He went silent.
The song is now trending
wait till this becomes a ranked osu BM
Bro, I got one word to say in quotation marks     SHE GOT "BARS"
The beat is insane
It's funny when these same people also feel they can gatekeep others of certain political persuasions from the community. It's not just that they don't put in the work, it's that they think they run the community, too, and believe they have a say in who is allowed in.  I wouldn't give them the benefit of the doubt that they're just lazy, I also think they have sinister intentions, but that's just me.
#29 on trending. Pretty good
was wondering why this vid seem familiar, the artwork and style of the vid have same scent as towa's.
God I mean reaper I just listened to this it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 probably one of my all time favourite keep up the amazing work calli I can't wait for you and the rest of your En vtubers and senpais and kouhais to all reach 2 mil
This Gives me Eminem Vives I love it...
When do we get a link so we can give her money for this? I've been tethered to my PC listening to it on repeat for a bit too long.
Calli, this is fuckin dope. I love how much work you put into your music.
Trending 29！
I didn't really have any interest in rap a couple months ago. But now... What have you done to me?:)
Hol up, I’ma call my boi to fire back  Me : Yo Em, there’s this rapper called Calli the death Eminem : hang up.
People, for goodness's sake!!! This is not all about cupcakes and rainbows!! This whole thing is a huge battlefield!! Do you really expect things will go for you? No!!! You, slacker Vtuber, are not the protagonist of this story. Nobody was. We only make our own in this history. There are no cheats nor shortcuts, just hardwork and determination.
ok ok yeah the song is an absolute banger and i cannot stress that enough, but ARE YALL IGNORING THAT  *T H E*  KYO PRODUCED THIS MASTERPIECE WITH MORI??? i am seriously hyperventilating lol
really sucks that for whatever reason this isn't available for me on spotify, wanna play it on repeat along with the other songs
730K in a day
She could drop an atomic bomb on these VTwetter but she drop a whole Tsar-bomb instead
free rent in my head
Why she had to go so hard on them🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fuckin' hell when I first hear this I thought Death-Sensei would get on the track himself to fucking kill me.  He didn't need to. I'm just a skeleton now.
Calli they are already dead stop it.   Great song!
I feel sorry for anyone who found this offensive. Being a Vtuber is a tough job. Every "real world" job is a tough job. Getting angry at this very basic fact of life could mean that they don't have what it takes to make it as a Vtuber.  EDIT: I just noticed this is #31 on trending. I wonder how many are going to fall into the rabbit hole because of this song...
Mori making another banger
Hypocrisy is it finest. She is on mountain top for two reasons: hololive and almost no competition. Good job catching the moment and staying on top, but luck don't give you right to lecture others.
"You miss 100% percent of the shots you don't take." —Wayne Gretzky   Man, it's hard. You'll fail multiple times, and it may seem impossible at times. But as long as you grind and hone your craft, the possibility is there.  If you give up before trying, then that's 0% chance of success.
Wow you are awesome✨
Her rapping gives me goosebumps as usual.
Funny how none of the Vtweeters ever responds with how hard they are all working for their vtubing career. Trying to give them a motivational push is completely wasted on them since they dont even intend on ever putting any more work into it than making an avatar and calling it a day. These MFers sleep twice as much as Calli and produce a percentage of her content and have the gall to say she got it all handed to her. Off with their heads!
How everyone doin
I came here to see those “Vtubers” who are offended by this. Are they here, by any chance?
So many vtweeters are going on about how this "attacks them". Like bro, if you're doing any of the following or are in any of these situations, this doesn't even apply to you:    - Working hard already - Wholeheartedly earned any success you may have - Don't spam tweets that help nobody instead of doing literally anything else (like making content) - Vtubing purely for fun and/or to help people; not for money - People who understand their own flaws and are working to fix them - People who are a bit lost but are at least trying to move forward - People who just need some motivation because they might've hit a roadblock despite their effort  I guarantee you that a large majority of the vtweeters out for blood either do not carry any of these traits, want attention, or are just easily offended.   On Death,  *Step up your fucking game, please.*
I love how Twitter is getting mad about this, as if they think they could of passed the criteria to get accepted into hololive
CALI GIVE ME A HEAD ;)))
Still on trendiiiiing pageeee!!
Damn this is fire 🔥
Absolutely love it! Listening while putting everything together have my own debut!
This song gives me so much motivation Calli. Thank you so much ❤️ It's not easy for us but we will be slaying till the sunrise!
Brilliant and beautiful Calli, keep up the good work and effort you are putting in to these songs/rap.
My grandpa really enjoyed this
Uufffff you're on fire 🔥🔥🔥 Haters and antis  can run away crying with their moms!  Also, i love the art used for the clip!  Love you Reaper Rapper!
716 angry "vtubers" have disliked this track
This burn is so sick it's motivational, I'm not even planning to debuting as Vtuber but boy oh boy I do believe I must starting to be productive
Fuqqin *F I R E*
which one of you that already watch calli's trash taste episode and hear what she's like in the past and now?
*Hey, to you reading* ..... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Nice art
Mori Calliope. . . Memento Mori :D
Weaboo over 9000
Shame Samurai Champloo doesn't have new episodes, this would have fit right in.
GOOD STUFF
Whooaaaaa! This is fire!!!
Ooohhh sweet~
Take me...oh take me away ....oh You reaper of dead, take me away in thy arm
Another fantastic song aaaaaaaa!!!!
I love it
Very hen hao epic
These lyrics are genius on so many levels... rhyme scheme, meaning, tone, imagery.... Amazing work Calli
This is one badass song
calli: it's 4pm, time for your daily beheading~! deadbeats: *_yes, calli...._*
guess I don't need this head anymore be used for a better cause old friend
one of most beautiful diss track i've ever heard
This song. I know nothing about this Vtuber and heard about her through Hero Hiei on youtube but listening to this song can be used in really any way when it comes to trying your best to succeed. That is the way I see it though. I could be wrong though but that is just how I see it.
いやかっこよすぎる
This sounds like demondice
Hey nux i think i just found your species
Calli just called out the rest of the """pre-debut""" Vtubers who'd done nothing but rant on twitter all day  SAVAGE.
On trending
Imma be Swinging this beat from Nightfall to Sunrise.
Damn in fire
vtweeters stay losing
綺麗でかっこいい 普段は可愛いし、最強か？
When’s this one going on sale?
Subarashi
HOLD ON THIS IS GOOD?
Oh so this is why coco post the neck vid XD.
I'm just here casually searching for the angry vtweeter comments
Let me just say this one thing-     "ALWAYS HAS BEEN"
threatening and aggressive motivational rap
Is this on Spotify????????
Ayoo im new to the scene but, whoever your adressing is dead, why didn't YouTube recommended me this? You are incredible!
Shes flexing lmao what a madlad
Straight fire. At first I wasn't really feeling it, but as I dove deeper into the song it became better and better for me. Praise Calli!
Calli: *gives actually good advice in a song*   Some other  vtubers in tweeter: huhu, we offended because she's absolutely right    Me: (facepalms)   // But as always this song is fire! It's very good! Keep up the good work
QUEEN!!!!
I've been on a journey to better myself for nearly a year now, and everyday I get better at being content with who I am. This legitimately gives me inspiration to keep to the path that I'm setting for myself, and to not give up. I've always had a fighter spirit in me, but kept holding myself back. Now, I'm dead set on giving it my all; This is just a great reminder to keep going. Thank you, Calli.
Love the new song! Keep up the awesome. 😄
I'm checking the Vtubers on twitter that has DEBUT TBA, but they removed it already like they started dissing Calli for slapping the truth damn the Queen Reaper is really reigning!! 👑
"then start creating, stop tweeting" eeeeyyyyy that's burns yo
the fact that people are getting mad over this is honestly making me like this song even more
Wait a minute.......... THIS IS A DISSTRACT!!! 😂😂😂👌
Thanks for the motivation, Mori!!
日本人のコメント少なすぎぃいいいい
Dios santo, que buena canción!!!!!!!!!
Am I the only one that sees this got on the trending page?!?!?!
WHOOAAAAAAAAAOOOOHOHOHOHOHOOOOHHHHH!!!!!! FREAKING... SAVAGE!!!!!! This is the kind of hard to swallow pills these latest two generations need, intoxicated in the quick gratification and delusions of instant success the internet provides them. A shame many couldn't take your advice, but at least you gave them a good roasting. And with that, I'm satisfied.
Spitting Fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
So we know where those dislikes came from
Take me, lead me. To the mountain top...
I just get this feeling from this song like trying so hard to follow any passion you might have is just so painful and never gets better because a world so full of competition means there is always someone trying to show you up. And even if you are successful it takes so much effort to maintain it that the original passion you had completely dies, and you're left working so hard at something you don't want to do anymore, and are forced to endure it because you worked your whole life to achieve this.
pog
Favorite song period
Like all her songs, this just has a rhythm that I can listen to for hours
GODAMNNNNNNNNNNNN LYRICAL GENIUS
The Queen reclaims her throne from Ame
Remember, she needs at least fifty of us filing in and ramming into her... snake.
Now we need Mori covering King, that would be good
Bruh im wait with russian subs
when you took rip and tear too seriously
I'm slow, so I needed context for this one as well... But damn she dissing the whole vtuber community with this trac, respect 👌
Vtuber drama or not. Let's agree that this song S L A P S
These no content little girls were crying about a joke pewdiepie made. I sadly am stuck with life holding me back but hopefully that will soon give way and the fruits of my own hard work while not abundant will start to show.
Be my wife
It’s such a shame that so many “wannabe” get offended by an established senpai of the field for merely speaking the common sense.
Damn she got a bar
Damn I'm getting eminem vibes right now
Dang this is straight fire! I'm a Gura shrimp but...
ここにきた日本人の人にアドバイス     字幕つけてみ、すげぇから
Very talented indeed..
Workout music
This is bangers and makes me want to do my modules lmao
if they want to prove her worng they need to finaly make some f word content
Put it on Spotify. Pls song is so good.
YO STEP ON ME SENSEI DAMNNNNNNNNN
Eminem has being so quiet since Calli's debut
🎩💙
I've been playing this over and over again
I'm not usually a fan of rap...  BUT I WILL MAKE AN EXCEPTION!
No EN Vtweeters were harmed in this video
This popped up in my recommended...and I honestly am quite impressed. Wonderful song Mori! I feel the lyrics resonated with something I personally have always thought. And that is..."If you have time to grumble, complain, make excuses, blame others for your failures, You HAVE time to improve yourself!" Anyways...Loved the video!
To those angered by her direct assault to VTweeters: "You either contemplate in anger and do absolute nothing but rant, or you take this to heart and finally "debut" with content (other than 10 second tweets)." Good day to you.
God I love this song! 😆
wow i see many heads flying
Oh boyo, look how she massacre them. That was beautiful!
This is gay
This song is awesome Mori! Keep up all the amazing work you do 💜
Love this, way cool, Cheers from our space lounge in Finland and USA
"start creating, stop tweeting" i remember when she said this on stream as advice for indie v tubers. I was like "facts"
I’m scared 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
I honestly loved that.  Adding it to my playlist.
When will this be on Soundcloud pls
First time listening to this. You earned my sub
Calli, the only one brave enough to call out them “V-Tweeters” and at the same time burn my computer.   Sasuga Reaper-sama
At first I didn’t like it, (didn’t vibe with me) but now this is a jam
cc
Let's gooo, I needed another song to put on loop  Now we wait for the spotify release, I need to work out with this beat
What the sucker line a reference or am I reading too much into it?
Guess I also needed this. I ain't complaining like the twitter folks, I know I'm lazy, and I needed this to remind me why I do what I do.
perfect song
Miko : play GTA Me : so that's what she mean SADISTIC SAKURA
2:04  *OHH SHE SAID IT, SHE ACTUALLY SAID IT*  *SHOTS FIRED*
Sposami grazie
Heads will roll.
Lit but the instrumental volume is too high.
Bro what even is this lmao? A disstrack about vtubers huh? Never knew there could be a bigger waste of time than normal disstracks.
Calli did NOT let Nas down.  Wasn't expecting an "Ether" to exist in the Hololive universe LOL
A diss, my favorite
I personally don't care much for rap, but I still had to drop by and pay my respects. Amazing work.
This is a *Masterpiece* that you can't *Ignore* *EVERYTHING HERE IS PERFECT!*
I don't believe you can always accomplish your dreams just by working hard, life is nowhere near that kind. Many people will work their whole life and never accomplish what they set out to do, but its better than not trying at all. Working hard is certainly better than wasting time and insulting the people who succeed. You're a badass Cali, your song has a great message.
Those dislikes probably from those butthurt vtweeters
Calli- tells a Vtweeters to do actual content to get notice Vtweeters- calls Calli talentless  Calli- looks like I have to teach them the hard way.
*G U H ~ !* 😍
Classe !! かっこいい ！
I don't hear to rap songs since 2012 but calli's raps really are a banger
MORI JUST WRECKED IT!!!!!
Our girl Mori trending. 👀👏🏻
Calli just keeps droppin fire
if only this was already on Spotify, am sad
Dmn got trap dubstep beat with calli... RIP me >:3
Thanks Calli, very cool.
So Death-sensei has already send Calli to interns on Yomi with Izanami, this is what I can see of her clothes 🤣
The only Reaper that can killed the World (and Twitter) with Disstrack *N O I C E*
This is fye i like the message 🤷🏽‍♂️ dont care if its tough for some other content creators, all that matter is that if u bust ur ass u will get the best reward, simple but hard to do
Trending 30！
I dont why but Im kinda into the metal banging in the background
This is so weird I like want to head bang cause the beat gives me dubstep vibes but it's also pretty good rap so I don't want to head bang.
WOOOOO we're trending baby!
*_HEAVY_*
For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4   For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 2 Peter 1:16   And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 1 John 5:20   Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2   If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 1 John 4:15   In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. John 10:28-30   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5   This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9   My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. John 15:12   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9   But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Colossians 3:15
LETS GO BOISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Holy fuck, calm down Calli, you just reaped the majority of Twitter with just a song.
Never heard a diss track being so motivational. Awesome beyond everything
YOOOOO ITS IN THE TOP 50 OF TRENDING
Why do I smell something burning
Radical
This Inspired me and awakened my reason why I love what I make. Thank you so much Mori :D ! Peace out.
nice
Best jam of the month goes to...
We literally got a female Vtuber version of Eminem here. I love it!
All I gotta say is DAYUM. Great song as always Calli! Keep up the great work!
Letsss goooooooooooo <3<3<3<3<3<<3<3<3<3<<3 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;A;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I am not so much into vtubers but this is fire lol
local vtuber murders half of twitter
this a diss?
Blessed
Not the hero we needed but the hero we deserved  -us probably
so did she drop demondice and take up mori? Is she done with the demondice name?
Trending?!?! This is truly a CalliPog moment!
Poggers
@Mori Calliope This.... This feels like you finally put your soul into something, good job.
#28 on trending baby! Hell yeah!!
Not gonna lie.. I vibe to that chorus. And the advice is genuine and great.. too bad so many people prefer to not take it and make even more excuses...

First time ive seen subtitles change color as the video goes on
damn 🔥
MORI MORI MORI MORI MORI I LOVE YOU

Inb4 1mil views
I agree those vtweeters need to step and start streaming instead of tweeting all the time
*How can VTweeters ever recover?*  *That's what they get for trying to diss a rap God.*
Whoaaa Japanese vibes
Well this is a needed wake up call... Just got more motivated
I mean, people talk about the amazing burns the song is dishing, but no one mentions the amazing artwork that goes along with it.   I mean if I could get a wall print of that I would be a happy little Dead Beat from now until my time comes.
Just one word: when on Spotify?
I'm glad she's finally getting the recognition she deserves. In her, so to say "past life" she didn't get anywhere near the amount of recognition she deserved. I mean, she's amazing at what she does, so its just so nice to see people start to appreciate her work. I just hope she doesn't work herself to hard, and is able to make songs she herself loves.
Slay it, Grim Reaper!
this, is rly rly good. good work
Re-watching this context makes it so much better, i had no idea what vtweeters were
I love this flow. I also like the "Get off your ass and work for what you want instead of complaining that you don't have it." lines.
I think u set fire to every deadbeats house. Amazing
The songs your making are getting better. Lets see what your skills can accomplish.
Yo this is lethal, yo if anyone knows Ghost Eyes comis from webtoon answer to this comment, this song fits well with it
1:43 why am i getting huge fnaf vibes?? And honestly I wasn't expecting this masterpiece jesus
Came to see what the hypes all about and after listening to some of her music she isn’t half bad 👍
"Worf. Damage report."  "Several hot fires have broken out across decks 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 14, and 21, and Wesley is still screaming."
lel imagine getting mad over a song like this on twitter. Idek who this person is lol
Based
God I am so glad Calli gets the attention she deserves. Vindication at its finest.
Yes yes YES!
Before this song, for years I never knew what to answer when asked "What is your favourite song?", But that's not an issue anymore
Just realized this was up at 2 in the morning and, wow. Your music never ceases to amaze me.
Damn, she went all in and it fucking shows. I love my reaper's bars as sharp as her scythe.
She simply does not miss
callie in stream: uwu callie in rap: OwO
I really like Calli's music and musical talent xD but just as a personal preference, I hate swearing ;-;
Eminem been real quiet since this dropped
Not a fan of rap, but damn this is f wording epic.
It looks like my love for you and your music is still growing and won't stop anytime soon.
YOU MUST GET ACTION
God I hope this is on Spotify later 💖 new fave song
Pog
Cali in her streams: GUH!  Cali in her songs: “CEO of go fuck yourself”
Keep it up mori love it
現代的メロディに歌詞もめっちゃ英語なのにリズムと音色でオリエンタルな感じが出るんだなぁ そして相変わらずラップ部分が聞いてて心地良くて称賛しかねえわ。
The roast of the impostors
Damn ok
I need the instrumental more than the lyrics
Very well written and performed cant wait to see cali with 2m subs! cx
Huh, the beat was _almost_ as sick as the lyrics. Almost. Because those lyrics were  F I L T H Y.
Anyone else hoping to one day see Calli's fire danced to by her senpai?
Here at 666k :) This beat is grimy 👏👏👏
Sublime, so basically Calli is making us understand that if you're thinking on become a Vtuber is not an easy task and be ready for everything at anytime...great call out.
666k views, nice.
Does anyone know when this is gonna be added to spotify?
Interesting. I don't know anything about V-Tubers, but nice song.
Yes, hello police? I'd like to report multiple murders and arson.
I am addicted to this song lmao
A song every V-tweeter needs to hear.
To do what others can't you have to do what others won't
Damn this song is so good
God damn fucking heat
(￢‿￢ ) Calli dropping facts.
Props to ekao for this awesome art.
vtubers
VTweeters: Do nothing but tweet and make no content Mori Calliope: Aims disstrack at VTweeters Vtweeters: shocked pikachu face
Based calli
This song is awesome. I really enjoy the songs that Calli makes. Always solid
まーたヘビロテ確定の神曲やん...
"I'll gladly live inside ya head but who the F pays my rent? It ain't me right?  Daaaaaaaang!! mic drop that was some ''oomph!''  but seriously, this entire song is a living message, packed with spices! and i dig it.
Ive never been massive on rap, but Callis' stuff is is an absolute jam
Wait she says «Are you a ♂️Slave♂️"»?! Daaaamn Cali, Wellcome to the  ♂️Dungeon♂️
the rap make my brain whole new level
I wanna be VTuber, mama.
Idk if this is the peak, but we’re on #32 on trending!
Sasuga cali waiting for the bext original song very nice
xD
This is amazing.
#32 on trending! I just listened to this now, and must I say, awesome~!!
fuck your beats are fire love your stuff keep it up g
*She just can't be stopped.*
When are you adding this to Spotify? I need to know!!
They hated Jesus for he spoke the truth
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
So many people seem to have the background on this song... Not me idk about Vtuber wannabes, but it's funny that they are so present they got a diss track
good as alwase, good job
I listened to this in Setsuko's stream and ahhhhhh it's so amazing
カッコいい！好き！
Who is sakura?
Calli took off the g in the graveyard  thus why ollie is heads over heels over this song like literally
Im not really a fan of calliope, nor the vtuber trend itself, but the second half definitely earns my sub.
I love song
What a damn way to motivate your community. Love it.
THIS IS COOL
The chorus really has a way of growing on you
I really don't get the deal with indie vtuber's. I plan to be an indie vtuber but I'm trying to find the correct app and to get a pc. I am trying to wait until I'm 16-18 years old to start streaming. When the hell called online school is over
this is EPIC
Looking at dislikes you can see it's those complaining on twitter in essays...but sadly here you get one vote😂👍
If you change "their" with "my", this would be a song about suicide. (Yeah, this is too obvious)
"Start Creating, Stop Tweeting" Toxic Indie Vtubers: I will ignore this cause I can't read,
Respect, Witcher
The subtitle effects are amazing!
was always kind of meh on moris music until this. This is straight fantastic
Inspiration!!!! Amazing song and im not even a big fan of rap, But hot damn this song hits like a truck.
That's awesome!! Nice beat
This is fire. hell fire
This song is a real banger, 10/10
I'm a little bit late but this is fire
A million BIG UPS to you Calli-chan! Because you are an awesome rapper, no, SHINIGAMI/REAPER.  2:04 "Then start creating, stop tweeting" CALLI-CHAN GOT THESE FAKE "VTUBERS" REKT. さすがBased〇神
カリオペさんの曲は普段聞かないタイプの曲だからすごい新鮮に感じる
Ahm... I felt the pain of all them vtwitters. Calli is insane. Omg the chills
Destroy the clout chasers Calli 😤
LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK, wait, I'm the one who should get speakers, everyone should listen to this fire track 🔥🔥🔥
Nice
I cannot fucking BELIEVE how good this is
2:25 HOLY SMOKES
Jason! Where are you!🤣
2:01 shots fired
355 V-tweeters didn't like the good advice, lol
I genuinely love it. It didn't give of the same vibes with the debut song, but it's at the same level. I say this because I see this as a different kind of beat/rhythm/kind...? of music but gave the same hype, for me, as the debut song. <3
The sun practically teleported into my house because of how *fire* this is.
omg so edgy, im fuuukin triggerred
Just love it
This is the final boss music.
Waiting this on spotify UwU
Anyone returned here cuz of hero hei?
This made me love mori even more😂😍
Congrats on trending!!!
#31 on Trending! Well earned.
I hope the remix that t+pzolite make isn't as loud as the beginning of the original
This gives BoyInABand vibes
Congrats being on 31th trending on YouTube
"Start creating, stop tweeting"  OOF!!!
Damm this rivals bread beats
Yagoo's dream has evolved from an idol company to an execution group with this diss track. I'm all for it.
*"Is that a personal attack or something?"* - Vtweeters
I get that ALOT of you are viewing this as "telling tough love to vtweeters" and yes, it is part of that. (and I agree, I am not a fan of vtweeters who dont do anything other then being "anime karens") BUT, IMO, the overall message is, go out and DO something. Stop being lazy, stop blaiming others for your failures of you not even trying, and do ANYTHING. (Not just Vtuber, but better career, better job, better college, etc.) And even IF you fail, that is life, it is the competition. Just because you put in effort doesn't always garentee a success, however, if you don't even PUT effort, then you won't even have a chance of succeeding.   Anyway, even herself is not just "dissing at the mountaintop" She is "at the mountaintop" STILL swinging her scythe. (i.e. still putting effort to climb higher) and is bored that the competition at her position is weak. She is basically taunting you, "come up here, and actually face me, because I want a challenge from someone who is putting an effort"   Anyway, that is what I got out of this video. (This is my IMO view of the message, you can be different)  EDIT: Thank you all for comments and Mori for liking it. This have become my personal most upvoted comment in youtube. EDIT: And I didn't know editing the comment kills the heart/like from the youtuber. RIP. Yes mori, please off with my head.
Damn....
i feel like you already know you did nothing wrong it was an honest advise, but i need to reasure you are right and i hope you dont mind what they say. now the song crazy good, as expected, i really love the changes on the music.
This is to the vtuber community as Ice Cube's "Us" was to the black community in the 90's
as an independent myself, this song makes me strive to better my art and my streams   god this song is fire
I feel like Calli watched a documentary of the French Revolution for some inspiration cuz it’s off with their heads!
...I like you.
Breaking news: A huge gathering of Dead Beats with scythes and sword in hands are marching to every fake Vtubers' house. Wait this just came in they just got a request from the KFP owner to hunt down a zombie Idol that stole her wife.
Very banger!  It's true, nut up or shut up, if you wanna be somewhere else in life you gotta work for it! Crying gets you nowhere! BIG LOVE
Callie just killed those wannabe Vtubers.
She. Is. CUUTINNNNNNNNNNNNNNN'     Love this lmfaoooo
Absolute fire.
I feel like she's the one who waiting for us at the top of the mountain when we're adventuring
calli is so nice she gives advice on a diss track
Yooooo its trending, hell yes
Her musical❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ilustration...screening... My head still swinging...
can we talk about the subs?
Man I'm out here bopping my head to the certified bop While I should listen to the message in it's socks "Stop tweeting, start creating" It's brutal, but it's true  It's the bestest of advice for people like me and you I always say "I'll do this and that", But I'm just a sitting duck, too much luck on my back Let's stop with the promises, make ourselves honest So we don't get this samurai slice from our goddess (Boi got bars, but fr tho)
Very good
dammmnnnnn shits fiirreeeee
This is fire!!!
Damn she really shredded every predebut to pieces like that. They don't realize how much soul Calli puts into her job every day.
Oof savage
and people are mad at this? what????
Nice tunes for NYC walks
Exceptional.
Wow calli is this a disstrack to someone lol. Fire
Trending.  Nice.
this needs to go onto spotify
I knew it sounded like a TopHamHat Beat
Not only do I love the track and the singing, but the lyrics are just amazing.
top 10 rappers Eminem was afraid to diss
ADD TO PLAYLIST
sooo whre those envtuber who keep gatekeeping but show no content whatsoever
this beat is fire!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This song and a borgar is everything I was needing, thank you for the message
FUCKING BASED
#33 on trending lets goooooooo
Not a fan of rap myself but I like the message in the lyrics.
Replay button showed up* Me : Again! Again! Again!
John 3:16-17 16-For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen!
3:10 "Off with their heads"                       -subtitles Ngl thats awesome
Let's loop this!
Idk why ppl got so offended by her message, it honestly just inspires me to be a better Youtuber. (even tho im not much of one lol)
Alternative title: Calli literally destroys vtweeters
Me: "I don't like rap or hip-hop." Calli: "Strong words for someone in GUH distance."  Gotta say, previous songs were really good, but this one is just fire.
It's brutal and all... But I will give the point to male vtubers.  Like, being a female vtuber is like, so fucking easy; but telling that to a male vtuber is like a rich person telling someone poor "Just work and you'll be rich like me someday". Like, come on, as much content as a male vtuber creates, even the most popular ones don't really get past 300k, even with a big corp behind them,
She qualifies for the top 10 rappers eminem was afraid to diss.
*F I R E*  In audio form.
That was fire!!!
DAAAMN CALLI!!!!
I’m just here vibing with the song :)
ah yes, another song for my spotify playlist
rap collab with Nyanners when??
See? This is why I love Calli!!  She really does swings her scythe and took everyone's soul  Some in a good way... Some in a bad way~
Wtf why is my house on fire?
cooooool!!!!!!!
I'm gonna be honest, I have very little knowledge of V-tuber culture, buuuuuuuut this is some heat that I would gladly go to war in defense of.
I’m confused people wanna cancel Calliope and her song?  Bloody hell thats bullshit
Man, so that's why japanese rap died because she KILLIN IT WITH THOSE BEATS
If you aim for the queen, don’t miss.  Good, tough advice and great music.
the guy who made the english captions:  no need to thank me
331 people are salty vtubers endlessly stuck in Twitter purgatory
ngl im not the biggest fan of Calli's music but this is pretty dope
Nothing makes the day better then a new Calli song
Somebody help me, I think I have alien hand syndrome. I can't quit clicking on this song. Not that I'm complaining at all, though.
This is the best pre debut ok, fight me
Sadistic miko      Xd
At first I thought the lyrics was about some romantic poetry until certain line reads "start creating, stop tweeting", make me realize that the entire poem was about message for us to stop talking too much and start doing some act. As expected, nice song Calli. Thanks for the song and the message.
Trending!
I thought she was a reaper on a hiatus, but clearly she's working overtime...
I love raps that fucking talk about this kind of stuff, it gets ya thinking a lot about your own stuff and what can be done to achieve success. Keep it up calli your music is fucking amazing and it has helped me enjoy rap (other music similar to it) even more!
Yes I am a Slave, your slave.
🥰🥰🥰
Been putting a project of mine on permanent hiatus for a few years now...  Cut to last night and now it's taking shape again, ready to be released sometime around next year if things go well...  Thanks Calli, thank you for reaping that annoying creative block that killed my desire to develop my most ambitious work...
Yo! #32 on trending! 🙌
Aw yea it’s trending on YouTube. GOOD JOB CALLI 💖
Yees
The part she roasting vtweeters, i just went poggers
2:05 this made me laugh cause it’s true
Wait WTF this is a diss track?
Exactly the kick in the ass I needed tbh. Let's get this bread Breadbeats.
Mhm delicious
Congrats 1M!!
カッコよすぎて森
I'm literally debuting in a matter of weeks thanks to Calli. Her tough love spurred me to quicker action.
as aspiring Vtuber, i feel roasted and I LOVE IT. this Woman perfectly knows what's happening, she's done and like she says: NO EXCUSES JUST DO IT. And that's what a caring mom does actually says to their children
「あい^～」の部分すき
Vtweeters are shaking in their boots rn
トラックK'sやトップハット狂が関わってるの本当ビックリする！
*This song roast so hard it burns my house in process*
this is so fuckin goooooooodddddddddd , well done calli
Really awesome calli your rapping is fire keep it up🔥🔥
She can cut me in half. I don't even care anymore if Being X disagrees with me.
Congrats for 1mil Calli :)
Woaahhhh this is hightier song man love u calli
Wish I had remembered to wake up in time to see the premier, amazing song Calliope!
Hottt fireeeeeeee. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
All them angry vtweeters rofl
After hearing it lots in the past few hours, I gotta say, Calli you're getting my blood pumping with this.   I'm just a watcher, but the advice you're giving here isn't just aimed at the tba scene, but to the general content creator pool (illustrators, musicians,etc).  And after the hype about chopping off heads wore off, I think I realized I'm soaked in blood cause the scythe swung pretty close this time.   Better start dusting off my sword
When I saw the title Riddle instantly popped in my head hahaha
certified banger humu humu
This song is so fiery that I have to bring a fire extinguisher.  Oh no, the fire can't be extinguished!
"Most people rejected her message." TBA : "shut up !" "They hated Calliope because she told them the truth."
Calli straight up murdering people with her words Jesus. The only way we're gonna put out the fires she started is plant bombs in the ocean and cause a controlled tsunami. Great fucking song.
Now i really need the most hardcore artist of girls for M to draw a story featuring calli dominating you into a sobbering mess <3 HNNNNNNNNNNNNNG
this reminds me of boogers!!!
Mori literally massacuring all the suppose Twitter Stans who call themselves Vtubers. *Stop, stop they're already dead.*
But wait a sec, don't we get killed by what we don't know  if we take advice? I am sure glad that this advice isn't directed at me. XD If I was a YTer, I would gladly take it, tho.
This is beautiful
This was fire
Guess i have a new favourite song
i like guras singing better
I need Calli to force me to finish my art projects through a sick rap song
I need Calli to force me to finish my art projects through a sick rap song
This is currently how I feel about my employers. How ironic.
I heard this song got hated?
Great music: Check Great Art: Check Tough love within the lyrics: Check  Also her voice is badass as hell so that's another check.   Really though, this song is about putting in the work and having the passion for anything you do in life. Calli just wants to give us that push, and seeing this as anything negative is just not realty.
Still maklin my way up that mountain, but I aint  givin up!!!   Straight fire Mori , loved it keep up the great work!!!
Why are the vocals mixed solo? This is a rap song, The vocals should be louder than the music.
Great song Miss Mori! I look forward to more of your songs, Keep being awesome!
idk why but i hear "melontop" instead of "mountaintop" at some parts of the song lmao
help my house is on fire
1:13 "RIP and tear"? Oh dear, I think I hear the heavy metal nearby.
B A R S 🔥
Imma skip over the actual meaning of the song to just gush over her actual delivery: God when Calli raps it’s so so clean and the words are so CRISP. The melodic quality of her voice really shines in this song too (also lower register Calli is: 💕 ドキドキワクワク). My ears are very happy but at the same time upset with me for playing this song on repeat
This is DUMMY HARD
When gonna be avialble in spotify?
Mori you slaughtered my soul again......
Pure tough love
The Vtweetuber Slayer season 1 opening looks awesome!!  :D
beautiful song along with beautiful artwork
Put this in spotify bbg
🔥🔥🔥
和服カリちゃんめっちゃ似合ってますね〜  ありがとうございます(((o(*ﾟ▽ﾟ*)o)))
This is the only time that this sentence has flown across my head.   "PLEASE STEP ON ME!!"
Well, this track earned my first hololive sub. Nice tough love Cali!
Flay Me Alive!  - Evelyn (From League of Legends)
Whos making this into an Osu! map?   I need an excuse to play this song 2k times...
好き
We got her on trending!
Tsundere Rap?
Ahhh, throwing the trash away. Nice. My soul is yours. My head though... I think I'll let it blaze for now.
She spittin’ flames giant enough to take the entire Twitter community by surprise.  Soo cool!
Mori killing Twittards
I had quite literally 0 idea what the lyrics of this one was, until I saw a 'Hero Hei' video discuss the controversy (also something no idea existed).  Lesson of Story:  Stay off Twitter.  /caseclosed
Certified banger while being motivational while dissing. What a masterpiece Calli has made
When is this gunna be on Apple Music I need this playing in my ears 24/7!
Calli comin at us again with the hot hot fire.
God the beat is so god tier
Forget my head swinging till sunrise, it’ll be swinging *forever*
Lmao Calli just nuked Vtweeters into oblivion without even blinking. Dont mess with this Reaper, shes a legit killer
Be my waifu Calli 😳
I don't know who you are but this is fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Holly molly I fking love Calli
"Off with their heads" is my favorite line in Alice in Wonderland, so i expected some murder lyrics.  *after listening to the song*  This is massacre though.
LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOO
All the dislikes in this video are form those who got "offendead" by Mori 🤣
You just destroyed fake Vtubers    *I love it*
jesus christ she killed vtweeters
Bro she is like a female version of J. Cole just inspiring these upcoming vtubers to actually do their job AS Vtubers. Same as how J. Cole gives advices in his songs. Too bad some Vtubers actually took offence to this song lol
A lot of bodies to clean up today...
aight this is my favorite song of urs, heard it 15 times already and imma show my neighbors my religion when my home theater is fixed
I didn't know what to expect when I clicked this video but damn, this song is fantastic.
👀
I-I will stay committed! There is work to be done! I don't have a scythe...um... *picks up katana and pencil* Must create. Must get back to writing. Create!
Calli has officially become too powerful and I welcome our new underlord
Song:  *has a huge part on dissing vtweeters, which everyone picked up right away*  Me, who didn't even know 'vtweeters' were a thing until today:  Ah yes, I understand this song, get em Calli!  Actually her best song thus far though, good stuff!
ITS NOT AVAILABLE ON SPOTIFY WHY OH WHY
Fire! Love it
Didn't realise were in the French revolution with all the heads coming off
That line "Sadist Sakura" is now something i want to use for everything
When she said "Heads" at the end my soul left my body.
The best part about the song is that yeah it's harsh, but it's tough love, and there's a lot of good advice in there for not only Vtubers, but for anyone looking to get a career or a following both on and off the net,  you've gotta put in the work and stop complaining when everything isn't immediately handed to you on a sliver platter. It also helps that the song kicks A** and is catchy as Hell... pun entirely intended.
I can already smelled the burnt salt from "them"
Mori Calliope: 2 VTweeters: 0
I don’t know how you did that but the subtitles turn red THATS COOL
We have found the true queen
Love the song, sad part is the people this us directed at are so brain dead that this will go over their head
Her best song yet for sure
God I love this, firstly, must say the alliteration at 0:25 was truly awe inspiring..! But more importantly those lyrics were a  proper godsend..!  A rapping revenant, revving her righteous rapping upon the walls of written wrongs....
I can't wait for pandemic to end to see a live performance!
So, if this reaper is currently in hiatus and is already slaying this many, how much do you think she'll slay once she gets back in the reaping business?  Good thing this C thing happened while she's on break, or else humanity will be doomed
I cant wait for the day to hear a Calli song on the radio while im driving.
YUHIKES!!!
Calliope Mori The Eminem of Vtuber World
i REALLY loved this song and the message about working hard, and not stopping the work, even if it hurts you, but take it to get stronger :D
I’m definitely going to be playing this on repeat all day
Now we need remixes and osu beatmaps
AYO A BACKING TRAKC BY AO??!?!? NEAT
When does it go on the music stations?
eminem vibes
so this is where demondice went  neat
dam
Damn Calli. How can something be so savage and motivational at the same time?  We can’t let her down Deadbeats. Let’s rise!
YES
A song that speaks the truth to just about anyone who needs to get ahead.
She dropped hellfire again RIP to the dropout V-Tubers
The beat switch up is so fire🔥🔥🔥 great work to everyone who worked on this Calli your music is amazing!! Can't wait for more!
Love the content you put out but love the music you make the most. Awesome single hoping for a album somewhere down the future
\M/ With you every step of the way.....though i'm terrible company, so understand if you put me down after a while.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Anyone else cant listen to this on spotify
I didn't really follow but I added it to my playlist anyway
Thank you... I really needed this and to hear this from someone. My soul is now always yours for the taking
God that snare is amazing lol
🔥 🔥
DAMN! Not even the pits of Hell can spit so much heat!
New Calliobanger woo \o/
This is FIRE! My fingers are twitching to play this song in a rythm game.
Well Ded Beat grab the shovels 'cause thats a lot of bodies.
Song is probably one of my favorites from her, but to give honest criticism: While I do love the beat and think is fun to listen to, I feel like it overpowers the song at quite a few points. It makes it hard for me to concentrate on what she is saying. Like, if the subs weren't there, I'd have zero idea what she is trying to say. And, honestly, I think that's probably one of the biggest disservices to her that you can do because it's clear how much thought and work goes into crafting the lyrics. They should be front and center, not the background track. Especially for a song with such a potent message.
Hooo boy, this is just awesomesauce. It's Songs like this, and people like you (referring to Mori) that give us a glimmer of hope for humanity. This is just oozing awesomeness. Even if not for that, it's still a catchy song. I don't normally like rap, but this.... this I can make an exception for.
God, the Junji Ito vibes in the art, absolutely marvelous
Based Rap
I give you a complete salute, Miss Mori!
are we just gonna ignore "callioP"
AAAA
We all knew this song was good before we even heard it. Every time we listened, we just confirmed what we already knew.
💗
Sadistic Sakura seems like a cooler title 😈
And here I thought no song can compete with Amelia “Pop on Rocks”
very   cool!! 超かっこいい!!!
So this talks about her prospective of being a vtuber in a rap very interesting
Would you believe if I said that my house had a blackout after the end of the song when I was watching live?
noice song
Condolences to those who got their heads chopped off.
Interesting
I love that she dissed VTweeters that’s gonna make for some good drama
The song will be on Spotify  on  2/2 .
This is exactly what i needed, thanks mori, i love you, seeya when i get to the mountaintop <3
This slaps harder than my dad after seeing my report card.
spitting pure fire
The flowwwww thooo
The real question though, when will this be on Spotify?
Wow. Just wow.
Just like EM, how many Vtuber careers is she going to destroy? lol Rip
This gave me chills. I hope the people on the receiving end dont need therapy over this.
Such a fantastic track! Your vocals, mixed with the meaning behind the lyrics, combine beautifully with the beat to create this phenomenally powerful and motivating track. Definitely going to be listening to this one on repeat.
On fire...
I'm not on twitter so I've no idea who this is aimed at lol. Who pissed on Mori's cereal? Great rhyme scheme though, damn.
Dayum, I'm not one to usually like rap except maybe a very few songs, but this is pretty lit, and gives a good message, I can dig it.
somebody please call the firemen, my pc just caught fire
Calli: "off with your head..." Me: "... DANCE TILL YOU DEAD"
The music is beautiful no I mean everything in the video of it like how gorgeous you are in the video Mori Calliope. This is why the 1 million subscribers likes you.
cute  & cool  girl
600K  views 17 hr godspeed
Cali is one of my favorite vtubers because of her content and songs.   Now she is giving vtweeters some tough advice. I love it, now I hope these vtweeters should start creating then tweeting. people wanna escape reality then hear drama over and over.  I am trying out vtubing and this motivates me honestly!
She really said "Don't ask for whom the bell tolls-" and pointed at the v-tweeters answering "-it tolls for thee."
I'm getting huge "lucky you" vibes from this song. Love it
Oh this is just to awesome for words.
madlad
This is also a love letter and thank you letter for all the shonen protagonists in Hololive and out there in the world.
I'd listen to this more than Lil Uzi
Imagine if this was bass boosted
One of the best songs i heard in a while
When this gonna be on Spotify?
bop
I can dig it.
Your music is like a flavour of literally anything that everyone tells you to try but you keep putting it off and one day on a whim you try it and now you're fucking addicted. I love it
I need this as a wallpaper
10/10 would pay for a ticket to watch on stage and buy merch while i was there.
Bro tfw ya realize this was a diss track for the en vtuber drama
Everybody, ATSUMORI! Best Diss track of 2021 nominee. HOTTER THAN THE FLAMES AT HONNOU-JI TEMPLE
genius!!!
Am I the only one getting ShadyVox vibes from this?
Arise my fellow Dead Beats.
This did it. I kept out of the whole VTuber thing for this long but I lost. This was so savagely cultured that I just cannot stay out.
Off with their heads!
I love this one. It's my favorite from you so far.  Great song about the difficulties and the hard work needed to be an entertainer.
Alternative title: Dad's Tough Love
This might just be my personal favourite Calli song yet, the lyrics are slapping almost as hard as her scythe!  (っ °Д °;)っ If the new songs keep getting even better we will soon reach Ascended Dead Beat status... (≧∇≦)
Nobody did this, and I'm disappointed, so I will.  "1:12, until it is done"
I wasn't expecting this song be supportive/motivating us!  Thank you calli, we needed this
She literally just destroyed those "v-tubers" on Twitter who just tweets lmao
I keep coming back to this
This just straight up fucking slaps.
My eyes are hurting but my ears are smiling
TOPHAMHAT-KYO
nice
I cannot like this video enough times... one like does not express the enjoyment of this video... Thanks Calli, thank you so much!
It is kinda hard to get into this at the start but it becomes really good after a bit
nothing worth doing is ever easy and nothing worth having is ever free.   live your own life, do what you enjoy, and have fun, never think you need everyone else's approval or backing to do great things because if you keep waiting for someones else to make your life better youll be waiting forever.
This is basicly just a TED talk in the fashion of a rap song. Hats off.
amazing lol  off topic, this would be god tier wallpaper if there were no lyrics on screen, not hating or complaining im loving this more than i should be
Bruh this is 🔥
Savage song...I fucking LOVE IT!
Ok axe my comment on the other song, THIS is a diss track to twitter haters.
I've always been so-so at poetry interpretation but the lyrics here were very understandable. This is very incredible music.
Day 29 of asking Calli to collab with Neffex
LETS GOOOOOOO
no drug no thots no gun just an anime tsundere tiddie reader dropping some sick beats
<3<3<3 yesss~
Not even a day has passed and the song's already got half a million views lmao She's an absolute reaping Queen and she proves it time and time again with all those sick rhymes and beats
Calliope mori just murder everybody with just one song .   ALL HAIL THE QUEEN !
Very good, very unique style of music
This song is even better knowing what you had to endure to get here.
3:03 That sound is perfect
I like hearing Calli curse
Good job, Karen.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is straight up murder! And I love it!
mori all your songs are the best
Surprisingly pretty good all around
I think I need to sue calli for burning down my house with fire bar
"Expect no less than Earth shaking when these Dead Beats rise..." I have been blessed by her words... Wait for me Calli, I'll make something that'll make you proud.
I think I'm in love...   WITH THIS TRACK!!!
Kitsune Calliope poggers
Ahri its you?
"All Like "Easy for you to say, Little Miss Company Hire." As if these moves did not take heartache and these tracks are not fire!" Damn, Calli! They're already dead! Stop burning their corpses!
That moment you realize Calliope is the Enimen, of the V-Tuber community.
I constantly listen to Calli’s music and music I’m praying for the day she raps over a filthy trap beat with lots of brass instruments 😩
Taking notes, Antis? School is in session. And you've got catching up to do.
she really said: HOLD MY BEER
Is this a low key diss track?
This kind of tough love is everything the VTuber community needed.
This is r*pe  to my ear, it is so bad , she is just mushing sentences together and call it music (censored because YouTube doesn’t like that word )
VTweeters going up like SoCal in August 2020
dude this is sick!!!!1
Dang, Cali just become a true reaper
FIRE! Senpai
Damn son this song is fire!🔥
the song is great but lower the amount of distortion some of the sentences are muffled because of it
So whens this on iTunes
Great
i totally haven't been sitting here hitting replay for an hour straight, i don't know what you're talking about.
Thank you Calli.
GOD, it's SO GOOD
Sekiro boss callie isn't real she can't hurt me
She said Rip and Tear, it seems no one escapes from DOOM
Oooofffffff🔥🔥🔥
This is so meta-anime. In anime its all about putting in the hours (well mostly the shonen troupe lol) and to finally see that tough love in music is awesome! YOU GO BOI!!!!
Damn bro stop spittin fax my house is already flodding
If you like this song, you can also check out Top Ham Hat-kyo, who did the track :D He's part of Fake Type.
I fucking love it  How do i become a vtouber? Do the damm work   Just like anything else  Bravo
For some weird reason I wanted to become a vtuber by listening to this song
"Stay committed and follow my leading" Learn to take advice, and if someone offers advice take it.
Wtf, this song gave me a boost.
Goddamn not even a day and already surpassed 500k views, well, most of us are looping but still hahaha AWESOME WORK AS ALWAYS CALLI!
日本調も似合う…
"I'll gladly live inside ya head, but who the fuck pays my rent?" I don't know, the simps may have the answer.
"I'll gladly live inside ya head, but who the fuck pays my rent?" I don't know, ask the simps for the answer.
Fellow Deadbeats feast your eyes on this historic masterpiece. As this song rocks not only our ears and mind but also the whole ENVtuber scene. I am proud to witness this momentous occasion.
yo Yo YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The biggest flex in this song is just pure work ethic, and I am here for it.
Never did I think I'd find something that hits harder than my father
Nice and groovy beat but the lyrics end up sounding really edgy
I expected much harsher tough love, either way, a banging tuna as always
If Calli actually made a song with Eminem I would die from excitement
i love this so much, i can totally imagine cali doing an irl idol gig. would be epic
This song makes Me concerned about my well being but is it weird that Im okay with that
Ah. So she really is a fan of Eminem..... I love it 🥰🥰              ( for yall who don’t get it. It’s along the lines of “stop tweetin n start creatin” 😉)
why is she actually female eminem what the fuck
Its not even 24 hours and this reaper got 500K already! DAMN
I know its your job but damn you killed them
*Pulls out guillotine* YAS QUEEN!!!
:O
i mean, if even Death herself talking you doesn't motivate you, i don't know what else will
I'm smell something burning.....Where it's come from??  Oh...found it!!!! That smell come from Twitter!!!  Oh!!! Guys!!!!  please call ambulance!!!! I saw a lot of people roll on the ground.....they whole body are burning!!!  Wait!!! after look carefully......just call morgue....  They already scorched......    :D
man I don't need to be told that I don't grow because I'm lazy I already know that. D:  well that'sts not really what she's saying but you know what I mean >.>
Man I guess I've been isolating in the cave for too long, what the fuck is a vtweeter?
Your song makes some good workout music. Im already motivated to start pumping weights.
This isn't a roast, this is a whole rotisserie.
Very good song 👍
2:44 Hol up did she paraphrase the hell of a quote that was "If I wasn't death I'd want to die, thats life I guess" from her debut stream?
Man this is dope! You surely have great talent to pull this off! It surely gives a good message of how it's not just about tweeting but making something of yourself. Love it!
i never thought she could top  'excuse my rudeness , but please RIP' , but this is even more of a banger !!
Mori: * gives advice to v-tweeters politely * V-tweeters: *angy* Mori:
When will this get uploaded to spotify? This song is FIRE  Edit: It's on Spotify now
i cant stop listening to it dfgjdgbsdj its so goooodddddddd
Damn Calli really just said she lives rent free in our heads
lmao tba vtweeters stay mad, all that energy could be going into your 'debut' stay spicy, Mori<33
*Suddenly, I want to be the apprentice of Deaths apprentice*
Are you a dragon? Because you're spitting 🔥!!
"Then start creating, stop tweeting"  oh my god they're dead... poor souls
Calliope is truly an inspiration 🙌
Beautiful song cant wait to have this playing all the time cant wait for ur next song
1789 mode ON
It is a shame that people have decided to fight with words against someone as lyrically lethal. Perhaps if they practiced more they could stand a chance, though Death is inevitable, so she will win in the end.
i came here from the stream about the cardboard debut and this is sick
There are tons of V-Singers but there is only 1 V-Slayer lol 🔥💀🔥
Wicked song!
This is what I originally expected from the reaper/rapper. Rappers are kind of known for confidence, at least on stage, and this is just a direct challenge to people who doubt she can have that. The way I see it, she WANTS other Vtubers and rappers to stand on the mountain with her and challenge her fame. That whole anime trope of doing anything for a good fight with confidence you'll win.
OK MISS MORI GO OFF
So I want to know about the drama. What happened?
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
DAM, weren't you on hiatus girl this was just a strait up massacre
"Lamar roasts twitter" vibes
I would like it more if her voice was a bit more louder than the instrumentals. But that’s all the work of sound design and mixers
its good but i think her voice is too far in the background, they should lower bgm and push up her voice more into the front.
Reminded of the music from Bowser's Kingdom from Odyssey, and not just because it's "Japan".
The subtitles cool asf
When's the Watson ft.?
God this is beautiful.
289 Dislikes from the self proclaimed VTubers Rofl
Did she just do a metal rap
So much fire. We deadbeats all in hell, can hear them slamming on their keyboards. 🍻
AMAZING AS ALWAYS!!!
Rip "VTweeter" 2020-2021
Brilliant work, Calli! Calling out these people, motivating content creators, and the beat slaps. I could listen to this all day.
Shinigami-sama sanjou-da!!!!!!
Holy fuck, you killed them dude.
the most lit track form callilope.
Now Playing : [ORIGINAL SONG] Off With Their Heads  00:00  ●━━━━━━───────  3:38 ⇆ㅤ  ㅤㅤㅤ ◁ㅤㅤ❚❚ㅤㅤ▷ㅤㅤㅤ↻
Hesitation is defeat.
Calli normally: Clumsy Cinnamon roll Calli singing: Evil Idol Trope
Damn. That wasn't just a mic drop, she chucked a damn asteroid on the vtweeters.
Nice
Ths song s gold, pure gold. One can really tell you poured your soul in it.
Thanks for all your work Callie
Lesson here: Don't go after Mori when she gives good advice in a polite way... Because she'll stomp you..
Well, now I know what song to listen to when I get on Ace Combat or War Thunder. Great singing, our Queen of Death :D
I was so close giving up on my goals and this reminded me I must not.
Fuckin love Calli's music so much. Absolutely one of my favourite Holos
Yoooooooooooooooo
There is still a problem i have with a lot of your songs, i feel like your voice is completly overshadowed by the instrumental. Just out of curiosity i wonder how it would sound if your voice would be as loud or maybe even louder than the instrumental, cuz i kinda strugle to understand the lirics. Cool song tho, keep it up.
She wicked and that's so hardcore about her🤘
LET'S FUCKING ZOOM TO 1M VIEWS IN LESS THAN 24H GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
"Ya want a balanced following? Then start creating, stop tweeting"  *Vtweeters: I FOUND THIS EXTREMELY OFFENSIVE AND IT HURTS MY FRAGILE PRIDE!!!!*
God dammit Calli VTweeters really be pissing you off? Another masterpiece per usual.
owo
we need an osu map for this
I just think she’s neat
obligatory "this hits harder than my dad's belt" comment
The flame that faintly wavers  Stains the brain with flavor The kind of pain that you complain about then learn to savor Calli and kiara even in her songs Flamrs yhat faintly waver just as a Phoenix  Stains the brain with flavor like good food (poor poor kfp workers making good food for no pay) She complains about kiara but loves her anyway Jesus  Btw I'm just sharing this cause I thought it was interesting and was a brainworm
Calli can live on my head as long as she wants...
Cover better make her this one when she gets a new costume.
Everyone needs something they're passionate about. Motivation is great and all but if you're only ever productive when you're feeling motivated then you're never going to get any work done. Pick your scythe up, start swinging and just imagine where you will be a year from now if you keep it up.  Thank you Calli for another great song. I'm never gonna stop swinging my scythe.
Congratulations for 1 million subs
Tough love huh... So that was what I needed to get back to drumming. Thank you for this amazing song.
YAY
I swear I have heard this voice somewhere else
I can't believe this is from someone who used to not like rap. Calli, YOU'RE SO GOOD AT WHAT YOU DO. GODDAMN, GIRL.
Perish in obscurity or put everything on the line and die trying.  Calli's song is this generation's "Lose Yourself" and it will be a reminder of her passion and what it takes to reach the top
I just got destroyed
Calli really showing us some tough love here.  Kudos to her.
This song is amazing!
I-
This song is amazing!!!!!
💯💯
“Start creating, stop tweeting” *Salty VTweeters would like to know your location*
Fire department is working overtime today.🔥🔥🔥
OBJECTIVE UPDATED:  _SURVIVE_
Wow Calli nice
“Kinda wished to talk to you” gave me so much motivation. I’m working on a VTuber model and haven’t even started a Twitter yet. Hope I will not bore this queen because I want my head intact lol
I would like to see a duet from Cali and Takayan.
i love that dubstep-ish base!!! Absiolute banger as always Calli <3
Dont mind me if I use "For the glory" song to withstand when you swinging till the sunrise   Bring it on!! I shall accept any challenge or blow from the Shinigami itself
Another Banger
Love the direct take on the drama surrounding this new wave of amateur vtubers. The thing is, there is a huge surge of vtubers on the trail of the success Hololive has had, but they're the extreme toxic type. They see the success, the money, the numbers, but they forget all the effort, soul, personality and stress that went there to achieve it. It's like when your fat, bitter people shame the skinny ones, forgetting that they hit the gym every day for hours, struggle, then maybe dine with some broccoli and a carrot while they fill their mouths with chips, junk food and big macs. It's hypocritical, really. No wonder she wants them to thrive, the good ones, but she also has to be rough and say things the way they are. The sayers will keep saying and being failures, while the doers will have the inspiration to go forward.
like who here befo 1 mil views
this is a great song, been listening to it on repeat since it came out.
The dislikes are from bandwagoning twitter-bound pre-debuts     Living in their 3:32 rent free
Another great song!
As a rhythm gamer, these are the ways I see about this song:  > probably a hell SV map in literally any mania games > bunch of 4× and 1× speed in Geometry Dash (if this song is on newgrounds lol)  > some long ass spaced jump tech map in osu!  > probably a bit easier in taiko or muse dash > Cytus II.... idk man... but maybe collab in the future?  > Maybe a lot of bunched up notes in beat saber  (Any other rhythm games/music games I missed?)
Eh, still bottom of the EN tier list in my heart.
I loveee :0
Put up or shut up, vtweeters.
I won't lie, this song is actually helping me break out of a terrible creative rut. I need to heed this song's message, get off my ass, and finally put some music out there. Thanks for the tough love, Calli.
I NEED this on Spotify NOWWWWW
It feels like an Overwatch character (prob tracer) rap song from like 2016. All over the place but, still slaps
People saying she has a ghost writer, I mean she is the Grim Reaper I'm sure she has a ghost writer, a ghost butler, and a ghost bartender as well all on the payroll.
track AOは古のニコラップファン達もにっこり
ahhhh calli do the thing best soul reaper that i know
i think its damm amazing how you just are able to just... make good songs! Its honestly amazing!
Wait. She is holding a whisker away mask .      *I predict more weebs to come in hololive after the neko reaper with boing boings*
the sadistic sakura bit is an aural orgasm. jesus that sounds good.
wow
my mom said this is Satan's music,, pog
This makes me imagine a mountaintop youkai Calli that switches between the two faces of cryptic rap-speak motivator and the trash-talking tough loving face who teaches with a sudden duel
VTweeters will remember that
I bet we can get this to 1,000,000 by 24 hours. Who's doing their part to make this happen?
For many years Cali has been perfecting the art of lifting people up by fucking DESTROYING them with her lyrics and this is just the culmination of the most powerful forces in the underworld raising all us dead beats up to get us creative, get us active, get us supportive, or get us silent. It's so powerful and poetic because it's such a raw and encouraging way to tell your fanbase "you got this! I did it, so can you!" It gets in your head and STICKS. I wholeheartedly believe there will never be another being who can touch her at this point. Absolutely incredible vocalist and lyricist.
How to reap soul Calliope Style.
As a general rule, female rappers are a menace to society...  But I like Mori-san, so I'm okay with this.
新譜来た！と思ったらAOの文字見えて卒倒するかと思った…！
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
fire
Mate this song fire af🔥🔥👌👌❤❤
no idea why i thought of the apex legends pathfinder boxing arena because of this
Just a reminder: You can get this song on Spotify
Wow this song started even before I click on the video
if u yk her past this song kinda hits a bit different she put in that work and got diminishing returns she left all that hard work for more fame. was her turn to eat and she took it ....lowkey respect that man this song kinda sounds like a tribute to that
I don't even listen to rap. I think this might be her best track yet.
amazing song as always
step on me mommy
This woman just single handedly slayed all the v tweeters, amazing song
I’m so sad I missed the premier. FeelsBadMan
Another killer track. I’m surprised I haven’t died from the fact that every song you’ve released has been incredible
Should have named the song Sadistic Sakura, but a catchy tune regardless
275 jealous haters were left hanging on that high five.
very good simp for u
Calli didn't just kill the haters, she straight up slaughtered their entire race
amazing but why is there 190 people that have disliked it :(
First time i see a Grim Reaper kill a lot of people with a mic .
This is epic
Be honest, you've listened to this song more than once, haven't you?
Welp.......my house is on flames right now😐
damn boi... nice song
DAAMMMNNNNNNN🔥🔥🔥 Love it!!!!!
😍😍🌋🌋Another Fire
...Well, this song was absolutely killer. Probably my favorite so far to be honest.
PUT IT ON APPLE MUSIC!!! NOWWWWW!!
Why isn't it on spotify anymore  this is like a drug to me I need it while rocking bedwars
やっぱりかっこいいし怖いけどかわいい❤
I like this song. I really do. Keep making songs.
Bro
Pretty good
Calli packin' some heat.
to much echo
The music is dope, but god do I want Calli to have the clothes she have in the art as a costume
I need this on Spotify cali
my color blind eyes just got blasted with who knows what colors are in this video
pure fireeeee  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm sorry but I I can't help but hear:  "Welcome to the melon top"
Shots fired to those Vtweeters  Too bad they can’t fire back because they can’t create content that can match this....oops 🤭
This beat actually goes hard asf ngl, but im a sucker for really bassy beats
Calli: Welcome to the mountaintop Me: *Destiny 2 Vietnam Flashback*
That Last Verse really reminds me of the last rap battle in 8 Mile
I suggest Toy Pianos by SharaX ;cover version by Meltberry
Alright pops, I think this song finally got something through.  You're not our dad.  You're our Kamina.  You want to believe in us.  You want us to go beyond you.  And many of us can if we stick to it after taking those first steps.    Thanks, Aniki.
Okay this is epic
Dang I wasn't expecting a call out post! But hey, people gotta put in the work if they Wannabe like you.
Can someone do this background like a live Wallpaper for pc?
Bro I'm literally going to hell listening to this. The fire is real
Bow down before the queen of death
I dont like this song     He is lying
I broke my neck head banging to this and am currently in an ICU
She's going hard. damn
I really love this song calli! Great job, hope you enjoy your day ❤
Slaughtered, shredded, destroyed, never to return. LETS GO CALLI KILL EM’ WOOOOOOO!!
This disstrack is so motivational it probably started more careers than it ended. Sasuguh Calli.
Not to be rude... but this literally sounds like a fnaf song.
I need more beats from you that hit harder than a metal baseball bat to the ankles.
I want that base  Is I N F E R N A L
zero two calli
Hey, Mori, not sure you'll ever see this, but I need to tell you something. I've been wanting to create since I was barely a teenager. Before, even. I always struggled with motivation, and a big part of it was a belief that was drilled into me that creating on youtube wasn't a real job, or that I'd never be able to make a successful comic, and that all the people out there like you were exceptions, not the rule. I went to engineering school for 2 and a half years, convincing myself I was happy with something I didn't enjoy, until I had a mental breakdown and had to switch majors. I haven't been the same since then. I've had intense anxiety and my depression has gotten worse. It sometimes feels like all I can do to put in 10 hours a week at the grocery store and take 6 credits of classes. And that took me 2 years of recovery to build up to. I've been picking away at my passions during that time, but it's been slow.  I don't know what it is, but there's something about you and your lyrics that speaks to me. I feel like we've felt some of the same things, and it means a lot to me seeing you succeed. And the lyrics of this video really reached me, I want you to know. I don't know how long it'll be till I have it in me to 'swing till the sunrise' so to speak, but I'm getting better every day. And I think this song is going to help.  Just wanted you to know that you're making a difference in my life.
Damn, this straight fire Calli!
Is no one gonna talk about how awesome her Kimono looks?
500K in 13 hr !!!
She's really doing away with the cheerleader delivery and I couldn't be more proud
Okay, that meow is just flat out disturbingly accurate, I keep thinking my cat is talking to me and telling me to do things.
500k! Keep it going beats!
2:31 - "Easy for your to say" is presumably a typo. Sickass track, though the end feels like it's a buildup with no cash-out...although maybe that's on purpose, like the people it targets?
<3
beat is sick
heh.... it seems our beloved tsun-reaper reaps those people akin to colony drop on those vtwitters
want that instrumental. this song is good.
"Then start creating, stop tweeting"   Message to certains TBD
So cool!! imma put this on repeat
This is what happens when the "g" falls off the graveyard sign
This is litt🔥
so... no head????
I want this on spotify ksnxjekskkwkskhshsj
Calli: I'm a reaper on hiatus. Also Calli: Off with their heads. FYI you can still murder ppl with only your words. Exhibit A: The pile of what's remaining of all your haters on the mountaintop. I didn't realize the Deadbeat training arc included public massacres to motivate us. If I know what's good for me next time I feel unmotivated to work toward my goals I'll listen to this song and keep swinging until I enjoy the pain. This song makes me hyped for all the songs you keep mentioning are in the works.  🗡🗡🗡🗡
Bruh why she murder twitter?😱 I thought the reaper was on hiatus 😤🤔
I've been playing this on repeat all day and the more I listen, the more the song gets better!  Also after the recent stream I can't help but imagine a cardboard Calli rapping this song
I'm getting a Premonition: *Callie doing collab with BabyMetal*
The piercing metallic snare feels like a fucking hammer piledriving each word into your skull like a stake. Emblazoning her advice into your brain. Percussive tough love at its finest. A new form of percussive maintenance on the potential of people perhaps?
🔥🔥🔥🔥
"I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced." - RIP  VTweeters probably wheneva Feb 1 2021
I’m curious now,if anyone can make this masterpiece of a track even better.
It's a slaughter 😼
I believe the dislikers is overcooked
かっけぇなぁ。
Girl you can have my head idc
Feels like a naruto fight was when listening to this🔥🔥🔥
I'm gonna watch this with my Bois
This is going to be on spotify too?
Man, I wanna buy this. Why can't I buy this
A really amazing song! You made my day, thank you :')
Wait, I thought Calli retired from reaping souls from people? I see a lot of bodies dropping to the ground after the Jigoku Kawaiii and Badass fire was dropped with this song.  It is really hype to listen to it, and whats best, its pure, straight facts!!  Keep going strong, hardworking reaper Queen!  No... Lets ALL OF US keep going strong :D
On hiatus but still making wannabes feel the sweet embrace of death herself.
Soooo COOL! 🔥🔥🔥
カリオペのラップ毎回カッコイイからすき
probably my fav song from reaper
This not only feels like an amazing original song, but also a diss track which is AMAZING
THHKと組んで最高じゃないはずがない！
I want FBK-sensei to sing this
If you're iffy about the lyrics, check the description!!! Calliope isn't targeting people who have things spiraling out of control (as many have experienced in this pandemic, depressing times and all). She's aiming to motivate people who have lost their passion / have never had that passion in the first place.
Yo she just roasted the 3d womans
Damn this slaps, could be my new fav from you!
Perfection
May we have a ten hour version of this?
This is a banger.
CALLI I HAD TO USE MY TOASTER TO COMMENT BECAUSE THIS SONG MELTED MY PHONE
Hello everyone, welcome to Calli shows no chill and spits facts and fire, enjoy your stay
wait im confused what is the genre?
Imagine getting heart from her 💚
....maybe I should cutting corners in uni.
That sensei bar and the follow up with the rhyming scheme for the next few bars was fucking God Tier, death tier?  Anyway the internal rhyming is amazing and this is another bop
Flashing lights and eyestrain warning would be nice, but otherwise, another Calli Classic.
"Dead beats swinging now, grab the scythe and show them how!!"  Wow.. This sounds so incredibly clean
You have legit become my new favorite rapper. I find a lot of rap to be either too simple or not melodic enough, but you hit the sweetspot perfectly. It's catchy, its intelligent and it has so much style to it, I just love it!
I get Swan Song Hollywood Undead vibes from this and I love it
Calli, I absolutely love the track but my living room has been in flames since it caused my PC to combust. Please warn us about these side effects next time
So... Calliope when you gonna get the illustration in this song cover as a model for streaming? Would be sick to see
her best vocal performance by far imo
I feel like some of the lyrics are directed to twitter wannabe-Vtubers.
A few months ago-: She's cute...her debut was cute. I'll watch her...  Now-: *No words*
Damn
We need this on Spotify dawg, anywho Love the song
Em fakes are shaking so bad
I love this song. I LOVE IT SO MUCH. Good job moripe
I cant wait for the remixes
Calligod
I'm not a great fan of Calli, but daaaaaaaamn son, this song is fire!!!   "You want a balanced following? Then start creating, stop tweeting This ain't me hatin', i'm just bored from all the talkers im beating..."  That's it... You got my respect, lady.
やっぱカッコイイなぁ
This sounds like an old fnaf song
毎回毎回すごいわくわくする曲をありがとう！！！((o(｡>ω<｡)o))
3D debut teaser
A diss track to surpass No Vaseline
Ahhhhhhh this is weird some of the lyrics are just not in place?
LETS GO DEAD BEATS
Best diss track in history??
Here a message for the vtweeters and some people that saying they are vtuber but almost or maybe having no content or art  2:00 to 2:07   Mori Saying a fact
Does anyone know if/when this song will be available on spotify?
For anyone who would understand this, this was perfectly timed for motivation for the Monty Oum project
Congratulations for the 1M suscribes😘🥳🤯💀
You finally got back your throne with this AMEzing track
Nice 👌
Calling out all the "creators" for being lazy lol. I actually never heard such immense tough love in any song, basically telling us to really do our best if we want to achieve our dreams. Sasuga Calli, this song is kinda like a wake up call for me, thanks.
OMG! Is this on spotify yet??
Someone make a this in wallpaper engine
Nice, new song;o Wish the production was slightly different tho. Her voice should be more on the foreground
This is great! How long til its on spotify?
YOSHAAAAA
Her rapping style reminds me of Dan bull xd
eminem 2.0
Damn she really is a reaper , cause she just killed it.
Take my head too coz you already take my heart~
I need the no vocal version 🔥
DAMNNNNNNN!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I should write more.
This one is so doooope!
This is absolute fire 🔥🔥🔥
Oh this is so good ...... ok Amelia your next
えぇカッコよすぎる
Good song!
かっけぇ
COOOOOOOOOOL！！！！！！！  I  LOVE YOUUUUUUU！！！！！
This is so good!
Love it, not only her "hngahh" but also her song. Basically everything about her :V
Can anyone else not find it on streaming sites?
Calli say she can play dark souls!
AWESOME 🔥🌹🔥🌹🔥🌹🔥🌹
God dang this is savage.  Absolute fire again!! 🔥🔥🔥 Another BANGER of a song.
When will this be on Apple Music? This song is amazing!
I heard "Rip and tear"... that was kind of sad for me that she's not playing Eternal anymore
hey calli , not sure if u hav see this , but hav u see a fanart of u with short hair
For someone who’s been to countless hardcore dubstep concerts this song is now my favorite song from calli period
All the dislike are from people who can't take innuendo or teasing or something (my english sucks)
oops gotta buy new headphones, i wanna hear this masterpiece clearer
Hoo boy, this is an instant favorite! Great work once again, Calli.
So no head?
Snapped for no reason 🗣🔥
for some reason having this on repeat makes playing Nioh 2 so much easier 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
yo
I love this
This may be seen as a diss track, but personally I took it to heart as an artist encouraging other artists to keep working and don't stop even if the results don't show
She's got a perfect counterpoint.  When you do start swinging, you realize what you're truly fighting for.  Started writing for the sake of writing. Now I got my pen for a sword and I ain't backing down anytime soon. Probably never will.
CALL AN AMBULANCE  BUT NOT FOR ME
dope I'll follow you forever Cali.
Finally content for my heart
Mori stop.. they're already dead..
G O D  T I E R
It good when it can roast and Motivate at the same time!
Absolute 🅱️anger
Oh damn this is 🔥
Yesss Japanes style
Sometimes you just need a little bit of tough love, thanks dad
Can't spell "grave" without "rave"!
Can I like a video twice
Mori stay droppin BANGERS, keep up the amazing work!
kokolochan!？year.good!
I can't specify why but for some reason it's much harder for me to follow the lyrics this time, even If I'm literally reading them
Calli... How? Explain pls.
DOPE BASED SUPERLIT! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I should really start researching other countrys rap cultures, all I know was the awful german rap and it brough me to be a metal egdelord but this kind of rap is really nice, love it ❤️
You truly are The Real Grim Shady
This is so effing fire, time to loop this one.
This is what the youth called the 'Lit,' correct?
So.... anyone keeping any headcounts? This is still the start of the slaying and already 242 heads rolled.
I didn't even know the captions dod karaoke style highlights
What a tune! 🤘
Is this gonna be on spotify?
Dunno whether skull is made of the densest thing on earth but I didn't get the message from the song o(TヘTo)
I was thinking - "Wow, what an exhaustingly long rhyme sequence!"  There was another 1:30 left in the song.  Seriously impressed.
Incredible
Come here scru face jean I need a break down
But but but .... She is a shinigami ??
SO GOOD the traditional creepy vibe reminds me a bit of the fox's wedding. i love it sm
"大企業の箱入り娘"って言う輩は腐るほどいるだろうけど、今までの苦労と経験と実力で徐々に黙らせていく死神かっこよすぎる
🔥 GUH 🔥
This Grim Reaper just renewed my will to live
Why does this remind me so much of Akagi from Azur lane?
Don't pop off too hard now holy 🔥
This is cheif kiss
Another banger!
ahhh this song make our dog transform to kurama
Great song, Calli!
Awesome track! Lyrics were fire and the mix/production was incredible. Loved the mix-ups on the beat and different styles being showcased. Loved it!
Holy that is🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
damnn calli you slaughter every vtuber indie right now idk what happen next i want to see more challanger appear to challange you
Damn Girl.
Scru react to this please
sakaguchi ango approb!! 👏👏👌👌
I really don't like this Saint's row 4 dubstep gun music
山の翁「首を出せ」 King Hassan: Offer thine head カリちゃん「首をはねる」 Calli: Off with your head  Same energy
Another great song by Mori! ❤❤
СМЕРТЕЛЬНАЯ музыка !!!!
My eyes have been opened
Calli, you may not see this, but I want to say it anyway. You are the reason that I have been working hard on improving myself. I have set a goal of getting into Hololive, but I keep hitting setbacks. I am a guy who can't sing, draw, or do really anything you do on a daily basis. I began to settle for less, saying that I just need to do the bare minimum to succeed. I began thinking of ways to get in without actually doing anything, because I didn't want to get the criticism that comes with not being perfect. Your song is now serving as the motivation to get better so that maybe, one day, I can join you and everyone in Hololive.
I was waiting for a new song! Calli thank you!
FOR THE UNDERWORLD!
Fun song I really like it! Only thing I could really criticize is maybe add a flashing lights warning.
oh fantastic song my queen of the underworld Calli I am just a poor soul or a poor human who will be carried only by you.
Thanks Calli... I'll get that trophy.
Just finished a 2 week animation challenge and after putting in so many hours, this was a great reward. Sure, I'll take up my sword and keep swinging till the sunrise. I've got a lot more to create and share! Let's get this party started.
If they don't play this on my deathbed then I refuse dying
I click  I hear  It's Cool It's Reminding me Of Something That was too nostalgic  And it was FNAF.
......ǫᴎoꙅ ɘʜƚ ɘvo|
ZALUPA!
"The Ringer" but anime.
The big jammers
Oriental calliope is making my head spin
It's sounds a bit different but I still love it
This goes hard
This has a Kpop feel lol I love it!!
"I have arrived, and it is now that I perform my charge. In fealty to Hololive and by the grace of my idol-rapper throne, I declare Exterminatus upon the world of Twitter Primaris.  I hereby sign the death warrant of an entire community and consign a million souls to oblivion.  May common sense account in all balance. Yagoo is best girl." - Inquisitor Calliope Mori, Ordo Necros
The 235 dislike are the people pissed about the "Start Creating, Stop tweeting"
Now that's a beat!
100万人おめでとう！！！ 最高だよ、、、
Calli: my next song will be aggressive The song: rough but motivating
Death always deliver....err.. I mean slays...uh... cutting heads. Have my head Queen. I apologize in advance for a low quality head tho.
ok please tell me.... DOES ANYONE ELSE GET DEMONDICE FEELS!?
I don't know why but I can picture this song on Cytus and I'm just vibing with it
すげぇ笑
Yagoo: Mori, is you next song going to be a brutal diss track, or a inspiring motivational song? Mori: Yes.
I just wanna say that I'm super in love with the song AND the artwork right there ❤❤❤ Keep slaying our Queen!
I raely like the rap. Goddam 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
*ahem* GUH
Calli gone and done it again 🔥
This is actually a pretty hype song for a vtuber
Okay, so first time hearing this after 1 hour release i was like "what is this, it doesnt fit my style" 2nd time i hear this i was like "guess its not bad as i think , the beat the musics and the most important is its Calli's"   Update : i forget how many times i listening to this and was about to comment it but i lost this comment in the crowd and here i am ... So yeah its banger, all of calli's song is banger, FIGHT ME!  (im gonna update the comment if i listening to this many times and start to like or probably get crazy to it)
Can confirm, both of my heads were sliced off after listening to this.
this is...revolutionary...
Wub wub so sikk yoo👊
A Banger is not the word for this, it's too epic for that.
Spicy~
Calliope Kitsune? I approve.
Y'know, if you haven't read the description in the video, do it. This song is both to inspire those who are having a hard time and to try giving a push to those who are (or claim to be) just starting.  I'm going to add this to my motivational playlist between "Nevah give up!" and "JUST DO IT".
Jesus, I needed this fire with the snowstorm hitting where I live.
I woke up this morning and didn't expect to be lit on fire
i dig the asian vibes,the techno beats and the marvelous rapping ^u^
かっこよすぎる…
The beat hits so fucking hard<<<<<3
しゅごい
Yankiee Calli!
Words
She sings Rip'n'Tear but still didnt finish Doom  Even tho this song is hotter than Hell and kills better than demons
that was amazing OMG! i like how most of the song was just a fuck you to the haters
2:04 Calli basically told the truth.  *'Ya want a balanced following? Then start creating, stop tweeting'* I actually didn't even realise that part until I kept listening and found out lol.
holy
I swear... if I listen to this song 10 more times, I will be completely exhausted... ... oh well...
That snare 😳
Oof those Vtweeters got 7 degree burn.
Bro Calli's vocals are a given but that instrumental is absolutely insane holy
I feel like i'm being abducted into a cult, idfc tho, Calli can decapitate me
Looking forward with a rap collab between Calli and Fubuki.
Lyrics: FIRE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 FIRE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 FIRE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 FIRE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥  just watch the video -.-
I can't stop appreciating how sick these rhyme are.
if mori is calling out anyone it’s to the cheaply made vtweeter disguises. best believe it’s drama. the point is to do your reps.
thats materials
now i have a new calli song to loop over and over again for weeks!!! ugh maam youre too cool 💖💖💖
信じられない！
Yo 😳😳😳
So when this gonna be in spotify?
Damn. That slaps hard. 🙌🏽
ha ha ja ja das der loopen buttonen göes brrrrrrr-
not the kind of music I usually listen to but holy cow this is too good not to.
My nearest firefighter after this heat dropped :        *yabai nee*
Dad's out here handing out discipline to the children
Goddamn I love aggressive Calli.
Mountain tops are pretty cool
1 mil Calli is spicy
Calli literally reaped them then sent them to hell with how much she burned these "Vtuber-debut-TBA" guys XD
I heard "where we make the _panties_ drop" instead of 'bodies' ..
its not a roast, its a literal advice, a really good one at that
Artemis won the battle, Kanizawa is doin prett good, we thought Valefor would maek it but male vtuber just dont work out. pray for our bois
Well this is the perfect motivator for an otherwise tiring Monday morning!
Yep, they ded
Calli be bringing the RAVE in "graveyard"
>calli wears yuusuke's mask
Spotify Please ane ~
"Ya want a balanced following? Then start creating, stop tweeting" _The underworld is not responsible for the L's you just received_
But without head, they will become Dullahan
HELL YEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH
"Cuz truthfully y'all lose the heat when seein ' no traction " How to explain f1 car be like
Can we get that Outfit in 3D for Calli pls?
I love how its both calli giving shinigami lessons and a clap back at Vtweeters     And that picture is fucking great, “welcome to the mountain top” is going to be a meme like the classic *welcome to the rice fields*
Why views stopping at 433105？
Amazing vibe. And thise lyrics. She’s really taking heads with this song.
Yes!!!!!!!!! good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dear god this is awesome I love it ^0^
I need a version with Calli voice louder than the music. I love Calliope but I think the music is too high so I can't hear the lyrics. Pls someone help me to enjoy this song as the rest of the world.
I love u Calli, that's all.
I had an ad after it switch over. I've been here so long, the two minute countdown timer has been removed. Then, I had to pause it. You know I rewind it so I can have the uninterrupted flow.
Mori calliope tolong bilang ke vtuber yg bernama Maya suruh upload video lagi🙏😭😭 kangen maya
255 are the ones she is talking about lulz
Nothing...Just     Leave my comment here! ❤️
hopefully one day she collab with a certain Elite called Sakura >_<
Ya'll better back off from our Queen or Dead Beats gonna swarm the earth like the million titans in the walls
I love that she used "scythe swinging lessons" lore! :D
the english language doen't have the words to describe my feeling for this song. So let me try german:  Ballert!
feels like i wanna remix this track
THE QUEEN IS BACCKKKK WITH FIRREEEE
Take my head
yes, a million people subscribed just for the meme
Gonna have this on repeat all day
Love this song
Other hologirls: "You are king" Calli: "Off with your head" Me: I'm beginning to see a pattern here that I'm pretty sure I like
GG gaming 🤘🤘🔥🔥😍
damn! the reaper just made another cool beat, i love it and that's a nice kimono
Cool song
God fucking damn that was lit. It has my favorite type of melody and the rhymes where sick as fuck, this is my new favorite.
Automatic Head Bangers. 🤟🏼💀👍🏼 Love You Mention Sadistic Sakura 😈🌸
Owowowo
Nice! I like it! 👍
Mori and Eminem duo when?
It's just banger after banger after banger. She really dont miss
2:04 YOOOOOO SHE FUCKING WENT THERE
If I played this in my friend's house and it burned down, would I get charged with arson?
calliope out here making a diss track to all those twitter haters and disguising it as "just an original song"
I don't get it. I don't understand what the song is about.
I will be honest this song bags but the title is a bit of a miss.
So what else is coming off.. Firstly yubis.. now our heads..
WOO SWING BEAT HELL YEAH
Sexy art love it
take me and kill me queen i dont wanna suffer anymore
SO COOL !!
Cool!!!!
DECAPITATE ME MOMMY
Take my *wig*, Take my *head*, take my *money*.  All yours, queen!!!
I've never oof'ed so hard when the Vtweeters burn came up, there's no way they can recover after that.
OMG!! EPIC!!! ❤
WOW, What a wonderful song!  I love this song very much. Mori Calliope我的唯一死神，我會繼續支持你的
Lol when I saw the credits I actually though, "Man, the Ancient Ones got some serious talent other than modding for Ina, who knew?" I should read things twice lol.
thank you Calli for giving me infinite inspiration.
amazing song, good job !
Oof, lots of heads be rolling
No matter how much change you have in your life, or have different identities you have, you're still the best, old fan here. We still support ya, i wasn't sure before but now i am.
This beat hits hard...
The chorus has such a good flow and I love it
This is the first song I've heard from Calli, is this a good start?
トラックAOさんかよ！最高か！
かっこよ
相変わらずカッコいいって言おうとしたけど適切ではなかった。        今まで以上にカッコいい///
Kiara is getting lazy. Didn't comment on Calli's new song before Ollie.
how many time has you guys listen to this? this is the 5th time for me
Public Execution Debut TBA.
why beginning reminds me the chorus "The Art of Darkness"....
Me on the outside: oh a new song, I love her music so much!  Me on the inside: Kyaaaaaa Calli-samaaaaaa!! <3
getting mad masa works vibes from the background pic
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
SHEEESH
Take my head queen
うわぁぁぁぁぁあぁぁ▂▅▇█▓▒░(’ω’)░▒▓█▇▅▂ ジャンル変わらないけど、日本の音楽調、こういうのでもラップできるのかあああああああああ▂▅▇█▓▒░(’ω’)░▒▓█▇▅▂ ありがとうございまざいます😍 ありがとうございまざいます😍 ありがとうございまざいます😍
Fuck, I just realized that Calli's hair looks like a red spider lily in this, which is associated with death and the afterlife especially in Eastern cultures.
“Easy for you to say little miss company hire” OOOOFFFFFFFFFF
God dayum
Our boi spitting cold facts and straight fire.
"Send them away Death Sensei. No ambition. Try again next week"  This just shows how your given more time to change and reach your dreams before you've done your purpose  Damn the art really shows her Dangerous Beauty. Really says "follow me DeadBeats and succeed"
dang it got real literal near the end lol I was trying to find the meaning in the lyrics at the start but it really got spelled out near the end kek Not that it's necessarily a bad thing, especially if you wanna make sure the right message gets across - and it gives a lot more insight to all the lyrics on second hearing which is pog it's not really targeted towards me specifically, but as a creative I can still kinda relate to some of the stuff it calls out lol. tough to hear, but something I need to hear every now and then to keep me on track eh
才能の塊、、 Spotifyの配信感謝します Love
I hope I can use one of your music in my future anime
DAMN DUDE, this girl is FIRE!!!!
♥️♥️♥️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Alright, this song is amazing. Calli totally surpassed herself with those lyrics, there's Eminem Songs with simpler Rhyme patterns and Lines, and rapping over a beat like this oughta be incredibly hard
The Queen of Death takes no prisoners!
This is def Calli’s best song!
why does youtube keep unsubscribing me from your channel ffs... every single time i subscribe  it just reverts
Damn, look at your fans! You burned them!
This isn't a diss track, it's a straight up MASSACRE  I love it
I didn't even know you could do that with YouTube subtitles
Jesus Christ Cali, you just destroyed an entire platform in seconds.
Best song i've ever heard. Good job!
YES!! YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!!!!
Why does Calli now look like a Persona character?
almost 500k views in half a day, let's go
This motivation speech hits me in two different ways. lol  If you’re talking about my Japanese-learning journey. I’m doing great, thanks for the motivation I’ll keep going.  If you’re talking about my actual job I am paid for.... then.... hum...
COOL
Ok can someone explain the context of all the vtweeter stuff relating to cali
Does it on spotify?
Our boy really does spoil us tho 💀
Say it louder!
Ah sheeesh, another banger im dead
This song will now be on repeat for a long time. Great work!
かっこよ！
Can’t wait for this to be in Apple Music 🥰
Notice me and I will eat soap:>
You’re telling me Ina’s book made this beat? 😳
Please take my head my queen
"Take up the sword and swing it until it is unbearable, and wear your scars with dignity, when showing something shareable" Some god damn poetry in motion right here, probably the bar that hit the hardest for me. Also digging the rasp at the end there, wouldn't mind a track with that sound either.
loosing your head has never been cooler
this sounds like a diss on someone  and it might be enough to start another forest fire
I feel like the vocals could be louder, no hate tho, still like it
FUCKII8NG INSANE DONT STOP !!!!
having something like this on wallpaper engine would be so lit
I like the beat and the song is great  Great song. Another one on my list of songs that I listen to
This also goes very nicely with a quote from my favourite streamer the other day: "You say you've fallen down the mountain, but you've not made it to the top yet. You've fallen off a tree at most so stop exaggerating"
What even is this beat
[Witty comment that shows that I am funny but also enjoy the song]
Great song I actually set an alarm a 9pm for this song..... I was at work lmao.  Then when I woke up straight back here.
Every calli song is good
Daaaammmnn. diss track is 🔥🔥🔥
More than my wig was stolen on this day
Ooh, this was a banger!
Is it on Spotify
Ok my scythe is raised now, point me to my target. Holy moly what a song.
Take my head
omg
The aiiii at 0:46 is blessed.
Yes, I give you my head. More please
take my head, my soul any body was your's. my queen
カッコよ！
Challenge accepted, way to light a fire under us smaller folks. Spitting facts.
Amazing rap once again
Damnnn this slaps
Walking around with this song in my earphone, now im in the cemetery, another dead end FUCK!!
Is it time... for Calli to give us scythe swinging lessons?
take my head, queen.
Queen!Queen!You are a fcking Queen👑
this is awesome i got my scythe                                                  _________)
和と融合したラップめっちゃ好物
This is one of the greatest things I’ve ever heard.
It's Prospero all over again!  But for real, this song is awesome! Hats off! Or should I say, head's off
she holds so much power that she dissed an entire community
Damm
Amelia been real quiet since this dropped.
Community engagement
Graveyards are looking pretty good lately
Sounds like she said "Welcome to the melontop" lol
Oh we're dead
🔥🔥🔥 this video deserve more likes!!
I kinda like the idea of pushing myself even though I'm a "deadbeat" lol
I want her tough love
The style reminds me of icon for hire band
Don't be afraid to slow down and then speed back up. You don't have to be arrested to the backbeat.
歌詞追えてないけど普通に食らう クソかっこいい
This really surprised me, the beat was something else!  Keep it up with your fire!
Fire 🔥
Cut the chorus out and set it as new ringtone.  Damn nice track miss reaper.
Dicey!
Hang on, AO-chan is Tophamhatkyo? What is this, a crossover episode?
Dude, KFP is gonna catch on fire with all this heat🔥🔥🔥
🔥 Absolutely Lit🔥
I'm someone who loves to listen to the instrumental parts of songs but the lyrics are wonderful. Scru needs to react so I can know more in-depth
i like the song.
Start creating, stop twitting    Dude stop stop they're already dead xD
anyone got this wallpaper on wallpaper engine yet? is sicc
And that’s another song added to my mori playlist :)
This song is cold hard truth, Calli has really worked long and hard for her spot on the mountain. Too many people expect just to be handed the fruits of hard labor without the labor. This is a kindness from her to all the people who think they deserve a following for doing nothing. Keeped fighting, based reaper!
the more i look at Calli in the video the more i want her to step on me, thats…weird huh…meh
the more i look at Calli in the video the more i want her to step on me, thats…weird huh…meh
I'M BURNING I'M BURNING!!!
My eyes are burning!!!
Audiophile Heaven recommends this <3
WELCOME TO THE MOUNTAIN TOP!
oh yeah baby 😎
She has musical scale magic
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
These are the hottest bars so far, fuckin fire.
Soooooo nice😎
Hey! wassup Scru if you're watching this lmao
Want it in OSU!
Mama, papa is roasting people again
This song goes so Hard. Cali you are an inspiration to so many. Keep it up
This is fucking lit
Rap is one of my least favorite style of music, yet I find myself enjoying all of Calli's song.
King?
Okay. No Vtweeting now. Now I am starting career as Von't.
Dude, the beat is fucking sick, the wordplay flows really well, and to top it off it is an orbital strike on the Vtweeter communities that keep flaming EN and hololive in general??  And the ART! Beautiful! is there a wallpaper DL for it?? 10/10, have on repeat.
Kitsune mask and traditional kimonos look beautiful on you 🔥🔥🥰
Those lyrics are 5 layers of fire. So many stylistic devices, smart egotrip punchlines. I had to listen to it 6 times in a row before I could grasp how technical that text is.
🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥  damn it's hot🔥
My head is yours, my queen. TAKE IT
Yeah! you tell them queen !!
What a song, A banger on top of some lessons to learn in it. Motivation through music is one of the greatest things and this is one of my favorite ones.
She's Dissin' those Vtweeters real hard Damn thats hot as hell
If only it slapped just a little more
ブラボー
PLS ADD THIS TO SOUNDCLOUD
That look and outfit really looks good on her
The illustration makes me feel like rolling some gacha xD  price is probably my head
Demondice?
Another masterpiece going to my playlist!
This song gives me fnaf vibes, ITS GUD
Feel like Demondice
Sasuga Calli-sama as always a banger song.
The music is too loud the vocals should be louder but great song.
0:40 she rlly said “ i live in ur head rent-free “ nd it is so true
WOOO  LOUDER FOR THOSE AT THE BACK
Sad that most Vtubers will sooner get offended than act on your advice :)
I was vibing until she addressed the vtweeters.   then I laughed hard and continued vibing.
Calli's new track is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Starting follow Vtubers, the best choice of my entire life.
Damn she slayin' hard again, how many of people's heads has she been reaping just from this alone
casually flexing that 1m sub count
"Naughty Boy's and girls get chopped"  All the men and women of culture: *Oh Sh*t* OR *As long as its an anime girl its ok.*
this diss track causes haters to destruct
The dislikes are the VTweeters who got offended.
Everybodys gangsta till that one guy bass boosts this to 100
これが和洋折衷ですか！
Calli so good at rapping she stole ollie from rushia.
I love the art
This would be fun to put over a FNAF Mep
ABSOLUTE FIRE🔥🔥🔥 BURNS LEFT AND RIGHT 💀. Fukkin amazing, sasuga Reaper-sensei.
This slaps
Dope EPICCC BOII
And she says she is just an apprentice reaper
Ayo we gotta get Scru Face Jean to react to this certified banger
Is it just me or is it burning in here? 🔥 🔥 🔥
The TBA's have been real noisy since this beat dropped.
100K like goooooooo
WOOOOOOOOOO
Damn..... this songs hits really hard. Time to step up.
Yeesh, kupo! You killed those vtweeters again, kupo! You gave them advice, they don't listen, you show them how it's done, kupo.
Dadmori Calliopapa telling me to get off of my ass and start bustin'. I needed to hear this so fucking bad... It fills a hole missing in my life.... I don't think I ever replayed a song this much. Thank you, Calli.
2:06 *DAAAAMMMNMMN, THATS ABSOLUTE FIRE.* 🤙🔥🔥🤙
Fyahhhhhh.
Bruh a new Mori Song!!! What a way to kick off the morning
Mmm this is sick. Time to wear it out!
This song is inspiring me to take my sword from the wall and get back into fencing
Mountaintop? sweats in destiny 2
Oh yeah they're suppose to be idols.
Daaamn this good. Sounds awesome and I definitely get the message here. Spittin' 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sick Track 🔥. Anyone else feeling those diss track vibes? Slay em Calli nobody even comes close in this realm.
Godlike
Calli !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Really good song Calli, I always love the way your music sound this is no exception
I just saw Calli's comment on Amelia's Pop on Rocks remix . and now she made this.  *The throne is yours, queen!*
英語で和風を感じる…新しい感じがしました。
Finally,some good fucking music
Be honest,I didn’t listen rap at all.But Calli makes me love fell in love with rap!❤️
I wish those vtweeters have tag so I can avoid them
My head is yours, Calli-sama!!
Nice nice!!
Insane
Calli is like the Kratos of Vtubers
This song is 10/10 my new motivation or pep music
I'll gladly give her my soul
227 people not interested in the mountaintop. Rip...
im not really a fan when it comes to rap but if its Mori haha why not
Why is this so good though? I guess calli is swinging the scythe again BUT WITH FIRE!
I'll confess, I never truly agreed with Calli when she initally told us she believed that rap was a better vehicle of murdering people than the likes of extreme metal genres.  And then this dropped. Don't mind me, I'm just reaching for my hazmat suit while this plays on repeat.
和風とか神としか言いようがない
drop this banger on spotify queen
i'm here both for the song and the art
Ruler of demonic underground & holy shrine??  Welcome to the empire, my empress
こういうリズムはグリッチホップってやつになるのかな？
Trap style, nice!
Looking at the art while listening to the music is 🔥👌♥️
I hope to Death-sensei that one day this gets turned into a music video. Motivational videos? What are those?
This is straight 🔥🔥🔥
nice song. AetherJam AetherJam AetherJam
track mixがハム狂と聞いて聴きに来た
Ah Is this the song that got Vtweeters mad?
Vtweeters mostly use their platform to virtue signal anyway
I'm very much willing to offer my head.
I really love your other song but dang this one is so much better the improvement is incredible and you were already amazing
\o/
This one reminds me of a very specific demon.
Brrrrrrrrrrrr
This is so beautiful I'm crying Queen
When will we become ashes 😭
Ahhh time to wait for the spotify release
か、かっけぇ…
Yet another masterpiece, I'm so glad i fell down the rabbit hole,    Haters would say that this was created to insult them but for the fans and other its a strong motivational song that screams in your head "DO WHAT YOU WANNA DO" or "YOU DIDN'T EVEN START YET WHY DID YOU GIVE UP?"
i was surprised by the karaoke captions lol
Nobody's talking about it, but the editing and effects on the art is so damn good
This song...hits hard and without mercy. It may have a call out to vtweeters, but the whole message is such a good one. I spent more than a decade "writing" without ever actually producing anything. I only considered myself a hobbyist, but I felt so ashamed whenever I talked to friends or family about it since I didn't have anything to show for it. Then a good friend gave me this very message and changed my whole perspective. Thank you for this reminder, Calli; your words are encouraging.
She really went off with their heads on this one
We need an animation of this
Me: Man stop, they are already dead. Calli: You can't tell me to stop. Me: Ha! Goty! Just RIP and tear until it's done. *walks away with thumbs up and smile*
absolutely slaughtered it goddamn
Simple lads youtube > twitter time gave me right. now who's next.
2:03 my queen calliope just fucking murdered vtweeters
Thank you senpai!
I fuck with the beat heavy
Damn its feels like hearing this while playing Azurlane damn..
People saying she 'slayed' vtweeters or whomever but I think that's an antagonizing way of putting it. She said herself in the song that it's tough love/advice. My take is she wants the whole community to thrive but she thinks they aren't putting the work necessary.
Thanks Calli not only Is this a bop but also it stung but it was a good wakeup call. I've been settling for mediocrity when I know I'm capable of way more
A rare look at Calliope Mori's Scythe Swinging Lessons
This is a fucking bop.
I can already say this song is going to be on my most listened list on spotify <3
The tweet one send those schmucks good back to the basement click clacking in their PC and furiously tapping their phones until it break out of madness
What if the movie 300 was a song, and it was about online entertainment. That was a fucking slaughter.
<3
Calli might just be the most talented person in Hololive.
And so the bodies lay
I really hope this is her New Years costume, it’s fucking FIRE
Shots fiyerd
くび！くび！
This is what I subscribed for. Absolutely love your music, you're second only to eminem for me as far as rap goes and I can wait to hear more from you in the future.
Damn, death sensei now cocked, locked and canon. 😎😍🔥👌
Its very cool. It must have more likes
Based
W-why do i get woohoolad ad????
track＆mix AOくんでアガった
amazing song man, and cool message overall! <3
Haters inbound, we must destroy them!!!!!!
I like this beat a lot
This is thematically my favourite of your songs so far Calli! Keep it up goddess!
I really hope she continued to push the boundaries on the subject she talks about in the songs, so that the company feels more confident to let her speak on more real subject that people could relate to instead off just safe songs that are aimed at offending the last amount of people by not talking about subject that may be more strongly opinionated.
英語で和風とか、、、、、 最高やろ、、、、、、
It's official...the Goddess of Death sets us all ablaze by her musical prowess! She said she's apprentice of Death..but clearly she deserves to be the goddess.
Looks like Scru Face Jean would love this
Calli singlehandedly burnt all the never-debut vtweeters.
this is my reason for completing my degree next year, thanks calli
That was really sick song i love it can't wait to hear more from you your rapping is also good.
This is FIRE!!!!
I see a plot hole How are you death when only dragons spit fire like this?   I need answers
How to sum up this song in five words: "Be creative, supportive, or silent." Im going to support no matter what. I wanna see Calli on stage spitting this and even better tracks that havent been written yet. Weve inspired her and shes returning the favor, along with an Anti-hater blast. Lets keep it up and see her go even further.
Lemme borrow a guillotine from France
She actually said "I'm living in your head rent free"  Savage
What a banger! Really great job! Amazing ❤️❤️❤️ also... SAY IT LOUDER
Let's make this 1 million views in one day
PLS take my broken soul i cant live withe him   do come a spotify version of this song
In Germany we call it ''Kopfnickershit''
F◯cking cute！
Calliope is an extremely hard-working and talented vtuber. She deserves her great success. This song is wicked cool with a thoughtful message about the importance of hard work in order to fulfil one's goals BUT... let's not forget that all of the HoloEN girls reached 100k subs during their debut streams, in the very beginning of their career and everything has gone smoothly since then. This was all thanks to Hololive's status and influece. Most indie vtubers can't reach 100k subs even after months of constant effort and talent. This somewhat dilutes the video's message as far as other vtubers are concerned. It's not exactly a fair competition.
AH YESSSS!
I'd pay Calliope to live rent free in my head.
Subarashii
track by AO！！！ fake type！！！！
DAYUUUM THESE LYRICS BE BURNING PEOPLE TO CRISP
Now I'm motivated!
Damn Calli, ok!
Can someone make a 1 hour loop of this so I can work out to it?
Absolutely beautiful!
This is a fukkin banger, knocked it outa the park!! 11/10
sometimes what you have to hear ain't what you want to hear. those were some incinerating lines and i hope thepeople who need to hear them take 'em to heart.
*I love her rap,* but some of the melodies in the music are *overpowering.*  Not all the melodies, but for example: 0:57 completely being _over_ Calli and pulling attention away from her (instead of being in some interlude, for example; or being supportive) - the melody at 0:57 is unhelpful almost always it is used - only removing that (and the bits at 2:53) - the song would be _absolutely amazing_  - 0:10 is nice, but it still tiny bit kind of 'muffles out' Calli ? ... am I insane? Idk. I feel it... - 0:25 to 0:46 works well! - it's more 'behind' her than 'over' her, so it's nice, and has a clear reason for being there // that whole 'dubstep' segment is good - 0:47 - that is clearly on purpose. I might not be a fan of the 'high left' part, but that's on me - nothing wrong with the song - I understand what they are going for and it works - 0:52 - the 'dong' over 'mou'ntain : great; but after that, it's as described above... - 1:42 is great ; 1:53 still works well - it is matching Calli, instead of going against her - 2:22 is great, but then following with the 'melody' is too much (2:24 etc.) - 2:53 - just why? ... no... - same with 2:59 -- Those are not things to go over the singing... - 3:04 - YEAH! - That's the place to put it. Not before.  - It's like the feeling of JRPGs - There's just too much going on... and it's not properly 'cooperating'... - There are sometimes so many ... "rhythms" you don't properly feel the beat... - You have to fight to sync up with Calli, instead of the music leading you to it... - It really sometimes feels like 2 people made it independently to the same RPM ... and then synced some parts a little... - which makes sense, but still...  .... I don't mean nothing bad. I love Calli... I'm just sad.     and I know nothing about music; I'm just writing what I felt.
Oh god, my house burst into flames when this came up
ヤバすぎて歌詞が頭に入ってこんかったけどとりあえずRIPの衝撃を超えてくるのヤバすぎる ヤバい、語彙力もヤバい
Idk why lots of people r misunderstanding calli's song, it never attacked any indie. It's about "stand up, do something whatever it takes if you have passion in what you're doing not just complaining or comparing" in a savage way  And talking about vtweeters, there r also some good vtweeters but the haters r the vtweeters that complains and also spreads hate like saying "calli is just at the top bcz of company". Well, she auditioned for it and totally showed that it is not only the company. And no matter if Calli is just with a company or not, dont make it as an excuse of your downfall. As what in the lyrics says "so watcha gonna do about it, sucker?" youve totally got nothing to do with her but got something to do to urself by making content. Yeah others dont make content but theyre not jealous and spreading hate more like bcz it's not their passion.   Also the lyrics says "an ocean full of competition" think about how many vtubers r increasing and even outside vtuber world it happens, so instead of comparing urself to others and complain why they got fame this and that, go stand up and use that energy from complaining to improvement.  And i think her term "stop tweeting" can be viewed as "stop complaining" since it twitter r commonly used for ranting  Hope this would help those people who misunderstoods  Lol i just did another comment for this.
The metallic snare is fricking insane.
Goddamn our boy didn’t just reap those fools’ souls she straight incinerated them to ashes
Mori comes to graveyard. Excuse me, is this the RAVEYARD?
"When it all comes down to the wire, just who survives? Are they the liars who sell their souls, or those who dedicate their lives?"  So many damn callouts to the easy street-taking community these days. Damn.
I just have this feeling this could have a Choreography Dance...  can't wait
Alright I’m motivated time to create
カリオペとトップハムハット狂は最強過ぎんか…！？！？
美しすぎる…
This song gave me a burning passion and burning house
Awesome, we need more of your music!
E
THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE BANGER!!! NICE
Lyrics are so damn meaningful I love it
Epic
0:20 Oh, so that's why she's best girl
かっこ良すぎる！！
Yeah I'll probably be laughing the whole day.
I had to watch it twice in a row to get the lyrics because the voice in my head screaming "plz step on me mommy" and the sight of Mori in a kimomo was too much for my soul. Now that i have a grasp on it very good song Calli. I guess in any order of things it's easier to put the blame on someone else rather than do something to improve your life. Heck i had a time where i blamed the world for every missfortune i had. Now thanks to therapy i realized 2 things. 1- I am more valuable and i have more resources than i give myself credit for most of the time. 2- the world ain't gonna adapt to you. We all have our fights nobody has it easy and you probably deal with stuff that would crush other people while other people can deal with stuff that would crush you much better. So yeah life might give you a bad hand. You can cry and despair just don't stay there.
🔥🔥🔥
Hell yes, new Calli song! I wasn't even aware of vtweeters until a day or so ago, but yeah, they really should put the effort in if they want the following.
This is giving me a final boss in a tower dungeon vibes
Holy hell Calli. i know your a Reaper, but you didn't have to kill it that hard. Amazing stuff.
2018: Eminem Dissing MGK 2021: Mori Calliope Dissing Vtweeters
1:41 😂😂😂 you know who y’all are 🔥🔥🔥👋🏼🍑👋🏼🍑
Whyyyyyyy you so beautiful !!!!!
when ollie comments first before kiara on calli new music video:
おぉっと、めっちゃ綺麗😍魂とられたねこりゃ Oops,it's beautifur😍You took my soul. 英文あってるといいな。
214 useless ass Debut TBA's took this personally enough to hit that dislike 😂 damn Mori save some kills for the rest of us
amen
Me 🙇🏻 to Calli
Yooooooo the ending tho when she said heads I never thought calli can sound like that!!!!!
Alright fine Calli I’ll release a song this week... Jesus, just get off my back.
かっこよすぎる
this sound and art just scream could you R.I.P.* for me. and how doesn's love it. it is just so great.
this song is the most synth bass genre hybrid ever
this is a banger, damn
Another bop for the year
かっこいいし可愛い！！
Oooooooh, ya boi out here vibing and dissing. Hell yeah!
Damn unexpected diss track fire as always
aaaaand saved to the motivation playlist. thanks Calli :)
I hope this is a preview to a future outfit. It looks very nice!
Wait, what’s the drama? I just thought she made a song for the sake of making one
This song is a great call out for those literal deadbeats out there. I hope this message will hit the ears of those who are able to listen and plant a seed of productivity in them.  Make your Dad proud of you, Dead Beats!
I wonder if she actually have sung full song in Japanese too.
Fun fact, being beheaded does not bring instant death, as the brain stays aware for at least three seconds after the beheading, and may stay alive for longer
I only have one head left after hearing this song
Calli... our knees ... onegai....
who's gonna map this on osu no cap
Hey, This was pretty good :)
Im here for bang my head
It's insane how unbelieveable good this is, the flow the Voice the beat and the mixing is just working together dancing, chilling. It's really really nice. I didn't hear a single "flaw" or hickup. ur flow is consistent and i'd dare to say perfect. good fckin job calli.
bruh, that samisen though !
virgin “vtuber” vs the chad vtuber
OH GIRL, OH REAPER, OH GIRL, OH REAPER!!! I'm deadbeated.
You know.... im not usually much of a fan of rap but this track was fun to listen to and had a great message  :) 10/10 miss mori
fire
神曲しか作れねーんだな
You're music is always really good I can't wait to hear more from you
She's talking from her work experience, but seriously, this applies to anything and everything that requires one's commitment to perform. "are you ready to swing your scythe until the fun stops", can be used for anything that, because success requires hard work. The song is amazing without the context, the dissing and burning is the best kind of cherry on top. Love you Queen!!
Imagine mid singing this song calli gets a call to pay her rent (if she live sin a rented apartment)
This is lit
Idk why but the beats doesnt match the way it must sound
Im a litte bit disappointed in this song, her others were way better.
This flow is crazy
Welp another jean's song breakdown then
If this isn't proof enough of why you should be a Dead Beat, damn fam.
Just going to add that to the music playlist 👀
I love this song... and calli
Can't kill us with that beat cause we were already dead.
You call my stance average? How dare you say exactly the same as my HEMA teacher! It hurts ;-;
EEEEEEEEEEPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY
和×洋＝神
Like Luka got renewed
I think after so many hours of destiny, everytime she says the word "mountaintop" I get a little ptsd
Calli is just eminem in disguise at this point
mix AOさんってマ？
THIS IS OUR BOIII! I love this song!
my favorite yet. god damn.
What were the reactions of vtweeters? I'd like to know cause I don't like scrolling through twitter. Too many negative shiz.
Booba       I'm sorry
⊙ω⊙不知道說什麼，好泥害。
Damn she’s fragging
I FELL ASLEEP, I CAN'T BELIEVE I WAS 3 MINUTES AWAY FROM LISTENING TO THE PREMIERE AND I JUST WENT TO SLEEP Still this track is straight up fire, Calli just murdered everyone 🔥🔥🔥
this hit harder than Truck-kun
I disappointed for thumbnail i think beat is japanese or other(about string instrumental) type but its like hip hop dubstep and rap like old school But its okay its so sick one!
meh
RIP AND TEAR
Another masterpiece
Welcome to the mountaintop
ele gosta
dope asf
This is hands down my favourite track from Calli so far, and judging by how things are going so adamantly, she'll only get better with timee 😩
My favorite fake girl
Every Song from You is a Masterpiece... And they just get better each time I listen to them... I have found my new Favorite Song I feel... Amazing Work, Calli... This Song has made my Day much better... ❤️👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Omg, what a song, wow~ Hard to believe how much stuff is in it and it's all relatable... You always outdo yourself~! Great song, great job~! I love it allot~ The bars you drop are always too hot, the burn on haters is real, I bet it makes all Deadbeats squeal as they lose their heads~ It's true, people should write on Twitter less because the true path to success is getting rid of the excess things that people do~ I myself worry too much, I think the lack of action it brings puts me out of touch, but I am doing my best regardless and am learning how to become a better person, to move forward fearless~ Calli, you are such a great inspiration, the songs that you make gives me motivation regardless of my constant hesitation~  I will do my best, I always feel like life is constantly putting me on a test~ Often I wish to rest because everything feels like such a mess, however I want to find in this chaos of mine the golden line which makes everything fine, the suffering I go through makes this all feel more divine~ Maybe this all has a higher meaning and is more sublime, but regardless, I hope that I do fine~!  Thank you Calli for always working so hard, for being yourself~ Because you constantly are doing your best, giving love, this is what brought you success~ Love you allot~! Can't wait to see more of what you got~
3 hourse since premiered... hehe... fuck...
straight to the point I see 🤣
A greatful song like always  Love you calli
🔥🔥🔥
WHat  Da did i just walk into.
i love thisss Amazing as alyways! 💀
TBAs absolutely blown the fuck out
I just  wanted some pizza rolls please stop
Calliope Mori: _streams with max Politeness_ Ya Boi: *Off with their HeADs*
And she was worried about her throne
Thank  you…Thank  you…
Bestow upon me an ambition!
My English is bad, so every time I replay this song I learn another new roasts, burn. OVERALL IT'S LIT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It god to the point that i get shivers down my spine when hearing your songs. Theyre too good
So I fell asleep before the premiere but this is fireeeee
Probably one of her best songs, and that's including her old stuff.
THE ART STYLE THO
o
Here before the weirdo hero hei dude makes a content out of it
I can make this a super banger but I'm too lazy to upload so lucky you if you found our discord
This sure is different.... BUT I LOVE IT!!!
Hear hear
Wow, so cool.
waiting for the spotify drop
THIS IS SICK!!
This song is fire! 🔥🔥🔥
AOって見えてもう色々と最高！って思って聴いたらやっぱり最高！ AO節効いたリリックを見事に歌い上げるカリオペちゃん流石です！(*´∀｀)
Calm down, Please! This is too perfect for this world! ✨-✨!!!
looks like my neighborhood  is burned downed... BECAUSE THIS SONG IS FIREEEE
this is so different, but also so Calli at the same time. Ever since the first stream of yours I found, you always inspired me with your hard work. Your "tough love" is exactly what some of us need to keep going! Thank you for always inspiring me to work hard and to be better everyday, my life is changing for the better lately, and I don't think I would have done it without you! Amazing song, great work as always! おつかり！
Who is waiting for Scru Face to listen to this masterpiece?
Lol, tough love is such an American thing
Calli just went in Guns Blazing, Taking Shots at Everyone left and right. I am both hit and Amazed.
My queen ~
Take my soul, My Queen
When can I buy this on iTunes shut up and take my credit cards
YESYESYES. Hopefully these "Content Creators" actually get the message this time.  Hell yeah. The  Diss Track I've always wanted.
Rap used to be the only kind of music i didnt like that much. This just might make me get into it.
Listening to this in karaoke is gonna be a trip:D
Me! Me! Me! Me your slave yes!!!
Thx my queen, l have a sick but important exam but I am ready to be swinging until the end, waiting for loop this song after this Exam  Also this song is amazing!!!
The dislikes are definitely from the VTweeters🤷🏻‍♂️
"Ya want balanced following?" "Start creating stop tweeting"  Damn she just exposed every single Vtuber TBA Debut in Twitter
SO COOL
yaaaaaaaas queeeeeeen
absolutely based
Everyone here being like „oh she’s destroying the pre debut vtubers“ no. She’s not. She’s saying „I want to see you at the mountain top, so start creating“ and as a pre debut VTuber who is working really hard to put out artworks and streams as best as I can, while being disabled, I feel really happy hearing that. Pre debut isnt always just tweeting memes. For the ones not tweeting memes it’s getting a decent following so you’re not alone on your debut in which you put a lot of love and work.
"....Heads...."
Let's gooooo
Apply the salt into the burnt area
I LOST COUNT, BEEN PLAYING THIS ON LOOP SINCE PREMIERE
Too talented. Like what
Please tell me this will be the new outfit for Calli
和風+英語ラップとかいう頭が混乱する曲だからこその中毒性がヤバい…
Am i the only one enjoying the song to the point that i dont even care what the lyrics is even saying 🤣🤣🤣🤣
BEAUTIFULLL SLAY QUEEN
Yoooo, banger song AND art from ekao ?
Dope song, accidentally bang my head into my desk
trackまさかのAOさんじゃん！！
So many heads rolling.
I eagerly await scru’s reaction
yeeee another soong
For the people on mobile: 1. Add to playlist 2. Loop 3. ??? 4. *Profit*
Ahh Mori-Sama, blood will rain from the mountain top on your command.
So, Korone is collecting fingers, Calliope is collecting heads...Hololive starts to be really scary.
we stan a pink haired eminem
Yooooooooo that's fireeeee! Hype overload.
Calli. Take me now ♥️♥️
Yoooo
When a hear her spitting this much fire, I have a hard time believing she cried when she was working in the service business
who elce found the re-zero refrince
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
最高！！！！✨💓💞
Is this song gonna be on Spotify cus if it is time to put it on repeat
Still waiting for Cali to play Devil May Cry.
i see Calli is god!
Asokoni megaittesimau
You know it's good when you want to replay it as soon as it ends
Amazing! Even my friend that doesn't touch anime-styled things with a ten-foot stick likes your songs!
Hey that awesome, keep up the nice work !
Yo, you just rustled some EN Vtuber Debut TBA twitter user jimmies lmao. Keep it up and don't back down.
Oh damn, she murdered them!.. Anyway-
I was expecting a fire track, but damn was I surprised. Calli does not fail to deliver. Teach me your ways sensei, I am ready!
Vtweeters seething
This ain't no song. This a Diss track!
三味線のサウンドと英語って共存出来るんやなぁ
anyone else smelling burnt meat?
Hohoho Is this hard roast?
I got all the chills listening to this!! Thank you for this beautiful song, and I’m super excited for when you release a rock song c:
Eminem has been oddly silent after this
so good! i think i heard kiara at the beginning 😆
Everyone gangsta till you get called out
I’m getting mad Demon Slayer / Kimetsu no Yaiba vibes, Like a villian fighting a demon slayer throughout the mountain and through the night till morn.
BRUHHH SHE ONLY DELIVERS STRAIGHT FIRE AND NOTHING LESS
This is gonna be on repeat until the sunrise
Calli: *tells Vtweeters to actually work* Vtweeters: I'll pretend I didn't hear that
TBA ENVTUBERS DESTROYED
"Ya want a balanced following? Then start creating, stop tweeting"  Big oof from Calli dawgs, she's right!!!!
This is strait 🔥 thank you for all your hard work and I'm glad I get to be here to witness your brilliance! You're awesome Calli!
I accidentally listened to this the first time on 1.5x speed
THIS SONG IS LIT!! i love it calli, you have once again outdone yourself.
French fan love this song shinigami-sensei
This is soo gooood!!!  Love you Calli~!
People like this huh
I find I really like the songs when she starts throwing shade. Or at the very least they have a different type of hype to RIP.
2:46 Peaced out retired... Is this a reference to who I think it's referencing to cuz of how the lines before were about the entitled Pre debut VTubers but I also think it also encompasses the Anti's attacks and how they weren't effective but this line coming after.... Hollow fiver?
Ah yes bars as usual we like to see it.
Take my souls my queen
no one gonna talk about the subtitle ? turn on the subtitle u will understand
カリオペカッコいい。
When will this be on Spotify I NEED it
Morian Calliope
I personally LOVE this tough love sort of vibe! It gets me hyped and motivated to achieve my goals, and attack the day with aggression.   This is now going on my gym playlist. Thank you Calliope for this banger!🔥🔥 It's a good kick in the ass for me if I ever slip up.
Great as always!
サムネ物騒でワロ
yooo sick beat aside the message in this is fire
This song smashed my head off
POUUUUURR THE OILLLLLL!!!1!1! 🤣
I want to see that outfit as a live 2d model
another hit your aim is impeccable
好き…
Ebic
This would still be popping even if she only released an instrumental version i swear
Calli: releases this song* *Vtweeter population dropped to zero
This was worth staying up until 5am and going through classes with 2 hours of sleep.
We were just listening you on Discord and you give us new song, amazing.
Listening to the preview on Twitter: "oh my she's added a swing style to this song"  First line of the song: "Dead Beats, swingin now"  XD
ALL RISE FOR OUR BOI, DEAD BEATS!!!!
Asides from how generally amazing the song is in terms of its lyrics and rhymes, is it odd that I find myself being grateful that she managed to put "Rip and Tear" into the lyrics?
Damn the lyrics really fire my heart up...!!!
Now we need a song from Gura about hunting people down in the water and world would be a better place
So what was the peak viewership for this? I'm curious
are we gonna get a new costume? I really wish!
Rushia's gonna be busy resurrecting all the people who got slayed by this track
She dropped the mic harder than Amelia ground pounding our moms.
She never miss
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Bruh how is my phone not burning with the amount of flaming Calli is doing on them vtweeters
Goddamnit i missed this because of my class    Ight time to skip some classes from now on
Loving the FIRE in this. Probably out of Calli's songs, the one I'm looking the most forward to hearing an EDM version of. Just hitting up the tempo a notch and adding some deeper bass beats would turn this into a total dancefloor banger, and we have some extremely talented remixers in the community, you know they won't stop there.
2:05 Shade being thrown at V-tubers whose debut is still "TBA"
fire
Calliope Mori u should invest ur money in crypto. Always do ur own research.
💜
Thanks for your words of encouragement. This deadbeat is about to publish her first book despite haters saying I wouldn't. Never stop creating!
This REALLY is a vibe man
The murdering was... Dear goodness.  I need to sleep now. This was too much bloodshed.  Bless this.
another Great Original from Calli Thank You! <3
言の葉の見つからぬほど この歌謡はめでたしかし
This one just slams!
Actions speak louder than words. Yes, talking about you talkers
Dang, people are murdered. Death Queen indeed!  Hero Hei is gonna have a take on this. Calling it.
Calli doesn't need her schyte  She already have a better weapon for these stuff Specially this line : 2:04
(*￣ii￣)ﾊﾅｼﾞブゥｩｩ
No ambition, try again next week.  I'm die, thank you forever.
This song made me real happy that I just threw myself into the community and started streaming instead of dragging things on forever.
this is something
*"Start creating, stop tweeting"*  Damn Calli didn't have to do them haters dirty like that 😂😂😂
All hail, the Daughter of Death.
dope
been head bobbin and rollin to this on loop since the premiere. Hella (heh) nice work Miss Mori! I've loved all your work, but can definitely see your improvement in such a short time. This is my new favorite.
This song lives in my head and heart rent free
Oh snap, Vtweeter got rekt!
This song was absolutely amazing, I'm glad I can listen to this absolute masterpiece to start my day off right!
Eminem = dissing muble rappers Calli = dissing vtweeters
The ecstasy loop will begin to spin...    FOREVER
Now I'm just waiting for Scru to explain to me what the lyrics mean because I'm too dumb to understand the hidden meanings and metaphors in music. My mind is too occupied with "This is a nice beat, the melody is good, the rhythm is great, the words rhyme" but I can't understand what the actual words being said.
lit
Oh yes!!!
Boomer reaper made me die with laughter. Top kek
Yoooooooo this exactly the kinda pump up I need before an exam
I need more alts lol I need to like this more than a hundred times lmao
That outfit reminds me of one of IJN Kaga's outfits in Azur Lane, especially with the mask.  Oh, and Twitter?  IT'S GAME OVER.
wow i didn't expect a "collaboration" with tophamhat
this is your best song  i love it so just epic the sound effects you  put in so good they go with the song perfectly
Another amazing song from Death herself!
bars.
The callout that was truly needed by the hardest working VTuber in the biz!!!! Calli just spitten nothing but da TRUTH!!! HOLLA BACK WHEN YA PUT IN DA WORK!!! 💀✊😎  One million DEADBEATS got THE REAPER'S BACK!!! We always will..... 😎👍🌹💖💀
WOOOO YEAH BABY THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITIN FOR THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
Can't wait for this to be #1 on all music streaming platforms.
Dammmnnnnnn, this is sick!!! <3
Damn , she's reaping them all like they're wheat fields
what the actual f
Genre: dead beats
NGL this has to be my least liked song from calli so far.
*Geez,Calliope.*  *This girl has no chill.....*
FEEL FREE TO COLLECT MY HEAD THIS IS SO GOOOOOOD 🔥
Well if you want to take my head I guess that's ok, I'm not using it much, but I should warn you that's someone's in my head and she's not even paying her rent ! ... Wait. :3
damn, her sensei taught her well huh. well, thats death for ya.
Can someone call 911, my house is on fire when i played this song.
Eyy new calli song
Looks like I found my new "listen on loop for the next 25 hours" song
This song is throwing out massive shade  I have no idea who it's being thrown against, but damn it's a full on diss track
Im not a fan of this song, listening to it gives me a headache. Just being honnest, also its way too long lol
Its a fucking Banger
Shikimori Saikoro~🖤  Also this music would be perfect as a theme for Geisha in Identity V
So, can I say that Calli's like, half of Em turns Vtuber?
omg mori is official artist
Tbh I'm sorry but I don't blame the independent vtubers this much
Ayoooooo 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I really enjoy your exploration of different genres. As always, great work!  But now, nobody can tell me, that Calli is not a part of the eight million gods!
I woke up and this popped up. Starting the week with a banger.
Reminds me of demon slayer
I love this song so much! I can't help but feel like this as well as her other songs could be used for a video game soundtrack too
The Queen never lost her throne
The demons showing herself \0/
(´д｀)はぁ、、、、好き
GREAT TRACK💙💖🤗🤩✨🎶
is Mori-sama a goddess with Eminem genes in her? Damn this is cool!!!!
I am in awe.
Ready for another 1# bamger on Itunes?
Welp, this is the new song that I'm going to listen to everyday.
She just flexed on all wannabe tweeter Vtubers
So when are gonna get the Applebee's diss track?
Really cool effects, I love it.... buuut it might need some trigger warning for flashing lights. I don't know if it might trigger seizures or not, don't take my word for it, though.
“ Simply Follow my Leading” I’ll follow my Queen till the end☠️💜  Our Reaper Did it again!🖤 Thanks Recommendation
say it louder!
T+pazolite remix when
the theme and the songs really makes a great thing from calli's using previous songs and more to a upper level
Absolute fire. Also very... Motivational. At least, to me. Thanks, Calliope. "  Can't wait for the next one.
I can't even react properly. This is certified 🔥
I regret nothing
"She has a pink hair" "yes" "She looks like ze-" "Shut"
Reapers be like : *it's time to get funky*
ああ～～最高です、メロディも歌声も素敵だしPVも綺麗ですごく引きもまれました、これからも素敵な楽曲を楽しみに応援してます。　 あとチャンネル登録者100万人突破おめでとうございます。
I love this so much. I didn't think she'd make a song about calling out v-tweeters ("v-tubers" that just spend all day harassing -other- v-tubers while clearly having no intention of making any content of their own.)   I especially love the living rent free in their heads line, too make sure it's specifically aimed at them and can't be confused for actual indie v-tubers.
I need this song in my Spotify playlist now!!!
希望有中文翻譯……
WELL DONE CALLI! THIS IS SO GOOD
Now I cant stop swinging
This is amazing. I've listened to it on loop for about an hour now.
YES A TRADITIONAL-MODERN GENRE HYBRID  Collab with masa works designe when 🥺
This is why calli is my favorite vtuber
ALRIGHT, TALK TO US THEN! I SEE YOU, CALLI
The lyrics were amazing and callis voice was so passionate throughout the entire song
chad=calliope i love<3
I rarely comments on YouTube, i'm more a silent viewer usually, but man... your songs rocks!!!
When you miss the live stream ]:
When is this getting released of Spotify?
Those VTweeter just got murdered
Another great original song cool
Yooooo this is heat also nice beat
Ahhh.. super weeb music
Someone had to say it
Loved the song!
The beat be fire  Edit: The song is mixed by AO...Are the ancient ones working with death and his apprentice now?
We got those sick out of fashion vibes now boys
Great Song once again! Also we can`t ignore the awesome mixing by THHK/AO. Now we know why you were so hyped for this release =D
That sucker hits as hard as the nword from gtaV
BTW, hope at some moment there will be music video for this song, it could be rly cool tho
Another knock out of the park. Calli just doesn't miss. I'm gonna have this on repeat for the week to come I already know.
my headphones literally on fire!!!!!!!!
God damnnn, what a banger!! Goood work my guy. ugh (guh?) this song is sounds so ...  _noice_
goddamn this is amazing
PV気合い入りすぎててビビった。 カリちゃん改めて100万人おめでとう！！  ↓Google translation The song and PV are the best. Congratulations to 1 million people!
Goddammit, you should have put a warning to keep a fire extinguisher nearby.  You nearly burnt down my house
Thanks for reminding us that the journey to glory is paved with sweat, blood and tears. We may fall down, but the real measure is the way you stand back up. Thank you, Mori.
TBAs seething rn.
What a cool music!  I can feel the 和 atmosphere in this music! NICE!!!!!!!!
From jerking to swinging, Deadbeats will always prevail 💀
Bro I love how she burn all the twittards
I really cannot believe my eyes... Almost everyone here in the comments trying so hard to turn the meaning of the song into Twitter hate, incapable of accepting the criticism. And the rest are people saying: "This song has inspired me to get to the top! I know I'll get there sometime!" Bruh... "Stop talking" was for all of us, not for Twitter.
Miko senpai is an S confirmed
Nice.
This is legitimately one of the best tracks I've ever heard
THE LYRICS, THE FLOW, THE POWER SHE DON'T MISS
Scruface Jean's 6th sense is probably tingling lol
2:20 OMG I LOVE THIS PART!!! "Welcome to the mountain top, where we make the bodies drop." oof what a nice line!! This song sounds sooo different but still fits your style, good work. Another fine addition to my collection.
AOさんがきた。 もはやfaketypeが来てもおかしくねぇよな。 はよ。
FIRE
Antis in a coma after this
300k views in 3h. Jeez....
Oh my head, WHAT A HEAT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Dat beat, dat punchlines, dat voice **flexing**
MANNNN! CALI burn all
This song might piss off a certain group of people even though the message itself isn't a negative one. But speaking your mind is always going to upset the ones who need to hear it the most if they aren't ready to hear it. Keep swinging scythe proud and spitting that fire and the ones who count won't forget their Mori.
I'm so fat that the scythe cant cut my head off cause of the fats
This is my lullaby. ✊
its sooooooooo good
Even the captions are pretty
Cover employee HR : for EN gen 2 there are really a ton of applicants huh..guess we'll be doing overtime for a month to go over their resume and doing background checks.. Calli: lemme help you real quick
POGGERS
Youtube's gonna need to take out insurance for fire damage if Calli keeps bringing the heat like this.
Once again have you won me over, they do say that death is tempting, and this death in particular kills you lyrically!
song's neat
OG Dice diss track vibes. FEELSGOODMAN  And I mean OG, too. Meaning the albums that got removed. Especially "then start creating stop tweeting, this ain't me hating I'm just bored of all the talkers i'm just beating". And "I'll gladly live inside ya head but who the fuck pays my rent?"  And the chorus part "They spot the name, the fame ... easy for you to say little miss company hire ... as if these tracks (etc)" are lyrics still fighting against the haters from Dice to Mori. This girls ambition and drive is wild and awe inspiring  The only complaint I have is that the instrumentals are too overtuned, the vocals compete and become a bit difficult to hear
yo can we have the anime man do a duet with her, that'd be amazing
That tiny part at 2:14 sounds kinda like Undyne's theme, or am I just hallucinating?
Unbelievably Based
かっこいい！
これはかっこいい いや、これがかっこいい！
Oh, i get it.  This is *scaroused*
you ever tear up because somethings so good?
Such, FIRE
This is the closest thing to vtuber distrack that we will ever have
She. Just. Keeps. Raising. The. Bar.  Favorite thus far. Gonna have this on repeat for a while
My head feels better
The Queen.
That has to be Cali’s New Years outfit.
Anime girl releases a diss track
Wow
The art so beautiful, 🙏
Fire 🔥
Bloody amazing, keep up the great work!!
AOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
I have only one wish Can you take my head queen ?
Ballin
this song is banger the guns stopped firing
Damn, this song makes me want to finish my homework and be a Vtuber tonight.
nice.
Pogging calli droping massive beats!
"start creating, stop tweeting" those vtweeters ain't roasted anymore, they're charcoal's now
god i lost 😁
take my head omfg
You dropped this Queen 👑
"This b!tch has no talent! She was just hired by a big company!" "She got lucky that she got hired" "Easy life, they handled her a big name from start!" "She just sit there for X hours and make $XXXX !"  Heads are rolling, but it didn't have to be like that. She's not attacking, she just wanted to do her thing, but "past tense on reservations now I stand in defense", because once on the mountain top, it doesn't matter if you're looking for fights, just wait a little and they'll come.   If you're going to throw a rock, be prepared to receive one back, but most importantly, why did you feel the need to go out of your way to attack someone in the first place? Don't be pretentious, look at yourself. Especially if you want to be a critic of the industry, the system, society, whatever, if you do that while upholding hypocrisy, you're just doing worse for your onw cause. It's easy to point and judge, but more often than not, we're just pointing at our own demons. Internet and anonymity makes it easy for anyone to say anything and feel validated, but when talking about others, their lives, their experiences, we hardly know any sh!t about whoever we're talking about. We gotta learn to be humble, remind ourselves constantly to stay humble. Going a bit further on the tangent, this reminded me of the quote "every saint has a past and every sinner has a future" (Oscar WIlde, A Woman of no Importance)... It's easy to look at someone's success and forget about their path to reach it, their origin. And it's easy to, being a "sinner" on our own personal hells, fall prey to our "sins" and delve in discontent and envy, forgetting this doesn' t have to be our final stage and we still have a future. There's a way out, so pursue it. But yeah, I'm already digressing a lot, lol.   Why am I even writing this? No idea, actually, I'm mostly self reflecting about the lyrics of this amazing song. It's unfortunate and ironic that the people who most needed to get this reality check from Calli will probably just take it as "uh-oh, she's hating on me" or if they understand their pride will blind them of their own condition. But even for me that have respected and admired her work from the start this is a valuable message, and I thank her for creating this great song. It's meanings are valid for way more situations, it's a good life lesson. You're really inspiring, Calli!!!  Thanks, Dad, keep on going on this journey, we'll be here to support you on this path, as you're here to help us when we need it too!
Vergil: “Now I’m a little motivated.”
I feel personally attacked
POOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOG
ლ(́◉◞౪◟◉‵ლ) hype.
Does anyone else think Calli sounds like demondice?
Ok, as always, I never know what to expect from Calli, but she always knows how to surprise you. I really like this song but still, I'd say that Please RIP is my favourite.
this is friken awesome 😭😭😭THE LYRICS ARE SO DOPE LIKE WHO GAVE YOU THIS MUCH TALENT CALLI 😭😭😭
I love you now
God damn Calli, the songs are getting better and better, I can literally feel the improvement. Good Job :D
Calli is the Eminem of vtubers  idc idc
God, completely lived up to the hype. Tons of meaning in the lyrics, gonna enjoy listening to this on loop for the next while
The only critic i have is that the beat is a bit loud over the rapping.
The rhymes thooo 👌👌🔥🔥
Now this gave me the tingles!
I'm an amateur artist and not exactly a vtweeter all the comments talk about, but this song really makes me smile and shiver at the huge mountain i have to climb in order to become a really good artist up there in the world. there are times where I can't see ambition in my work or its hard to work at all when you're facing art block. my mindset personally puts a lot of mental blocks that bar me from drawing. calli is my strict hero in this song, wanting me to put 100% into what I'm trying to pursue and improve upon. my inner workaholic is smiling, wanting to improve as fast as I can to make fanart for calli LOL . Anyways that was my weird self centered interpretation, keep up the great work calli!!!
Esto es hermoso!
Sugoi......
Your best song yet! FUCKIN LOVE IT!!!
和風着てて可愛い❤️
Goddamn. This song is shooting some very hot motivational bullets on people and sounds great to boot. Pretty cool, Calli.
Oh look. Another banger. A headbanger.  Also so glad you’re calling out the throng of Twitter “I’m a VTuber that’s never going to put out content but I will police the community.”
WHAT A  EFIN BANGER
Now we need a calli song with a metal soundtrack
I need a second concert🥺
THIS TRACK GOES WILD WTF
Ngl dad that kinda hurt, but aight I see you I'll start working on my projects again
Damn she burn them to atom lol
Damn those lyrics, I'm burning like a drill that will pierce the heavens. Time to get our asses off
めちゃくちゃかっこいい……
cool!!
Our boi didn't make a song, this is a murder weapon
Yo this song is good just not my type lol
"That moment when she said 'off with their heads', I really felt that" - Marie Antoinette
This is sick, It feels so Lit, No stop my soul Please Dont Leave!  OH, Hello there Mori Calliope ! ! !
絶対RBB好きやん
This song: exists*  Me: Sigh* Harakiri it is
Can we all just agree,that Cali has Best Bars when it comes to roasting all these haters? Like she really be spittin supa hot fire I can feel the heat just hearing her rap.
nice.
ψ(｀∇´)ψ🔥🔥🔥🔥
wating for this to get mapped on osu <3
Well, off with their heads
this is bop, please step on me
"Ya want balanced following?" "Start creating stop tweeting"  Calli literally just got a killchain and drop a nuke on those "Vtuber-Debut-TBAs "
Roses are red, Violets are blue, Our heads are yours, May the kitsune be with you.
And where can I purchase this masterpiece?
All the VTweeters are fuming.
So Tokoyami Towa already took my heart and you Calli took my soul......❤❤❤❤❤
Thats.... FUCKING SICK HOLY CHEESE BURGER XD
well this is better than 99% of all music. did you hear that music industry the grim reaper personly did your exicution
Damn, just damn. That was dope!
This isn't a dis track, it's a *death sentence* !
I got a goku slapping someone's ass ad  anyone else?
0:38 Meow
Cant wait for it to be released in spotify
Nice i love this song✨✨😆😆
Yeah Im late... This is MASTERPIECE The time can't stop me listen my waifu-nope my friend song
So what I get from this song is that Calliope wants us to succeed by working hard, even if you don't see immediate results. This song is a good motivator, and a great song
I bet this is gonna hit 1M views within 24hrs
what just happen  my head is hurting
森さん本当に凄いポテンシャルあるよなぁ。 あと、曲作ってる人もセンス良いしなぁ。 マジで凄いわw
In my head I imagine Calliope is "Sadistic Sakura" and you are her favorite gladiator. She watched you go from wimp to badass and since you never could die, she likes throwing harder and harder things for you to fight.
めっちゃ踏むなー
I was half asleep until 3 and a half minutes ago. Now I'm ready to swing my blade.  Absolutely fire, Calli. I love it. <3 You've done it again.
I wanna call her "SADISTIC SAKURA"
* hands over my head * You dropped this, queen. 👑
やば、好き
5 seconds in and im already getting goosebumps
Love the song
This comment dosent exist and u won't see it
Thats some high quality artwork
Calli gets better and better I swear
I absolutely love this. Listened to this a few times and I gotta say your music has gotten my creative juices flowing. Not sure how these ideas in my brain will manifest just yet though. After all it's one thing to have ideas, it's another to actually be able to do something about them. Only time will tell at this point.
queen
素晴らしいラップだ。 此方もイヤホンを着けなければ失礼である
カリオペちゃんの歌は力強く響く感じがかっこいい👍
You can really tell the amount of work put into this song, Calli’s way with words is something else. Absolutely love it.
もりやん着物お美しいでごわす
I CAN'T STOP LISTENING TO THISS YOU'RE AWESOMEEE😍😍😍
totally haven’t watched this 37 times wym
An Absolute Queen.  After hearing the song 3-4 times, I kinda get the message before that my monke brain just happy with the bip and bops
This song is straight fire!
That’s right Calli. Call out those VTumours / Vtweeters.
Banger
Instructions unclear. This song was so hot that it burned me🥵🥵
Callope looking as beautiful as ever. Dead beats on standby for orders 👍 Oh and ollie is ready as well it seems 😂
I'm gonna request this song to play at my funeral☠️💀
Calli just straight up pull a genocide against all those TBA vtubers on Twitter with this masterpiece.
yes
Time to get funky
何もかもがかっこいい
Calli is rapping again ?     Always has been .
This is so good 😻💕
I get Afro Samurai vibes from this song! Hope someone will make an MV with dem aesthethics one day. Would be damn cool
Me: *goes on YouTube and see this* Also me: YEeeeeeeeeeS
look, no one is born a star. if you want to succeed in this business, you have to be creative and put in some work. i think thats what calliope is trying to tell you.
My head is yours, my queen.
that ara ara pose
I'm waiting for this to appear on spotify to add it to my playlist
Dammmmmmmmmm boii, i love this song <3
You already have my heart, now you're taking my head!!!
Based
300 thousand views in 4 hours and it doesn't get trending, fuck you youtube i want this on trending
Epic!!!!
This song makes me want to shotgun a Bang energy and do some pushups
Other people be saying this is a shots fired moment directed at ENVtubers/vtweeters, meanwhile I'm over here thinking that it's quite a motivational song directed at them (and anyone really) so they can push forward and work even harder, literally stop tweeting for a sec and churn out content! Fire song 🔥🔥🔥
404 Chill not found.
This song gave me some *SERIOUS* Mind Brand vibes and idk why But *DAMN IS THIS GOOD*
好棒喔 12點了
Scru better get on this 🔥ASAP
Here before Kairyu
Imagine when fans making different genre for this song like R&B, City Pop, Acoustic, or lofi
WOAH, SOUL STAY HERE!
A perfect song my queen 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼😎
Calli being supportive of her fanbase, nice
何言ってるかわ感ないけどかっこいい
Just casually head banging until the last thing I remember I can only see the floor
Who Are We? The "Before the 1 Million gang"!
holy fuck
Almost made me remind of Rusty Cage and Enimen at once
Is this aim to those vtuber wannabe that instead making content theyre busy with drama and also attacking calli because she happened to be succesfull, tough love indeed
I saw line "RIP and tears"
This is fucking spettacular
斬首助かる
Jigoku Shoujo!!!!
AO！calliope！waaaaa!
I'll turn  into a simple if this goes on
when on spotify
Ooh! The flow in this one is SICK!
Yes
I wanted to like this more but the track kinda drowns her out.  Her rapping is on point and matches the flow well but something is off.
WE ALL SHALL RISE UP, DEADBEATS
Hat's off to you ma'am
真的是太有才了!!!
This song's deadly
Damnn that tweeting line was hard
BRUH CALL THE FIRETRUCKS WESTERN TWITTER IS ON FIRE BRUUUUHHHHH
Never seen kills this clean before
RAISE THE DEADBEAT FLAG
If we ignore all the hate comments regarding "vtweeter" this is a really motivational song. BRB changing my burnt pants after listening to this song.
The beat is absolutely devastating, perfect for these lyrics!  Awesome as always, Calliope-sensei!
When is this coming to spotify!!!!!
Amazing song!!    Was this electro swing?
俺は強いぞ！この歌は素晴らしいだ (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و♡
Helll yeahhhh. Uhhhh reapper trapperr
yes yes take my goddamn head
和っぽいけど英語だけてラップしてるのかっけぇ
Is it going to go up on spotify also?
Wow
2:52  "Dedicate their lives"  .....     SHINZOO SASAGEYOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Damn this gives me chills
和風×ラップの発想好き
Pogges
So what? I guess we are getting this song to 1mil in the first 24 hours? 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This goes so hard and we all know it comes from someone who can absolutely back up the Tough Love "smack talk". Calli earned her fans through working herself into the ground giving us content and she has all my love and respect. I'm glad my fellow Dead Beats have supported her enough that she's in a much better place to do what she likes and I am STOKED every time she has a new work announcement. Shows how much we love Our Boy!
As a creator, this is so inspiring. Thank you for your hard work Calli! I hope I can collab with you one day 💖
This song burns
1 word can explain everything 🔥🔥
Sick art tho
YOOOOOOOOOO
absolutely perfect
I was wondering when she’d do another song. Amazing as ever.
和風trackと英語ラップの組み合わせがここまでかっこいいとは思わなかった… 歌詞も和訳も書いてあるし最高にイカしてる！
Debutubers on life support.
they don’t call Calli “the reaper” for nothing <3
So wait, when she said that she wanted to become a shrine maiden before, it was foreshadowing this?
I already know that this song will get popular on tiktok
Youtube is high right now because this SHOULD BE ON TRENDING
Its funny because you can tell this rap was partially written out of love and calis desire to see indi vtubers get into the scene Tough love is still love!
😌 bro ima be jamming to this for 3 hrs or so. Love it ❤️👀
IS THAT A KAZOO SAMPLE AT 2:52
This is my favorite song from you so far!
Damn good variety of rapping
Heads are falling and rolling... 💀🍷
You released the song exactly for my B-day, I love it
Reminds me to the world of Tokyo + Shinagami vibes coming from here!   YOU DID AMAZING JOB CALLI-CHAN! 🔥☠🔥☠🔥☠🔥☠🔥☠🔥☠🔥☠
And off to the VTuber rabbit hole I dive while this is on the background.
WOAHHHH FIREEEEE THIS IS SOO GOODDD AMAZINGGGG ILY CALLIII!!!
I feel like the lyrics are part of the instrumental and my head thinks that there aren't any meaning to them. It literally just became music to my ears.
dang, she's a reaper for a reason. the lyric in her song can kills a lot of life. lmao  and i love it
well. that's a nice new one.  I think there are no other artist that I can say I like 100% of their work. Keep it going, love what you do.
I am here to read comments
swift and brutale like death itself. amazing.
Love how she takes this way to address the twitter retards, because all of us know if she hit the issue head on, its probably gonna get her fired LOL
She already foreshadowed this with the shrine girl thing😩🔥🔥🔥
Welp it's Time to put this masterpiece in loop
BANGER
Absolutely killed it Mori! Right onto my music playlist. Keep up the good work.
This is Lit!!!!
The eminem of hololive en. Time to roast... I need more of this music!
More than a certified banger, this is a goddamn public execution. (Also that "Rip and Tear" line *shefs kiss* perfect)
... *heads*
Calli pls the Earth is already getting hotter and hotter cuz of global warming and now you drop *this*? this sick burn? hell fire are too hot for this Earth, girl
bruh the beat
Peace was never an option
the lyric is way too spivy lmao vtweeter roasted
Eminem vs MGK? Naaah, It's *Vtubers vs Vtweeters* Now! This track is 🔥 af
Ppl callin and hating her so much that she make a legit song to counter it. Not with tweet or general statement
You know what? I'm gonna take you up on this. I will work harder on my artwork, even though I am not a youtuber, I think I could stand to work harder on my Instagram page.
sounds like a song made by jt music
Good day Ms Reaper, pls do take my head aswell  Have a lovely day !
THHK beats are god tier bruh
(Unspeakable voice)
SO COOOOOOOOOOOOL
I feel the demon vibe!
Calli's Wano outfit looking great
And here I tought Calli was on reaping hiatus
今回も最高すぎる！！！しかもmixがトップハムハット狂！！？さすがカリオペ………
Damn, this track is slick! <3
And on February 1st 2021 the world discovered it didn't have nearly enough firefighters to deal with Calliope Mori.
Another banger, sasuga Calli!
Can I have my head until I listen to end?
Mountaintop
waaaaw
So well written. Like hard as nails , blunt, but inspiring at the same time.  Well done Shinigami!  I have to say this. I singlehanded started building a game from scratch. Never did it before. This game has been my life for almost six months now, and I will see it to the end. Years if need be. The end justifies the work, pain, and criticism I have had so many people tell me the scope is too big. And I walk the other way. I won't take shortcuts, I won't make it easy mode. This game is art, and it will reflect that.  I won't compromise on my work quality. Even if I have to spend 18 hours a day to make sure it comes out great.   If you want something, don't let others tell  you to quit. Don't talk about it. DO IT.
The dislikes came from the burnt Vtweeters lmao xD
holy f**k great job calli, like this song is amazing damn
we neeeeeed this on spotify
I expected bars..... and that's what i got 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
livin rent free
Thats hot.
This is my new favorite bop
fire
I ain't gonna report this to the police for murder, cause this reaper need a whole-ass Geneva Convention for this Twitter-hood genocide.
Ok, I Experten aus little big more Anger but im positively surprised. I love your music although I don't really Listen to this Kind of Music but its still fun to Listen to. But you could really try Metal 😅👍
0:38 dw u can live in my head rent free queen
Im getting a lot of Akagi vibes from Calli in this musikvideo, and im cool with it ;)
Unholy mountaineering at it's best. Revelling in the enlightenment only violence can provide.
That's actually good.
There's a lot of strong moments in this song that absolutely slaughter, but I gotta say there's weak moments in the song that really pull it down.   AKA, I'm putting it on loop for the next couple days.
ok this slaps.
here's my head queen
Good song 👍🏻♥️
This is what it would sound like if slim shady was a cute anime girl xD
5 seconds in...crying for how good it sounds
Mori back with that 🔥🔥🔥
based
Im waiting for roar reviewing :D
what if... suisei x calli collab song? Felt so hot that my house is gonna burn
I love this!
Well, time to wait for people to use this as either an intro nor an outro for a video
Why does it feel like ito junji drew the cover art?😂

"Those with devotion to the mission Straight devour the weak An ocean full of competition Get your action to speak You can't be strong if you give up From just a miss in ya streak"  This part somehow really motivate me the most!! 🔥🔥🔥
Dissing the mainstream. Nice.
Live fire demonstration of the M4 Sherman Calliope -1944 colorised.
Vtuber DIFF!
What a way to start the day!! Whoo!!
Noice reaper
This is honestly some inspirational stuff. This song says a whole lot about being a creator, dealing with failure, haters, and how some people on social media grow to have a twisted perspective to get easy gratification.
The producer is really amazing
You can really tell how much was put into this, all the metaphors and actual facts combined to tell it like it is. I love the brutal honesty in this one. Just from the few songs released so far, i can tell each one has its own meaning even if it isn't very obvious. I had to listen to this one a few times, this is honestly a poem in the form of rap. Amazing
Reap my soul senpai~
Yup I can clearly see why Eminem is her favorite rapper.
This is one of the best rap songs I’ve ever heard
Calliope: "I'm not'cha "sensei," but I been saying sense" Her former Scythe-Swinging students: ???
oaky wow this is fantastic okay im going to listen to this a lot
THHK!?
take my soul
“Easy for you to say little miss company hire”  The amount of backbreaking work this goddess goes through in one week whether before or after this debut is more than what anyone saying that has gone through in their entire lifetime   I know exactly why this song is called “off with their heads”. This swing of the scythe fucking decapitated people
Damn mori, how hard can you go?
is... is eminem okay? so quiet i'm worried. kusa! jk
i love how all mori's songs begin with "dead beats"! this song was amazing :D
oh god I need to listen this for AT LEAST 10 hours straight
BASED. DOPE. SUPER LIT.  It's about damn time those VTweeters get called out Awesome song as always, Calli
Epic rap battle when? HoloEN Calli vs HoloJP Korone
BASED. DOPE. SUPER LIT!
Hommie woke up and picked genocide. Total banger.
Just curious, does Mori watch one piece? Getting a lot of wano vibes from this. all in all love it
SHE DON'T MISS
Well done, You've earned your place and your fame, Truely
Acabo de imaginarme la siguiente canción del LOL cantada por calli
I think it's ok, for me it's a bit too complex compared to your other work and just a bit harder to follow. Don't get me wrong our boy is my fav and I really "really" love her "older" stuff a LOT. I just kinda feel like this one is just so different ya know? I'll probably give it a bunch more listens when it is on spotify and it will likely grow on me as I get to know it.  feel free to lop off my noggin anytime, for whatever reapers do with heads ig.
かっこいいいいいいい😭💕👏 リリックがとても良い……着物姿も最高！
me feeling the wieght of life and need some spiritual boost calli : hold my scythe and gimme a mic here we go thank you calli i need that ps : you make a beautiful kitsune...... food for thought 😊
Awesome scenery
I am now Extremely motivated, thank you Miss Reaper.
Calli literally putting a scythe to all "Vtweeters" throat and saying "do your thing or you're coming with me"
This hit differently, my replay button is broke.
Traducción de la descripción / Description translation (ES) "¡Bienvenido a la cima de la montaña!  Vuestro chico (Calli) quiere ver que todos los Deadbeats tengan exito.  Por favor, no odien a vuestro chico por darles a todos ustedes un poco de amor duro...  Muchos de ustedes Deadbeats ya están en su propio camino a la grandeza, y haciendo la maldita cosa que quieres hacer.  Quizá algunas cosas están fuera de tu control...En tal caso, quizá el mensaje de esta canción no está dirigido a ti. Pero para aquellos que necesitan un poco mas de motivación, TE TENGO CUBIERTO  Amor como siempre, de la primera aprendiz de la muerte. Yo, ¡Calliope Mori!"  Eso es todo :D Disfruten de la canción! No puedo traducir la letra, ya que se me hace algo difícil, pero puedo explicar mas o menos a que se refieren, si es que este comentario adquiere algo de tracción.  PD: Te amo Calli Edit: Lo de "Vuestro chico" es una traducción directa de "Your boy", que no se como mas traducirlo
おやすみ means goodnight
Take up the sword and swing it until it's unbearable!  That's the only way you'll make it!  Strike! Strike! And strike again!  YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAH
I only know one VTweeter who successfully transitioned into a VTuber, Artemis of the Blue. Boy, just make good content consistently and the follows will come.
FIRE
wooooooooooooooo yeah babby
Thank you Calli. Not only is this an absolute banger, but it gets me fired up to do all the things I want to do. I have to work to bring my ideas to life.
I needed the motivation thank you!! *w* I regret going with a painterly style for my model illustration but TOO LATE NOW TwT ahahaha
Now that's a lot of damage.
yes
Mori: Start Creating, Stop Tweeting "V" Tweeters: Because someone with no career said it? Wow!! Mori: *Sing this music* "V" Tweeters: (They try to tell you that you're fine but you're not really fine)  This music is wholesome!!!
👏 :)
What a madlass, blessing out ears like this! Enjoy the homiemoon, Calli, you've earned it for sure.
Calli went off🔥🔥🔥
As a VTuber who's literally debuting tomorrow, this song FILLS ME WITH DETERMINATION. This song is fire!
"Then start creating, stop tweeting" Vtweeters: (Chuckles) I'm in danger
HOLY HELL. These words really got my adrenaline going. Time to pick up the sword and start swinging until it becomes unbearable. By that, I mean I'm working out hard to this. This was amazing, Calli.
Yooo how do you do those colored captions? Its so cool
Wows that so gnarly, damn kind of wished I had a decent talent. This coming from a dude who used to talk to spirits.
take my head ，my dear queen
Another amazing song Calli, you never disappoint
This sounds like an awesome song to fight to...  Or to watch a compilation of death reaping souls...Just sayin
God damn this honestly smacks
Aaaaaaand it's fire again, you just keep hitting those home runs Calli.
Yooo, this theme just fits like a puzzle piece in my situation xD I'll stay motivated and succeed! If the Grim Reaper's apprentice says it, I can't go against my boy 🤚😩👌
Will this be on Spotify?
You know its really interesting to watch what kind of songs she puts out, its like a bday gift every time.
is it me or does this song give early fnaf  song vibes
breathtaking
You are the one of those who inspire me. I want to get to that mountain top, and I'm going to do that eventually. It will be hard and I know it. I wanted to give up so many times already, and there's so much more to come. And I didn't even start producing content yet... I'm working on myself, so later all of you will know me by some other name.  This also might be just me talking into the void, and nothing of what I said will actually happen. I mean, what are the chances? But I won't give up. Thank you, Calliope Mori-sensei, for your awesome content.  Yours truly, aspiring Dead Beat.
Zero Two but a VTuber
Mori's really putting the rave in graveyard with this one.
Yet again a banger Track! God DAMN
First impression was "I mean it's aight", but I kept listening and bro... This is a head banger man. Gotta say Imma fan of this song too.
Just Do It with attitude...
What an amazing Song ma Boy. 👍🏻
This actually is your best song yet
Probably my favorite instrumental she's rapped to so far.
"start creating stop twitting" OOOOOHHHHH!!!!! that's cold Reaper, ice cold.
You can do anything to me
Can't believe I was 3 hours late
welp i just found a new workout song.
This really is a song that gets you pumped to get work done. I can't believe I'll be listening to a diss track written by an anime rapper to work out now.
失礼しますがRIPも難しくて歌えないのにまたこんな神曲出して…     まぁ鬼リピするんですけどね（）
Nobody: Calli: Vtweeters go brrrrrrrr
:)
Calli X eminem when
No puedo dejar de escuchar esta canción, la amo  I love it!
So is a Vtweeter just a twitter goon that claims to be a vtuber but doesn't actually upload content to YT?
Officer, I would like to report a murder.
So instead of doing things for School I am listening to this
This isnt shots fired, this is mass genocide, no. Worldwide genocide.
Dope
I can't believe Calliope commited mass murder....oh wait.  Memes aside, 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Calli's art is just damn
This song makes me think of the days before the reaper
It must be the ganja
Now this, this is pure talent
A great Motivational song. Thank you Cali
Straight f-wording fire, like always.
Acaso hay alguna canción de Callie q no sea jodidamete buena? Joder q talento! 👏👏👏👏👏👏
I don’t get the whole vtuber thing but this is sick 👍🏻
Really love this song. It has give back motivation to go back and try again to do the things I have once turned my back to...  I am really thankful that you make this song and for being a dead beat.
2:03 wtf i kneel
As a VTuber, this is relatable in a very personal manner. Thank you Calli 👌
aww yes !!!!!!! epic mori songs
Yes this one hits so good
Im dead,  tenk u poreba
\( ^ ๐ ^ )/❤  FC Mori calliope
WAH
LET'S GO REAPER QUEEN!
Calli: Im a reaper on hiatus Also calli:
This is actually the first video I’ve ever watched that had blood red subtitles that follow the song.      *LOVE IT*
I was not interested in vtubers but i'll support anyone who stand against the professional complainers of twitter.  Excellent work too, I of course can appreciate some good music.
I will continue to support you until my soul disappears
Head giveaway

Beautiful
Dam it i hate that I like this person but I HATE her songs
Yess
Kubi o dase
tung tak tung jrot
I understood.This is EN culture
WOW I LOVE THIS ITS SUCH A BOP
和風ラップは日本人の血が騒ぐ。
Never ceased to amazed me
Calli, why you so fucking good?! Song is almost as hot as the flames of hell!
和のテイストがいい感じでカッコいい
Well... Why roast them when you can burn them with hellfire, right?
Yess calli
Is anyone even surprised that it completely slaps?
森カリオペが歌う物はミリオン再生が約束されてるのやばすぎる
Use the burn heal! Use the burn heal!!! But not for me!!!!
Everybody gangster till you hear her calling dead beats
YAY!!!
かっこいいしか言えない
Damn, Calli you're so talented
I dont know Calli at all but Im so fuckin proud of her, its weird to me.
mori, have mercy i don't have a roof anymore...and your burning my house down... cuz this is freaking lit and fire
英語で和風な曲とは新鮮ですね
Bury the light give me power and motivation but Calli makes demons around me burn without leaving any ash.
I am die now
Best yet
I pray we get a instrumental of this
Now THATS how one deliver motivation in an awesome way. I'm inspired.   Also take my head pl--
Can't wait til I can get home and play this on the speakers so I can really hear the bass. These earbuds aren't cutting it...  EDIT: I WAS RIGHT the bass is sick
Absolute fire
Thank you
Calli outdoes herself again, Absolute banger🔥🔥🔥
Calliope: Take my head.  Korone: Take my yubi.  Coco: Take my supachatto money.  Haachama: Take my heart.
So god damn catchy I have this playing on repeat for like half an hour
Woow😶
I just listen to calli roast people because it reminds me of school. School ain’t the same without bullies
Thanks for saving rap game from those bullshit rappers, This IS SO FUCKING DOPE!!!!! When its coming to Spotify? :)
If I bow now and pledge my allegiance, can I wield a scythe in your honor?
this song just threw out procrastination out of my window I like it
nashe
JUST KILL ME ALREADY
I love you so much, thank you for this new song. It's really a great song
now this feels like good ol DD
To the Vtweeters who refuse who will continue to sit on their asses doing nothing... SHOTS FIRED. To the Vtweeters who see something else in this song... this is going to light the BIGGEST fire under their asses, and they are going to do something GREAT in this community as a result, and I can’t wait for that day to come!!! 🥰  I’ll be honest, this is also a great motivational song for myself, and I’ll definitely be taking this message to really do something. Thank you Calli. You’re the best 🥰
i am die thank u forever
It sounds like a FNAF song
~♥~~♥~~♥~~♥~~♥~~♥~
イラストめっちゃいいな
Now let’s protect this song from Tiktok.
Calli really twisted my music taste ngl this so great
"rap queen"
Not bad but you can do better...⬆️⬆️⬆️
Love the track, Calli delivers a thought provoking, deep and double worded banger as per usual
Man she really slayed that with her sythe of words
In some rhyme patterns you can see the influence of Em.. glad to hear good rap again
Calli,I’m Japanese listener.This song is very good proportions.I will continue to support you.
ああああああああありがとうございます！！！！！喜んでしゃれこうべ差し出します！！！！！！！
now this...THIS is music
1:31 "you can't be strong if you give up" our queen has spoken,  whatever you are facing, don't give up bois!!! stay strong
Not generally my type of music, but I love the lyrics and that's why I'm still listening to this song. I have a strong appreciation for the central message behind it too.
Calli: Deadbeats, my body is still weak because the wine hasn't kicked in yet. Will you offer me your blood?   Me: Yes, wih pleasure. Please accept this. *offers head*
Nothing gets me more pumped than listening to new Mori Calliope tunes 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
now this is my kind of motivational speech
I see 142 Vtweeters Treegered by this fire song. :^) WHAT A BOUNTIFUL HARVEST FOR THE GRIM REAPER HERSELF;;;  that said, beats, lyrics/message, cover art, everything was absolutely: Real/100  Keep being awesome Calli!
Poggers
Damn this is good
I never thought I’d get into rap but you did it, this song is excellent!
I’ve been listening to this for more than 2 hours in a row
A prime example of a flame’s purifying qualities
Wait - that's how she flows, That Ka-
🔥🔥
I commented earlier, but I’m commenting now that i’ve heard it...HOLY FU- That was so damn good, damnit mori, this song actually makes me want to try harder....Ahhhh, i’m going to do it mori, i’ll reach high enough to get to talk to you myself one day. I will hit the top, just wait, I haven’t shown myself yet! MC POWER! Lol
So hot that it's cold to the point of freezing
Meh.
Another fire one, well done Calli, I always enjoy your work, can't wait for next masterpiece!
I really think that everyone can appreciate Calli's tough love message, especially  It's not enough to simply say "I want this really badly, so I deserve to get it". That is NOT enough. You need to WORK for it.   I've always wanted to work with animals ever since I was a child. It's always been my passion, and I'm very fortunate to say that several years back I was able to achieve that dream. But it sure as sugar didn't happen overnight. Whether it was watching every documentary and reading every book I could get my hands on,  building up as much first hand experience as possible, or working and learning all I could during college, volunteering, and even STILL while working on the job, I've worked to try and hammer and forge myself into who I am today. My managers often say "You never stop being a student", and I completely agree.  And when you work both with animals AND the general public like my coworkers and I (I work in a science museum, and many of my fellow staff members have also worked in zoos and other similar establishments), you NEED to be effective on dealing with both. Especially children. If you don't know something, they WILL call you out on it!  Which is in itself is an important "teachable moment" in never being afraid to admit you don't know something and find an appropriate solution.   Which is precisely why I get really frustrated with the mindset some people have towards not putting in the work. Yes, passion and faith are important, and can be great for helping to fuel whatever drive you have, or goal you aspire to.  But your actions have to speak louder than words. If you're nothing but talk and no work ethic, you won't get anywhere. That's like a sword smith  complaining about not being able to forge a sword, when all he did was talk himself up and not gather metal, stoke his forge, hammer the metal into shape, etc.   I'm hoping plenty of deadbeats come to the realization that Calli is talking about.  She truly does want the best for us, and this is just a more brutally honest method of giving that push in the right direction.
Guess I'm a Dullahan now
This whole song is basically Calli telling people to work hard if you want to have a massive success, i love it
Those jabs tho... DANG SON!
всем slaves привет 0:11
Those sick ass beats.. and u killed it Calli!!
The image gave me Masa Vibes-  OH! Can you do a collab with MASA!? 👀
Now i desire kimono Calli.
I have no words for thus epic piece!
this is so good. alright time to step on me please
i mean sure have my head i dont mind
142 v-tweeters disliked because their tears couldn't put out the FIRE 🔥🔥🔥
かっけぇ
oh man hella beat switch and musicality for this track. love her sense of form and foundation shes built her music on! forgot to mention Kimono Kitsune Calli is everything
Besides the song being absolute fire, who else wishes to all holy hell that this art becomes a costume cause damn it looks good.
Now I have a new favorite song. I've always been a sucker for a shamisen with some sick beats, but now there's Calli spitting fire on top of that? Other songs didn't even stand a chance.
humans aren't rational creatures. they're rationalizing creatures. most actions are instinctual, emotional, and the rational justification comes after. this means, the smarter the person, the better the excuses. off with their heads.
Right when I clicked on this it reminded me of demon slayer
I dig that shuffle! Groovey.
Mori we're gonna need to start digging graves cause you KILLED IT
Wunderbar
She just committed mass murder this video will probably get taken down
BOOBA
It's so damn good
Love it!! Amazing work Cali!!
💕💕💕
wow, say all you want, her lyrics really motivating (no, I'm not being sarcastic.)
好き！セクシー！かわいい！
Well calli you did it again
Kubi Kubi
Calli just committed a mass genocide and I'm okay with it
Anyone hearing the "Perilous" sound effect from Sekiro Shadow Die twice? Pretty fitting for this rap song.
How are you resting with these of high-quality songs?  Good work, Death.
The illustration is so damn sick
カリオペ いず ふぁっ〇んびゅーてぃ……
I debated for a good long while wether I wanted to express this or not and if I’m honest I don’t think it’s a good idea to but I feel as if I’m going to burst if I do not so.  I haven’t suffered in traditional ways, I’ve been traumatised but thats not really an excuse, and despite that I endlessly don’t try, don’t push through. I retreat from pain and hide from myself behinds walls of stagnant comfort and in the end? I just feel like I’m rotting like I’m some kind of leach. I’m aware of my talents I just never refine them even though I feel a desire to. I smother it under insecurity and a fragile spirt and never make something of myself and while it is hard to start that doesn’t make keeping at it any easier. God knows I’ve managed to begin over and over but I fail to push through the boredom, pain and stress of it all and it disgusts me in a way I cannot truly describe. And yet even though I know all of this I watched this video, which was a really bad idea btw, and I must confess despite the twisting in my stomach the whole time I still thought “this is such a fantastic piece of art” and I’m really looking forward to seeing what you do next.
You are awesome, Calliope!!! I love all ur songs ❤️❤️
ima be deadass here: calli is better than cardi b, in every way, try and prove me wrong, i dare you
Oh God please no, not again. Like I can't, this feeling. I really cant . . . .    afford to simp again! I got too many Vtubers to watch & not enough time. While also trying to keep a nice healthy & balanced life! (Jk we all know my life is not even close to being healthy or balanced.) Bwahaha :)
Thats why we love our Mori
I would gladly offer my head to you, My Queen👑
Take my head the upp3r one queen 👌
Step on me
Time to put this on loop forever
Goddamn Mori being aHEAD of her time!
Hi, yes it is uhh... 1:34 am EST, I'd like to report a fkin MASS MURDER
Oke this is the best i have goosebumps all over my body oh god
Daaaaayuum, THIS IS FIRE!!🔥🔥
Time to play this on loop for 3 months straight
Why do I smell the taste of burn? Wait I'm not making sense.
It might be just me, but I have a strange feeling this track was inspired by Demon Slayer. All of the references to climbing mountains, cutting off heads, the oriental flair, the constant references to "Katana-Slashing", and THIS line  "Cuz bet this blood be melted iron, but I still be like water" - This line has to be an indirect reference to Tanjiro & Nezuko Also there's this line "Take up the sword and swing until it is unbearable" - This line is another indirect reference to Tanjiro's training on the mountain with Urokodaki and how he trained himself so hard his sword was almost impossible to wield at one point. Also there's the fact that Tanjiro literally had to climb mountains in the story multiple times. These indirect references to Demon Slayer are amazing and I love them. This track literally eclipses anything Calliope has done before. She didn't just cut off my head, she damn near massacred my entire body and cremated my fucking remains.
0:52 love that part "Welcome to the mountaintop"
ive been listening to this for HOURS. calli never disappoints!
nice job keep on going
Be right back boys, gonna have an existential crisis and think about my life choices for a couple of month after that song.  No seriously, the hell I've been doing with my life? Thanks a bunch for the tough love Calli, my dumbass needed to hear this.
is it just me or theres a kikiriki on the very start of the song?
This song is FIRE and I love all the metaphors in the lyrics  God, the more I listen to it the more I love it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
あたらしいのまってたで～！
Calli: "Are you a slave?"    Me: You can make me
The expectation from her is not any longer low and that's a fact
I thought Cali's first song was amazing and every single song she releases is better than the last!  Keep making fire, Queen!
At 3:06 Calli redirects her attention towards us Deadbeats with the same message. 🔥🔥🔥
相変わらずかっこいい
Deadly Inspiring.
Another win for good ol’ Mori, good job queen!  (Everyone is talking about Resident Evil 8’s new vampire lady but imagine Mori Calliope in her place lol, modders make it happen!)
AYEEOOO THIS FIRE BRUH🔥🔥🔥🔥
I loved this. It really feels like you found nice a balance between your current persona and past one both lyrically and instrumentally. On a different note do you plan to release an album as a vtuber or just release songs as singles
RIP AND TEAR
Yes.
Calliope: drops a roast on those 'V-Twitter'.  Me and all the Homies: "Odin is with us!"
Calli: Where's your motivation!? Show it to me!
Help I can't stop thinking about the eyelander...                                                                          WHAT MAKES ME A GOOD DEMOMAN?
Doom Slayer wil be proud
Calli has quite literally killed both the body and the soul with this song
Slave III
This is fire!👍
sett full ap is too op lol ez 100 loss top laner more like mid lane lol ez ez ez get good
Yes my Queen I’ll let you take my head. I didn’t need it anyway.
I highly enjoy that more horror like direction, it was already there in other songs, but here it became the focus, with the in parts uncomfortable instrumentals, I highly enjoy this
Shinigami
TAKE IT, ITS ALL YOURS
Yo, I was not expecting heat as soon as the song started!
She said this was gunna be an aggressive track and she was not lying. Calli killed this track🔥🔥
This is a "Lamar roasts Franklin" level of "Vtuber roasts vtwitter"
Take my soul!!!!!!!!
Awesome song Ms Calliope!
" *start creating, stop tweeting* "  The Internet : *OOOHHHHHHHHH* 🔥🔥🔥
Speed
Me, not up to date to the drama: calli just bc your bird gf is leaving the country, you don't have to start a massacre
Idk why but this sounds more like a disstrack love the song tho!
This is so funky I love it
This is so funky I love it
This is so funky I love it
Someone map this on osu and send me link
These songs keep getting better
Looks like Calli won’t be taking out of the throne for a while
Can't wait for gyms to open up again so I can work out to this song. Sick, makes me feel like actually doing something with my life.
日本人の受け皿はここです。
Damm this was Lit
Another banger from our queen so here is another 👑 calli
@Herohei do your job aye
Compared this with Cursed Nights. Awesome confidence and development.
This song rocks !🎉🎉🔥🔥🔥   The dislike must be from the "no action talk only" vtweeter lol. Damn So many vtweeter triggered 😀
I've listen to this song for about 10x now and noticed that it's already more than 250k views in just under 3 hours. Can we get to 1M before the 24th hour?
This is better than eminem
Damn Calli, I see you're already back on reaping people again. I see you slaying a lot of people with this 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Eminem has been real quiet since this came out
See you at the top of the mountain reaper.  One day I will be there.
和って感じだけどポップで凄い好き、、
Me: "This kind of sounds familiar. Where have I. . ."  Me: See's AO's Youtube channel name.  Me: "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!"
This song is fucking amazing
" 1:09 *..Well it's average* " Better than nothing i guess 🤷
This was supposed to be just roasting them a bit, not burning them to ashes
Comments: "Screw Face Jean, it's 4pm time for another Calli breakdown"  Jean: "Yes, Deadbeats"
Mom❤️
Shut out and take my soul (shut out and take my money  .jpg)
new year outfit?
All your songs sound like the endings to the best anime I've never seen :)
THIS SONG GONNA BE BUMPIN ‘TILL THE SUNRISE. ANOTHER BANGER FROM CALLI!
Intense
That artwork is Literally godlike
This is a really good reminder of something important that slips my mind a lot.   It's... 1:22 in the morning where I am right now, but I'm sure I can squeeze in some more practice today...
Getting some mad tophamhat-kyo vibes from this one, f wording nice song!
Damn. That's why she's the reaper's pupil. All those pre debut vtubers in tweeter that doesnt make any content got their heads rolling on the floor in one slash of the reaper's lyrics.
Dang, my procrastinating ass burned bad while listening to this. Thank you Calli for waking me up ✨
daaaaamn who was in the studio because this beat is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Get ready for mass flagging by Vtuber TBA
I love how this song is underlie talking about some people who is all talk and do nothing, while we deadbeats actually take her lesson to heart and do something
Thanks for the fire, Calli! This song makes me motivated to keep making more content.
Ok GG she have best music
Ok this is sick
came here for 和服 Mori, stayed for 和服 Mori and the song, this is fire
Mori-san speaks what a true Content Creator is. Create, not speak. You must have your Can of Words have something inside. A saying goes that "A can that is empty sounds louder when than a one that is full and shut"  Mori-san does not diss Indies, she persues and motivates pre-debut vtubers and hope them for the best. Indie Vtubers, especially in the English Community, is blooming! The Vshojos (Nyanners, Froot, etc), Bao, Artemis and tons of more are getting recognition..why? *because they make content!* The content they themselves share to us. Nyanners? She is a funny chaotic cat that we love to see scream at sword guys. Artemis? She is the girl that you always end up talking with for hours! There are other Vtuber Agencies like Njisanji and VOMS that also captivates us! Even HoloID(who are focuses in Indonesian Viewers) captivates us non-Indonesian speaking community!  Mori-san has a known background and a good company to be with, but does that mean that "She is lucky, Just an Office-Pawn?" No! Why does HOLOEN got skyrocketed? Because we expect them to give us heartfelt entertainment and they deliver it very, very well!  To all not only aspiring Vtubers, but creators like Wrriters, Actors, Animators, or anyone: Please lay a plan and groundwork, and try your hardest and show your works, They are people that will always appreciate you. Thank you Mori and the Hololive Community.
Hello? 911? Yea i would like to report a mass genocide that occurred in 3 minutes 38 seconds.
You reap what you sow.
Great song, great message.  Vtweeters tends to forget even being part of a big group is not enough on the path of the victory. Why lend someone a weapon when you know that person does not know what to do?  She gained her place with honor and dignity.  If you, TBA Vtuber are reading this, decide to do something about. Then you will not be longer a Vtweeter.
Calli pls stop, i know it's your job.. but there's a lot of dead bodies on the ground
WMD RIGHT HERE RIGHT HERE
This goes H A R D .
This is cool and all but i hate to see people quoting this to bother other people.
HO LY SHIET SHE JUST EXTERMINATED HUNDREDS OF HYPOCRITES IN JUST A FEW MINUTES
0:46 Did she sample Guts' Theme?
Wow. Calli ripping into the Vtweeter haters.
Alternate title : The Bass And The Burns
Hmm... I like it cool song
I'm die. Thank you forever
脳内処理が追いつきませんが、素晴らしいということだけは分かります。
"You want a balanced following? Then start creating, stop tweeting"   Now that is an Exterminatus level of burn.
Welcome to the mountaintop, Dead Beats. We've got work to do!
愛了愛了愛了!!!!😍😍😍😍😍 Damn I love it  I can loop this song all day long. keep going, Boss.😍😍😍
This is absolutely fire, as the cool kids say
twitter can take the L
This was okay, it sounds like a demondice song, the beat and all, Calli should be Calli like with RIP but this one is like she tryna sound like demondice again, just be you Calli, imho
It bring chill to my spine,even though it's so hot,is this even possible?!
i honestly think calliope might be the first rapper in history that could dare to  front eminem without getting murdered by words from him.. mad respect.
awesome song calli!
Oh my god
“I'll say so long with a slight of the scythe and a light kiss on thy cheek.” My god.
Lyrics: ↓↑←→←↑↓ Me: Confused eyes
Sooo good!  100% worth the wait!
Me: *prepares to cut off head
Bloody hell I don't want it. You can have it. I don't know bollocks about this Twitter garbage people are talking about and I don't feel like looking into it.
Your song was awesome and the roasts were based, I also really liked the new instruments you used.
I love this song please make more if you want to because you are a rap god 😊
I know rapping is her whole thing, but she does have a really beautiful and unique voice. I feel like she'd be an amazing singer as well as rapper. Just me?
How did I ended up here
I absolutely fucking will Calliope senpai
Fantastic. Also love the shade thrown at the jealous whiners
Nice nc
She be setttin' errythang on fire, got damm.
You better pay me back because this burned my house down.
damn bro my house almost burned down
Yeah 🔥
I bet those V-tweetters will attack calli because of this   Well I guess I'll go create an account then
Calliope cussing while wearing something elegant like that really has me bowing down to her huh.  Please take my head.
When i can have this on spotify
I see you Matty.
I get to die and my last sight would be you? this is very pog
Damn
you don't want my head, it's damaged pretty bad..
Yasssssss🥺💓💕💖💗💞💝
I swear every time you drop a track,  my brain shuts down from sheer level of skill.
I've been waiting for your song, Calli... And you have not dissapointed me. I love it, and yes, I find it motivational. Thank you for being who you are. <3 Peace!
Incredible! Vocals are excellent.  Mix is amazing.  May even be your best work to date.
Holy fuck.... she called them out.
I kinda froze for a bit when you said mountaintop. I'm just... i guess ptsd.
Wow i never expected an anime girl to become my favorite rapper
"Ya want balanced following?" "Start creating stop tweeting"  Calliope just murdered million lives lol  Edit : if you want the timestamp 2:03
Me: *reads title: Me: *remembers the french revolution. And the amount of heads that were chopped off* Also me: *VIBIN*
Y’all might be talking about how good it is, while I’m here thinking on how this is gonna be the OP to France Revolution 2: Robespierre Boogaloo.
Damn. This just might be the most inspiring song I've ever heard. It's not easy to just be a content creator, and you can feel the unfathomable amount of work Calli has put in to get where she is. Success is possible, but man do you really have to earn it. Time to stop complaining and get to work. Thanks, Calli!
youre so cooooool
辛苦了⋋✿ ⁰ o ⁰ ✿⋌
step on me calli i dont mind
1m special?
Mori : Uploaded  Ollie : S P E E D
I dont like the genre of rap, at all, but Calli is the sole exception
Fire in more ways than one! Deadbeats getting scorched by the bars, and Vtweeters getting burned by the shade. I absolutely love it!
As our lord and savior Keanu would say "Breathtaking" is what that background art is
TBH don’t enjoy this song as much as RIP and live again but will still listen to it.
There was so many shots fired in this song it's unreal. I fuck with it heavy though.
Anyone else feel called out? Dont know why Calli had to come for me like that D,:
Vtweeters have been real silent ever since "Off With Their Heads" dropped.
still listening...the lyrics are quite deep. sacrifice seems to be a theme I'm getting and the motivational kick in the as$ for not being there was a big eye-opener. Basically, it's up to yourself to follow through and do what it takes..no shortcuts.  Sasu Calli. You definitely got 'em, me, za warudo
this is fucking so cool!MY QUEEN
FUCKING NICE
I wasn't ready for this fire
idk why but im waiting for T+pazolite remix (orginal song version sound good too)
Good talk, Dad. Hella motivated now.
I'm so proud of her that I started crying LMAO. Keep slaying My queen.
Whoaaaa
The song reminds me of the underworld crusade that i've once done with my friends against the abusive angels in the server
Chriss Calli, that's a solide one!
Absolute fire
bruh moment
them heads be rolling yo!  also that goddamn beat, it was so good, the pitch was perfect!
If they ever make a figure based off of the illustration, call me
I need spicy
I would die for you my Reaper   *bows*
The lyrics are cool and the beat is cool as well. Please enlighten me, death.
That's now my fav song, rly no kidding o_0
Calli song is jam it🎸
Thanks a lot, Calli ❤️🔥🎶 It's certainly more aggressive, really burrowed itself into my ear and won't come out. Ok, now I know what I'll listen to the whole day long🎵🎶🎵🎶🔥🔥🔥
This song is dang good🔥🔥
Throwing shade and swinging that heavy scythe while spitting fire left and right, Calli's new song's meant to burn the living, the dead and everyone along. She ended all pretenders, offenders and unpassionate vtuber descendants by simply asking "what's the use of a body for a head that does not act to get ahead?"  And thus, I mirror her question: is there even a need to mention all the attention that laughable pretension is giving to the aforementioned congregation, when a simple action (and not a retraction) with the intent of gaining enough traction to elicit a positive reaction is sure to bring us all satisfaction?  If her words go unheeded, it's not because they're unneded but probably superceded by both fear and regret, lest we forget we all started in the red and the climb out of the net of the inaction mindset required our very own initial step (which was more like a bet), and through slips and falls and tears and joys we learned about courage, about practice, about perfection and such antics.  So yeah: this song is about tough love, but love nonetheless. 'Cuz at the end of the day, you're responsible for your success.     Gotta admit, I had fun writing this

Thx, I hear this I loops for for half an hour alright, and I think I entered my gamer "zone" cuz I didn't lost in rankings one time, usually I die fast(sry can't tell what game tho :) )
Banger
Jam on queen
I love this style of rap so much. I could listen to Reaper Rap on repeat relentlessly.
2:03   Yo!!! You deserve a fricking glass of choco milk, Calli! Cause you're fricking awesome!
Me and the boys sitting in prechat sitting for 3 hours:
can't wait for someone to make a cover with hard samisen in it
なんて言ってるのかわからないけどとにかくカッコいい。
This is great
Y'all heard Mori, time to get back on that grind. We swinging scythes 'til our hands bleed.
Oh...hoh....something has awakened within me......
I think this is my favorite one yet
Фига нифига, одобряем ✌️🤡
Well, you heard the red queen.. Chop, chop!
I support you from Japan! Please keep doing a good job! I'm sorry for my bad English.
Slay it Queen Calli!
Envytubers Seething
Altho I'm not a Vtuber or Vtwitter. This song give me motivation to do what i want to do! I want to make a fanart for all the Vtuber that I know and hope that I can finish it this year. This song just fire my mood up! See you on MOUNTAINTOP Queen!    Also here, take my head XD
If you will live inside my head I would gladly pay your rent miss
Rawr (This is the kind of music we dragons Dragon Dance too)
IT'S SOO GOOD
You must show you are capable of delivering to get hired Hololive: hires calli Calli: delivers Twitter: **surprised pikachu face**
yes waiting this new song on spotify, totally gonna play it everyday
最高
One hour. 250k views. Seems about right for Calli.
YOOOO
This song essentially takes the lyric that says "I'm a workaholic business lady gettin' sh*t done" from _Could You Please RIP_ and turns it against the listener in a motivational way. Quite brilliant! I'm sure many "dead beats" will find it useful and get to work. That line dissing Death sensei is rather interesting... one dead beat to rule them all!
Sound like one of those fnaf songs
日本人 ↓
As someone who debuted and just started going, didn't do too much of the hyping up, this song makes me smile. I can truly say that doing youtube full time is hard as hell. I hardly get to streaming everyday so those that do this and have a job have gained my respect. Streaming has humbled me in a way I didn't expect, I did it in the past but that was while I was younger. Now that I have to work, oh man, streaming is fun but exhausting!
Woah, okay, you fucking killed us dude
WOOOOOOO! Now that's some heat!
Okay, i love this...
Please be my "algojo"
Calli beat those vtweeter with grace, goddamn daughter.  10/10
She literally just killed V-tweeters.
Here before YouTube disables the comment section like they've done with almost every other song on the website.
This is what you call hip-hop not just some mumble raps.
I have been never into rap until I met mori
Damn she throwing out Scythes now, a clear shot towards those wanna-bee vtubers that don't put the work in and just peddle on trashing other tubers.
are those red spider lilies on her head? because if yes that's cool, red spider lilies are the death flower
HELL YES!
The lyrics remind me a bit of Eminem tracks like “Survival”, “Won’t Back Down”, or “Til I Collapse”. But the style is very much her own unique sound. I’d go so far as to say this was a big step up from her first track. I’m not as big a rap fan as I used to be, but I’m definitely looking forward to seeing more from the reaper’s apprentice!
i don't know why but your voice is sounds super similar to DEMONDICE.
She put in all this work to get to a million subs just so that she could finally have an excuse to roast the entire vtweeting community.   Well played Calli, epic stonks.
love this song i am going to save this
MY HEAD IS YOURS, HEAD OVER HEELS FOR THIS SONG AAAAAAA🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I like the beats and the sound but I think she can put a little too much force into her voice at times
This is coooolll !!!!!!
Banger
Damn Calli got MASSIVE balls to called out those VTweeters.
ぉヴぇ　love
.... I wanna see this Mori Calliope lady dance with Rory Mercury.
もう…心臓の音聞こえないよ……
香爆
Nice
The way she can convey a message and keep a steady flow is amazing, she’s hella skilled and RIP the vtweeters
Another banger 😧😁
Fuckin, PERFECT!
完璧な和洋折衷、たまらねぇぜ!!
May I know who is the Vtubers that talk bad/ negative about HoloEn? For research purposes.
Ah, *tweetah,* don't hate me 'cause I'm successful, *tweetah.* Maybe if you got rid of those old *yee-yee ass drama tweets* you got you'd get some *balanced following.* Oh, better yet, maybe Deadbeats'll start following you if you ever start making high-effort content with that vtuber model you're fucking with.   𝒯𝓌𝑒𝑒𝓉𝒶𝒽...
❤
Moris voice and style reminds me of demondice
i am glad to see content about the reality of the Vtuber industry, but i hope fellow fans do not focus too much on flaming the “Vtweeters”, and instead on how Calli wants to portray how hard every Vtuber works to get to where they are. This shouldn’t be a diss track towards a couple Vtweeters, but instead a call for respect towards Hololive talents and other successful Vtubers.  We already know how people need this understanding, from the rude chat behaviours to the offhand comments hating Hololive talents for “earning thousands just by sitting there”.
wow, calm down woman
Calli? Your Dullahan army is ready for inspection.
Five words: THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FUCKING FANTASTIC!
This song was mid tier compared to the others but i like that you're experimenting with different genres
Not really sure why, but it's now my workout music.
"start creating, stop tweeting" Calli calling out the Vtweeter haters.
Best lyrics I've seen from you so far. Production was incredible. Love it.
The dislikes are from all the haters she just obliterated
That was awesome Calli! Definitely agree with what you said in your stream yesterday:   "And if you worry all the time about whose going to be offended by what you make, you'll just become a piece of cardboard."  Really like how you aren't afraid to make people upset and just be yourself during streams. Also like that this song can apply to my own goals in life and will use it as another way to stay inspired and follow my dreams despite the challenges.
This is melting my brain but please send no help, I wanna die like this
holy FUCK. I honestly wasn't expecting this much fire.  I knew it was gonna be "good", but this song just grabbed me by the scruff of my collar and smacked me back and forth across the face for over 3 1/2 minutes. gatDAMN WOMAN.
"Off with their heads" Dunno what I'm thinking but I'm half expecting there's dancing dog in this vid.
This reminds me of little nightmares IDK
Absolutely killer, music sounds maybe a little loud compared to vocals? but damn this slaps really hard
okay I did not expect the song to start off so hard right away damn
OMG/////
Was having a sad day, this song turned my frown into a smile. Thank you Calli, you set my soul on fire.
Oh I see, this is Calliope "Kamikaze" track for the vtweeters "debut tba" kids 😂
Oni Calli is so hot ang cute
i was more distracted by how good the art was and imagining how hot and amazing calli would look like in those clothes  nontheless, fantastic song
Heck yeah
My god that was so good
Wow, I was not expecting her to throw that kind of vicious shade at the v-tweeters. Bravo!
Will the real grim shady please stand up?
The caption is so f*cking well made
The song burns so much that not even ashes remain from the haters HAHA GO KILL IT CALLI! We’re so so proud of you! Please enjoy your trip with Kiara!
Stop! Stop! Their already dead Calli!
Best song yet, Mori never lets us down with new music! Dead beat FOREVER!
Man the range of your tracks throws me for a loop in the best of ways, girl.  Keep spittin that fire and those facts cause you deserve all the love you get for all the hardwork and dedication you put in your craft.
"start creating, stop tweeting" BARS MAM SPEAKING FAX
The music is definitely good so the illust is top tier 🔥
She looks like the lower demon 6 from demon slayer :))))
this song is hella heat
k
Why does this give me "alice in wonderland" vibes?
bruh this is a straight diss.. she did not hold back
the production on this is absolutely crazy
Damn i late sorry but very nice song
Someone bring water asap 'cause this is fire
Calli really gives me the same vibes as JT Music, and I love it.
Nice.
This is gonna be stuck in my head for an entire week, CRAP'S SAKE
New era of diss tracks comin' right up
Calli still slaying even on reaper hiatus.
Calli❤
Allow me to slip in this comment section
BASED QUEEN
You make me want to do better, Calli. The fire I feel beneath me to stream and grow is not an option, even with working and dealing with mental illness. I need it as much as my small community needs me, but it can be discouraging. Thank you for the wake up call, encouragement, and signal to keep going. You are a blessing to this community and your hard work shows.
シンプルに最&高
She looks like FGO Tamamo
Now that was some Hellfire right there
The beat dropped harder than my grades
Roasting part aside, *God she's beautiful and this song is beautiful*
"No ambition, try again next week"   Bet it'll be the exact same thing for em the week after. No ambition, period.
Cant wait to see HeroHei use this song as an example against Vtweeters.
wake up babe calli dropped
124 dislikes by "Vtweeters" who feel personally attacked lol.
The EN VT Debut TBAs be in damage control. -Fire Emojis-
very noice
straight up murdering vtweeters
Omg CC surprised me
かっこいい
F YOU YT NOTIFS YOU FAILED MEEEE
aight, imma die now
This butters my toast
These dislikes are from these twitter vtubers
TAKE MY HEAD MY QUEEN
Are you going to be home for dinner tonight or tomorrow night to get me a picture of the best in the day and I will be in a Dr pepper and a half of your own place and I will have to get back to work on Monday and I will have to get back to the office and get me a 2 for the rest of my favorites and
Thanks for motivation o reaper queen.
I picture Calli as the type of girl that would laugh at your funeral.  Then hits up the snack bar saying *Iam here for the snacks, not to grieve.*
Stole my soul and my heart..... GAH
I MISSED IT WHAT
“As if a million skeletons hit that subscribe for satire” BRUH. *Flatlines*
" you all want balanced following? Start creating, stop tweeting" I'm dying to see how many Vtweeters were slayed today haha
I don't get the context of this, I see people talking about the vtubers on twitter, and I don't go to twitter so much, can someone explain to me?
"Send them away, Death-sensei"  eyy no Calli I prefer u wtf
Me and the boys boppin till the sunrise
TBA Vtweeters are on fire
Death-Sensei: Calliope, you can't murder anyone while you are with HoloLive. Calli: *causes a VTweeter genocide.*
i can smell the hero hei video coming...
I've always wanted to die, now I found someone who could kill me. Please do it Queen.
Calli posting this song at night knowing this song will keep our heads rolling to sunrise
Eminem been real quiet since this dropped
Boi, 😶, she is slaying. The lyrics, dissing that group.... Based Mori, very good. (Tbh at first I was like hemmm, what did I miss? Listen the second time, reading the lyrics. Boom 🙌, based)
I finished the video with myself being completely fine....and my house burning in hell fire....
This is amazing, I hope this is going to be in spotify like the others
This song really really makes me want to die       Cause I can meet Calli
Queen of the hill, CallieP, once again slaying nay-slayers left and right Spitting hot advice and cutting folks down to a reasonable height Here's hopin' they learn to shut their mouths and open their ears Else this fire's gonna burn them to the Deadbeats' cheers 🔥💀💦🔥 🚒
somebody call joey and Josh, they'll have a field day with this hahahaha
Please reap Froggo's soul next.
Incredible song, and love the artwork.
Grim Shady at it again
Thanks for the motivation Calli! 🔥🔥🔥
Do I hear Gawr's voice in there somewhere or am I crazy?
She will take your soul, one way or another
You never cease to impress me, ms.reaper
See i knew staying up till 1am on a school night would be worth it
First I'd just like to say how proud of you I am, you started out as someone who didn't have confidence in themselves to telling others to have confidence.  You've been humbled by the world and now you are humbling those who either refuse to work for it or those that need to tough love.  I'm so proud of who you've become and how sure of yourself you are.  You're using your new found following to inspire others to step up. You've earned the right to brag and yet you do it in such a way that makes others try harder.  We'll done on 1 million, here's to another for you Dad.
What an awesome song, time to listen to this all day lol
:o
Calli in her songs:💀☠️🗡🚬⚔️💣🖤 Calli on stream:🤗💕❤️🌸🌷✨💖
Track so fire I could use it to melt the ice on my driveway
Prove you were here before 1M.
Ok thats lit af, calli you can kill me now
Are you sure you shouldn't be spelling your name as 辛いオピ?
Geez. This be how to burn the anti's in one swoop.
My Queen ❤❤❤
They better stop drop and roll cause a firestorm's coming for their tweetin' asses.
FIRE
I was a fan of your music before you were a company hire. You inspired me to want to be a vtuber. I was about to give up before I even started streaming due to lack of confidence and my being worried about being a man in the industry. You’ve relit my flame again! We don’t deserve you queen. But this is exactly what I needed to hear!
That lyrics killed many ppl lol
1:36 omori moment
Straight fire as to be expected from Cali
The song, the art, everything is awesome. Thank you calli for this awesome song !
Writing/releasing this must've felt good
I always look forward to your music drops, be it originals or covers you always put so much heart into it!
こんなんかっこ良すぎて何もかも奪い去ってほしくなってしまうわ なんらなら魂も自分から捧げt...
Ooohhhh boi! Can’t wait to hear “their” take on this. Lets give it a few hours and that Bird chirp website will be full of salt hahahaha
Cantaloupe, you are showing your true self in your song, chill out.
i have never heard a song of this calibur before
Soon: Utaite's covers.
If I ever visited japan and pass by a girl who gives me the sudden uncontrollable urge to kneel to her, I think i know it'll be you Calli  Cuz she about ended careers right here
Mori, you've burnt my house down multiple times now. I can't afford this.
Calli in Deadbeats: I curse because I am an amateur.  Calli in this song: (only curses once or twice because she no longer views herself as an amateur)  That was a nearly imperceptible flex and it is the only thing I am going to be thinking about for the next week and a half.
I like her wordplay, it is nice. Also it is funny she is taking shots to those haters who said that her music is not fire. LOL. I like that energy Cantaloupe, keep it up.
HEADED HERE STRAIGHT AFTER CLASS! I love it! It's perfect!
I think that "I'm just tired of all the talkers I'm beating" just has so much power and really resonates with the mountaintop theme. Like "Get up here and then you can try to speak. Not that I'll listen" It really must be lonely to be invincible.
You said you were on a Reaper hiatus and you slay all the Vtweeters like this! Lying is bad, Calli (/ =ω=)/
This was a banger!
👍👍😆
I just woke and and was still super whoozy when I clicked on the notification. The flow and bars woke me the hell up. Friggin love this.
soy el unico que escucha quizas algunas referencias a 'Hamilton'??
very cool
Aight, get your shovel up. We have bodies to bury.
This so good I need it on spotify now
This is absolutely amazing.
"I'm a reaper on a hiatus" So that was a fking lies
Reaper back from hiatus i see
Damn.. That gave me shivers. I could feel all that explosive rage, properly contained in her work where no words, other's delusion and jealousy couldn't scratch her. It hurt my soul and I wasn't even the target. So extra proud to be a deadbeat right now. Your song blew me away. Love you dad
This song can live in my head rent free now
Sadistic Sakura should be Callis Nickname when she decides to destroy someone with her bars. I know that this is supposed to be motivational but she burned all the fakers on Twitter.
Damm I gonna play this music to the  death
トラックとミックスAOさんなの熱いな…
A rapper who restrict by hololive, our favourite reaper Mori Calliope
Her voice is so fucking cool
Love her music. TOP TIER!!
No ambition... Try again next week
yoooo I can't stop listening
Man this is your best track yet! Looking forward to more of your work!
New title unlocked: pre debute twitter vtuber killer
The only way I can describe this is as if Calli took a flamethrower and aimed it straight at you. The only way to not get burned to hell and back is if you get up off your ass and actually do something instead of sitting around twiddling your thumbs.
Damn Calliope
有能you know
Even Calli can’t top this one. unless....
you tell em lol
i'm die thank you forever
clean af, keep it up calli
Its Feels like I'm watching a Diss track and I like it.
THOSE SICK BEATS TOOK MY BREATH AWAY
Total silence for this master-peace, just one thing....I died listening to this.
Oh fuck this hit so hard
They call her the reaper cause all of her songs kill it
Why are calli’s songs so significantly better than all the other popular songs it’s incredible
"No ambition try again next week" I felt that.  Time to start waking up. Love the beat and lyrics
最高です！！ しかもAOのミックスなんて神すぎる！！
I get fake type vibes from this one. I love it!
Cool song. But the comments... God...  Look I understand Calli got her share of hate from Twitter, and yes, she did some diss tracks -somewhere back in time- (wink) but taking this song as "ShOtS FiRed" and celebrating random anti-Twitter hype ain't going to help. Those tweeters may be dumb, but they're still people. I can tell she's trying to change them, not cancel them, burn them, destroy them and all the things you want to do, while ironically complaining about cancel culture and hate.  Long story short, you got things backwards. Calli's a vtuber, not a drama-tuber.
Is this what scyth swinging lessons feel like?
“But where’s your passion miss?  I’m only asking’ cause truthfully y’all lose the heat when see in’ no traction.”...  “Those with devotion to the mission straight devour the weak. An ocean full of competition get your actions to speak”  Off with their heads- Mori Calliope  Calli really trying to inspire me huh, well it worked
F in the chat for every internet rapper. Damn. She really said that
very very beautiful…… Big big love
It's been uploaded only an hour ago but the number of views prevents me from saying I got here early....
I was drawing while listening to this      It burned and was sliced into pieces
Certified banger
GOD DAMN
Shots fired, pew pew pew, pew pew
the rhyme schemes go off, calli went crazy
Nicee
Its lit
I played this on my speakers and my house is now on fire and I may or may not have summoned a fiery rap demon. 10/10 would listen again.
I was excited for the new track, but didn't expect to be slain in the process
Imagine banging Ur head non stop until u meet death  Worth it v:
I thought you were on hiatus from reaping. Because you killed them.
Why i remember KDA with this song?
"Debut TBA" vtubers absolutely BTFO. Literally on suicide watch
I love you……大好きです……いつか僕の命をとってください…………
ARRGGGHHHH this song is FIIIIIIREEEE
This has a totally different vibe from the other songs Calli has made but it's so good.
SO COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!!!! :3
Damn the heat is overflowing
My ears are satisfied with the bangers this week
"A million skeletons hit that subscribe" Congrats Calli on reaching 1M, I guess I'm a skeleton XD.
You drop this queen 👑
This is just .. "wow"!!!
daaaaaamn ❤️
VTweeters be cryin'
Another fire track by our favourite reaper
Aye Calli this is sick as hell dude
やべぇ、トラックとミックスハム狂じゃんやべぇ！
最高です
Next to my albums
WE HAVE TO CALL THE FIRE BRIGADE!!!!!! HER HOUSE IS ON FIRE!!!!!! yubi yubi
Is this the same of that cursed Osu beatmap?
pog
Of course you and the other EN members are work very hard. Who said you don't?
anyone else listening to this on loop since the premiere
The biggest twist is ending a line with 'sucker' and then rhyming it with 'each other'
Damn this beat went hard, great work as always
i love how shes in hiatus and then kills us with this
Guhhhh *LOVE THIS!!!* 💀🎶
Now I wanna die and go to the underworld
Hot
The Mixtape is Lit that my house is now Burning into Ashes
THE JABS ON THOSE VTWEETERS LMAOOOO
This is a diss track to your dwindling motivation
this giving me FNAF vibes and I dunno why
Based. Dope. Superlit.
Yooooo Calli you really gonna tell us your on hiatus from scythe swinging when you dropped this track? I mean legit lets take a minute to appreciate how everyone of those dislikes came from someone who literally just got clapped back at so hard it might as well have been a Thanos snap! Great freak song can't wait for that store release
Fuck em up calli 🤘
im not sure why but i actually kinda like it. keep the songs coming, we love your songs calli
I really want to see what a nhato remix of this would be like.
Oof, the burn... It seems like not only the track is fire  Love your work, Calli!
🤘🔥🤘🔥🤘🔥
Calli just said Disstrack season is here 🔥🔥🔥 Drag their dramatic asses Dad 😭😭🙌🏻🙌🏻
I watched morisan for the first time. she is coooooooooooooooool!!!!!!!! become a big fan of yours!! I'm japanese. Is my English weird?
Lit
gaahhd the wordplay and everything just chefs kiss “I’m not’cha sensei but I been saying sense”
Message & motivation received. Time to put this on and keep swinging.
perfect.  love it.  love her.  gotta do my best.
My boi (x), queen (o)
Waiting on the collab with Snoop
Nice effects  E
She's evolving. Ladies and Gents
Well this is going to be in my head for a couple weeks.
It's this kind of brutality that makea life worth living.
Noice
i know calli is a reaper but can we just take a moment for cute Japanese calli
People are saying shots fired but I think this song is really motivational like the description says. Calli wants to see others succeed and this song is like a wake up call.
I think this song by far is Calli best, lyrics are straight fire, the beat is fire also. Probably my new favorite song by Calli.
Omg... Holy fuck this slaps🤯
When will you do a collab with shiki senpai?
The blunt honest lyrics I love so much, thank you Calli for another absolutely killer song.
fuck yes callie!!!!
Cali just killed all Vtweeters
Hi
I love it I just think the mix is a little too loud. It's hard to hear the lyrics for me at least. Idk just my opinion
Death sensei: Go to the mountain top to seek the most desired thing in this world *on top of the mountain* Calli: Sup?
KO
I love the way she says "Dead Beats". I can hear a combination of disgust and motherly love in her voice when she says it, which is probably how she views her followers.
"You want a balanced following? Start creating stop tweeting" DID YOU HEAR THAT EVERYONE
TOPMANHAT -K never fails to impress
Idk why, but I like it
The song and art work are absolutely beautiful together!
This song is perfectly for S T U D Y I N G  T H E  B L A D E.
haven’t seen anyone notice the fox mask from demon slayer
Well I guess you could say the reaper is out for blood.
idk who did the artwork for geisha ninja calli but they need a raise, and to work on a doujin
Oh damn, them Vtweeters are about to be dropping like flies
:)
Jesus fucking Christ Calli. Did the Dead Beats get too comfortable and you had to remind everyone that you're a killer again?
Goddamn when is this on Itunes?
Calli Has A Tattoo Thats Canon Now
She Looks so beautiful in a Kimono
Calli´s hair is like a red spider lily, the artwork, beat, and song is fire. Love your songs <3. Now it´s time to go to the mountain top!
Anyone else REALLY wanna see Calli in that outfit?
Sick rhymes. I wouldn't mind going to hell for this
damn you din't need to murder the vtweeters like that
The earth is burning by this fire song. I repeat, the earth is burning, especially the seething pre-debuted VTubers.
OMG
YES YES YES YES YES
I legit teared up on the part where she start dissing. Why? Because it's not just about dissing. Calli let us take a peek of her innermost feelings.  Imagine after years and years of hardwork and suffering, you finally got to the place you deserved, only to be disregarded as "the lucky girl who gets hired by a big company". "As if this back does not break over and over" "I near expired" "Thank god I'm death or I've drawn my last breath" "Take up the sword and swing until it's unbearable" People only ever look at your achievement, but never the grueling hardwork behind it. She's tired, everyone knows that. But you know what? She didn't stop. Neither should you.
COOL !! Kakkoii !!
Don't even need to listen yet coz ik its gonna be good
This art is amazing, This Lyrics is amazing, This Song is amazing, This animation is amazing, Calli is AMAZING here comes my next ringtone when i'll change it from "dead beats" in ten years
Cool song
Something's getting off, and it ain't just people's heads
This beat tho •.•
This demon didn't let the others to roll her dice ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Not only are my headphones burned and unusable but she also gave all these vtweeters a predug grave.
That's weird... I usually don't really enjoyed that type of music but ngl it's pretty good
0:38 Is she asking for another super chat simp war? Too many innocent wallets have died already, but more can be sacrificed for the queen.
Damn, I didnt know that scythes could burn, cause this is fire.
🔥🔥🔥🤘
This ain't just a roast, it's the whole crematorium!
LET EM KNOW
wow... really nice!
song: off with their heads lyrics: fuck you pre-debut twitter vtubers deadbeats: OH HELL YEAH calli: B)
Ok, this SLAPS
I like it. What more can i say 😊
its 4.1/5 on beat and about 2.9/5 on lyrics with well polished execution
Freaking amazing, burning them to ashes and doing so in style....
AOトップハムハット狂さんが手掛けてるだと！？ K'sさんの次はAOさんとは凄すぎる！！！ 和風trackと英語のラップの組み合わせかっこよすぎる…
🔥🔥🔥
Finally, some new beats to Jam and Slam to.
Gave me chills
Is it just me or is does the artwork give off some Bishoujo Mangekyou vibes?
Ain't called reaper for nothing💀
GOOD JOB CALLI 😭💗💗💗💗
This song made me officialy join the dead beats for life...
The Beat and the Lyrics are pure Hellfire
I love how much of Calli's personality you can hear and feel in this song.  Honestly this is so lit that it set my Fighting Spirit on fire.  Oh man it's already one hour and I can't stop listening to it >_< !!! RISE DEAD BEATS!!!  Thank you Calli for delivering us this masterpiece, but more than everything... Thank you for giving me strength when I was at my lowest. I'll always get my back no matter how hard the situation is, if life hits me hard I'll hit it harder and I'll endure the harsh work for something I believe in.  I'm proud to be a Dead Beat!
so cool😂 カリ様❤️ 素敵なラップでした
another banger
So Kute Deathsu
what if this is Callies to charter 😂
remix contest when?
She's spitting facts and fire 😳🔥🔥
Perfect  Too many effects haha
"Off with their heads" is an understatement. She just burned, roasted, decapitated and just outright slaughtered the Vtweeters damn. It's a fucking massacre out here with Mori just collecting heads. What a timeline.
Oh... That's DROP...feel like in mountaintop sh*t
I’ve been listening to this on loop for al least an hour now
Becoming a vtuber under a company already well known for their vtuber talent is obviously fucking great. But it also got drawbacks, mostly in the form of "requirement".  Lots of people dream to be one. Anyone with an internet can just start tweet as one. Anyone with a voice can just talk like one. Anyone with a couple of coin can afford a cheap avatar and truly become one. But lots of these people stop at step two. Even more stop at step one. And they had the gal to say any of the hologirls and holostars have it easy? They manage to fight off the hundred or maybe even thousand other candidate. A lot of them start off by themself, as just another candle in a sea of glowing star. The first of these girls, while dont have nearly as much rivals, they have it even harder. They have no base. They can do nothing but just hope either god, luck or algorithm favor them. They persevere through lots of trials, in order to build the base their junior can use. They all have gone through and fight off a lot more than someone that cant even take that third step.
S..savage...
deadbeats wooopp~~
This is really fudging good
"It's off with your heads"  YES MA'AM GLADLY MA'AM. *sits patiently for the scythe*
That was was heat
Nearly 200k views in just over an hour. Holy shmoly!
Finally, a diss track.
SPEECHLESSSS
Dang it this one is really good too
Like the Fire Ramen Challenge, my face always get melted. But I keep smashing the replay button.
Error404. Chill cannot be found.
Apple Music when?
Here's the thing, most artists have some amazing tracks and then some mediocre, decent ones. A lot also have bad songs you really don't care to listen to.  Every single one of Calli's songs are great. I have favorites, sure, but they're all great so far. Pretty sure we're going to get a full album's worth of songs that are all top tier as she keeps releasing new music.  Keep it up Calli!
I like this:)
2:18
welp another masterpiece
Good thing Ms. Calli Know that she's a sadistic woman, hahahaha joke.
Is she gonna slash you on your head?
Bruh this came out at such a perfect time for me. Like, these past few weeks have been really hard as I've been trying and trying to push myself out of my post-high school, unemployed, quarantined slump. I said I would discipline myself to get better at drawing, practice my Japanese more and learn so many other creative hobbies and I just... haven't. I said I'd push myself to lose weight and I just... couldn't. I said I'd work towards the dream of being a Vtuber but.. did I mean it?  And then Calli just fuckin slaps me with this banger, cuts off my head, sticks it on the end of her scythe and steps on my body while she's at it dsfjlkajlkjlkgdsgljk But it hit so hard, for real. Catch me listening to this everyday trying my best to work towards my goal. I may be interpreting it wrong but I feels how I feels man. Thank you Calli <3 who knows, maybe I'll see you in a few years as your Kohai :)
This is fire bro.
Swinging scythes by day, swinger parties at night
Since when does rap require auto-tune?  Full credit for the work, but it's nothing to write home about, so to speak.  I remember listening to her do something akin to, or maybe it was, rap god?  That showed she has more talent than this... but it still lacked _feel._  Maybe it's just my old-school heart.
crazy how its been about an hour and the vid has 200k views, 55k likes, and not even 100 dislikes
Such a fluffy song. I love it.
A banger as always
You either create content or you don't be a vtuber.   Obviously an aspiring vtuber should do the first if he/she doesn't want to be ripped apart.
This beat is fire!
Holy frick Calli why are you so awesome
Like a fine wine, calli's songs get better with time. Rock on sister!
Calli's intensity is very reminiscent of Hayley William's or Spencer Sotelo's singing styles. It was freezing here before listening, but now I'm burnt. 🔥
love it calli
Off with their heads, A.k.a: Sleepy Reaper tells you to get off your ass for 3 and a half minutes.  Yet Another Banger to add to the list.
Good song mori I've listened 10 times now
Simply. Fraking. AMAZING! Enough said right here!  TRULY enjoyed listening to this!
Daaammm this is gonna be on repeat till next month for me. Calli be dissin' haters
Blessed morning 🙏
She went straight for the jugular, bah gawd.
Yeah, I can swing until the sunrise, it's like 30 more minutes (staying up until 6 AM is pain)
wow nice you look like zero two
Billie Eilish if she has more processed music and rapped and mixed it up with a positive message
Pog
I invoke the Beating Dead!
Absolute fire
Damn she didn't have to do em like that, actually yes they deserve it!
So Cool and Beautiful 💕
Yo this is amazing  Calli i forgot to mention,you look stunning in a kimono
This is an incredible track. Thank you so much Calli for putting into words something that I just couldn't seem to process and simultaneously making it an absolute jam to listen to. It reminds me of something Calli said during Trash Taste: just because you work hard on something, doesn't mean its good. I think there's been a push recently towards art, and craft, an encouragement of all people to try to achieve stardom doing what they love, but it truly is like Calli says: if you aren't willing to stake your life, then don't expect to succeed. If you just want to create for kicks, thats fine. But if you want success, you've got to work hard hard harder than you'd ever have to work in a normal job. Calli has clearly seen a lot of success and failure in her life (death?) and it shows.
かっこいい！！
This is FIRE 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Oof, talk about a call to arms. Great wake up call in song form.
I’m an hour late >:V
Calli worked herself to Death to get here.
Quite a different sound with this one compared to the previously released songs, nice to see some branching out, sounds real good.
Overlord S4 opening looks pretty good...
やべ
So, after one hour, 15 original people are still on the page, possibly playing the song on repeat like myself. 53.5k likes on the video vs the 15.8k at the start of the premier.  I go to the channel page and the song has 185k+ views
Might be a new favorite, great work
The reaper is no longer on hiatus.
Go trend 🔥
You got some hard punches in there, I loved every second of this song. This is going on loop for long time. Even while it's not aimed at someone like me I thought it was really motivational.
i don't know why but m laughing rn
This beat is SLAPPIN!
That image is really beautiful. Love it so much.  Another amazing job, Calli! You kill it every time!
Everyone going "SHOTS FIRED"   and here i am going "Is that a shamisen?" "I hope we get a instrumental of this"
トップハムハット狂のトラックは強すぎるな？
VTweeters forever BTFO
Why is she giving herself more work? Because I'm pretty sure a lot of houses got on fire 🔥
Sakura Cali looks pretty dope. New Cali model confirmed?
damn
This song is about how VTubing is a difficult industry and a massive commitment, Mori wants to see others succeed but she's tired of seeing people give up halfway or whine about not being part of a vtuber group.
This Song is Epic.
this killed us, queen
I love you Calli (灬º‿º灬)♡
This is absolute fire!!!!!
CALLI IS NOT A SOUL REAPER, CALLI IS THE ENTIRE SOUL SOCIETY
I lost my side as i listen the lyric
me at 0:20  : don't know what she is talking about song is fire though me at 0:40  : oooh I see where this is going me at 1:34 : wow cali you really jabbed at them ...... wait you still going me at  2:05 : cali they are dead its okay cali they are DEAD already cali at 2:32  : let me nuke'em bitches just in case you know
I HAVE NO WORDS OTHER THAN I LOVE THE ART, THE MUSIC, AND CALLI I AM SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW  THIS IS PEAK HAPPI
those TBA must be shaking in their keyboard right now
Just how many has she slaughtered? . Love you Calli💕💕💕💕💕💕
Yooo heading to the mountain top anyone wanna swing by??
The New Epic
this claps
Straight savage loved it
Great song as always, Mori-sama! Also looking like a real SMT boss in that fanart. Love it!
Fire
Can you believe it?
200k views in an hour lmao.  Another winner from our boomer reaper.
Fireeee
vtweeter gonna rage hard and will say "cancel this". this time the truth just didnt hurt but literally buried them alive.
Lit
Can't wait to read a long thread about this on Twitter by someone who didn't get the point, this was fire Calli!
This is just getting better and better 💖
WELCOME TO THE MOUNTAINTOP DEADBEATS
1:55 "you'll say goodbye to glory. Next, hello to never succeeding" woah this isn't only for haters but also those who give up easily. Now I'm more motivated to attain my dreams and work hard All in all mv I have no words, truly MASTERPIECE The beautiful illust fits this banger!
I guest my time has come!!! This is freaking good!?!?!
A million plus Dead Beats offering their heads in unison to this absolute FIRE track!
I Like giving my Money to Mori
カッケぇぇぇぇぇぇぇぇぇぇぇ
This woman can literally never make a bad song. This track also has such a great meaning about how toxic and full of drama the Vtuber has become. Just as what happens when any fandom gets popular, many are in it for clout or just trying to expose people instead of enjoying the community. I just want us all to be a happy family, or in this case, spit some fire rhymes together as the students of Death Sensei!
Mmm~ The beat is lit~ Mori delivers yet again another song I can loop while cleaning the dishes~
I will give my friends head for my reaper and her wife
Amazing song Calli!! These bars are fire indeed :D
Ahhhhhhhhhh yes
ANOTHER BANGERS
not what I was expecting but i will not complain and I will probably listen to it 30 times this week
rap with a touch of traditional japan vibe?  SOLD!!!!!!
Oh god the beat🔥
Vtweeters got absolutely demolished in less than 2 seconds holy f word
That kimono is lit tho
Gotta admit. Never thought closed caption would be used as full on video karaoke.
Thanks this song is very inspiring  Edit: and it's fire btw
This is super amazing.
Wwwwwooooooooooooo baby
Yagoo is proud
can someone now give me a 10 hour version?
Off with their heads
I'll gladly offer my soul, queen
TBA VTweeters eternally BTFO
GOD Thats Hot THATS TRULY HOT!
ngl, not the kind of jam id listen to, but not bad
OOOOOOOOOO GODDAMN!  This up n' lights a fire under a bear, no doubt!  Good stuff, Calli!
I'm gonna be listening to this loop!
Calli's dropping another banger and calling out those vtweeters is *chef kiss perfect
lit
something tells me this isnt directed to the deadbeats at all
Straight Fire
If I have a Legit Criticism on the Song is that the BG music and the Lyrics ain't Balanced, the BG music is too Loud
Dang it I missed it. I had reminders on and everything
we need this song in spotify btw
Another set of bars from the #1 reaper
A Wholesome dead beats community
CALLI! Can we get part of the background as a wallpaper? It looks so nice
Take my soul, my Queen.
WHOEVER DID THE SUBTITLES YOU SHOULD GET A RAISE
Most Mori's rap is about dissing VTweeters. Here are some intersting lines: 2:04  Start creating, stop tweeting. Pretty good advice. She already elaborated on this in her Marshmallow Q&A. 2:28-2:39 Mori surged in popularity on her debut but there are people who believe undeserved because she was backed by Hololive's brand. While that is true, don't forget that Mori worked really hard to release her EP a week within of her debut and has been releasing new song monthly. Mori may have reached 1 million subscribers with help from the memes by being your boy, your dad, or someone who GUH at 200fps but let's not forget that she worked F-word reaping hard for it.   Bonus: 0:38 Basically RENT FRE-
Heart is beating 我爱Mori Calliope
Man, an enka remix of this song would be fire 🔥
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Damn, so far it s a nice 6 /6, every music she touches it suddenly became gold, holy moly, this music is demonic, almost coming from  the underworld, i really trust her taste, i can spin a dice, and bet that the next one, i also gonna like that
I waited 12 hours for this
Tee to the hee  - reaper rapper
That is some gorgeous artwork and dig the lyrics.
PLEASE HURT ME MOMMY!!!!!!!
Calli better get my head..
We'll gladly give you our heads, Mori-san
She looks like from that one arc in demon slayer....  Red light district arc I think
This seems kinda upbeat in a kinda “party hard” vibe
This is really f×cking cool
holy fucking based
This song is just * Chef kiss
I'm having internal bleeding inside my head due to excessive headbang
Oh Sensei Reaper.  You have done it AGAIN! Keep slayin’ cause you’re straight up killin’ the game!!! Much love!
my queen 😫😫
All hail Cali🙏
Calli's at it again, killing deadbeats with her songs. Here, have my life queen 😭💕💕💕
Make me your slave queen.
Nice!
The whole thing about the mountaintop and her outfit makes me think of The Four Devas of the Mountain from Touhou, specifically Yuugi Hoshiguma. Also, this is a banger.
I was here...  *Was just banging and did not know this was a diss... Thanks comment section. 🙃👍🏻
Awesome! I'm hooked on this song.
Calli burned all those Vtubers[TBA] wannabes so hard the destruction of Prospero and Presidia via Cordium missiles looked tame.
I'm a reaper -on--hiatus-
OKAY DEADBEATS LET'S STREAM TO 10 MIL
Mori: Welcome to the *Mountaintop* Destiny 2 players: Vietnam Flashbacks 😱
This is a banger
This track is a freaking Amaterasu to those Vtweeters who loves to start dramas Roast at its finest, this track is lit
Calli, you are the only rapper that I listen to and that I like all her songs.  Calli I love you, I love your songs🖤🖤🖤
calliope out here making a diss track to all those twitter haters and disguising it as "just an original song"
カッケー(*´ー｀*)

Speechless... No words can express my gladness.
"Wear your scars with dignity" I'm so proud of her.
I love when she make this song that have deeper meaning into it sasuga Calliope the Reaper My fav. Phrase is "Cuz bet this blood be melted iron, but i still like water".. yes, Calli is really hard working
Wow open the subtitles, im impressed
I'm digging the exposition in your song. ❤🖤☠🖤❤
I can just imagine this as our battle music! Motivation 100
Sick beat !!!!!!!!:-)
Ok... i will edit the video i has put on hold for a week right now, thanks for motivated me.
Very interesting in the different ways u Express each song, keep it up 👍
Calli aint Death for nothing
"Oof.." is the only i can react 😂😂

Powerful song. Great work.

Calli, this is my favorite song my you so far.   How do you put out a fire?  You pause Calliope Mori's track.
Calli always blasting. She spit fire facts y’all!
Aahhh ~~❤️❤️❤️❤️
Literally just got home from school and my head's be spinning cuz of exams
good lord that breakdown is nasty
Yo hell yea let’s go!
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Freaking wow! This is awesome!!!!
F-word, my classes starts today at 7:15am and it's already 1:00am
has a different charm from her "old" music and I like it.
Did you updated on Spotify?
Take my head pls
Calli slayed this song, love the visuals, i can understand alot just from the music and bars. Our reaper will always be rising to the top and carrying us with her.
Take my wares, Calli, steal it if you have to
So many Chads Mori you make my eardrums burnt.🔥
Top 10 People Eminem's too Afraid to Diss
Calli, you’re gonna raise the Sea Level with the Sheer amount of Vtweeter Tears that’ll be spillin cause of this Track.
Ah, yes. Hassan of the Verbal Flame and her new Zabaniya
This sounds really nice! It's also interesting to hear this at 1.5x speed
YO THE BEAT GOT MY HEAD BOBING INSTANTLY!!!!!
Tottemoyoki!!!!
Im definitely swinging to this until sunrise.
Nut material. Enough. The beat's fuckin dirty as fuck, lyrics straight up heat, so much heat a whole group of people got turned to ash.
Wait I thought Calli's on hiatus?  She just killed this song along with all those haters and vtweeters!
Sick diss track
This is just straight fire. I'm going to be listening to this on repeat all week now. XD
Heck yeah!!! Love the beat, nice song as usual 🤧🌹🌹🌹👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻Here have my heart instead 😆😆😆
FUCKKKKK THIS IS SO GOOD
I wuv youuuu
This song is so hot, I got cremated and reborn as a true Deadbeat
🔥
お囃子っぽいの入ってるしリズム的にも好きだな。クソカッコいい
Awesome!! STRAIGHT BANGER!! And lyrically it reminds me of Kendrick Lamar's verse on "Control" for how savage it is.
☠🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☠
Calli the sadistic Shrine maiden
Amazing as always!
This has gotta be the most motivational roast I've ever heard
Dommy Mommy energy
*YOOOOOOOOO* This actually *SLAPS*
I'm still waiting for the bread song.
JESUS! THIS RHYMES ARE  HOTTER THAT THE AMAZON'S FIRES GIRL, YOU JUST SLAYING HARDER THAT A DEMON SLAYER 🥵🔥🔥🚒🔥🔥🥵
W O W
well the rap reaper reaping again !
YouTube, for once you share what I watch on time.
Everytime Calli release a new song, my house is on fire 🐦
pretty edgy
Really looking forward to February Second when I can I get this on Apple Music!
Damn the song + the description cuts kinda deep and I think I needed that, thanks for this song
Straight up this is now my second favorite song from Calli right behind Live Again.
Automatically added in playlist
OMG!! I love your style!! Awesome New song!!!
I'm speechless. Calliope, you are so good! 💀💕
As always, great song!! Can't wait for it to show up on itunes!!!!!!
I thought she was NY Plumeria Edit: dang, the roast. Yes. YES! BURN THEM VTWEETERS TO ASHES!
I didn't know death would be this good, Hades and Death sensei would be proud
Aw yesss~ 💖💖💖💖💖💖
...this had to premiere while I was getting hit by the sleeping pills of course XD. I'll make a note to listen to it again when I'm more coherent here.
🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That's a lot of words to describe Minecraft.
All hail oriental bop
this is fire 🔥 😍 demn
Calliope has scorched the Earth with a new level of HELLFLAME BARS. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Calli casually cutting, reaping, burning those who are hating. Had to max the air conditioner after listening to this because damn, this is FIRE!
Kill me
If this isn't played at my funeral, I'm not going.
OMG! I LOVE IT
"Start creating, stop tweeting" Damn, you really had to go and give Hero Hei a theme song like this?
Here before it hits 10 mil.
Kneel down before the VTwitter Slayer!!!
niceu
Damn no debut for me i guess :"))
A really different thematic song compared to your original ones... like how Cursed Night was a more toned down departure from your debut songs, this song is a more EDM/eastern motivated. The genre diversity is really interesting!   In regard to the aspects of the song itself, I noticed that this song incorporates less bilingual lyrics, has very interesting instrumentals/sounds, and had a very interesting flow (?). You didn't use your "chorus"/"hook" that much even though it was really catchy and chose to focus on the rap bits of your song (and chose to use less bilingual lyrics)--which really emphasizes what kind of song this one is.   Listening to it for the first time, I didn't know what to expect, so I was a bit thrown off. Now having listened to it a few times and now that I know what to expect, this song has really grown on me! Overall, I really like it! I hope it didn't come off like I disliked it nor that I was critiquing it, because I hardly know a thing about music! I just wanted to comment on a few things I noticed and appreciated!   Also, I know you mentioned you were unsure about releasing a song like Cursed Night again, but I hope you now realize that us Dead Beats will support you no matter what you put out, as long as you're proud of it!
Banging my head until I'm dead
Pog
Calli be kiilling every Vtwiter pre-debut with this . . . . oopps those guys never even had a career to begin with But yeah its kinda frustrating when a bunch of people without content have much more followers and traffic rather than someone who really puts up content in the first place,i'm not trying to justify or  make it sounds that i'm higher than them but for real i'm just telling the truth
I want that as my wallpaper And I wish she sang/rapped in japanese more in this song
AHHHHHHHH
Calli did say she is a Reaper on hiatus but that doesn't mean she stopped reaping. She can slay if she wants to.
This Is absolute Fire. Going straight into my workout playlist.
Start creating stop tweeting hahaha GETTEM
dayuuuummm............
Rocking (or should I say "swinging") those internal rhymes, as usual, Mori!
THIS IS SO GOOD!!! I really like Calli's songs ❤
I am your slave
Dad really knows how to make a fucking bop.
Imagine.. the mass of slaying the pre-mature Vtweeters.
Wait, now we swing instead of jerk?  oh... ok.
my overreacted because of the Thumbnail... she thought I was a perv.... FYI I'm using sisters Account... and I'm male
jesus christ calm down  calli
This. Is. 🔥
Her weakest song lyrically, but when it comes to Roastology, I think even Lemar would be proud... "Yo, can a lo come up in your crib?"
I stayed up for this, and it was worth it. Keep up the excellent work Calli.
Ok
Calli just casually reaping those V-tweeters while rapping
She’s asking us to wield scythes too? Oh hell yes—
🤓🤓
Basically, "GET TO WORK!"
Damnit! I missed it by less than an hour. Fire as always Calli.
I'm watching it while headbanging like watame,  IN PUBLIC
BOOOM!
this is godly
waddles likes what he hears
calliope making a new song just makes me happy everytime she does
Increíble trabajo cali sigue así
It's hard to stay motivated when I'm stuck inside and what I need to do to progress feels tedious. This reignited some of my determination. The idea that I might reach the same heights as you is laughable, but I'll fight to the end all the same. Good luck out there, reaper.
Did you forget the bass on the drop? good vibes anyway
She burned 'em so hard that I can feel their pain from here. Ouch
Calli's super serious about her music and hip-hop and it literally shows. Absolute BANGER, Miss Mori :)  Edit: AS IF THESE MOVES DID NOT TAKE HEARTACHE AND THESE TRACKS ARE NOT FIRE   . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . I don't know about you, but I'm kinda simping now
How do you like your roast? Calli: 'I like them dead.'
This is dope
The art reminds me of the certain criticized Naruto manga cover.
Now this wasnt only a savage roast but also an absolute banger. Fucking amazing
peko đã đến đây!
Well, that's a kick DeadBeats need when they weak in knees, scared of climbing the trees, just shooting the breeze sayin',   "I could do it if I try, this isn't the time. I'm not terrified." Well now it's do or die, prayin',   Your soul was in seams, now you crafting your dreams, tearing down all the strings, from your chest you will sing I Am Here!
Another certified banger.  Callie continues to be fantastic.
Trufax.
Great job Calliope you definitely proved them wrong
SAVAGE AF
I want to hit the Like button here, but I am afraid that my PC may overheat and explode if I interact with these fire verses any further.
This is B O P
Yo, shit's dope. Calli spittin' fire.
ちょーかっこいいし可愛い
Amazing work, beautiful song, excellent singer and the best reaper!
I can't help but see her as a Touhou character XD
Da una sensación en la piel cuando escuchas  cómo arrastra la palabra "heads" al final. No esperaba eso y lo hizo aún más genial.
日本語でお願いします！ 何でもしますから！！ かわいいし・・
Sounds a lot like Demondice.  Is it just me?  That's not a bad thing but I mean she do right?  Am I just going insane?  Either way this is fuckin' good
Deadbeats assemble for our reaper
Damn that was absolutely amazing, vtweeters and armchair critics got roasted hard. Us Deadbeats all know just how much work you've put in to get to where you are and are still putting in every day. We're with you all the way!
So where's the button to donate my soul?
Nostalgic Sounds like her old stuff
すっげぇいい曲ですね！(ﾟ∀ﾟ) でもなんだろう、どなたか12ビートガバリミしそうな予感がするのは自分だけでしょうか…？w
i live again for calli
“Cuz bet this blood be melted iron, but I still flow like water.”   F WORDING BARS
HOLY FRICK I'M 40 MINS LATE ITS SOO GOOD
「Vtuberって喋ってるだけで1億稼げるんでしょ。」って言われることもあるけどそんな楽な道じゃない。戦ってきたんだ。っていうのがひしひしと伝わりました。big upカリオペ！
Hard bops ψ(｀∇´)ψ
this is SO GOOD
Great song for motivating me to get off my ass and do stuff. Also holy fuck did you just annihilate half of the twitter community
Whole lotta pre-debut folks are gonna get "start creating, stop tweeting" in their twitter mentions.  Got some awesome Left-Eye vibes from 2:56 to 3:04.
Bro I thought Calli quit her reaping job.
Better than Ghost Town; I thought it was a cover but glad how this one turned out.
Dad your song so awsome, it set my pc on fire 🔥
Everyone's talking about "start creating, stop tweeting", but can we talk about "I'll gladly live inside ya head but who the fuck pays my rent? It ain't me right?"
Absolutely f wording awesome track Cali sama ^^ BUT.. the volume on you voice is a little bit too low, It's a bit hard to hear your wicked sick voice over the music which makes my kokoro hurt... T T
I think a lot of people are misinterpreting "You want a balanced following? Then start creating and stop tweeting." I don't think those lines are meant to start beef, it's the "tough love" she was talking about. If you want to succeed, you've got to put in some real fucking work.
I will swing my scythe, 先輩, until I have no more
Calli: off with their heads Kiara: I'll give you hea- Enma: i'mma stop you there Ina: ENMA stop you there haha Gura: a Ame: Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Now let's wait for those v-tweeters response AHHAHA
Calli's is beautiful as always
God damn, another amazing song by our resident reaper!   Once again you have told a story within the song, which is one of the things I love about your songs!
So we get a peck on the cheek along with dying? Aight, I'll take it
A fine addition to my collection.
I could listen to this for a long time
You know I honestly forgot that she is capable of destroying civilization as we know it... but hey great song♡
FIRE
This is awesome as hell
this song is them fighting words, scru gonna have a field day with this one
It's my birthday today and this is my favorite gift.
MASTERPIECE!
Take my head, queen
It’s so good I love it! Thanks for the great song , Calli. You are strong and beautiful!
so amazing
I needed this we lost SASHA BRAUS
This is probably my favorite art of Callie
Girl you spitting fire !
I can't believe Calli lied to us. I thought she retired from reaping?! There's an awful increase in dead bodies when this song dropped.
Bruh, I'm expecting bodies when I go to twitter.  Edit: I replayed this 10 times and realized that she really was out for blood with this one LMAOOOOO
"You gonna throw in the towel and quit as soon as your body starts bleeding? You'll say 'goodbye' to glory, next, 'hello' to never succeeding."  Help! I can't get the alarms, in my house, to stop beeping from all this 🔥🔥🔥!
I gotta say mad respect that just about every song you've put out has a different sound..... I can't even put into words how audacious that is considering your debut has been barely 4 months ago. Honestly you're probably one of the artists I respect the most right now. Big ups!
This was lit calli ...
Love me some hip hop shamisen music
Not good as before, but its still nice! keep on great work!!
Yes I hope this is counted as a "diss" because couple of bars are there lmao
fantastic
I fricking love this. The first time I just listened to it, enjoying it. The second time I started reading the lyrics, and then I was imagining it literally (some kind of Knight that arrived to the Mountain Top and had to fight an enemy from leagues above him)  And now, 9th time. Ah... Love that it is quite literally a rap against those "vtubers" on Twitter.  I just love this way too much
"I'm not'cha sensei but I been saying sense"  Such a sick line. The whole first verse is great.
God dayum spittin fire amazing as always
Blood moon
o cooool very calliopog
Another Banger from our TsundeReaper.
Calli is queen! I hope one day someone is brave enough to challenge the throne only to get dismantled fittingly by the reaper!
"All like easy for you to say miss company hire"  When I heard this line I knew she was about to rip some FIRE on these vtweeters
great song love it great job
"Start creating, stop tweeting" some say that was for vtubers that actually don't make any content as Vtuber and just tweet but can be for anyone that just make excuse to not do what they say they want to do. Like me, I like writing, fanfics or original, I really like it but as of late I didn't feel like doing it as before. "Nah, maybe tomorrow" but I never start anything.  But maybe, what I need is to stop thinking too much and just... Create. This song really hit too close, but I needed that. Thanks, Calli <3
the OST for Calliope boss fight sounds lit
I think this is my new favourite Mori Song
Que temazo joder
Such a great song! My ears a blessed and I'm really thankful to be a part of this Community so we all can enjoy this song together 🥺❤️
Damn...single-handedly killed all the "v-tweeters" right there, she's scary.
"You want a balanced following? Then start creating, stop tweeting"   youtube might take this down since i dont think they allow mass murders on the site
Meow
"You want a balanced following? Then start creating,and stop tweeting"  Burn
this song is so heavy that i was listening to it on my cell phone and it fell on the floor and now there is a hole in the floor of my room.  *Nice* 👍
and that's another Calliope Mori BANGER super fun beat and the art is so pretty
Another banger.
Question: how do anchors work
NICE BEATS!
Ouch... gotta say, I'm not even the one being roasted yet I felt the heat.  Sasuga reaper
I want to add "Pre-debut Vtuber" to my username so that Calli will step on me every time she reads my name when I send superchat.
YO THIS GO HARD AF
you are realllllyyyyy talented!!!
yes.
I saw the thumbnail : I think Yae Sakura
This is what the kids call a clap back.
por dios creí que estabas en pausa de matar calli.... pero como siempre una increíble canción!!
For anyone wanting to know, it is at about 140bpm, triplet swing
me: sees title also me: *Alice in Wonderland flashbacks*
Bloody Pog.
I'm struggling to think of any words of praise because nothing I could say would do justice to just how incredible that was. Really, I just feel like Calli set a new standard for herself lyrically and said what needed to be said.
Let's take a moment to praise the amazing art in the background.
OMG THIS IS SO COOL!!!
She got em. She got em good. Based Calli.
i can't believe i was 30 mins late.....im a dissapointment😭
IT'S SO GOOOOODD!!!!
POGCHAMP
"then start creating stop tweeting"  SHOTS FIRED
Calli lives in our heads yet we're the ones that pay her 🤔
Forget tough love, this reaper was out for murder with those roasts lol.
🌸🔥
Ok one fair criticism from my end is that the mixing of the song feels wonky. The background instrumentals are a bit louder than Calli's voice in some areas. Lyrically tho the song slaps.
Julian it’s out 😁😁😁
Are we now calling our boy ''Sadistic Sakura '', please ?
美しい
Yamerooooooooo
By your side with a scythe and red wine, deadbeats swinging now!
Noice
POG
The art is so beautiful
Damn.
Oh God, How gorgeous
nice beats calli
Every song just keeps getting better and better....
Flashing visuals during parts of the song
Everything about this song is auditory gold. I love it so much!
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
failed underground rapper sold out and became a shitty idol lolol
Yes officer, i wanna report about mass murder. Look at all this vtweeter dead body!!
Fuck my life *GODDAMN* I missed the live somehow since it’s the only thing I stayed up for. The song is still good tho so that’s a plus .
Calli is so fucking mad. And I'm here for it.
Okay it worked,  I’m dead
Wtf calliope why you are so good?
I thought there is only one or two lines that burn the the V-Tweeters, but no, this whole song is about them.  Basically she said that VTubing is another hellish job unless one really dedicated all to get into mountaintop.  Great song, Calli. Great song. 👏
The beat is soooo fucking sick with this one
I like it. I feel like it doesn't have that catchy part that compels me to sing along every time I hear it but that might change after o few re listens
I dont watch your streams much, but your musics always been dope
Still haven't gotten myself to actually make it to any streams, but I'm obsessed with all of your music
Is it my imagination or, when she says moon falls, she sings a low note and when she says sunrise a high note, is it on purpose ??? Wtf
Wake up babe, new Calli song just dropped
Jesús fucking christ. Reminds me never to get on Calli's bad side. That was an Eminem-level take down.  My God.
Another fire track, but this would be an understatement. You really scorched these people to ashes huh Calli?
First Calli diss track then? Shits fire
Me gustó más la canción de Alkatraz, pero buena canción <3  Like
BOP ,!!!!
FIRE 🔥🔥🔥
I’ve been waiting all day for this. It was worth the waiting. Awesome as always you deliver the heat Dad.
" 'cuz truthfully y'all lose the hear when seeing no traction" "you can't be strong if you give up from just a miss in ya streak"  I'm in this song and i dont like it but also i do
I am so late to the party but MAN YOU POPPED OFF WITH THIS ONE  ABSOLUTELY GOATED
和風でめっちゃかっこいい…！！
I don't like rap but this is so fucking good
Gotta say, my arm hairs have never been this erect ever
This song is fire 🔥
Already seeing "Stop, they're already dead" memes, and I think that's wonderful. Congrats on a million and the new song!
_"Start creating, Stop tweeting"_  VTweeters : *why do i hear boss music?*
Maaaaan, i know how people say that it’s literally talking to them. But now I UNDERSTAND, how it feels, now I feel what it means to be scolded and to be told to rise and fight, or drop and die. Maybe I should pick up my slack huh 👀  Thanks again Calliope!! ♥️♥️♥️ Now I’m crying cause I can tell how hard you worked on it, felt it on the last few lines.
ngl this song is fire
Me gusto el ritmo de la cancion
This song slapped me through the wall, so I went "hey lets check out AO's channel", then got slapped again, then came back here to really pay attention to the lyrics, and got slapped again. Another rabbit hole to go down into.
Your songs are Always on fire Callie!!!
POG
i just got a cut listening to this
Very lit! Gonna listen to this nonstop now
Some rando:  OFF WITH THEIR HEADS
FEEL THE BURNNNNNN 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Как всегда, Calliope сделала что-то невероятно годное (As always, Calliope did something incredibly cool)
calli be swingin till sun rise on loop
Damn I feel motivated now. Thanks for the Music and your hardwork.
Yamato Nadeshiko Calli looking fire.
This song is a hard slap. As the description entails it, it's a song that hits dead center on you committing to the path you wanna be in. Stop squawking, stop gawking, do what needs to be done and be passionate about. Else it's off with your fricking head.   Calli, you rock this. This rap? It set thine mind and soul on fire. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This gave me the push i needed, thanks Calli this deadbeat is about to wreck havoc.
ngl gives me FNAF vibes and idk why but i love it
time to build the guillotine and chop my head off
Calli: Are you a slave? An entertainer? Ollie: YES!
This whole song gave me chills and the line  "Expect no less than earth shaking// When these dead beats rise" Gave me goosebumps and a grin. Made me pumped to push through the struggles I'm going through to achieve my dreams! Can't wait to see all of u dead beats at the top!
DOPE BASED SUPERLIT!!! joking aside this is really good and its open my mind if you want to be successful you need to put in effort and dont just says things and not committed
I can’t wait till this is on Spotify. I will be epic
Pic reminds me of inori yuzuhira just love it💕
The shade has been thrown, as the kids would say!
well damn...     Thats pretty good
カリオペさんのラップが好きなんだ。カッコ良くて好きなんだ。
Calli never disappoint me!
The bass beat so hard make me goes crazy
so i was thinking that im safe scince i baisically have no passions and just go with the flow but then i remembered that i was into drawing   sunrise comes in 40 minutes please help
I....think I'm gonna work on my music now. Calli's telling me to
Such a good song. Sad I missed the notification reminder, but damn she's throwing some shade at some of the hate and killing them with it. Beats fire and could jam out to it all the time
流石トップハムハット狂が作っただけあるカッコ良さや…
With how much I liked Cursed Night and Live Again, I was worried I wouldn't like this song as much. My god am I wrong. Slaps as usual. Fantastic job Calli, keep it up!
AOさんやん😢😢😢 全部バカカッコイイ😎😎😎😎
This is insane
Roasts aside, damn this is what I and probably many others may need. We all dream but do we ever put in the effort to chase it? It's easy to forget about all the effort and sacrifices someone makes when they've finally achieved their goal because we only focus on the end result.. If you want to pursue something, you should be willing to "savor" the pain and not "complain" (that line rly stuck with me for some reason) cause in the end, you're making progress, whether it be my margins or minimally. It's time to get our heads outta our asses, Deadbeats! ... This is also definitely going on my playlist for college-
Is she calling out anyone in particular with the line about tweeting?
45k likes withing the first 30 min
Good song , I still can't believe you got the million good job
Calli’s call to the Deadbeats to unlock their Conqueror’s Haki
好喜歡
Coing back just after watching aot episode 8 season 4, this cheared me up after all the tears I shed in the episode
Almost like nba 2k 21 next gen feeling and beats.
Dis good!! .. how many souls you harvest with this song calli?
I think I'm starting to simp
This was absolutely amazing! I'll loop this while working to get that MOTIVATION!
Its awesome af, I absolutely love the motivation I got from this too. Started listening to rap because of you, keep making killer tracks like this pls! The Deadbeat (myself included) will be there to listen to and enjoy them for sure
Please stop calling me sucker.
This is a Certified Hell Classic
That cat panned to the right at 0:39 seriously startled me, I thought it was one of mine making a show at fucking 5 am
Jesus tap-dancing Christ, this was your best work yet. I'mma be playing this on repeat for the next few days.
和洋折衷ラップの最高形を見た
This is An absolute pog moment Deadbeats.,
absolute fucking BANGER
Demn, she exterminatus every those 'Pre-debut' one.
Ufff 10 de 10 Menos de un día y ya consiguió un millón, una genia Calli
Im stunned, im frozen, this just... I... oioioioiahhhhh~
Just got into KING Cover by Reine...i might not be alive tomorrow
Really great work, I've probably listened to this 6 times already without it getting old.  I love the presentation of your harsh, but accurate, motivational message.
Encouraging psychopathic behavior is what us deadbeats are all about! 💗🔪
Amazing as always. Keep up the good work calli!  I wonder if you could collaborate with sabaton because your voice fits a few of their songs.
“You’re gonna throw in the towel and quit as soon as your body starts bleeding?” Goddamn calli fuckin ruthless
I love this song💕🎶
Thank you Calli for this amazing song, now I understand why you said this song is about some tough love. Also please enjoy your vacation with Kiara. ❤❤❤
yes please take my head
This song is heat 🔥
My jaw just dropped lower than the floor. Pretty sure its broken.
Lit🔥🔥🔥🔥
5 listens in and I am loving all the sound effects in the mix especially the...臓物 ones XD (shout out to Korone for the best Japanese lessons :D )
People talk about the twitter diss, but on the other hand, CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW DOPE THE ART IS?!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is such a great experience. It feels like Mori's just going at her own flow, and the beat exists to fit to her, while most songs in general struggle with. The only thing I have to compare it to is when you've got a good feel of the music in Muse dash, and you don't even think about how the notes are coming at you, or that you need to prepare. It just feels like she's doing it so naturally.  If this is what the student can do, now I want to hear Death-Sensei, and what he can do, though I have a suspicion that Calliope surpassed him long ago.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Insert cat jam
Dang, missed premier lol. Awesome song though, adding straight to my list
This was very much a good start to 2021, though I'm slightly worried she set the entire year on fire with this one.
Oh my Queen i want offer you my head, but Too bad there were others who also targeted my head
Start the morning with the sun heat While Mori drops these Dead Beats...
Ok, awesome
Damn she just ended every twitter vtuber's career before it even existed
\(oOo)/
actually bopping right now, even without a head.
The wordplay is so sick  Love the song <3
She's spittin' facts so true they burn.
engagement
Absolutely FIRE
Someday, I will need a merch from booth -- Either USB stick or CD or maybe a record???....And with all of Calliope's song on it I know...you can buy it in digital...But come on, that is what I want to put on my wall as the best souvenir I bought in my entire life!
I'm a little in love honestly...
It’s funny cause 90% of the ppl listen don’t get it 🤣🤣  Don’t get me wrong ion care about her I just see this in my recommended
I guess this is what she meant by a more aggressive song damn
Your songs are too good to not be heard, I'll told a bunch of people about you :)
BURNING YOUR SOULL🔥🔥🔥🔥
"Sadistic Sakura"  Reminds me of someone  who named sakura
Hip hop make you tip top
Hell yeah that was sweet, There's no fucking time to tweet, Weaning fast off of the teat, Dead beats get on your feet, Don't just fucking beat your meat, Stand tall and proud it's time to meet Your destiny.
YO THIS IS SO COOL! Calli's songs always makes me feel certain things,, and this one, gives me bop vibes. 🥰🥰
DAMNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
fck my ear is on fire now
straight to my playlist down u go song, this is lit 🔥🔥🔥
Absolute hellfire! 🔥🔥🔥🔥 This song slays
this beat is trash, that is all.
Yooo she’s so talented
Hello? 911? Yes, I'd like to report a murder...
I feel like this is the best release yet! Can't wait for what comes next :D
Calli's rap still continues to be impressive.  Thank you for this. :D
i like that calli has the official artist channel mark instead of just a tick
I was late for the stream but at least I could hear the song
sorry Cursed Night i have a new favorite
that beat needs a flu shoot, its too sick
和風テイストなメロディとサディスティックなラップが本当にカッコいい！ ありがとうカリオペちゃん…！そして改めて100万人本当におめでとう！ This Japanese style melody and your sadistic rap are really cool! THANK YOU Calliope-chan...and congrats on 1million subs again!    英語が合ってたら良いけれど...
She pulled out with the kikuo vibes
This, is, fucking, fire.
Nice song mori
already spamming that replay button

This was straight fire. You put in a lot of effort and it definitely shows. Cant wait for the next sick beat to drop.
Jesus Christ this is fire
*D O P E*
トラックがAOでテンション爆上がり
This song is so dope i love the vibe of it
So COOOOOL!!
Dad always give that tough love. Thank you Dad.
Calli just dropped them the mic.
Who pays the rent? It’s rent free of course.
Why does this reminds me of FNAF hhahahahaha
oh yeah this diss track is coming from a vtuber "with no career" amirite, ENVYtubers?
I feel so blessed
“Are you slave?”  “No I’m not your slave” “Then what are you” “I’m your pet master Cailliope”
The best one yet.
OKAY DUUUUUUUUUUUUDE
Tbh. Wasnt expecting this
I was never interested in any vtuber before this one, but i went into the rabbit hole from this one lmfao
Another banger <3 keep up the good workl
Unambiguously the best one yet. Thanks for the inspiration. And the biggest of ups to original Sakura Days man/Fake Type genius AO himself.
My house is currently on fire ever since the bars started
NICE
ok but aside of the obvious roast, i really love this message, if you have a dream, if you are truly passionate about something, take action!!
As always, a great song.
"All like 'Little Miss Company Hire' As if these moves did not take heartache And these tracks are not fire"   god yess
mori calliope: Then start creating, and stop tweeting *vtweeter's mad*            me: *sips coffee* NOW THAT'S ALOT OF DAMAGE
She may be on hiatus, but Cali has reaped some lives today nonetheless
this woman slaughtered every independent pre-debut vtuber and set my house on fire in the process
iTunes when?
"When season 2 is going to be bomb" the opening song
This is f*cking amazing peko!
Bringing the heat as always I see.
Oof spicy diss track. LUV IT! I agree, people who keeps Calli rent free on their heads must be a deadbeat. Calli can't hear your screeching when you are down at the bottom of the mountain
サンライズとサムライかかってる？ かっこいいね
Love it. More please 🥺
Damn these are good but never compare to Deadbeats track😔
"You want to balance following? Then start creating not tweeting. Im not hating. Im just bored from all the talkers I'm beating. And getting sick of retching endlessly from excuses Im reading."  I like this..  "But man sh*t, knowing their tendencies it's no use. They're never leaving"
In the words of Hoshou Marine, BASED. DOPE. SUPERLIT. Damn Calli this burnt my lunch.
Haha. Her voice is really amazing to hear. 😍  And the song rocks! 💀
this absolutely burns, what a way to celebrate 1M subs! ❤️
On a serious note, this song is so packed with drive and determination, both from yourself and from within us, that I kinda have to kneel in respect. You're so talented that it's dizzying, Calli. What's more, you have energy to spare on encouraging all of us to break our limits. At this point, I don't think I can settle for looking up to you. Your music makes me view you as a rival. Even if you never know it, I'll be here in my lane going just as ham as you. No more kneeling.
The only word I can say about this song is perfection! Calli's singing is always on fire and I'm meanwhile surprised that AO worked on this, their style are my favorite and I think it perfectly fits on Calli. You guys are the best talented artists
*just bows*
This song reminds me of Final Fantasy 6's Zozo tower or the Empire factory
OMG THIS BEAT AAA CALLI REAPED IT TOO 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Based
This is the hip-hop in Calliope.  Battling all these fake emcees (Vtubers).
woooow!! awesome song dad!
The tweet callout was killer, but can we also talk about the last verse starting at 2:26? There's a reason she's our reaper, and it's not from dumb luck or a handout. It was earned, which Calli proves on a regular basis. Keep killin' it.
I don't use the phrase fire but I'll be damned if it's not the perfect way to describe this
Our reaper slaying people that don't do what they should do is always great.
might not have flashy drops imo but the fire bars take center stage with the "tough love" motivations for them "no action talk only" haters, keep it up!! well thats my take on the song lol
I can hear Eminem going: *DAAAAMMMN GIRL*  With that "then start creating, stop tweeting"
Sadistic Sakura, that's a impressive and creative nickname that Calli gave herself, nice!
"Those with devotion to the mission straight devour the weak"  Words to live by
K now this goes to the nightcore playlist
Dubstep + Trap = Hybrid Trap Hybrid Trap + Calli = Deadly Love
IT'S EVEN  BETTER THE SECOND TIME
Damn i thought death sensei was really about to start spitting bars now i need a death sensei original       Also i understand the context of the song  Calli- Em Haters- MGK
Burning! 🔥🔥🔥
I love this song, can't wait to see more from you
This what happens when you challenge death. You gonna get slay
Thank God for Calli calling it on Twitter "vtubers".
Another ABSOLUTELY AMAZING SONG! Keep up the amazing work Calli!
This is fire!!!!!!!!!!
Queen of the Hill, welcome to the mountaintop
I hear you Calli, spittin fire as always!
Another Lovely song by the reaper goddess herself Cali
Damn this is fire
Anti Twitter been real quiet since this dropped.
love it. all of it. every part. Keep up the amazing work Cali.
Love the song so much Calli, you never disappoint the Dead Beats. Lyrics, mix, artwork are all amazing. Thanks for your hardwork Calli and also the people who helped you they did amazing work. All your hard work, was totally worth its an amazing song I’ll hear and sing all the time. Love the song a lot your an amazing rapper, us Dead Beats will always support you Calli our favorite Reaper Vtuber. 😁
Pov: you are reading the comments and all you see are people talking about how she dissed vtweeters
song yes
和テイストめちゃくちゃ良い
Very catchy beat. Fire as always.
wish calli will have a kimono outfit during her streams
CALLI WITH ANOTHER FIRE TRACK
This is so much fire Hell threw on the AC because it's getting too hot there from all the way up here! Masterful Calli! Inspirational,  and I can hear Twitter melting as we speak!
Calli is an inspiration She is definitely creating. Please keep making songs ~a deadbeat
This makes me think of the Hollow Night. Calli for Under Night In-Birth cl-r DLC when?  Edit: fixed a typo
Sick track, bruh
i will press the replay button till the sunrise~
This is such a bop
this is 'OOOOFF' song...
those fucking callouts oh ma god she killed em, didn't even need to use her scythe she was spittin to much fire.
Isn't this character development? Going from "I don't know if I deserve all this" to "millions subscribe to me for a good reason".
Wow! Noice!!!! You make me believe its nightcore rap
Oh fuck  in love laaa
Mori-sama! You're the best!!! #1 desu!!! I can never say this enough, I'm glad I'm a Deadbeat!!!!!
Anyone gonna talk about the pre-premiere chat spamming roses?
Fitting title: this rap's so mind-blowing it severs spines with the force
Es una canción exelente segue creando música igual de buena  It's an excellent song, I keep creating music just as good
its  Mori Calliope in demon salyer version .\'
And like that this banger has mad it onto my motivation playlist! Calli's amazing work ethic and talent is stunning!
Oh my god how is this so freaking awesome cool amazing beautiful good pretty fire lovely fantastic amazing wonderful majestic powerful epic spectacular I can’t think of anymore complements but these all apply! ❤️
最高！！！
Calli how are u literally always spitting fire
*Cat vibing*
Yeah She's no eminem nor Any rappers she made her own name Ladies and Gentlemen she' Calliope (The reaper) Mori. As always the bars are intact and slaps hard. Message pierces through the heart
FIRE 🔥🔥🔥
Who has the balls to hate on hololive? Or specifically, Calli for being part of it? I mean, twitter I guess
Fantastic job Calli, you're very talented
This is a good song for my little break
Love it
Always supporting you. Yet another bop.
My god what a slaughter, oh the Humanity! Stop Calli! Stop, please, the posers, they're already dead! 😱😍
Them: "Easy for you to say, Little Miss Company Hire" Deadbeats: "Listen here, you little sh*it..."
I'm late qwq
Man I love Calliope for being true to herself and pushing through any obstacle in front of her. Not afraid to speak her mind while stating some facts about doing something. So many people can talk. The question is if people can show it through their actions. This song is awesome for pointing at certain topics and problems. I will gladly follow Calliope to death. I will continue to fight against all my own adversaries and show what I can do. I will gladly rise up and bleed for our queen. Always be true to yourself and keep at it!
The beat is ABSOLUTELY fitting
Nothing wrong with being little miss company hire, after all, a wise demon once told me, if you can't decide on the right path, why not take two.
There’s no doubt being in HoloLive is more or less the only way you could have grown this fast, but even being in HoloLive wouldn’t have helped if your music had sucked Feels like people are begging for the spotlight before they have anything worth showing
Nothing but top-tier content from our Dad
和の曲めちゃめちゃおしゃれ好き…ってなったし英語の韻カッコよすぎる…… As if a million skeletons hit that “subscribe” for satire のとこもYouTubeの登録者100万人……ｱｯ……ってなったし英語わからんけど日本語訳がつよつよカリオペ節炸裂って感じで好き………カリオペ様首跳ねてってなった最後…………  ようするに全部好きカリオペ最高
Imagine an edit of the background for wallpaper engine....
Living a life makes sense now. such a piece of art, gonna make your eyes tear up.
A concentrated dose of audio hype and willpower. This girls dedication is why I watch her, she proves just how great someone can be if they put in the effort and sacrifices.Mori
Calli: "I'm on Reaper hiatus" Also Calli:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Yo this song make want to go out my house and run until I die, this beat with an asian touch and her keep swinging with a chill beat and a brutal one, I'm amazed if i can spell it like this by her vocals and lyrics, man I hope she is the one who gonna reap my soul at the end !!!!! Also more thumbnail like this お願いします (Onegaishimasu)
,man this is really a slap in the face to all of those vtubers that talk sh*t about hololive and undervalue the talent's work meanwhile they literally do nothing to be sucessful. some of them want the fame but do not have any passion and it shows. i do not support calliope because she's from hololive i support her because of who she is and and because of her hard work!
I continue to love everything you make!! It's a treat to listen to!
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOO
Legit, and no shade on any of the others, this might be my favorite song Calli's done. It's right up there with Cursed Night, which is good because they're completely different songs so I feel safe to let them share the space.
RIP and TEAR
*puts in MMO grinding playlist*
I am never prepared for the fire that Calli spits out. Great song!  Also, great art by ekao! The background artwork is very impressive!
Yo! She ain't a reaper just in name... Fire as fuck! That's all I gotta say.
SADISTIC SAKURA!!!
i want the spotify release
OMG I SEE THHK!
Calli = Yusuke confirmed.
that mask is giving me demon slayer vibes
Expected another fire song from Mori, instead we got an absolute wildfire of a track with a little diss towards the "VTweeters" thrown in there. This is why Calli is the best rapper out there, no doubt. Can't wait to see what comes next, but for now I'll keep enjoying this song.
Damn Calli, you slayed it again and I'm left in awe.
Dam Calli gotta say this is one hell of a song and also my new fav song that you have released ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wow this is nice
Top comment: 21 hours ago Video Premiered: *21 Minutes ago* Me:  chotto matte
Is music supposed to be this loud? I can barely hear Calli.   Otherwise it's great.
This reminds me of the living tombstone, memories...
"start creating,stop tweeting"  calli: "operation scorch earth is a go"
it's not my favorite... but damn, calli's songs always have something. nice
"Start creating and stop tweeting." Yup, she's definitely the Grimm Reaper's apprentice because she just slayed the VTweeters.
Great job with this song Calli, I absolutely love the sound of it and the lyrics are very creative
"Getting sick of retching endlessly from excuses I'm reading..." That's gonna leave a mark.
You managed to bless our ears, encourage us to keep going, and slaughter V-tweeters all in the same song. Certified BANGER Calli
This is a workout song if i ever heard one. Def going onto the playlist bc it’s HYPE AF.
the lyric is fire burning hell to some people. well that a grim rapper for you... nice beat mori san
another hit
I think I just witnessed a murder
Nice song🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That was awesome Calli!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ever since her debut I've liked Calli's songs, who knew she would reach the million subs in such a short time. Thanks to her songs she deserves all the success she's having right now.
Comment jus because to let this song into recommendation
Hype
We've been lurking for too long , now we shall hear her call and rise
The one person Eminem is too afraid to diss! Awesome song again calliope!!
Very nice
While everyone is talking about roasting ppl who are only talk and no work, i would like to take the time to say that i loved the themes of working hard to anchieve what you want from this song.  It is told in a brutal way, but nothing great is anchieved without giving all you have and even more.
someone's gotta pay my rent and it ain't me............. DEADNEATSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! XD
only been 30 min since the song released and it has 117,000 views.... calli crazy no cap
Calli ~you are so sexy and handsome 🥰 I have been dreaming about you at last night😁
Top 5 rappers Doom Slayer was too afraid to diss
This is motivating. Thank you, Calli.
I am not going to be able to stop myself from listening to Calli for the next 12 hour's straight... 😳🤯💀
2:04 "Then start creating, stop tweeting" damn
Bing bong ding dong, this is fantastic song.
Her hair looks like a spider lily. Its like her, a flower that is associated with final goodbyes.
Me not seeing SoundCloud link: 🤟😔
What a great song, this disstrack is fire, vtweeters debut TBA got called out, they better work instead of creating useless drama.
I got so many chills during this premiere and my heart is still racing.  This is amazing. It goes straight into my playlist. I can't even really describe how I'm feeling right now, but I feel happy.
"off with their heads" -- a line that is historically said by royalty. in literature, mostly by a queen. shots fired those do-nothing rainbow colored tumblr rejects that now like to LARP that they're "vtubers" instead of being multigender attack helicopters.  pro-tip: you can't "cosplay" as an idol. wear something and pretend and play dress-up. you actually have to create. you  have to entertain. you have to work.
this song hit a real sore spot for me but maybe thats what i needed to get motivated. great song calli, keep up the great work!
Welp. This is a literal diss to all EN V-Tweeters. Off with their heads!
It’s lit 🔥
I still can't believe this is the same girl who did not knew how to use the kazoo at first. Damn Calli this track went hard. Your bars were *chef's kiss * An absoulte banger 🔥🔥🔥🔥
🥰🤩😻 loving the song
I can't stop replaying this song
DAAAAAMN debutTBA vtubers on suicide watch
There is a typo at 2:31 "Easy for your to say," should be "Easy for you to say,".
This is fire 🔥
Where's Kiara's comment?
2:05 " Start creating, stop tweeting "  Big uhhhh
This gave me chills!
Love this song. Took me a couple times listening to it to hear that this is her calling out the people who question her fame when she has put in hard work when all they are doing is not making content and complaining on social media.
Japanese Goddess of Death.... +.+ But somewhere I hear nyaa voice.
Well that was awesome, nothing more really needs to be said.
Welcome to the mountaintop... A shinigami. A scythe dripping with blood... Standing tall despite exhaustion  upon a mound of bodies dropped.
Ummm new favorite I think 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The beats, the vocals, the everything, its perfect
Oh, nice.........
Is there something this reaper don't do well? I THINK NOT
The absolute mad lad did it again ❤️🔥❤️🔥
"Start Creating, Stop Tweeting" SHOTS FIRED
WELCOME TO THE RIC-, oh wait, MOUNTAINTOP!!
YOOOOOO 😳😳😳😳😳 THIS 👆👆👆IS STRAIGHT FIRE 🔥🔥🔥🔥 KEEP IT UP ⬆️⬆️⬆️ IT GOES HARD 🗿🗿🗿 FR 💯💯💯 BANGIN ✊✊✊ TUNES🎵🎵🎵 I LOVE IT ❤❤❤❤❤ CONGRATS ON 1M 👏👏👏👏 KEEP ON RISING 🔝🔝🔝🔝
when calliope dons the yaksha mask
not even 20min after it premieres and already over 100k views
I thought this was a new fnaf rap, I was wrong
Calli delivers fire as always. will this be an EP? Or Single? PLS.
Are you a slave//no//what are you the // the last of my sanitized race
Hmmm...... this is fire af
Welp, we know whose heads are off now
Calli really spitting mad bars while hitting this smooth flow, simply amazing!  Thank you death queen of fire spit bars for this Beautiful piece of art!
This is her best flow yet. "Naughty boys and girls get chopped up into diamonds, open shop.." Slick AF Mori
Damn. Just D A M N BRO🔥☠️.
here before it hits 1mil ;))
calliope never misses
It's a unique way to die, but interesting
I really like the way she frequently references the "occupation" of the space in our heads. It partially addresses the nature of online content creators. And it makes me feel violated, lmao. Reminds me of jreg.
What a roast 🔥
Me like
"Bore me, and it's off with your... heads."  Damn, I really love that. Seriously, Mori-sama really knows how to give it to people when she needs to with the tough love. That's why she's our dad
Straight heat fam
"Song Track by AO"  *My dumbass thinking AO was The Ancient Ones*
THHKやぁ!!!
I can imagine this song playing in the background as 1 overpowered character fights against the whole company gang. It's so cool!!
Are you a slave No So what are you  I’m nothing....
Damn Calli, this song SLAPS. Time to listen in loop for the next 4 hours
Calli is 6 for 6 now, all her songs her bangers 🔥🔥  Edit: forgot to say keep up the great work
The shots at the Vtweeters really do sound good to my ears
We need cory to see this, he'll give a good reaction i think
The only shame is this would never play on the raido because they are too busy playing terrablness.
So fire I could cook breakfast with it
The song was so lit I almost set my own house on fire. I'm not a big fan of rap but damn girl that's fire! 🔥
Welp time for pushups
17分で10万再生超えるとは…
🖤🤘👍
based, super lit, dope
Yea Mori Epic
That was incredible, the second half in particular!  I love how "real"  this gets, and I would love to hear more songs in this vein.  So good!
Speaker : ON Volume : MAX Defibrillator : CHARGED (just in case of heart failure)
this song is wonderful
Well that was fucking awesome.
Damn, 🔥 as always!!!
Im late but god is this good
Kimino, Fox Mask, Death Aura, Calliope. This is fantastic another one
Gonna have this on loop for the whole month
YES
あああぁぁぁぁぁぁぁああ〜！ノウミソ溶けちゃう〜＾＾
This song is fire and all but... when’s the bread rap coming?
I was kinda sleepy while hearing this, it's like it's pulling me to the nightmare lol, well I love the new song, ghod who rap like that? It's putting to much surprises in one words.. I love it.. Now I will sleep and wake up in the repears dean, haha...
Woah, didn't know the Ancient Ones can do mixes too
ohhh fuck this track goes hard!
I don't even know how to react to that, like ????? it's amazing, it exceeded my expectations-- today is my first day at a new school and i should be sleeping, but here i am listening to this bop in loop calli literally doesn't know how to make bad songs
This is awesome. Even more when some of us with the context. Tough love indeed!
Оооооочень круто! Я хоть и не всё  понял в тексте, но думаю ещё несколько раз послушать не помешает. XD
YOOOO this song its very epic. Calli every day you progress with your music :D
i missed wtf
You hear it loud and clear Dead Beats. Are you ready to take off and swinging you scythe ? For those who haven't find their "scythe", you better going off finding it now
You know Vtweeters are now beheaded since *"that"* line dropped....bodies dropped
RENT FREE BABY I liked that Doom reference too.
I COME TO FIND DEADBEATS AND I FOUND THIS
People who is simp: AMEN
SO BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!! Calli is the best love you!Calli!
OMG I LOVE THIS SONG CALLI IS SO GOOD ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Calli, I thought you were on reaping hiatus.  You can't just kill them like that!
Hopefully YouTube Music adds the audio only version to her page soon. Cuz this is going on the playlist.   And yes, I know I can just add the video and play it in audio mode. I'm just very particular and weird about my organization.
This song came HARD!       (and so did I)
BEST TRACK EVAAAARRR!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Omg I love way too much, I'm about to listen to this for days. Great job mori! ❤👏
Absolute fucking banger every time I love it
This song is a weapon of mass destruction, sasuga the reaper.
as always your original song is so fking good aransement calli 🔥🔥🔥
Video effects were fuego
I'm all smiles... It's so GOOD!
Now this, this is based.
No crying, no whining, no wincing, just take it all in and forge it into something to spit back out at them to a crisp beat.
I didn’t know Calli had the power to raise hell cause damn it’s hot here with the hellfire
Gotta call the fire department for this one! 🔥🔥🔥
I can see the hate from the vtweeters coming at Calli.
海外ニキたちいっつもこういう感覚なんだな、逆の立場になるとコメントも躊躇うぜ
If the grim reaper isn’t Calli I’m not dying, it’s that simple
You called out the ones who needed to be called out  Absolutely amazing
This rap is so freaking good. Seriously. You really outdid yourself, Calli!
Wtf Just realized why the beat is fire! I see why you were exited to have a new beat maker!
Ironic that the song with the most Japanese feel of them all is the one that has the least amount of Japanese lyrics. Still fire tho.
"As if these moves did not take heartache and these tracks are not fire!" Yep, people on the outside are quick to point fingers and assume VTubing is easy. I always love the story within Calli's lyrics and the artwork is LOVELY!
Calli's musical compositions never fail to hit their mark, strong message great beat and an interesting listen the whole way through what a banger, imo best song yet
Remember when calli said this song have a bit of tough love? Well it's definitely not towards normal deadbeats **Ahem** vtweeters **Ahem**
Ummmm... I like it but, kind off...  Like the expectation is high because of the previous songs, and its just dissing track, lol. But still lit tho
God, I love her so much... Ün ün ün...
Okay, that was really catchy.
dead beats's answer song?
Yep with this calli definitely goes to the step on me tier for vtubers
I need this on wallpaper engine
I'm sorry but you owe me a new computer... this one's lit!
And another banger of a song, girls got a lot of talent
this song is fire🔥
Welcome to the mountainstop  deadbeats: hi calli calli: guess what     calli: Off with your heads... 😎😎  deadbeats: (✖╭╮✖)
Is this a reference to England's King Richard III
holy s-word that beat was absolutely incredible, definitely my new favorite song
To “songs to listen to when the g falls from graveyard” playlist
So she really did become a shrine maiden. Kind of
This song was  absolute 🔥🔥🔥! Calli was able to out do herself again! Definitely got that tough love and hope everyone else didn't get too hurt from it.
I'm not a music enthusiast nor listening to music regularly but HOLY COW Calli created another person inside of me.
2:05 YOOOO SHE CALLED OUT EVERY SINGLE VTWEETER!!! CALLI'S BARS ARE INSANE!!!
mori mori literature club.....
This is the best track from Calli hands down. Ive been waiting for this side of hers for a while. Absolute fire. 🔥🔥🔥
カッコ良すぎる！！！"ガチ"だ………
Loved it.
Love it!!!
is it on spotify yet?
This song comes as I'm currently planning to drastically try my hand at creating new stuff. So it puts some wind at my back via hype bars
[ A ]
"but who tf pays my rent?" U can stay rent fre-     On second thought you stay and I'll pay you the rent lel
Words cannot describe how fire this Song is. Our Boi just can't stop making absolute Bangers.
If you think this will be my new 'studying to' song then you're absolutely right!  I'm gonna make you proud, just you wait!
Head lost, mind lost.
Your song was so fire, my internet decided it couldn't take the heat right in the middle of the premiere! Seriously though, this track is sick!
Discovered you few hours ago, I call that _perfect timing_
thank you for your hard work and talent😭♥️ we're so lucky to have known you😩♥️♥️
I literally can't stop listening to it, our favorite reaper did it again!
This is really breathtaking and amazing  Great work Calliope Mori!
This go hard, definly  gonna be one I can listen on my headphones outside bruh
Definitely my favorite song of yours so far, keep up the good work.
Yeay.. New song.. 👏🔥👏     💚
I don't know how you do it but you make me fall in love more and more with each song, keep up the good work, i can't wait for the next one
Damn that went hard. I got goosebumps when she talked about those saying she didn't work hard for her success. Calli is one of the hardest working people ever and has produced such amazing songs from her endless work. Damn this was great.
YOUTUBE, WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT THESE THINGS ON TIME!?!?!?!?!
It's so good like Snak the Ripper, Evil Ebenezer, Merkules, and Prada West.
Amazing!! Your songs are always fire and you always teaching lessons to those “VTwitters XD, tbh they deserve the fire from you since all you speak is truth when they complain and don’t take ur advice it only brings them down lol.
Damn, she reaping everyone even if it isn't their time yet.
Yeah Calli absolutely murdering the track,  but like AO on the production though. What a banger
Mori really called out all the Twitter complainers
Straight heat❤️🔥
Gonna be honest, I expected a lot... yet got surprised. Now I'll procced to listen to this until I get sick of it.
I just couldn’t stop bopping my head around.
Best morning ever !!!  awesome~
Welp , I'll have this on repeat for the next month
*sighs* calli you shouldn't be like this, atleast put several warnings on the start about how *severe* the *burn* will be
Waaaaaaw
To quote Gamer Chair Jesus: *"WOOOOO!!!* Yeah, baby! That's what I've been waiting for!"
*"Start creating, stop tweeting"*   -Mori Calliope, 2021
I love this song, the instrumental, the lyrics (and the shade thrown at Twitter "VTubers"), and just overall how the song is structured, its all amazing, great job!!
FIREEE
All I can say about this song is...          Damn!
Im pretty sure this a subtle diss track to all those V-Tweeters out there
Ready for the REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Mori that was lit🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You already blessed us enough with the endurance stream and the ara ara but this is just too much to handle
I'm probably gonna stay with this song for 2 to 3 months.
I won’t say much, but this released at just the right time
Y'all be prepared for her rage.   Genre: Hybrid Trap
Another hololive song to play over and over for a whole month straight 😅
OMG O-Oh God she so pretty cool M-My God she so pretty dope G-God damn ....so sick
YO THIS WAS SO FIRE
Pretty fire as always, Calli.
THIS IS FKING HEAT!!
Off with their fucking heads!!!!!!
ALL I CAN SAY IS... "OOOOOOFFFFF" EXTRA LARGE
This is so cool she just arrived like the queen she is, love her ❤❤❤
Came here expecting to get hit by a truck.   Got reaped with a Nuke instead. Amazing as always Calli💀
TAKE MY MONEY!!!
Thank dad
Love it! Love the art and music!!
Calli be out here giving her tough love to her jealous "competition". Sick fire as always!
Calli’s song about how much work she puts in and continues to push herself every single day? Hrrrrrrrrrrnnnnnnnnng madd 🔥
Calli:im a savage cuz i care
What a bangerrrr brb I’ll be playing this song everyday for the next month at least!! 🥵🔥
This hits different
Before 100K gang😎
and thus, this will be on repeat for the next 3 months or so
epic
No wonder hell is burning.
Calli just boomed all over the Twitter Vtuber Drama scene
100K VIEWS ALREADY LETS GOOOO
Not only is this song absolutely fantastically performed and produced, but it’s exactly what I hoped it’d be about.
Poggers.
Looped
Amazing! Love it! Just that the rythm never really change on this song is the thing that bother me.
Take your 'here before 100k' ticket  If that expired then take this 'here before 1 million' ticket
Oh god this is straight fire, definitely one of my favorites. Replay time
hard
imma repeat this 10 more times
The last verse of this song is incredible, and fills me with energy enough for me to push myself to get up and, well, be a creator and do something with myself. Absolutely love this song Calli, best 1 million subscriber gift you could have ever given us!  Here's to continued success and good times as us Deadbeats support you in the future. *clinks wine glass*
I love how you burn ppl around using your creation. SLAYY!! HAHAHA
Me: * listens to this song*  My brain: *Now do it 10 more times*
yes
"Start creating, stop tweeting"  Ma'am.... I'm too depressed to even have a Twitter pls stop attacking me
And that's how you slain them, everyone.
No wonder Kiara likes you so much, this is f-wording FIRE 🔥❤🔥❤🔥
Booper
Based
Damn.
THIS SHITS A BANGER LETS GOOOO!!!!!
I fully agree with the message of this one. If you want success you better stop making excuses and start putting in the blood, sweat, and tears necessary to achieve your desires.
Fucking worth it
I like the Shinobi vibes
Im already breaking down the lyrics
SHE DOES NOT MISS.
--TBAVtubers disliked this--
I missed it by 15m bruhh
our rapping reaper never ceases to amaze us, does she?   i’m so proud of her though, this is such an amazing song and i’ll defo have this on repeat for days😭❤️
Me personally I'm not a fan of ain't my genre all things considered
This remind me about the the past more than the others
i need a fire extinguisher
Being a Simp Really is Worth it
Thanks for the though love Calli, this maybe will be a hymn in My life and it will bring motivation in everything i do, continue with your hard job but don't forget to take a rest everyday and i will don't stop on what i want to do
Well, you heard Dad, Deadbeats. Rise up and make her proud.
So this is her diss track. I like it
This message is for future reference, I want to one day get a collab.
How are you so fucking cool? YOU'RE SO FUCKING COOL, CALLIE!!!!!
It's so hard to choose which song is my favourite, so i'm gonna go ahead and say all of them.  Straight fire like always, Calli.
This is actually savage! Pure truth only hurts those that can’t accept it.
Yes. so much yes. this is CallioPog 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 the lyricism is so incredible. preach it
Wow! This certainly was a song, and you were not kidding about the tough love. And I most certainly LOVE this! Nice some roasting here, which no doubt everyone loved. Got some tan from this. ;) But in seriousness, again, this song was just awesome! Nothing much to say here, sorry. But still, had LOT of fun and I know I will be listening this if I need little extra motivation. Thank you Calli for this awesome beating music! You once again came in from your hiatus and for a short while took a GOOD swing with that scythe of yours! Thank you! My HoloMusic has gotten new awesome add into it's playlist!
*INSTANT LIKE* 😂
Ahh~ it's so good
I MISSED IT IM A FAILURE IM 12 MINUTES LATE DAMN I DONT DESERVE TO BE STEPPED ON
This is so fucking good.  Love it.
I love how versatile Calli is when it comes to her music! A banger as usual Calli!
Why is my sound system on fire?
​Did an all-nighter and was about to crash before school, this did more for me than caffeine ever could. Getting a reminder of how much effort is required to achieve is a blessing. Thanks <3
no sleep for me, gotta just have this on loop for 3 hours, this f*cking bops, you did an amazing job
Calli is the best, I literally can't stop listening!!!!!
Sick
This. Is. FIIIIREEEE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 SHOTS FIRED YALL  Good job Calli!!
I think I'm gonna play this on loop while working, thanks for everything Calli.
Incredibly based, tell em you scythe swingin' badass.
song is damn lit!! also those lyrics ayyyyy
かっこいい〜！！！ もう10万再生くらいあるの凄すぎる！
That hook is SO catchy. Good work 👍 this is gonna get stuck in my head
Words cannot describe how fire this is. This was amazing, and its never leaving my music playlist.         I'm probably gonna listen to this on repeat for the next 3 hours or so. :}
ok
This gives me fnaf vibes......     I love it.
Wow this was FIRE. This was real. Loved it.  The verse where she goes  "Easy for you to say, Little Miss Company Hire As if these moves did not take heartache And these tracks are not fire".  That did for me.
I’m so glad I waited for this, I sadly couldn’t be at the premiere, but this is amazing! I’ll definitely be listening to this 900+ times over.
Never expected anything less than straight fire from Calli. But guess what, this one burns hotter than hellfire.
Vtweeters slayed.
It's 11pm here, but the return of the Diss Queen is gonna keep my head swingin' until the sunrise.
Traditional instruments fit so well with her rap. The art is also incredible. Thank you for the 1 mil gift calli.
Wow, i was just listening to her old songs like right now. Had no idea she was about to release a new one.  The timing was superb.
Phenomenal. Thank you for this meal.
simply incredible, and whoever tells me otherwise is an asshole
Callie is just showing who the true Queen of the throne is
Welllllllllll...
Oh I'm swinging
YOOOO the visceral effect this had on my body was INSANE gg wp Calli keeping fning REAPING
Callie: "You want a balanced following? Then start creating, stop tweeting."   Indie Vtweeters: suprised pikachu face
My wig wasn't snatched... My whole head was tho...
RIPieces vtweeters.
Beautiful.
Another amazing track from the reaper rapper. I'll take all the extra motivation I can get lol
Ma dayyuum this slap harder then my dad’s belt
I am so proud to sy I was there when it premiered!!🌹
Deadbeats replaying now, deadbeats replaying now! This track is straight 🔥 and those lyrics... straight to the jugular. Calli ain't our *reaper* dad for no reason.
DAMNNNN
I missed this wowwww. So good!!!
Ooooooofff
I'm really out of words my fucking god calli you are sooo good.
Ok slow It slaps, but it's no banger hammer
Can't wait for people to get mad just because she told the truth
Dope
MY FACE MELTED BECAUSE THIS SONG IS SO HOOOOOOOOTTTTTT!!!!!!!!! I LOVE YOU CALLLLLLLLIIIIIIIIIII
I love everything about this song especially the title. Good work as always 👏
This track had all of the disses and I just love it. That call to action hits so hard and I love it.   "You can create! Push forward, commit, find your following!"  God, I want to try. It's like the last step of the Vtuber rabbit hole. You enjoy the talents and then you try to follow "their leading".
RAP GOD AND NO ONE CAN TAKE HER THRONE!!!!!!!!!
This song is a kick in the nuts...I love it!
THIS SONG IS AMAZING !!!!!!!!!! excellent work as always calli !!!!!!!!
RENT FREE
Shots fired, VTweeters down, haters slayed.  Fucking. Beautiful.
Listen to this at 10 and oh boy was the wait worth it HOOOOLY
No tengo ni la menor idea de que dice pero estoy agradecido de ver esto
This beat goes HARD!!!! すごい！！！
heads will roll～
w h a t  a  b a n g e r.
Love the aggressive energy Calli.
Soooo  good
I can't stop the loop...
This might be my new favorite of Calli's songs! She never disappoints!
This diss track is fire  But yes. Excellent message Calli. With you 100%
Anyone still here replaying it ?? 💀Deadbeats Swinging Now!
Lyrical God has blessed us again🙏🙏 I'm feeling fired up! I'm gonna listen to this whenever I feel lazy lol Oh and the SOUND. Wow the music is so good!
an absolute banger
Hey queen, you dropped your  crown 👑.   I am     s i m p i n g
"Start creating, stop tweeting", I love how she roasts all the salty v-tweeters with this song. It sounds harsh but its absolutely true.
Calli spilling the cold hard truth in her songs since debut, and we love it!
what a Start for the Week
Heads will roll, and I'm here for it.
Absolutely amazing Calli! I'm still relatively new around here, but your talent leaves me amazed!! In the words of a certain pirate, "Dope!!! Based!!! Super Lit!!!" And to all the Deadbeats here for premiere, it was a pleasure hyping with you all. You guys are the best!!!
Bruh this one went hard! Calli has never disappointed but I genuinely think she's reached a whole new level with this. GG Queen, gg
Am new to this channel and am fell in love with her and ur voice so much 🥰
What a banger song to listen to during my lunchbreak!
🔥🔥🔥  best one yet   🔥🔥🔥
Another Amazing Track! Hype for the Album grows each passing day! Keep it up!
Love your songs calli keep the great job!<3
the ones who disliked this are all the vtweeters that were completely destroyed by Mori just now
"Then start creating, stop tweeting"  APPLY COLD WATER TO THE BURNED AREA
"then start creating stop tweeting" ROASTED
Here before 100k
uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
humans
FLAMES!!!! I ain't been caught on fire by a track like this....since ya last song, lol.  Calli go hard, tell 'em what it is!
Beat, sick. Lyrics, sick. But the message behind the song, nastiest truth pill to swallow. Absolutely fucken' fantastic, Mori!
I got some vibes from the "old time", nice. 10/10
🌸🇯🇵日本人コメント掲示板 🇯🇵🌸
A truly amazing way for my day to end
STREAM THIS OFF W THEIR HEADS 1M VIEWS
I like how she called out the "vtubers" who just complain on twitter without actually working on being vtubers.
Is... Incredible
I love this. I find the lyrics incredibly motivating. I suppose I'll work 'til I'm bleeding if it means I don't have to be a slave or an entertainer. I don't want to be at the whim of another, so I suppose I'll swing until the sunrise.
Yeeeeeee buddy I love it!
5 am in the morning but perfect song to  wake me up and get ready to kill the day!
Posers and VTweeters BTFO. Top notch Mori Sama.
STAYED TO 5AM TO LISTEN TO THIS AND IT WAS WORTH IT i love your work and you are such a big inspiration !! i'm gonna replay ir many times to analyze the lyrics better
Damn, Calli didnt lie that this would be a "motivational" song.  It just slaps hard that it would make you want to fight and army. But this time, you're not alone, because all Deadbeats are joining in the fight with Calli being like the commander.  Really love the mix. Cant get enough of the drops and spins. Further empathizing that "crazy" battle feel. But still having that Japanese vibe.
The line in the middle where she hits back to the people saying she's only big because she joined hololive. OOF IT WAS GOOD. Slayed, showed how it really is. 🔥🔥🔥
NGL, THIS IS BANGER!
Well one word really summarizes what I feel from this song:  O e f
after this song I need to get money and become a member
This Song is an absolute Banger, well done Calli !!!  👏👏👏🌹
I can't even describe the overwhelming emotion I'm feeling right now and I haven't really stopped crying... But I do know that this song is INCREDIBLE!!
THIS IS SO GOOD
So lit my house is on fire. Amazing work, Calli.
damn
Mixer is AO? You mean THHK AO? Why i didn't check the credit sooner, dang! Great job to all of those who involved on this masterpiece!
This is so fire it puts the term “arson” out of business.
shots fired. stop tweeting start creating.
For me this came out at 1AM and here i am, no regrets
ON FIRE 🔥
Awesome as always dad.
THANK YOU TO EVERYONE INVOLVED IT WAS GOOD <3
Good song  Ms. Mori!! Great beats!! Yeaaaaaaaa!!!!!!
"Start Creating and stop TWEETING" pretty much 90% of so called Vtuber debutants "coming soon" in twitter.
Straight fire. I have no other words for how amazing this song is
MY HOUSE IS BURNING DOWN
that was fucking fantastic
"Ya want a balanced following? Then start creating, stop tweeting" Man, not only this is complete fire, but this also roasted a lot of those "debut tba" peeps lmfao. Gotta hand it to Calli for being awesome as f~
oh my god i love the design and the rap.....
I liked this song.
Mori, this song has all my favorite things in it. Love iiiiit.
3:05 i just noticed the phone toy music :D
Yoooo epic beats and words!  Great job calliope!!
Now I want to make a D&D character that's based off this song
a really catchy beat and a nice message about hard work and passion. you never disappoint calli!
Shout out to Orion Shea,  In the after premier chat, the last comment was theirs. It was simply, the word, "PEACE."
Banger
Calli!!!!!!! The heat was even too much for . The people disliking were the people that got sent to the emergency room for their third degree burns they received from your fire.
Ah mori calliope never fails me
OMG it is a Diss Track 🤣🤣 And hell it burns so hot 🔥🔥🔥 Good job Calli, totally amazing!!
GO OFF CALLI GO OFF
What a banger🔥🔥🔥
Bravo, wonderful, fantastic, bangin' beats. great work all involved
Oh my YAGOO this is the diss track version of a dempsey roll. Calli's tongue sharper than her scythe
So fire
This is so damn fire
I HAVE LITTERAL CHILLS  I know you worked really hard on this Calli your hard work is shown in your work and you deserve all the praise you get 💜💜💜 good job dad!!!
LITERALLY JUST AFK'ED A MATCH JUST TO WATCH THIS LIVE SONG AND ITS FUCKING LITTTT🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Damn Dad, you're the best roaster in town.

JEZZZ CALLI  AS ALWAYS THE BEAT IS GONNA BE 🔥🔥🔥🔥
*This was extremely, hair-raisingly LIT!*
💪💪
Guess the fuck what.....I can't begin to think much but feel it....lol
Okay yeah this one's evergreen for sure. Mix hits hard, rhymes hit harder, and the replay button might as well just be a loop button. Good job Calli!
bruh i am SO HAPPY i saw this during the premiere!!! the hype was SO STRONGGG
Congratulations, Calli, you did it again, my head is off with again, can't resist your vibes!

I think it was alright. Probably 8/10 song.
Best way to start the TAKAMORI week!, this is fire as usual <3
vtweeters got roasted so hard, I don't think there's any ashes left to rise from.
Thank you for blessing us Skrellingtons witth this Masterpiece. I really appreciate your music and all the time and effort you put into it. This song hits home. I'll keep aiming and moving towards greatness as well! Thank you again! ❤
HERMOSO, Calli supremacy
>Makes a song calling out all the "Vtubers" that tweet and moan while not making content.   The fallout is going to be DELICIOUS to watch.

Yup, still got it. And now I’m motivated Edit: Cannot get the hook out of my head aaaa
ABSOLUTE FIRE

Korone : Yubi-Yubi Callie : Kubi-Kubi
Only can say Oh My Gosh
"You want a balanced following? then start creating and stop tweeting " 💀💀💀💀 LOVE THAT
Was that Kiara in the background?
COPY LINK. DOWNLOAD. REPLAY 3 THINGS THAT SHOULD BE DONE
Gotta love the SakuGUH~
LETS GOOOOOOOOO
rip vtweeters :clap:
I get home from work. See this in my recommended. I am happy now.
Is that voice at 1:39 also Calli? Doesn't sound like her lol Anyways, this song was a banger! Liked the other ones, but now this one is my favorite lol
I’m so sad I missed the premier for this but super glad to say another song is added to the workout list!!!🤘🏽🤘🏽
This song was not what I expected, and I say that in a good way. I was promised tough love, but got maximum motivation instead, not disapointed at all
Great song, Calli! Keep the bangers coming!!!
This isn't the first time you've here...   And like same
Absolute banger.
man calli is holding no punches. She took some serious shots and i love it.  and that end, perfection. I love callis voice so much.
I was listening to this on me switch when the little nugget died on me.
💞💞💞
*Ngl, Mori looks hot.*
Let’s go!!! Another smash hit by our Mori! Really great job on this, Calli
Hot fucking damn ladies and gents.
The drop is so sick!!!! Fire track Calli!
A minute of silence for the replay button, this song was so on fire we all have already broken it.
- mad beats - deadly rap  - beauty wallpaper   Boi oh boi this is good
One big metaphor for Calli working hard while other just ramble on about doing things instead of actually doing anything.
Another epic track with a feel all it's own.   Truly the queen of rap!
That was god damn amazing.
Huge congrats Calli! Amazing song, and a great way to celebrate reaching 1 million subs! Here’s to many more to come! 💀❤️
For everyone who requested Calli on a dirty beat, time to pay up cuz she delivered. And hell yes did she delivered
🌹🌹🔥🔥💥🏴‍☠️
I missed the premiere by 3 minutes... this is so sad
Calliope's new song always makes me flutter
I'm gonna be having this song on loop for a long time, I absolutely love this take on tough love and it's a bop to boot!  Was already a Dead Beat from the beginning, proud to be inspired by you even if I was more shy about my feelings at first, but now this song burns the fire in my soul even brighter than it already was!  Please have fun with your trip with Kiara, you deserve all the rest you can get for doing so much for us already!
the melody is a bit too loud but I love the song, cheers.
喋ってるの英語なのに、むちゃくちゃ和の曲あいすぎでしょ……！ 本当にカリオペちゃん可愛い〜！！
Absolute Banger, thanks for another amazing song Calli!
今度のtrackはAOか！
it was worth staying up till 5am for this
Nice song Calli, your song is fire🔥
I wonder if her skill with rap is the source of her “GUH”. She can hold her breath for so long it get to a point where she gasps
i mean she literally lives in our heads rent free
Haters get called out. Nice!
A...WE...SOOOME
Dou
Reaper Kendo Club when?
nice
"Start creating, stop tweeting" Vtweeters on suicide watch  Edit: Thanks Watame Virus for the suggestion
TOPHAMHATKYO outdid themselves with this one. Love the song Calli!
🔥🔥🔥
Mori poppin' off here! Took their heads off to the ground even though they have none. Sick beats to beat them under six feet below, along their non-existent contents. Hopefully, this will fire them up to grind and create the real shits, instead of useless banter spits.
Alright I'm ready to off my head after hearing this masterpiece, rest well and PEACE!!!
Time well waited
amazing calli i'm always like that you're songs address the like 7 maybe 8 people who don't like you so the other million of us can laugh at them
YOUR BOY POPPED OFF HOLYYYY
Oh, Calli on cleaning job.  BOP!
My b0ss never disappoints me, I liked the style, specially certain line about stop tweeting and stuff, she's spitting as always. I wonder if I become so sing all of her songs my pronunciation in english will improve, you know? spanish is cool and all that but english is the meta so ... Anyways, banger song, Looking for find it in Spotify soon
Damn she's going full Eminem on this one
Is this gonna be in the next Rocky movie?
i've listened to this for 5 times times now
beat and vocals are peanut butter and jelly
Hello to the replay gangs o(*°▽°*)o
日本ぽい音楽と英語ってこんなに合うんですね...😭
2:03  Calli! Stop! Stop! They're already dead!
You kill it, you killed me, you killed everyone. You...you’re so so amazing I have literally no words for the experience I went through listening to this song just now. Thank you Calli! Forever and ever, for all of eternity!!!  Edit: we went from Masochist in the debut song to Sadistic 🤔 We love the duality lol
HOLY MORI.... THIS IS FIRE!!!
Well I found a new song to blast on repeat! Good work!
I love you CALLI!!!!!!!!
This was an absolute banger. Definitely a different vibe as calli said “tacky” but an amazing one. This is going on loop in my playlist 🌹👏        Alright, the more that I listen to this song, its just so good and the message is strong, again not only about the vtweeters and etc.. but like very encouraging in general for everyone, this was indeed the tough love that I needed to hear. thank you Calli/Dad
SIMPLY EPIC!

"You want a balanced following? Then start creating and stop tweeting"  Twitter status: *DEFEAT*
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The million skeletons following as satire line. 🔥🔥🔥
UwU kawaii ne~
Yes! That's what I'm freaking talking about! Nice to see you returning to your more aggressive style. This was exactly the kind of harsh, yet inspiring wake up call I, and I'm sure a lot of other people needed. It was like being set ablaze, but instead of breaking you down, it pumps you up and makes you want to soar. It's nice to see all of your hard work pay off, Calli. You've truly outdone yourself. Now, it's time for me to get off my ass and start swinging my sword around. Thank you.
Calli: Off With Their Heads! Everyone else: "Guess I'll die"
Heat. Straight heat.
"Then start creating, stop tweeting"  She just called out "V-tweeters", goddamn shots fired.
overall really enjoyed it!
This is giving me musunde hiraite rasetsu to mukuro vibes o.o
How does she only put out bangers. It shouldn't be possible. Alas, I'm glad it is because this song slaps
The closer it got to the premiere, the more clearly I could hear my heart beating in my ears. I never thought that I could feel and that I would ever feel something like this in my life. You slayed me
fire song, this is liit!!!!
IT GOT ME SO GOOD ! ! !
I choked on my cereal
Absolute banger.
this is sick
Honestly Callireally put alot of effort to prepare for this million subs celebration Original, the quality of the song itself is enough to convince you this is such a masterpiece.
This was an absolute banger, this is straight up fire  I liked the little jab (little jab? This was a full combo) at the "V-Tweeters"   I loved the beat, i loved the chorus although I'm gonna have to listen again to get it stuck in my head (ain't complaining)
首を刎ねる...
Calli never misses with her songs they’re all bangers‼️‼️
absolute fire
I really can't help but want to listen to her songs with how amazing she is at singing
Hell yes! That was golden!
The fire, The callout to Vtweeters, magic.

This was amazing!!!
Is amazing how Calli is improving with the pass of the time, I can't wait to see how good will be her future raps.
I absolutely loved it! I like that you have talent for different styles of music. It helps that you are one of the most skilled lyricists I have heard.
I'm not a fan of the songs that just has someone talking over music
Nice.
Thank you for putting in the time and effort to produce the amazing songs for us Calli!  Your singing voice is amazing!

Heads are temporary, but swinging the scythe is ETERNAL

Cheers to the millions plus views this will be getting
Wahhhh I'm so glad to be a deadbeat lol awesome work calli your music is the best
Calliope graces us with another song
just waiting for the nhato remix at this point
This is so beautiful Thank you Calli.   This song is really a big improvement on all your previous songs keep at Call we dead beats are here for you.
This is exactly the kind of message the generation that your fans are from need. Absolutely incredible - brutal words that cut deep but inspire the greatest sense of motivation one could ask for. I'm seriously in awe that you decided to not only make a song with this message, but also make it as ruthless as you did.
GOOOOOOOD I N S A N E! Loved it so much
"then start creating stop tweeting"   OH SHI-
Fue un placer, caballeros~!
I spent the past two hours listening to mellow, heart meltingly cute songs from the other Hololive members just so the whiplash fron this badass track would hit just right. It did not disappoint. Dead Beats, swingin' now.
im waiting till someone create a map with this song
God, I love that diss against the Vtweeters who are all talk and causing drama.
Expectation WELL EXCEEDED

Just like the lyrics says "THESE TRACK IS ON FIRE🔥"
Turn on the CC for a singalong lmao! Calli you did another amazing job!

The rap mixed with the traditional Japanese instruments makes for an amazing sound. Calli, this was absolute fire! You keep outdoing yourself each time you release a new song!
I'm trying hard not to cry from how this hurts. Thanks for the motivation Calli.
This song slaps tho
Absolute. Fucking. Fire.

just Wow
Vtweeters are going for some field trip with this  Edit: made a hecking song in two weeks to call out debut-TBA vtubers, Calli's a CHAD
First few minutes of February? Loved em
Bruv.... BRUV!!!! The beat was probably the hardest one she’s rapped too! It fits so good with the aggressive lyrics and my god this song slayed like crazy! I swear Calli’s music is an absolute treat and I bet if she was able to perform live on Stage even as her soon to be 3D model I’d buy my ticket the second they release!
Holy hell! Absolutely straight. Fucking. Fire! 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 What a call out dis to every "Twitter warrior" who won't do a fraction of Cali's work.
Loved your song Queen🌹
I can't believe Tophamhat is the producer (mix). I mean, it's not suprising he showed up, but I never knew he produced as AO.
I CAN'T STOP SCREAMING EVEN IF MY MOM'S ALREADY MAD AT ME ! THIS IS JUST SO GOOD. I'M CRYING. YOU'RE THE BEST CALLI!!!!!❤❤❤
2:04 she simply stated the truth.
You open your mouth, and pure magic comes out. It's no exaggeration calling you a musical genius. You are simply amazing Calli!
That was INSANE is it getting a little hot for anyone else?

AAAHHHH-  That was so fire!! The instrumental was incredible and the rap was too! Great job!!
The "Vtubers" who do nothing but post on Twitter will never recover. Well done Mori-sama.
Everything about the song is so good I can't believe it
Wow this was beautiful, thanks for your hard work.
Now Im not surprised that its a banger now, the damn mix is made by the same artist behind Mister Jew Box which is another banger of a song.  Thanks again for another song to add to the Hololive Rabbit Hole Playlist! 🔥🔥🔥
Yo this song slaps so fuckin hard.
The combination of Japanese-style music and powerful rap is wonderful!!!!!!!!! Also, the thumbnail calli is very beautiful.
STRAIGHT FUCKING FIREEE!!!!!!
Great song as always calli ! ♥️♥️
I heard welcome to the melon top
"start creating, stop tweeting" *OOF, MASSIVE BURN TO ALL THE VTWEETERS*  Calli, you didn't had to do 'em like that, they'll try to cancel you!!1!

Happy I woke up just to hear this masterpiece Now I can go back to sleep in peace
≡ it's been 1 year and this song has always been one of my favorites
you know, when her first tracks dropped, i thought they were only alright. this though? this is pretty damn dope. its great to see her improve her craft. at this rate she'll hit mainstream and be right up there with some big names
This is the song that will make you work your ass off. She calling out on us.
That traditional Japanese beat remix in the back 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Message received.  I’ll try harder.
Thanks Calli
This is indeed 🔥
SHOTS FIRED!! SHOTS FIRED!!
More of her demon is coming out. Love it!
This song is sick. A few months ago I attempted to start learning how to make music, but I never really pursued it. After hearing this I might pick it up again, BECAUSE THIS SONG SLAPS.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 speechless
Oh Calli the song is so amazing(*๓´╰╯`๓)♡
queen
Sounds like I heard a bit of a callout to all those yet-to-debut vtubers who talk trash all day on Twitter.   Great song Calli!!

Thank you Calli for all your hard work until now! The Song is AWESOME AND I LOVE IT! Millions of Roses for ya 🌹
Late congrats on 1 mil subs!
that was fucking fire i mean i dont know what i heard but it was so guddddddddddddddddddd
This lit the fire inside me.
Love the new song time to put it on loop as I work
Wow, love the use of traditional shamisen to give it the effect of old school japanese theaters performances, fucking brilliant!
That "heads" at the end tho.....
Replay botton: guess I'll die
She sounds so much like Demonsice in this song it's crazy. She even uses similar phrasing and similar accents on her words.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Another bop 👏👏
This was hot fire!!! Another success from our favorite reaper!! SasuGUH!
"Are you a slave? An entertainer 'till the fun dies?" Guess it's official, entertainment group it is.

和なところに英語ラップかますのすこ
ALRIGHT TIME TO START STREAMING! Kpop streaming trained me for this moment. LETS GO CALLI!!!
We are approaching Peak Fire 🔥! The kinda hellfire I know Calli can spit! Great energy with just a touch of venom! But, also refined. TL;DR: Sick Track
Let’s go well I was once on the mountain top but I would rather climb this one *Simp 100* Edit: there something me and this rap have in common the pain I learn to savor after looking at my 40 undone assignments and 13 projects.
2:04 "Ya want a balanced following? Then start creating, stop tweeting"  Alright that was one fucking savage call-out Sasuga Rapper Reaper
so DOPE!
2:04 so many people just got murdered
Damn I totally see the tough love in this song;;; I love it
This was so good
I LOVE THIS SOND🌸
FIRE
My face is already sore from how hard this song slaps
THAT WAS INSANEEEE
Kept waiting for the beat to drop. It honestly felt like she was trying to hit a particular mood with the song, and I think she just missed it.
Just playing this on loop
"Then start creating, and stop tweeting"  GOD DAMN HELLFIRE RIGHT HERE

Wow, that was amazing! This is your best work yet, you should be proud of it!
Every new song breaks the submit, raising the mountain top once again

SHE DOESNT MISS
Ah Im late!!!   I Love your rap Calli!!!
Oh hell yea! The premiere was so sick! Well worth the wait!
Damn. Calli went straight for the throat.
Dude, talk about motivational. Calli calling us out!
Time to blast this to all my neighborhood.  They gonna love it and if not well too bad for then they are not deadbeats. 99999/10
WOAH WOAH WOAH... Are we not gonna talk about the beat, keep up the good work Calli🔥❤️
i was sweating so much listening to this, it is literally fire
Damn, Calli wants all the smoke with these fake "VTubers". Not that she has to worry since at most they will just hate on her on twitter and that's it
dem shots FIRED
This is probably the most track she's released. Looking forward for more fire tracks like this in the future!
THIS IS MY FAVORITE SONG BY HER HOLY MOLY I AM BLOWN AWAY
swing emoji when? ó wò
If Calli was the main antagonist in Mulan (if there even is one)
Another banger! Calli always Deliver
i woke up for this at 5, normally i sleep until 12, i’m pretty tired but the song is fire, i don’t regret nothing
Here before an osu beatmap is made for this song :)
Mori you are really talented and I'm so happy I found your channel ♡
Calli has found her sound. This is fire, the beat is master crafted, the flow is nonstop and it is built around her voice, rather then calli trying to fit into the track. Album when?
And that's the kind of heat I've been waiting to see back in the saddle. Straight demon fire.
"What's your favorite genre?" "Calli"
Damn, this was a fucking banger.
I love this so much
That is really is something Hot💀☠🔥🔥
Thanks for such nice music! It really makes my day!
Congratulations on your new song Calli🎉🎊.  Critique: it's a bad beats compared to your previous songs.👌
Well the Pewter City Gym burned down, but I got to listen to an incredible song. I told the firefighters not to put it out, but they were already jamming too before I could finish the sentence.
This is fire 🔥🔥🔥
Really good rhyme schemes and her flow is pretty sick it's a weird beat but her flows rides it without a hiccup. Nicely done Calli
I really like the oriental aspect!
God damn the boi never misses. 🔥🔥🔥
This is so amazing
Track/mix AO. Hell yeah!
Golden vibe
Calli throwing shades to the haters
ALL I CAN SAY IS 👏. YOU NEVER FAIL US 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
This Song was Fire! Calliope Never Disappoints. She really is making a name for herself in the Music Industry.
I am ABSOLUTELY convinced this is the best one million subscriber special on this website, all your success is deserved and you worked hard to achieve it congrats again Mori  holy I'm still reveling from the last verse
I'm speechless, I don't know what to say.
Holy cow, that felt so quick yet **so good***!!!

Mori do you think you could put like a flash warning or something of the sorts in the title of like in the beginning of the vid. The flashing appears a lot and I think it can be harmful for some. I may not have epilepsy myself but watching some scenes genuinely hurt my eyes.

POG
HYPE
I'm here today for a beautiful moment in history as there's on min left to the start of this beautiful song reveal
1 Minute till premiere pog. Soooo How was your day? OK, just done with the video this is actual fire, Thanks Mori!!!
I am the first comment when this was live
(:
Pog
ahhhhhhh
Calli has never disappointed once, whether it be music or anything else. I'm sure this is gonna be amazing
I woke up in the middle of the night for this...
Bruh
5am and i am here for it <3
LETS GOOO
This inspired me to do my modules.
That feeling when you have 60 seconds to it airs:
It's Gonna be FIRE Edit: ITS FIREEE
4 am yet I’m still here
I am already moved by the description
Will this be coming out on Apple Music??
11 PM GANG
This is a f-wording banger!

Calli: off with their heads Kiara: I'll give you he-
Welp I’m a fan of trivium this has the same energy as “I’ll take their fucking heads” lmao
IM SO EXCITED

I like her songs. she's a born rapper.
I leave my comment here as history for when this blows up just to say I called it *DEADBEATS FOREVER*

This grim reaper deserves every achievement she has right now. Best tsundere so far owo
"This is a Motivation Song"  Bury the Light : Finally, a worthy Opponent. *Our Battle will be Legendary*
Like this if Calli has a good voice
I was here
Calliope: *stares directly at me*  Me: Why do I hear boss music?
poggers
Just finished a game jam and I'm braindead af, but I'll be damned if I miss this
Kitsune Calliope making me act up ngl.

Yosh original song  Love her voice
I'm gonna lose my head after listening to this one
A new song so soon?  Well, let'er RIP!  (Loved the song!)
!
HI JAN
46 minutes till premiere!
Oh boy oh boy oh boy, I cannot wait for this song to absolutely make my ears cry from happiness.
I await 👁👄👁
This song is sick
Before Listening: This song was beautiful and made me feel things
GUH
Also, I want to say this. I just finished Demon Slayer, and that mask the Mori is holding looks very framiliar.
If you see this FBI ur a trooper man. In pre-chat for 12 hours straight waiting for this banger
I am in aww with this artwork. Like I said in the comments of her slither io stream earlier today, I need an 8 foot by 5 foot poster of this.
Won’t be able to be here when it drops. See you in the morning fellow deadbeats
"Off With Their Heads" lol the amount of edge is killing me quicker than any type of cancer
Liking the video before the live starts
Last thing Deadbeats hear before dying
the art looks like a yabai oneesama shinigami and i love it dem vtweeters are gonna salt hard and i'm all in for this, give them the tough love Calli!
I have to tune in this time. Very excited!
I went to sleep and woke up and it still hasn’t premiered yet
Which head tho?
Damn those beats makes me goosebumps
`
Can’t watch it straight away due to class RIP
Haven't listened to it yet but the fact it's a motivational songs already makes it a 10/10 again for me🏄‍♀️👌👌👌  Yo that was so good god I'm gonna pass away
Well, here i am waiting till 1 am.
I have to be up at 5 am and this premiers at 11 pm. I’ll be fine
It’s about time I added more songs huh.
I'm rolling my head for this
not gonna lie im interested to see this song
Everything I've done has lead me to this moment, I no longer have any regrets in my life knowing I'm right here, right now. Proof I was here for premiere WOOOO!!!!!!!!!
この人の「首をはねる」は冗談にならないw
Online class is temporary, shinigami is eternal.  Skipping one class for Calli won't hurt.
Damnnn firee
OH YEAH JUST AN HOUR AND A BIT AND WILL BE COOKIN
The fact that calli is about to motivate me is motivating me
I would like everyone to have to read 177013 please.
I already know this is going to be amazing
Why me think of skyrim when i saw "Off With Their Heads"
before listening to this motivational song: LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOO
damn the artwork got me sick.
Who made this art ? Give me the name plz
Why is time so slow. I wanna hear it now. 🥺
im ready to be slain
Pog
Pov:you stayed up late for this🥴
I will type this to show proof I was here before it premiered
I didn't know i needed Calli in Kimono in my life
I already know this is gonna be amazing you never disappoint
This blew my head off.
This message in the description. Seems like there is a little bit of *****dice tendencies.
You know its going to be good with an edgy title like this
Calli: I am a reaper but im a full time streamer now. Deadbeats: **grabs scythe** Fine, I'll do it myself
So, this song is for the likes of me.. That's neat...
​SCP-953 Kitsune
POG
IM SO HYPED
Yesss! Finally a song premiere that I won’t miss!    All of the song premieres that i’ve seen so far from Vtubers are at lest at 6 am for me and that’s a little too early for me lol
I'm ready
I want this so baddd  Hellva boss epi3 and mori song in one night ? YES
"Please don't hate your boy for giving you all a bit of tough love..."   Don't worry, I'm alive today because people I love were there to rip me a new one. I wish I could say I'm sorry I didn't get to meet you sooner but honestly, I might be better off here.
Always cheering for you
The songs not even out yet and im so hyped
Damn this cover art is fire
Excited
I can already tell this song is gonna be fire just because it's a song from calli
that song description makes me want to make a bad decision and stay up late enough to hear it. I can survive on 4.5 hrs of sleep... right guys?
I already know this song is gonna amazing I heard it’s going to be a very motivational song and I don’t know why I might cry love u Calli
The anticipation is killing me
*Calli hasn't even started singing and it's already sounding beautiful*
Calli’s voice is so amazing I can’t wait to hear this.❤️❤️  I loved it, it was so good luv you Calli.
Calli in the thumbnail looks like one of the demons in demon slayer
公開3時間前なのに1.2万高評価で5千人待機してるのスゲーな、これが世界か
How does this already have dislikes? It's Calli we're talking about here, and she ain't let us down yet!
Pls step on me calli
I heard this song is gonna be a bop with the french
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Cover art got me feeling emotions i didnt even  know existed-
Calli with kimono 2d model when?
Lmao
deadbeats .
I believe in Calli’s supremacy
looking hot in the thumbnail ay
Music truly hits different after hearing Calli.
"Please don't hate Your Boy for giving you all a bit of tough love..."  If anything that's what most (and especially young) people need more of. No reason to hate anyone for it. Also feel like I would be a massive hypocrite if I disagreed.
That description... she's literally called us masochists basically already lmaooo
Calli: "Make content" Vtweeter: "wtf did you just say to me?!" Calli: "Oh, I'm so sorry! What I said was..." *Beat starts playing*
Heh... Specal day song
maybe i am crazy but Calli's outfit looks like Miyamoto Musashi in FGO
ain't no motivation is gonna help me XD - I have so many things I _must_ do, so many I _want_ to do.... - but above all, I have major depressive disorder; barely capable of the minimum to survive....
gonna repeat this whole day
Before listening: I am afraid the amount of bass WILL destroy my headphones.  After listening: Awwwweeessssoooommmmeeee, but 'scuse me, I have to call the fire department.
緊張過ぎる、 (´｡• ω •｡`)
Another bop to add to the playlist 🎲
Time to party and paint them red guys!!!!     If you get my reference I love you❤
Hype HYPE
This artwork is STUNNING.
Poggers :O
Claim your "Here before premiere" ticket after it runs out                   ne legit this song prob be a banger like the other ones
It's going to premiere at 3am bruh 😔
The thumbnail looks pretty ❤
IM HYPE AF
FIRE!! 🔥🔥🔥
This thumbnail 's giving me demon slayer vibes!
Been with the deadbeats since her debut but still too broke to get membership💀, atleast this one blessed my soul
Oh ghod the art!!!!!!😍
I can assure you...this is going in my playlist for running
Before premiere: I have a plan, this begins at 4 am so basically, I’m leaving my sleep mask headphones thing at max volume and when the premiere begins I’ll wake up and vibe.
"Off With Their Heads" Gramp Hassan would be so proud of her
Know we play the waiting game..
Thumbnail would be a great new year dress.
I go to bed at this time man
Unfortunately I'll be sleeping when it premiers, but our reaper never disappointed us when it comes to singing so one of the first things I'm going to do after waking up is listen to this upcoming masterpiece.
Hey the French people thought the same thing
Before watching:  I'm sure this is gonna be fire, Calli is very talented at singing.  After watching: I was not wrong.
Waiting for premiere. So excited.
Yagoo's hope and dream is not dead yet
planned at 5am -_- u really think am up that late?.. aight see yall then.
five minutes ago I wrote this exact sentence to someone, and now it already got turned into a song :v
Cant wait
literally the best birthday gift ever.
Ooo
Oooo edgy
*M O T I V A T I O N*
Cant wait. Also for some reason I want to see Calli being drawn in Wada Arco style.
Few more hours to go.. pumped as always!!
Suffice to say, heads will roll. Because down with the bloody big head!
Me reading the description: Is this gonna be a diss track on us to make us motivated? Oh? I like how she did the captions.
Goddess of Death
H Y P E
A BOP IS COMING, EVERYBODY STAY CALM, EVERYBODY STAY CALM
Mori, you should really push for this to be your next outfit, it looks freaking awesome. Especially if you can see the shoulder tattoo peek out from the dress.
Kitsune mask? I'm in!
I can see someone make a sick animation with her song ngl.
leaving my footprint before this absolute bop drops
Now I'm M O T I V A D E D    Edit: The song was way more motivated that I could ever been
In 6 hours!?!!
Before Listening I can already feel the hot bars radiation from this song
Which head we talkin bout here?
4am uk time. :(
This song premiers at 4AM. Can't do it any earlier?
God I'm so hyped.  Having heard previews, you're not ready for this song.
6am premier huh   Time to pull an all nighter i guess
I'm always ready for dad's tough love
6hrs before the premiere: Wow. The aesthetic of this thumbnail tho.  After listening to the song: I did not expect this beat but it works.
This one is added to my expanding cosplan. Love how she looks so pretty 😍
That mask gives of demon slayer vibes
I scrolled past this thinking it was a Megurine Luka song
This title is made for those 10 people that dislikes before the song has even been premiered
1. Calli sings like a goddess  2. This title and thumbnail makes it look like it will be awesome
Oh nice. She becomes Red Queen.
Calli: Off with their heads Me: *Guess I'll die then*
Cmon, it's gonna be 1:00AM here when the song premieres, wish it would air earlier
This comes out at noon for me
This premieres at 5 am for me        HAHA "SLEEP" ? YOU FOOLISH MORTAL!
聞いてないけど絶対かっこいいよ
Wait this isn’t Untoasted Bread It’ll be fire nonetheless
YYYYYEESSSSSSSSS
​TOPHAMHATKYO lets go!!!
7 hours before the premier and there's is 396 comment. What a madlad.
Pretty, cute
FUCKING H Y P E🥵👌
The hypeeeee 🖤🖤
Calli: off with their heads Kiara: YOU CAN TAKE MY HEAD ANYTIME CALLI!
I bet my soul that this song will have a rap on it...
I don’t even need to listen to know this is gonna be straight 🔥
Ohhh yeah, Starting at 6:00 a.m. sChOoL cAn wAiT
An epic song
this thumbnail reminds me of zero two so much
This about to be crazy
I'm apologizing in advance to the replay button
This is what i need
Nice, it's a great coincidence that Calli's new song is released today xD, definitely today is a perfect birthday xd
LET'S FUCKING GOOOOO
Cali’s song with Japanese theme?
Commenting before premiere because calli has yet to disappoint. *reads description*, huh why does AO sound familiar? *clicks link* OOOOOOOOOOOH MY GOOOOOOOOD  aw yeah that was the beat
I’m looking forward to the deadbeat disstrack.
Another great song to add to my playlist. 🧐 *Edit- Repeat button is broken*
Gotta press like first then I'm gonna sleep for a while. Wake me up when it starts.  Edit: you guys didn't wake me up😕
If this isn't playing in my funeral, I'm not going.
If I am right then the mask in thumbnail is either the kakashi Anbu mask or demon slayer curse protection mask.
Calliope never disappoints with her music.
You will probably get completely random, underserved hate on this video. Use this comment as a free coupon to delete 1 such comment from your consciousness :P  Edit: Nevermind, after hearing the song it's clear you already have that covered. Very inspirational song.
Well im gonna wake up with this song, a perfect shot of motivation before work!
Soon boys its been a min since the last calliope ear blessing
Only Calliope (both the goddess and Calli) can casually name a song "Off With Their Heads" and have it become a hit before it's even released...
Haven't heard it yet but I have complete faith this is gonna be a banger. Your boy does NOT MISS
Dance till you're dead
Waiting for that time i can hear Calli sing ❤ Her songs do CRITICAL damage.
I wanna listen already
Love the description but I gotta say it...  If you're mad over this song, it's because you probably needed to hear it. She's just trying to push you in the right direction by fueling that fire to be better than you are right now.
Tough love? Sasuga our dad
Another song to add to my playlist
We gonna get hyped
Calli is just built different
5 am for me but I will give up some sleep to hear your beautiful voice!
i already know its gonna be a banger
We finally got Calli to verbally abuse us in a non joking way
Shame it’s live at 4am for me but Calli hasn’t let me down with her music before and I doubt this will be an exception!  Keep up the good work Calli. Us Deadbeats will continue to support you all the way.
This is gonna slap I already know it
That artwork looks beautiful
Why must time move so slow? I've been waiting here for an hour knowing it goes live 8 hours from now. I just can't wait for this banger of a song to release. Calli, you rock!  Edit: it was more than a banger... Holy f*ck...
Some people are really I guess can see the future that they dislike before seeing the video ( it's not even started)
我等     ps.有沒有看了懂中文的也在等
Ya tiene mi like owo
Take me to the promiseland Calli ...🙈
YUS
Calli with kimono... ah yes..
Aaa
I'm hype for this lol Calli's music helps make work bearable all day
This will be awesome! I’m so excited!!!
THE ART IS SO AMAZING I LOVE IT

Yoooo this is Will gonna give you life
Calli: This is a motivational song Also Calli: Murder is motivating After video posted edit: She murdered them.
Only 8 more hours
Who's uploading to soundcloud first 5mins, pls leave link to ur profile or tee song here thx:
You know I’ve been playing too much FFXIV when my first thought is that Calli looks like Yotsuyu in that kimono.
This should be amazing as usual~  [Edit] Aaaaaaaaaand i was right~
This song she goes super sayian!!!
I can already see this hitting a million views in a day
i was here when this happened
断言するけど、絶対神曲
pog pog pog
I’m excited 🤗
Hi
"Please don't hate Your Boy for giving you all a bit of tough love..."  When we literally ask to get cursed at and stepped on, I don't know how she'd ever get the idea we wouldn't love this just for existing.
That artwork is just like demon slayer and I love it!
My bones are ready for some tough-love spit roasting
That's why when Riddle is off with your head
学校あるからプレミア公開で見れないよー😭
This is giving off big King Hassan vibes... Love it already!
New song👏👏👏
Wooo dead beats are coming from the underground again
For me is in the night ahhhh i cant wait
Just woke up can't wait

Kirisute Gomen
Leggo
Finally, an official soundtrack for our training arc!
Can't wait!
This song was just amazing! ( I'm pretty sure I won't have to edit this comment after the premiere)
The anticipation is killing me. Can't wait for another banger
Who the hell are the idiots that disliked the song 9 hours before it came out?
"You know you've made it when your selfies get more views than your music" - A Karen ;)
Mori, how about to taking part in Eurovision? I think you can realy win! 💪💪💪
Just a comment to promote Mori's video on threads =)
It's 2:20 AM lol. Gonna sleep and come back.
Ya know this art gives me persona vibes.  Persona 3 when?
Seeing Calli with a tattoo is doing things to me... Can't wait for some tough love from dad!! EDIT: HOLYS SH*T I'VE BEEN BURNT TO A CRISP
5 am for me, damn it
5am. Just like Cursed Night. This'll be the hypest all-nighter of the month.
The song isn't out yet but I can't wait until I'm bopping to it at 4am
Lesss goooo
Can't wait
On the thumbnail, doesn't はねる mean "bounce"?   Edit: wrong はねる oops 刎ねる is decapitate 跳ねる is bounce
well it seams like  im staying up until 5am again
It doesn't matter if the premier is at 5 am here, I'll be here listening, I can't wait.
aaaaaaaaaaaaa
I've been a big fan ever since you opened up your lemonade stand, you've gotten me through some tough times. Thanks for everything and keep it up!
The art is insane
Nothing beats getting hyped by the queen of go-getters herself.
POGGERS moment right here

HYPEEEE!
I will mark my place!! Let's goo deadbeats

Ollie needs to replace that sword in her head with a scythe
Why are there 700 people waiting, waiting 12 hours.
Hypeeeeee !!
I anticipate alot of the headbanging.  And now after listening to it. My head is now indeed rolling on the floor from all said headbanging I'll be listening to this one ALOT.
Well, I guess I’m getting up at 5am tomorrow...
Just to set a reminder . Wanna be here when it premiers . Looking forward to losing my head ^^
You know I was actually guessing the song title thingy. I was like it’s going to be “off with you” and surprisingly, I got half of it.. I’m proud of myself.
I was promised bread D: (This is a joke this song slaps but fr though any status on the bread rap?)
The thumbnail and the title gives me Demon Slayer vibes, is it wanted?
I come from the future and now I’m gonna tell you that this clip havs viewers more than 2,000,000
that is some high profile mastering engineer there
A song from Calli is for sure going to be fire, the preview already has me hyped. Also that artwork would be amazing on a wall scroll.
Half expecting this to be a Ghoul cover lmao
I'm so HYPED for this song!!
this song already looks fire maybe it'll start a fire wait what am i saying  it was fire
Here before dislikes start to randomly appear. Just like some gay vampire said "I've seen enough. I'm satisfied" this shxt gonna be lit
Calli in kimono and new song. My day can't go better then this
I have a feeling that listening to this will turn my headphones into phones  Edit:      So I have these phones
I'm from the future and I wanna say I like it!
Can’t wait to hear this, the time won’t come up fast enough
OH BOI This is gonna be another hit
*EXCITEMENT*
Whooooo baby~! I know this song is gonna be a banger! LET'S GOOOOO~!
I wanna be killed by another one of your songs. I love this japanese style illustration for the background. I'm 100% sure the song will live up to the hype. Love you, Calli, and congrats again for the 1 MILLION Deadbeats!!  IT WAS ABSOLUTELY A BANGER. TIME TO LOOP this Reaper non-stop.
たのしみ🥰
It's coming up in the morning for me. Can't wait to heat up my breakfast with these 🔥🔥🔥  Edit : My food got burnt. This is too much 🔥🔥🔥
Imagine Calli dancing in watanagashi festival wearing Kimono in Higurashi.
The art is really great. Waiting for the  premiere.
Yes, I would be happy to be beheaded by Cali.
I need Calli in a kimono tattooed on my back
Heads will roll... but we dunno which head.
BANGER INCOMING!🔥🔥🔥
(〃∀〃)ゞ
I'd be honor to be the first one.
Already know it’s gonna be so 🔥🔥🔥by art
LET'S GOOOOO 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
不愧是歌手 原創曲一首接一首
Art is 🔥🔥 and so will be the song as well!! Can’t wait for it come out and add it to my playlist!!! This song is something we all need in our lives to help us when we’re stuck in a rut or feeling a lack of confidence or even motivation. It tells us that we should keep fighting and working towards our goals and aspirations that we’ve set for ourselves. We haven’t lived yet until we’ve exhausted all our energy into it. Vtweeters that complain and nitpick each verse of Calli’s song are upset because they lack to see the bigger picture and are trying to discredit her, but are trying to avoid their own problems and look to make Calli look bad. She made this song because she put in the effort and has worked multiple jobs to be where she is and deserves every bit of it.  TLDR: Calli’s song is inspiring and she just wants to see others succeed in what they do, but if others aren’t willing to put in the work, they’ll be history and another memory that people will forget. Thanks for the amazing and beautiful song Calli!! Hope to hear more like this in the future!!
Damnnn that art looks great
楽しみ〜
So much hype it hurts
Very Poggers
Calli: “The song might be umm...tough and aggressive”  **Happy Masochist Noises**  Edit: This song hits harder than my moms slippers!🔥          It was lit Calli! I got goosebumps!👌🔥
Cant wait <3
めちゃくちゃ楽しみ！授業中にこっそり聞きます😼
This is gonna be so cool
Zoo Wee Moma

Most of Hololive: You are KING Calli: I am queen
I have a feeling dad will come in with another banger
I'm excited!

I'm sorry, I'm way too hyped.
行くぞおおおお
