Pov: Why do you like lemon so much?
❤ I love it turn yourself around for today Stingray Paw Patrol pretty
FYI mid engine simply means the engine is mounted in the middle of both axles. You can have a front mounted mid engine car.
Poor man's Ferrari
Still.......is a piece of trash!!
Most awesome sports car made. Love our C8😊
I NEED THIS IN MY LIFE!!!
Cool! My name's Chevy too!
Which Corvette camera is best Corvette camera?
Anjiiing🔥
I like the C7s
The c8 is everything the 2nd gen Acura NSX should have been
Bro is Chevrolet not chevy
Man this thing has to cost at least $400 million
If only I wasn’t broke
🔥🔥🔥WATCH MY SHORTS!!!
I built that!!
AMINE
Finally a good looking sports car
Never talks about performance
Man I love this car so much! Hopefully I can have it one day
I saw that car going home from a doctors appointment but it was red
Trunk and frunk… we call it ⏃ boot… we get ⏃ boot and ⏃ foot
This fucker go to the dealership test drives the cars & truck so he can do videos of how awesome they are. So YouTube can  pay him.
I would rather have a Tesla
Is my dream :)
That's a corvette C8.R
YO THATS DOPE
I’m thinking about getting a C8 and sting ray in the future
Dude, did you crawl out from under a rock? Those items you cite are already international.
I like this keep the facts up

Try recording with your cell phone held horizontally.  This is a car review, not a ghetto fight.
Sheverlay cervet
Aren’t all backup cameras above the license plate?
An expensive car that uses a 30 dollar back up camera. Nice 👍
Sounds like a lot of stuff that is expensive to fix when it breaks and btw c8s are gay
my dads venza does all this
Well the trunk still can't fit a pizza box though
You ruined it with the paint job
But it still looks like the Lamborghini you get off wish
This hurts
Thats really cool but here I am having to install my own backup camera in my 350z
Is it the c8
I think this is their first time seeing an actual car.
Noice✨
I will take one
I'd love to have this given to me. So I could immediately sell it. God that's ugly. I just can't appreciate new style lol. Why does YouTube show me this you ask? Who fucking knows.
I don’t care what anyone says, that isn’t a trunk. That’s a snack drawer in a car 😂
Europeans have been doing this since  2006 lmaoo nothing surprising
Naah 65' corvette better
It’s like amercia finally made a supercar that Europe has been making for the last 50 years
Hot 🔥 car https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn1VX39YCBs&feature=share
Trunk? You mean the 1x1cm scary space?
My next car 🚗
Damn that’s dope, I’m gonna buy a Tacoma now
sounds like a spy car to me 😂
It's a shit car give me a gtr all day long
So what's the stuff that just makes sense?
These gimmicks are freakin retarded, you know what would’ve made sense? Putting a manual transmission in a performance sport car
Bruh this is what sideswipe could have been if he wasn’t killed off and transformers still made movies
These mirrors are pure magic to me
This is the best drivers car for under a million... Beyond that it's not even fair to compare.
My dream car
Too easy
Imagine what the corvette c8 Z06 would look like
Too easy
Mechanics everywhere: this is a nightmare, kill me
It raises so it won't hit bumps Clicks button: car rises 2mm
I'll take my tesla thanks
Because this car is a chevy, it has an engine  Mind blown
In what world is it hard to see out of your rear view
This is my favorite car
Ahhh, yes I love cars that have a record for the computer crapping out otw from the dealership
Subara put a camera for the mirror
lol
The C8 corvette is in my opinion a really nice looking car
That’s literally half a trunk in total
Fun fact. GM calls for the vehicle to be chained to the hoist when changing the transmission.
Nothing new or special
Looks like 2007
That’s one slick dumpster.
It's hard to be impressed by the camera shit on this since my parents RAV4 has everything this had and a 360° top down view.
I want it.
Car dealer be like - why he is taking so long for the test drive ?  😂😂😂
I would prefer PRIDE over this car
Man I wish I had $100k
“A high performance screen to record your lap times” my 2002 540i was ahead of it’s time it has a lap time stop watch, and speed recorder in the radio, and dash of the car. Crazy
Well done GM. Cars like the Chevrolet Corvette remind me that there is still some good in American automotive engineering and that the bean counters can’t ruin everything produced domestically.
It's a budget lambo which is very cool
There’s a best car ever
Chevy messed up on this one. Why would you make a corvette look like a foreign 🤦🏻‍♂️ C7 was dope but the C8 just ain’t it bruh
not that color.
Those are actually feature that a lot of other sports cars have, the diference is the Corvette C8 asks half the price compared to others
The style of the C8 already had me sold, so no explanation needed
مافية سيارة أسبورت  تقارن  بفخامة الكورفت 🇺🇸👍🏻😍
But that’s a c8
Only thing that doesn't work       No stick
Walmart brand lambo
Bro you basically have pretty installed bags
In order to fix all of the problems noted in this video with the 2021 Corvette, I drive a pickup truck.
This guy has the same voice and accent as alpha male
There's something deeply unsettling about the RGB of this car's paint, and i can't place my finger on it
Literal forza mirror..
If the engine is in the middle...where do i go
I saw one of these today lol
I hate your voice
How much for it?
My favourite car
I thought the stingray was the last model corvette  well the first of the 7th generation corvette , is this a stingray or a just a C8
My gpa got a convertable one
Dope!!!! 🤯🤯🤯
Is it your cars
I hate these "things that just make sense" videos. Half of the features aren't unique, new, or interesting.
I heard this a secret flying mode did you check that out?.
I love this ride!!!!!!
That’s not a trunk 🤣🤣🤣 That’s only big enough for spare coins ffs ..
bro it’s literally from gta
I honestly really don't like the way the new stingray looks, the back is ugly and the front looks more like a ferrari than a corvette
*rips everything from European super cars from the last 20 years*
O 💩
That’s only the 2lt tho. 1lt doesnt havent any of that but the trunk lmao.
Ok
Holy shit things that should be on every sports car like this! Omg thank u so much!!!
Good luck with the oil change on this one🏳
Skrrrrrrrrrr Corvette Corvette
You legit just point out the obvious and get views off it like fking useless
Meanwhile i just drive my dad's good ol' 2007 Opel Astra H Van that once overheated and actually sounds like a muscle car now :P
How much dose cost
Did my guy seriously say Chevrolet Corvette OMG
Why i see test drive in license plate
I Love This Colour ❤️😘👍
Ferrari?
Hey bud, my dad is a worker at the dealership you tested this from, if you do not return it within the next 14 days we will have to get the police involved. This is not a joke.
At this point I kinda think you just bragging
This is one of my favorite cars ever
Chevy is finally making cars worth buying. Only a few decades late.
When you can't afford a Lamborghini you buy this.
Bad thing about them: they're sensitive to crashes and expensive to mend.
Funny how they tell people not to text and rive, yet they add more and more gadgets to cars all the time as well as a screen.
to bad u can’t use the back trunk when u take out the top part of the car :/
How much is this car because I would really like one :)
These videos are very informative. Could you start adding the, general, price for these cars? Thanks
this dude was hype over the extra trunk instead of the extra horsepower it can push with the engine in the middle
Is it electric
Alternate title: Flexing my car to teenagers on the internet
Well,he sure wasn't lying with the 'makes sense' thing. *engine in the midle means space in the front* even a toddler gets that
How much is this car so I can buy it in the future?
Carro hunday, imita carros como ferrari?🤣🤣🤣
I'm not used to upper class and this made me want to stay away from it
He just showed the car license plate-
If you don't instantly shit your pants and puke when calling these abominations stingrays, then you're fucked
Damn that’s a se y car
Bruh this trend is a new way to show off cars
we can all see your license plate
Alternate title: guy flexing his car for 60 seconds.
look like corvette as styled by Lamborghini studio. still nice tho' 👍
So cool
Nothing Chevy does makes sense
In the words of a great man " this car makes you 75% more attractive to your sister "
It looks like a rip off Ferrari. Kinda like the ripoff Bentley thats actually a Chrysler
Imagine. being such a shit driver to need those cameras and lift
You showed your license
I feel this video better than the tesla ones because he doesn't say MY Corvette...
A Trunk in the front and back, now I can look cool on the streets while transporting children from my friend's basement to mine
Is it manual?
Jeopardy  Answer: Gadgets that will break on the Corvette and be expensive as hell to fix  I'm allowed to disparage Corvettes because I own one and know all the annoying little bull crap things that break on them.
Wow to trunks that u can barely use when you faster better quality an store more this an people in a hellcat
Damn thats awesome
Dumb question: does that have a drift meter leaderboards?
Adding things European cars have had since 40  years ago. Congratulations Chevrolet, you did a thing,
Only good car Chevy builds anymore
Can this turn in bumblebee ?
The real question is : Does the price make sense?
Shame Chevy has such low standards of build that it will fall apart in a few years.
Rare instance of great American automotive design, value, and good engineering. Something the UAW has destroyed within the US..
Those it make it better then Tesla?
For 60k I’d hope it makes sense
Nice now I know somthing about a car that I'll never get
Ah, it's good to watch things that I won't be able to afford
Robber boss: Alright take notes everyone!
Wow! Things about a Car that JUST MAKE SENSE!
This is more effective than any car advert ever, hire this fkin guy
Oh a trunk in the back and the front?? Too bad both of them combined are half the size of the trunk in my daily driver.
Man making a whole commercial to get people to buy it like everyone is rich
Lmao instead of using the rear camera, why couldn't they just make a bigger rear mirror?
I know he's flexing secretly, but i gotta admit, this car is really cool looking
Old Ferrari Spider???
What do you do for a living?
You should just make a video saying top 10 reasons why Chevy is better than Ford
Is just me or does the rear of the car look angry?
The fact that everything is just buttons makes me dislike this car
This is my new favorite Corvette
It has the same screen infotainment sistem of the opel insignia lol
Hmmm I'm thinking it does make sense..
Frounck
Now I have to decide between this and the gtr.
Nice. However, I would rather buy a Ford GT which cost almost 10 times more.
You mean, slow ICE car ~
One thing i love about cars is the heights on the suspension so you don't get hit by the bump when ever you like low car
I must buy this car by God grace   The day I'll start my music career I pray I will make it well 🙏
I change my mind i like this more than a lambo I need the Corvette bc I love to feature and the look
I just bought one with a factory installed state of the art penis pump.
These Snozzberries taste like Snozzberries!
How much does this car cost at most?
Ok now someone buy this for me and I’ll give you a cookie
All those components should last about a year.
So it’s like majority of new cars?
it looks dark yellow
Things that just makes sense: 3021 car
Budget doug demouro
They really said need for speed
Wish Cadillac would’ve made a super car off this chassis 😔
Next, a car where you drive it lying on the car floor like batman. Very "fun"
I saw two of those corvetes. They look like transfomers, but they are so fucking low, every car at the road will block their view. It's a really shitty car to drive outside the racing track
Thx is fucking sick
If the engine is in the middle and you need to fix it how would you get to the engine🤔
That's a nice Ferrari     Sarcasm
So it has airbags ish
Anyone else see the front bumper cam and have no idea what it's showing in this video? Literally can't tell what the hell that camera is showing at all. Also, those 2 intro shots the camera adjusting back to the car isn't really a good look. Maybe make the shot slower and then speed it up in edit?
That ass
“Things that have been on cars for years but Americans only just discovered them”
That’s the gap camera
This is why I want a Corvette
"you can lift the front"    Ah yes, the totally new feature that's been there since the 90's
You know what doesn’t make sense the price
Shame it’s a corvette so you know it’s not going to function properly
Thanks now my car robbing game will get me a safe steal and way more money
https://youtu.be/CP-DEuIt_V8    For the skyline people n corvette people the skyline is lighter and smaller so even if you build the c8 and build the skyline the skyline will still murder the c8
Can it catch someone stealing it
Features, features, features. Shut up, and turn that beautiful Corvette on, I don’t like cars and mechanics to hear you blab on about features, rev that mf
“Because the engine is in the middle, it’s not in the front.”  Yes, the floor is made of floor.
It’s a beauty
Very cool
It's a good looking car but I don't like that it look like European car don't like American anymore
and much much more. this new corvette is awesome, and it looks great !
How much
Not like it's more expensive than a house
It’s still a Chevy
💳💥💳💥💳💥💳💥💳💥💳💥
I bought a c7 new in 2014 I still have it 35k miles on it now...  Best choice ever granted I paid cash for it back then.  It would be a terrible choice if it was bleeding me dry every month. Every time I can chirp 3rd gear it makes me smile and even 7 years later if your on the fence about buying a corvette just do it if you can. My car has seen the track ... a lot like hundreds of miles the systems kept me alive and I've had a blast. Chasing down a turbo 911 or some tricked out mustang on the track is nothing short of bliss and the Corvette takes you there. I think the cost was 68k for my 2lt z51 in 14  worth . Every . Penny .
I get it ur Rich like lol
It’s beyond ugly.
So badass!
Nice
That’s Chevy for ya, showing up late with things that every company has already done better
It disgusts me that they call that a stingray.
When I didn't read anything or hear anything at first I thought this was a gta 5 car
The only downside of this car is that it's built by Chevy.
It looks like a lamborghini....
This car is nice and sucky at the same time
So much extra weight and gimmicks. Give me a gutted interior with a stick and no electronics. Maybe a few speakers and a aux cord and I'm good
Forget lambo this is my dream car
i have that car like 5 of them in gta online
This guy talks like this was sponsored by chevy
All the new cars have these cameras its nothing new
I only recognized this car because it's my favorite in GTA5 ONLINE
Made this video just to flex 😂😂
but this car was so scary......engine in the middle????of course if this car explode no escape for you poor driver...you're going to be a roasted human.
I absolutely love the Corvette series. One of my favorite cars ever
Can I have your car
Lol he called them trunks bro they’re two glove compartments 😂😂
My dude, talk normally, it would make the video considerably better
Sweeeeeeeeeeet  Lambovet
Things that don't: it's mid-engined  Wish we could turn back time...
I want this car not because of you know I'm just reasons but because honestly it looks and sounds super cool
the background music is headie one - princess cuts
Lol wait till all the cameras fail and you’ve only learned to back up on those
Ahhh man that car is looking kind of dukey not gonna lie
The LAST thing you'd WANT in your BURGER KING BURGER
Things that are nice…Chev finally catching up.
Yeah but how much is it??😂
The bumper thingies are sick tho
Things that make sense: This car is a car.
Looks like a Ferrari kit car someone built in their backyard
God bless yall, Jesus loves yall and He wants you to be saved 🙏 John 3:16 romans 10:9-10 Have a blessed day yall 🙌🙏
That car is trying to be both a lambo & Ferrari at the same time, Ferrari front. Lambo back.
That’s a Ferrari
Him: Corvette Me:Coquette D10
the way he's talking is just cringe man
We use to drive these kind of vehicles back in the 1930's show me something new
My amc going to moon and Im a going to get me one in lime green!!!!
These look sooo much better in person!
Pretty cool to see them using tech that all the big supercars have been using for a couple decades!
Is it just me but in the first clip it looked like an rc car not actual size
So basically, it's for drivers that aren't very good at driving.
Things that just make sense: on this 70000 car you can take the top off! But did I mention manually?
When the trunk is smaller than a bicycle basket 🧺 :'D
THIS IS A POOR MAN'S FERRARI AND EVERYBODY THAT ACTUALLY RESPECTED THE CORVETTE BEFORE THEY CHANGED IT TO MID ENGINE HAS LOST RESPECT FOR IT IT IS NO LONGER A CORVETTE IT IS JUST ANOTHER ONE OF THE SUPERCARS 🤬
I wish I was you
You get a trunk and a frunk cool
I should get one...  I just need like 600000$ or so
My RAV4 has the rear mirror camera, and the mirror has a much cleaner look 😂
Too bad chevys are pieces of shit
I love this car it’s absolutely beautiful
Ah yes the 2 tiny ass trunks barely make up for one regular sized trunk
A supercar which is actually had an upgrade
My dad has the camera mior thing to
Gay
That cool race data thingy.... Be aware... District Attorneys will love it too.
My crush wants the car that’s her dream car
Let's be honest You are never gonna use the performance data recorder
Help I only have 2 eyes
Do people not know how to drive🤦🏼‍♂️ I don’t need 70 cameras
Bruh this looks lile a more angular 458. Not that I like either
When the engine burns it cooks you right from where you sit. Such a brilliant design.
Sounds good now i Can carry 2 hostages at one time
sometimes i kinda forget it’s chevy lmao
So innovative and original, where do they come up with these things 😐
I would of been more impressed with an optional manual transmission.
Another thing that just makes sense is tgat it drives
CHEBBY CORBETTE GOBBLESS
people: saying this video is just common information  the title of the video: literally things that just make sense
Why would you need the car to raise up when you can bring your own plates to go over bumps? It’s good exercise anyway. https://youtu.be/y5FsNaqgCh4
You mean you get two little cubby holes. One for each shoe.
Last fact you can tell not even he cared he just said also 😂😂
Ruined the Corvette!! Thank ya Chevrolet
Ew
U wouldn’t catch me dead in one of these
Because the engine is in the middle, you get a trunk. WELL NO FUCKING SHIT
Really "inspired" by Lamborghini.
So about $1 million?
I like the corvettes from the 70"s and  80's. These new cars look too much like everyone  elses car. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣https://youtu.be/Iup92VYMulk
Jonah Hill doing car reviews now?
How expensive
And everything will only break after about 10,000 miles!
Buy a Tesla instead the storage room is about the same.
This is cool and all, and I'm sure its an amazing car, but it still doesn't resemble a corvette in the slightest, and thus, I hate it
It also comes with a steering wheel which is hugely practical
So their adding features that have been on Mercs and shit for 2 decades? How is this cool? It’s modern tech. It’s actually been around probably longer than a lot of people reading this comment. But because it’s new to the corvette… it’s new period. Fuckin GM people…
My dad had a Corvette C5
that's not even a Corvette stingray that's a Corvette c8
- that color 🤢
I know I’m getting older when the most exciting thing to me was all the different camera angels
Beautiful car. Took the Daytona performance package to a new level. Took great notes from their competition 392 Daytona Charger. Only thing is that It's not as comfortable to sit in just like it's little brother the camaro.  Cool look though. Would suck to blow the engine and die from it burning through to the middle of the vehicle to where your at. GOD forbid your unconscious when it catches fire also.  🙈🙉🙊
Junk.. plain and simple
It's still just a Corvette.
Tf did I just watch
Wow, can't wait to never be able to afford this.
Looks like they’ve ripped off the Gallardo.
Tracking your lap times? I wonder how many C8 buyers actually take their car to the track?
this car is really nice but honestly a piece of shit. just 2 days ago this guy who just bought the car less than 500 miles on it  took it to a track and locked the rear end up within the second lap i had to tow it back to the dealership for him.
Choadally, bra. 🤙
Jesus talk slower would you
Filled to the brim with flimsy electronic equipment that will surely fail in less than a decade and will be a costly nightmare to repair in a shop and near impossible to repair on your own. Hurray! It's basically a gas powered tesla.
There is no way this car is still under $70k
Basically an American Ferrari
A list of things that has been available on many cars for many years.
Acting like it’s the first mid engine car ever.
Practically a better version of a ferrari.
The camera on top is a gap cam
Lmfao, Comet from Robloxian Highschool.
It's too long. Looks strange.
Things that I can’t afford anytime soon: 🙂
This is just a YouTube flex my guy
“This is *NOT* a backup camera!” 5 seconds later: “It’s a rear view camera!”  Guess it can’t be used when you’re reversing... Too bad...
This video would be really entertaining to somebody who’s absolutely fucking brain dead
So it’s an MR2 with an LS in where the 3s should be
One of the best way to spending 70000$
Yk, if you can’t drive without “curbing” I mean that’s just a driving problem not a technology problem lmao.
Not a stingray but keep trying mort u will figure it out  Hint look up Corvette c8
Not to mention the sweet ass price tag
Things that just make sense: any modern mid-engine super car
That's not a corvette that's a fucking ferrari (I know it's a corvette but it could pass as a ferrari)
It's automatic. Everything else doesn't matter. This car is for women.
Damn it looks so weird without a spoiler
Too bad it’s still a Chevy.. #Mahk
Put contraband in the front feds would never look
The language anglish is horrible..,..
They make sense because they’re standard on every other mid engine sports car
The narrator sounds like hes Bright Side, 5 minute crafts, and Top 5 all in one with a bit of WatchMojo.
Now I want one because of that.
American car 🤡
Too bad they screwed up the design so it looks nothing like a Corvette
It's just so hideous. Everything about it is revolting. This will never become a classic like the others
Its like americans are finnaly learning how to build propper sports cars that can actually take corners
I have that car in the crew 2 it's a cool car
So, when the engine catches fire; cause it will with half the drivers out there, it doubles as a rotisserie for some good ol' southern BBQ. 🏎💥🍗
It has cameras and different suspension modes and it even… has a screen it it that tells you stuff
This guy clearly hasnt heard of bags
I'm waiting to see the ev version. 😯
What happens when it breaks down
Ok that makes me want one even more
Until you need to do maintenance on the engine
Freaking Corvette baby!!
This looks like my dream car
Things that make sense on a Corvette: it has an engine.
Range Rover had that 3 inch lift every time you turn it on but on a vette it's definitely needed
That's me Matthew Hall Rogers I'm him
I want one. 😍
It’s still shit.
I hate the Whole C8 lineup. C7 and the C7 ZR1 is better
This car looks amazing
Amazing I'll be exploring these features in 2050 when I can afford this car
Its a c8 not a stingray
Chevy is the Walmart of auto makers
Wow it has the features you’d expect from a mid engine sports car... what a surprise 😂
I hope this will be in the new nfs
Fun fact: Two kids I went to school with (in a class of 100 students) died behind the wheel in corvette accidents in their 20’s.
But real question is it stick
That color don't make sense loll
Congrats you got a half size boot
American mclaren
Nice features. Hardly.novel, though. But it's fine for an American car.
The first one is in basically every other mid engine car 😐c'mon did u rlly not know
Anyone who plays gta knows this car is irl version of the coquette d10
Looks slow
He kind a looks like It looks like a poor man’s Lamborghini or a McLaren I like it
Things that other sportscars have had for years: Chevy Corvette
I've decided if I ever become excessively rich this will be the most expensive car I'll ever own.
It's that car from gta5
It’s not a stingray it’s a c8
Never say that agen just call it the corvette
Looks like plastic crap waste of money do you know when leave the new car lot it depreciates faster than a wod on my x girls face and that's 2min 4 me
Finally an American car that looks good.  Probably has leaf springs 😂😂
It’s still a Ferrari..... not a Corvette anymore. The whole point of a Corvette is a short wheel base powerful rear wheel drive car wanting to kill you. Thanks Chevy 🤦🏼‍♂️
It has the same features as my Honda Civic
If only they did this to most cars
“Things that just make sense.”  Watching every other corvette video on YouTube and reiterating everything they said word for word
Scraping is where the fun is at
But can it corner
Price
Emilia should sell her c8 and buy this
Things that make sense? The whole thing? How about flaws?
We get it u have money
Lol this the typa shit for non Car ppl, getting impressed by bags 🤣and cameras
The most important thing you forgot to mention. The average joe can't afford it!!😂
I just wish they didn’t make look like a Ferrari so much
Orrrrrr... Buy a new bronco and lift kit it.
This is the only american car that i would buy!
All fun and games till it’s starts to lag
Eu achando que era de brinquedo 👁️👄👁️
thats a nice looking car, and the color compliments it well
Yo! My Honda-e 2021 has a lot of the features 2. exept its electric
My mothers 1.6 tdi vw golf SV has a lap timer and performance recorder, such as turbo boost and mpg etc.
I don’t wanna see a Chevy corvette I want the LEGO one
Chevy never build a reliable transmission
Garbage car my friend has the same color and transmission blew at 8000 miles
How are you that annoying? Just talk normally..
Wtf how can they call that a stingray the stingray was gorgeus this is not
Now it looks like any other MR supercar.........zzzzzzzzzz No sexy tail
Fucking dope
Should have had the raising feature years ago
You’re like 2 years late on all of this info...
E
Gotta save money for this beast.
Fun fact: the trunk in the front is actually called a fronk
Chevy lol worst car to own in general any American car made is shit nothing compared to Japanese
Fam, I didn’t see cupholders. Therefore, this car doesn’t make sense
That’s justttt makes senssssse
Nice now I can store two dead bodies
Ugliest car I’ve ever seen
Dope bro
Things everyone already knows about the C8 Corcette
Back looks like a Camaro and the front a Ferrari.
This was an awful awful video
Love this car!
Why do all super n hyper cars hv almost indistinguishable identical shape like this one?... Only bugatti has been able to set itself apart from the generic rest...
Sounds like a hot ride, literally
My 2020 Mercedes C43 AMG has all that stuff standard. Except for the raising crap
Well every midengine car have almost all of this feature
Omg I’ve never seen a mid engine car 😱
Way better than Toyota Supra!
Ahh the car with the  Tramp stamp nice one  Chevy 👏👏👏
That’s fucking awesome. Is that all stock options?
Give me a carburator and crank windows
Never knew me trying to hit 190 in that thing down the high way was “ lap time”
C8
That’s a cool car.
Yeah no.   Good luck replacing 5 modules just to fix the radio   Nothing worse than electrical gremlins especially nowadays where cars are designed to breakdown prematurely
That mirror cam dope af
We just gonna ignore those awkwardly positioned buttons?
I’m a Tesla owner, but not gonna lie, i love this car
It's all good til something tears up. The vette has been molested so much that its become one of the fastest depreciating cars sold.
Lap times are the best, I always need to know if I'm covering two blocks or three blocks in new York in an hour.
Amazing but just wanna say the my favorite car in the whole world is a 90’s car and it had more then just a lap timer on the screen! R34 M-Spec Nür Skyline!!!! 😂🤣😅
It doesn't JUST make sense  It makes ALOT of SENSE
Slam it in park
I don't trust a car when the engine is in the middle
I’m just in love with this car!
I hate it. Don't get me wrong it looks like a great car...... just not a Corvette. Chevy has removed everything that made the Corvette what it was and just made a generic sports car.
Yeah, it all makes sense now - except the bit about actually making it.
Ok
Me who only owns a 5 year old broken Honda: 👁️👄👁️
Which color is it? To me it looks like my favorite color, lime/neon green
A wanna be Lamborghini, nice
What about the price?
Every one of those buttons are $10k
Now they need to get rid of those ugly colors
Alternative Title: How to flex on the poor
The rims on this car are hideous. Other than that the car is great.👍
But can it go 10k without replacing the push roads 🤔
Hopefully this is a sign that all modern cars will eventually adopt this tech (maybe not on standard options) 👌🏼
Wow the added a button that raises the car so you don’t scrape it… wooohooo not technology that’s has been used on every super car since like 2009 and they even had a way to do it before that called airbags…. Not very exciting
Can no one spell since anymore. There is sense like what you smell and and since like that hasn't happened since ....
Don't like the idea of having cameras on the car, mirrors do the job for me.
Knock of an aventadoor
This guy should be a newscaster. Why do YouTube people all feel the need to use a ridiculous voice? Talk normally and I'd be more interested.
Rather have a Ford GTA
I hear a lot of complaints but I liiiiiiiiiiiike it
Things that don't make sense: the back of the car looks like a camaro, and those exhaust look bad. Everything else makes sense
One thing that doesn’t make sense is the crappy steering wheel
Nah
Really made it more suitable for older people now. Cameras everywhere to avoid curbs.
So they copied the style of the Ford GT but made it slower and less cool.... ok, go Chevy ...I guess 🤔
Anyone saying Chevy just copied Ferrari doesn't know anything about Corvette history.
I hate my life lol.  I'll never have one.  Sad day 😞
It’s not an American muscle car   It’s a Netflix adaptation of a Ferrari
😱😱😱😱😱😱😳😳😳😳😳😳🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 hell yeah American made🇺🇲🇺🇸🇺🇲🇺🇸🇺🇸
Doors that open it just makes sense
Couldn't watch more than 5 seconds. You drag your voice out just to extend watch time
None of it makes sense ..... it’s been a front engine rear wheel drive car since the 50s... let’s adopt the European style now almost 70years later ... it’s like making the charger a 4 door and not having a 2 door model though it was only a 2 door car
Do not care
That's not a backup camera it's a back up camera
so... tech copied from Porsche and Lamborghini... still a Chev at the end of the day. Respect for the classic vets.
Lmao looks like the first Lambo everyone bought on GTA as a starter.
Chevy: we built a cool car it goes fast  Test driver: I cant see out the back window  Chevy: slaps camera on back "bam fixed"
It’s called a Frunk
Ads be like
Corvette C8 not Corvette stingray
The only thing that make sense is the small stingray on the back trunk
This is literally discount Doug Demuro 😂😂 this guy try’s to act like he knows stuff about cars when he’s clearly a brainlet 🥱
I’m gonna get this car one day inshallah
So what every old air-cooled vw other than the bus had a frunk (front trunk)
GM is king of cameras
Talking bout how useful a car is that at least 60% of us will never have or see in person.
The sizes of those two trunks combined is half the size as the truck in my fbody
Okey I need this
I had the 2014 and 2015 convertibles. Miss those cars. This looks like a huge improvement.
I totally agree that those features are all awesome features, but none of them are new tech by any means, not even close.  The front end raising system has been around for over a decade
I saw that car 2 days ago on the way too see my brother at the airport
I watch this  things  top gear 2002  on a Lamborghini
Until all the electronics fail and you are stuck on the side of the road
These things better be on a car, considering the price.
What's these run($)?
Price?
I totally didn’t know this already
Man this car is beautiful. I want one so bad
Things about the knew Chevrolet Corvette Stingray that don’t make sense: Rob Dahm trying to swap a rotary into one.
I have this car in gta
Low expectation mans rari
This is basically "Let me show you poor people a cool luxurious car you cant afford to get!" Type of video, basically every video of the likes. But i do like to watch these types of videos every now and then.
See  a car that you can’t order and dealers sticker price is an additional 30,000 🤣🤣🤣
Can you say mixed McLaren and Camaro 🤣
cool! now I can put bodies in the front of my trunk so the cops won't be able to arrest me
Lets name this video things Corvette has copied from Ferrari
Soooo the camera mobile? 😳
Corvette Corvette 🔥🔥
God I wish I had that carrrrr ahhhh!!
Corvette more like Coolvette 😎
Clearly copied Ferrari’s front ride hight system famous to the the enzo! Not hating on the US but you guys love European designs it’s the same with your 18wheelers a lot including petes use DAF Paccar engines now and Cascadias use Mercedes engines and running gear and electrics but yeah this front ride hight system is old tech now , nice car the corvette though I really think it doesn’t need that system it’s un American the car looks European where’s that muscle car look I love so much haha

Looks a hell of a lot like a 360modena.
I feel like Chevy's playing ketchup.
Trunk in the front: can hold a jug of milk Trunk in the back: can hold a box of cereal This guy: Grocery shopping complete
they got a built in gapplebs cam
it’s on bags 🤯🤯🤯
That's not a backup camera. It's a camera you use when backing up
These things are in so many cars. Not only in this car. Not rly special
trash
It’s like a mix between a camro and a Corvette with a touch of lambo 😂😂
So, it has a lot of "features" that are just workarounds for poor design choices?
Who else is looking at exotic cars to see which they will get with their amc gains
80% of these designs were put in play by Ferrari, considering they designed the car.
Ijs.. looks like a Ferrari in the front..
literally every car here in australia has rear cameras above the plate
Thought that was good? Watch this! It’s hilarious! I guarantee it’s the funniest thing you’ll ever watch!!  LINK: https://youtu.be/w6jz0qqiEPI
Tbh I'm 6'7" and need a camera to see out the front. Can't even lower the seat 😂
My camaro ss also has the same rear view mirror camera
Ngl.. kinda looks like Chevrolet & Ferrari worked together on it
hell yeah twice as many body's
They give you an international SuperSport car look for a fraction of the cost. Bravo Chevy. Thought it was a Ferrari
Looks like a Ferrari
What the hell is that shifter??? It looked like it was a bunch of buttons to shift which would immediately make this a horrible car
I know it’s a Vette, but for me, that yellow is just not one of them. 🤮
I hate this car. I'm surprised they didn't get sued. It copies basically the exact same as a McLaren
Chevy always makes the best cars but they usually cost too much. It's like either buy this legit Chevy or get a benz, BMW, or Audi at the same price and those foriegns are sports luxury so...
Free hydrualics is all i see
It’s a mid rear engine not a mid engine car.... 🤦‍♂️
That car looks awsome
I would rather have one big trunk than two small trunks. In theory, two small ones have more total space than the single big one, but the maximum size for an individual object you can put in the car will be bigger for the single big trunk.
Looks like crap.
Hay
our toyota rav 4 hybrid 2021 has that camera thing in the rear view
People are impressed by anything today.
Yeah cool car I just purchased one
After driving the new Tesla’s, this all seems like pathetic caveman-like attempts to copy Tesla features.
This car is so good that you sould only keep it in America
The new Stingray just makes sense
So basically Chevy finally entered the 21st century
Is it just me who hates almost everything that he mentioned?
😍😍😍😍
Still copied Ferrari Lamborghini copied all those kind of supercars
Walmart Ferrari
I absolutely love Chevys, from the Colorado to the Corvette. Lately I've been restoring a 1970 Camaro. But to me these newer cars are liken to ceiling fans in that for every two unnecessary features they have another feature that's just way too much of a good thing.
It come stock with bags bruh no wonder the price
I don’t own one… and I never will. but i still watched it
My moms Subaru has cameras like that
Theres only one major thing wrong with this car... its a chevy LMFAO
The Camaro needed that rear view cam....
You can tell a stupid American made this because they are freaking out that a sports car has a lift setting, Idk what you guys eating over there but it seems like most of you forget to eat your Wheaties as the goody American saying goes 🙄
“Trunk” can’t hold shit
That's a sorry excuse for a "trunk"
Soo cool. Not as cool as the Chevy express though.
So corvette was muscle than spot and now super thats stupid go back muscle. Muscle car are better
Lap times? Wow now that's useful... I drive to get faster all day
Fucking amazing
Who agrees with me that the trunk in the bag is specifically made for full size rifles and they are pistols look at it it's look at that s***....?
Meanwhile I hope dodge doesn't replace the Vipers V10.
This bug
Rich kid vibes
Yep, handy features I had on my Audi RS6 a year ago!
I’m on vacation in Galveston Texas, and there is a straight behind me, I saw a person with this car just going in huge circles with their brand new stingray, happy as can be
They should call it Corvette F22; it looks like an F22 Raptor😲
Its funny, if I want to drive cars like this all I have to do is open up GTA 5 and just cruise the streets of San Andreas
The only things that make sense about this car is that you probbably cant drive it over speedbumps, and the features only Make sense to a rich fuck.
Basically all you are saying when you buy one of those is I’m never going to have enough money for a super car but this’ll do
Its not a stingray
All I see is an endless money pit and that I’ll never be able to afford one 😅
This car is perfect for noise making because you just open the front trunk and say it's electric 😂
It’s a Chevy Malibu.
So you can incriminate yourself they made a lap timer built in it lol
I love corvette but it doesn't make sense when Tesla model 3 is faster on acceleration and that's not even comparing with the model s Way faster
It didnt deserve the name corvette
For as much as that thing costs it doesn't do enough 🤷‍♂️
Still not a Porsche 🤷🏾‍♂️
Looks like a garage-made Ferrari.
It reminds me a lot about a Ferrari 430
New one looks ugly AF, the model before looks better, this dont look like a Corvette at all, they did what Nissan did and hoped the brake lights fool people lol. If a car looks like a beetle, but they add Corvette lights, that dont make it a Corvette lol. Soon all cars gonna be shaped like eggs I guess so they slowly trying to change it over time I guess lol
Things that make sense about this car: *It has doors*
Muscle cars fear my 300zx
Why is this In my yt shorts For the second time
You get the engine in the middle  Me - yeah cuz that make sense ....... Him - drives car 250 mph  Good luck when you feel the overheat or should I say the under heat.....
Ugliest Corvette of all time
This is not the stingray that was the c3 this is either the c7 or c8, witch is not the stingray
Those r pieces of shit, it looks like an import doesnt look anything like wat a corvette should look like!! It looks like shit tbh!!
Yes officer it’s electric
bruh they have a track recorder?! this car was meant to race
Thank you Chevy for putting a rear facing camera because you design cars with poor visibility.
@davine jay
@davins ja
How much? I will take two
Too bad they didn’t have that back in the 60s. The V back with the column in the middle was a pain.
Used to luv corvettes when I was...much younger but they're just too much now. Bad ass yes but not a muscle car anymore.
my 1969 corvette stingray is better no cap
Years ago, Chevrolet had the.."Sledgehammer" Callaway Corvette, sporting a 454 c.i. d. engine. Buuuut..that 454 was NOT a "Chevy" motor...& had been manufactured BY..."Mercury" Marine. Hmm...perhaps as in the..Ford/Lincoln..""Mercury"??
Things that i cant afford😂😂
so cool
Other than the fact that Chevy is starting to make their sports cars look like lambos, this thing is pretty sweet.
Bring back the pop up head lights and stop trying to copy Lamborghini already! You can tell this car was made by people who didn't like the traditional Corvettes but lacked imagination of their own.
Yea this is by far the best Vette ever. Looks, mods and tech 🔥🔥🔥
Still, it's an American car. So... NO thanks
Someone just take the phone away from this guy. He says “things that JUST make sense” and then he proceeds to show amazing features of the car like how tf can you be this stupid
Damn too bad it’s a Chevy don’t worry I’ll come pick you up in my Ford when it breaks down
Wow welcome to 2012
Chevy copied Ford with it GT
It kind of looks like something out of the 90s
The colour is appalling.
bro half of those features are on my toyota corolla 💀💀
What don't make sense though, is how that door vent is partially a part of the door. Makes it nice and ugly when open. Though you never see a C8 w it's doors open. Hideous.
hmmm still whack! could think of better cars to purchase.
Im not 90 years old, i dont need cameras to park.
"What's cool is because the engine is in the MIDDLE, you get a trunk back here AND up here."  Every other mid-engined car ever:
I can’t get over how it sort of looks like a lambo
Its going to be a little to hot to literally sit on that hot middle engine in the summer, for a non electric.
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17-For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.
I mean it has a door and wheels so yeah it's pretty useful to me
What about putting some NOS to reach the 75mph?
Chevy knows no cat that’s buying this is gonna be working on it themselves
New dream car
How does this guy get access to all these nice cars for these videos?
Looks like the ugly duckling.
Do a car review instead.
Or you could just watch Doug Demiro
Nobody: literally nobody.  Idiots: people who make fun of corvettes  because they are not as good as porches or Lamborghinis that are 200k more.
Literally nothing about this makes sense. Car too low? RAISE IT UP. No buttons, motors, or wires required.
song in the background
No standard?
Oh yeah great air suspension so if you have a flat tyre and you don’t know about jacking mode goodby suspension
Engine in the middle? So, four dead or injured instead of two?
In the front trunk is the baby holder
Should've keep the american look, looks to european
Looks awfully similar to a car I use to drive in Burnout Revenge 🤔  Iykyk
Might have to cop, how much???
The thing that doesn’t make sense is the price hikes or “dealer adjusted markup.” Also modding that thing cost so much.
Looks like a mclaren 12c spyder and an aventador had a baby
That's a C8 zo7 model
Overall it’s pretty awesome. My biggest complaint is the wheels are too small for that supercar mid engine look. The body around the wheels needs to allow for more room.
Never drive this in Houston unless you can afford bumper replacement every other week😂
Meh looks like a lambo..
It looks like a LaFerrari rip off
Nothing makes sense Corvette did fine for years no need to change it like that bring this guy to Europe and leave it there
Gimme
Looks like a lambo
Damn let’s go I can get a 2 piece of kids at the same time. 😂😂😂 disclaimer it’s a joke
https://youtu.be/vgCXYCc2CPc
Performance Data Recorder. For the judge to view after your huge speeding ticket.
Only make sense cause it was designed in Europe, to compete in Europe. That's why all make sense.
So you're just going to leave us hanging and not tell us what the top rear camera is for?
Looks like a new nsx model
Why is he talking like he's being held hostage
Gay! All of this is fixed if you man up and buy a truck
That looks very similar to a lambo
Hell yeah I want that...👌👌
Budget super car part is neat, completely different body style is not favorable. I mean, the corvette design was a classic, signature look for Chevy. Then they just abolished it and made it look like a cheap Ferrari.
Imagine the engine blows up, you just turn into popcorn
I'd literally rather one Vs a Ferrari, a person I work  with bought one and it looks fkn insane
Stupid piece of shit car want to be Ferrari. Gave up all the heritage of being America's muscle car to be a poser European car that just loses races to electric cars
This car is juicy af I would love to buy it if I could
Sheesh
Just waiting for them to literally create transformers
It’s just a big Fiero
My Vauxhall Corsa still wins
Ill buy that car tomorrow, who wants some?
She's pretty
You dnt have the Tik tok voice. How disappointing 😁
They made some cool additions to the car. Too bad the thing is an abomination
Hey why dosent Chevy sell tow trucks. Cause there tow trucks are all ready hooked up to the back of a Ford tow truck.
There is like 8 cameras on the new duramax trucks
All while being too expensive for 99% of consumers
Stop flexing you no life
Something else that would've just made sense was to make it look like a Corvette
How the hell are you gonna get to the engine if it breaks?
Man, European supercars have been doing these things for years...
Vertical video does not make sense.
*buys corvette because "cool" factor*
So we designed a car for people who don't know the fundamentals of driving. I.e backing up, checking mirrors just overall head movement...
Fuckin mint
Luxury Car Video - shot on an iPhone? I don't get it
I fucking haaate the rims on this car they really ruin it for me
If you can't get a lambo than you get a Corvette and if you can't get that you get a Camaro and if you can't get that there will always be a mustang but always that one guy that tries to hard to make you believe he only and only ever want a mustang
Comming this car to Forza Horizon 5?
T20..... anyone no just me okay
The motionless racing expectantly instruct because stool disturbingly unite via a damp narcissus. jumpy, ossified bee
I'm sorry but that is not a corvette. It just looks like a slightly chunkier Honda nsx with some more lines and edges...
Engine in the middle?! WTF!!!
sadly all those people that bought the new corvette when it first come out are in for a depressing moment.the 2022 model body style is different,which in turn will make the first ones look old and out of date.
🅘 🅜🅐🅚🅔 🅥🅘🅓🅔🅞🅢 🅣🅞🅞. ☆☆
When did corvettes start looking so… European? This looks like a Lotus had a baby with a Lambo.  Don’t get me wrong, I love European style (I am one) - but as a European, if I buy a Corvette, I want it too look American.
😆 GOOD LUCK WITH THAT POS TRANSMISSION ✌ I Returned mine!!
Kitni awesome haii 😍
IT is a c8
Watcha gonna do with all that junk... all that junk??  Well first off I will put some in the front and some in the rear of my trunks
I love that car, but it just looks like a Ferrari with a corvette badge and tail lights.
Standard features in similar cars from years, not really impressive, car's kinda ugly tho, very ugly from the back
It looks old as fuck already
Things about the chevy corvette that are present in a lot of other cars
I'll get it if they m as ke EV version
That's probably the sexiest Corvette I've ever seen.
I wish I could afford one. But I can't afford to pay attention right now
Why did he show his drivers plate
m8 u left ur water bottle out there
Copying Tesla per usual. MS has adjustable suspension height w gps memory as well. Frunk, cameras, etc
Is that Chris from total drama island?
Tbh I wish chevy would have sold these for 300k and limited them. They were so beautiful and was like finally a mid engine Corvette, but now I see them everywhere. In my neighborhood alone I have seen 2.
Wait how do you get to the engine
First off that shouldn't be considered a stingray. Has no similarity to the 1960s Stingray
Raiclse the front, yeah, hope it's high enough to get over the large driveway entrances that literally barely inch your vehicle on!
Miss the original... before they started making these cars look like lambos.
Things about the new Corvette that dont make sense.  Its a mid engined car
Be good if all sport cars had them and normal ones
That’s a camaro and nobody can tell me otherwise. Nothing but Ls.
Chevy rented a few ferraris and took them apart and copied everything they suck so bad they have to copy a real super car and still did a shitty job copying.
That car looks awesome
I have to sell my mom and dad's car also their house to afford this Car but i will do it.
The corvette has had its engine in the middle since the c4.
Does it come with a hair piece for men?
WAIT WHAT???? NOW I WANT ONE!!
This better be in horizon 5
I have this in crew 2
2020 Fiero.
Too bad it’s a Stingray and not a Z06 though
Fuck that. This thing has so many sensors and gizmos its definitely tracking and sending all this information about you off to someone
It was just a matter of time before they started making the vette look like euro trash
He ain't even mention that it's mid-engine
It look like a Ferrari spider 😂😂😂😂
Love everything on it
all of this is great but... chevy still uses push rods
Can I have that car
Is this gonna be released in Australia?
These options come standard on most if not all supercars
Beautiful!!!!
Ford GT is way better
It's curbing, not curving
Looks like a ferrari
Working on BMW and Mercedes cars and SUVs that come standard with dynamic suspension since the early 2000’s, I can confidently say that WHEN, not IF, but WHEN that breaks, it’ll be and easy $10,000+ repair. Have fun with your corvettes. Shits a living nightmare
So many features for people that don't know how to drive
About time they made a corvette look like a race car
Why do I view things I can't afford let alone see in person. Maybe in next life.
Kool
It would be better if it was electric
"A Drug Dealer's Dream Car"
It just looks so much like the one in gta
Me thinking how I'd still manage to ding it up
The only thing on this that is necessary or actually cool is that they put a frunk but it isn’t even that good because they had to move the engine
Corvette, the most advanced American sportscar. Still 10 years behind the Italians.
Because I’m sure you’ll be doing a ton of laps! 99% of the people who own the new Corvette for the next decade will be geriatrics,or Women who maybe see 3/4 throttle once every 6 months.
Its so damn ugly. Looks like a cheap replica of a mid engine super car.
tbh they wasted money on tht bump one bc who is going to rmb tht they have a button to go over a bump from all those years of drivin cars without it ppl wont really kno its there
Can I buy it? NO because it's made for rich people who steal from the people that cannot afford neither bicycle
I hate sports cars but if I have to get one it’ll be this one
Wow don’t even have it in the rare silver, psshhhh Peasant
The ugliest car ever.
The Americans thinking they've got cool stuff when stuff like this has been around since 2007. Yanks are funny. Control their people, come up with "new ideas" then silence you fot exposing them. Murica lmao
This guys a more positive navs garage, way less annoying gotta admit
Things that makes sense u will not be able to buy it. Unless its 10bdollars
Things that car just make car a car: car
Things about this car that just don’t make sense      The price
Stingray garbage 😁😁😁😂😂😂😂😂
There is nothing useful about that car it's a piece of shit Chevy needs to go back to the drawing board.
It’ll also throw a rod and lifter failure will come soon
But it isnt an e-car.
Cool 🔥
Horrible car... the stance is so awkward and build is so cheap
I'm in Canada.  Corvette makes  No sense here
Remember when cars were lucky to come out of the dealership with seatbelts?
Two small ass trunks. Nice.
Usually these videos showcase features that dont make sense but this one actually did make sense like all of the features are incredibly smart and convenient I love chevy
This is literally every super car it’s nice that Chevy finally made a true performance car but these features are standard
SHEEEEESHHH Belinda Anderson works here and I'm her son
This car is an absolute beast. I've taken it for a test drive. One of my uncles has a red one, and another uncle has a blue one.
even with the raising suspension. that shit would scrape driving down the road at my house. steep assss hill
Tesla owners: I cant even remember a thing they said 😐
Doesnt matter how many improvement or new features on it. I cant afford it anyway. hahaha
It's ugly tho
Damnnn
It better make fuckimg sense
No American cars make sense
That’s shit on baggs
Why buy a car that goes 120+ when you can’t even drive that speed all the time smh
These are just standard things other cars had way earlier…
looks like a lambo
damn does it drive though
It's just a montage of replicated parts from other super cars.
The first corvette to actually make sense, too bad they're like 20 years behind other supercars.
Its like Toon Desk but with actually interesting content
🌎👍🚘🌏
Okay imma buy this
Fuck Stingrays   RIP Steve Irwin
So the US is making knockoff lamborghinis now? 😂
Better than a Tesla lmao
corvette corvette
Ah, yes, another “hey, look at my expensive car, isn’t that cool, poor people?” video. Please block me so I don’t have to see this crap anymore.
This is literally "Top 5 Fortnite YouTubers who've sworn" kind of video title.
I find it weird to have a car that requires more cameras to drive it properly. Sounds more like a design flaw.
Poor man's Ferrari
I think the rear brake lights need to be round. It’s a signature look.
The corvette is officially gone forever. What we have here is a ferrari, lambergini, some form of sports/hyper car rip off (i know they spelt wrong). They sold their souls to the italian styling department and that there is NOT what comes to anybodys mind when they think of the corvette. 🤮 same as allllllllll the other sports cars out there, couldnt pick it out of a line up.
Am poor
Ugliest car I have ever seen
Is it electric?
Honestly hate that Chevy made this, C8 was the last good Corvette and the reason I don't like the stingray is because it looks like a BMW I8 and a Lambo had a baby.
Looks like a Ferrari
She took her pants down while maintaining absolute eye contact with the camera...  Is it allowed??
“How innovative!” said no enthusiast ever about this car’s features.
Already beginning to look like a used Fiero
I'm so happy this isn't one of those morons complaining about a perfect condition Tesla
It isn't new. But man the dudes voice just annoys me, like it just sounds like there's a delay with each word
Chevy also put in a button that will make your father love you back
It's not a vette. This model is only available with a slush box. How utterly disappointing.
Is it in manual ?
That color is literally the best. It looks so exotic
things about the new chevrolet corvette that I still don't understand: it still uses push rods? why? why are we stuck in the stone age with this particular part? could make it better with just a simple change to, idk OHC but no, push rods. At this point it's just a massive middle finger to every other company that basically says that the engine is simpler but still as effective. TL:DR push rod stone age go brrr
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Engine IN THE MIDDLE! How do you maintain it?
Let me say another thing just makes sense . You dont have the money.
Ummm bro the NSX had that back in 1991 bruhhh
Hay at lest my car can off road without getting fucked like this car wood if it tryed
So all shit that other cars had ages ago...
It's cute,  but I'm afraid I'd wreck it. It looks like a toy car to me.
I saw that in red
I’m sold 😂
I would love to own that car.
Why the fuck would you get that in yellow?
You call that a trunk?
Ah yes, Corvette. The midlife crisis car.
Waste of money.
Thank you for not calling it a frunk
Out of all the the things you choose these stuff that are standard
Literally got the European Aggresive look but still maintains American Staunchness would definitely buy this is I had the $
i have this car in gta
🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮
Watching a video of a car I can never afford, nice
The price doesn't make sense!!!!!
Now, if they could just get it to run without any issues for a year.
I know ima get hate for this but that is the single ugliest color on a car I’ve ever seen
I immediately turned this video off because of the guys voice, so I have no idea what he thinks makes sense. Great car though.
I want a Tesla
My moms suv has that rear view mirror camera
Woah i need this
I need that
No can you see why this is my dream car
Looks like a knock off Ferrari
Still a piece of shit Chevy
The only bad thing with all bell’s and whistles is that you can’t work on it yourself anymore.  But if you are living large, then what does it matter?
i fucking hate that color scheme, the rest is cool tho
𝕴 𝖜𝖆𝖓𝖙 𝖙𝖍𝖆𝖙.
For the love of god film with your cell phone sideways. This video is so cheap-looking.  I watched it for 5 seconds and right away the videographer had no training in film.
Still trash 🗑
I try to h8, but I just massssser b8
Beautiful car😍
Nobody can just put a big engine in a midsized body anymore. Gotta have all these additions. Whatever happened to the base option? No additions, just power
Dude, I loved the colour immediately after I saw it, but I don't know how it's called
Thats why Chevies are very good
Don’t you mean the coolretty?
Mercedes already put raising the front of their cars with a touch of a button  way before corvette did
How do you work on the engine when it breaks down if it’s in the middle?
It’s not the video...  It’s the car “methodology “... giving cameras and hydraulic systems to help prevent the “idiot factor “.  If a person needs these features to maintain a $100,00 vehicle,  that person does not deserve the quality.   My honest rating for this vehicle:  3 out of 10
That’s the Tyrant on gta.
This guy is the ToonDesk for cars
Something about the front camera layout just boggles my mind. Stared at it for a minute and couldn't find out what the fuck I'm looking at. Cool idea though.
Corvette c2 Gang.
alright respect respect
Notice he never mentioned the price as making sense
I prefer my Rambler, no need to spend my retirement on these plastic cars.
I want one so bad.
It's a Lambo with Chevy badging
That car is wack
All that shit's nice but when a woman car gets older and it starts to break down $$$$$$$$
@ako si dogie waiting na bibili ka nito boss d
AUTOMATIC Boomermobile
COOL AND SMOOTH
One thing he forgot it’s a pice of sh*t
Ssshhheeessshh
Why not just buy a tesla which is faster?
God is so good! He is amazing! Believe and trust in Him! He is the Way the Truth and the Life! No one will come to the Father, but by Jesus! Amen! Repent of your sins and come to Jesus! You can find TRUE PEACE AND JOY THROUGH JESUS AND ONLY THROUGH JESUS!!!
While it LOOKS NOTHING Like any of the traditional Corvette models, it IS a very cool looking car!  I personally prefer the early 70s and the 1950s models (made of American Steel)!
This been available on porsches for a while now, yawn.
The back of it just doesnt look like a corvette, I dont like this model it smells of elderberries
Get outta here with that, the C3 and C2 Stingrays is where it's at. The new stuff is wanna be Lambos
If you put a bull in the front and told me it was a Lambo I wouldn't argue, Chevy stepn thr game up
10/10 @Chevrolet
Love the features not really big vette fan but they did give me my love for cars😁😇
There basically just copying Ferrari as much as they can now let’s be honest
FIRST UGLY AS HELL
I’d take a 1957 corvette over this
Is this for real?
I want a convertible
What's the sticker price $
Okay campers today you and your team are gonna build this car
BuT iTs NoT a ReAl CoRvEtTe. Not new concepts but it's awesome for someone like me because I'd rather have the c8 than a Lamborghini. Even of it's not the better car. I love corvettes and the c8 is the pinacle of American performance cars.
All cool and all but when you just have to replace the oils then what?
Beautiful car but that is a Corvette in name only, that is not a Corvette.
Sold
The motor doesnt exsist. It's in the middle.
It’s going to look old in 2 years, just like every other vette. The screwed the curvature of the front end- should have been sharper corners. Already looks old. I just shot one for a dealer yesterday. It was cool, but not like, insanely cool….
Things that don't make sense. That ugly ass yellow, worst colour ever.
Is it me or does this make NO SENCE
Still just a chevy
😎
Corvette putting in alot of thoughts into this car. Love everything about it
I just want to say that I hate tesla owners for starting this dumb trend. It was annoying then, it’s annoying now, and nobody gives a shit about your car.
Just buy a Tesla Plaid Model S.  Way faster and cheaper
my dream car since i was 12 😭
Damn I was really into this cars appearance but for some reason I feel like they really messed up the front end of this car this time. Not digging it.
For the price tag you better get everything shown
Wooow cameras
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Things about the new Chevrolet corvette stingray that don't make sense: THE OUTRAGEOUS MFING MARKUP PRICES!!!! 😡😡😡🤬
If only I wasn't broke as fuck... *long sigh*
Why you sound like Chris from total drama island👀
Holy crap, they made a real life version of the Coquette D10 from GTA Online?!!
Heck, just give me a 57 Bel Air sport coupe. I don’t want all that tech junk. 👍
Is that Chris from total drama Island?
Ferrari complaint in 3 ,2…
CHit Hard!!! 💯💯
Not impressed, more things need to make sense
You lost me at engine in the middle
The performance data recorder can also be used as a Dash Cam if I'm not mistaken
Nice car
In my cheap pos I've never had to stop and push a button to raise the front end to get in and out of driveways. Does "high end" mean creating problems for the rich that they'll now charge extra to solve for you?
Any mechanics out there that know what minivan had the engine under the driver seat?  Props for people that know shit about cars. Like boring blocks, rebuilding transmissions and whatnot.
There’s no shevrolai it chevrrrrrollletttttt 😓🤣
Unnecessary things that don't make sense economically
Eh. The 65 Corvette Stingray is still the best.
The recorder is a great idea until a city prosecutor subpoenas the data.
Ssssshit, that makes me want one even more now.
Last one would be good for Los Santos customs
Rip corvette
Literally looks like a Ferrari instead of an american super car fucking chevy piece of shit
Damn that C A K E  is symmetrical
Great, so Chevy is doing things finally in their cars that other auto makers have been doing for nearly 2 decades.  Way to keep up with the fucking times, Chevrolet...
Honestly i just like the front trunk
This is the best looking Corvette out of all the Corvettes
At least its price won't make any sense
"Raises the front end by gps"  that's fucking cool.  Recording locations you push it and raising it whenever you hit those locations is just an above and beyond cool feature.
Why does it look like a hybrid between a Ford GT and a McLaren?
Wow an actually smartly designed super car... Rare asf tbh
The color🤢
Thing that makes sense about it: Compared to a 1936 Chevy, it looks like Ass
Just imagine if the had put a backup camera in the 1963 split window it would have lasted longer than one year.
Buena porquería ni en corbett quiero un Chevrolet son carros bien malos. Siem  pre tienes que estar arreglándole piesas o poniéndoles nuevas yo no quiero esa porquería de carros
Cant wait 4 years for this
Literally the best production vette to date. It gives the Ford GT a workout at a fraction of the cost and with a few mods will smoke it.  Vette for the win
I feel like not enough people get the c8 in accelerate yellow ☹️
After 10 some years it finally looks like a lambo. Clap clap
I feel like Chevy actually managed what mitsubishi was trying to do with the 3000gt but failed, it had so much new tech in it but because of how early the tech was in development it just kinda flopped (4 wheel steering, active aero, viscous realtime 4wd, etc)
Check engine light: I'm about to end this man's whole career
It’s not like Lamborghini have been putting the front lift bottom in there cars for over 20 years.
Screw all that nonsense that will forever need debugging repairing, replacing. the vette was not supposed to be like this. It was supposed to be for hard working americans..now its only affordable if youre fricking hedge fund manager However, it has one of the greatest body designs i have ever seen.  beautiful. Good luck keeping it running
How much is it tho?
My grandpa got this car. I love it
tfw you’re american and think these are innovations
IT FEELS LIKE SOMEONE'S TRYING TO SELL ME SOMETHING
I hate the new corvettes look
Engine in the middle? H'yeah imma get a Mercedes.
I'm not into sports cars at all but this is pretty slick
Beautiful car, confused why it's a stingray though. It's not even a reimagining or update it's just a completely different everything.
Corvette looks so trash...
Looks like the camera is at the top let's ride. Hold up why does it look like the camera is at the bottom?
So buy a corvette? Got it👍
Wow
All those little gadgets break within the first 3 years
I loved the older corvettes i hates how they started making the back bumper flat asf i dodnt like it at all. This actually looks nice Edit: 2005-13 era are the ones i think look bad. 14-19 looks okay but i like this one
Looks like what I poop out the other day. Beautiful turf yellow and greenish
Barf
My dream car 🚗. Who wants to buy me this one
Compare that to first Corvette, which the only feature was : it drives.
Lol...it's all old tech that's been here for years.  Front lift Lamborghini way back  Fiero..mid engine with 2 trunks  How about an interior on the GMs premium car that has actual quality fit and finish? Now that I'd be impressed with.
Why do I kinda want the car-
Give it a couple years before none of that works.
Fun fact, those track recorders also record voices. I work at an auto dealership where we had got a C8 Corvette. It was pre owned but practically brand new, anyways, on the recordings we caught the previous owner talking about how he cheated on his wife. We got a good chuckle out of it before deleting it.
Body Looks similar to Mclaren
he sounds like Chris from total drama
Nothing is more baller than having two useless trunks, lol.
All these features and a $300 manual shit box would still be more fun
It seems like a lot of tech shit to make up for the things they couldn’t do right
*weights 50000 pounds
I prefer my AM FM radio in my C5
Am I the only one that Everything he just listed I already knew 😂
Still a Chevy
What an extremely dumb video, sayong common things in an enthusiastic way. Eugh
Things that don't make sense. NO MANUAL TRANS
Can I get a vote on how many ppl really like this body style ? Like who would rather this gen vert ?
They make the motors like that that way u gotta go to chevy if some.brake an charge u a good buck
Handsome American car
And it's only a measly 100k, no big whoop
So much tech just to get around bad design. Not hating though, the car looks sick. Just a funny observation.
What a beautiful car
SHEEEEEEEESH
Did you mean 2020 stingray charvolette? The engines are good just need a good shift while racing
What doesn’t make sense is why build a car with shitty quality parts
I have one.... in GTA V online
Beautiful and I want one.
I totally knew this about my c8 t
He is praising a Corvette, and doesn't even talk about the motor or handling. You missed the forest for the trees!
I’m watching this as if I’m not broke. Lol
Lol it’s not for going over bumps...it’s for landing off of a steep driveway my boy.
oh wow. how innovative.
Wow. That’s a beautiful car
I like how they don't even have any real sting ray colors. Pass.
"Welcome to TOTAL! DRAMA! ISLAND!"
That’s soooo cool I want one now
🔥🔥🔥
This is just my opinion...👀I don’t like the new corvettes
Omg I love this. I bet it cost a lot. I’ll look the cost up later
It only took them about 70 years to finally make a half decent corvette.
Like....why you got to make me jealous bro
Are they going to make them in right hand drive?
Don’t care to broke to afford one
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.   / / / /// / / / // / / / / ,  /.  .
All that and they still can't afford license plate brackets?  GM just can't get it right.
"Raises the front end so u dont hit bumps" hahaha raises what.. Like half and inch damn lame. Waste of money, rich snobs, f*ck off
Didnt think itd also have the GPS front end raise feature, quite handy
😍😍
It’s yellow so it’s a taxi. Thems the rules
I live where corvettes are made. Every once in a while, I drive over to the motorsports park and see tons of them in all different colors.
That is funky af 💛💙💜🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
What's cool about the car is that the average person will never own one :)
They fucking ruin the Corvette
Okay, now take my money
But why is this the instrumental to Princes Cuts by Headie One tho?
Yea cool 2 trunks but if u slam on the breaks in a turn ur gonna spin tf outt💀
Every time i see one of these new corvettes on the streets it makes me think of Jordan Schlansky. An America thinking he's European. And at times GTA5's cars as well.
It looks like a cheap Chinese copy of a ferrari 🥱🥱🥱
Oh yes coquette d10 in gta v
I love my new C8 best investment I’ve ever made and a damn fun car to drive 😂
Oh the timer wasn't meant for the highway...?
Is that the conquette D10😂😂😂
What doesn’t make sense is why you chose to not have the wing option
You sounded sarcastic the whole time😂
Looks like a Ferrari not a corvette
Track your lap times when you go to Walmart and back
New chev/gmc crap never gets old. Cuz its in the junk yard 50k miles down the road.
Why yellow
Things about the NeW cORvEtTe that just make sense: THE ENGINE IS PURE GARBAGE and so is the "ReViEwEr".    I like the exterior tho but it just looks like a race car now.
And my model 3 has more tech and is faster for 40k less. Lol
This one looks like a 458 tbh
Sick, not sure why but this car seems like a Corvette designed by Chevy but built by Mercedes Benz 🙄
🔥
It’s still just a Chevy. Waste of money.
I work at a GM car dealership and I can say the mid engine on that thing is a pain to work on
Let me just get my wallet. . . .
i can use this when im gonna be rich!!! oh wait *i will never be rich*
That's ugly af
Only $59,999 buy now
Liked the z06 but this mid engined is even better...  can be a nice 718 4.0 NA substitute, if you dont have much money... but for Italy (taxes based on co2, displacement and kW, better a porsche flat six. Less taxes, more luxury, engine screaming like a little yankee Ls/ LS3 killer 😎
Today I saw a man nearly run into a fence, on the opposite side of the road with his Corvette.
Lol the easing of the front I sent even enough for bumps or speed bumps… damn and there putting so much work into the sport and super cars that they don’t even think about me and us that like to off road al they did was make i pice of shit city/ town car called the blazer that can’t to or haul any thing not the the k5 square body would of been more useful to go back and keep reproducing k5 square body blazers… from 1970s….
not a stingray, C8
Waste of 100k
It also has an ejector seat( if the engine explodes)
wtf? why not put the engine in FRONT, where it's serviceable, and magically have ONE LARGE trunk instead of two tiny shoeboxes in the front and rear? I hate it btw
It's all fun and video games, until you actually drive one.  It's Garbage.
This is the best car ever manufactured in America, period
"Im going to show you things that I have that you don't cus I'm a d*ck." Fixed your title a$$hole
Bumblebee?
Took cheevy a while to copy porsche
Junk
Still don’t want one. Flashy gimmicks are a cover up for all its lacking. Meh…
IN TEN YEARS THE COMPANY WILL BE DEAD. ICE 🧊 COMPAINES WILL SOON BE OUT OF BUSINESS WITH TESLA TAKING OVER
And now show how dumb the passenger seat feels… you got a wall separating you from the driver
I'm sold I need a special color and I'm on my way down now...🤑
That trunk in the front is a Funk
There brand trying to become exotic cars really they trying to copy a Ferrari base model
This isn't a list of things that makes sense, it's just a guy rationalising some of the features.
That is a very nice car. All black would be 😫💦
used 911turbo 100k how much they want for corvette these days is retarded
The sleepy emery ultrastructurally bubble because basketball noticeably yell given a encouraging cat. crowded, simple shoemaker
"Because the engine is in the back, you get a trunk back there and up here" yes, welcome to mid engined cars, i can see its your first time here.
You get a trunk and a frunk, who'da thunk it 🤷‍♂️
Things that just make sense: This car has wheels
Still smaller than my 1 trunk tho
Congrats rich people
Yeah that’s an ugly front camera. Chevy always cuts corners where they can.
I'd hate to work on the engine from that spot
This is literally every super car it’s nice that Chevy finally made a true performance car but these features are standard
Not bad
Gonna love those weekly trips to the dealership every time a little tech gimmick fails
Feel like everyone knew everything he said in the video
They need to make an electric one.
I used to hate corvettes. But these new ones are super sick looking
Tesla:     *Hold my beer*
Paying 30 grand+ over sticker price for a c8? Now that doesn't make sense 😒
I'm getting that
It's the car in GTA online!
Pretty much everything you just mentioned was on the previous generation....
You forgot to mention that the rear trunk is the perfect size to fit a set of golf clubs. Cuz Corvette owners love to golf lol.
those features (except the mirror which is cool) existed in lots of other cars before this. sure you're getting a lot for 80k but it's a chevy, it will still break and still is made cheaply
The rear is so ugly tho
Looking like a ferrari 488gtb had a baby with a camaro.
Waste of cash tbh
I respect the waterbottle for scale on the bumperlift banana would be better tho
When you work at a dealership and you get to take nice cars back to your apartment building lmao. Like ima start making vids on people's houses. You don't need to own shit now days
Step one . Be rich
Number 1 that I have money
Nice but not a corvette
I love the 15inch wheels !
it's a cool looking car at a great price but the middle console / dashboard (whatever you call the place with all the buttons) just looks so weird
Sick il go order one on Amazon prime...................
Raises the front end 1 cm lol wtf was that
It’s great and all but it just looks so cheap and American
This car is lit, i would know, i have one lol
That’s cool and all but Gucci mane would ask if it came with a blunt in it
Why the hell dose this guy sound like the dude off of total drama island
Every "muscle car" started to look "hyper cars" now a days... I wouldn't mind a ride in one though
Why two small trunks when you can have one big trunk where bigger things can fit
The only thing I’d criticize is the first feature, with there being two trunks. I find it better to have one specific area where you can store everything, that way it’s bigger; thus, the capacity is larger.
So another words they put air ride on it. I love air ride when it works properly, but i absolutely hate it when you have to fix or replace it. The cost alone rivals the cost of the car!
Makes sense it’s ugly
I want one
the fact that i thought this was a koenigsegg really shows chevy clearly forgot what their corvettes look like
https://youtube.com/shorts/6WqtyoetCa0?feature=share
@stradman lol
*I remember when they first unveiled the starting price for the C8. My face went pale when they said under $60K.*
What is the name for this bb
Stingray: Raises half an inch   Car people: Woah
I'd wrestle a naked man inside it, I'll tell you that for free right now!
I like how the antenna is a stingray
Not my cup of tea but credit to chevy, as far as numbers and bells n whistles go, its got basically everything you want. I look forward to the day the Americans learn how to crack 100hp per L on a nasp engine but i guess with there fuel prices who cares?
Nice toy
Half the price of it's competition, along with half the aesthetic. 😏 I'm sorry, but anyone over 25 can see that this thing just screams "I'm a tool that thinks he's cool!" There's a certain elegance and flow that Chevy just doesn't have with their designs. Now, the classic Stingray -- I'll hand that one to them.
Mercedes did the front lifting in 2005!!!!!! All sbc cars have that
CHEVY, following Ford's footsteps since 1903 🤣
Raising the front to avoid scrapes when parking is the most attractive feature to me. Soooo thoughtful!
It’s ugly
Love this car
God these videos are made for people that dont even know what the fuck a car is.
Keep strong. Dont forget that despite the evil in this world, God is full of justice, mercy and love.   Justice said we broke His perfect law - causing the world's previous perfection to be destroyed - and therefore we deserve Hell (like a punishment in any legal system but this is eternal as His perfect law is eternal too). Don't think you fit in that category? Ever done one of these?: lying, stealing - regardless of how small the object EVER, hating others - which is murder in God's perfect law, lusting (plus God sees our entire thought life). Justice says "the soul that sins shall die" - if we break one in thought/word/deed it's as if we're guilty of all of them. Quite simply, living by the law (which is doing everything perfectly) is impossible for sinful humans   . The law shows us that 1. We will die in Hell if we fail to follow it and 2. We cannot save ourselves BUT, 3. God's perfect, immovable law points us to Christ, who followed and fulfilled the law in thought, word and deed perfectly in our place. He did what we couldn't and did it on our behalf. He was then sentenced to death on a cross, and took our personal punishment for our sin, paying our penalty (like paying our fine) completely FOR us, and has given us freedom.   If we turn from the sins we have committed and repent (pursue the opposite direction of love through Christ) He will, overtime, recreate us back into that previously perfect image through The Holy Spirit which Jesus sends to all who accept Him as their personal Lord and Savior of their life. It's not about following the law - perfectly, as it's impossible - it's about letting Christ in to guide and teach you and obeying Him through His power (not ourselves as it's impossible without depending on His power and instruction).   He is our substitute in His life, death and resurrection. He essentially rewrote history in our place so that, if you believe in Him, it will be as if you had never sinned if you accept Christ's death as our own in our place.   He is in Heaven right now preparing a place for us so that He can take His faithful, believing children home with Him when He returns. He will ressurrect us from death when He returns, giving mercy to those who accept His love, instruction and teachings in their life, and give justice to those who refuse it.   He doesn't want ANY of us to go to Hell and die for continuing in evil and rejecting His way to life, thats why He died FOR us. Hes giving EVERYONE a chance, He wants everyone to take the free gift of salvation from Hell. He wants us to be His and begin to follow His life of love and service through Him. So long as we keep our hearts near to Christ through His strength, strive to follow His will of perfect love revealed in the Bible, and ask Him to help us in the midst of (very certain) pitfalls and struggles, we will, in time, win the ultimate victory over sin, pain and DEATH through Christ. Even if you are willing to be made willing, pray for Jesus to come in and He will do what we can't. Give us The Holy Spirit who will guide us in the right way.  NOTE: You are NEVER too sinful or messed up that God cannot turn your life around through Jesus. EVER  If you have any questions let me know
Never liked corvettes especially newer models that look like a pontiac from behind....whats the deal about them, a big engine, big deal, so what they are no co.parison to European sports cars!!! Take that!
I hate these videos that are like ______ that just make sense like bruh stfu
Literally EVERY tesla ever😑
This video made me love this car even more.
Soooo rather than make a bare bones race car like chevy wants the corvette to be, they made a car that can be parked by morons safely.
Applaus. The germany inventions from 00 finally reached amurica...... Hahahahaha
“And it can be yours for $175,987.67, plus tax, title, and licensing. Hurry into your Central Kentucky Chevy Dealer today!”
I didn’t know about the feature to lift the front end, gotta say that’s pretty nifty
They are just making cars more and more for people who are incapable of driving. The ultimate genesis will be tesla when it just drives for you then we will all be like the fat guys in Wall E
Jeez, they made the car completely inoperable, unless you push every button inside of the dash. Car can't get over a speed bump? push button. Can't see out of tiny little rear windshield? Push button (s). Can't see in front of you for some reason? There's a button for that, as well.
This car is an imposter
Yet another Garbage Motors manufactured chevy junkvette?Yeah, I'll take a hard pass on that trash...
This car is just hideous! Looks like a camaro rear end on vette front end. The interior is ridiculous with a million buttons every where
Tesla is better
My mans just kinda pointed out the obvious😂😂
This fucking kid thinks that the car raises and lowers because of bumps, that's adorable 😂😂😂😂  Bruh, it raises and lowers because it's capable of going over 200 miles per hour, lowering the nose gives you more stability at that speed
Which Corvette? This isnt that fake Ferrari?
Edit this video and blur the license plate
That’s awesome
That's not a corvette in my opinion.
So basically just has a bunch of features other car manufacturers have been using for years?
Tesla model Y needs that rear view camera.
Also! It will store 1000 location were you use the Front End lift!
I want it
That is smoking! Wow! My favorite car
To me the C8 corvette based model still has the same problem as all the previous models which is the car looks way too narrow in person. That big ass on the c8 looks so nice in photos but in person the front and rear quarter fenders are way too narrow.
I like the auto raise feature
Ain’t gonna lie I’ll get that car
They can say what they want about this car. But it surely is one of Chevy's best hits so far and I am so happy for them.
Looks like a mini lambo
And $100,000 later
I don’t like corvettes but for the price you get a lot
My dad haves one im 19
What rich guy shit is this?
sweet
But is it electric tho ⚡️
It's always 'Makes sense' but never 'Makes dollars' 😔
Walmart McLaren. Walmart is pretty cool...
I still think if you gon drop 100k ona car a r35 is the way I mean cmon take off will quick on some1
Starting to like this car.
Beautiful car but the interior design is just not for me.
And it has an electrical system that two days after leaving the dealership will go haywire and you'll spend the next three months with a rental......
No way this is 70k
Im buying this shit bro
Bro Corvettes are such a steal. Hopefully they still are so I can buy one when I older
Best car ever made would definitely buy it
So it has bags thats sick
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Junk
It looks like it's trying really hard to be a Ferrari or lambo. Corvettes used to have their own identity. This looks very generic.
OMG.Corvette has always been my dream car ❤❤❤❤👍👍👍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Eeew, Chevy🤮
Pretty sure I have this car in gta
I swear these videos are just do people can flex their fancy cars
I would love to drive this car. I've liked corvettes since I was a kid
he says:… “and raises the front”raises half a inch  But I’m not Hating I’m just saying I wish it raised up a little more
I love jdm but this is the best bang for your buck within this category. They did a good job with this car omg. And I know it's a fact because I hate most american cars 😂
Lol design problem looking at rear view mirror, they add a camera and a $1000 rearview mirror so you can see better... "Cool camera" no, it's a engineering issue with a costly solution.
My favorite car be like:
About they are made in place most dont know about. My hometown bowling green ky. ;)
Alot of nice bells and whistles    But I want to know how reliable it is
Looks awesome! And looks exactly like a Mclaren.
Dream car
I always think that these videos are going to be sarcasm because of the way he says “things that just make sense”
So they dont make sense. The rearview camera was the only thing that made sense. Only non driven mfs curb their shit.
My traverse has those same features
Its not available in an electric version yet.
The kingdom of heaven is coming to earth millennial reign 1000 years repent to see it  Be born again invite Jesus into your heart he values and accepts you
Cameras on cars do not make sense,  it encourages stupid people to drive, if a person can not park without a camera ,they have no business behind the wheel.
That’s a beautiful design
Ok i got it  you're rich
I might be the only one asking themselves... Why there's a 500ml water bottle infront of the car??? 🤔
Well done on stealing the mclaron design ,, very original but never as good 👍🏻
Got the body of a Mclaren i say but very beautiful Oustanding Chevrolet
The foregoing boot demographically pause because break tellingly retire around a parsimonious step-brother. red, bitter gemini
Corvette Aventador
So basically stock on bags, incredible
What Corvette stingray is this what model I mean
I will never in my life consider this a Corvette. It looks cool don't get me wrong, but has lost all the things that made it a Corvette. It's supposed to look like an American muscle car because that's what it's supposed to be. Instead it has a very European look to it and it's been tuned like a European car. They got rid of manual transmission which many manufacturers are doing now because my generation (teens & 20's) are a bunch of losers who only buy muscle cars for the looks and not for the enjoyment of a stick shift. All in all the whole car shouldn't be considered a Corvette.
Its called air suspension
Tbh it's really cool like for real but all these gadgets in the long run would they work the same
Should be called "How chevy put 10 year old tech in their new car". 🤣
Looks cool and all but it's American Ferrari.
TESLA!!!!
ok the rear veiw mirror thing is actually cool
Okay sure but it's still a chevy
Stupidest Vette ever
Ugliest car ever made in humankind history no wonder it comes from the us
Meh I'm leaving GM after 3 years. General motors has a huge problem with their inability to provide local dealerships with parts replacements. You can't make money as a technician if the most common and most basic automotive repairs or 3 weeks to 6+ months out of inventory. I've actually accumulated roughly $5,000 worth of debt to keep myself afloat while working for GM lol and I'm not even considering 2020  and the shut downs
Pretty sure we just evolved 5000 years to the future
Why are they always copying taillights design car industry in general
Wow ! At least one good youtube shorts video . I keep founding tiktok shits .
I'm not quit sure what to make of this car? It says corvette but, well hell I don't know.
But is it electric? No? Ok, pass.
Thats the same car from gta online
I'm driving a fiat
"What's cool is because the engine is in the MIDDLE, you get a trunk back here *AND* up here."  Every other mid-engined car ever:
I find this car very fucking ugly
Built in gap cam
Corvettes are not the only one with the camera rear view mirror.
Vertical video fail 👎
Anyway, this is not a Corvette, it is a Chevrolet with a Ferrari formula.
Hope mahk never sees this
Yea its all fun and games until you gotta do a tune up on it or something
2 extremely small trunks, which, when combined, give you one a very small trunk! Amazing innovation
It is glorious
How the hell do you put an engine in the middle
Free bags
It's a disgrace to the old 60s sting rays
Psssshhhh what a waste......
Thats nice, adding features to an expensive car that all the cheap cars already have. My Toyota doesn't need a button to have a back up and rear view camera, its already there.
I want oneeeee😭😭😭
Nice can't wait to get mine
Wow, a trunk and a frunk   JUST MAKE SENSE BRO
Having the engine right underneath my ass, and the ass of my passenger just seems dangerous to me. I mean I’m pretty old skool @this point, & I have very little faith in technology and well I’m sure this car is meant for speed...... Speed is deadly dangerous in the hands of the novice...
Incredible
I have 90% of that on my Buick
D10
Im getting one
Still can’t beat the 1966 stingray
Love that Rearview mirror and that Slick Body.
I want one I just don't want the 800 a month payment plus insurance but yes very neat car.
Nice Coquette D10 dude
would rather get a tesla
Wow, I’m speechless.
So if the engine is in the middle then why are we sitting in the middle
That's my dream car right there
Chevy has lost its touch
So in other words they looked at the way Europeans make cars and copied them as usual 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cool now I just need money 🤣
None of this is remotely unique to the corvette, say for the lap recorder.
I've never really been a Corvette fan but this one looks super sweet
So a car that looks good and has helpful features where can I get one?
It's just ugly
Or you could buy the new Tesla and get way more performance, safety, reliability, and cost savings annually. I honestly don’t know why people now a days should buy that car this only fits 2
this is an #ad
And it’s only 10 million dollars!
Sick
With you until u said track laptimes...that is useless on track...way too much understeer...built more for comfort than sportiness...that diff needs to be reconfigured then i will love it...other than that its useless i'm sorry... i thought i would love this car but hella dissapointed
Im a Ford Mustang guy till I die but have had a spot in my heart for the stingrays & they are soo nice
Seems like stuff European sports cars companies have been doing for years
But does it come in stick/manual?
The features are worthless when it's stranded on the side of the road like a typical chevy
Why you need all them cameras?? Can’t you drive a damn car
Flexing much?
My Lamborghini doesn't have these features 🤔
Is it road legal in the UK?
You can actually customize your class in game like COD
It's Ugly
Nextime try the mirrors they work better then a backup camera
The older one still looks better to me at least
The engine part doesn’t make sense cuz I wanna see the engine 😭
That is so cool
So.. it's a car for people that don't know how to drive made by people that don't know how to make a car..
It's lovely, but they make cars too low to the ground these days.  I want my ride pretty high up off the ground.
Elon musk: Hold my dodge coin
Gta
I can't believe it's less than 60K for all of this.
Ford is better
Everything Europeans have had on cars for 10+ years 😭😭
Why the trunk being in the middle doesn’t make sense, if the car got into a crash and broke a part of the engine it could ignite in flames almost instantly, burning everyone inside until they are roasted like a marshmallow.
And also the top comes off
Need a review from Mahk!!
a trunk in the front and in the back and there’s still no room! amazing
Tesla is faster, cheaper and better than this crap.
What doesn't make sense...is yellow!
Anyone wanna lend me 85 grand? I'm good for it, I swear!
It’s still a Chevrolet
I appreciate the water bottle used as a reference for the lift. Smart!
i just wamt the trans axel lol
Ahhh Americans finally catching up
If you're worried about curbing. You probably shouldn't be driving at all.
Nice car
One thing that doesn't make sense is the color lol
Man I want one Asap
Looks like GTA car
Imagine needing a feature to raise your car so that it works. Lmao
So it’s electric
Good car. Absolute bang for the buck kind
Walmart Lamborghini
Bruh I saw that same car like a week ago😂
Not usually a fan of american cars but this is actually a really good looking motor
Where's the engine 🚒🚒🚒🚒🚒🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂?
Bruh, that house in the background when he flips the rear view mirror, like whoa.
Looks like a hot wheels car a knockoff Lamborghini
I like corvettes but this is the only one I’m desperate for. Gimmie gimmie gimmie
30cm Latin american bumbs: ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
It looks like the smashed 5 cars together
Just looks like they stole bits off all other cars from round the world
Daaaaamn
My man has 2 trunks where both of them can’t fit more then 1 shopping bag
WHY YOU SHOW YPUR PLATE NUMBER
Is there even engine access? Like to someone who isn't a mechanic?
I want one !
That car is do ugly.
honestly stupid ass car cuz the new camaro has the same back lights so i just always think of it as a camaro, chevy did really sloppy with that
Only thing would have made it hotter if it war red or black
Well, the rear mirror camera is very helpful on those cars, the front bumper cameras too for parallell parking, the lift for bumps is really helpful if you live outside of the USA, the lap mode isn't for normal car drive, but its okay too
American made
Well let's just hope that engine don't explode or catch fire.....pants on fire if you ain't blown into oblivion
Well all MR2s have a trunk in the rear and the front sooooo nothing new to people that no a thing or two about cars
Everyone get this before we get a cocky tik tocker going , corvette corvette
I'm a chevy guy inside and out and I can't stand the new corvette  its so ugly  why would they  copy the Ferrari
Lambos already had  that shit
First corvette since the 60s that actually looks good!!!!
Too bad its ugly has that lotus look going
Looks very like a Ferrari.
Ok this car look much better than most ferrari and lamborghini
To much! Give me a gas peddle and brake from the 60s
God I wish I was rich
corvette trying to copy mclaren designs
An engine in the middle of a car basically means that if something happens to the car, and it maybe catches on fire, or is about to explode, that's your life
How did the manage to take a the character and charm out of the 69 stingray. like the 69 is such a nice looking car but this just look like you basic expensive car
Is this the 2021?
Corvette with a rear engine? This is no Corvette anymore.its a cheap american ripoff from european supercars. Too bad,i loved the old Corvettes because of the somewhat retro inspired Design and the big Block in the Front.
I’ve actuallly seen that exact car with that color in my neighborhood and I think it’s u lol
It has a nice Ferrari vibe to it very beautiful car
So it basically has the same technology as the 94 3000gt vr4ok
Wow all those cool gadgets but still encapsulated in plastic
Lol. Man. I’m a true car guy. So I’ll swallow my pride and say I hope all the vett fans who actually wanted this mid engine move to happen, are happy. Truly. Me on the other hand. That’s not a vett anymore. The American front engine V8 RWD Corvette that would surprise you on the strip, and the track is gone. We know this will be a good track car now. The straight line burning rubber champ is gone. They left it for the other brands. And I respect all cars. And builds. And manufacturers. But I loved saying Chevy had the best muscle car on the market to buy. They don’t anymore. The 2010 ZR1 was the last of the dying breed. Respect to anyone who owns the new vett. It’s a great car. With great features. And it’s really not that bad of a price. I’m excited to see the reactions of you all when they show what else they’ve been doing. It’s already becoming a international track car. Props to Chevy for stepping away from there comfort zone. Don’t let me down.
Ayayay it’s in yellow, best color for a muscle or super car, draws the most attention love it bro keep up the cool Vids
Soo happy this looks like a Corvette and not something like a hatchback and a 'vette had a baby 🤣👍
I tried to purchase one last week,  at the end of the transaction,  they charged me another $15,000. I'm getting the Lexus LC after that bs stunt! 😤
It just looks like any super car. Its boring
Things about a car I'll probably never own.
Today on total drama island
Hopefully  that wasn't his actual license plate
"-YOU- get a truck in the back and in the front." Me:🙉
*Cost?*
Chevy cars are awesome. We already miss GM in India.
Only problem is you have to be under 6ft to even attempt to fit in this car
Stupid driver needs this desperately.  Mainly USA ordinary drivers 🙄
He is the car guy everyone talks about...
Is bumble bee going to get this Chevrolet transformation to the next part of transformer?😎😎
This proves why the C8 will forever be my favourite 'Vette
Oh look mom! A budget lamborghini!
Illegal street racing just advanced to level 2😳😳😳😂😂😂
Lol my Ford gt has that
American cars are a joke
worth EVERY PENNY ....
Wait but it the engines in the middle how do you work on it
Stop biting ferrarri corv!
Wow 👏 😮 👏
All of those features have no use when your car breaks down after a few kilometers.
Price 100 million
This car has every normal feature a Toyota or Honda has. I’m not making fun of sport cards but corvets are trash in the game. America car sucks and most mechanics don’t work on engines in the middle of the car.  I really like to review cars. It’s sad to see a new gtr worth 100k feels like cheap plastic when you sit in it. Like have you felt the material? It’s all hard cheap plastic and it’s a 100k car. Choose wisely people not everyday can speed in a car forever.
Bad design requires great solutions
All I hear is "Corvette drivers can't drive"
Not the colour tho😂
Plot twist: the rearview mirror camera is so you can send people to gapplebees and watch it in 4K😎
Set it on my list to buy because holy fuck
two trunks?! wow now you can store two bodi- I mean more groceries!
Looks like gta’s d10
But it’s a chevy
The rear trunk is not actually a trunk, it's the holding compartment for the roof that comes off.
The only thing that is bad is that you have to drive a certain amount of miles before you can unlock the full speed
Ive got a car just like that, except it came in a box and I have to glue the pieces together 😁
How do you top up the engine oil and coolant and all of the other lubricants? Kinda bad engineering if you ask me just to try have more storage space
You paying for these you idiot. Of course  has to make sense
Yuck
Wow only half a million not bad, let me just see how much money I have in my account.  Bank account: $12.93  Me: 🤔 I got enough for the down payment
I want that
tesla: thats cute !!
Chevy is known for recall after recall for the money id rather have a new GT500
This is actually such and ugly car that will age terribly.. C7 is so much nicer
Sexy
Lol. Old man car.
Audi had the lift feature on their A4 like 14-15 years ago?  It was for snow, but still. I'm surprised this is "something new" for a car series that sits so low.
Let's be honest: this is just for him to show off his car
The front be bagged
Stfu. Tiktok toxic af
Crazy car I’m so glad I got one while I could
Wanna be Ferrari
alright let me go acquire one with a handful of dust
Camera on the back is actually really smart idea
HOLLY SHIT THEY MADE A 30303333 CAR
Hate those rims
Make money money make money money monaaaay 💕🎉🎉
Yeah!  Those trunks spaces make sense 🤣
SAYS THIS IS NOT A BACKUP CAMERA.  THEN LITERALLY SAYS IT IS A CAMERA THAT FACES THE REAR❗
Of course it is make  Sense because is not a mistake like you      Just a joke
If it's not electric then it's just doesn't make sense
Are you speaking from a cave?
Two trunks?.... more like 2 more glove compartments. 🤣🤣
That air suspension dont work in Alberta🤣🤣
Everything you mentioned here apart from the frunk and trunk do not come standard with these cars, all are options.
That car is just completely sick no matter what anybody says that car is f****** awesome
And all these things have a lifespan of only a few years. Dealerships are gonna love these for repair costs.
I want this car
Okay I actually like these features.
Best car in the world
We live in Texas f*** that little car
So this isn’t about gimmicks we would never use?
But can I afford it ... Well probably if I were to quit using heroin hahahah jk I still couldn't afford it
This video should be called: Things In Every 2021 Sports Cars
I think I'm more content with the Kia stinger! Only amenities and at an affordable rate also hybrid 😁
I got that in gta
Shit car
Ain't nobody give a shit about a corvette. That shit is played out. Only for old men and young youtubers trying to show off monies....
Wish they put the suicide doors
Eso ya no es un Corvette parece un Ferrari tiene mucho de copia los chinos son los que copian mal para GM.
Bruh lambo doesn’t even have this
I wish I can afford something like that I worked hard all my life but Pittsburgh PA doesn’t have too many opportunities
Yay a car that's extremely hard to work on
One badass Vette ❤️
I like this car but everyone used to hate the stingrays
These features should be standard on every car auto industry be scamming minimal upgrades outrageous prices
Princess cuts remix 🤣🔥
A corvette is just a Chevrolet 😂😂😂
That car is ugly Poor man’s Lambo!!!
I mean the camera for the rear view doesnt really make sense... just design the car so you can see out of it...
Wow those are some big brain moves
Just too much to deal with, give me a Range Rover please
Not to mention the big scratch on the hood
Goodjob. I was wondering how people was able to see out the narrow window now a way better feature added will help alot. These are so cool
The first one is literally a feature of all mid engine mounted coupes. Land Rover figured out the rear view camera thing years ago. Bumper raising thing isnt new, Tesla figured that out ( even have your gps remember it) and if the track performance monitoring wasn't included, I'd be surprised considering the car we're looking at.  Nothing earth shattering people, move on. Its all been done before and done better.
Yeah I've played gta 🙄🙄
And that's it?
"new" it's been out for a while
Man who else thought the front camera had a broken screen
Chevy needs to remake the vette like the 2nd gen corvette  that’s how a vette should look
John 3:16-18  Jesus loves you  Jesus is coming back very soon. Hell is real, hell wasn't made for humans but for fallen angels but if you reject Jesus and his sacrifice you will end up in hell. Whoever you worship on earth is who you will worship in the afterlife. Repent before it is too late. Please i plead with you for the sake of God.
Im actually buying it just for those features, cool!
Instead of calling it a Stingray....it should of been called Zora.
Useful features, but first you have to get a car that costs 100k to get them.
comes with stock bags lol
But why does it look so ugly?
For once someone who says _____ that just makes sense and has enough sense to follow it up with reasons and not just stupid shit
That’s car look pretty nice
Yooooo it's a challenger cobra 392
That’s actually really cool
Never thought id say that but, i think the c8 corvette is genuinly one of the best bang-for-buck cars you can get today. Ive long been an oldschool jdm/new euro guy and while i found the corvettes, mustangs, camaros and whatnot to be nice and all, they just never really appealed to me  Until i drove a c8 recently. I dont even care about the power, sure its fun but thats just straight line performance, that you get with basically everything today  If it had 400hp less and the same suspension, itd still be a fucking blast through the mountains because of the amazing setup considering the price Its actually insane.
Btw most of the features are extra you have to pay for
Man is just flexing, he knows nobody needs this information.
ANNNNND the best part… they start @$60k!!
Thts dope asf
I'm just not a Corvette guy. And don't bother making hateful comments  at me  for that opinion, it too over the top for me. It's alot like Harley Davidson  riders who put loud speakers on their  motorcycle's,  however,  that rear view mirror camera is an  amazing idea.
C8 is the new ferrari
I want one so bad 😟 but covid made me poor
the car barely raised up when he pressed the button
As a huge Ford guy, I love this car
Instead of designing al those camera systems they should have designed a car that is safe to drive with a safe view around you through your windows and mirrors.
Still no manual transmission?
Wife and I both have C06z's. We drove a C8 and both decided not to get one. No manual tranny and too much computer controlled crap. They're already having software glitches, leaking lift pumps and trans failures. And as anyone who has owned a C6 or C7 can tell you; Chevrolet customer service is a sick joke...clutch problems, bad valve guides and dropped valves... JMPO
Is the new c8 mid-engine
Ok but both the front and back storage is tiny so it kinda negates having two in the first place
👁👄👁
All the features are to fix floors that normal cars don’t have
Every one of these features are grabbed from other cars
Finally.. just a normal video without annoying music in the background
I thought Ferrari was collaborating with Chevy to help build the new Corvette. It seems that Ferrari built the Corvette and just let Chevy claim that they did.
Sounds like the total drama island guy
Rear end looks like a camaro
Americans discovering features that euro sports cars and supercars have had forever
Raises up about 5cm 😂
Very European
Engine in the middle seems like it would be impossible to work on
Ooo good to know...
Cobra vs. Stingray that already happened lets do it again
Yeah, mid engine cars usually have two trunks
FORD
Eye candy 🍬😋😍
all i heard was money. money money.... and more money. and then at the end. money i dont have
Alright, that mirror bit caught me off guard 😂
Come on Dogecoin double so I can buy one
💞💞💞👌🇺🇸💪
Nice a cheap Ferrari.
I think this is the only Short that was worth watching
Nice you're trunk equals half the size of a normal trunk 🔥
Lap times in the front loop picking up your kids
He sounds like the host of Total Drama Island
Flight would know
Can do all of that to any car for less than R45k
If your that into cameras you should have bought one.
I still prefer the c7. 🖖🏻
I just fell in love with it
Nice real nice
Front McLaren or Ferrari Back Lamborghini
But what if someone was blinding u with headlights while driving how would u darken ur mirror or would it jus automatically darken it self
Car guys see a yellow sports car and immediately know all the features I see a yellow sports car and immediately think of Bumblebee from Transformers
That interior looks like its from the 80s.  Tesla Plaid S will destroy this car on most levels.
Well congrats you paid 80k or more for a car that does 15mpg but hey if you got the money for a Corvette you sure have the money for gas 😂😂
Hm this Corvette looks cheaper than it actually is.
I really dont understand why people hate the c8, I love it, such a nice car, thats my opinion tho.  Corvettes are pretty cars and kinda affordable than getting a Lamborghini lol
Imagine being in a tractor trailer n not seeing that low car sittin front?😅😬
If I buy a car like that then every thing should make sense
It's an ugly car it's overhyped and i would much rather buy a nissan r35 gtr then buy this piece of junk
This car makes life easier as far as everything is concerned except for the fuel, if you win this car especially if you are broke you won't drive it for too long. You will sell it because of how much fuel it consumes
What a cool car
Corvette😋
Imagine needing multiple buttons just to park the car lol these new gens man
these are literally all features an aventador or a huracan has, but cheaper. the new corvette IS a supercar
Thats fckin coqeutte d10 on gta
and to think they make these in *Kentucky* I have seen a man eat possum he hit on the way home from work and they make these Lambo killers like 45 minutes away.
The thing is, I’d always forget I have those things so I’ll just stick with my old fusion
This is just a way to flexing their car.
Ngl I thought there was a swastika on the ground
It's ugly, sounds shitty and looks cheap. C7 hands down.
Raises it 0.00001 micrometers
Amazing
They  could have done a car what not look like a Ferrari and McLaren and Lambo and a Zonda
Looks shit
✍️win✍️the✍️lottery✍️then✍️buy✍️expensive✍️car✍️
I need a monkey green one cause it's bananas!
i own this car in The Crew 2. it’s free and it’s ight
Sheeeesh
Why do they put Chevy emblems on Ferrari?
Just like an Tesla but a Tesla is electric
I'll.. curve your front end >:)
weird flex
USA USA
They finally made a corvette that looks nice
Law of attaction 👌👌
A water bottle for scale
Trunk in the back, trunk in the front, and a finely tuned bomb riiiiight beneath ya.
Built in gapple bees cam
Cool you gotta a fast and new car  My dream car is still a excursion
is it bussin tho
Cool other than it being yellow
I have a sting ray too but it’s a 1977 one
Another car reviewer who knows more about journalism than cars or how to actually drive them.
Cadillac came up with all of those 3 years ago
The z06 will be cool. These base models with the narrow rear and rear wheels don't do it for me. I have an 18 GS and the difference in the look of the c7 GS/z06 compared to the stingray is huge.  I would never own a stingray of any generation.
And when you over heat the engine you get burned on your neck,back and ass!
U sound faker then my ex
Rich problem: I cant decide which trunk to put my sack of groceries in
Also it can drift nice coz it's mid engine
I see a guy flexing his money
Mid engine, the doors should open up and forward.  The worst part about a vette is it's hard to get in or out if you can't open the door all the way.  And they're wanting it to not be a vette anymore, so why not go all the way?
I hate how it sits in the back it needs to be lowered but I have no idea what that would do to a mid engine car I've had ls1 trans ams all my life
Glad atleast Chevy has brains than other supercar brands to have ground clearance.
I thought that was the hensey car from forza 2
Check out til testing one straight from gm plant its amazing how much doesn't work
Things that don’t make sense:  That Color 🤢
Wtf they give you air suspension from factory 😳
I see these videos and I can't believe how much cars have evolved, and the fact that I don't like new cars because older cars look so much better just shocks me on how cars now are just too futuristic compared to cars from the 1950's or even before that
Corvettes are so underrated... Everybody talks about Lambos and Ferraris
Man what a hideous vehicle
Jeezam pees...
Don’t like it
I want one in all black with red trim
I want one! Does kind of remind me of like a Lamborghini
Now everyone’s gonna become fans of corvettes all of a sudden
It has the same lines as a Ferrari
Might be my next car😏
Found my new dream car ill be right back
The only thing that doesn’t make sense is that shape… kind of like they smashed a lambo and Camaro together and called it the GTAV special…
I traded my c8 for a diesel denali 2500 hd
Cool car but it doesn’t look much like a corvette anymore :(
corvette: midlife crisis edition.
This is my dream car.
waaaoowww actually awesome
Hahahah lap times… 99.9% of the people(old dudes) that buy this will never take it to the track.  If you’re not first… you’re last
Very interesting.
It looks like it a hick trying to look Italian
My my has the Corvette gone from a sports car that everyone could own to a wannabe supercar that almost no one can own.
All these cameras everywhere dont bode well for our future...
Chevrolet finally achieved their goal of making a Ferrari....smfh
i always prefer corvette over mainstream luxury because it's just better and cheaper end of the line
Looks like a Lamborghini
Isn’t that a corvette c8-
My pop drove Chevys until he died.
looks like a walmart mclaren
Can't way to speedrun getting back home from work
Everything makes sense.... Except that color!!! Not saying I don't like yellow on a car... just not THAT yellow.
Looks like a reasonably priced ferarri
I read it as chewy corvette lol
Ma uncle got dat car
Dude he talkes like one of those "5 most amazing thing about _____" people so annoying
60 gs baby or more
Things that make sense: Majority of Chevy's being manufactured in Mexico and not America. 🤷‍♂️
Why is this car so ugly 😭 it doesn't look like Corvette
This is more of General Motors garbage is nothing but junk because that's all General Motors can build
I ripped my big toenail off last night.
Mawk comes into the scene "So you're gonna pay me 50$ to be in this chevy commercial"
Thats the coquette d10
That rear trunks for the roof
this is the car you get when you wanna drive a supercar car, but can’t actually afford a supercar😭
Ford GT would be my pick
Last one I saw it was just a flex but these actually make sense lol
Forgot that the car is 95% plastic 😂😂
I really don’t understand the appeal of an overpriced toy like this.
Should have said, things other manufacturers have done, that Chevrolet just noticed and implemented... 😂
Plastic, much more placating, us cars
“Raises the front end!” Car “raises” to an indescribable amount
So when the engine blows up for some reason the passages blows up as well
Awww look at chevy catching up with the rest of the world
Hammond you sodding tic tac this was my lambo chevvy
This technology is nothing new
Having a trunk in the front of the car can actually be bad because if you get into a head-on collision the engine wont be there to stop you and take in the impact making it more dangerous. (However having one Is pretty cool)
I don't like Chevrolet, mainly because i live in Europe and the Chevys here are garbage (there is a huge difference between American and European Chevys). But I'm actually very very impressed by this Chevy.
It’s funny watching these guys try justify there moneys worth in the biggest shitbox engine if it didn’t have a ls9 engine it would be the most overpriced piece of poo to every come out of General Motors
Still just a GM plastic bag with wheels
This whole car doesn’t make sense wnen is no longer a corvette, but just in name
Finally, Someone who cares about the actual practical questions. And doesn’t just buy the car cause it looks cool.
Needing two cameras so you don’t hit something means you designed it wrong.
Looks like a car from GTA .
That's awesome I'm gonna run out and get one right now. Where do you store yours?
Sheeesh thats thicc bro.i love it
It’s also comes with 16 fake air vents 😂
Wow
Song name?
That color doesn't Make sense. Yuck
My son bought a 2000 C5 Corvette with 56k miles and it was a piece of garbage shame on GM Chevy engineers.
Nice engine in the background... Nice ass pump station generator
American trash car Plastic fantastic
Never going to get this car, but at least this one wasn't just a pointless flex. I actually found myself getting excited for some that I wish my car had.
This obviously is the top of line C8 I’ve seen some with literally the dash and a radio
Noting about the corvette makes sense, all upu see is middle aged men so fukin proud of their fake ass ferrari 🤣🤣🤣🤡🤡🤡
This makes me want the stingray more
Well thats fucking cool
I always did not like chevy but this car right here is something else
You see. This is a car that an inexperienced driver might enjoy
what doesnt make sense on this car is how high the rear fender is compared to the wheel, makes the rims look tiny, and throws off the entire proportion.
How much?
It would make more sense if they put a bigger rearview mirror from the beginning so they don’t have to do the camera thing or vice versa! They should’ve used that button as a eject button and that would’ve been cooler since the car look like a fighter 🛩! 😂
things about the new chevrolet corvette stingray that just makes sense:  it has a steering while that if you move left or right, the front wheels move accordingly.   speaking of front wheels, there are four wheels situated at each corner of the car to help the car move smoothly.   this huge piece of glass in front, it’s there so you can see where you’re going!
Hey Volkswagen shoe chevy where to chove it
I like this corvette
OMG IT LOOKS AMAZING!!! 😃😃😃
Ugly ass car
Nice to see a luxury sports car dealing with blind spots and other holdbacks
Still an American car tho. Looks great but still pass
my chevy c10 has manual roll down windows🤷🏼‍♂️...nah but seriously i love chevy, they did an amazing job with this one right here👍🏻
The old corvette had one truck and a whole lot more room. Had a normal mirror that rear window that you can see perfectly out of
Because it's a lot of old people buying this car.
The itself dont make sense
My dad has been waiting 3 months for this car to arrive, and it finally had just last night, I was so happy
Pos
The success of the C8 proves how superior mid-engine is, ofc not to mention these features + more which are seemingly so basic to me that it's a no brainer that the car would have them. Although for what it's priced at, they're considered a luxury.
How much
Wow, an expensive car that’s actually practical
Looks nothing like a American muscle car, not that I'm complaining
I had to count from 6 to know which corvette this is
Total lambo rip off...
I used to hate corvettes but they nailed the new ones
I love Corvette's, always have. Wish Ford would've kept up the comp with the GT. $
unfortunately it just isn't the same as a European car 😢
But wait.. all of these features are available on a Toyota 😏 (Rav4 in my example)
Corvette needs to take back their title of king of the road.
When a Tesla can gap that
Lmao americans are so behind with the technology
Wow... Actually impressed with a new cars gadgets for once 🤣
The camera on the back is SO essential... all cars should have that on the stock mode
These features are better on a family car like a bmw suv or a mercedes suv
Wtf I think I saw that car before I saw by a Walmart
I want that car so bad. *it looks sick*
You mean coquette D10 right?
Here come the Corvette haters they're only haters because they can afford one or fit in it.
None of this was exciting or revolutionary.
Basic stuff. My moms toyota has these except the hydro lift but thats unnecessary
Gay
Looks like shit🤢🤮
I would never afford one
So when will the corvette actually look like a corvette again instead of a knock off lambo?
Garbage 🗑️
So what if the engine is in the middle it's a really cool car so stop hating on it.
That looks European as fuck
I hate this reel
So basically it's a car that has features to compensate for its design flaws, nice
Feature that makes sencs..... i had round wheel so they turn easier
Fords done that for a while *yawn*
Want, too expensive in the UK though
Man I've always loved Corvettes they've always been my dreams cars but Damm this is gets me wet
I can't believe that thing is only worth $60,000, it's so much nicer than the Ferraris I've been seeing lately.
Nice
I just see reasons to not buy a corvette.
Who the fuck gonna be racing a stingray?
Yea we just have 100-200k just laying around waiting for for a vet.
When I was younger...in my early 20's... I knew an older woman who was very beautiful,  smart and outspoken.  She told me that most women see a car like this or big ridiculous truck and immediately know that man usually has a small pickle.  Is this true ladies?
It looks life a mf block of cheese
Yellow makes 0 sense
This really brings up the chauvinist in Americans lol. Don't get me wrong, it's great to be proud of your country and nationality. But it's not like any of you has anything to do with the design of this car or most of the content on social media that trigger that chauvinist soft spot...
Unfortunately it is an American attempt at a sports car. That means the following:  1. It's a loud garrishly ugly price of crap.  2. It will fall apart at the speed of light and cost a fortune to maintain  in a running condition as soon as you drive it off the lot.  3. It will have a massive engine that had the same power to weight ratio as an elephant because US engine tech is such crap. Why innovate when we can just make it bigger and use a ton more fuel!  4. It is vastly overpriced.  5. It will drive like a brick.  6. You will need a visit to a chiropractor after 15 minutes of driving it.  7. The lack of visibility out of the thing will mean you will bang it up or wreck it almost as soon as you buy it.  8. Being it is a US attempt at a sports car, there is a 98% chance it is being driven by a hot headed idiot with an IQ about the same as his shoe size who will probably use it to wreck some perfectly sensible car doing a burn out within a month of buying it.
It's cool and all but its probably millions of dollars
Front camera? Now gamers that play racing games with the camera set to the front can finally buy a car with their favourite camera mode.
Now good sir I'm gonna say 5 words HOW MUCH FOR THE CAR
Is sum like a batman car🤣
Bro you talking like you’re sponsored
Shit car
This guy: Presses button Me: Did it even come a inch?
Adjustable suspension and rear cameras! Wow, this thing will be the best selling car of the 90s.
Does anybody else see the resemblance between this car and Ferrari just the body work
My guess is all those features will be broken in 5 years.
Is that front camera broken or something what am I looking at lol
Sooo, basically it's got the basics for any high end sports car. Silly Americans thinking they can make a thing. 🤭
I like how he said it was his car but it had test drive plates lmao
Laughs with middle engine drive toyota mr2
So things that European supercars have had for the past ten years?
Poor man's Ferrari...
It can also tell you your 0-60 time!
Things that makes sense… So it’s all electric with good range? It will be able to drive itself in the near future with an over the air update? Or just get better features/range whatever with over the air updates for free? It’s the One of the worlds safest cars? It has some kind of infotainment on it?   Really I don’t know I am asking. I’m guessing that the answer is no but I haven’t researched the car.
This is pathetic, zero creativity. Let's just rip off the Italians because American car design went down the shitter years ago.
so it has a built bags? that’s kinda cool. I just saw a red one earlier and it broke my neck
No way they used bags for what bags are meant for 🤯
Man i thought this was gta for a sec..look like the D10 lol
Chevy ripped off Ferrari
Can you use a less sarcastic phrase? Plz ... I thought I was gonna hear you trash the car 🤣   Well to my taste ya did actually. Those aren't features, those buttons are the duct tape of design flaws
So on today's, "You will never afford this!" We have this car here
The C8 is bad! They need to make an all wheel drive version! Maybe a hybrid twin turbo diesel version as well. Basically then need to make it into an American R8 since they're abandoning their legacy of being a RWD sports coupe.
More features more problems down the road.
If only my bank account wasn't empty heh
Me enjoying my front, rear and side cameras on my Toyota since 2010 👁️👄👁️
Me determinantly watching this video knowing I could never afford the car
When I get back from the Moon, I’m getting this;-)
No its manual
The days of the trunk plank are gone
I think the only thing wrong with this car is, it's not a demon.
As a person who hates Chevrolet's cars for them not being reliable, I REALLY want to own this car some day
Engine in the middle... Sounds like an expensive vibrator.
Wait it's now MR?
If only anybody watching this video can afford it
Yeah but I find them to be ugly 😩😩
You sound like the show host from total drama island
The body style looks like a complete copy of a Ferrari
That car looks sexier than a lambo
Great car until you have to pull the engine or anything major, but I’m guessing people with this car money isn’t a problem
These features are actually quite common, in the super car and hyper car scene. Also apart from the bumper rising button, every new car has those.
no thanks, once Mercedes allways Mercedes
You Driving around laguna hills today? Swear I saw this car earlier
Being from Ky I always liked corvettes! Yes there are far fancier cars out there but for a average person they was just in reach and gave the performance of cars 4 times it’s price! And who doesn’t love those America LS V8 engines singing a sweet symphony!
Paying 60k for a car with a plastic body? Yea that makes sense.
Even with all of those features, I still miss Corvet with front engine :(
Americans discovering cameras and nose lift suspension is lovely
If the engine is in the middle how are you supposed to check the oil and preform basic maintenance? Pretty sure this car doesn't run on ego.
Your a little late to the party lmao congrates you are probably the 200th person to post a review about this same car but they did it in 10 times more detail😬🤣😂
Am I the only one who sees that the newer generation of cars got something off in thier looks compared to the late 2000s ?
So all the "useful features" are only useful to people who shouldn't be driving a stingray. If you can't tell the clearance of your bumpers, or if you need a camera to help you reverse you shouldn't be spending that much on a car
Wtf is this abomination of a car
The only thing I dislike about this car is that the engine is in the middle
Honestly not bad features but it’s a corvette.. yea I’m not having people call me greasy knucks.
Nice promotion
Новый Шевроле Корвет это Ламбо для бедных.
CORMARO
I can't even complain, these features all look pretty good
Mechanics are going to hate this and I don't want to think about how much it will cost to fix something.
But if u crash ur dead lol mention that corvette is the unsafest car Chevy makes do to the engine bien in the middle ur likely to get crushed by the motor
What’s everyone talking about that this car is shit. Guarantee if someone gave it to you for free you wouldn’t say no.
Imagine getting to drive this as your driver’s license test car. I don’t even think you can fail with all the cameras.
I love the corvette stingrays hopefully i get one
Watching this makes me feel like I just unlocked a new car in Burnout and it's being explain to me
i love it 🥰
So ugly
My zx10r will still eat this car alive ☺️
Such huge trunks, i can do a family trip in it, such a sensible carrrr
Ngl looks like they're copying gta😐
but it's also a Chevy, so good luck getting it out of the dealership
Americans and there words on switches
like why would we need this vid tf
Americans are easily so impressed with features that are over 10 years old 😭😭 nothing new here to see
First time I’ve seen a “Things that just make sense: Insert car” video that actually has a car with useful features that you would want. Except for that lap timer. Not useful for a consumer, but if you take it for track days where you are allowed to time yourself it could be handy
I feel the car is confused, it wants to a Ferrari and a Lamborghini at the same time
This car has more personality than Tesla drivers
chevy is just built different. they last forever
I have this car on GTA
Yeah Chevy girls great idea 🤡
Chevrolet corvette used to mean rwd big v8 in the front, and now they made a mid ebgined hybrid. The C8 is an affront to god
Tesla left the chat
Finnaly .. chevy started giving helpful features
I’m getting that 💳💥💥💳💥💥💳💥💥
Looks like a fake lambo...
Still not faster than the Z71
This car is fugly and miles behind its competitors
Best money-quality relationship
I actually kinda hate this car
I'm just tired of idiots that never learned to enunciate, (that's pronouncing words correctly and clearly) for example ;  _buh en_  It's _button_ fool!
The sting ray is my dream car
tastes differ. i would not drive this for a 5figure bribe. heeeeell how can u mess up proportions like that. it's like someone slammed a pile of triangles on the ground.
I saw a blue one in Wichita ks
Let's talk in that clichéd American tone; because it just makes sense...
Tesla be like: "Hold my beer."
WTF title is this? Most of sport cars have this features 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Reminds me of the McLaren
Nah, it's not that they make sense. It's if you don't have those features, it makes no sense having it on the road. 🤣🤣
Typical American car enthusiasts things they need to drive.
The camera is to “track your lap times.” Yeah, sure buddy.
At this point it’s to easy to drive they should let kids this generation
No one bought this for the trunk space.
I love that last feature its perfect  Edit: i mean 2nd to the last
This has the same features as my moms car and prob x2 the price
All of that is undone and overshadowed by the biggest major fail with the corvette, which is the ecu that is alway connected to Chevy’s cloud.  if any modifications are detected the ecu is bricked and goes into limp mode until it’s brought to the dealer to be reset (for a fee) and your warranty is voided. This car is essentially untunable unless you go with a stand alone ecu and don’t care about a warranty
Imma get that
What a beautiful car
Looks like a rebadged Lambo.
Damnnnn.  This is an investment. Sign me upp
It just feels like Chevrolet created those features to fix problems that they created themselves in the first place
Ok I hate expensive cars but this one seems really cool if I could get it in purple
My dad has a 68’ stingray, oh mama
Ok but it’s not fast enough
Now that’s one super car
Busted looking … like a discount lambo .
Things that don’t make sense about the c8, 7000 thousand more dollars to add an automatic convertible roof that just 80 pounds even tho the stock one does the same thing manually
It looks shit
Things that do not make sense: The Price
They are behind the convenience race. Corvette is for barbies plus seats can’t fully recline for good ol’ road head. Real race right now battery driven vehicles.
Damnnnnnn if I had these features even in a normal car it would be top notch
Every corvette is starting to look more and more European and less American. I missed the way they looked before like a 1994 C4 Chevrolet Corvette was gorgeous. now we got a cheaper wannabe ferrari Laferrari
Good luck breaking down every 5 minutes
Ferrari called they want their design back
Its not a backup camera, its a backup camera for badasses
That thing looks like an overweight Ford GT wannabe
So, they decided to turn the Corvette into a Lamborghini? Geez @ the copycats. 🙄
That's the new car in gta5 lol
That's the new car in gta5 lol
This is in gta 5 believe it or not 😂
The ONLY corvette that I ACTUALLY admire.
My dad would rather a Porsche GT3RS
Oh man that looks sweet... if only I had the money
This stingray is just so damn beautiful 😮‍💨🥲
things that make sense about a car. its s car
Im getting one of thia one day. Trust me
Never really liked corvettes until this one
It was in the 2019 camaros and so on before it was in the new c8
This is a meta ad
Yo this dude sounds like chris from total drama island
Not a fan. Should’ve just opened a new line
Next the dudes gonna say see these rubber wheels that's so the car can get traction on the road 😂
That's one ugly fuckin car and I'm a chevy guy
Oh men I really like the car.. but it looks so crap from the inside  Why is the US always build such cheap interiors. I mean every 1 series bmw or VW Golf looks better
Ok but can anyone agree with me that the rear end is ugly. Those tail lights are huge
Price?
The reasons I don’t have friends just make sense
Everything that will go wrong. Always carry fuses. One guy will hit a speed hump, get airborne, land, blow an airbag - next YouTube short….
yea 2cm raise...
This car is great but, WHYD YOU GET IT IN YELLOW!? AHHHH
The more I watch his videos, the more it makes sense that he is truly a car enthusiasts.   And the more I see people that are soo me, hate his content from judging it by it's cover.
Or since  thay are all new and thay elitrik
Us it a automatic?
I really dont care for this wannabe ferrari
So I am not a car expert  but are those  gas
Basically just copied the Ferrari when they made this.
Did they run out of budget doing this stuff so they couldn’t put a real engine in it?
Too bad this is going to be the closest thing most of us are ever going see of a car like this
If it's not a C3, it is NOT a real stingray, period...
The all new lamborghini ferrari corvette stingray
My car has this cool sound that goes RANGAGDANDGADANG.  Can your Chevy Corvette do that?
Good to see someone still has a peoplecar idea
All that fucking about looking at different cameras would make me crash that Corvette lol
how much $100? i’ll buy that tomorrow
Kinda sexy
Someone needs to tell blue face about this
Man all these cameras and gadgets are just making people stupid I got hit by someone backing up and they where staring straight into the screen smh
Aaaaah yes the floor here is made out of floor
Those are not fearures, german cars have that like 10 years and more... hahahhaa american cars 🤣🤣🤣🤣 not even worth time...
Love the color but not w black wheels
#notavette
Although a beautiful car, in my area, EVERYONE seems to have one so now it's just another one of those things thats turned stale. I'm tired of seeing corvettes. Now one thing I don't see are Dodge Vipers. Id love to see a couple vipers bullying a corvette every once in awhile
Suggestion: Put black racing stripes on it to look like bumblebee
Only good thing that comes from GM. Also nobody uses the trunk in the back the engine gets way to hot
Ooooh!
Bet my truck could total it with a dent!
*shows features that all new cars have*
I would never really want a car if I had to worry about it every time I pulled into a parking lot.
Look like a Ferrari
“Track your lap times” lmao almost like they want you to beat your top speed
The Chevy bolt has that camera. Yawn
Trunkingfronking!!!!!!
Can you play Forza on it
Not like these features aren’t in cheaper less expensive cars already or anything
Perfect      T I T T S
The front end listing has been a thing is so many other cars for so long
How useful is raising the front end 2 inches? Not much
Maybe this is actually a car that worth the money
Why does it look like a lambo?
Trash car
Wow, really nice features 👍
I'm sorry but it's literally the dumbest Corvette mid engine are you kidding me they took a great car and turned it into shit
My 16 year old Audi tracks lap time I wouldn’t really call that a special feature.
Tesla or nothing
Future Car enthusiasts will only know tech.
So this is what you do for PR and money. Get a life bro
Why is this guy hitting the buttons so aggressively!!!????
Give me that
Look like mclaren
This vette is gorgeous!
Ugly looking car. Trying to stage itself like a European supercar but looks cheap.
A RAV4 limited or almost some models have some of those features plus a fast engine
All of these features are on lots of other cars.
No thanks I’ll take my AWD Subaru outback wagon over that expensive mid engine lemon any day of the week...
Everything. The answer is everything.
this is literally almost every luxury sports car, what?? have you never seen any european sports cars? they almost all have multiple cameras, the ability to lift the front end, stat tracking. it’s almost like this race car was meant to race or something
Tell your dad I like his car...
Okay, you've actually changed my mind on the new corvette... Do you feel better now?! 😄
A trunk in the front? Don't you mean Frunk
That car 🔥
Funny hie the price isn't on the list
It only took 60 years for Chevy to figure out that the engine would be WAY gooder in the back.
Yes the engine might be in the middle but there are two main reasons with that number one it is a pain in the ass to fix but you clearly don’t know how to fix your car anyway from what I can tell and also if the engine blows up you blow up with it rather than having it in the back more efficient and just the back blowing up.
Thanks for reminding me that I’ll never be able to afford one
Coquette D10
Ugly color
Did anyone else think the front cameras were weird
Also it doesn’t have as much trunk space
Or you could just drive it
It’s still gay as hell. It only comes in an automatic
Man,the color 😍😍😍
All of this stuff has been standard for years on certain sports cars glad chevy is finally catching up those bugs
This is a copy cat 🐈 of the Koenigsegg Gemera which is the world's fastest and expensive family car
Welcome to my 85 MR2
So you get 2 extra glove departments
Things that make sense about the new chevy Lamborghini?!?!?
The performance day recorder is also good for the dealers to have evidence that you abused your car and will deny any warranty claims or issues and blame on you.
That shits sooo ugly!!!!
How nice, a knockoff Ferrari.
That is obviously the one they make for the girs. With that color.
So instead of one decent sized trunk I get two that could barely fit a microwave
Disco car 🤮
Just more crap that can go wrong and break. Vehicles in general nowadays are too “high tech” most nothing but plastic parts and computers. Just piles of junk. Planned obsolescence, any mechanic will tell you the same.
Hmp, petroleum dependant  designed to bleed money from the stupid compulsive buyers.
And here I thought China was the only good at making knock off, Ferrari wanna be
It's yellow therefore it's disgusting end of story!!
Hmp! Obsolete primitive technology.
Dude this car needs a spoiler, it don’t look to good without one
I really worry about cameras to back up. If it is at all compromised you are screwed.
You know what doesn’t make sense about the C8 corvettes? Fake vents. Fake vents everywhere.
Get a new paintjob crome would look better
You wanna see cameras? Check out a 2021 f250 with a tow package
Corvette designers reeeally like their Italian and German counterparts lmao
Just 10 features they put out of 500 Features that are already in a Tesla. Way to go Chevy, finally.
I don’t know why but I live in the US and it still threw me off that he said trunk not boot.
Can I just have one please
I would by one. GMC is my Automotive Family. Truth. BullyBilly.
That's basically a lambo
You get 2 boots the same size as a smart cars boot in total
Wow! Amazing! That's not make no since anyway 101%
Mark my words in 5 years ill be driving this car
You forgot to mention the colonoscopy when signing for that bs price tag.
Lame..... you should see my hot wheels
Cars that make driving easier are the reason why bad drivers exist
There ugly af. And made out of plastic.  Vs. The classic corvette rides
It’s actually called a frunk get it right 🤦🏻‍♂️
You still don't get a spare tire, even with two trunks
That 500+hp makes sense tho...
From: "I bought this car because I am a classical man, smitten by the way of the road, and accepting only of American purpose built performance machines. If I wanted a grocery-getter I'd have bought one."  To: "Omg the extra space on both ends! Now when my wife divorces me for spending all of my money on an 'impractical car,' I can fit the kitty litter and the groceries for one on the same trip!"  ... In just one generation!
I like this guys how he starts his video.. From his tone to his video
Listen I like this car although I just don’t know how I feel about the whole middle engine I think they should keep it OG
Things about it I hate;  The fact I can't have one in the UK!
Ugly
I almost owned a corvette. But now I own a Mercedes.
Like Jeremy Clarkson said if aliens come will be hard to explain why a Ferrari costs at least 5 times more.
What doesn't make sense is NO MANUAL OPTION
it's a Corvette there isn't anything that makes sense lmao
The performance won't matter, since you will never be faster than a Viper. 😂😂😂
Looking more and more like a Lamborghini then a Corvette. What a shame. I'll give you credit a lot of that made sense.
All technology features to patch over design flaws.
Not tryna throw shade but those sensors must be crap from preventing people from hitting the car fender because all I hear is about how people mess up their front splitter or fender, especially with the C8
How to flex without actually flexing
btw that data tracker for lap times already exist on c7 tho soo
Did he just call the frunk a second trunk? The audacity of this man
Maybe the first American car that's come out in the last decade or two I think might actually be cool AND worth it
Such a cool car, if only I had $120,000 burning a hole in my pancreas
That yellow is Fire! Still would pay to get it in Guards Red tho.
So if you get in a bad accident the engine would burn from.the middle right under
Does anyone else think it's lame that everyone is a self proclaimed reviewer? Either  that or they have a tick tock cooking show.
Just say stingray
Finally a real, genuine good video showcasing actual small details, thank you
My car has the digital rear view camera and it cost way less than a corvette. All cars should have it standard.
"We should raise the car a little" "Too easy, lets make it hydraulic-lifted even though that's the only way to drive one one the actual road anyway" *Just makes sense*
Like the Pontiac fierro
With a shitty cheap looking plastic interior lol
So my brother spanked one of these today in his 1998 5.9 Dakota R/T
And it starts at 60,000
Why does the back remind me of a Camaro?
things about this channel that just make sense 1. 2. 3.
I'm a Mustang guy, but I do like this model Corvette.
It's a bad ass car no doubt but not much of the Vette look....I get times change but it looks more like a NSX than a Vette...
You know what don't make sense? Computers in the back. Rear ended? Totaled.
Why does it look like a Lamborghini
This guys acting like he’s never seen a mid motor in his life
This car will get alot of hate but for its price and everything you get it's a wicked deal.
great car and all but it still looks silly with that 2 foot ground clearance that it has
So many electric problems bound to happen in the years ahead
Do they still have leaf springs?
It has bags
Even videos that are in Russian and are just a bad Minecraft joke make more sense than this and this sentence
“Trunk is upfront” well no dip Sherlock
Why is everyone so amazed by the fact its mid engined we’ve been doing it in Europe for over 60 years
It's a cool car and all, but it's not a 'Vette. FR layout, or it's a different car.
It’s not a real corvette
This man really got 5 stars
There used to be something called caution and skill wich, if used wisely, can avoid crashing ur car ...
Yet it is slow compared to other cars for the same price.
What a beast and a beauty plus it costs less then most imports and is maybe even faster and more luxurious
All they really did was copy ford ...again..and again
Dream car
Where is engine?
Ehere is engine?
i don’t like the car too much, only because the design kind of strayed away from what the body of a corvette actually looks like and made an evolution into foreign car look alike. it’s my own opinion but i’ve been a fan of chevy up until this specific vehicle. every vehicle before has been spot on. this however is like losing the nostalgia of chevrolet.   imo
That's cool, I would buy one of those
I’d still prefer the 2018 rtr mustang spec 3
Rule number 1 of super car ownership never get caught with your front end lift up
C8*
man, corvettes are looking less and less like corvettes as the years go on
This might be the greatest car ever made in terms of “bang for your buck”. Most mid-engine sports cars with all these features would easily run 200k. Yet with this, you basically get all the same performance and looks and literally half the price. Plus you can literally take it to any chevy dealership.
I’m 15 and my uncle let me drive this exact car and it’s great, turning radius is insane and the steering wheel has a cool design. It’s also has a HUD on the windshield to tell you the speed and everything else so you never have to look down. You can adjust the height and brightness of it
Who knew that mid engine cars have frunks and trunks, who would’ve guessed
That just dont make sense
Okay doug polk
That's cute, this guy thinks THAT'S a trunk lol
Well I need a car now
I fuckin want one never wanted a corvette so bad as this gen
The price tag don't make sense
Wish Toyota would bring back the MR2
How do you work on the engine of the car?
I want this car bruhh. Dream car😩
ITS NOT A FUCKING STINGRAY. ITS A GODAM C8 CORVETTE
Ya but does it get laughs like my Ford focus?
I hate this car so much
🔥🔥🔥
This proves me to me Chevy can indeed make good cars WHEN THEY WANT TO. Why did you ruin the impala series Chevy?! Why!? They barely make it to 50 K miles without a warranty repair now. I had a 2011 v6 impala. I put 450 K miles on it before it died. Not happening with a newer one sadly.
Can it change colour though?
Things that don't: Ancient Tech Non-Multivalve Pushrod V8.
It's still a muscle car though. Sports car? Not quite there yet. Kudos to them, if they continue like this, they may end up with a sports car in 2040. Nice one.
good, now you are broke
Bi*ch corvette corvette
This is quite cool!
Buh-in?
How much this cost?
My fav is the GPS remembering where to lift up
Not for me. Mr Gadget would probably love it.
Never been into Corvette's but thats an awesome car and its mid engined and the balance is meant to be 2nd to none.
Don't get me wrong, that chevvy is beautiful but none of that is new technology. Theres already plenty of cars that have all of this
Interior crocodile alligator I run a chevorle movie theater
Things that DONT make sense on the new corvette: automatic only. Literally would be the perfect American sports car w/ a manual option. (I know the logistics to why they didn’t offer it, doesn’t change the fact it’s a poor choice)
Innovative, thats what we need in the car scene right now. Bravo chevy
I love how the license plate is tst drv (test drive)
The trunks are so small tho
Is a Lambo? Ah no..
Most people forget that camera on the rear view was first invented for the 2019 Cadillac Escalade .🙂
Half grocerie car half race car
The engine is actually in the back of the car behind the Axel
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮💩💩💩💩💩👎💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
That’s a damn Ferrari
All these features are basically standard on most European and Japanese cars. They’ve been optional extra’s for the best part of a decade. I don’t understand why everyone thinks this is so groundbreaking
Such a gorgeous looking vehicle!
Damn, that's an ugly car!
It no longer makes sense, now that Tesla S Plaid exists.
Badass car
Rule 1: Never buy a Chevy
What about the engine being in the middle? Is that a good thing
Looks like wannabe lambo
Impressive for an American made car
Why I love Corvettes. ❤️
I think the consensus is out on this and they're saying it looks like shit.
Wannabe super car🤣 have fun replacing transmission after 30,000 miles
fkn corvette doesn’t even look like a vette anymore 😔 what a loss of one of the most iconic american cars ever made :(
I didn't like this car at first but its really growing on me
Chevy is ass lol
legit thought the monitor broke when he turned on the bumper cameras not knowing its split screen
Wtf hmmmm
Rich old white dudes and their Asian wives Probably will never take these to the tracks, but ok.
Get a base model and tell me if it does everything the same
I’m sorry but it’s bloody ugly lol
Lets be honest u buy that where i live its gonna be raised for 99% of the time
Damn i want this car
Sadly, these cars are way more expensive in Europe.
So the stingray comes stock bagged
Ugly as duck car
I can't wait for front facing cameras to be standard on all vehicles.  Also I am a huge fan of Chevrolet, but their quality has gone out the window in the last 40 yrs.
I would buy one if I was not me !
The back camera is clearly used to see the mustang drivers face when he loses
There’s one of those on the ram 1500 Big Horn 2021
The lap times was copied from dodge, and the lift to not scrape the bottom was copied from the Lamborghini huracan
You wanna know what doesnt make sense. The car that he was with has the rear view mirror camera and the front lift but not the z51 package. What a joke!
Can't wait in 10 years when all that tech needs to be repaired
One of my fav cars
I was alr planning to get but now it’s even more
Now this car is amazing!
That yellow is gonna look like piss in 5years
One thing that doesn’t make sense: The sticker price for a lot of them💯
Chevy better than tesla😐😐
C8 owners are starting to act like Tesla Owners.
Ir get a corvette c5 or c4
Those features may make sense but this car just dosent
That mirror was nice
gotta love the amount of people jacking themselves off to this hideous car 💀
Would be amazing if we had most American cars in the uk with right hand drive instead of most crap european cars
Looks like a fake Lamborghini
Top Gear anyone? This garbage has been on the market for years. Old news...
*The farrari stingray*
Stingray where is it all i see is a c8
I love corvettes especially stingrays but when i see the new corvette i feel like it looks more like a Lamborghini than a corvette
Good deal
That's how you see that engineers actually work their asses off to give people what they need in this kind of cars.
It should be called the mako not a stingray
The smartest and fastest car I’ve ever driven
It’s has its engine fucking where???
I thought that camera was for looking at the people you just gapped
Can you use the lifty thing while yhe car is moving or in high gear
Not a fan bro
So they made a fiero and stole tech from a Lamborghini…
I swear the background music is Headie one Princess cuts
*my girl would still scrape it over bumps*
Amazing car all around yellow just sucks on it 😂
I want this car!! Seen 3 in one day last week.
So they decided to make a Ferrari with a little extra trunk space
Bro that’s a corvette c8
“Hey campers! This is some features on a c8 corvette that just make sense dudes” ~Chris McLean sounding dude
The new Chevy Corvette has a button to where you can press it and go over bumps and not scrape the bottom yet it goes up like a quarter of an inch 😂😂
My 2002 Citroën C5 not only lifts the front, but also the back.  *Goes away crying trying to find a new car with that suspension...
I can tell you what DOESN’T make sense: 1.engine in the back 2.turbos on a corvette
It’s a corvette. Nothing makes sense about it. It’s an expensive Camaro
That thing uglyyy...
More shit to break and pay to fix! I wouldn't take that car if you gave it to me..
what an actual informative video  i was expectimg the usual "the car can be unlocked with the key" or "you can change the tempereature on the ac" but no actual features that make life easyer for the car owner
🔥🌊💦🔥🌊💦🔥🌊💦🔥🌊💦
Beautiful ride bro!!
I see you in 10 years when that toy is worth $3000. Pure junk. Sad really. Corvettes are my #1 car, up until 83
Steve Erwin is so bad ass he wouldn't hold a grudge and to prove it, he'd ride one
This car just kept making me think this is a midlife crisis car.
More of a Ford guy eh
Ammm. How many years do modern Chevies last? Are they reliable?
Everyone in the comments saying "it's not a stingray it's a c8" are making me want to shoot myself
Scotty Kilmer entered the chart
This guy is extremely rich God dang he literally got Thomas the train , scary monster cars ,spoder man convertible , cherry corvette god daaang 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😅😅😅😅😅😅🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
How much is C8?
"So you get a trunk in the back and front" and both of them have barely any space in them...
How do u make a video and not mention the specs of the motor
You can only a polish a turd so much.
0 luggage space 😂
Wow, the “camera” almost on the roof isn’t the backup camera? Jesus Christ who would’ve known.
Bruh everything he said has been on almost every non American sports car expect some Porsches
Damn
Poor man’s Ferrari
I could buy one of these or I could buy a hellcat super stock yeah I’m going with the super stock
Stingray? That’s a C8😂
The stingray on the hood looks like it has a tramp stamp
This is just a way for him to show off all his cars
Why does the front camera view look like boobies
From muscle to sport. I'm sticking Hellcat
how much is it
Is this as practical as 911 then?
Still should have a manual option...
Wait did he take the spoiler off? Or is this without z51?
Why does he sound like the one guy from total drama island in the beginning
Usually these videos showcase features that dont make sense but this one actually did make sense like all of the features are incredibly smart and convenient I love chevy
Idk this doesn’t seem like it just makes since
That's s cool car but it's gonna suck trying to fix it
So what’s the price?
I'd like a 355 Ferrari as my mid engine car. A C2 and C6 for Vettes
With all that technology to keep from curbing bumpers and wheels women would still figure it out how to
More problems 😅🤣🤣 things your about to spend more money on and more sensors f Chevy 🤣😅
Always wanted to get one now im more motivated after seeing those cool features!
cool.  but still waiting for my Tesla
But wait it's not a stingray it's  C8
Show the new land rover  It also has many features
See, a car with useful features and actually worth the money
The price makes sense too 😉
How this guy got so many cars
Not shitting on the stingray I’m a fan of the c8 and early zr1 but all these new “review” videos always just talk about the specs, never about how the actual engine life has been upgraded or various other upgrades with performance, some reviews do it but it’s rare and it’s what I wanna see but this is okay too ig
I thinks that’s a c8 bud
Sounds expensive if anything goes wrong damn
Chevy didn't add a camera because it's hard to see back there. Back up cameras are required by DOT requirements.
GMC has that camera to
Golf is better tho
one question i have is why mid engine as opposed to a front or back? is there a speed advantage?
that car is so damn beautiful, very ferrari-esque
Can someone buy me one please?! I work hard everyday. Maybe one day I will own one!!
It's stupidly ugly because it dose not have a spoiler
Still all about the lexus lfa personally.
Wow, never seen a car that's had to make so many extra buttons just to fix problems.
Lap times? I doubt that many people who could afford this would put it on a track but ok.
Junk
That's my dream car right there
My single trunk in the back is 4 times larger
GOD AND JESUS BLESS YOU ALL IN JESUS MIGHTY AND POWERFUL NAME WE PRAY AMEN 🙏❤️
And that's the rise of the new age
Well hello there BUMBLEBEE 🤖🤖
