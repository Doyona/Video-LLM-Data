josh stealing an ice cream machine and then complaining it took 45 minutes to make ice cream "i know cause i stole it" is just so funny to me for some reason 😂
His Shane impression was way too good
Nope
Can we get Shayne Topp on Last Meals PLEASEE??
You put Shayne in the thumbnail and I thought he’d (naturally) be in the video. To my shock and awe, he was not  I have been tricked, and fooled, and you have hooked me, good sir. Good video rho
exactly what you want your chef to say, "dont ask me about food safety thats not my game"
why is he so, frantic😭
I kinda want to eat this now, can this be a real dish?
The best thing about Josh is that he tries so desperately to be funny but he doesn't know what's funny so he just says stuff and it doesn't work like ever
the energy here vs on last meals… i’m so confused (in a good way)
I never realized how short shane top was till now
I would love to eat the burger without the ice cream, but I feel like it would be such a confusing mouthfeel
Tartare is the only time I like to use fresh cut meat.
Anybody getting Charlie day in the kitchen vibes from this?
hammed.... burder??????
8:47 That was THE MOST SPOT ON Shayne Impression I have ever seen
Forgot the lettuce
Even years later this is making me crave Mett (a raw minced pork dish)
You seem so high in this video and i love it
It's wild to see how far Mythical Kitchen has come in just a few years time. I totally forgot Josh used to callout the timestamps. lol
I’m sorry, if cream!?
Meatbrochen.
This video was actually my gateway drug into Smosh. I heard of them and checked out the old videos and I just couldn't get into it. I am a huge fan of GMM, then became a fan of Mythical Kitchen. I went back and checked out Smosh and saw the newest TNTL and i was hooked!
9:23 Wisconsin-ly
am I crazy for wanting poke now?
I miss these cooking videos
Im am indeed from Wisconsin and that is indeed a thing. Never had it myself but my grandpa used to eat those. To be fair, you’re supposed to buy beef that is higher quality/ specifically marked for that if you plan to eat it raw
7:12 😭😂
2:05 not going to lie I wasn’t paying attention until I heard BTS and then I had to rewind it to hear what I missed 😭😭😭
9:24 how do you cook something wisconsinly?
The quantity of Heavy Weights references in Mythical Kitchen makes me feel less old!
Omg Josh i eat vanilla ice cream with a squeeze of ketchup in it all the time! Ketchup ice cream works!
Im gonna be honest, the one and only time i tried Beef tartare i found it delicious but i also took psychological damage because i just can't bring myself to trust trust raw beef. Why do i really want to try this
You can tell josh is actually sad
@6:21 "It is my honor Tony!"
I have legitimately never wanted anything more.
13:40 Loki
7:53  I'm sorry what are we gonna do, Josh?!?!
Good Shane impression at 8:40
The porkchure of Dorian grey 😂😂😂😂
Why does he sound so much like Hank Green in this vid 😂 He doesn’t usually, it’s gotta be how unhinged this is 🤣
This is how I learned HOW the burger but cold was made and honestly the fact it was a quick 10 minutes is just hilarious
"Howmstever" is a travesty
Manic Josh is WILD
13:36 i think hades would forgive you. im sure he's tired of all the heat and craves a cold burger
Can we bring this series back?!?!
this is giving mettbröchen on acid
Needed tomato ND lettu e
You should do more of these 😅
hello josh. i am trembling with a fever and i had a horrible visceral reaction to you biting into that burger. congrats
he seems so happy from his creation
Isn’t tar tar cooked with acidity
I am genuinely so happy that Ian and Anthony own Smosh now, but there were some real treats that came out of Mythical and Smosh chilling in the same building...
Is there an "I hate Josh" club I can officially join? And is Shane already the leader of it
sometimes, things that are more money, are worse.
I’m discovering mythical and smosh content from 3 years ago that I had no time to look at as a full time student XD I’m still a full time student but I can actually breathe now
I was recommended this video exactly 2 years after it was posted (13/1/25)
From wikipedia   Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite that may be found in raw or undercooked meat.[21] A multicentre case-control study found inadequately cooked or inadequately cured meat as the main risk factor for toxoplasma infection in all centres.[22] Due to the risk of congenital toxoplasmosis in the fetus, pregnant women are advised not to eat raw meat.[23] Latent toxoplasmosis, which lasts a lifetime, has been shown to cause poorer memory in the infected elderly.[24] Latent toxoplasmosis in adults has been thought to, but not proven to, cause psychological effects[25][26] and lower IQ[25] in some studies.
as someone from Wisconsin- wtf is a cannibal sandwich
the cannibal sandwich sound similar to german Mettbrötchen
As a wisconsinite all I am going to say is was when he said he was making a raw beef sandwich I went “oh a cannibal sandwich, cool!” and then he made fun of me :( 4:47
"I think he said something about avocado toast that I didn't like?" 💀
This genuinely looks delicious
So a glorified ice-cream sandwich?
rewatching older videos with josh just made me realize how much he’s been bulking the last few years
"Which god would be most likely to forgive us?"   Asking the real questions.
"Dont ask me about food safety, that's not my game."  It's literally the most significant game you have to play as a chef 😂😂
Burger but cold, or in germany Mettbrötchen
as a german raw meat looks delicious :3
13:37 Grandfather Nurgle would forgive you.  Cause that's who tf you summonin with this burger!
Do it to it Lars! I love heavyweights! 6:20
7:15 the casual mention of homemade bacon pancake ice cream made me pasue the whole video to contemplate who told bro to cook like that
As a Wisconsinite- WE DONT SOUND LIKE DAT LMAOOO
Sorry Shane! Damn 🤦🏽😂
You've created unimaginable horrors out of a simple food crime
I’m from Wisconsin. We definitely have cannibal burgers still. My grandma is the only female I know that eats them though.
be nicer man Shane's just trying to have a nice convo. with u and he knows u like food lol
Shayne wanted to ask for more lol
If the meat was cooked i would 100% make this
Sorry, but tartare is disgusting
Americans being concerned over raw beef is wild to me. In Belgium and the Netherlands we have Filet Americain which is raw beef made into what can be described as a spread. Originally eaten with fries, but (at least in the Netherlands) now more populair on sandwiches. Store bought stuff has conservatives and the butcher makes it fresh everyday. You just have to consume it the same day and you’re fine. Never heard of anyone getting sick from it.
I'm actually from Wisconsin. I'm proud of the raw meat stuff here. And your bit with the Cannibal Sandwich had me in tears. My grandfather ate those all the time and yup....That was the general opinion when the Surgeon General told us to stop eating those sandwiches...R.I.P Grandpa Ray
13:40, My wife. Who is Hindu. Rekons maybe not Vishnu... Something about raw beef yada yada
What is Josh even talking about most of the time? It's all nonsense
Never ever will you catch me esting Raw beef. Real stupid hours over here
The chewing is a no
Missed the opportunity to add a leaf or two of *iceberg* lettuce
I know the video is up for a while now, but I have one question. Are pickled cucumbers just pickles, or is it 2 different thing?
Thank you so much for the Dorian Gray allusion. You're not dumb if you've that story. You rock!  ❤🎉😊
I hear Hank Green in your voice.  I bet you do a good impression of him.
Should’ve used bread dough instead of buns
Wait Shayne said he'd be hiking some mountain somewhere.... didn't he propose on a mountain hike? Was this right before he proposed?!
Oh god no, not raw beef
Never forget this was RACHEL’s idea
This is the first mythical kitchen video ive ever seen lmao I'm now terrified of josh this is awesome
Americans not appreciating beef tartare is so wild to me
this man talks A LOT
9:14 he’s asking the real questions
But what if you cooked that patty?!?!
fancy french dish or not, fancy hat or not, no one can pay me enough to eat raw meat. absolutely not. pass.
I live in Wisconsin, I had no idea that my raw beef sandwiches was called a cannibal sandwich… I’m not sure how I feel about that.
As someone from wisconsin, we have the same accent as you 😭in fact I know someone who sounds exactly like you
what did i watch
I'm not gonna lie, I'm too scared to eat beef tartar... I don't wanna get sick
Josh: I think about death a lot Also Josh: *You can eat anything raw*
14:43 Josh is just thinking to himself: "Am I a good man? Am I a mad man?"
Beef tartare is not french. :(
The most dangerous thing you likely do every day is walking up/down stairs.
More like uncooked burger
Can’t get enough of how Josh just bum rushed Shayne during what I imagine to be his lunch break, shoved a camera into his hand and made him eat raw beef
"Wisconsinly, otherwise youreggsgonscramble!"
i actually wanna try this lmao
You could go a little further with a chilie pepper frozen Belgian waffle to add another level of cold element.
I don't understand putting ketchup in a bowl just to take it from the bowl to add to a recipe
If you haven't watched this at 2x speed it makes josh even funnier 😂
Milk steak cannibal style
Dionysis would forgive you. He's the god of chaos and revelry, he'd be down with burger but cold because of the decadence
Wasn't even his idea, it was his wife's.
"Which god would forgive us.?.?.? Vishnu?" Had me dying laughing... Definitely not
In Germany we call that mett
I've eaten cold burgers so many times.
to think that shayne asked a question in beopardy about a fact josh mentioned in a video about smosh.
I was here for the tartare, but you lost me at the ice cream.
A pseudocarp... A strawberry is a pseudocarp.  Well i had the chance to pause the video and google it... But... Pseudocarp...
Josh has become so unhinged upon eating the icecream burger that he has lost himself to his own ramnlings
THE HEAVYWEIGHTS REFERENCE 🎉🙌🔥 I say this quote all the time but no one ever seems to know it
He killed his impression of Shayne 🤣🤣🤣
I can imagine George Motz trying to justify this mess.
mmmm dogfood
"Let's do it to it, Lars!" 🤣 "I'm feeling skinny, Tony!"
For those wondering! The reason you can have steak rare/close to raw is because most of the bacteria that makes us sick lives and grows on the outside! If you wanna do steak tartare at home, you can trim the outside with a CLEAN knife, then move it to a clean cutting board with a diff knife for cutting up, and it should be safe! (Do your own research, it CAN still get you sick, it just decreases the odds!)
I've never known anyone say Worcestershire that weird.  Correct: Wuss-terr-sheer  Murican: War Chester Shyer  Josh: Wiss-ter-shee
You didn't even put BTS in the thumbnail and I still showed up 😂
ist halt einfach ein mettbrötchen
That was such an on point impression of Shayne
I can’t take this seriously with shane…. The dude has grave mouth😂
8:47 why is his shayne so good….. what the hell its almost like they know eachother even
Love to see the Rhett and Link media empire practising the ancient Persian Zoroastrian traditions of divine marriage.
u can eat raw beef?
it's so good because you made it
The one time I ate raw hamburger was at work in WI in the nineties. The supervisor brought in ground chuck,
if only Kush had seen this before Snow Way Out...
pickles and kornishons - two different things for me
I wasn't expecting a Wisconsin shout out.
did he say red wine vin? vin is wine
Josh has so many thoughts (/pos). I wish I had that many thoughts.
Josh: In wisconsin, they eat something called a cannibal sandwich.  Also Josh: I love tartar on a brioche bun. ...
i think im in love 🤣🤣
sometimes when I hear Josh talk and I close my eyes, I hear Tucker from RvB I stg
The casual Heavyweights reference at 6:19 makes me so happy. I say that sometimes and it is rarely understood.
Josh saying "No one's ever done that before!" about the beef tartar ice cream somehow has the same vibes as Ed in OFMD saying "Haven't tried that before...haven't died"
That was a great Shayne impression actually wow
"This is what you you would call.....a..pot" "Do you see it? Iz cheese....Iz yellow" - a professional chef
as someone who doesn't like beef or pickles...disgusting. still gonna watch tho
BTS wasnt in the thumbnail 💔
I refuse to believe the mythical kitchen peaked at cold burger
Has Josh been on anything else besides this show I feel like I recognize him from somewhere
"I got a bunch of french parasites"  "A bunch of peopleget ecoli every year from eating raw beef burgers"   Such amazing endorsements
You remember when boys would make atrocities by mixing everything on their lunch tray. Yeah that’s just this video.
Josh I grew up on a farm in Wisconsin and have never heard of the cannibal sandwich lol and keep working on your Wisconsin accent 😂❤️❤️❤️
This reminds me of Amharan (Ethiopian region ) kitfo. Shout out to my Habesha GMK fans out there <3
Spot on Shae impression.
damn im from recine wisconsin and i dont think i sownd like that
josh r u okay 💀
12:10 - honestly, tartare ice cream isn't a terrible idea... You could do like a tartare-au-poivre ice cream type thing. Steak au-poivre already uses a cream sauce as the base; and black-pepper ice cream already exists. Put those flavors into some ice cream, cut the sugar by as much as possible, and then figure out a way to incorporate tartare chunks into it... The idea isn't quite *all the way* there, but it's got good bones.
Brrrger
this is basically how Mr. Freeze eats.
Ya know, ya had me till the horseraddish. Sadly my weak self is deathly allergic to flavor.
The Viewer: Is this safe to eat? Josh: Do you jaywalk?
Josh.... The fact you *_DON'T_* wear a ""cool"" hat, makes you SO much better than the ""fancy"" chefs!! ❤ I would much rather eat at Chateau de Mythical, than a fancy joint, because at _Mythical_ I can still be myself, there are no expectations of us!
Johnny Cakes watches ketchup ice cream, holding back the Tomato Soup Macaron war flashbacks.
8:46 such a good Shayne impression
Josh: *preparing raw BEEF to eat* Also Josh: Vishnu would be most likely to forgive us right?
Did he just eat a raw burger
"Do it to it, Lars!"  "I'm feeling skinny, Tony!"
I grew up eating Cannibal Sandwiches on some holidays. We'd do them open-faced on dark rye with some salt, pepper, and raw onion slivers. Delicious!
I never realized how similar in voice/mannerisms Josh and Brian David Gilbert are until i watched this  Edit: hank green and bdg love child
lmfao i think i want to :D love shayne and josh!!!
I don’t jaywalk can’t
Garrett is the kind of dad that'd give you shrooms instead of alcohol on your 21st
why do shaynes eyes look so puffy in the thumbnail??
I love how Josh is like the only person who can completely blindside Shayne with his insanity
Cold burger just sounds like Mettbrötchen to me
he cut his right pinky when making shayne's burger
I want Alvin from Burger show  to eat this
Yeah basically 90% of anything edible is edible raw the fear is more in the diseases that it carries and now with super vaccinated livestock and growing food processing securities its like less than one percent of you food will actually make you sick and most of that comes in at the shipping and food preparation steps and can be easily mitigated and of course theres always the random outbreak scares which gets a call back on a certain type of meat from one specific farm over produced over a month period every 10 years or so but even then most of thats even safe and they are just over reacting to make sure that nobody gets sick and files a legal claim
blep
16:47 "All I ate for breakfast this morning was raw beef and ice-cream" is not a sentence I ever thought I'd hear and be envious of
It’s called Black Cat in Wisconsin
top notch shane impression LMFAO
The thousand-island ice cream and Josh's anecdotes surrounding it makes me think so much of Brian David Gilbert's old bay ice cream!
09:23 I thought he said "Wisconsinly" instead of "whisk constantly" at first. lol
Love the enthusiasm 🧡
8:47 that was such an accurate shayne impression
I love that these are recommended now that Smosh is back like we all know they're gonna be a freaking slammer I'm so hyped for le return
walks up to a coworker, hands them a camera, makes them eat raw beef
I love beef tartare. It’s just so tasty.
13:32 I thought he was leaning in to give it a l'il kiss on the top.
Omg they actually used burger king XD
Burger but cold is just burger King😂
Fun fact for Josh, Wisconsin is in fact not in the south. LOL So having heard several other Wisconsinites make that particular impassioned statement, think the same energy but less Foghorn Leghorn and more Fargo.
Now we need beef tartare but hot
I don't think you wanna be choosing a hindu god for forgiveness on this one, Josh. Considering you're eating raw cow and all that...
Mythical Kitchen? This is Existential Crisis Kitchen! I love it 😂
I feel like this is josh subtitle way to get back at shayne
"It's yellow" "Yeah"
this honustly look delicious
"Eat it or Yeet it"? Never heard of it. "Garet Pum"? Never heard of him. Are you SURE you are talking about Smosh? The channel that died like 9 years ago?  RIP Ian and Anthony, aka Smosh.
“It’s it catch up? Is it bar-ba-q sauce” 😂I love how Nicole & Josh are having a full on convo as he’s whisking the IceCream base, but at the same time the stove is still on, smoking😭😂
As a native from Wisconsin. I can say that accent was spot on
If Shayne and Josh were a ship they would be called the double quarter pounder🤣🍔
All the way through the vid I was salivating at the thought of eating that burger. It looks so yummy to me ><
Tiger meat is almost the same as beef tartar, but it is spicy. All the people saying that they will continue to eat it are right, it is awesome.
Mesmerizing to watch because, on one hand, you're incredibly well informed and exceptionally talented and experienced but on the other hand you are clearly a racoon piloting a muscular meat suit.
Josh has the energy of a drunk hank green and I'm living for it
Germany also does raw meat! Sometimes in a sandwich, sometimes in the form of a hedgehog ?!  Mettbrötchen it's called :)
PSEUDOCARP!
"A real psychosexual cluster fluff" it sure is Josh, it sure is
beef tartare isnt usually using ground beef tho. usually cut up in small cubes.
...do we consider cheddar yellow or orange tho?
When I was first treating my POTS (a disorder where one of the treatments is to intake more salt) I would absolutely salt the everloving hell out of my ice cream and it was the tastiest ice cream I’ve ever had
I know Josh is a professional chef, but god, his words do not convince me so... 💀  But I guess that's what makes Josh unique 😂
I had steak tar tar the first time this year. It had capers in it and a raw egg on top. I was so nervous but it was really delicious and fresh and I felt better than when I eat a burger.
So I understand you can eat raw beef butI am pretty sure you can't eat raw eggs thats why they say not to eat raw cookie dough??? Just saying this is making me quesy
Im here for the libertarian slander
JOSH'S SHAYNE IMPRESSION IS IMPECCABLE
I have seen this more than once and just now noticed that Josh made a Cow Burger and asked Vishnu for forgiveness.  Odin help us
impression of Shayne was spot on
What’s the quality of Josh’s breath on the average day
isnt this just Burger but Raw
Josh is smart to an extent but only for his memorized thought process which only helps so much as he individualizes certain recipes. I wish he would just pause for his thoughts. You think fast but you need more to assume others have something to say
8:45 Those mannerisms are insanely good.
Is weird because i can remember our mouths have in the past or still have the Teeth behind our mouths that we use in the past to eat uncooked meats but if you buy good quality meat cleaned well and have a clean cook space you can eat beef tartare taste good really
He said my name ❤️ 🧀
As a Wisconsinite I can attest.. my grandpa eats cannibal sandwiches 😂
Beef tartare is a worse crime than cold burger
This video feels like when a kid is making you a play-dough meal and telling you how great it is and you just have to smile and nod
Mythical blows
Tempering the egg yolks for a custard is a real thing because if you add it all to the scalding milk it will scramble almost immediately, and if you add the egg yolks to the milk cold and then cook it like that the eggs will cook faster than the milk
Having just found this video, and living in WIn AND eating cannibal sandwiches my whole 30+ on this earth. I can tell you it is very much a thing here.
Americans re-inventing the German Mettbröttchen ;-)
This is a pretty interesting experiment, but I'd change one thing: that patty is WAY too thick. As a normal burger, that thickness would be fine. With tartar, it's just way too squishy to hold any kind of shape as you're eating it. As you eat, it's just going to squish out and parts of it are going to fall out of the bun.
it’s yellow… 😀
As someone who comes from Worcestershire, I can honestly say that Josh is the first American I have ever heard pronounce Worcestershire sauce correctly
okay so i live in mn so the fact you said wisconsin is funny i havent left the tri states ever other then when i was like 3 and cant remember... ive only had steak tartar while  hanging with people in iowa lol and we call it raw dog lol most of my family is from the iowa area and mn lol
Only reason for the thumbs down was for taking the Lord’s name in vain
should do more of this
I think Strawberries are considered nuts. Bananas, Melons, Cucumbers and Pumpkins are Berries, I think.
I feel like I've been lied too
"Which god do you think would be most likely to forgive us?"  Names the god of a culture that is very specifically anti-beef.
Most Unkosher Meal EVER!🤣
"let's just do it to it Lars." 😂 Damn I thought I was the only one that quoted that line
THE MEAT IS NOT COOKED!! Is this an American thing?
Anyone notice the accidental happy face :) the sauce drips made startling at 14:41? Rather apropos. Love you Josh!
I now want a series of Josh making incredibly decadant ice creams.
i like how josh asked if vishnu would be the god most likely to forgive him as he’s preparing a raw beef (aka cow) burger
i feel like josh would like mettbrötchen
It's incredible that all of this was made possible by two dudes from north Carolina with huge ambition
As a German, eating raw ground beef isn't... Weird, I always forget that that *isn't* something other countries do lmfao
That sounded good, when you were making it. I want to try it so badly, I might just make it. 😛😛😛🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠
I'm not sure if this episode just has Extra ADD energy or that Josh is always like this but I am determined to find out
as a vegetarian (due to most meat making me sick) and someone who is also lactose intolerant this dish is my *WORST* nightmare. incredible job josh, i salute you
Everything is edible but sometimes only once
Ice cream raw meat!
I don't approve of that horrible wisconsin accent
beef tar tar is still gross. Doesn't matter that some French !@#$ managed to get people to eat raw beef and think it was a good idea.
"fancy french dish" = something cavemen ate before fire-.-
Howmstever. Why come. I love the way this guy talks.
I feel like Bacchus is the God you need to talk to for forgiveness lmao.
"Which god would be most likely to forgive us?" Is a raw-ass line, and I am totally stealing it
I don't know why, but I think I'm just to conditioned to not eat raw meat to enjoy something like this. I've had a similar Thai dish that's basically a tartar but with raw blood instead of egg yolk and didn't enjoy it in slightest.
Josh you have to say Worcestershire sauce like a southerner worshishire
Hi from Germany, and I will go and eat a Mettbrötchen now!
"Which god do you think is more likely to forgive us? Vishnu?"   Well, ya got me there. Odin? Zeus? Amaterasu? Let's run the gamut of pantheons and see what we come up with.
WTF Did i just watch?!?!?!?!!
I say "let's do it to it Lars" all the time!! I'm glad I'm not alone with the random movie quotes.
😂 😂 😂 "Do you jay walk? We do a lot of things that are dangerous" for those actually wondering though, chicken you can't eat raw because there's a strong chance of salmonella, but most red meats and fish, the worry for bacteria is mostly from contact such as in the cutting room before it's shipped, thus why you have to sear and aren't supposed to do med rare burgers, so as long as it's handled properly it's safe to eat however you want Update: had a chance to try beef tartare recently, would 100% not care if it wasn't safe
This Josh guy is unhinged. I like it.
Wait does the mythical kitchen make foods for good mythical morning,smosh, and the try guys cause I’ve heard all three of them talk about it
Eating raw meet is nothing only french do. One of the best things you can put on bread is "Zwiebelmett", which is raw pork. You can ask every german about that and they will know it.
Why does Shayne look like Tom Scott in the thumbnail
josh is the only person who can put chaos shayne
Love this channel, but PLEASE stop with the short zoom jumps.  It's incredibly unsettling, harsh and unnecessary.  Everything else is awesome!
"Which god do you think is most likely to forgive us Vishnu?" 🤣🤣🤣
I love eating food cold Straight from the fridge
Josh reminds me of Hank Green
This is the first video of mythical kitchen I see and I must say I wasn't expecting this brand of "equal part cooking equal part mid-life crisis" but I'm kinda into it
deplatform mythical chef josh (for his own good)
Could you do like a pressed duck sorbet?
This is worse than anything Garrett has done. I'll take the bugs over thousand island ice cream.
Raw beef with raw egg!  Sounds Korean to me!  Yum!
This just makes me miss food fears.
Weird French Parasite new band name
shayne has pretty hands
How do you pronounce wurstschere sause properly?
As someone from Wisconsin… Can Confirm.
Lol, just doesn’t seem like he even cares at all.
This man lost his mind years ago and its so fun to watch this little insane man do his projects.
Josh is right, you dont need to cool down the liquid. The Mpemba effect proves that hot liquid freezes faster than liquid thats cooled.
In Germany we have "Mett" which is like tartar but less seasoned
I need that bacon pancake ice cream recipe.
I believe it tastes like mayo bc when adding the oil to the egg mixture you emulsified it slightly, the same process by which you make regular mayo with the same ingredients but im no chef
Honestly I think where he went wrong is there's WAY too much sauce on the burger. Like would you ever put two HEAPING spoons of sauce on your cheeseburger?
god this is weird to watch because of my name
Shayne’s tiny bites are sending me into hysterics
I LOVE tartare. People always think I’m crazy for it. 🤷🏼‍♀️
as a wisconsinite cannibal sandwiches are fantastic along side some spotted cow and beer soaked brats.
just try german zwiebel mett ^^ thank me later
Idk why you’re dissing WI. You got that type of voice that makes someone want to binge drink and we always need a reason. 🤷🏼‍♂️
Just think how Rhett n link feel when they eat ur "will it" foods
now, i'm not servesafe certified, but i have been around kitchens. the USDA has a limit of what is considered beef...and beef that is considered by the USDA as "beef" has a min/max temperature as well as length of shelf stability. i forget the actual temperatures, but pretty much it's a buffer between a maximum cold and minimum hot. i think mostly the maximum cold temp is more for storage, and less for serving...however, if it's safe to store and later cook up to minimum hot temp, then technically the max cold temp can be served, and safely consumed. similar to oysters....SO...if prepared correctly, the only thing you have to fear of beef tartare is 100% mental.
Oh, Joshua. A seasoned raw meat burger? I will stick to eating raw fish (sushi).
I just went to Lille, France. There is a burgerjoint called  La Dinette there, where this actually is on the menu. Beef tartare burger with truffle, mushroom carpaccio, roquette, coeur de boeuf tomato and truffle mayonaise. I've tried it and it was freaking delicious!
"Do it to it Lars!" Long live heavyweights
HIS SHAYNE TALK AJSGDHASGDAS so true thats just how he sounds...................
"Which god would be willing to forgive us - Vishnu?"   Considering Vishnu is a Hindu god, I don't think so? You used beef, brother. Comes from cow. Cows are sacred. In the "don't kill or eat" kind of sacred.
and then they die shortly
Ice cream raw meat. 🤣
Why hasn't Josh been on TNTL yet? We've seen Trevor's influence (memes)...and applauded because we're (most of us) not stupid and he's obviously crazy close to many members of the cast. But we've seen Josh on other channels too. And we need to see him, Nicole, or Vi rep on some other platforms. Please!!
I feel Loki would forgive this food crime if it was used in the right ways. For enjoyment, likely not, for giving to others, probably
beef tartare ice cream will probably happen on this channel soon  edit: also, like, no cakey bun?
You can eat anything at least once
13:37 You're making a beef burger and you think a Hindu god is going to forgive you?! Wow.
Who reads morris code. I think Josh is saying something when telling Garrett to call him son
I feel like vishnu would frown on the consumption of beef
Are those glass bowls? Surprised they didn't shatter from the hot to cold thing
i would watch a tiktok of you eating the beef straight from the grinder, but with aggressive eye contact
“If there’s a will, there’s a way”-Josh 2022
Josh, you are one of my favorite humans. Don’t change a goddamn thing
the manic ravings of an unhinged lunatic  spectacular
Ew
I once made the choice to try Beef Tartare in an airport restaurant outside of Paris. That was an interesting gastrointestinal journey, let me tell you. I will now never look at Ancien Grains moutard the same way again
Sounds like a fancy version of a classic german snack/construction site meal, called Mett Brötchen, which is a simple bread roll, with freash minced pork, salt, black pepper and diced onions
The government cannot stop me from eating my raw meat
Josh got into the cooking wine again
Cannibal sandwiches are legit tho Nothing beats lean ground beef, salt, black pepper, and some thick-sliced white onion on marble rye
Burger!!!! But Cold!! Ahahahahah!!!!
Josh, you are amazing BUT CAN YOU PLEASE SCRAPE YOUR BOWLS????? There's always a ton of stuff left in them 😩
Strawberries are a pseudocarp. "False fruit" but tomatoes  just like  avocados, and eggplants are  considered  scientifically a "berry" and a fruit......this is knowledge that got me considered a  weird teacher's  pet. But basic biology and botany is  something I  consider a good base for natural  survival. But if you  drop knowledge like how tons of veggies like kale, broccoli and  tons of other vegetables derived from wild cabbages. Well people make fun of how you "think broccoli grows collard greens and kale". Then you'll stop giving people your cool nuggets of plant wisdom. Smh. Love your weird brain Josh. Feels like  home. <3
In very tiny forms it would be great actually. Like ordorves
I live in Wisconsin.  Everything he said was accurate.
I will not question the power of Josh here, I am just mildly concerned about the raw meat. I know he's pointing exactly at people like me with the whole beef tartare comment, but I'm mildly concerned
Fresh raw beef is safe to eat, however, you shouldn't buy minced meat from the supermarket to make it, because the one danger comes from them not cleaning the machine properly, which can then lead to dangerous bacteria infecting the meat.
Bacon Ice cream is awesome
4:07 the closest an American has ever come to pronouncing Worcestershire. It's pronounced "war-stir-sheer"
What the hell deep weed is? Cheeses! - Josh
I would eat this a lot and now i'm craving some tartare
Me, an anarcho-communist, any time josh says anything: yes. YES!! I CAN RADICALIZE HIM!!!!!
Day 8 of posting on every mythical kitchen upload until Hotdog is a Sandwich is on YouTube
“Psychosexual clusterfluff”
I want that burger in and around my mouth RIGHT NEOW!!!
Day 7 of posting on every mythical kitchen upload until Hotdog is a Sandwich is on YouTube
@6:36 "heating up in what's called, like, a pot or whatever." Love ya, Josh 🤣🤣🤣 Always hilarious
Hello Mythical Kitchen, 🙏How are you? Your project inspired me so much, ❤ view my   just 👍 it, Dhanyabad, Fiblee Support Team.  🤠
Day 6 of posting on every mythical kitchen upload until Hotdog is a Sandwich is on YouTube
It’s like a train wreck. Horrible the whole way through but I couldn’t look away.
Day 5 of posting on every mythical kitchen upload until Hotdog is a Sandwich is on YouTube
I would be down to watch Shayne and Josh do "healthy" recipes. I think it would be fun seeing Josh use his chef brain to make health food tasty and Shayne learning new skills if Emily made an appearance now and then I wouldn't complain.
Should’ve thrown some ICEberg lettuce on there
Methinks he is jealous of the cool hats
Day 4 of posting on every mythical kitchen upload until Hotdog is a Sandwich is on YouTube
Josh and Shayne give Gandalf and Frodo vibes.
listen. josh is infinately more chaotic on this channel than he is when he appears on smosh and i did not anticipate that and i am LIVING for it
This burger sounds sort of interesting! :)
Damien and Trevor V Shayne and Josh Cook off
I think i Just found my role model 🤣
your korean pronunciations were so good Josh! 잘하셨어요~
Love a heavyweights reference
Honestly I love steak tartar and I am craving this so much right now
Someone send this to Gordon
Anytime I see Josh laughing after tasting his creations, I like to believe he is thinking 'how the hell did I pull this off?'
BURGER BUT COLD
I've never heard someone speak so fast for so long before
I want an eat it or yeet it where Josh makes Garrets greatest hits but fancy/Josh-ified.
Please go on smosh eat or yeet, and be the food maker the theme being: eat it or yeet it recipes but good/made by a real chef
yes, I know the phrase 'peanut gallery' but the way Josh said it cracks me the F*** up
you're not far off with how people from wisconsin sound like, sincerely, someone from wisconsin
I feel like josh and damien have very similar chaotic energy.  Josh should host How much in the world money is it does it cost for an episode.
Milk bean, do a beef tartare as a big bite!
Vishnu an indian god of protection? Totes forgive you for the cow murder and consumption.
Have you seen the Mr. Bean episode where he accidentally orders tar tar?  You have to watch it.
13:39 definitely not Vishnu, you are making a beef tartar burger lol
That's a lot of blinking
Raw meat can contain parasites
Josh, we call it wildcat. And we like to smear it on little tiny pieces of rye bread.
Fancy mettbrötchen. Love it!
Is Josh just having a stroke?
Funny hat = toké
In North Dakota our local grocery store used to sell Tiger Meat and old men would eat it with Head Cheese and Rita crackers. Disgusting.
Why does this actually look kinda good and why do I actually wanna try it??? (I’ve never had a chance to try raw beef or beef tartare, but it’s really reminding me of raw spicy tuna and now I’m hungry)
I love beef tartare. Lemon juice, soy sauce, pepper, ginger, spring onions, olive oil, paprika and a hint of mustard is my go to
As a Wisconsinite, You sir were very right. I refuse to give up raw beef and onions. Pry it from my cold dead hands.   Also huge props cause yes we all definitely sound like that 😂🧀
Heavy Weights quote YEEESSSS
Me waiting for garret to comment
I adore how often josh references heavyweights lol
"Don't ask me about food safety," the chef says
This is the weirdest cooking show I've ever seen and I love it
Ain't no freaking way
Texaconsinite here: cannibal sandwiches are a thing (ground beef on rye bread with salt) and are disgusting.
The borderline between a genius and a madman is a line drawn into water.
lol Do it to it Lars.I love me some Heavyweights.
I’ve never seen a single one of these videos but this is just Cooking With ADHD™️ and I’m living for it
I know Shayne is apart of Smosh, but can we please have him more on Mythical Kitchen!? I just love Josh and Shayne’s relation!
Should have added some type of pickle
I actually really want to try this
Josh is the Bob Ross of cooking.
Mythical Kitchen AND Smosh???  That is the way to end the day!
I don't want to eat this but the raw egg yoke does make me concerned
Dude, just buy a double double from INNO and leave it in the fridge overnight lol And eat it cold 👌 All that condensed umami so goooood 👌
Don't know about that, you should NEVER eat raw chicken.
Give me more MK x Smosh crossovers! I want to watch Josh and Shayne interact in a kitchen.
I am clearly thinking of a different ice cream… right?
I don’t think Vishnu would forgive you for eating raw beef.
I love telling people that I love beef tartar and then watching the horror in their face as I tell them that it’s raw meat.
The reason you can eat beef raw is because the microbes are generally found on the skin of the cow. So since the skin is removed you’re unlikely to consume these. As long as the beef is kept safely and only placed on sanitary surfaces, you should be fine. When you have mince meat though, that can have small portions of skin mixed into it, and microbes can become mixed in.
I feel disappointed that he didn't get the proper yoopernese accent
I don't really get the fear of raw beef, or (god forbid) pork. The stuff is perfectly safe, IF you keep to the appropriate standards. The only thing you should actually not eat raw is poultry, which is almost impossible to keep food safe.
Lmao... Perfect knock off BK slogan "Screw it.. make it your own"
I've never heard of Smosh but I might have to wash their food videos now.
8:45 think Shayne’s asking Josh on a date ☺️
spot on Shayne impression ngl 8:45
13:37  you called????
Most meat in western markets is safe parasite wise because it's been frozen at some point. Bacteria is the real thing to watch out for there's some nasty strains like E.coli and bacterium.
His name is not Garrett, it's MilkBean
“Don’t ask me about food safety”-Josh
My grandpa used to eat tiger sandwiches all the time
I’d like to know more about his Dorian Gray ice cream.
I didn’t know I needed 16:54 - 17:01, But I did.
As a Garrett the end of this episode made me sad XD
I would also be awesome if you brought back Food Fears and got Noah to go on it
I would love if you guys did more of this series in relation to Eat it or Yeet it. It would also be cool if some of the Smosh came on this channel as guests more
I NEED TO KNOW HOW OLD IS TREVOR
Don’t ask me about food safety.  That’s not my game. - CHEF Josh
I'm going to make this, is there a special kind of filet mignon I should buy so I don't poison myself?
Garrett here. I look up to you too josh. In all seriousness though it's kinda weird hearing my name so many times in one video. Love you guys! 🤣
The only way a burger could be good cold is if it's a dessert don't @ me
Garret needs a rival cooking show
Which god would be most likely to forgive us? 😂
As an iranian wtf is cucumber ice cream and believe me i have traveled the whole country 2 times and still didn't see it anywhere.😂
As a born and raised Wisconsinite: A) I have never heard of a Canabal or Tiger meat sandwich and B) do we really sound like that to other people?
I forgive you
Do it to it, Lars!  Excellent reference.  I'm with you.  I love you.
Do the TikTok then say "I am the sausage" deadpan, 10,000,000 views
Was that.... Stupid Matt Bradley from the Jenkins Town Posse?!
Josh is an idol of mine but probably younger lol. He cooks brilliant food but sounds like me when he cooks lol. Respect the process of becoming a chef but you can still be yourself. That works in soo many things
Tartare is CHOPPED beef, not grounded...
11:26 idk why but I love the way josh casually says "gross"
I can verify that this is a food tradition in Wisconsin.
I'd like to believe spork cam was a reference to brutalmoose.
I'm from Wisconsin and can confirm the Cannibal Sandwich thing. I would see it at any holiday for the longest time and I always thought it was so gross. My aunts would just put a lump of ground beef on a plate, cover it with onions and serve it with crackers. *shudder* so glad they don't do that anymore. No one ever got sick that I know of but it was still gross.
im from wisconsin ive never heard  for that raw sandwich you speak of josh
Nobody ever share this with Gordon ramsay
Hello, Molly, my old friend.
“Which god is most likely to forgive us” omg Josh is too powerful.
This proves that Garrett is a menace
Loki, the trickster god would be the one to most likely forgive you
Can we put bts in the thumbnail? A picture of shayne
After watching this I now greatly fear for the lives of Rhett, Link, and the Smosh Cast...
everyone mixes up whether you should with whether you can...   Worked for a fish monger for nearly a decade.. everyone kept asking "can I eat this salmon raw?" and I would reply much the same "you can eat anything raw, it's whether you should or not" and then proceeded to explain there is inherent risk in eating anything raw but there are things you can do to limit that risk.. which are:  1) fresh. fresher is better, and if you have a chain of logs with temps and conditions a long with sensors proving the product never reached above a certain temp, even better and in some cases freezing the product will help as well, though it will not fix food that has already been contaminated, reached certain temps or is alrdy off. 2) preparation in a sanitary environment is mandatory 3) eat immediately after preparing or very soon after
I believe you don't add it in all so you don't break the emulsion or yeah curdle eggs.
Josh makes stupid dish and has a nervous breakdown
Tartar for the win.  Take the red pill.
Saying jaywalking isn’t safe is such a city thing. I’m not gonna walk ten minutes to a cross walk with maybe one car every five to walk ten minutes back. In cities yes but you also have crosswalks everywhere, we only have them because of the school where I grew up. And I think we had three.  Edit three crosswalks, one school.
Yo, Was that a Heavyweights movie reference at 6:20? Nice!
6:11 Bro, you okay Josh? Very odd phrasing there.
Being a garrett who works in a kitchen any of these videos that mention garrett from smosh feels very personal for whatever reason when they say garrett
The meat to bun ratio is honestly more disgusting (to me) than the raw part.
At 12:39 he turned into bdylanhollis for a second - when he tastes the crazy food and realises it tastes good 😆
never expected a bts reference from the mythical kitchen... *gains even more respect for them*
Burger but cold? Burger King?
Vishnu, a Hindu god would not be cool with eating beef. For raw hamburger, best go with Odin.
I wanna be best friends with Josh
I like that trait about Garret too. The man off psychological terror
Cooking raw beef and nana like, yep a Hindu god’s the one
I had ketchup ice cream for Halloween once and I still have PTSD
Milk Bean!!!!
4:02 totally missed the opportunity to say Paris-sites
a chilled bao sesame bun would have been perfect for the chill theme.
If you use raw pork, it's a fancy Mettbrötchen.
I think Josh should be made into an archer character, it would make the show  epic
I came to the comments to say that you can eat Beef raw* while you can't eat pork or chicken raw because of parasites, basically. Cow meat doesn't get the parasite infestation that pork meat can, and chicken meat can get salmonella very easy. The asterisk is because ground meat of any kind, unless freshly ground and then eaten, is never safe raw because it's a perfect environment for bacteria.
"Let's do it to it Lars."" I quote this probably more than I should and almost no one gets the reference. I'm not sure if it's a good thing that Josh is the one I have to go to for my quote validation, but I am happy I am not alone.
13:37   As someone raised Hindu, I dont think Vishnu would "forgive" especially since it is a beef dish :P
You can't just tell us about the bacon pancake ice cream and not do a video of that
I love how i intermitten fast in order to cut my weight and return to my best like physically fit form again. But on the days i don't eat i just binge Mythical Kitchen. It's like doing NNN but strictly watching certain videos. I think i like torturing myself. That or i just can't stay away from Josh.
“Let’s do it to it Lars!”  It’s the Heavy weights reference for me
Look up Filet Americain and make your own.  Chuck it on a fresh baked baguette (royally). Add diced raw onions and slices of hard-boiled egg.  finish with salt and pepper. enjoy <3
Vegan recipes please‼️
In Germany raw meat sandwiches are pretty normal. Look up Mettbrötchen
…is josh ok?
Josh told us how the burger is made, but he kind of also told us how the sausage is made
I feel the rest of them are sitting in corner locked in the room with him in terror
So... this maybe an over simplification... in Hindu Mythology the Cow is viewed as a Symbol of several gods and one of the major gods, Krishna, was a protector and herder of cattle, hence why cattle are not kept for their meat in India but rather for their milk. Krishna is also considered to be an avatar of Vishnu... you are eating raw cow and asking the one of if not the highest deity of an entire culture that eschews the consumption of beef to forgive you for what you have made. You might have better luck with another deity.
Let’s go JOSH!
pov chef telling people food safety isn't his game... i am done lol
Josh: handling raw beef  Also josh: you think this Hindu god would forgive me for my transgressions?
In Belgium this is just called a 'boterham met préparé' and it is literally the most common thing to have for lunch, breakfast, in between. Bread, americain préparé (beef mince with the sauce), slice of cheese.
Smooth Idiocracy reference Josh.
The Wisconsin joke genuinely made me laugh. Coming from a Wisconsinite. Because its pretty true
how did i misread smosh as josh asdf
Tempering is a proper cooking technique but this is a brave ass way to do it, generally you add way less at the begging while constantly whisking even as you add the milk, once you have half in then you chuck it into the pot
JOSH SAID "DO IT TO IT LARS" QUOTING BEN STILLER IN HEAVYWEIGHTS WHICH IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIE AND I SAY IT ALL THE TIME AND NO ONE GETS IT. JOSH IS MY JEWISH MALE SPIRIT ANIMAL
We call it “wildcat” and…. It’s delicious I can’t help it! -Wisconsinite
From the sound of this recipe, I think pickles or a relish would have been a good addition.
Big both!
So I feel like this would be an amazing recipe if you just make it hot instead of cold lol
I adore beef tartare and carpaccio, they’re very popular in Europe but the US seems to have a weird relationship with raw meat and eggs
I literally drooled watching Shayne take a bite
please make raw meat icecream
Try flipping your next burger upside down before you eat it. I don’t know why but, it WILL taste sooooo much better! Give it a try. Let me know what you think. Does a burger actually taste better flipped upside down or nah?
"You will live to see man-made horrors beyond comprehension" doesn't begin to cover beef tartar burger with mayo-esque ice cream on top
How did you not wind up on Gordon Ramsay’s new show “next level kitchen” ?! What a sham of a show that is without you
I miss the smosh from my childhood
You guys should do like a day with Josh, were we see the bizarre meals of Josh in an average day
Josh saying that I can eat raw beef is such a dangerous thing. I love raw meat and now I'm worried that I'm only going to eat uncooked beef from now on
As a Wisconsinite, that accent was scarily accurate. Also, Cannibal Sandwiches are actually f*ing delicious. You might get E Coli and die, but on the other hand... they taste really damn good because it's meat.
I'm always shocked about the fact that these videos don't usually breach a million views. Josh is just such a fun guy and his videos are a good mix of stupid and genuinely good cooking, feels like a recipe for success (hah). Just wish more people enjoyed them like we do
Also can you make these as a pop up?
Jaywalking is a crime to sell cars
Milk Bean’s Son: Milk Beansprout
Okay but what about Burger with Malic Acid and Fish Food French Fries? I could see french fries with Old Bay spice but I can't figure out how to make a sour burger.
when Josh took that first bite, and started folding and laughing... I thought it was over,  I thought it was his official decent into madness.
I think europe has stricter food safety regulations so eating risky stuff there is prob safer than here
As a lifelong Wisconsinite, can confirm that’s how we sound😂 Cannibal sandwiches are more of like a nowhere Wisconsin type thing. Near the bigger cities it’s shockingly less popular. Myself, never had one, will only have one if Josh made it
Anyone see the avocado sticker 😂
“Somebody stop me!” No Josh! Giving you a channel was an amazing idea! You do you my boy!
That's the best wisconsinite impersonation ever
That Bangtan shout out - 😏💜
A strawberry isn't a berry, it's a MULTIPLE FRUIT! Wow, Josh! Look at you using fruit trivia I learned in Plant Taxonomy :)
I am from Wisconsin and I can confirm that Tiger Meat is a common snack for card parties or small-town thanksgivings. We put it on saltine crackers, it's amazing
I'd love to see Gordon Ramsey react to this
I love how Josh asks which god would forgive him but then names one from a religion in which the cow is sacred!
HIS NAME IS MILKBEAN!
in germany we call ist Hackepeter
you making something hackepeter
Only Josh
fancy mettbrötchen
Loved the Heavyweights reference!
Well raw ground Beef with onions in a bun is a classic  at least in germany
Love tiger meat!
You should've put the custard in a plastic bag and done the ice with salt so itd be ice-cream fast
WHEN MAKING TARTAR EVERYTHING MUST BE SUPER SURGICAL CLEAN OR YOU WILL GET SICK OUT BOTH ENDS
How do they keep flying in the face of God with some of these dishes and manage to stick the landing?
And this was unfortunately his last mythical kitchen episode 😢 R.I.P mythical chef sir. Can we get an "F" in the comments  for our fallen chef  Josh.
the spork cam angle really just puts into perspective how short shayne is
Smosh and Mythical Kitchen podcast collab where Shayne talks about his favorite pizza place or “it is monday” banana absurdity in the context of food instagram trends and then Josh makes actual food commentary
wait wait- I saw that episode of eat it or yeet it. But I didn't realize till now, that it was you.
Petition for Josh to get a cool hat
Why hasn't Josh prepared all the food for an eat it or yeet it yet? This needs to happen.
Yep. A New Years Wisconsin staple.
You can anything at least once
I need an episode of mk where Garrett and Josh make dishes for eat it or yeet it  then an episode of eat it or yeet it where the cast of smosh have to eat the dishes and guess who made it
I'm irrationally happy that Josh referenced a lone from the movie "Heavyweights" in this episode. It gave me a dopamine rush.
An American making a "Mettbrötchen" ? I am curious
Can we please get a cooking show with Shayne and Josh? I would watch that every day
Why did you give Wisconsin a southern leaning accent when we sound like Canadians? 😂 You went the wrong direction.
You did great son
Respectfully, I want Josh to have my babies 🥲
What if you use likeA cheddar cheese powder mix or flavoring like something that you would use for like popcorn or some thing and added it to cream cheese so it would stay creamy longer for the cheese part I don’t know maybe I’m silly just a thought?
I liked the "Heavyweights" reference.
I love listening to Josh unveiling the madness that is his mind. It is both relaxing and invigorating at the same time.
“Whisk constantly” sounded a lot like “Wisconsin-ly”
THE “i need it” WAS SO GENUINE 🤣
Mythical Stewie
Totally forgot the ICEBERG lettuce
Should have diced not ground the beef better texture … but fun none the less
swallow it!
Where’s Shane?
does josh have covid?
I'm from Wisconsin, my grandfather and uncle both made raw hamburger sandwiches for lunch when they went hunting. I never understood
"Wisterché"
Shouldn’t food safety be the game , of the head cook of a production company?
So you’re saying you didn’t milk the cow for that cheese you grated. Pathetic
Matt Bradley!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
RIP cheese in the ice bath at 8:57
Oh a cannibal sandwich with salt, pepper and raw onions on rye!! So good!!! I'm from Wisconsin 😁
I am from Wisconsin and I know about 15 people who talk like that.
This is basically just fancy Mettbrötchen with ice cream, and I want it in my mouth
I feel like a mini slider version would be amazing
I think Shane is trying to ask Josh out...
13:36 Yup..
Oh okay, not going to see what Garett thinks about it. Alright, sheesh.
As someone from Wisconsin I can say that you're not entirely wrong.
"Burger but cold" or like we say in germany "Mettbrötchen"
A strawberry is a psueodocarp.
I appreciate the Heavyweights reference more than you could know!
As a person from Wisconsin I can say that Josh's impression was spot on
Never will I ever make this, but this is stoned-cold genius!
I love josh just for that libertarianism joke xD
I live for Josh's chaos
At 0:10 - doesn't it though Josh?
All I can think is that Damian must have been so disappointed he didn’t get one
Josh when he talks excited w his mouth full sounds like Charlie Day
Lmao! The Shayne impression! 🤣🤣🤣
Matt Bradley?
nobodies seen more butts than you uncle tony
Apologize for advocating for the consumption of raw meat
Excellent Heavy Weights reference.
He should have used raw horse meat.
Mythical kitchen living up to its name LOL
C'mon Josh, now we need an actual beef tartar icecream.
Wait Smosh is still a thing?
Dude. Josh. Your triceps are out of control.
this is.. somehow, the perfect amount of unhinged and coherent. amazing video
Josh, every one should love you, because you are amazing.
As somebody from wisconsin...yes
if he doesnt do "burger but cold" im rioting edit: HYEEEEAHH BABEY
Ive actually had tartare with dijon ice cream...
that honestly, was the best impression of Shayne that i've ever seen
Smosh... < Josh
omg 2 episodes until the 100th episode
I once made three flavors of ice cream for a youth ministry challenge. I wanted the theme of sushi in ice cream form. So I made soy sauce ice cream, wasabi ice cream, and salmon ice cream, with seaweed added to the salmon one. I presented it with a scoop of each in a dish garnished with some fresh salmon, a seaweed crisp, and wasabi on the rim of the glass. It was horrifying, but also surprisingly satisfying to actually get the flavors right.
Who is Smosh?
I can't listen to you I have to mute you because you talk more and faster than any woman I know.
Now we need a Will It Cold GMM episode
Surgeon general of Wisconsin doesn't let people eat those burgers but let people eat 5lbs of cheese at every meal 🤣
Whenever I saw a meat grinder...  All I can imagine is that barbie and ken in the grinder...
My kind of kitchen alchemy. You are the best Josh 🖤
I’m not sure how Vishnu would feel about the whole beef thing.
Need a eat it or yeet it: Josh cooks edition.
"barb-acu sauce" - Josh 2022
Anyone else wonder how that meat grinder gets cleaned..?
"Phychosexual clusterfluff"... That's a way to put it I guess.
Raw beef can definitely be safe, if the butcher was careful and it's still generally clean when you start to cut it up. The diseases show up when someone handles the food wrong, getting dirt and nasty bacteria all over it. That's why raw chicken and ground beef are not safe. Chicken is treated awfully in most industrial settings, and who knows what's gone into the beef before it was ground up
An eat it or yeet it with Garrett and Josh collaborate on the food would be hilarious
“Which god is most likely to forgive us, Vishnu?” Isn’t that a Hindu god? Which is popular in India where the worship cows? I think that’s probably one of the worst choices to ask for forgiveness from.
Lol.... Josh is so proud!
I desperately want Ben and Jerry's to make your Ice Cream Condiment.
But why
Preciate that Heavy Weights reference there Josh.
Here's an idea for ya now that I know you have an ice cream machine. Credit goes to futurama, the ice cream manwich sandwich!
AHGASSI GOPCHANG! Where my fellow armies at?
We need more “middle fingers to god”, “what have we done” content from the Mythical Kitchen! And Smosh aka sister wives, crossover action 🔥
#50 on trending?! Congrats Josh!
I see you, Heavyweights reference at 6:20.
They need to wait 2 hours after consumption to see if they'd get sick or not.   That's raw, dude.
the way he said barbecue sauce sounded like JonTron XD
Funny thing, I J-Walked before watching this video.
Do it to it Lars! My siblings and I say that all of the time and no one else ever gets the reference!
This is the first time I’ve seen Josh outside of Smosh videos and I think I love him. Came here for Shayne and accidentally watched the whole thing because of his energy and humour. Great video.
4:08 did he just call it wirstirshir it’s pronounced wus-ter-sh
what happened to the colors in the transition graphics?
Josh, you drink too much.
You dont want to add the creme anglaise cold because you want the heat to help quickly disolve the sugar in the mixture, and not leave any graininess. if you added it cold, you would then need to heat on a double boiler to get rid of the grainy consistency of the sugar.
"This is a fancy French dish!" As if that somehow makes it not disgusting. I have to side with the Peanut Gallery on this one.
This made me feel weird as my name is garrett
Should of added a egg yolk
Where's Emily? Bring her back!
Strawberries are aggregate accessory fruits.
I'm so glad Josh was given a platform 🤣🤣🤣🤣
No one cares get off the internet
I kinda miss the old design themes. The colors popped. Still a great episode 😄
Until the point he made the condiment as an icecream, which i understand as a cooling factor to the raw meat, its just like a german Mett-Brötchen or as he said tartar in a bun^^
"Which God do you think is most likely to forgive us, Vishnu?" Might be my favorite quote from this show?
Speaking of chefs and parasites. One wonders if The CDC has a portable Bio- Containment unit held exclusively for Andrew Zimmerman.  Like they would roll it into the airport every time he makes landing after an overseas assignment.  Zimmerman has BIG "Akira" potentialhood. JK
man those guys over at smosh are all really fake and annoying
Wir lieben unseren Hackepeter oder Mett in Deutschland.. The name is derived from Low German mett for "chopped pork meat without bacon", or Old Saxon meti for "food". It is also known as Hackepeter (Northern Germany, Eastern Germany and Berlin). It consists of minced pork meat, normally sold or served seasoned with salt and black pepper, regionally also with garlic or caraway, and eaten raw. It is also permitted to add chopped onion, in which case and it is known as Zwiebelmett (onion Mett). Legally, German Mett is not allowed to contain more than 35% fat.[1] Unless pre-packaged, the German Lebensmittelhygiene-Verordnung ("food hygiene/health directive") permits mett to be sold only on the day of production.
Team up with Garret and make the worlds worst eat it or yeet it!!! Take smosh to the line and then push them over the line!
JDP
Josh, I was here for this the whole time. The entire time, it sounded fire to me
I NEEDED GARRETS REACTION 😭
in germany we have something called "Mett" which is basically just raw pork mince, though theres a turkey variant, too. you typically eat it with onions and salt and pepper on your bread or roll. so its not really a shock id say. the ice cream feels a little off though :D
I heard him yell from the sidelines and I realized: I miss Trevor. Give us more Trevor (I really hope I’m spelling it right) I miss him and I miss learning the best way to cook normal stuff cause I’m a big boy who never learned cooking and feelings and I look up to josh for both of those but I also love Trevor cause he represents my generation
"Don't ask me about food safety, that's not my game."
so someone needs to show this to George Motz the  Burger Scholar from First we Feast
I've had beef tartare exactly once, and it was once too many times. I could not get past the texture at all.
Please don't make tartare from supermarket beef. The same reason why you shouldn't make sushi from supermarket fish. Raw meat or fish is almost totally safe as long as it's eaten pretty much the day it was harvested. Supermarket meat can be killed weeks before the time of purchase, more than enough time for bacteria to grow on the surface. You can still eat your beef or lamb rare at that point since the bacteria doesn't permeate. If you want to make tartare, speak to your local butcher to get your hands on fresh meat.
Listening to Josh say Korean words is so bizarre to me. This is not the first time, but this is definitely the most he has spoken at once. You can hear the inflections of English in the pretty solid Korean pronunciation. It's interesting... He's saying the words right, but the way he says them is wrong. English emphasizes a specific syllable, and Korean stays pretty consistent throughout the sentence, so you can really notice Josh's speech patterns and habits...
I’ve never eaten raw beef. In fact…I’ve only been eating meat for the past…maybe 3 years. But the fact that I recognize Josh as an artist and can see how psyched he is about this…I would def look forward to trying it. I hope he keeps pushing the boundaries. I believe he could potentially become one of the most versatile chefs we’ve seen in a long time.
16:49 Tell me Shayne does not sound like Frito from Idiocracy
I was not ready to hear a phrase so raw as "Which god is most likely to forgive us?" from a cooking show
Bruh you put ketchup in ice cr-
And also, it’s really douchy and ignorant of you to mock being a Surgeon General
Mythical has been kinda running out of fire ideas lately and have been kinda stupid. Also, a tartare burger? Really
I actually want to try this now
Uh, that is beef in those patties, right? Then I don't think Vishnu is the right God to forgive you. I would go for a Norse or Greek God, like Frey or Dionysus. They have a more liberal view on eating cows.
I would try that 😝
Fact gordan would have a couple of choice words for this
I live in Wisconsin, but I've only heard of the cannibal sandwich once. Never even had it and have no intention personally.
I want to eat that
Life is dynamite!
burger but cold is my favorite internet joke of 2021. Unfortunately none of my meat friends are as terminally online as I am and I can't express it to people in the real world.
I've totally made ranch soft serve. I think josh would love it.
That’s gnarly 😬 can you actually eat that? So weird lol 😆
“YeAh ThAt’S rIgHt GaRrEtT”
Now I want a burger at 1AM. Cooked.
I think I need to go to confession just for watching this affront to nature
Love the crossover!
I'm new here. Just subscribed and watched a few videos... I'm the only one who have to check the speed of the video cause Josh talks way to fast?
bar-be-Q! Sauce
his convos with shayne seem fun
Unexpected rocket power reference
Im from Wisconsin. had a cannibal sandwich. It aight UWU
bacon bits in tartare sounds really freaking good, I wouldn’t mind eating this
Anyone else want Josh and Shayne to kiss? No…just me? Ok
Tar tar should not exist.
Never thought I'd hear Josh quoting the 1995 Ben Stiller classic, "Heavyweights", but here we are.
Holy crap someone else has heard of cannibal sandwiches, lol
my brain cant process that’s how beef tartare is made
13:37 I don't know much about religion but aren't cows sacred in India?
“Do it to it Lars”, did he really just sprinkle a Heavyweights reference in and think no one would notice?  I see you Josh. I see you, and I appreciate you.  And I fully expect you have Nutella filled Twinkies hidden in your bedpost. 🤷🏻‍♂️
“This is the payoff of the bit.”  “Well thank you Josh.”
Josh definitely makes me laugh so much every time I watch 😂 10/10 Josh is the vibe lmao
Please make the Cajun McChicken  for a Past Food video?
LOLOL I'm from Wisconsin and of COURSE I sound like that 😂
bruh
The "Heavy Weights" reference excited me more than it probably should have
The world needs more Josh and Shayne collabs
You know you're getting old when you see Smosh but then don't know who tf this guy is.....
Maggie's "Yeah!" was 100 percent *Small child showing you something they find interesting* voice and I love it so much.
I would love to see an Eat-it-or-Yeet-It, Josh cooks everything edition
Now I want an episode where Josh makes to ice cream that's too decadent even for him.
I love that Josh quoted Heavyweights.
Milkbean got shown up!
Nothing can top the absolute concept that is burger but cold.
Dionysus approves all enjoyment and gluttony
oh Josh... we love you.
Accent was a little off, but the cannibal sandwich is right. Had them at Xmas dinner this year. Rye bread open face sandwich (or crackers) with thin sliced raw onions.
After the line, "nothing stops it from going down your throat" my pc crashed I think that's what they call a sign
so josh, that decidant ice cream recipe when?
Can we put BTS in the thumbnail? No, okay, Shayne will do. Lolol
This was awesome and made me want a burger
Hopefully Rhett and link will do a redemption of the whole show of smosh. It's straight horrible minus Shane and Damian
I'd like to see an episode with Josh and Garrett working together! Or competing
In Belgium I had a sandwich called Americain that is ground beef tartare on baguette. The places I had it at kept everything at room temp,  it was amazing.
Just awesome and hilarious! thanks
We need more Mythical/Smosh crossovers!
I watched this episode on smash and it's a  Meme 2 the smash crew now lol . Let's see what u got Josh.  O boy ok let's just watch lol. Ice cream ?. I was  Hoping you asked  Shane  beforehand if he was cool with eating a raw Burger and he was get the yeet bucket ready or does he eat it 🤔. Omg Josh has weird thumbs on that plate freaks me out lol. Shane is the man! he eats malic acid so was it really good ? Lol.
Weirdly the only thing that gave me pause was that I don't like Thousand Island dressing. Not the raw meat, not the ice cream on a savory dish, not even the weird textures the cold bun and cheese disk would have. I think thousand island is gross.
I saw Shayne and jumped the like button. Josh and Shayne is a great energy.
This made me think of cheeseburger egg rolls from Disney. I’ve made them from home a few times. Definitely good.
this is one side of clams from being Least Kosher Ever
josh........... why...........................
I don't know Josh that kind of looks uncooked
That was a wild idea!
How to explain "synergy" to millenials
That was pretty damn interesting, Josh! Question: have you eaten Kibbeh nayyeh before? I’m like 4% Lebanese and love it!
Am I the only one who'd legit wanna try this? If I had the skills for it.
Please make a cookbook :(
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates—🎈
I'm a Wisconsinite and my 91 year old Grandmother enjoys cannibal sandwiches occasionally to this day. It's just like tartar... keep the beef as cold as possible. Nevertheless... its going to be a hard no from me, canine.
Please recreate Doritos Jacked Ranch Dipped HotWing flavor. Like what you did with taki powder
Smosh has so few viewers compared to subscribers. It’s almost like everyone subscribed for these 2 funny guys who aren’t there anymore.
Sweet Heavyweights reference.
My boyfriend and I have been waiting for months for the day when Josh makes the Eat it or Yeet foods instead of Garrett and is a total menace. Please make it happen!!
I am so annoyed that Josh leaves like an 1/8 of a cup of every ingredient in the bowls
Note to the editor: Could you please not randomly zoom in and out of the footage. Thank you.
This was everything I’ve ever wanted, pls recreate more Milk Bean dishes thank u
I know I'm in the minority but I absolutely hate Smosh, particularly Shane.
never enjoyed nausea so much.
This reminds me of the shitpostcalligrapher, "If left unattended I may eat raw beef"
I wanna see Shayne in the kitchen with Josh. Maybe for an episode of fancy fast food? Their comedy styles bounce off of one another a lot.
6:21 Heavyweights reference game out of this world my guy
Entertaining for a non-foodie. But you lost me at Stephen Colbert and ben & jerry's.
My friends are telling me to tell you to unpost this video, and never do this again, the term "for the love of God, Why?" was uttered. I think you are a genius mixed with unbrideled creativity so don't listen to them
I'm gonna need that bacon pancake ice cream recipe
Please god make a cooking video of Josh and Shayne, I BEG OF YOU
putting shayne in the thumbnail got me to watch, well that and the title...
Seeing these two channels coke together in episodes like this is like watching a Disney channel crossover
Do Rhett & Link know that food safety is not Josh's game?
Vishnu is hindu, hindus dont eat beef, so probably every God but that one would be apt to forgive 😂
Not sandwiches. We Wisconsinites eat raw beef with onions and crackers. We're not animals.
Everything he said about Wisconsin and tiger meat is 100% true - certified Wisconsinite
I'm from Wisconsin! I knew people as a kid that did the raw sandwich, but my mom didn't let me try it. I've probably eaten close to 100 lbs of raw beef and lamb in my life now, and I'm fine mom!!
I love Eat or Yeet!!! My favourite Smosh series
YES iconic
i dont know if i'm just tired, but this is the least funny Josh has been since the channel started
"which god do you think would forgive us" is exactly what mythical kitchen is all about
LOL Wisconsin shoutout
Biggest crime is how he pronounces Worcestershire.  He's almost right except the last syllable, which is the easiest. It's the same as New Hampshire and Yorkshire.
Pseudocarp
Oh no no nooooo. Come to Wisconsin before you talk your sex shenanigans.  Do you realize how much we drink here?
If it weren’t for the horse radish I’d totally eat that.
As someone from Wisconsin, DON'T TELL ME NOT TO EAT MY CANNIBAL SANDWICHES.
I had ketchup ice cream in Japan, it’s great. I generally do not like ketchup normally.  Also from Wisconsin, can confirm all the comments on raw beef eating.
The bite face was totally "this is going to be so fu**ing groooo......Whaaaatttttt!?!"
It’s funny that in Belgium or the Netherlands we have a raw beef dish (like a you made) and call it Filet American.
Please make meaty ice creams
Supporting you with this fork. So.... Supporking?
Josh please come work for me.  I need you.  One day .. I'll totally fly you for real.  We'll make everything I make my food dreams come true
Dear Josh,   Ketchup ice cream exists.  :)
This absolutely churns my innards 🤢
Come on stupid Matt Bradley! We'll find you on the road following the Dead...or something.
Oh no.
"Which god do you think would be most likely to forgive us? Vishnu?" I died 🤣🤣
I remember cannibal sandwiches as a kid and they were great in the bar 😂
I would love to see Josh on the Try Guys without a recipe but he’s competing with the guys as well.
The graph must be made!
This reminds me of a food idea I had a while ago while eating pretzels. So basically when you have a savory pretzel you dip it in mustard. But what if you have a sweet pretzel, what do you dip that it? Exactly. Mustard ice cream.
"Don't ask me about food safety, that's not my game" Except. . . it kind of is. . .
We need to see Milk Bean's response to this.
I am from Wisconsin and we can definitely stop eating cannibal sandwiches whenever 😂 the old people love it
Is it just me or does Josh kinda seek meggy’s validation and kinda talk to her like she’s his mom
Am a Minnesotan living in Wisconsin, can confirm that it's how people in this state sound
The reference to Dorian Greys portrait... elite 👏🔥
I'm from Wisconsin and that is without a doubt exactly how we sound. Josh's impression was on point
This is genius
In Germany a popular breakfast dish is raw pork on a bun with onions
Eating a pistoleke with raw minced meat is rather traditional over here...
God who would forgive you-- Bacchus, because drunk people.
Oh man I would love it if Josh and Eat it or Yeet it collabed with a "Greatest Hits: Gourmet Edition"
"Which God do you think would be most likely to forgive us? Vishnu?"  Dionysus.
Wait... Is the description the crotch of the video? Thanks for opening my eyes Josh. lmao
I'd love to watch josh stream or play hard games
As a Wisconsin resident who's horrified of those sandwiches it pleases me someone else understands how dense these folks can be 🙏
ive been saying mayonnaise is a savoury ice cream/custard thank you
we need a video where Josh teaches the smosh cast how to cook a meal
When Josh began to eat it I immediately began to laugh and nearly choked on my cereal.
“Cheddar Cheese Freako” is what my middle school bully used to call me
Why does he have "psycho-sexual-cluster-fluff" on the back of his mind ready to go 😂😂😂
"Don't ask me about food safety, that's not my game." Is a very inspirational quote.
You need to do a Eat it or Yeet it episode
Senpai noticed me 🥺
I'm from Wisconsin 😭🤣
The mythical kitchen graph would look alot like the advancing technology over time graph.
Where I live one the ice cream companies made ketchup ice cream and sold it in grocery stores
we love shayne over here
Josh is giving off heavy cold medicine delirium Hope your okay buddy
I'm so Milwaukee it didn't occur to me that other people don't have open faced raw beef little sandwiches with onion, salt, and pepper on German rye for Christmas or NYE. Next you'll say people don't have pickled herring in wine sauce, either.
The height of the chef hat = the coolness of the dish
what... no raw bacon?!
yeah we do just eat raw beef sandwiches in wisconsin. mostly old people. it weirdly enough, is a christmas thing.
When the man with Grave Mouth likes your food you need to be cautious taking that as a positive
ty for the bts shoutout
This, JOKE, has went on for so damn long lmao
Was the “do it to it, Lars” a Heavyweights reference? ✨ and if so, why aren’t we best friends?
"Which god do you think is most likely to forgive us?"  I *would* say "Dionysus", but I'm not entirely sure that Josh isn't an aspect of Dionysus himself.
Josh needs to host eat it or yeet it!
9:25 Wisconsin-ly
This better be the precursor to recreating the Try Guys worst food crimes they have created...particularly that onion "cinnamon" roll
can we get ordinary sausage on this show?
Back when I was in  high school and college -- when dinosaurs roamed the earth -- the Camellia Grill on S. Carrollton Ave. in New Orleans had a Cannibal Burger. Been there, done that. Unfortunately, it's no longer on their menu. S'pose legal stuff kicked in over the years... Wait...was it ever really ON the menu? Or am I merely having a windowpane flashback???
I want to see josh in a comically tall chef hat
I love how they set out to make something nasty and it ends up be ing the fanciest thing
I have never heard anyone equate eating raw meat to Jay Walking. Well, there’s a first time for everything.
This made me so happy!
I don't watch Smosh, so this may already be a thing, but Shane is totally Dax Shepard in Idiocracy.
barBUhhQueue sauce
Josh should bring back "Links in my pants"
"Someone's gotta stop me..." "...what have we done?!"
Make a runza fancy
My name is Garrett, and some of these conversations Josh is having were kind of weird for me.
Josh: "Which God do you think would be most likely to forgive us? Vishnu?" Me: Bruh, you made this outta cow. Vishnu's pissed. You could go to any other pantheon, and find one more likely to forgive you. Try Ababinili.
As someone from Wisconsin, I've heard of cannibal sandwiches but have never had it
"dreams become food" nightmares are also dreams.
The unfortunate news about raw meat ice cream: Japan has horse meat tartare ice cream.
I’m from Wisconsin and I’m both offended and amazed by the things said
And also this channel proves that there is so much food that goes to waste because white people wanna be like “should we????” When thousands scream NO
beef tartare makes me laugh every time I see it after watching an IG post of someone making it and then reading the comments are %90 of people going "It's Raw"  I'm like that what beef tartare is people LOL,
BURGER BUT COLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Idk why but this channel has become the equivalent of Epic Meal Time, and at least EMT was Canadian and donated extra food to houseless folk.
I hate they took away the dislike button before this video. The dislike button is made for this video
I saw he title of this episode and I got so excited.
As a German person from southeastern Wisconsin I will confirm that the cannibal sandwich is a thing. Just rye or white bread, fresh high quality ground beef, and some raw onions. Voila! Generally just eaten on holidays and in particular Christmas. It definitely is not as popular today as it was 50 years ago though. It's been superceded by other specialty foods such as Ma Baensch herring. Eat and drink responsibly folks... Or should I say Wisconsinably! 😁
I gross my kids out by eating fresh raw hamburger all the time. I'd definitely be up for trying this, at least once. I'm not sure I could deal with the different textures involved, however. This was definitely an interesting one.
😜☝🎟💫
Because Olivia and Damien are into food, it would be interesting to see them in the kitchen with Josh at some point.
As a Wisconsinite I can confirm that cannibal sandwiches are a thing.  Raw ground beef, raw white onion, and black pepper on slices of bread.  Where you get your beef is a big part of whether or not you get sick
Yukhoi
Josh really asked for a Hindu God’s forgiveness while handling BEEF…
Would pay for that!
My new favorite thing is the random bts references that I seem to find on pretty much every chanel I watch (no matter how unrelated)
They should make a couple burgers that are different flavors and colors like the Krabby patties in SpongeBob HDHDJSKNSNSN
I loved everything about this episode, thank you XD Also, I'd love to see Garrett react to that burger, too.
I would love to see Josh make the food for Eat it or Yeet it for Smosh, and then have a video on this channel explaining how he did it all
I just started watching Try Not to Laugh last weekend and was thinking we need a Shayne and Josh collab? Get those strong boys together haha.
You know someone is weird when Shayne of all people is visibly confused at the absurdity of that person's creation.
Dang, I really want to taste this one!
Why was ranch ice cream not brought up, does josh even like ranch?
I’ve been bingeing old smosh videos for days now. I NEEDED THIS!!! 10/10 ❤️
but why...
can you please make cool ranch doritos dust and put it in a dish or make some fries or something that it would be good on
"cuz we're dumb but we make good food"   mythical kitchen's other catch phrase after "dreams become food"
I can’t jaywalk cause I’m in a chair, I can jayroll tho😂
I was kind of expecting Shayne to be Josh's helper in the kitchen. Other than that let down, great video as usual
Much like seeing that Babish guy, I see Smosh and I just skip over it. Not what I am looking for here RN, I will be back for the next one.
Lol, ol' milkbean got out classed here, and I'm here for the drama
I just wish Josh would do an episode of Chopped!
Damn i wanted Smosh people in this video WTF :(
bUrGeR bUt CoLd
Shayne and Josh need there own show it’s gold whenever there together
The great Cthulhu welcomes your madness.
Korean pear slaw on top of that burger would be amazing!!!
BarbaQue sauce lol
The custody battle over Shayne we didn't know we needed.
In Germany they do a dish with raw minced Pork called Mett. It is specially made and used within a day to keep it healthy :P
I thought one of the Smosh bros were called Anthony? Am I crazy?
Did I just hear a Heavyweights reference!!? I'm so happy.
I love Josh for making a fry sauce ice cream and I am also living for his chaotic energy creating this cursed masterpiece
You should get a random person on set to eat some of the madness you’ve created.
Call me crazy or whatever, but I prefer cooked meat.  Also, as a Wisonsite, I resent that remark! I don't care for cannibal sandwiches!
Where’s Trevor been?
Let’s go spork his ALL?
I love all the Smosh and Mythical collabs, lately.  More, please.  👍
Hollandaise ice cream needs to happen!
I love my cannibal sandwiches, though it's more like a spread of the meat on squares of rye bread. Add raw onions, salt, & pepper!
not "cluster fluff"
Mythical Smosh is a new era
I never knew strawberries weren't berries but instead a ᵏᵉʳᶠᵃᶜᵗᶦᵈ
I can hear faint music in the background and it's distracting.
This is every holiday meal in Wisconsin condensed into a single burger. Cheese, raw beef with the fixings, and ice cream? Milwaukee Burger wishes they could.
Just this weekend my grandpa was eating cannibal sandwiches (our family calls it raw dog), indeed, I am from Wisconsin. 😅 I don't mind liver paste, but I will not eat raw ground beef. 🥺🥩🧅
I remember Josh guest-starring on Eat it or Yeet it as one of my favorite episodes of that show.  Nice job perfecting/elevating this "fearsome food crime".
You could say that Josh and Garrett have got beef
Mythical Kitchen and Smosh should collaborate on an eat it or yeet it. The Mythical Kitcheneers and Garrett work together and make a video for Mythical Kitchen, and then Smosh plays Eat it or Yeet It on their channel with everything made from the first video
I need Brian David Gilbert’s reaction to that absolutely foul ice cream
You are gonna get sick doing this lol
I saw ICE CREAM and was so worried that he was putting vanilla ice cream on the burger and then it turned out to have savory ingredients and I honestly think that’s worst
AMAZING EPISODE
This was so hard to watch and yet I couldn’t look away.
pls do more of this i want to see jackie's bug pie
That is the only burger that I've ever thought looked appetizing
Josh’s ability to just take a good idea and make it… good(?) is fascinatingly inspiring.
In Germany we call a cold hamburger "Frikadellenbrötchen".
@Smosh @Josh is sister wives a Wheel of Time reference???
Where is the Shayne impression!?
After watching today’s gmm, I diagnose Josh with daddy issues
"Which God would be most likely to forgive us? Vishnu?" - Josh while making a raw beef burger I highly doubt that 😅
Josh you make me hungry. The food looks good too :P .
This is one of those things I want to try it by the same time like: but maybe not.
If I had an ice cream machine I'd make this just to try it out...
It´s a fancy Mettbrötchen ^^
The "Heavyweights" reference makes me so happy.   "Do it to it, Lars!" "It is my honor, Tony!"
Looks good to me
"which god do you think would be most likely to forgive us?" You can always count on josh to ask the real questions
i think dionysis would be down with his, and i'm a bit surprised he didn't come to mind for you
Fantastic. Don't let anyone stop your chaos lol. Your wit and intelligence make my day!
"DO IT TO IT LARS!" best movie ever. Ben Stiller was the champ
Strawberries are an aggregate fruit
You are sister wives to the landlord of your building?
BTS being mentioned on Good Mythical Kitchen is *chefs kiss
Oh no Josh, Vishnu will be the God that's most mad at you.
*Oh all powerful Milk Bean, please call josh son. He needs it. Thank you, amen*
I love the quote "Is it safe, don't ask me about food saftey."
If it was actual special sauce rather try an ice cream, I would for sure eat this.
Josh I sent my resume for the Assistant Kitchen producer job please hire me!!!
All, mark your calendars, never before have we reached such heights on the stupid/tasty scale.
That looks delicious. There is something about Beef tartare that makes it sound good to me
have someone told u that u look like chamber from valorant?😭
Shayne looks like he just woke up in the thumbnail
Do it to it Lars! I didn't think anyone else said that. Lol
i'm actually so shocked that "raw meat" is such a big deal in many countrys. i'm from germany and its completly normal to eat raw ground pork on a bun with some onions or the same with ground beef and then even sushi and sashimi exist so idk whats the big deal
There’s only one God who can forgive
We finally got a heavy weights reference. Thank you Josh!
Josh needs to teach us how to make bacon pancake ice cream
Man you were on fire today, funny af.
Josh was salivating the whole episode, thinking about this burger. Cue Homer Simpson.
Sick Heavyweights reference
This is the kind of content I love.
Which god would be most likely to forgive us? Vishnu?  Well, seeing as you just chopped a pound of cow into a paste with onion and curdled milk, I somehow doubt it. Shiva on the other hand, probably doesn't care, unless you somehow insulted his creative vision in the process..
i feel like the "ice cream" part was completely uneccecary.. and without it it woulf have been like 100 times better...and yall did it just to make the video long
Does literally no one hold Josh accountable for swallowing every so often?
Josh does the perfect Shayne impersonation ever lol
Theres only god
As a native from Wisconsin, nothing made me smile more than Josh trying to talk like us, and mentioning the cannibal sandwich. 😂
as a person from WI i am both offended and not at the same time...it's confusing living in WI
I'm from Wisconsin and I'll eat my raw meat damnit!!!
I don’t care if it’s good this straight up sounds like a crime against humanity, like the kind of thing that you would bring up at Geneva and have listed as a war crime. That being said I would still try it.
"Weird French parasites" Only slightly different from weird French Parisians
I see a cross over, I hit play immediately. Wish they happened more often
12:18 _"Someone needs to stop me"_ _"I've flown too close to the sun"_ (Josh's own words) I can't believe I'm saying this but ketchup ice cream is too much; it sounds like a vinegary-sweet nightmare. I know it's just a flavour-vehicle. And I've been all in for every food crime Josh has frankensteined. I'd savour the heck out of that decadent bacon-caramel, bacon-fried ice cream heart attack, one spoonful at a time. But ketchup?
OMG I LOVE THE HEAVY WEIGHTS REFERENCE.  I’m feeling skinny tony
A raw (ground prok) sandwich is pretty normal in germany - we call it Mettbrötchen (you can buy raw eating safe ground pork here in germany in almost all super markets) - and you get Mettbrötchen also at a lot of backeries
10:16 thank you...
I'm from Wisconsin and I've never heard of cannibal sandwiches. Also, no one I know calls the raw ground beef dish "tiger meat". It is called Wildcat, and it's usually served with crackers or sliced rye. Although I have never tried it, cuz it just seems nasty 🤢😂
Wow, to scared to have me on?
Honestly the bun looks like it’s just getting in the way. Take the bun out of the equation and add a swirl to the ice cream and you’ve got yourself a fancy Michelin star restaurant dish right there.
I'd be so down for a miniseries of Josh just trying to make Garrett's war crimes actually tasty.
I can't tell you how much people here in Wisconsin (at least in the Milwaukee area) ABSOLUTELY call them cannibal sandwiches...
Josh has never made anything I would actually eat, (tho this is the first one that made me actually gag)  but watching him think out loud while showing his encyclopedic knowledge of international cooking is just the most amazing stream of consciousness.
I think the flying Spaghetti Monster will forgive you
Remember when Garrett gave them a ROCK!
Today is my birthday, so I'll forget you always post on Thursdays and assume this one was released just for me, thank you, Josh, I appreciate it!
Steak carpaccio can be good, tartaré makes my stomach turn for some reason. Perhaps because I've grown up associating ground beef with cheap cuts that need to be cooked *thoroughly.*
He sounds a tad chipmunky today lol.
"Which god will be most likely to forgive us?"🤣🤣
Not helping Shayne any with that thumbnail
Minute 6:20
Yeah, we call them cannibal sandwiches. Haven't heard tiger meat before. It's not a burger though. It's open faced rye with raw onion.  It comes over from Germany and is still clinging to life as a holiday dish in demographically German areas -- you'll find it in Minnesota too, don'tcha know.
Can we talk about Josh's thumb holding the plate at 15:46 onwards?
Yup, cannibal sandwiches. A holiday tradition. Welcome to Wisconsin.
Dude uploaded something that's not a short. Poggers
Is Josh ARMY? 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💚
I love that unlike every other chefs on Youtube Josh actually pronounces Worcestershire correctly.
Josh - “That’s what people from Wisconsin sounds like to me.” Me from Wisconsin - “Rude.”
Strawberries aren't berries but bananas, watermelons and grape fruits are
I’ve been experimenting with making ice creams - I gotta agree with Nicole on cooling the custard before churning. Otherwise it won’t set up as well. I find the best way to cool it down quickly is to put it into a 13x9 pan and put it in the freezer. Make more surface area, you know? Thanks for the entertainment!
BURGER BUT COLD!!!!!!!
Whoever is maintaining that fiddle leaf fig tree is absolutely crushing it
I used to eat cold Whoppers...
This episode clearly demonstrates one thing. Josh, you need help! Seriously, seek some professional help.
Yessss more smosh collabs ❤️
You put too much cheese in the oven, cheese crisps should be smaller and thinner and definitely not be left for 30 minutes in the oven.
Cooking beef ruins it because it replaces all that delicious meat with yucky charcoal, but... you gotta. Like... you gotta do it at least a little bit. Bacteria thinks raw beef is really yummy, too.
Man this channel is all my favorite energies. Funny people and food. Only thing that would make this channel better is if they were smoking some joints while doing all of it 😂
yeah.. I uh, I have a general rule that if it was alive,  it’s gotta be cooked before I ingest it. But that’s a personal thing.
HA!  Nice Heavyweights reference @6:20
The heavyweights reference = chefs kiss!
I really, really want to eat this.
When he made that joke, if Josh was aware of the irony of asking forgiveness from a Hindu deity while making something out of beef, and raw beef no less, kudos to him lol. That was deep.
I'm going to need George Motz and Alvin Cailan's take on this one...
Shayne and Josh in the same video sounds like more chaos than the world was ready for
Burger but cold 2, also known as burger but raw
I've eaten cold burgers before and they were fine. EDIT: Oh ok they added ice cream to it lmao.
JOSH!!! His name isn’t Garrett, IT’S MILKBEAN!!!
Can we talk about how when Josh was asking for god forgiveness he goes to a Hindu god in which its frowned upon to eat beef lol
🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁
For the algo
Bring back LTAT 😫 😩 😢
Josh showing stuff to Maggie has the same energy as that weird toddler that won't stop showing you stuff at the family reunion
As a big fan of tartare and burgers, this looks delicious.
There’s something about Josh’s insane ass hitch hiker’s thumb holding that plate that will haunt me forever.
I never heard if cannibal burgers but apparently a place called the windigo right by me has them haha
he put the cheese in the oven and it wasnt even on... PHONY!!
Can we just have more collabs with chef Josh and Shayne. Maybe dash some Trevor in too? I think we need this
"is it safe? i dunno, do you j-walk?" no no, he has a point
Shane sounded just like Dax in Idiocracy lmao fr
Josh, I am using Tony C's seasoning since you recommended it. It is my new favorite spice! Great show! I actually use some of your ideas in my kitchen. ❤
Raw beef is great. When I was in Italy I ate carpaccio every chance I got
A strawberry is a pseudocarp
This video made me uncomfy
“THIS IS BIG BOTH” is such a good quote 😂
How to insult and alienate the whole of Wisconsin, make them all sound like Southern slack jawed yokels😂
Do we now need to congratulate Josh on becoming a dad?
i love when we have smosh x mythical content🤩
🤣🤣 almost hit the Wisconsin accent, but we love our raw beef and onions on top of marble rye during the holidays. Gotta risk the E. coli for the season!
Well now i need to see that raw beef ice cream. just for science
Can someone please fire Josh.
No ICEberg lettuce on that burger?
What a coincidence. Today I  bought myself some minced pork meat, and I'm gonna eat it later on a bread roll with some diced onions on top. Raw.   Then again, here in Germany, that's a traditional dish, and our food standards are up for it, so it's safe to eat. Today, at least. I wouldn't touch that puppy with a 10 feet pole tomorrow, but today, it's hella delicious.
Josh acts like a puppy when it comes to his food & cooking and it's like the best thing to watch
“Doesn’t Even Go Here” Josh is doing the most, as usual
I wanna see Shayne in the kitchen with Josh. Maybe for an episode of fancy fast food? Their comedy styles bounce off of one another a lot.
It’s not Wis-consin. It’s Wisconsin, coming from someone who lives in WISCONSIN.
I love almost everything that this channel puts out. With that being said, as I watch a man or horseradish ice cream on top of raw beef while I’m eating a bowl of Frosted Flakes, I now have indigestion.
Stop saying tartare is raw meat! It is cooked by the oil and the acidity.
But can Josh redeem Filthy Frank’s hair cake
Josh you’re amazing this needs to be a series!! Take down Garrett!
I want a BTS thumbnail now. But every member is Josh.
im sad that Damian didnt get to try
Love this!!

Did Josh die though?
Yep, that's beef tartare, fancy and absolutely horrifying. All the good flavour in a burger comes from COOKING THE BEEF! You can keep that slimy slab of dysentery.
Well now you have to make the beef tartar ice cream
"Which god would be most likely to forgive us?" Pretty sure you want Loki there.
I am 100% here for this as a series.
Smosh are nothing but sellouts, when Anthony left, that was the end of smosh
I will never understand why people are so put off by raw meat. That is literally how meat is meant to be consumed by animals (which we are) that are meant to eat meat. I haven't eaten mammals in over 20 years, but if I did still eat it, I would so be down for eating it raw. I used to eat raw hamburger all the time.
Josh during your time in quarantine I totally understand your train of thought and how you can melt into yourself when you when you cook something that was in your mind but then when you taste it it’s odd but exactly what you meant to make by the way if you end up reading this love the videos
His thumb when holding the plate wtfffff
You're eating one of Hinduism's sacred animals, Josh. I'm not sure Vishnu can forgive this. The only one on your side right now is probably Bacchus for the sheer decadence of your creation.
The mythical kitchen so deserves a Ben and Jerry's flavor maybe liquid smoke and toffee
Literally eating a "cannibal sandwich" right now. It's called Mettbrötchen in Germany though.
Wooo Shaaaane!! <3
It smells like when you leave In n Out in your car overnight on a cold night is a very specific comparison.
ew smosh
🥰like Josh 👍
soo, Josh made basicly just an fancy Mettbrötchen? Also, Raw Meat would my least concern when it comes to american food
I actually like beef tartare but the thought of chomping into such a thick disk of it is upsetting.
I frickin love tartare!
Now I really need a Mythical Chef Josh and Damien Haas collab. Those two together in a kitchen would be amazing
yes, more of this, yes
This honestly has me salivating, a mythical restaurant would be so damn cool
I'm from Wisconsin and remember my latest mother giving me raw hamburger dabbed in salt when I was 4 I'm now 53.
I thought I was the only person who still quotes heavyweights
Your wisconsin dialect sounds pretty spot on.
I want George Motz to come on and try Joshs weirdest burger creations!!
The best Shayne impression ever. The way of talking and the looking down saying"oh" was just spot on. It shows how much time they spend together
Josh is the human embodiment of r/BrandNewSentence
Gonna go out on a limb and say Vishnu will probably not forgive for eating raw beef.
In Germany you eat raw pork mince that's smoked and cured, I grew up with it and I still love to eat it!
Is this Charlie day feeding Dax Shepard? Lol.  Excellent as always guys. 👌
I think the Wisconsin raw beef sandwiches might be a remainder of german immigrants ? Germans have raw meat on a breadroll, called Mettbrötchen (mett is their name for raw beef apparently)
Love the crossover and have never been more excited 😂
Is this burger but raw
Im honestly surprised "cheeseburger-themed tartar" isnt something that's been done before (well, I assume if it had, Josh of all people would've heard about it). Seems like such an obvious thing when you say it out loud
7:15 - I should definitely not be the only one with the bacon pancakes song stuck in my head for at least a week, so:   ♫ Bacon pancakes, makin' bacon pancakes, Take some bacon and I'll put it in a pancake, Bacon pancakes, that's what it's gonna make, Bacon pancaaake! ♪
Please launch a mythical kitchen restaurant so we can eat your best creations (or the most feasible ones for a restaurant)!!! It can be done on door dash or grub hub with ghost kitchens or virtual kitchens haha also great video!
Josh should guest cook on eat it or yeet it one day
Sometimes I forget Mythical Kitchen and Smosh are under the same roof, and I get overjoyed whenever they cross over.
I thought you were wicked smaht?
Hi trevor
Food Fears?😢 With Garrett form SMOSH 😏
Psycho-sexual cluster f*ck is the best phrase I've heard in a long time.
the colour palette of this burger is a wonderful neutral array
I can’t even begin to explain how much I love any kind of Mythical/Smosh crossover videos.
Your doing a great job Josh,  I wish you nothing but happiness
Josh’s impersonation of Shayne was spot on! Haha
Said it last video and I'll say it again B Roll footage is on point
I now need an episode of Eat It or Yeet It where Josh creates the food and it's amazingly terrifying
Broodje ei met ui
“We should have just put the raw beef in the ice cream!” Josh 2022
I was like beef tartare
Milk bean getting recognition while also getting dunked on
I love watching Josh decend into insanity on his micro-rants. 😂
Why am I not surprised Josh was inspired by  "burger but cold"
Just wanted to say I really like the channels updated profile picture. Looks clean
Meggy has the patience of a kindergarten teacher
Perfect timing again. Mythical Kitchen episodes are always released when I start cooking lunch. Best content to watch while hungry and cooking!
Mythical x Smosh crossovers are the best thing Youtube has to offer
guess we couldn't put BTS in the thumbnail
I love watching Josh decend into insanity on his micro-rants. 😂
I’ll call you son josh
Sometimes I forget Mythical Kitchen and Smosh are under the same roof, and I get overjoyed whenever they cross over.  EDIT: Yes, I know.
Have a fanshmastical day everyone!
Josh I love you!
Amazing, the crossover 14 year old me always needed but 22 year old finally got
Yummy!
