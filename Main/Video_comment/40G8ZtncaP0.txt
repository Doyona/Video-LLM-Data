don't know if anyone gonna see this, but today's red card on myles lewis skelly instantly reminded me of this moment. if this is a yellow there is no way today was a red, michael oliver is biased af

This brought a tear to my eye 😢
Arsenal number 1
Didn't lose to man city trophy 🏆
martinelli headshotted ake (i know im late)
Love coming back to this and seeing Arsenal so happy after bottling the league again lmaoooooooo.
Imagine if it comes down to head to head and that goal is why Arsenal wins the title
Boring
this game was on my birthday 10/8/23
Arsenal matinelli scored a late stunner
Rewatching this in March 2024 and it's weird to see an Arsenal side that started Eddie Nketiah instead of Kai Havertz up front, and Gabriel Jesus instead of Bukayo Saka on the right. It's safe to say that the Arsenal of this video is not the Arsenal of the first 3 months of 2024. You can even see it on the way that corners are taken or defended. Granted, this is also a weird and slightly insipid Man City, featuring a Rico Lewis (whom I still believe was out of his depth in October) utilized almost exclusively for off the ball distractions, and no Kevin De Bruyne. I'm curious to see how both teams have evolved when they meet at the end of this month.
Time. Will. Tell.
I don't know how Kovacic did not get a red card
go city and arcanal
Bro launched it in his face and made him score an own goal 😂😭
I love u arsenal
Leicester can PL but Arsenal cant because they made too many enemies in PGMOL
Martinelli, MVP of the match❤
Why aren’t we talking about Haaland absence in this match?
Martinelli is MY BOY!!!!
Cage match
Sabrina's watching "Vampire" on Morning Mixtape on Fuse TV - Sabrina ❤
Ot saying ederson wouldnt have saved the gabrial shot but he really did put his laces and everything in that shot well played
3:10 Red card
The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Well done Arsenal.  -Tottenham fan
We prayed for days like these
As a city fan, I have to admit: No KDB no party for Haaland
Girlswrestlngl
Arsenal is back baby different levels 😂
Tough win Arsenal 🍺.
What a lovely hug between the coaches 😂.
Free win..
That was a red card offense
Was De bruyne injured? I swear without him, City are a complete different team
Refs are shady
they beat em by 1 lucky goal its not that amazing there still not gonna win the league
Congratulations to Arsenal for taking lead of the Premier League, now comes the hard part… holding on to the lead
I don't think arsenal is all that
Wolves beat manchester city
Arsenal beat manchester city
Foden👎👎
Porque sale la china esa fea al final siempre
🎶North London forever Whatever the weather These streets are our own And my heart will leave you never My blood will forever run through the stone🎶
Enjoy your win Arsenal until we see you in the etihad
Tomiyasu looking good at that striker position 😂
Why was arsenal kicking field goals the whole game no wonder they lost 12 consecutive games, passing in the box doesn’t exist
I know arsenal won this game but it's truly sickening how city constantly get/avoid calls in favor of them. I sincerely doubt the saudi trillions don't trickle into epl ref pockets. They want total and utter domination, why wouldn't they pay the refs off? They seriously have EVERYTHING go their way. It's insanely frustrating.
People saying before the season Haaland will even score more goals than last season. Highly doubt it
For all that think that Kovacic should of got  the Red card just look where the REF was not 10 yards away with an  open.  view. Unfortunately allot of acting in the today's soccer. Kudos to the REF that made a right decision and didn't ruin the derby.
How bottomed out the standard of refereeing is!
Many of your videos have the commentary panned too far to the left instead of down the center.
What am I missing the announcer said beautiful weather 25 degrees and everyone is in short sleeve jersey
So nice to go the fans and let them embrace you.
A very disappointing game to watch (far below my expectations for these two) but happy Arsenal finally beat Man City.
The announcer who called this game awesome
5:31 😂😂
I’m so upset I missed this game. Smh
😢
Arsenal really made a team you see in movies, signed all the players that big teams no longer wanted and made a wonder team out of them
Dude got smashed in the face
Great game
Partey pass had City’s defense split and the goal was worked out by the 4 substitutes that came on in the second half. Well done Gooners…Better luck next time to City
Hala Madrid
PGMOL release the audio... another insanely shocking missed call. Poor refereeing is becoming the norm it seems
nketiah showing how selfish is he again!
Yeah that's right 👍
as a man city fan. arsenal is something that man united wishes to be right now. y'all are amazing.
Proud of arsenal. Gives me hope that a bunch of cheaters won’t be at the top of the table at the end of the season
I hope Raya doesn't end up being our Onana.
Deflections are always unpredictable, they should've just flipped a coin to see who wins. If you see the original trajectory of the ball it was gonna be saved but his shot was so bad it went in on accident. Goofy ah Arsenal.
The fact that Oliver and VAR were given a perfect second chance to fix their mistake and get Kovacic off the field and still messed it up blows my mind. I can't help but feel that if that was Granit Xhaka or anyone in red for that matter, there would have been no mistake in the first VAR review...
Min: 8:27 The moment you realized your training is competed, and the satisfaction smile comes out.
How did CITI’S Lewis’s goal not count? The play was still going on. I saw NO stoppage of play.
Rodri the missing piece for city for sure. Gabriel seems to have haaland's  number. Arsenal didn't shy away, they were pretty tough. I just hope they understand that beating city doesn't mean that's it. They still need to improve with player management,  season is long. I hope they understand. I want to think that their biggest rivals will be those mid tiers teams. Anyway enjoy the victory and get ready to for more coz I guarantee you that city will make a come back and other teams will look to take advantage of the opportunity
If Raya keeps making these simple mistakes it eventually will cost us dearly that’s the second game I’ve seen him do multiple risky passes
Never heard a more impactful “North London Forever” ❤
When the student is ready the teacher disappears
Pure luck!
I was there, the one arsenal fan sitting in the away section with my wife. (Another story on how) It was just such a pay off to see the goal afte 85 mins of  hearing these spoilt city fans sing about being champions.( And deservedly so). I got caught celebrating, called out and it could have gotten ugly but my friend (city fan) saved me. My first epl game seeing my beloved arsenal (17 years a fan) and then walking London streets. I'm ever so grateful for the experience. COYGs
Arsenal celebrating as if they won the league 😅
LETS GO ARSENAL
You would think Beating City was a new trophy by everyone’s reactions.
6:15 Jesus should've passed that ball to Rice
Arsenal !!!
What a wholesome At 4:15 watched it atlist 50 times and still watching it saliba talked to halland on his own language saliba was like I know u ain’t trynna to do what u think to do while am here sleep yoo a** down!!!
That shot was gonna go up to the 77th row.... if it wasn't for the deflection... lol I don't know why OVERRATED martinelli  is celebrating like he meant it lol... clown
JOIN, FOR GIVEAWAYS
kovacic was a red
Alr bro wtf was ederson doing when martinelli scored 😂😂😂😂 bros body was lagging
5:02 Rico Lewis continuing to play After the whistle and Not getting booked…reminded me of the injustice that Wenger’s Arsenal suffered when the referee sent off Van Persie for nothing vs Pep’s UEFALONA in 2011.
Lol despite the referees trying to help Pep and City by not sending Kovacic off, I’m glad Arsenal won despite that.
Unfortunately I’m a MU fan. And watching them play is like watching your toxic ex throw up all over the floor then watching her drink it over and over and over until we both throw up.   With that being said. I would rather watch an Arsenal game over a MU game at any given point between now and the near future 😂  On the other hand.. I could watch MC get beaten everyday 😂😂
😡🤬🤬🤬…
There it is, it has been almost a day later, I've even watched the replay and I still cannot believe that Arsenal beat our neighbors in Manchester. No love lost, but extremely unexpected. Good on Arsenal!
Losing to lens probably wasn’t so bad after all
Haaland about to score 10 goals next match 😅
Keep Partey at all cost.
No highlight of Kovacic escaping the second yellow for foul on rice ??
Declan Rice was quality in the midfield during this game.
COYG  Absolutely buzzing about the win.
It's time, put ramsdale back in
Partidasso, Gracias Japón.  Tremendo Argentina Dale vamos con todo!
Jesus is my Lord & savior
Thank you NBC sports for not showing the score on the thumbnail or title unlike other broadcasting channels
City just got unlucky
No KDB no party
People talking TP5 should be let go. You don't know what you're talking about. Who else saw that game changing pass?
Arsenal need a Poacher
How do these clowns putting the clips together not show that 2nd Kovacic challenge?? Absolute joke
Wow imagine what not being selfish af does 😅
Small club mentality
Thank God . I am sick of hearing Manchester City.
Arsenal fans just wait til Kdb gets healthy… you’re not winning
Kyle Walker can't replace Mahrez spot...big mistake coach
its the first time in years that the arsenal squad is stronger than man citys
Gabriel improved so much in the off-season. Looks like a different defender than last year. COYG!!
This wad a ganevto wstch live
"A Premier League title-winner with Blackburn Rovers back in 1995" is a sentence that sounds more insane with each passing year
Honestly the biggest reason why Arsenal won is the fact that they didn’t concede early. Had man city scored, Arsenal wouldn’t have gotten anything going the remainder of the game. We got lucky in the beginning and we pulled through! COYG!!
Is the editors for this channel doing a bit of PR for VAR by not showing the second Horrendous tackle that that should have been a second booking to Kovačić when he made the same tackle on Declan Rice just minutes after a controversial tackle he made on Odegaard!
That first one was definitely a red and the second was definitely a yellow
Honestly RAYA is not a good goalkeeper very poor decisions  Arsenal should xonsider to get  a different goalkeeper
Haland is overrated. He does not show up in big games and he is nominated for balandor! I am not sure why people voted for him!!He us trash in big games! Alvarez should  be playing
How was Kovacic not sent off?!!! What is going on? Curtis got sent off for rolling over a ball and onto a player, Kovacic tackles wkth a high foot on the players leg. PGMol is a joke!!!!
Well done, Arsenal. Wouldn’t say it’s the top rivalry in English football though.
So according to the PGMOL that tackle is ok but Jones accidental foul was a straight red…. I guess when your referees are hanging out in Abu Dhabi it makes the rules different for Man Cheaty
Deflection FC
Let’s be honest….Prime made the difference here
Rice Rice baby ✊🏾 was absolutely amazing in that midfield. I don’t wanna hear anymore slanders about Rice. He was impressive yesterday. He really proved to everyone that was questioning his price tag wrong,  including myself. To All you Arsenal haters STFU …..  Also Martinelli, white, Jesus, Gabby, and saliba were all unbelievable yesterday…   Martinelli, What a great away to reintroduce yourself to the world, after being out for the last 3 weeks.. Welcome back Superstar!
where are the plastic fans crying for Arteta's head and talking smack about Havertz?!??
I don't like Arsenal, but anyone who beats City is alright by me!
deflections always killing man city
Arteta should make it clear to odegaard that he is not a striker. There are many instances in this game where he chose to send the ball to the stands instead of looking for a pass
COYGGGGGGGG
Kovacic should have been send off twice lol
so that wasnt an own goal?
This why party should start every game, cuz without party there’s no party. Our midfield lineup should be Odegaard, Rice and Party. This was a beautiful win. Let’s goooo Gunners !
I bet Onana can save that goal cuz he won't react when the ball hits Ake's head
Where was the worlds greatest all time striker, haaaaland, he dissapears in big games because he couldnt find tap ins
as a harsh critic of havertz I am so happy he was able to get an assist today. Surely will only boost his confidence and shape him into a great footballer. COYG
Lucky goal
Kovacic was red 110%. I honestly as a gunner fan don't feel safe with raya as a goally
Not the comments acting like arsenal played amazing when they goal was in the 86th and it was a lucky rebound, not to mention Ake cost us the game missing that 1 v 1, city deserved to lose I’ll admit that tho
Honestly get raya tf out
That ake miss🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
why didn’t you show the other foul by kovacic ?
اللهم صل على سيدنا محمد وعلى آل سيدنا محمد
Arsenal really needed this win. They have lost 12 consecutive games against City and there was no way they were going to allow that to continue. It was a good thing Arteta substituted Trossard and put in Martinelli and he immediately changed the game. Saliba and Gabriel totally shut out Haaland. It was like he wasn’t even in the game. This is a deserved win for Arsenal but tbh Kovacic should have seen red
Such a great win, but how did these highlights not include Ben White's meg on Doku as the Gunners were killing time???   Zinchenko shutting him down right as he gets on the pitch was also a slept on moment. COYG!!
Not a red card. Lol Corruption is in your faces.
Haaland with another Balon d’Or performance today 🔥
Manchester city look great, they could have scored early but didn’t
A game of tactical genius what a player WILLIAM SALIBA ❤👏
City had to have KDB and Rodri injured and concede on an unlucky defection for Arsenal to beat them. Truly shows the levels they are on
Happy for Arsenal, but still kinda mind-blowing to me that Arteta favors Raya over Ramsdale. First half exposed him imo
Tomiyasu ❤❤
Where was Haaland the entire match .. any impact ?
Arsenal fans celebrating now but will be crying in May
Jorginho and Rice midfield actually worked well
Arsenal was slightly better than City. Although the goal was fortunate because Ake changed its direction, they deserved the win.
North London forever!
Credit to Arteta, the 3 subs combined for the goal: Partey, Tomiyasu, Havertz to then pass to Martinelli
The only player Arsenal need right now that can take them to another level is  Victor Osimhen.
Pep Guardiola be like, in 442oons style:  Ake's header costs us a game. GRRRRR! IT'S PAYBACK TIME! GRRRRR! What shall we do with the dodgy defender? What shall we do with the dodgy defender? What shall we do with the dodgy defender as revenge for looosing?
Honestly I prefer Ramsdale.  He made some  crazy saves last season.  Raya has allowed goals that I think would have been saved if it was Ramsdale.
They’re nothing with Haaland or de bryune….
Whad did Mikel Arteta say to Pep Guardiola, finally, "I feel your feeling, Brother. Because,  It happens so many  times to me. 😜"
Superb effort to win this. North London forever gives me goosebumps!
I couldn’t breathe I was yelling so loud
🔴⚪
that was the worst way to win against them but gg
Great win, especially again City. Raya was lucky his weakness footing the ball didn’t hurt Arsenal.
Raya needs to stop wasting time on the ball.
Saka and Martinelli are my fav players in the team but Rice and Saliba seem to be moving up the ranks for me.  This breed of gunners are insane. We have waiting long enough for such amazing football.  Thank you Arteta.
Arteta owns pep
Bruh HOW is that not a red card
For the first time in a long time Man City looked worried throughout the game. They played not to lose, instead of going for the win.
Finally Arsenal took down City. Good on them
Arsenal fans are hella happy but in the second match-city  be different and probably smash them congrats on the win
The game was great but the highlights was slacking how they out them like other highlights
“He has dreamed about this day he has dreaded it” announcers say as arsenal take a W
Alvarez the new messi we ned only 2 o 3 months
Suprised Kovacic didn't get a red card. Its way dangerous than Jones and Gusto's.
That after-game handshake between pep and arteta was cold...  Neither one knew what to say... lol 🥶🥶🤣🤣
Marinelli should have went up to Pep and shhhh'd him
City needs to reshuffle. Debruyne’s absence has caused a lot of damage
Man someone's got to close down Martinelli down there he had ages to line that up. One lapse in communication between Foden and Walker could be the title.
Game was pretty boring tbh... congrats to arsenal on finally beating citeh after 10 years
Finally
This was just an emotion game for not winning last season’s second game. They still won’t win the title this season.
If VAR gets pulled in to review a call the on field referee HAS TO go view it under any and all circumstances. Any ref worth their job should be able to determine the proper call and it’s correct consequence. VAR is to assist refs not decide calls. What has been happening with VAR recently is an absolute shame between last week and this week PGMOL needs to get it together
What happened to the new fancy intro cards ? :(
No Debruyne …. BIG problem
KDB is the heart and soul of MC.  Without him.....
ending music, name plz❤
De bruyne considered half of city team
Mancity dont care this year. They already won the champions league
Declan rice special
I really was thinking to myself "we'll be fine if we make it late with no goals, Martinelli can make the difference"
As long as city doesn’t win it a fourth season in a row, I don’t care who wins it.
low key pep is proud
🪞🪞🪞 Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who will win the league in May?  *TOTTENHAM, TOTTENHAM, AT LAST!*
why they kneel?
Papa Debruyne left an orphanage unattended😢
Winning by luck. Man city was way better.
I can't stop watching every highlight
What a goal by Aké
David reya made all the difference in this fixture
Haaland likes to stay quiet in the big game and he’s getting really good at it😂
Nketiah needs to be benched FOR LIFE
Yeah yeah yeah 😂 at last night blessings now watching ok❤❤
Nketiah is not good enough for this squad ! Pls find the right one
5:00 how did Rico commit a foul?!?!? He got pressed by two and knocked to the ground and he committed the foul? Ref must’ve hit sound loud before the game cuz that was bs
The haters can't handle it
Liverpool player gets two red cards for kovacic fouls
Man City letting go of Gundogan and picking up Kovacic was a fatal mistake.
But wait, I thought Alvarez was the new Messiah!? 😂
U can tell Arteta wants this for so long
If is casa immediately red card out we knw city is refs favorite.
Arsenal lucky Rodri & KD weren’t playing
Where’s Kevin we need you back ASAP
Dear NBC, please don’t spend close to 2 mins replaying the line ups. If we want to know it, we can google it, or make it 3 seconds long. I would much appreciate if we could see more of the game. For example, if there was a goal that was overturned, a play, a build up, you get the picture 😅.   Thanks
The curve on that shot by Martinelli, beautiful
Martinelli is definitely maturing and becoming a great player to make a difference in every match! Great job, Arsenal. It's not easy to beat this Manchester City Team.
Is the VAR working or not how comes Kavacic didn't get Red even after the VAR replay 😢anyways it is better he was not Red cuz we wanted to beat City without any excuse
“It was always gunna happen”
How is Curtis jones’ tackle a red but not kovacic?
NORTH LONDON FOREVER
No Saka - no problem   This one is huge in title fight
Martineli is a beast.
I don't  have  anything  to say  about  my team  today.  You are amazing  people  ❤❤❤❤ .
nbc used to be my childhood this group this music the images i used to get so excited as a kid waking up to watch a game with nbc  sadly cant do that anymore
City is starting broken as haaland is loosing confidence.
mikel arteta was but a learner when he left pep and now he is the master 😂
Give Haaland the Ballon d’Or 😂😂
KOVACIC should've gotten that RED CARD!! COYGs! On to the next! LETS GOOO GUNNERS!!!
Haaland always looks good when the rest of the squad isn't carrying him
If Haaland wins the balon dor over Messi you will know football is dead
this game was a  chess match. It was all a tactical battle between pep and arteta. both teams threw their philosophy out the window.  Arteta even said he counter doku with tomi. Then doku moved to the other side against white which then Arteta told tomi to push up and it resulted in a goal.
ABSOLUTE SCENES AT THE EMIRATES!! We did it. Not a banger of a game, but a banger of a result. My boy Nelli shining like he deserves.
Who's telling referees in the PL and La Liga to be so blatantly horrible? VAR is now clearly rigged too. How could Kovicic have been allowed to stay in the game after his sloppy defense? I'm a neutral so no bias here
robbery... disgraceful performance by VAR and the FA
COYG❤
Crazy inconsistency in the officiating. Curtis Jones got a red for a much less serious tackle and Kovacic doesn't even get sent off. Liverpool fan btw, i don't even like Arsenal but this is ridiculous.
It’s always a great day when Haaland loses!
Thanks NBC...now please put a full match replay on YT so I can watch it.  COYG beat Chelsea !!!
Idk even if they had KDB back is this Man City team still the same machine they were last season?
What do we think of tottenham?
halland never comess oout in big games when we need. him most
Love to see it
why is arsenal playing raya over ramsdale .he made to many mistakes
The City is finished.
gvardiola
Ake will be the downfall of city’s dominance
Pep out 😂
LETS GOOO!!! Now that W should take Arsenal's confidence and blast it through the roof! Finally, we showed up and put together a gutsy performance against a Top Top team. What a day!
Did you change whoever made the highlights?..it’s too quick, no replay on key moments
Do be honset man city had better players arensal has better iq and chemistry
I didn't watch the game, but can anyone tell me if Gabriel or Saliba pocketed Haaland??
So crazy that even with this win London is still lily white
That goal was trash 🗑️ but only counts inside the net  Well done 👍 but still trash 🗑️
The fans won the game. City players did the right thing to applaud them.
Those of us who backed arteta through all the touch times….. give yourself a pat on the back mates!!!!!!
mcfc need gvardivol, kovacic to improve.
Lucky goal. This probably would have end 0-0.
I really like Nketiah but I think it’s time to look for a new striker. Jesus was amazing today and the few times that Nketiah got the ball he held it well, but he doesn’t go towards the goal.  I hope he can shine and do well like he did last season, when Jesus wasn’t available. However I think it’s time for Arteta to find a replacement soon so that we can finally win the prem! ❤️🤍
Second best player was haverts
I knew before season started that this team will never be the same, they lost top play makers like Mahrez and Gundo etc. and De Bruyne out injured. What gifted play maker do they have to assist and play class balls? You see how Halland is a Ghost now.
gunners showed up in a big way today.  r gunners prem 🏆 contenders?????
The robot never scores in big games. But have you noticed? 🤣
Raya giving me a heart attack most of the game. end he really showed his distribution. wish arsenal would’ve attacked a bit more and not seem so nervous but i guess it all worked out!
Number 14 arsenal, what a joke!!
I feel horrible for Ake
i know david raya got a shutout but he's scaring me with his passes
Good win but Raya looked shaky today. Maybe it's time to bring back Ramsdale
This what happens when the best player on Man City is not there. Kevin Debryne you are needed
Next time someone says that Man City are the best team to ever exist I’m gonna bring up the fact that they’re on a 2 game losing streak
Huuuuh what liverpool got two reds but kovacic gets e yellow for his studs on the Achilles
Would've been great if it was on USA or NBC. Not everyone gets Peacock!
Put Raya in the bin. Too nervy, no ball control
The commentator sounds like a Dalek🤖
As a fan Manchester United, just looking at the crosses and throughs in the game I want to say that these 2 teams are playing at a completely different level. 🥲
The foul committed by Kovacic against Odegaard was a clear red card. They even reviewed it at VAR!
Terrible game. PL overrated
6:25 Tomiyasu is like me free-controlling the active player in FIFA. Running up front, heading a ball back, and then run out of the area like it's lava. Team AI was like we'll score the goal without you human user.
What a great performance between both teams and great win by Arsenal 💯💯💯
It may sound like an exaggeration but when Martinelli scored the goal and the game whistle was blown which declared Arsenal's victory against Manchester City in the English Premier League for the first time since 2015-16 season, I was burst into tears. I shed tears of joy because I was happy and it flashed back to memories of suffering losses against them for 8 years. This really makes everything perfect for me.
And both of these provincial clubs are behind Spurs..
Havertz did a great job holding the ball against Ake, attracting 3 City players, then assisted Martinelli. He has the quality.
Both london togehwaqqq
Halaand 😂😂😂
Good on arsenal for beating the terrorists.
Pep is in so much pain
Arsenal so jammy smh
What was the chant after full time? I can't tell what they are saying.
Every week I am mind blown at the sheer inconsistency of the officiating. I understand not wanting to ruin one of the biggest games of the year but 10 times out of 10 that should be a red card on Kovacic. There have been red cards for way less than that recently. It's either the officials are pathetically incompetent even with replay or there are ulterior motives at play. At least when there was no VAR you could just chalk these up as mistakes but who in their right mind doesn't award a red for that challenge? There are no excuses left. When is this going to stop?
Arsenal just won the PL OMG
This was honestly such an underwhelming offensive display all around
@5:59 look how many arsenal player was upset he took a shot, its true passion
Arsenal did not deserve it
8 years 16 premier league games…
You can tell MC sure misses DeBruyne.
With every passing game I’m convinced more and more Maddison is the better attacking midfielder.   MO looking sus out there
Well done Arsenal
Huge disappointment for City at the end and major encouragement for Arsenal’s season
We needed that WIN 🎉
How many times have we seen this with Man City? Start of their season, they’re a little slow. Man City is just getting started. They don’t hit their stride until the second half of the season. Their “slow” start is still better than 90% of other teams.
This is a battle between two geniuses and their coaching / strategy and chess
Haaland dives and complains so much it's pathetic. Seemingly Pep only encourages the diving of his players
Congrats to Arsenal for winning the treble
This is the 2nd game where feels like Holland isn't even on the pitch
Guardiola tiene que reeinventarse otra vez , porque el estilo ya lo comocen. Needs same update on formation.
Two phenomenal teams yall 🥶
It’s crazy arsenal winning makes me happy makes me smile imagine saying that 2 seasons ago 😂😂
MARTINEGOAT
Even with the refs help to the oil club football one. Congrats arsenal
Wow what a poor game
whats up with the risky short passes in front of our own goal ? and Raya does he think he is an attacker ? or his job is to play tricks ? too much air got into him. could have been at least couple goals if not more because of his bs. Mr. Raya chill
Can someone else but Howard read the lineups? Dude reads at a 3rd grade level
Where is KDB when you need him the most
Fogging Coyg.
THE game to watch was Liverpool and city not too long ago. Now it’s Arsenal and city. Exciting game even if both teams were slightly off today
Arsenallll
That’s all arsenal will win this season again! It’s funny how happy arsenal fans get to beat city they won’t win champions nor PL for a long time!  Cmon citeh! 🏆💎
Don't they miss Gundogan?
Unlucky result it could've gone either way.
6:20 I was just as confused as the commentator, tf was tomiyasu doing all the way up there xD I thought he's a defender! nonetheless good header to setup for the goal
Not giving a red card for that just adds more questions to the rules. Is the leg supposed to break for them to be like yeah that's a red
Just a yellow card for that slide tackle on Odegaard achilles by Walker? Wow. That’s should’ve definitely been a red.
Man I fell asleep for the last 10 minutes 🤦‍♂️. Thought the game ended in a tie
They are miles ahead of  ManUtd
2 consecutive losses after 5 years for Manchester City…that says a lot.
coyg
You can’t convince me that wasn’t an own goal 😂
Arsenal 🔥
YYYYYEEEEESSSSS!!!!!!! ARSENAL! ARSENAL!! ARSENAL!!! ARSENAL!!!! ARSENAL!!!!! ARSENAL!!!!!!
LET'S GO ARSENALLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
COYG!!!!!
Arteta and Guardiola handshake go crazy!
Jesus at RW actually cooks
As a spurs fan, I'm super happy for Arsenal, what a match!  GG!!!
Havertz to be used more as a central striker going forward?   I think oshimen in the summer would be perfect until then.
Saliba flattered haaland hahaha
That cushion header by Tomiyasu tho...👀👑🔥🔥🔥💯
Thanks to Tomiyasu for his intteltiual display and generosity.
Kneeling in 2023... 😅
kovacic shouldve gotten a red for all his bad late tackles and rico lewis should cut his hair cause he looks dumb
Also should have been a red card
You gatta give it to him this whole game i havent seen him walk
Saliba is the best CB in the league. The trio of him, Gabriel, and rice at 6 is impeccable. If those 3 stay healthy all year, arsenal will have the best defensive record in the league.
M C,sure miss KdB
I wonder how Kovacic didn't get red card in this match after two yellow cards but thank God we won.
What happens when Rodri is not there.
I refuse to believe that Haaland wins the balon d or, absolute ghost against good teams and when without debruyne
Red card all day
Ake was amazing the whole game ! My hearts breaks for how the goal was scored!
Where was haaland?
Lucky
Not convinced by Arteta's goalkeeping choice.  First he got rid of a World Cup winner, and now he brings on someone who makes at least one mistake a day.
F.peacock
First back to back league losses for city since 2018
A very composed performance in the first half of the second half.  Unfortunately I wasn't able to see the rest of the match.  Peacock is great.
Stop the kneeling bs
It's unfortunate what happened to Ake cause he has been working hard to cement his place on the team but Martineli  is always hunting for goals. Alvarez played well too but where was Haaland? 🤔
they didnt even show the second kovacic red card tackle lmao
Anything but MC!
The only time I root for the Gunners' is when playing Man City!
Arsenal played well. It’s was 11vs 12 the whole match. Ref was playing for man city.
Arsenal is overrated asf
lucky.
That was the defenders fault. Why he tried to move out of the way? He should of took it with his face!
Eversince man city lost to wolves, they haven’t been steady on defense and attack
Another deflection XD
Arsenal really grinded out for the win with a little luck on Martinelli's shot bouncing off of Ake's face. 😂  Great substitutions in the second half, and I was surprised at how Jorginho played today.
How did kovacic finished this game?
I know not much happened in the match, but this was a really choppy edit. Rought cut?
Beyond ridiculous that Kovacic doesn't get a red card / 2 yellows.
I’ve been waiting on days like this …. Let’s all be humbled
Somebody tell me what Haaland is doing there on the pitch
City has lost its fluidity for quite some time now, evidenced by 5 teams scoring more goals to date. How to reinvigorate the attacking fluidity should be Pep and City's priority or it may end up a trophyless season! Also, Haaland's subpar skills on ball handling, dribbling and retention has been manifest - his first premier season may turn out to be his best if he is unable to improve one way or another.
Ben White nutmeg was crazy
Arsenal sucks, left them in 1997. They almost killed me, useless team.
K. De Bruyne, Stones & Rodry disagree that.
Over reliance on KDB is bitting Man city in the butt
lucky goal...
Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success.              Bravo Arsenal
🤦‍♂️ City really need to be humbled in practice on the daily on how many losses they done
Please Please Please take Ramsdal back. He is farrrrrrrr better than Raya
Yes!! What a goal Martenelli!
ARSENAL IS BETTER
I'm a Man U fan but I must admit! Arsenal are playing some beautiful football
Why are you kneeling? For what???
To lose bc you got hit in face is atrocious
What was the deal with the rico lewis play where he was knocked to the ground on the ball, but got back up and scored?
COYG! Some tactical observations: Jesus looked great on the RW Rice playing higher up initially, as a box to box midfielder, looked dangerous Substitutes all made a huge impact and made the goal  Looks like we finally have the squad depth we have been wanting all these years
The season is awesome, it’s all up for grabs!
City only having 4 shots has to be a first in a very long time.
Man city needs Kevin De Bruyne.
Arsenal goal: Partey -> Tomi -> Kai -> Martinelli. All 4 are Arsenal's subs in the second half.
That’s goal was made by all t he subs. Partey long ball, heading into space by Tomiyasu, controlled and passed by Havert and the Finish by Martinelli.
Celebrating like they won the champions league 😂. It’s just city 😂😂
At last!
Congrats to Arsenal! However, both teams showed close to nothing in attack. This wall all about pressing high by both teams, yet with nothing going further. Arsenal have had a luck with the goal while Ake missed when having even a better moment. Instead, deflected the ball into its own net.
City sucks. LOL
Clear red card... no ball, all studs
No gando no mahrez
Yes 🙌
03:09 maybe i'm bias, but that foul deserve at least a yellow card
Man city is  vulnerable and less productive without Debruyne!
Eye Luv Rebecca Lowes.
Poor Arsenal 😂😂😂😂
havertz up front setting up the goal... why not give him a shot at striker
When Partey is on, expect the Party to be +ve
Off his face... Disrespectful.
And still man city wins the tre..again!
Arsenal got away with one That should have been a red card
Silva looked dead. I am telling y'all, Pep Should have kept Mahrez
Arsenal will choke mid season
Wow was that fun!! So happy for Mikel. As a Yank growing tired of our version, this was just a wonderful display of the game. Jumped on the Gunners bandwagon last year and am not getting off. Hope Ake can eat tonight after getting that Wilson burger jammed into his face.
Galatoomi rebka today's My country it's big festival l'm so happy today
If you haven't seen the match and purposely don't know the score, it would be really nice if nbc didn't post spoilers in the corner, seconds before you actually see the goal scored! 😬
Why did Doku not play ? 🤦🏾‍♂️
Great goal AKE🤣
What a game🎉🎉🎉🎉‼️
What is the song Arsenal sang at the end?
I love seeing Oil City lose - don't care who does the deed.  Well done Arsenal. Suck it up Pep.
Arsenal won because they had luck. It was a lucky deflection. Arsenal were prepared for this luck. Good job 👏🏾
Kovacic should have been ejected twice
Love Haaling as the 1 but man I feel like he needs to be more involved
Arsenal fans acting like they won the league already, u have to keep winning or city will eventually catch up.
No de Bruyne or Rodri and it’s not man city anymore to be fair.
How is kovacic not a red card?
Lessss gooo arsenalllllll 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
6:23 that’s why you play Partey, not fucking Jorginho.
Is Zinchenko overrated?. I genuinely don’t feel that he is a difference maker.
This may just be the fire Man City needed to start playing better.
I thought Arsenal would've done great if they could've simply managed a draw against Man City given the circumstances, getting a win here was huge!
I personally don’t like Raya to be Arsenal’s keeper, he does some dummy things like today for example, the other two keepers that make the same stupid mistakes are Onana and Chelsea’s goalkeeper, Sanchez.
As an Arsenal supporter, I think the biggest takeaway is how important the players and Arteta keeping their heads cool was after the Kovacic decision(s) having not gone their way. I think back to New Year's Day 2022, where I was so confident after the first half that we were going to win or at least get a point. But a penalty, two Gabriel yellows in a minute and a Rodri dagger in added time later, there was nothing to show for it. I think back to last season, where we were on top for 230+ days, and then lack of squad depth and versatility slowly but surely caught up to us. Today not every play looked beautiful, a few decisions did not go our way and certain squad members didn't always look entirely assured, but looks can be deceiving. Each [full] season has taught Mikel and the boys a different lesson, and they have clearly learned. We can't always play the Arsenal way and things won't always be perfect going into and during certain matches. But if they trust the process, dull emotions when it's needed and let the fans join them on the pitch (mentally obviously), then the sky is the limit.  I said halfway through last season that no matter the result by the end of it I was proud of the squad, and today I'm not sure I could be any prouder... well, maybe if we end the season with more than just a Community Shield to show I will be.
Even though im a tottenham fan im very happy at this result thank you arsenal
Can we sell Nketiah already. Literally has 0 ball control always ruining the momentum of the play. He literally can’t score anything but tap ins.
It’s very disrespectful to see Lewis starting over those natural midfielders not try to talk down on him but I think pep confusing him mentally. he’s a great kid let him master his craft first at rightback or leftback 💯
this is so special! team has grit, the fans are loving it, we're all in on the arteta arsenal and its booming. rough start to the year with injuries and all the meh performances, but this is the 2nd youngest prem team and they're learning! theres only up to go, and today makes this all worth it!!! this is HUGEEEE  COYG
Title pretenders
Хто вище бʼє той краще грає 😅
ARSENAL  ARSENAL  ARSENAL
Raya's long balls at the end of the game were fantastic. City couldn't get the ball back because his passes landed at Jesus's feet, and we were able to run out the clock.
Why didn’t you show the blatant second yellow on Kovacic? Just because Arsenal won doesn’t mean you can sweep the fraudulent refereeing under the rug.
Ake was too soft. Should have taken the shot straight at his face
Is football coming back to south England?
I can’t believe VAR. Prem refs are the worst in the world.
Perling Taapinland exposed as was his coach the bald fraud. To no ones surprise he ghosted in the match.
That klopp look alike is always there 😅😅
Lowlights
it’s so beautiful
COYG!!!! 💪🏼💪🏼
Haaland is just starving, little to no passes coming his way this season.
COYG
This loss will help City win the title again … because Pep will get on their A$$ for poor performance and not able to score …. Arsenal will still end up runners up
Arsenal wanted it more and they got it
How does kovacic stay on the pitch
This whole "say no to racism" while every race invades and destroys seems subversive.   What kind of berg or stein is behind that?
It's amazing how Jones gets a red card for lightly going in studs up, while Kovacic throws himself at Odegaard and get's away with a yellow. You cannot convince me the PGMOL isn't corrupt!
WOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The most disliked players in the PL saw each other today: Silva and Jesus.
Did the PGMOL tell NBC sports to not add any highlights surrounding kovacics challenge?
Man city 1 shot on target unbelievable 😂😂😂😂
it's nice to see oil money loose
Theres no constency with the refereeing. How does Kovacic not see red?
Jesus has to pass that ball sometimes he just wants to do too much or just show off and he loses the ball but hes good
Gabriel Jesus could’ve have Penalty which was denied. Kocavic could’ve been sent out but wasn’t.  Kept Haaland in San Fran bay This Arsenal Team is resilient team. I never doubt this team
After last week's red for Jones, how is that one not a red card?
Bro Partay legit might be the best 6 in the world. Top 5 if I’m not overhyping. Also I don’t care if Jesus doesn’t score that guy is one the most creative footballers in the world
Why sub off alvarez?
First victory against Man City when we best them in the FA cup.
Watching these highlights, all I can say is that if these are the most interesting moments of the game, I feel sorry for anyone who had to watch the whole thing!
So happy for Tomiyasu to be involved in the goal given the fact that he initiated City’s win at the Emirates last season
Great impact by havertz!!
Why did they take a knee before the match?
Absolute chills when Martinelli scored 🔴⚪️
Nice header pass by Tomiyasu😊
Imagine celebrating a deflection lmaoo
without rodri we are doing bad
They fucking did it. Lets go Arsenal!
This ref was a wasteman but glad we still won
The ghost 👻
Michael Oliver needs to be suspended.   Absolutely criminal decision not to book Kova for the second yellow.
Zina💪
Unlucky. I think Ake is taking the term "use your head"  too seriously 😅
Thank god Arsenal won 🔥🔥🔥
I like the commentary @8:32…the pupil has finally beaten the teacher….
Jesus, White, Saliba, Gabriel, Rice.. Partey, Nelli, Havertz and Tomiyasu were awesome..
Pep Out
Let's gooooooo
great game
Ake with the broken nose and the L lmfao
We rule.
I love how they didn’t show the second kovacic foul because they knew they couldn’t defend him not getting sent off. Lol absolutely ridiculous.
Baby Hulk Hogan was quiet today.
Gooners
Saliba gave Martinelli some slaps at the end😂😂
Arsenal beat city, watch how Chelsea will beat arsenal
What’s the difference between Curtis Jones red card and Walker’s non red card
This is what happens when you don't have Rodri.
The.  most Arsenal way to win ever
It took an unlucky deflection and a weak city team to best them😂 but congrats
Without Rodri and KDB. Mid is non existent. Lewis is a winger, bernardo us a CM, foden is not a winger.
North London is having a great season this far Tottenham and Arsenal sitting top of the league. This was a fun game Havertz actually played well and I think everyone is overreacting over the kovacic tackle it really wasn't that terrible.
I can’t believe that wasn’t a red card. Clearly went into the tackle studs up
Pep's dismissive handshake was the best thing in the world. It's always harder to lose to your mates, but I would have thought maybe he'd have shown a little more love to his former assistant coach.
God bless top flight English Premiership!!
City couldn't breathe this entire match. Arsenal were on them like white on rice. City need KDB back asap.
I feel bad for Martinelli, in his position he has to face vinicious who is in full form for couple of years. Otherwise he should be the first choice for brazil national team
how tf did we stop the robot bro 😭
Time to sack Pep
I love it how some English truly believe that Julian Alvarez is anything more than a bang average player.
How’s that not a red card ?
Time to put ramsdale back in, first 3 mins were pure Raya mistakes. Saliba pocketed Halaand minute 4. And that should’ve been a red for kovacic. City are missing Rodri and De Bruyne so much in these big games. Halaand can’t do it without de Bruyne
What a boring match though
Jesus played a crucial part in this game by defending
Arsenal take over today
City losing to Arsenal, Haaland ghosting in another big game, without DeBruyne, City will fight for top 4. People comparing Haaland to Messi should give their heads a wobble
Scott Sterling!
Horrendous officiating best league in the world has the worst refs and var
It makes sense because they won without Saka.
Man City might win the  Premier League
Satisfaction 💪
City only lose to arsenal off of lucky deflections 😂
Fofen is so inconsistent. City needs KDB back in the worst way.
City was way better…lucky bumbs
Arsenal started the game being respectful and too cautious of their opponent. Get well soon Saka, welcome back Gabriel Martinelli!
But on another note, the emirates would be silent if Mr. Assist wasnt injured 🤫
Doesn’t matter,it’s marathon,City will win the Championship
Rodri’s importance to this City team was glaring today
Beautiful goal Arsenal for life
Gabriel - Saliba is the best CB duo in the league. Bullied Haaland for 90+ 😊
Martinelli with an excellent sub appearance, what a player
Any who keeps saying the PL is a farmers league should just stop watching football. Title will be heavily contested this year by 4-6 teams 🔥🔥
Is it any surprise how much better Arsenal looked when they took Nketiah off?  Useless player, doesn’t deserve to start
Goofy as haaland got bodied
partey is the key
The last 4 passes that led to the goal were made by the 4 substitutions made by arteta 👍
Pep need to realise that Haaland is not a big game player, big team will not give him space for easy tap ins
Aaand myy hearrrt will leaavve youu nevaaa
Man City looked cooked lmao wtf was that
If Jones got a red card, kovacic deserved a red
What a team congratulations 🍾
I had a grilled cheese sandwich today
Deflection club
I very happy my spurs are top of the league. I’ve good feeling this is Spurs year. What a good time to be alive!!!
When Haaland is not scoring, what does he offer??? I want to know. Letting Gundo and Riyad go was always gonna affect this City team as was obvious again today. Forget about De Bruyne for a second. City aren't that side no more.
Hey Haaland you dropped this 👻
WE winning the league (yeah Ik I said the samething last yr) let me have this
God bless the world and you all as well
Crazy how city is still in the top 2 of the table without de bruyne. Just shows how crazy that squad is
Why are we not discussing Arsenal under celebrations? 😂 the boys were cool 😎
How is Curtis Jones foul a red but kovacic isnt
Unlucky for Ake and City but well done to Arsenal, Martinelli really deserved that goal 👏🏾
Commentator speaks about Arsenal's 12 defeats "at the hands of Manchester City." Wouldn't they more correctly be at the "feet of M. City?"
The Guuunnnneeerrrssss💪💪💪💪💪
Great job by the substitutions for Arsenal goal. The whole play was touches by the 4 players that came in.
Huge win for the Gunners.
Clear red card 💀
Arsenal is lucky there owner kdb wasn’t playing today or else we all know what would have happened
VAR is now the best comedy on tv!!!
No red card for Kovacic?????how this decision compared with Liverpool Curtis Jones last week??? what's joke for VAR!!!!
Michael Oliver is a disgrace and Arsenal are owed an apology
The thing about arsenal is they always try to walk it in
what a fluke of a goal.
William Saliba was arsenal’s demise last season.
were was haaland today? Pisspoor performance.
How did man city get biased refs and still lose😭😭💀
Arteta outdid Guardiola. Holy fudge!
Mikel is having a dang field day with this win against Man City 😅
Mikel is having a dang field day with this win against Man City 😅
Close game, arsenal with a couple of better players in key positions
HISTORIC WIN for The Gunners, who are now unbeaten for 8 games straight The pupil succeeds in beating his former teacher Arsenal fans get a brand new song to sing The Cinderella story continues for Arteta and his battalion Lived dangerously on some occasions but WHAT A GAME and WHAT A DISPLAY 💪 NEW documentary to be made please!
Even though arsenal won, kovacic should have been sent off. The first yellow could have been a red, and the second foul was 100% a yellow card.
Lucky win lol. That's football for you though...
Oil City losing to Arsenal and making Spurs and Arsenal in the top 2 💀
Saliba guy was immense he shutdown Erling. Where did they get him amazing prospect
Raya doesn’t need to start
This game made me lose not just $300 that I place on the bet but $ 4,588 that I could have won in a ticket that I pick 11 teams and I even place a double chance bet on city that is either win or draw. I was only waiting for Fc Porto which have just won at the time of writing this comment and next Barcelona( though they have conceded a goal one minute when the game started but there is still a lot of time and sporting Lisbon and these teams are playing against bottom teams which gives them 90% chance of winning..
“Could THIS be the day!?” It’s football. Anything is possible 👏🏾
So Diaz and Jota get sent off but Kovacic doesn’t?
That's a crazy non red.  WHU fan speaking.
Tottenham is still number one!! Sonny is number one too!!🎉🎉🎉👍
Just because we won, let’s not forget the shameful refereeing decisions that went against us. Something’s got to change with the PGMOL!
When I started following Arsenal, it was the Wenger era, and each time they played City, they won. I had the feeling that James, the City Goalkeeper then, dreaded playing Arsenal. Times have changed, City is the dominant one thanks to those deep Middle Eastern pockets.
ah, martinelli nso shot b3n nono
Host
THIS IS A STATEMENT WIN. What impressed me most was how Arsenal did not panic after scoring the goal. They kept their composure and saw the game through. This might be the season that Arsenal becomes Premiership champion again. The signs are there: Firstly, they beat Everton at Goodison Park after about 6 years. Secondly, they beat Manchester City for the first time since the 2015-16 season. Once they figure out how to avoid a meltdown towards the end of the season, nothing can stop them.
That was a red card to any other team.
As a Tottenham fan, I'm in the awkward position of saying thank you arsenal 🙏🏻
Arsenal still having to look up...at the mighty Tottenham.
Idk who Arslan won cuz they have weak defenders who put the goalkeeper in a bad position by passing the ball back to him.
with a Good striker like toney or osimhen and a CM arsenal will be deadly
Credit to Mikel Arteta with the team selection, brutal sub at half-time and the three impactful changes late in the game. Declan Rice easily the best player on the field today.
Arsenal got a lucky goal
Saliba bodying Haaland in the first half to prevent the break away is my favorite play of the season so far. COYG
Arsenal won without Saka! Crazy game. Proud of Arsenal and their fans.
Thomas partey changes the game
How kovacic did not get a red card is still unbelievable. But good win Arsenal.
Isn't Oliver getting Paid by the People who own Manchester City?
Kovacic not being sent off is again more evidence of corruption.
Justice for football today. We just want any other team besides Manchester City to win the league. Hopefully Chelsea will finish mid-table too
My biggest criticism of Arteta, especially in comparison to Pep, has been that he doesnt know when/how to organize his substitutions for maximum effect. Today I am very happy to have been proven wrong. 4 subs combined for a beautiful sequence which (with a bit of luck) created a winning goal. COYG ❤❤
Man City needs midfielders badly, Lewis is nowhere close to being ready for prime time. He is still young though.
Shows how important Rodri is for city definitely should be a contender for balon D’OR
Golazo aké
Kinda gives me arshavin vibes vs Barca
Declan Rice was a Monster as well today. What a signing.
I’m failing to see why only was stopped w Rico’s goal both teams kept playing
ARSENAL ARSENAL ARSENAL ARSENAL
VAR is a bust
Partey master class
MAN CITY HAVE FALLEN
Michael Oliver tried to rob us first half 😂😂😂
Gabriel and Saliba both put in a great performance today in shutting down Haaland. COYG
Matchfixer City mad af rn
As a neutral I must say this was one of the worst games of football I’ve watched in a long time! Pathetic display by both teams!
Love to see these clueless refs explain how jones and gusto get sent off yet kovacic doesn’t. The officiating is horrible.
Wheres saka
League is ours to Lose thanks City 😂😂
Martinelli deserved the moment. He was working hard, sprinting back on defense all game.
Raya cannot pass
as hard as michael oliver worked for city today, arsenal still got the win over the 12 men. well done.
That was no yellow! That's a red!
So glad my team won but i think Raya (goalie) will be talked to in the locker room 😅
If that was Xhaka instead of kovacic it would have been a straight red🤦‍♂️
Happy for the Gunners👏🏻
City really miss Rodri!
🎉Good game🎉🎉🎉
The first half really made me want Ramsdale to come back in goal.
And why are they taking a knee again?!?!? Don't they know that in the USA (where this whole farce started) that BLM has been exposed as a money grabbing scam??
football is beautiful
Rice is worth 150 million
The Big Norwige is nothing without Prince Harry.
Raya doesn’t look any better with his feet than Ramsdale
Arsenal if u don’t win the league now it’s either now or never, I don’t mind if u win it as long as u can take advantage of this win, if u don’t win the prem the win meant nothing, so take advantage of it
Wow arsenal got lucky with the deflection. To be fair they had more chances in the second half.
city deserved to win unlcuky game
Spurs fan wanted draw but not bad
Wow. For such a hyped game, that was awful to watch.
coyg!
🔥
Win or lose the title i just wanted to finally get past this team
We re on the right track 👣 to win 🏆 this year's Premier League
What's the song that the fans are singing at the end?
watching the highlights to make sure i wasn't going crazy for no reason during the game
Bro i am soo happy. I've been waiting for this day.
"It was always gonna happen and now the Gunners have made it happen."
GET IN
HAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH LETS GOOOOOO
Arsenal really improved
city need to wake up. yeah rodri and kdb were missed, but they just dont look hungry. its clear who wanted it more, especially in the 2nd half
They kept the wrong striker js
The student gains the upper hand over the master.
It’s a long season we all know this and city will push till the last day
Where was haaland at?
This game was intense
Idk man I think Ramsdale should still be the starting keeper in league.
i'm a tottenham fan trhrough and through but nothing gives me more joy than watching oil money cheats lose a match :)
curtis jones getting a red but kovacic not?!!?!😞
As an honest Manchester City fan since 2008, Pep Guardiola should get out of my club! Losing 2 PL games in a row is unacceptable!
3:10 is a straight RED, and shortly after the tackle on Rice is at least a yellow making it a Red for Kovacic. Oliver is a bum.
Say what you want about me, but I can see Arsenal going the league season unbeaten again...
Imagine if Xhaka made that Kovacic tackle
Micheal Oliver should be suspended.
Keep Havertz out of the midfield and play him at Striker! He was solid off the bench today.
Ramsdale has no future in Arsenal. Maybe it's time for him to join in MLS now.
The emirates went fire. Deserved win tbh
No Rodri or KDM - excellent time to take advantage. Better tram selection by Arteta and the boys showed the fortitude to get the job done.
CONGRATULATIONS GUNNERS. Statement made❤️
Feels bad for ake
did haland touch the ball all game/?
GABRIEL MARTINELI IS A GEM BRO
If Arsenal could just keep Nketiah far off the pitch, we'd be a legit top team in the world
feel bad for ake man he played good all game jus to have the ball blasted at his face for the losing goal 😭😭
MY CLUB ❤ MONSTER MARTINELLI 🫡
Saliba rocking Martinelli lmao
Congrats to Arsenal. Michael Oliver being allowed to get paid by the UAE and then referee City games is insane. Clear conflict of interest, no conspiracy required.
Ake messed up in 2 games and the only 2 city lost. giving the space and time for havertz to lay the ball off
City showing massive respect to an opponent. Glad to see a good tactical match. Much respect to city today. Arsenal just wanted it more today. Both teams match up equally.
Partey too good with his vertical passes
Y'all were fast today with the highlights 😂
Forget that silly Exorcist movie coming out, this right here was the real exorcism of the week.
COYG!!!!! 🔴⚪️🔴⚪️🔴⚪️
Seems Haaland wins league, but not game
me running to go watch the highlights and dropping everything after receiving the news that arsenal actually won against man city!
Ghostland 👻
Definitely should've been a red card for Kovacic...
The title race this year is going to be super interesting!
Oliver with an absolute MARE.
Partey, Tomiyasu, Havertz, Martinelli -- 4 subs ALL involved in the winner!
Partey long ball, Tomi nods it to Kai, Kai lays it off for Martinelli. The subs are cooking.🤌🏼🔥🔥
meanwhile KDB to injury: let me play!
Kovacic really got away with TWO red cards, only got a yellow lol. Arsenal dominated today 🦾
is it too late to be an arsenals fan 😅
This game showed how important martinelli and saka are. Feel happy for havertz he must have more confidence after this
RICE MAN OF THE MATCH! What a player! 🍚
SALIBA AND GABRIEL OWN HAALAND!!🤌🏼🤌🏼
Arsenal is just incredible such a joy to watch. Am so happy and we  deserve it. We will win the trophy
Man city couldn’t stop the Arsenal scrap!!! COYG ❤
Jesus was an engine throughout the whole game, Saliba and Gabriel kept the robot at bay, and Martinelli was an instant impact. Incredible game Gunners!
LETS GOOOOO!! GUNNERS!
Let Arsenal have this victory, Man city are playing for a bigger victory. There’s levels to this
Kovacic not being sent off is insane
The tide has turned!
WHAT A DAY TO BE A GUNNER!
Thomas Partey doesn't do sideways passing. Always trying to hurt the opposition. Dude is a monster!
Suprise Martinelli
Huge, Havertz played well, the defense was SOLID! COYG
This shows how city misses KDB, Rodri and Stones in the midfield. Arsenal finally breaking their curse against man city 😂😂😂
man city in the mud😂
Tapaland
Manchester United forever!
COYG🔴⚪️
Fair play to Arteta for the subs, finally, finally we have beaten these bums in the league. Rice superb, Gabriel and Saliba superb defensively, the best LW in world football Martinelli with the winner, Raya a bit shaky but no one cares about that right now. Big win!!!!!
oh yeah
