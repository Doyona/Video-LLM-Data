Tank better than me . I would’ve ended the interview .
Jim Gray is a L in this moment. USA is built on 2nd Amendment
Where'd they find this guy?
Good on the interviwer. No need for that glock reference.
White man 💪🏻
Tank is a good guy
It was boxing till someone got political
the interviewer new damn well what tank meant. He just chose to ruin Tank's moment just to virtue signal. Also, the shooting that he was referring to was carried out with an AR Rifle. Not a glock handgun. What a moron.
Jim Gray is grade A fkn clown
Dertank💚💪👍🏼
This is honestly the best current fighter.
Unnecessary all the way around. Do the interview!
I’m not saying the interviewers comment wasn’t unnecessary lmao but all of y’all saying he was playing dumb he ended the statement by saying “I know you’re just meaning this in terms of boxing” Bro just doesn’t like any type of gun talk
I’m not saying the refs comment wasn’t unnecessary lmao but all of y’all saying he was playing dumb he ended the statement by saying “I know your just meaning this in terms of boxing”
Someone get that interviewer off tv
Jim gray should be ashamed of himself, that was absolutely disgusting trying to make an issue out of nothing when he absolutely knew what tank meant
retire Jim Gray already man
This reporter is straight up a hypocrite. Acting stupid as if he didn't understand what Tank meant. Mouth Slap worthy
This pisses me off bcuz people go to a boxing bout to get away from all that political BS and this Jim dude goes in and says that. Stfu and let the fighters have there moment. Frfr. Tank shoulda called him out there for talking politics
Damn. Tank is really a class act.  So respectful.  I love this dude!! Literally my favorite boxer ever
He from he new what he meant that’s the whole point why people  be like putcha guns up pith’s guns up talking about his hands bffr
Dude looks like long lost brother of sleeppy joe! lmfao😂
Jim interviewing in one of the most brutal sports acting soft as cotton.
Imma be honest, I get the vibe that Jim Gray really likes and respects Tank and I think that he was thinking he was looking out for Tank by saying that, when actually he made it worse because it’s going to be some idiots who are going to be quick to say that Tank was being insensitive and disrespectful by saying that. Tank is a humble and respectful dude. Inspiring actually.
Yeah Grey needs to shut his mouth with the side comments. He shouldn’t even be allowed to do that at work.
Lets not talk about guns, but I bet this guy was pro-Iraq invasion😂, Hipocrits. You killed millions of civilians... SHAME ON YOU, LEAVE TANK ALONE HE IS A LEGEND, A TRUE BOXING CHAMPION 🏆
Rip❤
Jim is such a nerd wow
This mfer really tried baiting the viewers into thinking tank was being ignorant with the glock comment. Thats wild seriously.
But in all the shorts and TikTok’s they don’t put tank correcting himself after the gun comment
If you're looking for the "aint no safety on my glock comment" it's at 3:41.
He  shouted out russel brothers old man thats whats up
Jim Gray sucks! For correcting Tank
Gervonta should have told announcer to shut up 😂 vibe killer tf 😅
Ain’t no safety on this Glock is such a badass line.
This is when he inner mayweather should have came out and said “im i interviewing you? Or you interviewing me?” And checked him but tank is a chill dude and let it slide.
This that dude at the bar to talk about polictics. Mans lame af nobody wants to see him do interviews. Take him out 🤦🏻‍♂️ so aggravating
Ain't no safety on this dick.
Jim Gray is outdated and has one multiple occasions made comments that were unnecessary. This is no exception.
Soft ass liberals
03:03 I know Romero did a lot on medía showing he was far more superior than what happened to him.  I think he deserves respect from the medía to be part of.  He ironically b.s. Romero but Tank Stays Very Professional.
Pause, Gervonta didn’t know what happened? With the shootings lmao. He thought the Jim Gray was referring to “the Russell bros” I’m dead
y’all needa fire this mf
This guy should never do an interview again… he clearly wanted tank to be cocky and arrogant to ruin his own moment and he didnt bite.. so he then he proceeded to make that gun comment… he clearly doesnt like tank as a person its clearly visible and its honestly disgusting and pitiful…
tank started stuttering 😂😂
Jim Gray just needs to go
Wow. What a vibe killer. We live in America and it’s completely fine to talk about guns.
Jim Gray ruins everything
Tank raised his hand. “Hold up you with the feds”😂😂😂😂
He was super respectful this guy is a pig
Crazy ppl think they can tell ppl what to say and think. I’d request this coward to never interview me again
SMH Announcer need to be replaced ASAP
A Glock has 3 safety’s 🤨
Jim gray is definitely my least favorite interviewer ever. That guy really sucks at this job of interviewing fighters. I look forward to when he’s no longer doing it.
America has became to sensitive. You can’t call a person a c&&n on Instagram without being flagged, but we can call each other ni$$a 🤦🏾‍♂️ Take back control people 🙏🏾
People that look like tank don’t do those type of things
Tank carrying the next era of boxing with humbleness and humility is the next best thing this world can get.
Ain't no safety on this glock!!!...fuckin luv u bro
Tank: My hand is money and I have a fat wad a bills   Interviewer: Lets not talk about money right now due to the blatant wealth gap that has kept a majority of this nation's citizens feeling completely hopeless
What a clown
That idiot commentator hates his countryman’s rights!  His comments are incredibly bias and not credible over and above the disrespect to the champ.  Fired for viewership judgment!
This is what they want let's stay away from guns 😂
I just watched the pre fight interviews and tank was clearing referring to his comments he made about being in the trenches and bullets flying cuz Romero was talking too much shit
Ole Jim just had to try to ruin the mood to "try" and control the emotions.  Take notes 📝 youngsters, don't let these guys phase you.
Lolllllll
Glocks don’t have a safety lol 😂 they have a safety built into them that is disengaged once the trigger is pulled. This man must not know his Glocks on not own one.
Lmaooo we need the “ ain’t no safety on this Glock “ tee’s 😂
That dumb confused old guy is a real life Twitter bot. That’s not a man anymore that’s an actual bot now. The programming is complete
Wow tank ignorant as hell lost all respect for him can’t wait till Ryan Garcia knocks him out
Arrogant
If this is boxings future its so fucked. UFC is so much more entertaining in every way.
Whatever makes headlines I guess right🤷
So we don’t suppose to talk about guns or see guns…. Well guess what there are thousands of cops that showcase their weapons everyday
3:47
First of all 😂 Tank ain't the one running into schools and killing the kids 💀
Get that mf out the ring 🤣 Nd never bring his ass back again 🤷
Bringing politics into boxing 😂
This is what you’re looking for 3:48
first it happened with money mayweather and now tank. getting outta hand honestly
Judging by Jim Gray's speech policing and hooked nose... There are some logical conclusions that can be drawn here...
they need to replace these old heads😑
This is Gervontae shining moment in my opinion. Another win with a bonus to stopping the reason for his annoyances.
They need to get rid of that old ass dude still interviewing fighters and speaking to them  black fighters in a tone like it’s the damn 1950’s. Get someone younger understands the language the people speak today.
https://youtu.be/Dp11DjaUc5A
If anyone is “outraged” over his “glock” metaphor, instead of fussing over words, how about you focus on your gun laws & how lunatics can access guns, how people can buy multiple guns without raising eyebrows, how American guns are found in South America - how does a manufacturer’s guns get in the wrong hands?  Focus on how corporations have hijacked your government & what you as people can do about it …  By the way, my government is a shambles as well.  This is a black kid who now fights professionally after growing up in Baltimore.  I must confess though that growing up in tough areas or areas with high crime rates tends to be conducive to street-wise characters.  Your anger is misdirected if you take issue with his comment.  To those who get it, well played 👏
Joe Biden looking ass😂
Fkk  this NATION!!!!! He would of NEVER said that to a champion  WRESTLER! Uuuuugh! Wytpipo  ALWAYS stealing a moment 😠 😡
You can tell he’s dehydrated… But besides that we all Love Tank because he’s sooooo humble and cool.
Class act
This interviewer WHO are YOUUUUUUUU? That dude need to retire. Just terrible!
Champ with a class and attitude🔥👏
He is so darn likeable on top of his mad skills .
Simple... He's a Romero fan ..... Simple
let’s stay away from misunderstanding what niggas mean! Goofball
Jim Grey is the epitome of GOOFY!! Can't wait for the day one of these boxers grow a pair & put him in his place like how Floyd & Bhop repeatedly did Larry Merchant smh 🤦🏿‍♂️
he a white man cut him some slack lol
Tank is a likable guy, probably the reason why he doest gel well with Floyd. Give him some media-training and he will take over!! other then that he brings skills, KO’s, drama, jokes etc. to the sport of boxing. Its Tank, Haney and Shakur for me. No disrespect to the other fighters though. However people criticize Tanks opponents but I have yet to see the other fighters taking it up against Rolly and Pitbull Cruz🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
Great Boxer and very exciting fighter to watch!!!
Keep Jim Grey away from these fighters.. what a BS move with that BS
Wtf is wrong with jim grey? He seems to act stupid a lot in post fight interviews.
Yeah I agree with the other comments,  there wasn't any need for the post fight interviewer to turn the straight forward analogy Gervonta made with feeling primed and ready to take on anyone like unlocked gun primed and ready with the recent shooting that made headline news in the US and around the world, it was an unnecessary negative over a harmless analogy. But all credit to Gervonta he turned the negativity straight into a positive, as great men do.  I wish him even more greatness, he is a true warrior of a man, he is one tough man, fuckin tough.
He's the people's CHAMP!
He knew what the heck tank meant, I absolutely hate when guys without an ounce of talent try to dim the the light of somebody else’s success. Screw him keep knocking them out tank.
I like this young man, im a fan for life!
Idiot. That announcer dude didn't have to say that. U can tell tank Is a guinely good dude
dude cant even use a metaphor
Get somebody else to interview, someone younger and who understands the culture, his time is over…let’s go Tank!!!
I love davis always giving thanks to God
"as much as I wanted to be cocky, I want to thank rolly and his team."  .. After he pushed him off the stage on principle, for being a clown. Then ko'd him.  How can you not love this kid. Everything from the ❤️
Fuck the haters Tank made that lil ass boy look very stupid,by whooping his ass
This guys a class act. He thanked his opponents team. Great job.
Tank, Glock's Jam! Say "Sig Sauer!" Instead.
Tank Davis is Still Undefeated World Champion!🇺🇲🥊🎯🔥😎🍷👍🤑
Tank has come a long way. You can see and feel the maturity. Big ups champ.
Good fight. When you walk into a punch . you don t have to throw it hard. Just make contact.
Jimmy, now why would you ruin the vibe. You know damn well what Tank meant.
The interviewer made it so awkward, jus let tank vibe, fool
Rapidly becoming my favourite of all boxers. BIG UP TANK. 🥊🥇
He blew my mind with his humbleness 🤗🥰
: is that rollo, on the mat doing the yaw, pitch and roll manuver after lunging into a left, is that him in the fog holding on to the referee for support to stand? so what happened?! who got cha?! why ain't he talking so much?! what number gear was that?! *these questions will be put to him when he returns from the limbo..
Tank is tank
Tank has really grown
Keep winning champ please don’t end up like AB ok he got entirely too cocky.. And stay taking  L’s
Tank gives God all the glory and God will  glorify Tank Davis.
Once again this is an instance when a white person really ain't hip to the context and lingo!
Everyone knows he didn't mean anything by saying his Glock!!!! Commentator made it more than it was! SMH
We can own as many guns as we like but can't make references about guns. Stop the madness. I lost a love one to gun violence at 5yrs old in front of me. Grow up joined the military and was in Iraq with a gun at 19yrs old. No one should be made to feel bad for talking the way they talk. If that be the case everyone would have to be silent because there will always be someone offended.
*rollo runs into a  cruising tank and is delivered to the  grey zone in 6..
Still king of the weight classes Mr gervonta 👑💜♥️🌎💯 undisputed sorry for not being on time but you're my dog and I am  extremely happy with the execution  style ending the fight that's the way we do love and respect From mike  💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰
Very good fighter
What Tank means when he says”ain’t no safety on this Glock” is anybody can get it. Just like bullets don’t have a name on them…but you still get hit.
That man wasn't even genuine he looked like he lost a bet or something, tank handled everything right tho
What fight ?, that was one of the most boring and over paid confrontation I've seen . The sport is boxing, not track ..........Davis was scared to get hit , & Rolly was too .
He should say what he wanted to say he don't need no side guy telling him what not to say about guns
Fuck Jim Gray, he tried to bait tank into talking shit about Rollie then accuse him of being insensitive.
I'm watching Mayweather fight Tenshin Nasukawa
He looks like a kid that wanted that laughter acknowledgment on the gun comment
There was no need for the commentator to say the let's stay away from guns comment, it was all in fun, tank of course meant nothing by it but he took his joy and ruined the whole interview by trying to embarrass tank, he should have just cut tank off a little bit and sent it back to the studio instead of calling him out
Rolly was Cursing, very disrespectful no class ignorant! And it was all okay with all of you! Tank put this loud mouth 🍆😵 to sleep 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂 WE will NEVER let Rolly the pole dancer live this down, ever 😵‍💫🤯😜🤮🥶🤪🤥🤥🤥🥊🥊🤒🥵
He look like he didn't throw a HARD PUNCH TO ME but he was right about it was a KNOCK OUT 😴 he didn't know until he WOKE UP
DALE LA REVANCHA A PIPBUL QUÉ NO LO PUDISTE NOQUIAR
This old fart killed my vibe as well
Dude sound so humble good fighter 👏 keep it up bro
Congratulations👑
Fera
HE SAID "HE DIDNT THROW THAT HARD" THEN SAID "HE DEFINITELY GOT POWER" IN THE POST FIGHT PRESS CONFERENCE
They need to replace this guy conducting the interview. I watch sports to get away from the horrible things that go on and he ruined it by taking it there!!
I totally  agree with  Dovahkin's comment.  It was NOT his place to say that to Tank. The  kid meant absolutely no harm in what he said. I bet you he wouldn't have said anything if blacks were being slaughtered all over the place or if it was a pro-abortion comment. Who made him the speech police?
Pushing Rolly off stage isn't humble and thanking Mayweather for cheating pitbull Cruz enough Said no excuses gervonte warmed up or not he earned them shots you ate lol
Rolly is Chiney fr..Just shut up and work on ur craft instead of being a whole for attention..Floyd will pimp him to build up young guns now..He may get one more big fight n if it ain't close he goes back to super under undercard..Fun Clown out respect that Like Paulie say he k ew he started boxing late and has to play catchup..That means he has to spend 2 as much time working on his defense first than offense..He only has 50 fight including the a Amateurs..Comon..He loses to everybody in the top 6 or 7..Even Richarx Conmey wud get him..
Jim Gray said he knew, but he made that statement...   And the reason for such stupidity is that people are selfish. He has no doubt interjected complete nonsense many times before in the hope of hitting the Jackpot with one sentence that becomes iconic and in-turn makes him a lot of cash and a reference of note in sporting history.    Tonight, he should have kept his ignorant f#cking mouth shut!
That was some bullcrap he knew Gravante wasn’t referring to the mass shootings 🤦🏽‍♂️ he just had to put his 2 cents in and kill the young man’s vibe
I check for my wallet every time I see the guy with the white suit on behind them....
My man tank!! Proud of u young brother!!
These fkn liberals are such whiny sensitive pussies. They gotta ruin everything “ let’s not make gun comments with this sensitive time “. Dude stfu
Tanks grown on me massively in the last year ! Matured tenfold and Humble ? He's turning into one of the greatest around 135 lb ..up and down the Division's ? Well done Tank Lad.. Respect.. England..
Tank is king , that was so funny when he pushed  rolly
Tank has humbled himself alot - got a new fan here
Yea put tank on the spot like he was his father let the man speak it’s freedom of speech if that with iron Mike he wouldn’t have done that
Is this man so dumb he gave that killer so much promotion by mentioning that everyone knew that tank was referring to boxing SMH
That Jim the commentator should be fired or just shut the fu*k up! Let tank celebrate is knock victory!!!
No no no. Don’t put politics or race into my sport.
Instigating Hard!
They need to get these old crusty white dudes outta the way always trying to kick up some bs and take stuff outta context and bring that negativity smh. Tank was being hella humble and respectful and he just couldn't take it just ask real straight up questions and then stfu.
Reminds 1 of the Crawford/ Brooks fight & gives a perfect play out for the Crawford/ Sprintz fight .All the story lines said abt this fight is the same as the Bud / Error fight,he too strong for tank,he got pwr, he gonna walk tank dwn & get himself into a short well timed without much effort( I didn't throw it hard) shot.,whose next.Tank a big guy,if he made it to say the 9rd I could see a rematch but 6 'NO'😭
Jim gray knew what tank meant get him outta here like Jim lampley both get on my nerves
Them sideburns tho 💀
Announcer: Let's stay away from guns. Meanwhile in Ukraine.. let's help them with the fight against Russia. stfu... this is beyond me.
Jim gray on some bullshit here
Comment section is filled with Tank's Dick Riders Fan Club.
More mature Tank he is more dangerous 👍
GLAD FOR TANK ND HES SEXY😘❤😘💯👊
WHEN TRASH TALK GOES WRONG 💯
LOVE ME SOME TANK  💗💗💗
Hate the way this man interviews people  fucking dry zombie!
JUST IMAGINE THAT TANK HAD OF HIT HIM WITH ONE PF HIS POWER SHOTS IT WOULD OF BEEN LIGHTS OUT 😴😴😴😴
It's been an awful time in this country from day one. Tank should have checked him.
Tank hides who he is well in the interviews.  He has a bump the size of an apple on his head and is lucky they didn't make him finish Rolly.   This fight with Rolly should be runned back sometime after  Tank fights the winner of Kambosos Haney and Rolly gets a couple more fights under his belt.
this guy is a class act!!! rescpect
Guns don’t kill people, stupid MF’s with guns kill people
Politically correct bullshat!! All that gun activity has nothing to do with Tank and his win...🤔🤦🏾🙅🏾🤦🏾😑
His adjustments the volume level of at a low and them turning up the bass as the fight went on, tank defense game not including that left is emaculant.
Yea tank should’ve been like man whatever
Man he dominated you the whole fight. You landed a shot. Give the man his credit though
Imagine if instead of left hand hook was a right power hook, rolly still sleeping by this time 😴😴😴😵😵
He made me a good £4600.00 betting 😘😘😘
Guns are on the News in America every day. I lived through the Vietnam War every day for 10 straight years. The WAR WAS ON THE TV on 8 of the 12 Channels was of WAR and the DEATH COUNT of fallen soldiers, Tanks, Boomer Aircraft, and GUNS was in front of me. Thank The Lord Jesus Christ my MOTHER TURNED YOU OFF !!! Please tell your People to REPORTER to GIVE UP THERE GUNS and stop KILLING PEOPLE. But your history is FULL OF YOU MURDERING AND STEALING, BREAKING CONTRACTS, LYING, TAKING OTHER PEOPLES' LAND. GUNS IN BOXING? NOT SO. Go tell your people in your White House about them GIVING GUNS TO OTHER NATIONS. Not just GUNS BUT MISSILES, FIGHTER JETS. "GUNS" PLEASE REPORTER, you are STUPID.
He thank GOD. That is Good. My comment is the Gun. Surly the report did not have to make a comment back about GUNS because he should have realized they are talking about BOXING NOT GUNS that AMERICA LIVES Buy just like Russia and China, India, etc. Davis was talking about Boxing, not Guns.
Got to RESPECT A MAN WHO GIVE CREDIT TO GOD FIRST
Poor tank has bad CTE already sucks he needs to stop now before he ends up like Ali
Jim gray is such a party pooper That was so salty Negative VIBES 😒 😑
Everybody knew what he meant when he said “Ain’t no safety on this glock”  No disrespect to anyone who has lost members this year
Tank is a real champion. Such a class act, and an incredibly skilled and smart fighter. Respect for keeping it humble through all this drama the past month or so
I think him and Loma are best. If they box, I really don’t know who will win

I guess we can't mention guns unfortunately because people was killed, next they'll be saying don't talk about lemons because folks don't like lemonade.
Damn he made that so awkward
I love that saying!  There is no safety on this Glock ! Wow ! This Davis cat is one BAD MAN !
Mannn TANK should be getting nothin less than 40 mill A fuckin fight an that's still to low for the young supa star
I like Tank more now that mayweather isn't involved so much. Great move.
Yo Yo Great to see the Champ’s maturation process….Superb interview, Excellent Fight as usual, and he’s really embracing what’s laid out before him as a champ! #Well Played #He’s not a businessman, He’s boxing Business Man!!
Yo dude I thought y’all want goodguys with guns 💪 he a good guy bitch
Such a humble person 💯🙌🏾
The interviewer seems to get his satisfaction outta instigating negativety when Tank was clearly trying to show great sportsmanship.
habang tumatagal umiiba na ugali ni tank. mas mabuti nga para malayo sya sa ugali ng amo nyang c floyd.. hindi na pera habol ni tank kundi legacy
Jim Gray is a legend in this sport, but that shit was uncalled for. You’re interviewing him he can say whatever tf he wants.
I’ve always found Jim Gray annoying like his questions. He’s better suited doing figure skating interviews.
Froid may weather and roid jones jr 💉💉💊💊 The whole TMT💉💉💉
Jim your people need to stay away from the guns. Guns aren’t the problem young, and middle aged white men are the problem. They are the ones commenting all the mass shootings. They’re the ones who should be banned from purchasing guns.
Say what u want he done been in some trouble but he ain't ever really acted a ass

Tank Davis your true sportsman and role model in boxing...Keep up good work..
Common bro Speak English right. Lol
Be humble ..
Tank is overrated. Isaak Cruz BEAT him. And Tank doesn't want a rematch.
Hats off, he’s humble, polite, and a win. Congratulations and thank you for the video.
Tank got no safety on that glock
Idk Tank for shit but that he can box.. but I like him, his genuineness and humbleness is undeniable.. he a good cat and a great fighter point blank
No safety on this GLOCK he meant it in a good way(sports wise) personally l liked it, the white man had make it POLITICAL (uncomfortable) let the man shine it was his night (condolences to UVALDE TEXAS FAMILIES)
These networks keep some stiff cheesy ass commentators  retire already!!!
The gun Reference was not necessary about guns it was about his fits  like why are you take it out of context and he just was competing in the Sport you were refer their hands to something.
He’ll be able to fight again in 90 days lol
We know what tank means about guns reference to his fist
"Ain't no safety on this glock"  He's talking about 1rst amendment not 2nd amendment. Just saying.
i dont like gervonta davis but gotta respect his boxing prowess. and that gun thing he doesnt mean anything by it. why that old guy telling him what to do?
Is it me or Tank a bit slow? And not in boxing terms.
DRY FAST FOR SEVEN DAYS AND YOU WILL BE WELCOME AT MY TABLE
Soo proud keep killing em we da truth they not
He was really reaching with that gun comment. Like, are you trying to make a headline or something? Loser
Jim Gray a cornball
Jim Gray took away Tanks moment with that non sense.
It surely seemed as if dude threw the fight🤷🏾‍♂️
Where is Max Kellerman when u need him
The Glock response was Just to let the future opponent know it's more punches his hands don't jam 💪🤙
In all the Time tank Always thank GOD always praise GOD..  You're the best tank Keep it up champ
Such a prick... Get rid of these type of announcers SHOWTIME!!!
ESNEWS BEST 🥊🥊🥊COVERAGE ON YT 🏆🏆🏆
Who are the Russell Brothers?
Confucius say Commentator needs not to give opinions during someone else's shine.
He saying if you dangerous you already know you dangerous
Whyte zaddy needs to talk to his people about 🔫 blacks are not the one shooting elders and innocent kiddos..
4:03 This socially-correct society is SICKENING and disturbing 🤬  The man was simply being metaphoric!  Why the fck is everything taken out of context, these days??!!!
Try thanking me that whipping I gave you in third grade changed you it made you hungry 🤤
And y he had to be extra bout the gun shit. Yo, aint no saftey on the glock! They will see each other again I think.
He handle that post fight interview with 💯 class
like he said "ain't no safety on this glock" he said it and meant it, let him keep his moment. he wasn't disrespecting anyone
He sounds like an idiot. “Amanition”
Wow..  Jim Gray...  C'mon man.
I think it's time to get rid of the old square white men in boxing interviews.  Plenty other people would do a better job.
Is he talking differently with those fake teeth?
Fk jim grey! I bet he ain't lived nowhere where he's heard gunshots on a regular while he was growing up (unless he was a hunter) who does he think he is, to tell somebody how to send a message!
Jim Gray is a clown. I absolutely cannot stand him. He looks like someone you'd see on To Catch a Predator.
https://youtu.be/kpJUv4gqALY
https://youtu.be/kpJUv4gqALY
Its about time showtime got rid of jimmy old ass he don’t even no shit about boxing
Nigga got the whitest teeth in the world
FIRE JIM GRAY !!
That announcer should not be interviewing the boxers he sucks and he’s obviously not a person with cool communication skills
Showtime should fire him he knows fuckall about boxing 🤣🤣something mayweather would say

Hey i didn't really pay attention to tank before he such a humble fighter he's going on the right path.;)
Lomachanko will wreck his sht....and the gun comment by the announcer was absolutely uncalled forbhe should be fired. ....but hey its free speech baby. MURICA...WE ON THE COME BACK.
Garcia better get his weight up ..that's the money making fight...it will be the most anticipated fight in a long time..this is what we need ,now give us what we want.
Boxing ain't real fighting
Jim Gray should take this same energy to some NRA Republicans who is making all the defense for assaults rifles .... stupees
Jim Grey just killed Tank’s victory speech. Dude has to take a seat for a while for that one. I don’t know what he was thinking!!! Come on man!!!
I hate when the host was trying to be extra. He wasn't talking about a real one. He was talking about his hand. Crazy! Stay in your lane Sir.

Jesus Christ loves you https://youtu.be/F2TSJgDh2tA
That was a pure class act on the part of Tank to foresake cockiness and acknowledge his opponent like that
Time is short   To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Rumble from the humble.
That was more than necessary!
In 2012, I almost died from a drug overdose but Jesus Christ saved my life.  During this near death experience, I cried out to the Lord Jesus in prayer and repented to Him for my sins and He saved my life.  Please repent to the Lord Jesus for your sins and then get fully submerged under water as a baptism to God in the name of Jesus and obey what He wants you to do with your life or if you don't do this then when you die you will go to hell.
Stupid reporter went woke on his moment to shine the man was referring to his hands what a stupid @$$ get paid to throw political shit in interviews when they can media is waked china pays ABC,NBC, CBS bills.

It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
Safety on gloc l.m.a.o
I want to see Davis get destroyed by canelo, since he wants to claim he’s better than canelo. If there’s anybody that could/would knock davis out in round 1, it’s canelo.
Class act🙏
Take away the one punch, and Rolly out classed Davis for 6 straight rounds.
Jim grey liberals like him will not let a tragedy go to waste .. !!
Tell me why would he come at this man about a comment that was not even intended towards what happened in those other situations. Unbelievable. Always raining on our parade. At least trying too.
Don't worry ,the one who starts talking crap ,will find himself on the other end of the punch ,with an opponent who reserves his ability to the ring , and not to the camera.
Gervonta did not expect Romero to fight him so hard from the beginning and offer him that resistance in the fight, he was a bit scared since he received a good blow closing the first round and at that moment he even wanted to spoil the fight by verbally provoking Romero (which shows nerve symptoms). He knocked Romero out with a "crazy thrown" punch in a panic, no technique, instinctively shielding himself with fear when he saw that Romero had him on the ropes...and he just got lucky combined with Rolly Romero's mistake.
cute kittens and Animals for When You are Stressed amazing video https://youtu.be/62QUR_n1-Hs
He is such a likable guy .... and a dangerous and tallented boxer!!!!!!!!!!! He is the champ and he deserves to be the champ!!!!!!
Jim that was as weak as it gets. You took that totally out of context. Our Nation is at War our Nation has been at War our Nation will continue to be at War for no got damn reason and you come with some BS like that. I lost a lot of respect for you.
I’m glad Tank ignored Jim asinine comment. Boxing has nothing to do with politics. Keep your views out of ring. Overreaching Tanks response. The old guys, announcers, judges, all need to hang it up. They are annoying asf!
One of Tanks mature interview, and Jim Gray had to mess it up, reaching out of context. Maybe it time for him to hang it up, old age, overthinking ish, reaching for things that aren’t even there. Jim made this moment irritating af.
Jim Gray screwed up and made it about the horrible tragedy that just happened in Uvalde, Tx. He’s probably trying push politicians rhetoric because he’s next job might be with CNN or Fox or one of them hypocrites channel!!
i like how humble grevonta is thats why his a champ the class of sportsmanship he has and he don’t talk that much lets his hands and amazing power do the talking for him thats why he is where he is at and i love the way he also humbles people too
I will never understand why boxing keeps these old white men in positions to interview these fighters right after the fight (Merchant, Gray). They ask the dumbest questions and make comments that are not respectable to a man that just had the heart to put his life on the line to entertain us. These boxing teams need to coach their fighters to check these dusty m’efers as soon as they say something stupid. He knew what that young man meant with the gun comment smdh…
Tf is wrong with that old white fool. You damn well know what Tank meant smh.
That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved...
If tank was white he wouldn’t have said that dumb shit gun laws. We talking boxing kid
Gervonte might be the next world champ on some mayweather shii 💪🏾🥊
Gervonta is a girl's name. Glad he uses Tank. And yup, not the smartest kid. Glad he can box. He didn't even know about the Uvalde, Texas mass murder, which is a good thing. He doesn't need that sadness. R.I.P Uvalde 😔 😟 🙁 😥  🇺🇸
what a lovely guy Davis is, genuine fella
Jim Gray needs to stop being a vibe kill. America has a gun problem, leave it out of the post-fight interview.
Man that's just something in Baltimore we say...A Glock don't have a safety ya dig..And if someone from Bmore says that......Duck MFER!..lmao
Punk ass man ruining his high trying make it seem like he said something bad about the gun comment when it was just a reference
Jim Gray has Always been scummy in interviews as long as I can remember.
Loma next Tank...xcited much here!
" Ain't no safety on this Glock " and that's why Tank said what he said !
People are saying Rolly done well… he lasted 6 rounds then got KO’d😂 that’s not doing well
Yuhhh
He kinda killed Tank’s vibe with that gun comment. That was unnecessary
Excellent interview brother.  God bless you.
Hi
Dude. That was one of the most badass quotes from a boxer after a fight and you step on it with something unrelated.
Echenle al Pitbull Otra vez para que el Mexicano lo Reviente.
Freedom of speech 🤣
I didnt like how spoilt tanks moment there,  he knew what tank was referring to he meant fighting in the ring so why bring the shooting up very awkward
get this old man off the mic.
Humble af man
Please rate The Bob's Burgers Movie 5 stars on Letterboxd
Gervonta vs Ryan is all we need to see!
This wasn't a fair fight. This poor kid Romero was a set up to make Tank look good. You will never hear from this guy ever again. Want to see Ryan Garcia and Tank. That would be a competitive fight.
Let's stay away from gun's. 🐵🐵
It's time to fire Jim Gray,or retire. Cause throwing that type of smut on tank's victory..Showtime needs to fire Jim for that B.S he brought  up.
I wanna see him putting ryan garcia like this
Showtime should fire Jim Gray, everyone knew what and how he meant it!
@showtinesports Jim was doing so good till he brought up that bullshit. Put a leash on your media Personel.
Mayweather production. Davis the beast
👍🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿👍👍💪
WHY SAY "LETS STAY AWAY FROM GUNS" BS WHEN EVEN HE SAID HIMSELF THAT HE KNOWS THAT HE MEANT THAT AS IN BOXING....HE SEEMS TO LOW KEY HATE ON TANK FOR SOME REASON....
Pit bull won .....he knows....
Crack!!!!!!
Everybody knew what he meant when he said “Ain’t no safety on this glock”  No disrespect to anyone who has lost members this year
Tank heart is pure you can tell congratulations on another W .Jim Gray we all know what's going on in the world Tank was talking about boxing Jim should of kept it on boxing he knew what tank ment by that ofcourse they would try to do that lame shit .#GTD
fkn white liberal trying to insert his gun control agenda on the boxer. gtfoh with that bs
Sure Racist Jim.... I'v yet to see a mass  murderer to look anything like Tank Davis!  They usually looks a Jim Gray's relative..
Floyd, let Tank enjoy his work! You had your day! You got your money! Sit back and sit down somewhere!
Killeen, Tx
good, now this clown can go to prison and rot where he belongs. he’s a woman beater, he hit and ran from a accident he caused while fucking drunk, he’s an all around tool. and yes i realize, he’s floyd’s little prodigy, i. do. not. care. dudes a clown.
Its like a homerun in baseball if you try load up and over swing hard your timing going be off" same here if he tried to throw it hard I guarantee you he would have been early like he was on missed upper cut took something off Boom perfect timing TKO.

Tank is a beast good win brother 💯
Stay away from guns? Stay away from your 2nd amendment right. Sounds stupid and condescending. That was metaphor Interviewer. Guns don't kill people do.
He didn’t even have to set him up. Just pure skill and discipline. That knockout punch was just a reflex.
The Glock reference just got me thinking of key and Peele asking kids to fly
Tank is going to put Ryan Garcia to sleep first round a one hitter quitter
Yeah like a pacmac awkward sneaky Punch 😜. 👍👊✌️ Rolly just rolled into that punch head on  😂😲😜
👋🏻
Davis an garcia make it happen !
That John Leguizamos son
But without one shot punch he never won

I love his chilled kinda fun interviews how he respond, he's a man. His punches good Lord "no safety on this clock"
https://youtube.com/shorts/gTPPM-OMtD0?feature=share
He definitely threw that punch hard he lying
Jim Gray. Take this L for bringing that gun tragedy up knowing damn well what David meant.
Freaking Jim Gray ... seriously 😒
You can't really ask for a better post fight interview. Very humble, respectful and honest. I've become a big fan of Tank.
YES THAT WAS A STR8 HATER MOVE BY JIM GRAY..HE SHOWED HIS TRUE COLORS..HE KNOW THAT MAN WAS TALKING ABOUT HIS BOXING GUNS..KNOCK IT OFF..GOOD JOB TANK WE SEE THROUGH THE B.S.GOD FIRST!!
Hey! Did you know God is three in one!? The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit! Bless them! Jesus died for our sins, rose from the dead, and gives salvation to everyone who believes in him and follows his commandants!  Have a blessed day, everyone! ❤
Davis will set you up every time if you move in too close and underestimate his power. Romero hits hard but he does not throw enough punches to beat Davis. I was waiting on Romero to throw more punches but he would throw one at a time. Davis waits for any moment he can get for you to slip and boom he hits you with that knock out punch. You can’t take nothing away from Davis because he has beaten and knocked out guys in that ring the same exact way. Romero needs to understand that he was beaten just like most of Davis opponents. You just have to do something different to beat Davis because this kid is special trust me. Don’t go in that ring thinking that your power is going to do it. Look the kid has Floyd Mayweather  on his team. need I say more.

I am do Davis fan, but he can back up the trash talking and appears to be getting more humble over time...I still look forward to the day someone beats him, but until then this was his night and he earned this one...
Bright  future  for  this  young man
Shouldn't have even mentioned the gun reference even though true boxing fans and most people with sense know he was referring to his hands keep moving forward tank💯💯💯
If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart the Father raised Him from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9
THE BEST AND HUMBLE CHAMPION CLOSE TO GGG...
It seems like his speech is starting to slow down don’t know if he’s taking too many punches
Tank is the truth
Dude talk like Tyson, WHAT??? Is this real?? America is crazy bro!!! All about the money flow.
THANK YOU Mr. Davis for deflecting all of that Rat/Snake’s tactics to get you to belittle your opponent or clown along with himself in your victory. You handled that and spoke of him just as you should. Well done
god the interviewer is a clown. you can tell he racist.
Everyone's a ko expert now stfu and enjoy the highlights
0:55 he turned on his face off  state, thats why he could not hear what he said
After enlightenment my thoughts were no more. No longer did I hear that voice of condescendence, of judgement. And that was the greatest relief of all. You are enlightened. You are integrated and complete. You are just having fun remembering this. And there are so many ways to have fun!
I new it tank davis was going to win congratulations gavanta 🏆
Jim Gray... stop it
😆😌👌🏻
Amazing! Tank thanked GOD first above all.. a shift of attitude to positive one.. I hate him previously, but love him now.. bravo!
Good man hope he stay focus ....
Luv this kid… stay humble and ready to rumble
The King of the Lightweights Humble in Victory My Favourite Fighter
Jim is a 🤡. Get him off showtime.
Tank should of decked that old man for the way he shot down his joke💯
Stop worrying about being so politically correct. For hells sake you sound like a
Disrespecting pacquaio? Prime pacquaio will demolish you
Freaking white interviewer thought he was talking about a real Glock 🤦‍♂️ he don’t know street talk at all

Great content 👌  But https://youtu.be/YwsU5vASGGA
Bruh his face while throwing that punch to rolly’s face says otherwise
The Guy with the Mic has No Class and is Low AF...Davis instead of being Cocky and arrogant,  decided to be humble, Honor God,and honor  his opponent for settling business like a man,In the ring. He could have acknowledged that, instead, he wants to try and make Davis look like a Bad guy still .....Get him off Showtime Boxing before the ruins it
Tank did exactly what his mom told him to do      Mom’s reaction…….. priceless
Tank a real pro props to his PR
Do you tank Rolly the fn man your a fn bum
Tanks obviously talking about his left hand not an actual glock Jim
The humility of a Champion...priceless. Congratulations superstar!
I have a ton more respect for tank to thank his opponent and talk highly of him I live for the sportsmanship as much as the action
Lucky the referee stops the fight if not the loser romero will get his head off.
👏👏👏 Catch and Shoot. Good timing!
I love this kids talent so much I just think that he has the tool to be anyone and just promoters holding him back
Ain’t no safety on this Glock I love it
Keep it up! I am dropping 1 song a week for the next 3 years straight. It has never been done in music. Come along for the ride if you want. Stay blessed !  - Bryan
Jim gray low blow , not cool !
I'm really happy for Tank ...he deserved it..
When gervonta was describing himself like a glock the Texas shooting didn’t cross my mind at all, Jim Gray is the one to ruin the mood and bring it up..this media will continue to jam gun laws down everyone’s throats and won’t be happy until a civil war breaks out over guns.
campeón deivis campeón 💪
Ok He brought up guns like they not legally sold or something and he said Glock the school was shot with a AR15 them suits I swear ….
Damn he hit that boy so hard and so fast rolly got up thinking he was on a  Molly. nah u just got hit wit one tho lol
👏👏👏👍
Silent killer generation tank Haney stevenson don't talk that much but they can fight
Im surprised it went 6 rounds. I predicted tank within 4. Rolly can take a punch tho. He got back up. Not the most devastating KO win of tank. He put barrios to sleep.
TANK IS THE BEST P4P FIGHTER RIGHT NOW 💨💨😤😤🤯🤯💨💨💯
This man has all my respect, from he said thank God
Showtime y'all need to get rid of old and "Gray".He is a horrible interviewer.Been the worse for years.
Great fucking interview
He knew what tank meant he probably a hidden racist who purposely tried put that false narrative out there to make people turn on tank
4RLs that blow wasn’t near a power punch 🥊 lol
هناك ملاكمين أضعف منه وتحملوا ضربات اقوى كيف يسقط من ضربه واحده وبهذه السهوله هذا يدل على انه لم يعد بالصوره الجيده
Jim Gray really had to mess up that bomb ass line “no safety on this Glock”. No need to bring up the tragedy bc no one in the crowed was thinking that
Jim gray is fucking ridiculous !!
He has a heart of a lion
Why tf did he relate his gun reference to what happened to those kids… he knew what Tank meant by his statement… what’s the point of even bringing that up? 🤦🏿‍♂️
What a humble dude
Good fight , stopped to early.
My dude has turned into a articulate professional boxer,, I'm very proud of him .
Uhhhh uhhh uhhhhh uhhhhhhhhh uh uh uh uh uh uhhh uhh uhhhhh uhhhh uh uh uh uhhh uh uh uhhhhh uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh uh uh.
Man what a class act showing love to his rivals father Rip Mr.Russell Sr
I C U SAM et ez GEORGE LOVING JACKSON
Jim grey was definitely on some 🍭💩. New Larry Merchant. Showtime better remember what happened to hbo. Congratulations Tank, you fought smart and got it done champ! Damn right "Ain't no safety on this Glock". 🦍 #TheOne
I never realized  that his teeth  rub and vibrate  against  each  other,  when talking.
I've noticed that the reporter in the ring is always trying to get the fighter to talk bad about his opponent and I appreciate that Davis kept his cool. I think it gives a bad impression to society to pursue some sort of demining narrative in order to cause some sort of controversy. It makes the community look bad and the honestly its discrimination. I've noticed how the questions change depending on the color of the boxer. like they want to make him talk shit when He is clearly trying to be humble and respectful. Maybe if society changes this, we can see people as equals instead as promotional content and give him more respectful question.
https://youtu.be/VmlDOf_Sor8
His name is MARQUEZ  and he would have beat the sh.. out of you  King Ryan will knock  you down
He’s actually a really chill dude. If that was Mayweather, he will probably start cursing  the reporter.
This Gray guy sucks
Tank barely touched him, and Rolly went rolly on the mat 💪
Smart Fighter who win
Man come on now if u knew what the man meant why u played that man like thats really
Hats off to the commentator on addressing the gun issues good job. 🙏
WOW!!! A 1 punch KO!!!!! Who do you guys want to see Tank and Rolly fight next?
Jim Gray wtf are you talking about this is one of the most violent sports in the world he just won a big fight…. just wanted to lil boy him
Big ups and respect to tank. Rolly back to the lab
Felt like slapping Jim for bringing up something that’s totally unrelated to the situation and just killing the entire vibe completely
Wtf is Jim Gray talking about someone needs to get rid of this guy this was a low blow you knew exactly what he met. Let the guy have his shine 🤦‍♂️

Tank is good like his skills
can Jim Gray just retire already! if athletes are expected to leave politics and current world problems out of sports then commentators and analyst alike should be held to the same standard.
he want pacman next
They hate to see us win or do anything good it kills them, that was so uncalled for his old racist ass new exactly what Tank meant he always say that and you no what he meant BUM.
Bro gotta be the most humble showboat of all time not too cocky just having fun and enjoying it
You don’t need a hard punch for a knock out. He. Got coughs on the temple
Does tank have fake teeth...
As humble as this man is why would you think he meant a real gun..a bunch of fighters talk like that cause their body is a registered weapon
Jim Gray is a 🤡
Growth, this is what it looks like, "I wanted to be cocky"... Cleared his mind and spoke like A true man/champion.
If you knw he's only talkin boxin terms then why bring it up at all.....
nahh is it just me or is davis seem to be degrading
I was a big fan before the fight but now He’s my idol. Gervonta is legit
Ngga ain’t no safety on this Glock like HE SAIDDD!!!!!
Respect to Davis on the way he handled himself in this post presser. He's definitely grown into a mature man that is good to see. He's got all the talent in the world. Definitely can't wait to see how far he goes
You mean Juan Manuel Marquez
Proud of you young bro , you getting better every interview 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
U c that he learned from the money man how to defend keep running and and frustrating his opp man the mental part of this game is so important nice work tank very smart fighter patience he left him self open twice and tank saw it the third time it was nite nite
Sweet knockout victory for Tank. Hopefully Garcia, Loma or the Kambosos vs Haney winner next.
No disrespect but they got to stop letting these 70 80 90 year old folks interviewing the new generation a Fighters because they're from the past they don't know how to keep it hype they always have some kind of dumb comment to say ruining just simple little Spotlight  there  just from a different era we need to let the new Young era be more involved in the interviews and judging the old era needs to know when to stop hang it up or just nothing nothing at all because it's different times no disrespect but watching the old man and interview tank davis  at the end and with little dumb reply comments was  weird boxing they need to give that job to a Young understandable of this time and talk and slang and fight to be interviewing Fighters to see somebody younger and more hype doing the interviews would just be way better on Showtime especially after a fight like this
The form Rolly had when he fell was what told me to do when I was a jitt learning to swim. I still can’t swim.
Exactly my thoughts it's like pac man ran into it with Marquez 😂
I just like to say I never noticed him but at this point I will give him all due respect I never fought before but I enjoy the sport he's one of God's Mighty black entertainers do it your way young black man this is your history the ring is a stage perform well bless you dearly🌹😇...
Respectfully, I’m glad he’s authentically “Tank”, and not attempting to be “Floyd”. He didn’t allow the arrogance to run off on him.   This is a good kid. I pray he remains humble.
Please let someone else interview fighters… after the fight Jim Gray time has come. And him reaching that low with the gun comment was unacceptable.
Tank still with mayweather ?
We all new what tank meant
THANKS TANK FOR THE WINNING  GOD BLESS  WE LOVE YOU BRO.
Jim Gray a Larry Merchant with no personality.
Ain't so safety on this glock
B.S.  The referee called the fight to soon.   This is why people don't spend money on pay-per-view.
Both have power, just one got caught with it. Look at there foreheads  Explains everything.
Of course they had to make it political lol
I like this interview. He wasn’t too cocky , he gave straight forward answers he did his thing ! 💯💯
Tank always keeps it real
Who's romero?????I never c hem???that Romero is a pounch bag....runner tank fight nice 😀....because last fight with pitbull tank was running.....
“He’ll be able to fight again in 90 days” 😭😭😭😭
Romero wasn't ready dude is sloppy he needs more training. Leaves himself open too much
#Tank is a beast! Whose next?
I dislike Jim's fake smile
Keep fighting Cherrys 🍒🍒🍒😅😂👎
Let's stay away from guns....🤔  Jim Gray and his mainstream antics of censoring free speech for their continuous fear mongering campaign.
Glock ain’t got no safety
Jim Grey we would call him a wanker in the UK.
Jimmy is a clown for that, taking away the moment from Davis and trying to tie his statement back to that tragedy was really frustrating to watch
Next haney after cambosos García no good maybe teofimo but pitbull Cruz is the Best opnent there the moment
Fr fr Jim shouldn't have referenced anything about anything 😒
Classic Jim Grey. I seriously don’t understand why athletes even talk to him.
When your at the top you have to be careful what you say, WE ALL KNOW what Tank meant BUT if you want to be truly successful and a superstar is comes with the territory.
Jim gray k.o tank with his smart ass comment  cant see some one shinning without being a hater in the way
Felt like they tried to make a sound bite! Not knowing if he resigning to tbe or pbc. Had me hot.
Tank dog is the next great fighter up🥊🥊
It had nothing to do with guns it was an evil PERSON that did that shooting. SO TANK TALK ABOUT GUNS ALL YOU WANT BRO
https://youtu.be/_oUgPGCYnmk
https://youtu.be/_oUgPGCYnmk
https://youtu.be/_oUgPGCYnmk
Some people in America make me very confused. This guy brought up the recent shooting tragedies completely out of context with the conversation. Everyone knew Tank was not talking about that. But people like this guy are the first to defend your "right to bare arms" and at the same time "but you can't talk about a tragedy when it happens". Maybe as an American that might make sense to you. As an outsider looking in it sounds weird af .
Davis stayed humble after the win
Look y'all all of the pronouncers as we called them in the 60's are some of the most RACIST mf'ers ain't that right larry merchant, jim lamphead and list goes on and on. This the US don't expect nothing but
Teddy Atlas I'm sure is going to say about Tank what he says about every fighter: Tank beat a nobody
This guy a boxer
....stay away from guns?  We have a right to bear arms my guy, foh.
"NO Safety on this GLOCK!"  Tank!
Plz get grey outta there he's living in the wrong time.  He's always so cringe
We just saw the blueprint to beat Canelo.
Umm yeah he did. You really think he’s not gonna try to win ? Btw the only God they give thanks to us satan not Jesus Christ
Tank you’re a pure killah 🥊 Jim Gray you’re an idiot Rollie you’re not a bad fighter at all just not ready for Tank
Tank should've hit him with a uppercut for that gun comment.
Thank God 🙏 he is good
It would have been funny asf if he said ain’t no safety on this ar 15 lmaoo he said it twice too
"let's keep it away from guns, it's a horrible time in this nation" what?!!! Shut up and just move on..you wanna sit some ugly image like that In a MF head as he's..maaan I swear they just been so shiesty for so long it seem normal to us but these mfers be doin slick shit
Rolly's antics put butts in those seats and sold ppv so everyone should think Rolly for that.
Didn't like the part when he said we got blocks and they fully loaded after the situation that just happened with young children in Texas
Tank fought a smart fight. Get Rolly in the later rounds. Rolly is to dumb to keep his focus all the rounds. Dumb fighters will eventually make a mistake. Tank is on a higher level.
I expected more from tank it was an even fight until the knockout.
I don't know where he gets off telling him what to say. It seems like he's in the wrong profession.
Man u a beast tank
fixed!
His growth & maturity is astounding. Hope he keeps it up.
The exact same left Mayweather hit Hatton with
100 DAVIS IS A BEAST  MUCH LOVE AND RESPECT
Tank lying through his teeth. Anybody that throws a punch with sound effect. Is trying to take your head off 🤣🤣🤣
Gervonta Davis is definitely making moves and making good roles. God bless him the family, friends. Take care big homie. Peace. 1. 1.
My god I love watching this dude fight but I’m not going back to Barclays ever again.. It was super ghetto, weed smoke everywhere, I pulled out a tobacco vape and the usher came up to me about it smh meanwhile everyone was in there smoking dirty blunts. Not even real boxing fans they just came there act stupid. I’m from New York but New York people can hold this L from the way they acted last night. Soon nobody’s going to bring big fights like this to our city because of how ignorant people act.
WHERE IS PITBULL ?   .... DON'T RUN SIR!!  WE NEED TO SEE THE SECOND FIGHT.
How are you going to tell a grown man what to say? He said anyone can get it. Tank doesn’t have the responsibility to be PC this is boxing. Jim Grey shut your goofy azz up and just ask questions that matter. His “Glock” has no safety he’s  been around boxing enough to know what he meant….   I’ll say R.I.P to all those young innocent lives lost in Texas and everyday to senseless killings and violence. Protect the future. 🙏🏾
He talk like ali man. And humble at the same time
He is just a TANK, on the arena! 🥊🥊Congratilations Champion
...stop trying to tell him how to talk. u r interviewing [him].
Tank is straight up savage " Ain't no safety on this  glock and I got a lot of ammunition" 😂💯🔥
We dont have to make everything dark when someone mentions a gun now.. he made it sound bad my mind wasn't even on that... Great fight by Tank tho 👏👏👏
He didn't have to throw hard. Rolly's momentum going forward helped that hook to floor him. 💪🏾💪🏾

I’m from buffalo, live near where that terrorist came and traumatized this city, know people who lost a loved one.. what tank said wasn’t disrespectful nor distasteful! Dude is weird trying to check tank in that situation when it had only to do with boxing
I’d a told him gray stfu. Did they stop making or selling guns ? Alright then.
Ain't no safety upon this glock baby😂😂
He's a true warrior  Hope he surpasses Floyd..
Tank should give Cruz a rematch and avoid the running on the ring as well.
The world knew the winner before the fight come on tank is the best at what he do powers still a rookie
Bro Jim taking that low blow was weak AF.
Well, let’s all look at the bright side. All the attention is on the senior citizen. We all know what he meant by that statement. But I can see had nothing been brought up the media would have done their best to torch Davis.
I respect tank so much even in victory he decided to remain humble
I keep telling you casuals, you can't go from fighting class C fighters to fighting a class A fighter.
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life
Ain’t no safety on this Glock nigga !!!
Time to challenge elite fights here on out for tank Davis we all Hope Shakur Stevenson says he wants tank Davis what do y'all think about that?
😎
That was my favorite Tank interview. When he is humble he turns into a very personal friendly guy who you will root for.    That’s the tank I like and hope we get from here on out inside and especially outside the ring.
Boxing vs. Mma,see the science, not the savagery. BRAINS OVER BEAST.TAMED!!
Nah he threw all his power into that 🤦🏽‍♂️😂🤣🤣nigga gotta stop Cappin makes him look bad
That wasn’t even his power that was precision. Boxing is beautiful!
If it were Broner he would've said. Bitch don't tell me what not to say.
Esau trip me out with saying the stuff they say and they the man people killing shit racism,slavery and the massacres that happen be mainly them smh
Nothing better than true humble swordsmanship and that is what Tank showed.👊👊👊
Wtf Jim Gray? Can't mention guns? Is he allowed to call himself Tank anymore because of the war in Ukraine? Gtfoh!!!!
i would have like to see the judge give romero another round or even 30 seconds more to fight and finish it fo sure.
Tank is pro 2A Gray gtfo
It was a metaphor  got dang people tryna take away free speech smh let em enjoy the win. Tank all day!
💯😇🌺⚘🌴⚜🧭💗💜🌻💐🌼🙌🪴👽🔥🔥🔥🧿💞💞🧭🧭🧭👏🧞‍♀️🌷🌷🌷🌹🥀🥀
Talking about guns
GOD CREATED US TO LOVE US AND EVEN THOUGH WE SINNED AGAINST HIM HE DID NOT ABANDON US,BUT MADE A WAY FOR US TO BE RESTORED TO HIM THROUGH HIS SON JESUS;WHO DIED IN OUR PLACE AND IS RISEN...TRUTH.PRAYING IS TRUSTING THAT GOD HEARS YOU WHEN YOU SPEAK TO HIM AND MEANING WHAT YOU SAY...LETS PRAY,LORD JESUS I BELIEVE AND WELCOME YOU INTO MY LIFE,AMEN.*READ AND SPEND SPEND TIME WITH GOD DAILY,PUT YOUR TRUST IN HIM*ASK GOD TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HIS WORD*ALLOW THE HOLYGHOST TO LEAD YOU...I LOVE YOU BUT GOD THE TRINITY LOVES YOU UNCONDITIONALLY.
Jim Gray a weirdo for that comment. Everyone knew what he meant and he tried to make it mean differently.
Davis is such a humble fighter now. He's p4p one of the best
that was pacquiao's signature move
Making Baltimore Proud💪
It is time for Gervonta to give Cruz, the Mexican, a rematch.
This fucking guy should not interview nobody ever again it was unnecessary for him to tell Gervonta let's stay away from guns he shoulda kept his fucking mouth shut and let the athlete say what he feels that's the problem with this interviewers just like that did to Floyd
Dam tank should some really good sportsmanship and might be exactly what we all need to see right about now.  Thanks and congrats big bro.
Fire Jim gray
@JakePaul show them who does-
"I'm the top dog" _ Gervonta Davis
Jim Gray really?  So cringe 😬
Rolly is a poor sport
Tank didint what to say after that comment lol 😂
Let's Go Champ🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
A humble Tank is gracious in victory as cowardly Rollie was in defeat
Thats bs cuz even coach calvin said rollie "hits hard as shit"
Don't use a gun metaphor the nation's reeling from a mass shooting 🤣🤣🤣 when is there not a mass shooting in the nation. Let me know  those eight days so I can speak freely.
Jim Gray stop with anti gun rhetoric. Tank mentioned it has a metaphor.
This Mexican a fan of tank ,I really like tanks very respectful.
Tank completely controlled the mental aspect of this match from promotion to KO
Tank exercised the 1st Amendment in reference to 2nd Amendment of our country and Jim Gray tried to guilt trip him personally! You can't have it both ways!!!  Congratulations to Tank! Sweet KO!
If you judge Tank by his looks you wouldn't know know humble he is lol. Props to his mom.
I love this dude! He’s incredibly humble. I appreciate him acknowledging Rolly’s power and thanking him and his team. He’s just all around a great athlete.   But when Tank said I ain’t even throw it that hard, I just threw it, I lost it.. and he’ll fight again in 90 days whaaaattt 🥴🤣🤣🤣
It was cringe. Wt#** are you saying?
Dudes veneers are so big you can't understand nothing he's saying. He needs to take some of his winnings and get those things cut down and installed correctly.
You did excellent thanking GOD first. This is Rox San Castro, Lightning fast Christopher Salinas wife. We admire you very much for your hard work and dedication. In the name of Yeshua aka Jesus Christ, may you be blessed with health wealth and prosperity, but most of all LOVE. Once again congratulations on your hard earned victory. You go champ well done.
ONE THING IS VERY CLEAR,  AND IT IS THAT ROLLY IS NOT AFRAID OF RESIVING PUNCHES AND ALWAYS STAYS FORWARD,  ROLLY HAS A HEART TO FIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RING AND NOT TO BE RUNNING THE RING,  AND WITH MORE EXPERIENCE IN BOXING HIS NAME IS GOING TO MAKE HISTORY IN THE WORLD OF BOXING,  DAVIS CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR LUCKY SHOT…🥊🥊🤕
Why was that Rolly guy even in that fight? Who has he beaten?
Interview was awful. Dudes a hater . Congrats tank. .
Now why in the hell would that announcer bring up real guns and the boxer was talking about boxing
Definitively support tank now. This man said thank God. Most people forget without him this ant possible. God above everything
I want tank to beat up  Teo the fake one
He was doing so good until he went to "aint no safety on this glock" gun talk and "lots of ammo" comments. Just really poor timing to talk like that. Cmon tank
Big champ good.
Damn Jim, way to go!…thanks for playing dumb like you ain’t know what he meant smh we all knew what he meant when he said what he said, I hate when people try to make a bigger issue out of nothing….much respect to Tank and congrats on another victory!  & My condolences to all the fallen brothers and sisters 🙏🏾
Congrats
Stay away from guns, figure of speak Bitch. Probably mad cause his dum ass betted on Rolly lol dum ass 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
His face says other wise, look at that bump on his forehead…..and on his right eye.
Tank is a good fighter, respect from the 🇬🇧 uk.
always racists or something. Jesus man liberals he wasn't saying crap about the shooting. good lord enough
Jim Gray is a Sucka MC  For that comment. It’s like the media never wants us to have a good time.   Always bringing up bad news!! That man is talking about his fists and skills.
Jim gray you brainwashed brain.  I was enjoying Tank respectful fun comments and then you had to go and talk like you own the moment.  Please don't do that again.  I believe in second chances but come on.
Loma vs Tank 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Rollover romero.
Jim Gray is a SWS. They always try and manipulate words in order to demonize black folks
Tank is maturing in front of our eyes 💯 even after the disrespect from Rolly, Tank gave his respect. Great fight .
People paid thousands of dollars to see one human being beat another human being to near death and you can’t say glock? Totally makes sense. I get it. You’re not gay if he does it to you.
Stay away from talking about guns but won't tell that to those lowlife politicians and gun makers, even though he wasn't talking about guns.
Ain’t no safety when it comes to Tank Davis
Why are people thanking god. He doesn’t exist!!!!
L interviewer
🤦‍♂️That comment on the gun thing never meant no harm till the white man want to talk about the shootings. What a loser
Tank is a very intelligent fighter,  Rolly low ring IQ was the reason why Tank set him up for that left hook.
What round?
Atleast rolly got more balls then Ryan gracia
He should fight whoever wins the Kambososv Haney fight.
Tank's maturity and self-awareness...is why he's a champ...well...and he skilled too haha.
Throw the whole interviewer away 😂
Showtime need to get some new younger interviewers because the old racist white dudes ain’t shit.
Tank should’ve cooked Jim like Floyd did Larry Smh 🤦🏾‍♂️
Jim Gray got shady ways
Growth and maturity! I'm all for it!
Yeh guns ain’t toys, may be in there videos,  stood corrected and moved on.
Hell yea tank definitely had mind control over that guy I said the same shit when I seen that fight wasn’t making past 7
I wouldn't do another interview with this guy.  He got political at a blood sport let's think about this. Showtime better checc him before they end up like HBO. Anything to put a cloud over our sunny days.
Sound like Tank got some media training overnight‼️
Why does Jim Gray have this job? He's an instigator that just asks annoying ass questions.
That’s the guy who hates mayweather always  throws shade the interviewer
Nice tank like the maturity and the young man you've become keep it up champ
Posible ba na maglaban si tank at magsayo?
Young man has alot of class. True Champ
Tank is a beast but by how he talks I’m sure he can’t read
Is really good fight
Tank has grown and matured a lot
All he said is stay away from guns. Relax tank  he got beat up pretty good too
Woahh, he was simply joking. Chill out reporter
Tank got a birth mark on his head
was neither a fan of these fighters but now im a fan of Tank. his personality and humbleness is good to see, and his intelligence as a fighter. respect to him.
Yeah screw that guy. I wish tank was older and more educated so he could school him
don't give a fuck what Jim Gray said, that was a SICK ass line by tank
He meant it figuratively as in himself 🤦🏾‍♀️
Jim gray is a fucking vibe kill
davis vs cruz 2   it needs a rematch . fun to watch sluggish battle
Didn't throw punch that hard..... Knew he'll run into it...... Down goes Frazier....Down goes Frazier...
I'm sorry but dude! Go to speech therapy! It's a tie between Tank and his opponent when they talk! Successful but can't sound stupid..
I've just just found out Jim Gray is a tool.
Tank wasn’t talking bout Guns he was talkin about BOXING   let’s straighten that out off bat
I wanna know who got that mouthpiece he threw.....
Who was telling tank to press forward.
It kinda sucked without mauro ranallo Commentating
When black fighters win, let them speak to black ppl after the fight. This old wet dog was disgusting. Man I wish integration was still in place. These ppl don’t quit with their disdain for us.
He fought a guy with 14 fights.....WTF...This is why MMA took over
The ring save his ass🤣😂🤣🤣
Loma vs Tank
Same position marquez tko money Pacquiao different Pacquiao sleeping 😴 Romero 🥴groggy
Romero gots a Glass 👓Jaw Tank good fight.
Tank said earlier I think Wednesday that Rolly is stupid & would run into something.
Respects to tank. He showed love to Gary Russell family, still gave love to Rolly for taking the fight. Guy is maturing in front of us. Y’all just want to paint a bad picture like he a bad guy. Nope. Levels
Why does showtime still bring Jim Gay on? The man constantly asks/ says the dumbest shit to legit every fighter he’s ever spoken to, I doubt you’d find one fighter that doesn’t hate speaking to this man post fight. Literally anyone of the fans in the comments would do a better job than that old 🤡
JIM GRAY IS A SENSITIVE PUNK!!! GREAT JOB TANK!!!!!
why u be ducking LOMA for yrs???i think now u are better then before much better when loma comes back why not man up and fight him...
I said it before King Davis was going to knock that kid out.My family was making bets on what round he was going to knock him out i said by the 8th my youngest son said 3 my oldest son said 6th then my wife agreed with my oldest son and said the 6th round and they was right.i said I was willing to bet the house
Baltimore💥🤛🏾🥊Salute Tank..
Davis ran all night, one hit wonder.
Old Shay Whitay was outta pocket trying to check a young Bull
Isaac cruz Out for blood ..
Does anybody remember when tank use to be real quite.
As a Mexican! Respect and love Tank!! True champ! Thats the kind Mexico ..needs!!😎
Jim Gray is a weirdo
Fuck Jim gray wtf kinda name is that anyway 😂. His momma should've named him Mike black or Frank White 😂 or Bobby brown or some shit 😂
🔥🔥🔥
Hay Jim if you going to run for office do that but don't bring ya stance on guns onto the ring unnecessary 💯
I agree it was a short kinda hook punch, not a straight full extension full power left hand! Otherwise he probably wouldn't have gotten up.
How you gone tell that man what to talk about. Swear they want them guns ASAP!! Arm up people! Arm up!
God dang ! Always gotta inject political crap . . Look up the meaning of the word sports . . People come to put everything aside and enjoy themselves away from it all . . The media is always expected to inject it back in at every possible turn
That was an unnecessary statement Jim gray..tank was nothing but positive
Really.......dude always tries taking the moment away from YOUNGINS
Rolly have a glass jaw!
That gun comment was unnecessary. Liberals always kill the vibe with their political pandering.
Tank I knew what you meant speaking from your words. Sorry you were misunderstood. Thank you also for the fight. What a show you put on. I can't wait to see you and Garcia fight. Looking forward to your future.
They need a young turnt interviewer this dude just killed the vibe with that gun comment wth
Good looking out on round 6 gevonte
Funny. I’m just clicking just to point out the same thing. Punch wasn’t that hard. Good KO tho
Action speak louder than words
I like Davis he don't do alot of talking...but when he put them gloves on "BEAST" Somebody getting knock the F out 🥊
Tank actually impressed me with his comments. I hope Rolly does get the experience and gets better and has a good boxing career.
Jim gray lane as hell you knew what he meant
Stop interviewing with this awful commentator
Hes right i seen tank hit harder
Young Mr Davis had rented space in rollies head from the push
It's just a metaphor!
i like this man, fuckin beast. head hunter in his eyes.
MY MAAAN CALLED HIM BIG TANK AT THE ENDDDD !!🤡😂
If he don’t fight Lomachenko next or very soon, I will lose all respect for him.  Stop ducking Loma and prove yourself, Tank.
Jim Gray never has a relationship with fighters. He just tries too hard to be all profound. That comment was very unnecessary and Gervonta didn’t intend to make that joke at all
Mini mike Tyson
I mean we all knew this was gonna happen
Rematch with Pitbull 🥺
The interviewer is lame for that gun comment. Stfu dude, theres nothing wrong with guns and you shouldn't be worried about snowflakes getting their feelings hurt.
“and Things Like That “
Ellerbe should back his snake ass up they tried to sabotage the boy remind me if Don King vybes for real
Tank tank tank tank
“We settled it in the ring like men “, that right there shows he has respect for hands not guns. Jim could have saved the gun violence statement
My man raw.. no front with the tank!
It's not the punches that you throw hard that knock em down, its the ones they don't see. Btw that old man definitely ruined the gun line for sure.....smfh. he's a boxer gtfoh. Congratulations on the W.
Tank pure class
JIM GRAY says, " Let's take a look right here at the end of this fight as you uncorked this big-time punch with that "STRAIGHT" left hand"... JIM, it was NOT a straight left hand, it was a LEFT HOOK.
That old man is an idiot by bringing dose shootings up
#STOPDABUMFIGHTS
Pound 4 Pound
Mind you his network been playing movies all weekend with gun play. Damn hypocrites
This kid,  Tank,  has renewed my interest in boxing.  I stopped following fights after more than sixty five years,  because of all of the clowns,   and the wannabe Ali's.  But Tank,  is a boxer,  a smart boxer.  And he is respectful,  and not mean spirited,  except for when he popped,  Romero,  upside the side of his jaw.   🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ain't no safety in dis glock
As good as this clown is I can never support someone that acts like he does. If it quacks like a duck....
Gun comment didn’t need to be addressed at all, buddy should have got a hook too
Tank said god first and I know he means it and That just make me like him more always put god first and have faith and that’s why he won overall
Loma will frustrate you 100%
It might be that time for Jim Gray to join Larry Merchant, You Knew What He Meant, Not Cool Bro!
Tank clearly meant no disrespect to the people lost in recent tragedy. Great win and humble words in victory. On to the next!!🥊
GERVONTA "TANK" DAVIS would KO RYAN GARCíA within 5 rounds.
God first he on the right path
he tried to rain on tank parade 😄
Jim gray know damn well what tank meant unnecessary comment killed his moment
White peoples always gotta make shit controversial on purpose so they make us look bad. You know wtf tank meant… idk why you had to do all that 🤦🏾‍♂️
Mayweather is worried.
It’s kinda crazy how people can still not respect a fighter after he or she wins. The man was the winner it doesn’t matter who people thinks he’s scared of. He won against Rolly and that’s what’s important. The commentator knew he didn’t mean a real gun with his comment. What was that all about? It was just so random about gun violence in the world. I mean let the man have his glory!  People all of a sudden wanna talk about gun violence when you let an 18yrold kid gain access to AR15s and body armor. Take your gun concerns to the capital and let tank enjoy his win. His comments show growth especially after the heat Rolly was trying to put out 😝.
How he gonna tell that man how to talk??? The furthest thing from his mind was a mass shooting.
Say what you want, Rolly was doing his thing. Up till the knock out, Rolly was winning IMO. Davis only landed 25 shots till the knockout.
Rolly is a Bum with a foul mouth !!! Tank barely hit him and he hit the canvas !!! Also,Jim gray is a weisel for going there !!!
This kid is a warrior🔥 Bring it  on 'manchenco' this kid will knock your head off ✅✍️👊🏼😎facts❗
No Mayweather promotion did the best boxing match in boxing history that was better than watching the Mayweather fight Ali fight Mike Tyson fight George Foreman fight holyfield fight tank made that boy run into a brick 🧱📺📺🧱🧱🧱
I love this Tank Davis, Great Boxer. Congratulations 🎊🍾🎉🎈 for beating Romero. 🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
That gun thing was soooo lame by the interviewer. screw u
Tank all day man! 101%
😂😂😂😂no safety on this glock
That refeere needs to get the hell out of the ring.
Damn Jim, you didn’t have to go there. That was totally unnecessary.
Yo this dude jim gray is a clown get the hell out of here with lets keep the gun talk shit bro he wasnt meaning anything like that i cant stand this guy
Tank is maturing into one class act. Congrats Champ
Bro wtf was that gun remark by Jim Gray. I understand a tragedy occurred but why rob the spotlight from tank ? He made him feel embarrassed🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
The fight should have continued. 20 seconds left to end round 6.
Is he the new mike tyson.
The Rolly fans 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The Little man who overcomes and beats all the odds  Congratulations Tank
Man listen I knew he was gone win on it when he weighted in and he tapped dude and he failed I said awww man he to light on his feet.
Jim Gray needs to be fired. He just blew it outta proportion!
This guy is all class
Jim gray should of just not say anything. But keep it boxing
That old man ruined a happy moment,  everyone was vibing til he mad it dark smh
Dude. Old White men just have to wierd.  That man aint thinking bout no real guns or thst event. Geesh.
sigue hablando miedo rollo callado te ves 👍🏻 mejor
It was so unprofessional when that commentator told Tank not to talk about guns let the man make his speech have some professionalism and keep your personal feelings out of it.
that reporter iffy
That’s Was Si Corny To Bring Up Recent Tragedy. Killed Tank Whole Vibe 🤦🏾‍♂️ Tank Is Maturing For Sure
this white dude! that was unnecessary gun shit comment . he just killed tank vibe
Again who has this guy fought no one, Cruz almost beat this guy is was incredibly close, Rolly stinks ,
Tank funny asf lol he said I hope he good. He be ready to fight again in 90 days. 😂😭
Career ended
Jim Gray was being very unprofessional towards the end.  When Tank said there is no safety on the glock why would Jim Gray bring up the tragedy thats going on now smh and plus when is it that Jim Gray fights  for BLM?  *IN ALL OF THE INTERVIEWS I HAVE NEVER SEEN JIM GRAY FIGHT FOR BLM OR ANYTHING BUT NOW HE WANTS TO TURN IT INTO SOMETHING SMFH*
On Second Thought:  Sounds like censorship, at its core. When we look at how the "gun" culture is part of America's psyche, it stands to reason why we may be opposed to anyone stifling our use of metaphors, as it relates to guns, however, with "mass shootings" occurring more frequently - we have to consider how this meme is being fed, and what needs to be done in order to prevent these horrific acts of violence.....
Yeah guns r guns u should have said the cops need to stop being on the job if there to scared to do the job
Cherry picking, no lomachenko,haney,kambosos,king ryan and lopez.
I call bs he threw that counter left from below his hip. He was 💣.  Js
someone get ellerbe outta there.
GERVONTA, :: THE PITBULL CRUZ COME FOR YOU,.!! BUUUUU,  BUUUU..!!!
Why do they do that? Mention something  so touchy at a celebration?? Sheesh. Like he had something to do with it.
As if we didn't know what was eventually going to happen . at least I sure did mamma said knock him out. Tanks a real good boxer no one trick pony tailings around here boy .
He didn't mean any harm with the metaphor. We glorify boxing which one could argue is a  dangerous sport long term on the brain, and he is offended by a gun metaphor?  Gtfoh! Guns exist. Get over it. Condemn the evil people that carry them, not a fighter excited about a victory. Be emotional can make you stupid.
That KO a bit closer to the center of the ring probably would have been worse for Rolly. He definitely would have went down just like Pacquiao. That was a well timed shot and trust he probably didn't put a lot in to that counter Rolly just ran in and got caught trying to throw a combination.
Yeah then the world 🌎 needs to stop calling him TANK .
@showtime…..we don’t pay to watch commentators. Just a thought
In this post fight and interview of davis, i realized how good, humbled and blessed he is..there is something in him why he is the real champion..much love and respect for both fighter especially to rolly romero..better luck and be patient to your next fight.lmao
Tank is stupid fast with them hands. When you get knocked out in a fight and it nothing else to talk about.
García don't stand a chance !
I would've said if you knew I was talking about boxing how could you compare.  See its people like you the reason why the world so ass backwards.  Then walked off
Jim was wrong for his comment.
Tank BEEN saying ain’t no safety on this glock. White liberals kill me with their misunderstanding of our culture and bleeding heart mentality at the wrong fuckin time!!! It’s tragic what happened and RIP to all those lost and prayers to those affected but this fight was a reprieve from all that which is what sports are supposed to be but leave it to old media propaganda machines to sneak shit in where it doesn’t belong that’s why nobody acknowledged it!!
Ill be honest . Rolly fought the way i never seen him before using the jab trying to find the distance finally rolly understood boxing i lil bit .Tank was runnig like a bixxx since round 1 . I did not expect that from rolly great fight 👏  until he got stopped ! Thats why the experience plays a big roll on this fights . Tank has fought many champions . But rolly hasn't.   Rolly was actually winning the fight when he got stop . Only if he would of hold on he would of win the fight ! Great performance by both fighters.  This is why there r odds on boxing guys . Tank was 100-10 favorite .... this fight will make rolly a better fighter ....
People gon learn. People who aren't big speakers are unstoppable.
Gun comment came outta nowhere....
Good job. Punk tank
U just had to ruin the man moment with that gun bar
Goobtube is fraudulent
LEGEND!!!
Stupid for the man to say to stay away from using gun terminology.  You shouldn’t be promoting boxing then because it’s brain trauma people who are really the issue and not so-called guns.  Mentally ill people are the business end….
Congrat's Davis love from♥️♥️♥️🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Jim I see why you so full of fuckery we all know what Tank meant But old w.p. always think their so smart than the average 🙄
Jim Gray Was Wrong He Knows What Tank Meant
Jim Gray is a fool showtime should fire him.
Taco mukbang and my first ghost experience in Kansas https://youtu.be/iPVpcpRJ60c
liberalism is a mental disorder,tank was just enjoying his moment and this democratic idiot had to go political just to please his master sleepy creepy Joe,sad.
that knockout reminds me of the Mayweather vs Hatton knockout
Tank is a True Professional
Taking care of business.Much respect 🙏🏻 🙏🏻
To many times after the fight these clowns 🤡 like Grey… Can honestly tell that the smile he has is just for the camera… Tired of that BS from these boxing politicians…
He can't take a punch 👊👊👊👊 the same thing he talked about happened too him timber
Floyd Mayweather you lost your money that's what you get for betting between tank
Tank is already having trouble putting sentences together, give him a couple more years and he will need a translater because he will be too punch drunk to even know what he is trying to say.
Congratulations the victory is yours stay anointed tank
Jim Grey Is a ken
For all of you who are mentioning the gun statement how about we stop normalizing and glorifying the use of weapons that cause so much harm... guns are dangerous and shouldn't be made to sound fun and casual or else these things continue to happen let's move forward by making guns and gun usage be not something casual.
Gervonta vs lomachenko very nice Fight 💪🏼🔥🥊
Maybe he should leave Mayweather promotion I've never seen him so happy
Whoever this dude is trying to always stir things up needs to go. Why not just concentrate on the fighting and stop with the trying to stir up hate between these blCk men.
Interviewer messing up the vibe at the end. You know he wouldn’t of done that with a fighter of a different race.
Wtf why the man's trynna make it political, so weird
He ran into it this is the most amazing interview ever
Boxing is rigged tank just let y'all know and no I'm not a rolly fan.
Them rolly fans feel real dumb
Uncalled for comment 💯💯💯
Tank showed there is not 1 chump he cant beat.
All those tough guys have really high voices. I guess the higher the voice the harder you can hit? just playing lol.
What a bitch move by Jim Gray.
Tank handle that gun comment well cause i would’ve been like man you know what i meant foh We’re not talking about school shootings We’re talking about me getting the victory
Jim Gray unnecessary for you to bring up the tragedy, classes idiotic move.
A guy wins a fight with one punch and he is marked up ?
Ilove him being a humble champion
Let’s stay away from mental illness, let’s keep the focus on blaming inanimate objects.
Sit down. LoL. I want high five. Maaaannnnnnnn! Mauh!
You may want to THINK Your Ice Man for the Ice you'll need for the bump on your head.
humble guy.. tank davis❤
Bruh that was unnecessary of him to basically change his words
I wanna see Ryan. 👀 Come on Dude! Thank Davis!
Omg fucken Vaginas. Let's not say guns
Tank sounds like he's in the early stage's of CTE. He's slurring his words.
The Battle of the IQ ..... Trash glad I didn't buy this..... Davis needs step up and fight real opponents
The gun comment is coming from a young kid who’s listen to Republicans whining over their second amendment rights…so don’t get mad at him for all he knows!!!!!
The jew cries as he strikes you. He ruined the interview correcting Tank's perfect analogy.
I love how everybody hype on tank beating up a bunch of Nobody's.  He has never even fought a top 10 fighter in his career
Wht dude tried to make tank look bad and mess up his image by saying that bs knowing damn well he was talking in terms of boxing smh stuff like this is why our ppl cant move forward and let go of past history because some way some how wht ppl always show their true colors and feelings toward us
No safety on this Glock
Time for Gray to go.
Jim Gray is hilarious
he talking about his hand ✋ its like a gun...wtf got to do with what's going on...he said anybody got get it my hand is safe for anybody and it's powerful, com ND get it urban dictionary is needed here ...hahha
Tank has matured so much
Tank has mutured so much I love it he a true champion 🏆  much more success to this young man.
Humble… that why he wins. And great ful!!! God first🙏❤️👌💪awesome. Felicidades
Tank showed real skill and discipline
tank good man
Davis vs cruz 2. Greatness
CONGRATS TANK NEXT UP😇😇😇😇
Ain't no safety on this glock! He said what he said!
I knew Tank was going to knock him off his feet.
These analysis I ain't even gonna mention his name they pop shot and know they would never do that if the camera's wasn't rolling and man to King in a dark alley trying to get likes and a reaction salute King for not falling for it we didn't bring guns here u other color people did
AMEN!!PRAISE GOD!!#1FAN4LIFE,,BBLESSED,,
Lets stay away from gun talk?? We need new commentators. That was a pussy thing to do to tank when everyone knew dam well a school shooting had nothing to do with tanks comment..
Looks like a little doll. A little gay doll.
Tank is both a gentleman and a scholar in his own right. Above all, a champion. Great for the sport of boxing.
New York is with you!! Continue achieving Greatness!!!
White folks 4ya. Sad but true.
Can we stop.
He's metaphorically speaking... He was only talking about the power in his hands.
Stay away from guns??? Tell that to the NRA you damn GOOFY😡
Tank is maturing right b4 our eyes truly humble and special type of generational talent
I hope Garcia signs up to get punished
Thats was just dum  by Jim gray  need to get rid of him
Now Jim Gray that wasn’t 🅿️…
Jim Gray was right to clarify, and Tank was classy to offer his condolences. I didn't see anything wrong.
The Champ!
That was a great left. But didn't help Rolly walked right into it
Jim Gary a hating ass white boy
Honestly what Tank said was very true,becoz the way his position was at that very time he got Rolly was infact awkward puch without much power,but the louch speaking got dismantle,say Rolly got Swift off by Tank inspite of his all tras talking,be humble Rolly,Romario etc before you talk too much.
Tank is humble....my dude💪
He gave honor to GOD, I’m not surprised that GOD is with Tank. I’m asking GOD to stay with you and your family Tank. Your a great man Tank ❤️
He’s talking allot more and better
Tank from tha hood too,loadin up that Tank Turret lol #RobinHoodloomReel
Jim zGray needed to keep quiet..He understood Tanks. Glock comment.
that's so uncalled for by the interviewer. you try to make gervonta davis look bad on live tv. ik what we going thru rn is wild rn, but that was unwarranted. he made a joke and he wanted to turn it into controversy. smh
Aaaannnndddd ....Rolly reverts to his uncontrolled open and undefended lunge in as from previous fights, but this time gets countered and blasted out by an elite fighter. I hope he learns from this mistake and is able to refine his around boxing skills, he's young enough but just lacking the experience....this is a good, eatly wake up call from him and can help him become a much more accomplished boxer
Pitbull.   Rematch
He always trying trying to find a way discredit every black fighter victory hoe ass!!!
That gun comment was why out of pocket. Journalist should think better
I like when fighters get humbled! Tank is the best I hope Ryan signs the fight and he gets it next. I go with tank!
I love this kid,South African love boy🇿🇦🫂🔥💖
it was a super fight and a super knockout!!! Floyd Mayweather trained him perfectly
Guess tank didn’t hear about those kids .
That gun comment ruined the whole thing  Some white folk don't know when to stfu fr
C’mon man he knew what Tank meant by his Glock comment, that was very unnecessary.
That comment about the Glock was innocent and unintentional. You can’t tell another man want not to say. He’s lucky Tank didn’t tell him to shut up.
Like I said, Rollie isn't experienced enough for to beat Tank.!😆🤣
Just by thanking God, Gavonta Davis is a great champ because he recognized that without God he is nothing. Thank you CHAMP! GOD BLESS YOU IN ALL YOUR LIFE!
Talk about bringing down someone in their moment....they need to fire dumb ass Jim Grey. He looks really weathered!
Congrats TANK💯👑 GTD!!!!!!!!
Jim tripping. Everyone obviously knew tank was referring to boxing , nothing more. Why ruin his moment?
that was a bullshit statement by jim American been having shootings for years and when someone mentioned hands as guns no one said anything
The announcer made it more awkward about the gun reference, when tank said it I wasn’t even thinking about the shooting
Man 3:55 Jim needs to shut up and not inject his opinion into an interview.
I love tank Davis now he's a humble guy .. one of the best in sports of boxing ..  like Manny Pacquiao always humble to his opponents ..
He barely touched him with that shot!! Lmfao!!!
2:38 Rolly shouldn't even have thrown that weak ahh jab after the body hook😂😂it don't even look like a punch and his squared off
Jim is a weirdo, showtime needs a fresh face for these post fight interviews
Rolly had his eyes closed throwing punches ,and got caught .
Never get overconfident facing an opponent playing on backfoot. Romero had pathetic strategy, GD trapped him with his patience, and experience. Great fight🙏🏼👍🙏🏼
Rolly took the chin test and failed!
The whiteness in Jim Gray definitely showed with that gun comment. No sense of humor, no way of connecting that he was referring to his arms (punches) as the Glock, no flavor at all. I actually like Jim Gray though, he is a down to earth guy
It be comments like that from white people that be so insulting and foolish that have black people judging there whole race.
After this fight i know tank gonna knock ryan garcia the fck out
great fight. romero will come back stronger.
They need to get that fuckin interviewer outta there. Ridiculous trying to tell the fighters what or what not to say. !
Jim Gary STUPID for that ! Unnecessary comment .. Fire Him Plz
em video tôi thấy có mấy cái mẹo mấy video trước có rồi
WHY WOULD JIM GRAY mention the shooting when clearly he knew what Tank Davis Met by that comment???🤦🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️ WEIRDOOO!!!
Jim Gray just showed he is not in tune with the language of the generation, he needs to limit his interviews.   She how he misunderstood Gervonta comment... Time to GO!
Tank is that dude! Soo proud of you brother, keep moving the culture forward. He punches like Gerald McClellan. (Night-Night, 😴 )
Tank a misunderstood young Goat
People be mad they have to come back to the real world after the match is over. Jim Gray literally acknowledged Gervonta was referring to boxing w the gun comments. I mean the massacre did just happen soooo
Tank will now run and get more retro  Jordan’s🤷‍♂️
Let Tank talk. Jim is the one who made the connection between the comment and the school shooting. The viewers knew what he meant and most weren't even taking it down that path.
Hey man I get it's a sad time but don't be sensoring a happy moment with some negative bs that's where I draw the line personally let that man speak freely he just won exactly how he planned it he was not thinking about dead people like I get it , it's tragic af and i feel for them children and families but this is boxing not CNN and what he said had zero to do with actual death thought this was America 👀
Why do they still use Jim as an interviewer in boxing???
Boxing is something ! Unless you enter the ring . All the 2 boxers were talking  a lot . But in the end  Davies won by KO.
Come on Jim Grey quit trying to be a anti gun zealot, that was the furthest thing from tank's statement if you want to say what a scumbag evil S.O.B. the shooter scumbag coward was fine but as far as this American is concerned I'm not going to let these anti- American dictate what I can or cannot say, this nation was built on the 2nd amendment!
Like Tank said he was not warmed up at first around the third of fourth You could tell Tank was a different fighter !!!  Way to go Tank !!
THE BIG TANK IS  BACK.
Tank a monsta! Always delivers This kid is awesome
This man has been so lucky...with privilege...it was soo obvious that the referee was on the side of this man....give the rematch to pitbull ...but it seems that you are afraid of the pitbull to knock you out...my last comment...referee you are bulshit...thats why i prefer to watch UFC cause they ate real....
You need to cancel that reporter that's his slogan
dude already showing signs of brain damage
I want the second fight with pitbull.
tanks ganster startled the Caucasian reporter 🤣🤣theres no safety on this glock and i got alot of ammunition
this right sounded boring 😂😂
yeahaha wtf, tanks comment had nothing to do with anything other than his hands🤦‍♂️🥊🫠
Let's goooooo !!!! Get you some Mayweather if you bad take a real fighter in his prime 👀
“AINT NO SAFETY ON THIS GLOCK!!” “Lets stay away from the guns..” mannnn stfu let him has his time he was just using a term…. RIP and condolences to everyone involved in that shooting
You say glock and people get sensitive...shit we not the ones shooting up schools.....
Tank, shave of that excuse of a beard
Jim Gray.... c'mon man...you knew what he meant by that analogy...CLOWN
Tank should’ve said “people kil people not guns. Celebrities and important figures get protected by people with guns, why cant we protect our children the same way?”
I mean blind counter punches don't need to be thrown hard it just need to land on the sweet spot and another thing glocks actually have no safety button i see what tank did there.. good on young champ!
Slow
Credit to Rolly stepping up to fight TANK even though he knew deep in his heart TANK would eventually dispatch him. Who can beat TANK? Not really sure anyone can…
Very unprofessional by Jim gray like dude you knew what tank was talking about don’t do that smh 🤦🏽‍♂️
"and he the one ran into some talking about me!" and he would of fall on his face if the rope wasn't there he ain't maken it know better 😂😂😂😂I can't stop laughing!!!
Fake fight, fake ko. Boring, predictable outcome. Two c-level non-athletes scared to engage. The ending looked rehearsed. Rolly looked fine.
Good training skills, automatic punch of a good fighter, muscle memory threw that punch. Congratulations on your win, Rolly is an awesome fighter 🙏..
Seriously absolutely nothing wrong with his comment I thought it was funny... let's get one thing straight we don't have an issue with guns we have an issue with unstable people getting there hands on them in which they will always do so let's not take away the guns the good people need to protect themselves from the unstable
I'm glad the little brother won and knocked Rolly square on his ass.  Jim Gray was talking crap, he knew good and well what Tank's analogy was all about.
TANK -Aint no safety on this Glock & I got alot of ammunition  let's let's stay away from guns right now lmfao😅🤣🤣🤣🤣
Always some white man fear man talking about guns. You know exactly what he meant. Come on!!! You just killed that epic moment..
He knew what tank meant by the “Glock” comment. He just wanted to follow “the script” and pretend to care about the recent mass shootings and use Tank platform to say something about it. People are fake af.
Jim Gray is a racist bully. How has boxing not gotten rid of this hack already?
He didn’t mean anything by it… He set him up completely
NICE TEETH!
Did you seen the look on Rolly face when he got hit!!! Lmao 😅😅😅😅😆😂
That was exactly how Pacquaio got knocked out by Marquez.  Blind hook, didn't even see it coming
pacquiao hatton punch knock out brrrr
Love ya growth Tank 💯
I no bro just like Floyd… can’t read
I say that when tank pushed Rollie off the stage he was getting in his head
Dude meant no harm
I'd like to thank God and all that stuff.
That’s a fuckn market slogan right there  This GLOCK has no safety  Hahaha TANK as always a pleasure to watch and fight
He set him up like Money did Hatton, very similar styles. Tank is very good and that’s why I had him winning this, that left is a killer.
Congrats Tank, Class
I hate Jim Gray
Jim Gray is trash. I hate he tries to always keep the drama. Tank just gave Rolly props.
He isn’t the brightest boxer out the GROUP💯   Godbless u tank   U have skills indeed 🙏🏼
Tank is real.
Jim grey should not have said that, obviously he was meaning about his hands 🤦🤦
Tank is on another level.
Funny how  the commentator want to use that moment to correct him on gun comment but when they talk gun control they have nothing to say.   Tank should have called him out on that
Jim Gray needs to be released. Just interview and shut up. No one was even thinking about that depressing stuff until he brought it up.
Jim gray just lost he’s job
Great Davis but.... Is necesary Pitbull Cruz vs Davis 2 in the Best level.
This guy does not like blacks lol
It was a low blow about the guns 💪, but it also reminded him to talk about the Russell family so sometimes things get said it happen for a reason, still not cool
Jim gray is a 🤡👈👈👈👈👈 He should've been 1 of those Students that got🔫🔫🔫🔫 He ask ?'s with 🚫Common Sense
He's a humble young man,
Thank you for put God first have been waiting for this no more talking bruh💯🔥
glad to see some one thank God first.
Jim Gray trying to censor Davis.   Who does he think he is?   He should be fired.
The interviewer is always saying dumb shit and or trying to get the fighter mad.  Why does he still work for showtime?
You understand metaphors Jim. How lame of you. Especially because Tank was being so humble the entire interview! Much respect to Tank. Jim... I've loss a little respect for.
rolly was dominating though. one wild rush in and it was over
Jim Gray’s bitch ass bringing gun politics into the sport was unprofessional.  We already know gun control will be one of the topics of this next election. Gtfoh with that!
Congratulations to tanke Ryan next tank 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Tanque es un Tanque bendiciones Para El Tanque Davis 👑💯🇨🇱🙏🇨🇺✌
Best I’ve seen tank talk…
He’s to young to have slurred speech like that.
Keep it moving rollie tank uou da shit bro congrats
Fire Marshal Bill didn’t have to kill Tank vibe with that comment. Don’t bring politics to the fight .. idiot 👎🏿
Rolly rolly rolly got a dab of ranch😂😂😂😂😂😂
F what that old man talking about I love guns ! 😍😍
He’ll be able to fight again in 90 days 😂😂😂😂
Tank is mad relieved. He was losing the fight
Wtf??? Yo, bigups to tank to show the world how mature he has gotten. Give tank his props and efff this dude with his questions and dumb statements.
Jim Gray L
Really dnt c no one beating him and I support Garcia heavy but idk
Bro there was no need to bring up the tragedy that’s going on after Tank made that funny dope comment CLEARLY he was referring to boxing your weird ass turned it into something else, glad the crowd didn’t boo and understood
So damn I guess we can’t even talk about guns no more? Smh
Classy way to end it tank 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾🍾🍾
Jim Gray has been doing this for 40 years. He knew that if he didn't remind Tank about the gun crime in Texas, old media would crucify him.  Jim Gray did Tank a solid.
People need to understand timing beats everything and tanks timing is on a different level !!!
Keep the gun talk down it's a hard time in our nation. Gtfo. America is soft af. Ukrainian kids are literally getting blown up on the daily basis and we are having a tough time. Gtfo
Him needs to calm down and get HIS emotions in check that was unprofessional
Jim Gray wack ass didn't even have to say that! This man just got finished putting a MF to sleep. Let tank live!!
I know this wasn’t going to go far. I went as far and predicted a KO in the first round 😂
Don’t like this fella,shame the gay kid didn’t win
Gervonta super humble tbh respect innocent boy
Rolly 🥺🙄🫣🥹😁😄😃!!!! Pitbull Cruz rematch vs tank
Pure mathematical genius boxing by Tank. Great fight.
Did he mention pacquiao
The victims are the heros now welcome to 2022
Jim Gray need to watch Paid In Full 😂
Knew rolly would get flattened ref should of let it go on for bit i.m.o he beat the count but rolly need lot of improving
Much respect to the guy interviewing tank at the end if the fight for redirecting that gun comment tank said cause something that ment to be used in a different meaning could of be taken out of context...
I hate to see it but……If he was a white man and compared himself to a gun Jim gray would’ve just laughed it up with him😒……..lets normalize black responsible gun owners💪🏾…..Also we need some new blood in there interviewing fighters 👋🏾 Jim gray old as hell
Fire that goofball announcer
Homeboy tank is humble af I like that 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Ima be honest dis kid is great mayweather teaching dat cat how to be great he gone be legend one day
Idk y it was so funny to me when tank said "he will be able to fight again in 90 days" 🤣🤣🤣
Who you want next.. "I'm here baby" true champ talk!
Ruined the whole interview, he was the only person in the arena thinking about that when he said it. Tank ment no disrespect obviously it was a metaphor for him haven plenty of gas left in the tank. Guy should be fired.
Rollie inexperience walked into it.  Notice Bivol did not run in to Canelo on the ropes even when invited in.
Gervonta vs ryan garcia would be sick i honestly dont know who wins that fight. I do know im in favor of Davis though.
isaac cruz rematch
White man always trying to mess up a young successful black man’s moment smh.
Jim gray could have kept that he fake too
This is the Real Reason Salvador Ramos Killed Elementary Kids!!! https://youtu.be/RT9L-U8jFoE
Here we go forcing pc talk on black people again…
Gervonta is a a class fighter pure respect.. all the best tank
Why  don't you give Cruz rematch
Great fight bad comment but tank is still a bad dude that I see going 50-0 as well
what a cheap shot from Jim Gray smh...
@showtime Fire Jim Gray!
He said noooooo he ran into the punches 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆
Jim Gray is the worst
Davis vs ryan garcia
Can we get a Hispanic or something else interviewing fighters at the end
Why tf would he bring that situation uppp , to make tank look bad , he knew tank wasn’t thinking anything of that situation smh🤦🏾‍♂️
Tank looked uncomfortable through most of the fight. That left was very comfortable.
They all was betting against  TANK,  they got a big  surprise.
SIT Mayweather in the 10 Row During your Fights. .👉 Major  Distraction.::   B-morr ON Point.THO
"tank" you for knocking the fuck out of that bullshit
Rip Gary Russell such a great man
Don’t let him interview people no more .
He was doing great in that interview until, he started talking stupid. Why does everyone try to be gangsta? So freaking stupid. That's why these idiots keep killing themselves on the daily. That's why people don't trust you. Muhammad Ali would have shook his head at this dummy. Let's be better people.
Just another can for Tank to crush.
It was a perfectly landed hit. All to it
Que pésima defensa ...!
tank has grown mentally  especially when rolly was mad cocky coming into the fight i love how he took the win with such humility. Big ups to tank #aintnosafetyonthisglock
If the announcers knew what he ment behind the glock comment make it something that it wasn't he most definitely changed the vibe after that
Tank sounds like Mike Tyson!
he's ready for everyone but not for a rematch with the pitbull...lol
Tank celebrated like if he had just defeated the top boxer in his class. Romero was a no name boxer.
Circus clown Commentators.::🤜🥵 Every Ghetto in America is a Killing field.  Congratulations TANK. .Professional  should Never speak to  commentators 🇺🇸 Cockroach media ::
Lucky shot !!
tank is my favorite fighter and he has come a long way very humble
Jim Gray lost all respect from me with that stupid comment! He knew good and well Tank wasn't talking about that. We watch sports to get away from all that!
that old white dude was outta pocket for that tragedey comment.
He barely Even hit him. Rolly Mustve just wanted a check. Cause he didn't even do much. Boring fight. BTW, why would Jim bring up that Texas situation? He knew G didn't mean anything by that comment. Why force that bs on the crowd when they already been hearing about it, 24/7, via the media
What a liberal douchebag putting Tank on the spot with that comment. Kudos to Tank for being so humble
That knot on his head looks like it’s just another tattoo 😂
Fuc dat u can say dat it wasn't bout da kidz u should have said tell da republican 2 hold dat vote and say yes but anyway try 2 make da Blackman look bad
It’s wild how athletes get held to a higher standard than the Senators and Congressman that can actually do 💩!
Tank is a class act, props to him 👏
“AINT NO SAFTEY ON THIS GLOCK” … that’s tanks quote after every fight 🫤🫤🫤 you telling him about the school shooting but not the 13 black people killed my guy 🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥💯💯
Felicidades para éso gerero
This dude tank has matured props to tank true champion👍🏾
He honestly didn’t I didn’t watch the fight but saw where he clipped him and he didn’t throw hard his hand was at the right place at the right time other guy walked right into that punch lol
im rooting this guy since he beat pitbull.and he didnt disappoint me.
well pacquiao situasion was different, marquez was hart badly so pac just was recless
Gervonta got my respect! Great great young man! God bless!
Jim gray needs to get fired up on his tweeter for that gun comment
Tank,was so excited,he wasn't thinking about gun issues,, what an outstanding Performance 👌 by Davis,, he's best was yet to come,, Romero had never been a that situation,, question is can Romero take a solid shot,,,Rolly lack of experience in big fights,,was trying to land one big punch,, didn't happen,,,bad sportsmanship by Romero,, terrible, horrible, sportsmanship,,,,,needs more knowledge of Boxing,,,fight was good for boxing,,,fans were excited and on there feet standing,,,, lot's of tension and hype over the fight,,, Explosive,,,,
Rematch Gervonta? 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️
Fight the best in other division if you want to be the best in boxing.
That great value Bob Barker with the shits💩 trying to twist Tank words like a crossword, bruh you knew what tank meant what do you prefer mf I throw down thou gauntlet for all challengers 🌹
He's literally got 1 braincell in his head.  He's so dumb.
Wow 😮 so no one in the comments believes Tank could’ve used a better choice of words considering what just happened
This boy supadupa shlow lol he needta chill now go on head and relax ya life now mane get that mental right
Kalau berani tantang ryan garcya
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💪🏾🙏🏽
he speak like irom mike tyson
Jim Gray is a typical hypocrite. This fight and Tank’s comment had nothing to do with gun violence. And everyone knew it.
WTF would you meant that shit! That dude has absolute no class. But you checking Tank check your local politicians cause they ain't trying to pass laws for these situations. I wouldn't want him interview my post right fights no more . That was unprofessional and rude he knew what Tank meant cause he just said it but you meant it anyway old media is a joke!
Jim Gray, old man, people are dying everyday in America due to gun violence. Before the mass shooting with all the kids, we were averaging 1 Mass shooting a week & still are
Half the comments are bout the glock statememt in which peeps knows he meant his hands. Seriously these peeps come up out ot woodward
Confrats tank!!!!
I love The heart of   TANK DAVIS THAT'S YOUR INTERVIEW TANK WHAT  YOU SAID ABOUT YOUR GLOCK AND PLENTY of shells  He knew what you meant  but he just had to butt  fuck himself on live TV.  I think we all know what you mean. GUN VIOLENCE IN THE USA IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE A DEADLY ISSUE I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE MISS-USES THEM  FOR HATEFUL REASON. ITS A MENTAL ILLNESS OF THE SHOOTER. SO WITH BEEN SAID WHY HE DON'T TAKE HIS BROKEN HEARTED ASS TO THE People that don't want to do nothing about the gun control and tell them what to say and think.  ONE THING FOR SURE  HIS ASS WOULD HAVE BEEN PUT IN HIS PLACE IF THAT WAS MAYWEATHER WITH THAT STATEMENT.  ONE THING ABOUT FLOYD HE BE PUTTING THEM ANNOUNCES IN THERE PLACE WITH THAT DUMB SHIT.  RACISM AND GUNS IS WHAT THE USA WAS BUILT ON. IT'S THE TRUTH AND IT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE.  UNTIL MR JESUS CHRIST COME ON DOWN !!!!!! keep winning TANK love you little bro.
Nobody else was thinking about guns that way and this mf wanna go and steer the convo into that smh
Tank is slowly becomg your favourite fighter
When will Gervonta fight a Teofimo, a Devin Haney, a Ryan Garcia, a Lomachenko??? To be the best, you must beat the best.
Dude old ass could’ve kept that comment he knew tank wasn’t talking in that way
Savage! 💯
He should of mentioned then the 20 million+ people the US army and their weapons have extinguished. Like I said in 6 and it happened. Always choose skill over a big mouth. Rolly is in another class category, well below that of tank.
ROMERO,....BUAAAA,JA,JA,JA,JA,JA,...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Talo si mayweather sa pusta kay romero sya lumagay
Tank has matured,grown,and humbled himself alot,I like this guy much more now! Good win Champ! And for the old man interviewing him,he shouldn't do anymore interviews.Trying to spin what tank said into his Political Agenda,Tank was simply referring to his hands.Liberal creampuffs always spinning shit!
Media always trying to push that agenda , Tank he knew what you meant ,just like we did !  He's a Busta, guns are the victim as well,  Stop triggering this behavior evil doers !
What a humble dude!
Why is Gray even there he sucks and to old. Showtime needs a young blood
Matured! This is the guy boxing needs
Y'all gotta get these old white dudes off the mic. They are completely out of touch with this generation. The negative comment about guns was inappropriate and ruined the moment. Everybody know that's standard Tanks metaphor. We had a great moment and No one was even thinking about that awful shit.
now,  Romero does not have a face show to the world after he was knocked out, after all those boasting of knocking out Davis, before the fight.
Looks like a dive to me
People love this big drama show
Jim Gray is lame for the gun comment.  He clearly understood what Gervonta's reference meant.
They keep giving us fights no one wants to see.
Gervonta best of thé best now.
Jim gray didn’t hafto go there tanks said that before 🤦‍♂️
Mayweather did it again
Tank has become very mature fighter! I don't see him lose to anyone!
Rolly’s ankles were gone they left his ass in the ring … ankles said I’m outta here this dude got hit by a tank 🦶 🦶💨💨🤷🏻🥊
Tank is the GOAT 🐐 🙌 😎 🙏🏽..Always
12 hours later Rolly is still dazed from the left hook!
The boxing commission needs to require these fighters to have a least a High School Diploma. I miss the days where fighters sounded educated (or a least tried) and not used "uh, nowhatimsayin, nowhaimean," it's hurts my ears listening to these fighters talk.
I knew there was no way a nigga in a fur coat with no shirt in the summer was gonna beat Tank😂
Jim Gray extra for that comment. Idiot
Jim Gray is so full of it. He probably got the NRA on speed dial. Just stand there and hold the mic
still pitbull is better. i like tank but yea pitbull deserved the win.
'EVERYBODY GOT A PLAN .. TIL THEY GET HIT' - TANK DAVIS
Just as i predicted! On tbe 6th!!!  hahaha
Rolly got up saying don’t ever play with matches 😂
U did good.  God bless u.  Peace be with u
'EVERYBODY GOT A PLAN .. TIL THEY GET HIT' - TANK DAVIS
Did Rolly lose his belt? Lol
Thats like me lol I have real bad hearing in my right ear from boxing. Taking left hooks over the years.
if you know how to fight in general then you would know that a perfectly placed shot that your opponent isnt expecting doesnt require much force to knock them out - speed, precision and a defenseless target = sleep
I would of rather seen 2 chickens fight
Gervonta is a classy fighter I give him his congrats
Romero said bet my house, and I lost. How can I get it back. Any suggestions?
Rolly stepped into that left. Crazy how the cameramen zoomed in on Rolly in "twilight"
Teddy called it
Faaaaark your speech was going well until you mentioned guns n ammo faaark weak bro 🤦‍♂️🙄👎
Jim Gray is a peice of shxt and needs to learn to do his job and be neutral and nothing more. keeping his feelings about outside topics out of interviews. Goof .
Tank time is now he goin after every contender in the division now only up from here!! Wya Haney?
“And he the one that ran into something talkin’ bout me” 😂😂😂 Tank really my guy yo
No standing 8 count dude got knocked down got right back up rough should have never stopped the fight
The whole glock thing was extremely taken out of context by the Jim Gray. The fact that he brought that whole thing up was just weird; people like that are extremely dangerous and are threat to progress.
Come on , boxing fans need super fight , Ryan Garcia was there why he didn’t fight tank yet ?
I hate when ppl tell ppl what to talk about……. We all know what he ment with the Glock comment…… it wasn’t that serious 🤦🏽‍♂️
Thier where talking about Texas not russle
Your a true champ tank blessings bato
Hope he's gonna fight Loma!
"And things like that"
L interviewer
Dude gtfoh telling the champ on what he can say!
That boy has grown frfr
I didn’t really know much about Davis or Rolly but I like his attitude and humbleness in victory. Got a new fan right here…
I thank God FIRST…. Victory belongs to HIM , happy Sunday
Like i said!,like I said!..5 maybe 6 rounds if tank is done playing wit him! 😂🤣😭 fucking called it! I’m weak! 😂🤣😭
Tank has true power like Wilder but getting outboxed by an unknown sloppy fighter like Rolly is not a good sign. He needs to be technical if he wants to beat Lopez or Loma
Rolly will soon be forgotten into oblivion unless you change your ways. You insulted an opponent without grudges towards you in all manner of insults. Ok, let's agree you did it for PPV which you stated everyone should buy because you are KO'ing Tank in 1st round which you didn't achieve, you were KO'ed and I expect you to be a man and say sorry to the man for all your antics before the fight, but you went on still insulting and even lying about what we all saw was a clear beaten. I don't even know about you if not for Tank. Change your ways or the last time you get a fight will be a sparing with a lunatic like you. Your own father even said he preferred you when you were a kid because you don't talk and everyone thought you were deaf.
That gun comment from the guy asking the questions was a hoe move. He made something out of nothing and poured salt on a wound at the same time.. smh🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
IMO-Jim Gray may need to step down from the ringside interviews or focus purely on boxing. I don't wanna hear his opinions; I wanna hear good questions that put us in the fighters mind.
Tank Davis is so good and a cool ass dude
He said what he said “ain’t no safety on this glock”BITCH
Jim Gray needs to be fired for coming at the champ like that when he was talking about boxing 🥊 only in his metaphor about no safety on his Glock, just tasteless response from Jim Gray.I truly believe he doesn't appreciate African Americans
Now tank knows how we feel when side quest doesnt give that much xp!
ABSOLUTE RESPECT TO HIM FOR THANKING ROLLY AND WISHING HIM THE BEST A TRUE CHAMPION
Condolences to Uvalde, Texas
Tank seems like a good kid, great sportsmanship, respect to him for his win.
He grew so much....a great fighter, also you can tell that hes a good person.
If tank would've put everything in that punch rolly still be out
Ninja said stay away from guns wtf?
When Jim Grey Politicized Gervate's glock statement I was furious that he would try to spoil this great victory I will never listen to a Jim Grey interview again. When you look inside a ring after a fight anymore there are so many paid people who are looking to get there 15 minuets of fame off of someone elses hard work.
King Garcia 🔥
he is more like manny than floyd, personality wise
Tank don't even know his own strength  talking bout "I didn't hit him hard". Poor Rolly thought he was kicked by a horse.
GTD phenomenal post fight interview!!!
It’s not tank’s intentions it’s the impression that others may take saying my Glock is ready with a lot of ammunition think about it family We all know it’s the younger generation that’s doing the shooting And can be impressed by that comment, If you lost a child in the school shooting or a mom or dad in that buffalo shooting the last thing you want to hear someone saying my Glock  Is ready and I have a lot of emanation think about it family.
Tank didn’t mean any harm by his comment. And we all knew that. The Glock isn’t the problem the AR-15 is
same way floyd did hatton lol i bet 400 on tank ko rnd 5 or 6 thank you tank i’m like 40-1 on boxing bets only one i ever lost money on is broner vs mikey
What a shit fight
Nicca gotta speech impediment
I say this on every comment Romero looked like he was trying to put the clutch in with his foot then when he did get up he was like humm it's time to go to work what time is it like he just woke up and his dad was like come on miko its ok I told you to watch out for those black guys little fancy tricks
Guns dont kill people, people kill people. Buju banton
I believe what he said if he throw the right hand instead of his left hand
Jim "gun control" Gray
He could have rectified himself by sending some condolences to the families in tx.
Jim gray should cancelled. What kind of comment was that? Donkey of the day.
That was a pure class act on the part of Tank to foresake cockiness and acknowledge his opponent like that💯
Same punch that Marquez landed on paquiao
Garcia Loma Haney Kambosos Lopez and Tank have to fight eachother. Boxing always robs the fans of fights we want to see. I know Garcia wants tank in December but let’s see if that even happens
Ok ok 💪🏿💯
Thats right tank u spoke like a grown man
Jim Grey being extra.  Say that ammo reference to the NRA and the Gun toting, Gun Loving GOP Senators who refuse to pass sensible gun legislation.
Wow! Like pacman vs maquez punch!
B- Mores finest!!!🌹👑🔥💪🏿💯👍🏿
Guns ain’t the problem. It’s the people that make stupid decisions when they use them.
Jim’s post fight interviews aren’t that good anymore. I didn’t like his response to Tank about guns. Nothing against him personally but I’d like to see him replaced by somebody more knowledgeable about boxing.
Another win for Tank Davis which is mean's maybe another sales for Go Westminterteak ask for Jim Teambroeck or Freddie Fluchel they're both ready for you for you as a customer to have the magnificent refine furniture at it's best all you have to do is order: Thank you
R.I.P. Mr. Gary Russell Sr.
Romero very lausy not enough punching youre an amateure fight you did not punching just looking only not agressive he is challenger but he box one by one no not enough expreience.. only ryan garcia can KO davis
I love how he is aware that he is cocky , but didn't indulge. More of a champion than Floyd , that's for sure
I don’t like that reporter for real
"Aint no safety on this glock. I got a lot of ammunition"   - Malcom X
Dale la revancha a Pitbull Cruz!!  X un cinturón! Y de seguro c te borra esa sonrisa.
Jim is a complete weasel. If I was tanks coach I would have grabbed him and ended that interview. Idk why everyone wants to be a hero. Shut up Jim. What are you doing to help any type of situation? Unbelievable!
Hartford ct in the house lol
Bravo gervonta 🖤❤️ After rolly next ???🤔
Mayabang ka Kay pitbull nga talo kadapat Kasi duwag ka sa malakas nugok
Tank made him eat does words lol
All that talking and got knocked out 🥊🤣🤣🤣
That nigga not no boxer he left out the ring what kiknd boxer he is lausy as real talk show no respect take the l nigga you got knock out
Ref should have allowed the fight to continue. Rolly doesn't have to be in there with Tank. Ref should have allowed Him to learn that the right way
I won't be surprised if Garcia is gonna try to hype himself up and call Davis out on twitter like he want it so bad but... 🤣🤣
In real time you can tell he fucked his hand in the round before only threw that left the whole round and still used a bait tactic to put him out that's nothing but time spent in the ring vet tho GD has been in our eyes for so long he's still a young young Vet we forget that experience matter
いかつい
Totally uncalled for on the gun comment by Jim Gray.
Yea right, the replays from other angles prove otherwise.  The shot came across his body and landed perfectly lol.  It wasnt so much a straight punch at all and RR lunging in didnt help him at all lol
ARRIIIIIIIBAAAAAA CAMPEON LE DISTE AL BOCON
Overrated
Pitbull is waving... remember you lost to him.
Tank vs Ryan Garcia!!!
Is Jim Gray paid to be awkward and flagrant?? Could just be me but I feel like  they have that man doing the most by digging and asking the most ignorant questions in these post fight interviews and nobody is here for it. Definitely an L for sports in general.
We know tank didn’t mean anything by that Glock comment why he had to throw that in there smh…. And tanks not the law enforcement who sat there while those kids were being gunned down I can’t stand when people kill a vibe 🤨🤦🏾‍♂️
Just like Ricky Hatton talked a lot of ISH to Money May and got caught with a  CHECK HOOK 👊🏾👊🏾
Tank was very brilliant
Americans and Guns....
The only fight to make for tank is the winner of Haney vs kambosos
Thats the pacman punch
Nice to see a humble winner .God bless him
Fuck that, his glock ain’t got no safety 😂😂
That reporter is annoying he really didnt have to say that abkut the guns just ruined the whole mood u can tell that mf racist too. This coming from a white person
This guy Jimmy😡😡😡
It wasn't nothing wrong with tank glock comment I knew exactly what he meant futher more they were white people that did that shooting. Let's goooo champ no safety on that glock....... 💥💥💯💯💯💯💯💯
YT always goin to the extreme with stuff…you knew he didn’t mean nothing by that comment. Similar how they use to do Floyd
Darn neanderthal is his name jim gray or jim crow
Lol ain't no safety on this Glock! Hell yeah 😁
I can’t stand these commentators saying such stupid unnecessary things. The shooting wasn’t even on my mind in the least.
Gg vs davis
pride is the beginning of destruction 😈
Can’t do nothing but respect it
Jim gray trying to follow Larry merchant footprints stop biting !!!!
Romero he is a good fighter you challenged him keep it up 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Tank class act .. go tank ! Good fight!
Student of the game,very psychological,tremendous fighter iq
They need to stop using those garbage black exhibition canvases. Use the blue canvas because it looks much more official
Tank is gonna be 1 of the greats
Stupid reporter needs to Keep his stupid lefty woke Shiite to himself
I hate when these announcers give post fight interviews wit fighters  They always throw low blow jabs after the fighter wins especially black fighters
Ain't no safety on this Glock!
I’m ctfu he killed the vibe
Great fight. Btw How does Jim grey still have a job
What are those sideburns 😅😅😅
Tank's style of fighting is just beautiful, satisfying and terrific. He remains a bad fight for anybody at 135.
this is the next MAYWEATHER BUT he is better than him
The man was using an analogy and Jim Gray ruined it by making it political.
always feel like this interviewer is always trying to get black fighters to act a fool, even when they choose to be humble
Tank is extremely humble. I'm gonna be honest, I don't really root for him but I sure got Hella respect for him.  He's definitely growing on me. Now he needs to fight the best fighters in. Lomanchenko, Haney, Kambosas, Teo, pitbull again to solidify him being the best at the 130 - 140 weight classes
Rolly sold that fight he wasn’t that hurt smh
His name is Tank. Forget Glock 😆
I hope he don’t leave Floyd
0:10 this young black guy actually believes in God! He has the marking of the anti-Christ all over his body. Or maybe his God is not the Christian God
Yoo...tank said so he can fight in 90 days...nooooo chill!
The minority opinion is over represented in the comment section , it’s so far from what most normal people think … it’s funny!!!!
Tank shoulda caught old man w a hook
Pitbull Cruz 😁
Tank fighting with bum.🤣🤣
In the bag, who next?
Man that fight was boring 😴 , I'll never stay up to watch a Davis fight again.  Until he fights some real boxers and not scrubs , his skills are low level compared to the big hitters of 135
Jim Gray is truly Larry Merchant lite, always trying to check or scold a black fighter over some bullsh!t…
I think this will be the end Jim Gray post fight Interviews, he's too old anyways...
GET RID OF THAT ANNOUNCER‼️‼️‼️#IamTank
give me tank vs cambosas
So Rolly rolled over.
Bro the punch was so clean it didn't need any strength.
Gun references old fucker stop the gum is amerikkka's representative!
First time I've seen Davis bruised! Rolly's got to be good!
Lucky punch lol ,running scared
Davis .... 🦵🦵🦵🦵run run runing men
Totally unnecessary comment from the twat with the mic regarding guns
When he said he doesn’t want to say any names he was referring that to Ryan Garcia.  Ryan wants to fight tank for his next fight
'This glock got no saftey"  Tank Is Just Raw Got To Love It  🙌🏽🔥
Hell of a fighter but he have to prove himself against the top dogs!If not now then when?Next fight should be a big fight
They need to get rid of Jim asap that old white man needs To be fire even doing it slick shit for years
Rolly, pumped faked his ass, into an ass whopping
My man tank.. no haircut or fancy shorts straight warrior, the tank😀
Jim Gray you’re embarassing! Great KO by Tank!!
Tank is a beast from Baltimore  keep doing you 💪 💯 best winner 🏆 🥇  Keep representing Baltimore
Tank sounds very mature ! much respect to him and he know what tank was referring to regarding" gun" remark! stop it
It's not Tank fault these politicians let crazy people get AR 15
congrats tank Davis❤️🔥❤️ from 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Tank has matured over the years
Jim Gray has always historically been a weasel.
I think rollys the one that threw his power but his face into davis fist
"Just like Pacquiao vs hitman", yeah nearly the same..
I think Tank handled the interview excellent  His tone demeanor and delivery showed honesty, truthfulness, and even humility. He bypassed the question (as he should) of who he was fighting next with a metaphor.  The statement was a travesty from Jim as he knew the reference was related to boxing However, somebody somewhere could have easily seen Tanks words as offensive.. And yes this may have been a  moment to bring up such tribulation--when the world is watching so we can address our most valuable issues. Therefore, i think by making that statement, he gave Tank an opportunity to clarify his remarks, which Tank in turn showed compassion. Gun control, mental health, moral values are issues we must continually address. That's our worldly problems. Tank is a Glock without safety and lots of ammunition. Thats a big Problem. Currently I dont know whos gonna address that....
Mayweather/Patton like.
my future idol!
Still a bum gervonye gayvis
When Earl Spence be yelling strap season they don't hush him.woow. I'd cus his white ass out.
That thing on the gun shit,was weird af Jim Grey that was awkward and pointless to say
Tank is the GOAT in this Era! Rolly had a lot to say but,left the ring like a sore loser. I didn’t like the way the Guy doing the interview chose to highlight and blow the gun comment out of content especially when he knew he was speaking of his fist. He could have kept that.
I hate when jim grey does interview..  He sucks.....
So Humble God Bless you,
Tank is a beast bro I wanna see Loma next
Who the fuck is this white man telling him what he can say!!?
😳✋That FIGHT was robbery🐀. Romero got up and was good to go. Since Romero was winning most of the rounds; they stopped the FIGHT for Davis to win. What corruption! Revenge immediately!! OUT corrupt referee !!!.
he didnt have to throw hard rolly  ran into the punch
The reporter is a culture vulture 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🇨🇦🇪🇺🇬🇧🇺🇸💯
I TOLD YA KBRNES! DAVIS IS THE TANK
Don’t tell anyone what to say no matter what time it is. If he said about out to the police would you have said that??? I feel why but it was still wrong.
Gervonta wow! What a fight But most of all Youre Humble!
Ol Rolly fell into Tanks trap... Did well enough the first few rounds, and just when he thought he have it on lock, boom.. One thing I love about him was that his spirit still up. I didnt see a broken Rolly, he was just angry he fucked up 😂 i love the confidence.. he'll be ayt
Loma? Garcia? Gonna be good fight..
I’m not a fan of Rolly but Tank def struggled to get good punches. Rolly was def winning rounds. Tank just got lucky. He was lowkey scared of him
Damn Tank was trying to show some personality in the interview after the fight.  That’s wassup.
Next gervonta vs king garcia.came on
man only good hit in face it°s hard to resistance Romero
Lets go Tank🥳🥳🥳
Someone stick jim grey in the retirement home with larry merchant, the old fool. Get him off the mic saying dumb unnecessary shit.
What is up with that Grey Guy? All of a sudden he wants to be political! Showtime needs to get another announcer. He doesn't govern nothing. Where was he when the elderly were killed in Buffalo?
Lmaoaooo throwing that gun violence comment in there was soooo unnecessary. Dick move. He try to spark anything cuz Davis was not talking crazy at all. King shit. Do wanna see Rolly get back tho. People calling him trash but he really just got caught . Either way Davis will surpass that incredible 50-0 and even by a more impressive depth of fighters. Haney will b on that list Crawford too if that were to ever happen. Stevenson is the only fighter that has the composure and skill to beat him but I think the power will be the deciding factor there for Davis has the driver seat. Boxing isn’t in bad hands right now and all this YouTuber action got the fighters really trynna fight the bigger names. That being said the UFC will still become more viewed.
Muppet talking about don't talk about guns like you guys are going to stop using them... Tank meant his hands we all no what he was saying... Gun hungry Americans..
hey Jim Gray, if u wanna be upset about untimely associations w/ guns, get upset at all the politicians who attended the NRA meeting that just happened and not some1 who was using figurative speech
King Floyd. King Davis.
All those people who said rolly would knockout tank are real quiet now huh..
Jim Grey is dumb af there's a whole war going on. Let the kid shine!!
Tank is a good dude with a lot of class when it’s said and done. How could you not root for him?
This is what happens when a liberal does an interview fucks everything up congrats Tank
https://youtu.be/u_5cfr6TU5w
The interviewer was lame af. He needs to be fired for being a buzzkill
I find it funny how Teo put 100k on Rolly 🤣
Tank saw that cross coming from yesterday lol. Glad he won 🤙🏾
Thats tank been supporting since a amateur now u up here let show the rest of them like ryan and devin wassup i know tank would empty his clip out Amazing fight
That's how hard to speak English he born with that but he speaks so hard
Ain’t no safety in this glock ‼️
Jim gray is a clown he knew what the hell he meant and it’s not our people doing these mass shootings Jim gray you clown 🤡
I am gifgling to myself when he explained pushing rollie!! The glock should be his nic name
Mayweather promotions is proving he is the best. All these boxers need to sign with him. Don't get ripped off by outsiders
This mfer can fight but he sounds like he has special needs
Tank needs to work on his startup because he relies too much on his counter punching power. The fight was even until the knockout which isn't a good look since rolly isn't a good technical fighter compared alot of fighters in the division. If he goes up again people with superior technical ability that can avoid his punches throughout the fight he will lose by decision sooner or later. Same shit happened in the barrios fight. He was losing almost every round until he finally caught Barrios in the 11th round I believe. If he doesn't up the pace early he might end up losing to the top technical fighters in the division on points like Haney etc. Tank reminds me of canelo in the sense that he relies too much on his power. Power will take you so far especially when your ass is put against a good technical fighter who can avoid your power punches. That's basically why canelo lost to Mayweather and bivol.
The way he has just reacted has made him go to the very top , well done tank from England be glad to see you over here fighting soon hopefully
damn that interviewer was trynna get him cancelled at the end
I like both "TANK" UFC and BOXING.
Jim gray go away
PITBULL REMATCH!!!!
Smart fighter, good interview 👌🏾
wasn't that a rear hook? why did the old guy say  straight left
These boxers will not reach the manny pacman level of excitement coz they are running all the time.. UFC rules
he is a young classy champ…with power too! TANK!💪🏼😎
Leave it to a white man to take something out of context
As much as we might wanna clown Rolly, we still have to give him his respect cause he put up a great fight
Congratulations to Gervonta Davis, well done!
No one can knock those very nice teeth off Tank 👌
Jim should lose his job what a scumbag
In the words of tank davis: Aint no safety on this glock...and I got a lot of ammunition! Whoever is with it, lets get it!🤣🤣🤣🤣. Shout out both fighters. Congratulations Tank.
Still undefeated!
That Interviewer is a joke let’s stay away from guns ? Like get outta here with all that it’s a boxing fight tank won’t even thinking about that at all
It’s amazing how people still hating he did exactly what he said was gon do figure him out and get him out of there plan and simple 😂😂😂😂😂💯💪🏾🖤#RESPECT👑
They both misunderstanding each other I guess. Jim grey asking something else and tank answering with something else. And then the Glock thing was like a example or a parable and Jim grey says something else. Either Jim grey getting old and stupid or he was just making fun. I doubt he was making fun.
Tank stop running from KingRy an face the boy King already !!
Ayo why Jim 😂
Hats off Gervonta 🙌🏽  Rolly, you didn’t lose, you learned, hopefully.  Get your ass back and come back stronger!
I love this guy bro, “ ain’t no safety on this glock” lol great.
👌🏾 yesirrrr
Tank over tattoo
"I didn't throw that hard" lol he's still a pro boxer and a tank. That punch will knock anyone outtt.
We love Tank!
Did he really try to school a guy from Baltimore about tragedy and gun violence?    "Please"  we care about Texas as much as those latinos cared about Freddie gray!!!   come on now.
HOOD NIGGA REAL NIGGA SPEECH
The commentary at the end. Let tank say what he wants. He earned it. Ain't n9 safety on this glock! People kill people not guns. Hearts out to those who are gone recently
Good job tank✨👶✨
Jim Gray that was an unfortunate move at the end. It’s a combat sport. Don’t ruin his moment with somber unrelated news.
Tank may finally be growing into a man...
Tank was focused the whole fight his eyes stayed on Rollie Pollie 😂😂😂
Great fight salute G
Il y'a quelque chose chez gerventa qui ne va pas
nice beard :p
Team Tank dude didn't have a chance lets go Tank PFP best fighter
Tank Davis the perfect opponent for you is casimero
For all you whatever you are don't understand black people has there own language we are not you guys understand that, I understand stand clearly when he talked about his guns that them damn first you big dummy understand we are trendsetters now all of you know and if you don't you will never know, one more time we are not you people, you need to asked somebody instead of lowballing my people , it's America fault using one word with 2 meaning so stop hating because this man twist words, it's clear as day day, he doesn't need a gun for Rolly, he just knocked this man out with his 2 doggs and once he released them you see, they didn't have no name so he could not call them off him,figure that one out Mr. Quick to be negative, you hater, in the kool-aid and don't know the flavor
I didn't hear the Glock reference until just now and there was no need to throw shade at tank saying it's not the time to talk about guns I mean come on first off nobody prob even thought about the tragedy when tank made that reference and ya know why cause everyone except this Larry Merchent wanna be knew what tank was trying to say smh. Leonard Elerby in the background looking like its his first holy communion thinking here we go again another one of my fighters having beef with the boxing analyst lol
Tank timed and blocked that second punch from Rolly with his right hand all whilst delivering a devastating left hook. Boxing at the nanosecond is a beautiful beautiful thing.
Tank didn't even mean anything negative with that glock full of ammo comment nobody was thinking about the tragedys soo unprofessional by that commentator man
oh lord you cant even mention a gun now even though its OBVIOUS he is using it as a metaphor? or is everyone just trying to look like a nice person. geez. People need to go wipe their vaginas.
Really got to hat on Tank's metaphor??? All he said is he Busted on him sheesh
That was a low blow by Jim Gray. He knew exactly what Tank meant by there is no safety on this glock so why bring up the recent tragedy? Tank talking about fighting in the ring. I never seen Jim Gray fighting for BLM or anything of the sort but now all of sudden he wants to turn nothing into something smh so unprofessional and uncalled for.
Jim Gray is just like a Whiteman.   Always got to bring some political shit to boxing
What I took from that is he doesn't feel comfortable when it's too serious inside the ropes. He likes it to more fun and relaxed like it is in the gym. There's less pressure for him that way and he can perform better
What a cringe interviewer
This mf had to bring up the tx tragedy when the dude was just using a figure of speech smh. It was obvious to everyone what he meant.
Nerve of this prick, let’s stay away from guns...
Is there any chance for the Rematch with pit bull Cruz? to be honest that was a good fight.
not surprised at all,romero is a fragile dude,no chin,no strong muscles.
yeah keep fighting nameless and on a downfall fighters tank thats definitely live up to your name!!!
Jim no one cares about what you think. Just interview the boxers. 🙄
"kinda like when pacquiao got caught by.. " haha I love Tank
Next Pit bull rematch
That knockout seems like pacquiao vs marquez 4.
Tank, we love you!  I knew you would knock him out!
Was Beautiful.........
I don’t even watch this man when he fight I just place my bet and collect the debt 💸 💯show me who fucking with tank in the ring !
Lucas matthyse
White man always find a way to make a black win awkward 🤣
Please don’t be talking about no damn Glocks on national TV young black man you don’t supposed to have a Glock 🤣
Unnecessary comment by Jim Grey. That’s not what Tank meant. Let’s be clear: the gun isn’t the problem. The person who used the gun is the problem. Guns don’t kill people. People kill people. #wakeup
really awesome Mr.
That was a fight awesome boxing
Am i the only one that genuinely dislikes Jim Gray??
My guy! Tank
bro Tank a street prophet. This nigga preach. heartfelt as a black.
Fucking oath bruv shut down the talk shitters let them know we real hittaz
Congratulations Tank I knew you will win
Doesn't need to be a hard shot to ko someone. All it takes is the perfect timing, perfect technique. A jab can ko someone. Romero walked into that punch
Rolly took a dive
Jim Gray is frustrating sometimes. Tank meant no harm whatsoever. He tried to make it into something it was not. If you don’t get the metaphor that’s on you, if you get it and tried to make it something it wasn’t then you’re just being a dick. Great tactical and patient fight Tank. Well done.
Respect to this man is a true warriors true champ  Humble interview salute champ congrats.
“Guns don’t kill people stupid MF’s with guns kill people “ ~ Franklin Maurice Hatchet
Some people in the Latino community are being toxic over tank's win. Like are you even a real boxing fan ? Yikes.
Pitbull rematch
Man beautiful seeing bros growth 🙏🏾 forreal. Handled that post fight interview like a Champ!
I knew that this fight wouldn't go to the distance.
what an idiot of the announcer to bring up the guns and bring down the interview. We all knew what Tank was meaning by the Glock comment
Rollie what happened? U got knocked the fuck out
Jim Gray was on something else tonight.   Even though I was going with Tank whole way through.  Pre-Bout interviewing Rolly basically calling him   Stupid for not seeing what everyone else was seeing about G.T.D. Like bruh he going into a fight with confidence why would you try to throw him off with a question like that. Like imo keep it neutral don’t throw off somebodies confidence with a dumb question like that. Plus Rolly look dumbfounded after he had asked the question. Post-Bout talking about G.T.D commonly used slogan “this Glock got no safety I’m here for it” was just unnecessary from Jim Gray to make that more than it needed to be. Like he just won a fight everybody cheering for him after another KO nobody thinking about him actually talking bout glocks.  All in all it was a great fight the whole card was great people came to witness a great display of athletes hard work and dedication no need for other subjects.
That’s a g respect ✊🏽
Rolly still had some fight in him felt they stopped it to early
Lomachenko will destroy the tank!!!
Wine lose or draw ima sticking with tank ant no safety on this Glock
WHAT IS THIS HYPE!!!!! TANK FOUGHT ROLLY A UNRANKED FIGHTER!!!! CLOWN ASS SHIT LMAO 😂😂😂😂 GIVE HIM SOME NAMES NOW!!!
Hell of a fighter.. stays humble and true...but still the dude is straight dumb..lol
Este wey sí me duerme al García, Lomachenko, Haney y hasta el Kambosos...
Besides when has it ever been a pleasant time?
If you knew he was referring to his hands as his Glock then why make it political. Gray you didn’t even have to take it there.
Tank is a Beast of a guy.  Never bet against the Tank.  The Brother represents for his people
By Márquez
I really love this man such a humble and strong fighter
Davis vs Cruz 2 has to happen.
It was weird he tried to taper his freedom of speech and instead of speaking about White Privilege they want to make this about guns. No those Shooting are about these racist people feeling entitled.
That was in poor taste to put the attention on the mass shooting. He clearly wasn't talking about that you id**t
See that’s the culture differences this man tried to take a figure of speech n make it a bad thing .. get cha old ass Boy Scout ass on somewhere!!
We know what Tank Meant u don't need to make him feel uncomfortable.
3:54 FACTS,  AWFUL TIME TO MENTION GUNS IN THE CENTER STAGE AFTER WHAT HAPPEN TO THE 19 CHILDREN AND 2 TEACHERS IN TEXAS 💔
Good job tank GOD BLESS
Jim gray  👎🏽
That glock quote was dope asf
Rolly is trash give pitbull the rematch.
Jim Gray knows his own people and likely saved Tank from the Fox news Sunday cycle and some dirty politician's speech trying to deflect on the Tops and school shootings now.  Enjoy the win young man and continue to let your actions speak louder than words.
Pitbull cruz vs Tank Davis Rematch.
“Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household.”  Acts 16:31
😄 Rolly K.O.d 🥊 and TANK STILL UNDEFEATED who would had ever  guessed it. 🙋🏿‍♂️……😂
It's weird seeing tank get love. I been watching the masses hate on him for years but glad y'all finally giving him credit
loma next
Stay away from guns unnecessary
Not an interesting fight. Pitbull Cruz was way more entertaining and interesting match up with Davis. Experience to experience, skills to skills both have the same mindset.
Tank vs Pitbull 2
Jim was corny for that. hold that L Jim gray
ROLLY IS LIKE RYAN GLASS CHIN GARCIA ALL TALK
He’s fine he’ll fight in 90 days😂 tank lol
Congrats #tank
tank vs loma
The interviewer looking at any opportunity to make Gervonta look like a scumbag, trying to rile him about rollys antics and is metaphorical reference to guns.
He sat that nigga on his ass cheeks!!!
🙏🏼🙏🏼🖤🖤❤️❤️
Did told you gaser Rolly was a ticket seller ,just to collect the less check he did what he said tank would do walk into a straight left.love you tank.
Taylor vs serrano was a fight way better 👏  ..😁😁
Don’t ever forget it was a gun that stop that mad man don’t blame the guns it’s the people not the gun
Pacquiao Vs Marquez 🤣
They always look make black people look like violent or somehow we know about that Glock he was referring to boxing /fighting
he sudda sad guns dont kill people people kill people so shut up white guy
Jim Grey has been a goof every since he asked Pete rose about that gambling question. Why does this guy have a job still.
Good post fight interview unlike Romero's post fight interview later  after they cleared his head in the locker room.Still talking mad trash an not just taking the L an use it as a learning experience.
Poor bloke doesn't have two brain cells to rub together Kambosos will lap him.
American refs are whack!
Who’s this ? Boxing gotta do better who’s the bum he’s fighting ? Lol.
Yeah guns are bad mkay! What a douche comment
That announcer is absolute trash for putting focus and spinning Tank comment over the Glock to virtue signal. Trying to dim his light in his moment, not what you there to do.
Tank is an amazing fighter, too bad he talk how Floyd read
Personas como gervonta y Stevenson hacen mucho daño al boxeo, independiente de lo buen boxeador que son sus actitudes muestran una falta de educación y profesionalismo y delata que vienen de lo mas bajo de los estándares de la sociedad,son de lo peor de la sociedad pero con dinero,quitales el dinero y queda pura porquería,el boxeo no se merece gente así.
Good to see him speak and not Floyd take all his spotlight!
For some reason everyone’s hating on gervonta. I genuinely think eventho he fought someone that others would say is lesser than his previous opponents. He seems more dangerous in a way he’s more smart/he’s more patient, I genuinely think gervonta could be a problem because the way he reacted, and the way he’s been training, you can tell he has a lot more to prove and to show to us fans
Was always the way Rolly hands always too low . Tank too skillful congrats my man  .
I love tank so much more after this he a good dude
Tank vibe and energy is super dope! I wish the man nothing but the best.
He thanked God...so eermmm yeah shut up I’m out.
He been saying that come on now
Just like Pacquiao marques
He’s so humble and he always delivers Let’s  go champ
He is was simply stating his own personal way of doing his business in the Boxing ring...and his upbringing growing up in Baltimore and that doesn't has anything to do with me the current situation that happened in Both incidents that the government has been so insensitive about according to the laws of Gun laws 🙄 Reporter who is simply 🤔 trying to get brownie points from a Black Man's Triumph in a sport that is a matter of life and death...
Así  hubieras noqueado al pitbull  cruz
that reporter didn't have to correct tank about the Glock comment, we all know he just meant his hand. leave politics out of it.
Really?? Everything was good and no one was thinking or disrespecting that horrible tragedy for that guy to bring that up when Tank was just talking about boxing and answering that guys question.
Peace out Tank keep going baby
Stay Humble we love you TANK
Im glad he shut him up, Romero is annoying
Lets get Tank vs. Loma. That fight would be a banger.
EVERYTIME I see this kid....he just gets better and better
😂😂😂 my 12 year old has a stronger beard.
Rolly is about to give his best counter talktrash before he get drop
*Tank is a super sucka running like a coward‼️‼️‼️* *Imagine a mini Mike Tyson counterpunching off the back foot‼️🤯* *Ultra love & respect to **#Rolly** for doing EXACTLY what he was supposed to do‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️🔥🏆🔥*
Pitbull and rolly he got exposed a lot !!!🤣🤣🤣cherry pick after cherry pick and still struggling !!!
I dont know tank very well. I was rooting for rolly because I like his tony ferguson weirdness and I thought of tank as a typical cocky thug type. But the way he handled this post fight interview earned my respect. The kid is humble and respectful
Tank got a glass chin
GOOD JOB EXECELLENCE OF EXECUTION TANK GOD BLESS YOU,YOUR HUMBLE YOU SHUT HIM UP AND WERE THE BETTER MAN.
He's very humble..way to go the "TANK"💪💖
Tank got a weak ass chin 🤣🤣🤣
good fight tank
Pitbull cruz2 MX poder 👊 y que no le huya no dio revancha
First he said that he got into his head  But rolly had him under control
Poised and composed - after the win. Impressive. Twice. Congrats.
Repent Israelites all praise to the most high YAHAWAH AND HIS SON YAHAWASHI🙏🏽🛸🛸🛸🛸🤴🏽🦁⌛️🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏🏽
He didn’t throw  that hard however when you get the very right connection and timing , it’s a whole different story
He tried to speak so humbled they kept trying to get him to talk down on Rollie
There was only 20 seconds left in the round when the ref waved it off, should have given him a chance to get the corner at least.
Tank is actually a nice guy.
if a man can lose so many rounds and come out with one shot at this weight to change the outcome it's pretty amazing. tank is a real champ
Its a figure of speech. Smh.. That man has freedom of speech to say what he wanna say..Please.. If he knew what he meant why say anything 🤡
JIM GRAY FUCKED UP JUST LIKE LARRY MERCHANT DID BACK IN THE DAY💯MAKING STUPID STATEMENTS ✔
hahaha mayabang kasing magsalita tong si Romero,si Pacquiao daw ang may pinaka worst na boxing style sa mga bosingero.yun na Ala pacquiao ka tuloy...
Absolutely unimpressive... That set-up for the counter was so obvious. I woulda eased off the pressure and made the necessary adjustments... He woulda never caught me.
That’s why everybody booing you 😂😂
Looklike pacquiao marquez
From where Tank has come from in his life he comes across as a respectful man!
To early fight for Rollo what did you expect. Rollo did great but made a early professional mistake. Or amateur mistake. I hope this mistake don’t cause him his career.
America just keeps showing their HATRED towards GOD’S CHOSEN PEOPLE EVEN DURING THEIR PROSPERITY SMH THE DEVILS THE SCRIPTURES SPEAKS OF!!!! 😒
This is tank..i like how he approach in this build up before the fight..he show how calm he is inside the ring never mix with emotion ..that what Muslim Islam taught us as person
Thanks for the condolences of the Hispanic kids that died in texas
PACQUIAO FANS HAVING FLASHBACKS TO WHEN MARQUEZ SNATCHED MANNY'S SOUL💯DON'T GET IT TWISTED. THAT KNOCKOUT MADE PAC-MAN LOOK DEAD AF. JINKY WAS HYSTERICAL ✌🏿
Good interview..Tanks fast becoming self expressive. Thay is growth.
One thing I can say bout tank is , I wasn't a fan until tonight , seeing how humble tank seemed after the fight , speaks volumes to me.. Way to go champ 🏆 a "W" well deserved!! Oorah!!!
Oh we can't talk about guns right now! Man go sit your butt down somewhere! Trying to tell that man what he can and can't talk about after he just got throught competing in a sport that could have killed him! We all knew what he was referring to! STOP IT!
I'm split on that as we do need to be cautions with the times but dude could had just said people he is referring to his fists just to lighten it up a bit
AIN'T NO SAFETY ON THIS GLOCK 💯
I like this guy. I thought he was one of mayweathers cocky student or some sort. But he’s really good 👍🏼. Congrats Tank!
Disgraceful from the man to put tank on the spot like that. We all know what he meant when he said his glock is not on safety
It not Tank or anyone that looks like him doing these mass shootings.
Tank is growing up to be  a true Man .. Very respectful after the fight . So remember skills pays the bills regard less if you think your strong .It doesn't matter .If your bread for this boxing then you are the chosen one .💪💪💪🚸🚸🚸🚸🚸🙏
Anybody who thought Rolly had even 1% chance to win are delusional and  obviously don't even watch boxing
Very mature interview by Tank good luck to Roland Romero on his next fight.
Jim Gray is always doing some dumb shit…. He turned into something else.  Nobody was even thinking about gun violence. Wtf.
I was waiting for the main event, and when it arrived. My mother asked me to make some tea for her, i told her i would make some after the fight. And faster if the fight ended by KO
Politics that's why he said that , if you know why what you say that, because  politics,  they want people  guns so bad
What kind of champion is that all covered in tattoos..wtf..what happened  to real athletes who would represent a sport like real men with class not some street hoodlums..anything goes now days.
Bro seriously why does he have 2 lines on his face looks sooo stupid guy if u can’t grow a beard just shave
Now we know how strong Pitbull is.   Tank Davis don't want to fight him again. iMAO..
yo, i wasn't even thinking about guns in that way until that interviewer made it weird.  def too disconnected of a man to interview during tough times.  you're done old man
Ryan queen Garcia would get slept after watching this fight he telling oscar hold me back a few more years idk add my hand broke! 🤣
Davis sounds like he's raised properly by his parents. A humble person but gives you entertaining fights.
Dog remind me of Sanford and Son Red Foxx, all jokes aside the best man won.
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾GTD😎🥊🥊💪🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
ryan next fith
Don’t mention guns? What an asshole
Jim Gray should get fired for his consistent use of unsavory and unnecessary comments!
I said exactly. Romero is still too young compared to David.
why did he call tank out on that gun comment 💀, ruined the moment
Like I said before ,!!!rolly will be in future YouTube videos whene trash talkers get destroyed,!!
Showtime...fire this guy already!  Wow!  I was drunk watching this interview...even i could related to Tank's "glock have no safety"!  What a piece of sh!T...
I'm so proud of this young man ,the way he handled the media 👏 🙌 🙏  never  boast  but just talked about the  fight.  Let me say this, this guy is predestined to become one of the all time greatest 🙌
"the time is now"😁👍much respect for the tank
Muscle memory did it again. Hard word and dedication!
“Ain’t no safety on this Glock”
Lil ryan take  notes stay in your lane ...
Congrats To Tank, Fick Jim Gray, making tanks comments political......2A.......
There’s no safety on this Glock was the most savage thing I’ve heard Davis say, unfortunately Jim Gray ruined with his unnecessary comment
A Champion and a Class Act 💪🏾💚🏁
Jim Gray is such a buzz kill 😂
Much respect to Tank for the way he handled that interview. Like this dude.   It maybe time to go into full Maywether mode now;getting hit is for fools
Cheap talks cost rolly a fight
You can tell he didn’t throw that hard.. That’s the scary part
It's always the one you don't see
The way he knock out his opponent, the way he answered the question inside the ring is completely DAMMMMMMMN,. He's is better and good person  than gayweather
Gervota tank Davies
Great win for tank but now step your game up and quit knocking out b-c list fighters!!!!!!
tank was super classy and gracious in victory.... ultra likeable.... won a bunch of new fans on this performance!
Tank vs Loma enough of the Tomato cans
Mayweater promotions also send you to school.very satisfied interview
Real talk Rolando did way better than what I expected. He boxed well but all it takes is one shot when your hands are down
Its because rolly is scared thats how hes down just with that left punch
“He’ll be able to fight again in 90 days”😭😭😭🤣
"We settled it like a man in the ring, I wish him the best in the future" That's real mf talk right there. Better put some respek on Tanks name after that.
Tank is a stud boxing world is yours champ
Very likeable humble champ Old man had no right killing his vibe
That shit was so annoying. I loved Tanks attitude an comments during that interview and that douchebag had to make it weird and uncomfortable. The only thing annoying about what he said is my wife has talked shit like a hundred times just to tell me to watch my ass this Glock ain’t got no safety, fuck my life 😒 😂
Tank isn't ready for the big leagues. Probably won't ever be ready at this point.
Fake. They pay him to fake a knockout
That whole reeling in of the gun comment was awkward. He was clearly talking about his hands being as they are considered lethal weapons. There was no need to ruin the interview just so it could be “politically correct”!!
This reporter needs to take a lap, we all know what tank meant but this foo here gotta go ahead and ruin some moments. Get him outta here
I really hope they have a podcast after this
smh clown OF COURSE hes gonna say he didnt throw hard punchs after the fight lolb
This nikka say less stay away from god wtf is going on with this industry   I hope god go and see you tomorrow to see if you will say that 💪🏽
Spoken like a true champ! 🏆🥊💯
He ran straight into a Tank
I love tge fact Tank gaining some confidence to talk by himself.
napakagandang laban kung nagabot sila ni pacman ...di mo masasabi sino mananalo kung naglaban dalawa
Tank is more exciting boxer and much better than Mayweather.
I hella respect this dude now, for the way he chose to not be cocky (his own words, more or less). That was a super professional way to handle that interview, especially even after all the talking Rolando did. I really respect that.  But at the same time, all that talk Rolando was doing definitely put a lot more eyes on this fight. I think Tank knows that, and is ok with that. He seems to not want to be that guy that talks trash because it's just not part of his essence and doesn't want to force himself to do it. So I think that helps him be able to be humble in victory rather than shit talk. But were human, and this is just how handled it at this particular moment. I might spill water on me one day and not care and laugh, the next time I could be cussing, who knows.. And this being his last fight under Mayweather, (or whatever) with the all the talking, his performance and his professionalism in the post fight interview is a going to be a great catapult for his next fight. Which will be the first fight on his own/out from under Mayweather (or whatever).   I personally am looking forward to his next fight now, especially if it's against the winner of the Haney ve Kambosas fight. A rematch some years in the future would be a good money fight, too.
Congratulations tank
I hope every one of you that said Romero gone knock Tank out or even beat him. I hope you are all sitting there thinking, I haven’t got a clue about boxing 😂😂 there was a LOT of you as well a LOT
Tank’s burns is crazy lmao
Tank Davis Looks like he has a parkinson's Symptom.?
That commentator sickens me with his snarky sanctimonious bullshit. He knew what Tank meant analogy wise about the Glock reference and just took it all the way left🤨. I'm glad Tank shrugged him off.
Man, why he gonna try and steal Tanks thunder with the, “let’s stay away from guns” man it ain’t guns. It stupid a$$ people! Guns been around for a long min and stupid people just keep getting dumber! Tank ain’t got no safety on that Glock and plenty of ammo! Let’s go!
This is a great version of tank....showing alot of maturity...hats off to the young champion...new York fucks with tank for sure
idol kona si davis
Boxing has to step up the game with better competitive fights 😂😃😂 please save boxing
Someone cancel Jim Gray’s old ass. He indirectly brought up that Texas shooting situation to make Davis look like an ass. Davis was not in that head space. Davis had good happy intentions.
Tankk
https://youtube.com/shorts/qiDRI3NF7dY?feature=share
I'm tired of the mis match 🤣🤣🤣 lmfao ppv not competitive at all shit
I'm tired of seeing the skilled versus the non skilled dude has what 14 12 fights jeeez
Rolly could of continued no shit it wasn’t that hard
Easiest fight for tank ever. Rolly has no chin or skills his another teofimo lopez delusional.
Honestly no hate toward jim gray but that comment was SOO DUMB like bro why say that?
Lmao my g they’re ain’t no safety on this Glock 😂
Interviewer is a fruitcake
He'll be good in 90 day's 😂
He’s foul for trying to link tank’s comment to the tragedies that have happened it had NO way what so ever to do with tanks comment but that’s a Amerikkkan guy for you that’s his MO with Black boxers T like the great Warner Wolve would say check the video tapes he always has slick foul talk towards black boxers check all his comments towards Mayweather.✌🏿❤️
Did he really say something about guns and chill with gun talk what a corn ball. He didn't mean that in threatening way at all
I like tank his nice
Cancel that dude interviewing tank with his comments
Garbage 🗑️ can ppv boxing is the new WWE smackdown boxing era pure garbage competition
That punch was definitely cherry picked 🍒🤏
Pitbull cruz rematch
Precision beating power.
That was lame that Gray checked him on talking about guns as if America, a country that REFUSES to change gun laws because a bunch of right-wing morons keep blocking it, doesn't have a mass shooting every week.
I'm glad that I'm on the road so that I wouldn't be tempted to pay to see that bullshit I was hoping to see Tank torture that boy.
Why tf Jim Gray even say anything about the guns? Shit was unnecessary af
It's easy to like a humble champion. Congrats Tank.
"1st thank God" always thank God for everything, awesome tank Davis a truly warrior and humble figthter congrats bro...you made it...💪
CMON BRUH LET HIM TALK ABOUT THE GUNS LMOAAAOAOAOA
Caught him slippin outside 😂😂😂
Old boy was tripping on Gervontas gun comment he didn't need to bring politics into  it I'm sure as old as he is he knows that guns don't break out their safety devices sprout legs and run up to people and shoot them
Empty tins make a lot of noise. I nu from the beginning.
I don't mind what the interviewer did. We too desensitized to gun violence period. It's not just towards Tank. He was talking to the audience
THERE WAS NO NEED 4THIS FIGHT!! ROLLIE TALKED HIS WAY N2 A FIGHT!! What u saw was a mature fight/fighter!! TANK vs his sparring partner!! BIG MOUTH!! Gray ain't evn have to brng attn to what Tank said!! IT'S BOXING TALK and unlike him, he was just boxing 2mins prior/no time to "chose his wrds"!!!
Easy work we'll done
He said like he kill Ali or Tyson 😅... Rolly is not first class fighter, everyone understands it. According to Floyd, Tank won't have a great legacy, because of money 💸
I want to thank Tank, I didn't know that Gary Russell Sr had passed away 😢😢😢😢
I didnt trow that hard 😅 its just like pacquiao trow the hitman night night
His face had more damage than rollys. How did rolly do in the fight up until he got KO’D
Tank Davis a Dog! 🔥🔥🔥 🙏🏾🙌🏾💔💪🏾💯
Classy interwiew,no hate no cockyness but respect toward somebody insulted him so long.Champ
Jim Gray was protecting Tank from the PC squad from coming for Tank’s image an name. He clearly did that to show Tank is aware and is humble enough to admit he got caught up in the fight spirit and means no harm to those suffering from gun violence. He even reached out to Tank after the interview an likely told him I knew what you meant but I know the public in current times may feel differently
“Thank god he good. He’ll be able to fight again in 90 days” idk y that’s killing me 😂😂
I could’ve sworn Davis compared himself to Tyson and Canelo. I like Tank but his last 2 fights he’s had more of a finesse counter puncher style and he’s been on his back foot. Good KO and all he was able to counter Rollie. His style has changed a bit now that the competition he’s facing has improved. If this is the new style he’s going to stick to his nickname “tank” should be changed to Pretty Boy Jr. or something like that especially with the nail polish this “gangsta” has been wearing.🤣 na but in all seriousness I didn’t see a “Tank” tonight or against “Pitbull” who actually lives up to the name no matter the opponent win or lose.
Tank’s maturity growth is impressive, he could’ve completely went off on Rolly, he’s becoming more and more scarier to fight.
Good fight Tank..stay humble..and don't worry bout this playing stupid commentator..we all know what u meant and so was he...i wish it was Mike Tyson the one  interviewing in that specific moment and see Mike putting this clown commentator in place.
And who tf get hyped by this bum fight🤦
Still didn’t have the balls to call out any champion directly 🤔
In a lot of people minds Tanks comment was out of line but we do have freedom of speech regardless to what's going on in America.  I don't like the comment the from the old man commentating trying to put Tank out there but life goes on.
Rolly is a very sore loser! I had him in all 6 rounds so lets run it back because i was hurting him and exposing him until i walked into a good punch! Wth is that??
It may not be a Floyd Mayweather yet, but there isn’t much left to that standard anymore! It's no coincidence that Floyd chose him!
What kind of comment was that knowing we all call our fist guns and the ones that these punk cowards out here that shoot kids,black unarmed people ,and drive bye shooters are the real punk cowards
Awesome
Him and Gary Russell would be a good match. I'd take Russell honestly. His skillset is a few levels ahead of Tank. But tank has the power.
Jim Gray need to be talking about anti-lynching law for African-Americans
It’s common sense his Glock references wasn’t referring to the tragedies that have taken place recently, keep boxing about boxing Jim you idiot… Great Win & Post Fight Interview Tank WE KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
Who wants garcia vs davis?
Without ppl most guns cant really shoot or kill its always been about the psychos and killers not the guns and tank isnt even talking about a gun itself🤦
Talked all that noise and got his azz knocked out 😂😂
Let the man enjoy his win a nigga don't shot up schools
Unstoppable Tank 💯💯💯💯
He's a bully in that division!
I can’t believe that old white man made that awkward ass statement about guns knowing what Tank meant like Fam he was already being humble why ruin the moment
Jim Gray is a dick. He tried to incite controversy even after Tank said thank you to Rolly. Then he lectures Tank about guns when Tank used a metaphor about how he’s ready and his got a lot of ammo to box anyone. Fire this clown 🤡
Let the man enjoy his win damn
They luv to try to take shine away from Tank. “Ain’t no safety on this Glock” he said what he said 👑💪🏾
Outcome was inevitable. I don't like social media but might start a boxing betting advisory channel. I can see through muddy water and spot dry land. We need to petition to get Jim Gray out of there. Him and Larry Merchant have disrespected so many great fighters over the years who put their lives on the line. They always have a condescending vibe during fighter interviews. Jim Gray needs to catch a good fade to change his perspective on fighting in general. Tank has matured by light years very impressive personal development.
Is he punchy???
Everyone knows what tank meant, the interviewer should be fired for putting tank out like that. I’m glad he ignored that idiot.  Ain’t no safety on Tank facts. Great fight.
Gervonte is very humble for a young man.
This was Tank's moment  - before, during  and after the fight. Well played son!
Doesnt hit that hard but he got rocked multiple times lol
Niggas get killed  everyday in the hood?Jim don't pull that card
Congrats champ your skill are combination of floyd and pacman  🤘😎
Tank was quite respectful in post fight interview
See how the media works they're already trying to tell people you can't say the word gun like guns are bad they fail to understand that it is the damn people that are the bad ones guns are not evil people are evil that was unnecessary for him to try to correct tank and mess up his shine for that moment.
Congratulations tank Ryan said he want you next
Gary  Russell
He gone cry in the car......haha
Dude is weak for mentioning guns and killing the man’s joy .
Interviewer is a wet wipe, get rid.
bra. dont kill the vibe old man. he only meant any fighter can get the gloves. we might as well not call him tank nomore then fuckin with his old ass
Bruh rocked that snotbox real good !!! LOL
Right now , he need fight with the elite ..please
👊🏽
Them veneers wayyyyyy to big for yo mouth boy 😂 🐰
You gotta love Tank…. He got the Mayweather legacy
Davis Vs Haney next! No other fight makes any sense, provided Haney wins next week!
"let's stay away from guns" that was wack as hell to say smh..
I knew all along that Rolly's power would be a challenge for Tank, so he would have to fight patiently and wait for openings.  My only concern was whether or not Tank would fight smartly and not get careless.  Rolly is naturally heavier than Tank and extra strong for his weight class and that makes him very formidable for someone Tank's size.
guns don’t kill people dumb mf with guns do ! if mf was getting stabbed to death what would you say then ?
Rolly diff hit hard. If he didnt, you would have just walked him down like all his other opponents. Tank still a fuking g tho. Good ass ko
Jim Gray is old, out of touch and corny. Showtime needs to find someone else to do their boxing interviews.
Just another hypejob he looked bad vs romero was losing the fight. Facts are facts.    Like kambosos,loma and teofmio etc.. all are above him.
Get out of here with that PC crap, Jim Gray…. Old fool… 🤡
Where is Rolly fans? Speak up or forever hold your peace. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Terrible interviewer
5-0 Rollo... got clipped got up n ref ain't even give him a chance 4 fights 4 knockouts and you will be facing him again
i just ony one can say to romero.. 😂 😂 😂 😂 what happen to you.. you have only a big mouth romero you dont believe of Pacquiao.. KARMA is BACK.. 😂 😂
Rollie just got Marquezed!
It was inevitable rolly was going to sleep sooner or later valiant effort but he aint ready for the big time
This is honestly why hes my favorite boxer especially since I’m just now getting into boxing heavily, tank really doesn’t do much talking at all he just fights man
Rolly is not ready for a title fight yet,let tank fight Loma.
Good job brother BLM
For the life of me idk why these fighters don't listen to gus. Watch tyson. You have to be able to slip that. But he was pressing hard, threw a jab and left his jaw unprotected. If you wanna be the best, imitate them.
Y'all kissin tank as! But he ran 75% of the time! It's a reason why he has not fought one top 5!!! We talk about Ryan but at least he fought Campbell
Never throw 3 same combinations in a row. I think tank did it to his last opponent before barrios. Dude throw 3 same punches/combinations in a row and got cracked. Just my amateur analysis.
that was solid counter he get confident when he see davis hit by his punch and counter with a bomb..
I’ve been watching most of all tanks fights and out of all he’s opponents the only one that made him look average and took it to him and went the 12 rounds was pitbull cruz!
Tank is getting better at speaking. I remember when people used to call him Duh-vonta Davis
Bro really brought up not the best time to talk about guns my man tank was in his moment had nothing to do with politics.
If that was GGG making the ammunition comment would that interviewer had replied the same? 🤔
They need to fire jim gray dude always seem like he got a stick in his ass man!!! Out with the old in with the new
STAY STRAPPED.🙂
Pitbull cruz 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
He is mayweather with knockout power
Davis copied that left counter punch from 8 x division PacMan! Good job man! Hope Davis & Garcia will fight very soon! Thats gotta be awesome! 👍
Bro why are old heads asking questions
Same KO by Pacman to Hatton
Now Rolly understand the phrase there's levels to this shit.
Congrats Tank. Stay humble my boi don't let Floyd change ur ways.
"Let's stay away from guns this is an awful time in our nation, I know your just meaning this in terms of boxing" ... okay wtf ?? Everyone knew what he meant and no one was even thinking about that so why even bring it up ? .. Idiot
respect to TANK
It's like when Pacquiao knocked out Ricky Hatton. Exactly the same except, Ricky fell asleep.
...Like I'm no petty person, but I really hope someone checks tf out of Jim Gray. Like, mf the glock comment was OBVIOUSLY metaphorical. Said that mess as if Tank's comment is the stuff school shooters are made of...gtfoh 😑😑. Tell that mess to your colleagues spreading the sh.t all over the news stations...
БУЙРАБАС ШЕШЕНАМЫ КРАСАВЧИК
Tank didn’t mean it like that white boy!!   “Glock stay off safety “
Wow the man right there
tank makeing the fight game worth watching again..real shit..
All that Rolly talked pre fight " I will ko Tank in  one round "  and he knocked the F out in the 6th round without much of any force  . Happened so fast he didn't see that . Talked too much sh&t and over confident . ONLY COUPLE OF BOXERS CAN GIVE TANK PROBLEMS WHICH ARE SHAKUR  STEVENSON AND  DEVIN HANEY  BUT STILL WON'T BE THAT EASY .  TANK IS A DAWG FOR SURE .
Wassup with them sideburns
The TANK ran his ass over 🔥
If the boxing thing doesn't work out, maybe you could be the 7th Island Boy
Imagine covering the combat sport of boxing as long as Jim Gray has and you pretend to not understand the context of Tanks comments. What a condescending clown to take that out of context. What’s with these Larry Merchant type of old heads covering these sports, they seem so out of touch.
Wla talaga boxing Ngayon laban Ngayon Pera Pera nlang bakit timigil Ng  agad laua mg lalaban
Baltimore love New York. We love yall too
The interviewer had to ruin it at the end
BOMMMMM 😂😂😂😂😂💀
Of course he didn’t have to throw that hard. Cause he (Rolly) walked into that punch.
That 6th round TKO must be the most satisfying guerdon of Tank's career, especially if you consider all the pre-fight trash talk and garrulity from his opponent, and the Mayweather contract debacle.
It's your people with all the Guns Mr. Announcer., Left, Right - Bang, Bang, the way we used to settle disputes .
i really dislike jim gray's face and his condescending voice...
Jim Gray 😑 What is wrong with that dude? Guess he is getting too old.
Garcia don’t want that smoke 🦆🦆🦆
Come on Tank don’t do that..
He already is ,has been a Great Fighter ! I believe he will beat them all .
Nothing but love for tank. Hes a true prizefighter. He will destroy Garcia/kambosos/Haney
Congratulations Champ!! & good luck to Rolly.
Really Jim??? 🙄🙄
genio
He ran right into a wall "he might of just feel rite on da floor if da ropes weren't there" FACTS💯
Bro the commentators really disrespecting rollie tho
https://youtube.com/shorts/7UrsCw10FQo?feature=share 😈
Great spotsmanship young man we need more. Of that in our community. We don't Mexicans to sell a fight. Although Rolly is Puerto Rican. He did not show sportsmanship
I'd like to see Ryan Garcia fight Tank
man the guy had to make his reference wrong
Man sthu we knew what he was talking bout it's a damn boxing turn
Imagine if he hit him with power . He would’ve went through the ropes 😂
Imagine if the punch had some heat behind it.
Davis haircut remind me sugar ray leonard🤣🤣🤣
Tank didn't mean no disrespect just exited to shut motor mouth.  Great win let's see Tank vs Cruz 2 .
Those movement looks like paq vs haton.
It’s the punch’s you don’t see
Gun comment wasn’t necessary.  He knew Tank didn’t mean that literally
When TANK was watching da replay of knocking his ass off his feet he said owww yeah like I did Dat romero looked drunk walking his bitch ass all da way back to his locker room it's was worth every penny to watch it on ppv.
My best boxer in this era for my opinion small giant
𝐺𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑎 𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑑 𝑊𝑒𝑙𝑙 .....✌️🥊
"Ain't no Safety on this Glock"😆👊🏾
Why utilize fake media propaganda to belittle or demonize his "Glock with no safety" analogy. It had nothing to do with literally killing innocent women, children, animals, or people in general 🤦🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️.
Shut him up! Congratulations champ🎉🎉🎉
tank is surprisingly humble
I want Mayweather to fight this guy lol
Tank is maturing and coming into is own self.
https://youtube.com/channel/UCkVRbFH5WEzsmGnBpcYlWAQ
He kinda talk like Mike Tyson 🤣
Accuracy 🎯 over power💥
Jim Gray continues to be a scumbag he will never change
lucky punch
Tank : “He the one ran into something talking bout me. He gone be able to fight again in 90 days.”  Aye tank funny as fuck for that one 😂😭🙌🔥😂😁🔥
Afraid of cruz rematch
He’s a nice young fighter
Pitbull isac Cruz still standing  He definitely did not knock him out or did any damage I would like to see a rematch
Tank is special Ed for real 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 didn't answer Jim Grey's question about what he was saying during the fight to Rolly he brings up getting into his head during the weigh in 😂🤣😂🤣.......... Good fighter though not a fan but great fighter just a very unintelligent one outside the ring lol
Jim made it so awkward after that gun comment it was unnecessary let tank express himself it wasn’t even offensive
Jim Gray with his slick ass comments and micro aggressions towards black fighters!
I like Tim but don't do Tank like dat wit da gun comment.... he was on a victory high...don't make him a gif for no reason
I like Tim but don't do Tank like dat wit da gun comment.... he was on a victory high...don't make him a gif for no reason
Some family member of a victim came to watch the fight and forget what happened just to get reminded again🤣
You earn this tank KO
They need to fire that interviewer for that comment 🤦‍♂️ why bring that into it and act like it’s the guns fault anyway. Tryna make tank look like a bad guy
Jim"fuckn" grey,must he always control thee damn narrative? Sum freakn' people wit there steel the show,control issueslol Larry merchant 2.0
Tank is humble thats why i dont think he will ever get that mayweather money people paid alot of money to see mayweather lose i dont see that with tank everybody wants to see him win which will be less money
My best my fevrate boxer in world
that was an amazing counter left hook knockout
BALTIMORES OWN DID IT AGAIN! Ugg.
He has grown and matured I like his comment at the end of the fight like Davis growth as a fighter congratulations king and keep going
That dude kill the moment when he said : let's not talk about guns. Screw him. Go ahead and support the kool-aid heads.
Damn! I thought he was going to send his condolences, to the families of the Texas shooting victims.
Jim Gray is a jerk.
Why would he reference the shooting in a post interview of a boxing match. Can we get some better commentators?
Mad respect for tank. Very respectful and being him. It’s just the way he talks don’t take it out of context! Thanks dude now we won’t be able to hear him being him! Talk about why the feds didn’t rush with their Glocks n heavy ammo if you gonna bring that bs up dude! Congrats Davis enjoy well deserved
Man can say what he qant ...yall do no matter what is going on ...why I don't ever see no black interviewers after the fight
"I was thinking, as you know,  this interview was coming up, as much as I wanted to be cocky but I want to thank Rolly, I want to thank his team. We settled it like a man inside the ring and I wish him the best in the future."  Such a class act. What a champ
This humble behavior is the sign of greatness I have never seen a humble boxer
The soon to be face of boxing just out-sold cherry picking Clenelo
Congratulations Tank it was a suppurb performance!
Love it when the shit talker  losses
Tank is a beast
where is rolly ?
Knock2 Who's there? Rolly Romero Rolly Romero who? Exactly! 😂😂😂
Terriffic fight congratulations to Davis, skills beat brute strength. And its was not like JMM KOing Pac, that fight Pac really was dropped with a bomb the same punch JMM was practicing and strengthening over and over again in his training. Rolly was floored by a quick tap by Davis man..
Ain’t No Safety On This Glock. Bro Gotta Be Careful. They Could Fine His Ass And He Could Get Fired.
That guy who fought Pacquiao is way a head of you Davis
Stop it  your know he was talking about his hands ..white people always try to paint u bad some kind of way if u don't lose
Eat crow ROLLY fans told. You davis victory
Stay away gun comments wtf it’s a free country had nothing to do with guns Jesus Christ he votes for biden
He tried it.........he tried to play Tank about "NO SAFETY ON HIS GLOCK "..... obviously this is boxing and it's  MEADIPHOR !!!........ F.O.H........."SALUTE TO NO SAFETY TANK DAVIS "
What a classy guy  He has a massing boxing IQ power in both hands and great ring craftsmanship. Now he’s free from Mayweather promotions, hope he goes on to make some mega money and retires as one of the greats
Let's Goooooooooo Champ 👑
THAT CLOWN AZZ INTERVIEWER NEED NOT TALK TO TANKS ABOUT GUNS. THAT WAS ANTHER WHITE BOY WHO KILLED ALL THEM KIDS.AND TEACHERS.TANK HAD NOTHING.TO WITH TERRORIST THAT IS COMMITTED BY WHITE FOLKS AND TANK HAD NOTHING TO WITH ALL THEM COWARD.AZZES POLICE OFFICER REFUSING TO DO THE JOBS. THEM YELLOW BELLY COWARD POLICE SHOULD ALL BE FIRED, THEY ALL HAD WEAPONS AND  BULLET PROOF VESTS AND STILL SHOW  THE WHOLE WORLD  THAT THEY ARE COWARD
u got unfibished buisnuis with cruz
People who said tank is humble must've never seen what he did after he beat rolly
He a b**** for bringing up what happened to them kids, he knew that's not what he ment hate that shit. Smh
Tank is humble in victory.  His true gift is the ability to calm down after a fight.  Tyson didn't have the ability to turn it off.
Rolly got his A$$ Rolled right outta Brooklyn 😂🤣😂🤣
What kind of jab was that he was trying to throw before he got KNOCC THA PHUK OUT..
It was nice to see Tank thank Rolly and his team... Great night
Thanks God as his first words that all i need to hear. This young man is special in so many ways .
This fool trying to get all PC on Tank. He’s the one that made it about the shooting not Tank. I really don’t like that guy lol
pitbulll sounds familiar
He's a kid who just fought a tough fight. Still in beast mode . When you get asked questions right after a fight I'd like to see these people react infront of millions. It may have been bad timing but the comment was no how related to the school shooting. Nor should anyone be crucified for talking about a gun. Quit the PC shit. Dudes a human with a heart .of course he wouldn't wish the ills of what happend on anyone.
Did I see rolly close his eyes .....he knew he was outta there
That was extra what that commentator did. This man just finished a fight. It's not like he meant it that way. Adrenaline still be rushing through these guys veins.
But glocks have no safety…
Boxer sounds so nice:)
The ring announcer trying to make the gun metaphor sound negative pissed me off. We all know what he meant and this absolute snowflake had to ruin it. Seriously, that’s BS.
I dont really fuck with gervonta but im started to like him cause hes like mayweather but more calm and respectful. This dude actually be honest
Oooooooooooo
Like pacquiao knocking hatton
Butter roll just went to the sleep even by one lame shot!😂🥴
Tank will kill Ryan Garcia fo sho
White man always tryna censor shit , let that man have his moment .
Rolly and his Coach so disrespectful they don't deserve a rematch even after they still using insult words
Never knew Tank had diamonds 💎 in his canines... That's different and kinda dope imo
So happy for tank... Ole boy was irritating no need to have said that
He’s a great fighter
Talk to the white kids about the gun comment
Somebody teach that boy how to speak
Well done The Tank👍
And all that counted him out, was right. Tank ain't to be played with
Jim need to chill. Let Tank have his moment. Don’t spoil it
tank need to rematch issaccruz if he not fighting the big names like Loma Ryan or winner of Haney vs kambosos
He's cockiness is well calculated and I'm loving it
That’s the end of it with that bum. Now I’ll tell you what he’s going to do to coddle his bruised ego. Go on Instagram flash money talk about how he had the guts to fight tank and not all these other fighters lol rolly is a joke devin would have beaten him up badly.
If you gonna fight lomachenko dont offer him money in exchange of not getting youre ass kick 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'll know tank out 5 round
Hey Jim, how about you leave the politics out and focus on asking boxing related questions.
Tank meant well when he made the gun reference. People gotta relax this stuff been going on check the history.
Jim gray STFU you know what he meant 🙄
Rolly was definitely in his head with this fight he wasn’t ready  He was so scared of the KO that shit ended up landing lol  DAVIS FTW
Sold his soul. Brain damage and face tats
That dude with the gun talk omg shut that up wtf great job champ
Why is this a surprise? This was a forced fight for rolly? Rolly game is too sloppy for Davis. I predicted Davis ko would come from a counter because rolly fights so sloppy. In fact one of rolled last fights was an upset call. He didn't even belong in the ring with davis.
I feel like that was a terrible interviewer  Next time get someone else to do it lol
Man tank meant what he said💯💪🏾 we know he ain’t talkin bout real guns. If this wasn’t televised and ran a certain way, whitey would caught a left hook too
The interviewer did not have to bring it to that…. Tank was not meaning it in that way. That was awful
Oscar Valdez vs Berchelt- Pacquiou vs Marquez - Davis vs Romero all similar endings
Ref got paid to stop it.
Another one bites the dust lol 😂
why do people thank god for the victory.  smh
Just to chime in on the announcers idiot comment about guns... the guns ain't the problem, and stupid comments like this are an attempt to avoid the real issues so just stfu.
Tank such a delight to watch. He is boxing.
Rolly really thought he was going to knock out tank🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂😂😂😂tank is so funny how many time you flich and it looked like tank was a lil scared lol looking at the other fights
That's how champions talk no matter the race! Awesome work brother!!
I ain’t even watch the fight yet smh
Let's stay away from the guns this a awful time in our nation man shut the hell up. You knew what he was referring too smh. Damn guy will mess up a wet dream great job tank
Keep God first and everything else will fall in place.. Salute GTD 🦍 🥊
monotonous match and very unattractive to watch
The first sentence it makes You champ ✓
Wowww
Time for Tank to humble Ryan Garcia
How come there was no Cruz rematch?
He needs to fight lomachenko next tired of these fighters ducking one another fight the best to be the best.
The fuxking gun comment... omg y u kill the mood. We all damn well know he didn't mean no harm
Lol I knew that boii wasn’t ready
Lets stay away from the gums
Well we ain't the the ones doing the unnecessary shooting so let the man use his example 🙄  always wanna say sunnin slick when its your kind that have the majority of seats and control of legislation that could possibly make a change .....#aint no safety on this Glock!!!!
props to rolly
Petition to fire jim grey  he always with the bs
Showtime y’all need to fire Jim Grey man for real
Congratulations tank
Humble humble humble. I respect the champ. Thanks Tank. GTD all the way..
He will be able to fight again in 90 days. 🤣😂🤣😂
He mentioned Pacquiao on that punch.. 👊👊👊
You’re an humble person tank 👍 congratulation on your success.
congratulations, humble for a boxer
Your humility is amazing brother! Love your vibe man! First you thanked God! That’s it bro!
haha boring fighter 😅😅😅👎👎👎
Had that boy doing the merengue 💃😂😂
#GervontaDavis proved his a true champion, humble wins over cockiness. Showing true sportsmanship & acknowledge your opponent, that's classy.
now that he gives revenge to pitbull Cruz
Well we ain't the the ones doing the unnecessary shooting so let the man use his example 🙄  always wanna say sunnin slick when its your kind that have the majority of seats and control of legislation that could possibly make a change .....#aint no safety on this Glock!!!!
Way to go tank stay blessed ✝️ enjoy your family time....
Put some respect on my Mexican pitbull
Lets go people who thought rolly would win must be 😓
It more like a shotgun tank  Boom 💥 KO 😆 Congratulations 👏 Tank Bad Dude 😎
What a POS announcer! IDGAF! Guns save lives💪
Pacquiao moves
Davis vs Haney next.
the ref is bought out.... WOW 😳
panalo na naman c bayabas pala
Jim grey stfu with that gun shit. Hes a fighter not a politician.
That al Gray or whatever his name is, he a racist basterd and they Ned to replace him, we blacks read all threw his coded speeches.
Yeah I was kinda baffed by the power on that one, the young clip looked light, but my man's body reacted like an Xbox 360 Elite power button 😅
Tank is incredible.
Gervonta davis is getting more better when he speak..Floyd Mayweather is good
Tank is so patient with his counters.
that Bum was put in the dirt! another way of saying  from Spence..
Truthfully Rolly had no business getting in the ring with Tank it's like Tank tried to tell him, we aren't on the same level. Rolly believed because he didn't start boxing until he was 17 and didn't have many fights to put him where he was equalled he must be a great fighter. From what I saw the fight he had where his opponent got robbed by a bad decision of the win it told me that Rolly was being protected. We all know Rolly's real advantage is his ability to make weight then rehydrate back to his actual weight which is what actually makes him bigger and stronger than his opponents. Teofimo had the same ability. The bigger stronger guy is  expected to win against all smaller man that's why they have weight classes. Only a bully blowhard would brag they beat up people smaller than them.  Hopefully Rolly is ok and he learned the lesson about respect and humility Tank came to teach him.  Tank is the real deal and a Great Champion!!!
Just like rolly got his tank will get his there is always someone better but great fight
give the rematch to pitbull cruz dude, lets see a show
Out of curiosity after a while what happens to a boxers speech when taking to many blows to the head.?
you know what I just became a tank fan , very respectful skillful and honest fighter .
Jim Gray needs to get put in his place! He always try’s to tell grown man 👨 what not to say. The dude has liberal written all over his face… Bring Adrien Broner back he always gave him a hard time…
After he made the gun comment, you can see the guy in the back coaching him on what to say
Stupid liberal demoncrats, always making something political and trying to destroy our constitution! I got news for ya! Real news. This is America and it's our constitutional right MF! How about joe and the deep state stole our election and got caught! Make your little comment on that! Oh I forgot they didn't pay you to make a remark that don't fit their new world order narrative! 🙇! Stupid AZZ!
Tank has a big head it's gonna be target practice smh 🤣😂
“ lets not talk about guns” guns dont kill people, people kill people.
I know ad I understand a school just got shoot up but bro why try ad be like tank stay away from gun like he’s the one who shoot the school up
Can't stand those snakes that do interviews
Yeah,. Maybe if he said these cannons.  But, he definitely didn't mean it in that way
Tank Ko rolly the same exact way Floyd Ko Ricky Hatton. He lured rolly to the corner and timed Him with a left hook
True champion
Everybody knew what he meant when he said “Ain’t no safety on this glock”  No disrespect to anyone who has lost members this year.
Just to be honest im on Tanks side but all in all its a horrible mistake on the referee side. Rolly got up on the 8 second it was too early and a horrible decision on the referee part. I know people are ganna disagree with me but i always say the truth its the referees fault  and a horrible decision.
“Ain’t no safety on this glocc” talk to shi my boy lol
Soft chin
I think you had to fight with   Cruz Pitbull I know you scared about this guy go ahead fight with he
Rolli rolled right into the ropes. With the stanky legs and knees buckling. 😭
When he brought up that Manny and Marquez comment, that was the exact thought I had. I'm glad he recognized it, but that goes to show, a careless offense, can be beat by a good enough single defensive punch.
Luv it man. The safety is off the Glock and I got plenty of ammo😎. Sttraight Savage. Would love to C Tank vs Lomo👍🏿
Wtf dude!?!? Like nobody was thinking about the tragedy that just took place when he made the glock reference. Another case of the interviewer trying to steal the spot light and making it about something they said. What a shame SMH
What a humble honourable Champion!,  and a big F-U to the interviewer for politicizing and projecting on his moment…Go back to house of privilege
In boxing the smarter fighter always wins rolly could have won but he got too reckless. Good stoppage rolly can learn from this and learn to think and relax he has good power and potential but too damm aggressive style. Gervonta played it smart and attack when the timing was right. Respect ✊🏼
The Ref was paid! The whole time he was looking for an excuse to stop the fight for Tank. Rolls won all but one round, he deserved to keep going to prove what he was all about.
Hey buddy let the man say what ever he wants! If you don't know kids get killed all day by guns in other countries and nobody mourning about that...smh
Gosh dang he’s humble love to see this younging reaching new milestones 🤧🍻🍻🍻
Tank is arguably the Top Gun in boxing. He's got it all and keeps adding to his Resume. No way Ryan Garcia gets in the ring with him.
Boo Romero talking all that bs .....out like 💡
Yeah I’m not gonna lie dude need to be checked after that he ain’t have to say nothing about the gun thing Tank has said it before man weird asf for that. He really Built like sucked a on tic tac, lil paper body ahh. Also Our Nations been in difficult times so what was your point in bringing that up at a positive moment weirdo. I’m sorry but bruh need to be fired 😭 man look like he play with pencil sharpeners and chew on the wood 🪵
Tank is pure class 4real “Ain’t no safety in this Glock!!”
Dum axxss rolly fans lol
The real life "One punch Man" congrats tank
I just got home from the fight! New York Get the money 🔥
Racist Jim Gray talking about what he shouldn't say..pleez..it ain't Tank fault that yte boys go Awol and wanna mass target the place
The Guy with the mic should have shut his mouth with that gun comment! Dont ruin this champions moment with all that.. come on now...
2:34 what he said? I didn't understand the last word he said
Jim grey is a buzzkill
Yo Romero is a str8 bum
Well said & handled GTD THE ONE SILVER BACK your patients timing & that counter science of boxing hit Move don't get hit with that technic behind your power
Jim Gray sounded ridiculous with that mainstream media puppet comment about "lets stay away from guns..." .  They really are trying too hard to get the American public to hate guns, hate the 2nd amendment , and willingly disarm ourselves. Go check how that worked out in nazi Germany and any other society that was disarmed. It works out horrificly.Dont fall for the propaganda.
As much as Tank wanted to be cocky and rub it in.  He thanked Rolly and Rolly Team for helping build the fight with all that trash talk.   I'm glad the ref Saved Rolly with that Tko, but I wanted Tank to get his "Finish Him" moment in. And get his Flawless Victory KO, oh well... Maybe next time
Jim Gray always gotta be the center of attention. Tank should’ve told him to STFU!
Don't even shout-out the Texas victims.....sad
Good job  TANK !!MEGA KO
He did not just say he ain’t that strong with that red bump on yo forehead
Rolly ran into a tank now where yall weak az. Rolly fans at🤣
We no
Where all the Rolly fans at? The fight was beautiful. Until the ref wouldn't let Rolly go again. But it's all good not!!!!! Barely touched him, like he touched him on the stage
Tank is growing up. God be with him, keep him. Hope he makes wise choices and show his talent at the highest levels. I’ve always known that in that sub 147 vicinity, Tank, Shakur, and Devin would be the last guys standing.
If you knew he was saying the gun statement in terms of boxing, why then did you have to make him feel embarrassed
what a humble monster😂
Tank answered the questions with humbleness! Way to do it right ! Great win 🏅 congratulations 🎉
Tank and Rolly both won tonight along with promoters and everyone on the collecting end. The only ones who lost was those who bought the fight and played into the propaganda. Sports entertainment at it's best! LOL! Tank said it best, all that drama was to promote the fight nothing else. At 2.39 of the 6th round tank got his 25th KO. 239 is the 52nd  prime number which is 25 backwards.  Was this predictable? Hmmm!
UR PUNCHES IS VERRY ACCURATE
Man please get outta your feminine feels, the man was not in any kind of way referring to guns in that way, this chump was just that, a chump for even saying that. I guarantee you he voted for bi(D)en.
Browns Mexicans and native Americans 12 tribes of Israel we are God chosen people the real Hebrew Israelites of the earth we are the real Jews repent 123
i thought i hated this guy
UR CONCENTRATION IS SERIOUS
Why did he have to comment about the gun he could tell the line between that
Referee killed this fight.
“ im  gunna knock tank Davis the fuck out”, Rolly Romero
#teamrolly
They both made millions 💰💰💰💵
That was way too early stoppage romero was back up the ref was on tanks side for sure the whole fight, tryna throw off romero by complaining about his actions kinda sad how boxing is rigged they just set up on main guy to win.
He didn’t even have to set him up. Just pure skill and discipline. That knockout punch was just a reflex.
Wide swings like that  from far back show the lack of experience from Rolly.
This man really said "let's stay away from guns, this is a horrible time in our nation." 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️ Tf
Wow....................Tank is a man and his words reflect that. Great job, Tank.
Tank is DAVID knocking out all Goliath I believe in you
Tank has always a unpredictable shot k.o...
Lomo destroys both of these guys. In my opinion, this was a terrible fight. I didn't see anything from either guy that was substantial boxing wise. Shukur beats Davis easy. Kamboso I think does also. Haney probably gets a w by just boxing well. Garcia? Haven't seen enough of him. But based on this performance, I don't see a good boxer having a lot of trouble with Davis. Rolly was tailored made for him. Another puncher with less boxing skills. Lomo beats all of them.
Damn, Jim! Having a good interview and you just had to bring up that 💩 when Tank's metaphor actually fit well with how he was responding to your question!! Cornball for mentioning that👎
Tanks patience and IQ is crazy. Rolly is just awkward which made it a little difficult. Tank played it smart and set him up.
Tank has the unique ability to see opportunity while under pressure and getting hit. That's how he knocks his opponents out and why the scorecards oftetimes don't matter in his fights
WHY JIM LAMPLEY ALWAYS GOTTA RUIN SHIT YOU KNEW WHAT TANK MEANT TALKING BOUT “THIS IS NO TIME TO TALK ABOUT GUNS” BOI IF YOU DONT GET YO BOWLING BALL HEADASS ON SOMEWHERE!!
No harm no foul Tank, we no you meant that figuratively. Dude has matured a lot since he started boxing. Biggup on your win brother!!!!
Tank the best in the game right now.
Isaac Cruz, rematch
He talking about boxing so don't turn the interview into something it wasn't , they also trying to make my brothers look bad when they on top looking good, Floyd fell for it, but good job tank throwing his shade to the back of your mind, ain't no safety on this keyboard I'll keep typing plenty of ammo, everyone mind was elsewhere then u bring it up NVM
He forgot to asked tank about his hand?
Looks like Romero will be at the top of the list in the next video” when trash talk goes wrong”
Love You Tank Davis & shout out to Smooth Talking Calvin Ford
Kambosas Davis 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Tank is a Tank! Congrats bro!
Hipor que no leda larebancha apibur cru ese gorpe erselodio apibur bariabese hi selo aguantó es poreso k no leda.larechancha estabe sipelean nuevamente lo no kpibur
Lampley is outta pocket
Good job kid 💲👍👍👍👍👍💗👍
I just do not like that man doing the interviews after fights. He's just rude really. Just my thoughts.
No Rolly was winning the fight comments...lol
“Ain’t no safety on this glock, you know” I like tank bro😂💯
was coach bullet annoying anyone else this fight? lol
Stay away from guns??? Wow!! Fucking creep!
I don’t like when him and Merchant be trying to tell fighters what to say
This is one of the most intelligent, honest post-fight interviews I have ever  seen.  What a man.
What turned me off about this fight was when Rolly was fighting dirty. That was not necessary. Tank was a better man and a humble one as well.
funny how the guy interviewing tank doesnt realize that in baltimore city there are mass shootings weekly not once in a while.
Looks like a totally transformed young man…  Humility won out tonight…  Thank you Tank for avenging Jackson MARIÑES’ loss…  Robando Romero is now 13-2
This is a real Sportsman Tank ur still growing 🇬🇾 😍 🥊 💯
All the big mouths go down.danny Garcia Lopez .
They’re tryna make it more dramatic than it already is, asking questions to press more drama between the two fighters
the growth of tank is amazing
200k easy thanks Tank
Lara vs Charlo would make for quite an exciting fight.
Jim Gray making Davis realize his Glock comment wasn’t in good taste during the interview.
Stay humble tank. Your a good dude
He just watched this man violently K.O another human in front of thousands as a relic to the gore glory sport age and he’s conceded about his Glock analogy. TANK IS A PRO FIGHTER NOT BARACK OBAMA.
. Telling Davis to watch what you say when speaking about guns. How pathetic was that. Freedom of speech baby. People died for it show it some respect.
This old dude is ret... why would you bring up the tragedy?
Leonard Ellerbe look disappointed when Tank Davis got the knockout so I can imagine with Floyd Mayweather Jr look like along with his promotion company. Tank Davis defeated them all. Great job Tank.
*TANK CANT SAY GLOCK BUT THE NRA STILL HAD A CONVENTION IN TEXAS DAYS AFTER THE SCHOOL TRAGEDY...🙄MEANWHILE IMAGINE BEING NAMED ROLLY AND THEN GET  ROLL'D UP 😆*
World class champion! 🤜🏾♥️🤛🏾
Boy got a Alligator mouth and a humming bird ass... Mouth write checks that ya ass can't cash
What a class act for such a young man! He will last very humble.
Scared punches do that. Kid ran and he will get hurt if he fights Teofimo or Shakur.
Sure bro. Cruz wants all that smoke . Run it back if u a real G"
Tank just landed that punch so perfectly that it didn’t have to be that hard especially when Rolly walked into it.   Props to Rolly though, I honestly expected him to be far more reckless and stupid but He definitely played smart at first, but he messed up and got caught.   Wish the fight could have kept going but it is what it is.  Descent fight.
Disappointment
Low IQ reporter bringing up the Texas shooting at the end, its boxing buddy.
Me: Tank you don't wanna throw that hard. It's a Counter punch. The impact was doubled already.
That’s when you realise there’s levels to this game
The guy basically ran the whole fight like wtf he acting like he did anything lol.
Coach Calvin You Did It Again !!!!! Proud Of The Both Of You All .... I'm Smiling From Ear To Ear
Tank is coming into man hood he is groom very well by his team and coach calvin . Respect to Tank he is trully a beast
When you have 25/27 KOs you find a way to do a lot of them without throwing full force. Davis has incredible Boxing IQ, his insane power is a bonus.
Please get someone new to interview.. he made a Glock reference and this man made it real awkward over nothing.
I didn't know Mr. Russell passed away. 😥🙏
My man tank.
Ain't no safety on this Glock🥊🥊🥊🥊
tank won but  i think its stupid to say he carried Rolly..Tank took a measured approach cause if he tried to look for the KO he would of been playing into Rolly's hands..Tank knew not to underestimate the guy..Rolly lost because of just inexperience, plain and simple..no way gervonta could do that against Haney or Kambosos..
Jim Gray is always trying to tell people how to interview. POS.
Rolly left the ring immediately as a scared chump! What no interviews ??? Crying in the locker room with his coach.
Pit bull Cruz got robbed
I swear to God I just want to punch the crap out of the man who Interview tank at end of the fight He’s like oh please don’t said that
Romero was talkin' so much shit, he has to retire at this point.
The place I was watching the fight at reaction was priceless crowd just erupted
before round 3 or 4 I literally heard Rolly corner say “keep going, put on a show” and said yeah he bout to get knocked out soon. Rolly kept throwing the same wild punches and Tank capitalized 🤷🏽‍♂️
Thats yall with them crazy shooting ass weirdos
Great win now tank needs to fight some better competition
Tank vs Loma please!
Rolly his hard tank has a lump on his head if he sharpens his skill he can be a problem
WE ARE GLOCKS WITH A LOT OF AMMUNITION!  ANY IDEA WHO HELPED MAKE US THIS WAY! HMMMNNNNN?
Stevenson is too smart for Tank he’s going to beat him 9 rounds to 3 easy
expected him to win tbf
tank vs pitbull 2
Jim grey your so rude!!!!!
I already knew tank was gonna beat him I didn’t watch this fight!
Y’all need to give this man respect y’all wanna see him loose so bad
Tank's a True Man and expressed himself like a true Champ a Pro and a Gentleman
Tank is the real deal at 135
I thought Romero would win by points. He’s hard puncher but Left Counterpunch made him humble by Tank. Congrats
Who else dislikes this reporter 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
Tank has Matured so much.  I’m loving it. We’re all the Rolly fan boys who had so much to say at now
Fairplay to tank did this bizz again and put cocky rolly rite in his place he was calm cool and callected wairted to catch him and he didnt hit him as hard as he cud ov so hes got gud skills an power he guna take sum stopping but no time soon!! Wish him all the best from bidzy westmids gypsey england!!
Jim Gray get on my fuckin nerves...he is a racist Nd hates to see black champions...Tank vs Shakur 🔥
POW right in the kisser 😂😂😂😂
I'm glad that Mayweather is not there talking about how great he was.
He's a class act 👏🏾👏🏾 humble is the way
Pitbull will get a rematch
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
When trash talking goes wrong. God word true haughtiness comes before a fall. Lord help.this young man. Be Jesus champion. Shining bright for future generations.
As time went on he has been acting like a true champion. Beast mode maintained
Man jum whack for that. You said it yourself, "I know you didn't mean it like that." Guns aren't bad, ppl are. Stop it. If I'm tank, he cannot interview me ANYMORE!
Stfu he was talking bout his hands as a gun and u wanna take it there with negativity smh
Bruh I'm keep telling everybody this guy is amazing 👏  I'm latino but that doest stop me from appreciating Davis' skills. He is absolutely amazing. Hopefully he is big enough to move up. Congratulations brother, keep the good work. Davis, Canelo, Charlo(154), Fury and Spence are without a doubt the most entertaining fighters of this generations 👏👌🙌 that's why a bunch of us don't hesitate to buy your ppvs. Amazing!!!!!
Man tank is so respected! Conversation champ!
The reporter on some bullshit tank just keeping hood Tank beast mode
He is not Tank anymore he is a GLOCK 😎😅👍
Jim grey the fuckin worst
Another top 10 cocky fighter got destroyed.
No safety lol tank wild .🤦‍♂️. That old man ain’t had to do tank like that. Straight clown for dat.
How about davis vs loma next? Will be fun 💯
Tank is skilled no doubt, but its time to face the top guys. For someone as good as him to have a pretty ordinary resume is unacceptable! His next fight should be against either the winner of haney/Kambosos, or Lomachenko, anyone else would be a cherry in my opinion!
Well he did say this fight  going to be fireworks 🎇 lol 😆 😂😂
Did the old ass white guy box before? He dosent deserve to be there in my opinion
Tank is a class act definitely my fav boxer unlike canelo who I greatly dislike salud desde mexico
Loma next!
gentleman he even said Mayweather and prolly 🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾
WHERE THE ROLLIE FANBOYS AT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE POWER 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Let's not talk about guns....."  That shit was lame as hell.  Made it into something it wasn't.
This was expected.
Rolly on the ground Romero  NO SAFETY ON THIS GLOCK - GTD 🥊
😬😅😈🥊🥋🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 la Mb de Tijuana El 😈😈😈😈🇲🇽😃👌☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️
I respect what he just said.
It does look like that Marquez's KO against Pacquiao
Loma vs tank needs to happen. Great win by tank and great efforts to Rollie
Humble GTD, congratulations on your K.O victory!
way to go tank
I see loma is the hardest fight for tank
I think jake  paul can beat Romeo ass too
I don't like the old guy because he stands there like he really dosent like to be there , he looks nervous and frantic
Is it just me or did Tank have a bit of a stutter and trouble making out words?
Outstanding young man... STAND UP B MO CAREFUL... I love you tank 🤎👊🏽💪🏾💯
MY CONGRATS TANK.. KEEP SHOWING THE WORLD WHAT IT TAKES TO B ONE OF THE BEST..  GONZALEZ FAM SEND LOVE N RESPECT. FROM DALLAS.
Congratulations champ
Damn he took a good elbow
He did the crazy legs. 🤣 Lmao... 🥊👍🏿
Tank was Losing the Fight. He was behind On Points. Romero Just ran into a left hand. Romero Fought A Good Fight. Congratulations To Davis. Good Champion. Good sportsmanship on His part. I rooted for Romero But Congratulations to G.T.Davis 👍
that wasnt even maximum power from tank, rolly wouldve went to sleep on the canvas
Old white guy needs to be fired
All the hype
He trying to take my boy joy about the gun 🔫 comment man let that man enjoy and say what he say
Tank won a new fan, didn’t know he had class too
That was funny ass fight !! Rolly ain't going to be driving a Mitsubishi no more tomorrow is going to be driving a McLaren lol
Like Manny Pacquiao tactics 👊☝️
Yes
White ass commentator can't stand him 😤  1st you ask loaded questions and then trys to get the man to say something awkward then with a smug ass attitude corrects the person . Get his old ass off the interviews after the fight !
Those teeth
“He’s a dumbass fighter” -Gervonta “TANK” Davis
Tank is a problem for anybody he's grown and mature soooo much
Idk tank was losing the last two fights but won by ko
Did anyone hear the sound of that punch? Tank nearly took my heart away 🙌❤️🙌
This young man raised right he didn't take offense to old man saying let's not bring up Guns as it bad time sad time for America right now. Tank face you could see that he was humble n didn't mean no harm and spoke with better care
TANK IS INCREDIBLE 🔥🔥🔥...SAY LESS
Solid KO and I liked the humble interview but I didn't like that he didn't call out some specific names he wants next! It's time to get serious!
He carried rolly the entire fight 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I fk with Tank, much respect
A different tank from a couple years ago I like his growth I’m officially a fan
Safety on them Glock ☝️☝️☝️☝️
Rolly aka “Sometimes you write a check with your mouth, that your as$ can’t cash!” - An Old Black Proverb 🤣🤣🤣
Tank was having a great interview until…….
Respect to Tank for still thanking rolly and team , man that’s a true champion.
That’s how it’s done #1 pound for pound material right there 🙏💪
Baltimore's Finest!!@ Salute King!!!
That’s a BADD MANN 👊🏾
Tank is true champion
Imagine if Rolly win...
Jim Grey most boring interviewers!!!!!!  #RETIREALREADY
Hey Rolly... Don't Eff with the DMV. Bout Dat Tank🥊 life. BMore don't play
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph! If it wasn’t for the ropes, Rolly would’ve landed on top of the judges table 😮
Romero got cooked and burned
I feel sorry for Tank because he clearly comes from humble chaotic beginnings where he doesn’t seem to know right from wrong even as an adult. The adults around him seem to be no good either and just as ignorant. Just a bunch of goons who try as they may have no morals or scruples. I just hope Al Hayman can get a grip of this young man and his people or put someone in charge of the out of the ring stuff. Clearly they know what they are doing inside the ring but it’s the outside stuff that needs sorting. How can anyone not know that making gun references and gestures isn’t the right thing to do, but evidently Tank and his corner don’t know that. So if they don’t know obvious stuff like that how do they cope with the more complicated stuff in life?
Tank Baltimore and NY got your back. Rollie got embarrassed, that’s why he didn’t do the press conference after 🤫🤫
Well deserved young man✊🏾
REAL ONE
The interviewer could have skipped over instead of pointing out the glock part.
Pit bull nextrematch
Shakur Stevenson is the fight I want to see next!
Way to ruin tanks moment, this was tank's moment man
tank you are the man big love brother
With all that antics, I think Tank is a good guy overall.
Who is Jim Grey to tell the champion of the world what he can and cannot talk about? This is the United States of America, if you’re offended by firearms, you may want to consider interviewing fighters elsewhere in the world. What a joke. And does it so smug, as if he’s reprimanding Tank like a child. Watched Lederman do this to fighters his entire career, not just Mayweather.
Early stoppage, ref was against Rolly and for people saying it was right stoppage and he should not give him chance go watch Fury Wilder 1
Tank is a beast in lightweight division😈 He will destroy Garcia, Lopez, Haney and maybe even Lomachenko🤷🏻‍♂️
TOOO BLACK TOOO STRONG 💪🏿
Rolly stated pre-fight that Tank csnt fight going backwards. Never underestimate your opponent.
Not giving up my guns , people kill people not guns, were going to ban knives too?
Rolly built this fight up
Tank is a Class Act!! Beautiful 🤩 knock out Congrats Tank
The dwarf slayer have been slayed 😍 🙌
Tank really matured...
Whoever thought rolly would've won this was out of his mind lmfao
Rolly might just need a new coach tbh , rolly has potential win lose or draw he young Nd still learning Nd no lie knows how to sell a fight Nd it was a good fight while it lasted you gotta respect rolly Nd hopefully rolly Nd tank can squash the bs Nd rep TMT together the right way 💯
Fucking announcer not to talk about guns why even bring it up
Whenever you walk into a punch it always 6xxxxxxx times worse
His nose came off. Lmao... 🥊👍🏿💪🏿
pitbull!!
Roelly talks the talk, but Tank walks the walk...Ref should have let the fight go so Tank could have dogged on the boy, cause you know the Roelly fan boys will say the fight was stopped to early. SMH. Tank was playing with that boy!
TANK HITS DIFFERENT!!! WE DEW WHAT WE DEW!!!!
My man tank👍🏿🥊💪🏿
Why he get a couple of boos' when he thanked his believer, this America freedom of religion
I am profoundly sorry for the families of those children needlessly murdered in Texas.
Next step for Tank is real competition: Shakur Stevens, the winner of Haney v Kambosos, Ryan Garcia, Teo or Loma...It's time to crown an undisputed in the light weight division after an elite showdown!
I knew tank was gone catch him by then faints

Jim gray was dumb for saying that!!! It has nothing to do with tank he just killed the vibe
jim gray is so bad smh
Jim Gray trying to start trouble Rollie did what he was supposed to do which is sold the fight. Millions of ppl watched this fight to either root for Rollie or to see him get slept and he delivered lol

Man rollie had them noodle legs 🦵 😳 😭 😂
He threw 25 punches 😂😂😂 that how you know he ain’t fake son seriously
Lucky punch....rolly was winning
I told you GARVONTA will fuck up rolly
Tank davis got my respect for saying thank god first..👍🏼
Leonard Ellerbe looks low-key upset! probably banked on Rolly considering Tank might leave
If tank don't say and everything like that I don't feel it
Tank! 🥊🥊🥊🥊☝️☝️☝️👍💪💪💪🏆 tank is a beast .little canelo and Tyson.
Love from uk 🇬🇧 what a warrior
God didn’t do anything
All I wanna know is where are all the stupid mf’s who picked Rolly to win?! Huh?! Where y’all at?! 😳
I’m so glad he knocked this clown out, u can sell tickets with all that shit talking but u gotta be able to back it up in the rind and to not have the sportsmanship to stay in the ring after he got knocked out lol
Premature stoppage against a fighter with an injured ankle.
Um uh.. let’s stay away from guns. lol of course he wasn’t being disrespectful and I’m sure no one was even thinking about the situation in Texas until the narrator bought it up 🤦‍♂️ hope to see tank vs George
Tank the best ppv fighter. Humble and  a monster
Boring fight always runing🤣🤣🤣
Rolly a Bitch I knew Tank Davis was gonna knock him out
*The crazy thing is if Rolly had more experience he actually might have won this fight. 🤷🏽‍♂️*
ROLLY pack up and get the fuck out of Boxing
Tank didn’t just knock him out. He set up the KO.
Jim Gray, you didn’t have to say that bro 😬😬 made it way more awkward
I look at Gervonta's drug attic mother and brother and Gervonta's little tattooed face and body and I have to ask myself why would God bless these degenerates?
WHOS NEXT?????.....
What happened to that Boy!🤣  Told you, 6th round TKO
Rolly has terrible sportsmanship for not even talking to the reporters when you were the one that was doing the most talking. Bad look for him going forward this will be his biggest moment in his career getting knocked tf out tanks stage.
HANEY OR KAMBOSOS NEXT CANT WAIT FOR ALL THE MARBLES
Luv this kid… stay humble and ready to rumble
✊🏿🔥✊🏿🔥✊🏿🔥✊🏿🔥✊🏿🔥✊🏿🔥✊🏿🔥✊🏿🔥✊🏿
Rolley dookie🙈
He got to comfortable and look what happened he had a better chance chilling taking his time like Tank🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
That announcer totally bitched out on guns at the end of that video. He’s the problem with this nation!
Gervonta Davis cheated 🤡  He had egg weights🥚in his gloves🥊 Rolly's trainer spied his water🧴 Tank also paid off the Ref 👨🏾‍💼  Rolly was winning the fight 🏆  Tank Davis is a bum who can't fight🗑️🚮
Tank - "I've got plenty ammunition"  Elementary schools - 😅😅😅
🇸🇳👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👂🏽❤️❤️❤️❤️💴💴💴💴💴💴💴💴🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
TANK DAVIS 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
it was completely unnecessary for him to make the glock statement a whole ordeal. no need to connect that to the shootings. i woulda ended the interview right there
Rollie skidaddled TF outta there. He went from 🥴 to 🛏️ to🏃🏾‍♂️🏃🏾‍♂️🏃🏾‍♂️🏃🏾‍♂️ 😅😂🤣🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍
Tank should stay away from the top dogs in Loma/Haney/Kambosos and most definitely Shakur Stevenson.
All that damn talking Rolley did!! 🤣🤣🤣 He found out why they call him Tank…And Tank said “I didn’t even throw it hard!!”#DAMN!!
Tank is a real champion. Such a class act, and an incredibly skilled and smart fighter. Respect for keeping it humble through all this drama the past month or so
Rolly got his big mouth shut 🥊
Truly humble and respectful in victory. Another amazingly awesome win by Gervonta Tank Davis. Honestly it’s still shocking how much heart was shown by Mario Barrios against Gervonta Davis that nobody even came close Rolly got humbled. The Tank vs Barrios that bout will forever be a masterpiece in Boxing history by humble champions with great willpower. Congrats Gervonta on another great well earned win indeed God is the Greatest of them all.
ALL THE DIXK RIDERS AND HATERS KNOCKED YO OUT AND OUT OF ALL OF THAT GAVE THE KID RESPECT BALTIMORE SHIT BABY 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥💯
Tank 💯
Jim was out of context wit dat Texas shooting reference 🤦🏽‍♂️
Let him fight some actual competition
KO ROMERO I see he got a big mouth n ALOT OF HEART  Salute both of these men 🥊
Pit bull cruz made him change styles, Tank is getting old and hasn’t fought anyone good
Wowwww

Tank vs canelo.. make it happen 💯
Congrats tank..
Rolly was doing okay until he started getting reckless .

Damn imagine what happens when he does throw hard!!!
He kinda killed Tank’s vibe with that gun comment. That was unnecessary
Can’t talk about guns during this time😂
