Goldbridge is a massive voice he has the biggest united channel, his own radio show and a lot of contacts on other channels
15:38 - who are we thinking this player is?
Complains about leaks from the club, then says he had inside info on a player who thinks he's made it. You couldn't make it up seriously
Is it ETG or the board panic buy
The Saudi prince M.B.S wanted to buy Man U would have been the perfect owner he’s Rich enough to pay the asking price
Never rated  Rabiot would rather play one of the youngsters Garner's the obvious option he can't do any worse than Fred so why not play him?
£100 million....Anthony and Laimer. It is soooo bloody obvious!!!!
LISTEN to this. I know I need to move on with the Now. But….. Keane, scholes, Beckham and Giggs 😭😭😭 I miss these players so much
What I would do to have prime Roy Keane and Paul Scholes. Hands down in my opinion the best two midfield players as a duo best in world. Ineista and Xavi next duo I just loved Keane mentality and scholes was just something very special
Always believed Ten Haag is a strong coach , but seeing what the board is doing and defending them. It makes me realize he’s another Solksjær with better CV.
Knighton and The Consortium out!!!
I wonder if Sir Bobby charlton is dusting off his boots or why don't we get Zlatan back or Ruud or Rooney I'm sure they'd do better than this shower of shite, What a joke this club has become and I'm seriously thinking about jumping ship and support some other team with more ambition like wigan or Accrington Stanley somewhere I don't expect anyrhing from them....wait a minute I'll stick with United than.
U never know Mark. ETH first Presser on Ragnick:  "Thats on the clup(B)..."
wheather i like all ur opinions or not i always watch as i know u thoughts are based on whats best for the club, and sometimes people are scared to call certain people out because the lose credentials etc but i respect ur always urself
I really would like to see Tonali at Arsenal great player and I wonder how he would do in the prem. For me he would be the transfer of the window, great player for his age
I agree with a previous comment: It is becoming a good time to splash on Rice. Get Declan! We need a proper captain and CDM!
Ragnic was shitest manager we had stats don't lie
de gea dalot  varane  martinez  malacia FDJ  VDB sancho  fernandes  rashford ronaldo  This eleven can get top 4. FDJ needs to come in
Can't believe in past three years we let go player like Ander Herrera Pogba Matic Mata go for free
United.T.I.D❣🖤🧣 I wish my team all the best..... mark Goldbridge is so right let's heal as a club let's come together... we are on crutches just now.?? but keep the faith we Manchester utd!!!! are a massive club & we will  be back competing at the top again we need to build for the future & its difficult to bring in the right quality of players when we can't offer them champs league football so who do we buy?? who will improve us?? as a team.. & can integrate as part of the new man utd team transformation?? Give E.T.H time as we need a massive overhaul... players need to realise they are being paid massive amounts££€€€ every week win draw or loose? Either play for the club or don't  & go?? A non premadonna approach is what some of these over paid players need a reality  check that know one!!! Is bigger than the club........ ⚽️❣🖤🧣
Why don't united get our shite barkley hudson oido  loftus creek  jouginio  basyhte  haverz  mount  all for 50 quid  solves all your problems
How would palace get 40m? Are you alright?
Dw about walk out just dont walk in lol
arnautovic would give us 10+ goals this season. so...if ronaldo is here this season it would be 20 + 10 and we need that! who else score 10 goals?? marco is a monster if he gets the right passes!!
Here to keep an eye on Hag😎
It is very sad that United might not be able to get De Jong
Reactive rather than proactive management. No planning, no vision and no future.
❤️💯
Within the next 4 games you will see martinez playing DM mark my words and he will do it well.
So you want the Glazers out but you don't want to do absolutely anything to make that happen? Interesting logic, no commitment you're just like those prats who played at the weekend just worrying about your pocket, your t-shirt sales and your members list....
the downfall of our club starts when the salvage players were bought from chelsea.
de jong as gone to chelsea what a waste of time we have spent on this signing
United fans are an absolute embarrassment! Fans of other clubs would never let this happen!
Glazers out
The fanbase is divided so it's impossible to change anything. What a terrible attitude Mark.
If you don't sell Rashford now then for sure this club will go down
Any disruption is better than bon cause its cause the glazers too take notice and think
Diversity is strength. Whether you like all the people involved or not, diversity allows all of our strengths to come to the fore in order to push for ideas that could actually be solutions.
Well sad too say there wont be any uniting off any fans groups. So preparer fir the status quos
Smh. You come in this channel sometimes and act like you are talking to your kids.
I backed ETH when he made Maguire captain. I’m starting to think he made the wrong decision now. I’m gonna struggle to not be ETH out if he starts McFred again😤
I am fed up with who we are going to get in the transfer window
But they aren’t selling the club mark so they can’t have loads of buyers
we need two of them Jeremy Doku, Rafael Santos Borre, Viktor Tsygankov, Ben Yedder
Wtf they on about ronaldo put a sitter on rashfords plate and he hit right at keeper and if was other way round ronaldo scores
NOBODY wants to play for UTD..i mean wtf !!
Trust ten haag
FREE LAGER FOR ALL
Christensen and Kessie could leave Barcelona for free if they are not registered before Saturday, sources have confirmed to ESPN. Opportunity for a CB and a CDM. Just pay the wages and signing on fee and you are sorted!
Mark looking handsome today
New stadium is not needed it's wanted
Even Everton are buy players
A man united all or nothing would be pure tv gold
As stupid as it seems could we not play Phil Jones as a cdm,also is it time to bin rashford ?
2-0 without Ronaldo (1Half)...2-1 with Ronaldo (2nd Half)..😅...Leaking from dressing room is because there is no leader..nothing but just bunch of players act like stars players just only because they are playing in the big club..what they good were blamed to each other and throwing the manager from the bus in the last 5 years...instead of looking them self infront of the mirror..and said..what had I given for this club interm of performance week and week out season after season ?
De Jong to Chelsea.
Great channel.
t
So tired of the negativity, united were my safe place, my happiness. Now we are a joke and in constant chaos. We need to safe this beautiful club.
We can get kessie
Juranovic from celtic is a smart move ,,,turns up in the big games
Enough is enough guys, Brighton lost Bissouma and Cucurella and still beat us, at old trafford with ten Hag having his first game. It's time now time to show up with the norwich scarfs when we play liverpool. Who is with me?
Takeover doesn't take that long. If and a big if we get someone it can happen this season. Yes it would be hard but it can happen.  I think you're right tho, we need to all unite. Do this protests consistently
Goldbridge talking out his arse again. Football fans don't make football teams great! Owners and managers do. Sir Matt Busby! Sir Alex! What if he had gone to Newcastle? City don't have any fans and look at them now. The better the team becomes the larger the fanbase become. They don't have to get along.
United is like an aircraft carrier, it's very hard to get it to turn. But if change skipper, you can finally get improvements. Fans have to demand it. But the Glazors time is over.
Next: Andy Carroll to United
"Javier Hernandez said he would play for Man United for free if the club came calling." Even if he is not good enough to start for us as a 34-year old player, he would definitely be a great squad player. I want Chicharito back!!! Press the like button to make an impact on the club's transfer strategy again!!!
ETH was overconfident about FDJ deal, overconfident about the squad and overconfident of selecting the right players. That’s why no summer transfer. Richard Arnold has already said what you said like a month ago.
Mark Eric Bailly was blamed for licking information, now he has been sold but yet licks have still continued. I think rashford is licking information to the press , because he was critisized by Roi kean.
If we keep performing like what was served up vs Brighton....eventually fans will start to not turn up...the cost etc for really poor performances...I wonder what the attendances have been like for the last 50 homes games...compared to the previous 50 🤔
There is no panic spend here, eric is still analyzing players. Now he knows we need a complete midfield reshuffle. Good that he not over spending on over rated players.. like we did for pogba..
Rashford is the main leak but he's protected by the club and the media
The player who thinks he has made it is Maguire, what a joke
Glaziers will never give up Manchester United its their cash cow   the golden goose
I  really dm Rabiot 14 mill ain’t bad least it’s ain’t 30 40 mill plus better then mcfred
Why can't Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk buy this club?
Why man utd didn't sing few players in winter transfer window??
Why isn’t Ziyech being scouted. Chelsea want him out for cheap
Y dont u take the initiative mark and unite all the fans as all appreciate u and follow u, we really want to this club to be successful
Gakpo plays on the left cutting in where we already have Rashford, Sancho and Martial. We need a left footed right winger AND a proper striker. This club is clueless
Sign Franck Kessie before he is registered by Barcelona. They can't afford him. He is Class and is a united supporter. He would make a massive difference to our team and would work well with Rabiot in a tandem with Fernandes going forward and Kessie tying them together with the neat passes.
I think if we could get Milinkovic Savic for like 30 million would be alright
De Jong to Chelsea is simple, it's called UCL.
So basically Rangnicks expertise was totally wasted!
Bid is coming goldballs
About Rangnick - 32:30: NO. He was an absolute clueless, naive manager! We were 4th! He dragged us to 6th with his nutty US assistant! Ronaldo situation wouldn't have happened if Rangnick had an ounce of coaching knowledge! Digest that. All this lack of attraction for CL is BECAUSE of him! Same players with Ole did much better!
The euro shouldn‘t be a problem, besides ronaldo, eriksen and maybe bruno i don‘t see anybody making the national team
Mark I can clearly see your head Is deep  up Ronaldo arsssss
Rabinot, please no...!!!
Ronaldo ran from rabiot at juventus cuz he‘s trash and now he‘s coming to united😭
Glazers get out because since your purchased this club on Loan this great club Manchester United you have lead it straight to the toilet loosing all it’s prestige and Past Glory! Chose the way to the toilet alone and let our Club free by selling to more knowledgeable new owners!
we're going to go another 10 years without a title
We dont need someone to buy us in debt. Need someone that allows us to compete
The only way we will see change is if we get relegated
This is where Mark loses me…I know Knighton is just trying to garner attention but Mark over exaggerating when he says it will take 7-8 billion to rebuild…Man U is worth 4-5b and it will not take 3-4b on players and stadium reno…that’s just making it seem hopeless…all someone needs to do is buy and make the club debt free..that alone will ensure a 200m transfer kitty every summer..we currently spend 100m on transfers on top of 100 on interests…
Bring Ander Herrera back from PSG..he can do the CDM role
Mark, they are organizing by walking out of Old Trafford. That’s how Activist’s work. If fans continue to buy merchandise go to the games; the Glazers will laugh at the sheep and nothing will fundamentally change. To invoke change, drastic changes need to be implemented. ✊
Maguire...more like Magwired to make a mistake every gameeeee
John Murtough is not experience enough to be football director in charge of transfers ... marina granovskaia did a good job for chelsea over the years ... balancing the incoming and outgoing
Let’s sign Ndidi 🙏🏾
Fans are sick of it Mark, i appreciate people trying to send a message and trying to do something about it! The walkout needs to happen at the LIverpool game.
David is still class but Fabian Ruiz can get cheaper
Rabiot is such a bad transfer
I feel for the season ticket holder’s having to sit an watch that crap boring football 😩 painful watching the highlights on telly
They have no self pride it's false confidence  and we all know its Maguire
We shouldn't be panic buying this where the trouble starts if we do
CR7 only played the second half and they blamed him, such BS toxicity in this dressing room.
Man Utd winning something again like finding planet 9 in solar system.  Man Utd winning the league again like finding alien life on exoplanet . This club all but doomed as long as Glazers the owners .
Calls a guy an idiot for talking about the takeover because there just rumors, and yet spends the whole summer making content on transfers based on what.... oh yeah rumors 🤣🤣
We cannot win with trashford starting, mcfred depressing the whole team, and maguire fucking up every 10 minutes...
Well said mark 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Mark you are so right mate about the protests, nobody is 100 percent in it together. Lots of in fighting between fans which was even spotted at old Trafford when we played Brighton, I can understand the frustration in the fanbase but why fight with each other, it’s never made sense to me.
The only thing that will work against the Glazers?    Don't buy the Merchandise!
Can't wait for this window to be over
MUFC... More like "Stop-Gap and Co."
if Ajax makes it to the quarterfinals of the Champions League with their players. Then Manchester United can now reach the final
The fans are as much to blame for this! Not reacting and accepting mediocre
Manchester United owners, the coach and players are not ready. Things needed to be change 💯,  that's the only way this team will prosper.
Mark, Use your Platform. To pressure the Glaziers. To buy the best players available. Instead of Panic Buying
The glazers were at old trafford on Sunday. Why didnt any fans go disrupt or throw eggs at them? The club is screwed if they continue to be owners.
Mark, Unite the fans. Forget the Twitter Campaign  With Polls to pressure the Glaziers. To buy the best players available. Despite Rangnick recommending them.
Michael Knighton is coming!
This has been the best and most passionate video yet mark!
Who the hell is u to vet what ppl want to do?
If all united fans don't out aside differences and past problems and don't plan well enough we won't get glazers gone we need to unite the base for until glazers are gone
PSV won against Monaco because of a brilliant headther of Luuk de Jong; maybe Man U is chasing the wrong De Jong? 😎
People are only apparently interested in buying United when fans are angry and protesting.  Says it all. Its bollox.   Until the day old Trafford is empty week in and out we are stuck with the glazers
We're linked with Morata now ffs..I agree with the Michael Knighton bollox , he ain't buying anything.
Fucking hell this is truly a tragedy. You had the guy in your hands!!! Ragnick was a real pro
Mark, Fans respect you. Do a Poll of the best midfielders and strikers and push for Saha, Lamier, Rice, Haidera and push the Glaziers online. To buy the best available
Agree with Simon Jordan and souness...becareful what you wish for removing the glazers. Man u are the most backed team financially. There's no guarantee a new owner will spend the same
RR is a legend. We would have had a  new full squad by now if we still had RR.  1step forward 2steps back FC
Might as well get Januzaj on a free with low wages.
Ten Hag be gone by January.
Ronaldo is a real distraction for Manchester united I think the players scared of Ronaldo he doesn't respect players who doesn't win anything
Say who that player Mark. Its Maguire
Man U should throw whatever cash is left at acquiring Antoni and use Martinez and Donny at the midfield and supplement with the youth over the season. And play Eric Bailley ahead of Harry McGuire!!
Complains about leaks from the club, then says he had inside info on a player who thinks he's made it. You couldn't make it up seriously
We will only buy the "right" players
If only we were like the Real Madrid fans who demand the highest standards.
De Jong to Chelsea isn’t going to happen. They just put a €90m in for Fofana apparently. Tuchel has said Midfielders are not priorities and it’s well known they want Fofana + a Striker.   Chelsea is a sexier team right now, it sells more because of the fact that it’s trendy to enjoy Man U failing + the new American buyers that’s why mainstream is pushing that narrative.  Marcell Van De Kraan reported from the Dutch end that Man U is 100% all in on De Jong still and that they even have a deal in place with De Jong but it’s being held up by the Wage legal actions by Barca.
so the leaks about players  that you get from the dressing room is good.......but leaks other journalist get  is bad, awful.....the self righteousness!
Why don’t we go for arthur melo of juventus he’s good will play as a six and never loses ball even in touch situations
Ten Hag needs to sell the cancer Maguire and give Ronaldo the Captaincy. To set an example. To stop the leaking
Thanks
The first time I realized the GLAZERS were the wrong people for us was the CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 2011  night at Wembley. Sir Alex squad was looking thin and we were told their is no value in the market.  We got stuffed with a very weak looking squad, that had done a lot of miles and had been in lots of battles before that night.  GLAZERS OUT!
You said we'd definitely get de Jong, now we're definitely getting Rabiot. Why? Why do you lie? Do you want the club to fail
Every player is a gamble......build a team............stop the quick fixes
De jong did an essien 😆
Why didn’t they get their business done in the summer, like City and Liverpool? City sign Haland, and United look for who’s available.
Michael Knighton isn't trying to buy the club. He's trying to BUILD a team of billionaires who CAN afford to buy instead. People who care about United.
The same snakes are still at the club. I'm telling you guys, shaw, rashford, Maguire are the licks. Standards have fallen so sad.
Are we in for Gaitan or Sneijder yet??
I don't think ten hag is panicking  He knows what he is doing
I'm really fearing for Erik I genuinely think we're going to lose against Brentford and Liverpool and that's gonna put Erik in massive trouble.
Has everyone heard of Michael knightons hostile bid to take over and get rid of the glazers?
Leimar ...not coming bcz our beloved coach don't want him. He wants to buy some Arnautovic but not Leimar. That's ego.
Ramona says a lot of things that dont work.
Hope they spend it on the right players 🙄
Get Paul Ince back on the show!
United could have gone for riqui puig
I believe Ronaldo is upset about the quality of players we're linked to and kicking a fuss and understands man utd should be doing more in the transfer market but these mediocre players fell it's okay and upset because they don't know what it means to WIN.
Gakpo rabiot and neves and that will ease my problems slightly
Laimar, laimar, laimar, laimar, laimar! 😭
Surely chelsea would sell you Pulisic
Knighton talks out of his arse. He bought my local team - Carlisle United!
Panic buys lol funny how there’s signings and de jong deal looks dead
Goldbridge needs to go to the gym, 6 pack advice speaks volumes 😂
Sign hard working laimar of redbull
Why are you rubbishing Knighton. He is a United fanatic and he has the contacts to get somewhere. I was here when he came on the pitch doing keep ups and you say we are better off with the Glazers. Get real I am offended for him.
Had they not messed about we could have had Timber and Antony for a good price and sorted other things and ronaldo might have been happier and de jong more likely to join
Panic? That’s going to help things isn’t it 🤦‍♂️
Overspend now on players we need. Don't delay and don't buy players we don't need. They've made a mistake, they can pay for it. Overpaying and getting top 4 will pay for itself. Being stingy and losing out on the extra income is going to be worse.
*Exclusive* Real Madrid bids 200 mil. + Asencio  for Mctominay
Goldbridge trying to unite the clans like Mance Rayder.
Just like Ragnick, Ronaldo, De Jong, and just about every other quality player in world futball, none of them want to be here, and they all know what a shitshow this club is. No top quality player is EVER going to come to this club, because why would they? There’s no vision. There’s no plan. There’s no method. It’s that simple. Just be patient, and eventually the Glazers will ruin the club bad enough where they won’t have any choice but to sell. Hopefully another owner will come in and put love in the club. Then start the mission of a rebuild. Until then, patience.
I agree with you mark on the glazer issue. Doing it and failing will backfire bad on the fanbase. Do it properly with majority of the stadium or wait.
GLAZERS OUT!!! This needs to be trending until it happens.
The Glazers selling United, will be like the De Jong deal.
Get Colleen into find out the leeks
You talk rubbish at times, knobody would buy united with (effectively) cash, they would leverage the club value to the banks, just like the Glaziers. They probably need an initial transfer fund on top but after the first year everything would come from club income. The question is to what extent new owners would want a return on the investment in the short term.
Why aren't we targeting or linked to Tonali??
Well, calling this “Ten Hag’s” panic certainly isn’t helping.
Until the revenue streams are hit nothing will change. Pressure has to be put on the bank that's servicing Uniteds debt to enforce any change. That was Liverpools solution.
Preseason seems like a distant memory now. I really wasn't expecting this 😞
Waste of time walking out of the stadium better to not go at all for two weeks and watch on tv or in the pub.
Laimar of redbull and dejong, belloti or morata
Mark be talking outta both sides of his. Face, I want the. Glazers out but. I won't. Do anything about it. Start the fire it would spread.
I beg to differ. I reckon United did do the research on Arnautovic but moved on with it anyway. Then when the fans hit back they retracted
United's (presumably very young and naive) Twitter fans getting excited by Knighton and trying to drum up excitement among others is one of the most toe curling cringeworthy things I've ever seen. Fella appointed himself Carlisle manager, got them relegated and put in administration the last time he wanted to buy United 🤣 he's a muppet and if Jim Ratcliffe wanted to buy United he'd have absolutely no use for Knighton.
Can someone explain why mctominay starts because I just don't get it
We're in serious trouble this season. Like serious could potentially not even get top half of table with that team
Gakpo is worse then Depay when he joined United. Played terrible yesterday, like he always does in big games
Has anyone stopped to think why they appointed McClaren, he's Fergusons mate and has already said Mctominay is an 8/10 every week. Fletcher was in Ragnicks ear every game now its McClarens turn. If they sign another midfielder then Mctominay will be his partner.
Another PR attempt to shift all blame on Ronaldo after the loss vs Brighton 😂
Why don’t United stand be the first big group to say it then, you say you want people to unite together but you take the back seat, stand up and Unite…. “United Stand” ? 🤦‍♂️😂
Any news on a deal with Celtic for their RB Juranovic?
get neymar in
If Goldbridge owned the club we’d have kits made by Boohoo Man active wear and be sponsored by Manscaped!
ETH has to take some responsibility for this shiteshow. The only reason the club went for De Jong  is because of Ten Hag. So the questions journalists need to be asking Ten Hag is what was Ten Hag told in private conversations with De Jong to obsess over signing him for months?
Ffs this is a joke bidding for anyone who can stand up
Mark you need to start The fellowship of the Fanbase 😄😄👍👍
These players got no integrity...
@16 mins who is this player that’s thinks they have made it
We need to take legal action I believe,if it's even possible  Take the glazers to court or in front of the football association Show them the problems with the stadium and the women's team how it was in shambles Try to make the FA make the glazers have to pay the $600 million they borrowed and haven't paid off or to sell the club An ultimatum of sorts
'MANCHESTER UNITED OFFER PARTICK THISTLE  €20M FOR SCOTTISH CENTER BACK   STU KINTMOUD' @endofchatsport
United will end below 6th.
Richard Arnold is Desperate Dan
united aint worth more than chelsea mark, no chance, not in this state
The closer to being “in the know” the less you know. - Mark Goldbridge
No matter who is the director of football, the Glazers will make sure, that the person couldn't do his job.  Deadwood gone, but have there been any change?
Sorry but not sorry. Rashford needs to go.
United on the transfer market, is as if they use Football Manager 2013.
Rashford, McTominay and English players who are leaking and wants Ronaldo to leave the club
Could be four straight defeats…what happens then?
No one with even a modest football brain can say with a straight face that Maguire, Mc Tominay and Fred are good enough to play for Utd.  Erik Ten Haag either believes they are good enough, or he does not have the power to sell them.  Either way, if those are the two options, he should not have taken the job.  He looks a right prat after just one game.
The problem is man utd they should never of let the glazers in simple as that
The problem with “I’ve made it” mentality is that if you’re on top already, there’s nothing left to climb. The only way is down.
200 k for rabiot only Salah earns that at lfc we are a tragic joke its time to let me emotions out of the club as its making me depressed
Michael knighton nearly ruined my local club carlisle united in the 90,s    He is hated around here and he is a massive bullshiter. I dont know why nobody is talking about his terrible past owning football clubs
100% agree Knighton is a charlatan.
Players who leak rubbish about Ronaldo should be dropped!
Te hag at ajax use to go out and buy players that had potential and then made them into top players. Why arent man utd doing this.  The whole structure is crap
Glazers Out, Stay Out... Don't walk out, just stay out
The fecker was useless at Carlisle Mark
Oil sheik FC..I'll drink to that😂
I'm a member of MUST and I watch TUS every day, keep it up!
But Mark don't you think the club and the managers has brought us to this point as players don't have to play well to earn there starting place and this makes them content and have no motivation to push harder. These players need competition and without competition their is no motivation or  will for them to achieve great stuff. If you play poorly and get a pat on the back saying well.done mate, you will think I have done a great job and believe that some of  these players have been treated as legends in this club when they are not yet one.
Very confusing channel you say your against leaks but are happy to say my sources in the club what’s exactly the same as a leak ffs your nuts lol
What a complete embarrassment if Chelsea get De jong and can only pray that we finish above Chelsea lol 😂 just to show De jong that he's made a mistake
I Will buy borre From Frankfurt....vardy From Leicester or portu From San Sebastian....iam better Scout than aby others....i Will do IT for free ....give me this job !
Ten hag as got to get tough with team in particular with maguire and Fernandez two very inconsistent performers yrs we need to change midfield and hopefully he's seen enough of th Brighton game for penny to drop  and dalot is also becoming a thorn in our side time to get tough Mr haag
💩💩💩
Rashford is that Player
Don't play maguire, scott, Fred, Shaw anymore 🤔. Replace maguire with Varane, scott with Martinez, Fred with de Beek, Shaw with malacia. Zidane iqbal replace rashford and De Gea will be the new Captain. Switch to 3-5-2, 3-4-2-1 or 4-3-3 with front consist of Martial Ronaldo Sancho 😃.
Glazers have brought the club down a peg OR 6 Woodward said years ago You do not need success on pitch to be successful off. Utd were massive 12 years ago and the team were winners........This is now ridiculous THEY are killing the CLUB and now taking the piss. ARE They doing it deliberately
Is the United stand in agreement with Michael Knighton?
Mark, you are SO right on all these points! I've watched United since Frank O'Failure, and I remember Knighton's first circus; he's a fucking tit, ignore him.
Jadon Sancho doesn’t have that yard to get past defenders…That’s another issue…
Nothing changed.. Season's just started but sadly gone. We are so hopelessly bad
We are buy deadwood players.
It's like watch collectors, will save for their favourite piece even if it may cost a lot more and takes longer to get,  however there are other watch collectors who will do a quick fix where they can buy a cheaper one to satisfy the moment, and regrets it after a few weeks.
85 mil of the 100 are reserved for De Jong, that will never come.
Ten Hag isn't the genius advertised. He thought he was so clever he could get a tune from McTomintheway and Fred. One match in and he sees what we've known for years. He thought Maguire could play a high line!? One game in and a 34 year old United reject rips that arrogance apart. He said De Jong or noone, then buys Rabiot in panic. Sangare, Tielemans and others are signed now and we're stuck with a French Mummy's boy! He agreed to Arnautovic!?   I'm not Ten Hag out......yet....but I will be if I see McTomintheway or Fred ever play for us again after this window is closed.
Id take Zaha in a heartbeat over what we have
You can't not buy a defensive midfielder this window.
Im gonna trust ETH no matter what, like how arsenal fans trust arteta
That guy kept repeating the same statement, and that made it suspect 👀.
No8, 39 and 5 play.... MU lost...
Things will get worse before it will get better. Stay strong and keep faith in our manager.
I’ve always believed that Rashford and Maguire were leaks because since Ronaldo came they haven’t like the love he gets from fans…
Why am I seeing Joe Rogan's face before the start of the video?
Only solution is to get Sir Jim to make a bid
So right thry didn't even research a player that their buying 😂😂😂😂 were run by thr dumbest people ever 😂
Mark you've been an inspiration to us all and me and my family thank you and the United stand family ❤️
Pitch invasion with banners
Rabiot working? He's the French Mctomminay with worse stats 🤣🤣🤣🤣
We’ve got teams like Everton signing Onana… a bright young defensive midfielder. Why aren’t we in for deals like this!
like to know what genuis allowed glazers to transfer all debt on club they took out to buy club in 1st place 1.5billion in debt thrown on club+still 600m owed
Dark Goldbridge
Anthony and a CD
We need to keep the pressure on glazers on
Why not go for Rice??
Mark I think Micheal Knighton had a much larger involvement with the club than just a failed takeover. I think he actually became a board member. I’m not exactly sure about all the details but I think it would be worth some research and defo get him on as guest
Mark what do u want they want to buy the club u said rumours
You could spend 200mil and I'd be willing to bet still not getting near the top4 that club is rotten to the core.
Michael Knighton' looking for clout. Agree with Mark, give us a breakdown on the Consortium on how you're gonna financial the bid
Something small to build on is getting as many in old Trafford chanting glazers out every game from the 58th-60th minute
wheather i like all ur opinions or not i always watch as i know u thoughts are based on whats best for the club, and sometimes people are scared to call certain people out because the lose credentials etc but i respect ur always urself
The best statement is to get on the pitch against liverpool.the whole world will watching
No...come on Mark. You are only not interested in what the other players are saying because its against Ronaldo.....
U can't buy your way out of the problems to many mercenary s.where is or what is your youth policy . Great clubs have local home grown players
Than to buy rabio or who so ever that not worth it, it’s better to give a chance to those youngster that are still very hungry. For god sake they can’t be worst than mc Fred
‘I’ve made it’ comment can only come from one player - Magdire !!!😡👎🏻
i just have a huge problem trusting Rashford,,,i just have a gut feeling that he is one of the problems in that dressing room..6 years same problem
give a hint of who the player is
remember when it came out of united that the leaks had gone after lingard and pogba went, now look. what a club ay.
do we think its possible the players commitment is influenced by the discontent and anger of the fans towards the Glazers.. i kinda hope Erik just walks away along with the big sponsors.. Adidas, Teamviewer....
We'd be playing in the champions league and singing top players   if Goldbridge and the rest hadn't pushed ole out
Let’s just admit, united are not one of the top 6 clubs.
Utd are a literal embarrassment to the game at this point, a name like that just withering away, they’re past the point of return, championship football within 5 years mark my words, the decision making has been horrendous for the past 10 years
The problem with protesting Is we have such a big fanbase so to get everyone on board is never gonna work
16mins in and obviously it's Maguire!
Well could you use your power to actually help get something done?
Mark, what happen with de jong deal. For close to three months you have been saying de jong will sign for united. In fact  you said 90% to 95% that de jong will join. Manchester united just cant get it that no top player will sign for united simply because of no UCL. But united still think that they are able to sign any player they want. Please, united need to wake up from their slumber. From the start of transfer window, they should have targetted those players that wont be playing in the champions league like bowen, rice, tilimens, bissiuma, ismail sarr, neves,kalvin phillips and so on. These are also very good players who would have jump at the chance of joining manchester united. These are players that already have the experience of premier league football and doesnt need a lot of time to bed in. Instead united kept on targetting de jong, antony, martinez, malacia who are also good players but may not join united because of no UCL. Although martinez and malacia join but they may not be as good as those mention above. Martinez has a height disadvantage, 5'9" only compare to other CB in the other clubs. Look at spurs signings, all are above 6'. Spurs will have a very tough team this season. I dont know how martinez will square up with haaland who is 6'5".
Should use the 100m on Antony and Dumfries. Fork up the 70m for Antony and 30m for Dumfries. No midfielder but at least they are ten hag first choice signings.
even the people bidding for us are a joke... United needs to join the modern era.. and quick..i think their thinking is stuck in the 90s
UTD we stand, UTD we fall
A walkout would be a very big statement But it wouldn't matter if only 50% of the fans do it or everything is back to normal after the Liverpool game And Old Trafford is packed for the next home game It doesn't work like that
Wonder when frenkie said no was it before the Brighton game but ten hag thought mcfred would be OK and saw it for himself now its panic mode.
If all fans boycotted going to games and buying shirts etc, things would soon change,, shame wont happen....sick of watching boring players who dont care if they win draw or lose as its still a pay cheque
Surely united fans should have one aim which is for the absolute benefit of the club, that can only be glazers out and rid the infestation of businessman making footballing decisions.
Brilliant Mark.  Hit so many nails  🔨
The glazers are just taking the piss at this point. They think they’re invincible.
We Need To Get Noni Madekue Since He's Got More Ucl Goals In His Career Than Gakpo
If fdg deos not want to play for man UTD then so be it. You are obsessed with him yet he's another di maria in the making. Let the club go for players who are willing to play for the club.period
it is not actually Ronaldo’s fault that he is the biggest beast in United’s jungle , It is a situation Sir Alex never allowed to happen. That this situation exists is a function of United’s decline over the last nine years. Scott McTominay and Fred cannot play the way Ten Hag wants from midfield, I understand that  he need Frenkie de Jong,so that he could play in the style he wanted. Our transfer looks like supplementing the squad rather than changing the paradigm , to build success in a league vastly more competitive and developed than the one Sir Alex had to conquer, you would want to give Ten Hag the best chance , even Sir Alex will struggle with this United Team, United Board and the League of Pep , Klopp , Tuchel and Conte ... whether Erik accepts or not , He is about to be thrown into the deep end of his career , we shall see if he will survive and win or he sink like David Moyes just 10 years ago
Do not show up that is the proper message that will hurt them more then anything
All the talk of being an  "inclusive and diverse" football club and the own fans considering other fans "not real fans" because of living millions of miles away, the disunity, the agendas, division....it's a finished club. I'm happy I never encouraged my kids to support this never ending shiteshow and they ended naturally gravitating to support clubs like Chelsea, Barça and Atletico.
It will be interesting to see who gets dropped for Brentford I could call for 5 players myself !
Knighton would be worse than the Glazers
Without a United fanbase nothing will ever change. This is why our fanbase is just as much as fault for our club's failure, because fans of other clubs would never allow it to get to this stage.
Can't believe in past three years we let go player like Ander Herrera Pogba Matic Mata go for free
Man Utd are just a heart break. Ima stick to COD Warzone to heal my wounds
Stupid club.
Love the show
Imagine demanding someone prove everything b4 you believe it yet you sit here saying "my sources and I've been told". You are the most egotistical person on YouTube me this me that I have the biggest channel and all these followers. It's not about you pal 🤡🤡🤡🤡
Pochettino will solve all problems at Manchester United
Manchester United - A club where fans are celebrating 'signing not made - Marko Arnautović’  where other club fans celebrating 'signings been made' !! 😁😁
