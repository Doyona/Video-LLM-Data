As watching the squid game in English, the sets are incredibly beautiful & so well done 👍 the sets are incredible, in the English version they start with 456 people. I’m impressed how they are competing for 4.500,000 million I seen few get emlimted and disappear. Into nothing, they must have safety mats even if going down a shoot & going into black hole from snakes & ladders,
A dang demon kpop movie for kids beat it💀🙏
Wait, when I was looking at this video, the thumbnail is the players are wearing blue but not green. How is this?
3:20 6:16 324 and 250 are my favorite in season 1

This make feel good bc squid game i is suposte to be qcary but not this
the acting, the realism, everything...wow. no words.
The really spent money
I loved that they used set designers to get their ideas across instead of CGI. Back in the day that's what they used in all the horror movies.
The staircases gives me that german expressionism feeling
4:25 what’s going on with the right guards mask
A Crime to watch this dubbed
Wait so the guard 011 right did they actually cut her face?
How about the season 2 that guy that pee
Totoo ba Yong namamatay sila ask lang

This is game like MRBEAST
hi!!!!
Legends watching in December 0 2024
이드라마는 스토리,감독,배우,미술,음악까지 모든게 완벽.
Oh god, it's collider... Do I see this through..... All fluff and no substance. 😊
glass brige best 1!
This is not even a behind the scenes, more like cash grab content from squid game title
헐뭐냐 ㄷ
😂
Masterpiece❤
I want eo ask was it ever nominated  for an oscar?
Yeah we don't speak Korean we speak bloxs fruits
7:30 me to my Mom showing the Star given by my teacher coz I was very good in class☺️
Fun fact: number 096 in red light green light is different. Cuz there is a scene where we see number 096 is pretty different to the one of the glass bridge
did this video just say 'a dutch artist, mc escher', like everyone doesnt know mc escher by name
''I once played the marble games,so it reminded me of the Past''   No! 💀🗿
Who also knows about what player 001 did in real life
3:44 why did you blurred it? it is a fake gun
wild
Loved this show, excited for Season 2!

I hate it when people say listening to the original version is better whiles you don't the language.that means you always have to watch to understand. If I don't get English audio, I can't really watch.How would you know if the subtitles you're reading is correct??
Yes is real

All are genius, all did well, I was very very impressed and enjoyed the movie
such a good film cant wait for season 2 !
참가자가 관심을 기울이면 알수있도록 벽에 그려진 게임의 비밀은 자본주의에 대한 비유입니다 우리는 작은노력만으로 글로벌자본주의 작동원리의 불평등한 비밀(ex 기축통화,자유무역,관세,주식,금리 등)을 알수 있지만 알려고하지 않습니다 한 사람의 경제상황은 그 사람이나 정부의 잘못없이도 파산할수 있는것이 자본주의입니다 어떤국가의 국민은 금융자본에의해 살해당하고 어떤국가는 강대국에의해 군사적행동없이 살해당하고있습니다
Squid Game is one of the best shows I have seen in a long time, the production, story, acting, music, visual style is absolutely top notch, so much hard work goes behind the scenes to make it, so many creative people truly came up with a masterpiece. 👏👏👏👏
Something about fighting to the death at the end, getting started for some reason would be the scariest to me, but glass bridge would come in close second.
The cameraman never dies.
I love what you do
I also want to be in the competition ❤
This game was so cruel but so hard to make😭
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉😂
This is a masterpiece ❤
That playground made me feel like a kid again, until they started killing them 🤷🏾 I'll pass 🤦🏾😂
I do 90% of my snubbie training with targets at 10 feet, which is the distance the FBI says most civvie shootouts happen at. Further distances bring up questions of "If the person was that far away and without a gun, what threat did they pose to you?"
Dubbed is factually and objectively inferior. I nearly vomited when I heard it on this video.
*POV* you forgot your Spanish lesson because you’re have no money

Even tho i was never one of the people who got into squid game, tbis stuffs really interesting
2021 emploi quiz😢
Why are you ruining every video with comment or music...god
did they have real guns
Bollywood can never touch this kind of creativeness with sets and visuals. The camera work was amazing when players used to fight to kill each other.
What a show!
It's July 2023 and I've just now watched this for the first time. Wow. How incredible that was. And I normally don't like shows in other languages but this one was voice overed well. I'm from the USA btw. ❤
The fact that they built sets as elaborate as that, especially the one with the stairs inspired by art, is mesmerizing
Gimana matinya
ALWAYS WATCH SERIES OR MOVIES IN THEIR ORIGINAL LANGUAGE WITH SUBTITLES. THE DUB ISNT GOOD.. EVEN IF THEY TRY TO SYNC.. IT DOESNT WORK WELL.. I EVEN USE SUBTITLES(ENGLISH) TO NATIVE ENGLISH ONES BECAUSE OF THE DIALECTS..

Squid game is fake is just a movie just chill
After watching squid game I’m so fricking mad at you

"One question. If we win Just how much do we get?"
Who actually watches with dubbed voices? It’s intolerable.
*English DUB...*  *Y I K E S.*
I don't know if it's just me, but when I saw the colorful  and crazy staircases, I was immediately reminded of Dr. Seuss. 🤷🏿‍♀️

Im so glad they spoke English instead of Chinese with English subtitles!!!
I wonder if there will be a season 3
We want season 2
Oh i thought the stairs were inspired by harry potter-
Red light, green light was the most intense for me. A giant doll with scanning eyes 👀 if you move an inch, you're dead. Its all so creepy and terrifying. The stairs are my second favorite, Escher was an amazing artist, I used to look at his book of art when I was young. The 3D images he created were like nothing else at the time. And still very much like a puzzle. The rooms get darker and darker as the games go on. Showing the darkness that lurks through the city after so many died. This show deserves awards. It is so original as well. So well written. Now we want to know whats going to happen, if we ever do. I hope.

One detail that no one mentions, what a terrible father he is to his daughter. He’s not trying. I feel bad for her. She deserves her mom and step dad.
Bro your editer blured out the guns
Meow meow
I agree 😂
My family is part Dutch so that is a surprise
This video seemed like a last minute book report. You said nothing about anything in your rambles. Sets were expensive, how expensive??? Actors were in awww by the size of the sets, how would you know??? These actors were so happy to be apart of this. Like WTF??? you could say that about any film production.
I started this show yesterday, binged watched all day and finished it today.
This webseries has just blown my mind. Can't express in word's that how outstanding this masterpiece is.
Jadi macam mana yang orang mati tu betul betul ka mati atau tidak
Did the actually use guns
Pls time me shout out I subscribed and like and watch whole video.
Explaining Squid Games Behind The Scenes Set Secrets: 👉https://youtu.be/vVRdRPFFbjc Squid Game is Netflix’s latest surprise smash hit, with the Korean-language horror drama on track to be the streaming platform’s most-watched show ever. Because of this, a lot of people have come across different theories on TikTok and Reddit, and since we have no idea when we’ll get a second season, let’s unpack them all.
Squid games is nothing compared to hell.
This is some good talent!!!
They literally said no to green screen lmao
It was quite painful eight minutes to watch. The subtitles were misleading and the voice is annoying
Was the Squid game Guns was Just a Nerf gun?
Mr. Beast: interesting...
That’s cool😎
My favorite scene was the playground.
crazyyy omg
I was wondering if that was in real life?? And wonder what are in inside the squid game masks
Camera man in green light red light😂

The stairs the people walk in squid game reminded me of the Harry Potter stairs

Do they die in real life
Kuoliko ne oikeassakin elämässä

Can't wait for season 2
Oh, yeah!
i feel sorry for everyone that watched this masterpiece in English dub.
Is it a killing game
If you watch this show in any language other than Korean, WITH your native language for subtitles.   Youre wrong.  This is not negotiable
I hate hearing the dubbed English. It’s so ugly.
1:56 6:24
£[£\£]£>\¶£{¥}
how about the way they got shot in the first  game
I like how they used very little cgi.  I’m not a fan of cgi.
Nah bro dub is cringe asf 💀 💀 no cap sub is way better
I would probably die in squid game cause in 4th grade I always lost in tug of war and crap like that 🫠
huh?

This film makes me want to play childhood games again, but then i remember the terrible bully was happening between kids during our games.
Did people actually die?
Red light green light
No doubt Mr Beast was writing this down for when he was working on Squid Game Games

how?!
I though squid game was real I keep getting bad dreams thinking that its real Thank you for bringing behind the scenes
LoL.. the sets built were actually INCREDIBLY CHEAP !     Probably one of the most successful low budget sets in the last few decades though.    It was popular because of the story, not impressive cgi and studio sets.      I mean if you find these incredibly basic sets amazing .. your brain would implode if you went on a set like Dark Knight.
Heard dub and exited video
Squid game  is  not real 😌
were the people really dead? i hope not
Is the killing real? Pls tell me it’s not
#9 is so fine bad bad guy but good acting

Imagine making this masterpiece and peoole just watched it dubbed.

The diagrams on the walls of the dormitory remind me of the ones from the video game Portal, which sometimes offer a clue to how to complete the puzzles. The art style is similar as well as the idea that they offer a hint at how to play.

Great news of the squid game
Green light red light
So glad I watched Squid Game in Korean with English subtitles. It’s weird seeing the English dubbing in this making of video. The giant doll in Red Light Green Light is so much cooler with her sing song voice in Korean, for example.
This was the last video i've watched in 2021 😳😳
Did they atually die bc if they die i am gonna not watch ur vid...
Wow that so cool 👁️👄👁️
Why is 212 ching

Just the way that red light/green light scene was done in English immediately tells you it shouldn't be watched in English. That creepy song that doll sings is so perfect for the scene and the English version just has some exciting robot voice saying "Red light😊, Green Light😊".
Did they really kiss?

When you watch this it seems so interesting than when you watch it itself

U literally said nothing
I absolutely  love squid game
A little girl did the dolls voice witch is so crazy and the girl said she wanted her next line to be ready or not here i come
My dad has the staircase inspired picture
Meanwhile Mr.beast did the same thing in less then 2 months
The real squid game is much more scary then the behind the scenes
my fav part in squid game is when they run from the doll
Mother fucking ads

4:48 Kudos to the camera man as well
next time use the sub not the dub for your video
Image result for meaning of lmao LMAO is an acronym that means “laughing my ass off.” Some people use it as a synonym for LOL. ... It's best to use LMAO informal conversations. read more...
Evil at its best!
How did they make the place big🤔😲😮😧
Lá casa de papel is better
Remember the first episode:  That one guy: hey dude... dude... uh are you, faking? Him: -spits out blood- The one guy: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I'm still very in love with this show since its release. I don't know how many reaction videos to the show I've seen now haha

Why are you using english dub? I'm not saying its very bad, but the Koreandub  is better.
why does gi-hun sound like such a loser in english???
I INTERVIEWED THE WINNER OF SQUID GAMES ON MY CHANNEL!
Phim con cặc gì. Có 100 người , chết 1 trò, trò sau vẫn đông y nguyên.

Lets just Admit that the reason why korean   s are good is because of their Realistic ACTING.. You all know why we all LOVE  Ninja Assassin although its an american movie the Main character there is Ji Hoon(Rain) a korean star

Came after Mrbeast video
Mr. Beast managed to create a very similar set. Unbelievable.
Its so cool what and how they make it T.T Like if you agree-
kokkolaaa kohh sayyy saayyy jaahhhh koehwaahhhh koehhhhhhhh
green line red line
Squid game like  kids play
I'm sensing something  People: English subtitles are better than English dub/We watched all episodes in 1 day.  Weebs: Hmmmmmm... *stares Veteran Weebs: A little more push and we can turn them into one of us.
It was so real.😳😳😳😳 I even asked a friend Did they really die😂😂😂
Green light Red light
asian movies and tv series are fricking amazing
It could have been a series that I would watch if it didn’t have to be about killing when you lose. Where instead of dying, you get kicked out for loosing .
Korean movies or series mostly build there stages and dont use cgi 🤷‍♂️ take note hollywood 😝 and get mister beast to be a director xd
0:10 Mind-bending stairs inspired by "a piece of art."  Really low effort writing there. I'll find a different video.
Omg i love this 💗💗💗😘🤣 muve

Mr Beast made a replica of the series.
Ok
Give your life to Jesus Christ because He is coming back
The American dub is not it. Way better as the original Korean.
Me beast
I would never play tis game in real life, i mean it doesn't happen irl Anyways s-  Meanwhile* North Korea~ Uyghur Muslims in detention camps~ Syrians~ Palestine€ (Who else?)
Meanwhile mrbeast

Red light green light
What Mr beast done is also very impressive
Honey come
Still haven’t seen it only haven’t cause i don’t wanna be a bandwagoner
MrBeast: I don't need green screen or blue screen i will build them!
Is this real killing
3:44 why was the gun censored? Is there a YT policy about showing weapons on videos?
Wait...I just realized...they literally didn't see the writing on the walls...  Definition of "the writing is on the wall" —used to say that it is clear that something bad will probably happen soon _I haven't lost my job yet, but the writing is on the wall: my company just laid off 50 more people today._ -Webster   🤯
It would be rlly fun if i was there it was gonna be fun,Their voice acters and its fake blood and its a act!
And now Mr. Beast did this
There is 7 games in squid game. lights out lol.
How bout the blood
Omg..... thank goodness the people in squid game did not actually die and it was just a set.....
Looks like shit after MrBeast video
Mr beast>>>>>
Hire mrbeast
Please don't watch this with English dubbed audio .. You can get subtitles it's much more better you can feel more emotions to it in their voice and then it just suits the whole environment and the character so go for the real one
Squid Game Nice BTS

Not dubbed..... omg that’s embarrassing
More quality at @MrBeast

Sub over Dub!!! Who else agrees?
Mr beast did it without cgi

Me watching real squid game: shit everyone is dieing me watching this video rn: OH I THOUGHT IT WAS REAL

*spoiler*.  I liked following il nam, mostly before you learn he’s the sociopath architect. Korean with English sub is best.

If you watched it without subtitles and the english dub, you've done yourself a disservice IMO.
Like for SEASON 2 of THE SQUID GAME

Other people: *watching the vid*      Me: how u know abt that? Are you the creator of squid game?
hey uhh in the part without cgi in red light green light i saw blood spladder
Lollll
green light
The one thing that bothered me with the games is, they would have like 5 minutes left in a game, they would just be talking forever, then you would see like only a minute went by. 5 minutes clearly has expired in real life. I freaking loved the show, though!

Excellent high performance 4k quality gaming https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RucmHQKn90M

This Horror Show Shows Who We Are A student of mine told me about a new show called “Squid Game.” It is a South Korean “thriller series,” as they call it, which has become a pop culture phenomenon and is the no. 1 show in more than 90 countries. The show presents several hundred people who are all in great financial debt and in dire emotional states. The producers pit them against each other, even if they are very close, and make them hate each other. The winner takes millions of dollars, and the others are killed. This show wouldn’t be so horrifying if it didn’t portray our true nature. The very fact that we watch such a show enthusiastically is proof that underneath the “civilized” façade, our nature is as the show depicts. It works like a magnet. We love to watch the struggle between good and evil, as long as we are safe from the consequences of the battle. The thing is that in this show, there is no good; there is only evil.  Indeed, humans are the worst being in reality. What makes us so uniquely evil is the fact that we explicitly want to harm others. We do not want to eat others because we will starve unless we do so; we want to see them suffer! We derive pleasure from others’ pain, and derive the most pleasure when we are the ones inflicting it. We often say that reality is like a jungle, where the strong eat the weak. However, in the jungle, the strong do not want to destroy the weak; they want to eat. Once they are full, they want to sleep and play, and not kill or hurt for fun. In the human jungle, we do not want to eat other people; we want to see them hurting! This is why the natural jungle thrives without any laws while the human jungle, which we mistakenly refer to as “civilization,” is disintegrating despite the laws that strive to limit our barbarity. If we had any hopes of finding goodness in human nature, “Squid Game,” and mainly its popularity, proves that we have nothing to hope for when it comes to human nature. If we can create such shows, and if they can be so popular, then we can do such horrors in real life. The only possible good that can come out of such a show is the realization that it is not fantasy, but an authentic depiction of who we are. Maybe if we realize this, we will be willing to do something about changing ourselves. The current trend is to dull our awareness of the human horror show we live in by making cannabis available and legal. Indeed, the more we learn about human nature, the more we realize that perhaps it is better to numb ourselves through life until it’s over. For now, we’re cheering at the sight of other people suffering, much like people used to cheer at the sight of poor men fighting against lions in ancient Rome. Only if we realize that it is not okay to be like that, our minds might open to other options. If such a diabolical program can be the no. 1 show in more than 90 countries, it means that the entire world is immersed in unhinged viciousness. There is a solution, but it is demanding and must encompass the entire world if it is to succeed. To change who we are, we must initiate a worldwide educational process where such programs are forbidden and pro-human-connection programs are produced and aired. Even if they are not popular, at first, we cannot allow ourselves to be exposed to the violent poison and culture of narcissism that we consume today. They may be sweet, but they are lethal. If people don’t want to watch shows about human connection, they can put aside their media devices and simply talk to one another. This will already be a major improvement to the current situation. It may not sound like fun, but what is the option? To live out the “Squid Game.” Besides, after some practice, we will discover that connection and care are far more rewarding and pleasant than destruction and cruelty, and do not carry the negative side effect that is our current culture...

Hearing the show dubbed in English is so weird lol
Looks like a real  blood when they die.
The lead actor always sounds drunk in the dubbed version. Like a drunk Keanu Reeves.. and why does the guy who says "if you do not wish to participate..." have a Chinese accent?
Dang

Was the guns a  Banana?

This narration was way over the top and completely disconnected from the people's actual statements. If you have to sell movies and shows with this amount of agog, "movie magic" talk then what you're selling is a weak product. Also, the crew is more important than the cast. Maybe don't just talking about actors constantly.
It hurts me to think ppl actually watched this in english sub, it ruins it all💀
I don't understand why people choose the dubbed version instead of reading subtitles on the original... I undestand that maybe some people struggle with how fast the subtitles are, and of course I understand blind people... But other reasons? I'm not judging, I'm actually curious to know why people make that choice, I personally think you lose a lot of emotions in the dub.
ONLY KOREAN VERSION ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  wonderful
What ?!
this show was stupid
Que bueno
Wow

The sibilance on the voiceover is rather harsh.

All anyone can talk about is squid games and tbh i haven’t seen it yet but i want to really bad
One question about the pious individuals subscribing to the Christian faith: is that a realistic depiction of Korea's behaviour towards them? They seem to be quite polarised from Korean culture in general.
piss off.naked,bullshit people,and commonly destructive person under me
Reports: Netflix CEO gets BUSTED with 13,000 files of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY...and he owns Danny's pizza gate and they make mcdonalds hamburger from the baby flesh
Squid game made me want to watch more Korean movies now.....
So there's 455 people died with guards all 455 deaths

What it sounds like: Ko koaa ko che kea stongthe ah
I'm so speechless. The movie is sooooo incredible and can't wait for the season two
''one question..if we win how much do we get"i cant xd
I hate it when they kill so many main leads in one series like Ali, police officer sae-byeok, ji yeong  Gi hun's mother like whyy?? You need to kill so many peoples in only 1 series you can still keep going...why would you need to done sad ending all sudden in only one series ....its so frustating when these peoples die I HOPE SESSION 2 FULLFILL MY HOPES ....
"had an intense nostalgic experience" "I once played marbles"
squi gaming!!!!

Squid game is scary and my bestie are love in dock! 😫pliss stopp bestie! 👩🇧🇩wow have you see im Have too see red light green light! 🤼‍♂️😫
I loved dubbed shows in animes however this dub was so bad I couldn't
Lah
As an avid fan of Korean dramas and variety shows, I'm not surprised w/ the squid game's set . It's like in the variety show Running Man. In every episode the set is always superb. I think it's really a Korean production team thing.

I'm so happy to watch an Asian show and I hope to watch more Asian shows in the future.

PEOPLE WHO WATCH DUB SHOULD BE PARTICIPATE
wait so they r not dead?                                                😑
Wow
error error the error is can you give me the MMMOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYY
The best series of last 10 years
Woow, Very Interesting Game @/aaliasyed
you guys act so good omg if I were in squid game I hope I won
They are good at acting like died just act
Trust me, in two years from now, every figure about the squid game on YouTube will read in billions.
Nice game
Memang ......mantapppppppp.......
Now we can see the face of the workers Imao
Just imagine u picked the umbrella 😂
To all the people saying you must watch with subtitles, get off your high horse. Watching a show with subtitles doesn’t make you cultured. A lot of people would rather just watch then read a books worth of words on the bottom of a screen.

its a good movie
green light red light
Aso nato gatat mit sampya
This voiceover audio is super boxy sounding... Great vid otherwise though
It wasn’t that great. I laughed the whole way, get over it.
WOW
Awesome series. I really enjoyed the effects and the story line. 👍🏼
UwU
4:40 did anyone notice that the doll is having squid game logo hair clip
Best show I ever watched. Thumbs up!
If I would play this in real life I would be dead
Glass bridge event was the best 😎
If there's blue screen there's CGI. Saying there's not on those shots is ridiculous.
Proof that people are already tired of physical and social distancing due to covid19
Is not squid game
I'm proud to be an Asian 🌏
https://youtu.be/ZYu-pByUVRc Hi. I made a "word search game" with the words in the squid game. I look forward to it being fun.
Were there live
noob
It would of sucked to be the first person to die 😂
I don't wana read subtitles personally so I will probably never get the tone from the Korean perspective but who cares I wana focus on watching not reading. Stop policing how we should enjoy the story it's a democracy 🤣
Asians make better stories let's be honest.
childs violent savage game gets popular
Is that much best?
The way the commentary tries to hype of every little thing as incredible is funny. Here's an example at 5:05:  Commentary: "The actor who plays Number 1 had a really intense nostalgic reaction when he was on set where the marbles game takes place." Number 1 actor: "I played marbles once. So it reminded me of the past."  Apparently "Yeah I played marbles once" is the same as a "really intense nostalgic reaction". lol Looks like I'll be having a "really intense nostalgic reaction" later today when I remember the dump I took this morning.
The part that turned me off most about this video is the use of English dubs. WHY. It does not have the same impact as using subs and the native language.
the glass is like walking on eggshells
My brother keep saying squid game is real but not real actually
After hearing Gi-hun in the beginning, I'm glad I watched the sub
its a great show but its so much better when you watch it in Korean.
Green light red light
i swear the doll- I can’t.
The effort THOO❤️❤️
Did they just… put ketchup and just sleep?
How did they die?
Imagine having seen the doll before it appeared in squid game.
The giant doll is the girl from my neighbor totoro
This is cool
It sounds so cringe dubbed
Ccccxzfrdzcggdfgyygg
Rtettyeeee
It,s much better with their actua l voices with subtitles,
I played ttakji with a MAGA hat boy in front of White House : Why is Squid Game an eye-opener for Americans  ▶️ https://youtu.be/wWB9QB2qGts
Why are they wearing blue, instead of their green, track suits in the thumbnail? 🧐
I was recommended to watch this in the original Korean with subtitles, I'm glad I did as the overdubbing sounds awful. It also loses a lot of the reality and nuances of the original script.
Tell us in the next video how does the guard see?

Where's 영희's right hand~? Oh... ~.~
Did you know that squid game starting name was round 6 because it has 6 games 😲😯😮
Good job 👏
Lee Jung-jae is such a great actor,from Il Mare,Deliver us From Evil (as a villain)...he's so versatile,hands down👏👏👏
Wait you’re telling me the stairs were inspired by MC Escher 🤯 That’s crazy!😝
glass bridge
Did they had to die irl
The staircase set was a carbon-copy of Ricardo Bofill’s “La Muralla Roja”. Kinda disappointed he wasn’t mentioned when the reference was loud and clear.
pure art 💛

Imagine playing #324 in the first game. "So where's my script?" "Here." "This is just 3 lines" "Read the 3rd." "You imminently get shot after being spotted by the doll."
Red light green light for sure.   The horrifying realisation of what this place really is makes it the stand out set.
the english dub is hilariously garbage-i get not wanting to look at subtitles a lot but its a million times better in Korean

This Horror Show Shows Who We Are A student of mine told me about a new show called “Squid Game.” It is a South Korean “thriller series,” as they call it, which has become a pop culture phenomenon and is the no. 1 show in more than 90 countries. The show presents several hundred people who are all in great financial debt and in dire emotional states. The producers pit them against each other, even if they are very close, and make them hate each other. The winner takes millions of dollars, and the others are killed. This show wouldn’t be so horrifying if it didn’t portray our true nature. The very fact that we watch such a show enthusiastically is proof that underneath the “civilized” façade, our nature is as the show depicts. It works like a magnet. We love to watch the struggle between good and evil, as long as we are safe from the consequences of the battle. The thing is that in this show, there is no good; there is only evil.  Indeed, humans are the worst being in reality. What makes us so uniquely evil is the fact that we explicitly want to harm others. We do not want to eat others because we will starve unless we do so; we want to see them suffer! We derive pleasure from others’ pain, and derive the most pleasure when we are the ones inflicting it. We often say that reality is like a jungle, where the strong eat the weak. However, in the jungle, the strong do not want to destroy the weak; they want to eat. Once they are full, they want to sleep and play, and not kill or hurt for fun. In the human jungle, we do not want to eat other people; we want to see them hurting! This is why the natural jungle thrives without any laws while the human jungle, which we mistakenly refer to as “civilization,” is disintegrating despite the laws that strive to limit our barbarity. If we had any hopes of finding goodness in human nature, “Squid Game,” and mainly its popularity, proves that we have nothing to hope for when it comes to human nature. If we can create such shows, and if they can be so popular, then we can do such horrors in real life. The only possible good that can come out of such a show is the realization that it is not fantasy, but an authentic depiction of who we are. Maybe if we realize this, we will be willing to do something about changing ourselves. The current trend is to dull our awareness of the human horror show we live in by making cannabis available and legal. Indeed, the more we learn about human nature, the more we realize that perhaps it is better to numb ourselves through life until it’s over. For now, we’re cheering at the sight of other people suffering, much like people used to cheer at the sight of poor men fighting against lions in ancient Rome. Only if we realize that it is not okay to be like that, our minds might open to other options. If such a diabolical program can be the no. 1 show in more than 90 countries, it means that the entire world is immersed in unhinged viciousness. There is a solution, but it is demanding and must encompass the entire world if it is to succeed. To change who we are, we must initiate a worldwide educational process where such programs are forbidden and pro-human-connection programs are produced and aired. Even if they are not popular, at first, we cannot allow ourselves to be exposed to the violent poison and culture of narcissism that we consume today. They may be sweet, but they are lethal. If people don’t want to watch shows about human connection, they can put aside their media devices and simply talk to one another. This will already be a major improvement to the current situation. It may not sound like fun, but what is the option? To live out the “Squid Game.” Besides, after some practice, we will discover that connection and care are far more rewarding and pleasant than destruction and cruelty, and do not carry the negative side effect that is our current culture.

4:25 the guard on the right beside the doll has a "pause" icon on his mask. Does that mean originally there were 4 levels of guard hirachcy? 🤔

Can't believe ANYONE actually watches shows out of the native language the show uses. Looked and sounded horrible with English in this one. Glad I saw it in its original form.
The sets in the series were amazing
Oh

ppl r trying to cancle squid game
"Had an intense emotional reaction to playing marbles" yea I played marbles once. 🤣
Let's all agree that this show is best enjoyed fully in Korean(if you understand it) or Korean + English subs.
I have to say. The set design was a 100/10. I love seeing film makers use less cgi and more set design. It takes allot of time and money but my god it’s so worth it. Good job Korea!
Why do they all of Black Hair but the old man
Hi
Hi
How did they make the people die without killing them for real
This squid game is fake right
Hopefully this will convince people to watch many Korean films like Parasite, The Chase, Unforgettable and many others.
Are they using English
Masterpiece!
Hollywood must be soooo envy of these productions.  Probably kicking writers skulls cause they can't come up with such original stories like this one.. well done people,  well done.
I love it
DID you know that squid game is the now most popular game it’s everywhere at my school elements tree is a blonde up on the squad game!
4:36 I thought it was sgi😆
the most exciting scene to me was the tug a war fs
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
at first i thought this was all real
Respect to the people who bulid the tug o war and the stairs one.
ពិតជាល្អមើលខ្លាំងណាស់ 😵🥺❤️

So many Easter eggs
After watching The Squid Game, I felt like somehow I used to play Red Light, Green Light in my elementary school days.

I watched squid game they burned the bodies how is it fake
It was so good like holy shit! Can’t wait for the second season!
I saw girl guard
But is the Dead fake?
Dub is so cringey and unnatural. Especially live action.
2:52 great artist, but his name sounds like a Minecraft username
The dub sounds awful. Also, the staircase scenes look like La Muralla Roja, which is an apartment complex in Manzanera, Calpe, Spain.
“Had a really intense nostalgic reaction”  ….  “I played marbles once”  I hate these overdramatic script videos that hardly show any ACTUAL behind the scenes footage.
so there’s no season 2??
There are way too many people on here who think they're royalty just because they watched it in the original language😂😂 ignorance is bliss

If you watched this in English you didn’t watch squid game. They sound super stupid and makes the show awkward I don’t even speak their language but it’s so much more enjoyable to hear it in their language.

We often say that reality is like a jungle, where the strong eat the weak. However, in the jungle, the strong do not want to destroy the weak; they want to eat. Once they are full, they want to sleep and play, and not kill or hurt for fun. In the human jungle, we do not want to eat other people; we want to see them hurting! This is why the natural jungle thrives without any laws while the human jungle, which we mistakenly refer to as “civilization,” is disintegrating despite the laws that strive to limit our barbarity. If we had any hopes of finding goodness in human nature, “Squid Game,” and mainly its popularity, proves that we have nothing to hope for when it comes to human nature. If we can create such shows, and if they can be so popular, then we can do such horrors in real life. The only possible good that can come out of such a show is the realization that it is not fantasy, but an authentic depiction of who we are. Maybe if we realize this, we will be willing to do something about changing ourselves. The current trend is to dull our awareness of the human horror show we live in by making cannabis available and legal. Indeed, the more we learn about human nature, the more we realize that perhaps it is better to numb ourselves through life until it’s over. For now, we’re cheering at the sight of other people suffering, much like people used to cheer at the sight of poor men fighting against lions in ancient Rome. Only if we realize that it is not okay to be like that, our minds might open to other options. If such a diabolical program can be the no. 1 show in more than 90 countries, it means that the entire world is immersed in unhinged viciousness. There is a solution, but it is demanding and must encompass the entire world if it is to succeed. To change who we are, we must initiate a worldwide educational process where such programs are forbidden and pro-human-connection programs are produced and aired. Even if they are not popular, at first, we cannot allow ourselves to be exposed to the violent poison and culture of narcissism that we consume today. They may be sweet, but they are lethal. If people don’t want to watch shows about human connection, they can put aside their media devices and simply talk to one another. This will already be a major improvement to the current situation. It may not sound like fun, but what is the option? To live out the “Squid Game.” Besides, after some practice, we will discover that connection and care are far more rewarding and pleasant than destruction and cruelty, and do not carry the negative side effect that is our current culture.
Dubbbing for Americans :(

Everyone and everything was great in this series except for the VIPs. Their acting was so artificial.
What a compelling show
This Horror Show Shows Who We Are A student of mine told me about a new show called “Squid Game.” It is a South Korean “thriller series,” as they call it, which has become a pop culture phenomenon and is the no. 1 show in more than 90 countries. The show presents several hundred people who are all in great financial debt and in dire emotional states. The producers pit them against each other, even if they are very close, and make them hate each other. The winner takes millions of dollars, and the others are killed. This show wouldn’t be so horrifying if it didn’t portray our true nature. The very fact that we watch such a show enthusiastically is proof that underneath the “civilized” façade, our nature is as the show depicts. It works like a magnet. We love to watch the struggle between good and evil, as long as we are safe from the consequences of the battle. The thing is that in this show, there is no good; there is only evil.  Indeed, humans are the worst being in reality. What makes us so uniquely evil is the fact that we explicitly want to harm others.

glass bridge scene forever got me shook

Green light red light

also they had a pretty low budget for such a show
They did amazing 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾
Entertaining🤩
Thanks siri
I couldn't look away from the screen when watching. I think it's because it was a real set and characters and not cgi. It was mesmerizing!
Directors ought to take note on the importance of using real people instead of CGI. Boy does it pay off.
Squid game English dub is………….
Why use clips from the dubbed version? It just looks and feels wrong. Who in their right mind even watches the dubbing????  Unless you have like dyslexia or some other problem that is
I love the red light green light is my fav one
!Jesus loves you!
It has been 2 days since I finished watching this series and believe me , the acting , direction and setting of every scenes was so excellently done that the killing of players still haunts me. Player - 67 is the most beautiful player ❤️ and it seems that acting was tougher too. But she did it well and I can't forget her beautiful , secretive character. She was so beautiful ❤️!
If only that big warehouse is real, I am sure a lot of foreigners will go to Korea to visit it including me. Please create a big warehouse like this for real🙏🙏🙏🙏
I thought the stairway idea came from The Labryth
3:35 Damn word salads. “They were made out of the same material as tunnels?” Woooow, who knew?! As if an iron sword  and an iron spoon made out of the same thing he mind blowing.
Nooooooooooo Thank you for your marbles sir

I LOVE sae bioc
Who watches this dubbed 🤡🤡
Bollywood should learn from rising Korean industry  Nepotism and Love drama is killing our Industry
WHY THE DUB
Watch with subtitles
I hate you😡
Stop talking
its a 456 in 52M chance in being an actor in that thing
E
overrated
Who likes the song "He he he he he he" ?
This show almost generated $900 million and only cost $20 million to make
so cool :OO
I just got to say did they acc kill them...

Dubbing sucks
https://youtu.be/wMHyCTaY3Ps
Eewwww!! English dub🤢🤮
Hjhk
No one is going to visit that museum where that giant creepy doll is reinstalled lol unless you are fan of the series.
Amazing🔥🔥🔥
I got to the part when there was 3 players:3
I was also glad to see that this show didn't adopt the anti smoking garbage where none of the actors smoke. This show really gave more sense of realism by adding the cigarettes to some characters.
KAMI BUTUH TRANSLATE INDONESIA KAWAND!
If the show is in Korean, I listened to Korean. If the show is in Japanese, I listened to Japanese. No dub, coz original is always better ✌️
So...they aren't gonna  tell us how the bathroom scene was made?
Okay good those deaths weren't real
Daily reminder: Gi-Hun is cute

Bro, do americans watch it with English dub?? Korean language and the way they speak is truly a huge part of the show and the overall emotions around it.  I suggest everyone to watch it in original language with subs
Ali Abdul hahaha 😆
English dub is a fucking joke
മലയാളി ഉണ്ടോ..??

Peoples : we don't like Korean movies/series    Squid game : *Take back your words*
The way the childlike sets contrast the gruesome murders is so coolll like the pastel colours in the stairs, the nostalgia in marbles, the playground in honeycomb
무궁화 꽃이 피었습니다  🔴🔺⬜
The last challenge was kind of stupid. All you had to do is use the railings on either side of the glass to walk across. No need to walk on the glass at all.
Wow just wow 😳
All my friends told me to watch it dubbed but i only watched about 5 minutes dubbed it was so much better with actual voices and subs
Why you always say word ahkdwkdhakdhwkdjsk
Is it real blod
It help me understand that there is no true friend
mark rober
They used blue screen not green screen bc their outfitz
I don't know if you know this but in the movie some players died but there still alive
The doll areddy had a missing hand
No one : Gi Hun : I think that's what she said
I really liked squid game because even though there were only a few characters the show focused on even the side characters felt like they had real character, from the start to death.
Netflix Hit The Highest Rate Wit This Drama👌, Because Even Those That Don’t Like Korean Drama Will Start Loving Korean Movies Starting Wit This😘Kudos To The Cast And Crew Of This Drama🤛For Those That Haven’t Watch It Yet I Can Boldly Tell U That U Are Missing A lot😚😚😚
Hooray! Years ago it was Game of Thrones. Then this.. Now time to wait for 5 more years to get another decent show. Can't wait!!!
Directors needs to know that killing all characters is not cool. They keep following the same formula: false hope, character stories, all die. and the mases love that for some reason.
Why does the narration audio in your video sound like it's coming from a tin can?
I was so scared for the killing part but just editing!
Series was good
This show was weak and completely overrated
Weird they didnt ask what would happen if they lost.. Lol
Why is there almost 9k dislikes ?
Waiting For Season 2 ✌️
Green Light 💚  Red Light🔴
Sgit this grabbed popularity like the movie battleroyal that what made pubg style battle royal games
https://youtu.be/fsvprEOlVhA
gg I was in SQIUD GANM
Very nice movie .love from Bangladesh
Red light
Well u realise all they had to to was look at the wall to know what games ur ganna play 😭
why didn’t any of them notice those wall pictures 🙄🙄. They could’ve prepared for all the games
I'll be honest the sets are not that good. I love the show because of the acting, character development and story. Just because a set is big and vast doesn't make it good. Quality over quantity any day.
These sets were so much realistic and horrible 😳
😯
I would love to walk through the staircase set.
Voice over wasn't to bad. But what's next? It's the series over? If not how will it improve?
I wish I was behind the scenes it would be so cool
I LOVE IT
sounds like you didnt know shit about the tv show or the details then you wanted to make a video about it.   No hate intented
Wow
Asia the best in world
This is by far my favorite show ever. Better than game of thrones or breaking bad. The AMAZING set design and art department has a lot to do with it. Every set was mesmerizing
😨😨
are they alive or there realy dead
hi
The VIP viewing lounge was also very impressive and unique. I like how they see the Games happening in front of them.
What waste of money
Fake
Can't wait for season 2

DoActually die?
Bruh the dub watchers watching this and acting all confused as to why people were saying things not English during the interviews lmfao
oh
Doll's child's play 2029
All film producers need to understand this, MORE CGI DOES NOT MAKE IT BETTER!
Hellooo
Did you watch a video because i watch something thats a same thing as this video and squid game is fake and real,and you get killed to
Green light
So in the show the people did not really die
I wonder did the people got shot still alive or dead let me know becuse idk
🥰I LOVE IT 🥰 But.. how do they pretend to die?
Red lite green lite. 🚦🚥🔫🩸
Red light green light
Kubrick would have loved this show.
The green light red light game actually has CGI - blood. There are a lot of blood splashes in the scene and if you look carefully you can see drop never fall onto the surface of the clothes.
Bro you hid the pistols but not the mp5
Wow
Is that real blood?
It was a good programme but not to the extent its has
I didnt watch series often but Squid Game watched in 2 days and it was a Masterpiece like Band of Brothers
I just realize that the game is on the wall.
Squid game fake
Grenn light 😞red light 🙂🙃
Ok but  if it eas a real place it wouled be a indoor park
god the english dub is crap
This shows that hard work does pay off,like this is the most popular movie on Netflix
Oh my god, there’s a dubbed version?
It’s all fun and games till you hear a doll saying red light and hearing shots from a museum
Don't show the dubbed stuff... It's embarrassing.
Pretty cool how the camera man was playing red light green light aswell behind them lmao
You idiot, you give a lot of ads
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Repent Jesus Christ is coming soon
Matthew 3:2..
Condemn is still best as campare to it
The cgi in tug of war episode is really noticable, I mean it's to be expected xD
*someone dies* squid guards open the doors...COFFIN DANCE SONG STARTS
https://youtu.be/QHctFhStMzE    About cg
The MC Escher set w/ the pastel colors was really quite impressive and imo a brilliant contribution to the show.

https://youtu.be/p_iRukb1znY
Fun Fact :  The body painted extra actors got 4,000 dollars in 3 days of their work
Nice 2 full 20 sec comercials, dislike
I like that scene when they play tug of war
keep a weather eye on behind the squid game scene tzueno
The dool hair has the squid game logo on its hair
I love squid game i like the acting
i recommend you always watch shows in original language with subtitles, dubbing always loose the sincere work and emotion actors convey !
It’s better in Korean with subtitles the heck
I have to agree much better in original language with English subtitles 👌
At the last game sang woo die he kill him self cuz sang woo let gi hun win the money so gi hun cry on sang woo cuz they friends

Anyone else wondered how losing team on tug of war would get down then suddenly a blade chops rope sending them to their death😂😂😂👍🏽?
Bruh
“The background shows real impact and expression of the story” THEN WHAT STORY IS THE VIP LOUNGE DECOR SUPPOSED TO TELL?

how does the guards see through the masks?
While I was watching this I started thinking that this is kinda related the the hentai euphoria, with how people are trapped and must go against eachother to make it out, and I never made it past the first 5 minutes
Please don't watch this series dubbed. Use English[CC] instead and leave the original (Korean) voice.
Sure thing but how did they get blood for the movie
https://youtu.be/n7-pY2OZjkE
Lreen gight led right
Wonderful, Amazing, 🔥 waiting for next series ?
I was horrified watching English dub 😂 If you’re planning on watching it, watch in Korean with subs
No one needs this irritating commentary over the footage, it adds nothing. Seriously sounds like the shit I'd write in an essay the night before it was due. Also, first time hearing the dub of this show, sounds terrible. Feel bad for those who need it and dissappointed in those who don't but chose it anyway.
What?! There are  actually people who watch this with english audio instead of their own voices?!!!😂😂
hard hard
Is “Squid Game” a REAL Story???
2:35 the beds were made from tunnels???..

IThe Game
This show is far from over. And I love it!!!
Dont attack me but i watched it on engilsh dub
This is the only thing about this show that I actually will see…. To me is disgusting how all this creativity is used only for exalting k1ll1ng, then people blame ohhhh why there’s k1llers on my school…… but well “humanity” hypocrisy and rotten everywhere
Red light pew pew pew green light
ياه الله شو متعوووب عليه

I thought the sets were mostly partially built and then amplified with visual effects to make them seem bigger, I had no clue they actually built the entire thing for the most part.
Lovely ...!!!!
Tremenda ...!!!!
I Like squid Game ❤️
Jesus loves you ❤
now i can call my friend squid
6+6=12

How to see drama
Green light yellow light red light purple light
Why do people are dead are they still alive
Deserves to be famous drama
-rep used the english dub
Not a very diverse show. Should probably cancel Netflix due to their blatant racism.
Am I the only one who was reminded of labrynth by the stairs?
If it’s covered up by something, you can’t claim that it’s in plain sight
This show deserves an Emmy Award!
Subs over dubs
Mrbeast: today i got my subcribers  to compete tons of  money Peapol:
WHAT A PERFECT FLAWLESS SKIN 😍😍 I LOVE KOREAN SKIN
So ready for season 2
4:40 Wrong. The Squid team newly made the doll, and just kept it temporally there.
Green light            Red light
Green   light    red                                                                                                                                                                                        gtggkkt

TOP👍👍😍😍😍
Keren film nya aku suka
I’m glad I watched this with subtitles, hearing those little snippets of the English dub ruins the emotion I think.
2:40 these artistic stairs remind me so much of the music video from ‘do it right’ from Martin Solveigh🤯   Here’s the clip:   https://youtu.be/wQRV5omnBBU
https://youtu.be/r0jODaz6QOA 😂😂😂😂 loving this idea of squid game
If you like deeper meaning reviews I did one for Squid Game here on YouTube https://youtu.be/vB5AcCUj508 ❤️❤️
God bless, Jesus loves you and died for you all
When the people die do they actually die or is that’s fake blood?
at 4:26, what's with the pause button symbol on the guard that was never showed in the final product?
thing is how did u make the doll its cool
The English dub is terrible. 🤭🤭🤭🤭
HOPE IN LOVE ❤️👑🤍👑💙 Salvation is found in no one else, no other name under heaven given among men where by we must be saved.  Saved from the punishment of sin.  I’m trying to offer people Hope in absolute perfection !!!  No more pain, dying, lies, decay, depression, anxiety, crying, sickness, rotten food, broken things , etc...  offering the Hope of Eternity in heaven with Jesus Christ.  We must be willing to turn from sin and to believe the Gospel, Mark 1:15 to receive Jesus forgiveness.  He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1 John 2:17 Visual Bible movies on YouTube. Matthew, Acts, Luke, John   ❤️🤍💙 💜👑✝️📖nkjv 🧎‍♂️ 🙏🙂 🌹🌹🌹
So the doll lost her hand
The money 💰thing hoo
Wow it's great
Yes the elite ruling over the working class. How brainwashed this world is 😅 in plain sight and still thick as pig sh*t
With as much attention to detail and just pure production, Hwang Dong-hyuk is the modern day Stanley Kubrick.
When you get out of the way of creative and talented people and support them instead of letting studio execs run everything, this is the quality you get.
I've whatched squid game already but three times
Turning their life upside down = getting them killed , wao
woo
I LIKED NONE OF THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No no no please why are you watching the dub
To be honest I think the camera man won the game.
Game:calls it red light green light Me:calls it green light red light
Gee another alumanati show. Enjoy your selves in 8 years.
In Christ Jesus Victorious name, may every ingredient in the stab, with perfect alchemy be changed to water... and that manipulated DNA be miraculously converted back to God’s perfect design. May any evil plans of tracking and control via AI short circuit and any 5geee interaction with these ingredients be intercepted by the mighty hand of Jesus. No ill health effects on anyone. Perfect almighty protection and broken evil alterior motives in Christ Jesus Holy Name. All evil spirits associated with anything against humanity be bound and cast into the courts of heaven for the ultimate Judgement and if no repentance be thrown into eternal blazing fire.  AMEN❣️🙏🏼
I haven't watched the show yet because we'll I'm still a kid but I love the squid games that is shown on yt because there isn't much killing shown
This Horror Show Shows Who We Are A student of mine told me about a new show called “Squid Game.” It is a South Korean “thriller series,” as they call it, which has become a pop culture phenomenon and is the no. 1 show in more than 90 countries. The show presents several hundred people who are all in great financial debt and in dire emotional states. The producers pit them against each other, even if they are very close, and make them hate each other. The winner takes millions of dollars, and the others are killed. This show wouldn’t be so horrifying if it didn’t portray our true nature. The very fact that we watch such a show enthusiastically is proof that underneath the “civilized” façade, our nature is as the show depicts. It works like a magnet. We love to watch the struggle between good and evil, as long as we are safe from the consequences of the battle. The thing is that in this show, there is no good; there is only evil.  Indeed, humans are the worst being in reality. What makes us so uniquely evil is the fact that we explicitly want to harm others. We do not want to eat others because we will starve unless we do so; we want to see them suffer! We derive pleasure from others’ pain, and derive the most pleasure when we are the ones inflicting it. We often say that reality is like a jungle, where the strong eat the weak. However, in the jungle, the strong do not want to destroy the weak; they want to eat. Once they are full, they want to sleep and play, and not kill or hurt for fun. In the human jungle, we do not want to eat other people; we want to see them hurting! This is why the natural jungle thrives without any laws while the human jungle, which we mistakenly refer to as “civilization,” is disintegrating despite the laws that strive to limit our barbarity. If we had any hopes of finding goodness in human nature, “Squid Game,” and mainly its popularity, proves that we have nothing to hope for when it comes to human nature. If we can create such shows, and if they can be so popular, then we can do such horrors in real life. The only possible good that can come out of such a show is the realization that it is not fantasy, but an authentic depiction of who we are. Maybe if we realize this, we will be willing to do something about changing ourselves. The current trend is to dull our awareness of the human horror show we live in by making cannabis available and legal. Indeed, the more we learn about human nature, the more we realize that perhaps it is better to numb ourselves through life until it’s over. For now, we’re cheering at the sight of other people suffering, much like people used to cheer at the sight of poor men fighting against lions in ancient Rome. Only if we realize that it is not okay to be like that, our minds might open to other options. If such a diabolical program can be the no. 1 show in more than 90 countries, it means that the entire world is immersed in unhinged viciousness. There is a solution, but it is demanding and must encompass the entire world if it is to succeed. To change who we are, we must initiate a worldwide educational process where such programs are forbidden and pro-human-connection programs are produced and aired. Even if they are not popular, at first, we cannot allow ourselves to be exposed to the violent poison and culture of narcissism that we consume today. They may be sweet, but they are lethal. If people don’t want to watch shows about human connection, they can put aside their media devices and simply talk to one another. This will already be a major improvement to the current situation. It may not sound like fun, but what is the option? To live out the “Squid Game.” Besides, after some practice, we will discover that connection and care are far more rewarding and pleasant than destruction and cruelty, and do not carry the negative side effect that is our current culture.
Why are all crying for marble gamr
I also want to play all the games
❤️
Nice! Check out my EDM SQUID GAME REMIX: https://youtu.be/pzXuE_DZhag 🦑
I don't get the praise. They didn't use much CGI, which is unusual these days, but it's nothing new to build a set by hand.
This serial is sick and people who are watching it, are sick and morally death people .. humanity died..
I hate that TheThings chose to use the english dub here. Please use the original korean with subtitles! Let the actors shine!
Squid game is fake?
the dub loll
Hati hati
The English dub sounds so cartoony and phony
You will be eliminated ..... means Oh yes it means you will get headshot 😀
DONT WATCH IN DUB
watching this show in dubbed is such an injustice
“I watched Squid Game with English dub” 🚩 🚩🚩🚩
Squid game/the rise of markiplier
Bro they did ali darty
The fuc**** glass thing
lets hope african americans dont take kdramas and go "LOOK GUYS WE MADE IT COOL TO LIKE THIS"
The English version  is not that great like the Korean version
Asian creativity Green Light ! Hollywood Red Light !
Jesus, are you dumb as shit? Don't use the dubs in your clips. Use the English subtitles (not the CC subtitles). It's not that difficult.
They made the games where kids usually play a lot more intense and violence.
https://youtu.be/p4GEucVJJlo
Oh  wow
The staff hiding their identity and wearing costumes made it interesting
Ew, why did you use the English dub? It sounds awful
What is the blood?
This show is more then just killing  Try to see that this reality is no different from the real world Sad story about people want to stay alive to win money
yuh
Shocking but ... fabulous
Actually those staircases look a lot more like La Muralla Roja building in Manzanera, Spain. The architect is Ricardo Bofill
Using the dub audio huh... It's trash
I’m surprised, the cameramen went into an actual death game for a show.
The most scariest thing about Squid Games is  watching it dubbed. But we all know watching as what it’s meant to be Korean is way better.
Congratulations on an amazing creation! I have been listening on repeat. You're one incredibly talented human being! Keep on creating and stay humble! ❤
*triggered by English*
I still can’t wrap my head around how cool cgi is
This is the Korean Art we want. Not GayTS(BTS)
3:45 did the guard flip her off?
i want the mask of the frontman^^
Kkkkkk kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk 😹😹😹😹😹
I just gotta say, major respect for the makers of this show. Nowadays directors seem so lazy and just keep remaking movies or cliched ideas and filling them with the same actors, uninteresting sets, and TONS of CGI, so having something with a TON of thought and effort and love was poured into it is extremely refreshing and I wish we had more of that
The old man is VIP btw
Nadie en español aquí 🤔 no entiendo ni 💩

J'aime trop squid game
I'm so glad they were given the budget they needed to create what they wanted
The Giant doll is a Little scary🥲
Watched all episodes
You can really feel the emotion when you watch it on Korean language instead of English, hearing the original voice everytime you watch a k-drama or k-series was really amazing.

I'm happy that the old man is not died I thought that was real

Red light Green Light
The set squid game
I can't never forget how nose piercing girl sacrifice her self. Seriously it was the most emotional episode out of the TV series
The marble game is nostalgic. Missing the old days where you play with your friends outside of your house until sunset/night. I don't know about western children but most asian felt nostalgic watching this as it reminds them of their childhood. Minus the violence.
I already watch this
my fav is Sae byeok
If your watching, don’t watch it in English dubs, there terrible and takes out the characters tone completely

Korean movie recipe : take the best page from everyone's book and make it your own... But all better
It's cool to see that this was made so long ago and now its the most popular show on Netflix
Fuc it’s not good et all
The intro to this video is super ignorant. Of course the sets look great. It's obvious they look real. Practical effects in hollywood have made a huge comeback recently, partly from the fact that more and more people can discern green screen from the real thing. On top of that, its way cheaper to pay set designers and carpenters than digital effects artists sometimes. Mainly in scenes where multiple shots from different angles are taken
That shit look like squid game
Glass game....
3:28 I paused at this moment to see another old man at the bottom
Imagine waking  up and that giant doll is in your bedroom. 🥴
I love it
Me: hi!  Person: hello  Me: did you watch squid games?  Person: UHM no I hate squid game  Me: hOw dAre YoU😠😠😠
Person: gReEn ligHt ReD LiGht  Everyone -😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲 Me: Hi     Replies F--K YOU  Me: ok🙂
Best for all times💯💯😍😍
👍👍🙏
Me when gun is censored oh the things you gotta do to not get canceled by YouTube
if I owned the whole squid game thing, I would open "red light, green light" to the public! no shooting of course! I would also have opened glass bridge, but instead of glass, it will be trapdoors with an electric lock underneath, witch a computer randomly selects one on each "pair" of 2 tiles to be unlocked each round. And instead of a big scary drop, it will be a drop of 3 meters into a "pool" filled with those soft cubes that are found at trampoline parks.
Ail is in tik Tok😱😱 but he is alive
Social ya am it's eh who is do tell ital pick em if all is well ug eh ic to him cup katuig still idk off ug eh us well in El in ha do ha
This will always be amazing! Advantage of good imagination. Honeycomb for me

So basically they’re all a Family behind the Scenes. Now I can sleep in peace.

Why is this video using the awful English dub? And why is the gun censored at 3:44? Are Americans too sensitive to guns? Am I missing something here?

Something Extraordinary 😍
So was the moving stairs in the Harry Potter movies they were also based off that painting
Yet no one knew the answers was on the walls of the dorms the whole time
Did anyone watch this dubbed?
I think what they should do every season is have them take place in different countries  Russia, England, Mexico, and America
WHAT HAPPEN WITH DEEP NICE VOICE LEE JUNG JAE GO FOR ?
Squid games was so good I watched it again
선넘네
Ga bisa bahasa inggris
CGI is over used now. Thats why movies aren't like they use to be in the first place. Everything looks fake as hell. But they did good with this I thought.
Once you start watching Korean dramas, you can't get out of it. For those who haven't seen it yet, "My Mister", "Stranger", "Thank you", <<< Let's get started.

I did a freestyle to the squid game sample lmk if 🔥 or 🚮
So happy they used practical effects as much as possible. I do believe that is why it such a memorable show to watch!
No one even die phew
And i was at the final level of squid game roblox and i died:(
Never try in home
Imagine not watching this in Korean
Most of the actors were better than most Western actors, and they were still dubbed over
The beds frames are what they use for industrial warehouse shelves.
That english dub sounds horrible, why would anyone prefer to watch the show dubbed over watching it with the real voice of the actors? Doesn't make sense to me
Largest shopping mall in Canada 🇨🇦😍 https://youtu.be/HtX8Kr_QX3s
I want to squid game real
Squid game is good but it’s too over hyped
Blurred out one gun and not the various MP5A3s…..ok?
I just can't believe there's some people who willingly chose to watch the english dub over the korean version. The VA was SO bad.
The Video: I think that’s what she said  Me: That’s what she said 😏
GECOLONONISEERD
Anyone have the actual behind the scenes without the commentary?
If u listen to the  English dub 😭
the set of the glass stepping stones was so aesthetically beautiful
I wonder why it's called SQUID? 😵😵😵
Rip off bollocks. Nothing original in this shit fuck of a series.
Take note Disney, no forced PC transgender nonsense and a hit.....  no gay superman, or black female 007, just story telling.
After 100 years or 200 years this movie is going to be a benchmark for everyone. Kudos 👍 to the director Hwang Dong-Hyuk ❤️

Haha😷😷😷😷😷😷
Jesus Christ anything dubbed ruined everything
You highly missed out on the shows authenticity if you watched this with English audio🤧🤧
People saying the korean version is better. Duh watch anime and you will understand.
Please don't watch this show with an English dub.
Wow....impressive
As someone who has worked on TV and movie sets along with theatre. I have to give them a lot of credit for the size and quality detail they included in the sets. It could be so easy to VFX it all but it's so much better when it's real.
EwEw ItS dUb  And did you know the doll was based off an old Korean textbook
오징어 게임

No social media beggar

If only squid game creates a museum out of all six of their memorable sets..
Can someone tell me why the other guy didn't tell the main guy to choose triangle or circle in the cutting the biscuit challenge?
English Dub is the best version, I enjoyed it very much and was more impactful. I loved it
this video made me realise how bad dub is for series  like these
Did people actually die?
I wish they talked a little more about the front man and the guards. I thought they were really cool, wanted to see behind the scenes for them as well
So ail is alive?
1:21 II-Nam is not the only elderly. Look to the right of the thug. You see another elderly.
Gee wiz, never knew they would actually use real stuff for set scenes. Impressive!
Didn't know this was dubbed.  Glad I saw it with subs 👌🏽
Squid game is a copycat of Liar Game!
Do dey realy day h 2,,?
I do absolutely love squid game but I hate the part where someone dies, like, why can’t they just be out?
I love green light and red light
I always watch this it is soo xool
Do they actually die
The squid game reminds me of my childhood game it was tug wall or something then when the person turns around nobody moves it's like squid game but when we win different person will be the doll or something?
💚Green Light - Red Light❤
I HAVE NEVER HEARD THE ENGLISH DUB I AM SCARED *unsee/unhearjuice* _-big sip-_
amazing series
Do not Sochi
Why did you put it dubbed
Did they actually die though?
Nice
The fact that red light green light is my favourite childhood game and after watching squid game it gives me nightmare....thanks k drama from ur south Asian fan
the legendry squid game movie is the history of asian films....with so much action and damn it sure encouraging towards the real world to step up and fight against this pandemic ...can't we relate? this pandemic is a squid game and we are contestants trying to save our life ..damn our Asian film is so 3d phenomenal ,it is a brilliant success to the world whoever the director and script writer is I couldn't applause them enough 😎❤
Thanks to all of this project  They are legend
game này chúng tao đã chơi mấy chục năm trước rồi
Please DON'T WATCH THIS SERIES with the voices subbed. It's not only terrible, but it takes away from all the little inflections and nuances from the original Korean voices. Listen to THEIR voices and just go with the English subtitles or whatever language you know.
Never watch any show with English dubbing. Watch with Original sound and read subtitles.

I would've peed myself just doing the tug of war it still looks scary af behind the scenes lol
Holywood just wasting money.
😍😍😍😍😍
Building that set must have been costly
I know it
oh its fake I now it yes yes
wow
Is this like hunger games movie?
Dub user 🤮
Vera level vera level
The original Red light Green light game played in Korea has resurrection rule. Players got caught during the red light gets hand in hand with the... it/tagger making a line of players got caught and anyone gets close to the tagger cuts the hand ties with a tap then everyone run away from the tagger. Then tagger gets to run after them before they run back to the starting line. The show eliminated the resurrection rules purposely and killing players immediately makes it shocking even more.
So glad people are exploring outside your boundaries but lets not just mash it all up and call it 'Asian'. We all know how Indonesia, India, South Korea, Afghanistan and Mongol are different and unique in thier own. And I am not gonna call 'La Casa De Papel' an European TV show when it is a Spanish. Come to think of it, isnt the term 'Asian' sounds too inclusive?
Who else watched squid game
I just realize that mostly everyone had black hair even the doll
4:39 OH GOD ITS REAL OH NO...PARANOIA IS SINKING IN
its disgusting to watch this on english dub..
Hay
Adakah org Indonesia disini?
มมววววบง
wish that no one is hurt at every one is not hungry and greedy
I LoB this series....💛
why dont they try to build a room with out a gravity so we can walk in the stairs upside down
Green Light Red Light Doll would now terrorise anyone at the playground where it's now re-installed. I suppose it can be seen as a 'life lesson'
If i were the player that is playing red light green im like just do nothing cause im scared
I feel poor the the old actors but since they also get remined of their past its good i guess.
Bro they used so much budget for this filman d it's all returning to them because of the support people give.. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL AWESOME BUSINESS.

If you’ve watched money heist or any other foreign show you get used to them not being synced
Yes. Budgets are better invested in sets than catering and hotels. Good for the local workers too. I hope more will follow suit.
I WANT TUG OF WAR
No1 movie🍿🎥
Can we just say that the paintings in the dorms were the actual games planned the players couldve looked at them and couldve figured out a plan to beat them
People actually watched the dub? Holy shit that never even occurred to me thank fuck
dont lie tho. if you didnt watch squid game for fun you watched for  Sae-Byeok
the doll is SCP-173
can we just talk about the fact that they used the dubbed clip in the beginning?
can someone pls tell did they actuallly die pls the truth
The ubiquitous index anecdotally unpack because height cytologically moan including a mighty kamikaze. proud, vacuous christopher
the fact that I don’t watch squid game and know nothing about it- And I’m actually happy about it
The show is not That genius and amazing...
Red Light green Light is easy so i like it
Fuck. That was so sick
Are the masked gunmen wearing pink or red suits?
Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
We deserve squid game 2
Orang indo mana nii😁
This desire of the Director (Hwang Dong-Hyuk) to create as much of the scene physically possible and minimise on CGI is at basically Christopher Nolan - dark knight levels.  Incredible achievement!
❤️❤️😀😀😘😘
The eng dub is so cringe af
I love squid game
You talk too much.😁
I love red light green light
Make this in hindi 🙏🙏❤️
I am glad that people don’t actually die 😳
Are they dead real life
I am just.... relaxed.😌
Kdramas are always detailed. To the props, to backstories of every characters, even support characters has interesting backstories. Making Korean series/movies way ahead of other countries. Koreans are perfectionists, and we can notice it on their works. If you watch more korean series or movies. Most will definitely have an impact on you. They know how to make you cry and laugh literally.
I love all the love this South Korean block buster series is receiving while North Korea is just sitting in the dark
Well they got exposed lol

Is the body's die in real
Only psychopaths watched this dubbed

Y is dubbed even a think, ur just giving yourself hell if u watch dubbed
How many of you (and I) chose to watch it subbed instead of dubbed. I always watch stuff like this subbed so you can actually see the real emotion in the dialogue as intended.

Was the show dubbed in English  for the USA? Netflix Canada was subtitled only.

Na batatinha frita eles mataram de verdade até passou no jornal dizendo que algumas senas morreu

Wow BUT actually it's really hard to filam it wow great work
This shows that this series is not overhyped
Squid Game was everything. I love the cast. It was so hard to hate certain characters as the betrayed their friends. I was so torn.
Its english dub 😭😭😭😭

What a set what a web series hats off
Game 1 was a thriller
They said all the games are the games which were played in childhood,  how come that bridge game with tempered glass normal glass was being played in childhood?
‘
Growing up in the 80s 90s. This was a cheesy and lame show but good at the same time. Past movies blow it away on scary, creepy, suspense and fear. New gen have no clue
Fun fact: all players we grabbed from many places speaking many languages but somehow they all understood each other "as presented to us" 🤔😂🙄
2:40 that scene/style is also very simular but better in the old movie "labyrinth" much more mind bending 🥰
3:41 are you serious, you blurred the gun 😂?  Oh no, not the gun, my eyes can't take it, i'm watching the video because i obviously watched the whole show, saw people die, fall, get stab, shot, cut, hanged.... But not the gun, ooohh the humanity
Test
my favourite character is 001 and 456
I watch the real movie and I was so scared
2:45 song name? It's so familiar but I just can't remember the name.

Did they actually die
I legally own a gun and I am insane
They really went all out on this one Good one
Please watch this in its original Korean language.. Don't watch the English dubbed version..
It’s so popular but my teacher says it’s to violent so I can’t talk about it 😞
Don't waste your time watching this. Some of this is wrong and it's almost entirely regurgitated information from Netflix's actual behind the scenes video with the cast.  For the REAL video search "Squid Game | Behind the Scene | Netflix" it's on Netflix Asia's Youtube.
Red light green light
Ew I can’t believe you’re using dubbed scenes

Do yourself a favor and watch with subs and their original voices.
Why squid game dubbed in english :(
I just watch all the episodes
Great show and I'm not huge on shows!
One thing I noticed: The guards (playstation shapes) are kiling the people who are playing 'oldschool' games? Symbolism?
Still can't accept the fact that Sangwoo killed Sabyeok😢
Other people: is this money fake? How come there's so much. 🙄 Me: the cost of this movie were more than you think, the people that can make this movie maybe really got real money for it. 😶
This show is no doubt going down in history as a classic. Iconic in its time
🐯🐯
Whyyy.. Why are here to hear it be dubbed..? 🤦🏻‍♂️
hahah i like this itouth tge squid game is real
Squid game is the best series ever it’s my most fav ever no one can beat how good it is
I can't believe yall call yourself pros yet you are using the dubs.
หนังนี้ลงทุนมากคะ
I think the VIP actors were shite in my opinion but the rest of the show was brilliant and if you haven't seen it yet then watch it in Korean with subs
Wow 🤩🤩🤩😍🤩🤩🤩🤩
7:30 "where so much magic was created." You should have used the clip of her in the stall with Deok-Su 😂

I'm glad that Asians are finally recognized for such a great show.
I kept hearing about it so I decided to watch Wow It's Compelling and It takes Yu to another world the Music Really captivates Yu Circus 🎪 music, Waltz Music,  and it  Draws Yu in I felt like them in the Red/Green light game BEWILDERED And Shocked 😲  it was So Well thought out, and Put together So Brilliantly! I became Hooked Because I Love how it takes us into their Lives, and Shows Why they Decided to Do this! And How they Managed to Overcome Every Obstacle to Stay in the Game Wow! When you start hearing about their Personal Lives you can't Help Root for your Favourite 👍🏻
Rengger merah nya ganteng banget ❤️😭
Hello
My favorite I’d honeycomb :D
My favorite game was Red Light Green Light, although all the games were amazing.  This was the best program/series that I have seen in a very long time.  Looking forward to Season 2.
idk why but who else thought squid game was real😭☠️🙌
heres my question               did 001 d^e?
Ñ
I'd join if it was real. I either walk away with bank or die... either way its a win win... not like I'd care about dying once I'm dead...
Green light red light
Can someone answer my question? So I checked on Google if Squid Game is really gory, and the answers weren't clear, and I don't like a lot of blood, so is the show really gory or not? Give me spoilers, I don't care
Really I played it in roblox
How did they do the blood?

I've watched Squid game over 3 times and even though I know Il-nam I think that's how you spell player 001s name but even though that hes the one behind all the games and a bad person I still cry when he "dies" 😅😭
Great👍👍👏👏👏👏👏
How about shoot them with taser , that make game more fun , you won’t die but you get hurt , the purpose of this game is to see fear and feel fear, not enjoy like other game
Pk ok

Who else cried a lot when the episode where they all played marbles??? I know I did. If you haven’t watch Squid Game yet, be sure to have a box of tissue. Please use the real actors voices. I/We don’t mind reading the English subs.

imagine not using the actual Korean audio or the names of the players people worked so hard to bring to life
Do they actually kill people
Little bit scary
at the giant doll it came from the philippines
The voiceover really lacks the energy of the original voices
So beautiful
who the fuck actually watch a show dubbed?
Downvoted because shorts from the show were dubbed. Sorry I just had too, no amazing show deserves their culture to be stripped by dubbing
I don't know how some people are able to watch it in dub 💀 It's so irritating
https://youtu.be/7TJn6mtbV6U
IF WE WIN JUST HOW MUCH WE GET
what an annoying narration
Just me or does this Chantal look Chinese/Korean just by the logo
cool
The voiceover dubbing 💀
Wait people watch this in english??
السلام عليكم 👋 محتوى جديد حياكم الله 🙋
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Corona who???
How dare they use the dub
What does “they were actually made out of the same material as tunnels” mean??
For dead people coffin dance with guard hehe
This reminds and calms me down that it isn’t real and everyone is ok😉
Ew the voices of the dub version is terrible
Ew why did they put it in english
Public info from multiple sources on Google say that the door was a prop made for the movie, briefly displayed at the museum, and is now put away in storage. Might want to correct that...
Do they really die?
People really die?
I bet you when they blurred the gun they said: Haha can't show that or else we will get demonized 🙂
No one  Litterly no one Me.Their costumes are really cool
No one  Litterly no one Me.Their costumes are really cool

I really liked this series and I hope it will be there a second part 😁😸🧡
No hablo Taka Taka

Are there any Sang Woo fans? 😁
I play red light green light on Roblox and sometimes a guy sometimes I don’t care he looked it up on Google and it was so scary so I’ve never watched it before and I’m never gonna watch it but I love Red light Green Light😊😊(:

One question why is it english?
Does anyone thinks its just a Korean version of the Bollywood movie named 'Luck'?
when your mom decides to cancel your netflix prescripsion
Squid games and white lotus are the best two show I've come across in a LONG time.
wow seriously I had never seen that behind the camera 😇
Asians are not into cgi. This is different to hollywood. Hardwork is an identity in Asian culture. That's what makes it appealing.
Movie name please

Awesome Netflix series. Binged the lot. 🐹🐽🐭
Never show me the dubbed version again! 😤
My ears are bleeding from listening to the show dubbed
👌👌👌👌👌🌟🌟
Woww the dubbing english is already on there?
ASIAN POWER
Anything Korean is great! 👌
Hollywood has money but wants to save it and not waste time and energy hiring too many people by using the modern way CGI. South Korea also has money but is more willing to spend it to make the story come to life. I see the difference.
Apakah Ada season 2 nya?
Mantap !

This is why it took 10 years, got it.

GUYS SALUTE TO THE DIRECTOR HE IS A GENIUS😍😍😍
Hrvati dismo
They went all out yet ended the show as an anime cliche
The older lady with curly hair kinda ruined the show for me. She was too over-the-top with her acting and it didn’t feel natural. I guess maybe it’s the cultural disconnect between the west and Far East Asian

👍❤️😀😘
ew not the dub
You chose the cringey English dub? Sad.
:D
It's so refreshing to see fully constructed sets instead of CGI (I know some of it was CGI, but that's unavoidable). Well done to everyone who worked on this amazing show 👏
Chúng tôi luôn chờ đợi hậu trường của Trò chơi con mực
It is very good movie,i liked it !
The dub really didn’t do it just IMO
Plz watch the show in Korean with English subtitles 💀 the English dubbed voices are so bad 😂
Voice over:  “The actor that played # 1 had a really intense nostalgic reaction when he was on set where the marbles game takes place”   Player #1:   “I once played marbles so it reminded me of the past”   Me: How intense 😂😂😂
Me thinking that the blood in red light green light was real: *c o n c e r n*
I wish someone would talk bout the old man vs the main character how the old man had 4 Marbles and the main guy had 3 and then when they revealed the main guys hand again to show the old man died he had 3 and old man had main guy had 4. They had a slip up.
I’m happy is real sets and not mostly cgi. The actors did such a good job I forgot they were acting.
Haven't seen this yet. Came to see what all the hype is all about.
the dub sucks
If you watched the English dub you have lost all my respect
Dont worry about the actors theyre just acting not dying ok
It was really genuine and realistic even if they didn't use so much CGI which I love it😆
Please watch DP on Netflix. It’s the 2nd great movie I’ve ever seen ! 🤗
No entendi
All are in love of squid game😍😍
Why did they use the dub
So that's the ekting ok
What a good show!  There must be a second season because I still have so many questions.

Please use SUB video next time... LOL..it doesn't convey the emotions well :D
How they put fake blood tho
Imagine watching it dubbed and ruining part of what makes the show great with shitty voice acting....

I already know that I'm going to dress up for Halloween, since my school uniform is practically the same as the squid Game wardrobe, why not wear my uniform- 😺
We are still waiting for season 2 ooo
Not one goddamn superhero in sight
Keren ga sih kalau adaa tempat yang dibuat tema tema nya dari squid game... Soalnya lucu lucu banget dan bagis buat foto 🤣

I love the squid game  😍😍😍💝
People saying that is better to watch it with subtitles…. Me watching this like 4 times in different languages with subtitles 😂 . Well just so everyone know the translation audio is different everytime and yea some audio languages change the dynamic and how this is view. With that been said I really wish for season 2 😸
I was actually one of the actors in a guards suit. Sorry, I am using my son’s account.

english dubbed is terrible, watch it with the original voices
The reporter seems so astonished that people actually built real sets. Does she not know that that's how it used to be done all the time? The funniest line: "Some of the real sets look like they could have been created by computers!" What?! It's so real-looking it could be fake? It's real-looking because it's, uh, REAL!
Has anyone noticed that squid game came a few weeks ago and now it’s on roblox people made it in minecraft and other games
behind the set of squid game they just copy cat takeshi castle bro
NOOOO not you using the dubbed version for the clips... just nooooooo

you just said the stairs "add to the genius of the show"...but how? they add absolutely nothing relevant to anything, and you didn't find any correlations either
the hidden easter eggs make no sense with the plot. someone was cheating, and didn't even know about the images on the wall
hey anyone see there is a square circle and triangle hair clip on the dolls head?
Wtf is this dubbing😭😭☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️PAHAHGAGAJAJAJAJ
I hate 218 he betrayed Ali and killed 067
Not the English sub😭🤚🏻
I find it amusing that when western made movies and tv shows dont have a  diversified cast they are called racist and sexist but when you watch  media from Korea or China or Russia or anywhere else, its all the same  race.. no mixed or diversified cast...  what a bunch of bullshit.. this  show sucks anyway not sure what all the excitement is about.. Terrible  acting and rehashed old concept.. cough hunger games etc. Don't waste  your time with this racist garbage.
That's my first time hearing them in English and it's so bad 😂
When you run out of ideas on what movie to make
Bunu izleyen turkler bi kendini belli etsin Gd7doddgfudocmdycomr

I like the red light green light mostly the sound of the dolls voice, which is now my notification sound on my phone
Good👍👍

Here’s a Squid Game joke for yuz! https://youtu.be/R3Muaw5894o
Most view childhood as a safe time, that is why using childhood games really unnerves the viewing experience. It wouldn't have the same impact if they used adult games
Excelentes actores ❤️

comment if you watched it in korean 👍.
Как всё понятно, не могу прям, спасибо.

You can really see the quality when there are real sets and props rather than CGI all the time. I find too much CGI unwatchable
No entiendo ni madres

As someone who had to pause the marbles episode for 5 or 10 mins because of absolute heartbreak, I can understand the actor who played #1’s reaction lol
thats the 1st time i heard the dub 🤢
Gosh phew I tough of tug a war they died D:
The actors were really great! But I found the story to have too much violence and negativity, which is not my type
What's the song that plays at 4:09?
damn, master piece work of such a dedicated director and the show was mind blowing, examplerary and uniqueness that i got to witness for such a long time.
Hmm english dub is dumb.
1:09 she said "euphoric" not "fantastic"
The dub made me cringe :/
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
If Marvel would ever bought this series they would do everything in cgi.
HA!hhahahahhahahahah
why you kill people
El puente de cristal no es de niños
FUN FACT - Real people were killed to avoid the use of CGI too much. Hats off  to the dedication.
lmao yall missed the part where the guy pretended to eat the food with his spork (spoon fork)
I was pleasantly surprised
for God's sake speak in portuguese bro que sack
who tf watching this dubbed lol?
Yes! This is the last year of filming for the series on June to October 2020 with the cast and crew members. Until the release date is on September 17, 2021 in Netflix. #SquidGame #GreenLightRedLight #SugarHoneyCombs #TugOfWar #Marbles #GlassSteppingStone #KnifeFighting  I will have to get finish on the villainous Front Man / Hwang In Ho (Lee Byung Hun)
Dubbing the characters in the video clip with  English, is so mighty fu***** English of you.

Episode 3 ang pulis nakapsok galing
wow! cool! gamas!
There will always be a higher reward for practical filming over cgi. You get a different feeling for it and the results are often far better.
I like and enjoyed this film
Today I completed the series!! By taking a leave to school!! I am not joking tho 😂😂
Well yeah I didn't know this was behind the scenes
Did they actually die tho?
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

Мне интересно они реально убили их?
Only the old dude's identity caught me by surprise in the end. I thought he was the MC's father at first. but apart from that, the cop brother was obvious, etc etc. The main MC ending isn't realistic though.. no one is going to be so shaken or broken when you voluntarily went into the game knowing the stakes that all but one will survive. not to mention your dirt-poor life situation and daughters.
🙄😜
The english dub 😫
i didn't know how bad the dub was until now
I love your vids green light red light I have fun it's it's beautiful you been happy me 😍❤️😊🍥
I dislike it. Bcuz the way better with their actual voices with subtitles😌
This series is good but it's kinda overrated...
damn. they did a really bad job with that voice acting
too much squid games on youtube
Fun fact : when they remove the beds tthe walls behind the bed are actually answers for the game

In my opinion it’s the best series ever on Netflix. Incredible acting, great dialogues, amazing atmosphere. Can’t wait for season two .
Squid Game 4k  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq7GwXC2nd0
I'm exited seeing the marketing level of squid game. For me, It’s a great show. But I think Squid Game is being over hyped. People loves thriller genre but There are more show like squid game. It's marketing level is in another level🔥
2:19 HOLY SH!T.... The games were all mentioned there from the beginning... And this is what I call a MASTERPIECE !!!

The freaking doll creeps me out.

The movie is the greatest movie out there this year. But please watch it sub and not dub. I understand you cant understand what they're saying but it more respect for the creators, actors, and crew work hard for the film. All the voice actors who dub it didn't even put effort for the show.
Bagus sgt ker ni. More harm than good.
i was the doll more dall
the english dub was soo bad
Green light red light 🤧🔥
very exciting, tense,. make the audience curious about this film. steady trending right away
I'm Thailand. I like it very much.
Awesome
Everyone keeps talking about this series. I just cancelled my Netflix after Cobra Kai was done. Looks like I'm going to have to reopen my account just to watch this series. My curiosity is getting the better of me.

One thing, I wish I could've watched this before seeing all those hyped stuff about this show so that I can really feel every roles without thinking oh I already know that this one is gonna end up being betrayed and so on hmm.. but I enjoyed the show and the rich people, not all but most are like that!
It's cool
i no the character from sqiud game
Korean is Really Dominating with their Skills and Talent. Hats off to the writers and the whole cast for their amazing Performance in Squid Game
for the love of God, never ever ever watch dub asian movies(or any movies at all). please use subtitles. it does make a difference.
Wow what
Wawe la série un chef d'œuvre, incroyable j'ai accroché des les premières minutes, hâte la saison 2
What is with the korean Cinema.Every time I see a korean show it always surprises me. I m getting edicted to their shows.I just loved squid game.It was so thrilling and terrifying at the same time 🤩🥺

I've always been interested in what's behind the scenes. This did not disappoint. The sets are amazing and I would pay any amount of money to visit them  Unfortunately I live in the US :(
South Korean is already conquering the world through Entertainment, Foods and Fashion without us being aware of it. #ILoveIt ❤️🇰🇷 From:🇵🇭

I need to watch this show now
Awesome
I haven’t seen all of it but I was most excited by tug-of-war
I was in the vib bc  I almost got shot that was a nerf
Wait did the actors actually died!?
Squid game when they published it : *STONKS*
The dub is so weird
They wanna use computers for everything 🙄this was a good show becuz they actually built the set
I hate squid game
No te entendi ni vrga wey ni se ingles
I got A question  What if u signed up then u don’t want to play? Would they shoot you or something?
This is my new favorite show!
Hahaha that is soo cool
Kpop... kmovies... kseries... south Korean entertainment the best 🤩
wait do they actually die or not I’m so confused

I never thought that they literally would dubbed their voices, like lol. The original voices are better and with a subtitle i think it's enough.
I hate squid game
It’s so weird seeing all the green screens and stuff tbh 🤯🤯🤯
I would have never thought that this show would get as popular as it is.
Watch America try to copy this and amaricanize it.
Who tf watches this in English lmao
The english dub is the only bad thing about the show, it doesnt capture any of the feelings. If you havent wayched it yet, just stick with Korean with English subtitles
I heard that squid game took 10 years to make
This is awesome to be able to see my new favorite show behind the scenes because it felt SO real it's so hard to believe a BTS. 🤗 🖤 🦑
I liked the video Good feat
That's what she said
The dub is so bad.
I'm not fit for acting...I would die of laughter with those cameras in my face
Seriously, who watches dubbed...?
Green light red light in this game you will be tracing the shape if you crack it you will be out of the game next game you will be playing tug me:lol
3:20 Candidate for worst voice-over, EVER.
Amo esa serie
jesus christ… please use subbed footage, the dub is horrible
Ummm,
It is true that Korea is an Asian country, but that does not mean that Squid Game is a movie of an Asian country. This represents only the level of Korean movies, not Asia. You will find out what I’m saying by watching other Korean movies or dramas such as Parasite.
I immediately recognized that staircase the first time I saw it
Like si no entiendes los comentarios y el video xd😏
كل شي سووه بطل ماشاءالله ولا غلطه😯
what could of helped was no Eng DUB hahaha
Who
my ears have been disturbed after hearing the english dub🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢
but why are you using dub....
I want to rewatch it😍
I cried when the old man died I couldn't stop crying 😭
Selamat
I would have given this show a perfect score if it wasn't for the VIP actors. Other than them, everything was excellent.
This was very good, I watched all on the day it came out lol. But I stayed up till 2 am…
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHIII
Next-> SQUIRT GAME
Loved it! 🎮The Playstation shapes on the guards I'm sure was also not coincidence. Connecting old school gaming w/ a silent nod to how kids primarily game now
[wow]
why dubbed? 💀
Ali would be dead bc in the cookie game the cookie broke
Damn, dubbed really sucks.. lol
more gore the better make it saw games

Have a question what is the gun shooting fake
did they really just dub this show.........
I enjoyed Squid Game but I feel Money Heist was better. It kept me on the edge at every scene, whereas in Squid Game, certain scenes were not as spine chilling as people have claimed. The twist does take one by surprise in the end, but until then, it's the same old "play and/or get eliminated".
All the kids outside playing red light greenlight.......I hear them
한국 짱 오징어게임 짱ㅋㅋ
I think I am the youngest one that has watched this I was 6 to 8
I love it
why force us to see the stupid dub, LOL
I wonder if they tweaked it to make it English or they spoke English
They understood the assignment ✔️✔️✔️
Ok

South Korea has achieved another greatness in film making!!!! So glad that the world has finally recognized and accepted outstanding Asian films like Parasite and now this one!
This ruined my imaginations...I thought it was real.
Amazing movie!!! 👏👏👏👏👏
Red light green light sounds so cool and normal, in Brazil they translated this game to "fries 1 2 3"
Not them using the dubbed version..
Personally I hardly watch a series until the end so does movies, but with this series I was hooked. Great job to the crew. Love from South Africa
The coffins were inspired by blackpink
Squid game is like a big liminal spaces
The English version is so bad lmao
I thaught that this was all real 💀💀💀💀💀
How could you not watch it in Korean? Takes away from their fantastic acting.
Now tell me who the fuck watched it in English wtf

Is the squid game 16+
I cringe every time I see someone dubbing it into a diff language.... just use subtitles. Diff voices on the actors ruin the whole thing
Vay Bravo ıvatyl is Speed game
such a pity how some people choose to watch the dubbed version of the original … dubbed things are usually worse, but definitely more so for this show. The original actors captivated every emotion and word so vividly and beautifully, and it’s a huge reason why the show is so great.
I watched it in Korean, anyone else? I think it makes it more authentic.
Rosay
Wait there was an English dub version? I watched the whole season in Korean. With English subtitles.

We love it ❤😩
Dead of Ali is saddest moment. In this series , 😔😔😔
Alguém do Brasil?
I like to believe now that the part with the old man looking for his house wasn’t scripted and him just in awe haha
I haven't seen this series like a movie s
Pingin liat BTS (behind the scene) yg di toilet 😂
Escuchar a la muñeca decir Green light! Red light! le quita todo el chiste. Todavía en audio latino lo hicieron cantado.
euw...  watch it in original language
Movie doesn't make any sense........very stupid movie
I must admit I didn’t like it a my first just fast forward to the games but ended up watching the 2nd half of the series in it’s entirety can’t wait to see what happens in season 2
Game of Thrones: am i a joke to you?
Brush  squid game🤣❤🇰🇪i love this shit
哈都会
Not only in this drama. Korean productions don’t rely mainly on CGIs. They always create and invest their sets. They wanted that the actors would feel how is like to be in that world.
Ternyata seperti itu too.
ppl who watching the dubbed ver: 🤡
This show is so Good
Takut la
Do y'all know that look at the screen bottom where you back an app and you see the tap / back button is the same as the SHOW!!!
I love sqid gme
Diziyi 9 saatte bitirdim :)))
And I thought that only Germans were the issue with their dubbing..
حيل تعبو على تصميم نكان التصوير🧐
this movie absolutely spent a lot just only for the theme itself. how much more for the totality of the show. 🥰 incredible indeed!!
It’s so overhyped
해외에서 오징어 게임 난리다해서 해지했던 넷플릭스 재가입해서 봤는데 걍 9편 날밤 새서 한번에 다 봤음. 왜 전세계가 열광하는지 이해가 되더라...
what the fuck is that dub
Gosh the dub version is so weird to me 😭
I love this series 🥰from Kerala,India Malayaali 🔥🔥🔥🔥

Wong jowo sek nonton iki ☝
I cried when they played marbles like the most saddest scene ever, like at the starting it just doesnt look like that kind of show but in the last episodes... Just so sad and there is just so much suspense and like unexpected events... EVERYTHING and especially the acting of everyone... I love it!
Definition of stupid: having people wearing masks right next to people not wearing masks. The world has truly been dumbed-down. Nobody able or allowed to think for themselves anymore.
The english dub should be banned😭😭
BRAVO! Squid Game! All actors were great! impressive!
The fact that doll is real and on display will freak a lot of people out haha
All i hear is ssss
Wait..is the blood and shooting real? Did they really die........!??....😨💀
Her: hides gun pointed at person Also her:let's everyone see smgs
Why did you colour swap for your thumbnail? Screams of desperation 😂
This video would have been better if this women had not spoken in it.
There is a lot of people that die in red light green light
Bruh can u just not talk and show the behind the scene video?? Omg so annoying
그으린⤴️ ~ 라이트 ⤵️레드~라이트⤴️~
The bunk beds were also assembled in a way (staggered) to appear like they’re audience seats in a coliseum because you watch people fight to the death in a coliseum (traditionally).
Can’t believe I’m saying this but it’s very weird watching the series in English voices xD
Your lying if this is not the best series you have watched yet.

All the people who watch anime in Japanese can all agree with me that it's only right to watch this series in Korean with English subs, I'm not gonna lie I struggled watching it in English

Wow 🤩
The English dub is so weird 🧍🏽‍♀️I would rather just read subtitles 😭
Series Asowm
English dub is ok.. but dubbing can never justify for the original one.. specially the red light green light song, the intensity of emotions (thank you, for playing with me) and all. Even though I'm not korean but i have been into kdrama and kpop since a long time. So, yeah if you watched it in dub that doesn't count, do watch it in original sound with subtitles. That will make you feel watching it first time
It’s such a great and terrifying feeling that you realize u can relate to at least one character in the show when it comes to a life death situation.
Red light green light
Loved every bits of the episodes

Green light red light
Opo iyo neh
Lmao why would they use the dubbed
My heart fluttered hearing your pronunciation of "moogunghua". Encourage you to continue pronouncing things correctly :) even a slightly bit of effort goes a long way.
Fun fact, they messe up the german Translation, the doll says "red light, greeen light" then turns instead of "green light, red light"
oh no l do not know
sheeeeeeeeeeeesh xD
This show got so popular because humans love violence. If it didn't have any violence it wouldn't even people be talking about it... remember the romans keep people happy by violence...
Uau 🤯🤩
I dont understand the hype but ok. xD
i was excited and terrified of the first game and the last game both nice and scary
اكثر مسلسل يجيب الطاقه السلبيه
the fact that the clips are in dub makes me feel extreme unbridled rage
I dislike hearing the creepy theme music but after awhile it grows on me.
The fact that someone actually watched this with an English dub. A crime...
역시 우리나라 짱
Well I can say this series has some originality I didn’t expect the old man to betray us

I hope you can display Indonesian subtitles
You know I kind of feel like they should make a Lego squid game

I feel like squid game is like sort of another version of kaiji
Is the doll actually real or its fake?
Just finished watching SG. It's absolutely fantastic, the actors were incredible, the sets were amazing. Just so so good!
Show the stairs scene to a bathmophobic.
2:35 I'm sorry but how the fuck are beds made out of the same materials as _tunnels_ like you mean the minerals and ores we dig out of tunnels, metal? No shit? but why say it like that?
I did not actually notice those drawings on the dorm wall
Why do I think maybe they will make a attraction Park of it that would be cool (and possible)
Imagine watching this dubbed...yikes
dIDTHE PEOPLE REALLY DIE?

Justice for Ali😭💔
Giant doll is very scary 😅😨😰
What’s wrong with y’all watching English dubbed 🤢they sound terrible and emotion less.
Did the other players actually died?
Did you guys knowin movie showed about stolen organs of dead human but in real life china communist took organs of innocent people who practitioners meditation named Falun Dafa ! Please wake up In real life and be careful with china ccp
The 3.2k dislikes are from people pissed at them for using the dubbed version

Ali :(
yeah I still don't get why people are obsessing over this show. Who didn't play red light green light as a child why is everyone acting like squid game made it up 🙄 . Do have to say though those sets looked very interesting.
Lol did people actually watch this masterpiece with the cringy dubbed audio instead of watching it in Korean with subtitles?
So all these times they were just acting? Nobody really died?
한국인 없어요??
Ok but the dubbed version💀💀
Nice!.
Dub sounds horrible
uzun zamandir hic bu kadar cok kapilmadim bir diziye cidden, kesinlikle iyinin de iyisiydi dizi
What
2:35 hmmm yes the tunnels here are made of tunnels
Did your editing team watch the English dub??? Because why are you guys using the horrible English dub 😭 it's so trash.
the english dub makes me so uncomfortable omfg
💜👌👍😮
I’m a youTuber
They definitely really put a hard work on this series … so happy it’s turns up to be so good and amazing ..
Y'all gotta stop hating on dubs. They're there for a reason
As a Producer, I cringe that the budget for extras in Squid Game must have been massive lol
for God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.
The VIP episode crushed the quality of the series.. their dialogues were crappie and cheesy! Why why why???
Japanese and korean always make the best movies
The doll is real?
Gblk njr
My favorite scene is the candy licking part! LoL! Squid game is pretty intense and so I’m glad that the director had some funny part in the drama.
Gi Hun Fans 🔥🔥👍
Korean films doesn't give the audiences the satisfaction of a fair ending but inspite of that, they are impeccable in invoking storyline surprises.
Is the big doll like alive like a robot I don't wanna go near it cause I think it will shoot lol
좋은 촬영
Good content this channel
Hats off
Love from kerala 💓   squid game😍
I think from a acting perspective, the glass bridge is the scariest. Even know its safe, stepping a glass that breaks is still scary as hell. Then tug of war is second scariest
I wanted to see the glass break behind the scenes
Green light dead light

The dub version made me cringe. One sentence and I changed it to the Korean version. The reactions of the actors is much better and natural in the Korean version.

Did people realy die and get hurt?
I loved squid game
😅😅😅😅
I really likes the episodes, but they did so much work for it to be just one season, they should have made more seasons for all the work they put into it
Bro this show is amazing
Omg thank God that is not real lol
First time I heard it in dubb🤦🏽‍♀️and good grief
"ESTOY TOTALMENTE SEGURO QUE LA PERSONA QUE SE DETUVO A LEER ESTE MENSAJE SERA EXITOSO EN TODO LO QUE HAGA" ❤️🥺.

Bye the way who is Arturo Roman in here🤣🤣

My teacher showed me that picture
OMG instant regret clicking on the video when I heard the dub....... 아니요!!혐오스럽다
Why would you use the dubs? Honestly…
Imagine the old man was genuinely reminded of his childhood home and got lost within the character 😩😩 in still heartbroken about what he did to us, but he’s such a good grandpa at heart to dislike 🥲
I can’t imagine how nostalgic the actors felt filming this.
😍😍😍😍😍😍
I hope this wins an Oscar
dubbed versions are a joke. please just use subtitles
why does this keep showing
A human
I saw something with pigy bank
Doll: RED LIGHT   Me: Green light. OOO everyone is dead
not the English dub 😭😭
Best movie so far they played that role really good my favorites🙌🏻😍😍🙌🏻
Who the heck watched it with English dub 😂😂😂😂 that $hit sounds like it sucks
Imagine if squid game was and American movie-
the giant doll is so cute
omg so good
Did a high schooler write the narration?
I love how the actors just act themselves instead of a different persona all real emotions by such amazing actors 👏🏼
she watches dub lol
I’ve never watched squid games but here I am 😭
This movie is lit but people very overpost to their social media and that's disturbing for me.
This Director is top notch.!
só o grosso estralando
I always hate it when people say something like "Japanese Dub is better" or "Korean Dub is better" imo. Like, yea, it's great since you can see the emotions of the characters more, but there are still people who prefer English Dub bc they don't want to read the subtitles or other reasons.   For me, I like English dub bc I'm always busy with my school works, so I pick English Dub so that I don't waste my time just rewinding and re-reading the subtitles if I watched the shows in Korean Dub or even Japanese Dub.   If I don't have an option for English Dub, then I just have to pay attention to the show instead of my work, cuz reading the subtitles and all. So pls, shut up with the opinions. You may have a lot of people who agree with you, but there are still others who don't agree with you. It's getting annoying.
The more deadly the movie is, the more fun it is to act
Green light red light
People watched with the English voices? I watched with the subtitles and feel it was 100x better that way
The glass bridge scene was insane! 👁👄👁
I knew that the stair place was made from that picture I had a great feeling.

Really wish you hadn't used the English dub  for B roll 😕
We need season 2 now!!
Still glad I ain't watched it😂

English voice acting was so damn good without subtitles
Imagine watching it in English looooool the dubbing is second only to the actual western actors in the show
eh why use the dubbed version,  no one watched it dubbed
Do they actually die
Did you help squid game
Is the gun real?
Korean sounds way better
The "s"s you say is hurting my ear. It might be your mic. It sounded too sharp.
Best movie on netflix rn!🔥🔥

its really col how there was actually 400 performers
Eww why did u make the cuts of the show in English, try appreciating the original
The bunkbeds was said to represent the struggle to climb the ladder and going through a lot of stuff.
I enjoy this s Show!!!
Just realize English dub sucks 😭
Que barbaridad
Squid game vai ficar marcado pra sempre na história.o drama esta se explandindo e sendo comentado mundialmente
South Korea does it again. If this is the only SK stuff you’ve seen, you’ve been missing out. Lots more out there. This was very good and lives up to the rest of the amazing cinematic masterpieces South Korea has produced.
That what I was watching last night so many people dead
yall cant read subtitles? shame.
jesus christ is that actually what the english dub sounds like ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
I loved this show
Bro all these ppl saying things about koreans or asians like that has anything to do with why the show is good. Have you ever thought maybe humans are humans and the ones responsible for this show did amazing. Stop race baiting
The most hyped GARBAGE on TV right now.  If you want to be BRAINWASHED by Asians who think they have moral superiority, keep looking at these programs.
how does the winning tug of war team hold the losing tug of war team when they fall off the edge ? LOL Korean physics . Why cut the rope ? The winning team would not be able to hold them at all .
that’s what i love about the korean entertainment industry. they don’t dare use a green screen. even in the music videos all of these are designed sets and i just love the realism and dedication.
This isn’t Splatoon?
People that use to watch korean dramas didnt get that impressed like everybody else. They always overtop and the highest  level when it comes to production and acting
If I see another raid shadow legends ad 🙁
It's not often an Asian production catches my eye. Most of the ones I grew up watching were around martial arts and very violent movies. This is the first TV series I watched and it absolutely needs a series going around who are the mysterious group that funds the games around the globe.
Green light red light green light red light
Do not translate.  Just enjoy Korean and dubbing.  This is better.
Coool
This video is just a one by one copy of the interview they did with the writer/ directer, actors and creative directors but in a “I did not watch it “ way
episode 6 tho 😔

Glad im Korean :)
Red light!       Green light!
Tem brasileiro aí? 💪🇧🇷
Yall MUST WATCH NEXT: DP, Kingdom, Sky Castle, Mr Sunshine, Itaewon Class, Sweet Home, Extracurricular, My Mister (no lovestory), Crash Landing On You (romcom), The World of the Married.  This is even a good order to start by 🤔😉

This series was meant for this Generation

나는 최근에 오징어 게임을 보았고 그것을 좋아했습니다! 비하인드 스토리를 볼 수 있어서 너무 좋습니다.
Am I the only one who isn't interested in watching this serie? 🤔
Its was a big difference of course bc of CGI.
woooooooow "claps hands"

I didn't even know that dubbed version was an option to watch it in... hearing it for the 1st time here and it's super cringe lol
oh im surprised this is dubbed?? is that normal for non-english shows?
Lol ta mère
Bro Lets fucking goooooooo
It is a refine version of the movie “LUCK" a bollywood movie...but this drama has more impact...
no ma'am that's not usa where all the fucking things are made in cgi, in other part of the world still using scenography with tangible material
Eeeewwww why watch it dubbed? Is it so hard for Yankees to read subtitles?
Love this show
Please don’t watch the dubbed version, it ruins it.
Why did you use the English DUB

세트 진짜 잘만들었지
squid game is very similar to donganronpa
G ngerti bahasa Inggris
I loved it! It's such an artistic show!
This is cool and all but the DUB is so painful to hear 😫 I didn't even know that they made a dub for this like why would anybody watch foreign movies with dubs??
Jj
God the English dub sounds terrible
for gods sake, watch this in korean...........
I feel like if this movie was real, you would definitely notice the drawings on the walls after being in there for a minute and wonder what they mean. And after the 1st or 2nd game would realize it’s all the games drawn on there. It’s so odd that the whole time they never even had a clue
3:45 The fact they blured out the gun (no hate)
I actually enjoyed watching it in English, yes watching media with original audio is ALWAYS the best experience, especially live action dubbing never really looks and sounds great since you can obviously hear the difference between a mic on set, and a mic in a studio. There's no depth to it. But for me personally I just don't like it when I see people speak and don't understand a single word. In media I mean, And it makes me focus way more on the subs, and thinking about how some lines sound longer and the sub line is way shorter. Its just way to distracting to me. I was glad there was an english dub and I just watched this while also playing a game, so I didn't get annoyed by the lips not syncing right because that should drive anyone insane. I think I only switched it to korean in red light green light, since the doll just says "green light red light" in english and the way it sounds in korean is more creepy imo. But I enjoyed the voices and I enjoyed the show, even though the dub isn't the ultimate way to experience it. Glad I got to experience it how I wanted to experience it
Green light red light!!
This show deserves all the hype!
*after watching Squid game, make MONEY HEIST look so amateur. sorry*
Watched this series and i must say subtitl3s is the wayvto go so you can really feel the actors emotion etc.
me when many Americans don't tolerate reading subtitles and don't watch anything unless it's in English 🙄   people have been judged for watching Kdrama for years, prejudices related to that are many and this is not the first Kdrama it's just one that happened to become very popular, just like anime has been judged by many until they watch Attack on Titan for example and that blows up. Support those communities especially now if you're new to this!
Gгееn light геd light
Man I just finished whole episode within 14 hrs 😂🤣. Good Series. Lot's of emotions 😁. It made me cry
May i point out they blur a handgun but not all the other guns
Bugged that they showed the dubs lol
Now I really wished I was in squid game 😭
1:08 Woow what a deep quote you put just right there
In the movie i wanted 067 to win but she got murdured in the movie
yay
wat?
They made the stairs bc of a dutch artist UwU
Okay
Please don't watch it in dubbed. Subbed is much better and conveys their hardwork they did.
Did people actually watch Squid Game dubbed..? It's not the first video I see where the scenes are dubbed, what's the problem with reading subtitles?
I love how they didn't use cgi for red light green light. They provided some quick jobs/money for so many people.
Los que no entendieron ni caca xd 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
The English voice actors need work it was very cringe original is much much better
we couldnt just use the scens in korean?

Green light........ red light!

The Squid Games goes to Shows you that Money is the Root of all Evil.
But how do they die tho
In season 2 hide and seek would be very good or tag or duck duck goose

CGI just used now
I’m waiting for behind the set
SQUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUID GAEM ;)
Cool

Hey
I noticed  the images  on the wall from the beginning....so they actually  didn't  need to get hints like they did ...they just needed to know how to play the ones on the wall well.lol
Imagine if one of the actor/actress left their phone during lunch break can got lost in that gigantic set LOL ….
I was excited by the glass game because im a glazier and the fact that one of the caracter had work in a glass shop made me see myself in the game (even if he didnt made it)... it was a great touch since its never represented in movies.
Subbed…
The dubbing 🤢🤢 What a turn off.
In our world today with many predictable and reapetedly movies, born movies like this...sallute to all people in this movies.. .I watched 1-9 episode in 1 night after work I can't wait tomorrow to continue watching...
red light. ZA WARUDO
I think i also saw honeycomb from running man

Never watch dubs instead of subs
The doll is from a kid book in Korea
Episode 6 was the hardest to watch, the game really showed their true character when they had to play 1 on 1 and look the devil in the eye in order to win
I love the movie that they make all rate it 10/10
I really like Squid Game, I hope it goes viral, the spirit of the squid game team
My question is when they die in green light red light how dose the blood come out they mouth if the movie fiction
U work there?
Get nominated for oscar already!! C'mon
My friend thought they actually died 😂😂😂😭✋
Omg
I love this show but I hate the English dubs 😒 if you are going to watch this show you should watch it in Korean
The best example for young movie maker.
The ending of every game is so predictable.
Lüñg my dë
It's way more unsettling when kid stuffs are paired with violence. It's really really scary when you put innocence and violence together.
The first game should be named "move and die"
amazing process
Woohoo
Love the behind the scenes but am annoyed that they chose the dubbed version to show in clips -_-
These English dubs 😣 nails on a chalkboard lol
Nah ur a sinner for watching it dubbed 😔
POV: You r watching thease before watching the squid game.
The dub 😭😭😭
Squid game was sooo interesting to watch❤️watched whole season in few hous
Every element of this series is amazing, everyone involved with the project should’ve so proud of everything they’ve accomplished
Forever remembered film until the end of world. whenever u see Green Light / Red Light on road signals 😂.
This show was just in time - to the writer who never gave up since 2008, Sir you brought the world a masterpiece that'll live long to be enjoyed.
I am Asian and I am proud for our continent to make this masterpiece!
Wow
Long live the k-wave. 🇰🇷
No to see  thesse serie
Wait I just realized I still don’t know why the police officer was killed by his brother?
ok lets be honest you just got all these clips from another video.
Though the concept was cool but i thought it was really boring. Don't get the hype haha
Is it true that they die like in real life???
Movie was lame asf y’all just so hyped cause this the biggest thing since covid 😭😭😭😭😂😂
I know where the arm of the dollars it's in the museum of the squid game to check major have another already told that they're making
korean art department are really good.. i first appreciate it through BTS mvs and performances where they even re-create the set of Grammys.
Lee Jung Jae is a master of ad-lib (improvisation during filming) as well.  When he met SaeByuk the first time (bumped into her holding milk) he ad-libbed putting the fallen straw back into the milk and SaeByuk actress hides her face to avoid a retake (she's laughing like crazy)
So you’re telling me, no one died?
Loved this
I love them so much<3
Oo
if hey stop but... if you not to stop you will died if she see you move
Green light and red light was cool
People in my country are prejudiced against Korean people, and then they start watching this show, and I'm very proud of myself. 💖💖
Only Asian film making can take it to this level these days I think. In North American theatres, all I see is Marvel movies or typical gunfight scenes in recent years. I'd rather stay at home to watch Asian dramas and movies from Netflix and Amazon Prime.
Tug of war
Uhh?
who the fuck watches this dubbed? huge discredit to the amazing performances done by all the actors
Why do i feel like i keep hearing the same thing that this video summarised literally within the first minute
In my opinion this series is overrated
I see you Sangwoo. 🙄👍
7:42 thats what she said
The doll is from Totoro
i really love this movie interesting.
오
Ethupole thrill adippichcha oru cinema🤒🤐🥴🥵
I would play such a game)
This deserved an award
who tf listens to dubs man 🤮
Can't wait for season2 😭😭
😃😃😃😃😃😮
Great film 🔥🔥
THAT IS so! Cool
Kapan ya film indonesia bisa dikenal dunia kaya gini, sad
it was very disappointing to see the glass shattering scene was one of the few scenes that was made with shitty cgi  and the plot twist that the girl was stabbed with a piece of glass was even more disappointing because the whole thing about this game is that it was supposed to be fair for all players ... felt unfair for the girl :/  but i loved how the guy stabbed himself at the end instead of terminating the game ... feels so in character .. he'd rather someone win than no one winning great series tbh but they missed up a couple of times
So nobody gonna talk abt the VIP and the police? -
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4MYgqyaqAIY
🦅
Dang it, i want them to die
Why are so many people mad about the English dub lmao Not everyone can read the subtitles entire time
hahahah the english dub HAHAHHAHHA
Asian people are good to make movies, they know how to entrertain you.
Were they actually dead
Ngl the comments saying “kOreAnS aRe sO tAlEnTeD” sound kind of silly…..did y’all think they lived in straw huts before or?? 💀
Team corporation fentastic 😜
3:44 lol - and that's what's wrong with the US
The fact you used the eng dub 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮. Auto dipping out. Original is better
I'm not watching this video purely because you used the dubbed version instead of the original and just subtitled.
Man, episode 6 (the one where they play marbles) is not only one of the most sad things I've seen but also one of the most beautiful. I LOVED the golden hour look of the town that was built! So warm and soothing
I know am not the only one finish the whole season in one day ....
This series make history of korian movie industry 🤗
Lol they should watch this in Korean language to feel the emotions.
The english version of Squid Game makes me want to punch something 😠
Who else watched this in Korean but with English subtitles?
Behind the set? So, like facing a wooden wall where the set is on the other side?
I thought that i wouldnt be able to watch it cause i only watch shows in english.but now that i watch  the video and hear the english narrationing i have problems with it.i much rather have it in korean
I have watched the whole series 3 times now . I’m obsessed. Best thing Iv seen in a very long time .
I knew the staircase looked like an art I’ve seen
this show is just so amazing
Thats a very very biggest spoiler. Why dont writing
Squid Game And 900$ Or MrBeast And 500000$
the tug of war scene was the main location that really impressed me, granted some of it was cgi but it was one of the best scenes (out of many)
The way they handle everything and the way they act it's 🤩
Good working man👍
That staircases remind me of La Muralla Roja (Calpe)
Ngomong opo to kihhhh
Revision!!! Revision!!! Revision!!! 🙌🏽💯🔥 https://youtu.be/HbUCMTpNTBQ
Green red
Honestly, the English-dub version didn't do the acting justice. The raw emotion in the voices of the original cast in the Korean version is SO POWERFUL. Obviously some people rely on audio description/can't read subs, but for anyone who CAN they really need to watch the original rather than the dubbed version.
Bruh I thought red light green light was filmed in a base ball place/:
This is World's best hit So Far.....ngl
Hahaha idk Americans watched this dubbed. Hahaha
I love sqiud game ❤❤❤❤❤
Who the hell watch squid game with eng dub lol
Yes!!!  Humanise this ish for the psychopaths at the back!
Wowwwwww👍🏻🥺💗🌷
the dub sounds so bad
Did anyone else watch the show or cry? Like if you did!💜👍
Nhái
Why would u watch it in English dub just go watch English shows why watch k-drama in English dub🙄
세트장 진짜 잘만듦
Bts ruined the intense scene 😭
2:50           *gekoloniseerd *
GREEN LIGHT!💚……………..RED LIGHT!❤️
Nice article...
Mirip kaya film the hanger
Dubbing sucks.
Mana nih indo, biasanya menuhin komentar paling atas
Less talking and more background videos please
I finished entire Season 1 in 12 hours!
In about third episode I called it, that the old man ruled the whole thing. Watching the SAW series I remembered how I got the same vibes from this non the less Korean masterpiece. Well done, hope to see second season soon.
THIS SHOW IS GREAT I LOVE IT! the English version is so weird I'd recommend watching it in Korean with English subtitles
Squid game 🥳🥱
all the scenes are so nostalgic! like if you agree
I'm triggered that they use dub
children bouta go to the playground seeing blood man
The dub is such bs, watch it in korean language with subtitles guys
Stop talking
WoW
Can’t believe this series was rejected for 10 years
Finding out these were real sets blew my fucking mind
NOT THE ENGLISH DUBBED LMAOOOO

I'm a simple man, and I prefer subs over dubs.
The dubbed...I can't. 😂😂 If you want the realness of it all, you have to watch it in Korean. Overall, great series. Very reminiscent of older animes/mangas like Kaijin and Liar Game.
Как же плохо не знать английский.  Дети, учите язык!)
This is the best series I’ve ever watched
I love the colorful scenes

Squid game😍😍
Absolutely loved it!!
Damn        I wanna travel there!
So you're telling me that actors didn't play tug of war over a 50ft drop?
why yall watch the dubbed version????
I didn’t want to watch this because it looked to violent for me but my husband put it on and wow we loved it. And finished it in a day. Amazing show!
idk but it's boring
4:47 cameraman playing red light green light 😳
Makowa koshi piri samida idkkk
Hmmmm.....squid games! It is fascinating to watch the games played so well with befitting designs  The biggest drama of my life. The glass game freaked me out, which turns out to be real, expect they did not die. I will pass out if am on that set!!
.
the best
Best show out there
Fgvvhvjghg
Gzhfuxt,
When was there a game that you had to jump on a piece of glass and hope it doesn't break.
sayang bgt set nya kalo ga dibikin Season 2 *edisi maksa🤣
Good job Good job 👏
Green light red like 123
This show is a rare example where every aspect of it was great and it was somehow better than the sum of it's parts
I got goosebumps
It's so cool, K-dramas can compete globally👏👏👏
Must be very awkward being with 4 hundred people in 1 room with 5 extra people who are the pink security + the manager of the games
Octopus Game
Fuckin ew. Who actually watched this in english???
How did they make the organ though..
I watched an interview with the arts director and she said the bunk beds are actually designed to look like the stands in a stadium and the shelves in a warehouse, like the players are being 'stored' as objects
the dub 🤮🤮🤮🤮 please listen to the original with subs — soo much better
Omg
The fact that they even made the robot and set fr is dedication
My heart will break if there is never a season 2. I wanna watch more.
Wow
sus light sus light
That would be scary if the whole world had to do that
PONGAN SUBTÍTULOS EN ESPAÑOL!!!
The stairs reminded me of cattle walking to their slaughter. They put them in a maze and play music….it really set the tone for whats to come EDIT: people are talking about the bad sub and it honestly wasn’t that bad. I had to watch it bc my parents are old and can’t real subtitles well. After the first 3 eps, the dub version gets pretty good randomly lol I’ll watch it again in Korean, but the show was still amazing in English
Imagine watching it in dub, yall weird.
this is the saddest scene of squid game: https://youtu.be/oy3gn-hSLfg
Soooo cool!!
https://youtu.be/oy3gn-hSLfg
At first everybody wouldn't stop talking about squid game I didn't watch it but after  I finished the season and asboultey LOVEEE this show
El comentario en español q esperabas xd
It's so awkward hearing the dub after listening to it sub lol
I like that the doll is back in its original amusement park. I imagine it's going to be the backdrop for a lot of selfies. I hope she still sings the creepy song.
Yeah welcome to k-dramas lol
Y'all said it wasn't CGI
The lesson for this is money cant buy happines
Why We Won’t Survive Squid Game in “Real Life” https://youtu.be/crm1X6_m5ZY
i love saebyok
If he had choose red he had been some of the shooters
Yes i love this
I’m not even gonna lie but hat one scene with the marbles broke my heart and I cried! And I barley cry
They did all of this for a show? That’s a little hard to believe
girl….. a BUDGET.
This voice over is so annoying
Wawq
can there for once be a video which doesnt explain a fucking thing like im 3 ?
When you want to watch youtube videos but Havent finished the season and Don t want spoilers
Interview : how did you feel about your experience ? Actors : Yes
Why would you even replay these scenes dubbed? If you want the true experience, play it in original language with subtitles if needed
Kdramas that are nothing like Squid Game but still on Netflix that I recommend: My Mister, Kingdom, Itaewon Class, Hotel Del Luna, Vincenzo, Mr Sunshine
So are the ppl who died alive still?
I love how everyone is like WOW THE ASIANS DID SO GOOD I LOVE THE ASIANS OMG THE ASIANS DESERVE AN AWARD. Like bruh calm down and quit bringing race up please my god
seeing this just makes me even more happy that this show blew up like it did bc ever since I seen behind the scenes of shows it makes me think about how much work ppl do to make these shows the way they are, Squid Games is incredible 💜🦑🎮🎲
English dub. 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
This narrator makes sweeping , generalized statements that provide no new or useful information to the viewer. What a horrible review, for an incredible film.
The Relativity was so cool because if you jump to the sky you will be back in there
I absolutely LOVED squid game. The suspense, the acting, the attention to detail, it was all AMAZING to me. Ngl I kinda expected “hide and seek” to be one of the games just because it’s one of the most popular games worldwide to play as a kid. But who knows? Maybe they’ll add it in Season 2 (assuming there is one).
People watched this show with english dub? Ew. Go watch it again with subtitles..
Reasons why u have low subs:you ruin the movies
4:27 did i see a shape like II? Guard?
This show was honestly one of the best things I’ve watched on Netflix, everything seemed so real in it and I started to some how have a connection with the main characters
5:35
Dub is horrible
i like the show
Very Good 👍
Iam in the game too
พล็อตเรื่องมันก็เหมือนหนังเเนวนี้เรื่องอื่นๆ เดาได้เเม้ไม่อยากเดาว่าสุดท้ายจะฆ่ากันเองเหลือเเค่คนเดียวเเต่สิ่งที่เขาเน้นไม่ใช่เกมเเต่เป็นเรื่องราวชีวิตของตัวละครเเต่ละตัวมากกว่า เเละที่ทำให้คนนิยมน่าจะเป็นทุนเดิมที่เป็นซีรีย์เกาหลี เเละเกมที่เป็นการละเล่นของเด็กอาจจะทำให้คนดูย้อนวัยไปคิดถึงตอนเด็กที่เคยเล่นโดยเพาะฝั่ง เมกา ยุโรป
I've been into Asian shows since I was 5 in 1975. I vividly remember watching Ultraman and Space Giants. This show just helps seal my love for Asian cinema/TV. Parasite was also brilliant.
awesome
Just got done watching  the first season.I can't wait until season 2.
The Squidward Game.
Jm
i noticed how the stairs looked a lot like the relativity art thing and thought "that's odd"... now i know why😂
highly recommend,,,,,   Netflex Sub : My mister !!!!!   King of the KDrama!!!
Green Light or Red Light.....it doesn't matters if you have a bmw.
I love squid game
👋
Red light green light was the best game 💀
He’s 456 at end when he got the money at the bank I think his pin was 4.5.6
I miss those days in 80-90th film sets when they build the scene and it looked awesome. I appreciate the work they put in this without too much computer magic and green screens, which kinda gave me that feeling watching a good movie/serie and of course after 1-2 episodes I had to see all of it. And it was good and enjoyable
What a hard work !
Showing dubbed version……. FAIL!
Hey guy ! My name is Ray and I’m just new to YouTube and want to say hi to the world 😁
I dont get of how people are hating on Squid game I also wont forget the time mom said she saw a big border infront of her (she called me)
fun
Great movie I even forgot about the violence in it… my brain and heart was focused on this poor people trying to survive all for money 😭😭
You can either like it or hate it, but you cant deny the succes it has
Watching Squid game in korean with subtitles made it way more sadder and creepy and i just felt their emotion wayyyy more
Did people watch the show dubed into english?
ONE OF THE BEST SERIES IN NETFLIX!!!!!!! THE BEST!
Please dear god if you watch it use subs not the English dub it’s so bad !!!!!
I’m proud to be a Korean
This movie is the best now
Sounds like a plan to me. This is where it starts
Little CGI
Thumbnail fake
Omg
I do not understand the squid game is not Asian it’s Korean lol wtf I’m confused
Even the camera person had to play red light green light!
Ffffffffff
Squid game is rated MA who watched it I’m seven with my sister that’s five
Season 2 coming soon https://youtu.be/QtBDL8EiNZo
The english dub had me rolling on the floor💀
3:04 this reminds me of Harry Potter
YOU DID NOT PUT THE EANGHLIS DUB!!!!!
Tanpa kita sadari kita melakukan game ini
Wow! 😮
Am I the only one who enjoyed the jazz song the most?
4:25 can we talk why the guy on the right has a pause symbol on his mask?
The old man and the pakistan was the saddest to me ,then i found out the ole man was behind it.even thou he was ful of life
One world order Future planning showing in this series thats not just entertainment show its reality  like Covid19 agenda
I knew those are dolls !!!!!!!
I watched this video so funny! And feel  very proud to my country 🇰🇷   Especially for me I really love it. Cuz I did those game when I was young. For example Squid game, they said that game has played long times ago in Korea, but well I don't think so Cuz I played squid game actually 10 years ago with my friends at my elementary school's playground lol😏  If you guys grown up at Korea, or you guys were Korean, you can understand this drama more deeply!  During watching this video, I felt that I really want to play those games one more time. Especially...   무..궁화..꽃..이...피었습니다- !
Real
The person who came with idea jah knw its fascinating scenes r too
Iam gonna be brief : Koreans are good at everything they do
olí bbs
But I have many questions. How did they get the glass shard in sae byeok’s stomach?
I am so happy kdramas are finally getting the recognition they deserve
Who the hell watched this dubbed....
I cried not even ganna lie
Green light red light
I'm gonna call it like it is it's getting wayyyy to much hype I mean it's good alot better than alot of other netflix shows but let's be real it's not THE BEST SHOW EVER like they making it out to be
Threw me off for a second when I heard the voices because I watched it in sub
Its so sad when Sebiak Died
Batatinha frita 1,2,3
That girl looks like rainbow in the krew
I hope nobody got hurt
I love your video at large but i will advice everybody who is into cryptos to Stick with ETH and BTC as much as you can guys. If everyone sells when it starts to fall, which at one point it will, the dream may be lost because of it being too volatile for companies to get behind.
Lol imagine watching this in English dub
Oh darn, they live.
Dubbing is a crime.
.
omg
Did yall watch in korean or eng? I watched in korean it just ruins the show if it's in eng
They squid Game they don't again boys
english dubs, damn, sounds so bad, why would u watch a movie with dubs? fk
Squid game sucks
1:20
really overhyped !!
I'm hoping with all the attention this series is getting and massive videos on u tube, it will influences a second season.
0:8 this part, they never thought about those cranes for stairs or ladders to play tug of war
as an interior designer, the sets are an absolute work of art. putting sets into real work and places can be very very hard and the entire time of my first time watching squid game i was mostly distracted by the set. kudos for the creative team and designer and honestly everyone for doing such an amazing job for the best series ive watched to time
The english voiceover is ridiculous hahahahhaha
Ewwww she listening to in in English 🤢
Good job good team and.good serie very hard work but worth it
the gore on this jesus
I loved squid game i fineshed it im so sad❣😔❤
Why would ypu blurr the pistol but not the MP5??
Don't be an uncultured swine, watch in original audio with subtitles
I figured that part out myself...
Did  the actors died ?
Watched first episode today and 🔥🔥No words to say + The grandpa was funny 😁 Savage 😌🔥
Love from NEPAL🙏❣️🇳🇵
Bhhhhhhhhhhhhh hhbbb
Honestly knowing how they made these scenes makes the violence less heavy and gory which makes me more comfortable with the series itself
Do they altrlue die?
Will there be another season?
Did you know it took 10 years to make the set of squid game 🦑
Deccal ⚠️
GENIUS! 💯💯💯
Carolina buenas noches le
What's a bendy guard and the boss
I really love and appreciate that this show has received so much love and attention without even having to speak english!

Imagine if YG did the serie *NO GREEN SCREEN 100*
This is as good as Parasite! Well done Squid Game.
It sounds weird with Eng dub or any other language  No hate though
Auh
6 round!!
Bruh
building the sets from scratch really REALLY added to the whole feeling of the realness of the show, kudos!
4:47 it is called Karma hahaha
Did anyone actually watch the English dub?
Imagine watching squid game in English
To the director ,cast and writer of the movie ..u guys are really amazing it a very huge project❤️❤️👏🏽
The series is dubbed in English? LMAO I never knew. I love how Korean sounds tho so I wouldn't have changed it.
The best way to watch this movie is to watch with original language
I want another season but then again I don't because I don't think it can top this one lol
Green LIGHT red light ❤️✨
No
คนไทยชอบซีรีย์นี้มากเลยค่ะ  คนทำฉากสุกยอดมากเลย
All poli 🔥
Why do they use the dub....so annoying. It's a Kdrama, represent them!
3:34 thethings be like blur the gun the things also be like dont blur the other guns
1:08 why does everyone like her
I feel bad for the viejito
Stop using dub clips
Squid games was so good because it reminds of of a Korean purge, fucked up and keeps you guessing.
I dont know how people can watch Korean films with the English dubs, I have to read subtitles because I dont like the words not matching with their lip/mouth movements.
So far the best series in a long time. Amazingly well done..
7:40 that’s what  she said ..
They have really worked hard... It's just takes seconds infront of our eyes... But ... The hard work behind tht is just... Godd!! Levelll 🔥🔥
It s so cool
The first game wasnt cgi... so they all did die
Villager farm in Minecraft be like:
lol dubbed voices
#SOUTH KOREA ❤❤❤
I was thinking what could be done in Series  2.      1) Skip rope with razor sharp ropes.           2) Simon says:  but darker.           3) dodge Ball but when tagged, you die!           4) hid and go seek.. shot when found!           5) musical chairs in “teams”. Looser get head cut off (samurai swords)            6) obstacle course with lasers on sharks in a pool (or evil sea bass).
Marbles and tug of war
The Asian community understands the assignment when it comes to these kinds of shows!!! Squid Game is just one of many you guys!!!
Lots of people called this show normal but idc this show was so goooood
corona people
Subtitles gang wya
The actors in this film.. the art. The ideas. The script. Amazing !! All of it
I appreciate the review video, but seriously watching in dubbed version is the worst. You would never feel the same emotions. I can't even stand watching Anime dubbed, let alone these sorts of movies. FML 🤦
Tiger King Coin($tking) can very easily be worth 100x it’s current price after Tiger King season 2 comes out on November 17  It’s Joe Exotic’s official crypto and the current market cap is around 20 million but growing. Get in now before it grows more.  Year of the tiger.  #虎年
Dislike for english dub
See, Hollywood! Shows without all that woke BS and political politics does well. Please take note of this.
I loooooooooooooooooooooove SQUID GAME
LMAO THE DUB
One of the best series
The dub is...
😳😳😳😳😳
They should obviously get AWARD. They really worked hard.
Ameiiiii   Traduzir para o português
Squid game has paved a way for other directors and producers to create various types of battle Royale style tv series and I couldn’t be more gassed about it!
The dabbing omg….. watch it pls in original
정말 재밌는 드라마입니다. 저는 한국사람으로서 이 드라마가 자랑스럽습니다.
With such popularity, will the writer consider to make a Season 2? ⁹¹⁰²¹
I hope ppl didn't actually watch squid game in dub
The BEST series I’ve seen since Breaking Bad! ✌🏻& ❤️
If anyone watched this with English dubs on you missed so much amazing acting.
4:51 One of the doll's hands is said to be kept by the production team.
Gotta watch it with the original voices .. dubbing takes away the gritt and emotions of the story
This yrs Halloween theme b Squid 🐙 🎮 Game
Hope Squid Game season 2 won't be a letdown
I JUST HEARD MY COUNTRY PLAYS A ROLL IN SQUID GAME I MAEN LIKE THE ARTIST ASHER
Overated
Lol
Many people said that, the glass tile game (the game you will fall) was supposed to be at 10 feet higher, but in bts its short😂😂😂
Youtube.com/nurmir
Why the f would you watch this dubbed
who the f watches this in english? please watch it in korean with subtitles haha
Best serie ever gettings from Mexico
I absolutely loved it really was amazing 👏
Ñññññññññññ
أحلي شيء  تشاهده و هو باللغلة اليابانية و مترجم من غير دبلجة مثل الدول المعقدة من مشبوحين العين
so, I’m on the last episode of squid game, lets just say episode 6 killed me, and this one will as well. I’ve always loved learning about how shows, movies etc were made. And learning about this culture. I listen to the audio in English, but sometimes turn the subtitles to the original language.
if they ever make a season 2 i think the players will realize that the games were on the wall the whole time
bro how can you watch it dubbed? it's so satisfying hearing their actual voice just better experience watching it in korean
I hate dubbing..
*One advice : watch the original audio with subs : the budded version takes away a lot of the feeling*
Gods good
Awesome 🤩
ngl this was a waste of 8 mins you're just pointing out the blatantly obvious
Red screen! Greeeeen screen!
so they could actually die if the glass broke in the glass breaking game?
5:05 really intense reaction? all he said was that he played it before
Don't fucking tell me you watched the dubbed version 🤦‍♂️
LAW OF ATTRACTION: AKO AY MAKIKILALA DIN BILANG VLOGGER AT MARAMI RIN AKO NA MAPAPASAYA AT MA-INSPIRE NA MGA TAO. GOD BLESS PO SAYO SA NAG-BABASA NITO MAGIGING SUCCESSFUL KA💛💙❤️

오징어게임 말로만 대박났다고 듣다가 이렇게 the things에 올라오고 좋아요가 9만인거 보니 실감나네.
Not sure if anyone noticed, but the part where everyone is supposed to pair up, the "staff" expected the old man (the game master) to be the odd one out, so they ordered the pink guys to "not kill the one without pair"
watching dubbed LMAO
I just can't watch the English dubbed version   Just watch the original with English subs   You just don't connect with the actors when it's dubbed in en English
At first I thought it was like real-
Ali's loss struck me most
I’m duch
Imagine if the hobbit tried to build a non-cgi world!
it makes me uncomfortable hearing squid game in dub
Parasite, The Medium, Kingdoms, now Squid Games!
Hey
How did they make the doll
relativity reminds me of harry potter too
Question:is game 5 a child’s game?
Wow wtf there's an English version? They sound so dull and boring, where is the emotion and the ACTING? They really flopped on them voice actors huh .. so glad I watched in Korean dam every single actor was putting 110% effort in
when they say dutch artist: OMG DUTCH OGMJ IM DUTHC JAGASHGFDHFREYUHGVRHTYGTHRGBV
I gotta watch this movie again! Loved it!!!!
It's great that Asian film-making is getting the recognition it deserves. Their stories tend to be very original, and we usually get different remakes and stuff.
is that... a dub? what?-
Honestly  that movie  got delayed  10 years ago So  That's why it's no popular
Honey comeb
Wow Real
oooo cool i can see it!🤩🤩
Lol someone should have that doll in their front yard for Halloween
Is this show really that disturbing because I wanna watch but I don’t know if I should
If you haven't watched this yet, PLEASE watch it with original korean audio and subtitles! I've only heard the dub on this video, but the original actors audio is wayyyyy better, do yourself the favor.
The Marble Game made my eyes tears. there are many explanations in that event. 1)player 001 & 456 (will you use your friends weakness in order to win) 2) player 69 and his wife( the challenge of marriage love) 3) your kindness can be used by your friend in order to betray you 4) that two ladies( some strangers can save you even if it cost their lives, maybe in their mind they want to save you because they failed to saved their loved ones or they died saving you because they know that their life has no meaning)
what about the fking scene :O
pleas watch it with korean dub, it fits so much better with the vibes of the serie and all
All it needs a 100000mlikes
2:50 Nederlandertje wel hopa
Yeah don't watch the show in English. It's better in the original sounds
Mugunghwa ggochi pieot suemnida
eww who watched this in english dubs
This show is a freaking masterpiece In disguise. Yeah it may be a little inappropriate BUT thats besides the point. It’s about the extreme details, like I’m episode four, once the lights started flickering everyone started going for each other,and the details of the games. So magnificent!
Whoever watched this dubbed is missing out on a lot
After watching this in sub I have decided dub is terrible
This movie deserved it, after more than 10 years of work.
ok
Tug of war was my best, esp the way the old man explained it.
Gran serie, a pesar de lo cruel de los castigos por perder tiene una gran enseñanza. La vida misma así es y los seres humanos nos olvidamos de la humanidad cuando buscamos ganar dinero. Es entonces cuando hacemos lo que sea a costa de ello.
"The director killed 400+ actors to keep it realistic"
Its cool how South Korea is being number 1 in music and film industry, they're always into quality of the product so even those people like me who can't understand Hanggul (before) can be hooked by it. They're the master when it comes to building unique ideas.
I sow squid game and I’m 8 years old
I don’t like it
me after watching behind the scenes: okay but can you give me back my nervousness now
문금화 고치 페이섬니다 🪆💵
This movie is just like movie " daruma "
if u watch this on eng dub u should be ashamed of urself
Jador
Green light red light best waithing  sezone 2 ha
Excellent movie 👍🏻❤
the dub is better than the sub
The fact that they build most of it instead of using green screen

there's dub for this drama?💀
Thank you so much
The Italian government and the Vietnamese government have accused Netflix of tax evasion! So we will never let Netflix, a large tax evasion company, enter our country !
5.6M subs with 2$ mic. you gotta be kidding me man.
I am dutch😎
The worst thing you can do is watching the show with eng dub.
I won in the honey comb one
Inagen I was in it and my mom tho I was triangle and mum!😯😵
https://youtu.be/VflA3IkyNbo 🔥
NOT THE ENGLISH DUB
Yet I still saw a green screen that was still green

The red light and green light first then honeycomb and then tug war or marble or marble or tug war and then the glass stepping game
We Waiting for 2 seson!!!!
It'll win a lot of awards
I cried so fuking bad when Ali, the old man and the girl who sacrificed herself in the marvel game died i realllly cried like shit 😭
Its amazing series.. n specially when gong yoo comes.. that was perfect delight
Did the imposter actualy see the vips d--k??
I’ve never seen this movie.
I’m glad the time they spent came to a worth
This show kind of reminds me of girl from nowhere idk why
i ate the dolls hand
Great show, no American PC BS
This whole show!!!! WOOOOW I HAVE NO WORDS BRAVO!!!! Bravo!!!
Buset gg
Disliked because you used the English dub
Who ever casted all of these actors should seriously win an award. The casting is perfect. Brilliant series!!!
When takeshi's castle turn to dark👀✨️
I remember the "BTS don't bash them love ARMY' LMFAO
Marbles 😢
Rocking movie
OSCAR DESERVED?
You should watch it in korean audio instead of english. After all, it's squid game, not quid game.
1:23 Gi-hun is wearing number 001 as a player o-o
This is by far the best series I've seen ever. And coming from a kdrama addict who has been watching kdrama since I was in college. I've always been a fan of their works because they are unique, they don't copy from previous famous series or movies. Koreans have always been a trendsetter in the whole entertainment industry. I just wish many people would watch a lot of their series and movies because it has a lot of lessons, captivating views, great actors and the story is superb like you've never seen anywhere. Because they perfect their works and always strive to be the best. They deserve a great recognition of their works. They don't need nudity, sex scene, just pure great story and execution. Very far from hollywood where flesh and sex is their market. I'm sorry to those fan of those series that I won't mention here but you don't need to get naked or sell yourself to convey a story.
I think the squid game is very excited
The 4 episode scared the shit out of me when the lights went out :(
Maybe this series come in other seasons aur get copied in other languages mainly Hollywood ... Just saying
Imagine if ZHC custome the place
So I’m guessing no S2 they showing us everything BHS
that dub at the beginning actually hurt to watch
Plz if you watched the english dub how did you not loose your mind
WHY IS THIS IN DUB LMFAO
I keep seeing comments about if your lazy or not if you watched the dubbed version...not really, I prefer it with subs because you get a sense of the language and then culture of korea by how they express something etc that being said I totally appreciate if you have learning difficulties or just find it easier to watch it in dub....another thing even if you watch with subtitles most of the time there not correct or translated into a simpler version of whats being portrayed. While im not fluent in korean several times the subtitles were not correct and took away from the message the writer is trying to convey... I have always had this problem with languages im learning or understand so dont hate on someone because the dub isn't original because the subtitles aren't 100% translated either! Enjoy it however you like its an amazing show regardless xxx
If you watched squid game with English dub…you watched a different show…that wasn’t squid game…that was octopus activity.
Squid game is what pubg would've been if it had it's own live action film 🤣
episide six got me man
o kowa ko shi piya sumi da
Great
Everyone keeps talking about the artistic picture but for me it was the acting. The acting is just outstanding. I connected with every character and every situation.
Mugunghwa Kkoci Pieot Seumnida~ 🟢🔴🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻
2:50 i’m dutch :), that’s pretty cool
Hicdofioxowxhtsbr
I loved the show! It was truly amazing! I couldnt stop watching it was so addictive!!! 😱🤦🤷🤣

SQUİD GAME - BEST LEVELS 🚦🔥🎉 - https://youtu.be/quil9NKIeRA
the walls in the room were the answer’s to the game
This show is soo overated
Who tf watches on dub
My fave was the tug of war. I was literally swaying back and forth with the actors! 😂
What kinda of series is this 😅
My brother watched all the videos when he heard about it😅
Why dubbed😑
wtf was that the actual dub at the beginning? i thought it was the narrator speaking or something wow it sounds horrible
WOW!
Green light red light was epic....The brigde was idiot... Other games nah .....
I like , gi-hun , Ali Abdul , sae-byeokI just want to say is Ali from Pakistan
i just want to see a battle between the doll and the daruma from as the gods will
Tbh I never consider watching a show if I need to read captions but this show was the first one that was worth it, from the storyline, to the set.. brilliant !
Green light red light is an easy game
Plot twist the gun was the toy gun  We use to play with Airsoft
not the dub😂
ew the dub of the show....lol.

Цзц жшду жшннукфжн
one of the best series of all time
l think l saw it because l can australian a few days be for covid
Yea I seen it a little bit
Yikes @ the dub
Sub > dub
Those stairs remind the Harry Potter stairs
All the comments about subtitles or not are stupid. I think the English acting wasn’t great so it makes sense that you would watch it with the subtitles. I also only have a very small screen to watch it and can’t sit still long enough to stare at the same thing for hours at a time, I have stuff to do, so I use the dub. The idea that using sub is automatically better than dub or vice versa stupid, they’re both translations of the same language into the same language, one’s just written in the other spoken. Are use subtitles for everything because I have audio processing issues sometimes, but that doesn’t mean I want to have to stare at the screen every second they’re just there to help me out. Like seriously, it doesn’t make you lazy. Especially because I watch TV for entertainment! Even if it was lazy that would be fine because I’m trying to relax no one‘s paying me to do this. Like some people just want to feel superior, watch it however you want! It’s media! It’s not supposed to be a competition or unpleasant, so consume it the most enjoyable way for you, whether that means investi nb hours of analysis and note taking and subtitles, or vaguely paying attention while scrolling through social media.
Who took the hand off?
No offense to the voice actors but the dubbed version is trash. Okay sorry my point is actually offensive lol. Read subtitles people!
I was right that the walls are the game's that is coming next.Red light green light,Honey comb And Marbles, Tag of war,i dont know this game but i think it is glass step. the last one is the original Squid game
Is it just me or does that man with short to longish hair looks a little like psy .
I love the 4 game most "tug and war"
Dub? Euhhh💆🏻‍♂️
the dub-
For the CGI part-  Harry Potter be like: 👁👄👁
The splendid money advisably correct because wrinkle consquentially dust till a joyous close. parched, quack beer
Their hardworks really paid off and they deserve all the attention 👍🏻👍🏻
Kim Jung of Korea is also watching ,May be he will experiment this game with his people who oppose him .
Not interesting movie at all
“… and going up the sideways stairs.”
Squid game deserves an award. It’s one of the best shows yet. There was LOTS of emotion. And just because I’m saying that doesn’t mean just bc it has Saebyeok in it doesn’t mean it should, it’s because they tried very hard.
The doll could take every player out but one :) **wink wink**
That is so freaking
Ugh, the English voice acting was atrocious. I started watching with subs until the horse betting scene since it was so well acted and swapped to English to see how bad it may be. All impact was gone ... Watch with subs, you won't regret it. There is some forced English voice acting later in the show and it is really corny and annoying.
BTSOSG
Ew is that what it sounds like in english?😭
The intelligent haircut radiographically suppose because fear potentially bore failing a delicate meal. jealous, swift waitress
A relief to see how it was filmed, at least no one dies
I cannot stand when people watch foreign movies or shows dubbed in English! It takes away from the experience.
As soon as I seen this hit net flix Im pretty sure I was one of the first people that watched it and got hooked fast as fuck Chinese people just make everything so much better then everyone else in this world lol
This is art, a whole masterpiece. The best show I’ve ever watched.
◯△□
No words
Squid game is my show of the year
Korean audio >
Why did you use dub videos?! The movie is soooo much better with the original actors voices! I can’t stand dubbed. Lol.
I love the show and all but wht if the min character chose the red card at first
For a Hugely well produced series with such great sets for every scene there are emotions and feelings which contribute to the acting and voice of the actors that simply cannot be replicated by dubbed versions of it
Such an incredible well thought out show as well as sets. Big win for Asian movies. I’m so happy and I hope they win something big.
오징어 게임
unless you're fucking blind, do not watch english voiceover.
RED LIGHT STOP GREEN LIGHT GOOOOO
Omg how did they- the props and backdrops must've been really hard and pricey to build. Congrats to everyone envolved in the movie.
IT LOOKS REAL-
THE HINTS WERE BEHIND THE BEDS 😦

Terrifying movie and looks real they all great actors

That series had me laughing my head off because it's INSANE especially the marble game and the glass scenes marble game old ma  is about to "die" supposedly so he stands their with a sob story while his partner has his back towards him and the old creepy man says hey then gives him advice them POW I mean seriously for what??? 😂🤣😂 all because he lost? man bye lol the  the glass scene had me laughing in tears bcais ether dude that praying had the most highest confidence in the entire universe for a split sec did you see how God answered his prayers when the other dude fell right them he knew he was blessed he has smirk on his face boyyyy like hell yea then the way he jumped like a ninja to the other glass and stood down for a split sec in a pose as if to make sure the glass doesn't collapse under him 😂😂😂 but things like do do happen unfortunately amongst high ranking people peace
She watched this in English?
Pov: 'you broke your honeycomb'  Me: *Hello let me see your honeycomb* >:(

https://youtu.be/09k7Jl92r7k DJ SQUID GAME, TRAP FULLBASS
She was brave to smile 7:29
Oh god the English dubbing is damn bad.
KOREA has a really really good movies and series since ALWAYS…good that Netflix is taking their extraordinary good work to the rest of the world!
Anyone else notice how all the games are on the all’s in the big room but nobody in the game ever noticed this
L.O.V.E  Squid 🦑  Game  👍 💖❤️💕🦑🦑🦑🦑
English version makes me cringe so hard.
Actually in an interview the art director mentions the bunk beds were modeled on supermarket shelves, to imply the contestants are expendable merchandise.
I am almost 8 but I wish I have a school like this
How about the headaches that I got by watching this series.
Great story telling in Korean cinema
⏺🔼⏹
Sub > Dub
Wait this wasn’t a documentary??
Woooooo
do they get paid😂
You should’ve included the tempered glass game because the behind the scenes is really cool
Wow! It's a nice surprise to see people all around world enjoying this drama as much as we Koreans do!
Sorry I cringed at the dubbing in the beginning
Who ever watch this in dub you suck
The show deserves all the hype and fame it's getting 👏 the production was amazing
This sets capture the backroom/ liminal spaces vibe pretty good
Impostar + villager =
God the English dub is sooo baaaad
Red light……………green light……………red light
um there koereon
The 2nd most popular watch on global ?? Squid game BTS
Damn, I wanna go to Korea and see the doll now.
I can’t even Imagine how many squid game Halloween costumes there are gunna be lol
they were made of the same materials as tunnels.... this girl is stupid
Never underestimate the underdog! Only to think, so many producers turned down the script in prior years .Ouch!  Reminds me of Kid Rock with Eminem.peace ,love and community #thezombieassassin
I want to play also without the killing and injuring
My favorite game was red light really made me glued to the couch
These guys were warriors. This was WAR. They worked their ass off
That doll will haunt me in my dreams 😥
Squid game depicts our society. Doing evil for wealth
anime watchers when people complain about not wanting to read the subtitles and watch it in english: *pathetic*
ur voice is fucking annoying
I can't wait for the second season let the games begin
I thought that this was the behide the scenes how rude😭 😠🗯😡😾💢
The last game
WHY DOES SHE SAY SQUID GAME LIKE SCKWID GAME
Yo
This show is really impressive. I just loved it.
영어 더빙 진짜 형편 없네 걍 한국어 더빙에 다가 영어 자막 보는게 더 좋겠네
I’m proud of my country, South Korea  in many ways. 🇰🇷
Why is it so bad when its DUB😥
the squid game probably has the most actors
Best kdrama!
your voice is the most calming thing ive ever heard
Squid game really paved the way now more and more people are watching Korean movies and Drama.
wow, now this was interesting. i really enjoyed watching this!
Fun fact! The doll for the red light green light was inspired by the little girl from totoro
One of the best shows on Netflix. Cannot wait for season 2. There has to be a a season 2. Terrific series.
istg if they don’t give  Squid Game an award for the best and most watched Netflix series i’m gonna throw some hands
W
I played red light green light and the marble game in Korea when I was a kid. No one died... I feel cheated lol
It’s creepy when you created the doll
this is amazing! never would have thought about something this insane
I watched it it was awesome even though I’m 8 years old
Thumbs up if you watched this series in Korean with English subtitles and not that poorly dubbed over English version. Korean soaps deserve to be watched in their purest form. Korean!  That said this was an awesome series!
wow.
Honeycomb is my favorite game but if you break it you die but its really cool!
We want season 2 😀
if u watched squid game in English ur crazy
I don’t know but the secret of this series is spoiling too much of it by social media for views. 🤗😷 too much knowledge is blaah it should be mysterious and for other great movies and series out there..
So addicting! Love it!
“They’re just kids games, right? They can’t be that hard.”
Every one mad Korea is starting to do too !much now come on
⚠️ SPOILER ALERT 🚨  The grandpas house in the marble scene, his address was the same as symbols on the cards 🔺◾️🔘 What if that was the huge hint foreshadowing that it was actually his games since the whole set up of the marble scene was specifically made for him...?
I got a new single called GOT ME STARTED ON YOUTUBE NOW. You can Presave my single on all platforms on 10/13. Please check me out and Tell me what Y’all think💯
eww y'all watched this dubbed?
*the only thing preventing me from watching squid game is the blood-* i'm only used to like-  drawn blood or somthing ;-;
Did anybody hear the afrobeats playing in the background in 1:11 and 5:07
I musty give the crew major props to doing all the sets
People just found out about K Drama huh? They are always all out guysss their K Drama are movie standart!
Why watch the dubbed version??? Korean language is so expressive and it adds to the feel of watching
Where am I?
She repeated the same thing like 6 times
Love from India . Asian rocks ....Always unique idea comes from South korea
hmmmmmsts Deok Su woowow wahh hmm our favourite chracacter
I can’t wait for the season 2
To be honest i thought the mouth of the doll will open and shoot (i read too many manga on death games i guess) now i know why it didnt shoot as its an actual doll.
This show is just waste of time actually.. And the end is even worse
Did anyone realize that the markings on the wall where the order of each games
In many countries, building real sets and hiring extra actors is actually easier and cheaper than CGI.
Squid Game Is fuckin serial
Ok guys guys did u know they have been working on squid game for       10 YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN THEY WERE WORKING ON IT
;}
English dub cringe of highest level
Some people in the Philippines posting I'm not gonna watch this cause I'm not trend watcher like WTF of course it's new it's trend you literally going to watch it I think they are going to wait until it takes year then they are going to watch it cause it's not trend anymore what a idiot.
This movie Nothin  John Wick insane. Why people suck squid game
Damn, I can't believe they actually killed actors for that authenticity
Squid Game show experience is good: Korean audio Squid Game show experience is bad: English audio Listen in Korean or you're lame
In This There’s Only One Indian Guy
Way to be Asian rn
This is the first legit Korean show I see and it’s absolutely ecstatic!
i was busy thinking about where did they got the vpice from the doll
Green Light, red Light was quite an opener of the game. I like it alot.
I like the Indian looking guy the most
Should I watch squid game ?
Who watch squid game in dub? That's a crime
5:45 “not a single corner was cut”  but for the English dubbed version they cut every single fucking indent they found
koreans be killing it recently within the film industry with parasite and now squid game :D
Am sure am not the only person that finished the whole movie in a day
Netflix should build theme parks with their IPs. People will throw money at the door. Squid game, stranger things, etc
POPULAR OPINION: SQUID GAME IS NOT OVERHYPED, IT'S INDEED SUPERB.
Red light green light
COME ON READ THIS COMMENT FAST       Red LIGHT! Green Light      RED LIGHT! *You Died*
This series remind me to Danganronpa
Come on season 2 already😭
Are you trying to tell me that these people didn't really die? Why did I watch it then?!
Tell me you don't have enough words for your essay without telling me you don't have enough words for your essay...
i wasted all my tears on old man.
This is not a BTS video. A BTS vidéo involves actual footage behind the scenes of them making the show. This sucks
noic
Ew why did you watch the dubbed version
I didn't know it was dubbed until this video
for the love of god don't EVER have the english version on instead of the original,it feels way better having the korean with subtitles on than this
When I saw the staircase I thought Labyrinth.
Moment of silence for everyone who watched the english dub over
Damn watch the subbed version ppl the dubbed is so funny lol
I know you did NOT just use the English dub.
me who got scared by every squid game scene: ***im underaged***
In the thumbnail number 9’s feet look like hands
I watched in one evening night lol
they did a good job the movie btw
The blood is fake or real.....?
The glass scene was the most intense for me!
Why are all those videos with English dubbing? Are Americans the only people who actually watch DUB? I mean, do as you wish but damn.
무궁화 꽃이 피었습니다
Practical effects > CGI
“The actor who plays number one” JUST SAY OH IL-NAM THEY HAVE NAMES OMG. This is the most racist whitewashed video covering squid game Eve you didn’t even use the Sub version for the clips
Why did you do the English dub for the clips that’s so annoying 😭
EWWWWW WHAT ENGLISH DUB
First time hearing their English voices and wtf did I just hear lmao. It's like some sort of ASMR person talking in one tone what
So we’re we all crushing on Sae-Byeok? No? Just me ? Okay😩
No wonder this was made in 2019 and release in 2021...
Giant doll isnt creepy, ITS SOO CUTE!!!
Tt
I could of lived my whole life without hearing that show in English dubbed.
It’s so weird to hear the dubbed version lol
Great
I wanted to watch this video but the dub said NO
OMG! OK
First Parasite and then Squid Game.. Korean movie industry is very underrated.. Best movie industry in Asia
Ngl, the dubbed version ruins the entire show, please everyone, watch it in Korean with English subtitles, it has a better effect cause the dub just clowns the show
Here’s the thing even if they knew all the games before they were going to die either way like the staff would have made them fight each other to death because that’s the thing. Also why would you watch a kdrama in English 🤢
I heard that the doll is like a learning piece like if Kathy has three Apple and Ben has for how many apples do they have to gather so the doll is like Kathy
Watching squid game in dub is cringe af
Only watch this with subtitles. The voiceovers are terrible.
The moment I saw those stairs I even told my partner like this is that the image of relativity that we learn to draw in elementary school
the things watches it dubbed 😭🖐🏽
man,i love this series,masterpiece! was hoping next season,bravo to all actor
it sounds stupid in english it was better if they just set subtitles
Wait 1 question did the people in squid game actually die?
It's good but wouldn't say it's as hyped as everyone makes it out to be imo saw is better but again it is new and entertaining but not a 10 out of 10
this is just impressing
Not even watched it but I hope they turn on those pink suit people and slaughter them 🙃
Dubs be like:cough cough noo he died whyy
Plot twist : this is real game footage, captured by that police officer !
This set design is a breath of fresh air after seeing so many "marvel infinity war green screen wall of doom" kinda stuff (no hate to those movies at all) I'm just really happy to see such stunning sets.
Hogwarts
This is awesome
It is real
...you watched it dubbed? I trust nothing you say.
코로나 아니였으면 관광상품으로 개발하면 그 수익이 어마어마 할텐데...
Great art direction
Giving a thumbs down because the clips in the video were dubbed. honestly what the fuck just add subtitles
Wowww
If you watched this dubbed, you’re an idiot. This honestly blew any other show, movie, anything out of the water. A GREAT STORY.
The games are great which makes the movie exciting but the twist of the story is predictable. It is a great movie but overrated.
Not even Korean but I'm so proud of them. Koreans are so musically and artistically inclined. Just look at the quality of their series, movies and music!
“001 had a really intense nostalgic reaction”   001: “i played marbles once and it reminded me of the past”
Wow you watched it in English🤦🏻‍♂️
Hoooooooooooo Hi mommy
Am I the only one who watched it korean and with English subtitles. It is so weird listening to them with another  voice . It is much better in the original version
OMG
Why is this in english and not actual korean? The english sounds terrible on these ppl😂
:v
Last night didn't sleep cause of squid game.....Just started and finished
They can make Squid Game theme park also.
I was expecting to be underwhelmed, given all the hype...but I was very impressed by this show. The only weak spot was the annoying American actors. The Korean actors were all amazing.
Nice job, Director Hwang Dong-Hyuk! 13 years paid off * 0 *
I'm sorry, but the English dub is just terrible.
Imagine seeing one of the dead actors from squid game but then your like “aren’t you supposed to be dead?!” 😂
It caught me off guard since this is the first time I've heard their voice in dub🤣🤣
I can’t be the only one who can’t stand the English dub
40:20
Mugunghwa kkoci pieot seumnida         I also speak English, I memorized
You know it was someone’s first time watching Korean dramas or that someone just started watching Korean dramas, when they have it in English 💀
The whole show reminds me of PlayStation
I'm sorry but the English version is to awkward to watch...
The set/look of the film is what first attracted me to the show. I swore the hallway set wasn’t real, it so interesting looking.
who the fuck watched the dubbed versio
I finished the movie squid game now
They deserve to win awards this is huge success to the director who rejected many times and now look at his story, it's trending all over 90+countries 😌😌😌😍😍😍😍😍
Indonesia viral this film
I hope if they fall of those glass stepping thingys I just hope if they fall there is a trampoline down there I hope
Wait so you censor the pistol at 3:44 but the smgs arnt censored?
The eng dubbed version sounds cringe af ...
no dub！！！！
Man that's awesome :0
You know movies that don’t use to much CGI settings such as mad max become such an amazing view to watch! Yes it might take more time and work but at the end it’s all worth it! Movie companies should take notes!
I like how everyone is so interested in squid games😅
WE NEED MORE OF BEHIND THE SCENES!
But the thing is those wall paintings were never noticed by the finalists... 😂😂
Yeah dont watch this in dub. Do yourself a favor
There will season 2 for sureeee!!!!
My biggest flex is that i watched squid game on the day it was released. I watched it with my parents, we started watching at 8 am & finished watching it at like 6pm
Bruh Jeff Bezos must've paid for the making of this series
Yepp kudos to the efforts itself so little cgi is used for the world building.
Look at the camera man he also joined the green light and red light. ... Lol😂😂
So much people will thunders…
Ewwwww... Yal watched it in English dub???
It would probably like take 10 hours
I'm so glad squid game is getting the recognition it deserves! finally my family and friends can see why I enjoy watching kdramas, the acting and overall effort put into this show this is astonishing. ps. if you haven't watched it yet and are thinking to, I recommend using the original audio with subs :)
Dubbings make everything weird 😅
There’s just SOMETHING about that Greenlight Redlight set that does it for me. Creepy but weirdly mesmerising. And the way the scene played out as well, and the players’ reactions to what was happening, all masterfully done.
Go S.Korea!!
Definitely an ambitious investment and show but it was worth it!
English dub is shit. Every dub is shit.
They should preserve it and use it for tourism like Doctor Who’s police box
That doll is what many road law breakers need in their lives.
Squid game
o
I like the playground◼⚪🔺️
"South korea daejeon" Me who live in daejeon Ö
Was it necessary to put English voices over subtitles only??
I loved Glass Stepping Stones. Its a game of pure luck and instinct.
why would anyone watch the english dubbed version and not the original lmao, voiceovers are cringy af... A main part of acting is VOICE...
I've never heard Squid game dubbed, in my opinion it's horrible lmao
I finished Naruto in one day
Ive really did knew that squid game existed before it was shown to public, i was waiting for this series since june… becuz was searching for a movie to watch and squid game is the firt i saw! And i tought it will come out on december lol hahaha
Player 212 and 101 traitor mistrust and die predicted death
wow its nice to see they didn’t actually fall to their death:D
You know you spoiled some of it right?
I like this squaid game drama from Korean country i like this drama i am from india.....
Imagine the people who died in the first game
One of the Best series ever!
About to watch the whole thing until I heard the English dub
I knew those people didn't die
I love watching in their real voices not dubbed tho ❤
i love how the cameramen also have to play in green light red light xD
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME A KID-FRIENDLY BEHIND THE SENCES
if you didn't see the series in Korean you didn't see the series. way too much of the actor is lost
It's so weird when I hear them speak English 😂 I'm a Malaysian and I don't really change the audio to English when I'm watching dramas like Money Heist lol, it's just weird to see their movement of their mouth out of place
Green light red light
I know everything about the show but why did you be in boxes are they dying for real life because I didn’t see this video and I don’t know what to think
Epic
They could’ve made this a movie. I mean, it is 9 episodes long.  (Pls don’t harass me it’s just my opinion)
My 2nd favorite serial movies..my no.1 is walking dead.. 😁
Why numberblocks 64.625 is not coming
did they just use the english dub for this video?.... stop. just stop
doll: red light player: *moves* doll: so you have chosen death _gunshot_
What about that big cat?
Not all the scenes happened in front of green sheets. They put lots of efforts to built sets. That's why this show is biggest hit.
Ddaaaaaakji
🧙‍♂️ 7:30 👁
Bruh the camera man is playing red light green light too
The dub 😂😂😂
i watched too much kdramas, jdramas, and anime. squid game was kinda basic for me
Hearing the dubbed version is kinda weird.
무궁화 꽃이 피었습니다~ 🎶
게임을 하시겠습니까? 🟦🟥
I like how no one is wearing face mask even though coronavirus is contagious and everyone is staying close together
Clicked on this video so fast 💨
Comon It’s korea what’d you expect a low budget??
Ffck with the dub... wtf
Ok this is a game but People really die?
Red right green right they die real?
*SUBS NOT DUBS*
wtf who watches squid game with dubbing
This show needs to win top awards otherwise I'm losing faith in the international award community
i want to see the bathroom behind the scene lol (ill not spoil)
Wait....was this Dubbed in English? Lol I watched it with the subs on lol
Everything looks awesome, honestly. Props to the people who are in charge of building those structures just for the show 👏👏👏 The aesthetics in this are also unique!
Who tf watches in dub????? Took me off guard!
You people saw squid game with dubbed voices?  Jesus!  The real Korean voices with subtitle is way better
The squad game stairs are from Harry Potter xD
Amazing!!!
The English dub 🤮🤮🤮
I just wanted to let you know i disliked because you used dub instead of the original. You know what you did.
People actually watch it in English 🤢
Green light 🏃‍♂️ 💨💨💨💨 red light🙎‍♂️
Oof squid game dub? No offense ro the dub but the actors' acting would go to waste.  Just fuckin read subtitles!
Korean language is better than the boring English..
Why would you use the dub version
Honestly, as an audience of this movie, I’d say that squid game is an overhyped movie. I love their sets, the game-concept, their characters. Roughly, it is an interesting movie. But about the storyline, its not my favourite. I’d say the storyline is boring, cliche and predictable. Btw ‘storyline’ is the second thing I expect from the movie since the first thing, which is the games on each episodes, has been crushed down and failed to give me the hype. Red light green light, well that’s a good start, but then honeycomb in shapes? Tug-of-war? Marbles? Glass bridge? (Honestly, glass bridge is the most disappointing one for me, since they put it in the semi-final round with grand setting, but then the game is so simple and players are so slow with too many dialogues) I even won’t prepare these kind of games in middle school treasure hunt (if i get the chance to) since its boring (not talking about the games set, but the point is the GAMES itself, its boring) . And I don’t think the immediate death for the losers can also elevate the creepiness/psycho feelings of the movie. Its not working for me, and for my whole family too, they think exactly same as mine. I don’t think that I watched more sci-fi movies with games concept more than anybody in the world, but then I confused why squid game is so hyped. I want to understand that. For yall, why you like or hate about squid game actually?   Ps: btw I’m sure yall also can predict that the old man is actually the owner of game right?
U guys watch it in english💀💀💀🤚
Not many programs to watch with no or little cgi like squid game , that’s why it was so popular
Amazing I loved it, gave me hella anxiety
Watch it in korean!!!
I got thrown away with the dub  does anyone actually watch the dub unless you can't read  what are you, 3?
Hats off to the team of _Squid Game_  🔥 and the director. Cinematographer , Production designer, Art director and editor deserves a special mention❤️
i love that squid game becuse i love that movie on netflix
ew, shouldnt have used the english dub, you could have just used the english subtitles and done it the incredible and original Korean dub
Hope north Korea is watching n learning from this instead of building nuclear weapons
Why when they speak a;lol face has cut \
the doubling took me out.....it was necessary??
that dub at the intro was gross
I pity those who didn’t watch it in its native language aka Korean. It adds so much when consumed in its original form
I'm disgusted by the fact that you used the shameless dubs in some of the clips
Whoever chose the English dub over Korean, fuck you.
DUDE STOP WITH THE DUBS I HATE IT THEY SPEAK not the same it dosent sounds like its coming from the character.
the english dub..
The craze of Squid Game is going 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
eww!! dubbing korea movie to english??
At least the actors are rich in real life.
Esse filme (série) é um reflexo da falência financeira e desespero (e/ou desilusão) social pós pandemia....
Have season 2 or not?
Wtf. Don't watch in English dub. Just read the sub title. It's so much better.
Omg I can’t even believe how much this all cost o-o
This is my third time watching Squid game..Gosh am addicted!!Korea i must give u a round of applause..Man this is good!!!Africa,Zambia here...
⭘ △ ▢
Wow
From what i have read, the doll was made specially for the show, and it was moved to the museum after the recording, so that was a false fact right there.
💙⃢💚⃢💜⃢💛⃢❤️
Asian win..  Lol
I don't know and is squid game
Honeycomb
Bts ruined it xd
After years I finally knew what the name of te stair art name
Thats how perfect the movie was from the beginning until the End that almost everybody didnt even realize the clues on the wall.  What a Brainfukk
the first game's set is straight out of a korean grade school book. the creepy doll is actually a larger-than-life-sized version of the girl in the early level language textbooks. anyone who did korean language school with these books definitely recalls the player's uniforms and the set to an unnerving level of detail... it's some disturbing stuff for real
Man this show is amazing, when it first was released my family and I binged watched it until 3am💀💀 worth it
But r they actually dead
Fun fact  The man who created squid game has written the show in 2009 and has been rejected for 10 years straight by the companies. Now, the show is #1 in 90 countries.
English dub xddd
That English dub should be illegal
If I in this game I would ask if there any cameraman job
Why Americans do not watch foreign film in original soundtrack with English subtitle?   That’s what we foreigners do when watching American movies because it gives more compelling emotions.
it was green jackets and blue screen background. why did u switch it in the thumbnail?
I wish korean subtitles would do better job when it comes to korean insults. The way we insult one another is so articulate and so clever lol. Hard to explain but when they were talking shit the subtitles aint really a spot on translation. They gotta do better
Red light green Light
The best show I’ve ever watched
Squid game is awesome such worth binge watching ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️the actors did such a great job and just the whole set was beautiful and the colors they used really stood out to me it just something different  a breath of fresh air…..just loved this Drama so much ……I’m really hoping for a season 2🤞
Squid Game's main cast delivers incredible performances but not so much the actors playing the VIPS lol
thank you for recording your audio in on a phone shoved into tin can
THIS IS WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT! If we can have enough budget we can make the best sets for the actors. It brings out genuine reaction and that alone is an amazing addition to the scene.   As much as possible, less CGI is the best. Fantasy themed might struggle but it's something we can do in the future
This is a Masterpiece
C-c-c-c-c-c-c Can some b-b-b-b-b-b-body give me n-n-Netflix?
And I think one of the reasons why the series is so good is because the script and the story is well prepeared and well written, cause the director said that he started to write it back in 2008, right?
This series is a masterpiece.
3 days ago boys
My mom no let me watch squid game but me AHH I WANNA WATCH
I want black eyes I have blue
I cannot wait to see what Season 2 brings to the table! SquidGames season 2!
7:10
Next season, Squid game : 1980.  ( or 2015 with the detective his brother )
Fun fact: the games were on the walls if you look behind the scenes
Wait.. If thss is all behind the scene.. What happen to the dead players?
ew dub
now what the fuck is that dub
if you understand Korean, it's much deeper when you watch this series. Fortunately i studied Korean a while back so i know every they say in the movie without subtitle or voice over. One example, when Ali was calling for Sang-Woo and he kept saying "hyung", it means "big brother" from one male to another in Korea. Ali truly loved and looked up to SangWoo since day 1 and til the end to only get betrayed by SangWoo and died.
Wait this show is dubbed?
there is no way I would watch this Dubbed it has to be in Korean 🔥
4:19
Everybody a gansta, till you gotsta CUT A DANG KID CANDY IN THE SHAPE OF AN UMBRELLA TO SAVE YO LIFE!!
Im your biggest fan litterally obsessed
Wait! There's an English dub!
the actors are so good at acting i literally was traumatized before seeing this video bc i thought the deaths were real and as a person like me i have a big fear of death so thank you for telling me this
Batatinha frita 1...2..3
There's a filipino in that squidgame
Whoever watched this show with English audio…grow up
The marbles game was shot very well. That set is so small when you view it from overtop, but in the show, it looks a fair bit larger.
i hate that you chose dubbed snippets.
The Stairs looks like hogwarts stairs
Why use the dubbed one :(
Such an amazing series i dont regret watching it one bit and i dont even watch asian series or movies.
The fact that the giant doll is real😰😰
god the dub is so cringe
wow is squid game 👍👍😁
I’m getting a lot of kick out of all of squid game’s success as a Korean. I hope everyone else does too. Diversity for the win.
The English sub for me is disgusting
As an art student, the art direction IS SO GOOD. SO MUCH SYMBOLISM and SO MUCH THOUGHT. Not only is the plot well done and the depth of the characters, but the sets and wardrobe design ARE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. One of my favorite parts of the drama.
Idk why film productions in the United States use CGI so much. I love Korean films and shows, can't stop rewatching it ♥️ I love the real sized props and stages
I hate English squid game it’s a lil cringe
Not gonna lie the bridge challenge blew me away .
Yall go watch extracurricular its cool af
Honey comb
Let's be honest. If Squid Game were to really come out in 2008-2010 it would've been too early for its time, and may not have received this feedback. I'm glad it came out this year because it seems way more modern and in lined with the story.
Imagine they use the already-made back-drop into an escape room for the fans/VIPs to play 😳
You talked over the real show more than actually showing behind the set. Also, how can you honestly show clips from the show in dubbed audio. You must be illiterate if you think that is the way to watch it. Or you think your fans are illiterate?
I never look at red light green light the same
Big regret not being smart enough to think of having original audio with English subtitles
MC ESHER POG!
Sooo did they actually die or was that CGI in the red light green light?
I have a big fat crush on all of the characters/actors
..............dont watch dubbed, always go subbed. you're missing so much for the performance and message/intention if u go dubbed
I would die on on honeycomb
3:44 why was this blurred?
They shouldn’t over do by making a second season. That’s where shows fail when they over do it.  It was already amazing. I wouldn’t mess with it anymore. 🙂
good video, but buy a real microphone :(
اجمل مسلسل 👏
Did anyone notice how 456 was wearing 001 at start of video 1:23
I hope Philippines showbiz industry will reach this kind of show one day..not some generic mistress drama and slapstick comedy always feed to Filipino viewers..
Squid game I like the old man better
Do they actually die in the game squid games
The thing that scares me is when they all are hanging in to the rope, cause they are all getting kicked in the face. Yikes!
Wtf its a english dub so shit
the reason they used blue screen is that the outfit of the players are in green
why the dub for this vid
Huh yuh
ew. it sound so fucking terrible in english.   english voice actors for asian shows are always SO FUCKING TRASH. it’s like they got the worse voice actors that were rejected for everything else.   do yourself a favour, and be respectful to the original actors and have a better viewing experience :) (unless u are illiterate, but then u aren’t even reading my comment right now)
Gotta watch this series, sets seem amazing, just busy playing Claw Stars on mobile at the moment.
I usually watch foreign shows with original Audio and English subtitles
They just threw in a “That’s what she said” at the end
Thank God I didn't watch this in English.
Hearing him speak in English actually made my ears bleed
ngl the english  version is weird compaire to the original version
What an amazing show!🔥🔥
If this is what took you to be interested in Korean filmography, you should really dig deep. Despite the lack of emotion and storyline most American films have, Koreans are amazing story writers. Not saying one is better than the other, however venture out and explore yourself.
top👍😍
The blurred out guns tho😂😂😂
I didn’t even know this was released with dubs… what a waste
Every series/movie or whatever is way much better with their original voices, I never watch things with dubbing, in fact, that's a great way to learn a new language, so yeah, they should stop dubbing things, except if it's for kids...
Sugar honeycomb
why is the gun censored at 3:44 when all the other weapons are not?
Who hell no who has the audacity to watch anything dubbed? 🤮
People says Game of Thrones is best series in the world. Nop i don't think after watching this series so 😏
Such a great show, I cannot get enough of this can't wait for season 2!
I love everything about this series.
I prefer dubbed animes if i have the chance but the korean version is just so much better than the english version.
I was counting on grandpa but-
can i be in the squid game pweasee
Episode 6 😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺😢😢😢💔💔💔😞😞😞😪😪😪😔😔😔🤕🤕
😒
무궁화 꽃이 피었습니다
Veryyy amazingg
I love this series😃😍

Ive only seen first episode ;-; my mum doesn’t want me watching it so I just started yesterday, watching it with my sibling when mum isn’t home
Red Light Green Light 1 2 3(?), translated it in Japanese Version of Red Light, Green Light
Where they get the shot for the blood
I watched the Korean version of this who else?
Why do you mean by "not using CGI" when you are showing at the same exact moment a set built with blue screens? To change the appearence of the background is also CGI, not just adding people...
Why y’all watching this dubbed 🤢
sub over dub
Bro was that dub it makes me cringe cause I watched sub
Mhhkkk Lk
I'm watching this 2nd times. I don't know why but after  I've known the result, it gives me more fun.
It's so good
The dub is extremely weird. You gotta watch the show in the original korean with subtitles. The entire soundscape is better.
the english dub was fucking awful
The writing, the set design, the acting…oh the acting - I mean even down to the extras. Wow. You can tell every single person on this set took this shit seriously and genuinely gave their best efforts.   This show makes me wanna do reviews just so I can talk about it more. Good studf
I hope and pray this doesn’t not get recreated by …well…nevermind 🤐
Apparently the only persons I find attractive are koreans,Chinese and japan
When i watch squid game, i forgot that it was a movie
Overdub detracts from great acting.
6:14 wait so they acually died...
Anything uncanny; *Let’s use that*
As someone who watches K-dramas, I naturally used subtitles and oh my God, the dubbing is worse Very less emotions
i triend english dub for 2 sec and changed it imidently back
Squid ward + game=squid game
Squid game is overrated
THE DUBBB
Yea nice serie ever but,  where can i meet the guy at the metrostation ? 😂
the English dub is so bad holy shit
The only thing that was unrealistic was the fact that these billionaires would spend that much money on sets, clothes, props, soldiers, food etc on a game and then a prize on top of it....
I watched season 1 all the episodes in one day only. Amazing👌🏽👏🏽👍🏽
I watched it twice..for some odd reason, I still really don't understand the last game..squid game 😅
i thought they used a lot of cgi considering how real it looked.
0:00 me asking a Question in class and I'm the only one   Everyone: 0:02
If you watched this with dubbed voices, congratulations, you are a retard.
I'm going to a Halloween party on the 31st. I'm wondering if or how many will show up in Red.
4:05     NANI?!    WHAT-   I have so many questions
“The actor had a really intense nostalgic reaction”  The actor : I played marbles once
Doll is creepy game is scary And IT has blood
All I have is a WOW. It's about time Asian people cat the actual recognition on an international level. And the writing in South Korea has always been really good.
lol who watched this in english dubbing, that's no fun at all
People who dont realise its scary when you watch it Lol
여기에 있는 모든 게임은 빨간색 빛 녹색 빛, 벌집, 줄다리기, 구슬 및 오징어 게임입니다.
“The actor-“ WHATS HIS NAME
don’t be lazy watch w subtitles;)
I love the show. And would love to see some behind the scenes. The annoying American accent commentating in a Watch Mojo style video is why I gave it a thumbs down, not because of the show. The show is brilliant.
Dubbed 🤮🤮🤮🤮
I just started watching SQUID GAME yesterday and it’s so addicting lol 😂
Am i the only person who liked the English voice?
Do they actually die?
This is truly a masterpiece 😌🌸💕
anyone who watched the dubbed version of this: slap yourself
Aucks that the actors know the outcome of the show and they womt be able to experience watching the show as much as us viewers did. But participating makes up for it i guess
I haven't  watched the film I'm gonna watch at one point
Why sensor the hand gun when they are clearly holding SMGs in a later part of the video?
My brother said squid game advertises play station since play station is was made by a Asian person the circle square and triangle guard are wearing it I think?
dying is fun.
I am John cena
the doll has a squid game sympol clip on it's head
The fourth episode called "Stick to the team" where everyone just kills eachother in flashing lights was the most disturbing shit I have seen.
stupid movie!!! no one can take lives but god!
한국인 없음?!!
lol woah... hearing the english dub is incredibly weird
Dubbed or not this show was amazing
Ooooo
굿
I love it but I wanna watch it but I’m to young:(
Squid is becoming famous over Asia everyone is watching 😮
I forgot the main character name but fuck him. He mad annoying 😂(in the show atleast)
No way, that hallway was inspired by mc esher what, never would have guessed
Talk about masterpiece   This is Hugeee!
People didn't die ?... in real ?..
Korean always make Asia proud 😊😊😊😊
This show is so cool I love it
This is so cool 🤩
3:17 I was waiting to hear it was inspired by Ariana grandes music video like the stairs within everything 😩😍😂
아주 멋져요, 그들은 다른 역할을 했습니다, 제발
Season 2 squid game getting filmed rn leaks here https://youtu.be/-FdCcjXO5yQ
:John 14:6 “I am the way to the truth and the life. The only way to the father is through me”✝️- Jesus Christ❤🙏
4:52 I think the doll gets herself so many haters. No wonder her hand is missing. Kidding!
I don’t understand Korean but the English translation was dog water
The first time we saw the staircases I immediately went "Escher!" It's so well done despite obviously not being able to beat gravity like Escher does.
Is it me but those english audios are so cringey like tf? Its all better in korean
die fake or not?
I am so glad I didn't watch it in English
the dub is so horseshit 😭😭😭
Wow is that it😘👍👍👍
Best movie in 2021😍
Blow up Vatican. pedo satan.
The inconclusive collision differently press because composition critically grease below a typical edge. detailed, astonishing makeup
I’m never watched the series but it looks good
Ayo did I hear English dub in the beginning?
I bet we all cried when the old man died
Can we just give them all of the Emmys and Golden Globes (and any other TV awards I cant think of right now) please?
I did not know that.
do you guys watch sub or dub? I watch sub 🤷‍♀️
There are some sets with real backgrounds
First time hearing the English voices and man.............yikes 💀☠
how you gonna record over this in a plastic box? How do you not have access to a studio with 6 million subscribers... use a closet or something at least... this is the worst voice over i have heard in so long
Why is there a engdub version???
oh my god the dubbed voice right as I clicked on the vid was like a slap to my face
I think if you watch squid game in Korean with subs it’s way better ( my opinion)
They guys really did treat MC Escher as some obscure artist, as if he's not referenced in pop culture all the time
I was so scared that I thought it was real on Netflix and thank you for showing me that its not
The glass bridge walking game is actually not hard at all ONLY IF the players think for few seconds, they can totally be safe. The rules of this game are just “take off your shoes and try to pass through the bridge”. The rules NEVER SAID something like “you can’t do this, you can’t do that…” to pass the bridge.  So if the players think for few seconds, they have a few ways to pass the bridge totally safe.  Way 1: use 1 shoe from the people and throw hard at the one of the glasses, doesn’t matter which one. The ordinary glass will break immediately or at least has shatter. There are 32 shoes (16 players), and only 20 decks (1 side), so feel free to throw.  Way 2: walk right on the 2 steel red pipes in the middle (the gap between the 2 sides of the bride) and then they can... wish this game somehow can be any harder ???  Way 3: the distance between the 2 glasses is not far, maybe around 2.5ft. So right at the first deck the player can just sit down and hit the glass in the front with the heel. The ordinary glass will break, definitely. The player can wrap around their heel with their shirt to avoid cut
The stairs were slightly less advanced then the Hogwarts stairways
As a person that watched k-dramas for years, I'm happy that 'squid game' caught international interest. Most k-dramas have such impressive storylines.
Omg i didn’t expect the dubbing. Just read the freaking subtitles people uGH
"take another throw"  Me: starts cutting off wires from the tv, breaking it and jumping off a cliff 🕳️🚶
:)
The English audio doesn’t do justice to acting of the actors pls watch in original korean audio
Squid game is more spicy than Parasite 🥵
muguang kochhi pieot siminida
If you watched this with the English dub instead of subtitles you’re a confirmed weirdo
Wait! So you're telling me most people actually watched Squid Game with English Dub??!?!?!
wow  si  a   edit🤩
PALLLAUK TU ZINAI LETUVISKAII
They should keep the set. When travelling is already allowed. Tourists will be excited to take pictures here. In New Zealand, they allowed the filming of the sequel of the Lord of the Rings if they will leave the set behind after filming. It became a tourist attraction.
Who is ur fave character guys mine is    001 the old man
Omg I never heard the English dub and I just heard it in this clip. My god that was horrible
I'm still  at jimmy because he put his fake blood on the SLID
A real set will always be the best no matter how much tech you have or a 2k, 4k, 8k, 1000k or a total matrix if you like, nothing compare to a real set, ever. So said green light red light, don't move
Man, I need to see this now.
I want more behind the scenes!!!
How did you make the person that got shot and make it to real blood ??
Man whoever put the footage in this video fucked up. The English Dub is so much worse than the Korean one.

if someone mock this series without watching it . just watch it and then say 😏😏😏 amazing show ever
I guess I'll be the first comment to say that I actually liked the English dub and people complain about the synchronisation but honestly, after a while you forget that they were actually speaking Korean originally. Subtitles are just too much to focus on and trying to watch the action at the same time.
SO SPOOKY ;)
The english dub is really triggering me
Wow they really put a lot of hard work hours, days, weeks.
Wait was satisfy me in 5 minutes real?
Ban English dubs 🥴 idk why people won’t just watch the show in the original sound you’ll learn a new language & it’s more realistic
KOREANS has already 3 Homeruns this 2021..in Music BTS, BLACK PINK n now in Movies, SQUID GAME!!!
who the fuck watch this in dub seriously, is it really that hard to read sub?, english is not my main language so almost every i watch is in sub and its okay for me
If you watch dubbed then you deserve a drop from the tug of war platform
Ost is also amazing!
Very interesting
I feel like the game is the same from the S. Korea show which is call  "Running Man Show" but different feeling. Watching Squid Game is scare feeling because if u lose the game, u will die. Watching Running Man show is funny feeling because if u lose the game, u will get penalty.
only big bois can watch squid game without the english dub
english dub yuk
Güzel dizi
best show of 2021
Actually, I have noticed most of this things, with my father.
Balik nyo kaba ko yawa
Why the heck was this dub? Can people not read English? Multitask? Ugh.
Amazing
I can like probably survive on the glass thingy game bc o can see the glasses skin color that may help me survive
YUH
Show behind the scenes detracts from the value of the series
Why do I see in the old man died in the honeycomb game!?
Squid game be like: win thus game to get 100,000,000,000 dollers
serie muito boa ❤❤
do they actually die in this?
Do yourselves a favor and watch with subtitles.
The English dub makes me wanna throw up. 🤮 LOL
Im so sorry I just really hate the dub
Squid game will always be a special show
I bet kira yoshikage stole that hand
BEST  DRAMA… EVER…!
Cool
omg please tell me i'm not the only one who first realized after watching the full serie that you could see it in english??! :))
I'm glad people have been talking about the sets because they are breathtaking! I loved the playground and the first game even if it's very minimalistic. I love how Korea or any other shows from outside the U.S are very imaginitive since all shows nowadays are always set with green screens.
If you watched this show in English you are not an intellectual
Cool
Please don't watch dub 😭😭
I actually noticed the hidden message on the wall thing
Tug-of-war deadly game
Nice video
I really like the little hints at what the games are like the art on the walls in the dorms they all have the games layed out
I wish all asian movie makers has this same quality
the dub 💀 imagine watching the series with a damn dub... waste of time
big quistion did the people realy die
WAIT DID THE PEOPLE REALLY DIE CUZ IF SO THAT MEANS THAT THE ACTERS OF THE GARDS MUDERED PEOPLE sorry caps
tbh squid game wasn’t all the hype, i watched it with my sister, it’s good but not worth all the hype it’s getting

Disliked because of that horrendous Dub
This series is an absolute masterpiece isn’t it?
I turn off the video right after i hear that dubbed voice😒
Respect to the Koreans for putting in so much hard work and effort. 👏🏼

This feels so good seeing the behind
it much better with actual voices not someone also
I think its telling that people love Kshows and movies so much. The work that has been successful has been fresh, new ideas that haven't been done before... I think its telling that there is a high demand for more ideas/concepts
only legend knows where the girl with a curly hair hides her cigarettes
Squid game is overrated.
Ew..... sorry its dubbed
was the audio recorded in a fishbowl wtf
fall guys
Omg I love this show and your vids
Some of my homies told about the series  and said watch this squid game is sick
am i the only one who didn't find this show anything special??? like wtf is this so popular.?
This series makes me hard its that good
This should win an Oscar
'Squidgame' was rejected for 10 years by investors and actors who thought the script was 'wierd'.
putting in the hard work with the sets and characters really did this series justice, all of that stuff costs blood sweat and tears and obviously money, that in turn created one of the greatest series/showings this generation has seen in a long time. this goes to show that hard work truly does pay off, whether it’s now or later. thank you koreans, love from the states.
2:48 THATS WGAT I THOUGHT THEYWERE AT FIRST, WITG THE UPSIDE DOWN ABF STUFF
just amazing
I know squid game why they have money on squid game i really need to play the on real life but is kind of creepy and i don't like money now for game if there's a man calling me hey you want some money i will say yes but if there's a squid ring i will member that

Squid game is all over tiktok😂
If the Koreans keep putting out stuff like this they’re gonna need a theme park.
Wow, when Cr1t1kal said the dub was "extraordinarily goofy," he wasn't kidding.
Squid Game is just Mr. Beast with extra steps.
Quite a good watch didn’t think I’d like squid game thought it was a knockoff saw.
fun fact : this was made in 2009 but apparently it was too violent . (pls don’t attack me if they mention this cuz I haven’t watched the whole video)
Best program.on netflix
All the efforts put in is amazing, everything was built from scratch
I mean.. Squid game is a masterpiece
plot twist: the contestants included thr cameraman was also playing with them.
The dubd version is just horrible
Red light green light is better than all the others
7:31 The face lol I died XD

Bro, this series is a Masterpiece and I'm so glad that it getd the attention it deserves. Everyone in my country is watching it and usually, they aren't even watching asian series "))
bruh just wanted to actually see the scene not watch a whole documentary ;/
Bruh
As a Korean, English dubbing sounds so so terrible and goofy.
Okayyy
Information about real life Disney princess please ask me
Great to see another category from South Korea becoming a big hit world wide. BTS, Blackpink, Parasite winning Oscars and now Squid game series.
it became cringe when they started putting english dubs. Subs is great and it is enough. but english dub is so cringe
Red light green light
We dated for over a year and were each other's best friends, we completely understand each other, and we are still madly in love with each other, but it was best for us to break up because we weren't in the same place. She's 20 and wants to be married and have kids soon, and I'm 21 and wanted to date her for a while and get married and have kids around age 30. It was mutual and we both knew it was best for us, so we decided one day to break up. On the last day of our relationship, I decided to take her out on one last date night. We spent the entire date thinking back and talking about favorite times together, things we'll miss about each other, how we've affected each other's lives in so many good ways. I bought her flowers, took her to a nice romantic restaurant with live music, and went to see The Hobbit, through all of which we held hands. It was one of the most perfect, romantic, happy, and yet heartbreaking dates we ever had. At the end of the night, we said our goodbyes as we hugged and kissed passionately for one last time and went our separate ways, never to see each other again. It was the hardest thing I've had to do to this date, but I wouldn't want it to end any other way. It was as perfect as a heartbreak could be....
Squid game most definitely getting a second season
Tell Me I’m not the only one to keeps the language to Korean bc I hate dubbed-
People discussing whether or not you should watch the show in Korean with subtitles. Me, living in the Netherlands, where all movies in foreign languages (including English) are subtitled: "Wait, what? Is this a serious discussion?"  ..  Why would you not want to watch something in it's original language?? I've been looking at subtitles for 40+ years now. .. Btw even when I watch an English spoken movie and there are no subtitles available in my native language, I still put on the English subtitles.  Sometimes things are just difficult to hear. Especially in action packed flicks. .. I just don't get what the deal is with people who think subtitles are stupid.
bro i have all the sqiud games kinds in roblox lol😆😆
I LOVED Squid Games! Who does too?
ngl first thing that came to my mind when looking at the stair room is Yu-Gi-Oh, Yami Yugi's mind room or smthin like that.
Is this horror or no
WHY TF ARE THE CLIPS IN DUB, RESPECT THE ORIGINAL PERFORMANCES, ESPECIALLY IN A BTS VIDEO
Red Light Of Glass Tug Marble Game

Who actually watch this show with English dub 😂 it was so much better in Korean with subtitles
Hi
fake booooooooo
But......
I TOTALLY THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS REAL
HEH...
Poor Ali 😢
I need to chill after watching this https://youtu.be/aJulFLrPAP8
AS A MALAYSIAN I'M REALLY JEALOUS HOW FAR SOUTH KOREA HAS ACCOMPLICHT

I feel like season 2 may be focused on those who didn’t return after the vote.
Who knew about M.C Echer from Family Guy
Nunggu orang indo komen 🔥🔥
Here from Squid Game
Green light vs red light
im so glad this got the credit it deserves!👏👏
NOOO NOT THE ENGLISH, it’s so much better in korean cause it’s the original
I don't even see the purpose of the stairs besides pure aesthetics.
Njer
I THOUHGT IT WAS ALL REAL BUT NO ONE DIES!?!?
Prior to Ali. He did a great job!
Man. This show was cared for.🔥
I know many people are saying it is awesome for watching this in original Korean with English subtitles, but the problem is that you will just watch the bottom on the screen while struggling to find what is above the subtitles, that is why I watched the series in English dubbed throughout the series. I understand and respect your opinion though.
I feel attacked for watching it in dub
The amount of hardwork that they have put into this series is mind-blowing! From real sets to acting. They nailed it. I'm so glad that the show is finally getting the attention that it deserved.
The budget for this series must have cost a fortune but it was definitely worth it.
I'm so glad squid game got as popular as it did It's _exactly_ the kind of show I like
Why is it the eng version 😭😭
I love red light green light , I HATE honeycomb challenge
the fact that my class did this in recess time (im in 6th grade, btw i don't know why people say you don't have recess in middle school, in some schools you do)
why did americans have to dub this show
We were playing this in school in recess and literally the play ground was empty
If you're watching with English audio, then you are watching a different story than the original Korean audio. Even some of the English subtitles don't match what is said in Korean.
Can anyone guess how far the drop was for the tug of war game?
Such a great series. Proud of all that Korea is achieving on the international stage 🌎❤👏
Am I the only one that thought of the labyrinth with those stairs?
This series is so brilliant its my second rewatch wow the acting is amazing the first episode got me hooked I was like wow this opened up to make me look at other Korean dramas its so popular where I am.
@TheThings If you're going to do a piece about a foreign show use the original footage with subtitles.  The writer, actors, directors, set people...etc, put a lot of effort to really bring those words to life - and though a translation in a subtitle may not be perfect, the LEAST you can do it show it as it originally is.  If people want to enjoy it when they watch it in dubbed, that's their business, but if YOU'RE doing a piece about that show (or any show in a non-english language) then respect their hard work enough to show the original.
Wtf is this dub trash. Show the original. And  also, show the scenes. No one cares about the narration.
I love how the massacre during red light green light was all cgi XD ( it actually was frightening
i was excited to watch this video and then you used the english dub, will not be watching!
Everyone hates sang woo here, but watch prison playbook, ull love him
Wow it's great to see the behind the scenes 🤩I got really inspired by the Squid Game atmosphere so I decided to try to remix the "Red Light Green Light" in an Uplifting Trannnnnce ;) What do you guys think ? https://youtu.be/LIQ3SKvxtXA
Great show great actors
Show is terrible in English but this was interesting 🧐
I felt like this video just kept repeating things to make it longer when it could have been half as long.
The artistic stairs really give my the Simpsons house vibes
What episode is this?
222@
무궁화꽃이 피었습니다😏✌✌✌
i prefer watching squid games in there but own language
this was brought out in 2015 thats crazzyyy only getting aired now
I hate the sound of this series im sorry 🥲🥲🥲🥲
On the beds: "they were actually made out of the same materials as tunnels"  wtf does that mean?
Wait...what the hell?? They make a dub?!
NO NOT THE ENGLISH DUB
Woah, looks good.
Tug of war
"some of the sets were made just for the show"... yea that's kinda how it works.
People who watch Squid Games in DUB are the same people you never chose during Popcorn Reading as a kid. Ahhahahahha
Indonesia subtitle pliss 🙏
squid game
Ugh, the English voices are so garbage and I don’t know how anyone could watch it that way.
English Dub ?? pathetic. Just read the subtitles like a normal person.
I like the first “l have a question”
7:24 is definitely not Daejeon, that was Yoido of Seoul.
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈
Wow didnt know englisch dubbing is that bad
halloween 2021
Wow! 😱
Squid Game Is one of the best kdrama ever  They never disappoint
They just want to show you this to convince you it wasn’t actually a documentary….
People watching voice overs are crazy. I don’t speak 1 word of Korean but why would you watch dubbed...
Nice
Omg that production budget must’ve been huge
do pepple relly die in squid game?
Wow this channel really just ripped off the Netflix Channel who did a behind the scenes.  Congrats on stealing content!!!!! @netflix asia
Ew dub 🤢
Imagine watching this dubbed
I think this game old ?
YOU NEED MILK
There is one in roblox
BIG DOLL?
So weird hearing the English dub
Who else realised there is a circle triangle and square button on your phone
Director impressed with money heist that’s y he tried to give this kind of series😱
Wait? This was dubbed?
I have one question did they die?
Impressive!
The last episode is a disaster LOL. What happened?
The dub is awful
7:20 Did anyone see that post in the background fall over?
No one cares if u watched it in dub or sub.. no one
Someone played too much Minecraft....thats how they came up with the stairs lol
Sure for their hard work  they have achieved
Why is it dubbed in English 🥴. It's better to hear them in their language and just read the subtitles
I enjoyed this show
Its worth it 🤩
Do yourself a favour and dont watch dubbed
Who watches it in English. Their voices sound so off. I watched it in English for about 20 seconds and I was like nope back to Korean
I wanna see videos of behind the scenes not someone talking about the show the whole time
Similar version of saw
I like that they didn't destroy the game at the end with the police officer manage to send all the evidence and expose the game. Most movies or series will stop the cycle at the end. They also kept that only 1 player wins and left everything as it is.
0:00  yes i love it
The set design in this show is AMAZING
I know why player 456 is a player in that smacking game he pick blue
I instantly thought the marbles set would be the best paintball/airsoft place ever!!
"The actor who played No.1 had a really intense nostalgic reaction when filming the marbles game" ...  "I once played Marbles. So it reminded me of the past"
i love u pak you
https://youtu.be/GtvqZMxRlc4 OMG 😱😱😱😱😱
Er why the dub?
budget mode lol,
So does this mean that the other players are still alive if not I would literally cry for the rest of my life
Trend on roblox
most overrated show i think ever made. police had no meaning, end twist so predictable, no explanation to anything, why are they working there for example?
Not cut scenes from the dub 🙄 for anyone who hasn't watched it yet don't watch the dub
idk how people are watching and loving a show where its dubbed over. its so awful and out of place
increíble la cantidad de escenografías que tiene toda la serie en todos los capitulos
F's for the people who watched the dubbed version of this show 😭
awww daejeon is where my parents are from <3 that's their hometown. i loved how they included characters in the show who were from different places, too. so wild, such an amazing show!
Beautiful movie??? What?? How?? Seeing people being killed??the story is all about love of money..greed..THE LOVE OF MONEY IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL!!!!!
Huh I never knew there was a English dubbed version? It sounds really off after I've seen it with the original korean audio.
Love thissss
This series is my childhood nightmares come to life
Real problem is almost of them are male ! Scary situation.
Why is the guard red like red light and the player green like green light?🤔🤔
English dub just doesn't sound right :p
The 7th floor scene was the 7th game. There was a time, and Ill-Nam lost as he died.               Ilnam was absolutely convinced on the selfish nature of humans and that they possessed views that the lives of others was of little significance compared to their gains (which is why he voted for them all to go home as he was convinced they would eventually come back). he probably made a similar bet(probably more elaborate when he wasnt confined to his deathbed) and endowed this ideology to the guy in the black mask when he won in 2015, causing him to forfeit his life(symbolically die) and become devoted to Ilnam and help run the games. I am thinking that the guy in the station with the red and blue tags is another previous winner/devotee that has lost the 7th game to Ilnam. (these are my speculations, the show doesnt really suggest this) But with the case of gihun, he is a broke fool who seems to have a childish innocence contrary to the events surrounding him and it is initially presented as his biggest character flaw. But in essence his character is living proof against ilnams convictions of the world, which is why ilnam lost the final bet.       Characters are undone by their flaws    If there is an underlying theme in this show, it is that the characters are all undone by their flaws.    -After the first game when the characters resume their lives before reentering the game, Sangwoo tries to commit suicide by drowning himself in his tub, he ends up killing himself in the same position with rain falling on his face, his flaw being that he would rather avoid his problems til the end than face them. He is extremely capable and clever but refuses to own up to his mistakes and relies on unethical means to fix them (He would rather commit suicide than confront his mother about his wrongdoings).   -Saebyuk threatens the broker at knife point to the neck and she dies with a stabwound to the neck in the same spot, her flaw is her unrealistic/childish expectations (she still takes the broker's words and says she will get the money/her expectations of being with her illegal North Korean parents who have been arrested and sent back/ wanting to live normally with her family which is her motivation in the whole game)    -Ali is taken advantage of by his employee and ends up having to resort to using his strength to forcibly take his money and ends up crushing his employer's hands. He dies by sangwoo taking advantage of his naivety and stealing his marbles. His biggest flaw is that he is naïve and too trusting. (it is also implied that he has lost fingers in a similar way while working for the scumbag employer showing how naive he was)    -The gangster dude has to jump off a bridge at a dead end of his own making. He dies falling off a bridge treading on glass steps. His flaw is acting wrecklessly for his own gains at the cost of others, only to have it fall back on him.    Every single character in the show dies without recognizing and surpassing their flaws, in fact you could say their deaths are their own doing.        The Red herring     The image in the last round of the games With GiHun fighting Sangwoo with a knife(and sneakily throwing sand in his eyes) is a stark contrast between his character in episode one with his childlike innocence(refer to the smile for his profile). We as viewers assume that he has developed and overcome his flaw to prevail as any main protagonist would  And it would have also tied up the social commentary of the show nicely, albiet would have been a tragic one of how growing up in society we often end up abandoning our humanity. The show sets you up to believe that that is the main theme of the show and what is being represented by the game and its participants until the very last moment.  but its not    with a series of plotwists he tries to forfeit the money to save sangwoo (even though it doesnt work) and it ultimately shows that he remains the innocent protagonist we saw in the beginning  at this moment as viewers we get to see that Gihun has not gone through the character development we anticipated. Afterall, most of us had already realized that the last game would be the squid game as shown in the first scene in the show where there could only be one winner and incapacitation of the other player would not be avoidable. But Gi-hun does win. He is the last surviving player yet he has not changed in any meaningful way a protagonist would have to overcome their endeavors, but just ends up as a broken man (the money loses value to him). It is a stark plot twist of its own    It is also important to note that Gihun has won the game without killing a single person. His attempt to trick ilnam with the marbles does not get fully realized as being murderous as ilnam points out he knew he was being tricked, just before giving him the last marble as a sign of forgiveness/respect. He beats up sangwoo with murderous intent but ends up forfeitting in an attempt to save him. He swears he will kill Ilnam if he wins the bet but Ilnam draws his final breath upon losing, taking revenge away from him and preserving his "innocence."        The true flaw and the real herring    Upon rewatching it is clear what Gihun's main character flaw really is and it is further clarified with the last few scenes that his flaw is his drive to get back at those who have wronged him.    -When he finally wins against the man in the station, he automatically assumes to hit him when the rules was that he would get money instead.  -When he promises not to harrass the girl for his stolen money if she unties him and he falls back on that as soon as she cuts his arms free.  - When he realizes Ilnam was the mastermind behind the games he says to him that he will die by his hands if he wins the last bet.  -And finally when he stops the new recruit from calling the number by using force and taking the business card from him.Hhe recognizes how much he regrets entering the game himself and how gravely wronged he was by being talked into it. This realization is so strong that he ends up forfeiting his new life with his daughter to find those responsible.    The physical representation of change shown as the new hairstyle/color is a red herring to falsely signify that he has gone through a profound transformation as he makes rounds to respect the last wishes of saebyuk and sangwoo. But, it can actually be a representation of his inability to forget the tragic events of the games. The red can be taken as anger/revenge/trauma or some kind of newfound drive or to represent the red color of the game associates or perhaps the red tag to play the slapping game which caused him to join the game. And fittingly, In the Final scene when it is time for Gihun to get his closure, he calls the number and says he cannot forgive them and is seen walking away from the plane(his changed future) as one final plot twist.  It is understood then that his story arc is not yet complete, just like all the other contestants he is still driven by his flaw, the game continues, and his end is yet to be seen.           On an interesting speculative side note:    You could argue that Gihun was more a successful antagonist to Ilnam than he was to him. I believe Ilnam wanted to die playing the games, reliving his childhood innocence that he lost while growing up and accumulating wealth, instead dying alone in his deathbed.(note he would have died if he lost the tug of war and they were all games he played when he was a child) But his encounter with Gi hun and his seemingly preserved innocence/humanity must have touched him in some way, or sparked a newfound interest.(note he says playing with him made him remember things from his distant past that he had forgotten) When Gi hun had one marble left it was up to Ilnam to win as the answer would have inevitably been "odd" and Ilnam would have taken the last marble. But he unimmersed himself from the game that he so desperately set up for himself and let Gihun win, all the while preserving his innocence by not letting gihun win through deception, but by an understanding of mutual respect. And moments before he draws his last breath, he is proven wrong by the kind act of a bystander that turns to help an unconscious man in the streets (note the bystander initially tries to rob the homeless man) Whether Ilnam witnessed and acknowledged that he was wrong is up to the interpretation of the viewers, but if it had been clarified in the show that the losing of the bet changes Ilnam's perspective (regardless of whether he dies after or not) would almost certainly make him a successful protagonist who, throughout the course of the story, is changed.    As a viewer i do believe Ilnam's perspective was shifted whether he saw the result of the bet or not because gihun's example had already influenced Ilnam to change his focus from immersing in the game he set up for himself to letting gihun win (perhaps to preserve gihun). The scene shortly after, he is seen removing his vip mask and informing the other vip's that he does not wish to participate in watching the rest of the games. I believe the final game he sets up at the 7th f loor is partially a last desperate attempt before death to prove to himself of his own convictions, only to be proven wrong, making him a true tragic protagonist who lost his humanity as a victim of society only to witness a glimpse of it moments before death or to die stubbornly trying to prove himself right until the last breath.
Do u just censored the gun? tf
In the final game you could see the creepy doll in the background 😬😬 that gaved me guess bumps that looked so scary 😰😰
is there a place i can watch the behind scenes footage without the cringey voice over
After watching this I could sleep peacefully
i love this movie so nice
Now i know how they die
Okay, but I'm not trying to be rude or anything. But I feel like the English version is just 100% worse. The character's real voices suites with their character. And you can see that they didn't bother too much with the English voice-acting, like people keeping on talking about how the voice actors really couldn't give a fuck. I feel like the show would show so much better, with the real version. And of course, you can have captions. It's not that hard to read! And don't take me for the bad, I don't mind people using English sound, But I'm just saying that I wouldn't recommend it if you haven't watched Squid Game before! Thank you, and please don't take me for bad :)
The fact that they put so much work into their scenes makes the show so much better.
this show got me in the feelings like no other show or film has but did anyone else find the ending of the show a bit frustrating? i had a hunch the old man was part of the games but for him to die without giving the answer after losing the bet really bummed me out
4:47 the camera operator also participate in this game 😂
Wiow
just a guess, but actually building all these props and rooms were probably much cheaper than creating all of them with CGI and editing and such.
Wow, the show sounds super whack in English dub. Can't tell if it's because of the high bar of brilliant acting that the on-screen Korean cast set or because the dub is just not that good.
Watching dubbed stuff is so 20 years ago.......  doesn't sound realistic AT ALL. Why would u want to hear some other actors' voices instead of the original??? Makes NO SENSE
HahAha no me and the kids to bed early last night was the first place in a relationship and I'm so happy that I 6A to the gym at work now so I'm going to
What A Series.MY GOD.MASTERpiece indeed
I do love Squid game and here I draw Sae Byeok actor in Squid game 💞  Here : https://youtu.be/bzks5hvt9GI  😍💘
I’d love to Play😂
The acting in this show was phenomenal!  It's almost a must imo to go with the Korean audio and English subtitles.  Trust me, it's much better that way and you'll forget you're even reading after not long.
Hello.
They steal the story from kaiji anime !! Lol
I’m disgusted by the dub it doesn’t match
Ame esta serie es mucho mejor verla en su idioma original pero con subtitulos ♥️
Did you know there is a cartoon channel that is called Zig and Sharko that in one episode they played the doll game but the lose was different so you have to restart everything by going back from the track.
This show is lit.
fun facts: u just finish watched squid game the next day... ur friend will talk about squid game
Hoping for season 2
this game is easy!
Absolutely brilliant work
I love how the show squid game got so much attention, and it was the proper attention it deserves! I also love how the fact they were able to make the tense situations feel so realistic and practically could see the terror in the actors eyes
Love the show!  Am I the only one who actually doesn't understand the rules of Squid Game? Like the actual game, Squid Game.
Can I borrow some of your time? Can you please rate my Squid Game Keychain that i made, so that I will know if I can improve my skills or not. Feel free to comments on my video even if it is harsh. Promise i will not be offended. Thank You.
everybody gangsta until pink guy points a gun at you
I think the doll said "kokola kucing tiang bendera"
Welcome everyone
Please watch me making a video of Squid Game with Baby 오징어 게임 무궁화 꽃이 피었습니다
the english dub was so bad
just put the show in korean and add subtitles u whitewashed pieces of shit
This show was so good, i was already addicted in the first episode!
I know the squit game is dangerous
the fact that you watched it in dub makes me disappointed in you.
Nice 🙂😌
digital special effects ≠ cgi
I liked red light green light cause it was simple and fun but it was also a simple game where all you had to do was follow the instructions as said but instead people wanted to freak out and die cause they ran thinking they’d just be let out😂
We need season 2 now
One question if we win just how much do we get?
nah
obviously all the sets & props were made just for the show, it's common sense
green light reply to move
Shit. You know I REALLY like something when I'm searching "behind the scenes" videos 🥴  Did anyone think for a SECOND at that last scene that he was going to go back to be a "bad guy"?
No bc the crazy toilet girl's bf posted on Instagram and the caption is "thank u for making me a millionaire"
god, the dub sounds so bad 😭
ㅋㅋㅋ 영어더빙 어마어마 하네 ㅋㅋㅋ
Bullshit
Cool Video
They put out alot of effort /money into this. It paid off! This show caught fire
Here 5 hours after this was posted!
What sister dolls

이것은 한국 드라마이다
only me who got annoyed that he applied to play again instead of getting on the plane to see his KIDS-?
Can U keep on doing Harry Potter stuff plssssss?
Imagine in a plane and flying across squid game red light green light in the making lol
It’s much better with their actual voices with subtitles.
Yogoma go shi indeshandage
godddd we need a season 2
I literally just watched it and wanted to know how all these incredible scenes were done. And here this video is! in the heat of the heat
Player 243 eliminated
i love how we've all become obsessed with Squid Game lol
it looks like fancy prison show
awesome!
Imagine watching it in fucking dub
ya'll are wrong for using the eng dub
original sound with sub is the best version for me 100%
eh?  pano ba yung lolo binaril at yung.  Kapatid ng babae binaril din sa squid game
I loved this show. I loved the staircases set the most but all of the sets were amazing.
I have to watch two ads just to watch this video
Damn this cool
I know I’m not the only one who finished the whole season in one day???
PlayStation button masks be like
I feel bad for the old man 😭
don't think the guys understand what non cgi means
I wanna watch squid game but I don’t have netflix
jugaremooos muevete luz verde
Please do yourselves a favour and watch in Korean with subtitles; the dub actors are no where near half as good as the actual actors.
1:09 067
I'm sorry? No CGI in the first game? Do you think that giant blue screen replaces itself?
Yohh the setting was everything🔥
Omg I did not know that she is a doll
Do they really die on this game show or is it just acting I'm confused ???????
It's cool to see how all of this went down, but I don't have a good feeling about this......and I mean from most people

Just finished it and it was the best series I saw
Why is everyone getting so triggered over people that are watching it in English 🤣 darling if I wanted to watch a series I don’t understand and read sentences off the bottom of a screen I’d buy a kindle, stay mad
Its the first time i hear the english dub…and it sucks ugh
It sounds soooo much better watching it in korean with subtitles🔥
Reall wanted Sae-Byeok to win😤
squid game

Not many people know this, but *Season 2* of *Squid game* is acutally coming out soon! It’s stated by the creators in this video: https://youtu.be/Ns13VjwUGd4
So cool
Who watched in English tho 🤢🤢
Did they actually die
I need to watch this
the colorful stairs remind me of something out of a Dr. Suess book
This is amazing fr
Let’s be honest we all where mad about episode 8
Bro, this series is a Masterpiece and I'm so glad that it gets the attention it deserves. Everyone in my country is watching it and usually, they aren't even watching asian series "))
Love from india

Wow
Squid Game is one of the most sinister shows Netflix has ever given us, so it's nice to see the cast and crew having fun behind the scenes.  Since the series is so relentlessly horrifying it's quite soothing to see the cast and crew messing about on set during what looks like a fairly calm (dare we say boring?) moment.
Hi
Love ur vids

It’s so good looking
Woah :O

Squid Game is like an homage to those strange underwater creatures that undulate below the sea. It's actually a compelling, candy-coated fever dream in which contestants play the innocent games from their childhood with one major change: if they lose, their lives are forfeit.
Can you comment on this video? Love your video's 🥰
