6:08  Directed by David Lynch
it was cute he gave the cousins a hug. Bet that was more special experience than actually getting a ticket!
Honestly The Title is Misleading. It wasn’t Joe Lacey who broke Send to All if anyone it was the Audience Member who broke Send to All
How’s your Nan?
Joe Lycett and Michael McIntyre where comedy goes to die
That's actually really lovely!!
😂😂😂
Why do I always enjoy anything involving Lycett 😂
Haha omfg the Double Dutch guy is there too
"How's your nan?" is the summer hit of 2025.
I still have 20 years of contacts thanks to google contacts and the like, if i did this not even my parents would show up let alone other people
where's full video?
I would love it if someone threw a party for evertyone in my phone. I wouldn't throw one but i would check out someone else's
it's than a minute in and I want to go to that party
Joe Lycett is just chaos incarnate. His time on Taskmaster was brilliant. The audience members sending their cousins is 100% Lycett energy
But u invited Joel’s whole phone, to a room of 30?
That’s sooo in keeping with Joe’s energy though 😂😂😂
If they did this with my phone they will have to dig most of them up to attend as most of my friends are incognito
How’s Your Nan is an unironic banger 😂😂😂
Joe is such a character!
roflmao cousins! broke the system
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I really needed that today... excellent!
That was so much better than Joe having them in his phone and having no clue who they are 😂 you can’t get into the show but you get to meet Joe Lycett? Done deal
the cousins i cannot 😭😭😭
"How's your nan?" oh my goodness! I was laughing so hard!
Hah is that the Double Dutch TikTok guy?
How's your nan? is such a banger, i genuinely love it
i wish the audience would like... not. It ruins the plan.
I think you should get Jimmy Carr on this he would be fantastic and then you would have had both the Carrs on the show :) hehe
I wish Liz truss had shown up I’d love to see her at a party having fun
Ok so, completely out of the main point but, does anyone know, Joe Lycett’s jacket, where’s it / who’s it from?
That’s freaking funny
If I were those audience members I would have stayed silent.
I wish I took part in Send to All, It'd be proper hilarious
I'm sure the cousins were glad to not get tickets, they got to hug Joe Lycett
I have zero clue who this guy is, but I love Michael and, now, the audience members who sent the invite! 😂
That was so so ace, mint and awesome that was. Flipping fantastic. Best one.
IS THAT DOUBLE DUTCH??
6:10 Michael’s dancing just make me realise, he looks like a chubby Rick Astley 😂
Oh that was hilarious - loved the cousins!!!
I wonder how those cousins felt when they watched this clip and saw that he admitted not recognizing them?  Also, I wonder if they blurred out the lady in the back because she didn't want to be on camera or the production crew didn't get her to sign a release?
I saw will wood and was shocked for a moment
Lowkey loved his phone wallpaper, I wonder where it's from
Hilarious 😂
Was this filmed on 6 November? Because I was at a podcast recording where they mentioned that Joe was showing an impromptu party that night and but they couldn't go.
He's at the Hare & Hounds Kings Heath tonight (1st Feb).
Love UK comedy shows. It shows the same 5 or 6 "comedians/celebrities" self indulging themselves. Haven't all these people been on shows the past 10 years. Same group rehashed into something "new". Maybe they can get say 10 comedians into a room to see who will be the last one to laugh......wait for it, will be a smash hit.
He hugged the cousins lol
😂😂😂😂😂😂
How does Michael McIntyre have a show and Joe doesn'tt?
I love this show. It takes away anything bad going on in my life and just takes me to happy place of giggles 😅
Such a rich history of original comedy on the BBC....and then this utter crap.
How is this chap still getting my license fee.
Love Michael but can never understand the Joe Lycett appeal, he just always seems like genuinely quite a nasty catty guy who just wants to ruin people's days whenever he can :/ get such a bad vibe from him
I love Joe, he’s the funniest incredibly right wing comedian of all time!
Send to all option doesn’t exist on any phone
God UK TV has gone to the dogs.
Hysterical
this actually turned out better, then I thought... still: is there anything stupid enough to not be shown on british television?
I’m still waiting for my invitation…😂
As a fan of the musician Will Wood I got very excited for a second there
It was good how they dismantled it, but hard to understand what the intent of the prank was.
5:29 That one woman face blurred, I suspect the guy she's with may not be her husband lol
Where can we get "How's Your Nan?"
song is low key a banger!! 6:08
I honestly can't believe that people enjoy this crap
😂😂
Epic stuff. 🤣  Class jacket also Joe.
Shoutout the cousins for breaking the system! Cheers!
Omg its the @letsdoubledutch guy
Dear me! Brilliant!
This was fantastic!! Joe basically lives for chaos and breaking systems (at least that's what he shows us 😂) so the joy on his face when it happened... I couldn't stop laughing! 😂
I really hope Joe added the cousins to his contact list.
I really enjoyed watching that. My only complaint is that it was way too short!
What did I just watch??
Can't believe he has the same phone he's had since he was 16
That is a piss poor turn out 😂
Definitely not staged at all 🙄
Utter pish
I’ve written the next line of :How’s your nan?”………”She’s dead”
The fact he hugged the 2 people he didnt know :D
I swear this segment has me evaluate my phone contacts each time I see it.
How was his nan tho
Like if you think he should officially release 🎼 nan
Hows your nan doing? I just LOVE IT 😅
Lycett is a level of Joy all his own.  then you ball him up with McIntyre and the fun turns to Chaos in the first 1/2 breath.   LOL   I knew I get some laughs from this one,   Thanks Crew for posting the Fun.!!!
DEFUND THE BBC
I loved the show last night and laugh at the good humrour. God it been a few years to laugh watching a show.
How's yu nan was surprising catchy
The guy is the white striped shirt...is that the "Double Dutch" comedian guy??!
You really need to do a send to all that damages relationships.  like a text to a celebrity's better half that they have been cheating for 3 years at least, if they've been together longer. Even though it most likely would be a lie.  That would be funny
@spencerjones... Dyaremembermynan?
Hahaha that was brilliant.  I'm not surprised Joe's family are equally as fantastic.  I love 'hows your nan?'
This song should be in every Indian restaurant by the end of the week 😂 how’s ya naan?
This was a weird stunt, without the audience inviting people, what was funny about it? They turned up and then what? Nothing happened?
Siht S.T.A!! 2/10
Hi.  This has been a Google Algorithm Bubble  situation.  Working on it just now.  At some point I will not be censored or punished for being honest about my experience.
I like that the girl who works on his show apparently didn’t give permission to be filmed and is the only one blurred…
Ofcourse no Father figure.
Show is absolute shite
Hilarious!
Drivel.
Starmer will bring the pizza
HAHAHAHA
Fakest cringiest shit ever. Anything on TV nowadays lol
Interesting, someone is pixelated.
I was not prepared for the ending.
I love Joe Lycett and I've been waiting for this "Send to All"
OT: Benny Hill considered funnier than Monty Python by two TV stations--WOR and WLVI!
💜🌟Love Joe, what a star!🌟💜
If that's all that turned up he isn't to popular with the people on his phone lol
I thought Michael was going to punch the audience who invited their own family to his private party idea
Joe suddenly looks a lot older all of a sudden..
Ok, this might be my white wine spritzer talking, but this is the best send to all, full stop
😂😂😂😂😂😂🙈🙈🙈🙈❤❤❤❤ I love it so much. 😂😂😂
If the audience members hadn't invited their cousins, this would have been the most pointless 'Send to All' ever!
Joe Lycett DIDN'T break it - the AUDIENCE did!
Not many turned up to the party. I reckon I'd have got more 😂
NOT THE AUDIENCE INVITING THEIR FAMILIES!!!!!!!!!!!!
I Love Joe lycett I loved you watching you on there Joe hope to see you On unexpected star of the show it might happen cant believe you dyed your hair its nice
That looks like the dullest party ever.  As if his real friends are gonna suddenly gonna go for this    🙄
Hows ya nan 😂😂😂 bitta me that lol
This show is fake and scripted
Brilliant 😂😂😂
This was hilarious, when the audience  invited their family   to the invitation 🤣🤣🤣🤣
How's your nan? is quite genuinely a banger
I love Joe
MM has slowed down a bit, hasn't he? I still fondly remember his "five spice" sketches.
Let's party Lycett 1999
need 'hows your nan' on Spotify tbh
Gay v gay
Lycett would love a tory party conference party.  He is, after all, very right wing.
I love whoever made that announcement graphic, "Let's party Lycett 1999", brilliant :D Also love the audience members breaking the format :D
They’re out of ideas
How’s your nan doing?
Lmao🎉
I think Jen Ives was there.
I wish there was a way to get the full episodes in the States.
When the audience outwits Michael. Way to go, cousins!
That's the way ,ahu ahu, Joe Lycett. Ahu ahu.
Brilliant
