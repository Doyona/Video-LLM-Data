12:00 HELPEODJD
WE LOVE U NICOLEEEEEE.
It's crazy because this my first video watching you, & it said birthing Messiah which is one of my twins names who I gave birth to in 2017. & When you said "Malachi can you hand me an outfit" I laughed because that's my Twin sons other brother name. My twins are named Malaki (Malachi) & Messiah. I was going to sell my son Malaki name like Malakai, but I didn't want my family friends to think I was copying them, (I was not lol) I already had a daughter named Aiyana & they also had a daughter named Aiyana 😆 so I was thinking the least I could do is take the A out of the Kai lol. I preferred Malakai, but I stuck with Malaki. I kinda regret not adding in the A because that is the preferred spelling I had in mind, but I stuck with I. Anyway, Malachi in the Bible translates to "the messenger" & Messiah translates to "the Savior." I am actually kind of happy I stumbled upon your video 😊❤ congrats 👏🏻
Can these people just use normal names for children 🙄
1:00
Well, at the ending, she said it was pretty good. I just don’t like having to stay at the hospital. I wanna go home.😂😂
Definition of hey you'll be okay baby it's okay baby thank you so relaxed
It's nasty stuff you you know hospital nothing else nothing nothing don't ever ever say that word
Be careful how you take care of your baby shower and your babies I love it

Is it a boy or a girl? What’s the name?❤❤❤❤

I went into labour at home and didn't even make it out the car park of the hospital before I heard a pop and that was my water breaking and 2 mins later I delivered my daughter. She wasn't breathing at first but after I sucked the gunk out her nose and mouth she was able to breathe .  You're dam right Queen 👑 ,we don't make these babies alone 😔. You're a very unique person.
Telling someone who's is labour to calm down , is like telling someone to not breath . You slayed that girl

Congratulations
I love this so much, I had my baby 9 months ago. I was told at my pre admission appointment that I was allowed to record but when it came down to it, my mom had her phone out and got the perfect shot of my sons head crowning and some volunteer nurse started talking shit in the background about “I didn’t think they were allowed to do that” when the nurse she was talking to was focused on my contractions. My mom stopped recording because of that so we missed getting him coming out on video
How cute is he? Just was born and smiling up a storm. How adorable.
For real .
Martin Dorothy Hernandez Sandra Taylor Scott

How beautiful with my daughter I was in labor for 24 hours it was complicated had the epidural ran fever also so she had to go to the NICU for a week never left the hospital until she left with me. My son I had him within two hours of arriving at the hospital I was at a 4 cm when I came in they broke my water and I jumped to a 9cm immediately. I didn’t get to have the epidural with him because it was to fast but when I say the easiest birth I mean that it was painful at the end but not like my daughter. Congratulations he’s absolutely beautiful ❤

Congratulations Nicole. We all love you fr. ❤

I stıll remember ur Ponytail video good ol times :)
she slippin
her: experiencing water break also her: *_"BABE DID U PACK IN THE PLAYSTATION???"_*                  *_let me do my hair so i could look ✨presentable✨_*  i love her she's outta the world dude
Cute🥰🥰
I love how you said what you said about your partner, you a real on babes ! ❤ I agree 1000% I didn’t have a partner first pregnancy and with this on I do. I’m so thankful and I can’t wait to meet my first boy too! 💙💙😊
I wished my first birth was this hype, girl you had me rollin 😂 you goofy. Congrats ❤🎉
Ele é tão pequeno e fofo, que gracinha, nem chorou e ficou olhando ao redor 🥺❤️👉👈
Awww congratulations
I made the choice not to be a young mom but videos like these get me so emotional. Getting an extra 10 years of youth with my babu would be such a dream. My mom had me at 28 and my youngest sibling at 35. I plan to have and adopt all my kids between 32-36, and I've loved exploring my 20s on my own, but ahh, I wish there was more time to do both
Watching a gen z give birth to gen b/c, time goes so quickly.
is her real name Michaela? I always thought it was just Kayla
I want to be Nicole when I grow up. Even though I'm older than her
im just watching dis n realizing that me and messiah have the same brthdayyy !!
Is your baby light skin made?
Yes
My mom name micole

12:00 "oh ooo that look like cum" 😂😂
I was crying in awe but at the same time I was laughing at the part she said “Shuttfup”😭😭
might as well name him God
The way she said shut the fuck up😂😂
"For with God, nothing shall be impossible." Luke 1:37
That loud scream shocked. I didn’t expect it 💀💀💀
For the next one,that ring of fire Ur feeling that Ur screaming over,pant through it and store that energy. It's the worst bit of pushing but if u hold back and pant and then do bigger pushes with more oxygen and strength then it puts the energy into that and not screaming. I know it's hard. But I've given birth to 3 with no pain relief and If I'd have known that with my first I don't think I'd have panicked and pushed too soon and tore. Ur baby is beautiful,I know this is a year old and am not sure how u popped up on my page but I'm glad he arrived safe and well and you're all doing ok.
🫣🫣🫣🫣🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
Also congratulations
I'm glad they censored it😭
When she said “we shouldn’t have had sex” my heart stopped beating. What a dose of birth control
hey i love his name ❤❤❤
Girl I thought I was the only woman who's first child ripped them up the front I let out the exact same scream they ain't even stitch me back right first and last student doctor experience
Lol the fact y'all was able to smile and u could dance during labor baby all I felt was pain 🤣
Nicole I completely understand giving birth natural or C-section being in labor and having hell of pain is no joke but it's worth it
Miss ya in these yt streetssss Queen
she’s the first person i’ve seen not cry while their holding their baby
The ‘’shut the fuck up had me dying 😂 congrats 🎉
yall heard her she got cramps in her ahss
Many women handle this like a champ and don’t scream this much, that seemed way over exaggerated.
SHANTE
POV the other people 😮😬
I’m rewatching this like this is so beautiful! I’m only doing this for a man that absolutely deserves it
"Yeahh! I aint... I aint pissin on myself the whole time.. :D"
❤❤❤
Her social medias be so hilarious she's a very entertaining comedian
The lady mad asf😭😭😭

She said “am I peeing on myself?” Oh it’s that WAP! 😂😂😂😂💀
IT WONT GO DOWN SHUT THE F UP LMAO💀
16:43 “it can’t go down shut the f up”😭😂
That’s her decision but I don’t think I would want my baby boy to get circumcised bc it hurts the baby. It’s like torture. They don’t numb the baby at all they just clip away 😢
Aww the is so sweet a new born.
Your baby is adorable! Congratulations on your baby Nicole!!❤️❤️
Omg IS that doctor Bailey?
It's fascinating to look at😂😂😂😂 gurl
Girl the epidural doesn’t feel anywhere as bad as the contractions. And as long as you hold still they won’t fuck your back up.
Ur baby is adorable❤💓

Don show
He’s so adorable l can’t 😭 I’m literally screaming 🥹
Awe you're so sweet and thinking about women doing that all by themselves. I nearly lost my son, my first born baby dad tried to actually cut my baby out of me. I got away and did the whole pregnancy alone, even my family was cruel. Treat me terrible. I appreciate you saying that, you are sorry for all of us that did it all alone. I love this video. You are the cutest girl, young woman, and I love your realness, and authenticity, never stop being you, and congratulations on your second pregnancy. I can't wait to hear your ass tell errybody to "shut the fuc# up!!!" again
February 1st my birthday congratulations Aquarius gang
Are you gonna have a baby right now or not🤰🏼
I do not like this girl. You talk like a ghetto girl. 🤢🤮
Babies ain’t cute but that one is
Oh my god me having head phones in😂😭
U did that, lol been watching u grow for years. Keep it up girl!!
What you shouldn’t watch while pregnant 😂😂😂😂
“You tryna see how thick I am? I weight 136.” KAYLAAA 💀💀✋🏿✋🏿
She said "SHUT THE FUCK UP"🤣🤣
This baby blessed us with a rehabilitated crackhead Nicole
Y’all are so cute 😭😭😭 so happy for baby #2
Literally the „Shut the fuck up“ it’s just her way I love it
They making it worse not even saying her name right 💀
He is so cute!!!
I literally screamed from the moment my contractions started until 6 hours later when they finally gave me my epidural. My pain tolerance is MESSED up and I felt everything heightened by 10 or more times than normal. It was traumatic. You did such a great job girl!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I don't care what you, your mother, ya auntie or ya grandmother say, I'm not doing no natural birth. I didn't even ask to be female 😂
aww her lil poonani. I almost cried hearing her scream. we too young. ugh gen z down! man down !oh god! but the ending was cute wow what a rollercoaster.
She said some shut the f**k up i was crying 😂😂
These videos are my birth control 👁️👄👁️
smh the nurse really said “DON’T POOP” as if she could control it if she wanted to 😂
“it’s that wap 😥” I CANT LMAO
Girl I have the worst break and still got the epidural.
*About to give birth to a child* "I'm trying to look presentable"
That cut from screaming to the baby out doing skin to skin on her chest. I died 😂
she said "SHUT THE FUCK UP ! "
16:50 had me dead af
“Tryna see how thick I am?” “Yea” “I’m 136”  😂😂💀💀💀💀
I’m so happy for you you started seven years ago teaching us how to make a ponytail and now you have a hole family.congratulations for having a baby boy and going thro the hard pain.🎉😁
This baby is cute!
So your telling me that baby have hair when their just birthed
THIS WAS ONLY A YEAR AGO.?? I remember when this was uploaded
all jokes aside, this was actually so wholesome
10:40😂😂 girl bfr
I’ve never actually seen a baby that I thought was cute right out of the womb but messiah (idk if I spelled that right) was a cute lil newborn
Girl I wanted to kiss your angry soft little forehead when you screamed "SHUT THE FUCK UP" why do people think it's okay to straight up just pick on you during birth. Who is "staying in control" during this
Exactly like who are you telling to calm down.
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 beautiful
this is iconic. i can relate to asking my man if he want to bring his game 😂😂😂 like wtf your water just broke and you worried about ur man’s boredom

She said: YOU MEGAN BABY   Me: probably,
i have never seen a newborn baby so alert!! the way he has his eyes opened and how calm it is, and even he almost get himself up wow
Poep
I SWEAR
Omg this was the best labor and delivery vlog I’ve watched. I was laughing and crying. Bruh I fell tf out when she said “shut tf up” I kept rewinding it. Even when She was talking about the absent partner. I cried my eyes out. I’m 8 months and doing everything alone. He just walked away after I found out he has someone else pregnant and she’s due a month after me. The words she spoke had me balling my eyes out. I’m 42 yrs old and this girl had me laughing so damn hard and reflecting on how wrong I was done, but that reassured me imma be ok. Don’t wanna do it without him, but it is what it is. My other children are my support right now. Thank you 🙏🏽 ❤️
16:29 Oh no, now I'm so scared that I don't want to get pregnant...
AWEW
11:57 😭
He was looking at that jacked up hair line, lol!
Who’s here whilst she’s expecting baby numéro deux
never laughed when someone gave birth untill today
I’m rewatching this video and realized how funny and goofy they is during this pregnancy😭..can’t wait to see baby #2 get here 👀
"DONT GET MAH TIDDAEESS"  lmfao that made me laugh 💀
HOLY SHES A MOM?
✨✨✨
The *SHUT THE FUCK UP* is totally me if i ever have kids haha
That kid is gunna be a legend
Usually I hate videos like this because I can't relate to wanting kids, and they always make it seem so awful. They are usually excited to have the child but the experinece seems so scary. Nicole made me see how beautiful giving birth can really be to be honest. I still don't want kids, but this video is amazing!
damn mrs nurse got angry "OKAY SHUT TF UP"
Who is waiting for another labor and delivery
THE SCREAM. 😭😭😭😭😭
Lmfao the end part “ STFU “
Sorry!  There is no Pain Tolerance that compares to “Natural child birth”
Damn 13m views! This lady got paid off this video !
Your a freaking warrior Nikki. Your a beast you did that child birth thing. It’s the toes curling for me.

She went from a bad gurl to Queen mom
“Is that wap” “ Matrix , matrix “ 😂😂🤣 I love her !!!!
1st off... you're amazing! Especially going natural. I didn't make it during my contractions so I got that epidural quick. Lol And I was definitely sure I would have to do this alone since my baby girl's dad is not in the picture but I'm definitely thankful my best friend was right by my side. And we (baby and I) have an amazing support system. So we're blessed.  But anywho... Congrats to all of you mother's and just women in general.  We're Awesome 💪🏾🤰🏾🤱🏾🦸🏾‍♀️👸🏾💖
I love 💗 watching birth vlogs and husbands being their birth panthers for their wives

I’d have told them all to shut the fuck up too. Everyone in yo face like that when you’re hurting is too much. They didn’t need to be talkin to her like that lowkey
They are my Favorite YouTube Couple!  And now Family!!!❤️💜❤️💜
Lmao with sisters second baby she got sent home, then she lost the mucus plug and I was like let’s GO, She Says “Let’s finish this episode of Hoarders “! 🤦🏻‍♀️🤣!  Then bam, hit her like Thunder and it was on!

NOT THE TRIGGER WANRINGBDHWH
I had my baby on the 19th and I could not take them contractions. I tried taking the pain for the longest, I couldn’t take it anymore so I took a epidural. I can’t see how some woman can go without a epidural. That pain is something serious.
No bit have to find out how much it costs you for getting your car
“I feel like I’m doodooing” 🤣 how did that nurse hold her composure
the way she was suffering through contractions but still worried about the drip 💀
She really said shut the fuck up
Nicole going to be a great mother and congratulations girl the baby gorgeous she want people to see that baby come out of her cat 😂 but congrats 🎉
Amazing! Congratulations and enjoy each moment!

Believe that Jesus was crucified for your sins and was raised from the dead, and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sins and You shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost,  "John P Kee " Jesus is real thats a song this is Bumblebee!
The wages of sin is death but the Gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord ACIENT OF DAYS thats a song this is bumblebee I really did let honey bees eat from me
The baby is so cute! And how is he lifting his head like that, that’s crazy!!
Her baby daddy's name is my brothers and her baby's name is mine 🥺💗
Not me getting mad because she should have lift you up a little bit more so you could see the paper if you leaning up for me

baby nicole when age go to be 10 mom you was freak when you give birth
Im scared to have a baby, but i  really want to have one, but first i have to found my soulmate-
Oh my, so, so very adorable!! Congratulations to you both and i hope you're both enjoying parenthood. Enjoy it, because it really doesn't last too long. So many don't enjoy enough, the ride, yet when the kids are all grown up, they look back with great sadness and regret. My 2 Irish friends shared their feelings with me once and i could see, i could feel their regret. Don't allow there to be any regret and do enjoy your new roles. You guys look like beautiful people and show great care and concern for your new born. Best Wishes and take care. :-)
Ertof

I feel bad for laughing at all her jokes while she literally givin birth like how you be that funny while you pushin a human being outta yo cooter like tf. But Nicole I am so proud of you and your partner (sorry idk what his name is) SUCH a cute lil baby! The sounds he makes are so precious!!!
"Malachi I feel liquid, am I peeing on myself" "This that wap, this that wap" 😏🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭
8:33 I watched a documentary on fentanyl  Google captions: I watched a documentary on feminism 😭😭😭
God bless you and your family. I did 26 hours no epidural and still ended up having an ER  c-section. I heard women screaming like that and I was freaked out!!! When I started pushing I thought I was gonna die! I cried!!! I'm happy to see a young couple doing life like this! ♥ 🤗 Continued blessings for you all!

Wow this was amazing!
How can anyone dislike this video. It’s funny and beautiful!!
baby i have had 2 kids and they way you screamed i don't want nomo..
"shut the fu*k up" is the most accurate thing i've heard from someone giving birth....like this is not the time to talk to me...lmao!
That shot of tatted up dad holding the baby, both knocked tf out, just hit different.
“To anybody out there doing it alone, I’m so sorry.”    I gave birth to my son at 19 by myself his dad was not present, she didn’t have to say that but she did. 😢 nothing but love for yur family. 💌💌
I can’t calm down, shut tf up😂😂😂 IM WEAK
Lil man came out hyper and crunk like his mommy 😂 beautiful! 💙
I started laughing when she said “STFU!!” 😭😂😂😂😂
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0wzo_kKM4dbn3iYUW5O2kA
16 minutes in. Is this the Drugs Talking😅🤣😂 'we ain't about to do Dis". Having a Baby is work and nothing to play wit. Something that is never forgotten. The nurse washing the Baby was extremely gentle. The Nurse at Piedmont Fayette was rough. We knew she was doing that on purpose to my Grandson. The Nurse did a great Job with your Son.
Nicole said ohhhhh that look like come🤣🤣🤣
I was laughing hysterical then crying my eyes out. What a beautiful moment. Congratulations
Y'all look just alike 😂❤️
watching this to confirm that i dont want kids :)
Such a supportive husband 🥰and they way u went through the whole experience is great girl 🥺ima be scareddddd

"I wanna see my baby come out my cat...like who don't"                           - Nicole.2021
I watch this every month on my period so I can feel better
*water breaks* Nicole: “you bringing the PlayStation?” “Where my lipgloss?” “Babe, I need to look presentable”     “I wanna see my baby coming out my cat” “what if I pee in myself”😭🤚
when he notice his mom is a crack head
wtf arent u 19
Nic i hope your baby is healthy and safely taken care of and not sexually abused 😭🥳🤩🥺😖😔🥰
Lol when i saw this she say shut the tf  😂
went from doing ponytails to giving birth rq
In most of her other videos shes crazy and weird in the best way possible but this video shows how kind and caring she can be and I love that about her lol😩✋
can yall stop hating and just be happy that she just had a beautiful baby boy congrats nicole
Gurl you stole my hair
Pov : you wish you were the baby
Clearly she didnt take any birthing classes smh.
If you can't handle the pain then get an epidural smh. The screaming doesn't help. It stalls your labor and delivery. Thats why its important to breathe or even make small, controlled noises. Grunting or moaning helps. But not screaming like an idiot. And the cursing is completely uncalled for.
Lmaooo I love you such a beautiful personality beautiful family
I could make a song with the beat of the baby's heartbeat though 😬
Den anybody else see ha ahh🚶🏽‍♀️
Lol at part 10:14 she needed to cover her behind
Ima adopt
Did it hurt when you were pushing
I know I'm late but Watching this I'm just like so happy for you and your family! You deserve every good thing that happens in your life. Stay blessed, Stay YOU!! P.S. I DIIIIIED when you screamed SHUT THE FUCK UP!! Lol I can relate!! Congratulations
You're a trooper Nicole! Babies are evolving. Yah unfortunately we do shite when birthing. Great job girl. Congratulations, lol even if it's a year later. ✌🏽💘🙏🏽👏🏼

omg the baby so cute i wanna cudle it so badly he smiled at the camara omg i am died from this baby
When I gave birth i was having super bad contractions and I went to the hospital like after 11pm and gave birth at 3:35am I walked around because when I arrived I was only 2cm but I walked for like 10 mins and was 6cm they had to break my water for me because I was only 37 weeks but only 3-4 pushes and my baby was out without epidural 🎉 I’m proud of myself (my first pregnancy)
what the fuck did i miss
Her saying she has a high pain tolerance and then screaming like she’s getting brutally murdered scares the shit out of me to even think about giving birth😭
The scream I was like No no 😭 but then when I saw the baby I was smiling like a titan😭❤️❤️❤️
I aint ever getting pregnant😒✋🏾 U okay Bestie? :<
Arent you the girl trying to make her hair ponytail 😨😨
16:43
I have a 7 month old, that moment was the best and most painful moment of my life, I was induced, my boy started trying to sit at 2 n half ... I just want to tell you to enjoy every moment while you can ❤️ these babies grow up so fast❤️
Awe who still watching this after he was born  MEE 😁

That was my hole energy when I had my son😂😂😂❤️💙💙💙❤️when she screamed I don’t wanna have a baby anymore😂😭so relatable I literally was wishing I’d never slept with my partner and in those 15 mins of pushing I hated him so much all I could focus on was the midwifes lanyard to get some aspect of control back. Worth it in the end tho my little booboo is 6months now and thriving 💙💙I’m late but congrats momma xxxx

You can tell you both really enjoy each other’s company 😩❤️ god bless you and yours!!

My mouth was wide open when the intro said "First Bath". In the UK, they don't wash their babies like that until a couple days after. A full baby bath, won't happen for a least a week or two after giving birth. I asked for a bath bath the next day and they all looked at me like I'm crazy. But I'm Jamaican, we don't roll like that. Leaving that mess in the babies hair for weeks, isn't the way we do things back home. Congratulations Kayla, you did good 💓
who were you telling to shut the #### up
I think my nurse would have rather me telling her to stfu instead of me squeezing tf out of her hand
He's cry is so precious and he's handsome
Izz datt WAP Izzz dat WAPP 🥴🤣
The baby is so cute.. 🥺🥺😍😍😘😘 Love from India..
Omg her do perfectttttttt!!!! I’m so happy for you both
It looks so hard giving birth with a mask
That outfit when you almost are going it to labour whit Gucci bag and sh (•_•)
She supposed to squat, ts ain’t how they supposed to do it
I screamed the exact same way when I had one of mine without the epidural! Lol I’m glad I wasn’t the only one, all the nurses were yelling at me not to scream, like I’m pushing what felt like a whole cantaloupe out of my body & you don’t want me to scream? 🤨
why screamig
dude the sounds the baby makes is so adorable i cant
I'm proud of you and don't even know you.  Good job  🧡❤
You know you getting old when Nicole TV has a child
"this is the longest I've kept a wig on. aH" "babe we gotta go." "I don't give a f"
How long did it take (the birthing)
Is these the drugs talking? We ain’t bout to do this.🤣🤣
Maa shaa Allah  baby so cute

Giving birth is scary
What’s the generation after gen z?

Kayla you really won with Malachi, I see how he cares for you and accepts you for you that’s a real man in love❤️
and get back on that______ 😂😂😂
LMFAOOOO it’s the stfu for me
Y'all precious
1. My first birth- water broke at 2pm, no contractions until I hit 3cm around 430pm, received epidural around 9pm and Pitocin at 12am, gave birth 830 the next morning 2. Second birth-fell asleep while in labor but I didn’t know. I was just nauseous as hell. Woke up the next day already 5cm with 6 min contractions. Went in at 1030, one failed epidural gave birth at 1 in the afternoon.
❤️❤️❤️
the funny part was SHUT THE fuk up
It’s that wap🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Is this what this world has come to for online celebrities and influencers!?🤦🏻‍♂️ Sharing their delivery video? Sharing their baby's first glimpse, something that private with the entire world? Where does the sharing every tiny bit of their lives with the whole wide world stop??🤷🏻‍♂️ Imagine gen Z's kids growing up realising how their entire lives right from the momrnt they come out of their mother's womb is out there online for the world to look, analyse and criticize at down the line.🤷🏻‍♂️
i love you Nicole your baby is so cute i would like o see what he become in life

we all know you have a sore throat after those screams you just pulled
Wow his baby is so cute😍😍
i can give you some tips when you have a baby boy  one when the are almost gonna turn 1 do not give choclate  cuz then they will get hungry at night and half of the time refuse to drink there milk and second be carefull with what you give them they can be alergic my sister has a baby boy a wonderfull kid with fantasy and being fast he can already set a few steps  he is not even 1 year old i hope you will have  a very calm and peacefull life with your baby boy  edit but you can choose if you want to give choclate or not it not my choice its yours

Thank you for sharing this. I watch this video everytime I think about having a child n wanting to see the positive side. Thank you.
"Ahhhhhh I can't calm down shut the f up!!!!!"🤣it's not even funny idk why I'm laughing
Your Husband "baby I love you "  You "AHHHHHH SHUT THE FUCK UUUPPPP". just kidding of course,I think your baby is beautiful 😍😍😍
' i gotta do my hairrrr. lmaoo'
It’s been 2 months ALREADYY
She gave birth NO EPIDURAL LIKE WHATTTTT
I love how her man tryin to Comfort her when pushing and she just screamed SHUT THE FUCK UP
I am so darn sensitive that even though I know she’s was in pain, and that people have probably done worse, I still wanted to cry for whoever she told to stfu 😅 like in that situation I would’ve taken it so personally and cried in that moment. Come for me I deserve it 😭😭🤦🏽‍♀️
brooo, remember when she was doing the ponytail tutorial and now shes giving birth
I stopped dating black guys years ago. Seems like all they do is get you pregnant and leave. I'd rather be with white men
well that was traumatizing🥲 but he is beautiful❤️
Wow
I loved everything about this video. Thank you for sharing this precious moment in your life 💜
مبروك
الحمدالله عليه سلامه😍يترب في عزكم
i still cant beleve my fav  youtuber is a mommy
I love this entire video 🥺🥺🥺
Drs recommend that a mother trim her finger nails SO AS NOT TO PINCH OR SCRATCH NEW BABY. Congratulations btw. Those fake nails should pop right of soeaked in hot water.
I pray that your family will grow strong and a great life will be with you guys
You did a Awesome job!  I literally cried watching this!  I’m a mother of 4, yes it is very hard to go through the whole process!  Those 9 long months that feel like years 😂 but I did it all 4 times in the delivery room alone! It was hard; but yes It takes TWO. Congrats love 💕 Welcome to motherhood 💜
She said shut tf UP💜💜💜😭😭😭😂😂
Seeing them together shows me that is possible for people our age to be committed
Omg i really cry when u scream very loud to push out the baby congratulation for u sweety u will be sweet and very funy mom 🥰😘
When she said it's fascinating to look at😂😂😏😏🤐😪
Awww  so cute 😊😙
The baby is so cute 😭😍✋

JAJAJAJAAJJA 6:39  Nicole: *pujaba* Nicole: *revisaba su cuenta de tik tok*
Allah bağışlasın çok tatlı maşallah ☺️☺️
Uhhm why did you name him messiah by the way
14:07- 15:54 ❤️🥺✨
I’m 6 weeks right now I’m scared asf
If I'm not like nicole when I grow up I don't wanna grow up
It all started with the ponytail
Damn when I was going into labour my cervix wasn't even one centimetre but by the time I was 3 cm I had the epidural and girl I know how you feel about needles that's how I felt but I couldn't take the pain anymore I was in labour for 72 hours with my baby girl that is now 2 months old
Your skin is so sweet 😿💜💜💜✨
Congrats gal
Y is she soo calm and acting soo wired 🥺😔like there no pain
LMFAOOO she told them to stfu hdbch3eyfbv3yo
If you laughed ur going to hell-
This is real stupid because she's not calling him Jesus r God so I don't see what the problem is.... the definition behind Messiah is...The promise deliverer of the Jewish Nation prophesied in the Hebrew Nation / a leader or a savior of a particular group or cause....Yes they called Jesus a deliverer and a savior of all mankind.... Let me repeat that (JESUS) IS A DELIVERER AND A SAVIOR OF (ALL MANKIND) not a particular group or calls (all mankind) remember that... So with that being said they only called (JESUS) Messiah to try to describe who he is because of the meaning of Messiah but Messiah is not one of the true names that they called (JESUS).... There are at least 16 true different names they call (JESUS) and you can look it up and Messiah is not one of them they only mentioned Messiah when they're trying to describe him not as one of his names.... So please stop downing people for using the name Messiah to name their kids because that is not one of the true name of (JESUS CHRIST)... get your information right before you start throwing stones... anyway you shouldn't even be doing that either!!!!!
*water broke* Nicole- “you gon bring the PlayStation?”
Omg i was all in that process last month i felt pain so bad till i was confused omg bt wen my bby com out wen i see him i was like it worth the pain to bring such a wonderful bby😗😍😍😍😗😗😍 to all the mothers out their am proud of you all because its nt something nice to in unbearable pain just to bring a baby

“ I CAN’T CALM DOWN STFU”                                 -Nicole 2021
It can't go down shut the f*to up
Even though I'm a little late congratulations he is gorgeous he's so strong he was already using his arms to lift his neck and his head to move his head he's strong already look at him he's a cutie pie ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I literally cried happy tears when I seen him.precious
0:57 XDDDD omgoosssh
I was cracking up when it showed her screaming stfu, then a few seconds later cuts to all the nurses being quiet 🤣
That baby opened his eyes so fast
19:40 he already look like em😭
woman have such a high pain tolerance, i know i would never want to do that nor would i be able to tolerate that type of pain. I stub my toe and want to cry. WOMEN ARE ELITE.   EDIT- Another thing i would like to add is women could also have complications from giving birth so that's another thing they have to think about while also growing a baby.
Exactly daddy's twin..he look so much like his dad...so cute. God Bless every mom & mom to be.  Congratulations Latest mom🤰🤱...you did great 💪❤❤🌹🌹
Hahahahahaha I loved the way u yelled. That seemed extremely painful. Bless up!!!
Congratulations beautiful mom

When you screamed like that I was nope I don’t wanna go natural anymore, that scream scared me

I had to rewatch this vid loll Kayla: is these the drugs talkin Me: 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
like yesterday you were making a pony tale tutorial and now you have a baby
THE "STFU" LMAOOAAOOA
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates✌️
Are you kidding me??? Nicole, your baby laughed!!! Aaawwwwn...he used to your loud laughters hahahaha
Oh my, this woman is legit funny🤣🤣😅🙏🏾❤
😍😍😍🤗
Her scream tho I was in tears🤣🤣
يارب ارزقني بي طفل سليم انك عل كل شي قدير اللهم صل وسلم على سيدنا محمد وعلى آله وصحبه أجمعين
I can't calm down, stfu😀😀😀😀
Can we talk about what she says at 14:07-15:54? I've been scrolling through the comments section but no one's brought it up. So much wisdom dropped there. She is so respectful and thoughtful and loving of her husband and unborn child. I agree that people don't talk about it that much, about men needing support from their partners, too. So her bringing it up, while she's in labor, you know she's telling the truth. I'm glad they support each other. And that the baby is wanted and prayed for. 💓
Idk why I’m crying baby is cute 🥰 you made me want one for a second
Bruh. Your baby really be tryna lift his head up to have a conversation with you he's not even a couple minutes old. :-/ :-/
Кто же тебя с такими ногтями в родзал пустил???
Awwww, what a cute little baby💗
Those are good drugs to be talking such wisdom
Please cut your nails its really dangerous to baby
Owww so cute 🥺😍
When she was screaming I could feel that omg no it's painful 🙂
I can’t wait to have mine 🙏🏽❤️
This girl play too damn much 😂😂😂😂😂😂
the way she was screaming just made me cry idek if I want to have kids anymore😭 (thank you for the warning I had to stop I nearly had an anxiety attack)
I love this video...y’all are the cutest☺️🥰🙏🏽
So I’ve had two girls, 1st with an epidural and the 2nd a natural water birth. I’m due in November and I’m definitely going for another water birth but they also said I couldn’t record, how did you hide your phone?
she took it so well
Oml it sounds so painful Congrats sis I know I'm late but he looks so cute I bet your a good mom.   Now that I know when I am older and have kids I ain't pushing imma have a Caesarean
15:57 is where she starts giving birth your welcome :)
😢😢😊😁 Congratulations!
Nicole where is your mother ? She should’ve been there with you !
LMAOOOO THE “STFU”
That’s the cutest baby I have EVER seen
THE WAY SHES MAKING JOKES WHILE IN LABOUR HAS ME ROLLINGGF
imagine the baby watching this when he grows up
not me tearing up when she held the baby for the first time. not me tearing up AGAIN when your husband was cradling the baby while they slept. this whole video was beautiful
Ok, I was scared after your screams, I mean, I'm thinking about beautiful things but I imagine that all that goes to shit because you can't focus on beautiful things.
Bring the playstation 😂😂😂
This video made me so emotional. SO HAPPY FOR YOU!
1:58 wtf did he just say?
his age ??
What is a boy or girl
He's really gorgeous congratulations :-)
Malachi(I’m not sure of the spelling) is so helpful and has been this whole pregnancy. Y’all make me happy 🥺.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 she hella funny
you've grown so muchhhh omgg i cantt believe ur now a mom!
Very noisy
I wonder how much fentanyl they can give a woman in labor. Because people overdose over small doses so obviously they are monitoring and controlling the amount they give u.
Fentanyl though ?? Whaaaat that can't effect the baby ? Thats so interesting im super curious
Damnnnn girl u still able to buss it while in the middle of contractions !!! U GO QUEEEEN woman are fkn super heros
I fknnn sweat u girlll 😘😘🔥🔥🔥 U GONNA BE AN AMAZING MOM
Wait!!  did u scramed loudly coz of pain or u were scared??
The joy you had on your face when Messiah was tryna look at you..aww
Brooo the scream takes me tf out ✋🏾
I love how humble and wise you are. You are so mature and you’ll make a great mother and your husband will make a great father. This is how I want my life to be when I have a kid.
damn i thought yall were just simping when u said her baby was cute straight outta the womb but then i see him & im like oMGOSH THAT BOY IS  C U T E ! congratulations nicole!
"Shut the fuck up" 😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭
"Is these the drugs talking"😂😂
So cute 🥰
Late to watching this but congrats... while it may have been the drugs making you talk, you were on point. I love that you have a partner that’s just as happy as you are about becoming parents. How much he cares about you and y’all’s son is so very evident. He’s an absolutely beautiful baby boy! Congrats again to the both of you!!
Wow. You are so special 😘💖 Nicole. A big heart of gold! Thank you for sharing your special moment with US ❤️💕 ALL. Truly appreciate it. Keep That happiness 😉 and when Times get rough, Remember THESE moments together. You Guys are Incredible 💘.
This is beautiful ❤️❤️❤️
Welcome to world messiah:))
I don’t know why I’m proud
Baby is so cute 😍🥰😘😘
He's super beautiful!!!! It's amazing he's already that capable of lifting his head up to look up a momma like that. Do a lot of babies do that? I just never seen that before. Mommy and baby are so pretty! Daddy and baby look super beautiful together too, and I love dad's dreads. Congrats guys!
Beautiful, Just Beautiful  🦋
She said way longer than a week hahahahaha I’m dying
She said Shut the fuck up 😂😂😂😂😂awww❤️
you did fantastic, mama!! congratulations!!
So... yes! I cried! My mouth dropped when you screamed stfu! You two are genuine and half & half that became whole. I love it. Thank you for this night cap.
she put a whole outfit together just to give birth..wow!! id be way to panicked and overthinking
why he's white
His eyes are very ooen
She gonna say is it the drugs talking im cdfuuu 😂😂
It’s that WAP it’s that WAP it’s not the WAP it’s that drop “.  😂😂😂😂
The only thing you have is asthma “. Yeah well a baby too “. 😂
There's 1 round and-   And?!... There's more?😭
this was so beautiful
HOW THAT BABY WAS BORN THIS PRETTY? LOOOK AT THAT FACE DAMN the boy is already a grown man I almost can see his mustache hello? You didn't give birth girl u painted a beautiful boy I'm honestly shocked
she was in labor and is still a natural comedian- this girl is a queen
when u we’re screaming i’m so sorry i died 😭😭🧍🏻‍♀️💀
My husband tried to tell me to be calm and breathe....i almost shot him. You can't tell a woman in labour to calm down 😂😂😂😂
I come back here as a reminder to take birth control 😀
Congratulations on your new bundle of joy. He's beautiful 💙
Omg!!!! The baby's so cute🥺 Can I kidnap him/her?
-Nicole looking amazing when going into labor-  -my mom in sweats and tank top-
You did amazing! I'm having my 7th child soon. Just don't let them make you stay on your back. The risk of tearing is less in an upright position.
SHUT TF UP LMFAOAOOAOAOOAOA
Congrats Nicole!! I love you!!
11:26 WaKiNg Up In tHe mOrNiNg
The way she screamed I don’t wanna have a baby anymore 😭😭😭
THERES ONLY ONE MESSIAH his name is JESUS CHRIST DONT YOU EVER BLASPHEME THE LIVING GOD
"dripping back to back" 😂😂😂Your sense of humor is the one
Omg I'm so scared especially the last part....but it also useful to know how it works.... It's really terrifying to hear her scream from pain...
Im late cause i was scared to watch it but this just made me so happy
This was amazing to witness!! Had me in tears they way Messiah was looking at you. Thank you for sharing and congratulations to you both.
Dammmmn we’re so happy for you girl you came the looooongest way
Can someone put down the minute where she said "stfu"?
Baby boy came out ready to see the world! soooo awesome!
Congrats mommy & daddy! Sleep when baby sleeps & don't worry about advice anyone tries to give, your intuition will steer you right!   I want a boy soooo bad but have 3 girls and had a tubal done.. regret the tubal but it is what it is.
that’s actually a really cute baby. babies are always ugly to me
💔🙄

You know what’s funny the baby’s is white when new born but he will get his skin tone when he grows as when me and my sibling were new borns we were very very dark and grew up to have lighter skin tones
*Nicole screams* *turns on caption* Caption: [Music] [Applause]

Dude, you earned my sub. I'm not even sure how you wound up in my feed, but I've watched several videos of you being you, and I have to say, you are one of the MOST interesting people I have ever come across in my life! You have a natural gift of comedy and it makes you AWESOME!   Congrats to you and your husband for the gift of a new life, and congrats to YOU for really killing it with your unique style of entertainment. I've laughed until it literally hurt because of you! Well done!  It is an honor to make your acquaintance, madam. Bless up.

When I hear that other pregnant women at full term water break on its own I get so jealous. I was in full blown spontaneous labor at a full 10 and they still had to break my water bag! Congrats girl! You did it momma 💖💖
You’re so strong Nicole omd!
THIS IS SO CUTE
He's handsome ❤️♥️🙏
Why was she screaming so much? Pushing is the easiest part. You're completely out of pain once it's time for that, pushing is relief.
Me and messiah have the same birthday  I feel honored
You did well sis.
When she said STFU i died LMAOOOO BYE
i didn’t even know she was pregnant 😩
👏👏👏👏💖💔
lmaooo this is the funniest labor delivery video EVER LMAOAOAO
congrats baby!!!!
I can't believe she was really cursing out the nurses. They were helping her not the other way around. If it hurt THAT BAD, u should have kept ur legs closed.
even pregnant she got an hourglass body
BRUH????
Nicole:”I feel liquid...am I abt to pee on myself...”her six seconds later:”naw it’s dat wap it’s dat wap😤”I CANT WITH THIS WOMAN😑🔫
Gosh she is beautiful
I’m jealous that your first poop felt amazing because they must have not gave me enough stool softener because if I did not shit out a wall of shit it wasn’t even round it was flat thick ass boulders. Legit cylinders
Do you go to shore with those finger nail?
CONGRATULATIONS NICOLE 💙💙💙💙✨ bless your beautiful family!
God is truly amazing. Congratulations to the new mommy and daddy ❤️

The baby wasn't even crying he was laughing it's the most beautiful thing ever I'm very proud of our gurl!
They seem very happy 💖 Congratulations to them.
Don't ever sleep with your baby on your side or stomach. It's so easy to unintentionally roll over on them and they fall off the bed or suffocate.
She's poking those nails into his skin 😡
I love it how you really screamed "STFU" to the nurses😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣
lol mah girl kayla u gd yes you be like shut the fuck up and den after u be cool lol

DIOS BENDIGA TU VIDA Y LA DE TU BEBÉ. Es hermosisimo tu bebé felicidades.❤
Yoooo 🤣🤣 I replayed STFU 8 times !! Bc I remember that moment with my first😂😂 I dead ass snapped at the nurse cuz she tighten that band around my stomach to monitor contractions which only applied more pressure! Me: TAKE IT TF OFF NEOW!!!  I apologized later, she said I’m use to it.  I also pooped during delivery, but I was hella constipated that whole pregnancy. He’s beautiful and you did an amazing job Nicole. Blessings 🥰
Awww baby boy so adoreable
Congratulations sweetheart, this was beautiful 😍❤
“Poo felt amazing, I loved it, I needed that” 😂😂
how  old are ya?
I don't want kids after watching this 😂😂😂 she said STFU!!!🤬
I’m sorry but I had to laugh when you said “stfu” I felt the same damn way when I was in labor
I just love the fact that she still has her energy and vibe even while about to give birth ❤
congrats
Ik they was done when you said stfu lol but I understand especially first time and it’s a lot going on at once with so many people talking it gets frustrating
Why would they tell her to shut the f*** up when she's giving birth
Until now, I can understand that it will not be in the video 😮😫😫😫...  ...
Congratulation he's adorable 💗💖
When she said shut the fuck up 🤣🤣🤣🤣 that's gonna be me in July 🥴
Baby came out with a full head of hair
U were pregnant?!
What happened to you making YouTube videos😳
please dont promote clips that have people saying the Lord's name in vain and get right with God you can just censor it when people say the Lord's name in vain  artists like carti sell their soul  and do satanic rituals to people who listen to his music be safe when listening to him please get right with God, God bless
Imagine the kid watching this video after growing up
Ahhhhh this making me so scared to have a baby but excited too. The baby is so adorable 🥰

Congratulations
Wow us women are so strong. Thank you for sharing this with us, this was beautiful ♥️ I’ve gave birth natural with epidural. It was my first time ( I only have one kid ). I applaud u for being brave and strong to not get one.  Women’s body are made to give birth. And I showed us the real deal.  Thank u again for that. I almost didn’t get one but towards the end I could not take the pain and they said last chance to me. So I said ok because it was my first time and had no idea what to expect and what was happening. And ur right the recovery process is faster the way u did it. I couldn’t walk or feel my legs for a day in a half and it was pretty scary.  So congratulations on your beautiful baby boy! ♥️♥️♥️♥️
He’s so handsome!!
Who is that woman that kept telling you to stay in control??? How are you gone stay in control with no epidural??? You felt all that I heard them screams. I wouldn’t be telling no one giving birth to. Calm down, or stay in control.
“I CANT CALM DOWN SHUT TF UP” 🥴😂😂😂
Acá viendo como la chica de la cola volviéndose una hermosa y buena madre- WOA LLORAR 😭👊
What a wonderful blessing!! Cute self!

Aww we share birthdays 🎂 ❤
I've never seen such a upbeat pregnant woman who moved as swifty as she did ahah. I want to be like this when I'm pregnant ahah just laughing, having fun, having a partner who's chill and I like how he also was upbeat which I feel helped you be at ease especially near the time of you giving birth. You know, I want all that and more and then hopefully that baby slip right outta me when the times due😂 + I want a black nurse for when I have a child! The way she ensured that she was comfortable and well instead of dismissing her that I see so much with black & poc when they have a child. Also I'm having a about to give birth outfit also purr😌  A beautiful baby boy! And a gorgeous family overall. The best I wish for you all  Tataa, Take Care.    Muaah Much love -<3

I just cried real tears watching this. I know I'm late but you did such an amazing job. Congratulations you guys 💞💞💞
The shhut the fuck up bit.. I woke my own kids up with laughing... Girl you got this x
I thought u were 12
He’s already a happy baby 💙💙 so alert !!
Girl, I am going say this from an asexual point of view, Good men and women don't fall out of tree's you either let god drive you to them or you go and find them yourself( I hope that was not offensive for the people who don't believe in god). The point is, you found yourself a wonderful man and I am so happy for you. I subscribe to you not because you kid of make me laugh a little but I do that because you show me to just be myself. I don't now if that is what you were portraying when you created this YouTube channel, but I admired and still do admire the way you act like a little goofball(respectfully) on camera. I have to be honest but sometime ago I saw someone who was hating on you in a video and I laughed. I didn't even think that even if you didn't hear me, it hurt even if you didn't know that I laughed. What I am trying say is please don't let the idiot who hates you get to you. I beg of you! I want you to stay happy and successful and I want to welcome Messiah in the fam! He is beautiful and so is your family and your heart! Don't change for anything, and Nicole.... Do you mind reading this comment in one of your upcoming video's? I would appreciate it a ton, I love you and congratulations to your new family!!!!🤗
0:58 LOL
Hope ur baby has a wonderful life <3333
first was the hair tutorial.  Now she's a mother and different
❤️❤️❤️🙏🏽
She is so brave..
If you look at her first video its about someones new baby (And the baby is ugly) and look at her now. Has a child and a husband. Im so happy for you nicole. Its good you made it this far
Omg Im so happy for you <3
This video made me pregnant
I know I’m late, but I love the way she cherishes her husband! Absolutely beautiful. Congratulations to you and yours!

Routine Infant circumcision is a violation of human rights and mutilation. No medical organization recommends it anymore. It is purely cosmetic. You are essentially removing the male GSpot.
First u remove ur nails
He's so cute
💪💪💪💪💪 u strong!!!!
NURSES ARE TRAINED . Pain is PAIN. . THEY HEAR WORSE. An YALL need to stfu
Y’all remember “move like a snake” well now it “moves like a motha” 👏👏👏
I just kept DYING LAUGHING WHEN SHE SAID STFU
I’m scared to go through this 😭🥺
I aint having no kids no more😥
"And get back on that" .....
happy days with you. 😊your baby is very sweet.💕🌼
Hi
Nicole is sooooo pretty! fearfully and wonderfully made by God
can we please talk about how wise she is even in the middle of the night? i could nevah
When she said "I'm trying to look presentable" and she was literally on her way to give birth. Dead 😂
Best video ever
The baby looks exactly like his daddies newborn photos omg his twin 100%
I was laughing so hard when she yelled "STFUUUUUUU" no offense, and congrats girl. you passed the first stage of being a mom, god speed and lysm! ❤❤❤

https://youtube.com/channel/UCzrwQCLgjiyciesVJg6QIEQ
Mama Nicole be like: STUF!!
She giving birth and doing the bust oou girl yo baby go be the next Nicole
I am in tears! He was smiling!!!😭 BRO WHAT!? I give you props pushing him out in only 5min! That’s painful! Since I was calm, and took it slow. I had 20 min (no meds at all) to push my daughter out and I only had a graze. They were putting a numbing cream on me the whole time which helped. A little more and I would’ve torn.
yea....im not having kids
Beautiful precious gift from above by the way GodBless you all 💙🙏🏾
Lesson learned: never calm your wife down while giving birth because us men won’t understand Lol....it’ll be cool if KaylaNicole blessed Deshae to be The Godfather
Finally the truth....Screaming is the best part but no matter what the pain is really, real. Worth it!🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 many blessings ✊🏾
IM DEAD 💀 SHE IS SO FUNNY 😂 BUT CONGRATULATIONS 🎉🎊🎈

Everyone talking about her scream Me thinking I should click off
Nicole girlllll where the videos
You gotta wear a MASK while giving BIRTH!?!?!?! Bruh. The amount of breathing you need to do. The doctors should at least wear more masks for the pregnancy procedures because you would be in alot of pain while trynna breathe huge breaths like that
Congratulations on your bundle of joy, mama!!! 💕❤️

Shut the f up 😂
Her baby is so frickin handsome
Congrats sweetie!!❤️🎉😍😁
I did it natural with my daughter who was born jan. 3rd 2021 and omg I can't again. Lol! Right when it was time to push her out i told them I need the epidural.  They were like " its too late time to push" . I have 2 kids now and my favorite part of it all is the labor. If I could skip the whole pregnancy and go straight to labor I'd be fine. Lol!
Don’t feel bad about tellin ya man to stfu, I told the nurse the same thing. I went natural with my daughter, I did get an epidural in the beginning but after 4 hours it wore off. I wouldn’t dilate so they gave me pitocin and her heartbeat dropped. So 6 hrs without meds and pitocin, was the worse! The nurse told me to stop screaming and I asked if she kids, she told me no. I started screaming again!! He’s beautiful Nicole, congratulations
1:53 LMAO
Awwww the baby so cute 😁😁😁😁 congrats 🥳🥳
19:40 awww 🥰 dad and baby so cute ☺️
Please no bad comments, I HOPE YOU GUYS ENJOY THE REST OF YOUR LIVES WITH THIS BUNDLE OF JOY❤💥

no, she didn't say "I can't go down STFU" I'm crying But he is very beautiful congratulations
She's like a child 😂😂 Oh and congrats
Who ain't gonna capture this moment tf😂😂😂
Beautiful Strong lil King👑💙🙏🏽Naturally, women supposed to squat when giving birth, as gravity helps bring baby down. But these backwards med teachings, has got women giving birth in the most dangerous way, on their backs, which is more risky. As there is added pressure on the spine and internal organs. Squatting when giving birth will reduce the pressure massively causing less pain. Women please, don't let these doctors nurses have you on your backs when giving birth.🙏🏽
I've never watched a vid of a couple and felt instantly, the love and abundance they have. King and Queen
she said shut the f*** up

OMG...kudos to you... I couldn't labour for a a minute....I went in for a scheduled c-section because I'm so tiny and the baby had no where to come through... I think it would be my ass as well cause.... this baby was over 7lbs... I'm not playing with his big ass.... when they are big...you just want to smack them because of what they did to your body... can you imagine how much smacking for natural birth... Lawd Jesus!🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🙈🙈😭
Im mad bc my kids didn't tell me you had a baby!!!! I wish nothing but abundance of blessings on your family and im so happy for you!!! I cried like i was in the room! ❤💓🙌🏾🙏🏾

Hi Nicole, if you read this and also if you're not allergic...red raspberry leaf by Nature's Way will help the womb and vagina snap back quicker 100 vegetarian capsules 450 mg...preferably with meals and starting with one capsule until or unless you need or can handle more. Safe while breastfeeding and can increase milk supply.
You WON 🏆 SIS !!!!!! CONGRATULATIONS.

Omggggggggg
Hello beautifuls you were all created wonderfully beautifully and fearfully made by the Almighty God alleluia. Psalm 139:14 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.  You are so loved by the almighty king that he sent his only begotten Son so that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life. (John 3:16) Jesus died on the cross paying for our sins. He took the hell price we all deserve even jus for having one bad thought. So this is how we are saved: God sent his Son (Jesus) to die on the cross and to rise again the 3rd day taking our sins for us. Romans 10:9 says That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. •we Repent which means unbelief to Belief of the sacrifice of Jesus. And to turn away from all our sins and follow Jesus which is holiness, righteousness no sin. So repentance is a change of mind and action ^. Our works don’t save us we cannot buy heaven with our good works! (Isaiah 64:6), (Ephesians 2.8-10) pls search an read them :) but Jesus already paid the price so we have to accept his FREE gift he’s offering u and the way u do that is by simply trusting putting ur full faith in the blood of Jesus that cleanses us from all sins making us white as snow. And you repent from sin and turn away from sin! And you will then by the Holy Ghost start to change and produce the fruits of the spirit (Galatians 5:22-23) and you will flee from (Galatians 5:19-21) pls search n read :) God bless you all and I hope and pray u will accept the FREE gift of God and turn away from sin so that i may see you in heaven shalom🤍
This just reminded me how ghetto labor and delivery is. 😩😩😩. It hurts so bad. 😂 But I love my son so much! And I only carried him for 29 weeks 😩! Congratulations ❤️❤️❤️

Okay Kayla With The Supportive Word...
"Do you know your megan baby?"  ** aggressively points at stomach  "I know your Megan's baby, big fat ahh..."
The deeper the root the stronger the tree! Some trees provide healing, some shade, some fruit, and some beauty and no matter what kind of storm comes its way it stands  because it's rooted deep. Get rooted in Christ, so you can be like one of those trees! You can bring beauty to an ugly situation, healing to the broken, shade to those who are in a heated place, and the Fruit of peace to those that are in a storm.
Pushed Malachi right out
Take good care of ur baby

Hi Nicole Tv I noticed that you use auto-generated captions on your videos. Unfortunately, auto-generated captions contain tons of mistakes that make it harder for the 360 million folks globally who rely on closed captions to understand your videos! For example, when you are in the bathroom getting ready and y'all are talking about the PlayStation your husband said "I don't want to bring this" but the caption said, "I'm going to write this." Mistakes like this make it harder for people with hearing impairments to fully enjoy your videos. I know I really enjoy seeing the content you make and want other people to be able to enjoy it too. It’s really easy to add your own captions to videos either through Youtube or through other platforms, like CADET and Amara. I hope you take this into consideration and make your videos more accessible!
Awwww thank you so much for sharing your journey 🥺😍😍😍
ma’am. I STOP WATCHING YOUR CHANNEL FOR 7 MONTHS AND I COME BACK TO SEE YOU AS A MOM? b i t c h. im so happy for you💖😙 and your bf (idk if he’s ur hubby).

No matter how much you try and savor every second of him from first holding him, to every other first that comes after, the time will feel like it flew by. You'll look at this video months from now and he wont look the same and you'll wonder how you didn't notice the changes in his face everyday. All the new noises and faces he'll make. Watching his personality form. Staying up all night just to look at him. Always, Always thinking and doing for him. Being a mom is the most beautiful and bittersweet thing💖. Congratulations to you guys on baby Messiah💙

Hi! Just here to let you know or to remind you that Jesus saves! We all are sinners and we all fall short of God’s grace, but God’s love was greater than that and He sent His one and only Son to be the ultimate sacrifice that saves us all! He’s remained faithful through all the ages and generations of our sin, rebellion, and us turning away from Him. God loved us so much that He hasn’t given up on us and is still working in our lives! He woke you up this morning, that’s not by chance but by purpose. Jesus will come one day to destroy and defeat evil once and for all, and you don’t want to be condemned for your sins because of your refusal of repentance. So while you still have a chance, please repent of your sins and turn to God! He will accept you just as you are and change you around. Jesus is willing to set you free from sin, depression, lust, anxiety, illness, and so much more. Jesus wants a relationship with you and He wants you to dwell in His Kingdom. Remember, Jesus saves!!!
I know im late but Congratulations 🥰🥰🥰🥰 he so cuteeeeee!!!! And bye.

The baby came in and atmosphere of joy, and love! Ladies, when you're carrying a baby be as happy as Nicole. Don't let a mfing soul upset y'all even a little bit! Being sad while carrying a baby,will make the child feel rejected. Nope, let that baby experience alllllll joy while I'm the womb.
It's so cute and big
I could never and I won't ever. But congrats tho <3

sono stato infettato da HPV (Papillomavirus umano) nel 2017 e da allora sono stato alla ricerca di una cura.  Nel novembre dello scorso anno, quando quasi mi arrendevo, sono entrato in contatto con un post su Internet in cui ho copiato l'email di un erborista guaritore di nome Dr Sambi che fornisce una soluzione erboristica alle malattie.  L'ho contattato e ho raggiunto un accordo con lui e mi ha inviato un rimedio a base di erbe attraverso il servizio pacchi unito insieme a istruzioni su come usarlo.  Con mia grande sorpresa, sono guarito dopo 21 giorni di utilizzo del rimedio come assicurato dall'erborista.   Ho deciso di condividerlo perché so che ci sono molte persone là fuori che hanno bisogno di tale aiuto.  contattare l'erborista su via  E-mail: drsambisolutionhome@gmail.com  Or WhatsApp su +2348116943694 unisciti al suo gruppo tramite: https://chat.whatsapp.com/L5Jp1keY5c7HvVlvgbzkXs   Cura tante malattie come: -   *La malattia di Meniere   * Emicrania   *Spasmi muscolari   *Fibrosi cistica   *Distrofia muscolare   *Diabetes   *Il cancro del pancreas   *Demenza   *Freddo Comune   *Epilessia   * Cancro al sangue   * HPV   * ALS   * Herpes e molto altro ancora..

i didn't skip not one minute. that was beautiful, thank you for letting us into your labor experience
Let me drop a secret real quick you don't actually have to push your body will do it all and actually when you do push it's being counterproductive and is going against your body I pushed through my son and I tore and I had to get several stitches once I found out that I didn't have to push both of my daughters were born without pushing no tearing and it went faster
Lmfao I weigh 136 😭😭😭🤣🤣 girl bye
congrats on the baby!💕✨ hes beautiful
I laughed through the whole vid when I watched it last two weeks ago. I know its painful but the way you were acting before cracked me up and when you told him to stfu I  wheezed😂

So beautiful 😍 women are so amazing I can’t imagine the pain you were in but you’re a trooper! Congrats on such a beautiful little boy ❤️
1:58 Got excited when my contractions started on a Saturday and then I didn’t have my baby until Thursday 😭😭 Worst pain in my life every 7-10 minutes so even though they were so painful I couldn’t walk or sleep, they weren’t close enough and I wasn’t dilated enough so they would send me home in a wheelchair🤠Only got an epidural because I was so sleep deprived and I had already gotten the fentanyl which only me made me throw up during my contractions and I was dilating soooo danngggg slowww I went from 5 cm to 10 cm in a day😭 and it still took me an hour and an episiotomy to push him out and could still feel the whole thing 👁👄👁 But I would never trade my son for the world, the love a mother feels for her child is unreal and I still want more kids 🥰😂💗💗
وربي صدمه يتربى بعزك🥺🥺😭❤️.
Omg congratulations gurl 🥰🥰🥰 him handsome 🥰

Omgosh all that hairrrr so freakin cute 🥰
😂😂😂😂$hutthefkuppppp riiight LOL congratulations mama beautiful baby 4 natural births so I feel you!  The 5th one well I didn’t feel $$$hit epidural
You can see the pain in her toes god bless her I remember this 13 years ago I went through every moment of this and 14hrs and 5 pushes later my baby boy was hear
The scream made me change my mind I don't want kids , I was like oh shit😳
Bruh I just found out she was pregnant last week and hes already here he's cute tho🤗
I’m lmao @ the comments of how her screaming scared them from ever having kids. I screamed like this too and probably traumatized the entire labor & delivery ward. Maybe they should use videos like this in sex Ed classes instead. Seems more effective 😂😂
Br?🇧🇷
“The first poop felt Auhmazing, i needed that”
The baby boy is really cute... 😍😍😍 Congratulation... 🎉🎉🎉
He so cuteeeee😍😍😍😩
He got da same birthday as meeee
congratulations Nicole for the baby

Haha wish I could joke like u when my time comes it's not easy yoo
Very beautiful baby!! He was turning his head and held it up🤣🤣 Making way for another one🤣🤣😘😘congratulations new mommy
Nicole: screaming Subtitles: [Music] [Applause]
Ommmmmg how muchh i love this couple 😂❤

Yayyyy wait so she teen mom I guess
Oh my God,you are one crazy ass person😂😂 gosh she even twerkin, I'm so proud of you, you gonna be a great mom

Nicole's water breaks: makes youtube video immediately

Im 15 weeks pregnant and I’ve really been going through emotional stuff and moving and this is my first pregnancy and I’m very scared to have the baby I wish I had her confidence and strength while she was in labor but I can never see myself acting that way bc I’ve been very depressed and I take everything to seriously I hope my life changes for the better soon or idk what I’m gonna do

I was scared when she scream, but with the stfu omg i laugh 🤣🤣
I know you have a baby🎉 Graduate is a girl boy on for n
Wow just a new born and his eyes are opened wide
Congratulations omg i can't believe that, she had a baby 😭💜💜
Imma be real honest at first I didn't like her because of all the memes but watching her have fun and enjoy her life I came to love watching her videos and when I found out she was pregnant I was like "this child is going to have a crazy fun loving mom" and that is the best thing in life when you can have fun and love life I'm a mom as well and seeing you as a first time mom go through labor and not take an epidural is proof that you are a strong woman. I didn't have a choice to do a natural birth because my baby went into distress so I had a C- section. just want to say I'm proud of you and your husband and that you will make an amazing mom.
Hi tell Uzziah

Omg the scream😬 he is so beautiful though he came out amazing in so happy for yall congrats
كم عمرها ؟
This is so unbelievably fake. I can't believe ACTUAL women are falling for this video🤒 Good lord... People will believe anything. I can kind of get guys not knowing better, but ladies, y'all should know this isn't a real pregnant woman or a woman at all. It's a silicone moondump first off. Pregnancy doesn't make your back darker lol, and people with male skeletons can't handle pregnancy or get pregnant in the first place. No joke. "She" can't even pretend to get up or walk like a real pregnant woman. I've been babysitting since I was 9 and my sister just gave birth, I know a real pregnant gal when I see one! Learning anatomy very well, shows a world that we didn't know was here the entire time; A world where people pretend to be pregnant when they're biological males. I know two doctors that know about this huge secret deception; one of them works in California on mainstream celebrities, and yes, they're all lying. "All the world's a stage" is the realest quote there is. Check out the channel Michelle XYZ to hear from a medical professional who works on these creeps. I'm being dead serious and I'm not crazy, I have researched this more than enough, and once you learn anatomy well (it can take months), you'll know I'm telling the truth.
Ngawww Nicole congratulations for the any he's beautiful and Thank you for sharing I loved every moment of it
Dam she did a lot of screaming 🥴🤣
Congratulations 🎊🎉🎈
Hi I love you ❤😘 can you let my channel reach 10k or 100k please I'll appreciate😊🙏❤ it thanks much if you see this.. Maybe god bless you and your family
Omg his second name is the same as mine (Kalyston Kaylon)
happy birthday baby boy
Será que eu sou a única brasileira que acompanha e ama ela ? 🇧🇷
MESSIAH AND I HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY OMG!!!
Check out our reaction to Nicole Tv Amazing Birth Guys
Só eu do Brasil AQui?

"chi am I bleeding I feel liquid , am i peeing on myself? "   Oh it's that wap it's that wap 😂😂😂

Even her screams are funny 😂

This is off topic but just encouraging everyone that life is short. Tooo short. It’s so sad that anyone of us reading this right now can here today and gone tomorrow. So please, if you’re reading this, please make it right with Christ (if you didn’t already) because if you miss heaven, you won’t miss hell 🙏✝️ I don’t know you personally but trust me, I want you to make it 🤗 and yes, Christ is recording this exact moment where I’m telling you all of this. So, on judgement day, He’ll replay this exact moment for you and you will have to give an account of your entire life. I really want this account that you’ll have to give to be one where He’s proud of you and He’ll say “well done my good and faithful servant”.
"I feel like i doodooing"SHE IS THE MOST FUNNY PERSON THAT JOKES AROUND WHILE GIVING BIRTHH

I'm from Brazil and I love your videos❤️❤️❤️❤️
you better teach him how to do a ponytail 🙄💅
I love this ❤️ your a mom now...😭😭😭 CONGRATULATIONS 🍾🎈🎉
The sensation of giving birth is really something else. Without being induced (which is pretty much pain in a drip) you can handle labor pain but that induced pain hits different. Waves of pain just wash over you. Your whole body lights up with it and you have to be quiet and get through it. Thats without epidural. You can do it if you don't panic and all other factors health wise are in your favor. You pray. Stay calm. Listen to the nurses. Listen to your body. You'll be fine.   Congratulations to you both. 💛
“Is this the drugs talkin, know what we ain’t even finna do this” 😂😂💙
Beautiful hair 🥺🥺

Trust the Lord and have faith always!

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👌👌🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️
How are you sure that sunglasses
de uma coisa eu sei, que não posso ser a única brasileira a ver os vídeos da Nicole tv sem entender nada, e mesmo assim continua por que ela é incrível.
this is seriously the sweetest and realest birth vlog i’ve ever seen! You guys are such a cute family, and your son is very lucky to have you as his parents. you’re gonna do great 🤍 i couldnt imagine having to go through this alone which i was lucky enough not to, i’m so glad you got to have your love next to you through it all. Its such a special moment that both parents should be able to experience. For them to take that away from some is just horrible. You live together, so why do they split couples up ugh. Enjoy the newborn stage, it goes by so so fast 🤍
I'm sorry but I laughed when she said shut the fuck up
I didn’t know she was pregnant ! Wtf
يمهه متت اخاف لما اتزوج*****😭😭💔.
I miss you crack head 😭
Oh Jesus worse than period cramps oh God
I thought this girl was like 15
الحمدلله على السلامه يا نيكول مبروك ما جبتي 😌♥️♥️♥️
Nice, congratulations, my soul💛💛💛
I think I just gonna adopt a baby

Is he white?
When she started talking about the mamas doing it alone, I bawled my eyes out cuz I’m a single mama I had my daughter December 27th of 2020, I had my momma there in the room with me I had a c section. And recovery was hard and living alone and being my daughter’s only parent In her life it’s hard fr. But the way she spoke only reminded me that God chose me to be my baby’s mom because he knows I’m strong of enough to push through anything for her. And any single mom out here we got this momma
Bro the “Ian give a fuck” got meee😭😭
Congratulations both of y'all 😘
thanks for ur screaming kayla, now im scared of giving birth-😭✋🏼
And THAT is why you always get the epidural lmaoooo
Lol black people try to be lit at any time lol
omg as soon as he was born, they bonded~ that is so cute 🥰
“i can’t calm down shut the fuck up” 😭
CONGRATULATIONS GIRL❤️❤️❤️
She look like a balloon 🙄😂😅
Who ever didn’t love the video well the ending is a HATER 💜💕 yess team ♒️♒️♒️
These babies so nosey these days. Coming out the womb holding they head up.😂🤣 Boy if you don’t lay down, you just got here. What is you doing?🤣
She so funny 😂
The push sound
Who is God? God is dead, what’s next? Simply the next strongest being. God was nothing but a fairytale who held immense power. An omnipotent being, an all seeing celestial. So what? Why should that diminish the value and word, human? The term human is loosely tossed around. A human is nothing more of a being with sentience. Well, a greater sentience than a being on this planet anyway. All ‘humans’ have a limit. Some greater than others. Yet, no one has ever breached their limit have they? Humans have immense potential, enough potential to become gods themselves. But no one will be God that’s depicted in these literatures. All except me. No, this isn’t arrogance, it’s simply I know the truth of my existence and my purpose. People need God, so I shall be known as God. Except, the word God has also been used loosely. God is nothing more than a species. Once I am known, once people start following me and write these “literatures” about me, then, the world will come to know the name Truth. I speak nothing but the truth. My godhood ascendency will be nothing less of willpower. That is me, breaking my limits. If it happens after I pass away in death, so be it. I’ll create my own afterlife. If I am somehow mistaken and an after life already exists, I’ll just become the new ruler. Nothing in life or death will stop me. I am your new God, at least I will be. And once I am, I will purge the earth back into the dark ages. That will show my superiority. That will show me my level of commitment. Hope you have a nice day, see you once I become known as Truth.
Thats how I screamed during delivery too ...like if I was in a horror... dont think I cursed the nurses tho but also doubt they told me to calm down lololol...

I want to see my baby coming out my cat (lip smack) who don't 😂😂 Yes, I remembered I was upset when I had to get a c-section and the doctor said I couldn't watch. My whole pregnancy that's the one thing I was looking forward to.
Nicole: We about to set the phone up somewhere. They be telling us we cant record but who ain't gonna capture this moment tf Me: Yaassss Queen. Talk your shhhh!!
“I CANT CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP”
I’m glad you kept that same personality and I hope and wish the best for you🤞🏾

Nobody  Nicole ahhhhhhhh shut the f*** up
I didn't wanted to have kids bc i was scared of the childbirth then i saw this video and saw hiw cute is the baby and now i think that it's worth it
Congratulations! This is so beautiful! God bless your family ❤️💕
Que fofura !😍
I learned the hard way about the names you choose for kids, just saying.
You can't name your son messiah!!  What is another word for Messiah?  other words for Messiah  Christ. Good Shepherd. Jesus. King of Kings. Lamb of God. Lord of Lords. lord. savior.  You most change his name immediately!! Are you crazy to be calling your son God the creator of all!!   You are in big trouble!!!
😉❤🕊
Hearing labor screams for the first time has terrified me....I'll just adopt
Congratulations for the baby🥺🥳

LOOL. You screaming sounded exactly like me... I was pushing for 28 minutes thats IT before my child was born, and the fucking doctor said i "needed a kick in the ass, i just wasted a contraction" she was rushing me because she had other shit to do.. Awful experience lol. And she said "last time i got her mad she pushed really hard " so she made me mad again, and as a result of that i needed 27 stitches because i tore from my vagina to my asshole. Im glad you cussed her out lol they get VERY in your face and its hard to stay in control when the head is stretching you so far.. Congrats mama.

I never seen a female be this funny in labor lol girl u did that! May god bless y’all sis 💯💯💯❤️❤️❤️ I love thisb
Awwwwww🥺
That's why young girls shouldn't be having babies. Labor is very painful and hard but cursing out the nurses and doctors while doing their job in helping YOU is disrespectful and very immature.
“is this the drugs talking” LMAOOO 😂😂
يا ويلي ولدت ذي ام الرقص 😭😭💔💔💔
1 word Respect❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️

Congratulations to the both of you with your new arrival. He is beautiful  just like his parents. But I hate to break  it to you. He just got here and he already  was doing  the most. I am definitely  old-school. He is already  trying  to move out the way for another  little  one.  He might  have a lil sister/ brother  sooner than planned.  🙏  for health  and healing.🎈🎈🎉❤
مبروك
She was born already smiling, so cute 😍
i saw this and and said aloud, "NIcOLE tV HaD A bbAy?"
im soooo happy for you! you did amazing thru your pregnancy and delivery. newborns come out looking like ugly aliens lol but yours is soooo perfect. youre gonna be a great mother and i know youll support every decision he makes. i love you and good luck! <3
That scream ahh that scared me to death
Wow 😮! The miracle of birth. God is just AWESOME! welcome baby 😘. And kudos to those health workers. And hail the woman 😍
Why she play so much?! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Hurting & still making jokes & dancing! I love her!
Congratulations dear God preserves it + can you put an Arabic translation because I follow you a lot but I do not understand anything and I am now using a language change program please if you saw my comment put an Arabic translation please 🖤♥
“You don’t make children by yourself” YOOOO she is wise beyond her years 🥺  Edit: some of you guys missed the context of what I was trying to point out. I was talking about when she was saying how awesome he is for sticking with her through this. A lot of so called "men" just leave the girl to deal with the kid on her own and they don't wanna take responsibility for the part they played in creating them. If he was that type he could have easily just cut off all contact with her but him being as supportive as he has been is a wonderful thing. She was reminding the girls out there that ARE doing this alone without the father that it is not 100% their fault the child exists. Nobody just wakes up pregnant without being with a guy. THATS what I meant when I said she was wise for seeing it that way. She full well knows it was the TWO of them together that got them into parenthood.  Yeah no duh its common sense two people are needed to make them, but she's talking about everything that comes AFTER getting pregnant.  Open your brains up!
Amazing good job 🥺❤️
This is y men should respect woman. The pain we have to go through to deliver babies.
Congratulations
I was more nervous and scared watching the video than what she actually was during her round 4
7.9 in 3 days it take ddg solo music videos to do that in a mouth😂😂

the most extra pregnant woman i have ever seen
Nicole: am I bleeding? 🥺 😳 Also Nicole: IT'S THAT WAP THAT WAP 🤪 😹
Congrats.....you are the 1st woman that I've ever heard tell the doctor to go "SHUT THE FUCK UP". Messiah is very handsome. Anything that you & his dad decided to do, pertaining to Messiah, is strictly y'all decision. Nobody else's.
Is nobody talking about the inspirational rant she did in round 4 I love it
I think it’s crazy that hospitals ban people recording their child’s birth... all because of liability if the doctor fucks up or something.. anyways what a beautiful baby boy ❤️❤️❤️ he was literally smiling
Y’all are amazing!! God bless🤍
Congrats kiddos
AT THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT LABOR IS SO PROUD OF HER 🥺❤️

Cute 😭😭💕
O tırnaklarla bebeğe nasıl dokunacak acaba
Fofo o bebê
يا عرب لا تخلوني لحالي
ليش لونه ابيض؟؟
Fun fact: you didn't search for this
I still can’t believe she cussed out the nurses 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You are sooooo strong 💪🏽 breathing while in labor  is hard enough for women but you did it with a MASK 💘
*Respect*
😍😍😍
Her screaming make me not wanna give birth
I'm proud !💜 Your a mother now🥺
في احد عربي
q coisa mais linda mds, já nasceu rindo kkkkk
Congratulations to the New Little Family 🥰🥰💗 💕
She really told them to shut the fuck up 😭✋
Congratulations 🥰
16:33 : she screaming to get the baby out meanwhile the cc : music / applause  great
아기 귀엽다♡
اكو عرب هون؟!
مبروك 🥳
remember when we were embarassed bc our parent drop us in front of the school...imagine Messiah looking at Nicole's videos
She is really something .......wonderful and so strong  , basically in birth videos   these screaming part is not shown it's first time I'm seeing it and its really something  .  I seriously got goosebumps.😌😌. The baby is really cute  and parents are so perfect and made for each other🤩😍😍
How old even are you??🤔
هل يوجد عرب اكلكم الطفل ابيض😂
The cursing was not necessary and this is why when BW come to the hospital WE are 3 to more times likely to di3 in child birth!!! I understand this young lady is a comedian, but the way she acted did have a NEGATIVE reflection on the rest of the community!! As a FYI , BW should be mindful of how you present yourself when  seeking medical attention. I promise you, nobody thinks its cute when you are rude and disrespectful!! Nobody wants to come to work and deal w/that! PREGNANCY OR NOT!! Dont blow it off and say "Oh they are used to it"!! Nope thats not how it goes! Be respectful! Be civil!! Be mindful of the next BW who is coming after you ~~And she gets a provider -- who lets her HEMORRAGE TO d3@th!!!
Your son is beautiful ❤
She is wonderful one ❤ thing i love 💘 about her is happiness matters alot more grace Good health you and your family's, you will never lack in Jesus name amen
Wait this meme bitch has a kid now-
“I can’t calm down shut the fuck up” This was me af lmao
When I realize the baby bday a day after mine😍
Meus parabéns que bebê mais lindo ❤❤❤
I really dislike that they still have women birthing on their back.  It's not natural and makes it so much more difficult.  But I am So happy for them both!!!  Thank you for sharing your journey with us.
Congratulations Nicole I really can't believe this I feel like I'm an aunt now! 😭❤️
Im just so happy for you guys ❤️
He’s so beautiful😍
كيوت 😓🥺🥴
“I can’t calm down shut the fuck up!!!!” 😩🤣🤣
I really cried when you screamed during childbirth
that little boy is a little white, dont you think sooo?
I'm kinda glad for all these scared ppl in the comments...pregnancy and labor is no joke and sometimes ppl glamorize the process a lil too much. Remember a whole human comes out that tiny hole🙃 ..Good thing women's bodies were created to do this😅 (couldn't nobody tell me God wasn't real and this is all an "accident" after seeing a pregnancy and birth)
مبرووككك
“I’m trynna look presentable” I can’t😭😭💀
“Guhhh bring yo a$$ on”
This my 3rd time watching this😭❤❤❤
SOU BRASIL AMO SEU CANAL❤🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷❤
Dia yang suka di jadiin meme ga sih?  Ya ampun ternyata hamil wahh selamat yaaaaa
SERIOUSLY!!! When she yelled “I can’t calm down STFU” I felt that!!! Whew my first birth was the exact same way!!! It’s hard work and those tears are insanely painful
Wait a minute is she wearing a mouth mask😳😳😳 in this condition...damn
Did she just tell the nurse shut up XD I know the nurses are like 😡😑
Congratulations girl lots of love
Elle est trop belle Messiah avec son sourire déjà. Vous lui avez transmis votre joies de vivre. Vis bien et longtemps bébé
this made me tear up, she was so happy. congrats!!!

Wait is her real name Mikayla? I swear that’s what the nurses were calling her while she was pushing? 🤔🤔

Congratulations! I just had my daughter February 2nd by cesarean. I could not do what you just did since I have a 0 pain tolerance and let me tell ya this pain is unbearable and the only reason I'm able to make it is bc of my mom lol. It's such a beautiful experience and I still can't stop crying but damn is it scary too! I'm holding my daughter as I type this, she's fast asleep. 💖🍼 I'm sad her daddy couldn't be there but I had my mom with me the whole time, I even had to have a blood transfusion bc I was anemic, it's definitely all worth it in the end. ❤

“Guh bring yo ass on” 😂
잔머리 정리해주고싶다
that baby fresh out the womb holding his damn head up already! that’s amazing
Beautiful, active (lifting his head) and talkative! Looks like the BOTH of you too. 💞💞💞💖💖💖💙💙💙💖💖💖💞
ive been sad but when told the nurses the stfu that made me giggle😭😭
I hope that she apologized for cussing at that lady for helping her with her baby lol
Omggg when Malachi was cuddling wit him
You write that baby show look like him and I'm so happy for you have a good life little baby
مبروك يتربى بعزكم يارب🙏🏻🤍🇸🇦🥺
Thank you for sharing this is such a good video
I CANT CALM DOWN STFU........ awwww.. 😂😂😂😂😂 I was cracking up lol the the best L&D video . He’s beautiful! Congratulations
Hey messiah welcome to the world 🥰 you are very adorable and sweet. Mommy will probably teach you how to move like a snake one day so be ready. I’m happy you and your family ❤️
Honestly, the thought of having to raise a baby is what keeps me thinking that when I adopt (im a lesbian, and asexual) im probably going to adopt an older kid, or a teen, because there are so many wonderful amazing people in the world that just need a caring figure in their life, maybe not even as a parent, just more like a close friend, who you happen to be the legal guardian of. I sure as hell know i would have loved that when i was a teen.
He look just like his daddy
おめでとうございます
Congrats!

My anxiety after watching this just confirmed that not everyone is meant to give birth. I am DEFINITELY one of those people. Seems like a horrid (or beautiful depending on you views) experience to go through.

OMG HER YELL.THATS IT I AINT HAVING KIDS😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃

Girl I'm not here to judge but all that screaming 🙉 I had a 32 hr labor 30 mins of pushing 9lb baby boy (now 11 yrs old)...no epidural and never screamed! Guess different strokes for different folks but congratulations and he's beautiful ❤️❤️
Nobody: Nicole: I wanna see my baby come out my cat who don’t Side note I never have seen her this serious on camera
Did she tell the nurse to STFU? 😂😂
HEEEY GUURRL!! U SHOULD STOP RECORING THE BABY IT IS SO DANGEROUS TO HIIM JUST WAIT
محد خاف مره 😶😂
Might have been the drugs, but that’s NO 🧢. We don’t make babies by ourselves so these daddies need to step up more often.

Does she still do school?  I loved ger since day one tho Just wondering

Thank you for showing black men are and can be supportive during labor. This isn’t shown much and it made me soo happy to see how he catered and supported you through allll of this.
She took that shit like a g honestly
The fact that she told dem to stfu 😭
This birth felt the realist birth to my baby girl birth  I ever watched on the YouTube, her scream though its the same as mine 😩❤️
CHOCADAAAAAAAAAAA
I bet she cute
the baby has your eyes nicole
Minha nossa senhora 16:30 edi1 (Amo seus vídeos ♡)
"shut the fuck up" 😭
She told he husband to STFU and I was weak!
That towel look too tight to me round the neck but AW HE SO HANDSOME 🥺 HIS PARENTS BLESSED. GJ
I at first always thought that I didn't want a child cuz I knew that it would be painful but now I'm not even close to the age of when I'm going to have a child but if I ever want one I'd want to actually have one like give birth I feel like that time zone of pain is worth giving life having a child it's definitely worth it. Also being pregnant and having a child doesn't mean you have to naturally give birth you can get the baby surgically taken out cuz it can cause you to have to get stitches like she did so you don't technically need to have a child in that way.
“ You dont make children by yourself” 💯
Awww he ket lifting up his head... Now ik when I get pregnate imma get an epidural xD
I was dew February 15 she came January 30 congregation he handsome
I love her
I don't know but I'm so fucking happy
My first son was no epidural because he was coming out as soon as I got to the hospital so I also felt the tear and he came out with 3 pushes God bless your family ❤
Your baby is so beautiful

Congratulations Kayla and Malachi! Your baby is a cutie pie 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Lol she wearing a whole dress looking dressed up like she going to a photo shoot or something..😂 I would’ve went there wit some sweatpants and a T-shirt wit some slides lolll😂😂😂😂
Omg after listening to kayla scream i got so scared. I've always been scared of childbirth. I'm definitely going to need the emotional support before 😭😭😭😭
Nicole começa a colocar tradução em baixo da fala❤
"SHUT THE FUCK UP" LMAO that was the best part. I love how you are going through labor and you are just so positive. WE LOVE YOUUUU, MALIK, AND MESSIAH :)
He’s so cute congratulations 🥳, I have been a fan for about 2 or 3 years and I love your content and your energy
It's the sunglasses in the dark for me😂
I promise the pain is worth it if you want to have kids. I Had an epidural so I can't speak on natural birth but I would do it again. The worst part was the contractions for me but my labor and delivery was very quick. Contractions felt like extreme period cramps and I didn't know I was in labor for a long time. But seeing my child lift her head and look at me was the best feeling. There is no other feeling that can compare. Also you will surprise yourself with the amount of strength you have.  Women are strong just remember that.
Its a girl or boy
Stfu i-
May god watch over and help this child learn to speak
♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
He’s adorable ❤️
Hot mess. And shes some ones mom. How embarrassing.
136?! I haven’t been 136 in YEARSSS I’m jelly

WhErE Ma LiP GlAwS ✋😭
He seems like he’ll be a very good baby. Very well tempered. Doesn’t cry. Congratulations he’s soooooo adorable 🥰
This shit took me back 22 yrs ago... Lmao! Will NOT do this again, EVER!!! Congrats! Y'all that don't get the epidural, are some Gs
I give her all respect for her putting on that outfit cause I thought yo water break and it’s time to go 😂👉🏽👉🏽
I went through this 2 times.. this is how my first time was. I was in labor for 13 hours with my son 🤦🏽‍♀️
Congratulation on our messiah.though every pregnancy is different .
*awe the child looks so cute even i hate kids and now i don't wanna get kidss*
I'm so so happy for you 🤗

Nicole:buss it.  Bf come one
I loved the part when she said babe we shouldn't had sex.... Lol 😂😆
So that’s how cavemen women b giving birth back then?
Why is white 😭😭????
Awww the baby so cute🥺💕
You should not be allowed to scream while you are pushing, you have just to push, I give birth and I couldn’t scream while pushing, I know how hard and painful is that. Also the sleeping on the sofa in that way is not safe, you fell asleep and the baby can fall down from the sofa. All the best, you baby is adorable 😍
congratulations 🎊 on your new baby boy ❤️❤️
awww he look just like his daddy 🥺🥺💕
HOW MANY SEASONS DID I MISS

Oh she be playing, in the middle of labor & talking about jumping on that 'D'....wow! I didn't wanna see or hear about no 'D'  Wise choice to get him circumcised, I didn't and my son has had problems for half his life because he didn't know how to clean it properly. Now, he's 13 and I'm considering getting him circumcised. Smh!

I had the worst pregnancy ever but the easiest labor. My heart goes out to her in all the pain. My labor was induced and my water broke soon after and then I had an epidural. I literally felt nothing. Just period like cramps before I went into labor. I know so many women that had epidurals and still felt pain 🥺 My baby ripped me too.
God bless all mothers🙏
Messiah is such a beautiful name 💙 congratulations momma
Miss you💗💗

Congrats on the new life.... Chile I felt your pain, I gave natural birth twice myself but the first time I had to have 6 stitches! I broke one side of my bed rail, cursed ppl out and transformed🤣I can laugh about it now but it wasn't funny then. I have 5 children,  3 boys n 2 girls. Now, the funny thing is I was able to push my girls out but with my boyz I had to have a c- section. My last two are twin boyz, my first was a boy but he was killed in 2016 on Dec 22 nd, I am blessed with grand children from him. Keep that beautiful child prayed up n I know y'all are great parents.💗
Can we talk about how much hair he has🥺
Congratulation dear

Rip to headphones user
I CANT CALM DOWN SHUT THE FAWK UP scared me
he’s so precious omg
how a person cannot love and respect his mother???
Also birthing on your back is EXTREMELY unproductive if you’re interested in natural labor I strongly suggest other positions gravity is your friend!!
😍💙
Congrats you guys! He is beautiful and sooo fast omg!! He's super alert😍I can't wait to see more of him
I just wanna say right now that the first few months of your babies life will test your relationship with your husband like nothing else something about the sleep deprivation months on end while you watch your partner take a peaceful nap will piss you off to and unbelievable extent . Just know that it gets hard but you have to remember the good and remember how this is all just a phase and your baby will grow up and he’ll learn to sleep through the night and you’ll be rested eventually and your husband will try his hardest day and night for that sweet baby and congratulations natural birth is something to celebrate that’s a huge accomplishment and a great example of why women and the preferred gender
her: screams the captions: [music and applause]
SHUT THE FUCK UP😡... awww look at you🥺 I’m dead💀
My son is named messiah.  Beautiful  name.
You look presentable

It's definitely not all sunshine. Thanks for uploading a real vid!

Congrats
I’m not crying 🥺🥺🥺 this was a rollercoaster and worth the watch for sure ❤️❤️❤️ best wishes to you and yours
I never gave birth I just heard experiences & watched videos but I never understand why they have the mother laying down on her back while pushing it’s like trying to poop laying down it’s gonna be harder to get it out to me it just makes sense to be in a sitting type position or a position you feel most comfortable in (tho Ik it’s gonna be uncomfortable still) but it’s just easier for the doctor if the mother is laying down which doesn’t help the mother but Idk that’s just my opinion      Their baby is so cute 😭❤️
OMG he's born on my birthday
awwwww🥺🤍🤍
💗💗💗
Congrats
Congratulations he is so beautiful!!!!

My mom had 6 kids only my oldest brother with an epidural and my 2nd oldest brother had ripped her and was 10 pounds I couldn’t even imagine the pain u went through
SOMEBODY DO THE NATAL CHART OF THIS BABY LIKE PLEASEEEEEE

شكون عربي هنا قولو اشهد ان لاالله الا الله 🙏🏻
I sounded just like you 😂😂😂😂 my nurses were like hey the Dr doesn't like that.. bitch stfu if you don't want me to cuss then you push him out.
Having a child is so beautiful and precious (after the fact) but its so scary for some people to think about because they don't wanna go through pain or nothing. Women are the key to life and that's a fact.

What a cutie 😍
Congratulations 🎉 but sis you needed a doula. Some of what you experienced could've been prevented with support and knowledge from a birth doula. First-time moms should birth how they feel will benefit them but if they feel like having a natural birth, please do not look at this experience and Opt into unnecessary interventions because birthing natural can be calm and serene. Follow @susanthebirthdoula on Instagram to learn more.
Wow so cute

That baby was conceived and born into love and that's such a beautiful thing! Congratulations you guys!
Congratulations on your new blessing. May God continue to bless your family
atleast you still got your wig on😂😂😂😂
🥺❤️❤️
The epidural also drugs the baby so basically your baby is drugged when he or she enters the world and I’m pretty sure it’ll have some sort of impact in their life later on ,, I think we should start going back to natural births
He’s beautiful 🥰 congratulations.
She can’t take nun seriously omggg I keapt laughing 🤣🤣🤣
my heart!,=*×;=*×,=*+ cute?+,=*×
Congratulations 🎉 i know the feeling i gave natural birth to 3 sons💪🏻   Little tip- when your son is sleeping u do the same..  grand-parents - are there for a reason if they offered to help take it😘  Enjoy motherhood God Bless🙏🏼
Congrats mama💓😍
He! Is! Sooooo cute!!😄😄😄❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

That baby pretty asf
I’m so glad I had it easy. My labor was only a half hour at home and it felt like stabbings. I told my midwife she told me stay home THEN I FELT HIS HEAD POKE OUT BUT MY WATER DIDNT EVEN BREAK!! I got ubered to the hospital (Uber driver was deff an ex nascar racer cos he deff ran every red light and swerved) I got to the hospital they didn’t even have time for a doctor. I almost dropped my son in the toilet, he literally came flying out in one push and during that push my water also broke. So, I had it easy. I kinda wish I felt what y’all felt cos I hear y’all stories and I’m like... wow.
Congratulations on y’all new bundle of joy 💙

Hahaha after this a lot of women would say “ I’m not gonna have a baby.”  I screamed exactly the same as her, gave birth without any pain relief. I’m so lucky the labour lasted less than 2hrs only as 1st time mum, but I got 3rd degree tear which is traumatizing for me thAn these contractions.

Kye is a good man. He’s right there for absolutely anything. You ask if you’re leaking and he’s right up in there checking you out. You said you had to pee and he bolted to your side to get you in the bathroom. He was right next to you the whole time you were pushing. He loves you so damn much and he’s gonna be a great dad.   And MESIAH oh my god. He looked at you with so much love in his eyes.
I still don't mind being single for more years, am not ready to scream lol....congrats sweet girl you made it, stay blessed😇😇
I’m confused...can someone tell me when one day I have a kid...should I get an epidural cause I sure don’t wanna be in pain screaming like Nicole Tv...now I’m scared to have children...I heard her scream and now...I’m scared

I wish I could like this post more then once
Why was I expecting her to give birth with her iconic ponytail idk y lol-
Pregnancy looked really good on you. Your skin was glowing this whole video. Edit: I really enjoyed your serious side. You have matured so much and I’m here for the next chapter. Your son looks like you! Just wait until you see photos of yourself as a baby and as he gets a little bit older. I can see his dad in him, but he favors his momma more at this point lol.
😭😭😭
Awwww, I remember those days...
The end 🥺🥺 congratulations!!
He is so precious. GREAT JOB MOM! Welcome to the team! This was the best labor & delivery video I’ve ever seen. Thank you for sharing🥰🥰🥰
She be strong
Congratulations ❤️

Girl. I didn't even know you were pregnant 😭
I feel bad for my mom now, cause she was in labor w me for over two days and she couldn't take any medication because of her blood type. Now I appreciate, lol

CONGRATULATIONS KAYLA AND HUBBY!!!GOD BLESS YOUR FAMILY
Salve daqui do Brasil🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
💀💀💀 I just love how you screamed “Stfu” then the video transitioned to you living on him... 😍 he’s so handsome .. congrats Kayla ! And may God continue to bless y’all ❤️ I love how you gave some appreciation to Malachi & also encouraged single pregnant mothers
Such a beautiful baby. You did good mama. Did they scream at you shut the f** up or did you scream at them? Because if somebody screamed at me and said that while I was delivering a baby I would’ve smacked them. They don’t have no right to scream at you. However a woman in labor can say anything she wants. Much love 💖💖💖
BABYYY, OMGGGG 😮😮😮😮 WOW
Kkkk eu sem saber falar inglês kkkk;-;
Also to daddy.. congrats.. ❤️❤️❤️.. God's blessings upon you and your family.. 💞💞
How do y’all hate a person giving birth? 🤦🏽‍♀️

مبروك🥰
Omg congratulations guys he is so handsome
has got to be the cutest youtube ever
She’s so right . Bringing children into this world is big business . The most important thing we are tasked with as women - don’t waste it on someone that isn’t worthy Edit : If you don’t agree with the “ most important thing “ that’s ok . It’s my opinion. It may not be the most important thing to you , that’s ok ❤️
Wow
Hey mommy!!!
Byee😭 "Do you know your Megan baby? I think you're Megan baby big stallion ass"🤣🤣
U r realy strong mom, congratulations sweet heart ❤️
Awww 🥰 definitely feel you on that, first time mom too no epidural it is hard but my thought was once you push you’re done. Also I didn’t get any stitches my nurse told me not to scream so I don’t rip.

Congratulations
"Is these the drugs talking?" sent me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The child should sleep to grow up when he becomes a month old. You can play with him, and the phone screen should not be placed in his face, because nothing will understand except that he will get sick and this child is not his game to play but a spirit
Congratulations🎉🎉🎉🥰   My husband and I said we were going to have our last baby this year.
Congratulations
Congratulations hun 🥳🥳🥳🥳

Did anyone else think of her saying “prezzureee” when she said pressure or was it just me?😭
So cute
To the person reading this God loves you

아기 축하해요! (Congratulations)
I’m glad you had a wonderful experience. I did pretty well with my daughter even though I did get the epidural but with my son it was much harder, I guess because his dad wasn’t really there like he should’ve been and what you said on round 4 really hit me hard because I did have to go through it alone and still am! But at the end of the day I trust God and can nobody have me like God can!  I’m really proud of you and happy for you! Congrats on your baby boy and may you never have to do any of it alone! God bless you!
CONGRATULATIONS!!
What a cutie babyyy *-*
Dammmmmmm I said never again after my 2nd one! Had to push all 8lbs out! My first was 6lbs and a csection

I’m sorry but it’s the “STFU” for me🤣🤣 dawg that was soo me 💀 but congratulations y’all we finally see our YouTube nephew 💙 $MoneyGetter1000
Congratulations on your new bundle of Joy you did great ma ❤ 💖 👏 💕  Her parents were probably in the waiting room guys.  Remember it's still COVID-19 and hospitals are only allowing 1 person to be in the room with you during birth at all times. So they may even be home waiting until she gets there.  Because I only could have 1 person with me and naturally you want the father there with you especially for their 1st child.  Most parents especially if your not an only child already got to experience seeing their child gave birth of a grandchild.  Most parents also understand the rules of the hospital due to COVID-19 and may have been watching via a video.... I'm sure her parents are happy she's ok and their grandchildren is here healthy.
Congratulations 😭😭😭😭❤he's soooooo beautiful 😭🥺😭🥴❤❤❤
What a beautifull baby boy! 💙🎉🧸 Congratulations!
Contcrats love you
My baby brother had the same name but he didnt make it😥 but congrats ❤💙💚💜
Y’all missed the fact that she actually named her son Jesus... saviour of the world? 👀👀. And she’s not even a Christian? 👀☕️Congrats for the safe delivery tho 👏🏾

Baby too sweet
You must appreciate the support everyone has for you, 4.8M people came to witness the best moment with you ❤🖤
Omg
i got a problem with an epidural when anesthesiologist ruptured my spinal membrane...worst headache ever 100,000 worse than a contraction. At the end of my hellish delivery the nurse told me: " Whenever I have a baby I will go natural because Ive seen too many epidural complications and it isnt worth it." Wish she had told me that before I got mine. It didnt work anyways and felt everything. Go Natural !
CONGRATZ QUEEN
Congratulations and best wishes 🎉

Really happy for you
He so handsome!! Congratulations Nicole!! You did sooooo good!❤❤❤
Congratulations on the arrival of your gorgeous baby boy! I think what you said, even under the effects of medication! That it's important to wait to have a baby with someone who wants a baby too, someone who is going to be there for you and the baby regardless. All the best from my family to yours.
Not her doing the Buss it challenge while in labor. Nicole is clearly another breed. ❤️😂
I like ur voice!
This is the most adorable thing I've seen so far 😍
“ i can’t claim down shut the fuck up” 😭😭😭 that part takes me out

They didn't ask you to remove your fake nails (if that is it)  or cut that long nails...  Anyways,,, congrats!!!!!! So cuteeee
Congratulations Kayla , God bless you and your family ❤️

her bussin while in labor was too much😂😂
"IT CAN'T GO DOWN STFU" im deadddd
No it wasn’t the drugs talking 😂😂 I felt the exact same way when I had my daughter. It really makes you appreciate all the love and support you have from your partner, I couldn’t imagine doing it alone. And these new babies are something else 😂 they claim they not supposed to lift their heads until a few months old, my baby came out just like him trying to look at me. Congratulations and welcome to motherhood, it’s hard at times but it’s a beautiful thing. You’re gonna love it here! 😂😍
CONGRATS HES BEAUTIFUL ✨❤️
I'm sooooo damn jealous of men 😭😭 knowing this is reality if I ever want biological kids is terrifying AF😥 I wish we could stand on the sidelines and do nothing like the guys.
Nobody gonna talk about how cute the baby is and how calm it is by his mom
الف الف مبروك يتربى في عزكم ربي يحفظولكم ان شاء الله
NO I CANT IM CRYING OF LAUGHH "STFU" 16:45 noooo bahahhahahhahaah
“I can’t go down stfu!” Omg that’s real labor right there yellin & all 😭😭😂😂😂
Seeing her baby, I have baby fever all over again! 🥺
Wow🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
They seem like the type of parents that would curse at and around the child. Hope I'm wrong but I doubt it
“This that wap” 😂😂😂
Girl I had no clue she was pregnant but congrats ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Bravo tes la meilleure
Her in labor:STFU   Her after labor:awwww💕   Me watching this video:👁👄👁

The baby is so sweet 😍 ..  I get mad at hospitals for bathing just born babies all the vernix is so important to the baby’s skin and they washed it off, not to mention that first moment for y’all ugh.   As a doula I really strive to provide my black mothers with information hospitals won’t tell them.
Congratulations motherhood is beautiful I got two back to back lol . God bless you , your boo and your new addition to your family.
Wait I didn’t knew she was pregnant lmao

Congratulations 👏
I’m a first time mom and i did a natural vaginal birth with no epidural or any medications as well i gave birth on August 4th 2020 to my son and that pain and pressure was no joke but i was only in labor for an hour and a half so it wasn’t too bad. The burning was the ring of fire and i screamed out too and the nurse had the nerve to tell me to try not to scream and just push through the burning i was like sis you not deadass.
Nicole-shut the fuck up
This the first time I’ve seen Kai acting up it just lets you know he’s so mf excited omg
Congrats On the baby i know ur going to be a great mom

THAT IS THE BABY WHO PUT ME ON TO YOU, SHE IS ALMOST 17 NOW :) I DID NOT GET AN EPIDURAL WITH 4 OF MINE. CONGRATS ON THIS BEAUTIFUL BOY. I CANNOT BELIEVE HE WAS DOING FULL PUSH UPS ON YOUR CHEST. HE WANTED THAT ITTY BITTY TITTY. AHAHAHA.
This was too chilled men!!
Omg😶😢❤
I SWEAR TO GOD HE’S SO CUTE IM CRYING AAAAA
Awww 😍
NICOLE HAS HER OWN FAMILY 🥺
He’s so precious 🥺 congrats love ! 💗
If you leave the baby on your chest they will naturally look for the nipple. Which is what he was doing. We make them lazy. But that scream and cussing them out was funny alot.
No the drugs were not talking I'm currently pregnant and I understand
Fuck this shit bye
“don’t get my titties”🤣🤣 i love her
I had no idea she was pregnant. Congrats Nicole!

Hi
I just felt so bad for u with my first son 22 yrs ago I was the same size as u so the pain for us becomes worse I was screaming just like u... 😆 only thing u did different from me was u didn't stand on the bed yelling I'm going home if u don't get this baby out me 🤣 congratulations 😘
Congrats ♥️
Youtube should ban all the videos spaming fake web sites. The only site that worked for me is Quickfollowz.
A honest shout out for QuickFollowz, the only site that gave me legit and active followers for free.
I’m so happy for you both 🤍 Messiah is gonna have a great life with you both!
Omgggg whoever disliked this video should feel bad bout they self her baby is adorable 🥰

Sending you all the love babe <33 im so happy for you and your family. you deserve the world.
Awwww him so handsome congratulations
Congratulations girl
Congratulations🎉🥳👏
He’s so freaking cute May god bless y’all 🥺❤️❤️❤️
yeah i aint never....
Cute baby but why he white?
Awwww! Congrats boo!! So happy for you! I’m a FTM too and I WILL be getting an epidural
that scream was scary but that shit hurt 😯 but she did well. Labor pain is no joke and she was awesome 👍. Even though the doctors don't want you to scream because it cuts off the oxygen for the baby. Everybody pregnancy and labor are different. I gave birth three times and I never scream but that pain is no joke. Please don't have to let the doctors have to break your water, then the labor pains come quickly.Congratulations beautiful baby boy. 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
The scream 😂😂😂n she cursingg 😭😂😂
All jokes aside....Ian never seen a cute newborn till this very moment 💆🏾‍♀️
Girl you’re braver than I was when I had my first child. I took the drugs, I told them to drug me up POST HASTE, I couldn’t take all that paaaiin. Congratulations on your new beautiful son. I’m so happy for you, I still can’t believe you’re someone’s momma now. Be blessed Nicole.
It was the toes curling for me
Trying to look presentable 😂😂😂 she looking bomb fir birth💕😜💣😎 Me smiling the while time like i am so happy for you💓

At 16:44 it had me😂but congratulations 💖
Well that's confirmation when I have kids I'm having an epidural
Geminis make awesome wives and mothers. We get a lot of hate but in our relationships we treat our other half like the world. When Kayla was talking about she always tell Kye he matters too I felt her 100%. I always used to lift my sons father up because men need reassurance too they’re just not vocal like us women.
At least he wasn't born with barely any hair and gonna be called baldy growing up... ...like me
if my dude don’t care for me how hers do iont want him
congratulations on your beautiful baby boy!! i was crackin up the whole time and you did great <3 much love

I understand your pain! I gave birth to my daughter December 2019 all natural! I'm so happy I had no epidural but damn it was the most painful thing feeling everything. my daughter was Sunnyside up so I had back labor which was awful but so worth it once she was finally here.
I had a epidural i was told natural burned and hurt like hell
this is the only vlog i’ve ever watched fully through
Who would dislike this. Omg she said shut the f up.
Congrats✨✨
I cried omg😭😭😭 Congratulations!!!
I didn't know that you where pregnant
All those screams really made me question if I wanna have kids 🥲.
I just love you omg 😭♥️ This made me so happy. Congratulations
I gave birth natural, no epidural & if I was to have another baby again, I would do it natural all over again. Yes, everyone’s birth & experiences are different but motherhood is painful yet beautiful.
Yeah he’s definitely his daddy son 🥰 congrats baby !!

19:42 word of advice for baby's safety please don't fall asleep with him like that at the opposite end he will role out your hands as soon as u fall asleep deep n get hurt please be safe I remember falling asleep with my baby like this and the nurse saved him ..then another time I put him on the bed and fall asleep n accidentally covered him under my sheet almost stifled my new born I didn't know better they teach me tho the nurses thought me well n don't fall asleep with him on your tummy either its also not safe for new borns❤ CONGRATULATIONS🥳🥳HE'S ADORABLE🤩...blessings all the way from Jamaica 🇯🇲 one love  Ohhhh one last thing take turns sleep and staying up with baby mr father you guys have night shift for at least 3 months...my son dad didn't help on night shifts with baby I fall asleep so many times with him rolling out my arms on the bed because of tiredness n trying to keep up❤❤❤take care and CONGRATULATIONS again
You handled it like a champ! Congratulations !!!Welcome Mesiah!
Your and yours husband’s energy intertwine so well together. So happy about your little angle on earth. I wish you a speedy recovery, healthy baby and peace to your man. love u!!
I'm so happy that you have a healthy baby boy and everything went well. A lot of my guy friends keep asking me if I'm not gonna have sex and I tell them not and their always asking me why so I said because: 1.I don't want an STD 2. I don't wanna get pregnant 3. He might tell all his friends 4. People might tease me about it and 5.I might get in BIG trouble if my mom found out . (I'm 15 btw)Even this morning someone asked me the same thing ,well I can always show them this video so they can see what a woman has to go through to give birth.
my bday is feb 1st monday  gurl said " STFU damn
Is the red mark one his eye his birth mark

Just saying bc you watch this video and you change your mind abt pregnancy and giving birth remember that everyone is different when giving birth but good luck in the future and stay strong :)
“ is these the drugs talking ?” 😂😂😂😂
The fact that you’re at 10 months is enough reason as to why your water broke. Sounds like the hospital staff actin rude.
Congrats to you and malachi! he is precious and with a whole head of hair!!  You did amazing mama! I don't know how you did it all natural but mega props!!! Enjoy these beautiful moments with him. Every day is a blessing. 💖🕊️

The name Messiah holds a lot of weight; so your kid  'MESSIAH",  better grow up to be a straight A student, graduate from Harvard, and have multiple PHD's! I swear, when he grows up, and if he turns out to be a no good dead beat  lame excuse for a man, I will personally find you guys and give you a piece of my mind!
Wait how old is she ?

Good JOB💝.  Your baby is so alert and darling... You seem like a very sweet couple.  God Bless.
He is so good to her. She couldn't have it any other way
The kid si White What the fuck
She's probably the one of the most excited mom's that don't feel tired when having a baby-
شو هالمينونه
I wish I could give naturally, but my cervix is too small so I can never dilate.. so I had to get a c section.. they tried to get me to dilate on IV medicine but it could’ve killed my son. It slowed his heart rate.. but you go girl! Congratulations
That screaming got me weak 😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰 My Jesús Christ

And thank you so much for sharing this with us love you❤️
Congrats! 4 kids here after the first learned to wait and listen to my body. Hated sitting for hours upon hours going through all this stuck in a room. With our twins I was 5cm 90% effaced first 3 weeks. Absolutely awful. Had the others natural couldn’t with the twins. Water broke went and they were transverse breech. Basically a T inside me lol C section was far worse (in my experience) than my natural labors. Congrats though and respect for holding out! It ain’t a thing until you get to 7+cm lol that’s when it gets serious. After your first watching you, you’ll definitely hold off longer and will be far easier and sure of yourself. I’m the same way joking even during situations like this lol
HE IS LITERALLY SO ADORABLE IH MY GOD
I start laughing when she start screening 🥺🤣
Her speech about relationships and pregnancy
Oh my gosh I’m so freaking happy for you the baby is beautiful I literally started crying during this so happy u have support blessings to you and your beautiful family🥰❤️💯
Y'all i was laughing when she told the nurse to stfu and started crying when i saw the baby. HE'S NOT EVEN MY BABY AND I CRIED. He looks so precious. The way he was wiggling around trying to look at her brooooo

Girl my story is a mess. I didn’t even know I was pregnant. I woke up January 12th feeling like I pissed my pants, I went to work and told my manager I had to leave cause I was uncontrollably peeing on myself, so long story short later that night I saw blood so I scheduled an appointment for a papsmear thinking it was an ovarian cyst because my mom passed of reproductive issues this lady told me I was 9 months pregnant! Girl 3 days later on the 16th I gave birth to a baby girl I had to hurry up and think of a name and everything lol they didn’t give me an epidural or nothing worse pain ever from the contractions to the burning pain,ripping and tearing plus the stitches but I love that little girl and my life is so much more exciting! Congrats to you sister from me and Raidyn Sindel Rain (I’m a mortal kombat fan lol )
Your baby is an Aquarius
She the first woman to be out here enjoying labour😂😭making jokes and all
Everybody: this made me not wanna have a baby  Me: ok so one more wouldn't kill me 😩.... That first time holding them is EVERYTHING. Its so beautiful

AHHHH FINALLY CANT WAIT TO SEE HIS HAIR WHAT HE MAKE/HIS OWN MEME😂😂😂...I wanted to cry when u were screaming 🥺 your amazing Nicole....the part u told them to be quite was funny the nurses understand tho
she looking cute going to the hospital lol. I know if it was me I'm going in a oversized t-shirt and some crocs.
Did anyone know..that she was pregnant? Why did I never know about this?
Most women give birth within the 40 week time span. Over 40 you need to see your obg or the hospital. When your water brakes that usually means the baby is ready to come out. When my gf was pregnant her water broke and with in 3 hours after the baby was born
16:35  When she said shut the **** up that was the funniest thing on earth😂 but you did it girl got it over with❤
He is soooo cute and love you❤️❤️

I must say I shed some tears cause it's so overwhelming for me since I lost my baby 5 weeks ago to early labour, my baby was 5 months already but his lungs weren't ready yet...Iv got 3 other kids and they comfort me and take away the pain. So watching this video just triggered some emotions😢Thank you for letting us be a part of your journey. Congratulations again!!!! 🎉🙏

She had every right to tell them to shut the fuck up. There were like 5 people crowding her all talking in her face I would have done the same. And tbh that nurse looked like she had a bit of an attitude afterwards. I would have let her excuse herself from my birthing room. 🧘🏻‍♀️
Omg he is soooooo handsome 😍😍😍💞💞💞👶🏽👶🏽👑👑👑
our queen is a mother 🥺
My whole heart 🥺😭😭💓
Congrats💗
Nicole after giving birth: “bitch I’m a motha! No drama!”

Im with you on the recording thing. I hate that :/  But the Nurse tlkn bought all that Oxygen (with a mask on??) or Carbon dioxide.... Congrats on the birth and for going all natural.  did it 3 times and the pain gets worst. I have high pain tolerance too but got that drug the last child too tho they didn't tell me it was like taking a shot I had no idea i'm 25 and never drunk alcohol I guess that explains why I kept coming in and out of reality. You did pretty good had a great intelectual conversation and everything.  I'm Sure some ppl needed to hear that ♥

“I CANT CALM DOWN STFU” is a mood😭
what's the point of getting him circumcised?  genuinely asking
congrats your a mommy now woohoo healthy birth! 🥳
Girl. Had you made it last 6 without pain meds, you’d not have said they feel like period cramps. Period cramps are like the very beginning stages of labor 😂 I’ve had three kids vaginally, without ANY medication and it is NOT like period cramps. I’d rather get hit by a semi, but I love it!
I have never heard anybody have a baby a scream that loud but I had to remember how young she was and it was hard to take the pain .💕💕💕💕💕💕💕✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾🤛🏾
I love how this was posted on my birthday.
that baby came out wit soo much hair
She's really loved

I screamed loud too! To preface, my epidural failed with my second. Way before I got it, as we were walking into the L&D ward, we could hear a mom screaming bloody murder. I thought, "Bless her heart, she didn't get an epidural". Well, five hours later that was me! LOL! But my doctor looked at me in the face and said, "Momma, you CAN do this! C'mon, let's dig deep!" It was the refocus I needed to pull through. Shortly after that, he was born! Congratulations!

The cutest baby in the world 😍😍😍😍
How are you this funny giving birth 😂
I'm happy for you both, he's so sweet😍❤ Glad you had a safe delivery🙌🙌
If you ever have another child have it at a birthing center. It was insulting to me when they laughed when you asked for gas because that’s one of the #1 things places use to easy the pain and not be medicated at the same time. Birthing center allow you to walk, move, and even  light candles if you want, almost whatever you want. It’s criminal to me they make woman LAY DOWN to push a whole human out of them. Try taking a huge shit laying down.
Wow I cried ....so beautiful ❤️
This was just beautiful
Such an amazing experience, you did well! Took me back to when I had mine (2)! He’s handsome and the both of you should be proud ! I hope you are able to nurse him and give him the necessary nutrients over the formula! God bless and I wish you both the best with parenthood 🥰🙌🏽🤩

Girl you’re hilarious and special. I’ve been watching your pregnancy videos for a while and it’s crazy how just this January I found out that I’m pregnant. And the worst part is my partner been stressing me out putting me under so much depression and draining my energy to the point I barely eat; I now eat once a day and sometimes I got to force it. Thinking so hard if I should abort it or not but I’ve prayed and waiting on God..by next week I should know what to do. However, thank you for what you said in the video and sharing your experience with us. Love you and congratulations 🎉🎊
“i feel like i’m doo doo-in” IM 😂✋🏼
Praying with you all,so glad to meet lil daddy!! Congratulations!

WAIT HOLD UP FEBRUARY 1ST IS MY BDAY DATE NOOO WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I witnessed my sister give birth when I was younger and been scared since lol now seeing this video and hearing her scream...at 26 I’m even more scared haha!
My Mom had her baby boy on January 20th and i was certain that you would have him before my mom but no and come to think about it both of the babies are hella fucking handsome and cute but my Mama baby he mean but I love him and this little baby here broo y'all did y'all job because he is sooooo precious ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Girl when you was screaming and told someone to stfu, I hollered and had to rewatch that part 10xs. I was looking like 😵😳😲 you're too funny...then after birth you talking to those nurses like that shit never happen...😆🤣😭😫😫 congratulations and YES HEIS DEFINITELY HIS DADDY'S TWIN. I LOVED THE SOUND OF HIM TRYING TO TALK WHEN HE WAS GETTING A BATH.

I laughed the entire time. Whew I just had my baby in October. So everything that was going on was hilarious 😂 congratulations 🥳

So sweet. Blessings to you both ! 🤎🤎🤎
He kept lifting up because its instincts called the Breast Crawl newborns laying on their mom can smell the milk and will rock and lift until they make their way to the breast to eat
When I heard her scream......Why the fuck I’m a girl 😭😭😭 Congrats tho ♥️
Hope you see this comment, as it really does come from a very genuine place in my heart. First of all, thank you so much for sharing you guys’ special day with us. Makes me feel like part of the fam!! Messiah is a very beautiful baby boy, you guys made the best looking newborn I’ve seen since I gave birth to my son 21 yrs ago 😃 May God bless your new family of 3, praying y’all stay together forever & I wish you guys much prosperity for the rest of your lives!!!

I was born at 12:10 pm . I wondered what’s his birth time gone be
This is the best labor and delivery video! Messiah is the cutest lil baby!  Him lying there on your chest really made me flashback to my having 1stborn! It actually was a better experience being single because when I had my lil one, I was married and there were too many people around. I needed support,  but, it was very hard to concentrate.  It was hilarious when you said, "SHUT THE FUCK UP!"
Not the “I can’t calm down stfu” 😭😭😭
How old is she?
Congratulations Mama Messiah
I love you. Congratulations baby.
I been watching you since the ponytails vids now you having your first child 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾 my eyes are leaking!!! I'm so proud of y'all🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾 more success to come😌😌😌😌

Awww
Children are not fashion accessories, Messiah really? Kid will be bullied and made fun of for that name for the rest of their life. It should be illegal. I'm not a troll, I'm not angry, I just saw this video on trending and had to be a logical voice among the stupidity.  Its not too late to give your kid a real name that deserves respect.
I can’t control how cute he is
Did it hurt?       I’m kidding 😂
Congratulations on my nephew, he so handsome...
The scream was funny
“Is this the drugs talking?” Bruh I can’t ✋😭😂

I don’t wanna sound negative because I did it too. I’m just surprised they allowed Malachi to sleep with the baby like that. Then nurses was taking my kids from me while I was sleep. I’d wake up to them moving them out my arms lol but I understood. A nurse told me a grandma came to visit and fell asleep holding the baby. Baby rolled out of her arms and hit the floor. Baby didn’t make it
Can you tell us how you hid the camera cause sis tryna do the same 😂😎

Congratulation kayla❤️💋🙇🏽‍♀️
u are a strong woman... congrats
CONGRATSSS OMFG HE IS SO CUTE🥺🥺
Ugh sakitaaaaa
Congratulations
I don’t understand how her telling the nurses to stfu is funny. I have 3 kids and they weighed from 6-10 pounds at birth. It was extremely painful and I was super irritated, but while I pushed the nurses tried their best to comfort me. They are doing the same thing here. Why would I yell at them at all? I think it’s so immature for people to think it was funny  ESPECIALLY considering the intense and depressing things health care workers have been enduring. I sincerely hope she apologized afterwards because that was cruel. And please don’t comment “ohh she paid them so she can treat them however she wants” because who cares about money, treat people with respect. I’ve seen plenty of people give plenty natural births because I’ve studied to be a midwife and I haven’t seen any of those women be disrespectful to the nurses. So please don’t use her giving natural birth as an excuse.
Beautiful son wishing him a life filled with love,success health and wealth
Congratulations 🎊🎉 this baby 👶 blessings

Congrats and him sooo handsome
I jus saw this on tik tok and was like hold up😶 im so happy wtf
All I can say is I’m 5 months pregnant and I’m alone in this 🤦🏽‍♀️ I was with him for 7 years but he decided that he didn’t want this anymore and left me knowing I have complications with my pregnancy. So no it wasn’t the drugs talking that moment really hit home because this isn’t easy and you do need support regardless . But thank you for bringing that to the light because I felt exactly where you were coming from and it’s not talked about enough. 💯❤️❤️❤️
Congratulations to the both of you! God bless!

Congratulations 🎊🎉🍾
Nurse:Calm down Nicole:I CAN'T CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!!!!!!!!
😭😭😭💕💕💕💞💞
“I can’t calm down STFU !!” Wheww baby I felt that 🤣
She was so calm until it was time to push
🙌🏽🙏🏽 Congratulations Nicole & Malachi on the birth of your beautiful baby boy, Messiah! You handled your labor and delivery very well, Nicole 🤰🏽👍🏽... Things are way more advanced than when I gave birth. I wasn't given an epidural (or any alternative pain reliever) because they didn't administer spinals after 4 cm of dilation -- back then. That's why my adult child is an "only child" because I felt every single one of my contractions... Your screams were very relatable; but they were followed by one of the most beautiful moments of your life -- holding Messiah for the very first time 🤱🏽. You'll never forget it... Congratulations again, Nicole & Malachi! 👶🏾🍼🎉🎊
Love kaylas vibe she was acting up during this whole video like she wasn’t in pain... god bless you an ur bundle of joy...
Nurse: (ok calm down) Kayla: (I CANT CALM DOWN SHUT THE F$@K UP)
Give me the epidural for 200 please 🥺
Its the part when she said ' the poop felt amazing' lmaooooooo
Did she tell the nurse to stfu? 😂 congratulations on your beautiful boy 💜
I had baby fever but now I’m reconsidering 🤣
This made me so happy. And I'm proud how she kept her reactions real and not hiding it. Proud of u!
You did that my son name is Messiah to  is mean child of God ...gods gift

Welcome to the new guest 😘😘😘👨 👩 👦
I’m sorry but when you started yelling I started dying.
This is the cutest vlog I have seen for the longest 🥰
Me and my boyfriend always talk about when we get a little older how we want to have our first baby and I’ve always been nervous thinking about the actual process of having a baby and going through it during the birthing but watching you and maliky (sorry it I spelled that wrong) makes me feel confident and watching him be there by your side through everything and not just the actual birth gives me the confidence that I know me and my partner can do this when it’s the right time and that as long as we stick together we can get through anything just like y’all. You guys are so inspiring
Congratulations on your beautiful baby
Congrats boo 😘
Him so handsome 🥰😍
OMG congratulations and thank you for allowing us to be there this was the funniest labor video so you had me cracking up until the delivery but still he is so beautiful and I can't wait to go to this journey with you

Im so happy fro you nicole😙😙😙😙😙😙 lot of love from Jamaica😙
Nicole, God is real and so is Lord Jesus Christ, as much as people don't want to believe, a day will come where their sins will find them or their sins will be forgiven at the cross. There is no middle ground.  Repent of your evil ways, and Trust in Jesus as your Lord and Savior, who is a merciful God. Jesus is love and justice. By Faith trust in Jesus Christ, the only way to salvation.

I also have back problems. I had it before I got pregnant and still have it I think more now that I am pregnant. My aunt told me for some people who already have back problems and they get the epidural it might make your back worse... But that's a chance I might just have to take... But really I pray it don't make my back worse. Because imma need that lol, I'm really just scared to see how long tht needle really is😬.
Messiah is gonna have the funniest mom ever
She literally about to give birth but she worried about her hair😭😭😂😂she like.....”I gotta look presentable”🤣🤣🤣
You Funny As Hell 🤣 I Love It
he soo cuteeeeeee 😫😍😍😍😍😍😍
Everybody that ik who has gotten epidural complain about back pain later after. So nah, i want to push mines out naturally ❤️🥰 i feel its the best / safest way. That epidural will have you hurting for life, while a baby is just for a few moments ❤️ can’t wait to meet mines. Currently 7 weeks (1st time mommy)!!!! Congratulations Nicoleeeeee

Congratulations 🎉🎉
The pain is definitely worth it especially if you’re like me and couldn’t get pregnant. I didn’t do an epidural because it drugs the baby plus everyone I know that got it has back issues from it. But it was a great experience overall, I lucked up as a first time mom and was in labor for 5 hours before pushing.
Omgg
Omg i cried🤩🤩🤩 how is he so cute ?!
Nobody: Absolutely Nobody:  Kayla: is these the drugs talking 😭😭 .
Where the family channel

Aren't they supposed to give them an enema prior to delivery? They gave my mother an enema before she delivered me; this was back in 1993. Perhaps things are different now?

That's an intelligent baby, he intends to do his movements very early 😍😍😍 I guess he was making his own plans whilst in his mama's womb😄😄😄😄❤❤❤
Mah gah so sweet
Bruh that screaming has made me petrified to give birth now. I'm gonna get an epidural 💀
💕💕💕💕
❤️❤️❤️❤️ he’s perfect!!!!
This is hands down the best delivery video out there! 😂❤️
Dont feel bad Nicole, cause I yelled STFU too. It Hurts like hell.  Folks telling you to push, and your mind is raising cause it Hurts!!!!  I had a natural birth no meds. I was upset cause it seemed like everyone was having their baby that night. So I  couldn't get anything for the pain. I apologize afterwards,  given birth is very very painful and beautiful. Congratulations  to the both of you, he is gorgeous!!!
I am so happy for you congratulation sis ur family is beautiful
Okay I am saying this very objectively : usually babies look like old potatoes when they’re newborns but damn he is BEAUTIFUL
When Messiah was sleeping with Malachi❤❤
Chilllllll his name is Messiah?!😐 that just doesn’t sit right with me
How many pounds is he, he a big boy?
Nicole well done beautiful ☺️ You’ve bought a beautiful young boy on this earth that’s going to succeed and prosper in this life🥳 You and Malachi are going to be great parents ❤️ We thank god you both are healthy and okay and are ready to conquer whatever faces you 🥰 Welcome to the world Messiah 🥳😘
Finally. I felt like you were gonna stay pregnant forever. So happy for you! I'm sure it feels good to get that baby out and love on them ❤
He’s beautiful Kayla!! Thank you for sharing this with everyone. I cried sooo hard 😭
I am 34 weeks and super nervous about giving birth. This video has actually thought me a lot. Thanks for posting and good luck with your sweet baby boy ❤️.
Congratulations on your baby boy, he is precious.
She a mess even during labor and delivery🤣😂. I am glad to see her in such a positive place and good spirits when most of us was a hot mess when we was going through it😩😖. Far as the epidural, it is a chance that something can happen but thank God I was able to do it and came out ok. You do whatever gets you through and keeps baby out of distress. Congrats on you guys' beautiful baby boy! 🎈🎉🎊💙
Yall actin like she intended to be rude...she just carried a human being in her body for 10 months and pushed it out I think she can have a pass.  Edit: For everyone arguing that I made a mistake in saying 9 months instead of 10...she says 10 in the video. An average pregnancy can be from 39-42 weeks! My comment wasn't even about that anyways...
That bigass house with no furniture in it damn
CONGRATS!!!!
Omg😭😭😭😭im afraid pregant is not easy
I can’t wait to push a baby out one day and cuss all over the birth room
He is the first new born baby I've seen that is actually not cute and doesn't look like a old raisin
I want a baby!! 😍
he so beautiful, omggg congratulations  on your baby boy😭🤎‼️😍
Congratulations on ur new addition to  you & ur hubby.  God bless ur new family in the name of Jesus Christ.  You guys are going to be very good and responsible parents. Keep loving each, communicating with each other and keep ur family together.  Ur hubby is a Gem of a man, he's shown a lot of men out there how to be loving & caring & responsible. God bless you continuously.
I love you too so sweet

Why messiah
I feel like when woman do natural labor our babies come out smart asf my daughter had the doctors in disbelief
😂🤝❤️
Everything she experienced was the same for me. I wanted everyone to SHUT THE HELL UP. My mom was playing religious music and I was out of my mind with that pain and told her that was the spookiest sound I every heard and to turn it off. I aware if your not a mom that experience labor and child birth then shut up.
Congratulations Nicole! Remember, even when you are tired and seem overwhelmed, there is nothing wrong with stepping back and taking time for yourself.
He so cuteeeee awwww😭❤️

Yall TRUST me nurses are used to panicked pregnant ladies who have a dilated vag and a whole ass baby coming out of them, yelling at them to shut up and being scared. ESPECIALLY young mamas
I told the person that was piercing my lip I hated them😭😭 cause that shit HURT congratulations kayyyyy😍🥰❤️❤️
Look at that baby,What an angel, so beautiful, so precious. Congrats Nicole ♥️♥️
I ended up not getting my son clipped. I was going to but last minute I said no. I just couldn't let them hurt him.lol. he's 1 now and all that b's about clipped being better is all cosmetic or religious reasons. I asked the weenie clipper lady. As long as it's kept clean it don't matter regardless. He want it done he can choose to do it anytime. Idk why ppl push that one way or the other on ppl. It's YOUR kid. You do what YOU think is best for your super adorable baby ☺
Congrats Nicole, im so happy for you!!

When I was a little kid my mother told me that the reason why I have a dent on the side of my head like a little one is because well she thinks that when they’re beating me and cleaning me up when I was a newborn they accidentally put their finger in my head on accident and that was the reason but we’re not sure who all
Her scream was advanced lol

I know it's so hard not to yell when you are pushing, but it actually makes pushing harder  ecause you are releasing air instead of using that air to push down. (I'm a certified doula)

ive never seen this channel in my life i just got it randomly in my recommendations but lets just say i am here for it
Omg I love him!!!! Seems like he was just as ready to meet you guys!!!💕💕💕💕💕🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🤗🤗🤗🤗
I wasn’t going to comment but when you said to the moms doing it by theirselves I had to tell my story 😭💔 I have two girls already 3 years old and 1 year old and pregnant again I didn’t plan to get pregnant but I did and I take full responsibility so I don’t care what anyone says I love my kids so much and they know that. Their dad has always been with me giving birth and this time around he won’t be because his incarcerated due to violations and that was 2 years ago so now he has to deal with consequences  I’m so scared so worried especially because COVID I think about it everyday how I won’t have him by my side. I think who will my kids be with when I go give birth and who will they stay with for 2 days. I cry about it every night I don’t even know which family member I want their because they don’t even really help and understand the pain I’m honestly just so worried and sad 💔😭 I thank God you had a safe, health, delivery and a amazing husband ❤️ God bless you guys

Malachi is such a supportive partner. Messiah Kaylon Ni ‘Colby is such a beautiful name. He looks so cute. His hair is beautiful. Malachi and Messiah look like twins in their baby photos
HE WAS BORN ON MY BIRTHDAY 🤯🤯☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
he is the cutest baby everrr mashallah (god bless him) Nicole how your baby got more hair than you coming out the womb😭
if you haven’t heard an good news in a while here you go!⬇️  In the very beginning of time God created all & it was good, His plan was to have Him & His creation(humans) live in utopia. the satan deceived God’s creation so that wouldn’t happen, we choose evil. Evil has its consequences, death is the consequence for disobeying an everlasting God. God doesn’t want that for any of His creation so He sent His Son Jesus(God in the flesh) & Jesus lived the perfect life. Died the death as a criminal, & resurrected, all so that we could have eternal life if we have faith in that sacrifice.      Have an amazing life!😁

Your screams was scary af 😢 glad y’all okay
She was pregnant?!?! Oh guess so
What a beautiful baby ♥️
She was mad 😭😭😭
Where I'm from, when we're in labor we're not allowed to go to the bathroom cause the nurses will say "Do you want the baby to come out in the toilet?" We do not have medications to ease the pain either, no epidurals, nothing. We can't even scream too loud cause they'll be like "you put yourself here, you gotta bear it." I be so jealous tbh😔😔
Ooo he so cute, congratulations 🎉 them belly moves got him active early 🥺😍
when the doctor was cleaning the baby she was going hard on his head he a newborn she needa be careful with my favorite youtuber baby bc ima get med if he get hurt

Just seeing the happiness in her during all this really makes me cry and want this type of love in my life. I got so emotional seeing the precious moment she had with her son immediately after the birth cuz it reminded me of an article saying babies believe their mother is physically apart of them. The love is so pure and you can clearly see it in that moment. I can’t wait to feel this type of unconditional love ❤️ Congratulations Nicole on the birth and how far you have come in life! May many more blessings come your way! ❤️

I feel you babes, when I gave birth to my youngest daughter in August (had a Csection was there for dayyys) I kept asking when I could go home 🤣 the nurses was like why you wanna go home? BECAUSE I WANNA BE WITH MY BABY IN PEACE, DA FUCK?! Lol.
*baby trying to get the hell out*  Where's my lip gloss?
"I CAN'T CALM DOWN, STFU!" and to think i was deciding my baby's name today at the age of 13 when god knows how many years before i even get pregnant. lmfao im considering adopting in the future now, but then again, i want a child of my own blood so uh, i'll go with the pain when i get older, :,)

How do you tell a woman that's IN A WHOLE LOT OF PAIN, PUSHING OUT A BABY TO CONTROL HERSELF? She has every right to scream and do whatever she can to deal with that pain. What I wanted to say to those COWS (nurses/doctor) is "YOU DECIDED TO BECOME A NURSE/DOCTOR THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH". Don't be insensitive or lack compassion for people that are going through something you're not going through.
Omgggggg
🥰🥰🥰🥰
Beautiful 😭😍💕
That baby is the cutest baby I ever seen❤️❤️❤️❤️😩
It’s amazing what women bodies can endure 🥰, “I can’t calm down STFU” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
She weighs as much as me😭😭 I’m 13
The way she is just so calm when her water broke💀
Lmao the screaming calm the fuck down shut the fuck up part 😂😂😂😂

The baby was happy to be here! 😍 Look at him with that big smile!
Baby camed out looking so cute!!!congratulations!!!
only labor n delivery i have cried in fr😭😩
I was mad that they was all screaming at her to calm down. I would have yelled stfu too bc all that screaming while im tryna concentrate is going to make it worse. I have anxiety and people screaming loud and repeating “CaLM dOwN!!” thinking that’s going help and it doesn’t. But that baby is beautiful 😍🙏🏽 congratulations love ❤️
First words he fo sure heard were " SHUT THE F- UP!!!! "
He came out Smiling and ready to talk 😩❤️😍😍😍
Awwww.. I love them 2gether
Sweet!😍❤ Congratulations on both of you❤❤
Awwww I almost cried sooo cute when he lifted his head and cooed a little bit 😩😩😩 congratulations and I love the relationship you have with your sons father. also I did it alone so I appreciated that one part of the video when you were talking about your journey etc

Nbs she not wrong telling  them to stfu. It's hard to get your thoughts together when all them people is talking at once and all you trying to do is deliver your child safely she needed silence and calm energy.  Which the nurses did not deliver she did amazinggg. Better than I. Because I'm not brave enough to go without epidural nbs
Congrats!

You are so wise beyond your years and made some great points. I knew what you meant when you were on the narcotic. You were saying that the experience of motherhood is so precious and to not waste it on an individual(partner) you have to worry about or wonder if they truly care for you. That is key. That advice can save a lot of people. Congratulations on your new baby ! God bless your little family Kay 🤎

Ooommmggg!!!!!!!!!!!!!💀💀💀💀
😂😂😂😭😭😭
Congratulations!!! 🎉
to everyone in the comments who haven’t had a child yet .... if your thinking about getting an epidural just know ... they make you wait until yours about 6-7 centimeters to give it to you so you will be feeling them contraction pains ... and the worst part about the natural is the contractions but what i can say is the ring of fire which isn’t that bad it literally burns for a quick second ( when the baby head pass which is only for a second ) and then the shoulders just slide out after no pain fr but afterwards i was up walking around showering and more to where as i got the epidural i was in the damn bed almost an hour before the allowed me to get up and my back hurt so bad in cold weather ... so trust me NATURAL IS BETTER ( obviously if you can’t then get the baby out the safest way possible it doesn’t make you less of a mom because you had a c section YOU ARE STILL A GOOD ASS MOTHER )
20:54 those pics look like they from the 1970s
كل العرب يحطو لايك اثبات وجود هههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههه

The Gospels repeatedly declare that JESUS IS THE MESSIAH —the One chosen by God and anointed by Him to save His people from their sins (Matthew 16:16; Luke 4:17-21; John 1:40-49; 4:25, 26). After Jesus’ resurrection, the apostle Peter reminded those listening to him “how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him. And we,” Peter said, “are witnesses of all things which He did” (Acts 10:38, 39).  Jesus Himself claimed to be the promised Messiah. When He talked with a woman at a well in Samaria, she said, “ ‘I know that Messiah is coming’ (who is called Christ). ‘When He comes, He will tell us all things.’ Jesus said to her, ‘I who speak to you am He’ ” (John 4:25, 26).  Today, Jesus is still the Messiah—God’s chosen, anointed One who came to deliver us from sin and Satan. As the Messiah, He offers you forgiveness for your sins. He promises you salvation and a place in His coming kingdom. “Come to Me,” He urges, “. . . and you will find rest for your souls” (Matthew 11:28, 29  ALL MUST REPENT NOW AND TURN TO JESUS CHRIST BEFORE IT IS ETERNALLY TOO LATE.. 🙏🙏🙏🙏
I'm so happy for you friend!!!! Congratulations!!!!

“we shouldn’t have sex” LMFAOOOOO I CANT
They gave you the drug thats why you poppin it back 😅😅😅
Believe in JESUS, we are all sinners deserving the wrath of GOD, because we sin against a holy and just and perfect GOD. Therefore we all deserve the punishment hell, but GOD in his rich grace and mercy by which he loved us sent JESUS to die  for us on the cross to leave  his throne and suffer for us. To  be the perfect  sacrifice for us because he  himself was sinless and perfect. That if we would have a repentant heart and believe in JESUS and place our faith in him,we will be saved from the eternal punishment and be given eternal life.
Your going to be a great mother

i’m so happy for you ☺️♥️
Congratulations! 🎉 😭 this entire process was exactly like mine! Every bit of it! Omg! ❤️ Beautiful baby!

Now I said I don’t want another one🥺🥺let me get off this video 🏃🏾‍♀️  #hesperfect💙💙
i smiled through the whole video. congratulations i’m so happy for you 💗🤍
Baby Messiah already got the best mom and dad. I'm crying 😭

Who else was dying  when she told the nurse to shut the F up
Damn the pain women's go through while giving birth.. You're more stronger than a Man.. Not even the strongest man on planet could bear the pain.. respect to all women's out there...   And yes, you need to cut your nails, you might hurt the baby unknowingly.. Just my opinion though.  And congrats for your healthy baby boy.
Congratulations!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️

I can tell that he was a very hopeful baby because he was smiling! Babies usually cry! That baby is going to make your lives great even in the greatest hardships. You already United emotionally but the baby is the physical union of your love and is precious. I ain’t seen no mother say that I regret holding this baby for nine months. Imagine the catastrophe that could’ve occurred if she swallowed.

Congrations Messiah is so cute 🤗 but very careful with those nails so that doesn't scratch the baby advice from mumm of 4 please don't get me wrong don't find it offensive all the best wishes with you guys
IF YOU SEE THIS MESSAGE PLEASE PLEASE SUBSCRIBE 🙏 PLEASE I'M BEGGING YOU
My name is messiah so cute ❤️❤️
Congratulations 💚
😂them screamssss
Congrats ur gonna be the best momma
they are such a beautiful couple ❤️  so happy you had a safe delivery kayla
She said AmAzInG like period gurl. Look at u a mama now
Congratulations!!! Ahhhh cant waitttt to see him at home 😻
Yaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyy 💚💚💚 Congrats, so many congrats!! You guys are going to do so fucking well. 🌻 Get some sleep while baby is asleep even if you want to get things done, GET THAT SLEEP! I promise y’all are gonna regret not getting sleep.  And if you ever feel like you need help, ASK!! Don’t feel ashamed for needing help with messiah. It’s all new to the both of you and getting all the help/support you need is always great. ❣️ I had to do the entire pregnancy alone, and my sons first year and a half all on my own.   It’s hard but we single moms got it, it comes with a lot of emotional pain but it makes us stronger so I appreciate you mentioning us single mommas, we need the words of comfort from time to time. ❣️  Btw, I got epidural and one of the nurses were like “I need you to prop your legs up.” I said “BITCH I CANT FEEL MY LEGS WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO??????”. All us mommas have had that moment where we cussed out the nurse, it’s normal lmao. 🤷🏽‍♀️😂💚
“This not that WAP this that DROP” 😭 irritating
“I CAN’T CALM DOWN SHUT THE F*CK UP!!!” 😭😭😭😂 i hollered 😂🤣🤣
Congratulations hun welcome to motherhood!! Btw my son’s name is Messiah as well spelled the exact same way except he’s 1 and a half.
Congratulations girllll

I’m cracking up at the point where your screaming I was 9cm dilated and didn’t know he was coming until I felt like pushing and my water didn’t break they gave me medicine to amp up the contractions I sent everybody to hell in that delivery room I ripped off my IV and told the nurses to leave me tf alone and don’t touch me ... my baby was out in 30 mins 😂🥰 congratulations giving birth with no epidural is no joke I wish people would respect mothers more!!
Why did I just hear something or it’s just my ears did she’ll just say we shouldn’t had sex

Hes so cute
The drip tho🥶😌
When daddy and bady were sleeping together I wanted to cry it was so cute awwww
Congratulations!! He’s beautiful 🎉🎁🎂
🇯🇲🇨🇦Congrats girl! ❤😀👍You were positive all the way through. I wish you and your new family all the best.  THIS BABY DOES NOT CRY WHICH MEANS HE NOT GOING TO BE A PROBLEM CHILD NOR A PROBLEM TEENAGER. HE IS GOING TO MAKE YOU HAPPY AND PROUD. IT IS PROVEN THAT OF THE MOTHER IS STRESSED AND ALWAYS IN BAD MOOD DURING HER PREGNANCY THEN THEYRE IS A HIGH CHANCE THAT THE BABY WILL COME OUT REFLECTING THAT CHARACTER. I ALSO NOTICED THAT THIS BABY SMILING AND ALREADY HOLDING UP HIS HEAD, HE IS very determined and you can tell he is going to be a independent smart ambitious child.  He is born in the year of the OX (represent prosperity and hardwork) and he is an Aquarian (visionary)   Note: TO ALL PREGNANT WOMEN OUT THERE THE BEST And least painful Qay to give BIRTH IS IN WATER AND KNEELING DOWN OR SITTING IN AND OPEN SIT CHAIR. GIVING BIRTH IS LKEL TAKING A POO; DO U TAKE A POO LAYING DOWN?
Sis was singing instead of screaming
I’m sooooo happy for you!!!!! Congratulations!!!
Félicitations Dieu merci everything went well 🙏🏾😍
Omgggg 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Imagine dating her and u walking around the house and she randomly does that funny face

Omg😭😭😭I felt it when Kayla crying congrats to uu both❤🙏
Congratulations he’s beautiful!!
I felt that “I can’t calm down, stfu” a little too much.  Edit: since my comment seems to be taken out of context, just to clarify,  I’m quite aware that having a baby is by no means a small feat and that I resonated with her saying that.
The way she layed back on that bed when the nurse came in was priceless 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I think he'll have his mom's eyes😍
Plz tell me YALL have seen the tiktok of her yelling at the nurses😂
Congrats mama!!

I had my baby boy in July and must I say it was painful but I DID get the epidural because I could not handle the contractions , and I was so nervous because u don’t know what to expect when it’s ur first time giving birth and in the room next me I could hear this woman screaming 😳 from giving birth and it made me even more scared & nurse , hearing Nicole’s screams triggered me 😳😩🤣 right now . I didn’t scream but that’s because the epidural helped me so much 😩🙏🏼🥺

why is the baby sa calm tho-
16:45 “SHUT THE FUCK UP” I SWEAR TO GOD THIS GON BE ME 😭✋🏽✋🏽
Aww! He so so cute🥰🥰 a very big congratulations 💕
Honestly I do think it's very important for young girls to know that you don't need to just choose ANY man to have a child with. Having a child is only slightly easy when you have a husband. But when you're doing it alone. That's some pain and trauma. Don't give these men your bodies when they don't deserve it!!!!
Congratulation❤️
Wow what a beautiful boy!! Looks just like his daddy. You’re experience made me so excited for my birth in April god willing! It’s my third baby so I’m not scared at all, I really enjoyed both of my births, the pain, all of it! Getting to see your baby for the first time, nothing beats that! Congratulations to you both! ❤️
💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
Girl you awesome
Still funny I love it😂💯
She said stfuu
He is gorgeous 😍
Doctors: push down push down   Kayla:I CANT PUSH DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP
Lmao !!!!! She told them to shut the fu$% up !!!!!!
YOU TELLING THAT NURSE TO STFU IS BAD GAL GEMINI ENERGY    but also congrats mama!! wishing you both good health & a safe recovery 💖
HEAD FULL OF HAIR 🤧💟💟🌹
I’m crying in the club rn!! This was beautiful! Happy for y’all sis✨🤎 the baby look like Kai😭😭😭

He is beautiful.  Congratulations
Awww he's soooo adorable!!!
I love this a lot y’all are going to be great parents💙💯 I love how ur so calm about all of  this🥰💯
I'm genuinely really curious and no judgement what so ever. I'm a Mum of 2 girls so anything to do with little boys I have next to no experience. What are the benefits of getting bub circumcised? Do alot of parents choose that option when they have sons? Is it something your midwife/doctor discusses with you during your pregnancy?  Like I said, no judgement at all, I'm just curious and also it's good to have some idea about these kind of things incase I have a boy in the future.
Congratulations 🎈🎊🎉 I pray for God richest blessings, abundance of love, peace, and protection over your entire family especially your precious baby boy
Congratulations 🤗 he's so handsome 🥰
Aww I cried watching this is so beautiful 😍😍😍😍😍

Congrats loves! Welcome to parenthood! Our nephew is too precious. 😍  Be careful boo, 1 baby turns into 2, 3, maybe even 4 reallllll quick. 😂    Your first poop felt good? How? I damn near died on that toilet. I was crying and holding on to the pole next to the toilet. I pulled that string for help and told them to get the fuxk out when they came in to help me. 😂 I was stitched from front to back, left to right honey. Felt like a blowtorch was down there hell. 😖😂    Congrats again to both of you. Enjoy that precious baby. They grow so fast. Rest and take it easy so you can heal properly.  Love and blessings! ❤

I've never heard of doctors giving the mother fentynal (sp) while in labor. Also, it's natural to hold your breath when in pain, but my dumb doctor didn't tell me not to do that so by the time they checked on baby they said my baby had low oxygen 🙄 ANYWAYS, congrats on your handsome baby boy ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Messiah and his dad look just alike awwww❤️❤️🥰
Yooo when she said fuck you I lost it💀😭🤚🏼
congratulations! he is such a beautiful baby. i wish you all happy and healthy lives. you did a great job bringing him into the world. good work now take a nice rest and enjoy it. he will grow so so fast and before you know it he will be an adult. again congratulations✨❤️

Ohhh god he is so cute. I got sooo emotional
Congratulations Nicole. ✨ You are truly blessed with a beautiful healthy baby boy and a kind compassionate man who is fully involved through every moment of your pregnancy. I shed a tear at the part where you said you don't make a baby alone. I just had a baby boy on December 25 2020 and I went through the entire pregnancy and labor alone. I had to be strong for me and my unborn child no matter what tho. I really cried once Messiah was here and that moment of bonding time you guys had was so special. You are so blessed. I've been watching your content for years and I love you and what you do. just wanna say I wish you nothing but more blessings to come. ♥️   (Sorry for the long comment this is way I don't comment 😂)
He said you was gonna need able sleep after the baby. Lol new parents. What is sleep. Daddy shifts so you can sleep. I been checking my YouTube everyday for this. He is beautiful.  You did a great job!!! Sending love from Bama. He already turning his head. Never seen that before wow. Already. I always heard kids do things fast to get ready for new baby. Maybe be girl soon.

CONGRATULATIONS 🎈
That part about the hospital asking if she’s SURE her water broke??. Medical discrimination and micro aggressions still prevalent regardless if she’s a well established and known influencer/artist. All they still see is a black woman that they ~assume~ is somehow exaggerating or unaware of her own body. Shits so irritating. Regardless, Thank you for sharing this part of your journey and congratulations💙
OMG CONGRATULATIONS!!!

The way he was trying to look up to see his mother was the most adorable moment.  The way she said “aaaahhhhh” during the contractions and went straight back to scrolling on her phone was hilarious. The way her screams got louder and louder when the contractions started hitting different and the way she cursed out the nurses took the cake.

The way she snapped at that nurse
With my first baby my water broke at like 6 am but everyone was asleep so I just stayed up and I tried to call my mom and my grandma but nobody answered so I just waited until my friend's mom got home and it was like 12 pm and she walked in I told her my water broke this morning she started freaking out asking why didn't I tell anyone and I said bcuz they were all sleeping and she said  go wake them the hell up 🤣 then I told her I'm hungry so I went to eat and finally went to the hospital at 2 pm and  basically the nurses were mad at me. But I was in labor for 23 hours and ended up having to have an emergency c section bcuz my baby couldn't come out.   My contractions didn't hurt me at all bcuz my period cramps are wayyyy worse .  I'm so happy for you guys omg having such a beautiful family and doing so well 💗💗💗
who else went straight to her video once it posted!!
Congratulations 💙
HE IS ADORABLE OMG 🥺💙

Sis told them stfu😂😂 but the cutest baby EVERY😍😍
So I’m watching this video crying and laughing and my boyfriend said he doesn’t think it was that serious for her to scream like that . I’ve never had a child before so I don’t know what it’s like . So ladies please help me with a response to this brick head ! I don’t think she did anything wrong 🤷🏾‍♀️ men are always so quick to have an opinion on WOMEN AND OUR BODIES !

Only Kayla can take contractions like a G, I'm older and bigger than her and was acting a whole fool shaking and shat. He is absolutely beautiful. Good idea to get him circumcised early because he doesn't know what going on, some women wait and that's not good on them as they get older

Idc how funny y’all think that shit was saying stfu to nurse or doctor was rude as hell cause they trying to help her cause anything could of happen to the baby or her by not calming down and yes I understand child birth ain’t easy so don’t come trying to spit facts all pregnancy are different but this my opinion I hope she did apologize beside that he’s a beautiful baby boy Nd thank god her labor went good

Congratulations beautiful..prayers of safe delivery..
I swear some nurses are so annoying, you're trying to push and they're saying that you're doing it wrong. Like girl- you try it, it isn't that easy. And I don't understand why they have so many in one room, that's too crowded for me. Some nurses need a lesson on how to be patient fr
“I can’t calm down stfu” TOOK ME OUT OMFG

I told my husband with our first pregnancy that I was ganna shower and do my makeup before going and he was like 'you are not ganna get time to do all that '. I started contracting after we went to bed so I got up, in so much pain, took a bath and did my makeup just like I said before waking him up telling him 'it's time! We got to go'. He rolled over talking about 'quite playing' trying to go back to sleep. I slapped him awake after that 😂😂

He is perfection... boys love you like no other. I have a son myself. He’s going to be loving you, calling you mommy, and being protective of you lol! Enjoy every minute of everyday with him, because they grow up very quick. Times will be hard, post partum is real asf... but you’re blessed sis. Congrats, Kay Kay. We love you girl. And that epidural is life!!!😂💯 I wanted to have him natural... they made me push at 9cm! I have back problems too, definitely can relate. I was in tears watching this.😩🥰🙏🏽🧸💙👩🏾‍🍼 #MommyGang
A quick inspiration - Nothing that has happened to you is a surprise to God. God’s hand is always on you. He’s ordering your steps. If the door is closed, it was supposed to be closed. If the person walked away, they were supposed to walk away. Don’t get upset, keep moving forward. God has already worked the situation out. He has something greater in store for you. Declare by faith, “it is already done” 💕🎆.
He look like his dad
“I can’t calm down shut the fuck up...........awwww you so handsome” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Thank you for what you said about being single & doing it alone😔. My baby daddy always promised he would be here but he did me dirty so I left him.. he says he wants to be in the baby’s life when he’s born but honestly who knows. Ladies, don’t get pregnant until you’re MARRIED. Doesn’t matter how much you think ur man loves you... my ex of 2 years promised me the world & promised we would marry each other as soon as I turned 18. But shit went wrong. I have my parents but I don’t have my baby daddy by side and that’s the person I really wish I had here..😔but it’s okay bc his mother loves the baby boy & is really excited to meet the baby. Ladies, don’t let a man fool you. If y’all aren’t married, don’t get pregnant. Please. ✨
The way she screamed “Shut tf up!” I— 💀💀💀😂😂
She said,  “you tryna see how thick I am? I weigh 136” BYEE😂😂😂😂
