*Lyrics*  All these drills ain’t going to make me richer bet they might just do for my little nigga  Little nigga want to be a hitta told him cut a cheque and go and be a driller  Fake niggas made them pictures bigger I was tryna show them to the bigger picture, No more showing haters middle fingers rather show the haters to my pinky finger, I rub her clitoris she lick my finger she font know she sucking on my trigger finger, Couple businesses and bigger blickys now we out’ere getting flicky flicky  Klappy said we’re making too much money next watch might have to be a Richard Mille  Feds wanna pree me because I made a killing both in the countryside and in the city,  How many times did we leave the judge livid  Contradicted then had to go step in a visit  Windows are tinted  Wind it let breeze in  Tracksuit in season  It match the interior  I don’t want to see no civilians  I’m done taking public opinions  I find it so so hard to reason  When they start to get my heated  I tried to peaceful and tell the ggz not to put teeth in I ask Edna to teach us forgiveness.  Somebody call God for me  Tell him this is daylight robbery  Somebody tell the people I want an apology for all of those broken promises, Promises they made but true they don’t owe it me, They said if I get lost they If I get lost they would come for me and comfort me, But when I got lost they abandoned me (And talked of me) They ain’t stick to their promises they taunted me (They ain’t walk with me)  So now if it ain’t for the fam then it’s all for me  Paa was struggling to cope with me he start to wish he aborted me, Oh how we tried everything even tried therapy, could never tell them what’s wrong with me  They said I couldn’t, I took away the n’t and apostrophe  They looked down on me that was hypocrisy  Come up from poverty blame the economy   You know this hustles a game of monopoly  Do I blame destiny or blame astrology, So many different philosophies, Before I learnt love properly They took away the only thing that belong to me,  What more do they want from me  All this litness it can’t make a difference  It was just me and my sister  Ask Edna to teach us forgiveness   Ask edna to teach us forgiveness yeah
anytime yo
trsh

Headie rapping like the bagman who always got handed the dirty work. Then one day he found out the dirty work yielded millions. But was dirty work all the same. Im here for it.
