Whenever I feel like stuck with painting my squats, I go back to this video and find new motivation.
The League of Votann = The United States of America = Distant untamed land/distant untamed space = Explorers, farmers, Laborers = Mercantiles = Technologically Advanced = formerly part of the Empire = Founding Fathers/Constitutional following = Votann.   Rock and Stone baby!!! My favorite and introductory race for 40K, I want more GW,  Nuff said =D
I am a Dwarf and I'm digging a hole ..............................
Rock and stone..
I wish to understand... Is it officially going to happen that the votan faction are going to be a real deal...or is it some form of an April fool.... It's just that I am hesitant about that subject😅
And now there in Mechanicus 2 lets gooooooo!
Why’d this show up in my feed?
FOR KARL!
Well, I really like Warhammer 40,000, but those ships are just ridiculous. Flying castles? I mean, look at the warriors with their armor and weapons—they’re really cool. But the ships… I just don’t get them.
How did i miss this?!!
Yeah, what am I looking at? First of all that was not a space hulk not enough chaos or Gene Steelers by a long shot. That was just a wreck but a pretty big one. but more importantly, this a announcement trailer but for what are we’re gonna get like a video game or a new book or is this just to kinda release all of the new wave, so I say again what am I looking at? It’s a trailer but a trailer for what?  Edit just realized that this video is three years old for some reason it recommended it to me as if it was brand new. This was to announce the Voltan as an New faction 😅
LMAO that ending
Eggmen again they don’t look like proper dwarfs
And in the name of the Lollipop Guild.... We'd like to welcome you to 40k!
if they arent riding in sidecars drinking beers with horned helmets they did it wrong
GW bring back the funny squat guys: we’re rich!
Wave 2 of the leagues has finally been released. Next unit should be tyrannid hunters. More darkstar hallbards to whittle your enemy down to size.🎉
ROCK AND STONE! oT
the thing about Warhammer lore, there is always more out there to find.
Trazyn : "You know Orykan, I think I’m donate my entire collection to the imperium…WHEN THE LIGUE OF VOTANN GET’S LORE ! HA HA HA HA HA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣!"  See this video : 😐  Orykan : "You still gonna donate your entire collection, Trazyn 😏?"  Trazyn : "No I think not 😒."
Space orangutans when?
I love imperial architecture so much
"Cinematic"
Never forget, this, this is how you do a true April Fools.  Your wallets never forgave you!

Can't wait till we get some books on these guys or a campaign involving them. Interaction between them and the Imperium will be really interesting.

¡ROCK AND STONES!
Rock and Stone Everyone!
It only took... 20 years? Maybe in a decade and change we will get eldar riding dinosaurs again
As a longtime general of Dwarfs in WFB, I was bummed that squats had gotten, well, 'squatted' by the time I picked up 40k.  I played a few armies but it never really felt right.  This trailer honestly got me back into 40k, I was so pumped to se my bois back.
The sheer balls on GW to drop this on April Fools and make everyone think it was fake, only to post the next day and say “Oh, you thought we were joking?”. Absolutely based beyond belief. (Still patiently waiting on a book for the short kâhls though. Keep cooking, GW.)
More leagues of votann lore when? Also will they be getting a big single entity mech unit like other factions have?
Nice trailer 👍
Awesomesause
