Are you happy to see Brock Lesnar return to SmackDown?
Man I miss old jr ... Cole an this other clown is trash
That dude with the 2 belts in the crowd is a total cornball
There is no else left Wiseman Brock Lesnar was left though
The glaze from pat when Brock lesnar came out is crazy😂
Brock Lesnar came in delivered he rocked the Bloodline
Wiseman there is no one left
I’m back
0:06 0:07 0:10 no one left 😤😤🔥🔥
This is gonna happen again but with Seth Rollins just the past on repeat which does explain why Cena said what he said Abt bringing back the old WWE going back in the past Seth Rollins group is just the same as the bloodline here
Wasyoujasson☝️
When WWE was still good and Roman was still the champion.
Man I miss Brock. Imagine the pop he would get now
Please do this vs Cena
The only man who took on the bloodline by himself
Brock’s ability to shoot for a takedown at that size is amazing
I would like to see Brock be the one who dethrones Cena
I was a lesnar hater but moment got me hyped when it happened
3:40 why Jay yell like that 😂🤦🏻‍♂️
0:30 Roman had that nonchalant laugh
Paul got out the ring so fast
bro the amount of camera cuts in this clip is insane
How fast did Heyman get out of the ring?
dont trust the beast brock lesner.
Brock Lesnar will return in the 2025 Royal Rumble to win
Brock vs Jacob fatu is something the world NEEEDS😂
Wow Brock Lesnar is strong 💪
that hand shake to f5 was way too fast... 3:22
When he said no one left they forgot about jey
We need that Survivors Series return🔥🔥🔥🔥
Roman Reigns: Acknowledge Me Me: Nuh uh smh
Hopefully this continues with Brock joining the Bloodline for Wargames
Totally would have been sweet if they followed up on this
Skyrim orc
Should've been Bobby Lashley
Super punch = weak finisher…
LMAO bro lives 2 farms down from the arena what y'all thought he wouldn't pull up.  I'm sure bro flew off his couch
1:21 Roman’s face he looked like all he could think is Sheeeeeeeiiiiiiiiiiiiiittt!!!
Roman sucks lol
Roman lames is so overrated 🤣
3:23
I am not going to lie here at the same exact moment before Brock came out. I said Brock Lesnar might come back then that’s when I heard it. I freaked out.
You gotta give Brock his credit,this man single handedly wrecked havoc to those guys always been my favorite wrestler!!
Brock lesner is just the evolved form of Pat Mcafee change my mind.
Who is here in 2024 we want Brock back
We want Roman back
To former Minnesota Vikings players in Minnesota legendary
brock is coming back idont when but is a surprise
1:20
Why do people shake Brock’s hand? There has never been a moment where he hasn’t F-5ed someone after one.
Everytime he goes to the ring its a routine.... Same thing happens every time he is on tv # @romanreigns
WHEN AND WHERE WAS THIS?
Alpha male...😂  smh white boys.
Gunther vs rr
Pat: "This dude got bigger!" 😂😂😂
Acknowledge you? You can't even win a fair fight. It's always an interference or some type of help from the Bloodline.
I tell you what!!!! it just comes to show that anything and i mean ANYTHING! can happen during a wwe event!!!!!!!!
I wonder if Paul knew that Brock was there
Yeah cause ur gonna get f5 d
U missed one guy.
QycuniPercente your WWWE Reign WWWE Jey HAVE you WWWE Uso you WWWE 👍 WWWE WWWE July 1st Www QycuniPercente 15quincy you
Good job
Roman reigns awesome best good going great
Brock deserves the championship.. it's long overdue
Lesnar will return in 2024 for reigns
0:49 acknowledge me
What a moment man
If randy ain’t clear to wrestle come survivor series, he’s my pick replacing randy and joining team Cody.
That one announcer only yells like a tard why is he even on the broadcast team
Tribal Chief you can’t win a single’s match
God I miss pat mcafee commentating. It was so electric seeing him show up at fast lane!
Nobody cares then and nobody cares now
Ahh the good ole days when Reigns appeared in person, not as an imaginary phone call by Heyman..
1:21 YEAH
"Why is there boss music?"
Brock and roman they rivalry was awesome but not like vince and stone cold steve austin
Brock was born as a Venom then a Thanos now.
I miss pat lol his energy was lit 🔥
Well, Here Comes The Pain!
A little over a year later and it was definitely worth it 😎
In this case Brock was called to replace Randy Orton for Summerslam
Commentators try too hard to make wwe sound like the lame kiddie garbage it is
Brock looked small
3:27
1:50 “The alpha male of our species” 😂 gotta love Pat 😂
No one should be falling for Brock's handshake attempts at this point come on Roman
the commentary be riding to hard off lesnar “ how did he get bigger “ 😂😂 tf
Ngl it's time, it's really time to change the look of the wwe title
Who's here after Cody's loss? There's truly no one left. ☝️
Brock I saw him before he could hurt someone
Why do these people keep shaking Brocks hand.. it always leads to an F5 lol
This dude returns more than my stage 4 cancer
being able to cut a promo is not a genetically transferred trait, apparently
BROCK LESNAR IS WWE
Adding Pat Macafee to the announce team best thing WWE did past decade
You could see roman go like, "God Damnit"
Brock looks like you came back from retirement from his ranch saying “and I finally rest and watch the sunrise on a grateful universe
Pat loves brock... you can tell by the way he talks about him
Man pat macafee is something miss him on smackdown can't wait for him to be back
I miss Pat McAfee 😢
Tom Brady talking to his coaches today... then Brock comes..
Brock Lesnar looks funny on the entrance way he was looking at Roman reigns with a priceless face and just standing there like a statue 😂😂😂😂😂
Best intro to interrupt anyone they just stop what they are doing
WWE is on a downward spiral. Why do you think they are bringing back other stars they kicked out
Steroids must be nice
I feel like a beast watching the beast destroy boring wrestlers
why didnt kross go to roman  he knos roman wel beat him
roman : no one left 5 minutes later : Brock returns Roman : ...
ikno its scripted .. but brock can beat anyone
Who knew a meh return would lead to such a fantastically chaotic LMS match lol
He’s so happy! 1:32
hes like a real life unlockabale charachter lol
was this brock’s theme with the old intro?
Old school POP. Lesnar just stands there 😂
How did he get bigger? 😂 He used to be over 300lbs lmao
Roman Reigns found his groove on the mic. I wonder how many hours it took him standing in front of the mirror to recite this.😆
Pat Mcafee will always have the best reaction to Brock lesnar
the uses never stand a chance against Brock Lesnar
L
1:06
Vince changed the script
"WISEMAN. THERE IS NO ONE LEFT!"
1:20
Brock’s arms look a lot smaller
Same thing is and will happen this Saturday at summer slam Roman will stand tall and Brock will get his but kick like Roman said there is no one left im  calling this Roman will retain both belts no way Brock will beat Roman not going to happen and I'm taking my money to bank
Some one please end Roman reigns 🙄
Roman's so light skinned.
2:20
Brock would have been champion if the uso's hadnt of interfered.... then again, this seems to be the thing... uso's interfere in reign's matches.... reigns interferes in uso's matches....
Brock needs to keep that cowboy look going. He has looked better in his career. And the facial hair.
I like how Roman actually went to shake Lesnar's hand.
I really like the new Brock
I think WWE Got corny because America gets offended so they toned it down a lot 😞 now it's real corny wrestling
OMG ITS SHOCK LESNAR!!! see what I did there. Cause it isn't shocking? No just me okay
Oh look ... a teaser for Wrestlemania 86
The Alpha Male of our species.  Lol
this feud is the new John cena vs randy orton
I think Brock should fight the Usos for the tag belts. Beat the Usos and Brock becames the undisputed WWE tag team champion.  😂
Roman is eatin' good! With the Dad body!! 🤣🤣🤣
Brock needs to win
Bork laser beats up maui
brocks back yeah we are happy!!!!!
something new from wwe
He’s the only one that can realistically be roaming clean like he has been doing.
Vince cares about the people who actually go to live events and buys merchandise. Dirt sheet and internet trolls will never decide the direction of WWE as a company. Orton and Cody were major parts of plans going forward. WWE is trying to sell out Summer Slam. Makes perfect sense bringing in Cena and Lesnar.
After summer slam Roman will be gone until Mania season. They are taking the belts off him at Summer slam. Last man standing match will probably be a double count out. Whoever is money in the bank winner is cashing in.
Vince cares about the bottom line. Lesnar will put behinds in seats. WWE made more money this year than ever.
Roman is the best ever
If Lesnar had his ways, Roman wouldn't be standing. It's a given fact.
Brock Lesnar is so much better as a good guy
It's super obvious..the anger ain't there anymore
No more juice for Lesnar..
The beast is unleashed. Roman has never beat Brock straight up. He has always had to cheat to do it. Brock just handled him and both Usos. There is no way Roman will ever beat Brock straight up. No one has ever manhandled Roman reigns and both Usos at the same time except Brock and he has done it 4 times already.
Brock cleaning house lmao.
It looks like Roman is gaining weight 🥴
“THE ALPHA MALE OF OUR SPECIES.” -Pat McAfee
Another boring paper view thank God I longer pay for them and just watch highlights when others post them because this is going to be boring 😴 asf
Why do I still get goosebumps when I hear Brock's music?
All the people crying about seeing this again are the same idiots chanting "fight forever" at Sami Zayn and Kevin Owens. Lmao
Ok so rematch for the titles Brock wins, Roman goes to Hollywood and randy orton returns and gets a title shot against Brock. Your welcome.
I gotta be honest this might be repetitive but I still like to see Brock ragdoll everyone around him.
It’s crazy that all the cry babies on here cry about Brock coming back   Yet the rest of the world loves him especially that crowd
Brock needs more juice
Let's face it WWE will never allow people like riddle to walk away with one or both of the main titles that's why we will continue to see the same old match ups over and over again.
Roman has definitely gotten back alil smaller again. When he came back and started this run he was jacked asf
Roman getting fat 😝😂
Cena vs Orton. Might as well
So glad to see Brock back
Nothing against Lesnar and his wrestling ability. Unfortunately for him he was defeated  by the tribal chief Roman Reigns. Like or not!. It is what it  is Roman is the Unified Champion 🏆 🥇 .  This is his destiny and time to rule. Favorite quote "Acknowledge Me"
Thank God WWE is presenting a new original idea that... nvm
I’m sick of these two fighting, while Finn Balor technically could’ve beat reigns but they gave to explanation for his loss he took earlier.
We love to see the Beast.  Yet, Roman v Brock is stale.   Please start new feuds for the Head of the Table and Lesnar with other wrestlers.
They need to bury Reigns because the simple truth is his reign is undeserving to be this long.
**tru BEAST !!
roman kinda gained some weight 🤣
I love it when Brock's music comes on and the looks of fear these guys have when they see Brock come down the ramp with that smile on his face that says " hey, you forgot about me!"...
Another match? This rivalry is going on forever and ever.
This is what are business is about folks and don't get much bigger than this.  As the Great Hall of Fame and One Of the  Greatest Commentators of All Time as  Good old Jr would say and man oh man  he was right. What a earthshaking Pop like old times when stone cold came out white hot 🔥 as the super baby face with attitude and the look on Paul Heyman's and Romans face tells the story perfectly for the biggest rivalry of the last 10 years almost and in the making.   I absolutely Love how Just as he says there's no one left which was a classic from a mature roman finally starting to get it being silent and a few words and wrestling pychology will always paint 🎨 the picture of the blood sweat and tears of a wrestlers lifetime over any high spots of are generatio. These alpha males have gone through it all over the years and to stay on the top of the mountain and finally show clean who is the King 👑 Alpha of the wrestling species once and for all hopefully like the olden days in a another 1 year knock down drag out fight to the Super Bowl of Immortals at WrestleMania next year and could be the greatest rivalry since the attitude era and golden era on a collision course to a combined showdown of every generation of are lifetimes.

Bloodline welcome to suplex city
Every star that came to wwe wasted their whole career to see 2 men get the spotlight over them smh
Same thing that he did to Cena in 2012😂
Brock is the only reason why I watch WWE 🔥
That commentary seem so forced when Brock came out lol 😂
I feel like Vince has to have Brock win this match at summerslam.
Not Brock lesnar
Paul Heyman should be known as "Wise Cracker"....
That commentator needs a chill pill
Glad to see I haven’t missed anything in the last 6 years…
Oh, this again.
Steroid user  All over his voice
Imagine roman is gonna leave so Heyman turns on him
Stay salty , this is epic
This cena & edge all over again
WWE isn't even worth watching anymore.  All they do, is the same matches over & over & over again
Reigns is looking kinda chunky. Is he ok?
Well,  let's see if Vince gets outta this one.
Roman killed WWE.................Worst ever
Not the time for tribal chief to lose a title. That’s what I hate , they can’t just put Brock and someone else in a feud without a title. Let him work with some young hungry fighter type talent. Let Roman get someone from NxT to step up
Please sign Bray Wyatt back. The Fiend would be perfect right now
Well here comes the pain
There’s something we haven’t seen before
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥SUPLEX CITY B....ICTH 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is so boring why the same people over and over I’ve seen the match a thousand times
THE ONLY REASON WHY IS BECAUSE IT'S ALL FIXED. YOU COULDN'T WIN AGAINST THE RING INSTALLER.
wow ive never seen this fight before ! 😐
Its gonna be Summerslam 2050 n they still gonna have these 2 fools
I would wanna see Roman trying to smash Veer
I ain’t watching smackdown anymore because they keep Roman vs Brock and Roman saying the old promos that’s why raw is the dominant show I wanted Brock lesnar vs edge and Roman reigns vs Omos
Fired McMahon to be able to afford Brock lmao 😂🤣😂🤣
Really, again? Who cares?Tired of this over and over. How about Lashley getting a shot at Romey? Something different since Orton is injured..
Brandon love love roman thanks for letting me guys
Jeeez Roman vs Brock for the 100,156,786,647,887,544,678,479th time how exciting 🙄 way to go wwe
I'm more of an old WWF WWE fan and big time UFC MMA fan. I'm not much of a fan of the new WWE but when Lesnar comes back I'm in.
We don’t want this. We don’t want this. We don’t want this. We don’t want this. We don’t want this. We don’t want this. We don’t want this. We don’t want this. We don’t want this. We don’t want this. We don’t want this. We don’t want this. We don’t want this. We don’t want this. We don’t want this. We don’t want this. We don’t want this. We don’t want this. We don’t want this. We don’t want this. We don’t want this.
I'm just wondering when will these 2 storyline change.. Develop others and let them do what they do
WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE HIM!
Sucks that all titles are the blood line
4 words Money In the bank
Hard to take Brock as the beast when he dresses like hillbilly Jim
It wud b going into old bag of tricks... but🙏🙏 give me Seth to win MiB & cash in for title  for win (Roman vs Seth... Seth always wins)
Brock only one can pick FAT boy up. Roman be FAT
I never comment on videos but this is getting old tbh weave  seen brock champ for 2 years then now roman. i was hoping riddle would win. they don't know what to do. everyone knows that brock is going to win and Hes going to keep the title for awhile. or brock will lose and somone will face roman in a week and win. But brock is gonna win we all know
Im so glad I got into the champions league wwe looks horrible
Plus we all know it's Minnesota...how can you have a show in Minnesota and not have Lesnar
None will pay to see developing stars in WWE...
There should be a triple threat match for the titles between Reigns, Lesnar, and Lashley winner takes all or split the titles between Raw and Smackdown
They really did write themselves into a wall with roman beating everyone , this could be interesting if they do some type of retirement match stipulations , Vince is literally squeezing every penny he can out of these two ,this match would make a lot more sense if brock would have won at wm
Bro WWE has gone down hill after Covid-19 it’s not the same anymore they gotta bring back some of the wrestlers that they let go
Of course brock will beat Roman he is not getting the belt...then in the match he will fall of the ropes.
wHoA bRoCk LeSnAr! tHeY hAvEn'T wReStLeD iN wEeKs!
Brock pose to been won both them titles that was a bs match can’t nobody beat Brock one on one
I hate that WWE is still so successful despite their staleness
Lesnar is a looser. WWE are not able to bring someone to fit Roman, that’s why they are bringing Lesnar back over and over. Roman is already done with him and took him down by himself. ROMAN is the FACE of WWE, we like it or not
This is so played out
Turn away from your sins and accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior while you can!! God loves you all so so much!!! 🥰❤️
Lately there has been more Brock lesnar returns than his wins 💀💀💀
I really miss the dislike button
Welcome back cowboy Brock 😈😈🔥🔥
Roman reigns Samoan side is popping up lol
Just think Brock probably got paid 1m for that 2minutes
Maybe it is another swerve from Heyman.  Maybe since Roman is going full part time, he will jump back to Brock to have a purpose.
How many times is the WWE going to do this same dance!🙄 Smh (boring)
How many times are we gonna see Brock come back and fight Roman at this point. It’s not even a surprise anymore
Welcome back BEAST!!!!!
I hate Brock’s “Ram Ranch” gimmick and outfit..
Should have paid the fiend the house to return for this
Nice pony tail cup cake
BROCK WILL ALWAYS BE THE BEAST OF ALL MEN now Roman acknowledge THAT FOOL
roman reigns knew brock lesnar was back there that's why he took his sweet time
Yawn do something new I know why I stopped watching now guess that will be SummerSlam 2022 headline where Brock win and pick which brand he wants to be champion of so they can have 2 champions again 💥 have a good day
Reigns got chubby fast
If there was a brain among the folks in Washington DC, the White House would hire Paul Heyman.
Welcome back to Asleep City smh!
Why again, we already smashed Brock.. give the opportunity to Drew or someone else
Never trust a handshake from brock lol
Brock looks like hw stopped working out
Yesterday 👍👏🔥🩸💩🥱
Brock Lesnar can be champion this year in 2022
Politics won't let the White man win.
Politics won't let the White man win.
Nice brock  lesnar is back  maybe him is the new champion  2022 soon
Reigns should try carrots every now and then
Brock left the last match for surgery I'm glad he's back
It is time for you to approach everything you do during the day consciously. You should constantly control your thoughts and feelings. Any negative thought in your consciousness must be nipped in the bud. Protect yourself from everything that contributes to the existence of negative thoughts and feelings in your consciousness.
1 MAN WAS FRAMED AND DEMONIZED AND HIS NAME IS CHRISTOPHER BENOIT
Dislike
The Beast returns & strikes!!!👍💪
Brock is left Vince keep letting you win if the uso don’t help you Brock will beat you down and it is acknowledged me not inknowledge me
Was here for this live…the pop was chilling. One of the better moments I’ve seen live.
Paul Heyman knew Lesnar was coming back look how he acts
That ain't no ghost that's the original monster
hey look its that one dude who keeps getting duis lmao.
Roman looking a bit pudgy around the waist.
He should F5 Paul Heyman too
Brock's losing his muscles . Lord
dam roman got chubby since i last watched wwe
We ready saw my match 5 time in WWE get bored
Brock back to USA 🇺🇸 to save Americans 🤣🤣🤣👍
this wouldn't happed if you didn't release all those people
The beast ain’t done yet
I don’t watch wrestling because wrestling is stupid, but I do believe this video just single-handedly changed my mind. Wow!
Now thats shocking who would of thought roman vs brock for the 25th time
Paul Heyman knew it
oh my god can you just make roman have a different, threatening enemy?
The alpha male of our species😎
So what happened to that Drew McIntyre vs. Roman Reigns feud that really never took off? 😕
Bloodline 🩸vs. The Bullet Club ☠️
why does it seem that WWE is trying to make up for all the past garbage they pulled on Polynesian wrestlers?!!!!! my mom was adopted from Samoa..... even i am sick of this mess!!!!
I wonder if Reigns will be putting over Lesner ?
Let’s talk about the most important thing why did they let Sasha banks go?
He sounds sick no wonder why he was gone
Bron Breakker has a mixture of Brock and Reigns somewhat imo...
Roman looks out of shape
Why are their voices so deep?
1:23 Michael Cole- omg
Susos
This is sad and pathetic...have some imagination DO SOMETHING ELSE
Wwe make me so mad!!! Give some one else a push for once!!! I like Brock but we have seen this already!!!! And both of them not even on the show on a regular basis
I would love to see something else bc this is just boring.
COULD IT BEEEE? Oh no, it can't be!
Would like to see Goldberg team with Lesnar to take on the Usos
emmy😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😎😍😍
🤣😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😍😍em,myy
Now with vince out of the way, we MIGHT see new story lines,.......LOL
Really tired of the same thing with these two individuals,  he leaves then comes back for roman. Pretty boring now. Brock is old news.
HERE COMES THE PAIN - BROCK LESNAR 😀😃🤗
If Cody wasn't injured, he would take on Roman
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates—🟥
Is it me that i havent watch wwe in long time , but is roman getting fat ? And brock looking less buff ?
Make sure no one interrupt and make sure roman don't cheat this time..
As a certain A-Lister would say: REALLY??😔
Im always happy when I see Lesnar back
Paul Heyman- excuse me gotta go to the restroom.
I liked Brock when he was a heel. And I still like him as a fan favorite. He will be the champion again.
In real life is a whole other story it’s all for show
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
0:02  "There's no one left"  Well that *IS* true.... How many times have we seen Brock Lesnar vs Roman Reigns?  And if Brock Lesnar does beat Roman and win the title,  does anyone really think Lesnar is not going to disappear for months on end till the next big payperview (Survivor Series)???
I'm so over this
Great Stand Play!!
check out the new official twich clips is really fun!!
Pat really sold this return
Oh shut up Roman  with egnolagments
If their was ever music for a fighting machine, Brock’s would be it 😂
Good entertainment lesner could beat reigns whenever he wanted To
Again?
The return of the Brock with vengence.
Ok I’m done watching wwe, we not sitting through this again!
Aew is better
I’ll be honest, I kind of expected this one to happened. Given the fact that Lesnar wrestle for Minnesota.
paul heyman should work more with the younger stars !
Is it just me or does Roman look like he’s lost some muscle. I mean I remember wrestlers being jacked…what’s going on
Brock is best for business
Like too see Brock back up riddle
I'm so glad. Brock is. Back
We didn't ask for this.
Is roman making his voice deeper
Tribal clown ain't so tough when that music hits lol Be glad when he's gone
We are the one's
For 13th time this year….
I’m thinking that Roman will retain the title and Randy Orton will return at Money in the Bank and win the briefcase and then after Roman wins Riddle will do something or Randy and then Randy will win the title and maybe start a feud with Riddle idk but I feel like at some point when Randy comes back he’s gonna win the title. I hope I’m right because that’d be crazy
Im from Minnesota, that crowd his trash. If it was Chicago they would be screaming the whole time.
Dam Lesnar vs reigns AGAIN? WWE running out of ideas
The curse of not building up new stars
He’s like my created fighter owning all the belts
Brock is going to be the new champion
This is so getting old just like every time they bring goldberg back. I liked goldberg unstoppable angle back in the day. They took the same angle with brock. But was never as believable during the time he came along. This shows the constant weakness of WWE that has not been able to find new talent strong enough to do what was done in the 70s, 80s and 90s.   The product has not been great in decades and have been repurposing talent and reintroducing the same talent that has aged out from that era.
Brock Lesnar currently carrying the whole wwe company, without him the company is a total trash. He is a living legend.
I stopped watching because of Butt Lesner and Lousy Rhonda Rousey and Scary Flair.
Is  trump wraslin today,
Sad this is wwe boring af , I miss the early 00s
Face Lesnar without his advocate is boring
I hope Lesnar gets demolished. These walk ins  of some kinda make me bored. BYW, Cena? Again? And then again licking the wounds for years?
Blows me away people can look at this and be satisfied with the product. Every promotion has it’s flaws, but at this point it just seems so insulting to your own intelligence to be a WWE fan, like didn’t they do basically the exact same segment, what, 6 months ago? Not even? If you can enjoy this, then good god, more power to you, but it’s just getting painful.
iS TIME TO GIVE rOMAN THE BOOT..........
WWE needs to sign back half the roster they released eitherwise they’re gonna bring back half the legends that need to come out of retirement/Hollywood/part-time to be on the show lol
Tell him to get some bigger pants …. Roman looking husky
Change in voice didn't help
Man I'm surprised people still watch WWE much less pay to watch it with subscriptions and Pay-Per-Views. At least professional sports have outcomes that are 100% skill based (Minus the occasional fixing) and no prehearsed games. If I want fighting I'll watch real fighting like UFC, MMA, Boxing or bare knuckle fighting. No obnoxious "PROMOS" "HEELS" "BABYFACES" "GOING OVER". I'm shocked Vinny Mac is still in business.
Roman reigns got fat
Good To See Brock Back But He Is Barking Up The Wrong Tree, He Cant Do Anything With Roman Reigns
Cowboy Brock is back
Only wwe could make brock vs roman feel repetitive and boring
Dey need 2 get rid off him
Brock Lesnar is old as f***
Brock F5's the Usos then picks up tag belts and then smiles at Riddle. The CowBros vs The Usos would have gotten the biggest pop of the summer until Lesnar turns on Riddle setting up Riddle vs Brock and then Orton vs Brock.
Brock looks so small compared to his prime
Better than nothing honesty
Can't believe I fell asleep after watching the 1st hour of SD on Friday night.😩  So this is a shocker to me now lol.
Can we see Randy Orton fued with Brock for taking shots at the Tabel, like orton wants to like take them down one by one like a viper
I’m about tired of Brock Lesnar 😒 it’s getting old
Wow. I can't believe they'd give such a young fresh star like Brock Lesnar such a big push! Who says WWE can't make new stars anymore?
This match needs to be a Triple threat or Fatal Fourway. Enough is enough.
Brock can't afford to take another L to Roman...
U forgot someone tribal chump
If I worked in creative I would be so sick of writing storylines for these two
Not this guy again😩😞🤦🏽‍♂️ when will Brock learn that He cannot beat the tribal chief Roman Reigns is unstoppable
IM I THE ONLY ONE THAT NOTICED, BUT RR IS GETTING  HELLA FAT
🥱🥱
I'm assuming there last match will be at summerslam.
Should have been Sasha Banks
Spread the message, we are protesting the high gas prices by not purchasing gas July 3rd to July 5th.
This would have been better had reigns not already beaten Brock twice already. They had no idea what they were doing then and have now booked themselves into a corner with no new stars for reigns to wrestle
Did brock get thinner?
This is the feud that never ends. Yes it goes on and on my friends...
When was this?
Brock is the smallest i have seen him.
Reigns needs to layoff the cheese burgers
What tf happened to Romans voice I’m not rocking with it at all
Roman looks more heavier than usual
F*** that part time
They are doing Roman and Brock......AGAIN!
WWE has failed to develop and elevate their talent. You are left with the same old stuff again and again and again.
Bored…….. 😴
So Brock came back just in time. Roman is leaving now Brock will be champ. This is already. Brock needs to go back to the bottom and fight or fake his way up. Brock sucks.
If Randy Orton couldn't make it, they know darn well this should have been Bobby lashley versus Roman reigns. Those two are SummerSlam worthy main event. Tired of this Brock Lesnar rerun all the time.
No one wants Lesnar vs reigns again. Riddle should have won.
Shut up Cole!!!
No Randy Orton won't need an operation!!!!!!! Randy getting up, Randy is getting up, he won't need surgery or anything for his back!!!!!!!! Grandpa sent attendants saying "I'm making him, because of you I'm making him!!!!!! He's going to heal fast, really fast!!!!!!!
I’m just waiting for Cody to get his shot and win the title, but knowing WWE they will make him get buried by Roman like every other wrestler he faces.
Polynesians along with Mongolians are super people
Brock leaner is old man
It's not surprising brock leave to handle outside affairs immediately he comes back he instantly becomes number one contender and gets the title what's the point of the IC title and US title it use to be you were the automatic number one contender to the world title if you held one of those titles
At this point, I'd rather see Vince & John Laurenitis vs. Shane and John Cena.
Roman puttin on those lbs...
Alright! Looking forward to seeing another 5 minute PPV Main Event Championship Match full of shoulder blocks in the corner, into a belly to belly suplex, into multiple German suplexes, into an F-5...oh wait, did I just call the spots on Lesnar's last 10 matches?
Are this show are real .i wondering because still so many peoples are  watchining😮😒
Still all these years and still fake.
Vince: Brock, son, I need you in, asap! Does $10 million per appearance, sound about right?   Brock: Make it $15 million papi & i'll dance with the Big Dog.
I was there
J3 DA SHOOTA TAPIN IN ND IM STILL WATCHIN THIS FREE DA REAL
I'm so tired of the Brock vs Roman story let's move on. For the love of geeeez.
Lesnar and Reigns are both off the juice, still pretty massive humans regardless.
Great brock and Roman 2025 times. I wonder what will happen. Brock quit at WrestleMania to McMahon's face so I wonder what the heck happened.
Roman reigns beat him cleanly at wmania ! What's the point ?
Yesssss i hope broke beat roman and embarrassed him
Destruction in a 5 minute span.
They brought Brock back to distract the negative energy because of the Vince incident it’s a cover up
lol looks like roman is off the juice
Lady's and gentleman that's how you cut a promo.
Brock lesnar look smaller
Man... not again
Idk if I’m the only one but I’m tired of seeing Roman as champion time for a change
Brock Lesnar is literally Half the Man (muscle wise)that he used to be.
No one cares enough for this to be happening.
This is so funny. What a great sport lol.
Lol
Brock Lesnar is so powerful
I love brock Lesnar
Is this suppose to get our eyes away from vince?
Ohh wow who’s ready for 15 finishers
For the whole time I though WWE was fake. I was rong !
I like the Usos and Roman Reigns.
Brock is the best wtestler i'n the world
I love brock Lesnar
Anyone else tired of this roman run? Yea sure it was cool seeing his first year as a heel and all the head of the table stuff but now its just repetitive.  They built him like superman beating every big star in Wwe so like ok now its just the same matches
Brock Lesnar is a king
Brock Lesnar Will kill You i'n real fight
One main reason I don’t watch WWE anymore…. Exhibit A 😔
The match we've all been waiting for Roman vs Brock for the first time anywhere... I hear insanity is doing the same thing over again and expecting different results
Roman.... acknowledge that Hand shake... whoops I meant that F-5 lol
This whole “acknowledge me” is killing the views and the company. Vince is killing the company and its like he doesn’t care how do you let talent walk out the door over and over and think you’ll continually be great
Awesome reaction with Brock Lesnar
Me: How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man  Vince:
This is old
I haven't watched in a long time. Props to Roman, but he's getting a belly.
Nice to see you  back.
It's amazing you couldn't get the job done all on your own
Great homecoming  for Brock
The big cowboys from Texas Brock Lesnar
Brock Lesner's 20yr anniversary
Bro leaz vs Roman again. Just let him hold till Cody that’s the match everyone wants
Pat....Do your thang bro!!!
Roman sucks. He cheats to win. He can't win one on one. I hope he gets knocked down. He is the head of the kids table.
So fake lol
I don’t wanna see dis again Roman beat Brock twice! I’m done !☝🏼
I think what will happen is Rollins will win MITB and cash in and take one of the belts off Roman reigns and then Cody Rhodes comes back and wins the rumble and wrestlemania will be Roman vs Brock and Rollins vs Rhodes
That’s Triple F5. Not a suplex, whoever that announcer deserve a 3 days suspension 😂😂😂
Brock and RkBro vs the Bloodline 😩🍿🍿🍿🍿
Is it just me or does Roman not have a good and boisterous mic presence. You can barely hear him.
Dean Ambrose should return to fight Roman...Cesaro, Robert Roode,Ciampa, Bronn Breaker...all good names that could have been in title matches with Reigns but still we get Lesnar
Is brock aiming for MITB briefcase ?
The feud that never ends surely!
Getting older and he can still toss those guys around and not flinch " Beast
I guess they don’t have faith in RIDDLE 🤔
This storyline will never die
Anyone notice reigns is getting chubby? Time for the jacked Viking to come knock the husky chief right off his throne lol
They shouldn't have had Rollins attack Cody after their promo together. Then he'd be considered babyface. Do the Rollins vs Reigns thing again instead of this.
This is getting old
Broooo stop bringing back Brock😭he literally only shows up on paper views
DADDY come back for what’s his CHAMP
It actually looks like Roman got Bigger!!
HE DID THIS TO JOHN CENA
Uh-huh Brock's back AGAIN great.....now add Bobby Lashley and have a triple threat. At least then it'd be something not exactly the same.      And might I add Judgement Day vs Bloodline....missed opportunity :T
Roman owes him a rematch
So now they are going to pass the title back and forth between part timers?  Nice.
Reminds me of when Batista 3v1’d legacy
It's getting old 4 real man.
I'm happy Brock is back, not happy to see him an Roman for the 20th time. Was I the only one waiting to hear "IF YOU SMELLLLLLLL" ?? Lol or someone returning or a call up
Pat Mac-A-Fee with one of the most recent  historical calls in the history of professional wrestling since Jim Ross 🎙️ .....
Brock is really putting together quite the career after leaving 8 years.
I see Roman Reigns, is still no better than he was the last time I seen him on the mic 5 years ago. lol But he is fatter.
The fued that keeps on giving and giving and absolutely giving nothing
Brock Lesnar should challenge Roman Reigns for the title again, but this time if Brock loses he can't challenge Roman Reigns again for the title. 🤔🤔
Brock is so quick for a guy his size.
Imagine had it been solo sikoa or even a surprise free agent hire from Jacob Fatu who would’ve came through?
When the subtitles don't match the scene haha
I guess that's the cure for scandals?  LOOK OVER THERE!!!!
Havent kept up with wwe in about 3 years, geez what is with that voice changer
No one wants to see this idk what theyre thinking
It doesn't matter! Old man Vince won't let Broc win a title match and prove why Broc is THE champion.
brock is the beast incarnate and yall cant take that away from him
Oh I hope they make this rematch at Money in the Bank official.
Nope Don't like him at all
Again
Brock cant just keep skipping the line
Stop bringing Brock in. I’m sick of his face
This is trash
You go brother
I dig it .
Staredown looks like you guys were going to kiss! 😏✌🤣
I'm sooo tired of this fued for the love of God the Brock lesner well is dry
Get him brock
Can’t believe I’m bout to say this but I love it.
Orton was going to be his next match and was probably set to win the titles but he’s hurt. That why their bringing Lesnar in, to take his place. Lesnar will win the title at summer slam.
How unoriginal sounds more like from The Mad Max movie witness me! This guys the greatest wrestler please not even close! 🤦
Kryptonite it’s is BAAAACCKK!!!
pat mcafee is a national treasure
So brock lesnar vs roman again to me it would have been bigger if roman lost the match
Trash
Rematch clause for wwe heavy weight title.
Brock vs Roman 4... I mean... this is getting ridiculous... At least make one with Cody to have a variation, bring a retired wrestler or bring Gunther.
Steel cage match no interference
Will Brock actually try to beat Roman this time? 🤔 He could have at Wrestlemania but seemed deflated.
Roman getting fat!
I’m really glad that WWE is bringing in a new storyline that hasn’t been done over and over
Why wouldn’t they start a feud with Drew McIntyre? You know the one that is a full time wrestler smh.
Roman can’t defeat brock, Roman needs low blows to defeat brock
WWE needs to be boycotted until Vince is gone
Wait wait wait did anyone notice how Roman was still walking after the f5 though 👀
Reigns got what he deserved. I will never "acknowledge" Roman Reigns. He is a joke.
Reigns starting to get that scott steiner chest
Next
Roman reigns 💯
Booooooooo
Que bueno que regreso la.vestia
Yahoo, what  a shocker! Sure hope their PPV match lasts less than 5 minutes again!
Is it me or was Roman’s voice significantly deeper here ? 😂
Add someone else into this match. Make it a 3 way. Bobby lashley. Cena. Rollins. Anyone.
Of course Brock wants his title back Michael there would not be a beast Brock led at if he didn’t have the title
Not to body shame but both Brock and Roman have lost muscle. Brock's arms looks average and Roman has no abs anymore. He looks puggy.
Pat McAfee: how did this guy get even bigger? Me: Push ups, sit ups and plenty of juice
Brock returns because of Cody’s injury
That pop was insane! Is Brock lesner in hall of fame yet? He’s one of the favorites 🔥 he still look the same after all these years !
Brock Lesnar joins 300 Club!!!
I’m Glad The Beast is back 🔥🔥🔥
Pat makes this awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why not mcyntire
Vince made one last call.
Yo me wwe now is corny
Had to get the usual "could it be? it is!" Line in -_-
Lol it’s funny af when they got retired wrestlers doing their finish moves on active wrestlers is funny af lol…they gots to be paying millions
Againnn SMH THIS SHOT GETTING OLD ITS BORING WATCHING BROCK VS ROMAN FOR THE 1000TH TIME
godbless yall my birthday is this month June 26 godbless me to see 34 years thank you Jesus God hapy fathers day God Jesus y'all acknowledge God Jesus don't worship other gods keep God number one Jesus our Lord love yall godbless us🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🌍🌍🌏🌎👍👍👍
Booo WM 38 their match was hyped then it sucked now they want to milk it more ? 💀
Roman: There’s no one left! Brock: SURPRISE SHAWTY!
I'm so glad to see Brock back I loved watching him f5 all 3of them 😄
When all else fails, bring back Brock for the umpteenth time
Hahahahaha U WERE SAYING❓❓❓❓❓❌❌❌❌❌
Brock knew he wanted to use the F5 when he saw who would be his future wife Sable using the TKO.
aint it odd i mention something bout brock lesnar returning on my twitter friday few hours later my twitter  suspended wish charlotte flair hurry up give me her nc number on my gmail already i want things hurry get better for me
How many times are we gonna see this. Is so old now
i need a cena vs orton match tbh
So they couldn’t have given Lashley the opportunity?? He didn’t even lose his title because he was taken out during the match….rather see him that Brock or Drew and definitely Cena
U cheated so u could lose the belts
Glad brock is back maybe this time we can get the belt off of roman
Atleast it wasnt goldberg...  ...
All of u are cheaper
Roman getting fat lol
WWE sucks  I mean wrestling sucks now
I know it’s been done before but this is still 4 of the best in all of wrestling.
isnt minneapolis very close to suplex city
this was so unnecessary
Roman are you sure there's no one left? Because Brock Lesnar doesn't miss sh**.
Brock didn’t F 5 Title every Member of The Bloodline He Left out Paul Heyman
Roman if knew better you’d do better. That’s like drinkin beer with stone cold, u gettin stunned son! Booyah
Wanna make summerslam better throw cena in the mix by having hiM win money in the bank
Looks like Brock Lesnar has some unfinished business with Roman Reigns.
Straight up wack!! Are you f**king kidding me again 😡 repeat again, again. WWE is getting boring, I haven’t been watching lately due to lack wack fueds… AEW is way better
Is that pat on the mic with that energy?? I love it
First 3 Seconds dull Asf 😂
WWE "creative" is trash. Embarrassing... two part-timers are the centerpiece of programming.
Is it just me or does it look like Roman Reigns is getting a little flabby? He's not as ripped as he used to be. Also, the Usos seem to be legitimately hurting everyone they wrestle. Seems they are dangerous to work with.
Should have been cena
"Brock lesnar dresses so stupid looking now" is probably what some ppl would say. Not me i didnt say that
Same soft and over done / recycled story line  Way to be creative WWE
They really need someone other than lesnar
Roman and The Usos don't know they have a huge target on their backs because The Street Profits coming for them, Brock Lesnar, maybe John Cena and whoever wins Money in the Bank
Brock is dope! But tired of seeing just suplexes aand Roman is trash!  Dude don't do any wrestling moves lol
Tired of Brock and Roman  matches. My boo Reigns took everyone down.🥰😎
Ohh God this again???🤦🏾‍♂️
Whose this fat dude in the ring next to Paul Heyman….. LOL.
Brock vs riddle.
Wwe is lame asf.. Wwf 4 Life. WCW was even better than this. 😩Turn it off….!
How many times we’ve seen this already
Brock Lesnar is back let's go
Brock’s old 😂
Butcher block is back!!!
A more improve cowboy here in wwe
hey at least didn't say smash
Roman Stains looking a bit soft .
I can start watching again. Lol
Nobody wanna see reigns/lesnar again, my god Vince let someone else run creative wtf bro
I rather see Roman Vs Seth again.
Why not have Bobby Lashley come out instead of Brock he lost his title and wasn't even in the match we like Brock but we're tired of Brock vs Roman
Again
I wonder of Brock returning had anything to do with Brock vs Bobby 3?
Brock looking smaller now 🤔
Roman put a few pounds in the gut yooooo… I haven’t been watching WWE for like 5 years now
Such a classic wwe feud. I love it
All I want is for Roman to be gloating in the ring with his "acknowledge me" and "there's no one left" and the arena erupts with "IF YOU SMELLLLLLLLLLLL"  That's all I want! I want to REAL tribal chief to show. The man who put them all on!
Brock Lesnar again? no thanks lol
Nahhh . Too repetitive.Wwe is struggling man . They need to revamp NOW!  Aew is not playing
Guys it’s not exactly like the previous storylines between Brock and Roman.  This time we have one of them being part time while the baby face tries to unsuccessfully take the title.
Aye Nick khan is the man to spit at not lesnar. Blocks just making some extra pocket change. I mean inflation is pretty high so with Bearded Butchers and WWE paying him he is just walking on gold. Notice brock don't gotta run down a 50 yard ramp for a rumble entrance.....
Anybody that's not named that loser Roman , Corbin or those losers usos I'm happy with. Seeing brock come out and clean house made my night
I watched this last night and didn't put it together that they were in Minnesota that's Brock's stomping grounds
Is it just me or is Roman looking very soft
At this point Reigns shouldn’t even be surprised when he sees Brock return. He should just be like “you again”?
Roman gained some weight
Roman loosing his definition
SummerSlam IF RANDY ORTON isn't ready WILL it be Brock , Cody, Seth, Edge, OR Braun Breaker???
Wonder how many weeks he'll stick around for this time.  Can't wait to see him do his 2 moves over and over and over.
Listen to that pop for cowboy Brock and tell me they don't need a WrestleMania in Minnesota. Make it happen Vince
This cool and all but tired of seeing Roman fight Brock need someone else for a change
No wonder WWE has such a problem with creative. WWE exec1: Here's a great idea for WrestleMania's main event. Brock vs Roman. WWE exec1: Alright, and what comes after that feud? WWE exec1: How about... Brock vs Roman? WWE exec2: Great! And then what's next? WWE exec1: Well then we could go with... Brock vs Roman? WWE exec2: And once we get through there, how does Brock vs Roman sound? WWE Universe: zzzzzzz...
Whom ever wrote this could had done better…. I would had had Reigns forcefully clear out the ring and get pumped…. LESNER runs to the ring and they both go hockey fight ham till one left on top
A lot of people are complaining and I get it. At the same time though, its important to have long term story telling. In the end it'll be appreciated. But I think Summer Slam should be the conclusion to their feud.
I wanna see Bobby Lashley against Roman
Brock is back
Wen is he fighting John cena didn’t he still that contract
There’s no one left because they keep releasing talent refusing to develop them the right way to where Reigns could have plenty of suitable challengers.
THE ALPHA MALE HAS RETURN.. CANNT WAIT TO SEE REIGNS CONTINUE TO WIN OVER N OVER AGAIN!!! NOT. IT'S REALLY GETTING OLD AND NOW WE ALL KNOW HE'LL HAVE THE BELTS TILL MANIA NXT YEAR..
Roman Reign's real best friend would be his Brock Lesnar on wwe
Bobby Lashley needs to be in this match to make it triple threat
GO BROCK !!! 🔥🔥🔥💪💪
Román has gotten fat
never happier revenge for riddle and Orton
Too many cooks, anyone?
Fatal 4 way orton, cena, reigns, lesnar look i just gave wwe the greatest idea theyve had since seth rollins was universal champ
I rather see a face Brock then a heel Roman
Brock gonna win and roman gonna go on leave
Sooooo cenas not coming back
Don't Know Body Wanna See This Again
The announcer is very annoying!!
Brock Vs. Roman again....🙄
this stale program makes you truely appreciate AWE VS NJPW!!
If WWE does protect Roman reigns Brock can win him 🤠 easily
Here comes the pain
I was in shock when Brock Lesnar returned since Wrestlemania then he F5 Roman Reigns and the Usos. Lesnar vs. Reigns last man standing match at Summerslam. What a way to end Smackdown.
I hate Cody Rhodes got hurt I rather see him get a shot at The WWE title
Smh. I was literally hoping to hear the fiend`s laugh. Nooooope. Brock vs Roman AGAIN. getting old
The Greatest Champ Ever, Is BACK!!!!!!
It's really nobody out there for Roman reigns come on Brock Lesnar again we just saw this at WrestleMania
Triple threat summer slam would be nice …. Lesnar vs lashley vs reigns ….. book it
This is why WWE keeps falling off, back in the day the older wrestlers knew when it was over
We need a match with Bobby, Brock and Roman now make it happen wwe
I want Brock, Riddle, and Orton to team against The Bloodline. that would be amazing to see
Thank God The Beast Brock Lesnar is Back, I prayed for this Day to come. Now we can keep  Smackdown on instead of switching the channel.. YES
Wwe. Is. Bringing Brock back to only have him lose to roman. For a 3rd straight time   who is writing these  bs storylines
😂😂😂 The old hand shake trick....lol! They always fall for it.🤦
There’s no one left they fired many let mark Henry find a new home and put Brock in next title match good work for a two hour drive
Why couldn't they have brought out bobby
First smackdown I've watched since the debut on Fox and first wrestling show I've watched since Mania this year. (I wanted to see the McMahon announcement and Riddle challenge for the title tonight.) This is still......... Going on with Roman and Brock. No wonder I don't watch anymore.
👍
how many times is he gonna keep returning and the crowd eats this bs up
Hahahaha 😂 Roman Got Smash 🤣🤣🤣 By Brock Good For Him And Kiss Them Belts Good By
And again lesnar comes back from months off and straight title shot
They brought Brock back for SummerSlam because Randy Orton will be sidelined for the rest of the year because of a back injury
These ring-side commentary people are annoying.
Maybe now Roman Reigns can stop being shoved down everyone’s throats for years  and years and years
Roman looks like he’s been eating good
Not again
I know everyone tired of seeing these two wrestle each other but if the rumors are true that reigns is taking a leave, they want Brock to hold the title n carry the company. I can see why they did it
i’m just glad it wasn’t goldberg
Brock is a stupid gimmick that needs to die. I have never been a fan of part time player that is overpowered. He always gets a boost but never really fights in any real matches.
My face when brock came out😐  Dont get me wrong best brock we've seen in awhile but c'mon wwe not this again. Put brock in the money in the bank
How many times has Lesnar come out and trashed everyone? Probably more than any other wrestler.
the look on reings face like again!!!??
Thought this was a old video, until I noticed the Twins had both belts lol
If Brock just give up he play as day lost to Roman at Wrestlemania enough already like for real
Paul had something to do with Brock returning I just have a feeling again 😂💯
Wha-
Cena and Orton was always interesting cause they split wins, with Roman and Brock the same person wins like almost all the time and it gets predictable
Again?
Alpha Male of this species 😭 but lost to Roman ? Oh ok
EAT SLEEP BREAK THE CHIEF
Let goooo
Hmya and a brock return takes eyes off of vince
I looked at my clock & was like there was still 8 minutes left in this show something is gonna happen & was not expecting that
I love Brock but this is something I'm tired of seeing
one thing about WWE they will make brock Lesnar relevant every year
Wow!! How many times with Brock? It's boring now Brock, brock??
Give some other wrestlers some burn This shows how bad the wwe's developmental system is
brock lesnar reminds me of rip from yellowstone 🤣
I wonder if WWE has Lesnar lookung like that to make Roman look good? He looks silly
I guess he'll actually leave this time, like he said he would........ more like medical leave. Brock injures every opponent he faces.
McAfee going nuts is always the best
Bro how many times are they gonna do this
We need the team of Brock Lesnar riddle and Nakamura versus the bloodline
Is reigns retiring?
😔😔😔
The Beast
I'll come and take both of your titles
Brock needs to get back on the juice.
Brock is cruising..for another bruising!  Lol
As luke Skywalker says... No one is ever really gone
WWE putting me to sleep with another lesnar and reigns fued. zzzzzzzzz so lame.
Pat is such a bad commentator lol
Brock looks good for his age💪 legend
wow another rematch for the 50th freaking time! i'm so excited🙄
Y’all complain about Roman and Brock like they ain’t the greatest dominate forces rn
Wash.  Rinse.  Repeat.
This is the best edit video I've ever seen
It looks like Brock wants just the wwe title. Roman can have the universal title I wouldn’t care about that
Wow I'm shocked the internet didn't ruined it..
Sorry to see Lesnar offer his hand to make him out to be a snake. Re-run of the last 2 years.
This the reason why WWE sucks today 😕 😪 😒
Next on Smackdown , The Harfields vs the McCoys.
We saw that coming
Where does Roman... Brock....rank amongst all time feuds?
Brock is a come.and.go wrestler
Trash show
Why keep bringing him back of nun gonna change Y’all just be bored atp
I wish riddle would’ve won
Heyyy roman say hello to the beast in carnate!!
I didn't see this coming!!!😭😭🤣
Getting rediculous....I really have they use Money in the Bank to get the titles off Roman....Seth should do it....Or Edge...Or Finn to put over the new stable while Rhea win womans gold
I don"t even watch wrestling anymore and I know that this angle had been overplayed.
Did he get bigger 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Brock is a rip off of a stone cold Steve Austin. Announcer said he got bigger. No same size .
Brock need to go to RAW
Tired of seeing Brock always getting title and disappears for month WWE needs to stop firing all the good wrestlers and keeping the crappy ones
🥵😡😱😱🤔🤔😮‍💨😤
Reigns is still terrible
Brock is just a sore loser
Bout time he comes back   I need more bi polar beast back in my life
WWE is so predictable.
WWE is a big fat joke the superstars have no Talent old and run-down who watches the show moron you might as well be watching rich people take a dump and that's the bottom line.
(SIGH)
Let's see reings get lucky again. Lesnar has probably been training like a monster, holding all that anger in, not looking good for roman.
3:52 Best thing ever said on live television.
pat is the best thing to happen to wwe commentary
They use the same script every time he returns🥱
Great, the same match for the 84th time.
Im so over brock and roman and these part time champs
Yawn, this Brock vs Roman is old. Roman needs to face someone new
Roman need to get back in shape
Why does wwe always use the same ppl for feuds when they have drew lashley and others on the roster to use give someone new a title shot this is what makes wwe boring
No  but whatever New blood is needed always 😝
Roman's been hitting the fork and spoon lately. Soon he'll be doing banzai drops from the middle rope
If they make Roman lose to Brock it better be so somebody else can take the title off Brock like lashley or riddle I’m done watching if they make Brock win and it’s a another lengthy title reign cause what’s the point
Not interested
zzZzzZzzZ
Not this again lol
I hated Brock's "other" character...I LOVE this one.
Bro Roman needs to lay off them cheeseburgers
Really ? Again ? Nothing new ? Boooring boooring boooring.
Good lord, what has this sport become. Laughing stock...
Brock is a loser loser loser!!!! Hahahahahaha
F Brock lesner
Roman looks a little pudgy.
Almost anyone would be better then Reigns at this point.
People are actually gonna realize how big of lose orton actually is. He made the terrible tag team division interesting.
Pat always makes a Brock appearance better 😂😂
In sarcastic tone: Oh wow Brock showed back up how could anybody have seen this coming!  such a shock! 🙄🙄
Wwe must be getting desperate cuz why Brock outta all people it’s like whenever they don’t got nobody to challenge they bring Brock back lol just for Roman to beat him again
Does this story line ever get old???? Broc returns broc returns broc returns
I think they are course correcting  since Cody got hurt
This is sad. WWE has no stars
why on earth would WWE make Roman shake Brock Lesnar hand🤦  that made absolutely 0 since 🤷‍♂️ time for more superman punches and back suplex    f-5
You're not fooling anybody with them piped in noises wwe.
WWE FELL APART MAN & Roman has no promo skills
he wore that hat because hes the new undertaker
Why won't they let us comment on the Vince video? 💀😂
I can't believe Roman fell for the banana in the tailpipe...the 🤝🏾 is NEVER just a 🤝🏾
Does Roman look chunky around the waist to anyone
Roman getting a bit of stomach fat now
Again
When in doubt call Brock 😂😂
again 😅😂
Okay Fr. If they have Brock going against him for the titles Brock will for sure win. If they have Roman win AGAIN then it’s just a waste of a summer slam
Roman gaining weight
Again….smh.
Again….?
20 years later and Brock still can easily ragdoll the roster
Lesnar is a Beast, I'm going back to the weight room, Thanks Broch
It’s getting boring they always does this
So Brocks appeared more on TV than reigns.   Yall cant develop can ya
Not really happy.  I just want new competition for Brock lesnar.  This feels like a ReRun of SMACKDOWN
Love this new Brock please don’t ruin it wwe
Every time Brock comes out the uso's and the tribal chef run to the back licking their wounds 🤣🤣
It's still nobody left Roman already beat Brock several times
SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS ALL YOU NEED TO PROVE THAT THE WWE HAS FLATLINED,. It's all about the funeral now.!!;!
I really love how WWE develops new stars and keeps story lines fresh....
So my prediction is Brock will replace Randy at summer slam.. he will beat Roman because it would be strange for wwe to continue to have Brock return and continue losing… once Brock wins he will face drew at clash. Drew will get his moment in front of a crowd and beat brock
I felt like drew deserve the opportunity he lay the challenge down along time ago
Crise climatique > lutte, si nous nous soucions des prochaines générations de personnes Climate crisis > wrestling, if we care about the next generations of people at all
I’m actually happy I’m tired of Roman reigns as everyone else should be too
No sami zayn to help his bloodline lol
Same, ole, same ole! Boring ZZZzzzzz!
Not this again they could have used Bobby Lashley
Roman reigns looks fat.
This feud will never end 🤣 can we get something new now like wtf
I’m so over this revival it’s been going on for like five years of this point
Man they ruined strowman.. I rather have him go on a run.
Welp, time to start building up for SummerSlam. Then the PPV comes, they wrestle. Brock collects his Millions, disappears again, the cycle continues. Blah blah blah.
This will b brock and roman last fight cause summerslam match is a last man standing match! I wish u luck brock!
Is there no one else.....IS THERE NO ONE ELSE??!! sighs 🤦‍♂️
i don’t watch wwe no more, but i don’t get the hype about roman. dude is very stale & basic. i miss people like Hbk, edge, etc
Why Brock? Why not Drew?
Ortan vs Cena take 9 anddddd action!🙄
Brock’s cowboy persona is awesome. Now he needs to do a few more moves in a match to help. His matches are still the same shtick which was cool 5 years ago.
So does this mean we get riddle vs Brock at some point?
Tired of this! Wwe need more superstars
Brock should just come out once a week and pick somebody to beat them up
They need fatal 3 way golberg lesner reighns
Brock returning makes sense due to the injuries. How long will Brock stay tho? Will it be the same 3-on-1? Brock getting his title back would shock NO1. Personally I'd send Roman to Raw & have Brock on SD until he leaves.
This is the same ole stuff where’s randy
It’s it just me or does Roman look out of shape???
And our ace up the sleeve .... Brock lmao . It’s true though
so boring and predictable. they should have had brock join roman and the bloodline they could have been the most unstoppable stable for next few years until you can develop a stable strong enough take them down
Bobby lashley is left
Lmao 🤣 they need new stars
That went exactly the way the script was wrote.
Roman is faker than those pearly white teeth.
How many times do we got too see Brock Lesnar vs Roman Reigns
These two guys are in a class by themselves. That stare down was epic.
Brad Taylor vs Robert Trujillo the bass guitar player from Metallica
Pat McAfee is such a jewel on Smackdown!
Lame.... Boring.... This Summer!!! Lesnar vs reigns part 23 At Summer Slam !!! Wth
You could have shocked everyone and Riddle being champion would have made news instead this repeat
I get not one ounce of excitement from this.
can yall push anyone else plz
Roman turned to baby face it’s time for bring  the old Paulman and brock back together that’s the one key if Brock turned heels again if Paulman turned on Roman and become the  champion again
Ugh
Great
He wont leave he is too perfect
I love that brick is back
Whaaat no way. They’re gonna make them fight for the 100th time. No way 😑😑😑
Never trust Brock lol 😆
I’m 57, not easy to impress but SMACKDOWN impressed me last night. A hard fought even match that had the crowd on their feet, a clean win with no interference, and a surprise at the end. I just wish it would have been someone other than part time Brock.
When there so confused on wat to do smh not another flair vs becky again fck man im slowly givin up on wwe honestly
Another reason to stop watching WWE, Brock vs Roman again WWE has no other superstar to challenge Roman And they already sent spoilers that next year Wrestlemania , Roman will still be champion So why watch when you know a years worth of spoilers
Do yall see  the plot?...brock beats roman for the title so he can leave to pursue his career in actin  In  Hollywood.
Whenever they don't know who else to humiliate they just call back Brock Lesnar lol
Randy Orton and Cody Rhodes are hurt. That why this is happening. Don’t worry, Drew McIntyre is the X-factor
Ahh Yes The Never Ending Fued
Roman and Brock again why I’m so over Roman and Brock 🫥
Oh gee!!! We get this?!? For the 237th time?! YES!!!! 30 minute supplex and spear match!!! Can’t wait!!!!
I’ve never seen Brock Lesnar look so small before, Romans arms are actually bigger than Brock’s arms.
Brock the beast ,F5 conquer suplex city yeah ha
The ring announcers are more annoying than brock lesnar return. They get all excited like lesnar been gone for years
How exactly does a F5 hurt? Looks painless.
They could've done Bobby Lashley vs Reigns.
It's was exciting  show was  overall OK but Brock was a shock but we all know how this feud is going to end, sad, and Roman was right their is no one else and when their is WWE  then burn bright and then get buried. Would have been better and more exciting if riddle would have won but they gotta protect their only trick pony
roman trying to make his voice sound deeper in vc
awesome I'm glad he back now I can start watching again
Roman doesnt need to face Brock Lesnar anymore. He already won him. Next chapter.
Bring back the beast. Till Cody gets back it's the only real choice. Who else is that over
Terrible terrible terrible
Brock and Roman... ... ... again.... YAWN!!!!!
So Riddle and Reigns have a very good match, Riddle can work and he is over w the fans.he has just been beat,Reigns put on a good show,took some bumps and he is tired.they bring Lesnar out after a tough physical match with Riddle to attack Reigns.thsts weak and total BS.    again like the last year several guys are gonna get pushed back so Lesnar can work with Reigns.its so ridiculous but not surprising
Obviously they brought him back, they were in Minnesota, his second home next to South Dakota
Idk if I haven't noticed this before but since when have they uncensored commentary as well as crowd chants?
Roman looking soft in the belly lol
Brock and Roman for 100th time. Creatively bankrupt.
Even roman was shock. That let's you know his standing in the locker room. People tired of Roman and this story line
Brock equals tickets.cause he's a legitimate fighter. He's there ace i the hold.
Reigns sounds like he’s getting over a sore throat. Did they ever say why he’s leaving ?
Are you f***ing kidding? They got a serious problem with building new stars. Wow, no wonder wwe sucks now. Keep bringing back old stars. Vince deserves what's coming to him
Is it me or is he getting chubby
they did this becuase randy Orton was supposed to face roman at summerslam but they needed a replacement at least it wasn’t Goldberg 🤣
Shame reigns went to part time cuz imagine how badass it would be if they ended the bloodline and created a new two man power trip with Heyman. It would be interesting to see if they could work as a team.
Brock will beat Roman this time
how did he get bigger lol
you guys made the beast into a joke by getting beaten by this guy over an over again no hype to a match we have seen over an over again
Okay I have a feeling Riddle we’ll become the new undisputed champion all because Brock! I’m calling it!
like wwe fans get cheated soooooooooo much didnt we just see a whole years worth of these 2 going at over an  over again with broke loosing every match cody an seth have been fighting for 3 months now wtf the same matches over an over again cheating the fans
They need it to be a cage match or something.
Can't wait to see this for the 1000000 time!
Great!
Riddle run it back Cody
Waooooo one family collected all the wwe belt. This is unbelievable n impossible to achieve
With randy out til the end of year…hands tied and don’t where to go….let’s bring the beast out!!! Can’t believe I didn’t think of it.  I thought maybe drew vs Roman at summerslam
Was there really no one else?? We just seen this feud.
One more to make Brock champ he might do it this time
Rule number 1..... When a returning Brock Lesnar extends his hand don't ever shake it
The Alpha Male Of Our Species is what Pat McAfee has called Brock Lesnar...... Cool
Finally Brock Lesnar come back I’m pretty sure this time he will get his title back ladies in German the new champion will be Brock Lesnar
Roman reigns has zero abs
Roman gotta get back in the gym. He flabby....shake back champ!
Cena needs to just come back and clean house or give RICK BOOOOGS the push
Brock and Roman again you can't keep doing the same thing over and over and over and over again???????????????????
I'm tired of seeing Brock and reigns reruns foreals that's old AF already @fox no more reigns and Lesnar that's old it's getting old already again again again again I can't foreals over and over and over fxxxxk really again I'ma start watching AEW foreals less talking more action on AEW Chris Jericho making it happen in aew this getting old already I'm.not watching if Lesnar again he needs to go after Lashley because he still wants to finish with Lesnar just let it happen again the winner best man in the company
BORING
didn't we just do this?
This is all they could create?
Thanks god he back😂
brock doesn't have that mass any more. probably because he's taking care of his health. Still he's a big boy.
Re-run
Orton Vs Reigns Vs Brock please
🍅 🍅🍅🍅
Wtf happened to wrestling. We need another Ultimate Warrior
Brock definitely didn’t get bigger. His arms look like they got smaller if anything.
Put Roman in there with sme fresh blood. That's the problem with WWE right now. Just no creativity with the writing. Build up some mid card guys & let them step up to the plate.
how many times are they going to play this same song
And the beast cleaned the ring in a blink of a eye.
I'd rather see R Truth take the title from Reigns right now lol
Brock should have never lost the title being honest. If wwe make Brock loose against roman once again yall stupid.
best return on Roman Reigns EVER
That crowd pop was hype tho
Roman looking kinda thick around the belly region.
How is a paper champion defending the WWE title.. when he's allegedly not appearing for the next two months
I simply hate Roman reigns
Wwe has nobody so they return to mid 40’s Brock……ugh
For there next match for 200 000 000 old man brock vs old man Roman reigns
How many matches they have are they still going wrestling when the old man brock lesner vs old man Roman regins they brock lesner might well come to ring in a walker
Brock has to beat Roman this time.
Again?
I had a feeling someone was gonna come out either during or after the match but didn’t expect Brock
Give us rocky
Bro again
YAAAAAAASSSSS!!! TAKE THAT 98 LB HEAD ROMAN REIGNS TO SUPLEX CITY!!!!!
And just like naruto and sasuke... we are back at it again. Papa brock cant stop seeking papa roman
Roman looks out of shape lol his midsection sucks
Roman is enjoying that time off see that gut😂☠️
Did Paul remember when Brock returned in 2012 and tricked John Cena with the handshake I guess he didn't he could have warned Roman
We're probably going to see riddle Lesnar.
should be a one n done since he was in his hometown but u know wwe probably have a match with them overseas
Wwe really needs some main event level wrestlers. Sadly the only credible main eventer theyve been building in nxt is only bron breakker. They need to make more than that.
Brock is old yet they still bring him up
Ohhhh yeeeeaaaaahhhh!!!
once in a lifetime match happening for the 10th time🙀😳
please god just have John take the titles
Brock again, oh man give me a break and that awful commentary kill me now😶
Why.
But why I don’t understand
I mean the dude is from Minnesota so the return made sense..
This was trash
Returning memories from 2012 remember when do the same thing with John?
The dream match you can only see 149 times in a lifetime
Glad to see Brock back though
LOVE IT!!!! Edge of my seat
he doesn’t deserve it wtf!!
1:30 Roman is making the face that everybody in the world is making when they say Brock come out 🤣. “Like why am I doing the s*** again! 🤦🏾‍♂️”
Man again?
So Happy to see Roman Reigns 💪❤️💪 Back👏🏽👏🏽Love the Bloodline 💕💯
If this match happens at money in the bank please give us bray wyatt to come back once and for all this would be a great opportunity for him to face roman at SummerSlam and make them have a fued
I love seeing Brock back but they really need to stop rematching them.
They need to do one of two things. Either give Roman a record breaking championship run, or allow a young talented wrestler beat him and give that wrestler the ultimate push possible
F-5 is so fake.
They should do a two man power trip type of deal with Roman and Brock instead of facing each other again and again 🤦🏻‍♂️ Like Roman vacates the title and have Brock face whomever: Bobby, Drew Or someone. I’d like that more personally.
Brock vs Roman part 72…..
There's No one cuz they went to aew the ones that can beat reigns...
So I guess this is summer slam ....
Great, lets rinse and repeat Brock vs Roman again cause there is no one left. And certainly dont build up to a Cody Rhodes match.
This is like peter and the chicken, they will never stop fighting.
Honestly, I’m glad to see the younger stars getting a chance. This is refreshing.
The old brock is officially back.
I’m tired of the same old Lesnar/Reigns match
DIE REIGNS DIE!!!
We don’t want to see Brock and Roman anymore
Roman's oily body is the reason I wake up in the morning...
Roman Reigns- "Acknowledge Me!" Brock Lesnar- "Not in my house!!!!"
Boriiiiiiiing. Why bring him back when you have enough people who can challenge reigns.
Honestly I think bringing back Cena would’ve been better !
And just like that, everyone forgot about hush money.
The cash cow finally came back
Wwe fired all the other big guys so they need everything they can get lmao
This is actually the dumbest thing ever.
So they couldn’t build no one else up???
So…. AEW…
Okay seriously Brock Lesnar had two terms three terms with Roman Reigns what day is please stop these rematches now in this match, I put money on it Brock Lesnar going to win.because they're trying to get Roman to rest and the only person that can take Roman place Brock Lesnar I mean that's the formula for WWE
I love when Brock fights y’all are gonna miss it when they retire I don’t complain I’m enjoying this cause when they retire I’m gonna miss these guys so enjoy it don’t complain
BROCK WINS IF ROMAN DOES NOT LOW BLOW OR CHEAT OTHERWISE !!
Really wish Cody didn’t get hurt now we get this bs again.
And all the people who love roman would say why did Brock return they are mad cause at MITB Brock will DESTROY THE HEAD OF THE TABLE THE TRIBAL CHIEF ROMAN REIGNS TO BECOME YOUR NEW UNDISPUTED WWE UNIVERSAL CHAMPION
I want Roman Reigns vs. Bron Breaker
Roman looks like he's seen a ghost? Okay a ghost that he's beaten repeatedly and realistically has no more reason to fear LOL
Announcer says Brock somehow got bigger, when he all have eyes and know he is a lot smaller than he was before he went to the UFC.
Brock the final boss of wwe😂
I said before this happen I was watching this in my moms room cause I’m a kid so I said please somebody return cause they need to beat roman cause I’m tired of him and ask you shall receive
On some real BS Roman reigns no he can't beat Brock Lesnar Fair square without cheating if he didn't have the Usos Brock Lesnar will run through Roman reigns and everybody know that
How many times is we superstars especially if the superstars who have had it happen fall for this trick that Brock does
Literally fought a few months ago... like 3
Wasn't expecting Brock at all nice surprise especially with the all the behind the scenes drama 💀💀😂😂
Something we've never seen before...LOL..boring = WWE
Why? What's taking so long for them to give Drew a push or Sheamus. At this point Brock needs to go to the back of the line. Give Brock another story why does he always have to be in the title run. He need to go sit down somewhere.
Lmfaoo I swear I love Brock 😂
Roman looking a little flabby
Acknowledge Lesnar
Dawg he already beat you.
Roman is getting that Samoa fat thing going on...
Brock... thank you WWE.....BROCK VS ORTON
Guess Money in the Bank sales are low!
The match-up/rivalry in itself is stale because the writers made it stale...but tbh, idc how many times Lesnar "comes back" I mark out 😂😂
I want a Cowboy Brock and John Cena Feud
Greatest? Ha. Roman makes his cousins do his work for him
Bruh just start spawning  in new characters every week and whatever catches our attention keep them smackdown roster got like 20 active members on duty 😂😂😂
Bold prediction!!! This cowboy came back only to take Romans” title belts. And Roman going to Hollywood.
This roman reigns gimmick is starting to get real stale
Vintage lesnar handshake into F5 😂
It's Minnesota so of course
Lol the Alpha Male of our Species! 😂
Dear wwe,                      If you won't give the title to Drew McIntyre.....give it to Brock....                                    Sincerely The WWE Universe
Brock vs. Roman AGAIN? 🙄
Finally brock is back
Yawn
am i the only one who wants to get F5’d or actually do one but i know i’m not strong enough. Brock looks so sick when he does it
I'm not understanding this
I honestly wanted riddle to win. He would have been a cool Universal championship for short period of time.
SuperFight 25
Same old same old. Yaaaaaaawn 🥱
Could have brought Strowman back. Or Cena.
Let Brock face Riddle cos Roman has defeated Brock countless times
Im so tired of seeing brock vs roman
We need a savior like Brock to save wwe from Roman!! Give us some good fresh content!
Brock gotta retire!
come on should kno brock was comin right back do what he want
Not interested
I mean this is coo. I guess but we seen this too many times. At least make it a Fatal 4 Way with Edge & John Cena. Heel Roman Wins vs All Faces
Vince is looking guilty he fired Sasha and then brought back Brock and I know Brock raped him for a lot more money
Roman vs Kevin Owens, Seth Rollins, Riddle,  Edge, Bobby Lashley, Drew McIntyre, Jey Uso, Jimmy Uso, Sheamus, Ciampa, Bronn Breaker, Melo Hayes, Theory/Cena in a triple threat...Please stop with Brock and Roman for the million time..
This is starting to become a Warriors vs Cavs finals series 🫤
Meanwhile bobby lashley is going after the US title why?
Román put on a few extra pounds since we last seen him
Is it just me or is Roman getting kinda chunky?
Pat is god
Look like the beast came out the cage
Ships sinking!!! Brock to the rescue
Your in Minnesota, which is or near too Brock’s home state and y’all didn’t expect this? Come on
I was really excited to see who would come out and it was just Brock. And now they are gonna fight. AGAIN. please stop recycling rivalries WWE please.
Roman looking a little chubby that vacation hittin well
dawg, lets just stop with the reigns and lesnar feud, its been going on for too long
I really dont mind seeing this match again but i think if Roman is winning, they should at least have him win cleanly! Because that’s something he hasn’t done, he hasn’t beaten Brock Lesnar Clean
I haven't watched any WWE events since WrestleMania. Now I can watch again because Brock Lesnar is back.
Roman is in god mode
Wtf who paid the reff it was 123
Funny thing about this is this match up gets old but those f-5’s don’t lol 😂
I'm a fan of both Brock AND Roman but no more vs, please.
Again!?
Why are they reacting like he'd been gone for years?
u take the usos out and romen reigns aint got no chance its script ill be so glad wen Romen reigns loses the title to brock lesnar just to see his reaction
Roman: There's no one left!  Brock: Hold my beer!
Again?! SMH
This is awesome! The beast is back!
When it comes to Minnesota, it is Brock Lesnar's home state.
So glad Roman got to be a heel
I swear Brock so trash
Oh yay …. More Brock vs Roman
Hi wwe the ones
So does this mean he's gonna win MITB?? 🙄🙄🙄
the only hope for this match is it being better than their wrestlemania bore fest. At the end of the day this had to happen, cody is hurt, orton is hurt, styles maybe couldve came in but hes also hurt. Drew is the only one who really should face him right now. Lesnar really is the last resort but he was going to come back eventually. Everything just got pushed sooner. Thank god we still got cowboy brock, at least the segments before the match will be entertaining. Lesnar sells, can't doubt that.
Honestly who knows how much longer will have Brock? I still get excited when he makes a return. Am I excited to see him vs Reigns again? Not really but enjoy it while we can
Y’all cant tell me wwe dont be lying about their ratings they do the same matches over and over and over like this why yall lose so much talent. This exactly why I stop watching a few years back because it gets ridiculous
I mean Brock’s the money maker as soon as I saw they were in Minneapolis. I knew that there was a 75% chance he was going to be there.
AJ Styles could have easily came out . Would have been a great opponent for Roman. Since his feud over with Edge but Lesnar coming out did surprise me lol
Lol this dummy Michael Cole said "could it be" after we clearly see its Brock
Roman got fat lmao
So what is Roman reigns keep deepening his voice? Is he trying to sound intimidating because honestly even after two years of y’all trying to push him, I would still go to aew or new Japan. You’re the reason I even saw this clip was just to see Brock Lesnar. Other than that the programming is terrible
Classic wwe
not him again.wish he would make up his mind .he told vince after the match at wrestlemania i quit.wonder how much dough mcmahon had to spend to get him back.but its ok he wont beat roman
Gee, who else could take the title off Roman but Brock.
"Sasha's gone, Vince quit,  so lets get Brock back!"🤣
This kinda makes no sense since he already beat Brock lol
This time.. let’s see Brock beat him for the titles..
Lack of main eventers
Is Roman gaining weight
This is quite literally the feud that never ends
For many years I wondered when they would book these two to feud.
We don't have any stars because the company sucks let's do the same stick we've been doing again and again 🥱🥱🥱🥱
Reigns looking bulkier
i wouldve picked the Fiend returning but brock is an alright choice
I’m gonna do the same thing when I step back in the cage this time I’m not gonna play around this time I’m not gonna hold back and that’s in five months
Roman ran his course. It’s mega boring now. Hope Brock or Seth win
alpha male of OUR SPECIES……WHATTTT!!!🤣🤣
The Beast is back🤘🏽🔥
Always good to remember in real life Brock would kill that pretty boy In like 3 minutes.
I’m a Reigns fan… but this rivalry is old
Wait so the commentators can curse 3:52 😱😱😂😂😂
Jesus Lord AGAIN?😩😩😩😩🤦🏾‍♂️
Feel bad for the fans
Man this rivalry never ends. I’m tired of it now
Let's go BROCK!!!
I like Lesnar, but not this again…
I was there. It was amazing. None of us expected it!!! Place went wild!!
Still no bray huh not surprised
Brock….again 😐 they can only show the same match so many times.
I mean the crowd seems to love it no one expected him to come back this early
I knew someone was going to come out to interrupt Roman LMFAO just didn't think it was going to be Brock
God awful seen this match over and over riddle had a perfect opportunity for a push or literally build anyone else up to take the belt I would take anyone at this point besides the same “Cena, Brock, Randy” trifecta we get over and over with a sprinkle of no faces just randomly getting a shot to make the “unified titles” that much more prestigious
roman looks just speaks "i dont even wanna wrestle this dude no more"
This it's getting old
The only thing WWE has going for them. Brock Lesnar
Dude reminds me of Michael Myers
Your voice okay, Roman?
The smart move would have have Lesnar interfere with Drew and Roman Roman wins Brock fights Drew for the title again or triple threat
Everardo Kim Silva my team All Elite Wrestling Friday night smack down Monday night raw Tuesday night nxt 🤼 vs the Boodline
Bring out the hometown boy because they can't make new stars
Am I the only one who finds the Usos little knee sell so annoying?!?? Dude can’t sell a rko and he can’t sell a f5? Give me a break
At least now we know how Roman will lose at least one of the titles. There's no way they'll have Brock lose again.
We all sick of this feud now
Me: hey, Reigns is back from vacation...cool  WWE: hey, we having Roman fued with Brock Lesnar again   Me: *eyeroll*
I can name 30 wrestlers right now I would have been more happier to see make a return
Good to have the beast back.
Generic, unoriginal, and lazy. You guys could have created a mega star off of beating Roman but nope just to do the same thong over and over and over and over for almost literally a decade. Then have the nerve to complain that there aren't any superstars in the new talent as if it isn't your own fault for that. Drew, Finn, Edge, AJ,  and the list goes on of people that could have dethroned him but your poor writing has has lead you back to this. I hope with Vince being gone that whoever takes his place does a complete overhaul on the writing team.
The members of The Bloodline each getting well deserved F5's!...😊
Bruh🤦🏻‍♂️
Oh what a surprise Brock lesnar wwe sucks.
I quit
🥱🥱🥱🥱
🥱oh nooooo, it's Brock Lesnar.....😴😴😴😴😴😴
It's about time Brock Lesnar came back to WWE Smackdown.
Roman gotta gut now
That's the same guy who flipped onto his own neck  and his neck won
Again?
Brocks hometown tho 😷
🥱
Don’t ever shake Brocks hand
Nope. Still don't acknowledge.
They should give Brock a move called the retcon so he can readjust the WWE timeline to a time before it became a massive drag.
A Super Match That We Haven't Seen Yet , No Wait , Already Happened 😊
So are yall telling me no one in the Locker Room have proven their selves yet
Here comes the pain Roman
“How did Brock Lesnar get bigger ?” Pat your answer is as good as mine
Since Mainia 2015 to Now
Did the commentator just cuss after saying triple suplex city LOL
This Brock and Roman rivalry is getting so old🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
There gonna use this for the fiends return I hope
We already did the Jimmincky jillickers scene. It took 7 matches but we did it. It's done.
well it's Minnesota right where Brock Lesnar is originally from
BROCK U CAME BACK I KNEW U WOULD COME BACK
N for the 90th million time Brock vs Roman….whoopyy(in my most sarcastic tone)
I'm almost willing to bet that Seth will win mitb and cash in during Brock and reign match and will win the match since WWE likes to repeat stuff.
roman Reigns makes me sick
Brock is best for business 💪🏻
Yes the beast is here to take what is his
Brock Lesnar
Law of diminishing returns
did he just curse ?
They blocked commenting on the McMahon video so just discuss everything here. You're welcome!
Brock again? Geez Vinc...I mean Steph get with the times, give Roman new challenger, for once someone he hasn't already faced 20 times in the last 2 years 🤦🏻‍♂️
If they’re gonna recycle Brock they should just recycle Cens for another match
This is literally getting old
Brock vs Roman for the undisputed universal championship at SummerSlam you see in the past Seth Rollins won the money in the bank and at WrestleMania 31 he cash in and won the WWE championship he could do it again if this theory is true it will mind blown us all
Seeing Roman's heel work this past year or so, he should've been paired with Heyman long before now, dude is killing it!
BROCKS BACK LETS GOOOOOOI!!!!!💯💯💯💯💯
I mean….Roman already beat this dude so it’s kinda weird that Brock would come back like King shit…I’m so tired of them
Acknowledge the m f’n G.O.A.T
I miss when the champion wasn't elevated so high that no other match ups that made sense
Should’ve been Bobby against Roman honestly but 🤷🏾‍♂️
lets just keep repeating the same storyline and giving the titles to the two same people that don't even appear at WWE events 85% of the time
The hand shake into a F-5 go to see Brock lesnar back in wwe
Y'all need to just let Brock do him in go get someone else
SO I GUESS LASHLEY IS NEVER GOING TO GET A FARE CHANCE TO GET HIS TITLE BACK HUH?
Lashley
again?!!?!??!?! come on now
They should have loser leaves wwe match at summer slam for the tittles Brock would win and take the tittle but be nice and vacant the tittles
THE BEAST INCARNATE HAS RETURNED 😈😈😈😈😈💯
Bobby, Drew, AJ Styles, EDGE, Finn Balor so many people they have picked besides a part timer. WWE needs to try something new please
He’s fatter not bigger lol
How many times are we going to see Brock vs Roman? Like seriously WWE can watch those two go at it for years and won’t get bored of it 😂😂
I can't wait to see who will become the Undisputed Part Time Heavyweight Champion.
Yesssirr brockkk
Bruh. I could only imagine how it would be. If brock still had his UFC gimmick, And goes against this roman reigns.
All he did was come bck to lose again 😘😭😂
Brock sucks
WWE: Then, Now, Forever, Together, Brock vs Roman........................
Again?
They have to bring Bray Wyatt back…that would be epic
*Titan tron clearly says Brock Lesnar*   Michael Cole: Could it be? It is! It’s Brock Lesnar!  No Cole, we all thought it was Hornswaggle.   Cole should’ve been fired years ago.
He’s gonna get the money in the bank then come after him tbh thas wha I thinkk
Well bck to AEW BEEN STOPPED WATCHING WWE
Ho hum..nobody else
Reigns physique is trash
triple threat match , Cena Brock Reigns - Cena wins
Omg.. Cant you guys do something new???… that is why I stopped going to the events
Exactly how may times has Brock Lesnar returned
This feels like a re-run. Y'all can stop trolling now
He’s getting a lil flappy
Here we go again lol
Vince is in trouble….. UNLEASH THE BEAST !
Same schet  all the time fuket wwe
So let me guess brocks gonna win the money in the bank and riddles gonna beat roman soon and than brock will cash in on riddle lol
whats he think he is gonna do in real life after leaving? I don't see him being anything like his cousin who people rush to the box office for...  mistake on Romans part if he really is getting ready to leave for good like rumors suggest
Triple Threat match between Brock Lesnar vs Bobby  Lashley vs Roman Reigns for the undisputed title
Reigns has really put some size on compared to when him and lesnar first started feuding in 2015 lesnar was a lot bigger back then but now they look the same size
Again. Really. So no confidence in any other stars. Pathetic. Wwe doing their best to drive fans away to aew
Roman should’ve signed the NDA
I’m not trying to hate but I’m getting tired of this feud always Brock and Roman it’s getting boring
Vince McMahon "Together. Me & John did it Together" 😂
I love to hear people cry in the comments
Lesnar or Stroman the only ones that’ll beat Reigns . So I’m not upset they’re making ANOTHER story line for Lesnar vs Reigns.
Brock is wwe's panic button
Well this will be a snooze fest..... We might actually get the real finish Wrestlemania was suppose to have.
When in doubt bring Brock out😂
Creative: We ran out of ideas Vince: I already made the call Call: Brock comes back
*Roman gives speech how there’s no one left for him to beat and fight*  *Out comes brock lesnar who he’s fought 100 times and has beaten already multiple times*
Cool
I seriously never need to see another half assed Lesnar V Roman match. Their Mania match was horrendous. Their matches in 2021 were so boring. Mania 34 was one of the worst main events.   Mania 31 was a great match… why can they not do anything even close to that again?
U get goosebumps for moments like this
If we are really doing Roman and Brock again, please make it special. Do something to make it mean more than the last match
BROCK LESNER OMG WHAT A SHOCK Im sorry but can we please get somthing different, I don't hate the matches but it just happens way to often
Does roman look like he gained weight?
Brock will Dethrone "The Tribal Chief"! 😂😂🤣🤣
Roman vs Brock is the new Cena vs Orton nobody wants to see it anymore but they can’t come up with any other stars
Pat creams himself everytime brock comes
The only people that say they hate lesner coming back over and over aren't really mad they just say they are to get attention..
Cowboy Brock
TLC 2023 Brock, Riddle, Randy v the usos and Roman for the championship
Letssss goooooo Brock get yo title back tag team match with rk bro and brock vs the Usos and the tribal chief
Eye roll
I turned it off right as The Bloodline went to leave the ring. I missed it live.
Sami uso was right there. Would be 100x better than roman vs brock
I guess rhodes orton out they bring lesnar
Bro Brock loss 2 times already just leave
Riddle and Lesnar vs The Bloodline at MITB
Again??..boring
You part time fans are funny. Acting like Brock has been off tv for like a year haha he was just at Mania and very active leading up. Go watch AEW and if you're lucky you'll get to see who you tune in for, but with the enormous amount of bodies on the roster probably not. But hey, you'll get to see the Bucks if that's your thing
When is Roman Reigns going to face Sheamus
The Usos selling the F5 like Hulk Hogan used to sell finishers for others.
☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽
How many times has this dude "returned" in the last 2 decades? Returns more than he appears. These "surprise" returns are getting stale
Now that Vince is gone they won’t push Roman no more lol
If you listen carefully, you can hear the crowd chant “this again, this again, this again”
Roman didn’t learn from Cena.
Brock still got his Championship rematch tho
Brock will be 90 years old and still saving Vince's 120 year old butt
F5 on bloodline
Wow what a surprise. Instead of building up someone new, let’s bring Brock Lesnar back again and he’ll get a title match again. Maybe we should just fire every other male superstar on the roster?
Why do they keep trying to portray Lesnar as this beast when he loses pretty consistently
they have to get the belt off reigns and no one else is built up enough to do it
It’s cool they brought him back ironically in his hometown!!!
Lmao get ready for another pointless mainevent this time Brock wins and Roman leaves  6 months later roman comes back 🤣🤣 to face Brock and wins
Brocke again… seriously ??? U don’t have anyone else on the roster ? Oh yah all the heavy hitters have gone to greener pastures . The winner of Seth and Cody’s fued deserves a shot . If we get another year of Brock and Roman , i truly will give up on WWE
PZ9 the best fighter vs project Zorgo
Same ole same ole
Imagine Cena enters and wins money in the bank?
Pat macafee commentating is the best since J.R and King
This face brock is literally as epic as heel reigns!!!
again…
Así es bueno el traidor gallina asada
Great 😒😒😒😒😒😒😒
Same ol same ol
Roman Reins looks like he got real comfortable in his position and put on some weight. This also could be a publicity stunt to divert what's going on with Vince  McMahon and the allegation. J/S!
He's never beaten brock legitally though, always had help
Great moments brock 💥
Minnesotas OWN!!!!!!
Pat McAfee is gold
C'mon.....its comical at this point. NOBODY wants to see this feud yet again
Can Brock f’in win this time?
Lmao I don’t see how this still going on.. it’s BORING !!!!! Like u guys running out of Things to do !??
Roman picking up some weight
NFN but .. CHUBBs McGee needs to put on a shirt
I have a theory... if somehow Seth.. hear me out, hear me out.. Seth Rollins wins the MITB he prob cashing in Roman at Summerslam. Yk like he did in WrestleMania. Cuz idk, i still don't see Drew or Sheamus or Omos(jk) as a champion near in the future for now
He always does this
He’s going back to the hard heel
Now, this was one of those big moments. Brock didn't just come back, he made a non-verbal statement. 🤙🏽🚫🧢
Again????? BORING!!!!!!!!!!!
Imagine this, if WWE worked with AEW and they had a crossover show.  Jon Moxley vs Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins vs Kenny Omega, and FTR vs The Usos.
I figured it out. The Vince scandal was set up so people wouldn’t be upset that Brock is randomly returning probably due to the orton injury.   Boom nailed it
then john cena’s gonna return too and maybe wanna title rematch again…. a triple threat?
I thought that Reigns was supposed to be gone for the whole summer lmao what a bunch of croc. 😆🙄 also why does his voice sound completely different?
Don't complain about AEW(better product) when this is what we have gotten since 2016 pretty much 😂 Brock vs reigns for the 200 time
He already SMASH Lesnar. Oh well ROMAN will smash him again and again. ACKNOWLEDGE THAT☝️☝️☝️
Just hear me out...what if Brock started his own stable as well.   Make this staple into former amateur Wrestlers. Brock as the main Kurt Angle as the spokesman Shelton Benjamin Charlie Haas  I think this will be a great feud between now and maybe ending it at survivor series.
the way i pulled it out
Why tf were they hinting at Nakamura for a while, Brock again seriously?
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Yo Summerslam is like 40 days away. Too early to book the World Title matches. Add McIntyre or Cena to the match.
Wdym hes back? Lol wrestlmania was what 2 months ago
Edge vs bobby lashley if not Brock lesnar
1st John Cena coming back in 2 weeks then we get Brock Lesnar at the  end of smackdown 💪🏾💪🏾
THIS HAS BECOME THE NEW VERSION OF ORTON VS CENA SMH
This has already happened.  So what? Zzzzzzzz
Roman getting thick
Again.. this again. 🤦‍♂️
Again???
Roman is putting on a gut ever since he's been champion. He's definitely out of breath.
Brock for what ? So he can loose again
Finally wrestling worth watching!
Fox no one wants this fued at all. And this actually hurts to watch now
If these two match up one more time what I really want to see is a fair match with no outside interference from anyone...
Cmon bro I’m tired of Brock and Roman when Brock left don’t bring their rival back it’s just stupt
Roman is looking a little juiced. Gonna go from one part timer to another for the belts again? Guess Brock *is* more tolerable than Roman. Granted, it's not hard to be more tolerable than Lames 😂😂😂.
You ate full of ,,,,
When you run out of ideas. You recycle the old ones ♻️
Brock is my favorite of all time since 02 but this feud got old
It never gets old seeing Brock in the ring. Dude is such a freak athlete.
Imagine that.
Everyone stop complaining
I HATE IT..I HATE IT..I HATE IT Brock has only been gone "a couple of weeks" much too soon to come back..I didn't miss him yet Riddle should have won tonight..came out Monday with the strap put out an Open Challenge,destroyed who ever stepped up then Sammi Zayne put out the challenge for Smackdown beat Riddle and hand the title back to Reigns..yeah the Hogan Andre DiBiase angle with a different twist Don't get me wrong I like Lesner but I just don't want to see him...YET
The bloodline forgot they was in Minneapolis Minnesota🤦😂😂
I can see Reigns vs Brock but this time it’s interrupted by the Money and the Bank winner 🤔 sounds familiar
Didn't know these two fought for the same company
Clearly they've run out of ideas
I love Brock I really do….. but I wish it was THE FIEND instead 😭😭😭
Well Brock does have a beef with the way Roman won the belt to begin with
Oh great this guys back... god im so tired of brock lesnar honestly, while I do think hes cool on the mic I find him EXTREMELY boring when he wrestles.
Whenever something goes wrong in WWE they call Brock
Kinda strange how when Brock was with Paul Heyman Brock would act the part as a UFC fighter but now when he is not with Paul he dresses like Cowboy brock
This Brock vs Reigns is getting kind of old now WWE, find someone else
I mean..the mystique is kinda gone.  This Roman beat this Brock at Mania clean with a busted shoulder.
Roman: There’s no one left……  Yea cause WWE keeps firing everyone
Again! Smh
Omg this sucks brock lesnar came back to lose again
Not again man…ugh
I heard the match is going to be a last man standing with that possibility then I can see the match being a Controversial draw where reigns would lost one of the titles since he works a lighter schedule now
Are they sure they wanna do this again--
Not really because it's going to be the exact same song and dance where Roman Reigns will come out victorious over him.  Roman was right, there isn't anybody left because he's beaten them all.
How many times are we going to see Brock Lesnar vs Roman Reigns?
Wonder how much Vince had to pay Lesnar to come back
I think this confirms Randy is not coming back till next year
Brock is back because He is Ortons replacement in the Orton vs Reigns match.
Roman letting go. He not cut up no more
Plan B....the B stands for Brock
I think they would have put Cody over on Reigns but since he got injured...
Is it me, does Brock look like he is defined as usual?
Blocks a BMF....
Wwe don’t know how to build new stars anymore we just keep getting the same feud because there is no star baby face to take a built from Roman since Cody out
Smh...here we go again
Roman getting a little belly since he hasn’t been on tv much. Lol
Holy Canoli
This is pretty pointless unless you plan on having Brock win this time
Brock looks 270 at most now. You can tell he’s not in the gym like he once was and off the juice. Old Brock looked ever bit of 295 he was listed at. This Brock is smaller then Roman.
They only brought Brock back so he can take both championships while Roman is gone for 2 months
pat McAfee is hilarious 😂
Love me some Brock at this point. That boy is Good
Boring
Romans getting flabby lmao. Roman was juiced to the gills
garbage lol
I rather watch Family Guy then this feud
This feud just won’t go away
Brock still won't win. Roman won't lose tell after next year's wrestlemania. It's a great storie line, but brock still won't win. Drew and roman will still fight at the UK paper view in September for the titles.
Retire Roman, then you don't have to face Brock ever again..
Pat Macafee is GOLD
People complain but that reaction says otherwise.  If he was anywhere else that reaction would be the same even louder in the wrestling cities. So it’s not the hometown it’s Brock being Brock  Complain all we want but there’s truly no one left
I'm just going to say it because most people are thinking this, why, just why. Brock is a certified Hall of Famer no doubt but seriously? I'm genuinely surprised he didn't arrive to thunderous boos or even a silent arena. Pull a wild card, NXT call up (to save them from that hellhole known as 2.0). I know that'd seem weird to put a NXT star immediately in the main event slot but, THAT would be surprising and interesting, gives the person in question a chance to prove themselves to a wider audience.   TLDR: Boring, mundane, same old tired shtick, bad creative, unsurprising. Save a soul from NXT to be the next challenger.   Opinionated rant over.
Stop doing the same old matches wwe
They should bring back Goldberg as well and have Brock and Goldberg challenge for the tag titles. They would be unstoppable
Finally a fresh match up yay!!!!
When will Brock attack Paul Heyman?
Romain looks like he needs to lay off the cup cakes...
Never seen this before
If Brock had of waited untill after Money In The Bank, what woulda happened? A new champion? Maybe it could still happen?
Brock sucks that’s y he left UFC
Brock actually slimmed down slightly
This would be more enjoyable if pat wasn't doing commentary
Cena and Brock Lesnar return...😂
Oh God..also...I dont think Vimce wrote the show tonight..this was actually enjoyable except Corbins promo...bruh wth was that
Yawn another same story line
Looks like reigns is off his cycle.
Same old matches again and again
Shocking yet another Roman and Brock feud
Wwe creatives fast we need new ideas 💡?? Anyone random guy. What about lesnar again for the never ends rematch 🙄🙄🙄
HAHAHHAHA SUPLEX CITY ROMAN IM NOT GONNA ACKNOWLEDGE U
This is what happens when you don't create new stars...the only "guy" in the future will be Austin Theory.
It's old McDonald! 1:24
John cena finna come back and win one more championship
Bro. We would of been fine with Bobby Lashley instead
Garbage in garbage out. Reigns holdimg the nelt this lomg is a joke. With no punch line and it's offensive
Again really?
Just another boring feud between Roman and Brock boring
See how Paul went out the ring soo fast? He know wassup.
All these releases are coming back to bite WWE. Having restort to part-timers because your talent pool of wrestlers are currently injured or released from the company.
Bringing Brock back is a clear indictment on WWE failure to push other talent.
ENOUGH WITH THIS MATCH ALREADY. This terrible rivalry keeps coming back more times than Jason Voorhees. 🤦‍♂️
...It's like we're stuck in some kind of time loop.
We gon ignore the absolute hilarity of the commentator
“*insert wrestler* has just seen a ghost!” Got old 20 years ago, can we bury that quote forever?
“It's gonna put some butts in the seats” - Tony Khan, probably.
*yawn* Give Roman someone new.
Yesss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I was wanting riddle to win soo badly. I guess with Orton on the shelf, they had to call Brock to come back. This is getting so old. I'm over reigns and the usos. This was ok at first, but now, it's just boring
NOOO!! Find sumthin new!
This again...come on WWE this is repetitive. Make new stars, tired of the same ol shhhh...whats next bring back John Cena.
Omfg😒
i could watch this  all day f5's
BROCK IS AWESOME when he wears his cowboy hat
I really hope they don't do another Reigns vs Lesnar, they've got to be getting close to Cena vs Orton level of matches
Lol how dumb was Roman reigns when he saw Brock Lesnar to shake his hand, and got deliver a F5 in the middle of the ring
Soooo the bloodline think they can just come to that man home state and not get wrecked. This must be the big match for Money in the bank or possibly summer slam??!!
Roman's teeth look ridiculous
If we get Lesnar vs. Reigns at SummerSlam hearing it's a Last Man Standing match if so how can I get that classic Burn It down cash in when Seth Rollins Pulls The Repeat Highjacking if the Century
Why? Just why? We’ve had Brock vs Roman for the past 3 years already. I can’t wait for Roman to go away. That guy is the worst thing that’s ever happened with WWE. At least Cena made sense as the head guy. Reigns just doesn’t stand out as THE guy
Orton is next to mess with Roman & Usos  Just wait a bit lmfao
WWE cut the comments off on the Vince McMahon video 😂😂
Seriously.... they need some NEW storylines.....
Brock came out and said acknowledge Me!!!
ROMAN AND THE USOs ARE ABSOLUTELY UNBEATABLE NO MATTER WHAT! EVEN AGAINST BROCK! 💯💯💯
Dude go we don’t need you🤣
With Cody gone they had no choice. Brock gets ratings and you have to do what you have to do!
If only he WOULD leave
The BEAST. Take them all from those tards.
I saw that one coming a mile away
Bro 😐
3:24 he really fell for it😂
Just kuz money in the back is in Vegas. That's why this is happening.
Brock move like a beast
Whoever takes the titles from roman is gonna be huge
Woah new rivalry
Seth rollins is Roman's kryptonite if anything ,brock is just here to soften roman up
Only Brock. Can make a old fan love wrestling again
Wonder y the Vince segment disabled comments 🤔
woah its not like ive never seen this before
Roman got fat Brock need to take both his titles for sure and the ozos
Roman gained some weight.
How many times will Brock lesnar “randomly” returns and automatically get a chance for the titles? Also how many more times will he get the chance to win it? It’s literally the same storyline OVER AND OVER!
"There's no one left."   Yeah, because WWE spent nearly a decade putting all their eggs in the Roman Reigns basket trying to get him unanimously over. Meanwhile, the rest of the roster starved. Like a bunch of Charmeleons sitting in your PC who will never get the chance to evolve into Charizards.
RR: I didn't think you had it in ya BL: I'm your huckleberry
They're in his home state, so yeah lol
A dream match we never thought we would ge…Never mind.
¿Has anyone noticed they did something to Brock's theme song? Its slowed down and low pitched. His 2002 one wasn't even like the one from this clip.
Since Randy is out indefinitely. They are just gonna make roman beat Brock again.
It's up to Lesnar to save the WWE
Roman is right:there’s no one left from him and that’s a major problem for WWE. He’s already beaten Lesnar before so why wrestle him again?
Honestly WWE sucks. We all know Brock ain’t winning. No reason to watch this garbage live.
RR looks severely out of shape
No offense Roman looks a little flabby
You cheat on all your matches
Lesnar #1 badass.
Wait a minute.... is this Smackdown or Summerslam I'm watching???
Omg yesssss BROCK FREAKING LESNAR 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
When ever Brocks music hits it always feels like a return to me the beast is back🔥🔥🔥
Reigns fell for the oldest trick in the book 📖
Nononononon fuxxxxxxxxxk
The pop was freaking insane
☝️Acknowledge the alpha Male of our species Brock Lesnar
Should of been Batista
Man I wanted riddle to win because of a Brock distraction
has Brock shrunk or Reigns gotten bigger?
Bros getting chubby 😹😹😹
Is it just me or did roman gain some weight on his vacay.
Bring Borck back all ya want. We're still gonna ask about Vince and care more about that. No hiding your skeletons now.
LOL. Brock Lesner winning. No. He just playing games.........he wrestles Roman will lose as usually.........need to wrestle Bobby Lashley that would be a better match. Lessner back to collect a check get the fans excited and lose.........
Well, we know whose gonna be the next champion once Roman leaves
I've been watching wrestling since the 70s and this guy is a reason I quit watching it come on let somebody else have the belt
That pop to
Brock looks a little sick … he lost a lot weight
Brock vs Roman for the 100,000,000 time
What about drew
This time Brock lesnar wins the titles
I mean we don’t got Cody. We don’t got Randy. Every other big name is focused on other stuff. Brock seems to be the only option to keep Roman busy. This isn’t going to be the main focus, just time filler. Hang in there, friends! At least we get to see the Mayor of Suplex City again!
They just have no idea how redundant all of this is becoming. I mean how many more times are we gonna watch these two fight. I just wish they actually put effort into their product.
Roman Vs Brock part 11 , wwe Stan’s can’t wait to see it
Don't know is the ufc champion iz. Buhh Roman n Brock. Gud entertainment...
OH MY GOD ITS LIKE FINALLY WHEN WERE GETTING NEW STARS LIKE RIDDLE AND CODY NOPE WHERES BROCKIE ITS TIME FOR PART 10 OF THE SAME EXACT MATCH
THIS IS GETTING OLD!!!
LETTTSSSSS GOOOOOO BROCK
It’s cool he’s back but this like like 10th time they’re gonna have a match it’s old af
If you had told me in 2015, that Roman Reigns would be the most interesting thing WWE has on tv, I would’ve said you’re out of your mind! But now it’s pretty much true and my head is shook still lol
I’m so sick of Brock vs Roman. Do something else. Please!
When in doubt book brock vs roman lol
Roman looks out of shape
Riegns looks a bit chubby here
We sick n tired of this lol! Boooooo lol
It's just funny now
Here we go again🙄😒😑🥱😴
Finally, a matchup I've NEEEEEEEVER seen before
Ok with that voice man I thought it was Jason Mamoa XD swear man XD might be a meme but.....I mean COME ON XD
This storyline has gotten very old and boring.
Crazy how we go from hating Brock loving reigns to loving brocl hatin reigns
🧒👏👏👏
IM TIRED OF THIS BULL EVERY TIME ITS BROCK USE DWAYNE  OR EDGE GOD DANG IF I SEE BROCK SMUG MOXLEY DUM BUT AGAIN IMA BREAK MY PS5 AND AIRPODS AND MY NEW IPHONE 13 FRICK
Riddle gots to help Brock with the uso
No one left??? What about Drew? Sheamus? Shinksuke??? AJ??? Roman hasn't beaten everyone yet
Make kofi Kingston great again
Yea WWE don’t know what to do at this point. 😂😂😂
BROCK IS BACK LET......GO
Brock is back because romain signed a deal for less appearances and they realized they messed up taking the belt off brock and unifying them when romain won't do the appearances they thought he would. Lesnar is going to beat reigns for the raw championship
all over again, we just saw this now they doing it again.
so one man wrecked all the top champions in one go
roman slowly becoming rakishi
Bruh I’m tired of Brock already
Bloated Brock is back ✊🏾
Sad that WWE can’t get new upcoming wrestler up
Shi......... Wat iz going on.
COWBOY LESNAR IS BACK, BABY 😂
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
And this is what happens when you draft everybody to raw the third time were saying Lesnar and Roman fought ever since Roman turned heel fourth if the day 1 match would have happened
Nobody gonna talk about the fact Roman look like he been acknowledging some cheeseburgers…..
Not agaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiin!!!!!!!!
Roman is probably going to win again at Summerslam
I'm tired of Brock Lesnar how many times are u going to get yo as kick let somebody else get a chance
Brock kick some butts Do anybody see Mr Kennedy in the arena since he is from there
Well here’s goes this rivalry again
Brock is gonna take back what’s his
Minnesota's home town beast is here. Pandemonium
Hellbyea I'm excited now more reason to go to summer slam not just that it's in my home state of Tennessee this year right down in Nashville at the titans stadium.
Lashley,drew,orton(if not injured),etc
When in doubt bring back
Let’s go so happy just not for roman
Again with this?
Lol 30 seconds of Vince.  Knew it wouldn't be news.
when roman went to shake brock's hand i said to myself didn't do it it's a trick he's trying to trick you. you're going to get an f-5 i was hoping that i was wrong here but i knew that i wasn't. the wwe sure is predictable and you can usually guess what their going to do like 90% percent of the time. it's like even when the wwe tries not to be predictable it's still "predictable" and you can guess what their going to do. the wwe need to try harder to make what their going to do less obvious it's still a good segment and confrontation i still like the show though.👍👍👍👍
Never get tired of hearing Pat saying Brock is the “Alpha Male of our Species” 😭😭
I enjoyed it better when you was gone and look up and see you again not no more Brock Lesnar I am gone until you leave again I don't want to see you hear from you look at you or hear from you no dealings or associations with you I never knew you depart from me.
It looks like the WWE gave me a reason to watch them again.
Lame.
This is what 5 million dollars gets you.
they have other people that would good be if they made the story good.
For the love of god have Brock win at summer slam
And the fans keep cheering I would’ve walked out tired of this WWE please! He’ll let Seth Rollins challenge we’ve seen it before but it’ll be fresh
No.
now we continue this fued with 2 part timers xD
THE BEAST BROCK LESNAR IS BACK FOR HIS GOLD
Brock is the next Goldberg
Here we go 😬
Cry Roman rings welcome back beast
Lemme guess, they are gonna have Roman put the WWE championship on the line and have him lose that but have him keep the Universal title?!
Riddle winning is exactly what would make wwe worth watching again.
Roman sucks sucks sucks
All y'all complaining still clicked on the vid wasting your time and comments for them to get more views 😂😂 America!!
I am so sick of brock lesnar getting another shot. He’s had several chances and fallen short each time. Move on with this wwe.
Bro can we stop with this already. It's player out already, let Brock fight someone else or retire if there's no one else besides Roman for him to go against
I mean, if they have Roman go over every time what's the point?
Why do people like Brock so much like he’s the same as Goldberg in taking away opportunities from superstars who actually deserve it of course it’s fun to see him from time and time but it’s always for a title shot which he didn’t earn
Good now y'all can make a better match this time
Ah well, was hoping he wouldn't come back. Time to avoid wwe for awhile again. I'll just keep up with the news on social media sites.
This company is a joke from repeat matches to the owner having an affair o and fans just love repeat trash.
When is wwe gonna relize we are tired of seeing Brock Lesnar , it’s the Roman reigns era
No Chris Benoit?
Was Bobby unavailable?
The last match they had was awful. We really needed this again?
Wrestling is so silly 😂
Roman looks like he hasn’t been working out
Well, Brock's making money I guess...
Imagine if Brock never left WWE… he would be in the WWE Hall of Fame quicker.
Roman Regins (c) vs. Brock Lesnar for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship at MONEY IN THE BANK (2022) NOW THAT'S WILL BE STUPENDOUS!!! ✊ 🔥✊ 🔥
Our Lord and save your has return
It kinda makes sense why they’re bringing back Brock Lesnar, before Roman reigns always lost to him and not it’s reversed so maybe we might see Brock win the title back
Made sense Brock is from Minnesota
Squirrel!!  I mean, Brock!!
OMG, seriously WWE how many times do we have to see this bloody match?
These two will surpass Cena vs Orton in matches mark my words
I love you brock 💙
Triple threat match cena vs reigns vs lesnar but theory got cena
Roman Reigns Congratulations New Universal champion Riddle You Not Champ Don't not Congrats to you THE USOS I gonna Do Well Attack you Over Never Again
I don't like Brock Lesnar good bye wwe if he is coming back I am gone I would rather see Cena vs.reigns
this again.....wwe u are so lame
Oh dear God not again.!!!!
Romans is the greatest champ off all time! Even if Brock wins, Roman beat him so many times! People know Reigns signed a new a contract to make less appearances causing the WWE to possibly place the belts on someone else! Basically Roman is giving up the championship on his own terms!
Next week Goldberg comes back and does the same to Roman.. Then we get a Triple Threat I Quit/Inferno match
Nice. Glad to see him back. With reigns about to take a much needed break, Brock is suitable to carry the title for a while as long as he isnt part time.
Can we stop bringing Brock back to get his title shot against roman? Give us little Jimmy the title he deserve.
Brock is back baby
C'mon people.  They were in Minnesota, of course Lesnar was gonna return.  He's a legend in that state.
Would have been better if it was the fiend
Wow, this sucks lol. Even after 8 years nothing changes. I shouldn’t be surprised.
We're doing this AGAIN?!?!?!?!
Bro we don’t need this match anymore. If Brock wins he’s still going to be a part timer. And it’s going to be the same thing. Suplex, Superman Punch, Spear, F-5 and match over. This is a waste
No Brock got smaller 😂😂😂😂
Brock is back! I think Paul Heyman going to turn on Roman for Brock. Do you all agree?
Ladies and gentlemen we might get a John cena return at summer slam for when Brock and reigns fights
I’m glad Brock is back but I do to to see him face Roman again
Same old s*it
Brock need to retire... this getting old same story line 😪
3:27 3:37 3:43 *F5*  I am so happy to see Brock Lesnar return to SmackDown!!  NOW THAT'S STUPENDOUS!!! 🤠 ✊ 🔥
Reigns Lenser Summerslam… have Heyman and the Usos banned from ringside
I don’t care what people say, this rivalry never gets old. I feel like every time they clash it’s like a sequel of a movie that adds more and more layers. From this it probably builds the McIntyre and other match up’s. Remember also rumor has it Roman is leaving so maybe it’s a time travel for Roman like going back to how he was before and after. It’s good to have a open mind.
Roman Reigns once again has taken a turn down to SUPLEX CITY. I know a lot of people hate it, but I just love Cowboy Brock.
Lets C here so Roman Reigns threatened 2 leave wwe if he lost to John Cena at Summerslam. But will continue 2 keep giving his worst enemy Brock Lesnar rematches. Yea Roman definitely is “not scared” of John Cena.
I saw the f5 from a mile away when he stuck his hand out lol
Boooo something new
imagine being excited about this again
Yes happy to see Brock back but the look on Roman face is priceless and look at Summerslam  Brock is coming to take the titles from him!!!
Give Seth Rollins The MITB So he can Take the Titles or something! Love Brock and Love Roman but it's time
WWE's last resort: Brock Lesnar!
This dude Brock look stupid
This just plan ridiculous I am so tired of this🤬🤬
As much as I really liked the Brock and Roman fued, this has gotten stale. But then again it's WWE so it's not very surprising that they're doing this again
oh look, Brock vs Roman for the 103,346th time, how exciting!
Oh come on. There are plenty of names they could've really gone with, this is just lazy, and I bet you, that Broke "wins". So it will be the same old show and dance again. I'm sorry, but if that is the default now, WWE needs to change who is running it. Because it's heading towards The Ground City.
That clown reigns is an absolute nobody. He would have long since lost that title without the assistance he gets over and over and over again from the uso douches.
Brock is becoming wwe new prostitute
In real fight Bobby Lashley would kill him
Roman sucks, oh look, a Superman punch, 0 wrestling skills, Brock either, Oh look, another F5
sounding like Razar Ramon lol
I have watched Brock Lesnar for many years and his most impressive years are now!
L by wwe
They found undertaker replacement
The plan was always to bring back Brock and have him beat Roman before his new contract kicked in. They just had to pull early cuz Orton got injured. Also, why aren't they building Drew to be a legitimate threat? He's the only other guy besides Brock and Lashley right now that can believable defeat Roman.
How many times he's coming back? lol
Give it up Brock! ITZ OVER!! We The Ones
Lord we have no one to Fill These voids. Drew, Sheamus, Any one could have showed up instead but nope let's recycle Brock vs Roman
Roman Jimmy and Jey got f5d by brock lesnar
Nobody wants to see these two fight again!! Smh
Brick will win Roman and the Usos will be released from there contracts. Roman is going to be in the new Hobbs and Shaw movie. Jimmy and Jay both has charges against them and both might face jail time.
Snoozer
Can't wait to see Brock get his belt back and kill the bloodline!
Minneapolis, acknowledge me!  ☝️☝️☝️☝️🎆🎆🎆🎆✨✨✨✨
What match will this be between them 20?
This has been an epic run for roman but it's time to get belt off him. He really has ran thru everybody. They bringing back brock because who else can he beat
TBH I wasn’t expecting Brock to come back for a long while
Brock again? 2022 needs a new Brock...
Sooooooo, two part timers fighting for the belts. Right..
Acknowledge That Roman 😎✌️
Oh time for the rematch already? aight cool!
What a joke  Brock...go Blood lines.
Brock Lesnar doesn't really need a championship, he seems just as legit without one. Undertaker and HBK were the same way.
Dawg not this again 🤦‍♀️
As funny as it would be to have brock win a belt from roman so that he doesn’t have to hold both, its not gonna happen. Orton was supposed to face Reigns at Summerslam but with him being out for the foreseeable future, we’re stuck with this again. Reigns is staying i defeated. Pro tip, build up Riddle to be a baby fave mega star, build it around “doing it for Randy” and let Riddle win the big one.
Bro I don't know who else can be Roman I don't even think Brock can beat him so I'm just going to said it Roman is the new final boss of WWE
!st time ever we've seen these 2 in the ring right?
Reigns getting fat
Roman reigns already beat Brock 🤣🤣🤣
Why bring brock back again
🤦🏽
Yyyyyyyyyyyyyy? This what happens when no new talent is pushed. Smh. With everything going on now, This is the time for WWE to get new fresh ideas & push new talent. This same ol same ol is redundant.
i personally wouldve rather seen someone else come back or a new star they wanna push... but Brock is Vince's go to guy so...
I'm really getting tired of the same
I could care less...underwhelming title reign no memorable storylines. now Lesnar vs reigns again. who cares. 😵😵😵
Roman reigns  acknowledged  him
Roman never wins at MITB. So he may lose to Brock then leave for Hollywood
Another Lesnar vs Roman storyline I’m just hear you comment y’all ain’t tired of this ?! This is ridiculous exactly why I stopped watching
Go get your title back brock!!!!!  Suplex City!!!
they just recycle the SummerSlam ‘21 ending to tonight’s Smackdown.  Boring!!!
“How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man”
OUR Tribal Chief
Brock is not aging well at least compared to Lashley did he stop working out
Finally real wrestler show up and attacks they scumbags
Omfg, rinse and repeat rinse and repeat rinse and repeat, WHY do people keep watching this garbage
The beast is back
I swear these matches are similar to John Cena versus Randy Orton all over again
Stop
YES Brock is back
Pat cussed? Lol
Maybe just one more time... The match of a lifetime again.
Brock making roman look small
I'm sad he didn't break Pat's table again
😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
And again...
So fans were complaining about No more brock vs Roman but when brock showed up everyone was excited!? Lol
If they get tired of OG Roman only Brock or Cena can beat him
Again...
Again.
Enough is enough, it's time for roman to lose the belts and just go away for a while. His character is beyond stale and his run has gone on far longer then it should have. Idk why wwe has not tried to resign some of the talent that they have let go, like braun strowman and especially bray wyatt. I would love to see the fiend back in wwe, those belts would look alot better on him then on roman
That would be awesome if we got a Triple Threat Match between Roman Reigns, Brock Lesnar, and John Cena at Money In the Bank or Summerslam, Brock wants the WWE title back, John Cena wants a rematch for the title, and Roman is the champion, maybe it makes no sense but it does sound like a big match
Why people so mad about this like bro I bet y’all the ones that actually ever go to a Wwe show and be the loudest ones screaming for brock
Is it pitched lower?
Lolol the saga continues! When it is clear Vince is absolutely out of ideas.
Reigns gettin that donk like Rikishi
"Rinse N Reapeat".... !!!!  TOLD YA....!!!!! Recycle !!!!!!!
OMG I'm so excited for their 8th rematch!!
oh for f*ck's sake...
Again
The YES movement returns 🙌
The "alpha male" line has run its course. Should have been a one time thing.
Lol that pop he got tho
Againnnn
Dude can come back anytime he want to and gets his shot right away. This is just getting old.
The feud that never ends
If only they were smart enough to have used their wrestlers better. So many potential stars either not used or released
Should have done riddle vs Roman and Brock vs someone else for summerslam. It’s not like they have to sell ppvs anymore. I mean I don’t know if summerslam is in a stadium or not… but wherever it is, it’s not going to be a hot ticket, regardless of who’s on it.
Oh brother
How many more moments do you two get 😂
I mean, this is OK. But I think it would make more sense and probably even better for The Fiend to return.
YES YES YES!!!!!
Wwe doesn't know what to do anymore
Who are the commentators? Just layout and let the man walk down the aisle or come with something better than that lol
lol No same old program different day. Nothing original , just like Roman still with the belts . Need to push new talent and stop doing the same old thing with a small  group of talent.
this is how you compete against aew
Pat McAfee couldn't say it any better. He is the alpha male of our species 💪💯
Nah roman reigns rapes everyone and leaves
I Am calling it, at MITB it's Roman vs. Brock for the Undisputed WWE Universal Heavyweight Championship title!
Just when you thought Roman Reigns got too ride off in the sunset the Beast returns.
this story line of the bloodline sucks once again one faction has all the belts how freaking boring zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Vince ain’t learned ish lol 😂 and when it gets low Vince hits the same reset button lol 😆
This return kinda gave me a flashback of when Lesnar returned after years and was gonna handshake Cena only to F5 him.
He's never beaten Seth Rollins
reigns been eating some burgers
The Tribal Chief has forgotten that Minnesota is Brock Lesnar's territory!!!
Brock Lesnar and Roman reigns again?They're about to wear this out more than John Cena and Orton
Crock returns🙄
THIS IS SOOOOOOOO LAZY @WWE!!!!
can we get anyone other than brock for once seriously go away
I was really hoping for the fiend
not trynna be that one complainer or anything but id rather see roman take on mörbius before I see another leaner vs roman match
Didn't he beat Brock at Wrestlemania?  Why is this even news?
Meh.  Same old thing.  How long will he be there this time? A month, month and a half?
Randy Orton, Drew, Jimmy, Kofi, Xavier, boi there’s still many people😂
nobody wants to see this again
I’m so tired of seeing them brawl. Reigns needs to drop the titles and I actually wanted riddle to take him out.
For will....????😳😳 How did i miss something like that.?🤣🤣🤣
Everytime Brock Lesnar comes back I cry a little on the inside. Dude is a god killer.
And roman is still boring.
Now we gonna see brock vs roman again smh. They could've put roman vs bobby lashley at summerslam instead of lashley going after the us title
Junk so awful
Desperate times calls for desperate measures
Please not again. Who cares at this point really
It’s boilin’ in here
I wonder how that investigation going on with Vince McMahon now he stepped down
Predictable. Brock’s backyard.
This would've been awesome to be at live considering I live in Minnesota
I can see why Roman is frustrated with creative
Wwe called Brock we need you 😂
Brockkkkkk Lesnarrrrr!!!!!
Why does Roman look like he been eating hella twinkies lol
3 f5s lol gotta love it
Told you that it would be the same outcome as every other title match with Roman. BLAND AF
It’s not that big of a deal to have Roman vs Brock at Summerslam
Well, there goes the hopes of Cody or Drew dethroning Roman
Not interested in seeing this again quite frankly...Roman has nothing to prove against Lesnar been there beat that
So i can comment on this one but not the vince video
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...........
Boooooorriiing he's old news he shouldn't be part of wwe anymore at least not involved in any matches been there seen that its old
Brock Lesnar will get revenge on Roman reigns
Lesson number 1: NEVER shake brocks hand
How many times these niggas going to fight
He’s baaaaaaack
It’s the same thing over and over
i was waiting for him to come back after what happened at WrestleMania
brock vs roman. This is annoying lol.
Farmer Brock back to claim what's his and stomp his boots into the tribal chief's behind along with the rest of the bloodline.
Hopefully orton returns healthy
Why should the people care about a guy who lost at Mania already to Roman?
BRO SOMETHING WAS TELLING ME TO GO!!!!
Oh my god how many times are we gonna see this fued
Who knew using one character over and over again could be considered "creative"
Could have been the All Mighty, but I think Lashley is waiting until after Summerslam
Yay the feud everyone wanted to be revived   YAAAAYYYY!!! 😒😒
No in my home town.
BORRRK LASEERRRRRRR!!!!!!!
This match again smh this is so disappointing we have seen this match 2 many times already man I'm not interested in this crappy feud
What would y’all had done if they would of shook hands and started laughing?  Then Brock opened his button up and the shirt under said “Beast at the foot of the table”?
Can we keep the shows going like this
I honestly was losing my mind, I got so hyped lmao
What month is it? They really have NOTHING else? Jesus Christ
Brock Lesnar next world champion
Favorite wwe Brock lesnar
I know Vince didn’t make this call 😂
Acknowledge that m f
Finally! A fresh feud!!!!
it sounded like brock's music was a bit different in tone
Just wait til Cody comes back
Man we've been waiting for him to come back in his back
I would have loved to see Sheamus to step up
This again....
I want to see the Street Profits take the tag titles
Lashley, Bray, Shamus, Drew, Elias,  Big E,  Cody,....this thing with Brock is getting extremely old!
I love Brock but come on really again how many times are we gonna see Brock Lesnar vs Roman Reigns, you know they are running out of ideas or trying to milk this feud as much as possible until Cody Rhodes comes back
Bruh. This is horrible
Welcome back Brock lesnar 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Never seen these 2 against each other in last 7 years. This is once in a lifetime.
Yes see see eeeeeesssssssszzx
I’m so disappointed we seen this multiple times in different years 2015 2018 2019 2021 2022 and now again in 2022 wwe need to build new stars but THE ONLY SUPERSTAR THERE BUILT IS AUSTIN THEORY AND GUNTHER AND THIS TRASH MADCAP MOSS WHO IS GOING TO GET RELEASED IN A FEW MORE WEEKS OR SO WWE IM LITERALLY NOT GOING TO WATCH MITB NOW BECAUSE OF THAT IM JUST GOING TO SEE PEOPLE REACTION TO MITB  L Vince McMahon I hope this case goes bad for you
Brock is just good for business
Look I am excited to see Brock don’t get me wrong I am super excited to see Brock but his Reign as Champion no not really look the person who needs to be Champion now is Drew McIntyre the reason he needs to be Champion now is because he is never been Champion in front the Crowd so I am super excited about Brock returning don’t get me wrong but Drew needs to be the Champion now maybe along the way we could potentially see a Lesnar v McIntyre 2 for the Championship but Drew needs to be the Champion now I am sorry Brock your my favorite Superstar ever but maybe perhaps let Someone else be the Champion and along the way you could face them you know like if Lesnar won back the championship he would be Champion for a long time and that wouldn’t be fair to Drew because he has been Champion but during Lockdown and i think now that the Crowd is back right Drew needs to have his moment that was taken 2 years to wait you know Brock as Champion now wouldn’t be fair for Drew you know Lesnar v McIntyre was in front of no one and Drew hated the fact that he won it in front of no one and so now is his time to shine Brock don’t send me to Suplex City maybe perhaps let McIntyre be Champion then you could face him again maybe perhaps Wrestlemania 39 because that would be insane to see you know
God this company is pathetic
So Brock wants the WWE title he can't take it oh I can see Paul turn on roman and he goes insane with revenge I am the double champion not you
YEEHAW the world greatest farmer is on back boys better settle up your horses because the beast is on the hunt
Brock comes back don't even have to have a match to qualify for a championship match to get one. He is another John Cena leave for a while come back and get a title match without even breaking a sweat to get it.
🤦🏽‍♂️ Again cmon this getting old now
For the love of god
They might as well give the US and IC titles to the Usos as this point
I HATE BROCK
Seven years later, and these two are still fighting
When I saw Brock Lesnar, I was shocked knowing they will do Brock Lesnar vs Roman Reigns at Summerslam, but what will make this moment a epic moment would be if Seth Cashed in
Bork laser!
So is brock getting jobbed again?
Hopefully who ever wins money in the bank they can cash in after roman and Brock fight again and take the belts away from them both
This rivalry between Roman and Brock ain’t over it ain’t over not by a long long shot
Hard to watch reruns.
I'm getting tried of seeing Brock. skipping the line and getting a title match.
So Brock Roman for the 50th time? Really?
Roman you better get better soon cuz Brock Lesnar need to be payback from you  Our undisputed universal defended raining champion
Cowboy brock is the best Brock and you can’t change my mind
It was a great show until Brock Lesnar came out stealing The Tribal Chief 👑 shine.  WWE don't repeat that rivalry... Give RR fresh meat 🍖🍖🍖. WWE was just becoming interesting 🤔  Austin Theory, The Almighty, Sheamus or Drew. Love Lesnar but dude...😴😴
Good luck to Mr Money in the Bank
Brock actually looks smaller
Brock will not make the same mistake
Brock is back Roman reigns vs Brock Lesnar again 👏👏
When The Man comes Around
I had to refresh and make sure it wasn't an old video. that should tell you how much they went against each other
I see a cash in coming at SummerSlam
It’s either Brock or Goldberg at this point smh
Again
Okay so something everyone should have already known would happen did... Riddle lost to Roman. Surprise. Glad to see Brock back though.
I love pat lol
Omg not Brock and Roman again...please!!!! We have to see this again?
There no one left really Bobby lashley ricochet Kevin Owens Gable Stevenson
WWE needs to develop more superstars
Brock wins
I think WWE backed themselves into a corner, who one the roster is believable to beat roman?  Who could do what Cena, Lesnar, Goldberg to name a few could not do. Sure Roman won by low blows or Uso but still
Should’ve brought up bron breaker or made drew the leader of the judgment day cmon something anything other than this Roman won already so many times since 2018
Another i love Brock Lesnar as a face i love him as a face
Ahh dang I had hope shinuske would get a shot next
Nobody wants to see these 2 wrestle again
So we potentially about to have two part-time champions...
L
And that's how you get the titles (title) off of Roman, gotta luv creative, we out of believable bodies..... ring, ring Brock are you available for a couple of months
We been watching this since 2015
People complain about how many time we get this match but do we not remember John Cena vs Randy Orton? Cena vs Edge? Lesnar vs Cena? Their matches defined an era. Just like Roman and Brock. Their defining their own era.🤷🏽‍♂️
Brock Lesnar come back, I’m very he’s come back , Brock come back for Roman, I don’t know if he going get chance to win Roman this time😂😂😂😅😂
This getting old now
He's already beaten Brock so many times though.
Roman reigns already beat Brock at mania Brock ain’t got nothing on Roman reigns he’s the greatest of all time greatest of the generation god mod greatness on a different level the one ☝️ Brock lesnar lost to Roman reigns at mania and if they had another match against each other he would loose again
Not again please 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
The Fraudline is overrated and not a draw and their merch sucks.
what are they doin with roman at this point its not goin anywhere and it’s gettin borin and repetitive. Very happy to see brock tho.
Here we go again with this rivalry when will it end
Summerslam was supposed to be reigns vs orton. Unfortunately due to Orton getting injured they needed a last minute replacement and since it is summerslam it had to be a huge name, of course. So we're stuck with brock again. It was either run it back with brock or cena probably.
Whenever they don’t know what to do they just bring out Brock lmao
If only Randy & Nakamura weren't injured 😂. They couldn't build someone else by SummerSlam huh, good ole stadium shows 🤷🏻‍♂️
I think its time for brock to get the w from roman
Can we not see this bs again
Well there's your SummerSlam main event folks.
We gotta stop wwe nobody wanna see Brock the farmer as champ again.Please give us new stuff💯
Yes
The Beast Brock Lesnar and The Head of The Table Roman Reigns will Have The Ultimate Clash at Summerslam 2022!! The Ultimate Main Event of Summerslam Ever!!!! Lesnar vs Reigns Last Man Standing Match FOR THE UNDISPUTED WWE UNIVERSAL CHAMPIONSHIP
Roman Reigns will defend his titles against Brock Lesnar at summerslam.
Really don’t care🤦🏽‍♂️for they match nomo
Brock again?
I mean like I don't mind Brock coming back but why ☠
I’m happy Brock is back but why do we need to see this match again?
Welcome Back Brock!!
Not again
Not really tbh
Are you happy to see Brock Lesnar return to SmackDown?
