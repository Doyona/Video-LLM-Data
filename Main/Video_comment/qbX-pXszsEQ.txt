im  13 and I realy liked it it is my favorite show of all time!!! can someone explain of my age why you hate Big Mouth?
as  someone who has watched all 8 seasons,  I can say with 100000% certainty that Big Mouth is trash and I love it. I love garbage
I hate the noise you used to censor words so so much.
i feel like big mouth definitely has some of it’s unnecessary and overdramatic scenes, but overall i it helped me understand my identity and my own body so i’m a bit grateful for that.
56 minutes is a long time to say yes.
I think that the point of the show isn’t to have a serious through line. I enjoyed the show a lot (not so much after S4) because I took each scene as it was. Maybe I am the one looking at it the wrong way, but it’s one of those shows you just don’t take super seriously. I saw each episode kind of as its own with some plot lines that spanned multiple episodes, but the lack of consistency in certain areas didn’t bother me otherwise. Essentially a good-time show with a message to take from each episode or plot line, but otherwise don’t dwell on the continuity.

40:06 a what [[clown around town]] now?
11:01
It was never bad, some episodes are, but the show stupid humour doesn't make you bored as other shows in the same category. What I like most about it (and its spin-off): it shows you the problems behind being a woman and a human in general

According to lore only the clients can see their own hormone monster but we'll... There are times this rule was broken
I stumbled upon Big mouth when there were only three seasons out and have been a fan since. For me, I always forget how violently gross this series is because I like it for emotional stuff. I like how they try to look into depression, anxiety, love, hate and everything else through kids’ eyes. Yes, they do it poorly most of the times, but when they nail it, they nail it and it makes the viewer (or just me) feel for the characters. The same goes for HR. The scene with old lady with dementia is so good that it makes me cry every time. And an episode about grief. The series and the writers have potential, but they lack consistency and understanding of what teenagers feel and how they act. I would suggest them to get a couple of child psychologists on the team to help them work in those flaws. But I still love the series, it’s good and interesting and, well, when I stumbled upon it I was still a teenager myself and it helped me understand quite a few things about growing up. Tone it down with the excessive gross humour and you’ll get a perfect series for teenagers to understand what’s going on with them. Because right now it feels like they’re going 70% for the shock value and only 30% for education
Big Mouth?  More like Big FAIL!! LOL
U Cool, Bud!
I NEED the song at 6:00 like what is this fucking banger
43:55 This is the only time where I actually don’t mind a repeated lesson because learning how to handle depression really does take just going through it repeatedly until you find things that actually work.

Ironic that he reviewed this ugly ass show when this is the first appearance of his new avatar
Someone doesn’t know how to have fun
You honestly just sound like too much of a baby for a show like this.
yes
YES!!
I used to watch big mouth while I was on acid the show seemed never ending
I'm 15 now and started watching this show before I even started puberty and so obviously I didn't get it but it was kinda educational and when I did finally get my period I knew the general idea of what would happen [my mum sucks at engaging with me so yes I learnt these things through tv shows] and I heavily relate to Jessie, she's one of the realest characters to me, especially with her parents divorcing and the recent season showing her falling down a weed addiction. The shows not at all perfect and I myself have some critiques on it but you can't deny that it's relatable and definitely provides comfort to teens, specifically the ones going through a rougher patch than most.
I started watching big mouth in middle school, and honestly, it’s a great show. It’s relatable and teaches pre-teens and kids about puberty, gender, sexuality, friendship, and tons of good lessons. I really enjoyed this show, and the characters and how they develop from comedy to very relatable characters! (atleast some of them)
11:03 SONIC RUSH SONG YEEEAAAAAH BABYY!!!!!
The biggest thing for me I dislike about this show is its art direction. Every single character is gross looking. Not to mention I am almost 30 and "coming of age" shows are just so cringey to me now. Not for me in the slightest. Ill stick to hate watching youtube videos about it.
Ill never get over the fact that inside job and q-force only has 1 season while something like bigmouth gets this many 😒
Wft!? 38:02
I was concerned I was a bit pedo to enjoy it
I actually enjoyed the first couple of seasons of big mouth. I was about 60 when it came out and maybe it was nostalgia or I just thought it was funny in a crude way like South Park but not nearly as good obviously.
18:02 theres one frame of the outro
Bro there not there
They joke about child puberty and make fun of it
NOW big mouth came to an end.. and that show has been with me while *I* went through puberty. I'm 19 now and I love that show so much. It's absurd and some lines and parts are actually funny. Some characters are very relatable or have very relatable characteristics like Jay or Jessi. To both I somehow do relate.  I get it that people are mad about other shows being cancelled but c'mon.. hating a whole show is just Bad- just hate the people that went through with it. Not the show.
Here in 2025, the show got nominated for an emmy award  *Picture of barrack obama giving himself a medal
Although it could be a way more well rounded show, no show has ever made me feel so seen and heard.  Also they got Lin-Manuel Miranda to sing about pubes, which is funny as hell
Do you know why I hate this show? I find it just creepy like I find out how much they focus on the kids sexuality like on how much they fuck things like they’re always so horny like that’s not what kids be like like Jesus Christ. I know they’re going through the puberty age and they have puberty monsters but they do other shit like we all were young teenagers who were going through puberty but the show is just ugly to look at. It looks like it just made out of some guy’s perverted mind. I fucking hate characters. I hate the parent. I fucking hate everybody in that show look this is coming from a guy who’s a Family Guy fan and they made some really shit episodes but you’ve never heard anybody say hey Family Guy has some ugly character characters because they tell you what happened to Stewie Griffin? How he got his head like the characters is fucking ugly and it’s fucking creepy.
It wouldn’t be so bad if it was written by 13 & 14-year-old kids, but the fact that it’s grown adults writing child characters to do some of this stuff seems a bit ick.
they cant see other people hormone monsters 99% of the time... that was made very clear
Yes, it's really bad, I wish it was cancelled after the first season but no they had to keep that hot garbage of a show going, It's art style is ugly and most of the jokes are either just unfunny or straight up gross and disgusting.
The show is just glorified cp but people dont notice that
It's the dumbest shit for12 year olds ever.
ur accent is killing me im sorry i heard big bertha instead of mouth
The phonk is the best part
It's shit
It's a leftists pedo wet dream
I genuinely thought Andrew was the protagonist until you said something
I love this show, I didn't even knew it gets so much hate 😂  For me is really relatable and even has some educational value in the way they explain some of the "process" of growing up. Also, overanalyzing (not overthinking) too much is not the way to watch this show... And I think that's what happens with a lot of people. If people don't share the same humour obviously this won't hit the same. But for me, I can relate so much with many of their situations 😅 I just love that.
25:16 were not gonna judge u man just tell us u smoked the giggle lettuce
7:40 hell in the last season it is revealed  that Caleb is pulling the pudd& Maury is his hormone monster😂
the issue isn't just that big mouth is hated, it's that netflix series that people do like and are well written often seem to be killed early
I like the show because you can learn a lot but also keeping good humor like you can’t learn about puberty in a funny way bye going to school. So I like it.
I used to watch big mouth during the quarantine all day, everyday when I was 12/13. I personally found it very relatable because I was a young teen trying to get used to my body. My favorite characters were Jessi and Missy.
Ok , I love big mouth , but I hated when Andrew got all creepy ,it made him completely unrelatable and ruined that aspect of the character, and knocked him down the totem pole for me so now Jessi is my fav character:)
Your voice is ABSURD. What the fuck kind of ugly accent is this? I have never heard anything like this where only 1 word out of every sentence is almost unintelligible Catalonian or some shit, but the rest is just like normal central Ohio lmao wtf. I must know
its just the art style that is unwatchable
in my honest opinion, big mouth is an animated series produced by netflix and originally created by world renowned comedian under the name of "John Mulaney" (I have never watched this show)
Nick Kroll face is so friggin disgusting
You lack the intelligence to appreciate this show.... More and the hormone monsters are metaphors for how hormones influence our thinking at those ages. Like the shame wizard, gratitoad, and anxiety mosquito, they're personifications of emotions/chemical influences onset by puberty. To spend a good 3rd of this video whining that Caleb seeing them (being a very funny joke about autism) shows me that you lack alot of emotional intelligence. When Nick asks Andrew and others if they have a hormone monster, they're not speaking literally, they're bonding over having hormones change them and their attitudes. This isn't meant to be taken so literally, people just need to grow out of their 5th grade literacy so we can have better videos than "wah I don't know what is being depicted in this story im too dumb to wrap my head around"... Do better, this is slop
I caught on and thought pretty quickly that hormone monsters can only be seen by the kids that have that specific one, I might be wrong here
Why the fuck do you say mouth like that? Are you doing a reference to the way the characters talk?
u could just say "i dont like lola" since the beginning and i wouldnt need to watch almost 1 hour of ur stupid video to know its $hïīTt
Its got to be one of the ugliest shows ever , fucking awful designs
I don't think people understand the premise of big mouth, it's not supposed to be a show with literal rules, if people can or cannot see the monsters it's not a rule, it's just how the writers think it's better for that moment, why is that so hard to understand?
Awwww man. I liked Inside Job. Didnt know it was canceled
The problem isn’t what the shows about. It’s the fact at some points it gets straight up disguising with the way it’s portrayed. Also it’s like you said the way they pick and choose stuff for plot convenience.
it has always been fucking awful
YES!!, YES IT IS!!
Here's my take on Big Mouth. It's very close to the border of being child porn with the constant showing of their genitals and watching them constantly hook up with one another or with inanimate objects.  Like why would they feel the need to animate a talking vagina on their middle school character? Where do we draw the line from this and CP? This is almost as bad as artists who age up children from cartoons/games to use them in their NSFW "art". That's NOT a good defense. The only difference is Big Mouth is not looking to sexualize those moments, but it's weird REGARDLESS.  South Park has shown the kids' genitalia but nowhere near as much, nor as detailed as Big Mouth. They also don't shove it in your face by keeping it on screen so long. Like how does 1 sit there and draw/animate a damn talking vagina KNOWING that it's going to belong to their underage character??? They have little to no boundaries and acknowledging how weird all this is in one of their episodes does NOT make it any better. They clearly know its disgusting but just dont care because its animated and meant to be taken as "edgy".  Its meant for adults but i've heard people, including you, saying how this is basically for teens. Whoever this was made for, they had such an easy task for a "coming of age" story and instead of doing something good with that concept, they decided to make a disgusting, over exaggerated show instead.
Deep state was canceled and this got another 4 seasons
0:54
Dude obviously the stories aren’t gonna be 1 to 1 they literally say that 😭😭 huge miss dude you’re taking comedy way too seriously calling the show bad like it’s not a cartoon
Short answer, yes. Long answer, yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssss
didnt even watch the video, short answer tho, yes. big mouth is REALLY That bad. adults playing kids moaning in a mic while jerking off to a cat clock
Bro needs a speech coach
I listen to a lot of adult cartoon vids, this was by far not only the WORST I've listened to, everything from the narrators speaking cadence to this little sh*t fest of trying to explain why a cartoon doesn't follow rules. Lazy, immature writing, opinions that are just nonsensical, and the first thumbs down I've ever left on a YouTube video. Literally sounds like a 6yr old fussing.
U forgot bababooey from the second episode 😂
Sorry but hig mouth is accurate. This is how kids are these days (coming from a 14 year old). Alot of us think we are grown so we act "grown" and don't do kid stuff, we think this because of the Internet we have access to EVERYTHING at our fingertips and we know so much stuff. I feel we are more in touch with our emotions and how to explore them because we can research and put definitions and words to them. And also about u saying a child wouldn't just yell at there mom out of nowhere... Sadly that's not true 😭
All the comments about people being upset that other shows got canceled, but this stayed are so right. But i also want to add that this show just got ridiculous after a couple seasons and lost any quality it had.
I’m only about 16 minutes in, and I can summarize this whole video in one sentence. “Man on the internet takes comedy series too seriously.” This is why I stopped subbing years ago.
I personally related deeply to especially Jesse, I found it crazy seeing a character go through similar struggles to me. it explains so many niche experiences that most people can relate to at least one thing. I think it’s important for childhood representation which is controversial and hard to pull off because of the suggestive things lots of kids have gone through at a young age., but would be inappropriate to mention in the media. Bigmouth did it in a humorous and respectful manner . Not using real kids to put in uncomfortable situations. I feel if I felt represented then lots of others would have too.
This has convinced me that Big Mouth is bad. But I still like it :/
Yes, I genuinely am bothered by this kid sex jokes and don’t find them to be an appealing thing to watch for long periods of time, one clever joke like that every once in a while is fine but at least I the earlier shows that’s soooo much of the humor
Yes, it is. Next.
I don’t like big mouth at all and there is probably a big reason for it. I don’t like over sexual stuff like it took me basically beating myself up to start watching Game of Thrones again and this show is early game of thrones times twenty while having that against it I just found the jokes not funny just bad cringy jokes
The shows alright my biggest pet peeve is how they constantly break the 4th wall to the point where it's just annoying and coach Steve is unfunny and I hate his voice
canny work out ur accent for the life of me mate. ya sound too irish to be amercian and too american to be irish lol
2:11 HE SAID THE J SLUR
The art is gross and disturbing, uses kids in suggestive and crazy sexual situations, doesn't matter how you break it down, that's walking a close line to a big scary word we all know
I hate ur accent so much
Well, i think 7 was the las one the are doing
I feel like it's important to be a teenager as your'e watching the show. Don't get me wrong the show is pretty awful but it helped me as an autistic teenage girl. I love Caleb and Jessie for that very reason but hate the other boys on the show because i can't find it relatable. The show is like packed with a lot of different people and that makes it partially really bad but also good. From a writing perspective this shi is a mess, but from a watching experience it is somewhat entertaining and funny at ttimes.
I mean, it is bad af xd I'm sorry dude, but this is just clickbaiting ar best
Wtf Nick is the main character? I always thought that Andrew was the main character because he has a more momorable, likable personallity and deeper family issues and a lot more screen time...
Even modern Roblox events are better than big mouth
I watched like 3 or 4 episodes, i had no idea nick was the main character, i thought andrew was
big möäüh
big mouth hate is forced.
You will be rlly happy with how the newest season handles smoking
yes, moving on.
I’ve been watching big mouth since I was like 14 and I feel like idk I feel like u guys really overreact about the topics in the show and the way they’re shown
big maith
no, it’s not. people will talk shit about it not even having watched it😭 i’m 16 years old and i’ve always absolutely loved it. it’s not for everyone, i know, and i can’t see anyone over the age of 18 liking it, but as a teenager let me just say it’s one of my faves. anyone who’s 12-18 years of age should totally give it a shot. #BigMouthSupremacy!!
I mean look at ur character
7:53 I feel like they decided to make Caleb work with Maury now to clear that up😂  personally, I think that maury is seen with too many boys in class (for example: Andrew, Caleb, jay, and nick)… I feel like it’s very unrealistic and I get that they wanted to go deeper in the other classmates lives, but if they really wanted to they could’ve just added other hormone monsters. Also when Andrew and missy were in the closet together, the whole Connie and missy thing was very unnecessary
Maybe if netflix didn’t keep doing blood sacrifices on their other shows even if its more successful than big mouth for no clear reason other than maybe keeping big mouth they would stop complaining.
Inside job was absolutely elite
the characters in big mouth are not supposed to be attractive as they are literally teenagers, its supposed to entertaining or educational not sexual or attractive liek the art style isnt supposed to be pretty looking
25:20 mabye you dont know cus altho this isnt great its the best rep i have seen
13:20 you are anoyed that we dont know who can and cant talke to stewi if he can or cant talk
11:00 i think your just overly cridacal and thats often used as an excuse your right all these problomes are probloms but there realy not that big a deal there all very ignorable
9:00 is when im makeing this sybau i love your content your cool but stfu its funny and its an engoyable show istg your alegec to fun
31:15 ironically, that is exactly how that conversation usually goes. At least that's what I had to do in highschool~
tl;dr: yes   Exercise is also literally  THE most effective way to combat depression backed up by hundreds of studies for decades so uh....it's weird you keep pointing out what a wAcKy idea that is. That's why so many of these crybaby slobs/gayers/Decepticons cry about it so much.
Stop  poping on my YouTube  recommendations fuck you big mouth is a good show just because you dont like it doesn't mean you get to throw shade fuck off
Im 2 years too late but the only thing i wanna say is that andrew didnt get a love bug bc Andrew was a perv and didnt really "like" missy as much as he lusted for her
Puberty affects EVERYONE. If you're "offended" by this show, then puberty offends you and you should be ashamed
I THINK the implication of having a monstress as a boy COULD be an attempt at implying they're trans, but I'm gonna be honest I desperately hope that this isn't the direct where this series goes (mid video) as I can only imagine how horribly they'd handle being trans...  ETA: I'm glad they handled the trans character okay, although I have seen some of my fellow trans folk who've watched the show say she's just written okay
You are pretty damn ignorant on the subject of depression for someone who keeps eluding to the idea you suffer from it yourself. Instead of baiting for the cheap empathy you don't deserve, why not actually look into the subject? Clinical Depression is something that can be caused by a wide variety of things initially and affect people very differently. A huge part of this is physiology. The majority of clinical Depression is the result of hormonal production imbalance, once again caused by varying factors. This is why a majority of the symptoms are commonly associated with lethargic behavior, lack of emotional drive, etc. if you are not producing the correct amount of certain hormones for the variety of situations you find yourself in each day, you can suffer a lack of energy, feelings of resistance to activities including ones you typically enjoy, and similar. This can cause that sadness directly as a lack of motivation, accomplishment etc. feeds culturally into anxiety, confusion, self loathing, nihilistic perspectives etc. again, physiology is a complex and very individuated thing not only for a person but also that person in certain points of their life and based on what's occuring in their life. That is why medication treatment is not a solution for everyone now even some of the same people throughout their lives. You need different amounts of varying hormones to get you through the day so just supplementing extra so you have more than that amount doesn't work. Your body also tends to treat and react to artificially introduced chemicals differently than ones it produces itself so you have factors like building a natural resistance or resilience to it. This is where exercise can actually help. Exercising can actually cause an increase in development of these types of hormones so regular exercise is something that can potentially help individuals suffering from clinical depression. Unlike how you seem to think of it, it isn't just being inherently emo. It's not a personality thing but a medical thing that affects your personality. The shrinking aspect actually IS very accurate for a lot of people. You aren't just distracted from your depression you dimwitted bigot. Having friends support you can help because it stimulates the production of the kind of energy supplying hormones you may be deficient in but it depends on the person for a few factors. It's honestly really hypocritical of you to call out Big mouth when you yourself are spreading some really offensive and harmful misinformation on the subject. What can happen is the "weight" of it feel like it's lesser or shrinking based on a multitude of factors like greater production during certain periods, less triggers like anxiety, etc. Many people will go through valleys and peaks with their depression such as with seasonal or situation triggered low points. It's always there but with treatment and stabilization you can reduce the felt impact of it during periods of your life.
4:12 OMG! I just notice that the art style of the show is based after him, like look at him, huge forehead, fish lips and ox eyed
10:18 Is that John Mullaney
gA 16:23
cool plok music
23:08 Well actually you have 3 if you don't count the thumb. 👍🏿
I haven't seen a single episode yet but after I heard that the show ended I had to watch this video because back in 2023 I just skipped this video because I didn't care about it but now that I watch it I understand all of the hate behind this show because He said Season 1 had bad writing, gross sexual scenes and sexual themes etc and as a Christian I feel like I should never ever give this.Show a chance because not only does it sound like a bad show but it sounds like something a christian should not watch Spokennoise and also the fact that even though I haven't seen the show i've seen clips of it and I agree with everyone when I say this show looks really bad. 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
19:21 WHAT!? 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
15:43 What the hell? Why would they sing such a sad line like that?
14:30 She yells at her mom and says she's the patriarchy? What the hell? 🤨
Naaaaaah season 4 is poopoo but I love the first 3 episodes
yes
I honestly like bigmouth. I get why theres a lot of hate but i think it's honestly kinds educational, in a weird way. Some things were things i really went through during puberty and after and giving these gross things more representation helps with it being more normal.  Then again sometimes they go just.. just a bit far
To be honest, I really enjoyed this show as a queer person. It really felt the most authentic about its representation and I felt really seen
As someone who started watching Big Mouth as a kid, I'm 100% sure it wasn't intended for adults. A younger audience would likely pick up on the messages from the show far more easily. things like shame wizard or other monsters can be easily linked to your emotions helping you learn  things in a new light.
big mourth
big mouth is the teen titans go of netflix
Big marth
Jewish pedophile show
Y cant this guy say mouth
okay this video is so annoying to watch.   the whole hormone monster thing is you not understanding the concept of them. they’re not visible to anyone else while they’re working with whichever kid it is, the only time caleb sees him is just part of the gag as he’s autistic and maurice is also his hormone monster it’s not supposed to be looked into it’s purely for the joke.  and in season 2 they can see eachothers monsters because they literally went to their dimension so of course they’ll be able to see them!
I just can't stand the art. The look of each character just looks gross.
In my opinion, it’s amazing show for teenagers but not adults, I’ve learned more from big mouth than I have sex Ed and I also think, a lot of these issues brought up are covered in the further seasons, aka, that’s why they kept getting new seasons, because the story and world building wasn’t finished
In my opinion, it’s amazing show for teenagers but not adults, I’ve learned more from big mouth than I have sex ed
0:34 putting boss baby when describing shows that get cancelled too early is pretty ironic
no its worse. id rather kms than watch big mouth
It's a show that can only be enjoyed by pedophiles, no one else is interested in children's sexuality, fucking disgusting.
You're asking WAY too many questions. The show ain't exactly a technical tour de force. It's a cartoon, and anything is possible in cartoons. You didn't need to look so deep into it  Oh. Are you saying big Marth? Big mithe? What the fuck are you saying? Because it definitely ain't 'big mouth'.
It's not just the fact that actually good shows got canceled before the first seasons even released, it's the poorly masked pedophilia just smothered all over the show
Yes I hated this show. My friend loved it.
Big Mouth was great, I was sad to see it end. Gave me South Park vibes, and South Park has been my favorite animated series for over a decade.
its like mr.pickles its not supposed to make sense its just a gag fr
39:53 this is either really bad writing or it's touching on the fact that as young teen you just sometimes randomly fall "in love" with your classmates for no good reason
I genuinely love big mouth
... I think that when you see him entirellu like te season 8 you recognice how fucked up is the fact manny people think that just for the first seasons, but alsonyou know the good and bad to review the show, by the way dammit i niss incognite job :( but yhea this end was.... Good :/
why do i have a feeling that the show was made by a jew edit: nvm i did my research it was in fact made by a jew
You need to do seasons 7 and 8
Big muyf
Relatable show
Also give inside job six dam season's
Omg people can't see each other's monsters it's a bit when they do and only peoples own current monster can be seen by them that's all dumb ass
Big marth
I always assumed the hormones monsters, depression kittys, love bugs ect was in there heads . Although idk why Maury left Andrew but adults also have hormone monster as we see in the spin off
rotten tomatoes is legit a trash rating site. just read the shrek reviews. the critics are legit so picky sometimes. it's only good for audience reviews. imdb is way better. imdb gives it a 7.8. still good but not nearly as crazy as the 95% as rt.
Absolutely love this show. Doesn't deserve all the hate it gets, which I didn't even know it got so much hate, but the internet is gonna internet I guess.
I really love this show, it thought me some incredibly imortant information, and thankfully it aired exactly when i was a teen, so it was perfect for me
How do we tell him there's a new season
The show could have been about anything, but they went well out of their way to continually depict children in extremely inappropriate circumstances. You can’t leave your kids alone with anyone who worked on this.
Wow cant believe you missunderstood the concept of hormone monsters and personification of emotions, soo much.
i love big marth
The first season was really funny and enjoyable but after that it just started to feel creepy
sims 4 ass show
It's been two years check again guys
i love Big Mouth.
At points i swear its the lumpy space princess narrating this video
i feel like Pen15 is a better version of Big Mouth
People want this to be considered child porn so bad which is a weird thing to want
Came here after the show officially ended, it was a wild ride. I felt uncomfortable and grossed out at times, but this show never failed to make me laugh. I’ll miss you Andrew, not you Nick.
I loved Big Mouth until it got gay
yes
2:23 no, its because some people believe that society as a whole should be held to a standard and PDF file shows dont belong in it.
How on earth are you not even mentioning the clear breakout STAR of the show LOLA!!!!!????
I really saw big mouth and human resources all time
Another season IM SO STOKED HAAHAH
Please redo this, the ending was horrible!  This is coming from a fan who grew up alongside the show
Big bang theory 14:23
The way you pronounce about makes me believe youre canadian.
Yes
I didn’t think big mouth was that bad. I watched a few episodes in 2020 but it definitely did not captivate my interest enough for me to want to watch more episodes of the show and it definitely did not captivate my interest enough to want to go rewatch it. Netflix definitely has more original TV series that have yet to captivate my interest and that’s probably why I don’t use Netflix that much. and I like Hulu better than Netflix, but I like Netflix to watch on my Block and couple other shows
I don’t understand the hate big mouth is great
I think the reason why Big Mouth is both continued and detested is because it's still exactly what adult animation was intending to be. It's horrific- quite well written, but disgusting, and it pushes the rules of what is acceptable in a way that hasn't been easily achievable since South Park calmed down. The internet hates it, largely because it crosses what they consider crass and the producers love it, largely because it crosses what they consider crass.
The people who comment online are a small amount of users 🤏🏼
yall just don’t get it 😭 obviously it’s not a show for everyone, but watching it in middle school (when i was around the age of the characters in the show) i found myself relating to it & finding a weird comfort within it.   now i’m in high school and currently rewatching it, and it’s just as good as i remember it being. people are so quick to call it off as child porn when, contextually, it’s NOT that. it’s just anatomy. the rare nudity you see of it is non-sexual.   people hate on it without having even watched it. as i said before this show is NOT for everyone lol, but at my personal school-age i find much enjoyment within it. it’s definitely a show for people my age. i can’t imagine a grown adult liking big mouth and i don’t blame them for that because they are simply not who it was made for.
Its funny but its also the most creepy series I ever seen, I mean I never watched any of the creepy yt stuff like don't hug me I am scared but more in a "I would never never never leave my kid alone with Nick Kroll, whats wrong with that dude???" Way, I mean that is the same thing I think about the creator of Don't hug me I am scared but out of completely different reasons. So or so I would still have a traumatized child... also puberty monsters are a VERY accurate potrayal of the male mind on puberty, but maybe thats just me...
I had somebody try and convince me to watch this show but I had seen a few minutes of it here and there but I didn't like it at all but he kept telling me it was good
Very mixed bag in my opinion. Plenty of chuckles. Plenty of groans.
I actually found parts of this show education, it spreads awareness for things that are never given attention. People love to dismiss things that teens go through, and I love how this show shows those things. I personally have learned how to take care of a yeast infection, and I love the body positive episodes, and how it shows everyone feeling shame for things, as most teens feel like they are the only ones who feel that way.
One time I went out to dinner with a girl I met on tinder, and we really hit it off so I was pretty stoked when she invited me back to her place. When we got to her place, she wanted to watch Big Mouth because she loved it and I had never seen it. Halfway through the first episode I was already brainstorming ways to either get her to turn on something else or for me to leave early without hurting her feelings. Despite my best efforts, I had to sit through the first 4 episodes of season 1 before I was able to politely bail on the situation. Needless to say, there wasn’t a second date or a second time I watched Big Mouth.
Yes
To the reviewer : you don’t get it . Great show about the awkward part of life called puberty . Better than most animated shows . Comparing it to Rick and Marty is like “The Godfather “ vs “Good Fellas “
I've always hated the show because Im been told by too many people that I look and act like Andrew from big mouth. Even my name is Andrew. Here I am minding my own business and being compared to a character I know nothing about.   Question: How bad is it that I'm compared to Andrew? Like should I be offended?
25:10 mark part of the dream rotation lol
The show is awful
Yes
I always thought the reason people hate it is because of how gross it is. And yeah, 5 minutes into the video even just hearing a brief description - yeah, its gross. I hate it.
The show returns on the 23rd for a final season. I give the show credit because the characters actually age unlike The Simpsons and Family Guy.
It’s a guilty pleasure for me, I don’t like how gross and woke it could get but I find Maurice and Andrew hilarious
yes, next question.
This show is just kind of nasty.  The art style, the fish lips, kids doing sex stuff, etc...
Where is this guy from i have never heard such a weird accent
I kinda like it tbh
It’s finally season is coming now
46:57 SNK music?
Y’all sensitive asf, you all definitely acted similar to this in middle school - highschool 💀
I love your accent, what is it?
I think you're over thinking it. imagine complaining that south park only has a handful of voice actors (like the kids sounding like adults in big mouth) who do a million voices. or how south park didn't introduce cartmans hate towards Kyle (like big mouth doesnt show pre puberty). it wasn't shown how this originated. they hang out but hate eachother? why don't you hate this? I love both shows btw
i love big mouth idc its so overhated
I think one of the more understandable reasons Big Mouth gets hate is because the vast majority of adults are very uncomfortable with underage characters being sexualized in any form of media, even for story relevance. It's the reason the film Cuties got so much hate.
without even watching the video: the answer is yes
god i feel disgusting just watching this
what adult sits in a writers room and says " should we make this kid jack off again this episode?" "should we show it?"
seriously if a kid was drawn fucking a pillow in an anime style, it would be considered lolicon. all this is is westernized lolicon.
The whole show glorifies pedophilia. Why are adults interested in watching kids go thru puberty? I also dont think that its appropriate for the age group it portrays, leftover group are closeted pedophiles.
Ahhh man the Florida episode is the best
The fact hoops got canceled but this show continues to pump out new seasons faster then like 90% of shows 😭
I feel like big mouth gets better overtime
Big mouth came out when I was in elementary I’m not that old tbh i decided to watch it in middle school I found it to be just a rounchy adult show about sex it didn’t feel real to me i check it out now and I have the same feelings for it as I did back then the show tho taken from experience of the creator probably doesn’t feel real i have brothers multiple I’ve seen boys go thru puberty 3 times over i know what there like there messes but I just can’t like the show in a coming of age story way  The show also feels like it folds into the sex parts a lot tbh like showing a kids naked body but not a adults feels like they were purposely making a joke there about there own show yk
The moment you truly grew up is like an imaginary line drawn in the sand.
I loved the show. I think you're over complicating the show. Its an adult cartoon. Its not made to make sense. Its just a raunchy over the top show that explores the concept of puberty through funny themes. The idea of any adult cartoon is to give it adult themes so it's watchable for adults. and wtf is big mouf!!
I hate this show because it is slop. Like slop for pigs.
i mean people say its bad but it was on the top of netflix so yeah
Yes, the answer is yes
Im not watching the actual video but yes big mouth IS that bad
This trash was real I thought it was a YouTube cartoon or something
missy is half white.. and half black. why do mixed people have to resent their white heritage? talk about reverse racism
am i the only one who likes big mouth 😭
yes
No we don’t like it cause it sexualizes kids lol but maybe that’s hard for you to understand if you got one of THOSE kinda brains
Personally I love big mouth and watch it before going to sleep
It's because you are over complicating it and not watching it while in middle school
It's the worst show ever created
this comment is late but, yes big mouth is that bad
He jerked off to WHAT!
i love big mouth, it had to grow on me tho
sex jokes with 14yos the series
I fucking love big mouth I don't see why people hate on it so much
I liked the first few seasons when it came out I think I was about 14 when it released but after like season 2 it just got way to weird and less funny and now it's just unwatchable.
this show is like doomsrolling but fun, just never question anything and its a good entertainment (but not a good show)
Ew
Big mouuuuuuuth😤😤😤
Did u actually watch the show? u don’t seem to understand it at all like blaming Maury it’s them blaming hormones n when they talk abt him there talking abt hormones
37:26 trans girl here just saying the trans character was just ok it just feels like what cis people think trans people are
36:29
you sound scottish trying to fake an american accent
how dare you say this show is bad i hate youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Big marth
The season 4 Halloween episode was like a bad Persona parody, "I am you, you are me... cringy"
After watching the first two seasons (I couldn’t take anymore) I can laugh at a sexual joke but when that’s 95% of the humor it stops being funny
I used to watch big mouth in high school and the early seasons were good like season 1 , 2 are bad and later seasons are really bad like how they did a crossover with idk the name of the show but they had a spinoff  in it and now the show wants to have these love bugs and it just pushes me away from the show
the series went downhill after S2
Big mouth is fucking wack for casually sexualizing children
The show is weird, Kroll is weird and anyone who is a fan is suspect.
ik im late but i feel like skipping over the arch in season 4 where jessie experiences sexual coercion from her boyfriend. its something MANY teenage girls (and boys) experience growing up and it was one of the most important topics they covered in that season in my opinion.
I don't even have to watch your video to say,  YES, IT REALLY IS THAT BAD
Okay, end all be all feeling about Big Mouth: It's an amazing, creative show that unfortunately doesn't know when to stop being too cringe or gross, that deserves all the praise it gets and mainly gets hate because better shows keep getting cancelled while it continues to get seasons. Human Resources is better btw, but that got cancelled after only two seasons, despite being a step up on the original.
This is the last season of Big mouth😢
Yes, first season was ok but then is a speed run to the bottom.
The only thing I hate in big mouth is the damn musicals, besides it I’ve seen big mouth so many times lol
Whoever edited this video. Don't put the loading screen music for a Japanese racing game that's so loud it's distracting
I love the way he says mouth lol <3
I think you skipped over important parts of certain things like the "throw away" joke about Caleb being able to see them. It wasn't just a throw away it was a joke, but it was more leaning into the "this is the weird kid" thing. Also morri lies constantly so the alien fucking the earth thing couldve actually been a "throw away" as you put it. Point is if you over analyze something, you'll find issues, and you'll end up skipping over the simple parts where you're supposed to give it some suspension of disbelief.
Nick Kroll just creeps me out. I'm sure he's lovely but my body and mind are like, "no. Spooky" so I've never been interested in the show
Dear LsMark I Turned off this video after the intro where you said the answer might shock you and didn’t watch it until now because I thought You were going to say it wasn’t an awful show
fugget about it is better than big mouth
Say wat u want this show is so funny and relatable I love it
I think it would have been cool if they had a character that was on BC throughout their entire puberty. I was in that situation and it just ADDS to the horrors of puberty. Would have loved a nice, chaotic, funny girl dealing with BC
awful video
OH MARK ITS LIKE THE NEW SHOW PIXAR MADE, WIN OR LOSE
Yes and I'm not surprised it's been on Netflix for this long.
lol this is just an adult Fairlyodd parents  with a little bit of  alot of 18+ topics
9:07 this problems reminds me of how stewie griffin can’t apparently be understood by anyone in his family except Brian. But brian can be understood by everyone else. And stewie can be understood by everyone else except his family
Which is funny cause Missy is half Jewish, so the new voice actress by their own standards STILL shouldn't voice her since she not mixed race
Short answer) yes Long answer) yes but because Netflix cancelled actually good shows for this slop
27:21 YAAAYY!!!
2:20 we want nick krill to lose his job
5:03 you forgot to blur the pillow va Jay
Is big mouth really that bad?  Short answer: yes.  Long answer: yeeeeeeessssss
Your accent is like a super saiyan version of a normal canadian accent
The show just sucks lol
yes💔
27:19 actually- Jessi's depression kitty shows up many times throughout the entire show, and isn't considered "completely gone" at any point
23:20 bestie... thats the joke - they're being sarcastic
7:45 oh yeah btw the reason behind that is bc only the kid that the hormone monster/related is currenty being helped is the one who can see them - Maury is Calebs monster (and also its mainly a joke thing 💀)
If ot focused on one kid the hormone monster would have made sense and i feel like they just relied one the three monsters to make it easier to animate
Big mooth 😂😂😂
Whats big marth? Are you Canadian? I think this show is weird because of the drawings and depicted CHILDREN characters
yes, it is. I just saved you eight seasons and a spinoff with another two.
i had a laser pointer next to me, so i used it to distract my depression. Thanks for the tip :3
You have the most annoying autistic voice I’ve ever heard
48:06 so that means he didn’t write this scene either, idk why you’re mad at him for it if all he did was voice the lines he was told too
25:56 to the average viewer this actually reads more as Funny character: Abortions bad! Annoying Redditor: erm actually no! Other annoying character: yeah, she’s right, actually no!  I know because I watched this when I was the target audience (15) with a bunch of my friends.
23:35 I love that actually, idk why that absolutely slaughtered me
For people seeing the hormone monster whenever it’s appropriate for the show, I’d say this is like people being understanding why a 15 yr old is unreasonable SOMETIMES but not always. Same with parents not remembering having their own hormone monster, they don’t have one any more and over time it gets harder to remember what it was like
I didnt mind it it was weird and I started to not like andrew but its not the worst thing on netflix
2:52 Fish
“It looks terrible.” As a criticism only works if you apply it everywhere. Say it about South Park, Rick & Morty, Family Guy, Archer, Bojack Horseman, basically every adult animation. They’re all gross to look at.
well BITCH I’ll have you know this show is pretty funny .
if there's one thing this show does right, it's portray people with autism and adhd correctly
I feel like the show should only be for middle schoolers, because it is clearly about teenagers and puberty.
Yes i hate it 0:00
50:05 😭😭😭
i'm sooo tired of all these shows that have potential to be great, but it's all infected with constant woke programming... i'm sooo god dayum tired of all wokeness... i began watching Big mouth before knowing it was a woke brainwashing, it was funny, except the woke BS just ruined it completely,  can't stand watching the obvious programming...  when will all this woke trash stop infecting everything..?
I got sick and tired of big mouth after the first episode which i found decently  funny, 2nd episode made me feel really bored.  Its like in the first episode they do too much at once with the humor, reminds me of 2nd grade humor
Ls I know this is 2 yrs late 😂 but they made a second show on Netflix also other ppl can’t see others hmonsters
i like big mouth
i found a lot of the beginning and small moments here and there to be really comforting for me. puberty was (and is still) weird because i'm trans, and seeing the reality of what we all go through (and getting information my parents wouldn't teach me about myself lol) was just nice. a lot of this show was bullshit tho lmfao
It wouldn't have had over 6 seasons if it was bad.   Compare this to shows like Inside Job and
Big Möœth
I think this series is severely fucked up, and the people who created it are even more fucked up.
your accent is really confusing me im sorry 😭
the whole hormone monster thing reminds me of stewie where NOONE was suppose to understand him and then they kinda just gave up on that concept lol
Both dead end and inside job was my TOP shows, its sad when they had so much potential.
I started watching it when I was in high school so I liked it cuz I could relate, now it just fields weird to watch having it all be about kids
14:40 i feel like this is bc it’s kinda played out through their perspective and when your young you think you know everything
i watched this show for the first time at 14 years old and i enjoyed it bc i was around the same age and found it relatable but looking back as an adult its a little strange 😭
I liked the first season but watching horny preteens for multiple seasons.. I dunno, it started to walk an uncomfortable line. Plus the art style didn't grow on me. Now, Brickleberry was FORCED on me by netflix and that show was hideous
It’s legit just ch1ld p0rn so it’s automatically icky
That pregnant pillow joke is really good tho
Shows hilarious
Weird question but I’m struggling to place where this guy’s accent is from does anyone know?
I would have rather seen two or three more seasons of Inside Job than I would anymore big mouths
The problems with Big Mouth all make more sense when you realize that it's viewer base is primarily sex offenders.
All the characters are visually displeasing and thats that
the fact that i thought andrew was the main character says a lot
The "I am pansexual" bit made me want to kill myself
@24:44 I JUST noticed the Ridge Racer t4 ost in the bg omg 😭❤️❤️❤️
I always hated how this show looks, and now I have an idea how it is, it reflects that on how ugly and weird it looks
Still mad about the dark crystal being canceled right after winning awards.
I hate the stupid idea that white people can't voice other races. Most people who say that shit probably wouldn't care if a black person was voicing a white person (or Asian in Samurai Jacks case). They are voice actors they just need to fit the character not be the same race.
The only reason Caleb and Matthew were able to see at andrews hormone monster is because Maury also works with them.
I totally hate this show on Netflix
big marth
in one episode they actually showed how the only person that can actually see the monster is the kid, and its like the kids talking to no one, but they have this ongoing joke with like.. i guess mentally disabled characters being able to see them, since theyr the only ones that have directly adressed them (Caleb, whos autistic, and Coach Steve, who idk has all kinda things tbh), which is WILD somehow. or i guess old characters(like the old Rabbi or idk what that old jewish man was) or just random celebrities and stuff who directly talk to Maury, but Maury constantly does that anyways oh. and ghosts i guess, but I can forgive that one i SUPPOSE.  but anyways thats still dumb bc considering all the sh!t andrew and the others say to their monsters, that would make ZERO sense, and yet sometimes other people CAN see the monsters and talk to them (ex. whenever nick saw him and talked directly to him) so the rules are SO confusing cuz ?? 90% only the kid can see them but sometimes like otehr ppl can see them as well but its not explained why or how at all and ik its a dumb ahh cartoon but STILL damn  and in that same episode where they show the thing i mentioned at first, Andrew (or an older version of Andrew, I guess.) seems to REMEMBER Maury! So im like. wait so adults (or i guess ppl whove lost their v*rg*nity, since APPARENTLY thats the only reason they leave, according to multiple episodes from both Big Mouth and Human Resources, which like, what if you're ace or just never have es ee ex? do you see the damn monster your whole life?) DO remember them or not? cuz like if they did it would change everything as well cuz why do they never talk about them or anything idk     ANYWAYS, the one thing that this show should absolutely get rid of (ofc it should change in many ways, but i mean TRULY get rid of) is every single gross thing Jay has done to his inanimate objects... or maybe keep ONLY the pillow but dont make it weird and gross like they made it??? why did they make the pillow sentient and HAVE A BABY? and why did they make it so his brothers "used" HIS PILLOW as well and like made it as if she cheated on him or wtv and the baby was his brother's like thats absolutely DISGUSTING
“What would consider your favorite season of that show? 99% of the time I have to assume it’s something past the first few seasons” Proceeds to show the two most famous examples of a shows that peaked in their first few seasons
Stay away from Factor ground meat.
Big Mouth has the opposite problem of Family Guy. When it goes flat out raunchy and no holds bars it doesn't work, but when it tries to be dramatic it actually does a good job at addressing real issues.
The hormone monster is invisible to everyone who they aren’t talking too
Can you cover moral prep one day? Its A really cool adult swim show about religious trauma and parental issues.
"Pansexual"? This b*tch f*cks pans...? Gross. Keep that girl away from our kitchenware
Painfully unfunny. Super ugly art style. One of the worst shows I’ve ever watched by far
Bigmouth is just CP with extra steps 😂
My issue is this show got all these seasons but I’m still waiting for season 2 of kingdom and all of us are dead
it’s not bad at all it’s like my fav show i quote it all the time
Fun fact: people who hate this show love south park like it’s any different
I just don't like that it sexualized middle schoolers lol
Dude it's just a s3xually r3tarded cartoon show. Made up by a kinda funny comedian and I don't think they were trying to compete with stand by me or the breakfast club or perks of being a wallflower or whatever. I mean Wile E Coyote gets mangled and or dies in every cartoon. It's not that deep. I think Mystery Science theater said it best when they sang " if your wondering how he eats and breaths or other science facts just repeat to yourself it's just a show you should really just relax" besides that this show just isn't for you that's obvious lol
Honestly don't think about things too much when watching this lol
Yes it’s that bad
Big  mouth is bad. Its not about the animation, which is poor and sloppy, its the weak writing. It like a boomer is trying to guess was a 12yo would find edgy. The voice acting is poor and easily pulls people out of the few moments it manages to set up. The prose is bad, It feels like its mostly AI written. The characters, through season two, are entirely one dimensional and never learn anything. The story did not go anywhere. The children never grow up despite that being the point of the show.
Literal child porn
Every character has gigantic lips and a weird mouth because Nick Kroll has gigantic lips and a weird mouth and he thinks that's just how people are.
I hate to admit it but my favorite characters are Andrew's dad and Coach Steve yes I do have some screws loose in my head
Yes it is. Its not funny, the art style is ugly, and the themes are gross. Couldnt get through one episode. Iirc virtually everyone hated this.
It made me remember middle school fondly instead of hating it. I thought it was ok
the first couple of episodes made me laugh, but then as you watch further you realize this show is just a pedophiles dream.
Am i the only one who actually love this show? 🥲🥲🥲
Would you stop whining?
i dont think big marth js that bad
This dude talks like hes got a mouth full of semen. Like seriously pronounce the words right. If you have to look up how to pronounce something this isnt the video for you like some on my little sister talks more clearly than you do. Sounds like a hippy tryna be a surfer dude
Bro keeps saying “Bug Maurth”
Well yeah but like, it's children showing their genitals. Any argument you have about the show is immediately out the window with that. It's a bad show
as someone who can recite basically the entire show, coach steve and suzette are the best parts :/
See this is why I watched Human Resources!!!! That show was so much better, the characters had depth and there was actual plot to the narrative while being hilarious! Plus in that show they're all adults so it's much less creepy 😅
I don’t like big mouth as a minor because it makes me WILDLY uncomfortable. Honestly I don’t like how it’s portrayed on middle school kids because I feel like that’s way too young to focus on and not to mention the lewd parts of kids legit being butt ass naked just doesn’t sit right with me.
I though the show was pretty entertaining and funny, it is cringe and weird at times but overall a fun watch.  On the other hand it is very infuriating that it keeps going on while other great animated shows are getting cancelled. It doesn’t deserve that many seasons
Animation reminds me of DuckMan 😊
Idgaf i miss Cartoon Network
We're all different and to be honest I enjoyed the show there has been over exaggerated parts of the show but it ain't as bad you think it is not gonna lie it grows on you the show the sing a longs were not needed but animations lately are all about sing a longs... yet again I have no hate for this shows  crude way is what makes the name big mouth?
I didn't watch this vid yet but im guessing the answer is yes
Wait is the music at 3:49 a Tekken 5 track or something
netflix killed inside job to keep people watching big mouth 🤫
48:30 you know a show is bad when an example of how to do a joke better is f*cking uncle grandpa
Honestly I love big mouth, it’s very accurate to the middle school/puberty experience in my opinion. Sucks that they cancelled Inside Job and other shows though.
Yeah
Oh obviously Morey is a hallucination, who Andrew sees, when others see it, it's thru Andrew's view. And it's becoming a group psychosis, like those twins IRL who were running into traffic (really sad, i think one survived?)
ok, but independent of Big Mouth being good or bad, they're one of the only ones that made a song that nails the Queen style and idk how to feel about it XD
To save your time yes
Big mouth had the ric and north affect shit died after season 4
I thought I was tripping when I heard back 2 back from sonic rush, paused the video thinking I left Spotify open. I then realized Mark has top notch taste in music
its very bad and i cant believe i watched 2 seasons.
"why are you criticizing this show? people worked hard on it." Is such a braindead argument idek why you choose to engage with it.
After the first season yea
The problem with this video is that big mouth is one of them shows that ur clearly not meant to take seriously because the show doesnt even take itself seriously. Its a show that runs off shock value and adult humour, its one of them shows where they dont want you to look into it too hard but to just turn your brain off for 20 minutes and just watch shit happen. My point is that big mouth isnt a show that deserves a conversation or a critique, it simply is. Im partly biased because im a fan of the show myself. (Late asf comment but still felt like saying something)
have to say, after six seasons, I still love the show
AYE WHO ELSE 😤💨😶‍🌫️ WHILE WATCHING THIS 🗣🔥🔥🥬
I feel like you don't understand Bigmouth in the slightest. The reason there are so many hormone monsters is because some people have different experiences with puberty, and the reason some of them have the same one is because they are going through generally the same thing. All the actors arent trying to sound like kids or not. All of them except Missy are just using their real voices. The reason they dont have a dramatic change at the end of the episode is because in real life you wouldnt either. Its a comedy. Things are going to be realistic and  over exaggerated. The reason people cant see the hormone monster/monsteress', is because its a metaphor for their hormones and emotions. Its really simple. Dont over think it. As a teenager it actually is relevant to me. Theres plenty of things in the show that dont make sense and dont have any reality behind them, because its a comedy. But there's also so much of the show that makes it realistic. Life dosent make sense sometimes. Especially when youre going through puberty. the whole show makes sense from the standpoint of someone who just wants to watch. Thats why so many people hate it. Because they go through the first 2/3 episodes and dont understand it.
1:44 Ever since they had Black Panther listed as the number one top rated movie I don't take rotten tomatoes seriously, don't get me wrong it wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't even close to be the best.  As Big Mouth is concerned, it was nice show for a little while, I enjoyed first 2 or 3 seasons because they were relatable and funny, now it absolutely sucks. I still watch because I'm invested in it enough, but I hate every minute of it, it's just a woke garbage at this point.
Big mouth is my guilty pleasure show, just reminds me of watching the first season back in like 6th grade
Having a self insert as a child character gives huge red flags
Bro, just don't watch the show.
okay dead end just sucked and no one can change my mind
Why is he saying big marth
The potential of this show could have been great about covering topics about sexual, anxiety, confidence, social pressure, and growing up. It was pretty disappointing. if they did it right, meta humor isn't needed, relatablitity could have covered that humor
7:45 there’s a very simple explanation to this. Caleb is all seeing God who cannot be destroyed, and he can see everything. The other people are way too stupid to see it.
Idk who’s authoring this but you are slow ash😂. Clearly it’s a figment of there imagination where no one else can see or hear when they’re speaking to them.. thought it would’ve been basic common sense. There’s nothing wrong with the show ur just bored LOL
big mouth is repulsive jewish propaganda that kids shouldn't be watching. and if you are about to respond with "it's not a kid's show" then who is it for? Pedophiles? because every episode seems to revolve around children talking about sexual experiences... why the fuck are you watching that?
Also- BRING BACK Inside Job and Dogs In Space!! Eyebrows, eyebrows 😳
The Monsters are them. It says that during the show. I hated it at first. I felt the kids and the sex was unnecessarily being blended. Then I actually watched it and there’s something oddly comforting about it. There are some relatable moments and it still manages to be hilarious. Andrew Glouberman, Lola Skumpy, Shane Lizard, and the hormone monster Rick are iconic characters. Also, coach Steve doing sex on a lady is pure gold! Touch your sweetie. Because it’s all about the p*ssy and the p*ssy don’t lie! Soft Daddy says, Big Mouth is THE. BEST. That is all.
12:17 it’s not supposed to feel natural, cus sometimes puberty doesn’t feel natural sometimes you feel sweaty and gross or sometimes you put yourself in poor situations that change your prospective, that was my take on it
Um…Mark the show will end next year lol 55:32
The Tekken background music is killing me🤣
I hate everything produced by Netflix
I am probably one of the biggest fans of this shows. I rewatched it more than 20 times I'm sure (and I NEVER rewatch shows and movies). It's such a comfort show when you get into it, it's funny af, relatable and character centered so you can enjoy it without being to focused on the plot. If you enjoy the humor and the character you'll enjoy the show. It's the realest show about puberty I have ever watched, it's so disgusting and sometimes vomit inducing (like puberty is in reality). I'm sure it has manyy flaws, and I'm sure I have a bias because I watched it so much, but truelly no show has all the elements of Big mouth. I always ask people who don't like this show to recommend me something with similar elements and themes but good in their opinion and they have nothing to say.
I just think it’s creepy like kind of pedoughish
Bro I can’t stand the way he says big mouth 😂😭😭
This show is how I learned about puberty
Big mouth has some nice looking characters that get good screen time so that's the main reason I can watch it besides the fact I got sucked into the lore very deep! Missy is adorable and depression kitty would be a very cute plush!
yes, it is
Big Mouth is one of the best animated shoes Netflix has put out. You can't change my mind.
Its funny most of the jokes land...its just that it shows naked children......
As someone who watched this whole series - yes - it’s absolute trash, it is so gross and the jokes aren’t funny
Why do you say “big marth” instead of “mig mouth”?
23:26 that IS in fact the joke
The big mouths are supposed to be like nick krolls infamously big lips, So that mever really bothered me
Its funny sometimes but you will have to skip alot of the stuff It reminds me of fearfactor
People watch it tho it always manages to make it into the top 10 when the new season premieres
I liked it it was “relatable”
I am not really into the crudeness of big mouth but I do like some topics they handle, especially a recent episode including an autism plot which was beautiful. I did like human resources more. I think they can only see their own monsters, but Caleb can see it because he's autistic, I think. In human resources adults have monsters too
This dude is raging that it’s not realistic, it’s not supposed to be. Dude chill
I can see what they’re trying to do, but I just don’t think you should sexualize children
23:22 THATS LITERALLY THE JOKE DAWG 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
I watched the first 6 seasons when I was 14, it was because it’s genuine brain rot and I could just watch it and be entertained without comprehending any of it. I only remember like 3 things that happened in that show
Yes
I wanna bleach my eyes after seeing that thumbnail
I thought the show had a unique concept. I never truly understood the controversy surrounding it, as it’s meant to be uncomfortable on purpose. Sometimes the content got stale (like the recent international episode) but for the most part I enjoyed it, and have even rewatched it in the last month.
Me personally i love big mouth i dont understand why people hate it its a really good show like i dont know why people take this shit personally
Why can’t this guy say the word “mouth” properly?
did you even watch it? you said nick and jessie smoked. twice. bruh, they ate a gummy. if you wanna analyze it, it helps to open your eyes
i'm removing the thumb i stuck up you
explaining jokes is like the funniest thing ever. you obvi don't get antihumor
rather watch big mouth than family guy any day. family guy is lazy af!
"your writing lacks subtlety. you can't just have your characters announce how they feel. that makes me feel angry"- robot devil
sure a kid would start yelling their mom's the patriarchy
you referenced the same r&m scene in the f is for family vid i watched yesterday
thank you, i've been saying big mouth and fairly odd parents share a universe, just like bojack horseman and adam lion
I like big mouth, great representation. sometimes it's even borderline educational
Big mouth became WAAAAAAY too preachy and crass. Once they started pushing the, "call your unborn baby 'they'", i checked out.
Inside Job was cancelled for some edgy ass puberty show
After finding out they cancelled a different show just to make room for a big mouth spin off, I am actually real pissed about that.
Better than family guy at least
At first i liked the show, it wasn't great but i enjoyes it, but when shows i actually cared for got cancelled i was like "why big mouth got another season?" When Inside Job and Last Kids on Earth got cancelled and the annoucement of new Big Mouth seasons really made hate the show
The creator is a nepo baby. I know his dad must have ways to have this show continue
I am not going to spend the next hour listening to somebody complain about a show called Big MEYETH.
it's funny that people say Big Mouth artsts and animators are untalented to produce an ugly show. But it takes the exact same ammount of skill, if not more, to design and animate an ugly look that is cohesive and moves fluidly as it would to do an aesthetic look (which is often more minimalist)
Bc it’s a good show
This show is about children and sexuality.If you don't understand what makes that wrong, you should be on a list.
It's the wokest piece of garbage  propaganda on tv
i like the show...
Gaeehh
I like the concept of the hormone monsters like and what they represent but the art style is hideous and if its a show about puberty why do we never see them actually age? And most scenes are super uncomfortable i genuinely dont mind the show but its not something i would chose…
I cant lie... i love the show
Considering that Netflix let "Cuties" air and didn't remove it until enough people complained, I'm not suprised that a show about adolescent kids reaching sexual maturity is given a pass.
Big Marth
Ultimately I believe Big Mouths biggest hurdle is that, surface level wise??? Its a show about children being horny and haveing their genitals shown on screen... multiple times And I feel like it's fair that most people see that and refuse to dig any deeper, instead just writing it off entirely... Myself included Like, No Thanks I'm Good Actually
I just like to think they kept all of the young characters' voices deeper because of creeps or something and so its easier on the audience trying to make them forget these are kids.
Big mouth is fire
Netflix Adult Cartoon
It had. Good start aaaaand kind feel off, when then made it a bit creepy. But yeah I agree potential was there they were talking psychological professionals and somewhere it just slipped
I think its pretty telling that the biggest Big Mouth fan I knew was the woman thag sexually assaulted me
Whenever i see this show, i always think of the Smiths "bigmouth strikes again" lol 😭😭
0:54 i fucking love this line
So how you are describing Big Mouth as is like having all the Lego pieces for a huge set without the instruction book
I don’t think it’s a horrible show, I mean yeah for sure the animation is really weird looking and I’m not the biggest fan of it, but the content is ok. I watched the first three seasons back in 2019 because I was dating a guy who really liked the show and recommended it to me (he was a prick, should have been a red flag).  I never thought it would’ve deserved 4 more seasons and an Emmy. I don’t think I will watch the other seasons, there are much better shows and so little time in a day, so yeah not worth it
hi unrelated but does anyone know where this guy is from his accent is really cool
23:35 S L E N D E R M A N
Yes, it is
Why are you acting like you're some kind of lynchpin in the knowledge of coping with depression?
big marth
Idk j liked the show, i mean i do not like the fact that they cancelled inside job because wth but other then that i mean the show for me is actually pretty good
55:09 Hawyever???
So we got CP instead of season 3 of inside job. And you're wondering why people are mad? Bro, that's sus.
The biggest problem with it can be explained by the laser pointer scene. In writing, a metaphor is a metaphor whether you've personified it or not, for the story to be cohesive and have a lesson that makes sense (since the set up for a lesson is already there) you must defeat it using something that relates to the actual problem the metaphor is meant to represent.  The issue is that they personified a metaphor in her mind and solved it in a way that would only work outside of her mind and would only work physically which is not really in line with how depression actually is whatsoever, it entirely ruins the stakes, not only for that episode, but for if they choose to ever do something similar to a different character
The concept of big mouth is just weird, the idea and what it shows about it is creepy. There are literally less pen*s jokes in South Park and most the time in South Park those jokes are told about adults half the time whereas big mouth it's children every time. Its just plain creepy, and the story is incoherent. Its family guy meets cuties.
37:16 bababooe
Ugly animation, bad voice acting, fanbase meatriding, pedophilic appeal...  Yeah I see why "everyone" loves this garbage
Horomone monstress is so bad though
caleb, andrew, and mathew has the same monster
big marth
Big Marth
I think the show has fallen off in later seasons, but for someone who grew up in a very conservative household where I never even got the birds and the bees talk, the show felt _incredibly_ validating. I'm in my 30s now and watching it takes me right back to the confusion of puberty and trying to figure shit out on my own.  Is it crass humor? Absolutely. But by making these thing the source of jokes, it breaks them down to where you can have more serious talks about them.
They don't all see Maury, Nick can sometimes but not all the time, and no human can usually see everyone’s hormone monsters or anything so that's why they're not everywhere, idk ahhh and jay doesn't have one cuz he's j that horny on his own and they each have their own personal problems the more the show goes on and do mature in ways
This isn’t even a take on the show but I’m sorry the way the commentator says words mouth or how it’s like “NAURRR CLEO “ from H20
It’s a fun watch when I was in high school but after I turned 18 it felt gross watching this. I’m not calling the adults who enjoyed it PDFiles but it’s just not for me at this point in my life.
The episode when they are high is dumb. I think it’s supposed to be Nick and Jesse greening out which can cause you to hallucinate and make your vision wobbly.
I think the reason why people hate big mouth is because its 90 percent ch** p*** that's my problem with it
Yes.
Yes.
Wtf is big mouth
they could have smoked laced weed something like that happened to me
As a pre teen this show actually helped me feel less weird and left out knowing other kids most likey felt the exact same and were going through the exact same bodily changes. Yeah theres alot of inappropriate things in it but they ARE things teenagers go through through life doing and seeing. They talk about periods/puberty, horniness from being a hormonal teen dating lifes the feeling of shame ect. It talks about EVERYTHING every single other show is to "embarrassed or feel they will be cancelled" over saying or doing what they do. This show really is before its time and i was SHOOK that people didnt freak tf out as soon as the first episode was seen. Teenagers have so many questions we never get answered soon enough and this show talks about every single topic you would need to know about. Sex, stds, personal relationships, masterbation, how to have safe sex and not get pregnant and just how to grow up without being so confused about what your going through as a hormonal teenager
i think the abortion episode only really works in america, where abortion is still considered a taboo in a lot of places and there’s greater pushes to teach abstinence rather than contraception in schools
Y'all just hating on Big Mouth
I don’t think big mouth is inherently bad. I think ppl just tend to hate on it a lot more bc it undeservingly gets more seasons than other shows on Netflix. But tbh at the end of the day it’s a cartoon and so ofc it’s not always gonna be relatable or realistic. But I think that’s ok bc the entire point of cartoons is entertainment 😂 . I mean hey all I’m sayin is if u don’t like it that much then don’t even watch it. Bc hate watching even just 1 episode of smth gives Netflix the data and therefore the idea that it’s liked. 🤷🏽
I’m sorry but where are you from? Why do you say mouth like that? I don’t want to be mean but I was losing my mind trying to figure out what accent this is
I hate Big mouth, I can't believe great shows like boondocks, squidbillies and aqua teen hunger force get cancelled but crap like Big mouth stays on the air. TV executives just suck
All of the problems with the rules of the show seem to have the defence of “that’s the joke bro” . Like it’s cheap way to get out of good writing
😂😂😂Who ever this narrator is explaining all this IS FREAKING FUNNY AS HELL 👍🤣🤣🤣
For me I watched some of it over the years I can’t tell you if it’s good or bad, but it just makes me uncomfortable to as in seeing kids in these sexual situations and the level of crass and vulgarity is just too much and too weird for me.
I’m surprised you didn’t mention just how *wrong* Lola was in Season 2. Both she and Andrew were wrong, Lola more so, but the show treats Andrew as the perpetrator and Lola as completely correct in both breaking his wrist and assembling a hate mob against him.  I can’t believe I stuck around for 3 seasons.
(it's not)
I love big mouth! Wish this show came out when I was younger 😂 jay is my favorite character
Yeah it is, the end.
unpopular opinion… BIG MOUTH YOU COULD NEVER MAKE ME HATE YOU 😭😭😭😭
This opinion is unpopular but I really liked big mouth. I went through a lot changes that I could relate to in big mouth! It made me happy to watch as I could relate so much
They look in bread
Why do you say mouth like that
😊😊😊😊
why does he say big mouth like that
Yeah this show ass
Answer: Yes
I just don't understand the method to the madness? Why does this.... show not get canceled but other shows that have equal or better ratings do? I dont have an opinion on the show itself i don't remember anything about the show
I enjoy it and human resources 😂 Judd is everything lol
Why bro is talking like that!
Big Mouth: ❌ Big Mawr: ✔
"Is BigMouth really that bad?" Answer: Yes. Yes it's really that bad.
If you watch the spin off Human Resources you can see how the hormon monster world is
This one stayed alive so long because it has Netflix' two favorite things. A series that targets children, and it's very s**ual in nature.
Tbh i can see how people dont like the show..its lewd and very out there but i LOVEEEEEE it. Its so god damn funny and i really dont see how u can hate it. I mean yes u can dislike it but…hate?…idkkkk…
I just wanna say hearing the Streets of Rage 2 music playing during this was a holy shit moment for me. I love the series, other than that, I can't really disagree with anything you said. It's just all true, S1 basically almost entirely put me off from the show, and barely kept me around for S2, to which it got BETTER but not amazing obviously. I haven't seen S5 or 6 but been wanting to see if it's worth it, so I'll have to check it out
It keeps getting new season because it’s a cheap money grab because sex sells.  I enjoy adult animation, but I don’t like this one.  It’s overly focused on sex and making cheap sex jokes.  Got old by episode two.  I ditched the series.
shut the fuck up its pronounced big mouth not beg marf
I hate. This because people will look at anyone who watches anime.And call them pedophiles where there's this one that actually shows naked kids
One of the things the animators keep forgetting is that their characters are under 18. But since when has Hollywood ever cared about age?
I like big mouth, I don’t mind that it doesn’t make sense, I don’t mind that the characters don’tprogress much (except there were some big changes last season), or that they don’t talk like children. It’s honestly not a show that I try to apply logic to, like Family Guy sorta I kind of just turn it on and let it play out and maybe giggle at the nonsense. That being said, I definitely think it’s really stupid that it has continued this long while much better shows have gotten canceled.
For me it's a good series that honestly if you watch it you see why it has this much seasons. I think it's hated on because it's very sexual including young people but it's a solid show which I think deserves it's seasons if you watch it. Episodes aren't the longest and there's like 10 episodes so it makes sense... Not the greatest show but a good watch though.
big marth
i loved it, and still love it,  i find it very relatable, but yeah i mean it takes every topic to the extreme limit, which makes it kind of unreal; however i think most people can really relate to every concept on the show, the hormon-due changes both phisical and mental; the dysfunctinal families and the way they impact a kid's life. I also loved the humor but thats very subjective. My point is that in this show there's a very accurate descprition of puberty and just how hard it can get. And apart from that there is a whole lot of relatable situations often traumatic, (for example jesse's reaction to her parents' separation and the awkwardness in meeting their new "significant other")
big mourth
i fucking love F is for family and superbad
honestly I think the main reason I liked Big Mouth so much when it first came out was because in 2017 I was literally in 7th grade. The same age as the cast in the first season. So it was kind of funny as I was literally going through Puberty for the first few years of this show. I haven't watched it in years but im honestly surprised it's still going to this day, it's one of those shows that stays relevant and gets enough views but nobody I know watches it anymore and my friends and I only ever talk about it when talking about middle school days, so
The hormone monster being a separate entity makes all that shit so dubious and predatory, what do you lean you gave that child a boner
ion even like big mouth, but this critisism it nitpicky asf
all my homies hate big “maarrth”
My god. You would be a bigmouth simp …
7:30 no, the giant Alien isn't canon. In one of the season finale's they are very clear that the hormone monsters/creatures are all just metaphors. The hormone monster is just an visualization of their feelings.   I'm not here to defend the show but you're information here is flat out wrong.
@4:16 or maybe The League?
Nick Kroll is one of the least-funny/overrated comedians in the industry. “Haha puberty humor” is basically his comedy manifesto .
Whatever you think about the show. Bigmouth is the most Jewish show on T.V. Take that however you will.
Eh. Not gonna lie i think it really represents what middle school/early highschool actually feels like. Its definitely really gross, but thats what puberty feels like. Also i could see the episode where nicks sister choses what birth control to go with beinf shown in a high school health class ngl.
Its for pedos
Its for pedo
I dont like bigmouth because it sexualizes teenages, and the creator is likely a creep too
I got an idea.....get nick kroll
My d!ck hurt watching this
Its wayy too close to cheese pizza
Where from Canada is this guy from
Wow, I have never had any of the issues you have. You say "you know this is you watch the show" a few times, and I haven't ever felt so irritated about it. I take it for the silly show with no real rules that it is and that's about it. Them breaking rules they didn't really have in the first place has never taken me out of the show.
yes, i saved you a whole hour
well its borderline CP and I don't help but feel dirty seeing clips from it so.... ew....
I'd say it's 50/50. Hakf the jokes are just terrible or cringe. But then you have a brilliant one out if nowhere.  "Yeah sis that's how we make the cause progress ! By shaming pregnant woman until they cry !!!"
Too the issue of the character design:   They had to be designed to look like deformed catfish people or the people making the show would get sent to prison for making cp.
Bro going out of his way to keep from saying he actually likes the show and that alone is enough reason to ignore the subscribe button
yes
I've never seen the show but I'll watch it now.
Also also. I think the reason nick could be repersinting the rare ocurance of males actually activating the wrong hormone gland for puberty will activate the female one.  Or u know it could also be like how some guys act like big cry babies sometimes in puberty.
Naw they really made Mary j ( weed) look like I just took a hit of dmt or a tab of avid bruh. From a pot smoker him self I can comfirm it shouldn't do that, only way it can do that is if someone laces it.
I had fun watching Season 1 back when it aired and liked Season 2 and watched all the other seasons. Still, it wasn't until I saw this video that it clicked that none of the episodes actually stuck with me and was processed more as "background noise" and I realized that I don't think I like it, but it was still getting watched because it was there. Kind of like what I did with Disenchantment.
I loved that point. there's like 3 episodes where characters get high; and usually your vision will just be slightly blurry and spinny/shaky and you wont feel hungry, but will have the urge to binge eat, and everything tasted 50x better. got high at a bbq and a single piece of burger meat, alone, was the BEST THING EVER
I have not watched the Video yet and i can tell you that yes... It is actually that bad
Yes it is
Yes. Yes it IS that bad.
im not the biggest fan of big mouth but its so ridicoulous that you go on about how you like to comsume media critically and you guess big mouth fans don't do that in order to enjoy this show, but then gloss over many of the shows more important moments or well written sequences by saying "nothing is explained". The themes and messages would be explained if you consumed media critically or do you want them to spoon feed everything to you, despite complaining about the times the show does that too?   This is specifically about the halloween and nick star sequence. i thought it was pretty clear that the trip nick went on wasnt time travel or the actual future nick, but a direct critique of his narcissistic and self serving traits that nick manifested as an adult tv personality. the end of the show where the older nick takes over came across to me like a sign that after a traumatic experience in the haunted house, nick's takeaway was that he cant trust anybody to be there and he has to only look out for no 1, eg, his narcissistic and asshole. traits are amped up and he gives himself over to them
The issue is the keep canceling good shows after 1 or 2 season to just keep making big mouth and yes big mouth is that bad, not only should the people that are responsible for it be fired but they should be in prison for crimes against humanity
Yes.
The only character I liked by the end was Matthew, and his friendship with Caleb was sweet :) (I like the episode focused on Caleb in season 6 coz Same)
I love big mouth lol some scenes I be like okay y’all doing to much but other than that it’s funny as hell and from a girls pov very accurate😂😂😂
yes it is
This is some Drake shit
I don't mind. I like big mouth still but I'm a teenager so I can kind of relate a bit
This man truly suffered for this thank you
The weird jumping between a Scottish accent and an American accent on any given word is tickling my angry nerve I’ll be honest  How are you going to say “mouth” like a regular person, fully pronouncing the word as it was meant to be pronounced, then say it like a native Scott two sentences later?
This show is so creepy...it literally shows a child talking to her own vagina....just because its animated doesn't mean that is okay.
Ohhh my god this whiny ass man with the world worst accent I literally can’t. Bigmouth was good. This wasn’t
This video shows that you rlly need to watch a show instead of listening to a person on youtube. This video kind of sucked but for the most part you'd only know this by watching the show
What is this man’s accent. It’s so weird
people hate big mouth cause it's just cp and fetish bullshit
If people would look like this in my lived reality I'd rather fück pillows as well.
I really feel only people who are teens can truly understaand the show i watched and albeit gross at times That's what puberty is? Who remembers puberty being not a little grotesque i could use ejaculation moments but for instance the time when missy goes to a bath house with her mom and jesse. That was the first time i learned about women bodys and breast not being like barbie dolls depict. An adult may see this as inappropriate but are theee not moments in puberty we all feel ashamed of at times. Their could be less nudity but other then that i enjoyed the show. The pillow thing shows teen pregnancy withoht sacrificing one of the characters, hormone monsters are more of an experience less of a physical thing. And the more monsters like depression kitty or logic rock are nice because it shows so many different aspects of teen life
I really like your video but every time I hear you say the word mouth, my teeth grind a little  * update:   I’ve subscribed
i just dont watch big mouth cause it gives them views. netflix keeps the shows that get watched, and gross humour is popular with kids, who are half of their audience.
you’re looking way too hard into a show where a literal blue alien banged the earth, it will never be that deep bro
When I had netflix the great shows i'd find would ALWAYS, WITHOUT AN EXCEPTION get cancelled after the first season
Okay, so... is it ever actually important that there's a male character with a female hormone monster, and is anything actually done with that? Because out of everything described here, that was the one thing that actually made me curious what they were getting at without ever really seeming to 'pay off' in the review.
yes, yes it is
I’m still trying to wrap my head around the fact that ppl don’t like this cartoon because it’s not realistic. Uhm wtf it’s a cartoon meant for entertainment for adults only. It doesn’t have to make sense lol
This show is for people who like little kid's 😂 fr look at it, why sexual the kids lol
Thank you! This video cured my depression. I went out and bought a laser pointer, and BAM! I’m happy!
Holy shit. The guy who fucks his pillows is the same voice as rexplode from invincible
this is exactly how my middle school experience went your just not part of american culture lil bro
I actually quite like big mouth. It’s a really good visual into the puberty process. It started coming out basically as soon as I finished puberty and I found myself relating to Jessie and missy a lot. The not knowing and exploration in their bodies was so funnily relatable. It’s realistic but also sooo stupid and vulgar which is why as a 14 year old I liked it a lot. I don’t think it needed that many seasons tho. Other shows could have gotten the budget and “screen time” that Big Mouth got and I think that’s the biggest issue I have with the show.
its an alright show, i find it funny.
I've returned to say something Mr. LS... The movie Juno is probably my favorite coming-of-age thing. Way better than Big Mouth
the ending didn’t age well lol. the 8th season is going to be the last
This show is basically family guy and sex education mushed together
As someone who grew up watching this show during my middle school years, yeah it kinda sucks but it was kinda my comfort show, it was nice to just watch a semi funny show about kids going threw all the same shit and not everything just resetting by the end
big marnth
I can't process how much I hate the way you say mouth
I think its a good show top ten if mine im 14 and this show relates to me so much i love it
Answer- Yes.
Is it as bad as people make it out to be sometimes? No, but is it good enough to go on for as long as it has and make multiple spin offs? Also no.
I did get really pissed when inside job got canceled when they left me off a cliffhanger! But big mouth is so amazing and funny, it’s really good
well I’ve seen worse
Small mouth
Big marth
This shit is the most Jewish thing ever. A show designed to look like it’s for children but it’s about degenerate shit. “Everyone went thru this kind of stuff” nah fam, we didn’t fuck pillows
Yes
Big merth wtf accent is this
The way you say "gay" and "face" is so funny, where are you from my guy? 😭
It's a real sheem.
“Hey what’s up Caleb” that or the line “I’d kill a man a hard working family man” my absolute favorite lines in the whole show I quote them so often
Big mouth mark will haunt my dreams
25:32 -For some people it does. Your personal experience is not everyone's. Also, you chill out because it intoxicated you. It affects the same part of your brain alchohol does (as well as a lobotomy) in simialr fashion. It lowers its functionality so your inhibitions, reasoning and emotional response are neutered. It pushes you temperarily up on the spectrum of sociopathy and that's why it's easier to just deal. Because your being an apathetic ass to everyone around you who isn't affected similarly. It can be a great tool for people with high anxiety and medical issues but like any drug should be used responsibly. You push away yhe shame wizard when you puff it up but it doesn't mean the consequences go away. When you male slime corperate decisions on your youtube buisness with Mr. Greensmoke  making it easier, doesn't mean yoy won't be doxed and held accout Abel socially till you die if destitution and a lit blunt shoved up your anus.
21:33 - The humor takes you out of it less? The writting gets better? This is the season when they double down on the strait up rip-off cutaway jokes. Like just suddenly hacing the three main characrers int he Seinfeld coffee shop acting like Jerry, Elian and Gearge with no explaination because.. remember SEINFELD was a thing?! It and 90s sitcoms are currently popular with hipsters for the nostalgia so if we make you think of it randomly we are comedic geniuses and our show great righhhhht!? I did not like season 1 much but knew it sometimes takes a couple seasons to get your feet and build up better. I watched season 2 when it came out and immediatly gave up on this show entirely. I don't know what crack you were smoking but season two was season one but going in harder and lazier. They left behind what little positive they had on the writing when it came to creativity, originality and dignity. It really felt like they knew Netflix was gunning for animation and pulled out every cheap trick they could in desperation not to be one of the canceled..its a sad and shameful excuse of "work."  23:29 - Just futher evidence they were sucking up and pulling out all the stops for Netflix over being an actual good show for the audience.
I really wanted to like Nick Kroll after watching The League, his character Ruxtin is hilarious.... Then Kroll Show came out.... Then Big Mouth.... And he does countless guest appearances on other people's things invariably as a Kroll Show character. He's just not a funny guy at all, except as the straight man from The League, and he's goddamn hilarious there.... Annoying af everywhere else
I wonder which kind of hormone monster trans kids get lol
I thinkt he biggest issue with Big Mouth is that it's a show about prepubescent teens talking about sex and shown in sexual situations.   It's also made by and entirely voiced by a crew of adults, so it strikes me as creepy.
I never really thought the characters having no clear motives through the show as unrealistic. In real life, our wants and “motives” change constantly ESPECIALLY when growing up. Going through the motions is apart if that, realizing you don’t know what you want yet and just doing what you have to until you figure it out
out of the loop for a bit. But they canceled Inside Job?! What kind of horseshit is that?! One of the most entertaining Netflix originals in a long time; what are they smoking?
7:18 "HOEUUWE"
Honestly i thought the show was great. Made me look back at my own recent teenage years and come to terms with some of the emotions i was feeling and gave me closure of some feelings that spilled into my adult life since I understand now everyone goes through it. The show had to be extremely blunt to show how extreme the emotions and feelings of puberty can be.
I like the show and it's sister series is good too.
I’m still pissed off inside job got canceled
Sorry, i don't like the show. It's garbage.
what is the music at 11:16 ?
Big Marth?
This guy's Canadian valley girl accent makes my ears bleed
31:35 complete copy of South Park. There are many other copies of family guy South Park the Simpsons and more in this show but somehow it’s still garbage
I’m here to comment “yes. It is that bad and always has been since episode 1”😂
I never understood how people related to this show. It always seemed like it was trying too hard or outright just being disgusting.
i was 10 in 2017 when big mouth came out…. i’m turning 18 in 4 months 😃 it sounds true and simple but it feels so impossible
Ngl, coach steve was my favorite and I like much of this show. End me if you must
I will absolutely say that the Velma show's animation was very good, and the absolute high point of the show, the animation team is not to blame for any of it, in fact, if there were anything able to redeem it(spoiler alert: nothing can), it would be their work. The problem lies in the writing staff, and especially... Mindy. I'm really glad that people are starting to see through her, and not like her, now, because of it, especially because of how insufferable a self-insert that SHE HERSELF put into the show, ended up being.
I thought that the Caleb seeing Maury thing was that he was able to see him, because he's autistic, whereas most people usually can't, which I actually thought to be a pretty funny throwaway joke.
I, and this is nothing against Nick Kroll, I'm sure that he's a wonderful person, and I know, or at least have heard that Big Mouth was bankrolledby his rich parents(or maybe just his father?), so it doesn't apply to this show, but his voice is SO grating, and his attempts at voice acting just makes it worse. I do not understand why people keep using his voice for things that weren't personally bankrolled by his parents.
Heard this is drake's favorite show
I'm up to S5 E2 and I think it's alright🤷🏾‍♀. I totally get why the nudity and stuff is a problem, it's all baby powder to me but for some it doesn't stop there. I think I'd let my kid watch and just PG it. There's enough good stuff in there.
Background music kinda distracting
I don't love Big Mouth just because you never see the characters truly grow and it's just a mess to look at. I don't relate to it but I'm an adult, so maybe it's been too long (though I'm only 22) but the idea of putting a random 12 year old in front of it is weird because of the adult references and humor. It's the show that's technically for adults but stars kids, like a Euphoria. It's mature enough to be worrying that kids watch it and explicit enough with the child characters to be worrying that adults watch it.
I liked season 1. thought it was funny..... watched season 2... thought it was weird pedophile show.
" big mourth"
You couldnt convince me to watch this slop show
I loved Inside Job and was honestly really sad it got cancelled. But sure, give Big Mouth another season and hey, why not make an entire new show with the same people while you're at it
"Shame" wizard. Ok wow that took me three google searches to get.
Inside job deserved better
i feel like big mouth is more of a comedy, looking too deep into the lore is like over analyzing south park or family guy
I loved the first 2 seasons, and thought they were great about the topic of puberty.  But now its just unfun to watch and doesnt feel like its caring to be about purberty anymore. Plus, the humor just got so bad.
This video title could be answered in one word: “Yes”.
I just watched the first episode *uncensored and... I'm totally going to see where it goes. It might be another safe choice for my kids🤔
I feel like it's a chiller and less serious version of sex education
just propaganda children get through nextflicks
I gotta say this, on top of the voice acting and songs, I like Big Mouth for how well it tackles subjects like puberty, discovering your sexuality and gender identity, family issues, emotional availability, and the importance of consent incredibly well, and their representation does get a lot better further into the series (I don't like Caleb, as hes an autistic stereotype and I'm autistic, but they've seriously turned his representation around in the last season). Though, I can understand if people are uncomfortable with it because it is centered around mainly minors (something that made me very uncomfortable with the show), or if you hate it for it getting more seasons than shows that are better. Human Resources is a bit better on that front, tackling toigh subjects, but focused around adults.
Just seeing thumbnail, yes, yes it is
I just hate the adult animation trope of ugly animation. I love animation and i wanna see what it can do. Shitty animation will make me drop a show (partly why i cant get into Smiling friends, which i want to like) and good animation draws me in so much quicker than a good story because a good story almost always has a slow start
Sad part bout the show is embarrassing to say the pillows and coach cushions really how guys would do before loation and sock is taught
Show came out during being in highschool had enjoyed some spinach with my homie and tha girlwe both wanted but i let him have her cause i knew who was better for her and she would throw it in his face anyway when i found the show i just put her baby to sleep so they could dod what they was gone do and all ended up literally enjoying more spinach and talking bout bout how it reminded all of us growing up
Personally I loved and enjoyed the first few seasons of Big Mouth . . . . But if I could get more seasons of Inside Job I'd betray big mouth in a heartbeat.
Idk man, i dont care about the art but i just dont feel right watching a bunch of the situations they put you in
It's so hideous I'm never gonna even bother giving it a try.
The monsters are a metaphor they don’t actually exist and when people acknowledge them as characters that’s the joke. Nobody can see them but you.
In short, YES…IT IS that Bad.
Big marth
Yes
what fucking accent do you have
Yes
Bro trying to micro analyse a show made for stoners 😂😂 good video tho ngl you cooked
14:42 lmao they defo would😭😭
Wait if Missy has both a white and a black parent, why is it an issue she was voiced by a white woman? That sounds equally as appropriate as getting a black woman to voice her tbh
A lot of these are super great concepts! I wish they were in a completely different show made by competent people!
14:48 lmao you could not be more wrong tbh
34:05 does Matthew have green eyes??
whats the song at 36:20
Also feel like going this in depth to something you have a previous negative attitude toward rarely leads to good things and i honesty dont understand how big mouth has the Same mainstream rep early episodes of family guy American dad and simpsons had with Republicans its wild
Defending rick and morty and deconstructing big mouth is wild this is adult show made for like edgey 15 year olds and depressed adults.
did this get deleted??
It makes me uncomfortable tbh, my favourite shows on netflix get cancelled for borderline shit shows, like how th3y cancelled 'I AM NOT OKAY WITH THIS' for ginny and georgia, or 'Dead end paranormal park' for bigmouth,
this show is a straight master piece
So, honestly I'm only 10 minutes into this video, but in regards to all the criticisms you 've laid out so far, I totally understand. To be critical of the show and now it puts forth its premise and characters, that's honestly totally fine, but for my own personal standpoint, I was never really that critical of the show. Show. I kind of just went with the fact that it was going to be ridiculous in most ways while being laced with a little bit of reality here and there. I think in that sense, the show is supposed to be a little chaotic, possibly being representative of how during those formative years. Years that's how it felt for a lot of people. I definitely still don't like the animation style, I agree with most people when they say that it's ugly, but the show is undeniably funny most of the time. Does the gag humor go a little bit too far, sure. Of the imagery is a little over the top, but honestly that's kind of the point. A lot of gross and uncomfortable things. Growing up that now we've just come to see as normal.
The people that like this show deserve to get weird looks.
Big Marth
I really like the first two seasons when it came out but after that I felt it ran it’s course
Yes
As a teen going to high school soon who has rewatched big mouth 3 times and I’ve also watch Human Resources, I find it very relatable and it makes me realize certain and feelings and ways you thing are ok
Yes. Saved you 55m
Big Mouth won an Emmy and Better Call Saul didn't. Just think about that.
Never finished the show cause plotless comedy isn't really my thing, but what threw me off the most were the characters themselves. I honestly just dislike shows where everyone is a mean jerk. I always found every Big Mouth character unlikeable. Plus I hate how the show tries to take itself seriously in random momets, just to make a dumb joke again later. Either go fully ridiculous and don't respect the characters or actually take the story seriously.
If i was a a teenager I probably would have liked it but I was already 18 when the show came out.
I can't past the Canadian pronunciation of "way" at the 4:58' mark... It's killing me 😆😆☠️
Me watching this while eating my factor dinner  😮
Im ngl I usually agree with you but thay first part is kinda just a misunderstanding. They cant all see muarie, caleb seeing him is a bit. They dont see eachothers monsters and the monsters themselves are almost godly so they have control over people and can be in two places at once. Im nit saying the show is kino lol i dont think so at all but i think the complaint about the how the monsters function is silly
I was genuinely upset when I found out inside job was canceled
Big mouth is hilarious
it's bad? I swear y'all wake up and decide something is bad. The show has always been great.
Yeah, Human Resources is so much more entertaining than Big Mouth. The 'Monsters' are intriguing.
Mark: you know what you should shove in your big mouth  Me: automatically your Dick lol I have a dirty gay mind 😅
I really wished they made the cast grow up throughout the seasons bc, some of the situations they go through just don't make any sense if they're just 13 year olds.
Might be the outrageous of the explicit sexuality if puberty of underage kids is a bit much but a lot of what was happening I experienced as a child and it being personified makes it less embarrassing that I was the only one since society made it seem that kids going through puberty has to be a certain ways all the time. It is a adult cartoon after all and more comedic than serious
i remember watching like three seasons of this show and there were a handful of good jokes for no absolute reason, like the time andrew and his hormone monster were talking about Mathew McConney “banging some chicks” and Maurice said “let’s try and not think about aids” then two seconds later was like “andrew, i’m thinking about aids”. or when Jay had this weird relationship with the pillow but like he said something to his friends about NOT doing the deed with a pillow and his friends were just like “huh?” like the small, funny moments are sometimes a hit, but almost 98% of the time it’s SOOO ass. i didn’t even finish season three because of the humor and the story
Nitpicking, I dunno if your didn't go through puberty or what but, your opinion is NOT based. Big mouth is great
Yeah kinda
the only cartoon that accurately reflects being high is american dad in that episode where stan and roger get high
You never have anything positive to say. It's getting annoying.
Can we just please stop using Rotten Tomatoes as the anointed authority of Movie and TV credibility and preeminence?  Everyone knows by now exactly how this site opperates... There is no way to trust the process anymore, especially after the admission of so many "critics" of receiving preferential treatment, perks, and even cash rewards for high ratings and glowing reviews.  Nobody should even consider this sham web site anymore when the my need to find if a movie is worh it or not.
Short answer to the title of the video: Yes, it's awful. Awful artstyle, lazy animation, terrible plot, none of the jokes are funny, the characters are unbearable for the most part, and the premise in theory sounds okay but in execution comes off out of touch and borderline creepy most the time (if the writers were teenagers, maybe it wouldn't be so bad, but adults writing a show about kids having sex and masturbating is just... weird). Overall 2/10 at the most
I feel like all your criticisms lead to one key point this show wasn’t written for a person like you
the tekken ost is funny to hear here idk why
first watched it when I was in year 7 I learnt so much it was educational and humorous and accurate about how growing up feels as u become a teen. I’m 17 now I still watch the show on repeat after I finish it
List of words Marks accent disables him from saying Say Gay Jay May Way  Lol I'm just making fun but I'm playing a game while listening to this and I can't help but look over at my phone when he says whey or jeh or geh
Yeah. I think people are just frustrated something they don't like gets so many seasons where other contain they do enjoy, is dropped. But that's not Big Mouths fault. It's a decision by the company and if a show is doing well, brings in the views, than it's going to stay. I mean, look at Velma. It happens.   That being said, I'm actually a big fan of Big Mouth and the different topics they cover. I liked Human Resources too since to me at least, the most interesting aspect of Big Mouth is the monsters who represent emotions or body changes and how to handle them.  I even liked the idea hormone monsters don't have to match their human because we do have feminine guys/girls and everyone's level of horiness is very different. Heck, we get a asexual character later who has a hormone monster who isn't very hyper sexual at all, just talking to their human about what he wants to try. I really liked that.   ~~  But of course, I can understand the show not being for everyone and how it isn't the best written show. It is mostly just a lot of unexpected jokes for shock value and experimental of visuals which I guess is enough for me
What gets me more than anything isn't the animation, it's the voice acting. They don't sound or talk like 11-12yr old kids, they all sound like jaded 30-something year olds and its super offputting. I don't hear the joy & confusion of figuring out transforming childhood to adulthood, I just hear Adults thinking they're being so surface-level edgy like _"Oooooh look how shocking we are talking, about butts! And Bisexuals! And Bisexual Butts! Ohh, we're sooooo going against the grid! Look at this pansexual 12yr old girl explicitly tell everyone how she wants to do the fuck on everyone, sooooo awkward, Lolololol"_
I think the ugly art style is better than an appealing one. You don’t want to watch a show where they make the children attractive while doing sexual things. It would feel like pandering to soft core (borderline straight up) pedo pron lovers. I’ve always thought the ugly style was intentional, to make you go “ewww yuck, gross kids” instead of being thrown off by “attractive” designs for sexual children.
INSIDE JOB MENTIONED
its a HUGE missed opportunity they didn't go with exploring making Nick trans or at least gender questionng to explain why the hormone monstress is suddeny guiding him. Like, seriously, they fucked with the status quo a few times so why no? it would at least be more intreresting than just the same shit the other characters are doing.
37:17
They canceled Bojack Horseman but kept Big Mouth. Rip
I want to see a part 2!!!
Honestly I just cannot stand the show. It is quite literally a EDP445 show
I've watched one episode of this. There was nothing relatable, it was just very... Ugly. Like one of those low-effort pieces of modern art. Or a lewd song from the band "KISS". It almost seems like the same kinds of people are behind all of them. Weird.
The earlier seasons were pretty good but after season 4 it's kinda meh
Yes it’s bad
Can't stand for all this big mout hatred
Love the videos but I think I'll listen to this one, it's not you it's the show lol
I kinda liked big mouth, but not the nudity, and I’ve never laughed at a single joke in this show.
Personally I like big mouth but it is probably because I am a teenager and I can relate to this stuff more than other people
Inside job being cancelled is still a fresh wound
ig I'm one of the rare people who actually enjoyed all of big mouth. Or maybe I'm just a big Nick Kroll and John Mulaney fan....
Never heard of Big Marth.. :P
Short Answer yes
I wonder if it getting renewed has to do with nick krolls (the guy who created the show) dad is a literal billionaire. Maybe hes giving money to the right people.
As someone who likes big mouth the running theme of the show is that their conclusions are a fucking mess. I also think because everyone commends them for being taboo, that when they can’t figure out a punchline they go to gross out humour in the worst ways (Andrew yanking in front of his gpa’s corpse). When that’s not what people are commending, they like the gross things that hold truth, that most humans experience. So because about half the show is pretty real and funny, I stick with it
Ill never forgive netflix for keeping this piece of shit over tucking inside job
I’ll say that I would be way more willing to watch it if it had internal rules and actually lived in the world it created
in all honesty the spinoff series "Human resources" is much better than big mouth
Its just weird and they stretched it too long
first season was kind of funny. second season was kind of... pedo-ish. didn't watch much of second season when they showed naked children.
can we leave actors using their normal voice for “voice acting” behind?
How the fuck do you get an r in the word mouth
I’ve never heard anybody say anything negative about this show before, seems like you’re a hater
big marth
just won a grammy
big mouth is quite literally my favorite show
13:40 bro thinks he's nepeta leijon
1:47 rotten tomatoes pays their critics to review movies in a positive light and visa versa, it’s the reason cuties was “critically acclaimed.” It wasn’t.
my brother likes this show so thats a plus about it
Calling big mouth a spawn of Satan is a laughable comment when Mr. Pickles exists.
I love big mouth. i rewatched it 5 times
I think this show is unliked because people see it as an adult animation while I feel its more directed at pre-teens and teens going through purberty, I was 12 when this show started and have been watching since then. I feel its relatable and talks about the topics no one wants to talk about at that age of puberty.
I feel like the show had something at the beginning, like a drama/comedy that I could relate to but it quickly devolved into gross humor and nonsense
I genuinely think the characters look ugly because if the characters looked human, the creators would be arrested
Icl big mouth is jokes
I’m ngl I kinda liked the obvious parts of the show where they explain things. As it can be educational and helpful, except for the fact that the Netflix rating is 18s meaning it’s directed towards adults.
i think the reason i hate the show so much was mainly the humour. it was mainly shock, meta and gross out, the three humours i hate the most (plus i can't stand the art style)
Bro didn't get any of the jokes
Yes yes it is
This show always looked like trash to me and I'm glad to watch it get roasted
me personally i’m 16 and like big mouth. it’s crude and whatever but it shows the awkward parts of growing up that i can relate too even though i’m a few years older than the characters. i also think that the ugly depictions of puberty would’ve helped me feel not so alone had i seen it at 12 lol
Why u watching comedy for plot?
you'd think a show with as bad a reputation as this one would be met with better faith criticism than nitpicking the times when the non diagetic allegory isnt consistant, jesus christ
just started the video and already know i cant take “big marth” seriously
I somewhat like big mouth i watch it when new seasons are dropped and sometimes when im bored but finding out that inside job got cancelled before this pisses me off
My guess is the show is "critically acclaimed" because it pushes the narratives that Hollywood and film critics like.
I watched the entire series of bigmouth, and I found myself sometimes being interested when it tackled actual issues. and absolutely despising the show when it revolved around Andrew and Nick, two of the most unlikable characters I’ve ever seen. And when all of its humor is just sexualizing children. Don’t get me started on human resources. The worst spin off I’ve ever seen in history. Overall, the show is.. okay. The reason I think I hate it so much is because actual good shows get canceled and a big mouth just keeps on going.
Yes it is
big marth? I'm sorry. are you saying Pam, or Pan?
The show literally called itself “animated child pornography”…. Period. End of story.
the "big MwAITH" is stressing me out
I'm 36 minutes in and I don't have much skin in the game, but I agree with the criticisms and the praises mentioned so far.  I still thought Farzar, Paradise PD and Inside Job did better at being generally entertaining adult animated comedies, all of which were axed after one or two seasons, but I'd say that Big Mouth wasn't terrible and could sometimes be entertaining.   I don't think they did anything ground-breaking or pushed boundaries at all with their political takes, and in-fact many shows nowadays (Specially on Netflix) take the same political stance. I would argue that a show would push boundaries further by taking the opinion that both political sides are stupid or cracking jokes at both political leanings, but maybe I'm alone on that thought.  My opinion / criticism on it is that it was definitely unique in art-style, the comedy and story aspects are off-beat a lot, but had entertaining points. The comedy wasn't great, but the stories could keep you entertained for the length of an episode, which can't be said for current-day Family Guy, American Dad, Simpsons or the Futurama reboot. It was definitely unique in what it did, but I wouldn't go out of my way to renew my Netflix subscription for it.
yes
20:09 I think a show that goes a bit far in its sexual nature is pretty ballsy and honestly needed, a lot of sexual things are treated with such delicacy nowadays that the idea of even having “sex” is such a taboo and awkward topic amongst people that it really needed to have a show that wouldn’t tiptoe around the subject in any way. Going through fetishes, talking about and using the human body parts in unique ways, I really feel like they do a good job at really digging into the nitty gritty that most other cartoons would vehemently stay away from. It’s a little wild but, I think it works.
I actually enjoy Big Mouth, I do remember when it was mad popular though lmao. It was a huge thing back in middle school.
I love big mouth
I’m not gon lie I think big mouth is good and I think your just kind of a loser who sits around and watches cartoons all day so you don’t really understand how its supposed to be an extreme spin off of a normal persons life during puberty. Like people who go outside and do stuff like a parody of their lives. I also think the show really only works if you are gen z
some seasons are decent others are dog shit. ide say 3/10
if glitch techs got cancelled for big mouth im gonna commit 10/11
I'm just annoyed that such a mediocre show is still going while really good shows like Inside Job are getting canceled after 1 season. it bothers me that so much time and money is going to this show.   plus I really dislike the way the more sexual topics are handled. I'm fine with them being talked about, I think its an important part of growing up and shouldn't be avoided, but the show treats the sexual exploration of teens less as a character growth moment and more like a gross out gag. knowing how I and some of my friends were with topics like this when we were kids, I see that doing more harm then good to the teens who are watching.
mark what the hell is this soundtrack
Yeah so since you didn't mention it in the intro, I don't even need to watch the rest of the video. It's a bad show because it shows naked children. Nuff said.
E
I like big mouth but I love Human Resources but if keeping big mouth means other shows have to get canceled I’d rather have the other shows if that makes sense
"big marth"
its just bad writing and  written for millenials not younger people. 7 seasons on andd a plot point is still "weve ran out of script lets just have andrew jerk off weirdly"
Men can go through female puberty, and women can go through male puberty  It's rare, but it happens
Big mouth should be canceled, it's shit, why is it continuing while Inside Job is canceled?
So you fired a woman for being white? That's racist.
Murdering babies is evil. That's it.
I'm glad to see that other people are tired of everything being meta, it was cool at first but I'm tired of it and want most things to not be meta. I don't mind just a few things being meta but only if it does something new with being meta and finds a cool new way to use it, other than that, just stop being meta, a self contained story is more satisfying at this point and I'm glad to see others are agreeing now.
Rotten Tomatoes is absolute bullshit, and should not be used as a metric for quality at all, it's completely wrong
As for a serial that is meant to be for adults but kind of for teenagers, with the puberty thing i tried to watch it with my 16 year old friend and he was absolutely disgusted by how they are portraying masturbation and sex. Even though they aren't trying to shame the idea they make it so comedic for the shock value it's more like "haha! I masturbate all the time and never stop!" Which not only defeats the point of the show, it brings discomfort to many teenagers about their body.
The animation style makes Cocomelon look good.
obviously its bad its legitimate child porn
I genuinely like Bigmouth and 1 too many episodes actually made me laugh. I need to check out Human Resources
If it wasn’t for the huge child-orgy (and a couple smaller things), I would have never fallen off because this show came around in my early twenties. I had just stepped out of puberty and was able to relate to and look back and laugh on the things the kids were going through because I had recently gone through them too, albeit to a lesser extent. But I think the show got a bit too cocky (see what I did there?) they tried to push the envelope and eventually pushed the fanbase until it broke.
As unbelievable as it sounds I consider the show an incredible sex ed resource for middle schoolers and I've always kind of assumed that was the intention behind it. I think it does really well at that one specific thing without just being raw educational content, and it's exactly decent enough someone that age can watch it - I never thought they intended to actually make a good coming of age story or anything. However, the overall graphicness of some of the depictions probably makes a lot of parents not okay with it for that purpose?
For the hormone monster not being exclusive for each kid, I think it's a metaphor of types of people, or groups even. You see when you go further into the history you have Maury who is absolutely crude, but semi-average and basic type of puberty 'for boys', Connie being the truly emotional and 100% 'girl energy', Mona who is absolutely openly all for being sexually active and try out all the possibilities or Rick who is the epitome of all the things wrong with hormones and with no possibility of change whatsoever. For me, they perfectly depict different types of personalities that ppl do depict and how they. No to mention that the idea of hormone monsters taking care of kids both genders can reference to the idea of embracing your masculine/feminine side As for the show itself-for me personally, those mistakes you've  pointed have it's charm because they depict the whole 'being a teenager' as chaotic and some kind of hazy dream we do or don't remember. Nothing makes sense, everything is 'just because'. And you must remember that because it's based of memories of the guys, some situations like, battling with depression, might be shown as a memory. Plus - puberty IS uncomfortable. It's disgusting, it's crass because you learn do's a don'ts, you smell because of the hormones, body odor and getting the hang of the hygene (pls don't tell me ALL of the teens are squeaky clean and always smell mint and flowers, because we all know it's not true), everything hurts because of growing pains, your body is changing and you in this weird twilight phase where some of your body parts are grown up and some are still kid like so you really often lack proportions and look like an alien. There was not one part in my body during puberty that I've liked- but not because of complexes or other social shit. I was in constant pain- if not from growing, then from periods. And the smell- let me tell you how absolutely my hormones DESTROYED every shirt I've owned, because of the sweat - at some point I just had to take soap, deodorant and at least 2 shirts, because it was so bad. And the list went on and on- it was absolutely horrible and I'm glad I'm in my adult body.  And as for the different somewhat uncomfortable closeups, look - teens can mess their body pretty bad, because of experimenting and the shame there is when they have to ask their parents for help sometimes holds them down from asking- which (and I'm saying this as a female presenting person) might lead to grown women not going to OB GYN even with deep yeast infections or simply being able to talk with their kids about sex ed. And honestly- if this crass shit will help a kid or a grown up talk about genital-related problems - so be it. For example, for me, Sex Education was far more uncomfortable and I still cannot lay my finger on why was that.
this show was super informative to me in my growing years,  it may not be perfect but its supposed to be light hearted and when they do the deep stuff they do it pretty well this show gets way too much hate its just andrew hes a creep
Was bored recently and didn’t have any series to watch on Netflix so put on an episode to see if I like. I’m on season 2 so far and can say I love it even tho I’m 25. The chaotic and some of the outrageous jokes they make is my kinda humour. It’s not too serious either with its rules so you don’t know what to expect. I can see how it’s relatable while but honestly it’s just best to enjoy the ride and not deep the show too much.
Two of the clips you showed made me understand why it still reviews well despite being generally hated. The people who ARE watching it are either there for it making anti-SJW jokes, or are there because they're pedophiles. Very few people who fall outside of either camp are watching it, and those are mostly going to be people who just watch any adult animated comedy no matter how slop it is. And even those people seem to not universally like the slop.
Yes it is that bad, cuz i cant sit through anymore of this seven minutes in...
i hate the way he says mouth
The show's need to personify everything is a signal to me that they don't know how to actually handle their own themes and need a crutch
I just don't like the art style
you spent an hour to say the word yes? Cringe
When I was on the road with my family to South Carolina myrtle Beach I watched season 1-3 and enjoyed every second of it 😂😂
Yes it is.
Big Mouth is fucking awesome
What country is LS Mark from exactly? He sounds American or Canadian most of the time but then suddenly he'll sound like he's some Baltic English as a second language dude for a few seconds out of nowhere and I don't think he's doing a bit
I'd say it's an ok show with good episodes sometimes. Obviously it's probably been there because Nick Kroll's dad is a billionaire who's greasing some pockets but I also think Nick Kroll is talented and funny on his own so it's a case of nepotism that doesn't really piss me off much
Honestly, as an early teen when Big Mouth came out, I loved it. I learned more about puberty in the show than I ever did in sex Ed. Don’t watch it anymore, I’m an adult now and I feel like it would be pretty weird to watch it, but I do like how it never shys away from the awkward reality of puberty. Heck, I started my period a few days before I watched the Jessie in the New York episode.
It’s ‘p
32:45 not sure if it was intentional but the plot of that episode is basically ripped from an episode of Community.
What is your accent? Or do you have a speech impediment? I'll be listening to you talk and it will sound so normal and then you'll randomly pronounce something super strangely. I can't tell if you're doing it intentionally or not because you don't appear to have an accent 99% of the time
Racism is bad. We may have fired an actress just because she's white, but racism is bad.
‘and this guy they hang around called jear’
Cancel culture is so fucking dumb if you don't like it don't watch it. It's called freedom of speech.  I forgot a large part, roughly 50% of the population don't like free speach. Seeing how moat Twitter users were so mad Elon Musk wanted it to stop being bias and have freedom of speach, causing 59% of the US population to get belligerent and hypocritical.
Cancel culture is so fucking dumb if you don't like it don't watch it. It's called freedom of speach.
If you’re also going through puberty then it’s a obviously a good show. Cuz it supposed to show the struggles of puberty
this show is animated cp its fucking nasty
Yes, it is. Next question.
you clearly didn't watch or understand everything lmao
I know im late but…can I get a tracklist please 😭
The big mouth animation style reminds me of that show Little Bill.
No, its worse
23:45 idk if it's because of your accent or I just don't know this word, but what is this wizard? I'm hearing "The sheam wizard", but I've never heard the word sheam, sorry if it's your accent, I do really love it, I'm just kinda bad at understanding certain words edit: nvm I'm so stupid he's saying Shame
out of all the cancelations that happen, the only one that really makes me angry is Inside Job. that show was so so SO good, and season 2's ending was wild. why in the FUCK did they cancel it after season 2. that ending was so good :(
41:06 what’s the song ?
I tried to give big mouth a chance, its a star studded voice acting cast of talented comedians and when they are performing comedy bits its great.. its the long downtime between funny parts where things are pompously being virtue signaled to you that kills it for me. Also i feel theres a lack of identity despite having such a unique theme. Most jokes, situations and humor are clearly 17+ being written by and voice acted by adults but it seems like the "lessons" as well as some of the lingo and talking points are decidedly youth oriented like for people just starting puberty but the show is rated for people 17+ and it leaves me with a feeling of "whos this for exactly" Like one second they are complaining about puberty the next they are making seinfeld references.
i clicked on the wrong video, i wanted a vid about big mouth not big marth
Coach Steve is the only character worth a shit in this series
Controversial take, but I don't think the show's survived this long because of any merit of its own. It's solely because Nick Kroll wanted a show, and his dad's a multi-billionaire, so Nick got what he wanted.
How do you manage to sound Irish, Jamaican, and Americanized English at the Same time? Your voice is hard to listen to dog but good job
big mouth is kind of like a comfort show for me,  whenever i'm feeling down i just rewatch big mouth.
big mouth came out when i was in middle school, and I remember watching it and thinking "I didn't know this is how everyone else felt too" it definitely has its issues, like the minor nudity, but its become some kind of a comfort show for me lmfao
i liked it, i found it pretty funny and i enjoy how they handle subjects, even if it is overly crass, so is growing up and life is just crass. its normal. yall know puberty is similar to how they portray it. growing up is gross and scary.
I refuse to watch it
Im sorry, but this show just looks plain awful 😅
Growing up I matured a lot faster than my best friend, like I don't think he hit puberty until late high school. At least in my experience this show does not portray what it's like to have that difference in a friendship. Bringing your best friend to hang out with other people and them asking why you hang out with such an immature person. Wanting to talk about crushes and changes but your friend has no way to relate to you. Getting into a relationship and your friend not understanding why you'd want to be with them sometimes. And worst of all the shame you feel when you find yourself being a worse friend because you can't keep hanging out with someone who acts so childish and wishing they could just be where you are in life with you.  In Big Mouth this barely causes any conflict between them two
Yes.
You have a very unique voice you could be a voice actor for big mouth even
Yes.
good to know ur a pothead
They want these monsters to be Rodger SO bad
Seasons 1,2 are kinda great. It's downhill very fast from there
I had to stop watching Big Mouth when they had two female underage characters be topless and visible from the front, it just felt so icky and I couldn't go back. I did feel it had its moments before then, but that was too much for me. However, "I'M A DUMPTRUCK" lives rent free in my head. Such a mood.
You say the word "mouth" weird
You have to watch the show with the same lens as Rick and Morty. Rules don’t matter, everything is crafted for the jokes and the “story” of that one episode. Just watch and be entertained and sometimes enjoy the deeper meaning/relatable moments.
Love big mouth
Laser pointers are really entertaining
The show has potential to be good and relatable it can be but just all the crude sex jokes and ugly artstyle is so bad I hate it. I definitely prefer Human Resources it did a better job of explaining the rules and the monsters, but definitely not the best- Big mouth had a chance to be good but they dumped on it
F is got family is so sweet ngl
Inside job>>>>>
i think the art style is meant to be gross because everyone kinda was during puberty. a lot of the hate that comes from this show like the kids are just horrible hormonal devils and it's gross forgets that that's what puberty was for a lot of us. it was horrible and gross and we were all hormonal and cringe and looking back on it probably weren't the best people.   the hormone monsters don't need logic as they're a metaphor for the kids hormones which won't make sense to them because they're kids and still figuring shit out, it's confuses the audience because it's just as confusing to the kids. i think a lot of people forget what an awkward time puberty was and especially for the first few years when you really aren't in control of your body and it's scary.   the supernatural stuff can get a little annoying but i think it is meant to have a purpose. the supernatural episode is hyperbolises theyre dreams. andrew wants to be invisible so he can do all his pervert stuff nick wants to be big so he can change size jessie just wants to not be lied to as a kid going through mental health problems. the switching body episodes was just a badly done "put yourself in someone else's shoes" kind of thing  all in all the show in my opinion perfectly demonstrates what an awkward and awful time puberty was. is there room for improvement and criticism? yes but it doesn't change the core aspects of the show that i think a lot of people miss without knowing context of the whole series or who don't remember what puberty was really like
you cannot convince me andrew isnt the protagonist instead of nick
I like big mouth 🥲
(SPOILERS)Season 1-3:The best seasons of The show (Season 1 obviously) Season 3 had a sad ending but still good  Season 4-5;Different but (kinda) getting better little weird tho I love the Jay and Mathew arc.season 5 gave me Season 1 vibes a little  Season 6:Pretty good had a good ending to it. Season 7: not how I expected it but I'm glad the kids are now in high school They continued the Jay and Lola arc
Before I watch the video: yes, it is bad.
Inside Job was a literal masterpiece, the characters were so fun and unique and it was genuinely funny. Plud the artstyle was unique. I can't believe big mouth gets spinoffs and high ratings but inside job gets... cancelled before they finish a full arc.
Just wondering, why is every western adult animation has an ugly charcter?,,,, if it ain't ugly, it's gross,,, like it's all coded in them.
the hormone monsters are just demons/jinn that are influencing the characters impulses & emotions
It's  not good but hey glad you folks who like mid show with ugle animation are satiated.  Lol😜
Big Mouth is horrible
the big mouth kids are not teens lmao they look 8 they're like 3 feet tall
Idc what anyone says I think it's funny. I'm not normally one for raunchy shows but I like it 🤷🏼‍♀️
I'd like Factor a lot more if it didn't cost almost $20/meal in my area due to "Shipping and Handling" AKA the shipping and "generic fee" they didn't want to include in the base price because no one would fall for it if they saw the real price up front.
beg maurth
The show looks like garbage, lazy ugly, and a bad story. It's a Jewish masterpiece ☠️
It hit me at some point that it’s interesting that this show targets an adult audience, trying to let them laugh about the struggles they had as a kid in retrospect, because I think an idea like a hormone monster influencing kids through puberty is a great way to help kids get that idea
season 1 was good but it became terrible afterwards. Season 3 was so bad i couldn't watch it anymore. Did they change writers?
big marth
I think you lack the capacity to understand cartoon logic. Please stop looking into it that deeply.
The hormone monsters are personal, but shared in understanding. A big part of puberty is everyone kinda knowing what everyone else is going through, but not fully knowing if it's exactly the same for others. Two people having Maury as the monster are essentially experiencing a similar experience whereas having another monster is a different experience.
They really missed an opportunity to make a good show that actually could help kids go through puberty more confidently. Like for real, what if they removed all the disgusting shit and stopped showing the genitalia of minors (fucking disgusting they should be ashamed) and instead made it like a pg13 show, keep some of the raunchy/toilet humor for comedy sake, and just actually made it a show about getting through puberty from the perspective of people with experience, while still keeping the more fantastical stuff like the monsters and wizards or whatever. Stop focusing on the gross shit like that kid fucking his pillow and couch and shit, don't show underage dick and vagina, give everyone their own unique hormone monster/shame wizard/whatever the fuck, and make a show that pubescent teens can actually fuckin relate to. But nah, showing a 13 year old talking to her vagina is epic I guess lmao.
those who cannot do teach those who cannot teach just judge  long story short became a youtuber and be that guy who judges anything but does not do anything else
yo what the fuck accent is this?
i wish they kept the nick and jessi romance, i really enjoyed it and i wish they did more with it after jessi's whole new school experience. i just miss when they didn't cast jessi to the side lol
I've seen a few ep.'s and all i kept thinking was: Who is this show for? The premise and themes are about coming of age and the struggles of puberty, but it's content is way too graphic and adult restricted to target teens/pre-teens. So is it supposed to be nostalgia for adults? So then why does it try to be so instructive and focus so much on coping with the bodily changes and social dynamics that comes with puberty? It tries to act as a guide to navigate this awkward time of life, but what are adults to get from this? Is it for parents as a reminder of what kids go thru? Maybe? I just don't know who this show is trying to reach.
its just another jewish made show to trash the yougsters mind. adults clearly hate it but if they still do it its because someone watches
In my opinion, Andrew is the worst character and brings down the show, he constantly has to learn the same lesson over and over again, and he is painfully unfunny. Not to say that the rest of the show is any better Andrew is just the worst offender.
I think the majority of these criticisms are humongously stupid, irrelevant, and unnecessary, however the fact that bit mouth was on screen for 56 minutes and this video is surrounded entirely around big mouth is precisely the only reason I enjoyed this video XD
it sexulised minors
Big Marth
The only thing ppl have on this shoe is that they’re literally sexualizing kids no matter how you try to explain it away lol and that’s pretty hard to argue. They have adult voices and I don’t ever get any ick from it but technically they were middle schoolers
I think excessive comedy and lack of seriousness you describe actually helps this show to deliver the educational messages. Sex education media has a problem of being very awkward and it's usually hard to watch. I think all the stupid jokes help to take all these topics easier and process it. The plot makes a lot more sense if you just take everything supernatural as a one big metaphor.
I thought that the show was eh ok but when Nick Kroll was inserted in that office it was so dumb
Big Mouth is making up for about 150 years of sexual and emotional repression in the western world. You might not like the crass humor, the weird art style, or the candid tone of the fictional underage characters... but our culture doesn't teach sexuality or emotional awareness because we think it's taboo. If this show doesn't relate to you on a deeply personal level, you've lived your life under a rock.  We've never had a show like this before. Don't watch it if you don't want to. Just be glad someone made it so we can start healing from all this puritanical hatred toward our own biology! Future generations will be grateful even if this one isn't.
Oh god wait 3min in and it's an hour video ok yea naw I'm good 🤣
my mom walked in on me watching this video at a weird scene and I'm fucked
The hormone monsters are explained as the show progresses
I think overall people forget that Big Mouth DOES NOT take its serious or whatever people think of the show.
I'm not gonna pretend I watched the video because I haven't, I don't feel like it, but I think Big Mouth is an incredibly overhated show with a lot of genuine merit. It's not particularly funny, most jokes fall flat or are just mildly amusing, but it makes up for it with meaningful and empathetic stories about growing up and learning how to human, and actually really solid sex education. I think the mistake people are making is approaching it as a comedy show, which it fails to be. Approach it like a literal sex ed class and you'll find a lot to love about it.
YES
Just by the title, yes. Every single random scene I’ve watched of this atrocious show has made me gag. It’s DISGUSTING.
yeah it kinda bothers me when they give male characters fat pouting lips like that
BRUH lemme explain the netflix equation.  50 < 2 posts 50 new options. in a yearly quarter less then 5 are worth clicking.  notice how i said OPTIONS and not shows. because a show implies there's something to see; option are what you put on to fall asleep
13:10 not to play devils advocate but Maury said he was religious and against sex etc, because for the first half of the episode andrew hadn’t been jerking off, it was in response to that and then when Maury loses it, andrew climaxes and the earth quake happens, but it was all a dream, a wet dream
Exercise does help alleviate depression, I'm not sure why you're cringing so hard over the suggestion.
The jokes are obvious and lazy The "funny characters" are abrasive and unfunny There is literally no acceptable target audience.  Too adult for the kids who would relate to it, too weirdly sexual with the minor characters and weak with the jokes for adults It's made for the stupid masses, which is why it's bad but well received
Short answer no.
I think people are reading too much into it. I absolutely LOVE the show. I know it can be extremely stupid sometimes, but I just look past it, cause I don’t really care if it makes sense. It’s fucking funny!
as someone going through puberty currently, i love big mouth, its relatable, funny, and makes me feel less alone. It also taught me a LOT about my body, more than my parents ever did
I have been a stan of Big Mouth since day 1 and I LOVE Human Resources!! I love the simple animation, the over-the-top ness of the story lines and it has so many layers to it. I quote it all the time!
To me the hormone monsters were clearly just anthropomorphized hormones/puberty/emotions, not a separate entity from the kids. The "rules" of the big mouth universe make complete sense when viewed this way rather than trying to force them in as a separate entity. Sure, the one kid made a meta joke once "there's a monster standing next to you" but everything else matches this explanation. Sometimes your hormones are visible, like for example if you have a fit of rage and bust a hole in a wall, sometimes they're internal and completely invisible when you're trying to hide them, sometimes you can't hide them no matter how hard you try. Puberty hormones make you do all sorts of nonsensical and regrettable things, and make you view the world in sometimes very dramatic and unrealistic ways. It actually makes for a very apt personification, it's that feeling of your hormones acting up and controlling you and feeling like it isn't really you, but actually it is, but it doesn't always feel like it, and sometimes you can control it and sometimes you can't, etc. Hell even the monsters sometimes being shared between the kids and sometimes not starts to make sense when viewed this way, many aspects and feelings of puberty feel the same between people and many don't and are unique.
This show is ugly and disgusting. It's a typical adult cartoon on a streaming service. The jokes consist of gross, sex, and being loud. It's awful
Your accent is making me really uncomfortable lol where the heck are you from what is this? Genuine no offence I'm sure its just me but my brain keeps thinking you're American and then it goes wonky but in a way that doesn't immediately sound Canadian or anything its like uncanny valley for a voice ahhhh
Tbh, at this point I don‘t know how much I can respect big mouth  I once ADORED this show  It was my comfort show  I absolutely LOVED it  Not my favourite, but when I felt bad, I watched it.   But I was 13-15.  Now where I‘m 17 and start to realize some things, certain scenes like Maury fucking a cut off head in front of a 12 Year old kid who just wanted to kiss his girlfriend is really problematic and the show knows that.   Maury said „you know, Netflix insisted on this scene. Do you think it was to much?“ and in the last episode, he brought that up again. They know that this scene is… well. A lot. Especially because mostly young adults and teens will watch this show. I‘d really like to think that Netflix insisted on this joke, because this would make it less horrifying. But there are plenty of scenes that are pretty problematic in the context of 11-12 year olds being the main characters.   I don‘t care about them talking about puberty and sex and Big Mouth brings up some really important subjects and also handles them very well. One of the reasons why I loved/love this show so much. But sometimes it just gets a little bit to much.   I don’t know if I‘m just being sensitive… South Park brought up more disturbing scenes in the context of frcking 10 year olds being the main characters. But it feels like Big Mouth takes it more seriously. Thats why people feel uncomfortable watching big mouth and feel amused watching South Park   This show is weird. And I would have taken another season of ,Dead End: Paranormal Park“ before another Season of Big mouth… But   Oh my gosh I talk to much I LOVE THIS SHOW AHAHAHAHAHHA
I honestly thought those wacky thing, like the monsters, only happened in their mind.
I remember enjoying the first few seasons. I would watch it with my friend when we were super baked. We were like 18-19. It was hilarious. But I’m not sure I’d like it now. Tastes change. Not everything is gonna be for everyone
Big Maurth
I honestly wished that Connie stayed Nick’s horomone monster
I never laugh watching this show. I never even smirk.
I hate this thumbnail so much.
2:30 Its perfectly fine to criticize a show, any show, and anyone can agree with that from an objective standpoint. Especially when its a show as objectively trashy and hard to sit through as Big Mouth. But what is not okay is to criticize something POORLY and use logical fallacies or incorrect arguments to critique it. For instance, most peoples critique of the Fiction Bible, BERSERK, (otherwise known as the most powerful and best work of art to ever grace the human species) usually comes from a place of purposeful ignorance, lack of understanding, or other forms of true voluntary incompetence in the highest regard. What I'm saying is, most people who dislike BERSERK are Stupid, or Chronically Online(AKA Stupid) Politically Motivated(AKA Stupid) or all of the above x10.  That being said, there are some genuine critiques of BERSERK, they just USUALLY aren't spoken of outside the fandom. See where I'm going here? A lot of people who critique shows like this, usually don't watch more than one episode before proudly proclaiming they can give an honest review, same thing with BERSERK. The folk who don't like it didn't actually read it because they know it as "The rape manga" or some other genuinely black-hearted slander.  Nobody is telling you that you cannot like something that is bad, plenty of people like Steven Universe and that show is propaganda trash to indoctrinate children into lesbian pedophilia (Hyperbole, but it really is pretty bad.) But when you say you don't like something genuinely good, even praised by MILLIONS of people as being the best fiction on earth, something objectively good, you usually find it hard to have a good reason to dislike it, that is for a good reason, its cause you are wrong you just can't admit it. You may dislike something about BERSERK, but chances are you didn't give it the time of day to actually see the parts you'd like, or you just don't like the genre as a whole and that in and of itself is a bad and close minded reason. It is perfectly okay though, and its also perfectly okay to hate something that is bad, like SU, like Big Mouth.  The biggest and most important thing is to just be honest, and preface that when you say you dislike something, its for illogical, bad, or personal reasons, and not anything reasonable.
Man the intro song lives rent free in my head
7:18 "haaiieughll"
I always loved watching big mouth, i started watching in 9th grade. Also sadly taught me some stuff about Sex ed that school never bothered to. Human resources is EVEN BETTER I cried so much it was weird.
Wait, is Nathan Fillion the "random actor" Missy switches  bodies with? Goddamn it is 😂
The problem with Bigmouth is that the character design/art direction is so ugly that it's borderline unwatchable from the start.
Yes Netflix is really bad keep cancel  good show :/ one punch man family guy and ye…. Hangcock show leave :/.     Big mouth well some made u feel gross but some funny but l like homo monster guy l not fan female one but male l find funny 😆    Is odd how parents big mouth never said it.    And well shame we don t see other  monster :/  Jay name the last cum bender    😂😂😂😂😂   Funny thing is. I hate how is annoying  some characters are
wildly acclaimed, ye iit is wild; animation style is degenerate
A bit unrelated but, I really need a shit 😣😭
I also didn't hate big mouth 😂 but when you think about it as compared to other shows that people care about that got canceled 😅 you gotta ask if it deserves its place.  I think if the creators had observed your criticisms (as in during creation) it would. But as things stand,  perhaps not.
I enjoyed it until they started forcing in the crt
Pronounce "Mouth", like that again, and I promise you I'm necking it.
I can see why people don't like Big Mouth, it might be the same reason they say loli is horrible, but those same people are ok with shota. Honestly if someone is agents loli they should also be agents shota.  So many of them are pretty hypocritical. Also the plot is pretty bad, the story is mid at best, and Netflix does have a history of movies like Blue is the Warmest color, Cuties and other movies that exploit children. So there might be a good reason to not like Big Mouth. Also don't forget one of the students is revealed to be way older then he is and then marries one of the middle school girls. Big Mouth has some good ideas but fails at a lot of them. Actually Jess dad suggesting going outside and exorcise is one thing that therapist always suggest doing to help with depression. Believe it or not it does help with depression. When it comes to voice acting, no one actually see's the voice actor. They are just voicing a character so honestly, the voice actor's race really means nothing.
Honestly speaking, I as a 17 year old (15 when I started watching) I learned alot from the show. That abortion episode taught me more than I learn at school on the topic. Alot of the situations that take place in the show are SUPER relatable. The characters think almost exactly like I think internally sometimes. Like when they get anxious when talking to a girl or something small like that. In the latest season (7) it LITERALLY called out a situation I had like a year ago with a girl. So yeah. Big mouth is REALLY helpful for teens in my opinion. I'm not gonna let my kids watch though😂
19:33 Good job captions. Yes, it is just like church.
Speaking as someone who has no interest in Big Mouth whatsoever, when I hear people say "why did other, more deserving shows get cancelled when Big Mouth is still running?" What I hear is "I do not understand how other humans' minds work." I think a lot of people who say this are children, or people with the minds of children, who just assume that the things they like are objectively the best, as if the people who like other things must know that those things aren't as good and just... pretend to like them? And even more than that, executives who make programming decisions often haven't seen any of the shows they're making decisions about. They looking at ratings and viewership. A show that tons of people are watching, especially one that is critically-acclaimed and praised by its audiences, is going to stay on.  Even supposing the executives actually did feel the same way, that they agreed that Big Mouth was not as good as other shows, they can't ignore that more people watch and like it. If you're running a restaurant, and more people order the burger than the Wagyu steak, and you need to make budget cuts, you're not going to say "Well, we're discontinuing the burgers because Wagyu is superior," you're going to keep the thing that people are consuming. It's the same with shows. Executives don't say "I'm the big company boss, and I like this show because I'm stupid, so we're going to keep running it forever!" They make the popular choice. If you don't like that, your beef is with capitalism, not with people who don't "realize" your taste in shows is "objectively correct."  To be clear, this is not saying that public opinion is any measure of quality. A lot of low-effort garbage is beloved by the masses, but in a system like we have, viewership makes money, and profits are pretty much the only thing corporate decision-makers care about. At the same time, sometimes beloved, well-made media just isn't enjoyable for some people. It can be incredibly frustrating when things that you enjoy get cancelled in favor of things you find tiresome and dull, but it's not out of spite or to push some agenda. It's math. And not even complicated math. It's "big number is bigger than small number."
It's not even the mouths - the animation is just hideous  in all facets. Combined with the typically obnoxious and childishly crude style of US lowbrow comedy, it's just totally intolerable for me to watch. I can't believe this garbage keels getting renewals while SO many promising shows on Netflix were unceremoniously jettisoned after only a single season... they barely give their shows a chance!
See here’s why you can’t find this enjoyable, and this is factual  You went into this show LOOKING for the reasons to hate it. You didn’t want to enjoy this show as a show, you wanted to hate it right off the jump. You saw the hate comments about it and wanted to get on board with them, so you watched it looking for all the reasons to not like it.  Maybe if you had watched with the mindset of it’s an adult humor cartoon and nothing will be perfect, you would’ve enjoyed it more- but no, you looked for the bad and over analyzed to get to more of the bad.  I personally really enjoy Big Mouth, it’s funny, characters are driven well, the stories are relatable, it’s good. Sure some scenes are awkward- like I never could relate to any of the female characters puberty stuff, but i don’t mind that, cause I’m a guy and I’ll never understand how girls do puberty- but I can relate to a lot of the male characters.  I enjoyed it because I thought “I’ll check it out and see if it’s any good” and it was! I used to think the style looked weird but it grew on me, and I don’t focus strictly on the style, I focus on the story it’s telling and the characters we were introduced to; something clearly reviewers don’t do.
It is Massively Painful to watch. I cant relate well to the Growing up messages, because my childhood was Entirely different. And the situations in the show are so cringe it physically gives me a headache. That being said I'm a masochist so i watch a couple seasons. Don't take that as proof that I like the show Ive watched the Entirety of "Troy: The Resurrection of Aeneas" which is the worst show Ive ever seen, its so much worse than the Amazing Bulk its not even funny and is more low effort.   Anyway TLDR; Cant relate to the show, only good to watch if you like cringing your eyes out. Not the worst show Ive ever seen tho. thats just my opinion
6:40 Instantly though of Uncle Grandpa
Bigmouth used to be great, but now it sucks. Because they are pushing more of a PC and political agenda then telling stories about the woes of growing up and puberty.  And I can tell you the exact moment bigmouth started its nosedive. When they changed the voice of Missy. Jenny Slate WAS the voice of Missy and it 100X better voice actress than the noname Ayo Edebiri. And the reason behind the change is the crux of the issue and proves my point. Why did they change the voice of Missy? "To be more authentic" and by that, they meant the race of the character and whos doing the voice acting.  MISSY IS HALF WHITE AND HALF BLACK. Jenny Slate, white. Ayo Edebiri, black. She is just as authentic/unauthentic as she was before. Ya, I'm salty. Because of racial politics, they took away a voice actors job as a main character.
para mi esta chida pero algonas partes son inesesaria pero la intro esta chida
what the hell is a maith
I’m sorry, please do not call me the “target audience” for this, you really make every excuse to defend this, like pretending it helps anyone or pretending that it doing abhorrent shit is a good thing, or that it literally just being child porn is good, this will help no one, this is relatable to no one, the real target audience is pedos, I would think at least, I know one who loves this type of humour, but I digress, stop defending this show😭
"Big marth"😂❤
Why do you say “mouth” like that? Stop saying “mouth” that way. 😕
I honestly liked it, but I agree with the fact that it's more about how many good cartoons are cancelled for ones like these instead.
yes
big maourwth no hate i just- im cracking up man
yes. there i save you a video
big mouth is wierd af  but ngl its a guilty pleasure to watch
the word mouth isn't hard to pronounce bro
When I first watched big mouth in 6th grade I thought it was revolting, but when I started going through puberty I decided to man up and watch the show. I'm glad I watched it because it made me understand what was happening to my body without scaring me into thinking I'm disgusting and being afraid to talk about sex. Big Mouth made me comfortable and confident with my body, and made me relate to the characters with their funny yet weird situations. Now I'm in 9th grade (just like the characters at the time of writing this) and I learned that everybody is going through stuff, everyone has their own monsters and no one is alone. Even though I like the show I'm still upset that Netflix cancelled other shows with great potential just to end up keeping this one. (Also mb if this was hard to read, I suck at explaining things.)
the constant censoring of anything with "sex" in it takes me so out of it. It's really bad
I love how you say "gay"
Jehhh = Jay for anybody wondering
For me, big mouth has only 2 reasons why i can't like it at all 1. the artstyle is overused. It's not just the family guy and 50 shows like that, it's also increadably ugly. 2. looking at a few jokes there, it looks like it has "american dad" puberty vomit cvm kind of humour. And this is definitly not what I like, if anything it's more gross to me.  it's the combination of both tbh, Overysed + bad style, and the topic.  for that reason i liked family guy much more than the american dad. They didn't have an episode about pvbes and a character named sneeze[atl in russian version it was his name]. Though to be honest at some peoint this visual cheapness and the trash level of humour gets too much. I've gotten tired of it, just liek a lot of people in the comments.
Does everyone forget how popular big mouth is? The profit netflix is getting from it is way more the other shows
I don't know if it's bad, but it's ugly and it makes me uncomfortable.
I just found it gross. The art style, the jokes are incredibly unfunny and just made say “really? Ew.” I get it’s about puberty but it failed horribly in execution.
I liked big mouth back in middle school, I think it really does have some good parts that can make puberty easier to go through. Once you get to the humor though... You can tell its intended for an immature 12 year old lol (exactly why I enjoyed it)
The Netflix thing is just a joke. It's meant to not take seriously. It may but be funny to everyone but it's not a sincere advertisement.
The biggest issue is that its litreally child porn
I honestly love big mouth, it really helped me when I was going through puberty. It made me feel like I wasn’t alone and that all the things I was feeling were normal and ok. It’s pretty relatable, except for the middle schoolers making out😂
Fector
how did this thing get so many seasons but Dead End Season 3 was cancelled?! WHY!!!!!
i was in sixth grade when this show started and honestly it made me feel better about what i was going through and i am a die hard fan lol so im glad it got so many seasons
Short answer yes
honestly watching the show i think some hormone monsters represent the difference of puberty for everyone   andrew had a hyper sexual, brash, and DISGUSTING hormone monster because andrew has no sexual self control   missy, who spends her entire life being babied, protected, and sheltered has a sultry and seductive hormone monster representing the feelings she didnt know she had and was holding back  nick’s first hormone monster is connie, a female hormone monster, representing he is a late bloomer and different from his peers. even when he gets a different hormone monster its still an “odd one”; rick who, despite hormone monsters being millions of years old, appears to be older and disabled. still representing that nick is DIFFERENT. (as well as having a BRAND NEW hormone monster as in just got certified)  jessie, who comes from a broken home has connie. connie is both motherly while also being brash and a bit immature and not ready to settle down herself.   elijah, the first asexual character, had two hormone monsters who work together because he is different from his peers as well.   even in the last season megan thee hormone monster puts her sexuality above her feelings because thats what her client prioritizes.   all hormone monsters are the same while also being extremely different. the later seasons drop the horrific pornographic humor and is so much better.
I have no idea what Mark's accent is, but I love it. Also the way he says gay is so aesthetic. "Gae"
The show was good at first then it went woke
yes
I actually liked this series 😭
As a woman in her 30s, who grew up in a conservative household, I would have killed for Big Mouth to have been available when I was younger. I would have felt less alone/disgusted with myself for always feeling that I was broken for feeling horny, when I was taught that only men had sexual urges. I know the show is crass at times but for every crass joke there are ten poignant moments on the topics they cover. Plus I love the metaphors Big Mouth and Human Resources use to explain complex topics- need demons, anxiety mosquitos, depression kitties, lovebugs/hate worms.  This show has mad me smile and feel grace towards my younger self who really needed a Connie or a Mona to protect me, and I’ve cried over both of these shows more times than I thought I would (thanks, Keith from Grief).  I feel a lot of the people who give this show shit, either haven’t watched or are just too closed minded for an adult cartoon whose aim is to discuss human sexuality, puberty, and life lessons in a way thats both surreal and incredibly relatable.    Puberty is messy, feelings are messy, humans are messy. And it’s nice to have a show that looks at it unflinchingly without being clinical or preachy.  I know ppl are mad at Netflix for canceling shows- tbf they canceled Human Resources which sucks because it was ordered for 4 seasons and only was allowed two perfect seasons; big mouth was supposed to have 9 seasons to cover the kids through HS but Netflix reduced the order to 8 so they can go out how they want to.   But that doesn’t mean we have to tear down a good show that has preformed well, because Netflix sucks and barely advertises its shows now compared to how they used to. Back in 2017, there were non-stop ads for BM and Disenchantment months ahead of the releases. Now you’re lucky if you catch the trailer announcement two weeks before the season drops.  Something changed with Netflix post-2020, because there is a shift in how they advertised their animated shows compared to how they used to until 2019
3:27 this shot is the whole reason the app didnt blew up
Im Not gonna lie im a 13 year old Kid in puberty and i love it..
Man, I love Big Mouth. Sure it had its lows, but writing this just after watching Season 7, it definitely still has a lot of ups. In fact, I thing S07 might be one of the best.   But I guess thats super subjective, so I'll just appriciate that we'll get one more season.
I'm sorry I like big mouth :(((
2:20 THEY ARE FINALLY CALLED OUT IN THE MEANEST WAY POSSIBLE TY
People need to stop gate keeping hummor and content have the popular stuff out here in the usa is trash
Big mouth is funny af bruh
TLDR; Yes.
Jew makes show thats basically animated child porn  Par for the course
25:32 that episode isn't about abortions though? It's literally about everything Planned Parenthood does.
Why is it more disturbing for this guy to see vaginas? They show the boys penises. I thought it was to normalize vagina like how dick is considered funny. Either way I was uncomfortable with both but I’m just pointing it out
This video should be one second long and it should just say no.
Dead End and Dogs in Space Got two and Wings of Fire got Cancelled. Wings of Fire Got me So Excited.
This is so disgusting and the fact they r middle schoolers doing all that crazy stuff 😳
Trust me I am the wildest dude every watched rape porn at 14 and ate my cum but this is by far the wildest show I have ever watched about 13 years old  this show is crazy 😂
Big mouth is essentially soft core cheese pizza, a disgusting one at that, basically every episode I saw (I watched season 1-4, and rewatched the whole show when Season 4 came out) I thought the fbi was gonna raid my home for just seeing scenes of it
I actually really enjoyed this show and every season, I think they touch on some heavy parts of puberty, and of course; it’s hollywood animation lol
Yu yo mark you forget to censor the pillow pussy at 5:04
Can FActor help me when the wife can't cook? Would you know?
Do you just not like slice of life comedy?
btw, in the German dub they actually sound like kids
I won't scale the mountains and proclaim Big Mouth to be the greatest show of all time- it isn't. It's gross, a little too fart sniffingly self indulgent and the entire premise of the show has very unclear rules and storytelling vehicles... But it has some really potent moments and it tells stories that a lot of other shows wouldn't touch with a 10 foot pole. It can be surprisingly endearing with its messages  I didn't start until season 3. I remember seeing the ads and going "oh so it's family guy, but with an even worse art style and it's about kids being gross... No thanks". Took a friend to get me to sit down and give it a chance and I'm glad i did  Even still, as somewhat of a fan of the show, it irks me to no end to watch Big Mouth get endless seasons and even spinoff shows while REALLY GOOD TV, such as Inside Job and the Dark Crystal tv show get cancelled after only one or two seasons
Big mouth is disgusting, stupid and looks hideous. Which are all the reasons its my guilty pleasure show. Plus it has actually helped me to some degree with depression/anxiety/sexual identity
yeah go fuck yourself its the 2nd best show on netflix
Because the internet is filled with zoomers that can't yet relate with the show.
Earlier seasons were definitely good  Newer season are okay
38:03 we cant just skip over this mark
I like it...cause ironically its an adaptation of my childhood
You lost the plot, this show is hilarious full stop
In season 7 it’s revealed that Maury is also Calebs hormone monster so that’s why he can see him
Big mouth is a way underrated show
Honestly? Some things later in the series answer our questions. For example; in one episode, Nick was famous, the world was ending, and Andrew's kid had a hormone monster, but, Andrew never talked about it while he was an adult? I think its that they are mind wiped. And for the whole seeing them things, I think they can choose when they're seen? It would make sense, but, it's a cartoon. Nothing is going to be perfect, or sensible. But, I will agree, there are some plot holes that need to be fixed. I think you should make a new video on this topic, with knowledge of Human Resources. There are at least 10 reasons for the "Monsters". So, yeah! Let's just... think a bit more? Regardless, it's a really fun cartoon to enjoy, mostly for KIDS who are going through it. I love all of it! Yes, some episodes bore me, but that's because I've watched it over 5 times. Bottom line, we need to wait until it's fully done until we can understand all of it.  😃
The pillow stuff was the worst ngl.
I remember watching the first two seasons and thinking it was ok. But third season was unwatchable. They feel so smug and stupid It just hits weird and feels wrong. Idk i just couldn’t get into the gross out stuff and it felt like they kept doing the same thing every episode.
A milenal acusing the show of not understanding things that no one wants from big mouth, while totally missing the obvious purposefulness of its lack and excess self awareness
The show is hilarious. I can see it not being everyone’s cup of tea but you seem to be criticizing it for what it’s not instead of what it’s actually intended to be. You’ll never really see why ppl love it that way
I'm just here to point out that it may be worth self-examining how much more grossed out you act about female ge*italia being shown then the male ones lol. You mentioned about 2 times in the entire video how you do not like anybody's private parts being pictured but then you commented in much more disturbed manner and multiple more times about Jessie soecifically, that the scenes are way over animated or way over gross. In the meantime there are far grosser scenes included with Jay and multiple other characters get weird close up animated scenes auch as Andrew with the Joker parody situation which is far more ridiculous and it doesnt have any educational value. I think that speaks to why both genders had to he included if such scenes were drawn at all. They literally made an entire episode in the last season about why they are showing awkward situations including girls and you completely ommited it. I would kinda get why one would otherwise since the last season is exceptionally boring, but taking the rest of the video in the account makes it look funny. Girls are human too and they too have puberty related issues that can be gross too and that is normal and not something that should be any more taboo than male stuff. If there is one thing this show manages to do well is to show they understand that.
no
7:42 "There's a monster next to you." :D
I’m still pissed that dead end is canceled . I love that show a lot and I just… ugh…
Krolls dad is one of the most powerful people in America that's why its still on, blackmail. It's not terrible but watching it creeps me out.
It’s so funny how every time he enjoys the show he doesn’t admit it 💀 He’s like “this part might almost be slightly alright” because he wants to relate to the wider youtube audience 😭
this is what I think is created buzz. the streaming services thrust things at you they want you to watch " based on your taste".  adding to this new to streaming service users ( like grandma or your uncle ) are not good at navigating menus, so they just go to the thing they're told to. ╮⁠(⁠.⁠ ⁠❛⁠ ⁠ᴗ⁠ ⁠❛⁠.⁠)⁠╭ personally i think big mouth is very unfunny. and a bit offensive. the ugly art is implied, its for adults of  course.
31:46 yeah it's good because South Park did it
Big mouth just isn't my type of television. Tho to be fair I don't watch a ton of TV as is.
I think like many other shows that big mouth ended up getting better in the later seasons, and it is very sad that Netflix keeps canceling good shows but still any shows should still have a chance at least for 2 to 3 seasons, I would think
Fuck big mouth. I want Inside Job back, NOW. Time to cancel my Netflix subscription.
They mention a few times that other people cant see morry
I can't believe Mark skipped through the Christmas special and missed the most disturbing scene in the entire show that is the elf orgy
''How does that happen?''  Jewish Nepotism
I didnt even know nick was the main character
I always saw this show as... inappropriately fucked up.   These are meant to be kids. AKA Minors. Yet we see them making out, humping, jerking off and talking to their privates. How is this not considered CP? It's so gross.
anybody know the name of the song he used for the intro to season 4
Big Mouth is like Teen Titans Go. It was okay the first few episodes, and the first season should have been the end. But now we're stuck with this....really, really......pedo-vibey show that gives even the deviants the ick.
14:25 HEY THATS TUTTLE FROM AMERICAN DAD
I stumbled upon this show when i was like 9 and now as a teenager i see how real the show is , and surprisingly i have grown to like the artstyle and have liked alot of the dumb and gross humor but this show did NOT need as many seasons as it got😮‍💨
To be fair, I bought a phasmaphobia style laser pointer off amazon and I feel a lot less depressed now
Ok here’s my opinion, is Big Mouth a good show. Oh no absolutely not. BUT I am okay with it’s existence because it’s a show that shows kids/young teens that puberty is normal and the emotions they have is okay which I don’t think is prominent enough in media nowadays.
Maybe the real Big is the Mouths we made along the way
Omg that ally character made me so mad just because its horrible queer representation! It sucks to see a new queer character introduced only for them to be extremely obnoxious😢
Geh
Big mouth came out when I was in middle school, so the show was relatable which appealed to. Big mouths charm is SUPPOSED to be uncomfortable, because its abut puberty and growing up. This show has also helped me with not feeling alone in my situation, for instance, Tito the anxiety mosquito. I was able to recognize what anxiety was so I could cope with my symptoms as I'm also autistic. This one of my most favorite shows!
Big Mouth isnt...bad...but its boring.
Not gonna lie the worst part of this show for me is the fucking art style, I swear it’s like they named the show after the massive fucking mouths instead of having the mouths be so large thanks to the show’s name.
I think that's actually not true of Family Guy. I think their first and second season are their strongest. Don't get me wrong I actually enjoy them all even the newest. I get where you're coming from though I think southpark's best seasons are like 6-10ish but
The one cringy emo kid made a show
Big mouth is like that one kid who gets the most candy on Halloween for no reason.
"Big Marth"
Imma be honest i feel like i like big month so much cause alot of the stuff that happen ive either seen or experienced. Puberty and growning up didnt happen slow i just went threw the motion and stuff just happen
Imma be honest i feel like i like big month so much cause alot of the stuff that happen ive either seen or experienced. Puberty and growning up didnt happen slow i just went threw the motion and stuff just happen
this aged like shit
This show sucks because it is weird as fuck and watching it is weird as fuck
25:29 yeah, its a feeling and not a hallucinogen, the effects vary from person to person and strand to strand, ive personally never tried it, but my mom and brother smoke and they have different reactions to them, my brother gets more chill, but my mom gets more active, wanting to do more, same thing with other family members.
Im glad that big mouth exists, it gives a good sense of scale on how bad a show can be and still be a long running show, and by long running, i mean a show that didnt deserve more seasons.
I really liked the first couple of seasons. I fell off after that, but it felt like it had a lot of heart under to crass and gross humor.
Yes. Yes it is.
This show is amazing good references plot twist funny dirty racist dumb organic repairable comedy and nick correlate really captured all of us when we was in middle school like we all went through everything except for Mathew  ain't nobody went through that facts  it showed us about puberty anxiety sexuality graduating girlfriends /boy friends if you can't understand that ion what you was watching damn the graphics like I think it was really good but I don't eat you mean that big mmohth is bad and you stoped at the 4 episode like all the actresses that's in here and you missed out on a lot I mean a lot
🥭
im just glad there arent any actual kids involved with this show *coughcoughcutiescoughcough*
TL;DR: Yes.
Ugliest show I've ever seen
What is the song during the transitions when he counts up, with the dancing dog
Big Marth
I just remember this being a hit with my peers back in junior high
''big moirth''
Yes
I’m only ten minutes in and I’m wheezing at the comparison between Nick and Andrew’s voice’s because Andrew’s voice actor / comedian John Mulaney isn’t even voice acting. That is his actual voice and he makes fun of his childish aspects in his standup routine. We can only hope this makes it to him so he can talk about it in his next special
I appreciated the way they tried (emphasis on tried) to show what it’s like growing up with depression and anxiety. Tito the anxiety mosquitoe and the depression kitty seemed to tackle it well but they flopped big time on how to “get rid” of or deal with the two. Being thankful doesn’t get rid of two big mental illnesses, neither does riding a bike, or whatever else they tried. I had hoped they’d show what might happen is Jessie took anti-depressants and the stigma you could face for taking them, the stigma for going to a therapist or needing help. Her arch made me feel less alone but I definitely wish there had been more there.
i love big mouth its so fun
This is such a comfort video for me and I don't know why. Mark shit talking a shitty show is my favorite genre of youtube video.
I feel very uncomfortable watching some of those clips to be honest.
16:21 "andrew wondering if he might be _gæhh_ "
God i never noticed how much of an eyesore big mouth is until you played a scene and then it cut to your character and my eyes were way more happy looking at the screen
23:36 okay that’s actually funny because of how fucking stupid it is
you don't understand who jules kroll is and how he and his disturbed son operate.
It’s ending in 2024
Big mouth is overall just so bad if you're gonna make a series make it off of a good topic like lackadaisy what type of show is made off of a topic where you're hitting puberty and a fucking hormone monster follows you when you reach a certain point of puberty like what the fuck is that
I don't understand how big mouth wasn't cancelled before it even aired
Mark, I have to ask. I enjoyed the video except for one particular criticism about the kids sounding like adults and I just want to confirm. Are you saying that you would rather have children/people who sound like children talking about these extremely sexual and personal situations? Because uhh, that's a little weird man
3:28 it looks so gross.
Yes.
This show is only surviving because Nick Croll is the son of a billionaire family
Here’s my take, do I like the show? Yes.i personally find the show hilarious and honestly told some good stories. Some characters are relatable to a degree and are somewhat easy to connect too. It shows many different version of how people grew up. A lot of us were alone during those times and as an adult we see these things and connect it mentally and see that we weren’t actually alone. I honestly quote this show about once a week lol.   On the other hand….the show declines in quality pretty fast 2/3s of the way through season 4. I can also see why people are turned off by tue show due to its very crude humour and animation. But, I wish people would see the positives of the show   Will I watch the last two seasons? Yes? Do I think I will enjoy it? Idk.
Short answer: yep.
It makes me uncomfortable seeing such young children in extremely sexual situations and dropped it after some of season 2 despite my friends liking season 1
I saw someone with a Coach Steve Tattoo.. They should prob work on their decision making skills.
i have a love hate relationship with this show it makes me want to scream over how awful it is but i really like the way they flesh out some of the characters like Missy i really like how they developed her character
Yes, is it bad
critics like it bc they are p3d*s clearly
Yes
Just dont look at horny's nose... its awful
hey man, if it's entertaining, it's entertaining
I feel like Big Mouth having a lot of popular actors, like Nick Kroll, make it more popular too. I enjoyed the first two seasons the most because I felt it did a good job showing off the struggles some people have growing up without sex ed or just discovering themselves. It ended up getting just ridiculous or raunchy for the sake of it mid 3 but I felt I got what I wanted out of it by then. Their spin off, Human Resources, was a great watch for Season 1.
Netflix has a habit of canceling good shows and remaining bad. Even if the animation was low in relation to the image per second, its premise, the design proposal, shone! Now Inside Job is canceled out of nowhere, just like they did with Final Space, it's surreal that they didn't even give an episode to say goodbye. The biggest example of a cartoon that got canceled all the time, and every season finale was a different send-off, would be Futurama. Notice that every season finale (I think after the fourth season) was the final episode of the show.
I actually liked this show
Big mouth is a show I really enjoyed... Especially in the first few seasons... I think my opinion started going down a little bit when the season with summer camp was released. However... I did and will continue to follow the show... because at this point... I really just want to know how they're going to end the series. Unless something has changed... season 8 will be the final season.  I have some things to say about human resources... So I'll be heading there next.   Honestly... I really enjoy watching your videos and hearing your opinions... hopefully you don't get sick of me and my comments... Warning! I am currently binge watching your content... so it's likely you will see a full out of me in your comment sections😊
"Is Big Mouth really that bad?" The short answer is yes. The long answer is also yes.
Im sorry. But that is the scariest thumbnail I have ever seen
I love big mouth!! I always throw it on my tv😂
My rhought of this show is just its for rich pedophiles who support this show
I realy Like it for me it is so Fun tagt i Even didn‘t know that the Serie is hated by many people
Why do you pronounce words like that? 😢 Big Marth?
yeah idk if i can reasonably think a show that has children and nudity as a main plot like as a good show
27:16 in my opinion I kind of took that like since it’s her hormone monster distracting the depression“cat” I saw that like how people would distract themselves by their depression and it would “go away” for a little bit because in other episodes the depression cat “comes back”. or I could be wrong or maybe they conveyed it very poorly either way.   🤷 I have no idea.
I Fucking love this show
Big moith
iLike Big Mouth
I love this show
I gotta say I loved it when it first came out, it wasn't my favorite show but I thought it was crude and funny (which is right up my alley) Some seasons are much worse than others, I personally really like the most recent season.  The cancelled show that pisses me off most is Inside Job. It's humor is "Rick and Mortyish" at times, but as a huge fan of that show I thought it was amazing. It has so much more potential and the season two ending left soooo many questions unanswered
The only Big Mouth episode I laughed at was one were they were talking about "The Rock of Gibraltar".
Big Mouth is just softcore child porn but nobody wants to admit to it.
35:38 HOLY SHITUTUTUTIT8T8TT8T5 IT DAT A UNDERTABLE REFRENC????
Let's just replace everything with big mouth
I don’t like this show, but I haven’t had any issue parsing out the surrealism of the storytelling. It’s not that confusing at all
Every time you mention Velma I throw up in my mouth
it was funny for a few episodes then the rest of the time spent watching it was trying to find the funny in it
Ehhhhhh idk about this one 😂 it’s a good show. Choppy at times and they do rush a lot of stuff, but ive NEVER seen half this crap in a show before let alone an animated one. It’s actually telling the truth as to what it’s like for a lot of people. I know for a fact my male friends have fucked their pillows as kids. And they all said when they found out how babies are made they thought their pillows would become pregnant. So yeah, I guess you could say it’s “child humour” but it’s the jokes we couldn’t make back then, because then you’d have to admit you fucked your pillow, or came in the same room as your dead grandpa, or hid in a closet accidentally seeing two older people do smexual things.  I personally love the show. I will say season 6 is starting to show the downfall finally, but that’s one season so far. Maybe they can’t turn it around, maybe they’ll never be canceled even if the show turns to totally bullshit, but comparing it to other canceled shows won’t make it less popular. It’s like Justin Bieber in the 2000s 🤣
Yes. It's fuckin weird to animate naked kids. There is literally a way easier way to talk about puberty than more or less drawing kiddy porn.
I honestly think a lot of this aspects of the show went over your head, they don’t sound like kids but it’s part of the joke, like how women in bobs burgers are voiced by men, and the hormone monsters are like a personification of how they feel, it’s showing what goes on inside your head *Andrew is mad at Nick and wants to fight* his hormone(monster)s tell him to get enraged and fight, Maury is a visual representation of Andrews hormones, so he’s a H0rny kid so he’s given an active hormone monster because his hormones tell him often to please himself, just like Nick gets horrible monsters because it represents him being a late bloomer and not being as sexually mature as his friends, and Jay has NO hormone monster because he already knows how to please himself sexually and doesn’t need guidance on it
My only defense for watching this show was the fact that I was the same age as the characters when it began and I had similar situations or problems as the characters. I do agree that its a bit weird if a grown ass adult person watches it lol
The way he says big mouth actually makes me angry
Im nkt about to trust the opinions of a guy who cant even be bothered to say the name of the fucking show correctly
Yes
I kinda love this show
As a teenage girl, I really like and appreciate big mouth. like it’s really stupid and nasty but It's honestly really relatable. I like how blunt and honest it is about puberty and all aspects of it from different point of views. like for once we don’t just get “oh were getting body hair🤯“ or “we’re getting our periods” we get all of the emotional aspects to, like We get Missy struggling with her biracial identity and we get Jesse coming to terms with her broken family (two things that I personally understood) . and to touch on the thing that Mark said about them being too grown-up and not acting/talking like children, I actually think that they do because I know personally a lot of kids my age act and talk like this. We’re all pretty mature, while still being immature considering we’re still growing up. so yes Big Mouth is bad and stupid most times, but I think overall it’s a good show.
I heard the premise of this show, and remembered that someone on Webtoon did it WAY better. Except it isn't specifically puberty centered, there are just manifestations of emotion that aren't visible to anyone.
dose any one else think the monster kinda resembles roger from american dad?
I watched this show in highschool and remember the 1st season being pretty funny, however, I remember there being a sharp decline in season 2 that continued into season 3. Been years since I watched it this is just from what I remember.
I dont care I love Big Mouth.
i mean, a lot of people likely worked hard on big mouth, but it's not a show that seems to put a lot of attention into its plot or characters, unlike other shows that got cancelled after the second season or so :,)
ive always loved big mouth. it came out when I was 12 so being about to watch something that openly talked about the things that I was going through (or going to go through) and what others around me were experiencing taught me a lot. learnt more in the show than my parents/teachers taught me. also I weirdly love the animation style. idk why don't ask
I’m brazilian and I think the show ressonates better with latin americans in general because we live our sexualities in a very explicit way, which starts happening when we’re around 11. I have some college friends who stayed in some north-american colleges and said that they usually were pretty immature and dealing with sex like we used to do in middle school and I think that that’s relevant when we discuss a show like Big Mouth beacuse almost every person that I know that watched the show really enjoyed it and maybe our culture has someting to do with it. I already watched porn with friends in breaks during high school and even during middle school we used to have some discussions way more explicit than Big Mouth shows, I’ve literally had a friend that “had sex” with his pillow with 10 years old, so to me, the show couldn’t be more realistic in how they show puberty and sexuality in kids. Deal with it guys, kids and young teenagers know a lot about sex, have intense discussions about it and, honestly, I think this is good because it means we can learn more about our health and sexualities early, which tends to reduce the risks and negative consequences of reckless sex.
Honestly, I love Big Mouth and I really don’t ger why people think it’s bad. It really has some amazing character development, it tackles hard topics such as sexuality, gender and mental health in a very comic, light and accurate way and it represents the bad part of growing in the best way possible to me. I get some people just don’t like the humor, but I really don’t think the show is bad, it’s really well made and if you think it’s shallow or that the characthers aren’t developed, you’re really just stupid and too shocked about some scenes, which I don’t really get, but it’s probably because I’ve always talked easily about sex and I’m used to seeing some preety explicit shit in art and films in general. Overall, Big Mouth is just definitely my comfort show, I absolutely love the characters and always look forward to the next seasons.
yes it is
I watched the first season, saw pillow fucking and a baby pillow. I was out, hearing that the pillows continued felt like a dodged bullet. I also very much disliked seeing kids genitals, they are under 18. Please stop showing a kids private fucking talk for several painful minutes.  Imagine someone walking by, it’d be hell to explain.  I dislike the human’s designs, realistic eyes plus big mouths feels like that meme of someone taking an anime girl and changing it to be realistic. (Massive eyes, small mouth) The monsters however seem visually fun from this video. They fit the style and don’t fall into uncanny valley too often. I just hate the old one, and the show creator being the head guy. I wanted to see a cool design, like could still be just him. But a characteristic version.  But the thing that makes it hard to watch for me, is some of the voices are just grating to listen to. It plus ugly designed humans, weird plots, and really questionable scenes. Doesn’t help.  But the idea is neat.
hating on big mouth is crazy
Yeah this covers all forms of kink
The writing, humor, gross outs, animation and wasting many talented actors on it is why this show is hated. It's such a shame that Netflix refuses to let this show die. Instead they decide to cancel other shows that were more deserving for more seasons and or spinoffs. This show it's spinoff Human Resources are the biggest piles of crap Netflix has produced.
So who’s gonna play mk1 when it comes out?
A bunch of chomos.....
this show could be better if the character designs don't look like shit
Quick answer yes
Ahhhh, yes, Rotten Tomatoes, the TV/film equivalent to a peer-reviewed scholarly article. Also, a pro-choice narrative is perhaps extremely relative to shit in the U.S. I mean, it's not as if people don't commonly die without access to safe and legal abortion services🙄
tbh i thought big mouth peaked with the 3rd season and this show is only good when it focuses on your issues, though the highlight of the show is the guest voices, it excels at knowing who can play there character to the fullest. (besides nick as like 15 characters) Since missys voice change is when the show fell off imo, but thats also when i stopped relating to other topics they cover. i can't call this a deep dive because there's nothing to deep dive into really but this is a good video discussing a bizzare ass show
Ah yes a shiw that sexualizes children but this dipshit likes hit i swear i want marks mouth to be removed because all he says is bullshit
I and many others did talk like that where we started to care about real life issues during our tweens such as social injustice and the environment. Playing around as we used to do became less fun and we started to talk more about mature topics. We often watch the news on school and sometimes read newspapers. My pre teen brother is already interested in economy and finances for some reason as he likes to engage in serious business conversation with our parents.
It makes sense that some adults from the show don't know what the hormone monsters are since many adults in real life forgets that puberty is ever happen in their life so they just thinks childhood ends peacefully happy at age 18 where they suddenly rapidly transform into adults over night and infantilize anyone under 18 but have passed puberty as just another innocent sexless babies living in harmony who don't even know where babies come from.  Prudish Americans still talks down to them like little children while elsewhere often treats them as youths that they really are. Legal adulthood and biological adulthood are different as what's considered legally adult variates throughout time periods, society and cultures such as before WW1 where you turned into legal adult at age 21 in America but got lowered 3 years because America needed more soldiers and workers that later became the standard for most of the world where legal adulthood was previously slightly lower.  In biological sense you are adult once you are able to bare and raise children on your own which is about when you end puberty which variates from person to person. Psychological maturity variates throughout culture but the brain itself still grows very slowly after puberty until mid-20s.
This video is just hitpice on a show by someone who dosent like or relate to it, disguising it as criticism, throughout the whole video your were judging the show based on how you felt about it and your interpretation of what it was trying to say instead of what the creators were trying to say(witch is the entire point of criticism) its clear in the video that you dont like the show and you make zero effort to make an objective assement. But at the beginning of the video you call out all the hate bigmouth is getting and claim that your video is somehow diffrent.
kids these days wouldent be addicted to tech if we wernt surrounded by it im sorry i was given an ipad at 3 yrs old if you dont like it then dont give us tech when were that young
Floored at seeing 12 oz. Mouse, haven't heard that name in years!!!
i still want to know whose childhood the storyline of getting a cushion pregnant is based on
Big mouth is just pedophile fuel
we lost cuphead show because of these fuckers
It's a grooming show
Honestly don't have an opinion of this show. However i seem to recall that timing also factored into the negative opinion of this show. Netflix, if i remember that timeframe (2015 thru 2020), was getting itself into hot water because they were releasing movies and shows that were viewed as being sexually exploitive of minors. Prior to Big Mouth you had Nymphomaniac and a couple other movies that were doing the whole coming of age warts and all thing. About season 4 you had Cuties which pretty much became the smoking gun in that argument because of the ad campaign netflix had run for the film.
You're right about the underrated animation getting cancelled with open ending and no full potential. InfinityTrain deserves more storytelling and I can recommend YOU ALL the show
I rlly loved big mouth, imo the first season was the best
My main gripe is just the fact of how sexual it is while everyone in the show are minors. Yes it's a "coming of age story", but the only reason they oversexualized it isn't to be relatable, it's for shock humor. I'm not about policing content typically, so I don't think it should be banned, but I myself find it kinda unsettling, so therefore I don't watch it or support it, even though I think it can be funny occasionally. Idk, something about this show in particular feels off to me.
Not to say that there aren't tons of problems with the show, but I do feel this video doesn't quite understand it. Most of the stuff is metaphorical. That super-hero episode? It wasn't a 'what if', it was a kids interpretation of the events that actually happened. Even a lot of the rule breaking stuff, like that same kid seeing the hormone monster is just a meta joke. He's the only one that sees it (although that's of course abandoned later, too, but that is the joke, which is shown here twice as a sort of 'gotcha').  Aside from that, it's really not a coming of age story, and I think part of the problem is that the viewer here expects it to be one. It's not really about growing up, it's just about how awkward that period of life is.  As for the super ugly characters, I think there's also a good reason for that: They absolutely want the characters to look as non-sexy as possible, given the subject matter that they cover. The unappealing characters help them get away with nudity and things without it feeling pornographic.  Now, again, the show isn't great, and there are a million things wrong with it, but it does feel like a lot of the issues here are expecting the show to be something different from what it was meant to be, and treating that as a failure, and likewise kind of failing to read between the lines of the storytelling (and yes, I feel completely ridiculous implying that there's some inner depth to the ugly show with the gross sex jokes. It's not deep and complex, but it's far from a literal show).  Anyways, I think it's okay. Not great, by any stretch, but okay. It's different if nothing else.
Honestly, the finger joke would been funnier like this: "You've got five fingers, right?" "Oh, yeah, of course!" (Raises up hand, realizes there's only four. Eyes widen.) (Cuts back to wide shot showing that the monster is also shocked.) End scene.
I'd love to see this concept done better. But thanks for an honest look. Not my show. Also, a cat as depression is great.
Big mouth is truly painfully overrated
The show could be great... If it was focused on Jessie.
I’m glad more shows that are actually aimed at teens instead of adults are getting more comfortable with handling this kind of stuff, since bigmouth is just going to look worse and worse in retrospect. Honestly once actual competent writers get ahold of this concept that show is going to be everywhere
Okay so they gave a male character a female hormone monster. They could have taken that and made an intersex character.
Honestly despite all its hate i learned more bout puberty and all the things i actually needed to know about myseld i actually enjoyed the show and how it portrayed it all. Yeah the artstyle looked weird as hell and yeah some episodes and things were weird also but that didnt matter for me i honestly loved how stupid this is and it makes me happy
I can’t hate on bigmouth, it related to me personally and helped me through some though times
I dont think coming of age stories need a goal necessarilly. The heros journey shouldnt be mandatory in a story.
18:02
if only this show about sexualizing children was of higher quality
I'd like the metaphor of battling anxiety better if the tools given to him by his friends to help him battle the anxiety
i can appreciate the approach of being so blunt about puberty and sex ed and shit, but aside from just not being that funny & having a really ugly art style, i absolutely despise how much child nudity is shown. especially how fucking graphic it is. its genuinely disgusting and i dont know how someone who isnt attracted to pubescent kids would think of the shit they show. and i know people try to defend it as "educational for teens" but shows that are so graphic with their visuals and dialogue are never actually marketed to kids or teens. its gross as fuck.
I dunno, I would never say it's a masterpiece by any measure, but I like the show as background noise at least cuz the plot is usually easy to follow. Seasons 1-5, anyway. I though Human Resources was OK, but literally as soon as the baby was born I turned the show off and haven't gone back since.
I wacthes this during the pandemic bc i had nothing better to watch, And the memories still haunt me😢
I absolutely despise this show I don’t mind the art style, I adore the cast some of the funniest people around in my opinion my problem with it is the show is incredibly mean spirited and not funny
I love big mouth dunno why it gets the hate
If the cast had their own hormone monsters, there would probably have to be a lot less characters. The amount of kids and their respective monsters would be difficult to keep track of tbh. I'd say, if season 1 had four or five pubescent characters and showed who was controlling their hormones gradually, that would be a nice way to ease into it. Then down the line, new characters can be added bit by bit until the whole cast has been shown
The episode where the boys rank all the girls and vise versa is an idea from South Park. 😂
So two hormone monsters have a baby together that will probably be a character? God It really is Fairly god parents
The answer is no
Jesus 56 minutes long??? Don't get me wrong I enjoy the show sometimes but not 56 minutes worth lmfao
The Hormone Monster isn’t seen by anyone but Caleb because it’s heavily implied Caleb is autistic
🤓
i really really like bigmouth i like it ALOT
Its probably not gonna be a popular opinion but big mouth is one of the few shows where the spinoff was better, because it was just more consistent with the rules of the universe it was working with
tbh i rlly like big mouth
If you want to enjoy big mouth go into the show with 0 expectations, turn off your brain and just watch it, don’t try to make sense of the show and just go a long with the ride which is kinda how puberty works, the more you try to make sense of what’s going on the more you get confused, it’s honestly better to just go with it
Magic spoon
In my opinion Big Mouth is way too underrated. Big Mouth 11 out of 10.
I love big mouth personally
It got much worse after season 3
I liked Season 1. Season 2 got worse, but it was still good.  It just got painful, and like Family Guy, it just got offensive but unfunny, the characters got really unlikeable, it felt tired and lifeless, the characters just swapped romantic partners, and I have mention how left wing it is, which is how most of entertainment is, but it’s just so painful to see a comedy shill for planned parenthood
Eu amo essa série porque ela quebra tabus e fala coisas muito polêmicas sobre a adolescência, coisas que acontecem mas ninguém fala sobre, eu não só consigo mas me identifico e já me identifiquei com muitos personagens da série em várias VARIAS ocasiões e eu acho sim que essa série é digna de continuar na Netflix porque ela é boa o bastante, eu só espero que essa não seja a verdadeira razão de outras séries estarem sendo canceladas, tipo a culpo não pode ser inteiramente de Big Mouth porque não faz sentido.
Also no one can see the hormone monster except the person the monster belongs to because the monster is just a metaphor for hormonal emotions/libido. The thing about Caleb being able to see Maury is a joke about him being autistic, he tends to break the fourth wall
Honestly I think the show is hilarious, in my opinion you're over thinking it. It's a comedy, you can kinda just turn your brain off and laugh at it.
*Yes*
I think the reason people “loved” Big Mouth is because they don’t actually watch it. Hear me out, sometimes I get off work but feel like watching something, I’m just too tired to give it my full attention. When the show came out I was in Highschool, I never gave it the chance but the people I knew that did were also working on twelve other things. As an adult with MORE responsibilities I sometimes “watch” shows I don’t like while doing something else, like Owl House and Amphibia. Not bad shows, but not my style, still I “watch” them.
God this show both looks AND sounds hideous to me.  It's Problem Solverz tier to me. Even if the writing wasn't absolutely insufferable, this is just an assault on my senses.
I appreciate Big Mouth for what it attempted to do. My utter contempt for the show comes from just how unwatchable it was. The designs make me actively sick to look at, the characters are annoying at best, and on two separate occasions, I've tried to give it a try... and could not make it further than 10 minutes into the first episode before having to turn it off. This was a good idea, but so poorly executed!
I almost wish all of the background footage was of everything else besides the show because it's ugly as fuck. And on purpose too, which makes it worse
Dude big mouth is weird as fuck and if you were going through puberty and the show actually helped you fuck sake find some actual help cause big mouth is just weird
how the hell was this on the kids side im not joking
I enjoyed big mouth being the target ordinance as a kid I felt older and mature to understand the jokes then after season 4 it kinda for me and I emphasise that for me session 1-2 and 3 (part from the spin off what if with the superpowers) was really good and season 4 exploded new ways and ideas but season 5 felt wired and not really any good and then season 6 just seemed like beating the hours. However the spin off sucks. But overall being targeted audience and an average viewer It was good
Who is here after it was announced that big mouth is ending? I am
Short answer: Yes. Long answer: Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss.
For me problem with BM is that it started as gross yet funny depiction of puberty, but with each season it goes more and more into absurd oversimplification of pubery (like everyone have same kind of problems depicted by same HR character and life is shit stuff bcs then its easier to writer story) and whats even worst is that i can sense so much WOKNES in newer seasons thats its absolutely discusting. I dont have anything against charaters that are bi, pan, a, trans etc but racist joke about white people dubbing black character (kratos is f-ing white so does vader but black man is dubbing em but thats not racist?) Not to mention whole gender is just a concept s-t like cmon guys i study microbiology and i have a load of anatomy and genetics to know that's its not true xD
I was in middle school when it came out and big mouth made me feel less alone as I went through those awkward pre-teen and teen years. I don't connect with it much now and don't watch it anymore but it was a great thing for when I was younger.
mouth - moWTH  think meow, but remove the e and add TH to the end.
38:26 more like SQUEAKIN of which!
Plok akrillic
up until this video i thought andrew was the main character
There are many reasons why i do not like Big Mouth. There is the usual stuff you hear, the art style being ugly and the resentment of it getting more seasons while Inside Job got canceled.   But i also dont like it because the characters are pretty damn unlikable, the humor feels like its just edgy and gross for the sake of it. It becomes predictable and groan worthy.  There are two things i do really like though. One is the Horomone Monstress. She feels like she is actually trying to help and its Maya Rudolph doing the voice and thats a huge plus. The other was how they tackled amxiety in season 4.
Hopefully LSMark considers using guest narrators so I don't have to listen to his Canadian accent for so long.  It's worse than listening to people chew.
Poor dude is trying so hard to see the positives the show can do but... so many sus shots, bad meta jokes, using opprotunities to use symbolism to instesd make jokes that end up ruining the moment more often than not- it's a mess of clashing ideas that just sucks :(
((( 9:38 )))
Eu odeio muito essa porcaria dessa série.  "Big mouth" bagulho escroto esquisito. Outra coisa é que eu não entendo é, porque que esse monstro parece um demônio?
I can't get into Big Mouth, whether it is a good show or not...I can't get pass the cartoon design. I'm not saying I haven't watched cartoons that had weird or bad designs...Its just this design is just so bad in my eyes that I just can't get passed the style to see if I enjoy it or not.
Wait, people hate this show? I had no idea, I absolutely love it. Topics are relevant, jokes are funny, songs are brilliant - what's there to hate?
Lol the thumb nail 🤣🤣🤣
0:23 LSMark: what season is your most loved? Most likely not the first couple, proceeds to show to shows that peaked in the first 3 seasons
Indont really like it because it sexualizes teenagers
Im sorry are you Canadian? Your accent seems so weird
Despite my friends and I agreeing the show is bad and stupid, we still get together every time a new season drops and blow through it in a night. We laugh, but we also hate it. Great show.
YES! ITS PEDOPHILIC!
i hate big mithe
big mouth is mid
Big maeuwth
What's the name of song that you used at 53:39?
The more offensive and sexually perverted, the more they push it. It's really important that they sexualize children, because they need to groom them for all the wealthy and influential pedo's out there. They get paid well, so that cancels out the guilt.
i’m not gonna watch the video, yes it is. the show is depraved and foul, nobody above 16 should enjoy it
so we just have to accept that one of the few animated shows that didn't get cancelled is literally just cp?
While this show is incredibly weird, it’s relatable for teens in puberty
Inside job was boring tbh
I've never watched an episode and can honestly answer...yes, yes it was that bad.
I don’t think it’s worthy of the hate; I think there’s resentment because shows, like Inside Job, got cancelled way quicker
Does it really even matter if planned parenthood does only a small percent of abortions? They still kill children. It’s like saying it doesn’t matter a serial killer killed 4 people because he also saves cats.
When I was 18 I thought Big Mouth was really good and funny. Now that I'm 22, and decided to binged watch it again. I realized sucks and cringe. Idk, why and how my perspective on the show changed.
Is Nick Kroll most famous as the fat pig in sing to you?  How old are you?
25:16 not a Cartoon, but don't hotline Miami makes a good perception on How It is?
This is just the worst kinda show for a slightly paranoid conservative. Blatant indoctrination of children brazenly rubbed in your face.
I don’t hate big mouth but it definitely has a disorganized story, and also they think over disgusting things is funny like trying to copy South Parks shock value, but South Park does it for over exaggerated jokes of what they are making fun of while Big Mouth does it, just cuz, I honestly thought it became a fucking chore to get through the 6th season it actually gave me a headache making me not want to watch it anymore and just bash on it, but whatever I could give a shit less about it
It's basically a 'what if' of the last season of rick & morty but the entire cast is kids, it's crass gross and questionable.  Like the velma 'reboot' the creators should be put on watchlists for deliberately putting minors into unnecessarily ugly situations constantly.  It's insanely doubtful they have wholesome motives in mind given what they're intent on focusing on, those that deliberately aim to sabotage the innocence of kids should be blacklisted from making content for children.  That's why it's hated.   Funny how you never bring up rotten tomatoes' critics are bought off, that's why the site is mocked and hardly taken seriously.
big maurth
The show is for groomers
Fun fact that no one cares about; In Latin American spanish, Coach Steve shares his voice actor with the sniper from The Last Of Us.
Its hated because it normalizes the sexualization of minors and the constantly hyper-sexualized world they're exposed to. Its a way to get people more deadened to the idea of children having sex and jerking off to extremely degenerate pornography in their earliest years of young adulthood.  This sort of behavior should be discouraged and shamed, not normalized.
I managed to watch 12 minutes of an episode once... horrendous show
I mean watching a 12 year old screw a sentient pillow, definetly put me on a watchlist. Not continuing show
i like how you say mouth
human resources is muuuuch betterr
big month, big muith, big moith
Good video but you really gotta learn how to say mouth
Big Mouth came out my first year of college and I was instantly hooked. I’ve never been a big fan of the adult cartoon comedy genre (Futurama & Archer may be the only exception) but this has been the only one where I have watched every episode of the show. Now that Human Resources is on its second season it just adds to my love of the overall universe.
I love it, Is just a show for me to atch while I am cooking rating or doing something in the house, like to a "Casa blanca" .
No its not and you shouldn't need a 30 min think piece to form your own opinion 😂
wait nick is the main character???
On the weed topic, tbf they took edibles which effect you differently. Also they took one whole one each when typically you're only supposed to eat half. The first time I took too much edibles it did feel like I was melting into the mattress and I kept forgetting where I was. My boyfriend had to cuddle me all night because I was freaking the fuck out.
I think this show is unfunny, creepy, garbage. Its the humor equivalent of someone drawing a dick on a whiteboard, pointing at it, and going, "heheh, look, a penis, hahaha."
Bro just asked if animated chomo bait is bad. LuL, gotta love it in the USA.
The depression kitty looks like if Peter Griffin put on a fursuit and decided to harass minors
Coach Steve is funny
it was practically the worst thing ever animated.. period, no pun intended.
38:31 I’m surprised your analysis did not go into why having a voice actor match the race of a cartoon character is completely counter-intuitive? I would not characterize it as “well and good”. Why is it “well and good”?   It’s an argument that never made sense to begin with.
was season 1 sonic riders ost????
When I was 12 I loved this show
who ever made this show should be put in jail
This show threw me off so much when I watched it because Andrew looks and acts like one of my friends. I couldn't finish the first season because of that. And because it was terrible LMAO
I don't get how a show like this is talked about and watched frequently, but the greatness that is The Life and Times of Tim always struggled to get renewed. I can't even find reviews about it on YouTube 😢  Thankfully there's Ten Year Old Tom now 😊
I mean I liked the first two seasons but it kinda started overdoing it by the third and I got grossed out.   Although, one of the main reasons I dislike big mouth as a whole and this was back from the beginning. It's the fact that it has shitty animation and it's very successful
I honestly like Big Mouth. I thought it was quite funny. And as someone with clinical depression, I could kind of relate with Jess and the depression cat tho I always get really annoyed by Jess.   Season 6 was definitely extremely boring tho. I agree with you- they’ve run out of plot devices. Besides, how long can the characters keep going through puberty? It’s been 6 years already lol.
Todeeee, big marth
“Hey what’s up, Caleb” was pretty funny lol… I like the show 😅
Part of me has to wonder if there was a method to the madness that is the hideous character designs in this series. Like maybe they knew they were going to be animating a lot of, um... questionable... things involving underage kids and that that could attract a certain type of "audience," so they thought "Hey, we should probably make our kid characters as ugly and unappealing as possible to at least *try* and scare the windowless van driver-types away from our cartoon show."
I liked Big Mouth alot initially for just talking about the themes like sexuality and depression and friendship. However,  for myself personally it gets really weird to watch a show about sexual children and preteens. Alot of stuff like the incest storyline, banging pillows, I dunno it started to get too weird for me in some ways and honestly would have been a perfect show if it kept to two -three seasons maybe.  I actually think Human resources is a better show, more concise, more emotion, with the right amount of weird. It's a show I want to see go beyond 2 seasons honestly.
see this is why i like human resources more bc it makes the show make s little more sense
I think adrew didn’t get a love bug in the beginning because he more was confusing love with lust.
I just think the show is funny, but i definitely see how people hate it.
I think big mouth is hated so much because every senario in it is real. Its happened before, its happening now and it'll happen later
I'm sorry, but I feel like you didn't pay attention. Jessie blowing up at her mom was because she just got her first period and didn't want to talk to her about it, blaming her for her humiliation in a juvenile way. Calling her the patriarchy was Jessie parroting her mother. Missy was overwhelmed by the things Andrew was saying in the same clip you showed, muted. Plus she was in a secret relationship that her parents didn't want her to be in, and early Missy would not want to disappoint her parents. Aside from Caleb, only the child they're currently working with can see them, unless they're in the Human Resources department. I think Caleb being able to see them is an "autistic savant" thing, which is honestly a big yikes. Kitty, the depression metaphor did not go away because of the laser pointer. She got *distracted* which is a way your friends can help. Same with the GratiToad. They blurred adult Jessie bc it was an actual sexx scene, not a little sex ed personification. We use the word "sexual" to refer to both, but they're very different things. I doubt any of us got excited looking at STDs in health class. I think that's the ultimate issue most people have with the show, the inability to separate those two concepts.
Loving the choice of using the tekken ost in the background lol
Just one Maury? Next they’ll say there’s just one Jesus!  I did enjoy Big Mouth sending up Bridgerton.  This cartoon YouTube talking head up above me has a based take imo.
Inside Job was good
Can u do review of the inbeetweeners
I love big mouth it’s a fantastic show. I started watching it when I was the same age as the kids in the show and it made me feel less alone and more normal. I also learned a lot about my own body.
Big mouth is awesome.
u complain abt the characters in a show called Big Mouth….. having big mouths?
While I think it has a great portrayal of the horrors of puberty and the hilarious plot, I do think that we should take into account that these are kids being portrayed. And to be honest, seeing a kids genitalia was kind of off putting even if it is a cartoon.
Didn’t watch the video the answer is yes
Who’s watching this after hearing the show will in fact end after the 8th season?
Big Mouth is CP isn't it?
wtf is ur accent dude
I really truly dont see how the lack of consistent rules can be this much of an issue for anyone. This show isn't focused on world building or story, just humor and relaying funny hypothetical scenarios inspired by the writers memories of puberty. Getting mad at this show for not having consistent rules is like getting mad at southpark or courage the cowardly dog or grim adventures of billy and mandy for the same thing. I remember one episode of grim adventures where Mandy destroys all of humanity, and the next episode everything is fine as if nothing changed. And they make references to these events later in the show which confirms that these things did happen in universe and there is some element of continuity, but its not taken too seriously as thats not what the show is about. If these types of shows arenr someone's cup of tea, thats fine, but that doesnt make the lack of rules or continuity a flaw.
Yes.
As soon as I see the thumbnail:       yes.
I maybe some conspiracy theorists who thinks that Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk are descendants of Emperor Palpatine, but Inside Job and Tuca & Bertie got cancelled in order for Netflix to focus more on Big Mouth and i don’t why but I hear voices in my head thinking that both of these were cancelled because Netflix wanted to focus more on edgy and poop humour instead of making stories, Reed Hastings watch around like 200 episodes of Family guy and wants to be like it so he order Netflix to cancel Inside Job and Tuca & Bertie to focus on Big Mouth until he resigned. May sound dumb but I’m maybe right, I’m maybe right about this but if it were true that Inside Job and Tuca & Bertie cancelled because of Big Mouth… That would be terrifying.
I liked it when i was in middle school and early high school but once season 4 came out I looked back on it and realized it was horrible
Yes
as a 13 yr i think big mouth is a great show
I think it's clever the general design and voices, because in paper they're children dealing with their sexuality in a very explicit way, so a weird style and adult voice won't be attractive to p-words
How the writers manage to fuck up such a simple concept confuses me. A hormone monster that represents puberty is literally the easiest metaphor ever.
I know its weird for adults to be writing about cartoon teens going through sexual changes. But the whole staff were all teens once and are all adults playing a cartoon. i prefer BM over movies/shows with kids that have an R rating (but HR is the far superior show out of the two)
Isn't this just glorified child porn
Mom forced me to watch this when i was 11 or 12...it was the part where the red head gets her period and my mom kept laughing at it..i fucking hate this show for more reasons than one 😊
Why dose he keep saying big merth
I’ve found this show weirdly educative I’m on shrooms help
Deee   Ll
Dudes accent cheeses me off
I don’t think the “people will be out of work” argument holds, considering the cast is made up of people who are never off my fucking TV. Now that they’ve befriended Matt Berry, they’re all over UK TV too.
As a texan with a with accent I gotta say this... "big mouwth"
The thing is, it's about middle schoolers. Its just really gross, its the fact they are children, and the show exploits them in a really odd way, they could've done it about highschoolers? But, no, 8th graders are most definitely the one's they HAVE to make it about.
He says mouth 82 times in this video, each in a different way
I love this show!
I hate how the slender man joke made me laugh because of how out of nowhere it was.
I think Nick is the unofficial main character  Such as it’s assumed by the viewer but never fully pushed by the show. Such as shows that have the main characters name as the title vs shows that has no characters name in the title but you still feel like you know who the center is. This is why Andrew can also feel like the main character sometimes
The only criticism I have of the show is the amount of focus that is on sex and horniness. Yes that is apart of puberty but I wished other things were focused on more than a kid that so horny that he’s having sex with any inanimate object. It starts to feel cringe, especially when I think about me being an adult watching a cartoon child having sex with a pillow 😂
i liked it tho :.)
I don't like it. It's too fast, too obnoxious, paired with an ugly art style and cringy jokes.
I may have the facts wrong but I think Big Mouth is one of those shows that is only distributed on netflix or only partially made by them. As in they don't actually invest all that much money into it, and most of it is funded by outside production. So the bar for "success" on the platform is much lower since the size of the viewership doesn't need to be that big to make a profit
Yes, but you know what's worse? the fact that i was going through my day as normal and i had to see that fucking thumbnail, it should be punishable to force people to see such imagery in their youtube home page, i feel violated
Is Maury reformed because that was a dream
He is so wrong about so many things he clearly didn’t understand the show
Would have made more sense to give the female hormone monster to a trans kid rather than nick
I don't know much about this one since I've never watched it, but I can confidently say that this show's art style is one of the ugliest shit I've ever seen
shut up
I personally love it,its funny, the way they animate puberty issues is creative and they do have some good characters like Missy
Every flaw you mentioned in the video, is exactly why I love Human Resources. It fits better because the depth to the story actually exists. You can clearly tell that someone actually cared about the writing. There a maybe two adult animations that have actually made me feel for the characters and their arcs. I feel like a creep watching Big mouth because of how much of the sexual content is saved specifically for the CHILDREN.
"You know what you should shove in your big mouth?" Me: Wait wait wait wait- no no no no no wait wait wait wait
Yes it is bad.
i haven’t watched this show in probably over a year. i forgot how stupid some of the rules of the show are. they monsters should’ve stayed metaphors for puberty and complex emotions. that being said the show has always been a guilty pleasure or mine since it came out while i was in middle school and it actually taught me a lot about my body and it was the first show i was that felt portrayed puberty in a relatable way. now as i get older the show grosses me out more and more and i understand the hate it gets
lmfao bruv, what is this accent
lmfaooo bro exposed big mouth in the first 5 minutes 😂😂😂😂
29:02 You're right about that. I remember first watching Big Mouth  before Season 3 came out, and the Valentine's Day special was released months before Season 3 was, and it was incorporated into Season 3, even at the time.
Why are they pro-abortion...?
I refused to watch it for a long time, thinking that it was just another gross humor adult show ("but this time it's kids? ew"). Then about 2 years ago I binged all seasons and catched up on the new ones that came out. To me it's something I don't have to put any effort in while watching and can just kind of turn my brain off which is why it's actually comforting to watch lol. Plus I think it actually tackles some topics pretty well. Like honestly I learned stuff. And with things I knew about in a more hypothetical or medical manner it was nice seeing like actual characters going through them reflecting how it would be for real people
As a teenager I saw 2 or 3 seasons with my friends and I got a good laugh at it and liked how they were accurate in some points but my opinion will probably change when I grow up so idk
I have to say that I enjoyed Big Mouth in the beginning. I enjoyed a lot of other shows way more but I can't say that I didn't like season 1. I remember having the feelings that they were describing using the MANY METAPHORS in the show when I was going through puberty, especially the Shame Wizard scenes. It just ended up just being more gross than anything else by the later seasons. I ended up HATING most (not all) of the characters by the last season and have no interest in watching further. The only reason I finished the other seasons is because I started them and my OCD wouldn't let me leave them unfinished lol.
The sky is blue
It's a comfort show I watch with my brother. I like it. "It shouldn't have that many seasons" okay? It's a cartoon show. Go touch some grass idk.
I hated my own puberty i don't have energy to suffer a fictional characters as well
Im pretty conflicted with Big Mouth. Some of the situations the characters go through are pretty relative to what i felt growing up. I think it explains those years pretty accurately some of the time. But the visuals. Good God the visuals.  Its hard to say who the target audience of the show is when they go way too far with detail. In idea its a great show that can be an educational tool to understand puberty and how it feels but i think they should've held back a little on the adult humor and animation.
Your accent actually irritates me sorry but the way you say big mouth it sounds like "Big Marfe",
Short answer: Ye Long answer: Yes
I think what a lot of people don’t understand about the pillow pregnancy is that it’s a metaphor for real teen pregnancy without actually putting the characters through that situation. Idk why some people have the idea in their head that all kids are innocent I literally had MULTIPLE friends go through pregnancy scares starting as early as 13. Middle school is hell and this show represents it perfectly
I like big mouth cause it feels relatable, as a teenager. Obviously there’s a lot of outlandish shit but it highlights a lot of experiences and mindsets you have during puberty. First season is my least favorite tbh, feels like they’re trying too hard to be like every other show. The later seasons are better tho
52:43 IS THAT LYLE FROM ONEYPLAYS
Okay, what the hell is this  this is not actual criticisms. These are things that are in all kinds of other shows that are considered to be very very good but the minute it’s this show everyone shuts down about it even you working hard at the start of the movie to separate yourself from the mob mentality surrounding the show are literally changing your opinions in order to fit in with them. This is a joke. I don’t want to watch a video of you just sharing opinions you found on the Internet. I want a unique and sound one big mouth isn’t the best show, but not for these reasons you should hold yourself to a higher standard of work do better
It started ok but fell into politics too much
This show is genuinely one of the worst I’ve seen
Just Google who Nick Kroll’s father is and not only the show’s length, but his whole career will be understood. Nepotism is a crazy thing.
I mean I rather hear them sound like adults than actual kids that is talking about jerking off n shii
It is
You get too bogged down in lore.
Yes.
Can you not pronounce the word mouth or was that intentional. Either way it’s annoying it’s pronounced ow as in you stubbed your toe m-ow-th. I mean fuck.
I honestly tried to watch this show, didn't like it, and then promptly forget it exists until it randomly pops up on Netflix to remind me it exists.. Then I downvote it so I can forget it again.
I acknowledge your point of view in the video, but I must politely express my disagreement. Although the show may appear illogical, it does an excellent job of capturing the tumultuous and bewildering nature of adolescence. These characters are undergoing significant transformations and are bound to make errors. It would be unreasonable to expect them to have everything figured out. Rather than criticizing the show, we should reflect on our own experiences of puberty. Furthermore, there are other creatures to investigate in the spin-off "Human Resources."
this is a bad show in my opinion. i dont think anything could change that to be fair
To add to the whole how is this gettinf renewed but "xyz" got cancelled --- the most surpising thing to me id how high ranked the voice actors are. Theyre not quite A lisf but their time has to bs very expensive
News to me that inside job is cancelled. Thats a bummer because it had potential
I'm still grieving for inside job
I honestly thought Andrew WAS the main character
Big mouth is really shitty but in a good way
This show is aimed at younger teens. It's not going to be as entertaining as an adult comedy to an adult. These kids are growing slowly and sudden outbursts of anger or lust happen. The jokes are priority as well even if they don't fit well. Other Netflix shows deserve what big mouth got though.
Funny. I'm of the opposite opinion. My husband and I love Big Mouth. F is for Family is fucking awful. I'm glad it was canceled because it was as close to literal shit that you can get.
I haven't finished the video yet, but the part about Depression Kitty locking Jessie in a room felt like the writer's wanted to emulate the feeling of dissociation, instead of having her outright say it. Although I hardly doubt that, since they never do this again in the show whatsover.
Human Resources is quite a lot better than the main show. It has a lot of emotional beats and some really touching stories
Big mouth is a great background show. You’ll catch a few laughs when you tune in, but you can ignore everything else
visually, yes. I mean the furrie demons are the best looking people in the show.  😂
Dude you got it all wrong, the hormone monsters are inside the kid's brains, when they talk to the monsters it's like having a conversation in your head fighting unwanted feelings, in this case being horny. Most of the time others can't see the monsters cause they're the kid's emotions. Also, some kids have the same monsters when others don't because some people experience puberty the same way. Did you not watch the show?
couldn't even finish the vid big mouth is shit.
the hormone monsters feel like stands from jojo but everybody can see them
I watched most of big mouth (i havent watched the most recent season) and its not an awful show, it has its awkward/uncomfortable moments. But over all i would consider it mediocre. Its not horrifically bad, but its not overwhelmingly good.
Idfk, I’ve barely seen it lol
big mouth is the best show ever i didnt know it was hated by anyone
The general public: This show is great!  Netflix: CaNcEl It
Not a fan of the show but I wouldn't expect any cartoon to be grounded in reality. It's just there for jokes, even though they might not be good lmao just feels nitpicky
Going through puberty watching this show would be awful. But watching as a full grown nearly 30 year old, god does it make everything I went through so much more relatable
"A company paying for more of something isn't keeping something else that may be better from getting made by said company" Dumb, acting like a company with dwindling payers has enough money to pay for multiple expensie animations. YES, THEM MAKING ANOTHER SEASON OF EXPESIVE GARBAGE DOES HINDER THEM FROM MAKING SOMETHING BETTER. But if people like, watch, and pay for it it will keep going.
Yes
id say im a fan of this show. but in the same way i like paradise pd, its DUMB as SHIT and im not gonna tell you how youre just judging it wrong. its dumb, but it's funny ENOUGH, its interesting ENOUGH. the spin off is surprisingly good tho, i like it wayyyyy more. if big mouth is just enough, human resources is good.  Have your opinions, i genuinely enjoy listening to others critism on shows i like because most of the time i agree even if i like the show :)
big mrÔuth
Big mouth in my opinion is best Netflix original show
i domt have to watch the video yes it is
I feel like that nick kroll thinks this show is actually funny and that is the worst part imo
I feel like the shows main audience is young people who still think cartoons cursing and doing vulgar shit is funny. Cause I really can’t see any other explanation on why people like this show
dude what the fuck is your accent
Yes it is that bad
Is Big Mouth REALLY That Bad: yes
Yes
I bet someone on the bigmouth team is a pedophile
I've never been a huge fan of Big Mouth, and I have some issues with the show, but I can't deny how well they portray some of the topics they decide to cover.
Yes.
It is. It isn't even slightly funny.
At the end of the day, I honestly don't care how good or bad it is because it's so ugly it makes me physically unwell
Ngl this was the funniest ad i watched. That shit looked so bad, then he shows cold potatoes on nasty ass meat 💀💀💀
I watched the whole ass show like more than once and I agreed with everything said here. It's just a big mess of interesting conceps done terribly. Like Jay's weird pillows? have they not thought about that kid being fucking schizophrenic or something or we're just supposed to believe the pillows are alive ?
according to rotten tomatoes black panther is better than forest gump, i wouldn't take their ratings too seriously.
My opinion, it’s not the worst and tends to miss more then it hits for me. It’s a gentle anesthetic for the brain that slowly numbs your brain.
50:05 the choice of music genuinely scared me. Not because the music itself was scary, but because i knew whatever came next would be insufferable
Everything I know about this is, a lot of women I know seem to enjoy it because it jokes about women going through puberty, and the gross stuff that happens in the same way  guys' stuff was joked about for decades, where in most shows it's often untouched on as it's seen as "too far" for some nonsense reason.
Yes.
If your a Loli weirdo this shows for you!!!’
Yes Move on
Surprised it didn’t get canceled when they drawing underage kids genitalia’s
short answer yes
İt looks disgusting idc if it's funny or not i won't watch that shxt
Big mouth was an incredible show for the first few season especially from someone who could relate to it at the time. But recently the story has been confusing and they’re just adding a shit ton of characters and making the story NOT about kids going through puberty and not providing entertaining story’s and lessons. They’ve ruined something that could’ve been one of the best animated shows of all time
This is a great show for teens, not adults (or kids). I say great, though, only because there's not much other things like it out there, that talk about this stuff, in this way.
Honestly, sex jokes are just getting old. Haha! Penis! Look guys! He’s horny and his penis is getting bigger! Haha! There just comes a point to where a shows entire shtick is being an elaborate sex joke gets old.
big marth
Big Mouth show me that many things i was doing was normal and that was nothing wrong with me. Of course is silly and exaggerates many things but when you don't take it seriously, it's really fun to watch
Big mouth is fucking funny idc
Big mouth is just a sad attempt of its creator to normalize his face
I liked season 1 but then season 2 they went wayyy too far and I stopped watching it, I hated the whole political stuff they added it got so bad I had to stop watching
Looiking at the comments people only like it because of nostalgia
Just watched to hear mark say big mouth 20 times
i feel like there’s some good parts on the show but also i don’t need to see children’s genitals even if it’s animated 😬
This show was dogshit sorry not sorry if you watched this in middle school, you were all losers with shit animation tastes. If I was a teenager again and one of you preening cretins tried to talk me into watching this shit I would straight up bully you into an early suicide. Cause this show is for trash people with trash tastes in animation.
I honestly hate how relatable it is. The humor is more crass than I'd usually like and Jay in total is weird but i can assure you Jesse screaming about the particular to her mom out of literal nowhere made me feel extremely called out
19:30 yes. yes it is.
yes problem solved
"yes" ok video over
Yes. Next question?
I dont really see the issue with the monsters only being seen occasionally, i think the monsters just are selective about who can see them and sometimes its played off as jokes. When the weird kid sees Maurey on the bus it's because of just that, he's a weird kid so it's just a nonsensical joke he can see him.  Also the fighr scene example you used, they can't see him, Maurey is in his head at that point, not physically there
I totally get the hate for the artstyle and the humour if it's personally not someone's thing, but i think there's a few criticisms that are a bit silly.   the criticism people have about it sexualising kids and shit is a little silly honestly. Yeah, i guess? But they really dont make the sexual aspects a nice thing, and no one who actually likes that shit is watching this show for that. It's not like Cuties and shit at all...  The frustration about this getting seasons over better shows is fair, but that shouldn't be used to downplay the show itself. And the show is cheap and easy to make and popular... So they produce it   It's a dumb entertaining show and I actually admire it for that. It knows exactly what it is.
Two more adult cartoons that has fallen into the "underappreciated when aired and got cancelled after one season but gained a massive fanbase afterwards"  category
The fact the spin off actually handles puberty better than the original show should already say a lot not to mention every single episode is some sex gag or fucking gag and childhood pornography in a way
Big maurth
I really don't like how much it basically Sexualizes most of the characters, when most people watching are adults, and most characters are Children. That's *my* biggest problem with it
I used to watch Big Mouth but i stopped at some point because some of it grossed me out. I really didn't like the episode where the guy kept having sex with his pillow which came to life.
I was hoping you would deservedley tear this show apart
Big Mouth is a show for groomers who want to molest kids.
Ima go ahead and say it, season 5 was gay asf
The reason why the characters look like that is so they can show nudity and so they wont get recognised as kids. So basically this is loli hentai with extra steps
31:48 South Park did one like this and I thought it did it better
I am a 17 year old and i really enjoy this show because. . . . . . . . . . . . . . Hehe  dick jokes  (yes immature lmaooo) but to me this is like a shit show to watch when theres nothing else on 😅
As a pansexual, I FUCKING HATE the pan character. She's literally biphobic - Her definition claims that bisexual people can't like trans and nonbinary people (common misconception, VERY untrue, most bi ppl like all or most genders). She even outright says that pansexuality is better than bisexuality because bi is "too binary." I HATE that shit. I know there are pan people who really are biphobic, but what she says isn't contradicted in any way, which makes me think that the writers agree with her and are also biphobic. It's absolutely horrible representation, for pans AND for bis :(((
No hate at all but he sounds Irish mixed with American
Big mouth is just glorified cp. straight up a ton of nudity for supposedly preteens💀
It's a good show honestly. I wasn't even aware of the hate about it until this year. Not cult, but decent with some great moments.
I'm around 40 minutes in and I want to state my opinions on why I love Big Mouth.  The biggest thing with me is that my favorite genre is comedy and I like when things are pushed past society's comfort zones and show things that need to be talked about but not in a serious and in-depth way. Big mouth is a show that's not trying to be revolutionary with tackling puberty. It may have story arcs and progress from episode to episode but it's mainly a show where you can watch any episode in any order and still enjoy it. Like you said in the video, the artstyle seems gross but that's on purpose. The adults look better than the kids to exaggerate puberty which is the whole point of the show. Do the adults look stellar? No of course not but it's better to stand out even if ugly, than to go the safe route and imitate the artstyle of other shows and get forgotten because of it.  You can call it brain dead, simple, and just unappealing which is completely fair but with me and so many others, that's the whole point. A show to tackle things everyone has related to in a funny way that's not trying to be anything more than it already is. I don't expect more from it. When I watch Big Mouth, I expect Big Mouth. Something shocking, relatable, not too serious, and overall a subjective taste in comedy.
As someone who watched the show, I was not comfortable at any point watching.
I watched it at first, but it got more and more uncomfortable. By the time we were watching a child having sex with a personified bag of soup, it felt really fucking creepy. And then they canceled that other animated show with Ali Wong and I was pissed. I can’t watch adult women tell stories about their sex lives, but I can watch season after season of Nick Kroll’s pedo shit?
This show is so goddamn ugly I cannot get over it
ngl im actually still pissed about inside job being cancelled
43:10 you'd be surprised how many people need to hear those basics. I deadass recommended Big Mouth season 4 to a few friends who desperately needed to hear the basics again. Idk I think the story/characters have built up well over the seasons. Some of the jokes/criticisms you have seem like you're taking it too seriously/literally? I mean they definitely cross the line with how they went about certain topics, but the subtext is pretty relatable/educational/exhale worthy.
23:20 Isn't that supposed to be irony o:
I only seen like 20 minutes of this show when my stoner friends at the time showed me, I told them no cap but this is fucking ass. It’s hard to find decent weed smoker friends anyway so whatever
Will not watch the video, watched all the seasons to hate on it more accurately, answer is yes, only brainwashed american can like this ( american is a synonym for "retarded" in the rest of the world ).
this show is jewish garbage
You know Mark saying “Not that I would know” to the smoking segment is making me think he does know.
What happened to the thumbnail?
This was the subject for a far side comic that somehow became a show without the talent of Gary Larson. Do you have a parasitic arachnid named after you Nick Kroll?! I thought not.
I loved watching Big Mouth and i though the plot was genius but I honestly got tired of how they can tell a good story, makes it compelling to then just smir shit all over it and make it pointless. Is like you can never really expect anything intelligent from any character. I get that teens are unpredictable, but that doesn't make them brain dead. I was so soo disappointed when real life Nick appeared, it felt so...out of place and cringy like you give 0 fucks about world building just for what?? Not even a funny joke it was bad.
it's a comedy so it doesn't necessarily have to be looked at logically...
This show fuckin blows... I watched 2 episodes and will never watch it again. It's not fuckin funny...
I like that he says most people probably don't pay attention to inconsistencies while watching and that hormone monsters being seen sometimes and other times not etc might be some people's favorite parts of the show. But it makes me wonder why he then shits on these exact things for 20 mins of the video. This show was made for teens going through puberty to watch, this kind of comedy helps a younger audience stay connected to the actual plot where they are exposed well to how to handle a lot of puberty related issues. The way the hormone monsters are handled are one of my favorite things, he conveniently left out when jessi, nick, and Andrew are in HR that nick talks to his real self and tells him the hormone monsters are a part of them and that really they are shitty and have nothing to blame but themselves. That was the realization moment he said the show lacked as a coming of age show. In reality this show is entertaining, picking apart the inconsistencies for being inconsistent misses the point of the scenes. A lot of this seems to be opinion based as well, like saying he doesn't like the animation style, specifically the eyes. Is this video supposed to be an object view of big mouth and if it's good or his opinion on it?
I felt Big Mouth suddenly “sold out” and folded to woke political ideology, one of the later seasons practically doing a 180. This show that started with s*x education, boys going through puberty -together but at different stages, girls going through puberty, generalizations like shame, anatomy of the female reproductive system on the chalk board, first times, raging hormones and hilarity- first kisses, first period, first wet dream - the very concept practically based on male and female pubescent kids going through puberty and learning about themselves and life. To suddenly start a season with Jessi shaming her pregnant step mum and educating her on the concept of gender neutrality, and wanting this first time pregnant female woman to adopt this like 13 year olds newly discovered enlightenment that she knows almost nothing about but becomes gung-ho badgers at her to raising the child in a  gender non-conforming and non-binary bedroom and household, and not raising the kid to be either a boy or a girl. I just couldn’t. It was comedy before, and then it became forced and frankly absurdly hilarious that the show with the roots it had, suddenly seeming preachy. It’s humour was being inappropriate, raw, real,  relatable… it was “inappropriate” that I thought made it funny, and to release a season where it became politically correct and appropriate what it for me. It died. It wasn’t the same show anymore. Like the last episode of Dexter, it was a dud! There was a song of “how everyone has v@g!n@5”, if I recall, and at that point, I just couldn’t..
32 minutes into the video and I’m still trying to figure out what “beg maurth” is
Why the fuck do you say mouth like that
i like big mouth i know im the odd one out most people iv talked to dont like it im not afraid to say it i  like it
Good news, it's ending after the 8th season
They just announced that it’s 8th season will be the last one. So…not staying for much longer
Don’t worry guys the final  season of big mouth is season 8
Yes it is
As a teen who went thru puberty I just don’t want to watch other young teens go thru puberty in a show
I don’t see the hate I like big mouth lol
i feel like if they took a similar approach with the monsters and enchantment does with luci it would have worked a lot better  where like everyone sees them but not everyone knows what they actually are/can understand them
I've said multiple times and I'll say it again: THIS IS A TEENAGER ANIMATED CARTOON, not an adult animated cartoon. This series was AMAZING for me to watch as I was going through puberty, and I'm kinda mad about the hate it gets for talking about this topics of sexuality in teenagers.
Yes.
I recognize that coach Steve is a terrible character but I still love him. I could not tell you why.
im sorry i fucking love big mouth, its crude and gross but god damm it makes me laugh
I absolutely love big mouth, is it that good?? not really. But the way that it shows puberty is really accurate to how much teens feel. I don’t think it deserves more seasons though
Every Big Mouth season just keeps getting worse and worse
I watched this show all the way through, each season as it was released. I completely forgot that seasons 5-6 even existed at all. Like, there is no memories at all
Why mouth big
Big mouth was made by and for pedofiles. Period.
bro its a cartoon....
14:55 Nah, teenage outbursts like that DEFINITELY happen, especially during the rebellious teenage-phase.
When it wants to tackle a serious topic around peer pressure or genuinely just growing up id say the delivery is ok. Not great, ive seen other shows do miles better but what it does it does decently... Until you get to the fuckin hormone monster so unless you want to ignore 60% of the show, i wouldn't recommend it
I get that big mouth has certain things going for it but I cant stand that horrid animation style, coupled with its awful story telling and frankly annoying narrative, makes me wonder why it ever got greenlit past season 1
I started watching this when I was 18 I loved it but I slowly started drifting out of it but I’m ok with that I’m 24 now the shows. Not for people who get older
I love big mouth tbh. I relate so much to Jay. I found out I was bi in middle school. I was also addicted to mastu*bation lol so yeah it's actually good
Yes it is
Any other adult animated show is better. Why is it even a question? The real question is why are the better shows being shut down immediately after one season or before the first season even finishes
Yeah, it is that bad.
Big Marrrth
Yes it is that bad
Im so sorry to say that bc if it’s your way of doing videos I can not complain abt it but, maybe you should add a little more of calm song instead of really speed song that made it hard to keep up with what your saying 😅
I actually like big mouth, it's validating in a way to see that the misery of puberty is normal. Hang on you said that missy blows up out of nowhere and breaks it off but I feel there's a strong lack of empathy for the situation missy was in. Iirc yeah she pushed for it, why can't she change her mind? It reminds me of a TikTok scandal a few years ago where a red-filtered naked body shot was trending and a lot of underage girls wanted to do it to, not knowing that the videos could be (and they were, shared on a subreddit) edited to show everything, instead of the black silhouette put on by the filter. These girls were exercising their newfound sexuality without understanding the grander concept and consequences of doing so. Missy wanted a kiss, she is sexually driven, but she didn't want to keep up with the emotional pressure he was putting on her. Dude.
I don’t care I like the show and I think it’s funny therefore I will disregard your opinion.
To save some viewers some time yes it is bad 👎
You know I feel like this could be biased comparing the thumbnail to the profile picture...
its ugly as sin but the humor is good and clever at times and some of the story arcs are actually quite interesting, its weird when a show can be so crude and dark in its humor but also can focus on real world teen/family/life issues (it also got much better after s1 when they actually got around to crafting the characters and world building (kinda? s1 kind of messed alot up ironically) , i dont think the team actually expected to get more than 1 season)
Short answer? Yes
I just find it sad how people hate this show like I really really like it
Big mouth gets all these new seasons, yet Netflix cancels Final Space 😔
ur so canadian bro😭
LS MARK PLUSHIE
I love big mouth, it came out when I was 13 and it actually opened up a conversation about puberty between my friend and I. I still watch it from time to time, +it was nice seeing the episode about leah because I honestly relate to her the most now.
Whenever I see a video critiquing big mouth it's like people forget that it's just a fucking cartoon and doesn't need to be consistent 100 percent of the time. People bring up inconsistencies about big mouth all the time but look at family as the gold standard of an adult cartoon.
I hate big mouth sm omg
When I heard “Self-insert”, I knew I was In for a ride.
I hate how accurately you can copy the art style of part the shows you review in your thumbnails.
I think this show is almost nostalgic in a way to me because I watched it when I was 11/12, which was definitely too young, but in the subsequent years I experienced a lot of the things in the show (Jessie's sexuality arc hit pretty hard especially) so even though the art style is sucky, I do like the show
Dude I can’t believe Mark hasn’t made a video on King of the Hill yet, I can’t think of a cartoon that develops its characters better. Also the smoking episode is classic.
Yes. Yes it is.
Is it me or does that part where Nick meets his voice actor giving me Sausage Party post credit scene vibes? Ironic since he voiced the villain in that movie, being a literal Douche.
if anyone from the west trys to bitch about japanese/eastern media sexualizing children after this "hit" show sorry but they have no point.
A sonic rush theme in the back?…. Excellent choice old man
Man what did you went so bad into the inconsistent of the monster it actually dosent care or at least just accept its inconsistent and move on f k jesus god 10 min of this
Maury is basically horny ryuk (death note). Big mouth is pretty much death note meets inside out.
It's because Nick Krolls family is insanely rich and well connected... also the other thing.
I loved big mouth from season 1 onward. You haters can all go to hell.
Yes.
for me recently I feel like jay and matthew’s storylines are the ones that I’m actively interested for when it comes to this show. most of the characters, heavily on nick, are starting to feel really repetitive and annoying lol but at least for matthew and jay there’s SOME form of development. but yeah human resources is pretty good when it comes to actual storylines
38:03 this part is CRAZYYY
I personally like this show, its in my top 10's
Groomers. Groomers happened
So reading these comments, here’s my gauge for the general audience : Autistic tumblr kids
big mourth
I love big mouth lol
I think nick kroll himself said he was a narcissist. Or “ a firm advocate for his own happiness”
Huh, didn't know this show was so progressive... that somehow pisses me off knowing that it's this show doing it.
when i was around 13, i really liked this show, i haven't watched it in a while though
HEHEHHEHe the mumkey jones refrence made me giggle
i hate big mouth because middle schooler having sex and being naked is gross
This show has a few genuine inconsistencies but it also has internal logic that you seem to miss/glaze over. The monsters are personified emotion, they are in fact not physically there, but are very real in the sense that the emotions they represent dictate action. You also missed some key characters and got a few details wrong. Feeling like you kinda coasted through this....
First time I smoked walls melted
I remember watching this show in my early high school years. My friend had a little brother who was in grade 6ish who also enjoyed it and we would talk about the show together sometimes. It was cool talking to a kid who was viewing it through the eyes of someone who was the same age as the characters vs why I liked it as someone who was just finishing my worst "puberty years"
Fuck you I love coach steve
The entire time I watched big mouth I never thought in a million years that it was bad. In fact I thought it was hilarious and funny I never considered that people would be offended by a cartoon making jokes about funny things. I also found it very help when dealing with my own awkwardness.
“lack of rules” u sound like a fucking need. we’re here to watch a cartoon
this video did not have to be an hour and ur trying to not find it funny on ouspose. “stupid jokes that don’t make sense” that’s the funniest part. people have different senses of humor. i’m skipping half of this shit but ur like wrong and making shitty points and this is a bad video
“Big mæth”
I don't defend everything they have done, but yea, Depression Kitty is on point. Maybe its just me though. It's less about staying in bed and feeling weighed down. Some people can't get out of bed, but I was raised that you get up and get out to do stuff so I do. But I constantly feel tired and don't want to do anything. I just eat junk food and anything I know is just completely garbage. It's accurate. At least to me. This is one aspect I will actively defend.
I really think the issue with big mouth is that it blurs the line to some people in the vulgarity at the end of the day you're dealing with our children and sex if this would be live action it would probably be banned for child sex stuff in some places I'm not saying I agree but I think that's a major issue people have with it
i think people forget that not everyone watching is a grown adult… some kids/teens might watch it cause its edgy but if ur like me you watch it because this show came out when you were a girl in 7th grade who RELATED to knowing about how awful growing up can really be .. and were also obsessed with john mulaney…
i never liked it, its really gross and just isnt that funny
It’s shit
I hated it when it came out cus I thought it was ugly but there's actually a few episodes that really hit me emotionally so I love Big Mouth. Recent seasons aren't as good though
I watched the first 2 seasons. And it was just getting hard to watch. Some of the characters are so fucking annoying.
I suffered about 3 episodes before quitting. It's just not my thing. Maybe teenagers love it, I don''t know.
O avatar desse cara parece o cartoonizando....
you should watch human resorses
You also have to consider the shows fickleness with relationships and other things reflects the fickleness of relationships and life with being a teen
I literally am smoking and eating pizza while watching this with my fat ass dogs!
It’s 💯 a dumb, dumb show!
Thank GOD! “Sweet Home” is getting a season 2-3 😅🤣
yeah it is
This show is such a mixed bag. Honestly it’s only consistently funny when you’re extremely not-sober, but there is some genuinely good stuff. While also having a ton of bad and… uncomfortable things. And not uncomfortable how the showrunners intended
I am so glad Jewish writers and creators like nick kroll are getting the recognition and acknowledgement they deserve with shows like this. It’s about time and I for one am glad to see Jewish creators explore challenging concepts like child sexuality and explicit deconstruction of traditional taboos.
I don't care how good the writing is won't make me like it it's art style is awful and puts me off.
I might just be pretentious, but taking a bunch of obvious metafors and run with them as literal cannon constantly making it ambiguous what is real lr not is imo the genius of the show. Kind of like American psycho tbh.
I enjoyed Big Mouth and watched it entirely along with Human Resources. But I'll never be comfortable with the pillow scenes
I've never seen this show. Honestly it doesn't seem like a show I could legitimately relate to.
i genuinely don’t understand the moral panic surrounding this show. i’m personally not a fan, but some people act like it’s literally CSAM or something when all it is is an ugly lowbrow cartoon.
I think part of what makes me hate this show is that my parents wouldn’t watch South Park or family guy, but they watched this garbage.
"Oh no, the show i loved got cancelled but the show i dislike gets renewed i should feel happy for them despite being exactly the opposite of what i wanted" his initial argument
I loved Kroll Show but I find Big Mouth disgusting on several levels. Character design, animation quality, subject matter. The sexual content with children is really deserving of its criticism and it’s just horrifically cringey and unfunny.
The point of "Why did this show get cancelled when Big Mouth is still on," isn't that everyone who watches Netflix are hypocrites. It's that there is clear talent behind shows like Inside Job and that they scored well with audiences. Big Mouth is only up because it wins Netflix accolades. The argument of, "Yeah, but Big Mouth scores well critically" or, "But there is high praise on *site XYZ*" is moot if the majority of people who watch adult animation dislikes it. Using the critical score to fend of hate is just an appeal to authority, like saying a work of modern art where someone pissed on a wall is good because a critic appraised the wet cinderblocks for millions. The first bit of the video really caught me off guard because it's as if you seem to understand this fact, that the majority of the people who watch this show come away hating it, but disregard them as "toxic" out of obstinance, justifying it by disregarding the reason WHY this show is getting hate and other "good" adult animation isn't. If you want to create objective analysis, it may be a good idea to not drive away the group of people who may disagree with you within the first minute or so in an hour long review.
Big mouth was entertaining for the first two seasons and then resorted purely to shock factor with nonsensical storylines (and not the fun kind of nonsensical but annoying and random for no apparent reason)
i was in college when this show first came out and me and my friends loved it and thought it was hilarious. i still stand by the fact they have one of the best all time intros lol. after the first couple seasons the humor took a weird fucking turn and it was just uncomfortable to watch, so i stopped watching and never went back  Edit: OMG YUPP the episode with Jay with the fucking pillow was literally the moment i stopped watching
The whole "hormone monster being real thing" I agree with you that everyone should've had their own, in different shapes and stuff. But anyway, it feels like they're going for it *is* the personification of hornyness and reflects the person's mental state. In said fight, (or maybe it was another scene I don't remember) he swaps sides going from supporting each one and taking their point of view "We only did this because XYZ (angry)" to "But that was a really bad thing to do (sad)" etc. And so they're not actually there and talking to them. Like when you talk to the hormone monster nobody else hears it or comments on it so it's like an inner outer dialogue kinda deal.  For me the humor is all over the place. Some jokes made me laugh really hard and caught me off guard. But I only laugh at all like...maybe 1/3 of the time.  Big agree about the animation stuff. I hate it, but I got over it I guess.
One thing about Big Mouth is I can’t name a single other show in my lifetime that’s tackled puberty this bluntly. And I appreciate that! I learned more about vaginal health from Nick Kroll than my own mother lol.
Is he putting on this voice? Like no hate but every last word of a sentence goes on 😂
Big Mouth is an okay show. Don't blame the show that other shows getting canceled. The other shows probably weren't popular enough unfortunately. Big Mouth is clearly doing something right that it is still going keep in mind Netflix tracks what people are and aren't watching, how long and how much. If you are watching a Netflix show off Netflix you aren't supporting it.
Big Mouth feels like an attempt to recapture the Drawn Together audience while being too scared of cancellation to properly employ shock humor, every potential joke gets squandered because they have to explain to you that they're making a point and that they're not actually sexist/racist/homophobic, all while there really isn't anything in the show itself that is any more shocking than South Park to hold your attention.
Hi j😅  I ui   K😊
I was afraid to watch this cause Big Mouth has become my comfort showand it makes me sad it gets the hate it does. I was immediately drawn to it, because I like adult animation and honestly it looked funny.    It's crazy how relatable it is to me and I think all the characters are really well written, the songs are great and the style's different.  I wouldn't call it ugly.
i fucking hate 90% of musical pieces in adult cartoons. Why the fuck do almost all of the big ones do it? Its like they are trying to prove to each other that they can, and it usually sucks, isn't funny, and almost never adds to the plot. Not to mention the music itself being bland at best and tedious and cringey at worst.  Simpson's musical pieces suck almost all the time, same with family guy. South Park is the only one that can kind of do it and half the time they are lame as well. Big mouth can't handle it and the amount of resources and time that goes in to a music piece would be much better spent actually developing some better jokes and writing. Fucking bullshit!
Yes. It's disgusting and borderline feels like it should be illegal.
4:59 pretty much my feelings on it  I was fine with the show being semi realistic with 'Mona the Vampire' logic for Ghosts/the Hormone Monsters  then the Pillow gave birth and a realised all bets were off
The part that gets me is that this is a show aimed at adults that puts children in sexual situations. It's creepy as fuck??  I could understand there being an animated show about puberty that's MUCH more toned down than this, with the goal of helping minors understand how puberty works. But obviously leaving out the creepy, weird-ass sexual shit this show does. But this show is just creepy as hell with how it handles things. And the fact alone that a show like this is popular, raises me some red flags. Who's enjoying watching kids in these creepy situations so much? Heck, even this video mentions the Hormone Monster trying to convince a character, a CHILD, to jerk himself off at a slumber party. This show is fucking creepy as hell.  That being said, I think a show like this could really work out well if it wasn't for the weird gross-out shit and how 'into it' the show gets. I feel like the writers sometimes forget these characters are children, and some of the shit they do in this show is questionable at best.
Idk about you but i love this show lmao me and my bf watch it all the time and laugh our asses off
All the hate for Velma has me considering making an actual video, cause I feel like I saw something different than what most people did
Don't watch the show. Was put off of it probably around the shame wizard.  Don't really remember.  Good video, though I can't place your accent and it's really distracting. It's subtle enough to go unnoticed until there are any hard a sounds.
The fact some people will only know changes from this show is a sin
Short answer: yes Long answer: this video
Where is your accent from. You of course don’t need to say, but I have never in my life heard one like it. I apologize if I’m being rude, languages and accents fascinate me.
Big Mouth taught me self love while i was still a high schooler. i honestly relate to the characters a lot, im a weirdo whos kind of an asshole like all the characters in the show, its not perfect but im a big fan of the show and its spin off. lol tho ive hated Rick and Morty since that shows first episode so what do i know about "good" shows
The show always creeped me out because of Nick Krull. I will not expand on this comment.
Not that theyre necessarily important to the plot its kinda weird to me you didnt even mention the songs, some are god awful like coach steves sex song, but some like the shame wizards 2 (3 technically but on is just a 10 second dubstep mini song) songs are really well done and actually catchy
Breaking: local man spends 56 minutes taking in all resources available only to completely ignore all of it and come to conclusion he already had
So I'm 25 year old female, but I actually do like Big Mouth! I really wish I watched something like that in middle school. I will admit that it is definitely getting a lot more cringe because it is trying too hard at some points. But I'll watch it.
I watched Big Mouth when I was 15 and I really liked the show at first. Now I'm 17, and I'm incredibly disturbed by all of it. It's absolutely disgusting and definitely being marketed to kids.
Big mithe
the show is funny and it has its moments, but there are a lot of scenes and ideas that should’ve gone out of the window. what started out as making satire out of puberty turned into little to no character development and each character making god awful decisions that barely or at best awkwardly advance the plot forward
This video has made me feel a bit better about consuming so many seasons of big mouth
I think Big Mouth lasted for six seasons because it’s so relatable
This is a show by pedos for pedos. There is nothing funny or smart about the sexualization of children.
I actually really love Big Mouth, it's like a huge guilty pleasure for me.
here's the thing. Visually it makes me want to puke. Story-wise I simply feel uncomfortable at best. I know there are ppl that like it cus my sister is one of those. Maybe she just relates more to the crap and doesn't want to bleach her brain each time a clip passes on their fyp.
They show child genitals  That’s weird, no matter how u wanna spin in lmao
I’d argue the Human Resources show is probably better than this one. Let’s be honest, everybody only watched this shit for hormone monster jokes and cringed at all the weird shit, especially if you consider the most recent season, honestly most of it just made me uncomfortable
Can you not pronounce ou like you have a boulder in your mouth
25:25 first time I ever used the Devil’s Lettuce I was literally seeing those trippy stoner posters they used to sell at Spencer’s.
I like the show, personally. BUT-- Kardashian butt-- I don't like the uncensored depiction of kid's genitalia.
Big Mouth brought us Human Resources which is SUCH a brilliant show
I dont love Big Mouth, but I do like watching it when I turn my brain off (tho I do get second hand embarrassment in parts). Glad to see someone not just hating on the show, but also stating on what they can change!
Honestly my problem with the show is I felt like as the show went on it kept trying to push gross out humor and shit like that. As it went on it became less and less grounded and the gross humor started to become about shock value. Also I can’t say the argument about ch!ld p0rn is unfounded. I mean, there’s literally an episode where Jay’s brothers force him to eat crackers with their cum on it. No joke I almost threw up watching this episode.
Can you say "hone in on their craft"?
Who is this show for? There's some things that are informative things for like 12 year olds, but the rest of it seems like it's a retrospective for older teens and adults to be like "'Member how bad this was?" Who is the target demographic??
I have to tell you man, this show is literally made by pedos. This show is the epitome of "Featuring: The Writer's Barely-Disguised Fetish"
Hate me all you want, but I have to say this show is a masterpiece.
Tbh I think Netflix stopped funding the show forever ago… if you’re a producer who is wealthy and committed to the show, why not continue to fund it yourself?
Yes yes it is
Close Enough being cancelled, because it is not the target audience of Netflix, a show aimed at 25+ year olds struggling with inflation, having dreams and trying to fight off the soul crushing reality, or even the shadow cabal (or inside job), aimed at 30-somethings trying to achieve something, while this show is aimed at 12 year olds, while costing Netflix (and I am not joking, they have no ROI far that sh*tfest of a show) gets another season is more than dissapointing. And not a single person can excuse it with: "but we pay for it", no, your parents pay for it, 80% of netflix subscribers are people the age between 25 and 40, you are just a parasite using your parents money, but by having a lot of free time you dictate what we are forced to watch
i personally dont get all the big mouth hate, i love all seasons and have rewatched it multiple times, i dont think its a bad show, i think people are just hyper critical
INSIDE JOB IS CANCELED?!?  NO?!?  MY WILL TO LIVE!   THAT WAS MY STUFF!  AND FOR WHAT, MAKING ROOM FOR FART-ZARS19?  NO!!!  DON'T SAY IT!
Honestly, I don’t think it’s a coming of age story. I think it’s audience is adults who are looking back at their childhoods with the cynical, maybe forlorn outlook on the world. Sure, the humor may not hit all the time, but I know plenty of people in late 20s-early 30s that see it as purely a comedy, with some added bits about growing up. The anxiety episode actually made me cry 😅
Holy fuck this dudes voice
I think it’s primarily the recent allegations and exposure of Hollywood creeps over the last fees years. And with a handful of those (quite proven) creeps voice acting a show about sexualized children is just a spit in the face from elitist individuals who have yet to be charged for those crimes.  That point was skipped entirely in this video and that has been the primary factor fueling the hate behind the show. Not hard to grasp
Of course talking about the GAY CHARACTER is easy for you, Mark.
seems a little biased
Literally american Evangelion
38:32 Why does it matter for the race of the voice actor to match the character?
I fw big mouth idc it’s genuinely pretty funny especially when you’re high so yehhh another season wooo
i really enjoy big mouth - it normalizes topics around puberty that not many people talk about. many preteens/teens struggle and feel like they are alone during puberty, and this show normalizes the behaviors they were resenting.
I actually resonated with the period episode, only for my approval to instantly be taken away when the pillow episode came.
Whenever someone wants a show incorrectly assessed I recommend this channel.
Bro that chicken looks awful thx for the warning
You gotta talk about F is for family
Yes. Yes it IS that bad. It should be a crime to show me this.
this has barley any relevancy to the video but the f is for family art style is bad?? like its not amazing but its fine to look at and i honestly like it
This guy can't pronounce mouth
He didn’t realize he was saying big marth the whole time 💀💀💀
I personally never liked the art style and figured it was just gonna be another adult humor Netflix show so I never bothered
I like big mouth
I feel the same way with their use of weed. I kind of get upset when a show take’s psilocybin because it’s not even close to accurate. Yes I get psychedelics is very colorful & with animation you can make it very over the top & full on mystical experience (very rare in real life) a mystical experience is so intensely powerful you only want to experience it once.
I couldn't give a shit about the art style, it's just not funny and it's also kinda gross
I enjoy watching Big Mouth but gave up on F is for Family within 2 episodes. Different strokes for different folks I suppose.
It's a great show because we can all relate to the pains of at least 1 of them growing up
Hey man why is your accent like that. Let your norn iron accent flow naturally instead of this weird fake american accent
My wife and I enjoyed the show all the way up until Jay starts licking mud out of what’s her Cunt‘s toes and we stopped after that.
omg are you American or irish ??? why is it confusing me sooo muchh
Good and great overall video! Spent 56 minutes cringing at the terrible plot of Big Mouth, but it was bearable with your sense of humour + commentary.
As much as I love this show, I just couldn’t get through this season of Big Mouth.
I don't know how puberty was for you, but back in the 80s, mine was alot like this show. Inconsistent, chaotic, full of mistakes, etc. Even at 50yo, I feel like my hormone monster still visits me from time to time.
seems a bit too puerile. Adolescent. It insists on itself.
Big mouth blows even when Nick Kroll talks about morality in a flanderized show that's based on random puberty where I see him being bleak and lazy to be the status quo of human resources.
Yes. You don’t need to make 50 minute video on it, hell YOU don’t need to make a video on it, we know it is, and whatever reasons you have on your long ass video or reasons why it’s actually good (which would just make you look worse) are prolly not worth sticking so long to hear
The series isn't about how puberty changes you. The serie is about how growing up feels akward and sucks. You are just nit picking the series because you don't get it. Not everything you don't understand is bad. Sometimes you just not there yet.
I'm pretty sure the big blue alien was just a scientology joke
YES, it is
I see your points  But I counter with        It's just so f***ing ugly        I win
This show has the uglisest art style. Even worse than rugrats
Okay but I love big mouth
What's this guy's accent
I like the show to a certain point. But they should have cut it off after a while. But some of the jokes are funny….some of them. Like a hand full.
Anyone know what the background music is around 36:40 - 37:00 ?? Really like it for the brief moments you can hear it
My friend who was starting to question her religion cited this show as one of the things that helped her feel more comfortable about the things her religion said should be repressed. I feel like when the show hits, it really hits. And when it misses, it really misses. It’s genuinely funny and enjoyable but has sooooo many wtf and excessive moments. I literally had to take cringe breaks and watch the episodes a couple weeks or months apart because I hated the Nick character and Rick hormone monster, plus Jay and his nasty pillows.
“i don’t like it because i’m not the target audience”
What. F is For Family was way worse than Big Mouth.
This is not the video I would except to hear a bunch of Tekken music in the background.
Big mouth has a higher rating on rotten tomatoes than Breaking Bad. Ok.
This show is pedophilic propaganda aimed towards children!
How many syllables does your accent require you to pronounce "mouth" with
'RANDOM ACTOR SHE LIKES' ?!?!?!
I accidentally had this on 1.75x speed for like 5 minutes before realizing the edibles have hit
As a Rad-Trad Catholic, I hate this show. Nothing is more gross than sexualizing children and promoting degenerate sinful content.   Sex however, is beautiful and coming of age with puberty, which is all natural and perfectly fine, but we can not succumb to our feelings and embrace all of our bad sinful effeminate behavior.  Before I get rage replies, I would like to "Get off of my high horse", and approach you with humility and give a foot note on my backround, because I am very much qualified to speak out about this topic, because I am a victim of my own actions. I am not a "Craddle born" Catholic, and I was not raised very Christian at all. I am a recent convert to the church and to many of its practices. Before though, I was a huge sex fiend and I struggled with many of the problems that the character in Big Mouth did. I masturbated at the age of 8-9. When I discovered late night TV-14 in 2005 and it progressively got worse when I found a pornographic magazine and also porn on the internet. I have been a slave to those sins for years. I have rotted my brain and my soul because of it. I lost my virginity at the age of 14 and had sex with many women since. Trying to get a quick kick and to fill some kind of empty void in my life. Every time I would do it, I would feel deeply depressed and ashamed. I created so much darkness, brain fog, loss of innocence, and guilt all for a few seconds of "Pure blissful, dopamine filled pleasure". I PRAY, I could change the past and stop myself and keep my sacred, beautiful virginity, but I can't. Instead, I must repent and make up for what I have done. To not only save my soul, but also my purity and my innocence.   After converting, I can now see women for their true beauty and not as a sex toy and as potential notch addition on my list of sex partners. Sex isn't the end all be all. Sex really isn't anything anyway, it's a fleeting moment that will come and go while you're left standing hallow, sad and ashamed.  It's NOT too late people. There is hope and salvation in Jesus Christ. I ruined my youth and early adult life, but you don't have to. You can learn from my mistakes.    I like to clarify, the church and I are not anti-sex, on the contrary, we think it is one of the most beautiful things God has ever made. And he made it to be very pleasurable and fun, for us humans to partake in. But he made it, for the purpose to be done, within the confounds of marriage. When the two partners, give their bodies to one another and become one spirit...THAT is beautiful and glorious.  The sin, isn't sex. The sin IS having premarital sex with a partner or "rubbing one out". Sexual lust is the core sin. It's evil and unfair to you future married spouse. You have already let them down, because of your past actions. I'll use an example of the nature of a sinful act and what people might falsely presume to be a sin. So, smoking cigarettes...Sinful or not? Not entirely....Smoking a cigarette or a few, here and there, to release yourself of stress is fine. However, it can be a sin when you become addicted to it, and you make it into an idolatrous act. You're also harming your body, which we are told to be the caretakers of and respect and care for our bodies like a temple. That same principle of disecting an action and investigating it for sin can be applied to almost anything, such as drugs, alcohol sex.
I may be the only one that actually kinda enjoys big mouth 😭
I liked big mouth because I didn't think about it, jokes are funny if you don't bother thinking about them. If you go into a show being critical then your just doodling yourself to have a bad time.
i like that mark is always optimistic and sees positives when there's positives while still being ruthless as fuck
I think i made it 5 min into episode 1. Its genuine garbage.  Critical acclaim means jack shit. The entertainment industry is payola
I always thought Andrew was the main character
yeah it's that bad, end of discussion, you're retarded if you think otherwise. gg
I did absolutely think Will Arnett voiced Maury until that episode where they joke about it lol
Literally child porn laws state this is child porn
Lol I can see why I didn't keep watching this now. I thought maybe I was just getting old but nope, looks like it really was garbage.
Plëz stop talkën like thëzz
Honestly I can't decide if I like the show or not. I flip between liking it and disliking it quite a bit.
LS mark voice: big maurth
46:57 I noticed that you're using Iori's KOF 96 theme here. You definitely have great taste in video game music.
So.... basically everything you don't like about the serie is exactly what I like
It's so bad
I got bored of the show by half way though season 4. It was just crude for the sake of being crude.
Wanting shows you like to continue and  shows you don't  like to be cancelled isn't  hypocritical,  just  selfish.
YES.
it's actually a pretty cool show, people want to dunk on it just because of how young the characters are and the mature issues they face
Big mouth is pretty funny to me ngll
4:13 Hey! That's not true! He's also known for the acclaimed role of the literal douche in Sausage Party...
"hold the phone, IS THAT F@CKIN' FORTNITE???" Well he is 13
YES it is
the way he says mouth bothers me so much
What’s the background music? 12:51
I liked big mouth. It was funny and relatable, not to mention that it deals with diverse and taboo topics. Missy learning to accept her biracialism, talk abt periods, depression, asexual character, panic attacks, etc. A lot of topics that media hadnt learnt to talk abt yet, even though  they're fairly common.  I also feel like including your opinion of the art style here was kinda useless, bc its a very "personal" opinion. You might not like the art style, but some people do. It's impossible to please everyone, and you bringing up the art style complaint feels like you just want to have more things to criticize it for, to give the illusion that the show truly sucks more than it does
My biggest criticism about having a comparison before puberty is that puberty is not hitting you like a truck. It’s gradual changes and there can be a huge amount of character development through those stages. I think a lot of adults are disconnected from how puberty actually felt due to the passage of time
Yes, yes it's bad
No hate, I just think that it’s funny that you keep comparing big mouth to family guy and big mouth is one of my favorite shows and I absolutely hate the humor in family guy😂
Recently got to learn about this show and  now i have cancer
I like it
14:45 I mean.......I used to always try my best to respect my teachers but I cursed one out during my bloody mary week 😂 never underestimate how fast a teenage girl can go from 0-100 when her body is still getting used to the changes of womanhood! Especially if you add on being in pain and having your emotions heightened
I can't care about story if character designs makes me wanna bleach my eyes. Couldn't last a single episode, easily ugliest people I saw in fiction
Big mouth is an absolute masterpiece
Yes
i hope that AS does buy inside job
Bigmouths funny
I didn’t get past 3 minutes of the first episode. 😳👀
I was fairly upset with Inside Job getting cancelled, but how did I fecking miss that Dead End was also cancelled. That irritates me so much, because it's the first time I've seen a chubby, trans guy lead with blue hair, in a show that I liked. As a chubby, trans guy who has had their hair blue, many times, it was kinda neat. Ahwell. Can't get too attached to Netflix 'originals', I guess is the story. I'll have to read the books now.
Big Mouerth.
I think people hate big mouth because it’s kinda like a teen show like I know not one adult that likes big mouth maybe that’s just what I think
No wonder you got cheated on
why are you pronouncing the "ow" sound wrong
my boyfriend likes it so i can't complain about it too much
Dude, I cannot be the only one that is repulsed by seeing young kids and teens animated talking about and being part of sexual situations. Adults are thinking about and animating that shit, it's discusting. Probably watched by all the people who are okay with Herbert saying pedo shit
ngl i have watched this ass show but i skipped the abortion episode because its cringe that they basically say that all the smart characters are pro and the dumb ones are pro life its just cringe
Big mouth isnt “great” but I wouldn’t say it’s awful either. I enjoyed my time watching it
woah they have big lips I wOndEr wHy ItS NoT lIkE THe ShOW Is caLled BiG MouTh
The first couple seasons were pretty well written and I was digging the character growth of Andrew and Nick. Now though the show has lost its luster and all the borderline cp just makes me uncomfortable.
It’s not a amazing series but I’m disappointing with you with this one as only 8 mins in and things you are comparing about is explained and other things you are overdoing it. Only the kids at he the time can see the misters the joke of that one been able to see someone else’s is because he’s on the spectrum usually smarter and sees through things that’s the joke then.  I really can’t watch anymore it really is someone who hasn’t watched the whole show and is now making presumptions and comparing about it ?
I always forget how sort of intense the show was in the beginning. Honestly I think you really took the show seriously in some parts where attention should be focused elsewhere. While puberty was the big part of the Early seasons.   It started tackling more divisive topics. Like gender, sexuality, and race. It handles this topics in an interesting way. But I will not hold it against some folks not being onboard with the humor of the show.
yes, even worse, yw
The fact that I had to question whether or not I even watched season 5 just shows how forgettable it is. Just started season 6 and I have mixed emotions.
Netflix renews it because of nepotism. The creators of the show and Netflix's leadership aren't direct family, but they share a certain...common background that I won't get into in a YouTube comment section. Suffice to say, such nepotism has been at the core of Hollywood for a very, very long time.
I watched big mouth for a few seasons. It is alright I guess, but it definitely downgraded throughout them. I think personally that it is a show that wants to go too woke, kill itself by doing that while failing because of Netflix.
love the sonic rush music lol
nick kroll looks like an off brand jeff goldblum
kids grow up and leave you to die broken and alooone
Big Mouith
normally the "dont shit on people, they worked hard on this" is a good rule but i promise nobody is even trying with this one
I hated everything except for Andrews Dad and the Shame Wizard
Yes
in answer to the title.... yes
The big mouth monsters being seen is kind of like people understanding stewie for family guy sometimes you see and hear them sometimes you don't. Once the character does the ~DeVils TAngO~ the hormone monster leaves like with coach Steve and jays mom that is why jay does have a hormone monster. As a teen going through puperty (I can't spell) the show has taught me a lot of things my parents would feel uncomfortable talking about I relate to missy as black girl and my emotions to Jessie. In my opinion I love the show  mainly cause it has taught me a lot about how I feel and my body. I love Missy and Jay so much!!
Is it true your GF is cheating on you and you are ok with it?
You make a valid argument but I don't think anyone worked hard making big mouth except the korean kids at the netflix animation studios
Thank you for your input!!! Never want to watch this show myself :)
inbeweiners inbetweeners
My problem with big mouth now is that they’re running out of good jokes in my opinion, and the characters aren’t aging! I understand in the cartoon universe, characters don’t grow up. But given that the characters have changed grades (I think maybe once throughout the shows run so far), I was hoping they’d at least get to high school by the most recent season?!? They’ve been stuck in middle school since the show first came out in 2018. I was hoping as I aged that the characters would at least go up a grade class level as well?!! I was in 8th when it first premiered, now I’m a freshman in college and they have yet to change. It’s so boring now, and the show is really going downhill.
My brain is crying because I keep hearing “Big Marth” and I can’t un-hear it
the reason I personally dont like big mouth is that theres so much cp "but its the actors!! and THEIR story its to make it relatable" 1. that doesnt make cp acceptable 2. they can make it so much relatable so many other ways without SHOWING E V E R Y T H I N G. Yeah do that shit with like the adults but why actual 11-13 yr old kids... also the most recent seasons are just ehh......
I watched it and the first season was incredibly accurate. Netflix in general has been going downhill. I recently renewed and cancelled my subscription in the same month because there's hardly any shows available. There was absolutely nothing worth watching with my girlfriend.
Man this show looks U G L Y
this show makes me puke yet i watch the new season every time it comes out  EDIT: i'm  going through changes no more like i'm going insane
I thought you were going to make a joke when you said “you know what you should shove in your big mouth”
This was one of those shows that only the first season is good. All the other seasons were too much singing and drama bullshit.
I love the focus on some issues & inconsistencies, and I also forgot about the focus on a coming of age, and also how the show falls. I wanted to mention a few things.  1. Maury being seen by others is addressed, in one episode where Andrew's imaginary son talks to Maury. 2. It's also been showed that there's hormone monsters. 3. It's revealed that the characters feel these emotions & a monster of some kind comes over to be the manifestation of it, I believe that season 5 finale says.
Big mouth went woke and died.
99 vs 76 user score is not 200 across the board??
15:41 someone give me the song tho got damn
Huh I really like the animation of f is for family
When I first looked at Big Mouth, I was genuinely impressed that a show's artstyle could be uglier than The Wild Thornberrys
Why that monster look like that alien from american dad
The only reason big mouth is still going for more seasons, and others were canceled, is because the people funding it are rich and wanted to keep going so they’re gonna keep pushing money into it to keep it going
No offense but at 8:00 this video is already rife with misinformation and missing context about the lore of the show.
Show is dog shit
You know the reason I hate this type of shows like Big Mouth and Velma and stuff is because a bunch of crazy adults draw upon every teenager stereotype imaginable and shove it down our throats, I get mad because I'm right by the end of my own puberty and it isn't like I went around fucking everything, drinking and smoking every type of drug or bullying people or getting bullied Some of us only really study and deal with life as it comes, we aren't slaves to our hormones or social norms, and might I remind you that those teenagers that the media so love to criticize and show as stupid and dumb will be the ones soon doing operations, being judges, or making the next world blowing technological or scientifical achievement like those teens that figured how to biodegrade oil with bacteria back in 2017
23:36, no no guys, you see, this is what we call pinacle of voice acting. Sam Witwer screaming Kenobi doesn't compare to this 100% fully realistic scream, Markiplier sounds fake compared to this.
36:29 what is that sound name it sounds so good
I'm sorry, there's 6 seasons of this?
Sorry but big mouth is the best Netflix animates series. It's really good.  I think one thing to note as men when we compare it to South park and the like, it's not as perfect to us. But big mouth does cater to both genders. Me and my wife can watch it together and both laugh. South park leaves her a little alienated.
Big Mouth is failed potential, its a corpse being tied to a truck and dragged along the road. Big Mouth has gotten better in later seasons, but its such a massive hit and miss every episode. The most recent season introduced an asexual character. It tried, but failed miserably, as the meanings of Aromantic and Asexual became interloped, and it presents asexuality as just not wanting sex or any form of intimacy which included forms of sensual touch. This character also had the church plotline of practicing abstinence, which is an awful message to have intertwined with asexuality. Its incredibly disappointing, especially to myself and the asexual community, because it sends a very bad message. Another loss for Asexuals everywhere.  That being said, season 4 is the peak of the show. Its why I started watching Big Mouth again. I really enjoyed the Missy storyline, and the tackling of a Transgender character I thought was done well, being said I am neither black, biracial nor trans, so my words on their representation should be taken with a grain of salt. I have stopped paying attention to Netflix's antics. I heard Inside Job was cancelled, and just recently heard Dead End Paranormal Park was cancelled, which is really sad because they are both great shows. I watched season 1 of big mouth when it came out and dropped it, I really didn't like, it made me uncomfortable. I can't speak much on the writing, its fine but nothing life changing, the art style is ugly and the characters are absolutely its biggest weakness, another case of all the characters are super obnoxious and unlikeable. They prioritise making jokes and the awful 4th wall breaking humour, that the characters arc's and personality fall flat, so they all come off as just a bunch of assholes.  When making a show about kids, you need to consider the age in mind. In big mouth they are a bunch of self aware 30yr olds posing as 13yr olds, on top of making a show about puberty and what it is like to go through puberty. But the show is so sexualised and again, focusing on humour rather than the subject matter, which had lead to a confusing target demographic. The show isn't made for that age group, when it really should be. Puberty is embarrassing and awkward and it sucks, but appealing to an adult audience by making fun of it isn't as good of a premise. The Hormone Monster too is such an awesome idea but falls flat. Its a show where every good idea and point completely misses the mark, and ruins what could have been great. As others have said in the comments, Big Mouth is a show that keeps getting chances to show that potential, where other shows that have already displayed that potential and proven itself.
I love Big Mouth
I like big mouth
It's bad and if you watch it you're gay and stupid.
Big Mouth is not the worst show ever but I would never call it a great show. It is mediocre.
big maurth
Wait Andrew isn't the main character?
"Andrew wondering if he might be gehhh" I'm sorry bro I love you lmao
"yes, it is" *Clicks off video*
meh i like to watch it when i’m high
4:02 Almost Famous is so fucking good
I found myself enjoying the first 2-3 seasons but now I can't stand it I don't know if it's because my imature 13 year old self just liked the idea of kids a similar age to me takaling something I was also going through at the time but now I'm almost 18 I can see how terrible the show is
As someone who has unwillingly seen this show twice while smoking weed with friends there are characters that are so unfunny to me in this show was a waste of time and drugs. There were interesting plot points occasionally but just made me physically recoil into my torso like a turtle for 90% of the experience.
This show is about the sexual lives of children. It’s bad.
yes
🎉
god forbid the show called "big mouth" have characters with big mouths
I love the og tekken music
Big mourth
yes by far this show is just overrated and boring netflix did right only with bojak horseman and disenchantment
The biggest reason big mouth is hated is the animated child pornography. No need for a one hour video
Icl I do enjoy big mouth
dont watch you normally but your accent is fucking with my brain, the way you say the word "mouth" is shocking.
IS THAT TEKKEN DARK RESURRECTION MUSIC I HEAR??
When are you gonna reward yourself and watch every episode of Futurama?
I'm actually a Big Mouth enjoyer and I have to hide it like a guilty pleasure 😭 it's just fun to me
I just realized this was posted on my birthday lol
One thing I will say is that I acted EXACTLY, and I mean EXACTLY like Jesse, when I was going through puberty, so seeing her going through the motions, no clear goal or anything was a big comfort
short answer: yes
While the show has a lot of faults, it's always felt sort of comforting to me, being a teenager going through everything the characters are it feels really relatable. Again I feel there is a lot of problems and I understand the hate, but this show being around in such a weird part of life is just really nice to have. Sorry if I worded any of this weirdly lmao
This show taught me more about puberty than school ever did 😂
How OLD are these "kids"?
I love how big mouth talks about things that are awkward.
I do like big mouth because we can all relate too.
I feel like you entirely missed the whole point of the show
Why do you say gay like Chris chan
Yes, yes it is.
The most important thing i learned is after seeing its creators face, nick kroll. I can see why all the characters look like that
MARK HAS ARMS???
Its the best thing to happen to sex ed, it cutes the BS and shows the truly ugly side of puberty, get passed the few jokes that dont land, its not that bad.
27:37 song?
indise job is canceled? noooooooo
Why be a cuck though?
i just... disagree. you're wrong. every problem you point out isnt a problem, its a feature. shut up
I thought this video was about Big Mouth but it sounds like you're talking about Big Marth.  Which is it?
Short answer is yes. It's just a weird pedophilic groomer made show.  Only degenerates like it  Not to mention not one joke is funny.
No it’s bad.
"However"-"Highedver"
If you're looking for a show that tackles adolescence without shying away from the grossness and cringe, but stays compassionate to its characters and faithful to its own internal logic while being hilarious and often surreal -- that show is PEN15. It's wildly underrated. Watching this video essay made me reflect on how PEN15 did right what Big Mouth was trying to do.
I think lots of points you made weren’t fully researched, for example human resources is the place where lots of extra terrestrial things exist by hr is where the hormone monsters work. While they have multiple kids not all of them. Another thing is they are real but more of an extension of them, more so as that there choices are their own but it’s like their inner voice talking. Lastly, the thing about no one calling them out for seeing them is that only the child they are with can see them, the reason caleb saw him is because they were making a joke about caleb being “special”.
puberty for 6 seasons.. off
It’s alright
All my homies hate big mouth, fuck big mouth
yes it is
Did they even cancel the epic tales of captain underpants too
See I figured only 1 kid can see the hormone monster at a time Like if Maury is with Andrew, then only Andrew can see him, but if Maury goes to be with Nick for example, then only nick can see him  Also the same hormone monster seems to have slightly different personality traits depending on the kid they are with so I think the monsters are still real, but they mentally change depending on who they're with and adopt that kids personality traits during the time they're with them
The new artstyle of the mark persona drawings is kinda worse than before-
I've liked the show since day 1. Just hated the human designs lol. Though the spinoff show Human Resources might actually be even better than Big outh
I think that list plot was literally verbatim stolen from south park 31:39
I didn't even know people think it's bad. I love it. I crack up hard everytime. Most of the stuff being cancelled wasn't even on my radar. Edit: the more of this video I watch the more I realize the hate is coming from morons who don't understand how the Big Mouth universe works. And don't understand what a joke is.
Dude I love big mouth ideas one of the most funniest shows that ever came out in my whole entire life but I feel that the only thing that holds it back is when the show characters become too self-aware of the factor in a show or they do 4th wall breaking jokes that I feel is the lowest the lowest form of Comedy you can use for jokes it just doesn't work I understand a lot of people can make the argument will Family Guy does it well yeah they used to do it in a way where they had the Cutaway Jokes which I understand could be a form of 4th wall breaking but it's really not it's more like the characters thought on the idea of that one time they went into a celebrity or something random just happened in their life while the idea of the 4th wall breaking joke gives the character too much power and awareness of the idea that they're in a show and I think when that happens to that formal comedy it just ruins everything because I feel it's the fastest way to make people lose interest because then the characters are going to constantly make jokes that aren't needed for the idea of needing to be there I feel like comedy should be a thing that comes at its own will throughout the scenes of you're doing a show that's supposed to be funny and not needing to rely on the reality show this is a TV show where on maybe that's just me but I always feel like the 4th wall breaking jokes are the only thing that always ruin a show
Imagine a show advertising the exact paid streaming service that it's exclusive to, and that anyone has to pay for to even watch it....
Dirk Gently, Bebop, Daredevil, Disjointed, The Witcher etc etc. But hey, atleast there´s a nother season of "my kids like to fuck too" edit: The cancellation of bebop was a godsend, it´s just a shame they didn´t even try going the oldschool route and instead just shit everything down
I think the big issue with the show is that it never clarifies who the audience is. Is it adults? Then why do the writers feel adults want close up shots of preteen genitalia? There’s nothing funny about it. If it’s for teenagers, surely there should be more care and sensitivity, more character development than almost any episode is capable of delivering. In my mind it’s the same issues as euphoria.
The first two seasons were decently funny but yeah I definitely stopped caring about it
So pretty much people hate it because it got a new show and the other shows they like didn't/got cancelled. These kids be crying about everything
Big mouth is a pedo show That show was disgusting.
Kroll having a billionaire for a parent definitely has nothing to do with the fact this show is still going
Sorry to hear about your relationship man. Hope she is more faithful
I appreciate the Ace rep from the show, and hear it was pretty good, but the best damn representation in the world could not get me past the visual and comedic style. Good to know I'm not missing too much.
25:28 im literally high right now lmao
I don't know if you have or not, but you should really watch The Nick Kroll Show. I thought it was a terrible show - so be warned, but you can see the origins/influences for some of the characters in Big Mouth
Always found it odd when a voice actor gets replaced because of their race. I get it with stage/live actors as they have a physical onscreen presence so having the actors be right race for the role is important, but VAs don't have a physical presence. They just have to sound right, which means if a white dude can sound right, it's fine and the reverse is true. I don't remember anyone complaining Samurai Jack, a Japanese character, is voiced by Phil LeMarr, a black actor. Similarly Kratos in the rebooted God of War games isn't voiced by a Greek, he is voiced by Christopher Judge who is definitely not Greek. Both these examples are fine because their performances are excellent and highlight the greatest strength of voice acting as a profession: anyone can do it as long as they sound right for the part. Does the industry need more actors of colour? Yeah, absolutely. But that doesn't mean the talent you already have should be thrown out of the production because they weren't born with the right skin that the audience won't see anyway.
Big Mouth could literally be top tier in writing, but I'd never know because it is ugly as sin and I damage my eyes enough.
I just hate the art style and CANNOT get past it. I'm honestly not sure which I hate more: this or Cal Arts Style
29:09 It was released months before the rest of the season
cosmos door
8:00 because they appear whenever they want. and the hormone monsters can choose who sees them. they forget about their monsters when they lost them. Caleb is special, he can see everything because hes stupid
It's very weird. I like this show. It's funny and smart, but ugly and gross.
Human Resources is a better show imo, even tho its just The Office and Big Mouth combined its still a good show. I work in an office and holy shit some of that shit in the show actually goes on.  Regarding season 1 and not having anyone acknowledge Maury or Rick, only the person they're assigned too can see them, Caleb is... different, he's Lord Infinite dont question it.  As Nick Kroll said in season 5, its all in their heads, its not actually a monster its just how they're perceiving their emotions and hormonal changes from puberty..
Your accent 😭
“That ends with him jacking off to the corpse of his grandfather” WHAT? WTF, holy sh*t I had to rewind 3 times to make sure i heard that right, how did this show get made, who made this show, that isn’t even dark its just like one of the most sickest things I’ve ever heard was in media….
Yes. There saved an hour of your time.
Nick krolls dad is a billionaire
I saw like a season or 2 and kind of dropped out. I just think I got bored of it.
I'm still mad at them canceling the Wings of Fire series...
I actually think Human Resources is WAY better! It focuses on the monsters and their job and adult clients. Like The office kinda spoof. They have covered postpartum addiction death mental illness  and it's less gross. Some of the episodes are really deep. It's almost hard to watch Big Mouth cause I'd rather watch HR.
Not only does this show make no sense, it physically hurts my eyes to look at. I have no idea how this garbage gets renewed on Netflix. My family shares streaming services so we all don't have to pay for them individually, so when I lose Netflix, I won't mind until Arcane season 2 comes out. I'll wait until it's all out, then buy it for a month to watch that and then cancel it again. Let's hope they don't cancel that one too.
It’s less that the show is totally horrible, so much as SO MANY other shows are more deserving of not being cancelled but they still get the axe.
lul.. big moth
I love big mouth
I will never understand the obsession with sexualizing children
The pillows are stupid and not funny
big mouth strikes again
Would be better without the hormone monster imo
Don't hate watch it either.
How is it netflix can slay at depression and anxiety driven characters, with comedy tones in bojack and absolutely fail at everything in big mouth.
i am so sorry you had to watch that
oh, yes, big marth. we love a good 61 episodes of big mart. my favourite episode of big mike is the one in florida or LA or whatever
I like it. It's stupid but that's fine, I don't wanna always watch the next Casablanca or whatever when I'm just trying to relax. All these shows and movies people love to hate on, I feel like they're expecting too much from. I get there's better made adult cartoons and raunchy films but that's not the point imo, it's nice to have a variety of things that are considered gross out entertainment. Big mouth is the type of show I'll watch first while actually paying attention and laughing occasionally when the joke lands. After, it's something I can put on if I'm gonna multitask or might fall asleep. Even on a rewatch, occasionally something still is just so absurd that I can't help but laugh at the stupidity of it! Is it gonna be looked back at as the best, most intelligent adult cartoon ever made? No. It's just a raunchy cartoon that covers a really relatable topic. I was definitely Jay, my friend even introduced me to the show because that soup and pillow stuff immediately made her think of something I'd have done as a teen lol. Never did but it's not a stretch, I had no clue how to deal with that period of life so I basically just ran around trying to have some fun with anyone I could until my early 20s. Mixed with zero ability to feel shame or embarrassment and maybe a bit of ADHD, I feel sorry for a lot of people who had to deal with me and cringe looking back at a lot of the things I did...
I... love Big Mouth. I think it's funny as fuck, and very much steeped in nonduality; the hormone creatures exist and at the same time do not. Anything is allowed to happen at any time, AND there is a continuous coming-of-age-type story being told. I can understand your frustration but I simply don't struggle with it myself. I guess I'm one of the lucky ones.
it’s not bad, it’s not good, it’s FINE.
INBETWEENERS YES
woah his guy changed
Wait inside job got cancelled and big mouth didn’t I haven’t watched this whole video yet but I watched some of big mouth and that got another season
"Is big mouth REALLY that bad?"  Rotten Tomatoes: 100% positive  IDK, I think it's very good, and I think that is the majority view in fact...
Yes.
I like big mouth for what it is, a low effort comedy where the theme is about puberty. Don't expect Avatar LAB levels of care.
Yes it is...  And it's the worst
I just can't get behind something so.... Ugly. Like it's putrid. It's so unappealing to look at, that I will fully believe that this show absolutely sucks, and y'know what? I'll be right. Ugliness can be cool, but theres a threshold that should never be passed. I argue that when you make something THIS ugly, it just stops being art. It's just garbage. And I wholeheartedly believe that.
This is why you don't make a deliberately off putting or cruddy art style. I genuinely wonder how people would feel about this show if it never fell into the uncanny valley of lips in animation.
I don't think the writing is the problem so much as the borderline sexualization of children. When you consider that these are all adults, and a lot of older adults, cresting the show it becomes honestly slightly pedophilic. I'm a big fan of coming of age stories myself, and puberty is a difficult topic to depict because of its sensitive nature. I actually like the show Pen15 quite a lot because while it's a comedy, it also shows very seriously how children can easily be taken advantage of and the messed up things that can happen among kids. Big Mouth was so brash and abrasive. The comedy is not my style at all, and I can forgive that, but I can't forgive how the sexual aspect of the show is framed
The amount of random R’s in words makes me think you’re Australian.
Ngl ur taking this to serious it’s just something for entertainment doesn’t matter if it makes a lot of sense or not
Netflix removing their best shows only to give Big Mouth another season:
Nah I don't give a shit we've seen "big dumb puberty metaphor" but this is just that without any subtlety. Not to mention the fact I don't know 1 person who has a positive opinion of it but I can name so many people who ooze over cancelled Netflix shows. Netflix is probably botting their views for big mouth to justify spending money on a failure of a show.
Yes. The Disclosure episode not-so-subtly implies that men who are sexually assaulted (like Terry Crews) don't exist, and that if they do and it was by a woman (like how Katy Perry's assaulted multiple people), they should just be happy she's reclaiming her sexuality and that speaking up would be oppressing her
I really enjoy Big Mouth. It's not any less awkward to look at than like South Park for example, I think most characters are likeable (Missy, Matt, Jessie,...) and at times very relatable. Many forget how absolutely gross, confusing and terrifying puberty can be. But all in all its just a silly little show and I'm always looking forward to the next season.
I never watched it, but seeing it getting more and more seasons I seriously thought there is something going on that justifies its existence. Like smart storytelling on par with Bojack Horseman.  No it doesn't. Its mediocre at best. And the sexual depiction of children only makes more uncomfortable.  Thanks LSMark. I don't need to watch it anymore.
The older I get, the more it seems that violence and sex is all adult animation is.  I think a majority of adult animation actually targets children and young teens. Big Mouth being a coming of age story doesn't actually appeal to adults, because adults typically don't enjoy seeing children in awkward and sexual situations, but for children and teens in the same age range, it's hilarious and edgy.
I canceled Netflix Over this show, i was too afraid that my kid whatches this woke crap
I really like Human Resources I really think they should focus more on that
Tbh one of the reasons I don’t like it that much is the way they execute some of the s*xual topics is just plain gross and makes me extremely uncomfortable. Like I feel you can animate  this in a way that isn’t gross to look at, and I honestly think if there wasn’t so much grotesque animations then I probably would enjoy the show a lot more. And I feel like a lot of shows think that by adding this type of thing it will get more watchers bc we’re not used to it, but in reality that doesn’t make for a good well rounded show and sometimes it just back fires and makes you not want to watch it.
I only watched the first two seasons but the first one was pretty funny, the second one was more of the same and it got more sentimental and preachy, not to mention the songs killed the flow and tone of every eposode they appeared in. However, i watched dubbed and it had excellent voice work done in it, better than the original as is usual in animation shows.
yes
Big mouth is good as fuck
Big marth..
Yes.
I watched one episode with my family. No words. It was horrible. Literally felt like it was a show for people with adhd. Not a second to breathe, constant yelling and random singing, made no sense and was just absolute dog shit overall
i’d love to see a video like this on velma
ahhhh, yes. Big moth.
i honestly love big mouth, but it’s just upsetting that other better animated shows get canceled and this one has so many seasons
Point #2: Your characters need to mature in some way… don’t tell the characters at It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia that 😅
Yes, next video
I can confirm, laser pointer cured my depression.
I don't love it, I don't hate it.  The show Big Mouth just isn't for me.
Theres no amount of "Dude this show isnt that bad" that could convince me theres anything appealing in the show.
WHAT ACcent IS THIS BRO
I’ll only ever watch big mouth for Judd.
it has some Cheese Pizza in it so yeah probably
The people who hate Big Mouth the most are the people who haven't watched Big Mouth.
once again yes
Big Marth
I Love big mouth😂
Honestly I genuinely do like Big Mouth I think the main plots with the kids are very well done and I like how the monsters are embodiments of their human feelings but ya I just wish someone else was writing the show. Personally I think it’s just Netflix going with whatever makes them quick money and what I’ve seen with a lot of streaming services where they just don’t see the potential in animation. In my personal opinion, Netflix should fund Human Resources more it’s a genuinely way better show because instead of focusing on JUST puberty it focuses on human life and it holds back on the comedy and actually shows what life is like in very sincere ways. The one short season it has resonated with me way more than Big Mouth did with its 6 seasons. But ya animation in general has been going to shit for such a long time it sucks. The only hope I have rn is that Netflix gets it shit together cus I don’t even care about the other services, Netflix just does everyone so dirty I hate it
Yes
quick and shorter answer: yes
How did I not know Inside Job was cancelled?! I thought it was safe for sure. Guess there’s no such thing as safe anymore with Netflix, unless you’re a teeny bopper show like Stranger Things or Wednesday.
I think the difference is that Big Mouth is clearly a show that doesn’t have much heart put into it, and does gross and sloppy things even for a show that’s supposed to be unfiltered. While a very thorough and high quality show like Inside Job is cancelled. I mean even if Big Mouth first season was good or not the fact that a show with naked children stayed longer than an extremely unique show like Inside Job, like what is reality at this point.
I love Matt’s character. He’s the only character I enjoy watching on this show
havent watched the video yet but Yes
Glad to see a more broad look at this, as I frankly refuse to watch it due to the horrid artstyle and showing graphic scenes of characters that are supposed to be children. Just creepy and disgusting. Them being "meta" about it makes it even worse. Watching this was interesting but also just cemented what I assumed about it, as if I needed more of a reason to never watch it lol.  Also I kinda disagree with your stance on shows being cancelled. I think it's reasonable to feel upset that certain shows people really like get cancelled early on, but others get to go on for 6+ seasons. It's pretty obvious why people would want Big Mouth cancelled... even if just from a moral standpoint.
Id like to personally explain. The hormone monster isnt real Its inside each childs head. So no one see’s the others monsters Alsoo CALEB being the only person to see maury Is hilarious, because Hes clearly on the spectrum (like meee) lmfao  The only kid that can see them is the autistic one😂 I feel you caleb😂
This was horrible to see during my adolescence
no. its awesome
This show is ped0 in nature and is disgusting. Repent from your sins and believe in Jesus Christ, who is Lord. Tomorrow is not promised, and Jesus is coming back John 3:  16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. 17 For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.  18 “He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. 19 And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. 20 For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. 21 But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God.”
I saw a couple episodes and I HATED HATED HATED it. Yes it is that bad. And I like raunchy adult cartoons like South Park. This Big Mouth show on par with Brickleberry 🤢 I really hate the way the characters look like gross dead fish.
I told my friend recently that they made 7 seasons and are still adding not only rhat got a second show and he thinks it ended not at all 💀
the autistic kid seeing everyone's monster didn't bother me and oddly made sense comedy-wise. he's autistic (or neuro divergent) meaning he sees the world differently so why shuldn't he see maurice and the other monsters?
I’m not extremely religious or a snowflake. I do consider myself both a spiritual and tolerant person but even I think this show is overly hyper sexualised and only truly speaks to a very specific audience that was raised by media and the internet.
i was a sophomore when Big Mouth came out & going through a really hard time. i felt completely alone & like no one could understand me. when i saw jessi going through her depression, i felt seen. going into this show, i knew it would be exaggerated and not actually how puberty would be. i think your review was really put together but i wish you could have watched it through a 16 year old’s eyes. the show is bad but very comforting & makes me laugh
big mouth taught me many things that I needed to know in my teens.   Many things could change... But it has a lot of good things too
Wasn't camp camp similar to big mouth? I'm talking about the humor and such, I don't know much bout both of the shows but I've seen a few clips, all I'm saying is that camp camp made me laugh more then big mouth
Am I the only one that recognizes the dragon ball music at the end?
The point of the depression kitty shrinking is because Jesse is distracted from it, thus her feelings of sadness and loneliness are less than. Still there but less.
Bruh who gives a shit! If missy is voiced by a white woman the character herself is still black! I liked her voice the way it was! Not the new voice it sounds off! They need to bring back the right actress! You want black representation than have a black actor in a movie not a cartoon! All I’m saying is story wise they didn’t have to do that cuz she’s a cartoon character! Not the little mermaid from the new movie, not that that was good representation anyways, cuz it’s Disney and they don’t care about that thing anymore! It’s just brownie points to them!
INSIDE JOB WAS CANCELLED WTF????
what is big marth? what is this guy saying?
Maybe later in the future we won't have Netflix anymore
I'm over twenty and I don't even know what people mean by PUBERTY. It seems such an abstract concept to me, I can't list a single interesting event from my life that would specifically fit this category. This term just seems so overexaggerated to me
I remember watching the first season in middle and now being in college I’m just baffled how long it’s lasted
i think the big mouth spinoff was okay i guess, handled some topics well..and the songs were alright
What I don't like about this show is that Nick Krulls' character is the only one getting humiliated to a certain degree and Andrew gets to have some popularity when that Andrew kid most likely got called out for stuff like that in real life. These characters act like suburban children from the 90s. And suburban children from the 90s were little melvin dorks. Now, I don't know if you remember a slang term like that thrown around, but that's what we called the creepy little leonards and sheldons in their dorky-ass beta group that thought they were so profound. I'm astonished nobody has to deal with an actual bullying situation in Big Mouth. And no I am not talking about that Milk boy at camp bullshit. Nobody in Big Mouth actually has to stand up for themselves and sweep the leg .
As someone who weirdly enjoys Big Mouth (I have very bad taste in shows)... I can say confidently that I HATED the pillow scene, it made me so uncomfortable to the point that I had to skip it every time it came up
Are you Irish or Canadian?! What the fuck is your accent?!
Honestly, it doesn't get better than season 4, they did an excellent job with handling their characters emotionally with such satisfying payoffs. I cried a few times.
27:36 You do have a girlfriend, so....
I'll never forgive them for cancelling the oa
I'll be honest I love this show. Idc about how much hate it gets lol
The whole switching bodies episode in season 6 is definitely a pop-culture reference to the movie Freaky Friday starting Lindsey Lohan.
Hearing fucking Tekken music in the background makes me fucking laugh my ass off.
I always really liked how the hormone monsters were just so awful. They were what made the show in the earlier seasons.
I love big mouth
No. It's much worse.
big miyth
Yes, it is.
11:02 11:43 13:40
I'm baffled that anyone could find big mouth funny tbh. My girlfriend's friend and sister like it, so I tried to give it a go while they were watching a few episodes. Just ended up bored.
I thoroughly enjoyed the first two seasons but after that it just got weird..
I discovered today people don't like big mouth, i actually love the show, there are moments when i definetly felt unconfortable with some scenes, but it's something family guy does too, but without a social commentary and relatable situation. I don't get really what people hate so much on this cartoon
Bigmouth isn't a bad show, perfect? No. But bad? Also no.
I simply don’t like the show because it’s ugly
big marth
Honestly i hate the writing but i think i hate the Art style way more. I genuinely despise how everyones mouth and eyes look in this show
the only good characters in the whole show with an actual arc from season 1 to 6 was anderws parents
Can someone tell me that song that plays at 28:40? That shit slaps
Big morrrrrrth
9:39 Holy shit minion
As someone who likes big mouth, I had a talk with one of my teachers who also likes it, he said that it reminds him of his childhood and how he disliked going through puberty, but now he can laugh at it.  I like it because of the monster that get introduced and how the kids get to affected by it
I’m not gonna lie I don’t have the hatred of this show but same time I don’t like either try to become like another Family Guy or Simpsons or American dad show I’ve seen as adults but releases for teenagers who think that cussing and swearing are funny and then click on me you know overall the show is not good for me and the sky sake that this will get more seasons then other great shows that people like this crap that’s my personal opinion about the show
yeah
It hit 666k views🤣
I like the show but it is vile and disgusting. I can’t imagine what it teaches kids. I know 6 year olds that watch this show
i understand why the entire woman centered episode would be disgusting, honestly it made me uncomfortable but as a woman who rarely had talks about that kind of stuff, its nice to see it normalized. theres rare moments where i enjoy the topic but at the same time, its big mouth. im uncomfortable by the jokes while also stuck watching every season.
big mouth wants to be south park so bad
A better example of “but *blah blah blah insert dumb show* is getting another season?” would be Chicago party aunt. Can’t believe that fucking dumpster fire got another season, absolutely fuckin diabolical.
46:42 wtf was that vocal take?
the pan character made me annoyed too. mostly cuz'  im pan and I didnt like the representation but whatever
Big Mouth is good
5:02 uh oh. I saw the pillussy
I feel like I’m losing more and more brain cells as the show continues
I still like big mouth 🤧
I don't believe that big mouth is that bad, I've not watched it but, I do think it has overstayed it's welcome. Btw why 6 seasons is a bet insane. Edit: I don't really like the show, but I think people are mostly just venting. If you laughed at the word "venting" there's something wrong with you.
It's not bad but some of the jokes and songs do miss their mark sometimes
sighs & shrugs*** *“to each their own”* lmaoo 💁🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️💀
I think it’s fine if people like it, I don’t let the internets opinion become mine I find out about it for myself and I really didn’t care for this one as much as I love shows like this I don’t want to sit here and watch a kid jerk off though I like the jokes about it in family guy and many other shows
Because of Jews
I guess Big Mouth marketing wanted this show to take off by word of mouth lol
Ihe
Look I don't give a s#@t how many people talk smack bout Big mouth or me for liking it but Big mouth is HILARIOUS!! Most of the people who talk smack on it either never saw it n just want to smack on something or never gave it a shot. I  didn't like it at first but I gave it chance n I'm glad I did cause with all the stupid bulls#@t going on in America rite now I need something that makes me laugh my ass off!!
I really don’t understand the complaint about Hormone Monsters having inconsistent rules because you keep referring to a clip where Caleb sees Maury but Caleb is consistently joked about throughout the series as being sort of omniscient which is why he’s the only one who sees it outside of like human resources
Big mouth is so funny tho. It’s up there for sure
I luv big mouth
this show just stinks I'll be completely honest
Big marth isnt a very good show
I mean out side of a few joke the hormone monster is a metaphor, it’s like imaginary friends, the kid’s psychology the brain creates a way to cope with problems in they’re life, puberty is completely new, and the monster is an internal thought rather than an actual physical being monster isn’t actually real, it’s the suppressed emotions!
How found mory, Andrew and jay the most relatable!😂👌
Dude I fucking love big mouth!
My take on the whole thing is  Don’t like it not for me but I did hate on it till inside job got canceled cause the funding really would have better spent on inside job
tl:dr: yes
Missy is Bi Racial. So if the show truly wants representation then shouldn't her character be voiced by a Bi Racial VA? Someone who's went through the same struggle of discovering both sides of their heritage.
I always feel weird admitting i like this show because people who have never seen it might make some assumptions based on the little bit they know about the show that i dont want people to associate with me.
I want inside job back bro
Hell no big mouth is the best
I saw season 1 of big mouth and then I stopped watching ot
I have never loved big mouth I just appreciate it showing relatable things I went through in middle school. Oddly enough Jay was somewhat relatable for me in the way of him struggling with his sexuality and learning to embrace it and be happy with it. Also somewhat with Missy and being hormonal and mixed. The struggle of embracing your culture and who you are is REAL but I'm just sad they did so little with it.  I have also enjoyed when they every now and then be educational because ngl growing up no one really told me about a lot so I was just in the dark about a lot of subjects. Even season 6 helped me realize what a yeast infection can look like and how important pubic hair is! I legitimately didn't know this shxt I kid you not. So it helped me realize I needed to see a doctor and that I should really stop shaving as often XD I don't like a lot about Big Mouth and usually it leaves me weirdly looking at the writers but I've been watching this show since middle school and it's helped me every now and then with stuff I still have trouble with. I would say I recommend the show Sex Ed more though because it does a much better job with a lot of these subjects I'm just sad the wait for seasons is so long.
yes
I used to stay away with Big mouth because of the way ppl talked abt it. Love it not and can’t wait for the next season!
TLDR: yes
for me watching the show its like watching nothing to watch on netflix. It just meh.
The best guess I have for why they do this is that they tried predicting that people would try posting Big Mouth moments similar to family guy, so they decided to sprinkle Netflix advertisements here and there, otherwise I'm as lost as you are (23:14 for context)
dude youre a cuck
As someone who genuinely likes the show even though I kind of dropped off after season 4, Im surprised at how much hate the show gets.  I understand why people might not like BM (even I'm not a fan of the art style and all the meta humor) but the character interactions are enjoyable, most of the jokes are entertaining, and there's effort put into the show.  Basically people treat the show like it's a 0/10 but it's a solid 6/10.
more like totally not mark with that ending music
I'm not gunna lie, the biggest sin is that we didn't get a full cover of Changes by Maya Rudolph. It's 100% the best part of the show.
My friend and I have watched most of it, it's pretty funny and probably better for kids these days than newer seasons of family guy are and the new cartoon network garbage
as someone who liked the show, the pillow thing was gross.
I watched the first four seasons and I generally liked it. I admit I watched it out of morbid curiosity because that first trailer was so bad, but it ended up being a lot better than expected. It can be crude, some scenes can be unconformable and push boundaries too far, and I'm not a fan of the art style. However, I can overlook this because the characters are likeable and relatable, the exploration of puberty can be frank and it gets the emotional moments right. I like that Andrew is a good kid in the first season but the Hormone Monster acts like the devil on his shoulder, I like Jessie's battle with depression, and I really like it when the monsters are amping up what the characters are feeling. It's also good to see a show that explores female puberty as well as male puberty.
I watched that it has s - e - x
yes. yes it is.
Where are you from? Why do you say “mouth” like that?
I thought this video would be interesting because I'm a HUGE fan of Big Mouth but your looking to deep into it. Just enjoy the jokes and stop reading into it so much. I'm also a fan of the spin off.  There both full of imagination.
The joke with Caleb being able to see the monster was supposed to be a play on autism giving him increased perception.
I think the shows actually pretty relatable and a lot of the stuff the characters went through, I also went through. The show can be pretty funny at times and the supernatural stuff is ok to me, it just adds a bit more drama. I really liked season 6 and thought it was the best one yet. The season finale with body switching seemed great to me because it let the characters see (besides missy) that their relatives aren't terrible and they actually care about eachother. Also, you got a few plot points grossly wrong, like the Jay and Matthew one. Matthew still wanted to be with Jay, but he felt that he changed Jay too much and felt Jay would be better off.   Though, to be fair, I do think all the...graphic stuff with the children is pretty gross and unnecessary. Im a man, but from lots of female viewers ive heard the "womans private part" episode was very relatable, but obviously I can't speak on that.
People keep debating which show is worse. Big Mouth or Velma. That’s easy, Velma is worse. While Big Mouth may be disgusting, freaking scarring, and very uncomfortable to watch, Big Mouth is unique. The creators started from scratch when making it. They invented the whole Big Mouth universe, and released it to the public to see what people thought about it. And oddly enough, it became very successful. Velma is worse because the writers are in no way creative, and they have no balls. Instead of inventing a show, and gaining a dedicated audience over time, they decided to sponge off of Scooby-Doo’s audience because they knew that nobody would watch if they created their own characters.
yes
So having a white chick voice a black character is a no no but watching an underaged character mess around with her vagina is alright? Gross.
I have no opinion on this show, as I’m just a mindless Netflix watcher who will quite literally watch anything.
People don't like things they're watching getting cancelled? Ooooh, so weird, buncha hypocrites they are
I cant watch even one Episode of this Show its just gross boring with  a lot of Sex Jokes and not even good ones
No way the ibai meme is universal i consider this a win for Hispanic people. I'm taking about the fat guy explaining
Personally never got past just seeing the initial netflix trailer they pushed I can't cope with the art style just not up my alley
i jus like watching shit where i can turn my brain off and giggle at obscene shit
The show only needed two seasons about puberty that's it after that it just became gross and unnecessary starting to feel like there's some pedos in the the Netflix work office
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me Tell me where did you sleep last night In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine I would shiver the whole night through  My girl, my girl, where will you go? I'm going where the cold wind blows In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine I would shiver the whole night through  Her husband was a hard working man Just about a mile from here His head was found in a driving wheel But his body never was found  My girl, my girl, don't lie to me Tell me where did you sleep last night In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine I would shiver the whole night through (Shiver for me)  My girl, my girl, where will you go? I'm going where the cold wind blows In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine I would shiver the whole night through  My girl, my girl, don't lie to me Tell me where did you sleep last night In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine I would shiver the whole night through  My girl, my girl, where will you go? I'm going where the cold wind blows In the pines, the pines the sun don't shine I'd shiver... the whole night through
the reason this show gets new seasons is because the person who makes it is backed by a billionaire, hes just a rich brat with daddies money who knows nothing about puberty
Damn this videos presentation is amazing, your line work is crisp
Imo 1, 2 and 4 were my best to watch
I literally cannot tell what your accent is it keeps changing I’m so contused
Ok I enjoy the channel but why when I go into my YouTube notifications did it say it was an important notification? When did that become a thing?
watch this get demonetized tomorrow
yes, yes it is.
Inside job getting canceled really hit me man I loved that show
Mark increasingly becoming obsessed with Plok music.
Seeing Mark in the Big Mouth artstyle is a nightmare
My friends and I were looking for a show to kill time and a couple of them wanted to throw Big Mouth on. Nobody was laughing, everyone hated it, and we turned it off barely halfway through the episode. I probably would have been less harsh on it if I was watching it alone, but in a group… Jfc it was so cringey.
Tekken music
this is like if the family guy cast can here stewie
I have a sugestion on Netflix there's a show called ,,bad exorcis" I would like to know what do you think about it
I personally love the show, yes its a lil out there alot, but theres some rlly nice watchable moments
as a big mouth fan (except season 6) i hated the pillow thing
Big Mouth is meh at least in my opinion. The problem is better things get less seasons and cancelled. That's why there's much hate for it
So on the love bug thing. I think the love bugs are supposed to symbolize romantic love and i feel that andrew really only had sexual feelings for missy
yes
I for one like Big Mouth. I shouldn't have to hate one show to be able to understand the nuance of another. Inside Job Is times better than Big Mouth, bit I like the show. I didn't like the Arc of Nick/Missy being a dick to everyone In S5, but nonetheless find the show to be enjoyable
Tbf a ton of people keep saying they didn’t relate to it but honestly going through puberty for me was exactly like Jessie’s experience and it honestly shocked me how much I was like her
ah yes "big muarth" the show about teens with big 'muarths' a hormone monster
I do enjoy Big Mouth. It isn't really the best, and can see your points. In my mind it is closer to the humor that was shortly after Family Guy's funnier seasons. Again, not saying much.  But I enjoy watching it at least.  I do like Human Recourses better though.
IIRC the animation is so ugly because they were hoping it would discourage people from making porn of the characters.  It probably didn’t work.
The show feels like a family guy cutaway gag that became a show
Beeg Moth
It's literally cp
this show is just animated child *ornography
I'm still waiting for you to say mouth correctly
IM LITERALLY SCREAMING DEAD END PARANORMAL PARK. OVER BIG MOUTH?? BRO BIG MOUTH HAS TOO MANY SEASONS BROO AND NETFLIX JUST GONNA CANCEL DEAD END LIKE THAT BRUH DEAD END ONLY HAS 2 SEASONS BIG MOUTH HAS 6 BRO   *My Opinion*
This video is just you plagiarizing ihe
Not a fan of this video. Not only does it feel like major nitpicking, but the way you've censored it with the sudden loud noise makes me jump every time, it's really unpleasant.   Also, can you REALLY not say words like "sex" and "masturbate" on YouTube anymore?
My biggest issue is when you make crude humor, it either needs to be funny, or relatable. 90% of these jokes are neither. They’re crude just because they can be and aren’t funny at all and the situations are all hyper perverse and exaggerated to the point that no sane person can relate to them
Its worse.
I relate heavy to Big Mouth. I went from Nick in 2017 to a beautiful swan turned party wolf in 2023
Omg it's so easy, only the kids the monster interact with at that moment can see them, Caleb is weird Maury because he's the only one that can see him other than Andre at that moment. The show starts with Andrew in class and Maury walks in to make him do the deed, do you really think the teacher wouldn't say anything?  And adults forget about them as time passes by
dId you heat on your wife
I loved big mouth 😂
I was indifferent to the story of this show at the start, I didn't really get the coming of age story part.  But what really put my off was the good awful animation style. I like all sorts of animation styles and I love seeing new stuff get shown off, but this show? It inches into uncanny valley territory that I have trouble even gleaning emotion from, let alone understand and empathize. It's so plastic and low detail that it just radiates a disingenuous aura about it that makes the whole "this is a coming of age story but also ha ha funny joke" even more evident  It's so hard to glean any sort of intention from this show. It's like they took people with a story to tell and gave them a chance, but only if that story was told through a template of shitty adult animated comedy made to get ratings.
I watched Human Resourses and can atest, it is better than Big Mouth, and is really good when it focuses in the human experience, but then in the lasts few episodes there's a very dumb plot about a storm that kind of ruins the rest of the season for me.
Big mouth inherently will die though.   South park and family guy can stand still in time pretty much forever. The point of big mouth is that growing up part, they can only use that for so long.
Kinda annoying when youtubers whine about muh YouTube policies. Just like go somewhere else or something. YouTube will never get better while everyone is just like "oh I hate that they do this but not enough to do anything about it... Oh well."
Nice background music. Sonic Rush?
You like Juno?
at 45:19 turn on subtitles and watch them, ls mark I'm dissapointed in you
I like Bad Mouth because I was precisely a couple of these characters growing up and I was sooooo... so lost. And the Hormone monster channels PRECISELY the things I'd think and then immediately go "WTF brain!" Meanwhile all shows about teens my age were completely sterilized of any attempt at tackling sex whatsoever, making me feel like a freak that should be ashamed to be in society.  And don't worry about the people working on the Velma show. Literally, the ONLY criticism that's not being flung at it is about the animation, which is often the only thing praised by anyone talking about the show. The animators are fine. The writers on the other hand...
No it's not. The sex is more puberty and urges than it is actual sex. They build on the legacy of Fuzzy and Fluffy Bunny from The Simpsons. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OCBP2AOSjc
Just watch diary of a wimpy kid (not long haul)
Shouldn't most of the show be classified as cp
I feel like big mouth is a show that most people don't like because it's about children but I feel a lot of people around the age of these characters like it
Boys being visited by boy hormone monsters and Vive versa isn't really true it's implied that they like certain monsters with guys and certain monsters with girls
Bro I'm a strong believer in you shouldn't crap on something because people worked hard on it well not exactly it's fine to crap and criticise as long as you recognize the work put in to it which is why I feel really bad for shows where the writers and animators get bleeped on a lot such as Velma, Big Mouth, helluva Boss, miraculous.
As someone who has been watching the show since 2019 I can safely say that ive enjoyed it less and less with every season. Like, i remember watching it shortly after season 3 and I liked it (sadly I don’t have huge standards for humor) I thought, while it wasn’t the best show, or maybe even a good show, it was at least fun. Then I watched season 4, and I liked it, but also not as much as the first three. Then I watched s5 and considering the fact I was very excited for this season, it let me down a lot. I started to feel empty watching it, I mean it was fine, but the pacing felt weird and unsatisfactory but I hoped maybe s6 will be an improvement. As it turned out, this was an even bigger letdown. I was super disappointed. It feels like the show has lost its soul in a way, and honestly I’m not excited for season 7 anymore, because I know I’ll be disappointed so what’s the point? I don’t know if it’s me getting older or the show getting worse but it feels way worse than it was during the first 3 seasons
I thought it was funny but I am 15
I feel so attacked by the weed comment 😭😂 watching this whilst toasted, slowly eating tomatoes because I have no actual munch 😅😅
About the rules on seeing the monsters, I always kind of assumed that they were selectively invisible and could only be seen by who they want to be. They, especially Maury, but also the Monstress, are kind of like an embodiment of chaos and they push everyone to do different things and feel different ways. I also think the reason everyone has one of only a few monsters is for practicality. It already has a pretty big cast of characters and it would be an absolutely massive cast if every character had their own original monster to keep track of and remember who went with who. They've added new ones as the series went on but its still just a handful. Having ambiguous rules for the fantasy makes it easier to follow the action without complicating things with 5 different characters all filling the same role and saying the same kinds of things but invisible to each other.
I just can't stand the art style and will never be able to make it through an episode.
I like Big Mouth... I don't think its a perfect 100 like Rotten Tomatoes does, but I'd agree with the overall audience score. Mid to late 70s, early 80s. That sounds about right for Big Mouth. I do hope they wrap it up within the next season or so. I think the quality is beginning to dip ever so slightly.  I also think F is for Family could've gone another season or two, but It is better it ended early on a high note.
your accent intrigues me. i like how you say "mouth" different every time.
Wtf is big marf
Ive just started watching big mouth and its not too bad, ive definitely seen worse
"this series is making us too much money and is too popular. Let's cancel it"
Dead End was canceled? Fuck! I loved it so much! It had an autistic main character; you don't see that often!
TLDW; yeah, it's fuckign trash
in bigmouth the hormone monsters can only be seen by the client theyre working with at the time. When Connie was working with Nick and Jessie during a fight she had to keep switching between the two in order to speak with them. Also its revealed in a later season when Nick meets Nick Kroll, Nick Kroll reveals that everything i made up in the characters head. (Correct me if im wrong its been a fat minute since i've seen the show) so this could explain a lot of continuity errors/weird rule set of what can and cannot happen
Okay, after 15 minutes I know: Yeah, it REALLY is that bad. Won't waste any more time on the analysis of a show where I find even short portions so annoyingly bad that I want throw feces at the screen.   Greetings from Germany :)
I hate big mouth I will put down Netflix like a dog if they keep putting up more seasons
i hate the way you say mouth it’s pissing me off so bad
i hate the way you say mouth it’s pissing me off so bad
I remember watching this show when it first came out and the only thing I remember about it is that it looked super gross and one of the background characters looked like an undertale character
Its not bad lmao people are just easily swayed. I guarantee after this video big mouths metrics will go up even higher.
The art style is hideous, not for me thanks
In my honest opinion I don’t think big mouth is as bad as people say it is, I really don’t like the gross out stuff and I think it often goes too far especially considering the fact that the characters are middle schoolers. I feel like the gross out stuff and the fact that the characters are so young and  portrayed in uncomfortable situations is enough for someone to not like it at all, however I do think the show has some good moments and not all the characters are completely insufferable. I feel like the show can  oddly provide some good representation and it actually covers some serious topics in very good ways. I thought the show was particularly good at portraying being transgender, asexuality, and even stuff like break ups and learning how to set boundaries. Of course there’s a lot of insufferable characters on top of that, which kind of pushes the good messages to the wayside but it’s one of those shows that I can’t really look away from and at least get a tiny bit of enjoyment from. However I definitely don’t think the show needs any more seasons or as many as it has gotten. Shows like dead end and inside job definitely needed way more than this lukewarm show.
Wait, people actually hate this show? All I've ever heard were positive things.
I think you missed the point of the Netflix is awesome jokes they are the classic adult animation joke of "praise be to the corporate overlords" at least that was what I personally thought they were going for
im pretty sure the gag with kaleb seeing maury is the fact that nobody else can see him besides andrew, not sure tho! awesome video, super detailed and good commetary!!
Calleb can see maury because he's autistic/aspurgers
It got unwatchable after season 3. It peaked with the valentines day episode.
I honestly dont get the hate. Sometimes im not sure if its not TOO relatable for some people. There are annoying parts-like the old hormone monster and the gym teacher. It feels like very dumb slapstick.  But the coming of Age story? The conflicts? I found it relatable. I mean its not a documentary. And i still dont see the problem with the metaphoric existence of the hormone monsters... An talking about ugly animation with that avatar.Man i dont know if its that good of an idea. Its no Bojack Horseman all in all but no Brickleberry also.
I’ll Be Your Friend! 👍🏽
I will save you 56mins of your life - YES its shit
You should rank every episode of archer
If the Hormone Monster was just a metaphor, they could have made his intentions for "complicating things" knowing that he's in a TV show, so he wants to start drama. Making their host randomly aggressive, or horny, or causing awkward situations, etc.
Yeah thats 🧢 big mouth is a great show and the haters are most likely,  undercover fans of the show
Yeah I'm still going to hate it and wish it would get cancelled every time I see it.
I've never seen this show,  but judging by the plot synopsis, my confusion about Big Mouth actually mores stems from the fact that it's a show. Every fiber of my being is telling me this show should be a handful of movies at most, not a full on animated series. Mind you, that's just because I feel like this premise, at least to me, seems like it would work better as a film.
29:58 They stole that joke from "I hate Everything" :0
This show borders between avrage zombie simpsons seasons and that cartoon that Patrick watched in Spongebob (yeah, a guy get hit by the coconut). Not only it wastes it's own potential with those dumb "familly guy style".... gags if you call them that, but also kills other shows on platform. That's why people hate it.
33:32 hello everyone my name is markiplier
Yes, yes it is REALLY that bad.
This is crazy, I had no idea people hated this show. I absolutely love it, and to me it is one of the best animations out today, mainly because it doesn't limit itself. It's one of the "freer" shows I've ever seen, because it goes as further as possible with the characters and the plot and that feels weirdly liberating for the audience somehow which I believe is exactly what they intended.
Big maurth
Hello, could you list the music you use in your videos? I can recognize most songs, but not all.
In short. Yes, yes it bloody well is, and worse.
Big mouth is kinda just a shirt episodic version of inside out
It makes me feel weird as a man to watch the show. It's more for preteens going threw the weird struggles that are in the show.
What is this accent? As an American, I love foreign accents, but this one is awful. It hurts my ears
I like Big mouth but I don't love it. There are some good concepts and sometimes it's executed quite well. But there's too many characters with too many stories lines, the characters don't interact with each other much anymore, and honestly it's too vulgar. Like way to vulgar, they use it as a punch line more than an educational point.
F is for family? Really? That is the worst looking animated show to you? And this is right behind it?  Atleast the characters are tolerable to look at. Like saying king of the hill has the worst animation while south park is right behind it, you just can't compare the two. I'll just assume that wasn't a well thought out opinion.
I think Mark missed the point if the criticism towards Big Mouth regarding the animators. Lots of people online don't phrase it well, but the point isn't that they want the animators who work on big mouth out of a job BECAUSE they don't like the show, it's that they still WANT the animators to have work, but on something with the quality of The Venture Bros, or Smiling Friends. Plus, a lot of people just don't like seeing youngling parts, and that's a fair reason to be upset with the show.
this show is literally a visual representation of what puberty felt like. I think this is one of the most creative sows out there. I don't know why people hate it so much
At least big mouth is watchable unlike Velma 💀
i was the same age as the characters when they show started so i’ve always liked the show. i’m 19 now and still laugh at it, and can find comfort in some characters knowing that what i went through was normal. People irl love that show
Big Mouth is for "normies". It treads that fine line of being ugly enough to appear unique but relatable and crude enough that people with less expectations from cartoons to enjoy. The people who enjoy this show don't usually watch cartoons, they want, enjoy and search for this kind of content- it being delivered as a cartoon is part of a novelty. For the rest of us we see the potential of the concept and become annoyed it doesn't world build more consistently
I think you saying this is not a good show for kids or “how would kids be able to relate this” it is correct but that’s  not who the show is intended for no hate but you began so say this was for kids in the first season but then later switched it up and began saying it was for adults doesn’t make sense but to each their own and it isn’t your cup of tea and that’s okay ❤😂
i have never seen big maith? is it good?
I (in my shoes) have never really felt like big mouth was that off from how me and my friends were. We were advanced so we felt like mini adults and a majority of us understood some of the jokes being thrown (emotional intimacy) due to trauma and childhood problems. I sometimes forget that children with norm placement act VERY differently.
META humour and family guy art style is META so people do it for money Just look at the people who made Paradise PD!
35:52 I dont think teenagers should watch this. And in fact if any parent lets their teenager watch this id say they are a bad parent.
I love big mouth :(
I liked the first 2 seasons but everything after that is just a little too much half the time. But I’m not gonna lie I’ll still watch the new season unless it’s really bad
If you want a good awkward middle school drama just watch pen15
anyone know the bg music in 42:10
This show gets more disgusted reactions from me than humourous reactions. Not that gross can't be funny, but this show is gross for the sake of being gross. Just because an animation is "lazy" or "ugly" doesn't mean it's bad. Both still images and actual animation are pretty awful.
No, it's worse.
They made me in this show
Actually I changed my mind, it's worse than you think.
I don't like the show because it's pedophilic
"When you hear that idea you're like "what the hell, that's perfect!""  no, no im not lmao
Why does this mf say mouth so weird
Anyone who likes this show needs to be on a watch list
Andrew didn’t get a love bug for missy cause he wasn’t in love it was lust
ong i dropped my xbox controller when you played the sonic rush ost because I have not heard that sound in 12 years
Honestly, I kinda enjoyed big mouth. I started watching the show around 8th grade with a friend which helped me relate to the show more, espcially with characters like Jessie and missy. OFC there was some weird "should I reallyy watch this?" moments like jay with the pillows, turkey, etc or Andrew and his everlasting love for incest. Plus the lack of detail the show went with when showing Jessie and Ali. There were some "Big mouth isnt that bad" episodes The lola 3 dads episode was not amazing, but I liked seeing her grow into respecting and loving her moms patrol officer, and the episode with Jessies yeast infection was unique but very helpful incase a situation similar ever happens to me. Alot of people might disagree with me, but I honestly like some of Jays characters displayal. He grew up with a family and didn't love or care about him, which resulted in him not knowing how to love matthew properly and gripping onto his "concept" of love which is stealing matthews personality and habits. I do agree with the idea that they're not friends, I feel like the show puts andrew, nick, jessie, missy together whenever it fits the episode instead of teenagers hanging out. I also question the amount of adults looking at cartoon-style kid gentalia for entertainment but I feel like this is an OK show for someone going through puberty to watch and possibly relate to. (Espcially the p^rn addict episode some of the people my age are freaky like that) This comment is kinda random, but to explain the horomone monster seeing thing, basically how it works is you only see the monster if you also have a monster. That's why sometimes the volume the monster makes/what the monster does to others doesn't matter The reason that kid in S1 saw him is because big mouth wanted a "haha special education kid weird and see monster" joke. I don't really understand how only the main characters are able to have monsters since there's obvious tells that other characters are going thru puberty. ONE last thing, nick's character sucks, coach steve is annoying, and that horomone monster thats a replica of steve is also disgusting.
yes
I can write a book about what's wrong with this show, but in short it's fucking disguasting
I love big mouth ....🤷🏽‍♂️
The show is mid to me, Ive seen the first few seasons and really got nothing out of it but was a good way to kill some time. I definitely recommend watching it high
I personally loved it since the first season
Okay but the four fingers joke was actually really funny. The rest of this shows makes me wildly uncomfortable.
43:58 what's the song
There’s a lot wrong with the synopsis, but the main thing I came here to say is that the laser pointer represents the distraction from your depression because you won’t get out of depression by focusing on it you need to be distracted
Call me strange but I LOVE the show!
Big mouth is hilarious, I don’t mind the artstyle, I just- why do they have to sexualize the kids? Why do we need graphic drawn out pictures of Jesse and missys boobs and andrews dick? Like adults had to sit there and draw frame by frame child pornography. No matter what you say to justify it, it’s still pornography. It’s still drawn pictures of children predicted in sexual scenes. It doesn’t matter if they’re animated. It wouldn’t matter if they were real kids because it’s still children in sexual situations. That’s the end of my Ted talk thanks for coming
I feel like the idea of Big Mouth could’ve been great if it wasn’t made by Netflix but I don’t know if something similar could be made in the future because it would automatically be put down because of Big mouth so I don’t know    Like there’s still potential but it may never be met
wow this show sounds like a worse bojack Horsman
Im a sucker for musicals and crude puberty relatable humour so... I absolutely love this show (not even joking)
Why did you say today like that? 3:30
Yo, the new avatar is looking NEAT
god im sorry, it was no where NEAR as bad as i thought it was. Its way worse
Nick Kroll loves Nick Kroll like Kanye loves Kanye.
Big Marth?!  Why do u say it like that? You pronounce all other words correctly!
04:00 Submarine is so damn underrated, great film
The Pillow sex jokes are still there in season 6.
No way Inside Job got cancelled before Big Mouth.
No way Inside Job was cancelled before Big Mouth.
I can only think of one funny scene from the whole show. The scene with the dog that's aware of himself. I watched the first two seasons when they first came out and thought it was pretty stupid.
i feel like the hormone monsters were supposed to be somewhat in the kid's heads as a metaphor for how alien your thoughts can feel during puberty, but the longevity of the show has kind of forced them to develop character and lore which made them more literal which,, doesnt really help tbh
Holy shit I just realized you look super similar to this youtuber named Seamus O'Doherty who was a part of the creatures. You put a lot of emphasis on the sarcasm too.
Idk all the criticism he gave didn’t really come up for me when I watched this show….I love this show. It’s not serious and it’s dumb and I like that. Like family guy lol
This show is great and entertaining. Gross at points but still pretty well put together. The hate in unwarranted unless you're mad some shitty show got cancelled after one season while this one thrived.
yes.
Yes it’s that bad the art work makes me want to jump off a building
The first like two season when I was in high school  were fun but after that I lost all interest
I like the show. Just cause better ones sadly get cancelled doesnt make this worse.
Your speech is like Sean Harris's from The king... kind of off putting...
Honestly, overall, the show has shining moments and some moments which probably should have been reigned in. It feels like the show always goes 2 steps forward than 1 step back. So... but the potential overall is THERE just not always capitalised on.
the botched pansexuality definition in season 2 is like a time capsule back to 2012. somehow they managed to offend bisexuals, trans people, AND pansexuals all in one fell swoop. fascinating.
so ic adventure 2 art
Coach Steve is what you get if you take Coach McGuirk and remove every character trait that makes him sympathetic or endearing in any way, and then also have him played by any actor who isn't named H. Jon Benjamin.
Puberty is like for some odd reason a VASTLY underused premise for comedy and this show dies full on in
I've smoked weed about 15 times over the years. About 10 of those times I had visual hallucinations. Edibles was a mistake. My gf turned into a bird monster and when she fell asleep I thought she had died. I just have a low tolerance and well knew it when trying an edible skittle from a pot shop, and was in my late 20s and 250 pounds. So I assume a small teenager could trip out worse.
Honestly feel like you're hella over thinking here
23:27 tf is this, an ad?
I personally find Big Mouth hilarious for the most part. I love the over the top humor.
Okay, as someone who did think that was Will Arnett voiced the Hormone Monster, that joke about Nick Kroll voicing him was pretty solid.
10:23 Notice the voice crack at the end
The show is nothing more than a line in the shockingly long list of Netflix originals that are made by and for pee pees who like club penguin.
which season were they shifting art styles? that's probably the only one worth looking at.
I couldn't get through all of the terrible liberal propaganda. But that's everything on Netflix these days
I honestly think that people are way too mean when criticizing media. And no, I don’t mean when they give valid criticisms that make sense, I mean when they get way too angry and worked up over mediocre writing. I understand getting angry over shows that are genuinely offensive or problematic, but a lot of the time I see this happen with shows that made the unfortunate mistake of not being a Godsend Shakespearean masterpiece. Instead of focusing on the positives of the show and discussing how disheartening it is that the show ended up having so many issues, people just automatically jump to calling it garbage. It’s rude to the people that did genuinely try to make good writing, but that’s not my main issue with it, seeing as writers should be prepared for backlash when making something this public. I think the real problem this creates is that it makes a hate bandwagon. It happened with Velma because people must have just gotten really angry from how obnoxious the titular main character is and the subsequent ranting made complaining about the show a trend. It’s a really unnecessary train of hate that’s super annoying and/or disheartening to fans of whatever show is under scrutiny. It’s also annoying to me even when I’m not a fan of the show because people getting irrationally angry over things like this tends to rub off on me and make me angry too. So moral of the story is, I guess: people really like spreading hate and complaining online. Surprise, surprise.
I gasped when you showed your face. You’re fine as fuck my guy.
Big mouth is not really that bad at all because it's a little bit like family guy but just with alot of south park and rick & morty in the mix of the series but the show is pretty good for some people who watch it :]
It just occurred to me that making the characters as ugly as humanly possible might be an excuse to put everything on screen they wanted. I mean... think about how the season 2 Finale would have come off if the literal children had good character designs... or maybe I am giving them WAY too much credit... after all, these are the people who let the season 2 Finale happen
Final Space got cancelled and this still exists 😡
I thought Netflix was doing so good this year in 2023 beacause of the series called wednesday and that series was so popular like every enjoyed it so much :]
Yes
this show tries to be educational on lgbt stuff while still leaning into homophobic or weird fetishy tropes. I think it’s badly handled. They should have just written about what they knew imo…
Big Mouth is amazing!!
This is just a way to have a big mouth ranking, isn’t it Mark🤪
yes, next question
also why dont you understand that the bit with caleb seeing the monster is cuz that dude is like special lol he is not a normal kid
you lost me when you started talking shit about F is for Family's art
It's good to fall asleep to. Like so inoffensive to my ears and eyes as well as being not interesting enough to make me want to finish it during every watch that it's perfect for end of the night binging. I do the same with family guy and Bob's burgers.
heh i love the way he says big mouth
If Big Mouth ever ended, Netflix would probably make a spectacle out of it and cap it off on a high note while looking very sore it did end. You know a company has issues when they clearly pick favorites.
I  defense of Nick Roll he has worked on animation before
I’m just here to say big mouth is for p3d0philes
lol u got cheated on
Your censorship is disgusting. Blocked
I'm so pissed about dead end. Season 2 was way better than 1 and it was so comforting for me to see a plus size trans man as not only a hero but being portrayed as desirable
Kinda shocked about the whole just stop mark situation
7:49 Based on how Mori has a tendency toward self aggrandization, I don’t think the story about him being birthed by an alien was real. Also, we only see the main four’s hormone monsters bc those are the characters we follow. Just bc you don’t see them on other characters, doesn’t mean they’re not there.
Yeah it's a bad show tbh Imao
Probably a great video, but I’m here from just stop’s video to read drama comments
Big “Marrrrgth”
i hate watch it tbh
I find it odd that this is even a conversation. The show is pretty good. It's really funny a lot of the time and has some educational moments mixed in with actually decent portrayals of emotional states like depression and anxiety. Some of the later seasons leaned too much on the gross-out humor for me, but for the most part I feel like people are too quick to judge the show.
Even if it’s good or bad those shows did not deserve to get canceled while big mouth (which most people dislike) gets a pass
Idk man, I was exposed to this during middle school by a gf at the time. It was awful to me and I felt like she make took things from the show and made the relationship toxic
also i love the new art
big mouth mentioning bojack makes me want you to make an all bojack episode ranked video, in the same vein as the spongebob, simpsons and family guy ranking. that would be pretty cool for u to do
Big maurth
I will watching big mouth back in 97 on AOL!
always took the ugly artstyle as kinda intentional or at least beneficial for what show is. The show is about underaged characters going through the all the sexual, gross and embarassing part of puberty, you dont want that to be pretty and appealing
I never watched Big Mouth because the art style is unappealing to me(If you've seen my art you'd know why, but for reference my favorite shows are Rise of The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Love Live!) and the clips I saw on TikTok made me lose my mind.
can confirm my depression goes away with a laser pointer.
I don’t understand all the criticism it receives since I and most people I know who’ve watched it really enjoy it. The jokes are funny, and is surprisingly relatable considering all the goofy moments. The fact that it’s semi autobiographical makes me feel closer to the characters. I can understand why adults may not like it, but one watch will tell you that this was clearly not actually made for older audiences (more for ages 15-25)
It’s not that bad, As someone who used to be in middle school around there age level, This is pretty accurate to all of my experiences, Students are always looking for someone new to date and to do cool stuff with, Fights breaking out of nowhere for absolutely no reason, The weird kids who take stuff WAY too far.
Big Mouth is great, we're just in a cultural moment right now where conservative fearmongering about sexuality is higher than it has been in decades.   If fascism doesn't take over America by 2045, the same people who made all those tweets are going to be talking about how Big Mouth was revolutionary and a classic and they always loved it.
This show is made by perverts
yes
I really want to watch this video but looking at clips of this goddamn show makes my eyes bleed
I think Big Mouth is actually a pretty good show, it's just it is way out of pocket sometimes and I think some people can't stand that.
i love watching this show high 😊
personally, i love big mouth, big mouth has actually taught me a lot. big mouth is so hated cause its disgusting but i hope it gets more seasons even though its not liked around the world.
I think I would shoot myself if I was forced to watch this show because he art style makes me want to die
LS MARK AT 42:09 YOU DIDN'T CENSOR "JERKING OFF," CENSOR IT BEFORE YOU GET DEMONITIZED
Big mouth in my opinion is one of my favorite cartoons because of the relatability aspect being a 14 ur old in 8th grade
The only time I managed to laugh was the uncle grandpa clip
14:42 this is wrong. I’m a teen going through puberty. Ive done this maybe 47 or 48 I appreciate the vid. I’m 14 in middle school, and a LOT of big mouth is super relatable..  I think it’s all about the experience you had. I’m a popular, early developed female dog so that’s what makes me relate to Jessie and Gina.
I heard a theory once that Big Mouth is so ugly on purpose, because the writers wanted to make sure that people wouldn't masturbate to the show. I've considered the first episode (the only one I've actually finished) and reimagined it in the style of cartoons that are usually regarded as having high quality animation, and... the argument makes a lot of sense.
Big Mouth is a show for absent watching. It’s vulgar, stupid, and the humor is….sometimes funny. I don’t think this show is trying to be more than what it is, something to put on. The viewers watching it also enjoy it at face value. A crude show to watch at 2am while you’re stoned or drunk and just waiting to pass out.
I liked the show because alot of the characters were tested on the comedy bang bang podcast and they worked really well…the arts terrible, the writing is hit or miss, but i laughed my ass off at its crudeness
I enjoy the show with my sister and it's just a show we watch and shoot the shit about it. Make better jokes with our banter
I have a lot of issues with Big Mouth, but overall I personally really enjoy the show. As a person who works with kids, one of the parts I enjoy is looking at the main cast and being able to say "Oh, I know that kid". I get to laugh at the characrers because they seem like parodies of real people that I have met and had the responsibility of looking after. I also think that a lot of the controversy with the show simply stems from different senses of humor. I personally think coach steve and lola are the funniest parts of the show, whereas you think they're annoying. I think it is an interesting show to take a look at from all sorts of perspectives, and overall I agree with a lot of your critiques. <3
yellow dollar sign
My take: if the things Stewie does and says in Family Guy is OK then there's really nothing about this show that should be all that controversial
u should turn down the music a bit while you're talking
24:05 thanks doc
why do you sayit like big murt
I enjoyed it while I was in high school and it first came out, now I’m 19 and it just isn’t that funny anymore, admittedly though the spin off isn’t too bad
I LIKE BIG MOUTH
u need to do morel orel bro, definitely the best show ever from adult swim
Dude I'm not even gonna lie I thought Andrew was the protagonist
It's not that big mouth is the worse piece of media on earth its just compared to some of the amazing shows that have been cancelled with a lot of potential it's disappointing to see it comparatively not receive the same treatment. Like it's not the worst, but it's not brilliant. And it is unfair when plenty of shows haven't even had an opportunity to show all their colours
no. Big mouth is not bad.  ... Read more
I hear sonic rush music in the background
Did you just lie about Factor not being frozen while showing footage of you thawing it out in the microwave?
Big MARTH
My opinion on this is pretty much just-  I think it’s ugly as hell, I don’t care for the idea of a show about puberty, I’m not home watch it.
I liked it found it funny and some what educational and relatable
It's not that this show is "bad" per-say. In fact, a few people could argue that Big Mouth is actually pretty good (on a good day) and just okay (on a bad day). BUT this show PALES in comparison to Inside Job, Dead End Paranormal Park, Hilda, Owl House, etc etc
“You know what’s funny? The Big Bang Theory.” You shouldn’t have chosen that joke as not funny because it has me dying.
This is literally one of my top three favorite shows of all time tbh. I turn it on while I study and do other things too 🤣
I honestly love Big mouth. I thought the art style was cool, and the comedy (call me immature) really matched mine. Its been a comfort show of mine, and ive watched every season about four times by now.
Yes
Short answer: yes, yes it really was that awful
I watched the first 3-4 seasons when they came out, and while there were a lot of aspects I didn’t like, I didn’t hate it? I was actually kind of into it.  Haven’t been interested enough to watch the newer seasons though. Or it’s side show.
yeah i dont care i will admit it i am biased but this show makes me ill to just look at
For what it is i think its pretty good for at least the first four seasons. Theres such a overload of shitty adult animation these days and ive much rather watch all of big mouth than an episode of something like hoops, farzar or even new simpsons and family guy.
This is definitely one of those shows where you're just better off turning your brain off, bc then it would be very enjoyable. Like Dragonball Super. I do this and I actually find it very funny tbh
Honestly, while there are some tidbits that could be considered good, the bit that just bothers me the most is the fact that these characters which are clearly underage are being depicted doing adult behaviors. Yeah, underage kids are most likely doing these things, but it’s one thing for it to happen IRL, it’s another for it to be shown for the whole world to see. I dunno, it’s a problem I have with a lot of adult shows with underage characters; if you’re gonna show mature content, then maybe have adults instead of kids, cause… then it just comes off as perverse and gross, IMO.
I've been one of the defenders of this show since it premiered. Yes, it can be a bit uncomfortable at times, but that's puberty. And I don't think it's near the level of putrid as Paradise Police and Hoops. And while it's a shame that Inside Job and many other shows got cancelled, at least Big Mouth is thriving because it's genuinely fun and at times heart-warming
Yes. It is bad.
It's a shit show with awful amounts missed potential, and I refuse to budge on that. Animation fans get to be hypocrites if we are animators and recognize when something bastardizes an already heavily disrespected medium. Inside job deserved better. A lot of shows deserved better. I don't care if bigmouth is cancelled or not, I care that it lived while genuine care died
"all I see online is hatred towards the show, but it has a 99% on rotten tomatoes and is critical y acclaimed" yeah because us nerds that review cartoons so seriously and care about it that much are like 2% of the population. For the rest of the world it's a relatable show about the absurdness of being an awkward tweener in a world that doesn't talk about how your body is changing. I actually enjoyed the first season (nothing groundbreaking but it entertained me) and then I got bored. I can't understand how some people think it's a masterpiece. I also can't understand why so many people hate it so passionately. It's just a mid cartoon, go touch grass.
At this point, I only watch Big Mouth for the "Jewish Jokes"....
Okay but the depression kitty? It was so relatable I felt uncomfortable. But I agree, the way they got her away WAS bad.
No one likes change, yadayadayada, your new avatar has orangutang arms
I love this show
I love this show... Maybe I have poor taste? But I think it's very relatable
I think the frustration is that this show is still going somehow but inside job is being cancelled and bojack's ending was rushed out, both of which are much better examples of adult animation
"big möurth" dude is that an accent or a speech impediment cuz I'm trying to figure out wether to express anger or not cuz that's hella annoying
Yes
i would expect an active fanbase for a show that is six seasons long
I thought it was okay, not gonna lie. Mostly because of Missy, she's just like me I think (I don't..hump my stuffed animals..) I'm a biracial teen myself who mostly passes as black and i've had to deal with "acting whitewashed" or not really knowing who I am so i found some sense of comfort in her, also did anybody else just feel terribly bad for jay or is it just me 😭
Maury is the manifestation of the hormones, not a guide.  He is supposed to be the influence of raw immature desire.
honestly Shame Wizard's song is my favorite. Probably the only one I actually **enjoy** instead of just... tolerate.
47:56 oh i seen this before and i boldly flee out of that one Jokes aside i was preaty mutch 18 when this came out so i skiped, well that and it look fuck!ng ugly
I don't hate Big Mouth, but I'd rather have more Inside Job than Big Mouth
Big Mouth is kind of the epitome of all the problems with the adult animation industry for me, even if it's not the worst thing out there. There's this strange idea that anything with adults as the target audience has to be shocking, disgusting, and disturbing whenever possible. Maybe there's an idea that general audiences won't watch cartoons unless they have swearing and blood? But whatever the reasoning, I can't help but feel that a show with this concept, but showing way more restraint to the point that it would be appropriate for actual pubescent kids to watch, could be legitimately good.
This made me hate It even more, Its completely shit oh my fucking god i hope i live to see this show being canceled
I have a friend that refuses to watch Bojack Horseman but unironically enjoys Big Mouth... I fucking hate Big Mouth.
The hormone monster baby plotline in season 6 doesn't make much sense unless you've watched Human Resources beforehand, which makes sense chronologically. Outside of that specific plotline, Human Resources is pretty self-contained.
WAIT, Andrews not the main character?!
Short answer: Yes Long answer: Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
I love Mathew. He's the best character in the series.
It’s 50/50 I like it, some parts are funny, some scenes I think are really good cause it can be very educational and some scenes are questionable
This show is a pedophiles DREAM it baffles me that it’s even a thing….. meanwhile people literally are acting like Velma is so bad but this exist…
the show keeps getting renewed because it is immensely popular with younger groups. when i was like 14 and the show first aired, everyone else around me watched it and that continued to be the case until i was around like 17. my siblings are 14 now and they regularly watch the show. so i think it’ll always be popular because young teens are not really thinking about things like continuity errors and more just about the gross humor. also side note, i also lowkey prefer missy’s new voice actress, she’s now voiced by ayo edebiri from the bear!
My issue with this show is that I'm not a fucking pedophile
I'm sorry Mark but I can't stand this show will continue to hate and not watch this show any further than the first 3 episodes I watched and hearing my sister watching it from the other side of the room
35:00 - I do have to say, I really really hate when people go "sometimes people mean, but other times people no like mean!" Have you, perhaps, just a little bit, in some small way, considered the possibility that its 2 separate people?  Do some people not realize they have a hypocritical stance sometimes? Yes. Are a majority of people just out and out hypocrites with absolutely 0  self-awareness? No.  The reality this entire point you've made multiple times in this video about people being hypocrites is dumb. Its two separate groups of people. Calm down.  I also have to call out that you bring up the Rotten Tomatoes score a ton but uh...if you check the score through apps that "overwhelmingly positive" score comes from about 30 critics and 120 normal users. I shouldn't have to tell you that before the score got wiped, it was overwhelming negative with around 1000 reviews. Rotten Tomatoes over the last several years have completely wiped negative scores for shows if the companies have shelled out the money for it.
Hm deleting comments I see, or youtube is.
Nick Kroll Narcissist should be the title of whoever decides to do a deep dive into how fucking WEIRD this show is in the context of how much he clearly loves himself idk .
it is just a dump and gross show that i like to watch to not think and i have some laught from it, so yeah, it is nnot good at all, but it is not that bad
if i had to chose between this or bojack and inside job i say adios big mouth
At 43:38 thank you for the streets of rage music
I think it's important to have like media for teens about sexuality but this is like one of the worst ways to do it. Like I can't imagine this appealing to actual teens going through shit
:19Dead end paranormal park sucks I'm not going to miss that.
In concept, it works for something your teacher might show in Sex Ed. Never watched it personally because it looks like it just uses the concept for gross out humor.
Not even gonna watch the video, just gonna answer the title. yes, yes it is.
Why does it have to be so fucking ugly?
I definitely recommend watching human resources since its the best big mouth has been for this series, especially the penultimate episode.
Haven’t finished the video yet but I’m really digging the new channel art! I love the sharper and bolder lines, and I think the poses are a lot stronger.
My auto-generated captions keep interpreting "big mouth" as "big muff," and it's making me snicker every time.
This was a really roundabout way to say 'yes.'
The new pfp is amazing and I love the new pfp but itll take some getting used to
You forgot AMERICAN Dad . So good
Yes
it took a minute but im digging the new character stills and stuff.. still kinda miss the one before this though… RIP
I really like the last shot of the intro as well. Something about it with the music cue is so comforting
Yes
I don't know how I feel about hearing my name so many times
The answer is no, big mouth is not bad I mean, is no masterpiece, ans if I had to choose between Big Mouth and some other show, I would choose the other show (human resources are better anyway) but people crap too much on big mouth and it is unfair I get it, shows were canceled. Inside job was canceled. Is not the fault of Big Mouth, the creators and the problem aren't them either. Don't focus your anger on a innocent by stander just to because it still exists  Besides, so many awful shows are still on Netflix and you all choose the pick on the decent one? F off
New character artstyle, since when
I watched the first 3 seasons and I heard when season 4 was coming out and I could not bear it. I watched it just to have a conversation piece and be like "this show is not good lol"
The scene with Nick meeting Nick Kroll is so fucking dystopian. It perfectly encapsulates everything wrong with not only the show, but modern adult animation as a whole. It's perfectly poetic in a way.
idc about big mouth. But man. I can't believe Just Stop leaked your relationship history on YouTube lolol
Hey mark I just wanted to take some time out of my day to thank you man you save us a lot of time watching new shows and re watching shows to give some critics and a voice to some new opinions I don’t even want to imagine how long you sit watching this stuff  but we do appreciate it and will continue to watch
Let's all take a moment to think about how Big Mouth's Showrunner is the voice of Professor Pee-Pee Diarrheastein Poopypants Esquire from the Captain Underpants Movie.  Good job in the movie, but also shows what type of stuff he usually works on.
Wait wait wait wait LS MARK actually needs Almost Famous, yo I got all my respect for this dude now.
the slenderman joke is funny but i dont know if it's for the reason they thought it is? Or maybe that was intended? idk man im confused
The first season was funny but everything else is ass maybe I just need to give it another watch
Big Maurth
i hate the show but im trapped in a cycle of watching it and i hate it so much
Just Stop fans Rise
Did u watch just stops video?
This video gets an instant like for using Nina Williams Tekken 2 music!
Wtf...? Big Mouth was hilarious.
Yes.
See big mouth I feel like it’s one of those shows you watch just cause it’s kinda good but wanna see what they talk about each season so you watch it once. I mean the show I like I just only watch the season once and then move on. Like I love how it talked about some topics about being gay, home issues, and all that I like how it sparks a conversation
She's cheating on you.
new character design is so much better
That ending gave me totallynotmark vibes and I’m chilling with it
Going to be completely honest, I cannot get past the show's artstyle, it is fucking hideous. Thing is it's not like it's an issue I regularly have, I can watch South Park or ATHF perfectly fine. Big Mouth's artstyle though isn't just bad, I feel like it's almost purposely designed in a way to set off the revulsion centers in your brain. The only thing I can think of being worse is Problem Solverz, and that show looked so bad it was basically a cognitohazard.
When I was in middle school, I had pretty much no guidance or sense of comfort as I was raised in a conservative household. So when the show started and I watched it for the first time as an eighth grader, I felt like I could actually connect to what was going on. It didn't feel as if anyone else was going through any of that while I was, and it was a good source of entertainment for me. But as I got older, things made less sense and were less funny and MUCH more uncomfortable. At this point, it doesn't even feel like any of the struggles of the characters are real anymore. You can tell what the writers are trying to say, but it just doesn't work. It feels like random fluff just to keep the show going, and that sense of "yeah I went through this same thing" is gone. I can't connect with any of the characters anymore, and the season 6 finale was extremely disappointing. And there's so many annoying characters, such as the anxiety mosquitoes, coach Steve, and I have no clue what's going on with that baby hormone monster.  I'm glad that there's people out there who want to shine a light on the challenges middle schoolers go through during puberty. It may even help them feel less alone and more understood, like young me. But now the show is this big bundle of weird humor and unlikable characters. Like wtf is even going on with Andrew?? I think the show should've stopped much earlier (maybe after season 3 or 4) because now it feels like they're beating a dead horse when there's much better adult animation they could work on, like Inside Job!  I still watch Big Mouth, as it can be entertaining sometimes. Despite not being connected to anything about it anymore and being very confused about several things going on in the show, it's still watchable.  But that's just my opinion on the show, I agree with a lot of what you said in this video if not all of it! Thank you for covering this. :)
I've been watching the show since it came out n I honestly really like it. Watching a bunch of idiots running around dealing with the same stuff as me was comforting and made feel less alone.
This new artstyle is way too kiddy for a grown 20 something year old man. Guess I can't expect much from the cuck who marries the goblin who cheated on him. Sad.
For me personally, I just hate the character designs. There are alot og "ugly" cartoons I like, like Bob's Burgers or South Park for example. Not the most pleasant look but it works. For Big Mouth the character designs make me want to puke...the absolute worst style i've ever seen and I can't even fully explain why. There's just something REALLY offputting about how this show looks...
the real question is which one of the writers hooked up with their cousin
Are you ok? I saw just stops video on you and Veronica last night, somehow before it got deleted even though I never watched any of his videos before. I’ve been watching you since your video on sml, and I’m very worried for you.
I watched the first two seasons, couldn't get through the third. It's just painfully unfunny
27:39 what song is this?
The way you say "mouth" 🤣🤣
anyone liking bigmouth is a nonce clearly because of what this shit contains
imo big mouth never deserved critical analysis, feels like yet another cynically made adult animated sitcom that appeals to the lowest common denominator. subject matter is gross and weird, the creators don't even understand the genre they claim to represent. In addition to failing in art-style, effective story telling, character depth - it just isn't particularly funny. I would go as far as to say the show itself is a landmark that is a testament to the uncaring, uninspired viewer, who desires nothing more than shlocky, poorly made C-grade edgy cartoons. If this is anyone's favorite show I would simply suggest watching any other adult animated sitcom and I bet you'll think it's better so long as you don't think children's genitalia as a punchline isn't the pinnacle of comedy.
I enjoyed it. Yes, it's stupid and weird, but it's still entertaining.
Big Mouth is phenomenal
I never watched big mouth but I remember looking at an image of matt and saying "he looks like a twink" so I'm glad to be proven right about something
new pngs look clean
people will deny it but lots of these "adult" animated shows are made for children who have access to streaming services unrestricted. They know what they are doing, look at how immature 90% of them are.
🤗I 😍 a big mouth👀😳🤣
It was good
Mark's new design is the best thing that has happened to me so far this year
The new avatars are so cute, super expressive as well!
Yes
"It's critically acclaimed on Rotten Tomatoes" That has meant nothing for about a decade now
Did he switch between a  Scottish and American accent in the entire vid or am I imagining stuff
I learned just at this moment, watching this video, that my favourite show has been cancelled. Rip Dead End
I like the new, expressive Mark icons
Oh my this video going crazy let’s go 😭
Okay... Your entire intro section about the hormone monsters being inconsistent is so trivial. This isn't a problem whatsoever. The joke that was the autistic kid could see Maury... How could you miss that? Their rules and logic aren't supposed to be consistent, it is a comedic device. It's a freaking cartoon, nobody cares about the consistency of the hormone monster "rules" or "ecology". It's a metaphor until it's convenient for a joke and that's exactly how it should work.
The hardest thing I’ve ever had to do was fake laugh at this show for hours while watching it with friends
It's weirdly become an annual passive watch for me cause I usually binge it in an evening but I was....alarmed? At how much I enjoyed human resources and I think the shift to adults navigating emotions was way easier to watch and connect with than "modern" kids dealing with puberty. That's just me tho
When they took off all the power rangers I was hurt and big mouth isn't bad like the show knows what they are targeting as well as its spinoff human  resources at F is for family is excellent as well unlike other shows that's trying like Velma 🤢🤮🤮
6:35 i knew you would hring up fop, but tbf i thought the same thing
I wish you added more ytp stuff between segmented
All of these are literally just opinions, and that is fine until you start stating them as fact. Not liking someone doesn’t make it inherently bad. This video is bad based on that logic
Whoa, blast to the past with the Tekken 5 waterfall stage music coming out of nowhere for me.
Big Mouth IS a masterpiece. I don't care what anyone says. At my age, I've never seen a single piece of media in ANY FORMAT that covers these real perverse things that teens and pre-teens have to deal with in such an honest way. It makes some people uncomfortable and I'm completely okay with that, when you get over the "over the top" elements, you're left with something beautifully absurd, provocative, and honest to the human experience.
I’ve watched like 3 or 4 episodes of Big Mouth in the past… I understand what people have to say in defense of it, but that show is just revolting to me. I could barely stand looking at the character designs while watching this video lol
This is how I found out inside job was cancelled, and now I’m pretty sad. That show was alright
Yo mark, gotta say when you whipped out the ridge racer music i knew you were a real one
Big mouth is an indoctrination series. Simple.
Anyone else notice how he ended his video the way totallynotmark would
Hey, I work in the industry and wanna give you all some insight into what animation workers think because you're all very uninformed. Whenever a show gets canceled, almost no one turns around and says "oh but why does X show still get renewed". Why? because ANY show on the air means jobs. In an industry where studios seem to be hell-bent on axing every animated show, any potential landing spot for artists/ workers is good news. I'm sure some of the artists affected by the inside Job cancellation may very well find work on Big Mouth. I can see the frustration on the audience side, but if you truly want to see more animation it's important to support ALL animation for the sake of the workers, instead of just your personal favs. A rising tide lifts all boats.
I honestly thought Andrew was the main character until realizing the voice actors
I liked big mouth at first, but its gotten terrible now and borderline unwatchable
4:00
is it just me or does nick kroll look like a big mouth character himself
Im pretty sure they are a metaphor. But it has a lot of meta jokes.
they cant see the hormone monsters im pretty sure they say this, and im pretty sure caleb is just weird
yeah
What gets me more than anything is that they could have made it not weird and creepy with child characters and still used the premise and been so much better. It's such a loss in potential.
3:47 that tekken 5 music brings me back
I hope you're doing okay, Mark.
For real, the show is hilarious and the designs are alright.
Just found out insidejob cancelled not cool
I really like the new art for the videos
I think the mechanics of the Hormone Monsters are something that could be explained fairly easily, but they just never do, which is the stupid part
You're a barnie loving justin beiber listening homework doing baby! Dislike! DislikedZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Americans take it really serious that their voice actors fit the character's race while I'm sitting here in Germany where Peter Griffin and Will Smith share the same white voice actor.
… I just like Big Mouth cause it’s stupid and funny. I also kinda appreciate the pillow thing cause they made Jay a serious fucking pervert and I’d rather him be shown doing that shit on a pillow versus a classmate tbh. But highkey you have a lot of really good points and I fully agree that they take things a bit too far in what they’re willing to animate and show on child characters
The gowls at YouTube unsubscribed me
This video should've just been the word "yes"
I am more surprised they didn't just jump the shark yet... cause if they can't tell growing stories.. time to do something extreme... Make someone fall in love with one of their "monsters"  Wich could work in this show, becoming a form of narcasim or just chasing highs. Remember the hate snake? I AM SURPRISED the show didn't try to use them to hunt "hate" online. You know "Drama queens" and finding hate.  Yea I went there. But in reality... the show ain't that clever and will probably just make things awkward.  But.. considering a new season.. they might do that.
as someone who was in middle school when the show came out, it was really nice to see stuff i was going through that isn’t really talked about. it’s shitty yeah, but comforting
Lawn chair ✔️  Popcorn ✔️   Okay comment section, do your work.
the show started off fine with the first 2 seasons. and everything just continued and got worse as the show fell into shock humor with some vuage messages about growing up  the art style was never appealing for a reason
Jordan Peele is involved in this show? Why?
Holy shit, pick an accent, dude.
I like stupid adult comedies but the oversexualization of kids really is a down vote on the show. I'd watch it if it got rid of that part. Like, you can cover the topic with out going overboard just because it's a cartoon and there are no rules
Yeah I tried watching this show when it came out but what it showed the kids woohoo but it had a face I was just done, like I didn't like looking at the show in the first place but that's just too far for me and unlike SouthPark the show just isn't funny
"You just want big mouth to be cancelled over other shows because you hate it and think it is bad" is the weirdest moral soapbox I've seen someone put themselves on so far this year
Remember when Leonard DiCaprio plaed a slave owner but no one thought he was racist outside of the movie? But that VA is white how dare they act vocally >>>>>:(
As a fan of big mouth without saying its gross or other shows shouldn’t of been canceled and big mouth should of its just not funny anymore and to most people it never was but the early seasons to me are great it just overstayed its welcome
LS mark looks worse than the new spongebob design
tbh yes there are very gross moments but also has very touching emotional storytelling especially with the spin off human resources
Me n my partner got 10 mins into the first episode n had to turn it off.. we just thought it was wierd n slightly gross.
I think people take Big Mouth way too much as a Coming of age story with comedy aspects, and not as much as  a Comedy show with coming of age aspects, which is what I think the show has always been. If you take everything they do with a little bit of Irony, the show becomes way more enjoyable and sometimes even just makes more sense from a writing viewpoint.
It a show that isn’t funny!
the hormone monster should've just been an angel on the shoulder sorta thing in my opinion 😭
25:29 That’s what shrooms does. Most likely they tried shroom candy. Or sum psychedelic but DEFINITELY NOT weed
the new art style looks fucking fantastic
Big Mouth has very positive reviews and lots of fans. You clearly just hang out in certain space online where people don't like Big Mouth.
Really couldn't care if its good or not, the art style is nauseating and I refuse to watch it for that reason alone.
Out of interest, what is your accent? Northern Irish / American?
25:11  I know the true feeling since ’m a stoner, weed doesn’t do that so no cartoon or show or movie have portrayed weed high correctly. And don’t get me started on stoner films, I hate the stereotype. On social media, I call myself a fit stoner. And since I’m religious, when I think of to watch p**n, I do push-ups & dumbbell curls.
The animation is not hard work the writing is not hard work 90% of the people there would probably be doing something better with their time and the other 10 would probably do something just as shit.
First couple seasons was just dumb fun with some decent jokes and wacky storylines, but it’s completely devolved into the soulless base of all that. To me it’s just overdone now, and super weird they’re still in middle school, tried watchin the last season and it was a middle school orgy, like just age them up, keeping characters the same age doesn’t work for every cartoon, and growing up with these characters would’ve. Set it apart, but they dropped the ball in every way
We need more f is for family
the writing could be on par with breaking bad, but the art style makes me physically ill to look at it and i refuse to sit through it.
Yes.
2:46 I watched the entire seasons of Bug Mouth and it’s spin-off show. I’m a huge fan. I don’t why it gets a lot hate, it’s WAY WAY WAYYYY better than that Velma show. Also I like Missy’s character development from a nerdy girl to a lil boss bitch.
Hey mark we’re can I get laser pointer?!:)
Marks new character stills make me uncomfortable but I’m not sure why
your accent is hard to listen too! its MO UTH not MARTH, you need to work on your english because i don't believe it's your first language
I will say this. Rotten tomatoes or any other similar site are not helpful in determining quality. It only tells you what people who write rotten tomatoes reviews think. Not everyone leaves a rating or comment. Most people I'd say watch it then move on, whether they like or hate it. So aggregate sites don't give you a proper sample size
Widely acclaimed? By who? Actual morons?
i think that this show has a good idea but absolutely abominable execution. i was forced to watch season 1 by a friend in 2017 and watched bits of season 2 with my sibling whenever that came out, and oh my god. i don’t know if this is too universal of an experience, but i find this show unstoppably triggering. puberty and development is something i find fascinating but this show instills in me paralyzing emotional dismay that i can’t get through, and i think every message in the episodes i’ve seen has either fallen short or been wrong completely.
That tekken 5 soundtrack unlocked hidden memories from my childhood
this show rips. 3 season fell off but the newest with the adults problems is so good
I called myself a fan of Big Mouth. I enjoy watching stuff and just turning my brain off and taking it for the dumb fun and shock humor it is. However, I watched Human Resources and enjoyed it so much more.
Its kind of like Fairly Odd Parents..  So they're just as loyal to the concept as FOP was.
I genuinely don't understand how if two girls breath in the same direction in a show, Netflix will not hesitate to cancel it, but somehow 10 minutes long close up of literal minors' intimate parts are 100% okay
Idk I like the show. I get people are pissy that their shows are being cancelled. I will say I do prefer its sister show human resources. It's less about kids and their weird sexual appetites. More about people's emotions etc... I do however disappointed that chozen was cancelled. So I do get people's disappointment.
Yes
NO DEAD END
your a cuck mark
Im 30% in this video and im starting to suspect that you just dont understand this show...  Sorry, but Maury didnt came from alien fkin the earth. Those monsters are invisible... How someone comes to the conclusion, idk.  Looking at a simple apple and complaining that its not grapefruit enough, and how its "suppose" to be more like this or that, cuz thats what u expect, is a bit childish. Nitpicking random things, like "oh, he can make earthquaces now" made me actually laugh.
(Before watching the video) I don't know and I don't care. Have fun!
of all the shows that could feature one of my favorite songs from one of my favorite bands ninja sex party, it just had to be *B I G  M O U T H*
One of my issues with big mouth is that it doesn’t seem to ever shut up. I haven’t seen the whole show but every episode I have seen is just constant, non-stop, talking without any room for jokes to breath. Simpsons, old family guy, South Park don’t have this issue. There are a lot of other issues I have too but that is one of if not the biggest.
I think a huge element of it is subject matter. PUBLICALLY AND SOCIALLY this is all very, very sensitive subject matter that people feel uncomfortable for others about and think its all taboo subjects that shouldn't be discussed especially using kid/teen subjects. But the reality is. Internally and personally speaking. Those problems are nonsense and fade away on the personal individual level. There are no ACTUAL problems with the subject matter of the show. No one is being harmed or damaged.   But everyone feels the need to virtue signal about how wrong it is in public, how uncomfortable it makes them for seeing it. But you know, and I know. That these are signs of social morality immaturity. Not anything the show itself is actually doing wrong. Most people understand that in private, in their heads too. So they watch it and are perfectly comfortable watching it lol.
sorry for whatever tf is going on with twitter and the Just Stop guy. Keemstar's seen that whole thing so I'm pretty sure everyone's gonna know about it soon so I'd maybe reach out to them to try and stop it from getting worse, if that's what you want.
Belfast. Australia. America. Where is the accent from?
finally another hr long vid. I been waiting on this
I love the look of your new avatar!
Netflix: ALRIGHT, ALL OF YOU ARE CANCELLED, NOW GET OUT OF HERE! * a lot of shows go away * Netflix: except you, you stay * points to Big Mouth *
the more you watch, the more youll understand the answers to your questions mark. ive watched all 6 seasons and trust me. they flesh things out later on
Not a fan of the new avatar
You should do one of these for velma
Eh. Ive never cared too much about the hard work and effort that goes into stuff when it comes to what gets cancelled and what doesn't. It should be about the show's quality and it bothers me when people rely on "oh but look at how much effort they put into it". I tried really hard to draw something from darkest dungeon the other day but the amount of effort i put in does not correlate to how good it is and thats just how it is, that shitty picture of the hero ring doesn't deserve praise and stuff because of the effort i put in and if i were to lazily draw something good then yeah that would deserve more praise.  Quality comes from more than just effort, it also comes from skill and resources and creativity and probably a whole bunch of other shit
big mouth is a disgusting piece of crap
Before the show came out everyone was hating on it then after it came out everyone said it was actually pretty good, now everyones hating on it
Yooo the new reaction pictures are looking clean!
The difference between Big Mouth and Velma is as follows: Big Mouth has its moments. *Every* moment of Velma, is pain.
I don’t think the show goes on because everyone loves it. I think it’s because Nick Krolls dad is basically a billionaire and funding his sons passion project
missys actress changing is so retarded not only because the actress is white but because the character in the show is MIXED meaning shes just as much white as she is black, no reason to change anything. but they can take historically white figures like vikings and make them black
Why can't this dude say mouth instead of motuhe
Mark have you ever played Demon Turf? Its right up your alley, a pretty good 3d platformer with a 2d animated protagonist
Thé animations of thé girlich hormone Monster IS sooo great i Love it
I still wanna know what happend to 2 last Inside Job Episodes  Netflix Order 20 Episodes But there are only 18 episodes of Season 1 Splited on 2 Parts for some unknow reason
Love the new art style looks great
Not great but it could have been perfectly passable as a mediocre show….if it didn’t have all the….graphic imagery
In my opinion, I think Season 6 was by far the most educational. And I think if I was a pre-teen I would find alot of this seasons episodes helpful through puberty. I undertstand the vulgur nature can be off-putting, but geniunely that is the audience they cater to.
i never watched big mouth but i remember seeing an episode where one of the characters was trans and that stuck with me because it feels like trans people don’t get much representation
I like big mouth because it was funny and was pretty realistic and relatable however once it got two season three near the end it just got so unrealistic that I couldn't watch it is the same thing that killed Rick and Morty the show became to meta
Love that u covered this. Ppl be trippin
32:19. Animators we’re payed to animate FORTNITE on that TV………..🗿
48:22 yea goober (:
I somehow watched the show for 3 seasons unironically
Not even watching the video to answer this one  If you are of your Father, satan-the devil, lover of Wickedness, Perversion and Abominations  This program is definitely for you, ENJOY!!!  But, if you are of your Father, The Most High and His Son.......Righteousness and Sanctified- Holiness   " Be Ye Separated "  Simple, Everybody have a good day
This was the last straw I have cancelled my NF sub there were a few things I watched on NF and fewer original series I had 3 left Chicago Party Aunt, Paradise PD and DEAD END... it's not worth it any more.!  What NON-original series I watched I can get on Prime or even Tubi or PlutoTV (free) and the 2 orig. shows I watch I now feel no guilt over torrenting.   As far as I am convinced Any Original IP creators should be warned that working with Netflix is a death sentence. They have cancelled every single one of my favorite IPs Dead End, Boss Baby: Back In Business for Back In The Crib (based on the 2nd movie while I did not see the first one I started watching the show and feel in love with it imagine 4 year old chick falling in love with the show... mainly due to the Triplets. I watched the first movie though it very average, then just watched BB2: Back In Business and it sucked... the ew series is not as as bac as the movie but, the first series was better) , Z Wars, October Faction. The Only 2 I have left are Chicago Party Aunt which just dropped series 1 part 2  to a very lesser extent after watching the first episode of season 4 Paradise PD .  Perhaps the creators need to sign contracts that state that they retain all control and rights to/over the IP and should Netflix cancel it they have the right to either pull the property from them and take already created content from that platform (even for a buy-back fee for the  created content) and the IP to another platform...
10:28 you're kinda right. But at the same time, do you want actual kids to say these things. Or do you want these characters to resemble even more like kids? It'll just make the show even more uncomfortable, and it's already pretty uncomfortable
Mark you took a cartoon about jerk off monsters and looked at everything wayyyy too literally. Its a turn your brain off show. More questions you ask, less fun it is.
Just like mentioned in your conclusion, most of the complaints I see about the show are about the artstyle and the....how to word it...'overzealous' direct depictions of teenage sexuality. I can get why these put a lot of people off, but the show definitely gets a lot of unearned hate. Cancelling it would not suddenly mean Netflix would start treating their other projects with any more respect. That being said, #SaveWarriorNun!
I like big mouth and humped for next season
As someone who never complained about Big Mouth, I really can't blame people for being upset about a show they were interested in being canceled rather than this abomination. It's very understandable. That said, I can at least appreciate that this show is original and not taking a beloved IP just to shit on it and it's fandom.
u skimmed past "jerking off to the corpse of his grandfather" way too fast there bucko, WHAT
Boondocks showed me a naked older black man in the first episode, and I shrugged and said "That's actually so funny".  Big Mouth showed me a child, and I canceled my Netflix subscription and never went back.
We love you mark!
I remember being 15 the first time I watched it... I'm 19 now. I loved the show at first relating to the weird parts of puberty but i feel as though the show itself didn't grow...   I loved andrew because he made mistakes but seemed like a nerdy guy who felt real (at first). Puberty is weird and confusing. It brings with it anxiety, insecurities, shame. Which all add to odd situations.   I loved the relationships the characters had with each other and the fun of it all.   However, with all that being said. The show and characters dont grow. Like Andrew has so much potential but keeps fumbling the bag.   They seem like they also want to tackle family dynamics. However they don't show how truly devastating having a dysfunctional family is during puberty. They never grow or learn. Nothing, I need to feel rewarded with development.   I hate the overly sexual aspect. I wished they'd at least use it to development the story more.
LS Cuck
love the improved art!
Whoever made this Show looks like they had some Weird Fetish with Where the Wild Things Are💀
Regardless of what you have to say on it, thank you for making a video on Big Mouth. I barely see anyone making videos on this show.
LS Mark does not smoke weed.
yooo the new art style looks great
yes
Idk where you're getting this impression that the concept was genius. It's really not.
The first time I heard about Big Mouth outside of in passing was in a news article that said it was like modern sex education for adults who may not have had the best sex ed growing up. And while obviously a raunchy animated sitcom isn't a replacement for real sex ed, I think it's fair to say sex education in the western world reeeeeeeeeeeally varies depending on region. With some places getting updated curriculum way later than they should, or even getting it reverted back to an older, out of date model. While Big Mouth fails in certain areas, I think it's undoubtedly responsible for at least a handful of adults developing a better relationship with their bodies, sexuality, mental health, and understanding of those things and more in others.   I also really like most of the characters. I see myself in some of them, with some of them bringing up thoughts or going through experiences that I had too. And the Monsters stuff never really confused me. They're like imaginary friends who have their own stuff going on when they're not dealing with the Human they're assigned to, and who can see and interact with them fluctuates depending on who they're helping and what the scene calls for. That's pretty straightforward to me.  Ultimately I guess I think some stuff on Netflix gets renewed because of wild flukes or poor algorithms, but Big Mouth isn't one of them, at least not to me. There's an inherent value to this show, even if by design it makes some people uncomfortable. It isn't doing that to be edgy or meta, it's just the nature of the topics they deal with.
Missy is the only character with depth.
i fucking cant stand how ugly this show is
The "this show got cancelled but Big Mouth gets another season?" argument in my opinion isn't just to sh1t at it for no reason  I think it's because shows with a way better concept and more potential were scrapped while a much simpler plot show got such a wide runtime.  Because let's be honest, how long can a show talk  about puberty and NOT get old?
Keep saying it
23:58 anyone knows the ost being played in the back????
I am super mixed when it comes to this series, I'm asexual so I would personally prefer a censor, I don't have a problem with seeing nudity but I'd rather not see kids like that & it's more than that like it actually gets a little detailed on stuff which like when they stick to it being more metaphorical like with Lola's castle, that's fine because we're not seeing it & while the description is so unappealing, it does get the point across. I was a teenager once, I get that kids do things, my little sister lost her virginity in our back garden shed when she was 15 & it's fine to explore that aspect of growing up, it exists & we can't just sweep it under the rug but I don't care for them flaunting it. There's a more respectable way to go about it.  So yes, I did watch the series but I was mostly on board for the emotional stuff because I liked it when they touched on mental health, that is my jam. With Depression Kitty getting distracted by a laser pointer, speaking as someone that has depression, it sometimes does work like that, at least for me. Depression does feel like a big, warm, cozy cat forcing you to lay in bed all the time, when it happens to me, sometimes I can bring myself to binge a bunch of reddit videos or travel videos but mostly, I'm in a cocoon for who knows how long? Sometimes, something can come along & distract me, typically nothing will sound good to me like the things I love? Getting me to take part in them is like pulling teeth but somehow, something will just click like maybe an event will happen in a game I like & my friends are all talking about how much fun it is so I'll climb on, it takes a lot of lift to do so but when I do, that's the laser pointer, I get so distracted by the game, it has me just distracted from being depressed, I suddenly can snap into getting things done & actually taking care of myself but it's only lessened, it will come back, it always comes back, but sometimes, it's just much smaller.  As for the complaint on people seeing & not seeing them, I did watch all of Human Resources, I actually like that series far more than Big Mouth like I'm on board the cancel Big Mouth train & give Human Resources like 5 more seasons, PLEASE! With that said, I can only sit through the series once, um yeah, I have a hard time watching the show in the first place so I can't go back & re-watch episodes. So if I forgot stuff which I do, it's fine to correct me on theories because like I remember some stuff sort of, the memory is very fuzzy, it might disprove my theory but I can't properly remember so I don't know. I think the way it goes is when monsters are visiting their clients, they make it so the only humans that see them in the moment are the clients because like it would be a total violation of privacy otherwise.  Yes, you're ready to throw hands & disprove this as in the series itself, we've had people see other people's monsters, Nick saw Mauri in the beginning & I think that might be a wink towards Nick being the one in charge, Mauri's boss, I could be wrong. What about Caleb? As someone who is on the spectrum, I will point out that when you're autistic, you tend to be more sensitive towards various things. I know, I have a lot of touch & sound sensitivity, I think Big Mouth has established that there is a sort of sixth sense when it comes to monsters. The thing I was eluding to earlier that might disprove this theory is a character from Human Resources. So sad that I can't entirely remember this plot point properly but there was something about a therapist being able to see her client's love bug (I think, my memory is foggy) & they fall in love which isn't allowed. I think they treat this as like a sixth sense that people can tune into, she's unable to see the one she fell in love with later on but she could somewhat feel the presence, if I recall correctly. So it's a thing I guess that can be turned off in emergencies? I don't know. Caleb is probably in tune to this or just sensitive towards it like I think they indicate that Mauri is his hormone monster too so maybe he's just always able to see Mauri due to being in touch with this sense? They definitely need to do a better job at this but I think more so it might of been a throw away joke & I'm reading too far into it.  The show remains inconsistent with who sees certain monsters when & when the monsters can indeed see each other all the time, it does get weird when people who see their own monster don't interact with them acknowledging other monsters. I really just wish they'd stick to Human Resources, that one is good enough to where I might watch it a second time if they do release a second season so I can be reminded of things that happened. I did remember enough to be able to follow along with season 6 of Big Mouth but yeah, I did not care for that season, the only plot point that drew my attention was the one involving Elijah because I feel that, it was so weird being one of the few kids in middle school who wasn't horny. Like I'd always just play cards with the boys every day after lunch & all the girls kept asking me questions about the different boys & wanted to know if I was dating any of them & I was so confused like they're my friends & we were kids, I wasn't thinking about any of that at the time & even when I got older & understood better, I just wasn't interested. Seeing Elijah's journey reminded me a lot of my own except I wasn't ever into religion, my parents are Catholic but they never devoted to the religion & they're actually sex positive. When they found out my sister did it in the garden shed, they weren't pissed about her having sex, they were angry that the boy was 13 & felt as though she took advantage of him & gave her a rundown on consent, also told her about waiting until they reach a certain age & so on. It's not my upbringing, it's just me being ace & for Elijah, he has a lot of the same feelings I do but like there's the whole stuff with the church that definitely stuffed down those emotions like for any kids who aren't ace that's apart of that program, I feel sorry for them once they hit puberty. It was interesting seeing his story & how he learned about his sexuality, kinda scary given I question if some writers have been interviewing ace people because whoever did the writing for Todd in Bojack Horseman either spied on me or actually talked to ace people with similar stories & same goes for Elijah, they definitely got the emotional side nailed.  Sorry that was long, lots of thoughts running through my head. I'd never defend this show because it's just so....... yeah, you've seen it, you know, but I have to give it credit for nailing (not in that sense) things so well. When they get it right, they get it right & I even find myself using lessons taught in the show sometimes such as the Gratitoad, doesn't work all the time but it's helped me when those anxiety mosquitoes attack. I get it, teenagers have a hard time wrestling with these crazy hormones & stuff but sometimes, I wish they'd dial that back a bit & look more into the emotional side because that is harsh, especially in middle school. Shame Wizard definitely was stalking me there & there's just so much they can do within that setting. Middle schoolers are so much more mean & critical than high schoolers like they don't understand what is going on so they're more likely to lash out or push that pressure off of them & onto someone else. There's a ton socially they can address & have, I got excited when they did stuff like that. The whole hate conflict with bashing one another on social media is different from my middle school experience given social media wasn't that big of a deal like it is now, I knew kids that thought it was cool that I burned CDs using my mom's itunes & computer until they learned that according to them, I had awful taste in music. I also brought my Spongebob CD player to school which the kids thought was kinda silly, the boys I played cards with every day thought it was cool though. I switched to using my MP3 player in 8th grade, I did so to listen to my favorite morning radio show on the bus ride to school. As I was saying, I never had the whole using the internet to throw around hate at fellow peers situation but I'm aware it exists so it made sense when they tackled that situation although since I never was apart of that, I have no idea how much they got right. Wow, this was still long, again, sorry.
I just personally think the art style is ugly and I can’t get passed that in particular.
I have a lot of opinions about Big Mouth. I really like the show. It can be terrible and uncomfortable at some times, but I watched the show whilst going through puberty. Despite the cringe-worthy stuff, it's helped me figure myself out. And yet, even with my own acclaim held for this show... I'm still so pissed off that Inside Job was cancelled.
People forget if you guys really do hate something don't watch it. That's how you killed a TV show
I do think BIG MOUTH is overhated certainly if you take at face value as a standard “adult” cartoon, but don’t me wrong it still has the problems of it, in a similar vein to FAMILY GUY yet has deeper layers and lessons like SOUTH PARK. Ultimately the true problem is the cancel shows like INSIDE JOB, TWELVE FOREVER, and DEAD END: PARANORMAL PARK that are left unfinished or show that felt like they were rushed like CENTAUR WORLD, SHE-RA, BOJACK HORSEMAN, etc because of some unknown/unachievable goal that Netflix has for it’s shows or poor marketing on their part. For example I was interested in the show DEAD END: PARANORMAL PARK because a YouTube clip.
I think Jesse’s experience with puberty was pretty accurate, when I first got my period I was a fucking terror. Like when you said it doesn’t make sense for a kid to suddenly scream at their mom that they’re the patriarchy, I think that’s pretty accurate to my extreme mood swings after hitting puberty I had insane unbridled rage and I definitely yelled and screamed at my family at times that didn’t make sense to someone who didn’t know what was going on. I do think the show goes too far at time I hated the ending after the shame wizard it was wayyy too far and not funny. But I always thought the hormone monsters were like tooth fairy type beings so they’re not actually real and not actually there but all the kids can see and hear them, but the show definitely doesn’t make sense when they go further into the monsters world and stuff. But I personally don’t mind it not making sense. The show first came out when I was like 16 so I’ve watched it as a late teen/early 20s. I always thought it was kinda relatable bc I was a super raunchy middle schooler w my friends so I like that they were showing how much middle schoolers actually know about and how kids that age absolutely swear excessively and talk about sex and r rated stuff. I would have loved this show as a 13 year old and I would have totally related to it. As an adult I don’t think it’s appropriate for 12 year olds to watch, but at the same time I could have totally handled it and would have been offended if someone said it’s too “adult” for me. I think it’s for ppl w immature senses of humor (most teens probably), and it’s supposed to go too far because kids that age go wayyy too far bc they’re learning where the limits are, I think it’s almost satirical in that way. I feel like it’s supposed to feel like it’s almost created by middle schoolers that why it has some really unfunny, annoying, absolutely disgusting moments. And I think it criticizes itself and laughs at itself but I don’t think it’s necessarily a “good show”. I think I like it because what I related to in it and I was already a nick kroll fan when it came out. Also Jesse dealing with a yeast infection was soooooo relatable. I’ll acknowledge that the show is kinda bad but as bad as it is I’d much rather watch this than family guy. I think the vibe of the show not knowing what it really is or where it’s going is sort of relatable to a teen.
I 100% agree with the meta humor take one thing that really annoys me too about modern meta humor is a lot of shows now are using meta humor to advertise products or companies
One thing I can say is that the episode in the spin-off that deals with grief was genuinely handled well. The spin-off concept makes a lot more sense and is a lot better than the main series. With that one, I started watching when it came out so I had context with the discourse that was going on with it at the time, and keep up mainly out of curiosity. It isn't good, but there are some interesting ideas, and definitely could have been done so much better.
Now you changed your avatar.
At the start it was such a good show but the more times they drew Jessie’s v****a or something similar to that, the less I wanted to watch.😂
50:05 this plays when you go to hell
To me Big Mouth is a show where IMO should NOT have had this many seasons. It's almost like Netflix wanted to keep this similar to how showrunners wanted to keep Simpsons, Family Guy, and Spongebob alive even if their creators aren't working on them, some of whom are already dead (RIP). When I 1st heard about this, I didn't like hearing how it was based on. The animation is still to my eyes ugly as hell, and not to far when they introduce the "monsters" and added more lore into them, it made me lose any sense of "what am I even watching" when you explain their origins. I wouldn't mind if they just stayed imaginary and only certain people can see them. Have it where specific type of monsters be luring around certain characters reflecting on what they might be feeling or feelings they don't fully realized. The more meta humor this show goes for, with the frequent 4th wall breaks, talking about the wonderfulness of Netflix, or the bizarre joke about having certain VA's voicing characters that isn't voice by their actual race gets tiring very fast. That last one about the VA is a dumb excuse when your projecting a FICTIONAL CHARACTER should that line happen to be on there, blame the person who wrote the line or the bloody creator. This show has a weird bizarre ideal of creating it's rules and then have it where the next episode or 2 breaks said rules that it doesn't matter. Hormone Monsters exist, but their also imaginary, Ghost exist in this world for whatever reason, you can make a pillow pregnant and have pillow children..... you can see said Hormone Monster and others even if you don't experience puberty at the same age as everyone.... I refuse to believe this show ever being good. This is like being reminded of how CN kept saying "this show is your new favorite," when eventually should people ever look back onto shows like this many years later, they'll quickly remember why certain jokes or the logic/rules in this goes out the window. >.>
Wait hold on I would've sworn I saw a relationship video he posted earlier? Don't see it anymore, does anyone have any insight as to what happened? EDIT: It may have been the one on just stops channel, guess I was just tripping but I really thought I saw one on marks too but idk EDIT: Yeah nah I must've been tripping it was the just stop video, guess he changed the thumbnail, appreciate it guys👍
Ls mark smokes that gas confirmed
Great video but I hate how you didn’t understand that future Nick was a persona that nick boxed himself into to seclude himself from the word and embrace his anxiety of the eventuality of being alone.
Big Mouth gets hate because it's as close to CP as they can get without going to jail and we all know it. The only thing saving it is that the Hollywood elite love that shit
Nick Kroll did To Boldly Flre worse
Please leave Veronica.
The animation on this show is just terrible in my opinion
hold up IT IS THE LONGEST running show on netflix still.
You may mark my words, not today but in the near future bad things will come out about this guy (I'm referring to Nick Kroll the creator). Dude gives me creepy Dan Schneider vibes
12:47
I just find it Incredibly disgusting and unfunny
Ls mark leave your wife for she has become unfaithful and committed the sin of adultry for if one commits a sin it constitutes a divorce mark please listen to your fans for unlike her they care about you you don't have to stay with her you can do better than her as you can tell this is coming from the fact  just stop has  released his video about the situation as for veronic here is my message to thee how dare you betray and treat your husband so shamefully your soul  should be sent immediately to the fiery blue rotten egg smelling inferno to be destroyed for what you have done to your marriage you made a promise when that ring was put upon your finger damn you damn all of your soul to the darkest deepest part of HEEELLLLLL.
Thank you for explaining and breaking down the show. I had no desire to watch it and all this just solidified me never wanting to see it.  I can see maybe how some aspects of the show have value. And its nice people like it, somehow. But none of this makes me any less upset that actually well written and well designed shows are being canceled and Big Mouth remains. Especially when you say it felt like it had a solid ending in s4. Makes me so frustrated at Netflix.  Also, im not sure i agree with the sentiment that Big Mouth "isnt affecting other shows". Netflix has a budget and they are putting it towards Big Mouth, and letting other shows go. Like, its as simple as that.
i agree with all the bad things but for some reason it remains one of my favorite shows. it could have something to do with the fact that i started watching it when i was 14, meaning i was going through/ saw others going through the same things the characters were going through. i think i just became attached to the characters, but i wish they aged cause they have been 12-13(?) the whole series and im now 19 😭 theres also more you can do with older characters.
Kinda sad to see you're pussy whipped by veronica mark. Hopefully you'll get out of it
yeah man, not like I would know, but  you basically become a warm loaf of bread
I just wish Netflix would take the money they make off of a show like Big Mouth and let other shows take more time to develop instead of just killing them right away
inside job getting canceled means im probably not renewing my subscription for netflix.
I still wish F is for family got more seasons especially after the last season showing how grief can really run ur life.
Never watched this show, but I did see the scene of the girl talking to her bits on Instagram (I'm scared to say the word because YouTube deletes comments). I really appreciated that. Maybe as a guy you don't get it? But a lot of people with that anatomy don't get taught about it well, I remember I was but a lot of people don't. A lot of people don't realise there's multiple holes, or the names of the parts (a lot of people who sleep with persons who have that anatomy don't understand it either) so I'm okay with them showing the genitalia because genitalia isn't inherently sexual, it's for educational purposes. They're conversations that need to be had and for a coming of age show that talks about puberty I think it's very fitting.
Congrats on making it to trending, you deserve it! Love your vids!
Wait inside job was canceled 😞
Wait. This show. This FUCKING show. Actually acknowledge Freddie Mercury being Bisexual instead of just pasting him over as being gay?  Goddamnit, I guess I have to give them credit.
U suck at life...square. it's awesome. Thanks to 420. U might need that, or not...I'll be sure to skip your vids U sound "weir-dah" lol
I think theres something to be said about the designs of the monsters too, that makes it SO clear to me that none of the writers- or, at the very least the people who made the final choice on the designs- have no idea what going thru puberty is like for girls. The monstress is "pretty" with boobs and hips while the monster is "gross" with wrinkles and a stuck-out gut. Almost like they think puberty for girls is just... getting your period and getting boobs. They try to talk about body shame and the grossness for girls, but fumble the ball so badly.
During my teens I loved this show now I still am a fan but the content that involves there parts really makes me feel gross and should be turned down a couple notches
you arent alone <3
It's been a rough and scary couple of years, but we will support you no matter what! She's only hurting you and putting up with her will only make things worse.
Love love LOVE your updated character design!! The art looks fantastic!!
Your a pissbaby
To answer the video title’s question… yes. It’s really bad.
On another note, I cringe a bit when people say “it’s child 🌽”, or “sexualizes children” and honestly find it to be a bit of a self report 🫣.    I totally agree it’s crudeness may not be for everyone, but Big Mouth besides South Park and Family Guy may be the first adult show who’s ugly art-style is completely justified. It’s so ugly that it’s basically impossible to sexualize, making the characters not seem sexy to people. Them not sounding like kids also has that purpose too, so I will defend that aspect of the show. If they had child voices or even a decent art style then I could personally understand the concerns people talk about more. It’s art-style is a encapsulation of the awkwardness of puberty. It’s honestly genius to me.   Fans of this show or those who find it funny like it because they relate to it or simply find it funny. I totally understand why those with family-guy levels of immature humor tastes enjoy the show.   I think the writing outside of the jokes is mediocre past S2, and I can understand the criticism the video makes. I can admit I’ve laughed a lot at this show and enjoyed it. It’s not even because I cannot critically analyze the media while I’m watching it, but because Big Mouth as a comedy show does it’s main purpose to make me laugh.   I feel like many who passionately  hate this show (not everyone, so if the shoe doesn’t fit don’t bother) as much as Velma need to admit that they just can’t personally handle the level of crudeness this show has, and there’s nothing wrong with that.   Overall, I agree the writing as a whole is probably not past mediocre, but it’s just funny and (sometimes) relatable, and that’s good enough for me.
It has its moments. And I say that lightly. It could be so much better and a great show. But they really cross the line and take things too far and just put too much nonsensical stuff in it. Which ruins it.
I would love to see Mark make a video about “Bojack Horseman”, a full series review and “Rick and Morty”.
number 9 on trading
Yes it is indeed
It’s like the creators want to be praised for “bringing up” taboo topics, but all they do is bring them up, make a shitty joke about it, and move on
Ik I don’t know you personally or anything about you but don’t stay with her it’ll only hurt you more and you’ll lose friends that actually care about you so I hope you get better
Ahhh love that consistency is always the fuck yo on modern shows 😂 I talk about show like how u do very few people to talk to about it in an interesting way
We're did the sonic figure go?
My issue is that the characters don’t seem to “learn” anything from the previous season. Well, mainly the main 3 characters, Missy is fine.  Like we’ve had 5+ seasons with Nick not learning to treat his family like shit. 5+ seasons with Jeremy not getting over jealousy/insecurity and making the same masturbation joke.  Everything else is fine.
I wouldn't have even given this show your time it is clear pedo bait and it makes me sick
hope your good bro🙏
Man ...I know it's unrelated but... you deserve so much more dude I hope you get to be happy, there's awful people in the world but you didn't gave birth to them so they should mean nothing to you, there's more fish 🐠 in the God damn sea and really awesome ones and who cares if you caught an ugly carp man you can keep fishing 🎣 that's the beauty of fishing lol anyway love your videos man stay strong king!
i don't know why but i've watched every season of big mouth (including the spin off) and it's like i can't stop, im probably going to watch the next season too but it's not the worst show, i agree that it is gross and confusing but i think it has a lot of good parts too, i really think it's gotten better every season, but honestly anything andrew related i hate
Big mouth markiplier
I didn’t know SimplyDad edited your videos. Thats pretty cool, love that guy
I'm too caught up in the background music to watch the video.... Streets of Rage 2 Dreamer?! That shit still Slaps!
So far this review is just pure nit picking, so the jokes aren't your style so its bad? So because you dont agree with the lore of the world its bad? So because you dont like the art style its bad? You even agreed that it was well animated frame wise and pointed out how the show wanted ugly characters. But because there ugly its bad?? And because they arent fully mature off rip its bad? (because its a coming of age show) This whole video was a biased opinion  label as a reveiw, horrible work as a reviewer. Title should be "how i feel about this show without research"
all the best to you mark
Mark is in a abusive relationship with women 8 years older then him please get him help now.
im just mad they don't take the time to support shows with clearly better plots, themes and creativity(yes, I'm very salty about Inside job still)
I know people often use this show as a scapegoat for how better shows are canceled while this is up, but honestly I think Paradise PD/Farzar should be more guilty.  At least Big Mouth is a popular show. Farzar has like what? 50 people watching it?
Stop with the bass boosted audio at random times. It's annoying and stupid like the change in art style
Yes it is. And yeah it is.
Crazy how south park takes everything that big mouth tries to do and does it better in every single way.
I’m sorry to hear about all the issues that are going on with your wife
I've always had this feeling the show would be less hated if its artstyle wasn't so damn ugly and if it wasn't so common for it to look as if they wanted to gain an audience with morbid curiosity rather than with a genuine attempt to educate or be funny about how much puberty can suck but you got no other choice than dealing with it
For me I like the show cuz it feels like the writer's are just having fun & doing whatever, & It does have it's moments.
Congrats on the wife
I know that sometimes out of love or insecurity it is hard for us to see the problems that our partners cause us. I hope everything gets better for you LS Mark, you deserve the best
I dont know if you hear this but i hipe your aok
The idea of Nick having a the hormone monstress in s3 could be an interesting way to explore intersex puberty but unfortunately this show is not well written enough to handle it well
leave ur abusive wife pls bro
New pfp is bad
I just want to let you know that many of us hope you are doing alright.
Music credits
2:40 he literally said “big mœth”
We hope you’ll be ok even if we don’t know you.
Damn number 9 on trending
Bro dump her
liked your video, best of luck with your next binge review
We live in a society
Wow I like the animation change ❤ except for the arms
I sincerely hope you're doing alright mark, you seem like such a genuinely chilled out guy and it sucks to see that you've been through such a confusing and toxic relationship. If by some miracle you're reading this good luck with everything <3
your wife is a toxic asshole and you need to get away from her asap
I have hope for you mark, when it’s time to tell what is what & why we’ll support you still. Love for you always. 3 years of being a fan
I hate the new art style personally
Honestly i really like big mouth. Even tho is mostly gross out humor, but sometimes theres acually a handfull of good episodes, the show teached me more than biology classes lol
before I start the real video, saying that people just like to hate is not a good argument, there is real points you can dissect there and just saying that people are hypocrites especially since a lot of people believe shows like Big Mouth to be CP and thus worthy of being cancelled not a good argument, even if Big Mouth isn't CP style at all
yes.
I enjoy Big Mouth bc certain parts are relatable but I definitely have to put aside A LOT to enjoy it
Go suck the creators dick while watching with another shows director. 😂🤣😂😂🍆☝🏼☝🏼☝🏼☝🏼
Damn mark your relationship with your wife is toxic   https://youtu.be/R2n3Ikpg_dw
Dear God Not Another Ugly Gay Cartoon Series .... Jeez Guys
You say mouth weird. The best thing Nick Kroll was in is The League.
Most people I knew thought the first season was fun. After the 2nd or 3rd the show just got weird. Idk who likes that sh*t.
i like watching big mouth because i can switch my brain off. i feel like as soon as you start thinking about any aspect of it it entirely falls apart.
I hate your new style
I watched up to season 5 of big mouth and even went back to do an analysis of it to see if the story is actually decent. Well, it has its moments but the show overall to me was bad, I highly recommend season 4 and nothing else. The explanation and carefully plotted out explanation of how since Matthew admitted that he likes jay shows that dichotomy of interests. Where someone wants stability but still craves a negative experience. Which is why he started off gay and sassy to gay and sweet then as season six happened. Jay got nice and now Matthew isn't interested. A lot of things get dropped like coach Steve getting better but still being him. The Trans, pan, and asexual characters all popping in and not really being a focal point. Too many characters that are trying to become the main one.
I always thought the rule was you can only see your hormone monster. Even if your hormone monster with someone else you would be able to see them. So, when nick is with jessie they both can see Connie cause Connie is both of there monsters. Tbh I always saw it as just fucked up fairy odd parents and that's how they work. When weather a hormone monster or a love bug or whatever monster was assigned to you leaves you forget them. What even I forgot his name but that one kid with the bag with him 24/7 say I always saw that as meta stuff or maybe he says them cause he's special. If you watch human Resouces, that could be a genuine reason. I always think the last eps of each season is just to break continuity is that good no but that's how I always saw it. Thats just how I saw it, tbh it should be 100% more clear cause it did take me a good ass second to figure out what is what. Human Resouces does answer a lot of of the questions but it should be in the main show.
guys icon became 3d like all animation
i was 13 when Big Mouths 1st season aired and am turning 20 in april . i’ve watched every season religiously without even much questioning whether i still enjoyed the show or not lol! until now i’ve never wondered why but i can say it’s one of the only constant things i’ve had in my evolution thru being a teen to adulthood especially doing it in the co*id era where nothing was promised but another season of big mouth lol idk that’s sim deep shiznet fr but yeah that def might have something to do with the undying love hate relationship
i dont think this show is HORRIBLE like alot of ppl say...its not good tho lol
personally I think it’s overhated, while the recent seasons have less redeeming qualities some earlier episodes are genuinely entertaining.
It's dumb, it's basic and it's so damn ugly
love the sprite upgrade
The first 3 seasons of Big Mouth are fine and funny. The latest ones however are just nasty and over the top. The script and voicing is so obnoxious and whiny now, it detracts from the story line SO MUCH. I hate it because the show is approaching such sensitive and valuable topics!!! Its a damn shame.
Yes.
bro got the TotallyNotMark outro
2:15
Meta jokes are funny the problem is people are using them to much, the same rule applies to any joke.
Who else feels bad for featuring Ludacris?
Yes
I think the show is okay, but also when I binged it I was sick out of my mind with a high fever lmao. But I do enjoy the spin off show a lot more, I like the ideas behind it and it just seems more organized than Big Mouth? I don’t know if that makes rant sense
i frankly apologize as deeply as i can, i love your content and i've watched most of your other videos, and as interested as i am in this topic, i literally couldnt watch this because of how much big mouth's art aggravates me i never thought i would be literally coping over art, but i cannot fathom that a studio with over a thousand dollar budget makes this
What sucks is that adult animation is a genre that has the potential to be amazing, but Netflix canceling 3 of the few hidden gems in a few years kinda hurts. what's worse is that all 3 series had a season 2 planned, but were cancelled after season 1.
lmao you cannot f**king talk properly please practice saying words correctly god d**n it.
Ok but like, that's not far from how you get someone out of a depressive episode. From my own experiences, dealing with myself and others in a situation like this, genuinely the best way to pull someone out of a depressive episode is to distract them from it. Obviously this is not how you deal with depression as a whole, just depressive episodes and spirals. So, treating depression I give them a C. In treating a depressive spiral I'll give them an A.  Also, cool life hack for those of us with Depression and ADHD, do the things that normally cause your ADHD to thrive if you're in a depressive episode. Depression's strength is in getting you to focus on it, ADHD is just a built in counter.
TL:DW the show is not good but it's getting slightly less bad with each season unlike the shows that got cancelled before they got a chance to improve even though they were already better than big mouth
yes. *closes video*
this thumbnail jumpscares me every time i see it on my recommended
Big mouth is just a demonstration that the world is unfair. That untalented hacks with tons of money can make a long-running show as long as you get the lowest common denominator interested. It's nepotism, money and honestly the most normie show for normies I could possibly think of. This is why the world is broken.
Kuddos to you for being able to stomach 6 seasons of... that. The characters are awful, the humor is degrading and the art style is so bafflingly nasty it's kinda impressive. Also, the show has pretentious woke moments that ONLY people living in Hollywood would agree with. Out of touch writers, especially Nick Kroll and John Mulaney.
33:31 markiplier
I like how Mark can always find good things in cartoons no matter how bad they are. And vice versa. His opinions really open my eyes
yes
Didn't know you did speedruns for the Any% Demonitized No Glitch/Exploits Category
Big Mouth has gotta have one of the ugliest character designs I've ever seen
i havent watched the video but already yes. its not the worst but objectively it is not good
I really enjoyed seasons 1 and 2, but I couldn’t make it through season 3 due to too much going on, but if it picks back up in the end of 3 and all of 4 I might have to give it another chance
I can't believe Big Mouth would do something so vulgar, indecent, and borderline criminal as... ripping off To Boldly Flee!  Also, I will STILL never get comfortable with two different Marks on Youtube using the same Dragonball music as an outro.
..... you can't say sexual? Jesus YouTube
I think you take the show and everything that happens in it way too literally.
Really digging the art shift!! I honestly thought it would take me a few videos to get used to it, but it's done JUST RIGHT to the point that it's in no way jarring. Not enough of a change to start a sonic-esque "NOT MY MARK (HE HAS A NECK!!!!)" split, but definitely enough to be refreshing :)
It hurts to find out that Inside Job got cancelled by Netflix in a video about Big Mouth.
Big Mouth isn't great or horrible, it's kind of like that one friend that's always trying to tell jokes, some are good, so fall flat, and some are just why.
If you think this series is the issue and not Elite, Money Heist or those kind of shows you are just dumb. This series with all its downsides is 100 times more interesting and uses much more crazy concepts than those kind of useless teen series that actually need millions of dollars to be produced.  After all i just want justice for Bojack
Yes it is
i didnt know dead end was cancelled boo :(
That whole "blacks can only voice blacks" thing is so stupid. Let's just ignore years and years of voice acting mastery and talent for a couple of Twitter brownie points.
Tbh i watched it up until like the 4th or 5th season? It wasn't my kind of show but I adore the LGBTQ+ scenes that can be actually emotional and good representation. They say the words - Pansexual, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, etc. The kids can come out and have scenes of growth (even one-of characters) and it genuinely shows them developing relationships/ending it/staying together in a healthy and realistic way. Say what you will but when they want to they can create rather beautiful moments.... inbetween all the nasty anyways.
New LS Mark character sprites are crazy they look like a tv movie version of the old ones
*White* actress.
This video was kinda hard to get through. Not that it was poorly made or anything, but the bleeps were way too frequent, and honestly made it a frustrating watch some of the time. I get it, YouTube is cracking down on you hard and you won't make any money if you don't follow their ridiculous strict rules. But is it even worth it at this point if you can't make new content without compromising? It may be time to start making money elsewhere and use YouTube more as a hobby. That way you could make your videos more unfiltered like before and not feel like you have to avoid stepping on toes.  I think it's important to make this decision sooner rather than later, since if this continues I might not be able to watch your videos anymore without getting annoyed, no matter how much I respect you as a creator. But really, I think it would be for your own best as well.
Human Resources is actually pretty good though it actually had a story
that's strange ? i thought this would be 56:00 of you just saying ''no it is not''
Yeah still amazing
It had moments but the bad and needlessly disgusting moments weren’t worth it. I think it’s a fun place to go see the most hypocritical “comedians” flocked. The most judgmental actors doing the worst subject matter
I honestly like Human Resources a little more. It is a little more… perfect? It is just hormone monsters and others
My two big takeaways from this review are: 1) based on the abortion episode and some of the line deliveries, this show sounds preachier than Family Guy in its political messaging, and 2) the fact that they drew attention to changing voice actors for the one girl, but didn't make a "my voice is changing due to puberty" joke indicates that there isn't much intelligence behind the writing staff.
Y E S
Big Mouth is pedophile normalizing shit. Don't bother replying to argue with me, because I am correct and you are wrong.
Thumbnail REALLY screams Duck Lips.
Human Resources is better
Pedophiles aren’t humans
This man’s “ou” sounds sound like every vowel combined. Idk. I personally really liked Big Mouieath.
I cant finish this video big mouth is just too fucking ugly
Summary Yes
The dragon ball tune at the end made me think i was watching a different Mark. But i was Totally Not right
basic summary: it's ok👍👎
Mark 2.0 is giving me Sonic Boom vibes
I understand that you need to apparently censor constantly thanks  to youtubes new rules, but man i wish there was a better, less harsh on the ears sound for said censors, It makes this video pretty hard to get through...
I remember finding big mouth hilarious when I was like 13 when the first season came out. But as the show has gone on and I’ve become older I’ve really grown to hate it. It honestly gives me a sick feeling just watching it now.
Nick Kroll is very hit or miss and a lot more misses for sure like the Kroll show has 8 boring and I mean terrible boring sketches for every decent one he's just not a very talented comedian also (the girl being voiced by a white woman being changed just because the internet told them too is so gross it proves they don't care they just pander I personally think it's dumb ppl get upset about cartoons being voiced by someone of a different race it's dumb like it's a cartoon it's fake outrage)
Ok really off topic but I love your new art style lol looks really good! 😭
I mean the show has really got some plot points even though it does show all thre graphic nudity that most shows won't show and I applaude them for that as they shouldn't shy away from all the awkwardness of sex and such topics like periods and saying no to peer when it comes handjobs etc and I'm obsessed with this and Human Resources as it's got a great cast like David Thewlis, Helen Mirren and Thandiwe Newton and what's the connection to all these actors? they're all British actors
big mouth is weird. i had mixed opinion tbh
The art style alone makes me want to puke.
yes
Big Mouth was really good
One thing that really changed my perspective on this show is when i found out the reason it looks so ugly: Its purposefully hideous so its impossible to actually be sexually attracted to the characters. I still think the show is WAY too gross, but i at least respect that decision.
Yes
Inside job was sacrificed so this cringe can live past it’s already expired expiration date, I’m not ok with that.
Some moments I laughed so hard my ribs hurt and other moments I cringed
watching just because i never want to see that thumbnail again
Why did I lose Inside job, but this piece of shit exists
I like big mouth- it’s so funny and is written very well.
You should do a vid on gravity falls
Seeing you as big mouth cursed me
Never heard of it. Is that bad? Lol
SpongeBob is the exception to the rule because the first 3 seasons are gold
Yeah I hate when shows try to show how wacky and wild weed is, when everyone knows it’s nothing like that it comes across as a terrible joke
I could never watch Big Mouth due to how graphic it gets. I love the idea of a coming of age story that focuses on struggles with puberty and sexuality, but I'd feel like a creep seeing so many of the graphic scenes.
after watching this, I still have the exact same opinion. The show is genuine garbage and deserves to be cancelled.
I have to say you have some good taste with background music.
Digging the new Mark design, looks clean and expressive!
While I'd never call Big Mouth a masterpiece, there are aspects I enjoyed that kept me watching. Going through puberty as a girl I was completely unprepared, the topic was taboo on my house and I honestly related to a lot of what Jessie went through. Also I appreciate Missy and her struggles being Biracial and accepting herself. That also hit me on a person level as growing up there were not media that represented biracial children and struggles of fitting in.   On that note, the show has definitely gone downhill. I'm really shocked it's still going over other animated series. Also Nick is the worst character.
any big mouth watcher that enjoyed the pillows? they gave me anxiety kinda
It is
Cobra kai got canceled today... Netflix just keeps proving its run by pedophiles
40:20 big mouth did it
finally I'll learn if Big MOITH is truly as bad as people say it is
Is okay  mark I Moke wed to
Yes
I applaud you and your editor especially (watching it for hours) for sitting through this monstrosity. Nick kroll's parents are billionaires so i think they might be paying Netflix extra to keep it on the air.   As a completionist, i even watched the entirety of big bang theory, but this was so gross in every form and unfunny that I had to stop after a few episodes. Tbh, who is this really for? It's age-restricted content for actual teenagers and adults don't want a puberty lecture. Kids who see it without their parental permission are viewers, i guess?
You know, season six has gave me more appreciation for season three and four when I thought "eh its not bad but its not good, kinda all right" but season six is bad
44:00 love the streets of rage music
2:20 Facts
the waffle house has found its new host
Yes
The show is bad and that’s what makes it funny and good just like South Park
big maurth?
Big mouth? More like BEAN mouth! Lol
Actually frustrated that a show about puberty, which came out when I was 12, ended up being the exact opposite of what I was/am into now.
Damn right it is! Big mouth sucks! 😠 👎
Crazy I was 100% convinced Andrew was actually the main character tbh
Ok I really did not like big mouth but the show that just focused on the monsters was great cause they actually tied themes together and barley touched on the kids.
"Im going through changeeeeeesssss"
Mark: “not that I would know” *is smoking a blunt while reading script*
This art style makes me very uncomfortable.
It's straight ass cheeks. They had a unique premise and executed it horribly.
F is for family is that bad to look at for you?  man you must have the eyes of a wine tester. beauty IS in the eye of the beholder... you do you.
I like the redesign it looks way more expensive in a good way
As you said it's already a popular show. So why does it need protection from people who don't like it?
I love the new design! It will take some time to get used to, but it looks so much better!
what's wrong with F is for family's artstyle? i thought it looks ok? i mean, yeah, it's nothing special, but compared to Big Mouth's style it's damn Mona Lisa
Yes it is that bad
Did... did the animations upgraded? Damn it look smooth
I cant lie i was a contribute to the big mouth fame. It did get hella weird dont get me wrong its sun u gotta watch with the right homies for some laughs but its cuz at the time it was mad relatable like the awkwardness. But i was in high skool at the time so the mental between 13 year old me and 20 year old me is mad different. So like idk i has a reason to kinda like the show it was weird teenage humor that was relatable with how kids behaved. But tryin to rewatch it in my adulthood im jus like tf im i watchin😂
Do futurama, in my opinion it's not that bad 😁
Gotta say I'm digging Mark's new artstyle. Feels more like it's his own.
Can’t forget the fire that they caused with the movie that shall not be watched by any of us. Cuties 🤢
Oh hey! Didn’t know they put an asexual character in this show. Cool!
Netflix is stupid they lost a really good show inside job
the demographic for this is kind of weird? also the gross out humor is a big turnoff
Watching it just feels so disgusting and musty
Liking the new sprites man. Very strong shapes and colours. Can see Stephen Silver vibes
What’s the track at 36:29?
In all fairness to the 4th wall breaks of the first season, it was made in 2017. When those kind of jokes were popular, but not as saturated.
bro that thumbnail jumpscared me😭
Boy, I really don’t like nick Kroll.
big mouth is genuinely my favorite show ever. it definitely has its flaws, but i find the characters & relationships to be incredibly heartwarming & well-written. despite its silliness & hit-or-miss comedy, there is so much heart to it. i know the internet hates it a lot, but i need this show to continue for the sake of my happiness at this point, so i'm glad critics typically rate it highly lol
Yes but I’m entertained I’m ngl
i just found out people hate this show, mostly because after i watch a season. i don't think about it until next season lmao, i didn't know there was discourse. i really liked human resources, being able to focus on the monster aspects with vignettes of different characters opens up possibilities. like there was a character who's depression kitty seemed to run his body, vs his partner, whose love bug it was, and i thought that was a cool way of showing how people are different but can be compatible
38:35 Nobody cares who does the voice of a cartoon character and for anyone to change this because of race is a spineless coward.  You know how I came to that conclusion?  The trailer for "The Problem With Apu" had a lower ratio of dislikes on YouTube than a video where FRED PHELPS THANKED GOD FOR THE SHOOTING OF A CONGRESSWOMAN.    I have never heard of a single black person in my life who said they cared about who voiced who.  So Nick Kroll is okay with showing naked children but not a white person doing a black kid's voice?  That's embarrassing.  If I had watched every episode of "Big Mouth", I would have stopped watching the show, because it's stupid for anyone to care.  I have more respect for people who think video games cause violence than those people.  They are ACTORS AND ACTRESSES DOING ROLES.  Are you saying we should hire real serial killers to voice serial killers?  It's beyond stupid.  Neil Patrick Harris plays straight guys all the time and I don't give a s**t.  You have absolutely no evidence WHATSOEVER that the voices of cartoon characters make you racist.  NOT ONE DATA POINT OF EVIDENCE.
no.
Love the updated avatar
i can completely understand the hatred for big mouth. but as somebody who went through the age range that those kids went through as the show went on, i kind of found a weird comfort in it. sure, at times it's obviously trying to be shocking in order to get more people talking about it, and i completely believe it wouldn't be nearly as well received if it didn't feature big names. it's also ugly as hell.  there are times when it tries desperately to be just as absurd as other adult animations, but the difference is that shows like south park are aware of the absurdity and can mostly separate the absurdity from moments where they're actually trying to make a point. there's a difference between south park making an entire episode about kanye being a gay fish, and  big mouth randomly throwing in some weird and unfunny bit in the middle of a serious moment. from a writing stance, big mouth is bad. but i believe, for me at least, that the cartoon can feel a little bit comforting and make things seem a little less lonely, at least in the earlier seasons. i have no idea why, maybe it's my dumb little adhd  brain taking bright colors, a dumb art style, and bad pacing and just begging for more, but i still somewhat enjoyed watching it. i'm sure when i get older and look back on this show i'll find it extremely immature and awful, but for now, it's kind of comforting to see that representation and uncomfortable moments that are normally taboo in real life also here's a list of my least favorite big mouth bits 1. ladybug 2. pillow stuff. i get they're trying to be funny but PLEASE explore jay's sexuality through something that isn't him screwing pillows. 3.jay and lola being gross 4.andrew and his cousin 5. meta jokes 6. all of its on-the-nose crap
Love the new character sprites, dude!
I really like your new animation style!
SON WHAT IS THAT AT 3:26?!?!?!
I don't really hate big mouth but i do find it so unfair on netlix's part that they keep cancelling good animated shows that have potential and good story telling, but yet they still want to keep big mouth and giving it 6 seasons and possibly even more? it's pretty unfair.
Big mouth
ive always liked big mouth! i actually stopped watching some youtbers because i realised they were just joining bandwagons and were very hypocritical- i dont think its an emmy winner or anything but id much rather watch big mouth over chicago aunt lol
Am I the only one hearing him pronounce it "Big Marth", "Big Mart", and "Big Mithe"?
i watched only the first season a few years back, and i thought it was fine. sometimes the show was funny, sometimes it was so utterly bonkers that i couldn’t help but find it entertaining. can’t remember much of it though.
The Thumbnail made me gag
What is Netflix's deal with sexualising children 🤢
I'll admit that the quality has gone down in later seasons, but I like to watch the show because it's so different. Sure, it has meta jokes and follows some basic Family Guy and Simpsons elements, but as far as adult content goes, it's much different than what you'd expect. This show is one of the very few to go to those crood places that are a part of growing up and just living in general. It's not the best, and it it can be annoying sometimes, but for what it is, it's not bad.
I personally love this show
Boss baby back in business has more seasons than inside job
The simply dad cameo
The Season One segment seems very similar to IHE's video. It's probably a coincidence but some of the edits, observations and clips are straight out of that video
Thank you mark for validating my love of f is for family
This was a interesting break down of the show. I did notice you kinda very rarely talked about Missy. She is my favorite character and feel she has been wasted alot in the show. But I think of all the characters she is the most realistic and genuinely nice person of the group.
I can confidently say that a laser pointer has cured my depression
F is for Family honestly looks better than most adult animated shows. The bar is that low.
It's weird being surrounded by all the hate for this show when this is probably me and my wife's favorite show on Netflix 💀💀💀 we think it's hilarious (it really caters to our wild and chaotic sense of humor), we think it's relatable (obviously not all of the hyperbolic or insane stuff), and we think it personally fits our ideal balance between consistency for feasibility, and inconsistency for the sake of humorous subversion.   (:  <3
yes, yes it is bad
The worst thing about this show is its missed potential, it sounded like such a cool idea but they wasted it.
The hormone monster is a metaphor. They create the backstory and stuff for fun what the kid is imagining the story of the monster is.
Yes.
Is it me or this is my favorite show?
LS Mark should make an adult comedy animation cartoon series
The canceling doesnt matter to me so much, it's that it's an adult comedy that features sexualization of children.  It just leaves me feeling too uncomfortable more than it's funny.
Hard as it is to believe for some, there are some good stories and episodes. They just recently had an episode all about different age groups of women ( age 13 to adult) dealing with first yeast infection, late bloomer with your period, self conscious about pubic hair, and having to get a c-section for medical reasons. While there is tons of unnecessary gross out humor, there are some legit laughs and nice moments.
Bro your new design looks SO FLIPPING SICK ⭐⭐
I like Big 👄.
I went into this thinking Big Mouth was bad. I left Knowing it was bad.
The hormones monstress is such a bad b man like wft why is she so fuckin hot??
I've legit never talked to anyone in real life who watched Big Mouth and disliked it (a dozen people or so, not a giant sample size of course).  I enjoy it and while it's far from my favorite animated series new episodes are one of the few reasons I keep Netflix.  But given how badly they've handled cancelling things as of late, Inside Job being a big one, it is insulting they keep renewing something like this that has kind of already hit a kind of stasis with character development of the last two seasons or so.  Early on they went fast and tackled a lot of issues teenagers do (to a very exaggerated extent of course) but it's slowed down and been kind of spinning it's wheels compared to those first two seasons.
I AM A BIG MOUTH FAN 😔 I THINK ITS SILLY 💔
LS Mark at the end of your video you claim "Big Mouth is not taking the place of another animated show." I have to ask you, how you feel about Big Mouth and Chicago Party Aunt getting renewed whereas a show like Inside Job gets canceled? I have to ask how you feel about Infinity Train and more being canceled by HBO, yet Velma is renewed for a season 2? It does seem like these companies are canceling animated shows that have praise, and keeping shows that seemingly have very little merit to them.
whats the chapter switch memes song?
i have never seen that youtube account
yes.
Big Mouth may or may not be that bad, But yeah Netflix Your Lame! Dead End and Inside Job are great shows that people liked.
31:13 "new sexuality just dropped"
can we take a moment to talk about how clean marks new art style is?
I’ll save you an hour. Yes, it is in fact that bad and it appeals only to dumb people.
This man shits on everything
Marks render looks like a fish, sorry mark 😅
Yes.
Mark I love your channel, but the new style of your avatar during the video is hideous. Please consider returning to the better version.
Yes. IT IS THAT TERRIBLE.   The show is just Garbage Tier, but what's worse (Nuclear Waste Tier) is that so many better Netflix American animated shows got unfairly canned  or didn't end properly, while this was still allowed to keep going. That's what truly TERRIBLE about all of this.
53:37 Ls mark dragon ball fan confirmed?? 😳😳😳
I enjoyed the first season, laughed a bit at the second season, and was over it afterwards. One thing that truly turned me away is that the main characters don’t change whatsoever. Like if you look at Nick, Andrew and Jessie in the first and last episodes, they’re the same characters, whereas if you look at characters like Missy, or even Jay in some aspects,they changed quite a bit during the seasons and show some growth
What's With Adult Comedy's And The Big Bang Theory?
Yeah
Love the new style for the channel looks really clean but I’d say you should slow down the shapes that move in the background since it feels pretty distracting considering how fast they’re moving.
The problem with the show is that it hyper sexualizes CHILDREN, a trend Netflix seems to be embracing (Cuties for example).  It’s an adult animated series but that doesn’t change the fact that the shows protagonists are minors who have their genitals shown periodically.
I don’t think that shouldn’t get more seasons, but when shows like inside job are renewed and then Netflix is like, “ Lol nah undo that” and cancels the 2nd season while saying that another season of big mouth is good it breaks my heart. both of these shows can exist on the same platform I just wish that they’d stop axing the other.
Hey Mark. Didn't watch your stupid video. To answer your question: Yes.
27:36 real
This might be the most "millennial" show I've ever seen.
So that whole bit about animation fans being hypocritical, isn't that being kinda vague and unhelpful?   It already feels like a strawman to say people were demanding big mouth be cancelled. Cause was there and it was largely people just pointing out why they think it's bad, and how it's weird it's lasted this long.   And it's fine to point that out. If you don't like a show and don't see anyone else even across the internet actually enjoying it, but are told it's doing gangbusters...people will point that out. It's not as if projects being kept alive by a fan at the network is unheard of. Also yes money and resources are limited so it's not direct but Big mouth is taking up space another show could. We'll never be able to know.
Hmmm your old character art was better ngl :/
Thanks for going through this so we dont have to. I couldn't bring myself to watch it, so I'm just gonna listen to this vid while I play elden ring.
idk why but whenever i look at the art style  i just have the urge to do violence
It's the most critically acclaimed cartoon of all time.  The second season has a 100% rating on RottenTomatoes with 33 positive and zero negative reviews.
Yes it is that bad imo
The Sonic mix for background music kept me glued...
Liking the new look. A good a shake up and a good video, 2 for 2! Banger as always
I truly enjoy big mouth. It gets good laughs outta me but at this point I'm just invested with the story and characters. Sure it's insanely over the top sometimes but in terms of what big mouth has to offer when it comes to puberty and what happens during it would've been so nice to have. If the serious bits could stay serious it would help the show. The spin-off show Human Resources is better than Big Mouth (the episode about loss and grief was one of the saddest things I've ever seen)
Matt is one of the genuinely good characters they have in this show. They actually created a real character with development
im sorry but why do you say big mouth as big marth
I don't think I've ever thought about this show besides the eyes being super creepy looking
love the new avatar
11:23 Wait, wait, wait... Legitimate question. Nick is the MC? I literally did not know that's what they intended.
I always thought that Caleb should have been the head of human resources that would have been a great twist
The fact it's still going is just a kick in the head for what could have been an interesting concept. They really took what could have been the next south park in terms of mixing a coming of age story along with comedy and adult humor and basically just turned it into "Woah we can show kid dick on tv because it's a CARTOON!?!?! SEX FUNNY!!!! OVEREXPLAINING JOKE = EPIC FUNNY CRINGE?????" It almost feels like it's baiting people into talking about it just for the sake of getting attention which is just sad. South Park did wacky stuff because that's just what was funny. Constantly showing cartoon child genitals with no actual joke is not funny. It's just weird. And it feels like a desperate attempt to trend on twitter. (A common trait among shitty adult animation)
I honestly like the show it's not a serious show no... but I think everyone can enjoy a certain amount of dumb humor atleast and since I don't watch family guy and other shows like that I'm able to get my dumb comedy out of this show which again bot great but way better than family guy and its millions of clone shows.  Also this show won't go until nick Kroll is over it cause he's a billionaire and can pay for everything himself so Netflix has no reason to remove it cause they can just air it and only gain benefit from whomever is watching it without putting their own money at risk
Yes. Next video.
19:30 the full scene is actually even weirder, iirc the hormone monster says “well we could probably get away with it if it’s animated”
I’m in too deep now I have to watch a new season when it comes out to justify the hours wasted watching this show. I don’t particularly enjoy it but it’s background noise with no substance and I guess I’m fine with that.
its possible other people like stuff you dont. what i find baffling is the criticism online for velma when i think big actually did the stuff velma is accused of way more and way worse
My man used the TotallyNotMark outro theme… COINCIDENCE?
6:43 oh god that would be chaos, every kid being able to wish for something would be chaos, and they'd have to keep teleporting everywhere
Do Supernatural PLEASE
0:24
It's not "big mouth is taking the place of another cartoon" or "it should be canceled too"... Well for the most part, you know what with the explicit material. But anyways, it's about how it doesn't make sense if you're going to keep funding a show like big mouth, why wouldn't you support other shows that are consistently high quality, hace a huge following, and don't focus on a preteens singing privates
Did mark change art styles, feels different. I kinda like it.❤
I was sort of worried about your new channel art, but then when I look at it more it doesn't look that bad, I actually like it.
Ok you care way more about the rules than the show expects you to but fine I'll bite:  The Monsters can see each other but can only be seen by humans if they choose to be, generally when they're with the human they're assigned to they're not seen by anyone else and if two of the humans who have the same monster are in the same place they'll turn Invisible to one when talking to the other. In extreme circumstances they can make themselves visible to talk to humans they weren't assigned to but it's frowned upon by their employers and a Monster getting romantically involved with a human is a firable offence.  That was all very obvious to me from the start but also throwaway jokes are a thing in this show so you don't need to take it that seriously. Don't create Plot Holes where there are none,  you're worse than the Doctor Who fans.
Its not as bad as Brickleberry etc  it has entertaining moments but its not great...
30:28 Average Tuesday in Alabama
the only good celebrity cartoon would definitively have to be Mike Tysons show
I liked this show; the seasons when they where at the park helped me going on during a month of work
I wish to GOD I had this show as a kid. Growing up in the deep south with no internet and a holy roller family made for a very confusing and tumultuous puberty...I'm kind of surprised I didn't turn out to be like the guy from Scream...😅
i havent watched your last video but i gotta say that artstyle change is great! love it.
lola is far from annoying
big marth
idk, i think the 4th wall being loose is kinda part of why cartoons are so fun.
Yes
At this point, I wouldn't even acknowledge the existence of rotten tomatoes critics score
It's just a very uninteresting show. The problem with big mouth is that it. Just. Never. Ends. And it's eating other animated cartoons that are way better
dawg wtf is that background music.
It looks gross. Any silver lining this may have is outshined by how ugly it looks. I don't understand how such ugly looking shows get approved.
I genially don’t care if the show is good. It might as well have the writing quality of Arcane, but the art style is horrible. I can’t watch a show that hurts my eyes.
Fun fact: the reason why big mouth has such a high ratings is because Netflix bot the ratings
I have never watched a single episode of this show but,   I don't know why but i just feel super creepy, cuties-like pedo vibes from this show  maybe it's because of the show art style or something, but i just don't feel right looking at this show it just feels like this show has some unnecessary sexual undertones   I don't know why I feel this way, but i think the target audience for this show is some creepy millionaire who has a creepy fetish & a lot of free time on his hands
It's just sad because the show has so much potential which has been wasted.
I feel like the biggest issue with this show is that it's all about how puberty changes the kids. But we never see the kids before going through puberty so we always accociate them as awkard hormonal assholes
I'm pretty sure the "who can see Hormone Monster" rules is basically like the same rules on who can hear Stewie talk.  One character all the time then whoever else when it's needed for a joke
Currently watching this in a hotel by the ocean now edit now in a zoo will update when I get home
FUCK that thumbnail
I started watching Inside Job a few weeks ago. Im sad that it was cancelled, and I did think that a show like Big Mouth is not as good and should be cancelled. However after watching this I have to accept the facts, Big Mouth is really popular and that is not gonna change
i didn’t need an hour long video to  know that yes. this show sucks
yo i wasnt expecting those knew mark illustration lmao
Im just not gonna even finish this vid😴
yes
I dunno if you're looking for feedback or not, but I personally am not a fan of your new character design artstyle change
RICKY AND MORTY NEXT?
Yes. No need to thank me.
Voice actors being changed based on real life race and not actual talent or respect for the character is a blight on the industry. If you want more minority roles, great! Do it for new characters. At least in this instance the new voice was actually better but the intent was still artistically bankrupt.
"Cells at work code black" has an amazing episode about smoking. Very accurate.
When I was watching this (out of pure curiosity I swear) I thought Andrew WAS the main character, I thought that all the way up until the show directly told me Nick was supposed to be the main character
43:10 I want to show this specific part to a forum full of gym bros
Have a look at blockbuster
Wait, you complained about how YouTube is censoring your monetization and then release a video on Big Mouth?! I mean I am watching it but still.   Enjoy your engagement  Edit: You called out the Meta joke!
I don‘t think it‘s an very abysmal show. i thought it‘s more messy due to how it‘s like left and right happening and the execution itself for this show. with some bad meta humor and gross out humor. It could have done better if it‘s not overusing it or less or researching it right about the topic.  You can blame netflix about cancellations to few better and good shows. But i don‘t think the creator to this show was responsible just because of the cancellation to few shows. Creators didn‘t do anything  that‘s Netflix Fault forcing to keep it going.
Whaaat? I thought F is for Family looks pretty nice. I don't think it's a Van Gogh, but it's totally not bad looking at all. L take.
Damn the new caracter looks worse
As an asexual person who doesn't like meta humor, none of this show appealed to me. At all.  Even when they did add an asexual character, I could not care less about him
Tbh im just watching this because of the new mark 'sprites'
Just saying, when there are shows like these I'd rather them keep working on this show then move over to one I want to watch, lol.
fucking hate this ugly unfunny ass show, cant believe they think they’re above big bang theory, gross
Big Mouths is an easy punching bag when good animated shows get canceled because it's an adult animated show like Family Guy or The Simpsons whose audience isn't fans of animation. Fans of animation can point it out as an animated show that has a wide appeal but in reality isn't very good and ask, "why does this show that is good get canceled but Big Mouths gets another season" when whatever show they're talking about doesn't have a large audience even though it is rated very highly. It's part of the larger problem that any animated show that isn't "raunchy" is still considered something for kids and get written off before being given a chance by audiences and executives. At the end of the day Big Mouths is a staple show on Netflix that gets people to keep their subscriptions and that is all they care about.
Actually, the misconception is that they don't basically just do abortions, cause they do. They have tricks to lie about it.
This could be the greatest show on Netflix, but I just can't get past the god awful art style.
Ja
this video shouldve just been this man saying the word yes and then it ends
Ngl. I think the awkwardness of the characters design works well with the show. I'm not the biggest fan of big mouth, but as a person with conservative family... This is a way to help open up discussion
Lean how to day house.
The new artstyle is lit
I wanted to point out that the kid who saw another kid's hormone monster is very possibly on the autism spectrum. Throughout the entire series he has amazing insight and is very blunt with words. He is also very creative in creating a comic book with all the characters as superheroes. That being said I wouldn't be surprised if someome with his abilities would be able to see something like a hormone monster.
I have always hated this show right from episode one and, after watching this review nothing has changed for me. I am still left wondering why a show that is basically teetering on the presuppose of child porn is still around?🤔
Man... I really need to watch Uncle Grandpa again.
Yeah I don’t get why this show was green lit the way it was tbh. To me, they Dragon Ball GT’d it…a few really good ideas, absolutely terrible execution.
Big Marth?
I've laughed only once at this show and yet I've seen every season, watched the spin-off, and will probably keep watching until either I stop caring or it's over. Why? No clue, you tell me.
I can't believe Nick Kroll invented puberty
Big mouth gave me a funny porn parody so that's fun.
Why do you look so ugly now
New art style look sticky 👎😡 change=bad!
Some good episodes but some terrible ones too. Very inconsistent show.
So the answer is, yes it is. Big mouth's few redeeming qualities are under mountains of actual garbage. And when in a few years the series finally croaks, it will be forgotten. Comparing it to any other big animated series, the only cultural impact this show has is people's disgust toward it.
Haha u rly reviewed ugly show with your new uglyfied cartoon persona. I love your humor <3
If everybody just stop watching this piece of shit of a show it also would get canceled. So in the favor of everyone just ignore it
Big mouth ls mark agrivates me and makes me want to be extremely violant
23:35 was so fucking absurd it actually made me chuckle a bit
100% on rotten tomatoes just shows  Everyone That reviews for rotten tomatoes is a Pedophile( or just got paid off lmao)
One thing I particularly enjoy yet hate is how disgusting and genuinely repulsive Andrew and his character gets. Like to the point where it’s not even funny it’s just uncomfortable BUT he’s voiced by John Mulaney and I’m not a big fan of him so playing Andrew almost comes off like a punishment for him lol
plss watch human resources
Like the new artstyle
I had a roommate at university who would fall asleep with this playing on netflix on his laptop almost every night, this was either before the "are you still watching" prompt popped up....or he disabled it just to be that guy
Japan gets shit on for being weird with its young animated characters but then this type of shit exists in the west, and they're drawn even more like kids.  Anime isn't innocent but holy hell at least it's main focus is usually on fight scenes and world building, not animated CP
It's not that Big Mouth is bad that is making people mad, it's the fact that this show has so many seasons already with more to come, meanwhile on-par or even better Netflix originals are getting put down before making it past one season. Tall Girl is allowed a sequel, Kissing Booth is an entire trilogy now, and 365 Days is ALSO a trilogy, meanwhile Inside Job doesn't get the same treatment.   It also doesn't help that the 2nd season was in mid-development when it was cancelled, it's like your parents buying you an Xbox for Christmas and mid-opening it they go "lmao nvm, selling that to get you some clothes instead.".
Love your new art
I'm still upset by Inside Job getting pulled it really had potential. But Big Mouth got more seasons is the most awful atrocity.
Maybe I don't get the humor but for me it's just boring and kinda disgusting sometimes
ngl you should do the Big Bang theory
I don't hate the show, it can get some good laughs, especially with Murry the hormone monster! Personally, I just hate the human the character designs. Many look weird and  ugly!  It's like giving a lower body part eyes and lips! YUCK!😝
Yes
The Boondocks season 4 accurately depicts smoking weed
would you seriously want a kid narrarating this show or something?💀
thank you for praising f is for family!🔥
Oh nice, LS Mark’s look got a facelift
new profile picture sucks, unsubbed
1:37 with "most places" you mean Twitter?
I like the new style
I don't really like when media tries to show what it's like to be high, specifically on marijuana.
I love this show hoping for many more seasons to come
I completly forgot this show existed
Short answer: Yes.
My dad and his wife genuinely love this show but I personally can't stand it. The artstyle is putrid and I don't care for the jokes. I'm very well aware it's about puberty but the sexual situations they put the child characters through make me really uncomfortable. I grew up with South Park and they don't treat their child characters that way (plus they actually sound like kids). South Park has its problems but atleast it's not Big Mouth.
It's not just about shitting on Big Mouth because we think it's taking the spotlight of other shows, it's how a show about puberty and hormones stays when a show with a deep story line and that is not a spin off gets thrown out
Woah love the new logo and sprites
Big mouth is a show that I would point out really good scenes and that’s it cause the rest is to disgusting and bad to acknowledge, also it’s 100% not Big Mouths fault they are the only animated show Netflix respects but man I’m bitter how this can constantly get renewed but actual good shows with decent to huge fanbases get canned
WoW!, i really love the new pfp and stills of your avatar made by matthew bitts!!
i actually did appreciate the asexual character because it's something things almost never talked about in television. It's nice to see a character especially a young character struggling with something I've struggled with.
I love the new aspect you gave to your videos
I actually stopped watching midway through season 5. Seems like this was a good call.
BRO I CAN'T, THESE FREAKIN ADULT SHOW ART-STYLE. Where's the hell people's originality gone? When you creating cartoon, what is the problem to make an unusual style? Like the FOP did, or Total Drama
I cant believe I think I just recognized the Sonic Rush OST in a Big Mouth video essay
Yes
Every time u referenced inside jobs cancellation i winced in pain
Im just out here waiting for Netflix to animate the new season of Baki that's been in production for like a year now
short answer: yes long answer: yeeeeees
short answer: yes long answer: yeeeeees
I've watched enough of it to definitively say: It's shit
I like big mouth and i've talked to others at work who like it and... No one likes the pillows! I think the creator likes the pillows.  It's one of those shows where you ignore the things you don't like.
47:57 did they really copy Doug Walker?
"Watch Big Mouth first before you decide to shit on it!"  Mark: okay
I saw one 4 minutes of it and I couldn’t take it after that. I went to watch clips of it to see if it got better but it didn’t. I don’t know how people can like this show.
im typing this at the start of the video just to see how far i get before being fed up with the art style and give up  tune it later to see how far i make it
It sorta is
The sooner we _cancel_ it, the sooner we can move on from it.
Have you ever thought about going over Bojack Horseman? It’s one of my favorite shows of all time
THIS is how I find out Inside Job WAS CANCELED?!
I was very against the show when it came out because I thought while puberty is relatable and objectively hilarious, it sexualized kids too much. I eventually started watching because a bunch of people told me to give it a chance. It has its moments where it’s absolutely hysterical but I really really don’t want or need to see children doing that, even if it’s “just a cartoon”
Iv always avoided it cause it was an ugly adult humor based show in a  high school while not being from Japan so it's weirder. But seeing a couple episodes and then other reviews stopping near the pregnant pillow i just knew it would never have been for me
I think it would be better if the hormone monster worked like ryuk from deathnote lol. something only that person can see but maybe if something happens (like they kiss someone or knowing this show fuck them) they can see each other’s monsters.
I really like the way they portrayed Mathew as a pansexual person that likes guys more.
I've been depressed all my life Mark and lemme tell ya, a laser pointer? It helps
What is that ending music? I keep looking for it.  I know Totally not mark uses it.
I… don’t think anyone says you shouldn’t hate on someone because they worked hard on it. There are bigoted cartoons that have a lot of work put into them that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t hate on them
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES AND A THOUSAND TIMES HELL YEA
Why does this ugly ass show have SO many seasons?!
seeing hyper realistic mark is kinda creepy
Wait the sponsorship isn’t manscaped? I feel betrayed
Watching this review (I'm half way through) and it reminds me more and more why I loved this show so much
Aye I like that he improved the look of his lil character
So I saw that my brother is watching this and it scares me to think that he is going to learn about puberty and everything that comes with it from this stupid show.
The new look on your avatar isn’t really pleasing to me
27:39 totally thought you were gonna say "idk I don't have depression" and cuz of what I expected your joke caught me so off guard I laughed way harder than it deserved lmao
Well, my opinion is unchanged. Big mouth is still garbage, probably worse than Velma tbh
Yes, yes it is.
22:57 not much
Might want to change your character logo because every time I see it causes a negative reaction.
Yeah ti can be a ok show at times
they just kept making everyone on the show lesbians for no reason
big mouth is excellent.
Short answer yes
Yup
Dude. It's a show for PEDOPHILES. It's not that fucking deep .    If you like it, you should be on a list. That's all I gotta say.
SLENDERMAN
Alot  my friends like  this show but I couldn't  get into so I thought  something was  wrong with me  or I'm just be to negative . Finally   someone  understand  me  brv
Let’s be honest tho F is for Family CLEARS Big Mouth
You're a hero, may we never forget you countless sacrifices man.
cosmo and wander
Why crap on a show when you can just not watch it? That’s what I do.
Dragon ball music at the end threw me off😂
I feel like mark is going through puberty too with those long limbs 👀
Things I hated about it - scenes focus too long on nudity  -everything with pillows -Nicks grandpa and his storyline  - season 2+ Andrew -future episodes Things I liked  - jessi  -jessi’s dad - the way they handled divorce -Mathew  -ally - missy ( at certain points) -the Christian boy missy likes
Not gonna watch this video, just wanted to say that anyone why says Big Mouth is a bad show is a tasteless clod
Anyone wondering “why does this keep getting more seasons?” Just look who made it, sorry, say it’s antisemitic, but it’s odd that pedofilic shows made by Jews are promoted, highly rated, and rewarded, while popular shows made by any other race are lucky to get a green light in the first place let alone a second season
Show is too woke
I really wanna hear what Mark has to say but god fucking dammit is it hard to look at Big Mouth's art style
Wait inside job in caneld?
In all honesty if you watch human resources first and then watch big mouth it's a way better fukin show. I tried to watch Big mouth a while ago and I could not get into it. It was so fucking stupid. Human resources came out and just fucking WOW. IT WAS WAY BETTER! ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT AREN'T ANSWERED IN BIG MOUTH are answered in human resources. It makes SOOOO much more sense. Try it watch human resources than go to big mouth total game chanher
Yes
The Caleb joke is that he's the only one that can see other people's hormone monster cus he's autistic (or has some other disorder)
big maurth
You gonna do Velma?
Never heard of this show, but all I've learned 5 minutes into this video is Youtube allows pillow vagina.
i REALLY love the new avatar stills the style is super nice and feels super fun and expressive
I've not watched a single episode of Big Mouth, but I must admit that I paused this video thirty minutes in to say that I find the Hormone Monstress attractive.  O_O
The show has...mostly ehhh  But there's a few moments that are smart and heartwarming but it's like 5% of the show And that care came with the later seasons also paired with more nasty gross out jokes. So it's not "better" I have no idea what's going on lmao
Watching this I have come to the same conclusion I did when I watched the show myself. It’s literally the definition of mid yes mid, below average dare I say mediocre
Nice new art
this show to me is just a big budget pubertina from shut up cartoons its not great but it serves as good background noise for when im like doing the dishes or something
This is how I discovered inside job was canceled, I am incredibly sad now
It just looks ugly, so I never watched it. Doesn't sound like I missed much.
Big mouth is the biggest excuse of cp I’ve ever seen and really doesn’t need another 5 seasons
Yes.
No, it's not.
Human Resources is objectively better than Big Mouth
I just gotta say that I love the new talk sprites and the background, looks much cleaner and vibrant  also wow, I knew the show was crass in some regards, but I didn't know it was this uncomfortably extreme. Definitely going to give it a pass
Only The Hormone Monstress matters. Everything else on Big Mouth can go to Hell for real.
I REALLY wanna know what your new outro music is, it is phenomenal
off topic (?) but i adore the cat edits you put into some of the clips
I really like the new avi!!
I'll say this about Big Mouth while no where near as good as F is For Family however I find it funnier than Family Guy. While not all of the jokes land at least they tried. With the exception of the random musical moments they actually a lot better than Family guys.
Season 1 of Big mouth was good, but I just found the vulgar humour cringe, after the first season at a certain point
I don't think I'd mind the surrealism so much if they solidified the fact that it is ...I dunno ... like something adjacent to how Inside Out or Psychonauts ha characters representing emotions or aspects of the human psyche. Instead of just this nonsense complicated world building.   The nudity type shit is definitely a huge no no to me too. I know that a large part of puberty is haha sex, but I feel like this is a line where maybe the writers should have relied on context clues more. This just feels like edgy for the sake of edgy.  These two things (and the horrid art style but I can forgive that if a show is well written) really hold this back for me. It is a shame, because it does seem like they are making an effort towards exploring diversity in how children grow up and the different problems they face. But oof ... it sure is rough.  Kudos to you for giving it a try though. Sometimes you come across as a little curmudgeon-y, so I was curious to see how you tackle this beast of a show.
Simpsons South Park and family guy all actually started out well mark
I just find this show disturbing
The fact that big mouth has 100% critic score but Velma doesn't makes no fuckin sense, they're the same show when it comes to fourth wall breaking meta humor. Just shows how hypocritical critics are
What accent does this guy have that the only word he cant enunciate is "mouth?"
I’m convinced a disproportionate amount of pedophiles worked on this show. Nothing can convince me otherwise
Big mouth is garbage, but I'll hear you out
I cant wait to be rich someday so i can pay mark, and whoever works with him at the time, to make a video about Action League Now. A dumb nickelodeon show that aired in at like 2 or 3 in the morning. Shit used to make me laugh as a kid cause i was delirious from lack of sleep.
i think bigmouth was designed to be watched by people who have autism. that's just me though.
I have kind of a love hate relationship with this show. Like I dislike a lot of things about it but I have a sort of morbid curiosity that keeps making me watch the new seasons. Also I've become kind of attached the characters and wanna see what happens to them (regretfully). I do think it would be much better without a lot of its supernatural elements. Also there's a lot of things about it that gross me out (obviously) that I wish I had never seen. I do like that they talk abut a lot of issues that I've never seen discussed in tv shows before, but they don't always handle them well. Also a personal opinion, I like that they had Jay and Matthew get together but its really annoying that they broke up before the end of the season basically out of nowhere? I thought they were one of the better couples in the show but ig we can't have anything nice.
Meta humour was good because it was infrequent it was a wink to the audience and you felt good about noticing it. Now it's just something big and unrealistic happens? A character HAS to make a comment they HAVE to. Meta humour is good but mainstream killed it. For a series like scream it works tho imo scream is still the right amount of meta
Yes
Big mouth is really amazing. I love the show, especially when it's based around sexual education and especially because I wanted you to be a sex, therapist, coach or educator and want people to understand that sex is part of life and everybody should do it. Yes, great a show ever of all time. Also love human resources.
Yes it is.
Meta humor has ruined itself by becoming to meta like mark said it comes off as cheap and lazy
💙
naw disagree
I just realised that the hormone monster's nose is supposed to be a
I disagree with the people that say can't criticise animation because it took a long time to make/"is a miracle it even exists". If it's ugly and bad. It was a waste of fucking time and the effort doesn't matter it doesn't make it any better. If I spent years of my life building a house that stands up and does its job but blows over with the slightest gust of wind. Guess what? It was a bad fucking house. If you want animation to be held to the same standard as movies they have to be allowed to be criticised to the same standard. It's either a genre or it's not you can't have it both ways
Tbh idk why the show gets so much crap. It's realistic to anyone who's already gone through puberty and comforts young people going through their own awkward stage plus it actually teaches people about the anatomy of bodies and the idea of gender identity racial socialism and much more all wrapped in a joke. I see why people didn't like it at first the show was ROUGH the first 3 seasons but after that it awarded to really flesh out the characters and give each main and secondary character their own spotlight unlike many other shows that kept anyone who wasn't main just as background and comic relief
Imo the fact that it looks like ass is the only reason it gets away with showing a third of what it does because it's like a "buffer"
44:39. Casually stealing a joke from mumkey jones
I think he forgot that the show wasn’t really trying to tell a sincere story.
4:13 AND Professor Poopypants from the Captain Underpants movie.
The worst thing for me is that netflix shows when cancelled are like contracted to netflix still so they can't even bring it to another production company until a certain amount of time(this is what I heard about Santa Clarita diet and I might be misinformed)
LS Mark can you please chance the sensor sound it hurts my ears.
43:24 The third treatment of depression is laser points obviously. Did you already forget?
NEXT UP: A Human Resources Review!
why are you bleeping out "sex"
How does this happen? Kroll is elite establishment that pushes propaganda.
I personally prefer the old artstyle
LS Mark buddy, love ya (you make good content) but id rather fight and die than roll over and accept big mouth
This but no inside job?
Idk I loved it maybe this is just Canada but everyone I know thinks it’s hilarious
38:02 Mark idk if you intended this but I legit had to rewind this bit three times because I just couldn't believe that what I was hearing and seeing was real  What the fuck
38:02 brian
the good die young, the bad get 7 seasons
Season 4 where the white voice actor can’t say the n word as missy bring up the good question on whether or not the same standards apply to both jobs. Does a voice actor have to get immersed. And if so, why are actors who play certain characters allowed to say such words but voice actor may not.
Ah yes… Anything with black people is Wakanda.
I'm glad that the people who made this got financial support for their effort at least.
Man I love big mouth it’s just not for y’all so don’t watch it simple
love the new sprites and background!
great video :) I too enjoy watching media with a critical eye, but somehow this show is like giving my brain junk food. I hate to admit that I've watched it more than I should have, but what can I say I've rewatched the first 8 seasons of family guy more than I can count.
You really should check out the spin off it’s better in all ways
wait what? They really cancelled Inside Out but not this? What the actual f is that?
as a teen my friend and i would watch big mouth and a lot of the stupid humor got us ngl but i always HATED the pillow scenes and super graphic stuff. they could have toned it down i dont blame ppl for hating it. cant watch the newer seasons lol
Thank you for bringing up how people are using the cancellation of animated shows to shit on big mouth like I get it sucks that your favorite animated show got canceled but that’s not a reason to shit on somebody else’s hard work just because you don’t like it
The fact that this show still exists but Inside Job doesnt baffles me.
Honestly the seasons are either a hit or a miss but I enjoy the stories yea the show is nasty but that doesn’t mean nasty shows haven’t gotten popular or cancelled but the idea is just overdone but they add more things into it than some other shows I hope they continue Human Resources to
The change in art style is dumb change it back
Honestly, I do like it to a point. Unfortunately like other adult animations it thinks it needs to be raunchy to be funny/has a fugly art style.  The only real character(s) I like though is connie and mona(?)  The coming of age idea feels just so..over done. I think the spin off( human resources) is so much better.
Big Mouth is a show I watch to see how deep into the depths of depravity it can go and my god... I am stunned every single season. Like it's so... so misguided in the "lessons" it tries to teach.  Like there's this one storyline where Andrews girlfriend, Bernie, is hanging out with a friend and Andrew gets jealous so he goes to see her to reaffirm that they're "okay" and it's played up that he's being hysterical and overreacting when she's just hanging out with a friend.  So Andrew finally gets to the house and confronts the "Guy friend" and accuses him of being in love with Bernie, Bernie calls him ridiculous to which the guy friend turns around and says "actually I do love you", so Bernie breaks up with Andrew on the spot and those two get together. Which just validated how the main character was feeling despite him up to this point being portrayed to be a psycho for thinking that Bernie had feelings for her guy friend when at the end of the episode it's confirmed she does and always has and clearly was just looking for an excuse, which Andrew handed her.  This isn't to say I sympathise with Andrew. I hate all the characters, but I especially hate Nick and his Parents, why do I hate his parents? Because they were content to let a bunch of barely pubescent children attempt an orgy in their attic and called it "Sex positivity"... They're weird people portrayed to be good.   Oh and actually tied for first is that new baby hormone monster and Jessi... Absolutely god awful every time that little demon is on the screen I feel physical anger towards it. Jessi's new wave feminism arc where her and the baby hormone monster tried to bully her step-mother (who was simply happy to have a child of her own) into raising the baby how THEY wanted it to be raised based on their weird beliefs was gross as well.  They also talk about not assuming gender but when there's a supposed burglar they automatically assume it's a man. That's a little thing but it's just the one example I could think of in their hypocrisy (which is endless).
Should’ve gotten a manscape sponsor for this episode.
Maurth
Don't blame Big Mouth for the other shows being cancelled, blame Netflix and shareholders.
Is it really that hated? Everyone I know loves it, including myself
The character designs make me want to hurt myself and others, maybe the story is fine but I can’t ever get passed that. 1:00
please go back to The old style of your character, this new style it looks aids
Can someone tell me the song used at the end of the video? I’ve heard it in DefinitelyNotMark’s videos and have been trying to find it
I enjoyed season 1 but the story with the stupid pillow just lost me entirely and I stopped watching mostly due to that plot thread. It went from being a weird take on puberty to just how much weird s*x stuff can we put into an episode and have a thread of a plot.
Yes
I get some points you make but a lot of this review is purposely being ignorant about something in the show when it takes about 10 seconds or less to think to figure it out
Spongebob Squarepants is Nickelodeon's cash cow. Big Mouth is the same for netflix.  If your carton doesn't bring in the numbers like Those cartoons, it will more than likely be killed so that the company can stay green at the end of the sales quarter.
I tried watching this show twice. It was really really not for me. I found the humor to be pretty obnoxious and a lot of it made me pretty uncomfortable. The main thing that killed it for me though are those character designs. Some characters look okay, but most hurt my eyes. I’m happy there are people who enjoy this show though. In a sea of lame and forgettable shows something worth remembering, even if bad, is a good thing.
Probably the weirdest opinion ever but....    Big mouth is the TTG of adult animation!
Im not gonna i been watching this show. I had no idea nick was the main character
I do not want to give this a chance at all, but I will for you. Ps hasn't seen the video yet
what do you have against "-ay"? why do you refuse to say it, and instead say "-eh"? ("deh", "weh", "geh", "jeh", "dismeh".)
dawg I love this show but all my favourite youtubers hate it lmao
The fact he just said Big mouth is on the same line as Simpsons, family guy, and south park burns my soul. It's so not true, those shows actually had good seasons and have been running for well over a decade. Big mouth can be cancelled its not a household name like those. Hell theres not even merch for the show.
Heck yeah another video that uses sonic rush music! What a good game with some catchy songs
I really don't want to "You need to be high IQ to get this show"  But a lot of your criticisms seem to stem from a lack of understanding, why choices were made.  Obviously the critiques about not having enough rules and being overly meta are valid because they're fairly subjective.  But, a lot of your frustration seems to come from misunderstanding.  Like the hormone monster isn't an alien, the show is suggesting that an alien banging the earth is the start of life on the planet, and once hormones became a thing so did hormone monsters.  Or how when Jessi becomes depressed you think the hormone monstress is getting fired, and why doesn't that cancel her puberty, except she isn't being fired, kitty says she's "Taking over as Jessie's number one" meaning now the biggest thing in jessie's life isn't her puberty it's her depression, so connie isn't center stage.  This happens a couple times throughout the video.  As a fan of yours and big mouth it made it seem like your view of the show was scewed because you missed certain points.  Love all your stuff and your "Every episode reviews" have gotten me through some long days.
"we should just accept that netflix is making garbage without stopping and canceling good shows" how about... no? it isn't that big mouth is being made instead of a show it's that netflix is canceling a lot of great shows but this bad to mediocre show won't stop.
big mouth isn't coming of age it's just animated cp if an animated show would be borderline illegal with real actors it shouldn't exist animated either
I’m still not sure about the new mark model. Bit to thick outlines for me but non problem with trying new things
Yes
Big mouth is bad. Season 1-2 are decent, but everything after is bad, same plot, same shitty jokes, it just gets gross after season 2
please go back to the old design
IDK y but I like big mouth. For the plot and characters not the sex jokes, they’re too many it’s beyond cringe. Sex jokes are ok in moderation. And a proportionate amount of adult shows or episodes should be devoid of sex jokes entirely.
Watched half of Big Mouth, thought it was dumb, and stopped watching it.
I honestly enjoyed the first season, given I was 19 years old, but even then, the animation style was a massive turn off. Maybe im.overly picky, and I'll admit it, but some animation styles really determine my interest in a show. At this point, I doubt I'd be able to watch it fully. It fit the perfect late teens, edgy humor, but that's quickly outgrown. Fortunately for Big Mouth, in my opinion, there's a constant stream of late teens.
oh boy, can't wait to see what Mark will be overly negative and bitter about today
Bro don’t put that creepypasta shit in your videos… as a 12 am viewer it scared the shit out of me and I had to stop watching
god the season 5 finale reminds me of the ending of "To Boldly Flee" in the absolute worst way possible
Y’know, this show has it’s flaws, a lot of them, but I’m still glad that it started like right before I hit puberty, especially how sex ed is just, not very good in most schools. However I will agree that this show does not need more seasons
Hell yeah I love big mouth
Yes sir it’s terrible
,.,., 157,591-7h The time has come, you're finally talking about Big Mouth. I don't personally think it's horrible, but I do realise that it's very hard to follow in some episodes, that kind of "hard" where you don't even manage to space out but still don't get anything from it. Thanks for the video Mark, keep it up.
while it a show I don’t like at all I know canceling it won’t change anything, it just get people unemployed and Netflix won’t bring back shows that are good even if they got rid of big mouth. Like if family guy was on Netflix and the same shows that people love got canceled would there be the same anger towards family guy then there is for big mouth right now. Also this was a great video.
You should watch every episode of “Monk”, the detective procedural.  That would be really really funny.
... Something tells me I need to go back and watch this sober lmao. I've watched everything through, even the little side series twice. I thought it was wacky but relatable in some ways.
Everyone talking about Big Mouth’s design, but not Mark’s new design
F Is For Family has a nice, grounded style. It makes you feel like you're in the 70s. I think it's a good style, but it's no where near bad. If anything, calling it basic would be acceptable.
I would say the early seasons were better, however, i persoanlly really didnt like the 6th season. The reason i liked it, is cuz it was helping me to have a better understanding of puberty while being fun, the monsters and their relationships with the kids were the best part for me. But in the latest season, that doesnt exists anymore. They pretty much introduced all the monsters in the spin off series, and there is nothing fun about the kids anymore. I didnt even like the humour in the 6th season, most of it was just netflixe advertising for its other shows, or just patting itself on the back. Also i think even the writers might be bored with the show st this point? The writing its getting kinda bad, everything was quite rushed in the latest season, and it even feels like nothing had happened.
They explain in the spin of that only there clients can see them
"critics", generally have NO IDEA what they are talking about.
Me watching this video high: 👁️👄👁️
Yes.
the thumbnail is so cursed.
I find it interesting how the show’s audience is mostly older people. It seems that the ones who relate to it are those who are 10+ years past puberty. People actually going through or fresh out of puberty tend to just find it gross and weird. I believe it’s because the show isn’t actually a relatable depiction of puberty; it’s a hyperbolic parody of vague memories. Most people’s experience with puberty is nothing like big mouth, but after a while their memories become exaggerated and warped. My mom used to like big mouth until she realized it was more focused on shock humor than actually depicting puberty. It coincided with her reading her childhood diary and realizing how much she’d misremembered or forgotten.
This show switches from preachy as fuck to the most degenerate した
Fart censorship is too distracting
Glad to see mark's avatar entered the adventure era
I really hate this show....that being said its like a carcrash, I just cannot look away
Charles Bradley was a legendary singer, please everyone go listen to his music.

Still to much child "paragraphy"
I can understand your opinion on the show, but the lack of actually talking about the female characters was sending me during your whole review. The fact that you have trouble saying the word vagina tells me all I need to know about your opinion honestly. I understand that the general public especially men feel weird about vaginas but this show is about destigmatizing topics that others are too afraid to address. I can agree that not everything is fleshed out as well as some other shows do like sex education but I give props to the creators for even taking the leap to talk about these topics.
I love this show. I like the crazy humor
I enjoy it,that's all that matters.everything subjective
Big Mouth sucks. I only hate watch it because I like to torture myself and see how bad it can get. The only good thing about the show is the monster concept. That's it. Human Resources is better in my opinion. (Although that show has problems as well)
This video will not convince me to watch big mouth because my brain forces me to watch things in order and the first few episodes I saw I didn’t really like.
anyone else found it weird when in season 5 missy’s lovebug didnt appear even though they were the focus last season?
38:39 did you just say that was good? How is that any good? That’s such a stupid reason to replace a voice actress. Your morals are very questionable Mark 🤦‍♂️
I think the old Larry Sylvester Mark art style is better.
So much decent shows get pulled before the crappy shows dont get canceled because they want to leave low quality crap
Not exactly teenagers
Yea I watch all the seasons and still don't have a real opinion about the show I had laughs from it but the whole time felt like the fbi was going to break down my door.
My partner likes certain aspects of the show and thinks it can be pretty passable at points. But I can’t get over how the show looks. It’s just so visually repulsive to me…
Oh I actually liked how F is for family looked.
Yo is this Chicago (USA) from tekken? 9:44
It’s sexual things with children depicted. No
The biggest thing people don't realize with companies like Netflix is that, at the end of the day, profit is the biggest point to them. You can make a groundbreaking show, but if it isn't popular enough or doesn't pull in enough profit, it isn't deemed a success. Everyone I know (I'm 17) has seen at least one episode of Big Mouth but I doubt even half of the people I know even saw any promotion material for Inside Job. It's kinda sad.
The boss baby back in business is good
Woah new design caught me off guard
The people seeing the hormone monsters is like who can understand stewie. Its random.
"the idea is genius" I mean, it was when Starkid made Me and My Dick in 2009
Go back to the old art style please
I like the new animation for you it looks so nice
Before i start the video, yes
I'm confused how this show is doing this well...
Would love to see you do a review of bojack horseman. It’d be breath of fresh air to see you review something that isn’t a hot pile of garbage and actually enjoy yourself throughout the duration of one of these haha
In my opinion, it is really bad, like insanely bad, but for some reason I still watched it.
HE'S DEFFERINT!!
i laughed more a the random low quality cat you kept putting up than i did any of the jokes in that show.
Yes, yes it is.
>gets sponsored by a company that shows how to cook good food >makes the most grey Anglo-Saxon looking food
It's just so ugly looking 🫤
38:57 those damn Huwhites
i’m so upset inside job got canceled
Thanks for the blur that was the scene I noped out on just didn't feel like seeing it
5:51 That's honestly how they missed the mark to me. I don't remember puberty to be that bad, mostly because I had already a lot of worries due to Asperger, so some hair, weird voice and hormones weren't a big deal. Same for my brother who had to worry more about a new school where they forced him to learn a new language. Seriously, the biggest tip you can give to a pubert is TO NOT WORRY ABOUT CHANGES, just focus and ask your parents.
35:04 idiots don't realise that if you're a fan of something you should be _more_ critical of it.
as much as I loved f is for family, i thought the last season was disappointing
I never liked this show but after hearing the premise I am very uncomfortable..
29:34 if a person has a birth defect or genetic defect it can result in the improper production of hormones.
Whether or not big mouth is good or not we can all agree mark's new style is straight 🔥 🔥
Big Mouth is such a strange case where I've watched every episode and probably laughed like once per season, but Im not watching it for the comedy which is I guess how a number of people watch it too. I genuinely think the premise and how they convey hormones and emotions both metaphorically and literally with a Monsters Inc type spin-off is very creative and engaging to watch. But Jesus Christ, drop the shitty humor for godsake or at least drastically reduce it, I can not emphasize enough how unfunny this show is. It's honestly a shame how much they focus on, "this show is so gross" when it's something to endure and look past than an actually selling point. It's like how everyone who likes Total Drama Island isn't clamoring for the fart jokes you know.
The discussion of the coming-of-age story just reminded me of a game, Terranigma. It's not a literal coming-of-age story since Ark, the protagonist, is at least 16-17. It's about Ark maturing to accept responsibility, even if something big (like restoring the entire planet) shouldn't be a single person's responsibility.  Fantastic game, emulate it at 60 Hz since the game was only released in English in Europe.
The ideas in this show are really great, it could’ve been one of my favourite cartoons. I really hate how they ruined everything with bad comedy, art style, and overall execution of the concepts
For as loud as the Big Mouth Hatedom can be I'm very suprised that I didn't know that it was up to 7 seasons UNTIL that recent news release following those growing amounts of cancellations. Watching this video and reading the comments of the posts on Mark's community page for Big Mouth I still feel like... I still don't fully understand how this show has lasted this long but like Mark said cast a wide enough net and you'll meet a quota of some kind. I kinda wish the Big Mouth fandom was louder cuz like... I definitely wanna gain some more perspective on why people think its some modicum of good. Espcially hearing the cool potential Big Mouth has with some of the stories is sweet but it sucks how much they fumble the ball generally. Also doesn't help how a lotta people definitely DON'T wanna feel like they're watching CP casually like this especially given how the show made fun of that borderline. Personally that type of thought was what stopped me from thinking of wanting to watch it before and after graduating high school.
I like how no one is talking about of mark is made a new pfp.
What's interesting was that Big Mouth came out around the time I was facing similar issues as the characters relating to sexuality and identity. I'm practically held hostage by it because regardless of it's horrid style and very in your face humor, it is also one of the few shows that actually tries to have some sexual education and representation that aren't just surface level. I think the issue relates back to the fact that at the end of the day it truly is a show where you can't pin exactly who the show is for.
Big mouth is one of the shows of all time.
Bro you can't spend an hour talking about this show and then censor every use of the word 'sex' or 'sexual,' it's REALLY distracting.
49:23 is that a fUCKING JOJO REFERENCE?!
It's the Teen Titans Go affect. I used to hate that show when I was younger. Now I love and appreicate it.
You missed the mark so bad you didn't realize Andrew is the main character. Your opinions are valid, but this review is just awful. It's supposed to subvert and push boundaries, and I think it did a great job. I do believe this is not for everyone, and there are times it goes too far for even me, but after the first rewatch I really enjoyed it.
Majorly off topic but at 28:42 that Rage Racer ost hit me right in the nostalgia 🥲
yes.
bigmouth ranking when
Everyone that has reviewed this show hateeeees it but everyone likes Matthew!
Man I remember giving this show a chance at season 1, then the shit started and then it got, uncomfortable even though some parts are eh ok?but, so, yeah I hate it 100% shouldn’t get another reasons
the thing is is that it's not even bad, its convoluted and unfiltered.
So if this show is actually good, then that just brings up the question of why do the other good adult animated shows get shit treatment? If Netflix understands that this show gets good ratings, why do they just disregard that for the other shows?
23:22 you PAID THEM to see big mouth?
The old LS Mark cartoon character was cuter, this one looks weird.
I think there are some jokes in the show that are genuinely funny but a majority of the show Is a cross up of dumb fun and disgust, it does suck that this show keeps getting seassons while everything else is getting canceled. All in all this show is like  6.5 or 7/10
This whole thing appears to be written by an average normie completely unaware of the whole culture war thing going on. I commend you for giving it the benefit of the doubt, but holy shit the fact you were even 'doubting' anything is hilariously concerning. I was convinced this show was trash without watching a single episode, thinking it was just going to be another woke leftists dumpsterfire, and all this deep dive did was prove me right. It's garbage written by and for leftists.  the "white woman" who got fired isn't even white!
2:30 The best way to not be a hypocrite is to recognise that the majority of all media is shit.
Hey dude I was enjoying this video but I just got to know who busted out the bass at 24:58, my man's popping off, Mark always has great music in his videos.
Animation fans hurt my brain. They shit on stuff but if you have reasonable critisism on shows they like they get pissed.  I watch animated things and watch videos about them but I avoid the community. Tbh I hate modern Disney animated shows like Amphibia and The Owl House and I know I'd get beaten up just for saying that so I just avoid the community.
I didn’t hate Big Mouth, but I also didn’t like it either. It was honestly just raunchy humor but the genuinely funny stuff that would peek in would be what kept me watching it. But I skipped the most recent season, I was happy with the end of season 5 I don’t care what’s in season 6 lmao
This animation genuinely made me lost my appetite
Ls mark turned from fairly odd parents OC to a curious George OC
Throughout my entire puberty life, I thought Big Mouth was just an adult's perversion of what puberty is actually like. I related to NONE of it.
It’s not that bad for a casual watch. It has its moments🤷🏾‍♀️ I don’t mind it but I’ve also watched since day one
I can understand why Big Mouth comes off as awkward when it has to tackle puberty in depth, I can't say the same for Family Guy knock offs that try to be gross and use a derivative style.
ive never seen it so idk if this gets answered, but as a trans guy, do people learn theyre trans by being visited by the opposite gender hornone monster? thatd be interesting.
Yes
Man this show is hard to look at tbh, no i couldnt do any better
I watched this show with my friends, and while they were all laughing their asses off, my brain was in severe pain trying to figure out the rules before the whole pillow pregnancy thing then I realized this whole show is the epitome jumping the shark
Soft cp: 7 seasons An actually good animated show: 1 season (probably cancelled before release)
Yep. Just more proof Netflix is run by MAPs. More reason to stay as far away as possible.
Yes. I will admit though, I do like Connie the hormone monstress design
Was Shadman an animator on big mouth
this is weird bro,, smh,,
Dude, Mark.. this show freaking sucks. Netflix bucks is keeping this alive lets be honest.
7:40 thats  one of the only characters i like  (:
love love love the new sprites and background!!!!
cough cough also the creators family is like billionaires, it aint getting taken off air lmao
I wonder if Big Mouth will overstay it's welcome any time soon.  Like, looking at this video i was able to reconsider a lot of my previous thoughts, but let's be honest:   Long running shows tends to drop in quality.  I wonder how much Big Mouth can keep up an good score with their average enjoyer when they already reached six seasons with no sign of stoping...
It's getting tiring seeing "They canceled (show) over big mouth (or other animated show that twitter hates)
Thank you Mark for giving g ke a new opinion I can steal from the internet
The part that’s bad is that this show should’ve ended around s2 , both it and the others got cucked by Netflix… big mouth Wanted to be a small comedy with hormone monsters with a little plot conceptually, “shorter family guy”   The canceled ones don’t benefit from it, the ones that aren’t also don’t
I really hope you make a video about F is for Family some time. I really, really love that show but it doesn’t get the hype it deserves because it’s also so fucking ugly.
3:34 nah il stick with my pepsi addiction (:
24:07 im almost scared to know what this is
Only the people morri is asigned to can see him
38:28 bro turned into a mouse
Why is it bad? It sexualizes kids, that’s why. Idk about you but that is inherently off putting to most people.
I hate the pillow stuff, but I love the show
I love your new rantsona's art
Hooked up with a random actor she likes. Clearly you never saw the show he was in
a little good a lot bad  end of argument
When would you rank Fairly Oddparents
Season 4 was never going to be the end of Big Mouth… Netflix had already renewed the show for seasons 4, 5 and 6 before Season 3 had even aired. Similarly, Brutus Pink (Big Mouth’s production company) and Netflix just renewed their partnership through 2026, which means Krull & Co. aren’t going anywhere anytime soon and there will be more Big Mouth, more Human Resources and more original adult animation projects to come.
I didn't know people didn't like Big Mouth, I really like it.
Love the new art
Can we just talk about how nice the new sprites look 👀  Nicer than the bigmouth art for sure Lmao-
To me, Big Mouth is the adult equivalent of TTG, there’s just no point in complaining about a show that’s clearly successful anymore.  People forget this but online animation communities you see on social media are an EXTREMELY tiny yet loud minority in the human population, it doesn’t matter how much you protest about an animated show you like getting canned or blaming a show you disliked because at the end of the day, Big Mouth is extremely popular with the real life general public audience, some of my family members have watched it before.  I personally have no interest in the show itself to watch it but I’m just giving off my two cents every time I see cartoon nerds having a meltdown on Twitter every time Netflix cancels a show that was never popular outside the internet bubble to begin with.
47:45 Bruh, Big Mouth did To Boldly Flee. Nick Kroll pulled a Nostalgia Critic.
Big Marth?
I personally despise this show’s existence not because of the content the show it’s self is just whatever it was made but it made about 3 people in my friend group routinely making cringes Jokes or references about the show or just begging me to watch it constantly which made about a month of 2 of my life insufferable
I thought big mouth is a kid show
Yes  0:50 I like the new still
The show is bellow average most of the time but that theme is so good
Big Mouth is the ugliest show I have ever seen
I honestly feel like Big Mouth could have been a really good show if it weren't for the gratuitous nature of it. Yeah I get that the art style and humor is supposed to match the ugliness of puberty but it really derails its own messages most of the time. I could have gotten the message that "m*********n is a thing you shouldn't be ashamed of" without watching borderline cp. If the show actually took itself seriously at times (because comedies can be serious, which this show seems to forget) we could have ended up with better character development and story lines. I also have an issue that the message is pointed towards teens yet is rated MA; it honestly has no idea who it's target audience is so that's why I believe the humor is so bad and dry most of the time. To wrap this up, Big Mouth was doomed from the start. With the bad art style, terrible writing, bad comedy, and failed messages, there was no hope in it ever being good.
Honestly Big Mouth is the Riverdale of animated adult comedy… i think that’s all I need to say really
Do chowder now lol
Agh I love the new LS Mark character stills so much, the new style looks so good!!
Big mouth having 99% on rotten tomatoes means nothing they and many other sites like IMDb and metacritic are rarely representative of what actual audiences think. Rotten tomatoes gave cuties near perfect scores and that’s still hated for all the right reasons. Big mouths no different.
Rank every episode of American Dad please
Ay does anyone have the music for 34:00? I cant find it in the description anywhere
My favorite topic of this episode was the 1 minute part he mentioned Rick and Morty
Wow! I can see your quality has improved significantly! Keep it up mark!
so sad about inside job :(
HOLYSHIT LSMARK HAS SNOKED WEED?!?!!
Dude I live this new art style for you looks a lot like Butch Hartman’s style which I think Is what you were going for and it looks really cool 👍🏻
Big Mouth is such a strange contradiction for me. There’s a lot of aspects that I think are incredibly well done and a lot of aspects that make me roll my eyes and groan anytime they’re brought up. Andrew’s 24/7 hormones is the main one.
I think it has really good lgbtq representation and it helps normalize some of the stuff kids go through in puberty.
my entire family watches big mouth to be honest, and I myself find it funny (a mediocre show to me though-).  Don’t think it deserves all the hate, but I understand it.
A change in style of a YouTuber that I actually like
I actually enjoyed the spin off Human Resources but then again maybe my standards have dropped.
Nice review, but I gotta say, it really still ticks me off when Mark has to buzz any swear words or any of that. Not your fault obviously, but lets hope youtube gets better. Love your vids Mark.
I've never seen a single episode of this show but just from what I've seen here it seems like better writers could have done some interesting things with the premise. Like using Nick getting a female demon to explore their gender identity and stuff like that. Maybe getting an old demon could have related to the kid discovering they're aro or ace (or both). That's just stuff off the top of my head though.
Big Mouth it's like watching a massive multiple car accident. It's not good at all, you know it's gonna end terribly, but yet, you can't split your eyes from it just for the sheer morbidity.
Idk why but everytime a non-spanish speakers uses Ibai exam strategy meme it catches me off guard, it's so funny it goes trough languages, and I love it
honestly i checked out when the pillow stuff started
MARKS BACK AAAAAAAAAAA MARKS BACK SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP MARKS BACk
My guess is that the show started to decrease in quality as time went on or people don’t hate they just wish it wasn’t the only show that kept going for so long
Not everyone can see the monsters only people who are atypical tend to be able to. Every person does have their own hormone monster but hormone monsters can have multiple clients like Connie had Jessie and Nick at one point. Missy has Mona as her hormone monster and we have seen other kids with different hormone monsters. The monsters more so are like inner thoughts or things in,y the person can hear to help push the person towards whatever it best for what that monster does.
Yes
I think of Big Mouth a lot like Big Bang Theory. I haven’t watched Human Resources but I’ve heard it’s pretty good, similarly to how people don’t really praise the Big Bang theory, but really enjoy Young Sheldon. I think that they started Big Mouth as this random idea in which they just threw a bunch of shit together to see what worked, and with Human Resources they’re taking what they’ve learnt and making an actual good show
i dated a guy for way longer than i should have who was a huge fan of bigmouth and tried to get me to watch it with him but i hated the art style so much i refused to watch it lol. we dated before bigmouth came out but him being a fan of the show and isnt what ended things or anything like that, just in retrospect its funny to me Anyway i think your review is really good and well thought out, i almost feel like ive watched the show without actually needing to watch it! and can come to my own conclusion that i still am not interested in watching! :D
Noticed right away that you're censoring yourself. Why does YouTube hate the fun stuff?
Big Mouth is one of those shows on Netflix that nothing but children and people that'll watch anything no matter the quality
Nah genuinely I hate big mouth
It's like spongebob, it isn't all bad but most of it is unbearable so the good gets lost in the sauce
Am I the only fan of the show since season 1
I actually like most of what Nick Kroll has done. But… Big Mouth just… is badddddd….
I just assumed the reason Big Mouth keeps getting renewed is because it’s created by the son of a billionaire! No money out of Netflix’s pockets that way
Mark i just wanted to say I really like the new sprites they are wonderful
New theory: hormone monsters are stands from jojo.
Bro what if Nick is trans and just doesn't realize it yet
47:56 giving me serious Nostalgia Critic/To Boldly Flee vibes
7:20 Why should it make any more sense than “Nick Kroll wanted a Roger the Alien in his show.”
I actually enjoy big mouth
I love it its my comfort show funny enough I rewatched the seasons a lot and even done art of it
I can’t stand this show. Literally I cannot sit through it, it’s just not my cup of tea
Its way too much overly hated with the same points that don't even apply really to the show anymore. People hate on it because it's popular to hate on it.
Can we talk about how subpar that meal looked tho. The broccoli looked fine but I can't even figure out what kind of meat that's supposed to be 😭
Never seen the show, but i'll go ahead and say because here in America, the people in charge seem hellbent on sexualizing kids younger and younger. I'm 33 and can remember new episodes of the simpsons early as 1993...i couldn't imagine shit like this available to kids my age growing up. Everything's got an agenda. Seems like a pretty clear one to me.
Matthew's my absolute favorite in this show as well. And being voiced by Andrew Rannells does a lotta good to my 4Kids anime loving heart which gives him brownie points from me
I actually like it alot it makes me feel seen and ik the humor is gross and not for everyone but I like it
That’s the thing that pisses me off about the swearing stuff people are grown swearing is a natural thing hell in other countries the kids do it at young ages and some of them don’t I’m like it’s a part of life who the hell cares I’m so tired of society trying to push awa,The stuff that’s not actually that bad but you know whatever this is America could be worse there are more dry countries out there 21:43
Yes.
The creator/showrunner of a cartoon not writing a lot of episodes seems to be not that uncommon.  The biggest example I can think of is SpongeBob. Everyone gives all the credit for how great the show was to Stephen Hillenburg (partially out of sentimentality and remembrance, I'm sure), and while yes, he was definitely an important asset to the show and it gradually got way worse after he stepped down... he only wrote about three episodes of the show, and they were all VERY early on.
I think Big Mouth is actually pretty decent. It's got a lot of relatable content to it, and it sometimes is actually educational for its target audience (like older-ish teens from people I know who have seen it). Like UTI's, bullying, shame, awkward sex and relationships, divorce, the pressure of academic achievement and the gravitation toward drugs to solve your problems, child negligence, embracing your heritage and culture. There's a lot going on with it. I think it's obnoxious and far too on the nose, but it's real world problems covered by the facade of dark humor.
Love the new sprite work!
i like human resources way more tbh
Considering how your 1hr+ long South Park and Smosh videos were demonetized, I'm determined this one doesn't suffer the same fate
Yoooo Bro the new avatars are so good
🤓
To answer the question? Yes it is.  The whole show relies on shock value. I tried watching from the beginning and made it about 1 season before giving up. And I think what happens is that the humor gets old at the end of the season, then the gap between seasons is just enough for the shock to wear out.  And I definitely don't mind the animation style; I enjoyed Border Town.
1-21-23 Note: I am going to note in this comment as I watch the video. I'll post the comment when I either need to sleep or want to take a break. Around 2:05 I don't think the arguments for cancelling Big Mouth are really for cancelling Big Mouth. It's for not cancelling these other shows. Like Big Mouth is still alive while other shows get cancelled, even though Big Mouth doesn't look as good. Comparing cartoons like "Inside Job" to Big Mouth is more like what they're talking about. Like, of all the things, Inside Job seems more valuable that Big Mouth, but Inside Job gets cancelled after much praise was shown for it rather than Big Mouth which keeps getting panned on the Internet. 8:06 Man, the premise sounds weird and doesn't make a molecule of sense. 24:48 What the frick is this show? I can see why people don't like it and want it cancelled. 27:30 Hamfisted messaging? Waaaa-oow. 31:03 So far, I think I may be able to summarize what the series will become Season 1: Floundering with weird animation and acting like a Family Guy clone. Season 2: S**ual Stuff, Why was this animated?, and hamfisting the themes. Tried to improve, but was only barely better. 33:18 Season 3: More of Season 1, the Last 4 Episodes were more like the Good Parts of Season 2, but a bit more believable. 35:09 So there is good in the series, it's just overshadowed by a lot of bad. There are likable moments. 39:20 So it has a lot of problems, but has good parts. That's my conclusion from someone who doesn't want to watch it. I'll Comment now to make this comment less long.
it is literal cp
Mark, your latest video is not about Ranking EVERY South Park Episode Ever! anymore
Human Resources is like Big Mouth but with adult issues. It's a spin off and I actually like it more than BM
taking no chances with the garbage new youtube rules i see, it's ridiculous the rules pushed you to the point of censoring words like "sexual" in the context of sexual maturity. actually insane. good luck with this bullshit mark, love the channel
I never knew there was so many different ways to pronounce mouth
From what I hear with certain ideas and concepts it could be interesting. Like seeing someone else's pov first experiencing anxiety or depression how it manifests for them with a creature following them. And how things like that can in turn affect their lives making it harder. I feel this show needs a funnel. It feels like Ren and Stimpy when they got their adult cartoon, just allowed to be vulgar for the sake of it because haha vagina. Whereas I feel if they had some tighter confines a bit or someone to funnel their ideas and jokes it could make it a lot better. Forcing writers to be a bit more subtle or creative with ideas and jokes.
Why is the restaurant from Seinfeld the same restaurant in this show the fuck?
I hate when people compare Big Mouth to a cancelled show to voice their frustrations. Fact of the matter is a lot of people watch Big Mouth. Of course people were watching the other show too, but it just didn't meet Netlfix's ridiculous standards.
Im sorry but no way you referred to Nathan Fillion as some random actor. Great Vid regardless 👍.
Maybe why it wasn't cancelled is because the creator parents are millionaires
fucking love the new character thingy
The art style of the show ALMOST reminds me of as told by ginger tbh, and i kind of feel like its appropriate considering it is about puberty and growing up. I think it couldve looked pretty decent if they leaned into a rougher animation style.
Wait this was just a ranking every episode in disguise!
mark's new character design makes me nauseous
24:47 Sometimes your accent really doesn't help
I miss ur old art
Really appreciate you watching this at the cost of your sanity Mark, cuz now I don't have to. I'll remember you though.   Kind of sad how this show squanders such an interesting premise just to focus on being as unfunny as possible. Just goes to show that just because you have gold doesn't mean you necessarily know what to do with it.
I tried watching the first season of Big Mouth and felt physical pain Kinda have to admire people who can sit through this entire show
In my opinion gender reassignment surgery should become illegal @LS Mark!
The show just became a mess when it struggled to maintain it’s modern sexuality/identity politics in a fair and relatable balance. It started delving into more shock value than interesting and intensely up-close takes on growing up and learning to be comfortable in your own skin. The show always seemed to have the potential to just deteriorate into what it is now, but it was sorta fun while it lasted for those that were amused. It oddly had this charm of a Disney XD show that came on at 2am in an alternate universe.
Yes.
The Valentine’s Day episode did come out before season 3
Oh hey wait ls Mark update
The one big thing I can take away from this video is that it's great to see that the cartoon community is growing and that now, it's slowly going on its way to becoming comparable to the anime community. Hope to see the amazing strides that we, as a fanbase make in a few years.
You will not convince me that big mouth is anything more than garbage.
yes it is
I feel like too many people focus on the "this show got picked over dead end / inside job / (insert popular animation that was inexplicably cancelled)" aspect of big mouth instead of the "this show costs them twenty cents to make per episode" lol
I don't know about the other drugs but weed doesn't make you see rainbows it makes you sleepy and allows you to laugh more and i'm sick to death about how weed is protrayed in TV shows
LS Doing A Full Series Review with Less than 100 Episodes??? WHAAAATTT???
Your new character design looks amazing. Props to whoever drew it cause it looks great 👍👍👍
Yes.
Hey Mark can you review Wednesday please.
I think it's moved over to being "but they renewed Velma" now
This whole show is the definition of "meh." It's not a classic piece of animation history, but it's also not the literal spawn of Satan a lot of people on Twitter make it out to be. Netflix has greenlit far worse media (like that one movie where a man gets pregnant seriously wtf was Netflix thinking?). Still dropped it after season 2 tho. Never really felt like they were tackling the subject of puberty that well and relied too much on shocking stuff they knew people would complain about on Twitter.
I can't get over the way you pronounce "mouth", I love it lmfao
Where are you from? It's like you almost have an American accent but not quite, so every other word sounds kind of wrong.
Mark do have a sweet diary of a wimpy kid book collection tho
LS Mark boutta hate me but the new profile ain’t it. Looks way too inspired from a certain someone
Cant wait for the entirety of big mouth to be reviewed
Great video Mark, but the new design is really hard on the eyes
Been a fan of this show since it debuted in 2017. I get that it’s very lowbrow and gross out humor, but everyone who’s a fan of this show knows what there in for. But what I can say, I like the humor and the characters. Not much else I expect from a show like this. But I do I stand why others really don’t care for it
I genuinely don't know almost anything about this show. I don't have any intention of watching it either, because no matter how good this show is (or isn't because again, I have no idea), that art style is a deal breaker for me.
Love the new avatar Mark! Looks sleek and clean!
I’m not really on one side or the other when it comes to replacing voice actors with new ones that match the race of the characters they play, but since Missy is biracial (half black and half white), I don’t really see the need to change her voice actor.
This video and the podcast from yesterday imply that mark went from a week of watching breaking bad, to a week of watching big mouth
Ok the love bugs turned into “ hate WORMS “ but bro they coulda just called them HATE SNAKES it made me SO MADE they were a “Hate WORM”
Yes
I only watch season 1- half 3 and even that just feel very uncomfortable when the show came out. I just i understand dark humor I love it to the core.. but the thing is South Park one those few shows that yes it’s can take it too far but doesn’t over bare.
The reason why it probably blew up is probably kids watching something that they clearly are bot allowed to see. Or teenagers. When I was at high school several years back. I would ask meny of my classmates what they think of the show. And they said they love it. I absolutely hate it and I haven't even watched a single episode exept a sprinkle of clips on line. Its always the young watching somthin vary inappropriate. And not targeted to there age demographic. Giving shit shows good ratings
yes
Are the pictures of marks character redone or something? They seem different in some way but it's definitely not a different art style
I really like the new art and all but DAMN I’m really gonna miss the old art tbh
The people worked hard on it argument is unbelievably stupid like if u worked hard to hurt people you are not in the right if u worked hard in cp your disgusting and so is your creation idk it jus t kinda pisses me off how people use that as justification in disgusting or plain bad creations
Mark: gets a artist to draw new frames for his character also Mark: 2:30
I absolutely hate the the art style. It makes me want to boil my eyes every time I see it.
Hey LS Mark, could you do a review of the show of DuncanVille?
Avid Big mouth enjoyer opinion!  I loved big mouth! It was amazing during the first few series and they still bring out gems!  BUT! It should have been canceled after season 3! Season 4 when they go to the camp and that one scene in the forest made me feel so unwell! I haven't gone back to watch it so I don't know if it was even that bad! Either canceled after season 3 or just skip season 4.  I still watch the show, I watched Human Resources and I will continue to watch the show! I don't even know why because when you posted this video and I heard there was a sixth season, I had to check my Netflix to discover that I had watched the whole series and had failed to remember it!  My favorite episode of all time is "Disclosure the movie: the musical"  it is such a good episode but I HATE the episode straight after where they all have superhero powers! It is so bad.  I don't agree with comments about voice actors because I personally think the fact that Nick has a deeper voice than Andrew makes it fun and brings a weird aspect to the show. Coach Steve, I love his character, I think he is so random and comes in random places but I do also understand why that would be weird for someone who doesn't enjoy that sort of character!
Yes it absolutely is, it’s god awful
personally, i thought the first few episodes were horrible. It felt more forced and PURELY to talk about s£x and puberty, kind of like a health class video with frequent profanity. But as it went on, it slowly progresses more focusing on plot.
I remember watching this, I remember enjoying it, but I couldn't tell you a single thing about it.
havent even watched the video, but yes it is
I love BIg Mouth
ngl big mouth is my guilty pleasure
Before I watch this video I will say, I jumped on the hate band wagon back when it first came to Netflix. I couldn't watch it since I had no internet, but a little bit after season 3 came out, a group of people would eat in the computer room during lunch to watch Netflix, I didn't have anyone to talk to during lunch since my friend moved (I never got his number so Idk what happened to him, hope one day I can meet him again, if not, hope when i go to heaven he's there so i can say, wassup mate) anyways, I decided to go in there to join in and they were watching big mouth season 2, at first, said that it was trash, but after awhile, started to like it so Ill defend the show and say that it does have some funny moments.  I haven't kept up with it though tbh, after season 3, haven't watched the show again so couldn't tell ya what happens, anyways imma watch the vid now, sorry for the long comment lol.
Love the video, this show had gross moments but it’s nice that it has moments where there’s actual emotion and storytelling
Never watched Big Mouth but god I am sick of this american attitude of having cartoon characters and their voice actors being the same race. Is it a meta way to be culturally sensitive/appropriate? It’s not a bad thing but I don’t think it’s necessary or a requirement. It gets even worse when the voice actor has to also have the same sexuality as the cartoon character they play, like why? Can’t we just have talented people play their role and ignore the race of a fictional character? Where are those good old fashioned values on which we used to rely.
Big Mouth desperately needs a time skip
Why did u change your YouTube avatar
Actualmente i have blood fobia and especiales menofobia and this show just pues me paranoic cause you know pill cant be all the solución. I tried Belice me, and the humor usted not really good makes me felicito uncumfortable somethimes
I’ve never thought this show was funny and always disliked the designs. I watched the first season because I was intrigued by the concept of a graphic animated show covering coming of age stuff. But I don’t think I found any of the jokes funny or any of the characters particularly likeable or relatable apart from some fairly generic troupes of kids entering puberty.
I think it’s funny for the most part, but there are certain scenes I completely skip bc they’re REALLY gross and uncomfortable. I stopped watching it after a certain scene bc it was too much
I wholeheartedly agree with the point about shows involving teens dealing with adult situations. If you've ever made it all the way through high school, you've probably had some friends who made immature jokes about their bodies or talk about s**.... and there's a reason for that.  The problem isn't that shows involving teens go into this territory, the problem is that there's a way to go about it without making it uncomfortable. In more explicit or extreme cases, it's gotta be more implied rather than outright shown, and too many shows with premises like this show more than they should.
Hormone monstress is hot.
To me it's like velma, it doesn't matter if the rest of it is objectively the best written piece of fiction in all of history, I'm not going to watch it  if I can't get through the first episode, watching a show that makes big big theory look like comedic gold that doesn't understand how things like meatcanyon having a grotesque artstyle actually make it funny stay alive while actually good things get canceled is so annoying
His name is Maury lol.
Well thankfully Big Mouth isn't the only adult rated cartoon on Netflix there are a few others for the time being. If you don't like the show then I advise do not hate watch it, just ignore it and pretend it doesn't exist.
wow that new "art" (IDK what to call it) is pretty good
Big mouth is the impostor among the “seth McFarlane” style shows.
Like the new look man. It’s cool to see your art style continuing to grow as your channel does
It's funny
big mouth feels like a comforting hug especially when your going through puberty like me. The trans character especially felt so comforting to me and helped me realize i was trans.
Ah yes, a review of the show that’s actually, you know, a review.
damn, marks new sprite looks fresh!
They rlly should give this show a chance, the way they represented pre teens, sexualities, identities, empowerment is just amazing. Besides being a “gross” show, its still a good show! I actually learned a lot from this than in health class, gross content doesnt mean the entire content is BAD
I hate your new avatar's teeth it looks cartoony and ridiculous @LS Mark!!!
47:48 Not exactly a good sign when the people behind the show decided to rip off the ending of To Boldly Flee.
If you're brave enough, then you should review the worst animated movie ever, Foodfight! and go over the story behind the development of the movie. Trust me, this movie is flat out HORRENDOUS.
Yes
Bro this entire time I thought Andrew was the main character
Nice avatar looks really good
It is moderately funny, I give it a 5/10, if my brother is watching it I don't feel like leaving the living room. 👍
Respectfully that meal looks ASS. Shit look like a hungry jack meal
They cancelled Santa Clarita Diet on a cliff hanger and then greenlit this shit stain for another season.
6:58p.m. 1/21/2023
14:17 where did the word “that” go?
[🖤]I hate the new design of mark, so i'm glad our company finished the spongebob video and made a show out of it called "big man"
The show is utterly unfunny. Didn’t laugh once.
Ooooooooo nice rebrand mark
Big mouth had INCREDIBLE potential. The concept of the physical personification of hormones is really fucking cool in my opinion, and the first season is actually kinda ok. But then they got really fucking weird and shitty about it. Big Mouth is the best example I can think of of Great Premise, Rotten Execution.
Maybe the Creators just had voices in there heads
I hate your new avatar it looks terrible and different @LS Mark!!!
Is Big Mouth crap?  Yes....yes it is.  Is its first to second season sometimes relatable and has its moments?  Also yes, very much so, even quite funny sometimes.  But the one thing i CAN say with all the funny juice in my Heart is: it is new, creative and obiously had a lot of passion behind.....some of it at least.  And most importand of all:  ⁱᵗ ⁿᵉᵛᵉʳ ᵈᵉᶠⁱˡᵉᵈ ᵃⁿʸ ᵒʳⁱᵍⁱⁿᵃˡ ˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ ᵐᵃᵗᵉʳⁱᵃˡ  Because shows like velma that did that: (っ◔◡◔)っ ♥𝕒𝕣𝕖 𝕒 𝕡𝕚𝕝𝕖 𝕠𝕗 𝕘𝕒𝕣𝕓𝕒𝕘𝕖♥
Cons: depicts children, sometimes cringe  Pros: sexual education that parents and school systems fail at, fun take on human condition especially in human resources tackling adults to
I hate the new profile picture it looks disgusting @LS Mark!!!
So, why the hell does it have 99% on RT?
dog, the only series i've ever watched on netflix is Breaking Bad, the f is a big mouth?
Has Mark ever talked about Dragon Ball? I found the music choice at the end interesting
Nice to see LS Mark is taking a look at bootleg Kaguya
idk if it's just me but the new OC redesign feels so stiff and lifeless
It may not be that bad, but it's not that good to be as long running as it is.
yes
Honestly Matthew should've been the protagonist of big mouth, because it truly captures how depraved the straight kids seem when gay kids are that same age
Weird, I liked the later seasons of Big Mouth more than the firsts.
I predict that in a few style changes Marks character is gonna look like one of the generic cartoons everyone currently hates
yes yes it is
The channel rebrand is absolutely stellar!
Quit hating
HEY... How was Inside Job? The premise sounds interesting but I only heard about it recently.
I mean, them not doing anything outside of school was the most realistic thing about the show to me. I remember having "best friends I literally only ever saw in school
Human Resources is WAY better. It actually had heart.
Holly shit there are people more lonely then me WOW
Positive comment
You’re living in America now?
I LOVED Human Resources more than Big Mouth. BM always rubbed me the wrong way, especially with the more perverted scenes involving CHILDREN. 🫠🫠🫠  Human Resources touched on a lot of adult emotions (including “love” and sex) without having to see it through the eyes of a child. Even the episode about PPD was well written. 😊
Studio Change! : >
The first season had some pretty funny moments but it went downhill after that
Yes
Laser pointers certainly cures my depression..... For a while...
I really like it(except for season one, which I fucking hate). I think you have to be a teenager to actually enjoy it because I think it’s pretty relatable.
I wouldn't call Big Mouth a terrible show (I wouldn't call it a great show either), it has a concept that some would be impressed by, while its style of humor/heavy-handedness with its messaging that'll leave other people not giving it the time of day.  The majority of its hatred comes from the fact that Netflix considers it one of its flagship series while canceling many other shows that their subscribers liked.
This year is probably going down as the murder of animation
god that thumbnail is so cursed
44:39 That Mumkey reference threw me off so hard, dear lord.
Video reported for copyright infringement and bullying.
Holy shit HD LSMark
Make video about Velma
Love the new sprites, Mark
Cool new art style mark! Kinda like the old one a little more though
To be honest I think the entire show is absolutely terrible, except for the one joke about the hormone monster sounding like will Arnett. at least I can acknowledge that it’s nothing compare to Bojack Horseman. Actually, I kind of have to take that back it’s a good show for the people around 12 to 16 years old so that they can learn a bit more in a very crass way that is easy for the under developed brains to comprehend in comparison.
The joke is that Netflix is an overlord that they have to push it.
Ranking EVERY Big Mouth Episode Ever
Caleb is supposed to be weird, so the joke is he sees the monster when others don’t.
Big mouth is fine its not bad but its not like some amazing god send when the show comes out then yeah i will binge it its some times funny but the spin off Human Resources sucks
I absolutely love Nick Kroll's sketch comedy show Kroll Show, so I wanted to like this, but I just couldn't get into it. It never appealed to me, even though I was actually excited to see it because it was Nick Kroll. I watched a few episodes of season 1 when it started, but I immediately realized it wasn't for me.
Yep no good. Of course I stand by my claims and refuse to be hypocritical that all these shows that are being cancelled left and right haven't interested me lately and don't really make me want to watch them. The only thing that's interested me has been anime since to me adult comedy hasn't been truly good ever since the mid to late 2010's. It's all become too formulate to me. The only current adult animated show that  has interested me has been Smiling Friends. And that's not because I've been fans of SleepyCabin and Oneyplays, I genuinely think that Smiling Friends is really great and just shows that you show doesn't have to just be filled with unfunny sexual jokes and unnecessary amounts of swearing to make a joke funny. I know the current state of that show is fairly tame and that Zach and Michael were forced to fall back on a lot of the raunchiness of the show but it still shows how you can do so much with so little.
I can respect your view of this show, I personally have always loved it for some reason. It's sadly going downhill for sure as it goes on, but very slowly. I recently watched it show 3 times in its entirety in a row and didn't get sick of it lmao
To watch and enjoy Big Mouth you have to turn your brain off, take it at face value and just enjoy its weirdness. Don't overthink it or overanalyse it, it's not a very deep show. You either get it or you don't.
Nah I think the characters have big mouths because media and society is about being as loud as possible
the characters dont look like theyre part of the world, like they're just on a flat board
LS Mark drawn in big mouth style isn't real he can't hurt you  This videos thumbnail:
I still refuse to watch this
I'm halfway through your analysis. I remember the boys creating the hottest girls in our grade and realizing my friends weren't really friends but people who settled for the benefits
31:35 literally an episode of South Park.
I’m watching the ad on the vid rn and all I wanted to say is as follows. Yes. It is *that* bad.
south park handles weird gross crap better. ppl that like it are mentally ill.  and i find it creepy that the jew is the one that wants to f their cousin. absolutely insulting.
Big Mouth is a horrible cartoon with a horrible premise and a horrible character designs. There is nothing salvageable in this.
I didn’t know that people hated this show so much. I watch it with my brother all the time and we love it.
Could you please review inside job pls
BTW, nice new pfp! :D
I watched the first season and I thought Andrew WAS the main character
Anyone gonna talk about the new LS Mark design, Bcakgriund and PFP?
WoAh new LS Mark avatar just dropped 😳
You watched the show but you didn’t really *watch* it
Oh u got new logo channel
one thing i love about Big Mouth is how much talent is in the voice cast. like...SO many big names read the scripts and were like "yeah i'll do it"
BM (Big mouth) sounds like BS It is so weird and uncomfortable while It’s spin off only shown a D and so ima say it Do the Spin off it’s good
Wow I am very surprise with the dub in the original. There voices are WAY TO DEEP. Since I am from Brazil I first watched this show in portuguese, and they sound like they are like between 12 to 14. In the original English dub they sound like in there late 30 it is so weird to me ksks
At some point I think Mark should talk about Moral Orel
As a person who suffers from depression, lasers are awesome. Have you guys seen styropyro's channel!? They're so cool and dangerous!!!
Marks new png is good, but i'm just too used to the old one
it feels disconnected, like it feels like they're writing the stuff for the voice cast rather than the characters.
Damn, props to mark's editor for doing censorship in a stylish way. That bassy bleep accompanied by full screen pixelization is actually kinda cool. Almost as cool as CUSSING
Its not THAT bad, but the fact Netflix rather make 7 seasons out of this than giving more seasons to actual good shows is just impressive
The whole revelation that the monster isn't just a figment of the kids imagination, and is actually an ancient alien being that spends all of its time manipulating young teens (literal children) into doing perverse acts is really disturbing.
Before this video I just thought it was an ugly looking show that I quickly decided wasn't for me and ignored. The intro led me to believe I might wrong, but the farther I got into this the worse the show seemed. Stopped after finishing the season 3 segment, because there is no way anything in this video will change my opinion of the show.
Big fan of all the cats you used for this video
my high school had a "mental health awareness" day where a lecturer recommended the depression kitty episodes of big mouth to help us understand depression, which. huh. is interesting.
The new art for your character looks awesome
i hate that i like bigmouth
Are you saying "mouth", "moth" or "morth"?
My opion on it I think the characters designs looks ugly like they don,t look like kids.
Ah! Cursed Thumbnail! 💀  Also back in my day Netflix could show alot of things TV wouldn't. That's why there's so many subscriptions. But now Netflix is kinda trash! I want my Inside Job back! 💔
New lsmark is giving me brain damage it’s gonna be a while to get used to this dork :) I like it
i was maybe 16 when the first season came out so i’m not gonna lie, i thought the show was pretty good for what it was, but season 3 is disgusting and that’s where i stopped
everybody has been hating on big mouth so much lately but i like it so much, idk how to feel anymore
Imo this show is not far off from cp, I liked the earlier seasons but it gives me a weird vibe
Short answer: Yes Long answer: *Still yes*
I really Loved This. I love how you don't sugarcoat it. You immediately get to the point, and you find some way to make your explanations and reviews funny and thought provoking. It's Rare when I see a 1 hour Video all the Way through. Have a Blessed Day Mark
the ls actually stand for Loves Sbigmouth
Every episode of big mouth ranked but u also have to rewatch the show again just for the torture factor
After seeing a bit of the first episodes I will never touch that abomination ever again. Same art style as most other "adult cartoons", ugly ass character designs, disguisting jokes... ew. Real fuckin shame to Netflix for keeping this garbage alive while other creators get their genuinely good stuff yeeted into the shredder
I can't say how good or bad Big Mouth is and I don't agree with the internet calling it the worst thing ever but it baffles me that it's one of the few original series Netflix cares about. Even if Big Mouth was a masterpiece, I still wouldn't understand why all of the platform's focus is being put on this one series when there are so many other series that deserve the same amount of attention. It doesn't make any sense
It's not the worst show ever, but I think it kinda shows how skewed Netflix's priorities are in terms of respecting animation. Like, shows such as Inside Job and The Midnight Gospel aren't worth the trouble renewing for another season despite the positive reception they received, yet Big Mouth gets to have 6 seasons and a spin-off. It's even more ironic when you remember that the Netflix twitter account referenced Guillermo del Toro's quote about animation being a medium in the middle of the entire cancellation fiasco.
The Tekken music is perfect
This Like The Third Video Of Yours Where It Just Feels Like Your Reasoning Was “It’s Not Good Because It’s Not How I Wanted It To Resolve” So Imma Just Say This Finally… How About Make Your Own Cartoon?
What's with the Norville Rogers looking LS Mark?
No  it is
It’s insane to me that to this day, tv shows over exaggerate what smoking ganja is like. I started watching that 90s show and by the 2nd episode, Leah smokes and HALLUCINATES Red and Kitty as gorillas. Her stuff must have been laced, because I don’t know anyone that’s ever hallucinated while smoking, lmao. And all this is coming from someone who doesn’t even smoke ganja (anymore.) 😅 I assume tv shows depict smoking like this, to discourage the youth from smoking, but with something like big mouth, a show made for adults in particular, im not sure why they’d depict smoking like this?
the real reason for Big Mouth has not been cancelled yet is because Nick Kroll's dad is a Billionaire
Big mouth is bad but I hate it more because it and stranger things are the only things not being cancelled out of nowhere by Netflix.
Watching this I realized, the characters are not really that ugly as I remembered. Problem? Nick is the ugliest fucker in existence and he is the main character. Literally, I feel the need to look away everytime he shows up on screen, he is this repulsive to me.
New year. new mark
Jesus, the new avatar jumpscared me lol. It looks awesome btw
Watch Drawn Together if you want to watch how it's done.
big mouths fan base is adults n its kinda odd lol
Big Mouth is a treat to me I grew to love it over time
I tried to give this show a chance, but had to move on to better things when I realized all it was, was: "Durr hurr hurr isn't adolescent boy issues funny? Hurr hurr hurr!".   As for the humour, it's the comedy version of a guy who shows up to work, thinks they're amazing at their job and puts in practically no effort and assumes they're so well liked that they don't have to worry about being fired.
I dunno splashdash.  Also holy shit your art style changed drastically.
Is Big mouth really that bad short answer yes
It’s like South Park without anything good
i LOATHE the thumbnail
(Also, I feel that The Hormone Monsters can choose who see them)
I love these new ls mark drawings!
I liked the show until the pillow got pregnant.  I was confused about the  rules for this show's reality to be grounded.
I like almost every season.
Damnn LS Mark soft reboot?? New art style and everything
Please change ur pfp
Yeah that video didn't change my opinion. This show is bad, I don't like edgy, gross humor
New artstyle sucks, still a banger video tho
PLEASE... THEY CANCELLED INSIDE JOB... IT WAS SO GOOD! THEY WERE BUIKLDING UP A MYSTERY AND I GOT SO MANY THEORIES THAT I AM FOREVER UNABLE TOC ONFIRM THIS SO SO FUCKED. i MISS BRETT AND REAGAN SO MUCH THEY ARE THE BEST DUO NETRFGLIX IS A SCUMBAG
Never seen this but I can't get past the art style. It makes me wanna heave 🤢
Id like big mouth a lot more if nick kroll’s obnoxious character voices werent shoved into every episode.
I wasn’t expecting a redesign for the channel, but I think it’s pretty swell
My friends all loved it and I never got it
cant believe brian griffin isnt in the thumbnail
Just a tip. If you want to watch a good show about growing up, watch sex education.
I hate the butch Hartman hands
Damn the LS Mark Series really jumped the shark when the animation changed...  Kidding of course, keep up the great content bro
The ls mark big mouth character follows me in my dreams
M
Change your logo back
Wanna know some shows with gems  Netflix used to have? The Marvel Metflix series like Daredevil & The Punisher (Keyword: "used" Disney managed to get the rights to these shows back and is in Disney+ now)
Can’t get past that they’re supposed to be teenagers
Your accent is so f***ing cute
Can’t get past that they’re supposed to be teenagers
I hate the thumbnail
I'll save you an almost 1 hr watch and answer the question posed in the title: Yes it is that bad. Goodnight everyone!
The show is not funny aside from a couple jokes but it does keep you hooked so I give it that
What is this obsession with adults and children going through puberty...?
like the new mark art style
i love love love love love this new style
Wtf happened to his avatar they'res something off
Allot of this review shows you haven't watched the show like you don't really understand the rules of the world
Big Mouth is basically legal child P,and they cancelled Inside Job.
Yes yes it is that bad
I knew this was off when you said Nick Kroll is famous for…playing the pig in Sing? Yeah, that’s not what he’s known for lmao he has a long career in comedy, so it seems like you’re already trying to belittle the people who make the show. I really do think your critiques are mostly nitpicks. It seems like a lot of things “take you out of it” lol sooo many kids are played by adults in shows, it’s part of the absurd comedy, and you also wouldn’t want real children to be saying some of the frankly repugnant lines these characters have to say. This review really does seem like you went in ready to hate it.
Huh I wasn’t expecting Marks art style change  Looks pretty good actually different but good   Oh and “Big mouth big bad”
Ls mark has changed.
With so many amazing animated shows getting cancelled because of higher ups not seeing the potential, I just find myself pissed off with shows like these getting new seasons. I just wished that people cared more about animated shows with an actual message, lore, and/or good storyline. Nowadays, if your animated show doesnt have shitty humor and easy gags, then it's most likely getting cancelled.
yo can we get a break down for F is for family like I haven't seen many people talk about it
Is that fortnite music in the background at  34:40?!?!
Yes yes it is.
Didn't southpark also have an episode where the boys and girls made lists of each other based on hotness? Not claiming they stole anything, just pointing it out that it's a concept that has been done before.
The pillow thing is what made me give up
LS Mark sounds like that inner voice that's able to share experience.
it got worse just by it's reveal
To Learn To Stop Being So Hateful, Nick Must Meet God.
The show isn't bad, it's the fact it's what netflix cancels stuff for mostly
The season 5 finale was one of the biggest "jumped the shark" moments in modern tv history.
there is something oddly traumatizing about seeing LS Mark styled as a big mouth character
Nick Kroll is a hack who only has a career because his daddy bought it for him. He's a blight on the comedy world and he needs to go.
mark do you want to be friends
I just... can't get past the look of the show. Everybody looks half furby.
It’s so jarring to see the ugly ass animation in Big Mouth and then cutting to Mark’s new beautifully drawn avatar. It feels like I’m holding my breath until LS Mark shows up.
Personally, I like the show, but I'm really good at ignoring potholes. I'm also atypical, so there was no moment of loss of innocence for me, it happened gradually.
Yes. Yes it is. I’ll never forget being forced to watch episodes of this incredibly bad show.
The ending sequence music threw me for a loop. Thank you Totally Not LS Mark.
Kevin Smith once said: _"“In Hollywood, you just kind of fail upwards."_ . That seems to apply to shows like Big Mouth, where they get both their writing and animation wrong, yet somehow the average audience member doesn't care. They're there to get their fill of crude humour and move on to the next content. Like many have said, it's infuriating to see shows that put effort and get the axe in return for their hard work, but Big Mouth gets to live on because it's the money maker.
this could have been a 2 second video of the word yes
OMG Lsmark new picture really looks so clean and epicc  Overall is really hard to have a statement of big mouth, I've only watched like some few episodes just because somebody was watching it in another house and... that's all wow.  But what I can say about is I can't relate to any of the kids, because my teen era had different conflicts, not each puberty consist in the facking and the smashing, and I can say that a show about teenagers mostly exploring sax doesn't appeal to me
Why no nonbinary hormone monster :(
The numbers game, it's all about what gets views, no matter why. Also the new channel art is awesome
i’ll b ur friend mark 😋
It feels jarring to see the new sprites and background after being used to the old one for so long
YOU LISTENED TO ME
The only adult cartoons that honestly got the weed jokes most accurate are all the MacFarlane shows Southpark to a degree and Bob's burgers these ott reaction scenes with the grass are usually portrayed when a younger character smokes which was the perception of youth at one time. Think of all the times people mentioned the pink elephant little false rumors that can make the mind think something is there you are too baked and euphoric so you just roll with it 😉 hehe roll
35:15 Of coarse not, you're the world's biggest Hoops fan
I hate how everyone only talks about a show when it gets cancelled like infinity train I’ve seen no videos about it only after it was canceled probably the same with inside job
38:58 It’s called acting. Sorry, but I don’t give 2 flying shits about who voices a character so long as it fits. Also controversial thought. I  think either everyone should be able to say the n word or no one. No halfsies.
Great review
Funnily, I've always assumed Andrew WAS the main character.
Wait, they canceled Inside Job? 😭
At least Mark v3 lives on in the end cards. (Not saying I don't like the current one btw)
Yes.
The new sprites and background look so wrong but are so good
I think most people are afraid to say they like the show but then again I also like family guy so I must be a neanderthal, Right 👍
Mark should make a video about Final Space easily one of the most underrates series ive ever seen, with beautiful animation, really fun characters and story that sadly god cancelled by netflix... obviously
Big Mouth is very strange in that it doesn't seem to have or know its audience or demographic. I know for a fact that Big Mouth is popular among tweens and teens because everyone around me is watching the new season whenever they come out. Big Mouth is oddly structured like a show for children, with very ham-fisted messages, and most having complex concepts be personified such as with how it does the whole Hormone Monster thing. But where Big Mouth started to lose me was with its 3rd and 4th season. The first 2 were admittedly crude, but ultimately harmless, but by the 3rd I genuinely think the writers of the show had let the critical acclaim get to their head and got dangerously lazy. It was from this season where EVERY emotion the characters felt had to have some metaphorical equivalent and it went off the rails quickly, "Love Bug" "Anxiety Mosquitoes", someone else put it best, this lead to the season finale where they defeated anxiety with the "Gratitode" and the way it just simplified the struggle with anxiety was horrible  ; "Big Mouth is a show that thinks that it's smart because it uses metaphors and metaphors are for smart people". I honestly agree, the show from the 3rd season downwards because more and more of the same personification nonsense and it got worse when it began to rely more and more on Meta humour and references and over indulgent soap box nonsense.  Yet there are people who genuinely love this show, and that's fine. I keep watching because it always comes out when there's nothing else to watch on Netflix and I genuinely hate the show but I am enamoured by how awful I find it.
He is always committed into looking like the same  art style as the cartoon he is talking about its almost  like a fucking persona 🤣
I’ll admit that some aspects of Big Mouth were kinda informative for me, like the discussion of birth control and whatnot, but I just wish they’d cut back on the crude humor. It might actually make for a decent educational show aimed for kids rather than making me feel like I’ve been out on an FBI watchlist.
38:27 This isn't parody, it's basically inspiration. Nice reminder that they have black writers unlike most cartoons. Also I would hang with the dude that agrees that Eeyore keeps it 💯
I really like the new art style
It and Aggretsuko shares the exact same problem. It tries to say "hey, these characters will grow and change", but also has a very odd status quo to either reset or shuffle their characters because they want to extend it in some way.
Big Mouth is a guilty pleasure for me because I do think they do some things that are good, but they also fail in a lot of areas. Overall, Human Resources is a pretty good spin-off to Big Mouth and suggest instead
Yes, yes it is
During the pandemic, I watched some of Big Mouth despite hearing about how awful the show was. I don't think I ever laughed when watching it. But I did watch a fair bit, some of series 1-3 and then most of 4. I detest the art style, voice acting, the 'jokes' and most of the plots. As you say though, there is this faint glimmer of a good concept around facing the awkward time of puberty. It's just a shame this show can't execute it well in the slightest. Shock, gross out & meta humour is so overused to the point it's all a wash of nothing. The only parts I remember liking conceptually were the depression kitty and the anxiety mosquito, as I said I watched during 2020 so they were pretty relatable elements. But the main characters Andrew and Nick are just horrible to watch. You can have flawed protagonists, but this is too far. The only human character I thought was alright was probably Matthew, maybe because he rarely interacted with the other vile characters, or because his sarcasm was a saving grace from all the other 'humour'.  Anyway, hats off to you Mark for getting through so much of it. I don't think I'll try and watch it again, I've really been trying to stop hate-watching content and just watch what I want to.
Love the new artstyle.
Please change the thumbnail I'm shaking and crying
Big Mouth is no where near as bad as people make it out to be..  they just get mad their shows get canceled instead 🙄🙄🙄
Yes
Did anyone realize he change his character design
Common misconception, laser pointers absolutely cure depression
I got tired of seeing children (even cartoon) children sexualized. I get it we all go through puberty but my goodness this show was just a lot. and I watched 4 seasons so I gave it a fair shot. Human resources though, I actually enjoy because its not focused on kids as much as Big Mouth.
Yes.
whaaaaaaaa  someone who is coming of age loves coming of age films?!
I don’t think the argument was ever that this was replacing good shows, but rather that it seems like they value this show more than the objectively better shows.
Honestly I was glad to see this review. I have seen a bunch of speculation about this series. Nice to see your covering it Mark.
Wow I like the new avatar design in these videos. You should keep em! Anyways, I don't really think about big mouth very much. I heard the first season was well-liked by critics, but I haven't really heard much after that. But from what people are saying, it's like legalized child porn, which after cuties, is something Netflix has a problem with apparently. Other than that, I don't have much to say
Very good point about the hypocrisy of a lot of media critics today. I don't know why some people are incapable of praising something without shitting on something else simultaneously.
love the new artstyle or something idk but looks better and more expressive
16:23 I’m sorry but I think it’s so funny how he says gay, “Gæh”
Bababooey
47:50 this reminds me of the third Nostalgia Critic movie. Where it's just as insufferable as a plot point
I'm super sex positive and I wish there was more realistic content about puberty that teens could watch, but this show dropped the ball so hard that it dented the floor. First of all, it is so unappealing to anyone with visual sensory organs. Im sick of adult cartoons being so ugly, especially when it doesnt fit the plot of the show. They could have just made the kids ugly to show how awful puberty is, but the adults are more ugly! Second, the kids are not written like kids and most of the puberty situations in the show are unrelatable, and a lot of them make me question the intentions of the showrunners. It just seems like it doesn't do any of the topics justice.
I’m really not a fan of this show.
It’s actually kinda crazy YouTube censors swear words
I have just never watched the show, nor have I ever had any interest in it. If other people love it, great! If other people hate it.... Great!
I could have gone my whole life without seeing a big mouth version of Mark
Bro the second I saw the community post in the big mouth style I was like oh my God
ahh the pedo show
If I had a nickel for every show that claims to tackle teenage and young adult topics as a thoughtful discussion but turns out to be a horrible, ugly, cringey pile of shit, drama, and controversy, I'd have 2 nickels, which isn't a lot but it's weird it happened twice
I like the show.
I don't hate the show nor do I love it but there's something about it I just can't stop watching it. It's like a car crash you just can't look away + I love the way Connie says bubbles
"It just works" -Todd Howard
I like the first 3 seasons honestly then it just got worse and worse
I loved bigmouth when It came out because I was the exact age as them and related to alot of the things they talked about. So because of thay it's had a special ace in my heart despite what everyone says. I acknowledge all the criticism and I even have my own criticism but its a comfort show for me at this point
Big Mouth is hexing good. Also the spinoff wasnt bad. And yes, I am 32 this year. Also yes, I have seen every episode of both.
23:36 somehow this took me more offguard than anything else in the video.
You should review Human Resources
13:51 what, how? Can someone explain it caused the dystruction of the world?
I absolutely adore the more, “ Butch Hartman” style art Mark has for his sona, it looks super appealing, and the colors pop so much! I also love the new background for his studio❤️ Keep it up Mark, what a good review vid!!
The best part about Big Mouth is that it revealed that LSMark hits that boof
I’ve never seen the show, only various clips. I’m legitimately turned on by the female hormone monster, is there something wrong with me? (22 yrs old btw)
I thought human resources was pretty good
Liking the new background design, it really pops. Your avatar's new look is also real expressive and colorful.  I do still think this show needs to quietly go away though. Like sure the concept is there but between the meta humor, the over reliance on showing all the sex shit, and the lack of properly fleshing out the actual "okay" bits its just a cluster fuck and the fact that it KEEPS GOING in spite of the fact that shows that do just as well as it, if not should be doing better, keep getting canned is devastating to think about. It just kinda sucks honestly to see so many shows dropped like garbage while this keeps getting views from casual audiences who don't want to branch out of their comfort zones. Yeah, I know its not Big Mouth's fault they're getting canned, but it feels very "picking favorite children" on Netflix's part along side Boss Baby. Still, I applaud the effort you put into doing the video and giving it a fair shake. I still don't like the show, but I respect your opinion.
As garbage as this show is the intro goes fucking hard.
Excelente review Mark, me gustan algunos momento y episodios de big mouth y en definitiva es castrate ver gente todos los días llorando de que esta serie tiene más temporadas que su serie que piratearon y que nunca compartieron con otras personas.
TY BRUH they shouldve just made the monsters a metaphor
I honestly think it's a decent show, people hate on it only because it has more seasons than most shows on Netflix. They complain about the situations the casts gets into which is understandable but Family Guy, American Dad, Rick and Morty have done similar or worse things.  Like you can criticize the show but you gotta call a spade
South Park is THE perfect example of “kids done right”
Big Mouth being the South Park to Netflix was not the takeaway I expected
They look like Raven rabbits.  also great video and I love the new art style
Hello LS the Mark great video love the new art
I just wanna thank you mark for making this video so now I don’t have to. I had this idea but I didn’t wanna suffer watching big mouth. Legend. o7.   Edit: new character design looks great. I’m so glad mark was finally able to get the arm extension surgery he needed.
Yes
>sex education >positive example  Omegalol
i could write a good episode on the dangers of smoking... by accident, me and my friend burned a dry field (the size of a football field) down when we started smoking at 14 ^^
There are too many people who are impressed by this style of show... the quality doesn't actually matter. It's the combination of grossout + meta humor wrapped up in as ugly a package as possible. Like, shows like this are automatically held up because they "tackle a difficult subject" while making random, gross, self-aware jokes.  Bonus points for the lame self-help advice that makes dopes feel good despite doing absolutely nothing of value for others.
Love the new Avatar Mark!!!
AAAAAA 4K LS MARK
like the new art style mark 👍
Big Mouth is better than it has any right to be, especially for such an ugly show. People hate it because of that and the very rough first season.  But Mark I think you've misunderstood the concept of the Hormone monster and the other personifications of human emotions and feelings that are in the show. Hormone monsters like Maury for example ARE metaphorical, they're not there, everything that looks like Maury is doing is actually Andrew cause Maury is influencing him cause he's hormones and that's kinda what they do, but at the same time there is a sort of otherworld aspect to it where Maury and the rest are kind of like fucked up shoulder angels and are assigned to different people, Nick goes through several hormone monsters before being stuck with the old one Rick for the rest of the series, if the same hormone monster is assigned to multiple people those people know about that monster and see them, Maury is assigned to Andrew, Matt and that autistic kid I can't remember the name of who being autistic is a bit behind on what Maury's deal is. I'll admit this show doesn't have super hard rules for this but in general all these characters like Maury are metaphorical.
Short answer: Yes.  Long answer: It's so bad, that it almost gave me the Black Plague.
For the weed episode in season 2 I thought that nick being paranoid was at least relatable. Of course I wasn’t seeing and hearing things but it did make me paranoid so I thought it was at least relatable
I had an English teacher in high school who considered this her favourite animated show. An English teacher! For that reason, I’ve refrained from watching or dogpiling on it, and thought it was something that appeals way more to older middle aged viewers than us zoomers. There’s probably something we’re missing, or my teacher loved dissecting the convoluted metaphors.
Shit show L take tbh ratio + cringe
Love the new fresh coat of paint you got
I won’t lie watching big mouth made me learn a lot of stuff and I started watching it when I was about 16 because that’s when it came out some of the stuff I was supposed to know or my parents was supposed to teach me didn’t and I had to find that out by TV or the Internet it gets really annoying when you can’t count on your parents to teach you stuff they’re supposed to, I mean besides taking care of me financially your only job is to teach me about the world and they can’t even do that right💯
Your new art is really nice! Good job :)
It's not the worst but the fact it's some how managed to stay up so long while other not only better but more successful shows where scrapped makes it seem so much worse. Its just try hard South Park and that's honestly not that hard. It does feel like it leans into far to much sexual stuff. Cause yes puberty can lead to confusing sexual Feelings.. But not always and it would be nice to not have to hear about characters who are literally 10 shown jacking off or worse. Idk there where better ways to go about writing this is what I'm trying to say cause I'm not saying it can't be talked about but the way they handled it was really gross and unnecessary, shocking for shocks sake I guess
congratulations on the upload
I definitely think there was a lot of effort and talent put into your new avatar, but it's such a far cry from the previous one that it feels jarring.
Personnally I never seen the show
I’m sorry, but Big Mouth is objectively terrible and indefensible.
I love the new art style
Nick kroll is a god! I love big mouth
The reason why I used to like Big Mouth but then later HATE that show is because the premise and humor was such a mess and confusing to watch as the seasons progress.
16:57 thank you! meta humor is really getting lazier and lazier with time, you can practically smell the writers sniffing their own butt when they write those "jokes" imagining how they will go viral on the internet
I thought most of the time only the kid could see the monster
The new sprites look awesome!!
I thought you said sheem wizard
I was always curious about the show, but I never watched it because I found the art style to be just that unappealing.
nice new look. 😏👌
Yes
Ya, I can't see myself ever liking this show.
It's not as bad as people say  it's ok but not horrible
38:37 then why is Jordan peele voicing a white character
Mark has shadows. He’s come so far
Nice
Like the new art style
Rank every single aqua teen hunger force episode there are 11 minutes long and there’s like 100 episode you can probably do that in like two hours video
Big mouth is basically animated cheese pizza. People act like just because it’s animated it’s ok, but it’s entire goal is to explicitly show childrens sexuality and that is disgusting. That’s why so many people hate it
37:17 Bababooey
The creator of the show actually looks like a big mouth character
33:30 markiplier reference
Counterpoint, laser pointers are awesome
To clarify, I'm not on the cancel big mouth wagon, I'm just pointing out why people aren't as willing to defend it. If u like it, that's fine.
The “kids not sounding like kids” issue is in no way exclusive to this show. The biggest example I can think of is Dipper in Gravity Falls.  Edit:in relation to the meta humor, the only good examples of it I can think of are the Deadpool comics, Chowder, and The Amazing World Of Gumball.
This show really needed one producer to say no to some ideas. Overall there are some cool concepts and funny bits but it feels like none of the writers have ever been told “hey that’s dumb actually”. Also I like the new avi model you use Mark.
I like the new Mark drawing style
THAT PFP LOOKS AMAZING
A Big Mouth Christmas was fun...although the elves segment was a bit much...all in all i enjoy this series and while i kay not love all the jokes and scenery...it was an ok series and im glad it got a spinoff with a good season and an upcoming 2nd season!
Yes.... Yes it is
770th
3:27 that looks foul
It’s good to know that LS mark is still alive
Big marth
now THAT'S a visual upgrade!
Not a fan of the new Avatar/Sprite Mark ngl. Maybe it'll grow on me but eh
I fuck with it its lowkey funny sometimes but it could be to much around other people who don’t watch it lmao
the new ls mark stits are soooo good! youve improved so much! They look so expressive and colorful! is gonna take some getting used to tho tbh
I'm dead serious when I say that I am sure something will come out about someone behind this show, like Justin roiland and Dan Schneider combined
I hate the "they worked hard on it" excuse. Let me put it bluntly, something can have a huge amount of effort put in, and it can be garbage.
33:31 POV: Markiplier
It made Netflix cancel Inside Job. So yeah, Big Mouth is bad.
Is that even a question
Binge American dad for the channel you coward
I find it creative, funny and dumb (and sometimes smart) and I like that lol.
I actually love Big mouth. It is shocking how far they go and it works. Also I love the new avatar. It Is unique but I will miss the old avatar
oh dude if big mouth did anything right its matthew.
This video is my biggest experience with big mouth and it doesn't sound that bad I think I'll give it a try.
I had to give a like just for Tekken 5 music alone...
I find it interesting how you bring the people who seems to defend every single animated show regardless of how poorly animated it is saying "people put so much effort into this" and their hypocrisy by shitting on hated shows, why I find it interesting? Because I haven't seen one of those weirdos in ages, maybe they are way more common on the English side, side I'm usually ignoring because they are infinitely more annoying with everything (specially in the middle of debates).   Anyways, time to continue watching the video of a series I never watched because of obvious reasons.
i like the new artstyle
I can’t watch a video defending big “miowth”
Shame Wizard and Gratitoad rocks!!
The rare Uncle Grandpa W. Everyone I know always shits on that show
I mean I personally don’t like sexualizing child characters so I’ll go out on a limb and say yes, it is that bad
Big Mouth can honestly be pretty good when it's not doing gross out humour, I think Jessie's depression is handled really well - it's just a shame that's a good portion of it, especially earlier seasons, which makes it especially hard to defend publicly
For me only season 1 and 2 exist and after that there's only whatever 5/10 adult cartoon which is not worth your time at all
I hate big mouth because people say I sound like Andrew
I wanna know which writer fucked the shit out of pillows growing up, and ask em if they're okay.
27:36 so sad that Mark and SplashDash had a falling out...
I've never seen Big mouth a day in my life but I always thought the blue shirt kid was the main protagonist, not the Glasses kid
No, it's worse.
yes
I've watched the first few seasons of Big Mouth. It's fine. Not a terrible show by any means. Reminds me a lot of Family Guy after the first several seasons, where it's not phenomenal but still has a lot of jokes that land. It is, however, a great showcase of the problems with adult animation. A relatively good comedy with a crude art style, writing that's vulgar and "mature", frequently relies on shock value, and does nothing particularly new. It's the same shit we've been getting for decades now
Big mouth is satanic perverted filth
Why do they have big mouths?
As for the animation fans are hypocrite argument, I think the borderline cp stuff is the main prob. Other shows like south park don't go too far. Usually at least.
As a teenager going through most of this stuff its very relatable and helps knowing that everybody is going through this stuff thats why I love it at least
yes
I liked Bog Mouth maybe not season 1 but i find this show at least better then current Family guy
I've always seen the... will say "baaaaaaaad" stuff in this show as mostly for shock factor. I obviously dislike the noodity, but when this show tackles social issues it NAILS them. Missy with her racial identity, Devon's song on "code switching", the ups and downs of each parents relationship. Also, Nick Kroll is on Seth Macfarlane levels of music on his shows. (Something television is lacking) I understand not wanting to watch Big Mouth tho, and if the "bad is too much, PLEASE at least try Human Resources. That is proof Kroll doesn't need the "teens" to write a great show. (excuse weird spellings, trying to make sure YT doesn't delete the comment for language)
Yes
I think it's obvious that they done that artstyle on purpouse. I never get why people don't get that honestly I get not liking It but at least acknoledge that that what they we're going for. And look I can't see when a show look ugly on purpouse and one that It just bad, like "The Prince"
Coach Steve >>>>>>>Peter Griffin
I am here to thank marks editor in their taste for Tekken music, specifically dark ressurection
TLDR yes it is and its grosser than you thought.
Big mouth Mark is something I never needed to see.....
hit take alret but i don't like the lgbt
strange how this video from my favorite reviewer is posted right in the middle of my Big Mouth existential crisis. i feel i should elaborate.. im torn between hating it based on a vague and probably inaccurate memory from watching it years ago, or actually watching it again to see what I really think. and the only reason I give a shit is because my beloved, John Mulaney, is the voice of the protag. i have faith Marky poo will settle this great storm in my head. edit: what i took from this video is that Nick is actually the protag. i never got that impression but alright !
The only way I can explain this show as an excuse to be pedophilic while masking it as a show. This show isnt portrayed as a normal thing, it genuinely has shit that shouldnt be shown or done next to or with kids. And people are so used to it they dont even question it. It's vile
Unsubscribed big mouth style avatar is too cursed
quick thing btw, around the valentines day special; there were going to be Big Mouth valentine's day cards given out at Spencer's but the promotion was cancelled, so they werent given out. (i have pictures of them)
Is it just me or is the way the hands are drawn on mark super distracting? The Perlicue (skin between the thumb and index finger) is unnaturally rounded instead of curved inwards. It just looks off.
I love the new LS Mark sprites holy moly that deserves a sub
Honestly, this show seems like another case of "Good ideas, Botched execution". It seems like when it works it works! When it doesn't it  justs hurts.  I mean, I do commend it for having the cojones to tackle the subject material it does, but on the other hand it does feel like it tries too hard to be shocking. Also, I somewhat agree that blaming this show for others getting canned is somewhat petty.(A lesson young Me should of learned years ago.)
Worst part about the abortion episode, it spreads misinform about Olán parent hood
off topic but I am LOVING the new mark art and background, it’s so cozy 🤤🤤❤️
Yes it’s that bad
Message to Mark's editor: you should check out the REROLL YOUR SOUNDTRACK isaac album. I love hearing the excelsior and antibirth songs in here btw.
Do Human Resources
Big Mouth more like Loud Mouth
missy isn’t black she’s mixed race
Wow your video art style has really improved! Looks great 👍
Nice job on the vid! Btw, I really like the channel overhaul 👍
The only episode I like is the weed episode and I am ashamed to say that I know it by heart. Me and my best friend used to watch that episode everytime we smoked. Maybe that explains why we liked it lol
I have a idea for the names of the two mark designs, Classic & Modern Mark, I don't know it just seems fitting.
Love the show, it has some moments I wish were in better taste, but I definitely went through half the shit these kids did. It felt real, these are real experiences that we go through growing up.
I think when it comes to the hormone monsters they're only seen by people affected by them, aka kids going through puberty. nick doesn't see maury until maury decides to appear visible to nick in season 1. same with everyone else. I also think the show should've ended at season 5, I dont think the meeting of nick birch and nick Kroll was a necessarily bad idea, but j feel like once you make your main character fully aware his world isn't real you cant continue the story after that. it would've been a fine series finale. I still like big mouth but its getting worse over time
This got over 4 seasons, but Inside Job got cancelled
Look, the show is bad, but as a person that used to hump pillows, I guess I see what they were doing with Jay
I guarantee everyone who works for netlfix wants the age of consent to be lowered by alot bloody disgusting pigs
LS Mark smoking weed, that sounds like a great idea
I tried to watch big mouth years ago but I couldn't get past the first episode bc it makes me really uncomfortable, I was a minor when I watched it btw, I hate seeing all the sexual parts.
Big Mouth actually had decent asexual representation from what I've heard, something that hasn't been done in an adult cartoon since Bojack Horseman. It's also nice to see them be comfortable enough to label a preteen/teen "asexual" for once, I remember being told that I'd understand when I got older or I'd crave sex if I found the right person...nearly a decade of identifying as asexual and that hasn't happened yet.
I never watched the show the art style is so unappealing to me. The art style gave me family guy vibes as in a bad adult cartoon.
Love the new character avatar mark. 👌 its looking really nice
Lmao aren't you the guy who called one of the GameGrumps hosters wife a corpse?
The new artwork is amazing, very stylized and very pleasing to look at.
LS Marks longer arms scare me
TLDR: Yes, it’s a shitty adult cartoon for people that consume 40 Benadryls
I hate progressive shit man
nice new avatar! looks much cleaner than the one before with the more defined shapes and such!!
a dumb trans kid nice
That thumbnail makes me viscerally angry and disgusted
WOW! I love the new style on your avatar, looks WAY cleaner and cartoonish!
How. How do you release near-hour long videos like every 2 weeks.
Yes, next question
F is for Family review when?
Yes. It is.
Inside job Is my favorite series in this new decade. and I'm extremely upset they  took it off Netflix just to put out more garbage ._.
I wouldn't even aknowlage and criticism from someone who used a dumb wee face at the end of there message like >_< etc
currently on your reaction to season one. oh god does that meta-humor get worse as the series goes on, especially on the last seasons
I guess you could name this video “Big Mark”
Short Answer: YES
listen this show is kinda ass but I thoroughly enjoy watching it because of how extraordinarily stupid it all is
really liking the new art your using
Andrew reminds me of Brian from Family Guy. He starts off as somewhat intelligent and caring, and then suddenly he's a hateful scumbag in the next season.
16:58 I mean even rick and morty now hates it
You just had to stretch it over the 10 minute mark huh, Mark.
Waffle house has found it's new host
Oh holy shit, new stills
That's the scariest thumbnail I've ever seen
Yes *video ends*    In all seriousness the show is pretty ok
I think the annoying pansexual girl is  pritty on point alot of quirky kids who make stupid lgbt stuff there whole personality act like that
Your style changed.
F yeah! F is for family is awesome!
Cursed Thumbnail
off topic but these new sprites are really scratching my brain in the right spots
The new ls mark avatar makes me wanna cry
your new character design looks GREAT
Great vid bro.😺
yeah kinda
Yes
Haha the censor sounds actually make it funnier
I personally find the show better and funnier bc of the fact that they sound like adults but look like kids. If they used forced tween voices or kid’s voices it would’ve been more uncomfortable than it already is
cant believe nick kroll ripped off doug walker meeting the nostalgia critic in to boldly flee
36:08 how tf do u know exactly how a 1-5 scale works? Are u Swedish pretending to be Irish?
this show feels like family guy but more awkward and cringe
yes
Love the updated visuals!
(sorry for my bad English)...i just watched 1 episode of the show and for what i see is just not my type...the humor the plot and the artstyle... especially the repugnant artstyle(if wasn't for the ugly artstyle and the abundance of male boys it could pass as a decent loli h*ntai because (interpretating John carmack quote) who cares for the plot of a decadence movie( a.k.a porn))
personal i think this program is stupid tbf i think most netlfix originals are stupid but i am a grown man maybe it's good if your a super woke 12 year old or something i don't know
Bigmouth is what happens if you had given the south park guys free reigns when they first started out
Why does LS Mark says Gay like Gaeh? He pronounces gay the same way Chris Chan did when he didn't wanted to say the word gay
@Lsmark I’m always sitting here laughing at these shows getting canceled because of how many of these shows have liberal, progressive and democratic ideologies in their shows witch alienates more than 50% of us fan bases witch is why a lot animated shows these days get cancelled.
idk about others but my depression is also somewhat taken away by laser pointers.... my cats love to play with lasers so seeing them play and be happy is how i take away my depression
I'm loving the new desk and profile picture.
Y e s .
The thumbnail alone answers your question
noone wants to admit they watch it but we all do
Big Mouth looks gross so I don’t even want to give it the chance
I’ve never seen big mouth before, probably wont ever watch it but interesting Also love the new art style, looks great!
When I first saw this show, I never understood its dry morbid humor but I have to say it could use a better concept and a genuine story not just sexual fever dreams especially not with a pillow.
Nick Kroll is a nepotism baby and his dad made millions harassing abuse victims!! His dad worked for Harvey Weinstein!!
I love the new art style Mark, it’s very appealing
I like the upgraded animation on Mark’s avatar. It looks really nice!
Nice new artstyle dude, loving the new look
Yes
This show had potential, and it was realized to an extent, but it could’ve been better.
To save you guys your time: Yes. Yes it is.
holy shit the new avatar you have is so much better
I lost my virginity with this show playing in the background…
DAMN, this new editing style looks great!
Love your new icon
Is not that bad if you compare woth other show.
holy moly you r looking great this year mark
I watched this show for the first time on acid with a new freind. When it got to the basketball penis game it started weirding me out way to much, just sitting in silence tripping on acid with this dude I barely know watching these highly detailed dicks flop around a basketball court.
UPDATED ART STYLE IM LIKING IT
Yes. Yes it is that bad. It's the same jokes week after week. If you want a good animation Netflix show you gotta go with Bojack. If you like toilet humor then Bojack isn't for you
babe babe wake up new art style
I did not like Big Mouth, I hated Nick's ugly design and hated how he did not at all sound like a kid, not to mention all the gross out humor and over reliance on sex jokes.. BUT I did enjoy Human Resources. Maybe it's because the focus was less on the kids and more on a funny monster world.  Btw love the new avatar design Mark ❤

This isn't what I ordered, send it back to the chef
TBH I almost do care if it’s a good show, it looks so ugly that I don’t want to have to look at it
neat (new) art style! My friends have been constantly pestering me to watch this show and sending me clips but just looking at the clips alone..  no
I always forget he Canadian 1:16
I know it's not animation but I'd love to see Mark do a Malcolm in the middle video
I don't know, never watch it due to the hideous artstyle.
I genuinely LOVE big mouth, and I agree with that it made me feel less alone,,, plus I like the random humor honestly I like that it doesn’t take itself seriously!! It’s honestly one of my favorite shows
Yes.
Have you watched flcl. Silly coming of age
Yes
Mark:  Is big mouth THAT bad?!, Well these hypocritical animation lovers are just over reacting. After the video “ Yeah it’s that bad.”
Oh it’s awful It’s one of the only shows I regret watching it’s so cringe
I used to think it was good them I had a reality check
How did LS mark go from 5 to 10 minute videos, to 20 and literally one hour long videos?
I actually loved Nick Kroll (and pretty much everyone) in the The League.   That is what I have to contribute to this discussion. Big Mouth is meh.
I like the touch ups to the puppet
I’m of course going to watch the whole video, but honestly I don’t care if Big Mouth is the greatest show ever made, I think it’s disgusting and that’s coming from someone who doesn’t really get offended or uncomfortable by a lot of things. I’m extremely insensitive in the worst way possible.
To be fair the director family are  literally billionaire
Can’t wait for the 7 hour anal sis of every episode ranked
I tried giving the show a chance on a few occasions. Please time I barely made it through an episode before I had to turn it off. It's really hard to watch and it's a downright choir at at times.
To me, all the arguments in the world can be made about the actual series,  but I find the concept is just impossible for me to enjoy.  A show that is basically just about kids talking about puberty and their genitalia isn’t enjoyable to me in the slightest and nothing the show does ever shakes that from me.  It’s like one piece to me, it could be the greatest piece of media ever, but a 1000 episode long series will always be unappealing to me.    I get that animation communities can be very hypocritical, but I really dislike seeing big mouth, a show that really doesn’t need more episodes, get a new season over shows like inside job.  There are worse shows out there and It’s fine for everyone else to Like the show, but I won’t pretend that I enjoy it in the slightest.
This show is a fucking warcrime
Hell nah I'm not going through 50:00 minutes of Big Mouth. *LEAVE*
Netflix cant handle when there show dosent have lgbt representation for 3 minutes (they need it for rating)
honestly i think the problem with the show's visuals is that it has a uniquely, likely intentionally ugly art style juxtaposed with a completely bland and generic animation style. other "ugly" cartoons like south park or 12 oz mouse work despite looking ugly because the animation complements the art direction, so even if they look weird they're interesting to look at because there aren't other cartoons that look quite like them. big mouth is just another generic adult animated sitcom with abhorrent character designs emphasized by bland animation that takes no creative risks whatsoever
Wtf why did you draw that?
I never thought I’d see Mark’s avatar as a big mouth character it’s so cursed I’m terrified no god please-
Honestly I never watched it for one reason,the animation style looks ugly as shit to the point where it is unwatchable for me.
Any cartoon that makes me feel like a paedo is alright in my book. 🤔😕
It’s not about whether it’s a good show or not, it’s the fact that other shows were canceled before it was. Just baffles me how Netflix was like “alright you can stay” lmao
The animation is beautiful. It's making me cry, though my tears are red. Wait, I think my eyes are bleeding.
Like the new look man
2:15 i dont like BM but i have friends who do i never get this whole drawing squiggly lines with media they all act like it alllllll must be high art of the most complex expression.
i am so so sad abput inside job being canceled
If you enjoy Big Mouth, you're most likely not welcome within 100 feet of school property.
Love the new artwork on display mark!
Big mouth is funny yeah its crude but people can't take jokes anymore
Honestly? I can completely agree with what your assessment was about the show overall (in the sense that it tries to do a lot of cool and unique stuff and that it tackles interesting topic matters that a lot of people can relate to but it doesn't personally sit right with you) For me, it was also like that, though I gave up after that episode in season 2 where they sing about n*ked bodies.
The background is insane its so filled with detail everywhere you look you see easter eggs to marks favorite shows with this one possessing depth the old ones where good but this one is great I think this new change was for the best
Big mouth ls mark, isn't real big mouth ls mark isn't real
I like the new animation
Mark should set his pfp to the big mouth version of his oc its literally better, superior, beautiful, stunning
Short answer it's worse
Love the new art style!!!
I love big mouth. I find it super relatable most of the time. Very creative as well
It's Tuesday. Don't worry about it. Just enjoy the humor 😅 at least that what I do
I feel like they took a lot of Rodger powers for hormone monster.
I didn't hate the first season. I felt like it was a worthwhile, frank look at the difficulties of puberty. But it felt like it was already out of breath by the end of S1 and I didn't need anymore of it.
Mark in the big mouth style is the worst thing I’ve ever fucking seen
It looks incredibly unappealing. Also I personally I never really liked nick kroll.
Yes
Yes
The waffle house has found its new host.
I absolutely love watching this show it is hilarious. I don't get the hate. 🤷I mean it's not perfect, but it's not horrible.
I’d love to see you talking about Bobs Burgers, as it’s my favourite cartoon right now
love the new background animation and stills
Are you depressed but a laser pointer lol
tl;dr yes
Looks like LS Mark got Rebel Taxi'd
**sees thumbnail** thanks, I hate Big Mouth Mark!
*LS MARK PLEASE TALK ABOUT DREAMWORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!*
This video made me realize how good this show could’ve been
I actually like how F is For Family looks
I think it's good 76% of the time, which is way way more than i can say about other teen shows on netflix
I’m not a fan of it but it’s comedy 🎭it’s really funny
...This show still exists?
I never Really watched this show cause It came out before my puberty and when It started i had Allready forgor about it
I would say it's not as bad as your Velma's, The Prince, Hoops or anything the Brickleberry people touch, but it never can stay consistently competent for me. Any interesting scenes or actually decent jokes or somewhat well thought out scenes always have something else preceding and proceeding it that make it get on my nerves so much personally. The final draw for me was in the fourth season they turned it into a crappy CW-esque drama with gross out. I can see why people liked the first two and even third seasons but don't know how anyone can enjoy it now. It's about the same quality as the modern Simpsons and Family Guy to me.
Back 2 Back & What U Need Is Remix (Main Menu) from Sonic Rush, Unknown From M.E. (Knuckles' Theme Song) from Sonic Adventure 2, Press Garden Act 1 from Sonic Mania, and Dreamer from Streets of Rage 2?! 😱 Solid choices LS Mark! 😊👍🏿
the thumbnail face is extremely disturbing
YES! *ends the video*
Yes, next question
bruh why the fuck is mark 3d now
26:42 and yet Ironically I'd found the Spin-off Show of Human Resources a lot more entertaining then the actual Show of Big Mouth
mabye the monster guy (im not checking what his name is because i don't give a shit) is like how sometimes the adults can understand stewie in family guy, sometimes they see him but sometimes they don't
This show was hard to watch someone review let alone actually watch it, you're a trooper for watching it.
I like how Ls mark new avatar is introduced,he going through changes... Wwait a minute does that mean we going to se mark jerking o...
It's so hideous that I had to click this video to leave this comment just so that the thumbnail would leave my feed, I'll put it that way
If anyone else had told me that they just watched all 62 episodes of Big Mouth within the week I would demand that they be put on an FBI watchlist immediately
i seriously cant watch this the show looks so bad
Actually, my huge hate of the show has been slightly changed from this video. I think if the rules of it's universe were more consistent and not so "family guy absurdity"-esque, I think I would have enjoyed the show a little.
I never new people disliked the show? Every one I know loves it
hi! you should do a video about Futurama I love futurama a lot
Yes. IT IS AWFUL
Love the new stills!
Yes yes it is
Listen, I was watching this show from the begining and I can tell you full stop the valentines day special was Indeed not originally a part of season 3 and Instead Its own thing even being listed as such In the season select
thumbnail is terrifying
"Is it really that bad"  Yes, end of video.
I like the show. I at least find it funny 🤌🏻
I completely didn't realize the new art style in the portrait of the last video too. Nice look G.
Ok did LS Mark do drugs
The answer is yes. The premise was novel at first and quickly wore off.
I can say the spin off of big mouth is a lot better in my opinion with storytelling
Genuinely think this is the first time where the rebrand of a channel I like turned out amazing with no issues
Okay I REALLY like your new look here It’s really clean and detailed my dude  Also, as somebody who doesn’t mind Big Mouth (I actually enjoy it, but I cover my eyes at the gross parts) I’m glad you did a video on this! And I completely agree with every point you made. I think the idea is really creative but I feel it could have been better. Like. A lot better. I like the comparison you made with the Fairly Odd Parents, I never would have thought of it that way actually. I hope season 7 does better than the past ones. I think they have the right idea with what message they have, all the different kids going through their own problems and such, with Andrew having an abusive father, Jay having EXTREMELY neglectful and abusive parents and bad role models being his brothers, Jessie going through her parents divorce and getting a new step parent, Nick being spoiled rotten with good parents but kinda just being a brat about everything, Mindy going through her own journey figuring herself and her culture out, and Matthew having a not-so-supportive mother when it comes to him being gay. It’s a lot of great stories with their own things going on that we could learn from, the idea of the show is really good, but again, I definitely agree with how it’s exactly done. They go off track way too often and it definitely gets chaotic and WAY too gross.   Great video so far Mark! Im almost finished with watching it here. You absolutely make a lot of good points.  And again. LOVE the new sprite design.
this characters remind me of smosh babies
Yeah, it is
This show could have the best writing in the world but my god I hate the art style so much
I love the new character stills
Mark that thumbnail is cursed man
yes, yes it is.
yes, it is.
Ls mark profile change
I like this show when it came out I just came out of middle school into freshmen year and still watched even out of high school worst season have be 2 and 4 2 was bit boring but season 4  was ehhh yeah
Yeah it is. Alright, now let's watch the video.
I don’t really think it’s That BAD
At this point for me yes. I really enjoyed season 1, it was incredibly relatable and funny. I also liked season 2, but beyond that I feel like the show has dipped in quality and has gotten uncomfortable…
My brother loved the show and had me watch the first 2 seasons with him, which is nice since it means when I say I hate this show people can’t say I never gave it a chance.
I think the reason why all the characters look like fish is because if they actually resembled humans, the show creators would be in jail.
I has its fans so I’d like to say that I’d trade in Paradise P.D. and Farzar if it meant Inside Job could be able to end on its own terms.
Sorry for the new rules for youtube. It is gonna get worse if they ban all swear words in general.
I absolutely adore the new design for the channel ♥️
Yes yes it is I dropped half way through the first season because if I watched anymore I would have put a bullet in my skull
Mark who do you main in tekken
This series could have been a genuinely great show if it wasn't comedy and took itself seriously. I feel like so many ideas, like this hormone monster thing, get ruined by the crew wanting to make it into a comedy show instead of an actual story.
let me save you all an hour: Y E S
You're now officially Irish Hate Everything congratulations
My man has that Windows 11 icon shading in his new channel profile picture
dear god mark is so tall now
I binge the show and I will answer that yes it's bad. But I can't stop now. I'm too far in. Also nee art Mark? Nice
Yes.
Good video
The show is disgusting trash and I'm gonna continue to judge the shit out of anyone who tries to tell me otherwise
they could've had an Ike type situation with kids voice acting and like saying all the shit uncensored
54:19 Wow, great Animation Style. Literally 10 Times better than what you´re reviewing.
I watched it when it first came out, didn’t like the first season but as the show went and they made jay bisexual I honestly related to his struggle of accepting himself  yeah him and Mathew are the only parts of the show I really like, ig as a gay lil teen I just like them a lot
I hate this new animation!!! Go back to the old one
ranking of Big Mouth Seasons:  1st- Season 2 2nd- Season 3 3rd- Season 1 4th- Season 5 5th- Season 4 6th- Season 6(WORST SEASON EVER!!!!)
Love the new character stills!
Personally, I enjoy Big Mouth. It's not perfect but I think it has heart to it and tries to convey good messages to its audience. I honestly think it's a really good concept and they waste some potential by breaking rules with their world building all the time like Mark was saying in his review. I tend to watch this show and think "this would be a good idea if they did it differently." I don't know, I like what they are going for. This show can be funny by how ridiculous it is. I honestly cried in parts of the show especially human resources when they did get their emotional moments right.
Yes.  Yes, it is.
351st
Loving these new talk sprites, also good video, Mark!
2:19 I said the same thing about gaming fans when it comes to Pokemon. They talk about how bad crunch development is, but as soon as it's Pokemon the devs are just lazy apparently.
Yes it is! Thanks for watching my video please remember to like this video and subscribe!
Man this new visual style for the channel looks great! Props to the artist you hired, they did an awesome job!
Short answer: Yes Long answer: Yes it is  Nick Kroll is so unfunny. Where F is for Family shines is that Bill Burr is *actually* funny.
Its crazy how nick krolls dad in real life is like a zillionaire so the show will never die
Dead end and inside job were bangers
WTF WHY DO YOU HAVE 5 FINGER S
you are addicted to watching every episode of a show
This is one cursed thumbnail mark
yes it is, there saved you and hour
I actually like the show
I like big mouth. Its one of my comfort adult cartoon. Yes its cringey but its a show i like to watch with my brain off. If you get me.
At least you can tell they tried, even if the attention to detail is pretty clearly not there, they tried. I guess
No it’s really not lol I guess it depends on your tolerance of gross out
Bro turned 3d
Screw big mouth (I never watched it)
NO its not that bad is it Gross YES but it has Great Messages and Hilarious Premises I Really do like this show!!
Loving to new art style for the avatar! Sick stuff
Loving the new art style man!
I can understand why some might defend the show but Jesus Christ the art style is so bad that I can’t even look at it for more than a few seconds.  I get why it’s the case but it just makes it completely unwatchable for me
I really like This new art style, looks very stylish and cool, especially the background
Loving the new sprites! The colors pop so much and the lineart is super smooth!! I really think that the style of your new sprites would look great in an early 2000s cartoon.
YES. Its actual GR00MER bait. Its a disgusting show.
I think they'd get should give Big Mouth a Small Mouth
Yes.
I don't know if it's bad because I never watched it. I'm just a very visual person so I can only watch something when the art style appeals to me. I didn't watch the Avatar movies because the aliens look ugly and I don't wanna watch Big Mouth because if every second I see characters whose look I don't like I feel like cringing then I won't watch it.
THERES SIX SEASONS?!?!?!
DID THEY FUCKING CANCEL DEAD END!?!?!?!?!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Can you do Moral Orel next?
1:47 its still like that
There is worse out there. That is for sure. I have never watched Big Mouth but it can’t be absolutely horrible. There are many shows out there that are worse than this. Also, love the new style of your OC Mark. It looks awesome
Yes
LS Mark is looking HD
i think the personification of puberty grosses people out, i think the actual writing and jokes can be funny its just the premise can make the scenarios look he characters are in cringe. i think if the shiw had a different facade, ppl would t find it so offensive. u can tell ppl fr tried to make a funny show with sumthin to say abt sumthin we all went thru. its not b a d but not incredible either. its fine. i think nick is very funny and u can see it in this weird ass show. at least its not stupid JUST to be stupid
Unrelated note, but Mark’s new sprites remind me of the CyberChase art style for some reason.
Honestly the show gets both laughs and eyerolls from me.
The new avatar looks 👌
Big Mouth has its moments and can be funny but I think overall it's just ok. It's not necessarily a masterpiece but it's not the awful thing people online think it is. It's not my thing but I wouldn't fault someone for liking it.
Velma vs Big Mouth Vs Rick and Morty  Battle of the worst
I LOVE YOU LS FART
Nice new look mark I like it👍
Big mouth is bad, but I wanna see it get worse
holy fuck does the new artstyle look amazing
The new avatar design is such a huge upgrade from the last one.
I think the humor is in poor taste but the show itself existing doesn't bother me.
this redesign goes hard
I was hoping the video would just be “yes” then a black screen for the rest of it.
love the new artstyle but RIP the spongebob snowglobe that used to be in your backgrounds lmao
big mouth sucks, the mouths should have been bigger
Go back to the old set up
It really depend of the person. I have a friend who is obsessed with it and recommended it to me but the humor just didn’t stick with me. I also understand why teens would like it since it’s all about teen experience, but nothing can excuse that gross art style Also, I really liked the new avatar in the newer videos, the design is just overall more clean
Yes.
What kills this for me is that the characters don't age. It's a show about puberty, an age defines by change and yet they look the same in season 6 than in season 1.  They're loosing the chance to explore how puberty truly changes you.
Man the english voices are not good, i see the show on latin spanish, the voices are more of teens instead of adults
I think that the people who hate bigmouth have never seen it. they listen to what people say on the internet and see the art style and immediately hate it. and while yes, a lot of the jokes are immature, but a lot of bigmouth can be really meaningful. a lot of them really overreact to the aspect of them being children and it being based around puberty and sexuality. people see anything that moderately relates to sex as something sexual. its not meant to be sexual, its meant to be relatable. its about the same struggles everyone went through as a teen (minus the supernatural aspects) and while sometimes the rules of the world dont exactly add up and the art style is downright atrocious, i do think that people genuinely put time, effort, and love into this show in order to make it meaningful to their stories and the experience of their viewers. its a passion project about the childhood of the creators, and it was made with actual love, which is something i cant say about shows like family guy
When I was first hearing about the show, I always thought the point about the, "there's a monster next to you!" line was a nitpick because the kid is clearly supposed to be atypical. But then, watching the show you realize, no. It's not just the weird kid for that one-off joke, it's just anyone whenever they feel like it (7:32)
Just watch bluey it's good for adults
Tbh I wouldn’t have minded the show at all if Netflix wasn’t praising it like crazy. I swear, every streaming service or channel wants to be like Nickelodeon.
hi
It’s not the worst thing out there, but I still don’t understand why people like it when there are plenty of better shows out there.
This rebranding looks awesome! Wish I had more to say but I just really like it.
the only time I've ever heard of Nick Kroll was that he starred in the Captain Underpants movie.
I like Big Mouth, it can be funny.
3:47 here. You know what it's for.
Honestly I really like big mouth
0:22 Babe wake up, new LS Mark background and stills dropped
WOAH, this new art style is amazing! I love it!
I compare the hatred for Big Mouth to the internet’s hatred for The Emoji Movie, both Netflix and Sony canceled projects the internet loved, so they shit on projects they don’t like out of anger! Edit: yeah nevermind got to the part of season 4, no wonder this show is hated.
I've watched the show (sadly) but caleb is the best character. I have no bias
holy new mark artstyle
Not sure what’s the exact appeal of it, but I suppose with the amount of seasons it has gotten there clearly must be an audience for it somewhere.
Pillow babee funeee
And yet I'd still do like Big Mouth
I’m not sure how to feel about the new design I kinda like it and I kinda don’t but I don’t know
NEVER FORGET that big mouth is one of the most highly rated TV shows of all time
I think the biggest reason why Big Mouth is so hated is because it keeps getting more and more seasons while other (clearly better) Netflix animations are even lucky to get just one season
5:03 WAIT YOU FORGOT ON-
It’s not a ranking video, but I’ll take it.
"Big Mouth LS Mark doesn't exist, he can't hurt you" Big Mouth LS Mark:
Yes,yes it is
I feel like most people just misses the point on why the designs are so ugly. I'm pretty sure it was done on purpose to prevent the 13 years old characters in sexual situations to look attractive; and from there, it's easy to grasp why they shouldn't be attractive
Here before demonitization
I hate big mouth cos of how much it shows when they're like actually 13 or whatever
It’s gonna take a wild to get used to you’re new style, but I think I’ll get used to it.
I had literally just shown my friend the part in the Season 5 finale where Nick meets IRL Nick Kroll yesterday. Cuz like that's basically the whole show's existence encapsulated in one (broken up) scene. I've been putting actual effort in trying to understand the sheer hatred for this series, so it's really cool to see someone else with a similar media literacy attempt the same thing!
Short answer, Kinda
do american dad
the answer is yes. but i'll watch the video anyway
Yes
Wtf is this new jpeg?! Or png?
I really enjoyed season one. Every season get way worse though
186th comment
Gonna say I love the new design for Mark. I don't know it's more let's say cute and friendly looking. No offense
189
I think Justin Bieber’s baby is one of the best songs for all time.
Big Mouth is a masterpiece for anyone who likes it, and an abomination for anyone who dislikes it. It's practically impossible to feel neutral about it. I like Big Mouth. But people who don't should give Human Resources a chance.
its literally child porn the show it needs to be wiped off the planet
The one thing i can appreciate about big mouth is that at LEAST it can be crap without ruining an original source material
Seeing Mark as a Big Mouth character has scarred me
Wow the art changed that cool
short answer yes
You are so cool 😎
im unsubbing not because i dislike the video i havent even watched it but you making me see that thumbnail should be a criminal offense
The newer seasons yes it’s actually bad. The older ones were pretty decent tbh
OMG I LOVE UR NEW CHARACTER DESIGN :DD
My favorite part of big mouth is when he said “it’s biggin’ time” and then bigged all over the mouth
Make a video about Koala Man
This redesign is so good. Very colorful.
I miss Mark's old avatar already
Yes
The new art style is really cool, props to the animator
I like Big Mouth better when Big Mouth pizza said by some kid was used in YTP Sexer. The series is overhated, but Netflix should do better with cartoons. At the very least they always kept their trust with Adi Schumar and Warren Ellis.
I really like the new LS Mark avatar I really love to see it more on new recent videos
The Thumbnail is cursed xD
Video on the live-action Garfield movies, pls! 😁😁😁😻🧡  “It’s good to be king!” 👑
ur new art style is so cute i love it
No, it's even worse
ls mark Have you watched Hey Arnold
Lovin the new artstyle Mark
First LS mark video with the new style.
I cannot believe they made mark's desing slight more ponty, they RUINED everything, i'll BURN 7 churches DOWN, this CANNOT be HAPPENING
It’s really not that bad. And the moral outrage about it is so annoying and I wish people would just shut up and let the show run it’s course. Like seriously I don’t wanna keep hearing about it. Like please stop I don’t wanna think about big mouth as much as you freaks apparently do. Blaming it for every show cancellation and using it in away to get a  weird sense of moral superiority against idk Nick kroll I guess?
Well, somebody was 10 minutes late!
YES! I'm tired of Netflix cancelling all of their best shows so they can put more money into making animated child porn!
Cartoon Mark is lookin' super clean this year.
Better than Velma
I hatethissssss l am in painnnnnnnnn
"Is Big Mouth REALLY That Bad?" I'm gonna save you 56 minutes, yes it is.
I Like the new style
150th coment
yes!
Yay yippie I love lsmark
Yes, and also yes, I watched all 56 minutes in 2 minutes. I'm a timelord
hey buckaroo
It depends on your teste I tried a demo for a game that everyone is throwing tomatoes at but i honestly had fun with the demo for the ps5 Also bonus points for reminding me of those consle displays like toys r us!
They cancelled inside job and final space which is insane. Two great shows but they let shows like paradise pd and big mouth is given so much.
New character style? (I love it)
I liked the old mark more he was so cute
Yes
No offense but i dont really like the new design you use in your videos i think the old designs are better.
54:27 bruh they’re literally twins
I’m convinced it was made by pedos
Thank you Mark. I'm sorry I was impatient
Yes
Yes yes it is....I cry everytime I remember I used to live on a pre big mouth world.
Big Mouth is one of those shows that since it's not on live television, it can do whatever it wants as long as Netflix is ok with it. The show's humour is very vulgar but they manage to do it in a very very hilariously wrong way and that's what I love about these types of shows.
Bro LS Mark needs to make a F is For Family video I'd love to see him talk about a show as amazing and complex as it
This new format is epic
It's cringe at times but it actually gets laughs out of me unlike some of these other adult shows. Now I've only seen the forest 3 seasons so it may have gotten worse since then but it always seemed fairly self aware even during the uncomfortable bits.
Hey mark you should check out scissor seven its got a goofy art style and decent story a few episodes in
First
A
yeah it is really that bad
I mean........it was created by nick kroll what do you expect
One thing I’m honestly upset about is the fact they canceled inside job witch left on a cliff hanger just so we can get more horrible seasons and spin offs of the atrocity known as big mouth
Yes
Netflix: We hate animation I want to get rid of it. Me: ONE OF YOUR BIGGEST SHOWS IS AN ANIMATED ONE!!!!!! (Also I like your new rebrand)
Love the redesign!
yes
Love the new art style. It’s really good
Here before ranking every big mouth episode
was just checking the community post like "mark it's been an hour where's the video 😒"
It’s quite the big mouth!
Yes it is I'm sorry (not). I really like your new character portraits btw!   Soup was here.
nice hands mark
Velma is better than Big Mouth. Not by much, but it is.
I love the new artstyle
Dam new design
I like the new art you have there
All the new stuff is clean great job mark
You have a new look
Man Inside Out was just gettin good Netflix a whole ass hoe n a half
NEW DESIGN
Mark your new style is cool 👏
Not first
Big mouth is a “show” not a good one but a show
thanks for uploading on the day of my homecoming dance
It is
LOVE THE NEW LOOKS!
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FACE!
56 MINUTES
oh god marks evolving!
Mark are you going to do every fairly odd parents episode?
Finally
Long story short: Yes
Oh yeah RTX Mark is now here
Bro I love the new pfp update it looks sick ✨✨✨👏👏
Love the new style it looks so good 👍
