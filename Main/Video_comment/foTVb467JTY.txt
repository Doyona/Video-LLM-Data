This why Lewis whooped him                              Still here?             Nah just kidding
My heart always went to this man. Right from the start of his career, I just saw ppl pulling every part of him. I followed him pretty close, and I could be wrong but I believe he was misguided & taken advantage of so wrongly by those around him. Yeah ppl can say ‘duh no shit’ but he got bad raps which lead to bad choices. I don’t condone his infamous ring moves, but I’d still pay THOUSANDS to see him fight.
Bro pushed the ref
Dude serious wanted to win the fight after getting socker punched😂😂😂😂
Should have been disqualified.  When the ref says stop you stop. Lives are at risk.
Ref  , Mike it's over  Mike Tyson. Ref get out off my way motherfucker
Thatd be zoned in...not zoned out
Tyson was just a straight nut back then
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tysons black managers had niggerfied him.
Tyson was definitely coked up in this fight, he was saying some wild shit in the post fight interview.
Se paso de revoluciones
Tyson we love 💕💕 when you would beat the dodo out of the dummies.
Cus saw a champion in him..
COCAINE IS A HELL OF A DRUG
Pero me gustó cdo Hollyfiield tiró a la lona a Tyson
Рефери просто мешал!  Тайсон чувствовал несправедливость судейства!
Mike ain't zoned-out.  He's *zoned-in*
“I loth conthrol”
Ref : it's over  Mike: it's not over until I kill His corner: you killed him Mike.
TF DID THAT MAN DO TO HIM
He was still punching Tyson
Tyson is THE man!!!!!
Scary
There will NEVER be another one like him. Lightning speed, blowing power, insane defense, and that hell rage... He just had it all.
I rooted for Tyson in almost all of his fights.  Especially against Holyfield and the cunning coward, Lennox Lewis.  As much as I admire Iron Mike.  he was a dirty boxer.
Wow at the end u can see mike he is genuinely confused on why they stopped it too look at his facial expression
Cheque drops.
Lou Savarese has my respect
He was litteraly coked up
Last man standing including the ref.
Gotta keep that knockout count high 🤘
Now that's what you call scary , a zoned out Tyson with you in the ring!
Tyson would be able to commit murder easily.
Another jake Paul's boyfriend get down and Jake thinks he can take tyson down because he has power jaja jaja
That sound effect.
“The baddest man” “Come inside the ring” Sorry I’ll leave now.
Beast mode!!
Just wanna be clear-             *"What did this guy exactly do to mike?"*
Just coked out
Ali was a "Bad Man" in the ring. Tyson, a bad man with a "stoic smile"🤨👈 and a sinister opaque glare in his eyes 👀 👽👈 Ya' think he's mechanized, too?...Never U mind....
Show offffffff
And django was born.
That's just how he was the dude popped back up and said something and looked like he shock it off so he was beating him until there was no more way he could hurt him I have alpt. Of respect for Mike I always have but since he has gotten older he has gained more respect  but Is still the  baddest man on the planet..
The dude got hit so hard that he was out on his feet still punching back Legit dude was no longer in control of his body
The ref deserves props for throwing himself in front of Tyson's punches like that.
"Cus died before he could teach me how to turn it off, how to control it to live with it." -Mike Tyson
"If he is still standing, my punches are still landing" Tyson.
Ref think to dq tyson... nah, i let it slide this time...
He was so zoned in not zoned out.
Not zoned out yet ZEROED IN warriors war that our nature.much respect Sir I salute
Tyson is good boxer
He was there to fight. Wasnt playing around. From the words of Denzel " take your hands off me"!
Mike bite someone’s ear 😒😑
i know why mike did this ,that savarese is italian he pobably called him a nikker
Tyson really wanted to hospitalise the guy, but was stopped by his cornerman. He said FUCK IT and punched the referee, his cornerman and his opponent into the nearest hospital and ate a bagel 💀
Don’t fuck wit my boy Tyson he will beat you till he sees fit !!! Like a beast will 💪
Tyson was like why did u kill my teacher? in his Bruce Lee voice,. lol
Like stated in a interview “I didn’t hear the Reff, I was fighting and I couldn’t hear anybody till I seen the reff on the boxer and my corner man coming in”
I love Tyson,
a little dummy dust goes along way🤪🤩😈🙈🙉🙊👊👊👊
that dude was big asf he just hug Mike until he tired 😂
Lmfaoooo Mike was a whole savage.
He knew what he was doing bad sportsmanship which one of y'all gonna say that
Wasitnya yang tidak profesional menghentikan mike Tyson tanpa pelanggaran
Very unprofessional
Tyson: "Rip and tear until iths done"
Cocaine is a hell of a drug
😱🤣😆💪💪👏
COCAINE
Mike said back then he seriously didn't want his opponents to get back up so his goal was to kill them.
How about if, when Mike Tyson    DIDNT ? 😁🥺
i feel sorry for the man
Cants stop me now
Chino Maidana with Floyd, hammering the fk outta Floyd's head and Floyd still beat him with jabs professionally
That was an Unprofessional Act
That left punch took me out along with the sound effect 🤣
All Tyson fights staged. Sorry to inform.
I can see Charlie Chaplin in the opponent 😂
I love Mike Tyson but the only real names he fought he lost to
Next to Ray Mercer beating the brakes off of Tommy Morrison, this is one of the worst AW’s of all time 😂😂😂 Look like Tyson knocked him out then hit him again and woke him up 😂😂😂 honorable mention to Ike Ibeabuchi literally beating Chris bird silly 😂
Lou was the biggest fraud in boxing
Well the other was still punching at the end so...
I remember a fight I got into against a bully in gr 7 when i blacked out of my mind while I was on top of him and punching the bigger boy under me while screaming 'you think you can beat me up?!' but after the fight, my buddy told me that I wasn't even hitting him on the ground but I was punching the asphalt instead lol. That explained my bloody knuckles lol
These days, I think Mike is just pretending that he's nothing but a harmless old man 🤣🤣🤣🤣.
😱😱😱
That was about color
Tyson beast
😮😮😯😯😯😬😬😬
Looking like a predator, in killer mode
The adrenaline was running like a river!
Tyson was a loose cannon if cus d'amato had lived . mike would have eventually attacked the old man !
You see no guns! Win or lose they both live to fight another day.
Mike is on go....😂😂
bloodrush
One time while practicing karate I zoned out n wound up hitting a spectator by accident
I think Tysons fights were fixed. alot of money.
That white boy big for nothing.
My man was so bored of the fight, his consciousness was probably sleeping
When an animal fights humans.
What I Take From This Is Don't Piss Tyson Off Period
Adrenaline
*zoned in
He disrespected him. Got to be something behind that like heard him calling racial slur in his back or his face
When your committed to winning this is what you do ,he wasn't gonna stop until he was out
Tyson ain’t a fighter. He’s a stone cold killer.
Greatest boxer ever. If you’ve seen his recent training videos he’s still got it. #Mike Tyson v Tyson Fury. I personally think Mike would fold him in the first round
Should been disqualified.....this just proves even more how rigged boxing became....Tyson wasn't supposed to lose....so disqualification would have done just that....alot of money from rich people lost....get it?
"If he doesn't die, it doesn't count." -Mike Tyson
Mighty Mike ,crazier than a fish.🙄🙄lol love mike but I do feel bad for this older referee.
Yooo
If refree had by chance got one smack on his head, then Tyson would have lost an already won fight 😂
badass tyson
My dad knew Gus My dad grew up in a war in Sicily that’s why I am like Mike Tyson we can’t control it
Guys a convicted for rape why you idolized a convicted rapist..
He was on cocain during this fight
It should’ve been a draw Saverys lost but Tyson having his people come in the ring should’ve been disqualified
zoned out ? smh
More like zoned “in” 😅
Savarese, to his credit, took a beating and walked away. Not many did.
That punch sound effect had me dying
Because he was an animal.
You miss said "coked out".
Mike always go crazier whenever he fights white guys!
None of his fight should count he was high in every match
Off hiz cap
Tyson literally explained after the interview he didnt hear the bell, if you watch the full video you'll see him immediately apologize, it's okay I dont expect casuals to know this
If any other boxer did that you would all be against it 🤨
The referee owned Penn Sports shop in Wolverhampton, England 🇬🇧
He should get red carded for this. 😂
Pitbull with blood in the fight...
The baddest man mike tyson...dude deserves mad respect
This man was trying to kill his opps with punches
Did this guy talk a lot of smack before the fight?
It's crazy cuz if we're paying it to see this we actually have to give the man some compassion after all that he's been through in and out of prison still going into the ring yet sometimes held against him.
Mike would’ve killed him if the ref wouldn’t have stopped it
Mike tyson was also known to do cocaine before fights.. is this why he was so zoned out?
Hey Mike why did you ignore the ref here?  Mike:  "I don't recall, but i would beat the fk outta floyd"  lmao
i thought he would never lose a fight...bummer
He needed to hear the "kill switch" password from his MK Ultra handler but Mike couldn't hear it until the handler was close enough.
He was on drugs
😂😂😂😂🍺🍺🍺
Tyson fighting another nobody ...
He reminded me of a pit bull. No matter how tall,short,buff,skinny or fat. If you seen a pit bull loose roaming the neighborhood.Its In the house or on top of a car you go. Or risk getting your ass handed to you.
White boy look like he talk so much shit
Mike has grown so much he's in a better place mentally now that he doesn't have all the vultures around him.
What a complete joke of a fight. Mike fought a LOT of tomato cans
Stop... For the love of god he's already dead
Bruh, refs need a helmet
Fake
Lou savarese the man who KO'ed Buster Douglas in the first round.
He was hypnotized, not zonked out.
Thats sad for the other fighter ngl
Just imagine what he could've done with a normal mind.
Cocaine is a hell of a Drug
"Zoned out"😅🤣😂 U mean focused. Totally  opposite definitions...
dang! Mike didn't give a daYum
So he should have got a dq
Um the footage is here idk if thats true haha
actually I think the referee and the boxer that was shaking and he knocked down. I think they should both sue them for all his money. take everything away from that. he goes back to the ghetto belongs go back to the ghetto where you belong. go back to the getaway you belong. go back to the f****** getaway you belong. go join your old gang member. sell drugs. do whatever you need to do. go back to the ghetto go back to your gang. your old gang without actually breaking your arm but go back to your old gang members
you know all these videos what shows me. The boxing committee actually dropped the ball they keep letting him fight. he fights 30. he does stuff. he just- points off of it. you just keep letting him go and go and go and go and go. Yes he belongs in straight jacket. Yes he belongs in the looney bin. Yes, he needs to take anger management classes. he belongs in prison actually prison prison, prison prison but you guys just ignored. it ignored it All those poor people that were injured and bitten in ear bitten off. and by the way, I didn't see the ear getting spit out. did he actually eat it? they actually swallow it all. this stuff could have been avoided if the boxing committee would have actually done their job. where were you guys at? what were you guys doing watching housewives? were you watching soap operas? what were you guys doing needing a sweater? you guys are the epitome of the Earth letting this crap go on and on and on and on and on and you just kept letting it go. He's a looney been f****** he belongs in the f****** loony bin. he belongs to straitjack. he belongs in prison
Майк))) лучший
WTF Ivan Drago Jeez
Did that ref pee himself? Cause I would've 😂😂😂
I wish to hell the press would stop praising a foul mouth, threatening Tyson. Has no respect for any one, child and women.
Give the guy props for flopping around like a human punching bag after getting knocked partially out
You should have said something to his brother...
Tyson "huh you're stopping the fight? I was just warming up, c'mon man "
Its so sad how Tysons opponent was still trying to punch him after Tyson stopped
Maybe his trashtalk
I know Lou, he’s a good humble guy who does a lot for people and he’s still in shape and training people here in Houston.  #mafiaTies
Koooooocaineeeeee
That man never fought again
Zoned out means dude was high as fuck on coke
Tyson had that Bezerker rage
Tyson is not a neat fighter.
They used to take Mike off his meds before the fights so he would be pure aggression. He wasn't zoned out...HE WAS COMPLETELY CRAZY!
Cocaine is one hella of drug
Imagine undergoing an intense training just you knockout your opponent in 1 round, that's not worth your training
He truly should had be disqualified and fined for that behavior. Some will pretend it was okay but at not point should a fighter blatantly disregard the referee.
Mike was vicious and competitive but he was never an asshole.. especially not in the ring.. let's not talk about Holyfield.. even that it's just cuz he was afraid of losing.. something must have happened here to set him off
The ref is a courageous man
Tyson floors Ref and Opponent.
The ref is laughing 😅
LA RAGE DE VAINCRE AU NOM DE RÉUSSIR SON TRAVAIL.
Bi
The beast mode Mike Tyson doesn't like.. shame Cus weren't around to show him to switch that mode off..
Savaresi must have prayed HARD to all the Gods. Allah, Buddha, Zeus, Odin, Yaweh, Isis etc etc.  Because he doesn't realize he came close to meeting anyone of them god's.
Another bum in Tyson's record..not many A level because he dodged most of them and the ones he faced KO'D his ass...
Tyson was and is my favorite Fighter of all time. And the Man he has become is still a man to look up too.
Tyson is like a fool Bull 😂😂😂
"zoned out" Tyson. 😂 You mean "young, attempted murderer" Tyson? 🤣
This guy was the monster.
Mike Tyson is too stupid
They even did the sound effect 🤣🤣🤣
Did they say Tyson zoned out?? IMO, he Zoned in 💀
Made mistake by shaking his head...
"I juth wanna sthpar"
Cocaine is a hell off a drug
I'd say he's pretty zoned in, not out
If you know he was high on Coke.. like 😉
I like the little slaps his opponent threw to his side at the end
I hate the sound of your voice you suck
That ref is a lot like a rodeo clown throwing himself in front of a bull in an effort to save a cowboy who’s in trouble!
That ref has balls.
Killer instinct 💯literally
People before me were very fortunate to witness the legend in his prime… my ass got stuck with Floyd
If it boils down to putting myself between Tyson in a rage or the other dude dying - someone call the other dude's family and break it to them gently.
Terminate mode engaged
Tyson should have been DQ’d at that fight
Is that why he went to jail?
mike dont like White boys....👍👍👍👍
Wow. Tyson fans r so bias. This is a plumber he's fighting. All while ducking Evander and Lennox! 💯 You saw what real great boxers do when facing Mike. Two ko's. Would've been 3rd but Mike, losing resorted to biting!!! 😂😂
High on cocainaaaaaa bro hahaha
Young tyson was a real POS
Ref playin wit his life
The greatest heavyweight champ
He zoned out.. But his punches aren't..
"Put im in a straight jacket. "
Everyone talking about Mike and Referee.  Me thinking: why Lou Savarese chose to be a boxer.
wish he did this vs douglas he cant 😭
Ref was happy af 😂
He wasn't zoned out, instead of Lou he saw his mama telling him that women are the devil
Mike was gonna make sure he stayed down the second time.
Nah them mushrooms lol
Mike tyson the type to knock you out wake you up then knock you out again 😂😂
That’s not zoned out. That’s ZONED IN!
Why was Savarese ever in a ring with Tyson? Just suicidal.
In tysons words if his not dead it doesn’t count
Ref put himself in front of punches that could sink a battleship
Zoned out? Or did you mean high?
Fake Henry Cavill almost got screwed
Wth is wrong with him
I must emphasize that this was only the 1st Round lol
Zoned out he was to zoned in 🤣😂
Lol
ANDREW TATE HIT HIS MOM https://youtu.be/p7MugD-jwao
This was back in Mike's darkest time. He really was in a bad place at this time. I'm really glad to see he's found inner peace. Would love to meet him. Not even pick his brain just about his boxing career but just sit down with him and talk. Garuntee he has some amazing stories about his life outside of boxing
The engine just revved up, cant stop it instantly yo
Play until the whistle is blown…
Coked up and drunk af
ROFL 😂😂😂😂 so funny 😂😂😂
The King Of The Barbarians
The definition of blind rage. This man is responsible for introducing the world to a new level of violence, and we owe him the greatest debt of gratitude possible for it.
Why do people love that mile tyson?
Mike Tyson was 34 during this, it was when he was less of an animal and being more like his older self which he is now
Straight up legend, thee best ever 💯💪🏾🔥🥊
Why wasn't Mike fined? That's non señse.
"Zoned out"? Uhhh *coked up*
I mean i guess this can be summed in one quote “If you aint dying it aint working”
My cousin Mugalu also a violent convicted burglar and rapist is hated while Mike is respected? Mugalu will star in new Hollywood movie "Slapping Chris" where he plays a big man that beats a small man for making jokes about his wife. It will win Oscar.
I heard in his book Tyson was on crack during this fight
Screaming MIIIKE MIIIKE MIIIIIIKEEEEE MIIIKEEE
Some say Tyson knocked out ten people before cooling down 🤣🤣🤣
Mike Tyson wasn’t zoned out or angry he was scared before most of his fights. An angry man is scary, a fearful man is dangerous.
Hell I'm white I know Tyson said I'm going to kill this big Russian white malfo
Mike tyson its like a pitbull he wouldn't stop biting you until when he's owner told him to stop
We’ll I remember him saying he was trying to kill everyone he fought.
It's called bad sportsmanship .
😳 idgaf this is motivation for me
This is a DQ.
I can just imagine the combination between 2Pac and Mike Tyson? Explosive!
Iron Tyson ❤🔥🔥
Your rich why does it matter. You shud treat all people equal
Does he not realize most of his fans were white. The money since the population of black is only 12% of america. So 80% o your fans were white. May e they shud realize you don't like white men.
Mike is an amazing fighter. It's funny how every fight against a white guy he faught w pure anger he try to kill them he punished all white boxers for being white.
Lou punches Tyson while the referee was literally trying his hardest to get in between a basic combo that’s working too well. When Tyson notices the referee he begins backing off until that illegal punch from Lou. Lou wanted to make Tyson look bad and paid for it.
“With Great power comes gre…". Well you know the thing
He kept throwing punches, so that means he was 'ZONED IN' not out bro
I think you meant ZONED THE FUCK IN‼️😤
Ivander holy field taught him how to fight
Tyson is not a boxer he is a street fighter
"They're jumping.. they out here jumping me!"     -Kevin Hart
Man's focus is incredible
Tyson DID NOTHING WRONG! THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN DISRESPECTFUL, DISGUSTING, DISPARAGING GARBAGE!
You know how fucking terrifying that must be when you’re getting hammered by Mike Tyson and the referee comes in and Mike Tyson’s just still swinging at you
He was in the ZONE!!
This is so fake. All his videos are fake. Look close. It's all camera tricks. You can't believe everything you see on youtube.  Smh
He is high on cocain
It was a huge event in the UK in Glasgow. Mike was at the tail end of his career & had never fought in the UK but always wanted to.  There lots of 2nd/3rd generation Italians in Glasgow so King thought it would be good to put this Bum in front of Mike. Hence Mike’s frustration after 26 seconds
Bro said Chickens were better than Pigeons
Lou died but stood up and kept fighting! What a man...
Imagine a second coming of Mike Tyson in the form of another fighter
Wow
Did you see Mike Tyson’s face 😮he was truly an animal
The baddest man
Mad man 🔥
draconic
I love you Mike Tyson 💜🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
So if Tyson's Corner Man came in the Ring to stop the bout, means Tyson should be disqualified!
That makes me 🐝in lot of pain.. I don't like hurting anyone
wasn’t he coked out in this fight
Bro got slavery out on that guy
People get it wrong in this fight there both fighting ref stopped it and both liked at each confused why it was stopped ref didn’t shout or hear a bell so it natural to carry on
Idk why everyone likes this guy, he is a maniac
What does it matter Tyson's opponent was going to lose anyway 🥊
why did he do that? what did the guy do to piss him off?
That's glass joe
This fight was crazy the guy stood no chance. Baddest man alive
Tyson really said “get out the way homie” 😂😂
I imagine him like a dog “let me at them”
It was said Mike didn't get his McDonald's that night, thats why he's so mad.
The funniest thing once Tyson saw his corner men he didn't even realise that sabawhatever hit 👊  him😂 the ref deserves a purp heart😂
Wth!!!
Ref: you know son I got punched by a goat boxer
When your partner ended too early but you are in a hype.
Now he is a calm and reasonable person 😂😂
Tyson would smoke weed before his fight to zone out 😂 Now don't get in the away of him on the munchies. Tyson thought he was fighting a All you can eat buffet 😂 CV
"doom movie auditions are now open! wait, who is the first candidate?! MIKE TYSON?!"
He beat the shit outta him🤣🤣🤣
Tyson was so aggressive in this because his opponent was a white guy. White rules over black in USA
Ref knew what was gonna happen when his opponent was defenseless
He wasnt zoned out hes getting old bow days, 100% hes taken a punch and hes body didbt handle as it use to and it made him push harder than he was but the fight was already ib the midst if being called a tko
Zoned out? Nah, he was zoned tf IN.
That is the bravest man in world to try and stop tyson
one of the worst haircuts Tyson got 😂
Bro was still swinging AND standing..... Tyson ain't wrong !
Hulk…No Smash…??
Lmao just thinking  if it was me in that ring and how fast I would be talking to my lord and savior Jesus Christ 🤣
let him get up, let him get up
This is the downfall of youtube
That's when big Mike was not in his right mind
This is supposed to be a professional boxer?  He's a joke
I would never let anyone push me
It looks like he just turned on auto grind mode
🥶🥶🥶
If I can’t hear him he’s not there-Mike Tyson to the ref 2000
Thanks to the refree save his life.
The guy was still holding him and trying to punch him.
zoned in...not out
It's a little bit fk off title hit him until he goes down he Cleary wasn't aware
hes like Bruce Banner, calm collective person. But if you anger him a lil bit hes the big green monster you literally cant stop
Anytime I read or even think of a mike Tyson quote, I hear/read it in his voice and two make it 2x worse For some reason I feel the emotion but maybe bcuz Of the times I’ve seen him express himself he’s very emotional
Tyson was a freak of a fighter, no doubt. But he was also a thug. People forget that.
Tyson: This dude ain't falling. Guess I'll just knockout the ref
Dude probably was thinking like yoooo tf are you doing, man? It's not that serious 🤣
Tyson mode. Full tunnel vision if you're still standing.
Yujiro: atta boy 😈😈
People in here don’t know shit he was coked out of his mind.
Zoned out my ass!! He said himself if he wasn’t down he wasn’t happy he wasn’t  zoned out he was use to knockouts so he wanted a knockout!
Mike was like: why you screaming at me? 😂
If he’s standing it’s game on!!!
😁 yes sir
Focus
"If he ain't dead, it don't count"
Shout out to all of the Black Athletes who make *irrelevant* pages relevant without any true thanks.  So Zoned Out 🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥
Mike Tyson said because I bet 200 Grand on 50 seconds
Holy I got scared for everyone in that room for a moment 😭🤞
That sound effect... PSHT lol.
Mike was like “if he ain’t dead, the fights not over” Jesus Christ
Coke
God loves yall and Jesus Christ is returning soon and repent’.
I would be afraid if i was the ref
Like a pittbul
Zoned out .he's was just unprofessional asshole .
He was on shrooms
The spirit of Dempsey went into him
The drugs were in there at this point
Complete pos
He should have been banned from fighting for life for that
That’s why Mike was talking about how he was scared of himself for his opponent before a fight
He was high on drugs.
Im head butting the shit out of Mike for that. Don’t care. Forhead to the nose full force
Like a Bull.  He saw red
GOOD MILE A MAN AFTER MINE OWN HEART ONCE HE STARTS HE WONT STOP UNTIL HE LEAVES EM LYING ! INSULT HIM WITH EVEN ENTERING THE RING THE FOOL GOT WHAT HD DESERVED LIKE MIKE A LOT HE CONDITIONS  MY HEART TO DEAL WITH THE MAGGOTS THE FILTH AND THE PROBLEMS RIGHT THIS TIME. SHOOT TA KILL. !!!!
I know this zoned out feeling when in  a scrap, all too familiar
Oh how I wish this was jake paul..
That's scary XD
He dissociated.
Yeah this isn't the year 2000 so I don't know where you got your information
Mikes never seen an opponent get up 🐯
Like a trance. A killers trance  Fuck that
I remember this. Mike was angry because the kid named Dary Hommo Brown (short for Homicide).  had just got bodied in Brooklyn. That dude was a rough house and ran hard with Mike back in the days.  So Mike wanted to hurt something and Lou Savarese was the unlucky candidate.
The slap sound effect 😂😂😂😂 is priceless.
That dudes face! He is scared outta his mind.
Monster
Straight up left punch through his glove concussed him, now that’s power 🤯
REF GETS PUSHED DOWN. EVERYONE GOING DOWN !!! HAHAHAHA   DUNAMAS
STOOD UP AGAIN SHAKING GOING ON !!! HAHSJHAHSHA
A. MAN AFTER. MINE OWN HEART HE IS ME !!! YESHUAHHARMASHIACH SWEET. WEED !!! MARY JANE
Mike Tyson is every indian mom when you get a B+ instead of an A+
You are a bad man lol
Mike said in a interview years later he was actually trying to swat a fly that was attracted to the sweat.
...if you fight a Alfa....you may need to escape
prime tyson was terrifying
Like a pit bull I love it! Mike Tyson is king! GOAT live Mike Tyson!
Thats the demon hes always talking about. The one he couldnt turn off after the fight was over.
He was high on cocaine for his fights
The only man who immigrated a lion
He's just crying a moment ago
Reason why Floyd is just useless and pathetic
I thought tyson was kind of crazy, but now  i am sure of it.!
Bro it’s so scary fighting that Beast lol Hahahahaha
He prolly called mike Tyson a nigga
‘In his own zone’  The excuses people make for certain people are pathetic
Great true story,book title-"Cowboy Mafia".-"
"I WANT TO EAT YOUR CHILDREN. PRAISE BE TO ALA!"
If he can crawl, he can brawl
You don't sound too intelligent mispronouncing Lou Savarese's name
Mike tyson is a rapist
As a old boxer you can go there quick.
Y’all know that eye of the tiger song? Most of u think of rocky…I think of Tyson
Peace and Christ Bless you all! Have a nice day everyone! [09-07-2022_01_34.]
He is a Warrior
Play dead fool
Zoned out you mean coked out LOL but I'm glad he's back in the public eye in a positive way
That referee deserves a really good retirement bonus, getting to stop Mike at that time was no joke
Mike Tyson In his prime would knock out Ali….you can’t change my mind
Legendary Mike Tyson knockout its opponent and 26 seconds #IronMike
Shame on that other man for pretending he was still boxing
Punches in bunches!
Tyson be like: The gloves were stiil on his hand, Ref....🤭
*guy holding on for dear life*:  "Hey mike im waving the white flag for god sake let me give up in peace already"
Dempsey would be proud
He was on his Brooklyn bull$hit 🤣😂🤣😂
He never lost control he was in control the whole time in the zone
What I wish people did when teachers stop a fight in school
Cus and his hypnosis sessions really turner mike into a beast
Tyson was a bad man! 👎
I love mike, for the beast he was and even more for the wise and humble man he is today. In his prime he gave inspiration to those that wanted to be great and now he gives hope, humility and compassion to those that want to improve. I love this man and what he stands for, he’s a hero in so many ways throughout his life
Referee - The match is Over Tyson - Yes
That's why he is also called BULL DOG TYSON. Bulldogs latch on and they zone out.. Purest form of organic fighting instincts..and then u train him.. lethal combination..
Richard Sa,  explained the situation perfectly I'd say
Everyone has a plan until you punch him on the face
Mad respect after so many punches by iron mike the guy was still trying
This is what I want to do to my league of legends teammates :p
"the baddest man " ????? Are you serious ??
Like a 'pitbull ' whoa
Zoned out? More like he was too much in the zone :/
You have to give it to Lou,  he got rocked so hard he probably thought it was the next round. He even threw a few soft punches. At the end.
This man was more ferocious than a Tasmanian devil.
That tall dude was finished in that round
I'm ngl, that is absolutely disgusting. I'd have disqualified him. This is exactly how you turn someone into what Ali has become.
He was also off his nut on cocaine in this fight
he is the hardest punch out boss
What do you expect when you put a lamb in the ring with a lion
I love how people say this guy is a goat. No, boxing is about discipline and Tyson never had any.
Двое  в драку, третий в сраку🙃
They should have banned that fucking nutter Tyson!
That f up
The look on Tyson’s face shows he blacked out, had the 😧 face
Tyson's a God
I Never Saw Someone Get Put To Sleep 💤  & Get Woke Up 😵🥴😳 All At The Same Time WOW!!!
Baddest man isn’t fair to call him that
Once he zoned out and raped a woman too
Savarese had a very big mouth and Mike Tyson closed it exceptionally.
Mike is WAR!!!
He's not defenceless if he's still swinging stop making stuff up
Why wasn't Tyson disqualified
Tyson was so much better than his opponents that they have 2 had at least 3 refergeres 2 stop the champ from killing them.
Zoned out makes it seem like he was high.
The realization that if this man was coming at me I wouldn’t know what to do?  Punch him? I would brake my hand on his yaw. Block? No fucking chance. Try to dodge? The only reason you can see his punches is because they arnt for you. Even as old mike Tyson I probably couldn’t outrun him either. What a beast.
Sheesh!! LOL!! IT'S like Mike wasn't even in control of his actions in that moment. It was like a demon flew into his body at the bell and took over. Lmao!!!
This gotta be the only Tyson fight I've never seen!!!!!
I sense bloodlust on him.
When savage beastmode is activated.  FINISH HIM!!!
Tyson had snapped😂😂😂
Tyson is such a bad ass just one of a kind. Let's cherish him why we still have a living legend
IRON MIKE TYSON
Ganaaas.😀
never forget, he is just a rapist!
This is called hypnosis or being hypnotized
Epic Mike was not the one to be play with 🤣  I love his spiritual transformation 🙏🏾
Mike doesn't like quitters!
That was a gazelle punch btw, not a single left hook
Tyson is the Goat . For making dumb of himself . His a families disgrace 😝
Zoned in not out
I didn't bite half his ear off yet ref? Which white guy am I fighting?🤕🤨😥
What an animal.
Steroids rage
that punch sound effect makes it so much better
Beast mode!
Jesus fucking Christ, that first punch that landed looked way too fast, even with the footage slowed down. Mike was a damn beast.
Absolute animal 😂 I love Mike Tyson
MK -Ultra mind control had Mike
The ref deserves all the praise He threw himself in to try to make sure it was safe Brave man to stand in between Tyson's punches and its targets
"Tyson landed a bunch of punches on his face" -worst commentator ever
Literally adhd in a nutshell
That is Mike's job
He was punishing that idiot for being arrogant before the fight
That wasn’t a fight it was a hate crime .
😂😂😂😂 zoned out 😂😂😂
idiot tyson..he follow no rules nothing..just hitting like a angry mad man
Well yeah. Everyone's mindset is different.
The fight lasted 26 seconds. Gosh, this video is longer than the whole fight
Tyson blocked that last punch without even looking. Defense on god mode
He was an animal in the ring fk the reffere lol
But but....  It's competition. They are not savage animals ..... Fighting is not that bad... Shitty sport
Theres gotta be a guy that can whoop mike tyson right? 😂
The ref must have been shitting bricks trying to get in between them
Shit happens we move on still the baddest man to ever live
Biggest baddest dirty fighter on the planet
Pitbull
That’s is not 2000…. He doesn’t even have a tat. And he’s got a full head of hair.
Ref chose death
NOBODY hit harder than Tyson I don't care only power I can compare to Tysons is George foreman or deontay Wilder
Peoples champ
I wish I can fight like Mike Tyson that man has super power and I wish I can get that type of power and speed
Damn they didn’t show how compassionate Tyson was when they stopped the fight. He held his opponent at arms length and consoled him.
Mike was bad 🤣🤣🤣
Didn’t look over to me tbh
He doesn’t fight for money he fights to kil😂
Dude is like a pit bull he doesn’t stop
😂😂I love MIKE
Muhammad Ali: *Calls ref to end match because his opponent can’t fight*  This iron mf:
IRON MIKE TYSON
Zoned in
Tyson straight savage
Tyson is a black S O B.
Mike wanted his soul
It is what it could be on both sides stand bys
Yo the refs eyes was popping out his head 😭 with that look like PLS STOPPP! Tyson melted right out that fight mode from savage to wait a minute why you yellin at me 🤔🤣
This didn’t happen in 2000 wtf 😂
Like a fuckin pitbull. Once he starts he can't stop
That's just the killer instinct kicked in and can't snap out
🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Mike on coke
Ref: "It's over!!!" Mike: "its over when he's dead" Mikes corner: "HE'S DEAD MIKE!!! HE'S DEAD!!!"
I honestly think post incarceration with the toll of the drug use he lost himself. He legit looked kind of confused when heis cornerman jumped in. Some guys lost go blind with rage in a fight. Mike definately looked like he fell into that.
When atheletes gets in the zone, that moment is so special
Jejejejejejejejejejejejejejejejejejejejejejejejejejejejeejejejejejejejejejeeeeeeee
What you should also mention is that Mike was coked out like a mf during this fight
Auhtor
Talk about a sucker for punishment
“Besth mode engaged”
Wild animal
You can't stop a pit bull in the middle of a fight
His corner man had to do what now?
It almost feels like the guy was quitting and Tyson was pissed
Y2k
Wasn’t he coked out
He is not bowing down, he still got energy. Let me suck it up
He admitted he was high on coke at the time
this has happened to me alot of times i zone out and forget what im doing for like 20 sec
*Zoned in
Rip
tyson was and is nothing more than a thug. should have been banned for life, especially after the whole ear thing
Yep... Tyson and cocaine are scary shit
Hell yeah Mike.
Best Ref I've ever, have balls so big he protected that dude even he gets taken down
Mike tyson already zone out at round 1... damn
Who’s here after Tyson landed punches on the airline passenger?
I know lou sarvase and the gym he went to crazy part is I wonder why Tyson was pissed.
Lou Tavarese????? Come on Tyson
For real that was the Bad Side of His Career and it wasn't good
Yeah. Lennox Lewis rekt Tyson
Tyson is not just a bad man he's a good man idk him personally I'm way too poor to visit any childhood heros lol but this man is human and he his a bad ass fighter and everything no one but Ali can be compared to this man
Tyson made his mark!!! 🐐👏🏼🙅🏽‍♀️💜💯👊🏼🎉👏🏼
My knee is literally broke 😭😭😭
I had a dog like that just lost it .
Savarese sneaking two punches at the end 😂😂
And its a surprise why they have locked up approximately half this race of scary BM.
Dude wtf you are on my fy 3. time in a row now
Hm, but now he looks like an old man who aged so prematurely.
Balrog
He came inside the ring?!?!?
He like a lion in the ring
First Round hahahahaha
He was on major stimulants..
Red LIKE STOP MF U DRAWWIN🤣🤣🤣
He probably snorted a few lines before the fight
He was the best boxer but not the best human being or athlete.
Zoned in*
TYSON COULD'VE EASILY KILLED SOMEBODY,IF HE WANTED TO....
TYSON WAS LIKE A MAD PITBULL,JUST SAVAGE😵😖😡
Never u will see a better fighter than tyson . He knock every todays fighter easy including mayweather . 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Lucky enough to witness this fight in Scotland at Glasgow rangers ground Hamdon park
This reminds me of that scene in rocky when drago pushed the ref n killed creed
That’s because Tyson was hungry for another 👂
I must break you - tyson
No self controle so bad !! No respect as a fighter
F TYSON
Focused man
That's what happens sometimes in any physical sport. Sometimes the fighters blanks out, it's like auto pilot fight mode.
He malfunctioned 😂😂😂
Tyson ain't ty son no more after cus
When he stood up again shaking 😭😭😭👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾😅
"Oh what hathened?
He was like a very, very determined rhinoceros back then. Fight him if you want your head disconnected.
Why Tyson didn't do that to Holyfield?
In 2000 Tysoe wasn't the baddest
Mike was on too much cocaine
Must of been on some good sniff
“Zoned out” lol cope. He knew what he was doing.
I always wondered what it would be like to have Mike Tyson and Muhammad Ali in his prime fight
Zoned IN bro lol On target focus.
He wasn't zoned out, just mean.
Mike a crazy mthrfkr but wise af now in old age bc of it
in my country,when mike's fight,it looks like national holiday😂
Tyson was too aggressive
Look at the size of that white dude! You really think Mike is scared of anyone? Hell no Steve Cold panties Osteinhermaster or whatever  Mike woulda murder Steve Colsbrew in two rounds.
And logan paul says that he will defeat a man who can be this beastly🙂
My man Mike acting like a bully  At school Zoned out bro😂
Mike ya fighting fa real God can't bless ya when you act a fool now🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tyson literally acts out 2pac lyrics Remember Can't C Me?🤣🤣🤣
You zoned out Chill out🤣🤣🤣
Bro Mike zoned out
I can't make ya shake But i can make you fall😂🥊🥊
Mike you ain't in the street you doing sports bro  This ain't holy😂😂😂😂
He got his lick back So in my eyes Mike took a L Don't judge me😂
Ya dirty was shakin'😂
I can make a MF shake rattle and roll  -Tupac Shakur
Pac: I can make a mother fucker shake rattle and roll Mike Tyson: Hell yeah🤣🤣🔥
Ya streetfighting bro that's not professional🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Buddy literally lost it and went into streetfighter mode😂
Slumped that mans
Probably had a flashback when he was young in the hood, cause there are no bells/refs to stop any fights!!!
Not zoned out. In the zone.
Got damn hahahaha
Back when Mexican steroids didn't blow up your heart
Wow! Mike KO LOU.... frkn awesome ⚡
Mike vs Floyd street fight https://youtu.be/OR5k6gf3lQE
I’d need a rasie before I jump in front of a mad prime Iron Mike that’s not listening
He got some demons in him
He's a pit
If he's still up, he's going down 💪
Good job 👍
He wasn't zoned out. He was zoned in. He's an animal.
Tbf tyson isn't the most hinged person
He used to do shrooms b4 his fights fun fact
Mike going crazy on the referee! Looool! LMAO
Why wasnt Tyson disqualified ??
Does anyone know if he was just on a frenzy or was their beef between these two?
Beast mode on
“Zoned out”. You mean fucking crazy and on drugs.
Ghetto trash move
Tyson was the baddest man on earth!
They will fight two humans but foul up Michael vick'$ carrier for a dog fight !!!!!
NAH .....CAN'T LET U SAY THAT,IT WAS FARE HE WAS NOT ZONED OUT
Cuss d Mato helps him to control his mind. But after him, everything changed.
Wtf does zoned out mean?
When I played sports in school, I never heard the crowd noise becuz of my focus, similar to Mike here.
Mike back to the street fighter zone in this fight 🤣🤣🤣
Tysons a joke
Tyson should have been banned from boxing so many times
Cocaine
That's his way of revanging slavery so I'm gonna allow it.
His corner man didn’t come. That’s the awful part of this true incident
Because he was on coke
He's still standing so Tyson turned up the violence!which he doesn't like about himself.
Zoned out?!?!? More like zoned in! That’s Fierce focus and determination to win.
He wasn't zoned out he was coked out!! 🤯
Thats just an old school 3pm school yard flag pole last day of school type fight! A100 💪💯👍
It's how tyson did it tho he talks about it he doesn't like hurting people in the ring so he has to thonk differently about it and a different view
Tyson turned into ivan drago😂
He should have been disqualified for that
Again Tyson cheating
Literally
Tell it like head it was controversy behind the scene which made MT beat the Daylights out of that boy
Another day, another tomato can.
Rip to that referee
Mike tyso lost control? Surely not
This is the things that make me think why the people love this guy, mike tyson has big control problems, this guy shouldnt be an example of boxer, because this actions arent profesional in boxer and i saw another similarity actions of this same boxer, is really disgusting see this type of boxer, that promotes the use of his sport outside the ring and it is assumed that one boxes for the love of combat, not to hurt other people as this boxer does by biting ears and hitting individuals outside the ring, assimilating boxing with violence. It's a shame that a guy like that is a champion...
If only Deji would've fought like this
Tyson almost caught a murder case on that one 😂😆🤣
he wanted to kill him
Imagine the ref got hit with a clean hook lol
Eye of the tiger, rock
his bodyguard and childhood friend had just been shot and killed
I saw this happen in Hajime no ippo
He was on a shit load of shrooms
He wasn’t “zoned out”. He was keyed in.
Tyson just looked like those pit bulls in a dog fights
https://youtu.be/sJDcrxxkFSA
Buset biar vasit ditinju
This is bullshit
DQ tyson
Wow!
That was personal lol.
Imagine a pissed off zoned out mike tyson in his prime in a street fight, no knives no guns, no rules, just your body. Other dude would probably get killed
Pittbull .
He was like a wild blood thirsty lion!
Man is a psycho...
I would put him in jail that was legit assault
Actually looks like he came back to really at the end
Dude's an animal.
He went off because that guy symbolized everything he hates
You dangle a piece of meat in front of a Lion what do you expect. The lion to stop and turn away. 😆
Fighting until he fall that's was the game 🤣🤣🤣
Rapist thug
I zone out driving and wonder how tf I got home
Thats whet boxing wasn't  a set up match  like now used to enjoy those fights
I remember this fight.  I watched it
Cocaine is a hell of a drug....
Zoned out! Or do you mean high on drugs????
Imagine how he acts with woman, when he doesnt get his way, 😳😳😳 #ConvictedRapist
Steroids
You cant see the guy still swinging at Tyson? Smh he wasn't zoned out
He’s more a man today than he was then he was just a out of control animal back in them day’s. Still can’t forget that he was a legendary champion fighter tho
Scary for him I know because he hated that guy he became
Best boxer ever but couldnt control his rage and nearly gave a man brain damage. Pretty sure thats the exact opposite of what Ali did. Everyone wanna talka bout Tyson now like he some hero, they forget he is literally a convicted rapist.
That's happen when you get hypnotised to kill
Zoned out? Nah you mean coked out
He was hypnotized before every fight .. that's why.  Look at all his fights .
Poor fella
I watched this entire fight on YouTube just now and he genuinely wasn't mad or upset with this guy. He literally just zoned out and went on auto pilot.
If throught be known, TYSON who I worship was the most frightened man in that ring but sure most people I have met lately can't see past there nose lol
I think I would rather dive head first into a gorilla enclosure than throw myself in front of Mike Tyson like that Ref.
The king does what the fuck he wants!
Ref has balls of steel to come in the middle on Mike throwing punches
Logan is f 🤣 pray for his soul 😁
Even mike tyson is afraid of the person he becomes when he sets foot in the ring
🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣
Hypnotist is like whoooops
He explained it in the interview he was scared before each fight he wasn’t zoned out. Fear took over and he wanted to beat that fear
And the Paul's think they have a chance against Tyson
Boxing is the game and him has right to be himself of him own game what I mean here was that outside the ring him was like different 👍 we gotta learned from it
The best fight I seen was Tyson vs Douglas... When Douglas smashed Tyson.. a lesson in humiliation for Tyson big time.
Everyone there is lucky he zoned back in lol.
That's a goddamn savage animal
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yea he was zoned out lol if that’s what you wanna call it I guess
Boooom
Shroom. Fact
Mike was on drugs this fight… interview after Mike sounded insane
Thought his prime was mid 80s
That referee most indeed be one of the bravest man to walk the earth.
The greatest man mike tyson lost control
Love tyson ❤ 💙 🙌 ♥ 👏 💕 ❤
🤣🤣🤣 anybody hear the first punch affect!?
Tyson is a beast
any fighter than loses his emotions like that is never the greatest.
That is Mike. ( I am glad I were not inside the ring.)
He was punishing him for our ancestors

Surprised that ref can move that fast with them 200kg balls of steel 🤣
"Cus died before he could teach me how to turn it off, how to control it to live with it." -Mike Tyson
God bless you all and your families 🙏🏽✝️
The old mike is not like the current Mike. He was a beast back then.
Tyson was circumstantial. Put anyone in his position, theyd become the same.
I would call that zoned IN
Tyson:if he dies he dies
Dayz hhh unrepeateble
Mike Tyson I love who he’s become now greatest boxer of all time in my opinion
Now for real… how would you want to stop Tyson? Electroshocker? I have no clue how else to stop hin in this case… you can’t hold him..
Surprised Robin even has a face.
Mike said he couldn’t hear the ref
That is a sign of weakness
“Zoned out” 😂
He obviously kept going on purpose.  Why? Only he knows.
lol so many people justifying this just because it’s Tyson. He wasn’t “zoned out” he new wtf he was doing he just wanted to hit him more.
Back then, was there a time when Mike Tyson wasn't out of control?
And he should have been disqualified  for manhandling  the ref
What's new🍺
zoned out = coked out 😂
Yeah you heard him he said he was on shrooms and cocaine and shit
Dude wouldn't stop that's why he kept beating him 🤦‍♂️
Zoned out? You mean zoned in!
I love Mike he always Ben a beast. But also has a  heart as  a car at the same time very humble guy...
This wasn’t in 2000. This was way before that. Look how young Mike looks
This is the reason why Mike said he is afraid of younger him. He was just an animal and could flip at any time
I'd have Mike Tyson coach me since he's a GOAT in Boxing history
I like the 2022 Tyson better
Iron Mike Forever, Forever Iron Mike
And Jake Paul wants to take on this dude
He was on shrooms 😂
People don’t understand it’s hard to “unzone” out. Having to turn on a switch where you have to put all of your power into beating the ahit out of a guy and then having to turn it off is not easy. Either that or Mike was crazy but ima go with both
He didn’t lose control .. lmao the fight was all go at that point ain’t no chill until the bell goes off
JeeZUS!? Look at Mike's eyes FOCUSED IN ON him! He never let his eyes off the target! Dude was init to winit
Thats gonna be Logan Paul when he gets eaten alive by Iron Mike
Tyson never did anything that other boxers didn’t do in The ring.🙄🙄
Zoned out, thats a new one
The DMT told him to not stop 🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 the sound effect in the first knockout
He wasn’t zoned out!
I know I shouldn't but damm those punch sound effects lmao funny af
Yeah but that time he bit off evander holyfield's ear he was totally in control
I do the best food reviews check me out!!
He wasn’t zoned out he was zoned in!!!
This is on the ref. If Lou gonna stand in there and take it and is still defending himself keep that my ref behind the action. Ref attempted to stop it too soon. Now I'm pissed.
Cocaine is a he'll of a drug
When Mike Tyson himself is scared of his own rage, you know you don't want to be against that.
We should commend the ref for his bravery stepping out in front of those haymakers like that
This guys sounds just like JCS
Couldn't do it to Evander.
He's on cocaine in that fight.
The ref deserves props for throwing himself in front of Tyson's punches like that.
this must be the tyson that tyson himself doesnt want.
Loved watching Buster Douglas knocking him out.
Adrenaline is hella of a drug
No wonder mike Tyson is scared of his fighting personality
Thats a street fighter
Not zoned out, zoned in. So focused he didn't noticed, that's called zoned in.
It’s pronounced sava-Reece
What the hell does ‘zoned out’ even mean?
Tyson forgot that he wasn’t in the streets for a second there, ain’t no stopping to that punching train
I like how Lou keep punching pretending he still in a fight.. 😂😂
He explained it in the interview he was scared before each fight he wasn’t zoned out. Fear took over and he wanted to beat that fear
*Stops when he noticed the ref*
That old man risked his life doing that. One accidental, punch and he's seeing stars and wheeling himself down the sidewalk
That dude was trying to inbetween trying headlock Tyson and didn’t exactly go down, so Tyson was like “let’s keep getting it!”
I don't know what came over me. I just felt ferocious, in my Mike Tyson voice. Hahaha lol 😆😂
Who won tho?
I remember when my mom told me how when she was in high school no one messed with her bc my grandfather looked like Mike Tyson 😭
That guy wasn't done he was still grappling lol let em keep going ref!
I can see why Tyson says he doesn't like that guy he used to be and he doesn't like to let that animal out of the cage.
He was on Coke during this fight, got fined 200k for it.
Mike had some easy fights.
Being humble at old age is nothing impressive. Being humble at young age is impressive.
This would be different now with gas prices.
And people act like Logan  Paul can win Mike Tyson he old but he still the goat
I want you to destroy him! Destroy him until nothing is left!  OK!!!
That would be terrifying
i wouldn't say zoned out, he was ZONED IN
This is one of the reason I hate Tyson personally, the guy always loses control like a child having temper tantrum and still people giving him respect but other athletes who barely shit talks gets all the hate
Damn, now I know why he was so afraid of his old self
Y’all don’t understand what a fighter is, he’s in the zone he ain’t mike, he’s trying to kill that guy and will let nothing stop him which is why it’s so hard for him to stop sometimes like this
This is why you don't hypnotize your students 💀
Thats called being zoned IN, not out
Of course you didn’t know he was constantly on drugs this isn’t surprising
Boi stop stop stop
God Bless Y’all🙏🏽 Spread the Gospel🙌🏽
You wanna see trooper fessialism? Do you wanna see true dedication to your job? That referee put himself between Mike Tyson and something Mike Tyson was trying to destroy.
coked out*
Killer instinct!  Lord, I would have been trying to climb out the ring.
Was there a reason for him to lose control? Did the other opponent shit talk him or was it just Tyson in a mode and couldn't get out?
The greatest heavyweight champion of the world is only human also..Much love Mike.
Hey florid im missing a pin can you get me one?
*“Just would like to say thank you for these great shorts” 💗*
The guy should have stayed down
Geeked out
Yes let's have 2 6feet tall men in 250lbs of pure muscle and professional  training level of MMA but then let's hire refs that are older than dirt and probably  never been in a fight in there lives to try and stop the match
I don't think the ref should have stopped it like that that guy was about to hit the mat again and that would have done it
He was in perfect control, and on a mission.
Mancherian Candidate type sh^t
Zone out ok 👌 mean coked out
can you imagine arguing and fighting in social media for someone we dont know or ever will meet?
Tyson was always a dirty fighter and a racist
Cocaine is a hell of a drug…
In these types of situations you just gotta play dead 🧙🏾‍♂️👌🏽
I remember watching that fight live, and all I can say is I don’t blame Mike Tyson, Lou Savarese should’ve been hurt more. I like that Mike was in the zone
Yeah some white people are always over irritating imagine that Logan Paul or who ever keeps poking Tyson hope he gives him more than in 2000
He got up and said 👁 👄 👁 😂😂😂
Don’t fuck with that man’s pigeon
Drugs bro.
That is fucking terrifying. That’s like someone tryna get a bear off ya.
Mikes coke faze 🥴🥴😳😳😬😬
Ayt
It’s for real, for me just wrestling in high school I get so zoned out I have no idea what’s going on
Ah but with Lennox
Mike was good at fighting but he was a punk tbh
This is the match where he had gonorrhea
Because he took shrooms
Okay that punch sound effect was that necessary bro🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He monzter logan paul has lost ot daying he could beat mike
“If he’s still standing up, that bums outta luck” - Tyson
I remember his opponent was a huge fan of Mike Tyson. He became a boxer and trained for years for one day be face to face with Mike. It was very disappointing to see Mike act that way and disappointing to see a 20 sec sht
Tyson said on an interview that he channels his temper before a fight. Rage is one hell of an emotion. Easy to get in to, hard to get out
Cause of cocaine
Tyson was just having fun☺️
Shit bro was zoned out to dude hit Tyson in the body and the head at the end when Tyson stopped.
Damn ❗❗ ❗❗
Danggggggg
Zoned out!??? Thats a fuhched up term that could mean anything. Mike has stated numerous times in recent interviews that he does not like that ANGER side of him.
He truly was a different person in the ring
At least he didn't bite him
I love Mike Tyson now but honestly how tf was this guy allowed to do any type of boxing. Biting people's ears off, getting high and completely disobeying and ignoring the ref. Like wtf is boxing... Anything goes. You could probably rip someone's head off but as long as people like you, you won't get in trouble or banned.
“In my zone” damnit Boi!!!!!
I love the cocaine, I love cocaine, on my coach in the ring.
Zoned out. Called rage buddy
He did bring him on the show
No he stopped
https://youtu.be/vUDZoBOLuWE
Damn he was legit confused at the end
Thought the clip was going to be of Holyfield getting his ear bit off.
He did say when he enter that ring he becomes a man he don't like
Should have let the fight go on the guy was still standing
Then he be like "My opponets are usually on the ground before I win.. I didn't think I won already since he was still standing"🤣
easy answer he bites someone
Can’t wait to see this man humble Logan.. maybe some light brain damage.
Hes like my bad. The duration of the berserk mode was 10 secs.
Too many shrooms ig
Its stuff like this that makes mike Mike. People have faked this 'move' since, but there's only one Mike t
reeee
That ref ain’t that punch thooo
"Cus died before he could teach me how to turn it off, how to control it to live with it." -Mike Tyson
Mike should’ve been disqualified and fined. He could’ve injured the ref also. Out of control smh
Was he also zoned out when he assaulted woman?
Props to the red for risking his life to save another’s 😫
Warrior gene.
He was coked up in this fight
Spartan rage 😡
When has he had control
Nah the fight wasn’t done, Tyson and the other fighter knew that.
I think you got “zoned out” and “zeroed in” mixed up
Not sure why anyone would fight this man lol
Why would U willingly fight this man😂😭😭
It was the very  moment that  IronMike terminated the ref that Lou finally understood how it felt to be Sara Conner.
Wow
I was at that fight. It was an awful night with an awful card.
My nigga was literally on demon time
This is why we need to stop having short fat old men as referees in combat sports. He has to be able to physically intervene if necessary.
I love this type of animosity, it’s ruthless
Just want to say thank you for always bringing great content! I love these! ❤️
Mike Tyson in his prime was more dangerous than a damn Grizzly Bear. who agrees?
He was looking away stopped fighting and still blocking his punches at the end 🤦🏾‍♂️
i feel bad for him
Beast master
That man probably saw mr reaper while tyson is mauling him
Ref didn’t need to come in. Only way they can stop a match is if they are knocked out cold or the boxers cornermen through in the towel. Tysons opponent was literally standing and still punching
Tf is this shiet? Tyson, literally, told the ref that he hadn't heard the bell... u can even see it in the video. It had nothing to do with the corner man lmao.
That is one brave referee 😳
I paid for this shit 😭 was alwaysthe risk with a tyson fight, over within minutes.
When adrenaline kicks in you don’t know wtf ur doing. Happens in pro sports all the time. Honestly it’s hilarious sometimes. NFL players getting pushed on the sideline after a play and they just keep goin 😂
This is a prime example of what he said in a recent interview saying he would cry before every fight because he knew what type of person he becomes in a fight and he hated it. This man's become so humble and changed
No
Cocaine’s a hellava drug - Rick James voice
He said that’s a whole different person when he’s in there.
Zoned out so he threw the ref to the ground. Got it.
He knows he was hitting him but played it out at the end. Lets go Mike
Tyson was looked amazing when fighting useless BUMS   Not so good against the bad guys      FFFFFAAAAACCCCCTTTTTSSSSS
Did he win
So Tyson doing another thing that's illegal who would've guessed
Couldve killed that man.
What's cool is that in most of his knockouts, he always checks on his opponents afterwards
You do not zone out the referee. Ignoring the ref is exactly what he did, its not rare when you are dealing with insane overly aggressive steroid induced rage fits!
He's not a bad man
Naw boi was still standing so fair game
Mike a real mf💯
I definitely wouldn't say that Mike was so zoned out like this dude is claiming he was cause that's the total opposite of what he was.  He was actually so in the zone and focused on what he was there to do that he didn't even notice that the ref was trying to break up the fight.  He was so laser focused on knocking that dude the hell out and finishing what he was there to do that absolutely nothing else was going to distract him from completing his goal. How the hell does this guy think that Mike was in any way zoned out? That's just bs and sounds like this dude is just a hater that doesn't know what he's talking about
He was kinda a douche back in the day but he’s pretty dam humble now days but old age does that to a man
Tyson was on more drugs than anyone could believe he was probably shroomed out thought Lou was a sleep demon the fact he fights those is wild but I believe it
He maybe looked at as an old man now but back in the day...he was explosive. Fights were awesome for the limited time they lasted. Buster Douglas n his 20 count got lucky
He was cracked out
The rapëst man
We need refs that aren’t old or fat.
😂😂😂
What do you mean zoned out?
"zoned out" .....sure😏
Zoned out or zoned in?
More like Coke out
“Then i I started thinking too myself what did he do to make then niggas that mad” 🔥😂
He's grown a lot as a man, since then.
Gives meaning to when he says on some interview "I don't like the guy that comes out when i fight..." or something of the sort. Dude had demons and used them power to him.
Coke
Killer in instinct
Savaraisie🤣
When you cant get out of the beast mode
He was on cocaine in this clip no joke!
The Opponent should have stayed down since he was Shaking  Tyson should have stopped....
Mike never lost control. He knew exactly what he was doing, if the fight ends 26 seconds in round 1 the crowd is pissed and probably so is mike. They paid for a good fight, he wanted to beat the brakes off him & at least give the crowd a good show for what they paid for.
if he still standing deez hands is landing😂
This is a phenomenon most athletes refer to as "being the zone".
this nigga was on cocaine during this fight 😂😂😂😂
Cobra 🐍 kai 🤔 no mercy
Tyson never beat anyone good except old Holmes
He didn't "zone out" how do you call that being zoned out
Poor Lou.. Mike trying to kill
Let him knock him out....damn
Let Mike smoke 💨 all the weed he wants.
ROMANS 1:16 FOR I IM NOT ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD FOR IT IS THE POWER OF GOD FOR SALVATION TO EVERYONE WHO BELIEVES.
The people in the comments trying to justify what he did is just hilarious 😹
Zoned out? Choose your wording carfully
The 🐐 Of 🥊 ing Real Spill💯👿🦾
It’s like in Kickboxer, where Kurt throws in the towel and Tong Po kicks it out and then proceeds to break Eric’s back.
Why is no one impressed that Lou survived that
That referee has the courage of a Lion
He was in a bad mood.  Hahahahahaha....
No wonder Mike says he hates that version of himself.
Tyson was a bull. He would bite if you let him too
"Zoned out" too many nose beers
As he should
Any other boxer does this and he's a scumbag but Mike tyson does it and it's OK? Should of got a lifetime ban
Just looking at the size difference, Iron Mike the shit!
He is a mentally challenged man child that didn't have a clue how to handle his emotions. Brilliant to let the guy be a professional boxer
That's funny
To be fair you can’t blame Tyson he has a mental disorder
Steroid rage is a real thing. I'm surprised cyclist are not allowed to use steroids, but boxer are.
I’ve been there when the other person hella bigger or taller then yu and they Kant handle what yu giving them yu be like Dammm that’s all yu kan do big Dawg Lmaooo
Man was having too much testostrone
Iwa bayiza mike
He wanted to slump det man lmaoo
“Zoned out eh” ok..
Look up “crazy mike Tyson quotes “
Looks like Tyson lost a bit of muscle mass , but still a scary sight
The kind of childhood this man had, takes a lifetime to settle. Much respect
26 seconds , lol
THE WAY HE LOOKS SO CONFUSED HAS ME DEAD
https://youtu.be/SuO4DjC3bGM
This is disrespectful to sportsmanship
Seems like everyone is giving Tyson a free pass for this, but this is the exact sort of thing which can cause life altering injuries.
He was on coke
That’s was a unfair fight.
I think I seen a turd fall out Lou's trunks😂🏳
Sickem!!! 🐕
This happens to men all the time
Cheque drops do weird things
Tyson is a god
Did he get disqualified?
And that’s just one of the reasons Mike Tyson is loved by so many.
Coke
I love you vids
Being a boxing ref takes nuts. Imagine being an untrained fighter and accidentally taking a punch from prime Tyson.
Early stoppage
I think Mike has tunnel vision when he gets into the ring.  He's too focused on the flight to notice other things happening.
That's not zoned out. He was dialed in and hyper focused.
I have a tremendous amount of respect for anybody who had the balls to step in the ring with a prime Mike Tyson
repent for all of your sins
Tyson is a violent piece of shit and we all know it. Yeah, he was successful at the sport, but in all honestly, he was a thug at best and a sadist at worst a lot of the time.
I think the ref would have had most success by just picking one of Mike's arms and holding it back with all his strength. I wonder if he'd be able to fully hold just one of his arms back.
Crazy how he didn't do it to be grimey. He literally didn't even see the ref or acknowledge what was going on. Straight tunnel vision.
Ref was screaming stop mike u going to kill him.🤣🤣🤣
Mike was taking his opponents punches… while staring at the Ref and talking UNFAZED.   Mike *IRON* Tyson 🥊
He didn’t follow the most important rule in a fight. Don’t let the adrenaline get to you
Mike Tyson was aggressive, rude, abusive and out of control. By no means he was a good sportsman.
By pushing him down he means punching him
true warrior
Tyson lost this fight as soon as he threw the referee ... Tyson changed the gentleman sport into shit ...
This is difference in muhamed ali and mike tyson cuz when he saw his opponent in bad situation he didnt stop attacking and muhamed did opposite he let the referee stop the fight so his enemy would avoid a serious injuries
COCAINIUM!!!!
He was high on cocaine
Tyson was beating him like he did something to his mother 🤣🤣🤣
Menace
mike tyson on coke is an american treasure
If I’m the ref I would give the fight to his opponent
Difference between Ali and him.
When You are a fighter, it’s hard to get out of the zone especially if the opponent is still fighting you
Y’all forget  Tyson isn’t exactly stable in the head
He is always out of his senses 😂
Mushin Mike
Mike Tyson was high back in them day
Not even a professional ref who has been trained and even him couldn't beat Mike tyson
It was a lack of discipline on Tysons part end of  Fuck zoned out n all that bullshit  Tyson back then was a bullying prick who couldn’t control himself  He’s a reformed character now though
It was the drugs getting to him
Same excuse for eating the ear?
CTE is strong with this one 😂😂😂😂
Zoned in* is more like it
It shouldn’t have been stopped other dude was still fighting that’s why Tyson kept fighting
This where he said he been doing a lot of drugs ahhh I see it now . Kids don’t do do drugs
I’ve never in my life liked mike Tyson I don’t know why I keep getting recommended this
I wonder if he was zoned out because he was on shrooms.
He was in the zone
I respect Tyson for him finally changing his demeanor now that he is aging. But he still did alot of terrible things in his prime.
Zoned out ? More like Zoned In 😆 🤣
I know exactly who that mans character is in tysons punch out . He fell with them knees side to side lol
Era un León
This is why he's battling with so much right now, seeing his opponent defenseless, and he steady punching this man, even when the ref gets in the middle,he kept beating his ass, even pushed the old ref down, just so that he could continue beating the mess out of his opponent, it's clear to see that Mike had anger problems, and he should have gotten some help, mike Tyson was very dangerous, it's very nice that he has changed his life around and learned from his mistakes
Some fighters have killer instinct. Tyson honestly had murder instinct.
Mike looks like the little brother that gets bullied and finally snaps
My Brother mike Ali
He wasn’t zoned out Mike had a lot of problems with white people the second he started hanging out with members from (NOI.)
Dude must’ve said something about Ali.
He was of the shrooms!!!
like this has never happened before
When Lou struggled to get up and was shaking the referee should’ve finished it there . The only reason it was continued was for a highlight ko to please the fans .
Relentless focus. He was a dangerous man in that state.
Tyson hit him so hard he got up looking like officer doofy from scary movie lol
“Oh u Thhhaid thop”
😭😭😭 ref had it bad with that man in the ring
Not zoned out poor sportsmanship
This is the boxer Jake Paul thinks he can beat smh
Fkkn king. Fk ali tyson would have smashed him if they were able to fight
That’s why he said he didn’t like this scary version of Himself
Aaand yet again a great example of how horrible and nasty of a fighter tyson was. Seriously youtube shorts need to stop praising this guy.
General
It's sad to see how Mike is afraid of his own former self. He doesn't see any value in it anymore. (He was bleeding for garbage)
Tyson: "Lay down and go to sleep."   Lou: "nah I'm good let's go."  Tyson: "ah, so you chose death."
I like how Tyson is just like 😐huh?
He’s a beast!!
He shoulda been DQed
I'm a big fan of Mike Tyson back in the day, still am to a point, but he's lucky, because If I was the ref he'd have been disqualified without a shadow of a doubt.
He was on the way down , Mike hit em to keep him from falling
Referees for these kind of sports should be required to have training in some type of grappling when things like this are prone to occurring.
Its steroids people steroids
Just letting y'all know you can't beat. The black man . Stop talking shit before a fight
Good job ref. Fearless
In 2000 the baddest man was Lennox Lewis
Coked out his mind
That's how he gon do logan Paul 😂😂😂
That wasn’t even prime Mike lol
Never a dull moment with Mike... until Roy JJ 🥱😴
Ref deserves a Medal of Honor for risking his life to protect bro from Tyson
Shrooms
Gordon Ramsey watching the fight
I really don't know how to feel about Mike honestly. For sure he is the greatest of all time but man, seeing this shit here is so disappointing and upsetting like how can you ignore the ref to keep fighting a dude who's obviously down have some more self awareness
All that coke lol
He was lost at this point and on his way out and just unnecessarily braggadocios for no reason. I enjoyed the quiet tyson of the early 90s
That ref coulda stopped all those punches with his massive titanium balls, major props for stepping in front of a swinging zoned out Tyson
I think you mean zoned in, average people smh
Context?
Jesus save this man
He was doing cocaine isnt that cheating?
That’s zoned in, not zoned out
Tyson is insane so it makes sense
When u see red.. its hard to get out that mode. Those who been there know what I'm talking about
Love tyson. He's the GOAT.
Yoooo
Cocaine is a helluva drug - Rick James 🤣
Tomato cans!!!!! That’s all he ever beat
He explained it in the interview he was scared before each fight he wasn’t zoned out. Fear took over and he wanted to beat that fear
He had it many shrooms that day
Tyson was in another planet 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Tyson should of been banned and arrested
He thought the referee was against him.
Tyson is the definition of a liability. He can’t control himself inside or outside of the ring. He’s everything you don’t want in a man capable of violence.
Zoned out on cocaine
The ref deserves props for throwing himself in front of Tyson's punches like that.
No more funding for Mike Tyson at all ! You must control your temper ! Zone back in it’s so ordered FSSSSP any and all other courts are vacated pertaining to no more funding or fighting until you control your temper ! Mallet
Wish Jake Paul could fight prime Tyson. I would love to see that!
This the fight when he was on coke??
That was Mike Tyson just being a prick (I like Mike Tyson for ref)
I wonder what the Jake Paul exhibition will be like
Ain’t no reason to stop until that man lands on the ground or your gonna be given a W anything else is irrelevant.
That’s because he ate a fistful of shrooms prior to the fight 😂
Im glad he's out of this and has found peace ! His trainers were so disgusting
Coked out.
is this the time when his daughter..？you knoe..？
Man I’ve never seen mike without his Tattoo it’s weird I’m so used to it
Mike himself said that he didnt know the round has ended.
The ref tried stopping him and he still ain’t stop that def should of been a disqualification the same thing he pulled on Holyfield this the L Tyson took you can’t bring the streets into the ring
Im sure Tyson has a personality disorder. He’s talked about how he becomes a difference person when he’s fighting and he doesn’t like it
They say Mike used to get hypnotized before some fights. Cus was a hypnotist also
"I was a killer. These guys nowadays are businessmen." -iron mike tyson
Tyson fought bums
Zoned out or something else out 😂
Zoned out or zoned in?
Hypnosis effects maybe
The way Mike looks at the ref when his sideman comes up, he's just like ah shit, what'd I do?
Honestly don't think he lost control, the ref stepped in between them cmon now
Dude used the 8th gate on em.
I'm pretty sure that he said some things that made him mad before this occurred.
This is what fighting on c-oke looks like
Should that have disqualified him?
Low life.
Ayo Get Inside , The Shorty with Lisps Lost it
Do you think Muhammad Ali was better than Bruce Lee just asking I like both
Disqualified
I like Tyson now but y'all are excusing his behaviour when he was clearly just being a bully back then.
It ain't the size of the dog , it bout the Dog in the fight 🤫😉😳😄😄
Grrrr 🤫😉😄😄
I feel bad for the poor guy!
💯"TRUE HISTORY"🍾🥂🥩🤓🇺🇸
Must be 1 of his "mushroom" 🍄 fights!
Like you said "baddest man on the planet"
Not zone out he had to put the white boy down because he already understand the situation people Playing The race card
That would be so fucking scary
He wasn't zoned out he knew exactly what he was doing and its fucking dreadful sportsmanship
So tired of these dumb videos
Cocain a hell of a drug
Mike really is a crazy dude though
Mike lost, right? Easy disqualification
I think he was too zoned in
Dang aye Tyson gotta quote for that but bro a humble person tho💯
Yep. A mixture of drugs, adrenaline, and hypnosis! Some people don't know this but cus actually had Mike hypnotized because he was too nice! Go look at his earliest fights and he would knock guys down in the first round and then play with them for 2 more rounds cuz he didn't wanna hurt them like that. Cus had to bring the animal out in him
Fun fact: Tyson was high on marijuana
You lose control. You lose.
“Ima roofless mothaPhuckaa”
Don queen ruined Mike. If his original coach hadn't die so soon, Mike would be undefeated to this very day... 💯
The fact he seen his corner men then stopped
Better let Jake Paul know.
In the zone auto zone
Zoned in*
They were only really breaking up the fight when the white guy started reacting...
ESTE COMPA SIEMPRE ME A CAIDO MAL ASTA HOY ESTÁ MUY MAL DE LA CABEZA
If you can't pronounce dudes name correctly, don't make a video about him
It's that illuminati demon controlling him
I can honestly say that I have never actually beaten Mike Tyson in a fist fight. Seriously, I have not. He is a hard fellow.
Hypnotised
That's honestly pathetic
Not the baddest man, not even close. I can name 5 guys off the bat that are better and badder than Tyson. Also much respect to the guys for not going crazy on Tyson after Tyson pulled that bs!
Nah he ain’t zone out he zoned In
Listen...he made mistakes...we all do!! He's just misunderstood. He lived a bad 😞 lmao shit. Blah blah blah. He's a fucking waste of shit. The fact they still bring him up is great. He himself turned his entire life into a walking contradiction. The best part is all that he did....he is a broke homie from the worst place possible......his head!!!!!
It's what a massive amount of steroids tends to do to someone. I don't think anyone doubts he wasn't juicing given the admission of Tyson about how he had his fake urine sample techniques. I'm not even sure if Tyson would have even known they were juicing him.
Mike Tyson in his prime will be ali in his prime
Tyson was like a pit bull n a Rottweiler attacking
Props to lou for staying up after all of that though
If he hasn’t murdered at least one person, I’d be surprised
It’s not a mistake✨ it’s a masterpiece✨
It’s not a mistake✨ it’s a masterpiece✨
He was whaling on his because of color
"Iron" Mike Tyson is brast
You mean coked out not zoned out lmao
Wow
Imagine the pure dread and fear Lou must've felt when he saw Tyson push the ref off him (if he was even fully conscious.)
I think we was more zoned in, than zoned out.
He was high as shit..... No. Not on weed
That's because this wasthe fight he admitted to have been off Cocaine
If I was Mike at that moment, I’d be doing the same. The opponent talked a bunch of trash talk and Tyson felt 20 seconds wasn’t a proper beat down for a man who deserved a long ass whooping. He was mad the ref called it so quick. He wanted to break his opponent
Killa Mike in effect 🥊🥊
Bro was possessed he wanted to end him
"Zoned out"
The ref became racist this day😂
Man was on autopilot
His first mistake was stepping in the ring with that Mad Man.
He was a mess. He’s come a long way. Love this guy.
when you fight an actual tiger
ForcenCD or whatever..Still the baddest man on the planet..Facts!!
He wasn't "zoned out" he was high on coke
That's because Mike is a loser dirty fighter couldn't beat nobody that was any good
This white dude called tyson the n word
Mike Tyson in a interview said he never hurd the Referee telling him to break or get off
Everybody gets that’s feeling in sports or anything that’s causes a made adrenaline rush if mike caught him in a alley he would’ve been beat to a pulp🤣🤣
Don’t get it wrong the baddest man is ROCKY MARCIANO 🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹  49-0 only an Italian could do that!!
He has zero honor as a fighter
The sound effect of the punch that knocked him down got me rolling
Me turning my volume up. “NoW TeLl ME WhAT YoU HEarD
man said he did blow before every fight so
Yep ,but he didn't lose control with lennox )))
Mike Tyson badass
If any other fighter would've done that people would be furious lol
“Ignored the ref…by pushing him down” lol
Tyson should of been disqualified 😨
You wanted a Monster you got Jekyl and Hide all in 1.
He had a shit life,but who hasn't
Zoned in not out
This was in Hampden after prison. Must have had some bucky in him. Ledge
Zoned out? Or HIGH ON DRUGS?  Call it what it is.
This is the guy how cheated to muhamed Ali and it was a payback for him tespect mikeTyson
He wasn’t Zones out he was probably gone on mushrooms
"Zoned out"
Thats not loosing control, these boxers get paid to knock their opponent down and when ur focused u dont see a referee. Killer instinct taking over.
Honestly, this kinda thing really happens to zoned in athletes. I remember my sophomore year I went to state in wrestling, and I got do focused on what I was doing in a match it took me 5-10 seconds to realize the period ended and the ref blew the whistle.
Thats why Coke is bad
Thavage
And that’s why he does shrooms
The Bible says all have sinned and none are good. Nobody could ever be good enough to enter into heaven. In fact everyone deserves hell for our multitude of sins against a holy God.   But you can be saved and reconciled to God. Recognize your corruption. Recognize Jesus as Lord and Savior who raised Himself from the dead. Ask Him to rescue you. He shall not turn you away.  Put your complete faith and trust in Christ. He is your Lord/King/God.  And you are His. Bought with a price. His blood was shed so that you might believe and be set free from sin and death. And once you are His, He will lead you into obedience as evidence of your faith. You will become a new person 💛
Fun fact, mike was on COKE during this match, which could explain how he couldn't really control himself in this match.
He still had some powder in him from the previous night .🤣
Hoping same thing will happen with logan lmao
He probably was disappointed in the 26 seconds and needed to punch him some more 🤷🏻
Who knows what fighters say to each other before and during a fight Tyson wasn’t zoned out he was in a rage  and probably felt disrespected by something that fighter said
Sheesh
Because his opponent was white. If the roles were reversed people would be screaming “racist” “hate crime”!!
This beating i approve lol tyson is the man
God those dudes need aggression control.
That's a brave ref
Mike was like you put me here to end this man, that I shall do, he is not yet ended what are you doing sir
Mannnnnnnn just imagine being the other guy
I was at this at hampden park in Glasgow Scotland. I was a huge tyson fan and it ended up being probably the most disappointed i have ever been in my whole entire life Waited for months  “…right fights started… oh the fights finished….” Savarese got hit once and he started stumbling about like a new born giraffe .😂🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
My friend and an idiot was fighting and the idiot tried making me mad and brake his ribs 👌🤣😂👍 and I wanted to do it but just no no
He stopped way before his own ring came in,  watch the interview on it,  he stopped once the ref was in his eyeline,  his ring came in way after
He did not lose control he's a friend of my family and he dated my cousin and my other cousin was his counselor he didn't lose control but thank you for the video. He just didn't like the other guy it wasn't personal
Idk if this was when Cus was alive but he said he used to be Hypnotized before fights. So maybe that played a part in some of these instances but idk forsure just a thought
Mike tyson: I don't hear no bell and I don't see no ref. 😂
Tyson is a one of a kind human.
K.F.Whitey.
Lol yet the fight was stopped before he got there
His a worth less fitter
I believe this is the fight Mike had done Coke before hand, I think he got disqualified after
I always rooted for his opponents. I DO NOT LIKE HIM !!!!
Tyson is wrong for and the guy is stupid for getting in the ring. Now that's his fault.
The ref is supposed to put his arms around mike not the other guy. Refs fault!
Looking Mike Tyson now and who he was back then completely two different people
He was ❄ up
Should've been disqualified
Mike was like *he's still standing I'm gonna keep punching*
Hmnn
Mike Tyson was a freaking animal !!! I loved it
See Mike at the funeral wearing boxing gloves   "It's okay Mike...you killed him...now give it a rest!!"   Lol
Inky loco
"A man can't stand, he can't fight"
Gotta say: this was a confusing decision from the ref.
Man wtf 😂 imagine
Isn't he zoned in (on the kill) not zoned out?
Such a different man today
Mike is legend , weed makes mike a wiseman 😎👌🇧🇴
Zoned in you mean! DA
The Pride of Greenwood Lake NY.   Big Lou
Only reason I ever watched boxing. No 12 rounds.. 1 round fights only..
Its all the Winstrol hahaha. How about we recognize how brave that out of shape ref is haha
He was free but his mind was still living in prison.
Credit to Tyson for not being too zoned out that he would punch the ref
He really needed to hurt somebody that night and felt cheated with such an early knockout
Zoned out? ZONED OUT?!!  Bruh, that’s what you call ZONED IN…..
Yoooooooooooooo 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dude he did a lot of wild shit. "Zoned out" I think you mean high
He got high before each fight...facts
That's bullshit. Tyson wanted to hurt Lou Savarese when he was defenseless. That's attempted murder. It's unacceptable & unsportsman like. In contrast, Muḥammad Ali called the referee over when he noticed his opponent was defenseless due to too many blows to the head. Muḥammad Ali was declared the winner. That's one more reason why he is/was the greatest boxer of his time.
I heard he did a line of coke before he walked out lol
Legends say that Tyson was a fan of YoungBoy.
Sometimes you have to be your own ref. And when the ref is being unjust, you have to justify yourself.
This dude mike tyson used hypnosis to train for and to fight during battle
Tyson is and always was a Simpleton..
Focus
THAT WAS DYNAMITE KID 💪🏾💯
No the reason Tyson went off was over racist comments before the fight. I'm old enough to rember this
To be fair the other bloke kept fighting lol  That was funny pushing the ref out the way ha ha
Killer instinct...fact
Tyson thought he was backyard boxing
Sa va razy? Lmao bro it’s REECE, like REECE Witherspoon, lmaooo tf is a sa va razy?
The bum abuser
Yeah the zone a dangerous place,
Nahhh mike just want to make everyone money are worth paid for the fight. I'm pissed off too if I've to paid to see the fight end in round 1 at 26 second. Not like he's lost control or anything he just appreciate the fans. Back then mike usually end the fight in early round but this fight he realize that. But the ref and everyone try to stop the fight. That's why he going super saiyan to keep the fight continue. Lol. Btw sorry for my englisch.
Hope he was disqualified for unsportmanslike conduct, what a diq
Lou just wanted a hug.
Should have been banned for life.
😂😂😂
Mike was like a Pitbull going for Blood On Hood
He was high AF
Every ref has a plan until they get punched in the face
I always liked Mike but I've just about had enough of all this praise for him. He puts his pants on one leg at a time like the rest of us.
He recently said he used to get hypnotized before every fight. Everyone thought it was just focus.
So? 🤔🤔
Still publicizing a convicted rapist!
I just wish he handled his money well during his prime.
Too much anabolic steriods
And you have a Logan Paul try to boxing Mike Tyson
That's what happens when you take drugs and they don't test or they cheat on the test. The baddest man turned out to be the biggest wimp as he got older
Well the thing is that in a interview mike admits that he absolutely hates the person he turns into when he fights it's like he has a split personality. Look at mikes face at the end he doesn't even know whats going on he's confused.
Ali seeing an opponent defenceless: I refuse to fight this man! Tyson seeing an opponent defenceless: hehe more punching
mike tyson dont care if he owned you, he wanted to knock you out.
I guess when your in the zone your in the zone literally
Year Im born, Iron Mike lost control because he zoned out into training mode, sounds about right
Should have been a DQ
Tyson used to do things like this to put the fear in future opponents. It wasn’t unintentional, it was an intimidation tactic.
he always lost control that's why he bite
That's drugs man..... Drugs.....
Un salvage que Salio del bajo Mundo .  Y not respecta Las reglas del boxeo como un deporte
I love Mike but he should have been disqualified and lost to teach him a lesson.
His fist were on autopilot 🤣
I can't stand tyson
Zoned out yeah he just admitted taking drugs before his fights like shrooms it might as well take a Vicodin
Mike was seeing red
That dude is definitely Quit boxing
Fuck that, that’s just bad sportsmanship
Nothing scarier than a late  '90s Mike Tyson.
You acting like Mike didn't know he new Mike was just a criminal thug back then
He didn’t lose he was aware of what he was doing 🤣🤣🤣💀
Lol and jake Paul says he will fight him
Tyson sux
He should have been disqualified for this
Kind of a bad interpretation of the matter
Cocaine's a hell of a drug
Tyson is a bad man
Brains 0  Beast 100
He admitted to ingesting mushrooms in numerous fights, he said that he never even felt hard punches, I don't blame him... If it works, it works
And logan paul is fighting this man…..oki
2000?! He knew what he was doing as a Vet...
beat that cralkka. I feel you tyson. tear his hear out
Definitely cocaine
Hate who convert to Islam after fault
Mike was a bum killer
That dude didn't give up, he is the epitome of not going down without a fight.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He smoked too much weed
LEGEND
hopefully hel do this to a paul brother
hopefully hel do this to a paul brother
Damn ,did that guy try and steal some of Mike's pet pigeons?
It's not his fault lmao 🤣 😂
Zoned in*
Fun fact Mike Tyson said sonny Liston made him look like a bad little kid.
The opposite of what Ali did in that situation. Salute to Ali.
Mike lost control because the big guy didn't fall down again..  Mike stops for 2 reasons.. he hears that bell. Or his opponent is on the ground. What a legend.
He does that everytime in his prime.
Tyson such a piece
He took it serious
He wasn't that   bad  ass with Lennox or holyfield was he
That's not when Mike Tyson lost control!
Horrible
Mike would need therapy for accidentally killing someone
1- Bruce Lee 2- Mohammed Ali 3- Mike Tyson
Mike in his 20s was a beast
Least he stopped man I'd hate to have that beast coming at me like that
Mike didn’t hit him! Lou did!
tunnel vision, he ain’t see nothin else but dead body in front of him.
What a clown
I’m pretty sure some real killers confronted Tyson and changed him. He is legit a better person now.
That would be the hypnosis
"I hated it. I didnt like the person that came with fighting." Mike Tyson 202x
Look up cheque drops if you wanna understand Tysons occasional uncontrollable rage
Be very carefull of your next words robots and friends, you are not getting any money, as the feed turned from galaxy, stars, universe.
Was prolly on mushroom
Hey good morning family first and foremost I want to give all praises to the most high I know him as Allah but he has many names you may call him whatever you wish that's between you and your God now listen Mike Tyson is still one of the baddest boxes on the planet of the Earth don't ever get it twisted I grew up watching Mike Tyson I was inspired by him and you don't have to like Mike Tyson but you going to respect Mike Tyson and I ain't talking about Tyson chicken and we dancing for no buttermilk biscuits special shouts out to Willie D of the geto boys and my favorite rapper of all times Brad Jordan rapper Scarface and before I go it is imperative to note that Scarface and the whole rap a lot bandwagon has never been afraid to speak truth to power may God  be pleased
the ref did What in the ring??
RIP Paul
Man his corner man didnt stop him he stopped himself 🙄
Sav-eh-REES  not raise-ay
Dude what's your problem with Tyson? All this lose control garbage every match. This the only caption you got or what, you bad at making up titles.
Cocaine
He legit looked around like, wtf going on??
"If he is still standing, my punches are still landing" Tyson.
Best ever
He would have KILLED his opponent
I don’t care if it’s YOUR pit bull, if he locks on to somebody, it’s no stopping him. Y’all ever see a pit bull as a person!? This is him lol
They don't call him the baddest for nothing
"Zonned out", steriod rage.....same thing?
So much for height matters. DANG.  7 inch difference.
Go mike
These are the results of coke gentlemen
Dude must of pissed Tyson off 😬
It’s like that scene in Batman the dark knight when bane loses control and and does crazy punches
Mike was a pos for that
True story I been in Mike's spot, it's real you fight till you know you won
Mike was pure rage in his day
Hypnosis.
Tyson is a coward.
Sabarese  should have been awarded the fight just to teach him a lesson.
Wtf the top comments all saying the same shit
Wasnt zoned out he was coked out...
He also did mountains of cocaine
He's one person I wanna meet before I pass
This mike tyson would destroy Mayweather
He did this just for the show. He looks bad in this light thats why
Drugs will do that to ya.
I’m honestly more impressed at how humble this man has become.
A Demond took over his body
Man must of said something crazy to Mike
Yea that's from all the talk the man was doing. Mike had to show him all that talk didnt matter
He was on crack
Rigged, everything rigged, Tyson is a bitch
#1300th #what
Dam
Today's tyson looks like it has done some redemption arc.
So this is the person mike Tyson hates the most? Understandable.
He used to be hypnotized not aware of his surroundings during fight.
Why is to much  masag same  same
Y'all be like "wow he fight'n his demons out there".  This is nearly attempted murder. Can we try not to glorify it? It's horrible sportsmanship. If you're so messed up in the head that you go into a blind rage while playing your sport, you should be going to therapy instead.
Тайсон, великий боец! Привет с России!
I bet savarese had to wash those shorts a few times💩🤣
He was probably on shrooms, he looks faded
Jesus Christ is returning repent!!!!!
MK ultra and Zoloft. DWIGHT MANN

Pitbull off the leash
Power of herbs 🌿
Tyson was a bad man back in the day as much as his fans love him he was evil. How he is great tho

10 Of The World's Funniest One Liners ever!  1. Never answer an anonymous letter.  2. I used to think I was indecisive, but now I'm not too sure.  3. Campers: Nature's way of feeding mosquitoes. 4. According to my best recollection, I don't remember. 5. As long as there are tests, there will be prayer in public schools.  6. Vacation begins when Dad says, "I know a short cut." 7.

If Barbie is so popular, why do you have to buy her friends?   Probably the most thought-provoking one-liners is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
Learn names...
That aint zoned out. That’s IN THE ZONE!
That is how he can do. When. Hes in his prime
Prime Tyson was not human man. When he got into the fight all you could do was get on your hands and knees and pray. Mike was just built like that.
ZONED out...thats we sayin..STOP IT😡 you mean he was on some type of drug. As an former boxer myself this should have been an automatic DQ period. 💯
UNDER HYPNOSIS
He has said he was high on coke during this fight
Ok if is enough is enough!
He got so zoned out he pushed the ref
I'm honestly more impressed at how humble this man has become.
Savage
We in remote cornwr of India wud visit neighborhood house to watch his match in late 80s. TV was luxury bqck then. Match was over by 1 minute.
Wow. https://youtu.be/ShWpYHyAiz4
Steroids......
I am honestly surprised nobody made a movie about him .
Damn he mad that dude real scary
In an interview which i am too lazy to loook up, mike tyson said that he was a different person when he entered the ring. Sort of like a beast. He loses control of himself and the beast is loose. He said that he is scared of that other personality he has.
The opponent punched Tyson in the groin. He got mad and you have not seen this again as there was no one stupid enough to do it again lol Way to go mike (CHAMP)
it is not a mistake lol is ✨ MASTERPIECE ✨
Coke
It was 26 seconds into round 1 and Tyson still had plenty adrenaline and testosterone to burn.
I like wrestling
Mohammad Ali was also in this same situation band he instead stopped the fight and asked Refree to stop it to save the competitor.
Down syndrome will do that
Lou  was embarrassing.........
Mike was coked out of his mind. Tyson the greatest boxer of all time.
He want zoned out he was in the zone
Now days they will take your win for that.  Some times fighters lose it man they are fighting...
Mike forgot it was a boxing match, homie  was street fighting!
lol "zoned out" my dude assaulted everyone in and out of the ring, he didn't give a fuck about anyone's safety or rules. he might be a changed man now, prison will do that to some, but pretending he was 'in the zone' is stupid.
Cocaine is a hell of a drug
All these people saying how tyson BECAME humble today as if they KNEW the guy. Y'all probably weren't even fkn born yet when this guy was fighting. WORD. don't know shit about Mike and don't know shit about people. Mike was always humble he just had a few rough patches. Try going through what he had to, a lesser person mentally would have died. His childhood, his relationships, getting robbed and accused of esxual assault, his struggle with addiction and losing one of his kids at a young age and who knows what else. Fk all y'all
I feel like a lot of people don't understand how intense combat sports are. When you're competing the pressure is on and you can only really focus on your opponent, let alone a coach or referee. And knowing Tyson, he probably didn't even realize that the referee was trying to stop the fight
I dont think this year is right , 2000?
Tyson on kill mode
No he just wanna beat that guyup
When Florid Miston was desperate for content
Listen kids, Mike Tyson used to be a monster.
大金を稼いだけど破産したし、 ボクシングのルールすら守れなくなって居たんだから、 最後は、もうサーカスのゴリラだったよな！
“zoned in” not “zoned out”
When I’m doubt, stop the bout
Tyson is human pitbull
That's a heavyweight Ronaldo he's fighting.
Tyson was a blessing and a curse to boxing. He was one of the best but also a real stain to the sport with all his elbows to the face, ear biting, arm bending in the clutch, black power muslim crap……He definitely is bi polar
THIS is the Tyson that even Tyson admits he doesn't want to see again. Mike Tyson genuinely lost control and was listening to his instincts. And his instincts was screaming kill.
Mike is a machine 😁
Had to go home to watch Tom & Jerry 😂
Him played for garbage 🗑
This was the Mike Tyson some still remember 😂
And people say khabib could win
Mike is such a genuine, humble person.
He regrets all this today...I'm glad he's now a changed man
Gosshhh, he's gonna kill him
A drug fuelled Tyson should of been banned from boxing. Is what the video title should be.
"Mike"was a good man and still a good man 🦸‍♀️
Jake Paul would knock this guy down in 15 seconds
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm sorry but is He still alive? 🤔🧐. I thought He was already dead ...
That coach is the baddest man
Shi😂
That's a lesson Kids... dont do drugs.

When the halotestin took over
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith                                                                /./.,,/.                            ,/.,  /.,/ ,/. / / ,,     /. ,/.,

Everyone talking about Mike but what about his opponent, the guy kept swinging to the end.
John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life🥰❤❤
He wasn't zoned out......he was a pos at that time in his life
Mike Tyson, a terribly dumb human being who can box like no other.
Remember when boxing was real?

If you fear death, read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Everyone talking like they know Mike Tyson personally. Yall r cringe
Iron mike was there to kill while mike Tyson was just hoping for him to stop if you know you know
That was so stupid
Steroids will do that to ya
Reminds me of this one  https://youtu.be/S-AM4bOE_ew
Bully
Are we not going to mention the time he  bit of evander holyfields ear. Or was that in control.
This is why Muhammad ali is the greatest
Guy was still punching back.
Here's something you might like https://youtu.be/s1Bk5aiEu9g
Mike always says that he's scared of the monster he was...
Tf dude why are there so many bot comments 😐
Coke out not zone out
Mike be focused tho
He always tried to kill his white opponents. Watch any of the fights he had with white dudes and you can see the difference. I mean, he beat the hell out of everyone without prejudice. But, with the white opponents, there was a noticeable amount of extra contempt.
IT'S ABOUT TIME Mr. IRON MIKE TYSON GETTING THE RESPECT HE DESERVES.
This is the Tyson that would beat Fury
Ref is a savage. Dgaf who/what mike is. Just putting himself at risk to save another man from Mike is enough to make him a legend
I was 20. I watched this shit live on ESPN
Why was that so !!!
Stopping Mike Tyson from  hitting his opponent must be like stopping a tiger from killing a deer. Imagine how the refree would feel when he would stop Mike Tyson from hitting his opponent anymore.
He fought so many bums and old guys what a patted record and when he fought real opponents he lost every time. Such and overrated fighter.
He really is the baddest man of all time!
STREETS.
Let’s not get it twisted Tyson was a bully. He has certainly come along way tho which is testament to how people can change
He looks like Ronaldo
He was focused.
He was high on cocaine thats why.
Mike Tyson is in his prime was so entertaining to watch because you never knew what was going to happen lol. surely!
Yeah, should've been disqualified for this
Nice
And Jake Paul wants some of that.. Yeah right.
He lost control when he started eating his opponent
That’s actually terrifying if you think about it. He was killer locked in. Zoned in. Kanye before an album, bron in that one Celtics game, he did not hear no bell, feel no ref, see no towel.
Mike has never seen someone get up from a punch before. It literally got him mad like "How dare you stand up!!"
Nasty fellow
Ye and that Paul fella wants to verse this lol. Go for it kid.
easy to enter Islam  just Say from heart♥️ I per witness that there is nothing to deserve to be worship except Allah and  Muhammadem messenger from Allah. congratulations . you are a Muslim now 💞
Look guys I rwspect Mike as much as the next guy but can we still have a moment of silence for Lou who was unfortunate enough to get in the ring with him at the time
If you watch the fight you can see Tyson mouth “I’m sorry” to the ref

Sick
The only thing i dont like about mike is his arrogance
That's  Mike  ! 👍
Mike is such a genuine, humble person.
Mike did that alot .. As a referee they'd have to get into his field of vision to get his attention otherwise he's in there, right close throwing those bombs.
https://youtu.be/eqmLW43UP98
https://youtube.com/shorts/uYa7-IUM_4k?feature=share
I would have to think Tyson did not like this guy
I feel him that’s me too
Anyone been in this situation with their dog? Let it go an realize you fucked up lol!! 🤣🤣  Looks like Mike was just frustrated that this simple Gazelle wanted to play with the lion pack. He was just getting a reminder of who is is and isnt. 🤣 a damn good 1 at that.
his whole career will be remembered with an ear bite
The words that these people come out with zoned where are you going with zoned out am I supposed to agree with that label . I would like for you to stop talking about Mike  with those title of Zoned out it's a small world I would advise you to completely stop using those undermining statements. I strongly advise you to stop the passive comment's .
I thought the time he actually lost control was really when he literally was biting a ear off
Giant Stingray Fish cutting and cooking https://youtu.be/lE-Q0yNNASs
He should've gotten a disqualification for pushing the referee.
Was there a reason for him to lose control? Did the other opponent shit talk him or was it just Tyson in a mode and couldn't get out?
Love 💕😘💕💕😘
The bad man
Jesus Christ saves from sin. Romans 3: 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Hebrews 9: 27  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: Isaiah 64: 6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. Revelation 21: 8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. Romans 5: 8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. John 3: 16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 14: 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. Romans 10: 9-10.  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Jesus said John 5: 24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. 1John 5: 10-13 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. Ephesians 2: 8-9  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Romans 8: 1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 1 Corinthians 15: 3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 2 Corinthians 5: 21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.. ;.........................................................
Why wasn't Tyson fined for his blatant disrespect to the ref. I guess if you're black the rules don't apply to you
Damn dude Mike used to see RED FOR REAL .. HOLY SHIT
ALI might be the goat in terms of achievements when it comes to boxing, but when it comes to the most feared boxer, mike Tyson is and always will hold that title. The man was savage and out of this world.
Yeah I remember that, but for Mike that’s called Saturday.

Mike was something else
Sounds like street fight rules instead of boxing knockout rules.
This is why I think that Tyson was a street fighter
That was a close one, I almost lost an ear in that battle.
I can't wait to see Mike Tyson fight again he's going to knock the shit out of Paul
Drugs are a hell of a thing son
You imagine him in MMA and  kickboxing 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤜🤛 Mike you are my inspiration 🤘🤘🤘✊🇵🇷
I think this is the fight when he had gonorrhea
All those roids
Prime Mike was the best ever! Period!
You mean *coked out
Wym legit stop it the ref seems legit enough to me hahahaha
"two giant heavyweight fighters fight" :Sends a smaller referee to officiate the fight
Mike Tyson is like blaster without the master.  They armed a developmentally challenged man with the skills to kill people with his bare hands.
Mike = greatest boxer of our time.
"Zoned out"? More like "in the zone"!!!!
Thats true bllks men color throwing hate to whits
How can someone activate their killer instinct so much to the point that a third person right in front of you doesn't snap you out of it?
Does height really matter in a fight if your opponent is Mike tyson....
A zero iq boxing savant with emotional problems.
I love my Tyson but he should have been disqualified in that fight you can't push the referee down or hit the referee when he's breaking the fight
This was when his childhood friend got murdered by gangsters he knew.
Pointless video 👎
Tyson's is brainless.
john 3:16-18   Jesus loves you   Jesus is coming back very soon to judge this world and set up his kingdom that will reign forever and ever. Hell is real, hell wasn't made for humans but for fallen angels but if you reject Jesus and his sacrifice you will end up in hell. Whoever you worship on earth is who you will worship in the afterlife. Repent before it is too late Please i plead with you for the sake of God.
He didn’t stop the fight 🤷🏼‍♂️
Mike was dirty boxer
They should've used a taser or a cattle prod
He threw the ref away like "Hey, I'm working here!"
It's unbelievable that even after he retired we still don't get it do it he was not that's never been while he fighting and control, the untrained eye would assume that.
Now he sells weed.  hmmm I wonder if he ever smoked before fights!!
Im just wondering wtf the guy had said 😂
I love it how he said his zoned out bitch please mike is in the zone you idiot 🙄
He is the only one! The greatest!
He wasn't out of control in fact, quite the opposite. He just made very poor decisions.
Honestly this happens a lot with fighters who utilize aggression rather than control. You get in the ring and you fall into this trance that helps you hit harder and think less. The downside is that sometimes it’s hard to get out of that trance.
He didnt lose control though, Tyson was just playin extremely agressive
Mike Tyson is a legend, but not even close to Muhammed
COVID 19 IS ALL KNOWN AND ALL PLANNED FOR ECONOMIC RESET. IT WILL START OUT PROMISING ,BUT THIS IS WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS IS THE BEAST SYSTEM..NEVER  TAKE THE COVID 19 BAND AID VACCINE.......... GOD WILL MEET YOUR NEEDS, AND THE ONLY WAY TO GOD IS JESUS CHRIST. ANSWER. JESUS CHRIST.
What was the longest fight in history
Don’t be surprised when the trained killer just keeps fighting 😂
Mike fighting his demons here. Don King ruined that man's money and filled him full of drugs. He's such a humble really and so nice after he has found peace with himself. I'd like to meet Mike and have a good smoke and a talk with him.
Why are people feeling bad for him? He acted like a piece of shit human this fight
This was Tyson after losing Cus and doing time... And a suspension for biting Holyfield ear... When your the baddest man in the planet, there's nothing left to conquer but yourself... And that's exactly what he's doing!!!!
More like ZONED IN
That's that hypnosis Mike was talking about.
I WATCHED DIS FIGHT LIVE ON PPV, IT WAS KIND OF A BIG DEAL BACK THEN WEN TYSON DID DIS...I THINK DEY WERE ACTUALLY GONNA TAKE DA WIN AWAY FROM HIM BEHIND THAT LOL!
I’m honestly more impressed on how humble this man has become.
Beast mode above n beyond 💯🔥💥
i love how badass he used to and how sweet he is rn
I thought this was going to be when he bit part of a guys ear off!
Media Professionals: Raising Awareness The forum was hosted by Gary Cartwright, publishing editor of the London-based media EU Today, and Andy Vermaut, journalist and human rights advocate.   “When I started to do my research, it’s not an exaggeration to say that sometimes I had to just close my computer and walk away and take some deep breaths,” explained Cartwright in an interview. He called the organ harvesting “one of the most dehumanizing policies that I’ve ever come across.” He feels a sense of guilt that such abuse is happening “on our watch” in modern society.  Vermaut also called for more public attention to this ruthless practice. “Everybody talks about the holocaust. Everybody talks about the Rwandan genocides. But there’s not enough attention for this [organ harvesting],” he remarked.
Somewhere out there there is a kid just like Mike Tyson in his teens  or even better that we don’t know about
Is it really 32 years since the Douglas fight? Which Mike won as the ref fucked up when counting Douglas...he was down for nearly 13 seconds. I miss those early fights so much. Mike was the best and always will be. ❤️
Tysons left hook is a weapon of mass destruction
Lol this isn’t zoned out. Zoned out would be if whistles were going off and stuff and he was still fighting. But a ref getting infront of him and him throwing the ref to the ground, that’s just ghetto
Supposedly Mike was coked up before the fight
Mk ultra
da baddest man mike
Accept Jesus Christ as lord and savior today! There is no other way into heaven but through him! If you don’t accept Jesus Christ then you spend eternity in hell! Sin comes at a cost and jesus paid it! You are saved by grace through faith not of works. Make no mistake hell is forever!
Those years Lewis didn't want none of that kind of Mike Tyson till Mike was kinda laid back then Lewis did the challenge. 😁
Rounds. Nothing elce.
Did he still win
Being in the “zone” you are literally hyper focused and all your senses are focused on one particular action.

Mike wasn't zoned out,  he was trying to kill'em
he wasnt zoned out he was stoned
He bugged out and thought he was fighting Don King.
one day it's an ear next day it's a ref, so entertaining 😍
I think the video was too long
That's the definition of seeing red.
Old boy didn't realize what was about to happen to him
Mike is such a genuine, humble person.
Tyson is definently one of the most ego fighter I know. He would do anything to win including biting

Hypnotized
Mans steps into the ring fighting his own demons often losing himself in the process. Mentality of a broken man.

MICHEAL JACKSON IS STILL ALIVE ARCHIVE THIS BEFORE THEY DELETE https://youtube.com/shorts/oy4tg1Nqu0g?feature=share
I was like this one time in school
Mike was high off marijuana I remember watch a documentary on it lmao
Zoned out? Coked up is more like it.
Zoned out=coked out of his mind And just to be clear, Tyson was an amazing boxer, one of if not the best. And he’s an even better man than he is a boxer. I’m not baiting on him at all! Just joking around.
I was at that fight in Scotland. Paid £200 for a fight that lasted afew seconds. Lol
No zone out but zoning IN 🤣🤣🤣
I love how this footage was 21 years ago and this video is on the 5th trending
You are the baddest person.

Mike is humble now because he has come to terms with all the sacrifices and wicked shit he had to do and endure for fame..
Fighting his demons
ʜᴇ ɪs ɪɴ ʜɪs ᴢᴏɴᴇ.
Wow that was wild
What led him to doing that? Did his opponent irritate him? Drugs?
Cocaine is a hell of a drug
Coked out, I meant zoned out🤫
It's called cocaine
HALOTESTIN
This fake axx career and scripted matches smh that's why he said he's a piece of issssh and those belt meant nothing
Tyson the base for the Simpsons character fictional boxer Dredrick Tatum
The drums of war were to loud that night
That's why we don't piss off kind people

Wooowww!! That’s crazy. Mad aggressive🔥🔥🔥 I’m trying to get my subscribers up too💯keep it up❤️
Zoned out. Good excuse  If he would have fouled Joe Louis or anything ,Joe would take him out. Louis's cornermen would have beat hell out of that mouthy prick.
Got to give credit to his corner men to get him to stop 👍👍👍👍👍
I bet that guy said something that pissed Tyson off
Waiting for the kind hearted person who can actually Support me from this heart and understand my problem❤ THANKS
'C svc vvvvv
He shoulda been disqualified right there
And the fuckin you tube guy wants to fight him
But ref it was supposed to be a 12 punch combo..
Tyson.. ahhh.. my era!! Gotta love it
Mike is still my Fav of all time
That guy had no business to be fighting Mike.
Imagine if the referee was Yamasaki 💀💀
Mike was like I will kill him
Tysons bobbing left hook was deadly
Tyson was a madman in his prime
Kill kill killl that’s all he was thinking
Watching Tyson in his prime is so entertaining. He is a badass m-fer.
Zoned in, surely ?
I'm honestly more impressed at how humble this man has become.
Now we learn how he fights... In the ring he doesn't see an opponent he sees an enemy... And he wants to destroy that enemy...
Mike was a savage in there. You could see once he saw his corner man in there he snapped out of it. Poor mike, man really had a fucked life in those days glad he’s much better now and can articulate what it was like in those days and how that rage had control of him.
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos 🎈
Goat!
When you in that zone you ain't worried about anything.
Mike said he did coke before that fight
He looked high
*Abella Danger*
The referee nut cases that make these referees decisions to be in the ring with particular kinds of fighters should be made a little more carefully when they have fighters with certain strength personalities attitude mentality reputation they should put the proper size ref in there stop making stupid judgment calls and make sure that they're capable of no matter who's in the ring they can do their jobs without any complications don't put an old small ref with violent large competitors your judgment is poorly received makes us wonder if you can really referee
Ali was his idol. He use Ali as leader of what he become.  I think.
This is the Tyson I would have loved to see him beat Douglas with
Substitute zoned out with, corner took him off his meds!
seems like they weren't testing for H bombs back then
I am very unwilling  to awaken the British dreams! Mass immunization program! The reinfection rate of Omicron was 7%! omicron second infection rate is 7%!
Zoned in,not zoned out.
Hi
https://youtu.be/vUDZoBOLuWE
zoned out? no.... that wasn't Iron Mike zoned out... that was just the old careless weakness Mike tyson...  hes a new person now. a real G
That’s the key to anything in life to get zone out and focus on only that thing and not anything distract you
I'm pretty sure
mike likes to hurt people thats the only reason, it excites him
haha he said f that to the ref
😆
Savage beast mode 💪🏾
"zoned out" I call BS.... He's a thug who'd he in jail if he wasn't famous.
That's what drugs does to you.... Don't hate, Tyson makes clear on the hard drug history
His opponent was probably talking shit about him before the match
He was gonna kill him
drama
if someone other did this the comment section would look so much different
Mike Tyson is overrated!!
He needs to come back to Indiana or he don’t like Indiana? Hahaha
Nice
Cocaine mike
Prolly on mushrooms lol
Tomato cans. Baddest?
Once iron mike is in the zone, you best get the hell outta there!🤣
He wasn't "Zoned out" at all...Iron Mike was FOCUSED!!
Daily Reminder To Stay Hydrated & Drink Water
Mike has always had issues
He's Zoned out???He's nothing but a coward
Mike : i didn't hear you said stop  bruhh just be honest that you want to k!ll that guy 💀💀
He just wanted to finish the fight.
When you're in the battle it's hard to just turn that switch off
He just wanted to hurt the white boy.
Mike said of himself the evil guy enters the ring and he didn't like that guy.
you mean zoned in?
He was hungry and saw ears and went crazier then he already is. If mike sees this my ex wife melissa  the bat bowman  wrote and posted this and she can be found at 7394 Eastwood Ave Los Angeles ca
Zonned out 😂🤣😅😂🤣😅😂🤣😅😂🤣😅
Zoned out?  ... I doubt it
The fight was over for me
🔥🌊🐬💦💧 FIREWATER EVERYTHING!
Its not zoned out. Its zoned in. Zoned out would be daydreaming or something.
and jake paul wants to fight tyson lmfao
Beast
Should of been DQ for that
Mike smash
The coke took over
I can't understand why you're all proud of this sh*t he did
Unpopular opinion: I despite Tyson
Should of been a loss.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHSW80loq4E&t=226s
In the ring with a "zoned out" Mike Tyson.....pass
Only Tyson himself can answer why he reacted like that .did he ever said why.
Must have owed him some money!
Tyson knew what he was doing....the idiot just wanted to keep hitting the guy.. didn't have nothing to do with his corner man....give me a break.....jerk
"Literally come, inside the ring."
Damn
When mike lose control you lose a ear bro
If a fighter now days do this all internet would have been ruttles with him , but when it s mile tyson it s cool , my opinion best hevyweight but the must dum ever olso
He wasn't zoned out
Mike: doesn't stop fighting even if the referee stopped the fight "He's zoned out"  Someone: does the same thing  "No sportsmanship"
Iron mike , nice one there .
Great work 😎
Zoned out? .... nah
He should have been disqualified
Should have been disqualified
Kill mode activated
This is what makes Ali always much greater than Tyson, Ali stopped the fight between Jerry quarry in 7th round when he saw Jerry is defenceless.
It was the shrooms! That's money dude!
Mike was a different breed 😭😭😭😭
None of us are good, nobody is better than anybody else, we are all sinners who by God’s free gift of salvation by dying on the cross for us, freed us from the pains of hell, and the human fear of death. Come to the LORD Jesus Christ, he will always love you, he will never neglect you. Come to him before it’s too late. ‘’For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life’’ John 3:16. Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done (it’s not based on our performance) so none of us can boast about it. Ephesians 2:9 It is only through the grace of God are ye saved. So accept God’s Mercy repent for all of your sins, aloud to the Lord Almighty Christ Jesus, cry aloud that Jesus Christ is God, who was crucified and was raised on the third day. forsaking your sins and trusting in the rich blessings of his grace. ‘’for it is by faith that purity's us from all sin, faith in the living God Christ Jesus’’
He wasn't only the baddest man on the planet he was the scariest man on the planet
Tyson is probably the most performance drug abuser of all time
Mike at the beginning amazing mike in the middle unwatchable mike now Fkn unbelievable. Belts still there for his taking.
Overrated boxer
Boxing is not a sport all of you entertained by this fucked up shit
Tyson was a D Head when he was in his prime!
At the end he was like "wtf, it's over?" After beating the shit out of his opponent and when he stopped and looked away, he didn't even notice the punches from his opponent ;D
He wasn't zoned out.. he was just up to his usual antics.
I'm honestly more impressed at how humble this man has become.
but none of them dared to attack mike and start a mass brawl like many do today 🤣🤣
Yet Mike was declared victorious .
To be fair refs have allways been so scared of mike tyson killing his opponents so they would leggit pull him off like not even after his first 3 punches
The Cokeinator
Tek Motivasyon 👍👍👍💪💪💪
Tasmania Devil
Mike Tyson has chopped down many Giants........Logan Paul is doomed....💯😔🙏
They butchered Lou’s name :( I used to train with Lou in queens NY. Great guy! Seems like Mike didn’t want Lou to get that easy check
https://youtu.be/zl4Lx94q6mE
No Mike was not zoned out. He knew exactly what he was doing. He was putting on a show. An Extra Bonus Show.
Y2K really changed this man
N that ladies n gents is called "Beast Mode"
We’re there any repercussions for this? Seems illegal to keep punching after the fights over lol
Must’ve been personal he’s like the mj of boxing
If problems was a person
Get right with the lord Jesus Christ before it’s too late repent and put ur faith in Christ. Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins and risen on the third day he’s the only way to salvation John 14:6 John 3:36 John 3:16 Romans 10:9…
Refree was tougher then the Tyson opponent
Mike is not that guy anymore.
did u know trump is rich! if u want revenge trump!  let's make rich tax!
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life8
That punch was fast in slow motion
Mike was like… I didn’t hear no bell 🛎
Coked up more like
He went into the ring with the intention of killing ! That's some Tiger level trance focus form the baddest man focused on his prey
mike tyson isnt just gonna fight you… he is gonna try to kill you
Mike  can't control becuz he always used drugs 💉 steroid💉💪 in every of his fight
He almost lost that if the ref said he wouldn’t listen to Cale
Of course a black man that did crack and has trauma would be entertaining to whit people
Ole Lou got the last 2 taps in.
Another tomato 🥫
Dont not judge mike tyson as a badest man. Judgging to you fellow is also a badest doing.
Ref should not have stopped the bout.. the opponent was still fighting. Bad call.
Don't fuck with Mike Tyson
Mike tyson🤣🤣🤣
you edited the video into vertical video wow way to pander to idiots on phones
He was pissed n this guy got his fury
tbh he hated this part of him where he goes berserk
Shouldn't be talking all that shit
Bro almost caught a body
This the tyson he was talking about he’s afraid of huh !
He musta jus saw the rocky when Apollo gt killed
You paid a lot of money for this to be promoted lmaoo
I met Mike  at sky Harbor airport in Phoenix Arizona The nicest man I have ever met!!
What a bad example to younf people
He knew he just mad like he used to always be mike wasn't always a nice dude just is what is great guy now he was young and mad .
"I think sometimes we forget that, THAT'S mike tyson!"
I’d say he was so zoned in.
Boxing a very dangerous sport only brings the anger hate out of them  Sad
He wasn't zoned out he was on coke
MY TOP ANIME OPENING OF 2017 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVuUEOaqONg&ab_channel=Kurowolf
Mike was like , you make me train waste my time for this ????
I remember that mike. That was the scary one
“You said thtop? Itth over?”
Tyson is a beast.
You can’t lose control if you never had it
Mike was dangerous in his prime 😳
That camera straight down seeing his punch fast and quick unbelievable I guess that's why they call him toughest man on the planet
The man was a beast nothing stood in his way. Hunger is one thing the survival Instinct is stronger and he was fighting for survival.
Baddest?
Tyson should have been imprisoned.
If i remember this right, i think he lost someone
Mike Tyson aint have no mind.  Pure fighter.
Mike was fighting a lot of demons he’s always been a great person but the older he got the more the real Tyson came out
Lmao all those kids doesnt know that he used cocaine in this fight
Wtf is that, he wasn’t “zoned out”. He should have been disqualified.
Wasn't he coked out in this fight lol?
Mike Tyson is a GOAT!
#3 on trending?
Mike Tyson CIA training....  KILL KILL KILL KILLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Tht's why he hates himself when became a fighter
Dirtiest boxer myke tyson
Cocaine is a hell of a drug
Tyson was a thug and still is, you couldn't wipe class on this guy, if you had it on a rag !
If thats not a killer instinct then I dont know what is. Tyson was and still is a killer.
He was actually high on crack
Im cringing because Its pronounced SAVA REESY****
Black out moment
Pp
You worship boxing celebrities and glorify everything they do and trash anyone who opposes them.
No one wants to say it, but this is a clear case of how bias people are for celebs with Star Power. What other boxer can do something like this and not get disqualified and stripped of their win? The ref was about to STOP the fight due to the fighter being defenseless and this guy is hitting him after the call.
When “I blacked out” really happened.
These men are trained to fight and get in the zone...what do u expect??
It was just a roid rage. Now that he is no longer on them, he has calmed down.
Not zoned out more like zoned the fuck in 💯
He needs to finish the job ,
He’s not human he gets in that fight or flight mode which always fight when we’re talking bout Tyson n he turns in to a real life BEAST but thats y he is probably the most feared boxer Ever
Idiotic
WHAT THAY TRYNA SAY HE WAS ON COKE OR SOMETHIN?.
Mike was tired of his fights ending so early that’s why he decided to let all the training out
Thats when he used his fist , at the end of the 90' he used his teeth lol
I was actually at that fight, Lou took a dive , sciffed his head
Nearly every video about mike Tyson: „when mike tyson lost control.“ pepped with a nice bada** thumbnail of him. Lol
I love Mike..he's the man...Sinatra sang a song..my way..and Mike did it his way..
Mike is a douchebag, let's admit that. Who promotes him as a good guy? He isn't a good guy at all
"Zoned out" is a nice way to.say it
He was a savage. Way better than Mayweather
I’m sure Shabba Raisin got paid well
Don't do drugs
Why is this #3 on trending
This is side effects of years of hypnotism
Mike wasn't kidding when said he wanted to kill em lmao. *murder/death/kill*
Yeahhh, mike had a lot on his mind that day😩🤣
, very nice florid 👍
Wish I could time travel and bring Tyson into present day UFC. He would've been a problem as a cage fighter .
Zoned out...really? No he was a moron.
Tyson did that and all of his fights
Mike Tyson is in his prime was so entertaining to watch because you never knew what was going to happen lol.
Lou Savarese was still punching Mike Tyson at the end. Mike wanted to END the fight, not have it stopped.
This is the “Beast” he always talks about during his interviews.
Louie from the town I grew up in Greenwood Lake New York
The people that love Floyd 🌈weather will say Tyson would have lost because he didn't hug, hold and run and doesn't know the sweet science of boxing.
That ref was really trying to safe the guys life, because could you imagine the balls you would need to try and get between Mike Tyson in that mental state
Mike Tyson fought trash opponents
Damn
No bell = in hell
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus
SAVAGE
My favourite one is when he walked towards Lennox in the press conference trying to intimidate him and Lennox just punched him the face.
zoned in*
Spinal
Logan Paul I can beat Mike Tyson. Also Logan Paul, why is this old man still punching me!?!
He only stop because he was in hold
👃❄️
The refferiea purpose is to stop fighters when it gets too serious  someone could suffer from this  This shows how mike tyson didn't care about his opponents and his refferiea safety because he was too in the zone
Mike is, was, and always will be a beast. Love u Mike.
Pit Bull
If a person who has this kind of rage and inner demons change and be this amazing humble person, what are some of us.
Let's Go Brandon 👏 👏 👏 👏
Tyson said hypnotized before every fight as a teenager maybe he was hypnotized for all his fights
Cocaine is hell of a drug
Mike went from the baddest man on the planet to the most humble man in the world
Dude was a heavy weight punching bag, that's about it
https://youtube.com/shorts/kYG282WQd2E?feature=share
Mike has come a long way compared to how he used to be.
Whats next
Mike was like… I didn’t hear no bell 🛎
You call it “zoned out?” I call it disregarding the rules of boxing! He should have been fined.
Dude hit tyson in the back of the head.. Dude got mad
He wasn't "zoned out" he was coked up. He has long since admitted that. Let's go Crime in Sports! (Great podcast that did 3 episodes on Mike)
Corner man had to do what in the ring?? 😳
Mike Tyson : PEACE WAS NEVER AN OPTION
He just don’t like the man he becomes in the ring.  He’s said thst not how he lived he just grew up
He's a beast
Holyfield struggled against savarese
You mean zoned in..
💪🏽the of the greatest alive
Baddest or worst
He was high 😂😂😂
Lou was my coach as a kid mad love ❤️ and respect to him he actually is a great man ❤️ Houston tx main st boxing 🥊 iykyk
He was on that bag That cocaine
Not Pepsi but...
Mike said " I wathent finished yet"
That's how you fight.. fight to kill.
Mike was like a pitbull
The time was never over it was still going?
It was all the drugs he was on
Tyson was a very unprofessional boxer.  Now he's just a big teary eyed guy.  Weeps like a little girl on all of these podcasts
Never fight with emotions!!  Except when it’s a bum and you are an entertainer!!!
Its amazing that Tyson was never banned from the sport... The only reason they never did, was Tyson was too good and was too big of a money maker
That was fake fight....tyson did that to make it look real...blind ppl
Zoned out? Your becoming as bad as cnn on reporting
He WaS fIghtinG dEmONs. Bruh
Dude should have stayed down 😆😆😆
He didn’t zone out, he was pissed and wanted to “kill” the guy, it was no accident or “ oops I didn’t notice the ref between us doing his all to separate us”
Everyone says Muhammad Ali was the greatest. I honestly see mike wrecking Ali by the end of the first round. A few solid connections with those canned hams. It would be over without a doubt.
better than getting your ear chewed.
Why wasn’t he DQ’d
I'm so amazed at the MAN Mike has become. He doesnt let his past dictate his future.  He got away from all those snakes and that fkd up entourage. I'm so happy for Him now👑💯❤💪🏿
One thing about Mike you had to love is he always wanted to fight more even when the fight was over. He’d be upset when he’d knockout someone in the first round.
When Savaraze grabbed him by the back of the head I'd keep swinging too..
Imagine fighting mike Tyson back in those days. It must have felt like fighting every demon from hell at the same time...
Shiuld be disqualified
Baddest man? Rather best boxer.
You never know what a man is going through
Sa-Va-Reese Three syllables
“Zoned out”. More like drugged out
Beast and legend.
Stfu stop trying bring this man back
Stop Mike Tyson.......naaaa il let him come back in the zone
I'm honestly more impressed at how humble this man has become.
I wonder how was the trash talk from ok boy...hey Tyson I'm coming in to show the world that I can stop you and become the world champion.. I'll see you in the ring..
Tyson wanted to keep fighting.#PITBULL.
When Tyson left home at the age of 12, he told his father "You're the man of the houth now"
Its a blood sport, kill or be killed and tyson wanted blood 🤣
Mike Tyson  be smashing everybody
A real man to admire
Who cares about Tyson
How comes when unknown fighters do dirty fights you make it look like they are bad but if a well known fighter does it he was "zoned out"
LOL!!!  😎
You can see the confusion on his face.
Difference between alli and other boxers
Ooo! I can't wait for uncle Mile to start swinging on Logan Paul!
My man mike tyson
Tyson looks so much smaller than him. Tyson still blew him away in the first round.
That’s those mushrooms
They saved that mans life
He should have been disqualified!
I love Tyson.but what he did here was pure showing up!!!🤷
And there wwe refs are always sleeps when superstar touches them
If I don't kill him, it don't count! - iron Mike Tyson
Cocaine is a hell of a drug.
Like bulldog
Teach the kids well.  Look at Tyson' s opponent.  Can't blame Tyson. He was just doing what he was trained to do
Tyson owns the ring.
Lennox made him pay for that behaviour
He had a horrible life back then, he was fighting his own demons.
Jus happens when u in the zone 💪
Do referee take life insurance cover for tyson fights
Damn mike
The BOUT
💗👍👍
Was there a reason for him to lose control? Did the other opponent shit talk him or was it just Tyson in a mode and couldn't get out?
Mike was a savage in there. You could see once he saw his corner man in there he snapped out of it. Poor mike, man really had a fucked life in those days glad he’s much better now and can articulate what it was like in those days and how that rage had control of him.
Tyson was a madman. "My style is impectuous, my defence is impregnable, I wanna eat his children." One of the maddest post fight comments ever
