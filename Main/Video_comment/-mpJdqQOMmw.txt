You was my favorite rapper
Buddy
Takeoff noooo
RIL.... So tragic. Such a young life taken. It's not just that people lose u at that age, but they lose the potential of what u could've been and could've experienced. Just heartbreaking
Sad
My hope is that the trigger MAN or trigger MEN are prosecuted, charged and sentenced to the MAXIMUM the fullest extent of the LAW!! Cause there was no need for an innocent man to be lying in the casket lifeless and not breathing!!!It's honestly a doggone down right shame that what little love was left  in the BLACK community has long gone died and was buried in the ground 😭 along with Dr King's the only black man in the world who ever cared about the well being of others why the HELL are y'all packing GUNS and amunition to what was supposed to have been a BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION????
Not Advocating violence BUT YO ATL I KNOW Y'ALL GOT THIS💪
It was family I'm broken him and Arron Carter why why I can't take this volace anymore I'm fuckin broken .
So sorry.
….
A video tweet really cardi had so much to say during pnb rock situation
Clickbait Carly never said anything
R.i.p. TakeOff🙏🏿❤️😇👑💯
Illuminati at their best 😒😤🤧
Rip Takeoff 🙏 Praying for the family 🙏
People don’t know man, he didn’t deserve to die so soon. The amount of love and talent he had was priceless. Yeah, we may not have known him like his folks but he’ll surely be missed. I still can’t believe it. Rest in Peace and Paradise, King.
I'm sorry but I think Cardi B tribute to takeoff was bs and it should have came from her ❤️ not a clip of a special moment he shared about his mom ring and also think offset tribute was bs too just posting his pic on his page....Takeoff definitely should have meant more to them than just subtle post. The ppl want to hear your hearts especially fans during this time not that fake sht. Rest in Peace to Takeoff and may God send heavy comfort to his family and real friends.
😢
No one is safe from the click bait....NO ONE
RIP❤
Huh 🤔 tired of fake thumbnails... y'all need to stop that immature crap... smh...🤬🤬🤬
ILLUMINATI SALVE . PIG
man R.I.P Takeoff
I get somebody died and everything but I mean come on. They were dumb people doing dumb stuff that ended badly
😂👇🔥🐒🔥
Black on black crime is the highest crime rate
I'm sorry,, and condolences,, but did this guy sing anything about shooting deaths of young children? Way too many innocent victims,, no songs about that,..adults are on their own,,,
If you got killed today , not one celebrity would give a damn …. Let that sink in
Thot words don't matter
Could give 💩💩s
Nobody CARES!!!
This is just painful 😣
Clickbait is the ultimate disrespect you can do in a situation like this.
Who tf is Takeoff?🤔🧐🤷‍♂️💩💩💩🤦‍♂️🤡👎
Tbh. F*** everyone who being disrespectful most of y’all sit on yall ass all day and aint doing nothing with your lives. Atleast he did something with his life and atleast he wasnt in a bunch of drama like most rappers. So some of yall disrespectful a** people need to stfu.
The world is lost without God. Until all of us turn away from our wicked ways, the list will go on and on. Prayers for better days for all of us.  Amen
Forever legend💯
Rest in peace my condolence to the family and friends I am so sorry
My family and and I send our love and prayers to the family.God give them peace and comfort during this time.
How did he die and rp!
Another black man dead at the hands of another.  The freaking beat continues.   As sad as this is...they had no business at that party...all of this childish Halloween BS...grown folks dressing in costumes is ridiculous.  This boy is dead.  His family is grieving.  Why???  Because niggas still think they can be rich and pull-up in the hood.  RAP music is inmate bounce...guns and death  will always follow it.
🙏🏾🙏🏾
He Gon Live 4ver in Christ Jesus. R.I.P Take. 💯
I’m so sorry for your loss Cardi B prayers for you and your family. God will get you through it the hearts of many are growing cold. We are living in end times it is so sad to see such a man that had so much potential that God would’ve used while alive. Time is short y’all frame and fortune isn’t worth it. The rapture and Great tribulation is coming I want to say I love you all and I hope you guys repent and come to Christ, he loves you so much and wants to help you and be your God and fellowship with him just trust him. He was so young and it’s sad ti see him pass I’m so sorry
John 3:16-17 “For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God did not send his son into the world to condemn it, but that the world through him might be saved.”
I love you too
I love you And I am tried of this police officer son.

We all Die.although some way to soon...rip...
I'm sorry he died But Cardi B's reaction is insignificant and will not bring him back.  Having a video of her reaction is stupid and pointless
I love my son everyday this is so sad I only have one rip
See you soon  each other   .. have faith love hope
I don't believe it 🤍we study on social media
How is Cardi b reacting to this sad news news?
Means nothing, she help demonize "black" men. They all will pay...
Rap is gay weak now. Reply me with your address rappers. Ill come pick u up 😈
I hope they find who did this 😢 so sad
Who and who ? Oh right Nobody of consequence
Repent now because you don't know for later. 2 Peter 3:9  New International Version  9 The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise,(A) as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient(B) with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.(C)
Word on the street is he “ craped out” getit😅
Her and offset having to explain to their little girl Kulture that hes not coming back.... That's so sad.
Cardi B is fake as hell
Survival of the fittest
This why I keep saying being a rapper is pointless no matter how good of a rapper there's always people waiting to kill you or just hate on you. Everyone says being a rapper is good nah it's not safe. Heck rappers rob each other crews robbing crews fans robbing other rappers. Another innocent person taken away from us cause people can't handle trash 🗑️ talking like adults everyone acting like children. My condolences go out to take off and his family.
RIH 🙏🏾🦋💙😪 I pray 🙏🏾 GOD'S PEACE AND COMFORT FOR HIS MOTHER , FAMILY  AND FRIENDS 🙏🏾🦋💙😪
Rip Takeoff
I didnt heard cardi b say nothing and she didnt say nothing yet why you all bloggers saying this one say this and that one say that plz .you all just want views
Damn, feel bad for him but wish I could say Migos where good. They're no tho lmao
No loss here
That s*** was a setup from the start$$$ rest in peace homie you got caught slipping
🤦‍♀️y'all need validation from cardi b 😂
He had a whole life ahead of him so young to go so soon SMH rip bro
BLM~ Yea right
Who give a shit?
I can't believe it brooooo..😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
These rappers bravado has reached a certain point. We have millionaires, dying outside like they sell dogfood, and real animals....  It's a clear difference between: have gots & have nots ( mofos crashing out, being around certain circles)
Wow, these artists are dropping! Condolences to his family, friends, and fans
BLACK PEOPLE NEED TO DO BETTER AND STOP MAKING EXCUSES
Black people killing black people
I'm truly hurt like I knew him I always rewind his parts because he be rapping for real. Rest in paradise King
Canada we love all of you
I know none of them nor I care for rap artists
This hasn't anything to do with his death .poor Rapper.but her clothes two carved out holes about breast.if they can Show there parts they want to announce It showsiterally they Don't want you to see Famously What's upstairs usually a vacant Autoplayis running .
Plot twist: Quavo set his nephew up
Rappers that promote violence and crime in the black community should be boycotted.
Black men need to stop killing each other
I hated their music, but in terms of life dude was a baby. And it makes me sad that with the amount of fame and wealth this man had he still wasn't safe! So what does that mean for the average black man trying to navigate this Earthly hell!?
Statement just a video???
wow so relevant
It's so sad takeoff had to go. I wish the rest of migos also got shot. That way takeoff wouldn't be alone in afterlife. RIP, may Jesus guide you
Gone way too soon, 28 years Young such a tragic incident, and to think that people actually thought that the other members of Migos had something to do with it was absolutely disrespectful they lost a brother
Rip
This is so sad breaks my heart we losing to many people 😢 Mothers and fathers are hurting and it’s sick
My deepest sincere condolences to his family and friends.  Rest In Peace
So cardi b basically did as little as y’all did and if takeoff would’ve put just an ounce more effort into being positive instead of a bad influence saying to cook drugs and do violent crimes like robberies this would actually have an effect but it’s whatever because it’s migos ready to see em go along with cardi
Not sure who this person is, but add him to the list of unknown rappers with dumb names thats been killed.  Happens every 3 or 4 weeks.  You'd think they'd smarten up, create a stage name like Paul and keep their nose down.
What dumbasses do
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm.......
Who?
Takeoff? Kind of name is that? Rest in piss lol
Can't speak on the dead. But I can still speak on queef0 and dip $h!+.
Legends never die ❤
RIP, Takeoff. 😭
Damn them white supremacist
Even looking at cardi b, you can just tell there is nothing going on in that head. The hamster has stopped running in that wheel a long time ago
Oh well , no big loss , ya can't spell crap without rap
Too bad it wasn't her
I remember when they was retweeting everybody who said something bout they sing trap house jumping like Jordan. They came a longggg way, RIP Takeoff man.
Sad 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Homie flow was the illest of the three....R.I.P
R.I.P Takeoff🙏🙏🙏
Yall listen cherish your life and enjoy your moments be humble even with the fame just like take off was and stop looking for a moment to go viral by posting this man's body u dont know him we just know his music let his family heal in peace and stop speaking on shit you don't know about
R.I.p baby smh
"A gente vive se matando irmão, por quê? Não me olhe assim, eu sou igual a você" Racionais Mc's
Rip TAKEOFF, bury him with his ring that he absolutely obviously adored , the one with him and his momma.
So sad the ring I know his mom is having it really bad
RIP TakeOff😥 Prayers to the Family ,friends, & fans
I really can't stop crying when I see these videos of him I have been a Migos fan for 8yrs and now who's gonna rap for me 😭😭😭
Why the click bait. Where's cardi reaction?
Rappers should stop praising illuminati and all that staff,Satan loves nobody. RIP bro 🙏🏾
Rest in heaven 🙏
Dam… when y’all turned takeoff picture to black and white at the end… that hit me . 😪
Takeoff is in heaven he was a great person he never had any bad publicity he never had to disrespect others to make a great song i love you man god bless you and your family
😭😭😭😭😭🙃
❤🙏🏽🕊️
Nothing good got lost
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Takeoff rip
This  brings  back  memories  to  me  on  the  day  that  my  oldest  son  was  murdered
And they still gone rap  about kill, shoot ops drill kill this nigga shoot kill bang... it’s so disgusting at this point... I dont
if she can’t post a tribute on her very active IG then we don’t care
Weird how it’s barely even on the news of pops up on my feed
Such a tragic situation man! I hope and pray Quavo & Offset come together and settle their differences!!! It’s gonna hurt them both😢
💔😭
Rip takeoff. No matter how many people In the comments will be disrespectful. The actual kind people on this world will remember you as another human being that should not have had his life taken.
😪😪😪😪😪😪😪
They are all alive take off is alive playing a different character this world is a stage
I can’t understand why the rap and gangsta culture is based around taking strong, talented, influential black men out of the equation. Self suppression at its finest. Rip to takeoff and blessings to his family.
Watching this makes you want to 😢
rip...people wake up..its demons time
She really only speak on Dominicans and stuff fr fr .
Oh Cardi feels some type of way about it? That’s cute, I guess violence should be celebrated when it’s towards people we don’t like.. Interesting
Y’all are lame for trying to monetize off peoples grief.
