Here is some Big Big BIG love to you Madame J !   SMMMMOOOOOOTCh !
❤❤😮❤
GREAT!!!  ❤❤ you should sing R&B more often. 👌💯
The video I didn't know I needed until I saw it and it is a 100% appreciated and it made my day. Thank you, Jesse J for being outstanding.
Still naturally beautiful
Love her voice. She’s untouchable!!
Her bedroom is bigger, audio quality is worse 😂
Her humour and the comedy in this perfectly reminds myself why Jessie has been my absolute favourite artist since I was 11. And I’m 23 next month. True heartbeat right here. Still patiently waiting for Album 5 😂🫶🏻
had me smiling from ear to ear da whole time <3 love u jessie.
The older version of her looks like the younger… crazy
c'mon Jessie, why haven't you suggested moving in with me here in Arizona? You really are just a "brat" then, Love ya . . . none the less, Your still a babe!
This was the video I discovered you on...can't believe it was 12 years ago 🤯
The sound was all over the place but I love your voice.👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Okay ✅
OMG I seriously doubt that you will ever see this comment... But this is the best!!! Most funny and creative thing I've ever seen on YouTube from an artist as big and as extravagant as you! Your humor just adds so much to why I love you as an artist it's 2023 and I'm still rocking with you I love you so much! One of your biggest fans Alyssa
COOL VIDEO
12 years later and she didnt age at all. I wish i was lucky like that. ❤

ICONIC!!!!
This is real wow
Her vibrato is now much more interruptive in the delivery of the melody, but it’s great to see her humour looking back on her younger self. Great vocals, loved the raw talent of Jessie then and now ❤️
Love❤

Crazy what you did !!!!!! Waaaaaaa ! Importance to keep the crazy flame 🔥 shining In us!! Blessings 🙌 May Allah gives you more present n future 🙏 love ❤️ is so high multidimensional ..keep physical activities never stop never give it up...discipline is love..care is discipline
If I were in a relationship with Jessie I'd avoid an argument with her like a plague, you know what I mean right guys?  😁😜
Jessie J in my opinion one of the greatest female vocalist ever, she/you if it is you, are up there and often better than / whitney , araina( who you gave a break) Pink and christiana. You J are a legend in my book xxx
You do you so perfectly, Jessie! Bless you, darling.
Loved this!
How could you not love this lady? Full of power in her voice and so provocative!
you'd think tech has improved over 12 years to offer higher mic quality 😂. "why have you not got bedsheets on your bed" lol
She had a dream, She sticked with it, She worked on it; She realized it!  You go gal!😉 Congratulations!👍 Great example! An #Inspiration! …and a great singer!❤️
KKK
Hahahahah
A queen
How on earth is the quality of her video now so much worse, from her 12 years ago
This is so gooood! But I like your Whitney Houston covers the most! :D
Love this style song so much!
Love
correction, I'm ALWAYS asking you to sing Mamma Knows Best... probably the song I look up more for live performances
I’m in love with her beauty. ❤
🥰
How come her 12 yo mic works better than the current one 😂
You encouraging me to record a vd for me
Lol love u jess
both are perfect
So cool :)
She literally made a duet with her young self, what an Icon
There aren’t words in the English language to express how much I love this.
🤩💖💕😍
wow this is awesome it is really so bad i cant find words for it .  applause to the white major label selling donkey.  this is the definition of everything what art is not about.  this is the purest form of popmusic and capitalism.  its just disgusting and embarassing
Is there a studio version? She's awesome
Please I beg she didn't have her face worked on. I was in love with her from her "boom box" life
Only Jessie J can look EXACTLY the same and hasn't aged not one bit! In fact, she looks happier now.
awesoem! and people say time travel does not exist! )))))
Aw… love it so much
She speaks better pronounced English now.
Diva
Super Cute
I wish you could do so far away. The carol King version
1:55
And looks THE SAME!
😂😘🤗
I love them both honestly, but I love the younger Jessie J's technique or I say free spirit in terms of killing them notes ❤️💯
TAKE YOUR BAGS AND PISS OFF, COS YOU'RE NOT FOR MEEEEEEEEE NOOOOO!!!!!
SHES DOING A JERMA BIT
Amazing fucking lady, I love you aha
I like Jessy she is always beautiful, though it's old
Iloveyou so much, Jessie💛
Eu te amo muito 😍 des do começo 💞 linda
Thanks for making this, Jessie!  The original video was one of my favorites in 2009 when I was 17! Loved it then and love it now, and your voice has only gotten better!
Now people PLEASE stop covering this song!! Only Jessie needs to do her MKB cover.
Jaw come up off floor

I'll give you a hug Jessica Cornish.  If you let me I'll put my hands on your butt while hugging you, but only if you let me.  You buy the condoms.  I won't get in trouble that way.  Just joking about the condoms.  Just.  I'll give you a hug Jessica Cornish.  Come to Canberra in Australia.  I was born in Hull in the Great UK, but live in Oz with Alice.  I'll give you a hug and remind you that some people give a shit about a pop star who has a lot of money, but not always the friends she needs to stay sane and feel life is worth it.  I give a shit about you Jessie.  I'll give you a hug.  And bring some McDonalds when you show up.  Big mac. Fries.  Large.  Ok, medium.  But don't forget the big mac.  And a small coke. Babe.
SCOBY DO😅 THE BEST JESSIE J 💪
Jesus loves you 🍞😙🍞😙✨
I love thisss
Hakkınızı helal edin
Jessie J is a wonderful person
Someone changes their pfppp
“Leaving happiness for tomorrow is like waiting for the river to stop before you can cross, and you know, that river never stops.”
q buen dato te aventaste
DROPPPP A GOOD ALBUMNN!!!!  Stop giving us this extra stuff !!!!!!!
I know they say money don’t buy happiness that’s a total lie for most just wanting to get that life from away the one before just remember nobody perfect especially with relationships
Our Jessie and Morissette Amon the 2 best on the PLANET, Morissette does a great cover of this, ACAPELLA STYLE.

👍👍👍
Jessie j is the best I sing every day flashlight and price tag everyday we love you
Jessie J born 1988 (age 21) in 2009 and (age 33) in 2021
that was kinda cool.
Miss You Jessie.
We need a Jessie  and Demi collab🤩
WOW!.. Forgot how Good she was x
Woah, she was recording this when I was an INFANT, 2009. She looks older now, nice change, new look, everything! I love to see the changex)
Jessie j happens to be one of those people that look better as they age.
1:19 chill! the mic can't even take it...damn
Funny thing, first i thought te one on the right was younger bc of the quality XD still a cool video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7WFwh2FPT8&ab_channel=MiguelPovedaCanalOficial
i can't wait for the 5th album
Most powerful voice ..... amazing always loved your music
I never knew how good she is... until now

4:00 Scooby-doo XD
Some of the best ever vocals in this song
Still beautiful and a great person and singer
👏🏻 OMG 12 years I remember watching that back then ya  AWESOME  Like fine wine better with age👍🏻
You're so Cute Jessie j 😍
I had to stop the video, because I am freaking out so much. I listen to the 12 year old version all the time.  Okay, I am about to hit play and probably cry and sing my hear out.  Thanks for this.
I ❤ U
Love this!!! 😍 it’s fun to duet yourself lol I always duet myself on Smule! I love it!! You still look the same! So Beautiful Jessie! ❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🏽 God bless you!! You’re amazing!
No solo eres bella por fuera sino por dentro se nota la pasión amor hacia lo que haces tu humildad te hace mas grande saludos y un gran abrazo desde Ecuador bella talentosa dama 👍🎼🔥👏👏👏
from now on I will never throw anything away
I think she’s also filming from the same phone.
ytb suggested this video to me yesterday and i thought "yo ive seen this one 100 times already but thank you". just opened ytb and again it took me a few seconds to realize this wasn't your old video. i had to read the title and look closely to see it! you're cooler than ever! luv u jess ❤️
Got fat
Bongga 💗🤘
That video of Jessie was the time I ever saw her and I've been a fan ever since.  Brings back memories!
Fantastic
You make Adele look like a one trick pony. ( and I love Adele)
Still amazing!!!
BEST... THING... EVER 😆
Beyoncé and Jessie will never do a duet because Beyoncé knows Jessie will be the better singer with far more technique.  The only reason Jess isn’t revered as much as she should be, is because of jealousy.  She should be our vocal national treasure. The Americans always reckon they’re better than us vocally, but Jessie proves them wrong.
Happy Birthday💎💎💎
She is amazing I had my head phones on and when the music was on I took
Happy Birthday Jessie❤😘
Okay, so she's writing her 5th album?!!!!
This is weird
This is nostalgic asf and amazing !
Love This!!!
Why the 12 year old record has a better quality sound? Just curious
😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love this
She has a birthday tomorrow!!!🥳🥳🥳
Well, Jessie won't read this but I want to say I'm happy seeing her healthy. Can't wait for your new album, girl. Slay me with your amazing vocal!
Thanks so much for this, hun
This is so wholesome
Jessie you are amazing! Your such an inspiration.. and so so talented 💕
Whaaaaaaaaa
She is back 💃🥳🥳
Shame the sound quality is so off between them.
ageless queen
Criatividade tá como
As a MMA fighter... Imma create a 'sparring with myself 12 years apart video' after this 🤣
Her mic is like that cuz they had to mute the initial video as she sang over herself
Mudou nada! Mais linda, meu amor ♡
this 🥺
Jessie what the secret for not to age?
she still looks the same omg
Always sing your songs to this day - Jessie you're stellar and I adore you so much! I would be so honored if you'd hear me out and my music and give me any pointers that could help me be as strong an artist as you in the future 🥰☀️ Sending so much love always ! Stay groovy xoxo  Skelle aka Alycia
Yaaaassss this was soooo good! Good to hear your working on an album!! Love ya! 💚
Wow 12 years later and even more talented and beautiful 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Loved her then, love her now 😍
She looks the exact same pls
I dont rly know much about her besides her hits that were on the american charts but wow isnt she an international pop star? And she still kepts the same outfit without wearing it and is in what seems to be the same or sinilar apartment? And is making a youtube video? What a humble lady. Love to see it
Whrniclicked i expected the one on right to be the "old" one haha
WE LOVE YOUUUUUU
That clip was the first video I found of Jessie and my life was changed ever since. Had to sing a cover at my high school cabaret night.
hasnt aged wtf
I like how she looks at herself multiple times and  is like "gurl what are you doing!"
Yay! I like her even more! She seems so cool and down-to-earth. Respect Jessie😎❤
I'm so happy she's okay ☺️
Loooooooove you Jessie !
12 years ago Jessie was giving her so much life! 🤣  I LOVED IT!!!
I remember watching the first video back when i was 7, time flies by so fast
That was fun to watch 😍
We stan a queen 👑💖
This is fantastic, omg
You’re Iconic Jessie 😌👏🏽
This is awesome
This is iconic, it should have a million views
Wowww, that was the video that blew me away back then when I first heard of you
Hilarious

This is so awesome!
How tf is this 12 yrs apart 😳.....
I love you like the first time i saw you sing in your bedroom. It still have some much heart and pasion
Whoa
No one is on her level so she has to duet with herself 😭
Is Jessie J. okay now? I'm sorry idk.
cant see that much of a deifference... but 1:05 hurts with full turned of headset holy cow ... x)
Legend
Took her 12 years to get a rug
Jessie aged beautifully!
This is brilliant 🙏🏼😁 THANKYOU!! Xx
1:56 when younger Jessie unknowingly looks towards elder Jessie🥺
the fact that I remember seeing this very video and being completely in love with her voice 12 years ago wow
Y this so funny
Myyyyy
You are so sweet!
EP-FREAKIN’IC!!!!😆👏🏽❤️
dude I remember watching the original when I was 12. She’s still so cool
Not me thinking that she meant the song from tangled👀
Wish the mic quality wasn't so... non-existent. Beautiful Jessie J but the mic ruined the whole nostalgia. Haha.
I remember i was in middle school and listening to younger Jessie J singing mamma knows best and that's how i got obsessed with that song <3
Just loved this. Beautiful.
The face didnt changee?????? Omg this is pure legend🥶
WOW YOURE THE BEST
Gosh. The other one can really sing like Jessie. Awesome Duet!
IM GLAD IM STILL ALIVE FOR THIS
props to home girl for sticking to the same haircut for 12 years
This is great but audio is not enjoyable! 🧐
Her jaw is slimmer these days
this is amazing
PHOENIX https://youtu.be/RJ8Hrl0uqkQ 🙏👏✌️
PHOENIX https://youtu.be/RJ8Hrl0uqkQ 🙏👏✌️
PHOENIX https://youtu.be/RJ8Hrl0uqkQ 🙏👏✌️
Woah
Omg not her looking the EXACT SAME😭
12 years?? If there was no context it looks like she just reshooted 16 mins apart 😂😂
This is bloody GENIUS!
Damn I've never lived anywhere for 12 years or had the same clothes for 12 years either. That's crazy
good to know that you're doing well now ♡
참 좋은노래 중창 참 멋지게 잘부르셨습니다. 응원합니다. 반갑습니다.
12 years ago she went hard..... Now she is refined and knows the vocal tricks. Great video Great Artist. Love being a fan and lawrd I remember watching that video the first day it uploaded. I am old ...
참좋은방송 잘보고갑니다 . 응원합니다. 반갑습니다. 오늘도 즐겁고멋진 하루되세요^^^
this was an absolutely genius & heartwarming thing to have done, jessie...& it ended up stunning. i love yr lighthearted & candid conversation with you from twelve years ago as well; definitely a solid reminder to not take stuff too seriously & to keep being appreciative & always, ALWAYS smile.  PS: just wondering when yr going to start aging, that's all. also, whatever it is yr doing/using, i'm awaiting the official release of that cause dang, sis be looking the same as she did over a decade prior. 😳🙁😫(why not me as well, dear universe?) haha
this is so great and heart warming❤❤❤
I've had forgotten how FREAKIN awesome your voice is Holy sh**. God damn. 🥺😍😍😍❤️🔥
I remember that first vid and thought wow that girl is going somewhere..fast. And she did! True TALENT
Still my favourite song! Xx
My thoughts: AirPods banging against hoops
Genius
This is the collab we didn't know we needed. Love the comments in between❤️❤️
✨
Wow, you didn't age 😮
I couldn't tell apart the old vs current Jessie 😂
I remember watching this video yeeeeaaars ago! Haha! So glad you did this! Much love. ❤️❤️❤️
Couldn’t be more adorable and awesome, man that voice, it’s not like I don’t know it’s coming but still gets me every time.
WE LOVE YOU QUEEN!!!
How amazing! Goes to show we never know what the future holds :)
We didn’t ask but super glad you made & shared this masterpiece to us, we (well I) miss you! ❤︎👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Absolutely amazing
If it werent for the pants being so faded, I'd swear these videos are a day apart. She did not age at all . 🥰
Jess saying no ❤️ to her younger self with the peace signs PLEASE SKDKDKSLJDKDK
This is why I love this woman! You better sang.
um...what was going on with the sound? That being said - smashed it!
Wow
♡
Amazing!
Why. Was her 12 yo mic better than now. Lmao.
One of the few major artist that actually sound EVEN BETTER live❤😫💘😍
ICONICCCCCC
i remember when i've listen WHO YOU ARE* for the first time years ago , i've grow with you 😭💖💖  I LOVE YOU JESSIE  .MORE BLESSINGS FOR YOU 💖💖
Hello Shitshay
I remember the first time when I saw this video, I was wearing headphones and then she started to sing and hit the high notes and I almost was about to lose my hearing abilities
The thing I’m most impressed about is that she hasn’t turned that T-shirt pink yet, it’d last me 2 washes
I saw that video 12 yrs ago...I was inlove then and still inlove until now! Dang Jessie! you are a friggin Immortal!
Airpod voice quality is really shit. Mine was fine and then it deteriorated fast!
Thats sooo coooool 💞🌸
🥰❤❤👍🙌🙌🙌❤
👍👍👍
I can’t imagine being able to watch a video of myself from 12 years ago and not wanna die
💗WE LOVE YOU!😍
Damn that so good
LOVE THIS!
In the beginning I had nooo clue which was before + after!
Jessie’s singing gives me gurl wood... jus saying
You are awesome lol
I love this so much 🥺❤️
Look the exact same love you
she did not age!!!!
Amazing! Funny too! The comments section is especially  super funny 😂
Can you perform Price Tag again? 😓
You look exactly the same 12 years later lol
ICONICCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
her voice has NOT aged it's insane
"High five!! No? Ok"
Iconic behaviour - I remember watching this 12 years ago.
When I found you and absolutely fell in love with you. I shared on my Facebook and told people they were insane if they don't listen to you!! Still here
actually, this is such an amazing thing to do, seeing yourself evolve and having a living proof of that
💕💕💕
Best thing I've seen in a while 🎉 way to put a smile on people's face!
Love it
Wait I thought she was in the same room... Why did she say "can't wait to go back to UK" at the end?
🙌🏽
Lol ily
I was 11 when I first watched this!! 🤗🤗 still one of my favorite songs
The Collaboration that literally none of us saw coming. No complaints here, song STILL SLAPS HARD
Love you so much jessie❤❤❤❤💜😌
❤
This is brilliant 👌
Where can i get that prince t-shirt?
She hasn't aged a bit
ARE YOU KIDDING JESSIE??? ARE YOU KIDDING?????? YOU JUST HAD A BADASS DUET WITH YOURSELF!!!! 12 YEARS AGO!!! QUEEEEEENNNN!!!!!!
this is soo cuuuuute
Love it! 😂😘✌❤🧿
How does she still have a shirt from 12 years old. I don’t even think I have a clothing that old with me 😵
🔥🔥🔥.. she's literally blew her bedroom off
POV: You didn’t search for this
You've always been cool, haven't you?
This is so good
Jessie J can only outperform jessie j
I'm starting to believe in Vampires. And Jessie, that is your fault!!😍😍😍
iconic
Can I give this ALL my likes?  In all ways that matter, she's the same grounded person.
thats coool haha
Her voice is CRAZY UNDERRATED. She is so so so so talented
Absolutely no one Jessie J: imma duet with myself.... of 12 years ago :))))
#SaveSia
I would think the older video would have worse audio :/
Girl, your voice still sounds so healthy and there’s hardly any vocal damage at all ❤️❤️ Love this
QUUUUUEEEEEEN!
Only a Queen 👑♥️
Okay imma wait for another one in the next 12 years yeahh, see you 2033
i dont think the mic quality is bad.. she was playing the old video as she was singing so an editor probably tried to isolate her voice and remove the background song and that what made her volume low and kinda bad, unfortunately :(
This is blowing my mind that this is 12 years old I remember vibing with this video when it was first released 😍😍 now it’s full circle and you duetted yourself and I’m here vibing again 12 years later
12 year old mic was better
The fact that the pants are so faded. This was cool af!!
QUEEN👐🏽
Wowwww omg I was just watching this video the other day ❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏 Love it love you
The best part was when her old self refused to high five her present self
Obviously she's gonna have to make this a tradition now...I mean... it's too epic to just end there...
Holy shit yes the *nostalgia*
This is so fun
She literally just made to twice videos in one day, I refuse to believe this was 12 years apart...she’s a vampire..yeah she’s not human
Who hear on the ground 😅😅😂
It looks like she parted her bangs, changed her background and filmed the second clip
Love you girl kill it 💕💕💕🙏🏾
Time capsule ✨
i love her
It was part of my childhood with the song: whos laughing now.🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷I was 10 - 11 years old.
12 years have passed and nothing has changed.Her voice 🔥,her personality again 🔥....wow jessi wow👏
This is awesome! I hope you get Morissette to be part of your album too, maybe not this one, but definitely someday. She is now a big singer here in the Philippines. Your invitation for duet in your tour in Manila helped her a lot too. You are her biggest inspiration. Both talents. Keep grinding 💪🏻
Jessie is one of the best singers of our generation and she is constantly forgotten! She is an incredible vocalist, has amazing control and technique and has literally only improved over the years. She is also wildly underrated by the whole industry, but thankfully not by her fans. We love you, you superstar you!!!
❤️❤️❤️
I want more of this golden voice
Oh you blessed my heart. <3
🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤
This is an amazing video!! I've always loved the power of this song but what the h....it's wrong with her mic??? I can't hear anything from the new version....😔
Still looks the same it’s crazy
Love her💗
She literally has not aged at all
Hi Jessie, hope you’re well. Proud of you.
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾 Queen!!! Jessie knows best
made me smile! this is too epic!
love it , 12 years , still ....
More people need to do this. It’s like leaving a note to your older self. Only in this case, it’s leaving a response to your younger self. I love this concept for reflection, reminiscing, and self-growth. ♥️♥️♥️ Also good for self love.
THAT VIDEO USED TO BE ONE OF MY FAVS WHEN I WAS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL OMG I HAVE GOOSEBUMPS RN
I need 22 years later version
Just MAGNIFICENT 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I loved her befor this video.. now i love her much more
You are a genius 🥰😍 was watching this back then. Still in awe 😍 Nobody asked but we didn't know we wanted and needed that ☝🏾💪🏾
BUSSING UP, what a funny amazing vid! Well done that’s made my day Jessie!
The audio is horrible, I wish we could hear you better
Vocals are absolute bomb and I forgot what a boss she is
Wow I  still remember falling  for her voice when I heard this song, still hits  the same.
Yaaaaas
I remember when I watched this video I thought you were great and while watching this video I can say You are AMAZINNGGGGG! I LOVE U!!!
Dammmmmnnnn 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
So there are 2 more sibs from the film, what happened to monday?
She is so Iconic!
omg taking me down memory lane. so pure. love you!
Thus is proof she has stayed consistent throughout the decade! Amazing vocalist!!
Don't ever turn into a Sleeping Beauty!* Thx 4 L Princesa. 💖
Brillant !!!
Plot twist: she just went in another room & separated her bangs
her acting so nice,make me feel they not same person hahahhaha
You really have to be talented to sound that good with such awful video quality
talent
Legend
How was the sound quality better 12 years ago 🤣 I remember LOVING this video. I was an instant fan, and I still am. Crazy how time flies. Love you so much, Jessie!
i thought the left video was the 12 years ago video at first
The vid we didn t knw we needed❤❤❤❤
Brilliant!
I love you so much.
Truth: until recently, I didn't know all those different sounding songs that I liked over the last few years was actually Jessie J. Songs.  That's how I know I like a singer for her songs  and (not for her fame and social status  ).
U better run jessie
Lets appreciate her room being still a room
5th album?! 2021?! OMG!
Amazing 🤩
Why did I thought the left one was the younger one lol
I will never ever EVER fucking get over how underrated her voice is. actually insane
AH - MAZING!!!!
Wow I remember watching that vid 12 years ago lol. God, where did the time go?!?!
i remember watching this original video, the mems
It's the high five for me 😂
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
12 years later and she's still so underrated as a singer
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Brilliant as always
This should be recommended to my future self, if and only he survived all the ups and downs. Thanks Jessie for letting us know the previous Jessie.
おしらから
Queen!!!!!

it’s been 12 years but it’s like she barely aged! ofc she’s still young at 32 but still
Haha, yes I'll give you the comment you've been hoping for ;-) : you haven't aged a bit!
I love this! I cant wait for the new album. This is still my favourite song
She looks exactly the same I love her so much :)
You've grown, learned, and matured, Jess, never stop doing any of these. <3
Has she recovered from her health issue?
the queen has spoken
12 YEARS?! I couldn’t tell which the older Jessie was until she mentioned it! wow!
I aspire to be THAT talented..
ABSOLUTE QUEEN, GREAT MUSICIAN AND SINGER  I LOVE YOU JESSIE KEEP GOING ✨❤️❤️
Hahaha this is amazing. We stan!
Oh my gooood... i remember the day ive listened this cover in our living room.. i didnt have my own room and my father yelled out to me like "turn off this sooong!" I was just a kid 11 years old and wanted to discover youtube and jessie j lol... how can it be 12 years.... time is unfair...
Jessie this is soooo cool! 🖤
She's so cool i love her ❤️
Omg the nostalgia
You 👏🏼 are 👏🏼 everything!

Damn this is soooo cool!!! Jessie's comeback will be big for sure!!!!

I remember finding this video 12 years ago and repeating it on loop. Thank you for blessing us with your talent Jessie <3

Chills!🔥
Top singer,humble,so funny,very cute,sexy,intelligent...what a woman! 😁
Lol love it
I am smiling
Me talking to myself last month
Omfg!!! I watched that! This is awesome 😍
Come on JESSIE
How come younger Jessie has better audio than older Jessie  ?  😂. She still has the same great voice though 💯. ( forgot my e ) 😬
*"Mamma Knows Best"* But... I'm still confuzzled. Which one is from the past?
When you're soooo good that you are your only competition 😍😍
It's cool she's still living in the same place. Seems like most celebrities move often. She sounds great still
I love how she asked herself why she doesn’t have bedsheets on her bed because I was wondering the same thing 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
bitch I had that shirt in 2009 😭
"High five? No?... Ok..."
YOU. ARE. JUST. PERFECT. Did you know that? You are perfect just the way you are Jessie. And we love you for being that. <3
I still miss that fringe.
I've just added you again after 10 years on iTunes, can you believe 10 years ago I was photographing look a like's, glad to see your still around... you haven't aged a day... :)
Her voice is insane
Love you Jess ❤️ From india
Was this filmed with the same MICROWAVE??? 😑😑
Anyone freaked out when she said she's writing her 5th album? 😍😍😍
Omfg yaaaaassssssssss
THE BEST!
Oh I love you!!! So awesome!
Do it again in another 12 years. I like it, "Jessie j featuring Jessie j"
A queen, an icon, the legend 💖👑
Wow! Two Jessies at the same time. But new Jessie's forelock is too long.
THIS IS SO GOOD I LOVE THE IDEA
This was absolutely hilarious and awesome and all the above!! You can always count on Jessie for a good laugh and a good time!!
Timeless talent.
"I'm at home an no one asked me to sing Momma Knows Best" 😂
Please do another third one in 2033 <3
one of the most underrated singers in the world,her voice is amazing love you jessie❤️
Awesome😘
Made my day
Damn can’t believe it’s been that long
I remember watching the original when it was uploaded. I've grown old & fat since then, She's looks no different. Why does life hate me 🤣😭
Nobody asked for this but I'm definitely smiling from ear to ear. I loved you then and still now. WOWWWWWWWWW ! Its the nostalgia for me!
I swear I love you Jessie u will always be my idol
Jessie J will always be my favourite singer, she will never be forgotten
Pqp que vozzzzzzz 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Впервые вижу такое🔥🔥🔥
wow...jessie...still haven't changed a bit
This is such a great video and jessie is beautiful inside and out.
SLAAAAYYYY!!!
How come that the one from 12 years ago had better audio quality?😂
😘 ♥
Get your butt back in the charts gal!
"High five? No? Okay". So she's a comedian too, Yas queen 👑😂
I love how she looks exactly the same but her attitude says HI IM GROWN
this was awesome the second "they" walked in the door... it became even more awesome when "they" pressed record. Love it
One of my favorite song ever ! Thank you Jessie for this blessing
you just keep getting better and better i love you
YOU ARE GENIUS JESSIE!!
Forget it.. This quality of video? 480p in 2021. I just stopped watching after the first minute. So difficult to cut a video for a newbie I guess...
I'm dizzy.
Omg ur been NOT make a video for 3 YEARs
Love you so much Jessie
🤣😍
Hi Five?! No?? Ok
Please start doing bedroom covers again!!! 😍
did anyone else at first glance not know which side was Jessie now and which was Jessie 12 yrs ago 😳😂😍
I can’t deal with this! It’s a Jessie overload. My eyes are flicking left & right like a tennis match 😍
One of the most attractive and talented people!
Crying this is perfection
YES QUEEN OMG I NEEDED THIS
The fact I used to listen to this when it cane out when I was 8 and now I'm 20 is just crazy 😧
Amazing idea! Love it!
That awkward moment when the 12 year audio is better then today’s?? Still ICONIC😍
Feels like yesterday 🤧☺️🥰
After 12 years, her voice is still amazing😭😍😩 But more mature and skills. SAME ENERGY and SAME LOOK❤️✨🌹
Why have you got no bed sheets on your bed?!   ...weird 😒😂
Thanks god for Jessie J
Perfeita como sempre.
This is absolutely amazing!
I can't believe that was 12 years ago, how have you not aged?? It's a shame that the audio is so low on the new video compared to the old. It makes it pretty hard to compare them.
The best news yet
You should do 24 years apart too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex251O0doOc  Can i ask how does my voice sounds to you? I had a little confidence of my voice since the day i joined philippine idol and other tv reality singin contest when i was teen and failed...😔
Awesome girl.. Ur voice getting bigger and mature..
What with the salad bowl hair
Hasnt even aged a day✨
owh my GOD
This was awesome.. lol why dont yiu have sheets on your bed😂
God your gorgeous........
♥️♥️
I love all of Jess's little side comments that she has with her younger self like the "Why have you got no bed sheets on your bed?!" and the "I think it's time- High five? No...ok" just crack me up
Jessie, I love you, but that audio quality is shit. LOL
Amazing
You are a beautiful existing.
I saw this back then, and knew you were going to be a global superstar. I think the same thing now about Davina Michelle.
i didn't know that i need this
ahhhhh💚🧡🖤🤍🤎💜💛💙
I am so jealous of that prince shirt and colorful pants. P.S. this is one of your subsribers Kristina commenting! Thank you Jessie J!
You know her voice is amazing when the mic cant pick it up cus it so lound
wow 12yrs :)
Im a huge fan JJ!!!!
that's the proof that dreams come true
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Still the best....
She looks the same lmfao wow haha
How have I not heard this song it’s amazing and even more amazing because I get to hear you sing it
One of my all time favorite videos of yours. Happy you made this :) Also just watched your rendition of “I Have Nothing” on a show I think is called Singer. Brought good tears. Thanks for all the things through the years. Take care Also, it’s never too much :)
I sooo remember this video!! And I was like... this girl will be BiG!!! Bravo
Omg
Salut Jessie ! Je t'ai découverte quand tu faisait ces petites vidéos dans ta chambre. Et ca a tout de suite collé. Je me suis dit que cette nana avait une sacrée banane et quelle méritait de devenir une star. Autant de swing avec une voix pareille devait absolument creuver les enceintes. Et c'est ce qui est arrivé et j'en suis heureux. Have good life Jessie.
Con esta canción la conocí y justamente con este video 🤭🤭🤭la amooooo 💞
Wow
Jessie, you always know how to have a laugh! X
She 👏 has 👏 not 👏 aged 👏 a 👏 day 👏
we need domino instead of this ... actually Price Tag
Wow you haven’t aged one bit! Loved this
“I’m still at home and none of you have asked me to sing Mamma knows best” GIRL we’ve been waiting for this moment for 12 years!! This is awesome
Ti amornekemnemeo

PREACH 🙌🏼❤️
😂😁https://youtu.be/Tl-Wou65yYQ
9.82M followers and audio is worse 12 years later than your previous bedroom footage 😴😡😖🥴🤨
Is she still Channing her Tatum?
Just for a moment, imagine her duetting with another *real* singer like Adam Lambert. It would be the greatest thing in the world.
please drop something soon
This is everything!
12 years after but her hair still looks thick as hell. 👴🏻
This is the best thing i have seen in a while !!
No change for 12 years except the house no doubt. But man hardly aged. Jealous
see you in another 10 years
lmao it is so funny
I'm sorry, why doesn't this have millions of views already?? I love this!
I'm obsessed with this
Love this! So much fun. Still absolutely love your voice :D
She will never age up maan.. Her face is the freaking same as then wow
Nobody: surely!
Still listen to the 12 year old clip till this day 😂👌🏿 It never gets old. Loved that you revisited it 💜
I love this💕
I've got twelve year old clothes too.  They serve as a reminder of all the bad food choices I've made over that time.  You look fantastic Ms J.
Still one off the most incredible voices i have heard!
Forever a heartbeat, since the beginning x
how has her mic downgraded
Sing it!!!!
Didn't realise this was the woman who wrote "Price Tags" from 2010. Quite nostalgic.
Great work, Jess. Clever, funny and brilliant as always!
Cant believe she was only young back then time goes so fast 💖
Omg she’s writing her 5th album yes please I’m dying for her to come back with new stuffs finally!!!!
Looks the exact same
She is wonderful
awww I like this and her voice is sooo powerful omg

Hi! My baby i miss u so mach i love u!  😘😍🤗😜🥰😋🤫😴👅💋💋💋💓💘💖🧑John ling! Today Monday goodnight! Tomorrow working day! 😥🤫😴,! I 💓💘💖u 🌹
For me it’s 10 years ago when I moved to London and discovered Jessie J 🤩❣️
Jessie is so silly with her commentary about the old video. When she was hitting all them extra runs she gonna say “a bit much” 😂😂😂
I'm commenting to prove that i have been here
She recorded It whith the same old camera but the mic is broken now. Jokes apart, love you Jessie ❤️
OMG 🤪 Queen Jessie  Knows  best !
Hi to myself in 2033
This was too much... laughing so much 😂😂 Jessie, I didnt catch you until Do it like a dude actually dropped but of course watched these once you became known, I've been to only  3 concerts (not as many as I'd have liked) but bought every single album and some merch. You are funny, down to earth, and have an amazing voice. You are such a positive and radiant influence to young girls. Your ROSE albumn helped me rise up after leaving an abusive relationship, your Sweetalker albumn reminds me of some of the sweeter and happier times when I was with that person (as we came to a Sweettalker tour and listened to it constantly, which put them in a happier mood), and your Who You Are albumn was so big when we met, that it reminds me of the love bombing and falling in love. I've since fell in real love, and am treated like a queen,  we also came to a concert together and they follow you along with me, and enjoys you just as much as me. If I ever got to meet you, I'd want to be really normal and have a conversation but truth be told, I'd probably scare you 😂 I hope you are happy and feeling well.  I also fucking snorted at the newspaper photos of your date and your reaction - wishing you love and happiness in your relationship ❤
We have better technology now but the audio is better back then 😂
I can’t wait for your next album I have a feeling you’ll come back with a bang
🥺🥺 so cute
This video is amazing and hilarious a the same time, what a genius she is
She’s amazing
Love it!
Damn I love this song so much. This is amazing. Thank you, Jessie.
This is so strangely endearing and wholesome
This makes my heart sooo happy. I remember watching this video as a teenager over and over again. Such an amazing voice!!
I SHOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING!!! It is one of my favorite songs of yours.
Flawless
Jessie, thats perfect!!!! But fix the audio,  its soooo bad pls
Still a queen
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS

Absolutely Loved It 🥰🥰🥰
Lol great
Omg I remember the original video not knowing who Jessie J was and thinking “this woman will go far with that voice”
I honestly thought this was a duet on the same day - 12 YEARS IS LONGER THAN MY SIBLING HAS BEEN ALIVE - Jessie hasn’t changed in the slightest
IT'S BEEN 12 WHOLE YEARS!!????? WTHHH I remember watching this in primary school, i'm about to graduate uni now T_T Thank you Jessie for providing us with such amazing vocals and inspiration. I remember making my friends listen to your songs because i loved them so much and i wanted everyone to know you <3 I still love you, your personality and especially the message you sent with your lyrics back then after all these years. You'll forever remain a pillar of my childhood and i can't wait for whatever you put out next <3 Love you for life Jessie <3 <3 <3
This video deserves millions of views every day. ILY, JESSIE! 💓
The audio is messed up :(
Lovely!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ((((:
That was great seeing the difference between you back then and now. Both videos are amazing.
Childhood memories though
Love the fact she's still got the same outfit... shows she stayed grounded to where she's come, most would of changed their whole wardrobe and tossed the old stuff. Love Jessie J... her music def got me threw some tough times
i want to be her neighbour and everytime when she sings i would dance, no matter where i am😂🥰
Close to 10m subies
this so amazing !!
😍😍😍😍😍🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
You are amazing Jessie, I love you!! This made me so nostalgic!! Keep doing you 🎵 cause you do you so perfectly 🎶 ❤️❤️
I can barely fit into new clothes I buy, let alone something from 12 years ago lmao
It's around 11 years back that I subscribed to Jessica (Jesse) Cornish her youtube channel. Nice to see she's doing a duet with Jesse J..... Wait, they are the same girl?
I'M SO EXCITED FOR THAT UPCOMING 5TH ALBUM!!!!
LOVEE THIS ❤️
Jessie you shouldn't have done this cause now we gonna want to see all of the old videos done like this. Lol
Such a pure voice you are unique and beautiful! ♡♡ ALWAYS LOVED YOU
I love your humor! You don't look a day older than the one from the video 12 years ago!
THIS. IS. ICONIC.
Always impressive! The best voice and interpretation. Visceral, wonderful! We love you Jessie 🇧🇷❤
C'est ÉNORME !!!
C'est ÉNORME !!!
None of you asked for this.. All of us listen and admire Anyway 💝🥰
Be your best friend 😍 Twins 👯‍♀️  Love this JJ!
arghhhhhhh
" A bit much, A bit much" kills me 2:02 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This video bring me  old memories Jessie I'm always with you love you ❤️ #heartbeat
Should do it at the same time and see if your vocals have changed in 12 years ☺️
The fact that the original video was posted 12 years ago makes me feel soooooo old 😂😂 I watched it when it first came on and I'm here again now 💚
2:47 “Why have you no bed sheets on ur bed?... weird” 😂  2:55 *hand movement* “No.” 😂  I can’t you guys this is perfect !! xD
I loved it!
Amazinggg
The video i never thought I needed
WTH SHE DOESN'T EVEN AGE EVEN A BIT. SHE IS STILL YOUNG.
GIRL YOU HAVE NOT AGED AND NEITHER HAS YOUR VOICE
Mate I’ll never understand her fall into obscurity
omgggg 😍😍😍😍😍
I love her so much
"Why you got no bed sheets on your bed" lmaooo
😭❤️❤️❤️ THIS!!!!!!! Im just sitting here..cheeks hurting from smiling so hard, bopin’, singin’ and rockin’ out with my girls!!! Sang Jessie’s. Ps. How has it been 12yrs already 😩😭😭 THE heck! and you havent aged a day. Who else has been rockin’ with Jessie for 12yrs??🙋🏾‍♀️
Amazing to think she can sing with such power and control while sitting in the near lotus position!
Such a brilliant woman! 🌹
Jessie your the best 💙💚
You have one of the best voices period. I thought you would be mainstream for decades. Amazing talent my favorite is Nobody's Perfect
Is Jessie the only female vocalist able to sing her most challenging song 12 years later? Got damn, make another one cause she hyped me uppppp, NAMEEE HER 🗣
Sorry, I dont speak english, bye bye
I love you Jessie j and will always be
Obsesssssssed!! 🤣 this is awesome! Nostalgic af
If you could also sing Big White Room in your bathroom, my life would be complete 😇
What a wholesome video
السلام عليكم نحن من المملكة المغربية نحبك كثيرا صوتك رائع we love you
People watching this like: - in bed - not in a full screen - reading comments..........
she didnt age
Omg absolutely awesome 👌👏😍
You bring to my school in 2010
So clever 👏. What an amazing voice Jessie 👌 xxxx
You're my flashlight! Love you 🥰
I still watch that video from 12 years ago because it’s my favourite song, and favourite video... the fact there is a duet version of this just made my day! Love it!!!! ❤️
This is THE video I always drag out to show people how insane your vocals are (“I mean... she’s just sat on the floor, ffs!”). And now I have a 2021 version to sling around! 🙌🏻🤪
‘High five? No.... ok’ I love her so much😂😂
i rlly thought it was "how can i chew up someone"
SO COOL!!!!
“High five!” ✋
12 years later but nothing change ❤️
perfectionnnnn
🤩
For a second I was like "which one is the younger self" she really doesn't age.. and how does clothes from 12 year ago fit her😯 And her singing! She's a queen❤️
Lol
OMG! this gave me goosebumps 💗
Hahaha you are weird and I love it
one video is enough to show us how she is funny, creative, vocalist, and queen. AND SHE DID IT.
Okay this is something that I didn't know I wanted but absolutely needed lol
Et incredibile dictu mirabile !! A cunctis prospere agens habitabatque in mense omnes nos Mensis exolvuntur novum de novo incipit !! A amet # autem videat et usemáscaras
The amount of memories this brings back🥺♥️ This was literally the first video i saw of @jessiej It kept on popping up in my suggestions, and i was a bit annoyed, cause i didn't want to hear some teenage vlogger explain why her mum knew best😂 Man oh man, am i glad i caved and clicked the bloody link🥰😍 This happened just a few months before pricetag became a hit😁👌💯
Jessie cutieeeeee
Excellent....i remember that video very well...
She literally wore the EXACT SAME OUTFIT IN BOTH VIDEOS! 😂🤣😂👍
Awesome,  love  this duet. So unique. You looked amazing  12 years ago and still look amazing  now. Your voice is out of this world. Great song. So much fun.💜
Dang i was 11 years old when i discovered you here on youtube!!! Fell inlove with your voice as soon as you started. Love you always Jessie 🧡
Such an inspiration, love u
That was fun. :D
Always awsome
This was 12 years ago!! Remember coming across this!! Shut up! Ive wasted my life
The only thing changed was her Bangs
The only thing aged is the mic
This is so great!!
I love you so much! 😅
Woah! You're a vampire🤣❤️
You are awesome 🥰
One of the best vocals of this generation 💖

I THINK THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN BEAT “her” is “HER” 🤷‍♂️
SOOO AMAZING! Just me or someone else notice that her voice became even more beatifull after 12 years?
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I needed this reassurance because this single Momma has been doubting herself and your right Momma does know whats best and I keep forgetting who I am untill your beautiful face and voice makes it all clear again I sing away to your music like I'm up in a gospel choir but I'm all alone in my house singing all my worries and anger away music heals the soul and allows you to express yourself in a better safer manner then looking Ike the crazy girl or crazy momma love your style love your soul thank you for all you do to inspire others

Damn Guuuurl ♡ hello from suiss
Inspirational
❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
I love Jessie j from Philippines 💓💓💓
💓💓💓💓💓💓
Love it Jessie. Love you Jessie. To see how far you’ve come and you’ve got such more to come. Those glorious moments, events, days, months and years. You inspire me not to give up on life. Being born with a condition that like you made me live at GOSH till I was 5, not sure how long you were at GOSH, north Londoner here babes. Never Knew my mama and had to run away from home from a young age because of an abusive father. But I made my way through life. I’m a nurse of 18 years, toxicologist and an engineer. Though I’ve got a terminal prognosis right now and to say things are hard is truely an understatement but I’m going for teacher training was supposed to be last year, COVID-19, this year I’m going through some palliative surgical procedures so it’ll have to be next year. I’m analytical but not artistic at all. On my darkest days I watch you, I remember my patients whom had no chance but were wheeled out discharged home or were transferred to rehabilitation. That’s how I keep my feet on the ground by remembering that everyone has a story and we are all dealt cards in life. It’s how we play the card we’re dealt that matters. I know you will never stop inspiring so I will never stop trying to attain my goals in that as this thing I was born with changes I will also change with it to get back out there and continue to give back to society that though a challenge, has offered and given me so much.
Omg this is amazing. Never gets old
wow
"Hi 5? Hi 5? No? Okay."
Wow, a tiktok on youtube. Very cool.

Important points to consider: 1) same energy 2) same Jessie (many people change due to fame, they become egoic, not proud of who they were... BUT NOT JESSIE, satan) 3) the JOYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY 4) the BLISSSSSSSSSS 5) well, she’s always made me speechless. She’s a goddess and THIS is an important point to notice.  Love you since day one, Jess ❤️  From Brazil, F1 rocks (your first show here). We love youuuuuuuu.  This video is just one of a kind ❤️ made my sunday.
Why am I crying!!? 🥺 This is the best, Jessie. You're amazing. 🔥🤟🏻💖

Jesse You should re-release this with you as young and with you as older get a top person to put this together and see what happens with this video with a top mixer. You are so good Jesse nothing like you so individual with love from an oldie.
we dont deserve jessie ❤ so cute ❤

So amazing

Aww one of the first videos i saw of her videos. This is awesome
Love you, love your music. We also have something in common. I, too, have Ménière's disease. Hearing mostly gone in right ear now, but ringing still in both. I just wanted you to know you're not alone. There are a lot of Ménière's warriors out here. Including Huey Lewis (80's singer) and Kristen Chenowith (broadway actress and talk host) Please know that I am praying for you daily dear. Love and light always Jessie. ❤️🙏😇
She is sooo cool, I love this!!
This was so good! 👏👏❤❤
You have no idea how maaaaaany times I have listened to that first one over the years. It was always my favorite because it’s ... YOU.... no lights, no anything special just what comes across as authentic.
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH OMGGG
