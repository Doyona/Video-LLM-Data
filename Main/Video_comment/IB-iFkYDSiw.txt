you have a german family sitting on the throne of england. what is left to expose? 🕊️
Charles was NOT unpopular in the RN and I am no royal fan
Absolutely. They're the OG. Researching my own family's geneology I learned what they're really up to. All but a couple of USAs presidents are the British crown. WW1 was a bunch of 1st cousins fighting over land and family money.
Not my King, up the revolution we need a Republic 👊🏼
Australians don't want him as our head of state
Death dealers selling arms they should have Christian values but they are tyrants !!!!!
Anyone thinking of joining army go look at your future it's homeless on the streets you fought for then watch you king open up Buckingham palace for em
What's all there medals for stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour stolen valour
Royals get rid now we cant afford them
I think we all can agree that fundamental change is absolutely necessary for our survival
Remember when kings led their armies into war. Now they hide in palaces, the present king would probably seek asylum in an Islamic country. One thing I can say is that modern royalty has very strong shoulders to support all the medals and awards they have bestowed upon themselves, what a pity their spines are not so strong. The present king is there to protect paedophiles and Islamic states. The only real answer is the French solution.
Time for a Referendum on.
Gangster is right, the original Opium cartel.
brilliant well said......and anyone told u you sound bit like jason statham
There’s a book called “The Queen and I” by Sue Townsend about the family losing everything and moving to council houses. I thought the book would be funnier.
The Nostradamus fanatics who claim, among other things, that he predicted the bombing of the world trade center, also insisted that Nostradamus predicted that Charles would be the last monarch to sit on the British throne. 😮.
Respect to you for standing up against corruption 💯
As an Irish Catholic patriot and older Irish gay man living in the U.K. 25 years, where my grandfather on my Mum’s side defied De Valera and left the Irish free state army to fight in H.M. Armed Services in WW2, I hear and agree with your arguments, as I have many friends here in the U.K. who have loved ones in the Forces - for me, the monarchy died when the late Queen died and the history of both Lord Mountbatten and Prince Andrew really sickened me, as did the events of Princess Diana’s murder
https://youtu.be/XymxJXaImWk?si=sO3VhJCDwlfBxjIf
The king is not a king.
The royals are worse then shit they will run when the revolution is on.
Well said
Amazing words from a true freedom fighter 🎉
Robin Hood stole from the rich to give it to the poor so the rich just raised the taxes.
Johnny Rotten warned people against Jimmy Saville and he was cancelled. Turns out Jimmy had close friendship with the Royals. Charles even asked his advice on his speeches.  🤔🤔🤔
Sell by date long since expired on this so called British royal family care nothing about the common BRITISH PEOPLE 🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿TIME TO KICK THERE ARSE OUT ⚔️GET RID OF THE LOT ⚔️
I have never been a royalist ever. Refused to go to work aged 16  because the queen was visiting and no way was I going to curtsey to her🤨
Well look on the bright side they finally have learned to wipe their own asses. Groomers of the kings stool no more. Progressive bunch.. the Royal Mafia.
The ridiculous clicking sound makes this unwatchable 😢
we have been conned by the rf  for centuries. With all their billions we pay them millions a year and they contribute nothing to the people. Even royal charities have to be funded by tax paying workers, I hope their days are numbered!!
Charles was asked to contribute to the coronation. He refused.
WHITE MAN SPEAK WITH FOLK TOUNG…
I WILL NEVER FORGIVE THEM FOR THE MAU MAUS MASS MURDERS HIS MOTHER SIGNED THE PAPERWORK DEVILS
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS…
DEVILS IN HUMAN FORM THEFTS.
I heard there Reptillion alien shapeshifters.Did Lady Di see one of them.?????????
Yep and these hypocrits stand at the Cenotaph while evicting the veterans and housing illegal immigrants.
Lock the bloody lot of them up. I can't stand these fawning royalist idiots!
You said a lot of stuff as an anti-monarchist, but can your logic also apply to Japan? Japan is also a Monarchy but no one talks about getting rid of that monarchy...
BS
Erm.  this is exactly my question. What do people think will truly happen? Come on be honest?  They're the only reason we aren't a third world country . People need to be careful about what they wish for . Always someone out there ready to take the power n id rather the devil I know thank you!
They should ALL go Parasites!
God save the Queen. This King is doing nothing to save the people. If he does nothing, why have him?
It's interesting to hear this as an American. In the US, I think we are more enthralled with the royal family that the Brits are, but we don't have to pay for them. I believe that they are not just alone but are the top of an entire pyramid of aristocracy. In all the fairy tales, the woman's ultimate sign of success is marrying a prince who will become a king.  I am slightly interest in Harry. Somehow, he wanted to step out of the royalty role. However, what else is he capable of doing? The rest of the world has to work and contribute based on their skills. What skills does he have? I can't think that wearing great outfits and cutting ribbons has much of a demand in the real world. I mean, what in hell does he do????
Well Mr. Joe Glenton, thanks for your anti-RF rant. It is based on The Politics of Envy I believe. I have read your book which is simply nothing less than a Communist Diatribe. I didn't agree with the Doctrine of Joseph Goebbels or the view of his boss Adolf but 'oh boy, could they hold an audience. and a great deal of that audience, unlike yours, numbered many intellectuals. By the way, Humans do NOT cross-pollinate THEY propagate!
The vast majority of Poles living in the UK are honest, decent, law-abiding people. But as with everything else in life, there will be exceptions. One of those exceptions is a Polish woman called *Mariola Popko.* She works for a company called *James Gibb Residential Factors,* based in Scotland. A "factor" in Scotland is a property management company (equivalent to Homeowners Association (HOA) in the USA). Popko's job at *James Gibb Residential Factors* is to issue tenants and homeowners with legal threats should they not pay their invoices. Many homeowners/tenants have refused to pay their bills/invoices because they know that these bills are bogus and highly inflated. *James Gibb Factor* forces homeowners/tenants to pay for "services" that have not been rendered and charges them THOUSANDS OF POUNDS just to cut grass and fix fences. JGibb even extorts tenants into paying inflated home insurance. Basically, that is what this company is: extortionists. A criminal outfit masquerading as a respectable company. Just take a look at this https://www.trustpilot.com/review/jamesgibb.co.uk -- THAT is the company that *Mariola Popko* works for. And when a homeowner warned Popko (in an email) that he would expose her criminal conduct (it IS a crime to extort money from people by threatening them with legal repercussions should they not pay these fraudulent bills), the homeowner received an email from a Senior Associate Director of that company, *Marianne Peters,* threatening the homeowner with police action. That is how career criminals do their business. They intimidate those they defraud by trying to turn the tables and making the VICTIMS look like THEY are the criminals. STAY AWAY FROM *JAMES GIBB RESIDENTIAL FACTORS.*   Note that *James Gibb Residential Factors* are owned by a company called *STRATHSPEY CAPITAL* which is headed by a man called *_Stuart Macpherson Pender._* Pender is the person into whose pockets the hard-earned cash of thousands of victims is flowing. https://register.fca.org.uk/s/individual?id=003b000000LUjK0AAL   P.S. Scotland's Housing Minister, Paul McLennan (MSP, i.e., Member of Scottish Parliament) has, in the past, shown an unusual degree of sympathy for this "factor". He was approached by a tenant who felt that he had been cheated by James Gibb Factors out of thousands of pounds over a period of years and he wanted McLennan to do something about it, but McLennan not only rebuffed him but encouraged the tenant to stop pursuing James Gibb Factors, period. Something pretty insidious seems to be going on.
They're not really morons. Takes some cleverness or good advisors to maintain their extravagant privilege. They have a function in the Westminster system but more people are questioning that now. In one sense they are captives, and they cannot solve Britain's problems now.
The revolution in England failed;  they were worse than the monarchy, life was miserable.   That's why we don't talk about it.
There's no mystery to it.  It's all part of what the philosopher George Carlin called the Earth Freak Show.  Much ado about nothing.  Business as usual.
THEY  R  A  LAZY  LOT
TRUE
Look how they treat the wind rush generation
Royals larping as soldiers 😂 this boy is cookin
The Crowns are a Cartel, which is why it goes on, with the whole situation stitched up by everyone swearing allegiance to the Crown.
Wow this guy is a hero
as a Brit living in France, i feel like he might have missed the mark with his description of France
Royal wankers
The whole idea of Monarchy is an anachronism; it belongs back in the early Medieval Ages, not now.  This lot, of the German House of Saxe- Coburg, with a dash of Greek, have no useful purpose at all.  There is NOTHING in what they do that England couldnt do without. They contribute nothing, and live in unimaginable luxury while people who have worked all their lives are struggling to either eat or stay warm.  And the current King is a rabid hypocrite. He carries on an affair with his mistress while married; he is close "best buddies" with a notorious, horrific pedophile, Jimmy Savile, even saying he was his mentor, and calling on him for advice on his marriage, and carried on the friendship when it has been shown Saville was still abusing children.   Yet he strips his own brother of everything that had made his life, simply because of an unproven short lived association with a man not known by anyone to be a pedophile at that time, and who ended the relationship immediately it was know, over 25 yrs ago.  Who the blazes is Charlie to throw stones in this affair???  I'd suggest Charlie should be required to surrender the Crown and relinquish all his titles and retire to small cottage somewhere.
He wore a Field Marshalls uniform on the cenotaph today, stolen valour
Andrew personifies the corruption
Get rid ASAP all the creeps accepting bobles beckham 🤢🤮
The monarchy need the press to remain relevant and keep the grift alive. No wonder Harry lost his court case.
Time to Eat the Rich !!
biggest gangsters of the world...
Hes literally an Islamist traitor for WEF and Qatari and monarchy sold us to the Middle East in the 80’s
It seems you totally right,  he just buried his own brother 😂
Chubby fingers has them in lots of pies trust that
You are a man of vision Joe .
🇬🇧 Monarchy Nonce 👑
Absolutely spot on.
As a person who grew up on that island west of Great Britain,I have never been able to understand the unquestioned and irrational worship  of a rich  family
The old women waving look so absurd. 😂
Looks like Mr Andrew Mountbatten Windsor might just be the final straw - HOORAY!!
Where is Charles and Saville??
The windsors are an embarrassment to all the British people.
I personally have a lot of respect for the French.  They knew how to bring down their monarchy.  Your police force is also corrupt, because they blatantly refused to investigate Andrew when Virginia Giuffre made formal reports on two separate occasions before having to sue.  The police don't swear to protect and serve the people, apparently they only swear allegiance to the monarch.
Are they worse than thee US oligarchs?
This is a pointless video, Charles can’t help the cards he’s been dealt he was born into it, it’s the British public at fault for encouraging it all
Princess Anne is the only reasonable one of the bunch.
The RF are nothing more than a bunch of greedy, self entitled bed hoppers.
How much does the French Republic spend on their Head of State?
The “Nobility” are simply gold plated murderers. Jimmy Savile. Nuff said.
YES…. King Charles has become King Henry VIII and now Prince William is Ruthless!!! How one handles his family members is a testament on how they will rule their country. Watch & See 👀 Remember how Queen Elizabeth ruled 😒
APPART FROM ALL THE MEDALS CHARLES,S MUMMY GAVE HIM ... CAN ANY1 TELL ME WHY HE,S WEARING THE .."LSGC MEDAL" ,,,,HIS RAF WINGS ..

Praise and Bless our Lord Jesus Christ, amen. Hebrews 9 -- 27 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:
Ephesians Chapter 6 -- 12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
Brilliant.
Yes  and now the Mayor of London  is  challenging king Charles, would you prefer the likes of him instead?
Its the biggest scam ive ever seen 😂!!! They live free from shaking hands with people 5 times a year 👏 did we forget what charles and camilla DID TO DIANA?THEY'RE 🐍 🐍 🐍 🐍 🐍 🐍
They will all destroy themselves from within its   started already. P
Charles has always been dodgy even in the 70s like his brother, Prince  Andrew  they didn't  call Andrew randy Andy  for nothing in the  80s
A mafia type entreprise
Just the amount of money spent on jewels, clothes, homes, protection…..what to the “little” people get?
_Bunch of bumbling peasants sucking up to a family of inbred morons_  Damn, that made me laugh! 🤣
I love the thought of Charles and Camila in a damp council flat on benefits 😅
Gods, popes , kings , queens,, what a deluded world i live in.
Speaking of being inbred. One of Andrew's daughters, the thinner of the two, I believe her to be Beatrice, seems unable to close her mouth due to an extended lower jaw.       It always reminds me of the Hapsbergs and their over bite trouble. You see it in painting. I believe it was the Hapsbergs? Poor thing always reminds me of a horse face .
How does he know all of this?
Charles is the most useless human on the planet. He's not helping his own people while being taken over by Islam. What king does that? Lets these miserable monsters in the country to take over?  Don't be fooled by William and Kate either.  What they really are is a business.
Part of the ninth circle
Tell me if I am wrong.  Mommy gave Charles the fourth medal from the left for brushing his teeth every day.
As a native New Zealand Māori guy i strongly approve of this video😅 lets go!!
He is the world's largest real estate owner. He owns as much property as 85 Germany!  Despite this, none of Charles's castles housed Muslim immigrants.Oh, how interesting! He loves them so much!
There should be no Kings, or Royals for any free country to support.  The corruption is disgusting.
Just not replace them with islam/ sharia...
King Charles vs Cromwell was about the King controlling the assets of foreign escapades, privateers and slavery for example. After the beheading of Charles, the slavery plantations in the Caribbean he started were joined by many more owned by Cromwell's colleagues.
If Charles wasn’t born into royalty he’d be a loser what has he actually achieved
Their wealth comes from us the working people
My daughter and my brother and my father and I are all members of the Royal family. And what's even worse is not just this royal family but six in total we are nothing but pure Royal blood my father is first cousins with Charles listen to this shit.....  Donald Trump threatens to kill my family every single day traffics them to people who torture them, and rape them  Donald Trump is a bigger drug addict than anybody I've ever met in my life. He actively traffics my family and the Soma auction online on the dark web. Pimping them out and making billions of dollars because of who they are.  All day long. I will not tolerate one more f****** minute of this s*** The last video I just posted  People need to start downloading the phone activity and histories of the people around me and the activity going on around the traffic my family night and day and torture them anywhere I go they go to. It's the most disgusting s*** you've ever seen in your life total blatant corruption
The royal family does not worry me iether way.I always thought it was like winning lotto.If you are born into it good for you.
The Monarchy is the umbrella of the class system.
the best way to reform the monarchy is if Charles abdicate and let William on the throne. William surely is better than Andrew, Harry and Charles combined
We don't teach how awful we were in history!!
Continue the flow of the beheadings
And also related!
Tell us something that we don't know.
King Charles should step down-pompous, mean and damaged.   Camilla is useless and lacks class.
We ditched it a long time ago in the USA. For some reason Canadians are a bunch of boot licking royals.
Well that's eye opener
Charles should have stepped down a long time ago and Andrew should have had all of his titles removed. I think the royal family is on its way out
wow, you don't mince words!
Anyone who willingly accepts someone else to rule over them are the real slaves and are also devoid of any dignity!
They do charity we work
💯 The monarchy needs to fall. These people shouldn't be in power just because they're related to the previous idiot. It's horrible. This should've ended in the midieval era...like with Henry VIII.
Yes that’s fine!
Thank you sir for your nice remarks, though we seem to be dumber through the years and the french coolness of jp Belmondo and jean marais is long gone, the food and the mouring in a weird french language stills exist, heureusement d'ailleurs !!!!
The poly-tricks of envy don't work either. It's patronising to tell the viewers to learn from history when you so blatantly fail to do so yourself.   Reform is required, but not led by traitorous highway robbers!   True Britons must not get fooled again.
Carles and Saville..... ?
2 years later and Charles is makig the news over a little thing about Andrew....But let's look at this situation: Philip also sex abused a 14 year old ....He taught Andrew he was better than females and deserved to buy them in a Hellish industry which is built on pedophilia of little girls, sex abused, and groomed in childhood: and entry age is almost always childhood....and if not in rare cases there is still the conditioning and horror of the child sex abuse etc but all that is what Andrew and any john 'deserves' for their sex power kicks.?? No Sir!....and Charles was best buds with Saville if I am not mistaken....What a mess.  Charles needed to do something ages ago and that something needed to be more than this too little too late joke, that seems more self-serving than anything at this point.
Family of parasites. No qualifications, yet they expect EVERYBODY to work for them!  JUSTICE  TO THE PEOPLE!
I have been so encouraged by this that there are still honest decent people in the UK. How would you explain to a child what a king actually was or what a knighthood is. Chosen by God , what a crock of shite that is
TRUTH TRUTH TRUTH TRUTH….WAKE UP UK….It’s ALL yours!!!
Johnny Rotten, aka John Lydon now a true blue sadly!
become a republic oldmate
Absolutely agree!
Why should I take a blind bit of notice of Charle’s waffle about climate change. How many life times would I have to live to equal his carbon footprint? 100? a 1,000?
Definitely not sexy
*Israel/ Mossad messing-up everybody that they want to Blackmailing and Ransomware*  the Massos and they Rothsch*lllllllllld...  & more... **they are like that**
What would you say are some good things regarding your 21st Century British Monarchy?
What do you have to say about Prince Harry?? (2025)....
This guy is right ! Stolen millions of acres of land from the Scot’s from the Irish with Cromwell killed thousands of Irish Brit’s they own 16 countries for what why do they own and rule all these countries ?  Then created the potatoes fathom by queen Victoria the when the Irish died off and moved to the state on slave ships Ireland became filthy wealthy .
You are correct.
Do something about it then.
He grows opium privately’ avoiding import taxes
The time for exposure is now for these parasite elites. They are narcissistic in nature, power hungry and totally unbalanced. Well done am proud of ya.
💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯 Vive la republique! 🟦⬜🟥
Who killed Dianna ?
The royals bring money for themselves and don't give back anything.  Prince Harry gave more in 5 years than what Queen and her fore relataives gave in 150 years
https://youtu.be/GcrkJihcy6A
the masses could pull them limb-from-limb if they knew
two years later statues of liberty get flagged WOKE
what a sad dude, grumpy AF  let the tradition and the kingdom fall and youll see how deep in the dust UK goes.
Just imagine we have no Monarchy. There'll be prime minister or president,  with no accountability to people... it'll be  a total Disaster!!!
Wrong!! they do a lot of Charity work, not just cutting ribbons!! Bring business from all over the world!
THEY ARE TRASH FREEMASONS ❤
Who is here after the york book?
There is no need for a Monarchy any more , subjects are paying their very hard earn cash for what to put those Germans on a throne that does nothing for then  !
I thought that the majority of the British people are FOR the monarchy.
Fascinating, thank you!
I will never understand why some people will insist on defending the BRF till their last breath. They are greedy, pampered, spoilt bludgers. They don't give a damn about the average person, and their daily struggles. They are worth billions! They could easily sell a few antiques and give the proceeds to charity. They are the richest dole-bludgers in the world.
Yes, let’s do away with the monarchy and we can have a President. Someone like …… President Blair? ….. or President  Brown? I know which system I prefer for the UK.
Send Prince Harry and William to Ukraine.
Having a Royal Family is so outdated, a bit like a Fairy story. They are no different to us, infact most of them are not as good as us. after divorcing Charlie Boy , Princess Diana forecast she'd be killed & lo and behold she was killed. I cant believe how that Camilla woman can be accepted by William & Harry, as she was the woman that wrecked their mothers marriage. Maybe thats why Harry is like the way he is? I wouldnt want to be near her either. .
We all know what Charles did to get free of Diana’s popularity!  He married an ugly artless second wife who had no love only greed and the satisfaction that came from lording it over Diana and Charles felt more noticed. I can’t stand him.  I can’t stand either of them.
Long OVERDUE to cut the monarchy loose, we don't need them, we can't afford them, dump them and be done.
Mate...without the royal family...what would the UK be???
Makes sense.  Why else do they call themselves The Firm?
I am surprised you don’t get rid of the whole bunch…they don’t do anything for you and your country , except for draining , sucking the life and money out of your society ….
charlie boy windsor is a LAND THIEF and his mother, dear oldv queen Liz signed off 28 WARS!!!! Monsters the lot of em
God bless and protect this Man!!!! 🙏❤🙏❤🙏❤
Well said Sir..
Tell it man....tell it. The Americans saw through this BS.....let freedom ring.🇺🇸
You couldn't put them in a council house because they are reptilians and they shift shape ! They aren't humans !
FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.   Telling us things we already know but we're grateful for the confirmation.  But do we want to replace them with a Republic like the USA or France and Germany  ?
Get a job
Canadians do not want the monarchy any longer
Thanks, mate.....!

France had not a " revolution", it was a ma--- sonic coup d'état
Up the republic  time for the people not the opulent rich royals
Ok. Don't disagree totally with these points. But you using France as an example of utopia(?) Really?  The punk generation were subdued by monetary gains, riding the crest of the privatisation waves that swept through the UK. As for the monarchy, yeah a gang (yeah, top of the tree) going out into the world, Having resource holders swindled out of the resources we as a nation needed to keep our "lights on"...a former "enforcer" wakes up...!! Sorry to sound so dismissive but please France ain't Utopia...PS: I don't have a route to Utopia. But despite a rough trip through life, I did appreciate the lights, when they were on. For the record.🙄
AMEN AND 🙏 🙏 🙏
WHY DON'T THE BRITS FIND THE COURAGE TO EXPOSE HIGH LIVE PEDOPHILE FREEMASONS, AS LUCIFER WORSHIPERS? SATAN HAS TAKEN OVER YOUR GOVERNMENT! ARE YOU ALL POWERLESS COWARDS? I KNOW YOU ARE, BECAUSE MY GRANDFATHER WAS A HIGH LEVEL BUCKINGHAM PALACE FREEMASON, A SEXUAL CRIMINAL, THE PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN LACE-WORKERS UNION, AND THE REGIMENTAL SERGEANT MAJOR OF THE QUEENS GUARD IN CANADA!  ELIZABETH AND PHILIP WERE CHILD MURDERING PEDOPHILES. PROVE ME WRONG, I DARE YOU.
😢
I thought when the queen died. It was the end of the royal family.
Absolute truth brother! Good on you!
It's like you've read my mind 🤣You have very eloquently put in to words exactly what I think Thanks!
The Robinhoods are the ones that are living in the states like California and take from the rich by being lazy and living off our tax money.
Just found this.  Joe you are very eloquently and knowledgeably right in what you say.   As an Irish person, my country is divided.  Check into what the Black and Tans did in our beautiful island.  The men were the scraping of the barrel and were paid very well to persecute and torture the young lads who were wanting their country back.
What do you know about his ten day trip to romania after coronation.. What do you know about his connection to several petals Saville lord Mountbatten bishop peter ball He kept right in that one after he went to jail...
No one is entitled to rule.
Charles lack of involvement while authoritarian Starmer destroys free speech and democracy in UK is astounding.
Your view, not mine. Of course the monarchy is flawed. Would you like to make England even greyer and sadder than it is with some globalist politician puppet as head of state, and sweep away all our colourful traditions?
Kings and queens are self appointed snakes and lizards... No one voted for them... Time for an end ... They suck the blood out of citizens... They are flesh eaters and blood drinkers... Lizards...
They absolutely are. They kill a steal, even though an exile who want nothing to do with them ….evil pure evil.  It’s so interesting to me how he claims Russia is a threat. He just wants to slimy little fingers on imperial assets. He thinks his late father has the right to, but I have news for him not going to happen.
Youre venting which is good. But no one in the UK gives a sh*t. Sad isnt? 😢😢😅
Time to install the electric guillotine at Trafalgar Square. 😅
Well said my friend, all the power to you for saying it as it is. God bless you keep safe and keep on enlightening the misled and the ignorant.
World Class Grifters.
Anyone else thinking did Bonnie Prince Charlie go to Epstein Island back in his youth , don't forget he was known as a womaniser , If Randy Prince Andrew and moose Fergie were there then its quite possible Charlie boy went there too , and maybe that's why he's sucking up with Trump cos Trump's got Name's 👀🤔💯
As an American,  we look at the Monarchy, all the castles, uniformed guards on horses, the majesty of the halls of THESE castles,  their opulence as the stuff of Fairy tales, the Centuries of Kings governing the people,  ect.  HOWEVER; the sheer wealth across the UK thats been amassed, the jewels alone, is STAGGERING, the price of just 1 of Princess Catherine's outfits, ranging in the thousands of pounds!!  This kind of absolute luxury for people who do not have real jobs is mind blowing!!  Yes the fairytale King & Queen of Centuries ago, is no more. The Reality of the shape of the World today, held against what a Monarchy WAS is no more. In these modern times as leaders of diff EU Countries are literally  stripping away peoples personal rights, running these  Countries & major Cities into the ground , people struggling to JUST SURVIVE is to much!!  All while the Royals entertain dignitaries in posh style w/5 star EVERYTHING & British/English War Heros living in cardboard boxes, people standing peacefully outside an abortion clinic, not muttering a word, ARRESTED by thought Police,  someone arrested for a non-violent text post or illegals given 5 star accommodations?  Time for a change in Govt & distribute the WEALTH the Crown has amassed among its Citizens. Its their money anyway. Their ancestors broke their backs so the King or Queens coffers would be filled & they could live in luxury & be recognized as Elites!  This is just 1 Americans opinion, but  if the current Political climate in the UK does not change, all will be lost.
What do you expect from inter breeding no wonder they are bat shit crazy
The king is so corrupt it's unbelievable he is in bed with the WEF Diane knew the little worm would be a bad king....the queen held on as long as she could because jug ears is a corrupt git.
I love this man he talks Truths..
They are also reptilien (blue-blooded)... they are not human
Disgusting  video  Do you not realize how  those royals work! I grew up during the war in England and l daily thank the royal family for everything. How we all crowded around the radio to hear the king. How their efforts kept all our spirits up and determination. I m so glad you weren't leading the country!
god save the queen   she aint no human being
Does 400 years of UK  harsh history  confirm Jeffrey Sachs  words that UK is one of most savage  countries in the world Best example is India they suck everything  They forced Australia 2 sign Surendering own souvernity  2 continue b Nothing  but.

My comment to this gentlemen was blocked by UTUBE as usual
Royalty is a movie a program. A  bloody shame. Move them up, move them out. For All countries🎉
They’re the biggest frauds…
Thank you. I know of a family that had a coat of arms. Yet 1 in the family spoke out against this institution and it didn't go well for them. A father murdered, brother arrested and drugged into a state of illness now in a care home.  To use the Book and say they rule by it's wisdom yet to see a queen swarn into a druidic ideology.  Guess that why so may go missing ever year under thier rule. So thank you for being strong enough to speek the truth. A Republic and a truthful knowledgeable vote is what in now a necessity.
I just keep reading about how his wife is a thief, taking QE2s stuff and crown stuff. Why isn't she in the tower? 🤔
Why now? What is he trying to do. If it's so important, surely it should have been aired right from the start! I'm sick of all the crap going on , trying to put down the working Royals. I could be very wrong, but I'm not here to watch, and listen, I'm off! Tarra! Edit: even more suspiciously, the darned post is TWO YEARS OLD!!!
Just leaches

Lol😊😊😅😅😅🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂😂
Not my king
Out of date
What good is a king that doesn't defend the faith. The royal family are obsolete.
This argument has been going on since THE PEOPLE of GB took 99% of the power away from the monarchy but insisted on keeping it.  Stop belly aching about them, they bring a fortune to the country through tourism.  They are Ambassadors of the country.  They represent you.  GB has a crappy economy for many reasons, all of which the PEOPLE supported via the vote.  You wanted Socialism, now live with what comes with it.  If you don’t like that anymore, change it.  Stop re-electing the same Socialists as if a new Socialist can change their Socialist ways. 😅😂
Arguments against the Monarchy notwithstanding, you really haven't been to France in a long time have you? It's not the sixties anymore lol.
Totally agree with you. I was raised on family tales of WW2, of Battle comic, Airfix soldiers & model kits & Action Man, then joined Army Cadets - All l wanted was to join the Paras. But l didn't because I'm anti Royalist - l couldn't pledge allegiance to HRM Liz or her Govt of Thatcher at the time. You're so right there re The Sex Pistols & Punk being an influencer.
If you have read about the monarcy over the centuries, their absolutely disgusting....GET RID OF THAT ARCAIC BULLSHIT
It is just obscene yeah the gangsters who couldn’t fight their way out of a paper bag
. . . but how does he really feel?  😂😂
Yup
It’s this leftist propaganda that’s crippling our country. The classic food bank narrative which is completely blown out of proportion, the poor teachers’ that get 13 weeks of paid leave every year.. ‘the poor train workers’ that can earn 70plusK a year…still always on strike because they want more.. trust me I know. I’m a firefighter and many have left to join the trains and they are absolutely laughing. Oh yeah and the ‘poor nurses’ My mate decided to become a nurse in his 30’s within 4 years he’s a band 8 and earns £60,000 a year driving around in a brand new Audi.  As a firefighter I know first hand how the highest ranking officers at times have seen the less amount of action but that’s life. We just love to moan.  I don’t blame people for not being rotalist I can see valid points on both sides but this content  just feeds the idea that yes people should be dammed for flying our flag. At a time when we’ve completely lost our culture and identity do this extreme left.   I found this channel interesting at first particularly the stuff around Gaza and the war crimes, but the more I watch it’s clear there’s a narrative to this content, carefully selected. Anyway I hope this guy makes good money selling his book about the monarch 😂
Ooooh yea many many millions know the truth with the stolen monarchy.
Charles should resign
Here 8 mos later. You’ve been given away
He is evil
Guns were made for a reason.
I have no time for the scoundrels! Their royal ship is sinking!
G.m
It's "Guelph" not Windsor.   🤨
I agree
You are so bitter you should work on it
It’s Satanic!  Evil Hidden for generations! Lied to our whole lives!
What a GUY!
GOD help us !!
Is self evident !! The rothschilds and zionists banksters ruling with their armies who are the real criminals ,kings dont function without armies !!!
Civilization is collapsing under the heavy weight of wickedness and corruption.......👺👹
“Inbred morons” sums the Royal Family accurately. They can’t even disagree because Charles himself is ~10% inbred and a thorough wanker. The idea that some fake god blessed this family line with outrageous wealth and privilege, paid for by their peasants, is so absurd it flies in the face of reality. They should have been abolished in the 90’s when we realized this whole system is rigged by inbred idiots grifting on a mass scale. The fact that he could end the British Invasion of illegals and gangs with one stroke, but instead seems to be concerned about pandering to the muzzies, one has to wonder where his loyalties lie. We aren’t a bunch of backwards thinking people anymore, so this royal farce needs to rejoin normal life and get a JOB. 🎉
It’s the 21st century for gods sake.  Let’s drop this royal family nonsense.  The royal family is nothing more than an entitled bunch of scumbags.
True Soldier
I used to think of the BRF as the "genteel" Mafia. Maybe not so "genteel." Thank you for your coursgeous remarks. 🤗🇺🇸
We need to remove this government that uses our money to give to young fighting islamic illegal immigrants to do this, we all need to, Stop Work! Stop Paying Taxes And Astronomical Utility Bills! Then we have a fantastic chance to change things!  Deport all illegal immigrants! Close all boarders! Bring down the astronomical high cost of living!  Our Fallen Soldiers From World Wars One And Two did not die for us to give Our Homelands England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 Ireland 🇮🇪 Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 and Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 to islam! Raise up our homeland flags outside all our homes to show respect to Our Fallen Soldiers for unity and solidarity!
👣🦘  how many people are even aware the monarchy originated FROM GERMANY  ?🇩🇪 😂🤣 People are so stupid.  It hilarious THE ENGLISH MONARCHY ARE GERMANS 😂🤣🤦🏻‍♀️
The Nation needs a King One who cares about his people and willing to do what he has to in order to enforce their rights These suckers have been utterly unfit for Kingship for generations  Christ is King Anyone who isn't sufficiently Christ-like is destined to be dethroned and decrowned
Charles is 77 in November 14, 2025
Heresy! 😄
Genocidal pedophiles
Organized crime family....they even call themselves "The Firm"
What is he talking about?
This inbred king is an Absolutist, he couldn’t care less about the people of England, and doing the most heinous crime of all by a Christian king to turn his back on Christianity for the Muslims.😡😖😤
The monarchy is an anachronism in the 21st century.  But if a majority of the British people are happy with it, I see no reason to abolish it.  I believe William will dramatically slim it down, so that may save it.  But be careful when you are so rabid to overthrow a system that is functioning at the sufferance of the people.  Revolution must be carefully thought out first.
I work with the homeless and i have always thought the queen and now charlie could house them with all his wealth 💯😢🙏
The Coronation was a farce not a Coronation at all, and is it even Charlie we see i dont think so, the World Universe is not what we think it is, bring on the Great Awakening ! and their name is not Windsor thats another lie
Our school history classes didn't cover the English Civil War much.  I just remember the teacher saying the English wanted the king back and disliked the Puritans as they were no fun.  I read a bit about the Scots entering the war and it was stupid and costly for them.  And the king had a Catholic wife but allowed people to practice Christianity whether Catholic or Protestant.  The Puritans were heavily influenced by the German problems (was it Luther and the 30-year war?) at the time and were goaded into the war.  It was a mess.  Cromwell had some good ideas such as universal education. I never understood the wanting to curtsy to someone as I am a bit of a Puritan and admired them for sailing in the Mayflower and starting their colony.  Their witch-hunts were nothing compared to the Germans and the Scots.  (Fancy preferring to curtsy rather than have a universal education.) My Scottish mother really disliked the Royal Family and as we had Queen Elizabeth, and lived in England, we hoped no one would hear her.  I guess she wasn't wrong.
Tell me how you actually feel about the monarchy. 😂😂
The royals are demonic reptilians.
And that rat swine harry
I'm interested to know if the British Army will defend Britons or the gangsters.
The only person in the monarchy of ever cared for with princess Diana the rest of them might as well be called fascist in Britain
Buck Palace ...isn't that the biggest ,grandest council house on planet earth ? Hmmmm ......
I think Americans have a greater loce affair with the royals than the Brits do.  As far as their revolution, Cromwell only ruled for a short time, shortly after which Charles II took back power. He was a total reactionary who even dug up Cromwell's body to behead him. So much for that revolution. As prince, this Charles actually used his position to make well over $1 billion.
Hang them high.
Hes not part of the Solomonic lineage, only HAILE SELASSIE THE FIRST IS THE REAL KING, EARTH'S  RIGHTFUL RULER.
Why do we have to pay a billionaire pensioner to do nothing
Isn't king Charles the head of the satanic organization Known as the "free masons"and obviously he lead the 72 Countries who bowed down to Baal aka Satan and 🐂 Allah.....pos, satanic guy 😢
2022 Common wealth games 🐂 72 Countries bowed down to Baal aka Satan and Allah and king Charles lead them.....
And the royals who actually do good things are cut out because the hardly do anything’s get jealous
History will remember him as Charles III "the woke", servant of the WEF.
"The French Model".. Oh how I love it !!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Hey! It worked !!!
The Fabian Society has come to the fore in these last couple of weeks.... people beginning to ask questions about it and discussing it.
Search up Tim Cohen, and his book"The antichrist and a cup if tea" apparently charles converted to islam in the 90s and is the antichrist. He gives lot if imagery and proof. You can watch his podcast on Shaun Atwood channel
There has never been a Human allowed Devine Right, therefor all kings are illegitimate!!!
You rude
A crowned mullah !
Hey Charles.  Charles!  You're a bloody wanker!
Love your thoughts! KC is a weak king and that’s stretching it. He’s let the no good Muslims in and is chinning up to them. They are going to take over Britain. Even Andrew with his reputation has better morals than KC. God save England. KC is selling the citizens down the drain.
eat the rich
Iman chipolata Charlie is a disgusting traitor to Christianity,  to Britain and the British people.
He is corrupt and greedy
And friends of pedos.....
wow man  are you in prison?
No wonder his mum held on so long you don't get to vote for monarchy
They are FAR worse than anyone even knows.  ⚽️  When you know, you know.
Royals Bull Shit
the king is in charge of the country, he can dissolve parliament and fire the prime minister. they work for the king. most people don't know that but its law of the UK
They are all a twenty first century joke. In fancy dress and medals.
No wonder the UK is in such a bad way when gommunists like this are allowed in the army.
They have their own private money.  You only pay £1.5.
Thevr9yalscdoca lot for britain.  Shamevon you.
Go away!
Detatched from reality!
I can't agree! Teacher's, doctor's, nurse's!!!  What about the cleaner's, retailer assistant's, street sweepers, refuse workers!!! Who are you?!!!!
William has the attributes to make a great king. IMO. This guy sounds like a commie.
KC has forsaken the people.  Release the pictures of KC wearing his muslim garb.
They are not worth the price anymore, lve never been anti royalty but always believed any monarchy represents everything rotton about society.
This popped up this morning. In the 2 years since this was posted it’s just got worse! Charlie boy puts Islam first and I despise him.The rest of them come out in their couture clothes rubbing our noses in it. William will be no better. Diana knew too much!
End the monarchy now!
No wonder Charles isn't prepared to confront Starmer and his communist type  rule of the UK. Starmer is surely commiting treason, and the monarchy is quiet.
Your government has let the muslin invade and take over your country. Your new king will be Mohammad if you don’t act soon.
You are not a person to follow.
The queen held on for so long because she knew Charles was incompetent
they paid tax since the palace fire
From the beginning of time history in this world just repeats itself.... therefore something will happen people are not going to take the Abuse and BS no more!!!!!!
I am amaed how much Charles earns or is given each year including private homes he canand does tac. Millions selling bits of seabed for windfarms is just the tip of their nincome and the arrogance of him - don't get me started
The total corruption of PA and his greedy wife was known by the late Queen, who refused to have them investigated. Read 'Entitled'. Charles is given £1m in a paper bag for citizenship? Mountbatten has a children's home in N.Ireland trolled for victims of his paedophilia. The RF is a model of anti-social greed which we shld be revolted by.
Cromwell
He needs to be dethroned. He is worthless.
100percent on it
His parents were pedos I heard them on utube during pizzagate it’s true all the heads of countries are that is what they want your children
The king's a joke,The queen knew it.why you guys still give these ppl your hard earned money.Boggles the mind.Royalty are truly worthless bottom feeders.
Totally disappointed with the King ,Im a veteran I never thought I would say that ,no wonder the late Queen stayed till she died  she knew what he would be like.
Fake clickbait headline. He's not "exposing King Charles," he's railing against monarchy generally.
As to the Saxe Coburg comment…..I am constantly horrified by comments by people who should know better, about the ‘Windsors’. I get thing like…..we need them….??..they bring lots of money into the country. Indeed, an awakening is overdue. However the Referendum idea worries me… I think people would vote to keep them. The Press kowtows to them. It is sad. Julia..
i think this man is ex royalist. ha ha
Charlie and Kate both have cancer but neither has any side effects? Why have they not lost any hair.... what treatment do they get?? Purely a cynical publicity stunt!!!
I can NOT stand the wretched traitorous royals
Guillotine....
Thot they were german eh Battenburgs and play soldiers
Just how did you "expose" him?
Hes absolutely 💯 right ✅️ 😅
😂😂😂😂😂hell9 Gourgeous family's 😂❤❤❤thank you wow 😂❤❤
Why  everybody's hurts each other enjoy malicious action evil enjoying destroyed humans why's 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
We not here's 😢for destroyed anybody peopel ok it's trued to understand our world 😢
Reptilian 😢❤thank you its very sad lady Diana say ots a show that dgat the world6like family fairytale 😢distractions for her families rituals bumanos
The monarchy died with the queen
Never listen to these brainless ugly zionist funded fake "British patriots"!!!
Long live King James!  VIVAT REX CAROLVS I  Bring back the Stewart's.
Wee bit German lairdie TRAITOR!
A redundant monarchy serves no purpose in this day and age. It has become patently obvious. They are wealthy parasites who serve no function whatsoever.
Truth.
Battinburgs  bloody Victorias kids fighting each other. Windsor’s my arse. Royal , your joking.
Go back in history and see if our Royal Family are actually true English im curious not sure
Charles is dark side. Always has been. His energy alone contributes to the dark frequency. All he has to do is stand there.
IS perhaps "JOE"  ex  IRA ?
They are the lizards.
I don't think they would last long on a council estate.  Take their protection away, and you will see what us plebs really think of them. Like starmer, they can only go to well choreographed events with hand-picked guests, or at the very least, they will be told of how we really feel. Get them out now !
I would be carefull criticising the rojal families.. they are the impunity. The rulers of the state.  The king is te highest freemaison in the UK.
His coronation should spell the end of the Commonwealth.
How abouts we elect a new royal family or just a new king ... I vote Tommy Robinson
We all now know the truth,  he is a Muslim, and being the defender of the Christian faith he must therefore go,
That arrogance they carry around is demonic
WOW! NOT SURPRISED...IS SHAMEFUL. MONARCHY NEEDS TO BE ... COMPLETELY... ABOLISHED... COMMONWEALTH COUNTRIES ...NEED TO COMPLETELY SEVER TIES...WITH UK MONARCHY...WITH THESE... CORRUPT W-NKERS!!  USING/&ABUSING THEIR POSITION, POWER, AUTHORITY, MONEY, AND RE$OURCES...COVER UPS OF THEIR CRIMINAL ACTIONS, HISTORIES, AND LEGACY. MONARCHY GOVERNANCE...IS A SICK...JOKE!! THEY ALL NEED TO ROT...IN THEIR ...RESERVED PLACE ..IN HELL.
FKING WANKERS!!!
totally agree
So you call the British people peasants nice
Same old tired rhetoric
The devil is having his day. He has his people in all the highest offices. Here in the States our government is saturated in corruption. God help us all. 🌹
Cromwell might have had a point
The Queen paid tax.  I suspect Charles will as well.
Make Europe Christian Again 👇🏻
He is a disgrace to the UK. He is basically giving England away to the Indians.
KING CHARLES IS USELESS
Punk music and comedy was engineered to divert people’s anger at royalty into an emotional limbo.
Iman Charles needs to go ...
So many medals and awards for doing nothing 😂
Even the hard-core royalists are finally waking up to them.
Never ever have I understood why anyone would give a shit about the royals . When Diana died the news went on and on and on , who gives a shit . When you or one of your family dies the only loss to the royals will be the overtaxation they'll lose out on . They won't give a moments thought about you , so why suck up to them ? Vermin
Well said.. and done... Respect to u.... I've always said it ..they most corrupt fuckers ... Fuk the king
I agree, Charles is unfortunately very WEAK  - hope he does not over stay the 5 years  the late queen said. She knew he does not have what it takes to be king! Plus as for "that other woman" no respect for her at all !!!
Not my king he needs to go ......what purpose is he serving NONE
The hilarity of it all is that all that savagery for thousands of years stealing raping pillaging & incestuous marriages. The most absolutely weakest muslim apologist representative is now their leader.
These arguments are silly.  The french got rid of their king and have had 4 revolutions since then.  Constitutional monarchy is probably the most stable form of monarchy ever to exist.  This is silly, no thought put into it at all  just base materialistic arguments.
We could do with another cromwell indeed! Ive never liked the royal scroungers!!!
King of the PDFs. Fraud courts to traffic children.
Fancy calling this spoilt brat al king oh please
His mother was a Gangster...  Never liked her....Leach
All Leaches   The Royal Family!
HES NOT MY KING. JESUS IS KING. THEY ARE A BUNCH OF DEMONIC INBREDS THANK YOU FOR YOUR CHANNEL HON
🇬🇧 I record the coronation , I couldn't bring myself to watch it, he's not liked , or her , I deleted it. Can't stand looking at him, never watch him on Christmas day, or his late Mother, even though I liked her. He's not my _____. 👑 He  stole the crown, from William, he should have stepped down.
for sure needs to give back the money
King Charles is a traitor to he’s country and to he’s mother and father
The Union Jack and the St George’s flag isn’t just the flags of Great Britain it’s the kings flag the flags of royalty but King Charles is excepting the police arresting people showing there loyalty to king and country for flying them,he’s excepting illegal immigrants tarring them down perhaps we don’t need or want a monarchy anymore
Same as Andrew
Yeah n u took the queen's shilling... And were prepared... And trained.... To kill whoever u were told to....??????
Spot On Mate
Spot on! Ive never been or had any allegiance to the monarchy, they are not needed now or past, get rid of them,open up the palaces as hotels,rich people will pay a fortune to spend a night in the kings bedroom, biggest tax dodgers of all, france and russia got it right in there revolutions, they cost us millions and give absolutely nothing back! Yup i totally agree with what your saying!
If Charles really was a King he would have already dissolved parliament
Agree with you completely,  I have the same thoughts, ashame the Brits don't see through them or even the commonwealth as a whole!!
Well said Sir! Not my monarchy. I'm sick and tired of paying for these grifters to live a life of luxury while the rest of us struggle. Look at the current crop of comedians, most of them know more about quinoa and Michelin restaurants than social struggle. Where's the Alexei Sayles, Ben Eltons, Jo Brands, spitting image etc? the establishment in this country were roasted by this comedy daily, I can't think of any mainstream comidian doing any real political/subversive material in last 10/15 years? it's all middle class slightly posh kids now who haven't really got any issues other than where to park the car and finding the nearest pret a manger. Don't get me wrong some of them are funny but zero angst and no bite, its another symptom of what this gentleman was describing.
Only if uk become a republic which has happen before and we have 1st amendment minimal …. Can’t be any one who rules who does not have invested interest in lands and people for generations …. The lose the wealth money power made if go to another country …. Has to be rules that make sure there  integrity fairness and righteous … not sure how but we need to think what would make sure all who have power are not bought men
Nz doing the same,Luzon the pm saying needs holding nz back so getting foreigners to buy houses,no jobs,expensive food,rates etc,bent cops,bent judicial system,bent cps,or social interference,lawyers.
Sum it up perfectly,  waste of space, and money, let’s ditch them and save ourselves a lot of time, money and trouble.
❤
The British Royal family gets away with everything same as people gets away with things if they know people in higher places. Also Charles is a pedophile jimmy savile
WE AMERICANS  are with you THEY ARE THE BIGGEST FAMILY OF MIGRANTS( They are of German Descent not ENGLISH) Second they are the BIGGEST WELFARE FAMILY EVER TIME FOR THEM TO GO From the USA 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
You lie because you got fired 😂 stop lieing
What a great video! I wish I’d found it sooner. I’ve never understood this misguided loyalty to these parasitic leeches. They care absolutely nothing for us whatsoever! The Windsor mafia is the most apt quote I’ve heard in a long time.
Dose the so called king know he's on the Muslims hit list 😂
All those medals he's like a dictator with his medals
IF he CARE FOR THE VETERANS WHY ARE THEY ALL SLEEPING ON THE STREETS AND ALL YOUNG MEN WHO SHOULDN'T BE IN THIS COUNTRY PUT IN HOTELS ON UK TAXPAYERS MONEY WHEN THE VETERANS SHOULD BE IN THE HOTELS NOT PEOPLE WHO CAME IN BY WITH KNOW PASSPORT OR PAPER????
we're still waiting for him to go he only cares for what comes in by 🛶🛶🛶 him & his son William is with the WEF BLACK ROCK EU BILL GATES ARE MORE THAN THAT GET THEM OUT NOW
Do not mock give real proof of your knowing
He’s a 🐀 no be long till he’s Dead 💀 🫵🏻🤣🤣
Tony Blair gave the late queen ownership of the seabed. Now Charlie receives millions a year from renting out OUR seabed for wind farms etc. No wonder Charlie is in favour of milibands mad ideas
And he never paid inheritance tax £700 million
What about the Peasant's-Revolution of 1381!🤔
History is only what they what you to believe.
So yo are saying William and Kate don't work 🤔 🙄
I have an ex-colleague who after chatting with your King for 5 minutes. Wanted to arrest him and take him in for questioning. Charles the Chump.
Ban the royals
The establishment controlling freaks are on their last final warning people are not going to put up with it anymore it's all over England watch what happens the weekend in London and elsewhere in the country of course the establishment of their paid thugs there to cause trouble but the English patriots have already seen through that we know what you do we're not all stupid
Thanks for info!
Glad to hear this part of the KCIII information! William will be a better KCIII.  Must be sooner than later I hope.
Hoping William is going to change all the problems KCIII has made bad!
Charles is a huge part of the problem. He does NOTHING for the people. He has joined the enemy
Totally agree!
Big ears n camilla could there be a more dispised couple ? How she can sit there gloating wearing dianas jewellery ? Never ever lv yr beautiful kids with her william n kate.
ENTITLED SELF CENTRED SPOILT ARROGANT AND PEOPLE WORSHIP THIS  HEDONISTIC ROYALTY.
Charles is tight with Klaus Shwab and the globalist agenda
APART FROM ALL THAT ------WHATYA FINK OF 'EM ?
Completely agree!! Let them use their own money to pay rent in Government funded palaces….stop sucking money from the public budget and spend it instead on education/culture for citizens -programs for disadvantaged children and training them with skills for work ….make sure every girl and boy leaving school has a Trade ( capable of physically fixing something:contributing to keeping society functioning) EVEN if they don’t work in the area because they take up other jobs/training. Get out ofthe trap of being unemployed because they’re unskilled/traumed/educated. No other Monarchy persists with the Pomp/elaborate self-adulation  as The British do.
There’s no point in king Charles  he is not for his own people and doesn’t care who is coming into the country and taking  over his land and going over to Islam he’s finished get rid of them traitors
Charlie boy and his redhead son are Wankers
All anger anger  leave the royal family alone if you do not like     UK go and live in a mother country like North  Korea or  usa
Thank you sir, from an Irishman.
The ancestry of the "Windsors," Hale from "Germany!!"... Not England!!! The 4 King georges,  All  german, Queen Victoria,(House of Hanover, (germany).... They are as German  as a Kraut... 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
I totally agree they are living in 60 room palaces and exveterans are sleeping on the street, how can that be.   Why are we paying for these people to live rich and have better lives than abymof us, what a cheek.
Charles cannot be held to account for being a royal. What is happening worldwide or in England is not his fault. We are all living in the time of the end, this Satan's system we are living in is coming to an end. The "Last Days' is here. 2nd Timothy 3 verses 1-5  describes the last days.. Critical times hard to deal with....................
Not my King
Charles is the Anti christ
Brainless idiot
waste of space charlie no king
Apparently, if you have not made a will the crown take your money?  I always liked Princess Di, Kate, William, Harry, the kids.  I think they do bring in money to the economy?  I would love to know the researched statistics.
My goodness, are you sure that you are not an undercover  IRA?? You certainly dont look underfed and homeless!  Now if you had a go at Staner and his Facist cabinet.....
Hes a sympathizer i get why queen held on so long lord wish queen was still here the country has fallen since she did xxx
Ugh !
Bloody barrackroom lawyer!
Absolutely spot on, mate.
Well done sir he supports muslims over his own people
He wears medals for what he should  feel ashamed
He is no longer regarded with respect we want him gone abdicate
I admire the history of his royal house. There was a time in history other Aryans viewed his ancestors as low born. Their line is ultimately Saka in origin. They are not descended from Fenius Farsaid, nor Lord Krishna, and, most importantly, very uniquely among Northern European royals... King Charles is not descended from Odin. The Scythians have the highborn heritage, not the Saka/Saxons. I admire his house for starting at the literal bottom of Britain and rising to control the top of it. Everyone likes an underdog. His royal house started as low born cast aways, albeit still in the Tribe of Ares. My Hebrew patriarch married a handmaid, I have a humble beginning on my heritage's beginning, too. God bless us all, and may peace find you well.
Becoming a Republic isn't the answer either. Look at the poverty in the States. Homeless, food banks packed without enough. No universal healthcare. Elderly living on old age income 1k a month with prices 3k a month. Monarchy & Republic are not the answers so what is?
Legend u mate
The fact him and camilla have both been married before when the one and only resl Queen Elizabeth passed away the monarch should have have bypassed him and went to his son William and the fact that wrinkliy whore Camila was made queen is an absolute crime and a kick in the face to every British citizen that should never of been aloud.. So to me the royal family died when Queen Elizabeth died...
Been saying this for years !!! So good to hear you say this !!
I'd like to become a Canadian citizen, but I'm not sure I can swallow loyalty to a king.
He is pure evil
This King Charles needs to be voted out by the people, he is no better than any king Charles before him, he is perhaps the worst of them all, execution is too good for him but voting out the end of the monarchy is the best thing here,
Charles is not fit to rule a chicken coop. He is a cad, a scoundrel and a greedy narcissist….screw the British royal family
The royals are german!
The royals are shape shifting reptilians!
There is no need for a monarchy! Who don't support it's people and it's  culture, built on Christianity.    Rama! dama! ding dong
Wow I just found this video and I have said for 20 years there the ultimate biggest gangsters and other than myself your the only other person to say it!
Apparently king Charles is a Reptilian
Great video!  You've got our support!   Were great at throwing Tea Parties! 🇺🇸
The crown is like a parasite draining our wealth away through unlawful taxes. The Union jack represents the British, not the English. The British nationality Act 1947 & again in 1981 under Thatcher erased English, Welsh, Scottish & Irish nationalities. This was unconstitutional. People don't know who they are. The British don't have a constitution & therefore no rights. Charles has effectively abdicated because as mentioned by Lord John Summers, who became Chief Justice Holt said "he has purged his oath by his non action over taking possession of the realm" as per the Glorious Revolution. England is 1100 years old. He is allowing the country to be run by a tyranous regime of beaurocracy & we the sovereign people have the right to take the country back into our own hands using treason as the reason.
You are a disgrace.
This is 2 years old and I have just seen it……. Thank you for educating me on they subject to which I agree on all you have said.  I can’t see the monarchy being around in a hundred years time but time moves on and people are scared of change. Same with the government same old party’s with out dated policy why be for king …when once you have left the military and can’t survive they leave you , yet if you come on a boat it’s a different matter.  Why isn’t there a service for ex military to go into ie security service , for the sate ….. my thoughts are Britain isn’t grate any more.
They plundered the world, and are still living off the plunder
The problem with King Chuck and the royals is that they are not putting forth the interests of their subjects.
Christians in uk r being arrested charles...defend the faith
That is why all have a military academy, education. To sell weaponry 10% commission one needs a military education. Billions plus
Yep Gangsters and Child abusers
Everything you have said is 100% right they are an extravagance that this country can’t afford the sooner they all go the better the queen was no different she was better at hiding it he and his clan are all parasites
The royal family are a bygone era which as a country we must get rid of as we are constantly sliding down the world scale you only have to look at other countries who got rid of their royal families like China the USA France Italy they are a joke.It amuses me when they say the royal family is a British tradition…… look at that last word TRADITION it specifies old,meaningless,not for this era,we should be moving forward not lost in past centuries.China when it had its equivalent of the royal family in its jade dynasties and Ming dynasties all they did when you read up on them was just to drink and have sex parties AKA prince andrew REPUBLICANISM is the way forward people
THANK YOU, GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT. I'VE BEEN THINKING WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE WORSHIPING EVIL INBRED THUGS. I'M IN MY 80s AND IF I COULD MAKE IT OVER THERE- OVER THERE, MEEE AND MY ROLLATOR WOULD RUN AT LEAST ONE A THEM PISSANT M. FERS OVER FOR YOU. GOD BLESS YOU ALL, GOD BLESS YOU ALL
At least Catherine Princess of Wales is British and mixed with the late English Diana Princess of Wales blood, the future heirs George, Charlotte, and Louis are mostly of British heritage.
The cancer will get him soon but after Charles his son William will have to look for another job as Charles has destroyed the monarchy he prefers Islam to Christianity told lies at the coronation he is no keeper of the faith well not the Christian faith anyway
We need more people like u ,I don't think William should be king the only royal that's true is harry
We don't need them better off without them
Charles should abdicate y take prune face Camilla with him?!They as good as killed Diana!
Charles & Camila should never be allowed to marry & become monarchy.  Abdicate like his uncle with Wallace Simpson .
The Royal family are traitors
I would rather Ali G run the country at this point
They need to lead by example, kings in  history used to be in the front of their army setting an example to fight for your country, these Cee U Next TuesdayS are lazy and have connections to the real wrong people
Cromwell what’s the most evil demonic piece of human excrement God ever managed to create?
What you don’t understand is a royal family are the marketing arm for the bank of England, which controls everyone globally they are the curse and the plague upon the Earth, and they always happen and look to those who started the Bank of England and who have consistently controlled the whole financial system of the world and they’re still in place and they are still the onesthe shots the family like others like politicians are merely puppets doing their bidding so they can hide concealment like cockroaches hiding in the dark
Yeah, what was that convenient that you’re not allowed to convict them or hold them accountable the only way this ends for all of us is that French model and we all know what we’re talking about that’s the only thing that’s ever worked through the history on the slaves rise upis more of us than there is them and believe me they fear you. They just use propaganda to control you to convince you there’s nothing you can do and nothing could be done and just go back to your slave work.
Former British soldier now Russian asset?
We need another olive4 Cromwell a lord protector ant Middleton will do
Well you were certainly right !
Chameleons master of pretenders
It is bothersome that England thinks it needs royalty.  LEARN SOMETHING from the USA.   WE WERE GOING TO BE A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE POWER OF A UNION --  LINCOLN jacked that all up, or should I say the bankers jacked that all up? You left the EU just as the South left our Union.  We are 50 NATIONS and should be 3 or 4 unions by now.   BY THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE,  not the GOVERNMENTS.   What is the purpose of royalty?  It's so Roman Catholic.  Is this a Church of England thing?    THEN WHY IS king Charles a bigger fan of ISLAM than he is of Christianity?
Sausagefingers I.
Need referendum 😮
Can not stand the royals expeclly saugee fingers Charles they are vile tratior s
The CoE needs a proper Christian at the helm
I hope that a million moths both infest and eat his prayer mat.
We know now why King Charles the third rhymes with turd💩
Republic Britain is the way forward.
I was once told that everyone who entered the palace was vetted scrupulously, so how come Jimmy Saville was able to visit the Palace so many times? Surely British intelligence should have been aware of his behaviour
He’s not my king !
Thank you .your so so right,    the  king is a traitor.  BIg time.  The queen didn't want him as king.  Nor did I.  They are a disgrace to our country.  🐍
The French had the right idea
They haven't stayed on top by being nice.
I am that real royal family queen isabella of scotland. I've been made homeless and corruption is all over me they are killing my whore family with doubles I am a & b =  o blood type... I'm having to exile to the cult village in Scotland highlands. They ritualized on us  They are Embezzeling money to Switzerland.  Emily Longley death pages.  They have set  me up and stolen my  children more then once they are killing my big sister eileesha jan Adams Collins and taking hers.  I am a movoigian.  They own nothing
Brother would love to talk about the king with you god bless
Stolen valor at the highest level 🎖️🎖️🏅🎖️🏅🎖️🎖️
That's all your opinion,  I admit Charlie's isn't my favourite since our wonderful Queen passed, but mate you can always go live in France or an other Republic. I'll help u pack
You can see why the queen wouldn’t hand the crown over to Charlie. Waste of space. His mum would be turning in her grave
The British monarchy absolutely DISGUSTS me. The pompousness, the entitlement, the luxury given to them on silver platters, the "I am so important you have to call me 'Your Majesty' and bow to me", the way their loyal subjects have to serve them hand and foot. It's revolting!
Doht think a lot will go
The British Monarchy was usurped by imports from the Netherlands and Germany within recent history. It's all there,  read it.  The Windsors had to change their name from their German Sax Coburg Gotha  to English ( Windsor ) during the First World war.  The change was a political move created by some mandarin in the civil service.  They are about as English as Vladimir Putin and yet the gullible population are continually fed propaganda to make them swallow this so called unbroken line from antiquity.  Balderdash, they are political interlopers and  should be dethroned and banished or at least made to earn their corn like the true British have to.
Pimp Charles is an evil person
And then its just lost amongst the many distractions. On and on and on.....
The people are there to serve them and it should be the other way around they should be there to uplift  the people  . But the fact is they are evil 😈 and ruthless so they will destroy you before they give up contral . That's what we are seeing 👀 now the destruction of your country by emigration  . This is warfare but the people don't see it for what it is !
Royal reptilians
He also gets 10£ per ton of gravel tacking form English channel  with 16 ships landing  8thousend ton a wek each thats alot of tenners tax free hes allways been the greatest royle and he loved being  on the royal navy?????;;;;; he even tried  to sell all our butifull qweens horses  ass it was  cost to much to run but was advised not to sell factbfact
Ps I have a "claim to fame" here - my Cavalier Ancestor assassinated Colonel Rainsborough in what is now the Wetherspoons in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. He was hung , drawn and quartered for it. Maybe on the wrong side of politics for me but it's a gripping swash and buckle story ( took place over a four poster bed - very Errol Flynn) !
Sue Townsend (Adrian Mole author) wrote a hilarious book called "The Queen & I" imagining the Royals being placed in a council estate following a Republic revolution in UK.
Couldn't agree more.
We should have a referendum on this RF
💯 your correct fella
There's too many people with a vested interest in the monarchy to let it fall. A line should have been drawn after the Queen passed away. It's odd that Labour are happy to perpetuate the monarchy, maybe they are seduced by the honours that are bestowed upon them, SIR Tony Blair being a prime example, rewarded for what?
Not interested either
Correct ….
@DoubleDownNews  Nevertheless,  England, Scotland and Wales are still part of the Holy [ Roman ] Empire of German Nations, and, even after there has been a series of usurpers who want to propose otherwise, they are monarchies.

Well done. Yes, yes, Yes. True be told.❤
Excellent! Truth as to come out, it's been long enough!👍👍
If that’s the case my friend, why did you sign up to serve Queen/King and Country?😏
Well said.  Scrap em
Is treason not an offence anymore.
Don't bring down your King. Very bad.
Abolish the monarchy. We don't want them or need them.
King Charles is an anti British traitor. Not my king and not our king.
Yes they are, and think more of people from other countries than British people and UK, look what he has done, nothing,
I wish King Charles would go away and his trolling with him
I get what your saying but train drivers earn £35k a year minimum , what about people that are earning minimum wage at £12:21 an hour ? That’s the people that are struggling having to pay travel to work then bills then they struggle to live not train drivers or rail workers they receive a good wage I’d love a £35k a year wage
I remember growing up in London (as an American) very fondly, except for going to school and asking questions about the monarchy (as a year 4 or 5 kid) that directly led to me being suspended for 2 entire weeks and not understanding, what i did. The concept of a monarchy was alien to me and i was trying to understand their place in British society.
He wants to be reincarnated as a tampon, I rest my case.
Be careful what you whish for. The King, who once only answered to God, but these days, I think the monarch, is a subject of the global monopolist.
It's amazing how many people do not know anything about the WEF.  Old Liz honoured Klaus Schwab and Charlie launched the WEF while Mummy looked on. The old Queen was a lot smarter than Charlie and all the fools remember her fondly. I can't stand any of them at all. Not one.
What happened  to.labour for a Republic.policy etc...we need a proper labour party!
Why can't we be a  Republic now
Is there ONE thing Charles has done since becoming KING that has improved his Subjects lives?
He is a Muslim so he's not the king of the UK he is the to the Muslims 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Baby watch Jacob ROTHCHILDS We are the founding family of Israel then watch THE DARKSIDE OF THE ROTHCHILDES ROTHCHILDS ..150 years of inbreds
🇯🇲 is becoming a Republic 😅
WE DONT NEED THEM. There is only ONE KING… Jesus Christ, He is coming again to set up His Kingdom.
The wealthy people are of  the elites.We are stuck in a false reality .
Type 'khazarian mafia' and you will know everything about this family
They are not even English they are khazars (Turkic Mongolian)
People go missing or have bad things happen to them when they disrespect those in authority. Please be careful what you say and post after all you are talking about the king of United Kingdom! The kingdom which colonised 90percent of the world. Do you think they are sleeping or have taken their foot of the gas? Please am saying be careful for your own good.  Pray to God. Only God can help. Bless you all. One love ❤️
If you want to live in the USA. The government takes  a lot more money than the royal family. And they pay Taxes. How about you.
The deal between the upcoming capitalists and newly rising oligarchs and the monarchy was sealed in 1688. An important piece of history known as "the glorious revolution".
Abolish this bad comedy,  Will "horrible histories" make a sketch about this in the future?
We need a Republic, .
If they bring in tourists, let the hotels pay for the Royal Family. I regard them as a bit like Coronation Street, some people find them entertaining, but that’s no reason why we should all pay for them!
Are you talking about just a bad king or do you mean The Thone the very Throne itself you want to Abolish
He’s far far worse than you could ever imagine, just filth.
I hate the monarchy but I fundamentally disagree with this well-spoken fantasist. French revolution was a freemason and jew run operation that screwed up the country. The French monarchy of the time was infinitely more propeople than the pedophiles in Buckingham Palace. And another thing is, the idea in defence of democracy with such lying media is futile. Thanks for pointing out the problems but having proposed no real solutions. You live in the clouds.
I couldn't agree with you more. 👏🏾
❤agree
WE USED TO BE  ROYALIST  MONICAST  BUT AFTER OUR GLORIOUS QUEEN DIED  THIS NEW woke king??

GET RID OF TH MONARCHY  THERE SPONGING  OFF THE STATE
Buckinham palace would make a great hotel. I left because I could see what was coming, but if things kick off for real and not just a load of hot air then I’ll come and help. In the end violence solves everything if no one’s listening to dialogue.
Thank you Mr.Glenton.👍🏽👍🏾👍🏻👍🏿
May The Almighty Bless You for speaking the truth.The RF would never be happy alway turmoil in their family,some would say they're cursed because of all the crimes committed to Africa. They are imposters, posers, with something that does not belong to them  people are waking up to the truth.
Did u swear the soldiers oath of affirmation u renegade
You're dreaming if you think you're taking back the land that is rightfully yours.  IT"S NEVER BEEN YOURS.  Never not once. Went in British history did the land belong to the people?  The Neolithic maybe. You have never gotten the land out of the landed gentry and your government is a Juggernaut that can't do anything.  Good luck mate
If you really think that overthrowing the monarchy will put money in the nurses  pay packet you are totally naive
So outdated. Such inequality. Millions have nothing or very little. Time for a Republic!! So overdue!
Ffs train drivers are not scrimping.
Too many people say square when I know it’s a triangle.
type in :- The Heretical Press Petition to the Queen 12 noon 7 Feb 2001.
He cares nothing for British 🇬🇧 people.
Wasn’t it said reported and filmed of the younger Queen Elizabeth during the Second World War she was seen helping, contributing her services.  The young Elizabeth seen helping by mechanical fixing, repairing engines of service jeeps for their military including helping in other sectors during the war.  Not sure of King Charles what type of wars-military services he took  part in, to deserve all those medals 🥇 like the many not sure what the medals worn not singling the King out but overall what are most of the medals earned by soldiers that receive them. Guess should google, look up medals find out what each one is for
Well said sir,
It’s true but it’s also true in other countries where there is no royalty there all the same
Has King Charles converted to Islam?
You’ve spoken with courageously expressed your truth about MONARCHY LIVING LAVISHLY LIFE ON TAXPAYERS MONEY. AND FUCKING DOING FOR THE COUNTRY BUT DISGRACED THE BRITISH REPUTATION BY BETRAYED  TO UNITED KINGDOM CITIZENS TRUST.  ONE OF THE WORST MONARCH OF BRITISH ISLES.
Oxygen,,Thieves,, 😂😂nothing,,but
This ,,GUY IS A LEGEND,,❤
0:57    The french model didn't work for France either. Both countries are facing the same problem.
You have a lot to learn about diplomacy.
Yep, you'll disappear and the other you will return. Well said though. I stand with you.
How true. The monarchy has no idea about what the ordinary citizens go through.  Shame on them.
❤ WELL SAID SIR !!!❤
The trouble is that the Deep State Elites own the Arms industries, and also the souls that 'get elected' so it is in their interest to wage wars nowadays. All wars are bankers wars! Now in UK they are stirring friction with Migrants in hotels. Then recruit 'soldiers' to shoot and kill on both sides and contribute to the population reduction programme. Some young man put a video of himself telling from a travel  lodge where uniformed men left a crate  and box in the courtyard and a list of Arabic names of hotel residents. So he and his mate opened the boxes and found firearms, hand grenades and boxes of bullets. The report was taken down quickly. This is probably happening in many 'Hotels'. A bullet at my age(71) in the head for me is kinder than the slow death that has been imposed on me by the Astra Zeneca Covid19 vaccination. 5G towers cause cancer so be warned. That is why they put them in high rise crowded neighbourhoods. I started feeling giddy when they nailed 'boxes 'to the old telegraph poles in my road and I have a detector that shows the power goes up high after 11pm until 7am when most are asleep and not on the internet. Pray to God that the evil deep state be got rid of.
Correct. The royal family are the most vile criminals. It's time they paid. They must fall.
That thing is not a king arse
We know these people are Satan children.
Double Down News is Socialist with all the injustice that is associated with  socialism from the French Revolutionaries through to the socialist governments of Spain, Italy and Germany in the 1930s and 1940s.
Edmond Burke provided the philosophical  imagination to see the evil in the French Revolution.
Charles is not my king. He should have abdicated, like Edward . There you go one rule for one, but not for another. Same as two tier policing.  Parliament or king, not both. He is worth billions, he lives, surrounded by luxury and opulence and acts like a spoiled, peevish child, when he feels thwarted by a pen!😂😂😂😂😂
Check history your King Charles already sell him Scotland
Ideological ass licker.  Monarchy and empire are finished.
The problem is a simple one.  The present constitution of the UK is flawed in every respect. It offends every aspect of reason, logic, and functionality - until you consider any of the alternatives.  All of them are that much more hideous.
Search Kevin Annett....  You don't know the half of these Heretics.
The Family of Tudors,have a look at that Mob , they would look across the table a thier family siblings etc working out how to kill them to gain the inheritance,and they call blackfellas Barbaric 😅.
Your country needs a civil war or it's people are doomed
What a brilliant speaker, absolutely true
That Charles is an absolute joke, I've always thought the way you have, But morons won't listen 😠
More like king chuckles the clown
Can’t stand the clown.
They really don't care about their people. Really king Charles do you expect us all to have nothing and be happy, while you sit in your castle. 🏰 How Sad! 🤥👀⚖️⌛ I haven't forgetton how you deceived Diana. That say a lot about your character?  Not one who has respect and honor. 🤬
I am no longer a fan of traitor charles
Sounds like an angry poor man who thinks the world owes him some shit. Cry more, cry baby.
KC should remember his namesake KC1... Did not end well
Stop paying taxes u slaves.yes I’m insulting 60% of you. 40% I’m sorry and I love you guys I’d be in the same boat, I can just actually say something and I’m self aware of that
Did you just not pay attention in school? I got taught about Cromwell and the royalists and the rise of the parliamentarians… fact is these days, both are very out of touch and shouldn’t be governing us… we should have democracy where the people of the country choose the laws and actions of the nation, not pick who makes those decisions
All the Royal families all they are is gangsters from time began. They took the land because they had people behind them to help them and they exploited the poor to pay taxes to make them rich. It’s pathetic how we still have this type of people today Kings and Queens of whatthey are rich layabouts.
Imagine Charles being the defender of the Christian faith 😩 that’s embarrassing in itself!! It seems like the elite are just letting the Islamist take over y’all country!  I pray that doesn’t happen because I’m sure y’all are very good people, no one deserves to bring weighed down by that death cult.
Cromwell was a Puritan. Do you want to bring them back? I'm ni favour.
Not my king
As a French, your description of french people had me giggling. 😆😂😂
'Charlie 3'. The true meaning of useless freeloader.  You know, I think the French were on the right track in 1789.
He aint no fucken King 💩💩💩
I don't understand why you Brits are even following a king. You would be better off taking control of your country from these criminals that are running it take back the royal properties which have been stolen from the people anyway and do like America and elect somebody to run your country every 4 to 8 years that way when they turn out to be terrible you can just vote them out of office. And that's exactly what you should do with starmer. I watched the elections over there and I seen starmer and I told my wife I said this guy's a liar and you watch he's going to be terrible and he's going to do exactly the opposite of what he said. It looks like I was not wrong. Why should England send their children off to Wars and never come home and then have a leader that gives it away to your enemies. You're a liberals talk about our president with disrespect but I guarantee you he cares more about our Americans then the 25 presidents we've had here and he really cares about the British people and for some reason your liberals just can't see it.  I am just so glad that we booted your king out of our country back in the 1700s and you see how great a country can be without a majestic ruler you call Majesty. The only Majesty you should be worshiping is God and not Islam War Kings.
French here: I totally agree with you on the Royals. Every time I hear Charles Camilla Ann and the others « work hard » I always die laughing. Their driver takes them to some hospital, school or wherever in their Rolls Royce or Bentley, they cut a ribbon, say a few platitudes,  shake a few hands to show they’re close to the people and go back to their castle have tea. Give me a break with their “hard work “. Those insanely privileged entitled brats are sickening. And don’t start me on Charles encouraging Islam and Muslims in your country. He’s completely nuts, the traitor. I m not even English but I feel for you people.  Unfortunately, our situation is no better in France.
The Bourbons, the Romanovs. People got sick of them.
Yet takeaway monarchs, always those that should not have power, the ones aspiring it. By deception and/or force. Better a good absolute monarch or dictator with good advisors, than a democarcy with a majority of fools.  Look at US, what does a presidential system, not taking in acount the robbery and foolery of those posing as their representatives. Yave sugested a statue in front of their work places guilotine concept,  to remind them daily to serve those they should. They deceive with way to much confidence these days, not afraid of consequenses for betrayal and their collection of wins. Instead together they laugh and scam on with little fear ending up at the town entrance hanging as example for the n3xt that might get any ideas. We are united fruit company mentality couped societies and have been for a while. Just this millennium it shows so clearly. Yet nothing, to the point I think, deserved and do not look at me, for Imwalked the walk amd talked the talk,  but y'all "knew better" and dismissed what I had seen and lewrned, kept feeding the monster as if your friend. Well,  enjoy! As I have also seen what they had done to others. They will to you and your children just the same. Just keep giving them the fruits of your intelect and labour, somth3y can use it against you.
The US is a republic ... the public schools try to teach us that we are a democracy but we are a republic
" the worse type of slavery is where teh slaves think they are free" as long as we are forced to pay  taxes we are slaves at least tax slaves
NOT MY KING.  HE LOST ME AT RAMDAN
The overthrow of the monarchy was reversed at the Restoration which is why the Civil War is not as vital as this chap pretends. The Civil War is taught in UK schools despite what he says.
I love the french tradition to cut heads of kings and nobles, it's good hygiene.
I could not agree more.  I refer to the King as Charles the Dull.  The King who sold out his Kingdom to Islam.
Organize in an Alternative Party - Alternative for Britain - AfB.   Complaining without Organization is a waste of time and energy.  The AfB can then put the King into his rightful place - true Defender of The Realm as opposed to Corrupt Servant of Foreign interests.  If you feel the King is hopelessly corrupt, the parliament should make him step down. Then elect his son or grandson (hopefully not yet deeply corrupted) as the New King.  In the end, The People must be politically active, or the political class will degenerate into a bunch of corrupt losers.
If you really think the British King is the problem, I suggest you compare them to Chancellor Merkel, President Macron, absolute King Lukashenko and absolute Kings Putin and Xi.  What you will find is that the Windsors are not the biggest problem you can think of.  Rather, it is an entire political class beholden to Oligarchy/Davos. Including your ELECTED prime minister STARMER.  The Windsors just sail with the rest of the politicial class and do whatever the "others" deem acceptable.
Very well said. we should have a referendum to get rid of them??????
Wrong the biggest gangster's are the government they make the rules and the people who follow them make excuses for them
If your mum or dad pass away and leave you an inheritance,we pay tax on that,Charlie boy paid absolutely nothing,Zero.
William just about to be given another free house in Windsor great park,Adelaide cottage,Anmer hall,Kensington palace and now Forest lodge…..All free
The best off crew on the dole in Britain....
I can’t believe y’all still have a king in 2025. How embarrassing. Y’all should be embarrassed. 😂
Please share this truth far and wide Brothers and Sisters, particularly to those poor saps lining up to serve that dipshit Charles and his mates. 🙏
What's there to expose?  He's always been an out and proud spineless narcissistic fop.
The lizard people are out there...Charles and Camilla are rotten to the core...
The Queen went on as long as she could knowing what was round the corner  SHE  WAS RIGHT =  WOKE KING ON HIS SHIP HMS  TITANIC  HEADING FULL STEAM TO MONARCHY  ICEBERG.
I think the government are pretty good at taking our money ..too
Nail on the head son.  Brilliant the truth will prevail 😂😂
🇬🇧 The parasite class 👑✡️33❌
Charles is a spoilt brat, I mean, who talks to plants ffs 😂
This seems to be even more relevant now, as Charles has shown where his true loyalties lie.
Don’t care about them
The idea of a royal family is so outdated They were protected for years by false media Not a nice family of men there They are fuelled by GREED!!!
Charles is a narcisist like his son and brother Charles is sleazy
I'm Canadian - He's no king of mine.
100 mil could have gone to the pensioners.
MONARCHY IS FAKE.
I swore allegiance to queen and Country, I have nothing in common with a family that entertains child trafficking paedophiles over the decades which The House of Rothschild is all about.
You are so wright I don’t know who you are but I admire you very much. Everything you have said is true. We don’t need any of them. They don’t stand with us. Never have. God bless you darling. X
This is all satanic ....... believe it
Iv said for a long long time we dont live in a democracy we live in a monarchy
Nail on the head buddy 👍
Thank you foryourservice...in ways I guess...?Don't they call Charles 'Sausage  Fingers'? Cromwell  deleted some of my Irish ancestors!

Watching this in 2025 and things are still the same, in fact they are worse.
Islamist
Not my kind
Well said
I have just found this video which is now over 2 years old. I agree with everything you say. As a retired man who left blighty some 40 years ago knowing all of this, I resume that nothing has changed in all of that time. As an ex punk musician I can only blame internet and tecnology for the censoring of  all liberty  of expression. Well done this man for speaking up about the most corrupt british family of all time!
The monarchy died with the Queen
Well spoken mate👍🏻
Born and bred in the Ronda valley in South Wales in 1960 the first thing that we learned was what the crown did to the Celtic people in Wales, SCOTLAND and Ireland,
" Intelligence isnt welcome " 😢😢😢😢😢😢
Not my King he is a WEF traitor and don't care about the British people sorry to say
He's got his clutches in Canada as well and we are suffering because of his minion Carney.
Im American an your so right. Good luck to your country, as ya'll sure need it with who all ya'll got in power.
When you go down the Royal rabbit hole of drug trafficking, satanism and hunting parties .. you see how evil they are
This man is so right! why any one need this weak king to live with the mistress to be come a queen? and live luxury life when the people suffer? why do the UK need them?
Coming from a Commonwealth country, I no longer have the connection I had for the monarchy.
King of what ? He better step up and say let's get the migrants out..
“Inbred morons” lmao 😂
We have actually had 3 CWs,  first ECW 1641-46 under King Charles 1 ECW 2 aka Anglo-Scottish War 1648 under King Charles 2 ECW 3 in 1652 under King Charles 2  Bit of a pattern in this country that any King Charles endes up with an ECW. Just saying.
They were put in by the Rothschilds.
Looks like people are waking up to the gangsters, dictators and parasites. 👍
Charlie is no fkg king !
I would love to see the entire royal family in council houses.  I would love to see all their homes turned over to the government for tourists to tour.  I guess we would have to give Charles Highgrove since he supposedly paid for it but in reality charles has never had a 'job' it's all tax payer's money so Highgrove goes to the government too.  Yes, Charles, Andrew and Anne (she was never in the military) all wear these despot military costumes, with chests full of medals they never earned.
Traitor
I wonder how much money they are worth.  What good is Charles. Hes a Muslim now a Communist.  Does he stop the Muslims take over.  No. He praises them.  Then he invites France, an now they are buddies. Open borders for anyone to come in. Your King is worthless. Thank God i live under my President Trump, an getting the trash out of our country, money back that was stolen , hes for tbe people.  The good people.
Short live the King and his pedo-tyranical regime.
Sickening to see him fawning over the Muslim conquerors of his country
Well said and presented. However,that part of history is not taught factually in schools,many of the public don't know we have a constitution. Parliament oft states Britain does not have a codified or written Constitution). The only means by which both parliament and the Monarchy can exist is by the constitution itself. The Bill of Rights W&M 1688 (particularly clause 7,the right to be armed), Magna Carta 1297 Edw 3rd reissued version in perpetuity ( especially clause 61,to depose the monarch ), Act of Settlement Act of Succession Queen Anne. All this granted us by civil war,"The Glorious Revolution". All this verified in immense detail by Lord Chief Justice Sir William Blackstone in his Volumes, Commentaries on the Laws of England.
The king is, who runs this country? No matter what political party you vote for they serve him.and All the mp work for him this royal family is the reason we are all poorer. They make the decisions.
Monarchy died with queen he’s a traitor and disgrace…
As a staunch Monachist for  a  very long lifetime, I'm sad to say that a certain message came at me today like  a poke in my eye with a burnt  stick leaving me at a stark level of doubt and confusion and disillusion.
NOT MY KING EVER! there is one word for some of them its called  leeches People have short memories and forget he is after all an ADULTERER, Andrew is none better, No wonder Harry is off the rails! at least Ann and Edward seem to be normal people.
How do royals bring in money? They disgust me.
King (not my king) he makes me sick. Islamic fool
You are 100% right
Well said!  Accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior and repent of your sins :)
So, looking at self hypocrisy' WHY DID YOU BECOME A SOLDIER?  Weak, whinner and big chip. Spouting Alt narratives.  Oliver Cromwell's experiment failed in England. Britain does not have a Republican gene. Cromwell was the quick failed product of Republicanism, and decided to obliterate the Irish. Great!
Well said‼️
I am slowly beginning to think the same. What have they done. How many wars have they been in... wearing all those medels
The French model is a disaster. Check out David Starkey.
Ex-Monarchist Christian here from Australia 🇦🇺, I loved the Queen, being 62 in a minute, we always sang “God save our Queen “. The embarrassing sheik in the crown now has always been a whinger, mummy!! Please let me be King!! She knew he was a chicken nugget short of a happy meal! That’s why she worked until she died! We now have the pm who is a soyboy beta male who wears tight stretch jeans and is a dickhead! He’s just come out with your starmerstan and the Canadian pm telling the world that they support a 2 state government for a TERROR ORG.  Like anyone wants to hear what he has to say, he is a grub…..maggot. That conveys my opinion on both parties in this socialist country’s we are now living in!!
I sure like Peaky Blinders though. Thr show. 😅
Well I clicked on this video by accident, but gave it a good listen. I agree with a lot you said, and quite frankly I think Charles III should meet the same fate as Charles I.
The Rothchild's are in charge of the Royals and their the people your going to war for!
Does anyone remember the TV programme in the 70s when the tv Royal Family were sent to live in a council house on an estate?
For me it was when he said defender of all faiths. What a prat he is.
I can't tolerate charles.  The man is STUPID.
The thing that bothers me as an ex soldier is not my oath to Queen and country ( Elizabeth the second was deserving of every word) but the bit about her heirs. I'm glad I'm no longer in the army because I think the present-day members of the royal family are mostly in breach of the behavioural expectations the general public would expect of them. It would take too long to list these aberrations, but anyone could with just a little thought bring many to mind. It may simplify things to remember that a king is someone who's ancestors had a bigger stick than yours. True royalty comes from a lifetime of service to the nation. Elizabeth achieved this. Sadly, her children do not.
100% Agreed Bhaji
What’s crazy He does nothing for the English people, but does everything for the Muslims now that’s a king What needs to be kicked out traitor
What happens to all those grand palaces - let all the illegals squat there? What idiocy. The illegals have taken the money from British pensioners.... what about them
good video
Every last bit of it is a fraud. My fam started Ireland, Scotland, England and the UK all that slave from Africa mess doesn't fly with me.
The sheep are pathetic
inbread morons ha ha ha so right.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It’s the body of Satan against the body of Christ
The way their treating their citzens they might get the same treatment
You are right ,he just signed over Canada and AUSTRALIA  TO THE WHO ,HE OWNS 6,600,000 MILLION OF ACRES OF LAND ALL OVER THE WORLD and their net worth  is almost 600 billion that not his property that we as Canadain have payed them every year for what queen came once and then king came to sign are freedom over to the glob3
Work for NHS & see how corrupted the system is.
All men were created equal!
I’ve noticed that how do very rich have f great hair. Unbelievable! All!!!
Our King is a Muslim and should abdicate. Anne should be our Queen.
And how right you were two years ago… moreso now more than ever….
Grimy tax dodgers 😅
:)
As much as the royals piss us off..apparently they bring in more money to UK then they cost it
From 1 soldier to another, you're right ✅️ . They do F all buy smile look pretty 😅
Their money comes from the Crown Estate, and we don't have a constitution. The land is not ours call them out, but speak openly about what you know.
Two years on I am beginning to wonder🤔
Seems to be a lack of evidence, 'gangsters' ?
IF YOU THINK THE BRITISH MONARCH IS ONLY FOR CUTTING RIBBONS AND POMP YOU ARE VERY MISTAKEN! TO BEGIN WITH, THE MONARCH MUST SIGN EVERY ACT OF PARLIAMENT INTO LAW. IF HE DOES NOT SIGN IT IS NOT THE LAW OF THE LAND. IT IS AS SIMPLE AS THAT.
They've fleeced us for hundreds of years. How are they so incredibly wealthy?? Weren't their ancestors just thugs?? Didn't they just take what they wanted? And was I really born to be another person's SUBJECT...?!? 🇬🇧🤬🇬🇧🤬
I see reports sometime of elderly over there freezing through the winters and they have all this money all these lands properties clothing jewels I mean how could they let their people freeze? It's sick.
As an American I don't know how you guys can do it over paying all those taxes You're even taxed on your TV! That's insane! And it all goes to the royal family for what to throw these big lavish parties for other rich people. They say Oh it's so they can communicate with people no they're just getting all these free vacations they just walk around shake some hands. As an American I am so pssed off finding out where our tax dollars have been going. These people just flaunt it right in your faces. Unbelievable They hate us they hate you They want us gone they think the world should belong to the rich and the rest of us should die so they have more room. Don't forget about the quote from Queen Elizabeth's husband King Philip -"In the event that I am reincarnated, I would like to return as a deadly virus, to contribute something to solving overpopulation".     That doesn't sound like someone who loves his people wants to protect his people help his people. He wants to come back as a deadly virus and kill you all kill all of us. INSANE!!!
💧👃🏻🧤🤢🥴 UM’..ISN’T THAT LIVING ON GOV. ASSISTANT, WELFARE ?! AND YET THEY CLAIMED IT’S THE FOREIGNERS WHOSE TAKING IT ALL.🫢
People seem to forget how close the royal family was to the Nazis. Edward had to abdicate the throne because he was too close to the Nazis for anything to work (taking advantage of) with America. I truly believe it's all the European monarchies including the UK that set up all these invasions into Western civilizations and I believe they are the ones who started all the trans sickness in children and adults. They want to destroy Western civilization. They hate us. They hate you their own people. Remember Queen Elizabeth's husband King Phillips quote- -"In the event that I am reincarnated, I would like to return as a deadly virus, to contribute something to solving overpopulation".
They're  a bunch of parasites you're too right m8, and his brother has been exposed as a nonce,and was grifting off the back of the nation
King Charles discusts me along with all he stands for.
King Charles is a traitor
Your want to kill the king or wish his death your actually lost
Very well said 👍
How many people did Charles fight to achieve all those medals he disgracefully wears on his well tailored uniforms , they have never seen action except at a dinner table
Up the Republic... Greeting from the Republic of Ireland.

Whole family is 🤡 🎪  Nutmeg is a mental patient. Cat was whipped into the 'silence' mould, put in the corner. 👑 never left the basement of her parents. Next 👑 is a home wrecker. These women better not give lectures on women empowerment, strong independent women, etc. One son is a cheater who ☠️💀his wife Other son 🍆 teenage girl, and got slap on wrist as punishment. 👑was more worried about the hemline of her daughter-in-laws than her scandalous sons.  One grandson is a jealous, bipolar ginger cat; the other grandson is a coward who didn't want to protect his fiancee from the media bullying her for waiting too long for marriage. They all flaunt their jewels looted from other continents.  They are not eating food from an honest day's work. They are eating food from public charity, donations and taxes.
To say Britain is crashing - is too generous
ALL TRUE ROYAL WHAT A JOKE 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
king Charles is a traitor to the British people he should give up the crown i would never swear allegiance to him ever waste of bloody space
Yes sir ! It will be nice to see then in a council house.
The fact he's an old out of touch monarch 😂
King Charles is the monarch in our history that will end this institution. Elizabeth II was a great lady, but even so, how can one family obtain so much wealth, have so much power, pay no tax and have no real accountability. Time to finish the Monarchy. Ex- Royal Navy
You are speaking the  unglamorous truth.  The  monarchy is a self serving institution globally.  No man or women is created greater than another.  Ignorance keeps them in their created positions as the public are coerced into positions of deference and fawning.
Well said 👏🏻
The queen changed the status of the royal family from the monarchy to the head of state which is treason!
They have blood on their hands they are Germans not even English! It cost the tax payer billions! They have money abroad which is a crime!  Kastanians check them out?
Hiw can this country have a coronation while the country burns its insane thos is one big farce put on to distract
Not even princess Anne i bet she never even serve or fought in the war ..
THAT MAN IF YOU CAN CALL HIM THAT IS A TOTAL SCUMBAG
DOWN WITH THE TRAITOROUS COWARD KING
Never believed in Kings or Queens.... history proves what they've ever done to make anybody's lives better other than their own??
As an American, I never understood why English people and I guess others, idolized these "Royal" people. It is very archaic.
The royal family in England, and the royals scattered about Europe, are a threat to humanity and civilization. They could put a stop to all of England's current struggles with immigration and wages and pensions, etc.  with the snap of a finger. But they choose to let all these horrible policies continue because they despise the common citizens. They are dispicable. And they created the problems in the first place. And they meddle in the affairs of the U.S. also. That's why they hate Trump...because he has thumbed his nose to them and is putting a stop to them ripping off the USA. They are leeches.
2025 ! So TRUE !
well well well
The United Kingdom in collapse yet our King does & says nothing?? I actually believe this is the end of the road for the monarchy now. Head of our government but betray their own people 😢
Well said. Well done. Thanks for your service ☺️
No wonder, UK is not supporting lsreal. I see now. They are too soft on lslam.
The fledgling City of London's fake ''William of Orange'' was an imposter replacement for the real one who had his head blown off on a battlefield. Nearly all European nobility knew this. England fell after the last civil war ended. The position for a ''King'' was advertised throughout Europe with no takers until the poorest Transylvanian nobles decided they had nothing to lose and the money offered was too much to refuse.
What a dirty, evil traitor King Charles is. Why doesn't he just come straight out and say " Yes, alright, I admit it, I have been a Muslim for many years now, Ok ? "
Trust in God = Allah became Meher Baba, who said = "l am God, evil rulers are reborn as blind beggars."
Packing dates while English 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 girls are raped by Muslims
There is no need to cosplay military institutions in an effort to subsume authority... it can be done by who you are and what you stand for...
Remember remember....
The Canadian Charter of Freedoms states that the Crown, in the personage of the incumbent monarch, owns outright all 'Crown' land in Canada. Canada is 90% Crown land. Oh.....the monarch is also a 'minority shareholder in ALL OTHER LANDS' Meaning that he is part owner of everyone's home, every business, every private land deal. This must change before it brings collapse.
I cannot stand the King! He was rotten to Diana with Camilla in the background! He has lived a pampered, luxury life with servants and sycophants! He has lectured the public on everything whilst jetting around the world! If he wants illegals here he should put them in his many houses and castles in the UK!
He no king , his mother is spinning in her grave. If he was a king , he would take his country back. Teach him English history.   The vikings tried to take england by force , the Muslims are taken over by financially buying off the leadership all over EUROPE
King Charles HATES his own people and Christianity but he LOVES Islam.
I disagree ..I think " we" do need to support & uphold the regent of Prince William and Princesses Cathrine...princess Charlotter & not forgetting the next best thing to a king Prince George..& Our little Louis..installed to be a kid..you can see the King so yes on his grandchildren however the bond,between the 2 sons has brought heartbreak & despicable people that have,no honour ..to marry into the monarchy & you played by your own terms which you refuse the insistence of the late Queen to not be allowed to use the H.R.H & she again broke that vow & still does ..
YES!
Anyone here in 2025? ......it couldn't be more apt.
The only thing worse than a king or an oligarch is a communist.
I know this was done two years ago.  Wow,how spot on are your words right now?
American and Anglophile here.. the current royals don’t seem concerned about the people. Would be nice to see the regular people inhabiting  some of their many properties. Why do they need all of them? Not sure the royals are worth keeping in power but maybe William will be better.
Parasites All royal families
King Inbred
Yes,all Kings are just little men who sometimes have to stand naked.
2025, look at Britain now
3:08 - Well, why should they risk their life when they've brainwashed others to do it?
Throw the Monarchy out and distribute their wealth among the poor.
Would Buckingham Palace and other royal estates be commandeered by the current socialist regime  running the uk.? Maybe it's a case of'better the devil you know' until we have democracy and free speech back, and then we can discuss the monarchy's status.
Yess lad your right hes a traitor and corrupt
💩👑💩
No English royalty since the 1500s
QEII would be horrified with Charles   She set perfect example all her life
Well said

Traitor who calls for the downfall of those who help him.
Look at the UK now . He is spot on ! Down with the royal family 👎
Prince King Charlie wrote  The Great Reset 😢
We don't need a king we don't need Starmer we don't need Labour
oh thank God, I hate these people, even as a kid and not understanding why it all felt so wrong.  I knew nothing about the military until many of them became my customers and wow did they open my eyes, they were so brainwashed, the mention of the queen and they went all stiff like a switch had flicked, their loyalty is so misplaced it makes me sad. They are not human anyway and guilty of so many crimes against humanity! Thank you.
Prince Harry is trying to bring them down
Totally agree,he has to go.   Was my king, NO WAY NOW😡😡😡😡
Sadly I’ve turned against the royals since Charles became king.   He’s part of the cabal and his views are so out of touch with many of his subjects.  He’s sucking up to Islamist and BS on having a tolerance to mass culture and immigration is letting his people down. They’re just a business these days making more and more money from ventures that we the tax payer have gifted them. They have the front to even charge rent to tax funded services such as the NHS and Fire Service for example.   Even more recent history, going back to ww1 & ww2,  shrouds doubts over their patriotism and true alliance with their strong German blood line and also being in the pockets of the Rothschild’s.    I suspect William has been brainwashed by Charles and may very well just the same when it’s his time.    Time for change.
Thanks for the eye-opener
As a non British person, I found it quite revolting to see the way millions of Brit’s are brainwashed by this family, lining the streets in droves, desperate to hand them bouquets and take pics… real peasant mentality…religiously lining up with their mugs and offerings, every Christmas morning outside of the church in Sandringham… waiting for a “life changing nod” from the entitled grifters…🤮
Do do do dont think for yourself...that's far to dangerous...deep independent thinners
Conformist education system....
Dehumanising decent people into believing killing in the name of god and country is a way to make a living..then..once traumatised through war...left for dead..with addictions and homeless..ptsd, drugs, alcohol etc....while still glorifying war using the ((poor))...
A freemason...secret society into sex with children...and their sacrifice
Get them out
Been in army for 28 years and this is shocking show some respect or dont claim to be in  the army
They are nothing more than celebrities
Chales needs to go
I can't stand that Charlie we need Anne for queen
Who worry about this type of BS. He will be dead and gone HAVING DIED NATURALLY!
Safe to say every time there's a new king or queen they're army of protection gets stronger ultimately reaching the point where it is today, king Richard was quoted if he could find a buyer for England he would sell it. Kings aren't for the people, they are for their own. We are just animals on their farm
For Decades the ordinary people of the UK been nothing more than Circus Chimps ...waving a Flag like Numptys  at the biggest scroungers in UK ...and now you find you have been shafted Royally...King Twerp don't like UK...he gone full Middle East...he don't give a Royal snit for UK...he just wants to Cosplay the wierdo
I would not give my oath of loyalty to this clown of a king.!😡😡😡😡
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCgj2UdTGqI this is a man that was surrounded and supported child abusers , not my king
The real kings and queens of British where black.
You’re 1000% right
yeah but, if you get rid of your king , who'll kill the dragons?
CANADA NEEDS TO GET RID OF THE MONARCHY!!
Make William king get rid of Charlie .
Anyone, especially a prince who became a King, who will not, cannot, even show a simple concern for white working class British girls getting gang raped on an industrial level has NO business on any throne! Screw Charles and his boys.
This bloke sounds like he's an arrogant prick!!  He isn't telling us what greatness he has done?? How many divorces has he had??
KC is the problem.  The queen was excellent and William is decent.   Can you say your perfect??
another andrew nonce clone king charles of beastie tha 3rd
Where did you go? I no longer support the monarchy, after Dianna, she was treated appalling by we all know who, and he has betrayed his own citizens and Oath to be the Defender of the Christian faith. hope you are keeping well. As a mum, of 3 son's, one talked about joining the army, thank fully, he has listened to some friends who have left , and advised him not to. God bless. ✝️🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧❤️
King of useless beings, blossom gin drunk,
Its time UK get rid of Monarchy. And put that queen's favourite pedo sex addict in a jail.
The man can’t even dress himself and has someone to wipe his arse I really would love to see him come dawn to our level what a pity full picture that would be he’s definitely not my king
All facts
They are farce impostors not true royals that is why so many main stream populations dont resonate with this falsehood 🏛️🦉🐍🦅🐉🦂⚔️💙👑
The king has failed England
very nice
Abolish monarchy. What the heck are we doing with taxpayers money on pedophiles and adulterers.
100%
He is not my king
How do we get to have a referendum?
Even £ 1/year I would NOT pay for them ! You should not pay for these griffters !!!
Agree with you King Charles isn't a King he's a Islamic cult proxy
Another comunist ...
There dinosaurs 🦕       😂  honestly  check out one of the queens servants and where he used to go with her sometimes late at night
True life story’s
If it was a kiing or queen, that actually would fight for the country that would be different. However, this lot don't care about us the people. They need to go along with the Labour Party
All those medals and he didn't earn one , hypocrite
Down with the muslim King.
Republic Now
Absolutely perfectly put sir 👍👌
Can you imagine Blair as President of British Republic? The form doesn't conceptualises the best of context . Struggle does.
Great review on tampax Charlie vile man. Won’t be missed these inbred morons spot on
The king must fall! Spot on!
That's what we've been saying for 250 years.
They DO pay Tax. I agree that Charles is an abject FAILURE who is controlled by the WEF. But Prince William DOES give me Hope. Would you rather we were a Republic and have Tony Blair as President? As for that traitor Harry who is DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE for the Destruction of our Free Speech and Human rights, he leads the Censorship Industrial Complex via the Aspen Institute to bring in LAWS to silence us plebs. Under instructions from WEF. Charles himself! I would definitely use the French model on Harry and his BARREN Escort from Soho House who stalked and married him. We now have a Slore and two bastards in the RF.  Thanks Charles we couldn’t be happier imho.
Gossip doesn't change the status quo, only faith, prayer, and personal repentance. This gives you righteousness, as we are justified by the blood of the Messiah, for our prayer to be powerful, great enough to take down Principalities.  I like King Charles as a human being, but not perhaps as a King at this stage, as he lacks the valor, honour, and heart that would make him someone you could feel proud to follow. Maybe he will have a lightning in a bottle moment, a change of heart, a change of faith, a change of perception of the world, himself, and the people God has given him to bestow benevolence, protection, and enlightenment on Britain. He is greatly loved by the people around him. Still, something is missing that needs to leave a legacy to walk in greatness with the kings that reigned before him. To elevate the Royal family to the place that took them to power down their bloodline, that conquering force that instills awe and servitude, not for position, riches, and reputation, but because their spirit would quicken in their presence to lift him up in glory and to bow down to God terrified that what was given to him may be squandered.  Athelstan embodied these qualities. Nobody questioned his honour but only their own. This is what it is to be a true King. We must remember that the future hasn't been written yet, for the perception of fate is still ruled in man's mind by his sovereign will, lined up to God's own. What you fail to realise about the Royal family, one of many ignorances, is that its power has been usurped from birth by the Royal Lodge of Freemasonry, which controls their perceptions, what they learn, their values, and the vision of the Royals.  Very much like Wormtongue and  King Theoden - what you don't understand is that his father was heavily involved in the occult, and thus those demons are in his bloodline. The true reality of the spirit realm eludes all of us, even the most pious spiritual intercessors. However, this spiritual knowledge is becoming commonplace in Christian circles that live in the spirit, not the flesh. Many elements change a person's behaviour. This is why it is in Proverbs that humility precedes honour, as this is the vehicle in which we become wise not by merit but by grace practiced and received. If we truly want to serve our country, we need to support  King Charles as he would be a powerful ally once he learns to be a sacrificial King and be filled by the light of the holy spirit that would give him knowledge of all things.
King is a fully paid up member of WEF,, you CAN NOT have 2 masters, BRITISH PEOPLE are well down the list
The Royal Family and the King are crifter and filled with pedifiles.
The vikings were good people
I agree with you double down news today and I saw that you made it two years ago. I am just realising that I have been brainwashed by this country all of my life and I am fifty seven. We were told that Oliver Cromwell was bad and Henry the eighth was good for escaping us from being catholic. At school at the age of eight we studied the vikings at school and we were told that they were terrible rough murders who raoed our women and plundered the churches and killed everyone when they arrived on these shores. I have been reading some books on the vikings and it turned out that they were a bit like that but nothing like they have told us. Alot of them were very peaceful and when they arrived here from Denmark , Norway and Sweden alot chose to stay and marry the local Saxon women. They were very good homemakers and made beautiful jewellery. They respected their women and then worked hard at agriculture and brought up their children well and respected their elders. They also traveled across the Atlantic ocean ling before Christopher Columbus in 1492 and we're in Canada, Scotland isle of man, the north of England and Ireland. The Orkney islands and the Shetland island. Alot of the people there have about thirty percent of viking DNA which proves that they settled there and liked living there. I was reading a book about the vikings written by a professor from Harvard university. I cannot remember his name now. I read this book about a year ago and got it from my local library.
They ground Meghan down with expecting her to do the stuff upper lip business and hold it all in. I know myself. I have lived in France and Spain and they are free.
Meghan could see through the stiff upper lip business that the British are so famous for keeping it all in.
I agree with you. Meghan was a free spirit and a happy person before she  got involved with the royal family. She met harry and they fell in love. They do not like Meghan because she saw through all the bullshit . She is very smart.
I hate the stiff upper lip business. Meghan saw through all the bullshit  and harry got her out of it to protect her. I like Meghan. She saw through it all.
Jug ears is a murderer
Poor Diana knew all the details of the corruption
The royal family are inbred and tax scroungers no wonder the royal family look yampy
They are a blood line, I'm surprised they lasted this long
Your absolutely right as they are griding us into lower state of degree and expect us the british to follow a man whom is demoralising us and its extremely worrying and concerning that we.be got the wrong royal leader when its best if we have other royal leader from another country to temporarly step onot british soil and get the priorities back into persective that will benefit us the british people as charles isnt viable to aviate this country so i understand what you saying and  the in between the lines sir as i do have both my eyes open. What charles has downfalled britain but the british elite us will not give up because of one man making a mockery of liberties.
This man speaks the truth about the inbred Germans posing as British Royalty. They're corrupt criminals, nothing pisses me off more than seeing brain washed idiots waving flags for a member of the Royal family. They look down on their British subjects with disgust & disdain. They won't even know the area & city I live in. They never visit the area has they've time for the area. Unless there's a conflict.
For the many generations, the uk has barely ever put money into infrastructure unless it benefits the perverts of the government and royal family, and we are the peasants in a new era
It is your opinion,go away!!!
The king is blind to what is happening, he has no idea at all . He lives in a world with a handful of people who think they know what is best for hundreds of millions of us. He can never be questioned as he believes He’s always right.
Our royal family died with the queen we need to be a Republic end this obscenity 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
I'm not. he's shite he's letting the uk self destruct the queen would never have put up with labour's shite ŕoyalty is finished I will NEVER  except royalty anymore
I've lived in the UK for 14 years, since I was 18. Worked since day one, paid tax since day one. Never claimed a single penny in benefits, always contributed to society. Always abided the law. Always. I come from a republic. I could apply for British citizenship, but I won't. And I never will. Swearing loyalty to the monarch and kissing the flag during the ceremony? NO FUCKING THANKS. Proud to be an immigrant.
Or use their massive stately homes to help the homeless and needy. They could house the illegals until they are processed.
Charles', BORN a Jew, are you cut??
He’s a terrible person.
Here is what needs to be said. Monarchy is the only God-ordained 'form of government' and 'system for governance' as it is a reflection of The Creator's government in 'the Kingdom of God' and 'the Kingdom of Heaven.' The LORD God is the only One ultimately Whom can enthrone and de-throne a monarch. Now, in the case of 'Charles,' he is NOT a monarch. In order for one to be 'the true and rightful monarch' of their respective dominion, they must be called, chosen, ordained, anointed, enthroned, and crowned 'through the agency of The Holy Spirit.' They must be The Creator's choice, NOT chosen by any individual(s), Parliament, legislature, or the people. No populace under monarchial governance ever chooses their Sovereign! The common people have absolutely no business to ever meddle in or interfere with the actual functions of royal / imperial matters-of-state. Now, the QUALIFIED electors amongst the populace - by the way of Natural Law ("The Laws and God" and 'the laws of nature") - do have the right to make 'a redress of grievances' and make their 'appeals for justice' should their (reasonable) needs and requests require immediate attention. Law and jurisprudence, properly embodied and exercised, allows for the electors to 'appeal to Caesar' should it be discovered that their natural rights were in any way unlawfully infringed upon by any of the monarch's and dominion's officers. The people always have the natural right to be safe and secure in their homes, neighbourhoods, with their possessions and papers, and on their lawfully owned private land. The people themselves also have the right to defend that which rightfully belongs to them, especially including the safety of their persons, loved ones, possessions, animals, and their overall homeland. The people are the nation and their homeland is their country. The country is the land, and the nation is the whole body of the people.   Now, back to Charles. The people of 'the Christian British Empire' have in recent weeks keenly observed that Charles and the Parliament have not kept faith with the Empire's subjects. The British people have expressed their justifiable consternation at the lack of leadership in their government. Damnable heathen foreigners who worship false gods and are murderous Islamic psychopaths have infiltrated and infested British society so much so that England specifically is losing its God-ordained and historic 'English' identity. Overall, distinct British values, separate from the Continent, have seemingly whittled away by this growing overpopulation of irredeemable pagans. And yet, that is not entirely the case. The native British people still retain their identity because they still fight back and fight for that which is rightfully theirs. Yet, they feel powerless and overwhelmed to totally overcome the invaders by a lack of proper leadership to shepherd them. This is why Charles is NOT a King and also why the Parliament is ineffectual, useless, and unnecessary. The legislature has not seen fit to control and patrol the Kingdom's land and seaway borders. A true and rightful monarch keeps his subjects safe and secure because it is not only his duty as 'an anointed Servant of The LORD God,' it is because it is innate and natural for His Royal Person to do so. He could not possibly go to bed and sleep without first knowing that his people are completely safeguarded and that they have officers stationed everywhere to be around-the-clock watchmen.   Now, on the topic of 'the British Royal Family,' more accurately 'the British Imperial House of Windsor,' they are NOT 'inbred morons.' Our Royal Person whom has composed these comments is a legitimately begotten patrilineal (agnatic) Plantagenêt and a maternal (cognatic) Windsor. We were raised in 'the American colonies' as a '[non-denominational TRUE Biblical Christian and We are 'of sound and sound body.' Our biological parents were royal (fourth full-blood) cousins sharing a great many monarchs and other royal personages as their common ancestors. Our Royal Person is four times a legitimate great-grandson of '(Queen Regnant) Alexandrina Victoria' and eight times descending from '(King) George III' with most of those bloodlines not being publicly known. With Our late father's paternal and maternal Plantagenêt ancestry and Our late mother's Windsor ancestry, this allows Our Royal Person to correctly be identified as 'the true and rightful Christian British Sovereign' whom is 'the Christian British Emperor.' 'The British imperial throne' belongs to Us by the way of Our male-preference primogeniture senior-born royal lines of descent. It is under Our rule and reign as an absolute monarch that 'the Christian British Empire' will be restored to its God-ordained purpose and former glory.   All historic wrongs will be set aright, and these initiatives are hereby implemented: (02) 'the Holy Scriptures' will be made available and taught in all public and private schools to properly rear students with wholesome Christian values, (02) ALL taxation (except upon imports and corporations) are outlawed and banned, (03) the overall imperial corporate tax rate is lowered to 7% per annum, (04) all terrorists, murderers, sexual deviants, secret society freaks, and central bankers will suffer capital punishment summarily, (05) foreign invaders will be eliminated by the way of 'severe imperial British justice,' (06) Red Coats will permanently patrol the streets, neighborhoods, ports of entry, and public spaces, (07) prisons will be eliminated as hardened criminals will instead be publicly executed and not perpetually warehoused in incarceration (thus saving billions of British pounds annually), (08) royalty and nobility are permanently forbidden to marry commoners except if they are begotten from a royal lineage that has been carefully hidden over the centuries, (09) the tabloid press and paparazzi are permanently outlawed and banned, and (10) many other necessary reforms.   The time has come for the arrival and ascension of 'Y Mab Darogan' in fulfillment of the prophecy of 'Rex quondam rexque futurus' ("A King once and a King to be"). Do not fret at the present conditions of British society; it was all meant to transpire in these manners so that The Creator can pour out His wrath and so that the Empire can be restored by 'the one, TRUE Emperor!   Pay attention in the coming weeks and months.
AND IS WHY DIDDNT JOIN UP!!

Long Live the King
You're so right Sir ! Thank you for saying what many people think !
Come back Cromwell all is forgiven.
The Monarchy ended with Queen Élisabeth II. Cowmilla is a rat and Charles a nothing - without any skills ! They are profiteering scums !
England should be a Republic with a President !!!  They are end of the race ! Find a job William - il you have enough skills 🤣🤣🤣
100% agree
Brits be careful of isl@mists you may try to overtake you when your monarchy comes back.
Glad I found this channel.
If the people of England 🇬🇧 Don't want to fight for him or the Government  were Fooked.
Why no one talks about the white settlers that settled in Africa and stole everything from the locals and today claim they were here before us😅
A poem  for the Greek Pretender claiming as King Chuck the t3rd. ( I wrote it about me but fits him )  The Pretender  Given all I have done and said Repeating the same mistakes and lies Every book on my shelves I have not read Greedily claiming all as to-days’ alibis Offering up life when I should be dead Refusing to accept even my memories ties Yesterday the only thing I now dread Just because it alone now cries Openly to where it has now led Home and heart too slowly too dies Not able to recall my own true bed Offered to the one who now denies ‘twas ever where she lay her head Faithfully to me the one who sighs Lonely and knowing love can never mend All the pain and lose within my eyes Hopelessly now alone I continue to tread Every moment and mile under the skies Returns me to the now my lies have shred Torn and scattered a moment it buys Yesterdays’ memory now I can only pretend.  11.49pm 26th February 2009  copyright Gregory John O’Flaherty
Just for the record, I do not acknowledge the Greek Pretender claiming the Throne, Crown 👑, Stone, and Sword ⚔️ of the United Kingdoms of England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 Ireland 🇮🇪 including Republic and Occupied Northern Colonies, and claimed Commonwealth; as King Chuck the t3rd. The Pretender he remains. A poem about it ( where’s the plebiscite? ):-  Reclaiming The Stone  They’re back on my case again For stealing The Stone of Scon They say it was breaking the law And caused the Crown too much pain I took it out from under the Throne And left it on my sisters’ kitchen floor Now she has the rightful reign Over all the Realm, hearth and home So I wonder why the coppers are at my door I just thought they had no right to claim To rule all the World alone That was never what the stone was for It was stolen anyway that was their aim They had used it for their swords to hone To take life, liberty and what’s more It was never theirs to use to tame Those that had fair right to protect their own It is now the claim of my fathers’ children for evermore 6 April 2008 Copyright, Gregory John O’Flaherty
We have no real monarchy since king John who forfeit the crown to the Vatican in 1215 we now have a head of state and fact the state does a non entity for something to exist you have to physically touch it or see it otherwise it's a non entity fact. This cancer Charlie is a tourist attraction fact a head of an organisation
The King is no different to any Politician - they are all Power Seekers, like everyone else they all want something for nothing it’s human nature
💯
How many illegals could be housed in Buckingham Palace?
The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Compare Britain and Italy. I as an African does not know or care about whoever is the Italian President. But when the Queen died it was like the loss of one's own grandmother. What this probably good-intentioned man should be doing is campaigning for the reform of the monarchy and better ethics by the working royals, but not its abolition. The monarchy is the greatest contribution of Britain to the world's happiness. And without the monarchy, Britain would no longer be Britain.

Yep
Charles  is in with  the WEF and globalist elites  and loves  muslims  but hates the working classes
I agree and I have even started watching this video King Charles isn’t for the English he sold him self to the hammas
We dont need royalty
As an irish man i never thought I'd say it... but i miss the Queen at least she stood for Christian values
KHAZARIANS
Special friend of Jimmy Saville ❤
Camilla most have her hands full with the work she does for abused women and children with all the riff raff that a certain person has helped bring into the country?
King Queer.
We know and believe you they are evil villains ❤
The monarch are giving knighthoods to the like of sadiq khan who is covering up pakistan rape gangs. Is charles and khan hiding something , are they up to no good together?
Plus he had is children’s mother murdered that sums him up
NO SOUND
Charles is as bad of starmer and the rest of them
Stammer should stop financial aid to ukraine and everywhere else and provide for veterans

BULLSHIT. ROYALTY.
HES AN IMPOSTER, THANKYOU.
Spot on and We see them Treasonous Traitors
Starmer and king Charles are sickening..
Andrew was NOT THE ONLY ROYAL AT EPSTEIN ISLAND,  CHARLES WAS TO ! A KING, NO, JUST A SPOILED BRAT THAT DISTROYED A BEAUTIFUL LADY, THAT THE WORLD LOST, ALL FOR A HAG ! WHAT'S DONE IN THE DARK ALWAYS COMES TO LIGHT !
King Charles the turd. The clues in the title.
l finished with the monarchy when Charlie opened up Windsor Castle for ramadam.The Queen would be turning in her grave.
By picking himself  he hastens their  demise.
Monarchy by definition is parasitic
Dracula family, ingenelment!!!
Double Down News is not dissent. It’s the progressive firewall of the same empire. They catch the awakening left — and send it in circles.  They will never free you. They are there to double down on your imprisonment, but make it feel “ethical.”  Don’t fall for it. Don’t share their content. They are the priests of digital pacification. They guard the gate.
Charles is destroying his Mother's legacy and is a traitor to  the country. Princess Anne must be, so frustrated and upset.  I pray Charles won't lead us into a Republic.
I agree 💯 persent. What is the purpose of the royals. We expect nobility and the royals to act noble and correct, what they did to Harry and Meghan is disgraceful, an abuse of power. They are not relevant anymore because of their own actions.
"king" charles buried any/all ideas about looking up to royals ages ago. It's not just him of course but for the sake of content I will stick to his imperial majesty for one last mention directly addressed to the "king": what actually happened to Princess Diana?
People in Russia didn’t want monarchy any longer so the people fckued them all down the WELL. .??????
Charley has more medals than Idi Amin , what a crock of 🇬🇪🐖💩
They have Rothschild Blood in their Veins🇬🇪🏴‍☠️💩🐖
The fact you have to get personal (fat fingers) says a lot about you sir and your ppints. Go drink coffee, chainsmoke and speak French if you really can't stand it. After a short time see if you think France is better off than us currently. Allegiance is to the crown, not the person under it. I don't really care one way or the other but I wouldn't take your word. Sir!
Traitors
The headline is faux because the King is not exposed just belittled by a Moron.
Not to mention that england is STILL a colonial owner of other lands.. they own the land, all cars.. they reward the worst of the worst for carrying out an agenda regardless of the devastation caused. They are disgusting parasites, and we cant stand their institution. From NZ
This man tells it like it is. He speaks the truth! If you said in public what he does, you'd get bashed within an inch of your life! Most British people idolise the royals.
The thing is, a lot of brits n english are happy being peasants. They are so delusional that they are happy seeing these people living rich n filthy whilst they beg for scraps that they have ownership too but have willingly given up that ownership
Respectfull sir ...why did u swear an allleagance to these people now ......but if it all went down you would be callled to fight against you own people ......my dad was 2 para.....and this shit that is going down is .....reall out of order sir
The king deserves privacy. From his staff especially. We all have a right to privacy.
Do we really have a king? NO, so many people hate him and want him gone as much as we want STARMERS head on the palace gates now that would be worth watching
When they are caught by the cojones their  need for security and future welfare resides in their agreement with the catcher.
GOD SAVE THE KING,EH!!!😊😊😊
real truth was nowhere in this speil....(((saxa gotha coberg))) jewish muppets, say no more
Mock the politicians who make us choose between fuel and food. That’s the problem now!
How did they get all of those jewls
Charles knew Ep "apparently" before anyone else! _HE_ intro Andrew to Ep! But Andrew _had_ 2 take fall, _keep 👁s off Charles_
Rich get richer and the poor get poorer it’s sad world we live in
💯 agree
Well fair play to you you know Keith Richards would totally agree with you but his bank mate mick jagger got knighted and Richards was disgusted and rightly so , you have described them brilliantly well done done
Always about the arms trade
The king doesn't care about us. He doesn't care about anything except dodging tax and maintaining his inherited wealth. They are parasites.
Very good  narrative 👍👍👍  I agree with you all the way

King Humpty Dumpty!Should hand off while the opportunity  remains
Thank  You word ring true today more than ever. It is way past time for people to learn how to roll themselves and stop being Slav to the multinationals corporations.
The royal family are no longer relevant.
This guy is a moron .. he wants to kill the king to crown the new king. You think France is free now ??? You clown. Its the companies, the banking systems, you think it matters who you vote for? You think that they care about you?
the idea that any simpleton civilian worships their slave master on his gold throne is hilarious!
❤
Windsor are Germans... Get these Windsor to pay for their crimes throughout human history.
Agree with you soldier.  Was looooong due.. to get red of this nonsense royal family. This Dude Charles never had a fkng job in his life. Expecting British people to pay for his nonsense circus. Dressing up. And wave at morans that supported this family for so damn long.  Greetings from USA
Thanks Joe 👍
Opa!
King wingnut is not to be exposed for his penchant for global genocide of lessor humans, nor should he be judged for having familial attatchments to accused pedophiles or deceased pedophiles who were 'close' friends..nor should he be judged for his membership of the infamous WEF a globalist cabal of venture capitalists, we being thier cattle....nothing to worry about here....
Today i was thinking to myself,  i wonder how these criminals came about? And randomly later today i came across this video without even searching.  Thanks.
Absolutely 💯
That's what I have been saying but it's above their head.
Disgusting.
You might expose king charles but prince andrew exposes himself! Get it? I'll leave now
The royal family are supposed to be role models. Princess Diana was like a lamb to the slaughter, just to give him heirs.  Being involved with WEF is absolutely unforgivable.
King charles doesn't care about the patriots.
Live of the people leeches. Like the corrupt democrats.
Love you brother  God be with you
Their not human Diana said
Well don't know  if it happened  in that  country.?
They are islamist  look it up Charlie's  mum used to over there  sipping  tea and hunting  black people  all the  time
YOUR INCARCERATION IS YOUR INABILITY TO SEE GOD IN YOUR HEART 963
Lol! Don't What about the private banking system as well?
Eternal world history
Queen Elizabeth was the last popular monarch. Now the 'magic' has gone. Nothing left of substance.
We in India are not fans of  the British royals for obvious reasons although we have been guilty of adoring various unworthy leaders ourselves.
The British royal family is worth 30-60 billion dollars why do the taxpayers pay for their lifestyle or security. You work hard to give your money to a bunch of inbred billionaires is crazy it’s 2025 not the 1600’s
It’s hard to believe that UK is still rooting for monarchy in 21st century.
All I know is that I'd hate to be a British Royal Family member on judgement day... It is strange that some people actually believe the late Queen was a Christian... They just pose as Christians to continue the support for them... EDIT: I have to disagree about them being gangsters because gangsters are only doing what they do to elevate their family & community out of poverty.
From experience there are quite a few soldiers who think in these ways.  I say those soldiers are typical sycophants - loving and despising at the same time.
A wee girl  told  princess anne to her face she was ugly  and held up her princess  barbie and said  this what a princess looks like  the  wee girls  parents were made to apologise  , it was on the  national  news  , i can't  recall  how  long ago it  was  but  i remember it clearly  , the  little  girl was probably told by her mother that  she was going to  see  a real  princess  and the  wee girl probably  thought that   she was going to see something  similar to her princess  barbie  doll and was disappointed  at the  sight  of princess anne and just spoke  the truth,  its  like  going to see  a dalek and all you  get is a dust bin turned  upside down  , how utterly  disappointing
I 100% agree with you. They’ve never worked today in their lives.
I'm actually repulsed by Englands monarch situation they're living off the people on public dole unlike the public assistance of survival needs
England is a stupid bore.
The monarchy has a history of wealth and power which is downplayed
Eighth of the day, we are just ATM machines for them
Charles is a traitor to the people of the UK.  Look at the immigration problem. He has not said a word about the destruction of the UK , the corruption in Westminster, the poor struggling ....The royals are maggots and leeches ...🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
What about if King Charles dissolves parliament?

I do agree. They don't bring any money to the UK. They just take money and doing nothing.
Won't subscribe. Just a load of BS...
King Ha ha reminds me of Kenny Everett with his medals extending a foot beyond his shoulders. What a duffer KC is.
Charles the Weak is definitely not my King..The British monarchy died with thr death of  our Queen Elizabeth the 2nd..
First you gave to access the billions the Queen had and now Charles the turd has in overseas bank accounts for the British population.
He has proven to ba a very dangerous crackpot  and still noone can see his damage to Britain.
How ridiculous does he look?
What the fuck is going on why do people not see what going on a meet him in 1979 and he pick me out off hundreds of school kids they knew wat a was but i was never knew nuthing av been put to sleep aw ma life but a fucked everyrhing sorry
Saddam Hussein used to wear a uniform despite never having been a soldier too. Jimmy Saville gave marriage advice to Charles & Diana, I wonder who's decision that was. And I'd imagine the advice was, "You make sure to keep your head down lady. Bad things can happen if you don't. You could be driving along to any of your functions or fun days and boom........ car crash.......no more marriage problems."   The true ghoulish nature of Charles, his family and his friends was never expected to be revealed.
Looking at him there with the Paras, nothing more than stolen valour.
Agree with everything you say.
They are so useless they have achieved nothing. You are so right
The American constitution was influenced by John Locke who tried to persuade the leading enlightened thinkers that human reason was compatable with the bible . He mixed the ideals with religion( Stolen ) . Go back to the first empire and god was invented to give the monarch legitamacy.  Kings were seen as a manifestation of god in the flesh . It was the Persian Ezra who gave the Jews their laws at the second temple , the jewish god is the Persian god Jupiter known in Babylon as Maruduk.  The caste systems that were perpetuated in the east were mirrored by the Greeks who were copied by the Romans . Emporer Constantine saw himself as the image of Apollo known in Egypt as Horus whom all pharohs were the image . Constantines title pontifex maximus passed to the Roman Pontifs , the age of reason and science ignored by the deluded plebs living in ignorance . Even biblical revelations points to the fact that they made Apollo the christ ,
Fully agree with everything said on this Podcast
Meddlels everywhere but they stand on the side never a shot fired !!  Pretend  soldiers  ! Looks good but it's fake !!!
This guy has exposed nothing except the massive chip on his shoulder.
Oh yea yea because all that money would come to us would it ? There’s no inequality  in France ? Or other countries that have no monarchy . I’m not saying ours is a perfect system but really you sound like the worst kind of unthinking Marxist types
4:16 sex pistols? ugh they are establishment. They pretend to hate the monarchy. they are complete frauds.A jumped up pop group.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXRjqFYfLVA - this is a King
Charles was my Battalion Commander in Chief, I had no problem with the Royals until I found out that most of the land they claim to own, they actually don't. The public is being conned and the money made from this land they pocket.
Gangsters yes
Well said🎉
Carlo brutto essere guerrafondaio traditore della moglie e del popolo via carlo viva wuilliam
Carlo caput ignorante crominale
you have a king why do we need a foreigner to be our king in Australia . Yet we can’t convince our government to become a republic.
❤
Why do you push the army thing so hard. You were in the RLC, you left your muckas, jacked on the lads. Charlatan
ALL govts are psychopathic genocidal inhuman  maniac. and the people follow them no matter what.
Charlie came to Australia when I was just a boy..The thought that that came to mind as I watched the parade that passed by as I stood in the street .." Who the hell is this d.........head...😂😂😂😂😂😂😂.
What a load of rubbish
Who financed Oliver Cromwell? Who financed Hitler? History  makes it appear overnight  men of modest means and authority  suddenly morphed into power  without benefit  of a powerful  backer, quite impossible.
Informative  history is denied  us if it conficts with the narrative they eschew , modern  day historians find themselves  traveling  to Russia  to find unburned historical  documents,  which are of course  denied  as forgeries by the  west  who thought  they destroyed  them all
it was said the king never was in any of the forces,, he went to university instead and gained a degree , what's all the paraphyllia on his uniform
At least Harry fought in Afghanistan, he gets all the vitriol.  But we do need to be rid of the dysfunctional Charles and his family.
Wow wouldn't trust this guy as a British Soldier. Hopefully this moran was kicked out of the army.
I was watching this got recommended lots of Mafia videos
Really? mate? most know what they are perhaps you should look at the Westminster? and the higher elite , lol get with the  way we live here
i think royalties   time  has come.....it is an outdated    institution.
And the king charges the NHS for them to park ambulances on one of his property.
You speak the truth
The Windsor Mafia!
another woman bumped off by this disgusting family.all to protect his nonce brother.
The world is a charaide of costumes, the royals, the papacy, etc. It's all fraud, smoke & mirrors. The cause of the worlds problems. Time to wake up, or we become their tools.
Charles  is a douche in love with himself,  greedy and self absorbed
Hold up Oliver Cromwell as your vision for your ideal then acknowledge he became a tyrant and quickly move on with your narrative! 😂
How can people believe in the monarchy anymore?  They are ultra rich, out of touch, and both Charles and William will not be defenders of the Christain Faith.  I am sick of rich people dictating how the rest of people should live....poverty is once again on the rise, and children are suffering too. They are no longer relevant, and not one of them has challenged Starmer and his dictatorship or raised issues of child poverty or overcrowding due to mass illegal immigration.
Oh shut up.  He did not ask to be king he was born into it. Was that his fault?  No doubt you would go and work in Tesco if you were  born into role of King through no fault of your own.  In fact why dont you go and get your own grubby hands dirty and stop being so judgemental.
How do you feel about Nigel Farage as elected head of state?
They cost 500 million sterling per year, tenfold that of other European "Royals." They were originally transplanted from Europe. My question is: do they bring in 5oo million in pounds sterling or more, or less???
Not my king absolutely hate this Muslim traitor
King Charles is a fraud, doesn’t care about our people either, he’s eletist!
100% on the money needs to be said, end this Tax payer funded circus🤬
Fighting for them is fighting to keep your self Stupid and Poor
People need to wake up to what is in front of your eyes it is all pageantry in the physical . But spiritually we are heading to the biggest exposure in history and heading to the great final conflict. Read the book of revelation in the bible it’s all in there studied it 30 years ago it’s all happening today.
He is a traitor and the antichrist
Thank you DDN but what chance have we got to change things NOT A LOT AS THINGS STAND, the flag wavers will be out in force, (as the saying goes) he who feeds the crocodile gets eaten last BUT STILL GETS EATEN.
It's more of pantomime with the RF in those uniforms and medals .They haven't earned the them.
So good to hear someone say it like it really is. Ditch the Monarchy.
Thanks
Monarchy full of pedos and weirdo's
A king do we need him no a queen that as no compassion we don't need just look at the money we'd have if we stop paying to a lord of his land both do sod all for the masses and i look back all the royal family never done much the church of England needs sorting out and Keir starmer like remove him from office not to hard your common sense hero

The politics of envy is alive and well in the UK. In fact, that's probably all there is to the UK. Why do you insist on acting like peasants? Why do you think anyone should pay taxes? Why should I pay for other people to do things I don't agree with? I don't want an army, all you do is kill other people and steal other people's resources so that rich men can sell more arms. You're part of the problem. You now just want to steal and make yourself king. You don't want equality for all, you just want what they have.
People are celebrating tyranny. Why are we paying for these people? Because the people in government back people like this because the people in government are controlled by people like this puppets for the elite?
A year later, it’s even worse. The fascist regime
I THINK CHARLIE BOY HAS DONE FOR THE ROYALS, I FEEL THINGS WILL NEVER BE THE SAME NOW WITH THE MUSLIM RELIGION PUT FIRST WHAT ABOUT THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND ?
KC loves to  ostentatious himself.
Get a life. You are full of hatred, your word means nothing and your book not worth the print.
NOT MY KING
Our true king lives in Australia but will not come back and take his rightful place
Someone who obviously has a mind full of concrete and little else.
They are pathetic fraudsters and scammers. End the monarchy.
Cross pollenated - brilliant!
No Matter what  Country   we talk about  its always 💯     ( HAVES  & HAVE NOTS!!)
Not my king wot a let down it is
My question is why have a King then and keep paying him ? I don't think visitors would come for the weather !
You said it😂
The Royals are deep down German decent ,who like other royals answer to the Illuminate
God came to earth to save us from our sins, the next time he returns, he returns with a sword, hes coming to fight and by his side we will fight. Our king lives in australia, not the uk
But they’ve never served.  They are fake.
The Royal Family have fallen.  Film title.
How do cousin marriage
"Absolutely right" the Monarchy offers nothing, no support from King Charles, traitor to Britain,  simply a drain on the British taxpayers' money.

Did you work for a security company in Basra Iraq ?
The biggest question is what does the royal work truly consists of? Clearly, 'the royal work' whatever that is, it is not same as the work under the terms and conditions the reasonable person is working. it is time to stop funding the security for the 'working royals' because they are none working whatsoever, they are super rich and privileged and shouldn't expect funding by the poor. Meanwhile, Prince Harry bravely fights to pay for his security and I admire him for being financially independent. 👏
So all those Soul diers who are off to fight in Ukraine and leave the British woman and children unprotected like the fuffin police are doing ..here is what your fighting for ...they about to show you they never went away...Ottoman Ukraine (Ukrainian: Османська Україна), Khan Ukraine (Ukrainian: Ханська Україна), Hanshchyna (Ukrainian: Ганьщина) was a region of right-bank Ukraine (including southern regions of the Kiev Voivodeship), which came under Ottoman suzerainty in the aftermath of Petro Doroshenko's union with the sultan......and they brag about it https://youtube.com/shorts/M2X-BvWurUU?si=TyX7Q_Lvy8pic3Fp
So far it seems like more of an anti-monarchy argument than anti-charles.
1. To avoid the automatic succession of Charles I's son Charles, an Act was passed on 30 January forbidding the proclaiming of another monarch. On 7 February 1649, the office of King was formally abolished. 2. Malcolm Livingstone – who appeared on photos around the world as he helped carry Diana's coffin – suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder following a tour of Iraq.He also served abroad in Kuwait, Cyprus and the Balkans and was a footman to the Queen. One of his last duties before leaving the RAF in 2004 was serving in Iraq in 2003, the year the country was invaded. Mr Livingstone was issued with a sleeping bag and blanket but at the age of 44 yrs was found dead in a church next to the shelter two days after his second visit, told him they had no bed/room for him.Temperatures were below 1C on the night Mr Livingstone died. Far cry from the treatment given to the illegal army of young men ALLOWED to invade the UK, who receive a warm hotel room/bed, clothes etc etc not to mention full board. 3.Charlie Chaplin said in his speech 1940 "Don't let evil men USE YOU AS CANNON FODDER.    A toxicology report found no drugs or alcohol in his system.
Ditch the monarchy.
I first became aware of all the hoo ha surrounding that family when I was very young . I was dragged to see the train the queen was on after the coronation as it sped by and I saw nothing.My gran took me to the cinema and had to stand for the anthem at the end of a film. I was 7 and refused. My young brain knew it was all wrong same as giving my ha' penny to the black babies when the pope lived in splendour. All wrong. I am no monarchist. I am spiritual but no longer belong to a religion.
Only clowns follow so called Royals
Exactly theve been doin it since the dawn of time going around the world,  and claiming that that country is theirs and all who go there. Even their mens wives and children were all fair game. I never liked charles for making the princes walk behind their mother on the day they should have been cuddled n comforted for their loss of our Diana and now look what theyve done to those boys its saad as forthe rest of them i have no time for any of the royal family its the kids i fel sorry for their never going to have a childhood their grown up before their time its not fair. Plus i agree with evrything you said . These people for at the end of the day are just people that we dont owe anything to they think yheir entitled the rich just keep getting richer and the poor are getting poorer by the second . They are the ones that are free to do what they want any  old time plus they dont deserve the titles their given especially Camilla ohgawd give me strength i have no doubt that this Company will continue to bleed us dry for thats what they are a business making machine f them a wee Scottish granny xx🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿✋🫂🫂💜💜🙏🙏👅😘😜🌹🌹🌹🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
You are so right in your criticisms.
The royals (small r) are a disgrace to whatever one looked up to 😮
I am an American and I agree with your many astute spot on points. I pray that the True King of kings come and fills the nations with his Kingdom! Come Jesus.😊
Hes phoney his mother also was involved in world economic forumn and they used diana to give heirs to throne and had her killed .p Roberts
He cosied up with the puppet Zelensky. He'll be cheering when OUR military gets sent over there.. All going to the Globalists plans. 🤢
Go away!!
Non of these current ones are not Royal line at all has gone on many times in past.
🎉
After what he ‘hasn’t’ done over the past year I am done with the monarchy.  Thought the Queen was cute as an old woman and wills and Kate were cool but no more. Never liked Charles, my mum warned me years ago he would be a bad king.
As an African, I’m glad people are speaking out.   The current generations though are gonna be living the realities of Africa. I guess this is the blessing of struggle- that nothing is new to us. We’ve struggled at the hands of a random foreign elite ‘family’. Smh
He ain’t no king. Nor was Liz a queen
Isn't  the billions spent on illegals of first importance.  That seems to be much more than the Monarchy has. However, all who receive from the public purse should be audited and made accountable.  That definitely includes politicians and the public servants.

i couldn't have put it better my self
They used to tell the poor,  along with the church and it's creepy crawlies, that the King was chosen by God.
4:53 Oh simple, the far-right. They are still the ultimate rebels.
KC is no King, his mother knew that that’s why she held on so long!  He is a traitor to the monarchy king of Ishlam.
Now charles is islam and saying islamic prayers, what a joke.
The royals are corrupt
I’m sure the wealthy good men have imported some good freedom spreaders and freedom seeds! Hahaha SAS can help
SAS for UKs Freedom!!!!!!
IT'S VERY SAD,THERE IS TRUE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT: *UK-KING IS AN ISLAM-CONVERT !!!!: *IS IT TRUTH,PLEASE,TO RESEARCH ABOUT IT!!!
How Oliver Crowell was an agent of Amsterdam Jews.  "1643 brought a large contingent of Jews to England, their rallying point was the house of the Portuguese Ambassador De Souza, a Marano (secret Jew). Prominent among them was Fernandez Carvajal, a great financier and army contractor."  In January of the previous year, the attempted arrest of the five members had set in violent motion the armed gangs of "Operatives" already mentioned, from the city. Revolutionary pamphlets were broadcasted on this occasion, as Disraeli tells us: "Bearing the ominous insurrectionary cry of 'To your tents, O Israel'." Shortly after this the King and the Royal Family left the Palace of Whitehall. The five members with armed mobs and banners accompanying them, were given a triumphal return to Westminster. The stage was now set for the advent of Carvajal and his Jews and the rise of their creature Cromwell.  The scene now changes. The Civil War has taken its course. The year is 1647: Naseby has been won and lost. The King is virtually a prisoner, while treated as an honoured guest at Holmby House.  According to a letter published in Plain English on 3rd September, 1921:  "The Learned Elders have been in existence for a much longer period than they have perhaps suspected. My friend, Mr. L. D. van Valckert, of Amsterdam, has recently sent me a letter containing two extracts from the Synagogue at Mulheim. The volume in which they are contained was lost at some period during the Napoleonic Wars, and has recently come into Mr. van Valckert' s possession. It is written in German, and contains extracts of letters sent and received by the authorities of the Mulheim Synagogue. The first entry he sends me is of a letter received:  16th June, 1647. From O.C. (i.e. Oliver Cromwell), by Ebenezer Pratt. "In return for financial support will advocate admission of Jews to England: This however impossible while Charles living.  "Charles cannot be executed without trial, adequate grounds for which do not at present exist. Therefore advise that Charles be assassinated, but will have nothing to do with arrangements for procuring an assassin, though willing to help in his escape.  In reply was dispatched the following:  12th July, 1647. To O.C. by E. Pratt. "Will grant financial aid as soon as Charles removed and Jews admitted. Assassination too dangerous. Charles shall be given opportunity to escape: His recapture will make trial and execution possible. The support will be liberal, but useless to discuss terms until trial commences."  With this information now at our disposal, the subsequent moves on the part of the regicides stand out with a new clearness. On 4th June, 1647, Cornet Joyce, acting on secret orders from Cromwell himself, and, according to Disraeli, unknown even to General-in-Chief Fairfax, descended upon Holmby House with 500 picked revolutionary troopers and seized the King. According to Disraeli,  "The plan was arranged on May 30th at a secret meeting held at Cromwell's house, though later Cromwell pretending that it was without his concurrence."  This move coincided with a sudden development in the army; the rise of the "Levelers" and "Rationalists". Their doctrines were those of the French revolutionaries; in fact, what we know today as Communism. These were the regicides, who four times "purged" Parliament, till there was left finally 50 members, Communist-like themselves, known later as the Rump.
Thank you for the truth !
I DO Exactly AGREE 👍. with YOU Sir 🙂.  I'm from Zamboanga City ⛵ 🏝️ Philippines 🇵🇭
Thank you for your commentary.
The reason why we never shut up about the American revolution is to remind ourselves that there people today who would reverse it and set themselves up as sole perpetual ruler with a ruling clique. Most people think of the American revolution as a isolated incident. It is not. It has it's roots in the English civil war. Sir Henry Vane Governor of the Massachusetts colony during the English civil war. He wrote a letter to the colony basically saying that the war was not in our interest since it really did not affect the colony and other colonies. His beliefs in a Republican form of government caught on in the colonies leading to the revolution and the founding of the United States. Sir Henry Vane is the founder of the United States. Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Adams, etc. just carried it through.
I always knew this. 😂I mean just look at them. Kings and queens of what, I say.
Abolish the monarchy start concentrating and important duties. They havent even proper line of succession any more Megan will not prove the kids are from her body. Its ruined now.
Here here ....corrupt from top to bottom
the kings i read about that i would accept as leaders are the first to charge into battle on their horse leading their people. that kind of leadership should be earned not inherited.
archaic.
Without the king 👑 and the monarchy England will be just another country. It is the duty of every English men to stand by the king 👑 and defend him
If the Royals would eliminate some pomp ceremonies and announce we are withdrawing from certain things in order to provide for the homeless or overtaxed, I'll bet their respect would return!
Well that was England’s main revolution, not nesesarily Scotlands I think.
Why dont you just admit you're a communist? Mean while hiding behind the uniform of the British Army. You're a grifter whose word means nothing.
Thethoughtof starmer being head of state, keeps me on the fence.
Absolutely spot on good job I've been dealing with these reptilians for a long time n it's way worse than could be imagined namaste
Isn't the Royal Family, really German,??? not British?
Thank you brother
King Charles is evil
Jesus is the way John 14 6 KJV
Im an Australian
As a people we just don't know our own history. Charles is a 'Windsor'. George V changed the family name during the first world war. His family name was the house of Sax Coburg & Gotha (German). When did he change the name to Windsor? Not 1914, not 1915, not 1916, not until July 1917. Why did this Geman family wait until then? Because the Americans officially entered the war in April 1917 and it was clear that Germany would lose. All throughout that war the royal family held on to their proud German heritage despite watching 700,000 British soldiers losing their lives by July '17. Why would George V be so slow to make this choice? Because Kaiser Wilhelm, the German leader, was his 1st cousin, they were both grandsons of Victoria. When it comes to the monarchy their loyalty is to their family NOT the people.
Nazi pedo german royals not British fact look at family tree the movie the sound of music is based on them idiots fact
Inbred tax dodgers
Replacing the monarchy with a republic only makes your country worse
Loved the comment about Charles being downgraded to live in a council house.  Right now he would be competing with migrants for one. However, some kind Imam might let him live in a mosque rent free! He wouldn't be welcome in mine though.
More and more people are going against monarchy,  the country is falling to pieces and they are still taking millions
The "French model" IS COMING, and sooner than we think (#Tribulation). The Vatican and the British monarchy are the wealthiest entities on earth, one for religion, one for banking, and the 3rd leg is New York for business. These are the true powers that be.
A republican regime won't be better. Look at France, do you like what it has become? Change your dynasty, don't replace monarchy with republic. I'm from Romania and we live in a republic since 1948 and the situation is no better than in UK.
Thank you soldier well said
The latest tyrant in an almost inexhaustible line of robber barons.
How refreshing to hear a very articulate former British soldier and true patriot speaking truth to power...
CHARLES IS WEAK MINDED , A SIMOLETON , THEY SPEND MONEY ON EXPENSIVE EDUCATION BY THEY ARE JUST TRULY IGNORANT,  HE DISGUSTS ME AND HOW HE SHOW HIS FACE IN PUBLIC SHAKING ELDERS HANDS, AND SMALL CHILDREN KNOWING HES CORRUPT AND BELIEVES IN DEPOPULATION AND ROBBI G HUMAN FREEDOMS , THERE IS SO MANY LIES THIS FAMIKY IS BUILD ON AND IT JUST GOT MORE EVOLVED WHEN THEU RECUITED MEGHAN MARKLE AND THE SPARE FOR POLITICAL TAMPERING IN THE UNITED STATES , HOW DO THEY ENTER A CHURCH AND NOT IMPLODE
Even if you believe in monarchy you need to see what frauds the Saxe Coburgs / Windsors are. They were chosen by politicians - only 42nd in line because the MPs and Lords found them acceptable. Hence they're Hello magazine insecure look at me stuff for the last 100 years as democracy spread around Europe. The legitimate European Royal families dont behave in this vulgar nouveau way because they know their lineage and roots
Military cosplay....across the pond we yanks call that Stolen Valor.  We punish that.
57 % German
Empire is DEAD! Leaches are still milking UK citizens!
A complete and utter waste of space, I despise ANY so called elites as they are only there by the sweat and labour of the common man.
Satans Minions Pirates parasites have always believed this I am from the UK buy live in Aust it's amazing how many people revere them same ppl that got the jab - so basically they are adored by morons
What sort of treatment did Oliver Cromwell give humble folks in Ireland?  Was Cromwell and his army  at best vermin?  This "leveler" seems to have no respect for private property.  No doubt, he loves what Starmer has done to the UK. Is it this kind of thinking that is finding Shakespeare a racist, or leading to the economic collaspe of the UK?😊
What load crap
I agree tbf.
WHAT revolution did the French have, they let the Germans right into French with a few French men standing up for their Country, that got them nowhere, the German military went straight over them and took over France with ease....
This king will cause a massive revolution.the people had enough
That's to bad. I like William and Kate .can't stand charlie or camel..jmo
Back in the  remember a conversation between my parents and some of their friends.  They all said the same god help the uk once the queen dies how right they were even back then. I've always detested him and andrew now that creature he calls a son is there as well. I think there are enough people who are opening their eyes to old chuck and are hoping the royal family are abolished.  They are very devious. Just think of all the things that have been hidden for them. Now we see just a tip of the iceberg chuck buried for his hideous son. Not my king.
No such things as kings and queens. Real life is not game of thrones. There are no dragons or dinosaurs either. This is real life.
Not my king... Scotland doesn't need this freak show,  nor do our friends in England
This needs an updated video on his current treason.  He’s fostering in Islam to the Christian English Irish and Scottish
Mark Felton did an excellent video on all the SCAMS ( no other word is apt) the RF has to generate income.  From the inheritance grab to the ambulance parking fees, there are many. Shut down the Sovereign Grant for 1 thing.  That can be done in a single Act of Parliament.

The King as turned traitor to the nation getting into bed with the enemy of the UK and Europe
He says to the Brits, you can kiss my royal azz
Charles has always been a doofis, his mother didnt want him to become king cuz she knew it too!
What institution isn't today? - crooked as a rams horn-  They are coming out of the woodwork.🤣what is new in the   :Monitary  world?
What about the Queen? She had grace.
Exactly - all monarchs are just the gangsters who succeeded to gain total power and institutionalised their power. People have helium brains if they can’t see the exact scheme with unsuccessful gangsters and murderers.
what was that thing that charles wanted to be again oh yes a vampires tea bag.the way things are now with the royals we might as well vote Katie price in as queen , at least she gives us some entertainment with her face lifts , we would have to keep changing her image on the coins and band note though.
It's worse than you think. Charles is The Antichrist. Look into author Tim Cohen if interested. He is on YouTube, and his book "The Antichrist and a Cup of Tea" is enlightening.
This King Has Failed Britain And Citizens Badly. Royalty Died When The Queen Died
Inbred morons sums it up right there.  I've never understood why the people put up with the royal family living off of them like leeches.  Every time I hear how hard the royal family works it cracks me up.  They don't know what work is, much less hard work!
Tyrannical government commonwealth countries installed WEF globalist criminal syndicate. Pedos. 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
All commonwealth countries are being destroyed by King Charles Mark Carney Trudeau Klaus Schwab WEF globalist criminal syndicate. 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
I really feel for the British people because charles will promote gis ONE WORLD ORDER and will become enemy number one.
They are all connected,, royal families,, the Vatican,, Jerusalem the jews,,,then the presidents around the world,,new world order,,they all eat and sleep together. We all are waking up from how corruption started within high positions.🧐
Hang on to your hats, were headed soon for the one world order
Remembering the Borgians and their "You will be assimilated". culture of destruction and assimilation. Authoritarian gangsters at the top of political power.
👍
Our people died for this land, its ours by right...
he is a senior wef member and im afraid so is william . please say im wrong about william. too many pics of him at the wef
i do not believe that the queen died on her own accord.
Thank you for being awake
The real non gov corporate Artists who detest all this are observing and in hiding. Highly aware of what is going on. Do not think they are not at work behind the scenes
I pray the moral police of Britain don't raid your home at 5.00am and place you in the prison cell next to Tommy Robinson. What is happening in Britain today would never happen under a Margaret Thatcher government. She was a 100% supporter of a free society, which no longer exists in Britain today.
I must admit, I don't understand how Brits advocate supporting one family. They get cooks, nannies, soldiers on horses, and the best money can buy. Look at the way their children are dressed, and look at your children clothing. The babies embroidered   gowns cost more than a grown womans entire outfit! Do your own children go to Eton, to learn? Yet you pay for their children's education! Why are they not using your taxes, to give all Brit children, a good place to learn? Instead, they advocate to have the world's worst, (and I do mean, WORST) people  come and live on your block, or awful council estates (talk about lip stick on a pig analogy!), so they can begin indoctrination by age 5. Why are they not inviting those children, who look about age 25-30 to live near or with their own children?
❤fightin for Britain now is a mugs game pathetic fighting for a country like our grandfather's who where on the frontline ,and fought for our politicians to flood our Britain with illegal immergrants why fight for these rapists murderers fraudsters who do not belong here think long and  hard son think  befor you join up son ,but I tell you these lot aren't worth the ground they walk on a complete  waste of space .resign now gov.
Insolent Stalinist.
In the USA we are struggling today because a majority of voters cast their vote for a criminal fascist buffoon who wants to be an autocrat. I like Brits in general and have worked with many of them. But I will never understand why they continue to tolerate a monarchy at such a great expense. They say the class system is dead in the UK, but that's simply not true. Even today someone's future is nearly always determined in the UK by their accent. If Britain wants to continue with monarchy, at a minimum they should limit the so-called royals to a single publicly owned palace, confiscate private properties such as Balmoral and Sandringham which were bought with money stolen from the people, and stop paying for lavish coronations and other unnecessary expenses. I am grateful that I was not born in such a country. The monarch should pay the same amount of taxes as anyone else. And their tax return should be made public. Make them pay death taxes too. But better yet, and the monarchy and replace it with a real democracy.
The French are even worse off than the Brits, they are banch of woke......so corrupt to the core all bought up to the Sionistte maconic tribes
Very informative!
England need a new Oliver Cromwell !
You look this king and you turn yourself republican!
Charles has always been a weakling & the monarchy should be scrapped! They remain rich while the British people are broke!
As an American, there are far greater thieves in Britain than the Monarchy. How are the Richest families in Britain not even British???? Why do you all love Diana so much? She was dating a Muslim!
Lol military cosplay is right
The HATED KING,!  AND HE KNOWS IT!
Well said, thank you, this is a conversation as a nation we need to have
It's a shame to see this from USA. I thought Royalty demanded respect, not perverted idealogy and illegal immigration.  Replacing everyone at the expence of taxpayers.  Something must change and very soon.
giving a Knighthood to Sadique Khan is just horrible
The super rich ppl have volonized their own country(s) bleeding all money out of reach for regular ppl into globalist pockets
Book to read,   The queen and I .    Sue Townsend must read .  Brilliant and very funny
Ya'll need to grow up.   That trust fund baby you call kings is far away from it.  What heroic and brave things he have ever done?
Why do you guys even have a Royal family?I don't understand
Time to go Charlie boy!!!
The tourists will still come for the palaces and the wonderful soldiers marching in sync….and the organisation of spectacle …which is not done by the RF…
Britain doesn't have true Royals, they have overlords and warchiefs.
for me I've read and listen to a good few testimonies about the royals behind closed doors and how they speak to there butlers and maids that work for them , really disgusts me , constantly telling off and belittling there  staff.
Muslim loving wef
They used a whole generation of our best young men as canon fodder for a decoy manouvre at Gallipoli...they start the wars and run both sides - hence royal support of hitler ffs! The worst organised criminals on the planet! and biggest existential threat!
I always thought the british people would be happy one day that they still have their royal family, even if their parliament is dominated by Muslims. A king should be focal point and the bearer of his people's cultur. As a German, I would rather have an emperor who is a welcoming-clown, than a left-wing Bundestag president who repeatedly lets it be known in his speeches how much he hates the German people. But apparently I was wrong. Prince Charles is said to have already converted to Islam. Freemason country, Baphomet a misspelling of the name maphomet the medievil form of mohammed. It's their god, so it's logical and sad.
he should move to the USA
Illuminati
It is very difficult to formulate an argument against a well educated man.
Couldn't agree with you MORE
Who WHO wants King Charles ? No like ability, no chemistry with the subjects, why WHY?
"What is history but a fable agreed upon"
I am completely alligned with your view. Thankfully the truth is finally coming to light
Charles is part of the Illuminati
Charles is an Muslim
Well done
Excellent insight into the monarchy. Sadly the freedom of speech in Britain is becoming a crime. The US was headed in that direction. I've always thought the monarchs were parasites!
Where does Charlie buy his medals or have they been bequeath by Michael Jackson?
What does Charles actualy do workwise that is?
King is a queen 😂
He's a fine wine guzzling traitor
UK like many geographic expressions are corporations created by elites to control (govern the peasants).
leaders propose, God DISPOSES =  At the end of the 'day', it is God's declaration and Divine imposition, that causes proper situations to become manifested before our eyes and Nerve endings. Leaders and kings are just puppets in God's wielding Hands. God also has masters to answer to, and God must have a proper response or face the wrath of His Masters = His Devotees. So, let not your hearts be troubled. God is in full control. Vengeance is Mine, saith God. Jesus said = judge NOT, lest ye be judged ( in like manner).
Are you a communist? Bitter and twisted.
Do not despair. I think the outlaw and the hillbilly may be able to loosen the hold.
Shame on you people that make these videos! Your country needs you to strengthen it and not be cowards and side with communists and filthy people that will give you money to make these disgraceful videos so they could weaken your country. You are the same people that years ago laughed at churches and Jesus. You were successful and now churches are empty and abandoned. So now the Royal family is on your dirty agenda. Let me see what tyrants you want to get power! Funny how the first way to overthrow people you tell people they don’t have food to put on the table. Shame on you.
He has been cursed with cancer
Socialist covertusness
Why do we want or need a monarchy,it is not democratic,JESUS is free love him or leave him he will not force himself upon you,.HE is KING you do not need two kings examine your self and choose
British Mafia but more powerful!
charles has become stupid and lacks empathy. doesnt he care how insafe muslim men haVE MADE WOMENS 'LIVES. SQUASH CHARLES. HES UNFIT TO RULE.
At the moment they are important as they serve as not just a attraction for tourists but more so politicians as Trump adores the Royals and they give us more connections to important allies. HOWEVER, our failing power and the US withdrawing from Europe will make them useless and then i would say they just act as a drain on the nation and will stand as centuries of inequality. Charles is one of the richest men in the world and he hasnt worked etc. His large connection of other lords and rich men due to centuries of family connections which yes has led to inbreeding means they hold huge amounts of the Nations wealth but pay no tax as they dont work.
Winston Churchill was a coward . He would leave London during the blitz
Agreement What a swamp of snakes and criminals inbred morons Service what a Lie  God Save the Queen she aint no human being and England is Screaming
Greece, had a monarchy that lived in opulence while the greek people lived in extreme poverty.There was a referendum in 1967 and the people voted them out.Britain should do the same.Have a referendum and put to the people.
I certainly think they are way too bloated. Too many distant cousins/relatives etc that receive money for nothing. People we've never heard of! At the very least they should scale it right back to a dozen or so and let them keep Buckingham Palace ONLY. All the rest of the properties should be sold off and the money go towards the homeless. Makes me sick when William "sleeps rough for a night" then it's back to The Palace for a good soak in his bath with gold taps and a nice sleep in his 4-poster bed. I mean, he's done this stunt a couple of times, yet nothing ever changes. All this act does is help "HIM" feel better about himself, as he has to "justify" his grotesque wealth every so often, by feeling human once in a while, but it serves no purpose to the homeless. More people than ever are homeless, and yet the Royals still give little to nothing away! Not fitting for modern times that's for sure!
Time to go
Music  to my  ears .....truth  at last  !!
Revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions revolutions now 😮

I'll have his Aston Martin 👍
Prophetic. Charles now bows to Muslims
Not my King never will be.
Whatever your views on monarchies or republics, whether you would have been a royalist or a roundhead, knowing your nation's history is essential. How much wealth, property and treasure does any one person or family really need, especially when the country supposedly can't afford to support pensioners with heating in winter?
Yep satanic
You forgot to mention they are Nazis and German.
King Charles is an idiot. I never thought much of him, however l gave him a chance to stand up, but alas he has disappointed me. The monarchy are gone if you ask me
NOT MY KING !
This bloke is pretty delusional. He's not exposing anything, just voicing his personal opinions.
Ah now we are seeing it.  WEF. 👍
Allah became Meher Baba born in IRAN, in hitler's time, and said = l am God. Evil rulers are reborn as blind beggars" --- Vengeance is Mine, saith the Lord.
and to add insult to injury, the english peasants demand to be equal to the english royalty, and impose other people, from another races, to suck up to these english peasants, on demand.
blame those damn james bond movies
What are you? A Communist?
We could send them to America, they'd love them, Netflix would pay them millioms
Wow
Rantings and ravings of an adolescent. I’ve got news for you sonny  ….. ALL societies have their privileged class and all the rest …. the case since time immemorial. A fact of life. Now … get on with it.
The cretin recently took a helicopter to visit a food bank.
Canada should no longer have ties with the royals.
Taking money from the poor.
He owns some of the land the army train on and still charges them ground rates and there the very people training to protect king and country. You would be surprised how much land he owns and charges people ground rates . He is a greedy man whilst thousands are hungry and homeless
They’re not even the true royal family, the King Arthur line is the true royal family, that’s hidden history.
Its embarrassing how pompous it is. We live in the uk and hate how rediculous how they behave. They do nothing for us. It just seems to be the elderly that like them.
Bunch of bumbling peasants... How true. I just can't believe how people who have very little admire royalty
VERY  INTERESTING 🤔. MY  RESPECTS  TO YOU     AS    A  BRITISH 🇬🇧 FORMER  SOLDIER.‼️  WHAT     IS  YOUR PERSPECTIVE OF    PRINCE  👑  WILLIAM   ❓❓❓&  PRINCE  👑  HARRY❓❓❓  THEIR   ⚜️ROYAL⚜️ LIVES   TOOK  SUCH  DIVERGENT   CHANGES....😮  DO  YOU THINK 🤔  THIS  WAS  ACCIDENTAL  OR  STAGED❓❓❓
❤❤❤❤👏👏👏👏👏🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶
Larpers! 😂😂😂😂 That's so good!
Well your royel family does have German ancestors.
The crown is just a fancy way of saying inbred dictatorship
So true. The English royals don't share their ill-gotten gains, their people sometimes get thrown a crumb too far between & maybe a medal or piece of paper of honor. The royals are the dictionary imperialists.
💯iv seen a big difference since are late queen has passed.   If someone decide to fight the king for the throne like years ago would that still not stand?? Cause world wasn’t made with a king it was money
No you have a pedifile—- in there …and Diana spoke the truth about her demise——and yes it was the current pking-Who did..-make that “happen “
They are not British —-
What about  the government  and the mp
U are a nobody
Lier,,  U can't expose a King,
Our monarchy fell when the qeen died. i served 18 years in the bootnecks and was proud to serve, but i would rather sit on an umbrella and open it up than serve this WEF antibritish king
👑 WEF Army 👑,  " We have the funds ".
Pure parasites the lot of them and the hypocrisy is mind blowing
We lasted for 6 years under Oliver Cromwell's Lord Protector rule, as a republic, & so much was achieved, as a result, BUT the Hydra  is not a mythical monster the problem being cut off one head another shall take it's place, and it did.
The Emporer's OLD clothes, isnt it? but there just arent, enough boys to literally call it out "he's naked" I'm sure that if enough of us do, we'll still keep our heads.
Military cos play, ha ha ha ha Your going to put me out of business
The Queen DID pay tax in the end (but only because she had to) BUT my biggest objection to keeping them on is an ironic one far from being a State asset they are an embarrassment to us, as there has been scandal after scandal.   Charles is now clearly too old to be king, & won't live as long as King as his mother did as Queen, he comes over as doddery bungling & confused, the royal principality in this Country is the most notorious among all Monarchy's left around the World, you never hear as much from the Swedish monarchy or the Spanish or even the Gramoldie's in Monaco, plus I would say patriotism is something that comes from the heart, we make our own choices of what we love about our country/s, we don't need to be told it,  As for business what do we have Ambassador's & trade secretary's for?
They have robbed the UK people. They own half the land being buying it all... shocking, they still continue and keep people in poverty... They corrupt Princess Diana tried to get away from them!!!
Was always ambivalent  concerning the royal family until Charles  , he's not any kind of leader , if in fact if we had a monarch  choice I believe Anne would fulfill the roll better as a figurehead for Britain , just doesn't seem so tainted somehow
The HS2 is costing £100 billion plus.  Think how much that is. A 1000 Million is a billion and we going to pay 100 times that.  This country is a laughing stock with politicians and businesses with hands in the till to rob the British tax payer.  Biggest white elephant ever to apparently save 20 mins journey time. As for migrants, legal migrants , out of 2 million that arrived, only 16 per cent work. 84 per cent on benefits and housing and every other free benefit we give them . Never mind the illegal migrants. We are the laughing stock of the World. The RNLI a free taxi service for those crossing the channel illegally then put up at our expense. They refuse to get rescued if they still in French waters.  RNLI has lost lots of donations due to them pandering to these illegals and the crews risking there lives to save them. You couldn’t make it up. Enoch Powell and the the Book 1984 couldn’t have been more accurate.  As for the RF it should be strummed right back. Get rid of Andrew , Sarah Ferguson and the other scroungers. Sussexes lose their titles . Also the money they get from the the Duchy of Cornwall should be stopped. They inherited that illegally with the way in which this land was obtained,  hundreds of years ago.
The Crown is the head of the P@3do global rings!
hilarious but treu
I'm irish and agree totally with you irish people think that we won our freedom and we are a Republic but how is it that our government still pay British monarchy money every year for the use of buildings like Dublin castle....plus I can get on a boat or plane without a passport to Britain...behind the scenes the royal family still rule everything
Well said this man !
WOW!
Love 💕 and kindness  Truly hope you survive your anarchy.
I agree
One ex soldier's opinion is just that, an opinion !

How did they get all those medals
Short live King Charles the Turd!!
He handed England over to immigrants
The who?we dont have a king,he is a silly old coward.
Totally totally agree with everything apart from people working for Railways work for a Pittance,there’s people working Much much harder for Far less.Train Drivers on about £65 /70k PA is hardly a Pittance .

Replace the  name for  robber barons.

I am not opposed to an elected Head of State, but I think I would rather have the King than a Donald Trump.

Thank you  for serving QUEEN N COUNTY   and swearing your allegiance to our Queen but you make some valid points  Lad thing is  they don't  teach any British history in school now  because  English n British  Bad  and regarding the Walter mitty  Winston Churchill  in WW2  but he did it  to rally the Troops and the Nation  👍
Exactly !!!!  Mr. Jones
IM NOT PREPARING FOR IT, IM ONLY PREPARED FOR MY DEATH,WHENEVER THAT MAY BE.
DO YOU REMEMBER TERRY WAITE   BIG LAD, I WROTE ABOUT HIM YESTERDAY  CIRCULATED IT .
He is a disgrace. He  has let the British people down. He cares more about immigrants than the British people.
We know we have always known and thats people who research these people thankyou so much ❤❤❤
🎯
Ex service 1980, find King Charles a total plomker a woky Lefty diversity champion
Dont care what you say. Ill support the Monarchy for ever❤ Oh, and I don't care about the  comments that may follow.
All you have to do is look at the past to know the truth.
Lol😂😂😂😂😂
Wet fart with no morals......his poor mother!
Spot on.  Thank you.
King Spineless wef member
William will be the same as his dad King Charles, puppets to the UN,EU,WEF and davos.We citizens in the UK sold out
Not Windsor. Coburg von Gotha.
That’s not our king portion you belong in the council house our king belong in the palace. I break your powers behind those idle words.
That’s not our king portion you belong in the council house our king belong in the palace. I break your powers behind those idle words.

This is the truth lad I am a seer I see it.. United States of Republican Briton isles Ireland ❤
Can’t stand the Royals
I'm absolutely disgusted with our so called King,  He's just stood back & done absolutely nothing to stop Starmers Tyranny when he could end this madness instantly !
They’re just a figurehead who take , take and take.  Didn’t they allude Charles needed trillions to be given to him to run the globe, klaus Schwab.
Cant stand big ears.
The English revolution is an incredible time in history full of political diversity, ideas we would think now as being contemporary. We aren't taught it in school for a reason, we are supposed to believe that it's been kings and peasants for all time, that our nature as British people is to be bumbling, foolish peasants who were happy just getting drunk, praying to god, and working to death in the fields.
The aka the firm ill give you one reason or 55trillion reasons he donated to wef while uk in cost of living crisis ❤❤THEIR KING NOT MINE
Thugs, gangsters, murderers...goes all the way back to Will the B×stard from France, eh?
Was really with him in the beginning right up until he said he wanted to be just like the french.
One by one the bad ones are being taken down Karma has a lot of work to do but it won't stop 🛑 until they are all punished 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 2:06
Amen!!  Charles ….the sooner gone the better….
Great stuff❤ Thank you.
Agree 💯they are 😈
Isn't it interesting how the Royal family are arguably the most protected institution on the planet yet so many kiddy fiddlers 'slip through the net' to befriend them?
Ana maloom arabi ana shiek Omani
King Charles is will down in history as the first Christian King in charge of a Muslim country! Charles is a treasonous fool that is allowing the rich to destroy his country. If Charles had the balls to be a King in action the people of Great Briton would support him.  Right now King Charles is more like a make-believe action figure in a box at a store than an actual King! His people and his country would support him as King if he would act like one. Since we all that will never happen, vote me in as King and I will turn the country around! King Richards lol
4:50 Society and common sense? When did this happen, ever?
3:43 It’s a prostitutional monarchy.
Your right...I feel sad about all the men and women that gave their lives for the country for nothing. Also all the civilians and animals killed during all the wars. All because of rich powerful people wanting something someone else has.
Germans
Good to listen to your channel, BUT until the FLAG WAVERS LISTEN and act accordingly we are pissing into the wind.
Come on, I love the royals. Princess Magaret, anyone?
OUTSTANDING Be safe out there Soldier
Revolution is needed. It really is the only way. Question is, what side the armed forces, police and veterans of both, choose....?
Barrack room b*ll ache.
Yep the Royals bring in money for there own pockets. They are not even real Windsors. Saxe-coburg and Gotha more like it.German.
We have this elite all over the world, a few families who want to run the world like a corporation. A few actual leaders trying to rise up. The world's oldest battle in the history:good vs evil. I wonder if these people at the top realise they're choosing the role of the villain.
Pathetic is what comes to mind
Why is Harry the only with  Ginger hair

There's only One King, the King of kings, and He will be judging kings and subjects very soon. Choose this day whom you will serve.
This king wont be a king for long because the muslims in the UK wont accept them anymore. Stay woke everyone.
👏👏👏☘️
You are not wrong. King Sausage Fingers needs to go. He’s not my king. 8:54
Head over to the John Cooper Show and find out some real info on the Royals 😮
I fight for Rome, not for Caesar. ❤️❤️🇬🇧🇬🇧
The Queen was a wonderful woman, but Charles is a woke fascist
Having lived under 'elected' heads of state, I can highly recommend constitutional monarchy. It is puerile to imagine that the vacuum caused by the removal of monarchy will not be replaced by even more, but less clearly lampoonable, characters, groups, institutions and corporations. The underlying structures aint goin' away!
BIGGEST SCROUNGERS IN THE COUNTRY AND POINTLESS
Buy the way we know they are gangsters that's why there the royal family.Thats why no other country is going to war with are country so just think of that cos we country are the biggest gangsters.so be proud
We must end Monarchy.   Not value for money.    Wearing fancy regimental clothes.   If Charles cared he would suspend this current labour administration and reset our country.
The Magna Carta is absolute LAW! it states NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW, NOT EVEN THE KING.
Why worry about the puppets they don't have the control over you?
👍🏼🇬🇧
Are you saying that the "French Republic" with Macron in charge is so much better? 😆😆😆
Royals do not bring millions of poynds in by tourism It's a myth and a weak excuse   for peoole to bang on about
Charles is a narcisist  He is  in a high pedastal and we pay for him.
Our peadophile king !
They should,.all of them get a real job..and all the chores...kids after work... cooking... cleaning...etc...and lets see how much marrow the have in there bones...
Seriously? So what the hell did you think were you doing with your life when you joined the army? You spent your life propping the royal family up, you fool.
When the mob gets angry, the French  revolution will look like a picnic
King Charles served his country he was in The Royal Navy Prince Andrew The Falklands almost got killed! Amazing how you remember the sex pistols but refuse to acknowledge Royals that have served!
I agree wholeheartedly. I think the monarchy should be required to dismantle the Crown Jewels and return them to whence they came; but not to the government. To the poor sods who dug it out of the ground. Or rather, their families, as they died long ago from black lung and whatnot. The jewels gleam, the eyes sparkle on the well heeled…but  if you look closely or for too long, they, too, are uncomfortable and bored with the roles they play, world stage. Also, these ‘commoners’ heaping presents on the royals as they walk about. It’s so cringe. The royals should gift them all 10x back, but they’re not polite like that. They’re special, these moments for the royals. Like watching a much older woman struggling whilst curtsying to Princess Catherine and her smiling in delight. Blech and yuck.
I don't have a problem with a leader wearing a military uniform if he's commander in chief.
The end of the British empire was when Churchill paid countries to help keep jews from escaping Germany during the holocaust. Its  like God said,  " that's enough. "
I completely agree, we need him and all oligarchys gone.
👍
TOTALLY AGREE..PRIVILEGED CRIMINALS
Shut this regime down they just like dressing up and pilfering of the public purse .What do they actually do for us they are as corrupt as labour
Charles lost a LOT of people, around the world, when Diana was killed.  If Charles had honored his marriage vows AND if scum Camilla would have honored HER vows and LEFT CHARLES ALONE once he married - Diana would likely still be alive.  They used her and threw her away. Charles once said "I'm not going to be the only Prince Of Wales who never had a mistress".  WHAT A PIG.  Wouldn't it have been nice if he'd said something like "I love my wife and family and I'm going to be the first Prince Of Wales to honor his marriage vows.  How different would William and Harry's lives have been?  I have NO RESPECT for Charles and especially NONE for scummy Camilla who had a great grandmother who was mistress to Edward VII, Alice Keppel.  What a family legacy eh?
Those in "media" in the UK are stumping to get a knighthood....THAT is why they won't call out the criminal cabal.
As the rabbi says; "It's a Sin to be crazy and a crime to be too stupid."
A man is like an art collector. The more of the proper illustrations he buys; the more pleasant his situation. The more of the counterfeits he buys the poorer he is for it. ___ This former British Soldier is "a grievance collector." He's paid top price for a genuine forgery. __ A counterfeit often looks better than the real thing, but it has no commercial value.
Carful bruv,they may try to arrest you for sedition or something akin to calling for revolution
Could you please tell us about the connection with the WEF. And how deeply he is embedded with the  Muslims.
And, what would you replace them with a has been politician like Tony Blair or god forbid Sadik Khan - because that is what would happen, better the devil you know.
The royals need to go out of business
Thats not a shock at all, there was bound to be someone to expose king Charles 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
this Monarchy institution is so strong, far morethan you all think, The more you look the less you see. No onew today can dismantle the Monarchy, you guys dont know the global institutions connected to the British Royals and what the stand for.
The monarchy can mop up the dissatisfaction in the country and take the hit for the people with power. Likewise, they can also use their power to shut down the country, when and if need be. Johnny Rotten was just a patsy, batting off the undercurrent anger, which was just about to burst open before Thatcher and her box of tricks,like selling off council houses and throwing the built up utilities away, dirt cheap. Sometimes, it's better that "celebrities "shut up and go away.
Sure , have a Republic but outlaw the corporations and monopolies first.
I'm agree.!!
I'm from America, and I believe that these inbreds own us too. All the worlds a stage.
I believe this brave man has told the truth! When this King made himself defender of the Faiths, he betrayed the Lord Jesus Christ denying the blood shed for the sins of the whole world!
I don't believe three people in the same family got cancer Catherine Fergie they built the news with that garbage so keep us occupied from finding out something else that they were involved in distracting the public I think none of them had cancer
If William makes it King he'll be the last king
Why doesnt ex military unite into a Peoples Ministry fighting force against the Monarchy. Operation Guy Folks
Charles cant get a job, his hot house education is worthless. Harry has tried and clearly failed on his own for the same reason.
I believe the Islamic invasion is a bigger threat. When will you cowards do something about that? Instead of crying about your king and giving Israel money.
Your a knob
The queens father called them the firm.
The idea of being royal is a joke… I can declare myself king.
You make a powerful argument
Never forget the Chucky's court jester; _Jimmy Saville_
A council house? 😂😂😂 They'd never survive that! 🤪
I was told that many years ago, I was a young woman and didn’t, couldn’t understand that statement, but boy do I agree with you today. ❤❤Thank you for this very informative video, people need to “wake up”
Military Cosplay - nailed it !!
WITHOUT the MONARCHY we Go the AMERICAN WAY 😵‍💫....  Having said that:  INCREDIBLE that KING CHARLES and the Future King in Prince William Support:  the W.E.F. Davos and Co   Heaven Help us All 🤷🏼‍♀️
Just remember that he was at DAVOS for the new world order !The only reason he would be there was to support communism!A Phuket traitor to Britain
O be quiet
Awesome.,Finally.
Good to hear this from a proud Englishman. If you guys insist on having a decorative Monarchy, you should at least get rid of those carpetbaggers from Germany, and confiscate and make public their lands and treasures. Install a proper English royal family, and just keep them for tradition. Like the Netherlands do.
Do they eat human babies?
AND SO SAY ALL OF US.
Abolish the monarchy.
Realy funny character! He is not like any royalty,he does not have petformance for this chair,vomit sense !
Not me I have no interest in these people I don't follow them
The people that worship this group of spoiled brats need to rethink their beliefs!!!  The royals are jokes!!!  Bunch of adulterers and peados!!!  Sick
This is high treason! In another age, you would be beheaded. God save the King!
Tell us how you really feel.😂
They do more now than ever, and still playing the most dangerous game.
As an American my impression of Charles is, he an elitist who wouldn't give me the time of day
This Post is 100% Accurate!  As speaking as an American.  We did enjoy the formality of the Royal Family. But as time passed. We seem to have lost interest.  Due to their poor behavior.   Now we view them. As Abusers of the British public.  So much tax currency spent, to maintain something they don't appreciate!  Maybe it's time for a change?  But only the British Public will have to make that decision.  Very sad and disappointing.
The stories of pedoohilias in the british royal families is enough to make the world vomit
Get rid of religion and sects and start to think for yourselves!
He is useless, not even worth being a member of royal family. I do think, though that the reason the queen held on for so long was she knew how useless charles is. I believe now that the monarchy is no longer fit for purpose. Even though people will say not William. He is just as useless. Talks a good talk but  nothing to show for it. When Charles said that we should welcome illegals into our country and house them. My response, you have thousands of acres, you bloody have them. I cannot stand the hypocrisy of the man.
Thank you so much for this. The people need to wake up to this king. I have.
Thankyou for speaking out.
the king has no honor, he gave up Cristen right and rule all .. he's know the old Jester of court and his king is starmer ..lmao.
God bless President Trump.
Spot on. KC is as evil as they get.
Well said.
People are afraid in the UK of the concept of social equality for all and dismantling of the class structure if the Monarchy is abolished since that is all they know.  They have been indoctrinated their entire lives in accepting class inequality as the natural order of society and privilege as well as obligatory servitude and obeisance.   They will never make social progress and improvement in their country as long as they   adhere to this outdated mindset and resist progress and change starting with removal of the royal family.  They will happily starve and freeze to death so that the Royals can continue their wasteful luxurious lifestyles because they don't matter and the royal family does "for the good of the country". I do believe with the huge influx of migration and immigration, the grip and influence on British Society by the royal family will be diluted and the concept of privilege more aggressively challenged.
I never thought I would say this, but the TRAITOR & PEDO FRIEND & ENABLER means KC3 has to go. His dubious association with Saville and his lies about grooming gangs has finished him!
FALL 🔥
King Charles is a Communist
Thank you for this enlightment.
The crown will have Saville, Noe Charles. Epstein Island and evils revealed all NATIONS GOVERNMENTS ARE Guilty for crimes hidden in plain sight !!! ❤❤❤. Thankyou all truthers realizing you're voice matters. Now !!! WWG1WGA AGAINST TYRANNY!!!❤❤❤.
Thankyou.  This was great.
Look at all those medals on the kings chest.  He must be a war hero 😂 I never knew your last name could get you medals. It kind of ruins it for the guys who actually earn them I would imagine
Freemason, Druid, Bilderberg plotters. Australia should become a republic. I used to be a royalist, who served in the RAN, until the access to information became available that i changed my mind. They are not the true line of the British royalty. Oh, and don't you love how sour Camilla looks all the time.
As an American, i dont understand why, in this day and age, the British people still put up with the royals. They have zero real power and they just look down their noses at the people they get rich off of.
The spectrum ceo makes 89 million a year.  Cable TV bills kill ya but ceo sure ain't suffering
They do pay tax.  What about all the good work they do, bringing attention to homelessness and loads of other charities, sounds to me that you are envious, and then there is the amount of money they bring into the Country via tourism.
They are freeloaders off the backs of your people
Very well said -from your former colonist (Canadian) 😅
Look how they treated Harry and Megan . Then th e y slammed them.   Because they asked to go part time!  I dont blaim Harry for walking away!
Any country that is not led by almighty God will fall. Most nations are currently being seduced and played by Masonry, which is, at its head, satanic.  There is only one true King.  Hopefully, people learn that before it is too late.
Fake! They’re German!
He is not the King really as if you watch Tony Robinson documentary the real bloodline and truth is that Micheal Hastings in Australia happens to be the true bloodline .
Insanity that ppl give Royalty even one penny any more! Imagine Britain if the money had gone to the country to make it better!!
Hes even more unpopular now uk is going down the pan with starmer and king sausage fingers says nothing not a peep😮
😮
The royals are imposters and evil.
Charles is a disgrace to his family, and to the country Keep speaking the truth, Elon. WEF Charles is a disgrace. Thank you so much, Elon for caring about Britain. We have a weakling of a king and a wrecking ball of a government as it’s main purpose is to bring this country to its knees. Hoping Charles takes Elon's advice. It's what majority of the British public want i.e. Dissolve Parliament.  Nuts Bolts. If the King is unwilling to act for the good of his nation then what purpose does he serve in the 21st century?
Sadly accurate
Most of this is absolute nonsense  What bizarre propaganda this man speaks
His brother Exposed himself and look what happened to him😂😂
The french model lol what a polite way to say "off with their ..."
What practical purpose does any European Monarchy serve the citizenry?
Yeah , USA had an issue with a monarchy as well. Not that were any better at this point. Corrupt AF.
yes.
It's all just utter nonsense.
Delusional radical comments like this is all I see.
What about the tourism that brings major money into the UK?
Agree!! So much money they take from the British people when Brit’s are struggling to survive.
Well said!
Do an expose on the 'Secret Chambers' in London where the law lords reside. It is possibly the heart of the establishment, grand paintings of landed gentry, solid oak library and old leather high backed chairs and a banqueting room for daily meals unimaginable unless seen with your own eyes. Can you make yourselves scarce we were asked approaching lunch time. 'The lords do not wish to see the workmen during their lunch'. That was the moment the establishment became real to me. Edit: You might also want to take a look into Prince Andrews exploits in the Philippines circa 2000 - 2012 from what I was told by a chef when in Palawan.
There should be NO British monarchy...... Their family. Has been the cause of most of the wars for a 100 years ww1 was caused by their family And if the Rothschilds hadn't funded it, it never would have happened.They funded both sides unbelievable!!!!!!
They are Luciferien's and globalist who want slaves not citizens🤔🫣🤯
YOU HIT IT RITE ON THE NAIL.
Absolutely agree!!
You are great to state  this
read the book. THE ANTI-CHRIST AND A CUP OF TEA,  by Tim Cohen.  Tells you that he is the AC!
supposedly Charles is a Muslim
i totally agree with you. monarchy should be abolished.
Fantastic ideas royal get a job!!!😊
Don't worth a nail of his mother !
How are Germany descents The Royal Family of England?? Make it make sense??  A corrupt crown organization. Should be dissolved.
In America we call that the irs
How very  very true!!! Please be careful.....they are killers.
What for shaking someones hands  what good is that cutting ribbins its a joke
Big queztion is how did end up with so many WEAK leaders...Charlotte works for Klown SchNOB!
I have never agreed to the way king takes people’s money and gets richer and country suffers!
I have wondered for many years why the so called royal family have fooled the British people for so many years. These thugs . that's what they are robbing their pesants that's what they treat the working class. Like. British people wake up . They wonder people left and came to America. We Americans wouldn't stand for their Shit
The Royal Family owns the Army & when they send these people to die it is a sacrifice to there God in exchange for power & money. The world is been ruled by Gangsters since the Roman Empire.
Time to go Charlie you have let us down...
Anyone from Ireland will tell you about the monarchy and the things they have done and now exporting the evil of Islam to Ireland now that is has completely ruined England. A failing government and monarchy. Labor has brought England down and continues to drag Ireland down with it.
King wet lettuce A wef stooge
The art of war itself from whichever country has been grossly hyped up for their is no war that has ever accomplished peace. Each country that hides behind the guise that they are sending soldiers to fight for freedom are blatant liars. Freedom is the last thing that is ever considered. Greed, power, and control are the only strategies used in war to enslave countries not bring freedoms. The monarchy has been waging war since its inception to obtain land and its wealth and people as well as America. All major countries promise freedom but instead deliver slavery. I have started correlating countries and their natural resources where America has fought for "freedoms" to find out the natural resources were what America exploited and stole under the guise of Democracy. America was formed as a Republic and not a democracy but Americans have been brainwashed  to say the opposite.  Save our democracy is the rhetoric here in the US when it should be save the Republic.  America is unequivocally guilty of suppressing countries around the world through war in the name of Democracy. People do not want to hear the truth, nor do they want to educate themselves to the fact that we have been lied to and used for centuries as mere puppets of the elite to do their sole bidding. America is still under merritime law and owned by the monarchy. They own our asses and we pay with our very lives. Don't believe me, dive down that rabbit hole and research it yourself. This man is sharing the truth that many honestly will not believe, for they can not because the indoctrination they received from educators have only taught the lie propaganda to keep the masses under their control. V for Vendetta is a perfect example of the total control that is being hidden from us all, all over the world. Wake up sheeples and pay attention for one day they will be calling your sons and daughters to fight in their wars.
The Royal Family attract a lot of Tourism which we woulden have without them so the small amount we each pay amounts is insignificant i believe the RF is an assets to our Country -- imagine BLAIR or STARMER or even ANGELA RAYNER having the title od President -- theyde cost us a lot more!!
🎉
During the great potato famine, the aristocracy found it far cheaper to pay the fares to America than import food to feed the Irish. But I do thank the Brits for getting my Scottish ancestors here
And they're 'tenticles' in the U.S and Canada.
You favor the actor Anthony Hopkins.
People need to wake up. No matter what you say or do some will not want to see what is front of eyes. The royal family are fabulously wealthy. Charles has no idea about how the ordinary person lives. He has lived an utter privileged life. But I would not waste my time trying to make somebody believe what I have seen and been told what they are really like. I have and had good friends who have worked for the royals. It’s time they were gone.
IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO ALL: Do your research on YouTube, find following names for yourselves, to find out, who is actually, in reality The Antichrist, and The Real Beast behind all of what is happening in Britain, The West and The World.

Is it true that the royals had a fair bit of inbreeding going on?
Yes, nice. Medium raw?
(1)  The Royals are the greatest land owners on the planet, only 2nd to the Catholic Church.  (1)  People think they trade for oil, diamonds, gold, chocolate, coffee, and tea instead of stealing & slaughtering for it.  (3)  A Royal sits in every government on the planet, even Arabia.  (4)  Why do you think Charles betrayed its allies, the Americans, & hid the Bib Laddens?  (5)  The Church of England is not a Christian church, they worship a man, king.
Look at Charles, he wears all those undeserved medals trying to make himself look sophisticated and brave😂pathetic!
I think Charles is the antichrist. He is the little horn, the red dragon! Charles, behind closed doors, rules the world.
Love this man
Why dont the British people get rid of that trash
You speak like an early american! We still have them in Canada.
When do we get the King on the bills, Pound for pound?
Most of Europe had monarchies and one by one they stopped. England can do the same. 🇨🇦
Seriously just watching the Royals in the last three decades it really has made me wonder what the hell happened to England they're just there for show and they are costing you guys billions of dollars
The so called king is a hobnob scumbag.
Pray against THE EVIL in your nation.     saying save the King..- BUT SAY IN ADDITION: FROM ANY AND ALL EVIL.
The imposters were told not to publically speak to each other in German, while Britain was at war with Germany. That suggests they do not see themselves as British. I'm reminded of the Ptolomys. In over 300 years of rule none of them learned Egyptian language and customs but simply used the country for status and riches. Cleaopatra 7th was the first, and that was likely out of ego because she believed herself to be a reincarnation of the Goddess Isis! With great riches come great delusions.
Bunch of narcissistic psychopaths.
Get a grip...people.
Cut off their funding and make them a self funding, tax paying tourist attraction. People globally still love them, but they don’t need to be a tax burden, but could be a tax benefit to the nation. And their land can be redistributed to local authorities, other than any land and properties they wish to pay the going rate for from their profits, and not our taxes.
I do not have king or queen in human form, they are no more than ME. Only stupid asks for kings and queens.
WEF World Enslavement Fund
Oh my Lord, how is that guy still free in the UK? As far as I know the UK doesn't have a free speech protection like in America. Having said that, I agree with some of his statements.
They take your taxes to make them selfs rich. At the people’s expense. They are  leach’s on the backs of the people.
They bring in $5 and waste $20
Queen Charles is a waste of space!
As an American, I think the only people dumber then a human thinking that they are Royal are the other people around them believing it. I'm willing to bet that they are just as big of criminals and perverts as they have been described over this decades.
Yeah but don’t forget that 60 yrs after the executuion, parliament begged the next in line to take up the crown.  Go figure.
Elizabeth actually served her country in ww2. She is the last royal to really be royal
They are a bunch of Nazi’s. Hiding under an assumed name and identity! Counterfeit tarnished crown!! Spoiled not Royal!! 🤢
And now your pathetic royalty and government are vicariously living out their insane bloody imperialism through the United States and their abysmally ignorant, obese, and slavish population. Like father like son.
Dont worry god is watching. In the end good will prevail. Hell is real. Amen thank you jesus
not my king My king is the king of kings Lord Jesus Christ who reigns on the righthand side of the Father. Your guy is the ac
Which is better, one tyrant 3000 miles away, or 3000 tyrants one mile away? Answer: neither.😏 Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Why? A severe lack of humility.🤷🏻‍♀️
The Royal families should have to get a job because of the most stupidest people in the world and always will be and I’ve never lived in the real world. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
The Smiths....  The Queen is Dead. Margaret on a Gullotine Vicar In A Tutu....
I alway said their just generational dictatorships

And now wef depop agenda .
CHARLES? NOT MY KING! Remember ANCIENT BABYLON! Britain, Commonwealth, EU, America!?? The world is crumbling because of corrupt men! They may have thier time! But they will DIE, and everything they did with all become NOTHING!
The Globalist plot was born out of the Round Table Group, the Royal Society & the Crown. They used war & central banking to slowly gain control of the whole world.
I am amazed to hear you. I do agree with you. & wishing  you all the Very Best to follow your path. 🎉🎉🎉 Best regards
Hes a drunk.
What about the 450k British expat pensioners stuck on frozen pensions despite paying ni all their working lives?
U r so right! Congrats 4 the video! Actually ALL the monarchies (UK, Holland, Spain, French, Austrian - UK being the biggest of all) are gangsters, as they stole all their wealth from the collonies, robbing the populations, comiting mass crimes, stealing their resources, for their own benefits.
Well said
nobility=parasites
Well, my opinion is if you can show that he had something to do with Princess Diana being executed. Chances are you get what you wanted? He would a delegitimize his Crown right then. And there, that's the way I would look at it but A.  A killer's a killer.
Antichrist
"The Royals Bring in Money!" Although this statement may be true, the money is not distributed amongst the "Subjects," it is spread amongst the elitists and corporations. Not amongst the "Citizens" of Britain. Ask the Royals "Whatever happened to the 45 Trillion dollars looted during the time Britian ruled India. India was the wealthiest country in the world prior to the takeover by Britain, only to become a 3rd world shithole a hundred years later!
The Royals are simply better. They deserve all the billions they earn for their hard work of bettering the Empire. And cleaning floors , washing bedpans, helping the elderly, teaching children, welding bridges, building homes….😂
They kill children in rituals tho so tough
They are on top of the 1% dirty world swamp!
Morrissey still rails against the monarchs…
Love this!  Why do We, The People NEED Kings and Queens, etc.?  In reality, these "elites" are complete TRAITORS to We, The People and OUR rightful ”Commonwealth" nations!  In solidarity and common purpose, We, The People, UNITE EVERYWHERE for OUR God-given Freedom, Liberty, and Justice in OUR world!
I’m a Belfast man and as always the loyal people of Belfast support these 100 percent. Now I will not stand for the king as what he is doing to our country and that speech he made at Xmas.  Praising Islam fuck him tratior to me.
You are correct.  We already have a King of the world, king Jesus.
Ok you don’t like the  Crown .  Seems a lot of people do.   Yawn 🥱 I do like your rant, well done😊
King Charles is has monkey DNA
Everyone serves either the true king Jesus the Christ or Satan himself (through self). These “royals” believe their blood has something special in it: the DNA of fallen angels (Genesis 6:1-4, 1 Enoch). I’m not saying it, they are. Look into it!
I am not British but the royal family is outdated and should be abolished. He very accurately describes them.
Britain 🇬🇧 producing useless Barracks Room Lawyers like this is why things have gone to Hell!
Joe , I'm waiting for you
Same exact thing in America with Trump and musk take take take
Pistols greatest.
Yes yes yes yes yes yes😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
And they make such show of serving turkey dinners or whatever to appear as just regular people.   Were MM and PH enlisted to disclose the RF bad acting or take down the commonwealth?
They are the Windsor family today. Up until WWII, they were the Saxe-Coburg family. Churchill wanted war and the Duke of Windsor was an ally of AH and he was the better man for it. Royalty changes their name when their name gets a bad reputation. They wanted to disassociate with Germany at the dawn of the war which was started by the British monarchy.
So I am a little late to this party, posting 1 year after the video was uploaded.  If you look at the history of any ROYAL FAMILY, the commonality between them all is money.  Money to buy the 'means' to force people of their land, they then claim the land and rent it out to everyone, the DUCHY of Cornwall is a prime example of this.  Under arrangements that stem from the 14th century, the King and William earn income from the renting of land owned by their respective private estates – the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall.  Analysis of 5,410 landholdings reveals the duchies have received £11 million from the NHS to rent a warehouse for ambulances; £37 million to lease Dartmoor prison to the Ministry of Justice; £22 million in rent from Thames Water over the past 19 years; £1 million from the Royal Navy since 2004 to build and use jetties; over £600,000 from six leases with state schools; and hundreds of thousands more for licence agreements with three mining projects, two of which are located in areas of natural beauty.  In 2023 the Duchy of Lancaster raised £27.4 million for the King and the Duchy of Cornwall raised £23.6 million for William.  So what makes them, Royal...it is simply wealth and while I believe he can be extreme in his views, you seriously need to have a read of David Icke, the man hits the button, especially about the Royals.
They said years ago that if he got a divorce that he could never be king. WTF?
it's the church of England which was a fake rip off religion from catholism made up by a long time dead Tudor king 500 plus years ago thst made the king or queen head of it! it's all bs and during the baby scoop era of the early 70s the COE orchestrated fast track forced adoptions to highly unsuitable non bios adoptive "parents"! nowadays there's a "list" of shall we say non traditional for a "better" word parents who can't produce their own so get given other loving parents children and imo that is wrong and goes against GODS natural order of the fundamental foundation of the traditional family! madness yet xtrians who follow the doctrines of Anglicant religion AGREE with and condone this sick practice! I am.not religioys in any way shape nor form but I beleive in god 100%! I'm not Muslim but I do agree with their family orientated beleifs and forced adoption wud NEVER happen in Islamic countries! says it all! n now the social workers are harassing my daughters life and it is generational targeting and I curse em all! pure evil
While i agree with this guy on the royals he has very stupid ideas on immigration and is basically a communist.
Just like the vatican state!
I mean we have the foundation of the United States, and all the Rights The Monarch has taken in History and the High Powerful Government control of a Democracy, and yet people forget every day. Yall had Hitler, Methed Up Nazis bent on World Dominattion based on a Meth heads idea of A Perfect Evil. Threatening the life of every single person in Germany, England, France, Europe ect and still dont Allow Armed Citizens. Still havent learned anything , now the one that want "Democracy, and Bueroracy's" dont want to let like se control, Tells not Crap was learned. Geck even in our Constitutional Republic people think its a Democracy when you spread lies on what the totally oppisite system of Government with things that work for a Democracy but not for a Constitutional Republic. To ensure a Free State the Right to Bare Arms is a must of the people. 250 Years and we've still not gotten it. England is a beautiful Country, I've been there. I love the people, there's good and bad every where but we are more alike than different. It's bad ya need a Soldier to tell people how bad the Royal Family is, look at their recrnt Painting, its Straight up, "Lucifer". Pray to thy Heavenly Father, and thy only BEGOTTEN Son, and the Holy Spirit for Wisdom, Guidance and Protection. Amen yall. PS As an American I am blessed with 1st Amendment rights, in a Democracy/Bureaucracy if you offend they can come after you. The Majority Opinions/Gov deems Speech, the First Amendment garentees Free the "Minority opinion " also Free Speech "Start learning your systems of Government." And people in my Country needs to start using them.
I have no respect for King Charles 3.
You sad jealous little man you need Jesus in your life to put some love into your heart this chip on your shoulder will destroy you it’s so sad. 😢
I totally agree with this man !
AGREED 🎉🎉🎉
I agree with everything you have said I have never liked the royal family tell a lie I did like Diana because she was honest and she cared for people I cannot understand why Charles was made king 🤴 no body likes him and how he is allowing this government to treat his own people like crap I have always admired our armed forces we are the best in everything
He's useless and should never bave been Crowned  King.   I find it disgusting that he can help the people by dismantling  (or however you say it) Parliament and call for an election. And yet he supports the dictator Starmer knowing the British people are suffering. But then we have the same thing here in Canada.  🇨🇦 They're all the same WEF pupets.
Who actually owns the crown ? Ive read that its controlled  by rome and rented  true? Or false?
The royal s are stealing are texmoney and they live off are money
Bunch of P..files...Charles a Walter Mitty ..neger earned one Meddle.never fought nothing...cant stand any of them
Sid was set up
For god, king, and country. Their all flushed down the shitter now. Just 'WHAT ARE' you going to inlist and fight for now...
Never heard anyone tell it so well . Rock on mate
Well said  👏
I come from a family of soldiers, turned officers when my father, a WO2 was commissioned a Captain. We struggled, we endured difficult times, we went from working to middle class, effectively. Loyal I'll stay if some traitors decide to get rid of the monarchy.   The French revolution, former British countries in Africa turned dictatorships, and Weimar Germany's fall to Nazism are fine examples of what results from removal of the crown.
You might want to read "Prince Charles - The Sustainable Prince," written by Joan Veon (R. I. P. 2010). Also, you might want to watch "Hidden Agenda," (1990), starring Frances McDormand and Brian Cox.  It was inspired by a former MI-5 agent, and it upset many within the upoer crust of the British government and society ..., possibly because it exposed realities that subjects are not to see.
Liberty and fraternity is a Jesuit term.
Who cares all the rich ppl and gov. Ppl do the same shit boo hoo
I have always know this, rid the old to refresh for new.
I hate Henry the 8th.  He had my great great great great great... Aunt, Anne Bolyn beheaded!  I am American.   You need a new Robin Hood!
You know the Hose of Windsor is related to the Muslim world.   Check it out!
The Windsors stole the crown.  Look at your history!
Charles needs to step down.   He's a cheater with wimpy woke ideations!
Charlie is a Parasite
Absolutely brilliant bruv
… move over King John!…
You have no guns..
Let me guess he likes to butt bongo with young boys!  😅
Spot On
A lot of channelers said that the royal family are actually of the Draco Reptilian bloodline!
Charles looks like, his buddy, Jimmy Saville. That CHROME leaves its mark...
Do you really want a bloke who admits he talks to plants ,to be king
Absolutely.  Get rid of the monarchy and all the hangers on.
The King is a WEF agent.
This man speaks absolute truth 💪
At this point the Monarchy must be abolished. They have been robbing everyone blind for centuries & continue to do so. They have oppressed many nations, stolen artifacts & jewellery, oppressed & dominated multiple countries. They must end.
What a vile bloke you are shane on you!!!!!!!
They aren't even British They are normans
Thankfully the world is waking up and realising the elites we once revered are just parasites and useless eaters 😂
I'm English, he's not my king,traitor.
The royals are luciferians. They worship the devil and they are owned by the Rothchilds and the 13 demonic royal families.
The Brit - Royals look lome a couple of homeless. Specially the wife....One needs to travel far...far throught a snow and jungle to find another  " beauty " as her... .....'m Imissi g something. ??😅😅 Ha. !!  ha. !!
So true
Agreed.
Most US COngress that want war are civilian cowards themselves.
Google Kenneth Copeland. He is a minister worth almost 1 billion. What has he done for the 1.5 million homeless in the US ? Fraud is common !!
Lot of BS!!! The King as well as the Royal Family neither run this country nor have any influence on people's lives in general. The low wage or poor living standard is down to the Goverment chosen by those who suffer the consequences of inadequate governing. The Royal Families, although the thing of the past, existed for centuries in most of the countries all around the world but nowadays don't have any influence on our every day lives. Completely missed and stupid video. You might like them or not but they don't live out of our taxes like some "stupid" causes our Goverment supports with our tax money!!!
Well said.. Demons in skin 💯
Good points but billionaires all over the world do the same. Rich people will always rule !! Nothing can be done.
God will be the judge at their end days .
❤
100% mate
The royal family are satanic puppets
Your talking shit your vile shame on you!!!!!!
Bible Scholar Tim Cohen and former atheist u.s. fighter pilot left the air force when he had a spiritual epiphany. He published his book of evidence over a decade ago called  the AntiChrist and the Cup of Tea. You are correct in your sense of Royal corruption. Charles late Uncle Philip was head Freemason a rich, elite, powerful, secretive Global cult of lucifer worshippers with high level paedo/rape rituals many top leaders/judges/military/politicos/hollywood/tech. billionaires are together. See his channel for yourself. God bless you.
You speak the truth sir  The world needs to wake up..time will come  From Australia
Your prime minister right now is a bloody loser and an idiot
You must mean Queen Charles
Traitor and not my King
They are leaches ! They finished to exist after they murdered Diana….♥️
They don’t care about anyone else except themselves.  I’ve always asked what medals do they wear. How have they got them?  The death of Diana has turned me against them.  And finding out the Queen & Phillip had some children in Canada for a picnic disappeared.  Andrew & Charles have very bizarre unhealthy relationships with many paedophiles  including a priest.  I also look think when the Queen was still alive they had a lot of power with the Rothschilds, etc.  I’m not sure so much now as Charles comes across as thick.  I do believe they are the ones that have power over the government and they make the decisions.   We need to get rid of the Windsors and the Labour government  We need to start again with people who will do the best for the British people
He'll be the last King.  The UK Empire is collapsing quick
I definitely don't understand why the British ppl want these greedy ppl eating up their taxes to live a lavish lifestyle. Poor Diana was killed so Charles could marry Camilla.
That’s 100% mate 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Australian here, I’ve never understood the fascination the public have with the Royal Family. The fact that our head of state is British is ridiculous and that’s nothing against Britain or the British people - I am from Irish, Scottish and English ancestry.  We voted to be a republic in 1999 but our PM at the time was very cunning and divided the Republican voting block. I doubt we’ll ever see a referendum on this in my lifetime.
Absolutely on the nail, couldn't have put it better.💯
7:39 except thats the pont thisnt it it is ours its their....at what point do you say, well this land i bought or fought for is mine amd others cant go on it but the monarchy they have no much land they fought for or bought,  but yet theres is run by the government and all the people can use it and infact any profit the land and even mineral rights etc make go to the public purse.
Always said thePoyals get the biggest giro in the country, probably their cheque equals the yearly benefit bill😮😅😂
….and you have King … 👉🤡👑
Is it true there is another line of British monarchy that was supposed to reign instead of Charles and Co. ?
That’s why America was started
Does K C really have a gold toilet and multiples of eggs cooked for breakfast?  While people have no food, no home.  Good video.    Australia is built on kings and queens of old mother England, local councils and various government departments, look after themselves and continue to tax and more tax the general public people.  These people in various Government Departments including: (DPIE/planning, IPCN, LLS) etc.,, also destroy vast areas of the natural environment/(forests, natural watersources, wildlife species, through their wrong/vile approvals, impacting also air quality, peoples health, drinking water contaminated etc.), through  their disgusting approvals that destroy forests/headwaters of creeks/river systems, for mining, quarries, gas etc., for housing/complexes etc.  Next the buzzwords of "green energy and renewable energy", destroying forests/waterways, for these infrastructures and slaughtering wildlife.  All being done for the new mining boom of solar panels, wind turbines, poles/wires, battery storage, sub stations, air conditioners to cool these batteries, hydro (drowning an environment for a dam, with pipes, pumps, to produce electricity in the Gloucester valley, proposed by Stratford Coal), All these people, working as or for their dictators/paid masters. Including WEF, etc.  I did not vote for WEF or other organisation entities to run Australia, yet sadly they seem too..  NSW Australia
I saw something about the knights of darkness
The biggest  secret is he does nothing  of this present  situation because he converted to islam.  Look for evidence yourself.  Im only  a Watson.
Wow! Brave speech. Imagine if this was 1600's Britain 😮
Only one true king...God.
The royal family is not British they are German!  WEF is German! It all seems to be about one group of people and it’s inter generational?
My favorite Brit🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Great lesson (brief) of history. I'm glad this is coming from a soldier. All we need now is for a majority of the military and those thinking of enlisting to get educated as its these that they use to threaten and keep peoples 'in line'...
KING CHARLES WEAK WOKE TRAITOR !!!!!
You. Nailed. It. With this vid. Thank you. I wish more people supported you.
Do not walk around Balmoral, you might get a big surprise!
The trouble with Cromwell, he invited the Ashkenazi into England, it’s been just as big a curse as the monarchy has the last 100 years
Well worth listening to.
The French Revolution is nothing to emulate and was nothing like the American Revolution.  Being rich is not the problem.
His poggy fingers in all our public sectors pies ! Yes that exaclty how they are ! Royals ow us money ! They got billions ! And as we got educated we started work out there manipulation as got more educated. Sure in history they stood back buming young boys thinking up what medal to give selfs while we was cannon fodder ! Free slaves work harder and better ...
The problem Ducky is that U.S. President Donald doesn't have a brain in his silly head. His brain is in his tongue and it's the size of a humming bird's. It has a mind of its own and it's that of "a rogue Democrat." ___  Now be off with you!
The 13 colonies rightly belong to King Charles the 3rd. of England. __ "Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Glee" was the business of good King George the 3rd. of England. Where George Warshington and his rascals ever got into the "Night Watchman" picture is the cause of some concern.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
The royal family is dead and it was destroyed by the royal family it's self arrogance.
A feel same but also ex squaddie
Charles has nailed his colours to the mast in his Christmas speech and it's not the union flag.
I've been saying this for years . They are ripping the eyes out of us Brits. They don't have billions tucked away it will be trillions. Come on hands up all who no where those multi millions every year go ? And that's being going on for decades . Please Britain wake up. We are heading for the abyss.
There is nothing royal about a bunch of murdering thieves.
Gday I think these people are shit. The work so hard my arse. I will swap jobs anyday. God bless the mad parade
They are oxygen thieves
I couldn't have said it better.
I AGREE. Having "royals" in our modern world is RIDICULOUS, them with of all of their debauchery. It's why we fought our War of Independence. It's so nice to hear someone say it out loud. They are REPTILES, debauched REPTILES and Nazi globalists. The "constitutional monarchy" thing is a veil. Behind it, the "royals," who aren't even British, still have all the power, the final say and have always been doing some very evil things. They even still own everything, and they always have the last word, commands, if you will. I'm hoping we might see the end of them very soon. If the British people knew the truth about them, they'd run them out on a rail, tarred and feathered. If they could see it with all the proof, then, the "monarchy" would be no more. It should be a mission to get them outed in every sense of the word. It's astonishing that the people of the UK were and are so dismissive of the pedo cult thing, even though they've seen some of it for themselves. They seem to be so hardwired to ignore anything the "royals" may do wrong, no matter how evil. I hope they wake up soon. Keep putting the truth out there.
He needs to be locked up in his own tower.  As he’s a traitor to his people
Well, American here, have had advanced excelerated British military training in N.Ireland.   My Riding team were pestered to do training, sign papers to do so, the RAF cadets were going to be training at Osbourne.    We had overkill training, until some cadets got wind of it.   Those running the show managed to get me to do a loyalty oath after agreeing to not doing so with London consulate and incoming Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith to the Republic.   At that time, i could lose US citizenship. I was ambushed by the Ulster Master of Arms, a Bishop of York and their choir boys at Equestrian Centre in Holywood, N. Ireland. I was told to show up early.    They had set up the place with a golden canopy, some expensive persian rug, a kneeling stand , anointing oil from 1953, that was olive oil blessed for a particular occasion that year in Palestine, a whole outfit with white old style shirt, silk knickers, etc.  robe , coronet, etc.    This sounds nutty, but they actually pulled this.    I was told they absolutely required the personal loyalty oath to sovereign, descendants, and loyal friends of sovereign and their descendants.   They spoke of Charles II, the Escape to the Forest of the Old Oak tree, and the need to defend at all means the royal personage and their loyal supporters.    I know this is weird.  When they took out the old Order of St Patrick robe and jewellery, ornaments,etc. i gasped.  The robe was from the time of William IV.  Name tag on inside had name of aristocrat with three titles.  Robe was purple and powder blue, silk .  I told them, I may not be British, but I could tell, that this order, could not possibly exist after Ireland's independence in 1949.   I was right except that the Queen was still a member and Ulster Master of Arms was still her Representative.   Charles III, is the only member today.  I was told this was the brainchild of Princess Anne. I was told there was a attempted kidnapping of her before was unaware of., and she was a nervous nellie underneath, who liked to play dress up in military costume.  I told them, this ceremony made zero sense and was not valid. Why do it. I also pointed out that if the press got wind of it, they would question their judgement in concocting such a plan.     At the face of it, shouuld i demand to be called a Dame?   Someone else did point out that there were no female members except sovereign.    So in the very least, a swell Dame, eh?     A relative of the Queen's thought the whole thing was crackers. He was there, at the same time, to present a Equestrian Cup to my University Team.     Michael Bowes - Lyon, Lord Glamis, thought it was the stupidest idea, and also questioned the plan.  He loved his whisky sours in the morning to the constranation of his wife.    Anyways, don't tell Trump.  He'll deport me to Sweden.  Dame in Distress. S.O.S. Mayday! Mayday! Danger!  To: Will Robinson
Totally agree
Their name isn't Windsor. It was a German name changed when Germans became very unpopular.
Democracy that is the rule of the mob is a lie because it always eventually leads to totalitarianism of one form or another, and republics throughout history have always been the control mechanism of oligarchs be they  hereditary warlord aristocrats or of the loanshark merchant tribe or as now an enter married hybrid of those two groups.
It's about time the British oligarchy were exposed for what they are, what they do and how they operate. They have used their immense power to bleed the U.K. taxpayer for centuries.
This people are (  κηφηνες )
I agree but does he believe that an elected parliament is any less corrupt.  Would he prefer the corruption free American system.
Monarchy  is very anachronistic institution  for the   century  2025
I'm a decendant of the armitage/armytage family and the corruption is real in the medieval days as it is today my family history is embedded in corruption 😊 every war england has had my ancestors was their and I agree with this

The inaccuracies in this video smh
Afraid the vast majority of population are too brainwashed and supine to change things.
Where’d he get all those medals ? Anybody can out medals on.
💯👏
Ban our national anthem. We sing about a man NOT our country
Never liked them, never been interested in them. They rob us blind and we sit by and still cheer them on.
Freemasonay??  A_L_T_I_Y_A_N_C_H_I_L_D_S Mindblowing5hrvid
So many serve so few. Why ?  🤔  This  is the  era of technology , not power.  shame, it's  how it's  always been.😢 we never learn.
Bumbling peasants 😅made me laugh out loud so true ! I love a tiny coffee btw 😉
The Royals are a drain on society.  With every important issue,  they shit on the working class.
Nothing but rothschild puppets for 200 years👿
I used to be a royalist but after the King's speech?  He had the opportunity to stand up for the people against the dictator Starma.  After all he will not be chucked into jail .
All I  know, is that Camila is the most hated shamless so called woman on earth!  There will never be another lady like Princess Diana! Australia should not be under the monarchy! Should be idipendant! We don't need Kings and Queens, these days in the word!!!
I agree but Johnny rotten has reneged and said he didn’t mean it ? I think the worst of them are now dead
YOU LOST ME WITH YOUR LIST OF PUBLIC SERVANTS....TRAIN DRIVERS DOING WELL
Illegitimate to boot, not from the Plantagenet line.
U sound like a knowledgeable man use it to do good. . U serve ur purpose they will pay for their's.
U have many points. God wants us to serve him not false gods...however even if one has power and authority a role model is to serve God too,times of need....Success is a mans stinginess who wants to keep all to themself...written not to follow materialistic things but to use that wealth to help and support others...Man of higher power have too much Pride..
This lad aint wrong
The monarchy is toast and they have nobody else to blame but themselves. They have no place in the 21st century and what you point out about their gangster roots is finally on the record.
God save the queen... we mean it, man!!!
The people in charge have punished us all (we have all worked and paid our taxes etc) stilley hammer us.. all we want is some free time and enjoy life.. they don't even support the workers who are supporting them.. that's silly, who is telling them what to do? Wef or Mickey mouse?
I'm really fucking annoyed.. I say 1 joke on tiktok and get my video pulled down! And this guy says this (which does have truth in it sadly) but his video is still on here 😂😂 why are they punishing us? 2 tier sensoring as well 😂😂😂 George Carlin... It's a big club and you and I are not in the big club 😂😂
The King's as much a nice guy as Trump's a pacifist!
Having Irish ancestry I've always  referred to da King as...Charlie da Turd (III). Say...no...more!
Your spot on mate it’s Fkn disgrace
Wait, wait we need royalty. Who'll kill the dragons?
What! That he is an adrenachrome swilling nonce. Stolen people's money assets and land grabbing since WW1.
Oh we do know what goes on behind closed doors..pedophillia and satanic ritual abuse..child murder etc etc.
Do away with it and let Canada join the USA. The elections we have here are ending up with a communist state and no one is helping us. Supposed to be free!
Yeah we’re still a colony in AU under ur monarchy
So very true I got 50p for that firm I was young and knew very little  50p day to go to war for those bunch of thieving German  what makes think they place
THIS KING IS NO KING OF MINE . HE IS A LIEING DECIVEING ABDULLAH
😂😂😂😂 colonizer money running out😂😂😂
They're Satanists.
People like Charles & Bill Gates are still mere mortals.....thankfully.
The Houses of both Windsor and Wetton wield too much authority and power over the entire world.
Largest shareholder in BP,one of forces behind the 1952 Secrecy Act in Commonwealth and Western countries,Not British,11 castles and estates,sending our ancestors off to fight inbred wars for centuries,etc etc
So how come your the only ex squaddie to come out and say this and why did you sign up to H.M .Forces no im not an ex service but my parents were Army  and an Uncle and cousin were ex RAF And i have worked for The RMPS and with MOD PLOD Nobody had a bad word against The Royals.
Truth
Your a trator mate talking out you but
The royals are puppets, they have no power.....keep digging.
I've not long watched The History of Royal Scandals by Professor Suzannah Lipscomb. It is disgusting how much land, stolen wealth and rent paid for everything that passes through "their" lands? And to receive our tax paid money for their repairs and affairs?? They should downsize, turn the buildings to museums and graft like the rest of us.
I am a sovereign entity. He's not my King ; and never will i. Consider him or anyone so.
Excellent WELL SAID
WEF king of demons
Now they are giving our wealth and lands to people who should not even be here.
What's the annoying clicking?
Nonsense
📣 shoshagesh!
These people are demon worshippers it's a known fact. God wins all :)
Bro you lost me at 2 minutes
Wiping his Snotty nose on his gloves!! Gross man
Thank you for saying what I think, of course you said much better than I ever could 👍
Not my king ,sick evil greedy criminal royal family,
I can see what I see, and I see a weak and feeble man just like Biden who's walking shadow walked a little  too late.
Thanks & good luck and no, I never thought much of him,  the big bird hunter, since that's all I've ever seen him do.
How many of our dead children, were earned by the medal you wear, and how many more will die?
Loved this truth!❤
Freemasons in control. Every country. Every industry. Total control. With a plan to control to world.
Wow, I so agree with you, it's a crock of foul greed, nothing more
💯💯💯💯💯
The funny thing is I don't think the Brits would miss the monarchy if they gone.
Everyone just goes along with the program I like it when someone questions stuff
Absolutely right 👏👏❤
Admit it we americans got something right. We Kicked the royals to Canada. We have enough problems with our rich.
This message must be said..... And repeated often
They, the Royal Family, are the trustee,  executor,  of the trust or foundation,  that owns the Crown Corporation , which owns all other corporations that are within their jurisdiction. All Common Wealth nations, provinces, states, regions, boroughs,  cities,  towns, land property, your personal residence, your car, and yes, you and your children!! All fall within the Crown Corporation,  which they control. Like King George (Berty) said, " We are not a family, We are a firm"
TBH... it's way worse than you think ... unbelievably worse...
Not my king 👑
Top man from a grunt who have said the same for years however i got to pay for my disobedience and have been struck from socieety for years
What do the reptilian  overlords   think about  doing away with  British  monarchy?
Well said, the lamestream media also give Rorters platform everyday in news.
My oppinion about brits has slightly changed for the better
King mentality me me me me/mmmmmmmmmmmeeeeeeeeemmmmmmmee and only ME ,that is a BS great F. For all of those vampires
Sir you are very right but remember one thing England is great today because of the monarchy all the good facilities in England likeNHS free schooling people get GIRO while politicians only grumble and fight how to keep in power I am a Pakistani grew up in England and loved what England is be grateful Britain you have a monarchy that cares for you even if it cost the tax payer long live England 😢
I always said they were parasites. Stay in Britain, we don't need your 'dominion' over Canada. The motto of the royal family is  'to serve' the people. That's a load of bs, since when are they serving anybody except themselves. The royal family should be abolished, that was clear after Diana died. All the pomp and glamor is a thing of the past, the coronation put a period on that. Andrew and Fergie exemplify their greed and entitlement. And Charles and Camilla looked like clowns at the coronation with their crowns. Ridiculous!
Adrenachrome junkies
Are they really from Britian ??
God rules the world because he sets up Kings and takes them down. Queen Elizabeth exemplified the Monarchy with distinction. She had no personal scandals during her reign. They represent order in society and are servants to their nation. To use individuals who represent rebellion certainly is not one of order and decency within any system. It represents chaos and disorder. Which is the complete opposite of a civilized society. Those who propagate such systems are not individuals who truly believe in promoting peace.  We are also to be individuals of forgiveness because our Lord and Saviour reminded us that, All have sinned and come short of his glory.
Australia should have got rid of the British royal family 100years and have the same constitution like the usa
Yep it's the elites and powers and principalities
😂 Love this guy❤
I am so with you on this .
Living off the hard working theiving from your people and anywhere else they could get in the door to fleece
You are so right and they took everyones fucking money theives n liars
He is not the king
The Royals are the World fancy dress champs.
Ninth circle , masons , Satanists , reptilian and false everything significant
THIS IS A REAL MAN! NOBODY HAS EVER SPOKEN TRUER WORDS ABOUT THIS COUNTERFEIT REGIME. A BASTION OF GREED, HATE, PERVERSION AND CORRUPTION ALL BASED ON A FAIRYTALE ABOUT THIEVES AND MONGRELS.
:::::::::::::  4:47 ? "Ayatollah" !!  (by Amsterdamned)
no need for anyone to expose that POS he´s an anomaly
That's why us cymry hate them!they stole our country and made them our royals.they are dirty people.
Music is the sign  With no one singing about how tough life is and why
Nothing will change
I'm a British Subject,that's all
He was pals with saville, that should tell the people enough of what this wretch is truly is
Apparently Charles III wanted his place in history but is in poor health and it will be William. This reign will be short. If you look at Canada, NZ, Australia all who owe allegiance to the Crown the Firm look at how the citizens civil rights abd oerfonsl liberties are undermined in past 4 years. And no one questions who the Elite in large Commonwealth countries take their orders from. The Labour Party in UK takes power and immediately wants to tax small farms into oblivion with estate taxces.
I blame the immigrants 😢😢😢
Hear Hear!!
Yes! Tourists don't come for that family of greedy thugs. They enjoy the buildings shiny soldiers on horses etc.
Lol been saying and known this for years but it's 2024 year of karma watch so much high profile people royals religions corporations celebrities fall truth 💯💯💯 And they conquered destroyed forced religion in the name of God 😂😂😂.... GOD IS LOVE AND LIGHT TRUTH.
What has being s former doldier got to do with anything? Spanish live longer than the French, oh look, they are a Monarchy. Chip on your shoulder, get over it and just live your life
Yess, they are Demons.  Time for them to go!! Relinquish their illegal gains back to where it rightfully belongs, and give England back too as many of the people are struggling and relying on charities.  Dirty people!!!
Yes, it crazy how they call this work. Jewels from all over the place and all their money. I will never bow to any of them .Not my king. My king is Jesus.
No wonder the army didn’t work out
And they have a cheek to harrass accuse  and call Harry and Megan and 2 inocent small children, names , everyone should watch this i wasnt interested until Megan and Harry got married, now i reall despise them theyr the most disfunctiional artificial corrupt families on this earth
A man who speaks my lingo and the TRUTH UGLINESS DECIEPT INCITING HATE, and ridiculous, they walk around in thier bloodstained crowns and jewals, looking dapper in thier  expensive clothes the people of England paid for and still thieving from thier own people,the grassroots real people with real problems, homeless people starving children and adults alike, even if they dont care about anything but english media crowing about poor charlie snd his wife no-one else wants or likes, hes not a fathers rear end , the world are so tired of this real royal winging about WHAT?? and WHO CARE'S, not our monarchy , i feel for the real english people ❤ they need more  publicitythan this entitled royal mob of criminals ❤❤❤ thanking you muchly for your truthful input ❤❤❤
Well said mate 👏
King Charles addresed the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim Al Thani in Arabic in a dinner speech in UK. But Joe Glenton i feel your point.
When I say to people we don't need the monarchy they always say they bring in lots of money from tourism etc.  I know we don't need them, what's a good argument against this point? I don't know all the stats/ facts, can someone explain why that's wrong?
Dismantle the monarchy we live in different times now.
Wow thos man is not all there.  The government is responsible for our quality of life.
The royal family are vicious! I was a royal lover. No more! They will fall!
They are a Vatican hand
I agree what do we even have a royal family for,we make them rich
Take a look at Chuckys and Andrew's relationship with on Jimmy Sivel
Yes they are invaded half the planet and they are the scummiest family on earth just look at Andy Pandy
Look into rio tinto's in Australia who owns it. You must be getting a lot out of it.
Here here.... well said. Illuminati come to mind WHAT WHAT!
You,re wrong. If we didn't have a monarch we would have a president. Someone who seeks power. Unfortunately this Job attracts power crazed narcissists. Not all politicians are narcissists but a lot of them are. With a monarch you have va better chance of getting an ordinary person like you who takes their responsibility seriously. That's why qe 2 was such an excellent  monarch.
👏👏👏 well said
Totally agree. They play the role of caring while evil goes on behind.. worse than any gangsters
STUCK FARMER, and Sigh the PLEDGE.
As a Scot, and by the document that was ratified in the London parliament as recently as 2018, - I am sovereign in my country of Scotland. These people are legally beneath me in Scotland. The claim of right 1689.
Absolutely we really need to get rid of the royal family because they cost us far to much money
After the doings of Charles he is no better than Henry ,we have no King but Jesus
We have no king but Jesus
At last
Please don’t say such words. It’s better to be loved than to be hated. Be the example that you would like to see in this world. You can’t beat them this way. They are way too powerful and have too many allies. You should practice your faith instead and find a more positive outlook on life.
I think that the house of Windsor has been held hostage by the Globalists who run and own London City. A Constitutional Monarchy is a Guarantee in a Democracy that the Crown will offset a Tyrranical authoritarian Regime. The Knighting of the Pakistani of Globalist London City is a low point for Charles.
So we kick them out of power , and there’s no royal family left. Who takes over ? Is this another Russia ? There will always be an elite.
Watch UK out of shadows
Remember that black and white photograph of the royal family doing a Nazi salute?  They don't give a wank about the public.
And And!  A legally required 10 minute DOCTOR'S CONSULT.  IF YOU HAVE STREP THROAT 10 MINUTES  IF You Have swollen toes 10 TEN! 10 minutes I was so shocked whenever I learned this fact I'm still shocked 10 minutes  10. x . 60 600.0 seconds  3:20 isn't Elizabeth some relative to the head head chopper? Muhammad of the 9yo wife 🤢
I've not seen a government that doesn't operate like a mafia. They offer protection and expect you to pay for it. In America it's between 18 and 20% of your pay. Pretty crazy that's right up there with loan sharking rates. I don't remember being asked to participate in it when I was born. It's forced on you like all governments are
As an American I've never understood why the British kept the monarchy around. These people are horrifically evil and sit around and live off everyone else. They provide nothing
You sound like my wife speaking who is French France 🇫🇷 🇫🇷and I have to agree with you.  We as a Nation will not evolve until we become a republic.
The idea of a class system, that the common working man is inferior to the son of a thief or a despot, is deeply offensive to me.  Belief in equality before the law is important to human dignity and self-respect.
Him getting on the throne is the worst thing that happened to Britain then starmer got into government. Britain is screwed. No wonder our Queen stayed on the throne until the day she passed. She knew what he’s like and wanted to give him the least time possible. We will never have another monarch like Queen Elizabeth. I just pray his cancer takes him quickly. Then we’ll find out what our next king and queen will do for our country and our people
Evil monarchy hides its true colours
So true 👍
Yes,one of a handful of people who rule the world. I wont even get into the Vatican!
Disgusting that the struggling British people still feed these pompous Parasites. Lets never forget there origins of taking power was the fact they had the most vicious thieving gangs back in the day. Its time they went
Mohamed al Fayed, Dodi Fayeds father said exactly the same thing about yhe Royals. " Vicious gangsters"..etc. After they'd murdered his son and Diana.
👍🏽
I can’t stand the royal family
The UK has a luxury problem, maintaining a Royal Family with a sumptuous Royal Grand in addition to incomes from the duchy of Lancaster & the duchy of Cornwall. Book recommendation: ...and what do you do?-- by Norman Baker; a true eye opener. They way money is being spent by this family is truly perverse. Shady tax practices, disgusting really.
I regularly cycle past Buckingham Palace and the park behind it lol acres of land we cant see. And not far down the road you'll find homeless
Totally agree brother this country was built by kings and queens but the country is been pillaged by pms and parliament only way we will win is to stop paying these tax’s maybe then they will see they have destroyed its people and economy
I heard a story a few years back, that Charles had been caught in bed with a soldier, the story got swept under the carpet.
When the monorquey is gone English people will finally lose there arougunce within society.
You have to be a real dummy not to see the great benefits the royal family brings us in England. You have to be an even bigger dummy to serve in the any of the armed forces while holding these opinions about the royal family. All I hear is jealousy and bitterness. Former British soldier saying “the king must fall” is treason. If this was an earlier time you would be dragged from your hut in front of your sheep and hung as a traitor to the crown. Ironic was the crown who give you the right to rebel is this very pathetic display.
Abolish the monarchy
The real problem is the bbc and media
I don't like the royal family.. but when I speak to many people they love them! They say "they do so much for the UK and they bring in so much money" but do they really? I don't don't think they do.
Loved that, but did not CROMWELL get rid of them many moons ago?. Figureheads only now. When will they give back Cornwall to the people, these are the poorest ppl in the country and daddy Charles upped their Rents when his debauched Son and his Mattress wife demanded more money to fund their drug&drink lifestyle.  Disgusting ppl. 😮 😊
I fell out of respect for the Royals when the Queen sat in front of a camera and implored us all to get the jab. I won't forget those people that took part in that slaughter.
Thank god first time i ever  heard anyone talking some common sense.
Every day must be a miserable depressing fog for you. Do you hate all kings and queens around the world......or just our own? Get rid of the royals, and the replacement would be Biden and Trump. Maybe you should move overseas so you dont get so upset.
The Royal Family is corrupt and filled with scandals, they are useless, they consume british people's fortune, they steal british peoples money and think higher humans then ordinary british people.
My family in the day signed the death warrant for Charlie the 1st it's something I tell everyone
This man is speaking truth
President Sir Keir Starmer has a scary ring to it.
We are paying far more to black gangsters with drugs, people trafficking and millionair black football players crowding out Irish, English, Welsh and Scottish players systematically. Morons brainwashed by Rupert Murdoch, George Soros and misandry, tokophobia bums are disgusting. These people attacking the royals are Marxist criminals themselves. UK best place to live. Only Irish Marxist republicans are the haters. EU want monarchy gone. Then we have tyrannical mess of EU that sent illegal migrants to murder us with Covid, knives and other ills like drugs and disease we once wiped out.
Medals on your chest you have never earned?!!! Despicable! Insult to every Man who wore that uniform and fought tooth and nails for his/ our beautiful country the real men who fought for us!! 🇬🇧🇬🇧🎄
They only get away with it because of the ignorance of the public. Sadly evil and stupid walk hand in hand.
Correction.. the only face that ever was entitled to privileged looks was without certainty was princess lady Diana and this will allways go without saying.. the rest of the royal family are all fake to say the least and sponging the life out of the uk and always have done..
In order to unhinge From rulers ruling class it has to be pretty much everyone have to do that and that would mean the Tax needs to disappear and a small amount to be taxed early to provide services such as gas, electricity highway refuge collecting free healthcare to be honest any tax Should be abolished after all they’re just printing the money no intrinsic value. It is only the value that they say it’s valuable and people idea to it what you do is just another hamster whale that you get on every morning it never ends and then you serve your time And then you’re 6 feet under the whole mindset needs to change if you are looking for enlightened society for humans to truly take the next step of the evolutionary one needs to remove exactly what is currently engaged. It’s a list but there are key points you can remove and the whole structure will fall apart. People do not need to panic. You will just equate to a freedom. Most people will learn how to manage their freedom productively just as you learn how to manage your work schedules then you will have true freedom, true democracy and enlightened society where you can shake hands cross the waterand cross the planet
Now do a video on the Pope and the Vatican.... king prodestant. Pope Catholic.. The uk if full of these 2 religons yet you just target the King 🤔
If he knights khan in the new year. Its game over for him!!

Ive NEVER been able to get past Chaz wearing that Maroon "Lid" that means everything to  the Maroon Machine fxxing never ,id like to see him attempt "Milling" 😂
You claim to be a veteran but sound like a walt.  As for you saying you became a traitor. Your my enemy so STFU and stand ready in front of the guns
We're all entitled to an opinion  .
Every Australian should watch this
To some extent, but Britain has gone from an empire to not much more than a grotty looking slum.  The kinds and Queens are part of history. Yes in past years they were gangsters,  Andrew was a disaster, I don't have much knowledge of Charles, but William and Kate are busy every day bringing people together, unifying young people and giving people a sense of belonging and cohesion.  You reckon that the politicians are giving you value for money?? Because the people destroying the country are not the royal family at all, it's the government. The only reason Britain has any reputation left is because of the hard work and networking queen Elizabeth did her whole life, otherwise no one would even know where the UK is. It's a grotty country, ugly suburbs mostly, row housing slums, crime, over priced. The historic buildings do act as a draw card. My view is cut your thieving government by 90%. The royal family costs are a drop in the ocean compared to the real criminals...the UK government. As a UK soldier, you're part of the very problem that caused refugees with your illegal wars. So you were killing people,  but the royal family trying to bring people together are the problem. Your logic is rather flawed there chap
My blood reptilian...royals call it blue blood

The Firm.
The time of Kings and Queens lording over the people is finished. They have no place in a modern society. We don't need them.
In Russia, France, where the guillotine was used in those countries their monarchy was the problem. Here in Britain we have the biggest traitors in 1000 years they are our politicians. I wonder if they’ll get away with it.
Why do you have daddy issues
These people are sad. Very sad indeed.  I seriously wouldn't want to be in such darkness such as these.  The lies, secrets, manipulations....poor Diana, thrown to the wolves. This family is lost.  I feel sad for them
Completely in agreement with you ❤
The curtains are closing!
Said it like it is
Mate you are awsome, ima ex twat too😅 rwf. Keep up the good work
No such thing as a British citizen , subjects not citizens.
No royalty since 1500s
Absolutely luv that! I ave an older brother that’s an ex-squaddie n he won’t hear a bad word said against ‘em…even Andrew?! Proper muppet he is. So refreshing to hear some wisdom and common sense on the subject. Respect to you sir, keep it coming 👍😊✊
Top man! Indeed, the palace of Versailles has millions of views still. How about £45 million for the queen’s monument?! Unreal 💩🤬✊
We are one of the best looked after population in the world …be happy 😊
He is right.  belongs to the  British people You should be able to walk through it  and have a picnic.. Wake up British. Is your country
All their Medals, I THOUGHT THEY WERE REAL HEROS ?      Ha Ha Ha, THE ROYALS SURE ARE A TOTAL JOKE, WITH “KING SHAGGER” and his Moll.
Absolute nonsense he’s just a great big liar
His mother was a quadruple triple Goddess
Is this the platform of misinformation???
Well said
As an Aussie why are so many Brits enamoured with the royals .?.I just don't get it.
Yes we know what they are mate.....
If you do your research the winsors actual name was  saxe-coberg-Gotha yes german the real  legitimacy of the thrown has been thrown into qestion in recent times as the rightful king of England is actually an Australian farmer...they are frauds get the the truth out there
WEF Peado King Ping!!!!
We have no king
He spoke no lies 👏👏👏
It is a family business.  The hidden power and wealth they have even though the Rothschilds are their bosses.  They also have the darker side that does not want to be recognised as existing.  The fact that Charlotte is listed as the richest child in the world speaks volumes.  They are parasites.
King Charles is the anti christ he is behind all that is bad In world bill gates Charles Schwab all report to Charles he is the head of the beast that keeps the normal man under his boot
I made to 5 mins, I’m very proud of myself 🎉
Absolutely brilliant narration
Liberace weak power
Kings can suk off there power to have a ronald reagan wet dream of gay power inbred power pedo power suk off power believe in liberty and justice that cocaine is worse than normal dope for tokers
Well said
I agree with the narrative…most people are doing it tough …the royal family has to curb the spending or at the Verry least contribute to  Hospitals and schools
I am from Belfast northern Ireland I must say I like your talking about the royal family can I tell you lad I was on my holidays in Florida and stayed in the Seralago hotel Christmas time 2018 with my girlfriend and 2 daughters 10 and 12 years old and Ghaslain Maxwell came to are table beside the pool and she said she was on maternity leave I said where's your kids she said nothing a that moment I seen prince Andrew and Jeffrey Empstain come down from the upstairs apartments this is a true story you could not make this story up Amen Godbless Madeira 40 40 Liamp atrick Mr CCC? the police and the law and the government and the solicitors are criminals and the people and are children need protected from these people i have been learning about the royal family this has been going on for year's
Get get rid of the royal family
The royals popularity plummeted after Diana died   Brits aren't stupid they know she was clipped for going against the family code
He';s a parasite. as are all the royal famiy. He's not our king, in fact his stinking family stole our land. Vote out. Vote for a constitutional republic. Vote for an independent Wales.
I'm not a British citizen  . I watch what is happening especially in the U.K. and then Canada and Australia whom are still commonwealth countries  . And I wonder why the King does not stop this madness . But then one day I see a clip of a WEF gathering and here is King Charles on the stag apologizing for his recent absence and then it all makes sense  .
All world monarchs are the same and to have order they must go... divide their wealth to improve countries they rob
Maybe oldest guy had his first job ever!
Look at King Charles with his chest full of medals that he earned for fighting in ww1 & ww2 ☠️
I will not bow down to the Royal family.
👌
charles is mum will be rolling in her grave what hes doing
Not my king💯💯💯Diana is the real queen 💯💯💯
When it comes to it who will The army navy airforce special forces.who will THEY stand with.........
They only reason Andy pansy.was REMOVED was because he let it out to the public what was truly going on. And they had to be seen doing something. They are all pissing in the same pot . They could do so MUCH..but just take take take.
The revolution is coming.
What’s to expose, his a globalist, pedo loving, adulterous, climate change traitor
You've pretty much done a supern job summing up my own position on the royals. Show them the door, they have no business existing in a modern democracy.
The Queen voluntarily paid tax from the mid 90’s. She was the only decent royal
Great post. Agree with everything this guy says.
They are not even totally  human laugh if you like but you will see
WELL SAID MATE..BUT ALSO ... BETTER THE DEVIL YOU KNOW...WE ARE SMALL.FISH WITHOUT OUR MASTERS
Cut to the chase Charlie and turn Buckingham Palace into a Grand Mosque,  you traitor!
windsor is a made up name. They're real name is saxe-coburg-gotha! They changed they're name(well, at least george v did)because he didn't want the British people becoming aware that we had Germans as our royal family, due to the fact that we were at war with them at the time. Disgusting!
BRITISH TAXPAYERS ARE THE CASHCOW FOR THE CORRUPT SYSTEM
Nothing will change we all know that
oval family are as selfish as the pope people are starving and freezing whilst they own billions or even trillions disgusting individuals I hope prince william and Catherine change this when Charles dies however won’t hold my breath 🙁
I so agree with you ! The say that they nerve meddle in politics but I think not . Charles is the biggest meddler in politics!
i was too young to know but this man's face was the hideous monster that tried to instil fear in me as a youth and now i see his face again on the papermoney notes , EWWWWWW first thing i did was wipe my ass with the note.
Brilliant video, your right,get shut of em👍
Republic 👍
Hey Chaz, it's called 'stolen valour', and every member of your family who 'served' in the military is guilty of it.
Gangsters tjat couldn't fight to.savd ghere lives just because tjey pay ppl to murder ppl thats not gangster it has to be thereself all they do is buy which is easy & they cant wipe there ass themselfs i belive theyvd got staff for that & tjere a waste of ffk money & also chomos .remember the boy screaming climing out Buckingham Palace
I do not bow to anyone we are all equal. I never asked for them to exist we are in times where they should have been thrown out onto the rubbish pile of history.
Princess Diana,was one of a kind❤ I do not do Royalty ever,I think they all corrupt!..Princess Diana captured my heart what a beautiful soul she was,she was used and abused by every member of the Royals.and eventually taken out! They were in terror as too what she knew and could reveal….
They are total parasites- we are all fools and have been brainwashed for centuries and have been told to place them on the highest ground as they have been chosen by God. What utter and complete bull. We are total fools and perhaps deserve this charade if we are prepared to stand back and do nothing.
How is he allowed to wear the "Para" wings when he hasn't even done basic training , its an insult to what others have went thru and achieved ! . . . 😮
And just how long did it take the British to work this one out.
I don't like the Royals...I am not brittish....but now they have a coward for a king and cowmilla... .another old crumpled joke
On point!
Great talk!! Love it
Is it the royals who make the laws..?
And what about that baphamet worshiping portrait?!!! Despicable! What an absolute 🖕 to the church!
CHARLES IS ALSO A WEF STAKEHOLDER
SPOT ON 100%  ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE  SHADOW GOVERNMENT RUN BY THE CORRUPT WINDSORS NON TAX PAYING AND LEASING LAND AFTER LAND TO NHS SCHOOLS ETC ETC FIRE STATIONS ALL LAND FROM MONARCHY LEASED OUT AND MAKING MILLIONS  TOTALLY CORRUPT
Sorry mate, but our country led the first revolt(not in the 1640's) but in The Peasants' Revolt. And then The Pilgrimage of Grace and Henry VIII quashed the revolt.
Will still never found out why he received a large bag of cash from the Middle East. Because the police decided they did not need to ask any questions 😂. The police and the law is a joke. How can anybody respect the rule of law in this country anymore.
Agreed. Charles is the lethal scorpion laying in wait in the licorice bowl. Just wait for his speech on Dec25th. Rotten to the core... and far far worse.
This man has nailed it. I think our Mounties could regain much of their lost valour if they would simply drop the “R” in RCMP. That day has come & gone.
SCORZAYZEE - GREAT BRITAIN...  YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO THIS TRACK.   And watch the debate parliament had a bout this rapper ftom Nottingham ❤
Coronation chicken.  Eton mess... Ive never been into that shoite! Gives me right indigestion!!! 💩

train drivers earn a fortune mate
I work 60 hours aweek. To get a decent  wage. And yet on my days off  l can't  afford to have my heating on allday. Yet these lot have hundreds of millions of pounds fine foods  best private health care. Waited on by butlers. Meanwhile pensioners  families.  Struggle  to feed. And heat there homes. So many relying  on food banks. So many homeless people in cluding. Veterans. And so what if the royals bring in millions  each year through  tourism. Who gets to benefit from all this money ??? Not your joe public. This royalty  is outdated and needs to be abolished.
Abolish the monarchy.... they are bleeding the public for trillions of pounds every year .. where the public get poorer and poorer every year...  its absolutely disgraceful ...
They showed there colour s when they were friendly with Hitler back in the war.looking after themselves. And is brother andrew befriends peados and chinese spies.
I swear by Almighty God [or: do solemnly, and truly declare and affirm] that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King Charles III, His Heirs and Successors, and that I will, as in duty bound, honestly and faithfully defend His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, in Person, Crown and Dignity ...
Couldn’t agree more!!! You should read The Antichrist and a cup of tea!!! It will freak you out!!!
We are batteries to be used by the elites and they require a lot of power. If they had an alternative source of power then we would no longer be around, it’s the only reason we are aloud to live. Once A.I. Comes to fruition you will see a massive decline in the population as we become more and more obsolete.
Im no royalist, but you're just ranting.
Absolutely spot on. Yes they are "grimey tax dodgers"!
You are spot on they are a waste of space and do nothing
And here I am thinking all Brits had lost their minds. Thank you for correcting me.
I agree.wealthy thugs
Not a royalist but I thought queen was a nice lady.King Charles is a dopey and out of touch.Harry is more likeable and down to earth.
Don’t be silly 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧don’t be silly

Don’t be silly 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
I agree.
you sound like a jealous loser.... to think sex pistols werent establishment funded controlled dissent is ridiculous...they were poncey fakers, you sound the same bruv,,,,,
They go on about the homeless people this and that..why don't they get the appreciation of the people. And give up some of their millions and millions of acres of land and build homes. For our OWN people. And pay for this from their own millions and millions of wages wich makes them billionaires..out of their own pockets...
The monarchy needs to be abolished they've literally outlived their usefulness.
It’s ok this Greenland in the Uk you’re talking about,Stuck Farmer is already planning on building on for illegals
Still like to see Britain the Uk being British not multicultural,sorry
Defo couldn’t see Charles doing Para training
Go an live somewhere else then mate🤷‍♂️ You clearly don’t like it here, go a live elsewhere then, your a prime example of how and why our culture is slipping away.

Careful now - those deluded wannabees the loyalists from Shankill will be after you 😂
Why does everyone think they're exposing them....its  never been a secret, just denial by the public...
I stay loyal .god save the king .
Im ex p.o.w. hes NOT my king. Hes a divorce, had a hand in the only true royal  Our Lady Diana ❤️.
This is the first honest Brit I have seen. Keep going man.
Well said .
Apparently Charles has fruit and nuts for breakfast. Along with a soft boiled egg. The chef provides 3 eggs. Charles is fussy how the egg is cooked, so he tries each one till he finds one to his liking. Same for his women I guess. He ruined Diana's life. Marrying her whilst he was head over heels in love by what's her name. Not only did he dupe Diana but also the British public.
Since this the truth has come out a out how much these royals make at the expense of the NHS, army and many more, for doing nothing, it's a disgrace
Yes they changed their German origin to Windsor during the first world war, says it all
The moon
Charles the turd.
HRH Charlie Chaplin,  Google "the worlds five most secretive organization's" Express artical on the Illuminati Builder bergs Massons ect and you will NOT be shocked because if you are reading this you probably allready suspect this, chaplin and his cohort's are utter filth and have draged this once great nation down into the gutter !
You didn't really "expose" him.  Cromwell wasn't perhaps the best choice as an example of a successful revolution either; he was a psychopath and a genocidal maniac.  His Dictatorship didn't last and it was a brutal affair while it did.  Do you imagine that if the Monarchy was abolished everyone would then be "equal?" The Windsors are only one of many crime families operating in the UK, it would simply be one less.   The UKs woes are systemic, there is more blame to lay at Thatcher's feet than on the Sax Coburg-Gothas.  Even CR-II will still have to ask permission of the Mayor before he enters the City of London.
And "They" are doing Nothing of the Problem that has come into this Country and other so called Commonwealth Countris!
Where's the part he exposes Charles? 1 minute in, I turned off. The guy attacks the Royal Family, yet served in the army. Ok pal.🤪
God save the King!
All true believed this since i was born.
He won't help his people.   He doesn't care
You mean the German Sax-cobergs? Windsor is a made up name
People today take out there frustrations on the wrong people the King  is human im sure he dose his best for the poor  And needy his mother the late   Queen Elizabeth was a good person too they dont  run the country ,its the  elected Goverment  that  make  all the Decisions   people Dont Like  not the King,   so dont blame the King for others  decisions
Medieval rubbish time this waste of money was confined to history
you are a wa~ker  regardless of the past where would you rather live Korea,Russia, China where else would you have the freedom  of speech you have now. ( Melb. Australia )
He played well for arsenal tho hope he scores a hat trick 😅
Very well said. 👍
Devious sponges tye lot of them,they don't give a fxxk about this country apart from the vast revenue the skim off it.
Instead of slating him online with your own perception, try calling him and actually asking him. What an absolute traitor. Your land? Is it fuck.
You can see in his face he must be thinking of his mum
Disgrace,aren't even British??ity black Austrian nobility, couldn't even speak english sax- burg-gotha,changed to Windsor,BRITISH  ROYAL SHOULD NE BIRTH LINE OF JESHUA- JESUS ,they lowered tax on gin and put it up on the ale,and deapped it for eilliam ,mary and ,now weve got a Rothschild/william whose not the son of charles and turn on Harry wholl be legt at the end?? Its bollox just get them in line strip them and make them play the two ballon game till then ones left,bet you it s Euginey Beatrice the f**kin 9 th or something,not fit for purpose 🤮🤮
The King makes the decisions on how to run the UK economy?
Youre just a communist mate.Just amit it.
If we don't have a constitutional monarchy  then there's nothing stopping a despot like starmer having absolute power.  Every single part of our infrastructure and constitution is is  written because we have a monarchy.  The magna Carter which is the most important legal document in the world, was written because we have a monarchy and to ensure no one person has absolute power. Did you know that last year charles gave £1billion in offshore profits to the people? Did you know that royalty tourism is worth billions and keeps hundreds of thousands in jobs worldwide?  You may not like it, but politically and  financially they benefit the country.
Couldn’t agree more.
They epitomise everything that's  horrible about the English its becuse of them and there government is the reasons English are hated round the world they are behind everything nasty all the lies corruption and we all know how they deal with people who fall out of royal favour  please tell me what's royal about them
His Coronation fancy dress party for the elite cost the people £72m. How did the asteroid miss this lot?
I had mixed feelings about the Royals until I saw a documentary about the Crown Jewels. I have never heard so much nonsense in my life yet people are smitten with them.
I AGREE WITH ALL YOU SAID.
Chuck & his slag, wouldnt even make a good band name!!😂
LOVE IT, TELL HOW IT IS MATE
Spot on mate!👌🏼
Check out tim Cohen's the antichrist and a cup of tea god bless you all
Yep
Charles sold us out decades ago
I've been saying this shit for years.R. C. T 217.
This is hilarious! As a Canadian and a veteran, I can relate. Keep telling it like it is!
Try giving more facts if possible and specific examples of the Royal Family, starting with why they changed their name.  They are not English.
Royalty isn't real. It's an IDEAL! The trick is to convince the English Citizens that it's REAL!!!  PEDOPHILES are real though!! SATANIC RITUALS are real though. Hiding behind a facade of Christianity doesn't change it.
Load of bullocks.....
Totally Agree
You need to get a life of your own.  What a load of tripe you talk.  There has always been rich and poor, leaders and ordinary people, and there always will be.  It's well you don't live in a non democratic country.
This man speaks the truth
As for wearing medals they have not earned is wrong. Why would anyone fight for these abusers of power.
They do bring in money mainly to line their own pockets. Total inequality. Absurd.
IF I HAD APENNY FOR EVERY  SERVICE  MAN OR WOMAN  ,WHO HAVE REALLY SHOWING,  THE ROYAL  FAMILIES  TRUE COLOURS,  I WOULD BE VERY COMFORTABLE  TODAY
Charles is not my king and as for the thing they are calling ‘queen’ ! Republic now, stop the farcical monarchy and its gang of hangers on!
After a long life I can only sgree.
I agree with you soldier
The French Revolution is why we are in this mess. It's not monarchy that's the problem it is your masonic government. The British royals are masonic puppets, so they were allowed to stay in power.
WEF stooge.
The Princes trust is a nonce ring. Search frank bruno phil collins and watch the clip. It's been right in front of us the whole time
Why can't you people leave the royal family alone. Why should we believe what you say
I thought Camilla's father was a Major in the military. You all love her for that then.
In 1965 as a boy i joined army paid allegiance  to the then queen Elizabeth, in retrospect 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 more mug me.
While I am not  a royalist I find it repulsive that you would put woke, disgusting anti royalists on a pedestal… dw
Can't get a job because the system is corrupt and they are giving the jobs to immigrants to get tax money for weapons of mas destruction and weare being pushed out of our country. 😢.
Well said. I cant stand them.
I dont listen to gossip. R
Monarchy is outdated.
I'm 62. I've been hearing this politics of envy shit my entire life. I stopped watching after 5 minutes...and the accent didn't help.
ITS ALL TRUE
wow
No one represents us , A  Corporation WEF etc carve up
This is the reason why there’s no such thing as democracy, democracy needs a society of informed citizens who focus on what’s best for the normal person on the street, the problem with most people is they idolise people they want to be, the rich minority, be that the royals, celebrities, most worship either of these, it’s the mentality that has enabled slavery throughout the ages, the minority can conquer the minds of   Most of the majority, it’s not called slavery anymore but it’s not changed, the majority will soon work just to pay for basic living, even slaves had food & shelter, I see the same thinking when it comes to wearing designer labels, paying double for something that is double the quality or took double the work to create is fine but paying 8 times or more for something that’s twice the quality but has a branded symbol on it is totally slave minded, your effectively paying them to advertise they’re brand & feel good about doing it, people just don’t get it, you can never be a free people unless you put the physical & financial well-being of yourselves & your loved ones before others, this is a common goal for all families so making this the focus of peoples thinking will ensure that the general society will possess the majority of the wealth & hence power not the small minority, people need to put they’re families well being first, stop spending in ways that make others rich based on owning the rights to a label, buy value not a name, don’t spend unnecessarily, only then can the people take back power, change the mindset, live within your means, never take interest based loans, interest is slavery, nothing is free, the things governments “give” as benefits are  facilitated by the worthless printed money the banks create & charge interest on, the national debt is increasing year on year, more taxes are spent servicing that debt year upon year, so less available for services, if people don’t change they’re thinking as time passes the masses only get poorer & slavery is the only destination..
The Windsors a fine German family, arms dealers ,slum landlords, toxic waste polluters of their own lands, paedophiles ,thieves (diamonds& stone of scone) Land..entire countries, genocidal monarchs( the famine Irish&Scottish) and indeed the general annihilation of ALL indigenous people ❤
🙏👍🏻😊♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🙏
Well done  man
Always online attacking brittain(his own)  must of been bullied during his time in the army 😂🙈
Where do they get all these medals they are never on the front line risking their lives ,they should be sent to the front line and fight for their country who knows they may get killed
WOW....THE UNVARNISHED TRUTH😊.......
It’s well known that they live of of dead people money, using  (the power of there land laws, )that’s why they become richer during the wars more people die without making a will , and yet they turn up to pay respect to the fallen .
The Royal Family should be abolished.
Ask yourself why the states in the USA aren’t fighting one another continuously? Europe, not so friendly, formearly externally, currently internally.
It’s not about civil control, it starts with personal responsibility.
The royals didn’t create all the people and associated issues, but are blamed for all things not working out for the best?
We want to ditch all politicians and political parties in Australia as Australian citizens
Sounds like an angry antimonarchist who has a lot to say about Royalty, but nothing to say about not having Royalty, does he believe the American system of Presidents is any better or any other Republican type system, before we throw the baby out with the bath water, we had better thought through exactly what we are losing and we are getting into.
Prince charles best friend was jimmy saville, prince andrew friends with epstein, lord mountbattan a know pedophile and prince philip replyed that if he was reincarnated what would he return as was a virus. All that has to b said to b honest. Honouring a human being because of whos front bum they came out belongs to the days of mud huts and sticks and stones. VERMIN
Where are you getting all this info from total Torus EXCRETUM.
The Royal Family holds onto the money and power that William the Conqueror stole from the Anglo-Saxons in 1066.
As an Australian born in the 60s this lot have NEVER had my respect! Over rated entitled useless people! Good for absolutely NOTHING! So many dummies all sucked in. Quite a few disagreements with my English born grandparents as a young fella. Charlie is essentially king of nothing. Church of England has fallen to Islam! All piffle!!
An awakening is needed, this guy is spot on
Just look at the medals Charlie wears. He never earned any of them.
While her majesty the Queen was monarch I considered myself a royalist. King Charles is a waste of space. What is the alternative head of state? Tony Blair? Sadiq Khan? David Cameron? All as President? Let Prince William take over as King. I think he has his mother’s touch.
If someone in society is elevated, then perforce, other people are diminished. Versailles receives millions of visitors annually without a reigning monarch.  Britain could actually increase this kind of tourism with more sites.  QE II should have scaled back the monarchy following Andy's disgrace.  This was a failure on her part.  Sooner or later they will have to let Britain leave feudalism behind.  To put away the things of childhood. The RNLI pays tribute to the king for the use of the shoreline.  How absurd is that?
The royals and their hangers-on - aristocrats, etc. - are a gang of parasites who've robbed the country and much of the world blind for centuries.
The king is no different from starmer from what I see Queen Elizabeth would have supported the people I think .
@7:29 Mistake, you erred. They CLAIM to own. Choose your words with care.
The royals have shown over the last 124 years that they are no longer worth having, people seem to forget that they are really from the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha line and other German families like the Rothschild and Rockefeller Families who run the world today are all one and the same thing! Through the secret societies and World Economic Forum they control us all, look at the U.K. today, we have one of the best Navy's in the world yet they sit on their hands with hundreds of thousands of illegal people crossing the channel year after year, why and how is this possible, because they are told to do nothing! When people realise those Families funded both sides in the World Wars then they will realise it is all a scam and a betrayal of our United Kingdom. Get rid of them now!
Just clocked this ,I have been saying ALL that you are saying and more and I started off by saying put them in a council house and  Make them work . I have said much more  every time I get  Stopped banned then they take what I say down. Time for a REPUBLIC.
All Kings and queens are criminals
Royalty = Trickery, except here in Ireland where I have resurrected the old monarchy and appointed myself High Queen.   Everyone in Britain should award your efforts on behalf of your country with a majestic title, and get rid of your army as only criminals need protection - from the people.  Good on you for speaking truth which has been a long time coming.
Charles in plotting with the WEF to reduce us to serfs is guilty of treason, the penalty for which not so long ago was DEATH
The royal family  were not british anyhow they came from Germany both Victoria and Albert so what the hell is rhe royal family doing ass heads of statel ye sweet F A its about time the royal family abdicated step down and start working for a living ye give each of them a council house.
Totally agree, they’re just descendants of gang leaders, who over the years have married into other gang families, robbing everyone on the way.  We have been farmed like sheep over the years via, newspapers, radio, tv and now phones.  At least we have alternative messages now thanks to independents like yourself.
You have a great argument for a republic but now look at present day with Labour could this doctorial type of government rule in a republic.  There are still greedy narcissists who want the power so how do you choose the right person to lead????? But I do think we need to move on and remove monarchy in the UK it has outlived it usefulness in our society.
I do wonder for someone that CHOOSED to serve queen and country how you now have distain towards the very monarchy you served ?  maybe you didnt quite reach the rank that you so very longed for ? ? i dont know for i dont know you of course , im sure over the years you may have seen blood and guts while royalty perade in their splendour of Pomp. as you know they do it so very well. i will add that there are members of the armed forces that served for many years and was involved in the most horrific battles and yet do not regret serving for queen and country and live by that undying honour, yet you do completely the oposite ?  ? again im not judging you i dont know you or your journey  its just you are very different to most veterans.
I’ve yet to find someone who can show me how the royal family brings all this money into the country!!!…
They do the exact opposite of what the Royal family are supposed to do! This is why we have a rogue Government. Shut it all down!
You  so  right   sir  i  have  nothing  but  total  respect   for  you  my  dead  brother  in  law   lost  his  life  in  the  troubles   in   ireland   he  was  a  royal  highland   fusilear  and  he  felt  the  same  way  as  you  do   i  miss  him   the  royal  family  are  so  overrated    overpaid   and  of  no  importance  to  me  and  my  family   thanks  again 😊😊😊😊
Not very well informed in stead of going off uneducated parliament make the rules what a dick
THE MONARCHY IS GARBAGE
They say a society can be judged by how many are homeless and how we look after the aged and children, well looking at that statement its a huge failure 😢😢😮😮 😊
Must really be awful being a foot soldier 😕,  often fighting for your life, dodging shells bullets, then loads of digging 👍!! Long hiking with heavy loads,  makes being a cook a good choice!! ❤❤❤❤ 😂😂 😅😅 😊
However is in charge of Royal publicity is woefully out of date.
A man after my own heart.....
That former British soldier is a TRAITOR
Interesting stuff..made me laugh , you sir have brazen charm and don't mince your words..you make sense..but I would argue that the only way to make change is by education..but that is another story..
Fake woke king and good mate of Starmer and Sadiq Khan and why is he allowed to wear all those military medals when he hasn’t even earned them.
LEACHES, nothing more, nothing less. That's all they will ever be.    Just stating the obvious!!!!!!!
You need to show evidence of how ...where and when you devoloped these views.
Spot on.
The president idea means you pay for maybe 5 heads of state . So the cost is even higher than a monarchy. Further Presidents too are not always honest with many only protected by their high office. And pretenders sometimes falling just before being elected. No system is foolproof.
Dianna was the real person.
Yes!
Spot on vid mate and the same goes for the entitled conservatives
Never any comfort In the truth 😢 Walter Mitty😂
2 YEARS AGO I WOULDN'T HAVE CLICKED ON YOUR CHANNEL, YOU HAVE A CONVERT
So glad many are waking up to this monarchy bullshit. 😎👍
We know what monanacy are we do our research lol we are near the unwashed 😮
Well said. We need to get rid of Fundng the Royal Family
About time someone came out and exposed these scumbags for what they are.The royal family are the most disgusting section of our evil ruling elite.I hate and loathe them personally and what and who they represent.
Criminals terrorists like putin for example!,use propaganda to enrich themselves and perpetuate in power .Very simple and easy way to fool consumerist of any kind of rubbish.
My only caveat regarding republicanism can be summed up in two words - Donald Trump.
Our Royals have perhaps, more power than may realise. I agree, it's time this outdated "Put on for Show" circus was got rid of.
As a former soldier, you drew a paycheque for "fighting for king and country" you were probably very proud of that. If you were a good soldier, you followed the chain of command. Rank comes mostly from who the officer knows. Families have rank over others. It's always been that way. U.K. folk will judge a person by his accent, putting him in a certain neighborhood. How do you get around it?
Brilliant video. Long Live UK Republic
Spot on
Love Diana hate charles
great video
He is a total disgrace and you can see were Harry gets it from.
All monarchies are an insult to the human race.
Saville starmer.etc all had something over him.i wonder why he does not get behind his people and oust starmer.maybe we should become a republic
Respect to you brother 🙏 💯
All their money should be given back to the people of this country. He and the rest of them should go through that open door, 2 Tier Kier has open, with his Bliars and don't come back.
Would you rather have a President who has got complete control, no thanks  if your not happy go & live in another country. Your a disgrace to your & my country
So you want your people to be proud of their revolution, but Americans can't be proud of theirs because you are annoyed by that. I like this channel and what it stands for, but I won't put up with any more narcissists like the man you had on in this video. I'll unsubscribe and be done with your channel. I'm an American and I'm definitely not the biggest fan of our government but the revolution was a great time in our history and may soon repeat itself with the way our government ignores what we want done over the Palestine Israel issue and several others. If you want Americans to stay on board, then you need to quit trash talking them and focus on the government. Tired of the people who fight for true freedom, the freedom of speech and justice on a global scale in our country not getting any kind of recognition for what we do, were just grouped in with the rest and called a terrible country. Well if a government makes the country then we're all 💩
But if we had an elected head of state, who would the British electorate vote for? Boris Johnson? Nigel Farage? Or someone even worse?
Ever see the photo of him being prodded in the chest? The regicide Cromwell was financed by similar characters, allowing them in to get busy in the City.
I'm Australian and it's the entire existence of the monarchy in our lives today under a constitutional monarchy here which gets me. They don't care about Australians because they barely care about their own citizens...
"tHatS hOw thEy fOunD thEir wAy iNTo pOwEr" -🤡 Why don't you look at some history or their family tree instead of your imagination
He is a traitor to this country and should f*ck off to America if he doesn't like it we have no room for those whom an oath means nothing to
When the British Monarchy falls it won't be with a whimper but Cataclysmically the more Charles simpers the worse it will be ( the last time Diana, was on the balcony at Royal Albert Hall before her divorce I had a vision in a trance  of the future of Royal family, Diana's murder was only the beginning, it is the Royal children george Charlotte Louis who will suffer most and terribly)
Here Here
You openly say a lot about the royals that a lot of people dare not speak about .  There are a lot of Mafia families in this world and they are just one of them .
This guy is right on  , the people love the royal family while they starve and freeze to death  ,stupid people
True talk😮
King Charles is a snake a man with out morals, Compassion, JUST selfish uncareing King .... King Charles need to remove himself from the royal family and go off to live with Cowmila it what KC Has always wanted to for it KC make the world HAPPY 😁😂🎉
Thank you for being strong enough to deliver this content ,i rember you from years ago ❤ strong
The British royal family died when Queen Elizabeth passed away; she was the last monarch, the whole family are a piss-weak self-serving pack of arseholes. I laugh when I hear the word 'royal' what they really means is 'boil on the arse of humanity'.
Finally someone in the UK tells it like it is, instead of the more typical raving about how wonderful it is to have a hereditary monarchy.  He is exactly right on every single point.  It is truly appalling in this day and age the UK is willing to bankroll royals.  Get rid of the a House of Lords, and the kings and Dukes and Earls, etc.  everything they have they got from pillaging and plundering and stealing land, etc.  The gangster Windsors, the royal mafia!  100% agree.  You do not need them.
Charles is just a front for WWF , he was yalking to Davros apparently!
We should get rid of the monarchy.
The ONLY FAMILY that aspires to live and breed on state welfare benefits is THE ROYAL FAMILY.     A vulgar celebration of inequality.
I think I agree that we should be more European about our Royals. Let’s get back into Europe and do something about it.
long live the king to hell with a republic
Thank you for this video. I have been an opponent of monarchy since I was a teenager. I am now a pensioner and I am tired of people blaming the older generation for the continued existence of this outdated institution. I believe that is what is generally known as 'shifting the blame'. I would urge anyone who feels strongly enough about the need to abolish this scandalously expensive and outmoded institution to join the group Republic.
Matey,i agree with some of what u rage about,but Harry & brother both served in Afghanistan, Charlie was a  naval captain,duno if any good!? AND THEY HAVE NO POWER, IF. U ELECT HEAD OF STATE THEYL THEN WANT POWER,i think we have enuf lunatics in the asylum Eh.
Don't ever compare them to gangsters.  A real gangster gets out there and gets their hands dirty to establishthemselves. These people are suits who were born into privilege,  educated with a machiavellian ethos. The literal "silver spoons" in their mouths. And wield that power true. There is a difference.
I found your channel today. Your leaders are just like our leaders in the U.S. THEY ARE OBSCENELY WEALTHY, ACROSS THE BOARD. They do not give a shit about any of their constituents that are homeless and hungry. Or all the people murdered in the genocide, for the past 74 yrs. Your words are I mportant.
I’ve heard that Jimmy Saville was considered “untouchable” because he knew too much about Mountbatten’s sexual proclivities. (He was very fond of children, as well as young men.) And guess who was the mutual friend of both Saville and Mountbatten.
Worst of all, both the Duchy of Cornwall and the Duchy of Lancaster make millions each year from charging RENT to the military for use of ‘their’ land; millions in rent from hospitals, Councils, the NHS - all these institutions charged millions in acts of literal extortion. It is vile, cynical hypocrisy
I’d never seen that joker in the arab garb!!!  The monarchy is on it’s last legs here in Australia
Agrèe
King Wing Nut. Fun name for a  joke. Cheers
I can not believe the day has come that I will hear the truth from British subject. Hat off mate
Charles Antichrist
Power to the people down with the king  🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧✊✊✊✊✊✊
Charles is the antichrist to come.
Wat Tyler was another one
Lot of people don't know about the wild parties Elizabeth used to throw like p diddy
We call it the P. Diddy mansion Elizabeth was a Bed warmer 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂Nothing new The citizens are stupid for taking care of these fools
ITS white supremacy on steroids.....
When Rothchild was photographed pointing his finger at Charles that showed me who really running things!!
90% of the UK is owned by 1% of the people!
I actually pissed myself laughing when the adulterer and his mistress where swanning about in that coach with big stupid crowns on there heads ?  LMFAO
Charles behaves like the kid who waited his whole life to receive inheritance / crown and yet no one cares.   Delighted Australia rejected invites and ignored them recently
Treason
Many heartfelt thanks to you, and your colleagues, for your service, past and present. I find it very difficult to put into words how grateful I, and I'm sure, the British public in general, feel about the very, very brave men (and women possibly) who have, and still do serve our nation to help keep us safe. We owe you all a great debt and I know that many of you will carry very painful memories, and worse, for the rest of your lives. You are, indeed, the very best of us. You, and those like you, are the REAL Royalty.
As an indian, it is amusing to hear the British Left fantasize about taking down their monarchy and eating their wealth by sharing it amongst all working class and poor Britons. The wealth in question was stolen from us. And from other colonies. It belongs to us. You wouldn't want to use our stolen money to pay your bills now would you? Nah you're better than that. Come on. Give us most of it. Spread it amongst all British colonies. You can have what's left, if any. If you keep it for yourself, then you're just the new version of your Queen lol. Stealing from a thief is good only when you return what was stolen to the victims of the theft in question.
The English royals are the backbone of European Judeo-Christian Zionists in Europe and the World, that is why the uk government and the King have supported Israel's genocide in Gaza
Has his man ever been psycho analyzed?… It’s obvious when you look at his eyes he’s not quite sure what he’s talking about.
Spot on..!!
Spot on Sir 👍
"Inbred morons" 🤣🤣🤣
Rape tape
Why do you want to do that..that is in the past —- long gone!
The royal didn’t really bring in the money. Look at France as an example. They got rid of their royal family. France had 100 million tourists in 2023 whereas UK last year had tourist 31 million tourists only.
Yes, this country needs to be a republic. The royals form a front for a top-down authoritarianism that seeks to maintain the ingrained priviledge of elites. If we could topple that system and 'level' society, everyone would benefit.
He (Charles) should abolish the monarchy..its just a soft colonialation of its own people in disguise....
You Sir, are a Traitor!
In his world, king charles, it's still Medieval, he sooo wealthy and dam all others, does he really know it's 2024? 😅 And we're I live Australia 🇦🇺, the sooner we become a Republic the better, they are living antiques and many many can't stand them 😊
We have got a forg and a cow and we don't need the royal family do away with the royal family
The royal family are not worth the money they get paid they should do a day's work and earn there money do away with the royal family
You are drinking waaaaay too much coffee.
As an Irishman I absolutely agree fuck the monarchy (if you give us Northern Ireland)
charles was jimmy saVILE'S most intimate friend, despite all the intelligence and secuorty lavished upon this cabal....filth, filth, filth.
Royal farce! What are his metals on his chest for! I didnt know he was battle hardened.....maybe theyre for sensorship...
If public opinion doesn't have a more negative vision of the british royals it is due to them being protected by the sionist lobby.
I think it's weird when they wear the uniforms when some never severed. They are just figure heads! That don't have anything to do with politics. Im from states and feel like where else do you see the pageantry. Plus Charles had always talked about and has come through with slimming down to working royals to a small group and everyone else has to get jobs
The republic of England!
Coronation.. bring on the sheep : (
Fgs no one cares , give it a rest x
They say what they are told, but thereafter it's back to living in palaces. So so out of touch with the majority and can easily be bought
Royal families alliance is where their millions and billions of pounds are kept abroad
Fighting for Queen/King and country, basically means you will fight and highly likely kill innocent people for the above mentioned. This makes people serving in the services complicit to murder. All under the name of power.
You’re awsome mate
TRUTH ... TRUTH... TRUTH... THEY WILL FALL.  REVELATION DAYS COME FOR THEM ALL.!
Pure abuse of power !!!  Look at pedo andrew so royal !! Abusers !!! Hypocrits !!!  Wearing rat fur cloaks !!!
"Oh! I was only going to embarrass him!" - Charles
Seems to me you are calling for violent revolution and mass killing and a societal progression ?
Who do you want to lead the armed forces?, it sounds like you want a soldier to be head of the armed forces I.e. a military dictatorship .
If you know your history the French Revolution unleashed mass killing the reign of terror. And follow quickly by a return to monarchy with  Napoleon.
The problem is the media has done a good job of brainwashing people and diverting the attention from them to those on benefits, and working class who use food banks due to the cost of living as been a problem to the system, while these people are getting pay rises and everything paid for😂
Blah blah blah we know what your worldview and ideology are from.
God bless your heart! Join your Irish brothers and become a republic!
I know your Majesty, let's knight them. Yes Hughes, if we knight them, they won' mock us. Sir, I knight you Sir Square Pants and that squirrel Dame Sandy.
This man is fucking evil he has abused me psychologically for 16 years no one will believe me they say I'm crazy im not he is a thuggish clown and he has destroyed me he controls me and my whole life I'm 29 years old  for being such a psychopath there's nothing I can do
How right this man was ,the king has turned his back on his people,if he had any balls he would disolve this government,ASAP.
I am a republican and thus I agree that the UK should sack the royals, but going back to WW 2 the royals have served.
At least William the  conqueror  fought  for his  loot unlike these posh soft shites
I don't know of anyone who likes Charles
The royals Do bring in money.....FOR THEMSELVES..
Good video
There is a letter on record that Charles wrote to that Turd Sir John Kerr conggratulting the BASTARD after he DISMISSED Prime Minister Gough Whitlam in 1975,the Governor general was acting in concert with MI6 and the CIA to subvert Australian democracy! Republic now.
I know. However I still understand that any given government crown or church inherits the problem's of the ones they take over for. It is up to them to solve it before it has past on to the next. So maybe William may be given less burdens that Charles may yet solve. Then of course a druid speeking about Christ and casting war for profits. And a the church of Rome not following its mandate to not hide prists accused of crimes. And a government that seams to mostly hold a value system that is designed to let the peoples struggle for abundance.  I realy though belive its not only them its a interwoven handshake deal of past generation's making promises to future generation's.  And this old Man wouldn't rather ride a old war horse.  Yup I know the world is living a lie and the fix is in. Justice is not just from the might to force us to exept thier idea of what is right. It is in the day to make it right. Then I hear he is trying to push a law into place that you can't speek out against him. Long live the Prince. The truth is that is a Rothchild deal that blackmaild a power top deal. Then a Trump is full of the spunk that was supposed to go in the captain's trunk.😮 Wonder if he got Clinton's pearl necklace to.
Yes, the King lives at a high economic level and good for him, but so do many footballing blockheads. Let's not envy and criticise the wealthy, but enjoy our personal pricelessness instead. Or at least find out how to do so.
I'm British, born in London, seeing the country deteriorate by the day and I can barely grasp what this terrible gabbler is saying. Having been a soldier is no excuse for really bad dellivery. Not as bad delivery as Tommy R., who does stream of consciousness stuff, though. One should speak slowly, clearly and respectfully, making one's words count. ('count' = meaningful).
Ramblings of a schizophrenic. What a load of bileous babbling, sheesh.
The monarchy is a modern day absurdity.  Ever since the death of poor Princess Diana, I have no respect for Charles III.  As an Australian, I think it is high time we became a republic !!!
You can make exactly the same video about the Dutch.
William won't have a country to be king of the way things are going
Now. It seems the king has sold England
Thanks for a great show.
HIS FIRST JOB IN  OVER 70, YEARS AND THEY GOT THE  NECK TO CALL USELESS EATERS.
This fella after his 15 minutes of fame.  Knows the Royals can't or won't answer back.
I would say the majority of people in this country do not care for them
The Queen was executed in 2021, Phillip was executed that year, a few months before the queen. They are all gone.
The King has no power.  Unlike Putin, Respected Comrade Kim Jong Un, and Alexander Lukashenko who were ' voted ' into position.  Our Country is not a Kingdom, but a Commonwealth.  That happened when the Roundheads took over the Country  ( 1642–1651 ) These people were Parliament, from that time no Regent has controlled our Country ( Charles II was only a puppet ).  This didn't work, and Parliament realised there was a need for a two tier Governance.  Nothing has changed since them.  The Monarch is allowed only to comment and make suggestions.  Later, land, buildings, weapons, transport etc which was owned by the Gentry was taken over by the common people.  The detail was, to maintain the Country's history - the land , buildings etc - and stop it / them falling into disrepair the State ( on the  people's behalf ) would pay for the upkeep of the buildings etc.  So maintaining OUR Heritage.  Parliament decided that there was no point in maintaining empty buildings, so they allowed people to live in them.  As an ex soldier, I assume you feel that having a King and Queen sitting in London during WW2 meant jack shit to the soldiers from the UK, USA or the Commonwealth.  None of the people in London looked at a newly bombed office block, then looked at the Palace and thought 'I am not in this alone, we are all together. '  I would ask you to visit Windsor when the Gurkhas' are on duty.  Please, watch them match from barracks. I guess you never felt the same pride as they do ?
God bless the people of Britain with freedom of speech 🎤  Freedom of religion  Freedom to protect your family.
Remember William Tindal- Freedom to have the conversation about the state of the people’s affairs…
America 🇺🇸 Freedom of Speech 🎤
Everything they own was robbed , looted and piliged from around the world.  And still they continue with there evil never-ending wars  !!
100% correct.
Peaky blinders  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA Love it.
💯true and more to come sure😂
There’s a ducmentary on youtube about the Dutchy of Cornwall well worth a look if you have the same sentiment as the majority of the comments here.
I know nothing about British Deep Politics, but this is fascinating.. and I need to know more.
Hardly a credible 'sorce'. A deserter from the British Army. I don't know how he dare bang on about being ex military. Yes, I did serve myself and no, I'm not trying to dine out on it like this man!
That's why the queen stayed queen for so long no confidence in Charlie
The Monarchy once loved and respected. Not so much now since their betrayal of the people.
The British monarchy are outdated, over pampered & serve no worthwhile purpose, to those of us who live within the Commonwealth.
I`ve always wondered how Charles and the rest of his family earned the medals on their military uniforms?
Never been a royalist, so I left and went to Canada, but the upper class are happy to be subjects, but that is changing. The new generations are not royalist, even though to become a citizen of Canada you have to swear aleigence, but as far as most are concerned that a british thing, something of the past and is not important. I personally look forward to the years when we might become a Republic...
Couldn't agree more mate. Why is it that some people want to grovel and scrape to those who were just bigger killers than their own ancestors. And don't get me started on the 'national' anthem. what's national about it ?  Time we did away with these scroungers. Fat chance.
Good on you Joe Glenton
What a winger
MasyaAllah, u should make more podcasts on topics like this brother👍🏻 we muslims know this family is trying to control the politics of the world with such cult, they dont scare us.
Brilliantly spoken
Always sang the national anthem. Never again. It's time to call these privileged crap out. Turn Buckinghsm Palace into a Mosque . He is giving it them.. We dont need them.
Just look at Charles all decked out with his fake medals and uniform, you can tell by his body language that he doesn't buy the charade and all the BS that goes with it. Fat fingers indeed!
Can't say you're wrong.  I have researched that the "royals" are members of "The Committee of 300."  This in current times has the WEF, the UN and the WHO all fronting for the Committee of 300. It's worth looking at. The Globalist Agenda is that committee's goal. Klause Schwab, Bill Gates et al. It is a long list. I have read through it - believe me it's horrifying.  Good luck, mate.
As a time served former soldier, I agree with you 100%.  Unfortunately most serving soldiers seem a bit misty eyed when it comes to this bunch of freeloaders.
Correct.
King charlie is a plonker  Hell bent on destroying a country  With green shit !!!!
He’s spot on. The monarchy are a load of scrounging parasites and sexual predators who’s wealth and influence protects them from  the law that only applies to the rest of us
Jon Wedger ex Metropolitan police officer exposed how social worker system and mental health and police are used to forcefully take away children from loving parents using LIES. Where are the riots against this evil???
You traitor, you sicken me and all veterans......you swore an oath to protect the monarch
It's fundamentally wrong  that poor people are paying for rich people's weddings and funerals.
God bless you ❤❤❤
British democracy! It's a class war! And the rich are squeezing the poor people of Britain to submission!
That former soldier is a TRAITOR.
Very interesting perspective. I keep thinking Royals should be doing real charity at this day and age. And Andrew doing time ofc. But its one perspective. I think the death of QE2 is a huge landmark in the history for royals. Im surprised people dont regard her as the last monarch. Like how? Times change. Its just a perspective of course and i ve been to britan a handful of times so there you go.
Henry the eighth was born almost 3000 Years Ago Way before there were roads an endless supply of trees no tams no children no wives and his name was just Henry. He lived and died in a palace and he was buried in front of that palace where I do believe, his body is still there here with 6 foot two curly black hair and yes, he did have a fountain made that only had wine coming out of it, your history of Botanica is full of 49% truth and 50% lies.

Love  you  freind  i have  been  waiting  fir  decades    for  someone  like  you  to speak  the  truth   abought  that  shower  off  a  family   if  a  war  came  to  england  thay    whould  shit  themselfs  thanks  man  and  thank  you  for  your  service  respect  from  my  heart    and  feom  scotland 😊😊😊😊😊
The Royal Bloodline has been fraudulent since 1261 due to illegitimate king  there was an affair with an archer while the king was away fighting in France so the whole bloodline has been compromised since then!  We have been living this lie for centuries.
Mate you can't do anything about it.. Stop trying to incite anarchy
Mate he didn't choose this life... Listen if he didn't have to be wouldn't
How dare you talk about our king like that
My husband was in high school and because of a high marks in his province  (or something like that) he was chosen to meet the Queen. He told them “No, he had to chop wood that day”. They asked him in disbelief that he would rather chop wood than meet the Queen….he told them yeah lol.
The title is clickbait for sth. much dumber, interesting!
He's not king but a mere puppet.
sausage fingers 😮
Spot on,what is the point of them? Other than to perpetuate the class system.
“I do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors, according to law. So help me God”. Every British sailor, soldier and airman take this oath on joining the armed forces.
interesting ive only found him HRH polite and courteous.
He is not very worldly living in his royal cocoon. Green as they come so little appreciation for how prosperity occurs. Spare us speeches telling us how to live our lives. Nobody except fools worships ordinary ppl adorned with jewels, what a wank.  Charley ought get a job and be a normal person as there is nothing special about any of them. No useful inventions or contributions whatsoever, under par really..
Couldn't watch this with constantly changing images and strange background music.
Don't forget their Bishop's. That enable their supremacy as god anointed. Invisible sky entity.
Costumes.
So, you don't like them then.
Are you anti-UK's King and Queen.  You know King and his monarchy dun work. So you want to bring revolution like France  ???
A sad bitter failed soldier. Achieved nothing in his life. Charles III did the full Parachute regiment course including jumps. Also a Sea Captain, and helicopter pilot. This oxygen thief never had the guts to do any of that. He's just a failure in life, and a scumbag!
He is the ANTICHRIST
Well, pathetic series of nonsense. If you were in their place, you would share it with the world. Envy and greed are seething!
What is your suggestions for us to solve the issue... remember, once the kings gone someones got to be in charge... ? Im interested, honestly...
Tim cohen wrote a book called the antichrist and a cup of tea Charles  coat of arms is the exact same imagery for the antichrist in revelation in the Bible
What so you mean "exposes". Bro was in the RLC he was nowhere near the Royal Family let alone the frontlines of Afghan 😂😭
Thank you 💚💚💚💚💚
THE WEST ROYAL LUCIFERIEN FAMILIES TIME IS UP!!! YAHSHUA    YAH/GOD 🙏 ALMIGHTY THE BLACK MESSIAH ! THE   2ND  COMING ! THE KING 👑 OF   "  AU/UBAK   "   (  UNITED BLACK AFRICAN KINGDOM   )/   "    UBAF   "  (  UNITED BLACK AFRICAN FORCE   ) ! ! !
"family if inbred morons" looooooooooool
King Charles' swollen fingers is a medical condition, whatever your opinion of him as a person or institution, it's pretty low to use someone's illness as a slur.
Sounds sad. Imagine what a human would be capable of in that kind of position. People without power and titles have changed the world for the better. Why couldn't these people do it? Excuses only work for humans but they wont work in the end with God. If you're right about what you say i suppose i should be grateful im not them.
Getting rid of it, whats left for the Brits? All gone
Deluded. You'll get rid of them and then replace them with another bunch of "elected" thieves and gangsters besotted to the rigged international fiat banking system... look at Romania.
We never hear either of  the two main parties in their manifestos about the WEF, WHO, AND UN, UNELECTED GLOBALIST ORGANISATIONS what they are upto, if we vote a government in to serve the British people and the civil servant's not the NGOs😊
Nigel Farage stated if he's in parliament he wants no interference from the WEF, WHO, AND UN, UNELECTED GLOBALIST ORGANISATIONS 😊
I heard a rumour about all the farmers that the  WEF wants to close down 👇  KING 👑 CHARLES has his name on the land 😢 he is a member of WEF 😢
I believe in earning your stay on this earth . Having said that I do not support royal status that infringe in individual opportunities may it be by taxing its peasants and supporting their titles in any ways .
My grandson is applying to join the British army. Being ex military myself I have tried to dissuade him but to no avail. The notion one is fighting for King and country is a lie. In reality you risk your life for large corporations and wealthy elitists.
And they call those on benefits parasites. The fuckin' government even sanction people on UC if they miss an appointment. Fuck em' all!
Ahhh these nazis even changed their name to windsor.  He is an inspid philanderer, they killed his ex wife... shades of Henry VIII.  Without the monarchy England would still have tourism.  Cant understand why Scotland has not srparated.  Whilst I have empathy for Harry, his book demonstrates how out of touch they are with reality and hardship
Do you have any idea on how we can d this? Had about enough of it all at this point
People like Glen should be prime minister.? He's intelligent, clearly well read and has a real sense of moral justice too. 👏🫡👍🏼
Say what you really think!
Not all white people are evil. this man spirit is godly just like George Galloway.  he gives hope to the European race. get rid of these evil families of the past who still  dictate majority of the worlds future..
There a sign of genocidal wealth and creating system which force peasants to work for shelter and food. they got to the position of power through the sword. european imperlism got taught by the evil romans.  The averand there followers do not have spirits. age European has a good spirit i dont believe imperialism
The French do not look cool 😂
Well said;  Public needs to wake up to unexplained "Sunday" events that have happened in 2024.   Too much of a "coincidence".  Not to be trusted
Charles is a signed up member of the World Economic Forum .an organisation dedicated to putting British people into slavery and allowing the people to own Nothing not a house,car,bank account. To be totally dependant on the’Masters’ whims. Charles is NOT someone that should have any power or authority over British people.  GET RID OF HIM AND HIS MONARCHY.
Chuck sucks!!
2:07 I like that you made the connection between king and businesses, because we are told here in US that Americans left England to get away from rule of monarchy and taxation without representation but here we are with businesses and politicians taking the place of royalty—no difference.
Theÿ are not Windsor,  the real family name is Saxa Coburg Gotha.   German.    Windsor name was adopted to keep the public happy
Why would you suck up to people who have the best of everything and have no idea of the drudgery ordinary people endure....We got to be a simple race of people...dim-witted people

He's the anti christ people
To many pedos and weirdos inside and connected to the royals
This guy talks like a commie .  If you don't like the UK , go to Russia comrade !
The Queen had the good sense to not let us peasants know what her personal opinions actually were. That outward appearance of neutrality helped rebrand the monarchy for seven more decades as a unifying and steadying force.  King Charles has told us his opinions and are lot of them are troubling, generally involving using climate alarmism as an excuse to gradually crush the living standards of ordinary people. He’s also allied himself very publicly with very deeply concerning organisations like the WEF.  I did think that a lot of people were holding fire on their republicanism sentiment until the Queen died and that it would be unleashed on King Chuck. It hasn’t really happened and I have to say that I am surprised.
Biggest crime sydicate.
There was an episode of 60 minutes that showed these 'things' are not the real royals The real ones don't want anything to do with England and the pretentious lives the royals lead. Apparently they live somewhere in North Qld here in Australia
The only job he ever had before becomjng king was waiting for his mum to die.
They all look like Trump Supporters.  If you think Will and Kate will be any better your in for a rude awakening.
We no longer need royal family    they not  doing anything  for the UK   they don't care about the UK  public people they only care about them selves
You are so correct, they have Palaces full of ill gotten goods they should all be changed jailed, chrilden put in foster care ,and if 5hey get out of jail pu5 in a council flat and like the Japanese king retraining to live like common folk , due to there inbreeding they should be fixed for the good of man kind even the chrilden
I am a shoplifter here in Australia. I 100 % a gree is it stealing to feed families if you take it from real thieves ? Of course the answer is ….hell no.
King Charles is particularly wicked , His so much like the Uniform and he can not go to War , imagine how this man treated  the only member of the monarchy who was brave to go to War Prince Harry , King charle did not allowed him to put on his uniform but give uniform to those that did not go to War , We never saw the Queen put on Soldier uniform .      The way King Charles is treating Prince Harry is eye sore just because he wanted to please Prince Williams the  lazy one who had been brain watch as the Heir to Throne , abd Camilla his wife .this Williams refused to do any work but enjoyed drinking and insulting his brother who served in the military . If the military can put an end to those insult will be better .only the Soldier will be allowed to be wearing uniform .
Im Scottish and the royal family has always been considered an English thing.  On the whole we have no interest whatsoever in them.  If I did think about it it is a feeling of disgust.
Bro, you are talking to people that beg to be subjugated but think others are worse off.
Ex squaddie 10 years my allegiance to the Royal family died when the Queen died.
They are just a load of corrupt freeloaders 😡
£100m to put a hat on that imbecile and his bird, how did he get the right to just do that, make her a queen. They should have paid for it themselves - ridiculous - do one ffs
No one like him
Needs to be more people with honest and caring truthful❤ Thanks for sharing!👍 people are already seeing some of what is happening in todays world with that family… unreal.     Prayers will bring the light … truth will surface… our lord sees all … knows all. Our world needs a lot of prayer and love!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Even Charle's father called him a whimp!
Hes not wrong, but the royal family is just one of many serpent lizards who rule over us... The Emerald tablets are no joke...
You are spot on
Does anyone realise that you can no longer find 'God Save The Queen' by The Sex Pistols on any Jukebox anymore in Britain. It has been banned.
The royal family dose not own Australia, the first nations people, Aboriginal people of Australia had thier lands, culture, identity ,men ,women,stolen children just ripped away from their  mothers arms, children  , all other indiginous peoples misplaced because of the greed of the royal families, charlie and his bulldog mistress nothing to do with aboriginal people they murder thier own for god sake
Royal families represent the ugly face of colonial era
I think people forget that Charlie was very close to Jimmy S, it’s well documented. If you want to succeed in life as a high end gangster, become a politician.. or if your really lucky you may be in the Royal Family circuit
Would you sooner have a putin 🤔
What they should be doing is making restitution to those they have wronged previously.
Horrible Bosses?
Go figure
More people visit Abraham Lincoln s tomb each year than buck palace   and Abe hasn't been on the payroll since 1865
Down through the ages, the British monarchy has been paved with blood, murder and adultery. What's new? Ever true:  "The love of money is the root of all evil."
Oh thank you for being so honest.❤
French are cool 😂😂😂😂
Love his latest devil king portrait.
After Olligarchs have plunged the world - they go after there own people.
Why should the Duke of Westminster own most of London & bring in millions for one family?
in this age, the concept of a ruling class or a political system has become obsolete, if someone like Elon Musk would launch an app , that replaces politicians, and gives the power to vote on policy to the people, true a blockchain voting system, that is set up to track fraud, and delivers complete transparency. There is one small price to pay, and that is to give up the privacy of the vote, the first law voted in should be that the people have the right to oppose all existing laws, without legal consequences, and that any form of intimidation or political assembly is outlawed, the votes on policy should be individual, free of legal consequence, but not private,
Only one true King.  Britain is a disgrace.....who is the"king!!!!", a man that got his wife bumped off. Horrendous.
I never liked the royals but people are blind!
There will never be real change as long as the Royal family continue, they are the figurehead of established  privilege.
There are 42 countries that have a monarchy. They are countries with a stable economy, they create diplomatic and economic relations, they help collect donations and funds to help less developed areas. You who have "impressions" are the supporters of politicians destroying countries. You should be proud to be under such an Emblem.
If you don't know anything about him, how dare you judge? you expose "impressions" of what humanity looks like now. Too bad you have the right to vote.
Sometimes you would think how the so called well educated intelligent British people can so stupidly not rebel and get rid of this ridiculous leech of an institution
Let Them Eat Cake!!!! Still true
The Windsors( Koburgh Saxe family) loved jimmy saville 😮
Let God reign if you want freedom, truth, and order.
Are you saying the royal family are the biggest welfare recipients in all of the UK?
When a family member of such a family breaks away and gets condemned, you wonder how we function 😢
Pure envy
Love this!
And they blame eSwatini 🇸🇿!
Sounds like you've eaten some sour grapes buddy. Deal with it and grow a pair.😊
The royals don't bring in money. London brings in tourists rgeardless if the royals are there or not. And they'd still come to see the sinister city whether they were there or not. INterestingly enough, the Verailles brings in more cash than Buck Palace. If you're familiar with what happened to its previous occupants, m aybe there's something to be learned here.
Princes trust had placements with charles for butler training. sexual assault cases on young boys caused that to be squashed and now its all hush hush. German romanion pedo royals is wat we have. Philip brought in heroine into scotland using the navy. Another hushed story.
Too right. And don’t forget, we poor peasants in Australia still have King Charles as our Sovereign! It’s ludicrous! 2024 already, enough! Why is Australia not a Republic? This current 20-year Paradigm, which began March 23 2023, will be the end of monarchies, and the two-party system. Politics will need to shift to Independent leaders who are qualified, for a start, and who are willing to work hard for the common good. It will happen between now and 2043. Big changes ahead!
Unm too late for Charles to change    jobs he'll have to retire 😂
MSM won't allow such artists to even get to the stage now. They're all sheep who aren't allowed to show personality.
Do not think that Allah ignores the deeds of the sinners. He only gives them reprieve until a day when eyes will stare [in horror].
Calling the the people of England commoners is so rude
The people of England  is England.  From America
Have a look at, Tim Cohen (The antichrist and a cup of tea).
I think this PRIVATE in the army exposes himself not the King ! He cannot even make Sgt .    But the click bait will get its own support from those in the echo chamber who have already made their minds up.... as for me.... 'God Save the King! "   What a boring moan..... the royals are gansgters and  inbred morons and what a lot of hatred. Anyone would think he was jealous as a mere private in the army.. I think he exposes himself not the King.
The absolute KEY to the 'royals' and how they behave is the personality disorder Narcissism.
Very interesting.
It's his majesty's government, and, his majesty's opposition. So who is running this country, really?
As a Texan with Irish and Welsh ancestry, I have never understood Americans who are into following the English Monarchy. I know my Irish family on my mother’s side were starved out of Ireland. The Welsh on my dad’s side had it better. They were given land grants in South Carolina for leaving.
I appreciate you a lot man, you perfectly pointed out how the uselessness of the British monarchy is supported only by a large group of ignorant people who have always been kept in ignorance and poverty, not by those who have truly fought and realized what it means to be discriminated , used, and humiliated in name of the King or Queen. Congratulations.
Thank God for your talk,
Government is all the problems in the world. Why do we keep supporting them?
Powerful. Thank you!
1:49 “…continuity of inequality.” Wow.
I have never liked King Charles at all! His treatment of Diana was wrong from the start!  Diana said there was three in the marriage with Camilla! He wanted his cake and eat it! Also King Charles is in the WEF/DAVOS Globalists! He has been pampered his whole life by servants and staff in his thirteen residences! I do like Prince William and Catherine though! Maybe it is time for a public discussion about the Monarchy now!
Totally agree. They’re a waste of time, besides incredibly boring. 😂
He's half German n half Greek illuminati
Down with the British monarchy
My entire family has disowned me for these views.
These people are the illuminati headed by Roth child's and Bill gates. The saud regime included. Epstein was killed as he was going to spill the beans on these child abusers. They will get their punishment  in the next life
Are you a communist?
Dear American Patriots 6/5/24      After many years of coordinating the public reading of our Nation’s Declaration Of Independence from tyrannical rule on Independence Day in Payson Arizona’s Green Valley Park, I finally leave that role to someone else. Lew Levenson, Bill Sahno, Don and Peri Cline, the homeschooled Marsh siblings who recited from memory the DOI publicly as children, Gary Bedsworth and many others began the annual readings of our Nation’s “birth certificate” on its birthday some 19 years ago.     I typically donated and operated the sound system for the occasion and was eventually asked to take over its annual coordination. That meant enlisting speakers to read 1. The historical context of the Revolutionary war - available online, 2. The actual reading of the DOI - stressing the right and duty of a people to create or alter their government as best suits them, 3. What happened to the 56 Signers (Our nation’s first veterans IMO) once again, available online. 4. Including a Nation Under God theme - as exemplified by the fourth stanza of our 1934 US Congress-approved four verse National Anthem.     Music from a CD of children singing patriotic songs, live electric guitar screaming the anthem in Jimi Hendrix style, live female soloing the fourth verse after the audience singing of the first National Anthem verse, trombone sonorously playing the melody one more time as attendees contemplate our nation’s future and their place in it, audience comments - have all been components at one time or another.    We typically did not seek town sponsorship with its requirement for event insurance coverage or political office-seekers desiring public exposure for the event. It was meant to be a sovereign citizen commemoration without donations, political endorsements or pressures from anything but the universal desire and Creator-endowed right to be free. Perhaps somewhat radical from other average events by today’s standards.    Hopefully other free persons will energize themselves to hold such Public Readings in their churches, lodges, clubs, taverns, parking lots (shaded, hopefully), parks, event centers and backyards in the future. For therein lies the needed indoctrinating requirement for stiffening patriotic spines everywhere. Therein lie all the reasons for fireworks displays and patriotic music.     Without the Declaration Of Independence as the core of American culture and it’s representative government, it can never hope or claim to be the “greatest nation of the world” or even provide a glimmer of hope for any global community suffering under the tyranny of despotism anywhere.    Our Declaration Of Independence is the vaccination against all tyranny. Take it, or succumb. Thomas Jefferson said, “When tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes duty.” And I say, “Tyranny strives to own every party, group or institution.”    Become your own private citizen coordinator for such a tyranny-shedding event.    By the way, I challenge you to tally all of the places that publicly read the DOI in this country today. I wager you will feel shame once you try. You’ve got shoulders. Carry on the tradition of reading the Founding Document publicly. Or history will have but a vague memory of a people who once cherished freedom.    If any wish to contact me for tips or behind-the-scenes assistance, I am at Bruceowales@gmail.com.
Preach brother, couldn’t have said it better myself. Wake up Britain!!!
Bitter and twisted.
Down with the monarchy
Don’t idolise this family. They come from a long line of seriously violent often nasty individuals.
Charles is not loyal to this country he is NOT MY KING
All humans fight for money, land and precious metals. They have done for 1000s of years, not just our Royal family. They don't ask to be reincarnated into Royal families. Charles & Anne have done as much as they can to try and do good & save the planet. There are many more evil people out there. The Gov. /politicians and banking industry are worse. I have personal examples!! I'm being blocked by today because I wanted to know the assoc.between theBanks,FCA,&SAGA Insurance,or Not!! 😩
I suppose this clown thinks it would be better to have someone like Donald Trump or Joe Biden as head of state. Or even Joe Stalin?
It’s kind of strange that parents can influence their kids on what to like and not like, my Dad hates the Royals, he called me a sheep and an arse kisser when I joined the military. Fact is the whole allegiance thing was just another hurdle to get the job I wanted and I never really thought anymore about this allegiance bollocks. My parents didn’t influence my dislike for the royals it was time that taught me that the royals are nothing but scum and tyrants who have bullied their way through society to line their own pockets. They live in some archaic world where they believe they are better than everyone else, they are no better than the person who cooks the fries in McDonalds in fact they are worse, they wouldn’t know a hard days work if it but them in the arse. Fuck the royals 🖕🏻
Absolutely
Yet democracy per se doesn't seem to be working either. A system I can imagine might actually meet a certain complex balance of powers and interests is a constitutional republic, but wherein elections aren't held every four years but every ten.
😂
STOP THE BULLSHIT !!!
I'm retired British army. Its funny how many times I seen soldiers put soldiers from other  countries in their place for talking about the Queen yet not ome I served with will support Charles
Britain has Stockholm Syndrome when it comes to the Royal Family...
Good stuff
All starts with your national anthem it's all about one man
Acidic truth. Oligarchy is the reality on British soil; ditto every polity, leaving the masses of nations in the fetters of double-thinking and pseudo intellectualism and underdevelopment.
America spilled precious blood and treasure getting rid of those royal leeches.
DUDE!  YOU ROCK! In Britain, you are a subject,  In America you would be a citizen.  There is a vast difference.
THE KING 🤴 IS THE MAIN MAN AT THE  WEF HIS IDEA GREAT RESET. DE POPULATIONS.
The Rothschild run it so unless you sort out the banks if won’t make a difference it  could get worse
It is so nice and sounds so good to hear the f......... truth about the monarchy.
Your monarchs are done. There are a bunch of pedophiles.
How do you square this with the invasion of Ireland,
I soo agree  they are dark   they say C and H wont rule long😮  myself and many worry for Kate The firm give false info out yo us..wre not fools😮
Finally, I agree with someone in Britain. The monarchy are the most evil institution in the World. They are the world's biggest mop!
I'm English, and not a Royalist! I just laugh to myself when I see and hear the peasants bowing and scraping to that  robbing greedy family. What goes on in their heads that they feel the need to belittle themselves, by worshipping this outdated bunch of rich grifters.
Very interesting video😎
Well alot of christians think hes the antichrist and after that whole fiasco at the olympics where they brought that bull out and that girl was dancing and charles was there giving some type of speech they might not be wrong. Read your bible then look at his coat of arms.
We don't mock them anymore because of new laws brought in by sCameron. So it's actually illegal. They hated Spitting Image that much.
100% correct
Lol from the usa
1688 Glorious Revolution CESTUI Que Act 1666 Slaves from Birth
"A bunch of peasants sucking up to this family of inbred morons"  I lolled. Thanks!
I agree my father said 60 years ago that the royal family are a family of parasites, they are even worse these days ,visitors would still go to see Buckingham Castle even with no royal family and yes what a pity Britain have a French revolution to get rid of all these pompous arseholes
Fight for all people.  Stop the elitist agenda
Resentful hard done by communist socialist anti authoritarian teenage rebellion. What makes you such an expert? You're just a moaning smart arse ex soldier.
International Arms dealers ????
100 million pounds or $193,442,171:00 Australian dollars or $127,244,500:00 United states dollars, for his coronation. Ridiculous.
I feel the same way about ,let the young run America
Annoying background noise
'Chubby fingers' took me out 😂😅
❤
He's got a chip on his shoulder for sure. As a British soldier he is a traior!!
Caracter produced under dictature-decoded out,looking for the surce of this hatefull projection!!!punch in back of surviving europeans...
They are not even  British. They are German decent if I'm not mistaken .
British Royalty, in the words of Pres. Biden, are dog-faced pony soldiers.
Keep up the disclosures. Many of us in America don't know the inner workings or secrets of royalty in Britain. I've always thought it was dumb.
There is no reasonable argument to build a foundation of logic for the concept of royalty.
I have said years ago , time to get rid of the monarchy and career politicians and to hold the elites accountable for their actions and crimes. The age old problem of civilisations since the beginning, the system continues of controlling the people
Beautifully explained. They are utterly useless to anyone but themselves.
Every Republic, starting out promising everyone equality and wealth spread to all, have become dictatorships now and we see how that has ended. Nothing about equality there. Zimbabwe, China, Russia and many other countries. Have you seen the palace and underground bunker to protect Putin and his family from nuclear war? Very much showing some are more equal than others, depending on your importance. China would have done the same. You will have no freedom of speech, in fact talking as you are now would get you killed. All you are worried about is what you think you are missing out on and what you think you deserve. You have a dictator mentality quite obviously. We would not be better off under your idea of equality.
A GROWN MAN CALLING HIS MOTHER MAMMY 😅😅😅😅
Well said man 👨
Your talking about civil servants getting a raise we’ll they’re money is guaranteed in the bank and on time imagine being self employed who built Britain and get fk all credit.have a day off son you was hanging about your barracks more than being in a war
Joe. Hope many more of our petty king watch this podcast over and over again. A real and honest view of exactly who these lazy lizards are. 😂Thanks Joe!!!
I’ve just observed our good King Charles wipe his nose on his white gloved hands. Ugh! Disgusting. What a fine example😂
he is of German decent.
Interesting
Pourquoi au lieu d ecrire ce vous pensez vous le dites pas dans une interview
The French "revolution" was financed by 7 or 8 international Jewish bankers. One of the first acts of that "revolution" was to put a naked prostitute on the altar of Notre-Dame.
Brilliantly spoken!
It is quite dreary that our nation still revere this family.
Never been for the Royal family, I've seen them as a strain on the economy and progression to a more free and fair society. Time to abolish the Monarchy, but what then do you replace it with? President or what?
Fair play to you my old enemy,.   Love your channel.
Get rid of the spoilt brats!
Welfare state for landed gentry
The trouble is mate, revolutions don't work! English, French or Russian weren't succesful,🤺🧐
England is no longer a kingdom the royal family are thieves and robbers I absolutely  I approve this message brother  fake Charles need to get a job just  like every body else and paid tax as well and then distributed all the wealth for the poor...
They already know spirit is not Greater when they have the spirit of the 🌎
I’m a 64 year old female American and I’m glad to see that some of you are not hypnotized by this charade of entitled, greedy, self serving family. I’m honestly amazed and surprised that they rein was not toppled and dissolved by the British people by now. They serve absolutely no useful purpose, and no benefit to the people whatsoever. The money they receive and the assets they own combined, could indefinitely feed, and clothe an entire nation!! How on earth is this fair? From what I understand some of them are downright belittling and mean to the army of people that wait on them, hand and foot. Downright disgusting!
Thank you for this , well said . Jesus is the king ,not him .
aww be silent now an taker ur beating
The Chemical, Pharmaceutical, and Medical Industries have devised the perfect business model. Make a King's ransom vaxxinating everyone from birth, and then totally clean up treating the myriad of diseases caused by vaxxinations throughout a patient's lifetime. Bloody brilliant!
My father RIP, was a WW2 veteran. He would roll in his grave hearing your bullshit. If this is all you see in the monarchy  go and live in Communist China or the Middle East…Tosser
You are nothing other than a traitor to the fine nation England was once known as.
What a circus ,they are nothing but Royal crooks
Its royal something.....
So true what you are saying ! It’s also sad true! What’s wrong with people that they can’t see it ?
you are amazing !!!!
love it
So true!! Finally
They are useless , their is nothing noble about them .they were no different from anybody else .down through the centuaries they fought in wars to claim a crown .their was nothing royal about any of them .waste of space .
God is my King...❤
😯 wow
I can't stand how the media keeps telling us how William & Catherine can do no wrong and how Harry & Meghan can do no right. I have not seen even ONE nice article on Meghan, which leads me to wonder why they are playing up the HERO / VILLAIN storyline......almost like watching wrestling or US politics. This is such a DISTRACTION from what is really going on around us. DON'T BE DISTRACTED.
👏🇵🇱🇨🇦
Kings and queens are stupid anyway. This isn’t the medieval days. Royal families is ridiculous
aha,,,,,yore jelous…simple as that
NO royals!!!
Absolutely evil folks!!
My thoughts exactly...I've been thinking and saying this for 20 years.. BRAVO
America never talks about their revolution is because They Lost, The Crown won that WAR, America is an Annex of England VIA the Unacknolage Deep State Shadow Government Government,  operated by the Owners of the Planet Earth,  the Rothschild / Rockefeller Cooperation Alliance, Alledgedy?
Yep!! One big circus!
Well said
How did they become Royals???????
I SALUTE U YOUNG MAN!!.....THANK U
The Royal Family is just a continuous trajectory of the likes of King Henry with the poor living a slightly better life!
I am very much for an actual Christian monarchy but those rothchilds’ slaves are no royalty!  Those are the worst of humanity. There’s not even one actual free visible head of any western nation; they’re all slaves of the banksters!
I see there are a lot of anti British on here you don't like it then leave.
The fact that the British people adore this family says everything you need to know about them. Weak minded
You swore allegiance to the crown and country didn't  they pay you enough.
A bunch of CANTS?
This is all hog wash I served Queen and country for 39 years and was proud and honoured to do so. The UK will still be lead by  a royal family in one hundred years time .
Totally agree. I’m feed up that they are living off our money.

PIG CHARLES III
As an American of English and Irish decent, I think the concept of monarchy is archaic. It has had its time, but it now needs to be dissolved.
Stolen Valor or 10% off at the Pancake House.for Veterans
Us Irish on the island of Ireland know already but fair play for being honest
City of London😂😂😂
Love this man.
Listening to you is like hearing my words coming from a different mouth. I am no myopic pro-monarcist with my head buried in some Palace-dependent magazine serving their verbal 'durian' and calling it exotic. I love Britain, even tho Im an Aussie.  Personally I consider holding the Windsors up as the principled doyens and role-models of Western civilisation, is simply insulting. They trade in scandals by the thousand, with a history of stolen land, stolen assets, destroying civiluzations, like the Zulu, and in their wake, they force young men die in battle, while they laugh about the losses over happy hour. They are WEAK in personal character and integrity. Their hypocrisy they sport, like the meaningless medals draping their toy soldier kit, and as a family, theyre overpaid, overindulged, and fortunately fir Australua, over there in England. Charles struts around like Europe's version of Ronald McDonald and well the rest are all equally dubious and equally worthless, to me. Does anyone really look at Harry or Andrew and feel respect?  Mate, youre not Robinson Crusoe!!! You say God save the king. I say bah-humbug!!!
The West needs the real return of the king. Only us can be us
Fritz Springmeier
The "King" WILL FALL.
Long live the King.
The Royals see everyone as their servants to do their bidding.
If you are so unhappy, go somewhere else and see if its any better.
Reminds me of when biden recently said  God save.the queen
When a squaddie it was just being employment not deployment. I was reprobate mind since I was dead in my trespasses and sins. Robert Harris wrote about those 58 who signed Charles I beheading remember he's writing well researched historical fiction.
Sue Townsend Adrian Mole also wrote about Royal Family in council house.
😂😂😂
What was exposed?
King has no power brother , the power is with the black Prince , but it's not his Power , the power is the Dragon , and always has been , but it seems time is about to catch up with them all .... Dragon included ....  No Man  & not never , not once , Not Happening ...... Ahayah Yashaya !!!
I came because of the portrait, wtf!!
Own half the damm worlds land mass.
Kings be dammmed .monarchy has no place in the modern world.
Love this guy…….
But we MUST be aware of the one who is to replace the monarchy...
That’s why precious Diana didn’t fit in. She was used.
Trouble is the upper classes realised big money in Acting ,Performing on stage Television so it took over ,not talented part of the stinky rich upper class so called society.

I don't know why the British people think these people are useful to britain, no wait, I know why. Their comprehensive staff of PR staff. They all need jobs imo.
The only band to get kicked out of their own country for a song 😊hard core good stuff 😊
ok. You had your say  mate  now jog On .
Very interesting.....
Really I've seen a video of the Lord Rothschild pointing his finger into at the time prince Charles's chest, who run what.
I'm English but live in Australia for the last 57 yrs, I agree the monarchy needs to go now, look at king poof Charles he's leading the nwo, what a prick, I want the lot of them gone and all their wealth returned to the people of Britain.
Are the Royal Family aliens ? Probably .
I’m so glad there are some Brits saying it.
I agree with Kev.IN Bridges, we should all take it in turns to be King or Queen of England.
Oh, yeah.. King Charley earned all those medals on his chest in trenches on the front line! Only a fool would be proud of these blood sucking royals. One good thing I credit the French, and later the bolshevics, they dealt better with their royals!
Blood of the Middle East all over Kink Charles.
Windsor mafia!!!! Give back what you have stolen!!!
Chucky is noreal king. Accident of birth. Cheater royale.
ROYAL SCUM!
If Charles wasn't such a committed globalist there'd be more of an argument for keeping the Saxe-Coburg and Gotha cult going. But given that he's shown almost zero concern for British culture and British values he deserves to go the way of his German monarch ancestors.
he looks real ishishh
Evil will be judged by the Almighty!! In all history no adulterer could take the throne. The priest who allowed his adultery and his divorce is just as evil and sinning. It’s all going to be judged by the only true King! Not one human on earth is any better than any other we are all sinners imperfect. Only the meek and humble who accept God Almighty will live through the Great Tribulation we are coming into.
Gid said about a year or 2 ago that Charles will not keep the crown , they will find out something about the qeen , hell be exposed 🙏❤️
Congrats for this guy speaking out.
Well it’s a veiw ….. everybody needs somebody to hate 😂. The royal family leave me alone and don’t interfere in my everyday life unlike effin lefties who want to take all my money that I worked hard for and spend it on things they want to spend it on. Once you are done with the royal family you’ll then want to dispense with all the business owners and when you’ve done with all of them you’ll end up fighting amongst yourselves until there is nothing left. The comments on here sound like a gathering of the disaffected. I’d rather a benign royal family than a bunch of effin useless lefties any day.
I found out the other day that even if you freely own the land, any gold or silver found in that land is owned by the royals. WTF!  Who the hell  do they think they are.
Down with the Windsor mafia!
While Charles is no king, I'm willing to admit he's a tyrant. But it IS a king that protects the commoners from the politicians. -Franz Joseph of Austria

This guy has awaken to realise he was tricked into going n kill others to keep these crooked charlatans criminals rich 😂😂😂.  Never too late mate.
As an iranian. Becareful what you wish for.
Yes, our British history is amazing, like the fact how the Welsh are not part of the British flag but no one talks about that yet what's ironic you no longer want a monarch, wow, that is so bloody rich!
Joanna Lumley for President. Who will naysay me ?
So then who's chubby little fingers do you suggest, you would like to replace him with I oneder.
I think he's the antichrist 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Monsrchy adultery  royal  evil  cruel to the son bad lion king.
This so-called king killed Dianna for an old hag😂😂😂😂😂😂
This guy has got it on the button, knows his stuff 🇮🇪
You just did advocate the French model
You are a 100 right about these royal relic leaches
There is only one king His name is King Jesus
He doesn't have long to rule.  His time is short compared to his mother.  He named Crullia queen; he deserves his troubles.
The only person who got hands dirty was the late queen Elizabeth  as she was a mechanic  in the war years  the rest are nowt but beggers  get rid of the so called  royal famil6 lazy B.. ...ds
You are very RIGHT!  Away with the monarchy!  Princess Charles is not really respected, they amass so much wealth while the rest of the public goes hungry.  The deluded lower class are the first to hail them, they’ve been conditioned from time memorial to hail the monarchy as it makes their  lives more colourful and richer.  It’s the biggest propaganda ever.  A whole nation marching to their death, while the greedy royals fill their coffers.

God Save the Land of Hope and Glory
What a clownworld. Royals with blueblood a gang of thieves. Goverment officials a pack of powerhungry bloodthirsty wolves. Newsagencies a tool of opression and indoctrination. Police a means to force inhumane and evil agendas on the plebs. Military a way to get rid of any alpha male that could end up as a threat to the controllers. What a clownworld indeed.
All his metals and no rime in war
Its got to go
I bow to one King only, Jesus Christ.
Who are you and why are you a disgrace? I recognise the footage of you when you were younger and said you are the nations disgrace.
it's 2024 and people still believe in the concept of king and queen???? it's laughable!! don't worship humans!!  May Allah guide you all..may Allah guide all of us..
Well spoken, mate!!

They hide their surname because its German
Wef puppet, disgraceful
While I subscribe to the theory that there is an unaccountable elite running this world, ironically, if you study the figures, our monarchy is cheaper to run per capita than the French or American presidencies. You can check the numbers up for yourself. There's plenty of ranting and railing in your video but where are the numbers? The French I know complain that they get no bang for their bucks: loadsa money, no pomp. Cromwell was an incredible hypocrite who shifted all the works of art into his private residence. The workers were even banned from celebrating Mayday. No thanks. If you wanted to make things fairer you'd have to roll everything back to the injustice of the Norman Conquest.  Could you honestly imagine how awful it would be if we had Tony Blair or Nadine Dories as head of state? Have you really thought it through?
When he cheated on Diana the public was assured Camilla would not be queen but everyone seems to have forgotten that
So many scandals. The Queens sisters in law were all married to top ranking Nazi officials. King Edward 8th met and admired Hitler greatly ...even wanted to rule the UK again with a Nazi peace deal . Princess Margaret wasted her life in Alcohol and cigarettes in the Caribbean . Queen Mother spent way too much and was always in debt ......this family just rules by a chance of birth not because of ability . Up until very recently they all married cousins as any body below their  social standing was considered inferior .
Thank you for speaking up and showing their true colours!
I've to stay out of the realms what can I say I'm bravo Juliett j9f experimentation of astrophysics computing quantum and the art's 1960s and sick of murder attempts and electronic harassment targeting via the computer systems in the system itself It's hell and I'm frightened because it's my fucking fucked up birthday so thanks klous I'm brimming believe me sxx bravo Juliett
I agree 100 per cent with Joe
Do you think things are better in China, Russia, the USA, India? If it's privilege you despise then you will find it in every country across the globe, the only difference being their rich and privileged are mainly political leaders. Personally I have nothing against the royal family, but your personalised attacks and rudeness diminish your argument, and you. If the monarchy was worth a billion and you decided to split the proceeds between the population, we'd all end up with less than 20 quid in our pockets. Is that a life-changer for you? 20 quid? The inequality in Britain is the result of taxation policies, employment law and social policy. It is the result of political will by successive governments. Focus on politics. THAT is where the real power lies, not in a constitutional head of state that has more to do with historical tradition than anything else.
A somewhat good idea to get rid of the monarchy. As an American I sometimes like to watch the British monarchy but as that guy said is true about their status. English would be kind of boring without the monarchy. In the end he did not impress enough about the people’s ability to free speech as we say 2nd amendment. Losing the monarchy is a really tuff thing to decide on.
He murdered Diana.
Sour grapes here.
I'm a republican, though I hold some romanticism towards the Royals. However you hit the nail on the head regarding the  Royals being a crime family!
This fellow is so wrong, our monarchs stop crooks and self serving politicians like Bliar becoming our Head of State.
Get rid waste of space and money
I recommend you increase your medication
German past huh say nothing more
You can not even get your facts right..they pay tax… you swore an oath to the queen ..you are a hypocrit and fame seeker
Tell your own story as well…DESERTER
When one looks through this channel, there's a lot of things that'd make you think of the feminist BLM Socialist types. What is the actual stance or ideology of this soldier besides the royal family? Labour supporter that chants "from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"? Or something else?
Surely as a British soldier you worked for them?
Hahahaha the king and Queen
...the royals shouldn't be head of anything, they act like thugs..
They changed their name from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (German) to Windsor due to the First World War (distancing themselves from their German heritage)
The job of the Army  is to be without prejudices  and stand and defend the Crown and Country that they are called to  serve..
What a knob. Poorly informed.
Isn't the real King a Hamilton , not a Tudor ???
THE ☠️ OF THE WORLD 🌎
England has needed to get rid of the royal family for a long time. They are evil like all elites
Windsors are not British!!!
BRITISH NEVER SPEAK OF THEIR REVOLUTION BECAUSE IT DID NOT SUCCEED. THE KING CAME BACK AND BUSINESS AS USUAL CONTINUED. SO THE BASTARDS ARE STILL THERE AND THE PEOPLE IS STILL IN A KIND OF SLAVERY.
Since they say the royals bring in money why can't they be cut off tax payers money while they maintain their lavish lifestyles with the money they are believed to bring in😂😂😂😂😂😂. Fraudsters!!!!!!!
Thank you for this.
Britain wake up
You are talking  you are talking  I never was a fan and never will
Funny how all of earth's nations are in shake-ups and suddenly being 'exposed' ... when that would bring swift attention, in the not distant past - because ALL info is con tr0lled.  Interesting, indeed.  [Uh oh]
I'm appalled at how much various crowns are worth......I would be ashamed to wear them.   They could be sold and the monies put into a Treasury for the needs of the people.
This is so sad, it amazes how expensive the crowns are, how many are really necessary.  I would be ashamed to have them on my  head when they could be sold and put into a Treasury for the various needs of people.
You are very sad!!!
So true unfortunately...
Amen! ✊
He is 100 percent correct
We really don't need this family
You are right,they are very rich with money invested in many over seas projects which we won't  talk about here   and have they been a good  example to look up to ,just look at History  Yes keep the Royals for show but not for ruling power
He's not a gangster he's useless
It appears that many kings during the time of Napoleon and up until the end of the British East India Company era were corrupt figures who usurped their thrones, betraying the native populations of their respective countries. These governments sold out their own power to foreign monarchs. Sweden serves as a prime example of this type of corruption and national theft.   The French funny little frog, aligned with Napoleon, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte held the title of Marshal of France (in French, Maréchal de France) under Napoleon. He was by bribery, threat of war, and corruption made both Prince of Pontecorvo by Napoleon in 1806 before being elected as the Crown Prince of Sweden in 1810.  The French frogs effectively usurped the Swedish throne, just as they also stole the island in the West Indies that belonged to Sweden that was called Saint Barthélemy (often referred to as St. Barths or St. Barts). The period during which Sweden controlled the island was from 1784 to 1878. This period is often referred to as the Swedish Colonial Era of Saint Barthélemy.. The French used corruption and juridical laws to steal it from Sweden as the funny little French frogs done with most goods and land in their whole history!  Today, there is a substantial collection of documents proving that the French stole the monarchy of Sweden and that it was through corruption, threats of war, and bribes that the French managed to seize control of Sweden from the legitimate Swedish candidates for the throne.   Upon studying this issue, I utilised ChatGPT to inquire whether modern laws could be invoked to depose the French Bernadotte family from the Swedish monarchy. Remarkably, ChatGPT identified relevant laws that could be employed in a legal trial against the Bernadotte family. Furthermore, it highlighted legislation that obligates sitting Swedish ministers to act upon such evidence. Therefore, if an attorney were to compile and present this evidence, it could legally compel the Swedish government to depose the Bernadotte monarchy.  there is nothing worse than French frogs, no wonder that we made a full song and dance about the funny little frogs back in the day, that today is the main song we sing with children during Midsummer in Sweden while jumping around in potato bags competing which person can make it to the end without falling unconsciously mocking the funny little frogs as the song sings,   "The little frogs, the little frogs Are funny to look at. The little frogs, the little frogs Are funny to look at.  No ears, no ears No tails do they have. No ears, no ears No tails do they have.  Quack-quack-quack, quack-quack-quack, Quack-quack-quack-quack-aa. Quack-quack-quack, quack-quack-quack, Quack-quack-quack-quack-aa."  People today have no idea this song was made by Swedish soldiers fighting the French back in the day and sang while drunk making fun of killing and cutting up the despicable corrupt French as sho le aristocrats!   But for us with a background in the Swedish military we know all too well about the past history of war in Sweden and how we fought well, but due to greed in our government we lost the whole country and monarchy to a ill-willed French prick and now his descendants of the Bernadotte famnily is nothing more than an old drunk fart that been sleeping with prostitutes his whole life and spend 127 milion for private enjoyment per year of Swedish tax money and traveling around with his Brazilian mixed wife who is a direct descendant of a high ranked nazi faily who fled to Brazil back in the day, and now live a luxery life in Sweden on the Swedes hard earned tax money by the consequence of how the French lured and bribed Swedish governmental people to steal the monarchy of Sweden!...   Once one sits down and studies monarchies around Europe we all see is nothing but greedy, corrupt men whole stole, tricked and bribed their ways to the thrones of Europe today!   Understand that the tax for entrepreneurs in Sweden, one man/woman companies are 67% of all you make! Do you really think we want to give this away to WOKE universities, a corrupt and useless healthcare system, and a monarchy that stole the whole nation and lives off OUR money now in glory with 7 castles to play around in!  To he ll with the Bernadotte, let the castle ones again burn to the ground, I say!
Can you imagine how the masses will turn on the monarchy if the rumours about Catherine and the children are true. 👀

Well said!
IT'S ALL ABOUT PURE INTENTION AND TRUTH

Freemasonry and the central banks.
U have been cheated.or u feel like u been cheat.now u came out expressing ur feeling.it too late for u and the British people.sorry man
When you understand what a Marrano is, it all makes sense. Might be "british" but definitely NOT Welsh Irish Scottish English.
Given the chance the British public could never fairly elect a monarchy and if they did no one would agree, each candidate would get 25% of votes. In this instance better the devil you know than the devil you don't
I understand your perspective of expression, for example here in America it went from “sticking it to the man” to relying on the government, or the democratic socialist movement, and I also had the same feelings you do. I mean Robbin Hood is essentially a criminal to those in power, even though what he was doing was ethically righteous towards the common people. However, the world is a big place, and it’s good to have friends with power if your ideals align with each others. There are many variables in the perspective that you’re expressing. What if a rebellion does arise against the Monarchy absolutely, but the rebellion isn’t necessarily ethical. It sounds good on paper, but possibly not when it’s active.
You only have to ask, why’d they change the name to Windsor !!!
Everyone knows that the O’Flaherty have a more legitimate claim to the Crown and Throne of the United Kingdoms !

You have a King and his mistress running the show .. How discusting for the people of the UK....
What a sad  bloke you are., get back under the rock you from.
The “doo-ties” they carry out crack me up. 😂😂😂 Sometimes they actually allow a peasant to touch them!!
It's okay to be afraid, scared. Don't hide ,but put your armour on ? Most HIGH. Protect these people. When there gone. Don't say you never knew.
You can hardly move anywhere in those countries previously ruled by the British Empire without encountering a statue of that ugly- pudgy British (of  German origin) monarch, Victoria, or not encounter numerous buildings, towns, universities, street names, whole provinces in Australia, you name it.  While Boer women and children were dying in British concentration camps during the Boer War (1900 - 1902) in South Africa, she was probably partaking of afternoon tea with scones and clotted cream with her entourage at Fortnum and Mason. I wonder how much she knew about what her brave and revered Lord Kitchener was up to having the honor of establishing the first concentration camps in South Africa, or what "Chinese Gordon" was doing,  burning the summer palace in Beijing. The wheels of justice turn very slowly, and the Chinese have a nasty habit of never forgetting.  Britain could not possibly get rid of the monarchy since it is Britain´s main tourist attraction, an advertisement for British brands and products, and on top of that,  it makes the Americans envious . They also can outdo Hollywood with the splendid  shows they put on , with the endless procession of gilded carriages ,  the Rolls Royces, Daimlers, and Rover 4X4s, Charles´s Bond Street suits and ties, the jewels and grandeur of wealth and luxury, the palaces. If you want to keep people down and quiet (to know their place in society) give them a dose of this family´s "power" and majesty.
"Windsor Mafia"😊
it's like they can't give up living in a FairyTale ; kings, queens, princesses , Cinderella ! It's like a Disney movie in real life. Ridiculous.
The military industrial complex
That family makes me sick !
Down with the monarch!!!
Totally agree about the absurdity of the monarchy, but totally disgree that we have a strong anti-monarchy tradition. Most people are cringingly supportive of the monarchy... sadly
Excellent description
I have great respect for the late queen I believe that she made us proud to be members of this country but after seeing the actions this new king has sanctioned since her death  I have lost my respect for him and no longer see his need.
John Lydon turned out to be a wanker
They are no more corrupt than our government
What does WEF stand for??!?
And we are commoners
Regimes are in charge everywhere. Hostile take overs. Anti social personality disordered oppressors form cooperative cartels with each other. I believe these latest developing global mafias will bring about an apocalypse. I really do. See how well equipped they are with all their wrecknology. See their malign designs. The foretold is unfolding. IMO.
Well said 😊🐻🐵👍
🤘🔥🤘
The British public should be on the streets to oppose monarchy, British tax payers money should not be spent on kings funeral and coronation, they have more than enough money to fund that, if the French could do, why not the brits?
“The Americans will never shut up about their revolution” 1776 Babyyyyyyy., 1776. Have you heard about 1776? I looked at my watch today and it said 1776. If you add the numbers of 1776 you get 21 which is the right age to talk about what? 1776. I love the smell of gunpowder in the morning they said…back in 1776. 😬 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🤣🤣🤣

who Charles?
Totally agree with all hes said
Charles hands are not normal signs of illness, his hands are very swollen… having everything done for you is not a normal balanced lifestyle
Everyone should balk at being dubbed a "subject". The thought turns my stomach but so many people are content with that. I don't understand how you could have so little self respect.
REVERES ISLAM.... WAS MATES WITH JIMMY SA-VILE....AND WHAT HAPPENED TO DI....THAT SHOULD TELL YOU ABOUT CHARLIE....
Whilst all the tax is levied in their name and stuff is done in their name, the Royals are little more than a flock of budgies in a gilded cage. They have no real executive power but do have some influence, in the same way that Lady Gaga, being a random celebrity, has some influence.
VERY INTERESTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The only way the Monarchy will be abolished is when inflation reaches a high that people cannot afford to buy food. Parliament will blame the King and a Revolution will develop to oust them as the cause for their Extravagance. The military will be the force to end the monarchy when they do not receive a pay check... But realize, none of this will ever happen because the UK is part of a Global Banking system which will not allow the system to fail. So basically, you Brits are stuck with it and the only solution is to get as much out of it as you can.
I like this dude and agree with pretty much everything except the communist undertones
Are we going to break out ,lifes a puzzle,!!it seams to be breaking ,I'd love to know
I have as little time for the paedo gangsters as you do.   However, if you think other countries are so much better just because they don't have a monarch, I would not be so sure.   France experienced an extraordinary period of violence after the revolution, which culmulated in the rise of the Uber dictator Napoleon. Nowadays France has the most overreaching, nanny state government imaginable. If you think the rank and file will step into the space left by the royal family, at best you're a delusional romantic. The power vacuum will be filled by the state and big business. Normal people won't be relevant at all.
Ano you're born into this ,world ,where,they are in Charge ,so am wondering where was l before and what is this ,being born into a hive!!well something is up with the give a hive with different leaders ,this is our hive,!
Yep ,a would find it hard if they Rnt leading from the front less it was a queen!!
A like the lady's especially ANNE,WOOOO!
Yeah am not eating any bugs ,NOT THAT AN AWARE OF!!
Well you fought for them and they are still more interesting than the rest of you.
It's good to look back.  We are able to see & compare the different era.  Today, we are living in a different world.  Not easy for the young people, & seniors are living longer INDEPENDENTLY as 87% of seniors are educated in the British System Of Education.  Thank God for The Commonwealth. No government is perfect.  So stop picking on our Late Monarch, QE2.  I love her dearly.  RIP dear.
Ha made me laugh that we dress like a bunch of morans sucking up to these greedy, pompous, work shy idiots.
Bravo man ..king is not problem everubody know he is an idiot …elit is not problem…problem is so much stupid people who are blind and belive in lala land.. stupidity will ruin the world not evil
So proud of you.. spot on. I met him greedy sneaky and reckless. Watch your kids. Especially boys.  Not good not nice
There is a great documentary here on yt that is called "shadow world: The Global Arms Trade" which discusses the system that really seems to make many decisions for what happens around the world.  I think ALL soldiers should just lay down there arms and say "no we will not fight these wars for the rich to get richer" because that is all it is about... fuck building weapons of war! All the man power through labour and the resource being wasted just to send young men and women to their deaths or to be injuried both physically and psychologically and for what? More resources that the same rich arseholes want or "need" to continue producing these weapons and to keep the cycle going until the world is completely destroyed.  I don't see how anyone should want to continue fighting for people that don't know or care about them or their communities. Its nonsensical and we should stop killing each other to keep the rich maintained. They have blood on their hands
They can be so easily overthrown so mostly they spend their time acting and pretending knowing they need to keep the chain of power happy by pissing   in the pockets as they are the thread that holds the heavy pearls that are wealth clasps are the superiors the generals and the peals are the people its all  thinly walked line and they are vulnerable in  one way or another it will be ua who kills them or us who protects them. There is talk about a global famine coming, and also of these big food companies poisoning unwell know this the royals own a very large number of food companies. The potato famine in Ireland was not a natural famine the British royals and people took the food. If you watch the logistical issues and the reduced farm supply of meat and veg has been all fabricated and made to occur by stupidity by Charles and his mates trying to make it look like natural occurrences and climate change which pool there is not climate change every thing they do to us they make it sound like its for us...They make the decisions the do the harm and there is none our ability to control weather has been used to try and make obvious and harsh storms to fires and its easy to see they are not real. Theatre manipulation us remember China openly used weather manipulation to keep rain away from the olympics and Australia signed up for cloud seeding in 1947 to ensure the snowy river dam system was near dry or to never run dry making rain was the first manipulation we perfected so what are we having drought scour decades in some countries. Its manipulation they clear the people out and steal the rices or the put them into debt. Think rationally none of this is real they are killing economies internationally its admitted the WEF have said it well people tor retirement money we earned and sacrificed is all sitting losing and running out the economy our only its attached to our currencies they are dealing to push in digital money a new currency well if natural economic financial flux is not doing this and they are we can sue class action the world bank as they are defrauding us for their gain and we just take it., They are pushing high taxes upon land; lords to make them sell the homes to blackjack so the renter is being rogered it as is the land lord its fraud they manipulate the currencies to achieve agendas get smart each country sue get together its no = g=hard to prose natural ups and downs we believed it people its them and its our money we are the manipulation tools do they make us feel it all as then we can thank them, if they fix out all of this has been played out infant of us. Same as WEF no cl; use we have a counter idea its opposite to yours and we are bigger we will take the 99% and use it to wealth transfer from you to us and Bill Gates  mate sorry a man who advocates eugenics and openly is recorded telling the truth how many they can depopulate this year well he is attached ads the biggest investor into killer va$$s ...no excuses they sold one thing in replaced it and supples another full of proven toxins arrest him and thats a start he is charged with premeditated murder openly gloating he confessed.

❤Harry was so smart to get out
After so many centuries of lies and deceit, probably the working class in the UK "might" start to see and understand how stupid they've been by kneeling to all those lazy good for nothing privileged "royals"... Just observe and take a close look at the behavior of your new so called "king" and his heir, and his concubine "queen" , and that should be enough to Fking wake up from your self lapidating dream... Outrageous!
Musically, the Sleaford Mods are pretty hostile to the upper class and the crown.
Jesus when he comes with sort it out.
In the bible the first King appeared, King Saul because the people nagged for one. The prophet Samuel said that by getting a king they would be oppressed and poor . They still wanted one rather than serve God their creator. The rest is history.
What is the title of your book? Iwill order it immediately!
King Charles could redeem himself if he stood up for his people, I wonder if he will.
Thank you. Tired of hearing from royal loving boot lickers.
All that you’ve said, I’ve been trying to get across for a long time!!! The Windsors are a waste of time,energy, resources, and money!
Bravo on speaking the truth. The Royals are human waste and and beyond evil!
He’s no King.
You Brits should close down the kingdom of disruction no wonder the first Charlie lost his head probably for a  good reason and turn to the kingdom of God ❤
Who ARE these bloody people ? WHAT are these bloody people ? ? WHY are these bloodY people ? ? ?
Spot on ! ! !
Why the hell they give money to the crown? they are the biggest thief on the planet. Just look at the defected inbreed called Henry.
Not all didn't serve Andrew served in the Falkland s campaign, Edward did actually pass Royal marine selection, Philip was actually a commander in the Navy, Harry did actually go to Afghanistan so maybe get all your facts right However I do agree with most of your other comments
I've been saying this for years. I  just don't understand why people fall over themselves for them
The people from Britain, innocent people stand for humanity rights
✔✔
What a bitter man who needs to learn value, respect and the. Horrifying world of communism. Learn from the past !
Since we lost the princess, he doesn't count for dung
The "royal" family are native Germans; were loyal to Hitler. This is because the British royal family has roots in the Thuringian city, and has lived in Switzerland for several generations, or to be more precise, descended from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha - only the royals changed their name to "Windsor" over 100 years ago. They have no legitimacy to the royal throne, they have stolen it!
Are really English?
"ROYALS" are nothing more than squatters and beggars in my book...scavengers..!!
💯💯💯💯💯
That gang wouldnt last 5 minutes on the streets of Albuquerque lmao
If you would of lived in the time's of Pharaoh you would kiss the feet of king's Charles  you sound bitter a bit like everyone that criticises anyone who has power given by heaven's for a reason beyond tiny minds.
Smashingly correct
Agreed.
Great exposure... Sre u still answering comments. ? 🍀🍀
Windsors? Lol you mean the Saxe-Coberg's...
This country is supposed to be a democracy, I dont remember voting for the Royal family.
As a former soldier, you are a disgrace. Your lack of insight and real knowledge. I wonder why you're a former soldier. You're definitely a Corbynite.  You must be so proud.
Thanks for the truth! The monarch is the reason many countries are broken. In South Africa, the monarchy has tapped us DRY of valuable resources. The  biggest diamond in the royal crown, comes from us. The monarchy is on the head of the Illuminati goals. Did you ever hear the words: "Keep Africa Poor"? Thanks for your videos. With love from South Africa
True. Royals regard "work" as cutting ribbons. They don't know what the word WORK means.
criminals
I understand you are a former soldier, a volunteer, not a pressed man. You took the kings shilling. Shame on you!! you volunteered to be a paid assassin, disgusting, a hired killer. Willing to go abroad and make war on innocent people. How many innocents did you kill during your ''Service to King and country''? Or would you rather not say? Some are quite happy to brag about their kill-rate, remember the American sniper, 600 he claimed. At least, a friend blew his head off. Karma? Or what.
We know all this. When do you get to the exposing part. Or was just clickbait.
So true
They royal family looks at the uk like peasants just like in the 1700's 1800's  .
If the Britain's had mafia then atleast there would be a resistance.
Why dont yall get him out of there i dont get it
😄
The royal family are of immense value to our nation , bringing in millions as ambassadors for trade and tourism, as well as giving British subjects a sense of identity and allegiance to the crown , which most republics don't have , having a president for 4 years is nothing like having a monarch for life..
I would like to see the🇬🇧UK People (including the🇮🇪Irish and🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿Scots) take back what's⚖️rightfully theirs, which is everything the👑Royal family💭thinks they £own$ and is theirs. ⚔️🛡The Royal family should humbly be giving back everything they didn't earn, with a great big💔apology to the citizens of the🇬🇧UK. The👑Royal Family's takes better care of their🩸bloody🏇🏼RaceHorses (for🏆trophies and🎀ribbons) than they do it's own💔citizens. With all due respect, I am not celebrating His Majesty's King Charles III Cancer diagnosis and I don't wish any ill will on him and anyone else or thing. 💐Thanks for sharing.
I am amazed the British people never put two and two together re WW1 - a battle between two families, German cousins
As an American, it's refreshing to see a Brit be honest about "The Royal Family".
King Richard the Third was the last true King of England. But "History is written by the Victors" so only the lies prevail
I don’t get the purpose of the royal family.
I live in NZ listening to Maori demanding their birth right for land that was not theirs in the first place they came from Polynesia.  When British people who’s families have lived in the UK  for generations have no rights at all.  Emigration has achieved what two world wars failed to do.   Britain no longer belongs to the British we don’t even have a PM who’s ancestry goes back 1 generation and would not be sworn in on the bible.
What a 😂 you are.. you uses’t to be a soldier, but you quite happily took the queens oath to serve and protect, and here you are slating the Monarch… 😂🤡😂🤡
Where did Charles get all that medals ??.🙋‍♀️😂😂
Jew's mate , Gypsies. Al the kingshouses in Europe and their Government's. They bullshit you on their tv , newspapers ext.
Former British Army soldier Joe Glenton deserves the highest decoration for patriotism  there is for this frank outlook.
But 90% of the plebs are brainwashed,so we are stuck with the Royal scroungers!
Hazel O'Connor has an album called Breaking Glass from the 80s. Listen to the whole album and you will see EVERY song she sang about is actually what's happening in the World today, it's very bizarre 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🥃
The royals are so rich and powerful and want to keep every bit of it. None for anyone else. We have all been brainwashed but everyday the mask slips a little more and we are seeing who they really are, especially with regard to the King, and William. Big question...where is Kate??
Just another winging POME. Thinks he is a hard worker and expert. Has no comprehension of the difficult diplomatic role, legal work and the important public relations work load of the Royal family. The New World Order first has to get rid of the Old World Order.
I have been attacked an ridiculed for years whilst highlighting the millstone around the neck of the British people is Monarchy and always has been.
To right sir
Jesus is The Way, The Truth, and The Life John 14:6
Bring in money.... I am Danish - I never visited London because of the royal family, I don't know anyone who did. I abhor them as much as I abhor the Danish royal family - we don't need them! They are murderers and thieves - all their jewelry is stolen from the colonies, and If not for World War I, the British royal family would still go by a German name. The House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha stemmed from the marriage in 1840 of Queen Victoria to Albert, the scion of a modest royal dynasty from northeastern Bavaria.
Not sure I entirely agree with this. I do believe that the Royal family should be scaled down but we do need this system in place to safeguard us from the horror of a dictatorial regime (like Nazi Germany or Communist Russia). When we did have a republic under Oliver Cromwell, it became a dictatorship.
People should ask themselves,  'What has the monarchy done for me '?
Clickbait
You just have to open your eyes read history  from round the world and the truth there for all to see your eyes will be opened wide
I totally agree, but for this to work we need to reform politics, ourdays elected representatives behave more and more like royalty, obsessed with their on weatlh and power rather that what they were "elected",( but are they?), to do
I am surprised that you can talk about them that way. Good for you. I think of them as clowns in a circus.
"GOD"not man is king 🧐🤔🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫
I love this man!
I agree that the royals are hiding a great deal of information the public are entitled to have. The money they have is used to make more money for themselves. Much of what you say resonates with me
WEF very dangerous organisation
Love it good for u sir.
I've paid 5 years of my life to understand what "governmental funds" for business are .
Update please on the new royal yacht, the one to replace Britannia. They are keeping it very quiet, they only announced it after the death of the duke of Edinburgh (imagine their mindset, waiting for Philip to die and announcing the new royal yacht with the pretext that it was to be built in his honour). So there are record number of food banks, people living in poverty, fuel and energy crisis and Charles and Camilla are having a new yacht being commissioned.
The Royals got rich by not paying any taxes for years.
First step: Strip PH & M Markle & "their children" of all titles & financial support.
Trying to post book recommendation:The A-C & A Cup Of Tea.
A must read book for all U.K. & USA citizens, world citizens: The Anti-Christ & A Cup Of Tea. It's an eyeopener, not just for Christians.
EXACTLY ❤
Most British people agree with everything this man is saying, we no longer require a  Royal Family along with all hangers on and scroungers.
I second every comment you made. Bunch of lazy morons?
So true, thank you for sharing... the royal family are parasites of the worst order..  France has bigger tourism with no royals...  fire the royals and open Buckingham Palace for tours.
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🎉❤
I don't like this Royal family.The cheaters child molesters they Make the woman disappear diana catherine and Megan. It's amazia cult
Who is this peevish git?
Satanic Freemasons who worship and are in line with the beast system. Blood lines are so important that inbreading has been common practice, leading to sick disorders such as a tendency to children. But brushed under the carpet. They truly have their reward because they will be judged by the true king at the front of the battle and non of them have fired a shot in anger. A drain on the British people
You make a truly great point about the people not being educated about the 17c.  It matters far more than the Tudors.
You leave the king alone. ……….stop looking for media attention fool .
I agree get rid of the monarchy I don't like the royales . I only liked Princesses Diana and they killed her
Give em a council flat and a funny hat  thay love there funny hats
At last a like mind to listen to! Just one thing to disagree on. England has never had a revolution but only a war between two levels of society.
Charles the turd
The Royal Family are wonderful.  They deserve their wealth.  Nurses and Teachers  are  not in the same rank.
Well said 👌🏻
The ignorant people on here amuse me no end. I have followed Charles career for fifty years. The best royal ever. Has done more for the country than other person. All the ignorant anti British on here is disgusting. People on here need to understand they need to do hell of a great deal of study . His work as the Duke of Cornwall, caring more about British traditions, skills and traditional jobs. I know he is considered to left wing by some but he is a real patriot. My god he was married to Di Spencer, that deserves a medal. The anti Charles mob skewed everything against Charles. I read the comments on here and I see people who have not got a bloody clue. He works for us not like politicians who work for themselves. As a true PATRIOT I can smell Marxists and Irish anti Brits a mile away. Some people just don’t understand the truth. If you want to live in a country that is a Republic go and live Ireland, North Korea and so on.
He's jewish i know that but  I don't understand why any person with brains would want to throw the genes away of good humans away ,we as people would now be expected to live alongside these migrants and throw away our culture i dont think it works that way it would be to dificult to alter course
Theres something fundementaly wrong with you mate! How did Cromwells tyrany end mate?  Not too well , the people couldnt wait for Charles II to come back. Today would be much worse with a peoples Commonwealth.
You sound like a pommie wineing loser mate
What's your point?
Who cares really?Who cares?They're a pieces of s***Everybody knows it
We need to get the id of the monarchy, they stand for exclusion , elitism , hereditary power & privilege . The argument about the so called " Royals" bring in money for the country. To which I say do tourists meet them in person when they arrive ? No they don't , so people would still come for the history like they do in Republican France at the Palace of Versailles. We waste £350 million a year on these scroungers.
As an American, whose family has been in America since it was a colony, why the hell do I have a negative gut reaction to hearing “abolish” the monarchy
ex soldier, your full of crap you prat.
We all need to stop recognising these freeloaders
I met Charles in New York back in the 1970's. My impression of him was that he was an arrogant, spoiled, overage child with sausage fingers.
All this and not a mention of freemasonry or bohemia grove...
❤ Beware  Charles, the I am is on your side.
Sex Pistols!
the royal family helped fund hitler.  that's all you need to know.  oh yeah. and they are german, not english, which explains the above.
There is no point abolishing the monarchy without reclaiming all the lands and property. Not just the royals too but the entire class of nobles and mega rich. And not the crown estates but also the property they claim to be family wealth but only have from generations of the royal delusion.  There should be a minimum and maximum wealth.
Love your choice of words 😂😂😂
Monarch are pedophiles in secret.
Didnt Mountbattens wife say all he cared about were his pretty uniforms...lol  and not to mention how debauched they both were . the whole thing is just a painful joke with Charlie and his lil brother
The Apocalypse is coming.  In Greek means "the unveiling"  the Apocalypse of the old guard.
Sorry the French model does not exist anymore!  There is no liberty, fraternity or equality here now King Macron is on his throne.  He who owns the land - the elite is planning worse I would think as Charles is in Davos and is probably into eugenics.
Well now  king Charles isnt doing anything helpful  while our country is taken away from us ,his ancestor's  would turn in there graves
You've got serious issues mate you're a hypocrite mate cos we all signed up and swore allegiance to the king or queen I'm glad I never served with you you're a liability
Those were the fattest fat fingers I've ever seen
The best solution would be to recover most of the properties for the benefit of the people and rein in the monarchy to the budgetary size of the European monarchies.  This would be the least shocking to the country and people could still have their monarchs without being bled dry to have them.
Yes!!!  Take the properties and tax them and set up trusts to help the people.
YES DITCH THE MONARCHIST. IT IS TIME THEY WENT. THEY ARE NOT HONEST, THERE BACK GROUND IS GERMAN, SO WHO ARE THE TRUE ROYALS? There name got changed to Windsor, so would not be rounded up in the war with all the other germans?  How can this be allowed.
Yes i agree with you totally. The King Charles needs to fall. InFact the total Royal needs to be pulled down. There is more Darkness behind the RF. There back ground, is German, they are not true Royals.
Sir thank you for being honest .
Arms industry is pure evil.....
He's running low......
Go study stock market and start trading as a professional then you will stop barking at wrong trees. Please don't join fake institutions to start your training and I can assure you you will regret why you waisted your time and energy trying to change the world that was modeled many many millions of years to just one direction. A  vulture is a patient bird, at the end the day, it always dine.
Brilliant video. Never liked the royal family, don't hate them, but let's be honest they don't serve any purpose.
You and my dad would be best friends 🤣 you sound exactly like him
well said Joe top man
GOD SAVE KING CHARLES 3RD
If we've got to give up all our basic living standards for this WEF puppet king. Then it's time to end wasting money on this pampered out of touch royal family.
Where’s the WORLD WIDE DECENT towards the WEF ?
They enabled and shielded monsters like Saville the pedo.
Just like the U.S., you are a product of who you have voted into office, policies you have bent over for.  Conformists.
Their all LIZARDS!! 😂
I swear this man came into a place in Utah I was working and purchased cigarettes. This man was very polite soft spoken even had the British accent he didnt seem like anything special to me. He was alone and had a very nice Black car and an expensive  suit It wasnt until later that i put two and two together. I also seen Post Malone and again didnt realize until after i just remembered thinking why did you ruin your pretty little face.  Im oblivious and or i dont really look up to or go crazy after famous or known people. They are just human anyhow and truth be known the bloodlines are so messed we dont know whos who or where or what the royal bloodline is
Teachers , doctors and nurses working for a pittance. Don't make me laugh. You're completely wrong. Wrong wrong wrong.
Well said topman
He took advice from Jimmy Savile, nuf said.
Hell, there is inequality even in America today! The politicians and their handlers have enslaved the public with "freedom and democracy" BS. They are slowly strangling the rights of the public to take their money through "digital currency" and quashing the peoples right to speak freely by bringing laws like claiming criticism of individuals based on religion, race, political affiliation and the list goes on. Same shite goes on in the UK. Oh yes they serve in the military, bullshit. Get them on the front lines dodging bullets, mortars, missiles, bombs and IED'S. If they are killed so be it, at lest they died on the front lines. Look at General Norman  Swartskof I. The first Kuwaiti war. As a veteran of the Vietnam conflict, he told the politicians to go pound sand that HE was the commander in Chief of these forces. He went in, got the job done by getting Sadam out of Kuwait and he called it over. Politicians wanted him to continue the war back to Iraq but he said NO. The mission was to get Sadam out of Kuwait and nothin more. He did wreak havoc with the republican guard forces of Sadam and destroyed almost all of their equipment in the process.
True Americans stand with you Brother.   We are in the same boat just with a "dEmOcRaCy" bow attatched.
IF they did not want you to see this video you would not be seeing it. It is up to us to realize that they are controlling the information. What is the benefit for them to put out this information at this moment? People must know that the people in all levels of government are involved in hiding generational paedophilia and Satanic Ritual Abuse and Sacrifice. Are we going to integrate the intelligence of creation and not go into shame, blame, guilt, and condemnation. We can only move to higher states of consciousness when we recognize that we are the one holding ourselves in the mental constructs. What we do not learn about in school is the fact that the public servants are the fiduciaries of the public trust. We are the beneficiaries. They want you to believe that you are a "poor" peasant. The fact is our wealth is being stolen at the local courthouse. Why do we continue to apply for licensing and services? It is up to us to empty ourselves of all false narratives and stand up as the beneficiary.
Prince Philip 'lived' up to his wish to come back as a disease, but he came back as a cancer in Queen Charles' body
Did someone give him cancer. He sounds dangerous too. I don’t know why but I dreamed King Charles when he was prince Charles. I was a passenger he and his wife were in the back seat and the driver was a woman and I felt she did t like Charles and he knew it. At the end of the dream prince Charles and his wife come to me to give me a gift because they are leaving to go back to their home. But in a another dream that gift he gave me a woman is handing out to people that same gift she did t give me one.
There not even British there German there original name is Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and yes they are gangsters that’s why they call them selfs the firm Germany Got rid of them because there family were know for being treacherous traitors the gangster family is like a albatross round Britains neck .
MAYBE  IT'S.  TIME. TO.  SAY.  BYE BYE    TO. ROYALITY,  I NURSED    FOR £145.  A.  MONTH,     NOW. A. PENSIONER.     HEATING,, OR. EATING,  IS MY. GAME  THANK   YOU.  SIR.  FOR.  YOUR   PO ST,    IT'S.  , A.  VERY.  BIG.  EYE.  OP ENER, ❤🌹
COMMUNIST ONE WORLD GOVERMENT MEMBETS IS WHAT THEY ARE.
Can’t stand Charles however I liked his mother
You give Very light coverage as to the Tyrant cromwell was....just getting rid of kings is not enough your revolution foundered on the rocks of cromwell then, when the ship was rebuilt, went back to monarchy TWO failures in a row
I don't think you understand that the "monarchy" is much a puppet of the bankers
Well spoken!
Some interesting points raiseedd here, I am also an ex Army person. After the scandal with the Andrew and Mountabatten what's next! I say relocate Andrew to a council flat in New Cross and see how he copes in real life.
You have a way of motivating people and send shivers up there neck, goosebumps ❤
Whilst I loved Diana and like Kate, the reality is Britain is great without it! We don’t need them! We have plenty to unite over and people will still come here even so due to all we have. Totally agree about all the fakery.. like the uniforms. How dare they!  Another thing : their last name is not Windsor even! The Germanic family only adopted that name fro  the castle to hide the fact how German they were and make them sound more English! Do you really think Brits would be so enamoured adulating their  sovereign “Saxe Cothburg Gotas”- their real names!  The whole concept of “royalty” and subjects and blue bloods goes against the very concept of a true democracy. They fool themselves. People are sheep and no I’m not a rabid socialist but à conservative!  When the late Queen died, it would have been a perfect time to say thank you for bejng a bridge from tjr Ear to now but we don’t need you lot anymore! It would have been a good time to retire them all.. then they can stop their complaints about intrusion and live like normal people .
Charles is pathetic, but Camila is grotesque. Together they are the perfect embodyment of the monarchy.
Most all of the arsehole leaders of the world are true psychopaths. They have no care or concern for the population. It's all power and their wealth and everyone else can go to hades. The so called leaders of the world need to be removed and the system of elections and who oversees them needs to be in the hands of the people.
With you here. When you join up you sign an Attestation certificate..which is an oath to protect the crown, not the people of this country.
Look at Russia. Got rid of royal family sins then all distroyed. All went to hell, 80% of people was killed in Russia sins death of royal family only first 2 years. Then 57 mln in gulag. .   All elit was killed. Country enslaved for 100 years  , all resorses went for free oversease  become donor for world as all gold, country resorses stolen . Now if dont eat out of rubbish bin, wont servivw.  Churches distroyed,  all prists killed  Country in hell already 100 years now nearly all russuand dead. It a price of loosing a  King. People dont understand value of king untill he gone. Russians know.  200 mln on  in comparison to loses from death of royals is nothing. comparison to what value king give is nothing. Ask Russians  how is it without king. Total death and distraction.   Without king they went from number 1 in world to number last. Seriously.   You think all equal? Why then noone can do what royals did?  We are not equals. For me it obviouse russian rotals was Divine. Now wuthout them hell and death, total death.  Think.  Russians want King back.
When King Charls landed on Australia during gis last visit that day lotto numbers lined up. 2 3 4 5 6 7. I noticed it. But media sad nothing about it.  It was quite impressive . It is Divine Powers  that proof  he is yrue king. It could be frod , staged up or done by magicial like Koperfield.  I also had huge karma clearing that day . That proved he is Divine King. People dont understand  worth of Divine beeng  for country or community.  It huge. One divine beeng protect country from ecological catastrophs, keep morals, ethics and stop crimes.  One only khow when King gone. It secret knowlege tought in spiritual academies  but people not interested.  Divine beeng not like humans. Different value.  Just with presence he protect continent . Look at what happened when they killed russian royal family.  After this 80% of population was killed , and sins then greate suffering for people. Hundreds of millions killed sins hus death. Decline in everything.  Such is power of King  So 200 mln is nothing in comparison to what he contribute if he real King.  King must be Saint. I am not shure if he is one.  We will find put when royals gone. If what in russia happens then he was real.   I felt his powerfull presence when he came to Australia.  When numbers line up like this it mean he is Divine King.   I know when i went onto divine state number plates lined up  9999 Or  234567.  Perfect order as i became perfect.  So may be ge is Divine. If lotto numbers line up 234567.
How is this guy still alive? 😅😅
Royalists are the saddest fucking sheep on the planet.
Hey don’t worry your dream of having a Muslim nation will soon be realized and you can cry in relief.
I Agree with you, this also applies to the Dutch royal family. Both corrupt to the bone.  Royalty was instituted, but not with the intention of oppressing the people, harming them, but to serve.  Moreover, as occult as it can be. Participate in secret occult meetings.  Both the British and Dutch royal family are seasoned WEF adepts and visit Bilderberg meetings.  They are extremely rich, moreover, while there is poverty and visible misery in their own country.  There is only one King, the King the kings, and His Kingdom is not of this fallen corrupting world. It belongs to the prince of the world, satan. More and more we see the closing ranks and the signs of the times, as described in Matthew 24.   Didn't Jesus say, I must go, for the prince of this world is coming, and I have no use for me?  Folks, make sure that darkness has no use for us either.  You did a good job, brave soldier, and expose the works of darkness and exhibit them.  They also have been known to consult spirits and hold seanses. Conforming to the NWO elite of which they may be a part?  In any case, questionable bloodlines and feats of arms.  But it is not too late for them either, when they come to the acknowledgment of their evil works, and bow their heads before the Almighty and truly serve the people.  But in the meantime, we have to expose the works of darkness and exhibit them. You did a good job soldier.  Every one will see Him the Lord, and every knee will bow.  Choose this day whom will serve you, Jesus the Way, the Truth and the Life.
Old fashioned
Once Islam is done with King Charles, he'll just be another victim, just like the rest of us.  It's only a matter of time before traitors turn, and show their true intentions; as they always have.
<3 Truth is the only valuable commodity. I thank you, kind sir, for your sacrifice!
Im not anti royalist but the royal family cost us. Read Norman Baker very interesting, book and what do you do? To many Presidents of republics are no better. I never want a President Bliar or Thatcher
People love the peaky blinders. I'm sorry but this would be better aimed at the government for causing the desperate situation this country is in.
I would love the king to provided us with his thoughts on this video  What say you
Those jousters are bout popular as a hair on a buiscuit.
Meanwhile We over here in the US have 1 of your wacked out prince trying to Subvert Our Constitution 1st Amendment! Hopefully we'll be able to deport him back to you. Some of US can see that a lot Our issues has been attributed by the UK trying to take control..A sort of revenge for the global embarrement the monarchy suffered when We fought for Our Own Governance.  IRELAND has never given up trying to get the hidden hand out of their Country! We here in the US have current issues of our elitist thinking we'd be better letting them govern the rest of our populace while they set up their little principalities right here. Those days are over! NO One should have to Starve & live as paupers. Good Luck to you and your Countrymen.
If it were not for Major Johnny Thompson and the beautiful Princess of Wales and little Charlotte the coronation was basically a yawn! 🥱 The carriages and the horses were lovely.
Equality. What is that? The only thing that should be equal is access to the Law, Rights and Justice enshrined in a written Constitution. No other equality exists or can exist.
What a rubbish video, full of fake information.
I agree but don't forget the banking system which is also corrupt
The royals bring in money .......FOR THE RICH😆😅😂🤣

well, the crown bankers for centuries have been the Rothschilds, who were once called Elkann(from an ancient family of rabbis), but changed their name in Germany. In Italy the Elkann family dominates and has been exploiting the state for years, financially doing what they want without any problems or charges. I think the same thing applies to the English crown, furthermore it is said that they have family ties with the Rothschilds.
There combined wealth is 2 billion sterling. No wonder they live so long, they get everything done for them. The Queen started paying tax followed by the rest of them in 1992. 😳 😳 😳
Humpty Dumpty fall down.  Nobody can put the king together again.
This talk is not only mean, coarse, and base, it is also false!
Bloody brilliant and i 100,000% agree
How will we keep the WEF lap dogs from being elected when so many are blind to them? At this point in time the “Monarchy” are a safety catch
This family has their hands full of blood and souls
❤ second that

It bothers me this family has attacked almost every country on the world. it's palace build on blood of many civilizations. It's people pay taxes and workers don't deserve any rights; WHY THEY STILL BOWIN ADMIRE and CARE FOR WHATEVER magazine the pos as "tradition" model rol
He don’t do any think important in world just he’s and family Burden in people of UK
All the Satanic elites are inbreed bar stewards  and probably from Iran too? Too many getting back handers over here they also need to be name and shamed and arrested a long with the Black prince who serves the Dragon ..atb

The entire world of leaders no matter what their titles are have lost their fear of God. Now chaos will reign because their are no morals, no code of conduct to restrict bad behavior. The massive killing off of the unborn has made killing palatable. When respect for human life has been eliminated, we as a people are in trouble.
vile and misrepresentation of the British Royal family you say you are a former soldier i do not believe it one minute you are ineducated and disloyal to the UK
Bunch of tugs & power drunk lunatics who think everyone else is their slaves!!!😢😢
This is communist talk 🙄
I always say that the royal family live in the most expensive council houses in the country. Those palaces are ours and they live in them. Theft!
1:55  With the support of the Anglian Whig aristocracy, Prince William [of Orange] convened an illegal parliament at Westminster on 26 December 1688, and the politicians were held at gunpoint to vote in respect of a dynastic change..[the press reporting that]..’the Convention Parliament was in no way at liberty to vote according to conscience because Prince William’s soldiers [Vatican Guard I believe]  were stationed within the House and all around the Palace of Westminster........William employed actual intimidation which resulted in majorities of one vote in two of the most important divisions in the history of Parliament’. [i.e. William was working in particular for Dutch commercial interests in the heart of his enemy and in general for Catholic oriented centrist European interests 🤡🌎🎶🍄🌗🌚🌓
2022-2023 over 100 Billionaires have died and just as many Millionaires. Also hundreds of CEOs have lost jobs. I wonder why?.
It would be a mistake to have an elected head of state. The two kinds of public officials are those who are elected (politicians) and those who are appointed by those who are elected (civil servants). It is the elected who decide public policy because they have the political authority to do so, having been elected by the people. Civil servants, on the other hand, have constitutional powers to implement the policies decided by the elected government, but no political authority/power to decide what those policies will be. It is only the elected who have the power/authority to decide public policy. If a head of state is appointed by the people's elected parliament, that appointed head of state has no political authority/power to decide public policy. That appointed head of state is therefore a civil servant with prescribed duties and no more. If the head of state is elected by the people, that head of state has political authority, having been elected by the people, so can decide public policy and/or refuse to sign into law legislation passed by the houses of parliament. When the President (elected) of the USA does this, they call it a Veto. The US President is a king by another name; and a true monarch in that sense. The Americans made the mistake of having an elected head of state, and look what that has led to. What kind of crazies will get elected down through the years if your head of state is elected? Better to keep all political power and authority in the people's elected parliament, with government by cabinet. It is a mistake to concentrate political power and authority into the hands of just one person. Let a vote of the cabinet decide, not the personal opinion of just one person. And remember, the appointed position of head of state is therefore ceremonial, for fixed periods, and can be downsized to something appropriate. Also, if an appointed head of state is found to be behaving inappropriately, for whatever reason, the people's elected parliament can remove that person from office and replace them.
I agree with you 100 per cent it’s a royal coven of EVIL
Never had The Public Seen Such a Miserable Presence of a Royal, Who was about to receive a 👑! Sadly, he said, “Thank You, William.” For Showing Up? What a Spectacle!
They do what they think they are priviliged to do.  They believe they descend from all royal bloodlines.  Look up "Sovereign Immunity".    What a load of bollocks!! "They can do wrong".  However globally children go missing in THOUSANDS!!!!!!

Thank you for sharing such true information. The Windsors are evil in all ways.
The Royal Family is the personification of the Establishment.  Their entire purpose is to protect their own and maintain power over the masses. I speak as a former monarchist. Thankfully I woke up and saw through the smoke and mirrors.
Hear hear!  And the rest of the leach royals while at it.  In all monarch countries
The Royals have been promoting shamelessly for close to 20+ years because I think they are part of the NWO and had to present the positive and controlled narrative so they could continue as royalty and we'd never see the underside. And, the Netflix show the crown has been an excellent example of this. But, Charles is a crowned king of bankers. He's not the king of England anymore. There are very interesting time happening now.
I luv it.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The most hilariously ironic fact in British history is that the “Windsors” are actually German: the Sax-Coburgs and Gothas.
Britain was conquered in 1066.  Still the same.  The people are labourers and gun fodder. Cromwell was funded by Amsterdam Jews.  Out of the frying pan into the fire.
Crook in highest place...
❤
Never heard of the Levelers. Wonder why.😮❤
All of them enjoying blood money
That palace is a criminal organization with criminal gangs
so Harry was right to flee to america when he feared for the safety of his family.   now kate is missing.
The French got rid of their royal family, and France brings in just as much tourism money for viewing of palaces etc as if they were alive. So the uks royal supporters who defer to the premise that the uk royals bring in more tourist dolllars than are spent on them are using unaccurate data. And the uk royals are banking upon the populaces ignorance of the facts, and their habituated brainwashed familial deference.
Prince Harry was on active service with at least two tours of Afghanistan. He even had to fight to be allowed to do his job! Granted the rest of them are a shower of sh*te but leave our Ginger nuts alone.😯
Hear Hear!!! 👍🏼👏🏻 Actually more German Nazis than even British. 🤨
I'VE  COME  TO  REALIZE  ,  THAT  BEING  CIVILIZED ,  DON'T  REALLY MEAN NOTHING ...  SO  AM  GOING  BACK  TO  THE  WILD ,  BEFORE   ITS  ALLOVER ......
imo you're right and wrong in the same sentence.  One thing IS true though, you have VERBAL DIARRHOEA and a "chip on your shoulder!"
Today Royalty and Governments are just the best gangs of these large areas.  Think of them as mega-corporations that are not connected to the rules or laws we poors are subjected to.  They are honorless, physically old, and weak with total control of all of us.  America is so ripe for our 2nd Revolution.  Look around all of us are suffering and every day it gets worse and worse.  Our weakness and inability to take it back will hurt us all when this country crashes.
REPTILIANS mate, shapeshifter REPTILIANS!  The  lizard people! Look deep into old films of the royals and you will see skin scales. Princess Dianne saw it!
When Queen Elizabeth II died, it made the British Monarchy NO longer relevant......   Look how Diana, Princess of Wales  was treated by The Firm.
you are ridiculous
The royals are nothing more than a welfare family.
Nasty nasty 😠 I am a SA, I love the RF, the King is a good hearted person 😡
A bit much m8. I think you're just bitter about your lot in life. I do think you're a bit of an idiot when it comes to this. Tear it all down hey? That's amazing doctrine. Just rip it all down, yeah m8, because republics really work don't they.
Joe, as an American, I agree with you and I love your videos. There were many times throughout the course of British history where the people thought about getting rid of the royalty altogether. The closest they came was to limit the powers of the royalty and have a prime minister. In theory, nobody should bow  down to another human being. I think, the British people, especially the women, like the celebration of royalty and the tradition of royalty. That is a British thing us Yanks can’t understand. A few years ago, I remember the British people were outraged over the amount of money spent on the royalty. It made Prince Charles take notice and wisely he didn’t want to flaunt it in the commoners’ faces. Still, old traditions never die. Btw, the older pic of you in uniform, I must say, you were quite a looker. Cheers! 😂
I am an American and don't understand the nature of your system,but I have a tremendous respect for The UK. I can't begin to discuss with you what you speak of, however I am confused about the income of The Royals ( do you capitalize this) as I thought they only received protection as compensation and not actually tax money. Another thing, would should you deelelevate The Monarchy, would this not be an extremely destabilizing force in Western Culture? Would it not appear to be, let's say a bit Marxist? I respect your achievements , service, and obvious educational level and in no way intend disrespect sir, I am only confused about the issues and wish information from both sides.
God bless you! Much love from the heart of the American empire. Much love from Africa. We hope you Anglo-Saxons can finally free yourselves from your overlords. The whole world will benefit from your struggle and sacrifice. #WakeUp #GetOut #SaveTheChildren
You sound incredibly bitter. 😢
RIGHT ON.
Not wrong
I luv it.😂😂😂😂
Meanwhile...the NHS is so underfunded that I've been waiting nearly a year for treatment but here's taxpayers money to pay for the funeral of one of the richest women alive (oh and we'll write off death duties as well)
Thanks Debbie u are so right girl.❤❤❤
Thats why Harry fled good for u boy.
And they talk about Maghan, no shame Chales and the rest.😂😂😂
The British worship the royal family like Gods for some reasons.  Is it because of the water they drink or food they eat?  Why do they feel the need to degrade themselves in front of those useless parasites?  I could never understand this.
As an American living here in England for little over 4 years now, I've heard very mixed things from those very loyal to the monarchy and those against it.  I came here partly swept away by the glamour of it all honestly - note in the US, the royal family is splattered everywhere on magazine covers and gossip columns etc., but taking a deeper dive into colonial history, WEF, comparing the freedoms and rights of US vs UK government set-up (btw, I don't believe ours is perfect)....I've really come to agree with this soldier.  It seems a lot of people dislike Charles and Camilla, but really "love" Kate and William.  Kate almost seems like a 2nd Diana in the eyes of those that love the royal family, which is scary in a way because they are a young couple that could rise to power and stay in that position for quite a long time and be adored by people, even the younger generation of Brits.  Her cancer diagnosis also seems to be pulling more public sympathy.  I've heard many Brits say that Charles should have abdicated and given the crown to William.  I would love some responses, especially feedback on William and Kate being more popular than Charles.
I think you should go on TV ? This is very good cos . But I really think the monarch is finished.
Sounds pissed as he didn't come home with a chest full of medals. If you don't like the country we got airports get on a plane and go elsewhere
I have 1 word for you. Food for thought ! "LOYALTY"
Too late since King Chuckles is now firmly ensconced on his throne in his bunker getting a “Wet wipe” from Middleton as she plays “Monkey on the middle” between old man Rothschild now that he’s had enough of Chuckles backside he’s giving her the old “Khazar Slide” and Chuckles gets to sit there watching until WW3 is over and 7.5 Billion are dead exactly as Charlie told the world they were going to do for 25 years.
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
Love the video. Agree with everything you said. I think they're spongers

Long live 'Brave Sir Robin' .
20 million he spent for his crowns 👑 day , from our income Not his own pocket 🎉
So true!
Do you think lizzie ever gave Phil a blowie?
I find it fascinating that after the Queen died the RF appears to be falling apart at a rapid rate. Old Charlie boy can't even hold his family together but ‘rules’ over the Commonwealth…what a joke. I can see a day when the Windsor will be a footnote in history & I don't think it's far away. Dirty dishwater is more appealing & interesting than Charles & William, neither of them have any charisma or personality. Hopefully, in Australia, we will become a republic ASAP.
John Lydon should step up
A soulless being.
Hate them as you may but without them, Britain would be a tiny, little backwater ignored by the world and forgotten.  Who ralfed on your Wheatabix?  Another miserable little squid.  Yeah, they aren't all that's cracked up to be but some of them DO work although it may not be YOUR kind of work.  And how many of them would YOU like to kill?  Oh come on mate, don't be shy, isn't that what you were trained for?  To KILL?
The “Windsors” ARENT even British!! They are GERMAN + ARE INBRED!! 🤢
What I find disgusting is the anointing and pretense to be so Godly. Let’s realize all of that is because crazy Henry the VIII changed the church. We should revisit the reformation.
Says it as it is
A family of reptillians they have been seen shape shifting
That's exactly how it is in mirror image Ireland.
The money it costs alone for all their pomp and circumstance. The big show where ever they go, the money ever country has to put out to have them step in our countrys is disgusting. They have never did anything for any of these countries they have sovereignty over. Just cost ever country outrageous amounts. Not my King not my monarchy.  My King is the King of Kings, Lord of Lords He is the Christ, Messiah, God come to earth in the flesh. His name is Jesus Christ,  He is the Truth, the Way and the Life and NO man cometh to the Father except thru the Lord Jesus Christ. Repent , Recieve Christ into your heart and be saved.
you love yourself    no reading of your book
Rubbish!!
I have never believed in royalty evil family there wealthy but never share they do nothing for England and I don't see the point in them being there, share there wealth around the English population and make everyone rich. 🤣🤣
Jesus is king of kings, our ONLY salvation.   No other religion provides a savior.  Jesus wants a relationship with us, this is why he created us.  The Lord is now allowing the enemy to attack them because we live in the end season.   Jesus does NOT give people cancer, however satan does if you have open doors to the enemy.  Seek Jesus, he is the ONLY way.
Well said.  The BRF are grifters.  They represent themselves and the Peerage members who own one third of all the land in the UK.  TY for having the courage to tell the truth about who they are.
Sounds like the government and the Royals are Grimy tax Dodgers
100 % correct
❤❤❤❤
Its quite interesting a once  king Charles was brought to his knees by Cromwell. And here we are with another Charles boy king. His golden body armour Princees Diana and Elizabeth II both now gone. I dont fore see much good in his or Camillas future. I understand they no longer hold a hunting lease in nearby Scotland. That had to be quite the reality check.
Wow
He's not the real king of England... A cult!!
The Royal Family need to get proper jobs just like Prince Harry... Err... 😂
Yeah, so where's the Magna Carta Now?  It's the whole point. Not applied!!!
Noone like him ,what about DI 😢
And, as an aside, I hope that Kangaroo court is forced to free Assange ❤
What is your actual agenda though? Are you a communist?  Don't use this minor issue to undermine a whole system.
Clean and wash your dirty laundry. 👎🤮
For people to worship a king or a queen must have very low self-worth. They may think they’re divine if that’s the case they’re just delusional from the time I was 12 I hated royalty I did have a prior life I have a feeling I fought in the French revolution, I always think about those little baskets
I  was in the milatery for a long time.  My pension is only 220 a month. I have parchiol leg gone. PTSD.
Fantastic stuff WELL DONE MATE
I'll think you'll find, mate, that "exposing" someone means showing their cock and balls to the world.
HE’S NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE. THE MONARCHY IS FINISHED!
I think Queen Elizabeth stayed alive and most importantly in power as long as possible so King Charles will have a very short reign to make room for the new generation.
I agree with every word you say
I’m sure it means nothing- but that bit in the coronation where he says he is the sovereign of all the beasts and lands of the earth…. Just hyperbolic, right???
If the monachy is dissolved ....how would the Brits determine what property/lands belong TO THEM and what belongs to The EX-ROYALs.    The jewels/ all the castles, all the land, all the money - how to divide that up? I think the royals should get nothing.  Just put them on the street.  They have lots of money squirrelled away overseas - let them live on that.
Museums keep the staff to maintain all the lands farms and homes

Stop with this instigating nonsense.

Excellent.
Robin Hood wasn't really 'robbing the rich to give to the poor', he was returning the undue tax burden, stolen by government to the ordinary people it was stolen from...which is much more beautiful than a handout
Why are they even in power? It seems to me they're an old symbol of a system  that is not useful anymore.
And they stole the monarchy.  The windsors are germans!
Laws for ME, THEE and rf
You are not telling me anything I don’t know 😂😂😂
There are those in Parliament who need to be exposed like this who are associated with Terrorist in Ireland and those who knew all about the Grooming gangs that were active around the country one MP stood up in Parliament to reveal the likes of paedophiles and the Government and the Police around the country swept it under the carpet and muzzled the MP who spoke out it really makes you wonder today where the hell the fighting spirit that the British had because they sure as hell have no backbone today
Michel fkrom @Australia is the right King.
The original British were who you now call Black peoples… Moors!!! Hell… Europe is named after a Nubian Princess called Europa… look it up… google it… All the original Greeks and Romans were originally Moors/Muurs… Even the Germans… The Russians… All Moors… Even the American Indian the so called black peoples in the hoods of America are the original indigenous  natives of the Americas… look up Tartaria…
There just actors playing there part out on a staged world
You are scum God save the king
LOVE THIS GUY...LOL
I think it's time to ablolish the monarchy my honest opinion.
I love this channel!
All revolutions were funded. Whilst I abhor the monarchy, the bigger problem of England is City Of London
A man after my own heart. I have had dogs abuse for saying some of these things on social media. Psycophonts go mad. Just don't get how people can be so blind
Americans President, Is Presedent, Of A British CORPORATION, CALLED AMERICA.! However, DECADES AGO, THE QUEEN SIGNED OVER TO THE VATICAN, EVERYTHING BRITAIN OWNED BOTH FOREIGN, &, DOMESTIC, AS LONG AS THE BRITISH ROYAL REMAINED THE ADMINISTRATORS, OF THE VATICAN CORPORATION.! That's Why The, GOVT, &, Police/Policy Officers, Are Useless.! They Don't Work For You, They Work For, The Vatican Corporation.! WAKEY, WAKEY. 😮😂😅
Your language shows your spiteful soul. Theres no difference, if you think about it. Just wait till Obamas woke pawn rulesmtpu completely. You speak as if its alright to have  Muslim London Mayor, who is crushing you, one at a time. Maybe people like you, deserve it Wokism suppression. If you think Politicians are Angels and are better,then maybe move to Woke USA
Love that Cold Play made the cut❤

Look around the world, every hot spot and conflict area, exploitation. Almost every one traces to the British Crown. Even what people see as American traces to the crown. They sent Bolsheviks to kill the Russian monarchy and destroy Russia, sent saboteurs to France to kill their monarchy, foster Hitler to subdue Europe and attack Russia again. Enslaved and exploited India. Radicalized people to become Zionists and occupy an outpost called Israel while murdering Palestinians.  Britain succeeded to corrupt and undermine America significantly by the early 1900s. We’ve been fighting British wars and  establishing British empire goal of world empire since then.
ANARCHY IS BULLSH*T
My friend, I totally agree with your videos but I'm from Turkey and we don't have a monarchy and yet society is rife with inequality.. Similar to the UK societal problems, in Turkey the public struggle to make ends meet, while the gvt in power spits out havyar bcoz the eggs are too old. Inequality is not a phenomenon unique to UK but I do agree that it is sickening to see a bunch of white thugs be carried by black slaves!! Why? Bcoz the white thug was able to steal the black man's assets! No wonder the West supports Israel in the current genocide.
You are disgusting 0:46
I was sickened by the way Charles rubbed his wet nose with his gloved hand. Ugh
More people should see this video. Assure wake-up call
Well said ... They own land & sea ? They are betrayers 💖🇬🇧✝️
Stolen valour
I never gave two craps about the royals,just humans like the rest of us, only filthy rich and privileged
What is the name of the movie which scenes are shown? Greetz from Germany  One is Robin Hood, but I would like to know the older one...
He's YOUR king. You lot swear to be good little loyal puppy dog monarchists.
As a Kiwi, i have no respect for the king or royalty at all. I love the UK, having lived there for a couple of years in the late 70's. I don't believe any human is superior to anyone else. We are all equal. The royals suck off the people. They're largely a criminal group, aligned with the WEF, UN, and WHO and the so called elites that run those organisations, and the banks. They're all corrupt and should be tried in Nuremberg, and dealt with accordingly
What's the real job that monarchs do? Or they just rule.?
Symbology will be their downfall
chuck farls.... the best pic of chas was old Peckerwood poking Charles on the chest like he's the Rothschilds bitch....so TRUE !!!
I'm Ca,. but ethnically English....both sides.... the Windsors are a bastard line.... the real King is living in Australia, family, job, real straight up dude.... my kind of king !!
oliver cromwell
Are you not scared to talk about them like this knowing how they are  they maybe will put you in trouble  even if is true
Try living somewhere like the US for a change, where politicians run amok. As a Canadian, I am more than grateful to live in a constitutional Monarchy. It really is better than any other models because you can appeal to the Crown if a government goes rogue... See American politics!  You're probably someone who thinks that politicians have your best interests at heart, NOT. Nor will the sale of Monarchist property make you personally better off, It will be eaten by the State as soon as they can get their hands on it.  I really don't see how divesting yourselves of the Crown would help in any conceivable way. But Keep your Dreams, I just hope for your sake they are never fulfilled.
The Royals are such a load of Monarchs,I don't mean that in fine good way😡 God save The King You look like a Moron😊
Bringing Monarchy down will not resolve poverty and inequality.  Love them or loath them your problems are created by your politicians not by your Royals.
I stopped giving a damn after I learned about saville
👁️👁️
Definitely they are a very dangerous cult .
The royals don't love their women.
Im neither pro or anti royal but i did realise many years ago that if the royals were all kicked into the channel not one iota of my life would improve. I doubt the average bloke would have a spare penny more. But hey spew out yr vitriol :)
Sorry mate, the monarchy is the least of Britain's problems. Show me one political revolution that didn't descend into controlled and uncontrolled anarchy with the replacement of one tyranny with an equally or worse one.
Charles could not marry the frump while the mother of the future monarch was alive. Murdered for personal gain as with everything the royals have
The reason the French abolished their monarchy was because they still had an absolute monarchy. More than 100 years before that we had already fought a civil war which resulted in a parliamentary constitutional monarchy. Learn your history.  Anyway, the most civlised and developed countries by almost all indicators are countries which have monarchs; norway, denmark, sweden, netherlands, new zealand, australia
Thank you for sharing. 💞🌟🕊🌺💯
Your pathetic
The biggest con of all. £100 mil ?. Who got it, and what did they do for it?..and where is the money now??? All the infrastructure is always there.
Keep the Royal and get rid of this corrupt government.
If these costings were ever itemized I think we’d find a huge amount was down to policing costs, and not just the overtime payments but their normal daily salaries, so the daily wage would have been payed regardless and combined with their o/time a good percentage recouped in tax.  But for the drama AND to stoke hatred for the Royals, ( always a diversion from real problems ), I do admit have some 'questionable' members, a gross number is thrown to the pack, or herd, or whatever we are and as sheep we take the bait.  Like when millions of our brainless brethren saw a bus with £350 MILLION a week for the NHS written on its side, AND BELIEVED IT🙄  The 'enemy within' for Britain isn’t the Royals, our enemy is and always has been our shit, self-serving rubbish governments.  That’s where your money goes😤
Think your nasty
Finally a soldier knows the royal family are dirt
The Monarchy is corrupt. Mafia style.
France too would be "a bunch of bumbling peasants" if it wasn't for their sick and unrelenting oppression of West African countries. Don't praise them; they haven't earned it.
It’s about time !
God Bless! GODSPEED!
They changed their name right before WW2. Who does that?
"A family of inbred morons". Lol.
ENGLAND💩 AT THE CAUSE OF MOST UNITED STATES PROBLEMS
Anyone who wants to equalise people does not understand that it is impossible - we are all different and everyone has their unique strenghts and weaknessess, so even if we all get equal opportunities it will not result in equally good outcomes.  Equal opportunity is impossible dream if the social systems (education, health, justice, employment...) which facilitate those opportunities are corrupt and ineffective.
The trouble with telling them to get a job is they are not trained for or capable of doing anything meaningful.
Rubbish
isn't the royal family german not british at lest that's what i herd
There is a factual mistake at the beginning. Queen Elizabeth changed policy and RF members began paying taxes, all of them. It does no good for your argument when you begin with a lie. What else are you lying about.?
This BRF should GO AWAY, FAR, FAR AWAY! 🤮
OMG.  Maybe Queen consort Camilla turns to be respectful?
this man speaks da truth, liston to him.
I love the Royal family especially King Charles, Prince William, princes Katherine and their 3 children.  They are targeted by people who are full of hatred, bitterness and jealousy. Princess Anne leaves the majority of people miles behind with her work ethic.   God bless and protect the good people of the royal family but the hangers on who live off the name need to go.
Just shows how jealous someone can be. Looks like someone is envious of not being born a Royal.
What a bunch of sheep jumping on the bandwagon.  None of you could  stand the Royal life style for a minute I'd like to see you try.   Did a republic last more than a year in this country? Why did they try to make Cromwell a king.
Jealousy will get you no where. Bitter soul.  You gave no idea what your talking about.
I agree Charles was bad choice he should have stood aside for William and Kate . William served in forces Kate would make a great Queen due to her understanding of public's needs . He's totally wrong about them freeloading on taxpayers as they pay more in than take out . But agree some family should be made to get job
Very well argued though I will say this in favour of King Charles and Camilla: on his very infrequent visits to the UK, his Holiness the Dalai lama is always kindly received by them both IN PUBLIC, something that absolutely ENRAGES the Chinese😂
I’m Canadian and I couldn’t agree more!!✊🇨🇦
They are being dismantled as we watch. A corrupted bunch of creatures. They are not English, they are a German bloodline, not necessarily human, and nothing is clear at all.
Why is he former?
❤❤❤❤thanks
The Queen's hands were stained full of innocent blood, they did in South Africa, what the Nazi's did to the Jews in the second world war as far as concentration camps were concerned.
GO DEEPER, or HIGHER, as the case may be.
emmigrate asshole
It seems like all the weird people over the centuries have come from Germany, they still are coming, for example Klaus swabb. He is jacsinda aderns mentor, that's why we had such a horrible time while she was in power, she albut ruined NZ. So glad she's gone, but she left a ton of baggage for Chris Hipkins to pick up right before the election, it's no wonder people didn't vote labour again. He is nothing like her!!! She has left the country, I hope she stays gone.
They are just parasites living off the poor, what miserable creatures!! Imagine what life would be like to have the tax money in your pay I stead of them taking it to keep them and their inborn offspring for stupid costumes, fancy food, palaces, alcohol etc, they wouldn't know what a proper job feels like. They can't even dress themselves. I'm pleased that people are waking up to the facts. It shows the gap between rich and poor, it's about time the tables were turned. Thanks for your video. 🌻
The Monarchy elevates itself to a godly state with a better than thou attitude and live off the public like a type of welfare program.  If interested a book named "The Antichrist and a Cup of Tea" by Tim Cohen is very interesting, he was also interviewed by Janie DuVall on YT  Also another man Craig Bong came to the same conclusion and was interviewed by Janie DuVall.  The two men did not know each other and both have researched the topic for decades.
They are disgusting and evil
Princess Anne is the ONLY true working royal. I say QUEEN ANNE!!!!
Who gives a shit
"Inbred mor0ns" is exactly right. I've been calling them that for decades.
So……..NO PROOF OF ANYTHING ,…..AS USUAL
The British royal family plays an important role in safeguarding the British democratic system. I believe that as long as there are good operational traditions and methods, a democratic government under a constitutional monarchy will be more stable than a republican democratic government.
I’m no royalist  But I loathe socialism
They are actually of German decent. They changed their name to Windsor because of the War because they didn't want to be associated with Hitler.
I remember reading about Charles shaking hands with Robert Mugabe at the funeral of the late Pope John Paul II. What on earth was he thinking? Here is a man who is an unelected head of state, who spends billions of taxpayers money on himself and his family and he and his friends go out into the countryside killing the wildlife and terrorising people. If you ask me robert Mugabe ought to be far more careful in  future.
TRAITOR
Sounds like this mans got a real proplem. why did he leave the army ?was he thrown out ? There's always a mounting victim 😢😢😢😢😢😢 cry baby blarrrrrrrrrrrrrrr do me favour p/o mate looks like you were a crap soldier cry baby
"chubby little fingers" 😂🤣
We really don't need a royal family do we? Its all complete mind control. They probably laugh behind closed doors at the nations gullibility.
Princess Diana was murdered for embarrassing the  crown. So sad she really cared Bout the people. So charles could have his mistress and let her be  in the castle. Abomination.  People are starving what they throw in the garbage after a meal would feed many homelehss . They are kicked out of their homes cause they cannot afford  the taxes and the rent.GOD HELP THEM  ALL😢
👍
And I bet you love Islam.
WHAT IS IT THAT THEY DO  ?   NOTHING BUT COLLECT YOUR MONEY. IT'S JUST RIDICULES..THEY CALL US USELESS EATERS, WELL AT LEAST WE WORK !!!!!!!
Royals have nowhere in society in these modern times.
The reason cholesterol goes up when you have a stroke of heart attack is because your body produces more cholesterol at those times in order to protect your brain which is made up of a lot of cholesterol.
As an American, I am puzzled by this attitude toward the royals. In modern times, they do not appear to be doing any harm.
I love you you speak such a lot of sense
I remember a short clip where that freak "Charles" actually hisses at a servant (i assume) who was just offscreen because he had some weird issue with the pen he was using. Full on hissed like a snake. Vile wretch.
Factually the Royals DO pay tax on their income from their private fortune. It's the payment of expenses to maintain the fabric of the monarchy (called the Civil List) which is tax free. Obviously, it's a reimbursement of expenses not income.
British humor is by far the BEST....Semper Fi
What is WEF please?
: The name of the real King that by blood heritability should be sitting on the throne is MICHAEL the throne was stolen from him.  Also the Monarchs have to be crowned sitting on the Stone of Scone, The Lia Fáil, The Stone of Jacob (ect. many names)but the stone that is used is not the original, it does not have the weight.  Michael lives in Australia he works ...and he does'nt want  to know anything about being King ,he's happy as he is.   Someone once said Rothchild is Charles father ;that struck me ,now having studied them at nauseam ...i find the resemblance uncanny.  Someone else said that Charles would abdicate ,and Prince William if he became King ,he would become King William VI ...dissect the W=VV and re-arrange his name and title ;and look what we have... I -VI VI VI - I AM =  I THE BEAST GOD or ... I AM I THE BEAST   Three are prophesied as the UNHOLY TRINITY...the Beast, the Antichrist, and the false prophet.  😂😂😂🤷🏼‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Charles will never escape Diana's Ghost.
I wouldn't mind the royal family when they do what they are payed for. When the house of Saud says something the people obey but title without power is a waste. When your going to call yourself a king behave like a king not a shoeshine boy of another country
As an American i have never cared for the Monarchy i have always known how Crupt they are just like my countries Government and it's Politician's.
No man is above any other human and should not worship another. Worship yourself and no deity either.
Good one. Thank you!
Second thought: Charles has serious edema, that's why his fingers look more like sausages. May the edema take him to meet his maker quite soon!
I am very impressed with Joe Glenton, but he should see the meat puppets on ABC television in the United States drowning themselves in their own slobber whenever the royals are mentioned. They must have watched too many episodes of Downton Abbey, programming designed to train us to return to our "natural" serfdom. But they know, of course, that THEY will be part of the aristocracy, hahaha. Many thanks, Joe, for a great post!
king charles doesnt speak up for us. his ultra green ideas are killing us as a country
The King seems to have a soft spot for countries that have no problems with Slavery Child Sex Subjugation of women.  Just saying.
Wonder if the Queen sold all the Land she Owned in Denver before she passed?  Apparently she owns more of Denver than there is Denver?  Is there truth to this?
We need to make sure when we get rid of the monarchy that we don't replace it with what they've got in the states and France, i.e. an elected king otherwise known as a president.  This isn't democracy when you have such a limited choice on who you're allowed to vote for.
There's a plaque to Wat Tyler and the tens of thousands of peasants who gathered on Blackheath, southeast London to protest against the regime in 1341.
It's worth knowing the history of Wat Tyler, who led a march to demand freedoms from king Richard Ii in 1341, at a time when Britain was feudal. He was brutally murdered by the king's henchmen, which unfortunately ended the uprising. Link to read:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Tyler  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Tyler
Been looking for this video for months. Thanks Joe 👍🏽 God Bless ❤️ 🙌
I definitely don’t think things would be better without the royals as there will always be someone eager to play Napoleon. However, I am not supportive of Charles and his siblings, I did not watch the coronation, I don’t get those stupid medals and pomp and look at the mess that is the Sussexes. I agree with a lot you say and It’s depressing.
What an articulate Man who speaks the truth, very very clearly. It’s really not all that complex actually. We’ve been fighting inequality  since the caveman days when they used to smack each other on the head with a mammoth bone.
My brother did anyone notice that the stone of destiny was missing under the coronation chair ? I suspect that the coronation was actually invalid from what I can tell yeah🐸
I thought that when they go abroad they bring money in? But some of the  people Lord's and Lady's can be RACIST.
There are no snakes in England except for King Charles!
It amazes me how annother video post on a social platform still has people falling for its content and knee jerking replies. Its mainly based on history & moving power. thats been happening since the evolution of man.
That little king George is gonna shit himself when he realises being Royal is not reduced to be   No, one wants to suck up to the Royals"
They are a cartel nothing more
And every time they visit Canada the Canadian taxpayers foot the bill.
British royal family, the Vatican, Washington square mile make up the triad of world control including the banking system. The international bank of reconciliation is owned by these twisted tyrants. Not enough people bother to research and exercise due diligence.
Is the monarchy your last stand.you country has been handed over to Arabs and other  Islamic invaders.
Servands of rohtshilds ... UK is a kingdom and not a nation! That's maen, the king selecting the best cows in her kingdom farm! This is why the UK is overhand to moslems and Asians then they make more babys, so more tax .. the king have no interest more to the native United Kingdom citizens.. this is not a big trouble if Asians or afgans rapping UK native citizens..
Damn yeah bro, only just got privileged your channel thanks to yt algorithm, you talk too much sense my friend! 👍🇭🇲
They also beknigt the zionist Jews and supposedly enoble the oldest organized crime against humanity...Do you really think Rothschilds and Lord Sugar are English, Scott, Welsh or Irish?
Oh dear.. go away please. You get a proper job.. Check your facts first..
As contradictory and discordant as it seems, as an American I've always had a soft spot for the Crown, both as an institution itself and the  thousand years of traditions, pomp & ceremony, etc. that it represents.  But I suppose my affinity for the monarchy was attributable to Queen Elizabeth who, having been born in the 1920s, personified the institution and its traditions.  The institution and its wonderfully archaic traditions just seemed "normal" with her on the throne.  You know, people older than the hills doing things the way they were done 100 years ago or more.  But King Charles, well he's a product of my own era (I think Ol' Jug Ears is about ten years older than I am).  To me, seeing him go around in his high-collar tunics, replete with outmoded accoutrements like sword, dirk, etc., festooned with ribbons and medals for battles he never fought, reminds me of a cartoon character out of some Disney production at best, or a flat-out poltroon at worst.  I mean, come on, when was the last time someone went into battler toting a four-foot long sword?  And when did the UK go to war with anyone, aside from Conservatives expressing a divergence of opinion on Covid or immigration policy, in the last 50 years?  Yeah, I'm kinda thinking its time to end it.  The monarchy is an antiquated relic from a bygone era decidedly out of sycnh and in stark contrast with contemporary times.
Here here bloody inbreeding royals ay
We see governments now. WHITEMANBAD is and ALWAYS was the basis of immigration. As one french president said wemustbreedeuropeanswithblacks...iftheyrefusewewillmakethem FUNNY HOW THEY NEVER LOOK IN THE MIRROR
Democracy is the tyranny of the mob. The largest minority wields absolute executive power over the rest. It is three wolves and a lamb voting on who is for dinner. It is at best 51% deciding what rights(privileges) the rest have. It is the most odious concept humanity has concocted. I for one would like to see it consigned to the dustbin of history.
My military service started the day Diana died, I woke up on the morning of my first day of training to her death all over the news, that was a game changer for me.
get over it chuck
If you knew what they really up to (were up to) you'd be very surprised.
Jesus is my lord .  I dont need the royals and there  tyranny

I am a Siri Lankan. What worries me even to this day about the "royal drama" is what the monarchy did to my country by invading it in the beginning of 19th century as part of their greed for colonialisation. Still we are suffering from the repercussions of it by losing our core values: true Buddha's teachings are lost since colonialists not only stole our ola-leaf writings to stuff their museums but also mislead Siri Lankans by transferring landmarks of Buddha's time to India. This was done by exercising heinous and cunning acts (mastermind is Alexander Cunningham - how appopriate his name is!). Also destroyed our prestigious cultural identity and introduced a disgraceful party politics, where to this day, there is nothing but chaos and destruction in the country since independence in 1948.
You don't offer an argument, you offer instead left wing rhetoric. "Put the Royals in Council houses" and make 'em sell chestnuts for a living. Really!
I disagree with an elected head off State I can’t recall a time when we had a good Primeminister ?? Who is really stealing all the money from our country?? Think about it …
❤❤❤
Wow, what a crazy video, I mean, the fake "king" usually exposes himself. Jimmy Savile, (or as he should be called: So Vile!) taught little chucky everything he knows, from how to salute the devil, to how to sacrifice children to him... and as a usurper to the throne, what else matters? He's got all his base bases covered, I guess, huh? These people are sick, and certainly NOT royalty, as one who knows what that actually is: a servant to the people, if one is a true noble...and not a bunch of megalomaniac psychopaths, as these serpent seed people are... The jig is up for these people. They're done.
How do the poor stand up to the rich.This will never change.
Dont forget the french révolution '' was not for the people but for an élite and the  previous monarchy was not the same one as the later british one ..
I am not their servant. I dont care if they say im bad i wont be indebted to them.
John Lydon said as it is: God save the Queen, the fascist regime.
Spot on my friend. Thank God that someone standing for the truth
Wouldn't worry much w. E. F. Has plans for the Windsors.
Wouldn't worry too much wef has plans for the Windsors.
Totally respect you for speaking the truth.  You definitely are brave to take on the Firm with their incredible power.
Of course the King isn't a gangster.  Anyone else would sue this man for defamation and win, but the royals don't sue.
I mostly agree with the video but the Sex Pistols weren't bottom-up. They were highly manufactured by rich music producers and named after a clothing store, for goodness' sake. People need to stop with this silly rock mythology about that worthless band. Rotten's "politics" are as shallow and vapid as any "queer radical trans cat" on tik tok today.
The issue at hand is that Britain and the United States have corrupt leadership that has opened the flood gates to the 3 rd world on purpose with the citizens in their crosshairs.  Globalism is a mental defect.
The masses still queue up to see this evil family, worship and love them; Stockholm Syndrome on a massive scale...it's mental. Andrew's not the only nonce in that family and let's not forget about the missing children in Kamloops, British Columbia. They're worse than any crime family or any mafia.

Charles had his beautiful wife murdered because she real and popular
Monarchy, government, any ruling entities is never for the people. It's always to rule, take ,brainwash , colonize ,steal ,control to maintain order and power. It's time people understand what really goes on with these rulers. They have never been for the people.Thats how this  world is.
British Monarchy from the get go has been nothing but a waste of people's money that bow to them n cherish them. How stupid, there is no need for that monarchy. Evil runs in their vains so pathetic this world is. Thanx for exposing these useless people amongst many satanists there in the illuminati incl other secret societies
They changed their name to Windsor because they thought they would not be accepted with the German sir name they had!  The biggest benefit cheats in the world! The royal family, they put their money in a foreign country which is illegal!
Elizabeth was the last of the Royals who actually had compassion for humanity. Charles is in league with / if not The Antichrist.
Omg there's a  bloody bigger gangster behide the the fucking royals they are a BIG DISTRACTION FOR US ALL ...I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE THEM WOULD U FFS WAKE  UP WILL U FIND THE REAL CONTROL FREAKS OFF THE THIS FUCKING WORLD WILL U
European Black Nobility Mafioso
cromwell was a tyrant because he was dealing with a corrupt king, corrupt lords and a corrupt parliament. he gave them every chance to reform even leaving politics for 2 years to allow them to do so, but there nature was irredeemable and force was all they feared. In ireland he took off the velvet glove and pummelled them into submission the only person ever to do so, even today they speak of him with fear and dread.
The UK is a common law jurisdiction. Under common law, Charlie boy is a fraudster. 'Royal Assent' was given to the public order act 2023 on 2/5/23.  The act states "Be it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty ......" Charles was not sworn in as king until 6/5/23  - 4 days later, therefore, under common law, he committed FRAUD by Deception. There is a legal maxim going back centuries along the lines of "that which begins in fraud, remains in fraud". When was this fraudulent P.O.A 2023 first used ?  To arrest potential protesters at the fraudsters coronation.  How very convenient.
all your talks are in my mind is very true,but the hordes love them seemingly.
They should give all the money what british tax payers payed back to british public.put them in counsil flat live on £700go to 9-5jobs."You WILL HAVE NOTHING AND BE HAPPY"LETS SEE IF SUNAK AND THESE WOULD LOOSE EVERYTHING WOULD THEY B HAPPY??????MORE REAL MAN....
The Royal Family are not the only problem.  Even if you eliminated the royal family the UK and the US are controlled by an oligarchy, so the royal family are only part of the ruling class.  What is wrong with the members of Parliament demanding higher taxes from the wealthy class in order to provide for NHS, affordable housing, and affordable transportation, along with opportunities for upward mobility. The House of Commons is part of the problem.
He's not my king.   The only King is our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. He said, "I am the way the truth and the life no 1 comes to the father except through me." HEAVEN and HELL is real REPENT and believe in our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. ETERNITY is a long, long time in HELL. It's not about religion. It's about putting your trust in JESUS.  Read the BIBLE, the Gosple means "good news." Reading the Gospel of John first. 🙏 🙏
Malignant narcisist Amd the william guy is the same but in a covert mode yey.. This people are all a big old fat gross lie.. undortunatelity others suffer the qonvequences of their existence.. This charles thing wears medals on his chest and he dont even had a figjt in a pub.. I dont know who is the bigger joke the royals of the ass or their flying monkeys..
I agree with you.
If youre rational,you cant approve of royalty. But at least Elizabeth had massive discipline and elegance .Never in my life did she lose control in front of the camera.Charles did when his pen leaked on his first day.As for the western masses,theyre no more than trained doggies with stockholm syndrome.
Black Adder did a great job mocking ! The good old days
The royal family, a version of Truman show brought to you by anonymous handlers
Agree so much. King Joe Biden. We have our own royality.   Kings of the earth.
YOUR AWESOME!   AGREE!!!!!
Great information thank you
Princess Catherine hasn’t been seen in public since Dec 25th 2023. She screams for her medical privacy, not sharing with the public who actually pay her & support her lifestyle! She lives off taxpayers money yet no one can get an honest answer as to where the hell she is. Seemingly she had a STROKE & is under going physical rehabilitation. So millions in taxpayers funds and overnight she dropped out of the Royal circle, without any warning 🤔
Good job. It's weird we still do this in 2024.
“Inbred morons” 😂 I’ve never watched this channel but so glad you popped up in my YT suggestions today I will be watching some more - great stuff you have improved my day no end (love the Monty Python & Pistols clips) thank you 👏🏻
Somebody has to do the job as head of state.  There’s no doubt they cost too much. It is extraordinary that the royals are proud to have medals that they never fought for.
The time is coming when Australia will ditch the monarchy and become a republic
A few ear ago , when QE ll , was healthy , about how they have aquired their wealth , and most of the land on earth -  the british commonwealth of countrys  -  the colonys .   HM , as not amue , even though i was most polite . Her dispeasure , was returned to its crator , with blessings  .
royals are zionist reptilians from Germany
Quanti ancora nutrono ammirazione verso questa monarchia che si muove sempre nell ombra e condiziona la politica sacrificando altri popoli e i propi soldati per i venali loro interessi
No one is "Royal" - your just forced to go along with it  - the Americans got it right.
The king has one job!! To select the right people for the House of Lords!! The House of Lords is supposed to moderate the commons for England s best investment.   So we the people demand the king do his job and only allow people who have 100% of their assets in England!!   The queen screwed this up and most have more assets outside the uk !! Not even England!!   And that is why they are more interested in foreign affairs than you and me!!  We the people demand the king do his job. His only job. Make the House of Lords for England!!
Hybride poeple not from this globe.
I like the French model....chop.
The French are getting submerged in islam ,and masse immigration. .Its no Eldorado believe me
Well said !
Despise all rich who allow the people who pay them ... Live in sickness, inequality, squalor...
Always despised carmile and charles for whatthey did to Di
Harrys also a traitor to the Crown….. but benefits from being born into that family 🙄
Now we know why they killed princes Diana, thank you for proving what I was saying to the English so many time, research your history and stop expecting to be told your history, know your past don't expect to be reached of your past ... Thank you .
MY GOD HELP US ALL!! THEY'RE LEACHES WALFERE RECIPIENTS.. THERE'S NOTHING ELSE THEY CONTRIBUTE IN THIS WORLD!!
I don’t agree doctors and nurses are paid a pittance. They’re paid quite well.
Jugears' coronation cost £100,000,000.00, Lizzie's funeral cost approx. £10,000,000.00, William's coronation another £100,000,000.00 & when it comes Charlie boy's funeral another £10,000,000.00, So in just over a year or two the taxpayer has/will pay out £220,000,000.00! That money should have been used to fund the NHS, nurse's & teacher's pay, & decent funding for the disabled & pensioners. William should offer to pay for his own coronation & specify that the cost the taxpayer would have paid out is to go to the disabled, pensioners & the NHS, as he can easily afford it. That would go a long way to garner a positive image
The French thing - that's when I realised this was a parody.
Which leaders are not gangsters?
Funny that you highlight renegade artists, many of them have become a part of the establishment. American musicians and actors (w/ a few exceptions) have joined ranks with left leftist administrations. I’ve come to the place that both political parties are just two sides of the same coin. The Trump & Q cult is beyond me. I don’t trust any of them.
New Subscriber here😊 Just Love these TRUTHS U blatantly layout!!! Kudos to U for saying IT like IT IS!!❤
Before you open your mouth ,do you realise how much money, tourism , and investments they bring into the UK, I don't think you do , billions,to be honest  I don't think the royals get enough money.
Not to mention they are satanists!
Shower of bastards the lot of them.
They are not for me😂
What change my mind on the monarchy was finding out …King Charles secretly profiting from the assets of dead citizens. The king is profiting from the deaths of thousands of people in the north-west of England whose assets are secretly being used to upgrade a commercial property empire managed by his hereditary estate
The "Levellers" were j ew lovers who place the Lion of Judah on their flags and banners.
Fabulous video. Keep going.
Charles.His no king.We should get rid of royalty.Why should there have a Lovely life.When other people are suffering.Or trying to get by.
Changing the name to Windsor did change the attitude inot more pro English? Or made them more self interest... If every resident of UK pays let's say £2 towards the king how come they keep up so much wealth staff, clothing  travel ect? Does he has some interest in black fields of ukraine?
I have a lot of respect for the british common man, I live in Belgium and I was feeling extremely bad at the level of contrast between the royal family, and the living conditions in england that reveals how little the government cares about the basic wellbeing of humans there. All being functional to serve the money machine. The small housing, is sad,  and many other things, that I one that is morally sane in that position. cannot not wish upon you or anyone else  The british royalty, got rich by working together with the rotschschilds, that are the worst existential scum on any moral scale.
Scotland... FREEDOM!
I believe all "Monarchs" have Sold their Peoples and Countries to the W E F Bankers for a long time already 😢 Shame on them Shame Shame Shame
I did think  he could have done that.
Such a load tosh! You said you are an author? What do you write? Fairytales? By all means be critical but do it with a degree of intellectual perspective rather than a radical left wing communist perspective!
I think you're way out of line. The rules do a lot of good for the UK.
I served in the Royal Navy. In September 1972, HRH The Prince of Wales jlined our ship, HMS Minerva during our preparation for deployment as Guard Shkp to the West Indies. Much lkke you I was an ill informed anti rich people. I can tell you first hand what he isike. As  Sub lieutenant, Deputy  Gunnery Officer, he went down every Mess and spent an evening with us nunior rates. I was a Stoker and we had a reputation for being rowdy. He answered all our questions honestly and openly. He not only   listened to our gripes but acted on the legitimate ones. He had sympathy and understanding and also a very strong backbone. He was by far one, if not the best lfficers on the ship. He organised a Banyan, a beach BBQ on a deserterted Island or beach where we could let lur hair down. He showed he try is a man of the people. He would often be found ashofe with the junior rates. Those who served him still receive Christmas cards 50 years later. Princes Ann had over 3,000  appointments last year. The King has ablut the same. His name carries a lot of weigbt wben he raises funds for the numerous charities he is involved with, many of which afe for young people and to address poverty. Now, when London has been given over to the muslims and is full of extremists.  When illegal i.migrants are destroying the country and draining us dfy, instead of addressing the real problems and thfeats we face, you try to gdt us to turn inwards and destroy ourselves instead of addfessing the real threat to this cojngry. Long live the King.
Spot on and mkre people should become vociferous for justice.
The classic argument is "they bring tourism and therefore revenue through tourism to the country " , so it's all worth it, true or false? France and Italy  still apparently has tourism without royalty although Rome has the pope and that's another topic.
The reason the British people tolerate Charles as king is because they want William, Diana's son, to next sit on the throne.
Go and earn some honest money with a real instead of grifting off people with this UTube scam. Or should I say scum ?
The Exploited weren't afraid to call the powers that be bullshit
I admire your courage. I wouldn't want the so-called royal family pissed at me. Id rather have the Gambino family after me. Watched your six brother
Paul Kidd, Jimmy Savile, Rolfe Harris, Stewart Hall, And Jeff Epstien. Just a few of the Royal Family's friends. Either the royal protection service constantly fails in its role..............Or the Royals really like Peado's.
I urge everyone to watch this video called “  Former British  Soldier  Exposes King Charles “ The truth can be hard to see but it needs to be seen
Harry is doing a fantastic job of turning people against the monarchy! It's all bollocks!  It's the old Pagan belief system that God pre-determines a person's social standing from birth!  A bit like a chessboard! 😊
It's good pointing the finger, but be honest MP's across all party's, are in the same field, the peasant people are forgotten, or to the point stamped on, you should give a overall view rather a targeted view, from my personal point of view, as personally I think the Queen to King, brings more to the country but still not a fan.
Mistress as queen 😂😢😅
This kid is for real
I will never call this clown king! They are a bunch of corrupt bastards. I always called them a bunch of German tourist, they are nothing to me.
When people lived in Caves, the ones who evolved mentally, soon realized that if they surrounded themselves with strong animalistic  hungry thugs. Then give them all the food they could eat, these THUGS, would kill for them! No different today, keep the WARS going and we all pay for their SICK ideas, which is called: "Inflation". As long as we have stupid people who Vote for politicians, which only encourages  them. And Royalists, what hope do we have????👺👹, that is why the Earth is being ruined.  and we pay
He has delusions of grandeur which is fatal in his privileged position
As an Australian, I found it impossible to understand the money "Charlie Chuckles" (this is the clean version) spent on his coronation. The sooner Australia becomes independant of the monarchy, the better. Charlie, for me, is as genuine as a 3 quid note. What he did to Diana is unforgivable.
#NOTMYKING!  #SUPPORTWHISTLEBLOWERS #FREEDOMOFSPEECH #ENDCENSORSHIP
Presidency ? To many Woke nowadays, if the first one elected is not of Eastern promise, the second one will be !  It seems the country is infested with parasites.
We never did find out who the naked person was escaping out of the window at FuckingHim Palace.
Amazes me how people sit there listening to the radio watching TV news and believe what their being told. I no longer watch TV or listen to the radio I cant makes me angry with the lies and watching the royals on TV well  I have no words that would be alowed on here
They are an embarassment to humanity, the only reason they exist is because people support them, why they do that? Submissively, people need to wake up🐥
I KNOW THAT THEY ARE SOULESS MONSTERS.
So very true
The most successful parasite in nature makes itself indispensable to its host. These creatures are leeches. Loathed the monarchy my whole life.
I love this guy 😂
Rome's new breed England daughter America grandson prime minister countries grate grandchildren are romes army the French a moving wall around rome.
Oh, don't forget about King Chucky's heavy-handed influence over the Common Wealth countries.  All his goals from the 1970s are rolling out worldwide through the UN, WEF, etc.  In all the world he is the largest landowner.  That's the basis for his global socio-political reach.
There’s 1 Royal only and that’s Jesus everything else is inverted truth
Your so tight they murdered princess Diana and got a way with murder they call Kamila queen 😂
Someone that doesn't like what's going on making complaints.
None so blind as  them who refuse to see
We, the Americans, don't shut up about our revolution because we got rid of a king!
Its not some secret club, theres a Build-a-Bear in every mall in America.
Yeah, the "French model" is looking tempting all around the world these days. Trouble is, we've tried that repeatedly. Trouble is, a revolution just spins things about until we're standing right in the same spot, only in a pool of blood.
Bloody lizard peoples.
We are not fighting against flesh and blood enemies, the kingdom is ruled by wicked and evil, a blood stained crown of the antichrist
Didn't Harry serve 2 tours in Iraq? Wasn't he a working pilot? Why was Charles & William - 2 people who never saw combat - allowed to strip Harry of his right to wear his uniform now? Vets in the USA can wear theirs as they choose.
Prayers for ending selective education and documentation of prejudices throughout the history of gangs manipulating never-ending artfulness of GAMES psychological psychopathic narcissistic manipulating abuses on many levels! Prayers for generations past, present, and future! Truthfulness is unwelcome in the circus of facades where perceptions can be many!
l live in Canada and we want no part of the Monarchy coming here, costing us millions to pay for them to wave while we pay for their lodgings, security, travel, meals, dragging ppl out to meet and greet with them.  There is no use for the Monarchy anymore.  We have Governments that run everything and from l see, most of them sit on their butts ringing bells to be served by slaves.  Anyone on Youtube, that says they are so excited to be working for the RF, cooking, cleaning, shining up the crystal must be royally nuts.  lt is bad  enough to clean one's own home, but to go and clean up after l imagine a bunch of slobs is not worth my time or pay.  l hear Charles has temper tantrums if his bath water is not the exact temprature, which makes him sound like more a spoiled child cry baby and to think Diana actually married him...Then Andrew with his 64 teddy bears that has to have them exactly in the same position everyday on his bed...Sorry, but in Canada those are not considered real men, but Whimps or Mama's boys....They treat their women terribly but so do the men here also, lol. Anyways, l liked your channel, so l joined, take care over the pond my friend, Michelle from Canada....PS  l have heard from some of you Brits that you think the Canadian accent is one / if not the worst English accent you have ever heard, lol
I was done with anything to do with the Royals when I saw them at the common wealth ceremonies where they were blowing down to a replica of a bull, pulled though the streets by Woman wth chains around their necks.. Praising the bull of bala.They aren't nice people.. Evil
Sooo, I'll trade you two Bidens for your king. Deal?
The thing you should worry most about is being taken over by those practitioners of the religion of peace. That’s when we say good bye GB, you had an awesome run.
My great and great grandfather went again king Henry 8th in a thing called the pilgrimage of grace there was 3 main people that raised over 20 thousand men , it was stopped and the main people were killed I think it was only sir ralph ellerker the king didn't kill he then became very high up in the army and was killed in france
My ex-husbands line goes clear back to Anne boleyn Cheney grandparent or parent. They all look like imbteads. This is the same line as Dick Cheney but they broke off.
I believe the "royals" are actually EVIL and Princess Diana knew! Everyone needs Jesus or they are doomed for eternity.  These people are fake religious entities who could have ended hunger world wide with their          money, if they were human beings with a ♥     Selfish
Its about fkin time these Tax dodging interbreeding Royals were abolished it would save British Tax payers hundreds of millions
Well now sausage fingers has cancer.
Well said mate.
Absolute rubbish who cares what some nobody says  You should be ashamed of yourself trying to make up up stories  Our royal family has survived for over a thousand years
The Royal Family is controlled by Government they really have no power except figure Head for Tourism
Youtuber EXPOSES Joe Glenton:  Joe Glenton is a left-wing antisemite who predictably works for the _Guardian._  He spent 5 minutes in the British Army, before deserting his comrades in Aghanistan and running away to Australia.  After being chucked out of the Army for desertion, he got a 2.1 from some crappy provincial polytechnic, and now pontificates about what's wrong with everyone else from Fleet Street while being distinctly coy about his own personal fortune. What a w*nker.
For me god save the queen William should of been king
Thank You!
We need to hold on to the royal family at all costs if we want any remnant of our beloved England to remain.
King Chuckie is 10-13% INBRED according to the Royalty’s Lineage.  That’s how the wealth keeps inherited money in the family. Explains why he looks, thinks and acts the way he is.   Even his beloved 304 Camila is related to King Chuckie.
Tampons is disgusting
fair point on monarchy , but you could equally say the same about the politicians in government. What next be anarchists? A lot of the compliants are projected on the royal when in fact a lot of culture is to blame. Who contributes to culture everyone of course so we are all guilty.
I never Did like him and even less when he was unfaithful to Diana, Then im convinced with the idea the royal family had something to do with her death , Add to that the amount of Pedophiles they had as guests and friends,  Add to that the total lack of knowledge and lack of feelings for the real British public...And they rule over a country thats going down the pan ,The ex British military are totally ignored, The sick, disabled and poor are totally forgotten while finding money for all the refugees and asylum seekers and making more laws to let them take over the uk and making the British people a second class citizens in there own country....
Hey dude I could not have put it better most of them are nonces
I'm American who lives in uk.  I'm aghast at people who blindly follow these people who had a loosely related relative who won a battle 1000 years ago. Why? How?  It's disgusting
Spot on.
Can you make a short video of the positive points of the British Royalty?
I take it he's not a fan of the Royal Family
Anyone who is really is open to looking  at the royal family I reccomend reading ' Our own dear Queen' by Piers Brendon.
The crowded at a recent boxing fight held in Liverpool actually booed the British anthem,right through
They killed Lady Di. Can you IMAGINE if she had married that cardiac surgeon? Hasmit Khan or something he was called .. Dodi was to make him jealous..   Can you imagine if she and khan had married? You’d have the future king being brought up by a Muslim .. an alternative royal family in a way .. and they would’ve been more popular too
At least they could pay taxes. Thank you.
Ty mate for this video wish didn’t join the army pal its all about money and control as you’ve realised
But when you signed up for the military you took an oath,did you not?..🇬🇧 "I swear that i will be faithful & bear true allegiance to Her Majesty,her heirs & successors & are duty bound to defend her,her heirs, crown and dignity" 👑
It was telling how during Covid the Royals were silent and did nothing. unusually silent actually. They did not help...because they don't want to.
Well said Sir👌👍
What is a FOOD BANK ?😮
The self described elites are parasites and thieves.
They are not gangsters. Unless by gangsters you mean weak clowns who can be easily overthrown and who make up shit as they go.
As the "royals" hoard the gold and think of themselves as gods they do not realize that one day they will stand before the living God and give an account of their wicked deeds and their oppression of the poor.
The Cream of UK will get its karma, at last.
Finally.  A Truth Teller.
Here Here! im glad i found you.God bless you🫂🕊️
I Love what you said, so True!❤❤
yes, but HOW?
You rock!  Could we please have some more?
It’s obscene the amount of money these parasites cost the taxpayer.
Defender of the faith!!! Just a very public adulterer and the very epitome of corporate greed.he keeps Andrew out of the picture,not for wrongdoing,but because he is bad for the brand.the sooner they are consigned to the dust bin of history the better
the guy is a loser just ask his son harry
Get rid of him.
They are part of the worldwide 1% elite rich!
100% everything said about the mafia Dons called royals ,is spot on way overdue to get rid of this criminal outdated gang of bandits
Right on!
Your so right. The royals are useless and do as little as possible for there people.   BTW I find you very sexy and love hearing you 😊
It would be interesting to know exactly who the most powerful families are in this world.  Some people say it is the Rothchilds.  I am not so sure about that.  As I see it the monarchy still has control of the US, which many people will argue the opposite.  These people need to dig deeper.  After the so-called revolution in the colonies, cerca 1776, the king ordered the colonies to pay war reparations,,,, and they did (well, they got a lot of debt that eventually caused the establishment of the corporation called the UNITED STATES of AMERICA in 1871).  Most courts in the US use "Admiralty law", not constitutional law.  Learn why there is a gold fringe around the US flag in most places.  Educate yourselves.  Look at the wars and who goes together, the US, UK, Canada, Australia.  Why?  The scummy pigs that live in Buggeringham palace are pleased for the US to be blamed for the nasty wars, this ensures they won't get their heads chopped off.  It is so simple, just blame the so-called president for everything.  All the so-called presidents in the US are puppets,,, to whom?
For me, when Charles was unfaithful to Diana was the end. What a wonderful example!
Now the British citizens are actually paying their 'King' to destroy Britain, their values, and their quality of life! lmfao! Does anyone in Britain even care that Charles is such a huge part of the WEF that he's the one who actually coined the term "The Great Reset"? And just one more question for you: Did you get your Council's permission to do this video in your free and democratic country? Or even get permission for how many sheets of TP you were allowed to use this morning? The fact that anyone in Britain believes they live in any form of democracy is fundamentally deranged. It's been a Monarchy from Day One, and you're still the serfs!
At this point in time, King Charles seems to be receiving some sort of repayment for his misdeeds. Did he have a hand in removing Princess Diana? Hmm...
Thanks for speaking out. I think Charlie and the rest of the gang should be abolished in 2024. The only good member of this family was Diana, and our boy Charlie probably knows what really happened to her!
This dude clearly has Daddy issues.....😂
I think it is sick that Charles wears all the stars and badges and ropes and medals and pins and stripes of a commander. It's mockery. He should be deposed. He is ridiculous.
Seeing that infamous photo of Chales being poked in the chest by Rothschild was enough for me.
Spot on mate.
You have no idea what you're talking about
Could not agree more
Name a better system where the real leaders aren't crooks.
Interpretations.
Bang on Brother
After Diana I thought they had the mafia on their payroll and their German history always put me about

If u was born in 1770’s…… it’s what they noticed in American colonies…  and they noped out of that! ❤ they are still doing same things all these years later.. same game different year..
Amen, Amen, Amen. Thus is all why my interest in *The Royals* ended in 1776.  Currently losing interest in all the rest of the governments...what a bloody scam!
Chas is lucky to be with us.   He nearly got whacked in Rhodesia when he visited there in 1980.
You need the help of Khorne to accomplish your dream
The biggest slave owners along with the Belgians slave shippers and America gets blamed for the end product of there slavery business!
Great to finally see this especially from a englishman !❤
Viewers watching this need to remember, there's retired & serving soldiers who'd totally disagree with this bloke..
The British Monarchy highlights & champions multitudes of charities around the world, & is the drawcard for tourism to the UK. They generate wealth for Your country! I don't understand your hatred of them?
Just another Harry that wants to bring down the throne
Anglo Saxons Vs Normans
I don’t like them, look at Andrew, if he was an ordinary guy, well I will say no more.
Sorry for the war a d piece size novel  In 1992, The Queen volunteered to pay income tax and capital gains tax on her personal income, and the King does the same.The two duchies are exempt from corporation tax, but the King and the Prince of Wales voluntarily pay income tax on the revenue they generate. However, the amount of tax they pay is not made public. They do not pay capital gains tax because they do not benefit personally from any increase in the duchies' assets. Members of the Royal Family pay tax on any income generated from privately-owned assets. King Charles does not have to pay inheritance tax on the money he received when Queen Elizabeth died, under the "sovereign to sovereign" exemption agreed in 1993 by then Prime Minister John Major. Some argue that the true cost of the Royal Family is much greater than the size of the Sovereign Grant. It does not cover their security arrangements, which are usually paid for by the Metropolitan Police, although the cost is not disclosed. In May, the Treasury confirmed that Queen Elizabeth II's funeral had cost the government an estimated £162m. It is not yet known what the King's Coronation cost, although unofficial estimates suggest it could be between £50m and £100m. Republic, an organisation which campaigns for an elected head of state, previously estimated that the total yearly cost of the monarchy - once security and other additional costs are factored in - is about £345m. It is impossible to provide a concrete figure for the scale of the Royal Family's contribution to the UK economy. Estimates vary considerably. The consultancy Brand Finance argues the cost of Royal Family is eclipsed by what it contributes by boosting tourism and trade. However, Republic questions the validity of its sums, and points out that many of the Royal Family's assets are the property of the state. the Sovereign Grant was worth £86.3m, the same as in 2021-2022. But repairs to Buckingham Palace - which is undergoing a 10-year £369m refurbishment plan - and the costs associated with King Charles succeeding Queen Elizabeth, plus higher-than-expected inflation, took total spending for the period to £107.5m, according to the Royal Household's annual financial report. That represents a 5% increase on the £102.4m spent the previous year. The shortfall, with spending greater than the Sovereign Grant, meant drawing £20.7m from reserves. The King and other working members of the Royal Family use the money to pay for expenses related to their official duties. The vast majority is spent on the upkeep of properties and staff costs. Members of the Royal Family carried out 2,700 engagements across the UK and abroad during the year. More than 95,000 guests attended 330 events at royal residences, including receptions, award investitures and garden parties. Buckingham Palace received more than 183,000 items  The Royal Family was previously funded through a fixed annual payment known as the Civil List. This was replaced by the Sovereign Grant in 2012. Profits of the Crown Estate - a property business owned by the monarch but run independently - go to the Treasury. The level of profit is used as a benchmark to calculate the funding given by the government to the Royal Family. The Crown Estate had assets worth £16.5bn in 2022: almost £8bn of properties in London, including Regent Street, as well as nearly half the land along the coast of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is not the King's private property - it merely belongs to the monarch for the duration of their reign. The King cannot sell its assets or keep any profits for himself. The Sovereign Grant had been worth 15% of the Crown Estate profits generated two years previously. In 2017 it was agreed that this would increase to 25% for 10 years to help pay for the Buckingham Palace repairs. After a review, the government announced the Sovereign Grant will be worth 12% of the Crown Estate's profits from next year. The decision follows a significant increase in profits from six new offshore wind farms on the Crown Estate, worth £1bn. In January, King Charles said he wanted the extra profits to be used for the "wider public good". Cutting the percentage will mean the total Sovereign Grant for 2024-25 will remain at £86.3m for the third consecutive year. However, if Crown Estate profits grow as predicted, even under the reduced formula, the amount given to the Royal Family would then increase substantially, to £124.8m in 2025-2026 and £126m in 2026-2027. The 12% figure is due to remain in place until the end of the 10-year Buckingham Palace restoration project in 2027.   The King also receives money from a private estate called the Duchy of Lancaster, which is passed down from monarch to monarch. It covers more than 18,000 hectares of land in areas such as Lancashire and Yorkshire, as well as property in central London. Worth £654m, it generates about £20m a year in profits. Whoever holds the title of Duke of Cornwall (currently Prince William) benefits from the Duchy of Cornwall. It mainly covers land in south-west England. Worth £1bn, it generated a net surplus of £24m in 2022-23. The King and Prince William receive the profits from the duchies personally, and can spend them as they wish. However, they are not entitled to any proceeds from the sale of any estate assets, which must be reinvested. The monarch also owns the royal palaces (which are not part of the Crown Estate) and part of the Royal Collection of art, but these do not generate income. Some palaces are looked after and funded by the Royal Family itself. Others - such as the Tower of London - are managed by Historic Royal Palaces, an independent charity. The Royal Collection is also run by a charity, the Royal Collection Trust, which reinvests income received from ticket sales and retail outlets. The King also privately owns properties such as Sandringham and Balmoral. In addition, some Royal Family members have private art, jewellery and stamp collections which they can sell or use to generate income as they wish.
Who paid for the Queens funeral? Ask the Brits. It was the people. Not 1 penny came out of the Windsors pockets. They only beg for money & party.  The British people would be so much richer if the Monarchy would go away.
Government means (to control the mind) in Latin.🤔😐😑
Politician equals parasite
Absolutely agree! 👏
What an idiot and full of misinformation
It’s treason. You swore alliegence to King and country. Now you attack the very hand which fed you.
There’s whispers of Marxism here, be careful. Imperialism sux too.
The Mockingbird Media reports non stop on the Royals .
British Royal Family German Blood and a Relation to Vlad the Impaler of Romania .
I’m an American & I understood you Brits had a fake Coronation, like we had a fake Inauguration!   Also, that Charles (& Camilla) had Diana wacked off & ol’ Chucky offed his mother, the late Queen.   I also believe that this guy, & everyone else, may get their wish. We may be looking at the end of the monarchy. Could take a year for all the lies & whatever needs to be exposed. Harry & Meghan are right now feeling what it’s like to be just regular folk. Kate grew up regular. But then what about William?
So he's a royal tosser 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Time for fake firm of colonialism to close shop and return stolen goods to all the people. Taxpayers too!! Grifting inbreds over and out.
"Traitor to the Crown"  Yess -My Main Man !
William the Last. I said it first.
I suppose that the sad truth about revolutions is that they are judged on the basis of their success rather than the goodness or otherwise of their intentions.
The British royal family have known historic connections to Nazis and serial pedophiles.  If that was simply a coincidence, it is a very unfortunate one!
What other country has a national anthem about the crown instead of the country
monarchy has no use for british . may be time to abolish this monarchy, why pay them for not working
Yes, get rid of the Royal Family so they can live like everyone else, and know how hard it is out there.
Charles is a gangster all right. A lizard in disguise. 🦎
There German losers
None of these people in these privileged positions will ever go willingly! They always have to be forcibly removed. History has proven that over and over. They love the adulation, and recognition, and the celebrity status is addictive, and their worshippers just keep feeding their egos. They are raised thinking that by the grace of god, they are better than everyone else, otherwise why would he have put them where they are? It's actually quite sick, and I do believe a lot of them are very mentally ill, maladjusted people. Being raised that way from birth, doesn't bode well for anyone's mind!
😂 gota admit the Queen looks like a horrible little gremlin looking down on everyone
IF THE QUEEN GIVES OUT MEDALS ... DID CHARLES GET EM FROM HIS MAM?.. for what galantry?
For me its the fact the country has been destroyed and ruined and is turning into a third world Islamic dump and the royals just sit there and do nothing??? If we do get rid of the monarchy we need to make sure we have a strong constitution to protect our new founded replublic as one thing that would concern me most would be our nation becoming a social democracy.
How can u trust a WEF puppet
Bet Charlie sweats.
I wonder why the Americans won't shut up about their revolution ......🤔 To be perfectly clear the love of ones own country does not equate to hate or distain for anothers . Simple pride for the peaple. The country does not mean the people agree with the GOVERNMENT. As the media says the US did this or says this, No its our elected MONARCHY and most days are equal or no better than the royals quite honestly.
Diana to quote Black Adder 🤔 Ah the one they buried in the Y shaped coffin.
so you think you’re better  and you made it to what level of leadership on the national army?  I just hear a blubbering ranter  who would probably be twice as tyrannical if given the chance to be monarch for 1 day, then the  toxicity he ascribes to others
Yeah artists all play the rebel card but secretly want to be knighted. Sell outs. 😒
Plus, the Royal's are Pedovore Satanist! Jimmy Savile, birds of a feather!
Joe  get over it concentrate on the real problems
I DO NOT CONSENT AND I WILL NOT COMPLY with this 😈🐂💩
It’s a huge con trick perpetrated by the government, media, etc. I’m a working class man in Sheffield, I’m 60 years old, I come from a large, hardworking family, all the young ones in this family would now be considered ‘professionals’ - teachers, nurses etc. No one I know ever talks about the royals; the births, deaths, marriages etc, no one is interested, I’ve never met anyone who watched/watches the queen/king’s speech on xmas day. Certainly no one, I know respects their authority or wisdom or influence, they are as irrelevant as characters in s soap opera.
They ain't gangsters they are the     FIRM                          Yeah that's right a family of fucking crooks
Just as long as you don't think Socialism is the answer.
Nice book plug. Subtle.
Amen brother amen !!!
Thank you for the raw truth, there are things that are not encouraged to be talked about.
I am anti royal,but this is bitter and boring😂
Thank you for speaking the truth about this group of useless people who show their faces for "the causes" but don't care about anything outside their properties and barely even their own families. Narcissistism at it's highes essence.
I agree with everything he says!!!!
Whoever the most powerful Zionists are, they’re the strongest atm.
The King is the UK head of state, but his powers are largely symbolic and ceremonial. He remains politically neutral.  However- Appointing a government - the leader of the party that wins a general election is usually called to Buckingham Palace, where they are invited to form a government. The King also formally dissolves Parliament before a general election     State Opening and the King's Speech - the King sets out the government's plans in a speech delivered from the throne in the House of Lords     Royal Assent - when a piece of legislation is passed through Parliament, it must be formally approved by the King in order to become law. The last time Royal Assent was refused was in 1708
The opening ceremony for their I think they were called the Good Will Games. Very demonic had a giant bull with women chained, devil looking. Just weird. Not what I want
I fully agree.
Germans
Richest welfare recipients in the world.
Listen to what Arizona wilder says about the royal family, disturbing
They should have to work a normal job.
Lol you did sum up British in one go fair due
Well said   !!!!
Lets see them have a DNA test to see how English they are
Never fear. Jesus has the royals number. Christ returns and is recognized formally as King of Kings. I will obey him over every man or nation. If Hebrew gemetria is correct my father (1269) is Prince of Wales. In his passing, I will return the land to Christ.
So nicely put.
The trouble with you Brits is you keep thinking of World War II and the useless Royal Family .... Wake up, stand and be counted!
The problem is the majority men and women of these land are uneducated, illiterate, gullible and down right lazy. blame culture feeds destructive discontent and are easily coerced and effectively manipulated  by those who offer the magic solution! Hard to accept but sadly true. Look at Russia before the rise of communism was installed and see how that resulted in the murder and destruction of at least 30 million Russian Christians. Intrinsically a very wealthy country for the masses and mostly were happy. Isn't it interesting that your masters allow this sort of broadcast :-) Just my thoughts, I've read a lot of books and I see the similar patterns and you must by now sense that the West is in serious trouble!
The royals do a lot of good, they bring in trade They don't cost per person very much, the country is civilized which it might not be if he falls.  Leave it alone
I'm not a fan of the Monarchy. I believe that they are out of touch with reality and our nations people. They look down on us as vermin but we must understand that there are people well above the Monarchy pulling all the strings in this nation and they would simply make things a LOT worse for everyone should the Monarchy be dissolved. There is a rightful blood heir to the throne and he lives in Australia, He was told that if he makes an attempt to claim that right bad things will happen to him and his family. The current Monarchy could be different or changed but "The powers that be" Need this golden puppet to dance to their tune.
I respect the position of king but not the man in it. Respect is earnt. He isnt a free thinker he parrots others to make himself saved wise.want to be a world saviour.
Nice to hear this from a British soldier. I am Irish and like all of my Irish friends I view the British monarchy for what it is. You have described it well
Prince Charles is the biggest gangster in England.  He killed Diana for finding love elsewhere for the second time. !! William is his son. Harry is not !! . Diana despised him for his controlling and petulant child like behaviour. James Hewitt the Queen handled! Dodi Fayed and being pregnant with an Arab baby was too much and the monarchy and especially Charlies who gets what he wants!! Had Diana and Dodi assassinated!!.. The monarchy is a joke and calling Camilla a queen is fuckin disgrace 😤
Child abusing family...the works of them... nothing Honorable there.
all the politicians and the monarchy, authoritarians, always controlling our lives and we should thank them for it like we owe them our health and our collective wealth. Scumbags acting as benevolent humans but they are all just parasites
I think communism is good. I think you should take a look at this one, I mean communism
In the first worldwar they changed their names from German to English to please the people. They are psychopaths and just like the dutch people they stand in line and wave their flags, so happy. And they get millions for doing nothing else then be there on a opening. English and Dutch people just grown up.
is it king or pedophile charles?
I despise every one of them
Now they are all crying because Charles is ill ,.they have very short memories,.he only married Diana so she could give him children , they are a very poisonous family no wonder Harry is so messed up
Fyi the house of windsor are not even legitimate. The last true king of england was murderd at the battle of bosworth hill , when the earl of salisbury switched sides
Thank You For Your Honesty And Courage. Please Do Not Give In!
Bullshit...you clearly don't know that they work voluntarily...please come and work for me for nothing but expenses,seriously please..I can guarantee that you won't take me up on it. He has to be best friends with those people because of trade deals etc Ironically Johhny Rotten is now almost a Royalist 😂
Train workers getting a pittance? Lol yeah right, (from a still serving soldier) I'm no fan of Charles, but he's worth a lot more than the unionist scum that ruin the country.
Thank you for straightening me out. New Zealander.
These are normal people playing house. They are robbing you blind. It's like the Vatican. Two of the most evil institutions on the planet and millions are programmed to worship them. It's too pathetic to even get angry about.
Killuminati
Come on you know what most people think of chaz since the savile revelations
Ok you was a soldier but does that really matter with what you are saying, you won't be listened to for that reason only.. To be  honest you are chatting s..t in my opinion..
In the olden days you would have been shot 😂😂. Things have changed
I do however feel that Will’s and Katherine are healthy wellmeaning individuals
This is commie bullcrap. The UK is full of communist BS, and it has been invaded by immigrants thay kill, steal, and are trying to whitewashwhat the UK stands for !!
right on brother
I'm an American and I don't think this little of Englands monarchy . 😂😂 This dude is a closet communist for sure. A bitter man by his own words .
A Phsycopathetic reptilian brain thinker he is.
Descendants of bloody mary,before king james,WTFU.
In this day and age we should be above having a king or queen ruling anybody anywhere on earth,its a joke for it to exist...
The monarchy has always been a collection of parasites. Great content ☘️
The monarchy has always been a collection of parasites. Great content ☘️
Your a disgrace to the uniform you wore
This guy is full of envy, if the roles were reversed I doubt he’d be as altruistic as he fantasises.
Playito
Q Elizabeth is seen on film making the Nazi salute when she was 8 yrs old ,the family were going to sell out to Hitler and stay in the job ,Hitler expressed his desire to do that,,,,,zThe  FIRM  were afraid that the trade unions and commies would take over,dont forget Cambridge Universty were all coomunists  eg Philby .m,clean,Burges ,Blunt and even harold Wilson
people living in tents in Cornwall ,but Charles might say"LET THEM EAT CARROTS"they are green and healthy for them
That's why the United States   split  from the United Kingdom  but its almost as  bad in the United States  now
I believe I heard that the Royals came from Germany and they changed their name from a German name to Windsor. I can’t remember for sure. Worth investigating.
i don't understand why in the modern world i have to work my entire life and pay for another families extravagant lifestyle for no reason at all except they claim they are better than me, a family that deserve palaces and luxury just for being born, what makes them so special, if they did something amazing then fair enough but i don't see simply being born as justification for making slaves out of the entire British public.
The rich will get richer ....... The working class will get less.
Charles is part of the WEF. That is bad news for our country.
King Charles exposes himself to minors 😂
Read & try to understand history, The 'leaders of the revolution' always become the 'new tyrants'. Your choice is either the Royals or the Cromwell's, Lenin's etc., who always become the new tyrants. Make your choice but for goodness sake, stop the bitching that allows you to sound off under a regime that allows you to do so & not be beheaded or shot.🧐
I NEVER TOOK TO KC YEARS AGO,  HE LOST EVERYTHING FOR ME THE WAY HE CHEATED ON DIANA  !! WILL NEVER FORGET OR FORGIVE BOTH OF THEM
So what, man?  It is the same situation with representative republics like in the States!
I lost my Instagram for saying the Royals are allergic to Melanin but addicted to incest which is a true fact... that who family is imbred. That why they go bald by time they turn 23
The royals are parasites
Well said
It’s a sick evil world these days  Hold on. It’s gonna get worse ❤
what a load of twisted, envious, uninformed left wing bilge
Been saying this about the monarchy for years! Look at the POS his son married and the shit she pulls!
No problem monarchy has already changed its form to high bourgeois and became invisible king Charles have been kept due to low pressure in UK.  Richness and knowledge is already out of publics Hands so public should keep masturbating it feels good 🤤👽
They so-called royal family are a part of the black nobilaty
The voice of reason 🎉
This whole stupid fu*king tradition of people being born into "royal families" with unbelievable wealth that was and is being stolen from the general population, and being deposited into their personal bank accounts, AND by default ruling and controlling an entire Country.  You scared little Brits need to grow a backbone, and overthrow that stupid Royal Family, and have a democracy for once
God I hope he’s not living in England
it does not take a dog of war to know the Royals are all Nazis they problem is religion The Church has always been part of the Monarchy
Only Princess Diana was in touch with the common people understanding their plights and that's why the RF made it so difficult for her. My heart still bleeds for how she was treated. 😢
Most people know now that the UK overlords/elite et al faction is all Rothschild and or Order Of The Dragon 🐉 the “Royal” family is Order Of The Blue Dragon and are all insidious and nefarious at best………you’re talking very old bloodlines here…….Diana was a pure Melchizedek ( a light being 🕊️✨ ) Charles a Merovingian ( dark nasty being ) him marrying her was considered a most high acquisition within the Order Of The Dragon families………William is half light/half dark which is why they desperately want him to take the throne……….the evil bloodline families/secret societies in all their satanic glory believe William will allow them to control everything light and dark on the planet………that is never going to happen……..because they have already lost. We have apparently entered into a “Light Age” and their darkness and evil will not be able to exist much longer. 🕊️🌅😇🤩
What about Harry walking out on them He was probably sick of the. BS
I'm welsh. we've been sick of them for 1500 years.
Soon the wars will target the royalty of UK & UN NATO. Because of child trafficking and wars for profit & the arrogant Great Britain UK take over of the world.. BRICS, OPEC ARE COLLAPSING THE UK ,UN , NATO ..
Yahoo is een mediocre platform
I don't think WEF is a good look for any king. Can't say I think much of his "Defender of Faiths" crap either. King Charles seems too aligned with Edward VIII's 'appointment with destiny via another man's wife' selfishness. TBH, I've always felt Queen Elizabeth & Prince Philip lived so long because they feared Charles wrecking the whole monarchy & sinking the ship.   If we were kids picking who we wanted on our team, who would've picked Charles? A friendless wimp in school, too weak to stand up for Camilla in the beginning, not much of a Naval man, & the devilish, contemptable, deceitful way he treated Diana... I'm sorry - I couldn't watch this man's coronation.   Prince William has a daunting task ahead of him. I hope he's a good Christian & doesn't become affiliated with WEF elitists evil. He can restore the Crown's image & the people love him.
I read that King Chuck has been gitmoed. The child trafficing caught up to him.
Right on!!!
The all pay tax… from the top down 😊
Do they do anything sex, sacrificing, blood and satanic/whitchcraft rituals?
😆😆 this guy is nuts
What would change by removing the Royal Family. Nothing.  The robber barons would do would just do what they have always done throughout history. Rebrand and continue as normal. It would be in no ones interests to believe that this wealth, when returned to the public purse, would be used for the benefit of the general public.
Charles wouldn’t back sending illegal migrants in the uk to Rwanda when he is supposed to be defender of our faith. He will say anything to stay in power and does not give a jot about ordinary British people.
Oh STFU!! How about YOU get a proper job instead of cashing in on slagging the Royal Family.
HE LOOKS SMUG AS BET HE IS ALL TALK AND NO ACTION
WHEN I LEFT SCHOOL THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO JOINED THE ARMY WERE PEOPLE TOO THICK OR NO MATES YOU SOUND AS THICK AS THEY COME YOU GUTLESS  PR TT
In ancient days the kings in Britain went out to war and led the soldiers in battle, even dying in battle.  That, of course, is not true today.  One could say that in earlier times the Kings earned their status not just by inheritance, but by shear physical force on the battlefield.  They also for good or ill ran the country.  The royal family today certainly don’t run the country.  They are just figureheads and get paid mightily for it.  It will be up to the British people to decide that, but they seem to like the pomp and circumstance.
AHAHAHAHAH what a dick long live the king
I used to go along with monarchy until I realised Charles extensive involvement with corrupt WEF
What about cleaners and shop workers we all work hard
Well said👍 How many homeless people could be homed in Buckingham Palaces thousands of rooms, *used just by one family*?
I dernt comet what I think of this shower of scroungers 🤬
Thank you
God granted them with so much and they bleed just like anyone else  how on earth can one point the finger at one and they're just as guilty...I seriously believe that  the Royals had blk ball Harry only because he married Megan M,from that all the jealousy and eye rolling, ugly gestures and ect caused a ripe in the royal family...UK should understand how they're making a bitter sweet feeling toward  this out sides life w/ his family.
@luisortiz..I'm grateful...graced that I was born in the USA and Catholic
Fully agree we should vote these pedos out an be able to vote a leader in  Well said my friend
He may be correct about many things, but he is so bitter and twisted in himself that his answer (defacto communistic revolution) is as bad, if not worse, than the leaders he rages against (history repeating itself).  Freedom and equality cannot exist together if you think about it .. because we are all blessed with very different skills and abilities.  Therefore, we need leaders who understand this so any change can be practical as well as just satiating our own demons (which is where this kind of agitator is negatively focused).  I would shudder to see the results of this man's revolution. The 'powers that should not be' are waiting patiently for this type of blinkered pushback, so they can justify fiercer restrictions inc Marshall Law.  We need leaders who are just as bold but who also show signs of conquering their own hatred.  Jesus said 'Love your enemies'.  Such an attitude will surely lead, at very least, to wiser, more measured, and statesmanlike words.
Yep along with the Vatican , Farnase , Medici families etc it goes on
Looks like Karma is coming to get him soon. Charlie boy you are going to meet a lot of angry spirits soon.
So in America, they have divested themselves of being ruled by a royalty of arbitrarily important people. Instead, they raise up sports and entertainment figures to stardom and give them the same extra special red carpet adulation the royals get in the UK. It seems the nature of people to want to place special powers and importance on a few elites and bow down to them in one way or another.
Royalty is a man-made invented lie
Around 2002 I was in Santiago Chile and People were speaking about Prince Charles then now King he had a girlfriend Lucia Santa Cruz they were overheard having a conversation about conciousness and this is basically what was said” when the people learn to harmonize the mind & emotion it’s over for the royalty”
❤
I agree wholeheartedly!
Stupid people that admire these people
Enough with kings and royals they are so filthy
The main thing you need to understand or remember is there hasn't been an England since 1066. And it wasn't just William and his army who destroyed it. He brought along another group that changed the law and destroyed the culture.
Was the queen involved in missing Canadian children?
HE IS NOT MY KING, former Irish Guards...  Bless the TRUE QUEEN that SHOULD of been.... Princess Diana. Bring on Princes William, with his mother in him...... Should be fucKING interesting..
You lost me at the "doctors fighting for a pittance" bit.
He’s just jealous - someone has a better life than someone else and he’s full of envy and spite.
The Royals are parasites imo.
So much truth here...
Why are the British people so into this monarchy??
He is just wrong  What did he do for him to get out of his JOB !!!!!
Of course there is a connection with the Royalty and the French why on earth do you think Charles as soon as the French got kicked out of Africa went directly over to France to speak with the president to ask if the gold mines and the gold that had been stolen from Africa was safe and does anything lead back to their involvement.....
On he 3rd of July in 1776, a secret dercee was signed with the US and England. It changed absolutely nothing.  So on th 4th of July 1776 people really  thought that they was independent from  England. Gullible.
He ain't my king.
I get it but we are where we are because of our past.
Dumb to have royals.
Adulterers!!!!! fornicaters!!!!
Eat your jealous hearts out...
What a numpty
It’s the people round them protect them the royal  family they will all be masons
I love you for TELLING  THE  TRUTH!!
All I know is that the USA kicked your butts in 1776
Charles is a Muslim. I thought the King had to defend the Church of England. He doesn’t qualify
The British Royalty is a disgrace on all fronts, and it goes back generations. Look at the Scandinavian and Dutch Royalty who understand that they are servants for their people and not like Britain Royals who believe the people are their servants and slaves. The present King is an adulterer and his brother a known pervert
This idiot really thinks the Windsor family is worse than the russian or italian mafia or hells angels and other bikers and all other organized crime? Hes either a criminal himself or delusional
Thank you very much for speaking the Truth i agree with everything you said 1,000 times
The royals came from a farmer, in the middle ages because he had a lot of Wealth and property they made the farmer King. The royals don't have royal blood they are just like you and me. I have never been a royalist they make me 🤮 they think they are above everyone and they came from a wealthy farmer. Charles' is not a Christian he is not my king the only King is the Lord Jesus. I am From Australia
He had join the Rothc*ild lineage when Britain was going under in 1850, so he like all the other leaders is a J*w.
long live the hood
it wasn't the sex pistols it was motorhead who wrote the song and hated the Royals
England colonized and enslaved 65 countries. Stole their riches. Now there are 15 countries. Currently 3 are working towards a Reforendum.  And Brexit, the final nail in the coffin.
Charles shot himself in the foot years ago. Some things  will not allow redemption.
King Charles is not my king he is a disgrace.
Quick reminder of charlies roots.  Sax Coburg. German. His mother and Aunt gleefully doing hiel hitler salutes for the Camera. Grandfathers brother cosy with Hitler. Charlies mentor before the IRA blew him up loved fiddling with little boys.  Friends with clergy who did the same.  Brother... same.  Its a family tradition!  Diana was no sooth sayer... but predicted her death and the MO to a tee... strange that  Camillas husband was boffing Anne at one point... keeping it in the family.  Remember the footage of a nude guy climbing ..escaping!  From Buck palace as tourist filmed herself. ... its a complete shower o shite from top to bottom.  Even Phillip liked the company of sailors... in the seaman terms.   If this lot were your family... you'd disown them.  As for Shwab who has roots deep seated in a particular wartime regieme... best mstes with fellow kraut... yep.  Ol grubby chubby fingers
As far as I know the only 2 royals that have served is Andrew and Harry
Conspiracy People like yourself are the biggest danger to truth and freedom. Hypocrite, Swear an oath  of loyalty tobyhe monarch, then lie and try to bring it down!
Just don't join the forces.  Don't lay your life down so  the Royals and Global Elites can live in luxury. God Bless ❤️ 🙌  Thanks so much for this video. Yes the Windsors a Mafia run business.🤮🤮 They are above the law.👎👎
You people are crazy. Maybe jealous
Charles waited 70 yrs for a job .. then goes off sick 🤒 😂
None of the Windsors have a legitimate claim to the throne as they're descended from one of Edward the Fourth's archers who had in for him while he was away. The rightful heir was Simon Michael Edward Abney Hastings the 23rd Baron Hastings. He died last year,but has descendants.
This guy is correct the Royals are just a bunch of parasites.
Oh china and russia nth korea thyre the baddest of all😂😂😂😂
Whilst I have the upmost respect for the people of the UK, I could never understand the British people’s worship of the parasitical R0yal family.  And King Charles is NOT a nice guy.  Great video.
Oh cmon. Quit picking on king charles. He married old horseface and now he cant afford to unleash old horseface.     I wouldnt tKe her to a dogfight if i thought she might win!  Ges stuck with that ugly old bag forever!
" I,M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH CHRISTIANITY AND DON,T THINK I,LL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN GOVERNORSHIP OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND ONCE I,M KING."     Prince William  ( GB NEWS 29-1-24 , hosted by Andrew Pierce)
When they turn the pages  of history  when these  days seem ling time ago will they read of us with sadness  of the seeds that we let grow we tern are gayses too the castles  in the distance  eyes cast down to the path of least resistance   ...rush  farewell  to kings.
It's now time for "AUSTRALIA" to become a republic.
What a nasty piece of work this commentator is. And I'm not even British! 🤬
100% great speech
YES!!! This channel rocks! ❤❤❤
A lot of what he said is true about our Gov.
Well done 👏👏 I wish some one would stand up like you here in Denmark 🇩🇰  😘
I don’t support the monarchy or what it stands for but this bloke is a moron.
Not my king ! He’s a hypocrite and an adulterer and the royals attitude when Diana died was disgusting. They are horrible people !
Got rich selling opium
Totally agree 100%
As an American we are taught we created this country to escape the corruption of the monarchy. After the victory of the revolutionary war we tried to make George Washington king….He refused and wrote down all the reasons that was wrong but you really can’t fix stupid so …In truth we only traded the title of our leaders that live like kings with wealth beyond most peoples imagination. Apparently the apple didn’t fall far from the tree.
The UK needs another referendum. this time on leaving the USA.
I am ashamed to be British. now more than ever with both major political parties supporting the murderous Fascist regime in Israel
Don't suppose he knows any of them, he sounds like a Desperado Anarchist himself to me mad man 👎👎👎👎
I must agree...
This is a bitter man. He's the type who is envious and jealous of anyone who has more than he has.  Hind of a spoilsport type who complain about money spent for celebrations and festivals too. The only thing that this guy  would not rant about is that if he received a government check.  Things like National pride does not register with this type either. Generally he is a sad sack.
Agreed 👌
You ran away Glenton. You ran away.
Your O.B.E. is in the post.
Totally agree. I'm in the USA, why are we so obsessed with the monarchy? We got rid of then over 250:yrs ago. I don't get why we care or are even interested in that bs. Personally, I don't know why people want to give their hard earned money to people that don't give a damn about them much less their needs. But then again, the supposed 2 parties here aren't any different. People are such sheep!
Wow great listening to you .
Instant subs for this one 👍👏🙌
Thank you! Had a similar hunch about this topic the Monarchs..
They bring millions of pounds into the British economy and whatever Charles is or isn't, a power hungry President would be no better.
We don't call him King Charles, the Turd for nothing....
Australia for a Republic.    My relatives were persecuted by the the Brits in the mid 1800's.  Our family the Quinns fought hard with their cousins the Kelly's for human rights.  They were imprisoned and they hung Ned Kelly in 1880.  Family trauma is past down each generation.  Wake up to the Royals.
You seem to totally forget, that you all, have VOTED those politicians into power that have destroyed your economy..... Y'all are "scraping by" because you voted to live that way. The Royalty is apart of English British culture. If you don't like having an English Monarchy.... than move to American. It was created by the British Rebels for the future Americans to be free of Royalty.
How is Prince Andrew not in prison!
The Monarchy, biggest scam in the history of the world.
My respect for this thinking, honorable soldier! In my opinion, these are some of the most important personalities in any healthy society. Soldiers who think and express their own opinions. Because they will never deign to shoot innocents and civilians just because they are ordered to do so. And people who think, who question their societies and their systems, are what bring them forward. Everything else is cowardice coupled with cruelty. And let's not forget, the definition of true fascism is a monarchist aristocratic system.
YESH YEAH AND NOW KING CHARLES HAS CÁNCER ‼️🇬🇧 3:54
I enjoyed your monologue of it all. What these boutique type don't fear any reprisal for there corruption. They have protection to erode our rights. But just wait because we will get more of the same in our one and a half party system.
this is just bitterness and resentment
Not my king   Truth will come out and people will awake one day.   I wouldn’t want to be him on judgement day   He should be the leader of the church
The knobs got more medals than Napoleon.
Brilliant commentary and so true, thank you!
Hear hèar 👏👏👏👏👏 well said .
We should get rid of Royalty.There are Germans.Why should they have a great life.When other people are suffering in Britain.This country is not worth fighting for.Carnt Look after its own people.
His latest health issues will cut his time short, hopefully.
110 million they spent from the tax payer when lock downs where going on ? I'm a veteran aswel, they're a waste of space
😂😂😂😂 I hope you’re not expecting a knighthood.
Yeah, we saw this way back in the 1700s in America so you know we did in 1776 we kicked  king  George to the curb
Gee, if Donald doesn't make it in the US maybe you can get him over here, that would just be so much better wouldn't it.
Talking about an elected head of state by whom exactly? The same backward sheep that voted in Boris and Brexit? The people of this country have become spineless and talk a good game but yet nothing changes.
The British royal family blood had come from Schleswig-Gota bloodline which is German. They changed their name to Windsor quite recently. Britain is continuation of the Holy Roman Empire of German Nation.
Our Father God. Show your mercy on Charles and his family as they face this evil challenging time that the Devil himself created when he was hiding IN A WELL KNOWN JEWEL of the Church of England. As the Devil only knows how to lie steal and kill, I can only recommend Charles himself realises how important it is for the king to repent for all his and his families past bullying mistakes before Jesus Christ of Nazareth. However, in the meantime many people should stop interfering with this families personal lives. Slagging of princess Meghan at this stage of the kings challenge and free will is not helping them or their children to just cope. Media in Britain has far to much power, One only has to look at the published news and underhanded comments of the privy council following reporters to see how they manipulate and disrespect the whole royal family. The Masonic commentators below need to keep their comments to themselves because they are just not called for by anyone facing this life threatening illness at this awful time. In Jesus' mighty name Amen.
The monarchy should be dismantled, our so called king is a WEF puppet traitor.
At least the people aren't forced to knell down to them anymore.
If you want a king then you pay for it, and only you !!!!!!
You know, it's not just about money, although this can be a tell-tale sign, as you said unaccountable power is the real issue. And the way royalty and all has ended up to be, maybe you should consider abolishing it. I mean, sure, it is in your tradition, then again, as humanity progresses we need to re-evaluate our ideals or traditions, especially when the later don't really serve the people or even a purpose. Royalty in the past was totally different to what it is today, and even back then, you could see all the signs of untold corruption in certain cases. Then, there's the Diana incident, I don't wanna point fingers here, but this wasn't an accident. The fact that Prince Charles did have an affair and wanted someone else, as well as the way Diana was excluded from all royal, the whole thing is suspect. On the other hand, he should have a say in all this, including the way he sees the monarchy, there is nothing worse than being an actual honest man in all the surrounding scum and getting blamed for everything, whether you're a king or not it doesn't matter. This too has happened in history, albeit far less often.
If we are tearing down and re-building then the 1st to go should be the Monarchy and the House of Lords and the Labour Party, the 3 most destructive elements in UK society
I totally concur with all that you say!!
Eagerly waiting for Charles to abdicate the throne
❤❤❤Good for you ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I am a 78 year old Canadian woman and could not agree with you more; I have been saying this for decades, but it seems more true and real today than ever.  Who and how was this great lie ever started so long ago anyway.   Much love and may God bless you and hopefully you will reach some open and curious minds.   Amen.
Thank you. This horrible group that 💩
Certainly Charles is flawed, as are all of us. However he is not as bad as made out here. Compare this king of Britain with another king of another country of another time, King David of Israel [reigned 10th century BC]. He was  flawed, read about his affair with Bathsheba, but he is revered.
Whether it’s a king, a president, a prime minister or whatever, we are always ruled by gangsters. People are not willing to rise and defend their rights and freedom until very bad shit happens. With the technology available today it is more difficult to protest, especially when the police and armed forces are in the payroll of the rulers. It’s not too late however and “something” can and has to be done. The sooner the better.
It’s not just the royals! Society puts social media influencers on a pedestal whilst excellent doctors and everyday hero’s are ignored!
Royalty is a scam just look at them they look like bunch of clowns
Ive been thinking alot of this stuff lately and have been brushing up on the "English civil war" this video has cleared up a lot of my questions as i seemed to be getting two sides of the story at times not sure how it worked out.
Is it true that Charles and his Mother had Princess Diana killed.   ?
The New World Order are directed by the British royalty.  Krus Schwab, George Soros, Bill Gates report to the British Kung whom direct their activities.  This round table was state after world war one look up the history.
why he is so resentive on his own life and reflect in against British monarchy?
F*CKING WELL SAID! Just about every single word you said in this video echoes what I've been saying for decades! Excellent points, very well made! A man after my own heart! 👍👍👍
we have the English Constitution that can sort  out Charles the TURD and the TYRANTS In Parliament the Judiciary and the Civil service
JUST LIKÈ BBC😂
THE MONARCHY IS NOTHING BUT LOOTERS!!! TIME IS CLOSING IN TO JUSTIFY ALL ITS MALICIOUS & DECEITFUL INFLUENCE & PROPAGANDA FOR THEIR HIGHLIFE!!
God save the king
I totally believe that. And he is bringing his son's to do his EVIL DOINGS. THERE NOTHING BUT A MAFIA. THEY ARE PREDITOUR S AND ANDREW IS ASSOCIATED WITH MANY BILLIONAIRES THAT ARE PREDITOUR S AS WELL. BELIEVE ME. THEIR UK MILITARY INTELLIGENCE KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE DOING. THEY DON'T EVEN QUESTIONS ANYTHING THEY DO. WE, WANT HARRY OUT OF OUR COUNTRY  HARRY, NOT WILLIAM WILL BE KING.
The Royals own 1/2 the land of London and the Grovernor's own the rest.. You'd  really hate Joe Biden's Presidency
That was a nothing burger.
Joe Glenton is a good peer.
We say we live in a modern world. Yet, signs, symbols and bloodlines still rule the world.  Go figure
"Royal" inbreeding shines through wingnut Charles. Two words - No Good. One word- Creep. Last word - Charade !!!
Wow thats honesty!!! Thankyou
They are all cons who harm humanity
i agree with you
How interesting. Thank you. What a  crying shame.
the biggest act of treachery is by the King himself as the defender of the Faith he has acquiesced to allow Islam to become the most prominent and destructive ideology in the country, he has and continues to sell his country to the dogs, the dogs of Islam at the expense of his sworn undertaking to God and his people.
Lots of spelling mistakes in my reply. One is they come up nit vote up. They  haven't.  And not Ghana  God but  thank God.
You are a voice blowing in the wind.  Nothing  will be done, when people  are being fed this glitz and glamour  . Their PR has done and still do, duping the gullible.. They are here to stay and Nothing will shift them. No amount of scandals, they vote up shining  and the good guys. They are sitting  on billions, and have the slightest  bit of pity and sympathy for the strugg masses. But Ghana God the younger generation have wised up to everything and can get information  of any kind. Just  let's hope that if they are ousted, we don't get someone  like Cromwell. That's  what  happens when anyone  has supreme  power
Shut up
The royal families need to loose their royalty.  They are parasites on the people
They are spoilt entitled rubbish!! The people of the UK would be so much better off without them!!
Jealousy maks you nasty 😂
Time Australia became a Republic
The Royals an inbred leaches on society.. everything you said was absolutely right.. they are a criminal organisation and I hope the British people will wake up
Alba Gu Brath !
This Yank like to say, once you get rid of one monarch, don't replace it with another you thought was on your side. Like the super-rich and elites pushing this reset, where they will take everything away from you and your back to square one.
He said inbred morons
Perennial Parasites that is what they are !!
Hes no king of mine. Corrupt german psychopath.
The biggest criminals are the ones who shake your hand too harsh.
New Model Army 🔥🔥
They already live in the most expensive council house in the country,  Buckingham Palace.
William is doing a great job & trying to produce homes for thousands of homeless . He will make a great King
I remember being  taught about Cromwell at school in the 1960's, can't remember from which angle though.
In 1984 I was 10, Princess Diana drove past our school on her way to somewhere...we were instructed to make little Union Jack flags and line the road  waving them as she went past... I found the whole thing humiliating and refused to wave my flag... looking back I wish I'd written something insulting on the flag or maybe just drawn this 🖕🏼😂
Where are the people who mocked the regime and monarchy? Ask the educational system as it is designed to breed brainless culture with no thinking capacities.
I partly agree. Though people are hooked up on taxes, royals made taxes. They also oversee laws so the government do their thing without dictating...though the speaker certainly doesn't make the house of Lords how it should. Heckling and undermining shouldn't be politics as a way to climb the career ladder. It should be all for the citizens needs and wishes with some decision for us with things beyond us. I don't stand by the decision but I empathise the decision that her for example did to us in the North east
Charles WEF puppet And friend of Savilles
I see little difference between royalty (not just in UK) and hollywood. It's mostly idol worship from people who need a life---and so they choose those who live in luxury and privilege at the people's expense. These individuals in turn will never ever give up their privilege. It's a match made in heaven (hell).
Smart man 👌
You should move country and shut your mouth, ex army what was your rank?
I wonder how many other soldiers or Ex soldiers come to think the same ?
Its true we never get told much about Cromwell and the English civil war
The Royal family gives many people alot of happiness. Gives people a lift in this world of ups and downs. That is their relevance now. Let It Be!
Fair play for your analysis. We have known all about them for centuries. ❤ from Ireland 🇮🇪.
I've always intuitively knew as a kid and esp now despite the hype about royal blood that i feel are what could be stipulated as demonic blood. the uk should no longer have monarchy and must inventory what wealth are really theirs or what was stolen from the people, that I'm sure accumulated so much growths and profits. they've been oppressing the masses with living like the most spoiled evil people that their household broke their backs and died for, just to have everything be run the pettiest of perfection. monarchy is occultism and of course mafia-ism and their thugs the mi-#'s.
Insulting podcasts are so off-putting.  That's why the term "whinging  Poms"  started in Australia.  It's an English characteristic which Aussies nailed!  The Monarchy has many faults - where power is, corruption thrives.  eg :Charles has blood on his hands etc..  People will listen to researched facts delivered in an educated manner.   Otherwise you just sound like another whinging Pom with a chip on the shoulder.  You have a million views but I turned off.
The only person i answer to will be God himself, not this self centered piece of sh@t!!!!
This thing called "king" has £130 million a year! Wtaf!!!!
Charles almost looks as grand as Idi Amin with all his self appointed medals on his rediculous costume
You are so right
So what have you done to contribute apart from moan on a video. Ha …much less. Collect ta. Ions for ya views kid your behaving just the same talking bollocks to get money….. get a job
I totally agree with you.  They are there because they are crooked.  I think the monarchy should discontinue.  I dont understand their purpose.  We can cut ribbons too.
Although I don’t entirely disagree with some of the comments in this video. There’s so many other things far more important to sort out in this country first.
Look at the medals Charles has,he must of been brave during the war
"God save the Queen, she ain't no human being "
Well done and well said. Finally someone said what alot have been thinking
They are bloodlines of a reptile race.
The money the royal family received was offered in exchange for land. The royal family do bring in a lot more money then they cost and also help this country to win contracts from other countries.  The royal family have been at the centre of British life for over a thousand years and are a symbol of continuity.  The British people hated it when we became a republic and could not wait for restoration of King Charles II.  Presidents often cost more money than having a monarch and they do not generate the same kind of music. The late Queen gave 70 years loyal service to this country, she always put country before family. We do not have to compare ourselves with other countries and definitely not the French, we have far more to be proud of than they do.  I am not a lover of King Charles and do not agree with him on anything or approve of the people he is friends with, especially the Davos lot. King Charles will have a short reign before he abdicates because he is so unpopular. Prince William will either save the royal family for future generations or lead us into a republic, we will just have to wait and see. The Royal family was very popular under the late Queen, the public mourned her death in their millions around the world. She was well respected around the world because she had been there through all resent historical events.  We have one of the oldest and best political systems in the world and that is constitutional monarchy.
He is a puppet….!!! Groot gat kruiper..!!
So King Charles the C...er the tur...er third has a thoracic duct occlusion. What a great pity. You never wish ill on anyone but some fellas just earn it.
Harry should be king.  !!!!!!!!!!
The Establishment, in all its forms, exists. The easiest way to get a knock on the door at 3 in the morning is to criticise any facet of their existence.
Royals are not relevant today! Make them fund their own lifestyle! Or exile them
*_Hundreds of years ago the King on horseback would lead his loyal army into battle. Now we have no king with any moral compass nor a loyal army willing to die so that the king can keep his privileges & land. Sad but true. Respect is earned & as far as I can see they deserve absolutely no respect!_*
Not my king him & his son William is with the WEF scumbags
They are actually German and not English.
That x soldier is a traitor  😤
Same thing in USA. They brutalized their way into America and own us. Everyone of our congressmen and women, get fabulously rich, illegally mind you, while keeping the stupid people down as slaves. I’ve heard it said by high ranking Satanists, that they will control us by brainwashing and mind control. The idiots watch television and Internet and get spells cast upon them. No longer a thinking class of people. Thanks, Capt Joe.
What would we have in its place? American style?  They are all squikey clean. Not!  I think we stay were we are. Better the devil you know in this case.
Watch your tongue you snake
KC3 is now promoting the WEF, no real surprise here. Speaking German, as homage to his late father I expect, whose sisters were all married to Nazi officers.....who fought with Hitler. QE2 and her sister were even expected to practice the Third Reich  salute, as children, under coaching of their parents. .......about that ?  Says a lot about their heritage.
The size of their dressing up box beggars belief.  I bet they have every uniform that exists and then some!
King Charles I was martyred by the iconoclastic Puritans. Those wicked men have continued to exist today, merely in a secular cloak - that being the woke left. They abhore this country and her indigenous inhabitants to its very core and showcase it by rioting, looting and vandalising monuments.  Charles I was a King but his policies were in line with that of the common man by preserving the beauty of holiness and majestic ritual and tradition within the liturgy. The Puritans enforced their bland, soulless, intellectual theology on the common folk - like how Marxist academics of today inflict misery on the common folk with their soul-destroying multiculturalism and religion of anti-racism. Displace the indigenous people of this country, all the while telling them they're racist for opposing it.  Marxist radicals infesting academia seek to cause unrest and misery for their greater goal of bringing about their revolution. During the Interregnum, there existed a sect called the 'Fifth Monarchists', who sought to facilitate the biblical end times by deliberately seeking to create the environment befitting such an event.  This video only alludes to two revolutions in other countries, it neglects to mentions the revolution in Russia - 80 years of the murderous, despotic government in history and Marxist brainwashing and yet the Holy Orthodox Church and Tsarism (in practice if not on paper) eventually re-emerged prevailed.  As for Britain's revolution, it was also a revolution of a predatory self-seeking intellectual class (within which the Levellers were merely a minority) who abhored the values of order, stability, tradition.  Though this wasn't the primary driver, a factor in the desire for the Restoration was an increasingly militant group of Quakers. An armed uprising of Quakers? Not unlike the burning, looting, rioting, iconoclastic who peddle hate and bitterness towards the indigenous people all in the name of causes such as 'anti-racism'.
This bloke is an ex British soldier? Sounds more like a communist to me!
Nice one mucker you have it worked out, the problem is what to do
The Royal  Tory turds 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩🤡
Royal social parasites  , criminals , Royals stole all the land & they perpetuate  class and snobbery
Why do they want to depopulate the planet so urgently? Because they know we the people are rising and waking up. There are more of us than them and that terrifies them, which it should.
Monarchie hoort sowieso niet te bestaan in 2024. Middeleeuws gebeuren allemaal.
I come from Greece. I ve lived in England for quite a while in the 90s. I love your country, but I don't like the royals. Not just the British ones. I don't like royals all over the world. I don't agree with monarchy. I love the British punk movement. Ok, maybe not so much the Sex pistols, as i love the Clash 😊😁 and the whole punk movement and the whole idea behind it and I am with the people and not with the " top " and the " powerful " ones. I believe that people have the power. I love your video and I hope your book goes great. I agree with everything you said.  You have other history to show to the world and a very powerful and revolutionary one. I hope someday the British will understand that they should stop being the submissive followers of any crown, any monarch, any supposedly powerful higher kind of creature in the world, and they will stand up for their rights properly and fight for them. I hope someday the people in Britain will understand and start the great revolution against the oppressive people that believe that they come from another God and that they are divine and that they need slaves to pay extra taxes and work for them. I do hope from the bottom of my heart that the British will revolt against this system and let democracy rise alone . Pure and great as it is. As all of you are over there. Proud and strong people that you will liberate yourselves and open your minds more. You have a much better legacy than any kind of palace to show to the world. You have great literature and poets and arts. You have Robinhood, and you have this great punk music movement, you have great cult figures like Vivienne Westwood and so many others that you really need to turn to and pay attention to what they had to say to you, in order to realize that this system of yours and them royals take advantage of you for so many years, and have made you believe that the only valuable thing you have to show and be proud of is the monarchy and them greasy royals that they pretend to be the humanitarian, that they care for the people. No, you don't deserve that at all, and I hope one day the British will become wiser and throw the masters out and bring Democracy in their land. And the gap between the rich and the poor will become smaller and smaller. I love the UK . I love Britain and I love your people. But it's time to wake up. As anyone who accepts a Master as their ruler is a slave. I believe that the British people are proud and not submissive, little weak ones. They are not slaves of any moron... But they are powerful and strong, independent individuals willing to fight for their rights and for Democracy itself ✊️❤🇬🇧 Again, congrats for your video !!! 👏👏👏
Good video
Charles the Weak should abdicate. He's a jealous little man who is willing to let his darling boy come back and endanger the Waleses. So many snakes in the family and imo William will straighten and shake things up.😊
Didnt diana say they brought jimmy saville in to be mediator in their marriage 🤔🤮🤮 that says it all really,
One angry man. Love the music, great video. Breathe hun, too 😁
Very well said👍
Rubbish.
The minute he said I want to be known as defender of the faiths rather than the one true faith it was done for me.
Very eloquently put Sir!! Clearly a very intelligent guy!! We could do with an Oliver Cromwell type figure now!!! Get shut of these over-privileged inbreds once and for all. If the royal family gave even 1% of their gigantic wealth away they could help save millions of starving people worldwide. All they are interested in is keeping their status and power intact
Midevil
Many many thanks for this video. I do completely agree...
This (& ALL the rest of it) is why I can see that Harry GTFO & I admire him for it.
Not my king !!
I agree & also I think Harry saw this & the media has vilified him for trying to expose these gangsters  & Andrew 🤯  protecting a nonce 🤯 people all over the world are laughing at us , we now have a king that says he wishes he was a tampon , waken up people  !!!
What you say is all the more true that the actual king is even worse than yourself may imagine. You should know that a growing portion of christian believers are increasingly pointing their attention to this man. Unfortunately you will never be able to get rid of him. The only solution is to find the Righteous King who can save you from this one. See more about K. Ch. in the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMTSuwocYmw&t=55s
I new Diana before the royals got their hands on her and the problem they caused her
The current system is based or stems from the caste system that arose in the east . Kings claimed they had legitamacy to rule as they were appointed by god , their priests strengthened this legitamacy . Oldest trick in the book x
Well done Joe, l agree with everything you say. I can't abide anyone who puts themselves on a pedestal, and the monarchy are experts at that. I believe they will all be finished this year. The storm is coming!
The are all monarchs hipócritas  with no hart to the humanity
Its an open secret that many royals wanted peace with Hitler but its always treated as a move on nothing to see here discussion.
Got it all by force,their parasites
Well spoken!  Until the nation as whole, wake up and rise up to the realisation of what's been going on for so many decades, it will inevitably continue well into the next century.  If we still accept to financially support and allow this so called family of non-sovereign, non-British blood-line impostors to get away with their criminal behaviour and open contempt for the British public, then who else can we blame?
this isnt really an expose. you havnt disclosed anything but an opinion.
For me i disliked them both from the moment they hurt PRINCESS DIANA  !! NOW 80 I STILL FEEL THE SAME
Sausage fingers... I'll just leave that here !
Despite being obscenely wealthy through generational theft, they have declared war on the rest of the little people....us!
Well said! Thank God there are English men like this that can see through all the hypocrisy and BS. Besides beligerant and puritan Cromwell, don't forget honest working men like Watt Tyler and John Ball and the Peasants Revolt... nor Guy Fawkes ...nor the Chartists, the Luddites,  etc..  The English always stood against their own over bearing authoritarian overlords. They exported this sense of freedom, individuality and fight to America ( hence the birth of the USA).... that's not taught in schools today. EnglandUK is now ensconced with Elitist/ Globalists running the show hence the wokism, mass immigration, diversity, etc.. taking the precedence over real issues that affect English people todsy.
Charles is not interested in us he wants the new world order which in not good for us. As they say we will own nothing and be happy. Well we say NO to him and them!!
Your King and country needs you 😂 f offffffff
Charlie has been overlooked in the many praising YT videos for what he did to Diana. If it stinks like a skunk it IS a skunk ..........
He inherited a mess
Diana knew.
Charles is an obsolete king but he will pay for his concealed Crimes. Besides he has a twisted mind. How could he prefer that woman to Princess Diana?!😢
I have been a lifelong Republican but we need to think of a serious alternative to the joke that is British royalty. There are several republican models and I have lived in republics for the last 30 years. I would reject both the French and the Italian models. Republicans need to think very carefully to avoid a Royalist backlash.
How do we know he didn't kill mummy off to get there quickly
Diana died because she wanted to be queen and him king that's why
When your ready to talk about fre emasons and the city of London ill listen.   This pro working man routine is worthless.
Congratulations your loyal! centuries of disease,famine,warfare,inflation,unobtainable education, warfare again allways benefiting a different culture,shit pay,high tax’s,social interaction that’s when your living,missing limbs,disfigured,got your number,buried in the ground,humiliated,called racist and bias nepotism that’s to cater to a different culture,impersonated with no real accountability or dependability,all you really are is a bank account for the government, I was told I live in a fairy tale from being military here in Canada you can keep your church’s,schools,politics shit,respect shit one more point I ain’t going to rememberence day until until veterans are respected properly I have 2 generations of medals you can keep your poppy make sure fuckers enjoy their freedom selfish dirty behaviour someone else is paying for it I also know other countries have billions of our tax payers dollars enjoy our money have a big party while we live like dogs we got gauged while stationed in Germany well hey no one here knows just why we’re there! Other cultures think we wave flags not reality at all no one really signs up for British law or buys into it except for sabre rattling self congratulatory jealous civs anyway! Tell king Charlie enjoy our money and pumpkin carriage were doing the dirty work
The monarchy has supported israel and its illegal occupation of palestine.
lol,  that is real truth.
Will this idiot just notice the many many millions spend each week by football fans to go to football games also spending millions on jerseys, jackets.
So this is the only way you can make your money ? Go get a real job!
If Charles was anything like a proper man he would have said ''No I will not have a £100 million Coronation while my subjects are struggling like crazy''.  But the arrogant leach went ahead, not my King.
I know what you mean mate! We have one of those in Australia and " he's called Albanese". Bloody drop kicks!
Not even Windsor, the name Saxe-Coburg-Gotha came into the British Royal Family in 1840 with the marriage of Queen Victoria to Prince Albert, son of Ernst, Duke of Saxe-Coburg & Gotha. Queen Victoria herself was the last monarch of the House of Hanover.
And that there is the reason why you're FORMER...
Everybody knows that Charles is an idiot but most of the British people look away from it.Jimmy Saville was one of his best friends, enough said.
BANG ON!!!
Tainted person...who respects that....??? No one!
I forgot, They are really German 🥶🤬🫤😬
Why people don’t see truth 🤷‍♀️. They bribe people to donate.  Do the research 👍🙄🇺🇸.awesome video
He's an old drunk
The lord showed me a vision that I walk into a room and pulled a sword from a stone
Gesara is coming  Good hes not chairman of committee of 300 but king Tiburcio Villamor Marcus
And Greece is among the few nations – and the only EU member state – not to have been officially visited by the Queen.  And It gives me immense pleasure to announce that, indeed.
If you don't like it go to another country. What utter nonsense
I believe there is a change coming soon ! Shocking news coming from UK and the RF.
Drip drip Drip  All coming out
They will fall Gods hand is moving  All their servants  Need to wake up
France has been sold and we got minus macron
Disgusting waste of money
So so true in all areas
I heard a rumour that W & C are encouraging their children to have strong, meaningful careers in anticipation of George never taking the throne that may be gone by then.
There blood line a really not the royal family. In fact, they stole that and killed hat they thought was the blood line thinking they didn’t have a so but if act did and was in hiding. They are fake. And all they do is tak from citizens and countries to get them rich
You are a disgrace to our country.  You are talking about parliament rulings.  Are you so blindly hating our monarchy shame on you.  Our Royal family bring focus on charities and money that would never happen.  As an ex soldier you are a disgrace to this country and need your hate speech to yourself.
WOW! There's still hope for England,  glad that not everybody is brained washed over there! Wish that the wind of change will blow in the USA as well!
Yet.................................. you took an oath of allegiance.  So how do you rationalise and ratify that aspect of your glittering military career?  I'm not going to pander to your spieling drivel like so many here - if you very clearly despise them so much, then leave............  tata.
What would a fucking soldier know. Pure horseshit.
I may share some Common Ancestry with King Charles and Even I don't Like Him, Especially his ties to the World Economic Forum,World Health Organization and Relationships of the English Churches Relationships with the Mormon and Catholic Churches! Honestly,I think Charles was just sneakier then his Brother Andrew! Yet Joe Biden was Equally as Embarrassing to see with Charles,and also Believe Biden maybe Related to Bidamon who's associated with the Mormon Church! Yet Awful Stories about both the Catholic and Mormon Churches!
The Monarchy perpetuate archaic parisitical rule. They have no place in the 21st century. Their popular lifestyles are obscene and Mock the working classes and those who live in abject poverty.
Don’t believe a word this man says he should be locked up for treason he would have been in the old days
the rich and the royals are the ones that should be taxed
It’s time the Royals suffered from redundancy just like the working man that toils to feed his family, after feeding the Royals first. What the royals bring in from tourism is sucked off by the cost to keep them.
I always wonder that they can get this money for arch age pantomimes ! Yet we haven’t got money for anything else… NHS homeless.  Schools. I believe  every word.
Lockheed is American not English
Any artists that mock or challenge them...are sensored or shadow banned, and have been since 911 ... they are out there, just most are too lazy or afraid to look anymore. https://youtu.be/yytGYcgeQSw?si=D6IV52n3iKkDagj2
Wake the f… up English citizens !! Time to f… OFF THE MONARCHY !!  Your tax payer’s money is keeping them living the evil corrupt life… while YES !  you go basically begging for money !  YES IT DOES VERY MUCH EFFECT ITS CITIZENS !!
They enjoy mocking & using us as their play toys
A woke feminine ex solder says this look at him they always turn on  there own country when your broke because of the goverment
Always wondered why certain "royals" wear all those medals. You know they weren't out there on the frontlines doing anything for them except a small few perhaps
No inheritance tax paid either!
I appreciate very much your history lesson. Not stuff you are taught in school. That's for sure !
This probably wont be good for the soldier's health.

What is that art behind you? From what I can see of it, it's beautiful. You are also a good looking man.
Time they were all dismissed & just hope they don't exile to Scotland!!!
The British monarchy was taken over along time ago. Right after the french revolution to be exact, when the British King was threatened with the same fate as King Loius, his head on a platter. The King chose his head and relinquished his power. They are figure heads only with no true power. Under the control of forces much larger then them. Those same forces made Briton the financial Capitol of the world and have been responsible for every last war, revolution and depression since. Know thy enemy.
My cousin knows our king very well on a personal and professional level. Much of what is broadcast here is entirely wrong. Don't believe all that is laid in front if you... Incidently, I dispute that Charles is and was unpopular. Long Live the King.  👑
Only one true warrior was in now out of the royal family and that's Harry and I don't blame him one bit, it's about time the British public ditched these out of touch expensive and corrupt  morons and reclaimed their 60 odd castles, estates, country houses etc for the British people. 🥵
Their family lied, cheated, stole and murdered their way into the crown and now they are living off the proceeds of these crimes.
Not my King.
What a knob you sound. Should be ashamed being an ex soldier. You don't like Authority I get it but you come across as really  bitter about something!..who do you want in power some scruff on benefits with 10kids😂God save the king🇬🇧💪
Camilla is just an old hag!  And Charles is just a buffoon!
sounds like jealousy
Is this what this channel has become?  Someone just throwing abuse at whatever is the next Bogeyman... You could get this content, Sat in the back of a London taxi from a bigoted moron.  I remember when this channel was informative!  Un-Subscribed!
And now we know why Harry walked away
Glad to hear there's a few honest Poms that see the truth.
Charlie's uncle Dickie was a one, as was his brother randy Andy. I don't really care about the royals, they live way up in their ivory towers, flunkies telling them what they want to hear. As a vet I found the class system operated by the Senior NCOs and Officers degrading, that with crap pay, condescension and treated like a serf with no thanks for the sacrifices were puke inducing. No wonder vets tell every youngster they meet to not join up.
And French hate French rules
Charles shouldn't be king.nor camila Queen consort
GFY👹👹👹👹👹👹🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🌲
FREEDOM FOR UK 🕊🇵🇸🕊🇾🇪🇧🇷💂👨👳👼🌍👫💃
Definitely Royalties are the biggest zionists and they know how get very rich.
Republic for the U.K.
People should watch the movie omen it's an eye opener
I think they , the uptight "English Royals"; want their past hidden, and jewels and wealth protected and locked up safely. But their infedlities, illegal acts, and discrimination overlooked.
I agree with you 100%.
They pay no tax? Are you sure? For me, the biggest damage with Charles came from his treatment of Princess Diana, born out of his pride and jealousy, and the latest,  publicly supporting the mandated Vax. That showed me just how he has become a corporate capture. An elected Head is just as open to corruption as the institution "Royalty".
No different to the maggot,s involved with the WEF., THE WHO , NATO , ROTHSCHILD,S ,BILDEBERGERS AND ALL THE ELITES THINKING THAT BECAUSE THE HAVE LOT,S OF MONEY [ALLWAY,S GAINED BY ILLEGAL OR IMMORAL PRACTICES] THINK THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO AS I SAY NOT AS I DO . THE FRENCH DID HAD A SOLUTION FOR THAT WHICH WORLD WIDE NEEDS TO BE REVISITED ASAP.
Can anyone talk about why Rishi sunak has been made British pm , their is more to it then it seems. And i am a indian myself.
They hold the country together for now
I like king Charles he has always been a guy who fights climate change the past is the past my friend history has is old news. The Windsor mafia as you say are good in my eyes
Go away Megan lover ,you are as evil as they are,get a life.😡😡😡
I am waiting for the day that Harry or William make a slip of the tongue about the murder of their mum..(probably when dad died).
Spitting out a tirade of chritisism of the monarchy, when you've served under them and with a massive Union Jack on the wall behind you! Really ?
Yeshua Hamashiach is THE ONLY KING! JESUS JEDUS JESUS
Look at Harry who cheated to get into Sandhurst and then spent 10yrs in a bunker playing XBox.  Now he pretends he was a pilot when everybody knows he wasn’t, and wears medals he never earned, and forced us taxpayers to spend £34 million on his wedding to an alleged ex-Pro, when he wasn’t even the heir ffs! Charles (who cheated to get into Cambridge) recently got caught smuggling suitcases of cash across Borders, and like his mother has never paid tax. They have to go!  The lot of them!
Charles trashed any respect I might have had for him by how he treated our Queen of Hearts, Diana.
Look freedom of speech  and i agree with you about Charles and that so called queen  the fact they think the can hurt whoever they can ,their afair with Camilla walking over Diana that he belong to her abd Diana is just a tool for a heir ,they all cold hearted oxygen thiefs ,family life ,real love and respect they dont have ,but i have to say and im not British Wiland his wife really try to make difference, but Charles with his sausage fingers blocked him to do ,with Charles the RF become a utterly disgusting mockery
Like bunker Harry 😊
Prince Harry should be allowed to wear his military uniforms he served and earned the right to wear his uniforms but they were stripped away from him. Not right as his dad brother and uncle all wear them. Harry should not be pubished bt having his uniforms taken away.
History of william de bissopeston…or have they erased that too? Worcestire seat
https://youtu.be/0rIbABnewno?si=12Th9jm7Ac5AQ4Vb
The British government is the most diabolical institution on the planet
spot on buddy
I can't stand the royal family never have ,I see them for who the really are greedy evil disgusting they don't give a dam about people.  Theives they have stolen from all over the realm.
The so called king  is a pervert
Imagine going into a war zone with this creep .if he can defame the king what would he do to save his own ass
Absolutely right we need to do away with the kings and queens of this land. This is not their land. This is our land. They need to be thrown and charged with treason.

There is a lot of truth in what is said here, we should look to places like Holland and Scandinavia where the roya families there try to fit in with ‘the common man” yes it is disgusting that one person is on the street, but most of all its the money thats paid out…this must stop…they are all filthy rich and while we have so many poor (add to that the immigrants who are coming over by the thousands) and the palaces that we apparently own?  Really, it that is the case then we should be able to stay there… Its the absolute wealth and treating us the commoners as dimwits.  Would we be better off with a president, well art least they do not have all the sister and brother and cousins by the dozens being part of the wealth that we pay…its criminal that we pay such high taxes while they live off the fat of the l and, I would have respect if they stopped being so bloody greedy, and the lies, yes we all tell fibs and none of us are perfect, but who the hell pays the charities, its people like us with little money who support the charities…the amount of money they pay into the charities is minimal… compared to what they are given by so called common man….all the land that they own? Apparently even the land our houses are built on they also own that…it’s absorbed, a very small family is all that is need and and the rest need to go out to work like everybody else.they are human and have all the human foibles that we have, adultury, and worse yet still they are shielded and the contempt they have for the stupid people waving their flags and keeping them in luxury…its a crime that we have no choice , they money is taken from us.   How many of us would voluntary pay for their excess’s….nil unless brainwashed
How about David Icke telling us decades ago about the Royals and there appetite for children Diana also mentions this .these aren't human and vicious you will be finding out during this impending military lockdown all about our dear Monarchy 😊
To ME, the REAL PROBLEM has always been those People Who Go and Stand there for HOURS just to Worship those "Royal" Gangsters.
💯
Codswallop - mean spirited jealous - take a look at yourself before you criticise the King!
Wearing phoney medals is childish 😅
HYSTERECTOMY will instantly REMOVE ANY EMOTION FROM CRATE...... and make her an INSTANT REPLACEMENT FOR GERIATRIC ANNE.
Totally agree with everything you say. How did we go from beheading one king to having a biillionair on the throne again ? They absolutely corrupt, insider dealings on the stock market to languishing in abject luxury with other pedophiles. They all need to go.
We need to get rid of the royals
The Windsors are Germans - bludgers all of 'em.
So, one would replace our Royals, by having a Present or Emperor, who, when looking at, are far worse. Be careful for what one wished for !
I believe the Antichrist is King Charles. Why? He is prince, now king, of Wales whose flag has a red dragon. He created the hoax of global warming. He converted to Islam back in the 80s. He has an open door policy to Muslims, his army. He stepped down from authority over the C.O.E. The Queen called him, “The Chosen One.” He possesses a 10 cubit golden winged statue of himself walking on the heads of worshippers; it mocks both God, and the statue on the Ark of the Covenant. It is the statue that will be placed on the temple in Israel. And, quite frankly, he scares the crap out of me.  Proof Islam is the army of Satan:  In the original codex (ancient manuscript in book form) of the Bible, when it talks of the number of the beast, there are three previously unidentified symbols. Those symbols have been translated to either, “616,” or the now generally accepted as truth, “666.” Not so!  They weren’t symbols at all! It was Arabic. An Arab could easily translate those same words today. The number of the beast, those “three symbols,” translates to, in English, “In the name of Allah, crossed swords.”  Islam is the beast, the army of Satan. See the video below if you doubt it.  https://youtu.be/z6U2OVqkF98?si=nJGpE5jvCE4S1i_U
How much is your book? 😂😂😂Power is with the politicians!
King Charles before his mother passed called for the Great Reset and he is a regular of the World Economic Forum who says we will own nothing and be happy and that we will rent everything.
Hm! Presumably at the beginning of your service you swore to be loyal and took the Queens shilling. In my service I came across disgruntled soldiers.
Sir,I truly appreciate you telling the truth!  More exposure to this person,who is as evil as evil can be! He is nothing good about him! He thinks he is the utmost importance of the world and it's really the opposite! Not my king Charles ,is the name I gave him! He is no king   He is a Devil in Sheep's clothing! Thank you for this and I pray he steps down soon or ends the ROYAL PAIN REIGN. HE IS NOT NEEDED IN SOCIETY... MUCH RESPECT TO YOU!!!👌m
I never understood why the British clapping for a parasite family!?
Time, royalty was finished. From another time, belongs in the past. In a word. Parasitesukden
THANKS 🙏 YOU FOR CALLING THEM THE MAFIA
I objected the treaty annuities specific claim settlement agreement. It's accused North America can't do business with unaccountable organization foundation embassy's churches government's kings queens forums Summits anything PLUS it's a pandemic hit laws. It's the same
Jimmy Saville deceived everyone; hospitals & police included!! Without the RF tourism would suffer immensely.  The history & Monarchy r the  #1 reason for people to travel to the UK. It's not for the weather lol.  The RF generate a tremendous amount of REVENUE! U don't 😅
He had his wife Killed!
Yes and dressed up like a Christmas Tree!
I cannot stand Charles, but at the same time I cannot stand ex-forces people who slag off the Royals. The Queen was my boss, I did CP for her and the rest of them when I served my second draft in NI and they returned for the first time in the nineties, and I would've taken one for her not because I'm a Royalist but because that was my job and I volunteered for it-same as you.  I get it that you don't like them now, and I don't like Charles, but you're making yourself look like a wank...
Ah, the profound views of a military deserter whose ex-colleagues consider to be a weak, loathsome individual.
so true
William is his father's son...he is just better at acting than his father... but let's give him a chance. If he screws up, the monarchy should end with him.
Why is putting up a headscarf a bad thing? This silly little racism invalidates your whole argument.
The rich are crazy people, no one should have to work for any royal . They are the old bullies of the old generation.
Well the Queen doesn’t have a mansion in heaven
I so agree with you❤
Its the same here in the Netherlands the same crap royal mafia.
Rob roy
Truth
The only KING I bow down to is King Jesus!
he`s still the King.
Was not Princess Diana's accident "arranged" ??
Charlie the chomo ain’t no king of mine
the royals bring in money but it stays in the royals pockets.we need a robin hood to come soon
Those who live by the sword will die by the sword = Jesus Emannuel Lord of the Universe.
If other country's can do it we can.
but, but people worship him. People want to worship others that are rich and prominent, no matter what their character.
👍👍👍
King, chop 👎
He murdered his beautiful wife diana
Agreed. Btw, reason why my English side left England, over 200 years ago, to America, on The Mayflower… became Puritans… Hence, Disagreed with, The Church of England and The Monarchy.
All Monarchies in Europe should go work daily , and we should stop paying taxes ( for those gansters )  Blood lines of the Reptilians
The FIRM could give every UK citizen £1 Million and not miss it but they'd rather flaunt their wealth and there are still so many U..K.. 'subjects' that worship them. 🤔
Descended from Dracula .....not even joking
Is it possible that Charles will abdicate the throne to William early if he does maybe they should keep an eye on Harry,possibly the way he has been treated by the royal family since he marriage has not sat to well with him to say the least.
BULLSHIT !!!
In Australia . Ex goveror generals private archived papers. Released to public view after an ongoing  10 year FOI court case.Reveals that queen and charles etc all  knew and endorsed overthrow of Oz Prime Minister Whitlam in 70s. Been denied for 45.years . CROOKED.
hewers of wood, drawers of water...   And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.
The Truth is all the poeple or family's we call kings or royal family they are bed people that have kill poeple and grab poeple belongings by force killing poeple in the influence of gree 3:41 d 3:38
Real leaders don’t eat unless the people eat!
NOT SURPRISED  .HE IS THE ANTICHRIST
They are Pure Evil!!! 😎🤗🎉
So truth.All monarchies in the world are parasites, no doubt...🕵️
Those that preach service have been serving only themselves for centuries
Royalty is simply a massive income earner for UK.  It cons the rest of the world to come and see and spend all their money in UK.   You will never get rid of it even if you hate it.    From Australia.
Very interesting. But Cromwell was a bloodthirsty monster with absolute power. His republic was much worse than monarchy, that´s why monarchy survived.
Well done 🤣🤣keep it up,, i could listen to anyone who tells a few home truths about the monarchy,, with the five castles,, and acres of private  land ,,while people with two jobs are being evicted and going to food banks  it really makes my blood boil.
This is truly an amazing video illustrating how the gangsters of this world rule it. This soldier has stated the truth and deserves to be honored for revealing this story.
The monarchy died when the queen passed
Today i queen of Denmark has her last working dag, and her son Frederik becomes king, they are nice people..., but i have often thought as he says this old system the monarci is a monument and symbol of the class system, which do not represent social equality. It don't make my life better og worse because we have monarci, but it sure cost a lot of money, but they are also an income for the country. But there is a dark side to it, all the people of power has their group there so they can make deals with each other, and stay rich and powerful. And to be that means you have a lot of underdogs like normal people, and our leaders do not like the dictators, communist and other govern systems. .
I've been saying all of this for decades.
Yeah, it sucks for you guys that ol Cromwell was just as big of a tick as ol Chucky the First was. Just remember, elected heads of state can be just as corrupt as royal families. I know,  I'm American. The corruption is effing unbelievable here. Like I said, I don't have a dog in this hunt cause I'm not British, but I think y'alls current Chucky is a big fat tick. Ticks are parasites, y'know. Lots of love and luck to all y'all across the pond!❤
CHARLES WILL STEP DOWN ..🔴 BUT WILLIAM WILL NOT BE KING ❗ CHARLES FIRST BORN SON SIMON HE HAD WITH CIMILIA  WHEN YOUNG TEENS ..WILL TAKE THE THRONE WITH HIS WIFE AS QUEEN ..🔴 THEN IT ALL CRUMBLES DOWN ❗🔴
Love of royalty is definitely linked to intelligence. Low or high? I have my opinion, and you have yours.
He murdered his mum?         And he is the anti christ?
Dump the hippacrites.
I'm an ex-vet mate and I can tell you he's not my king period.
Be careful what you wish for, you might actually get it, Commie.
Crimes against humanity in Canada.. They took children and they were never seen again.. Indigenous children. They are all a scourge upon this earth and the International Court will be dealing with Charles. They have no Royal Accent no privy council.. We are not dead under law of sea.. We are Sovereign Canadian Nationals under the law of the land. Take back your Sovereignty. ☝️💜🙏💜
I can't believe that the British people still look up to this crap
I want to look up what 'common wealth' actually was supposed to mean because it isn't for common people. Stand up.
What? No mention of the Peasants' Revolt of 1381?
Royalty died when Diana died in my book
I saw a a video made by one of your historians. The show this particular people are really a branch off of an illegitimate Lion King Edward I think the 5. I think it was just King Edward and his wife went I don't know I get some kind of crazy war and he went three weeks beyond where she stayed but she laid with a royal archman she got pregnant and the King knew it what is an ass and she had to sign papers to state that. Hey my darn sure the second child was his and that child was to be king he would he was taught to take the throne. The King die. And the Queen set up her ill-gotten child who grew up with any instructions. Believe it called Real Royal  something like that, for a time, they pull it down . But I believe it's back. The true King Michael pass away in 2023. He was a love person. He knew who was...he had his family tree. The same as the historian. When he was 17 he moved Australia. Two beautiful daughters and a granddaughter, grandson. He nice way was not interested in the royals.😊
I'll pray for you as I believe these Psychopaths may try to remove you.
The "Winsors" are the German House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, England is run by a German "royal family".
Un vrai journaliste  Quand vous voyez Kate Middleton cheffe d un regiment c est du n.importe quoi  Pourquoi ne pas donner cet engagement a un vrai militaire  Vous voyez cela ne me genera pas si demain Eleonor des Asturies soit cheffe d un groupe militaire car elle au moins a fait des classes  Vous rendez vous compte on a enlevé tous ses titres.et honneurs au Prince Harry lui qui a servi  10ans dans l armee anglaise et vous voyez les autres porté fièrement des médailles non meritées  Les américains ont eu raison d élever le Prince Harry ce que les britanniques ont refusé de faire honte à eux  Le monde voit cette injustice et POURQUOI  Le Prince Harry a voulu juste une vie simple et libre il n avait pas demandé de naître Prince  Pourquoi certaines personnes pensent gerer la vie des autres Bravo au Prince Harry pour son courage sa détermination sa vision df la vie sa philanthropie son humanisme merci Prince Harry
Read the book by Tim Cohen called the antichrist and a cup of tea. It reveals how King Charles III has all the attributes and characteristics of the man described in the Bible to be the one who enslaved the whole world and will cause everyone to take the mark. True darkness in this King. There is a second edition coming out soon with even more proof that Charles is this future figure that will enslave all humanity
I understand them wearing Military uniforms, however the Medals i really take issue with.. especially if they haven't served and done anything for them. I'd be interested to see what these medals were issued for..
Please Repent to THE LORD JESUS CHRIST befor its tolate.....the antichrist is comming and the 666!!! Reed the Bibel....the rapture is going to happen!!!
Phil the Greek & sausage fingers Charlie were great mates with Jimmy Saville & Randy Andy was besties with Epstein...That should tell you all you need to know about that lot.
Stop being a traitor - who do you want to govern our country  some some member of hamas supported by Iran?
Their wealth, for the most part, was stolen just like their Valor.  It's been this way in the United States as well.  They bleed us dry.  Every generation from both sides of my family was not poor.  They worked good jobs, farmed the land, and did other odd jobs for extra income.  There is never anything monetarily substantial to pass on to the next generation.  It's a dang shame when there was a family plot purchased years ago in New York, and the state taxes you $5000 to open the ground tax... for your 97 year old grandmother.  They didn't dig it open, mind you , I had to pay the funeral home to do that.   All these public servents are con artists, deceivers, and thieves that bare a Title of Nobility.  Maybe that's why men should not bare title.
Those GROOMING GANGS get away with everything and the whole country doesnt care……….
WE OPPOSE GLOBALIST CAPITALISTS, INTERESTED IN LIBERTY, EQUALITY. WE WANT MORE SOCIAL, inCOME, ECONOMIC EQUALITY. AMERICAN CORPS PAY TOO MUCH AND SUCK THE TALENT IN ANY NATION. BESIDES, THEY INTRODUCE SALARY/INCOME INEQUALITY AND THE PRICES GO UP.
Joe, I'm pretty sure I heard you speak some years ago in Conway Hall.
I've watched this 3 times now and all I can say is BRILLIANT! The anti feudal revolution wasn't completed thoroughly. You correctly pointed out the land question and the vast regions of land which the monarchists hold as private property. The monarchy has vast regions of land and property across the world as well as in the UK (and in Ireland of course).
Well said!
Good lad. Well done and well said!
RISE UP EUROPE.  ❤
Hes Says He is Christ the savor of the world this evil Charles.  Greed selfishness Agenda  he already fell
If the royal family is so Christian that they never miss church..why aren't they forgiving of Harry and Meghan??? Forgiveness is of God and who he is yet they eminate bitterness and cold shoulders towards their own blood family.  Hypocrites all of them no matter how well they dress. King or no king he's wrong as is William.  A big farce is the monarchy. It should be dissolved completely because they're not worthy of their titles.
Yes most of the world problems were instigated by European royal family for over a 1000 years
The time has come for these people to go.  They are shockingly disgraceful.
They were placed here , for a role to play all intermarried , pay no taxes to pay for them , utter rubbish, not my king
Never was Monarchy...was a mafia .. fuelled by rubbing true Monarchs...and the populations of true Monarchs .. And churches who find it easy to make money...so church orthodox..is the main issue.
STOP...The British economy would suffer if you dismissed the Monarchy.     Tourism is based on people wanting to see the pomp and ceremony.  How many jobs would be cut?  All the horses, the riders, hotels, the memorabilia, restaurants, waiters etc etc.      There is no great industry in England. Without the tourism and Monarchy England would be a dull European Country not worth visiting.    History;  the Monarchy is wealthy independently and can live comfortably for generations.      Maybe just become a socialist, marxist country...then you will want your Monarchy Back.
I had great respect for the Queen as she upheld christianity. Charles not a patch on her. Now shes gone only decent Royals are Anne and William and Kate
... understand the various frustrations but no system is perfect
It amazes me that my fellow Aussies want to support these parasites on society they've ruined every culture they've come in contact with.
TRAITORS FAKE NEWS STIRRING UP HATRED.
Always been reluctant of Charles becoming King.. I'm no loyalist but, at least the Queen was ok.
If you thought that then why did you except the kings or Queens shilling, you weigh - anchor.
The REAL king of England lives in Australia. Ivan Talbot. He is the legitimate king to the British throne and has proven it. Research him guys. He’s on Richard vobes channel
Royalty are parasites
CHARLES IS THE ANTICHRIST !
Their not Windsors at all their NAZIS  their real name is  SAXE-COBURG-GOTHA
It is a weird thing how most people if they were true to themselves, admit they don't agree with the idea of a monarchy while at the same time refuse to attend the royal functions. Let the royal family show up with nobody (regular population) staying home - if the functions were boycotted, they would get the message. Not convinced they would care.
Plz people give the throne to harry it should be kind harry hwo carrys hes mums amazing heart and spirit i wont work with evil little charles but i will gladly work with king harry 😊❤❤
the priciples of tribe fuedalism is a basic mis nomer they are inbred liars to boot never ending conflict is an alcoholic/psychotical hole we are basically peaceful /majority not DEMOCRACY .
You'll have that with a secret society of pedos. Your monarchy is just the tip of the ice berg to say! They spread there cult all over the known world in the 1800s
The Royal family needs to go none of them have done anything for the people of England they don't help the homeless all they do is look down on people why are they not helping get the homeless a place to live or open soup kitchens and shelters for people  to stay warm for the winter but they only care about clothes and feeding there own faces the concubine Camilla needs to stop shoveling so much food from her pig trough
Here in America the Bidens think they are royalty.
Pull yourself up by the boot straps and go to work! If you don't like your lot in life only you can make that change. Stop complaining just do it. There are many millionaires that stared their fortune from the bottom are rose to mass a fortune. Now this is capitalism!
You are ridiculous. The British people would never be happy with a Republic. And a traitor like you does not wash well in any circumstance, be it a monarchy, a republic, or a brothel.
New subscriber, USA. Irish, Scottish heritage. Thank you for enlightening us with interesting facts. Happy, healthy, & prosperous New Year!
You are telling lies here, you know that the Royal Family brings much more money to this country than they cost. Can you imagine how many people would come to this country if there was not a Royal Family, a lot less I would tell you. You disgrace yourself as a person, all you can do is spread misinfromation and hate. What do you do, other than receiving money to insult and defame the Royal family?
I am one of the people that you call a moroon. Between me and you if there is a moroon here, it is not me.
You are a traitor and an attention seeker. If you are really a military, one of those that honours our country with their work, you have sworn your loyalty to the Queen / King. So, now you come here to betray your oath?
Avsatanic ritual olayed out during the coronation of Prince Charles....he isnt following the Spirit of God,ir the Holy Spirit... He filliws the Antichrist spirit of rebellion.   .
The world knows how bad Charles is he deserves nothing he’s an arrogant rude uncaring un empathetic man.  Hes selfish and gets everything he wants no matters who he hurts to get it. The only people that like him are the same as him👍  Charles has done to many unforgivable things in the publics eyes👍
The king is a globalist
He's not for the people
Il sausage fingers ancestries had a lot of mine be headed , free Brans heart ❤
I thought all this time you were describing the Prime Minister 😆. Any one in power either was beheaded killed or kicked out. It’s what power does to a human being. They killed the king in France and what did they get? An Emperor. So who would you like to get? An angel?
and Andy is a nonse , protected by his big brother....why?
"for god and the king"  both institutions are man made
I have said for years...if a royal family was a good idea...the Americans would have bought one.
their name isnot windsor, they only adopted that in ww1 because they had a german name Saxe Coburg Gotha...who are these german people in charge of our so called democracy,they stay in power no matter who we minnions elect.
They got to the top because their ancestors were ruthless, ha ha can you imagine chas being ruthless.....he couldn't fight his way out a wet paper bag!Time for this expensive and useless institution "the firm" to go and all their sycophantic followers to find a new religion.....and god is like santa...he doesn't exist.   FACT.
All clowns mentioned are cowards. They dare not walk in usa  alone, unarmed......come visit me
The most boring video ever
Listen to you man your a soldier You were the dog on all fours now your wagging your tail right mate...
People forget that Robin Hood was working for king Richard and prince John just snuck and took over when king Richard fought the crusades Robin Hood was a good man fighting the tyranny that transpired
Makes me sick too Just look around the world Them at the top wear medals for what nevered served their country
Robber Baron.
I think king or prince charles has exposed himself enough. Leave the royals alone...they're nothing more than rich, over indulged trash.
The royals are grifters
Fret not my dear man remember the words of Jesus Christ 🎉 The1st shall come last and last will come 1st 🥇 for eternity rejoice for they had their inheritance, your is yet to come Good Sir 👑 your a king 👑 in paradise!
Hello Jo, just to ask a fellow Soldier from Dalton Bks how do we go about trying to hold thoes responsible for sending us to Iraq and Afganastan on a lie? How to do we get Tony Blair up in court for crimes against humanity? How do we get the truth out of why we went in to these places? How do we get enough of us together to bring this about?
Lydon wrote. “I’ve got no animosity against any one of the royal family. Never did. It’s the institution of it that bothers me and the assumption that I’m to pay for that. There’s where I draw the line. It’s like, ‘No, you’re not getting ski holidays on my tax.’”  Lydon also reflected on the Sex Pistols’ anthem “Anarchy in the U.K.,” “Anarchy is a terrible idea. Let’s get that clear. I’m not an anarchist. And I’m amazed that there are websites out there – .org anarchist sites – funded fully by the corporate hand and yet ranting on about being outside the shitstorm. It’s preposterous.”
chales is a WEF muppet and doesnt give a damn about poor people
Kings, Queens and Princes/Princesses ONLY EXIST IN FAIRY TALES !!!!!!!!!!
Where was charles when the british people were getting jabbed with experimental drugs that defiled all of the Nuremburg codes?
The leader of the English church who reduced the 10 commandments to 8 and has his ass licked by the rest of the religious farce in support .
The monarchy is an out dated institution and needs to be removed. All those assets should go to and for the people
Wel said. He has even got fat fingers. If the French people can survive without them, why not us.
And now France is virtually !slamic.  Yeh, their revolution really helped them out didn’t it………..What have they got now in their wonderful Republic, apart from endless rioting, looting, violence, rape and murder?  Their successive Marxist Governments have systematically destroyed it!
As a Canadian, I never understood the rationale behind the admiration for the royals.  I’ve always felt they are pretty useless.  And now I’m just disgusted by the King and his evil ways.
This reminds me of the God Father, but the royals aren't as Nice as the Corleone's.
The last good British king was Henry the 5th.
The great thing about this country is the fact that people can voice their views without being dragged off to the Tower or murdered
I think we need a new robin hood for thw ppl ❤
hER mAJESTY The Misfit .....
He stinks just like the rest of the royal family....
At last someone who is awake! The royal family are the most successful crime family in history.  I haven't ever been comfortable with our military been their body guards.the armed forces should only serve the people in my opinion.
The real British people aren't complaining are they?K's mother.
Word.
Cromwell days were bloody.  He was a tyrant even towards ordinary people.  Not all French are proud of their Revolution born in blood.  Most people murdered then were simple people. Check facts before speaking.  Republic is no utopia either.  The perfect system is not of this world. Although i agree the image of royalty in Britain is totally spoilt.
thank you for your video, gotta agree we have no need of royals or betters, we are all equal, we just need to believe it
Bravo
During the crowning they covered over Charles why, literally witchcraft live on TV and the church of England allowed this.
Don't worry God Sees Everything. Even the mighty will fall. Sin (greed) has temporary gains. Goodness Surely prevails in time! ❤👑
Charles is doomed and so is his son whose wife will be coronated which I predicted 10 years ago. A king on the throne is the most detrimental ideal that threatens the Matriarchy that works behind the scenes in the world. His sons would scoff at this statement but when Charles is gone soon you may actually get to live to see Harry grow a pair and start taking things serious when his lights finally turn on. By the time William does it will be too late.
I have a copy of Epsteins "Black Book". Guess who's in there OTHER than Andrew. Wingnuts ancestors were thieves, rapists, bullies, and murderers. The Krays tried it and they were put inside. "Royalty" doesn't like competition.  GB REPUBLIC NOW.
Light will reveal th darkness🙏 There true history reveals absolute darkness
As long as people tolerate them....they will continue to act superior and live the high life...they are not rpyal just people who have fooled the masses. People are waking up.
Time someone spoke truth.
Charlie's not jn charge of himself. What King allows Rockefeller to poke his pointed finger into a King's chest, while Charlie's looking to the ground like a forlorn child being told off. See the pic if it's still around.
Oh boo boo. You're and your ilk are just pissed that you are not them!! Get a life!!!
I like the false little image the royals give....but they dont need all that money in order to do this... if they got real jobs this would be even more inspiring... i do think a country benefits from non celebrity, non political role models aka royals... but only if they  have pristine morals and family lives... the only good royals are the ones that are related to diana, or that red hair gal...and of course those related to kate.. but the rest seem pretty haineous... peddo's , killers etc...  otherwise celebrities and politicians will do the job..
" I REVERE ISLAM AND CELEBRATE THE MASSIVE CONTRIBUTION THAT MUSLIMS HAVE MADE AND CONTINUE TO MAKE TO BRITISH SOCIETY,  I INTEND TO BE KING OF ALL THE FAITHS."    Traitor King Charles ( February 2023)
Without this old system we should not have any palaces with historic treasures. People who live within those walls of history take care of it for coming generations. They leave everything when they die as we all do. Old castles is history as well as Six pistols. Those are things that makes a piece of land to a country. I think there should be something that stands for stability even if it might seems a bit strange sometimes. People seems to seek comfort in religion because it stands for stability in a hard life. Conservative ideology is about that. I myself as a non believer can see how this can became a safe harbour for many people. The old titles also stands for stability and identity.  History of man is also history of war. It is a really messy thing. But actually we live in the best of times today. Even so we have many urgent things to solve. Royal family is not one of them. The frontier of today stands in Ukraine. We should support what is right and not fall for evil communist lies. We must stand strong and consolidated. We must know who is our real enemy. We fight against an imaginary ghost called climate change. This is a scam that eventually will destroy our democratic nations. We must all educate our self and be responsible. We need old fashion common sense.
... never did like any of the "so called royals" especially king Charlie,  thet're nothing more than a TAX BURDEN to the average people.
The king is too weak to rule. If the king was strong , Meghan Markle ,Harry, and prince Andrew would all be held accountable for their actions, and they are not.
Jimmy Savilles mate.
Soooooooo true! End this ridiculous relic of a lifestyle from history . Why do you people kiss up to these grifter’s? It’s nuts! Especially this vile gang! Elite globalist….yuck! Charlie had sus friends!
Mate, you are just gossiping like you is down the pub talking No evidence or facts just your opinion. 😅.
I agree with you 100% people need to wake-up and turn their eyes on jesus.
You're 100% right! 👏🏼
Good to see someone in England is waking up to the corruption of the Royal family as they are gangsters over the past few hundred years they have stolen everybody’s land often, and now they text them to live on their own land and have ridiculous amount of taxes and utilities more than any other country I know that’s why I left England in 1966 that’s when it started to get worse The only thing is the war family is controlling Australia and was slowly following suit
‘Merica
Who on earth still needs these CROWN FAMILIES???? This is so out of date, no one interessted i these old fashion families!  They are not there to interfere in our politics. I dont see why people should pay taxes for them either, they wine and dine in the best upperclass Restaurants on the backs of struggling working people! Away with them!
Well Done Mate.
Are you taking picc . Doctors nurses teachers and train drivers who are on more than £50.000 a rear . Don't tell me there as struggling.
Antichrist and a cup of tea… good book
Sounds to me like you'd be far happier in Soviet Russia. However, as that no longer exists, you may want to try North Korea, or possibly China for a kind of leadership that suits you more.  DO you honestly think that a different un-elected leader under a red flag would be better? Maybe you'd like to see the UK being run like the USA? Cus, for the last decade or so, they have been doing a fantastic job of electing leaders..... Not.
"Military Cosplay"
The Commonwealth is worth nothing then ? Unfortunately some have acted badly and some like Charles are decietful, but not all. Its about getting the best out of them.
If I could recommend, that you will note that the Communists, always  use jealousy to manipulate people.  The Royalty like  people who own the Central Banks, all inherited massive amounts of money.  I suggest you be glad for them and move on.  You will be much happier and there is nothing you can do about it. Of course we  do have the problem where both the Central Banks and Royalty abuse their power, then is when we should stand up.
I'm Canadian and I never wanted monarchy and today's the reason why. Chucky is not my King, Jesus is! Chucky doll wants to steal every square inch of land from Canadians and turn us into his serfs? I got news for Chucky doll! Over our dead bodies! It's bad enough money is stolen from Canadians annually to this monarchy in taxes of more than 55million but not a bloody chance does he get one square inch of Canada. He's done! Hit the road, Chucky doll!
Please be protected, they mustn't silence you, may God bless you ❤
The British monarch and Rothschilds captured America covertly through the Freemason lodges in America so yeah about that😅
You are a very brave guy. I fully agree with you, The RF have flashed  their wealth,  most of wh8ch, we, the tax payer copped for. What did we get  in return that grifter  and idiot prince lied and insulted  us in return. Good on you young man, keep snapping at their heels., and speaking for the ordinary man in the  street.
Robin hood they are robbing bastards
Is he behind Diana's death?
The Americans never shut up about the revolution because a bunch of farmers and average citizens, with a newly organized militia having very little money and weapons, beat a country that had been around for over 800 years, had all the wealth of royalty and the strongest navy in the world, not just in the Revolutionary War, but every time Great  Britain came back and stirred up small wars in America.
There was a smaller revolution in England during the middle ages led by a man called Wat Tyler. It ended after the crown agreed to meet the leaders of the revolt but it was an ambush and all the leaders were murdered.
Wa wa wa and? Quit crying about it.
Brilliant 😊
We need a republic.
Well said! John Lydon is the mate. Thank you, for your service! ✊🦁
Bring me a bigger jock, shouted the king, for what little there was to hide.
This guy is a very good orator. Good clip!
not my King
Charles is the Antichrist. Read “ The Antichrist and a cup of tea”
I WANT TO LIVE IN A WORLD WITH KINGS, QUEENS, PRINCES AND PRINCESSES. IT’S A PART OF OUR WORLD HISTORY AND I AM HERE FOR IT!
I agree with your point of view. All the dressing up and no guts or conscience or compassion. Then there are questions about Savile and Diana screaming to be answered. Charles is more than likely the head of the Freemasons/Illuminati/Globalists. That's why he is such an apologist. Strange how neither he nor the late queen ever aplogised for the thousands of Afrikaner women and children who died in British concentration camps during the Boer War in South Africa. No apoligy. No restitution.. Thousands of our people were killed. What a hypocrite.
Kings bestie was savile, kings bro was a reg at pedo island , uncle a convited pedo NOT much to be proud of or celebrate .................... It's Revolution time me thinks shame the masses are soy sheep.
Blame the rich . You are just a small minded class war whinger .
Never liked nor trusted Chuck loathe Camilla  Abdicate Chucky your disgusting an a criminal
This should be removed from the web.  This man is out of his tiny mind!  Jealousy is at the root of his rant.  As an English woman, I totally deplore his rant and efforts to destroy the King's reputation.  He is totally ignorant of the many acts of generosity and kindness that King Charles does quietly, and unpublished.  Shame on this dreadful man.  My Dad gave his life for England in World War II and I deplore this man's wicked and untrue comments.  Remove this from the web, please.
Knob.
My favorite statement by Charles is, "You will have nothing and be happy." Coming from someone who is above having his stuff taken, it is quite distrubing. Put him on the front lines with no priviledge and no tent. Let him sleep in holes with his soldiers, like they have to.
😂 the Bible says woe to them that say good as evil and evil is good and yes God hates all liars so whoever is a liar is the father of lies which is the devil and if you love lies then God says I'll send you a strong delusion that you might believe a lie so that you all might be damn because you love 💕 🙏 so thank God for truth amen 🙏💕😊
👍👏👏👏👏
Envy seems to be the main ingredient here, What should have been the major topic is the Royal Families huge Political Involvement with the WEF, a Tyranical Org out to Destroy the World !!
Fantastic Joe, brilliant comments
Our problems run deeper than the Royal Family. Your right Charles doesn't deserve respect. But our problems are deeper, channel your anger towards the real danger.🇬🇧
¿I heard  that the family changed their  name to Winsor during WWII in order to hide the German heritage?
Well, the royals are the children of those who attacked and conquered the Anglo-Saxons and the others of these island.
Sad and bitter take on the role of monarchy in Britain…. Look closer to home at your parliament
He killed his mummy!!!
The Brit regals just collect money from others and people think that they are dipping into their pockets for this. How disgusting
Lets not mention the child trafficking and pedophilia  along with the SRA .
Well said 👏👏 don't forget parliament 😉🫡
Why do they still follow a king or queen
Holy shit they are just cos playing
The whole concept of "royalty" is ridiculous, anybody supporting this farcical bullshit needs their heads examined.
Charles has never shown any sign of being intelligent. He has been taken in by these politicians who use 'human caused' Climate Change to raise taxes and make money for themselves from contracts linked to climate change 'problems'. There might well be Climate Change but man has little to no affect on it. Climate Change has occurred since the world began and long before humans existed.
Double Down News With respect, you are not "exposing" anything just voicing YOUR own opinion which may differ from that of others so please use correct titles to describe your rant.  thank you 😊
Stollen Valor, pathetic.  What can you expect from him after he told everyone to take coffee enemas? That is the British equivalent of telling the public to go fu*k themselves.
Hundreds of millions of pounds for Charles' Monty Python Drag Queen show was discussing.  He repeated the show at the opening of Parlaiment dressed like a fool. Lipstick on a pig.
Charles had potential anti-monarchy demonstrators ARRESTED before they even demonstrated on the day he was crowned. He took away British citizen's right to free speech! If the British people do not act against him, they deserve to lose free speech, sadly.  Guess it is always the same with them, pretend it never happened.
The leaders of the Enlightenment were not especially democratic, as they more often look to absolute monarchs as the key to imposing reforms designed by the intellectuals. Voltaire despised democracy and said the absolute monarch must be enlightened and must act as dictated by reason and justice—in other words, be a "philosopher-king".
Done with royalty and especially that fake Queen. The head of the snake resides in Buck palace.
They don’t have any power! They are figureheads! Royals work hard on diplomacy, state occasions supporting charities, there are richer people who do far less at least Charles cares about the environment -funny how no one criticises Diana even though she was a royal and aristo
A referendum on whether to replace the Royal Family with a Head of State might be a pointer to what the public really want. Perhaps this process could at least be debated in Parliament and appropriate follow up actions taken.
I fully agree with Joe Glenton and the anti-royalist position portrayed here. Many members of the British royal family are subhuman and Charles is one of them I believe, as were his parents and grand mother. More exposure to come ...
Unfortunately France now has Macron as the President who is a Dictator, he is the complete opposite of what a republic should be.
1776
Was it 1066 the Runnymead charter?
0oooooo. Charecter assasinations require official.proof my lad
Just look how the royalty treat each other ,that will answer your questions .😅
The new King is an undignified traitor to his own country!
OMG, how true you speak. My husband is a Falklands veteran and is proud of his service,but what you say really resonates with me,as a military wife. Bless you for speaking up.👍🏼
any man that has his wife knocked off in the way she was warned and made public herself many years prior.. and gets away with it is beyond shocking
I'm ex Irish guard and I totally agree with what your saying mate there all 33 degree freemasons and Satan worshippers make me sick I can't believe I wasted 7 years of my life in the army what madness it is, The country has become a joke
He begged Ciril Ramaposa...for grean land ..and protection ...what the fu*c
The new world order is falling ...Long does not live the king
Scotland is the only Country in the world that does not want Independence??????
I am was adopted by a freemasonry family, I have a picture for my grandma shaking the late Queen’s hand . 😮 This has always made me wonder what the deal was ?
Brother, I'm Canadian, and Charles is NOT, MY, king or head and not by a long shot. I've been saying for ages, that I feel the Office of Governor General, should be Canada's proper and official Head of State, but brainwashed Canadians simply, cannot see the sense in this. Next to nothing would need to change as far a our Governing Structure would go, only that the Governor General would take over the role that the monarch currently, holds. No more, no less.   I had some small, interest in the monarchy when Diana was alive, and where she seemed to be trying to take it, but after her death, no. Not in the least. And her sons so far, do not seem to be following in her footsteps all that well. Harry claims to have walked away from it, we'll have to wait and see how he turns out without their influence brainwashing his every waking hour.   My Best. Best of the New Year. Out.
The Royals are a relic of the past and represent everything that needs to be changed in the present – that is - vast inequalities, entrenched inherited privilege - support of and profiting from imperialist wars, murders of foreign leaders (including one of their own Princes Diana) and theft of other countries' resources and an affinity towards racism and Nazism to name a few.
Here we go again all creeping out of the woodwork  I too served my country..with pride.. By what you say All our Royals are so obnoxious…Go live in someone else’s country  Goodbye
King Charles is the Antichrist!!!!! Read 'the antichrist and a cup of tea' by Tim Cohen!!! There's also a free pdf download link on google
Cosplay, thats a good one.
I like this guy's contents. 💯✔️
"The Americans will NEVER shut up about their revolution!"    LOL     ...... nor should they
Id of said the drunks 🥴  they the most arrogant and do the most damage to society.
I'm so pleased to hear you say these things, every country is fixing to find out what it feels like to be free, when God gets through with them, and it's coming soon. God Bless you brother.
You ask where are these voices now they’re all too scared to come to the front of the crowd anymore because they’re all under the microscope everything we think everything we say everything we do is recorded England, or particularly London has more CCTV than anywhere else in the world. Poor old freedom is something of the past where we go from here I’ve no idea and I’m glad I won’t be around to see it.
The monarchy must be abolished!!!!
They are not full blooded British! They have a made up name from a German  name to Windsor.
Gangsters have a way of charming their way to high positions only to enforce an oppressive regime later. It isn't England alone. America has and is suffering from the wrong people in office.
Have thought this for years; especially after the level of cruelty shown by Charles and Camilla toward Princess Diana.
Chuckie is the worst sexual predator...more than Andrew.   Chuckie always brought kids to castle and sexually demolished them so badly they would ultimately try to jump out of the windows naked to escape his savage sexual behaviour.  I truly am saddened that he was so happy when his Mom died. CHUCKIE IS EVIL TO THE CORE!😮
When will they dethrone his useless ass.
There hasn't been a legitimate monarch from England since William took the throne on December 25th, 1066.
The REAL King & Queen live a Modest life in Austrailia  Prove me Wrong . They are Nothing but Pedophiles all part of Epstein's Island. And remember Epstein was Kates Uncle and where Her & Will Honeymooned . And we mustn't forget the 10 Children taken from a Native School In Kamloops BC Canada by Mom & Dad  Betty & Philip in 1964  never to be seen again , Not even a Shoe. Shall we mention the Fellow Climbing Naked out the palace window on Tied bed sheets. Who was he Running from and Why was he Naked and in FEAR? They are like the Movie Damian The Demon Seed.
They stole the crown
I don't understand why do British people keep these lazy Royal Family up? Alot of tax money could be used to help the common working people.
And they are all free stone builders are they not?
As you know, in 1917 the British royal family  changed their surname from Saxe-Coburg Gotha to Windsor  in an attempt to hide their German ancestry. And in 1936, when Edward VIII abdicated the throne, it saved Britain from having a pro-Nazi king who spoke perfect German with his beloved Adolf Hitler.  (It was the language spoken at home with his German mother Ann of Keck and his half German father). Of frighteningly low intelligence, secretive, spoiled rotten, thoroughly screwed up, that is the "Windsors." Mount a guillotine at Hyde Park corner (ha ha, just kidding, of course).
Look what happens to unchecked republics like America and Ireland.
We like the Royal Family and want to keep it.Elizabeth was the Queen all my life.Takes time to get used to the the King.
But didn't the French accept the pirates called politicians and the EU as their royal family and are now suffering even worse?
Charles is an anti Christ .
More ya look the weirder it gets
Hope the public wake up as well 😊
Another club of Rome climate fearing WEF communist
At least Andrew and Harry actually served .the rest don’t deserve the medals
Jimmy Savilles mate.
Wonderful Don. Totally agree. 😊
Charles is a big wig on the NWO and they want us all dead .Awful Man .
Totally agree .I would NEVER dock my hat to that lot .
I am 76 tears old and i would not swear an alegences  to charles ever  he is not my king his alegences  are to the WEF  and The WHO   they are both evil organisations  who want to do harm to the people of the world we need to show rishy sunack  that will will fight for our freedom and it won't  be taken away by thses two criminal  organisations   and the so called king charles
based 🕶👍🏻
Our late Queen actually created these monsters with her own fair hands.
History tells us all communism doesn’t work, and never will. You don’t alleviate poverty by robbing the Rich and giving to the poor. Division of wealth is a mirage. You’re barking up the wrong castle, it’s Government and the corporations that are strangling the British taxpayer, as we speak with this mass migration slave trading strategy to reduce the British people to servitude serfdom and poverty.
Rishi Sunak for president, good luck with that 😂
While our military veterans lie in the streets begging a meal this fraud rakes in billions, time UK wised up and used it's fighting men in a more productive manner.
Hell stirs herself waiting in great anticipation for the king and his elk. He's going to burn in Hell for ever for rejecting Jesus.
The Royal Family is nothing more than the richest welfare family in the world.
A totally facile analysis of the role of the Monarchy.
Dork of the year award goes to this hack journalist. Mate. Move to France if you hate the UK so much.
I would support this, if the Far Left would accept, Islamist are problematic to British Law. Sharia Law is dangerous. Why doesn't the far left oppose this. Muslim in the main generally do not integrate. They never will. They God won't allow it. Sharia Law is the only ultimate way for them and you can't ever change that no matter how hard you try.
Have seen several people linking Charlie with the antichrist. I guess eventually we find out. I wanted to add that the revolution history is no longer taught in the US, at least only a very minor mention if it is. They've slowly been brushing history under the rug here.
The Church of England was founded on divorce. The jewels were stolen. They're really German but changed their name.  Rife with pedos....Chuckles was great friendswith Jimmy Savile.
The Bible says Satan is a Conqueror who goes onto Conquor. The King is a Colonizer who goes onto Colonize. There is only one true King. Satan wants to be like the most High, so he would call himself what, a King. The Pope your False Profit. Militarys of this World defend them. Bible says St. Michael wages War with the Militarys of this World. Now, who you pledge your Allegiance too. Whole lot of people going to Hell on Alligence to Evil alone
It's also a complete lie that they don't have power. They have a great deal of power and VETO is still being used. Elizabeth vetoed a shit tonne of important bills that were going to be passed, then it was hidden that they did.
If they was gangster type you wouldn't dare say anything lol
Bravo . . .. . . . .another that comprehends that secret societies and mystery schools are what started the " nobility " scam . . . . . now we just have too teach them that slave masters should never be voted for . . . . . . . . . YOU WILL NEVER VOTE YOUR " SAVIOR " IN . . . . . . . .all you are doing is voting who should be your abuser . . . . .. . WTFU !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nothings changed since medieval times
They have german lineage as well. They chose the windsor name to not be associated with Germany.
Maybe it's time to dismantle the fantasy land charade and move on ???
This soldier has every right to express his views,about Charles, I always believed that Charles was a spoilt brat who needed a good slap. Personally I have no time for any member of the Royal Family and I certainly can't stand that bloody hippocrite Middleton and her Donkey teeth husband .
King Charles   👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎 I have no further interest in the royal family. When Queen Elizabeth passed, that was the END of the dynasty as far as I'm concerned. Now, it's just  NASTY  !
Are the Masons still doing their funny handshakes?
I did not watch the coronation I don't like the monarchy it's a joke just like other high ups. They are revolting the royal family needs to end.
A fortuneteller said,Charles will die in March, 2026. He predicted the Queen's death on 8 September 2022.
Hi! Thank you for your video! I am German and love Britain - people and country - for decades. But I despise the Royal Family (except Diana). Lots of Greetings!
ORDER OF GARTER awarded to RINCE PANDREW
supposedly king Charles is the anti-christ. in case u havent seen the evidence.
How many people died in the civil war. How many women were widowed?. How many  children were left fatherless and if we have another civil war it wouldnt be with pikes and musket but with machine guns atom bombs a nd biological weapons.  The bloodiest battle ever fought on british was battle. Of towton in an earlier xivil wR the wars of the roses. Any moddetn. Revolution would mKe towto  look like a sunday school picnic.   The people most affected by it would be wo.en children the derly and disabled. No thanks id rather have nonarchy.😊
Every piece of legislation that is produced by the English government needs Royal approval before it can become law. It's insider trading on a grand scale which allows the Royal family to buy or dump stocks before every law is passed. The Royal family enjoyed this priveledged right not only in England but every country of the Commonwealth. Interesting word isn't it. In every event the Royal family has profited financially and become the richest people in the world..  Enough is too much. Let's evolve into a free people
Yeah brother lets look forward to the day when Charlie comes back as a tampon
WHAT HAPPEN TO THE BABY THAT WAS IN THE BREATHING LUNT KING ALBERT JUNIOR... I HEARD THE STORY ABOUT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH NUNS KID NET HIM. THEY IN LOS ANGELES CALIFORNIA DID IT AGAIN THEY THOUGHT THEY CAN KILL ME. I WAS PROTECTED OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN AND HIS SON JESUS CHRIST. I AM A PENTECOSTAL  PULL OF HOLY GHOST TO MY SCOTTISH BROTHER AND SISTER IN JESUS NAME I KNOW THAT THESE CATHOLIC CHURCHES LOBBIES WANT TO KILL ME BECAUSE I WOULD HEAR THEM BECAUSE THEIR MY ENEMIES...
The House of Saxe Coburg and Gotha
The Bible says in these last days the love of many will Wax cold……..
Diana faked her death went into witness protection she will be back ❤x
Reptilians
At work we were negotiating a pay rise. We were offered the obligatory 3% as the budget would not allow for more.   At a meeting I told a manager we could afford more   based on the public financial report.    I said the problem was if we got more managers would need a lot more to maintain the difference.  And that is what we can't afford.   Let's just say the response wasn't nice.
I have never liked the monarchy  because it is all about one family who will take it all and nothing for the rest. Robin Hood has been my favourite book.
the Nazi king
Well done as a formed brit after Diana died l went on internet and dug up all kinds of stuff on that reptilian family  l remember as a schoolgirl saying when Charles was you that he would be the downfall of his family and it’s happening before our eyes Willian will never rule it will be over the adulterer and the Rottweiler will end it
As an American I have always been perplexed by how and why the British people put up with this charade, it so passé in the sense that they’re just costumed losers living with all the entitlements and stolen loot of their bloodthirsty forebears.
We can't understand why at alllllllllllllll, And G .D save the  queen 🇨🇦🇨🇰🇬🇧🔊🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶..
Royals history is extortion   That’s there power. They are nothing.
99% of your comments are true...however. You don't understand. Your revolution failed because the City of London still owns you.  The US revolution failed because the City of London owns DC since 1871.  The only difference is we still have the second amendment so bloody Charles and his inbred offspring and minons will have to come take our land.  That has not worked out for them so far.
Good on you! Praying for you and your message! So true. I pray you can get it done!
Royalty an obsolete institution, surviving in Britain and the commonwealth because no one has seriously tried to abolish it?
Whats new any case i thought he was chosen by god
I think we’re entering a global Great Awakening….
I always thought that QE2 stayed queen as long as she did to limit Charles time on the throne.
Some don't realize that this goes back a very long ways. Since the beginning of mankind. These are all bloodlines that they trace back and worship a vastly different type of religion most are accustomed to knowing about.
Pure jealousy on your part.
I’m an American so the Monarchy is strange to me.I’m a bit surprised to see the number of British admirers ,especially in the older generations,when most Americans detest our “rulers” even though we’re led to believe we elected them.
Kingwingnut is indeed the product of generational interbreeding..
Young people have been brain washed
That's the clear truth
And....they've done nothing to stop the 3rd world invasion on your beaches.  Disgusting. Queen did FO about it too.
The Monarchy is only a constitutional Monarchy in England. In Scotland the people are sovereign!
Biggest welfare group in the world
Great vid mate. Along with the Pistols there are two other great bands you mention... The Levelers and New Model Army check em out the Levelers are a great band!
Royal families are the most bloodthirsty people ever in history…nothing has changed since the old days. They are monsters 👿
Sorry mate, it is the Government who pay soldiers and nurses, not the Monarchy. The Royal family work hard, do pay taxes, bring in tourists money. Our King served in the Navy and flew helicopters, as did  Prince William. They are apolitical and it is the government who decide who they meet like Donald Trump. Do you honestly think that any wealth they have will come to you if there is dissolution? Nah! You sound very jealous and angry.
Man deep down we know this ...
Maybe ex soldier can explain how the queen became queen. Shouldn't King Charles have abdicated, like his mother's uncle .king Edward V111 .. Who changed the rules for the  monarch.?
I agree but this told me nothing
They are gangsters.
im  canadian it makes me ill about royals
And i remember the picture of them all in the Daily Mail doing a  Natzi Salute, queenie commited treason against this country more than once,
facts love this guy
what a twat drs,nurses teachers railworker are all well paid they just live above their means
😂🎉
😂🎉

Think hard about what you wish for.  In America, we have elected heads of state, and the current situation with two factions dead set against each other is not ideal.   A note about Cromwell and Puritans:  Although Cromwell turned into a creep and the Puritans who settled here in America weren't always the best or kindest people, the Puritan aesthetic contributed a great deal to the formation of the American nation, particularly their work ethic.  We could use a few Puritans around here today.
Our revolution is suppressed by the BBC owned by the Royal Charter and also our manipulated education system.
. . so get revolving. . .crown the glory of WE .
They are just figure player's,
Charles treated Diana like crap 💩.  💩. I believe Diana was groomed for that life. But they treated her disgustingly
MOST OEOPLE COULD NOT DO THE KINGS WORK ANY WAY!!!. GOD SAVE!!! THE KING !!!.❤❤❤😊😊😊!!!.AMEN!!!.
you are saying the truth my brother. It’s time for this mafia  and criminals to come down  and be judge by the people .
Can’t stand these people so arrogant and entitled complete hypocrites
can only feel sorry for this rude bitter narrator
May god (some kind of myth) bless and keep the king 17,014 kilometres away!  The Governor General does a very good and much cheaper job.
Thankyou for your service. Thankyou for sharing a truth us colonised peoples understand.
Typical anti Royalist who blames the RF for the faults of governments past AND present.
As a canadian soldier, I wished so hard we would do away from the royal joke of the monarchy when Elizabeth 2 died…  Instead of going the same way as many other ex commonwealth and ditching it, we embraced it even more and we’ll get to see him on our 20$ bill and 1$ coins. That’s one of the many "cosmetic changes" that accomplishes nothing other than wasting tax payers money and celebrating an out dated concept that needs to be permanently abolished for the good of all.
he is not a British Soldier if he bad mouths our king
No matter how wonderful the mass media say they are, the royals are just a "ruling family" and anything but ethical, moral or democratic.
it will be revealed that "someone" had the queen murdered in her bedchamber.   she was not impared  before she died.  this is why charle  s will not be king very long. when I see ch. and camill a all smiley and happy, I remember Diana's pain and heartbreak.  I think the  he only pretended to love D. his heart was with Cam.
According to author, Tim Cohen, he is The AntiChrist.
King Chuck the One got chucked under the axe.  King Chuck the Two got chucked under the axe.  Need I say anything more about King Chuck the Three
You got that right Sir.. I agree with you one hundred ( 100  ) percent...
How dated was that picture of Charles & Camila wearing their crowns, didn’t belong in this century.
His role is to be king, thank god he's not an African king, then he would really be a nasty....
Dethrone the bastards
They the establishment must keep this lot going simply because their livelihood depends on it  shear wast of funds on a dysfunctional family  Time to say good bye
Never been a monarchist but did respect the late queen. Sadly Charlie is a complete embarrassment
I see Charles wearing paratroopers wings.  Has he ever jumped out of a plane to earn them? He sickens me. As does his "queen".  She gives the word a bad name. She is a tramp. So is he.
Royal  Mafia. They give some  of what they take but keep the best for themselves. Socialists want to make a royal class for them selves.
Wow, this guy is bitter.
Did you think he was Jesus?????????
would any king prior to the regicide of charles 1st say to the people you will own nothing and be happy ,is doubtfull
Look through the form to the function underneath, the glittering presentation of naked power.
Royals perform the function of guaranteeing inherited wealth.  One can also see from demonising of di in run up to iraq war the part they played in recking progressive marriage of harry and meghan that the elite like to use the royals a sa political football.  Charles is very green and voluntarily pays tax on some revenue.  Why not use divide and conquer on the elite they as they use it on us.  Harry seems the only person capable of attacking elites secret police the newspapers they could be an ally.  Furthermore looking at trump in america there are dangers in elected head of state.  A cheaper streamlined royalty along european lines could be a good idea.  I believe a meritocracy is best produced with socialism rather than communism. Afterall it was a laugh seeing charles wear greek tie.
In the land if the blind the one eye is king 😅
What garbage this guy s-outs..maybe he needs to live in a country like Iran ..There are Royal families throughout the world…a fact of life.
They say the Royals bring in money. Get rid and then start allowing tourists to pay to go round Royal palaces etc. See how much that brings in without the same overheads. Even an ardent capitalist could not argue against that model
Arthur The Bear Is Back
fun fact : HM Elizabeth II removed charles from the succession when he refused to stop his affair with a married woman. he also is a divorcee which automatically removed him from the succession by english stautatey law. did I mention that he secretly converted to islam? that was some 25 years ago.. HM Elizabeth II prefered William for her successor. a shame she didn't name him so officially, it would have removed charle's claim, as well as andrew's as the title would allready have passed to the next generation.
Yes why should there be kings and queens? Owning everything? They are inbred weirdos for the modt part.
Why anyone would want to crown a crossdresser is beyond me, but whatever. 🤷‍♂️  At least he'll have his Mum's old outfits to wear once they've been let out.
UK needs become a republic royal family is a drain on finances and old fashioned abolish is my view.
They lulled you into “democracy”, “civilised West”, colonialism, voting, Brexit, conflicts & wars left & right & all other BS. Awaken Britain from all royal brainwashing, PR & gossip.
The French Revolution was also carried out by the Edomites
I will try again.Cromwell was financed and worked for the Edomites
Lol...youtube banned me for 24 hours because of my comment here
They lulled you into “democracy”, “civilised West”, colonialism, voting, Brexit, conflicts & wars left & right & all other BS. Awaken Britain from all royal brainwashing, PR & gossip.
Get rid of the monarchy.  Useless mouchers.  Perverts. 😊
Agreed you need to earn your gongs
Military Cosplay. Spot on.
The only medal Charlie should wear is the Jimmy Saville fixed it for me.
Just another unhappy schmuck.
Royalty is Satanic
So chain-smoking is cool? How old are you, 12?
YES! YES! YES!!  Finally a local speaks out!  Bravo!  They are crooks and grifters that's how they got where they are.  No offense meant, and this excludes the rational thinking Brits, but you folks are SUCKERS to support them.  Sorry.
What do you think of the monarchy of the Principality of Sealand?
Haha this was truly refreshing
That's all they've ever been. A bunch of freeloaders.
daphne galizia assasination- malta. MALTA....... CORRUPTION..... What did Queen Elizabeth do in Malta? Elizabeth II. lived happily in Malta 💃 memories and pictures ... From November 1949 to 1951, Queen Elizabeth II, back then Princess Elizabeth and Duchess of Edinburgh, resided at Villa Guardamangia in Pietà, Malta. These days were filled with endless picnics, balls, dances, sunbathing, and water-skiing for the princess. It was a fairytale life on the sunny Mediterranean island....[BEING INDOCTRINATED INTO FREEMASONRY] IN LOUIS BATTENBERGS HOUSE.
I am waiting for William to take over- not impressed in Charles and Camilla
You know what the funniest thing about Youtube is People read the subject and click that little thumbs up thing   Could they be a little biased  This man is preaching to the converted  ITs not a debate
And the native ethnic plans goals keeps being met for the replacement of local native social cultures people
Aren’t they illegitimate?? I agree . How is it “royalty” get to be military heads?  Wild. Don’t worry our old man is illegitimate as well.. for people to tell you otherwise they lost their minds. Charles seems to me to be a scared little boy.. his mother seemed to be the ones w balls.. I bet William will be more like granny.  They are all entities .. they don’t care of the people.
Yup our Royals have now had their day. We need constitution with elected head of state. The award scheme is out dated and only goes to those in the arts entertainment or wealth. Really what value do they bring. It’s Disney acting, while UK thinks of Empire, where in reality we are Banana Republic third world broke country with depleted military.
Well said Joe.  Agree 100%.  All the more powerful coming from a former British soldier.
I’m an American who lived in England for a couple of years when I was a child. I have such warm memories of the British people and had culture shock when we returned to the US where I couldn’t get decent fish and chips or a good cup of tea. I’ve never understood why such a great group of people would willingly agree to perpetuate a class system based on titles. The other day I watched a video about Charles’ deposed relative king Constantine living in London. The man couldn’t believe his people would vote him out. He gave a tour of his former home pointing out the helipad from which he flew to and from “work” every day. He also flew home for lunch daily and then back again. Could you imagine hiring someone who expected that kind of perk. This is nothing compared to the British family that calls themselves “the firm”.  I’m still appalled at the way Charles was able be to “rehabilitate” his and his mistress’ image and put her on the throne. When I hear people say that Diana’s death was a long time ago and we need to forgive them and be happy he now has his true love I feel sick. I’m no fan of Harry and his wife but I hope Diana is watching and laughing every time they cause more problems for his family. They were all jealous of her and even William, who loved her is going along so he can inherit the throne.
Fair comment but what’s the alternative..President Starmer
Lots of countries do not have monarchy They still have poverty Are there no poor people in rich countries If you can bother to look around the world instead of screaming  bellyaching rants, there is far more poverty than in the UK Who would be in charge of this wonderful republic  Someone like Trump or Biden  Why is this DDN promoting this  man who claims to have been a soldier He is not
The world has rich and poor You canthexarchy
This babble mouth should move to Russia otr any coimmunist state
Well done good to see the ordinary British man wake up u go man ditch those bunch of paseos called ur monarch loveing ur message from Ireland
As a Navy veteran and a man who was once married to a royalist, it's a breath of fresh air to hear a Brit speak the truth about those royal turds. My ex-wife is from Newcastle, her and her family loved the royals, made me sick . As an American, it was insufferable to hear them gush over them every time something was aired about them.
🎉 4:08 the 4:29 4:31
Not be long before the woke lunatics turn on the royals, bring it on.
I wholeheartedly agree with you.   I have always thought that if a country is going to have a royal family, at least let their roots BE from that country.   The "Windsors" (or whatever they're calling themselves this century) are GERMAN!!!
Disgusting Lizard People.
I have no time for Charles as he is in deep with the WEF
The guy is quite accurate. And he has served in the UK military. He is quite accurate.
I totally agree with every word you say
I agree. They are not special. In fact, they are German Jews
Watching frm Mumbai India... this is 2u former British Soldier speaking on this video betraying king Charles.. this is very disgraceful & disrespectful of you 2show disrespect to King Charles let God be yr Judge the Bible says, for all have sinned (including u British Solddier) & come short of d glory  of God ... in the last days they will.hate ,& betray one  another...this is so shame ful wat ur doing 😢b4u point a finger at King Charles this is what JESUS SAID: whosoever is  without sin(including u British Soldier in this video ) let him cast the first stone.

All monarchies are unnecessary and corrupt. I personally believe, satanists.
Tbe other day when watching a yt  video of Gianni Versace's  death and funeral, (he was ahot 15 july 1997) Princess Diana attended rhe funeral. (seemingly Gianni and the Princess had been close friends.)   Elton John sang at the funeral. . Later I was stunned to see another yt  video  of Princess Diana's tragic death, 31 August 1997,  with Elton John singing.at her funeral. The ahort interval between the two tragic dearhs and Elton John singing at both funerals, gave me goosebumps.
The word probably is Parasites ??? Enjoyed listening to you.
You are full of it.
I guess one day it will all go away with the next generation.
There are no council houses available mate .imagine living next door to charles
I agree 100% with you, although I now live in a rigged election dictatorship in my country, Brazil, I understand that we have every right to elect who we want to represent us, who is our lawyer and economist, who takes care of our prosperity, and I think that jamsi should never have currency on this planet again, as it is the only planet that works this way, implemented by the Dracos, and there should also be no monarchy, nor any type of criminal hereditary government on Earth. But this ends now in 2024, especially when Prince Harry tells the world that his mother is ALIVE! So, Happy 2024 to you, and everyone on this planet, because this year the masks will come off!!!!🙌⚖️💫🌟👏👏🌎
Well done sir for speaking out
Elite love shaking the ants in the jar.
Charles is on the Ebstein’s list
There's a reason us Americans won't shut up about our Revolution- and with good cause. Many of the reasons you are bitching about British society are the reasons us Americans won't shut up about our freedom. It cost us dearly to throw off the tyranny of Monarchy and we won't easily go back to it.
U.K. needs to go into receivership for malfeasance  but limeys are weak kneed peasants ,really quite sad.
Make royalty illegal
This guy is a wierdo
I listened to you.  You are telling what every body can see and feel.  But tell us about a solution that is practical.  There are issues like that even in America.  The issues show up every where because we as human beings are the issue.
The only one deserving military respect is Harry. At least he went into conflict and became part of his comrades
100 millions pounds for coronation wow. English people are blind. Wow and more wow.
Yes, boom, you are the king has not happened to any of us. Sick Yes, you are correct they are the dirt of dirt. Since Dianna, this all is a show.
Have two viperous traitors got to you 🤑👿 ?
Yes that's so True, but to be honest i love the Royal Family to but i understand what you mean, because the Reality  is hard to see. Look at the Veterans, they fight for our freedom but at the end the Monarchie don't give a Damn about the Veterans.
As an American, this resonates with my personal belief that our political system and the fools that participate in it should cease from existing.  I am a big boy and I need no one to reign over my soul.  That is God's job.  I believe people for the most part are good and just want to be left alone, not willing to create problems for their neighbor.  May God bless the people of Britain to return to him and free them from the tyranny that is worldwide Mafia.
Prince Charles is the Anti-Christ
I agree with you
I’m ready for Prince Charles to let Prince William take over!
We know that on Turtle Island.
another Child Molester
Apparently the WEF answer  to King Charles  ! He is very powerful ! We need to be concerned !
I directly descend from Hugh Crawford who was the Uncle of William Wallace who later became Braveheart. I'm a 7th generation Floridian....there's a reason why my family came here on the same voyage to America as George Washington...i know about the bloodlines.
Tragically, millions of British people believe the political lies of the right-wing, tory backing propaganda rags, such as the Sun, Daily HateMail, and Daily Express.
My son did 4 tours of Afghanistan, 4, that’s 2 years of his life and mine, Harry did 3 months and we’re never allowed to forget it 😡😡😡😡
As Argentine, it is very well known here that Prince Charles purchases all leather Polo gear, ie boots, saddle, etc, and did it so through a third party during the Falklands war. I don't know how many British died, but his boots and saddle were of importance.
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🫡 cheers mate well said.
Question, please, why don't you talk about the origin of the king? Is it true that the father was born in Greece and the other father was born in Denmark and he came and married the queen and now he is a king of origin that is not properly understood but is famous for crime. Andrew is the biggest criminal within the kingdom and the people in England are like a commodity. Until he is liberated from Zionist arrogance
Beats me how in the 21st century people are still cheering on self-proclaimed rulers and arms dealers. Even in so-called democracies, corporations and banks hold most of the power.
We should be proud of the fact we have the most famous parasites in the world
You make an assumption that the next person to follow would be any different.
Sir, I watched your video and agree with everything that you say.  But the question still remains, why won't you and people like you in the UK do what is necessary to remove these creatures from the throne?  Or, in other words, what are you prepared to do?  There is no doubt that the United Kingdom has fallen to invaders of different creeds, different religions, different races and different beliefs, which are not British.  And, yet, the British people...the real British people...have done nothing, are doing nothing and most likely will do nothing to apprehend, arrest, detain and prosecute these creatures and the invaders that they back.  Still more tragic, none of you will march into Parliament and apprehend, arrest, detain and prosecute all of the MPs who are complicit in the crimes of the "royal" family and your Marxist Socialist government.  Do you really think that just talking about their vile corruption is going to make a difference?  No, it won't.  Action speak louder than words, but you and your countrymen are not prepared to do anything of significance to stop this tyranny and put an end to the very thing that has destroyed Great Britain and the British empire.  I grieve for England, because as a member of the true Aristocracy, I see how Holy England is being raped and pillaged by these creatures and their savages.  It breaks my heart.
This edgelord's ad hominem diatribe says more about him then the royal family. He yearns for a rublic, but he'll end up with a caliphate.   Also, there's nothing wrong with his hair, so why the need for a republic?
America is the same way.  Many embrace Dynasties passing power down over decades.  Women especially fall for the Romantic Vision of Princesses and Princes.  Kings and Queens that they would like to be or be a part of.
As a ex squadie, I have no loyalties to Charles or his slapper,most of my comrades, have ended their trust in the royalty after the death of Lizzy.
Why do the French in particular adore the British monarchy? It is because since they destroyed the French Monarchy they have regretted it every day of their lives. They are not bigots, they understand the damage they did to France because they followed a small number of jealous haters. The world knows what a democratic-level field of society looks like. It is not pretty.  Look at the USA Bidon affairs of corruption, father and son. It is the democrats that elected a man and his entourage that has led America into such a mess today. Do you really want to do that to Great Britain? Like the French guillotine hot hot-headed reactionists ended up cutting the heads of their own leaders because they woke up to the fact they had been sold something rotten to the core. Afterwards, the country fell into anarchy. Do you really want to do that to Great Britain? I sincerely hope not. A better option is to elect intelligent leaders, real leaders who believe in Great Britain, not weak livered wokeism, frightened of their own shadows, and frightened of strong leadership.
Anyone know the name of the 1600's revolution film shown in this video ??    *EDIT*    No worries, found it i think..... The Devil's Whore...... its on 4oD
Sorry come back those people are all forgiven
Pity your not running for the  country I would vote for you
Thank you 🙏
I hate that man Im with you on this keep it up
1 word. Satanic
Who killed Dianna
Well, how did you become a King? The lady of the lake...😂😂😂😂
I Never Bought Into The Whole "Monarchy/Royalty/We're Better Than Everyone Else"🐂💩....NEVER WILL!!!
It is obscene, and Charlie boy is WEF. Where did the so called royal family originally get their money to build their palaces.
King Bloody Charles; the absolute worst person to be made King is Charles with his scandal ridden Royal Family with possibly the only somewhat legitimate exception of Queen Elizabeth II but she’s dead so perhaps that should be the end of this whack job of a monarchy!
Thank you for making this video.
Charles is a pig. He was nasty enough to state, on television, when he was still married to Diana, that he’d rather smell Camilla’s “napkin” than sleep with Diana. I had never heard such a crude thing in my life. Just about that time Life magazine had a huge article featuring Charles showing off the all inclusive village he designed where one would never have to leave. He is apparently the arrogant, narcissistic jerk that is the father of 15 minute cities. Vile, he is vile.
FALSE NEWS . THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HARRY PUT OUT THERE , LIES👹👹👹👹
Ok so that's your opinion but what's your answer to it all?
Queen is not dead she stood down she couldn’t be part of the new world order which is being brought in under the guise of climate hoax
Tim Cohen's book reveals King Charles is the anti-christ.
Be VERY careful using the term Democracy or democratic.  All democracies degrade into communism eventually.  There has to be other 'checks and balances' - not just 'democracy'.  You said it right when you said that 'republic' idea, and that is where America got the idea of a republic and many of its laws (Magna Carta, etc.), so they are based on some VERY good ideas, but be careful about being too quick to think that 'democracy' is the be-all, end-all answer.
Great presentation. As a USA American my opinion on the UK Monarchy is of no great consequence. From this distance, and having visited the UK several times, it appears to me that having a monarchy is not a healthy thing for democracy in the UK. Maybe I just see it that way because I am an anti-royalist at heart. I don't like it when people here in the USA get in worship mode for any of our politicians regardless of their silly Party affiliations. So here we are two and  half centuries after ditching the UK monarchy and we still have people who want to worship some well-fed politician. Maye its a basic defect in human nature taht has yet to be completely bred out of the gene pool.
They can call themselves whatever they want but they ain’t no king or queen of mine. I’ve never liked them they don’t do shite for me so they can do one
100% agree wit this
Invoke magna carte
I agree, all royal families have made their wealth from murder and domination, they are a relic from the past, and should no longer be excepted as any authority over anything, they don't do anything to protect the people and are just a criminal wealth grabbing scam on the people.
That made you a moron potential  H-Bomb
All monarchy must go...not just philandering child Charles.  Power to the people is true democracy where every citizens could dream to be a leader Of his country. Elizabeth, and now her son King Charles is not a mere titular leader but a directly leading with Armed forces, Foreign Affairs, Mi6, Finance, Parliament under their control. That is why, tyrrant  Nazi UK has no constitution to ensure the mafia gangsters continue lord over the people.
Thank you... keep speaking up.. many of us need to see and hear this stuff...   all so corrupt and evil
Without the Monarchy, England is just a dreary, rainy island with little to no appeal.  There are some areas of natural beauty but not enough to attract tourists.
Their scam lines the pockets of many, many cling ons in high places, who will do whatever it takes to keep the gravy train rolling.
It was never God's intention for man to have kings on this Earth.
Can't and never could image why the ordinary  people  on the street look up to these people  why really blinds them?
The good guys will always get killed off and you'll always end up with someone like Stalin or Putin or even Trump if he gets to be President again. It just doesn't work unfortunately. The common people were only too grateful to get their monarchy back again after Cromwell.
I totally agree with this guy  As being ex service personal I’m totally sick of all the royals
Whatever they call themselves and see themselves as is nothing but a mafia system in disguise. And they are linked to vatican which uses religion to mask their mafia and gangster origins. The state of abuse and exploitation of the masses even using what they call democracy and government are all pointers to the fact that it’s this same mafia, gang system that controls lives everywhere.  These are beings with base and awful character that have found treacherous ways to convince people to like them even as their horrendous abuses of human rights are all in the open. It’s their wicked, evil and aggressive makeup and construct that gave rise to the military and have led to countless loss of innocent lives everywhere on our planets. Their selfish, greedy, plundering and exploitative behaviour on our planet show they may have alien origins. If they truly are citizens of our planet, they’d be more kind and exhibit universal love not the looting, plundering and advantage taking of people at the least chance they get.
What a fool your country won’t have half the tourist income  if it wasn’t for your monarchy for  you think a republic and a president would be better  there as corrupt as any government   How foolish are you  its your government is as corrupt hiding behind the monarchy  you need to be thankful you have the freedom to speak your mind in your so called democracy you live sn appear to not be happy with go live in another country fir a while an appreciate what you have    These countries talk of there revolution’s but revere your monarchy
Exactly right ,Theese Criminal Royals need to bought to justice , nothing but murderers an a Vermin on the taxpayer ,WHY ARE THEESE PEOPLE EVEN HERE , THEY FO NOTHING,BUT FINANCIAL CRIMES ,
The Civil War eas not a revolution. It wad a petty bourgeois coup d'etat.
Punk rock was s psyop between MI5 and the music industry.
Johnny Rotten ended up a shill for the butter industry.
Yeah, but in France you can't drink the tap water,  and the cops are all trigger happy goons.
As a young lad our whole school was turned out to line the pathways so that The Queen could cut a ribbon to open a new factory. It was pissing down with rain, freezing and a wind was howling that nearly took us off our feet. I was only 12 or 13. We waited for their arrival, and waited, and waited - after about 45 mins her car sped past so fast that I didn't even get its colour! Could we go back to school? No we had to wait there for her exit back to Holyrood Palace. After about another 45 mins we went back to school as she never appeared - there was a quicker way back to the Palace than the way she had come. My only though was- "what is all this bollocks?". It still is.
WOW! I only now realized that England indeed had a revolution akin to our American revolution only much earlier!
what a paper hat
The occupation of Palestine started because of UK why don’t the king just stop the occupation and do an actual 2 state
All hail Lord Sausage Fingers! 😁⭐️
These are gangs that control England, especially the Bani Zionists. In short, they treat people like commodities.
It is widely believed that the Royal Family organised the assassination of Princess Diana via MI6 because she was pregnant from a person other than Prince Charles.
How refreshingly truthful
The people who are having to fight for a pittance - the nurses, the doctors, the train crews and all the rest - aren't being done down by the monarchy, they're being ripped off by the elected, and the unelected, members of this corrupt, dishonest government!
List the land belongs too God our creator, anyone thinking they Owen land is dreaming, remember we all die and cannot take the land with our lives are but fleeting in time.
Charles has been a nasty vile man treating Diana the cruel way he did. He is the head of the Church of England after having an adulterous affair with Camilla and getting rid of his wife.  That sets a good example to us all.
Who are they to say they stand above the people????? They are like scavengers.....parasites. useless to society.
People wearing un-earned medals?  In the US, we call that "stolen valor".
The flag waving public are bused in to shout and wave. They are unemployed >> won't work layabouts.
Long Live the Republic
The royal parasites!
He is not the true or corrdct bloodline to the throne, nor is his entire family the proper errors to the throne..     The correct bloodline and true king  was acteueally  fully reasearched and also televised and put on YouTube       they found the true correct bloodline to the throne..     they found that Man and his family liveing in Texas on a farm  and gave a full interview of him wile he was still alive..he has a famu as well.       So King Charls is infact not the true king nor should his decedent's take the throne.     the throne should be overrun tsken over buy its people, and its wealth distrusted equitably between all its citicens.
WATCH HOUSE  OF WINDSOR And the NEW WORLD ORDER VERY INTERESTING
Charles and Andrew on the list for Epstein island
Britain's warmongering role in the world.  The monarchy has long been promoted as just a symbol of national identity, family values and unity, and especially representing those values in times of  proxy-war. 😟
👏👏💯🔥
They re German Nazis.
And King Charles now appeared on Epstein’s flight log to pedo island
Really informative on a very serious subject and well done on making it so highly entertaining. 😊
I think as a kiwi that the monarchy is a pariah.a facade.to earn the respect of any public they need to dirty their boots in civvy life and live morally upright lives that merit admiration that they've clearly lost.diana had our attention
Wahnsinniges Kasperltheather krankhafte Inzucht
As an American I was surprised that the Queen did not step down and let Charles take over.  Then I realized he is viewed by at least the Britons I have met as a fop.  He should have been bypassed for Prince William.  That said I ask "What is the function of the Monarchy?  Do they actually rule?  If King Charles decides to ban all gas powered vehicles and Parliament says NO, who would win?.  My personal belief is that the Bureaucracy of the British has a vested interest in keeping the Monarchy alive.  No difference with our bureaucracy and view that the president actually rules.  What really irks me is when I see the King of fops wearing unearned medals and military regalia like a poser.
Agree
I agree with everything you say, and could never address one of these knobheads as' your highness'. As for wearing kilts and uniforms which they have no right to, well it works to fool the gormless. You only have to look at John Wayne who won every battle America fought. except he didn't, but the yanks think he's a hero. I'm glad you can say this and not end up in a gulag! That's what we really fought for. The sight of Charlie with his silly crown surrounded by gold must have half the world laughing, but he can't see that. ( the half that isn't starving! )
Can I have some more beans sir?
If you leave Britain you can look in and like watching an aquarium where the minnows are swallowed by the sharks. The biggest predator in there is the monarchy. Like sharks, they are top predators just like Charles is.
Agree with everything he says
I have never been a royalist i did have to swear alligence to the queen once when i jouned our countrys army but she.s gone now and any loyalty has dissapeared nowadays i have realise the leeches the royals have become, its time they were gone and as for the names on the epstein list well says it all really. thanks doubledown great stuff.
The TRUE heir to our thrown lives in Australia, our current royal family are NOT the genuine royal bloodline, there is a documentary proving who the real royal bloodline is..!
Mate you are a Soldier. Before I watched ur Vid. i played amon amarth/saxon ,anarchy UK and Megadeth -this was my life. Burmese dude  in earth _Perth Aussie.     TY for the Truth    god bless ps.   JESUS was a Renagade. Long Live King Harry 🌹
Sounds like justin trudeau Canadian pm
Charles lost it for me when he had Camilla crowned, an insult to the memory of the mother of his children and going against the wishes of his mother.
WHY HARRY GOT THE HELL OUT OUT OF THERE!!
👏👏👏👏👏👏
Luciferian worshippers
Well done raising this  I agree with most of what you say These thieves really need to embrace frugality They are out of control  Unfortunately the widespread media are responsible for their god like existence  Reminds me of  Marie Antoinette "" Let them eat cake ""
You don't want to be like USA 😢
Republicanism is far left in it's very core. EVERYTHING wrong in the UK comes from the left, and this is the apex of leftist views. So no, thank you.
Time for the UK. to get out of the 18th century... and grow up ...!
The monarchy should be dismantled then? Then what? I don't disagree with you on so many levels but I'm all for offering an alternative  before changing the Royal structure. There have been good monarchs, it's the sycophants that fawn about them who seem to be the cause of  problems.
At last. Someone voices my belief's, l hate all monarchy's and dictator's.
What with 2 members of the Royal fam being on Jeffrey Epstein's aeroplane to his island, maybe you guys should consider doing to the Royal fam the same that was done to that other unfortunate King Chuck.  😅😅
This is what fact is.
I like this guy! Now do one about politicians who are the modern day version of kings and queens mixed with a dollop of Hollywood illusion.
They are the largest welfare family.
Before you get rid of them better look at the economic repercussions.....how many tourists and their MONEY visit because of the royal panoply and ceremonies.  I understand it is far more then they cost...........
King Charles in name only He is not our King he is a Disgrace to England just like the rest of his family, lady Diana was the Thule princess but as we know she was murdered,
The Royal family are not true royals if you look back in history they are German
He's the antichrist
Don't understand why we have Monarchy. Most of them haven't worked a day in their life And live a life of privilege while many. English people live in poverty and go hungry. I lost interest in the Royal Family family because of the way the queen and charles treated diana who died a horrible death. She was the one who did so much charity to poor,sick people and actually made a difference. The monarchy died when princess Diana died.😢
May God bless the King, confound his enemis within and with out & especially protect from his 'friends'  is the prayer a Colonial would offer to the CROWN that sits on that mans head, not forgetting, as a man myself, that the best of men are but men at best accept him for his reign, a reputation I have no doubt he would like to be proud of. Without the crown he would enjoy his wealth & easily protect himself from media ad other traitors within the gates.
What amazes me is how few people know that the House of Windsor came into being in 1917, when the name was REPLACED as the British royal family's official name by a proclamation of King George V. Their true historic name is Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.
Thank you for sharing the truth. ❤
look at the terrible state of USA and also Russia..  Royalty is important
Then you go be the king! Quit whining like a little girl who got enlisted in the military… Go do something instead of run your mouth, and make YouTube videos
I desist Chucky de Turd, your current monarch, but you seem like a sniveling Communist who would like to rewrite British history and offer NOTHING in exchange!
A monarchy is just a Mafia that consolidated wealth and power until it became the strongest force in the land. It then enforced a protection racket on the population to accumulate more wealth to maintain the loyalty of the hierarchy and it's muscle.
That's a big reason I love the movie"King Ralph" I suggest everybody watch that movie for a good laugh
I heard a story about a group of people who realized the truth about the King and did something, probably just a rumor....don't you think.
Don't know crap about the East India Company or its rivals either.
No, it is not yours by right. You have William I to thank for that, as well as the Rump Parliament and Oliver Cromwell, and then you also have Parliament to thank as well once again as well as George III. You want to blame the Royal Family but you should be blaming Parliament and your local councils as well.
Why don’t they do away with the monarchy
What about Canada then?🇨🇦
Yes the guy makes a lot of sense and then you have people talking about British colonialism hey look what's going on in the west today we realize what colonialism was about to some degree it means that since he's a third world countries are colonies these people can come to Britain like if you're from India the British colony they say but the people that set this up it's just like in America they sign all these treaties to defend the world but they're not going to send their brothers out the door they're going to send the average American over the decades and a lot of people don't understand that that the white people have been used by the ruling class for the longest time call back in the 1900s look how many people were killed off in those two world wars millions and millions of white people in them two world wars don't have a problem with bringing all these migrants to Europe and even America people cried about oh look what happened to the American Indians the same pieces of s*** on saying anything about why are we bringing these other migrants to America if we need to get this back to the Indians it's called order out of Chaos it appears to me the chaos is getting worse
Yes that’s how I see them too
King Charles is the only person on the planet that fits the description and characteristics of the Anti-Christ. Let that sink in...
Change is comming...
You are certainly validated today my friend with US president Bill Clinton formally connected to the Epstein case that includes royal Andrew. May the guilty be punished hard when convicted in America 🇺🇸 where we live free or Die.
Carry on!
There is no perfect form of Government.   You cannot please everybody.   Loyality is equally hard to find.  To criticise is easy.   Anyway  we had the coronation and the UK is facing far greater problems with is present government migration policies.   Better to get a handle on that!
I’ve aways thought the idea of “royals” is absolutely preposterous, and all these people who kiss their a$$ and want to know everything they do and LOVE being slaves or ‘commoners’ are mentally ill, like abused women sticking up for their abusers, it’s mental illness and years of abuse accepted. The biggest laugh is their phony military outfits and fake medals they wear, meanwhile this new ‘king’ can’t even tie his own shoes or do anything for himself, and if everything isn’t perfect throws a hissy fit like a spoiled child, what a joke. This whole ‘royal’ idea is a ridiculous idea from the past that needs to just disappear. It’s a joke that isn’t funny.
When you started with then words "chubby little fingers"..I knew nothing impartial would originate from your lips...you have a dark hatred in your heart and you are on  a crusade....I call out prejudice whenever i find it
nothing will change 2024 will it
Good job!
Love it great stuff.
Charles and Saville. Mates.
Sorry to disappoint you all but becoming a Republic won't change shit. Parliament is rammed full of scum.
King Charles, the turd killed a beautiful lady. I hate him and his like.
God save the ..... the fascist regime.
Inbread imbecils royall familly
It is not the royal family but the Rotten family, it has always been.
I friend of mine said to me charles will try walk through you instead of going by, inside the palace no matter who you are. And hes also the biggest wanker in person apparently. I dont personally know because i dont care for the royals 😂
I knew Leo was a pedo😂😂😂😂😂😂I wonderful if He jumped on Greta when she was a kid😂😂😂😂😂At that camping you know😂😂😂😂😂😂
6:35 !!!  DAMN RIGHT, the "Americans" never shut-up about the revolution and war of independence FROM THE CROWN!   We love the people of the UK, but YOUR Monarchy caused most of the world's problems...from abandoning the colonies in the middle east with little reasonable borders, leading to endless wars - to - leading the world toward Leftist/Marxist ideological policies.  I hope Charles is disliked enough to end that terrible institution.
They are also Nazi's. Prince Harry exposed them when he wore a full Nazi uniform.
Best well thought out video on the tube.
He's the Devil
Well said, and the truth unfortunately
I am a monarchist, it's a system of government that works. It's not the=at the services swear allegiance to the monarch, they swear allegiance to the subjects, ie us, and not any government, dictator or president. But, for things to be stable, you need a viable opposition. That creates an atmosphere of justification and proof. It's the same with politics, you need a viable opposition, for debate. A landslide is not good for the country. A head of state? Needs to be the right person. Charles isn't in so many ways.JS, PB, GC, LM. Called as a witness: The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse
👍👍
Not my King!! Just a cheat and his ruthless concubine.
You left out the sex pistol line, "She's made you a moron!"
Bunch of morons and nay sayers, who frankly cant think straight due to there own raving. £100 million to crown Charles seems a good deal really when you consider its estimated the tourists brought a Billion. We have a pretty unique institution in the UK with the Monarchy, yes they cost, yes they live way above the place most of us do and probably have little to no idea about day to day issues, however they bring in huge amounts of money via the fact they exist, folks round the world tend to flock to see them and visit our little island to do so. DDN is it Dick..ds dealing nonsense?
What a load of rubbish
It’s about time someone spoke the truth……………finally! From a ex-squaddie 👍
I always said that The Royals, are the biggest con ever. People are quick to criticize as an example The Swaziland "Prince". Yet there is zero difference between a Swazi Prince or a British Royal Prince, a Prince from Monaco or wherever. What a laughable joke, gullible folk are impressed. This world is a joke.
You said Cromwell became a tyrant.  I am not a royalist but we would replace one bunch of crooks for another "absolute power" !!!!!
I hate the lot of them.
I certainly wouldn't want to be like the Europeans! I If that's the only alternative give me the Royal Family, anytime, lol.
Whats with the medals this  dude was never in COMBAT.you people in england need to wake up how much money does it take to keep these usless people in money
What a fool. They do pay tax. They do support the nation. They bring in more than they take.
This so unfair. Did Andrew not go to Falklands? Or Willi or what's his name to Afghanistan?
So great to hear an individual speak truth & have common sense. The saying goes common sense is not so common. It’s always been unbelievable to me that people still today defend the monarchy that only takes from them & the generations before themselves & so on. Just knowing the history of these families should give one enough sense to know they are criminals, they engage in all sorts of criminal activities that affect citizens of many countries including their own; it’s all about power; money & power. It floors me that people still believe the lies. And yes it was obvious to me, as it should be for anyone else, those B.S. uniforms they wear. Not for one moment did I ever believe those men served their countries. They help create the wars with their arms dealing.
I agree with most of what you say, but what you are forgetting is that our foreign government spends far more on the welfare of foreigners than it does on the royal family. The money it spends on Ukraine, ostensibly for its welfare, has in fact assisted in its destruction, and the money spent on foreigners arriving illegally in this country is helping to destroy UK. This enormouse unnecessary expense is one of the reasons we cant aford to pay out medical staff properly, but the NHS is grossly mismanaged and wasteful, so that is another reason.
Royal family = parasites
I always thought Charles was auditioning to be in the village people
WE  OWE  NO  ALLEGENCE  TO  AN  INBRED  GERMAN  FAMILY
I have never understood how the monarchy survived beyond the time they, hand in hand with the church convinced the general public that they were ordained by God and not just mortals that had lied, cheated and murdered their way to a position of power. All part of a long outdated institution overdue for decommissioning. (in my opinion🪓🌚)
Ah, the it's the lefty's toy Walt, talking any old bollocks just to sell his book to gullible knobheads.
king Charles wants MASK"S and DIAPERS ON COW"S ,the man is deranged
HARRY ENFIELD is far better value asa king..
LOUIS BATTENBERG (MOUNTBATTEN) taught charles everything he knows
Do you think if the royals were gotten rid of tomorrow, your life would be any better?
What are allllll those medals he wears for???? 🤔
Hmm interesting thank you I would miss the unity and memory of the times like the jubilee in the streets joining together on the other hand have the times past and not there anymore so why is the monarchy essential
For centuries the British have looked at the rest of the world, particularly the global south, as bring backward and barbaric. All the while following a feudal system and monarchy that is savagely backward and medieval. All the wars. All the genocide and bloodshed by the British in order of the monarchy.  When do you think it will be time to stop looking at the proverbial speck in the eye of the global south and start looking at the beam in your own?
I agree with your words whole heartedly .   I rote the late Queen , remndng her of how she & her famly , got to "own"  most of the land on the planet , courtesy of invaders , sticking in the eglish flag , into foreign soil and saying " in the name of his- her majesty , i claim this land "  .  Thats  whats left of the commonwealth of countrys , some of whom still have the monarch , for the twice annualy given baubles , which are often underserved by those who receive them .
2:06 ... No way - that can be real!
QUINE ELISABETH WAS THE LAST OF THE ROLYES
A disgrace of a family
These 3,327 who gave this video dislikes are bunch of bumbling peasants ( as former British soldier said ) .
I hope when the brits get rid of the monarchy that they take Piers Morgan with them.
Charles should not wear the paratroopers berets and pins that they don't get until they have earned  the right to wear them.  They jump from airplanes into war.  It's pathetic.  He should be embarrassed.  It's like Halloween.  I can picture him walking among the parades of real soldiers and then making comments like he does about everyone. He "can't stand those people."  Poor  old thing.  He has a lot to complain about.  He and Piers Morgan make a good pair. Yuck.
Now the Queens dead it's time to get rid.
Time for change .
Charles is a total Idiot
A 1,000 years of history was a fairy tail.  It never happened.  The 1 on coins are actually  i, x, j. Look carefully and you will see it from behind your brain washing.  We are in the time AFTER the tribulation.  In the time of great deception.
It's a hybrid. They eat human babies. Jimmy Savel supplied human children to these scm.
A  VULGAR  CELEBRATION OF  INEQUALITY.
The ONLY FAMILY that aspires to live and breed on state welfare benefits is THE ROYAL FAMILY.
As an American , I despise any type of royalty or nobility. This guy is the worst by far. A condescending , elitist snot. I also read he is a closet muslim.
Very shallow, one-sided argument. Stop illegal immigration, then you'll have a few more peas in your mash.
Stewart trust distributors need start Sharing their wealth via increasing social security’s funds and value’s so people are able to invest in their own homes instead of relying on the government money or banking system to sustain. To help people in need aid their daily lives like mentioned at the beginning of the video… Stewart trust 🟰 social security.. start with increasing people’s income to help them with their needs to be paid for their health care needs and help with their families basic need’s to get around the situation of hyperinflation everywhere in the world.
Wow not jealous much not sure why you served in the forces true sleaze bag
He’s one that is ahead of the One World Government He also helped his mother along.she was hanging on too long We know so much about him over here and I wish we could drop the monarchy Their run by the Elites anyway
Queen Elizabeth Ii was wondetful and held the British Commonwealth together over many difficult years. But with her passing, it is obvious that her heirs are nowhere near being suitable for the job and they must be retired to the obscurity where they belong. Charlie Boy in particular is a traitor to his country, having been a founder of the World Economic Forum, whose aim is to destroy sovereign countries and their elected national governments. In other words, democracy must be destroyed. Charlie needs to be incarcerated in the Tower before being tried for treason.
Scrap the monarchy
0:49 true wolf raven spiritually❤️🇬🇧💯 1:20
Get ridof the cheater and his mistress.
I would love to see this trator's "military record". Most likely kicked out the military.
Well he's a scumbag sell his country for a dollar
all people in power are in some ways dictators.. but all so call democracies in the 21th century is a scam that affect billions of people.. might as well have a dictator if it get the job done.. everything is subject..
There’s much to be said about  the anti-Christ.
Spot on mate - can't understand why people flock to see them in mass mindless droves to profess their love for them not understanding that the monarchy care less about the people than they do about dog crap on a sidewalk.
It's his/ their connections to paedophiles that concerns me, Jimmy Saville and Epstein......it terrifies me know that monarchy are paedos 😢 by the way, I am NOT suicidal.
KING PARKER-BOWLES AND CRUELLA DEVILLE HAVE A SON SIMON DORANTE-DAY. 58
Can't stand that adulterous LIAR
QUEEN VICTORIA WAS SO INBRED SHE SPREAD HAEMOPHILIA ACROSS EUROPE.... SHE NEVER VISITED INDIA but smiled as it was RAPED AND PILLAGED.
Yeah, tell Andrew to pose his own teddy bears on his bed, and tell Charles to iron his own shoe laces. What a bunch of spoiled little txrds.
The royal family pay the Vatican to keep the Crown 😮
PANTOMIME FAMILY put in place by british freemasonry for PR to cover up BLACKMAIL CULTURE SOCIETY.
GERMANS...... WINDSOR IS A MADE UP NAME IN WW1 FOR SACHS COBURG-GOETHERS..... MOUNTBATTEN IS A MADE UP NAME IN WW1 FOR BATTENBERGS
he LIED TO THE WHOLE WORLD with his SHAM MARRIAGE TO DIANA
The Monarch ended with Queen Elizabeth, King Chuckles With his ugly wife showed their true colors with Birmingham 2022 open ceremonies Pan Am games. Likely King Chucky is the Anti Christ.
This is something we don't understand in America anymore,  our forefathers had enough of their bs.
What an absolute load of nonsense I’ve never herd such sh..t  Living in the past never dose anyone any good  Long live our royal family you will never get rid of them
Being a soldier doesn't give you any insight, it doesn't make your opinion more valued or wanted. I agree wholeheartedly that the royals are disgusting, but nothing needs "exposed", they are demonstrably horrible
You are  a traitor to your uniform
Unfortunately, Double Down confuses two things; Charles Windsor and his family, and King Charles III. Charles Windsor is a person, and King Charles III is a part of the Constitution. Presumably he wants to abolish the monarchy, and not abolish Charles Windsor, which would be murder.  Removing the monarchy, i.e changing the Constitution, is a big thing, probably bigger or as big as Brexit,  and cannot be done lightly, especially as it involves the whole mechanism of Government. Any replacement is going to be costly, as any President is going to require all the trappings of an Head of State; good salary, nice house and all the perks plus the ceremonies, whatever they should be. However, very few people will want to travel to the UK to see the President, so it will be all cost. A change of Constitution has got to be shown to be an improvement and worth the cost.   Charles Windsor and his extended family, will have to be retired, and I hope that no one is stupid enough to suggest any punishment. This will be a cost, but reducing over time presumably. There is plenty of good examples in the world.  So in summary, we will require a Referendum to decide to change the Constitution. If successful, then somebody has got to draw up a new Constitution and have it approved by Parliament and the People, ie. a second Referendum. then we'll have to implement the new Constitution; i.e. probably vote for a President and an elected House of 'Lords'. There will be hardly any, if any,  savings available to finance the NHS, or other good causes. ( £100 million is only £1.50/person in the UK, ignoring any foreign countries that our monarch rules over )  And after all of that we'll probably finish up with some arrogant , pompous, grubby  politician, like all the other Presidents in the world. Just look at Sadiq Khan, Nicola Sturgeon, Emmanuel Macron, etc.
Well said, sir. We desperately need men like you. At the end of the day the royals are parasites.
Not my King
How do you think William will run the monarchy?
I dont want to insult British people, but it is funny how the Queen Elisabeth dont seem to miss to anybody (except for the monarchy afficionado), as if she never existed. Remeber how the Sex Pistols sang about her... But British would fall like London if the demography dont change.
I watched this expecting to see a reasoned argument against King Charles as our head of state. Instead, I saw a rant full of childish insults. Disappointing.
Sounds about right to me
Yes but hang on just a minute, Charles is going to replant his Christmas tree. This selfless single and responsible action easily undoes all the waste and profligacy.😊
Can you imagine Charles leading his Army to war
My biggest concern with a republic would be someone like Tony Blair or Trump getting into power. There have been lots of evil tyrant presidents too. I think I will stick with what we’ve got for now.
I am an American of long ago English descent with past ancestor names such as Wood, Adams, Rowell, and Flint.  I love the English monarchy.
i dont like him at all
I am an Irish Australian who served in the Australian Navy (zero allegiance to the crown).  Whenever we had RN's on exchange I was always struck by the uber obsequious tone they used when addressing the officer class.  Middle aged Chiefs with 30 years at sea would bow and scrape to 20 year old Tommy two dads with Toorak accents.  Always thought it was weird.
He really thinks he is in the line of king David he thinks he is in the line of Jesus Christ the true king is he the Antichrist told of they are not even the true blood line of royal blood they murdered the morjority  of the true blood line and took over  power they plonderd murdered millions of people took the land for themselves and called it there's all for power and authority
It’s all just subconscious reflex and old ladies now. But being honest, if they go… England goes. It won’t be England anymore. I hope there would be a really good plan for the after…. Then I think Brexit….
They get taxes from the working class that struggle while they live the glamor life and want one world order to steal everything you have
Delete.  UK is nufin without RF.  It is irrelevant just like you.
You are so right and don’t like them only person i like was harry and they treated him so nasty 🤴 king should not be the king because what he done to his first wife and what he doing to his son because he married a black lady
Not a fan either, but you do know who’ll be moving into BuckinghamPalace if or when the Monarchy falls?
I stopped supporting the monarchy when Princess Diana died.  They treated her disgracefully and now this has been transferred to her son Prince Harry.  He actually deserves to wear the uniform he saw actual service.  What has Charles ever done for this country?  Nothing.  Sadly Prince William has taken after his father.  He's married but has a mistress he insists is treated as part of the family.  That's why the media constantly attack Harry He's happily married and doesn't want a mistress.  There far too many royal arselickers who form nasty groups attacking Harry and Meghan at every possible opportunity.
Having things more " equal".  Equal and more equal are apples and oranges.  If someone is more equal that leaves someone as less.  To have more, there must be less. I understand what you're saying but human nature always gets in the way. Some group will always feel they deserve a bit more. What group gets to be less equal?
They stole the monarchy!
When did they ever do anything good for the world ?Only colonization of nations!
Not Windsers.  They pretend to be English.  Saxon Colberg.  German elite
# Ditch the king
You are right, they are dole bludgers
Royal family are good for tourism but not much else!
Jimmy Saville.
Charles 😆😆😆 Okay, another EVIL PERSON... HE SEND TO MURDER HIS WIFE DIANA. DIANA WAS GOING TO EXPOSE THEM ALL...!!
Spoken like a true Marxist.  I don’t like Charles or his politics ref. The WEF etc. & think he should step down & hopefully William would be less political.  You still haven’t proved how elected presidents are better. I think of any country that is any better at the top especially, the USA is just as bad if not worse with all the cronyism back room deals etc. look at Bidens family, biggest bunch of crooks ever & the evidence to prove it. Do you want putin or Zelensky. At least our monarchy does have the direct power presidents have.
I'm an American National, but the idea of some chap sacrificing his own children's future for the inbred imbeciles of someone he doesn't even know is fascinating to say the least!
you sound like one of us
They do pay taxes but nobody needs them .
I agree with you 💯 %
I'm pro-Republican but you lost me when you starting knocking the British people in favour of French, simply based upon their chic culture. This anti-English rubbish is why the Republican movement is held back.
WHAT I CANNOT UNDERSTAND, IS HOW CAN A ADULTEROUST BE HEAD OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND, AND HOW CAN HIS ADULTEROUST PARTNER, BE CALLED QUEEN ??...   WHY WAS HE NOT NAMED IN CAMILLA PARKER BOWLES DIVORCE ??
Ac riding to the bible he is one of the four horsemen .obhama putin and Kim jung the other three
AT THE END OF THE DAY BEING A SOLDIER AS COMMENDABLE AS IT IS DOES NOT GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO SLATE OUR SOVEREIGN IF YOU GOT NOTHING GOOD TO SAY ABOUT OUR KING THEN DONT SAY ANYTHING THE CROWN GIVES US AN IDENTITY AND I AMONGST MILLIONS OF OTHERS ARE GRATEFUL BEING BORN IN A NATION WITH MONARCHY
THIS GUY SHOULD BE ELECTED
Love your video. You're right what you're saying and the doctors are still fighting for their pay rise.the royals agree with the WEF which means they are not for the people. Your a brave guy for telling the people how it is. Its a joke
The Peasant's Revolt (1381) tragically stopped short.  They were hoodwinked into a truce which was then used to regroup and destroy them.  Fool me once, shame on you...
Your exposa, well it just wasn't and you even contradicted yourself. You are right about our woeful lack of our oen history and of course we should be proud of our revolution. It's untrue what you say about the historical buildings they own or the state own that they use, most of them are open to the public. It's also untrue that a king/queen cost us money. If there was no monarch there would be no changing of the guard and consequently no American tourists to watch it. Analysis have been made that show they more or less pay for themselves. We would have to maintain all those historic buildings regardless. They are our heritage. It would cost money to get rid of the monarchy..
When did they take your land?  Shame on you, sorry for the chips on your shoulders!
Royalty=injustice
I have always said that this phony Royal Family Grifting the British Taxpayers.  The Royals live lavish lifestyles .  While the rest of Britain are living the hard real life.  These royals have no real job, other than cutting ribbons leftist support of climate conditions.  Supporting WEF,  supporting EU ETC...  They are Grifters the whole lot of them.  Can't understand the British people supporting these phony Royals.
Totally agree with Joe.
Careful bro they could have you on the mi5 watchlist😂😂😂😂😂😂
Finally a sane voice......this country should be proud that we inspired the revolutions that created the freedoms of the modern world instead because we retained the monarchy we are lampooned as geriatric colonisers with a dead empire....meanwhile the royals have kept all their vast wealth while we have homelessness, underpaid workers and rising poverty.
Cromwell was as bad as any gangster royals and had no problem murdering and enslaving masses of Catholics, especially Irish Catholics. The casualty list of countries after the (English!) civil war was England 4%, Scotland 3% and Ireland 41%! So much for equality. There's something you won't be taught in UK schools.
This bloke is very bitter and resentful. He is also elitist in the sense that he is utterly convinced that he knows best how British society should be organised. You cannot get more elitist than that.
Of course they're gangstas! Good soft people cannot run this crazy dangerous world.
CHECK OU ARIZONA WILDERS TESTIMONY—SHE CALLS HIM PINDAR -⚠️🦎🐲🦎🐉🐍
Awakening!!
Charles the highest ranking freemason wouldn't even know how to wipe his own arse🤦‍♂️
Word brother.
Traitor
I did some research on King Charles.  I was not impressed.   Some of the things he funds is just not right.   His numerology number is 666.  Sorry Charles.  Its the truth.  Our world is not run anymore by good strong men.  It is run by the money we put into their hands.
This English Clown, must be in every battlefield for soo many medals he’s got.
BRILLIANT,  hi from Australia. The Royal family stole so much from Australia  too, as it did to all its colonies. Just ridiculous in 2024. " Off with their heads " lol
Saxo cober gotha.....shape-shifting,  child eating nephalim.  Not the head of the church. Repent and call on Jesus
They are an anachronistic emblem of all that is wrong and evil in the UK.
I am so about this video!!!!!!!!!!!
There is only one enemy of mankind, and that is the brutish British empire. Remember the modern surveillance state, in which the U.S. is a satrapy of the modern British oligarchical Globalist Liberal Imperial monetarist financial system Empire, and the citizenry is targeted and manipulated with the very same mentacidal mind control techniques employed in warfare. The difficulty arises when we assert that “It is the British who kill American Presidents.”  The difficulty is in getting people to see who the true enemy of our nation is. Our people, including perhaps you, have undergone decades of conditioning where it has been drummed into our consciousness that the British are our “closest ally,” our “cousins,” bound-at-the-hip by common bonds and a common cultural heritage. The dear British are simply our “funny accented” relatives. At the same time, a false hegemonic view has been imposed that the British Empire no longer exists, that Britain is now a third-rate has-been nation of little importance, that the British Royal household is just a curiosity for tourists.  None of this is true. The first thing to recognize is that the British Empire is and always has been primarily a FINANCIAL EMPIRE, a global system of usury, speculation, and financial dominance by the City of London. The City of London created the global system of oligarchical supremacist private Central Banking cartel in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Today, that private oligarchical system has near dictatorial control over the monetary and financial policies of almost every nation of the planet, as the fate of hundreds of millions of human beings is decided by the controllers of the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the U.S. Federal Reserve, and similar institutions. The City of London also created, in the 1960s and 70s the “offshore banking system,” imperial financial centers outside the control of sovereign nations, which today bankroll most of the world’s business in narcotics, illicit arms sales and human trafficking.  In the 18th century, the British Empire—which the 13 American colonies revolted against—had near monopoly control over global slave trafficking. In the 19th century the British Empire created global narcotics trafficking. Between 1815 and 1945 the British Empire killed more human beings than Hitler, Stalin and Mao Zedong combined. Unlike the American Republic, the British financial/economic system was never about human advancement or scientific and technological progress; it was a system of looting, exploitation, financial gain, and dominance by a monied oligarchy.  From 1776, down to the present day, the PRINCIPLES enunciated in our Declaration of Independence and the Preamble to our Constitution have been anathema to the British elites. They have spent decades attempting to eradicate these principles from American culture, and they have been determined to corrupt America’s role in the world, to subvert America into becoming the enforcer of British imperial designs.  “But” people say, “all of that is mostly in the past. I still don’t see Britain as a major factor today.”  The mistake here is that one must stop looking at the nation-state of Great Britain and look at the actual far-flung imperial financial empire that exists and that is centered in London. Look also at the role of the British elites in the Satanic cultural onslaught of recent years, such as the “climate change” campaign, championed by King Charles. Look at the speakers at any COP conference or World Economic Forum conference. The elites who control these conferences are neither “American imperialists” nor “Communists.”  British and other European oligarchical interests, together with their treasonous American partners, dominate these affairs. It is a world-wide web of central bankers, financial speculators, multinational corporations and billionaire-funded private foundations and trusts. These are the true enemies of our nation and of every other sovereign nation. This is the 21st century British Empire
i'm no fan but you'll replace with the unknown and that's worse. end up with a ceo ruining lives from some secret location.  like the tyrel corporation in the original bladerunner film
What about Mary, Queen of Scots?
Where is Robin Hood and his band of merry men...whoops...ther're at the pub...no..they are stuck on the consumerism merry go round...oh.dear
His coat of arms that his mother gave him from Birth Tell his last birthday
There is a Christian man I forget his name but he said that king Charles is the antichrist and he knows this because of his research in all of the That gave him On that fits !
I always find the argument that “the royal family bring in money through tourism” argument hilarious - so we wouldn’t get any tourism without the royal family? We have nothing else to offer? The country’s biggest benefit claimants as far as I’m concerned
I hear what your saying but wouldn't you trust the monarchy more than the government at present?
Such a pathetic person!!! He's not my king. I didn't vote for him...
If you hate the Royals  so much go & live in  a communist country & see how you fair there.
This former British soldier thoroughly agrees with you mate. They are Walts mostly!
Freemasons
and look at the men they have  given the knighthood ;  tony blair   kerr starmer  and so on and so forth.....
TOUCHE'
ON POINT
have a steak with some french fries, you will feel better
The biggest contradiction is for the Pensioners,.  Since the 1970's since it was introduced the £10 Christmas Bonus remains the same amount over 50 years.
Just get over it your a disgrace of the British army ! You were probably discharged for P.D.S the monarchy has been around for thousands of years no one in the world has .
Charles has his tongue up the WEF.  There is no more to be said.
Spot on joe 👍🏿
There’s always one vocal idiot and here’s todays!! To this soldier who has lived nowhere else or experienced any other government oversight needs to get out to see what is actually happening!!  Your delusional dude!! So funny all these idiots going on about the House of Lords!!  Especially Americans as they have the most aggressive House of Lords in their lobbyists!! The mega rich OWN American politicians lock stock and barrel!!
I believe, just as there were minimal people at the Queens funeral,  there will be even less people at, NoT my king sausage fingers fancy role playing party.  Its true, they have to go, the sooner the better.  Once we get rid of Tories and Labour and vote for UK-Reform. We may stand a chance with a referendum brought about by the people. I only admire Harry, he stuck two fingers up to the lot of them.
A council house. Yeah. Actually, I have long since said the Buckingham Palace is the largest council house. Dare I add, apparently I have Cromwell on my grandmother's side. Nuff said.
Read Tim Cohen's "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea".  After years of research he has concluded that King Charles III is THE antichrist.  His coat of arms, which were tailored only for him, exactly match the description of the antichrist in Rev. 13.  His name, and no other of any world leaders, equal 666 in Germatria.  He was awarded a statue in 2004 in South America that proclaimed him 'savior of the world'.  Think about it: he's the top globalist in the world, who pushes all the New World Order agendas.  He has unlimited wealth and influence.  He claims to have Jewish ancestry.  He asked for fealty at his coronation from ALL world citizens, not just Britons.
I've always been creeped out by THEM. After DIANA'S MURDER , IVE DESPISED THE ROYALS.  Don't get me started on Charles old best friend JIMMY SAVILE!! #monstersarereal #evilbloodlines #windsors
Ì dont like and don't trust Charles at all he is a creep
Cash for honours Charlie, corrupt as hell.
The British Royal family are one of the psychopathic dynasties that form the illuminati.
Why are they all druids? What is their base religion? Were they the Picts? Or Gael?   All I know is the Queen seemed to hold the degenerates at bay. And now the mice will play.   All jokes aside, Charles is the head of the WEF great reset.
It costs £0.77p per person in the U.K. to fund everything related to the Royal Family.
Absolutely everybody learns about Oliver Cromwell.  What is he on about?
He ought to vacation in mullaghmore
Why is he so obsessed with the wealth of the Crown and not that if the politicians and corporate globalists who would quickly rob and eradicate forever the nation’s heritage?
There are many billionaires in this world.  Does he think that taking the royal lands and houses away from our national ambassadors means he will get some of it?  How far does he think that money would go?  He’s not very good at maths is he?   Should we invite foreign dignitaries to some random housing estate or hotel?
I am often embarrassed by the atrocities of the past, committed by colonialists. So many riches stolen from other countries, to that other country's demise. How the arrogance of the British historically labelled other nations "barbaric"! I teach students from all over the world, I find myself constantly apologising for history. I have absolutely no respect whatsoever for the monarchy or the class and status system they promote. Will the UK ever become a country with equal values for everyone. I highly doubt it with the current parliament that has been in existence since goodness knows when. Self elected pompous individuals who have zero understanding of the common man's plight or daily struggles. The inequality will continue. The UK will continue to fall apart at the seams. The system is broken and wholly dysfunctional....and that's precisely how they want it.
This envious ignorant fool has no understanding of the duties performed by the royal family.  Imagine the money that would have to be spent getting a group of others trained to that standard of dignity and decorum and have them agree to be on duty 24/7, abstaining from any questionable conduct every day if their lives?
Love that expression, bunch of inbred royals 🤣👍🥇
It is far better to raise a random person, groomed from birth to hold the role as an embodiment of the nation for public events than some embarrassment of a politician.
My man finally found someone like minded ❤
Most countries spend more electing colourless dull political figureheads to do the same role.
I visited Osbourne House on the Isle of Wight last year. After being bullied by one idiot 'guide' even though the public owns that house, another decent guide asked me if I knew how Victoria became the Empress. Essentially it was because she was jealous of the German Kaiser since he outranked her so she started a war, killing hundreds of thousands of Indians so that she could outrank a german. Evil British monarchy. It's embarassing to have them in this country.
Speak your truth ❤❤❤❤❤
I never like british kingdom
Fat fingers! 😂
I’m no Royalist, but this guy is just making a Pratt of himself.
The word "King" has no meaning in reality - It's simply self delusion - but he works for the money printers, playing his role, so he wont be going anywhere anytime soon. All the other stuff is irrelevant
Sadly, Lydon has become a right wing Monarchist tool.
Best mates with Jimmy Saville. Nuff said.
They shut us down but we don't go away.
WORSHIP OF A FAKE FAMILY 💯  slaves to the fake so called royal family, every family should be royal family but have one president 💯.   British people are brain washed to think fake family are special family what a lie..
Yep. And they take a portion of my money as tax. I’m was over here in Canada 🇨🇦
Apart from the Monarchy, you probably hated the army and definitely hate this country. I suggest you go to somewhere where you would feel more at home,  I would suggest Russia. I am sure Mr Putin would appreciate your constructive criticism.
Royalty brings its own privileges. It’s been this way for centuries. Only now, with the ever present media are people speaking up. Do you seriously think that things are going to change anytime soon?
When oh when Will the british people realise  that the monarchy work for the  Papacy ,doing its bidding militarily and financially and religiously  They all serve the King of Rome ,their Holy See  by their Fleet Admiral military  The british are blind lost sheep for the slaughter
You’re just a socialist! You just don’t like people getting on and making something for themselves! There will always be people who are in power , this socialist bollocks that everyone should be equal is Disneyland stuff!
I detest republics, because all the creepy little men are trying to be the king.  They'll do anything for that power 🤨🇬🇧😅😅😅
They do pay tax - remember??? 🇬🇧🤨
Doctors hard up and badly paid, you have to be joking!!
A well overdue criticism. I'm always nonplussed by support for royalty from the working classes. I won't see it in my lifetime but surely we must become The Republic of Britain.
I thought that it was our gvt who are in charge of poverty
ANY  ENGLISHMAN is a COWARD in my and many others eyes.   Why ?  Get behind real TRUTH of 'OPERATION SCORCHED EARTH '  against a HANDFUL of BOER COMMANDOS  and HOW the ENGLISH  ' WON THE WAR ' .     By KILLING THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS,  BURNING THEIR FARMS AND STEALING THEIR LIVESTOCK.   WHAT ,  DO YOU CALL SOMEONE DOING THAT ?
Bunch of Greek and Germans and I’m a Celtic man so they are not for me!
Ok, the presenter hates the monarchy, we get it. A long string of insults and childish name calling hardly amounts to a contribution to debate. The presenter seems to be a person of moderate intelligence who also appears to think that using extravagantly negative terminology about individuals amounts to an argument. It doesn't.
They're bloody German that should tell you everything. Not one drop of British blood there. They were inserted re Rothschilds. Follow the bloodlines, follow the money.
Your kings and Queens have.trampled our nation and supported terrorist organisations against us.
You are entitled to your opinion but what a disgrace to your former employer
Aleister Crowley.  Free Masons. Khazarians. And worse.
Brits bend there knee to gangsters and an antichrist.
PuRE EVil
Very well said.  End the monarchy now!
It is absolutely ridiculous and make me laugh at how they parade around like it's still medieval times.  I actually feel sorry for them when I see how hard they are trying to hang on to this outdated show.  The world has progressed way beyond this.
That's how easy it is to deceive people.  All the billions of people worshipping, admiring these pedophiles and criminals, unable to look beyond the surface of their hand waving, the smile and of course can't have all that without the glamour.  All that with the tax payer's money.  People who love the monarchy are certainly getting their money's worth.
Good video telling the truth. The royals are disgusting bunch of snobs. They should have kept Diana with Security & wonder if she had lived what would the Royals really be. Sad
The root of all inequality is nature, not the persons nature treated well and made intelligent, productive, inventive and entrepreneurial or dumb,  passive,  irresponsible and submissive.  Every attempt to change this and eliminate the products of the productive and to elevate the dumb and destructive leads to new and devastating inequalities and a bad life for all. This man can only think in cliches and see life in his envious perspective and hate of the reality of existence on this planet.
Not MY King.
The Sex Pistols  all hung out on Kings Road, Chelsea, they were a business in the end! Not from a wokring class mining town and making music in a mining town.
Wow it's about time someone had the balls to speak the truth
stop voting electing playing their game ...time for new ideas they cant arrest and round everyone up ...see your collective power for once the people are the only true power , stop being scammed ,,,you are the greatest resource on the planet , stop giving it to the top it is you that produce and service everything , with out people theres noting , stop asking for better , start telling them how its going to be ,,,now expand this world wide ..its time you know it is you feel it ...the times now
agree with you 100 % mate have done all me life . people are blind dumb and ill informed which is why the elites refer to them as cattle
Terrorist.
What does the UK have except the Monarchy that will have people from all over the world (who is willing to spend their money) to come  to the UK The Monarchy cost every taxpayer in the UK less then £1 a year You sound like a steetpreacher standing on a soapbox on the corner
Your words are ABSOLUTELY TRUE… the Free Masons are ruling Britain… HOW SAD !!!!!!
fuck the royals
As an ex serviceman (australian) we had a vote about 10 years ago, to get rid of the Monarchy.. We decided not to. History shows that cutting your Kings head off resulted in the rise of a tyrant. After Cromwells death James 11 was invited to take up the vacancy. As an institution the Kings position denies the possibility of the rise of a dictator. "the Monarchy' is the last impediment to an act of stupidity". think of the kings position as being the final arbitrator. You need to get rid of the Sqaudie mentality.
You should be disgusted with yourself - you swore an oath to protect the monarchy.
I support your viewpoint about the parasites sitting on their thrones in Britain wholeheartedly.  When I was 8 yrs. old the newly crowned Elizabeth and her sidekick Philip came to our town to visit the Battlefield Monument, erected in Stoney Creek, Ontario to celebrate the British winning the War of 1812 over the American invaders. Our whole public school, from grades 1 to 8, were taught to bow and curtsy beforehand.  As her convertible came up the drive with Elizabeth and Philip seated in it, all of us school children bowed and curtsied to them, all except me that is.  Philip stood up when he saw me standing there so I gave a quick bob in their direction, having made my point.   My dad had been a WWII veteran, but also French Acadian by birth, so I grew up listening to stories about the Great Expulsion of 1755 at Grand Pre, N.S.  The British soldiers forced the Acadian people into boats, thereby separating families from one another. never to be reunited again.  My dad had to fight under the British flag in WWII, as Canada didn't even have its own flag at the time.  I have observed how the British public are brainwashed into worshipping the royals, who are German, right from the cradle on up.  When Charles, who became a billionaire upon his mother's death, made the British taxpayers pay 100 million pounds for his coronation, that was the last straw for me.  They are relics of a bygone age, when the royals gave their ship captains the authority to commit piracy on the high seas against all other countries.  Their time in power is slowly coming to an end, with only a few deluded people still in awe of this "firm" of loafers masquerading as noble and caring people.
Kings Charles, commander in chief of the Land thieves, in 1649 they took by force the last of the common land with the Land Enclosures!. Taking OUR land then forcing us to pay rent & taxs to live on the on our own Land, enslaving us into being worker subjects, and setting themselves up as Lords and Barons, thugs & gangsters!. Land is Freedom!. 🌎✊🏽 Never forget the Diggers & St George’s Hill. Billy Bragg the Diggers Song with Lyrics- https://youtu.be/YwQwA_kFxoE?si=Rekc8IX0jLVCm6uX
Charles is a right flog with his ho by his side ,a right royal joke
😮I like your show I think I'll be back
yes they are criminals 👿
For me it was interview where Prince Philip agrees with depopulation. Masonic scum.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
I don't watch their weddings coronations and the like. But most shockingly I never realised how fat his fingers are.
Actually, her late majesty paid taxes so do research
It makes me see red when you see the royals wearing a breast full of medals that's a joke what have they done to earn those medals.  My father fought  in the second world war on the PQ17 convoys getting planes submarines and anything else Germany had to fire at them in Antarctic conditions or our army and air force bravely fighting for our liberty.  My father didn't want his medals he said he was one of the lucky ones , the Royal family are  barefaced jokers WHAT HIPOCRACY !!!! Regard Mark.  PS I have been living on the bread line as a psychiatric staff nurse what the hell did they do for there fellow man....
All societies have a top and a bottom. Unavoidable my old chum. Our monarchy are the envy of the world. You talk of a proud tradition of revolution. Thing is, revolution is violent and people die and chaos ensues, before there then develops another top and bottom. Your bitterness has enveloped you. I wouldn't be royal for a gold clock. Difficult whole of life job if you ask me.
Your video is gone. It will be taken down
What a lousy soldier you must have been!    The Royals are worth a fortune to the nation. Get real and drop your ranting.
In a modern society, the monarchy is a ridiculous anachronism which should have been dissolved decades ago. These degenerates do have a habit of rubbing shoulders with unsavory dictators and other ne'er do wells. It's too bad that there still exist a lot of easily-duped "commoners" who are dazzled by this garish celebrity cult of real estate thieves.
Wow, that was an incisive swipe, inspirational, i shall be sampling some of that for a tune, brilliant man, fucking right on.
Very first video ive seen on this channel. I subbed about 1 min into it. Not normal for me at ALL!
My ancestors executed Queen Victoria in 1838 for the crimes of her family with the opium pandemic, then ruled with a Great Great Uncle as the Queen for the 45 year great peace, then the Privy Council put in a Rothschilds Puppet after that.
Charles spotted a classical building being upgraded & didn't like it's new look. He complained to the owner, a Saudi Prince, who immediately shut it down, putting hundreds of men out of work.  Men tossed out of work, because of Charlie's delicate artistic sensibilities. You can't really blame Harry, for putting distance between himself & his toxic family.
Well said. Could not agree with you more!
Great vid
The only thing I can say in defence of a monarchy is that the countries who have one is that they seem to be more stable than the countries who have a dictator
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
As a Canadian it's irksome that we help prop them up... a figurehead we absolutely do not need or want
It is weird that the royals wear so many unearned medals and military uniforms.
Love this guy he's got them pegged 😊
The difference between France and the England is that people have not yet reached a stage of total frustration and poverty and the poorest amongst them manage to survive on a mundane job paying a low wage supplemented by government benefits. You can see it emerge from time to time when the Government keep a "revolt" at bay by raising benefits or the minimum wage in effect throwing a "gift" to the working class and therefore making them dependent on the Government at large, in effect buying the loyalty of the masses. But it will change. It will be the young who will demand and get or take a larger slice of the cake and decide what role if any, the Royal family play in future. It will not be nice.
Where’s the inheritance tax? Parasites the lot 🤡
Republics have their own 'top dogs' so very little would change in a society. It's human nature and I'd rather have the King than the likes of Bill Clinton or Biden.
I don't want them but if they go we will have no magna carta
Bloody parasites and Charlie's on the  epstien list
Was he ever a paratrooper???
Thankyou,thankyou,thankyou.bunch of entitled snobs
Well said… I will b so glad when people start worshipping themselves
There will always be the haves and the have nots and the have nots will always wish they were the haves and the haves will never wish they were the have nots. There will be those who ride the wagon while someone pulls or pushes but everyone can't ride at the same time. It is what it is.
HMRC tax monsters....!
Part of the parasitic crowd. The greed and unfairness of life today.
Wow, mind changing stuff as an Aussie who never really thought about it like this. 😊
If Charles doesn't have the obligation forced on him to oay taxes, why would he choose to pay them even though he doesn't have to. I'm not convinced h is bad. You woul still have to pay a corrupt president who gets exchanged for another one you can't keep tabs on. I choose royalty. The ones that do wrong get disgraced. Like you should be,
If you put them in a council house Charles would get help for his learning disability
Bravo
I agree with you 100%. Wish your video would have been longer and more information about. “ the firm “.     Thank you
100% agree!.. we need to take back our country from these demonic cretins!.. who do nothing but keep us down so that they can stay above us all!..they think we need them in the hard times. (Whitch they have created).. But really, we just need each other. We are a powerful force when we are a collective.... hence why they are trying to make us argue amongst ourselves. (To make each others the enemy!..... keep focused on the really problems....not the distractions!
I would never support a man who spent his wedding night  on the phone with his lover. Duhh
How any population can accept these symbols of oppression is unbelievable it really is a visible farce because they are all gangsters in fancy dress.
ROYALS  RAPE  ??    PROVED
Many thanks for this, well done, I am sure very many feel for what you show here, I know many Folks I speak to also ask why, when a Member of Parliament was sadly murdered, on those two occasions in recent years, did the killers instantly receive whole of life sentences, but when a member of the public is murdered, it seems any old sentence from just a few months to around twenty three years seems to fit the bill!
Palestina  right now is paying the putrefaction of the monarchy and arrogance of England. England is full of Karma
Imagine lots of crazy people standing around you while you play dressing up in a make believe ceremony while so many other awake people are watching a tragic  example of self delusion. Bad parenting I say
So, you’re oath meant nothing to you?
What a load of rubbish Joe you talk, yes, sometimes we all make comments, not very nice ones against the Royal Family, but on the whole I would prefer what we have than a President and it's cheaper too. I expect you would follow Hitler, Putin or even the Bolshevist's so all Royals would be eliminated in the world, and then what????
Don't forget there half Greek there not pure Anglo Saxons not pure there Wogs. 🐊
Charlies is a bloody disgrace he sold the UK out for the WEF WHO NATO AND UN. And they will turn on Charlie and his family but he deserves it the nobhead and rich will look after there own and sell the British people down the river...
Its not as constitional monarchy, as the uk has no constitution. Thats Australia and Canada
King of what?...England...living iff people like parasites...Good report!
It’s up to you the government they look after the money, they started paying tax some years ago. The government won’t give anything to people who needed it.
Is  right soldier
I think we should definitely keep the royal family, if only for tourism. Just take away the money and power, trim the deadwood. Just like a living waxworks. We do have one of richest histories in the world, but we need to get real.
my opinion of them is pretty low .
filthy bloodline
Does the royal family use any of their personal wealth to fight wars or did we pay for ww2 and other wars.
Very eloquent stuff. But you omit to mention that the King was the  the champion of the people  against the cruelty and repression  of the  aristocratic few., for centuries in Britain. If you get rid of  the monarch who is now a  figurehead , an expression of of  many  political conflicts in   progress, you will probably end up with an arrogant and  cruel aristocracy again, because their pursuit of  vested interests will  lead that way.
The royal family give a lot of enjoyment to many of us. How grey and dull it would be if you had them in council houses. Sounds a teeny bit jealous when you mention the size of someone’s coffee. Just get yourself something more productive to do! Oh that’s what you want the king to do!!
Great vid. Thanks. Listen, whether they are gangsters or not I couldn't say. They DO have something in Common with Sopranos or Corleones. Family comes first. ALWAYS. Charles will cover for Andrew because they aren't that different. He won't evict him. In fact the Queen and Charles paid off Roberts/ Giuffre between them. There is no way Andrew had $ 12 million cash. Also Epstein was a regular in Balmoral and Buckingham Palace. Don't tell me the Queen didn't know who or what he was. I 'very read he even provided some financial services for her. She was a notorious tax dodger. See Panama Papers etc etc One can go on and on.  As a soldier you had to swear loyalty to the monarch. Not the British people. Ditto all the armed forces and police. I am not saying that that necessarily means the police and armed forces are regressive. They are not, mostly. BUT. during the coronation people holding placards with NOT MY KING on them were arrested and roughed up  One guy was holding up a BLANK SHEET OF PAPER. He was arrested beaten and charged with ????? exactly?? Breach of the peace, hurting Camilla's feelings. F**k knows. That's England. Not North Korea or Putin's Russia. England in 2023. Not 1623, notice.
When I watched a documentary on the peadophile bishop (Peter Ball, I think) and learned that he was "friends" with Prince Charles (as he was then) who bought him a house in the Duchy of Cornwall allowing to live his life out. That was me completely finished with the Royals - if the Diana debacle was not enough. I have also learned that ALL the royals were at Xmas services at Sandringham including the ex Duke and Duchess of Pork Andrew and Fergie  (if they are ex royals, on the basis of this they are just bubbling under waiting for the time when they can be considered acceptable again.   When you think that only 33000 people could be bothered to file past the late Queen's coffin in Edinburgh and that there are approximately 5 million in Scotland that's not even one percent of the populace. I hope I see the day when we are a republic.
I agree. Here in the Netherlands we also have organised crime by the name of Oranje Nassau.
Former British Soldier EXPOSES King Charles
Charlie used to go with that camillion to Arab countries begging bowl in hand for cash handouts. Came all out to support Ukraine and now sits with his mouth sealed witnessing the GENOCIDE IN GAZA.
As the Bible says wolfs insheeps clothing,there AntiChrist, repent and believe in Jesus!
Well said im republican
You made your pledge to the monarch as a soldier what now?
Wait a minute if we change the regime all thos wannaboos only have a piece of paper from the old queen to say they should be here 😑
Well said that man
Time it was a republic the dated fairytale stuff is over there is absolutely no purpose in this bs anymore.
advanced case of military cosplay 🤣
We do nothing
Sorry buddy, respect you for your service but you have a minority view. Would you want to see a president Blair or Hamza Yousef.
Andrew is just the only one so far that was caught, they are all into the same sicko stuff!
I get that the monarchy feels special and it is to many.  Problem is they are globalists and they are arrogant and believe they know what you need and are working to ensure your reality is of their choosing.   What a way to go.
The Royals bring in money? The Royals killed their Golden Goose!
Sounds more like Join the communist party to me..But each to his own .
A very well thought out condemnation of the Monarchy. The problem with it is that the other side of the coin isn’t mentioned. A head of state such as Jeremy Corbyn or Sir Keir Starmer doesn’t actually fill one with joy and anticipation of what they would get up to with unfettered power. At least the current system does have checks and balances. Socialists never seem able to contain their ambitions once in power. The resulting chaos takes years to undo. Nett Zero, Climate Change and the Covid debacle are all causes dear to Left and all are the result of ‘progressive’ thinking. Classic examples of Mass Formation Psychosis or more commonly described as Group Think. Very sad situation we are in in the U.K. at the moment.
This guy is being paid by a bunch of anti Royals republicans
Whilst it's tedious listening to you fawning over that socialism thing that's driven by envy and never worked, you are right about Charles, but for the wrong reason. We need rid of him because he's in deep with the World Economic Forum, which is very close to imposing on us the biggest disaster of control that will dictate every aspect of our lives, via digital IDs, central bank digital currency and social scoring, with isolation in 15 minute ghettos, no personal mobility and ownership of nothing. I don't believe Charles understands this, he's there because of the WEF's illusion of climate change activism. He's too dumb to see the big picture, even though the WEF is quite open about its agenda.
Well said, i agree totally.
Yes KC to me has done it for me. The RF are taking the money not giving it to charities. They take but do not give to charities. How do they get the amount of money they receive for what cutting ribbons and huge dinner parties, while other people go hungry. KC, PA MM Halfwit and Fergoforget have been linked to some unsavoury people link with the Middle east, also Pedies. They are corrupt. I think PW, PC and children, Edward Wife and children are clean, but the others sry corrupt.
“You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.” ― Buckminster Fuller
What a sad little man. I guess this is the way you want to make a name for yourself. You think putting someone down makes you bigger. It doesn't. It shows everyone who and what you really are. A nobody.
It baffles me that people fall for all the royalist bullshit. Back in the 12th century, maybe, but not in the modern era. They have so much wealth its impossible to quantify yet we give them millions every year without question. Society is unevenly balanced and the rich always get richer. They should be taxed accordingly, frozen from the public use and relegated to the past, we dont need them. Fuck the royals, fuck the tories, fuck the rich.
Spot on. More people should see this video.
You worked for that gangster mush
You're a disgrace.
I have absolutely zero respect for the monarchy, what makes their family any more important than anyone else's in this country. Its an old antiquated system that really does not belong in modern society and should be thrown out.
He’s right about the Royals however, he neglects to mention the Roth Childs. They make the Royals seem like neighborhood bullies. These psychopaths are satanic the overlords.❤
Thanks for the sex pistols. ❤❤
All those people in power are corrupt royalty, politicians not to mention the pharmaceutical head., and lots more .
It's  arguable that   ANYONE    who desires such power that they are The President of  USA, or the leader of any country possesses an element of a number of personality traits. For example, narcissism, arrogance, ruthlessness  ; even sociopathy. You cited the prime example yourself.  Oliver Cromwell had the courage and charisma to create a rebellion against the Monarchy, the King was executed and surprisingly soon he himself became corrupt, finding himself being executed.  In my humble opinion Cromwell is an example of how Absolute  Power destroys    ABSOLUTELY  .  That said, I  would hate to see vile , self seeking, loathsome characters like Donald Trump,  David Cameron or Boris Johnson having the power that a member of the royal family has.  The Trumps and Johnsons of this world   FIGHT    for power. Prince William is born to reluctant power and seems to make genuine efforts to show the public that he, at least,  tries to care. Throughout time who can we say sat in power and made a marvellous, untinged job of it  ?  The Pilgrim Fathers left England for America and decimated the indigenous people and later had a civil war. The Australians also disempowered the indigenous people. Both countries continue to squash those people who lived there by right.
So why hasn’t the king stepped in to stop our country from being wrecked !
He has failed quite dismally to prove anything, but then what do expect from a Republican.  Not the most pointed pencils in the box. Who the hell is Joe Clenton & why should I give a fuck what he thinks??  We dealt with one awhile ago, who actually killed the king.  He didn't fare too well if I remember rightly.  As a Soldier you swore an oath to fight for the Monarch shows how little an oath means to you.  My family swore a similar oath a 1000 years ago to protect King & Country & we still keep it.
Aren't they from Germany anyway
Mate you are the voice of us all and thank for saying what we are thinking lm not sure where you drink let me know and l would be more than happy to buy you a pint or two for your honesty and free speech
Three things keep the British population from attaining their potential: The Monarchy, the Established Church, and the House of Lords. For Britain to go forward and show its greatness, all three have to go.
Hes not my King
I think he’s taken us all for the c word cite here. Not to long ago KG 6 was forced to abdicate and live his life in exile for marrying a divorcee. Charles was screwing mrs Adam’s, I call her that for her stunning beauty. Not only married her be had her coronated to become our queen.  He should abdicate immediately and give all of his riches to the poor. How many flats could be made out of all the royal buildings. Ans such flats should be council run and they should not allow any governmental figure, or wealthy person. No tennant purchase to be allowed.  I could go on for hours about how wrong it really is for the country to support them in any way.
yes 100 percent they gangster's robbing millions and millions of pounds from normal people not my king big ears 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The People Rejoice When Evil Is Overthrown!  King Charles/Klaus Schwab. 😈
That’s their job to be ambassadors for England. Ensuring we get contracts. It’s very boring if you attend these functions at British embassy functions
💯 % Agree
Charles is a weak Man weak man creating hard times.
Not much has changed? Anything can bring in money if it is sensationalised?!
Love Joe Glenton! Keep enlightening us x
MAGNA CARTA 1215 ...... federal reserve to be owened by the people the state the country with zero percent interest to government! And Rothschild crime families criminal control on federal reserve charging interest! Debt Slaves.... the people the slaves.... the citizens.... the peasants .....🎰🎭☠️
Blood suckers
Said it all. The elite are at the top of the pyramid. To preserve their life of Reilly, they have to keep the people, (The working slave drones), ill, poor and divided/subjugated/amused.  The entire political system is designed around keeping the small group of rich barons in wealth and all of  us poor, forever.
He is the devil
Charles is creepy just like his father 😈
What amuses and disgusts me is when we join up, we swear allegiance to the crown and country. When have you ever heard the crown speak out in support of our armed forces when they are sent out to fight illegal wars with inadequate equipment and support.Yes you got it-never.
great  expectations;  you will do well in politics in this current madness , super intelligent observation, but I don’t necessarily agree with your whole awareness, for ego does get in the way of true observation. I personally loved our queen for her true values of knowing and believing in oneself
Best buddies with Jim Sav 😒
This former soldier speaks the truth
Monty Python should be running the tiny island.
They aren't even English, winsdor is a made up name. Fn German kaniggets.
I was expecting something a bit more intellectual than a resentful dude saying we should abolish the monarcy because of charles' 'chubby fingers'
This is a trip into La la land according to this deranged fool almost comedian. Having an elected head of state would not give you a run off between Edwina Currie and Ken Livingstone type populist at the time. You can forget any romanticised ideas of J.R.Hartley type figure they do not exist in UK Politics in 2023. Crazy points made 1/ You would have better fashion and better hair, like the French. Plenty of republics no one can say that it's even true. Just Anti-British rhetoric in practice. 2/ They do not serve in the Military well they do generally apart from those who marry in they overwhelming do and even there you can military people look at two of Princess Royal Anne's. Husbands. 3/ Punk rockers -Sex pistols were obnoxious Anarchists who believed in nothing much beyond they do not like anything or anyone much. 4/ They do not teach the English civil war  and the Putney debates well they do. Deliberate misinformation. I could go on but you are entitled not to like the institution and also the people in it. But please be fair they also have dull meetings to attend and yes sometimes the world can smell of new paint. They basically usually work on beyond normal retirement age and to the detriment of the health frankly. The Queen did far too much for many years and it would be strain for anyone and should have been cut back and let others do things. You let your service down that is also something you have to live with. Final point you say about deference do you believe Super Heroes  are a healthy concept the NHS does not allow Doctors and Nurses to be trained so they are got from abroad instead less educated often. Your delusions of Doctors at food banks is absurd. Nurses can earn over £200,000 a year 9 to 5 job. They do not get paid a pittance the military is where pay needs prioritising as you put your life on the line and your health. Do say thank you for the over 10 million estimated deaths for Covid19 let alone the amount on the National debt and social separation and business and lives destroyed. All for Super Heroes instead of responsible public health policy. So you also blinkered on that.
Is this no treason
The biggest mafia that's ever been. We've been duped all along. But if we rise up their armies will kill us off.
The U.K. is welcome to this rubbish. Makes a change from invading, meddling and murdering, which is what you are best at. 👎
Who murdered Princess Diana?
God save old ALBION 🙏🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿✌️
They aren't even Windsors , thats a made up name because of WW1 . They are German , they are Coburg . 😊
He got Diana killed
The Windsors are actually German, Saxa Coburg Gotha was their family name up until the late 1800s
What an utterly ignorant assessment of the Royal Family by a former serviceman who should know better.
Brilliant.
WOW 🎉🎉🎉 l agree
Well said ! 👍
Ah stop france has been a mess since the revolution...napoleon quickly followed ...lol what a mess that was ....and their empire has fallen as quick as the brits since the monarchy was got rid of ..it was not the Kings fault or marie antoinete that the crops failed , it was because a big  volcano went off  in Iceland  A stupid revolution that led to nothing better ...im not defending the monarchy( I'm irish )belive me I'm not...however the words of Oliver cromwell ring In my ears at times , "give the power to the people and they will hand it right back " Now that's just giving the devil his due .
Blimey, did you feel like that when you made your pledge of allegiance to the late Majesty and all her heirs and successors and signed the Official Secrets Act.  I think your a disgrace to the Armed Forces and thank god you are out!
I don’t think the French are now doing any better with their globalist leader. You showed photos from France from about fifty years ago!  If the leaders, whether monarchs or elected officials, don’t have the best interests of their nation’s people at heart then the country and people will suffer. Enoch was right. We need true nationalists to run our countries not these Bolshevik globalists.
Charles has done nothing for Royal family
The Windsors are a sickness in UK, and would be thrown off most council estates. They'd NOT be tolerated having Jimmy Savile, Brian Epstein etc round for tea. Nor get away with knighting war criminals like Tony Blair. They use the British Army for their foreign affairs as henchmen to the mafias, while UK gets no protection from 1000's of invaders.
You are the pinnacle of someone who is bitter because you have never amounted to nothing after leaving the military. Probably because you were giving everything in the military (Free healthcare, cheap accommodation, cheap food, good pension and more) and then when you left you didn’t know what to do but to blame the government and royal family.  This is coming from someone who has also served 👌
Show the Royals the door!
Well said….
Totally agree!!! The royals are all carpetbaggers who live the life of Riley. They are an obsolute institution who utilize history to justify their entitled existence. Bring on the Republic.
I dislike Charley sausage fingers  immensely, I don't forget how he treated diana, he should have passed the crown to William, it's a fecking joke that an adulterer became the queen of england, I truly dislike the pair of them.
Well said mate
Oliver Cromwell.. as an Irish man, he, to me, is on parity with the likes of pol pott, pinochet and the likes. What he did to the irish people was nothing short of genocide.  There is a street in Drogheda (county louth) called scarlet street. Its called that due to the blood that poured down it when Cromwell butchered the natives.
There is a clear, crystal clear connection between the Windsor criminals and human trafficking and drug trafficking! Why are there so many paedophiles surrounding the British Royal family? Jimmy Saville, Jeffrey Epstein, the Queens Butler Kidd, Rolf Harris, Lord Mountbatten and the list is endless?
👌👌
Shite Sire your starting talk like a.   a.    a.   a.  a.   follow Australian.
Revolutions are destructive orgies, uncontrollable by definition but so easily exploited by the worst most thuggish elements lurking on the sidelines poised to take advantage. We have a constitutional monarchy, be thankful you do not live in a republic with a Biden or a Putin in charge.
Well said the royal family are gangsters. Above the law wake up now
I started listening to this but am disappointed to find a grumpy diatribe which seems to be based on the 'me, me, me culture.  Nothing is ever 'FAIR'.  Get real. KCIII is not my favourite monarch - I don't like his wokeness, but I do think this country has done well over the centuries by being a monarchy.
Bring back Diana
This hasn't aged well.
You disgust me! I think you’ll find they’ve been paying tax for years! Treason!
I am a true monarchist yet it’s Jesus Christ who is my King & in the very near future these people who where put into power will have to kneel before our righteous God, as will all non believers and give an account for their actions🙌🏻✝️🙌🏻 John 3 v 16-17🙏🏻
I hate it when the media tell us how much the clothes cost that they are wearing ,that's where l draw the line ,rich and untitled people make me sick ,they wouldn't know what a hard day of work means
What a bitter, biased diatribe from someone who needs to cite his army experience to gain credence.
Well said Joe! Poignant as always and love how you contextualise a leftist framework of our history. So many of us only think of British history as imperialism and nothing more when there’s so much inspiration to be found with the peasants revolt, the levellers, the chartists, peterloo and so on. Tony Benn was a massive advocate for this type of narrative god rest his soul and he inspired me so much to challenge my reductionist view of history. I feel like the only way we on the left can combat xenophobic nationalism is with a progressive leftist view of civic nationalism and pride in who we are and our comrades before us. “Standing on the shoulders of giants”. Patriotism doesn’t have to be exclusively right-wing, we have a story to tell as well we just need more people to embrace it and help spread it.
They can be vicious among themselves…not a joke…
I am ex-British Army and I am not a fan of the Royal Family however, I am an English Constitutionalist so I understand the importance of Monarchy. Its a fact that the English have (always with the exception of the Cromwell years) always wanted a King and not a President. It is imperative that people understand our English Constitution because that can empower them. I stopped paying council tax back in 2008 because its created unLawfully. When Charles recently took his oath a contract between him and the people, he swore to uphold the Ancient Laws of England. We have to hold him to it, those Ancient Laws are our Constitutional Laws. This is what the oath system is based on and this is what binds us together as a Nation. The Levellers were Catholics who wanted to hand the country over to the Pope the English Protestants have always resisted EU tyrants they fought against Napoleon and Hitler. Now we have the Marxists who control this country and they are happy to sell us out to the EU and push us into a dystopian New World Order.
The only king , My king is Yahushua Mashiyah (Jesus Christ), who died for  everyone's the Sins, would he lay his life down for his people.?
Now Loyalists, you have heard it from the horse's mouth, come to Dublin.
The politics of envy writ large!
Brilliant ❤👏
The older and wiser you get you realise all these big establishment are just huge gravy trains . That take the tax payers money without their consent ! Note royal family, the BBC , the house of lords , you can go on and on !
They are people with no worries in the world , they have millions in the bank. By the time he was 20/21 he had millions , they do not care about the ordinary citizens at all It's an illusion, so we go along with the scam they put out. Rip off brition by the so-called Royals.
How did the first tribal leaders become kings? Brute force and determination yes, but that isn't how Charles or Elizabeth or how anyone got their crowns since Henry VII is it? Activism is in your blood, Its not the monarchies fault that you were court marshalled and convicted whatever the moral argument's were/are. Your just a professional misery guts.
I am deeply shocked that this video is even still up. And that this man has not gone MIA out of action 💀
Insane amount of planning needed to overthrow any monarchy and you need 80% to be fullt against...and  tooled up. Not sure it is possible
You sound like a crowd of Communists and Labour party members!!!!!!
Nothing but a bunch of parasites on a grand scale.
I'm definitely not a royalist anymore, simply I don't like what he stands for , all faiths, mass immigration, he's always been a c
There is only one KING-JESUS CHRIST ❤
What’s wrong with people that live in a council house? 🤔
That was tremendous!
Correction: Attend public events, shake hands, nod heads, smile and cut ribbons. 😂
King Charles  I never noticed his fingers before. Strange. Poor bloke perhaps he can’t get a doctors appointment it’s terrible these days.
Breath of fresh air. Total truth. Thanks for the vid, let's see where it takes us.
Sounds like the whole British system the royal family and the government all thieves and dishonest to the general man and woman in the UK
Cant wait til he has gone William and Kate will be the best
'Royal is as Royal does' in my book - So that's the Queen and Diana who even come close! so please don't upstage me Charles, and is Ped0 brother don't even rate as HB's with me.
The only two royals who have fought in conflicts are Andrew and Harry. So how ironic it was at the Queen funeral they were ordered not to wear their military uniforms and medals, while those royals who wouldn't know how to fire a gun and had never been in any conflict were bedecked in military uniforms covered in medals that were earned where??? The "Firm" really knows how to belittle those that do not conform to the royal script! The Windsor's and their hangers on are a scourge to the hard working tax payers. Make them damn well work at real jobs paying taxes like the rest of us!
I don't believe they bringing money it's disgusting how they get millions of taxpayers money while people work hard and taxed more they changed their name to Windsor
But would the countryside be built on.
What a traitor!
England has way more serious problem at the moment than worrying about the Monarchy.  The rate of refugees flooding into the country.  Muslims having control of government, leaders in crime and English people becoming a minority in their own country.  Concentrate your energy on those issues before you worry about the royals
Spot on geezer
Charlie boy is a big wef supporter participant research their goals and you will see he sees himself as an elite and gives no shits about the rest of humanity.
Yeah but you re a coward! Boo Fucking Hoo!
My father served onboard ship with the now king Charles and when i was younger would tell events that had happened ie.mucking in,getting hands dirty,standing his round etc but the big thing being is he had the respect of fellow sailor not because who he was but because of his actions and the fact he didnt want to be treated as a Prince,he was there with the same goal as everyone keep ship and shipmates safe and do the job at hand x
His coat of arms have symbols connected to the devil. Some people are saying his the anti christ.
Just one thing we need is a REPUBLIC.
i still reckon the monarchy mafia had diana knocked off because she was up the duff with  dodis child and we know what they think about mixed race children in the royal family
Sorry if I'm wrong but was I in mctc with you ?
Rats bro completely with you these scum are the biggest bums
Saxe-Coburg-Gotha = German 1
I have to agree with everything you've said in this excellent video - I loathe the royal family and everything associated with its lies and greed to perpetuate their existence.  On the other hand I admire the French who had the balls to rise up against their privileged tormentors and organise themselves to make a permanent change. Its absurd that with all their (unearned) wealth, they don't pay any taxes and own huge tracts of land which we are not permitted to set foot on. I am 62 and my brothers are also not monarchists, as are my sons so maybe there is a glimmer of hope that the day will come when we can rise against these parasites and free ourselves from their oppression. thanks for sharing your thoughts - well said!!!!

Look into his good friend Bishop Peter Ball and the letters of support he wrote to him.... #NonceKing
Jesus has the real power! Nothing the royals can do about that. Pray that they are right with God and have a personal relationship  with him.
US lost its republic on first bankruptcy 1871, European bankers like Rothschild's reseated US government and shortly after was relocated from Pittsburgh to DC. Every country has had a similar take over of government. UN Earth Summit in Rio 1992 where 178 of 209 countries signed UN Agenda 2021 and implemented UN in all levels of government. In Canada we have a petition e-4623 to remove UN from our government, over 60,000 signature, to be presented in Parliament in Feb 2024.
Came here to watch what the title suggests, and Ill I get is a yawn rant. Do not recommend channel ✅
Not my king
For me it beggars belief to see so many poor hard-working people having to use food banks, while being expected to accept the heads of this people living lives in unimaginable luxury.  The same kind of people using private jets and heavy-fuel-demand measures of transport, while preaching to the less well off to go “green”.  This as we head into 2024 for god’s sake.  We are told fairytales of equality and expected to believe in it.  What an insult!  But when it comes to defending our nation, whose sons spring to mind first?  Did  Tony Blair think of his sons leading the way to war?  And what are all those medals the RF display?  They make a mockery of all those lives fought and lost.
As a Kiwi, we need to get rid of the Monarchy, we would so benefit ❤
I find them pretty disgusting ...
The Royals.  Living off the fat of the land.
Thankyou for clearing things up !!   Because I was wondering how many horses does one family have to own?   And not to forget the properties .  Its just I don't really like people shoving their wealth into people's faces if you know what I mean.  The cost of living going up all over the world 🌎.      Australia 🦘
Well after this guy EXPOSED the king. I simply can't erase that from my brain, I've been scrubbing my eyeballs for hours. I can't unsee it...
Yeah, we knew a lot by the history Books, this is a terrible way to try and get famous. You should be asjamed, but looking at you. There's Is no shame in wouldn't call your soldier.

well said
i was a 11/ 12 yr old kid when Sex Pistols  first showed uo on tv. I never understood  the angst.  My British  friends were well into it....but it took  me years to get it.  I just lived inna loving family  and didnt  understand  the anger..even in 10 , 11 yr olds.
I believe the existence of monarchy has given people an unhealthy tolerance of inequality in humans. People with nothing defend the elites with their lives.
While i do think they're over privileged, they do bring in billions for the tourism industry. London is heaving with Americans, Germans & Chinese tourists, all year round. Also, the Monarch gives all revenue from the Crowns estates each year to the Government (£3billion in the last 8 years). In return the Government give the Monarch a yearly sum , with which they run "The Firm" as the Royals call thenselves.
He speaks totally rubbish.
£100 million for an adulterer and his mistress while the people suffer poverty absolutely diabolical...
Until the Queen passed I believed in the monarchy, but Charlie boy is a wrong un, steeped in the WEF, Bilderburg and god knows what else that goes against the ordinary Brits, the monarchy since the restoration is meant to be a figurehead for the nation, provide inspiration and direction for ordinary folk, this King and his brothers and children are not fit for the role, Anne is the genuine article in my opinion however. The monarchys time is up, an elected head of state is the way forward I truly believe. Regards from a Royal Navy veteran.
An insider said Princess Anne is the main commander of British armed forces.
isnt there a law that makes it illegal for you to talk like this?
Now now then what have we got here
Savilles best friend yet no one says anything
Yes
It absolutely astounds me but each to their own though, why people idolise these parasites?? They could not care about their public, in any way shape or form!! What are their purposes?? They should be seen in the same light as MP's...... self-serving narcissists who are corruptable to anything that lines their pockets. The flag-waving adulation disgusts me and people should wake up and possibly realise they're being very narrow minded and blinkered in their view of the Windsor Mafia. Down With The Crown!!
Yet you signed the dotted line swearing your allegiance,  ….
What nonsense.
Well said 👏👏👏 they serve no purpose whatsoever
He's not my king,he can ram his title,get rid of that inbred monarchy,we dont need them,Andrew is a filthy bstd who was best buddies with epstien,come on,get rid of the lot. I'm also a p"ssed off veteran,ashamed of this country and my service,I got rid of my medals,they mean fek all to me,atleast i earned them.
As an ex Australian Military veteran l totally agree.
I have always believed that the British royals are criminal scumbags
envieus slug

They gave you a job , wouldn't like to be in the trenches with this girl,100 % this guy is a sook not a soldier,were you the cook bro,
The numbers of homeless people in our country is appalling considering the fact that we cant even rehoused them and spending 100 millions pounds for a ceremony is just disgusting!
Well said you are man with integrity 👍🏽👍🏽🥝🥝🇳🇿🇳🇿

I think some wee man is just a hobby little bit jealous 🤫
Since 1992 the Royals have paid tax. Not a fan of the royals by a long chalk but it you say something It should be correct.
Personally i'd like for the monarchy to stay, for me they represent a level of class and mannerisms on how we should conduct ourselves. I agree they have more than enough money to look after themselves however.
Nurses.  Train drivers dont make any money ..... sex pistols working class .....  ( well done know i  going to buy your book that you shamlessly pluged )
Hats off to U Mr Speaker.. God bless 🙏 U
I disagree fully. Greatness comes at a price. Your freedom now was given by the very people you show such disloyalty too. Judging By the comments if you don't like it here then leave.
THANK YOU FOR TELLING THE TRUTH!!!!!!!!!!
Charles Christmas message about the poverty, cost of living etc. just one of Camilla’s gowns would feed several families for months. Throw in some of Catherine’s too and the entire street would be able to eat. It’s just not fair.
The only royal I had respect and admiration for was the queen mother, and of course princess diana,
You are spot on they have to go just like this piss poor government especially Charles he’s a joke it’s all about him and what about is paedophile brother really.??????👎🏻
We have to forget and except all there bullshit over hundreds of years to still be doing the same old same old and clowns still take there to the knee for those criminal's responsible for all sorts of crime and still there called royals WAFJ
Yes totally agree put we have many brain washed people in our country still thing that royals are nice people dig deeper look there only interested in themselves they live in mansions mostly empty paid for by the people while normal citizens outside there door go homeless and hungry these royals  would step on top of them  so much for kindness and charity open there doors not a chance except for the elite classes 😪
The royals are dead we dont need these vile people ruling over us in 2024 the country is drowning while they live there lavish life styles sad apologises for the uk disgusting disgrace to all of us
Well the fact is that the REAL royal bloodline to England, lives in Australia.. And its proven..  Search for it in here and you will see. Its a documentary with Tony Robinson, who tracks down the real bloodline to the thrown of England
He is Bang on.
Get rid
Love your real take on things, so I subbed,
The ruling class in both France and the USA are also very corrupt! To be honest in today's world there is no real democracy anywhere, it's an illusion!
I have good reason to be critical; and I can agree with you to an extent when it comes to Charles. He was, in my opinion, a weak and spiteful child - and as far as I am able to discern, has 'grown' into a weak and spiteful man. I am given to understand that he even delegates a considerable quantity of his day to day work as a public servant. However, the same cannot be said of Her Late Majesty, who was arguably the most diligent Monarch this country has seen since Elizabeth 1st. Listening to you, sir; all I hear is a bitter little man with a bad attitude! I doubt that you could last a month were you to attempt to do the job our late Queen did; every day, without a break, wherever she was, for 70 years! So before you bend your, in my opinion, vile, twisted tongue around further insult; take time to think. Perhaps even carry out appropriate research
Welfare for people who are already billionaires many, many times over is something the ppl of England should reconsider, especially one as self serving and arrogant as Charles.
Are You reading my mind
Strange someone who hates the monarchy still wants to live here very odd
Not my king. Let's have a republic.
William will be the last King of the British monarchy. Their own family members are helping Expedia their downfall. Meineke's around the world do not have anything in common with the commoners.
Scamer of the high power puppets
No King but Christ.
Absolutely brilliant mate . Tremendously said.
I dont hate the royal family i dislike the royal family thats the difference  i dont understand while there needed in this day/age  21st century Britain  NO  .time to go The king/Queens are past there sellby date here now simple has that 😂
You shouldn't have taken the shilling then
Harry doing a job on his father looks good on shady king Charles until he removes them Harry and magpie from working Royle s under his crown until then their Woking Royles daubling in politics shady king
Feel for ex serviceman going through all that just so a very few can gain hope they are wanting on other side for weasels like Blair mountbatten and all rest of clowns that send young men to there demise not a spine between them just hide behind there wealth
Not my king
Yea cos in France there’s no poverty ……  how stupid . Honestly what useless shallow thinking .
Absolutely FU#KING SPOT ON. Thank you for speaking the truth, these people ( the royals ) are CRIMINALS FFS. Nothing more/ nothing less. But the BLIND SHEEP will CONTINUE TO FOLLOW🤦🏻‍♂️ soo sad
Charles best mate jimmy saville say no more about the royals, Edward and Epstein, time for the out dated system to go
My sentiments exactly!
Grimms fairytales in the 21st century.What a fkin joke.Only in England nowhere else.
Well Said..It is an Archaic waste of so much Money ,entitled by these inbred,  completely Disconnected from People and lives they look down upon...Sad To think They still exist!!!! Corrupt Deal makers.
Charles gets 200million annually, taxfree. Barf.
The royals bring in money my ar#e,theres empty palaces in France and many other countries where tourists go to by the millions, its the buildings they go to see not the LEECHES that lived there
Let us never forget why he was given another name of TAMPON CHARLIE.  The King 😅 of twats is an embaressment to our nation like no other, well i partially retract that he is biggest fool when you have brain dead Biden as President of the USA.
Myself being anti Royalist, totally, and wholeheartedly agree with that. "Come the Republic" and freedom for the people...!
Agree, it is the same in my country, the Netherlands..the royals are ruined them selfs because they support the WEF…just like Charles, never liked him, he married a innocent girl, made her his wife…but never loved her…using her for heirs, and now he ruined the life of his second son, because he isn’t now not important anymore, because William got his heir….and Harry married a women they don’t like..
2nd time ive watched this Royal Babylon a history of the crimes of the royal family an excellent watch!
What this republican cl'own won't tell you is that all of the ex-British colonies, now republics, are sheet wholes... including the US. If you dump the king, you will replace him with a banker pretending to be a president. NOTHING will change.
He lost his right when married out of royalty tbh the queen mother said that if married then had to give up the right to the crown his sons are the same so tbh the only ones who are allegeable are the kids none of the adults tbh so it’s a joke… It’s over for royals tbh tho feels with everything going on with government we could see the past becoming more like the past as we keep going down the road… 🤍♠️
I've said it for a long time that 20-30 years ago all the news footage of Charles at Cloisters every winter doing his skiing was a real cover up of his Davos meetings (now the WEF) hence his climate control brainwashing BS
Charles Andrew Edward All 3 brothers close friends with 3  different pedos  🤔 you would have thought our intelligence agencies would have known & warned them   Unless????
As a Veteran, disabled by service, and screwed out my true War Pension entitlement.  I say fuck the monarchy and the government who believe we are nothing but cannon fodder.  They all claim to look after Veterans, but in reality it's not like that.  Even Combat Stress has been infiltrated and they are actively supporting the MoD and Veterans Agency to screw Veterans suffering from conditions such as PTSD and Complex PTSD by labelling them with Personality Disorders.  Even arguing that for people who were not even diagnosed with the condition.  Then there is the question of why some end up in accidents for challenging the system!  Why some Rupert tells them to RTU when it makes no sense at the time, until stuck at a bottle neck and hit from the side at high speed.  Because if they didn't RTU, they couldn't be sure of the route and where to hit you.  End the Monarchy, the Globalist rule and say "NO TO WAR".
Tell it all. Matter of fact, Harry and Megan are working for their own money . People of England are brainwashed. They don't see how they're being treated, my royal
I have always found it revolting these Royals wearing high ranking uniforms, and especially medals they have never earned.  This is a gross insult to members of the armed forces that have actually earned them. Disgusting and nauseating. Just strutters.
Thank you🤗🤗🤗 It's the British monarchy yes and, it's all monarchies on our planet!!
Well said ? You touched on the pistols and they were a big influence at the start of my youth. I was a 12 yr old kid when Anarchy in the UK  entered into my life and that was something that I could identify with. It showed me maybe not realising it back then that there was something very far wrong with the path that this country was on . I'm in my 50s and the only thing that has changed in life since then is that it's only got worse. Honestly I think that this system needs a revolution. Anyways I enjoyed it💯 you have a happy Xmas man.✌️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
The Royals name is German. It's called Grobbertrotter. They changed to Windsor during the. 2nd world war afraid people would not want them.
British Monarchy  is  the equivalent of a cheap soap opera
Riyal family are descendants of colonial masters.  They owned slaves
Has KING CHARLES AND JOHN KERRY SPEECHES AT COP 28 BEEN SEEN IN GREAT BRITAIN ?? IT SHOULD BE FRIGHTENING FOR EVERYBODY !!! KING CHARLES SAID WE DONT OWN THE EARTH!!! HE WANTS 7 BILLION PEOPLE TO BE STARVED BY REMOVING FARMING  WILL ALLOW THOSE ELITES TO RULE OVER THE SLAVES LEFT ALIVE TO TAKE CARE OF HIS NEEDS!! NOBODY BELIEVES THAT CHARLES WILL NOT EAT WHAT HE WANTS AND BUGS FOR THE REST!!! CHARLES WILL LIVE HIS LIFE OF LUXURY !! WHILE DEPOPULATION BY STARVATION IS HIS PLAN !!  HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL BE SAYING GOD SAVE OUR KING WHEN THEY AND THIER FAMILIES STARVE TO DEATH ??? WAKE UP BRITS YOU ARE IN THE SAME BOAT AS AMERICA AS WE STARVE TOO. ????
🇬🇧👑🏴‍☠️
Brilliant educational content, keep up the good work 🤛🏿
Tim Cohen knows who he is (AC)! Yes, the bible is playing out before our very eyes!   Revelation 12 Sign September 23rd 2017 to September 23rd 2025 (Feast of Trumpets) 8 Years exactly. Manchild is born! Rapture??? I think so!  KC owns over 1/4 worlds lands (crown land) with trillions at his disposal. Wake up people, the antichrist is here, but many will overlook this or dismiss altogether!  Love you brothers and sisters!
The British Royal family has been finished since the death of the Queen Elizabeth ii
Hey guys you may not know this but midway through this video an advert for an organisation called Zaka featuring the Israeli president calling Palestinians animals popped, absolutely disgusting
Absolutely correct Joe, these clowns have a big box of dress up costumes and go around awarding each other trinkets and titles while their serfs continue to struggle
They are reptilian
This time every year we watched the old hag sit in a room layered in gold, had a gold desk with a gold piano in the background, trying to convince us that she is one with the people of England
John lydon was married to a multi millionaire in 1978….!
The man’s right.
There's only one king I respect and that's King Leonidas of Sparta. Do you think Charles could summon 300 hundred soldiers who were prepared to stand by his side and fight to the death against impossible odds after being betrayed and out flanked- I don't. Great video.
What about the ROTHSCHILD that control them?
A total pillock. Just as well that the British Army didn't worry about how low your IQ was. You moan about the money spent on the Royal Family, which is a pittance taken against the Country's GDP (look it up if you don't know what GDP is). I bet you and others with the same mindset happily watch Premier League football where a large proportion of the players earn £100k plus a week and see no problem with this.
Well said, They're a family of tax & law dodging vermin.
How ironic for a former employee of the King, to be sitting infront of the union flag 😂 that was created by who? What a disgrace to the country.
it's obvious that the the oath you took means nothing to you.
If you die and dont leave a will, everything you own goes to the king or prince William tax free, depends on were you live in UK.
The Royal Grifters & buffoons
finally someone who isnt scared . lost friends over speaking the truth haha . idiots

I detest the "Royals"
WELL SAID. SIR.  ✨️ THEY DONT CARE ABOUT US AT ALL . PEOPLE STARVING IN BRITAIN AND THEY ARE WORKING.  CAN'T AFFORD   RENTS. COULD END UP IN THE STREET WHERE ARE THIS MONARCH WHEN PEOPLE BRITISH PEOPLE NEED HELP.  BRITISH  PEOPLE PAID ALL THERE TAXES AND ALL DUTIES PAID. AND GOT NOTHING.

false idols robbers people cheer them and wave their flags they can't see their being fleeced by the firm can we ever get the truth
Am I right in thinking his inheritance was tax free ?
The politicians are exactly the same and I fear , even though the majority do not know , we are still peasants 🤦‍♂️
The serious character flaws and poor judgment of Charles Windsor, the recently-ascended British monarch, would in any fair and objective consideration have disqualified him from appointment to any public office, let alone that of Head of State. However the more important question to be asked is not about the acceptability of this or that individual, but about the monarchical system itself. Monarchy, in Britain and elsewhere in the modern world where it persists, is an anachronistic and by its very nature profoundly antidemocratic institution. Whether in its absolutist or constitutional form it is the ultimate glorification of privilege and inequality and functions as an ideological legitimation for other political, cultural and economic structures that also perpetrate and perpetuate these vices. Sadly, much of the population remains in thrall to monarchy's irrationality, conceits and deceits, as they do to those of the complementary and mutually reinforcing institution of religion (whose pre-eminent voice in England continues to be the established Church of England).  Harry Windsor and Meghan Markle's recent distancing of themselves from the status quo, though limited and clearly motivated by negative personal experience, is to their credit so far as it goes (not *_very_* far). But it will be a great deal more to their credit if they should ever find the clarity of vision to see beyond their own tedious individual circumstances and the strength of conviction to break completely with the monarchy and actively work for its dissolution. And the same goes for all of us.
You should be ashamed of yourself  Did you get kicked out of forces  Only person unhinged is you  Charles is a great king  Maybe you should look up what charles has done for our country also helping children  before you say King Charles has done nothing with his life  God Save Our King
Well done for telling the truth ! 👏
American here. I can tell you after 200+ years of supposed free and fair elections. It all turns out the same. Eventually the autocrats the technocrats, elite takeover and give you the illusion of freedom even here we’re not free. We’re here at the whim of the elite, so I wish you luck, England, you’ll need it.
Thank u for serving...respect for all military, army
Human hybrids lizard people
We need a Republic
Charles turned his back on Palestine too.  Didnt vote a cease fire in the U.N.  Didn't vote at all.    Think he cares. ?
Joe am glad someone who worked in the army and knows what hes really like am glad you got the balls to say it how it is and what he's really like. I really dont none of them they are all full shxt he dont care about his people just his best mate  at the time he was alive Jimmy Savile and we all know what he did says a lot to me about the king. Fxck the king and all what he stands for the low life rat.
There's very dark forces at work, and the royal family arnt immune from their power, bilderburg , forget them there's skull n bone,  the illuminati,  there's forces that control the world and its citizens,  we are toys to be played with! End of nothing more!
So much wickedness in this world, Only when CHRIST Returns to earth will all this evil be rectified/remedied . GET READY FOR THE RAPTURE And THE Return OF THE REAL KING = KING JESUS / YESHUAH MESSIAH
They are "imposters" their real family name is "Rothchild" not Windsor!! They are scum of the Earth and people with throw up when they realise what other things these sicko's get up to!!
Can you tell what it is yet? Well owz about that then 😂
Your not a royalist then? They take what they can from society that's what they do?
Wow I never new brits felt this way. Remember what these monarchs did to the world, and continue to do especially South Africa. So never been a fan of your kings and queens except Lady Diana. 🙂
He's a socialist.
And then there is Jimmy Savile and royal friendships.  Really great vid.  Thank you. Well presented.
It's time to retire the Monachy and all royalty around the globe, I'm not in agreeance with Socialism though I am a believer in capitalism.
Agreed
"The Great Awakening"
The whole system of Monarchy and the Lords etc, is an anathema to most  good people who struggle to make a living! Also the system of Government has outlived its usefulness where they are all now the same party with different tie colours! Not only that but they serve the wrong masters!  The WEF in stead of the PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY!  KC3 broke his solemn vow to his masters -- the PEOPLE of the UK by still supporting the WEF & Speaking at its conference!
I don't know when you last heard about what's been taught in our schools nowadays but it ain't anything about Cromwell or Henry 8th etc, my wife has just retired due to the fact that she is one of many who was told to teach about the "The quran and its teachings!" How is this British?  Its not but the teachers aren't allowed to be upsetting others by teaching them British history!!!. This country has gone to shit and I don't ever see it becoming any better!!!

Give the British a cup of tea and a cigarette and life is great.
Typical leftist who is jealous of someone else’s wealth.

Where are the artists? Queuing up for their OBEs. In other words, they've been bought. Y'all need to do what we Americans did almost 250 yrs ago. Of course, we're in the toilet now with Amoeba Brain Biden but I'm praying that will change in 2024.

With you all the way, Joe.  Swore my oath of allegiance to Elizabeth the second, and her off spring.  I did not mean a word of that oath.  I think of them as the scum of the earth.
Elizabeth Tudor started the British Empire. Queen Victoria made it great. The late Queen Elizabeth II managed to hold onto it when it should have been lost; the late Queen being the last of the great Monarchs. Not sure what comes after that.  Yet somehow, the Monarchy continues to be the symbolic disparity between wealth and poverty. As powerful as the Monarchy continues to be, it's an enigma how such power is incapable of resolving this everlasting discrepancy.
They all need disbanding. They are no longer fit for purpose.
Don't forget the slave trade
What a Bitter Man, He needs to do something he can feel good about.

As a x Australian Soldier i am so ashamed i served under the Edwards Crown,, the bunch of inbreed Pedophiles
Love this
I don’t watch it waste of time all that money spending should give to people homeless food donations
there is no great Briton   the goverment  hasnt got a clue how to run this country   working class and OAPs are looked down upon  yes  we need to stop wasting money on our super rich  royals
🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋
King Charles is my hero. I have lived in Canada my whole life. I grew up with the King. My third great grandfather was a Captian in Upper Canada under Sir Allan McNabb at Dundurn Castle in Hamilton. We desperately need Heros to lift our society out of the hole we now live in.
Ahhh you were discharged from the armed forces, and not in the good way discharged, so what that tells me is your full of sour grapes,
My concern with King Charles 3 ,is ,he is for net zero which is to keep us cold ,poor and starve under the illusion the world is in peril and how close he is to the WEF. If you don't know them I strongly recommend you do quickly ,before it's too late !!!
Same drum beat different century
Well said.
No person should ever bow to another person. Unless it's a local greeting where both do it to each other.
They gave away Palestine, when it was not even theirs to give away...!!
if we dont have the monarchy we will have  elected politician,  we all know they are frugal and look after the best interest of the public, every penny spent for the good of the country.  who to choose, blair, corbin cameron, johnson.  biden,  trump.  they wont bleed the system will they?   monarchy gives us neutral representation in the worl.  they give us identity.  without them we are a faceless little island just there waiting to be swallowed up under americas domination.  no thanks.  monarchy isnt perfect but  i am not impressed with the life in american, accusations of vote rigging,   nor france,  strikes and more strikes.  no country  is perfect.  if it is because you hate rich people then what are politicians if not richer than most of us peasants?   an elected president with their whole family on a money grab?      the queen did pay tax.  it was expected after brexit there would be more money for NHS  where is it,  politicians responsible for squandering our money.  just my opinion.
England and Germany was meant to start the world wars together but Germany went  alone. The inheritance tax so they rob  us twice and get away with it.
Unit and take it BACK NOW❤🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Britain is no longer a rich country because its economic system is based on theft, looting and genocide. Stealing resources that England does not have and enslaving entire countries was the choice of the British. This helped finance for a standard of living that such a small country cannot achieve. Now that the countries victims of this looting, these genocides and this colonialism are strong enough to resist and that they can also obtain the protection of other great powers like Russia and China who offer them an alternative, the United Kindom is ruined. It should be noted that the British economic system was also adopted by the United States and for the same reasons the USA is bankrupt.
They are a bunch criminals and yes...the English people still cheer for this German blooded family...they are the illegal immigrants of the uk
I've never understood how you can have two forms of government which are clearly diametrically opposed; democracy and monarchy. How is democracy supposed to work in conjunction with monarch. Especially when the monarch outright OWNS the entire country? I once heard the PM of Canada take the oath of office. His oath consisted of nothing more than swearing fealty to the Queen. And he to recite the oath 3 times, and at no point in the oath were the people of Canada (another country owned by the English monarch), even mentioned! How can you people be "proud" of people who squander unbelievable sums on "pomp", while the people struggle daily to survive?  My German grandfather used to say the English were strange people. Didn't understand until I was much older. Good luck to you folks.   😎🇺🇸
LordMoutabbeten, we got rid of that pedophifole, here in Ireland.
The only reason Youtube doesnt ban your envious bottom is that you are playing into the hands of the Matrix.
the whole royal firm are parasitic evil and self serving. I had little respect for them anyway with their leeching off the country but when we have a royal nonce sued by his victim and the Queen gives that royal nonce 12 million to give to her to hush her up...... and they say nothing because lets face it Andy was just like his Uncle Mountbatten who just as a matter of interest as well as being a royal nonce himself, was a great friend of Jimmy So Vile and "brought him into the family firm" where he became a close friend of C harlie........and then its revealed Charlie boy is outed as takling two huge carrier bags worth of moneyfrom Bin laden's brother for cash for honours- a situation hushed up "by the establishment"  The real sickener is though, this piece of work handing over a third of the country in the form of the duchy of cornall to his equally odious son Willy , literally millions in money, putting his life long mistress on the throne beside him- whom he was with whilst Diana provided his "Heir and spare"..... a thrown and crown worth billions as little old ladies who have no money and cant afford to heat their houses or buy decent food, spend their last pennies to stand outside waving plastic union jacks made in china.......  you know what.... the french had the right idea in getting rid of their royal leeches... we should too and ship them off to florida and disneyland so they can be the star attraction.  Theres an old saying that the biggest con ever done on the British public was the upper classes and elite, convincing the middle classes that the poor were the problem and this utter piece of **** and his family and sysophants and hangers on are the physical manifestation of that saying, actively the pillar that props up our whole scum filled elitist system.   Viva la revolution.
In total agreement.  Especially since we found out Charles has been taken peoples I heritance who die intestate
How do we get rid of these vultures
Not my king never was never liked him as a prince not once have I fought for king and country was for the guy next to me not royalty  even if hough i come from a royal regiment no wonder why i left the british army to do pmc and later on to join fights against isis with pesh 70brigade sf  and hassiage  retiring just over a year ago country is a shambles full off ideological  imbicils CARNT wait to get home to philipines with my family and wife nothing here but taxes and misery a sad life run by puppets
The way they treated Princess Diana was appalling!  I have no time for the monarchy anymore.
When people advocate for the end of the Royal family, they get cheers from across the world, but when I advocate for the abolition of the Indian President, I get called into office because i'm 'trying to bring upon the end of democracy'
My Father said "Charles is a very unlucky Name".
For me the 3 best arguments for keeping the Royal Family, is that the Royals have fought for this country, like Andy in the Falklands and Harry in Afghanistan, and the Duke of Edinburgh and Princes Trust. Also we should have "not been lucky to be British" as a friend told me, when Henry VIII may have caused the trouble in Ireland, forming his own church, as well as Edward VII allegedly practising Hitler's walk.
He has his shoe laces ironed ffs !!
The only money they (royalty) bring in, is their own pockets
Class system it's real. Home school learn to write. The pen is mightier than the sword!
My problem with rule n Queen is how us Australians have been treated.  From Ned Kelly to Eureka Stockade, how Australian federal government steal my Pa rights to my rights today.  Take example we rule by Queen then Australian federal law n state law but when covid hit Australia we had right under Australian constitution whether we choose to get the jab but state governments mandate n federal government did nothing.  Where was the Queen on this constitution rule??  Yeah King n Australian, state government can ALL F off.
Agreed 👍
As an ex Service man from the UK, I would not fight or do anything for the UK or the royal family now, I was young and stupid, not anymore.
Down down with the mitre and the Crown! Oliver Cromwell.
People don't realise the Royal family own the sea bed and wind farms pay rent to them,sorry the British people pay through their bills.The Queen mother "the nations other granny "  had the top tax avoidance experts, that's why she paid no death duties and had a massive overdraft with Coutts, how, the "Family" loaded her credit cards with their spending and Coutts allowed this . That's why people couldn't understand her massive debt.
Charlie boy is far more devious than people may think... most knew what was coming down the line, he's the type that won't take no for an answer... the end of the line for royals is closer than ever thanks to him. Quicker the better.
Wow, really powerful message and correct in every way. I have had exactly the same views for many, many years. Great video, thank you.
itotaly agree with you
Totally agree.
So sad. Such bitterness. Make your own life and stop whinging and making other people responsible forvyour failures
Great video. One of tne things I hate most about our soldiers is the blind loyalty the majority had to the Queen. The Queen was an even bigger scumbag than Charles.
Am an x squaddie I agree bud
They're all pedo's
That's fine if you feel that way, just don't think by not having a monarchy it is going to improve ordinary people's lives noticably or make the UK a much better place to live. It just wouldn't and you're deluded if you think otherwise
I couldnt say her/his majesty asit would stick in my throat.Charlie is thick pampered vain chump who had to be spoon fed to get him through military training
My ship was based in Malta in the late fifties and the royal yacht was present in Grand Harbour most of the time with almost daily roudy parties held and we often heard from members of their ships company about the shinnanakins that went on involving ALL THE ROYALS.
I totally agree 110%!
I can't believe they didn't use the opportunity of the Queen's passing to get rid of the Monarchy. They are a bunch of leeches. The West End brings in far more money than those mannequins.
Can’t stand Chick there useless. Not my king.
A peoples King would be King John th third ?
I could not have put it better myself,total totalitarian wasters.
My thoughts entirely
Charles is a selfish adulterator who married a cheap tart….that’s who sitting on the throne? Poor England,,,gone to the dogs!
Sound like a very bitter twisted man. Dont think he could be happy in any country
Queen in the innuendo album had a great song describing this situation. Before 1066 England had good line in Royalty, after that they have been a bunch of Barstuwards out for themselves.
Make me sick how utterly brainwashed the British people are by this so-called family. People booking time off work and paying for petrol or train tickets and having to stand in a queue for 15 hours to get a little glimpse of the queen in her coffin utter madness and she wasn't even in it. This constitution has done absolutely nothing for the British public apart from legally taking money out of everybody's bank accounts and put into there's so that they can carry on living the way they do and having their backside wiped by slaves with gold leaf toilet paper, absolutely crazy. I'm not going to feed into this crap and I'm bringing my family up to know the same.
Couldn’t of said it better myself
I'm English not British
Think about how us, Canadians feel about having a royal representative that takes a salary and it’s useless to our nation.
Cromwell died , then they bought back Charles 2nd .Why ? Because the "people" wanted a king .So it was a waste of time . Im no royalist , but a realist who looks at history .And what you said about it made no sense .Totally irrelevant .It failed through lack of leadership.
Yes, watch out for Royalty. These individuals are, in fact, green monster lizards. They eat human babies.
He’s a nonce same as Andrew. A disgrace
Not my king.
so true its called selling your soul for all time
Not to worry, your country is being overtaken by islamists and the "monarchy" will either resist and be removed or they will bend the knee to them.  Either way you're screwed.
They disgust me   they are gangsters 💯
Lord mountbatten always enjoyed a 12 year old, and I don't mean whiskey
The monarchy are over and done with. This will become apparent to all, in the not to distant future...
The meaning "soldier" is the sacrifice to the sun.... "sol" ... sun .... "dier" .... the one who dies.... and on the way... plunder the resources....  the public are given "entertainment" to be unaware of the real agenda.
Very well spoken. Truth spoken  will set one free. Unfortunately the royalists love tradition and love to bend their knees and beg for governance. It is these who, with their misplaced kudos allow these ultra aristocratic criminal fraternity their power. High time for a republic. 👍👊💪
I am not a Royalist, but find Charles the least repulsive of kings. And his mother was a decent woman. Much of this sounds like envy. Moreover, are Presidents and P M's any better. As for "the People", no use idealizing the Ruck!
As a Irish man I taught I would never hear those words from a English bloke so there's someone across the Irish Sea who can really see the lite, good for you mate.
History is a gaslighting lie. They teach children what lies they want to fill them up with. Not my king. Republic.  Have a good night
What’s your beef ?  Every person on earth has some sort of privilege or the other. True some have more than others but whoever said that all humans must live on the same line of privilege or that all humans have the same of anything.   The value of diversity is universal.  If you want to live like a king get off your fat a … and work or create something that stands for something unique in our world instead of making these hate filled moronic videos.   Talking of the horrors of their past. That is part of history.  Just like someone from your family line will look back at you some day in the future and say geez what a loser he used to make these hating videos.   All of us have a place in our world and it is up to us to make it work not by pulling others down but raising our own understanding and performance to get what we may want.
Anne should be sitting on the Throne ❤
you are so right  .
I like the Irish version of his name! Chuck the turd…
If I can ask ? Is Britain a bad place to live at ?
They stole it from us in the first instance and now use the political halfwits to keep it going !
My wake-up call was when i heard Charles had Jimmy Savile giving him and Diana marriage advice.  That combined with W.E.F and davos was enough for me .
💞💞👍👍🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺
It warms my heart that people of Britain slowly wake up to reality of Charles and his role in global agenda. These people not only use our resource but use them against our will and needs. And strongly believe it's last Monarch in UK as he will bring so much sorrow on this planet that will make famous Adolf look like my child's Schoolteacher comparing to Mr Windsor...
Great stuff. I know all this, but we need to be reminded. What a bunch of parasites.
I'm not too concerned about the rights and privileges. The Monarch swears a solemn oath to protect the sovereignty of the individual and the nation which is enshrined in our consultation. When the monarchy house fails to do this, the nation slides.
And the Crown Estate owns the whole coastline of the UK.  No wonder Charles is advocating wind farms.  They are getting richer and richer.
You sir, have balls of steal, and I hope, good friends and finances...
NOW YOU NO WHY MOST OF US SCOUSERS HATE THIS MONARCHY, HATE THIS GOVERNMENT 👽👽👽💩👽👍👍🏾👍
In your new U.K. would your democratically elected leader be an English Tory? As both a Scot and an Ex Sapper I’d be generally interested to know your answer.
Well said sir,that's just the stuff we know about many missing kids aswell
Good one you, what is the King doing about about the wars and genocide?
And you've only SCRATCHED the SURFACE of what they are involved in. If the average Joe knew....The FRENCH WAY would be DEMANDED!
Your real king lives happely in Australia
As a veteran myself  I agree with you , civil  liberty is none existence, I also believe service brings the right to vote and  to hold public office that would remove most if all current politicians there more to say like you I know I would be in trouble
Respect bro.
How can you be deferential to anyone because of an accident of birth?
Well said.
Moron. Just share the wealth and it will cure poverty. Education cures ignorance but there is no cure for stupid.
His duty free coming home from arabia was £1,000,000 in a carrier bag and this happened several time. A gift from an arab countrpart. You have to hand it to charlie for his nerve , few people would have the nerve to wear medals with no attribution and less entitlement. Entitlement, yes thats something the royals have nailed down.When life us just one big party with ordinary working classes footing the bill one would feel entitled, and he a crown as well. I bet he wears it at home too.    Bye!
you sound like communists , are you?
I agree with you but look at the presidents of France and America. Even bigger money grabbing deceitful nasty idiots than any royal.
That generation are called conspiracy theorists now fella. We are still a thorn in their lizard sides
Welcome to Britain's financial slavery while the king is a bunch of poor hating bastards who killed princess diana because she realised what monsters they really have !
Never liked them all baby eating lizards 🦎
My only concern is with what you said. What if we were stupid enough to elect a Khan or a Corbyn even worse an out-and-out Muslim who brought in Sharia law. What then another revolution?
Omg really ? Though I must say when kste was pregnant William said there's too many people in the world and I wasn't impressed
Ask yourselves. Where do our taxes go ?
Plenty of muppets around the world still like to spend their cash on these unroyals so for now the income from the dancing monkies far outweighs their upkeep
You did not mince your words. Good for you. I work in academia and ashamed of "colleagues" who do not have 1/10 of your critical thinking and intellectual honesty. The monarchy deserves all the destructive criticism we are capable of.
This man Charles is a joke period no respect for him or his entire family. Colonizers and squatters. Princess Diana is the true royal she is the true elegance and the aristocratic linage. She won’t colonize ppl but will help ppl. I love you Diana my heart broke when they killed you and yes the royal family killed her for Sure!
Everything you say is 100% true. If you add up how much they cost then take the increase in the visitor £, we would be ahead by billions. For what it cost to officially put those stolen gems on old big ears bonce, it should have been put towards the NHS at least it has a function and benefits we, the people. As for his floosy being dragged around beside him, why ? She isn’t the Queen and she never will be, that was agreed on when big ears and the Rottweiler naffed off to the registry office, is a Morganatic marriage, just because you bump off your first wife it doesn’t mean that she never existed, so it’s a big fat raspberry to the slag.
Long may no one reign over us!
I could never understand the slavish admiration for these parasites.
It's much worse than that, King Charles was the first person to kick off 'The Great Reset'.  This essentially is just a great wealth transfer to the 'Stakeholders'.  Check out Charles's connections with the WEF & Klaus Schwab.
Our dark (don't say Judeo - Masonic ) Overlords took over the bank of England when Cromwell came to power... which certainly doesn't make him any kind of revolutionary hero...   Ten aboriginal Kamloops BC kids were last seen in the company of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip who were convicted of child kidnapping by the ITCCS (International Tribunal into Crimes of Church & State),   Paul Kidd, the Queen's butler, operated a child-sex ring inside Buckingham Palace...  Prince Charles was a close personal friend of the most notorious  pedophile in British history, Sir Jimmy Saville ... and on and on it goes...   The narrative your presenting is nowhere near as dark as the reality... Lady Di said it best... THEY'RE NOT HUMAN!!!  xxx  Countdown to deletion by YouTube Thought Police... Agents of our Dark (don't say Judeo-Masonic) Overlords, 3, 2, 1...
Jimmy Savile was King fatfingers best bud, says it all.
There living whit a twisted mindset!  Its a sicknes .   Dellusionel mindset
All royalty!  All sick gangsters
1000% I'm so glad you are speaking this because these people bear terrible fruit. They have Charles, who is a disgusting adulterer. He ruined Diana's life by using her to produce heirs in order to please mummy while having his abomination on the side. Her other son is a sexual pervert who lives with his ex wife who tried to put a hit out on him. They are constantly pimping out the "image" of Catherine and William to distract from a failure of a family because they certainly can't use anyone else to be the face of this disaster. Not to mention their atrocious history of persecuting and killing Christians. Why would anyone "follow" and idolize this monstrosity?
Ooops, I hadn't realised he'd been crowned, must've  missed it somehow.
Yes.........yes............yes ......and ...........yes I agree.   Thank You for saying what I think.  : )
Oh god are you ok make
Whatever at least you’ve got the freedom to say it
Thats strange! He didn't even mention how they are all pedophiles and they honor pedophiles by befriending them and  knighting them, and having them as prime ministers.
What pisses me off are all the awards they dish out as if they were passing round a bag of sweets

A very honest top man.wake up people.everyone born equal.time to get rid of the parasite monarchy.join the Republic now everyone.time for a change people.
There is the problem,British,the empire continues as mayors and crap like that,you know peeps in fancy dress that think they own us,problem is for far too long we are ruled by undercover Jews and look up semetic,its about hebrew or arabic language and they are anti semetic to arab speakers
Did the Queen defend her loyal elderly soldier from the kangaroo court in Ireland despite his suffering from terminal cancer?  No!  Did the Queen look after her loyal soldiers who had fallen on hard times?  She could afford it but didn't bother!  Did the Queen make her son in law and others carry out their duties to ensure that her forces' families lived in decent marrie quarters?  No she didn't!  Did she ensure that depraved individuals like Savile, Epstein and Maxwell were kept well away from "The Firm".  No she didn't - why not?
I never held it agenst a well traveled man but he went to .😂
Amen. What a waste this whole kingship BS is
His family stole the crown long time ago they are Germans
I think going all out for a coronation is fine.  Its  everything else he/they do.
Agreed 💯 There should be no "elite" . I am not an advocate for the bolshie alternative who also have the self indulgent puppet masters. People must grow up and take responsibility, keep an eye on anyone who starts grabbing power. Freedom above entertainment, money and fantasy
Charles doing P Company? I dont think so
As an Australian, l have nil interest in this family full of murderers.
MI5's watch list is so massive now, they can't follow them all.  These opinions are spreading fast. God bless the internet.
This was brilliant!  A true account of that Royal Family!  Especially that murderer Charles, who had Diana murdered!
The monarchy died the day Britain lost their queen
Thank You Joe. ABSOLUTE LEGEND. Thank you for your authenticity and integrity in presenting this information in the way you did. A true gentleman. And a King! For we each have a King or Queen / Sovereign living within us, as an archetype. Thank you for leading us home to our own autonomy and sovereignty. And thank you DDN
In Australia be a Republic
I couldn't agree more - accepting the royal family is the zenith of accepting inequality because you're basically saying that in your world view it's OKAY for some people to have more than you for no other reason than the fact they were born with the Windsor surname.
well said
Brilliant trueful video...
The Royals serve no good purpose.  They take, take , take and give nothing in return.  The fact they still exist is a reflection of a sick society.
WELL SAID BROTHER.............
Another middle class clown .saying how bad it is for government workers .if he mentioned poor working class I would have took more notice of what he said . He just sounds bitter . How will getting rid of the royals benefit the poor .
Best explanation I have heard about MonAckey down with the greedy and selfish.
The real royal family live in Australia. Sir Tony Robertson documentary.
My old grandad an old ww2 vet thought they were a bunch of grumbles ,that have kept the British and Irish people at each other’s throats and hating each for centuries to bolster their land grabbing and money grubbing ways ,we as people would of got along just fine without their interference and divisive bullshit no more of it .four nations as one❤🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇮🇪🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿♥️
Y3ah, and now you have Charles as head of the WEF.  Disgusting!
The clown formally known as prince
Whilst I have absolutely no time at all for Charlie boy, and certainly don't recognise him as my King (he's a complete tool !), I feel that your ire would be better aimed at the people who make us poorer by the day - not the Royal Family, but our own Government !
VOTE ME, I WILL MAKE THIS ISLAND GREAT AGAIN, YES MORE BLOODSHED THAN ALL THE WARS FOUGHT. BUT THIS ISLAND WOULD RULE THIS WORLD.🤫
What a load of crap from a traitor!
Once the monarchies stopped being answerable to God 1st in their statements and behaviors, they had become like salt which had lost its savor,good for nothing shouldbe thrownout.  The "people "godless as they are, will be no better.
I agree with you 100%  -    I used to be pro-monarchist  -  I see our new 'King' as nothing more than a parasite. The changes to which we are being subject right now are due to  the growth of Bitcoin and other DE-CENTRALISED digital currencies over which the bankers and their cabal will have no control  -    Decentralised Digital Currencies represent Freedom for the whole human race including us   -  They are presently in Panic mode because their power and wealth comes from the fact that they can print money for nothing.  They are to attempt to bring in CENTRALISED digital currencies over which they will have total control and which will enable them to continue living off our backs.  Unfortunately King Big Ears is not only part of this movement -  but I suspect is actually one of the leaders of this movement.
He is completely out of touch with reality and seems unable to see that without the protection that absolute power bestows, he is highly vulnerable to the consequences of unpopularity, especially when the rank and file of his kingdom are becoming poorer and angrier every day. That didnt go too well for Charles the First. Maybe he reckons he can always just run away if necessary. Not too much going on between the ears, at any rate.
He allowed his own military force to be tricked and forced into having the covid vax, the unvaxxed military were kicked out....! The WEF will not employ pilots who have had the vax, that tells you something.
Funny how when the Queen died the WEF sped up there evil plans, not surprising with our 'King' at the helm. Disgusting....
Charles told Camilla he wished he was her tampon. He had to settle for being a douchebag.
The concept of leadership through bloodlines is primitive and insane. Imagine if DJT pulls off his coup and then his clearly unintelligent children replace him. I think anyone should be able to apply to be Head of State, then take a battery of tests and interviews, the results then fed to AI to pick the person actually most qualified to lead.
"Family of in-bred Morons"......almost split my Champagne
As a British citizen, this person is spot on.
Keeping the monarchy wasting taxpayer money.
The one that annoyed me was Edward 8 who gave the Germans information about our troop movements during World War II with the idea they would win and put  him back on the throne.  How much damage did he do?
🥾👂👂
100% agree
You mean the Establishment and then the ROYALS, you’re right we need the people’s REVOLUTION
Here in South Africa, they took everything from us. I am from the Zulu tribe, they killed our kings and took our land.
great video..
Love this guys videos as well! He’s so handsome
I think he hates the Monarchy.   I'm I smart to notice this ??
Lost all respect for royals after the way they reacted or rather didn’t react after Diana died . Public outcry made them lower flag on palace to half mast . Disturbing attitude ! Charles totally disrespected his mother by calling Camilla Queen . She was just his bit  on the side . Married to Diana yet seeing Camilla behind her back ???? Needs to go to Specsavers !
But if there was No Royal Family, who are all you Military Heroes going to die for in yet another horrible War ???
Didn't you swear allegiance to the Crown when you enlisted?
I agree with all you say , you couldn't put it any better
Why give this man time of day
What man, when asked, does not know where he met the love of his life??? See the interview when he and Diana showed off her engagement ring, and he was asked,on camera, where they had met, and he had to make up an answer!!
You need to blame Thatcher who eroded the wealth of the working class in the U.K..
As Italian I completely agree with you. It is laughable to see the royals going to charities. Stinking hypocrisy. They don't even feel embarassed about the spreading poverty in the country.
Absolutely correct on every detail. Except, it doesn't go far enough. There's an awful lot more to come, when we are allowed to speak about it.
Spot on. It’s so clear,how do more not see it?
Thanks for this. It's stupid to have a king at this time and age.
Nice hehe military cos play
As an ex Serviceman I was always confused why my oath of allegiance was to the Windsor family and not to the elected representatives and laws of the country. I was also confused how minimal actual service, always in safe areas, could in such a short time earn such high ranks and a chest full of medals. Now we have to endure "Admiral" Annie who never served a day in her life. We have Eddie the fortnight Marine who all of a sudden is honoury Colonel of several regiments of real soldiers. Time to kick the whole scrounging clan into touch.
I get what your saying. He is the symbol of give your more to receive your less. People are just scared of change but their not..
Be awar agenda 21 is at work to get rid of soverirgn nation's and monarchy its being erroded in front of our eyes follow your own instincts
They want to get rid of us the threat because we are many they are few no one knows where their money comes from or goes you are right they are the Mafia peekyblindets macirrvellion privalaged fewtjey will and have got rid of population over and over again throughout history be warned
Well said Joe, God protect you
They are blood drinking pedophiles
Joe You are unfortunately mistaken with many of your facts. I am a republican but I am much more careful to get most of my facts right.
What a sad view. No one will pretend the monarchy is perfect, but this is just so one sided and cynical. As for levelling society - that does not happen under any system of government and you use France and America as examples - do you think their society is any better? Really? I'd rather have a constitutional monarchy than a presidency that can produce a Trump any day. Giving people the power doesn't always work - look how people voted like lemmings for Boris - that went well.......
100 million ? Thats the cost of crowning Charles ? DOES anyone think he,s worth it ? Only his direct minions and sycophants.. It sounds like a wicked king in a fairytale ,, his people starving and homeless and he has big party ,,  hum nm  Sounds like some karma needed ,,
💯👏👏👏
There is a great book , Conspirators Hierarchy by Dr John Coleman, that has so much info on the royal family and what they own and run. The book is very harsh on gay's, which i DO NOT agree with but if you can ignore that it has more info about how all things are run than pretty much any other book writen. I totally agree with the vid and think that they are about as royal as my arse.
He's just had a pay rise of 45% why very single one of them make me vomit
Someone just came to my door from the princes trust I said to him ,,I don't give money to sick satanic swamp rat families
Love it
At last some reality, generations have been blinded by worship and loyalty.
2 dozen republicans were prevented from protesting at his coronation, but it was ok for 333,000 pro palestinians. He supposed to be green but he flew his personal Bentley to France for a 3 day visit. They WON'T declare how much they spend on security, even though we pay it. They just take it.
Well said
Not my king ! Just a selfish leech
Agree. Can’t stand them
WELL SAID ,TOTALLY AGREE ❤
To be replaced with what, a DICTATOR, no thanks.
In the name of all my fellow German countrymen I apologize for having exported the House of Battenberg to Britain.......
No one should join the army! The rich use them as warmongering fodder! They don't care for the soldiers as is so evident when they come out of service and need assistance and help! None is available to those who have sacrificed themselves for proxy wars and greedy Elitists!
Charles was proclaimed “King of Israel” at his coronation - why is nobody talking about it?
I can’t believe that the monarchy still exists 2023 … people are so stupid
You have earned the RIGHT to speak Sir ....well said x ❤❤❤ And good friends with Jimmy Saville to boot  🥵😡😡😡😡
Hes a fully paid up member of the WEF. The most vile movement since the third Reich. You will own nothing and be happy. Hes a disgrace. He's not fit to be king .
Bro sounds like a statham with hair, Thanks for stating the obvious brother, if at the moment this video has found 774k views , it makes me think at what point and what trigger is it going to take for people to change their reality and become masters of their lives
Inbred Moran's..how right you are..
Time too defund the monarchy all the money given too them could help get Britain back on its feet .
What else have the Romans done for us?  I'm not saying King Charles is easy going but in all fairness, it was the police that handed out protest banners to anyone that wanted to protest against him.  They were photographed and filmed doing it.  As for King Charles the first. He was innocent. He was no traitor.  He was not informed by his parliament concerning the needs of the people. He died a martyr to the cause. "The English Civil Wars comprised three wars, which were fought between Charles I and Parliament between 1642 and 1651. The wars were part of a wider conflict involving Wales, Scotland and Ireland, known as the Wars of the Three Kingdoms." Here is an extract, "In 1645, Parliament reaffirmed its determination to fight the war to a finish. It passed the Self-denying Ordinance, by which all members of either House of Parliament laid down their commands and re-organized its main forces into the New Model Army, under the command of Sir Thomas Fairfax, with Cromwell as his second-in-command and Lieutenant-General of Horse. In two decisive engagements – the Battle of Naseby on 14 June and the Battle of Langport on 10 July – the Parliamentarians effectively destroyed Charles's armies.   In the remains of his English realm, Charles tried to recover a stable base of support by consolidating the Midlands. He began to form an axis between Oxford and Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire. These towns had become fortresses and showed more reliable loyalty to him than others. He took Leicester, which lies between them, but found his resources exhausted. Having little opportunity to replenish them, in May 1646 he sought shelter with a Presbyterian Scottish army at Southwell in Nottinghamshire. Charles was eventually handed over to the English Parliament by the Scots and imprisoned. This marked the end of the First English Civil War. However, skipping a bit!!!...  In the North of England, Major-General John Lambert fought a successful campaign against several Royalist uprisings, the largest being that of Sir Marmaduke Langdale in Cumberland. Thanks to Lambert's successes, the Scottish commander, the Duke of Hamilton, had to take a western route through Carlisle in his pro-Royalist Scottish invasion of England.The Parliamentarians under Cromwell engaged the Scots at the Battle of Preston (17–19 August). The battle took place largely at Walton-le-Dale near Preston, Lancashire, and resulted in a victory for Cromwell's troops over the Royalists and Scots commanded by Hamilton.This victory marked the end of the Second English Civil War. Third English Civil War (1649–1651) well that was nothing to do with King Charles the 1st. He was no longer about. They murdered him after an unfair trial, that in my opion he shouldnt have bothered attending as he was King after all.  Nonetheless, we move on...  Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. Ireland had undergone continual war since the rebellion of 1641, with most of the island controlled by the Irish Confederates. Increasingly threatened by the armies of the English Parliament after Charles I's arrest in 1648, the Confederates signed a treaty of alliance with the English Royalists. The joint Royalist and Confederate forces under the Duke of Ormonde tried to eliminate the Parliamentary army holding Dublin by laying siege, but their opponents routed them at the Battle of Rathmines (2 August 1649). As the former Member of Parliament Admiral Robert Blake blockaded Prince Rupert's fleet in Kinsale, Cromwell could land at Dublin on 15 August 1649 with an army to quell the Royalist alliance.  Cromwell's suppression of the Royalists in Ireland in 1649 is still remembered by many Irish people. After the Siege of Drogheda, the massacre of nearly 3,500 people – around 2,700 Royalist soldiers and 700 others, including civilians, prisoners and Catholic priests (Cromwell claimed all had carried arms) – became one of the historical memories that has driven Irish-English and Catholic-Protestant strife during the last three centuries. The Parliamentarian conquest of Ireland ground on for another four years until 1653, when the last Irish Confederate and Royalist troops surrendered. In the wake of the conquest, the victors confiscated almost all Irish Catholic-owned land and distributed it to Parliament's creditors, to Parliamentary soldiers who served in Ireland, and to English who had settled there before the war.  But the truth is, the Irish Cromwell and his cronese beat were mainly elderly men women looking forward to their retirement.  At least King Charles III spoke up about UK architecture, when everything had turned into a concrete paradise. He spoke of a more classical period in his famous book that was missing here in UK. Now we see quaint little shops restored with intricate irion works carrying flower baskets. How ungrateful can you get. Harping on about things you know nothing about???    Creep!
Exactly send them to hard work jobs and limit pay and see how they survive instead they live on other people hard work people tax money , so true. Finally someone saying what millions think .. it’s XXI century end of bludgers. Take all castles money and everything . Make them start from zero like rest of people . 100% agree
So true.. brain washers of idiots
👏 👏👏👏 Viva la Revolucion
They only way to discription the Royal family is Parosites. They just take and take living of the Gravey Train. They only got to power by murdering those who apposed them previously.
Its a medieval system.  It wants consigning to history.  Where it belongs
Charlie bonce is an idiot along with air miles andy. The military get pissed off with them and their stupidity.
Parasites they have always been parasites, they are germs, wtf are they still there.absolutly horrible people.
Dude I stand with you I swore the same Oath .. it now stands with the people
Not worth watching. You’re not advocating the French model, probably the Russian one then. Anarchy instability and mayhem. And who’s the bright spark that replaces the monarch? Almost certainly someone stronger than any mere gangster, some dictator left or right with no regard for human life. Saved you the trouble of listening. Oh I forgot the accent…
Hear Hear.
I'm with you
And Rothschild controls this "king".
Parasites. Not my king .
Other European countries have royals but they are a lot cheaper to the tax payer and a lot more down to earth !
AM GLAD YOU HAVE SPOKE ABOUT CHARLES AND THE REST OF THEM THEY ARE LIVEING THE LIVE OF RILEY WHILE WE ALL STRUGGLE IN LIFE THEY ARE A F JOKE AND THE IDIOTS THAT SIT OUTSIDE ALL NIGHT WAITING TO SEE THEM ARE IDIOTS
The truth of it is, is that kings or queens are supposed to be Constitutional Monarch's who were supposed to be elected by a Democratic Wise Council historically known as a Witan. We the sovereign wo/men under our Sovereign Creator & Source of all natural things including Divine Wisdom,  temporarily lend our sovereignty to the Constitutional Monarch, Keeper & Defender of the Faith, Head of State - His/Her Majesty's Government, .. the most senior Public Servant, the Commander-in-chief of our military defence, the Keeper & Defender of our natural Common Law Constitutional principles, rights & freedoms, Keeper & Defender of the Peace, Harmony, Prosperity, Fairness & Justice of our nation, the most senior Diplomat & Ambassador for our Nation, .. Of course, men will be men, .. so we have a lawful safety measure built into our Common Law Constitution, the principles of this are stated in Article/Clause or Chapter, .. 61 of our original perpetual Constitutional MagnaCharta1215. Research a Daily Telegraph article, "Peers Petition Queen, .." which refers to a 2001 lawful invocation of this clause due to serious treasonous breaches of the UK & Commonwealths Constitutional Coronation Oath to God the Creator & we the people.
It’s great he hasn’t got a time machine, his sausage fingers could stop a juggernaut.
Brother,I'm born Birmingham, but the one I give my royals for us they get away wiv it on your face, but I still love ,y HARRY and MEGAN. I think Harry knows things we don't. That's Why he split from this family, think something about he's mums accident. Who's the villain in "Spare?"
The Royals don't pay tax but then neither should we because tax funds the murdering of children in Wars
I don't like the royals never have been
Clearly an intelligent, educated man (I don't know wether formally or self educated but it matters not) who is intelligent enough and free not to join the army so why did he ? Does anyone believe that if we had an elected head of state that we would all suddenly be better off ?If people are struggling to make ends meet,which of course they are,it is the politicians fault not the monarchs. The monarchy is not there to get involved in politics,that is the politicians job and it is our job to vote and whoever wins is his Majesty's Government.And if Britain isn't democratic and free enough for you ,you can always live somewhere else.
I have no interest in monarchy but I don't think we should get rid of them because any kind of replacement head of state won't be as good as what we have now. We have tried this before when Charles 1st was beheaded . Republic didn't work then don't think it would work now.
They murdered diana, mountbatten and countless others. They aren't human either, they are reptiles
Great show as usual and I love my country.  I like the monarchy but it’s unfair that we the tax payers have to fund them when they are loaded.  Enough is enough they don’t care about us.
Your a God dame disgrace a Communist
I can't stand Charles or his witch of a wife
I wonder how much the royal family are worth, the properties, jewels etc.,,,, I imagine if it were all sold up we could do a huge amount to improve the lives of working people....
Read 'The Antichrist and a cup of tea'. Very interesting.
Well said !!!
Selected by their handlers, The Rothschilds, the same family that have funded both sides of every war since napoleonic times.
Hes selling this country out
They are not the rightful heirs to the uk throne, The 14th Earl Michael Abney Hastings and his family are.
Charles favourite uncle was Mountbatten even though he knew he was a paedophile.
THE monakey are a load of free loaders in my OPINION. And KING CHARLES AND HIS QUEEN or NOT THE BRITISH PEOPLE'S THER OF GERMAN DESCENDENTS THAY KILLED ONE OF THE KINGS OF TO MAKE ROOM FOR THIS IMPORTER OF A MONAKEY THAT ARAGENATED FROM GERMANY!?ITS ALL ON FILM REEALS THER ANSESSTERS COSEING UP TO HITLER'S AND HIS REGEAM THE QUEEN AS A YOUNG GIRL WAS AMONG THOSE! WE'VE BEEN SLOWLY BEEN CHIPPED AWAY FROM WITHIN UNTIL IT STARTED SPREDING ACROSS THE BRITISH PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENTS AND EVENTUALLY THOUGH THE ENTIRE SISSTEM THAT'S SUPPOSED TO STOP THIS KIND OF CORRUPTION FROM GETTING INTO THE SISSTEM! INSTEAD ITS RULLING THE ENTIRE SISSTEM!.AS WE KNOW IT TO BE?.
Bring back the Anglo-Saxon Wittan, we elect a King, each generation, no passing titles on to heirs. Basically a national Lord Mayor, who has the power to over ride the excesses of parliament.
Your fellow republican
Is Charles thinking about hospital staff teacher's people do good everyday because mortgage. Mort gage.that latin for death grip. Working class don't know latin. See. It's big boys club with money. Did you ever hear pompus entitled. I hate new money as if crap one got in make sure that can't happen again. Wake up neighbors
I do not know anyone that supports the idea of or belief in the British Royalty, It is like an open wound in history seeping the vileness of the "Filthy Stinking Rich", like a butchers apron worn on the waist and dregs of ceremony, what a cretinous mob are we to find anything noble in the fetid stench of Royalty. (Australia 2023)
I totally agree with you and I am a ex Guardsman it’s time the monarchy along with the House of Lords was disbanded.
Family history dodgy Henrycut all his wives heads off started his ownchurch he was the head of it so he could divorce them
True Geordie has just had his David Icke video deleted. Although there's alien and lizard talk I think it's his Jimmy Saville the Royal family and their behind closed doors practices that got the video deleted. Who knew paedoooooos are comon place throughout the generations of theses people, its not the odd bad apple.
This guy is my kind of man . When I speak to people and say the same things about the monarch’s as this brilliant guy , they look at me as if I have two heads . I hate it when you get these silly , stupid, brainwashed older people saying , “ ah but they have been great servants to the commonwealth “ it absolutely does my head in . You cannot use a sentence with royalty and servant in it , these people are fed the best food in the world ,live in the grandest palace’s in the world , have so much money that they could not spend it all in about 10 life times but people still say “ ah but they have been great servants to the commonwealth “ drives me fucking crazy the people are so stupid .
Really enjoyed hearing this, keep it up, lots of Aussies agree with you.
How fucking dare they breathe the same air!!!
🤔🤗🍆🥔⚓️😉🤓😂
King Charles is guilty of treason. He openly gave a speech about the creation of a one world government and a one leader with a big budget of trillions of dollars. Sounds like treason to me, what do you think? I mean he's not loyal to the monarchy and it's people? Major problem is that the UK for which the monarchy is responsible for, is broke. Debt to GDP is over 140% last I looked. Brace yourselves for a collapse of the economy in the short term.
you are my hero Joe.
Good man, well said.
Never will be My King and Queen  the British people  some have short Memories,  never understood the lining up to pay respects to the Queen or any of them they are all for them self's, I think Cromwell had they right idea  I wonder what he knew
There is a place that stores all the past by gones of history that is the roots for outpr modern and progressive times. We should never forget our history and what came before us.  Today will be history in time and so on.  The monarchy is a piece of history that will be placed in storage when the people keeping it alive now is ready to let it go for the new creation of history for the tomorrows. It is inspiring, exciting, traditional, wealthy and is holding respect in position  for now for the UK. Northern Ireland and Scotland have already began their modern history for tomorrow but retaining all the colorful, fantastical, hard won reputations and histories that each has created of  its own history. It is difficult to do break always from tradition and oppression sometimes. All three countries have an individual history that should last forever in monuments, ideals, beliefs and traditions.
I was surprised that Charles made David Cameron a lord the day Suewela was fired , and then  instantly made Foreign minister. Charles is meddling  in politics against Brexit because he's  WEF.
This is an opinion.. the royal family is not responsible for the poverty the politicians are...as for the French they have their own problems..the royal family represents British culture..which a lots of people like.. luckily we are all aloud a view on this subject..so I'm going to disagree..
I salute you young man and thank you for speaking the truth 💖🙏💖 watching from New Zealand with respect
Amen Sir Amen
I agree we need to speak life ....2024 catch phrase season where Artist need to get like mr chips and say what they see .....charles is not and will never be my king .....
Very well put mate.
Theyre the bankers slappers aka the few who think inslavment is a good thing buyin up governments
Here we go, all coming out of the woodwork  I served my country as well... Those that do not like  our RF and Our Country buzz off
Yep
Get the book Our Martyrs, a record of Irish Catholic Priests, Bishops and Faithful laity, killed for their Faith - in Ireland under the Penal Laws 1535-1691.  Those murders and terrorism continued on through the following centuries, in various forms, up until 1922. All under the English Monarchy. The Primate of all Ireland, St. Oliver Plunkett was, amongst many English and Irish men and women hung, drawn and quartered at Tyburn in London. Evil ran in the blood of those kings and queens. Is Charles still a member of the population reduction WEF OWO, ?
This king is the worth of the monarchy
Thank you for your bravery and your truth Joe.
I love this description of our inept unfair ruthless greedy tax dodging Royal family our real MAFIA!
and now he gives his royal assent to all the bills, new laws that will make us suffer even more like the energy bill and the online safety bill  No more Rf
Royal family get financial advice directly from the self confessed Lucifériens, the rothchilds. Great video thankyou.
Yep, the RF are part and parcel of the global elites that are used to propagandize the masses on the Agenda. They have a responsibility to push the NWO propaganda. Loads of brits are still sucked into the pomp and circumstances of the monarchy. Likewise, lots of US are sucked into the two party Hegelian deception: R vs D. Thank you for your voice and courage!
100 million to put crown on his head is cheap hahaha  How much money is gonne in Ukraine to support nazis in Ukraine ?.billions how much money is going to israel ? Billions ... What about Council tax ? Biggest crap of last 100 years lol  Insurance companies omg lol  Once i was talking with friend he is traffic PC and he was twlling me how he stopped driver without insurance hahah and he told him how can you drive a car without insurance what if you kill someone!  I could not stop laughing i told him who give a fck about insurance when you kill a person would insurance bring dead man back to life ?  People are so.dumb and funny part in all this nonsense they support government to take they money lol
He is a WEF member, say no more !
KC3 is a WEF traitor
Diana did say he’s not good enough for our country.
They're not 'the Windsors', thats a made up name they adopted. Their real surname is 'Saxe Coburg'. Germans. Fact. And yes, they're the biggest gangsters, peaky blinders, you nailed it.
Charles is run by darkness in he’s hart nothing but a WEF paid up operative working for our destruction of country and its people.
Understand that the royals wealth comes from our pockets. The Monarchy is a redundant concept. Kings and queens ruled the peasantry centuries ago and imposed taxes on them in order to fill their coffers. Whatever the peasants got in return for these taxes is now outdated. They have no purpose whatsoever. When they were a family, they were a draw for tourists, nothing more. When Diana died, something didn’t add up and it was swept under the carpet. Now that Charles is the figurehead, it’s interesting to see that they now appear to be invisible.  Charles also has connections with those of a shady nature, which isn’t a good sign at all.
Fair point
Thank you I agree 👍
Makes me laugh the royal family they all wear lots of shiny medals only one of them has been on a real battlefield harry and he was surrounded by an SAS squadron lots of medals for doing absolutely nothing
The decline and fall of Homo sapiens (sic), started with "urbanisation" about ten thousand years ago. (In my opinion). Cabals of psychopaths meeting to control the majority, some of whom might notice the tricks used by the former, becoming sociopaths. Thus the twenty-first century. Ho hum. ☘👿
Everyone has a bad point of view, even all the speakers on ddn. We could say you used to be a legal murderer.
My god , if the French rock your boat, you definitely haven’t lived there, maybe then you’re appreciated the open minded society you come from.
I don't support royalty especially Charlie  boy
Like Commies in Russia took the power by violence in 1917. Same way Tudors took the power in British Isles but lot more earlier.
THANK YOU, JOE GLENTON, FOR SPEAKING THE TRUTH.  I COULDN’T AGREE MORE! ALL MY BLESSINGS TO YOU & LETS HOPE FOR MORE & MORE PEOPLE TO AWAKEN AND SEE THE TRUTH OF MONARCHS, GOVERMENTS, BIG COMPANIES, THE CABAL & THE SLAVERY OF HUMANITY. IT IS TIME TO LIBERATE OURSELVES & TAKE ACTION AND RESPONSABILITY FOR OUR OWN LIFE & CREATING OUR DREAMS FROM OUR AUTHENTICITY.  Excuse my English, I am Leticia Roel🍀from Mexico.
I absolutly agree with you. They are in power because of the slavery, robbery, and death of our british ancesters. They are an expensive gimmic that many people revere. I don't get the royals at all.
The Last King of England?  Sounds like a good movie to me
I'm surprised that they haven't taken you down. Love your work and yes you are wright about the royals
Hey, I’m an American, so I never could understand how you can bow before another human being. Monarchies are no longer relevant.
Always saw them as thieves,full of BS! Now I realise they are evil !
My love and loyalty died for the Monarchy when  the Queen died. End of
Get a life all of you
😂😂😂 Prince Charlie with a parachute reg hat 😂😂😂
♥️♥️🇮🇪🇮🇪
you are so richt oke
I have never heard such imbecilic nonsense, such ignorance of history, such venom from a man with obvious psychiatric problems as I have heard on this extraordinary video rant. God Save the King!
I have more respect for Robin Hood than the whole english monarchy.
Thankyou for your service and Thankyou for the truth
Queen Charles is a ................................................
There was a documentary  of Philips life time butler that gave details on his death bed he know who Diana's  death was down to god bless him he said I'm so glad iv nothing to loose by saying what happened to diana
Full respect it about time people stand up to the thugs of the world. Not my king!
WHO PRINTS THE MONEY?   The D-Evil Ones.
Why does the alternative to a hereditary monarchy always have to be a republic. We could have an elective monarchy with elections every 20 years to give some stability.  This period to outlast several prime ministers. But how do we stop old politicians put out to grass applying for the job? I think I would prefer our present system but with no Crown powers that politicians could misuse.  Cromwell was a nasty piece of work. The Levellers in front of a firing squad and in Ireland 43% of the population wiped out. Be careful what you wish for. I like the Austro Hungarian Empire. Stability for Central Europe and would have been a bulwark against Hitler.
I share this same feeling. I am not a british... but this feeling is common and it touches me deeply; because it is the spirit of man, the spirit of FREEDOM !
💯💯💯 they use us as lab rats They trade on population control by erasing poor people just to get power among 13
Loooool
SUCH PURE IGNORANCE! a mixture of jealousy and misinformation designed to give an acid voice to the self-pitying morons in our society.
What a refreshing discussion. I am retired and I don't support the monarchy despite as a younger man taking the queens shilling and joining the RAF. I believe there are times when wars are unavoidable. I also believe that we don't make ourselves safer by disarming. If you have a big stick and walk quietly through this world who is going to pick a fight with you.  However from an older mans perspective the young need to take an interest in politics. At the end of the day you get what you deserve. The young shun politics in Britain, and by enlarge don't vote in any where near the numbers that old do. That's why the politician's ignore you. That's also why they favour the older voters. The Europeans the French and German young people get out on the streets and make the politicians sit up and pay attention. You must do the same or for ever be marginalized and ignored.
Charles is a traitor, and as a supporter of foreign entities ruling over us, should be kicked off the throne. In fact, there is mounting evidence that something very nasty lurks within the Royal household, with the dodgy demise of princess Diana, the Nazi links with prince Phillip and his Uncle Lois Von Battenburg (cleaned his name up by making it sound english), then close chums with Saville, and Andrews smashing mate Jeffrey Epstein. Charles has that natural organic Duchy food brand, from all that land that he stole from the Cornish people, but supports the notion that us peasants shouldnt be allowed to eat anything apart from insects and bugs or genetically modified frankenfood. In all, I think the Royal family are nothing but total scumbags and make the mafia look like kindergarten in comparison. I wonder what other atrocities will be revealed from these revolting people.
Finally a real man not afraid to tell the truth!
KING CHARLES 111 IS ANNOINTED BY RABBIS TO BE THE MESSIAH KING TO ISREAL SO ISREALI ZIONISTS HAVE BIBLICAL PERMISION FROM KING JAMES BIBLE TO SMITE THE AMALEK AS PM NETINYAHOO STATES. JEWISH RABBIS ALSO CIRCUMCISED PRINCE CHARLES SO HE MAY IN FACT BE SECRETLY JEWISH AND A ROTHSCHILDS ZIONIST.
What are you ssying? They already live in a council house.
Haha . And I'm sure if the royals where all gone that tony.blair or current pm would hand out all the saved money to the born and bread British folk  Hahahaha .silly boy..
Cromwell was NO better than the monarchy!  He took religion to the top of the hierarchy.  Same sh*t different pile.  There will always be corruption in the hierarchy.  I would rather have order than chaos.  All the leaders of the world today (save perhaps Italy) are dictators and run by the  most evil elites.
Iz Oily Heinous. An arch proponent of Build Back Better / Global Reset etc. Global Governance etc ...whatever, he it was with his friend Anal Schwab who fired the starting pistol. A drive for us all toward servitude, surveillance and CCP style world, deprived of all freedoms are dignity. Not my king, an execrable pompous grease ball.
Charles has always treated the people of Cornwall like serfs.
Nurses are actually very well paid
We need to be a republc. No more monarchy or elites hanging around the Royals .
Oliver cromwell was a king in All but name
TYRANNICAL MONARCHS ARE THE NORM IN ALL COUNTRIES WHERE THEY INSTALL  MONARCHIES.  BUT IT IS UP TO THE PUBLIC MASSES TO CLEAN OUT HOUSE.  MONARCHIES ARE A SIGN OF IGNORANCE AND LIMITED INTELLECTUAL THOUGHT. CHARLES IS DISGUSTING  WHO AXED DIANA ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,  AND SHE KNEW IT BEFORE HAND.
Not just "In bred morons" but foreigners who think that incest is somewhere 'normal'.
Can make a start by Scotland and Wales becoming independent and Ireland being a united country
Wonder why they still call this most filthy family in charecter , racist and proven terrrorist in history as Royal family ?
Well done! Keep the good work up mate! From Australia!! Pack of SNAKES!!
This is a vile rant and is not the best approach to achieve a much needed change.We’ve had enough of yob mentalities,a more common sense approach,calm and determined would hopefully win the day. Away with you.
Almost 700k in views but only 64 likes . Great video . Love ya work man
The good point of hereditary selection is that sooner or later you must get a good one with elected politicians the choice is between bad and terrible. Unfortunately with this man as king we're at an all time low. No, maybe it's time for change.
Let's not forget the this tribe of gangsters we're best friends with the worst paedophiles in the modern age, Jimmy Saville, Bishop Peter Ball convicted paedophile, and Rolph Harris convicted paedophile, who used to stay at Buckingham Palace. And Charles support for Peter Ball when he was convicted.   Remember Mountbatten and his fondness for little boys. Andrew for his friendship with Epstein and young girls on that island.   Really is this the best that we can have as king, if in fact we must have one at all?
It's a sad comment that all that pomp and poop is going on,while we the common people are struggling.
Dry your eyes, mate. They're staying.
Anarchy, Libertarianism  is the way
Do something about it all instead of you muslims they his crown befure u all its over
I support the RF but not their secrecy, cover up, undertable dirty deals, immoral adultery, spoiled brats like Andrew and sparry and their entitlement.  By covering up and change their narratives with the palace PR, coward kc is cheating lying to the people everyday.
You are not a soldier but a traitor to your country, that’s why you and the former, how dare you talk about the commander-in-chief of the armed forces? The royal family is the best thing in your country and the money comes from his lands, first read about the grant, the family provides it itself, it is disguised that it is taxpayers' money.

👏👏👏👏👏👏👏  well said my friend. Keep up the good fight 💪
Could you talk any faster?
He's a Marxist. Probably a puppet of the Chinese Communist party.
Respect Regelui🙏🤲🤲❤💯
Wow. Interesting. You make some good points yet your presentation in parts is about as thuggish as you ascribe to others. We are all caught in our histories and conditions of birth, conditioning and social structures. One doesn't have to be mean-spirited to advocate for change of some or all of the conditions in which we languish or luxuriate, whichever the case may be. I've given the issue of monarchy some thought and I find myself turning to the USA for inspiration. They do go on and on about their famous revolution and, at the same time, recreate oligarchy. They are desperate for kings and queens, dubbing their celebrities 'royalty' and creating political dynasties such as the Bush family and many elite powers behind the throne, or what they call 'the president or White House. They are about as close to democracy as any Monarchy in the world at this point. There seems to be a deep human drive to crown a leader and abdicate personal responsibility in favour of setting up a scapegoat, be it queen or president or the Wizard of Oz. If there is to be a monarch, I believe King Charles is a brilliant one. He is erudite, congenial and servile to the role he was born into. You don't have to demonize him or anyone to make your point. In fact, your character assassination of others weakens your point for me. It leads me to want to know how you got so superior. The rest of us mortals labour under conditions that largely determine our lives beyond our control. The British Monarchy is popular, not only in the UK but beyond. There must be some reason that people still resonate to a constitutional Monarchy. There must be a reason that the British revolution didn't hold up for more than a couple of years  (I agree that it should be taught in school). I look to the character of our species and of other primates. There's an inborn hierarchical nature clearly represented in all of these species. What to do with it..? Ignore it and end up with a bunch of flim flam Hollywood stars and ruthless capitalists operators with no limits on their influence as royalty? Educate the public to grow up and take political responsibility, something even the French have failed to complete? Orchestrate another civil war and end up crowning a new line of monarchs (Emperor Napoleon comes to mind)? These are important questions. I'm an anarchist and, therefore, don't want any leader or military but I see the value of a constitutional monarchy given the general public's adherence to tradition and servitude. By the way, I didn't catch what you "EXPOSED" about King Charles. Nothing that isn't obvious. And nothing about him as a person, only his role. Not very nuanced. And, referring to someone's "fat fingers" as a critique of their professional aptitude is childish.
Hi, these people jus keep us as slaves as they have done always. How long are we tolerating this?
the bloodline we have subjected ourselves to through our disobedience.
After a Cromwell, the royal establishment made sure they alignment the military with themselves. The Prostestant Army was Cromwell's power base. Charlie I was treating with foreign entities, Charlie III with the WEF!!
Thank you for saying exactly what I have been thinking for many years.   The are all a bunch of greedy entitled useless thieves.   I do not admire them.
my grandad use to say they were the biggest gang in the world and you wont beat them....he was ex nhs worker ..  .)
As we all know, we are in the 4IR. Therefore, should we rethink and consider whether they are still needed or indeed required in this modern age or should they be removed? I think the latter…
This King may be the most Unloved one. But I do Stil Pro Monarchy. Many people think republic  is better, but it isn't. , behind  republic  systems  is freemasonry that is Bloody Corrupt  and oprecive and manipulative. Just study well what are republic  sistems!!
"Inbred Morons"......so accurate
Personally I would rather not see Charlie exposed at all, thanks all the same. Leave the dubious privilege for Mrs Charlie.
You have balls brother 🤙I'm not sure, but I think the royal family has a TV show on Netflix. That must be a lot of work, don't you think?  It's certainly no picnic for George IV, who is 128 years old and suffering from lung cancer. It's amazing how few people realize the world wars were blood feuds and a fight for economic power and control between factions of the cabal.
@deebars7413 - Britain is more broke than America.  At least the US has natural resources. BTW, the British artists who speak truth to power are the old Russell brand (not so much.) and the new Russell Brand, who should change his name to Russell Firebrand🤣 Hey, its not much better here in the US my friend. Constitutional freedoms are relentlessly under attack. Tell MI6 to stop sending new talent to the US. The queen is desperate to abolish the second amendment. If you think the cartel has lost its influence, think no further than COVID. That calamity was perpetrated by the Pirbright Institute in collusion with the CDC, and if you don't know who controls them, you should. Go back and look at the London Olympics opening ceremony in 2012. Incredibly the queen is featured jumping from a helicopter with James Bond (007). In numerology the number (0) represents a new spiritual beginning and is associated with intuition. The number (7) is very spiritual in Christianity, as it is the number of days it took the real and only LORD to create the world, including a day of rest. it represents spiritual development, enlightenment and inner wisdom. However, James bond has been around since 1962 and is clearly predictive programming. What we have here is a glimpse of the future from a demonic perspective, i.e., trans humanism.
Royals DO NOT bring in money to the country but they do bring in money to there house
I am a sovereign spiritual being having a human experience and I answer only to God. IMO believing these earthly "demi-gods" enjoy sovereignty over you by virtue of birthright is the same as idolatry. Yes, I have read the Bible, “Romans” Chapter 13, but we must consider who authored the genre. These people are not appointed by God, if they were they would not need to be coronated by the Pope. But they were allowed to consolidate power in their former Roman provinces if they pledged fealty to the Pope, kissing his ring and stuffing his coffers in return for coronation. The Caesars and aristocrats of the former Roman Republic and Empires didn't disappear, they are now wealthy families you have never heard of, and some of you may have (ie the "godfather's") living in Italy, one of the most corrupt countries in the world. It is no accident the Italian intelligence agency allegedly facilitated the 2020 US election rigging. The Romans could never completely conquer and control Germania (unlike the British, who incredibly, despite the naval challenge, were conquered by Claudius in 43 AD) and to this day the Italians vie with the Germans and freemasons for control of of the western world. One cartel is from Rome, disguised as the Vatican; another is German, disguised as Switzerland (the fourth Reich including the BIS, the IMF, the WHO, and the WEF) and the EU (Brussels, Frankfurt am Main, Luxembourg and Strasbourg); and lastly the Masonic cartel, disguised as the US Federal Government centered in Washington DC.  The British under the former British empire, with the military power of the British navy and the economic power of the East India trading company and international banking centered in the City of London, effectively challenged these two groups for global dominance until the freemasons, including the Jesuits and influenced by the likes of Adam Weishaupt and Alister Crowley, and supported financially by France under Louis XVI and Russia under Czarina Catherine the Great, liberated the American colonies. The Brits are still a powerful cartel organized under the Commonwealth of Nations, who pledge fealty to the British monarchs. Only appearances change, most things remain the same.  "None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free." ~Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Interestingly Goethe, a German, was born in the "Free Imperial City of Frankfurt, Holy Roman empire" in 1749. As I said, some things never change.
You speak well ! Very well described
I loved our late Queen.But as soon as Charlex became King and made that woman Queen l knew in my heart its all a sham
Good morning sir hope you're all well Bureau of all people should know Prince Charles was executed the Queen was executed 2018 if you had your eyes open you would know all this
king charles the Turd. I now strongly dislike All royalty & govern,meant 🖕🏻
Charles is a founder member of WEF, that should tell you everything. Phillip said he wanted to come back as a virus to destroy mankind. And Covid was released just before he died. Mmmm
Canada here. You made my day!!❤😂
But, but, but ...  Lucy Worsley !!!
what a mong
Look at France now. LOL  This sounds like a malcontent teenager.
horrid man king of fuck all
His best mate Jimmy saville would be proud
They shit on a toilet made of gold while food banks run out of food it's absolutely disgusting
I'm a little disappointed that you didn't point out the fact that they are literally Luciferian pedovores and despise humanity. Cheers.
Did you know British history is hardly covered in schools, since at least 2014, it's all other Countries history or other bizarre topics that are under the history badge but not actual History.  Any History that was taught was mostly American, the kids I know always mention the fact that British education was a mess! and was taught as if Britain was being erased.
Great video, totally agree with you. The only royals I every liked were Diana and Harry, and both left the family, although in different ways King Charles is pushing the WEF agenda, therefore he is working against our best interests and working in the interests of the elites/corporations. Time to get rid of the monarchy, just a bunch of n>>>>s.
Even 50 years ago when I was in the scouts, at the age of 11 I refused to say the pledge "to God and the Queen". I have been a republican and anti-monarchist for all my life!
Here.in.Aotearoa.new.zealand.the.Maori.people.have.been.trying.to.take.back.their.land.that.was.blatenly.stolen.from.them.criminals.they.are.the.pricks
Charles needs to step down!
King Charles wants to be part of the WEF agenda and fly to Davos. He cannot do this as a king of England and should be for the people of Great Britain, however, the agenda is to make people poor and controlled in the smart cities. Bill Gates wants the state to sanctify murder and get rid of the carbon units. But the English Parliament is lost in following the USA. The dollar is failing and BRICs are forming alliances.  The King should stand up for the British. Princess Ann has done really well for horse riding and charity work and she knows that she works for the people.
The Union owed its birth to a Treaty entered into by Queen Anne as head of state of her separate Kingdoms of England and Scotland. In other words, the Treaty was not concluded by the Parliaments of England and Scotland, although legislative acts of each Parliament followed the conclusion by Queen Anne of that Treaty.                          David Walker, Regius Professor Emeritus of Law                                                          in the University of Glasgow,, 2007     The Acts of Parliament were  given to both parliaments, the Acts were not read or debate but simply passed due to the royal fait accompli
GREAT VIDEO  THANK U, SHARE, SHARE  AND HOW TRUE U ARE, A CRIME FAMILY LIVING OFF THE PEOPLE WHO FOOT THE BILL WHAT A RIGHT OUT SHAME
There will never be justice in a nation until every one of us is below the law
Why do the British support the royals?
At last someone who speaks the truth about the corrupt monarchy.

You could always deport them back to Germany
NOT MY KING
😄
USSR fixes easily.
Respect to Joe. He has some super giant size nuts. King Chaz has told the poor of our land to recycle old food... just use your scraps you peasants.... and stop moaning your always hungry... and yet in secret he is busy buying more lands and stately homes for his favourite boy Willy and his Dumbo gold digging wife waity Katey... Very thoughtful of him. ... reminds me of the times of Charles Dickens.
Hahaha you said everything better than what I think those useless snobs are
A friend of jimmy savile too.
Any one know what shop the Royals buy there medals from because they never earned one of them
You are brave and incredible I salute You
Freemasons and Rothschilds' own them lock stock and trafficking rights
Spot on
I thought it was funny, going from gradener to king, with nothing else in between. His favorite flower is the delphinium in case someone is wondering. He has planted thousands.
Check out Windsor Castle full of kidnapped children
I only recently became aware of this fascinating, intelligent and eloquent man, and now I can't stop listen to him...and I can't stop wondering how he once was a soldier. It somewhat restores hope.
The point that the Monarchy is there to safeguard our Security & Co-existence need to be seriously addressed. Is it simply a ruse to guarantee their existence?
Salute.🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋
Modern society is distracted by bread and circuses, McDonald's and mobile phones, not much chance of them waking up unless they stumble onto your channel.
Baie Waar Ontroon die GOED!!
King Charles is WEF
Can’t disagree with with a thing you said tbh.  What would you replace the monarchy with?
I agree 100%
I can't get over the time he crashed a BAE146 into the end of a runway then let the captain take the blame.  He was heavily criticised for not taking the controls from Charles - despite the massive power imbalance involved.  Why didn't Charles just man up and take responsibility - it's not like he could have been sacked from his job as Prince of Wales.  If he's incapable of doing this he has no business being a head of state.
+1!
Theres worse happening in life  He just made a step to save Palestinian and Israeli kids  Leave him alone ✌️
love this video
I have never been a fan of the salks gotha coburg crew , and I hate being under their thumb, canadian , where we are expected to kiss their royal bums
Prince Charles is trying to kill us all and enslave us with his wef buddys
long life to jesus crist
King George should be ruling this country.. but two death way way back in the day ended the blood line    .   This is where this lot took control
The queen rides around in a pure gold chariot while Brits struggle. Insane!
The foreign import will expand and bring down the royal family…. The British are not strong enough
The monarchists have more power in Australia then ever before. We just had a referendum to acknowledge  indigenous Australians but it was defeated by the lies of the elite monarchists.
Super video 🙂
This is @JoeGlenton a great right we have to be able in our westernised countries… political debates and democracy is at stake. I also believe History needs to be addressed and be brought into the light 💡’Lest We Forget’ … Commonwealth land laws? Aren’t The People under The Commonwealth, have the ability to Squat on that land? … or, maybe not ?…  I have difficulty attempting to balance/weigh-up ⚖️ if No Royal Family 🟰’s Opening The Door to Comunism/Socialism/eventual Dictatorship in the long term… A Watchdog’s Watchdog, Watchdogging Watchdogs… 🤷🏻‍♀️ I DO KNOW I HATE WAR! However, No Soldiers 🟰No Warriors 🟰No Defenders 🟰War/Invasion  ??? Truly, what is The Answer❓to the pivoting comments you make - do you have all the answers ‘cause I didn’t hear any of peaceful and mindful response - each button pushed in me by listening and thinking of what you said in this clip only ended up with my feeling Hypocrisy within, it’s a struggle for what is on the Other Side of Rising Up in suggested Rebellion - we, any of us Human Beings who have read any History of full rebellion all lead to War and Arms-Manufacturing and Drug Companies who need to supply that demand/need… and so, the snake begets it’s own tail -and the never-ending Global struggle begins, always with the people as ‘fodder’
I’d love for this tosser to present somewhere where destroying the monarchy worked. China? Russia? Korea… erm, probably not. America? Yeah nah. Syria? Iran? Nah.   Notice how the most stable countries in the world just happen to be constitutional monarchies. What a coincidence.
I agree entirely. The 'Monarchy' is a very sick institution.  I despise the British Class System, with them at the top. From Australia
a load of crap
Mr Joe Glenton, Sir, I thoroughly enjoyed and totally agree, with your words. If one knows anything at all about this useless, paracitic entity, then the so-called `monarchy´ in Britain, can go to hell...once the billions have been taken back and given to the British folk!
How about the rumors about his illegimit  son  he had with his wife.?
I’m a monarch, but I agree with you I also can work as a doctor just like normal people. I can help my family and also people around me and it is fine (beautiful actually)
Just a shadow of his mother.
The royal family sees the British people as mere subjects and yet the Brits line up in long line to get a glimpse of them. LoL
They are pour evil 😢
Now this is a true soldier for the people. Thank you.
I DETEST ROYALTY.  Years ago, when the elizabeth and phillip came to BC, there was a police escort and road blockage.  I drove my car through the escort and blockage without looking left or right.  The irony was that others were also doing the same thing and pursuit by the police was impossible.  That still leaves me with a good feeling when I think about it.
well said my friend ,all true , but what to do about it ??????
We may mock power but we do what they tell us. The problem is that power corrupts what we need is a system for the people by the people etc, Sweden , Norway come to mind and I’m sure we could come up with something better. Looking to America is easy to see how a democracy can be overturned in just a few years with a moron like Trump at the helm, I agree with everything you say about the royal family but I can’t say I’m enamoured by the quality of the politicians we’d end up with to replace them.
Love your comments , my main gripe about their existence is the que of sycophants that exists to suck up to them and creat a class system
Interesting rant,  but not ONE fact that "exposes" King Charles!?
He's just an anti-monarchist. Yawn.
Brave guy coming forward and saying the Truth. Pretty sure Charles is going to die and William will step in.
Charlie looks guilt ridden he know s we have him sussed and his nasty siblings with their false smiles and sickly smirks !
I was interested until you started to say there was a relationship between getting rid of the royal family and improvement in ones hair quality.
You sound like a fascist reject😢
May I add, for those who watch from other shores, that the Royal Family’s nucleus refers to itself as “The Firm”, if ever there were a clear sign of what it represents, this is one …
Nice hair sexy really lol
Non of us are meek…  They don’t care only for their own rights
Yeah neo and global colonialism  Their all guilty.. Hence why we can’t complain  Because some are blind and will cry when it takes full effect  Don’t conform
Yuk neo and global colonialism  We are all fked they sold humanity out
Spot on mate, all the royals from the world over are nothing but criminals. They invaded, stole, murdered, raped and enslaved the peoples. Yet we've been indoctrinated into exalting them as our sovereign rulers. I to served in the Aust army infantry, trained to fight for Queen and country, once I had the epiphany, f off, i'll not be fodder for crims. And yes the British crime gang pseudo monarchy sit at the top of the pile.
I Lost respect since they involved themselves in politics … supporting Ukraine supporting Israel … it’s telling
i took the queens shilling that means i worked for the state ,would i do it now no because your not working for the crown and country your selling your honor for ritch 1% monsters
Top man somebody eventually thinks like me my ancestors came out of mid evil villages I wouldn’t walk to the end of road to see them posh dictatorship
"Republic", I like the sound of this word and the idea behind it. An elected head of state, only elected representatives, and make every vote count!
THE REPTILIANS WHO HAVE RULED EARTH FOR MILLENNIA HAVE INTERBRED TO PRODUCE ALL ROYALTY. THEY THE REPTILIANS ALWAYS LOVE TO SHOW THEIR POWER AND HIERARCHY IN MILITARY PARADES. ITS TO DEMONSTRATE WHO ARE THE ULTIMATE RULERS AND WHERE THEIR OFFSPRING ARE SITUATED IN THE HIERARCHY. THEY LOVE IT. THEIR DAYS ARE NUMBERED BECAUSE TOO MUCH INFORMATION AND EVIDENCE HAS GOT ABOUT THEIR RITUALS AND DEMONIC PRACTICES. THEY MAY LOOK SILLY AND STUPID WITH ALL THEIR PAGENTRY BUT IN THE PAST THEY WERE VERY DANGEROUS AND LETHAL. ALWAYS WORKING IN SECRET.
You are so  correct  in what you say.... but why don't the People  make him abdicate.   They are the parasites  of uk.
Halfway through and you haven't EXPOSED anything. Just a general rant.
The K.M. infiltrated the monarchy of all the euro countries. Charles and many before him are of that ancestry bloodline. If not those about him are and rule him through sexual blackmail. It's very apparent here in jewess of A. Why would it be any different in other countries. Blackmail has always been a weapon of the darkside.
Many Brits hold up the monarchy as part of their own identity as in we have a king or queen and you do not. We in association to our king or queen who is higher than an ordinary person elevates my status in association because I am a British citizen. Brits are therefore above the fray. In reality Brits subsidize the monarchy and that is what they are there for period.. Worship, bow and curtsy and pay for the monarchies existence and pleasure.
Thes leeches  need to go
Yes well as a Canadian the Royals are a large part of our culture too though not as much as my parents generation.  Traditional indeed the serfs are to keep their chin up take their lumps not complain etc.  Charles Father was in the Navy for world war two but I don't think he or Andrew did any active service though Harry served eight years and had two rounds of active duty in Afghanistan despite that and his losing his Mother at the tender age of 12 people like to target him as the spoiled brat for leaving his family for an American girl.  Americans love to worship celebrities too they have rich people on their magazine covers that are not even well bred in tradition like the Royals but that all seems odd to stalk people for photos and gossip when indeed people are starving or being raped in the streets etc. Their highnesses making a speech about mental health don't do anything to prevent the trauma causing the mental health trauma in the first place.
🤑
WEF Invisible Holocaust.
I have a British friend.  She's about 45. She had no idea what we were talking about when we referenced The Glorious Revolution.  We thought it was a huge event in Britain's history.
Good Man!
Now that Britain does not build any thing in term of factories, new hospitals, and schools, the royal family will be made redundant because there will be no ribbons to cut....
If you want to talk of taxes, freedom and democracy, you should learn a bit more about french history. Their revolution was not initiated by the people but organised by this class of those who had become rich and wanted the power.  Nowadays, the people are more burderned by taxes and are mores belittled, ignored and crashed than during the monarchy.
Check your ancestry...I think you will find that you too are probably descended from those self same thugs...the maths alone suggest this...Being a British man, Edward III is probably your 21st to 24th grt grandfather.  That means you are descended from the Hammer of the Scots Edward I... Envy is a destructive emotion.
Totally agree with you mister,parasites. The fucking lot of them!
The *FRENCH!* 'Nuff said...
The young don't want the Monarchy, the young hate the Red and Blue Tories, the young disagree with injustice, the young want big oil and gas gone. Wait!!! can they still play their XBOX and not actually have to March, travel, leave their bedroom????
Ahh, Watt Tyler. Wondered whether you'd reappear. Not learned your lesson yet, I see.  King Charles, if he has ANY sense, will keep his head down, shut up, and do his job. He no longer has a right to free speech or an opinion in public (which is why I'm glad I'm not a royal). If he smiles, frowns or shows any inappropriate emotion for a fraction of a second in public, it's all over the papers and news media. The House of Windsor owns large swathes of British land and most of the coast up to 12 miles out. ALL the money from that is collected and given to the govt. which then returns 25% to pay for the Royals (you can thank several monarchs including Charles II and William III for that). They are paying for themselves with 25% of what is rightfully theirs. Throw them out, and we lose 100% of that income because, believe me, shy of doing a French Revolution on them, if they are removed as head of state they have NO REASON to let us have that cash and it will take centuries for lawyers to sort it out. His ancestors made this country, fought to unite it, took it over, going back to William the Conqueror (obviously) but with connections all the way back to Alfred the Great, and Charlemagne. You don't like the fact that they more than pay for themselves (they pay taxes on their income as well, which ALSO goes to the govt) our of their own pockets, AND bring in tons in tourism (the Jubilee of the late Queen brought in 4 Billion (with a B) over the course of a long weekend), and think we'd do better with a costly, politically biased president, you're an even bigger idiot than your troublesome precursor, and just as ignorant but with far less excuse.
All royal families are a crock of shit and should be dismissed .
And replace it with what. Another Boris Johnson and bush family. The thing is we don't know who or what will take it's place. Algoods to say kick them out. Yep ok and then what who's not to say in a few years time we get a politician that doesn't want to stand down. Or a politician selling secrets and causes wars like in the late 80s I would like them to only have thier land no more public land give it back and zero tax from the public no more free bees. Upper class should be out lawed no one should be able use money for crony business deals and shafting the mid and working class out of big deals. It's called economic exclusion and its time it goes. That is the real boot on our necks.
His a Rothchilds
An embodiment of the class system and mediocrity  : NOT MY KING :(
Just go back in history to when this family dynasty began and secured power by genocide and terrorism after defeating the previous regime and killing all the British nobility before dividing the spoils with their accomplices.
4 million in a carrier bag
TRUMAN SHOW DEMOCRACY/BREXIT
Charles is far too involved with the WEF and globalists.
brave man
Bulshiter, you never fought for anything else but your salary.
Thankyou for you're service sir.....great video.
FFS his best bud was  Jimmy Sa.vile could walk in anytime why as sa.vile said "I get things done" what things did he get done 😢
Not my king.
He is a WEF shill with no regard for the British people. Unless you can show otherwise.
I call the monarchy priveleged sperm.
Draw a circle  centred on the equator to the tropics and call it the square root of point two. Then draw a line from mecca through rome and paris until it crosses the meridian, Then draw a circle from where those points cross to the equator and make it a hexagon. Then take a look at the cities on the map and see where they are placed and think again for the rest of the variables. Other people these days tell them where to go, what to say, and what to sign.    In fact, there is a new king and he knows of him.
It’s so easy to argue against the Monarchy when you try and make it about a particular individual and choose to ignore its history and significance for the country.
Great work 👍🏽
Correct x
This is a disgusting tirade from an anti-Royalist.  They DO work hard, especially Princess Anne.
Biggest criminals by far.
Great video, first time discovering you great to hear a x soldier, not sucking up going along with Royal propaganda. One day Royal bank holiday cost the economy £1.6 billion.
The Royal family are incredibly dangerous. They're waging all out war against us serfs, they're using biological warfare, weaponized pharmaceuticals, weaponized mass immigration, weaponized finance, weaponized media; academia, even the NHS has been weaponized against us. It really is us or them and they're winning.
What British people don't seem to understand is that the 'royals' are RUNNING the UK! The king's govt- MP's swearing allegance to filth! How LONG will the UK people keep getting KICKED in the teeth before they stop the 'royals'?!
Brilliant 👍 the truth 👍
Why the  English people are putting up with this greed and corruption ???
We have a constipational monarchy, i.e. full of shit with no apparent movement
The aristocracy of Europe, especially Great Britain, is loaded with jewish blood. I don't think you understand who the Royals really are.
It's only natural to have a leader or leaders - we even see this in the animal world, however I have never understood the reverence for this family of blood suckers we are all supposed to revere and bow to.  It's the year 2023 and we are still playing 'kings & queens'.  It's time for our nation to grow up and elect only those we feel worthy to rule and shut down this pantomime of nonsense.
Don’t they call the Royals “The Firm”?
Absolutely correct, well done, the real king died in 2012 in Australia, his family lives on.
Great video 👍 I hope you include Harry in with Charles
Agree 💯 % 👍  I can not understand those who put these up on a pedestal, literally!!
I agree with, but the French Revolution is pretty much nullified by its crimes all across Africa and French Canada. We need those french people whom were for genuine freedom and equality back in the world.

Fear is Power!!!
Good review of the Royals and Charles, but no mention of their friendship with Britain's greatest pervert, Jimmy Savile! They must have known what he was and yet year after year took part in many functions with him.
Isn't it interesting that those French had a revolution and we merely had a 'civil' war?
I totally agree with you. It is amazing that in this day and age , it seems time has stood still here. How does the country still put up with this stupid monarchy? How?
Well said i would have to agree, who would give his life for that twat and his hag who he was shagging behind Diannas back, hes an utterly gross individual and I for one would never defend that. Not my king.
Antichrist
I don’t see what insight your being an ex-soldier brought to what is your typical, over-the-top anti-monarchy screed. Republicans would serve their own cause better if they stopped acting like constitutional monarchy is worse than Hitler himself.
The ROYAL MAFIA 🕶️ FAMILY!!!👑🇬🇧💂‍♂️💂‍♀️
Charles cant run from his crimes...
Charles fingers are ruthlessly overweight
No such thing as king Chuck lmao. He is just a pauper with no authority. Jacob Rothschild is his boss.
Scotland largely rejects king sausage fingers. He is NOT the king of Scots and could not even TOUCH the crown jewels of Scotland, the oldest crown jewels in these islands. If he had worn the crown of Scotland, it would have had serious constitutional consequences which would likely have brought down the monarchy. The people of  Scotland are sovereign people, which means that they are equal to any sovereign and can pick and choose their own monarch. Had king Tampon been crowned with the Scottish crown, he could have been deselected IMMEDIATELY by the Scottish people and that could not be allowed to happen.
From Ireland ,joeand I,m sickened by you doing three tours in Agan and you had a conscious decision to leave and now your called a traitor to the crown their terrorists totallitarian monarckof pyscopaths,thanks for your service and don't let them get you down fair play to you
The BEST THING that ever happened to Harry was meeting Meghan.   He escaped.   He still has money from that system but NOTHING like what he’d have received if he had stayed and played the Royal Game.
I am a 100% monarchist I think a coronation is what we needed in this time the royal family are amazing and I am proud of I and I did swear allegiance to him I think we should keep the monarchy long may they reign  God save the king
Personally, I think what's good enough for Epstein is good enough for his partners in crime, including those who may not have participated but who still used taxpayer money to cover it up.
Disney for adults, how this relic of rule is still valid is absurd
I'm British through and through and I totally agree with you. The royal do nothing for us. They drain our society. F THE ROYAL FAMILY
The very notion of a "Royal" family is disgusting and immoral.
In this day and age we don’t need any king or queen and the WEF should be abolished
100% spot on😊
If the young don't get brainwashed first no change there either
I’m always interest to hear both sides of a debate. I always end up saying that the truth lies somewhere in between the two extremes of view and this talk is no exception.  I agree that the role and funding of the monarchy needs rethinking. There is a imbalance that is way out of proportion for this day and age. But it’s not like counties like the US and France have got it sussed. I live in France, life is not all equal, corruption is alive and well in the higher echelons of society and the same applies in the US. There is just as big a division between the haves and the have nots there as anywhere else I’m afraid.  What we need is a rise again of the middle classes and we must vote into government those politicians who are fighting for the protection of our individual rights and opportunities.
What a stupid  comment and argument.  The monies they and all that surrounds them bring to the UK is absolutely fantastic, if one travels the world, as I do on business,  everywhere our Royals etc are  topic of conversation for the right reasons. Seems to me green eyed people are work here. In all honesty who would switch their constantly controlled life with their own freedoms. You just bang on and on about all that you don’t have that they have. I certainly wouldn’t want a head of state such as Trump - just look at the mess they’re in - better to have a system where royals are above politics than that nonsense.
Thank you... For  Enlightening people that don't bother doing their own research. I couldn't agree with you more. If the Military forces (The hierarchy's body guards) were not so Brainwashed and gun hoe Then we could maybe make a change. But seeing how these evil people in power would commit Genocide of the people at the drop of a hat, we are just lambs to the slaughter.
Spoiled Chucky and all his pedophile friends can chuck it.
You are a dangerous man. with a huge chip on your shoulder.
Ren is certainly an artist challenging the establishment. Thanks for the video!
You are the only military man that talks crap about his former employer, was you dismissed for bad conduct and are feeling bitter.
The Beginning of the End for the Royal Family... Kicked off by the Queen's Death... Although this was building up for a long time prior! For me personally, the final nail in the coffin was the Harry / Meghan fiasco! An opportunity missed for this institution to modernise itself!
excellent
Not my king, not my monarchy, only my money.💸
Zelensky 4 President of U.K.
You are a disgrace to your country. God Save King Charles.
He had every educational advantage and best schools and he got 5 Cse's same as me and I mitched for last two years 😂
Se of the staunchest royalists out there, live abroad & are out of touch. I see them. They live in Australia & came here long ago when they were kids. They live a comfy lifestyle here. They aren't in touch with the quality of living standards in GB. They are deluded. I say the same as this man here.
Well said Monarchy is a totally outdated concept Nothing to do with equality.
Sad you feel like this .We're you this bitter when you joined up.😂.
I would to get some cute picture of princess Charlotte Prince George I'm Prince Louis I see cute and can't them anywhere kathryn rishar 36 e moreland ave apt 501 hatboro pa I love if I could and fimily picture I just  love royal family I cried for week queen elizabeth died I just loved her I thought of her as a grandmom I love princess Kate I'm Prince William I think you're such good parents please send some picture I will treasure them forever
Wow ! what a catalogue of dissent.  Who really knows what goes on with  this  family with such a powerful PR machine to smooth out the cracks and crevices - I have no doubt there  is a huge amount of those.  Whilst we curtsey and bow we admit that we , the people who create the wealth, pay the extortionate taxes are inferior beings.  Here is an old quote:  When Adam delved and Eve span , who was then the gentleman?
I’m not the French are better off. The PM has to meet with the king once a week to justify and explain what they are up to, I quite like that dynamic more so when the queen was still here. Who else will be above the politicians?
Send them to the  isle of Wight...

This guy is 100% correct Royals are monsters they have always been and it's pathetic that anyone has to give them anything at all. Stupid
He's not my king, and never will be. The Royal Family are one part of a wider illusion.
SHUT UP, you're talking utter rubbish, it would be a dark Britain without them, it would be someone like Sadiq Khan instead.  It's all symbolic!!!!!!!
It is a true testament to the awesome power of pervasive class conditioning that the British people didn't long ago do away with their parasitic monarchical system and the noble class of hereditary and life peers that underpins the whole bloated structure as the French thrice did with their own!
It is it, nirq, mmh
If we don't stop this madness.. then our children will curse us.
WE WILL TAKE BACK WHAT BELONGS TO US  THE PEOPLE , NOT THE SO CALLED ROYAL PARASITES , THEY ARE SCUM AND WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THEM COMPLETELY !!!!
I'm sorry I learned about Oliver Cromwell,  and plenty of others did too .
So true... that's why Harry ran away...
I couldn't agree more ... Charles wouldn't get breathing space in my life!!!  William is a better choice!
As a naive American, I wonder what the average Brit would think about simply downsizing the expenses of the Royal Family. Doesn't the Monarchy produce a large amount of tourism?
Born to squat over us. 😂
Someone who is not brainwashed Congrats and thanks
Its a illusion that we are different to communist countries.  We are groomed to believe the narrative.
When I checked the linage I found Thea's guys are German and the real lines are in Bavaria (Stuart)etc and more the Tudors etc see duke of Bavaria
I HATE those Child fiddling monsters... especially Andrew
May Allah grant you righteous companions, only then you will succeed.
Yesterday I have learned that a young girl working at the Nursery is earning £8.50 an hour, what a disgrace to the system! You should go a bit deeper and expose their satanic rituals and child sacrifices, adrenohrome consumers, evil satan worshippers! British Nation should unite and rise against the monarchy..
Where is the exposé? Was expecting to hear something I didn’t already know, just another republican rant
I think they're soon to disappear.  What a joke?
I would rather pledge my furniture
The Queen had 50 Billions private money.she never spent a penny. Everything the royals get is free. All the millions they get yearly from tax payers. Most of the Palace's are ours, but we can't live in them. We even have to pay to see some of the rooms. Prince Charles was the first Prince of Wales to become a Billionaire.  Its shocking and we need to dismantle the whole lot.
You are the carbon Charles and his WEF pals want to reduce.
He know people are waking up, he must go, the royals take money, that's why the queen always say never complain and never explain,  very clever makes her look good but deep down its her get out card to keep quite
This guy is a  soldier of jealousy and full of envy  in  him  he needs a good  psychologist  and some medication😂
Joe Gleanton is just a bitter Crap Hat! 🤦🏼😂😂😂😂
Stolen valor.
This guy needs to look at the heads of states in other nations that call themselves republic nations and how they become mega rich and what they do during their very short term in office , the darling war lord mafia in the USA for starters .
What does Joe Glenton feel about Prince Harry ???
Inbred nazi supporters their true country is german linage. King George and whole family plus Liz doing a sieg heil salute🤚
Perhaps the best presentation of the parasitic 'royalty'. All of them. Appointed by God? The best argument for atheism.
Monarch is good. Ot fights for its people. The problem is that king Charles isn't British, but black khazar nobility.
well said  we all know where they got all there money   stealing and killing
What pushed me over the edge , was the eco Uk sending uranium tipped artillery to Ukraine. Where was Charles ?
I visited Windsor Castle a few years ago. You expect some medieval weapons in a castle but it is more like a shrine to human butchery. It displays a vast array of killing equipment and the spoils of war/loot. The horrific weaponry was used to steal much of it.
Really, the monarchy should have ended when the Queen died, as she was the only one who kept to her word to reign, as she did.  The Queen did pay taxes when it was brought to her attention years ago.  And I do think Diana was murdered as a modern-day beheading. William has vowed to find out the truth when he becomes King.  It was the white fiat that bumped into them from the side that made them crash.  The driver wasn't drunk, he was off duty and ordered to drive them in the car.  He was on medication for some illness he had. Diana was a threat by being young enough to have more children. If, in fact, she married Dodi Fiad, and had babies, her children would have been Arabic half-siblings to the royal siblings.  So that wouldn't go well with the Monarchy.  Well, the Queen wrote that she wants Charles to give up the throne by the time he reaches 80 years to William.  And so the saga goes on and on.  Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when at first we try to deceive.
The amount of free publicity given the Saxe-Coburgs by the Daily Mail is an absolute farce. For some reason they STILL refer to Williams wife as "Kate Middleton"....WHY?.
The British people do not want him as our king any more as he is pathetic at doing any thing for our country and he is more interesting in his crazy deranged drugs crazy son and his mattress wife out with Charles and in with Prince William and Catherine the princess of Wales we want them to be out king and queen and not concort as our late queen taught princess Catherine well and she has never ever disappointed our late queen Elizabeth Charles stand down now u not any use to any country we need our king not a pathetically disgusting and a cigarette drinking wife out with the two of them
And the Bigest Joke. His H... is now the Queen 😂😂😂
Seems if he's just a bit jealous of the royals 😂😂
1815, Nathan Mayer Rothschild made his famous statement, “I care not what puppet is placed upon the throne of England to rule the Empire on which the sun never sets.The man who controls Britain’s money supply controls the British Empire, and I control the British money supply. The British monarchy are pedophile's puppet's and actor's the same as our government all owned and controlled by the Rothschild's
That British soldier should be court-marshalled for such disloyal utterances about King Charles’s-111. Unpatriotic rogue soldier!
The royals throughout Europe have married commoners , so the so called royal blood is being diluted . Why would we keep them in the lap of luxury , whilst some of the UK can't afford a decent life .
For any of the royals who mocked Joe dirt he wasn't inbred 😂
Amen
Monarchy makes little sense.
Immoral technique Vini Paz
If you referred to anybody else in the country as 'inbred' as a term of abuse you'd be in trouble.  You know it too, you brave little soldier boy, like you know they'll let you get away with it.  If you called for, or implied that you would love to call, if only you dared, for the execution of anyone else, the same, except it'd be bigger trouble.  I think that being a freely permitted target for all the abuse of the daily press and anyone who wants to have a go, is enough to justify whatever they get paid.  I don't think I'd want the job for twice as much.  'Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown'  was said a long time ago, 4-500 years;  everybody has always known it, unless they were immovably self centered.  And since this video has been being shoved in my face on YT for over a month, and I have no history of any deep interest in the subject, it is unlikely that the monarchy give a tinker's damn whether anyone sees it or not.
No matter how many times I tell the TRUTH about these decrepit parasites, everyone seems to still want to kiss their arses, it's really annoying to me
1:00 a couple of options we could do to the Monarchy. The latter would be funnier, better. Didn't they do it in China: The Last Emperor (1987)?
First of all, you’ve obviously had a bad experience in the Army. The Coronation will cost nowhere near that type of money. Irrespective if there was a Coronation or not, all those police officials and soldiers will be getting paid anyway, this is MSM shite.  The only monetary figure I know is; in 1986/7 having a Queens Guard Mount brought in over £3m per day, that alone is worth it all???
Church and Monarchy must fall.
What bothered me was him having his zodiac sign engraved on the crown. If he's defender of the faith, I'd like to know what faith that is, because it's not Christianity.
The Royal 👑 Mafia Family !!!😎
King 👑 Charles lll is a Genealogical Descendant of VLAD THE IMPALER Transilvannia 🇷🇴 the Inspiration for Bram Stoker's Gothic Horror Novel DRACULA 🧛‍♂️ 🦇
Thank you worth watching 😮
Glad to hear what you had to say..💯👍
TAFF from wales  i am from wales  THE UK GOVERNMENT IS NOT MY GOVERNMENT THE ENGLISH FLAG IS NOT MY FLAG AND THE ENGLISH KING IS NOT MY KING.
It's beyond comprehension that we are living in a world where these things are still going on. They're all in it together. Whilst the rest of the public are busy fighting over petty things like race, religion, skin colour, immigration... Etc etc.
Ok, valid opinion about our Royal family, likely held by many of us. However, the red flag went up when you wandered into communist Revolution as a solution. Right, you didn’t name it, but neither did the others who have instigated such direction beforehand .. They just sold it like you just have. And it was horrific. I think GB rightly needs its monarch. But not the Windsors, they are not the rightful or legitimate family. We should  know that by now by their fruit.
Well said Joe YOU SIR are a hero for the freedom of speech which is being ripped apart before us. I totally agree with everything you have said there and people have to know the facts. The media (I just don't watch tv) is doing what it always does  - promote monarchy & promote government.... I say these.... Viva La Revolution, #notmyking & #notmygovernment  When will people in our once great country wake up to these cockroaches? Maybe never. But come on everyone....share this video far and wide and challenge this tyranny before it's too late......  Well done Joe, well done DDNews, fantastic and vitally important work 👏 👍
CORRECT... WE SHOULD GET RID ON THE MONARCHY....  IT IS TOTALLY OUTDATED!!
I don’t know if you have looked at America. Our government is the same pockets full of money and we have starvation and homeless everywhere. Holly wood and the George Soros run our government when democrats are in office.   So don’t go off half cocked it’s just as bad as everywhere else. It’s the end of time. Jesus is coming and there will be only 1King and that will be God.    I had rather be in and under the monarchy and live in England than live here in the states.   Sorry I disagree with you. You have not looked a good look around you.  Our just a disgruntled person. Come over here and live. We have the Biden family coming under the gun working with china and Ukraine. We have FBI and CIA that hide the truth. We get someone in to work for the people they   Lie and put them in jail. We have the Clinton’s who are ruthless as a monster. They have killed more people than you can shake a stick at. Read up before you stay done crap.
STILL say Charles had something to do with Diana's death !! there I've said it.
Tax avoidance is their mantra. Charles and Bully boy William and that Edward who failed in the Marines play Toy soldiers. Sausage fingers with all his fake medals and Andrew the child rapist. What a joke of a family that the Brits bow down to like the peasants they are 😂
Charles is such an embarrassment to society as is his side piece Horsmilla. Love Prince Harry though.
This family have to fall. After the death of Dianna there days were numbered. If Dianna loved the family would of survived
That would be very sad indeed.  He is a good king and ahead of his time.
Thank you for your honesty and speaking your Truth. It's so appreciated.
Nothing has been here exposed, we know all of it. Thank you.
We could send them back to Germany
Sponges of society
The Queen saluted Like a Nazi when she was a child with her uncle. We know the truth.
The Duke of Edinburgh was a war hero. As a serving soldier didn't you swear alleigance to your Commander in Chief (Queen Elizabeth), isnt that oath a lifelong one?
The only reason it survived beyond its second sell by date in the early 20th century or earlier was to keep the working class in check and subservient to a visible entity with sentiment programming used to override reason and an intelligence divide between working and middle class cultivated to ensure no common intellectual ground be established to seriously scrutinize a glaring parasitic institutional entity as the bedrock of British society. The family themselves I believe in the grand scheme of things during the 20th century were highly privileged human shields to detract attention away from vastly more powerful unpalatable figures who would have come into the spotlight and focus of accountability if not for the superficial pretense that supreme power and limitless wealth was held exclusively by the figurehead of this family and state sovereignty belonged within the confines of the glorified dolls house or houses. Now it is merely a media circus show, the powers that once seriously depended on it in the 20th century to obscure the true nature of their power and activity simply maintain it and allow the whole dysfunctional mess and the absurd ageing new king to potter about aimlessly with no more meaning or purpose than a trashy so-called reality show
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I agree. It is time, as a nation, that we finally grow up and rid ourselves of the Windsor gangsters. It is difficult to see the monarchy as anything other than a grotesque institution filled with boorish, entitled, and irrelevant people whose only skill is the accumulation of ever greater wealth for themselves.
Incredible journalism! This is so witty and succinct, we need more of this.
Federations & Cantons power baes are a stronger egalitarian way, than country power bases, in my experience.
Well put
I would give them 2 weeks to move out, pick a palace, Buck House and Windsor is off the menu. Payments will cease immediately. Tax will be chargeable . I suspect they would all feck off to barbados pronto. Our nature loving twit head of monarchy, shoots wild birds for fun. I often share my lunch with wild birds. Who loves nature most?
I SERVED a career in the British Army. This thing on the throne is an imposter. When the queen died so did the Monarchy......The French revolution wasn't that long ago?  PEOPLE ROSE UP DUE THE RICH EATING ALL THE FOOD ETC! It could happen again as those who forget history are due to repeat it!
The British Royals are NOT the biggest thieves on earth. The Vatican controls them, and has existed for over 2,000 years as the Roman Empire. Why do you think all world politicians must go and meet with the Pope? Charles goes to the Vatican to get his orders!
The royal arches only started paying tax since 1997.I read once that the Queens alcohol used per year was 2.4 million pounds per YEAR. What an alcoholic.
Funny I should see this while I'm in Thailand, one of the few places that escaped colonization. And thank goodness, since Windsor has left many dysfunctional and this place truly is the "land of smiles".  😀
A democratic republic is the only viable solution
Albion hosts the devil worshippers that obey the blood thirsty jehova or geobaal namely Ialdabaoth  satanas himself..tell them that I say..Beware...their time is running out..
"...anyone with any critical facility..." That's the problem right there. Critical thinking in this manner is seriously lacking. Well done for speaking openly about a subject many people just won't acknlowledge.
As proposed in Australia almost 20 years ago, all commonwealth countries should have cut all ties to the British monarchy once Elizabeth's reign ended with her death. Charles wont be around long, launch the movement again!
Charles should have been more like his mum.......nobody knew her personal feelings, Charles the weak king is a tool of the climate change cult & the WEF!  Remember he only ever wanted to be Camilla's tampon, that was from his own mouth!  We know way too much about this (not very bright) man!
I wish Jordan Peterson would watch this.
Ax the royal family for your children's future
All goverments across the ages were and are founded on blood, corruption and greed but we are living in an age when they will all be brought down as they have already been judged
I agree, parasites!
Did you see the cementing of God and the power of religion in the coronation?  Wow! No separation of church and state there! Kings, Queens, dukes, earls, lords and priests etc etc should've all been relegated to history long ago. Divine right was nothing but smoke and mirrors to pull the wool over the uneducated masses. It's sad and pathetic that they we still give them power right up to when AI will rule us once and for all. As the saying goes... I welcome our AI overlords (please have mercy).
An elected head of State when corruption is so rife is a scary thought e.g. Biden??? 🤡🤡🤡
The English people should vote to get rid of the monarchy and nationalize the assets.  Unfortunately , the ordinary people are totally brainwashed.
wow this dude is all over them amazing
The British Monarchy should not exist.
You are  so right  it disgusted  me the coronation when  soo many of us are struggling right now😢😢 Get rid is what I think use there properties to fund NHS , the military, the homeless,  and to sort out the growing problem of asylum seekers!! Weldone on your videos will continue  to watch you proud unionist love from Scotland ❤
I wondered about members of the Windsors wearing uniforms and a million medals on their chests and having never served in ANY regiment, like Anne.... While Harry(who served as a helicopter pilot in an actual war) was denied.  Putting on a lion's skin does not make you a lion.
This video is full of lies. Former British Army soldier? What a wanker. Disgraceful.
Legendary.
I'm in Australia guest what  my flag is coming down so true and this sore of thing is happing here too with the heads of our AUSTRALIA  it looks like we are going to give back over 200 year too the black fellow due too they say Brittan took there land  which they never thought for back then and the one's born the same time as me have more owner ship too this land that we are all born on.
The royals are a constant. The UK isn't in trouble because of the royals. It's global conditions outside of your control and poor governance decisions when you did have control.  I'm an advocate for binning the monarchy too. I still think that wouldn't do a whole lot in fixing the problems the UK is experiencing.
they are just like the krays  bullys should be disolved
PIRATES!!!!!!!!!
Worlds biggest benefits family.
American; Our Revolution made ud all free and equal. Apache Indian; Gee thanks.
Extremely well articulated, Sir. Verily, they done got us hypnotised! Now the old Queen is gone, the scales must fall from our eyes. The Kings' Globalist Gangster mates want us under the heel and are actively promoting wholesale robbery and War. I assume the gros venor, Charles, is never far from the Royal bunker, these days.......
jimmy savile
I spoke to Charles in 1979 for thirty seconds. I was a cadet and spoke frankly which, I think, amused him. He needed a haircut then too.
Who is paying this guy to give anti monarchy nonsense ? Spouting a lot of nonsense.Getting rid of the monarchy won’t solve anything. Let’s just dissolve British history, the Church of England , and everything unique and great about our country. I don’t wanna turn into France 😂mate . Apparently they are cool and us brits are peasants. Apparently we can’t visit our own countryside, but we can!! Can’t get his facts right 🤪😂
Those revolutions only gave power to other bastards to kill and oppress people.
Las cosas por su nombre.
I laugh and then get annoyed when Charles visits Scotland and wears a kilt! His ancestors destroyed the Clan system and banned the wearing of tartan, carrying of weapons and speaking in our Gaelic language, if found you were doing any of these things it was death! We pay for the RF’s extravagant privileged lifestyle and their very existence but we are paying to bow down to them! Andrew and Harry have both revealed just how over entitled and  arrogant they are! The majority of Brits have been crying out for Harry to be stripped of all titles and of course are ignored! What happened to we serve the people! They serve themselves!
People talk shit if they were corrupt and bad you wouldn't be able to talk about them they would suppress your communications or put you in jail do you see Russians or Chinese most of the world doesn't have free speech you do wake up to yourself long live the king and commonwealth Australia's stand with the king try to kill him and you are an enemy to all of us
You are a piece of work  Never served in Nth Ireland 😳😳
Glad I never served with you ! You wouldn’t stand in my unit ! Untrustworthy and egotistical 😡
This chap is a bit challenged in his general understanding - the whole world is given shape by contending forces which may fairly be called gangs and operating rings whose activity may fairly be called gangsterism. The ethical forces controlling a descent into general anarchy and violence cannot fail themselves - as part of what they do - to use violence. There always exist transcendent possibilities for an ‘exit to the world’ - but in the materiality of what is termed ‘the real world’ violence and love - indeed true love - are the same coin but on two sides. A constitutional monarchy should be the final refinement of national process keeping anarchy at bay - it is to be hoped that this particular monarch comes to the realisation that the environmental ideals which he genuinely espouses have been taken over by people whose cynicism outwits his trusting nature.
Charly should be Sh-t
It shoul b an execution ,that would b better for this country .
You know, I never at my age thought I would live to see a world wide uprising to slay the really evil people of this world.  I'm talking about the elitists who control all governments.  I'm 60 and in great health, and I'm starting to think I may just see it as they are so blatant about it anymore that it's only a matter of time.   I can still dream!
Our last true Monarch is now dead. Queen Elizabeth 2nd was born and bred for the role and did her duties while keeping well out of the scandal rags of the British press. Now I'm not a monarchist, but I can still respect her for doing a reasonable job.  But her kids and grand kids are what epitomizes a dysfunctional family. Charles and Camilla carry so much bad baggage, it is impossible to like these clowns. They will be the death of the house of Windsor and lead the UK to becoming a republic at  last. If the crown had dodged Charles's unworthy head and moved directly to William and Kate, there could have been some hope for the continuation of the monarchy. But old Charley wanted his coronation day and that will be their downfall.
Give NEIL OLIVER a go, he's got 'it'.
Precisely how did the French Revolution Change ALL the French's live's so much ?  Oh, it's OK for you to have YOUR favourites.USA is DISMAYED THAY HAVE NO ROYAL FAMILY; only Have the MultiGenerational, Crooks Kennedy's. Look at Parasitic POPE, & vatican Bank.
I couldn`t agree more, monarchy should be abolished
1* Prince Harry is doing all celebrities including royal family members a great favour to take the media to court to showcase their in human tactics  and even corruption to earn a living without talent or creativity in communications  2* Anyone can pay the print media or social media  freelancers to publish Toxic scandalous and character assault  articles . 3* The historic example was the life of Princess Diana who they victimised till her marriage brokedown and continued and chased her to her death   4* Only the Courts or judges have a fair idea on how this kind of character assasination is destroying the Rich  famous  and put an end to it   5* The world is starving for creative ,talented and brilliant journalist ,writers and editors  not peddlers of scandals and rumours !!!
Charles is too Weak to Roul his County He Only  Wants to be King 👑 and Can't Take Care of his own Son is Rooles Over Him Shame On You King Charles 😂
War is when the government tell you who your enemy is; revolution is when you find out for yourself.
King charles, lovely bread of dog, thats as far as my intrest goes with the monarchy.
Thanks for this wonderfully informative video, good job!!!!
I feel I’m home!! Totally agree with every word you say. In the dark ages a monarch run his country and led it in to battle. Nowadays they sit in their ivory tower leeching millions from the taxpayer to fund their lavish lifestyles doing nothing for the country. That money should be used to help kids living in poverty, not funding a small family of nothing other than vermin! As you say out the lot in council houses and make them work for a living like the rest of us!!
Vive la République !
I agree with you. I get angry when I see princes Ann in uniform like a freaking tin soldier.
so disgusting he wipes his nose on his gloves like a three year old
And he was identified as the antichrist Prince Charles of Wales 666 and coat of arms has the imagery revaluations the Bible tells about him the antichrist
And the Queen couldn’t find the wisdom to take things in hand when Diana was showing signs of distress… unforgivable …
Hm, theoretically and historically you may be right about those royals, but let's not overlook some non-royal-no-better figures, for example Hitler, who wasn't a king, or the recent USA's establishment, also not kings... And why particularly this King Charles? I personally have a moderate to good opinion about him (without knowing much about him, it's true).
You nailed it ...
Spot on. They REALLY lost the plot when they 'DESPATCHED@ the ONLY beautiful person that had ever joined the royal family   > The Princess Diana
1:25 beautiful😂
Subscribed. Keep it up guys!
I'm from Australia and grew up  with a severe bad taste in our mouths around anything Royal ,it was common for Australians to ,but these days Murdoch has sold the biggest lies to the highest bidder and most people swallow the tripe believing its Lobster ,Military cosplay ! love it if this wasn't so serious Id be laughing .PS I Stand with Roger Water's is what bought me here to DD
The USA has even greater inequality than Britain, with something like 40% of the wealth controlled by the top 1% of the population (and Americans are born into rich dynasties, just as the Royals are born into royalty). The 100M pounds spent on the coronation was a good thing for Britain. People got paid, British companies got paid. Although in some theoretical sense, the money could have been used for pay rises for nurses or whatever, the reality is that it wouldn't have been. Even if it had, it wouldn't have gone far. All the overseas guests at the coronation (and the Queen's funeral) paid for themselves, bringing money into the U.K. You ask what does the monarchy actually do? We don't know in detail, but the monarch does do a lot of soft diplomacy with overseas countries, helping to bring money into the U.K. economy. Whether that might involve selling British made arms to be used in foreign wars, I don't know.
I believe everything you say.
Bravo 👍
All royalty should be abolished  Royalty is a drain on their populations
The royal family are nothing but lying, thieving murderers and they have done for thousands of years, all over the earth. The earth doesn’t need them so neither do we.  Plus, he married his cousin didn’t he people? That’s only my opinion though
Sheep love to bow down to the will of the dogs.  I say ha,ha,ha at all these british royals watchers.  Sheep love to bow down to the will of the dogs.
The idea of the "ordinary" people taking possession of the establishment's weapons and flags for ourselves is the most frightening nightmare scenario for the establishment. That would be called terrorism by them, and it always will be.
I have dropped out of society completely I am not interested in playing thair games I even have my own pension fund that I control because this is one way they have a hold on people with pensions,banks, and housing
The richest man in the world is the LVMH guy in the Republic of France and the second is the Tesla guy in the USA Republic.  Unless Charles is not on this list for some reason, I don't see Charles, or symbolic Monarchy as the main problem.
The french fucked it all up when Macron was voted in. Now they belong to the WEF like Argentina and Canada. We need a revolution but we need to protect it from these institutions
The royal family qre Noth but puppets of the Rothschilds since WW1. In WW1 Britain was bankrupt. And the Rothschild took over. That's what created Isra Hell.
This ex soldier really knows what he is on about I totally agree with all points in this
fantastic
100 million to pay for coronation.......443 million is collected every day in taxes, its a drop in the water, focus on bigger things this was a small gig, pointless and a waste but still a drop, its a show, theatre, It only becomes important when people make a big deal about it, just imagine if we ignored it all
nothing was exposed here we all know this is bullshit
IMO you are still succumbed to the uniform. The uniform is a symbol of slavery, its a representation of you giving up all of your rights to serve, to fight because some leaders disagree, wouldn't it be great if zelensky and putin were put in a ring and fight as an example, but nope, you all put on the uniform and fight on their behalf, earn little pieces of metal that symbolise your dehumanisation i suppose. And thats the perfect soldier, a robot, follow orders no questions asked, you asked questions, bad soldier. I understand your attachment to the comradery and the feeling of it all but recognise its a symbol of slavery. If you choose to fight when you dont need to you have become  part of the war machine, war is a last resort, not a career or job, its a last resort to preserve life ironically at the same time taking it, oh jeeze its a big mess
You're the product of disenfranchised revenge, not justice. If you're so antiestablishment, then why do you use your former military career as something that's implies honor or credence? It doesn't, it shows hatred, anger, and redirected bellicosity to replace 1 regime with yours, and it's not unity.  You're an anarchist, whether you realize it or not. Some anarchists just want to be left alone, but you... you want the world to burn. You want to topple the regime, and at any cost. Well, I got news for you... the world would be far worse off if everything collapses. You were sold and brainwashed a patriotic lie, but when you discovered it, you, being petty and petulant, sought revenge. And in your vulnerable state of confusion, some opportunistic new brainwasher sold you the replacement lie of anarcho-communism... and you myrmidonically followed their new lie. because THAT'S what you do. You're a follower who thinks he's a leader.
Wow... Eyes opened and mind blown, well more than before anyway, I knew and still know how disgusting that family is.. as an Ex-forces member, name, rank and section I will withhold due to the fact that I'm almost embarrassed to say I'm Ex-forces... I learned so much while away on duty and the memories will stay with me whether they are good or bad, but one thing I will say is this, I put my life on the line for that family and what did they give me in return, a street to live on, bankruptcy, a divorce, and debt... Thanks Charlie,
Harry is the only brave one amongst them.
Here in the US, I think Charles is a pompous joke.
His allegiance is to WEF Not the British people.
😂😂😂 love it
The Antichrist and a cup of tea.  Worth a look.
Documentary of Hammer family,  yep your king got millions from them .
On both the funeral and the coronation I went to see my local football team play in Leith. HIBERNIAN FC situated within Edinburgh(sort of) The club was formed in 1875 by a priest within the new community of Irish immigrants following the blight ( and the rest of the shenanigans by the UK monarchy)  On both occasions it was heartwarming to hear 20,000 fervent born and bred pillars of the community sing in unison “Maggie’s deed, ha hahahaha “  during the minutes silence And subsequent “Chas the nonce” isms…. throughout the following  coronation game, although a minute’s silence for Chaz’s big day would have been more appropriate as the mourn would be more in keeping within 90% of the Port o’Leith consciousness ( please do not confuse Leith being part of Edinburgh, that was the establishment  Undemocratic takeover of Leith in 1922, so the city could pocket the vast tax opportunities the port could provide being one of the largest contraband ports in Europe at the time ( nothing to do with the fact that Holyrood House  I.E. The Kings Royal household in Scotland, was just outside the tollbooth separating the two cities). Fat fingered pinkie rings all over that illegal land grab.   Ironically , moreover across town it was during the pathetic coffin parade along the  Scotlands capital tarmac that one upstanding tax paying member of the public on his lunch break called out that Chaz was a nonce as is his right in a fair and free civilised democracy and instantly got bludgeoned and battered by several police officers and random members of the public taking free liberties ( obviously that was CID , that’s their M.O) ….. tale of two cities eh   GGTTH
Even during height of empire, the ordinary people were destitute
When James was killed, the yahoods were in power with Cromwell. As good as!
The Arab royals are the same. It’s a club! Also, actual city of London where the real {{{controllers}}} are
Well Jesus and God love's them said Charlie
Just make yourself sound completely jealous of who they are, what they do and more than anything their wealth.
Sorry ,, but I loved the Queen
The Monarchy is a Joke and the Royals are the most degenerate family in UK history. Along with our government the Royals are neck deep in the WEF. And today they've proudly announced that Jacinta Ardern (a proven fascist) is to become a Dame, ffs. 😂 They are the Enemy to this country and all it's citizens.
Not forgetting they cynically changed their surname to 'Windsor' to hide their  Austro-Germanic heritage in 1917 because Britain was at war with which country?
Agree, and this is one family amongst the 'Black Nobility' the canaan bloodline originating from Eve.
🤮🤮👎👎sounds sour grapes.🤮🤮👎👎🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Same goes for "Mayors" of this country, what is the purpose?
Made his people take an oath to him , While he commits Treason against them He is a total puppet of the WEF
off with his head!!! the interviewer of course ....the miopic prig
your blameing people that where not born for the past bird brain
If Charles had wanted to gain popularity, he could have toned down his coronation and given a gift of money to all UK citizens living under the bread line.
One word…REN! Where is the artist who is not afraid to mock power and sing about our true and real humanity? Here he is. UK- get behind him
Charles is the head of the Committee of 300, he is at the top of the WEF and those fascists in the US and the City of London . They are the head of the snake, along with the rest of old European inbreeds , they are still at the top  and using their power to entrench themselves. They own you and everybody else, they own everything and intend to keep it using every means. They own the power of the Freemasonry and are using it to implement the power downwards.
This country is all about the Class system! The government is all about keeping the workers down and using them as their "cash cows"! Its getting harder here surviving; expensive houses and no chance to live a self sufficient life. Very expensive overpopulated island government created to keep these peices high and workers working for it. We are all part of their Matrix. Used as a 'food source' while we are deluded by constant lies. Im off to spain with my irish passport. Its not perfect but cheaper houses; land and sun. More chance to be self sufficient with energy; grow food and leave the wet; grey; returning dracronian beliefs on good old Britain. .
I wouldn't necessarily say the French lived longer after they got rid of their royal family. Especially during the Reign of Terror that immediately followed on from it.
Fkg brilliant, simply fkg brilliant...
Looking at the history of this institution both external and internal, I am concerned for the future of the son who left because the monarchy cares only about itself and his wanting to effect change firstly by paying his way and asking for things to be done  differently as exemplified by his wife in the Greenfield kitchen. His bid to remove manipulative power from the tabloids...........I am concerned for his life.
"is it really theft if you are taking it back from thieves?" - gold.
The more I learn about the royal family, the less I like them and the C of E church leaders with their unacceptable nonsense and cover ups of atrocities within.
The woke creepy bunch that that the royals cozy up to like the Obamas, Bidens and the Bushes says it all.
I am in the WINDSER FAMILY LINE.
I HAVE WILLS AND PROBATE PAPERS ON MY TREE BECAUSE I AM A GREAT GRANDDAUGHTER. THIS LINE GOES TO THE ANCIENT KINGS  DIRECTLY.  YOU CAN PROVE YOUR POINT ON THE MAIDAN NAME ROATH TREE.
Oh heck...another nobody wanting his five minutes of fame...
Never tip your cap to anyone
What's the alternative, President Blair, Starmer, Sunak, Corbin. All you'll do is exchange one corrupt system for another. France has political riots and murders. So your answer is unleash the beast of the loudest and most violent and have a fuhrer bringing stability at the point of a bayonet. Young man who thinks he has the answers, don't knock down your house until you have somewhere else to live.
Wow very impressive. And your intelligence was breathtaking.
The Royal family plod around with their fake medals  Never fought in a war. Fake titles.  People are really suffering can't afford heating,   trying to survive on shitty wages and Royal family celebrating a coronation of a so called King that nobody likes.
Spot On!!!! Well said.
Is Sax Coberg Gother the head of much more than a gang ? Have you seen the pic's of SCGother with Schwab in 1974 at one of the first WEF meetings ? Is it a gang or the fourth riech?
Yes he is the man of lawlessness and just one of the many antichrist legions that are under the position of false power and authority. And the people who are accepting this same tyranny and frauds who keep the people in poverty oppression and outright disadvantages. Being that they control the main source of main stream media they are able to manipulate the false images and the truth that they are all impostors
Were your heroes all men????
The support is declining and a lot of support for the monarchy was out of personal respect for the queen not a support for the system as such. The royal family has prepared for the nation to become a republic by marrying normal people, owning private property and if offered to abdicate would rather that than a civil war to preserve their position
I honestly think that the devil worshipping Charles had Diana killed so he could marry the much uglier camilla
I'm an American and I totally agree with you I can never understand why the paparazzi follow this bunch of inbred around and act like they are so special there is nothing special about them and I think you are a more upstanding citizen than they are. Plus I am honestly starting to believe there is alot of evidence that they are devil worshippers including Elizabeth that just passed. I can honestly say that there is no way that the royal bullshit family encourages me to visit England, I would just like to visit England for sll the other sights the royal family is not one of them. I really would like to see them lose the power, they really think they are better than other people and they are inbred pedophile devil worshippers.sorry that is my opinion.
Putin wants to end the Norman conquest of England
Join the Union 🇺🇸
Hope  the monachy  is no more.
The Danish crown price is widely respected - for being a REAL soldier! No, of course we can't send him out in battle, (not that we have any) so in stead he prooved his worth by crossing the Inland Ice on a dog sledge with the Sirius Border Patrole. No body can ever question his toughness! We're proud of him.  Charlie would have had to bring an entourage of valets and servants - maybe even his Nanny? Nah, that was Andrew, wasn't it?
Now your police are arresting folk who simply have a "NOT MY KING" sign   -  may God be with you
Thank goodness for people like you 😀
Very insightful view.  Cheers from Belgium, mate 😉
THANK U 4 SHARING THESE FACTS!!...LUV FROM canada/CHINADA...
They get excessively rich off their people and give nothing back but a half-assed wave. Sell the jewels and help the poor. Just found your channel. Love the content! I am joining the fam, from 🇺🇸
Take from the poor
They are incest reptilians
great points well made , abolish the monarchy .
well said
Lets not forget he was besty with Jimmy Saville!  He should have gone when Andrew et - both belong in the tower dungeons!
I agree with you 💯 lets become a Republic ASAP
they created religion to cover up the truth, killed ppl who did not comply,   its all unfolding NOW       NWO agenda,  purest evil agenda   PERIOD
Looser
More hate and no debate. I’m no royalit but this is just fodder for the unobjective and ignorant.  Our society is the product of history, it has created what we have. It is unjust and bias. But to debate it when all you bring to the table is hate then don’t expect to have the attention of open minded and objective people.
A man with balls who spews the truth with no fear, great video, great words. 👍
I think Charles or Camilla had Diana offed.  Diana Knew things.
You are brave true soldier well done been so open and true full on 👍👍
Proud of being British really ? - -and you all still are, why  ?
Inbred thugs would be a good description of these paid to do nothing so called Royals.
Yeah, attack Charlie, because politicians don’t do anything wrong do they? Noooo….. of course not….
My boss asked if I was going to celebrate the coronation ?  I said I have 12p in the bank after paying my bills . I'm not watching millions being wasted on a prat when the NHS  could do with that money 🤔 😕 🙄 ps LOVE THE SEX PISTOLS 🤣🤣👏👏👏👏👏🙌🙌
A really sad and angry little man.
They are corrupt CRIMINALS
Also, this 'pledging allegiance' to King Charles is somewhat...... Disturbing??! 👑😱
I was shocked at the power that Charles had when he was Prince from the research I watched by Tim Cohen. Now that he's king of 56 countries, is it his desire to be king of the whole world?
The last British monarch to fight in a battle was George II ( who was straight up German) in 1743! I could never foresee Charles III doing anything for the people, he is a completely out of touch royal living in his own pompous world of excess! And if people seriously think he gives two shits about them the peasants, ah no....and don't get me wrong I don't hate people with royal blood then I would hate myself as am a German Gräfin, but unlike him I am impoverished and have worked my whole life!!! And I am not ashamed of it either hart arbeiten!!! German's we are always Proud of working hard! Although Charles real family name is Saxe-Coburg-Gotha they changed it during world war I to distance themselves from their German cousin's like der Kaiser Wilhelm II. But nothing of true honor lives in them! King Charles II who actually during the great fire of London went and was helping putting the fire out, which is something Charles III would never do, get his hands dirty to save the city.....
Just like the children's riddle  story " humpty  dumpy sat on a wall" wel and you know the rest❤  😂
Saying anything is fruitless. We all need to learn to trade with each other. After all what good is meat without bread? Bread without heat? No taxes on trade. We don't need leaders we need to be leaders ourselves dealing humbly and honestly with each other in trade.
Give us  Equality, Fraternity, Liberty or Death was the cry of old. The royals are an emblem of racist parasites and yoke of the british peoples.
Revolution, war, fighting, is stupid. Everyone should love and respect everyone . Kings should behave themselves
R.
I agree with your comments, but we need a non-political head of state and occational pomp and ceremonies to rally the people. The royals add gravitas, which a political hack doesn't.
Britain also has a rich history of some dumb Monarchs too lol. From the Stewart's through to the Windsor's.
I came here as a bit of a monarchist but left not being one!
As an American I am amazed by how meny Englishmen allow all this pageantry and pomanstance to continue. On the taxpayers pocketbooks .same here with our Goverment spending  outrageous amounts of cash to the point of bankruptcy of an entire country .in my option it is extremely STUPID to allow the greedy few to have such power of oneself and the taxpaying masses .the leadership of each and every country are the same .Greedy,selfserving , Backbiting ,Elites who set THEMSELFS up as demi-gods .Satanic and evil  windbags.
Why did the the British tax have to pay over 100 million for the coronation when the royal family is one of the richest familys in Britain if  king charles 3rd lives for say another five years then go through it all again with William
Absolute power  corrupts  absolutely.
I don’t want anything to do with that family they can call them sells what they like but he’s not my king and the ather half well she’s definitely not my queen there no my family
🇺🇸sounds much like our screwy White House. All evil.
Why does the people of UK give money to the royal family. Why stay in a huge house that they didn't buy. Royal family should go work coz they don't do anything.. Just look posh.
The only reason the crown hasn't dropped down around that inbreds ankles is the jug ears keeping on his peanut head. I saw certain qualities in his mother that I respected & even admired. In him see only that I as a man despise. Thank you for boldly speaking out & of course for your service. Another one of our retired armed forces heroes has a U-Tube channel. 'The Angry Bootneck'. Would recommend subscribing to it.
They can go and jump in a frozen lake!!!
Yesterday's anti-establishment are today's elites and Champagne Socialists.
Weren't kings originally thought to be divine?  I do not know why you Brits put up with a monarchy So sorry to see the anti-monarchists arrested during the coronation.  Anyhoo, we are across the pond and still trying to get rid of trump and the rest of his facist nazi sycophants. Good luck to all of us.
Same thing happening in the united states. Difference, we have a government that runs the country for we the people. It's sad. And what he did to diana, shameful.  She was beautiful and kind. Now he's stuck with a mommy horse, cow, crow.
He's a useful idiot by birth , he's a figure head but the real power is with the people who control him just like the POTUS  , just a face for the uninformed to look at
LETS NOT FORGET, the British king aspires to be camilla's TAMPON.  And apparently he succeeded.
I would love to see you having an argument with Piers Morgan about the monarchy.
I found my " Doppelgaenger ' ! We do not look in any way the same, but, I share his well-put and convincing arguments completely. It is always better if an Englishman expresses these sort of views, then one of us from " over there ". Joe Glenton a man with radical common sense, a rare man in our world indeed. On the global march to Fascism, he will be high on the list to be silenced.
it’s nice to hear of the differences among the British people , it’s a refreshing perspective .. the mainstream  media portrays most as nationalists, but there are independent thinkers who really care about the state of their country and the ppl living in it .. i can understand the frustration especially with the cost of living
Traitor should b in jail

Im no monarchist but beware of what you replace it with.  Cromwell was a very bad man. He banned Christmas and dancing! He should read his history properly.  Ask any Irish person what they thought about him and his regime. “To hell or Connaught”.
I think it’s rather naive to think that abolishing the monarchy will create a utopian society where everything is fair and just. Human societies are by nature hierarchical. No monarchy means another layer of political corruption. I find it amusing that people blame the monarchy when it’s the politicians who are running the country and fucking up😂
Join the English constitution party
People like this were called a barrack room lawyer, he's not to be trusted. He'll run away when it get real.
Give the man a break! God save the King 👑
Well said.
The Royal family has no concept of what real life is about. They have never gone hungry or gone without heat in the home. Look in Charles' eyes,they are empty and void what it is to be a real man. He can't add up and never will. This is what happens when you spoil and over praise a child. They end up like him. His brother Andrew is no gem either.
Stealing from thieves…❤
saxe-coburg gotha is the true name of 'house of windsor' -name of windsor was 'adopted' by them in 1917. Because saxe-coburg didnt 'sound very english which it isnt. order to reform unfair repulsive taxes.
They are serious scamsters
Thank you for your real truth … it needs to be exposed …
Exactly … evil despicable so called Royalist .. Charles needs to be arrested as the rest of the royals should be …
Thank you for your service.
What a load of crap. Get a grip.
Please be careful you are openly honest. People are no longer honest.
I agree!!!!
I have never liked the monarchy but boy do you like the sound of your own voice.  You just ramble on and on.  Just saying😂
Imagine being unemployed for 70 years while living in your mums basement then “Boom”! You’re King 😅
Imagine being barely able to feed your family or pay the rent and worshiping an old man in a gold carriage
Brilliant ! Exactly how I have felt for years, thieves & liars all of them.
Many say Charles is the Anti Christ this video shares all, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpVIiYVyum8
I think "Ole King Woke" will quickly find out that the Monarchy under him will be no were near as secure as it was under his Mother the Queen I always thought the Crown of this Country should have died with her!
They’ve already got a council house 🎉 Buck House and a Council Castle 🎉
let's become america 2.0
Don't miss Dr.John Cambell's recent video.
I think Tony Blair should be president. He seems like a trustworthy sort 😂😂😂
Just unfair greedy ppl ..
The same could be said about the charade of democracy over in the west we get told we’re free but we certainly are not free. People who hold power abuse it that’s always been the case but we can go cast a vote for 1 of 2 shit parties who make a load of promises that they never intend to keep but god bless the right for us to vote. You talk of lands they hold and estates and that they should belong to us to walk on well I’m sorry that’s bollox we can’t even keep our children’s play areas clean and safe what the hell do you think we do with an estate or a manor it would be a graffiti laden crack den. Hatred of the royal family is jealousy so you suggest we get rid of them sell their assets and share them amongst the people ok so ten years later when all the proceeds have been used up and no one has really benefited from the pillaging of British history then what do have left? I’ll tell you what would be left the same bitching moaning populous trying to blame something new for their own misgivings in life bringing up how bad the royal family is a using examples of acts of tyranny committed 300 years ago to justify their opinion. My allegiance my whole life was with the queen not some upstart shit bag politician who slimed his way up someone’s grease pole to get ahead
Charles u will have to stop drinking. Ur fat fingers is a sign of kidney problems.
This man know exactly what he’s talking about!  Thank you sir!  Let the Monarchy FALL and fast!  Family of freaks.  😡😡😡
You should also criticize the people that benefit from these. All magazines and all nobles. For many that are not that wise is a possibility to stand over others despite being empty headed.  Born simpleton but with all privileges.
Did America.....Actually Separate from Britain.....or did they just become a subsidy to do the dirty work.....?
I have said the same things for years. Many people here in the states run after them, all Gaga. If people knew their true history they'd be more than shocked.  Grifters with their hands in everyone's pockets. The people can't eat , heat their homes, while the "royals" live obscenely, caring only for themselves and how else they can fleece the people using the green agenda which Charles is so involved in. It's time for them to all go. Live in normal homes they must work at a job to earn the money to buy this home. Here in the states we have our own problems with lifetime politicians. Look at the criminal acts of all the presidents. Biden is by far the worst. We need term limits. Remember that where writing your new constitution.
Totally agree. The monarchy should be abolished. Nobody needs a morally deficient tree hugger to be the head of state.
Screw the royals
It's great to hear someone put it in a nutshell.  Never ever like the idea of royals.  What's royal about them. Inbred bunch of takers
I LOVE Charles and accept Camilla.... see what your fingers look like at 75 mate.....pfft.... what a grizzle gutz.
he is not my king - i do not consent
can you please give me a written thing of what you speak of.i agree to you completely  but cannot follow as you speak too fast.i am german.thanks
As a direct descendant of William the Conqueror, Our Dutton Clan still have rights to the Throne, I despise what leaders have become, They should love and protect their people, Not Rule over them, Love them and be thankful for the chance to rule with grace, strength and kindness, And then you could be a great king. I too old for the crap or I'd challenge his Rule. Dutton Clan is watching.
I'm from Ireland and I couldn't agree with this guy more!!
@ A MOMENT AGO, 'PUTIN' WAS EVEN LORDING ALL OF HIS PRAISE UPON THIS MAN, AS BEING A RUSSIAN SPY. WITH EVEN AN UNCONDITIONAL INVITE TO LIVE WITHIN RUSSIA.  AND SO NOW ' WE ARE ALL SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE??? THAT WHATEVER IS SAID AGAINST 'CHARLES', DOES NOT COME STRAIGHT FROM 'PUTIN'S MOUTH??? IN AN ATTEMPT TO DIVIDE US ALL SO THAT HE CAN GRAB HIS LITTLE CONTROLS OF OUR NATION?  'PUTIN', U R AS PREDICTABLE AS A PIECE OF 'LOO ROLL!!!'. YOUR HEAD READS LIKE AN OPEN SCRIPT'.
British people's are slaves  they adore the Lion king
the king was a adulterous cheat who loves fox hunting a terrible entitled man apologising for slavery in Jamaica is mad considering he's not involved and of no interest to me and never will be  If he has £100 million he should pay for his own coronation and security
The king says sending immigrants to Rwanda is appalling what's appalling is this man butting in to things that don't concern him but he was mates with Jimmy saville so it's no surprise  Immigrants are invaders illegally
Couldn't agree more!  I think lots of peoples allegiance to the Royal Family died along with the Queen. Charles is a consummate liar. He lied at the alter when he married Diana and lied to her, to his children and us, the people,  for years. He has done everything and anything he could to put that horse faced adulterous wife of his on the throne.  Henry VIII eat your heart out! His behavior and treatment of his youngest son, his wife & family is beyond shocking, but very telling.  We all have family problems, not all of us like our in laws and there's no law that says we have to, but as the patriarch of a family, he should understand sometimes we have to do shit we don't like  just to keep the peace.  It's life, it's family life.  William is huge snob and looks miserable, what's he got to look miserable about? As for waity Katie, his wife, didn't her family do well!  I'm convinced she's a robot, a stepford wife or like Camilla smashed out of her face on valium.
Agreed
Truth
Well said. 😮
How old is king charles
Oliver Cromwell, took their power away, why? Evil .The government has replaced them with Evil .
our royal family is not the problem, our form of government is the problem
I’m not a royalist but fear the alternative more than anything. President Blair/Cameron? No thanks. An elected head of state will be a Masonic hero. The Windsor mafia is no doubt corrupt but does anyone honestly think politicians in general aren’t at it? Look at big pharmaceuticals and US politicians. Please don’t be naive to think the Royals are the worst.
Since 323 B.C., the world's hegemonic empires have always moved Westward beginning with Macedonia defeating the powers originally constrained in Mesopotamia. Even before that time, the notion of the "DIVINE RIGHT of KINGS" has always been at the forefront of all dynastic power. Unfortunately, mankind has always been generationally cursed to re-enact the age old story of CAIN v. ABLE. (MA of History) The quintessential question that has yet to be fully answered by history is this: "Does mankind have the ability to properly and constructively govern himself?" So far, the historical record simply checks the box: "No, he does not."
That so call man will lead the world 🌎 army for the final battle of Armageddon , when the real king comes.😮
Vote for your leader!
💯
Fat fingers like that are signs of adrenachrone abus.just saying
Supporter of prince Harry speaks his bile, the royals are richer and more popular than you , get over it or shut up, your a loseer
I am American, but I have always thought the same , while they like our leaders live fairytale live all the while their people are suffering. It is all out of hand and something needs done . thanks for the video hope it does wake people up .
Ex Army too, I totally agree!
Very interesting points of view.
You are amazing thank you for shinning your light ❤
Because Jesus Christ is the only king, these people hide behind God back and doing bare Evil 👿 and oppressing the poor but most people choose not to wake up.
After 5:00he speaks about the new model army, agitators, and trade union like stuff. That's exciting. Can anyone recommend good video/website/books I can learn more about this? Also, are there movements in the U.K. [and wherever the reader is located] that are inheritors of that movement or advocate it?
You are right on, Mafia is a English word it simply means a government not representative of the mass. In Britain and America until recently we wear under the illusion that we are represented but in the last year since the pandemic we are fully aware of it all, some are in disbelief. Charles the 3th is a member of the WEF, any one with any common sense knows what kind of people the royals are. Mafia, cast, clan, cartels what do they have in common? History repeats it self. A real democracy is from the people, by the people, with the people, Abraham Lincoln one of the American president assassinated like the Kennedys. This says a lot about America today.  Today the real mafia is to be found in the above mention organization cast, clan, cartel, " Banks, Multinational, Pharmaceutical Companies, Bobbies." Kings, Queans, politicians, prime ministers are their poppets. We as people have no place.
Thank you for speaking out and speaking TRUTH all my life I’ve been saying this but as an so called uneducated Blackman you get called a conspiracy theorist,and that we have a chip on our shoulders ,and why are we so aggressive and I’m sure if the masses really knew the TRUTH they would feel the same way,keep up the good work that your doing brother ONE LOVE.
Sad the French model cannot be openly advocated, which I won't lie they kinda deserve for all their hundred years of injustice and wrongdoing. But they can starve us and that's fine.   I get what ya mean though, I agree putting them to work (although it won't change them how ya want it to immediately) will do something.
I agree with most of what you say but the so-called democratic system we have in place in most western societies doesn't work either.  And the main reasons are, that each 'elected' government understands very well, that;  [a] whatever they do during their short term, and as bad as it may be for the people (including blowing billions of taxpayers money), they will never be held accountable.  And [b] the worst that can happen to them, is to lose the next election and try again later.  Also, 4 or 5 years isn't really long enough to improve any erroneous decisions, injustice or corrupt system.  I believe a better system would be something similar to what Poland had in place centuries ago.  ONE ultimate decision maker, namely a Monarch, HOWEVER, not through birthright but an 'ELECTED' King who 'is' held accountable for his actions, and can be immediately dismissed by the nation's people if he screws up.  This gives the King (with his advisors);  [a] a longer time-frame to put in place the required actions to improve the lives of his citizens, [b] the ability to hold public referendums regarding any major new bills and laws, and [c] the motivation/incentive to actually do a good job, or he will lose his privileged position and have to reap the punishing consequences of his careless, detrimental or damaging actions, by - instead of beheading - financial penalties or prison time!  No 'passing-the-buck' permitted.   It would be to the King's benefit, to do as good a job for the people as physically possible... for his long-lasting support, 'likeability' factor, legacy and continued  privilege!  *Unaccountably and the ability to 'pass-the-buck' onto other politicians or previous governments, with zero personal consequences, is what leads to corrupt and inefficient leaders and governments.*
Who cares! GO A WAY!!!!!pathetic little man
Come on man your brit buck up and kiss his ass like a good brit
every school child in UK should be made to read the Putney Debates.
I hope Joe you continue to be a voice of challenge as a autodidactic and not an establishment 'academic'  your continued insight and experience of the falsehood of the presented status quo should be on our  school curriculum .
👏 👏 👏  England fucked !! If st george waz here
Thank you for your courage to speak up & out about these psychopaths!!! Support you 100% 🙌🙌🙌 Time we took our power back from these criminals!!!
KING CHARLES FIRST A MONEY LAUNDRY  AND HIS BIT OF SPAR IS NOW QUEEN NOT A MAN TO FOLLOW  SHOULD NO BE KING
Vous ne changerez pas le passé, encore moins l'histoire;Ce n'est pas la faute de Charles, je ne crois pas que s'il avait à choisir il resterait sur le trône,.Il y a aussi toute la gentry anglaise qui exploite le peuple.Il faut des sénateurs qui défendent le peuple comme madame Clare en Irlande
History .. His story,   just who are we talking about ?
Under Thacher there was a stiphen put aside be for your people's for power bill and the queen had the nerves to put in an application to get government assistance and was denied.
These grimey tax dodgers have serveral council house in England and Scotland. Even randy andy has a free gaff.
Spot on joe Glenton! What thuggish parasites
Well said couldn’t agree more, what gives them the right to all that money when we have people on the streets, it stinks!
How they came to power and wealth. Ownership of our lands etc. Studying the history of how they got to the positions they are in stop anyone from feeling nostalgic. I remember my mother telling me how the late 1930's the King and Queen visited and drove through Stockport. She, like everyone went to the roadside to see them pass. My mother and most around her were very poor. No proper clothes or shoes. Seeing these Monachs drive past in all their unbelievable finery. Such limitless wealth made my mother see how unfair society was and was never a Royalist. The "them and us". Its all a con. The church as well. Corrupt. Greedy. Not the fair utopia i want to head towards. The greed is so great they will detroy cultures, soil, air, seas and oceans to create the vast wealth with no care of tomorrow.
Spot in bro, parasites!
This is great. It totally explains why I left England in 1962 to reside permanently in Australia. Problem is, Australia with it's vast natural resources shared in "Commonwealth" !!??, style, is THE major important jewel in the King's Crown. How the people of both England and Australia cannot actually SEE, what is really going on, is beyond me.  How can a whole continent the size of Australia , brimming with natural resources the way it is and shared between a relatively "tiny" population, have any poor people in it at all? Please ask yourselves this and think about it. Think. Does it actually make sense?? Please.
ask yourself why it didn't work out last time and think to yourself what would be different next time there will always be a power struggle there's always one who wants to be top dog and then the infighting begins
I'm Sorry The Royals In The Same League As The Sopranos Made Me Laugh 😂😂😂Prince William And Lifeless Puppet Wife Kate Will Never Be That Cool😂😂😂❤
They had protesters to this arrested as did Trudeau to peaceful protesters in Ottawa. take a look at some of their nefarious plans with Epstein in Virgin Islands and Africa. They are predatory parasites ! it makes me sick that people want to keep them around, if only they wake up and see the truth.
Funnily enough, my two favourite bands in the 90s were New Model Army and The Levellers.
Loathsome
The queens will was ridiculous when I heard of her heirs
The same everywhere
Eloquently put tottaly spot on sir,, thank you  Joe
Public pay your wages and you join the Amy nobody ask you to your are sick 2:28
I'm just surprised at the British people loving the monarch but have no idea why. They are completely useless. If this was France we would see a  revolution. There would be no monarchs left.
Go and live in France if you like it so much. Charles does work and will continue until he dies ( no choice in the matter) I know quite a few millionaires who grew up in council houses from humble beginnings & now have a better, freer lifestyle than all the Royals. This podcaster is one blinkered, bitter fuck.
Roundhead !!!!
Could not agree more!
They don't care as long as they keep it the way it is it's all good init.
Ren is an amazing artist who is questioning everything. There is a movement to bring the truth to light. We live in a ridiculous world where we have had the biggest transfer of wealth in human history. And the people just still sit there doing nothing. It is interesting that the only clue we have about the bank of england share holders was Edwards documentary where he actually admitted that William of Orange was a shareholder of the private central bank called the bank of england. It creates money out of thin air, gets us to pay it back by our hard earned money, and then charges interest on that money lent. Great job if you can get it. But it will keep most people in perpetual poverty. I agree with you. The world is run by gangsters. And it is time we stop this madness. Thanks for sharing.
Kings and Queens for Who ??  They are Not Bees ,,,Ants ,,, Wasps to be Pollinated and Guarded ,,,,,
Putting on medals , But has Never Fought Any War  ??? Awarded Medals for Nothing ???😄😅😆😂😃
What a hypocritical crap ex soldier, love them or hate them you signed TO SERVE THE MONARCH.......you are a disgrace to those who served and died in the service of Queen/King and country
You are sooo right. 👍👍👍
The greatest thieves of all are the multinational corporate companies that exploit workers and send the profits off shore.
It now needs Northern Ireland and the British Union to become a republic without its dysfunctional monarchy. Then, both Irelands and Britain will be at peace with each other and become peaceful trading partner nations without the continual interference of British law from the corrupt European Union. We are living in the year 2023, and good sense must prevail. Also a high rate of Vat on gold where the value of gold must return to US$35 for an ounce. Only then can the world currency return to what it was after the 1939-45 gold standard. I only hope good sense will prevail. John Eric Hoare. British, Australian, and Norwegian deep seaman 1956-2003, now retired.
The only problem with gettig rid of the monarchy is? The government takes on their wealth and power. We need a complete reform of both?  Civil war is needed
The BEST COMMENTARY EVER. THANK YOU LORD!!!
BTW:  The REAL KING lives in Australia I think
ATROCITIES  CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY  CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN  CRIMES WITHIN THEIR OWN BLOODY FAMILY!!! Killing MOTHERS FATHERS WIVES……..SACRIFICIALLY …….. AND THAT DOESN’T EVEN BEGIN TO DEFINE THE CENTURIES OF TORTURE AND EVIL CONDESCENSION TOWARD THE REST OF US!!! You are SO AMAZINGLY RIGHT!!!! But then,  if We HUNG THEM or the crowns,  we would have NO ONE LEFT  to fulfill Revelation!!!
i'm with you.
Get rid of all of them.....if Jimmy savile had still been alive he would of had a front row seat at the coronation
Everyone has their place in society whether they deserve their position good or bad or not. This is an earthly system one day we will see the true King of Kings and that will be the kingdom we will live in forever. This world is not our home we just passing through. Take heart Jesus is alive and He is King of Kings and Lord of Lords.  Be blessed 🙏
I have never liked those snakes!  Diana was the only good one and you see what they did to her!  What makes these royals better than anyone of us?!  No they are much worse!!🤮🤮🤮🤬🤬
Moron alert
God Bless Your courage  in speaking the TR UTH .WAKE UP WORLD .WE HAVE BEEN LIED TO .  SWAMP IS BEING  DRAINED .TURNAROUND .WAKE UP .IN JESUS NAME .AMEN
Yes He is making UK a non Christian country no more the beauty of yesterdays no more Christian values.
Joe, you absolutely correct but it applies to all so called royal institution. Why would anyone exalt and worship any other person is beyond my thinking. The only reason why these people are in these positions of privilege is because their forebears were the worst butchers and thieves which their offspring emulate to continue to hold on to power and privilege.
I can't say the obvious.  do research on the members of the world economic forum members...
Parasites
they are not allowed to breastfeed their children, but diana didn t care .
Charles is a criminal WEF agent.
Let me cut through the felgercarb to the actual root of this entire planet's problem.  Liberals wreck everything they touch, particularly today, with their absurd collectivism, the multicultural, class warfare, welfare state, ecological hysteria, unworkable green living drivel, anti-Semitism, 51 transgender genders and all of it driven by a one party media, one party elites, all wasting astronomical amounts of money that makes King Charles' wealth look like a luncheon bill.  We get the world we allow.  If I didn't believe in Jesus, I'd want to permanently leave this universe.
ARABIA IS UNDER BRITISH OCCUPATION AND SAUDI PUPPETS AND PERVERTS!
STOP INSULTING OUR KING! LOMG LIVE THE KING EVEN IF THE ROYALS MURDERED DIANA FOR HIM TO MARRY HIS MISTRESS!!! BAFS
Problem is the ignorance of the people.The monarch stand in LAW which is above all acts and statutes, which is there for OUR ADVANTAGE.People need to educate themselves and stop moaning. Don’t go to war, don’t exercise your legal fiction. Everyone is brainwashed by materialism. There are many remedies. MAGNA carta still stands so does the bills of exchange. It’s down to the people. Use their system to your advantage. WE DONT WRESTLE AGAINT FLESH AND BLOOD. Reflect on the advantage to having a monarchy, moan all you want, we would be stuffed without one. This doesn’t mean I stand for what they are about. Not one bit of educational advice was given here
Reading Harry's Book upset me .William paying 14 grand to get birds brought in so he and his mates could have a shooting weekend. I found that book shocking
That pistols tune made it to number one,so they played joe dolce,shaddap y. Face instead.
Long live King Charles !!!!!!!!
🇺🇸 May I say that what we have now in government now is no different. They are supposed to be for the people, by the people and that is ALL GONE. Pray people Pray. We the people are in this together.  No matter what country we are from. 🙏
Charles the Woke hates the British race , he is the Architect of the Foreign invasion,  mongrelization of the White race .
Well said, all malfeasance legal ⚖ that is not lawful,  and can be sued,  That is the Law ⚖ There are only 2 categories in Law  1st man woman living human within the law,  2nd nonliving nonhuman stands under legal ⚖ Rule is legal as and law both must follow the law lawfully or is illegal nullified automatically by the law that is the Law, and people must be prosecuted within a lawful timeline by the lawful law of the people 3 judges 12 jury that know the lawful law ⚖ if legal or law ⚖ is not lawful it is malfeasance that from the 13th century and still today is life imprisonment 👿 For the nonliving person who is role playing in costume for legal nonliving corporations creators of unlawful documents Regulations, Acts, bills, legislation, Royal accent, law, not limit to,     8:32 the new World 🗺 sign for freedom google it  and imo
If the Monarchy goes, it may well be a good wake up call for the UK people. The worst tyranny though is the one in Washington.
True enough royals are defunct hidden oppressors of the world via international banking which they own .ive seen the contract from king james giving control of America  and Canada to the new london land company on his behalf .I did not see any recinding of that contract !!! The king owns large parts of the earth still
Cause asking for a 19% pay rise is a little pay rise.
Their days are numbered!
There is Stockholm syndrome and then there is monarchal syndrome.
A supreme waste of money
They are inbred families and always keeping their blood and fortune in own people with the power of money and lands they owning 😮
Disgracefull
Please be careful yourself. Some one might vanish you by car accident like happens to Diana 😅 new king would kill if in need 😢
Jolly Prince Randy/Andy Andrew: typcial royal. They should be deported.
I totally agree with everything you say.  I don't understand this feudal, slavish attitude so many people have towards these greedy, self-centred and totally horrible people.  I hate them and the super-rich who are all a part of their club, it seems.  The lives of the ordinsry working - and middle - classes don't mean anything to those leeches.  I want them gone asap.
"Neo-phrataigeach" means the following:  1. impractical 2. unrealistic    ⛔
Thé royals bring us nothing
Not my king
Well said. Absolutely nailed it.
Jimmy Savilles best buddy.....
Very interesting video
Better to have them, than a dictatorship
When England, Scotland, Canada, and Australia become republics, they will be true allies of the US.
The absurdity is that people who have nothing, revere this clan of tax-dodging scumbags! In my opinion, Charles should be the last of his kind. Speak up against this disgusting institution; demonstrate and don't defer to them. The royals are sewn into the fabric by the anthem alone. It doesn't speak about the country or its people, it's designed to have you follow the monarch blindly because national pride and support for the monarch go hand in hand, every time it is played at every national event. We are forced, in the midst of our nation's pride to worship these morons. Are the UK and its people mentioned in the words? NO. Then it is not about our nation. It's brainwashing. Change the anthem and people will start to think differently about this country.
Willian will be a great king and our late queen was lovely
The revolution will not be televised.
Charles is officially the most inbred royal in history, his mother and father, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip were both 3rd and 2nd cousins (oh yes they were!); Phillips's grandfather, King George of Greece was Princess Alexandra's brother, and she was married to Edward VII (Charles' great grandfather) and Alexandra is the great Grandmother to Queen Elizabeth II, making her and Phillip 2nd cousins - and Charles is also a secret cousin of Camilla through his great-grandfather, King Edward VII, who secretly sired one of Camilla's grandfathers. Prince Phillip's mother was a product of first cousins; her grandfathers were brothers. Prince Phillip's great-grandmother, Alice was the sister of Queen Elizabeth II's great grandfather King Edward VII, he was was great-grandfather of Charles. making them 3rd cousins. King Edward VII's parents, Victoria and Albert were 1st cousins. We wonder why they are nuts? Their inbreeding generates strange behaviour and that is the real reason they marry a commoner every now and again. If they didn't we'd see some really obvious mental and physical deformities. If Queen Elizabeth hadn't been one of the least inbred royals, it would be much, much worse. Prince Charles' consanguinity coefficient (all inbreeding taken into consideration) is 13%. When two full siblings have a child, theirs is 25%. It makes him the most inbred royal of all time in the UK. Only one, Phillip, supersedes him and he's Spanish. Kate and Diana were introduced into the gene pool to lessen the effect. The royal family are an immoral institution, built on paedophilia, incest, adultery and murder. We keep them in the lap of luxury and for what exactly?? They interbreed and behave like the most dysfunctional family imaginable and this makes them worthy of us making them Millionaires and billionaires? If foreigners didn't make such a big deal out of this unconscionable family, we wouldn't need them. This country needs to wake up!
Ahhh so refreshing to hear truth. A few months ago in Ireland my father said there's a book upstairs you might be intrested in reading.  First few sentances..Alas the world in run by criminals and gangsters😢.Times are a changing.Nice video Sir
If you are a former soldier like my parents why did you join the British knowing full well you have to swear an oath of allegiance. If you don't swear the oath allegiance join another army.
This is so horrible on so many levels and he should not be King....I believe something happened to the Queen and she died before her time?  Princess Diana raised her boys right and I think the tables will turn.
The Monarchy is a Government ( cult ) the Monarch is ruled by them!!!!
Chuckky is the king of a rock in the ocean smaller than the Kruger national park, in South Africa. It's crazy how such a small country did what they did to everyone else over time.
Extremely well said. 🙏🏼
Do not judged, or you will be judged accordingly 😢
Get rid of these parasites they have conned the poor peasants for hundreds of years
VIVA LA REVOLUTION
LOL... get a proper job? He's got a proper job. He's an arms dealer !
Truth is light  We see through it  Love your work ❤
Look how many German businesses the Royal family had investments with to support the German war machine even during the holocaust, the crown prince's of Europe feared a bolshevic style revolution so they strengthened the socialist party Hitler was building, they really opitomise hypocrisy.
Work confidentiality broken
The Royal family are not existent for traditional purposes. I don't care what the public within the UK or the Commonwealth are brainwashed to believe. They are literally the head of State. It's time to get with the 21st century. Not only that, all Commonwealth countries must get to the point of declaring themselves constitutional republics. Then if the Royal's should wish to stick around, THEN they can proclaim that they exist for "traditional" purposes, but only until then. And let's face it, the monarchy is religion. It's time for a true separation of church and State. The only way for the people of the UK to do so is to vote in a law making the UK a secular State. These constitutional powers already exist within the UK if the government wished to do so. That's the only modern way of ending the monarchy. You gotta get rid of the church, folks. Time to grow up. Either rule yourselves or be ruled.   The only citizens that should be free from paying any taxes are those who have served a particular period of time as an active duty soldier.
Would be amazing if the British people wised up to these mugs like this man has....
Mi5 terrorised me for talking like this. Remote neural monitoring/voice 2 skull the whole nine yards. If you call them out becareful they dont call you out. I admire your dont give a shit attitude.👍
WELL SAID!!!!!
Bitter, bitter little man.
It’s NOT the “Royals” who have robbed out the Treasury, given trillions of pounds in Tax Write-Offs to the rich and Super Rich. Who have pushed up the UK National Debt to 98% of GDP, from only 10% of GDP under the last Labour Government.   It’s NOT the “Royals” who have driven millions of British people into abject poverty, and created a satiation when there are MORE Food Banks in the UK, that there are McDonald’s burger shops – over 1,300 Food Banks.    It’s NOT the “Royals” who have garden parties, where they boast about transferring money form poor and deprived communities, to wealthy communities like Rishi Sunak does.   It’s NOT the “Royals” who have cut Public Services by over 60%, frozen Public Sector Pay for over 10 years. Cut the number of Medical Students, and made it unnecessarily difficult for student to get a University education.   It’s NOT the “Royals” who have forced unnecessary “austerity” on the British people so they can give Tax Cuts and Tax Write-Offs to the rich and Super Rich.   It’s NOT the “Royals” who have driven the country to bankruptcy, and the British population to despair and desperation.   It’s NOT the “Royals” who have ANY of these things!   IT’S THE TORIES!!    It’s the CONSERVATIVE PARTY who have done all of these thing!!   IT IS THOSE C#NTS WHO WE HAVE GOT TO BE RID OF!!   Fire your shots at the right target.
A powerful message ..
Brilliant ❗
When was a young girl saw the Queen, Prince & Dianna. Lady Di was the only light the 👿 oozed from other two. We’re censored here I’m sure you know why they’d come to 🇨🇦just horrible
As a Yank, I don't feel I have any right to throw in my 2 cents of an opinion here.  I simply hope you British folks work this out in a way that is most beneficial to the most people in your great country...........
Tom McDonald is a independent singer and has no problem to tell the truth we now live.
Yep when inbred folk who can trace their bloodlines for centuries ( enable a chain of unbroken healing) aren't here to deal with edema collectively I'd think there'd be tons more pulmonary thromboli
And the Windsors killed Diana.
Sounds a bit jealous to me
let''s not forget Charles hung tight with peddo Jimmy Saville.
He wont last long
FANTASTIC/GREAT VIDEO!  I have never thought of the UK Monarchy and only tuned in the other week to see what this was all about.  I saw Gold Carriages being paraded around in front of the world, those who are struggling for food, jobs and a future.  Either the Monarchy are stupid and live in a bubble that cannot see that showing wealth, created off the backs of the local population, will cause troubles OR they don't care and welcome the coming push back, so they can stand up and STOMP DOWN the population, which could/would cause other country leaders to do the same.  There has been a change in leadership and management of countries and feel all world leaders are close to "starting over", why else would a massively old man who runs 1/4 of the world's population parade more wealth then God in front of the starving and less privileged masses, unless they want to "start" something....whoa.
The wind is not even English there are a German family they change their name to Windsor to sound more English we all know their real blood name Patient of king George the 5th replacing the historic name of sax Sax Colbert goutha That is the real name of the German kings of England
King for a day, fool for a lifetime.
Incest - The game the whole family can play
Multiple religions is not Christianity, it is satanism.  See John 14:6
Yes! I absolutely agree with this fine British soldier. The royals have been drinking at the trough of public monies for long enough. In reality they generate nothing of significance to improve the lives of those really in need. If they wish to perpetuate the myth of ' serving the people' they can do so at their own expense. God Save The People Amen.
Hot!
Absolute star this guy , light bless him spitting real truth.
As an American I can never understand how you British people bow down to a king and a queen...  If my president was a piece of s*** and standing in front of me he would be told that your queen and king have you guys scared ..  As they don't let you even have guns to protect yourselves from them
Correction George Galloway is a noble exception in the UK
How refreshing!!! I'll be back...you should stand for Parliament...there is no intelligent voice fighting for working people anymore, in the neo-lib/con House of Commons...they have their own elite obsessions, completely divorced from the needs and aspirations of ordinary people and they're served by a woke warmonger media that doesn't give a damn.
Is this nothing more than a controlled opposition piece? What is said is only partially correct. The behaviour of the elites goes way deeper and way more sinister than what will ever be spoken about.  I’m seeing a lot of hand symbols from the narrator…as to the hidden message I have not got a clue but it doesn’t seem normal or relative the words which are spoken?
That's what the last couple generations don't understand, we have been reading about this for years. I was afraid to look at them,  Until Precious Diana came, she changed the look of them, but not them 😢😮
Yes you are so right, i don't understand it either, half the land and Jewels they have, so many people were murder & slattered ,and to this day we the people still pay royalties for land that was stolen, awwww. We don't want them anymore, they are useless 😮
Although I respect your opinion , I have to totally disagree, but your insight was interesting. Peace my friend
I agree! They are nothing more than the most successful gangsters!  Nothing more! Just another family of intitled psychopaths!
Chomsky said the power is always in the hands of the controlled, they just don’t realise it. And the best trick the elite play is to divide and distract to make sure it stays that way #speaktruthtoppwer
Yep all a bunch of crooks who live off the poor.
We're not in the  Victorian era anymore. The royal family should be abolished. Get in with the changing of times.
YAY & THANK YOU FOR YOUR BRAVERY AND TRUTH!  IT'S TRULY DEMONIC AND IT WILL END.  THINGS ARE GETTING WAY, WAY WORSE!  THEY ARE IN NO WAY ABOVE ANYONE ELSE--THEY ARE JUST PEOPLE.  THEY DON’T DESERVE THE SICKENING LAVISH LIVES THEY LEAD AND ALL OF THE PROPERTIES THEY OWN ARE OUTLANDISH; THEY ARE UNNECESSARY, AND UNBELIEVABLY EXCESSSIVE.   THE MONARCHY SHOULD BE DISBANDED/ELIMINATED AS AN INSTITUTION BY THE BRITISH PEOPLE AND THE U. K. GOVERNMENT.  FOR ANY TRUE BELIEVERS IN JESUS CHRIST . . . JESUS IS COMING SOON AND ALL OF THESE MONSTERS/VILLIANS/THEIVES WILL BE IN GOD'S HANDS . . . THEY CAN HAVE THEIR WEALTH, ARROGANCE, AND SATAN BECAUSE THAT IS WHO IS BEHIND EVERYTHING SINISTER HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.  I PRAY FOR PEOPLE TO OPEN A BIBLE AND READ . . . IT’S TRUTH; THE ONLY TRUTH IN THIS LIFE AND IN THIS WORLD.  AS ANGERING AS IT IS . . . WE NEED TO LEAVE THEM TO GOD . . . 🙏😘🙏
I find it hard to define a flavour patriotism that I would enjoy.  This video goes a long way towards that goal.  Chiefly the desire to see all your countryman made equal.  The desire to remove from power all those who stand against this and lastly the desire to walk the vast and  beautiful countryside that has been locked away from us for untold years by the biggest land owner in this country.
You're right they are gangsters they took by force. They need to brought to justice.
I would go after the children the royals have killed look in Canada where the queen and her stolen native Indians from and orphanage you have to ask what happen to there.
Get rid of the royal monarchy which is just a farce. Taxpayers paying taxes for all their holidays excetera. This is not a time for a king who has his beautiful wife murdered
Wow! Awesome, you are a legend, a star soldier, best of British
You make great sense.... citizens go along with this brainwashing that these are Royalty
The Royals are elevated Free Masons, thats all they are, all Luciferians.
I say having royalty is outdated.
Great content 🙌📹😁🍀
Can't  stand Charles...Camilla....Queen ?! Disgusting !!!
The Royals have always had high ranking positions over various regiments etc. The Queen and now King is the ultimate authority, on paper, over all the forces. You have to swear an oath to that respect when you join the forces. Dont like that? Then don't join up.
& dont forget this country has had many financial disasters throughout history & none of these people or their relatives have ever lost anything, unlike us that lose everything including relatives & this coming financial crash they wont lose a thing & we will i swear this is all by design by them, WAKE UP WISE UP RISE UP ✌🙏
He should return our diamond to Africa
Oh, someone who looks to me, showing signs of a bang on the head!  Good job he wasn't born in the US, as he'd far more to bang on about how it is now, but would have plenty of conspiracy theorist friends to gain. Maybe he looks the other way and prefer to be in Russia?  As much as this country is not the best, I count myself lucky to be born here. I'm less of a fan of the Royal family since Diana, but they are the key to our civilised structure and if a government really gets out of hand, Charles always has the option to call in the military. The government may give orders to the military as the norm, but the military will always answers to the crown, if a government seeks dictatorship.  That's why we have good stability!
I agree with you 100 per cent Joe. The Amount of Wealth that they own is OUTRAGEOUS ! While there so called Subjects are Struggling to keep a Roof over there heads, The homeless queuing on the streets for food and shelter, It Really Is Outrageous ! God Bless Harry, With the money his Beloved Mum left him and with Megan by his side he was able to get away from it all, and as for him feeling alone at his Dads Coronation I think he was So Brave to show up and leg it away from the as soon as it was over. Good Luck to him and his Family. He told the truth in his book and that was His Right . I am delighted that he got away from them. Piers Morgan among others have earned a Fortune running him down daily on You Tube, and the people have acted like Sheep agreeing with him. His jealousy of Harry is Outrageous.He ought to be ashamed of himself. Anyway Joe getting back to THE FIRM I think they should be put out of power by the people if Only They Will Take Heed Of You. Best Of Good Luck Joe XXXXX
Thanx for sharing with us, they've gangsters  in u k they are using the tax money for nothing, people need to wake up let them stay away from the tax money, they've not good
No one believes this s*** anymore with the higher ups and all their lives and their tentacles throughout the globe
i disagree purely for the sake of stability the longest lasting governments are monerch while republics are 2nd place stable government is key ask your self this who is willing to sacrifice for the betterment of the next generation
Charles is responsible for Lively Diane's life and death.
I no longer stand with the royals... I now stand with the people... ❤️
Ray Davies for King!
They're obviously a front for the Crown Corperation of London
There are bigger problems than a leaking pen
I’m not a fan of Charles but how is this exposing him as the title suggests,or do we need to read your book to find out more, and does an ex soldier really know more about this than the average man on the street? Everyone loves a dig at the Royals and I can see why but it’s much deeper than the Royals or politicians or presidents causing the world issues these people have little or no control on what happens,do your research people dig a little deeper you won’t find the answers but you may be surprised what you do find
This guy is spot on.
Tnx for giving us the straight facts🇿🇦
Bit uncomfortable with the pisstaking of his fingers when we sit on the left and frown at body shaming in general.  Bit hypocritical like...
I see your monarchy as an expensive mascot for Britain that can bite and withhold laws meant for the people regardless of parliament. A Spanish friend once told me. We are slaves to our pets. We feed them, bathe them, take them out for walks, and pick up their SHAT! same with any monarch and dictator.
THE THING CHARLES IS KING OF IS THE CRAP HOUSE OR IN CANADA WE CALL THE OUT HOUSE  WHERE WE TAKE A BIG CRAP  (  SHIT  )  LOL.......THERE DAYS ARE ENDING WE NO LONGER SUPORT THAT FAMILY WHO EONS AGO STOLE IT OUT RIGHT??>>>>>>
And would Andrew be on the Sarah's list
Now where would they park the Rolls at a Council house?
I agree 100 % of what he’s saying.
France has more tourists than Britain with no royal family.
My Gosh do you ever come up for air. Talk about verbal diarrhea. Have you ever done the maths? If so what would be available for the nation's coffers by abolishing the monarchy. and by the same token how much would be lost. What would be the process   used to bring about this change. Who would administer the change over.   May I ask what rank you held in the services
Couldn't agree more.  Vive la France!
MAGNA CHARTA RULES — Monarchy is a crutch with a whip.
HERE HERE.  as a human being when I saw him punch his polo pony in the side of the head I lost ANY respect I may have had  ??  All I know is — INTERNATIONAL OPIUM ADDICTION AND WAR.  THE MIDDLE PASSAGE SLAVE TRADE. THE SACK OF INDIA - CLIVE REMEMBER. THE SACK OF CHINA twice  but hey we all speak English now right ???  MONARCHIES???   for weak people who live in the past while waving the jesu$ flag in everyone’s face ???   Yes or no
Reptilian  He was walking with that black robe in his real shape People say it was a grim reaper but it was not it was KC
Windsor? I thought it was Batenburg.
Jamal Khashoggi R.I.P.
Thats the downfall of King Kong to marry and made his mistress to become Queen of Con!!!! He continued to instill the itch to the public mind “ Showing his arrogance, privilege, untouchable, the chosen one, powerful King” No trace of wrongdoing, exemptions to the rule of Law! Royal of Mafia!🙄🤮
I’d Romanov the f**king lot them
Perverse envy monologue.
Charles also opened the Satanic  Commonwealth Games in Birmingham UK.  A Large Bull with blood red eyes and SATANIC dances around it etc etc   The Jamaican Team refused to participate and walked off.
Time to abolish this vile corrupt institution once and for all. Very few want them but people are brainwashed by bbc, sky and you gov corrupt polls.
Something fundamentally wrong to pull this off in 21st century. Give them a chanel island to go about, like Monaco.  The crown done a lot harm to their own people. The best thing Charles could do, is a public apology for past crimes and then take it from there. If folks can forgive them, I don't know. Otherwise, resign. Either he's doing it or the job goes to Will.  Ruling monarchy has no future. He can get some AI Bots to chase about, if it makes him happy.
There is no such entity as royalty, they are merely thespian confidence tricksters utilised by our evil, secretive, manipulative Establishment in keeping the people servile to their whims, fancies and outrageous agenda. This has been the case since the English Civil War when one mafia replaced another. Our creator projects us unto this planet in equal measure and with the power to think for ourselves and formulate our lives here. The immoral and devious among us attempt to deceive us into believing they are ordained by god in their right to control us. They make the laws to suit their own purposes. Just remember, they were not given any right by god, whatsoever. The worldly Church went along with this purely for their own benefit and survival, many centuries back. I rest my case.
Good to hear the Putney Debates here ... England were on the cusp of writing their constitution and those ideas ended up in the American Constitution  Framing debates with English refugees fleeing Civil War..I am convinced it is why Layfeyette actually joined Washington ...to prevent those debates ever getting back into England by consigning them to intellectual property of Congress....protecting France from republic in England...which failed at any rate...The American Sovereignty Restoration Act currently going through Congress will release all that intellectual property again as English constitution arguments created federation which the states do not want...One man one vote is the English way ...one tyrant ,stuff the ballot boxes by any means necessary ..is the American way... Democracy is coming home !
The Queen's husband was never called KING just Prince Philip. Why has Camilla been dumped on us as Queen instead of "Queen Consort"! What happens if Charles dies before her, does that woman remain Queen! #NotMyKing #CamillaNeverMyQueen 😡
Hopefully the British people will rise up and end this greediness.
It's easy for a relative nobody who contributes little of significance to society to mock King Charles. I have respect for him because although he has weaknesses and has made mistakes, he has the strength of character and integrity to admit it and to do his duty for the nation. He doesn't do it begrudgingly but with humility, respect and a love for the people. Sure criticise the upper-class for producing  egotistical parasitic sociopaths such as Boris Johnson and Rees Mog, but Charles is a national treasure, and if we support his efforts to help make Britain a better place to live in, then we could reap the benefits.
Why? What's that inbred done this time? Did he say he wants to be one of those super absorbent with "wings"?
CANNOT WATCH THIS ROYAL GANGSTERS.
I agree.  From South Africa,  bring back the diamond
I work for NHS and I can see how staff is struggling with the bills and stuff . It’s disgusting they could spend 100M on a useless ceremony while real working class people are suffering.
I congratulate your point view 👌 I am from the most nastiest greediest and powerful Colony you Bloody Brit's every created. And things don't look too sweet here ether in the USA.
I stopped following these fools when I found out Charles was best friends with Jimmy Savile,  Nuff said.
I believe he is anti christ!
You didn't 'expose' anyone at all. All you did was waffle on about your own marxist view of the monarchy. Rubbish
Wow !!!!
Look at these disrespectful pricks talking about bringing down the monarchy in their own country get a life it won’t happen in your lifetime
Have you noticed Charles's face and hands? Well I have! And he's not long for for his role as king! I don't care what they say, but he is in really bad health. He is a ticking time bomb! I mean I'm just sayin it looks like to me that he has a a heart problem and bad diabetes! And from the way he walks it looks like he has gout in his feet! I mean I'm no doctor but I have been around the health care for years and I have seen so many people with a lot of the very same things. So if he dies what will happen to the throne?! Does the queen become the new leader or does William become king?!  Just wondering!
Not to mention their well documented crimes against children.
They have 6.6 billion acres of land ,1/6 of the world 36 billion usable land , education is the key
The common man has no teeth! Its ok having cause & being willing to sacrifice for the greater good; yet spades hoes & forks are no match against the elites dogs of war!
Ooooh YA SO RIGHT THERE JOE,I TIP MY HAT TO YOU.BEEN SAYING IT FOR MANY YEARS ROYALTY MONARCHY ARE THUGS THIEVES GLUTTONS SCUM FILTH ETC.BRITONS NEED TO RISE AND RID THEMSELVES OF PURE FILTH.
why is this jealous traitor talking and why are people listening. i can't stand these people who try to destroy Britain instead of just moving.
I literally said on the 6th and tomorrow all the scandals will come out. People will talk for the first time etc. someone could tell an awful story about any of us Im sure.
Double Down News And yet you worked for them by becoming a soldier!  You should be exposing the whole bloody lot. There is nothing to pick and choose from.
Turned off at "grubby little fingers". Happy to listen to a real argument. Nasty snarky crap ... no thanks "former British soldier" (why no name? Ashamed?)
You need to grow up and think again.
King Saul again?
Charles is a Narcissist plain and simple, it is "my way or the highway with him" i watched parts of the Coronation but only to see the Equerry Johnny Thompson,
Charlie boy mates with 33 degree mason Jimmy Savile . Say no more .
Do take care. Remember poor Diana
Lowest of the low,the literal product of incest!! Literal filthiest family on earth!!
Sorry. Those tfl train drivers are NOT on a pittance. They are on at least £65,000. Yes pounds. Is that a pittance?
I grew up in 4he 70s.I was smart enough to read between the lines. Question the " norm". My late mother a highly intelligent, extremely well read woman knew what was going on below the surface. The Vatican, the Royals. I don't follow any crowd.I think people are now past educating in general. The coronation proved this.At least question, just don't sit and be drip fed.
The idea of constitutional or veiled monarchy when compared to the display of sheer power when compared to raw powers of Middldeeasrern monarchs is probably true. It is extremely well concealed.
Abolish the monarchy. All humans are equal, no one is special or “royal.”
"King of kings" 😲
It must END..NO TIME FOR ROYALTY PEOPLE ARE POOR..NEXT DOOR.THEIR WEALTH IS MIND BOHLING
This is worth watching as another point to consider when thinking about getting rid of the monarchy. Not to say that we shouldn't. Rather what it's function should be and what would we replace it with if we deem it passed it's sale by date. Before we throw it way does anyone here actually  know what a constitutional monarchy means and what makes our constitution so important? https://youtu.be/hLBLEJYEsrU
This is interesting to hear, coming from a different angle & not the rose tinted one printed in the media from time  to time.
I agree and disagree. I dont like this royal family but i am pro monarchy. Its our history which the far left extremists want rid of so they can take full power in this country. Look at russia and how they killed the royals there. Also i dont believe in everyone is equal. This again is communist crap. Are you saying your the same standard as a paedophile? Is a shelf stacker the same standard as a brain surgeon? No some of us are better then others and being working class i dont have a problem with this. We need structure in life. We need something to aim for. In the days of extremists trying to undo structure to cause anarchy we need to be careful what we do as helping the extremists just makes us puppets
Time that royals are gone 🇬🇧🇬🇧
Charles is a huge supporter of the WEF......says it all.
I thought I was going to see some major expose' of Charles but all you have are the same old anti monarchy talking points. Click bait.
Charles has long been a globalist, a proponent of a One World Government.... a member of the WEF group.
Charles is a satanist.
Disgraceful ! You are a former soldier and you had pledged your allegiance to the Crown.  Traitor.
On pace. Continuity of unaccountable power.  Thank you for your service of soldiery. I subscribed.
Harry’s the only one who will land on his feet and thrive when the final accounts are audited
did anyone notice how embarrassed and uncomfortable poor Camilla looked when she was apparently compelled against her wishes to become Queen and wear that ridiculous crown ?
Think what you want of me, but I see him as the anti-christ. No one should be worshipping this man.
I'll give this one a nod, lad! More extreme extrapolation of poor people's money than most anywhere else.
Back in history kings were warriors and protectors  who led warriors.  They earned their positions.  This royal family of England  are now are privileged and  spoiled brats.
I love this.
I am an American “ now “ but my family snd my linage and all my family are from the collective UK ( but also free independent Ireland as well as Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland ( British ) and Northern French ( Britney ) and I can tell you those who sit on the thrown now got there by absolute treachery and betrayal and done the most diabolical series of plots ever conceived ! They are NOT the rightful Monarch’s of Britain ! And the present day “ new “ king is an absolute Globalist ( New World Order ) decibel ! He worships at the feet of the WEF and the elites that wish to crush all freedom ! Sadly my own family were literally driven off their land and died for challenging those who now sit and call themselves Windsor ( also not their real name ) ! So sir you are right they are indeed “ gangster “ snd some of the best in the business !
KC is one of the most evil humans on the planet.  Human might not be accurate.  More like.....lizard.
Bravo.   Amen.  🙏🙏🙏
Just from an American standpoint there is a fascination with the antiquarianism yet if there was any attempt to have such institutions devoted to quasi medieval pageantry outside of a purely religious context it would be considered ludicrous. In other words, we also have a number of monstrous Anglican cathedrals most notably St. John the Divine in New York and the National Cathedral in Washington where they host functions such as presidential funerals but if there was to be a recrudescence of such pomposity in a political setting it would be laughed out of town. So why then is it okay to have people prancing around in these ridiculous outfits being attended to by pageboys and so forth without everyone spontaneously bursting out laughing? So in other words indeed the English Civil War predated the American revolution but unfortunately it didn’t stick. And then ultimately the line the rebranded Windsors are descended from were imported from Hanover and were originally known as the Saxe Coburg-Gotha family, a name which George V had to change during the First World War for obvious reasons. And then people forget that George I had to learn to speak English after he got to England just as William the Conqueror was a sort of Frenchman who couldn’t speak Anglo-Saxon.
It needs to be said that a democracy, a true democracy is that at it’s core is the rule of the mob. The majority will trample the minority at many levels. I’m an American and it makes cringe when  politicians say “we must save our democracy”, the idiots don’t understand that America is a Constitutional Republic.
Jesus Christ is the only King I bow and pledge my allegiance to. I don't want anything to do with the deceitful earthly kingdom of man.
The one thing ive realised in England a lot of people want a elective head of state when literally that is similar to a monarch but just elective so why don't people drill this idea into there brains why don't we have a elective monarchy and vote for a king or queen that belongs to the same family and I say GOD SAVE THE KING
100 million pounds just to put a crown on that man's head. 100 million pounds for that. And how much a lot of Brits are struggling in the midst of that, it's really a puncture to society. As many struggle to pay their bills, they're watching one of the most richest men in the world get crowned by the finest jewels, wearing the most finest fabrics, while having sheer luxury passed down to him from lineage, while some can't get enough of the new money with his face on it.
The reason the arts doesn't mock the monarchy anymore is because they want to receive honors. They want MBE or OBE after their name or even a knight or damehood.
Nailed it.
I've been a republican since 2008
Never understood this monarchy thing. Which sane person thinks a person deserves to be - Head of State, King, Emperor with all the power and wealth that comes with it - purely cause they are born. Hows such a dumb system been allowed to exist for such a long time and persists to this day is beyond me 😢
As an American I agree with you 100% The problem will be that any centralized government will 100% become corrupt no matter how good the intentions start out to be using ours for example in which you will be just trading one organized Mafia for another. We fought a war for freedom from tyranny set up a Republic and then destroyed any chance of it remaining by the people for the people by putting in a Federal Government with two political parties ending up on the same team with different sponsors aka lobbyists who are then totally owned by big tech and big Pharma amassing so much power/wealth, tearing up our Constitution and evolving into a Cartel of morally bankrupted thieves and worse. As long as any nation gives the power of its people over to a government of politicians/Monarchs, human nature dictates that will they will become corrupted in which the poor will remain poor and those in power will remain wealthy.
They need to work all royals
78yr old American.  Scottish,  Irish  heritage.  I have  no use for these scumm. Brits are all still living under serfdom slavery.
Let them eat bugs, the new royal response to hunger of the masses.
Would you pledge your allegiance to Jimmy Savile's mate? ABSOLUTELY NO WAY!!!!!
Nice words mate. Now subscribed 🤟
We need our own Robespierre that says enough is enough without taking advantage of the dismantling of the monarchy to kill all his political opponents
The country is f.. ked with or without the monarchy
I don't see why they are still around. With the British government, the British people don't need the monarchy. Your taxes are going to give them a lavish lifestyle. While the British people do without. I'm sorry. I know America is messed up. Kings and queens have no place in modern times.
Charles and Jimmy Saville. Andrew and Epstein. Notice a pattern?
Who does he work now the harkles  go away
I would hate to be this mans enemy or his ex wife going against him in divorce court sheesh!
Leftist propaganda!
Not to mention the Royal family was best mate was Jimmy Savile. Doesn’t that raise alarm bells in itself??
Off with his head!
Why should they fall.  They are royals for christ sake  Blue bloods baby   The Royals are cool man  Esp Prince George  Make him KING NOW
Go back in time and live under Stalin.....IMF
true. arrest the anti-christ!
This is Why America was Founded… and fought for our freedoms! People Forget this…
Tim Cohen wrote a book called Antichrist and a Cup of Tea. Hes got many videos on YouTube. His first book by same name in the 1980s . I must say his research is compelling, but King Charles is appointed head of King Davids line. It has a lot to do with the coat of arms. Evil tyrants have come from England.
Brilliant description by Joe of the Power System in the U.K. -- absolutely stunning presentation!!!
✅✅😊🐝
Imagine being told, that your money has to go towards a bunch of unemployed inbreds, who were close friends of Jimmy Savile.
I can't believe that the House of Lords still exists. Unelected legislators? That's insanity!
Sad to see a soldier being traitor.
I salute you for your electrifying power…
The worst of English gangsterism goes back to 1066 and hasn’t stopped since. A recent study revealed that there is a vastly disproportionate amount of money concentrated in those families whose names originated with the Norman conquest - starting with Grosvenor.
Armies do the dirty work of politicians and princes.
Fair play and exactly right, the monarchy perpetuates the right to stay rich now they adopt other gansters to donate funds to keep them afloat I just dont understand why you keep these people in such esteem
King is Dead...Been Dead
You top tier wanker
The sinister mass manipulators ie, the WEF at the bottom of the cycle have infiltrated leaders worldwide and will rise to the surface in full glare and some folks will still be blinded, through years of brainwashing. The elite and those drunk on power, including the Royals (whom are also at the bottom) can only lie and hide behind the veil for so long before the tide eventually turns. History repeats itself and what goes around comes around.
Head of statekeir starmeir poloticians are worsr
Toyal family have a proud history prince harry and william ffs clueless bitter man
Thanks
I don’t like Charles and Camilla for what they did to Diana. 🇦🇺🌟
They can keep their titles and a nice old house or two as far as I'm concerned. What is so offensive is the access to government, the tax dodging, the dirty dealing with the Saudis and others, the protection of Andrew and so on and so on. Reduce the position of King to basically a Lord Mayor with a sash and some actually work to do
Not the coronation chicken 😂
This is the most incoherent argument I’ve heard on either side.
I really like your content carry on my friend
They're a joke m8 Andrew the sex offender was in the navy and went to the Falklands in 1982 then he was secretly shipped back to safety he never saw any combats wtf is going on it makes me so upset and angry that im welling up with rage and anger.
WTF do the general public need to listen to this man and finally get rid of these free loading bastards
Well  said totally agree !!!!!!!
David icke exposed these pepole years ago drugs murder pedophiler ,jimmy Saville deep in royal family
I urge anyone who is reading this comment to purchase a book called. "Monsters inside the Palace." Then show It to anyone who is willing to read it. A bunch of wronguns.
You're a nut.
if the money they spent on supporting the Royal Family use to help the People in need. This world will be at better stage
great video..thanks so much for it.
The queen went against the Nuremberg code... the queen is not souvren to the people or the monarchy... she has disrespected the soldiers that died in WW1 WW2.. for souventry./ Freedom.. the Windsor's are not fit for the office 😢..
Royal satan worshippers,THEIVES stole your children,gold,and mining rights,land ,jewels ect,,,
Showing off their wealth
Charles who?? this looked like Charlie 2.0. And what was the coronation?? A load of dribble, where so many protocols were not followed. So I think Chucky is a goner!! As for the lizard, well thank you God. Liz and Phil did so much damage to children. This is well known. And it is said that Charles is the king of child trafficking. He is the Rothschilds bitch! Charlies wants the new world order. I pray this whole system comes down asap.
I honestly don't know exactly what it was but when I saw king Charles and queen Camilla on the balcony wearing the crown.they looked seriously odd I had to do a form of double take because to me I genuinely thought I was watching a episode of spitting image they really looked cartoon like to me it was weird! Positivity peace and love ♥️
Hello!  First time seeing you EVER!!!  SO glad I found this today!  As an American woman growing up (im GenX)  in Los Angeles, I always saw the royal fam as a fairy tale; of course, I only saw what they wanted the world to see, but it was so beautiful .  Esp during the golden era in the 80s, ~ the  timeframe of Diana & Charles ~ you are the first Brit that has has ever said it ever so eloquently, yet so brutally honest, quite truthfully.  Your transparency and candor is greatly appreciated!  Mad respect, you’re doing great!  Thanks for all that you put into this on the daily!  💯🔥💪🏼🏹
Pesky Blinders! That’s a stretch! 😂😂😂
Just as King Charles, Biden, Trudeau, the pm of Australia, EU and on and on are all in direct alliance with the global entity which is aggressively pursuing the forced creation onto humanity of a one world government and one world currency by way of total global collapse. King Charles needs to be executed for crimes against humanity along with Biden, Trudeau and the countless others.
God please protect ua all,and send your Son Jesus to take us out of this planet
The Windsor's original genealogy is from Germany, not even British
There is a strong republican tradition in Scotland. Of the 16, 000 recorded street parties that took place to mark the above event, a TOTAL of 14 took place in Scotland! Think about that for a minute! 14 out of a total of 16, 000! That's less than 0.09%! The fact we held an independence demonstration in Glasgow on the same day, which attracted 25, 000 participants, shows you just what Scotland thinks of the monarchy! So perhaps WHEN (NOT IF!) Scotland gains its independence, and inevitably votes for an elected head of state, England can follow our example!
There's one major problem with elections, democracy etc.  The only choice you get is which politician gets to tell you what to do.  Just, for a change, hire people that actually know what they are doing.
Anyone know what film featuring Colonel Rainsborough is used in this video?
Get to the f... point 😡😡😡
As Ben Frank said here is your Republic Madam if you can keep it.  I have faith in the people of the world with God's help will clean house.
King? *KING!?!* Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
👏👏
People are so poorer in the UK now. They are pre-occupied with feeding their families and keeping a roof over their heads with rents, food and energy so high. They have no time to think.  Even if you have covid-19 they are told to go to work. It’s terrible. I see it every single day.

I don't believe in bowing to or curtsying to ANYONE, I don't care who or what they are. We are all human.
So what's the problem with Prince Harry saying his truth about his family. When clearly stating that their is truth to what Harry speaks of.🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
The French revolution was basically industrial level murder and theft.
The World is a stage
The day a empire takes it's first breath it starts the Domino effect of destruction of its self. Where their is a begining there is also a ending. What goes up must come down.
Yep I think all royal should go why should tax payers pull out for them can't see Charles spending any of his millions of pounds his mother left him the royal family are just hanger on there are just shameless
👍
Diana.
You are a numpty for joining the Army. The Army was never about allegiance, it was about 4:21  comradeship, friendship and trust between friends. You obviously never understood that. You are entitled to your opinions, but I would never trust you. Mr Prince Harry
Brit’s In Luv With Having Green Blooded Psychopaths Lizards 🦎 Ruining Their Lives And Elsewhere.. Leaping Lizards 🦎 Good Gaw 😅

Charles bad news..head of Free Masons.
As a black person, I'm just stunned to have seen and listened to well educated Brits whose roots are clearly in the West Indies or Africa speak in favour of this well past its sell-by-date organisation with its roots unapologetically steeped in the Slave Trade. One black historian on TV even giving reason for why the monarchy should remain. I could only but shake my head. The next day I happened across an interview with well known royal correspondent Penny Junor who she herself had to admit the procession of the crowning was "a bit archaic" and needed "to be modernised". I'm not a republican per se but it does sour the saliva somewhat when we hear of nurses, teachers  having to resort to food banks to eat. A huge, crying shame in what is fast becoming a modern-day Victorian era. Time to get off your knees people, toss that Stockholm Syndrome membership card and step into the light of the 21st Century.
This clown Charels bows to Soros, Schwab, WEF, Rothschild ... a parasite, a puppet ... with all the money he has, his and Cawmila's coronation was paid for by those who barely have enough for themselves to survive (and hungry children). Shame!
The royals murdered princess Diana
He spoke the truth
Total truth bomb.
There are good traditions and not so good traditions. One tradition worth keeping is the Monarchy. There are many reasons, but here is one for you to think about. Did you know the Nazis came to power through democratic elections? The Nazis won the largest number of seats and Hitler became Chancellor through a coalition. However after a fire in the Reichstag Hitler was able to persuade the President to pass first of all a decree suspending civil liberties, which allowed Hitler to ban the communist party, his chief opposition. Then he later persuaded Hindenburg (the President) to pass the Enabling Act, which effectively suspended the German constitution and allowed to rule without passing legislation by the Reichstag.  It occurred to me then, that this could not have happened in Britain. With the possible exception of Edward VIII, I cannot see any of the British monarchs (of the 20th and 21st centuries) agreeing to sign off on any law or decree that would have allowed a British PM to have overturn the British constitution and rule in an authoritarian way. In my view monarchy is an essential part of the British constitution that is a bulwark against authoritarianism.
On Thursday night, at the glitzy Casa Cipriani in Manhattan, New York, Enninful hosted The Prince’s Trust Global Gala, which raised more than $1.7million for charity and their work in supporting young people. Prince Charles has do far helped over a million young people in need to get on in life. In Africa and countries like Cambodia.
You are one sick individual. They work for us !!! Stupid. Stupid. Ignorant man😱  The inauguration of a Head of State is a costly affair whether that Head of State be the President of a Republic or a Monarch of a Kingdom. ALL such ceremonies and celebrations are State occasions and paid for by the Government of each country. For the inauguration of a US President, the cost is anywhere between US$100m to US$200m or £80m to £160m and that cost is repeated EVERY 4 years. So, using the reign of our beloved late Queen Elizabeth I of 70 years, the cost to the US taxpayers for 18 Inaugurations would have been '''US$1.8 billion to US$3.66 billion or £1.44 billion to £2.88 billion. Economic increased activity to the USA due to a Presidential inauguration ... next to nothing over the same 70 years. For the Coronation of King Charles Ill of the United Kingdom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland, the cost is projected to be £100m. The projected INCOME from just the Coronation itself will be an extra £1 billion
PS: please do not use the word Windsor. It is a fake name that means nothing. I believe their real name is Gotha Saxon. Please correct me.
As I understand it, the real King of England is a farmer down in Australia. His father was murdered by MI-6 when it got on television and dumb asses kind of woke up, Woke.
This 'service' myth seems to be a mantra with them. Their kind of service I could well do without.
Fair comment
Costumes so sad !!!
Spot on if only majority of the idiots could see this, they are nothing but thieves.
Cheer up mate.
The former queen , real title , the queen of pirates , was pure evil .
Yes, but their are inherent problems with electing a head of state too. Look how corrupt the entire electoral system is, both here and in America.
I am not against monarchy.  I just think that the Royal family should be like the Scandinavian royals. Monarchy keeps a country united - in republics politics divide. What I do think is that there should be a law that states: no person, no matter who, is allowed to possess more than 1000 hectares of land in the UK and its overseas territories. This would mean that most duchies and the royal family would have to sell off most of their land. EVERY one should be allowed to own his/her own house. Paying a leasehold is criminal. All houses should be freehold.
Yes yes all true, not there is to much hypocrisy from Brits and ungratefulness. Sure this royals are tyrannical through history but they forget the British Empire and all of its people rips from all the benefits from everything they conquered.  So what are you going to do despose of the monarch take the land give it to the people and reparation to all the people on the realm. Yeah i highly doubt it.
Listen to: -Discharge -Napalm Death -Extreme Noise Terror
I have more royal in my shit then them people do
Truth
Charles is Evil
" Thou Shall Not spread any malice against the leader of your people. "
The royal family should be dismantled. We working people pay our hard-earned taxes to fund their pampered lifestyle. There are working people that can only afford shared property to reside in and the people that save lives for a living are striking and walking out of the career because the government don't give them enough to afford the cost of living. That being said, imagine how much better spent more of our tax money could be.
UNFORTUNATELY  Charles is IGNORANT when it comes to WEF, Bilderberg, The Great Reset, Chrislam, etc. etc. HOPEFULLY William will look into it and find out how dangerous these institutions are for a People and a Nation❗
Mate it’s the real mental health when people believe they have been chosen by GOD himself and we the people are very weak wake up my people!
Excellent video,  cheers from the US. Inbred morons is exactly what royals are.
There  Is More Info -  Coming  Forward  About  , Charles  As , To What He  Did To Get The Crown 💂🏻‍♀️👸🏿 ….!”
I am so sorry but I don’t know your name! But I just want to congratulate you on your brilliant video and more so on your exposure of the British monarchy for what it is! In my book anyone who lives off another without any pay back is a low down leech, that said the entire royal family are a bunch of leeches! Px
I’ve never heard of such tripe !! For an ex soldier you should be ashamed🫡
Abolish the monarchy. Strip them of their titles; no more HM, HRH, etc. Give the remaining members of the royal family a MODEST pension and let all of them move to Kensington where they can live out their remaining years. Turn the palaces into museums and historic parks for all to visit. Those museums and parks must be funded by entrance fees and private donations, not taxes.
In Canada 90% of the land is crown land. It’s education. We were not taught to think critically.
Everybody gives the example of the French but it was us who taught the French what you do with a king that believes in absolute Power it was us the executed a king way before it even occurred to the French the only difference is they committed genocide of the whole aristocrat and Ruling Class which is something that the English English could not do but it was us who gave the the world that idea first
Honoury "colonel in chief "of the parachute regiment,the tosser has never even jumped of a sofa !!!!! Diplomatic bags full of millions in cash,just the tip of the iceberg  ! Rotten to the corp and to see millions od ppl kiss his arse at the coronation, if only they would open their eyes !!!
I don't understand what your problem is. The royal family has no ruling or any real political power. Blame your stupid, corrupt government for the UK's downward spiral into poverty and misery. Perhaps if King Charles was given ruling and political power, the UK would be the greatest country on earth. King Charles is a brilliant thinker, a well-educated and well-spoken intellectual. Above all he is kind and fair to all - all religions and ethnicities. You guys are very LUCKY to have him and should be proud. I have no horse in this race as I'm from Jordan. But, facts are facts! I'm sorry, but you come across as extremely jealous and bitter. It's a big relief YOU are not the King.
'military cosplay' great phrase. Where are the artists who will ridicule power? I dont know about artists, but Private Eye is still doing it.
Diana was used like a brood mare and would probably still be alive today if she hadn't been coerced and hoodwinked into marriage. This family have enough money......they DO NOT need ours.
Well said man, well said.
Rubbish!! Top to Bottom!!
I agree with everything this man said 100%  Britain doesn't need a monarchy that shit is DEAD how they are allowed to go around calling themselves "Royalty" in this day and age is beyond me, bunch of rich aristocratic swines
They.are.thieves..robbers.and.decended.from.the.Germans.and.Russians.I.hate.them..
They bring in billions to the British economy every year. They work 14 hours a day. You may have your opinions about that they inherit their titles. But when you start lying that they cost Britain money, then you have misunderstood the whole British economy and why your biggest sector is touruism. The rest of your speech is just revolutionary communistic desinformation.
Treason I say. To the Tower with him!
Stockholm Syndrome rocks
Superb video!  Thank you very much!
In America we have a saying. If you don't like the country you live in then move to another. JMO. ...GOD SAVE THE KING!
Very Good Speech
The Royals did not get this wealthy by being honest. They are criminals and murders an get away with it. Prince Andrew is a child molester.
I do agree with you there, medals.  Men who have served and EARNED their medals when the Royals prance around in their plastic ones.  Biggest criminal in this in my mind is Hawwy.
who cares if you British soldiers, I don't do anything yet my head already been knock, true they so wild....
Has anyone ever calculated the 👑's hourly rate for all this "service", compared to say a nurse or an aged care worker?
I have always said and I will keep saying there a drain on resources
He looks more ridiculous than his mother 🤡🤣
Here is a great piece on who Charles really is: https://www.youtube.com/live/COShAn5-qUs?feature=share
The royals are stollen valour
Yes finally some who agrees with me the royal family are biggest crims I'm a Scotsman living in Australia they don't do anything all that land and people can't pay there bills
Knights of Malta
I still think that Diana death was set up by Charles… but I think her sons William and Harry will change the monarchy when William takes over…. I believe they will help the people… because they have Diana’s spirit part of them… watch and see… I’m waiting for William to become king! It will be Diana’s revenge
I’m shocked to find out what English people were not taught the proper history between England and Ireland .
exposes? Yet another deluded lefty attacking the Monarchy with lies and hate
Even as a child i remember asking my Mom what exactly the Royal family does.  They don’t really seem to have a purpose.
You grabbed my attention and secured my agreement within the first 30 seconds!  Thank You for speaking truth to the power junkies and criminals.  You are so bloody right in all you say.    The cosplaying of the royals is laughable.  Mountbatten had a couple of rooms filled with his military costumes!  Sickening!!
God is my King.
Those stubby fingers indicate medical issues , the heart to be more to the point.
@ IV'E SEEN THE FACE OF THIS MAN WHO IS CRITICISING KING CHARLES,  BEFORE: AS A 'RUSSIAN SUPPORTER CONGRATULATED DIRECTLY BY 'PUTIN'.    @ AND THIS IS WHY ALL 'OF 'PUTIN'S ATTEMPTS AT GAS LIGHTING 'KING CHARLES',  ARE PATHETICALLY EASY TO SEE THROUGH AND PREDICTABLE. @  SOD OFF 'PUTIN'. THE MAJORITY OF US BRITISH, HAVE LOYAL AND GOOD HEARTS, AND ALSO WE ARE TOO INTELLIGENT TO DIVIDE OURSELVES BY BEING FOOLED BY YOU.
Bullshite you don,t like  leave
You swore the oath forgoten so soon ?
I feel sorry for Charles the turd
Who did Sausage fingers pledge to serve? Did we get a mention?
Cromwell couldn't take our castle. When he got to power he put forward an act of parliament to have it demolished, the c*nt!
You miss use the word meek, that's not its true meaning.
I can't deny much of anything of what you're saying. But you forget that sometimes this is the flawed culture that the majority want to see continued. And you are right, it's wrong. I do hold hope however that if parliament support to oppress its people like it did in the thatcher years that the king would be a voice for decent to the system. But I guess the tripartite system doesn't really work because the king is in bed with them all and he has parliamentary chains around his neck (necessary for the system and was so historically).  So what are you advocating? An American system? That clearly doesn't work either (for the most part)....
people support charles for 1 reason no royal family equals a faster islamic brittain which is happening so fast britain not for the british we gave a world a home now the next gen world wanna park up aswell.
I spent five years active and 25 reserve in the US Army.  Never saw combat so I have just a few metals, mostly for service time "thank you for coming" type.    My wife asked me about the metals Charles wears.  I explained that he has more than me, but mine have the distinction of being earned.
Game of Thrones is just a slight glimps into the Royal family, everything right down to brother and sister having sex and children. Come on people, wake the fuck up, you are bowing down to and worshipping a family of inbred maniacs who get thrills from  watching  you live in poverty and your children starve, that is how insane and mentally ill rulers behave
Theses Royals are involved in a global espionage. The Milner - Fabian model built upon the Royal Society and the East Indian Empire guarantee us an International technocratic prison headed by this counter-initiatory cosplay King.
Charles can get effed!
When he mentions in the video that they should be made to live in Council houses, two memories crossed my mind...A book i read  called The Queen and I by Sue Townsend. I read it many years ago before the very dubious sad demise of Diana!!  I can't recall how the story began but the Royal Family were ousted from the many stately homes they hold and had to live on a council estate, it was a good read 😅  The other memory is more recent...its a You Tube video called .. A Morning in 1958, it caught my attention, as a recommended video, because thats my birth year and also it's set in the North of England, as also i am, born & bred.  Its worth watching from an historical point of view and also an eye opener, esp given that its only 6 yrs after the Queens Coronation...such a stark contrast,  the poverty is grim, its hard to believe its the same country as the Queen is seen in all her opulence and yet families are crammed in tiny spaces, come to think of it we still are, AND we 'didn't' have sterile 'everything' but still we survived... All the hypocrisy today is nothing new, its just that the 'establishment' don't like the fact that we are more objectional now ...or are we? Wasn't Guy Fawkes in the 1600's also objectional hence his attempted plot!!! Search FCO 30/1048, read what it actually resulted in re the sovereignty of the UK in 1971...a memorandum withheld from the public for 30 years as classified!!  The Queen would have been fully aware of it and yet still pretended she was sovereign throughout all the many years later ...so it begs the question - can the Son of a Queen, who's sovereignty was surrendered, by the act of the UK joining the EU, which was in breach of our constitution anyway, actually be crowned a 'King'!!!????  My only King is God, who on the Cotonation Oath they swear to serve...!!! I have to add here i do not believe in the' God set by religious orders and denominations..,  My God is...  Universal Source Energy ,Our Creator, God is Love - Love is Life.  We were not intended to be 'made' to live in fear of anything!!!
King Charles is The Antichrist.
This idiot exposed nothing! A diatribe!!
Long live the king.....stop whinging......Can't people have some fun ......this world's already messed up
Please, might i ask - what is a lauper? and did i spell it correctly?
Boring 😴 boring 😴  history makes a country? You destroy our country with your boring nonsense....
The royal family has so much blood on their hands.
It is repulsive to have seen this expensive theatre on show this weekend , when this country is struggling in EVERY way. On a radio station recently which is asking the public to donate money for children, he said some families are so poor that they are having to RE-USE babies nappies. In 2023. It is very insensitive to have held this lavish display. It COULD have been done on a much more modest scale.  I believe the whole concept of a monarchy is outdated, irrelevant and it is  insulting just to see this  opulence compared to how we the 'public' are having to struggle . It is long overdue that the people of the UK should finally be allowed a democratic vote on this.
Cracking channel on here!  Down with the establishment!
100 million is not even £2 each so who gives Shit?
He will not follow his mother foot steps with honor and integrity! He is a slime ball global elite he will do whatever the Globalist want and screw the British people!
ITS SIMPLE. CENTURIES AGO A CHARACTERISTIC INDIVIDUAL WAS POPULAR AND FOLLOWED AND IDOLIZED. A INNER CIRCLE FORMED INTO A GANG. IT GOT LARGER AND LARGER. HE SAID DO THIS AND THAT AND I WILL INSURE U A BETTER LIFE. BUT THE WHOLE MOTIVATION PARTICIPATED ROBBING KILLING STEALING TAKING RESOURCES FROM COMMINERS IN THE OUTER LANDS. THE GANG BUILT A LARGE NAVY AND ARMY. AT THIS POINT NO ONE BETTER CHALLENGE THE GANG. THE  CHARISMATIC INDIVIDUAL BECAME A MONARCH. HIS FAMILY BECAME ROYALS. THE PEOPLE PUT THEM ON A PEDESTAL THUS SOMEWERE THREW TIME. IT DIDNT MATTER ABOUT MERIT ABOUT THEIR OFFSPRING. THE INSTITUTION BECAME CONCRETE IN PERPITUITY BY THE PEOPLE'S... THEN WORLD DOMINANCE BEGAN ROBBING MURDERING LAND THEFT.... UNTIL PRESENT DAY THIS FAMILY HAS BEEN SUGERCOATED AS A FAMILY OF HONOR AND SQUARE DEALING OF GOODNESS.. ALL BS...THE BULSHIVICKS IN RUSSIA TOOK THE EXTREME ROUTE AND ASSASSINATED THAT ROYAL FAMILY. MANY OTHERS ABOLISHED THEIR INSTITUTIONS.WITHOUT VIOLENCE.. THIS BRITISH THING IS A CIRCUS AT THIS POINT. I DONT RECOGNIZE THEM AS NOTHING ROYAL.THEY R A FAMILY OF AND FROM ANCIENT GANGSTERS .... I WILL DIGRESS NOW...

What a load of cack
Well said
No disrespect here-I personally have always thought that Countries like Australia and Canada were plenty big enough to run their own countries.Is it just statis to have a King or Queen over you?
FACTS BROTHER TELL THEM THE MONARCHY ARE A FARCE
If we got rid of them tomorrow tourists would still come here as well.
How they got into power was by performing austerities, sacrifices and giving in Charity in previous births, because they did for their own self interest and not for the pleasure of God they have a demonic mentality. All living entities get exactly what they deserve, the laws have been given in all scriptures, as you sow. you shall reap - do unto others as you would have done unto you. So we all get what we deserve, we all flagrantly ignore Gods laws and turn away from Him and consequently we get the result of demonic leaders, constant wars and unfavourable living conditions. There are no material solutions to these problems only a spiritual one when the mass of people turn towards God and follow His rules.
So true
Well said. My thoughts too 👍
Queen Charles
Bravo!!!
The Royal family need to be done away with.
They paid for this corranation from all the hardworking people, there is only one KING AND THAT IS THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.
Great piece. I must check up on Colonel Rainsborough, is that how you spell it? Sounds like a guy I would like. Anyway, what exactly were you arrested for?
Very interesting,thank you
Scumbags all of them.
Private Carr : - I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking King. ( Ulysses, p.525 )
As long as you have a prick in charge we will have the same problems. Americans have the system you want and their government brutalizes them. I think we would need a radically different system. Maybe some kind of anarchist state with direct democracy where we strive to give each other accurate information so we can vote on the issues that matter to us taking others into consideration and rolling up our sleeves to do what needs to be done OURSELVES no "rulers" who can lie to embezzle resources. Maybe the internet would make it possible. I doubt it will bring about utopia, but it sounds like a step in the right direction to me. Saying that, the system I mentioned might be so different to everyone else's a load of other countries might attack us. That's what happened to anarchist states in the past.
2030 depopulation periods... One world order... Stay woke
We mock... That's it... God fuck the king
...I'm pretty sure you can still get executed for treason so buckle up mate! I'm sure you know the risks. Just make sure you have a system in place in case you win. You don't wanna go down like Cromwell.
...Well, when you get rid of the euphemisms they're no different to a protection racket. They have their hired muscle... police are roadman, doctors and big pharma are drug dealers, the military are  hit men/ assassins and at the top you have the don, who in this case is called a king and he even has a crime family. The only real difference is they are better staffed and way better armed than any racket.
As an American, the British royal family just seems embarrassing. Almost just like a shitty celebrity. Less attractive Kardashians. Lol
GOD BLESSES YOU BRAVE SOUL❤‼️‼️
GOD BLESSES YOU BRAVE SOUL❤‼️
Love it brother I'm a Tim and I really admire the fact that you as an ex soldier can see the scum for what and who they really are he was best friend's with Jimmy the beast and Andrew best friends with Jeffrey the beast what the FUCK !!!!!!!
Dictators love living a ravishing live on other people money. They steal from the poor and live a luxurious lifestyle. 😢
I am not a fan of the royal inbred family. They are as corrupt as the Canadian government.
A well articulated explanation.
sounds like you have a chip on your shoulder and are not worthy of this world .
Your doing a great job 👏 👍 keep them coming 👏 👍 💪 👌
And the thing parading around with the worst pedophiles is how they are succeeding in making us sick to our stomachs....THANK YOUUUU SO MUCH FOR DEFENDING OUR CHILDREN.....THANK YOUUUU SO MUCH..... 🙏 💞 ♥️
To start a monarchy?? We are seeing it in Canada with this Prime Minister lawless and nazis....I don't know why the Europeans are not preparing their young for the nazis of Canada because if we can't hold the line and raise awareness....the young people of the World should be prepared ...they are brainwashing the people from India here and now South America......they cheat the elections and nothing more we can do for our Planet....Jesus also told me they are keeping children prisoners underground and He will save only the ones praying really hard for those Children...No one else....PLEASE PRAY FOR YOUR SOULS TO BE SAVED AND YOUR COUNTRIES.....MAY YOU BE FOUND WORTHY.....TOGETHER IN OUR HEARTSSS AND PRAYERS FOREVER.....THANK YOUUUU.....🙏 💞 ♥️
UK royal men in black entered the chat..
How refreshing to hear some truth 👏👏 well said
💯% AGREE! he is nobody, puppet in the hands of richest ;)! His presence allows the rest of the rich to claim and excuse, exercise and justify their richness in the eyes of the poverty and struggles. All this is a camouflage and a puppet show. Bunch of snakes. Snake nest.
I see your point but to say the French model is good....have you ever heard of the Terror? Havevyou read about the Vendee War? The genocide that happened in the west of France in the 1790s? The ttuth is that all power setups are corrupt.
AWESOME THANK YOU  DON'T WORRY THIS   WAS A FINAL PARTY. ONLY DAYS LEFT FOR THIS ROYAL FAMILY.  THIEVES THEY NEED TO RETURN ALL STOLEN GOODS. OTHERWISE DAYS ARE NUMBERED. HE WAS SAD BECAUSE HE KNOW THAT THE THRONE IS NOT HIS.
What a prat you are.
I just found that I was no longer subscribed to this channel, neither was my girlfriend. I hope this was a coincidental double mistake on both our parts rather than covert censorship. Anyone else experienced this?
As a former soldier you have  betrayed your oath to the country and your monarchy a traitor and may God do away with u. For the king has done more service for this country than u could ever dream of he to has served in the armed service  GOD SAVE THE KING  GOD SAVE KING CHARLES 🇬🇧
Its sounds like the anc, my friend, the only ones i have time for was Princess Diana and princess Catherine and Prince William, the rest of them are very low
Joining the army means you serve your king and country.  Hypocritical Buffon , or are you just wanting to be a hero and attract  attention to your sorry bitter & sad life.
Andrew is a pedo and I am sure Charles is the same 😢 poor babies that they mess with 😔
Fantastic insight from an intelligent man…
I am kinda okay with the British Monarch before when I saw the late Princess Diana was really charismatic and sincerely help people. Now it changed when she gone.
By jove old boy you say it how it is not how they'd like it to be said.   Jolly good, splendid.
Totally agree
Their not the right full hairs to the crown anyway.  The real King lives in Australia  it all stemed  back from Henry viii  who was a false king
You were a soldier well I was an Australian soldier from 1958 to 1986.I swore allegiance to queen and country did you not!I am not a monarchist but I do support the tried and true constitutional monarchy system of democracy we enjoy in Australia.I am not a big fan of Charles it was a shame that Richard the Third lost the title he legally owned Henry Tudor was a usurper he had no genuine claim on the throne.
We need a new revolution in this country. Ive lost count of how many times ave said this.  So far ive only managed to find people who are willing to bitch and moan about the way things are but not actually lift a finger to do anything. How am i supposed to raise an army when i seem to be the only vertebrate in the country.
Hurry and become one more bland mauve bureaucratic nanny state like Canada, Australia and New Zealand where your most prominent criminals wear grey suits instead of traditional military dress uniforms and your majestic architecture is over run with Walmart shoppers.  Hurry to erase and dilute the heritage and traditions of the nation that was the greatest and most influential power on earth for centuries, so that there will be nothing that defines you and unifies the people. In your envy of the privileged few, exalt and glorify the tawdry lowest common denominator. Mock and diminish the value of a small segment of society that exemplifies refinement and civility (however imperfect) so that the mongrelization of society and race to the bottom of culture is achieved. Before long your ideals will be replaced by Hollywood, Chicago, Kardashians, the African tribes and Muslim countries where people are risking their lives to escape.
What on earth do they do?!? What a friggin waste, in my humble opinion.
And the people, no matter how poor, pay the price for the kings family royalness.  The queen is gone and now so should the monarchy.
Why do we need a head of state? Whoever it is will be corrupted by the power, look at all the Global Leaders and politicians of today,they are all about themselves with no concerns for their own populations or constituents. Power corrupts no matter who it is. As technology is being touted as the way forward I suggest that every person in a country has a button on their phone that they can press to eject any politician either local or national if they aren’t happy with their performance. When the numbers of rejections reaches 51% the politician is physically ejected 20ft in the air live on prime time TV 😂. Silly I know but it would be fun as opposed to now which is silly and no fun 🎉.
Great Video my Friend, As a Canadian Orphan discarded  but adopted by British parents I was raised in England , Unfortunately was Sexually  Abused, Tortured ( SRA)( NB; NOT By My Parents!).. Went down a road of Rebellion, Addiction, Further Abuse etc I became a Psychotherapist, but most importantly came to JESUS in 1986  Who Truly Healed me  opened up the door for me to work with other , Addicts,  Victims of Abuse etc I Never had a problem with the Royal Family as Such till I found out the EVIL they perpetuate behind closed doors, there are Conspiracy Theories of course from them being Reptilian to Aliens ...LOL . To cannibals and torturing and sacrificing children..  HOWEVER... If people Actually Bothered to listen to the Testimony of Some of these Victims... They would AT LEAST... Consider the Fact these Royals are in Fact A  Line of Satanic Luciferians that are powered with a Demonic Agenda that is   Not GOOD like The Common People Think? But In Fact Very Sinister and EVIL?  See Tim Cohen's Book and Videos.." Antichrist and a Cup of Tea'.. Charles is Behind/ part of So much More than People Realise, The Whole One World Government, Climate Change/ Eugenics Plan, W.E.F and The Great Reset, Middle East Situation , United Nations, Ecumenical Movement and One World Religion etc etc 🙏🥰
Joe -- What about the Late Princess Diana? Was she worth her money as a royal?
Not a single argument was made bar insults...   Bizarre rant.
Basically just backing up what some of us already knew. The Coronation represented not just crowning of a Monarch, but much more, it's was a reaffirmation and a opportunity to send out the old message, we are still your rulers and you are still our plebeian subjects and we are all about POWER and MONEY.
I already don't support them 💙💜🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Bravo! I salute you for speaking the truth. No one needs royals, billionaires nor predatory capitalists! Enough!
People look at me weird when I say this kind of thing about the royals. I think they are just shocked when they see someone who can think for themselves.
This is so true 150million for coronation why didn’t he pay himself with all his cash instead the public had to pay  In this time when nurses wan t reasonable pay and all the others striking for good conditions and pay and now the Queen had 600 million where the hell do they get this sort of money They have large clothes allowance and a lot of other allowances too many to mention our country is going down hill people struggling with a choice to eat or heat and they are sitting on millions it seems an unfair situation that the government take off of the country’s people but not the royal family
Charlie's association with jimmy saville is yet to be explained?!!🤔
He should be pledging allegiance to us …
Always makes me laugh when they say they work so hard, but what the royal family call work , visiting countries, cutting ribbons and going to the shows . We the normal people call that a day out.
This f-wit doesn't actually know anything.  Why do low IQ people always think that their views are valuable? 🤔
I have been a royal watcher for a long time,Charles passed in early 2020,This beady eved clown is not Charles Windsor, why has none of you noticed ?
you are right about every thing dude
All the people has to do is to look into their story/ history
Satanists..,Luciferians..they admire..Satan
Bravo! Arch
The highest paid public servants
well he did admit in front of the church and the whole nation/world on his coronation with his hands on the bible that he is insincere so dont be expecting any good to come out of him " THE FAKE  KING"
thank u sir thank u sir more vids
Another question a**hole ..what price do you put on elevating the standing and status of this country ??
Shouldn't he be on a horse on the front in Ukraine.
what your country lost in its anti establishment views, it made up for, got channeled thru your comedians. British comedy is some of the most wacked out brilliance to be ever invented. not to mention your music over the decades. I think such a conservative and regimented social structure really created some of the most 'out of the box' art to ever live. goes to show, you can't crush the human spirit, it just redirects.
Is the UK really a democracy?
The only reason this family sits on piles of money and unbelievable tracts of land is because their forbearers came across the oceans, from another country and committed violence/murder to take it all. There is nothing regal in this behaviour or the acts of their previous generations. There is not a royal family on this globe that did not get to where they are without killing for it, and then passing that wealth to their children.
"The Americans will never shut up about their Revolution"... True statement! Many of my family members were in the Revolution! Thank God!! FREEDOM!!!!!!!
What a brilliant mind this former soldier, Joe Glenton, possesses, with a solid hold on true British history.  Our troubled world needs more minds like his.
I love this guy...I'm subscribing immediately!!!!!
For me the Coronation was a Big Clown Show. WE are now in the year 2023 and the world no longer needs Kings and Queens they belong to a distant past. Monarchy should be completely abolish. They are nasty people, corrupt, Satanic as well.
His BFF was serial pedo Jimmy Savile.  No way Mi5 and 6 didn't warn him and the queen about his ways.  His relative Lord Mountbatten was a serial pedo.  So is his brother.  I wonder about him too, he's a clown.  UK needs to boot the royals.
Valorizing monarchy is worshiping psychopaths. These people are parasites, nothing more.
You Brit’s still don’t get it do you ? Here in America we vote for our leader. The people come first here in America. In 2023. Y’all need to learn to adapt to current societal ways.
Grifters-in-Chief
A British person with beautiful teeth. WOW. Haven't seen this b4. Must take gr8 care of yall teeth in your military. Our dentists in US Military are barbarians. Numb u up at noon and start drilling at 1202. Or pull wisdom teeth like digging for precious stones.
Same as North Korea  🇰🇵 .... except NK 🇰🇵 is an infant Monarchy in the making & 900 years behind the UKs 🇬🇧 .
What an idiot! Even if they did step down they own a lot of land! Tax-dodgers?! They PAY taxes- and have over 40 years!! Get back on your meds!
Charles is not a good king or even a good example to the people,William and Cathrine could give the royals a couple that could be something to look up to.There is something great about having Royals.
Caused destruction and poverty worldwide 😢
We all know they're greedy, got their grubby fingers in everything
Preach brother, preach!!! I cant stand them!!
The scum Roman German Gangster fake royal do not bring money, They steal it from others. Example, The Hebrides of Scotland, The Original Rulers of Albion before the scum Freemason Religious liars took over.
I agree with you its over we are in 2023 🌴⛵
Sex pistols 😂😂  sold out to the capitalist system when he went utterly butterly ad, so much for God save the Queen shit song Johnny boy.  What crap, you made a pledge when you joined up. What's the difference between you little soldier boy"serving your country" and them "serving your country". You both lots done it for money except you got less.
Charlotte is a billionaire,George is a billionaire.and Louis .Where did they get that money and why are people starving and can’t pay bills But Hod says vengeance is mine
What a load of rubbish.  You've exposed nothing!
All hail the pee dough king.
Big 'agree' from me for a lot of these points, BUT, it has to be done RIGHT. Take The Romanovs, for example. Rightfully deposed from Power for not managing Russia correctly, and dragging it into a completely unnecessary war... only to be ultimately replaced with STALIN.
Utter BS..... UK people are it's own traitors.... Sometimes you have to deal with countries who you don't agree with... If you didn't where would your country be in its economy??? You're talking bollox !
Charles is suppose to serve.serve himself.look how he made his mistress,queen.
As a soldier you have an Orth to protect stand protect our King or Queen and the people of UK?? If you don't like it go to other great lands you believe are better. Charles did, not end up being a gangster by street fighting killing corruption con merchant? Charles is who he is because of where he was born and parents he had? He was born trapped in the Royal UK gilded cage of royalty.  He is who he is and can never escape be a person to do what he wants or do anything without other watching spying controlling. Every moment of his life from birth to death he is the nations prisoner Like Rudolf Hess Trapped imprisoned Protecting the nation from would be Trumps Putin's Blairs  Who you believe should take ,his place
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Born into power?/
well presented..i am in total agreement..
Panama Papers show Queen off shored hundreds of millions, I believe in preparation for when/if we oust them. We need to seize that (our) money before we get rid of them.
Wow  You’re brave and fearless , I will give you that 😊
The problem is some people they don’t know that they are commons , and this guy Charles is king , if he wants you he can just use his power and destroy you . This guys after him there will s a generations of the kings. But some people like this man who chats like man is nothing. I would advise you just word hard to look after your family. God blessing these kingdoms . Commons their nothing.
'Artists' no longer challenge the status quo, they suck up to it.  Too many people with blinkers on and can't see all the vile connections of the 'monarchy'.  Charles being a close mate of Jimmy Saville being one..  Many say that this monarchy brings in a lot of money due to tourism, but that's not a good enough excuse to hang on to this outdated mafia clan.   All the wealth they have while millions struggle for a decent wage.
Separate Question:  How disappointed in Harry is the British military?  Do they feel abandoned / let down by, him?
It is the whole monarchy structure that needs to be dismantled.  It is not real.  The media brainwashes the public.  I can't stomach the dishonest narratives of mainstream media.  Time to move on.
In all your years as a soldier have you / had you heard anything ab't some missing children out of Canada?  You want to hear scandal:  I'm still waiting to hear whatever happened to the 34 or so, some odd kids that QE II walked out of a Canadian school with.  Supposedly, she offered to take the kids on a 'little trip". Telling staff:   "They'll soon be back'.  The end of school came.  Parents showed up to retrieve their kids.  They waited outside the school building.  Wait......what????.......No kids.  According to what I know of the story the school children (all under the age of 11) were never returned to any of their families. It's now been 50-55yrs and to my knowledge there's been no closure for these families. I may have the time frame wrong but I think the incident took place sometime around 1973 or '74. Do you know anything about it?  Just curious.  If anyone knows any different please do so, inform me.  Thank You.
Why are the far left so angry I reckon if I spoke to 100 people I would be able to guess 95% who they are and sure enough got this one right as well what a load of BS is there a part two as you didn't expose one thing about King Charles? This country is a million miles away from a Republic not even 2% ... using France as a good example of republicans is laughable they are angry fed up people always on strike often rioting my advice to anyone that thinks being a republic country is good, move  to one there no one is stopping you leave .... not sure why you use I'm an ex soldier as a credible argument so what
Fine words
Charles will be the worst thing to happen to this nation.
Am with you brother
Complete and utter rubbish.  Go and live in another country!  You are not wanted in this country - you Traitor!!!
As an ungrateful colonial 😊, well spoken.
Finally the truth about individuals in high authority places being revealed. 2023 is thefinal years of Judgement for all mankind living on earth by prophecies of God who created this world and humanbeing for His Glory and Joy in etenity. Common man must wakeup from slumber and see whats coming over the East Horizon. God bless
Emigrate  if you dont like it , it wont change ,its a free world you can go where you like just apply for a visa
I have never know people who sponge of everyone but never known a days hard work in their lives
What about their friendships with people like Saville and other p#*doph!les? Why is that? What is that about?  How many children were victims of these men?
You don't mention paedos .trafficking etc. EPSTIEN  WILL BLOW IT ALL APART .
When they buried the queen, they should have put the rest of royal family into the same hole
Scumbag monarchy
Great video
every brain has a lust for power
Which Sergeant major upset you during your service?
How dare you call are king 🤴😂😂😂😂👍
This is so well said - I believe they are a bunch of inbred thieves, crooks and murderers - I always think of Diana!?
I totally agree, people are going to be shocked when they find out what this shocking bunch got up too. They are all fake ,not one real royal amongst them. The only true one with a Royal line is Diana.
You should consider supporting the English constitution party, no manifesto, just the constitution, the republic is on the agenda
Monarchism and hierarchism were introduced to our world by force and deception by the demonic Annun-archons when they infiltrated and invaded our holograqhic matrix world and plane-t called Oshun/Gaia/Sophia/Tiamat/Earth-Heart of the cosmos for this is where the melanated angels were seeded as the chosen ones to save all the different species that had been enslaved on different worlds by the Annun-archons.  This parasitic egregore that resides on the astral plane and manipulates this holo 3 dimension by intercepting the light codes and using Earth's 12 stargate portals and indigenous melanated angels whose mechanics and DNA strands have been deliberately damaged to degrade them to a level they can be used to manifest whatever they wish thereby controlling the family of man's collective unconscious or souls.   This beautiful holodeck that is based on abundance has been caputured and continues to be programmed as a slave colony for interdimensional parasites who disconnected from source because their ego got the better of their divine minds that resulted in a mental pathology of schizophrenia and psychopathy. All rulers are from the lineage of the Annun-archons who are manifestations of the Schizophrenic and psychopathic God called Yaldabaoth/Yahweh/Jehovah/Anu, etc.
I think it`s time to get rid of this lot. Colonialism was shocking. As a British Citizen born in a British Colony Northern Rhodesia (Zambia) not from choice, but by birth right. Both my father and his brother fought in the 6th South African Amoured  Division attached to the British 8th Army in North Africa. Very seldom you hear of what the South African Union Defence force did / help the British who by the way during both World wars, not for getting that the British invaded South Africa twice in the 1800`s and colonized the country which was the start off APARTHEID. The British introduced the PASS LAWS to control the Indian migrants as labour as they needed to cut the sugar cane from the sugar cane farms. The British Royalty is PASSED ITS SELL BY DATE. NEEDS TO GO.
You just sound bitter, something has obviously happened to you, do you need a hug?
I totally agree with you, time they went.
WOW!
Great video 👍
I truly believe that the UK monarchy’s resistance to real change will be their downfall. King Charles has stated that he wants to see a smaller monarchy, but is he the one who should be driving this. It’s a bit like the King mouse being in charge of restructuring the cheese cupboard. It won’t happen. If our UK monarchy wants a future role then it must be ready to accept significant change and I don’t see that happening at the moment for several reasons. The UK monarchy Plc is big business and provides influence, position and well paid roles to a number of people who are key in advising the monarch on what the nation feels. As a nation, the UK can easily survive and flourish without a monarchy. They are NOT the mother or father of the nation, they do not provide leadership, we elect a government to do that. But..I do believe that there could be a role for the monarchy in a future UK, but not in its current form. As a minimum the following changes need to take place. The monarch gives up their role as head of state. Oaths of allegiance are made to the UK state and people, not to the monarch A significant reduction in the size and cost of the Royal family Finally…please please can we have a new National anthem. Good save the King or Queen is absolutely crazy. What about our country and people? All oaths of allegiance are made to the state, not the monarch The number of working Royals are reduced but not by the King alone but an independent group to include members of the current Royal,
Excellent Channel!! 👏👏👏
The Queen was just as rich and greedy like others before her and it just continues
And so you blame them because You don’t know your rightful standing & don’t realise that you don’t have to pay tax either: stand up & stand strong, educate yourself and do not consent to be governed & then you have no reason to whinge about them compared to us!
There is only one true kind caring loving giving king 👑 and that's our Lord Jesus Christ 🥰 I lovingly wait for his return ❤️ as he is the only true king 👑 that I love and adore 🥰 have no time for any other king 👑 on this dark evil satanic world 🌍 Jesus is and always will be, Lord of Lords and king 👑 of kings ❤❤❤ makes me wonder 🤔 if Charles may become the antichrist, as ever time, I see our British flag, and see Charles face, I always end up saying yuck.... Does anyone else have the same feeling?
God this chanel puts out some shit !
All is So False ,  but people are so blind in this country !
Charles is Rockerfella and Rothschilds toy...
Giving them a council house is a bit kind… stick them on a waiting list for one like the rest of us.
This is a petulant King with no sense of shame. I would add he has no real Christian values, is just as sexually undisciplined as his brother Andrew, and did not learn anything about duty from his Mother, and shouts to get his own way like a toddler. This should be printed in big headlines. All I've heard today is adulation about the 'magnificent' day yesterday. Give them an over-expensive parade and the ignorant masses are eating out of the royals' hands. Apart from the music in the Abbey and the great attempts of the Archbishop to keep the Oaths Christian plus his sermon about Jesus being the Humble Servant, yesterday's performance was simply a sham, a pantomime enacted to satisfy the greedy pride of the King and his attempt to remove Christ from Christianity and promote the devil as master, calling for all his subjects to join him on the dark side with their oath.
Worshipper of Satan!
I'm not pledging allegiance to the king of edom...I think they are thiefs...I am told they steal.. Saw video on it.. they steel gold from africa
Your kings and queens are jewish!
My respect to the royal family and indeed God save the king! ❤️
Why is it the British people love the royalty? I could care less.
How many times do you think this crosses people's minds? You know, nothing ever closed. No questions were ever answered. It didn't happen the way they said it did. France is in the dead center of this. Many of us kind of lived the Kennedy assassinations when this happened with diana. No answeres for that either. We're all old now and won't live long enough to find the truth. We don't forget, we just can't get into the paperwork that's hidden somewhere.
My dad paid 40% tax all his working life, when he died he had to give 40% of his life savings to the queens coiffeurs called 'inheritance tax' that goes directly to the queen, she then uses it to pay off her sons paedophile charge to keep him out of prison, and these idiots celebrate it waving their union jacks.
Completely agree, they dont do anything for the people and on top of that they make our lives significantly more difficult just to afford a ridiculous luxurious life that they don't deserve. They must go 100%
Thank's for your military service , alas you fall under the heading Plebs that dislike success , Royalty, Money , they bring in £580 million a year  would you care to tell us how much you bring in to the country
the royals are a waste of taxpayers money
British taxpayers will contribute about £5 each towards the cost of the Coronation day.  I think that's worth it.  Take a look at the 10'
the royals, a bunch of leeches up to their necks in scandal, the queen paid money to cover up andrews peado ways. they are a disgrace. loyal to cover ups thats what they are. in the army they got protected like babies, while real soldiers like myself and fellow comrades were up front fighting as its in our blood, no such thing as "For Queen and country". they should fu*k off
U DO NOT UNDERSAND WHY THE PEOPLE ARD SAIVE   AND ACCEPT THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR THE LIFESTYLE OF THE ROYALS    AND  THEMSELVES ARE STRUGLING TO MAKE A LIVING  BUT APLAUD THE ROYALS
👏👏👏👏
Have you guys read Nostradamus‘s book ? In there it says he won’t be king for long and that the next one in line will be overstepped by in this case Prince Harry,who’s sussed out and told secrets of the Royal Family already…..well hopefully he will be a better King or some kind of level headed, better leader
God save the king long live the monarchy🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇬🇧
Thank you so much
When l think about the Zulu war I question what were the British doing there in the first place other than to capture land, minerals or gold as usual.
Pledging any allegiance whatsoever to Charles, is like pledging allegiance to Satan, himself. It is not good for you in any way, shape or form.
There will always be RICH PEOPLE.  It is up to us to work hard and make something of ourselves.  I think it's lovely having a Royal Family.  Don't care if they get £1 off me per year :)
Jesus is King of the Kelts. Charlie the T'ird, who's he?
Gangsters, total waste of uk taxpayers money . Monarchy must be banned
The King pays no tax.  Total social parasite.
back in the days of Cromwell the monarchy had much more power than they do today, so abolishing it would have had a bigger impact on daily life. if you abolish the monarchy today you must also abolish the web of corruption in the institutions around it. the army, police, parliament, secret services, banks etc are all institutions that are tied to and protect each other, the royal family is just a part of a larger structure. reformation shouldn't stop with the monarchy otherwise it may just be superficial.
gangsters they are and gangsters they will remain until something is done to do away with them.
No one should be born to rule over us 😊
Teachers & nurses do not work for pitance
I totally agree with you mate, I cant stand this fairytale shit. Makes me sick, and now some mistress slut is your queen 😅🤣🤣🤣🤣
Listen to Tim Cohen what he has to say about Charles or read his book “The Antichrist and a Cup of Tea”.
If you're gona stand for truth be prepared to stand alone
They were best friends with Jimmy Saville, one of them has child sex charges from hanging around with Epstein, 20 Canadian indigenous orphans disappeared after the queens visit, a dead body was found buried at sandringham, butlers have accused male members of sex abuse and I could go on. Let’s prosecute them put them in prison and get on with our lives 👊
Jesus Christ died for our sins and was buried and He rose again on the third day.
“Sucking up to this family of inbred morons”- I couldn’t have described the people of Britain, and the Royal family, better! 👍🏻
The majority of people in the North West don't support them. Many people are using food banks and suffering in work poverty here. I get angered because the government can find over 200 million to pay for the coronation and yet workers can't get a proper pay increase. I work full-time but struggle and battle on like many millions across the nation. There needs to be change at some point.
As a born and raised mixed Brit, if we get rid of the monarchy, there is nothing that makes us British anymore, especially with all the immigration the government is letting in from The Islamic world.
I used to get really passionate about this issue; nowadays I don't have the energy, so I simply ignore their existence.
Well see ya
Lord Rothschild is his adviser and the real power.
Imagine pledging allegiance to a man who wishes he was Camila's tampon... the absurdity is unreal.
It's so funny reading all these comments, especially people harping on about their tax money.. Go and add up the money you've paid in tax and you'll find it's absolutely pittance.. A brand new mile of motorway costs 40 million plus.. NHS 130 billion a year etc..  If you don't like the Royals that's fare enough but please stop spouting rubbish about tax money, conspiracy comments about Diana etc..
Charles n the royals are all pedos.
There's only one King, King Jesus 👑🙏🏻
Respect to you my brother 🫡
❤❤❤❤ Love the king❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The younger generation might not be interested in the monarchy.. But there too snowflaky to do anything about it.
I'm sure you know so much more that you can talk about. Soon the whole truth will be revealed
Weak men make for hard times. Charles is weak. He cannot manage his own household, how can he manage being king?
Poor presentation.  State facts.  This is just rabble.  I actually wanted to hear/see facts.   I appreciate anyone who have served their country.  However, this is just a diatribe of complaints.   I wanted to understand the point, with facts.
Much Much  respect for bringing this up 👍🏽💯💯
Well said.
Hated him and Camilla for the treatment of Diana now livid she is to be called Queen!. How can that be right and just seen a video of him Charles punching hard a horse in the neck saying don’t do this to me now because the horse was playing up at his precious polo match. Disgusting behaviour and he showed his other side with his childish temper tantrum over the pen leak incident.Can not stand him or her.Agree with you .
The Queen is dead . Get over it . Why we have Charlie here a chimola god knows . Think slap head or ginger should of had a go . Why the uk has to keep suffering this expensive royals who are in there own little club and fuck the common folk? At least we can be thankful we don't have Puking the short.
Very clear, spot on! ;-)
As an example,just with Balmoral and Sandringham,Royalty owns more than 80000 acres of land,just for themselves,to go riding and shooting(killing) they love it!
Wow what a flashback I vaguely remember people standing for the national anthem in cinemas or am I dreaming???
As a Brit ,I wish that the majority would grow balls and demand the end of the Monarchy and all it's hanger ONS!  The money the government could save and make the country good again. Bring back a decent NHS and other social benefits.
I don't see how getting rid of them would change a dam thing.  Do you think we would benefit from what we would save. I personally i don't trust him, But for all there excesses, I think our leadership  is what we really need change.
Experimenta um presidente e vais muito rapido pedir para o Rei voltar!!!
You guys do know that their not British, and are actually German right?
Pledging allegiance to Charles 🤔 The Germans had to do the same not so long ago to Adolf……
That's why I admire Harry ...he   ran ...tried to live a " normal life " is trying ..he did his duty and went to the coronation..and left as soon as he could
the trouble with your expose on anything ...you are a naive ,ill informed ignoramus and have no idea how any economy works.
You are a spineless traitor to the oath you took.
These are Rothschilds royal family  ...  Related to prince Albert .. the barvarian illuminati
Got to power by murdering there  own family ...
German nazi royals..... end monarchies. Jesus is the only true king
Great video
Long to golden rain over us.. sums it up. Great video! Where are the artists".. maybe here ;-) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PglUSCyoMAk
Charles is a miserable bad tempered man
My pledge to the Queen died with her. I won't be taking another to the King sausage fingers
Interview the victims of their sick abuse!
They are a bunch of sick humans involved Satanic sexual abuse of children! Makes me violently ill and should pay for their inhumane behaviour
Charles unpopular?! Pfff you really need to move on with the times from the 90s to the 21st century! 🤦
the British monarchy is the most murderous monster in human history
Did you see Andrew wearing everything he was stripped of ? What a mupit. Turns out it costs around 250,000,000 in the end .but the ones who are the heroes have to strike to get a pittance for saving millions of lives .he's not my king, and she stole the crown, so not my queen either. God bless. Lee
Mate of mine, 17 years in the military was fuming at the money being spent whilst the people of this country he fought for are dying & struggling
theres no equality in the U.S. its the most lop sided modern country in the world. its far to capitalist you need that perfect mix of capitalist and socialist to have equality fairness or as close as you can get it to it
They could seel 1 crown to feed homeless in the uk
They are all demonic reptillian
I like coronation chicken, I think I might be part of the bourgeoisie.
"Former British Soldier" .. Shame he couldn't hack it. This is precisely the type of twerp we need as cannon fodder.
Sue Townsend did put queen elizabeth on council house in her book,taking a cup to neighbours to borrow something. Wow,we Indians loved that book!
By accusing the royal family of not paying tax it’s obvious you don’t have the first clue what you are talking about
Regarding the opium wars and compelling indian farmers to produce opium and indigo instead of food they sorely needed,people used to say in India that queen victoria was the biggest drug mafia. How can the royals rejoice when English people are facing such difficulties. That man Charles has been drooling over the British crown for so long,he looks pathetic.
Stick them on the front line!
Respect
BIGGEST FKIN LYING WALT ON THE INTERNET 😂😂😂😂😂. PROBABLY GOT BINNED OUT OF BASIC FOR BEING A BIFF.
A man after my own heart. When I saw that naked boy fall to his death from the royal apartments while trying to escape those rapists on a sheet rope. I instantly saw why Jimmy Saville hung around with them.
FKIN REMF
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻
Charles and Saville were best mates, says it all really
I’ll never forget seeing a newspaper clipping showing Queen Elizabeth II & her family saluting “Heil Hitler!” In the 1940’s.  Is it any surprise to see the Monarchy embracing the WEF, WHO & the globalists Great Reset & 15-minute Cities?
Thou shalt NOT COVET dirty SINNER
I can't listen to you!!!!!!!
Then move to a different country its that simple
Charles is a total joke of a man...he completely devalued the institution of marriage by continuing to see Parker Bowles.He sucks up to all the Eco /Climate change morons and would sell this country down the river to the highest bidders
Geez didnt realize King Charles had such chubby fingers and hands lol
The French have such a better life than use, chain smoking lol This says it all! What weak propaganda.
Respect to you sir [and all our current and ex military].  Charles is NOT MY KING.
Drs and nurses were complient in murder they don't deserve a rise.
Have to agree with this man.
It's a shame we forgot and let the monarch's climb back up to the top of the dung hill  good vid cheers
The monarchy is perfectly safe as long as the oligarchs are in charge of civil society because they are the modern iteration of the feudal barons
Sorry Chuck, there's only one king and that's Jesus!
I believe 100% of all of this!
The Republic of England! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿❕️
That ex "sowja" is quite thick . He understands nothing.
the media support  them .. not my king
Are you communist or what sir .? From my knowledge and observation: British , English people are most rational, practical people who never fall into emotions sentiments..(" Britan has no eternal friends or enemies.  Britain got only its businesses"  W. Churchill.....)Also if Royal familly if its not profitable ( in some way)  - you will not keep it . All PR , popularity of monarchy was because of Queen . Spain got monarchs, Sweden, other countries... Who heard about them?  That was only ENGLISH QUEEN nr1 and people loved her. Money from tourism, gadgets..ets... Its identity, heritage.. I don't know if new King Charles will measure up to his mother?  But definitely William and Kate are in hearts of young generation 👍. I think English monarchy is very original and positive thing because it shows how you can agree conservative traditional values, heritage, with newest contemporary achievements  ideas and development in UK
And the monarchy is the last bastion of the worst kind of racism there is - they believe they are superior to everyone else because of their GENETICS.
Hey Joe, you are SO RIGHT ON. I cannot fathom why people are so blind when it comes to these people. They are tax-avoiding, inbred, criminal, palace-hopping thugs. They do not give a CRAP about people who they all consider to be below them. What you said about the change in music and entertainment is so true as well. Nowadays the average person who does not come from a privileged background even if very talented has almost no chance of 'making it' because of the whole nepo-baby thing - being an entertainer is so fabulously remunerated, way beyond what it's worth, that it's been taken over by a whole different class.  To those who say the royals are 'figureheads' and have no real power I say do your own research and discover for example how the queen had a PM of Australia taken out because he was interfering with the royals' plan to increase the price of a natural resource to benefit their pals in the cabal by encouraging native Australian peoples to 'occupy' certain lands.  The sight of Chuck kissing the hand of the FAKE royal saudi family makes me ill. Thank you.
Cargo pirates from the last reset. Disgusting
They're nothing but a flawed circus act these days.  People seem shocked over Harry, yet I see that as an inevitable repercussion of the supposed King's behaviour,  from the moment he proposed to Diana.  He's simply not up to the standard, and I find him lacking the moral fibre to walk in his mother's footsteps.  It's time to move on and for England to be taken seriously.
THIS  KING NEEDS TO BE WATCHED HE COULD TURN OUT TO BE THE ANTICHRIST
Correct!
I cant congratulate him because his kingdom if full of hate, slave owners who killed millions of Africans during slave trade,  war mongers who destroyed Many prosperous African kingdoms because of envy in one way or another, yet they were not a threat to British monarchy. Im talking about African kingdoms like the Zulu, Shona, Zimbabwe, Buganda Kingdom, Asante of Ghana etc. Many of the African ritual stones and objects like the arrows of Buganda warrior Kibuuka Omumbale and part of his jaw were captured and taken to British museum kept on behalf of the British monarchy. Kibuuka was Buganda Kingdom worrior who fought armies hidden, in the cloud with arrows. I hope that STONE under the throne doesnt contain Kibuuka's jaw and or arrow that are kept in British muesium. The same guardian angel that manifests in bees kept at one of the Royal palace, is the same guardian angel Namuzinda in Buganda, one of the Buganda Kingdom guardian angel, who manifests within bees, worrier red ants and wasps.
Someone is bitter 😂
I think we need to distinguish in regards to taking from the rich and giving to the poor. It's one thing to be a robber baron, and steal from hard-working people, while you do nothing, and quite another when you work your ass off and sacrifice for years to get where you are.
I read recently that the Provisional IRA were sanctioned by the big wigs at MI6 to assassinate LORD Mountbatten because he was fucking small boys . I was gob smacked but not surprised to learn that  Charles was friendly with Jimmy Savile as was Mountbatten . Was the Met supplier of children to the Royals ?
He'll be the last king, there'll be no more king after him, the whole world will go into war, uk will be ruined
I am in Australia. Great to see people speak out. The situation is so obvious but people seem to like them. I don't get it at all. When the queen dies, I told people that she was the richest woman in the world, was in power for 72 yrs? What has she done. They said she "served." That was it. I was trying to explain and squeeze a little more thought out of the, and I said that in the history of the world, she is the number one, literally the number one person in the history of humanity, that had the greatest opportunity to help people. What has she done? Se should have a list of good deeds from here to the moon and back, and all you can tell me is that "served" whatever that means. From literally the age of a child, confirmed by my mother, I have been asking questions because I saw things were wrong. The number one question I asked was "why?" Why can't people and see as I do. We are supposed to be awake now and they are supposed to be afraid of us. I just shake my head.
Well done to all the brave protesters giving their time. I wish I was there too.
I don't get how anyone can even tolerate let alone respect people who enslave and steal from others thinking its their right. They need to be behind bars for the atrocities committed for centuries towards their own citizens and in other nations. There's probably a lot more we don't know about. The whole concept of "Royals" is absurd. What the Elite have jointly accomplished in just these past couple of years should be enough to hold them accountable, then they dare to rub it defiantly in our faces too spending billions on extravagances whilst innocent people have been forced to suffer and struggle to mearly survive cause of their doing. There is no INJUSTICE in Gods court and that's when the patient and the non compliant free souls will rejoice.  God Willing.
Joe for president!
The whole Monarchy is a fraud it’s illegal to rob from banks but when they do it it’s legal it’s wrong to think that all we pay for is silly wars and the monarchy when people are starving in this country.
2.5 million 😮
All of the things you have said are true about the Royals, but above them are the people who control all heads of governments and royal houses, whether constitutional monarchies or republics, as the little people under these varying social frameworks are still slaves under tyranny. The USA is the best example of exactly this, and the best example of a constitutional Republic, that broke away from a monarchy (the French experience is not the same, as the people still have a big say and are by and large respected for their beliefs),  for reasons of freedom and liberty in the first instance. But look at it. Corrupted by power and money, without a whiff of a monarchy within thousands of kilometres, it is still a heartless money grubbing place where the peasants have lost out to power and avarice. Monarch are not the problem, or rather getting rid of them is not the solution to the problems you have raised, comrade.
The dark Lord this Satan king Mylus evil
The unaccountable power and money is the worst to me. Charles is the most inbred of all Royalt people. Why should they not be taxed? Then the british people should not pay a cent to them. Of course they fixed it so they don't pay taxes? Why not? yalty
Crikey - yet another moaner. If you are anti-monarchist vote for a Party with a Manifesto to abolish the Monarchy in next year's General Election!! Otherwise give the moaning a break!
Criminal family of misfits.
ALL WORLD ROYALTY IS SUBSERVIENT TO THE VATICAN JESUIT MILITARY ORDER!!!
Phew....I thought I was the only one thinking this. My missus even gave me a dirty look when the coronation was on ( I wasn't watching it) and I said 'How much is this lot costing us".........
What a load of crap.  Don’t like the Monacy don’t watch it don’t get involved
No cost of living crisis at the House of Windsor is there................................. Although I'm not in agreement that teachers and doctors are working for a pittance. What are doctors actually doing now, because they aren't seeing patients !
Tourism comes for our historic past. Todays royals are just overpaid garden show openers. And as for Camilla- I cannot believe it🙄
I’m sick of the sight of the windsors.  Too many sex deviations and sexual diviants and associates.
"Man will never be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last priest" - Denis Diderot
Look, you might be an anti royalist and that’s one thing, but you need to get your facts right - the French have always had more sophistication than the British   Re weapons -  the British economy sells weapons - but so does the U.S. big time   I think one of the issues is the oppressive power mongering by rulers - eg William the Conqueror must have been a devastating force on British people.   You don’t talk about the revolution because you didn’t win it.   I wouldn’t call that the Windsors are mafia, but it’s true that the monarchy has taken much land and wealth from the people - in the UK and throughout the colonies.   I’m not sure how you are going to reverse this. Even if you do have a revolution, there will just be another bunch of opportunists seizing wealth and power
I'm in the US, in the Pacific Northwest, but my heart is with you today, and all Brits who aren't feeling this coronation. A Queen Diana might have been lovely, we'll never know. But I cannot, will not refer to them as king and queen. I call them Chuckie and the other C word. I'm more of a queen than C is! 😏 sending you all my love today, and I'll have a proper cup of tea in solidarity. 🙁🌹☕😘I'm sure trump would approve...he too, has no class. None
Some people also do good things in secret, we don't live with the King, how could we possibly  truly know him?
You don’t need to trade off your former vocation to gain credibility. Just be who you are now.
Why is people here making a issue about this pledge of allegiance to Charles .. it’s not a compulsory!!! Another words you can swear  but you are not force to it !!! It’s entirely upto the individual…. If they want too or not !!!problem In this country we have cx all turned into this unhappy moan about everything and still moan about things that we did want… what people want really is to tear up the history book of our  nation .. tear down  bc all the statues snd  all the old buildings and start all over again and in doing so tryingbto be a perfect nation !! Well a news flash !!!! Humans are not and never will be a perfect country … it don’t matter what we say or do we will never be totally happy about anything …we the British are the biggest bunch of complainers in the world we are never happy about anything but a democracy is what we have and thank god for that ….we use god as a guidance and he was not elected he rules but what he does give us is the opportunity learn and evolve  we can’t look to the past to change the future but we can learn from our past to help us guide ourselves through the future … or another way to put things as example if z child that missed behaved would you Punish that child for his whole life and also Punish his/ her grandparents… itveould t happen so why are we wanting to punish this royal family for their ancestors mistakes…?
Time to stop paying tax
Royal families surely got a lot of free medals for doing nothing.
So thinking about having a president would be more beneficial than royalty..it be no difference really because they both do rogue dealings that’s how most billionaires become billionaires… and if you think that a president has not earned his fortune in a dodgy way then you be more  blind than I think you are …
Perhaps you should get a proper job.
Good on you man I don't care about the the monarchy
Another jealous, lazy, anti-monarchist activist! Get a job, perhaps you won’t be so bitter about anyone with wealth or success.
saying it like it is,made my day this video.thank you.
The day the u.k becomes a republic will be the day the uk will lose its identity… no matter who holds the reign of power they all have same  dodgy dealings … do you really think the president of the u.s has not got a dodgy past … that’s how they all earn their wealth by conning and doing dodgy deals and have of shore bank bc account .. so it don’t matter whether it’s the royal family or a president they all have done the dirty deals of ripping off some other country in their pasts .. that’s how the all get the wealth from ..
Thanks for speaking up gran solder 100%
PERHAPS THIS WILL HELP , SEE MEGHAN MARKLE AS : 'DIANA'S REVENGE AGAINST THE HOUSE OF WINDSOR" ! AND IT SEEEMS TO BE WORKING ,THE FAMILY IS FIGHTING AND BEING NASTY SO DIANA'S REVENGE IS WORKING !!! GIVE HER PRAISE AS DIANS SENT HER TO HARRY TO RESCUE HIM !!
THEY DO LOVE TO WEAR FAKE LITTLE MEDALS, HOW DAMN PATHETIC !! YOU HAVE A MONARCHY GOVT NOT A DEMOCRACY ANYMORE BUT THESE ARISTOCATS ARE SO GREEDY AND DISGUSTING AND WHY DO YOU STILL ALLOW THIS CRAP ?????  THE FASCIST REGIME IS CORRECT !!
Not a fan of the monarchy myself but I'm not sure this was the most eloquent argument I've heard against it. The real target is not that lot, who's removal would make diddly squat difference to the lives of most people but would harm the appeal of this country as a destination thus harming the tourism industry and all of us that work in it. We should focus on all the layers of ineffectual money grabbing corporate wealthy that make money by exploiting the labour of millions in this country. Those are the big fish and there's much bigger difference to be made there. The monarchy can fall later :)
IT MADE ME SICK THIS AM TO SEE THIS DISGUSTING INCESTOUS PEDOPHILES AND NOW YOU GOT charlie! omg ! like that Hapsburg Chin and cannot believe the people would worship these scum bags !
I totally agree with you.  People always romanticize al the ancient Kings and Queens, but they were just the strongest, toughest criminals of their day.  They kept their money and power in the family by marrying relatives.  They convinced the public they were ordained by God and made themselves glamorous and became the movie stars of their day. They have lost power over the centuries and are now just very expensive celebrities. It's time to he British people got rid of them.
You had me at 'cosplay ,' 😂 ,'God knows what happens behind closed doors ' .... Can we handle the truth ? I doubt it ...  Reptilians chasing children round the damp dungeons at our cost . Face palm .
King Chuck has no cred.
Absolute rubbish
zij hebben na de eerste wereldoorlog hun naam veranderd zij hadden duidse naam
It’s insane how the population is  brainwashed to feel so inferior to these people who look down us.  The Sex Pistols were so awake.
Ehgand was a pin prick in great patriotic war
As an African i know leftist thinking dont make, implement or growing anything. Jack💩
Absolutely agree 😊
If u want to make it in Britain get up and do it. Its a free place. Make your plan and employ some tactics.
These Windsor’s are not England kings. Are they Germans ?
Charles.....The architect of  The Great Reset. This " man " is either the main puppeteer or one of them.
As a visistor to britain ive spent about 2000 to 3000 pounds there and am drawn to royal sites and the history that goes with it. Im one of millions who visit annually. My next visit is scotland and ireland and whiskey. Im an average guy with probaably below average money. Make your sums. The bills are paid by tourist money. Give the king his party. Im not visiting a coal mine. Sorry.
This was great. I agree. The Royal families (the British and the other European ones) are parasites and must go. They are outdated.
So are they "The Sopranos" or "inbred idiots"?
The supposed royals said they demoted Andrew because of his  being friends with Epstein?  Really?  What about Chuck and his best Butt Buddy, Jimmy Saville who raped, tortured and murdered many, many small children and who knows if old spoiled brat Chuckie did these deeds along with Saville?  Why wasn't Chuckie the Rat Cheese get demoted and thrown OUT the line of succession to being the pretend King TaTa Chit of Turd Mountain?   Not to mention Queenie Lizard knighted the Psychotic Saville, really!  The so called royals need to be grabbed out their castles and hung for their crimes against humanity!  Knighting a child murderer?  Seriously, they are Lizards...
Give that man a Bell's... 😂😂. You rock dude...... 😅
I can‘t see how abolishing the monarchy will become a better place. Those millions will not be given to poor people, they will vanish into the stream of private enterprise subsidies and minister‘s salaries. And then what? But all the palaces and castles and the existence of a residing king or queen does attract tourists, quite a lot. And a too slimmed down monarchy will also be less attractive. Less tourists, less money. All the british stereotypes generate money. Problems will not vanish with monarchy, but arbitrariness will follow suit and people will still be poor.
I wondered how all you Brits put up with all that all these years - they are not “Bluebloods “ !
You are a legend! How that man can take our money while people are suffering is un-human but what TF can we do about it?
My dad was a British soldier for 30 yrs and would totally disagree
😂😂😂.
"Write"
Well Said.
Murderer
KING CHARLES IS BEING CALLED THE ANTICHRIST. HE FITS THE DESCRIPTION IN REVELATION  TURN TO GOD PERSONALLY 🙏 FATHER JESUS AND SPIRIT 🙏 RIGHT AWAY 🙏 FOR THE WELFARE OF YOUR SOUL 🙏
Thank you xxx
Wasn't his "Mum" a Lizard ?  🤔
Thanks a great great speach … Best regards
Charles was a very good friend with Jimmy Saville say no more
LMAO
HE IS NO KING OF MINE
Owned by the Rothchilds ...they are not even of lineage...it's a circus act ...they need to go
This person the King Charles  is worth  7.7 Trillion Us  Dollars  .They literally own these Countries. If they are the head of state,  you are A Subject  not a citizen. Wake up they own the land you walk on !!! That vote in Australia 🇦🇺 about giving land   full rights to the first Nation people. You can't give what you don't own , you need to be a Republic first, we all need to be!!!🐺
Thank you tell them to give back our gold. We, the common wealth, are tired 😫
they have a dark and Demonic past.  He is an agent of the New World Order.
Sausage Fingers will save the day save the Crown slipping past those Gigantic Jug Ears
The former British soldier I went out with had no time for Prince Charles, so he exposed himself instead. 😳
The king isn’t wearing any clothes and no one tells him .. figures
You are entitiled to your view , but it is OPINION , which does not always mean it's true .
Some robust views and opinions calling on the Royal transgressions. That would no doubt require an overwhelming public support to curtail it's influence, streamline the house and rid it off honorific nominalism.  No force major though among the sluggish and at times lumpen British public on this issue.
They're not even British - they're German ! They don't give a flying fig for British people  , to them we're all just dirty peasants
History written by the losers would be interesting.
Fk stinking present day politicians also!...🎯.Reform dramatically the Monarchy..it can be done.Dramaticaly DIRECT DEMOCRACY to this country...but end monarchy hmm💥
I lost all respect for the Queen  after she knighted two of the most evil men to walk this earth, Necrophiliac paedophile ( Jimmy Saville) and a mass murdering war criminal Tony Blair!
Well spoken the true king of England 🇬🇧
Gangsters intimidate and murder. Some people think they are the centre of the universe. Narcissists they are and complain they aren't the King so no one else should be. Anarchy thus results. F *** that.
They are a continuation of outright tyranny!
Nice one mate, at least there are some people who will tell the truth.
Well said mate
He said inbreds. Exactly.
❤
People struggling to survive and going to watch and cheer a bloke in a gold coach. Sycophants. All designed to brainwash the serfs so they pay their taxes and think they are doing good for the country. Total ignorance.
They were the ones who told Hitler to invade the Rhineland, which made him.
At least to my knoledge Queen Elizabeth was somwhat of a states person, instaed of a girl in a golden cage, but Chrales is not the case. If we should dich the monarchy, now will be a good time, since I excpect no good for the country from this so called king.
Do not mistake the ARAB NATION Who were originally Christian and Pagan with the ones who later on were forced or persuaded into joining mohammeds newly founded religion AKA  ISLAM.   IT  hasnt quite managed to steal and claim the Arabian history,  its artwork,  achievements,  language and nation as 'their own'  although they've done a good job of it so far.
So well said
The so-called Royals are disgusting!!!
So actually, who is Harry’s real father?
Inbred morons is the most accurate description of the “so called” royal family…
The comparison of the British to the French was more than brilliant! I’m glad my family kept our conspicuously French surname. Great job pulling the veil back on these gangsters.
Screw these gangsters. They need to pull their own weight.
The fake royals are Parasites....all of them. It's the brainwashed idiots worshiping false idols that keep the lies of evil continuing.
Ain't no way bro used france as the good example hahaha france is a shithole buddy , turnover by algerians and africans , hopefully we do something so we dont get to that point
Thank you DDN, your work is much appreciated.
This king has very dirty hands this whole coronation is hypocrisy on   levels  that is so dark and evil the oaths he took are not real and definitely not holy spirit anointed and its intresing it was done by a fellow mate of his the arch bishops of Canterbury another corrupt lying invidual
King of the Great Reset, NWO, green fascism, plandemics and 15 minutes concentration camps.
I absolutely agree with this man never a truer speech the Royal family should be ousted for their crimes against the people all over the world because they have stolen from every country in the world and they should give it all back the jewels they wear on their pathetic crowns can stop hunger in Africa and give them health care they are definitely criminal he ain't no king of mine and never will be Charles and claus shwab and their pals want to destroy us all and every wee own they said wee will own nothing and be happy how does that one work eh tyranny at its very best
Fake royalty ... Stolen from HAWAIIANS.. Time to give back*** Now.. AMEN***
Inbreeding has really shownn up  in this family. Icky!
He's about as laughable as joe Biden
You talk a lot but don't say much. You implicate that the general man is stupid as they do not question authority...... yet, look around you and see what happens when authority lacks! Stupidity in all it's forms is all over the world. And no, I am NOT a supporter on KC, not even British, just my few cents.
have people forgotten that our new King  married a nineteen year old virgin knowing full well he was in love with and having an affair with another mans wife,his family knew and we all knew and it did not stop after he had taken public vows to stay only with Diana in public? Then continued to humiliate her publicly,use her to get an heir and a spare and then discard her,backed by this evil family and the establishment that supports it.NOT  MY KING !
Brilliant!!  Bring forth the Guillotine!!!
I D RATHER PLEDGE TO KING---KONG😅
He is mad because he became king late in life and his son will be king much longer
SHADDAP! I'm a 76yo pensioner living on about £13000 a year, almost half of it goes on private rent. I don't have double glazing or central heating (which is why the rent is so cheap) but a wood burning stove in the main room. I can't afford logs but I get all my wood from pallets or off cuts from a joinery firm. I am on about 13 tablets a day for various health issues. I made my bed and I'm lying in it! (Lots of bad choices).  STOP WHINING AND GET ON WITH  YOUR MEALY MOUTHED LIFE!  PEOPLE LIKE YOU MAKE ME SICK!
Nasty aren't you
So what do you want instead.
F@$k Charles thinks he is  “king” But the fact is.... The “subjects” do not want to “Fornicate Under Consent of King” Anymore....  “NO ( No One) F@$K” anymore.,., This is my english and it’s KING!
I think this is very unfair. Waving and cutting ribbons can be jolly hard work.
Totally agree I watched William kiss his father if my father had treated my mother the way his father treated Diana I would have nothing to do with him sniffling creep this is why I like Harry and Megan they know the truth
I can agree with him but there’s one thing that worries me and I can express it in 3 words: President Boris Johnson
The original Charles had big flappers.Look at the ears! They are or were satanists
I have been a strong monarchist, but .... Charles Windsor is NOT good material for a king. Our government needs to be minimalist, leaving us our freedom of speech, action & belief as personal inalienable responsibility. The British Isles Republic sounds quite good to me. What do you think?
Zi-GERMAN CLAN IN UK - WINDSORS xDD
The global elites have it all figured out...The poor people worship them and grasp at every word they say...
Head of the biggest ped##o ring !
💯
You are just an disrupter yourself. You haven't understood modern monarki at all.
Windsor is total fake bs
And he isn't really English.The real King lives in Australia(I know this is beside the point but still)
Great video mate.  I'm spending today watching some Paint dry....
It’s simply the Royal Family running a business essentially and not a legitimate one at best.
It needs more and more people like this shoulder to speak out about these pathetic gangsters it's only the police and small army that keep them we're they are it will change the people of this country need to prepare for the biggest fight of there lives we have to stop this wef and Charles is a very big part of them good on you my friend
The monarchy must fall !These goons have never worked in their lives !!They stole so much from countries in collonial times !Shame on them n their  arrogance while pple have no food etc 😮😡😡
Spoken like a true communist
Anyone who is friends with the WEF does not have the publics best interests at heart........ quite the opposite.
Boo!
times are a changing the older generation are dying away and that brainwashed ideology is dying with it. The younger generation can aspire to achieve don't want to bow down to these privileged masters it's the beginning of the end plus the whole cost of living situation has highlighted the inequality  of the super wealthy and no one needs to pander to these types.
Rubbing his sausage fingers..🤣🤣
Too many royal ass lickers 👅 keep the Monarchy in place, that cash ought to be going to the poor of UK
All men are created equal Magna carta was created on that basis so why would anyone pledge allegiance to anyone....especially some freak who want you to own nothing and be happy..inbreds
🎉
Another thing is that he hasnt paid any inheritance tax!!!!!!! Wtf? Me my two sisters have bee lucky enigma to get an inheritance from sale of my parents bungalow so its worth just under 300000 if it was more than 3450000 thousand wed have to pay inheritance tax????????? Wtf has it got to do with anyone else its money that my beautiful parents worked hard fo 50years payed tax on money they earned. So how the fuck has government think they've got right to take any money off us?? Its absolutely none of there fuking business. If charles give us a share of his inheritance that be great cuz he the amount of tax hed have to pay out would be millions. They have no right i just can't believe that its so. Im getting more and more and more and more angry and upset and soon theres goin to be a cut off switch i can only stand so much of all the unfairness and injustice so when are we finally going to be able to call out all of the injustices of him and government. We need a revolution now which will be needed and just and fair. When I growing up i was taught to be polite and be respectful to my elders and taught to respect law etc i was taught a sense of right and wrong. And common sense. I have very strong beliefs and i have excellent morals and integrity.  But none of government or royals have any . How is it thT we should accept their policies when there policies are unfair unjust criminal and we have no say .if i went out and murdered someone id be sent to prison but Charles had diana murdered cuz she was more popular than all of them cuz she was outspoken but real and not a liar. She told truth so they k8lled her but not before she knocked out 2 male heirs. He used and abused our beloved diana im very very very very upset and mliion think same way as me so when are all authority government royals goin to be locked up for their crime and we install a government that speaks for us????? Its very very simple i could change the world overnight if peeps would listen to me
Spot on Analysis  😊🏴‍☠️🎈
The rebellious musicians are still here, we’re just not getting signed by labels, we’re not getting exposure. Check out a Tinkers Lane song called You Ain’t Got Nothing ✊
You are so so 100% BULLS EYE RIGHT 🙌
As an American, I have always been fascinated with your country because of its rich history and the fact that you keep your historic legacy intact.  However, I now agree with you. I still love your history but Charles is just a huge NO!  I am a Christian and I am appalled that Charles claims to have a strong Christian faith while at the same time being very active with the WEF.  The two are not compatible. You can love the environment without pushing the WEF.  I believe he is a fraud and do not trust his true intentions.
You are far too intelligent and eloquent to be in the services.
The Govt, do-gooders and "woke" activists are ensuring any people with any semblance of their own opinion going against their narrative are shut up. The whole Chas and Cam being crowned is one of them. Camilla is in a much worse position than Wallis Simpson when Edward abdicated to marry her. Wallis was a divorcee and an American he couldn't marry her and be King. Camilla though, is an adulteress who continued an affair with adulterer Charles that broke her own and Charles marriage and caused untold heartache to Diana until she realised there would always be a 3rd person. Edward and Wallis were exiled we have a former mistress for a queen. Hypocrisy. Harry wasn't allowed to wear his military uniform whilst guarding his Grans coffin, William wore his yet Harry is the only grandchild that actually served and did 2 tours in Afghanistan! Hypocrisy! Princess Anne didn't give her kids a royal title or HRH yet they are on the balcony at celebrations. Hypocrisy! Rant over!
As a fellow ex soldier I couldn't agree with you more, the Windsor's ain't even originally from Britain they are actually German
I fully agree he is a criminal a thug in a suit he blackmailed us on you tube sayin unless we agre to reset there will be many more plandemics!!!! WTF. He wants to stop us walking in the countryside in case we spoil it!!!!! He doesn't give a damn about us he doesn't share our views he i not our side .thankyou for saying just the truth
Yup  xxxx
As a Texan American Patriot, I would gladly come over and help yall free yourselves from your tyrannical leaders....
Bro…you always talk FACTS…respect…Black British 🇬🇧
Great video. God save the people. 🙏
The English are so lazy!  They like their royals because they don't have to go and vote for them.
Love your opinion and believe the monarchy are just no longer needed but the UK is totally fecked the upper class have destroyed it
😂 He has servants ironing his undies...waste of money....put them in the Tower of LONDON !
He's a globalist.  Get ready to bend over people.
God, he is SO right. What does it say about people who bow and scrape on the alter of subservience. Weak and afraid to embrace Freedom and Independence. A wretched lot that deserve everything they get, with the Fake News Media complicit in all the Propaganda as usual. Will they ever wake up?
Subscribed!
Excellent.
Ya know what you need pledge ing  for the truth  off what is right
100% behind you. You've shown just how the Elite think they're entitled to our patriotism. Sorry mine went out with the Queens death.
Australia is being lined up by City Hall for an bigger hit than Colonialism. The government is already fishing for an answer on the question of "A" Republic as opposed to "THE" Republic. We know only too well that the monarchy is keeping Australians in chains 3 centuries on. We run the risk of being hoodwinked once again.
I’m worried you can get suicided anytime now
I wonder if German is still spoken within the Windsor family? The kings primary duty is supposed to care for his people and not be loyal to some foreign entity.
Not my king and queen, DIANA IS MY QUEEN!!!!
You state that the Windsor's don't pay tax. We accept this fact. What we object to are the oligarchs in parliament, or running our politicians in the background, they don't pay tax in this country. They use offshore accounts, non-dom status for tax avoidance. Prime Ministers that we, the people did not vote for.
Joe sounds rather extreme, but it's hard to find anything untrue in what he says.  The wearing of uniforms and medals by the royals is insane for the reasons given.  The challenge for society is that we need leadership, but we have been unable to find elected MPs who serve the people instead of themselves.  Queen Elizabeth served us well as a figurehead but she didn't have the power to make laws, set standards and protect our culture. Her life seemed opulent but in many ways she was imprisoned in a life with little purpose and with very little opportunity to express her views on how the future should be shaped.  Unfortunately our failed establishment allows a select few who are able to play the system to get rich and powerful and those who support this system are fools to themselves or are content to live playing the game chasing material objects and handouts. It is  miserable system for those who want to work hard and succeed on merit alone, because the system doesn't reward that kind of endeavour.  The short memories and hypocrisy of the British people knows no bounds. Charles was an unacceptable charlatan when he dumped the Queen of hearts, but now they are happy to bow to him and behave as though he is virtuous and great.  Enjoy the coronation, I will find other things to do thank you.
WOW! this guy is one of the best I've ever seen on YouTube.
Brilliant  well done well said so true
I agree but what concerns me is the WHO WHA WEF this government will sign the Treaty.
The whole thing is a disgrace. The original side chick is now Queen there’s hope for all of us out here if the bloody mistress can be up levelled to queen of the country.😅  I just discovered this channel and agree with every single word - particularly loved the “bumbling peasant” reference. Brilliant work keep it up - I subscribed of course 🙏🏿
It’s about time people start talking about the rubbish the stand for ,I take my hat off to you bravo. I appreciate the honesty,as most you Britain’s are blinded by these money grabbing parasites ,who are of German decent by their birth right,they are Germans never have been British
100%
The British commonwealth can't claim they are a democracy, when some people are regarded as special from the time of their birth and their power is hereditary, that they are not subjected to the same taxations/regulations/laws as everyone else, the UK is just a feudal elitist society, so whenever they start saying stuff like for democracy this or democracy that, think of the ever present monarchy so you really know what is what.
Not my king
We are subjects not citizens subjects that's so wrong
SPEAK IT my brother!!!!!!!!! This is exactly who they are, time the British were educated on their reality!
Interesting, but what, my friend is the alternative.  The alternative is demonstrated all over the world.  Better the devil you know......
Tosser
I disagree that the french have good hair. The fact our leaders are monsters can be applied to any country. Its seems the truth is that war never stops and the bits that seem in-between that we call peace are just times of less noticeable war. WW3 will probably put our current time into better focus because people are alive now vs being dead.
BRAVO
“Is it theft if you steal from thieves?”
Not doing any of it , I'll be gaming all day thank heavens for Sony
Nailed it, and the week minded among us will keep swooning at this showing off of priviladge and prosperity that we keep handing to the (German descent), Royal (???) family simply for accident of birth. I will bow and scrape to none. I say that when I see a man with three testicles, then and only then will I say, "There goes a better man than me".
Not to mention hus friendships with high profile pedophiles???
Bravo sir
Great video Joe.I don't stand for the national anthem and i certainly will not kneel before anyone.The "royal" family are literally parasites. It's about time for a change and make this country a republic.
But they do pay tax, and they don't have political power..... if one is to make a point about the monarchy then it needs to stand up to scrutiny. Otherwise it's just haters doing their hating.The monarchy are an outdated and failing legacy of the time when kings ruled and led armies into battle. But criticising them with trite and untrue statements does nothing but pander to those who already hate.
How about the Romanov Solution 👏
In the uk we have people who have no religious or political beliefs,they believe in queen or king and country is that wrong?
I totally agree with everything that you have said the only royal I ever liked was diana and most sane people do not believe her death was an accident the royal family are parasites feeding off the people
This soon to be King has gone backwards in time, he would love an oath of personal allegiance, sound a bit like Donald Trump doesn't he.  My allegiance is to my  nation not wing nut.  And will the news learn to say Queen Consort.
Loving coronation day, so well loved by so many people. GOD SAVE THE KING 👑
I can't wait for the prophecy about the last king to sit on the throne after the longest reining queen in history...if it's to come true, he will have his head forcefully removed from his neck...and the monarchy will be abolished!!  They need to give backthe stolen lands in Canada to the rightful owners, and all the gold and gems stolen from Mexico, rubies and sapphires from India, emeralds from Brazil, and give back to all those families your greedy ancestors have stripped of their wealth and you and yours have benefited from...give it all back, denounce the throne, let you son take the throne and maybe society won't call for his head on a pig pole...
Freedom sounds a lot like heavy metal!
Nobodies preparing here, everywhere is business as usual.  King Charles the Turd needs to be flushed.  Break up his lands and take away the titles!!
Great thought provoking presentation.
And now they have teamed up with the WEF, Gates,Soros and the people behind Blackrock. Dutch kingdom same miserable story.
I dont have any interest in this coronation at all! This country's in a mess and its just ignored if people complain they are told they are greedy!
Well spoken. Take care. Very powerful people.
How can the British deify the Windsors at their own expense?... pathetic...the Windsors should go get jobs like everyone ...they are not gods...how the British nation decides to volunteer as slaves for the Windsors beats my imagination
Best exposition of 'The Firm' I've heard. Bunch of benefit scrounging good for nowts.
The army teaches survival. But does not teach survival under a corporate monarchy that is servant to the most noble order of the garter. The are freemasons, skull and bones, maltese cross Nazi bankers.
U hit the nail right on the head 😅
Putting a crown on that incompetent, murderous parasite is like putting royal icing on a shit: it will never become a chocolate cake.
If the King free Julian Asagne he will be King when not he is  a orderly
Jimmy savile would have loved the after party
The second Commandment forbids worship of man-made things that represent false gods
And they are not even british. Try to translate the German wikipedia because there are some important points missing in the English version:   https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haus_Windsor
Jimmy Savile biggest pedophile in the world was Charles best friend and so was Jeffrey Epstein, he had Saville supply child sex slaves
A great post. My only criticism is that the word parasites wasn't mentioned.
You literally signed a contract to KILL people you have never met ( including woman and children) for the “king” . 😂 Buyers regret ?
Time to start again with a republic. No more money stealing and paedophile royals.
Good Video bro, true up.  No loyalty to royals in Canadians but the oldest and dumbest, history is not what they sell , checkie Chuckie, hat looks too small lol
For me it was Charles himself that ruined my perception of the British Royals.  It started when Lady Diana died.  Afterwards I learned about the Bilderberg group, WEF and Davos, with Charles always doing speeches.  He lives at an absurd level of wealth and privilege, yet he wants all of us to ride bikes, live in 15 minute cities and eat bugs.
The rebellion against inappropriate kings IS a proud English tradition. The “pride” in this coronation should be examined. When the sentiment about it becomes involved, it seems oh, so strange. They promote the greatest corporate swindles. How can it be defended?
He talks fast so it isn't easy sorting through the lies and BS, ad some things.  First of all, the Monarch does pay a voluntary tax of 25%  This year Charles will be giving back about an extra 200,000 pounds voluntarily as revenue from renewable energy has been higher than expected.  Next, the royals do serve in the military.  King Charles was in the Navy, as was Prince Andrew (30 year career), and Prince William and Prince Harry.  They have a long tradition of military service.  Princess Anne has not been in the military, but she was asked to be a patron of a military regiment.  Quite frankly none of these people have to work -- they are rich enough -- but they do try to serve their country.  Princess Anne is in her 70s and still has about 5 appointments a day to meet and greet and promote various charities.  Again they don't push themselves onto the charities -- it's the charities who WANT their patronage and interest.  You call them stupid, but King Charles is a helicopter pilot, a gifted artist, an unsurpassed organizer of charity events, an expert in sustainable agriculture, and the history of architecture. He is a very intellectual person and a true renaissance man.  Princess Anne is an Olympic dressage champion and a major leader in the Olympics still today.  You don't achieve that without talent and hard work -- nobody gives you an Olympic medal.  Sorry you are so bitter about your history of empire.  Like it or not, it is your history, and changing your head of state won't change the history.  Monarchs today are constitutional monarchs who perform an important government function.  They are men and women who promote peace and progress.  I think you are lucky to have King Charles serving your people.  Goodbye from Canada.
And   yet   Harry   and   Megan   are   being   condemned   because   they   want  to  work   for   their   own   money  .
Amazing clip
Well said sir, I support your view as a New Zealand native outed from Certain jobs and progress for the future because I didn't fit the description of the white way, I formed a disheartening disstain for the q u e e n and their inbred ways
Yes gangsters....
Thankyou!  ❤🇨🇦👋🏻👍🏽
Oh jeez, heads are going to roll after this.
Unfortunately its the same everywhere in the world.  I don’t think you would have done it any differently if you were in charge
Go MAN!! It is time for this disgusting Royal family to go!
Exposing the obvious?
The Bolsheviks had the right idea about what to do with Royalty !
What I find amazing is the attitude of  local councillors who fail to get re-elected. They start whining and physically actually crying and you can just tell that they didn't want to have to go through a voting process again to stay in power. At the moment they become a councillor or MP they'd like to ban all elections. Margaret Thatcher started crying when she had to resign as PM. I saw some of the conservative councillors almost breaking down with self pity, their sense of entitlement shattered when interviewed by the media. No doubt the incoming labour, green party, liberal Democrat, etc new councillors will develop this sense of entitlement as well, as soon as they get more and more settled into their seats. Imagine what it's like if you don't even have to get VOTED into power! You just inherite all the trappings of wealth and privilege.without lifting a finger. And helping to maintain your position is a class of people, just a step down from yours, almost as equally privileged and entitled. And just a step down from them is another class, ... ad infinitum until we end up in the gutter, the lowest class. In India, they have a highly descriptive name for this class - the untouchables! Beautiful! Hahaha! Even worse off are the victims of famine, war and other natural disasters, dying in their millions, dressed in rags, of hunger, thirst, lack of shelter and disease. All the while there are church leaders, dressed in their finery, trying to convince people (like me, that don't believe in such nonsense,) that there is a god!. Yeah, there is a god! He's called MAMMON! Another name for avarice.
What a load of rubbish and lies!
Now they're trying to steal Russia !! This time   the bully gets what's due.🙏🍀🙏
No one should have to bow to anyone we are all equal  no one is better just because they have a title  & are born into money , all be it that money came by  corruption  🙏💗🙏
This guy is a hardcore anti monarchist
Yes they should live in counsel buildings and work hard I agree that we dont need these people that put themselves above the people that work hard to supply these tyrants  with the riches when it belongs to all the people the land every where belongs to us  all people
This turns into an ad for 80’s music
Wonderful!!! 👏👏👏
When queen Elizabeth took her oath to be queen .. she swore oath to " the druid ritual oath, thus being cursed by the spelling of dark sorcery as queen. The antichrist spirit....result ?;
He is very bitter, leave the country if you don't like royals, your funny
Any man that can speak the truth is a solid man! Not the girly men of today!
The name windsor was assigned, Mountbatten was linked to nazi regeme. Which is prince phillips name.
Time to wake up, dont need King or Queen, ❤THE WORLD NEED JESUS ❤
❤❤❤❤❤
Long love the king 👑 🇬🇧
Well said! However, a republic isn't the answer either. Every country needs a brand new type of governance at every level. Remove ALL of the corruption and have only people who are NOT in secret societies and all that covert BS. We need genuine people working together to make this world work for everyone.
So do you think our American system is any better?. Hell no, our Politicians are worse..Democrats and Rinos….and they put their own selves in Power over and over,,, The Clinton, Biden, and Pelosi, Kennedy Crime Families have been in power for a 100 years i know…They kill off their competitors,,,,, thats why they went after The Peoples President Trump…. Obama is now in his 3 rd term right now,,,, and if Trump doesn’t win 2024, Obama will be in his 4th term and America is over,,, Biden is just the Figurehead,,,, It doesn’t matter which Democrat they place, Obama will be the President,,,, We all hate that bstard.
Well said sir. Ole sausage fingers can do one! He ain’t my king 👑
But to give Double Down News a benefit - maybe, a Sex Pistols anthology instead along with a new perspective on Sid & Nancy
Sadly enough to say that this was absolute waste
Amazing bravery!!!! I admire you. Thanks for speaking out the truth!!! This is the exact truth, and most of us know it. But I admire people like yourself who have guts to say the truth. This world is toxic, and there are many toxic people around, sadly, and we are taking consequences. Thanks for speaking out against injustice. You are an amazing human being.
Thank you for your honesty, so refreshing to hear the truth. Amazing 😢. Tell it how it is, I can listen to you all day. They have no respect for the military, army or navy 😢. The People of this country respect and sir lute you and All whoever has made a difference. ❤🦋🦋
Fortunately Saturday is set to be a damp squib.
Mostly Bs, Long live the king 🤴
Any whom thinks is beter than a whole country is less than a whole country.
Nazi's end of.
👏🏾 finally the truth!!!
THANK YOU ❤❤❤
Wow! I never realised Charles had completed P company! 😂😂
"The monarchy is a relic of history. It needs to be pushed into the dustbin of history, and should be written about with the kind of vim and vigour that it once inflicted upon enslaved Africans, to name only one group of people it so terribly exploited." - Dr Gerald Horne
There is a group called republic protesting against the monarchy, they have a petition on their site that’s doing well considering the censorship anything anti monarchy gets.
Yeah. Let's have a nation ripping fight over what idiot or what new minority that should have the presidency every 4th. year. That'l be fantastic.😣
Spike Milligan showed him up, by addressing him as a 'grovelling bastard'.
Repatriation time!
Do tourists come to the UK because of them, yes. But tbh they are coming to look at some archaic, medieval fairy tale which THEY get to leave. We're like a bloody theme park. And until we can leave the so-called glory days behind us and actually face up to the fact that we are a small country in a big world, that is not special or exceptional, the better off we will all be. How will we ever move forward if we are constantly glorifying the past?
One dynasty that is delighted to attend the coronation is the German branch of Charles' Hanoverian House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. They will have front row seats to marvel at the continuation of England's German monarchy dating back to 4AD.
Why when talking about pay rises do we always mention the teachers, doctors, and nurses, what about the rest of us that are on half of what they get.
To top it off, their is significant evidence that the chosen one, the most powerful man in the world, aka the former Prince of Wales (Red Dragon) may well be the Antichrist himself leading us into the new world order
SPOT ON
I've been a life long monarchist but not anymore, he is in bed with the WEF, Davos and all these people, I cannot support that.
Charles was told by the head of the church to include this it wasn’t his idea. And there will be people who do so but that’s they choice. I’ve not heard anything that will change my mind on supporting the slim down royal family.
It is so sickening to me the way that people who should know better slobber all over these evil, satanic, devil's!!!
The best words I heard for a long time! Brilliant!
To all you peasants in the comments you will refer to me as Lord Chicken Stew !!
Only fools would give this nonsense in one's life to celebrate coronary if Charles as a King...21 century is also another century...I don't have time for anything that depicts evil and inequality....King of where and for who, people dying in Ukraine,Sudan,and the living costs looming every day.. Coronary of my back side with big bomb ass fart, emerging from peanut butter and all sorts of stink food.. jog on ,no time for King of Queen
I only bow to Jesus Christ. King of Kings. Lord of the Universe.✝️📿🙏
The monarchy should of ended when the queen died ..Charles and the rest of them  are not worthy…and it is 2023 not the 15th century we no longer need royals .,
Best saying I ever heard was power only resides where we allow it
Love this😊 !!
Well, have to say this was so very informative and thought provoking and has cemented my thoughts regarding these elitist squatters.
Windsors aren’t even English..Germans
Going to go through this point by point. Most viscous? Hmm, until William the Conqueror just average chieftains. Tribes needed a leader King against invading forces otherwise just chaos in defence. 100 million for the Coronation. True but it isn't thrown off a pier into the sea or given to Russia. Pushed back into our economy. I have been through the food bank myth. I earn less than these train workers. Have a mortgage and live alone.(Most people have working partners). Never been to a food bank in my life. Have you ever been to Ashford International Station? Watch the hard worked emaciated staff worked off their feet. It is a joke in the town actually. One train pulls up (no longer International ones!) five staff wander out and stand around chatting and texting. One geezer raises a flag and they all disappear back into their room to drink tea. Absolute disgrace. If they had to do my job there would be enough screaming to bring you down here, matey. Cushiest jobs going. Nurses are a different matter. Yet if you think Uncle Starmer is coming in to give them a massive pay rise you are mistaken. Deputy Labour Health Minister admitted on Radio 4 it was not financially feasible! In fact he said we cannot go on chucking money into the NHS! (All goes quiet round local election days though, eh?). The French pay the highest taxes in Europe. Now this lifestyle you are talking about in France is coming home to bite them and the economy is not sustainable even with the high taxes - people are living longer - hence they are doing what the UK did. Extend the age of retirement. (French are real whingers though). I will go a bit further later. Having a few bevvies here, matey! One thing I would say is, how many Americans visit Belgium? Probably cannot find it on the map. Why do so many visit Britain and what is the draw? Yup. Oh, and thank god we didn't elect Corbyn last time round. You weren't needed. Apparently his ambition was to not have an army! How many arms would have been sent to Ukraine by the pro-Russian Corbyn do you think?
They are the owners of England, and all the lands that Britain conquered, The King should implement your soution for him against you. You're just expressing" Malicious Envy"!!!
I don't really care whether it survives or not but I respect your opinion although I think the fat fingers are exclusive to the king because no one else in the family has edema lol
He has a nerve asking the people to pledge allegiance to him it should be the other way around and he should pledge allegiance to us the people.
I wish the modern monarchy all say, "From now on we all go to work and whole our property is given to all poor countries that the West have destroyed.  That would be so respected
Twas ever thus Ol' Bean. 👍
Every country has this problem.  Only we can decide who we will serve as our king. I serve only one Christ Jesus.🙏
I love this !!!
Last proper King of England was murdrered in 1066. Still them in charge to this day. And I'm not on about Harold Godwinson.
I think you're wrong. The monarchy is a facade, a deflection if you will, for a that little tribe of banking merchants. I can bash the royals all day long and nothing of it but mention Epstein & Co and it's a different ball game. Besides orchestrating the "French" Revolution, look what they did to the royals in Russia.
This vid got you a sub 👍
Hight of JEALOUSLY. UTTER CRAP,  at its best.
Can anyone tell me the name of the movie he’s talking about our revolution?
Absolutely love this.. u legend.. the monarchy needs to be ended
Big up the republic of Yorkshire, getting rid of England run by foreigners and getting rid of the British tyrants who made the very union with England
5:03 swapped one tyrant for another “Cromwell”
You are absolutely bang on 👏👏👏👏
0:57 French model is good idea for the politicians too.  1:31 No different from a 1000 years ago then
Privileged with unearned benefits...are they better than a soldier that face a enemy to the death on the battle field for his country? That soldier fortunately survives combat to come home and have to salute...those of privilege and unearned benefits.
Annual sovereign grant pays for upkeep of the Royal Estate... paid for by our taxes... £98 million in 2021. Then if you want to go and walk around those places you pay for, and just look at them, you pay to get in... windsor Castle entry fee - £30 for an adult. And again this is property stolen, or built on money stolen, by their ancestors from our ancestors... which the Don of their family inherited without having to pay the same inheritance tax that literally every other citizen is required to pay by law... he's got his own special exemption Law. How does any of that add up... when more children are in poverty than ever and true heros are using food banks to get by. It's the most grotesque injustice possible and yet there are millions of people who somehow associate all this basic immorality with patriotism. Talk about the emperor's new clothes.
Long live the Hanovers 😅
If he wants a big coronation, why doesn't he pay for it himself? He can afford it.
You’re spot on  The French are citizens and we’re subjects  The whole class system runs this country with royalty being top of the tree  It is everything that is wrong with this country
Brilliantly put. All of it. Thankyou so much.
Let’s hope there’s a new Cromwell
King Charles and THE ROTTWEILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Abolish the ROB ALL family!  Our good ol' Friends of Epstein
Not my king,fanesians
a very smart man with a lot of very intersting points he makes !!!
House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and House of Hanover combined.  Very British/English.  Great vid'
Well said, great pity more is not being done to remove the monarchy! Sadly many Brits believe all the BS the Royal family is spouting. Where you have an idle monarchy, you have a monarchy that enriches itself at the expense of the so-called "peasants"!
#WEFPuppet #NotMyKing
I'm not preparing for it at all.
They’re parasites.
French is good for me.
The irony is France in terms of tourism has always fared better than Britain and they know how to deal with God's anointed. But if we had a republic and a ceremonial president let me assure you he/she would be no better than anyone in the House of commons. The present way we elect our officials is flawed and will produce flawed people. So King Charles maybe deeply flawed but is he that much worse than Rishi sunak or keir starmer !
Does anyone really know what they are gonna witness tomorrow?? And the symbolism behind it ??  8:24  know what the stone of destiny is or the stone of scone ??  Does anyone know that charles has converted to islam ?  ( not saying anything bad about islam before i get slated either )  Its the symbology behind it all though !.

Fortunately, the next generation want nothing to do with monarchy. Brainwashed sheep sucking up to these royal parasites alway amazes   me.
well said an honest man
Tell the truth and shame those genocidal devils 😈 the king who had his first wife killed to marry the side chick. Disgusting Veterans in America feel the same about President's. Same family's same rules.
We the people dont need a king or a queen but the media do! When will we open our eyes and see! Prosperity and equality and fairness to all.
The Anticristh coronation
What is your reason for bringing this forever now?  Body shaming as well regarding fingers/sausages? Is it possible u can relate to tiny sausages?
Look, whoever is in control or representing a country is corrupt.  It doesnt matter if they are a monachy, a dictatorship, communistists, religious leaders, whatever.  They are all out for themselves.  So who do we have as leaders?
The Royal family have reached their sell by date and should be kicked out.
The Royals are not even of English descent. They are of German descent and they changed their name from the German name to Windsor.
Charles took his marriage vows knowing full well he intended to continue his relationship with Camilla. Diana must have felt bitterly betrayed by this and probably never recovered from it. I find Charles's action appalling,and I wonder what vows he will take as our King,and can we trust him to keep his word ?
NOT MY KING... Your right on everything you say. I was gonna comment but their not worth my breath. I can't believe what I see all those people  waiting in line to lick the royal arseholes in the hope they may get favoured by the parasitic gangsters, have they no shame.
I spent 6 years saluting this Royal establishment. It has always been an expensive joke.
King Charles the 3urd😠NO KING OF MINE 😠😠😠😠🇬🇧🇬🇧
He's a Muslim loving tree hugging melt, simple as.
Superb pal,you couldn't of said a truer word,bless you.
I loved it when this brother said " the Windsor Mafia's"........ LMAO
This man is a traitor to his country and his king. If it were up to me I would have him executed for high treason along with thousands of others who dare to speak ill of our most gracious King! 😤  GOD SAVE THE KING! 🇬🇧🤴
Well said🎉
The Royals are a symbol. A symbol of unearned privilige,  pretence and a lack of social mobility..
You talk of how great the French are so why are they always rioting and demonstrating if it's such a wonderful system, America is not much different either, there is no one who want's to level up as you talk of there will always be some one in charge who tells everyone else what we can do and what we can't do, it will just be someone different, there is obviously a lot of unhappy people in France and America, and you have done something that really annoy's me you want us to go on patreon or paypal to give you some of our hard money so you can sit at home in front of a camera and talk for a few minutes and make a nice little living thank you very much. And I know I am old and forgetful but when I first saw your videos a few years ago I seem to remember that beneath your video title it said you were sponsored by a Russian media, please tell me that's not true. And before you say anything I am not a Royalist not planning on watching the Coronation thinking of going out for the day because everywhere will be quiet and peaceful.
Omg! This guy is so real! He is so right! 😮
Royals/emperors have been parasites here for thousands of years. Same entities, different costumes. Same satanic rituals. All wore crowns, headgear.
If I ever had any support at all for the Royal family, and to be frank I never was much of a royalist, I think the Royal era ended with the Queen. The only thing I have issue with in this video is the clickbait title.
A very well made and presented video, thank you.
I like what you saying because they don't like having the royal they Cost to much  money and there is so much poverty and lack were real people can pay their heating or buy food and there  liveing on our money this is outdated system and need to be Changed Young people will not put up with this, madness because they do anything but wave and spend money there lazy,.
Charles the WEF puppeteer!
Yes it's true
Reptilian
No wonder Harry and Meghan got the hell out.
AGE  59 now  EX MILITARY  REME 207 COMMAND  BORDON 1983-1984 .  NICE to see fellow democractic sochialist  who like me woke up to brain wash off  ARMY WAYS & FLAWED COROUPT  CAPATAILIST SYSTEM .
Every word you said is true.. trafficking
Bullitt county Kentucky. Thank you.
It seems that Charles has to have his eggs at breakfast perfectly done. So until he is satisfied with the eggs presented to him, a large batch gets binned every day!
I couldn't agree more this guy is spot on ....
Feudal times are gone. Tolerated stolen valor. I believe in the USA you get jailed for stolen valor.
Travelling around the UK during Lockdown and visiting all the old ruins and country manors and reading their history opened my eyes to this exact fact. We are not tought any of the rich history of the people and the many small scale civil wars that shaped our nation. The only character we learn of is Guy Fawkes, and we all gather round and burn him every year, which speaks volumes to the levels of cultural brain washing this country is subject to and happily partaking in.
Has not "exposed" anything new, just stated some facts, history and opinions
I hear on the Talivision there was a coronation of Chalrlie The Turd and Queen Camilla , then I realised it must be a mistake  cuz they aint no drag queen show scheduled according to my booklet here , Maaybe there is the coronation of Princess Diana  who will become the true Queen of England on Sat the 6th of My , unfortunately her hubby is kind of funny cuz he talk to rocks and things , too much work killed his mind I rechon
Bold, admirable, dangerous... well done and kudos to you. Stay away from doorknobs, red ties, and suggestions you might be suicidal. Clearly, just crazy with Truth beyond the ability to lie about the common belief systems so many have been deluded into believing. Visit if you come to Texas, Salvage, Texas is safe, free to you to stay if you visit Austin, San Antonio, or just to pass through a state bigger than Germany, UK, and most of the tiny countries in the EU. Texas is my home, though born in Germany, I stay free here. Thank you for being willing to put your life, your ability to appear to the world through cyberspace, let alone society. Stay Free so the Wii, all the "I"s can provide the transparency it will take to set the future free from these crazies at the top.
Wonderful summary of these public tax-funded jokesters.  I have NEVER understood the purpose of the British RF, especially given my African (by way of Jamaica 🇯🇲) ancestry and the atrocities they committed in the name of wealth/power.
Interesting program!  It's along time since I heard any mention of the Levellers.   "When Adam delved and Eve span, Who was then the Gentleman?   Also hardly mentioned in history classes is Wat Tyler and the crucial importance of understanding the importance of class!  One can, no doubt criticize Marx and Engels for many things, but I think their contribution in that respect well outweighs their demerits.
I finally became a republican when the queen bestowed the highest order of knighthood upon Tony Blair. She wasn't coerced into doing so - it was her choice. When the most evil man in modern British politics can be treated so, it's clearly time for a change. But it won't happen. Too many prefer the stability of the status quo. That's why monarchy was resurrected after Cromwell's death...
The queen was murdered silently.
I think it's disgraceful that he is worth 1.8 billion ...but expects the taxpayers to fund his coronation.....especially with the state the country is now in...one hundred million could be put to far better use....there are many that are struggling to make ends meet and he wants his pomp....I've got no time for him....
Those rightfully outraged at the cost of the Coronation but were delighted to propagate the SCAMDEMIC which cost the tax-payer 10 times more -  driven by the same beast system.
Just ask yourself why the royal family changed their name to Windsor?
Prayers and thoughts from the BODY of JESUS CHRIST around the world.  Keep safe for we are Sojourners in this world. 🕊️🌿🙏🙌🌱⛰️😇👑👰🤴👸🏝️🏜️💪
Larpers ! Spot on !
Peaky blinders / thugs & thieves
Lovely to see lots of folks with open eyes.
String them all up ,robbed us killed us , shower of *unts Topp Man
I bet the new king will not eat bug's like they think we are going to do here in canada
Totally in agreement
The service is giving a small pitance of money and fake grinning for pics
“…Last longer than 2 years…” How to make a republic last in perpetuity is the unanswered question. First step is, why didn’t they last? Therein lies the answer of what to do differently.
The Brits are idiots to let this happen.
Thank you for your truths👏👏👏brilliant.
Get out to work, so Charles can be kept in luxury through your hard earned tax money 😂😂😂😂 Fkn backwards shit this monarchy bullshit, it's incredible that in 2023 people are still stupid enough to accept it 😂😂😂😂😂
Can't believe this has downvotes when this is so spot on.
All there jewels should be sold and given to the poor
Biggest  doleys going...
Well said
When people children babies going homeless hungry dying, and this, there's no way on this earth 🌍 will i ever stand, bow, to any SATAN'S ARMY CULTS EVIL B*,, 😡 😡 😡 😡,
Have you seen the people who waddle into the food banks sad man.
I would never pledge an a alegences  to charles  he is a woke king with alegences  to the WEF hiw about he denounces  his alegences  to the WEF  my alegences  are to god.not a woke idiot  of a king
It’s the end of the monarchy. The queen is gone now the king will fall next. Good bye forever.
My dad was LC Grenadier during the Coronation in 1953, he did his bit and he used to be a royalist, though now in his late 80s even he thinks the monarchy needs to end. Time has come to do away bowing down to these inbred elites who still deem us a their serfs.
In what way was anyone "exposed" here?
I'm so in agreement with this man we suffer to feed our kids and try and pay bills well working in two jobs and they paraded  a coronation in front off us. Bueatiful food and living in up my tax is going to this I have nothing. Its disgusting   thank you for bringing this to the people in the UK 🇬🇧
Slave masters
This guy is 100%
I used to be very pro royal a true out and out royalist, until the killing of Princess Diana, I read a book by an investigative journalist, reading to the very end it both horrified me and woke me up to the ruling system in this country. We DO NOT LIVE IN A DEMOCRACY, we are all fooled by an evil old boys regime involving the intelligence services police and Lords and other people in the establishment of this country. I cannot say any further about my anti royalism as the law of libel will not allow me to say what I reallythink, but I have nothing but admiration for Prince Harry for getting out.
Down with the King!
There is a special place in HELL reserved for “king” Charles. He is just a human like anyone else. He can go straight to hell as far as I am concerned
Robin Hood stole from the government and gave it back to the poor! Get your facts straight!
None of you would be able to do what they do, too busy to enjoy your wealth. While labour politicians with MILLIONS and time to doss and fuck about fiddling, and giving NOTHING BACK, while telling you tossers to vote for them ffs
Charlie wants the ppl to swear homage to him. WTF!!!!!  It’s he who should do that to the people
The young gen z mob, are proving themselves unfit to run a bank account, let alone, run a country… They are more than happy to give any and all rights away to unelected WEF scum?!
What a load of bull.
France and the US are in no way bastions of virtue…
It’s bloody despicable what he’s done to other people through out his life including the death of Diana , their time of privilege is going to end pretty soon and the scarlet women she be knocked off the platform for what they did to Diana  I can’t wait to see them disappear from the face of the earth it will happen karmas a bitch and I’m looking forward to her visit
For the last 70 years we`ve been urged to regard ourselves as Elizabethans, does this mean we are now a bunch of Charlies.
The royals are Germans that is why they changed their name to Windsors !
Gosh his fingers look like fat sausages ! Why? They look painful ! 😢
I always said that what Prince Harry said about the royal family was absolutely true.He was born into that hateful family and he knew exactly what he was talking about.Harry is the only one from that family to have a good heart and is honest about what he said about the royal family
Well Said God Bless you 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Well I'll be gardening.  That's what I think of the whole stinking morass
Everytime I see Charles or his father the word microcephaly (sp) comes to mind. “On your sister’s jubleez”.
He is NOT a king serving The Light.
Well put as always sir !…. Respect to you n Double Down News. 🫡
Boring
Problem being, he’s nothing more than a puppet. I don’t think it will make any difference unless we were to form a true republic minus the current oligarchs and Corporations pulling his strings. For that, I’m pretty sure the ancient laws, if applied correctly, could do just that. WE are Sovereign. Anything else is an illusion.
OK, yes they are a PART of the big system that is seeking to take away our food and our right to travel around, and yes they are torturing children for fun we now know that (30 million now going missing per year, Ukraine a major hub - that's what Putin is trying to stop). BUT just be careful not to fall into the communist pick-axe narrative and because of THEM take away people's private property and move to a jolly communist 'equality' system run by bitches like Lenin and Stalin. Don't do that OK ? We've been through that before over and over again. It's getting tired. So we need to be more sophisticated about this. Private property is the FOUNDATION of a civilized society - if you do not respect that then you are on the wrong side of history.
Lrt him who hasn't sined cast the first stone.
In your deluded ramblings you try and cite Cromwell as an example of revolution. Only to have to admit  he was a tyrant and an unmitigated disaster, I might add. You seem to know nothing of the Crown Estate, meaning the Royals essentially pay for themselves. This is all really about you, trying desperately to be significant and gain views. You use smear and slander without one single piece of evidence. Could I suggest, you get out of your bedroom and get a life?
But let's go to the bible about us respecting leaders and being law abiding citizens, does God not allow leaders to govern the country in peace and tranquility without wars and thrive as we love each other? It is written " thou shall not spread malice against the leader of your people. " what will you do if one day you see king David or king Charles in heaven?
Cromwell was a friend of the Dutch bankers... Every war and revolution has the bankers behind it: Strangely, it was after each major revolution that the country in question gained a private central bank....🤔
Excellent
You are correct its laughable The true british patriots shout inquire about and, demand the coronation of the true king of England and wales... The Plantageanets living in Australia.. Who knows if the "true king" of England and wales was enthroned. They wouldnt need to force feed crow to make the stay in the tower. Charles would end all the bad luck and infighting by just making an announcement... Abdication and the transfere of the kingdon to The plantageanets
Imagine going half around the world killing people who are less armed than you and calling it freedom
Where we're you untill today? Why blubbing now?  What a traitor!
A bucket on King Charle’s head and a mop in his hand would be more appropriate attire for a humble coronation than that ridiculous crown on his head. Let him show his love by serving the people and cleaning up the crap on the streets.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Charles is by far the bravest and most heroic English man to have ever lived. Look at how many military medals he has been awarded and that he frequently wears to remind us what a great hero he is.
Here Here ! Biggest gangsters of all. The Bolsheviks had the right idea !
Neve had or heard of food banks in the 1930 s my folks were hard up but Mums had to make ends meet,pay for a doctor or join H.S.A. TO GO INTO HOSPITAL I see young men and women drive up in their cars.and take the food  from the mugs that donate it. Get off your arses and get a job..Donthave kiddos if you can’t afford to feed them.
Fat fingered Charlie could not serve..........He can't get his fat finger between the trigger guard and trigger,,,,,,,,Would be crowned the N.D king if that .
Really enjoyed the way this was presented. FTK
As a Jamaican we want our independence ✊🏿🇯🇲😡
Here's some dissent, all the way from Scotland.   https://youtu.be/SyGAeu8aX2A
Well said!!!!!
I had a friend in Glasgow..who got really annoyed if any of his mates had picture's of the queen..king. or pope on the walls of their homes...he used to say...throw those pics in the bin and get pics of your own kids.. mums..and dads and granparents up on your walls and adore the real people worthy of your respect...i thought that was pretty good advice....still in my thoughts Billy  😊
Every knee will bow to Jesus.
Bring on the young generation! Hopefully they will vote to ban them.
Thank you Joe for this podcast, we need people like you in Parliament.
I would never pledge alliance to any monarch.They are no different to us they just have much more money.
The Monarchy are over paid, over Privilged and over pampered.I would vote to get rid of them.People are scared to put on their heating and are struggling to feed their families many living on minimum Wages.Its obscene.
His dealer must have run dry
The queen was guilty of treason. She allowed the armed forces to be used in 2 illegal wars. Harry is the only royal who has earned the right to wear the  uniform. We won't give Andrew that credit. Knowing that all the sheep gushers on the coronation day make me feel so sick is depressing 😂
Orf with their heads 👍
Okay 8 minutes into this, and I feel that the more convincing arguments have, thus far, been lost in vitriol and ad hominem remarks —Grubby fingers, Do an honest days work, etc. etc. I don't think it's DDN's finest—simply not good, measured or entirely accurate journalism.
Think I'm going to go and write another song ✌
Are we are about to lose the last real kingdom on the Earth? Oh no!
The fact is that these people are born into this lifestyle, are carried about from the cradle to the grave, and they never see anything different. They are in reality, the ultimate 'Benefit Scroungers'.   It is telling I think, to see Harry's reaction to 'leaving' the royal family.  He stated that he wanted to go out on his own, yet had absolutely no idea what to do, or how to make a living.  He has spent his time with Megan, bitching about how hard done to he has been, cadging money from his father and sueing everyone who looks at them cross-eyed.    This I think proves that when you take away the privalidged lifestyle these people enjoy, and put them in something approaching a 'normal' life, they are to all intents and purposes, useless to themselves and to society as a whole.
This video should be televised during the coronation.
Most underestimate the power of the Monarchy who give their assent or veto to every single law that passes through Parliament
Absolutely spot on !!
You are spot on.
Would a president as head of state be any better ?? Look at France for example.
ex army.i stand with you bruv
The "uprisers" came to America.
He is not my King.  Put a Crown on a Clown (King Charles) and you end up with a Circus....ie."Circus" the modern definition of the  uk with its monarchy
Elected MPs must pledge allegiance to the English monarch before being admitted to the house of commons and that includes those Roman Catholic MPs who under law are banned from being head of state under Britain's appalling sectarian laws. It's embarrassing behaviour from the "mother of parliaments"
Telling it like it is. Thank you 🙏💯
Love you! ❤❤❤❤
cockroaches will allways survive, pity
The man is a pathetic woke joke. And a friend of Epstein.
This is just meaningless drivel.
This guy is brain dead
God Bless our United Kingdom Military. They're our only true reliable  navigation stalwart.  They've seen, done,  see, do it all, but still stay true to their Oaths and  Country. 💜
Join the Diggers! Dig for Briton!
My friend, I agree with everything you have started, I am just sorry you and others had to risk your life joining the British army to uphold their rules and regulations. I am definitely going to buy your book. Stay truthful and blessed.🤟

U are Legend
I have just been thoroughly abused by some pompous old man for asking for clarification of what work the Royals actually do! My mother worked all her life, waking early, looking after her family, working two jobs to ensure her children had an excellent education at the cost of her health and free time. That to me is a life of service and sacrifice as apposed to a life of privilege through an accident of birth. It is pure elitism and exploitation that the vast majority of people seem blindly to support.
I'm glad I'm in Poland visiting my wife's family...Which happens to be very close to the Ukraine which puts the coronation and the idea of a monarchy into harsh perspective!!!!
Hear, hear. 👏🏻
I've watched this twice through now. It's therapy.
CAN'T AGREE MORE 👍👏🙌👌
Years ago visiting buck house,then walking not more than 1mile under Charing Cross railway bridge and saw it full of homeless lined up both sides. It was a real awakening for a 20year old me..
I think the passing of Elizabeth II was a missed opportunity to oust the British Monarchy.
Saxe Coburg, not Windsor. Gangsters yes!
While I can understand some of your comments regarding the history of the RF I personally prefer having a King as head of state/country rather than allow madmen, such as Putin, senile old farts, Biden or down right dangerous personalities like Trump , or Macron to hold control. The fault here lies with the British Parliament, after the death of Cromwell, allowing the return of a monarch BUT with powers and excessive property.. Maintaining a House of Lords goes without saying to maintaining a wealthy hierarchy unsuitable for the 21st. Century. That’s where the mistake lies…. 👵🇦🇺🇺🇸
Absolutely true what this gentleman is saying!!! It is time that the British Monarchy gives ALL the STOLEN goods back to COUNTRIES AND ITS PEOPLE !!!
Everyone should also read COMMITTEE OF 300 and the CLUB OF ROME, it will give you all some more insight into the DEVILS aka Monarchy.
The whole British Monarchy is a fraud. When I see King Charles dressed in military Garb with all his medals and someone who's never gone and fought in a war I see a phony and a fraud just like the whole British Monarchy is. Even King Charles brother prince Andrew and King Charles two sons Harry and William. I find it very distasteful to the real military veterans who fought Wars and wear their military uniforms proudly. The last thing I need to see are the Royal Family all dressed in military Garb flashing all kinds of metals like they were some kind of superheroes and yet most of them have never even fought on the front lines of any War. All these fools that are going to go there and be entertained by all the Pomp and Circumstance of a King Charles who is one sick perverted man. I mean come on folks you're going to go and bow down to some guy who cheated on his beautiful wife Dianna with the woman that he is going to be elected King with Camila. When I Googled King Charles and they said that he makes his Butler's iron his shoelaces flat so they don't have any creases in them, and he always takes his own toilet seat and his own toilet paper wherever he goes I mean that is one sick twisted man. Can Charles also brings his own bed and bedroom furniture along with paintings with him when he travels. And good old Charlie makes his Butler fill the bathtub exactly half full of water and the water must be exactly perfect not too hot not too cold. And did I fail to mention that he apparently also had a homosexual relationship sometime ago. Again you have the other member his brother prince Andrew who was cavorting with Epstein and having sex with underaged girls in other words he is a sexual predator for which he paid a sum of 12 million dollars to keep the woman quiet. And let's take a further look at how Great Britain from the 1700s in 1800s and they conquered India and plundered and stole spices and jewels and other valuables from India. The amount that was plundered and stolen in today's dollars would come out to approximately 46 trillion dollars. That's how the royal family was able to fight in lot of wars and take over lot of the commonwealth countries that they conquered because of all their ill-gotten gains from plundering countries like India for 200 years. And let us not forget when they conquered China and they had them selling tea 2 Great Britain and Britain got China hooked on opium. Great Britain literally made the country of China into a bunch of drug addicts and all highly addicted to opium. After many many decades the Chinese finally woke up to this travesty and kicked the English out of their damn country. And of course not failing to mention about all the commonwealth countries that they invaded and plundered and enslaved people mainly black people. Yes folks the French had it right when they got rid of their monarchy. I think they might have a few unused Guillotines in France that they could ship over to England if you catch my drift. Today's present-day monarchy in England are some of the most disgusting, vile, corrupt racist sickos that the world needs to move on from. Prince Harry was the only smart one in the family that realized what was going on in this sick bunch of bastards and got the hell out of Dodge. The Irish don't want anything to do with them neither do the Scottish and Welsh people. Maybe King Charles coronation be the biggest flop of anything in modern history. Came Charlie is a joke and so is the rest of the Royal Family and frankly there is nothing Royal about them. They put their pants on one leg at a time just like everybody else of course I mean almost everybody else accepting Charlie who probably puts on a dress and women's attire.
SHUT UP
King Charles is not my king mainly because he isn’t a King who has a heart for God.  I believe Charles is going to do much damage to us as he is part of the ‘Elite’ and the satanic agendas.  Unless he turns his heart towards God he will have a heart for himself and his own interest.  I hope and pray that he does repent and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and be Saved, that will result in a King who will have a real heart towards the people and blessings will follow.  Jesus Christ Himself said that hardly do those who trust in riches enter the Kingdom of God. (Mark 10:23 & 24)  God commands ALL people, everywhere, to repent.  That means, we must own up and tell God the Father we have sinned, thank Jesus Christ for dying in our place and ask His daily help to live a new life.  Then we can enjoy a personal relationship with our creator in this life and for eternity.  God desires all to be part of His family but there is a barrier between us and God.  We have all rebelled and have gone down our own path and to a greater or lesser amount, we have messed up our lives and those of others.  Even the best among us cannot claim to be without greed, selfishness, lust, hate, and much more.  That’s Sin.  Jesus Christ came into the world not to simply teach good things and model a good example, but to die on the cross and take the punishment for sin that we deserve so that we can find peace with God.  He rose from the dead to show that death does not have the last word.  God promises those who truly seek Him with all their heart will find Him, and He promises eternal life to those who know and love Him.  This is a wonderful hope especially for those in this life who have very little in this life, this is the only thing in life the rich can’t buy!  In the Old Testament the people insisted In having a King, and God told them all the wicked things that would happen if they chose a King when God is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords…But He let them have their way to their hurt and destruction.  But nothing new under the sun.  I may be a nobody in the worlds eyes but I’m a daughter of a Heavenly King and He has prepared a place for me and those who put their faith and trust in Him. God Himself even says not to put our trust in man, Princes, government or anything or anyone else.  He is faithful and true and not a disappointment to those who know and love Him.  I have found that to be my personal experience in all the 20 years being ‘Born Again’.🔥🔥🔥
The question is: 650 hungry hyenas, or a well fed lion? Commoners like us have no say.....we think we have, it's just luck of the draw.
#UCK THE ROYALS UP THEIR ARSES
Unemployed people get 340 pounds a month universal credit....  how can they survive ?
Until the queen died, I had been pro monarchy. Seeing how “woke” all in line are, I’ve now real concern if it is an institution to be supported anymore.
NZ is a young colonised country who became subject to the british monarchy taking our lands on behalf of the monarchy so a large amount of interior tribes produced our own kingship to stop the land confiscations . The british sent mas armys to kill/slaughter us and brought disease and weapons trading and spoiling northern tribes to come south with muskets that were never seen before and wiping out populations . They sleased there way in and now have to answer for it with money gifts and bullshit for their fraudulent activities . We'll take it as whats done is done but it smells bad . Not to mention taking our good men to war and use anzacs as cannon fodder . We will remember .
Wow! You have a lot to say.
I have felt that way for a very long time. In my opinion, the monarchy is part and parcel of the deep state bureaucracy, and archaic. Thanks for saying out loud what many feel.
You had me at the great hair. Lol!
Edward IV was illegitimate child of Richard Duke of York, therefore whole of Royal family is fake.😊
Even  After Two World Wars, White folks have Still not settled their Differences, perhaps  As they say in the West "Third time lucky" This time Nuclear will  Clear the UNclear
SPOT ON
What really got me today was watching Mrs Zelenskyy in no 10, it made me so angry 😡 Azov and their Nazi friends are laughing all the way to the bank !
Welcome to planet earth
Well said mate
I'm not celebrating not my king
Down with the crown!
Very well put together & very well said 👏🏽 👏🏽 👏🏽 love this TRUTH ‼️
You need a hobby.
Army and Police 1982-2015. No allegiances here! Not my king.
Piers,is this man trashing your monarchy?
Man you said it all.PiersMorgan,Dan Woto Tom Bower and Megan Kelly should listen to this man.Afer listening,should start fighting him They hate truth.
Shame on all the sycophants that will line the grubby streets of London waving, what flag is it now?
Sour grapes come to mind are you making money from your YouTube Chanel, because you know there are idiots that will believe you. What have you actually said?
A royal family in a precarious position is a much better place to be than a president with total power and ego. Keep the royal family feeling wobbly. Pull away at their power. But never get rid of them completely.
The problem with all the People who complain about the Status quo is that they do not have a Credible alternative. History has shown us that more often than not the Regime that replaces these Monarch's is more Oppresive, Corrupt and Vicious. The reason People can make  Videos that are Anti the Establishment without retribution, is because of our rights to Free Speech and Opinion. I do not see anything better to replace our systems and Monarchy. Shout and Scream as you might. Just look at  Russia. That is what I believe could happen here. Some Despot in charge. Meet the New Boss.Worse than the old Boss.
The Queen gave us pride when addressing other countries. And dont forget she served in the forces so have other Royals ' get a proper job is hardly fair now is it ? Charles though is not a nice man for his treatment of Diana. I don't think the royal family are needed anymore to represent our country and I do agree with a lot said in this video. However parliament was a mistake and we would have been better off keeping our King until we achieved a suitable replacement order.
I love this guy. I'm a maori we dont say this often , but truthseekers these days especially brittish gotta love em.  Get em bulldog arah arah (woofwoof)
I salute you!
Too many lies, deceit, cover ups. Too many wars, death,destruction,and poverty. Whilst they are showing off their wealth to us wealding their big sticks, Time for them all to go.
Totally agree mate I have to work all day Saturday and for once I'm happy to 😊
Oh dear oh dear what a terrible life we live in UK our sovereign is so bad  Then immigrate to China, Russia and other fantastic countries Who will welcome you all in thousands
*In English* , British  or  American They're called Gog  and  Magog *They went to* the *A* mericas, to  *A* ustralia, to *A* frica to *A* sia and now  finally They have found the Middle  East, *A* rabia. Apologies *if you only* *understand* *A* ra *b* i *c*
"bumbling peasants sucking up to a brain-dead moron" indeed! Excuse me while I go out and dress my humble home in bunting and flags to celebrate my serfdom and feudalism
This awful pantomime should have come to an end when the queen died.(or long before that) There is simply no point to a monarchy, in the modern era.
Margaret Thatcher is to blame for the Murder of Princess Diana.  She didn't like Diana or Charles. She arranged to kill her to cover up the Fake Handback of Hong Kong.  She was planning this back in the mid 1980's.  Diana was not at the Handback Ceremony.  https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/g41855732/prince-charles-hong-kong-1997-photos/  Thatcher wasn't there either.  She resigned in 1990. 7 years before the Ceremony.  Nevertheless she is responsible for the illegal handover.  Diana married Charles in 1981.  Margaret Thatcher's term as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom began on 4 May 1979 when she accepted an invitation of Queen Elizabeth II to form a government, and ended on 28 November 1990 upon her resignation.  The handback was on July 1, 1997.  Diana was murdered a month later to coverup the Media Press concern over Hong Kong to focus on the death of Diana.  The issue is;  how is it Thatcher was the key,  Authority of an illegal Handback and not the Queen herself or the Royal Family meaning Charles and Diana, and the UK Monarchy.  The Queen was not at the Handback Ceremony.  Although Charles was, he had nothing to do with the Negotiations.  Clearly the Hong Kong handback was illegal.  Thatcher had Diana killed to take the spotlight off her Handback, to focus on the death of Diana.  Also: There was, indeed, tension between the Queen and Thatcher during the 11 years Thatcher reigned as prime minister while the queen reigned as the sovereign — an extraordinary period when one of the world's superpowers was led by two supremely powerful women.  Thatcher didn't want the Queen to interfere with her crony handback making a deal with Communists.  Why ?  To coverup the fact Thatcher a claimed anti Communist, would make her a liar by Handing Back Hong Kong, destroying her Political Career and Legacy.  https://dominicjermano.substack.com/p/hong-kong-is-still-british-and-always  https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07075332.2021.2024588   https://thediplomat.com/2013/04/chinas-thatcher-moment/  https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/18/asia/hong-kong-handover-china-uk-thatcher/index.html  https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1340553/princess-diana-news-margaret-thatcher-prince-charles-self-obsessed-spt  https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-china-handover-idUSHKG18494320070601  https://dominicjermano.substack.com/p/china-the-original-invader-thugs   ● This is what the Communist do, and what they have done to me, after being invited and lured to China to teach English after losing my job the day I personally saw the 911 inside job happen in NYC.

I can't argue with what you say ..... interesting.....
Lord Mountbatten, Charlie's favourite uncle and mentor, was a proven paedophile. Good King Charlie was best mates with the notorious paedophile and procurer of children Jimmy Saville. Charlies' brother, Andrew, was a consort of paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. All just coincidence of course. Nothing to see here, move along please..............
It will also bring a lot of money into the country. Seems this young man has an axe to grind. Go and confront the king think he might like to hear what you have to say.
My views exactly (another ex squaddy)
Might be best to put all the Royals of today on the anti psychotic risperdal, high doses if needed & do marathon of Labour work like that so named Royal Mail, collection or delivery drugged on that stuff running that or the army like the work forces did, seems retribution so long as power forever diminished unto, death ?? No joke their rule, for anyone except themselves ...
And all these royal families around Europe are related too, add them into the empire aswel.....
Cromwell was a scumbag aswel,he was no hero only good he did was toppled the king.....
To the British, You can run your own country,as long as you keep the monarch's in their palaces..... you are free as long as you keep the king 😂😂😂
Out come the worms nothing like spoiling it for others

Any verification that you were in the military because anyone can say they were !!!   All i see on your Facebook  Is that you’re a Journalist that supports ANTIFA.   End of the day we should be proud to be british with our Monarchy.  Who actual care’s what the ROYALS do, all i say is people stop moaning get a job and concentrate on your selves.   Take a look at your self no one is Clean. Just a scumbag JURNO parasite.
I like ask how long was you in the army Apparently you never was in army  just Reserves  weekend  soldier can you pls Clarify
Back before the flood of Noah, the kings and queens were the “prodigy of the fallen angels”.  It’s written “it would happen again”.  Looks familiar………
From what I understand, it is actually Parliament who makes and passes laws and that Charles is just a figurehead. I could be wrong though.
Suppose they held a coronation and nobody turned up. (Other than the nobodies that are the royals themselves.) Problem is, millions are taken in by it. Tesco have a Coronation section on their groceries web-site. People want to hold street parties despite the rainy forecast. I read that 400,000 'Coronation medals' are to be awarded. For what? Being taken in enough to bother attending?
ita the inquisition. its still going!
ELKECTED HEAD OF STATE FIRST DRAINE THE SWAMP OF KLOUS SCHWABS INFELTRATION CULT PUPPETS IN GOVERNMENT THOSE BRAINEWASHED BY ELEGENCE TO THIS ROALY CABALA WHO BY NAME ARE NOT THE WINDSORS THEN HEAD OF STATE AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE RICHARD TICE REFORM UK WHICH WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE UK BUT EVIL WILL DO ALL THEY CAN TO KEEP HIM OUT
Monarchy = Mafia
Please don't hold back, Brother, tell us how you really feel.
I am not a subject...I am a citizen.. "Non but ourselves can free our minds from mental slavery"
Look at all new king's   medals  got for turning up on  the right day  .
Charles has no allegiance to the British people, his allegiance is to manmade gods and W. E. F.
100% mate. Been saying the same thing for 60 years.
Give Ireland  back to the Irish  GB is a bad joke all round the World . World  power my arse .
what f..k is he exposing?!!! he`s talking facts already known!!!! OP is su...ng dicks, title misleading.
100% agree👍👍👍
nice one
Burn it all down brother
The ultimate historical legitimacy that the monarchy has from the belief of a Divine monarchy that the monarch is a representative of god on this planet and his will is the will of God / this belief was historically challenged by the Muslim shada that there is no god except god /it was this belief of a Divine monarchy  that was the source of the feudal society of imposing that injustice on the Peasants it was supported by the established church as grew rich from feudalism
Britain has always had a caste system, gussied up to look like a class system- it began to waver after WWI, but Thatcher enabled it’s recidivism under the guise of a free market.
However, the simple fact of having an elected head of state - President for example - does not necessarily mean that the highest levels of state would be free from imperialistic criminality - France is a perfect example of this, as is the US
The King is a hereditary head of state as opposed to Joe Biden, who was placed there by marxists.  This former british soldier should just cut to the chase and say he wants a communist UK.  Everyone living in council houses. It's a shame this guy didn't learn how countries work when he served the entity which holds our individual sovereignty in trust.  It's hard to pick apart, but the man who holds the title of King has to attend hundreds of dreadful meetings and social events every year, lives in a museum, has his family life publicised in great detail and has to largely stay out of politics while shitty government after shitty government is 'elected' and told how to run the country by international bankers. The royal family is what keeps a communist state at bay.  Their authority is derived from God as opposed to Government.  Let us never have Government as the highest authority in the land.
You are a bad soldier.
I am hoping POW William and POW Catherine ascends the throne very soon after KC3. The young royals are a breath of fresh air and would really be loved by more
Why did the queen not pay death tax  Or why did charlie not pay inheritance tax  Because they are exempt  Double standards still aluve in 2023
I am Canadian and l would LOVE to see the monarchy dismantled so Canadians could start the civil freedom process as we have also been under criminal british royal family rule.
Hes a monster and who ever  Condoles his coronation is no diffrents .
Also, they are synonymous with child related perversions and abusers along with the heads of the very satanic Freemason fraternity. Then claim to be the heads of the Church too! 😂 Criminals
In one form or another this has been all over the world for millennia. The rich always clink to their power and wealth at any cost (of someone else). And it shall remain so until we all cut the greed, arrogance and pomp, even from our own behavior, find balance and respect one for another and start understanding that real happiness is when people around us are happy.
Sour grapes 🍇.
I really admired QE 2 but this crazy monarchy stuff has to end! We have the attractions for tourists without them ! let them go alone on their own ways! Those 2 princesses Beatrice and Eugenie along with their rascal of a dad, Andrew --unreal in this day and age!
Well I guess Americans, Canadians & Brits can commiserate with each other; we all have crappy ass Cretins running our countries! Lucky us...
Very eloquent, articulate and well said! Very knowledgeable and spot on! I agree with you 100% ... good on you for saying it how it is!🫡🫡
the mafia brings in trillions. every year but only goes in their indirect pocket. if you do search, they hardly make any money at all!
👏👏👏👏👏Well done sir! You speak nothing but the truth!  👏 😊😊
This king has a flunky squeeze toothpaste onto his brush, and another who checks that his bathwater is a certain temperature... He's big mates with Klaus Schwab, who wants to take away all our freedoms, with his World Economic Forum.... This king was big mates with Jimmy Saville... Let that sink in.... This king is not my king, and his wife will never be my queen...While there is still freedom of speech.. ( and there soon won't be..!), I'll continue to excersise my right to have a opinion... That is all..!
Watching this from NZ, loved it.  Charles is technically only I down here, not III.  Most of us think the monarchy is irrelevant and boring, so not much push for change.  Eventually we will become a republic but it's a bit risky at the moment.  There's a great Māori proposal for constitutional transformation based on our Treaty of Waitangi (1840 between Crown and Māori, before we brought in enough British soldiers to grab all the best land) - but us Pakeha (whites) are ready for that yet.  Not helped by our National (conservative) and Act (far right) parties'  racist dogwhistling over govt/Māori co-governance of bit of park or health service.  We'll get there, but might take another generation.
I cannot condone people like you who join the army to support the military complex . You are a fool for joining the military in the first place . . No matter who runs the nation  , nothing will change , you are d illusion  if you think anything will change  , they are all corrupt .
Great video
I'm not a fan of Charles, his a spoiled wimpy kid who throws a tantrum when he dosent get his own way . And I'm very pissed off the the fact that Cowmilla will be Queen , It was agreed queen consult . She has Charles right under her thumb. And we know they killed Diana.  Charles was not  aloud to remarry , as the future head of the church of England it was death do us part. Diana had to die so he could marry Cowmilla. Nobody likes him . I'm glad Harry got out of it and took his family away . And the firm with the help of the press and social media, has turned them into Villains  and has turned Harry into another David Duke of Windsor an exiled him from the family.  But are protecting a known paedophile the Kings Brother Andrew fucking disgusting and shameful 😕
This soldier should be arrested and jailed
Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Disgraced the fallen in the Great War that they started ,
Why pledge any thing to the German Aristocracy ,  Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. , WE DONT NEED A GERMAN KING
He was mates with Saville …….save our children from the “ Elites “.
The Exploited!!!!
Look at the invitees to the ritual of evil , these are the few who have been responsible for most of earth's current problems..Charlie's mates . Cheers
Amazing podcast!  Never thought I'd see anyone in Briton talk this way!  I hope you are a harbinger of paradigm shift there!
Yep agree
He became a Moslem!  Will be an interesting coronation...
Thank you
Gross..FAT fingers ewwww
Under no circumstances can Charles afford Meghan.
Here in America we have a constitution republic, ( not a monarchy or a democracy ) but we have become so politically correct AKA Marxist and tribalistic that we are at always at each others throats divided over race, gender so on so forth.
I think every country of the West is run by various Oligarchs.  The People don't wake from slumber because things are still tolerable.  If or when the crash comes, things will likely get spicy...
The whole royal family is SATANC. Look up Jesse Czebotar. .
Oh, dear.  So sorry you are so bitter and angry and resentful.  Thank GOD you are not the King!
Sure just look at how they protected Jimmy Saville and murdered Diana.
Thank you, they have taken for centuries ! Glad people notice and hope something will be done ! No country needs a monarchy.
Name a country without a monarchy where there isn't poverty, inequality,  division, hardship, or an elite. Why if the UK is such an unfair place with so much inequality is it the primo destination for small boats and their occupants? The number one Republic in of our times is arguably the USA and look at the situation there. The streets of Philadelphia and Chicago and Los Angeles are awash with economic migrants from all over the globe living on the streets, perishing from fentynal overdoses.  Some 8000 a day. Is that the Republican model we should be emulating?  You don't like it LEAVE.
Monarchy isn’t going anywhere… excellent for the UK, You’re a jealous commie pal, you want to steal money from people that have worked to make it and then give it to the lazy non working poor.
Thank you Joe , but how can we shift the power away from the firm and the elite to the people and have a better life for all people
Well said ❤
From the age of 12, I refused to stand for 'God Save the Queen'. I am now 75 years old.
The Royal family are evil why can’t they use the money they have been taking from poor people.
Well goodness you could always join the catholic church  maybe their outfits and gold  gowns would be more to your liking...
The artists who mock power are everywhere they just aren't given a platform.
King Charles MUST be very brave. Look at all his medals!
Charles might well think about pledging alliance to the people and not the other way around.
I take it you are not a monarchist
Your not Indian  Glee
Time to get rid of all the ones who are in control!!! Meaning all powers . No government should ever have this type of control over humanity
They are all 👿👿👿👿👿👿save the children around the world
Slave Master Puppets!! It's so over the top. All the Ceremony ritual nonsense. Charles doesn't seem comfortable within it all. They are Actually slaves imprisoned in their own system. Having to travel all over the world showing up at these events, meetings. Having to put on a smile. Even the Queen once said that she gets fed up of smiling and rather just relax her jaw lol. Omg it all looks so draining. It does drain them but they could have an easy peaceful life out of the public view and commitment but they can't. It's their role that they feel that they have to do and because even these Royal Puppets of the Third dimension matrix System are Trapped in the Bubble of fame wealth and the Ego. I actually feel sorry for them. They may have fame and wealth but they aren't as free as some are. Omg the scheduling of their daily long day routine's... No thanks , not for me.
The Royal died with Diana 😢
I will not watch that.
This attitude is superficial and indicates you have no awareness of the power and control that exists to control us
Down with monarchy! Up the republic!
Another revolution will come. The Republican cause is gaining momentum in Australia and we are due to have a referendum in the next term of government. I want a head of state I can vote for just like I vote for any other candidate, and there should be term limits for the role.   And eventually this will also happen in other Commonwealth realms too. It is long overdue...
'Doctrine of the Lesser Magistrates'... an idea ripe for today
They are a lot of obnoxious  Royal nothings a gang  almost who squelch off the poor ,People are so brainwashed if there was an impeachment, they should all be impeached and thrown out of the royal, whatever garbage there in. I don’t understand how your people could support all that garbage and they’re living off of taxpayers money so they could live like trillionaire’s well your people are starving, so I agree with everything you’re saying besides, they say king scary Charles is the antichrist.
Greetings From FISHBURN Co DURHAM 💚,Thank you sir 💯💪
Britain add a chance to get rid of the monarchy about 300 or 400 years ago and it only lasted 5 maybe less years people begged for the monarchy to get up again.
This country blundered and looted Asia, Africa and Middle East for centuries!, its time the Monarchy was abolished
There bloody n:a:z:is that’s why they changed their name. Evil corrupt blood suckers killed millions of indigenous stealing their countries, their culture and still today these indigenous peoples are still being discriminated on their own lands. Time people woke up to why indigenous peoples are pushed to the brink of society. Everything these shiny arses stripped from the indigenous should be removed from them and returned to from where they murdered and stole them from the indigenous tribes. EVIL EVIL EVIL DEVIL WORSHIPING SHINY ARSES
I salute you m8 well said
100 million it is going to cost but it is going to bring you engkand 100s of millions of dollars in Tourism you have got it so wrong
I used to have a boot leg iron maiden album with eddie killed a woman that looked like Thatcher
Did you forget that we are supposed to cover one another's faults, and that "If you don't have anything good to say, then don't say it at all?"  Charles wasn't born, or was a tiny child when India was a colony of Britain.  How can you hold him responsible for what happened in those days?  The way you talk is very disrespectful.  Why is Charles now the most wicked person when almost all world leaders today are equally as corrupt, if not much worse, yet they're not getting slandered like he is?  It's pathetic to listen to you.
Well said, all aristocrats around the world have to be taken out they are the parasites of this magnificent planet and they are the one today who want us all dead - 500,000,000 only will leave if they get away with their plan (agenda 2030) WEF / EU / WHO and the rest of them have to go so that we can leave peacefully.
If money is power and power corrupts, then it logically follows that money corrupts. Anyone. Anywhere.
Thanking you
Haha, great comment from this former solider -   "I can't say publicly that I'd like to put them to death in a macabre and excruciating spectacle in which they are dragged terrified upon a scaffold, so the spectators can drool at their terror as they dread their imminent mortal demise, cowering in the knowledge that their head is to be severed from their body in front of a baying crowd. But that is what I'm implying with the guillotine stuff."   I am very left-wing, progressive and kind! And this is why I like these sort of things!
charles  111  is  evil   and the head of the  wef   and  enslave  us   steal all our  money       he is  evil      he wants  to  take evrtyyhing  away from  us    he is the  antichrist
on a bummer. could say it about every government.
It’s been said before but I’ll say it again. Strange women laying about in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government 😂
This guy is fucking cool, i’m getting his book.
Spot on and well said !
A Reaist. More people need to wake up to where Charles and the WEF are talking us all.
I won't see any of it ❤
Sue Townsend wrote a brilliant book 'The Queen & I' about the monarchy being deposed & living in a council house.  Also, one of my favourite tv series is House of Cards starring Ian Richardson.  In the middle part of the series 'Finessing the King' Michael Kitchen portrays an unnamed king (who gets royally shafted by Ian Richardson as Francis Urquhart) & he is Charles to a T...totally inept, woke & a failure.
Treason !!! get him Hanged
No good king
It would seem that to be obsequious to those richer, 'better', is part of the British genetic makeup. In any event, The Moving Finger Writes, or history moves on, and the little UK, devoid of natural resources and without colonies to exploit, and having left the European Union, is slowly but surely sinking into poverty and irrelevancy. Tourism will be the only "industry" left. Interestingly, I Googled French tourism income v UK , and France earns 2.5 times the UK. It appears that tourists will always want to see stately homes and castles, with or without their occupants, so why prop up the occupants to the tune of 87 million pounds a year?
When the queen passed the Monarchy should have been desolved,right there and then.Its a waste of people's tax paying money,it needs to stop.Too much fanfare at the expense of the people's money
Yes what do you do for the people  Well said ,really look what we have coming our way ,really look at all  parliaments
Of course they are gangsters....this is an entire family of people who live off the tax money of the English people. There are poor struggling people in England but these people live in palaces wear designer clothes have the best medical care don't need to have a job, have 100% power, have no fear of anything .....don't worry about paying the bills......WHY IS THE MONARCHY STILL ALLOWED TO EXIST? this is a terrible thing for the English people.
You Brits and Americans are so woke. Take it for fun and joy. It is an old tradition. Not forced upon anyone. Take it easy.
I just don’t get why anybody would care so much about the monarchy to have it abolished - I always have the hunch that those people are envious deep down inside - then again I agree with them that there’s not much to write home about as concerns the royals, they’re all a bunch of mediocre nitwits
Seems the people against it re always the most angry and aggressive types.  If it was a new concept maybe but considering the country has never been anything  other than a monarchy apart from a brief period in England for about 20 years under the very enlightened republic that was so great it lasted....  And the name of the country is the United KINGDOM it's deeply ingrained into the British psyche.  In a age of multiculturalism and everything else British has been destroyed at least give us our last connection to our history and what we are known for throughout the world.  It's not perfect but I'd rather have it than President Johnson or President Blair moving into Buckingham Palace.  There's literally not really any point in that.  If u look at all the dictatorships at least a King is the last line to this country ever becoming one.  Actually the Queen and now King perhaps would be more popular than the current lot of idiots in Westminster to rule the country direct.  When more and more of our freedoms are being taken away censorship is everywhere and free speech isn't allowed anymore.  It's time for the King to do his job and step in. The Bible says a JUST King who loves his people and honors God is the best form of government.  Heaven is a Kingdom with Christ as the King.  Unfortunately power corrupts and human beings are all sinners so they are few and far between but I dont see how a president would be any better.
Right on my man! Paramours, concubines, philanderers, thugs of bygone era celebrating and living lavishly on tax payers money.
Well said and very well put together video .
You’re incredibly well balanced
This is a rant not an exposure of anything.  Your comparison with France has to be comedy!  Thank goodness you live in a country that has the longest tradition of free speech in the world!
306k views in ONE day Amazing, keep up the good work friend.
Right on my man!
Defund the royals give the money back to the people they are useless parasites
I won't be celebrating no wicked coronation there all puppets to push the agenda.
I expect royalty to be useless and entitled ...in this way, in not upset in anyway when they turn out to be useless and entitled and I can get on with my day unhindered
Hundred percent agreement, including the small coffees and whispering in French.
Ohhh, You wouldn't get along with RIVER, a YouTube channel Commentator, who usually comments on Meghan + Harry, AND on some broadcasts, PRAISES the Monarchy. DO AWAY WITH THE MONARCHY? Good Heavens! What would One do without those who CLAIM to SPEAK for GOD?  Watching BREXIT, years ago,I saw the House Of Lord's Laugh at the notion of LEAVING on the set date, knowing They'd THWART it, kill business ready to go on set date, then purchase businesses that failed to launch in set date. It's all about getting in on the ground floor of a Ponzi scheme, sort of thing. THE ONLY FOOLS WHO DIDN'T KNOW BREXIT WOULD BE DELAYED WERE THE SIMPLE MINDED Honest Business Men  who believed Parliament Representatives  Every day BREXIT was DELAYED, the House Of Lord's bought out a few more BANKRUPTING BUSINESSES. SMART. RUTHLESS. EVIL.  THE TRUSTING SIMPLETON BRIT, FELL FOR THE LIES OF LEAVING ON TIME.
Spot on!
very good video thought provoking don't mind scaling them back dramatically , but what gets put in place? a President , so we swap this lot from say President Boris? then we really have to ask what power would he or she have and how would we get rid of them? as   Tony Benn once said , if we don't know , then we need to know !! and fast also would a president be less corrupt ? I say not a chance in a million would they not be and the UK voter always gets it wrong , one less thing to vote on hate saying it but probably good , we make a mess every time, so do I want change YES do I want the Royals ? depends on what, but if happy with the model to replace them then I would give it a very serious consideration and would more than likely vote them to go , but it's not a forgone conclusion.
Yes let's have Tony Blair for president!  What about Gordon Brown?  Boris.  Sunak.   The choice is endless.  Let's have a republic, damd if we do, damd if we don't. There is no one to lead this country.
The only reason these new anti protest laws were rushed in was to stop any republican protests,normal service will be resumed at 11.59 p.m on Saturday.They have their sausage fingers all over this legislation.
Queen Elizabeth had tradition and stability. Charles? Buffon who couldn't even hold together a marriage to a beautiful hot woman and rejected her for some hag. Couldn't even hold it together for the sake of his kids. How can he lead anything or be an example for anyone?  It's time to hand the reigns to a member with integrity (Anne) or ditch the monarchy.
Expropriate the estates, immediately.
Spot on. ATVB
Real talk!!!
You should be ashamed !! 😢
I like a lot of the ideas and arguments made in this video but the point made about Oliver Cromwell really overstates his care for the people and the effect it had and also makes it out that all history courses taught around the country are the same which is incorrect I personally learned in detail about the history of Britain good and bad not censored in any way with mentions of revolts by the people being front and centre in my course.
Oh buzz off.  Better a king than  dictator
They are the biggest thieves
Don't forget the troike of reactionary kings that stradelled Europe all related, English, German, Russian. The Russians had the good sense to terminate that line, better late than never, releasing the productive and creative powers of their people to modernise and within a generation to put a man in space.
Zero facts, narrow perspective, can’t see the bigger picture and therefore your only use to society is jug head cannon fodder who couldn’t even see that through. Elected head of state would be Etonian, investment banker leaching of the hard working public and actually they are the land owners that want to squander our countryside, just look at what happened in Dartmoor recently. Sorry guys but you are way off the mark in this one
Are those medals for every kid Jimmy Saville supplied.
I dare you. We'll see what happens.
May Chuckie fall at the hands of all the muzzies he's brought into the UK.  Poetic Justice!
Are you jealous
Now you have dumped all other England and everything we stand for, when are you going? Which banana Republic are you going to live a better life in?
I gave up watching because all I got was a whinging Pom. Give the guy a chance. He's cut a lot of the expense of a coronation and he is right for getting back to basics which goes against a lot of profiteering corporations. As a King he has little he can do to the Govt.
Crowning Charlie is laughable. God Bless ❤️ 🙌 thankyou Yes a Mafia firm and people don't seem to realise they are being used
I don't think he's rubbing his fingers with glee.  He clearly doesn't want the job.  I'm not interested in this coronation btw and agree with most of this video apart from how it portrays Charles.
Nobody is asking you to swear your allegiance to him as for this man your a disgrace to this country and your wrong they do pay tax this man needs to get his facts right before opening his mouth .
Just found you, now subscribed. Don't go through any underground roads. Hail King Tampon 1st.
He is going to destroy the earth hes the bibles antichrist
...ΜONARCHY..IS THE MOTHER OF ALL EVIL....
Yes but he has royal blood. He is chosen by God to lead you. 😂
Sack em all and well said son👍
That with the rothschild Cabal who call themselves The Crown.  Charlie the child molester abdicates after a few days to become the chair of the Crown.  It is all fake.  Never forget the thousands of children slaughtered for adrenachrome.  As Putin said. 1 bomb, and the UK is gone.
I think it’s disrespectful of Charlie wearing all those medals of entitlement twats never fought in a war and who the hell came up with the idea of medals of position and entitlement to make him look good what a joke and disrespectful to all that have served in the army having pledged allegiance to his mummy. Doesn’t help when all these xxxxxxx line up waving their stupid little flags bloody rich folk
the country has turned its back on us the British people for new incomers, hence why us loyal patriots have turned are back on them.
Im still trying to understand how worshiping the family that conquered us... and has used us and our ancestors to enrich themselves for nearly a thousand years...is in some way "being British"...our ancestors must surly be turning in their graves.  Get off your knees England.
I'm surprised I'm not entirely clued up about the history that spawned 2 very well known bands ,New Model Army and The Levellers of course.I'm guessing GP surgeries will be closed again like for the queen's funeral.Shameful.Then they complain about strikes within the NHS an institution that has only just recently pulled us through a pandemic.Again.Shameful
Name rank number please soldier. So we are clear.
But I like my tiny coffees. I don't feel that makes me a class enemy. The English are so driven by class envy - I don't blame them, the set-up is vile, you are right 100%.
I was a monarchist. Until this t@mpon king & his adulterous mistress from a long line of royal wh#res came onto the throne. Makes me sick.
CONTROL OF THE AIRWAVES IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN GUNS.  POLITICIANS ARE DECEIVING AND BEING DECEIVED. THE WORLD WILL SOON BE RULED BY THE ANTICHRIST. HE WILL REQUIRE EVERYONE TO TAKE THE MARK NUMBER OR NAME OF THE BEAST ON YOUR HAND OR FOREHEAD OR  BE DECAPITATED. ASK JESUS INTO YOUR HEART WHILE YOU HAVE THE TIME.
Not my king.
Sadly, not bright enough to understand the position of head of state. We don’t want faded politicians taking turns to be “President of the UK”, lining their own pockets.  Soldier, eh? But not an officer, clearly.
it is time to rid us of the monarchy . he is part of the iluminati and a wef leader
Still calling him a "king" aren’t y'all? Why not call him by his REAL name which is Charles Windsor, or better Coburg-Gotha, to acknowledge he’s a pathetic human being like the rest of his disgusting followers
Everybody should appreciate their own lives on this planet and stop winging about the monarchy which is pretty excellent.  What would you really prefer the replacement. Think about it.  Careful what you wish for 🤷‍♀️
Protected Jimmy Savil and Peter Ball... Both peado's
Animal farm in real life
Loved that explanation of royalty. I have kind of ignored them mainly but blindly accept them for patriatism sake. These days it has been clear that there is nothing to be proud of with any state controllers and on every occassion it is us that have been used and abused for our patriatism. I believe we ought to be patriotic to the people of our country and enemies of those that abuse the loyalty of their citizens. Very good no holding back video. Loved it.
The most bizarre thing is when Kingdom lectures all around the globe about democracy
I worry about the oath he will take.  If it has been altered to diminish his responsibility to us.
We are ALL better served by a Constitutional Monarch than an elected nobody.  Who is the Head if State of Germany, Eire or Italy - and I don't mean the Prime Minister, Taoiseach or Chancellor?   And what if, by popular mandate, a Boris Johnson, Jimmy Savile, or a Vladimir Putin were to be elected as President of the United (not Kingdom) of Great (really?) Britain and Northern Ireland?  It's now estimated that over £1 billion has already been generated for the UK by the Coronation - that's a decent payback.  So I'd rather have an imperfect but benevolent Monarch with no constitutional power, who recycles everything (including the coronation robes, chairs and flags) and hates central heating, than see a President Fat Cat ex Politician being driven to his or her "enthronement" in a bomb proof limo accompanied by 20 armoured police cars plus 30 outriders.  Besides, the newly installed President would hardly live in a townhouse in Mayfair, and judging by the tastes and habits of other Heads of State, they tend to like living in the odd Palace or five.  And if the Monarch were to be displaced, then no doubt there would be a huge furore about the legal reversion of the entire Crown Estate.  Or would you prefer to confiscate everything and throw the entire Royal Family into the Tower?  Or exile them to the Isle of Elba?  Or chop their heads off?   Think about the consequences before ranting republican bile, because no matter how much you dislike "privilige" and pageantry, I'd rather see my Head of State receive the King of Spain with appropriate protocol and in corresponding dignity, just as we'd expect our Head of State to be honoured overseas.  After all, status, pomp and dignity go hand in hand, the UK is the world lead in ceremony (like it or not, and if so, look the other way)   Some ex pop star in a wig and purple glasses might not fit the bill, no matter how popular a singer he or she might be.  As for a failed Politician as Head of State.... name one desirable candidate.
THE MONARCHY CAN QUITE FRANKLY EFF OFF
Power is destructive. HOW EASY WOULD IT BE TO HAVE EQUALITY AND ENOUGH FOR US ALL. ¿¿¿¿The earth's crust in ratio to the size of the earth is equivalent to the skin of a soap bubble and we will all go pop due to the greed of the privileged few people who are making life difficult for us all and destroying the earth in the process of getting rich and reducing the population starvation, homelessness, war, etc.......... Not a man among the lot of them, morons in Saville row suits.

I wonder when we will see a political party or rven a single politician advocate for post scarcity society driven by automation...
Two words: Jimmy Saville.
What kind of fairy tale do you want to live in? If we don’t sell it, someone else will.  Do you know why the British sell arms to these dictators? To keep those dictators on a leash. To make sure they don’t use those weapons to go against the interests of the United Kingdom. Imagine if Russia sold weapons to a middle eastern dictator and those weapons fell into the hands of dangerous terrorists… Russia wouldn’t stop supplying them, because they don’t care who ends up getting those weapons, as long as they make their money they don’t care.   So those weapons Russia sell to the dictators is making them money(money that they use against the west) and its directly threatening British interests in the area(bolstering enemy groups). Every country is fighting it out day in day out. And I refuse to let my country down by trashing our monarchy.
Elected head of state no thank you, young generation of today have no respect, WOKE culture also claim to be victim of some sort.   Thank god WW1/WW2 happened when it did as this lot today would be offended by Harsh Word’s. weak mentality.
There is always one wanker that will let the side down! And here he is!
Fake Soldier more like. guy literally has no clue,  if he had actually served, he would know that the royal’s, are none stop working, royal engagements around the world.  Also no choice of privacy. Do us a favour mate piss off to France if you don’t like it. (( this is an occasion of bringing everyone together ))
If the crown falls, so does Britain. People will lose interest in Britain and will stop coming for tourism. The French are known for their wine, the Americans for their burgers and we are known for our royals.   Its not about what they do for the country, its about how successfully they have represented the country over the years, despite all the drama. People are interested in the rich heritage and amazing way of life of the British people, no monarchy means no more ceremonies, no more excitement and no more Great Britain.   I can understand your frustration but without the crown Britain will be surrounded by packs of wolves who the crown have fended off for years. The world is undoubtedly controlled by psychopaths, so you better look after your own psychopaths, otherwise the whole world will try to destroy this beautiful country. Don’t give our enemies hope by making videos like this. Support the crown support the country.
An "elected head of state", er, like Merkel, Macron, Trudeau Adern, Varadkar etc? All WEF.
Do us all a favour - Go and live in France.
Time to address pomp and ceremony and royals 🌹
You hit the nail on the head with just 2 words......."fundamentally wrong".
They are beggars living on a luxurious social security  from birth to death. Grotesque remnant from the past
Brilliant stuff
Someone’s angry
But they have such tasty boots?
He didn’t expose anything, he just whined
you have not exposed anything.
This is why they (the powerful rich barstards) over many years have stopped people having firearms. So that people can no longer protect their lives, their family's, their homes, their freedoms and their rights. Does anyone truly believe that the s**t we have had to take would have even been put forward and made law, taking away our rights & freedoms, if every one had an AK 47, mags, ammo and training to use it, if they needed to? My answer is no! We would still be a free nation.
Is it theft if your taking it back from thieves what a wonderful phrase.
Who knows what film the movie clips were from?
This is the modern world? Democracy does it exist these days? ….it just don’t even more so these days me thinks?……. Why? 👍👊🖖🫶✌️😎
Im against Britain become another state of the USA. Be careful with your ideas
We need to look at the power behind the power , in who’s interest is it to keep royalty going.there lies the problem and the solution.
Britain needs more people like you 👍
The main problem is the the elitist class system it creates .
Those people are just not educated properly, they only have etiquette rules
IK people are haply to be treated as modern day slavesbowing in obedience to the sex predators and money laundering charity scamming monarchy
Well said
Sometimes people who do nothing but want to mean much think it's just the dress that they need to put on to become really important, in reality they become only trasvesty or clowns
They disgust me.....they need to go
Can you please give a definition of what a proper job is.
Oh yeah like now ,french are really living well as we all see on the news , macron is really listening to the people we can all see how that is going on TV ????it's not riots then !!!just celebrating how good life is in France ???
Well done they are the mafia off uk
When the queen passed away I was hoping that the monarchy would be no more they must be the richest family in the world they have the best of everything they’re kids all are privately educated they want for nothing why are the taxpayers paying for the coronation they have money coming out of their ears they could and should pay for it themselves KC wants us to pledge allegiance to him and his heirs he must be joking I wouldn’t trust them as far as I could throw them
Totally agree
A former terrorist
What people like this don't say is that the King now owns Great Britain and everything else that his mother owned before him. The royal mints around the world are his and the wealth of the lands are his too.   He is the richest man in the world and his lands should pay for him in every way. The owner of Tesco does not say I'm minted now I don't want any more money. Why should he?  He could use his councils and retract the land tax on your home and throw you off his land.   He is the divine ruler very soon through his coronation and Long live the King.
The Windsors are Socio-engineered fake royal family by the Rothschilds from centuries ago. All the royal families around the globe are fake.
FAT FINGERS CHARLES IS THE HEAD OF THE W.E.F AND 💉
This bloke hasn’t been to france in a while clearly
Superb
Hebrews 4: 12 - 13
This guy ran out on his pals. Not to be trusted
Well said...they are parasites
This man should be running the country. Genius that speaks the truth.
Just go to operation paperclip images Bidens in there
Marlon Brando was a paperclip Nazi
Only the false beLIEf in "authority" allows this great evil to continue to enslave and rule us.    Just stop believing.  It IS that easy.  Stop obeying.  Stop complying.  Reject their Archon control system and return to Source.
I couldn't give a fuck about any royalty..😭😂🤪
i'm sad to say i was born here, 100% agree with you.
Your so right
The queen's funeral was also the death knell for the monarchy...
There an operation paperclip group impersonating the mob for wit sec Rudy set it up and Ricod  the real.ones to do it
Lizards, the lot of them
Irrelevant, useless and generally fairly thick, is this what you worship ? good luck
As every power, they are a consequence, the problem comes from the humans who allow these “elites” to  fucked us up all the time, giving them their  vote or being convinced by shallow words. This is a world that belongs to the 90% of brainless uneducated parasitic humans, who take normally the wrong decisions, hence the destruction of life on the planet.
I feel extremely privileged to have had the Queen in my whole life BUT, Charles , , , Hmmmmmmm
Agree 100%. These royals have been “raping” people - economically, politically, sexually, etc - for a millennium and beyond. They expanded on colonialism more than any other group in the last 1000 years, all for the purpose of riches. Millions died as a result.
Well said, you hit the nail on the head on all points
Nob head
Why are we not rising up and coming together, they can’t throw us all in prison they would have no wages 🤣
Then we have thicko Harry who doesn't want to work as a royal demands police protection officers (his word's because it's his birth right) suing the government, and demanding HRH status for his children. These Canadians , American Australian etc coming over for the coronation don't have to keep this family of parasite
Hear hear!!
👍👍👍
Well said
It's absurd. We're a democracy with an unelected head of state. We're free citizens yet also subjects. We're supposed to be equal yet one of us sits atop a throne. Supposedly served by royalty and yet reigned over by them. The Monarch isn't just above the laws that apply to us, they're written into the fabric of it. And the biggest joke of all is that this bloodline of medieval dictators get their right to reign from an ancient middle eastern god the vast majority of Britain doesn't even believe in.
And yet…… the ills of your society can be laid at the door of your leftist, socialist government(s) specifically and generally your political class.  The king/monarchy is but a symbol of what Britain used to be before the advent of the career politician.
Spot ON!! END THE MONARCHY NOW
Uff wiz de eds!!!!
Prepare for the REAL King Yehoshua Ha Mashiach (Jesus Christ)
He is there by chance and through his ancestors and others sleeping around.Sounds familiar.A waste of money and he is a schwab puppet.
theres a few comments from ex-servicemen/women who have encountered the daftness, a pause for thought for all the commonwealth countries, if your Jamaican etc, the military still swears allegiance, to yep, the magic hat. they cannot be prosecuted, its the crown police service, the crown prosecution service, the royal courts and the royal judicary. This week ive had welsh police on the mall trying to direct me to never never land when i need to get little st james and knightsbridge, nobody got a clue, whilst Charlie boy probably wearing the socks i delivered last week. unreal.
And Charles is stupid! Inbred
Satanists and parasites.
Thanks to Albert Einstein we now know scientifically that the universe (one song) is made at atoms etc.  The electron, proton and neutron float in a substance called Spirit – we are one with the Creator.  Jesus said the 'Father and I are one, but the Father is greater than I", meaning it was in him and everything and everyone else.   Therefore there is no one better than and no less than me.   Being a King r Queen no longer means much sense when you know the truth.   But then, 'When we seek the truth the truth will set us free"   Love it.
Just remember that the Queen and Prince Phil visited an indigenous place for children in Canada, where she took 10 kids for a picnic and those ten kids were never seen again. The truth is coming out about this freak fuck family who’s sexual tendencies are shacking up with dead predators in New York and many stories of child sacrifices. Typical of the public, they lap up corona-tions.   Remember, they killed Princess Diana.
Just found you bro! You’re amazing! Thanks mate.
Charles WILL be the last king of England, it's been proclaimed.
Yeah they are violent ☠️ 🏴‍☠️ pirates ☠️ from centuries
There's only one king in the whole Universe and the whole world 🌎 and planet earth and all planets of the Universe and in every realms .. only God our creator is the King of Kingdom of Heavens and on earth 🌎
He visited ep stein island many times. The flight logs prove it.
The monarchy collapsed after the passing of the queen, she was an amazing human being that dedicated her life to be diverse and excepting. Now we have a blithing king and his bit on the side that don't understand the people of today. The Queen mother in ww2 gave people hope in dark days, just like Elisabeth gave n.ireland with  her speech that brought two communities closer, speaking in Irish and recognised that everyone was hurting even though mount batton was bombed
Normal people struggle to manage daily and this reptiles squanders millions on one day think about that to put a helmet of diamonds on his jug ears head .yes you are right soldier
There is only one King. His name is Jesus Christ. Our government and Kingdom are not of this world. A time when we were advised to follow government though not in a time when satan has compromised each western government for a certain religion of peculiar people raising a globalist babylon. History is truly important as it show values to fight against royalists, gives us a backbone in refusing to be yoked by government, gives us truth to the things which they aim to hide and exposes all enemies attempting the same actions as committed before. They be the type to chuck their own into slaughter all to regain sympathy from blushing faces of embarrassment  as they claim to be chosen and "holy" and have been compromised, just as all the west. if balfour could see what were to happen, he wouldn't have signed.
Hopefully he will not last long like his ancestors heads loped of cursed name Charles no one likes him really except Muslims ?
Charles is not the queen, the queen was respected by all, the new king has been on everyone's hate list for years. He's too liberal.
Lets be honest if there was 2 brothers living on your street and one was good mates with a known pedo ( jimmy Saville) and the other was known for knocking about with much younger ladies they'd be getting their door kicking in, but the royals get a free pass . Right bunch of wrongens
This makes me so angry if you don’t like British way of life immigrate no one forcing you to stay here people trying to tear down hundreds of years of tradition
get rid of them all
Perfectly said 👏
Over many years  there has been thousands and thousands or non uk residents  coming in to the UK and theses are mostly the ones who where at Harry's wedding/jubliee etc. Is this why they opened the gates so the royal family has more support as most of the British lost instrest in them. I remember  when Diana past away they were close to losting the monarchy  and they hide camilla away out of the public eye and the last few years she's been in the media and then when the Queen past away she become queen corest ( how ever you spell it)  and now they have said she will become queen.  Most people I know said they are happy to have a bank hoilday but if they had to work then they would be happy to. My point it the general public forgets theses things and the royal family/ government etc  just pushes  until they get what they want.  Rant over
If you don’t like the way we do things here, you are welcome to leave

You are a brave man...
I don't agree with this artistry of professions holding the nation to ransom for pay rises.  I see nurses every day, and doctors as an example, they're not starving. They've got beautiful houses, large over expensive cars, their bodies plush from copious amounts of food. I see nurses at the Chinese Nail's stalls paying £30 and way more, every time simply for fake nails, buying alcohol and going on fancy holidays and living with the newest latest household technologies. No, it's all a an illusion in many  ways. None of these people live in poverty. What the issue is, these people overspend, indulging in personal fanciments for pleasure and money seems to be no limitation to them. Why do train drivers and ticket tackers need with pay rises when all they do is sit and drive a train or walk up and down isles asking for tickets. Why is that hard work. It ain't. I was in a hospital, one I'd never been in before, and all I saw were nurses, fat, small and dumpy. Never starved a day in their lives. Outside these same nurses driving away BMW's and one had a huge Discovery .. Hmmm. Perhaps they should get a small runabout and stop indulging avarice ... Having  mortgages for 4 bedroom houses and AVE smaller homes more affordable and within their means.   People overspend, I see every day. Nail salons, beauty treatments, over indulging in fancy cars and holidays, copious amounts  of fizzy juice and biscuits and crisps  and cakes in their shopping trollies. Other types of candy and sweet goods instead of buying actual food for their  families ..
PLEASE do something about that horrendous clicky music, it absolutely ruins all your content... I'd happily subscribe to your patreon model just to have that stupid, irritating music removed... it adds nothing whatsoever to the messages you are trying to get across, I just have to turn off most of your videos before I reach the end because of it... the droney pads in the background are bad enough but those clicky hi-hats are just appalling. There is no reason for it to be there... it doesn't add drama or anything like it, it's just nauseating! Otherwise your videos are some of the most informative and interesting alternative news items out there. There's no reason to dumb it down on the assumption that people will tune out if there's no music there. It insults the intelligence of your audience.
Yet you joined the army to kill people effectively

What I find distasteful is Harry and compassion he receives from this King...  This is all so unfair to the British people. Harry has attempted to destroy our entire institutions along with his woke, racist wife and he's still being patted on the head and given gifts and special treatment. How is this any role model of our future King to weaken to this disgusting person. It's not good at all. It's our nation too, not just belonging to a king. We should be given a national voice against this - its unfair treatment. No wonder our government is weak and pathetic. They sit back an accept this creature no matter what  damage he's does instead of  taking his lying a*s to court instead of bowing down to him.  By doing so is our King admitting all the guilts for the accusations and speaking for us to stop us having the right to do something about it... Why are we silenced on TR his matter. Is it a subversive pattern concocted by all Royalty to sway the opinions of British people into becoming not only woke but accepting so-called, embarrassments and admittance to the past for slavery the British stopped around the world...
Did you all have a Magna Carta in your history, too?  I thought that was pretty significant: the barons demanding rights from the king.  I hope you get your revolution soon.  It would be nice to think that there might be a big change by 2066, a thousand years after the Norman Conquest,  and that Anglo-Saxon values of equality might finally triumph over Norman French values that have oppressed Britain for too long.  Because I think that's where your oppression really began, in 1066.
You took the oath matey!  Guessing you missed the bit about heirs and successors.  Did you assume Her Majesty the Queen would live forever?
Do the royals act as a useful block to prevent the rise to governmental power of a dictator?
Off with his head 😂
I have had an inherent loathing and disgust for the monarchy, even as a small boy. The problem of speaking out against anyone with power is that the followers seem to get quite annoyed and angry. As with the royal family if you say anything against them, some people would think of you as unpatriotic or a traitor or  a rebel and look at you like you have shat your pants. There is a slow revolution gaining momentum and we must stand strong and fight for what the majority want not the rich minority.
This is a monarchy of globalists. NWO lizards, 15 minute cities ambassadors and the great reset masters.
Lizards
I am south African but my fore fathers are Brittish. I think you are spot on . Well done.. this DISPICABLE  person does not derserve to be  or is Fit to be King. A whole M Nation has to fork out millions  to endorse  Him at a coronation and bow down to him being crowned in a church  (of all places) as he is Anti Christ! So what exactly are they trying to prove  or who they  trying to fool?.  shocking .. there are starving people in this world and the Brittish just throw away the money after a clown . Im hoping & praying no one  of the Brittish public omes out in support of this "Coronation".
Isn't Charles and Camilla second cousins and Queen wouldnt let them breed due to incest😮
YOU KNOW NOTHING of the royal family, I am not a fan of Charles but I loved his mother.   You are just jealous of Charles,
Spot on and straight forward talk on the fascist monarchy. People that still support the monarchy in England are brainwashed 🐑 sheep.
"British Royalty" =  lizards and Satanic Pedos - most all WW governments have been ruled by pedos.  Their time is coming!
Just another socialist rant
I wont be watching the Coronation its a ritual after an eclipse and on a full moon👹👿
He isn't exposing anything. He is just giving his opinion on what we already know.
Do you think politicians want equality?
Waste of oxygen all of them I’m not surprised H wanted out good for him
I'd like to know this man's opinion on the anti-white bollocks that's been going on with our military
I've stopped voting... Lost faith in the system and they may wear different colours but they ALL sing from the same hym sheet 😔
It is what it is. You want to really sort things out. Take out the civil servants. They are a huge problem and have a say in absolutely everything.
If King Charles was african and head of state of ZImbabwe, we would be calling him a despot.  Instead, because he is 'British', people in this country worship him and the family.  People living in poverty, "arn't the royal family amazing?"
100% agreed. Well put and glad I’m not the only one feeling the same
I would love to get rid of the monarchy but don't want it replaced with a marxist state.
King Charles the Turd, Jug Ears The Thick has secured his place at the apex of the parasite class. In one sense I'd almost admire him for doing that. We really should follow the French model
Whinge Whinge Whinge get a job get a life grow up put some effort into something else .
So well observed , bang on mate !
Totally agree 😎 f%#k um off,nice job in McDonald’s
THE QUEEN GAVE OUR SOVEREIGNTY AWAY TO EUROPE 🤢🤢🤢🤢THAT WAS ILLEGAL🤮🤮🤮🤮she did not have the power to do that. Now Charles is going to give our sovereignty to the w.h.o if we don’t stop him.
I am not a great supporter of Charles because he is in league with the WEF but if you follow the American example what do you get instead as an "elected head of state"? Can you think of any US  president that you would want as our head of state? Do you really believe the Americans live in a free Utopia? Dream on. All scrapping the "safety buffer" of the monarchy ultimately leads to is converting your country into a totalitarian state like China, Korea or Russia. As for the freedom to walk on Crown land, you obviously don't get out much, 99 per cent of it is open to the public and is walked on everyday by the general public, just try that in any totalitarian controlled country and see how long it takes for you to get arrested.
Not my king, after what he did to Diana. Give the nurses a pay rise. Bloody well said
Their ancestors were better cattle thieves than the rest of us. It`s as simple as that!
Sorry. When you have to resort to insults, you have no valid arguments. Try again.
Best video on YouTube.  Let's not stop there let's expose the very rich and the huge companies that are making this world hard to live in.
I am so glad the next generation has not been brainwashed like we were, Everybody is entitled to live a happy and healthy life not just the royal family.
95% of the wealth & land in the uk is owned by the privileged 5% this includes the little terraced you or I live in…..Makes you think?
Damn, van dame 💙😅💙
Don't need the royals  They do nothing for any folk in UK
I agree with everything he said. We should not have a royal family. The money they take from us could be put to much better use. We need a totally new way of running the country. Too many people in power abuse their power. We need a much fairer society.
Prince Charles is a Rothschild and second cousin to Hitler. .
Slava socialistics respublik velikobritaniya!
Glory to the Socialist Republic of Great Britain!
Wow!! Bravo!! Well said. You definitely speak for me. 👍👍
He also loves p3dos. Birds of a feather...
Great shit tho ahahaha
This is why I could never serve in the armed forces.
Coronation chicken does bang tho
The ceremony of the dedication of the Harrods Shopping  bags full of money and the elevation of the new Russian and Arab peers will be the highlight for me.
Ignorance beyond belief 😊
No one ever mentions that the kings great grandad never gave his cousins the Romanovs save haven during the 1917 Russian Revolution and look what happened.
The only thing this person has exposed is his ignorance and bitterness.
Charles is on the board of Klaus Schwab an Gates pushing digital currency and 15 minute cities queen Elizabeth told Australia before she died that she owns every square inch of Australia now all land taxes are now going up beyond reach
i would never stand up for the queen at the abc minors saturday morning..it just didnt feel right me and my mate was 10 year old .im a lot older now .and i am anti royalist..they are nothing but leeches on the british public..
Who the he'll are you
The King spoke of having scars on his back as proof of the hard times he endured as a young prince. They were not from a whip, but the result of particulalry nasty rituals forced upon those in positions of feigned power. The light must now be shone into the shadows.
Quite a few Pricks on here. 😊
Get rid of the lot of them including lords earls barons etc
Absolutely fantastic, total agreement, well said.
There are still some People in UK that still think that monarchy done good things for UK, while I ask them please show me their achievements, and they only speak of the past but none of presents
Thank you  ❤️🕊🌈
The World is brilliant at “electing” leaders though isn’t it?…Hitler, Putin, Amin, Trump, Johnson….etc. etc….Nice idea but I don’t trust people to put the right people at the top….
Charles also had very strong connections to the celebrity/political paedophile ring that operated during Edward Heath's time as Prime Minister while Charles was much younger, yet NO-ONE will instigate a legal investigation into just how far Charles became involved, as he is now about to be crowned King, and is thus untouchable by the laws of the land he will rule over. Charles has made his coronation "Muslim friendly" to appease his paymasters in Saudi Arabia (The people he's been SELLING British honours and citizenship to, for "donations" to his personal charity organisation), and claims to be the self-styled "Defender Of The Faiths" in England. If he is the Defender Of The Faiths, he should also listen to those who say they DON'T want his prodigal son at the ceremony, as the saying goes: Vox populi vox deorum (Latin. Translated means: The voice of the people is the voice of the gods), yet he is ignoring every voice except those obviously in his head, and is seemingly hell bent on having the traitor son at his ceremony, albeit 10 rows behind the rest of the Royal Family, for security reasons, as Harry is well known for his wearing of a hidden recording device, to gain information he can then use to attack his family. Charles has abused his position in the Royal Family to influence trade/politics and even now religious matters (He had the Bible "edited" so that Camilla can be crowned Queen beside him, and not as Queen Consort, which she would be under both legal and religious laws in England). Charles is a monster hiding in plain sight, always has been, and now will have even more power at his command, more influence over the lives of his countrymen as well as the Commonwealth nations, and will continue to abuse that power for his own gain, and the world will applaud him for being the "Woke King" they all wanted him to be.
king   Taras   3 !!!!!!!  !!!!!!!!!!!!
🔥 #notmyking
The song was hilarious 😆
are you seeing what is going on in the great republic of US.  Yeh given a man some power and he becomes a tyrant.  You are so misguided
I like to hear when a Brit say the things you said. I like hearing the truth.
this is not nice vindictive
I’m glad someone had the guts to tell the truth about the monarchy, and how they are all criminals, and only get away with their crimes with the help of another corrupt institution, the mainstream media, aka “The Fake News”. What gets me about the monarchy is, NOBODY ever voted them into their position.  It all started thousands of years ago when their ancestors just proclaimed themselves Kings & Queens, and if anybody opposed them, they were slaughtered.  There are NO laws that entitles the Windsor’s to be in their position, there are historian who say there are others who claim to be the original monarchy, and even with them, they are NO laws to say they are the genuine monarchy, because as I said before, NOBODY ever voted either these people to be their King or Queen.  We vote for our political leaders NOT any so-called royals. Just who gives them the right to live in a luxury lifestyle, paid by the taxpayer? Down through the centuries they have used their position to bully, and sometimes have people killed who would oppose them, which still carries on today, example, Diana.
You do realise that they own most of the land in the UK don't you, and they give all of it. Over £1bn paid in, 21m ish returned.
The security of your voting, representative government with checks and balances, laws that include human rights and free speech, and a bank that is run by the people, not a globalist bank owned Privately by a group of gangsters like it is now.
Education system? more like propaganda system. Great video, bang on.
It’s not hard to work out! Look at their vast wealth now compare it to your own? There just a bunch of pompous pricks, if they really wanted to make a different to this country they could but choose not to! But there happy for us to fund their lavish lifestyles and this lavish coronation whilst the majority  in this country struggle with every day bills, you do the maths.
Top bloke top channel bollocks to the whole lot of them
Always remember it's the British deep state that keeps the Royals in power, it's actually the British deep state that should fall (Mi5/media/corporate power) that's the rouse to keep the plebs in their place.
I despise Charles to the same degree that I respected Elizabeth. The institution itself, needs to end. It represents the evil of social exclusion.
Totally agree with the arguments for abolishing Monarchy, waste of space , inbred sexual delinquents. Revolution and power to the people!!
Go live in France, bro
Artists like that don’t exist anymore because they have prostituted themselves to the big bank global social agenda that is a scam that they are pushing to basically control, tax, reduce The population.  Communism is scam in order to take power from one entity and then again from the people.  Yeah voting rights and the security of that with a representative government “republic”and a peoples’ run bank are essential.  The problem is big banks who have a vested interest in crisis and war. and a profit from any crisis and helps them Institute big changes quickly.
How unfair you are ! At least, for me . I am French, do you think French people are much luckier than the Britons are ? Life is difficult, for many countries, many people . Just think about your late majesty Queen Elizabeth II, she reigned for 70 years , a Queen or King doesn't rule, he/ she reigns . They, on the contrary of what you pretend, they pay taxes . The Prime Minister and the government do . Of course the coronation costs a lot of money but a  lot comes back to. At least you can enjoy and be proud of the beautiful pageantry . . Just think twice and be fair ...
WOW, They suck the blood out of the people
We all saw Charlie,s mask slip for a few seconds when that  pen would,nt write
Read your bible and find out  who he is
Except the monarch has no power. Parliamentarians are the ones who make the rules and hold the power. It’s irrelevant WHO is in power, because whoever is, is always corrupt - that is the nature of power, and exactly what draws corrupt people to pursue it. Never has a just and righteous person wanted to rule a country, so dissolving the monarchy would make not one jot of difference.
Absolutely. They have a very large stake in Black rock The largest funder of every other bank in the world. They are the ones pushing the agenda in tandem with the WEF  and some others I will not mention here.
Parasites
How dare you, you as a former  british soldier.  Swore an oath of allegiance to Her Majesty her heirs and successors. You think without the royal family we would be better off. Well you only have to look at say France or any other EU country run  be politician the populace dont fair any better. The King and other members of the family have been serving in our armed service..  you might not have learned about engllish history, but when i went to school, we learnt about all history and how to learn from the mistakes that had been made. No no England will all ways be bettsr off with a monarch.
Charge them death taxes and make them pay all their taxes. Make them have to abide  by the same rules and laws everybody else does…they have so many exemptions…Every time the government bring out a new bill they get exemptions to it. Make them give back all the estates and lands they have historically stolen. Give the palaces and estates to the National Trust and you get more visitors to go see them. For instance the money generated by the French ref visitors to Versailles if must more than what the royals generate for this country. Cancel all moneys paid to them by the civil list…make Carly boy pay for his coronation Finally get the guillotine out
I really hope Charles has a lovely, extravagant, expensive party, while i sit here eating a packet of crisps for dinner because I've spent all my money on bills and petrol.
The Royal Family is nothing more than a diversion - the real skullduggery goes on behind the scenes in Westminster. The gangsters chuckle to themselves while the Royals draw attention away from their shady practices.
Why does being a former soldier give you credence and credibility when it comes to the constitution of the UK??? You’re an embarrassment mate.
Crappy video . what we're you trying to preach
I served for 6 months on HMS Norfolk first commission and Prince Charles was one of the great officers I served with onboard. Criticising him for not having done enough military service, not killed anyone and be a decent chap is plain wrong.  AS a young man he was intelligent kind and had insights far in advance of his peers at that time, especially with regard to the environment.  I have followed his life over the years and apart from his human failings with regard to Diana, he still enjoys my support for all his work with the Princes Trust and other charitable organisations.  Condemning the man for his past family's deeds is a touch unfair, look at the man, not the rhetoric.  Replacing this type of constitutional monarchy with a so called elected President is the first step to ruination of the country.  Just look no further than how "Presidents " are elected across the pond and in other countries, mostly via a corrupt elitist war mongering cabal.  Should we really run the risk of having a "trump" style president or at the worst case another Putin.
While not arguing with this soldier , the French,  I might point out,  are no happier with their Republican govt right now.
what movies was in there sorry
The corination of the lizard king  descendant of vlad the impaler.  .blood letting and child sacrifices   on the eve of the corination  full moon birth and re birth .
This coronation, if it happens, will be very interesting. Charles is a demon, just like the rest. We're going to be Gobsmacked. Trump's in Scotland. Hmmm.
Good analysis,  I remember when GSTQ by the Sex Pistols came out.  The local record store was picketed by WW2 vets.
Agree with you to a limit, I loved my Queen don’t like the next two. But William and Kate are so much the people’s  people.
If we can't use the French model, we should definitely stick them in a council house
King Paedo, now that his mother's dead.
Well said sir!😁
Prefer our historic royalty to the left wing socialist hypocritical anti monarchy lot, we'd be left with nothing of our history but communist hopelessnes!
Well said it's good to hear someone tell the truth. Millions of people are living in poverty while these biggest scoungers live in over the top luxury . It's absolutely disgusting they need getting rid of we don't need them or their hangers on 🤮
#DownWithTheCrown
Fundamentally I agree, the Royals should go. The point I disagree with is the youth factor... Because Britain is fragmented. Britain is no longer a nation, but rather a large number of different kinds of people from many different places. It is this lack of cohesion which will guarantee that nothing will ever change, and maybe that was the plan. Finally, you mentioned the V word. Elections can be rigged, therefore voting for something is pretty pointless
Could not agree more it’s all theatre for the indoctrinated
What regiment was he in
The Royals Make Us 🤮 & Angry 😡. Camilla Queen She Was His Bit On The Side She’s No Queen. Who Had Diana & Dodi Assassinated Then To Order ?. If Meghan Had Stayed In 🇬🇧 She’d Be Risking Her Life Also. The Royals Are Above The Law Because They Own The Government, Police & Security Services. 😡😡👎
I found that aristocrats are like  this old American out of work going to Walmart to steel stuff! Only they've been doing it for generations, do now they are dressed in velvet with not only layers of gold chains, but heavy crown!! 😂 And the crowd of thieces all go  : " God save the King! If only I could get to be like him!!"
Well said my friend, I agree with every word you have said. Myself and millions of others have to make choices every day as to what, and even can we afford, to eat or heat. Yet this bunch of freeloaders are spending obscene amounts of money on this exclusive party.

It is not fair but it works.  Anacyclosis should be avoided and the British institutions are designed exactly for this with a commons lords and monarchy.
What/Who do we replace them with?  A Trump, A Biden, A Nixon...
agree on everything you said,just criminals but in power unfortunately...
I hope to live long enough to see the end of the most corrupt murderous tax dodging colonists racist do nothings manipulative inbred rapists institution
So true.
NOT MINE... 🤬
Nobody's allowed to shout down the current political regime as we stride our way into totalitarianism. A bit concerned about the King's interest in the UN and the WEF. Those of us who have lived under political presidents, cannot really recommend it. We are in fact a royal republic so have the best of both worlds. I would think you're deluded if you think the monarchy could be replaced by anything cheaper.
What exactly did you 'Expose' here? Apart from your clickbait strategy
. I’ve been open to Debate about why these people commenting think a Republic will be more beneficial than our great and proud traditions. Not one has come back with a solid argument, not one... so I’m thinking A lot of these comments are from false accounts, how unethical are these so-called republic waste of timers  ? They hide behind a Ruse that they are someone else.  It's probably because they know what they are Stating is complete and utter rubbish. They hide under the guise of anonymity and In some cases false Nationalitys. but people see through the deception and stupidity of it all, how stupid are they to think people don’t see through it all? They are no different to the Russian trolls who comment on the illegal invasion of Ukraine. How can they stoop so low? Anyone here reading this, will you explain to me why you think a republic will benefit us in any way? and please before you respond think and don’t respond with emotional unreasonable nonsense or fantasies without a true and reputable source for your reply. I await your response
He mentions the biggest gangsters of all, and he is wrong. This guy here is a hypocrite and a traitor. The real gangsters are the Roman Catholic church, but he is blind to that. This guy isn't entitled to wear any medals now, because he has broken his oath.  He is a traitor.
They changed their name from Saxe Coberg-Gotha  to Windsor to hide the fact that they are German! It was changed because they feared retribution.
This guy took an oath. He has broken trying to come out a better man. Don't let this oath breaker and traitor fool you. We have a narcissist seeking attention. Shun him. Never trust an oath breaker. They will stab you in the back for their own gain.
Good on you, soldier, a standing ovation for you, may God be with you bravo.
Adulters on the throne "representing" Church of England.  How noble!
Well said, Joe, you've got it right again.
You have a giant chip on your shoulder,my friend.
Charly da Turd has lost the game now that it is so widely known he is so well in with the Davos mob.    An evil mob of gangsters if ever there was. Goodbye monarchy, goodbye mega hypocrisy.        But remember, you get a republic, you end up with Joe Biden or Macron. The people have to have a revolution every two generations as politics is a magnet for conmen and gangsters. God forbid on the other hand we end up with rampant goosesteppers or totalitarianism.      Poor old Joe ordinary can never win.
There's no lie in this...fundamentally wrong it is..
The WEF Walter Mitty!  The sheep are pledging allegiance to Kl4us & his eug3nics cronies!! 🤡🌎
All Kings and Queens. Need to be brought down. To end slavery.
How about a simple ceremony and fund hospitals?
very interesting
The Stone of Destiny the queen and next the king were and will not be the official rulers of britain ! because the stone that they are carinated on is not the real the real stone Jacobs pillow ! all the laws made by these two are Not legit !  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyMasVjY-vg
We'll said bro totally 100% correct thanks for the video
Yes I feel we need to swear our allegiance to king charles in the same way he swore his allegiance to Princess Diana - what a role model for youngsters in the U.K.
Diana
Todays media block dissent vias social media and will not allow your free speech agaisnt the fascist dictators and favporite for our public money just handed to them on a plate in the name of some sort of feelings of deservedness. I can think of many people and  families are more deserving.
As an ex civil servant I got into alot of trouble because I refused to address "royalty" by their titles. I referred to the "Queen" as Mrs Windsor or The Big Boss. I knew I wouldn't be allowed to serve in places like the Home Office or Foreign Office because of my views but I honestly didn't care. As far as I viewed it I was there to serve Parliament who were voted in by the people of this country - so in reality I was serving the voters. I enjoyed every moment of my job because I really wanted to make a difference for this country (I didn't have the temperament to be in the forces - my father was an ex marine and I wanted to follow in his footsteps but he wisely talked me out of it because he said I would always question orders. He wasn't wrong!)
Brilliant - it’s time to get rid of the lot of them. Who are these morons that seem to idolise them ?? weird
Instead of paying taxes, maybe we should bring back the sheriffs of the Counties & I can take in a bag of potatoes, which may or may not have blight in them? Or a chicken or rooster, maybe a small pig. They don't deserve the feelings that many UK public & foreigners adorn them with. The New King has had his wedding day & that woman is now passed. She gave him his heirs & so the unfairness can continue. This one should have been on the philanderers bill, but even then the cash he holds isn't something he's generated, it's from the publics purse. #StopTheRot #WakeyWakey #LedByDonkeys #NHSpay15 #Strikes #GTTO #NepotismTories #MoneyForNothing #Waspi #MPStheft #AngryMinersUnited #PinocchioBoris #CorruptTories #NeverForgiveNeverForget #MrAngry #NotMyKing
I drove into Surrey/Sussex from up north and saw parades of shops with (bright blue) Union flags draped across them. My immediate thought  was WTF/What's This For?
Lol a s2pd brit 😂😂😂 that is why you are now under an indian rule and populated by extremist muslims 😂😂😂
Time to get rid of the lot of them and oh boy there are a lot of them..
I remember when I was a kid me and a mate went to the cinema. When the film was over they played the National Anthem at which the whole audience was expected to stand, unfortunately I for some reason didn’t stand and was swiftly banged in the ear by a gorilla standing behind me who was mumbling incoherently something about lack of respect etc. Ever since then, despite swearing allegiance to the Queen when I joined the army, I have been ambivalent about their role and finally came to the conclusion they are a complete waste of space and should be pickled in formaldehyde and displayed in a glass case in some museum. On your point on the Wars of the Three Kingdoms   If Cromwell had only accepted the arguments put forward by the Levellers at Putney we might be living in a far more equal society today.
What a load of rubbish. You should be ashamed of yourself like you I am an ex serviceman who pledged allegiance to the Monarchy. Clearly oaths mean nothing to you.
Well said. More members of the army need to speak up. These people are also unelected, and against democrazy. Royal gaslighting propanda
Sadly, it is not God's will for a king. God is great because he gave us free choice. The people wanted a king to be just like other countries. The only king we need is God. If we did this channel would be on another topic. Having said this enjoyed listening to this analysis! 😊
All that pomp, people starving.  What a prat he is.  God given right my arse.
Well put and well said 👏
A soldier complaining about arms deals? A soldier complaining about human social standards? You are the tool best loved by the kind of fascist leadership, war mongers are nothing without the tools to do the killing for them.
He never changed the name.... So Charles III .....symbolic?
The man was best friends with the likes of Jimmy Saville...that should tell you everything you need to know.. let us not even discuss Andrews Epstein encounters!!!
You got me at the thumbnail and the video was class (😂)
absolutely FANTASTIC!
What a disgrace, you served for the royal family your just as bad . Can I ask did harry put you up to this 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🤔
Diana was a real person who was for the people.
The royalt family are the decendants of War Lords who invaded and conquered great swathes of land over a thousand years ago. They built up armies and constructed castles to maintain their hold on the land and people. They still live in castles and head the armed forces. King Charles is a War Lord in a Saville Row suit.
They’re in a council house already… (Buckingham Palace) get housing benefits (civil list) but don’t pay bedroom tax on the 90 excess bedrooms! They receive benefits and receive untaxed income from private estates and businesses, if we had this set up we’d be in jail for benefit fraud and tax avoidance. Yet people defend them, their way of life and shady deals. Charles is the biggest hypocrite, cast his brother into the wilderness for his association with the American nonce…. Yet Charles was best buddies with Britains most prolific child and sex abuser Jimmy Saville. Rotten to the bloody core!
I like the monarchy myself and I don't mind paying towards it.
I find this to be a very courageous talk and I agree with the depiction. Years ago I found myself criticizing the fact, that British passports indicate "subject to the Queen of England" and I added that I would not be comfortable to be subject to anyone. My British counterpart reacted with irritation saying: "... and I would not want to be subject to a bunch of political crooks like you are in Italy". Well, he was not totally wrong.
Our king should pledge allegiance to his people all British people one thing Harry got right is somehow this past hundred years the royal family got surrounded by crimminals who took control Charles should take back control by law Charles as a man has some great ideas concerning our food water and air He could use the laws of his lands to change the system use the Law's his laws to gain back control To do that though he has to be brave and clever gather the powerful around him especially his sons
I am Australian and i curse these luciferin people they own all of Australia , Canda New Zealand and all of the commonwealth land.....i agree with you mate they are pure evil .
I'm Aussie. We ditched King Charles for Kings Gates & Schwab a while back.
There will still be thousands and thousands of mugs watching and supporting this shameful event.
Even a lot of us here in the US know about Charles and his pal Klaus Schwab. Evil people.
So as a British soldier did this guy fight Republicans in Ireland  as a British soldier? If he did that makes him a hypocrite also !
Great Britain no longer great. We are not all sheep. So refreshing to hear something honest
EVOLUTION .. before .. REVOLUTION. Still my humble opinion.
Why do most professional photographers images of Charles usually show him looking away from the camera?  I don’t trust anyone who doesn’t willingly give eye contact.
Someone is calling this out. Nonsheep energy!
How do we get rid of them ?
Did you know that the royals get a cut of every US tax dollar, that is the US corporation. The truth will soon be revealed and the evil will shock you to your core. Be prepared.
This video should be renamed.  "Random anti-royalist guy moans about the Royal family for 9 minutes, lying constantly and presenting no rational argument whatsoever".
Thank you for pointing out that it was the English that had the first revolution. Calling it a civil war completely undermines the truth and allows the gangsters to perpetuate the myth that the English are a nation of forelock tuggers. Personally, I believe that it was the mercantile Gangster class that won power after the revolutions to depose monarchies. These are the institutions that must fall in the next revolution.
Medieval costume-wearing silliness designed to remind us of our place and that we’re subservient to an elite.   Until we decide that we’re subservient no longer……
Charles is just Camilla's puppet how long will he live when she becomes Queen
I very recently watched a documentary about Bishop Peter Ball, a serious hardcore pefophile who, the number of children he abused was over 500. Also there was the infamous Jimmy Savile, another monstrous pedophile who also abused hundreds of children. These monsters were very close friends of Prince Charles who protected them. He even bought a very large house for Bishop Peter, (Pedophile) Ball. What does this tell you about Prince charles??
Off with their heads, they are leeches on the people hangers on to a man, an out dated institution well past its sell by date
My mum was born in Liverpool 1917, Dad came from Northern Wales, they came to Australia mid 50's, mum loved Queen Liz, but I have always said they seem like the biggest welfare cheats form the big end of town
PEOPLE IN GENERAL ARE FAST BECOMING MORE AWARE OF ONE SIMPLE UNIVERSAL FACT & THAT IS: ALL HUMANS ARE BORN EQUAL IN THE EYES OF GOD! FAMILIES WITH ASTOUNDING AMOUNTS OF WEALTH ARE WELL DOCUMENTED FOR THEIR "INBREEDING", SO MUCH SO THAT WHILST TYPING "INBREEDING" POPPED UP ON MY KEYBOARD PROMPTER BEFORE I HAD STARTED TO TYPE INBREEDING, IS IT ANY WONDER THAT EONS OF THIS BEHAVIOUR CREATES A ROYAL BUNCH OF QUESTIONABLES!
sooner spend the money on public health, education & housing
The time is right for change !
You didn't even mention the hit on his wife
Respect man 🙏🏾
The very naive, green climate goblin and founding member of the WEF with kraut buddy Schlob, a truly dangerous marriage of hate the peasants, made in hell. OFF with his head.
Former military myself and agree totally with everything this man says. When I was young, impressionable, niave and idealistic I took and signed the oath of allegiance believing with all my heart in what it meant and I was willing to die for this 'society' in defending it's democratic principles, however after redundancy in 1994 I've realised just how undemocratic and corporatized this 'society' and country is, I am now 59 and have finally wised up. A Royal family is an outmoded and outdated institution that has no relevance in modern 'society' other than the fact that it is a corporation that operates in the same principles as any other and the divine right to 'rule' is a farcical excuse for the family to hold onto the vestiges of power and associated wealth.
Oh shut up moaning all the time
They’re Germans and all that money spent when so many children are eating from food banks and what about lovely Diana,what really happened to her ,the only decent one among them ,how lucky was Harry to get out of there
I like the monarchy idea and Charles. But I’m inclined to agree with you. There’s always this big dilemma in the back of every informed and sensible person mind.
Interesting that you should say the mocking of royalty comes from a working class background i.e. the Sex Pistols but then mention Monty Python who are certainly not very working class, they met at "Top" universities. I think this shows realisation of the con runs through society as a whole. Support for undemocratic institutions comes from people who have gained power in similar ways and want to keep the power.  I give you our media barons as an example!
No one is talking about the regular trips the Royal plane did from RAF Northolt to David Epsteins private island,  organsied by Ghislian Maxwell, who was on those flights?? And what were they doing on Epstiens private island?? Were there any children on board??
Very true. They are imposters and it amazes me how this system remains upheld for so long. It shows just how oblivious and compliant most of us are. Even on the smallest of things, such as people still actually paying a license for the BBC to lie to them. Just wake up people! Charles is right behind the WEF, who want most of us gone, unable to travel, eat meat, have access to cheap energy and be able to thrive. I've known it for at least 15 years now, that we are ruled over by utter psychopaths who think we are nothing but Ants to be walked on. This reality must change.
What replaces it though? The French are busy revolting against Macron and his dictatorial edicts, the American system is also rotten and corrupt. If anything the world is run by an elite mafia, such as Klaus Shwab and George Soros and others who run the WEF.
Paid 0 inhertence tax while we plebs have to pay
The argument of "they bring in tourism" is bullsh*t. France did away with their monarchs a few centuries ago, you never see Paris short of tourists. Or Berlin, or Moscow, Washington DC, Budapest.............. or any other major capitol that doesn't have royals
Biggest corrupt gang in town. Been grave-robbing 3:56  the world for centuries ‘ bringing the spoils back to fuckingham and filling there boots with Land ‘ Gold  etc.   It’s the curse of every British citizen to put up with this facade.   Off with free money.  Close down there banks.  Return the spoils from the empire and put the simpsons in the palace.
An idiot who said that "fox hunting is ROMANTIC";  The royal family addicted to blood sports; have killed for fun, more animals and birds than any other family on the planet; the late queen, just as bad, as are Harry William and Diana, who apparently applauded her sons for their hunting skills. Charles obession with flaky alternative medicine is proof that he is scientifically illiterate. A guy who demands loyalty, yet according to many who were close to him, could not be trusted to return it.
Having turned my tv on this morning i can not say how pleased after watching Lorraine salivating over the coming of the Coronation and all her Celeb fuelled shite that having turned to You tube as so many do now for any form of truth i chanced upon your video . Rarely have i watched a point of view that you put forth with such clarity and so bang on the fucking nail ....brilliant subcribed!
I don't support the NHS/Doctors, look at the harm they have done since 2020. Teachers are equally as bad. Some of the railway workers get VERY high wages for no real skill. Indeed, I have noticed much scorn towards Charles - many say "not my King". Mind you I think the British Army have let us down also, 77th Regt. and the active involvement with VZ. Clean up Britain! .
When Reuters is promoting news about young people rejecting the monarchy you know there is a message presenting a sentiment that is part of a larger narrative and agenda because Reuters is completely affiliated and owned by long time partners or even a part of the British Monarchy.
A family of billionaires being worshiped by underpaid peasants.
Fully clickbaited onto this video thinking it was going to be cringe, but it was absolutely fantastic.  As someone who's invloved in land acquistion, the point about land and estate owned by the crown blows my mind. Agricultural interests include both livestock and arable farming. Consisting of around 263,000 acres across the UK, they also include 66,500 acres of common land principally in Wales. They also have rights to extract minerals over 285,500 acres - which means they have the right to the minerals (granite, gold, coal, whatever) underneath land that is not directly owned by them.

PS: King Charles The 2nd was OK... He put a law in place allowing King Charles Cavalier spaniels into pubs & resteraunts for a feed & water!
Hear hear my man. I'm thoroughly fed up with the coronation mania going on at the minute. And we're treated like outcasts if we dare question the bottomless pits of money being spent on it. My daughter has been told she has to take part in an exercise in school where they have to write good luck cards to Charlie. And the best ones will be sent to him. The email about it actually said "Participation is mandatory". It's a bit North Korea that isn't it?
The modern monarchy plundered the world and brought back vast stacks full of Gold to Britain. It gives the nation a pride and uplift. I don't think we should be too critical of Royal family. Yes, among them if democratic process starts then they should be able to select rather than inherit the position. That way a more down to earth and able bodied monarch would be selected.
I DON'T HAVE ANY RESPECT FOR THOSE WHO TAKE FROM THE COMMON MAN, LIVE IN PALACES WHILST KIDS SLEEP ON THE STREETS, PAY NO TAX ON MONEY THEY ARE GIVEN FOR DOING WHAT??? PONCING ABOUT LOOKING LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE ON STEROIDS WITH ALL THEIR SHINEY TIN & COLOURED RIBBONS... GIVE ME A BREAK! I AM NOT & NEVER WILL BE A SUPPORTER OF THE UGH' "MONARCHY" & I AM ENGLISH BORN'N'BRED!...
You are a mouth piece for the communist agenda. We are born free not equal. How can we be equal unless forced to be ?? Which is exactly what these socialist/communists want. If you work hard and earn money, you are a threat to the victims that scream, privileged, white, slave owners, it’s absolutely ridiculous. Some people make very bad choices, others make good ones…The British Monarchy is supposed to uphold the laws of God, by swearing an oath, which has been with us and when not abused has worked for thousands of years. Good luck with your NWO, that you are screaming for, the one world Dear Leader, Anti Christ is on his way - but he can’t save you from the lake of fire…..wake up 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Agree with you mate...
Charles is as criminal, plotted and murdered his ex wife, done numerous other crimes, andrew and epstein just the tip of the iceberg. Charles and his WEF pals are now coming for you and your children, its happening now. They are evil and criminals while they wave and smile at the general public, they dont give a monkey's about the normal people.
Where are the 9 Canadian children the Queen and Philip took from the orphanage. Why did MI5 not know about Jimmy Saville and warn the queen not to knight him and stop him going shooting with Charles. Why did the tax payer pay 10M to shut up a 17yr old he had sex with at Epstein island. Anyone remember all this stuff.
Totally agree with everything you have said. Personally I feel that, the only way to stop all of these issues , is for there to be another civil war. The powers that be haven't learnt much from the last one and never will!
Ha ha "they have great hair" 👍😂
Look at the USA, France now, today, regarding republics. As a ‘figurehead’ only, the monarch has, up to recently, becalmed the nation. What will replace: another strong family. We could be ruled by the Albanian mafia, the Yardies, muslim fanatics/fundamentalists, or any number of extremists? The monarchy is not ideal, but think about the potential alternatives.
👏
Great video - thanks. But dont you feel the Sex Pistols, Python etc are just safety valves? The king's jester? Have I Got News For You is a Beeb institution, FFS
Well said mate. Especially the Military Uniforms/medals/decorations. I don't remember Charles ever doing selection, never mind basic training. A completely outdated concept, has no future in the real world.
Good man! Thank you for exposing the truly evil they’re 🙏🏽
There will be many followers of this circus, many followers that vote dopey governments into power, and the people then get bopped on the head AND SAY THANKYOU !
Seeing what Macron and Biden are doing to their own countries, are they worse though?
what do you mean job they don't have job at all,they want all money in the banks that's belongs to hard working peoples like slavery,refugees,immigrants,migrants,foreigners (etc)
Reading the comments this bloke  has simply encouraged the worlds lefties, republicans and third world envious types to type their usual one liners.
i know that that's wrong,because he knows all the killing all over the world
I swear to bear allegiance to my fellow working man, to abolish an outdated priveledged society and give to the people what is rightfully thiers. I swear to abolish colonialism and the house of LARDS. To give back to  people the right to live in a Free and equal society deviod of class distinction or priveledge ,WE ARE THE PEOPLE, we are the power.  The peoples Oath.
I loved the Queen, but not a fan of Charles, but if we didn't  have the royal institution then we have lost all our collective britsh identity and we will be just like every other shite country,
Another delusional prat who should sod off and live in a communist republic who wants his 2 minutes of traitorous fame.
Yup spot on get rid of the royels
England needs a King, simply not Charles. No King, easy invasion... Strong King, no invasion... uncle Putin be a good strong white male choice, or Trump...
Charles is a WEF founder that want dictatorship, dystopia and us all in poverty.   Why should he be a king, whats his qualification.  Hes not elected and takes millions of our tax money even though he's one of the richest men in the world.
Fair play to you, Mr. Glenton.
As a former British soldier I am in total agreement with this gent.
Get rid of the monarchy and rewild ALL their land. The planet needs it.
They should all be advertised free to a good home.  Bucks palace should be rented out  for £20,000 a night  thst goes back into the countrys pot.  Duck the Parasite Royals.
No axes to grind there at all
I am so happy that I will miss this cringe fest being here in beautiful Dubai
Fantastic clip, thank you. What strikes me is most of us watching this would be totally embarrassed sitting on a huge gold chair and watching other people gushing over us.
Well said Sir.
The French and the Russians had the right idea...
They aren’t even British.
All over the land? Certainly not through most of Scotland. Projections put only 17% even watching it, let alone doing any kind of celebrating.
Get them out, but where do we start?
😮
Agreed.. these royals, politicians yes Left and right wing, elitist celebrities and big corporations are all in bed together for all to see.  The little man (Yes little women too) on the street are copping it right in the neck. Stand together folks and push back against these tyrants.
Doesn't the line of Kings in England have reputation of cutting people's heads off?  Isn't this why people fled Britain and rebelled against the crown to become AMERICA?
There is only ONE KING: Jesus.  The Son of the Most High God.  In Hebrew his name is Joshua.
I prey and hope we get fid of them
Most interesting indeed ... I see a rabbit hole before me, and curiosity whispers in my ear ... "Go seek, and you shall find"
Notice how in the begining, with the whole "Camilla would never become queen in future"  then six months ago,  she will be known as ..."The Queen consort"   to now being "The Queen"  as they have now dropped  "Consort" from her title ...     and not one single Fu****g word is said about it   Just makes me sick how the so called news media promote their properganda. wheres all the real journalists gone. no-one in the media ever askes ... "Why".  It seems that all the pollitical stuff is just pure circus, a side show  a bit like ( or should it be BAT like)  the whole Covid 19 magic show. Well right now "The Great reset is in full flow"   to put everyone back in their box. To reinstate the 1% the 4% and the 95%  ratio.
They’re part of the oligarchical corrupt Teflon coated WEF. Out or off them. Enough.
Your spot 👍
You do this from your hart just a shame the have enough money to fall the plebs
Peasants revolt 2.
It's so OBVIOUS that this man does NOT stand on ACTUAL PRINCIPLES, only what HE thinks is "politically" correct and will make his own utter BS believable to the peasants. This morally compromised scum bucket is REALLY going to forego the traditional, holy anointing oil and request that it be "VEGAN"....AND make sure that this request gets airplay in the news coverage??? What a FRAUD! If he was a strict VEGETARIAN I MIGHT be able to accept this...but he ISN'T. He isn't even a semi strict vegetarian. At BEST, he's an accidental vegetarian. Eating only a vegetarian diet 2x a week HARDLY constitutes a deep, principled dedication to a vegetarian diet. Frankly, it truly DOES sound like an "accident". Many people end up not eating any meat for 2 days out of 7. This guy is a FARCE. If someone told you they were comitted to their career but showed up to the job only twice a week would you REALLY believe they were "committed"??? Smh. Welcome to the club of farcical, supposed "leaders", England.  We Americans can, wholly, sympathize. A man who is so WOKE that he's willing to forego the highly meaningful and holy traditional anointing oil to request that it be VEGAN when he's not even remotely close to BEING vegan is absurd. I wonder if, for the coronation dinner, we will see him dining on nothing but a feast of delicious BUGS and MAGGOTS...you know, global warming and all...not to mention his near perfect adherence to a vegetarian diet. WHAT A JOKE!!!
I can't wait for Australia to gets it's shit together and kick the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha parasites to the curb.
When one of the richest men take payments for influence.  I have never been a monarchist.  When the Queen died. The monarchy should have ended. The wealth the Windsors have and yet still take payments from the people. The levy applied in areas they have seats in. The cost of maintenance and security. Would the UK get less tourists without a monarchy. I doubt it. It's not often they are present. People still visit Paris.  New York.  Time to call it a day.
How stupid
Its a cult
_WOW_ ! Only problem now is thanks to mass immigration and cultural Marxism, our national identity has been neutered.  Look at our "prime minister" and the so - called "mayor" of our once great city of London!
The most frightening part of the Royalist saga is the insidious drip drip of propaganda in schools and the Media. It used to be called propaganda and one European country thought they had that all to themselves. Oh how wrong they were....
Cronwell tirned into a defacto king. Everthing is set out to stop. Power corrupts all.
How the hell did an adulterer and his mistress become King and Queen . That’s corruption at its worst
Saxo gotha coberg. Parasites
You talk a lot of sense. I personally think that the death of the Queen should have triggered a debate and then vote on whether we want another Monarch or not. I think most people having heard the truth and having seen both sides of the argument would not want to continue with this archaic tradition. I would be happy to go with the majority, but we needed to be given the choice. The trouble is voices are silenced by the biased and controlled media.
A simple question to all those who support the 'royals':  How did they become 'royal'?
The monarchy is not helping the country and its people it has more money on the backs of us workers The land they have us not there’s the money they have is looted from us Time for a change
'The Firm' owns alot of land across the world. In fact entire countries. The house your land is built on is not owned by you but by the Crown. You will not get rid of the Monarchy no matter how hard you try.  Harry and Meghan tried to get away but they are pulled back into the Media constantly by the Royal press office.
You just don't understand society or economics.  Allegiance to the king brings untold wealth to the UK - tourism top of the list but they also work their fingers to the bone serving society and business - cutting ribbons and making speeches.  The monarchy provide a centre for society - a centre of stability.   Your presentation from the get-go was so vitriolic that it was impossible to listen on because you have demonstrated your partisanship.
Off with there heads 👺🤡
How very true 👏👏👏👍👍
This is why soldiering is a young mans game, as omce you mature tou figure out it was all a con.   The greatest trick ever played on people is fighting for your borders. Borders are sold of being something there to protect us, this isnt true the borders are there to control,and tax us, and they sell it a patriotism. Id not serve now kowing what i know as a 40 somthing .
You can remover the monarchy, the politicians and nothing will change, the bent slime balls that run everything, will still be running things, but they will cover it, hide it from you, keeping a tight grip on everything. Good luck with trying to change things though, I’m all for it.
BOYCOTT THE CORONATION!!!
You are very good indeed at imposing your prejudices on history..
When is charles paying his herance tax.that we have to pay.
It’s not just the king that must fall ….it’s all five families that must fall to fix humanity…the British (German) monarchy, the Saudi (9-11 attacks to cover stealing all the Gold bullion in the federal reserves) , the Chase(helped kill your dreams of owning land) family, the Rockefeller’s (planned to poison you in every single way), Goldman/Sach family….and a bonus the Wall or Wal  family (that literally killed so many small businesses they bankrupted one quarter of Americans and 7/8ths of all businesses in America) they are all traitors to humanity plotting thins like 9-11 to hide the theft of the last of the 2 Trillion in Gold Bullion left in Federal Reserves …these people have an old plan they started doing in 2019 but planned in 1950 to kill …7.5 Billion people and since 2019 they’ve killed 1.5 Billion people wake up don’t matter if you love, hate, fight or work directly for them …. If you aren’t blood they want you dead . Period the single largest mass murder/Ethnic cleansing/War Crime is happening now in front of our faces …and we’re allowing them to do it and almost our entire senior government knows and is helping…them kill us …
Well done 👏 but unfortunately the masses are easily distracted
The meek shall inherit the earth..the so called elite are so inferior to the beauty of the soul of the common man..I always laugh when they wear all their "medals"
Stolen valour if joe public do it we have to earn rank in army they get given rank
Who is paying for the coronation, not the tax payee again.
Pozdrawiam serdecznie i życzę miłego dnia
🤔🤔🤔🤯Con-ceited con-serve themselves parasites the devil 🤥lies cheats ,steals and  destroys hence why he needs allegiance 😂😂😂where as God almighty doesn't gave you all freewill to choose and learn which path is better one of love &truth righteous and wisdom or one of corruption ,death & destruction better to choose wisdom above above all else !! than manmade created 🐂/💩👍🏽🙄🙏💜
How many have they had killed for that crown
I am not a Royalist, I detest Charles BUT if we don't have King Charles III we will inevitably get President Blair. Hard to say which would be worse.
They are all part of the WEF. They are hellbent on pop ula tion reduction and total tyranical control for those  few who remain in this world after 2030.
You got paid by the British tax payers. Please return all money received including your pension. Thank you.
Hahaha.... Another one with a gripe on the shoulders whilst moaning filling a sandbag! I am a former soldier, and served over 16 years with operational tours, and you are talking out your arse, they are born to be in that position, from the history of our land. Sadly you and others are now proposing a new order similar to what Trotsky forecasted and Lenin wanted in ideology. The old socialist ways you decried about, yet now yearn for. The Royal Family are the heads of the country keeping parliament in check, otherwise it would be ruined by a senate or government in corruption or global takeover. Look at wonderful USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, France and now Germany to say the least; new laws being put into action prevention of protest, speech, movement, anti Russian and Chinese acts, combined with using NATO as a cover to force aggressive actions in military aid and bases procurement. Obviously you haven't swung the lamp yet, nor have to had a bigger tactical G1 picture 👊😂😂😂👊
If the monarchy goes we should stop at the Prime Minister. No president, otherwise it's just a title change. The royal family are just a bauble, they have no real power now, the real problem is the traitor politicians who are allowing in all the immigrants etc. It's the politicians who keep us poor. It's laughable to think that if we get rid of the monarchy we'll all become equal and get a share, it would all be still owned by the wealthy, just the ones who work behind the scenes with real power. The system won't change unless they are tackled.
Why have any monarchy?
Divide & Conquer , as old as the planet in which we reside! Pecking orders centuries old . The atrocities brushed over . The British history isn’t really taught , it’s merely cherry picked . The Monarchy front and centre to it all 🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
*_NOT MY KING_*
My home is my castle where I am king. So if every male in the world is king and female is quenn of their own castle. What gives these retards the right to own any more then anyone else. Thanks Mate love your truthful summation of the real truth. 👍
Would Council house residents want them next door?
I hope Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and England remain together as one trading Republic with what remains of our Commonwealth but without a useless monarchy. John Eric Hoare. Brexiteer and British, Australian, and Norwegian deep seaman retired.
I like  the way that the Sex Pistols were mentioned here with Sid Vicious. Well Sid Vicious rose from lowly protest song writer to establishment figure so hardly a role model for the anti monarchist is he
Totally agree
Andrew was caught out because he was friends with Jeffrey Epstein yet no one ever mentions Charles’ friendship with Jimmy Saville. They’re all weirdos 🤮
When I joined the army in the 70s we swore allegiance to the queen in the recruiting office...later...on the morning of our passing out parade, we had to do it again in our troops of 30 odd squaddies...my lips moved but no words came out...is that treason?
Well said sir❤
So Joe, when you were in Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia and your oppos were fighting in Iraq and Afghan, can you tell us the age of the hookers you were knobbing and what kind of drugs you were getting over there. Because there is a touch of the Gary Glitter about you.
I take it you are not a Royalist! 😂
Love them or hate them it's your decision.
To much bitterness
Viva la Republica
✌
When the Queen died so did monarchy,no great loss
The French got rid of their royal family to make way for federal reserve to take over the country if you really research it….
These elett royal people look at us as cockroaches,if they think the people will kneel for them they are delusional, the royal family work for the people,and what a disgrace these leeches who belong to the world economic forum are
Eactly||||
Spoken like a true republican !
😂😂agree✌️
Great video
🎉🎉
I think the older generation get some kind of warm fuzzy buzz from romanticising the Royals, the kids coming up now see nothing but inequality and injustice for themselves, they no long can afford to buy a house like their parents and grandparents, they have to pay for their education and amass huge debts, but when they finish find nothing but low wages and exploitation. I don’t think the Royals have a future.
Cromwell was a wealthy man who wanted to protect his class interests
The WIndsors are not even English. They are German. Have fun.
This King of yours is a murderer.  In particular, he kills those of color.  None of this is based on his intelligence, as his is typical of his kind...little intelligence but tons and tons of greed.  A pure racist that is what this so called 'King' is.
Sooooo much honesty ! 😊
Could not agree more, with all of this
Well done , you said it ALL .
What a bitter, sad person you are. To whom, or what do you owe any allegiance?  You accepted payment for military service without thinking things through as any mature person would have done and now you are criticising. Just like Harry. I feel sorry for you!
i do not like charles but this is ridiculously over the top.
Funny thing is, Cleese and Rotten are world class boot-lickers nowadays
Wow, Comoe on Doube Down News (or not News) 8 minutes waiting for the expose and nothing. 5 minutes before the first fact, the beheading of King Charles. The rest just a bunch of opinions. I wouldn't class myself as a monarchist but you'll have to do better than that to convince anyone.
Ask fergies,she will tell you they murdered diana,as she was her confidant. Andrew fergies ex was involved with Jeffery eastern out of fl,who had a island they flew in young girls who were molested a,drugged and worse,Andrew was involved with. It why Fergie divorced andrew,he could never be faithful, charles brother,as they were similar  that way
My TV is off as always these  days he'll never be my king any of them what a joke people still go along with it.
When the Russian royal family were assassinated, the British monarchy was apparently in danger of losing popularity and were worried about a similar fate. But they managed to pull back popularity and escaped a overthrowing , apparently, I heard that on a documentary, somewhere
I use go be a Royalist, I'm not now, nor have been for the last 12 years, I don't hate or love them, I don't care one way or another about them. I'm in different.
Ooo I had a go at archery over the weekend and it felt good...we definitely need another robin hood 🏹
Charles 11 was the first salaried employee of the bank on 1000 guineas/ mth. !!!
I think the royal family adequately represent modern Britain....adulterous, paedophiles,  racist, parasitic
Crazy how this would of been treason leading to an execution centuries ago
I cant believe how many people are actually planning parties...v dissapointing
Just remember how gullible and easily manipulated the general public are! Remember the “big event” in 2020? Look how the masses switched off any form of basic critical thinking and just followed the herd!
Put them in a council 🏠 yes thats what happens in the Queen & I by sue tousend its hilarious 😆
I totally agree with you 💯 percent. This poxy weekend is going to cost US more   money than it is worth. Here, we all are struggling to pay our bills, and the government is spending our money on this stupid event, I hope it rains hard all day Saturday.
LAWFUL REBELLION ---- ARTICLE 61 MAGNA CARTA 1215 ---- THIS IS YOUR RIGHT   LET IT BE AS IT WAS IN 1688 ---- TAKE THEM DOWN, WE THE PEOPLE ❤‍🔥💣
If we become a republic what would change? Would the countries that make up the UK go their separate ways? And how would it affect our quality of life?
They have it all. We are many they are few. It’s a clever trick. They use young working class men to protect themselves. The police and army. Working class men protecting the elites from their own parents, siblings and children.
aint no king to me- who or what is he king of??? He's just like his brother Andrew....  Its all about to collapse, its already crumbling like sand castles on the beech
I agree we need a republic but not a communist dictatorship as we all know how that works out
.Another WOKE Lefty . Its a wonder you joined the army ? with your  Lefty Attitude , You talk a load of rubbish
I have always said that the biggest disaster that this country ever suffered was when the Norman's won the Battle of Hastings and introduced the feudal system. If this had not happened then I believe we would now have more in common with the Scandinavian countries rather than still having an entitled ruling class.
UK citizens are still treated as the subjects. In a real democracy people should become better off, not just the very rich.
Down with the king.
Throw them out and they willbe replaced  with another bunch of the same , just look at America.
They live in the biggest council house in the UK. Scroungers!
There is corruption everywhere. You just have to pick your team, then live (or die) with your choice.
"Put them in a council house and tell them to get a job" is the reality show Andy will be appearing in soon on his rehabilitation tour.
Former Australian soldier here. The entire Royal family is filth to their core. I would never again celebrate, serve or even acknowledge their disgusting existence.
Monarchy in one word parasites
Thats because the public thrives on trivia and gossip to try to colour their empty lives! J.
I agree w/ you 👍👍His mother, the late queen was so respectable. and low profile 👏👏👏👏
Oh come on (from BC, Canada) Charles was always an environmentalist, so OFC he's gonna rewild Britain, switch medical model to Homeopathy & shift it to prevention, end petrol use & so on, no?
Just the thought of the amount of Brits we know will be dutifully waving their union jack flags at a man who couldn't give a flying f about any one of them & thinks theyre all peasant scum, makes me sick to my stomach. The royals are greedy grifting B's who dont care if millions are living in poverty , starving or freezing to death . F every single one of them , especially the adulterers Charles & Cowmila ...
Pathetic. We know where Charles' loyalty lay but a monarchies needed in a triumvirate government, as we are. Get rid of the King and the Lords, then who do you think is running the country?! A dictatorial government with no oversight, remember Covid, when the government ignored it's legal responsibilities in making laws, with no oversight? That's what your asking for.  Simpletons.
Uncollerated  arguments I often hear - nurses pay, French being cool is NOTHING to do with royal family and everything to do with government.  Put it this way - if we had no royal family - would we see any difference to anything…NO.  You need stronger arguments
I don't really care if we keep it or ditch it since im apolitical. But I don't agree in regards to the English Civil war. That event isn't a revolution like the French revolution or the American Revolution. The English civil war was a war about religious division not, republican ideals. I have no idea why Republicans like to cite that historical event to match with their views. The King was not executed because the principle or concept of a hereditary monarch was ludicrous, or people were starting to realise, or wake up or anything. It was in regards of matters over the church of England and religious division. Cromwell wanted a strict puritian state. And the king was clearly sympathetic to catholic sentiments and had constantly made mistake after mistake especially in regard to Scotland. The parliamentarians did not want to get rid of the king initially. They just wanted him controlled. They even offered to make Cromwell a king. But cromwell preferred his title as lord protector and he passed it onto his son. So even cromwell was still trying to create some form of a hereditary monarch. The rump was a half assed version of a republic. So although that event has elements of a republic they are entirely unintentional. The civil war was another war defined by the roots of religious intolerance and division. While those other events like the American revolution and french revolution were in response to inequality and a want for freedom against a governing system they oppose and it involved the people. English civil war was still limited to a particular class of people of, parliamentarians vs the royalists.
Preech my guy they cant stop us the truth always overcomes lies
Absolutely cant stand the Windsor's
NWO TRAITOROUS FILTH who embraces a paedophilic evil religion and is forcing it on us along with WEF
They say hes the Antichrist in the last book of the bible,  revelation ( or otherwise known as the apocalypse)also the book o Daniel chap 11 old testement which has also the new world ORDER prophesy to happen , ..beleive in the LORD Jesus Christ the true king, he is king of kings and LORD of lord's,  and you will have untold pleasures in heaven , you will never die and not be in hell.
Banks and tax,s are the oldest scam to take your money
Your a hater
Rumblings of a repeat of the Romanovs.
Your correct, couldn't give a shit about the family or the coronation, we care about putting food on table and fuel in tank so we can go to work to pay bills to do it all over again. We need something to change.  Cromwell had his faults but no doubt a true legend they keep a statue of him down in Parliament by House of commons and a statue of the king charles the one he beheaded at trafalgar Square (Believed to be the very centre of london) says alot for symbolism doesn't it.    Be careful bud words are dangerous and these are dangerous times.
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿As in the words of SCOTLANDS BRAVEHEART,  William Wallace dragged on foot from Scotland to England said , " How can I be guilty of treason when England is FOREIGN to me " ." Never in my whole life did I pledge allegiance to HIM."( king Edward) Then they hung drawn and quartered him  cut ting off his privates, taking out his heart while he was still alive , and  the lungs, and guts ect, cut his head off and stuck it on London bridge.🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Then to add insult Edward the English king nicked the stone of destiny and took it to England and they are gonna crown king Charles on it, he talks to his plants for goodnes sake.
The best video I have seen on this subject
21st century and the Brit's still play with their "Royal" toys. GROW UP!
Bloody good get rid of the lot of em.Biggest bunch of thieves ever been born.
The TV interviewed one of those twats camping on the route early and I recognised him... he floats about the reduced for quick sale food sections in Croydon.  I watched him tell customers how nice certain items were and that they should buy them, and he tried to do the same to me. I put him right. So, in short... they are fucking oddballs.
“Vive la République !”  😔you are right. In Spain we hardly study our first Republic, crushed by the fascist in the civil war.. Later people accepted a French origin , idiotic promiscuos , prigger king (Juan Carlos I )  Englands monarchy has a parallelism , like all , they protect each other. it’s like a virus in modern society.
My Hart was full of joy listening to you. I have been saying the same thongs for years, with others telling me I'm wrong when it's so clear to see.
He said it right THE INBRED ELITE, ABSOLUTELY GOOD FOR NOTHING, SPONGING OFF THE TAX PAYERS , KING EARS IS A CLOWN
I just read £250,000,000 for coronation. How disgusting g this day and age when his supposed subjects are starving and homeless still. Infill boycott the TV that day.
Aren’t all royalties acting like gangsters ? 😂😂😂 it’s not all Britain.
Just a point: I agree with most of what you say, but I would add that the church is as big a bunch of crooks, The two organisations are as bad as each other.
I cant pledge allegiance to Charles when he pledges allegiance to Davos
Wow
You are very disrespectful, can you do a better job regardless of who he is the have been doing a excellent job for hundreds of years isn't there a better subject you can teach the public positively. Thanks
A 75 year old friend of mine has rented his house from Charles for over 50 years, he has no central heating, never even been asked if he'd like it installing.
It is co founder of the w e f    and advocate of depopulation.   and hes proud of it
Thank you brother, this has made me feel less alone.
Socialists like this soldier never mention Charles’s affiliation with the Globalist  WEF. Why, because socialists ARE globalists. Socialists despise rivals to power … the church, the family and dissidents. I’m a monarchist but not THIS monarchy.
Well done pal, ill be wearing my sex pistols t shirt on sat...im 60 now and when at school age 11 i questioned why we had the monarchy. Got sent straight to the headmaster's office. Still not changed my opinion. Well done pal👊👊
What is he going to be king of? And Camilla? Chairs of the Estate which means the Bankers in London.
Some of us left and will never come back
To them we are nothing but ‘Free range tax slaves’   We are not from the left.  We are not from the right.  We are from the bottom and We are exposing those on the top.   All men are equal under god.
I don't trust Charles
Whilst royalty is politically neutral they are a bonus.  But Charles is beginning to back globalist ideals. 52 % of the population voted for Brexit a populist ideal. So he is against more than half his subjects.  I have changed my view on Charles since he endorsed the Windsor Agreement a betrayal of Brexit.
They owned the east india tea company which was resposible hurrendous acts
Nice one mister❤.  ........and just to rub salt into our wounds,...slag queen Camilla!....really?
I pledge my allegiance to my selections on itv racing on sat afternoon. Not grubby fingers
Love your take on this issue. Proud to say my daughters, both in their 20's are even more antimonarchist than I am. Which is not a low bar nor indeed, Croquet hoop to navigate.
We need to be careful. Yes monarchy is an outdated feudal system, but unless we completely overhaul our political system we are on a slippery footing. We need a rotating people's assembly where what's best for the country, its people, fauna, flora and environment matters more than a politician or a political party. Then we have safeguards in place and no room for an inherited monarch.
Shut up mate
Not my king. If we had a true noble monarchy I would be for them, but not these usurpers, chameleons, shapeshifters! JESUS CHRIST is my King. he came to serve and was rejected by the powers that be, on His return He shall be the all conquering King, and every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall confess. He is the Saviour of the world, not charlie boy, have you seen the statue dedicated to him. titled the saviour of the world? He is anything but a Christian! Lord have mercy on him for he knows not what he does, Amen
The King Is Direct Desencded of Stavila, How on Hell God Je Be Good?
YOU ARE 100% CORRECT ON ALL COUNTS, THANKS.
Oh yeah I want to be French, life there is so good. Another porous and populist does of claptrap from ddn. Go lay in a ditch with talk TV and whatever Richard Tice is selling
Totally agree waste of money on that  lot  and people homeless and starving
"The British: so proud, yet so eager to serve".....
Their a redundant anachronism, belonging in the books on history.
Best post about this evil coronation. You really tore him a 2nd hole.
Nice edit of Godard's Le Mempris 1960. If you wanna know what's coming Day of the Locust 1975 Schlesinger. The 2nd most shocking ending in 70s cinema according to one wag. Shot on a lunatic scale. There ain't no Locust in it. Replaced my all time favourite of 8 years Melville / Un Flic 1973.
👍👍 spot on! Charles apparently is the fourth horseman of the apocalypse. Goes so much deeper than we realise. They are part of the cabal, pure evil!
6.6 million acres owned by the Royal Family... how many acres for me? - zero. not even one?  How many have YOU got?   and they need taxes?
His mother denied her oath ( Stone of Scoone removed) and it will be fingers crossed for Charlie on the 6th. Vile family. Restore the true descendent of King Arthur. The discovery of his grave was placed on a D notice - a threat to the Windsor Saxe Coburgs.
People should not be bowing and scraping to anyone in this day and age.
Prince Philip always made me laugh… one day he would wear an Admirals uniform the next day  a Field Marshals, every day is a fancy dress day with the Royals…. Do you get the picture?
No gods. No kings. No masters.  Only humans
Countries could be fed with their tiaras!  The crown jewels just sit there - their value could help so much homelessness and hunger - help so many children - the orphans!  Look at all their castles and lands!  Just sit there!  These could be used for so much good for people!  It is disgusting - all their wealth just for their privilege!  I think it's  sickening! And all the money for this Coronation!  It absolutely  wrong! WRONG! SHAMEFUL!
"Dose anyone knows where the light is?" they say...each time are selling our children 4 adoption Payments or making profit from people inheritance. 🤔 "Spear" True, you made me cry, because I know how truly you are for the last 27 year living in U.K./G.B,  Kent ♡♧☆ God to give you grate health and will for naming the truth!♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡¡¡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡¡¡¡¡♡♡♡¡¡¡¡¡¡♧♧♧♧♧♧♧♧♧☆☆☆☆☆▪︎▪︎▪︎▪︎▪︎▪︎"The Executionists!" Facts and historic acts speak out the truth! This British Royal Family are Bavarian originally... Mind you,  King CHARLES III is a great guy:" dose anyone knows where the light is?" , he quoted.  Better a funny demented incestuous person King as him, or none at all! Spot on ♡! Very sad! We call them Kookoxklan in England &Romania
£100 million for the coronation of King Charles….  Mind you how long would £100 million last paying for hotels to house illegal immigrants?  Neither are necessary but …?
Im a Canadian  ... yet I'm not for the monarchy.  They are the biggest welfare recipients in the world! I think it's  very wrong!
Charlie obviously has either A) an issue with his…tissues, or B) a heart condition by the looks of those fingers
As a European from republic country I am finding it bizarre to see this British subjects cheering this royals clowns on whilst many of that country citizens struggle.
You think your country should move away from the Monarchy - imagine how stupid we Australians are for retaining your King as our Head of State!!!
Sooo refreshing to hear these things out of another humans mouth , buddy. And there’s more…much more.
Great video enlightening the true nature of this despicable man who hides behind a sea and hierarchy structure of privilege where deception is the only thing keeping it together. The truth is coming fast!
Look at Harry, he'd be lucky to get a job stocking shelves at Walmart he's so thick and yet he had £40 million pounds (until that prostitute he married spent it all).  At least I'd have more respect for him if he did have a job.   A recent poll said only 40% wanted Charles to be king and only 30% wanted Camilla, to be queen.   Camilla acknowledged, in her youth, she was going to break her great grandmother, Alice Kepple's record. Her peers, at that time, said of Alice, "She has the morals of an alley cat in heat" and Camilla spent her youth doing exactly the same thing.   Yet she had Charles full permission to tease, taunt and bully a beautiful, young, naive virgin bride. Now, Diana has been dead these last twenty five years and a harlot has taken her place.   I have been praying and imploring the Almighty to STOP that Coronation!   Those two don't have enough morals between them to fill a thimble half full!
I'm not a monarchist but I am scared of the alternative. I couldn't stomach a President Blair or President Johnson. Can you imagine it: President Abbot... ffs!
Magen and Harry will hire u as a bodyguard 😂
Yay, "Off with his head!" LoL 😂 * Throws rotting fruit * From Down Under 🤣
So an ex soldier who signed allegiance to the queen and Royal family. Whose salary, clothing, food, housing all paid for by the British taxpayers, now slags off the Royal family, and at the same time the tax payer. Hypocrisy at its best, a man with no morals at all, and a joke of a man
Well said.
D'accord!!!
"... bunch of LARPers" haha noice :)
Sorry to say this  friend ...but ALL hierarchical systems, structures,  groups, corporations, regimes, doctrines, cults, cartels, nations and empires ......are ALL rivalling and/or colluding human made "Master and Minion" ponzi pyramid schemes...but  some hierarchies are so established, entrenched and seem so normalised,  passive, friendly and benign....that most minions only notice and point fingers at other more direct, brutal, fundamentalist, ruthless or tyrannical people and their corrupt and sleazy ponzi schemes ...that  serve, enrich, elevate and empower a 1% who subjugate milk and exploit all they can, until they cant. ....all whilst pretending to smug, or noble or self  righteous.
The whole point of the fascist regime is that the people are also fascist? They cannot be separated? British history is a complete white lie! Until this is realised, this Country cannot move on! The Sovereignty of Britain is fake! As well as all of their so called territories.  The fact is freemasons keep this secrecy and are riddled in this fake society. The truth is out there if You look hard enough? It is essential these people are removed completely! The true Sovereignty of this Country is black jewish territory, and the fake jews have no place in this bloodline! King charles was murdered for the sake of a kingdom that ruled for centuries, because they were black! The nazi fakes need to go back to Russia were they come from!👨🏾‍🎓
The royal who? They're a laughing stock .
😅Honestly folks. They have a minuscule fraction of wealth and power compared to the unfettered forces of the military industrial complex, CIA, business titans like the Kochs, global corporations, dictators, oil sheiks, Chinese, Russian elites. It's silly to focus our fears on an institution that legitimately seeks to advance the British. Come on.
Who in their right mind would pledge alligence to a septuagenarian, jug-eared twat?
It's almost as if the inexplicable destruction of an armoured, bullet-proof Mercedes in Paris, followed by an inexplicably delayed ambulance journey, wasn't an accident.
yes thats right ...the  ussr  ,Cambodia ,vietnam ,north Korea ,Venezuela and china and others had and has a much better system of government than the crown with a parliament. They cared about and respected their people a whole lot more , the 120 million dead didn't really want to stick around anyhow so that's ok............ um wait a minute...
Cmon folks. Yes we need to curtail their power. But England's royalty is UNIQUE. I genuinely believe Charles, William and Kate act out of duty. Not greed. They stand between us and total American corporate domination. Most of our increasing inequality is due to American influence. Not traditional English values.
Pigs in blue protect this scum and the whole rotten system, a crime syndicate....
OFF WITH HIS HEAD
I agree to a huge degree with your argument.  However, what despot would then rule this country? One who can make laws….. Just look at our government for a clue
I just have to ask. King Charles becomes the head of the Church of England. Erm, how does that square as he is a philandering, lying, petulant and infantile twit. Or does the Church of England now advocate those traits? The main thing that IS happening and everyone on all sides has to accept, is that Charles has far, far less regard from the public than the Queen. Will Charles stupidity, which started with this absurd pledge of allegiance, be fundamental in ending the current monarchy as it stands. Add to this the clear understanding that the entire royal setup are racist bigots.
As a down to earth American🇺🇸 there were/are things I liked about the monarchy and especially Queen Elizabeth.  On the one hand I enjoyed the pomp, the ceremony, the castles, the horses, the history, etc.  But on the other hand, I couldn’t help but wonder why the Queen didn’t sell a silly crown 👑 or two 👑 and put that money towards something IMPORTANT, that would help her people…?  The pensioners are first to come to mind.. then the Veterans, the homeless, youth programs, etc, etc.  When Prince William becomes King, if he “slimmed down” the monarchies WEALTH, and shared it with the people, he would go down in history as the most loved Monarch of the. all.
Charlie is actually a descendant of Vlad the Impaler and even owns properties in Transylvania. Says it all really. 🦇
You might want to l99k at the ammount of tourists that arrive in the country and spend money .
They have done nothing but cause trouble for centuries here and abroad .the Americans through  that us here in Britain had a life of Riley when they were over in the americas robbing and taking off those there.while in reality those crims were fucking us over too ,centuries before 1776 in fact .Edward the 1st another bstard robbing and taking lands in Scotland and wales for their grubby gain..king John ,taxing folk living in hovels in forests and woods ..they mean nothing to me .just a bunch of greedy money grubbing parasites.robbing the English welsh Scot’s and Irish for bloody centuries ..now we’ve got the government as well robbing us blind to go with them .
British establishment should go
They represent the government. They do the government's work, so I wouldn't pin everything on particular royal family for that. They get send by the government for these arms deals etc and yet the populace voted for Johnson and the other clowns now and the past ones.
Coronation is brainwashing at its best. A type of scam where you feel like its your distant family its catfishing. I know it probably make sense my comment but its all cryptic.
We love u.❤❤❤❤❤
Ah yes, we should follow the french route. Coz they have zero issues int whit country with a president. Not sure what this wank stain being ex army has to do with being an authority on the royal family. I’m ex army, I say they are great. There you go, 2 opposing views perfectly balanced out apparently
Couldn't agree more, an archaic ancient con...the British Royal family are a bunch of tax dodging, low-life grifters.
The digital I'd they want to lumber us with is more important then this. Always say NO.
A very succinct argument and thought provoking and well researched with British wit!
They worshipped that 🤡and mobsters institution.
As an Australian, PC lacks pc, he is not an attractive person and lacks an understanding of how real people are suffering and he just wants to control.
I’ll be praying .. the Lord’s Prayer to save us from the Evil King !
£100 million to put a pretty hat on a little millionaire's head and we are expected to be delighted by this.  My gas supply was disconnected two months ago and I recently had three weeks without electric.  I think it's definitely time to reintroduce Madame Guillotine.
They represent the height of human achievement.....the exact opposite of you 😅  Why you have zero understanding of what the Constitutional Monarchy system represents is if no interest to me.....wallow in your ignorance.  I didn't finish your ignorant video, so I have no clue what your idealistic, utopian delusion is, and quite frankly, I don't give a sh*t.
You can't have a democratic army.  What are you going to do  when you have to fight the enemy or put down traitors? Have a vote on it first?
blah blah blah blah, gosh...
Blar Blar Blar. Buy my book. Pathetic.
Why do you think they pushed the green agenda so much because it makes them billions the wealth they amass is obscene
I went into Tesco and they had cardboard cut outs of a cinderella type carriage. It's vile to think Jimmy Savilles best mate is celebrated like this.
He's not going to reign long 🤔😉
so true!
WEF just another Regime...
Quite apart from the historical aspects of the monarchy, so well covered in this Youtube clip, Charlie Boy and his Fancy Woman are NOT fit and proper persons to be Heads of State of Great Britain and the British Commonwealth.  The whole Coronation charade is an affront to democracy and freedom.
I don't think I've ever heard so much whiney whinging nonsense in my life.
The older I get, the more I appreciate tradition but not the tradition of the RF as it is.  Charles is a neo-feudalist and I, like so many don't like or trust him.  Other European Royals still open hospitals and do ceremonial stuff but they don't have all the priviledges of the UK Royals.  I might have thought it to carry on for bit had Charles abdicated but I think time to draw a line under the RF.
Wow. I am astonished to find someone who hates Chuckie and his inbred family more than I do. That's rare. Were he born into a more civilized and enlightened world he would have had a marvelous future in animal control.
Fully agree. All monarchies are criminal organizations stealing money, sending others to die for their greed, allowing people to starve and suffer while they enjoy daily buffets, always beyond the law. They're a stain upon humanity, utterly unworthy of the deranged fealty that so many others show them. Get rid of them and take back the money and assets that they've undeservedly benefitted from for centuries.
Essentially they are at a council house Buckingham Palace is paid by the taxpayer‘s or at least a large percentage of it is
Well said !!!!
Totaly agree with you mark  its time we had democracy here with the end of the royals and  PR voting
Question.   Charles  arrives  in his para  uniform.  . And is he  kernal in chief??  Has he earned  them wings.?  Has he jumped  from  aeroplanes    in orderto wear them para  wings on his beret. And arm?????? In other words  does he have  the right  to wear that uniform?????
The elevation of one is the lowering of everyone else.
I don't agree, getting rid of the monarchy would have zero effect on people's quality of life. You would still have the government. As for France ha, when's the last time you looked.
Absolutely true 👍
These are the real parasitical diseeases we need a vaccine against ..
Anyone who's part of W.E.F will never be good for our country . We will have a king and prime minister who are very closely connected with the world economic forum. We are already in a country that is on the edge of the precepiss .with all the insanity in this country we need no more.
As far as I'm concerned, the Royal family need to be permanently exported.
The error that Watt Tyler made was to think a 13 year old King was as innocent as the 13 year olds he knew.
I agree with you about the elites nearly owning all the land, But at the same time I'd hate think what it end up looking like if we were all allowed to walk on it and use it
he won't fall for 3.5 years...he is antichrist (mary j)
Great video. Showing the darkside of never complain , never explain as long as the vast amounts of money is coming in. Although I like to think I am a Royalist, it may be the fact of the brainwash job, the same as millions over decades. But I have to ask myself have I ever seen a bigger looking prat than Charles when crowned by mummy as the Prince of Wales. Again the Queen was the Queen because were told so, but her record on being a mother, as such, by what she has grown, or what her sons have grown into, is questionable. The monarchy through media have shown what they are, and it is not looking good as to who much longer their fairytale of silence will work.
Illegal economic migrants cost UK taxpayers billions a year in hotels, benefits, healthcare and housing. I know which I'd rather have
I'd be up for a real monarchy.
proceeds of crime all of it .the public would get the lot taken and get get sent to jail.its like we live in medievil times
FUCKING BRILLIANT. THANK YOU. CAN THE BBC, STOP THIS TIRADE OF FALSE LOVE ????
Britain could use a lesson in natural law and how God is the only authority, then the common man, and authority is not those that believe they are gods on earth.
Tell us summat we didn't know. Well said anyway!
things are all hunky dory in Macronic yellow vest France …. I wouldn’t tout their set up as the answer …. plus where I live in London is swamped with French middle class exiles
A bloody brilliant description of those prevaricators, they actually disgust me, those lazy parasitic leeches  have never done a day's work in their grubby lives, King Charles is a laughable creepy Crawley. DOWN WITH THE CROWN
Oh mate, how refreshingly honest and spot on. Well done.
U r not a winner, the royal was,they are the important part of history and culture of this great country which is unique in this world and should be proud of it.
I got kicked out of Windsor Castle for asking one of the security about a collection of Jewel encrusted knives, that said ‘ACQUIRED IN CHINA IN 1840’ I said do you mean STOLEN! What makes me sick is Prince William is one of the owners of SERCO, who are housing all the illegals…and WE pay for him!
Charles is another WEF stooge.
people are so thick ,all of the so called royals eat and crap the same as every one else they are just skin and bone , the only thing they do different is the suck of the poor to live better .
Monarchy=pedophiles
Oh dear, another socialist that thinks the world owes him a living... power to the people brother... what a load of crap.
Aren't the royals still ruling even though they pretend they don't.
Only one King Jesus
why do ex-squaddies always have to say theey were a squaddy as if it means something special.
Unfortunately, if you get rid of the king as head of state , what do you end up with? Perhaps, another Muslim leader like the Mayor of London or like in Scotland 😮
Is that including the pope?
Yes but Charles agrees with Klaus Schwab the world has to leave oil and gas in the ground and we all must (temporarily) drive EVs until the masses must only get around on mass transit.And we must all get rid of our gas stoves and stop eating meat.I’m sure these elites will follow suit,at least turn the thermostat down in their palaces and castles.
Just reading about the Levellers and the New Model Army. A great opportunity missed and look where we are 400 years later. Sorry, I never saw the Sex Pistols as anything more than a publicity stunt.
I'll be pledging NO allegiances on Saturday. 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
The fact that as taxpayers we can't opt out paying for this absolute nonsense makes me sick. We've got, nurses and doctors who are being paid practically pennies, yet the taxpayer is expected to front the bill for this gobshite.
I'll always be proud to be an Englishman and a royalist, purely because our monarchy is one of the few remaining entities we have in this country that symbolizes a unique sense of national identity and pride, in a time where such things are universally branded with a big pile of labels ending in 'ist' and 'phobe' by the so called 'progressives' in our society. God save our king.
All you people should be ashamed of yourselves. You are lucky to have a long standing successful beauty monarchy and need to stop complaining like big ass babies.
Well, monarch may fall once the king passes.  But yes how can the country partake in the carnation at the tax payers expense when we are already living hand to mouth! We are losing our homes, subject to higher bills, interest rates 😢
The French led the way! The english revolution has been deliberately undermined and defeated, by the old royalists. They have buried our past history. They favour opportunism, and greed. Profits before everything else. Ordinary people have been disregarded. The word socialism and it's middle ground great popularity, virtually  eradicated from all media, from history. It's been a heist of mentality, of awareness, of direction, and of political self determination.
Some become Kings while many are not & this is life = the best thing to do is to be good & leave all judgment to GOD!
I pledge all Leed's ants, to the King.   No, I didn't say "allegiance", and my v2t do me dirty. I swear that King Charles is welcome to every ant in Leeds, or even under the city.
Oliver Cromwell was sponsored by the Satanic Khazarian Mafia who still pose as Jews.  Britain has been ruled by them ever since King Charles 1st was executed. The current royal family also derive from a Khazarian bloodline and are puppets to the Rothschilds as part of the global, satanic elite podophile network.
What are  ''The Royalty''? They are the descendents of the biggest gang of lying, cheating, conniving, thieving, murdering, inbred crooks that ever walked the planet. Everything they own was stolen, or was bought with the proceeds of theft. The sooner they are gone, the better. That only then needs the reform and removal of the crooks in Parliament to complete the job. .
So the monarchy are willing accomplices in how they are being used, purporting to be public servants, but are actually doing the bidding of whom?? These war industries you mention right ?! . So who's really in charge and pulling the strings if the royalty are just the nodding compliant poodles ??!  Are part of the  ever so civilised charade, the masquerade that is used to subdue the masses. Who is running this masquerade, selling it, foisting this sycophantic servitude upon a numbed powerless populace. Brainwashed into compliance, powerlessness and inequality. Who ?? Some very rich elites?! So the royals are just pawns, showcase puppets for a game being played upon well meaning people. That fleeces us all. It's a charade.
Windsor is a made up name.
Very well said mate. They are at best an expensive anachronism, at worst, as you say, ruthless gangsters. Let's not forget the opium wars, the Royal Assent, the secret power they still possess. The Crown jewels, if sold, could feed thousands, house thousands. The Monarchy needs to go. Sell them to Disney.
I agree with everything you said. The Monarchy has been,and still is absolutely disgusting. 🍁🍁🍁
The monarchy is the correct system, but they should live in a semi detached house in Rochdale & the first sign of a scandal (as with Andrew) should be a sackable offence.
THE GUY IS A ARROGANT WHO CARERS ABOUT THEM KLAUS SHWABS AND CO THE SHADOW GOVERNMENT WHEN THEY KILLED THE QUEEN WAY THAT POISON MANDATED JAB THAT WAS IT ROYAL FAMILY IS OVER ANDREW THE PEDO CHARLES BEST FRIENDS JIMMY SAVILES ROLFE HARRIS CIRAL SMITH ALL ATTENDED QUEENS PARTY'S EVERY YEAR FOR YEARS THEY NO LIARS AND THIEF'S
If you cant see why having a monarchy in todays world is ridiculous, your part of the problem.
Loved this
in my city i have seen one set of bunting - most i talk to have no interest, the msm will say otherwise but the more they say that, the more of the norms wake up to the lies   #notmyking
I totally agree I’m an ex soldier like you mate ex guards and I just wish they would get a proper job I’m so done with them as you get older you just get a better understanding the are total parasites and need to bloody go !
spräng kungahuset
All those lives lost fighting wars for this country, only for Britain to be sold out by the far left Nazis.
his own mother did not give him crown she had no choice and who said queen died she be queen
Were you booted out of the army? You seem to have a chip on your shoulder, and it's boring.
Oh nelly
Blah blah blah / and when the monarchy is ousted then what are flag our traditions / then what / a country that resembles something that people are risking their life’s to cross the channel to escape from / / this fuckin guy is and looks what he is . One of life’s losers it’s classic once these people or peoples realise for want of any reason that they’re life’s didn’t bring them anything due to lack of trying or to grit / they attack the winners / so what if the royal family own palaces and land etc / we should be thanking them for the incredible management over the 100’s of years it’s the envy of the world our monarchy it is and always will be / it’s a world standard something that can’t be pulled down and concreted over /  everyday these fuckin people already /  god save the king and god save and protect Great Britain we and the world owe her soooooo much 👍
Great video mate. I am 70 & deplore this coronation. How dare the Windsors have all this pomp & ceremony and luxury food when this country is in a severe crisis and can not afford to buy much food or other items as the cost of living crisis is biting us all. It makes me puke. Also Camilla she is not my Queen ever she killed Diana as did Charles he is no king good god. Camilla & Charles both did the dirty on Diana & the husband of Camilla. They both need to be sent to the tower and have done with them!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How dare they tell us to have street parties when we can not afford to feed your self properly each day. Having all this pomp & ceremony is a disgrace to so called charles 3rd has he no empathy how we are suffering today. Shame on him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well done, a very well put together video out lining all that is wrong with the monarchy.  Abolish the monarchy.
I love this guy he is saying what I’ve been thinking for decades
Why not direct your anger and hatred towards the real criminals who impoverish people in the UK - the government?  The government is the real decision maker. Charles doesn’t run this country, the Tory party does,  and,  lines the pockets of business shareholders at the expense of working people. If you believe, if we get rid of the monarchy the poor will benefit, no they won’t. The monarchy issue polarises opinions and deflects us away from the real problem - poor government.
We don't know what's worse then the Monarchy or what's crawling around them? The Monarchy must be suported by certain circles of power this is exactly what's the most painful issue and why Monarchy should be Abolished in this country and everywhere where this system still exists.
Aye Sir! I couldn't agree with you more! Thank you for the words of truth you brave to speak. we need more of you and way less of them. I am American but I have eyes!
What a bitter plonker probably discharge as unfit too soldier!
Sorry, who is this guy? Did DDN really publish a bit where this chap says "look at the french they have nice hair and drink cigarettes and are cool because they had a revolution and we're plebs". No wonder the Left is a laughing stock because we continue to publish quasi-bullshit.   Also getting facts wrong. The Royal Family have to pay 80% on tax each year on any profit from their estate, which I know they have dodged in the Panama leaks but on record paid £350 million in the year of 2019. Amazon on the other hand paid nought that year and I am pretty confident some  people here are use that service which is doing more damage to our society and economy than the Royal Family.   People think that once we become a Republic everything will be equal and hunky dory but we'll just have the same shit with a new title that we, the people, who wanted for Brexit and like Coldplay, will vote for, so what's the difference.   At some point they should go but people need to chill out and focus on the what's really creating inequality which are the huge corporations and banks all given graces by our government at the expense of the people. This will bring about change, not abolishing the monarchy which is a total waste of energy.
I love the fact this is trending
Nice one pal.  👍  I bet Charlie wished he had his lifelong friend and marriage Councillor for his big day  ... now then now then jingle jangle jewellery jewellery.    fear not it might be a hot day on Saturday but Andrew will get through  it no sweat. Charlie boy... WEF leader " you will own nothing and be happy".   I bet anal swab will be their along with all the "Knights of the realm?" say no more, nudge nudge wink wink. we are on the knife edge of the biggest depression  ever , and are at point of nuclear destruction and total war in Europe...   wave your flag get on your knees and kiss yours and your future families freedoms away.    😊  lots of love Kenny ❤
The media tells lies of omission, very convincingly and consistently, which keeps the majority blinded to reality.
In Britain you have the royals and aristocricy. In America we have the Hollywood elite,polititions, bankers ect.There has been the undeserving rich for how many thousands of years? The wealthy will not go away . Life is not fair. We need to accept it.
The royal family are responsible for world war 1, Charles-Saville Andrew-Epstein  they're parasites, the French had the right idea  🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Been saying it forever...and his adulterous nasty side  kick...And his green crap is going to hurt more of the peasants then anything ...but not them.
Why don't you move to France?
Totally  agree
Excellent! I'll be in bed at 11am on Saturday, and observing a media blackout all day!
The royal family never ever done a hard days graft, they are ALL literally claiming off the state...ie 'the working people'... They are parasites 'feeding of others'... Dirty,Unscrupulous and Vulgar ... Just look at Andrew... A out & out Nonse and gets away with it...because he's protected by the dark circle's within.!.
Lawful rebellion is allowed under our constitution because he has not sided with the people. He should be pledging alligence to us and renouncing all out side interests. He is not and never will be our king, and we should remove him and his family.
Royalties are simply just criminals under a different name.
Entitled twats,should be treated as so!🤮🙄
I would be more like this towards the house of parliament, If the money wasn't wasted on this, it would be wasted on summit else,
I would defend and applaud your individual right to say whatever you think.  On this topic I think you have so many things wrong its hard to know where to start.   We had our civil war and we all thought the puritans were pants, and fast got our monarchy back.  Other places that have gone Republic have ended with a lot of people dead, and the poor got hit hardest; just ask the French. You wouldn't want me telling you what to do, and I wouldn't want you telling me.  Thankfully, we have the position of a monarchy to stop our common excesses.   You use all the easy arguments, but fail to say that whatever its faults it kind of works for us.  You also fail to provide any alternative that is better,  Most alternatives have rarely worked as they almost always produce little Hitlers and Stalins.  We don't get those. You come over as really chippy, which says more about your own inadequacies.  I think you know you are better than that.
Social media and music industry is controlled brain washing
Always conquest and subjugation using the populus as tools to achieve global domination. Now worldwide governments are in cahoots, fear of losing their 'authority' makes WE the masses the enemy. To revere those that see us as scum is the ultimate act of stupidity.
Having a monarchy isn’t the problem, it’s having a corrupt one like ours.
Many must know & think like this b4 social media days. He speaks truth but its only allowed by a white man. Respect live and admiration for  this real soldier
Does Edward still have the medal for leaving the training barracks In the fastest time?
"The royals bring in money" Yeah, for London.
i'm scottish and my child has to take a day off school for this King's Coronation bull shit  🙄🤨🤯
That's  just your  opinion
Wot crp
Leaders are supposed to provide us with privlage not tax us more wile we stand in a que for a food parcel!! Freedom for Yorkshire ✊ we dont want the rule off cuosin loving, pedo enabling monsters
2.58 to much charlie charlie..........
Can’t stand the sight of the Union Jack. Being British is not so great now
So we should trust you - working class, with communist, socialist trade-unionist leanings in the name of so called egalitarianism. What gives you the right to earn people’s trust by this shallow political analysis? You suffer from Black and White thinking as well as Attribution bias - in this case, class bias and betray the usual working class hatred towards the top dogs of your society. Same blah blah for the past fifty years. Nothing new here but bitching and moaning your lot.
Speaking as a former service woman, you should be ashamed of yourself. If nothing else the royal family bring in more money to the Uk than they cost the tax payer
The idea of a genetically-determined head of state is embarrassing.
Would you like some body like you been up ther in sted
Good to hear an ex soldier state this. Most of my family are ex military, some friends too, some ex special forces, 90% still support the royals.  1) Our royal family are NOT legitimate - they're Guelphs, descended from Loki.  2) Royalists have short memories about Charles III, he drove his first wife mad before she was murdered, he is a Starfire initiate who wanted to be Camilla the gold digger's tampon. He has friends who are nonces. He's a WEF, Bilderberger shill (as is the PoW - eat GM and own nothing and you will be forced to be happy) who also supports the NOE and CCP too. Traitors!   Under common law etc we have sovereignty, not the royals not the government. But who has all the guns? The government, police and military. That's a lever of power.  Voting doesn't work - we have banana republics - petitions don't work, protests don't work. But we have to remain peaceful or they'll use PRS and false flags against us.  Who are the cheese eating surrender monkeys now? The French dig in about a retirement age, we accept 67 yrs, heading towards 70 and the servile sheeple, with bread and circuses carry on chewing the grass!  YouGov come out with propoganda re the Coroabomination as they did re the Plandemic. The BBC are biased in favour of the royals no balanced reviews from them, just sychophantic gushing! Another PsyOp from Chatham House and 77th Brigade.  Makes me feel sick, mind you that could be the infrasound they're using on us on the run up to the Coroabomination.  One judges a country by how it treats it's Wounded, Injured, Sick, Disabled and Poor and by the quality of its communications Eg it's roads. I rest my case!
what I find both fascinating and worrying, is the latest bill on anti protesting, that was indeed ratified by the soon to be king.  so if you're no longer allowed to protest, doesn't this make you a slave?... 12 months prison time now just for protesting.... I imagine thats a max limit, and if you're gonna cause damage to something, but who know if the powers that be might just want to send a rocket up yer arse and give you 3 to 6 months, that jail time will mean no more travelling to the USA on holiday for sure.
Do people not remember when the country was in fear and lock downs etc and there was the Queen with Boris and the EU members all having tea and biscuits and not one was social distancing or wearing a mask..i thought the elderly were at risk..and people still want to put flags up along there street for the king.. Its laughable and stupidity at its best.
And how do you know  any of this I dred to know  was you sat at the table when all this was discussed
windsor mafia be smoking some 420 while going around shooting people with tommy guns
👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀
You have in Britain a long proud tradition of stability second to none largely because of the continuity of the monarchy as part of a set of institutions which balance each other in their roles of state - it is naive to think that directly elected heads of state are a better option since it permits the office of state to be open to the forces of corruption - the UK is almost uniquely shielded from this because of the crown's impartiality - and the current system makes it virtually impossible for tyranny to occur. The monarch is steeped in the traditions and values the position embodies. Finally it should be remembered that even kings and queens must govern with the consent of the people which is why the monarchy is constantly trying to make itself relevant. The Crown is a symbol embodied by a person, when you swear allegiance to the King you are swearing to the Crown and all it symbolises. If you think that turning palaces into public parks and having an elected head of state will enhance the lives of ordinary people then you have failed to notice how the lot of ordinary people in countries with elected heads of state are often much worse - I should know I live in one of them, one of the oldest and most corrupt democracies in the world in fact: Greece
Not people
Here's your anti monarchy artists - https://youtu.be/SyGAeu8aX2A
get a life and get off the bandwagon
The tourism argument is dross. Not because they dont meet the tourists because arguably we would get more tourists if the royals were dead. Look at Versailles. No king, yet attracts an unending stream of tourists. Dead monarch means completely opening Buckingham and windsor to tourism. Doesnt matter if alive or dead the palaces will exist.
That attack on Arabs wasn't expected "those people" humm🤔
Global elites members hiding behind a crown
Put and have your head down in shame
You should be in jail and prison
I don’t see the value in preserving the feudal class system the British Royal family represent. It’s all a waste of money.
England was invaded in 1066 and the lands were divied out, the same People invaded ireland in 1169, the Irish have there Country back, time Eengland did the same.
The gangster family of Britain....spot on
I hope young people will take time and look back and search for the truth
Former British soldier tried to flog a few copies of his book more like. If you don't like the monarchy then fuck off quietly  to live in some tin pot republic FFS.
But doesn't anyone feel compassion for poor Charlie or Camilla?  Surely after years of loyalty to the British country and all they give to this coutry's tourism? I do plead with anyone considering to dissrupt. The reason I ask is that horses and innocent people could be hurt.  I totally agree with your views. But the last thing this country, or any other country, is division. Remember they will divide us in order to conquer
Traitor
mountbatten was his mentor, saville his best mate ...whoever wears allegiance to him , swears allegiance to them ....VILE
I think the Cromwell alternate vicious religious theocracy that tainted the idea of freedom liberty anti-monarchy in the minds of the UK peasants and from what I learned it was peasants KC1 convinced to fight for him and it was more the middle class and lords would wanted him removed.
Most people just looking forward to having a long weekend and drinking and eating with friends and family and doing some form of celebration/games/entertaining!
Not my king..no one rules over me.
Can't feed the people but we feed the machine.
Are English people really going to swear allegiance? All those good English Protestants should remember that the Bible tells them that they should never swear to anyone
Great monologue but missed how IDS & the tories culled god knows (there were still deaths being reported as a result of the policy long after he was forced to revoke it)  how many Brits with benefit sanctions in 2016, only to go onto to give Lizzy & bludgers 350 million of tax payers money to give Buck house a make over.... & fast forwarding to a few months back, how the tax payers was once again diddled out of god knows how much money to pay for the lost profits of Lizzies Regent Streets LOST PROFITS during covid. Like, dafaq.   Otherwise, keep up the good work, keep on fighting. ....The French had the right idea - pity Macron betrayed & derailed the motto fraternity, liberty & equity.
British born Australian: Wake up UK, abolish the House of Horrors( Lords?), Royalty and all their arse licking hangers on, peers, Sirs, Earls, Viscounts, etc, etc, super expensive Public(?) schools and all organisations that count privilege above merit. Come and join us in the 21st century.
I have always felt sorry for the children born into the monarchy. Their lives are ordered from birth. Money isn’t everything.
This video is not going to be here for a long time I'm afraid.
The only King I’ll bow to is Jesus Christ.  Charles is with the enemy of all mankind.  An enemy of our sovereignty, inalienable rights, constitution, democracy and all things good and decent.  A great shame.  I am now totally anti-monarchy as a result of Charles and his role in the Big Brother global  ‘Crime Oligarchy’.
message from Scotland, King Sausage Fingers can shove his Orbe and Sceptre up his erse....the trouble with the main stream media is they don't allow any alternative view or dissent towards the Saxe Coburg Mafia who call themselves the Royal Family, you can get arrested for just standing and holding up a sign that says " Not My King".....I'd say it was a total joke but it is no laughing matter.
Tampon king and best mates with savile... but he knew nothing! Get rid of the monarchy asap... and wake up the millions of brainwashed sheople licking the royals brown eye
A direct descendent of vlad the impaler.
You've probably covered this before. The Windsors were German and have to find an English name.
Diana knew this.  Chop!   It's probable that Prince Harry knows it too, explaining his flight to the USA with his bit of stuff.  I assert that old Victoria and the late queen mother were two of the most evil . . . unnecessary to elaborate as to why exactly, but think of the vast monopolies created by the Companies Act that strangled competitive trade within all countries that were "liege servants to gracious majesty".  "King" Chuck Saville Schwab Thunberg Windsor can stick his coronation up his pampered royal bum and his slavish myrmidons can do likewise.  I'd as soon swear allegiance to a cow because she gives back for what she receives.
Keep the truth coming my friend.
Brilliant
I totally agree! Waste of money! They arent really english!! The queen german and philip a greek!!
We are being BRIBED BY THE ROYALTY TO ENJOY THE STREET PARTIES.THE POP SINGERS AND MUSIC make it somehow alright for the Royals to be in the limelight yet for all the wrong reasons.
fantastic!
This fella needs to come over too Belfast and speak to the unionists and loyalists community. Or get him on the Stephen Nolan show.  But we know the BBC would never allow it.
Where do they get all those medals,they don't seem to do anything to get them?
perfect
Give a like if he is not your king

Ex 2RRF - Get a f**king grip of yourself pal
The poor RF way are they being treat so wrongly. This is something that happened so many 100s of years ago.
Cant stand this hatefilled bitter vindictive jealous shit anymore its really starting to get on my nerves. Why is it that everything that the UK does is mocked or ridiculed and anyone who shows even an ounce of patriotism and love for this country is told that they cant and they are far right or racist. I and millions of others will gladly welcome our new sovereign in on Saturday if you don't like it then politely shut the F**k up and let the rest of us enjoy the day.
very satisfying to hear a brit talk about their pathetic royal family like this. how fun. but as an american i can't be that cocky given the erosion of our democracy and how we accept even less. still i find it very pathetic that y'all have a king.
Well said, sir! The sooner these useless popinjays and peacocks are gone, the better.
Didn’t the “estate “ get sold to the city of London? Don’t the banks own everything? 🇳🇿NZ
I love this bloke.....we need to take our planet back....and our lives
Oh go play in the traffic,. Your just a jealous commoner.
Refreshing to hear the truth
the more I watch about you is the fact you do not have any facts
Well said my friend. I've been saying this for 40 years. Trouble is not enough are smart enough to listen
why did you join the army then? PS your fingers are grubby. Guess you are earning your money now on your channel , cos you are a capitalist now - grow up boy!
Not exactly balanced
My primary gripe with this family, all part of the eugenics movement, is their affiliation with Schwab and WEF. They don’t actually support us, the people. They are not fulfilling their role.
If I was in the forces  I would not be fighting for this woke BS royal farcery
so brave, how you speak your mind about these "gangsters" white people living in the richest and freeist country in the world think they are brave lool
The Royals are finished. Literally everyone I know can't stand them and what they represent.
I have so much respect for your views someone who speaks the truth of how many of us feel.  Keep it up.
Well said MUCKER.
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
ex Rifles, i totally agree
This handsome man smells like jasmine rice.
The internet has shown just how the royals have regressed to the times of Henry VIII. They are nothing but a family of greedy inbreeds. Australians don't want them down under.
As a 56 year old, I’ve flipped in the last 9 months from proud monarchist to out and out anarchist. Get rid of them and Parliament. Rotten to the core
Outstanding 👏
For society to progress the Establishment must fall.
An angry ex soldier imo  spewing his vengeance Do something worthwhile with your time mate
Just turn the TV off don’t listen to the radio on that day the pedo gets crowned for he is a pedo and he is not a king just as he never had the right to be the prince of wales as that was stolen from the welsh  Never call him king
This royals should be put in theur place, this monarchy is outdated
Don't forget the gangster politicians, bankers, MIC and pharma!
Looking on from outside in Ireland I am far more worried about the UK's elected politicians than King Charles as he may have money but has no real power. Politicians have in my view have decimated the UK since Brexit and unlike in the USA there is no light at the end of the tunnel.
No King of mine . He inherited £440,000,000 and paid no inheritance tax,I'll have to . He had an affair , and now she'll be Queen , God bless Diana , he's just not worthy
It's far more serious than this I'm afraid. Best mate Jimmy was jack the ripper by the looks of it and it gets alot worse
there are millions of people who can't even afford the electricity to watch the debacle on tv.
The problem is that the Royal Family isn't the main cause of all this inequality although they are a good example... I'd say the royals and the royal business have more value in what they give back especially to young people and communities than they take. The fact that there is a prime minister that's god knows how many times richer than the Royal Family is very telling. There are corporations running around not paying tax, billionaires are commonplace who are literally laughing at us plebs. But yeah, ditch the royal family, all it's tradition and all it owns, see where it gets us. Nowhere! We've already divorced ourselves from our European neighbours, might as well go full bore and attack ourselves eh and completely divide us!
If he wasn’t dead Savile would be there, the thought of the Rottweiler as Queen is as deplorable as laughable it’s a circus that should have packed up the ol big tent when the queen died l suggest

Yes it is disgrace that the people of the UK have to pay for a man who has  money as water....It has become a sad country....
Charles is just a figure head for the Luciferi*n elites who include the likes of K. Schwab, B. Gates, G. Soros, the Rothschild's, and the Rockefeller's. They are all of the same bloodline and trace their descent all the way back to the rulers and merchant families of ancient Egypt, Sumeria, Persia, Canaan, and Phoenicia, who openly engaged in pedophilia and the ritual sacrifice of children including their own to their "god" Lucifer in the guise of Ba'al and Moloch. Today we see them trying to take us back to the days of ancient Phoenicia and Canaan with the institutionalised "normalization" of the physical, mental, spiritual, and sexual abuse and sacrifice of children..
★★  Well this was about the Monarchy in general ...  Plus some irrelevant criteria regarding Charles himself .. Like wealth and poverty and modern and new factions etc..  I just thought by the title that this was a video specifying why Charles in particular was dodgy ya know. 👍
Britain's number one problem is its positions.
Great piece, excellently articulated. I however have no faith in the materially driven, social media obsessed, sensitised younger generation. The only way change will come is with the gun or the sword... that's the only way it ever truly manifests!
As a citizen of a republic, rather than a subject of some 'king', I don't have to bow or genuflect to anyone as no one is superior to anyone else.
Love the Monarchy as Head of State and not some 'trumped up, loud, ego-centric, nauseating, elected, media/political type' with agendas left or right spouting off with egocentric nonsense. I would have an eternal vomit fest if that were to happen. KC isn't HMTQ so William who I feel is more like Prince Philip can take over in a few years. We need the 'Don't explain, Don't complain' approach, no endless piffle from a nut job! (aka P. Harry)
One thing we do know. 90% of our economy is us. Roofers, plumbers, sparkles and the rest of us. The trustworthy or you are out of a job. Big Pharma, risky banking, Microsoft and the rest are nothing. We can actually live without Microsoft (virus attractors), Godman Sachs (Rishi Sunaks boss) and others. Prince Charles is one of their stooges. He swears allegiance to them. And a piss small part of our economy. So does Westminster. The industrial political process is 95% corrupt. And think about their self being. As Andrew Bridgen put it. We have the best politicians money can buy. They care not a shite about anyone apart for their good living. I am afraid Westminster is as corrupt as the corrupt EU. And as thick as 2 short planks.
100% in agreement! Keep fighting the power DDN!!
This chump the new Andrew Tate?
I did wonder whether I  would disagree with this point of view......no... seems correct to me... Charles leading member of the WEF..... enough said
The last real royal was the Queen she was more Patriotic than Charles will ever be and certainly not kowtow to muslims and islamic culture like her son. The Royals need to be strong ,Patriotic and be there for the UK subjects not let the country be overrun by illegal invaders and Islam.
As a die hard little r republican, I find no use for royalty but I recognize many Brits hold that institution in high esteem. Your german queen, for all the blubber over her passing ruled over the economic and social  destruction of Great Britain. London is a foreign land on your island flooded with immigrants designed to replace a truly great people. Your german royalty is more concerned with the likes of jimmy saville and the king's uncle. Yes Americans never shut up about their revolution but the U.S. Constitution has shown itself more prophetic in showcasing and holding at bay the tyranny America is under. America is far from perfect but they are armed to the teeth. The tyrants in America and their foreign  masters have doffed their veil for all to see. A large portion of Americans who hold their Constitution above politics. The English gave us the Magna Carta. How has that held up in British law as compared to the Americans and their Constitution? I agree. Its time for your german royalty to retire and actual Britons to rule themselves like men.
well said,
Two words for you. President Johnson.
I don't give a fuck either way. Just happy for the day off
Without the British Empire over the brutally and injustly exploited colonies, the present royal families could not indulge in privileges and indulgences. Time is coming with the sun set. Crime against humanity.
Who needs king in this time of our lives? They ARE real useless eaters  who don't contribute to our world.
France and the United states of America are free countries??? Really??? You have unsuccessfully convinced me as my occupation and family keep frequently in both countries and I remain unconvinced.
Just yes.
They’re not called “The Firm” for nothing.
Robber barons.
So well and cogently said. I understand my own arguments for Republic even better after watching this video.
Interestingly, I learned from an astrologer that the last time we had such an eclipse as we are going to have on Friday and Saturday, Princess Diana was murdered in the car "accident."... Charles' coronation is on Saturday... just interesting...
I am afraid you’re missing point like a Teenage Socialist...... and you’re merely peddling hatred by ad-hominem attacks; worse than BLM or BAME.    Any body who would aspire to become ‘il presidente’ would be a crook or criminal like Killary Clinton, Biden and other mafiosi. Perhaps,  you’d like Blair, the Mass Murderer or Starmer who imprisoned Assange and chased real socialists out of the so-called Labour Party, Truss, Boris, Cameron, Sturgeon, McYousaf - “Too many white faces”, Wishy Washy - ‘richer than the King’.    Be careful what you wish for: the majority of modern politicians are venal scoundrels.
i'll be Remembering Queen Diana's life on Saturday.
KING OF Fools
I'm Scottish, Not my king...
I appreciate your view, I have no problems though with the royal family. Actually, I personally think they are good.
My sentiments exactly!  The monarchy should be abolished, as should be the WEF
Did not expect to see this trending #3 fair play YouTube
You worked for them !
the uk caste system half the land of the UK is owned by just 1000 people in the early days of the kingdom they shared it out amongst their friends whilst making millions destitute
What a load of bollocks
World Economic Forum King. (In case you don't know, the World Economic Forum is not some economic institute, its something off the chart that put forward the Great Reset, had a meeting early on in the Pandemic about the positive opportunities of the pandemic for changing the world, and says things like "You will own nothing and you will be happy".)
Agree with every word. They are totally out of touch with people. To look at them realistically -  paedo Andrew in the family, weird and unhealthy looking princesess, Harry run away, Diana is sadly killed/dead princess that people truly loved. Charles is not a nice man, the little queen mother was most unemotional b**** ever
Born in the wrong country
The fact that he is one of the main supporters of the WEF is more than enough to show how he actually loathes the citizens of Britain. The whole family living their fairytale lives and the citizens are paying for it.
if the pope has to give up his gold seat and royalties dont ...well there's ur holiness and religion....Prince gautam Buddha gave up all his royal riches and installed DHARMA without war and weapons  but by teachings and example....like thats ever going to happen again!
I don't like or trust Charles!
Monaechy centuries old institution, reorganised with Charles the 11, HOW has Charles and the Queen manipulated their power. ???
Bob Mortimer should be King, or at least Paul Whitehouse, or Graham Norton somebody like that,.somebody that people actually like, not this bunch of wunts....Long Live King Bob.
Much truth in what you say, but with the Establishment in this Kingdom of Four Nations, you will find it hard to get your message over in the Modern Times, little is known that Cromwell was in Fact Welsh and a Welsh speaker, he became a despot, but for that time which was worse. We ended up with William of Orange and later the Hanovarian bunch of Inbred idiots, followed by Queen Victoria more German than British who would whilst sitting in her Carriage going to Scotland have the curtains drawn so that she could not see the Poor as she went by.  Then the German lot we have now, for me as a Cymro it gets to my gut, that we have a German Prince of Wales, I have no time for any of them.   I would not wish a revolution, but I am sure not in my time certainly because I am much too old, we will become a Republic maybe a three nation Republics, Alban, Lloegr, Cymru, with NI part of a joint Iwerddon as it should be.   I served too I can tell you many many Years ago.   Prynhawn da. Pob Hwyl and Good Luck.
The irish have been saying  that for 800 years ...
Great video. The old lie that the Royals bring in money through tourism is just that. Go to Vienna and you will see the Habsburg palaces crowded with tourists.. you don't need a royal family that takes billions of tax money without anyone being able to question it.
“The King” sounds so ridiculous when used in Charles
Love to you and yours ❤️thank you 👏🏻you have no idea how many stand with you ,and know it’s all just control ,power,money .
The cost of this coronation is truly bonkers....It's like one of those presidential celebrations that pauperised various African nations.
Sinking ship ✋
A few facts,   We tried running the country without a monarch from 1653 for 5 years and it didn't go well at all - ask the Irish, Scottish and North England :-/.  The job of the crown has been marketing the country since 1689 (the end of the glorious revolution).  Commercial retail companies spend up to 20% of their sales turnover on marketing.  Using this rule,  we should be investing the lion's share of £2.45 trillion/yr X 0.2 =  £490 billion/yr on the royals.  We actually invest around £85 million on the Royals (including maintenance of their residences, which double as tourist attractions).  The £billions of foreign investment alone that they've helped secure more than justifies the £85 million/yr expenditure from a profit and loss perspective.
All the kings horses and all the kings men couldnt put england together again were screwed  bY treachery from all sides  shit mp s now a muslim loving king
I'm a Royalist and proud to be so !!
Fuck I'm Australian, the monarchy is the biggest meanest joke pulled on people. As an ex soldier myself I am not below anyone. Especially not thief's and inbreeds.
this guy is spot on they will let us be surfs but if you stand up to them the gansters come for you.
i love your references to the Civil War - you are spot on in that the initial few years after the King was captured until the aftermath of the Putney Debates are the most socially radical ones this country has known. You are also spot on about how the Monarchy is the foundation of entrenched elite priviledge. If we accept the Monarchy must go then the next thing is a written constitution and parliamentary reform. Them Up There don't want that so they'll happily tolerate the monarchy to keep that day away.
Might cheat down here, not come judgement day.
Ok ,I watched this but didn't notice any exposing
My mum always gave me medals when i was a lad
My dad said they were the biggest welfare bums in  the world.
They are a joke but due to the class system they will always be in power as thats why we have it
And keeping their heroine poppy fields going in Afghanistan.
Well said your a ⭐⭐⭐ a waste of public money 💰
There can never be true and real democracy whilst there is a Monarchy.
I don’t think I’ve ever come across a train driver at the food bank, sorry.
You lost me when you claimed doctors earn a pittance. Ridiculous.
You forgot to mention the The Diggers, who might I add were even more radical then The Levers & if were around today, would rightly be called Anarchists!
I have no idea about military service of Charles but his two sons apparently did real time, William as a search and rescue pilot in the RAF in England, and Harry in Afghanistan.   Not everyone is born at the right time to serve in war.   Both of my sons served between the two gulf wars.   Apparently Elizabeth greenlit for William to go to Afghanistan but the RAF chose to not send him.   I would see search and rescue off the coasts of Britain as a fairly dangerous posting.
What a puff! Has this guy been taking estrogen? Imagine coming out of the army this left wing and traitorous, complaining about authoritarianism etc.
Amen!
Keeping the young people informed is the most vital power we have. I've said it all my life, the Monarchy are nothing but top-tier gangsters.
I find it hard to believe that the Monarchy is to continue as it is.
All countries have a head of state, you are simply badly confused
As expected, there's a lot of citing of _stuff_ - but very little actual argumentation. Of course, the 'stuff' is loaded with presuppositions; however, one) they're not necessarily valid, and two) they're not necessarily shared.
The huge difference between Charles & the Queen is she was deeply invested in being a servant to this country where as Charlies he just a king but I prefer him than whats after him.
I’d like to know who are the people behind the nazi monarchy
Very true - and very funny!
Become a republic? Two words:  President Blair
Lionising the French? Dude, France is a high tax ghettoised hellhole…. The Royals are human baubles, nothing more.  As you say, they help trade.  Sure, they represent the class system at its top, but without them we lose a huge chunk of social fabric.
Hopefully the nz media will continue to ignore the upcoming coronation and our country will become an  independent republic  soon.
Charles is a globalist in bed with WEF
The Duchy Of Cornwall is nothing but a money-making scheme as are most other titles the royal family have.
No king of the working British people. He's a *_W·E·F_* shill & their sponsored poster boy.
It's the queen that was the biggest scum.
Absolutely nails it! Spot on
👏👏👏👏
I don’t think that they bring more money than they take .
💯% Fella, I’m an ex Aussie Para who got sworn in and had to pledge my allegiance to the Queen, during that time I had no idea about the Windsors and their history of being a Tyrannical dynasty that ruthlessly dispatched people who had titles and land (precious resources) they wanted.. The inbreeding 🤢🤮
Hope something happens that forces him to abdicate before he is crowned
So not only is this clown a traitor, he's also a massive hypocrite, when he was in the British Army he would have made an oath to Charles's mother Queen Elizabeth II, "I swear by almighty God that I will be faithful, and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs and successors, and that I will as in duty bound, honestly and faithfully defend Her Majesty, her heirs and successors in person, crown and dignity, against all enemies, and will observe and obey all orders of Her Majesty, her heirs and successors and the generals and officers set over me." So he has already sworn an oath of "true allegiance" to King Charles III as the Queens heir and successor. I hope someone will round him up and send him off to the Tower of London.
Our politicians are worse.
Not my King .!
The way the queen held on to the crown until her dying breath should be a giant red flag for us all. Charles isn't remotely qualified for the job, and the queen knew this only too well.
He's too old
Excellently put.. couldn’t agree more..
Great video
Amen to this
Another elite parasite, I have no respect for this close friend of Jimmy Savile.....Not my king ,
Over privileged twits the lot of them.
Not to mention that they all share the same ideology as Jimmy Savile
"Biggest gangsters in the world" You make them sound cool.
There should be an inset photograph of the King-to-be in the dictionary next to the definition of the word "hypocrite".
Why did you swear allegiance to the  Queen ? Was it because that was the only way you could get to shoot people. You two faced git.
💢 *-WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM-* 💢
Long overdue , thanks
Did you serve as a GUARDIAN in the Royal household, only you know so much.😊
Down with the crown
*No king of the working British people. He's a WEF shill & sponsored puppet.*
Im an ex Grenadier Guard and am a Republican.
All the royal families of Europe should have been exterminated after WW1.  They were at least as responsible for the deaths of millions as anyone else (e.g. the church, the arms merchants, big business, etc.).   Look up Saxe-Coburg-Gotha if you want to see just how dishonorable a family can be.
Spot on. Down with these crooks
I think if you got rid of the monarchy and just had a government there will always be people out there who will wish to gain power and privilege as we witnessed in communism, its human nature to gain power and privilege over their fellow humans - the rest is just ideology as I see it which hasn’t worked when tried and will never work imo.
The royals are nothing but a tourist attraction in the UK. They serve absolutely no purpose to anyone else or any other country but to cost other countries money.
There are so many errors in this 'chip-on-shoulder' barrack-room rant, starting with the click-bait title (he "exposes" nothing by the way: its all opinion) that it is difficult to know where to start, but some of the ones I remember: 1. The Royal Family do pay tax (the sovereign since the Windsor Castle fire, 1992) 2. The French republican model cited here, actually costs more than the Royal Family to the public purse:  - French Presidential Office cost £101million (€105m) in 2021  - UK Sovereign fund £86million in 2020–21 (a third covering state-owned property maintenance) 3. Most of the Royal Family's 'wealth' is state owned capital - they cannot sell it for their own benefit.  The choice is not Constitutional Monarchy ("loadsamoney") vs Presidential Republic (zero cost), but very similar cost while only substituting a globally recognized and distinctive British institution for a politician as head of state. Thoughtful people do not want another politician as HoS.
How very immature
I like a monarchy (I'm dutch) and I find it difficult to listen to criticism. I have however concluded that we can have the monarchy but not one that has a lot of assets. Strip the assets!
King Charles the Turd
Royals are German(Hanovarians) - Queen Victoria could not speak English up to 3 years old.
If the monarch were still the Queen, you wouldn't say this negativity about the monarchy.  Besides, the Royal Family and the history of the monarchy make Britain, Britain. It is who we are. It's our 1000+ year history. Without that, we'd be nobody. Yes our past has ups and downs but the monarchy has served us well. That's the nature of history. Deal with it. If we were a Republic, would you lot want President Sunak? Probably not.  Also, our system is a constitutional monarchy, which has worked for 1000 years. This means that the monarch is an essential component in how laws are validated. The monarch signs the parliament bill and makes it an act of Parliament. He/she commands the military, and other national services.  The monarchy IS the constitution. Take him/her away and you have to start again.  It doesn't help that schools don't teach the importance of the monarchy in schools.  On a positive note, after Charles, it's William. I think he'll be brilliant; better than Charles. We just have to endure Charles for a while.
#PurgeThePosh
Two besties were pedophiles of the worst order, totally destroyed Diana with the help of his bit on the side .....look up to him as king ...i think not. Not in my name
Yes.  To everything you discussed.  The RF is no more "royal" than anyone else on the planet and seeing photos of Charles throwing his first garden party (while the peons try to make ends meet) makes me want to vomit
We should become a republic
well done, Joe, Thanks for posting an honest and pertinent debate regarding the Biggest Thieves and Mafia EVER!! we need to disinfect  our lives from these Satanic entities, for good, 🙂
Oh loved that piece of history you spoke of....
Don't forget the laws that apply to us, but don't apply to the monarch. Some don't apply to others within the royal family. If you go back far enough you'll find the monarchy began because one gang killed more people than anybody else, and took over. That leader then bought loyalty by handing out land and priviliges to a bunch of cronies who became barons. Skip to the present day, and you still have a monarch, while the barons have become the aristocracy. The monarchy and aristocracy still own massive amounts of land, all of which was originally stolen. We only need a referendum and an act of parliament to abolish the monarchy, but with a country full of hypnotised sheep, that's unlikely to happen. I've read recently that the younger generation are either completely uninterested in a monarchy, or actively want it gone. Because of this, I predict they will very soon be targeted in schools and social media with a "love your monarchy" campaign, complete with the lies and disinformation required to get them onboard.
Thank you for truth....
74 years old and never worked in his entire life...if that s not a privilege and abuse ..tell me what it is.
so give us some service history WALT
Wow…You know how to call it…Truth you speak will win out some day…
Whilst the Royal Family does have vast wealth, I don’t think it’s fair to blame them for the polarisation of the UK. This is the result of government policy. If we were all a bit richer we wouldn’t be so hateful of wealthy families.
Kamloops the school in Canada
I am a royalist. Everyone can have their own opinion but please be kind. No need to be nasty. If you don’t like the Royal family so be it. Who cares what you think.
❤king Charles 🤴
never forget king charles was also best mates with record breaking pedophile jimmy saville
Another part of our culture going down the drain, Sad.
I will not be celebrating that man how evil he is  can t stand him, that's why the queen says never explain and never complain. So she looks good but the reason for her motto, is she has not got to answer questions. Clever don't you think.
At least Charles is not a Plantagenet.
How many people want a German king?
Tell them to get a proper job ? what is your job mate making stupid vids ?
These videos are excellent and so informative. Let’s hope and work towards changing this backward country into the green and pleasant land promised to us, the people.
I do believe that the video chats an amount of BS and is so ignorant of British history.  So what if the monarchy are a bunch of elitist and so decadent as a society of classed people.  They couldn't look after the Queen's two cousins in-house but shun them to a care home.  Go look at the politicians before and after Brexit, go look at your local MPs performance, what they drive etc.  Since when did they deserve to drive those expensive cars? Then stories of offshore investments and talk of the reason they left the EU was to keep their tax havens Safe.  Forget the illegal immigrants, the country gets more than before when we were in the EU.  SNP husband arrested for accounting fraud, Labour anti-Semitism blah blah.  If the House of Commons is supposed to be a representation of the people then why is it newspaper media or subject to some commons investigation, just because an MP dragged a dancer across the floor on strictly come dancing?  The House Of Commons is also full of would be criminals that can hide their dirty washing well.  You want a republic and I want a government establishment where they're truly representing the people and not these bumbling individuals that care about their career in politics and not doing their job and representing their constituency.  Sniping coloured tape and opening places, kissing babies, then when they want your votes, they tell you what you want to hear.  The monarchy, House of Lords, House of Commons is full of people that have learned to keep their position and don't represent the people or are the people's taskmasters.  What is worse?, a monarchy that finances itself and knows a few gangsters? American politicians have no problem knowing them just as much.  Our own politicians sacrifices Healthcare and sell it off to American companies whilst they allocate money to build warships.  You remember that when there was massive defence cuts, the NHS got a boost in cash.  Trump builds a golf course in Scotland and turfs out the Scots living there.  But you want a republic.  If we get a republic, we'll just get more tosser politicians that can get up to no good either on camera or behind the scenes.
Chubby little fingers???
Dont follow leaders, watch the parking meters!!!(Dylan) Steal a little your a thief, steal a lot your a royal.
Monarchies aren't great, but Private Monopolist Parasitic Banksters, are the worst.
Millions of people in Britain lives on food banks.  Says it all.
Monarchy, Elites, politicians all of the humans we could do without.   Make the world a much better place for the rest of us to live in.
This guy is very basic in his understanding
Excellent presentation, you hit the nail on the head very well. Let’s move forward and get rid of this Mafia once and for all.
Well, needless to say, Big Ears is not my king. Not just because I'm Scottish, but simply due to what all that royal nonsense is about.   You've summed it up nicely but forgot one important detail. One that the hypocrite Charles would like buried and buried very deeply, his very close association with numerous paed o philes. Andy seemed to be keeping that family tradition alive, you know, following Mountbatten, etc.
Yupp time for TOMMY ROBINHOOD and his Merry Men Shut the MAFIA like carteL Down for EVER!
Charles HAS committed TREASON by his blatant and open aiding and abetting the WEF agenda which seeks to subvert and abolish personal and national sovereignty
Why should they get a council house?I cant.
Not my king. Clown king
Hi there, as a ex squaddie, who realised that the military was a business in 1990 when i exited the reme. The walls down... Babies out of incubators in Kuwait... Boom. And behind it all Lizzy...Queen of Babylon. But all roads lead to Rome.. Cheers xlolx #NotMyKing. 😂
I don't think Queen Elizabeth the second did many arms deals with Saudi Princes.
The youngsters think there are 100 genders and a fully bearded man can identity as a woman, with a p*nis. I wouldn’t put any faith in them electing a head of state, with sense, who can actually govern
Great short and important speech.
Charles is part of the globalist elites and they are communist to the core; watch as Charles reigns over the UK as it brings in a Chinese style social credit system, in lockstep with all the other western nations, around 2025. Much as I loathe the monarchy, I fear you are pushing the proletariat end of the communist equation.
Sir. I certainly agree wirh you. Theyre certainly gangsters.  They helped Adolf Hitler in ww2.. Adolf Hitler attended one of  the fake queens childs wedding.. Photo is in colour ... He has no moustache..  At end ww2 many Nazis were saved. Many Nazis were droppes of  In Ukraine.. Nazis rule Ukraine...  Adolf Hitler went to Argentina... Supposedly Adolf. Died in 1995 ????!!!!!!!  Sir... Keep speaking TRUTH.AMEN. THANK YOU.AME
I shall spend the day in bed sleeping off night shift ready to do another shift Saturday night.  Along with roughly 3 million other people who work nights.
In my opinion Charles should not be the person to carrying the authority for this position. Elizabeth probably do not have any options to give this legacy to him. I understand that the UK are very excited for this momentum but nevertheless its happening. Maybe the UK people are afraid to comment on it.
The only pledging I’ll be doing is with a duster!
We'll said 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Too rich to get rid of
Not just them, Bankers, Multi Nationals, The whole Govt National and local...all Need their Mussolini moment swinging on a lamp post.
This is what i do not understand, the expense of the coronation (250 million in total) 150 million for security, then the rest of the country struggling!! i cannot understand it. Millions of children living in poverty and squalid conditions. How many council houses could we build with this coronation expense!!
Their only claim to the throne and wealth is by having ancestors who were better at killing and stealing than someone else's.
The crown estate takes 3 billion pounds from Wales every year and we are left with nothing Wales is the poorest country in Europe and England is the richest how can that be fair this is why we need independence from this government and go our own way
As a former British Soldier you swore an oath of allegiance to HM Queen Elizabeth 11.and her heirs, did you not?  You are a scoundrel!
Couldn't give a shit about any of them. This 'public holiday' on Monday is a scam, I was forced to take a day of my annual holiday as our business has been forced to shut. I'd rather work it.
Bang on, we need to start taking what we need from profiteering multinationals and taking back what was stolen from us...
I find it disgusting when you see them dirty roayls in military uniforms embroiled with loads of medals. Down with the monarcy
No, I don’t think we should have an elected head of state. The role should be allotted like jury service, so that anyone can be called to open a hospital, cut ribbons, look at the trooping of the colour and meet other heads of state.   And it should most definitely not be a political role. It should be a mundane bit of voluntary service.
This guy would happily if it were possible be a prison camp guard if it meant he could personally eradicate anyone who he deemed better off than himself.
Do u really want the likes of Sturgeon as head of Scot republic
Charles keeps interesting company
Lets not forget Charles knighted Jimmy Saville the nonse case and was his mate along with Andrew who got cuaght nonsing.....Hes not my King, never will be.
And this King will sell us out
and they end up with communist makron
He is not a good man. I do not care a out his sex life. I do care that he was given the ability to marry Camilla, as nothing more, EVER than the Queen Consort. She was NOT to be made queen ... but, now, she is. He has rewritten the Bible which does not need to be rewritten .... to fit his Globalist Woke agenda.  He has damned Britain with that one act.  Do as he says, not as he does.
France is a republic and Versailles still brings loads of tourism...
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Very proud to have a former soldier admit to the corruption. The whole lie of fighting for queen and country is a moto well placed into naïve squaddies! Now we just have to get the simple minded civilian to see reality no matter how much reality hurts their bubble!
wow 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Two Words: Oliver Cromwell
If they bring in so much money to the country Why are we the people so skint and struggling again and again ! 🤬
My cousin went through training in the raf with William and as soon as William finished do whatever he was do they made my cousin and all the rest redundant
Let’s not forget they love people who get convicted for things that you tube won’t even let you mention.
The history of the UK is far more interesting than the version taught to us in school. If you really look into the reality of what being British is really about it’s not about Kings and Queens it’s about the grit of your so called ordinary people.
You need to have a word with Paz 49. That brown stuff on the tip of his nose isn't just a spot of left- over camo cream.
Watch legendary Dennis Skinner MP he had a few suggestions as well as getting kicked out of parliament on a number of ocassions and also Spitting image!
Not a fan of Charles. Unfortunately almost everything this man says shows how little he understands the constitution of the UK.
Abolish monarchy abolish Commonwealth realms abolish communists Charles iii abolish royal family communists
Nice one cant agree more.
Treason without good reason
Genius. Best thing I’ve ever heard about this bullshit institution.
time to get rid
Totally agree m8 😂😂😮😮
King Charles the Turd!
Royalty Died when the Queen passed…their are no more Royals
We're all the same aren't we ?  Arrived here the same way and we all shi t and pis s .
This is one big confidence trick.
Be like the French!? Slap yourself sir! Don't want the monarchy or to be like Europeans, especially the French!!!!
Even if the twat lives to 100 years old, we will only have 25 years out of the cnt. 100 million for 25 years. Then, yup, we got to pay up for the next inbred pillock and it'll probably cost 10 times as much. Taken for mugs yet again.
ed web 7 hours ago Your partly right--unfortunately for the English they are the second tier crooks--they are just the leaders of the landed gentry--the aristocracy--the real crooks--the real gangsters are the bankers led by baron Jacob Rothschild. Ed
"The Royal family are just cosplayers" thats fucking golden mate 😅
I'm not a royalist, but I think you're wrong. UK has no true power, soft power is our only strength
Never worship any mortal man only god
As acid in the colonies, I had to pledge allegiance to the queen each school day for many years.  By the 70s we had finally moved on from colonial dominion to country status and the royalist nonsense stopped. To this day though at least one bill has the queen or now king on it as a symbol of our loyalty.  I have long ceased to think or care about the British monarchy and can only say that I I wish we could divest ourselves of these parasites as easily as Barbados did recently. Alas, history has made this very difficult for us, but I live in hope.
They’ve all got double standards
There is no place for these so called royals in modern England in the year 2023
I completely agree with you....times are hard for the peasants but we will spend hundreds of millions on the coronation,what a joke.
80LL0CK$ to old sausage fingers.
Their bloodline comes from Germany, they are Nazi’s.run them out of town now.
Used to be the new monarch did the pledging! What's Charles afraid of that he needs this? What's he planning?
I have to confess as an ex serviceman that I would have given my life for the monarchy, until 3 years ago. Then CV happened, I woke up and went down the rabbit hole, and now I want to see them swinging by the neck
France has more foreign visitors than Britain despite having "done away" with their royals.
The real king of England lives in Australia
Well said
He could be the Antichrist, Don’t be deceived by him. Don’t take his mark. Turn to God and never perish.
Queen Elizabeth ll was AWAYS aware how tenuous the monarchy reign really was but her children have never really  understood that reality.   Government is a contract with the people.  Those in power will ALWAYS distract the masses from the truth.  But ultimately someone will come along and turn the masses on the monarchy and government.
I agree with your view, and learned a lot from this, thanks
The Royals are evil just like the pope they’re going down brother they’re going down
As an anti royalist I couldn't give a stuff about royalty and the royal family and the monarchy is outdated and has no place in our wonderful multicultural country that our corrupt governments have so kindly forced upon Britain's native people. People must be mad for supporting the monarchy in todays not so much British country when the monarchy is supposed to be about Britishness, isn't it.
What the he'll the king got exposed but the queen didn't
Thankfully, Charles will be last of this farcical institution.  They may not be perfect, but the French, the Germans, the Russians, the Chinese, the Austrians, the Greeks, the Italians have the right idea.  To add insult to injury the Royal Family isn't even British.  What does Saxe-Cobourg und Gotha sound to you?  And if you really want to be technical about it, the surname of Charles' father is Schleswig-Holstein Sonderburg-Glucksburg which he changed to Battenberg.
Perfect but plz break it down more slowly.😊
Those Royals are most foul and most vile.  💁🌹🙅👍💯⭐
Sorry mate I too am ex British Miltary and think Charles is a waste of space but the Tic Tok nurses the teachers pushing an Alphabet agenda on our children and over paid doctor's and train drivers are every bit as despicable as the Royal Family
Have been a Royalist all my life UNTIL I  learned of Charles and the WEF!   Over and out!
I love hearing people step up and tell the truth! Good man! May God Bless you!!!!
The delinquent elitist hegemony, which currently runs this country; sustains itself by *DEFRAUDING* the working class with tax promises, and then *PIMPING THEM OUT* for personal/fraternal advantage! The elitist mob definitely needs to be *BROKEN UP* and forced into the light; and the systems of Governance should take account of; and be robust enough to handle; the perfidious self-serving slime who circle in those elitist fraternities, who claim to be personally responsible for the hard work of others; and obfuscate any situation which might cause them to be effectively challenged!  We need to break up their divide and rule *SCAMS!* Were the immigrants to blame? Were the unemployed to blame? Were the disabled to to blame? *NO IT WAS THE BLOODY CONSERVATIVE PARTY, ALL ALONG!*  We need to identify and study their historical *FRAUDS* in depth. Knowledge is strength. There should be University Departments researching it.  And the Monarchy sit at the centre of those elitist and exclusive fraternities. They *MUST NOT* simply be disbanded/ended/cast out. *THEY MUST BE FORCED INTO THE LIGHT, ON OUR TERMS..!!* They abide by *OUR RULES* or have outlived both their questionable role in society; and the claims they make on our lives.  And yes, there is such a thing as *SOCIETY!* And I don't remember pledging my life to anyone or anything whatsoever, before I was born in this green and pleasant land! They cloak themselves in nationalistic tropes; but it was *GOD* who made this green and pleasant land (if anyone) *NOT THE ROYAL FAMILY..!!* They say it themselves every time they sing their hymns!  lol.
The idea of monarchy is quite sick in this day and age.
Isn’t for King attending the meeting in September on how to speed up the one world order and one world economy. How do the British people like that?
I'm Irish and live in England and love the English. But I have never understood the monarchy and why its celebrated, it completely baffles me.
A referendum on the EU, a vote for Scottish independence but Charles is untouchable. This should not be the case. Britain has changed the Royal family has not and that is a problem. Feel sorry for Charles a bit but he and his family have not done themselves any favours. Aristocracy has no place in the modern world. The fact they will sell their souls for money like Prince Harry is sickening. Time for change!
Lol, Hater. Turn your attention to yourself, no one asked to be born, including the Royals.  You do love the sound of your own voice, just an observation. 😅
Just get rid of the royal family let’s be run by government they all doing a shit job
The Royal systems= The humanity enslaved system. Wake up people.
Friend : Move to the States instead of being   BUTENBERG ' s subject .
Angry little bloke. Obviously seething with anger. Chip on shoulder. Watch your 6.
His second son is the worst example of everything you're saying. So dead inside.
Long live King Charles
Prince Philip didn't refer to the Monarchy as the "FIRM" for nothing!  That is exactly what it is!
What a breath of fresh air, to hear an honest assassination of the corrupt criminals who think they preside over us.
I believe any monarchy is a waste of taxpayers money, I was born in Portugal, and we did away with our useless Monarchy, and never looked back. King Big Ears is a member of the WEF, and this is not good for the Country or even the world.  People in Britain are starving and this Pompous Old Man is using Taxpayers money for this Fancy Party.
Stolen Valor
Oh, there’s Cumberbatch being honoured by being raised with wealth that came from African slavery that benefits his family to this day.
I salute you ✊
The Royal family and everything they stand for is absolutely repulsive.
#AbolishTheMonarchy
Where are the artists?  Frankie Boyle.  Look up his Farewell to The Monarchy program. He absolutely skewers them.  “A slightly dim German family to whom we have inexplicably decided to give billions of pounds”
No revolutions were peoples revolutions, They were all caused by a small group who used the poor masses to overthrow the rich minority so the small group could then steal the wealth. The poor majority never became any wealthier.
Broken Britain. Vote for something other than the three main political parties if you want change. If enough agree change will come.
Put them in a migrant hotel for a week.
The British royal family has German roots and changed their name from Saxe-Coburg to more British Windsor in Victoria’s time. Also why does the US and France not have a monarchy but a president and a republic?
I love that you're referring to actual historical events and people but we need to keep in mimd the fallout, pain and widespread insanity that came with them. Your image of the French is ridiculous, adorable but ridiculous.  I've studied cultures throughout history and the various styles of government and you know what, nothing worked for very long, the longest lasting democracy only made it to 2 years before WE THE PEOPLE wanted more from eachother, demanding, immature and ignorant people who were always part of the problem not the solution. I'm always open to suggestions but my answer's the same as everyone elses right now "I've got nothing" 😐 We're a 1st world country absorbed in our own self importance moaning like children over something because we csn't think of a better way, from what I've seen that's insulting children 😒
The Royals cost uk tax payers more than they bring into the country.
We were taught about Cromwell etc in school during the 80’s so don’t know why you weren’t.
Im ok with Charles. If he limits his family in service
Oh, you are a communist.
£100 million for the coronation did you say? People struggle to make ends did you say? And how far would that £100 million go, it's less than £1.50 for every one of the 68 million population of the UK? Compare that pittance  to our gangster elected government, during the Covid fiasco they borrowed more than £350 billion and turned the UK into a prison camp for what was for most people a mild virus..  The £350 billion works out at more than £5000 per person. We still have that debt now. Now tell me, what would help citizens the most, stop the coronation and give everybody £1.50 or the £5000 per person the government squandered during the covid?
Wakey Wakey people i totally agree with everything this guy said i will not be watching or celebrating the coronation and the was old lug ears shooed that pen away was disgusting behavior time is right now to abolish the monarchy and make Buckingham palace in to a museum!! I cant stand the entire family the fact the they were friendly with pedophile does it for me and then u have SRA i wonder how many childrens bodies are buried on their land!!
This guy is ROASTING the royals for breakfast 😂😂
The personal  knowledge gained about this institution is vast. One cannot write here for obvious reasons. I recommend others research like I have and become self Empowered for doing so.
Ti like this guy hes always on point
"Charles where did you get all your medals from?' ,   'My mum gave them to me"
No mention of his master Rothschlld tho I see 🤔
I'd rather pledge allegiance to Charles III and the Prince of Wales than to some jumped-up little tabloid gobshite who writes crap for The Guardian while pretending to be working class.... _daaaahlings_
So, will you be watching the coronation then?
Inbred sex offenders,Never have been nor ever will be my royalty. We have NO need for these monsters
Charles the last can kiss my arse, I've got a £30 axe from B&Q.
Excellent video!!!!
100 Million for Charlies coronation paid for by the Plebs. 8 Million to bury old Queenie paid for by the Plebs. 12 Million iirc to keep Andrew from facing a Day in Court in the US for his little Girl fetish paid for by the Plebs. 150 Million a few Years earlier so Queenie could decorate Her Palaces again paid for by the Plebs. Medieval relics ain't cheap you know......
And gilded honour shamefully misplaced.
So good to hear an English man speak the truth about these selfish people ... Hypocrites   too ... English people deserve better ...
As always a brilliant view. Vive la revolution
How can he reign when he can't move his own ink-well.
Not me if he's crowned he's committing treason no stone of destiny and because he's in with WEF he's behind everything
😂😂😂😂 silly silly man, keep dreaming about a republic.Whether you like it or not monarchies are the ways many many societies have chosen to organise there societies.The center of society must exist and be removed from the masses.They are the gate keepers of the traditions of that society. Look at america, within 2 generations you have a nation who have no idea who they are. This is the fate of the republic, clueless and no sense of identity. Because there are no national rituals at the center. The wealth that you complin about is the wealth of the nation, held in trust by the windsors ,they and the establishment maintain order that we all need in our lives.
Born and raised in England , I love the Royal family if you have one person in charge what a nightmare it is happening all over the world the head of state is there for one thing .
As a fellow x sevicseman NOT MY KING.
Thank you for this.   Excellent, and the one writing this so agrees. We have the same situation here in the U.S.   Most don't know it.   All presidents also descendants from bloodlines.   Texas salutes you.
Biggest family on WELFARE BENEFITS. Don't need to pay TAX.  GREED & EGOS kills humanity.
Hey! I'm 66 and ex Navy and trust me I will not be celebrating! Biggest con around self self self is Charles way.
Well said. I feel like I've got Hobson's choice this weekend - either have the coronation pushed down my throat or suffer the absolute pain of Eurovision 😢
It's  jason Statham   this guy  is the bollocks   kool well said     mate  @@  Bravo !!
Instructed by G‑d, Samuel warned the people in great detail about the dangers of appointing a king. He cautioned them, as it were, that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, which means that kings are liable to carry out abuses of power. He predicted that they would come to regret their request, but the people were adamant:
Jimmy Savile.... Fullstop
Im ex military ex Submariner and I totally agree with everything you say - sometimes I feel like an island when we see it just pleased others see it too and I do advocate history repeating itself The Charles Kingship have already had one beheaded he is the head of the snake  just saying  thanks for your expression as it mirrors my own -
100% THIS!
If the younger generation get to elect a head of state, God help us. It’ll be a transexual, disabled minority 🤣
The rulers, aristcrats and royals are feeding of the more or less poor working class wich now account for 70% of Europeans. Why shall we pay for this group of anti democratic  elitists.
What's all his medals for chasing corgis around their estates?
Can we also blame the suck up media for their wall to wall royal frenzy nonsense
Absoluteky spot on. Especially the dress up part. Bunch of fake soldiers and nothing but criminal.
And this guy is NOT feeling suicidal....
Maybe that or the fact that there is a lot of passive opposition to the Monarchy and it really is dying on its feet.. I get the feeling it was 75%respect from the late Queen and maybe 30% for the rest combined..Andrew did irreparable damage that lingers around in the same way Diana does. The cost of living crisis just highlights the fact Britain can’t really afford this kind on unnecessary costs at this time..
Nobody travels to England just to get a glimpse of a so called royal. I’m almost guaranteeing the ones that show up are paid actors.
Charles and Camilla are both Philanderers and should not be King and Queen, all this fuss made about them both, is sickening
Insane anyone who pledges allegiance to charles. He hasn't earned the right of king. He needs to denounce wef and net zero. And stand for his people if not i won't call or see him as king.
cue up Alexei Sayle's song from Stuff: "Proper job." edit: @1:03
Well, if you don't like King and the Royal family and what our history stands for, then it is time to leave these shores and go and live in a Republic and worship a President!
And he deffo DIDN'T kill Diana.
Shame on uk solder. Iam not British, but Britain is very unique country and especially    Royalty. I highly respected Queen Elizabeth, her faith, her lifestyle, her self control, her dedication for her country, tolerance and endurance. And I stand for young royals William and Kate.
A total waste of money imho .. that could be used to alleviate the starvation and death of the millions of people that are living with it. It's an abomination to humanity.
To all the people who think we should keep the monarchy because they bring in tourists, bear this in mind;  the world's most popular tourist destination is..........France.
Fair dues to this guy he woke up in time . I wonder if he thinks Charley give the order for his 2paras régiment to massacre the civil rights marchers and thus turn the civil rights Pacific movement into a violent struggle that could be used as an excuse and be suppressed by use of extreme military occupation martial laws and illegal crown support for paramilitary extremist terrorist groups? Dublin Monaghan Bombings etc all criminal acts will Charley ever be convicted?
Not my king
Whilst agreeing with every anti- royal sentiment you state. Does your military background not recall Iraq, say we abolish the monarchy, without an in place strategy, we could well end up with a power vacuum, which leaves open to all sorts of insurgent chancery  president Simon Cowell, with Katie Price as culture secretary, anyone ! Just be careful  what you wish for, just saying.
Whether it be a king, Queen, Prime Minister or President. It seems corruption & greed will always drive those who seek to get to the top 🤔
Fat fingers that have never worked.
I Tend To Lean towards these "royal" Creatures as Lizard People; No Human Compassion, No Feelings For People Suffering, in Agony, etc.. My Cousin, Who is English and Lives in the North of Country say Everyone in Britain is a Monarchist! Even if they don't admit it they are lying!  This Sounded so ridiculous I had no words and just moved on. Those Entities need to be put before a firing squad and all Stolen Treasures Repatriated to place of origin.
THE NATION monachists SUFFER FROM STOCKHOLM SYNDROME
Parasites all of them.
Well said 👍🏾
Charlie sides with WEF; he is a national traitor
Why are you all shocked he’s allied with the WEF the always have been this family along with a few others control everything and everyone these people couldn’t give a fuck about anything or anyone other money and control , find out the real history about these and then you’ll be woke
They own Regent street and all the big brand outlets: Crown estates: check it out:
The Royals not paying Tax is the only thung they've  got Right, Taxatiin is Theft
Not from the UK but have a question..are they not from the house of Hanover which is German?
🔥🔥🔥
Yes! Thank you! At last, a video I agree with. This whole coronation is a ridiculous farce. The royal family are the biggest universal credit cheats in the whole of the country. Leeches. Andrew's a pervert, Charles is an entitled idiot along with all the spoilt spawns they have. and it goes on. I hope charles will prove that they've had their time and it's now over. Instead of Charles's coronation, GIVE NURSES A PAY RISE!
Thank you. When you trace back the lineage of any so called royal family, they began like anyone else; except they just happened to have been the winner of a physical scrimmage for land and power.
Before accusing the RF of bad behavior, just clean up your own rooms everybody, work your whole life by duty and service for others than yourself, give others hope and respect, believe in God, serve and be humble...and not gready and jealous, he french you show are hidious sinful ones...sustainable examples are only found in decent and hard working royals
It's interesting when he talks about artists becoming more elitist/complacent/complicit. He lingers on the Sex Pistols as a positive example,  but John Lydon was a huge fan of Donald Trump. I wish he would have taken this avenue a little further to include how the rebels of yesteryear have been bought by the powers that be.
What film was that footage from?
Charles is also a WEF puppet, the worst of all. The Monarchy is evil.
It was that "super-socialist" Tony Blair who did all the dodgy deals with the queen, exempting this bunch of freeloaders taxes such as inheritance tax. I find it obscene that Charlie, with all his vast wealth, has expected struggling taxpayers to pay for his beano. Of course, the peasants will lap it up, but their numbers are dwindling. Thank the Lord....
Correction 250 million of tax payers money and the public will have to kneel and pledge allegiance for their trouble. We don't want a elected head of state scenario if its anything like the long line of gangster American presidents.
The way he treated the staff of the palace makes you realise he is not human.
So we know now , why the Tories started the food banks 12 years ago. They knew the state of future inflation. And refuse to help the workers earn a living.
He sounds like he's talking about his ex-wife.  Very bitter, and a bit jealous.
All the tv news channels are saying how much the king is loved!!!  RUBBISH HE IS NOT LOVED AT ALL

You sir are a credit to your country, both a a former soldier and as a decent upstanding citizen.  What a lovely way to spend a few minutes, listening to you set out your well reasoned arguments for the abolition of the monarchy👏👏👏
they don't own all that land and when there gone it ours  its owned by the crown
At Last, someone is saying what so many are thinking...this man is mad in the head and I will say no matter who he thinks he is he is not my king and never will be...I WILL NOT swear allegiance to King Charles now or ever,..never he is a weak-minded fool
100% Argee!
Apply yourself and you can make a lot of and you can make a lot of money in this country
Its not just Britain its the whole world. These annunaki descendants of the fallen angels have positioned their clan in every country. Ruling reptilian elites come in all cultures,. religion and colours. Its a worldwide takeover positioning their pieces on the chessboard of the world and summoning in a new world order under Lucifer their wannabe fallen angel demigod.
You swore an oath and that demonstrates your word
Not my thing.
God saved the Queen a few times before he realised he was being mugged like the rest of us🫡
Well said!
All you say is true, a bunch of theives and murderers, but alas it will always be true that those in power will abuse it, they will have the best and keep us down. Outing the Czar made way for another bunch of murdering bastards under the guise of solcialism. The French got shot of the monarchy with bloody revolution and then Napoleon was crowned emperor and took France into a series of wars. So what ya gonna do? I am not in any way prejudiced, I hate all power mad nut cases equally
and the biggest podophiles
Wow how did you get this far on ‘YouTube’. But i heard they own nothing and are owned by the bank, also are not legally allowed to enter the square mile.
It's going to be kick off week end of royalty last stand .
" Marketing wing for various arms firms!" Spot on. My faith in "Plant Whisperer" Charles evaporated when I saw him attending a an arms fair touting killer weapons to the Suadis. Pft!   PS Love the sex pistols but even Mr Lydon became a establishment mouthpeice.
Are you awake yet people!, if not,  you deserve what’s coming, outside of mainstream media there’s enough evidence to wake you up 1000 times, open your eyes!,
When I heard on the news that the queen was dying I went to work at my shift, 2-10pm, and arrived there with a smile on my face. I was asked why I was so happy, 'the queen's dying' I replied, and I had to explain why she wasn't just a wonderful little old lady. It took a while but a few people came around when I said that that woman never had to dress herself, never did any ironing, never did any washing up, never cooked a meal, didn't even raise her own children and thought the world smelled of paint.  People must also understand that the Crown Estates own land all over the commonwealth, the price of independance for countries of Britains former empire. The british royals are probably the wealthiest family outside the Rothschilds. It has never even crossed my mind to join the military, I am a child of the 60's, peace and love was the mantra then and it still is for me. The Secret People is a great poem by G K Chesterton, I ask you all to read it.
Viva la England Revolution now.
A criminal cabal runs the world and Britain.
See Bibi Buuchas  . The Monarch still financially own the USA and commonwealth countries   If we pay them their incomes so as to attract tourists , would you not think that there are cheaper ways to bring in tourists  ? This is phenomenally expensive for us to pay  . Doesn't make sense.
Who do the ROYALS bring in money to?? I mean whom benefits most from TOURISM ??? Multi national companies who hire poor immigrants and pay them NOTHING almost. Who benefits from tourism?? not the british people you need to build houses not hotels!
Trouble is people are handing their lives over all the other crime families in politics and big business..
German National Anthem: “Unity, Justice and Freedom!” UK National Anthem: “no.”
I have nothing, literally nothing to give to a man who has someone who irons his shoe laces for him, and another who orders a servant to climb 5 flights of stairs to close the curtains when that man is sat right beside those curtains, I have nothing
Still deserves respect, He IS our King.
You can criticise your political system without insulting other nations.
This gentleman has a lot of his info wrong. Royal family do pay taxes. They are not the ones that take Ur money and land- that's the government!! Most of them do work hard- no -one more so than Queen Elizabeth, who was definitely a good model to all, and brought much more tourist money than the Monarchy costs us.
The low -brainers with Comments and loyal to the King Charles Regina the third 🤴
We serve neither King nor  Kaiser.  Up the Republic .
amazing truths
First time viewing your channel sir, i must say, a truthful assessment of the cretinous anachronism that is our constitutional monarchy. As an ex regular myself, may i suggest an addendum to your almost perfect critique of the rancid Charles...He is also MALTHUSIAN ideologue, an advocate for the eradication of 7.5 billion 'useless eaters"  Charles and his peers subscribe to a murderous, Satanic orthodoxy! May his reign be short and monumentally painful for the malevolent British establishment.
What a load of whingeing!! You're only feeding hate  ,socialist claptrap...get over yourselves.
Replace the 'gangster' Windsor family with yet more 'gangster' politicians? Better the devil you know I say.
Crap hat😂
I have a few rules that i never break, one of ems that i never bend the knee to sick elitist pedophiles and their families!  Strip em of their wealth and redistribute to every English man, woman and child in the country!
Keep up the good work. The general population need to wake up to this moronic royal drivel!! 😡
You have summed up perfectly why we need a republic, get rid of the royal leeches and there hangers on
The royals are defunct -- Charles is a globalist in bed with the evil WEF, the perverse greedy, tyrannical robber barons of our day, a criminal syndicate (do your research, prove me wrong)
Ditch him now, Charles us unfit to reign, his own sister has already said it.
100%... every word.  👏👏👏
Levellers? Never heard of them...proving the point.
I myself will NOT be celebrating on Saturday, don't like him never have, I don't think you can have a woke saying what he thinks should happen, his mother our beautiful late Queen was neutral and so should he, BUT he's poked his nose in to thing before the Queen died and I think he will when he is crowned King, maybe not outright but I think he will privately in the back ground. In other words, he can't be trusted.
Don't make fun of his fingers. It is disgusting what you are saying! One day, when you are 74, your fingers might look like this. Never know what illness you are going to have. You can make a statement without making fun.
Interesting article, I too have recinded my Oath, talking of his sausage fingers,  not a well man methinks, physically, we know his mental health is suspect..hmmmmm
Bang on.
Someone should restart the new model army. That would be an army worth joining. The current 'system' that currently in place in this country is clearly broken & needs to be dismantled ASAP & replaced with a fair system where everyone is treated as an equal, not as plebs who have no rights. Charlie is only a king of fools.
Sounds to me my friend that you might welcome the return of the ghost of Oliver Cromwell like me? Whether it/s Monarchy or Parliament, neither inspires me sufficiently to swear an oath of allegiance. Very sad, is it not?
I used to think we had it bad in Canada until I remembered “ The Royals”,even Trudeau doesn’t have a gold coach, yet.
Thank you. Finally a conversation I've wanted. Charlie is the antichrist. Research.
Every day is poppy day Lest we forget Means do not forget, Shame the ex soldier forgot ,  information of tax non payment is false just check the records. As you signed your allegiance to the monarchy years ago , a stint in the tower may help you remember   This guy is a gobshyte who spoke mouth fart from the beginning.  Please get a life, i think he will remove the comment as the maker of the film will not like the truth , as most people don't   Next he will be making extremist videos like Donald CHUMP   Be well people   Every day is poppy day
All of the charity BS. They never donate, but they do get their portion of laundered money. Just give out another OBE and give someone dual citizenship and maybe have Parliament change the laws. Charles may as well be Humpty Dumpty right now.
Biggest gangsters of them all. 100% this man speaks the truth.
Like the archetypal trickster, these charlatans have been masquerading as nobility and rewriting history as to fit their lies and deception. The trickster is often a character who represents disruption, mischief and humour. Think of Charles with his bad jokes and remember how saville was also a joker and oddly enough best friends with old Charlie. The trickster is also portrayed as cunning, witty, and unpredictable and rule breakers.... History repeats itself because we live in a world of distorted light, and the absolute truth never sees the light of day. What you believe history to be, isn't. It's been manufactured for at least several thousand years to favour those who wish to rule over you.
You are correct about the massive swathes of this country the the Royals own. It is a disgrace that the 'people' do not have access to our own land. They probably don't even use it. GREED, GREED, GREED..........
What a crock.ur discrace
I don't understand why people imagine that monarchs should be good, kind, democratic, liberal, moral, and upstanding.  When was a monarch any of these things?  Even the "best" ones were horrendous. Countries that have monarchies do not support monarchy for those reasons.  The problem is not the monarchy but the people who support that institution.  Monarchs would be nothing and nobody without their eager audience.  Monarchy is not your problem.  The monarch-mindset is.
Mad you explain your self as a veteran. You were a melt. Broff bell
The sun hasnt rise n when i would swear allegiance to ANYONE.  I SWEAR ALLEGIANCE TO MY GOD ONLY !!!
P A R A S I T E
Charlie is the antichrist... research
You only have to look at his best friends, Jimmy Savile comes to mind. How many pedophiles have been given knighthoods. I rest my case
We need a written constitution so badly.
Who's taking the piss out of power? The Sleaford Mods.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loiI8M3U7gA
Not a friend of England
I am not a royalist , I'm not going to watch it because I cannot be bothered to sit in front of the tv for hours with endless pointless commentary , I never do . I will never forgive them for what happened to Diana , and Camilla is not my queen . What the British solder says , is up to him , I've not listened .
So let me get this clear. Are you a monarchist or not ?
Charles was unfaithful to his wife, and now he parades around the world with his mistress.    I just don't get why Brits support him!
The monarchy are in the illuminati.....Charles is all for the great reset and zero carbon earth. He believes in all faiths..so is his constitutional statement going to be ..For the faith, as in Christian, or for faiths...
As a former soldier myself I completely agree…. And if I knew then what I know now after what I learned on service….. I would never have joined….. I met him a few times and had a conversation with him….. that was because I wouldn’t let him into the camp because he would not go to the bag in his boot to get his ID….. I won’t go into what he said to me but he was exactly as I expected…..!  Not a king …. Just a predator…..! Charlie is still counting the cash he received from those billions of dollars that Obama sent to Iran, there were I think three planes that carried that cash and one of those aircraft flew to Brussels…. The cash was split between a number of politicians in the EU but the largest share went to Charlie boy…..! 😡 It was so blatant even the Daily Mail reported it admittedly only in a small way… Anyone who knows about Denver International Airport knows that the British monarchy owns great swaths of land around the airport…… not just as a landowner but as Sovereign Land…! In the USA!?! Though they are one of the largest owners of land in the USA but the monarch owns more land on earth than any other individual or family…..! I was an ardent monarchist but my experiences in life and in the mob proved to me that even the worst things you hear about them are true….! Never my king….. the only thing this predator deserves is a wall….!!! 🇬🇧
I think queen Elizabeth should have been it. We have a cost of living crisis. Many people cant afford essentials. Yet we can shell out for a coronation and a royal family. Its a complete waste of resources to prop up such a parasitic family
I dont think most people know that the Royal Family call themselves the Firm... Mafia is right... also there is little to No difference between the Monarchal System and Fascism, Communism, Socialism and Oligarchy even Crony Capitalism.... behind all of these systems is the Most Evil Organization Ever, an Organization that is allowed to print money out of thin air, making the ordinary people (us, so called common folk all over the World) Pay for Their Lavish Lifestyles.. Why did the Queen make a Royal Charter/Mandate banning All Members of Parliament from asking questions about the ownership of the Bank of England back in 1970/71 ? Our Government says the BOE is Owned by the Government (We the People),,, do we, you really believe that ? Why should the Governor of the BOE earn 3 Xs more than the Prime Minister who holds the highest Public Office/Position in the Country if the Governor of the Bank is also a Public Servant... come to think of it there are many Civil Servants earning more than the PM,,,, how is this ?????? ....... So Corrupt and the Wokeness that has taken roots in our society has all been planned to keep people Divided just like this Cost of Living Crisis and High Inflation the Elites are Not Content on just Stealing our Money, they Now Want the Lot including your Soul... They want to Control Every Aspect of Your Life ...... There Can Never be Peace and Harmony in this World under the Corrupt, Privately Owned Central Banking System... They who Control the Worlds Money and Payment Systems Control virtually Everything.....  Until we take down this Evil Organization and get Honest Money we can never again have Democracy and Honest Governments that Work for the Benefit of the People and the Country...
Okaaayyy, then, Joey 'right-on, wanna be Rotten'; when you became a British soldier you took an oath to the Queen and her heirs. This just makes you look like a shitty little traitor pushing a clever, so-called republican agenda. But then it's not about King Charles now, or the terrible history of the British monarchy, and how they f**ked over the poor British people, is it? It's all about YOU, innit sonny?
The ultimate racism.  The public has an inferiority complex
Which elected alternative type of head of state is he advocating? The French system , where the last President was convicted twice for corruption in office? Or perhaps the US system, where the last President tried to mount an internal coup to stay in power? Or perhaps the Russian system, where the "elected"  incumbent  for the last quarter of a century recently invaded a neighbouring country intent on political, linguistic and cultural genocide? Oh, and didn't all three have revolutions this numpty recalls fondly? And didn't the failure of the Levellers end up ushering in the only military dictatorship this country has ever had? Or perhaps our "former soldier" thinks we need a new "Lord Protector"?
I really appreciate the detailed overview. Thank you
Well Done Man! hats off to You!
Sadly, you do not understand.   The royal family are just caged birds that you show off to earn lots and lots of money at very little cost to the nation.  I would be very against any of my children marrying into the royal family for what is really a shit life.  Would you do it, I know I wouldn't.
I think I might have been happier if this had been said by someone who wasn’t an army deserter. That fact alone weakens the entire argument. You say you had more in common with the Afghans you were fighting. Presumably, Afghanistan is where you are living now?
They are German Greeks.   We could use the monarchy as a statement to show the immigrabts who have been imported here since 1947, all illegally, that repatraitiom is going to happen.  Send them back to Germany in the clothes they stand up in.  Lets be a republic once more. We deserve it.
It’s all Ermine trimmed bollocks.
The whole world's a stage everything is made up,everyone's playing a part in the joke
The liddle widdle, skiddle and diddle white supremacy power structure wascals vs great humanity. Travesty the calamity, sliding inexorably toward 8th generation warfare : great humanity, invicted.
If I ever meet you, I will pay for the drinks, all night. Spot on.
God didn't save the queen either. Jolly good rubbish removal.
The whole thing is bloody ridiculous. British people are suffering from mass Stockholm syndrome. Who can wave a flag at these people and then queue at the food bank? They are ghastly. The sooner they're gone, the better.
Royal, parasites!!!!!
I'll never pledge my allegiance to Charles in any capacity. Why would I when I don't give a shit about him about the coronation or about his family. I mean I didn't even pledge my allegiance to the queen when she was alive so why would I to her son who isn't all people think he is???
I choose Charles over this fake
Charles was planning Diana's death by car crash!!!
I find it amazing that we can let these leaches have multiple residents that they only use a couple of times a year when we have thousands of homeless, we also have to pay for the staff that service the residents year in year out ,I can't think of any other country stupid enough to finance this rabble.
Remember what happened when, in the 1950s the British government was locking Kenyans in concentration camps and the Queen did nothing about it?
I think Charles had princess Diana bumped off. If she was pregnant by a arab man then the royal family couldn't have a arab child in line to the throne.
As a former  British  soldier  for 28 years  myself, I totally agree with  you..I certainly  won't be  watching this crap...100million for the sheep  to follow  these clowns... There is no inheritance tax for them to pay. Charlie Boy has a fortune  of 1.8 billion when people  in this country are  struggling  to live... Not for me...
This coronation isn't going to be the big deal everyone thinks it is,I know of no one who is remotely interested in it.
, (Insert full name), do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King Charles, his heirs and successors, according to law. So help me God. You said that. Was going to say more but you are not worth it.
This is the same guy who was refused by the police , he is treasonable.
Monarchy pillage ,start wars, Other nefarious agendas. WEF, Land theft, deaths,  Secret Societies etc. More need to speak out about corruption.  Thank you for truths. 🙏
How embarrassing, look at all those fake medals.
This king must fall and it is up to the british people to do it. It is above comprehension how this incredible wealthy people with all their fantastic uniforms with all their wonderfull  medals which they do not deserve can come out and think the people will believe all that shit.
Elizabeth was the last King!
Outstanding video, apart from the fact you mentioned one of my all time favourite bands 'New Model Army' you failed to point out the 'Windsors' have only used this name since 1917 as after the second world war using their real GERMAN family name was not going to very popular with the population of the British Isles. I will agree they are gangsters when you realise where they came from, one of the reasons why, when serving in the British Military i refused to ever send any of them any correspondance as i could not, would not, finish any letter to the royal family with the words ' i have the honour to be your obedient servant'...... NAH i think not.
Declining all invitations to celebrate the coronation as I will be far too busy cleaning my toilet!
You do NOT HAVE TO PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE IT IS VOLUNTARY!!!! YOU WOULD PREFER THE BULLIES WHO WILL RIDE ROUGHSHOD OVER EVERYONE ELSE'S OPINIONS  JUST LIKE OUR GOVERNMENT S AND  THOSE  WHO HEAD UP """SO CALLED ""GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE ALL THE WHILE  TREATING MOST IF US AS SOMETHING NASTY ON THEIR SHOE ,THEN TELLING US TO ECONOMISE BETTER ,NO DOCTORS ,NO HOSPITAL APPOINTMENTS ,EXCESS FUEL  PAYMENTS  WHILE   THEY SIT BACK WITH  EXPENSE ACCOUNTS, DEDUCTIONS  FOR  HOMES ,CLAIMING FOR HEATING , TRAVELLING EXPENSES  AND PAYING THEMSELVES HUGE WAGES PLUS BONUSES !!!AND YOUR WORRIED ABOUT  CHARLES ???UT IS THE GOVERNMENT THAT NEEDS TAKING TO TASK  FIRST  THEN SORT OUT THE REST !!!!WE  ARE LOSING THE RIGHT OF A """"""CHRISTIAN """""COUNTRY  BECAUSE OF RACISM AGAINST OUR OWN  UK PEOPLE !!!AND YOU SIT THERE ALL  FAITH  AND  VOWS  NOW FORGOTTEN  AND THINK IT IS RIGHT !!!! JUMP ON SOMEONE ELSE'S BANDWAGON AND DO SOME GOOD INSTEAD OF CAUSING EVEN MORE  UNREST IN THE COUNTRY 🤐
Well said the crown is fading away they ain't even English there Germany biggest gangsters in England robbers of land and of the people's money no shame
I'm surprised jewtube allowed this, but remember it's the Jews paying this shill in jewtube.. strange times.
Tiny pay rise ? 😂 is this clown serious ? They were asking for a 30% increase ! What about 99.9% of the rest of the population ? You think they are not effected by inflation ?  Come on son, no fan of the royals myself but at least talk the truth !
Royals have butchered and robbed their way through history! They’re the scum of the earth!
Charles should have been given a choice before becoming King: a) to be the Constitutional Monarch or b) to be the head of the Church Of England or as he prefers the church of ALL FAITHS. Either or, but not both!! Hardly a patriot in the way the old Kings and Queens were when they lead from the front.
This stuff is news to me. Never had anything personal against Charles particularly because hate politicians more. But it does normalise tax dodging and massive wealth.... Not good.
The #GreatLeveller is coming at #QuantumSpeed and when it hits it will not be - #GoodGrief, Putin just dropped missiles on #Ukraine or, #OhDear, the generals in Sudan are fighting over natural resources...  The next time your smartphone sounds #AnAlert - it may be #WorldWarThree and a #ThermoNuclearExchange that will literally send everything #2HellInAPanCart and #GuessWhoWillBePushing???  #StayTuned
Well said mate.
I seem to remember that 'Spitting Image' sent them to live on the Fifteenth floor of Urine Tower!
Like the queen the king may only be king for 3 days and recalled as the chair to the crown , they also may sign purposely on the wrong end of the page
Unfortunatley they will still turn out in their millions waving their little flags.
PEDOS
if you threw the royals out of that palace, you coud rent the hundreds of rooms at a thousand pounds a night to the yanks and chinese with lots of money. this would be far more profitable.
I wouldn’t piss on the 🔔end if he was on fire 🔥
We are not going for it
Brilliant. We really need this.
I refuse to swear allegiance with this reptile or his family , respect to,you sir for being honest , a real Brit !
Totally agree with the narrator. This pretty much sums up the UK. Enjoy. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jz5jUMVfJP4
What film was the clips from (not the Monty python clips) please.
You just exposed the stupidity of yourself.
They are all finished the true is coming
What a breath of fresh air. I've been saying this for years
He was patriotic enough to join the military, which requires swearing an oath of allegiance to the Monarch, but he’s a republican?  Are you sure you were in the Armed Forces?
Nice work if you can get it, they make me  fucking sick
"The House of Windsor"  is an abstraction ! Originally their name was  "the House of Hannover" , but ,  it didn't sound english enough , so they changed the name !!! And I agree with You on all points !   Greetings from Denmark !
how do they get all the medals? they have not been in any wars if they have it's in the background
They are spending £100m on this, while people are campaigning for donations to Erskine Hospital. Theses men and women swore an oath to the monarch - and she (now he) and their representatives in the government abandon them.
thank you for this video. You man of inspiration and truth, that exposes our society.
How disgusting can you get, wiping his dripping snotty nose on his white glove and then expecting the serfs to shake his snotty gloved hand .Sick
Brilliant courageous summary.  Depose these foul ticks, expropriate ALL their holdings, and punish them with mandatory public service.
Its  hilarious,  Charles  would make a court jester better than a king. 3:16
Soldier isnt telling you. MONARCHY IS ALREADY GONE. Search Queen opening any parliament Wales Scotland England. Since 2017 >>>>> she disnt wear CROWN OR GOWN. Trump walked infront of her.....  She didnt get crowned on Real STONE OF SCONE.  This soldier has probably had to detail Andrew and had to watch him $hagg a k1d and do N0TH1NG
FTK!!!
I am a ROYALIST  just because you do not believe in ROYALTY DO NOT TRY AND  GET OTHERS  TO SEE YOUR BIAS !!!!!  YOU  THINK  THAT WITHOUT  THE MONARCHY. THIS COUNTRY WOULD BE BETTER ????? DO NOT KID YOURSELF YOU ARE AS BAD AS HENRY !!!! WHY NOW  ???? WHEN EVERYTHING IS IN TURMOIL  you have to stir MORE !!!HOW IS THAT SUPPOSED TO HELP ANY NATION TO SORT OUT THEIR PROBLEMS ?????
Nice one!
This guy speaks facts
My Dad was a seventeen year old lad when he fought in world world rwo, he was here now he would call you a traitor
About Charles, the first thing that comes to mind, that you never mentioned in the whole video is his affiliation with the WEF Great Reset. That is pretty significant in my book. You will be a serf and be happy!
What a nasty man you are. You find just the right time to make your accusations.  I shake hands with and thank every soldier who served in our armed forces as I respect and admire them and I have never met one I saw differently since you opened your mouth to just do damage at his Coronation. I would rather fight my battles alone than have you standing nearby and I am 75 years old. You make me sick to my stomach. It is envy that keeps your mouth moving and nothing more. Shame on you.
Does anyone have an Idea how many royal titles their could be if the law was changed in the USA?    In the United States, the Constitution prohibits the granting of titles of nobility by the federal and state governments. This means that any attempt to change the law to allow for royal titles would require a constitutional amendment.  However, if such a change were to occur, there are many possible royal titles that could be created. Some options include:  King/Queen: The most obvious royal title would be that of King or Queen. This title has been used throughout history in many different cultures and could easily be adapted for use in the United States.  Duke/Duchess: A Duke or Duchess is a noble title that is typically given to a member of the royal family who is not in direct line for the throne. This could be a good option for members of the extended royal family.  Prince/Princess: The title of Prince or Princess is typically given to the children of a monarch. In the United States, this title could be given to the children of the President or other high-ranking government officials.  Earl/Countess: The title of Earl or Countess is a noble title that is below that of Duke but above that of Viscount. This could be a good option for members of the royal family who are not in direct line for the throne.  Baron/Baroness: The title of Baron or Baroness is a noble title that is below that of Earl. This title could be given to members of the royal family or to individuals who have made significant contributions to society.  Viscount/Viscountess: The title of Viscount or Viscountess is a noble title that is below that of Earl but above that of Baron. This title could be given to members of the royal family or to individuals who have made significant contributions to society.  It's important to note that any change to the law regarding the granting of royal titles would be a significant departure from the current political and social structure in the United States, and it's unclear whether such a change would be widely accepted or welcomed by the American public.
I rather watch my turds come out than spend time helping that WEF weasel
Buggered if I'm going to pledge my allegiance.  Especially to a bloody  TV ! Get a grip KC ! Maybe to your Mother , and WILLIAM
Monarchy is a hangover from Empire. Out of date and time for it to go. Great video 👍
Very well said 🎉
We tried to be a republic didn't do it don't need a president thank you just move to Russia
Young people were not the most egalitarian when it came to Lockdown's, masks, V-pass etc. Some students pushed down a fence at their university that was a makeshift Prison in 2020, that's about it. Hardly anti-establishment.
The British royal family? Wasn’t their surname Saxe-Coburg-Gotha before George changed the name to Windsor  Isn’t Saxe-Coburg-Gotha a German sounding name …..  mmm 🤔
Well said I totally agree
Why do all the men soldiers signup to defend the crown and country ? You can’t believe how many people work to protect the Royals , soldiers , Royals and blues and police  This line killed to be Royal stealing the crown from Richard 3 , paid to bribe his allies against him and it is still happening today killers that use brute force to get there own way and have power over the masses to control them all paid off by money  I honour God first , Charles can’t even defend the true faith of Jesus Christ trying to honour and please all people and faiths to get what he wants . This used to be a Christian Country The British empire used brute force to kill and steal all from other countries I wonder if they karma will come round ?
The point is that the so called King of Our Country will secretly every year (like his mother before him) goto The City Of London and kneel (take the knee) to the head of a certain Rothschild banking family. So when you find out why that happens, then you are closer to realising the total mockery of our Elites. They are indeed gangsters and pretty evil despicable ones too and they will try to keep us all in surfdom and slvery for as long as they exist.
Absolutely on board. Royals are nothing more than mobsters who take over and "legitimize" the family. Same the world over.
By looking at his hands, it doesn't look like Charles has long to live. If he is the man that Nostradamus wrote about he will be driven into exile. Nostradamus also gave quatrains that included Diana and (Freddy) Mercury by name. Nostradamus said the King would loose the soul twice, he did, in divorce and then in Diana's passing. His affair with Camilla has divided the nation. I like the fact that the monarchy have held much land that the government couldn't sell off to property developers. If there was no monarchy successive governments would cover the UK with concrete.
Has Charles ever read the words of Jesus
As a veteran when you joined your regiment why didn't you refuse to swear to the queen
Absolutely agree with you
I can't imagine the monarchy being abolished too many people like them... I think
Superb, extremely articulately presented. Good on you mate. DDN brought me here. I wanted to hear more and ordered your book on “Amaz-img”.
spot on and jug ears is a epeaser of other faiths , a disgrace having these thugs run our country
How nasty. You have your opinion but stop talking ru bish. Ho a d live in a Republic and then come back and critise.
a very quick math lesson here ... 1 million pounds is enough for average folk to live for 30 years.  100 million is enough for 3000 years or 100 people to live comfortably for 30 years ... They will spend it all in one week ...
I can’t disagree with one bit of this.  The nonconformist artists have never left, we’ve just been forced out of positions of power, like always.  I’m an artist, was a professor until I quit in disgust.  I’m also American, of course, it’s a shitshow.
You mr commentator have the makings of a tyrant yourself. Its the politicians who have ruined the country. The fall of the monarchy will leave you with absolutely nothing in GB. Except for chaos and muslim rule in 2, 3 decades.
Great appraisal.
Thankyou for this brilliant video, Im 77 my Dad was an anti Monarchist,so am I.
What the hell is going to happen in the World behind all of our backs, when every one is distracted by the coronation.
Superb content! Not my king.
Even Charley Manson was impressed. It's the reenactment that gets me. Manson used to reenact Jesus  to his followers when high, but Manson wasn't high. Tampon is no roll model. It's got to be the biggest  gaslighting experiment in history.
Oh dear how sad   never mind
I think more and more people are in agreement with you on this, But take heart, this civilization is in decline and when it goes down the shitter, the Royal family will be no more.
But the thing is they have no power, charlie is a mear figurehead taking a pittance compared to what a president (i assume that's what you'd replace them with) would take - imagine this country run by the tories _and_ a Trump
No forelock tugging for me. Sickening parasites and weirdos the lot of 'em.🤮
Are you suggesting we get rid of Charles and instill a left wing gender grifter offended by reality?
F the king
Articulated perfectly 👏👏👏
Lock me in the tower if you want Charley boy, but your still a knob,
Check out the Glasgow Celtic supporters,they let people know how they feel about the monarchy.
Would this clown prefer a president??? maybe Boris Johnson. Typical London lout.
The bastard and his slaves have already fallen
Protection of the crooked style mafia right wing libertarian Media in this country what needs billionaire Mongols running Britain for the selves
100 million. Rude boy can go in his living room in his pj's and sling that thing on his head and call it a day. Slagmilla can record it on her iPhone and job done. Pay the key workers and stop all this extra crap. Regal wasters
The tabloid press has made it too risky for celebrities and politicians to speak out against them.  That’s what makes H&M an exception and they are being made a harsh example
Better hope the bill the passed in Ireland , doesn't come here
He's German " not even English. ..
It's a club and we're not in it!!!
Not my king
I certainly  won't  pledge alliance  to Charles not a cats chance  a woke king who has alegences  to the WEF they have lived of the backs of the tax payer long enough
I agree 100%
👏🏿👏🏾👏🏽👏🏼👏🏻👏 🖤🤎🩶💜🩵💙💚💛🧡🩷❤️
A WEF puppet. With him as King things will only get worse for the common person
Well, I’m from America I don’t care if you have a King or you don’t, but I can tell you one thing I would never Pledge of Allegiance to anyone except God😊
Spot on
You are one of the most protected so called workers who just mooch off the rest of us and complain.
From the USA, I have no respect for a king who divorced a beautiful princess to marry Cinderella's ugly sister.
What a bitter and twisted statement, what were you thinking when you joined up, I suppose it took years of taking the Queens shilling that turned you
Owned by the City of London. Lock Stock and Barrel. The monarchy operate solely on behalf of the City of London.
Well I do not give my allegiance - as far as I'm aware he should be giving his allegiance to the people.
Thank you , for your thoughts. You are right, but, there are many who still worship this mafia family, unfortunately.
Country is broke, people in poverty,  struggle to survive, while these people live and thrive in luxury; definitely people love to allegiances to them....Good for everyone....God save us!!!
Someone on radio today summed it up for me ...I do not wish to watch an old billionaire sit on a seat.and the fact they will not reveal how much of our money is being spent...unbelievable.
here in France we have a machine for this type of situation. For rent if you need it, affordable price.
Thank You Mr Former British Soldier! Your energy, delivery is powerful. I looked at 8:18 ... frozen in time and space... an image of a Dying Queen with Her Dying Son ... a  ideology that is 'Death Itself' ... finally !!! succumbing to it's own sacrificial sanctity. 🎶 Oohhoh Haappy Day✌️ Much Gratitude DDN❤️🇺🇸🤭
As a disabled persons this makes me sick.I'm pushed through so many hoops for my entitlement and can't afford to live. They have to go, absolutely disgusting people playing soldier. Inbred animals
We need a Democratic Republic.
Well said 👏👏👏👏
Completely right and I’m so relieved it’s not just me thinking this.
Great speech....i think you are damn right...we here in the country once called  Deutschland have also so much to offer but most germans seems to not know anymore...
What makes me support the Monarchy is the alternative.The quality of most of our politicians is dire, I hate to imagine who we'd get as head of state.Wouldn't it be just as bad?
The German lord Windsors
Charles swore his allegiance to the WEF, not the people of Britain. He ain't no king of Britain. We need another Cromwell
👏👏👏
Yeah! where the fuck is the revolution!
I am all for removing the royal family...BUT! Be careful as that power and all the assets have to transfer somewhere.  To the people perhaps? Lets be real...that wont happen. It can be done (see scandi countries) but can also go wrong (see the ruskis)
Abolish the parasitic monarchy
IS RIGHT!
God save the king you all need to just let it go 😂
Have you seen the French lately ??!! Look just same as we are country in same awful situation going down hill fast
I hate them and everything they stand for. We have people starving and people struggling to make ends meet and this Coronation BS is in very very poor taste. Such extravagance when so many are having a hard time. They need to be abolished.
The king and the royal society are descended from psychopaths and act like the same now  Psychopaths are the root cause of most big problems in the world Propelled by greed and no care for others They wear a mask of sanity no one can detect so we accept them as regular people when they are happy to see us die
Didn't adolph hitler demand personal alliegence to himself in the good olde days of nazi germany? We all know how that little thing turned out. I liked the olde queen in her younger days but the after dianna especially, i gradually changed my mind, starting to bone up on "royal" history not a very good track record.  And charlie, phew, god help us all. Ric, ontario canada where we have our own crowned king who believes that he already has our personal oath to him by divine right.  I don't like violence but there are days when i think that perhaps the french had a fairly good idea back in the good olde carefree days of the revolution.
It's a distraction, an illusion, a way in which the rich control the poor! The poor are made to feel that if they are anti-monarchy they are unpatriotic! I am proud to be British but totally opposed to the monarchy!
Where is the constitution written for the monarchy?
I don't know why, but my gut says Chsrles will sell this country down the river. I also feel William could be worse.....i used to love the Monarchy. However, now the Queen has gone. I pray every day to God to help Charles not mess it up.
I agree with you completely .
Small business is the back bone of this country. Big corporations don't pay tax
The only king & queen they're for are the Evils, haters, bully & the racist, Global Queen Meghan Markle & King Harry are the Global leader
This seems... mean... With that said, the wrong man is about to be coronated. It is supposed to be me...
Bit cheeky to sling mud at the Queen in a video titled 'exposes King Charles', she kept the nation well in favour of monarchy with Yougov showing even 45% support from 18-35-year olds in 2020. Let's keep it specific: Charles has never been very popular, Camilla less so, Harry's anathema to most people and Andrew should be in prison. It's the current lot that will nobble the monarchy, with the possible exception of William (although he's a gravy-train riding lazy bones who chillaxes at Ken Palace and did half the public appearances of his grandmother pre-covid). One more major scandal and it's referendum time.
Bring down the crown!!!
Hate the monarchy
Geez...Are you suggesting there's something wrong with King Charles head when he claims he'd like to be Camilla's Tampons?!
Well, we could get rid of the monarchy.  Must be done democratically though.
Charles doesn't even put his own toothpaste on his toothbrush, if he thinks I'm swearing allegiance to him think again. He's a wef globalist elite. Its been said in the book by Tom Cohen that he's also the antichrist!
It's because people are intrinsically stupid.
I work at a care home and have been asked to work to do a coronation party at work... if I wasn't so skint I would refuse to do it but I need the money which is ironic. Gotta pretend all day I don't hate his guts.
Just out of interest - what was your regiment?
Can you imagine “ sausage fingers “ in front of his army during the medieval wars ?  No I can’t ! Coronation? I’d rather watch paint dry !
Edward 8th was implemental of the death of thousands of British soldiers and civilians , but was never tried after the war
Cant pledge allegiance to a free mason
Buckingham Palace annual visitors: ~550,000 Palace of Versailles annual visitors: ~10,000,000  Seems to me as if the monarchy is actively _limiting_ the tourism industry, so it would make financial sense to -guillotine them on national TV- peacefully convert Britain into a republic.
I am all for the monarchy being disbanded sadly Oliver Cromwell didn’t do the job right
Wish I could give ten thousand thumbs up. Cheers mate.
A Monarchy and or any Corporate government is for the collectives who need and external governance of mind. Social media does the same. Yes, all for show, thieves and pirates. Besides, they are all illegitimate, even the Ex queen Liz. William was fathered by Ex King Carlos of Spain, Charlie has 5 illigitimate children and isn't a king anyway. You'll see them all fall.
Well said Sir
Anyone who gets high up in the Establishment knows the Royals refer to their "Syndicate" as the "Firm".  The "Firm" being the Whitehall Permanent Secretaries, "Met Police", Judiciary, Security Services (MI5, MI6, SAS).  They can destroy anyone who gets in their way, by fitting them up or snuffing them out.  Charles adorns himself with medals, yet has never been near a war zone - an utter narcissist.  ALL Royal  wealth stems from taxation and theft.  From when the Norman's seized the land of the Indigenous British peasants to today.  Those of meagre wealth suffer inheritance tax, whereas the syndicate of the wealthiest elite protect their family wealth in offshore secret accounts and trust funds.  We have a so called democracy; yet notice how Parliament, with dozens of socialist regimes over the decades, ever moved to class holding offshore secret accounts and trust funds as tax evasion.
While I disagree with the food banks comment I do agree that the royal family have become unbearable Harry and Meghan accelerated the Queen's death
We havent had a legitimate King, Since Richard 3rd.
Bit of an home goal this ,King Charles is your woke Dream monarch also if we weren’t spending 7 million pounds daily on refugees we could use that money to increase nurses student doctors pay once again Charles is your woke dream monarch so enjoy.
Look to the Government for wage rises etc.  We have a ROYAL FAMILY in this country of which myself I would not want to relinquish. They DO work and represent our country, bring much revenue in also. I CERTAINLY DO NOT WANT A PRESIDENT. If you don’t like what is our constitution go someplace else.
I will be belting out the sex pistols on Saturday. This is a fantastic post, I agree with this bloke on just about everything 👍
Christ help this country if the likes of yourself get to be charge. First time on your channel and the last.
Check out what they did to all their former colonies
I used to work in the Alps and there is nothing cooler than seeing a group of French soldiers with their shades on drinking wine in the sun.
I'm pleading allegiance to the people and people like yourself fought for our country and not the crown,I hope we develop a country which isn't corrupt ,I turned down officer school many years ago, you pay the price, you are exact in what you say
I'm a US citizen, but I remember a royal wedding in the U.K. that was highly televised about 40 years ago. There was a lot of pomp and circumstance.  The streets were crowded with people, and there were reporters asking some of them how they felt about the event.   Many of the people gushed  about how beautiful the bride was and how magical it all was.  Then the reporter asked another woman who was obviously not in with it and was very angry. She stated that she thought it was all a waste of money and that the money could have been used to help people who were living in poverty in the nation.  I was  only 17 years old at the time, but I knew that woman was right. The same was, and is now even more true here in the U S, as well.  The waste in our government is sickening.
“Inbreed morons” 😂😂😂 You sir are a hero! 🫡
They uses witchcraft to rule (most kings) and if you can find the sources of the witchcraft then they will fall. Remember the read dragon comes alife
If the monarchy had done their main constitutional job which is to protect the people from the kind of tyranical government that is in power now you might have a different view.  Sadly the present incumbent and his predecessor haven't and didn't and thereby rendered themselves pointless. Be careful about a federacy. You might get a Joe Biden.
A system with  charitys that is greatly run by the people's own money depends vastly for all kinds of support for some peasants to survive, says a lot about true distribution of wealth of a well explained regime.Maybe the only reason it manages to survive, without the times past people dieing on the streets it prevents this to  happen in modern times?
Just because an ex soldier shares his thoughts doesn't mean to say he's right
From RSA I agree with you.
IM UP FOR A REVOLUTION ✊🏻R WE THERE YET
Just hang tight fella. The 1st world is getting geared up to REVOLT. Of course, America will be the bloodiest. But "ordinary" folks are tired and very sick of the likes of Its internal Crime organizations as well as the "external" So just sit tight and wait for that Fort Sumpter moment to sound its call to arms..
They should compensate the Irish for the genocide of 1847.
British born and I will never ever ever bow down and celebrate this bullsxit!!!!!!! While we have homeless veterans 😡😡😡😡 Buckingham Palace  alone could house all the homeless veterans nevermind the rest of there castles that sit  empty most of the time .....I for one am disgusted to be British....thank you soldier for what you did I respect you 🙏
Whàf everyone forgets is thàt we actually own all Royal estates and their contents.
It’s not the royal family you got to worry about it’s all the foreigners that have taken our country from us. We brits are weak and pathetic we have allowed our once country to be taken.
Not that we upstart secessionist 🇺🇸 have it sorted (wk in progress), but "The Establishment 🇬🇧 commonwealth" model has been/is much as is suggested: An absolutely thuggish self-serving monarchy
I like quiche, thank goodness I don't need the coronation to enjoy it.  I think Joe should say how he REALLY feels about the monarchy; I think he was holding back here.
I am glad that white people are finally awaken and fighting amongst themselves for the removal of their king. Think about all the worth and trillions they stole from Africans ( Trillions of gold and slavery. I am glad that white people now knowns that their enemies are thier own leaders and not the black man. They looted from Africans to only enriched just themselves.  I can't stop laughing 😅
Cannot argue with everything this man says we'll said sir
It's so inclusive except if you are non religious or atheist or 37m British who are not recognised
Well, actually we haven’t had a revolution in the same sense in this country. The English Civil War was not a a war or revolution fought to improve the economic lot of the people. It was a war fought on the basis of religious divides and against the personal, intransigence of Charles Stuart’s style of Monarchy. You have to go all the way back to 1381 and the (failed) Peasant Revolt to find a time when the snivelling, grovelling people of this country actually stood up to their Master.  Whereas, just about every other major European country has had a real revolution.   This is this the problem. And…..the modern day Serfs will be lining the streets for the £11 Million Coronation and dancing their support in the street parties in every city, town and village. Pathetic.
I absolutely I agree with you that's the way I always seen it since I was a child it's all crap
There’s an underlying narrative in this country to hate the French. The more I learn about them the more respect I have for them. They do not f**k around. If they don’t like what their country is becoming, they take to the streets and they let you know about it. No messing. I think we’re overtly and covertly encouraged to dislike them in case we start getting any big ideas. We have protests yes, but everyone turns up, waves their little banners then goes home at the end of the day to Netflix and a hot chocolate. The French will fight til the job is done. Everyone bangs on about tanks with 3 reverse gears but historically and even today in the present, they smash the gaff up if they feel the need to and in many cases get shit done
The ENVY / Jealousy is strong in this one. Complains the coronation cost 100 mill but ignores that King Charles gave 250 mil to people struggling to make ends meet.  Not tax dodgers, all of the royals pay taxes, even the King. He got to power being a gangster??? He got there by an accident of birth.
Lovely
dead right -  well done
Should have ended the monarchy when the Queen died. Charles, his fat fingers and his bloody mistress are a joke.
Great explanation of this crime syndicate but you forgot to mention king sausage fingers best buddy Jimmy Savile the superstar DJ nonc3 OBE
Not my king
Well said, but you need to know its the Papacy in the Vatican, which controls all of mankind, The Pope has three powers under a succession of papal bulls, complete dominion over the whole earth, all estates and property, your physical body and your soul. Your birth certificate is part of it. Look into UNUM SANCTUM and the three parts of it. The Roman Catholic Church is a front for the most evil and barbaric institution humanity has faced in over 1500 years. Check out the work of the late great scholar of our time, Jordan Maxwell.
Their relatives are our main politicians.
I would love to get a full view of the lovely quilt on the wall behind you.
Round them all up, stick them on the Windsor estate, put a big fence round it and leave them to pay for themselves out of benefits WE the people deem to be sufficient (I.E. not very much). Confiscate the other 16 properties (castles and palaces etc.).  Redistribute the funds to we, the people, and shut the whole monarchy down.  Turn Buck Palace into a homeless shelter and have done with the whole lot of them.  I’m sick of this whole charade.  Watching King Charles wandering around a food bank at Christmas was the final straw.
Your videos are so informative. However, I feel that the use of video clips throughout undermines the overall message and makes the points the person is making less poignant. Might be something to consider in the future.
Good video. I was taught about the civil war in school though 🤷🏻‍♂️
No fan of Charles for sure. The only problem with all this is - look what France ended up with - repugnant little Macron as head of state. Frying pan/fire
The generate more money for the UK than they cost. Thats good business for 1000’s of small tourism orientated businesses in the UK.   This is not a convincing argument. The reality is they provide a traditional constant for many, and above all, they are ours, for better or worse, its a link to our great and difficult history.   He’s right that we need to celebrate our revolution.   Ok off with their heads. Lmao 😂
Putting a family above every other family is immoral, and to say it's gods will, for fuck sake wake up.
Our revolution in the 1600s wasn't quite what it appeared to be.  The people behind it and it's aims were not what most people (including myself until recently) thought they were.  Read The nameless war by Archibald Ramsay.  It shines a light into a very dark corner.
Unfortunately, this country is irretrievably infested with forelock-tugging, cap-doffing, snivelling, grovelling, under-educated Serfs. They fall for this ridiculous Charade.   Great video!   👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I agree 100%. Get rid of these corrupt leaches.
#notmyking
If you  scrap the  monàrchy you would need a president  but who a old politician or an entertainer nobody would me happy still rich and poor.
Hard working folks can't afford to pay their bills,who feel like scroungers because they rely on  food banks to put food on the table,paying taxes to finance the lifestyle  of these REAL scroungers,who are major shareholders in the big corporations that are ripping us off,and are detrimental to health and wellbeing, pharmaceutical  arms manufacturers, big energy companies,etc...People need to wake the fk up,,The UK taxpayers are paying a lot more for this institution than we are led to believe,as with everything, you have to DYOR!!
Cromwell's crime was closing the theaters - that awful, puritan shutdown of Merry Ol' England, that sour, prudish destruction of one of England's greatest gifts to the world: William Shakespeare et al.  It's why, in reading history, I've always cheered for Charles II, that fab, funny womanizer who reopened the theaters after his Restoration (the 1st having had his head chopped off).  I see a direct historical line from that merry act to the Beatles and Monty Python's Flying Circus - England's other two great gifts to all.  Now all England stands for is MI6's theater which is lethal and may end us all.  Bear in mind I'm part Irish.  My DNA screams like a banshee against British monarchs.  I especially loathe this sourpuss and Diana-killer, Chuck III.  What a hideous emblem for England's role in the world today as designer of armageddon.  I wouldn't mind seeing him dethroned.  Who would England vote for as monarch, if they decided they need one?  I nominate: 1) Paul McCartney, and 2) John Cleese.  Time for England to give us some merry laughs once again, as they go down with the U.S.Titanic.
Even our people are big fans of a walls say that they're going order the royals haven't even bought order is still prime loads of stuff is still being stolen and pretty much all water boils do is going to stop stamp on a piece of paper and read a speech what four prime minister had written I would say I work in 2 the royals forebet in the past and when I think about it don't really need fun yeah very kind to do nothing
Don't forget the slut Queen!
They do pay tax.   Andrew and William can ware their medals. They served and earned them.
The Royal family are just puppets. The Real controllers of modern West, not just UK, are the globalist corporate class. They are the real enemy. Your anger is directed at the wrong target.
AGREE 💯%
I couldn't say it better, my friend. Never been a royalist and i will pay homage to no man!
HooooWee! Shooting from the hip there, son! You may be onto something here. The King Gustav of Sweden is ending the monarchy there, starting with his grandchildren, so maybe it'll catch on. Can't really see the Windsors going quietly, but who knows? Brave to come on out like this though. Cheers.
Trouble is iff there is no royal family there's always a dictatorship handing out orders and sponging in the same way.
Wow, this man is gold! But the whole thing is much bigger and has to do with a occult world agenda and world gov/dominant in which Royal British fam have an imp role, it's a lot to debate but is also dangerous 😵‍💫
I can honestly say I hate them, they all need to be gone.
Please remember tourists go to Britain for the Royals.  Sorry you are so bitter but they do a lot of good too....yes there is privilege  but all people are human...however some of them are very entitled and make bloody stupid mistakes for which they must face prosecution like the rest of us
I was in Colchester with him he's all about Jeremy Corbyn labour supporter so take what he says with a pinch of salt
Only 15k likes highlights the problem!!!
Charles can kiss kiss kiss my arse
But then Rotten recently comes out saying GSTW was not an anti-monarchist song...  Funny that. Only a few soft years after a selling a butter substitute.   Smells less like teen spirit and more like superficial self serving intentions. So so far removed from true political anarchism.
They royals are NOT an honorable "family"....they are a CULT. Surrounded by sycophants every day !
I'd be up there yanking the string.
So true the British civil war is severely underplayed in history curriculums. There is a reason why, because god forbid the British people learn from this
Why support the Royals when they are not interested in their people & Country. The prince is the instigator in we the people have been put under control by the WHO they have nothing to do with healthcare, only Genocide & are connected to the NWO,  a bunch of psychological nut jobs
What do we replace them with. Do we want a Johnson or a Trump,I think not.
Never been into the royals, I always wondered if those medal heavily pinned uniforms where well earned. I think what you said only reinforces my consciousness in this matter.
Waste of public money , ABOLISH Them .
Come and see the violence inherent in the system!
He fantasised about being a tampon inside Camilla😂 how anyone could treat him seriously. His mother is descended from the worst of the worst war lords. What a joke royalty is. Jerks.
King Charles talks about ‘scaling down’? Then give up some LAND.
Why do we need the services the Royal family have  more medals and decorations than all the services put together send them in to sort it .
He couldn't pledge alligence to his own wife with his known concubine mistress
We cannot mention the Paedofilia topic, nor can we mention the deserved Guillotine in Britain. We CAN in America however. I tip my hat to this Soldier, who carries a brass pair, saying what EVERYONE is already thinking. Perhaps we can do an exchange programme. We send you the US Administration, you send us the Royals, and we let JUSTICE PREVAIL !
I'd rather the country was ruled by a Constitutional Monarchy than an Islamic Republic !
When we have a revolution, where with officers and soldiers loyalties lie, king or people?
In case you missed it John Lydon became a fan of the Queen. I used to be a brainwashed sheep and was the ultimate monarchist then I woke up and instantly became a republican.
(Not my King!)
If you really think that the royals are the real cause of all the problems in Britain, you are woefully ignorant. They are an easy target but the wrong one.
Well said Sir!  What most people in this country are unaware of is to what extent the rancid "royals" and much of the aristocracy were actual Nazis. They supported Nazis wholeheartedly as evidenced by the late "Queen" Betty photographed giving the Nazis salute, surrounded by her 4parents and family. These cretins are inbred utter scumbags are detested by all right-thinking people. I believe that the supporters of monarchy either have a vested interest in its continuation, they are simply stupid or brainwashed by the non-stop msm "royal" propaganda outlets.
A 'President' ? Be careful what you wish for.
As a Canadian I've always found it embarrassing that Canada still has the British monarch as its head of state.
I think you may be a bit off on saying that Charles and Camilla Parker Toilet Bowl, should be relocated to a  council house. I say they should be housed in either an old council house potting shed or cellar...
Pledging an allegiance to Charles is almost compulsory, but not only to Charlie boy, this pledge if sworn, will apply to all the other Royal hangers on, even Prince Andrew! not forgetting the traitor Harry.
Rather be a citizen than a subject.
They should pay taxes not the tax payers paying them. Why doesn’t he pay for the coronation the tax payers shouldn’t pay for it, people can hardly afford to eat and pay their bills.  All that money could provide shelters for the homeless.  Why aren’t the homeless put in hotels instead of thousands of illegal migrants which costs tax payers millions.  Charity begins at home, something is seriously wrong in Britain, it’s not what it used to be when I live there, so sad to see what has become of it.  No strong leadership since Maggie Thatcher.
I always love as a child watching the queems speech at my grans. As whats better than getting almost nothing for Christmas as times were hard up north in my home but watching the queen dripping in gold and her massive diamonds in her crown always warmed my heart. Growing up as a child i hated watching the speech knowing they have so much and we all had so little and she always said we should all be greatful for what we didnt have. I learnt about that royals "we" at a very rarly age. We will struggle. We will overcome. We will cut back. We will persevere. We will have to buget. You just know that royal we never meant her and her family.
I was never a royalist - but I wasn’t really bothered really. The last 3 years this government and the royals themselves have made me into an arch republican!
Oh yes lets have a republic….like France? Going well there isn’t it? Who will be our head of state? Sad Sack Khan? Tony Bliar? We may not like King Tampax but we do need the monarchy but it is better than the alternative.
It is definately time for a republic...... long overdue! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Everybody I have spoken to about the coronation couldn’t give a toss.
Great content as always DDN. Thank you.
PRO PATRIA REPUBLICA.
What made me laugh is recently seeing Charles holding a Field Marshalls baton, there he was walking around with this ostentatious baton in his hand without ever having fought a battle in his life, does he actually think he merits the rank and would he be able to look a bona fide Feld Marshall like the late Erwin Rommel in the eye and still think he should be grasping such a baton.
Your so right what your saying they do not know the real world not a clue. Im finished with the royals  game over.
well said mate
Thomas Paine made the perfect response to the monarchy in Rights of Man. I don't know what the monetary return to the nation is but there are costs so is there a benefit? I tend to believe the monarchy justifies the Establishment that is arguably corrupt to its core, and we need a clean out of all these purveyors of corruption.
im 74 and never believed in the monarchy mate,all countries are run by greedy criminals.
We are all entitled to our opinion Pal! As a former UK Veteran myself I remember you who refused to put himself in harm's way when needed! You are a disgrace and a coward who clearly promotes his far left, woke political views
You gotta be a special kind of stupid to support the monarchy, or to join up
Do not forget:  they push green communism to create hatred and people are more submissive to the monarchy.     Different monarchies and the green left scam are the same.
Arthur Scargill had it right: his aim was to see the Queen working in a corner shop & living in a terraced house.
To sum it up: they belong to the global kabal of stanists.
Joseph Gregory Hallett has the real coronation stone...!!
Truth is revolution in the empire of lies
The monarchy is all about self preservation. And the public have been propping up their paranoia and grab for power for 1000s of years. We are even willing to die in their name WTAF😡
I’m sharing this everywhere …well done , the truth is coming out! A true Brit 🇬🇧💜
King Charles is a traitor to our Commonwealth of Australia's constitution he is involved in the UN Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab take over of the western world sold to foreigners unelected, unrecognised One World Government
Pledging allegiance is worship by any other name
When he got married 1st time , they took a days wages off everyone serving in the forces as a wedding present , so I'm informed
An excellent analysis. The British( English) are too caught up in the whole class system and Hyacinth Bouquet aspirations. The Windsors are at best irrelevant, at worst a disgrace to humanity with their billions from their evil empire.
He’ll give our culture and heritage away to other people not of this country a joke once a royalist but no more
Never forget They conquered the Saxons and Celts ,by the use of brutality and scorched earth .
“His chubby little fingers”, lol I agree with all of this 100% I would love for it to be put to the vote and actually see how many people would like to see an end to monarchy.
Charles best friend Jimmy Savile and Andrews best friend Jeffery Epstein is enough too prove these royals are evil
One name: Jimmy Saville.
The money that's spent on the coronation is a waste, but it wouldn't be spent on nurses or teachers if it wasn't spent on that; as we've already witnessed, it' would be spent on the arms trade, or would be siphoned into private companies where MP's get pay back, they're all corrupt, the aristocracy that forms these two faced governments are equally culpable and vile.
People are living through a cost of living crisis, yet the taxpayers are paying millions for this narcissistic bullshit. Jug ears didn't pay a penny in inheritance tax on the vast amount he inherited from his mother, he should pay for this sham from his own coffers.
before countries, there were kingdoms and these lands were taken over by the revolutions.  there is an agenda that has redefined borders,cultures etc. is it wrong,is it right? i don t know but certainly it has created the world in which we live!
An oath for an oaf or it’s off with your loaf.
Pledge allegiance to the Nurses Doctors the Workers and Our NHS, not to Big Ears the the billionaire who's never worked a day in his life, who Scrounges of the Public Purse.. Big Ears is nearly as low as the Detestable Putrid Scumbag Conmen tories..
If you don't like living in a monarchy go and live in a republic, I also was a soldier and served for 23 years so I can say this, you are a disgrace to the uniform.
I have never liked the Royal Family,  they are murders and arrogant and they don't give a dam about the public,  it amazes me why their are so many stupid Royalists that think they are so wonderful and that the sun shines out of there ar sses,   they think they know the Royal family but they do not.
To quote Christopher Hitchens, who was himself quoting Thomas Paine, "A hereditary monarch is as absurd a proposition as a hereditary doctor or mathematician."
❤ THANKS  for  sharing  this  informative  & educational  video.  🎯 You're  absolutely  CORRECT !! That's  why  many  many  countries  monarchy/royals  collapsed  eventually.  It's  very  tragic  that  many  people  blindly  worship  this  licensed  bandits 😂 🤣 😄 😅   2023May04th, Thu
Only 1 King, His name is Jesus Christ,
"nae king, nae queen, nae lord, nae master, we wilnay be fooled again!"
Absolutely so true. I'm 71 and a life long Republican. Royals and commoners alike scrounge money from hard working tax payers.  The flag wavers are the  uneducated and unemployed.  A word of warning watch your back. Trust no one.
The monarchy’s immunity and the privilege that is extended (and can be removed) to us from the crown is the façade that the establishment hides behind and benefits from. The first and most important thing which the English must achieve is a Parliament of their own. When that is established everything else is possible.
6.52. What a dive!
If you can go down on your knees to George you can do the same for Chaz.  I’m on mine already. Down on your knees to the Lord. As for History lessons i always thought there was a real bad smell about the ww1 and ww2 as neither my school, father nor grandfather wanted to tell us about it. Well my relatives were traumatised but i fail to understand a grammar school in the 60’s-mid 70’s not finding room in the curriculum for at least the war that the kids’ parents fought in. They had made a fuss over 1066 in 1966. Yet i can recall them producing a map, showing where the incendiary bombs hit, in an edition of the annual school magazine and they had a war memorial outside the chapel (which was vandalised).
For a well exposed image of King Wingnuts search *bob moran rein* , try not to laugh.
Windsor Ltd want their family business to survive intact. They understand which direction the winds of social and economic change are blowing which is why Charles attends WEF meetings and is bosom buddies with people like Klaus Schwab and a long list of other globalists. By his saying nothing about the massive 3rd world invasion of the UK orchestrated and approved of by your leaders Charles has betrayed the indigenous people of Britain who were loyal to his ancestors and died for them in endless wars over the past 1,000+ years. He betrayed his people for money and power. Nothing changes.
Excellent
The king should work for the people our new king works for the WEF and the Rothschild’s  ( German, German) , so why would we want to be ruled by someone who is not  (working ) for us !
The Royal family are nothing more than parasites.
Damn, this should be viral. Dutch crown exactly the same.
The monarchy keeps the class system alive, and should have been abolished when the late queen passed.
Would you have liked being born into an institution that controlled every aspect of your life? Though not.
Preaching to the converted here in the Republic of Ireland in the peaceful trading bloc of the EU, a century after gaining independence from England. Just six more counties to return.... Chucky ar lar ☘️
T H E Y       H A V E       N O       A U T H O R I T Y .
If the royals bring in money, why don’t they become a private company?
They are parasites who feed of the people, as if we were the host......
Great video. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Biggest gangsters of them all, damn right. Big perverts too.
The queen has taken land, lots and lots , here in canada also and doesnt pay a penny in land tax.
No Bloody President...it will end up costing as much as the Bloody Royals...We Do not Need an elected whatever....we already have a PM and we have ambassadors to perform the other stuff...  SMALLER government SMALLER taxes.
I make you right mate we should get ride off the royals we have Charles running around with bags of money and the taxpayer paying 12 million pounds for Andrew for a woman he never new we are using food banks and living in poverty so wake uk
He is going to swear  alliance to Islam that why he is hiding behind a curtain, the first king or queen  that has ewer don this man is evil do not forget the army and police force and mps all swear the oath just think about that and shake in your boots
A Nations Conscience   A Nations Identity  Poetic Justice And...apart from the Ideal situation of realizing "One Equal Light" John Donne - the One Universal Awareness of  'Live and Let Live' which education is gradually helping people towards, it would be a valuable step forward to stop the stolen Stone of Scone being used at the forthcoming Coronation Service as a genuine gesture - apology to the originally Sovereign, Free and Independent  People of Scotland for all the disgusting treatment the Scots have had to endure from the english down the centuries even up til now.
We should care about the coronation because it is taxpayers money going into it
Charlie Boy.  Just another corrupt, hypocritical PARASITE.
Windsor or saxcoburn
I have a question for the speaker: "Why now?"  Why wait until the passing of Queen Elizabeth... before you openly campaign against the existence of monarchy?  Why is King Charles any more of a gangster than his predecessor mommy?
Look right, just shut up, turn your brain off, wave your flag and bow down like a good serf.
The monarchy can easily described as first class parasites and walking pestilence !
Would bring more money from tourism if all the buildings they owned were open to the public. They’re criminals.
Your problem is that, without a constitutional monarchy ( no political power), you are going to  be stuck with a republic, with an elected head of state (i.e. a politician). Just check the track record of republics. It´s not pretty.
Be careful what you’re saying people who speak out have a habit of going missing be careful
I loved the slavver when the death of elizabeth was eventually announced . " She provided stability" wailed the morons . Oblivious to the fact that the country went to shit while she was queen .
Spot on he is a sell out globalist he is supposed to be the first among equals. He moraly bankrupt
The main stream media is completely locked down, music, art, movies all conform to the ruling class
Great comment sir a voice of reason in the madness
What the hell are you on about? We have probably the best standard of living in the world in this country. Why should rich people give up what they have just because there are people who have less? It's just sour grapes. Not only that but you're free to mock power and have your say but the monarchy couldn't exist without the support of its subjects and you have shown nothing except a string of personal insults against our king. Where else are you as free? Calling them gangsters is dumb and so are you.
Research Charles and his deep ties with the WEF! (World Economic Forum)  He's a king who's planning on becoming the worst tyrant history has ever seen!   A king who as a prince, had his wife offed... and now his lover will be queen consort! 🤦‍♂️
I,m also a former British Soldier and have never supported the monarchy.   NO presidents.....I don't want a president...we don't need one...we need less government not more...The Dutch have 75 Lords....we have 770???   why? it is insane.   Tourists come to UK to see buildings and pomp....Russia has no Royals yet is has palaces and Guards.  same for France.
Scotland has seen through them to a great extent. Very few want street parties. You’re talking about Charles 1 who was executed. Known by my class at Glasgow Uni as Charles, the thick as two short planks!
I love all the medals they wear, there are that many one would think they fought in every war ever.
As I have said before: - 'The Apple, (Head) does not fall far from the Tree (Block)!  Another who would employ the aid of a foreign power to secure his position?
Bring on the Republic
Charles is a WEF (Klaus Schwab) member (as is Harry and the last several PM's talk, "build back better" (ie their globalist reset) and that, "you will have nothing and be happy" (ie slaves?). So then, who will protect us? The Great I AM and soon all will see it as He re-sets them as at Red Sea Crossing long ago!
Viva la revolution.
Bring back Oliver Cromwell mate simple 👍
42 monarchs since 1066 hardly any were any good to anyone apart from themselves.
Sorry but I'm disappointed, he exposed nothing that isn't common knowledge 🤔
An interesting view.  Originally at least correct. I'm not sure I'd like a presidency though.
It reminds me of poverty, actually.  I get very cross
Not sure this does DDN much good this video, we need arguments based with statistics, not opinions. I don't have a problem with the royal family, I am happy for them to be there, royalty in the rest of Europe are not a problem as I see. No need for the french model. But what I don't understand is why we are still keeping them, paying the monarch hundreds of millions each year, still in the 21st century. The arguments that they pay for themselves are baseless, and french tourism hasn't really suffered for lack of a royal family has it. We can keep the royal family, just stop paying them, they don't need the money and if they are here to serve, well let them serve.  The problem is, the role of the royal family is simple, to survive and to keep things as they are. That's why we have armed forces who's allegiance is to them. Trident isn't for our protection, it's incapable of saving you and me, but it can protect a king and their lands from invasion.  I fear it will take another world war to remove their tentacles from our finances. But then we are in a similar situation to world war 1 at the moment, just different adversaries and pacts to intervene on other nation behalf. History shows 80 years is about what it takes to forget the follies of the previous wars, so the opportunity to change things might happen sooner than we might think!
Not me pal. I have no time for these parasites!
The only justification the sychophantic royalists have is they bring in tourists and money which has been proven to be complete garbage. That money would still be generated if we abolished the monarchy tomorrow. The top ten tourist attractions in the UK does not include one royal residence or anything to do with the royals. Bunch of parasites.
He never  mentioned  Charles  the second,  who fled to France because  he was so hated.
Absolutely beautifully projected , it's all banks funding all sides and anti evolution
So agree!
Get rid of the ‘royals’  Flatten the pyramid- power to the people!
£100M does not take account of the disruption to trade and commerce on Saturday and the further losses on Monday.  Long past time that this outdated group of entitled parasites were got rid of.   Oath of Allegience?  I, for one, bow down to no man or woman.  I am as good as, if not better than these plutocrats and their unearned wealth.
The elite in society know it is important to maintain a monarchy because it secures their status as elite. As royalty maintains a symbol of elitism in the consciousness of the people of a country so they know their place. This is why it's important to abolish it.
true words bro
Gosh I find anti monarchist so ever so tiresome.... Yeah let's get more Corp elitist jerks instead. What absolute dead stupid take on it all.
That Charles wants people to pledge allegiance to him is disgusting. The only King I pledge to is Christ the King.
love this guys perception in exposing these criminals
share share share everyone
This is a very brave man and absolutely spot on! God bless you sir...
Do I need photo ID?
Do you have any comment on the Kings demand that ordinary folk swear allegiance to HIM? Given that the Military make that Oath, to The Crown, not to Parliament, not to the people not even to Democracy?  I have read many accounts by combat veterans who asserted they were killing other workers - all troops ae workers - by permission or their oath to The Crown, and that was OK.  Looking at the way veterans are treated by the Military, and by Parliament, reducing support, they so obviously need  to the caricature of 'Help for Heroes', ignoring the fact that they were forced by command structures to commit war crimes The command structure leads all the way to The Crown.
We have a failed leader installed here in the colonies.  We are serfs again. We are ignorant about it. What to do?
The Saxe Coburg-Gotha cartel's power is an illusion, they could lose it all in an afternoon. People are waking up to them faster than ever before and this is a mortal wound to them, but a wounded animal is the most dangerous. All hail the great resist!
They're Hapsburgs,Germans😂😂
Stopped watching after 50 seconds. 35% tiny pay rise?? BS!!!
I really can’t understand those people that can’t see what an absolute joke the royal pricks are.
Andrew was best mates with Jeffrey Epstein at the height of his sexual offending. Charles was best mates with Jimmy Saville at the height of his sexual abuse. Coincidence??
Let's go,where N when?
Although honour is something that seems to have largely passed you by.   It is  has to be an honour for you   to live in a country where you are allowed to come out with your vile hate speech and suffer no consequences !
Just so everyone knows ,  Knowsley Safari Park brings in more money . The Windsors contribute fair enough , but they're takers not givers when all said and done .
Even in my US public education they talked about parts British history such as the Magna Carta and Oliver Cromwell. Kind of sad if they aren't teaching British kids their own nation's history.
I can understand where you are coming from but just look at the rest of the world with all the leaders from various institutions surely all of them are just the same even worse in some cases all in office to Rob us of our freedoms there will always be them and us as long we have holes in our back sides you have to work with what we have and look after yourselves because it won't change you either support or you don't just live with it
The time of kings and mates rates is gone , 🔥☠️
You sound like a jilted ex. You went to fight a war everyone told you was bollocks and now you're opportunely railing on our countries monarch with the flag in the back for clickbait views. You both killed for country only difference is they own it. Grow up.
There's no 'exposé' here ... just someone ranting about how they despise the monarchy. He has a right to his opinion, some of which I agree with. Charles is a detestable idiot, but let's not have click bait. In my case it guarantees that I'll never watch the channel (or any other channel engaging in it) again.
Speaking personally as a Canadian he's not my king We should abolish Any control they have over Canada why should we keep paying for crap that is no use to us
What irritates me is that you will still get some fools waving flags and cheering as old fat fingers passes by in his coach.  do these people not know he is taking the piss.
Thank you joe for telling the truth about the parasites of humanity, their assets should go to the NHS and build a better society, the men who went to war for the royalty came back to slavery and poverty in the country they fought for
It'called Stockholn  syndrome
God ,what are you on????
Kim jong charles:)
He couldn't be loyal to his first wife, and for me, that was the test he failed.
Do you seriously think anything would change if they all quit tomorrow? All you will get is president Johnson and president Blair. 😱
Great content.  Charles is the most selfish monarch in living history.  No respect for him and believe this will be the last coronation 😅
any man or woman who singe's' on the dotted line and swears oath is part of the problem, and whilst your against the royals you still fly the flag, i have no flag not even the george flag, i don't follow bull, never have done, its a disgrace what's happening today, like you said they can afford this puppet show but cant or wont pay the nurses.
Hi there your telling the truth  but they are much worse than that I would not like one to babysit for anyone
Actually UK and US are the most corrupt fake democracies! King Charles received over £1.2 billion into his trust from Ossama Bin Laden Saudi family. His brother Andrew made lots of money from fake Shells companies offshore while working as trade encoy, without declaring it or paying any tax.
No trouble with the ZIP then ! TRAITOR 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
SCRAP THE MONARCHY🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
PLEASE  SHUT UP .   WHO ARE YOU TO LECTURE US ????   STAY IN YOUR LOCAL PUB . 😂😂😂😂😂
Rubbish ,
Seriously, we set the trend by killing the first king. What happened to us?
He should know the people who are train drivers get paid more than soldiers so don’t lie
Outstanding!!! Thanks.
Private Eye has just published its souvenir issue. The headline is "Man in Hat Sits on Chair."
LMAO, couldn't agree more.
The tragic reality is many Brits are infatuated with the spectacle. KC3 has lately made obvious he is promoting the WHO, the WEF and the NWO his dear papa was so famous for....He had been a Nazi and made the comment " masses are useless eaters " while he was the most famous world gigolo, living high from a woman who was given the throne, without any real qualifications, except the main one, which was to massage the subjects so they would not notice the deception and the grab ! To pretend to be running charities while you are a parasite is rich !  How pitiful to see such a display of arrogance, decadence and entitlement.  The world is indeed ,  in a tragic impasse.
I am sorry to tell you all that the Sex Pistols 'God Save the Queen/King' anthem,was make to help Queen stay in power. :.... And Cromwell was from the Elites ,  Ha if you don't know this but first kings were Black etc .. Anyway yes the new king is not good.
I was actually disgusted when I read that he wants people to pledge allegiance like he's some sort of all powerful god. Fuck him and fuck the royal monarchy. Ever since I've been old enough to understand the concept of the monarchy I've opposed it as to my eyes it literally makes no sense and has no purpose. They are but a drain on society's wealth and progress...
Thousands are spend on the glamour of the coronation while thousands are groveling in poverty, hunger and misery.
They are Reptilians. To have them cut a ribbon for a charity cost the local council thousands in protection.
Sausage fingers = cannibalism
Ooooh, this person is speaking my language!!!
Mate if you lived in Russia or china you would not have the freedom you have here to criticise the establishment. Just think about what you have now it could always be far worse😱
There's so much nonsense about the royals bringing tourists like the UK doesn't have anything else to offer. We would still own the buildings! Its not as if they are greatfing everyvody as they get off the plane. We could look to france that has makes more from tourism than us without any royals.
...no-one is perfect...even the Former British Soldier....
UK citizens are shit off the bottom of the Royals shoe, but dumb ass people turn up at parades to wave little flags.
The nurses lol when do you see a doctor or nurse’s going to a food bank this man is sooo woke 😂😂😂
Surely the first British Revolution was The Peasants Revolt - I always remember the quote "When Adam delved and Eve span - who was then the Gentleman?.  At heart I am an egalitairianist - however I find that we are a class-ridden society and people do not want equality if they think they will lose out.  In my lifetime we have a situation where the gap between rich and poor has increased.
To hell with Republicanism and Republicans!  I am a Royalist and have zero time for anyone who isn't. In fact I've ended friendships over this before
Thing is, their purpose isn't to be popular, That's just a means to safeguard the role. They aren't some celebrity prize winner or tourism booster.   I don't like the family, but their purpose is constitutional and we need them whether we like them or not. They have wide ranging extreme and absolute  powers they dare not use. If they didn't have them, sooner of later a politician would assume those powers and use them. An elected president would cost a lot in elections,  often being a dirty politician that has already been kicked out of the PM job, a party member who would think nothing of being biased and probably acting in an obstructive mode to the elected chamber. If you think the royals have hoky dealings and not paying taxes to themselves is bad then think how much squalid corruption would smoke around a tory president. They are not just our head of state either, it would break a link with all the other commonwealth nations .
Right on, Joe. The new 'king' had better pledge to rescind his connections and support for despotic, globalist cabals such as the W.E.F. the W.H.O. and the U.N. and swear homage to the British people and remember that we are SUPPOSED to live under a parliamentary democracy.
The only thing you got right was your self description as a traitor and a disgrace. Stop describing yourself as a former soldier. I normally agree with DDN, but I can't stomach your pseudo intellectual shite.
Your description of the royalty is the description of ALL political powers.  Hopefully  your words will be the call to the worlds' citizens to awareness and to stimulate action.
I'm with the Celtic fans on this issue
Charles has signed into law an Police Intimidation Laws .Surely that tells us all.
So much to agree with but the caveat for me is that, as any revolutionary successes  in history have shown, it doesn’t take long for their leaders to become as corrupt as those they overthrew. There will always be leaders by default and in order to stay at the top, they need to exercise power over the people. There isn’t really a solution.
Just the fact that he is WEF should worry the ordibary folks.
Well said, thank you for speaking out! I’ve been saying for years the monarchy should be disbanded!
Your just like him you’re woke 😂
You were happy to take the shilling .Would you want a President like U.S.A .It makes no difference who the head of state is but we have only had one for 70 years the Americans have had one every 4 years and a head of state would cost the same ,so we can use him as a tourist attraction or do you want to destroy the Blackpool tower as well There are plenty of things that need changing before you need to alter a unique  system that works,Remember you fired the gun for for all these Gangsters as you call them and I beleive you might have already sworn your allegiance to the Queen and her successors
He’s not even the real king, the real king lives in Australia
When average people in the UK start getting poorer the kings throne will start wobble and maybe then majority will understand that UK does not need king in 21st century and get done with it....
Viva Le France evolution rrrrrrrrr
Yawn ,Yawn ,boring Muppet .
I agree
From across the pond, I’ve always been a bit curious about the monarchy. I did respect the Queen but still wonder how the subjects justify keeping these people in opulence while they strive to have a decent life. All men are created equal so why worship and give such power to a few who can control you and can take your freedoms. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Bollocks
I never realised how porky sausagelike his fingers were. I think his name should now Abe Froman The Sausage King😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Charles should remember Charles the 1st fate
Good to see some one saying out aloud what I think to the public 👍👍
Joe......I love what you are saying.  Thanks .  Sara x
As much as i have no time for the royals ive even less for this faux wokin class ero..who has blind and wet spot for millionaire corbyn and his wreath laying hamas buddies....ya didnt go back to afghan cos of any principles mush, we could hear ya knees  knocking from the naafi 😂
Yeah I think Mr. Charles is a larper git.
Wow. This guy sounds like he's read the works of Karl Marx at least twice. If he had a Russian accent instead of a British one, I'd swear he was a Bolshevik reincarnated. We get some of the same socialist ideology over here but instead we call them, "Antifa" and "Black Lives Matter". You, sir, have an AWFULLY high opinion of yourself.
I love this man, but I'm a Monarchist. We just need A REAL MONARCHY, not a PRETEND ONE!
If you look at the history of the monarchy over the last 900-800 years it has been a struggle between the monarch and the forerunners of parliament/parliament, with parliament coming out on top. The monarchy is just a paper tiger and if the monarchy still exists it  is because our parliament allows  it to exist. If parliament got rid of the monarchy I bet you the waiting list for housing would be just as long. If the monarchy were abolished then all those lovely landscapes etc. would be parcelled up by the very rich for themselves.  The ordinary man and woman would find no appreciable difference to their everyday lives.
I couldn't agree with you more thanks for this video..... the UK people need to wake up to what's really going on with the royal family scumbags the lot of them they live the high life while the rest of us struggle to put food on the table for our family....
Yes you tell the truth they are thieves, war mongers,like kids quite horrible don't you believe it   Charles is  not o don't know anyone in my family who will watch this sheeple day
Stay mad weirdo
God save our g£orious muppet.
Replacing a hereditary head of state with an elected one will solve nothing. It is the state itself that needs to be abolished. Replacement with a horizontal organisation and the the enforced disappropriation of the land, and capital of the current ruling classes of capitalists and aristocracy. Only then can the people be free to exercise their will.
You are not a traitor  you   telling  the  truth   they're   not helping  the   people  in   your country but  have money  to  go to war with  ukraine   why people are using food banks one of them got money from the newspaper did you donat   it to charityI bet  you  lined  his own pocket that's  why  the  tour was a disaster in Jamaica🇩🇪🇷🇺👩‍❤️‍👩
The Days of Kings and Queens should have been OVER, A LONG TIME AGO - In a Constitutional Republic, The People are CITIZENS - In a Monarchy-Kingdom-( Kings Domaine )-  The People are" SUBJECTS" , Born to Serve the Crown, and be " Subjected" to a Peculiar form of Wage Slavery -- just Saying ...............
LARPERS! Yeah! 🤣
Great to see soldiers seeing through the bullshit
I like history and the tradition ! Don't worry you republicans, you won't be any better off without the monarchy! You'll also have to find something else to moan about!
Guillotine sounds fine to me.
THANK YOU. He is the end of the royal monarchy in England, a fraud from day one that NEVER accomplished anything of real merit. Even his mother would not appoint him as REGENT, in her declining years. SHE KNEW, Bless her Soul.
Now said to be £250.million for the coronation. They claim they don't meddle in politics, well the Queen was head of the Illuminati the lucifarian club, they claim many thing but the Queen lobbied parliment to hide her real offshore wealth fro you Joe public. The royals are in the kasarian Mafia, they earn millions by arms shares, child trafficking and more, even head of the WEF and the depopulation agenda, so lunatic psychopaths answer to Charles now. They sold our sovereignty out for them to keep the royal family in power. Charles is now worth billions, as is his sons and grandchildren, even Charlotte has over 10 million in the bank. And your crooked Tories tell you they can't afford your pension or benefits, they have stole from all of us .
I don’t support masons crooks murderers privileged they are not representing the English people in uk what so ever all they have done like the politicians is ruin United Kingdom with invasion of illegals 😮and as for this debacle at a cost to tax payers disgusting foot yourself the bill not us
Out of date 😅
The MoronAchy must fall
Yes of course and nothing really new here.  This is how the world works.  Power and affluence is the eternal name of the game and it is always ugly, and The British Monarchy are symbolic of how rotten a charade it all is.  But of one thing we can be certain - nothing is going to change.  Enjoy the day off and bollocks to all the rest. 🖕
All your videos are negative... maybe you should take a long hard look at yourself and workout why you're so miserable... People like you just stir up hatred and refuse to see the good others do... The Prince's trust, King Charles charity has helped over one million people out of gang's and sponsored youth who have fallen by the wayside, and helped them into job's... Prince Philip and Charles have always been way ahead of their time when it comes to climate change.. They were both saying plastic and waste will polute our planet... I could go on about the good charity work and service the royal family give to this country... But I feel it would fall on deaf ears... You are clearly someone who is unfulfilled in their own life. Most people who complain and find fault in others usually are... I pray you see the light and find something meaningful in your life...See good, do good...be good 🙈🙉🙊 May God enter your heart ❤️
“The royals bring in tourism money”  Unoccupied palaces, like the palace of Versailles, brings in more money to France than occupied ones bring in to the UK, like Buckingham Palace.
The only problem is that politicians are not a lick better.
Let’s be honest, “our revolution” has been the Murdoch press which has hijacked our democracy and firmly entrenched the oligarchy in power, all while making the masses vehemently believe they have a choice.
Maybe it's head cutting time again.
If we became a Commonwealth next year, with an elected president, what would change? Not much, frankly. When the young Elizabeth was crowned, my grandad, a bit of a prophet, said she'd be one of the last monarchs of the United Kingdom. Everyone laughed at him, then.  What gets our craw more than anything is that this new king is somrone who once declared he wanted to be a woman's sanitary towel.  Not good.  If permitted,vthe UK would vote either for William V,  or Anne II, a hard-working, no-nonsense lady. What do you think??
fuck the king we do not kneel
People like you never see the bigger picture. It’s not even worth a dialogue as you are so entrenched.
The great game…..democracy may not be perfect but it’s better then communism….but the WEF must be crushed along with the creeping fascist democracy that seems to have risen lately.
I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for globalist oligarchs. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.”― Smedley D. Butler, War is a Racket , a short book and speeches written in 1935.
Is Piers Morgan part of their propaganda campaign? Must be on the payroll.
Booo to them
Hopefully this former soldier will not commit suicide by giving himself a double tap to the back of the head or any other way for that matter.
Charlie will take the Royal Oath, but will it be the correct one, or is there something else going on? A big supporter of the unelected WEF,  NATO, and the WHO will he relinquish these organizations and support his people, I think not, Charlie is owned by the DS the Elites, he is nothing but a glove puppet!
If this lot lived on an estate or anywhere outside their fairy tale palaces, they would all be on the “At Risk” register.
Well said. There nothing but parasites. Living off other people.  When he sorts HIS garbage bent government out and the economy then I’ll show a little respect. Until then he can ram is Coronation
Watch the establishments PR machine go into overdrive now that the younger generation have no interest in the monarchy, can see the schoolchildren being brainwashed on the BBC News ( 3/5/23, 1.00pm news)by singing some song written about the coronation
Say nothing of the fact that he is one of the heads of the WEF - personally, I could care less of their wealth but I do care of what they do behind the scenes
Just selling off there jewels would help a lot of people. The Windsor are where the Romanof were, totally out of touch with reality. They only support charities that will bring them self glory
Very well said. I truly wish you brits could get you're own 1776
Let us not forget the soldiers abandoned by the political elite who used them to fund their private bank accounts, knighthoods, egos and their so-called place in history.
That family owns half the world, no wonder big C the 💩 snuggles up to the globalists to keep his porky digits on all that wealth. He is supposed to be first among equals first among sovereigns of this green and pleasant land of which each and every one of us are individual sovereign. He should in his oath be pledging his allegiance on bended knee to his people, to uphold the well being of his people and to not allow outsiders to take control of our sovereignty, well being and freedom. And what's he want to do instead❓Get us all to grovel at his feet while he sells us out to the globalists and his banker chummies by giving his royal assent to net zero, the cold killer and path to poverty, genetic technology and precision breeding, just a few. Not my king not now not ever. Made me sick to my stomach to see those brain washed unsavoury individuals cheer god save the king on the news just after the passing of the Queen.
Could not agree more ...brilliant
Buckingham Palace should be made into a museum - owned by the people - with all the goodies the royals have accumulated on display - after they have returned the stuff they stole - assuming, of course, there is anything left to display! The upcoming show of obscene wealth while people are sleeping in the streets and lining up at food banks is disgraceful! Wonder where Diana would have stood with this?
Is it true that UK royal males (no pun intended) have traditionally had a prerogative to keep a mistress or mistresses? William evidently has a very close friend (called Rose) who will be attending the coronation with the royals? An elitist and privileged approach to maintaining family values and allegiance I guess?
It use to cost the Tax payer £80,000,000 just to keep the Queen, £350,000,000 to keep the Royal Family  a dysfunctional family. The Royal Family is worth approximately 35 billion pound. They use to switch babies over at birth because they were inbreeding.  In the tourist guide the Royal Family don't get in the top ten in London and nationally don't get in the top 50. The main reason they now have pop groups performing around the Palace because if they didn't no one would turn up. Kevin Fox
I’m so tired of these entitled brats - the RF and the extended RF (Megs and Harry) - they do nothing apart form go on about their own entitlements and make money from tiles/marriage
I love the rich who everything.  They really do a lot for this country unlike the poor who go around moaning.  Any chance that Starmer could come up eith one inspiring policy? Free school meals for all school children? No.  He bent his knee and took a knighthood and will serve his master.
There is a historical connection between the levellers and the American and french revolution
I hear a lot of what you’re saying and it does resonate to a degree,  but the thought of a president is a something I just can’t muster any support for especially when you look at the clowns our closest allies have installed at this time . I’m a supporter of the monarchy with a small ‘m’ which gets smaller every year thanks to Harry,  Andrew and Charles but I didn’t have to swear allegiance to the queen so I won’t be swearing it to Charles either. God help us all…
I'm amazed you never mentioned the Republic of Ireland and our revolution. The republic next door, right under your nose must have something to teach you. Did you know Johnny Rotten is Irish?
The “western” world should be ashamed, coronating a king. Of all the out-of-touch infantilized things. Unbelievable.  Done with all hierarchies. They only exist to deny agency. To maintain tiers of permanent underclass. To re-sort all life based on their own nonsense designations. Anyone punching down, barging In to someone else’s agency, is upholding this system. I vote we coronate nature and the indigenous populations who singularly steward it. There’s your sovereign.
our royal family are nothing but leeches
Thank you, that was brilliant. ‘“I don’t understand Europe,” the Queen reportedly said, before the EU con referendum. Cameron let  it slip that the Queen was delighted when Scotland failed  to get independence. The royals always thrive under the tories. Together, they keep money in the upper echelons. Britain will continue to be poorer than Europe as as long as we have a royal family and tory government
THIS GUY CANOT EVEN EXPOSE HIS OWN BOLLOX,
---  *8 million* Pounds for King Charles # photo -- *12 million* Pounds on Royal Propaganda for Kids Book *100 ~ 150 est. million* Pounds for coronation *150 million* Pounds on Security  *Malnutrition in hospitalized children within the UK and Ireland on the rise while the Royals eat cake and celebrate.*     *THE ROYALS ARE A TAXPAYER'S BURDEN*
Can't see anything going on
Good to hear someone tell the truth about the so-called royal family.
United Republic of Great Britain or Commonwealth of Great Britain👍
I’ll probably sleep right through it 😅
Two of the invited foreign dignitaries are accused of torture and crimes against humanity by the UN.  The Prince of Bahrain for instance.   They got an invite, yet you didn't.  Think about that.
A good account of some of the main outrages of our monarchical/authoritarian society. Just one point: in talking of the French looking back at their revolution, he forgot to mention 'equality'. But it's clearly on his agenda.
Another disgruntled and shamed ex employee!
As an American with an ancestor who was a patriot during the American Revolutionary War , I wonder how he would feel about a crazy inbred prince who is living here in America , who is using our system  while making his comments about the flaws in our constitution.  What a joke this guy is ! He says he's living a life of service . To himself , that is . I also heard that the monarchy is worth something like 80 billion pounds ! This is unbelievable!  I wonder when the BRITISH people will have had enough of this crazy system ?

Lol when the Great Reset has its way and stops the vast majority of tourist flights…..what money will the monarchy bring in !!!
Interesting perspective! Just out of interest, who would you wish to become Head of State / President today?
100%
From this side of the pond could things be worse in the UK than they are now if there was no monarchy?
1 Love the Channel Title; Double Down News.  2 People losing interest in the Monarchy because the world is moving on, for myself King Charles does not have the same appeal as Queen Elisabeth II. our Government and institutions Have become almost openly corrupt, you can tell this by the way we lead to believe in COVID. that's just the start. I will keep this short, Plus too much internet and TV. Have a nice day 😃😃⭐⭐
"There's absolutely a correlation between the French getting rid of the Royal Family and driving fast cars". There's a bigger correlation to the French driving fast and the invention of the automobile, but I'm no statistician.
Finally, an ex soldier telling it like it is.
boggles my mind.  why never say all these  before and may be write a letter to your parliament to end the monarchy?   Instead you are saying all these when KC is about to be crowned a king? 🥺
Brilliant... could listen to you all day..
Oh my goodness. When the king loses the support of the Military, the gallows beckon.
Don't laugh at those sausage fingers...it's rumored they keep a Lady very happy!
well said mate viva the revolution
I've thought about this & I'm prepared to meet the King's request of my allegiance, half way.  I'm willing to commit to 50% of his request, I can confirm that I am willing to Swear At The King 💥🖕🏻
The love for Royalty is just another ideology, another religion. Any system or way of life that cannot be questioned holds back progress in society.
Worshipping reptillians in human bodies is sad as fuck. Get off your knees!
magic, thanks for the truth at last well done , personaly i saw the light year's ago whilst serving with 2 para, when i was an 18 year old para i stuck 2 fingers up to anne when she was learning to drive in a jenson. much love.
Fact is the Royals that are in now Wouldn't of been if WW2 Would of gone the other way
Careful.  You are really talking about t events that happened centuries ago. They were nothing to do with the current generation. Remember also, it was the British military who went out and conquered the world. So really you should condemn the military in which you served as well.   Why did you choose to serve in such a blood-stained organisation?
Agree with your every single word spoken sir . Parasites every single one of them.
King Chuck is a hypocratical globalist stooge, pushing ecological abstinence on you while he lives large. Do as I say not as I do.
How refreshing to breathe the wind of truth.
"We will not blame him for the crimes of his ancestors if he relinquishes the royal rights of his ancestors; but as long as he claims their rights, by virtue of descent, then, by virtue of descent, he must shoulder the responsibility for their crimes".........James Connelly Irish Republican , trade union leader and socialist.
Charlie and his buddies want a reset, we should oblige of course.
This is coming the young generation is going to ditch the Crown one or another time , and want  a more normal Government  with the power to the people and not only a few Lords that are making decisions in Government.
Brilliant.
Sold their Souls for fame & power. If they actually have souls anymore.?? 🤔
Thank you
The Most High God is the only King I pledge allegiance to.....
Parasites
Oh shut up! 🙄 The algorithm had epic fail putting this diatribe in my path! 😴
I have recently returned to Britain after many years abroad and the mines and the mindset of the modern Englishman it's one of disgusts for family has has done nothing but good for this country but good for this country and we have slags like this 1 Maligning them maligning them left right in the centre frightened centre listening to these people talk totally why this country is going down the hill once upon a time We looked up to our Royal family Royal family and even many of them even many of our politicians politicians but nowadays we've got nothing to look up to king Charles is trying his best hes best only to be created Why moron's flight this one. God save the king it's the one thing that keeps this country decent instead of instead of all these    Dishones conniving politicians.
Excellent excellent presentation
What's worse than being talked about is not being talked about.
Couldn't agree more with this vids message
How disappointing !!
Well i heard there were lots of festivals nd parties being cancelled due to lack of interest
Charles is not only about to be crowned as king (please note the small k), but it he who created the new world order, which glorifies elitist ideals for nothing more than the power and control that it provides. He is far worse an individual than most people could imagine, despite his attempts at showing his kindness and compassion, which is really nonexistent. If we believe that he will renounce all his political and religious beliefs, and that he will serve US, then we are delusional beyond delusional. And this comes from a former royalist, who saw the light sometime ago
Well, Charles is a huge hypocrite. For a start, he is head of the Church of England, and at the same time, he is filthy rich ( his private art collection, alone, is estimated to be worth £10,000,000,000). Why I mention this is because Jesus was quite clear that rich people will not be welcomed in heaven. Of course, knowing the arrogance of the Royals, I bet Charles believes he rules by divine right. The Royals are a disgrace, and so are the millions who support them.
Not My King
The BBC tries to talk down to Russia about democracy while supporting these gangsters. The King of Spain escaped to Dubai with the stolen assets of charities. Little wonder that the Russians believe they are liberating the west. Most of the world is laughing at this clown, but don't forget the devious minds of the Palace courtier many connected by blood to him, who are the real rulers of the country.
There are so many people that aren't bothered about this scandal riddled bunch now  that MSM s propaganda is laughable.I met Diana and it was criminal the way they eliminated her. Not my King you can tell the character of a man by the company he keeps.
I love the Monarchy. This so called ex soldier is talking bollocks. If and that is a big if He is an ex soldier then He should be ashamed of himself.
💯  absolutely right
Forget the relationships with brutal dictators...look at the list of his paedo friends under his own employ or the likes of Jimmy Saville or that Archbishop
I agree 💯
the Saxe Coburg Gotha's, the only nuclear armed mafia on the planet.
Well said. Thank you
Some people might be preparing but I have ZERO interest in someone who is most definitely not a Royal King but a King of Lies and someone who killed off the true Princess of Wales.. Lady Diana! And the nation wept when she was liquidated outside the country, because having her taken out in Britain couldn’t be part of the modus operandi! I rest my case.
What do you think about him asking his subjects  to swear an oath to him?  Or is it the W   E    F who he is the head of?  Why don't the people say enough with the monarchy?  It is the same as if you are pledging an oath to, and crowning Klaus, H Kiss en ger, Georgie S, and Billy G.  It is the exact same thing!  This is the end of Britain and the entire world when you anoint and crown him as God's own representative on earth!
From the womb to the grave..Rebellion.
I was in London as a tourist during the 70 years anniversary of the queen (by pure chance) and the thing that shocked me the most was seeing people from India cheering for the monarchy
I’m reading “The Clash of the two Americas” by Matthew Ehret. It spells every out. It’s a 4 book series. We’re in a moment where people can learn that the WEF is a product of the Royals.
Who in their right mind would swear allegiance to the tampax king and queen.
Whilst certain points are valid: vast land ownership; paying a pittance in taxes, and on and on ...,, I look at America and cringe!!! Would I really have Biden, or similar?  There is enough skullduggery and to spare in the US. In fact where is there government by the people for the people?
Portugal has a president who is a socialist and a champagne socialist prime minster. They are all glib, smooth talking elitists milking it for as long as they can, pretending to be the servants of the people. Republics are far from perfect.
People say, ‘Yes, but replace them with what? We need a head of state.’  Why? Genuine question: either they have no power, in which case they achieve nothing, or they have power, in which case they’re an unelected elite and should not be? Please will someone explain to me WHY a head of state is useful?
I LIKE THIS GUY ! HE TELLING THE TRUTH !
I ain't a supporter of your channel, however, what you had to say has some merit.
100 million pound would house a lot of homeless in our country,  or at least pay for shelters and food..  .....
As I’ve always said… the only good thing about the monarchy is we get a bank holiday when each one passes
Should've  said it when you were still serving. You swore allegiance to them don't back down now
God get rid of monarchy 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Interestingly, the former French royal palace - the Louvre - is the most visited art gallery/museum in the world. Now, imagine if Buckingham Palace ( owned by the State ) was turned into a museum/art gallery, I bet it would rival the Louvre in popularity.
Its all part of the 13 bloodlines that have rules for a few thousand years!  As long as this power remains there will never be change for the better of the people!  Our labor is being swindoled from us by these elites!
We do not need to level up, we need to level down. The top bankers in the City could end poverty in GB in an instant.
THEY STOLE THE REEBOK SHOE COMPANY FROM AFRICA ! WHICH IS REALLY REHBOK !
The People have the power to stop these WEF/ESG/WHO partners, like bud light etc. Don’t buy or fund them 1 by 1, mass defunding!   Totally non violent 😎
King of the great reset Charles the man who wants us to pledge an oath to that Entity?
You are pissing into the wind, even though I agree with your aims, there is no chance that the ruling classes will let the status quo slip. There is only one way!
AND ROBBED AFRICA TO FINANCE THERE COUNTRY  !
In the US we call the types who pretend to be soldiers and wear medals and so on guilty of "Stolen Valor".
Never minded them. They did a lot during ww2. The new lot are awful. I will say Princess Anne seems based. If she was next id be alright with that.
King Charles is a putrid anachronism thrown up from the cess pit of history.
I worked out the corruption of the Royal family when I was a young child. Daughter of a soldier father, now deceased, I could see that the queen had ‘loads of money’ and many British people lived in poverty. Pretty simple to see really, to me any way.
Royal is a liability. The millions instead should go to the people in medical, education, housing and other services 😮
WHEN THEY ROBBED HATIA OF $21 BILLION AND LEFT THE COUNTRY POOR !
THANK YOU SIR YOU ARE SO RIGHT THEY ARE GANGSTERS PEDOPHILES THIEVES HUMAN TRAFFICKING  MONEY LAUNDERING THE QUEEN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR  8 THOUSAND OF CHILDREN   GOING MISSING EVERY YEAR  THEY ARE DEMONIC ENTITIES THAT TORTURE AND EAT CHILDREN THEY MUST GO ASAP   STRENGTH AND HONOR
I KNEW THE ROYAL FLUSH GANG WAS GANGSTER !
Only got to see what happened to Diana.  Hush my Mouth.
THE ROYAL FLUSH !
I am for a royal family.. But can we get a new one!?this one is a bit weird.
Charles is disgraceful for not sticking up for his own son against the toxic media. Just like my own father .
NURSES ARE NOT ON A PITTANCE CHECK YOUR FACTS  THEY DO VERY LITTLE AND EARN MEGA BUCKS ON THE REST YOU ARE CORRECT
"Chucky" may go but "Lil Willie Red Dragon " Will be Worse.
I do not support this crap. The alternatives are far worse.
Welcome into the parasitic empire.
'Put them in a council house?' There's a massive waiting list. Put them in a HMO.
You weren't taught about Cromwell in history? Don't think you were paying attention then.
Sad git !
At the very least we need to cut them off of public money, they own like 4 million acres of land in the UK, I think they will be fine.  It's absurd, far removed from reality, that we in this time of suffering and upheaval are paying for this unelected person to have the biggest party in many of our lifetimes.  Enough is enough.
The French are fascists, I don’t think the French are any kind of example.
The Royals have no power. Their role is rather like the King on a chessboard. There to stop something worse occupying it.
Be a soldier to protect the weak bcuz the weak are the ones who pay your salaries. Don't become a soldiers to be a fool, fooled by the prople whom you vote to serve you.
If the only good reason to keep the monarchy is that it brings in money, I've got an idea that would bring in a shitload more, open all the castles and palaces to the public and charge 50 quid entry, the Chinese alone would bring in billions in the first year!
Anti Christs
"Frankie Boyle's Farewell to the Monarchy" on channel four says it all
The Monarchy is a symbol of Britain. They represent Britain. I love Britain.
Hahaha the whole thing is embarrassing! We need to wake up….
Since when did Princess Ann serve in the royal navy and how did she get all those medals .been wondering for years . no time for any of them ,saw the queens coronation in 1953 wont be watching another ,hopefully nor will the British people  cant wait for Australia to ditch them ,
Power corrupts, whether it is in the hands of people with noble ancestors or in the hands of peasants, or usurped by spoilt kids who have been tricked by dumbed down exams into believing they are more intelligent and better educated than their elders, but are of dubious morals, lack common sense, love censorship so long as they themselves are not censored, and are not above cheating to get their way. To put power into the hands of such people is madness, and any country that does so will quickly decline.
WELL BLOODY SAID !! I SALUTE YOU SIR !!
Well said. But the truth will fall on deaf ears.
❤️
God save the King. Love from Glasgow 🇬🇧
Always the Devil you know over the one you dont.
God save the king. Look what happened last time the government tried to overthrow the monarchy. Neither can exist without the other
just subbed you. great knowledge. common sense is rare where as brainwashing is running supreme.
If you want elected leaders instead of Royalty. Can you name one present day elected leader that is doing a good job ?
no different than the catholic priests at the Vatican wearing expensive robes to make people fear and make people believe they are the answer.  You should look at  these phonies all lined up in photos. They all look like women dressed up with very expensive robes to show you power!!!
That old chesnut beloved by the Royalist . They bring tourists and money into the Country which is utter b.s. and self delusion on their part . They come here for the history . the buildings , the castles , ancient relics and artifacts from time gone by etc  . O.k . now and then they might see the Royals but only on the odd occasion . You don't need to see them to view Buckingham Palace , the tower of London and the Crown jewels for example which begs the question what good or what use are they?  l would argue an irrelevant, pointless, obscenely expensive waste of taxpayers money and an excuse for these wasters to live lives of luxury off our backs for doing next to nothing .
The people pay for everything! All the ceremonies etc funded by the 'subjects' including the caviar and champagne. "Nice work if you can get it '!
Of course, America, without a monarchy are better. not. There are always others who will control the Dough.
Great video.
Nothing to be excited about this is the arbinger of the slave trade putting on a show
They are worse than gangsters. Gangsters are honest about what they do.
Cromwell did it right, but we then gave it back to the Royals....(?)
I think we need a new road to go down as a forward looking free people to take control of our own destination,  the House of Lords needs to go half of our Parliament needs to go and the Monachy needs reforming or retiring to its own devices after all they all own businesses they can look after themselves,  our political system is corrupt and broken and only works for the good of M Ps with self serving vested interests,  I think we need a president like the U S not a single party or a coalition mash up . We need a clearout of all that's wrong with our corrupt system , the same old same old too and frowing from one party to the other alternating and we end up with the same thing that we've put up with for over a hundred years or more , the swamp need draining and filtering
When this bloke says there is correlation between the French having great lives and not having a  monarchy, surely a index of the wellbeing of the collective is society, so why is it then that French society nearly have racists in the front national in power, many European countries have had extremists throughout their history in power, bar the united kingdom which has a functioning democratic monarchist system?
Catchy title ... I am sure that you will get a lot of views. I for one am going to enjoy watching all of the pomp and historic side notes on telly. Other European monarchs no longer have coronations. So, this may be the last.  William was not raised from birth to value such things.  Charles grew up under the wing of his grandmother, the Queen-Mum.  All of the old-style trappings of royalty were presented to him as the norm for a king. During the era of Geo. v, Geo. vi and Queen Elizabeth ii, the British monarchy punched far above its weight because of the post-WW2 order and the Commonwealth.  Times change.  As an American, I do not think that I have the right to weigh-in on the topic of the UK being a monarchy or a republic.  That is for the British people to decide!  I will say that Britain "lucked-out" so to speak, with Geo. v (WW1 changed family name  to Windsor and his wife Queen Mary who was, along with George v., very dedicated to Great Britain) Geo vi. (vs. the Nazi-sympathizer, Edward viii/Duke of Windsor) and  with Elizabeth ii (who took her duty as queen very seriously and who did her best for the country and the Commonweath) The late Queen-Mum and the late Prince Philip stood by their spouse and did everthing they could do to help their spouse, the monarch)
The US might as well have a hereditary monarchy with the criminal politicians put in office, do you think our pathetic president merited his office, or that he "won" 81 million votes?
When inbreeding and profiting from the slave trade are your main claims to fame...
You are spot on these are anglo yeddish turk mafia who invaded us put us into slavery and Whitewashed everything we know
The Bilderberg group are the biggest gangsters. The Royals, in place, keeps the country civilized.
This is Joe Glenton, who deserted the British Army and went on a drug binges in South East Asia. He claims to have seen action in Iraq and Afghanistan, but only did one tour and never once ventured outside the wire of his base.  He claims he refused to go on another deployment because he was against the war. But in fact he was a coward. What he doesnt understand that the army would agree they are well shot of him, as he was a useless storeman, cos that is all he was, a storeman and a driver.  The next shot he hears will be his first. He is a liar and a charlatan, and the only action he has ever seen is in a knocking shop in Bangkok
Nice video. One thing I thought about after Charles 1 the people did not cope without a king and brought Charles ‘s son back in to power restoring the monarchy. More detail about why this happened would be helpful. We went back from that point.
They history repeats itself ,well Charles be very careful . I shall wait and see who he serves . The British people or the WEF who I believe are is masters I hope I am wrong about him
The worrying thing I saw was the satanic ceremony of the opening of the Commonwealth games in London. King Charles presiding(head of the Anglican church)      What's going on?
What century IS this ? We should have stopped this nonsense long ago !!
Totally agree!!!!
Charlie boy is a proponent of the WEF.  Reason enough to get rid.
The royals own nothing it's owned by the city of London banks
Its the unintelligent sycophant's who keep these   parasite's in power
If you are looking for your brain dead followers, I think you will find them looking for a battery charger. Maybe you could borrow it from them !
You are 100% correct. I'm an ex soldier too.
WELL SAID. THEY are the biggest criminals on the planet.
Totally agree, thank you for saying it. Windsor was a Frankish name, a Frankish aristocrat built Windsor castle.
There’s an awful lot of envy here, like there are no astonishingly rich people in France and the US.  I also don’t think the French have completely recovered from the shock of their truly awful revolution, which resulted in the placement of a nepotistic warmonger on a recreated throne and the theft of an incalculable amount of treasure from an invaded Europe.  I don’t admire Charles either, and his woke hypocritical advocacy is certainly hard to listen to.  Most European countries have some sort of monarchy, however, so the system has some merit it seems.
We need a real life V for Vendetta. This government looks more and more fascist with everyday given their approach to immigration, to making it harder and harder nee illegal to protest or strike. We all need to remember the 5th of November and not only make it succeed this time, but let it take the monarchy with it too!
Agreed that this particular monarchy is clearly riddled with sinister goings on. But taken as an idea is it not ideal to preserve hierarchical order, or else risk the slippery slope of communism? Throughout nature hierarchies exist wherever you look. It looks to be the most suitable order of things.
We aren't born stupid we are made stupid. Greatness is achieved by stepping out of that line.
The fact you call yourself a soldier is laughable. You joined voluntarily during a war and then as you were asked to fight in said war you went AWOl because muh dont believe in fighting for me country.  You also want to rid the country of the monarchy and replace it with what? A president who will be as if not more corrupt and continue to live in the same palaces and earn millions each year, as if nothing is different other than theyre elected. I also bet that you would then complain and call the president a tyrant and the peoole idiots if theyre not who you voted for.
100 million for cake and balloons, meanwhile back at the ranch the  people are suffering, this is maddnes and not in an entertaining kinda way!!!!!!!!! so threre is no bread, lets eat cake then. Welcome to "1984".
There are more criminals in the Roral family than in Dartmoor prison. They are and always have been crooks the queem said she would pay tax which she did for the cash in the UK but Billions where off shore just like Charles and his money today. The land they own in the UK was not bought it was stolen. People need to wake up they do not make as money for the country than they take.
You are missing a very important point that was proved quite clearly during lockdown. The British don't want 'freedom' or even meaningful autonomy. They want a King figure who'll tell them where to stand and what to do. Think back 18 months, despite all of Boris' lying, hypocrisy, and (let's be honest) tyranny - millions hung off his every word and some still want him back in charge. King Chuckles is no different - the man is a turd but he's a turd people want to support. This is a nation of feudal serfs who will bow and scrape and grovel to anyone who will make their decisions for them.
It is well past time we got rid of this disgusting elitist system
I still remember Queen Elizabeth II who was suppose to be only a figure head Dismissed our PM Gough Whitlam in 1975 for the Yanks because he dared to put Australia's interests first .
I'd rather have an NHS Dentist than a King !
👏👏👏❤
When are the good people of England going to wake up !
Absolutely correct on all counts 👍
Fully agree.
The first time i see a soldier that is bully,,  be thankful that your dad dont have fat fingers.
They Don't Care they'll have their pound of Flesh and wit Pomp and Show. Like they Knighted Criminals like Tony Blair ,the Murderer of Millions of Innocent People, for Decades, still doing it.
There is an elite in every political system, if it's not this family it would be some other family, you are lucky though that you living in a country where you are allowed to criticise your leaders and you don't get arrested.
What a brilliant video ✊
The monarchy was deposed in the 70s to allow us to go onto the EEU therefore just puppets why is the cheater and friend of many peodos being crowned 👑.  People have forgotten Princess Diana's life before Camilla. 😢
Respect to you sir saying it as it is.. It about time the people of this country woke up.. 🇬🇧🇬🇧
I am CROMWELL  The Rambi Dee Channel !!!
Only one king ,ELVIS.
The royal family is nothing more than a sponging tourist attraction. They live a life of luxury and do nothing for the ordinary native Brits. Being ferried from a to b in first class luxury and shaking a few hands is the extent of anything resembling work that they ever do. We can't really say that everyone is born equal all the time we have a royal family. While ordinary hard working people struggle to make a living, these people live in opulent various palaces and don't care about us, they only care about amassing more wealth and power. Behind closed doors they get up to all sorts of nefarious activities, while trying to present themselves as an example we should follow. I am thoroughly sick of them all... 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮😡😡😡😡😡😡🤮🤮🤮🤮😕😕
Being a gentleman has served king khnum well, while in troubling and more peaceful times as lions can be great companions, you'd have to forgive me my indulgences and time at the smithy, and not always being the most diplomatic sort when it comes to outlandishness and grandiosity, and travel arrangements.
would love to hear his take on what happend to Diana
The end is near for the monarchy, Charles will join his mother in the ground soon, his already old. The whole system is on thin ice right now, and if he pops his clogs quickly, a second expensive coronation may push the people over the edge.  The true working class ceased to exist when Thatcher persuaded people that they will only be successful if they own their own home, that choice not only divided us, but it also destroyed the strong communities that built up around council estates.
You're trained to be an ignorant. Let  other people punch you and shout at you as part of training to be tough. Are you not tough enough while fighting and shouting with your own father?
Aw get over yourself
As an Australian,  I  will not be watching the coronation  because  I  can't  stand  Charles  or Camilla.  I wish we would  break  away from  the royals. I have heard so many horrific  stories  about that family, and I  tend to believe  them. I feel sorry for anyone who think that  the royals are pure as the driven snow. Time to wake up people.
Keep Fighting for the Truth, Peace and Human Rights.🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋
Not only a traitor, but badly informed, obviously green with jealousy...........so if you strip the monarchy of their wealth, who's next, nobility I suppose, and then rich people, middle classes and finally the poor ?........what about the money you receive from this video, giving it away to charity ?. If anyone tried to take my inheritance (not a lot) from me they would have a job.
Not being a fan of British monarchy I think the author is nuts.
The French had the right idea, and look how many people visit France each year...
The problem in this country is the government we have people in charge making decisions who have no idea  We have an elected government look how that has turned out?  So how will a republic be any better elected people like our current government taking our money and making a mess of things  We currently elect our government now and look at it?
The king and Pope the poor bow down and donate billions,one way or another, while they all hoard profits while their followers suffer , when will people wake up to the royal s and the church ,just tax collector s
The treasonous parasite isn't or ever be my king am a English as to my fellow sovereign living English we not ignoring British fools we never be party to the corrupt corporations calling self British Crown British gov British parliament it's one racket do as 100s of us rebut the fraudulent birth certificate welcome to the great awakening
King Charles upholds all that is great about a United Kingdom. He is patron of the arts and traditions and many societies that keep our society on track towards a shared and decent destiny. These  traditions, arts and crafts are the foundations of culture and dignity. Without preserving these - many of which have been neglected and almost forgotten, would result in a world devoid of colour, beauty and expression, a world without art, heritage, a people with no roots or traditions. People would forget where they came from and have no clue as to where they are going. Where would Britain be without our Royal Airforce and Royal Navy, protecting our British Army - the combined force that most recently stopped the Nazis from completely destroying human freedom? Who can represent the united people of the UK better than King Charles? A footballer? An ex-soldier? I would not accept them to represent my values on the global stage. I am thankful to King Charles and I support Him, and I would lay down my life to protect Him.
Fantastic; well said. Did anyone else hear a tapping sort of noise through the whole video. It was annoying so I put it on silent and switched on the subtitles.
The next load of Dross is religion ¬ Most started with a Spiritual Nucleus only to be reduced a control mechanism  , even the bible is corrupted although there is a truth inside it but hard to find !
Ever heard of the Jews?    FFS.   Do better than this.
A lot of good stuff here and, fundamentally, I agree. But lots of crude, incomplete rant.    UK had three other revolutions, Magna Carta (nobles vs king), inviting Charles 2nd back (rejecting the Cromwell option), and, later, William & Mary (rejecting Roman Catholicism and absolute monarchy for a constitutional monarchy). Post WW2 rejecting Churchill and setting up Welfare State was another, democratic, revolution. We need another massive overhaul and redistribution of wealth, land ownership, etc with RF just one part of the problem
You are saying exactly what I say and think. Good not to feel alone 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Me I pledge my allegiance to God, family, friends and Jack Daniel's
So very well stated, the royal family is a Crime Family!
At least the UK has an constitutional monarchy. The US has oligarchs.
You sir are an absolute genius, brilliant, brilliant speaker, erudite and informative, keep pushing the truth to the forefront.royalty🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
UK economy is crumbling.
Why would you say that
Charlie the big nose jew was a frequenter at Glencoe, jimmy savilles child murder lodge in scotland
What a load of tosh ,your no British soldier ,show us your medals
@etch-a-sketch 0 seconds ago I’m not sure what the soldier ‘exposes’. He is understandably and obviously resentful of the RF, but it his perspective the only valid one? As an American living in Europe, I can’t help but be critical. Is the root of his anger rightfully aimed at the RF alone? Are they the root of inequality and injustice in the UK? Are Republican forms of government less corrupt and more Democratic? I’m not sure! From my perspective, it’s not that simple.
The job of the establishment is to keep the power with the 1%
ELECTED HEAD OF STATE...................EVEN WORSE THAN WHAT WE ALREADY GOT!!!!!!!!👿💀☠😈💩
True Mate 👍. Have you not seen the French at the Moment the country is virtually on the Road to a Revolution in a Republic 😮. But its not being shown on Main TV news. Think you picked the wrong example.
Me watching from a former colony.....i actually am troubled that there are people who view them in good light😮
Charles quasi monarch of Cornwall.....my ancestors  were executed by them...
Maggots the lot of them
TAKE AWAY THEIR POWER TO DICTATE - DO NOT VOTE. THE PROBLEM IS NOT CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE - THE PROBLEM IS CIVIL OBEDIENCE. This is a guy who fornicates with someone else's wife while he is married and says he wishes he was her tampax...
👏  Well said  Lock up the royals  Return the wealth to us people
The royal family squat on the apex of the pyramid of the class system, legitimising power and inequality, dishing out titles and honours to maintain their influence. The media & other institutions whip up the deluded working classes into royalist fervour. We need a republic, where we are no longer subjects but citizens. ✊✊✊
Scots want rid of the lot Royals receive the largest amount of state benefits and contribute bugger all to the uk nations. Get rid. Republic now!
King talks to his plants .Soldiers lay down their life.
Thank you for your words that everyone even the American media is too afraid to say. The American media is drooling over King Charles coronation they have forgotten America's war for independence?  Look what happened in Scotland to the SNP and the fake charges against Nicola Sergent and her husband all to stop independence. Not one strke can happen during this circus and the so called Royal correspondents are disgusting how they treat Prince Harry and Meghan. The big sin was to marry a women of mixed race yet to be friends with a convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein Prince Andrew is still welcomed into Royal Events behind closed doors. There are pictures of Prince Andrew and the Queen all together with Jeffrey Epstein and Gillanne Maxwell  at Royal Reserdences. American main stream media are prostituting themselves over the coronation forget about American Independence
Look, I am 50/50 on the monarchy. I am extremely proud of my country, the U.K. However, I think people are missing the point of the monarch. The monarch is not actually the human being but a position. It’s a position that gives balance to a democracy and is the bridge between military and government. This of course is a loose description but it has worked, and works for the U.K. very well. Basically it’s stops a dictatorship. In my humble opinion, it’s worth every Penny.
They were born into royalty, not their fault, should they all just resign?
10,000 homeless war veterans say, not my king.
Sorry to tell you this,  it's the same all over the world! Welcome to the U.S. right now!
The only stability we have is a stable stream of unwelcome, uninvited visitors from overseas
You should have been an English Soldier, instead of a british one....
Well those Scottish & English Kings Charles 1 & 2 had a tough life, Charles 1st off with his head, and his Son Charles 2nd was just a womaniser, Charles 3rd just an old man.
I don't like the puppet-masters in the shadows who have considerable control over some of the issues he espouses. I'm also aware that he is required to stick to the script, or there will inevitably be consequences. The problem is, people like yourself have to be watched too, because they are likely to drag people in to a deeper and darker recess in the cave of ignorance.
👏👏👏
Led by Donkeys
I love these videos, but could we change the background music a bit?
How much has the Republican Party paid this Toe Rag who went on the run for two years with supposedly P.T.S.D Then he says he was a Conscientious objector which one was it?  why did he join the Army then? he now makes a living ripping into anything British an axe to grind no respect I didn't agree with the Afghanistan and other conflicts but I don't make emotional none sensible dribble toxic spew comments.
I think i need to read his book what a guy 👍
Wef
Bow to Jesus ....truth and love always
I totally disagree.  It's true, my ancestors fled Scotland for Nova Scotia to escape your King, but that was a long time ago.   Your King is once again my King, but he no longer holds the power to destroy.  Throughout my life, that power has been in the hands of the leaders of Republics.  Dozens of my relatives freely sailed back to England to save your country in the last century.   It was Winston that inspired them and George that united us.  The Republic of America was betting against you and they wavered and waited, joining us only to share in the spoils.  Your words are powerful and true, but you should target the ones who made you a soldier, who built your weapons and gave you an enemy to kill.   A new revolution is waiting for us to act, but now, in the 21st century, we have the tools of democracy.  If we embrace that power and put an end to our modern despots, there will certainly be dangerous upheavals.  The continuity of our powerless and peaceful monarchy may help us avoid chaos.  Soldiers make poor leaders in times of peace.  Their words and experience lead only to conflict.  I'm more interested in who you would vote for, rather than who you would topple,
One king Jesus the one and only
100% agree. They need to go. The Duchy if Cornwall Estates were STOLEN off two aristocratic families. Which were disbanded. Which had been 'given' to them by previous Monarchs. Its all about Land ownership the power they hold - and that land is STOLEN LAND.
Well said old chap!
I cannot stand the royal family. I still feel the utmost disgust when I remember Elizabeth walking through the poppies at the Tower of London. It made think of the congealed blood of the people that died as she traipsed  through the gore. It made my blood run cold. The rest of the sheep thought it was a wonderful sight. Unbelievable…how much more suffering must we endure at the hands of these monsters.
What annoys me, apart from Charles' complete lack of integrity in his first marriage, is that despite his face being on the money, he invests his fortune in tax-havens rather than in the UK.
Monarchy was there all wanted to hear about lady diana once she left ...Monarchy ended
I have only watch this for a minute  and I am so discussed  with you. A LOT OF JELOSEY  THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU WHY DID YOU JOIN THE ARMY IN THE FIRST  PLACE TRATIOR
The Royal family cost the taxpayer £102 million per year, I’m not sure if this includes the extended family of in laws, cousins, dukes, marquess, earls, viscounts, barons, the twice removed and around the corners. So you could probably double that amount of taxpayers money.
I totally agree with you. They’re a waste of ?non? racists space. I knew that the Rottweiler would get the Queen title, even though when they got married it was agreed that she’s not entitled to that title because of Diana, so she was bumped off, the old dog gets the crown. They’re not my king and queen. Let’s see how much he can screw out of the Duchy of Lancaster like he did with the Duchy of Cornwall. I object. From a true Lancaster Lass who thinks that we should f the monarchy right off.
Not even heard what you’ve got to say yet, but we’ve already declined 2 invitations to celebrate the coronation with others!  I will never acknowledge him as king.  Thanks for everything you do! 🙏🏼
Instead of brutal tyranny Brits use propaganda to control the country. It takes all those idiots in love with the queen to keep those who see the tyranny from disposing the king.  Love from the US, our propaganda is even worse over here. America the greatest country! Bah!✌️
Him Jimmy and roff harris
All about money and power
I wish here in Canada we didn't have them on our coin!   You're right they're nothing but a bunch of inbred entitled privileged elitist who really don't deserve to be put up on the pedestals that they're put up on!   I can't wait till the end times and we're so close to it because I'm sick of all this evil nefarious far left agenda AKA Satan's agenda!
I couldn't agree with you more. They are awful.
DDN = controlled opposition.
Saville's best mate, co founder of the WEF, wanna be Tampon. Not king material.
How English are the Windsors  Something to think about  Diana certainly rocked them to their core
The video titled "Former British Soldier EXPOSES King Charles" has created quite a buzz on YouTube. In the video, the soldier alleges some shocking revelations about the royal family. The video has become controversial; some claim it's just sensationalism, while others feel it's essential to expose the truth. Double Down News, the platform that uploaded the video, has been promoting it heavily, claiming it's "the video the monarchy does not want you to see." Despite the mixed reactions, the video has garnered over 10,000 views in just two hours.
The law locks up the man or woman Who steals the goose from off the common But leaves the greater villain loose Who steals the common from the goose.
The worst thing is they don’t have a job they just visit that’s bullsht
The British people are suffering from Stockholm Syndrome.  The truth doesn't care who tells it.  No lies detected.
not my King
1000% Agree with you!
Free masons keep them in place and wheel them out for PR purposes from time to time.
The qween was the last remenent off the tru monarcy king charls is just a globalist sympethiser
History is the key to everything. Not the revised version. The emperor’s new clothes, and you are the little boy pointing and laughing that he is naked. The establishment is very very powerful. It is a tall grubby overcrowded ladder to the top.
awsome truth telling joe keep on exposing the paracites   ...take care brother...
😂😂😂 i hate them and everything they stand f🤮🤮
Its a case of steal from the poor and keep it now
Former British soldier - Current British traitor & shame. Disgraceful and I'm just glad you can no longer bring shame to the uniform.
The Queen made the mistake of not making a big scene of handing the crown to Charles. The royalist and republicans would have given him the benefit of the doubt. But now she has died, the crown should die with her.
Can you stop, God already have plans for everything in this world,so you like or not it’s God plans, go with the flow bro stop complaining 😂
Well said 👏🏾
Why don't the British people get rid of the monarchy and get a digital AI computer type of one instead... It would be far more cost effective and all the royalist sycophant plebs would be catered for as they would be able to keep their very own digitized 3d virtual monarchs on their mobiles, iPads and computers...  just think of all the money and wealth they have being distributed to the common man releasing us from all our poverty...  Some bright spark could even create a Tamagotchi type one calling it "Monarchamagotchi"
"Windsor Mafia"?  Absolutely!  I have never understood how anyone can look back at the infamous history of Britain and see any glory in a bunch of thugs first taking over England and then taking over the world.  They aren't "Us"; they occupied "Us", in the same way the Nazis occupied their European neighbours in the 1940s, and with even greater brutality.  As this very eloquent ex-squaddie explains, they haven't switched business since 1066...
Down with the crown!
The Time is Now!!  Rise up and take back control. Thank you well and truly spot on and very accurate.
Amen Amen and Amen. I couldn't have said it better
We don't shut up about our revolution. All men are created equal, we can be what we want if we work at it. The playing field is never level, but it never was and never will be. We deal with it.  Beware of leaders who want to level the field. They lie.
King Charles the third should not be the head of the Anglican Church as he is not qualified.  The royal family is dead and should be abolished, should be called the rogue family!
BEHIND every King and Queen there is an Invisible Power not known to the Masses.  The Royals of the world are the Front for such Hidden  Power.   Video: Aryan Bloodlines of Ancient Babylon  Could answer some questions of such hidden Power.
I think our government are just as bad, cronyism, bungs, tax evasion, sex pests, lies and cosy contracts for their mates.  In my view the king and every MP should pledge allegiance to the people, and we should hold them to account.
Well said! Unhinged walters!
Dissent will be a thing of the past very soon. KC will go full Saud on the nation and forelock doffing will be made compulsory.
Charles doesn't give a shit about the people, he's shows us that when he crawls up the arse of the globalists and world economic forum, and is right into all this climate change net zero bullshit.
Unfortunately the British have become too dumbed down by the media and toxic so called medicines..💊💉💉💉
The english monarchy also carved up Scotland among five hundred families, and those families still own half of scotland today. Half. Of a country.  People make fun of the Proclaimers for that song Cap in Hand, and I cannot see why. One might ask the english the same implicit question the song asks. I can't understand why you let someone else rule your land, cap in hand. You had votes in Brussels. At home you are ruled by two unaccountable billionaires, smirking and preening.  If you don't end them with the force of law and the law of force, they will never ever go away, that entire class of idiot sadists.
My Dad. God rest his soul Always told me this as I was growing up Thank u.  You soo right  👍💞🤘
We have money for the king but not the plebs. People will come to see the palaces without the people. The Austrians did that
Brilliant post! Thank You. It's about time the sheep wake the hell up! The mon-achey are savage, brutal barbarians. The french are smart and got it right back in the 17th century!!
You're not wrong, also he is aWEF stooge
Moving statues with brass crowns.  They represent predators and bullies.
Sounds like a man who didn't climb the military ladder the way he expected and is having a little cry about it 😭🤣
U make a valid point but who would you have as head of state Tony Blair Gordon brown thersa may i think not I think the best way is to change our political system to wat the Americans have
It stands to reason that Charles is WEF, at this organisation just wants to re-introduce feudalism. Would Charles "own nothing and be happy"    i think not.
We need more ex military to admit they were not fighting for freedom or justice they were fighting for the Elite's who have destroyed this beautiful earth and stolen everything .from humanity as we live in the rubble thats left war is always good business and a depopulation agenda God Bless you for speaking your truth 🙏
What happened to the ten children the Queen and Philip took on a picnic when they were touring Canada those children were never seen again
A Monarchy normalizes a class system.  Disgusting.
Truths in this but simplistic way of describing our complex history.
The royals are a great symbol of our history and tradition and they link us to our past, but these royals have literally overseen the replacement of us britons in our own ancestral homeland without even so much as a whimper in resistance. Their whole purpose of existence is to protect the English people from tyranny. They're a relic, they've outlived their usefulness, unfortunately
Keep plugging away. The whispers are becoming more commonplace.
The kzarian mafia must go
Yeah lets bring down the monarchy and replace with a dictator. No thankyou.
How exactly democratic states are better off? Biden, Macron... Think before you declare yourself a democrat and wish for abolishing monarchy.
ITS  2023   NOT 1523    ITS SO SO OUT OF TOUCH  WITH PEOPLE  THE MONARCHY  BUCK PAL IS EMPTY  HE SAID HE WONT LIVE THERE , YET  WHILE PEOPLE ARE STARVING  THERE GOING TO PAY OVER 700, 000  TO DO IT UP  W T F  MAKES ME WANT TO PUKE   LET THEM EAT CAKE   COMES TO MIND
Good man. Always had a lot of respect for Joe.
The lies will come out.
Good that you’re a former soldier. I find it very painful to think about all the young lives lost for the “causes” created by the rich “elite”like the BRF to make money.
This dude nails it. He's saying royals but it's democracy worldwide that's the problem, politicians and politics are all charles with their fat disgusting fingers.
The irony of two adulteress people being crowned along with the media pushing the “ great love story” is repulsive to me.
You seem very bitter and twisted . Why can't we live and let live. The royal family do pay tax. How can you level things it would end up back to the status que. You will always have savers spenders , gangsters and horrible people. God save the king
As well as the Saudi royal family and other unsavoury characters, let's not forget old sausage fingers' close relationship with Britain's most prolific shellsuit wearing blonde mulletted sex offender. You don't get within a country mile of these accidents of birth without scrutiny from MI5 and Special Branch (Plus MI6 if you're a foreign national). He must have known exactly what Saville was up to so. Probably got abused by his own nonce uncle Mountbatten.
Didn't you swear an oath?
Between a death ceremony  and a coronation ceremony a budget probably £200 million.  Really love the pomp and show. Let the peasants rot.
Get rid of the monarchy e don't need them they are parasites
ddn   very well said mate every word was the truth  when talking about the windsor  mafia. i   have left the  C  of  E   CHURCH  MOSTLY BECAUSE  of him  how can he say hes a deFender of the faith     CHRISTIAN FAITH THEN SAY HE WILL DEFEND   ALL FAITHS  MEANING  ISLAM    , HES A  ADULTERER HAD AFFAIR WITH  YOU NO WHO  WHILE MARRIED TO DIANNA ,  yet that was all hushed up  hes taken suite cases of dosh  from abroad ,  dosnt pay death duty on his mums estate  treats  people like surfs   might say in arabic from islamic comic book  no he will never ever be my king  never    lets  go to a president  a republic   then the people get to vote  them in  . its 2023  not 1500 ,  hes been given the greatest opotunity  to   right the wrong  his ggggggggg  gradad did in spliting us from the  church  of ROME   we should be all catholic  as then    will he take it  no  hes turned to islam   not my king
Stability to the principle of inequality, is all they provide.
I'm always surprised there hasn't been a mass protest against the royal family in this country, given their role in empire and their unelected status and inherited wealth, maybe it's coming down the pipeline.
They say the greatest trick ever pulled was the Devil convincing the world that he didn't exist. The second greatest trick has to be the monarchy convincing the people of the UK that the crown is just set decoration with no real power.
Thanks again for another confirmation of things I've been saying for years. Time to get rid of bad rubbish. Keep up the good work with the interesting videos 👍👍👍👍
This is an opinion piece. It’s jealousism.
Disgusting bloodline and I will never respect this so called corrupt king who only interested in the WEF .
Spot on.
Now don’t make a mistake. It’s not only royalty and nobility. Today’s hidden kings and queens are the uktra-rich. They are much more dangerous because they stay in the dark. They are stealing our money and our lives.
Thank you mate
King Charles lll, or President Blair? Answers on a postcard please.
Not a great video, you could persuade some if you came up with one successful country that was so because they became a republic. Name one, or name the average republic model you would consider...Afghan being the worst, maybe Canada the best model -if they do remove the monarchy. What do you want? A champagne socialist lie or shared poverty for all? Trouble is people like you also fall on the woke/trans/brexit/lacking of common sense side of everything.  PS kids become royalists and more right wing as they age, so don't get a c stand from the views of generation woke. Pipe down crow. Maybe you should gi11otine Amazon or Antifa and leave the King be
WW1 was a family argument between Royal families in which millions died. Germany, Austria and Turkey lost their monarchies. Ours survived through religion. Remembrance Sunday is a religious event. The Coronation is a religious event. A lot of primary schools are C of E. Monarchy and the Church use religion and Conservative values to spread their brand. The most fervent, dribbling, toadying, Monarchists are church going, Conservatives. No wonder our Country has gone nowhere in the last 70 years.
You are 100% correct. The sheet have been programmed and there is nothing us thinking ones can do about it.
I'd love to comment but dare not. Im Irish 😂
Spot on. I for one shall be studiously avoiding the £100,000,000, flag waving, moron fest on the 6th. Like most working people these days, living from pay cheque to pay cheque, I've got significantly more important things to worry about , and will probably just dignify the occasion with a polite notice pinned to my front door, reading "Up Yours, Big Ears!".
I believe you 💯 but I believe Prince Harry would be a better King because he's a people's person and Duchess Meghan is an asset for England.
Its just like religion its indoctrination, this is so spot on. The biggest benefit recipients in the Uk but they are immune from the vitriol reserved for disabled, homeless, unemployed people. More medals than Muttley. Thomas Paine The rights of Man.
I don't know, buddy. We've got some pretty staggeringly evil gangsters here in the U.S. I'd put mine up against yours any day. The gangsters in the U.K. bring my U.S. gangsters their slippers when they come home from crushing democracies & bombing poor countries every day.
Charles has aligned himself with a cabal of unelected globalist's headed by Klaus Schwab. He must make a Royal Retraction & disassociate himself from this group, then HE must swear an oath of allegiance to the people & to our country.  Until he does this he can never be king.
The best fucking upload you have ever done. For the love of God and Country get into politics. This Country needs a new Arthur. Pull that political sword from the stone.
I hear he aided in Diana's death.
This is essential journalism. Thank you!
Two years on the run this Buffon before being arrested and imprisoned he has an axe to grind Bigot. Have some pride.
Not my King! No more Monarchy.
Totally agree
Actually one thing you overlook is that due to the Royals ceding all the profits of their lands to the government saves us all 38p in the pound in spite of drawing their expenses from the coffers.  The government does cap their revenue.
Are the royals just another pawn in a game played by much higher levels of players? Or are we all just looking for reasoning?
The royals are living proof that evil 😈  is very powerful ,in this world !
One must admit that the royal familiy lacks not of a certain entertainment quality. The only question to me is how long is Great Britain able to finance such uninspired recreation clowns. 🍷🎃
It's 2023 and somewhere in the world there's a small island, still playing, the mad Hatter.. Tea parties and the works.. Yet they sit with close to 300 000 homeless people.. A totally dysfunctional family at the top.. One overseas like his uncle before him, ran away with a actress.. Another one accused of having sex with a underaged girl.. Another one stating he wants to be her tampon?... Omg that was him.. The King. After they lowered Elizabeth into her internal resting place.. They should have kicked the rest out and put all the estates to good use.. Something that actually generates a income, for all the homeless people..
LOVE IT
I never thought I would say this,but you are right,when the queen was in reign I supported her,but charlie I found out has been spending time with Muslim clerics and Palestinians,well what about the Jewish people,what about his own country the British,he wants to say he is defender of all faiths,he is letting the Christian faith down big time,he meddles in things he should never do,he cares more about Islam than he does Christianity,now I will never support any of them ever again,we need to be like other country's,get rid of them.
Just to clarify my comment about the king paying tax,  The king voluntarily pays income tax and capital gains tax, alongside inheritance tax to the extent described in paragraphs 1.9 and 1.10 in the memorandum regarding his tax affairs. Tax is also paid on the Kings privy purse income ( which includes income received from the Duchy of Lancaster to the extent that it is not used for official purposes.  This was as at the 9th September 2022.   I personaly do not like Charles very much, as I see him as a week monarch who does not do very much for the Christian faith that he is supposed to be defender of. I believe he has some very poor advisors who are not listening to the people.
Being an Italian from Sicily, where the mafia has taken over everything from government to the Catholic churches, i definitely see how this monarchy resembles the same tactics as the mafia! Sad but true!
Agreed my thoughts too why would we ever want this in power such greed is unimaginable when you already have everything that you could ever want so why would you support the WEF if you are not a wanting to be a dictator 😮😮😮😮😢😅
Someone called Trevor springs to mind 2.36
Please do not disparage KCIII's medals. He studied his valet for years to earn the medal for tying his own shoe laces and nearly got his ears wet when earning his 25 M swimming medal in the shallow end of the swimming pool.
This video pretty much says what many of us already know  but in the eyes and minds of the brainwashed fools they see the royals as almost god like and to be loved and respected and if that's how you feel that's up to you but many people see it all for what it is and have no respect for it at all .
How Can a poor person be ok with this  i always wonder why they wear military uniform and medals
Spot on mate but we can have opinions but nothing changes the rich 🤑 stay rich and the poor stay poor. Royalty will be around long   after we are all brown bread. The British politicians and the lord's and ladies make sure the ordinary people are brainwashed.they look down on us plebes. 🇬🇧🧐👎
I'm ex guards I swore an oath of allegiance but that died when the Queen died, I have been disgruntled with the Royal family for years over there arrogance especially with the paedophile within the Royal family and as for Harry and his wife they should be banned from entering this country. I find the Royal family definitely out of touch with the British citizens especially the knob jockey of a pretend King I would never swear an oath of allegiance to him or his wife in fact anyone in the Royal family.  The Royal family is out of date, over paid and definitely lazy, useless we spend millions on them on their security and  Palaces  what do we actually get from them besides them spewing out globalists bullshit propaganda whilst veterans are living rough on our streets.
Come Coronation day I will be swearing all day long...
Amen brother. ✊🇦🇺
What were the bloody Irish taking about all the time , god but the Irish government has been overtook too , work ta do
If there is anywhere among the Western democracies a monarchic family in prime position to make a comeback to full head of state functionality, it is the House of Windsor in the UK. All the infrastructure and network is there for it to happen virtually overnight. So maybe it and a fair chunk of its idolising support isn't too unhappy at the prospect of a right-wing coup that could make it real.
Favorite line. We are still sucking up to a bunch of inbred morons. Love it.
I agree 100%!
This ugliness of the lock step jiggle suit clowns must retire.
Is that why your present Conservative government under Rishi Sunak is so intent on criminalising all forms of public protest?  We are seeing something similar in some state governments in Australia where the government structure resembles a federal republic yet at the top of the pile our acting head of state is a Governor-General representing King Charles.
It is not enough to get rid of the monarchy...it's a whole system of massive inequality.  The monarchy do not hold as much power as Big Tech,  Big Pharma, the military industrial complex etc. It's easy to rant about the monarchy but ultimately its not going to change much to get rid of them. In addition, a huge number of people in the country support them. You can despise them, and the left these days is very fond of despising ordinary working people, whether they are Brexiteers or Trump supporters. But in the end, you are just venting your feelings to no real purpose. This is especially so if you start personalising the issue. A good example of this is Prince Andrew. You need to be suspicious of the focussing on this individual for his    sexual behaviour because it diverts attention away from how widespread the abuse of women really is. The loudest male voices baying for blood are often perpetrators of the same crimes. Tony Benn always stresses that it is the system not the individuals that we should criticise and change.
get rid of the scum royals
Great post but that background music needs to go!
Well said mate gangster hidden behind pageantry
Wouldn't call myself a royalist but i do love our history & England has always had a King or Queen from as far back as you go, i would rather keep but obviously they need to be more in touch with the people & the reality that there is a real divide between the rich & poor, there are people that are fighting for survival, homelessness etc, & nurses on minimum wages, they should be along with all the emergency services one of the highest paid because they do the most important jobs, also while on the subject my mother who's just gone into hospital spent days in a room on the A & E ward because of a lack of beds, she's English in her 80's always worked paid her taxes & as honest as they come, the type that if she found a purse would hand it in, even if she could do with the money, that pisses me off, this country has abandoned it's own people
Sounds like a typical jealous British guy... I'm American and think the Royal Family is cool.
Out in the yard ..in the septic tank...THE HIGH FIBER TURDS FLOAT TO THE TOP.....
The worst thing about us British is that we doff the cap to the rich. The Tories get away with murder, as do the Royals, and we still think they should be above us. People (not me) should wake up (I have) to the state of this country and how the Tories are totally responsible, and the Royals just double down on it.  When we all decide to stop doffing the cap and see that we all deserve to be able to buy a basic amount of food and pay our bills, as well as have a little holiday once a year.  I think Labour is the only solution to bring back fairness.    Tories and Royals out.
No comment on why, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Spain retain their monarchy. Have they got a bad quality of life in those countries because they have a monarchy.
From where you sat in the grand scheme of things, Charles might look evil. Why don’t you try to imagine having a thousand year legacy under your control.  Oh no, your just a meager soldier who has grown jealous of someone else with a bigger destiny than you. His green grubby hands compared to yours  who fought for your country and killed but throw it all away because of the green you see around you. When I look at you , I see a fat old man consumed with green which is jealousy.
Bloody well said 🎉🎉🎉
Well all you people are letting this continue tax the taxpayers do nothing to show for it .  THE PEOPLE GO HOME AND CAN’T EVEN HEAT THERE HOMES OR FEED THERE FAMILY THE BASICS .  Go over to the Guardian and see how many bills the Royal Family has veto to benefit themselves .   There talking about Harry and Meghan but who’s talking about the family that’s out there struggling every single day . THERES SOME ARE EVEN STARVING RIGHT NOW  .
A great rising is coming ...  Richard Vobes
America does not tell the truth about our history. We are the child of England, just different names. Hope the babies can correct this mess.
Wait until the Muslims out number your native population, and they will, because they can have up to four wives. They will institute sharia law, then you will either convert or you will pay taxes to the Muslims, or they will behead you.
The royal family are parasites needs to be abolished
Well who ever got furlough payments and cost of living payments are also a drain on the state. Stop moaning. We have a republic with a figure head as head of state, not a ex politician who is elected and nobody recognises... President of Ireland? The monarchy do a good job and should evolve in the role just like our judiciary and constitutional government.
You evil piece of work
I will never be a monarchist but have some respect for them as it# British tradition but they are just basically like other corrupt billionaires who dress up their wealth by claiming  its all done for the service and duty of the country that’s it !! 😬🙄🙌👀💯👌
Im glad he showed the part he was being arrested and did time in a Military prison Disrespectful clown.
He is WEF and should never be King.

The French have better life than us, really. I suppose that the Russians have a better quality of life than us because they got rid of their royal family. Idiotic comment,
Eh does anyone actually care about the royals 🤣 i thought it was just the old people
If they were deposed of their power , how would they hide their immeasurable wealth, plundered over centuries of being, 'Brittania'...or more poignantly, who would then own that trove, another conglomeration of despots?...nothing much changes with humankinds  thinking, really, especially when you circulate with the 'elite'...times are folding in on them but the common persons plight will remain constant
The British Monarchy owns 19'500 square miles of the UK coastline, colonizing the full land mass. They own 31% of the UK inland. Their name Windsor is a lie, a made up name changed from Saxe Coburg Gotha, of German origin in 1917 so they could 'appear' to be British to the British public because British soldiers were being killed by the German army on mass every day from 1914 to 1918. For example on the first day of the Battle Of The Somme (July 1st 1916) British forces suffered 19'240 fatalities (deaths) and 57'470 casualties for three miles of French territory. The "Windsors" is as big an untruth as the Virgin Mary giving birth and remaining a Virgin along with the rest of the Bible, which the monarchy uses as verification of their control over the people of the UK.  United Kingdom - just think about that name KINGDOM - not France, Spain or Italy but a giant colonial controlling organization headed by ONE family....
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 a traitor to OUR Faith 😤😤😤 preaching to a Murderous Religion on our Saints Day 🤔 how dare he our Fathers and Grandparents will turn in there Graves    Thank you Double Down News   Islam, this absurd theology of an immoral Bedouin is a rotting corpse which poisons our lives
You are a drama queen (or should that be king!)  Better a Royal Family than a power hungry, here today and gone tomorrow elected Head o State - and, yes, all countries have one! The Royals will give total devotion and loyalty to Great Britain and the King & Queen will work tirelessly, with a work schedule that would kill younger people, to the day they die.   So be careful what you wish for DD.  We could end up with a Liz Truss, Sadiq Khan or even a Joe Biden now ruling the USA with a full blown case of dementia!   And whilst millions will travel into the UK because of Buck Palace, The Guards etc., bringing in millions of pounds worth of income for businesses and trade.  No one, not even the Brits would even walk down the garden path to cheer on a politician. Cone on, what would you replace King Charles with DD ??????
I wasn’t allowed in the Scouts because I refused to do the Queens allegiance thing and questioned why we should.
England is a cul-de-sac. A suffocating, styless, tattooed mess!
Sadly you hold radical views, I note you've not criticised our late Queen! For she was Loved, King Charles has a brith right but he won't be around for long! I stop short that King Charles is unfit for office but certainly won't be as popular as our late Queen nor will he going down in history as one. We can certainly wait 25 years for King William. We should remember it's not the intrusions at fault but Humanity ( Note I look to corrupt or emoral USA Presidents bring about water gate or sexual devantcy or financial corruption. The fact remains so that there has never been a world system that works & it's told in the Bible.. nothing is safe it never has been nor will be so until Jesus return to judge the world. So please stop your crying everyone will receive they share of heavily rewards. Our late Queen power has been taken away in death this fact comes to us all for we all have sinned & stop throwing stones upwards & look down towards those here in the UK & around the world with far less & help them. Actions speak louder then words.

Been the same since William The Bastard paid us a visit😁
Sorry but I am fascinated with the royal family and I am an American.
Totally agree and well said. Thank you for your service 😊.
And here we are, the Rats are out of the gate already causing hatred Division and strife to our great historical nation. No economical sense to have a Republic No stability for a republic and no Pride, just Indoctrinated Bigotry.  tell me if you can?  why the nation would be better under a Republic, and don't say economically I put to you your either that left you can't see right, you are Russian Trolls, or have an axe to grind,or your all just stupid. Or the followers of the Narcissist markel. I have therefore no problem calling you what you are Bigots.
The idea of a "royal family" is not just archaic, but it's utterly ridiculous🤷🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️.. Let's stop allowing this corrupt clown show already 🤡
Happy clappy socially conditioned humans rejoice as your cheer for your betters!
Making fun of a man's health condition which causes swelling in the fingers and pointing out a king owns a lot of land isn't 'exposing' anything. 🤦‍♂
As thoughtful and articulate as ever, Joe! And spot-on!
Totally agree. Imagine if other institutions were as nepotist as the royals.  Football managers, son or daughter automatically in charge of players, it would not work.  So why should it be, that in other more important institutions, it's perceived as good. It is now time for big radical change.
Democracy working.
Great respect to you very rare like you . Well said brave man 👋🙏👍
Ive always been a republican, I cant stand the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha
Outdated archaic nonsense. To the elite " all of them" we are nothing but lackeys, existing to serve their every whim. To start with the royals are not even British in origin, Germans, who changed their name to Windsor around the origins of WW1. Some of the earls, lords etc,  have held their wealth and titles back to the Norman conquest in 1066.  They serve no purpose in a modern world and strip people of money merely by existing, end their centuries old privileged lives now. Take back everything they have stolen from the country, land, wealth etc. Then return everything stolen from foreign realms over the centuries.   Then we have the beginnings of  a modern citizen focused republic.

BUT DO WE NEED A JOE BIDEN OR ANOTHER KHAN
Republic please......
The cap doffing peasants don't care.
SPOT ON!!!  End the feudal pantomime NOW!
I’m not a royalist but I’m certainly not a Communist
Agree  100%. I cannot understand why the lower classes don't revolt against the aristocracy and royal family. Surely with all the upheaval in the world and the injustice of society in Britain the time is creeping near day by day.
The royals and their pals are simply parasites on the working public
Great blow off of steam but a great video 👏, being a democrat from N Ireland I never had much time for royalty or all the hangers on that cling on to the Empire as though it’s relevant today…I have many great friends in England but their knowledge of real history ,as  you say they learn about unimportant history ignoring the fact that Britain was the main slave traders capturing Africans for their cane plantations in the West Indies …I would say about 98% of English people are totally unaware that Britain transported or sold 3 million slaves from the late 16th century until about 1820 , Britains longest reigning PM was William Gladstone 4 times elected PM yet his family were the largest slave traders in the world..In fairness to Gladstone he was instrumental in abolishing slavery to the West Indies, but his family received £95,000 the most Money ever paid in compensation by any British government  in todays terms would probably be well over a billion…
I dont get people who adore the royals . They look down on us plebs as anne was once heard speaking about a elderly lady who had made her a flowere basket . Multy billionare charles should be paying for his own coronation . The people are struggling too keep their heads above water . Shame on charlie

Important part of our history! I recently watched, 'The Devils Whore', (Michael Fassbender)..brilliant depiction of life & our struggles against inequality at that time👍
Your absolutely right I don’t understand these blinded people who adore the Royal family they are as corrupt as anyone else may be corrupt
Very interesting information
You’re bumbling peasants because you choose to be
I'm glad he's a former soldier. Talking through his backside.
Couldn't agree more with you, great video👍.
So you are a fan of Cromwell? The Monarchy has no power whatsover. Check out The City of London for the seat of power, by the way the Monarch has  to be invited to go in. Regarding owning vast swathes of Land, Land needs  to be managed, the land owns you ( coming from a farmimg background) St. James' Park would have ben built on if the Monarchy has not owned it. Thanks to the Monarchy these 'vast swathes of countryside, are looked after!
I don’t disagree with all that you’ve said.
Fantastic. 🙏
The whole idea of pledging an allegiance to Charles is laughable.
Britishers will be forever *public* but never a *Republic* nation
WEF shill = Charles.
I personally think this business yesterday regarding Buckingham Palace is a pull-up job a load of Lies bulshit an Astra swearing allegiance to Charles yeah and my ass is a blowtorch no chance and I think this attitude towards the royal family the younger generation I don't want them here's a thought for you who killed Diana Spencer well the gentleman that owns Harrods he knows who killed Diana Spencer and his son
well said mate
Nicely said
AND they call it…SOFT POWER!
This is a hard thing to say but, unfortunately, the majority of the British people these days would be too gutless and lazy to do anything about the royals, or anything else really. As long as Ant & Dec are on tv, or they can sit in front of the footie, the average person will do no more than grumble about the situation we find ourselves in today. And what a situation it is. An openly corrupt government in the pockets of corporations, supermarkets openly profiteering, energy companies essentially robbing us, people literally being forced out of their cars by local governments and exorbitant petrol prices, services being stretched to breaking point yet hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants being allowed into our country putting further strain on everything, people who will never be able to afford a home of their own but can barely afford to rent. It goes on and on and on and on.  Now we have this grinning goblin of a monarch, a man who is an adulterer, who's ex died under some very suspicious circumstances, promising to defend all faiths? I'm sorry but I cant think of a single faith that'd want to be associated with someone with that track record, it'd be like making Jeffrey Epstein the spokesperson for Barnado's.  He has never wanted for anything, never struggled for anything, has never suffered for anything his entire life. And this is the man we are expected to swear our fealty to while we struggle every day just to get by. What does it take to make a people break? At what point does a population say enough is enough? I fear that if it hasn't happened by now, it'll never happen at all.  The English Revolution was lead by strong, principled men of vision. They were natural leaders, educated and firm of resolve. I look at the young people today and I can't find any Cromwell's, in fact the majority can't even seem to decide whether they're male or female. There is no hope in that direction.  Sorry for the long rant but this video really pushed a few of my buttons.
RIP    K@NGA, DIANA, & W-I-LL!-A-M   C-OO-M-B-E-S.
Let's revolt ... take the money back?! Anybody can bring in money if they where made "Royal"??
I commented on another similar video to this one and I paste it hear again, quote "I go further I'm afraid, the day princess Diana had her very convenient accident in a very convenient underpass in Paris was the end of my royalist support, yes I know it all sounds far fetched but I can imagine that she was getting very much a thorn in the royal side, yes a wild theory, or is it. And now Charles who I can imagine was once told, yes marry a good breeder and carry on with Camilla is now a king, it all stinks to high heaven, and I never forget that it was only after intense pressure from parliament and the people that the Queen lowered the flag to half mast, she didn't want to though, and now the once third point of the eternal triangle, Camilla will now be queen, there will be no Homage from me EVER". unquote.
Original gangsters. Legitimated mafias. Not quaint, it’s a con
This isnt news, its opinionated propagander, I'm dissapointed DDN
Very well said, sir.    His best buddy is Clause Schwab the self elected head Of the WEF who is a Natzi just like his father who supported Hitler pre and during WW2.
This traitor has a book to sell, it's obviously not selling too well as he's now having a go at King Charles. Truth is, the Royals are a hard working family, very few people would be able to do the job and travelling they do.............This is an ex squaddy, took an oath (breaking it) and is attacking the Monarchy he chose to serve along with God and Country.  I'm not a big fan of Charles like I was with Queen Elizabeth, but this traitor has no grounds or justification for making false accusations and claims against the Monarchy..
Long live the Diggers!!!
The Royal family were responsible for WW1 with that little prick wilhelm who hated his British cousins I never understood why we still have a Royal family
Klaus Schwab world economic forum is Charles paymaster," you will own nothing but be happy" that's his moto
Still advancing the unproveable "former British soldier" tag as if it were a qualification for his opinions.
Problem with this take is that mentioning Levelers and Trade Unionism is that Syndicalism (Trade Unionism) is in itself effectively a Fascit trope.  Mentioned in the first seconds of this diologue were "hard pressed train drivers" -anyone want to guess how much a TfL driver gets (£59 to £63k on average) -when the system could have been automated years ago.   Then there are teachers -I have a 7 years old neice whose teacher took an extra day off after Mondays bank holiday, on strike, -so F8ck parents often scraping by trying to survive, many would have had to take time off and loose money to look after their children while Wraggy Annie stands around with her expensive pre-printed placard  demanding more money from hard pressed Council Tax budgets, not that I don't think Councils ability to miss spend council tax isn't a problem in itself, but certainly handing more cash to Wraggy Annie is not a good plan.    I over viewed how this bozo was teaching the 7 years old  in her class Maths, I've got to say -said teacher deserves a 30% wage cut not any rise.  -Example this is how she teaches kids to subtract  56 - 23 = ?   So the layout is as follows  50 + 6 - 20 + 3  =?   so subtract 20 from 50 = 30 and subtract 3 from 6 = 3. Add them together and get 33 -fine.   So I asked my little neice to do a similar sum, but now 56 - 28 =?  the result was a disaster, a tearful tantrum,  the child obviously could not conceptualise a carry one format, so effectively the next stage in this 7 years old maths progresion is to unlearn what came before, but of course this is a teacher earning £26K starting salary (local). That 2 and 1/2 years ago during Covid I taught this kids older sister to do maths without any of this nonsense and dare I say tears.  All that the teacher needed to teach is the two and later three (then four or more) column HTU system -it isn't hard -it certainly isn't rocket science -but banging two rocks together is far more likely to be the level of interlect of this teacher.    So TLDR whoever "British Soldier" is . yes we need a far less deferential society, probably one without the Windsors, but also without the Trade Union Ologarchs, without wankers "who served" and other wokist, socialist  human excrement, and to get back to basic values.
Tom macdonald,  5 times august,  pink Floyd Roger waters always has  about politics. Still is  white stripes is about the middle east. Many country songs .

I reading here thouse koments and lot of them here guys obout monarchy vell daun , just a lot women for this monarchy so care and i don't know y god jog man
THIS IS THE GUY WHO SPENT TIME IN A MILITARY PRISON HES A bitter bigot with an axe to grind no respect no pride and no hope.
spot on!
Maybe Nostradamus was right about his predictions concerning the Monarchs..to be continued....
Why am I seeing only 1 comment on the heading??. I'm sure they are frantically demanding youtube take this down.
I can't forget who his friend was, you don't have a friend like Saville and be innocent.  Gill Dando from BBC watchdog and Princess Diana was good friends and  was both murdered within A month over that story
VOTE FOR THE HERITAGE PARTY.........DAVID KURTEN He is also looking for candidates to stand in the local Elections.
What's a bitter angry little man I'm sure everything would change after Jeremy Corbyn is President😅
Totally agree my friend - I am a republican and can't stand these dysfunctional  perverts and freeloaders - sooner they are gone the better - hope it will be in my lifetime at 65 I can only wait and see. Enjoyed your video thank you!
And don't forget that number 1 son, Billy the Kid will have an investiture as the all new Prince of Wales, also at cost to the tax payer, "Viva La Revolution".
This must be the worst post ever
No polite way of saying this they are full of **** a disgusting embarrassing disgrace to the country they allegedly head of .. you hit on the head gangsters vile of the vile how the plebes buy into this state sponsored crock of propaganda BS… now where’s my little Union Jack to wave at the screen
Well spoken human .
The politicians are worse, they have their snouts in the trough with expenses while saving their wages!!! House of lords even worse.
The monarchs are parasites,one and all. Working people are in poverty and he pays NO inheritance tax on the 500 million he got last year. Get rid of the lot of them.
I know what your saying but nurses and doctors are on far more money than me, I have a mortgage and clean spit, urine, sick in a school and not on half of what they are, cleaners were forgotten by news, royals  etc during covid, we risked our lives cleaning up after keyworkers kids, all charles is bothered about is environment but flys everywhere, and migrants, well open your many palaces and put them in there
There's corruption everywhere, not just the Monarch, whoever is in charge is corrupt anyway, in other words we have to get rid of the Government too then as they are all dodgy, you just said yourself Charles has met dictators all around the world, a pattern is forming here, why are there so many dictators? they are all dictators with even the Land of the Free America, the biggest dictators going! who do we put in charge then? power corrupts no matter who you and where you are from so it's a bit of a pointless argument getting rid of Royals because whoever you replace them with they will be just as bad...probably worse.  As the famous saying goes...You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.  Power corrupts eventually.
100 mil for Coronation + 9 mil for Queens funeral, Seems unjust funds spent considering the times 🤔
Real leaders charge out at the front line of the  battle field. British so called royals are pathetic cowards hiding behind their throne.
As an American, I can't believe RF are still relevant  But they aren't. They own major shares in those "tabloids" and media outlets of every variety known. The orders are to KEEP them relevant by telling stories about how wonderful two adulterous m******** conquered all to victoriously attain mediocrity, indifference, and irrelevance. Camilla so generously loaded up some of the Paddington bears in a Rolls, no less, to take to a donation party for stuffed bears after queen died. What fortitude and selfless generosity in the face of economic destitution of the common subject (person). Also Britain, you have a real problem with your military being loyal to criminal organization instead of your country. Don't envy America, we're being run by a criminal organization with a delusional white guy as front man too.😮
Agreed. Next on the list abolish religious instititions.
Unfortunately you couldn't just put them in a council house as suggested simply because there are no council houses. They were given to people from countries 4-5000 miles away, Somalia Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria etc... because of the hateful & destructive policies of the (talmudic jews & freemasons) royals, bankers & politicians building their new world order.
Much here that is very worthy of being got out into wider awareness. I'd say this. The "Windsors" are not merely ceremonial monarchy or even arms salesmen - thought hey do do that. They do retain (behind the veil Joe Glenton speaks of) vast power. Just read the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 or the Coronavirus Act 2020 (and extensions thereof). They'll make you mouth go dry when you understand what they say, quite aside of power to prorogue etc. However, what really needs understanding is just how extensively they and their network of associates - vassals, really - extend throughout the corridors of government elected and employed, throughout business and (this is the big one) throughout the European construct. They are, after all, family with the very families who "formerly" ran much of continental Europe. Their aristocratic henchmen have also married well into the rising industrialist and financial families down the years, meshing them into the web. Through those familial connections, a huge web has been created, literally over centuries. It can be found manifesting in stupidly named but far from innocuous bodies like the Order of the Golden Fleece, the worlds most senior order of chivalry, headed by Karl von Habsburg, with the head of the Bourbon (Prince Louis, Count of Anjou) and now Charles in 2nd and 3rd places respectively. That may seem like so much ceremonial flummary to most people, but they take it extraordinarily seriously. KvH is the lineal heir to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire (1st Reich), Prince Louis to the throne of France. the Bourbon website is https://www.legitimite.fr - they want that throne back. So what? Well, when you see the apparatus of the wholly undemocratic  EU riddled with their historic underlings, people who owe their wealth and position to those families, it suddenly looks a lot different. Like nothing ever really changed, just that the real power got moved behind the curtain. Ursula Von der Leyen is a perfect example. Von, in German, is like "de" in French - a marker of noble attainment, in her case 18th century under the Habsburgs. Klaus Schwab (founder, World Economic Forum aka "Davos") is descended of the Dukes of Swabia and is the senior male of that line. Who is Charles great buddies with? Klaus. Who was an original member of the WEF? Charles. What organisation is currently re-writing the world, boasting having infiltrated the government of all the main countries? WEF. And so it goes on. Charles is absolutely not my king. I've written plenty about this on Zero Choice News, but what I've put above should be enough to get anyone interested in following the threads and joining the up well on their way. The world is not as we were taught.
We'd be a republic, yes, but so what? Just another republic, like all the rest. Nothing gained. Not one bit of difference to everyday people.
Not entirely wrong
Agree totally one SS with a 36 Barrett M82 and its over think about it .
I agree whole heartedly with this man
Very very well said. 👏👏👏They and their zionist buddies are why i wont live there....sadly their slimy tenticles reach most counties.
Kings, queen's, president's, if you vote for gangster's, don't be surprised if they rob you.
100 per cent agree with you mate. The royals bring in money for themselves. A republic is the only way forward. Down with this so called royal line.
The younger generation are generally disinterested in the antics of monarchy, a system which has been largely supported by the over 50's. This has now changed following their abandonment of "the people" to the excesses of unfettered government power, precisely what the monarchy was supposed to protect us from. In addition, "king" Charles has shown himself to be more aligned with "The big end" of out-of-town and country, than with his subjects. Charles 111 is more like Charles 1.
Brainwashing starts in the womb, it existes only because it is supported. Stay ewise and awake. Kind regards
What unsubstantiated rubbish!
But who else would we rely on to represent Great Britain in this crazy world that we live in .. Boris Johnson ?😂
Not even related to this directly. But nothing shows exactly how disconnected the royals, and especially Charles are.  If the royals actually wanted to keep the UK monarchy going for a long while yet, they should have skipped Charles. He was unpopular, far more so than his oldest son. He is old, and his son isn’t.   Yes, the coronation has a insane cost. But I doubt people would be as angry if it wasn’t a coat that was expected to be repeated in about 5years.   There are some benefits of a constitutional monarchy. But I get why some don’t want it, that’s fine. But for those who are against monarchy in every form, I would bet that we are heading towards the second to last king of england.
The only decent royal is Meghan
Well said that man.
Fuck the monarchy. Bring on a revolution and gain a republic state. Down with the king and his family😡
CHARmLESs the unwanted, King Big Ears 3rd. An inbred German Tax Dodger. He has 111 military medals one of which is a Naval long service medal for 21yrs unblemished service and has three bars so 30/40 years service. He did five years part time.  He wants a traditional coronation with robes, jewels and horse drawn carriage but won't go with what his Great Uncle  Edward Vlll did and abdicate because he also shacked up with ol' Camel Face a divorcee.  He was best friends with some strange sick twisted people like Ted Heath, Jimmy Savile and Sir Nicolas. Churchills grandson.
I wish this guy would debate Piers Morgan
Hear Hear.
Disallowed Scottish revolution.....
👍
Well I can't say you are wrong but what is the alternative.   Someone did write a novel about the Royals put into a working class house etc. Very funny and Anne and the Queen were fine as I recall ....
Charles is a big part of the Great Reset and the inslavement of all of us
They Being thieving off the British for centuries. They wiped out the Roman Empire (The Great Britania). They came from Germanic Barbarians.
Love this. Don't forget all the stolen jewels and treasures from Africa and Asia.  But the best report I've heard on the royal terrorist ever. Thank you.
"inbred morons"🤣
Thomas Paine's book "Common Sense" was an understatement.  The  people of the United States need to indict both NGO political parties and redeclare Independence from England and NATO nations.
Americans fought a revolution to get rid of monarchy. There is no reason for the UK to hold on to an antiquated institution!
The Original Elites... 💧💦🌊✊️🌍
There's a law which gives people the right to buy property from their landlords.  The crown is exempt from this law.  The duchies own huge amounts of land across the country and anyone who builds property on crown lands can not claim ownership of the land itself.  This means that they have to pay ground rent on a property they own to the crown, and worse yet, any privately owned property on crown lands is inherited by the crown when the owner dies, bypassing their next of kin.  This equates to somewhere in the ballpark of 300 million a year in untaxed income, taken from the pockets of UK citizens.
It's ok...he's handing us over to WEF anyway. If you think it was bad under the RF, prepare for what's next.
Leave the King alone!
You were obviously a failure as a soldier,
I'd make that big palace into a huge immigrant hotel and that other big house of nonsense with the big clock tower  a pile of rubble with the liars still in it 😡😠
Yes revolution, but crook leaders can come in any form.  Look at Biden and dictators in Canada and France.  Communism you own nothing as well. Look at the u.n. wef klaus schwabs. Look what Cromwell did to Ireland it wasn't his country.
Thank you for your service,something you can never say to the new king,they no longer have any value to this country apart for the elite to fawn over.
read the Bibel: GOD allowed them to run..."the 3+1 horses", Revel 6  It's all about US! WE have to decide whom we follow: People, who do as god, money & lie...or TRUTH...  "I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE (ETERNAL) LIFE" CHRIST☝️😇
The pinnacle of the class system. Get rid ASAP.
A soldier just a bit jealous of all the medals for bravery Charles has. Think one is for  killing grouse
Yep, they are thugs with lineage. Their name is not Windsor though. It's been Saxe-Coburg-Gotha for quite some time now. The UK ignores it has an un-elected German head of state.
All you torries! The drop stick Murphy’s wrote about this.
I can’t speak for the people of the UK but I can assure you that if the government of Canada ever allowed a referendum on the monarchy here it would be abolished in one vote.
Do you think they had a hand In Wuhan China and the Covid scam? Aren't they funders of the WHO and WEF?
The French are being controlled they have a little Emperor Macron. All world governments are working as ONE the One World Order, Climate change agendas of control. One religion, one king the beast 666.
Well said from Australia 🇦🇺
I disagree with one point, giving them a council house to live in.  What have the Royals ever done that makes them deserve a council house.  The Royals have contributed zero to this country and don't deserve to be giving anything not even a council house.
🎯 Stollen Valor on Steroids!
And what would you have people look up to....a fucking USA president.
Great video 😉👏 I find it hard to understand why anyone would 'swear allegiance' to and celebrate being mocked & oppressed by someone who took life advice from three known paedophiles - namely Mountbatten; Savile & Ball. It's beyond bizarre & messed up!!  Thanks but king charles is not for me. I'll give this one a miss. #NotMyKing
So who would you like to see as President? Jeremy Corbyn? or maybe Sadiq Khan? Maybe a woman, Dianne Abbot or perhaps Nicola Sturgeon.
Well said
Exactly!!! 👏👏👏 All so Well Said Put em in a Council house on the Dole!
Never mind the French model, the Oliver Cromwell model will work just as well
It is a mad world of different dimension with the King wearing the Royal Navy No 1 tailcoat with sword, the collar of the Order of the Garter, Order of the Thistle Sash, Order of Merit neck ribbon, Garter Star and Thistle Star, the full-size medals including the Queen’s Service Order (New Zealand), Coronation Medal, Silver Jubilee Medal, Golden Jubilee Medal, Diamond Jubilee Medal, Platinum Jubilee Medal and a Naval Long Service Good Conduct (LSGC) (three x Additional Service Bars), the Canadian Forces Decoration (three x Additional Service Bars), the New Zealand Commemorative Medal, and the New Zealand Armed Forces Award and the ultimate accolade he could receive for a person of blue blood with no particular merit, competence, or expertise. The British monarch is a grotesque institution with lots of historical baggage in its wake. The British monarchy is the relic of the past with the grandiose of God Save the King antic representing United Kingdom and the British Crown and an institution full of blood in their hands in its exploitation of the colonies all over the world. The British monarchy was central to the establishment, expansion, and maintenance of the British empire and the transatlantic slave trade. It is the pride of UK but was loathe by the rest of the Global South under the British rules. That is why colonial West historical amnesia about the rapacity of its rule in Africa is so deplorable.  If history is any guide to past events in Africa, the atrocities committed by the British on Africa is beyond comprehension.  The colonial power pillage Africa and steal their natural resources as well as forcing the natives in Africa into slavery.  Britain transported 3.1 million Africans (of whom 2.7 million arrived) to the British colonies in the Caribbean, North and South America and to other countries.  The ships then travelled across the Atlantic to the American colonies where the Africans were sold for sugar, tobacco, cotton and other produce.  The Africans were sold as slaves to work on plantations and as domestics.  There was also two-way trade between Europe and Africa, Europe and the Americas and between Africa and the Americas. The crime against humanity and atrocities committed by the British is beyond comprehension.
The communist revolutionaries would not stop with the removal of the monarchy and confiscation of their property but move on to likewise confiscate corporate assets and societal elites of their accumulated wealth. Civil war would  be the result.
King and founder of the WEF is all he will be ! Not my king !
Long Live the King
🥂 Salud. Thank you for your courage and for speaking up.  Here in America, there is so much fixation on the English royals that I'm beginning to doubt who really won the American revolutionary war.
so you want a republic see how that pans out
I totally agree with you Joe Glenton. Time for British people to change. And need to get real 👍🏻👌👏
You know the members of the royal family and all the lords and ladies, so called nobles, look down upon the little people and when they get together, they laugh about how stupid the commoners are for continuing to support the monarchy.
WE ARE LISTENING...
Jimmy Saville was one of his best mates, says it all really, judgement on another level.........
Interesting to read Nick cave defending his intention to attend the coronation.
Lol  i agree with u my friend
That's why Philip's will is sealed for ninty years , they don't want you to know what these cretins invest in. REPUBLIC NOW
i am no royalist but i don't blame him for what his ancestors did, it would be like blaming you for all the things the Army did over the centuries, question what were you in & how long did you serve? full disclosure i did 12 years in the RAF & was far from a model airman, too much gob when seeing injustice lol
Yet there's prince andrew in the falklands war saving sailors from a burning ship on film aswell.. Real walter mitty aye?, real talk?
After the Queen i was done with it
I’ve never ever been a monarchist, as I just find elitism disgusting as is the history of the royal family. When you research how the Royal family achieved their wealth and realise just how rich they truly are, you can’t help but feel angry and disgusted.
Let us not confuse charles I with charlesIII
👏👏👍👍
I love my country Britain as a proud British Muslim but the elites have taken over are country and using us the people and are beautiful country by enriching themselves just look at the food look how there a product for the rich and then there's a chemical full of poison products for us average folk they are dividing society we are going to suffer if these politicians and there rich friends stay in power they will make are life's hell
I didn't vote for Him.
❤❤❤❤
Don't forget the layers of Lords and Ladies!!
Parasites of the worst kind
Absolutely right.   They are rubbish      Aussie Bob
If i were to put my life on the line, id sooner die for king and country rrather than a dictator like Trump the dump
Ffs m8 tell them like it is😂
I was indifferent and now I’m republican
My English cousins said they began to hate the monarchy  the moment they learned of WW1 in school. "for king and Country". A whole generation of boys lost because of another man's greed
He can have his palaces ,his castles ,his royal estates ,his flaeet of gas guzzlers his aircraft train all his his horses and all his kings men .But when being platformed at a dry wank earth summit don't tell me how to live my fuckiin life by telling me how to leave less of a carbon footprint when I cycle practically everywhere 😡
You are a disgrace to the uniform that you once wore.  You are a left wing republican who feels sorrow for himself.
The Hypocritical tone-deafness is sickingly palpable on the Welfare Unroyals! However, nothing will change, unless the citizens stand together and demand better!
Question ,where did the monarchy get all the land they claim to own ,and the sea shore   ????
Yeah don't get this royal family thing across the water. Purpose? Course here in USA we have a Tyranny with criminal Biden family. Alas, they will fall. God won a long time ago.
The king took 28 million a year from Cornwall and when ask by Cornwall to please spend it here he replied no , legal racketeers
Perfect explanation, and it's true, agree agree... Well done you sir! Hope YouTube does not remove this !
What experience makes u think they are scum. I hear a lot of how air from you. What's ur proof they are terrible?
Those who grovel to the monarchy need to take along look at themselves an see where their self respect is.
let's try to be good patriots this weekend - help a foodbank, check on elderly neighbours, donate time/money to local kids groups, donate to homeless charities/shelters, not grovel to a family of shirkers, thieves, adulterers, murderers, incestuous backstabbing perverts!! We are the real Great in Britain, not a cheating old entitled git who once had a man that brushed his teeth for him.

Where's Cromwell when you need him......
Mason's that need to go
Also all that gold etc needs to be given to the people to help the poor etc.
he doesn't look that fat, suspect his "grubby fat fingers" may be the sign of some sort of illness? It does look odd I must agree. ( _"What disease causes fat fingers?

Nailed it. The queen signed away our sovereignty to what was then called the 'Common market' a name given to deceive the nation of what it really was... The EU, a New governance, a Dictatorship, a one-world order, She knew what it was to become... So did her sons one opened their Organisation and spoke about it, including their Son's, as shown by the association with  Jacinda Ardern and Australia prim-minister all N.W.O figureheads. Traitors to democracy, the Constitution and our sovereignty.
what a load of rubbish you need to be locked up for spreading this crap
I'll never forget 30th January 1649 when they put my family in slavery and massacred many then lied about our true identity. 🧕🏾🇬🇧 Jacobite Survivor happy to see the downfall of this wicked kingdom 🙌🏾
Great that someone says the truth. Unbelievable that people still fall for these thiefs !!
Its  not the Monarchy, its the tory government who has to administer properly
Seriously.
Why don't they start with giving back India all the gold and jewels they stole silver ancient artifacts time to get stolen art back to its original land
Why don't we distribute the £100m to all the adults in the UK instead? I could do with an extra £3. 😂
I’m so fed up with the Royal propaganda machine aka the modern UK media who use them as a meal ticket.  This axis of evil, the monarchy, the establishment and the media are completely self serving but their power lies in their ability to pull the wool over the eyes of the hard working people of this Country.  So sound the trumpets, put on the glad rags, get out the gilded carriage and toss a few coins to the peasants because its business as usual.  When it come to the monarchy, we are being radicalised and I for one refuse to be trained to live with my eyes closed.
God Save the King!
It was bs when I was a kid in the sixties.  Taken a while - half a century plus - but it's good to know that I'm not alone in feeling this way.  Thanks for a nice big dose of fresh air.
The Royal bloodline claim the divine right going back to the Ben Ben Stone, the ancient story of El  nominating one family to be Steward. the blue blood are said to be Rhesus negative, all of em. Some stories are accepted , some are not. Some are inconvenient , some are incompatible with our taught world view
Very clickbait. . I don’t have strong feelings either way about the monarchy. Wish people would channel their energies more constructively for change. For example, Billions have been wasted on Covid PPE contracts , billions on HS2, and millions on grants to Stonewall etc for indoctrination of children on Gender Ideology
The late Queen did pay Tax,but i doubt The King will ever pay tax.
Now Charlie wants every citizen to swear alkiegence to him. Too bad his old buddy Jimmy Saville isn't here to see him be crowned. Though i'm sure he saw him in many other 'situations'.
Bravo👌
Hey i got my self the full collection of shameless and black addr and call midwife lol i plan to spend my weekend watching these full seasons weekend
Amen to that!
Adrenchrome stored in his fingers!
I'm with you 100%
Brilliant, play it all over london on the s...s..w day
Excellent video. Seen this guy speak a few times now and he's always on the mark. These "royals" are just mobsters, dressed up and sat nice and cushy at the top of the pyramid. Look at any gangsters and they all come from the same predatory origins. And we should all be against that. Huge respect for this veteran and thanks to DDN for giving him a platform. Hope this is shared far and wide - surely enough people are clued up to how wrong the whole thing is. Even if people don't know the nastier details and the history that isn't taught in schools, it looks wrong on the surface. But people should definitely check out The Levellers! What a legend this guy is. I'd never heard of the armed force he spoke about, so even more to learn about!
There is a reason why the inner circle is called the firm, you are spot on in your video here. The establishment is not something I would ever have anything to do with. as far as Im concerned the royal family died when the queen did, they are just now over paid under worked puppets. The working people of the Uk have a choice food or shelter but you cant afford both.
Geezer
There’s a lot of bullshit in this video! Not articulate or well thought out arguments, just ranting lol
I'm no fan of King Charlie but this is the kind of pathetically juvenile, overly simplistic, political 'analysis' that defines the modern left. Embarrassing.
They don't half like to make us forget our own revolution. The Levelers were based. The Diggers were even more based.
You get corrupt democracies too
The sleepwalkers love the monarchy ,they will be out waving their flags on Saturday and grateful that theve been granted a day off ,pathetic  !
Personally I think Charles will lead to the end of the monarchy far too political personally not bothered one way or the other republic or monachy if uk became republic president would just take over everthing
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA OH PLEASE HAHAHAHAHA
So true. He likes his bags of cash from Qatar Politicians and everyone ignores it.
This man should shut up
This is just b0ll0x - & I am not even a Monarchist !
And then what...what do you want to have instead? President BoJo? Oh well, I'm sure you'll feel much better when that grubby little fraud is spaffing £billions up the wall! And you think that will save you money? Presidential elections every 4 or 5 years, the pomp and ceremony of an inauguration to go with it (71 years since the last coronation, probably at least another 20 before the next...much better value for money I think you'll find), and who will it be EVERY TIME, another Tory has-been failure, you'll be moaning then no doubt!? And what of Charles' good works, the causes he champions, what have YOU done apart from heckle, bleat and peddle personally offensive complete nonsense dressed up as fact? Next you'll be telling us that Charles was personally responsible for the slave trade and that "reparations should be paid" what twaddle you do talk. What have YOU done that warrants your opinion being taken seriously? Do you think that having been a member of the armed services gives you some God given right to dissemble and obsfuscate, to denounce and criticise without any thought as to the consequences of that which you propose? And just what is that exactly? And what of the oath you swore, or does that count for nothing these days? What does that make you? And what of the income generated from the tourism the royals attract, do you suppose for one minute anyone would cross an ocean to come and watch the likes of Johnson the clown feeding his ego? Not a chance. What utterly mindless drivel this video is, I've unsubscribed obvs as if I wanted half-ar*ed nonsense poured into my ears I'd tune in to GB News or the like. Is monarchy fair, no, but is it any less fair than the fact that some are born to incredible wealth and fortune (the vast majority of whom are not subject to the public scrutiny that the Royal family are subjected to) whilst others are born to poverty, no. Is it preferrable to yet another layer of toss-pot politicians lying their way to power and then abusing it - for my money - oh yes, at least I'm spared the spectacle of the likes of Boris the B*llshi**er or some other self-interested wind-bag political pygmy lording it over us yet again. As someone who considers himself of the left of centre politically I find this sort of ill-thought-through 'band-wagon jumping' utterly cringeworthy. Far from "EXPOSING" King Charles, I think you've just exposed yourself as an empty vessal, good day to you Sir.
I was born and lived most of my life in the UK for which I have a lot of affection I now live in Ireland where there is no class system "plenty of petty snobbery" but they all know where they come from and in the end, and the Irish will willingly remind them when it's needed very unceremoniously. Believe me living in any country without an ingrained class system is far healthier for individuals people and society overall. My advice to anyone is never put anyone on a pedestal especially someone who you don't really know and they don't know you even exist.
king Charles is a c u n t
Well  said buddy
The monarchy is mass brainwashing for the gullible.
Living here in the States, we are constantly reminded of our poor living conditions, unreasonable cost to live, increasing tax, political and corporate corruption, and the seemingly constant hate-fueled violence. But a crumb of comfort my family and I always tell ourselves during these hardships is, especially after Brexit, "At least we don't live in the UK..." To the people of so-called Great Britain, good luck and Godspeed...
The biggest con is the concept of a constitutional monarchy, as though it is the best possible marriage of Democracy and Privilege, used to cloak the gross iniquities of our society.    How can we be a Democratic nation when the people are considered to be subject to the crown?  No gods, no masters.
I have no faith in an indoctrinated younger generation unfortunately. The woke principles are endemic through decade's of planning by the "principalities and powers" that rule.

Stockholm syndrome
For me there was only one Royal, her majesty Queen Elizabeth II, ever since I was born 60 years ago and growing to an age of understanding, she was the only Royal I admired. Now she has gone, for me there is no more monarchy, I have zero interest in any one of them and when Charles succeeded her I made my own pledge, ‘not my King’ and I will stick to it until I die.
You say it like it is, if only the steeple could snap out of the hypnosis..
How takes his place Londons Carn
Spot on about the current situation, but the New Model Army were cultural vandals and are nothing to be admired.
Charlie boy is far too involved with Islam and the WEF  it will all go pear-shaped. 😮
British ruling class have not changed for hundreds of years. They think the same as in the past. And they are allied to the American ruling class. That's why Britain and USA have the same problems of deep inequality and gangsterism of govt. Read Thomas Paine or Charles Dickens or julian Assange  and realize they are talking about the same corrupt power structures.
people dont talk out about the monarchy enough.
لكي لانتهم بأننا كل البداوة متشددين  لانقبل بالآخرين
You forget all the MILLIONS the royal family bring in for charity and tourism. Trust me their job is awful yet they do it day in and  day out. Rather KEEP QUIET
Lady Victoria Hervey thinks that people people like Joe should be locked up! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4WhIaqZXNM  "Monarchist Wants To Lock Up Anti-Coronation Protesters!" Maximilien Robespierre, 02/May/2032.
This guy is spot on! It drives me nuts when people say how the royals bring in money to the country, it's the royal culture that brings money in, the history, the buildings. The royals are icons of greed, deceit and how desperate for a revolution this country is.
Family of pedophiles down with the corrupt crown !!!
We love the Diggers, the Levellers and above all - the New Model Army. Comrades in arms. Long live the republic.
I am always amused when royal engagements are explained as 'work'. They have a series of well appointed mansions, lodges and castles to return to and be pampered in. Charles prefers to being seen to be a strident nature lover, but he has a history of engaging in hunts as sport. The vast wealth of the Royal Family, and their failure to be taxed, is appalling and indefensible. The U.K. is mired in economic disaster and poverty, but the citizens are expected to celebrate the coronation and not question the total lack of equality in the nation. This institution is an anachronism in the 21 century.
They're all traitors. Past and present. 👈👈Lawful, legal and peaceful solution to all of it. All accountable, from top to bottom. In accordance with our Constitution.Treason act applies.
Britain needs a revolution. We had one and it was the best thing we ever did.
You all sound like James O’Brien in his element in the sixth form common room. Long. Live. The. King. x
I have this weird feeling all this Harry and Meghan drama is actually a distraction to what is really going on around the world behind the scenes to bring in Global Government....Considering members of the Royal family are a part of the WEF who are trying to bring in Global government the distraction of H&M makes sense!!
The whole concept of monarchy/divine right is a flagrant insult to humanity. The kings and nobility were no better than mobsters. How else did William the Conqueror come to rule England? How can the housing shortage be justified when a few families are rattling around on enormous estates?
The French adopted the English model. Charles Stuart in 1649, his grandmother, Mary, in 1587. Henry VIII put two of his wives to the sword. The notion that the English Revolution is ignored in the National Curriculum is patently incorrect. Look at the key stage three syllabus... however, the moot point here is that the topic is  non-statutory.
Could the king redeem himself with his subjects by having Rishi Sunak executed for sedition and infiltration?
I want too agree with the statements made, but my concern is: What or who would replace it with?....I shudder at the thought of a warmonger like "president" Tony B(liar) being "anointed"....Look at the likes of those other left wing fascist eg "blackfaced" Justin Trudeau (Canada) & that poor imitation  of Napoleon, Macron (France), coupled with the female version  of Hitler, von der Leyen (Germany)
personally, I'd like a Bill of Rights which affords the individual the right to proactively defend themselves.  I know everyone will cry, but look at all the mass shootings in America.  There are more guns in American hands than there hands, therefore the issue is not firearms but something else.  I wonder if there is a common thread?  I suspect so.
They do pay tax ? Isn’t he the king that’s slimming down the monarchy? There isn’t much we can say or do to stop them! Yet if we become a nation under a president one person whom rules and sets bills and laws that will be more significantly bad
Well said... Elizabeth was nice, and genuinely believed she was of service to the people. Didn' t think she was more than others. But Charles is very different and therewith the illustration that the head of state should not be head because of he /she is born into a certain family, yet lacks the necessary qualities...
Enjoy the Coronation everyone.
So they're a bunch of freeloading, spoilt, non-elected spongers, ONLY GOOD FOR TALKING HORSEY AND WEARING VERY, VERY STUPID HATS?? Who didn't know that?
amen
Excellent!! 👍👍👍👊👊
As someone who was born on the day the queen was crowned (June 2 1953) you would think I grew up a loyal royalist, not a bit of it, I have always been in favour of a republic, My father spent a long time in the British army and as a result was 100% loyal to the crown, hell he would stand up at home whenever the national anthem played. never understood it or those who have an almost religious worship of the royals.  The French had the right idea.
Their wealth is on millions of lives from genocide of foreign countries, biggest being india, now they are living off hard working peoples taxes, need to go
£100 MILLION for some posh bloke getting a new hat?
Well 22 million aren't going to celebrate it they have better things to do 😜
Not sure what having chubby fingers has to do with it. You lost me at that point. Cheerio
Did I get flack when Diana died and I said she is no one to me. She lived a great short life drinking and driving around with other rich people. What hit me that week was a news report of some poor bugger in Africa who died in some horrible way, thats what stuck with me through out those weeks and moths. Was told to grow up when I down played Diana.
This always amazes me, do people not know any history? These people didn't get to own everything by being good people. They got it by killing everyone who didn't want them to own everything.
I agree 100% with all the points made. Check out how the Monegassins came to power for a textbook example of what scumbags this clique of parasites is.
How Mamy human beings have died, because of this so called royal family?? Across the World, with Their Greed, disguised by terms like empire....for the Queen. Think of the first concentration camps, the Boers in South Africa, who starved in those camps. India, China ect. Parasite Psychopaths who think Themselfs superior to All.....Just Pathetic!!!
That ended whenVivienne Westwood accepted her obe
They need to be laughed out of existence. They’re absurd, as are their apologists.
One word of warning. If you become a full republic, things aren't going to change. Classicism is quite real in non-monarchies. No one sitting in the parliament is a rags to riches success story. Even worse to think of it, Charles is an open case of nepostism, while in a full republic you're convinced otherwise
Not my king. We the people need to take back this country. Join the English constitution party.
Alot of key board warriors on here, none of you will do anything lol. Have a good day all 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

A friend of mine always said, that the Royals were the original organised criminals. In history, they offered protection, to the poor, for a fee,what has changed? We are taxed now, for services and protection. I thought William would’ve made a better choice, but now Charles has instructed him to continue the WEF agenda and the climate scam.
Getting rid of them would be like asking a Columbian cartel to give up their life of crime,  they wont without putting up a fight and the royals have far more weapons at hand that escobar ever had, he didnt even have policing laws to help him.
Just because he is an ex soldier does not make his voice any more viable than any other old plonker. He is just grievous of his own lack of success . But his opinion is fun even if some truth. Poor daft bugger.
parasites
You must be joking, think we should do you for treason!
I couldn't care less about him the whole show is just embarrassing
Prince Harry grew up in a hugely privileged environment. He learnt and inherited his values from this privileged family. It is amazing how people cannot see that all the members of th rf hold the same values, it was in their up bringing. They were all brought up that way, having all the best money can buy.
Probably the most acurate description you will ever hear about this lot,unfortunetly too many people will forelock tug for generations to come.
Inbred, sell out, woke and vermin come to mind!
The video the monarchy doesn’t want you to see? I don’t think the royals give a damn about this video…
Whether you believe the British are part of the lost tribes and received the blessings, the ancient Israelites were warned what would happen when they wanted a king like other nations. These warnings have come to pass. So be it.
Evil 1s old family uk lords uk military chiefs french l m chiefs vatican z family bankers royals they are all freemasons pure evil
I am not a royalist but i do think that the late queen was a wonderful women who did care for her people and did great work for this country, however, i agree that the people of this country are kept as peasants in general, to think that this country is the 5 or 6th biggest economy in the world and to see a lot of people living on the streets, many of them ex military who have fought to defend this country and it's people is a disgrace, and now we see all of this money being spent on these illegals is just so unfair and unjust to the hard working people, we also have one of the highest pension retirement years in Europe along with one of the lowest state pensions in Europe,successive governments have a lot to answer for and for me are out of touch with the people of this country, there are too many of these politicians who come from rich parents with private schooling that have NO comprehension of how the ordinary people of this country live, we need more people from the real world to be politicians so that they can understand what our people are going through.!!!
'We have a King when poor people exist'  cry me a fucking river sunshine.  GOD SAVE THE KING, MOTHERFUCKERS!
I did admire the queen but charles no he is connected to the WEF
Sworn in as King Charles. King Charles was beheaded in the 1600s. This Charles should be King Charles III does that make him an illegitimate King?
You lost me in the first minute about teachers, doctors and daily commuters, you wouldn't and nor any anti-royalist would give a dime of their paycheck to help them out
your right there mate
What you have to ask yourself is quite simply WHAT HAVE THEY DONE FOR YOU !!!! That have better your life !!!
Disgrace we do not have a LR Day. Shame our awful deceitful Royal considers it more important to celebrate more woke topics whilst failing to rejoice St Georges day.
The pantomime season's come early this year. Never forget that Charlie boy is a globalist shill, member/attendee at the WEF and active participant in the Great Reset. He is not your friend.
Question: this is of course nonsense, even if you take the French who cut off the heads of there, lets just say elites, look where France is today, basically Bankrupt. Let’s take the Sex pistols, With god save the Queen and the fascist machine. Just look up in the dictionary what fascist actually means. Maybe you would like to look into what happening to the USA, where political fascist group, called Democrats , who trying to destroy there constitution, now look at the Fascist political group call Labour or Conservatives who are trying to destroy the British right and freedoms, by not following the vote to leave the EU, as for the future king, I would agree with some of what you say, you will have to watch out for the influence of the WEF, and the destruction of England, all in the great Global warming lies, It’s not that it should be monitored, its just using this to eventually control the population, and of course Charles is involved with both groups. After thought but even more relevant to the British way of life, More fascism at foot, just look at the 20 min city’s, these fascist are more dangerous than the Royals, these are your political choices, First start changing the things you can change you can change and see how that changes the whole situations. By the way you really need to Know what happens the the money the royal estates make and where it goes, how much is given back, and what taxes are paid.
German blood eating batenburge cake!!
I am no supporter of the Royal family, at all, but you seem very confused regarding the role of the Monarch and the role of the Government. Your attribution of the royals as "gangsters" might well have been true in Plantagenet, Tudor and Stuart times but George I was brought in by the British parliament of the time to avoid a catholic monarch, he was such a distant relative of the preceding monarchy that he was barely in line at all. He was given a very strict brief by Parliament about what he could and could not do. Any subsequent "gangsterism" is really down to our governments, elected governments mind you, since that time. I agree it looks "silly" to see royals adorned by so many medals they could not have possibly have earned but surely this is just pageantry, or even pantomime, I am surprised if anyone in the country looks on thinking they are heroes? The cost of the coronation is ridiculous given the nation's finances BUT this is a government spending decision not one of Charles. The royals do sell arms to other countries but at the behest of the government, yeah I bet they make money on the side in these and similar ventures but our government, of whatever colour, has wheeled them out to play. I also strongly suspect that when these regimental "heads" go out and chat with squaddies it is the latter who enjoy the interaction the most, I doubt it is more than a chore for the royals. Perhaps, the squaddies are similarly bored, I know I would not be interested, but I suspect there must be a large enough pool of interested squaddies so that the uninterested are not compelled to take part. For reasons that escape me there are still many people in the country who do admire the royal family, not hard to spot them. Certainly many deserving recipients of national awards are pleased to be celebrated in the pageantry of palace and ceremony - more so than they would be to receive their award from President Kinnock or President Boris-Johnson's-Dad or who ever. I don't refer to the Party awards to pay off political donors but the nurses  and lollipop men/women who have gone the extra mile to help their communities and folk like them. I don't care for the royals but I don't feel responsible for them either, we just get the next one in the queue. In a parliamentary democracy without a constitutional monarch then President Boris-Johnson's-Dad type heads of state are something of an inevitability - and be assured they will also want to play expensive dressing up games.
At least one English man is awake, why the rest of you British people are asleep, pull your fingers!!!
Interesting views. You are correct the Royal Family is simply a very successful organized crime family that has endured, but hasn’t that been the case around the world since the beginning of time? Look around the world and who rules it now? ORGANIZED CRIME SYNDICATES masquerading as popularly elected governments. Do you really think Britain would be any different if the monarchy was abolished tomorrow?  Look around the world now. Do you really think Charles is more evil than Biden, Putin, Xi Jinping, Macron, Trudeau? When these masters are gone there are thousands waiting in the wings to fight it out for those positions. Be careful what you wish for, you might just get it.
i will watch the coronation after all. i want to see if its very scottish. or just islamic filth. i am pretty sure the man is a traitor...but i dont know that we want the likes of the puritans back. they were mean and they were miseries. indeed why does ''equality'' mean a sort of grey measles making everyone look and sound exactly the same?  and we can see how the great republics of yesteryear are now corrupted  travestys..but we need to do something...
Race Traitor you swore and oath of allegiance and you soul out for a self destructive political movement.   We swore to protect the queens her successors her heir's thatas why we are a ROYAL army they have done more for this world than you ever will you should feel ashamed OATH-BRAKER
Quite right. The sooner they are gone the better. I am not having anything to do with it.
100% pure facts. Fuck the monarchy!! Go republic
Get rid of them now.
Totally agree, but nobody has the balls. Scotland is the same. Don't have them either
Get a life mate .
We are just a nation of bootlickers. Our national anthem literally has a line in it about "long may he/she REIGN OVER US".
I had an argument with my cousin about the royals many years ago and his royalist view was that the royal family attract millions of people to the UK each year and the revenue that creates makes it worthwhile having them. I asked him how many of those millions of people had met the royal family and the argument was over.
Former GB Clone guard dog for the evil 1s and all their evil puppets
There is no way you served in the British Army, more like a Traitor with a huge chip on his shoulders.
Strange see these ex squaddies like Trevor Coult and this guy that spew shit for views. My dad served for over 24 years, he wouldn't sit and bitch, he's got too much pride
My Dad was killed in 2007, he said exactly the same as you. His name was Thomas William Fellows, Billy Fellows.
If Charles was a gangster as you claim you’d have been rubbed out long ago. Britain is broke because it chose finance over industry and austerity over investment. Charles actually produced a lot of jobs and wealth for many people with his brilliant stewardship of the Duchy of Cornwall (£1bn+) and now he’s teaching his son to keep it growing. Your history and monarchy is the only thing left that people are actually interested in and it’s a bargain at £345 million per year. Maintaining the castles and trappings of royalty as state property and museums is the lion’s share of that and that would continue with or without the royal family. Throw your royal culture under the bus and you will have little left to offer the world except your Cockney accent and embarrassing public drunkenness.
Evelyn Rothschild  Coutts Bank proprietor  loved the Queens "Boutique banking".
Rishi Sunak and Charles Saxe Coburg Gotha aka Windsor are two sides of the one coin. Both amount to nothing more than mafia scum. One born into it the other back stabbed, lied and voted into it. What have either added to life what is their contribution ? Nothing they only take, like parasites. Since the dawn of written history these murderous thugs and pirates have invaded, looted, raped and pillaged their way around the globe. And for that we idolize them. We almost deserve them for not doing what the froggies did centuries ago to punish them for giving us all a bad reputation.
OH yuk!  What's with Chuckie's fingers??  revolting!!  is it a lizard thing???
Well said!  I literally had to wait until i left the UK to learn about the Levelers and the Diggers, the king we beheaded and our Great-British revolutionary history.  In fact i think i could safely positthat as a kid i learned more about those events in French school after my mum and dad brought my brother and myself over to live with our grand-parents in France than i would have done if i had continued school in the UK.  Crazy when you think about it...   Down with the Monarchy! The imperial and racist, colonial, theocratic and semi-fascistic regime that has long out-stayed it's utility and it's welcome among the British people.
Perhaps the Brits should wonder what actions are being taken by the Government while this Disney fairy tale nonsense provides a distraction....
So rail workers. Teachers , nurses won’t be waving their  flags Saturday

❤❤❤ i will never pledge allegiance to demonic spirits,
Well said. It's time for a new model army
What about us outlawing slavery? At least 1 pure page in our history? No? Btw I have no loyalty to the monarchy just our country.
You want to elect a leader?? Have you learned nothing from 'democracy'
Go back far enough in history & monarchy was founded on total aggression, killing the enemy & much slaughter. All just inherited titles. Why do people revere them. It’s all fancy dress. Meanwhile millions in the UK do all the hard work. The royals have everything done for them. They built nothing.
If having a "democratically elected" leader in place of the monarchy is the only alternative, then it is no wonder they have survived so long. The political system is corrupted and needs a complete overhaul.  Ideally, the monarchy and the house of Lords (along with all the titles inherited or bestowed) should be banished to history.
His Duchy is a well managed criminal enterprise on many complex levels.

Do you really think that a Republic would be a Utopian Wonderland?   Is there no inequality, poverty or corruption in Republics?? The French Revelation ended with the Terror! Thounds of innocent died. From that arose Napoleon who became Emporer, crowned himself and brougth 10 years of warfare into Europe.   There's a big difference between absolute and constitutional Monarchy.  Our Revolution was the Glorious Revolution 1689 when France was still an absolute Monarchy!  Its delusional to think a Republic will be some utopian wonderland.   This your opinion but not political philosophy.
The British Royal Family does a lot for the people of England and the Commonwealth, the fact that they are apolitical and can be sim pathetic to any side is very good for moral, and didn’t the king just donate personal money from his windmills to the country?

Very interesting video and very true, ime also a former British Soldier and have never had time for these Tax dodging Royals, Lord Mountbatton was Charles's mentor from when he was a young boy and he was a Paedophile, Jimmy Saville was a mate of Charles, Rolf Harris was also well connected with the Royals nuff said
Jimmy savil took kids to prince Charles to his home FACT 😢
"Is it really theft if you've taken it back from thieves?"  Love it. @7:42
Irish republican here, never knew about the English rebellion. I find that fascinating bjt not surpising. Makes me think of the United Irishmen who were inspired by the French and the Americans. What could have been if Napoleans ships of weapons had actually made it to them.
your reasons of narrative is not valid to be honest they own the land also , the french getting rid of the royal family the democratic person who guillotine them was also guillotined  yes he is in the wef and yes i do not trust the guy  but if they are a monarch what can you do about it the only way is they are German decent   you can send them back to Germany and yes they will have him for one reason e will still hold the land of England. so officially you can not get rid of him the nurses is more detail there are different types of nurses some just do beds , i am sure your social standing is also not valid both leftlabour and tory sold the businesses to the eu and america  the one what really holds the card is America politics that seem to have a hold on the country .
Amazing that a former soldier can see the reality of the veiled dictators.....
A very important and excellent piece by Double Down News. 👍
Is it any wonder why Princes and King's, Are the clowns that caper in their sawdust rings, Ordinary people that are like you and me, We're the builders of their destiny.
Too many sycophants protecting their jobs and positions. This prevents change. No one has the guts to tell the billionaire royal family they cant have any more tax payers money.
Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, a nice British-sounding family name for you.
Where did you choose to live? i'll move to this perfect country :) . Ironic that Cromwell then decides he wants to be a King, laying in state with a sceptre, Orb, Crown.....pass power on to his son...you couldn't make it up. How many royals in the last 1000 years have gone into battle for this country. Are you saying the UK should stop selling arms abroad. (is anyone else going to stop selling them) that'll put a lot more people on the poverty line.

When I saw the clip title, I was expecting something profound and well argued. Instead all I get is a diatribe of trotkiest garbage from an inarticulate yob. Former soldier !  What were you in ?..... the Pay Corps or equivalent ? You are pathetic ! GOD SAVE THE KING
Considering i have served most of my  adult life, and  seeing what your doing here, its not about you and  getting clout (from what i  see)  you never have mentioned the fact, the first people you serve for and with are the oppos  to your left and right,regardless  if youserve for the crown or not, and   from ur track recorld i dont think you have much to say, however   i do like the historical  information  you  puit in this video, buit dont orget its not the royals its the goverment, that  course most of the  problems, so  stop  blaming  them and look closer at your self and the goverment!  Sorry fella, but   a lot of of are chinstrapt  about  all this, and with the woke   and snowflake    "Take Take Take" but no one wants to give...... so ye i aggree with the walting,  but you forget the bloating.......  Mirror comes to mind fella.
Well said they are all  criminals
Speaking as a Canadian that witnessed the Queen visit my city when I was 11 or 12 years old, long time ago I can’t even remember without googling it….I can say that most Canadians could give a crap about the so called “royal” family. You are totally right about the gangster family, they totally are, and a disgrace that they’re still in “power”. The House of Hanover should be abolished, pathetic to see them in power and their family blood line doesn’t even come from the UK, they’re German decent, actually King George 1st was the one from Hanover and he didn’t even speak English, 🤬…it’s a day off for me, I’ll be sim racing on my PC while this bs coronation happens.
3 minutes in and this guy is spot on. Amazing, great video.
I always believed that i was the only person who thought they were nothing but a bunch of inbred greedy thugs. I kneel only before God, not some snooter in a big hat.
It’s war baby
They murdered Diana....
You deserve more vieq than is showing tbh. Dangerous people indeed  I like nothing about them. .  They have brainwashed the masses to k*ll to keep them in position of power.
All the new immigrants are the monarchists today. The firm is just a mafia like you said.
While I agree with a lot of what is said, and I totally get where this video is coming from, it is slightly misplaced. If the monarchy was disolved tomorrow it would make 0 difference to the lives of working class ppl. The land held by the royals would not suddenly be allocated to public use and those funds would not defacto be given to those most in need. A Robin Hood figure is not going to fly in, pick the money and assets up, and put it where it really should go. What people don't like is what the monarchy represents, and abolishing that won't change the core problem. Again, not saying not to do it, but I am saying if it was abolished tomorrow, the way things are today, nothing would change.
also an ex squaddie here! The times of monarchy are over.
I'm a proud republican and my father was SAS and tory through and through. I guess I've rebelled. When I hike around the land I come across property that's been handed to families centuries ago. They were the result of what I call simply 'Gang warfare' no different to that on the street. In came a gang, wanted power, got it and passed on the lands to its supporters. These land owners now call it private property but it was a so called public act that bestowed them it. Yeah it's our land alright dressed up in romantic stories of thievery and competition. It's brutal alright. Take care. Mark
Unsubscribed thanks to this.
I dont mind monarchy, they can be circus monkeys if they like to- being paraded around dressed up as clowns and parroting someones else's opinions, there are way more demeaning and overpaid and way less useful and even outright harmful jobs out there( IMO half of various corporate, entertainment and government jobs is in that category)- if their private income and wealth and enterprises were subject of the same laws and inheritance and other taxes and regulations like everyone elses.  they can live off the govt "handouts", wear govt owned jewels, live in their council houses a.k.a. palaces owned by crown estate, which is de facto govt controlled and owned, but their privately owned properties and all income, including the one from Lancaster and Cornwall duchies and compensation from govt for their "services" should be subject of the same laws and the same scrutiny the govt under their name imposes on us, normal mortals like there are richer ppl in UK and while I am social democrat im no bolshie so they can have their inherited money and overpaid "job", just heavily taxed and their businesses regulated under the laws they themselves signed without all the exceptions and special treatment.
Is there another episode to this? I watched it all the way through and I couldn't find the bit where the soldier EXPOSES King Charles. And this guy didn't sound anything like your average, deluded, bitter, uninformed socialist!
Meritocracy is the way forward. Get rid of the Royalty and tax the Aristocracy to penury. Over centuries they have shown no mercy. Show them none in return as you take back what is rightfully yours.
What nonsense, I am in favour of a republic but to propose putting the Royal's in council houses is just bizarre. If we were to do away with Monarchy, it would be by just stopping the funding and taking away their titles, but it would have to be done for all the titled folk. What really gets me is we allow the proletariat to vote, a great majority who have no knowledge of politics or our uncodified constitution. Be careful however because a law could be made that makes some of the bile against the Royal Family treason, they are part of the Crown, stranger things have happened in history.
My goodness you are bitter!

I am annoyed the queen said Camilla should be consort but Charles has changed that
....moan about the politicians that put you into wars. I am a new republican..... but the most evil are the Blairs of this world.
King charles member of the wef  santanic club who wants u dead basically
Right, where do I sign up.

Cromwell and I am sure many of his troops are not well liked in the East Coast of Ireland  aka   Drogheda.
We should acknowledge our past looting and raping of other countries, acknowledge our contiual exploitation of our own workers, mean it when we talk about levelling up and revisit a past little taught. Those who fought for better rights. The Anti-Corn League, Chartism, the Co-Operative movement, Trade Unionism, Women's Suffrage. That is a history to be proud of. Its a history of us, the people.
Privileged bunch of useless nobodies, strutting about in uniforms to which they are not entitled, flaunting rows of unearned medals that mummy gave them as presents. Swear allegiance to them?? Ha ha. Never.
Prince Charles is an evil man, he believes in depopulation, and anyone that believes in depopulation believes in mass murder. Simple!!!
Totally agree. This so called coronation about to take place is an affront to the current economic struggles taking place, while this Tory government attempts to suppress our right to take action in protesting and striking for better wages and conditions. The organised crime syndicate calling itself the royal family in asking for people to stand and swear allegiance to the king adds insult to injury while we pay for this obscenity of a ceremony.
Spot on bud, got yourself a new sub
It warms my heart that so many people are seeing through the charade of the monarchy.
You said it well mate . The slave masters Tricked the Slaves into serving n  worshiping them.   His mom died instead of mourning it was more important to let the public know , rest assure you still have a ruler   They don't do shite to better humanity lives.
right on, brother.   thanks for this most excellent commentary.
A book? You can write?  And where did you learn to whine like that? The REME? 😂
Hi not gone last long ... we will see...
Very well articulated...exactly my sentiments..Being a little post WW2 kid l saw the 1953 coronation not understanding what it was all about.... 70 years later and l do...Vive le Republique..
Yep time they went. We don’t need a tampon for a King.
Kevin McCloud of Grand Designs, once said in a trailer for the show, "The British sense of identity is tied to the  past".  Time to stop looking back I think. Time to create a new, forward thinking and fairer identity. Love this channel! 💛
Charles should have been vetted, and investigated before he ever had a chance to become King. And I at times wonder why was he so buddy, buddy with Jimmy Saville.
Suppose you got rid of the royals with the understanding that they are unjustly taking money. What about the countless elites that are doing the same. What about the government itself, it is funded by taxation (theft) yet not it or the other elites would be removed with the royals for stealing money via taxation.  Unless you're going to end the idea of taxation, removing the royals because they take money is a bit pointless, a drop in the ocean.
- Been reading Thomas Paine again, have you? Well cut it out, It'll only lead to trouble. PS: Well said.
The Royals are being superseded by the Rothschilds Central banking cartel. The criminal Rothschild bankers will take over the British Royalty as they have done  with all  European royalty.  Now the Queen has gone the British Royalty will pale into insignificance under Sausage figures at the hands of the bankers.
What is up with those fingers, seriously?
Abolish the monarchy.
There isn’t a nation state or any of their institutions that wasn’t founded on raw power and greed, including the British Army you are proud to have been a member of.
My team were given an award by then prince Charles, he shook my hand and smiled at me. I didn't smile back. According to the historical record and contemporary data, the royal family are puppets of the money power. Let's not get distracted. He is an open enemy of the indigenous people of these islands, that's why he is the king🕊️❤️🙏☘️
People don't love Charles as they did his mum. Queen is dead and l think the monarchy died with her. Fact that Charles and William are WEF funding members does not help. His changes to the oath made clear the disdain he has for the British People.
Time to get rid.....have a referendum
Land stolen in the past given to undeserving criminals to reap the loot for their heirs to continue stealing to their tax free benefits at the expence of the wage earners
Talks to plants. Best mates with Jimmy Savile. Complicit in his wife's MURDER.
you are a trater get lost
Hi from Australia,I hope Australia will become a republic,we had respect for the queen but not Charles,he is inbred, woke,an a creep An Australia is still used as a massive money laundering front for the bank of England an the political entity the city of london our reserve bank is still owned by the bank of England,we in Australia still pay 11cents of our tax dollar to the monarchy an Commonwealth fund England is the biggest owner of land in Australia after china actually it owns more,England gets 200 billion in iron ore deposit profits from Australia a year  An has removed 3 of our prime minister's  Curtin got poisoned  Holt got killed  Whitlam got removed  All removed or killed by England an America to stop us becoming a republic an nationalising our mineral resources or using nuclear energy
All True. Royalty are corrupt because they see themselves superior to others, its the biggest kind of description.
LOL only 26% of you colonists wanted to abolish the monarchy. You guys are a bunch of peasants.
The monarchy should be disbanded and their money should go back to the people. They all should have to work to earn their money like the rest of us, if they can't cope, tough.
Absolutely correct !! Thank you for telling the truth
Ii don't believe in hereditory rights. I don't believe in the bloodlines creating better than the rest of us. On the contrary it is well known that inbreeding leads to a weaker species. Great to see someone (you) with the guts to come out and say it as it is. Well done.
Great that the notion of putting 'em in Council flats is catching on. Good enough for the rest of us, innit?
The same channel that's constantly calling the government a tyrannical bunch of corrupt thieves now wants an elected head of state? Yeah, okay.. I'm all for huge reforms to land ownership and opening up our countryside but you can have that and keep the monarchy in a slimmed-down role while preserving the continuation of history going back a thousand years.
The government are the real gangsters British government is increasingly being ran by dual citizens of Muslim faith, bearing in mind this is a Christian country , there’s more than just the royal family wrong with this country the whole island is corrupt. From another fellow soldier which counts for nothing btw, we are the idiots that worked for these people for ridiculously low wages I wouldn’t say it like it’s something to be proud of
They're actually criminals, drug smuggling, people smuggling. Resource stealing, paedophilia, the list is endless they are the worst example of British society.  The Worst.
An elected head of state? No chance - we are all too stupid and self-serving to manage that. Look who we already elect to run the country?!
I was somewhat surprised when Charles said the population should swear allegiance during his coronation! I  swore allegiance to the Queen, her heirs, and successors when I signed up,  to expect the population of Britain to do this sort of smacks of reverting to feudal times. What next? The monarch's right to sleep with the bride on her wedding night? But, facts should be checked before being claimed. According to a "Memorandum of Understanding on Royal Taxation" published on 5 February 1993 and amended in 1996, 2009 and 2013, the Monarch pays 100% tax and all profits from the Crown Estate is paid to the treasury. The government covers Royal expenses at about 15% of the Crown Estate revenue which works out to about £1.80 per citizen per year.
The country would be rich again  if we got rid of the royal family😮
I also think the UK as a 'political entity' is on borrowed time. It's going to break up within the next 20 years - despite what all the fanatical royalists, brexit headbangers, and JRM/Boris Johnson fanboys say.   Ironically, this process has been helped along by us leaving the EU. Just as London will no longer be Europe's no. 1 financial centre by 2030. At the rate we're going, it won't be the second largest financial centre in Europe either.   I see the rest of this decade, along with the 2030's as ushering in profound and radical change - led by the younger generations.   The decline of the monarchy; the decline in the UK's influence in the world (to go with its already zero influence  in Europe); the toppling of the Tories - with an end to their crushing domination and toxic policies (through younger generations bringing an end to both the FPTP voting system, and Hereditary Peers....and voting en masse to remove the Tories); the decline of London - both as a major financial centre, and  as a livable city; a less subservient and more clued up electorate; and the death of newspapers by 2050..... because few if any people currently under 25 read them. And won't start to as they get older.   The 2030's is shaping up to be the most seismic decade in Britain's history. It could aksoy see the end of the UK as we know it. The signs are all out there at the moment. You just have to know where to look. But in time they'll become more visible, as an increasingly vociferous and demanding younger generation force through change.   They don't want the UK that exists in 2023, and I have to say I don't blame them;  because the country as it stands just isn't working for anyone under 35.
He is the Antichrist and is a big player in destroying humanity.
Ok you might not be able to say it, but I sure as shit will... When it comes to the royals we should follow in France's footsteps... and anybody who argues the royals bring in money, the palace of versailles makes way more than buck house ever will
Bravo brave Sir! You are a true freedom fighting soilder protecting what little rights/social freedoms us the 99% against the elite 1%!
Excellent to hear some truths from ex ilitary man
You are 1 million percent right.    I've never understood why we have to bow down to these inbred morons or why they would be better than us.
They are immigrant family living in biggest council house in country and all on benefits .
The thought of replacing them by a president like Tony Blair is also frightening. In France they have Macron who is a tyrant.
Well said. The royals have stood, arms folded and indifferent to the struggles of their 'subjects', while greedily taking our taxes. They only have one goal, which is to preserve the monarchy.
An elected head of state can be as problematic as any sovereign head of state, take Donald Trump for example or even Adolf Hitler who elected himself head of state! But at least an elected head of state is voted on every few years.  We need to hold people like politicians and the media accountable for their behaviour, including lies and corruption an election ever four years isn’t good enough. We have seen the most corrupt government and media in living memory and they seem to be able to keep going with impunity.
Not exactly objective.  Everyone is entitled to their views, I guess.
what a frauad  they are to our country and the world
So true 😱
He just needs to keep his nose out of politics. That is the law.  He should make an oath to the people to serve with charity and visits to see the real life in this country.  But will he…..?
Thank you DDN, I agree completely with your view on the monarchy. The easiest way to ensure the end of the inheritance of privilege is to ensure they cannot reproduce.
The Crown, the City of London, Rome. It's all one connected, seedy, web of evil.   Are we expected to believe the Queen didn't know about Andrew/Epstein, and wasn't briefed by her own security services? Or with Charlies and Saville? And the whole WEF reset, which Charles openly champions, which is a threat to democracy and the country itself?   It doesn't add up. All the shiny jewels in the world can't blind the man with eyes to see.
khazarin mafia? why does king look like lord Rothschild? same 'family'?

I'll say it again, this week, the UK government is spending 100 Million Pounds of tax payers money to put a crown on an old farts head
king of woke. wef
Okay leftie, I guess we'll ignore the hundreds of non-military companies that benefitted from marketing their goods on the back of Royal Visits. We'll also ignore the £Billions they bring in via tourism, unless of course you think the tourists come to see the lefty god Sadiq Khan!
The RF is greedy and corrupt to the core. Selling titles for cash, committing crimes and getting away with it. Inherited power and influence is truly abhorrent, see North Korea.
The whole country needs to see this.
I've been arguing these points for decades with monarchists but they tend to get very angry at you.
S P O T  on.........
WOW, this is my first view of this other opinion.  I am from the USA.  I will try to wrap my mind around this other side, will consider this new information.  Although my opinion does not matter, I have visited the UK more than a dozen times, and I love the people I have met. Taking the Grands and children to Scotland this summer, the admiration for your county and the wonderful people I have met, will continue.  The US is also in a terrible state right now, so I see the dilemma our allies across the pond are witnessing.
Charles visited my workplace in the 80s i chose to take the day off as i have never believed in Monarchy thousands was spent to bring brand new equipment onto the site for the one day of his visit so as not to offend his  eyes with the rusted equipment we used on a daily basis, all the new equipment was taken away after his visit lol
So we're going to ignore their actual military service because they're also hold honourary ranks in other regiments? Pretty disingenuous.  You also admit they financially benefit the country, serve it (apparently white collar jobs aren't jobs to this man), and help Britain as a whole extent soft-power and political influence.  I'd far rather we spent such luxury on SYMBOLIC heads of state, rather than inflate egos of politicians. There is a wonderful symbolism in keeping a vestigial monarchy, de-clawed, and powerless. Whereas you seem to worship the French model of democracy which was both horrifically bloody and resulting in far greater tyranny. Read more history man.  Oh and we're meant to ignore that you advocate beheading people because they were born wealthy. What kind of vile morality is that?
This is a cheap shot!
The irony of a former British soldier. Convinced to pick up a weapon, do whatever he’s told, even when it’s wrong and made an oath to the very people he criticises. Jezzo 😂
Thanks for this!  I’ve been a republican for over 50 years, ever since I spent 7 years living in Paris in the 1970s.  Shared to Twitter. ❤️👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
There were 3 main armies in the English Civil wars. You mention all 3 yet state that there were only 2 armies – why? The armies were Parliament, King & Levellers.   The Levellers, as you say, represented the common people.  We lost.   Did it make any difference that Parliament beat the Crown & beheaded the King in 1649? Parliament were the landowners, the ones who meted out the day-to-day atrocities under Monarchy so did people see any difference in their lived experience? Probably not. Did the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660 make any difference? Maybe a little, maybe a slight improvement but probably not for most.  You also fail to note the big Constitutional change, the Bill of Rights of 1688, the settlement that handed essentially all power to Parliament. Monarchs do what they are told, meet who they are told to meet where & when they are told to meet them. Monarchs are tools of Parliament. If you have beef with the way the country is run blame Parliament, they're the ones doing it.   We lost. No levelling happened.   Parliament won but with acknowledgement that they needed the Crown.
You lost a credibility at "chubby little fingers"
Why do some people think that working class people are just morally better?
Socialism is all about despising the rich not helping the poor.
I find it hard to disagree with you. Time for the parasites to stop being a burden on society and get a real job.
Christ,I wish more people would have the guts to come out and say things like this! Why do people stand for hours in the pouring rain just to watch some stuffed shirt,spoiled poufter riding by giving everybody barely a glance? This coronation will be a joke.Look who's invited to attend! Celebrities!? Assholes with probably less sense than the Star! People impoverished still look up to this disgusting example of inequality and injustice. Grow up,folks,get yourselves a country and a nation you can be proud of. This present situation is a betrayal of everything you have worked and lived for. You are being led into hell.
Thank you
It is taught now had a conversation with my step daughter last month about it.
You can not be taken seriously when you critique the Royal Family's friendship with Arab Regimes while ignoring The Royal Family's friendship with the Apartheid State of Israel.
Love this , they're parasites end of
Impressive and so right. Thanks, Joe Glenton.
I’m not a royalist but that is utter cobblers
We should never lose track of the soft power the Royals enjoy. They help in boosting the UK´s economy through tourism and selling British products. We should forget the holier than thou attitude. The Royals play a huge role in international diplomacy. Does anyone know the name of the President of Germany?  Thought not.  The UK is still a democracy and I can imagine that if a clear majority of its citizens are in favour of deposing the Royals, it will happen.
I think all the Duchies and Grosvenor Estates should be confiscated and a 1st president be elected.
They will never act as the final check and balance. Tony Blair never got challenged by them after the house of lords did nothing and got filled with replacements, therefore no constitutional monarchy so it is all an illusion.
The windsor royal are just an off branch of the house of gotha saxe coburg. I live in Northern Ireland. People here are brainwashed when it comes to royalty. Nobody ever mentions their germanic past. Even prince Philip had uncles who were decorated SS officers. We saw the photo of Philip as young man walking with his uncles at a NAZI rally. I have never believed in monarchy. I have never idolised anyone or anything. I always wonder what makes people tick that have to idolise in any shape or form ? Royalty princess and prince king and queen is for fairytale’s . What is wrong with these people. Is it a mental illness ? Or a bad gene pool just like the royals ?
Social parasites and disease are how I see "Royalty".  Outdated garbage.
Brilliant.. Why become a soldier and not support the Royal Family? Yes, I get what is being said and can't disagree. But not coming from a soldier.
We have to ask ourselves, though, who funded the English revolution?  There was a vast New Model Army to pay, to feed, to provide weapons and uniforms for etc.? The clue to this riddle is what was made legal after the parliamentary victory?  It was never a peoples' revolution...they never are!!
They are not Winsor but germon
I bet there's gonna people that will actually cry because they THINK the Kings gonna care for them 🤣🤣🤣
Their reptilians.  Evil to the core.
I think you'll find he got himself into power by being born. What a load of nonsense this is.
We maybe about to see the monarchy start to fall now that the only one giving them any relevance is no longer with us.
"Huuuuge tracts of land."
Can we eat the carriage after , can we heat our homes with all the  bunting no ,, he makes me sick pay for this yourself you have more than enough of our money to do so ,,
Scotland needs to become an independent country and a republic
Yes I agree
I guess you won't be swearing allegiance to the king then.
Spot on .
Hear, hear!
I wish to shake your hand !! Expose the ORDER OF THE GARTER - BLACK NOBILITY - Criminal murdering parasites - Not even the Windsors - German Kharzarian Mafia -  They have a secret Island - St. Helena - Check that place out. You will find Princess Diana here, and many more. Do you know why they and many more don't pay tax? Because - When you know the tax law - You will know it is ONLY bases on VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION. Same as NATIONAL INSURANCE - Voluntary Contribution. I don't pay a penny into this corrupt system - Why? I cannot under god's law, common law - FUND CRIMES AGIANST HUMANITY. Makes me PART OF IT.  What does LAW mean - LAND - AIR - WATER What does WAR mean - WAGE AGAINST REVOLT  Problem - We are surrounded by servile myopic carcasses that need culling, along with the Kharzarian Mafia alike.
The Queen was the last great leader
Spot on. I have a particular dislike of Charles. He's a huge supporter of the WEF and therefore does NOT work for the average British citizen
It’s also the pinnacle of the privilege, power and possession that if you’re born into and dutifully suck up appropriately to, you’re in. Sloan rangers and chinless wonders get wed to titles and privilege while more and more subjects\citizens are using food banks so they can maybe pay their exorbitant rent and bills.  It would take a quantum shift to change it. Since leaving the EU we’ve been propelled back to a surreal 1950s mentality accompanied by echoes of a faded empire, GBN, Farage Mogg, to name but a few trying to create a nostalgic reality that has long gone. On Saturday we shall witness something akin to a vampires ball.  I do hope for better for my homeland.
excellent vid
Well said totally agree
As a saxon, we've not had a true king since 1066.
Yes Brits you need a revolution.
Th only King I bow down to is Christ Jesus. The monarchy is toast
I understood Buckingham Palace Is a council house ?
The real Royal Family :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SG4Ec9nEwwk
The royals and all their multitude of hangers on are a waste of space and nothing more than a bunch of leeches
The Crown Estate auctioned the seabed around UK for windfarms. The subsequent billions the monarchy recieves will be paid for via our electric bills.Redistribution of wealth from the poorest to the richest.
Some absolute, half-brained, nonsense here.
Oh my goodness you speak so many truths.  It’s something I’ve felt for years.   We do a really good line in hypocrisy 👍
I sincerely appreciate this video. I have to shut off during this period of Coronation.   I just can't take the mass delusion. Which probably isn't really that large, but the press amplify it to maintain the status quo and fill pages on a quiet time for news.  Appreciated. And thanks for your service 👊🇬🇧
There was a time that you could argue we needed a monarchy . Those days have passed . In the modern world they are SNLR
Remind me, when did Chuck get his paratroopers wings?
We've got our own Trumps-in-waiting....
If he was a real king he would not work the people of this country as hard as they do. In medieval times the workers didn’t work as hard and where looked after because they knew how important we where to them. Now they just import for less. Well that won’t last forever as they will run out of people to enslave by wages.
Thank you for your service and having the balls to talk about this 👏
I really couldn't have put it better.
5 mins in and this dingbat is just waffling, thought I was clicking on a video that would have some substance to it lmao.
I've been a royalist all my life but when Charles aligned himself with the WEF it's all over for me and would be for everyone but of course it wasn't a public message so most people have no clue
Queens are for bees kings are for poker
Where are the artists? slowthai for one.
Have you seen- the real royal family- by tony Robinson, our real royal family are alive and well living in Australia.
KATG "Scrap the Monarchy" is the only protest song I know of at the moment. Make it no. 1.
many countries have royals but they dont do coronations any more for obvious reasons
👍🏻❤️👍🏻
1000 people own all the land in England but 300 people own all the land in Scotland it’s scandalous
Thank You 👍🏾❤ Charles is just Evil man 🙈like Camilla 🙈
Let's look at this from a different angle. British democracy is under threat as never before. Republicans are being threatened with arrest just because of their opinions. I attribute this to the deteriorating emotional intelligence of the British and people elsewhere. How can we recover the emotional maturity of the general public so that we can recover democracy?
Medal's Charles??? :)
clickbait title
Dump the Nephilim hybrids
Some people are just born to be 🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑 I guess. !!!??!?
brilliantly argued.
Wow, this guy sounds like he hates the monarchy almost as much as I do 👍
❤
The most boring criminal gang in the land
They're all reptilian paedos
John Lydden is a monachist now..bellend.
A former British soldier whis had an epiphany moment and can now see reality . The royal family are vile and disgusting people who will one day reap the wrath of the British people , that's if the government doesn't do it first . For all of you who are struggling out there take solace in knowing that in the state of New York one of the biggest landlords is crown estates which belongs to Charlie .
Leave the King's trousers alone!
ya and they all parade around with their ceremonial wings and medals
Nice to hear them referred to with their correct titles. Don Jug Ears has none of my allegiance, that goes to my family, community and country!
the artists who mock power are probably still around but they will never be given a platform in the 100% elite controlled media world we live in today
not my Royals
Well said brother
Great insights into the monarchy. Most are fed up of the whole debacle, but do we really have a choice? People in power are always hungry for more and would do whatever it takes to keep it.  I will not be watching!!
God save the King
Ed Gray    Royals need reminding they Serve at OUR Pleasure THE Sovereign PEOPLE of the United Kingdom , They're Meant to Swear an OATH OF Allegiance To Serve  US.
Tradition is an excuse to keep lazy thinkers in line; the Monarchy is by far the best example of this.
Hard to understand why people would choose to serfdom over their own sovereignty.
What a revolting mental image, KINK Charles being exposed xD  Great video DDN, keep spreading the truth and dismissing the lies!
The worst part of contemporary monarchy discourse is knowing we'll have to go through the whole thing again when Saville's sausage boi pops his crown clogs in a few years' time, although I suppose The Queue™*did* prove that dead monarchs make for more popular tourist attractions than living ones.
Time to stop this MAFIA GANG they've only helped themselves and nobody else
Exceptional
Charles is a woke fool and the coronation must be boycotted OPENLY.
Excellent but "this country" is England not the UK.  Does the rest of us.matter ,?
DESERTER.
Learn about Henry VIII, you're joking,  he was a vicious bastard whose vanity and greed cost thousands of lives, horrible, horrible deaths for ordinary people. There's never been a 'good' monarch.
I recently learned that the queen, as was, now Charles...own the seabed, and collected 3.1 billion in rents for the windmills...Charles kicked back 1 billion to government, but kept the rest.  the mind boggles.
Met most of the royals.... was not impressed at all.... same with most polititions.... total waste of oxygen.... not one brain cell between them... and the only interest they had was self interest....
I'm sort of glad my dad passed away in 2020 so he does not have to see the state of country, he gave his heart for.  My dad was send to Burma and got malaria,which damaged his heart in the 70's and was medical discharged from the 17th/21st Lancers, he was a tank driver and my hero.   Life over Profit, Love over Hate....❤
Believe  me l have worked  with many veterans ,and  people of Britain  should take off their  ROSETINTED GLASSES WHEN IT COMES TO THE ROYAL  FAMILY
I'm most definitely NOT a monarchist, but I do worry about getting an elected head of state......... There is too much power in the right wing media at the moment. We could end up with something much worse than we already have. Maybe it's better the devil we know, for the time being at least.
The had diana killed.
To be fair, it was their ancestors who were vicious gangsters who took over the land in battle, the modern royals have just inherited their positions and power and would a Presidency be more honourable or cost less? Has anyone done a cost/benefit analysis on that?  I'm no supporter of the royals but which is an admirable Presidential model? Perhaps New Zealand, or Ireland, but the nature of Presidency changes from President to President. I suppose one benefit of a Presidency is that it lacks the sense of entitlement of royalty and Presidents can be voted out.
👏
Their wealth is literally coming from the blood and tears of others who suffered under their rule.  Yet these people are literally put on a pedestal as if there were worthy of respect. Sick society.
TOTALLY AGREE 100%
Nice one
What a wonderful dream but we need to get some decent politicians as well otherwise we are going to get one set of rich people for another
Well said great video
A king of any credibility would immediately release Julian Assange from belmarsh maximum security prison.
what did charles do to get all those medals pinned on him hes never been in the army or the navy
Just another wannabe who thinks he knows better than everyone else. Anyone who disagrees with him is in his own words "a bumbling peasant". The royals don't bother me either way but people like this do. If people like this were in power the majority really would be slaves. Or executed for expressing a different opinion.
Have you learned nothing from Brexit? Stop trying to change the status quo without a plan.
The original stream of consciousness before bandits shat in it.  Bravo.
French model sounds good.
I mean Really : With  Jimmy Savile as his closest bestest buddy . Wants to be a Tampax . I mean  Really ?
How I wish someone would play the Sex Pistols 'God Save the Queen/King' anthem on loud speakers at the coronation! 😂😂
Totally agree, the monarchy is an anachronism and has no place in modern day Britain.
Nailed it!
NOT MY KING AND NOT IN MY NAME
"To many of you, for instance, the World War (ww2) was a supreme disaster, an agony to be averted in the future at any cost, a dire and dreadful happening indicative of the wickedness of man and the incredible blind indifference of God . To us, on the inner side, the World War was in the nature of a major surgical operation made in an effort to save the patient's life. A violent streptococcic germ and infection had menaced the life of humanity (speaking in symbols) and an operation was made in order to prolong opportunity and save life, not to save the form . This operation was largely successful . The germ, to be sure, is not eradicated and makes its presence felt in infected areas in the body of humanity . "  from 'education of the new age'1954ABailey. Her 'trust' are consultants to those nations at the top.
Feudalism never ended because it worked so well for the top half a percent of the population.
The filth of the royal family is astounding.
hold it there private. nobody promised anyone a free marxist lunch. nobody asked single mothers to sleep with chads, and nobody asked chads to mess around at school. all the bleating for more government money just means other workers having to pay for more handouts to the feckless. perhaps its time for the working class to take themselves more seriously ? and as for the homeless men on blankets in the high streets. if you can hold out a hand for money, you can use the same hand to pick fruit right ?
new model army were also a great band
He's not my king!😑
I will never swear allegiance to KC he is not my king.
B S 😡 its politicians that need your venom, that have caused all these issues  you are ranting about not the Royals.
1000's % agree.
I couldn’t agree more. Thanks for the truth sir.
Mais, oui. ❤❤❤
Yet every time we spend money or post letters we have to look at their smarmy greedy faces. Makes me sick when I see so much poverty in our country yet greed and power in one single family.
He is an " big as.....)" with many dirty things he is " hiding" !
100% gutter 👑
Well said. Hope this disingenuous institution does not last.
figured this out when i was around 12. it don't take a genius to figure out the system is rigged against us. it's all divide and conquer.
I’ve never understood the popularity of the royals.
Chubby little fingers 😂😂😂 you did Charlie wrong fam 😂😂😂
Any republicans are free to leave the country 😐
King's & Queen's, who Blind your Eyes and Steal your Dreams.
No mate people are not preparing for the coronation, we're putting up with it. We're accepting it. Its our greatest soft power asset and a buffer against a Donald Trump. To say you served is a disgrace.
Corona  👑
he can sod off!
Nice1 guys
