Not the LDS🤣🤣🤣
A reminder that Cody Rhodes knows full well what he's talking about in this promo-he was the executive VP in AEW.
🔥
Cody Rhodes don't cuss ❤
🔥
Cody Rhodes you will finish the story
Cody Rhodes you will finish the story
5:56
He cooked the rock with this promo 😂😂😂😂
11:33 the homelander part
lol lds little d*** syndrome   i almost died when cody said that
No Fr Cody Rhodes Roasted The Rock And Roman Reigns 💀
Do you think she should stop making jewelry for me my babysitter it’s unnecessary just unnecessary. I got to learn to not ask for a lot from her just appreciate the friendship 💜
That’s the thing with my babysitter she got in a abusive relationsh so  still recovering from it my babysitter so that’s are deal I didn’t think men should cook and do laundry  because women are fragile men should cook and do laundry for women 💜 women are very fragile precious people women 💜
Is nobody gonna mention how he mentioned Homelander in this promo. 11:30 .Ngl Homelander Cody Rhodes wouldn’t be a bad idea
Rip Scott hall
His speech has gotten so much better. Good for Cody
T
Cody Cody, don't you? I didn't believe Em. Cody, yeah, be here alone. Yeah, you're coming in this car load. You'll come in here coming the building along Cody. Do not believe the f****** line m*********** Kohli kohli Kohli. Don't believe the lion son of a b**** and don't believe that a** wipe right there. Cody, don't you dare take Cody. Don't you dare believe I asked m*********** Oh my God, don't believe him Cody. Dear God don't believe him.  Oh my God, Cody, please. Good God don't believe him Cody. Don't believe in Cody, don't believe them. Don't believe him, make sure you have backed up because that lie and m*********** elite from day one he's been lying.  When he first started, he was fighting on his own.Daddy had out, then he had babysitters.That's what reigns I didn't say, daddy.The a****** Roman Rangers jerk.I like to say a lot more but I have respect for him.Cause he's right now.He's going through a rough time in his life.I understand but it doesn't want to ship
He word is not the. Truth
Tooth fairies
The ROCK DRESSED LIKE A T 8:55 OUTH  Berries
ThE  ROCK
What about  the toothfarie that he played  in that movie
We need Black Suit Cody more
Rated r
6:54
i love his little lisp
Full Homelander?  God, that would be absolutely beautiful.  Cody and Homelander are both American Nightmares.
I havent watched WWE since 2008. But with The Game at the "helm" im all eyes 👀.... pun intended
This is what The Rock does. He elevates people and brings them to his level. He did it in The Attitude Era as well as he's doing it now. Couple that with Cody mastering the art of the promo knowing how to be engaging and talk to the people instead of at them to get their interest, this all equals promo gold. Cody is old school trained to think in pro wrestling and can do something no one else can do which is cut a promo on any adversary and make them sound interesting. It's nice again to have the feeling that I need to tune in every week to see what happens next. That is what pro wrestling is supposed to do.
The Rock is a heel with dog $hit on it
Ohhhh if you smell was the American Nightmare was cooking that night, it was a good Rocky Roast 😂🤣💀
Literally I knew he was gonna say that 1:25 before he even said it 😂  But these two right there 3:22 5:58 6:48 should be MEMES 🤣🤣🤣🤣!
I hope Cody win the title, cause it would so obvious if the title stays in blood line the story need to change to long with the same rutinen the only difference that the rock is coming out of nowhere and look like he runs the show even when he wasn't around I guess he trying to get people back after what happened on Hawaii and he's moved with Oprah but some people forgot to fast really sad and am he's fan but didn't know that side from him.,
He said Roman will fall
The Rock and Cody are definitely cooking something together..🤔
Finger poke or doom? Does Cody act and Hogan and poke Rock’s (Nash’s) chest and pin him?!?
WWE has life again!! Thank you Rock!!! These sorry azz superstars better feed off his greatness because he’s not this generous.😂
Cody is a legend, from New Japan, aew and WWE. The final boss will be conquered!!!!!
F Bloodline
PAUL RIDE THE WALRUS
Nobody believes you cody your mid
The rock is saving the show cody rhodes is horrible wont be able to carry the show
The rock don’t know Latino moms. They ain’t scared of anything
Seems like they are trying to get it back to the attitude era again. Or as close to it as the network will allow.
Paul E is gonna turn on Roman at WrestleMania
A tag match…. Snore
That suit is Cody’s symbiote suit. Absolute menace and mad lad 😂
Hold up a second. I need to know the story about Mrs Runnels beating up the UC.
Cody is a hater
Fox would have muted him for 3 minutes for saying that.
The fact that Paul Hayman is still playing the role that he began with and his career i 8:03 n WCW is remarkable.RESPECT He is a modern day Bobby Heenan.
WWE is on fire right now! Great wrestling TV!
It’s crazy The Rock is a small part owner of WWE
Cody's father face is on full display here
You can't tell me that Cody doesn't look identical to Vergil from the dmc reboot
WE ARE SO BACKKKK I LOVE ALL YOU GUYS IT FEELS SO GOOD TO HAVE WRESTLING AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN AGAIN
I got a feeling the Rock and the bloodline probably will show up on Smackdown tonight because Cody Rodes will go face to face with Romen tonight on Smackdown I hope Cody Rodes brings backup.
As much as I’m a fan of Roman reigns I’m also a Cody Rhodes fan and tbh reigns needs to drop the title for fact he doesn’t really have to do much now he’s second behind hogan to be longest reigning champ Cody needs to win finish the story Cody haven’t won any major titles in wwe as Cody is now better than he was back then
I bet rock will come and attack Cody
I feel like making a Rhodes dynasty movie would be cool, but actual movie, with Cody as the main narrator when the scenes dont have dialogue, and Gold Dust chiming in every now in character, it’d be gold
The bloodline are all cowards
lets go Cody. So happy to see WWE good again
I hope the rock and reigns get whipped and I know that the rock and reigns can’t do anything without solo and jimmy, Paul, because they are scared.
Yes yea Cody you sold out for fn aew. And  now your back. Last year you thought you were going to win at WrestleMania same as this year . Rock and Roman Will when then the next night you can finish your story. After rock helps you beat Roman then I,m not watching wwe anymore.   Ha
Bruh…that was no regular paul heyman…that was the brock lesnars paul heyman from 2020
I noticed the Rock decides to come back to wrestling when Hollywood is falling apart.
The resurgence of the Attitude Era in these segments are so spectacular. It's time for change in how they show content.
The moment Cody started mentioning 'saving WWE' I half expected him to take a dig at Dwayne 'saving' the DCEU 😂😂
Tony Kahn must be kicking himself for letting Cody go.
This is why I've always been a fan of Cody Rhodes
Don't trust Paul Heyman. Roman Reigns can't win by himself. The blood line always sticks they're noses in it
Cody is a terrible actor !!
I've always RESPECTED CODY'S CONFIDENCE
It's got personal
Itll be nice to see Cody go full homelander as champion, like an out of control champion with so much power, then slowly turn him heel
Can’t believe stardust made it 😂
He should have said... My brother GOLD DUST was a heel!!
Cody Rhodes is garbage. Boring 😪😪😪😪😪😪
Cody is so great on the mic
I think cody hathz a lithp
Cody did noting but COOK on the promo
i feel like it should be jey in that tag match instead of seth. thats just me tho🤷🏽‍♂️
I want to see what is next on Friday.  Bloodline run-in. Count on it.
This feud starting to feel like Cody versus the rock for the WWE universal championship. The rock turned Roman reigns into an afterthought.
Everytime I see "Rock haters" it just doesn't make sense to me because statistically his promos bring in more views than Cody's. Folks just need to appreciate greatness.
We all know Roman is going over on Smackdown. Why are they even having that match. I don't think a title has ever changed hands right before something like WM between the same 2 main eventing WM so it's a wasted match.
WWERAW WWEManger Benjamin Parent Hearing Deaf Talk you Wrestling 👍 0:22
8:04 “I WANT AN APAWLOGY”😂
Paul Heyman is the greatest voice of WWE LOL
Love the uncensored promo
9:30 - 9:55 small little snippet, but amazing delivery from Paul. Almost joker esque. Dude deserves his HOF ballot.
Paul really needs a intro music
Good promo. But Cody…. You have lost every real match. Your hair doesn’t change that you are a jobber
Cody boring rock better than Cody
...hmm, exposed Gerwertz.  Or Gewirtz, or whatever his name is.
LET HIM COOK!
When Cody said the homelander comment I fell to the floor 😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Finally a little "attitude" bleeding through
Still not sold on tough guy cody
There's definitely some of his dad in his promos.
We all know how this going to end. I'm thinking Cody better have Seth on standby I'm just saying
It's hard for Cody to compete with The Rock and Roman but I will give Cody his props because he won't back down..he's hungry..he's really good and I feel at WM he's gonna be right there ready to go..
2:22 immediately pans to the most quiet boring neatly organized crowd ever.
Gloves are off for this 😂😂
Cody getting his getback on the set is what i like 👍🏽👏🏽 these back n forth promos internet/WWE are something we havent seen in a decade
No body else on today’s current roster to go at the Rock like Cody has been going. He killed it on the mic this week.
Cody killed it 🔥
The term "universal" is stupid should just be wwe champion the universal championship was a joke.
Bobby Heenan is the Goat. Doesn't anyone remember?
It would be dope if Cody brother come and help him
Please Cody, my carrot can only get so erect
I just want to know why The Rock went to Epstein Island? Why he is so buddy buddy with Oprah? Why he bought so much wwe stock & sucked up to the TKO board cuz Hollywood is on strike. I've got many questiions...
Love that Heyman gets his HOF spot, especially thinking about guys like Bruce Prichard who would make fun of his 'cheap, ill-fitting suits' and laugh at him and jabber in creative meetings like 40-year old frat boys, making fun of him behind his back to Vince endlessly. Bruce isn't smiling now that Vince is gone, I'm sure. Can't wait for the doc on how slimy that guy's history with WWE is.
How do you not, as Cody, bring up the fact that Rock is about as durable and breakable in the ring at his age as CM Punk is? Love the Brian Gewirtz line.
Cody has too much visible make up
Well we know Paul lying cause they said Rock booked for Smackdown all the way into Wrestlemania😂😅💯
Remember when wrestling shows were filled with wrestling & not 20 minute speeches...
Cody, one advice, never ever hurt a fan feelings or heart, you going to finish your story no matter how long it's takes, you got this, this from my heart, Lesa  M
11:21 😆😆😆
I cant take Cody serious with that lisp. 😂
Bad deal. Don’t trust them.
YES SIR! UNCENSORED AND LOUD
Dang, I don't even know if that's PG!
Brock lesnar is gonna be Cody’s guardian angel
Black suit Cody is good for business
Ashley!!  look at Cody!!
😲Yoooooooooo....LDS!!! 😆😆😆😆😆 WWE, no longer PG....this is great!!!
Yep, i think the rating changed.
Bald homie tweaking at 7:27 🤣
WWE fans want Trump 2024
buddy has a lisp
This kinda gives me 'The Authority' story line vibes
I’m all for Cody finishing his story, but I wish he’d get a little more fire on the mic in terms of his delivery. It’s not so much what you say, but how you say it. I don’t care if his promos are written for him. It’s up to him to cause us to believe they’re not. I don’t feel that from him just yet🤔
Tony Khan must be sick
So Cody is going to be a Paul Heyman guy what a twist.
Set up
Hopefully, Jimmy ❤️ returns to manage The Monster Amongst Men (💀) & The Nigerian Giant (🖐🏿) as a  Tag Team! Also, Pretty Deadly (😍😍)..........
Cody has to win the belt at Wrestlemania! It’s his time! We need an American Title run!!!!
PG era is slowly dying! About time!
I don’t even know if that’s PG! -R-Truth
Use me as a keep swearing/cursing in wresting & PG is wack button
🧐🧐 it's on.
i can relate with Codys mom story, My Ma would throw down in her day too :)
Hes not going to be alone. 100% guarantee it.
Great promo.
HHH and his crew saved WWE. Hands down.
Yo he COOKED The Rock 😂😂😂😂
Yo Cody is goated 😂😂
We had the Attitude Era, Ruthless Aggression, and the horrid PG Era.  We calling this the Renaissance Era? The Return to Prominence? Suggestions welcome!
That was a really good promo, was he reading a teleprompter or is Cody that good?
Oh he knows the out come of the Match the writtes already have it done
if Paul is going to wear that suit, he'd better have some peanuts and hotdogs to sell.
This is why I stopped going to wrestling events to much talking
I have to say I kinda hate how much of a cuck they have turned paul heyman into
I have a LDC
Do you smell what Cody rhoads is cooking
" I know your mom" and his face expression had me in tears lol.
Cody Rhodes is on fire!!!!!!!!!
Cody is so trash idk why y’all like him so much guy is mids
I don’t know if the rock is a terrible salesman
Cody said all that to say nothing lol
Cody is getting attacked back stage by the rock and the bloodline.
When Cody pulls up in a black suit, run 😂
Cody is just simply getting better and better on the mic. Been waiting a long time to see this.
Cody really showed a side of himself he needed to show here. He is ready now
Black suit Cody is nuts
Someone of the faces these guys make to portray anger is laughable. Love the brow, lip snarl and flicker myself
Here is just a thought.  This whole heal face thing here, everybody, for the last couple of years, have been teased, taunted, and made to wait for the eventual Rock vs. Roman match.  Everybody assumed it would be The Rock as the "face" of the match.  Maybe he won't be.  Rock is a member of the board.  WWE might play this as the Rock becoming "a new Vince McMahon."  Roman has built a fan base at this point that, let's be real here, and I'm not bashing any other storyline when you watched for the last few years, you wanted to see The Bloodline segment.  On RAW of course, RIP Windham Rotunda, it was the only story they had there, ant technically could have played in somehow to Roman's story if you look at how Roman's current story started.  This might end up being kind of a face turn for Roman Reigns.  Just a thought.
Usually they censor the YouTube too , RAW is backk ….
"Kudos to Brian Gewirtz for that nickname" is the most inside baseball line I've ever heard, laced into a promo that started with breaking down a commonly used inside baseball term. Brilliant callback.
Gotta give it up to Paul. He's one of the greatest heels and promo speakers on the mic. Without him Brock wouldn't be Brock and Roman wouldn't be Roman although Roman who? He was the weakest one in the shield in my opinion.
I love he spoke like his dad
The rock has lds why was this not talked about
Certain tones that Cody uses sound like Dusty coming through
It's stupid it's crazy.
Rock has LDS signs will be popping up soon.
Attitude era promo from Cody genius.
Paul Heyman The Rock think he owns everything I got to ask you something Paul Heyman is the rock Putin if the rock think he is Putin besides taking out United States take out Canada if you think you're Putin
Lisp.
Honestly cody you are very blunt ❤
Paul Heyman is a legend in his own right. This is one of the best promos I've seen in years 😅
LDS > Diarrhea Dwayne
The how and the why WWE has kept the weasel Paul Heyman employed all these years boggles my mind.
This clap back is not as the same caliber as the Great One.
Cody come back was Weak! 👎🏾 he still sounds like he crying
Cody does not convince me as a major star to beat Roman sorry aint buying it
Never thought cody vs roman rock vs roman would turn into the rock vs cody
Do you smell what>>> Cody Is Cooking?
WWE has it up and Downs with vince out things are getting better we just need more cinematics
Cody told creative I will write my own promo 😂😂😂 seeing how bad y'all did Seth
Ps i smell paul leaving the bloodline and turning heel
Ik paul laughing at all this before he comes out ps rock is now forever known as roman side chick
Paul just gets it. Saying the "RAW audience" instead of the "WWE universe" is 10x more resonating. I can't explain why but it is.
I don't know if thats PG?! 😂
I thought heels was what Brandi Rhodes launched for AEW that flopped lol
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This wrestlemania is going to be awesome
Bruh Paul hayman got best manager
YOOOOOOOO😂😂😂😂😂😂😂LDS IM DEAD
Cody will never fill the shoes of the American Dream he is absolutely no Dusty Rhodes and old Paul is worse than old Jim Cornett himself Paul is no hall of famour he is a leach that hasn't done nothing for wrestlers sides use them for their money while riding out on the backs of their names and the WWE died with the attitude era OF RAW IS WAR WAR IS RAW and has been shiite every since and VINCE hasn't been able to do anything with the company since besides take a big shiite on it
He may show up alone but the rest will show up together I hope Cody doesn’t fall for that
Cody sounds like his father in some words he pronounces and when he gets loud, talks much clearer but definitely Dusty son....
5:58
Paul heyman should use his mental theme during his entrances
This is the wrestling we need. This promo, and interaction between Rhodes and Heyman was just great.
While we're distracted with all this WrestleMania heat let's not forget about senior Money in the Bank
Cody as Homelander 🔥🔥
personally i say tds lmao
The Strong Language will be limited and Rare...even on Netflix. And I don"t think there will be any F-Bombs (thank god!).   Also, to the Dumbasses,Stop badmouthing PG, there is nothing wrong with PG Wrestling. It works great if done right. A Great Example would be WCW thoughout Most of it's existence.
how long are wwe episodes now?  keep thinking of the south park episode on "wrastling"  w.t.f
Ok so what’s the catch of showing up alone?
At 5:57  Booker T: Tell me he did not just say that.
Rock come to Milwaukee!!!!
So is the attitude era 2.0 coming back or not 😢
Sounds like a trap .
Ehh yall kinda overhyped this lol it was good but nothing memorable. He breaks the 4th wall(which everyone likes to do ever since cm punk 2011) and says curse words
WWE knows what uncensored can do for the business !
LDS was a great comment.
Cody wont be alone lol we all know this a set up hope jey and rolling show up
I think Friday is when the fighting in this feud starts , feel like they are going to beat Cody badly and we won’t see him until mania
This better not have any fake fan noise
If Cody's fans are the Cody cry babies then the rocks fans are now to be known as rock suckers.
We are entering a soft reboot into an attitude era light. It won't be everything the attitude era had... But I think we're going to get enough of everything we want to make most people happy
Why has pro wrestling turned into crying and whining about every little thing? That’s why I left the arena. Take a Xanax and STFU!
I bet Brock Lesnar makes his return at Wrestlemania
Anyone Getting Offended By Both Sides Is Getting Too Much Into This 🤠
Cody Rhodes coming back to WWE was the best thing to happen him and The rock and TKO bringing back Tv14
The Rock is 💯 attacking Cody on Friday which will create tension between Roman and Rock, since The Rock went against Romans word.
Cody continues to draw attention to how promos have changed, starting with the chicken nuggets. The Rock's one-liner style is outdated.
He still can't do a good promo
Can’t wait for snoozemania to be over
I love cody❤😊😊
WWE is such a joke
It’s either Seth turns on Cody or the rock turn on Roman
Lmao Paul Heyman makes all this better ☠️☠️☠️
So star dust the mark finally cuts a half way decent promo! 😂 good job kid. The Rock had to bring it out of ya
I didn’t think about this and it’s something I don’t see happening but what if , just what if Brock or cm punk shows up at wrestlemania and backs someone up that’s a far fetch for a what if , but thinking about all of the possibilities on night two , this is one of ten that would make sense in a way.
The Rock just elevated wwe to whole new level
Dont trust PH cody... He might out a gun and off you
Have anyone knows Paul heyman character remind of Crowley on supernatural 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
7:26 A Cody Rhodes Shirt Acknowledging ROMAN REIGNS IS CRAZZZYYYY
Paul heyman the next hall of fame so acknowledge him
To hear Cody use the business term “heel” shows how “meta” this upcoming Wrestlemania is gonna be!
Cody was like attitude era
Sound mixing is atrocious, but the promo is good.
Could anyone else see a special guest referee for Cody Vs Roman? I could see Stone Cold calling her down the middle and making sure the bloodline doesn't mess around
is wwe pg-14 again????????
well with all that being said it’s safe to say so long to the family friendly PG era as we usher in towards a new attitude era!!!
I wonder which non-bloodline member will show up on Smackdown to help out Roman best Rhodes?
And on Friday night Smackdown we re enter…..The Beast Incarnate
no more pg era practicing for when they get to netflix lol
Oh i Can't Wait 😂😂😂😂
"if the rock is the final boss then call me the final Link" don't forget Cody loves Zelda
I DON’T THINK THAT WAS PG 🤔
Just listened to busted open radio with dave and bully ray they was saying it lack passion and was not great..i enjoyed it was find cody did good to me
He’s good on the mic but the LDS line was cringe
“There will not be a single other bloodline member in sight”   “Roman will show up alone”  Jey USO interferes and helps Roman win, OR a big surprise with Brock returning and interferes.
Finally stopped crying 😂 Now we can get entertained Rock was killing em for weeks
This should be titled: Cody Rhodes ends the PG Era in one promo 😂
Best Road to WM in years. Rock and Cody killing it week after week
Never noticed Cody has a lisp
Everybody saying this was Cody’s best promo yet needs to chill. He’s not even close to matching the Rocks promos at this moment, and Cody is great on the mic. The Rock is overshadowing all of the top talent right now. They should be grateful that The Rock isn’t 20-25 years younger. He would’ve definitely had the run they forced on fans with Roman except without the force. All in all this is still one the defining moments in pro wrestling we are witnessing. Can’t wait for the documentary about this situation with WrestleMania 40 a few years from now
DON'T YOU EEEEEW ME
You can not trust Paul he's a lier
Get him Cody baby
It's about time!
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I tried to watch Raw last night.. It was horrible. Weird tag team names everything looked super fake!! Awful. I could write better entertainment than WWE writers
I dont know about the rest of you but I liked this version of Cody!! Sounds like some RUTHLESS AGGRESSION found its way in lol
This felt like Elite Cody. I love it
lol at those geeks on the entrance way ramp... not the kids. the grown adults marking out
LDS was banging
Jim Cornette needs to be crying about him saying HEEL
This dude is an idiot. Who is this guy?
Why is Cody trying to be LA knight? This doesnt sound like Cody at all. Sounds like he ripped a page from LA Knight.
wait... how is stardust the top guy in wwf?
Oh snap. Wasn’t Cody was supposed to be the nice guy? The Bloodline really got Cody to crack.
Paul got a lowkey nice entrance
Cody proud of his violent mom 😂
I think the injury angle with Cody Rhodes is about to happen, I been seeing stories about it for awhile now. I think they may go with it
Cody was on fire, let’s goooo!! WM!!
Wwe misleading title
It’s a new Era!!
It would be awesome id golddust could back up cody
The fake crowd noise is soooooooooo obviois 😂😂😂😂
That camera angle at 1:08 looks amazing, we are living in a wrestling renaissance just by merit of the little things
Paul heyman is the goat
5:44 i’m sorry but the way he says “the  BELL is gunna ring”💀💀
Roman reigns:”I showed up alone…but I didn’t come…alone”
Corny
Can't believe he got away with saying l.d.s lol😂😂😂 that was unexpected
Notice they said no bloodline on Smackdown in the 1 on 1 meet up between Roman & Cody. Cody with no back up. Roman with no Bloodline. However I believe someone else or other people other than the Bloodline may attack Cody.
'Terrible salesman?  Dwayne'the Rock' Johnson?!  They're going to give this insufferable bore the title?
Rhodes dropped his nuts and shown Dwayne "LDS" Johnson what a roast is
One of the best promos I've ever heard.
Wwe cookin with the new camera angles
THAT was a badass promo from Cody! This feud is gonna go down as one of the greatest ever!
Can’t wait to see Rock squash this grape
Bro, paul is going to wind up like dominick Mysterio and not letting paul talk one thing. He's lucky that paul can still talk
This is a breath of fresh air for Cody, I felt all of his promo’s recently have been relatively the same.
We getting the attitude Era back boys
This Cody boy likes men.
WM not about Roman
ITS STILL A TRAP
If this is where WWE is right now and sticking to it from now on, I might start watching this again.
This is the best he had? Pathetic lol! Cody is boring and overrated but “hE hAs tO fINisH tHe sToRy”
Sal Bandini! Wanna wrestle?
They just gave some power back to Cody via Heyman. I love it. It seems like a balanced feud involving a dominant champion, as much as we hate to admit it.
LDS 😂😂😂
The rock is probably gonna go back in the ring and do even more trash talking 😂
"They're booing you and I'm about to go full Homelander..." Welp. It's official now. 🖤☠🤍
About freaking time Cody! Rock has run rough shot over Cody and Seth, but I like Cody's fire here! Thank God he didn't say Diarrhea Dwayne.
12:09 💨😀
Paul even scortched cody here
The fake crowd noise is killing me
Ngl, that black suit on Cody is 🔥
The crazy house.....the dream aew will NEVER achieve......without nostalgia or in America.
Big Dusty is proud of his boy today! Kinda wish he would have added something like, 'You ever see pictures of my dad busted open. Who do you think sewed him up half the time!
*system* Bullet Club Cody has joined the chat.
This is what is really going to get The Rock to turn on Roman at Mania. Friday night The Rock will show up and Roman will be mad because The Rock went against the Tribal chief. Then at night one of Mania they will lose the tag match because The Rock will  try to "prove he's not Roman's side chick." This will really make Roman mad and he will tell The Rock that he "better fix this." Then during Cody and Roman's match the ref will get knocked out. Out comes The Rock...he stares down Cody (looking as if he's going to cause him the title), the announce team is freaking out saying this isn't Bloodline Rules. Then as Roman starts moving in for what looks like a 2 on 1 beat down Rock delivers the Rock bottom to Roman and leaves. Cody then does a trifecta of Cross Roads and pins Roman 1, 2, 3. Setting up Rock vs. Roman at either Summerslam or Wrestlemania next year.
Y’all keep forgetting randy is smack down 😂
Cody is so boring.
No cussing in WWE! Lol they might fine you Cody. That's too mature rated
I Am A Cody CryBaby 🙌🏾🙌🏾 and Proud of it!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾LDS Dwayne 😂😂😆😆🤣🤣
Actually Cody, The Rock is making wwe interesting to watch rn.
DAMIEN PRIEST AND JUDGEMENT GOING TO WINS THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP FROM THE ROMAN MATCH TO WHERE JUDGEMENT DAY HOLD ALL THE TITLES THATS THE STORY ITS CLEAR AS SAY PRIEST THE ONLY ONE WITH THE BRIEF CASE JUST WATCH.
bro brought out aew cody
Cody channeling The Hurricane
What a liar
That homelander phrase was perfect.
You would think it's Dwayne vs Cody for the belt at WrestleMania. WWE is making Roman look irrelevant 🙄
Haha paul with the phone. 😂
Grayson Waller attacks Cody this Friday? Cool nice little tune up match
This guy is 100% unlikable.
paul heymans word..no bloodline at this fridays smackdown...ITS A TRAP!!!
Rock had to come vet Cody and make sure he was ready 😂 if Cody can keep doing this then we good
Thank you crowd for no “what” chants
Official prediction Paul Heyman turns face at Wrestlemania
Should have roasted Rock for getting gassed walking down to the ring.

Excellent promo one of the better ones I've heard in a very long time... nWo 4 LIFE
Heyman be puttin’ on, with tha energy and those suits 🔥👏🏾
Here’s the catch, they are gonna give heyman a gun on smackdown
Uncensored Moment
Joe Anoa'i (Roman Reigns) is not a heel. He is a mahu and wears heels.
funny how cody getting so live in the ring without anyone in it
Okey So MJF is going to be in WM
Dude is such a loser, horrible actor  its so dumb they are setting him up to be champ
Should've been cody vs rock 1on1 at wrestlemania 40 the build up between the 2 makes roman feel like an afterthought and irrelevant since rock returned
OLE STARDUST
LDS LDS LDS
Paul Giamatti should play Paul Heyman in his biopic.
This isn’t PG wrestling WWE!!! It might hurt your bottom line! 🤣
Don't let black Twitter get a hold of this 😂😂 LDS going viral
Cody brought over the whole “breaking the 4th wall” from AEW.  WWE had been missing something “real” before Cody.
This is getting embarrassing. They have these two out there slapping each other like girls, trying to go "Attitude Era" in these forced, unnatural promos that are just exposing how out of touch Cody and the Rock have become.   Stop already, WWE. Just stop. You're wheeling in 50+ year old has-beens to headline your marquee events and repeating the same exact matches as the year before. Not to mention they're trying to completely copy AEW with these profanity-laced promos they've all of a sudden adopted. It feels incredibly fake and unnatural. JUST STOP ALREADY.
Yall dont see to understand Fox has always censored their programming lmfao Rocky cry babies
Those ‘cheers’ sounds so A.i and fake to me….
so some "mysterious" characters going to show up then, huh
Lol low key cody Rhodes is not winning at wrestlemania 😂😂😂😂
Cody be cutting them promos boy
This is the Cody we needed, someone that just absolutely goes ham on a legend and he deserved it after talkin about him and his momma and threatening his family. Yea Cody needs that Homelander treatment
Lds
I swear Cody needs his own clothing line of luxury sets like what he comes out with call it Rhodes Or CODY made by Cody or Rise or Something like that
He talked about the people’s strudel 😮😮😮
Wwe is so bad how do yall watch trash
He didn't cry this time?
Is the Attitude back in WWE? Sure seems like it.
I did show up alone. They showed up on their own.
I hope that Cody has Golddust watching his back at Wrestlemania 40!
Happy Birthday Paul Heyman and  many many more! The greatest wrestling manager of all time!
Cody moms need to be arrested for battery on a LEO!
This by far was Cody's best promo ever!!! I am 100% ready for this wrestlemania!!!!
RIP the PG Era, let's goo boysssssss
He's scared lol
Roman somewhere punching the air like Seth saying “Hey guys I’m here too”! 😤😭
I really like this new era of actually showing Paul Heyman the respect he deserves even in kayfabe. It's actually super nice seeing people treat him like the legend he has always been.
Idk how Heyman has not gone into acting he would do great in crime movies or DC’s Penguin
Haha you referenced the Rock/Hurricane backstage segment
I feel like I'm watching a child try and convince me they are tough. Acknowledge the Tribal Chief ☝️
They trying to compete with AEW on the promos
7:26 bald dude in the crowd was TWEAKING bro 😭🙏
The pop when dog pins Roman and wins the belt is gonna be earth shattering
This was AWESOME
Even if the bloodline gets banned from ringside one of the relatives in NXT is gonna interfere. Like solo appeared the one time.
Deaaaal!
The rock is a momma's boy. The rock saying that to Cody, was like dude "that's you too". The rocks a moron
you Now men I don't know if that's pg 😂
🇺🇸💀🔥🎤
i dont think this is PG 😂😱
This is a dark side of Cody Rhodes you could tell by his black suit
Professional wrestling is for adults nothing about this sport is PG
If not for Rock and Roman, Cody is so uninteresting.  It’s set up for him to win at WM and after that, he doesn’t have the chops to carry it.  So boring.
Promo was good but the piping in of the fake audience makes it sound trashy
As the legendary Rick Flare use to say WOOOOOOOOOO
Cody is so embarrassingly boring. Notice how they have to pump in crowd noise for his rants. They never do that for the rock.
No one is better than Paul !
Rocks segment got 2 million views where as this is at 700k…
I am done LDS. I am done.😂
What should we call this era Modern seems so basic
LDS! LDS! LDS!
All for Cody to lose again. Cody’s going to get his reign eventually. But now is not the time. We need Roman to remain champion to change history.
I think Cody should have brought up the fact that The Rocks dad Rocky Johnson had 6 other kids while married to the Rocks mom and The Rock wants nothing to do with them. '
Well it’s official. Cody is losing to Roman again.
Cody stood on business tonight
This was ok but the rocks prom was better by far
Anyone catch that long one shot going into the backstage? When Heyman comes out and stands on the apron, I also noticed the improved quality of the production. Better lighting and composition and shot selection.
Cody better have his guys in crowd
Come on Cody! You know Roman can't win a 1:1 match with you! Hayman is 1000% gonna interfere 😂😂
Paul is the GOAT
Cody out here COOKIN.
If he beats Roman he will be thee lamest champion besides Roman😂
Ladies and gentlemen, WRESTLING IS BACK!!!!! Feel like this is the 90s again
Cody’s becoming bullet club Cody!! YES PLEASE
That Cody promo was fire 🔥.
cody is boring and these suits are wack
I Love how Heyman still has a phone in his hand.  Throw Back to Paul E. Dangerously
What a b**** Cody, he's the guy that beat Roman reigns. Sad to see what happened to WWE
I love how Paul Heyman is the wrestling version of Saul Goodman
You start talking Momma's it's on Rock
I love the turn wwe has had in the last 2 and half years. Cody was a great addition. The talent is flowing. The bloodline storyline but look at Seth and your intercontinental champion.... They are creating legends . We don't think of cerebral assassins, we speak of the architect. We talk about the American nightmare. We speak of wrecking everyone and leaving . I'm feeling ucey right now . We are in the platinum era . Look at the women. Look at the women in wrestling, I'll say it twice. I appreciate this generation of ladies so much cause they beautiful and throw down and main event just as well as the men . We might be in the most evolved era of wrestling
LDS isn't funny it's cringe
This side of Cody needs to stick around
This promo was really...........meh. Very long winded. I expected more. After The Rock cooked him so badly, im really disappointed this was the response back.  The LDS line was the only funny/good line out of this whole thing.
cody promos are so lame
im already over this. i dont even wanna see this match anymore
This was genuinely amazing. Keep this type of vibe moving forward.
Look likes we're now in Attitude era II!
At this point, if the Rock turned on Roman, I wouldn't even like him still. Lmao. He's now the populist just trying to get good PR. Cody shredded him.
lol okay this is officially getting really good
I'm sorry, Rock killed you..
It’s a setup😭
I don't get how this is crazy.... the rocks been through way worse trash talking by HHH, Steve austin, and Jericho. Just because someone calls him a rated r term doesn't mean they're good on the mic, it just makes them average
This is really what people want?? 😂😂
Cody's gotta knock off the crying and get ballsy with it. This sounded great. More of this x2
Yea bring it back to TV14
Anyone else feel like paul heyman was about to introduce brock lesnar? The way he was talking was like from 2020
Great promo but still tho Everyone must Acknowledge The Tribal Chief☝🏾☝🏾 One Of The Greatest Of All Time ☝🏾☝🏾
Give us Rock vs Cody’s mom at WM 41
He's so cocky.. the legend  and the script the creators made just amazing and exciting.   (sold it )
Boring..bring Vince back
I have a feeling Cody will have a friend flying in from Saskatchewan on Friday.
Why is the sound always so bad on the USA videos?
0:59 nope that’s Razor Ramon
Well this is obviously a trap. 😂
Honestly imo the best heel in wwe is for years since the attitude Era is TRIPLE H
It's wild that the WWE YouTube channel has over 100m subscribers, and this channel only has 462k. That brand allegiance is kind of cringe.
Congrats Paul on the Hall of Fame ✅🏆🎧🐐🐐🔥🔥💐💐💐
I'm gonna guess Tama Tonga is gonna have an impact in cody vs Roman match
Did Cody just say "If you Will".  I'm a big Dusty fan, "If You Will".  I hear Dusty was a huge Cody and Dustin Fan as well.  The American Nightmare, Cody Rodes!!
Cody REALLY needs to being up rocks movie cintracts an the fact they state "his characters can only take so much damage" as in he dont wanna get beat up in a freakin movie bro.. talk about petty..
Did The Rock just bring The Attitude Era Back 😂😂😂 WE definitely gettin to see a Attitude Era Cody...somethin that was impossible.
LDS is priceless
🔥🔥🔥promo
A Hall of Famer in a wrestling  company and has not taken a bump in the  last 20 years
I guess we  are done with the PG stuffLDS😮
Harsher tone, darker suit.....heel Cody coming?
The video is over and I'm still waiting on Cody to "roast" the Rock. Smh
Whispering in his ear is crazy 😂😂
This truly is the new boom period for wrestling and I feel honored to witness it.
Rocky!
If the WWE goes back to its old ways I’m definitely turning heel and watching it every week
It had to be said! Cody is the best 👏👏👏
LDS is insane
Paul Heyman Chief Negotiator 😆
It is so hilarious that the loser AEW fanboys booed this guy, and now he is the biggest babyface in the business!
He’s gonna be Cody Rhodes manager
Cody Rhodes talking heel with a Black Suit on...... They all should run when the hair goes dark😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I could've sworn the whiny wrestlers were complaining about the cursing Rock was doing and they had to stay within the pg guidelines. I guess that changed??
As sarcastic as Cody is... yes the WWE NEEDS saving 😂😂 it's a joke right now. The Rock literally brought new life to WWE.
You don't make a deal with th devil unless you have an ace up your sleeve. Cody better have a plan going into friday night with roman reigns
“Athhhole” 👅💦
Heyman: “I apologize”  Pat: “We Accept”   Don’t ever change Pat 😂
wwe so live again 🔥🔥🌡️
thats more like it, Cody.
Good promo Cody .
Cody alone? I mean he doesn’t have a stable or a crew or a tag team 😂😂😂
He better not trust that bloodline always show up
This promo run For wrestlemania has been entertaining probably the most entertaining it’s been in years
“LDS” 😭😭
This is definitely ain’t PG
So roman comes alone but the rock doesnt come alone
Wait until WWE goes to Netflix I’m sure it won’t be too PG anymore
I love this
Bloodline story  line is tired by Paul Heyman never disappoints.  He delivers every single time.
The I love your mom she helped me chop Kevin Owen’s in a dark match 😂😂😂
Crikey that was tedious…
Next rock concert: bring out Willie Nelson and the security guard and call out Cody's mama 😂
Did I hear the word “heel” on WWE tv?? 👀👀 they don’t think you guys are stupid anymore! 🤓👏
Maybe an unpopular opinion, but I hate seeing WWE using wrestling slang on tv. I know kayfabe died decades ago but it’s like they don’t even care anymore.
Another conservative promo from cody
Great League of Their Own Reference
Ok…. This is like a glimpse of the Attitude Era & the Ruthless Aggression Era
He Cooked The Rock 😮‍💨, Not Gonna Lie 🔥🔥☝🏾
The Homelander reference gave me chills
That's is very true and real
So tired of this title Run.. so many others in the locker room that can run with it
They might as well put up tv 14
Maybe with vince gone  they can cut unscipted promos again..
5:50😂
Rather you like the wwe or not it has been entertaining. You can most definitely see the shift change 😂
Jason Jordan cookin with this bloodline story
Ok im sold. Good bye PG ERA..
Heymen will go down as the best voice on a mic of all time
When John Cena roasted The Rock, that was cool. But Cody Rhodes made the best roast.
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮 it’s 1998 all over again 😂😂😂
The way this storyline is going the rock gonna take reigns belt after they lose night 1 n face Cody himself
Best promo Cody’s ever cut
I think it's going tobe a good long match
I think it's going tobe a good long match
Great promo by Cody and Paul Heyman (hopefully the AEW talent took notes).  As for "coming alone"... NO Bloodline Members.  Perfect time to introduce another FAMILY MEMBER 🤔.  As for Cody, Seth simply comes out and says "I go where I want, when I want".
What is going on here 😂😂😂😂
Can’t wait to see how Roman gone school him Friday
Cody forgot to mention there's no known cure for LDS 😂
LDS Yeah! 😂
This feud should go double switch .....with Rollins turning his back on Cody to cost him the first night and in turn turn heel and second night against all odds under bloodline rules rock cleans up the back ups and shocked reigns loses to Cody...would finish the story ...
Cody crybabies are in tears as always 😢 😭  lol
As Stone Cold Steve Austin would say DTA don't trust anyone especially not the weasel Paul Heyman or Roman. The second the ref gets knocked down someone will come out to help Roman win
These promos are extremely boring by this dude. I’d rather watch ANYONE besides this garbage. Promos have become so lame and cringey it’s ridiculous
cody heel turn would be lit sometime after mania
lol show up alone doesnt mean they are still alone the whole night, bloodline not there doesnt mean they wont have others not in the bloodline there on roman and heyman side, so many loopholes.  also funny how they keep painting cody and his fans as crybabies considering how much roman whines and cries that no one will acknowledge him for years now.
The Rock is a Mid-Boss
About dam time it goes higher the fing pg-13, dam I’ll be pay attention now
Cody made a bad mistake watch and see Friday night.
Paul Heyman is so good it’s crazy. Can be so serious and hilarious at the same time
Rhodes....you are a loser... the Rock and Roman, will smash you...will stack you...and pin you...1...2...3...
Why does the crowd noise sound fake
The piped in chatter is too loud at certain parts.
It wasn't that great of a promo
Wow
The audio on these are always trash
One thing that gets lost in this whole thing. Is the brilliance of Paul Hayman? I am so glad our kids get to see the same guy. We got to see when we were younger
$100 says stone cold comes out at WM to help Cody
Meh. Cody same here and same at A3W
Does this dude ever stop crying?
This is pure gold!!!!
Cody! Cody! Cody!!!! 🔥🤘
Trash television. Hope ufc shuts this trash down.
Cody dropping bombs. Cody: I know your mom
Paul got emotional for a sec…
Cody is weak, boring punk. Period. Like the signs say, his story put me to sleep.
I don't think you're a heel.. I think you're a ... LFG
Thank you for leaving this uncensored!
Aew father insults Monday night raw mother insults
Great stuff. WWE is getting some old school back
The Rock is carrying Roman’s whole feud by himself
I don’t like stardust he overrated
I feel like Roman is gonna set a trap for Cody on Friday and out of nowhere, Seth and Jey will show up to make the save.
90’s vibes right now with this promo
When cody wears a light color suit, he's a face, when he wears a dark color suit, he's turns into a heel
Did he salt of the earth ??hmm MJF🤔🤔
Cody cooked, ate, went back for seconds and had dessert with this promo
Cody is so good on the mic
LDS
Cody is winning against Roman
Cody is him Cooking on the 🎤
"Let me tell you about Rock's mom. She is a wonderful lady 😐" got me for some reason haha
Rocks burns are so much better than Cody's
😎👍
Well I’d say we graduated from PG 🤣
Can we just make this Rock vs Cody
Things gets real when stuff gets personal. So it makes these promos 100 love it...
Ppl can complain about the rock but this is the best wwe TV in a long time
Lds lds lds
Let this feud COOK!!!!
Cody might have won me over completely with this promo
The piped in audience noise needs to go jesus christ
Bye bye pg era
I have to ask, after let's say Cody wins and wins again and gets that world title. Let's say he is our new champeen. Then what? What's next?
WWE IS GOING TOWARDS ATTITUDE ERA.... LET'S GO!!!!
paul hayman salls that so well
Roman is basically the Miz when John Cena and The Rock were about to start beefin for their match 😂 just completely overlooked.
Yeah, uh….. WWE? Keep this up.
Cody sounded more like his dad than he ever has in this promo.  A lot of Dusty in there...................even used the "If you will" line............
I bet The Rock wrote this script lol.
Can we acknowledge that EVERYONE stood up when they heard “LADIES AND….”! NO entrance music. For a manager!! Paul is the GOAT
Loved The Boys reference. Brilliant promo
Rock deserved it did he really think he could diss codys mom and get away with it heck no cody has every right to call him an A Hole
Cody wearing a black suit should've told us where this promo was going
They a little less pg. Ripping each other verbally. This is great!! I love it. Looking forward to every week like when I was a kid.🔥🔥🔥
LDS 😂😂
WWE hasn’t blurred the lines like this since Punk’s original pipebomb in 2011. This is great tv
nuthin about dis guy feels genuine
this promo is amazing im glued
Welp pg era is over. Love it.
Wouldn’t it be something to see Cody become a Paul Heyman guy after Cody gets rid of Reigns at WM?
ATTITUDE ERA 2 JUST KICKED OFF , HOPE THE REST OF THE WORLD FOLLOWS LMAO
🖕to all Cody crybabies
I wanna see Michael Cole’s real time reaction to this
Didn’t Roman cheat in tribal battle against Jey?
Attitude Era 2.0! 🎉🎉
Cody consistently cuts some of the best promos in the entire industry 🔥
I feel jey gone change on Cody after jimmy and jey right he back in the bloodline
I don't even know if that's PG!
Oh my God Cody dont compare yourself to homelander 😭 he’s not a flex
They had to sideline the rock for Roman to get some shine lol
Is cody even fighting Roman anymore or its gonna be cody vs rock lol,  I feel like little by little they setting that fight instead 😅
Seems like a Bloodline setup for Cody... when has Roman ever been alone
Cody looking to get jumped next week 😂
I like Cody... But he has little kid jokes. Lol
11:32 I’ve laughed so hard that Cody said, “I’m about to go full Homelander and rip your throat out, alright?” 😂
03:47; shoulda mentioned his dad...and his six...
So much for that PG money lol
Not going to last long , WWE sux
Jabba The Paul
If Cody Rhodes doesn't win at WrestleMania, it will be one of the biggest blunders in WWE history
Ya aint no way cody be showin alone because he knows bloodline won't be their alone
This promo is the best pro mo of 2024
Boring
Its a setuppo
Lately WWE been kind of feel it’s bringing back the attitude era…
WWE being that real feel back and not scared to say certain things their helping bring back America too
Bro... I don't really want to see them toe to toe until MANIA. I hope they don't have a match. We need it to be special, exclusive to WrestleMania!
This is riveting television.  Gotta like more realism in wrestling.  Makes it more fun and worth watching.
Can't wait for Dustin Rhodes to save the day.
Roman side chick is wild lmao
This is great all the way around
I feel Roman has a trick up his sleeve on SmackDown. Perhaps Rock may interfere with his weight belt, maybe even a certain Guerilla of Destiny may come into the fold? This is definitely a great story.
I would really like to be able to see the “real ratings” for each episode of RAW and  Smackdown going back as far as I want. But also up to date! Not the BS ones WWE tells us to make people think it’s just still going up so you better get your tickets quickly, like how they fake the attendance numbers all the time!?! Because that whole ending of this felt very desperate! It sounded like “please please please watch Friday! It will be the same, but different! Please watch and but tickets!” at least to me!??
If WWE doesn't put the title on Cody on April 7th. They might as well have him come out as Stardust on April 8th on Raw.   Because absolutely no one will care about him ever again. And definitely no one will care about the Story again.   This has been going on for 2 years now. And it's growing stale. Don't get me wrong I love Cody. And he definitely deserves the belt. But enough is enough.
LMAO @ the Homelander reference 😂
I love that Paul gets just as big of a pop that any of the other wrestlers get  It makes me so giddy everytime
Cody could be right that the rock is a terrible salesman like promoting the accorn debit corn that people go broke anyways
Cody in a black suit is the equivalent to me in black Air Force ones 😂 let the games begin
I’m so tired of the muting. I can’t even watch anymore. It’s too distracting. Good run though.
Bro, why do I feel like Paul Heyman is gonna turn on Roman at WM?
Facts Cody
Only thing we are missing is JR and king along side Michael Cole
You know I’m really liking this kinda attitudish era promo that Cody and Rock are doing. And let’s be honest the rock has made wrestling even better since his return.
3:48- Honestly, any time I even hear the rocks name I normally start tuning out , give a thumbs down and start looking for a different video! And if the rock is actually on the video and I have to hear him talk, at all in the video…… yeah, I’m just skipping it all together!!! But Cody is speaking more truth here, then all of WWE has in the last 4 years combined!!! I don’t like Cody…. But I like him a bit more now!
That’s a bad idea it’s probably a setup
Nice promo 😂 LDS
Cody’s mom vs Rocky’s mom at wrestlemania😂😂😂
Ultra Rogue Cody Black with black Air Force energy lol
Dead crowd
LDS!!!
Dude the fact he acknowledged hes wwe homelander is great Ive been thinking that for a while
I know Kayfabe has been dead for ages now but naming Rocks personal writer is a bit much.
I don’t think the Paul Heyman walk gets talked about enough.
Was this not live? What’s up with all the fake crowd noise
Heyman is worth his weight in gold
Tell me, he didn't just say that
YEAH CO! 😂😂😂
Cody roads finally said whatever body else has been thinking
Paul's careful wording is key here, I believe. Roman "shows up" alone... Doesn't mean the bloodline doesn't surprise attack Cody, and he will be without support from Seth
This was 🔥
he should bring up how rock and oprah are stealing all the property from people in hawaii who had their houses burned and then how rock and oprah were begging people to donate money while they didn't donate anything.
Geez that’s a good promo. It’s a shame we didn’t get this Cody in AEW. They’d be doing a lot better.
I Love Uncensored WWE
One of the best promos cut against the rock !
WWE keeps proving all the dirt sheets wrong
this guy is boring.
I would love  to see the bloodline vs the bullet club(aj..gallows...Anderson  and Cody rhodes
Like Cody isn’t usually alone
It seems a little quiet in there cody😂
Does anyone miss the Ramp like I do? Probably wasn’t the greatest on knead I’m sure.
About time they send Roman out to cut a promo. I get it. You have the Rock- you use the Rock. But everyone else is looking weak in comparison. And at least Rhodes and Rollins are out there selling. Reigns has said all of two words.
we need stone cold
Cody stepping it up! I’m impressed. 👏
Real fans are picking up on the words there using . Like Roman telling Rock to Acknowledge him . We know the Rock don’t do that and Rock will turn on Roman and Cody becomes new Champ. Roman gets mad at the Rock afterwards and then Rock vs Roman storyline begins to see who is head of table lol. If Cody not becoming champ it’s pointless for him to resign with WWE it’s all waste of time.
1:36 im think the same
So lame
Would’ve been better if he called the rock a stepping stone instead of Roman’s side chick
goosebumps. thank u so much for this lol
Waiting for Paul to drop the HOF card.
Soft😊
i can tell you right now that reigns will retain the title at wm..reigns is approaching hogans record of longest reign in wwf history..i personally dont think hogans record should be broken but that decision isnt up to me..wwf is still predictable of what the outcome is gonna be..i hope to see the rock betray the bloodline and help rhodes win it but that wont happen
Why they always talk bout moms is not hype
WWE needs to allow to Cody Rhodes to finish his story and cause The Rock to turn on Roman Reigns
I am so ready for Rock and Roman to shut this dudes mouth! I’m kind of like really tired of him and Seth talking about nothing
Cody CryBabys
I will sit right here and bide my time  As long as it takes to get what's rightfully mine And I won't be denied Cuz all I've got left is my pride And I will rise up Break it out Break you down Breakin' through Breakin' ground Had your chance Now it's gone All you take All you've done All I've done  And I will sit right here and I will wait  Patiently for your last big mistake  And I won't be denied Cuz all I've got left is my pride And I will rise up  Break it out Break you down Breakin' through Breakin' ground Had your chance Now it's gone All you take All you've done I control My own fate And for you It's too late It's my dream It's my way It's my life It's your pain  And I won't be denied Cuz all I've got left is my pride And I will rise up Break it out Break you down Breakin' through Breakin' ground Had your chance Now it's gone All you take All you've done And I won't be denied Break it out Break you down Breakin' through Breakin' ground Had your chance Now it's gone All you take All you've done Break it out Break you down Breakin' through Breakin' ground Had your chance Now it's gone All you've done  -Drowning Pool
Cody Rhodes is always be a midcard
they allowing cursing again? Lets go! lmao
I think this is the first time someone has owned The Rock on the mic since John Cena. This is just a testament of how good Cody is on the mic because it's not easy to be on par or better than Rock on the mic.
If I wasn't watching this whole time, I could swear it will be Cody vs Rock at Mania for the title.
5:54 yo he went there!!!!!!!
Bruh is attitude era back?
Why not say *YEET*
Send Cody back to the knockoff wrestling😂😂
WWE is 🐂💩 now if Cody is the face 😈😭
Paul Heyman is the absolute goat on the mic. There’s nobody else that I appreciate for making my skin crawl. Heels today are afraid of being hated and it’s a major issue imo.
Ugh this guy is so trash. I would rather see Ricochet or Finn Balor in this position. Maybe even Dom! Anyone but him. Yuck
I just might quit watching if they go with that storyline
Cody and Seth need to win the tag match but knowing the writers at WWE they will lose and it will be bloodline rules
Rocks promo was still better.
This was a ok promo....
He's so not believable. He's stardust. I have never been able to buy into this guy. Plus In real life we know the rock kills him in a fight. I just can't buy I to this guy. The only matches of his I eat h are the ones he loses. Even his moves are trash. His brother is actually better. I hope he loses so bad. If he wins at Wrestlemania I might stop watching until he loses the title
Bring back the attitude keep doing what you guys are doing
It's a shame that The Rock shows up more than Roman does lol
I’m not a big Cody fan but once I saw the black suit…I just knew he was gonna cook
I mean you can’t disagree that all dwayne has done since returning is cry, complain and threaten to take peoples jobs because he didn’t get his way with Triple H
Attitude Era stan here.  After rewatching everything recently and thinking back, I don't ever remember a time I was this hyped for a Main Event.
You know I want to see to come back even for one night bring back Kavel have him join the bloodline as revenge what Cody did years ago
Heyman needs a new gimmick. It's always the same old tired thing.
Shots fired at TKO.  Most execs are really just yes men though.
This that ring of honor and new Japan Cody Rhodes
Wrestlemania better filled with signs
This is how the give Cody a storyline injury and we get Roman Reigns vs The Rock
U must be stupid if u think Cody will show up alone on smackdown where the bloodline is u must be stupid if this gonna be a fair fight Cody may have agreed but no one else have I know it won’t be a fair fight
Cody cooked tonight! Holy S***
Cody wearing black was perfect.
That Brian Gerwertz line was golden,He writes all the material for the rock
Cody never seems to age, I wonder, do you think it has anything to do with him being a mistake
Weekly pipebombs now. This is gold.
This whole program has been goldn
Between the rock cody and a few others and their choice language are we entering the attitude era 2.0?? I hope so ive been waiting for the wwe to kinda catch up with the times. AEW has been doing a great job with allowijg color again in wrestling which i love as long as its not abdoullah the butcher style with blood just everywhere.
AEW level promo 😂😂
The key word. If
The Scorpion king got a tiny ding o ling
Cody going aew on that niqqa😂😂
😮😮😮😮😮😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂lmaoo
Cody don’t do that. It’s a lie. It’s a set up. I want to let you know that.
I think Cody decided to become a anti hero in that promo
Good now focus on Roman 🥴
Cody Rhodes is going toe to toe with The Bloodline, The Rock and Paul Heyman and has made a deal with Paul Heyman to make it happen with a confrontation that could be very difficult for Cody Rhodes
This guy is lame
CR is ready always ready when it comes to face off RR alone.the question is, will he show up alone.
Wrestling has been pushing the limits for about 4 years now. I'm loving and enjoying every moment. Cody and Jey uso especially. Tremendous promo by cody rhodes tonight
I know he didn't say the rock is a terrible salesman, as if anyone cared about wrestlmania before he did what he's doing. 😂😂
Cody is dull and boring. Went from using Dusty has an excuse to his mom. Crying last week and dull this week. Pathetic
I was expecting no more smiling but get serious with a huge comeback response
I'm waiting for Dwayne 'The Karen' Johnson.
I already know how  this deal finna go at Friday night smackdown.
The rock better send cody a check!
Aw yea Cody cooked
Are you gonna cry cody😂
Feel like Paul gonna turn on Roman unfortunately
Yes woohoo 🙌 finally thank you God bless 🙏 I love you wwe ❤️
Little dic syndrome is crazy
Cody is corny
I love how the pg era is finally gone
The Rock helped Cody with that promo lol
It’s wild that Cody went from Stardust to winning two Royal Rumbles and main eventing Wrestlemania three times in two years.
Roast lolololol  Alll he roasted was the Rocks nuts
Cody Roman Rock and Seth pretty good on the Mic 🎙️. The talent on the wrestling skills would make the Great Legends in Heaven Dusty and Rocky Proud.
Imagine if Obafemi 🥵🏆 & Bron Breakker 💔🏆 became a Crew under the leadership of The Beast Incarnate (☠)?  Monday Night Raw, NXT and Friday Night SmackDown beware of intensity 📺⛽ 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Vacation Chief has 2 side chicks: the rock and Paula Heyman 😂
Gold, Cody, gold
that boy cody know he can cut a good promo 😮‍💨😭
Perfect Response!!!
That piped in crowd noise is annoying af
Ok that ending was dumb... its not like seth and cody are a walking talking tag team.
Cody got people fooled like Trump, Cody you the real heel. Neoplasm at his fullest.
I could see paul heyman turning on the bloodline and managing cody as the new champion
Still boringly predictable
Paul Would make a good BatMan Villain
LDS LDS LDS😂😂😂
I cant take cody theriouth
I love when Cody says “rock thought wwe needed saving “ judging by the numbers they were doing fine now yes rock made the numbers even higher but it’s not like numbers were low
Now THIS is it! Ruthless and edgey promos like this! I love it when the commentators talk over a bit like the old days when they put their own two words in the segment! It blurs the lines between kayfabe and reality! All we need is to go TV-14 (I know it's a longshot) and the product can go UP big time! Good stuff WWE
So, what are they gonna talk about....?
I know cody isn't talking about LDS when he literally cried almost every week since his return, you know who cries a lot, women.
Soooo we saying D*ck now??
LDS
LDS
LDS
LDS!!!!! Yo they’re breathing life back into wwe!!!!!
Uncensored, is this the rise of a new attitude era? 🤯🔥
Why do I here this weird background noise 😂
No way WWE lets an ex AEW leader beat Roman. He will eventual win a belt but no way against Roman. Seth will interfere especially if he loses his belt.
The best promo of 2024 🎉
Cody’s promo had MJF’s fingerprints on it
Any angle that’s been cooked up in the bloodline as been gold. WWE didn’t start getting cool again it’s been cool the day Roman came back as a heel.
That LDS line just told us that the PG era is gone and wwe is BACK🔥🔥🔥
😴😴😴
Wtf is up with all the pipped in noise?
LDS! LDS! LDS! 🤣🤣🤣
Cody Rhodes is now Cody Cooks?
As an OG Cody Crybaby, Someone who has grown up with him and loved him since the Legacy days, loved him through his darkest times [looking at you stardust], and through the entire wrestling revolution he started... I cant wait to see him win that world title ❤🤘
Blah blah blah blah for months now! 😴💤💤
Heyman needs his own music
Not gonna lie I left WWE awhile ago because of the PG era but this new comeback has got me  hooked    and I'm waiting for WrestleMania big time let's go Cody 😤
roman reigns is coming out of WM as champ. cody will be a boring champ ngl lol
Sooo PG is officially out 😅
Darn good promo
Can anyone imagine this feud if Triple H could wrestle and it was him instead of Seth Rollins. This would been sick
BDE or LDS?
Cody is the face? I wouldve thought The Rock was the way the fans were cheering him on Smackdown last Friday!
I thought Cody Chodes was such a tramp back when I watched wrestling. Suddenly he has me coming back🤔
Welp… now I know where LDS originated from 💀💀💀
That was wild
Homelander Cody yess lol
Plot twist the rock isn’t in the bloodline and comes out and rock bottoms him 🤷🏽‍♂️
Thank you Triple H for this whole thing! And WWE
They didn't censor it because it's on Netflix now... let's gooooo
I like Cody...but this is far from a "Roast"
We just know this Cody Rhodes cannot go toe to toe against the rock on the mic
That's how u sound proper n cuss somebody out at the same time 👏🏽
At 7:45 there's an AEW world title behind Cody
Boring!!
Cody looks like Bryan from Tekken
They better stop this nastiness, before someone winds up getting slapped! 😅
This reminds me of when John Cena did a freestyle diss of The Rock right before their first WrestleMania match 😂😂.
Black suit Cody is a menace 🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥
I swear if u didn’t know them you’d think Cody Dustin n dusty were the same person juss in different parts of his life😂😂
“My name is Paul Herman and I am a WWE Hall of Famer”
“Don’t think for two seconds this locker room needs you more then you need it…” I would’ve ended it with “…just ask DC if they even needed you.”
Here’s the thing, Chances are the smack down locker room is in favor of Cody.
What if roman been strip out in wwe championship what will happen to paul heyman 😂😂😂
The rock is a in shape Paul Heyman 😂😂😂
The rock cry and beg vin desel to come back and when the rock don't get his way he leaves he leaves some business and movies and TV show and wwe and more because he didn't get his way with the vin desel and the rock was mad at vin desel for having Paul walker still going on in the movie and the rock was trying to take Paul walker spot on the movie and make fans forget about Paul walker and vin desel was auger and mad about it and vin desel and the movie stuff promise Paul walker he will finish the movie with him and the rock was mad and left the movie and wanted people and the fans to hate and think vin desel is a bad guy and should let Paul go and the fans was mad about what the rock said and try to do and that's hard to let someone go when they are gone im still doing that with my dad when I lose him and its hard and I know vin desel is feeling
attitude era confirmed
Cody Rhodes should be made to wear a dunce hat if he falls for Roman showing up alone, and Cody does. I.dont believe it - not for a second.
Cody in a black suit is giving me “heel” vibes 🔥🔥  Foreshadowing maybe? 👀😎
Lovee cody promos this is awesome
😂
This is my first time seeeinh Paul heyman entrance in 12 years and he still pops off “ my name is Paul heyman” 😂
I have ALWAYS thought Cody was under used and very underrated. I am very glad to see him get his time to shine as he has definitely deserved.
I mean it was ok, but I'm sorry, the rock has carried this story this far and made it exciting
Bobby!!!!!
Wwe going to Netflix and they are like “we don’t have to be PG there so let’s start easing into it”
This promo was🔥
Paul Heyman could play the Penguin in a Batman movie
Cody good on the mic 🥶
I hate to say this but..... Cody is gonna lose again at WrestleMania! He just don't move the needle enough. His promos are ok but there not captivating.
Oh my 👀👀👀👀
Roman winning
Not gonna lie this was underwhelming
This is beyond getting boring with just talk segments 🙄but that’s RAW for you.
Rock Bottom out of nowhere to Cody Rhodes this Friday on SmackDown!
Cody Rhodes can play Batman and give us that Christian Bale vibe
This is why it’s better to level up the rating it gives for more interesting and fun promos
Roman's Side Chick 😂😂😂
Yesssss my son cody will do anything to protect his family his mother and even all of us to also make sure if you ever mess or manipulate my son cody he will show you why you should never mess with the American nightmare himself especially if you have a little d syndrome❤.
Of course there is no way that Reins would lie to Cody. Lol
Cody got all the cheat codes for this final boss 😂
You mean Cody is finally allowed to cut an original promo and he nails it? Nooooo. It's almost like every other word out of his mouth doesn't have to relate to "the story".
so much hardcam. WM is gonna be awesome.
😂
Heyman has got something up his sleeve , planned for Cody on Smackdown. and it will not go well for Cody.  Now waiting for The Rock to come up with a comeback. in what Cody just said.
Is this what people hear on Paul heymans. Voicemail ? My name is Paul Heyman. lol 😂
The Rock isn’t in the bloodline though
I call CAP on the Willie Nelson story yeah right
Tama Tonga debuting on Smackdown?
Uncensored is music to my ears !!
Cody ?! Finally you grew some balls
No that’s you crying behind the scenes that’s how you got to the spot you’re in for your effing story so sick off Cody you are not HIM
Chicago  Raw next Monday  and The Rock RAW IN Brooklyn  New York   next 2 weeks  Of Monday  will be fire 🔥
if he lose would it hurt
Gotta say, I haven't been this interested in a fued in 20 years
I'm so down for Homelander Rhodes!
WWE has skyrocketed past its prime in recent times without Vince in charge, love to see it!
Full homelander😭😭😭
Cody is WHACK
Not full homelander, good lord Cody.
This is the biggest difference in Sports Entertainment vs Pro Wrestling.. Cody is the only one of the 4 that’s actually wrestled since this feud started.. Rock, Roman and Rollins just Promos.. It’s been promo after promo not a single match but they have us all on the edge of our seat every segment.. Reason being is we care about all 4 Characters that’s what’s missing from the other promotions.. It’s all about in ring action no storylines or character development.. This is Sports Entertainment in its most Elegant form..
F your story Cody. No one cares!
Cody "I Know Your Mom" Rhodes.
Um. Where’s the roast? All I see is a guy trying his hardest to cement himself as the guy when he’s clearly a filler til something better comes along. Lol just a another workhorse to get to the next phase. I.e. another Cena / Seth aha
Cody is wildin
That’s a roast? Pretty weak!
This get better every time 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So NEITHER side is showing up alone. It’ll be fun to see KO come out to help at WM
This is an excellent promo and the attitude wwe has been missing for a long time.
Cody couldn’t roast marshmallows.
Never knew a lisp could make curse words sound so much worse 😂😂😂
Finally some adult content. Get these kids outta here for real👍🏾
Are we officially out of the PG era?
Wwe stands for talking show. Miss the old days no matter what location is going down for sure. Now is like every week is Cody talking show or bloodline talking show 😂 need more action less promo
mfs talked almost 13 minutes and said nothing at all. boring
I know I’m not the smartest s’mark… but this is pretty obviously a matter of technicality  Roman ~will~ show up alone with only Paul Heyman  There won’t be a *single* member of the BL there to back him up  …  …  Solo, Jimmy and Rock will show up *after* Roman…  Not a ~single~ member of the BL, but rather all *3* other members will appear and back up Roman…  Technically Heyman is telling the complete truth, and literally Heyman is setting up Cody to be more underdog than any dog has ever under’d  I suspect that Cody will have already accounted for this…  Cody will show up alone, but his backup will have already been there all day, hours before he ever arrived himself
Great Deal
It's crazy how they're making us believe that Cody is on The Rock's level.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
The beginning of the Cody Rhodes' Era... ?
another stellar promo by the king
We're transitioning back to the cussing era😂
f*ck that was a good promo by Cody
That line about his mom was funny and serious usually cringey im glad it wasn't
Cody just can’t hang with the rock on that mic.  Having to forcefully use  cuss words comes off weak.  He’s be better off  to keep playing the under dog promos.
LDS 😂😂😂😂
Cody has become a master on the microphone.  If he wins at WM he will be shot to the moon.  If not further.
How does Paul Heyman shave his folds?
This is how you put butts in seats and sell pay per view packages! Cody sounds and moves like his daddy..
Even if Roman does show up on Friday, Cody shouldn't. Now is not the time to be honorable. Now is the time to be smart. I would love nothing more than to see Cody, Seth and Jey Shield Bomb Roman through the announce table. It's like I keep saying Cody needs to go full homelander on The Bloodline. How awesome would it be if he showed up at Wrestlemania in homelander inspired gear.
He's going to turn heel Cody Rhodes is going to win the title and become healed trust
No bloodline... so someone outside the bllidline. Drew?
Cody is so good on the mic
THE GOOD BROTHA CODY DISSED TF OUTTA LDS ROCK 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🫄🏽🫄🏽🫄🏽
Boring
Cody is beautiful isn't he......
Thank you wiseman... I was about to fall asleep!
I wouldn't trust Heyman, I would have a game plan of my own
Is it me or does rock look like a turtle without it’s shell
This was the best promo ive seen since the additude era ... Great promo from. Cody
Cody with the Homelander intro for Wrestlemania XL!  Do it
Cody whoop the rock
I love this 😂
Can someone confirm they left the heel line in for the westcoast? I didnt notice it.
Boring. Finish the Bloodline/Cody thing (both of em). It's been two freaking years, little wrestling and occasional Rock promos from the past. They're mailing this in at this point, the audience is an easy mark.
I feel this is going to be like the attitude era. That wasn’t pg my friends. 😅
Prediction: Cody/Seth lose because of Shenanigans. Then in the bloodline rules match, everyone comes out. Sami, Jey (+ Jimmy and Solo maybe), Kevin, etc etc turn it into a fair fight. Cody goes Rambo mode.
Roman you gotta step it up dawg we done forgot about you in this whole storyline and this coming from a long time reigns fan 🤦🏾‍♂️
Nice homelander reference
Didn’t he distracted the ref last year?🤨
They reall aint censor nothing
Who wrote this promo it's So Generic and Forced and the crowd is bored  😂
Paul heyman message from Roman Reigns on Raw challenge Cody Rhodes American nightmare Roman Reigns will show up on long on smackdown  thin Paul heyman Wiseman say to Cody Rhodes show up to Smackdown next week
It's a setup Roman says he showing up alone and solos and Jimmy and the rock are gonna be hiding some where to blind side attack codya nd make it a four on one and I hope Cody got Seth Rollins and Jey uso as his back up just in case and we all know the bloodline never leaves Roman alone there always lurking around somewhereb
The road's really getting to Cody, his face is getting really weathered. Hope he's doing okay.
POV: You didn't know Cody's mom was bout dat life!
Cody making them say "uhhhhhh"
🐀💯✨
On smackdown its brock lenser!!!!!!!
7:27 bald guy been waiting for that moment 😭
Finally AEW/NJPW Cody style promo, much more freedom on the mic and Cody is glowing.
Cody Rhodes talk about The Rock on Raw thin Paul heyman can't out Apologize to Cody Rhodes on Raw
Homelander 😂
My boy COOKIN
If that’s the best promo Cody can cut then no wonder why they won’t ever put a serious title on him
3:20 😂
The rock elevates these Jabronis every time 😂😂. Nobody even care about Roman at this point.
Im calling it and i think i might be right WM40 Night 1 The Rock and Roman win the Tag Match and on Night 2 towards the middle or end of the match Bloodline interferes with Rock there and maybe Seth comes to help cody everybody starts taking each other out and once it looks like Roman is going to win agian The Rock surprises everyone and takes Roman out helping cody win and  setting up there Rock V Roman at WM41
STARDUST
I also suffer from LDS.
If you SMEEELLLL how The Rock got cooked! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bloodline shows up to ATL and attacks Brandi.
This is better than crying I guess lol.
Mama Rhodes vs Mama Rock next year WM book it you cowards!!! 😎😎😎
Roman Reigns has become an after thought in this rivalry
This might be the only time I DIDN'T want to see Paul Heyman appear with a microphone. They should've just let Cody cook. Because for the first time in this feud, he finally cooked the Rock.
CODY WAS GOIN CRAZYY😭😭😭
It's a trap!!!
Still not as entertaining as a Rock promo unfortunately
Cody can’t still cut a promo. We need MJF in the WWE.
Thank You Hunter.👍 Uncensored...AWESOME!
At this point, I am more interested in Cody VS Rock than Cody VS Roman. lol
Vince would have never allowed the word “heel”.
He’s such a whine bag just like Brett Hart and CM Punk.
Easy big fella! Easy! 😂
Salt of the earth MJF reference 😂
he acknowledged Codylander
I THINK THIS GOT TOO PERSONAL....
Yes
Would’ve loved to hear Cody bring up Rocks steroid use
Paul just spilled the spilled the beans
I’m wondering if pg-14 comes back when wwe goes to Netflix.
We’re back to the Attitude era. So I guess im watching again.
In parts of this I can hear Dusty.
Cody was out there breaking the fourth wall, and talking smack to The Rock. He really has evolved into a top level star. Hah hah!
For 12yrs ive been a Roman Reigns fan....As of today I've converted. Cody won a new fan🔥🔥🔥
I’m not a Cody cry baby but He missed a opportunity to throw at least a slight jab at The Rock’s Mom when He could’ve said after He said He had no problem with Her and what He thinks of Her saying.. “But when I beat Roman Reigns for the title.. I’m going to offer to place that belt in Your Mom’s hands, So She can know how it feels to be around a real Champion” 😏 Mic dropper
Cody promo was wack but of course the Cody Crybabies will cream themselves over it
Boring WWE has lost all its talent and personality.
Oh Snap that black suit gave Cody some fire power about time.
This Cody vs Rock main event is going to be epic!  That is the main event, right?......
The Rock is not going like this
I still can’t take Crybaby Cody seriously 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾
Getting the crowd used to more profanity for when that first Netflix episode drops
LDS chants is crazy 😂😂😂
See what happens when Vince is no longer there?
MJF is the best heel in the last 25 years.
the Rhodes and Rock drama is pure fire content .. gotta love a classic wrestling beef
CODY WENT ROGUE
Cody was on fire during this segment.
Cody’s best promo. Not very often Heyman ruins a moment, but he wasn’t needed here at all. Not to deliver no news.
That homelander reference 😮
LDS is wild
Hollywood Rock will lay the smackdown on Cody come WM40
☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽
This segment was trash
Finally, now I can hear the TV without it cutting off 🔥  This is what you get when let the wrestlers write their own stuff 🔥
I like Jay Oso
LET’S GO CODY!!! TYS!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥  - Sincerely, A Lifetime Rock Fan
What if Paul turns on Roman and becomes the advocate and mentor to Cody at Mania?? But what will The Rock do that night then? Help make it happen? Im down for that. No matter what happens, im sure it will be great!
Cody did good but I fear that rock finna get in his bag and completely go for the killshot. Rock tends to not just embarrass people but turn fans against the person he’s destroying 😭😭
Cody crybabies all in attendance
Cody dad was legend.
Can i just say i appreciate this non pg awesomeness while we have it and they crack down this is great
probably gunna get roasted, not an avid follower. here and there lately tho….is he offering to cut the rock and seth out basically?
You don’t mention the term heel on TV! Dear lord Cody Rhodes is becoming John Cena 2.0
i love to see this be uncensored
Crowds sound like the attitude era again! WE BACK BAY-BAY!
Vince is gone. And you can tell.
4:30 Cody's mom is a G
Niether one is going be alone
Wheres all the super kicks and flippy piledrivers with no selling is this even wrestling ?
3:21 Shawn Michaels, is that you?
Cody the only thing super new that actual makes wrestling look semi cool and kinda sorta legitimate
The final boss
I wanna know how that match is gonna be interfered with. Deal or not its bound to be interrupted.
Remember Cody if it's tribal rules that means you can have friends there too.
Aew/NJPW version of Cody Rhodes? They allowed that? Alright,I’m listening
Sick of this star=dust B.S. !!! 🖕Cody’s story 💯‼️
Attitude is officially back.
Ok this is the telenovela we've been needing 😂😂😍😍
Sorry Cody I couldnt sit thru 12 minutes of u preaching this time. Fast forward to the matches plz 😅
Zzzzzz
No members of the bloodline? Maybe a recently signed tongan will be there instead.
Anyone else have a feeling Paul will retire after this run?
cody is trash
Cody spitting facts!! Love that aggression
Best Cody promo ever. I can’t help but think he was being 100% completely honest. Wow. People always mistake kindness for weakness. Teach them they are wrong Cody.
Cody is so great on the mic
They should let the rock speak with out being censored.
Best promo from Cody. This is the Cody i have waited to see.
I love Paul Heyman
🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽
I know it's still PG and it's probably not going to be over, but Cody went TV-14 on The Rock. Uncensored a little bit.
Cody looks intimidating mad. If he’s gonna win over Roman we need more of this cody. Less captain America, more American nightmare
Think it’s time Cody gets the n word pass… he even has a black wife.
That lisp 🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂😂
Sound like Cody mom should wrestle the rock
Cody will complete the story so Roman can make movies for awhile. It sounds like a legit plan to me.
Watch Cody Rhodes will turn heal at wrestlemania
I can’t believe aew ruined this guy
That's is a set up for Cody
Never seen such an annoying wrestler in my life
It’s obvious to anyone who isn’t willing to lie to himself that Cody is a mid carder, and his dad had all the charisma . If you disagree , I don’t care. You and I both know I’m right , and any amount of jabber towards my comment means absolutely nothing to polka dot dusty. With that being said , I want Cody to finish his story…..so we can move ON.
The Great one! Has little D**k syndrome!!😂
I’m calling it rock save Cody but Seth turns on Cody but I see Seth turning on Roman too
Wwe needs the rock
RIP the PG era!
I like hearing swearing on WWE again....
Why is the audio so bad
This is the Cody I was waiting for….😈😈
Roman's TRASH
Here’s how I think it’s gonna go… Cody & Seth looses on night 1 to set up night 2…. Where The rock & the bloodline do everything to help Roman win…. AND IT BACKFIRES costing Roman the title…CODY WINS…. Roman BLAMES THE ROCK for the plan going bad… which sets up ROMAN VS THE ROCK at the next major event…..
Cody’s promo was trash. He isn’t ready to be “The face of the company” at all.
Cody was cooking like Gordon Ramsay
Who's Romain again?  Because it's starting to feel like rock vs cody instead of Romain vs cody
😂😂😂Cody out promos the Rock Fr tho.
Homeland? He means star facepaint guy right?
3:46 zAcH WiLsOn WhAt ArE YoU dOiNg??!?
cody didnt roast anything. he is clearly pandering towards his marks lol another cringey promo
this promo was insane 😂🔥
When he said LDS, I never thought he would say Little D*ck Syndrome. I was thinking he would say Little Dwayne Syndrome, but the word D*ck came out instead.
That's what I'm talking about Cody. I need more of this.
They’re letting them cuss and I love it 😅😂😂
"I know your mom" 😅
I agree the rock is an athhole
Rock Vs Cody
The rock is saving the wwe and so Is cody two wrestlers from the early years love both and so happy they both back here
TKO:Rock your muscles looks soo big 😂
They really just told these guys "go out there and say literally anything like its 90's Raw" lmaoooo XDDDD
Weve been getting good promos the past 2-3 years but holy moly this is the best promo ive seen iin several years!!! I 'fin love it!!!
Reigns is going to "show up" alone and have his lackeys come after the fact and jump rhodes.
Legend promo
U never make a deal with the devil
What's the catch? Who's showing up to jump Cody this smells like a setup big time
cody dont listin to heyman bring someone just in case.
LDS is crazy lmao
aew stans cried for years about Cody becoming heel homelander and he just drops it casually. rip
this sucked, especially with how pointless it was for paul coming out.
Appears to me Paul Heyman turns face
LDS
Paul heyman almost broke again 😂 9:08
Bunch of 💩, aint like codys been alone all this time
The fact that hes using the term heel is stupid lol it just takes people out of the story and makes the industry fake than it already is. That's like watching a movie and the actors make a reference that this is just a movie and that we're actors playing heros fighting the bad guys. Just think about that lol 😅
those mics in the crowd sounding like wind going through a tunnel are not only insanely annoying, but also completely unnecessary.
Salt of the earth you say
*pause this promo 🌈
Wwe has been so good I might end up purchasing wrestlemania..
I think Rock and Roman wins night 1 and StoneCold will say F the Boss and Stunner the Rock 😆
cody boringggĝggggg👇👇
Cody Rhodes looks like his heading to a funeral after this
Cody Rhodes all the way ❤❤❤
Cody is so boring.  He has zero charisma…..
Deal🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I saw a report that said Rock has been talked to about cursing on TV. Cody said “hold my beer”
masonic handshake
Team Cody!
Interesting. I audible gasped like 6 times.  You know, everyone thinks that Dwayne is going to turn on Roman but I think it’s gonna be the other way around. Roman doesn’t like sharing the spotlight Roman doesn’t like being the little brother when the rock is around and I think they’re gonna win the tag match on Saturday and then the championship match will be bloodline rules and Cody will bring along his avengers, but I think that something’s gonna happen like Dwayne‘s gonna miss some thing. Roman‘s gonna push him and they’re gonna start fighting amongst each other , and somehow Cody’s gonna sneak in and steal the wind
YOOOOO WHO TF LET WWE NON PG AGAIN
Cody looks old
Can't wait for raw to be on Netflix
WWE being a bit more lax with the profanity and stuff.
Can't wait till Cody turns heel .. he'll be boss heel
0:19 Cody said "The Rock" just like Vince McMahon!!! CHILLS!!
AMERICA BAYBEEEE WE SO BACK
This was on USA? 😂
Lots of insider buzz words.   Paulie with the interruption and over sell of everything. And I’m here for everything!!😊
Cody hides behinds yes men
Omg the way they are building wrestlemania is incredibly amazing
peak WWE bro
Cody dressing like he is a heel is scary, but in the end, him becoming heel would be justified if he loses WrestleMania.
I wouldnt trust that deal with a 10 ft pole
Don't buy that...the bloodline can't be trusted.
Cody, definitely tears Rock a new ones a really big one!
Cody's mannerisms are so annoying i can't take him seriously 😆
The rock is my favorite wrestler of all time and he is the best trash talker in my opinion but Cody Rhodes got him in this one needless to say I don't like saying this I hate saying this but he rocked his bells with that promo
Cody is going to hollywood soon and will sell his soul yet again
Lastly....did Cody just threaten to rip someone's throat out? I haven't heard that threat on WWE programming since Taker threatened somebody on commentary in 1999! I love it! 🤣
Too much talking nowadays, cut the 2 min promo and wrestle omg
Yall gotta remember Cody Rhodes came from AEW sorry for putting that out but he has busted out a new type of Cody Rhodes from AEW to wwe💯🔥
He said no members of the bloodline would be there, didn't mention other heels showing up to attack Cody.....lol
Why did the views and likes go up right when he said LDS 😂😂
Oh it's personal now 👀🍿
I love these wide angle shots.
I'll be at WM 40 and dammit, I'm chanting LDS when I see Rock!!
Ayeee he said my mama hopped out of the chair at a Willie Nelson concert and beat a undercover cop... (SHE AIN'T SCARED OF YOU ROCK) 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I thought wresters couldn’t say who’s a heel or baby face in promos? I guess since Vince McMahon isn’t in charge anymore they can do that
Fake crowd sound
I never noticed how much cody does look like a wwe version of homlander lol
Love he dropped a JIMMY DOOGEN ref
Brandi sure knows how to dress Cody in those suits. Lol
It's going to be good I can't wait to see that Friday night
Great promo!  Let em cook!
Cody Rhodes when savage on the rock That's what we expect to see.
Paul just said he's not trustworthy and he told Cody that Roman would arrive alone. Never said anything about leaving alone.
People complaining about the salty language here would survive one day in ECW and the Attitude Era.  Crazy how keeping that stuff off tv made it so much more impactful
LDS
7:33 I don't think that guy on the right knows how it goes 🤷🏽
Love when Cody calls him Dwayne!
Cody Rhodes finna get jumped 😭😭😭😭
Black suit Cody is like the venom suit for him.
Go AWF Cody!!
This dude is so boring 🥱
huh just thought of something with paul being put in the hall of fame does that technically mean he is a legend now if so he better watch out for the most dangerous 3 letters in sports wrestling entertainment RKO.
Cody is a set up
He ate with this whole promo🤣
Say what you want, and I'm an OG WWF fan but this is the most engaged I have been in WWE in a long time! Cody and The Rock are hitting it out of the park!!!!
I have LDS. But it gets the job done. 😁😁
No way Cody said that 😂
Not The LDS chants lol
We need this Cody all the time!!!🤣
PLEASE KEEP WWE LIKE THIS.
No dont go there
What is wrong with audio. Crazy background noise.
About time WWE went back to making adult content. I can't remember the last time I watched wrestling and got invested in it like this.
That LDS part reminded me of when he was Dashing and called the people of Houston at TLC 2010 victims of IJS, Irritable Jowel Syndrome.
Cody did nice promo 🔥👍🏼
What Cody says is true about the rock he is truly a heel
"Nobody's bigger than the business" Well...except for Brock Lesnar, apparently.
Reigns is not tribal chief. From what tribe? He claims to be a islander. In USA, Hawaii is only island state. Garbage WWE has become.
If Cody beats Roman then HHH is definitely doing a great job job
CAWdy still is boring. The only interesting thing about him is his theme. He's still generic and boring in the ring and still can't cut a promo
I love his facial expressions throughout his promos
Cody went hard
people are booing cody back to AEW thats sad how rock turn things around
😮 it wasnt censored ❤❤  ratings ☝️ attendance ☝️ well played WWE ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  Thank you
Perfect suit for the promo.
11:33 WOW Cody might be the biggest blessing wwe never knew they had
CODY GET THE #=*% OUT OF HERE ROCK AND ROMAN RULE
Little D syndrome!? Oh, he went there!
Nothing better than uncensored WWE promos. Keep them coming WWE, get rid of PG era.
I hate this promo😡😡😡😡
This was Cody's best promo yet. He wasn't just cooking he was on fire.
Is paul losing weight?
Gold.
Yeah the rock is cooked he was stating facts in this promo.
Somebody at USA must have a personal issue with The Rock or something with these titles and thumbnails 🤔🤔
that wasn’t a confident handshake some shenanigans are about to go on this friday
Not undefeated... He lost how many times? Reigns is garbage. Pathetic character.
Hey my guy Cody Rhodes was heated  When he said to the rock "I know ur mom" 🤣🤣😂
Los yesss that's what the bloodline has steroids side effects 😂😂
Let me guess brock is coming too😂😂
When Cody is in a all black suit he means business
Is it Cody vs Roman or Cody vs Rock? I’m confused
Who do you think will win the match roman or Cody Rhodes 👇
Is that a AEW belt at 7:41 in the crowd?
Slowly seeing the attitude/ruthless aggression era returning back love it!
Roman will NOT,be alone! That's always the bloodline way,,,there will be someone hiding somewhere,,,
Sheesh. WWE is getting edgy and I'm here for it.
I feel like this is a setup
Great pr0m0 wish Dusty was Here to see you.
P.R. For the football merger Rock.
These promos are weak. Am I the only one?
This guy isn’t half as good on the mic as the rock
He want said in front of his face 😈
Glad to see him try but he cant compete with The Rock when it comes to these Promos 😅
I"m glad they are letting Cody use profanity, they did not let Cena do it in 2012.  Rock's popularity was built on profanity, so Cody should be able also.
Yo, what's going on 😆 😅😅
Lame
Idk, Cody is boring,lame and self-entitled...Seth on another hand is entertaining 💯
HHH is ALL smiles in gorilla 😂😂😂. He definitely got the 👌🏾 for this
He is not winning biggest fraud of all time......
Cody shooting lasers out of his eyes
Weak promo. Not beating Reigns. Not happening.....
reminder to everyone, Homelander is a psychopathic homicidal maniac.  hes not a good guy, noone should strive to be like homelander
The Rock is Vince McMahon / WWE Bit**!!
Thank God Heyman came out to save this snoozefest.
He can't cut good promo to save his life
Cody please mention how the rocks stupid self got not only himself fired, but also Henry cavil fired from WB! 😂😂😂😂
Roman reigns feels like the miz in his wrestlemania 27 match 😂😂
I can wait for when it’s anything goes and the whole locker room jumps the blood line
What is the deal with the god awful humming on the audio?
"I've known heels and you, Rock, are no heel"- very clever!
I never thought superstars gonna say Heel turn ,but it is Cody Rhode the only one say “Heel Turn”
7:35 Heyman almost says ‘BROCK LESNAR” lol
We know neither one is showing up alone
This is officially the last time i watch wwe. I stopped watching years ago but i keep up with youtube clips around wrestlemania season. I know its fake but 190 pound cry babys beating 300 pound former ufc champions and being the fave of the company is to much. This is embarrassing to have on my tv infront of friends. Goodbye
I could watch Cody and Paul cut promos on each other all day.
$100 says Roman does not show up alone. Boring.
Paul Haymen is brilliant one of the absolute best performers in wrestling history.
Who said Rock was the only one to curse on TV?😂😂😂
The belt roman has doesn't mean anything anymore. He can't wrestle for it alone, in fact he can't wrestle at all
⭐️ Dust sure talk a lot of 💩 WHEN no one is there!!!
Ain't neither one showing up alone 🤣
Get your weight up Cody
The 4th wall breakage is crazy lol
Hasn't Cena done that in recent years?
LDS signs going to be nuts 😂😂
7:50 pause the video right here and if you look closely to the left of the top rope you can see someone is holding the AEW title in the crowd 😂
Cody should turn heel one day just like this. He sounds so phony. He has that suit Jericho look too
Cody gonna his ACL ripped in half
I'm glad they didn't censor this. It comes off a lot better than it would have if it was censored.
Best time to be a fan since 1999
hold on we cussing cussing now
Cody on demon time 😂  😈 💀
This is great 🔥
This crowd is more dead than the Undertaker ☠️
You can't take Cody seriously for nothing maybe it's the lisp 😂
I love Cody, but are they pumping in crowd noises in?
Still not winning at mania, so predictable he basically told us haha
Answer down below 👇 where do u think next year's WM will be Las Vegas or Minnesota?
Cody is a dame fool if he thinks Roman gona show up alone
I really dont think that WWE is going let Cody beat Roman and win the WWE title at WM 40 Roman will still be the WWE champion going in to monday night raw the next night.
Finally cody didnt cry in a promo. Goodjob you finally grew a pair
True leader of Bullet Club
Cody is cooking
I'm so lucky to have cody to talk to me on the social media like telegram and tiktok and Instagram though because I am always going to be his sweet adoring lovely girl and he's always  going to be my sweetheart as well too !! ❤❤
Hope wwe goes back to the attitude era
Bring the real WWF back!!!!!!
Rock and Cody’s promos are absolutely on another level right now. I’m honestly almost forgot Roman was a person watching these two go toe to toe. I would LOVE Cody’s first official defense (backlash maybe?) to be against the great one
Weak
If Paul  Haymen betrays roman at wrestlemania and becomes Cody Rhodes advocate that's best for business 😝
He said it!!! Full Homelander 😂😂😂😂😂
I like this
Hopefully, The Tribal Chief 🦁🏆 show up like he did against Brock Lesnar! Absolutely intensity 📺⛽🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 💣💥! Especially against Seth Freakin Rollins 🏆
Common kid, get with it.  Half way through and I am starting to fall asleep.  At least the Rock was funny!
THEY GONNA GET DEMONITISED ON THIS ONE LOL
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THATS PG!
Let be honest, it pretty much a trap.
The bloodline are cheaters and I wish that someone else step up to the plate. Baltimore MD 🙏
Attitude era part two😂😂😂😂
This feels like attitude era 2.0 is just around the corner.
Bald Dude in the background @7:28 when Paul is talking. 😂😂
If Rocks not a Heel. Cody is a rock 😂 I mean dumb as a 🪨
im gonna need to see Cody's mom take the People's elbow
This was kinda corny…I like Cody but the one liners didn’t really hit
Upgraded Cody. Cool. But, you know Paul..ha.
Whoa!!!
I can’t stand Cody.
lm your biggestfans wwe Championship RomanReigns  you my favorite
The bloodline is now known as L.D.S .
Cody crybabies I love it
Lds is crazy😂😂😂😂😂😂
Cody is rocks son. How you Tryna diss but got a pair of shoes w rocks logo on them 😂
Wow a Cody promo where he didn't burst into tears like a candyass? Refreshing change of pace
Perfect opportunity for Cody to say that The Rock is going to save WWE just like he saved the DCEU 🙃
This Cody promo was off. Anyways he looks like a star.
Cody becoming wwe Homelander after his face run go staled is money
Alright things are heating up a bit
The Roman Reigns vs Cody Rhodes feud has been booked almost 100% perfectly since it started.  I'm so happy to see some long-term feuds and booking
Didn’t expect wwe to let Cody go on all elite out promo on here wwe’s makin this storyline good
Come on Roman won't be alone it'll probably be rock instead an they let Cody talk like that so rock don't seem special make sense
Rock is making Cody step his promo game up just like Cena did for Roman..   Cody was already cutting GREAT promos.. But this was next level.
The Rocks Heel run is to over shadow McMahon drama
Okay! Cody as a homelander type of heel will be crazy. This may be an overlook moment 11:32
Cody can cut a promo I tell you what
My god, Paul Heyman is so good. Not just on the mic, but all of his contributions to pro wrestling with ECW, WWE, and the industry as a whole. Well deserved HOF honor.
I love this shiii
Cody is on fire
He needed this promo!! Finally good job tonight!
This is probably one of the best promos in a long time!
Salt of the Earth?
PIPED in reactions 🤦
Pause… Finally WWE got its balls back! Thanks Rock and Cody!
Let Em Cook
This was amazing television, loved that Cody made the Homelander reference
Ruthless aggression is back!!
The Attitude Era returns…thank God
BIG UPS TO KONNAN AND DISCO LOL YEAAAAH!!!!
I googled what LDS means and google said “latter day saint” so I guess we religious here now?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's lit what's go happen Friday
0:06 did my guy just yell I love you mom 😭
Cody rhodes wouldve been a great to play homelander
3:18
Cody gonna win
Our Favorite Heel? Bobby Heenan? Arn? Ric? AssH0  MJF hints?
Dwayne is only here because of Vince’s rapin. It’s called PR. He’s gross too.
Brock's return at WrestleMania
Its no wonder now...why lame roman has been champ!!...Only bcuz his family is on the board/owns wwe!!
Cody said some bad words big deal. Crappy promo. People really sucking up to Crybaby Cody.
Lds  😂😂😂😂😂
THE ROCK" ,ROMAN SIDE CHICK" 🔥💛🔥
We all know it's a set up for cody to show up alone they are going to ambush but we know seth is going to be there too
Cody finally on The scoreboard  Rock 2-1
I hope Cody doesn’t turn heel.
Corny 😂😂😂😂 tired of Cody Rhodes
Starting to feel like a great thing having the rock back not only as a heel/wrestler but also as an official boss of wwe because we’re getting a little pinch of the attitude era! Great promo Cody seriously!
The black suit was all I needed to see. Cody cutting a great promo. And Paul Heyman! 10/10
Booooooooo you nepo crybaby boooooo you ruin everything
6:56 the Bloodline aura is crazy. Everyone on their feet
This is horrible.  Now it’s curse time it’s boring
Rocky side chick
12:17 crowd goes mild. wtf
There we go finally we got a promo that felt real coming from Cody. We needed more promos like this. I think wwe should just get rid of PG and stick to TV-14
Never knew it was possible to shake hands with a serpent
PG is gone….finally🎤
This just don't change that fact he cry last Monday 😂😂😂 now he out here act like a touch guy
Cody is going to dethrone Roman
You know the promo is good when the announcers break and laugh
Cody Rhodes have faith in urself
Heel ? Their exposing the business  - jim cornette
The Rock isnt even related to the High Chief
He said bad words!!!
You knew Cody was ready to drop bombs when he came out in the black suit
Oh my God his lisp is everything😂😂😂
This is just gonna make The Rock more savage...  Roman and  and specially Seth are only side kicks now
Smackdown on USA and RAW on Netflix is gonna be 🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Crock roasted.  Very easy to do but Cody classically blows The Crock up.
One more segment like this and WWE can compete with AEW content lmao. This is getting 🔥🔥🔥
The hype for stardust is hilarious
This has been the Best WWE in Years, these Promos are amazing!!!
do do they actually wrestle still or just bla bla bla😐??
That lil 🍆 syndrome comment had me ☠️
No swearing!
This is a PG show 😮
WRASTLING IS ON ABSOLUTE 🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥 RGHT NOW WHEEEEW!!!!!!!
Cody Rhodes is not censored whiny b
Cody sounded silly...and stupid.....but then again...this stuff is fake....
Remember the Hawaii incident
Cody is so boring promos are trash
TV-14?? What’s going on 😂😂
Cody can’t do a decent promo to save his life.
❤😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊i love cody Rhodes
March 18 2024 attitude era has made a comeback
ITS A SET UP CODYYYYY!!!!!!!
Dude sounds so corny lol
Someone should add black suit Cody to CC on WWE2k24.
Cody wearing the all black suit. You know he means business.
Love the rivalry so far but I hope in the next couple of weeks it gets more physical aside from a couple of slaps.
I guess the “people’s strudel” ain’t what the Rock thinks it is😂😂
Cody popping off rn
It’s like when you take the leash off Cody he’s the best talker in the business. No goofy songs, no silly catch phrases, no 7-11 burnt hot dog colored tans. Check the resume and watch what this kid was doing on the indies and at aew, there is a reason Vince and hhh went to his and begged him to come back to wwe.   The rock spent the last decade making bombs and killing franchises Cody Rhodes spent last decade tearing up the indies, Japan, and creating wrestling companies. Night in night out Cody has wrestled the best in the world the last decade, Dwayne has been arguing with vin diesel over who gets the most punches in their play fight. Put these two in ring with no writers just fans and microphones and we would see real quick who the real talker is.
Pg13 attitude Era
Finally no more censored b.s.
The Rock is bringing something better out of Cody Rhodes. He had a few good burns tonight. A heel Cody would actually be more entertaining if he embraced his darker side again.
Be nice to see Brock have Cody back
Give Homelander Rhodes some MILK!!!!
Romans side chick was nice and thank god for paul hayman
hopefully yall see that the WWE dirt sheets feed us stuff like "no swearing allowed" to keep stuff like this as a surprise; much like they said Punk wasn't coming back and announced Orton returning at SS.
Whats best for Business is to drop the PG Era (at least a little bit) !!
It’s obvious Roman has a trick up his sleeve so if Cody does come alone I would hope Randy would help him if needed to
Make it pg13 again these promos are getting better
Is WWE PG or not?
Cody if he turns heel or had a dark side like fin balor legit would be the best possible wrestling equivalent of homelander we could get. I feel like that would be so over.
Uncensored!
oooh he said the bad word mommy
This was fun. Lol!
Already tired of the Rock!!! go back to fake hollywood A$$hole!!
Tell it like it is Cody Rhodes I love you very much ❤
Let’s take the time to acknowledge the fact that Cody grew from stardust to this megastar we are seeing today
I don't care what anyone says. This is the greatest story ever told in wrestling. Thank you HHH.
Finally Cody gives a good promo.  It wasn't as good as Rocks on last Smackdown but then again very few can match the Rock on the mic.  Just good to see the face put up some opposition tho lol
This is the best wrestling has been in years.
LDS baby
Yes, this is what we want. More edgy non PG segments, so much more fun and realistic
I don't mean to say this truth or lie Kayfabe is dead.
Roman reigns is going to End Cody Rhodes Story at wrestlemania 40 Cody crybabies
This promo was meh. Cody needed to clap back harder at the Final Boss...
Cody the King of the PG Promo 😂😂 can't  take him or his lisp seriously
The Hollywood theme killed everyone in wwe.. Exposed everyone. Cody make better promos and stop hating so much
Wow Cody giving goosebumps
They definitely opening the doors to the 2.0 Attitude Era for the Netflix contract they signed lol
The Renaissance Era is here to stay bois
Tony Kahn with some Orange dripping from his mouth just snorted the whole mirror while watching this…🤪
who else thinks cody’s gonna get jumped and rock is gonna beat him with the belt and give everyone a sample of what’s gonna happen at wm40
Cody whinninggggggg
Stupid terms roman is goin show up alone but that's cause bloodline will already be there 😂😂😂😂 Cody is a fool 💀
I love Cody Rhodes thank u Cody u finally said it
Bro this promo is one of the greatest
What if it’s a trick
The use of naughty language I love it 😎
And people say Cody can’t cut a promo, bet these are the same people that said the same thing about Roman and look how out that turned out. Wrestling fans are so braindead.😂😭
I Think Coady should play the Ridler   from BatMan
Its up cody
This one is not charismatic at all. Boring!!!
Lds…
😂😂Paul the other side chic lol😂
Cody is the final boss looking like Geese Howard.
Paul Heyman need to call himself like this every time he be like ladies and gentlemen my name is Paul Hall of Famer
The Rock little 🤏😂😂
LDS and diarrhea dwayne? Good lord, these are almost as bad as suffering succotash. I thought Vince was gone.
I liked Paul better when he was with Brock - this tribal chief acknowledgement thing is so stupid.
Bring back ICP for something
Trash..
This the Cody I was looking for 🫱🏾‍🫲🏼🔥
No Bloodline, enter Brock Lesnar
Guess what everybody? Drew McIntyre is NOT a member of the Bloodline... 😀  So when he said no member of the BLOODLINE was going to show up with Roman then.... 🤔
weak, lame promo
Cody must've heard us make the homelander jokes 😂😂😂
Just wait for the response… the rock is cookin
They’ve kicking the pg-13 a little bit since the rocks been back and it’s been so good
and just like that,  the pg era is nomore😭🤣
Whats with all these handshakes with cody and him crying. 🙄 last week. And your supposed to beat Roman Reigns.
I only acknowledge one bad guy and his name was Razor Ramon
No more pg era. Kids go to sleep
I don’t think WWE has the balls to go this route, but after watching this why do I feel like Heyman will turn on Roman and help Cody win the title to end WM40? I know the chances of this are low but it would be insane if it happened.
Now this was a Good Cody Promo! Bravo!! 👏👏👏
YO THIS PROMO 🔥! The LDS chants were great!
Who on here thinks Cody Rhodes would make an excellent villain in the next Batman movie 🎥??
LDS = THE ROCK
The Rock acknowledged Romam Reigns as Tribal Chief, but he never said anything about Final Boss! You just know that The Rock, at some point, is going to request that Roman acknowledge him as The One True Final Boss of Wrestling...😂
Cody went surgical on Dwayne "the Rock Johnson! He went fire 🔥 and brimstone on him in a real calculated way. These promos between Cody and Rock are off the chain! Very, very good 👍 👏 👌 😀
Codycrybabies
Cody may just be the very first person to say heel on live tv and the lines between reality and scripture have become blurry
It’s good to know Cody can do a promo and not cry
Don’t say that boys 😅
Doesn't it feel in the promos that its Cody vs The Rock in the main event at Mania? Just a small criticism.
Cody's delivery is so boring
I smell a setup hitjob.
🈚️🈚️🙏🙏🤙🤙
enough with this clown and his little story.every wrestler has a story and most of them had a tougher story than this clown whos daddy helped  get him  into the business
This was uncensored like that? We are in a new era forsure. All we need is blood lol
what's with the piped-in crowd noise?  lame  Nice to see some fire from Cody, tho
This is just Cody being forced behind the scene to put men down and covertly pedestalizing modern women for PR.
He, still talking about that BS imaginary story...what ever tf that is😅
I love the tugging the curtains back . Keeps this up wrestling is fun again
Cody is on🔥 tonight, hope he keeps that energy at wrestlemania.
loved how Heyman said LADIES AND GENTLEMEN lol
This fu said we accept 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is like watching cena (rock) destroying Roman (Rhodes) on the mic
LDA is insane 🤣🤣
Lets be honest, only women use the line “LIL D*CC ENERGY” cody sounds like a soy boy feminist
Is it Roman vs Cody at wrestlemania or is it Cody vs rock at wrestlemania?
Does wwe delete the non-pg comments on this comment section…?
Smh just when I thought cody thodes couldnt be any weaker than he already is on the mic he proves it again, Rock is absolutely BURYING this overrated mid carder week after week and every response from cody can never match Rock’s promos, only Vir*ins and people who are around the age of 12 and people who just don’t have intelligence or common sense honestly think this guy can cut promos, did he just say the wwe didn’t need the rock?!? Lmao yea just like in 2011 right?? and cody also say  “LIL D*CC ENERGY” ?? Seriously?? Something only women say, literally only females use that line this guy is so feminine it’s literally a line women use when they’re mad at a guy 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
FINALLY we're getting uncensored content!!!
Audience cheers in little burst at the end of his sentences are weird...is that how they cheer now?
Cody boring asf.
Cody Rhodes: I think you're just Roman's side chick." 😐  Me: "Pulls out reverse card" You activated my Reverse card! 😐😂😂
Cody has no charisma how do these kids today get behind this fool?lol
I like that Cody is doing the promo material that I somewhat predicted would come to pass, Dwayne taking steroids and crying to his bosses "cough" crybaby.
Cody’s GREATEST PROMO OF ALL-TIME, hands down 😂
We all know this is staged and all that. But Cody’s promos with the bloodline have been cutthroat and awesome!
CODY IS COOKINNNNNN
Lame.   Cody ain’t it 😂😂😂😂.  Sorry.  He just isn’t
Paulrus 😂
Cody absolutely cooked in this promo, and proved how good of a heel he could be somewhere down the line
Just love Cody ❤
This promo is fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
If this was Street Fighter The Rock would be Bison. Cody roasted him good!!!!!
Like this Cody Rhodes about time somebody put the people drag queen in his place he been overrated
Someone tell Cody, The Rock is funny and entertaining, lame Cody is neither.
Cody is boring 🤣
This nd what The Rock posted a few days ago in his video have been amazing promos 👏 this is the WWF I mean E that I remember growing up 💯 I hope they keep this kind of content going ❤️
I like this Cody
NAH THE FACT THAT THIS WAS UNCENSORED WAS BEYOND ME 😭
2:00 Michael Cole almost laughing 😭
Thank god he didnt come out crying again. Enough..we need cody angry. The rock has been literally cooking him and rollins everyday.
Rock will always be a 🔥 on the mic but this response from Cody was amazing so much better what we’ve been getting these past couple of weeks
I have a feeling Netflix is gonna be NC 17
I feel like the rock gonna show up n make roman mad by doing so
Hunter just have a middle finger to Meltzer and the sheets with this one.
Paul needs to be bold.
TVMA
Cody was the only one crying and whining
What was that at #4:24?
Is the Rock and official member of the bloodline?
Cody reminding everyone that he is him and he’s like dat
😂LDS😂
LDS, LDS, LDS, LDS!!!
Cody is definitely going full homelander at WrestleMania
They are just letting Cody have freedom on that mic. Good stuff.
I see we’re addressing the hog in the room
"LDS". bro are we ushering in a new attitude era??
Bravo, Cody. Great promo.
Finally, no more PG
CODY COOKING
Two of the best on the mic 🎤
Something tells me LDS will be the new chant 😂
Best way to twist this is if Cody brings out the Bullet Club but I doubt it
Ive watched since 5 aka when shield came into wwe im almost 17
Paul can't rely on cowardly pigs
Cody won me over with this promo. Was sick of hearing him be nice. He got it going now.
I can already hear the LDS chants next time rocky shows up😂😂😂 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Will Seth use this as heel turn fuel against Cody? First, he turned down the title shot, then acted like he wasn't needed?
I think the PG gloves are off
Did he say salt of the earth?
Lmao Cody named name dropped Homelander
Cody promos are really good. The rock is really trying hard to sell WrestleMania. I see the rock turning on Roman Reigns and letting Cody win the title so they could face each other in another pay-per-view because Roman Reigns is leaving
Im glad pg eras mostly done
Oh Cody. Homelander is not a good guy.
Cody is the best on the mic since rock I late 90s early 2000's
Proof that AEW is the inferior product and complete fools for letting Cody go.
This dude cody is soo cringy and corny. Bruh I don't get why these kids like corny.
🤯🤯🤯🤯
LDS
So funny 😂and nice promo and good luck Cody at Wrestle Mania   this so funny lol but good promo
Bye bye PG WWE
“Nobody is bigger than the business.” Great promo by Cody, but that’s absolute cap! The Rock is bigger than the WWE. He never needed to comeback in 2011, they needed him.
Cody is getting jumped
the fed is so much better without VKM
Yall need to hop off Cody’s nuts my goodness
Wrestling is the best its been since the 90s.
If you don’t let Cody break Roman’s reign I will start a petition. Who is better? Who is better on the mic? He ran with this, and made it a story worth turning into. Only reason as a fan for 20+ years I still watch and keep up to date. Yall have a gem, don’t crush it.
WAITAMINUTE!!!!!!!!........ Go back to your Mom beating up an undercover cop at a Willie Nelson concert, we want to hear this one lol
Cody hasn't carried any promotion but talks a good game.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Cody’s fashion never fails 👏🏼
Let’s gooooo tv-14 promo
Cody say y’all not finna just let Rock cuss me out and I can’t respond
I think Seth should should be the 1 who beats Roman but heyyy
LDS LDS LDS LDS LDS LDS LDS LDS LDS LDS LDS LDS LDS LDS
(in the rocks voice) Finally the pg era has been put too rest!🎉🎉🎉
This is going to be the funniest thing in the world 🌎 because the Rock and Roman everybody smell what they’re cooking and what they’re cooking. Is this a big load of 🫵🤬💩💩💩💩💩
I don’t believe Paul Hamen. I can’t, would like to see Roman win 1 match without outside interference.
We all know the bloodline going to  come out of nowhere and attack him
We need heel Carlito back !
Trash
Yup RIP Cody 💀
…. Okay…? Cody is giving his response to Rock’s words then this message about a match… I feel like it will be a match either interrupted by the Rock or Rock will show up at the end of the match— possibly with the rest of the Bloodline in tow to assault Cody… WWE is pretty predictable… I am 99% positive of this…
Cody owned The Rock
I’m glad this is uncensored.
Horrible crowd
This is starting to become the Cody that fans ran out of AEW
Omg 😱 Cody brought fire 🔥 to his prom
CODYSTRONG!
BRA CODY RHODES TOP 5
absolute fire promo! this stuff makes me feel like a kid again, but in a good way. Not in the grounded/detention way, but in a $1.00 McChicken kind of way
I should be bloodline rules why wwe why
cody really brings it during wrestlemania season 😂
Finally pushing through pg .....
This is starting to backfire on Trips.  They could've just done a straight Cody v Roman Part 2 where Cody won.  That would've worked because most fans deep down still don't like Roman anymore than they years ago.  Problem now is that almost everyone loves the Rock... Every woman in the audience, including Brandi,  would jump him over Stardust.... you've noticed they cheered, then booed, and now are cheering him again... fans will always choose him over Cody... facts... and fans know that Dwayne will likely have to be carried through the tag match, but that doesn't matter.  His charisma Trump's the other talent in the ring
Cody’s clap back seems forced and cringe imo.
The next WWE champion.  Cody Rhodes.  ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
Cody better be ready. Lol.
1:13 Forever <3  Love how no matter where we are, the crowd will always remember the Nature Boy when there's a chop!
Feel like Roman is Roman's side chick in this feud
ROCKY ROCKY ROCKY ROCKY
Would of been better if he added “and I was a heel” 😂
The attitude era is back!!!!
Yes, WWE needed saving. Let's stick to the facts. Now WWE ratings are through the roof.
It would of been funny if LDS line was used in Salt Lake 😂
Best Cody promo ecer
Ever since the Rocks return, he has single handedly overshadowed Roman who? Does Rock run the island of revelancy?
Cody promo was good, it’s usually a snooze fest. This story is heating up.
Lds 😮
I’m just hearing a lot of “Imma Let My Fear Fuel Me” Row Dogg
Bro this promo is insane
cody is such a heel.
I hope they're finally getting rid at this PG s*** and going back to TV 14 and bringing back blood like it should be in the matches and Cody's promo was lit I love that part where he called The Rock LDS Haha😂😂😂😂
one step closer to seeing Cody in a Homelander costume😁
bro this promo was awesome. i feel like tv-14 is finally coming back
Black suit Cody is kinda rude and I like it
I am so glad PG is gone
Cody was cooking here
Cody's mom sounds like a badass!
It's gonna be a set up on smackdown against Rhodes they gonna jump him
Did Cody go there yes he did Cody cooked more in 3 mins then the blood line did in years
"Oh my gosh yes rock yes. Put on your Gucci shirt your muscles look so big it's  gonna be so great. Yes yes yes yes!" That had me howling 😂😂
don’t start crying when john cena number 2 become about
Cody's mom is Cuban. She ain't worried about the Rock lol
LDS 😅😅😅😅 this is attitude era for sure lol
Cody getting jumped on Friday
Brock should return at WrestleMania 40 and help cody win the universer chapion
I’m not a Cody fan at all he gets on my nerves Roman is better my opinion
After 3 boring minutes The Rock says you should know your role and SHUT YOUR MOUTH!!!
Ohhhhooo
The end 😱
😂😂😂LDS😂😂😂😂🎉
Why tf is Cody out here shaking the opposition hands JDfromny going to have a hay day tonight on his podcast at 10:30 tonight tune in
Hold on The Rock the heal in this story 🤨 ?
Rock has LDS shocking with all those steroids
This……is……a…….promo!
I know Heyman is lying🤨🤨
Nice homelander reference
Lmao 😂 this is ridiculously cringe
Cody its a trap either seth is going to set u up or something else is going to happen
Cody  just  made a deal with the  devil
He thinks Rock is an Athhole?? His lisp will always make him not a real top guy.
Cody was going crazy 😂😂
blurring the lines between reality and kayfabe is EXCELLENT booking and WHAT YOU WANT in professional wrestling
Is this the PG era? lol  Haha , I laughed when he said “I know ur mom too!” 😅 cool that he didn’t necessarily say anything against her in a negative way but rather joked about how his own mom whooped an undercover cop 😂😂😂
They really putting Roman in the backseat 😩
He could go even harder if he tried. "It's not just anybody who can single-handedly destroy an entire super-hero movie shared universe! And there's so many franchises left to kill. Rock could be the new voice of Groot over at Marvel. When it comes to movies, he's used to Vin Diesel's sloppy seconds!" The promo writes itself.
I hope Cody loses just to upset the fans.     Then injures The Rock and the Tribal Chief vacating the title.
For those of you who missed it, WELCOME TO 70's and 80's Babyface heat promos.  THIS GUY IS TALKING PEOPLE INTO SEATS!
Bruh this dude just does not have the cool factor Jesus Christ. No wonder all anyone is talking about the past 3 months is the rock
Cody, your friends with Michael Cole? 😂😂😂
PG era is over, thankfully
Don’t understand how people hate Cody, he’s so good in the ring and on the mic
Cody Rhodes use John Cena promo into ruthless aggression
The fans gonna turn on cody at mania😂
Cody Rhodes better than Roman reigns
that wasnt a roast, cody went nuclear on rocky
Impressive cody
LDS😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
this promo is just golden ❤️🔥🔥🔥
Woah
even i know roman will never show up by him self bloodline going be some where hiding and jump cody by himself cody have some back up please
Dwaynarhea Johnson
This is American Nightmare we needed 🇱🇷💀
lol Paul wasn’t about to let Cody call The Rock Roman’s side chick, he wanted it known right then and there he’s Roman’s side chick
Ywgo vns🔥🖕🔥🖕🔥🖕🎤
It’s amazing how a little cussing can go a long while
THIS WAS IT? THIS WAS HOW HE RESPONDED???!!!   Man's wore all black to his own funeral. This promo was MID AF
Yes this is what we want to see Cody get Savage f****** and nice❤ this is the cody we need to see at wrestlemania😊
Now remember he said nobody from the Bloodline will be there, which means Ted Dibiase Jr. will show up and try to f*ck on Cody.
Cody Rhodes has come so far. This is the same dude who came in as Dashing Cody Rhodes, and the guy who was Stardust. We went from that, to this. Cody Rhodes is an A-lister.
Lol......... Christian Cage sitting back watching the wrestling World imitate him lol
Where’s Roman??
We are truly witnessing wrestling history
No more PG era 😂😂!
I guess the kids can’t watch Raw anymore. 😄
I think it's looking like there bringing back the cussing in wwe
LDS is serious 😂😂
He should of just had said I’m gonna be your final boss instead of calling him a side chick Cody would of not had survive a lunch table roast session .
Can yall just fight already 🙄
Ngl this reminds me of the Authority.😅😅😅
I hadnt watched wrestling since I was in highschool in the early 2000's. This story line has me hooked. Great performances by all involved!
I don't think Paul was telling the truth hopefully Seth is in the audience or something to help Cody if Paul was lying
Cody came out in his black suit, ready for a funeral
Crlstlaln 🔥🦴🔥🦴🔥🦴🔥🎤
I dont like cody. But he did a good promo
That's a setup. Trust me, roman may come alone, but Jimmy and Solo would be there  also
*R-Truth watching this:* now I *KNOW* that wasn’t pg.👀
It felt disjointed because Paul came out there I just don't get any fire from Cody right now
This is AEW Cody
Soap opera at its finest
The era of PG is seemingly over. And its phenomenal.  Finally
I can't wait to watch the match
Up until this promo, I didnt see what everybody saw in him. I didnt like him in 39. Didnt think being #30 in last years RR, wasnt heroic or nothing. But he spewed out a sharp blade tonight. Great promo. Go Cody.
Love you Cody Rhodes
cody is cringe
Stepping up your game Cody 👍🏿👏🏿
I guess gone are the pg13 days thankfully!
can't take it serious
He should have called The Rock a Pebble.
Very sharp suit  .. good color!
Anyone who wears that freedom flag shirt is like cidy rhodes sahd rock was .
Cody rhodes is nothing compared to the rock. Nothing. I cant wait til he loses and this storyline is over.
“If you will”
4:36 Cody's Mom did what now?
Cody Trash
This rivalry has given us such amazing roasts and segments in the past few weeks. What a blessing.
Did he just say... SALT OF THE EARTH?!
Only Marks takenCody seriously
I can see all the 'LDS' signs at Wrestlemania now. 😂😂😂
Netflix is on deck.
5:55 Cody Rhodes' uncensored promo has brought himself some Attitude when he calls The Rock a "Little D**k Syndrome" 🔥🔥🔥
Cody so corny
I feel like Cody has been talking to a certain former AEW champ a little before this promo. Some of those lines felt very MJF.
And this is pro wrestling. This is what we all fell in love with. And this is what brought me back. Thank you.
Finally 😩 Cody hit back
Cody's best promo by far. A little bit of profanity is perfect. Happy to see Cody progress
Cody is smoking with the black suit with his jabs and insults. BUST OUT THE BLACK SUIT MORE OFTEN. Black suit : Badass Cody Rhodes
Rock. LDS
Look at wwe getting grown!
Cody boring this the best he can do . Rock been cooking him and Seth
Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Black Suit Cody is Goat Tier
Cody Rhodes is awesome
Cant wait to see CM Punk go on mic without the PG.
I like Cody. But he comes across dry sometimes.
LDS !!
The Rock has Small D energy!
Glad we out of the pg era
NOOOOO CODY GETTIN SET UP THIS FRI
Cody didn’t hold back on this promo pure fire 🔥
gonna be funny when yall see he can’t carry the belt
Ain’t no way Cody’s trusting this they’re obviously gonna try to attack him from the crowd
Sure would be a shame if Toma Tonga showed up.
TRIPLE H can we get the TV-14 rating back please
LET CODY COOK😂🔥
This dude is so cringe on the mic.
Cody is cookin
Cody speaking facts
Bros giving that black airforce 1 energy with that black suit🔥
This run is putting Paul over Bobby henan as the best manager ever
Acknowledged the homelander influence
I would say we just entered the AttiTWOude era.
I think we can all agree Cody's mom never beat anyone up. Let alone someone who'd have legal authority to get away with defending himself.
Cody Rhodes will finish the story at wrestlmaina 40
God this guys awful lol. Can't wait for the Rock come back and boost the entertainment value back to wwe. This guy is a snooze fest
Rock is Roman reigns side chick 😂😂😂😂
Finally Cody gets to be unleashed and cut the great promos he can do. And someone gets to bury The Rock back 😂 it’s about time they stop making Cody look weak and being the nice guy smiling while being made to look like a fool. Hopefully this is the start of a return to more edgy shows again.
Just like last year, Cody hitting his stride with these promos leading up to Wrestlemania.
Folks I think we can definitively say the PG era is over
Bro came out in the equalivent of Black Air Forces with the black suit and shirt.  Fire promo
A whiny one some would say dis guy cooking
I do I have this funny feeling some 2:48  backstabbing is going to happen on smackdown against Cody Rhodes! Have eyes 👀 in the back of your head Cody! Jamie 😊
Where is CM Punk
Yes cody get in that bag 😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can’t get over the lisp.
Jimmy duggan  "She's crying sir" 😂
That was fn awesome. Finally no more PG BS.
attitude era is back!
I’m sorry but this Cody is so much better. Let him be like this more.
When I was young I used to cry when I had nightmares. Now I'm crying tears of joy
LOL, I can't believe Cody says LDS on national television!🤣🤣🤣
Cody was just going wild on Rock! That promo was just Homelander level!
Lou Costello 💡
It's a trap
Was Cody allowed to say that???????😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Do you think cody will show you alone on smakedown yes he will but he will also have back up. Roman show up along no he will have the blood line there i  Guarantee that one Roman can't do anything without the blood line
LDS lmao
Roman needs to lose at wrestlemaina
Love the black suit red tie great look
Loving the language in these promos
🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌🙌🙌🔥🔥🔥🔥
The PG Era is over!
NEVER TRUST PAUL HEYMAN.  JUST BECAUSE  THE BLOODLINE SUPPOSEDLY WON'T BE THERE THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE JUDGEMENT DAY WON'T. CODY YA BETTER HAVE A BACKUP PLAN IN CASE THE JUDGEMENT DAY SHOWS UP
This passes as a "fire promo" these days? 🤣🤣🤣
They been cursing a lot lately WWF IS BACK!
We need Rock vs Orton!
OK CODY!!!!  NOT BAD BRO!!!
Cody just made a deal with the devil
Cody’s biggest obstacle is gonna be …what’s next after Mania? So much time and effort has been put into this story that it’s no way higher than this bloodline story.
Cody just scorched earth this is WWE as it was meant to be
✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿
Hopefully it ain't No Set Up which it prolly Is..
I'm if it's just me thinking that Cody is slowly going heel but everyone is still loving him
This guy is so bad
LDS Diarrhea Johnson 😂
He going to see the head of the table on smackdown and I guess he going to be smacking him around😮
pg era MIGHT be over
Pg wrestling is done 🫡  I like it
Do you guys think this is gonna be a trap On smack down.
Those crowd noises seem too loud.. is it only me?
7:29 the bald dude behind heyman 😂😂😂
Finally grew some balls & cut a decent promo for once
Austin returns at Wrestlemania..lays out the bloodline with a steel chair and saves Cody. Just like he did at Backlash when he took out Mchanon and Triple H regime 😂
Paul Heyman just smiled at the end lol 💀😂
Hot Take🔥  Cody Rhodes looks like Virgil from Devil May Cry..... LOL
Hey Nick Khan! Don’t think Cody got your memo about keeping things PG.
If only cody could cut a promo half as good as the Rock.
This is better then the crying last week, gotta give em that lol
A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE SAYING Cody hasn't earned it last year this year is different this year he has definitely earned it
Cody Rhodes roasted the Rock with a Promo like no other 😂😂😂
You call the rock a “heel” and then accept that deal thinking they’ll honor it?
Wrestlemania has become more about Cody and Rock instead of Cody and Roman.  I don’t think Roman likes this very much 🤔.
Cody crybabies
Look at the ratings Cody you sure do need saving
Can't get passed Cody's LISP
I don't like the looks of this
he may show up alone, doesn't mean he'll end up alone. nor did he get a guarantee from any of the other members
Wow the road to WrestleMania is interested and awesome
If you want to step in this ring be my guess
"If you smell, what the final boss is cookin'."
Dang Cody went hard in the paint with this promo❤❤ love it
CMON CODY!!
Salt of the Earth, eh???
Bro used a forbidden term “Heel”
Wow lol, lds
The Rock is Roman Reigns side chick😂😂😂
Cody is straight cooking the rock!!!
I guess the superstars won the argument of if the rock çan cuss, then we can
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
i love this!!!!! cody cody cody
Drew McIntyre 8:04  and Roman Reigns showing up alone as that one song said "For the first time in forever"
They better turn Cody heal after wrestlmania. He's getting boring/repetitive as a face
Oh my god the entire bloodline plus the rock are going to jump Cody Rhodes this Friday I can already feel it
I feel a trap this Friday
LDS 😂 the attitude era is back!!!!
ATTITUDE IS BACK!!!!
He called Jericho a carnie succubus
Cody Rhodes 🇺🇸
The rock Great good going dwayne johnson
The Rock will show up
This is what we needed from Cody!!!!!!!!!!-
Cody Rhodes be quiet already please
Cody is On  🔥 🔥. He  being out The Best!
Stirring up pretty well but Rock still rules on mic
It’s crazy this promo was uncensored 💀💀💀
Everybody calling each others mom to get the green light to talk about each othef before promos haha
The Black and Red Cody era
Rhodes called it like it is 😂💯
Lds lol. Great promo by Cody
cody can do his promos live, while the rock has to film his and upload it on the internet, really shows a lot
Cody could honestly take about just anyone on the mic. He deserves to be champion after carrying the company
Best promo from cody Tonight 🔥
Cody cooked tonight
It’s about time!!! 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
A buzz killer when an actor in a movie breaks the 4th wall. I feel the same about wrestling. So cringe when he went on a little tangent mentioning the term "heel" multiple times. I hope he never does that again.
It's official! We out the PG Era!! They ain't censoring nothing no more, I guess.
What’s crazy is it’s his best promo and it’s still boring.
😮 L.D.S.
They really pushing Cody to the moon this WM.  Crazy good promo
They didn’t even censor the swear like what is happening!? Fire promo too
He about to get jumped 😂  The rock going to go against orders and Roman is going to hold him accountable or at least try to the following smack down and the rock not going to show up 😂 Mark my words  I’m screenshotting this 😅
Shiii🔥🔥 Cody unlocking that cena face aggressive promos he been lacking, that “so what do you wanna talk about” with a smile after losing mania 39 was pathetic, this aggression is what he needed
I love how WWE has been breaking the fourth wall with this whole feud. This is the best TV WWE has put on in a very long time.
It's diff a trap. Roman never shows up alone
I LOVE the shade being thrown at the... *ahem* "old ownership" with saying that we all understand insider terms. It's about time.
LDS 😂
Cody bringing all the lumber on this promo.
Nah Dwayne is cooked
This feud has been more about Rock and Cody as opposed to Roman vs Cody lol
Finally cody rhodes put the rock in check
Love wwe 🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤
Look at this car salesman try to talk
Those pumped in audience noises need to stop🤦🏾
Corny
Cody Rhodes aka Cody cry babies grand wizard
GET EM, CODY! GET EM!!!
I love this new Cody ❤❤😊❤❤
THERE WE GO CODY! Talk that talk back! I love it❤ and this is coming from a rock fan week after week where hes been killin yall in his segments. You did great with this one cody! 😂 love it!
Cody really went all out with this one. Can't wait to see him finish the story! 🙏🏽
Cody Rhodes truly became Homelander tonight! Let's go Cody!
So I’m guessing Cody was one of the ones in the backstage complaining about Rock cussing and he couldn’t lol I like the AEW throwback with the Homelander line.
Cody Rhodes is a savage, the Rock gets Roasted by the American Nightmare. That's all right, In Wrestlemania Night 2, Cody Rhodes will Defeat Roman Reigns for the WWE Undisputed Championship. That's the best Promos ever.
Cody cry baby 🍼..... nobody wants to see Cody vs Roman two time in a row at wrestle mania. Roman will end the cry babies story.. Cody he look like the lady from Halloween 🎃🤣
I love that they're now able to acknowledge the term HEEL on TV
LDS is crazy 💀💀💀
What Dwayne did Friday was just in poor taste. He just shows what kind of person he truly is, as, and will always be. A sad attempt to be famous
The Homelander line🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ohk this is good but lets talk about montez and dawkins how karrison kross is playing it out
Now this right here was a good comeback. The LDS Part 😂
The Rock’s response on this upcoming SmackDown might be predictable at best.
The promo was good 🔥🔥🔥
Cody said that The Rock is Roman side chick 😂😂😂
RIP PG!!🤣🤣🤣🎤❤️🤍🖤
Who is a Cody cry baby or rock
This was an absolute FIRE promo I loved it, things are heating up even more
