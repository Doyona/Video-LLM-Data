Hook = his son.  Bars = himself.
Gotta keep this man's safe bangers after bangers
🔥🔥💯
I'm not big on hotboii but I fw this song and a few of his features, you know a rapper is real and genuine when they can talk about their family life and not hide it because they don't wanna show their "soft side" but really it just proves they're hard  and don't give a fuck what people think, respect.
Yb had  his kid on the song first
🔥🔥🔥
Okay. One of my second favorite rapper Hotboi 🔥🔥🔥🔥💯🔥
hotboii the shit 2022 is hotboii year
