Great mov I want a 2nd❤❤❤
Chaos walking is a trilogy. The books have so much information. It's unfortunate that they choose to try and force it all into one movie.
It got mostly bad reviews, but I liked it.
If the world ends, a few days just bros before would be alright 😂
What movie is this?
Tuff
Spiderman and Rey.
Кой е замесен?Анджелина,русата Блонди курва?Боян?Пламена?Кой е поставил това нещо в главата ми?Разрушиха ми живота😱
Que pesima historia, me dio asco 🤮... y como siempre un libro que se convirtió en tres... en serio es uno de los libros más tediosos que he visto
1:27-1:28-1:29
is it just me or did this film come out with zero marketing or hype ?
This film was fuckin dog piss 🗑️🚮
On which platform I can see?
>Daisy Ridley >Tom Holland Couldn't have made it any clearer this was nothing more than a tax write off.
Stupid music
This movie is an absolute masterpiece. I loved it from the start and every step of the way I continued to love it more and more. I have to put this one in my top 10 all time favorites
Of course, the only woman who can save human extinction is a blonde woman. There's never a shortage.
In 1991, coalition forces bombed a bridge in Baghdad, and part of it remained. I walked on it and it was the same scene.
WTH this is so bad compared to the books its like eating golden steak and finally getting offered something you have been waiting  for only to eat a bowl of fucking cockraches.......
One of the worst movies I ever watched.
That was a shield you just destroyed. Enjoy hell
Oh my god I just said “how was this posted 4 years ago this was 2021 that was only like 9months/1 ago”
Alguém sabe o título em português?
This movie was sooooo good Wish I heard about it back when it came out
Movie was mostly boring and had no main story to it
Crazy how bad they fumbled this with that cast, always thought this should have been a series instead since so much happens in the AMAZING book, it's a mess when crammed into a movie
very bad movie 😮‍💨
Mads Mikkelsen should’ve been in the headline
chaos walking part 2? i want to see more about the ship! Sadly not happen.
What a misleading trailer.  The protagonist does not get stronger at all thoughtout the movie.  She had no power either, and he did not harness it..  I wanted to know more about the indegenious aliens.  To bad we were stuck with lame actors.  They did Daisy dirty.  She is no 5 element.
I loved this movie  right up until the idiot director felt the need to delete poor Manchee, I can never show my wife this movie.
Never even heard of this movie, wow.. interesting concept
Awful movie. Horse dies. Dog is murdered by a maniac. And pointless drama. Do not recommend.
I saw this a couple of years ago, but it keeps popping up on my Google searches for some reason (recent comments from Daisey Ridley I guess). I don't remember every detail, but vaguely remember it was similar to Let Him Go, where two actors that seemingly should fit so well together didn't do much for a not-so-great film. It was okay. I think I thought at the time that it could have used a sequel to flesh out the story and characters more.
if all mens thoughts were on display this world would be safer
This movie lines up with the philosophy of the yugas as described by spiritual savant Sri Yukeswars book The Holy Science.  These psychic abilities increase or decrease according to the yuga you are born into. This movie would be in the Treta yuga=The mental age. We are currently in the beginning of the Dwarpara yuga on an ascending spiritual evolutionary trajectory for the next 10k years.
I never heard of this movie until today!!! Watched it on Hulu!  It was so good! 😮
What a great surprise. No wonder Alpha Male Queens are upset.
One of my favs❤
What a stupid concept
Watched it and thought it filled every minute of screen time. Just a great idea for fiction (sci-fi) and excellent timing of sci-fi props. Tuned in because I know about Mads, but must point out that Miss Daisy and Mr. Tom painted it perfect, and the director will not force you to swim in love-quicksand syrup. Could have watched a whole season of this one.  Just have to add that it is so much fun when you wish the movie had been a little longer.
This is bull****. Men think about sex by minutes. This series would be a cacophony of porn thoughts.
Felt vibes like Raised by Wolves. RIP to this mind-blowing sci-fi 💔
Nunca se pone el traje de spiderman?
Remember peeps, if someone likes your pet, they are a friend.
Tom Holland please continue the Spiderman with Venom pls hehe
He left the dog for a bxtch, what a loser.
This movie was so bad. It is specially sad, cause the book is based on is amazing. What a waste.
❤❤❤
i dont care what he says i am not i am todd hewitt i am 99% sure.
A town full of gay people and their leader are out to get me help.
Muy mala
Anyone else think it be more like pornhub constantly playing in the background? lol
Looks spooky!
Is this based on the book the knife of never letting go by Patrick Ness?
How did I not know about this COOL MOVIE 🤩
"I like your dog." 😂😂😂
THE WRITER MURDERS A DOG THIS BROUGHT BACK MY CHILDHOOD TRAUMA WHEN SOMEONE TRIED TO DROWN MY DOG. ID LOVE TO SUE THIS WRITER. MY WHOLE DAY HAS BEEN OF ANGER AND HATE THANKS TO THAT SCENE.
I love that Tom Holland is meant to be 13 in this.
This is the copy of maze runner?????
Time wasting movie😣😣
this is not how i imagined it when i read the chaos walking trilogy.  edit: it still looks good though, will try to find the film
I literally just found out my favourite book series as a teenager has a movie, and i also just found out it was poorly received and not considered a good movie.  Heartbreaking.
wow
Spiderman as Mysterio be like:
It’s a lot to sit through constant chatter all that add’l noise it’s been weeks and I haven’t finished this one yet lol
I havnt watched a single movie in 8 yrs, stuff like this reminds me i'm not missing much. And if movies wernt already bad enough, the pandemic royally screwed the art of movie making. When you go yrs without seeing one, the trailers seem so... Idk its weird. Makes me feel like dissociation, and reminds me I spent most of my life being a daily tv watcher. I loath fiction now, I still have a wild imagination, but i get more satisfaction from creating than consuming.
True cinematic gold with Hollywoods best Talented individuals never before seen in a writhing fiction of comedy; deciet; inquiry; seat of your pants 🔥☄️🧯wow honestly I think Siskel 🆙
This movie needed Kevin Bacon
I DID NOT KNOW THIS MOVIE EXIST! mads, tom, daisy!
Nah no one who ruined Star Wars thanks
All my intrusive thoughts on display.... Yeah, that sounds horrible.
Appropriate title.
Movie should be called snitching that’s all everybody did was fucking snitch I couldn’t even finish it
The USA movies have to keep that English stupid accent out of them. Because of that girl with that damn accent, this movie lost a lot. People like the American accent. Keep it. Americans are tough and strong. Once I heard that girl with that accent,  I was about to stop watching this movie. And I didn't watch it until the end.
Was a decent movie with an original plot. Would've been better imo as a horror movie, rated 15 or 18.  People have crazy thoughts. If we could see each others thoughts, it would be anarchy 🤣. Just random thoughts of sex or violence popping up every time you meet someone.
Okay... but the fact that Tom and Mads are both part of the Marvel universe and Daisy and Mads are both a part of the Star Wars universe and now they all just acted in a movie together seems pretty epic in its own right.
Please Bring Dormamu & Mads Mikelsten back in...  Doctor Strange 3
0:14
Cover it up with movies.
The dog😢
We can't lie in this Planet
Sorry i spent 15$ to watch this movie.  90% of it was filmed in the woods. Budget had to be under 3 million.  My whole life had been decided to TV and movies. Over 164,000 hours. I enjoyed my life.
i remember reading the book back in secondary school and 6 years ago and i imagined it exactly like this in my head
Overthinkers would be weapons of mass confusion 😂😂 just drop 10 of them in a crowd and everything goes wild

Название фильма помоему поступь хаоса
Waaaaacccckkkkkkkkk
Not even Mads mikelsem could save this movie.
Even the trailer is boring. What a mess.
How would they reproduce?
This is every pot heads nightmare… coz they are the ones experiencing NOISE 😅 this is the reason why people are afraid to smoke 😅
Why the imdb is 5.7 only
I was pissed when preacher killed the dog. Why must they add that in there? Todd Hewitt should have already had enough animosity built up after finding out the truth about his mother and all the women so why was it necessary to kill his dog
🤷 dobrze się zapowiadał ale niestety szału nie ma...
WHY DID THEY KILL MANCHEE 😭😭😭😭 He didnt deserve that
If I ever ended up on that planet, I would be killed on site.
wtf
Looks like poo
This movie just felt like a massive waste of time.
The fuck is this concept, absolutely retried.
If the only female on this planet is a blonde, at least she could have been a real blonde. Daisy Ridley is a brunette.
the villain is what is making me interested in watching this....pretty boy ralph and hotters girl are to repetitive in movies
an alien planet with trees and plants that look exactly like thee ones we have here on earth. lol, uhhh, nope. This looks dumb af
Dull movie
Mancheeee😢😢😢
Anyway, I just want to say. We have been wasted so many resources and money in female.They take everything from us , from people.
I think if every female leave this planet permanently. There should be enough food for everyone. No more hunger.
I swear to god. I will not give birth to female. This world doesn’t need those heartless things. I will be brave to drag the thing out of me and eat it to save the world.
Anyone else found it stressful to watch this? Just dealing with my own thoughts is draining enough lmao.
brilliant movie...
Why did the dog have to die..?
I just watched it isn't awful but 5 out of 10 you won't sleep or feel like you're wasting your precious time but you'll not be amazed and that'll not become your best movie ever. The problem of this kinda movie (the same for horror movies) is you watched it already 20 minutes and you got everything that'll happen even if you have only a brain cell.
chaos walking จิตปฏิวัติโลก (close as walk on was kin จำทิศ ปฏิบัติทิศ วางลมโชก)
The book is 1000 times better, if you can, read it.
A finally! Rey meets Kallus and Galen Erso in the realm of death!
irl it is demonically or rf induced schizophrenia.
Qué mala es, Dios mío!
Dam has anyone watched the movie yet ?
I hope the horse is okie.. Whiskey.. OMG
Omg I read the books of Chaos walking and i literally loved them💖 Tom Holland is playing my favourite character from the books😍
Daisy Ridley??? . She made the ending comfortable with one yep.🙂 . Besides having a big head, she's a great comfort to watch.... . I bought a comfy recliner for this movie... . I've only seen Star Wars, and this. Tom, is his name???? Good actor.
Looks weird!
Daisy Ridley just looks bored throughout most of the movie.
Nick
Good to see that in 2257 that cars don't exist, nor fast fashion, or TV shows.  But sad to see that violence is still around.  I was hoping for a more peaceful world.  I guess humans will never learn.
SPOLIER: "men are bad. Women are wonderful."  It's okay to study gender theory and to hate men, but trying to hammer talking points from a gender theory seminar into a movie script doesn't make it entertainment. It's still comes across as political indoctrination. That's too bad because both Holland and Ridley are good actors so they deserve a better script. Maybe younger audiences who have gone or are going through school curricula steeped in gender theory find this a good movie. Also a move costing 100 million $ to make should look better and the landscape didn't look alien at all. I mean the movie Alpha set in the Stone Age also cost 100 million $ but it looked fantastic and I really felt transported to another era. Director Doug Liman isn't even mentioned in this trailer description.
Its taking everything i have to stick with this.
the bookes were so much better omfg
I don’t feel like viola is write
saddest scene that stupid man drowning the poor pup. I almost cried but due to the fact that i havent been able to cry for about a month i didnet
Just saying, if someone killed my dog like that, I would torture that person slowly until death.
I was planning on watching the movie but after this trailer earraped me I'm having second thoughts
I wonder when it will be out on Netflix? When?! I need to know! '
FRAGMAN İYİ FAKAT FİLM REZALET. İZLEMEK İÇİN ZAMAN HARÇAMAYA ASLA DEĞMEZ 👎
Took long enough! A spin off to the movie What Women What that stared mel Gibson.
I’m sure the book is good but this movie doesn’t look good
Copyrighted
I appreciated the cheeky feminist warning about the patriarchy's wilful emotional stupidity in this movie, but it would have been better if the homoeroticism between Ben and Cilian was cemented in a beautiful farewell kiss.
is that spider sense?
Please, let the dog live though 🙏🏼
Couldn't finish it it was that bad.
It’s an amazing demonstration of how twisted “kindness” can be used to train someone or anyone in HATE. Simply incredible. Wow! I’ve been through two audiobooks now it’s about Love yes and about how leaders can bend the minds of youth to try and and break that love between a young man and woman. Will it survive? Get the books and find out is all I will say! What a stupendous trilogy. Sure has been holding me to the edge of my seat!
rEAD THE BOOK
NOT BAD
Chaos is an dwarf planet candidate that's far away from the sun the chaos planet need to orbit the sun to finish it and I have a lot of speakings about planets because I know planets
Oh god not this movie
Anyone else who read the book not imagine the sparkle looking like that 😅😅

This includes characters such as Mayor Teal and Police Commissioner Anderson as well as the Llewellyn brothers, their hired assassin named Gamble, Mob boss Carmine Tango and highly connected army officials.  1-15: The first section of the series involves a series of political hits performed by X, sometimes in tandem with a woman named Diana Gorreti, who wanted to take over Arcadia from mobster Carmine Tango. It is eventually revealed that X used Goretti to remove Tango and put pliable people in positions of power within the city. To this end, a "War" was fought between X and the mob, during which X was briefly thought killed by a mysterious mind controlling villain named Lord Alamout. 16-20: X travels to Washington D.C. to let the government know that he is in control of Arcadia and to try to extend his influence. During the trip to D.C., X encounters a general who seems to know something about X's early past. It is also revealed that X arrived in Arcadia as a young man, rapidly recovering from burns that covered much of his body and with no clear memories. He fell in love with his case worker who was involved with another man, Carmine Tango. X tried to kill Tango which amused him, so he took X in and pushed the case worker out of both of their lives. 21-25: Gamble, the only man X failed to kill after marking, returned and drew X into the open by inviting a rash of killers into Arcadia. Assistant D.A. Elizabeth Treaty spends some time building a case against X. Coffin returns just as X busts up Gamble's operations, saves Christie and marks McCone, one of the killers. The General explains that as a young military officer, he was sent in to search the area of a bombed scientist's lab and his arm was infected. The arm was amputated, but would not die and was eventually stolen. X finally recalls how he lost faith in everything he grew up believing, the day his father and mother were killed in front of him by men from the government. His father, before dying, injected him with a serum from an arm in a tank. As X recovers from a wound, the General realizes that the key to X's invulnerability is that his blood analyzes and repairs itself. Coffin arrives and rips the general in two, before being defeated by X, who also kills Gamble. At the end of the series, Treaty grants X full immunity.       WHOLE MOVIE SCRIPT IS NOW COMPLETE AND FOREVER OVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.     star cast for X (Dark Horse Comics)-------Andrew Lincoln as X    Budget-----------$60–66 million  Box office-------$99.8 million                   (((((8.8/10 IMDb 90% Rotten Tomatoes 4.7/5 Vudu)))))           ratings must be please thhis becoz i am challenging for this movie title.               Genres CrimeDramaMysteryThriller must always be there         WEAREMAKINGITADEATHCOMPANYMOVIEBYPUSHINGMONEYORPRODUCINGITANDWEHAVEAUTHORITYFORTHISTOOOFDARKHORSEcomicsMYNAMEISLUVFIESTA,GAMBIT(NICKNAME),HARLEYQUINN(PEOPLECALLMETHATTOO)IWANT20%CREDITSFORTHISGHOSTWRITERPROJECT,yes20%CREDITSPLEASEGIVETOLUVFIESTA,GAMBIT(NICKNAME),HARLEYQUINN(PEOPLECALLMETHATTOO).
Part two:all the men on the planet are dead and only women left.And all their thoughts are shown outside.
Is this the film of the book series?
After totally forgetting the source material, they aren't allowed to even call the movie Chaos Walking.
Why the hell did I get this ad in 2022?
Interesting concept.
I am Todd Hewitt
Flop
Looks lame af
OMG I cannot belive this book became a movie, I would have watch it!
It was a great movie, but it had so much potential to be turned into a series or even a trilogy, they missed out on so much material from the books
This Book is a Book
I reckon this world would benefit from Occulumency.
In part of the trailer, I can't tell if Tom Holland is trying to do a southern accent or if it's his English accent
What a terrible ending
Why does Daisy have to be blonde? How does that affect the plot? Which male decided that?
When did he make this movie? Lol
Good video
I hate the modern world. Everyone is weird af. Super fanatics and eager to celebrity worship. Everyone in the comments saying absolute every dumb thing you can think of besides if the movie is actually worth watching or not 🤦🏾‍♂️
the reason for the memories on this topic is not only the night and morning fires in the area where the settlers landed, and the often occurring video noise in the head, which is used to produce the necessary and understandable things with such a disease of multiple leg fractures, then the legs of large tuna, of course, keep steps, but you need to create like prostheses ... and a city under water then we will explain sleep in suspended animation in underwater glass cities - barracks for the sake of fuel volume and a supply of rocket hydrogen .. and transport restoring the legs of the first wave of settlers is also understandable ..
It looks confusing not sure if I’d like it or love it
I read two books of the trilogy and i found out that it's a film too just now.....2 years later🥲
I would thrive on this planet  My head is a void
Duuude this Looks sick
NOPE
Wanna watch this for mads
Filme ruim da desgraça
Reminds me of the Sci Fi Channel very bad sci fi movies. 300 years in the future and no cell phones, robots, electronics, etc. A bunch of muscular bums that never shave riding through the woods on horses going crazy over 1 girl. I walked away, my girlfriend liked it, but then she likes Bravo "reality" shows.
I Came here cause Tom gets fully Naked 👍
Where is bb8?
Was really good, i wished they kissed at the end and rip to a king
Looks like a 'I'll read the book instead' kinda movie.
I started reading The Knife Of Letting Go a week ago and just found out about this
I want the 2nd movie!!! Now!!! I just watched it and I don't think its over
I wonder Why Viola never got to kiss Todd?
Que clase de escritores sádicos matan a un perrito en la película y de una forma tan horrible.
nice movie
I liked it but why did they rush to the ending and not finish the story. This was a premature film.
Tom Holland dressed up as Uncharted Nathan Drake.
Bruhhhh. The knife of never letting go is my favorite book series ever. I was hoping they would make it into a movie. And now that they are, I'm so excited
Give it up Tom Holland, you're just not fit to play serious roles.
I'd be dead the first second of this movie cuz I think like a million things
spiderman and rey
What's chaos walking actually?
Lemmie guess, this film has full marks in ticking all the safe boxes.
Why Holland looks so young
L film
Think about the true message here.... without women we would develop super powers
Tom Holland ❤️
An incredible film with amazing performances from Daisy Ridley and Tom Holland.
Chaos Walking looks like Uncharted 2022 movie.
I watch This On HBO Last December on Cignal Cable in Philippines. It was a truly masterpiece and a great movie to watch ❤️🔥 .
This movie Tamil dubbed available ahh bro 🤔
Why is movie rated so low? I really really liked it
This spider-sense is tingling too much, on everyone.
I wish I could say that the commercials for this were ubitant but I didn't see them enough :(. Just kind of annoying
What a terrible movie.
spiderman testing out is new spider senses on a new planet?
It’s Tom Holland Spider-Man.
Loved the movie despite Todd Ewitt constant noise. Great concept.
Never thought I would see Spider-Man and the daughter of Palpatine in a movie
I actually really liked the movie but the feminist stuff is just noise …

The fact that the movie ends and she never gives him the kiss he dreamed of since he first saw her lol
All the thoughts of men on display??? Welp, I might as well walk around naked.
Today saw this 📽movie~  Very good👍👍😀
This doesn't seem legal  to have two of these together but ill take it!
Holy fucking shit. I was _JUST_ on reddit about to make a post about how I couldn't remember the name of this book series as I read it so long ago. A few google searches later and I find out they're making a movie!!! I can't believe it...I'm always telling my bf about all the books I've read that would make good movies, and this was definitely one of them. I am absolutely blown away
All the best people in one movie together
Wtf , she literally didn't kissed him at last...I am so so angry ;(
It's just like my OCD but good thing here is no one hears my thoughts.  Thank God!
Trash
Such a good movie
Todd and viola are supposed to be 12/13... why can't they cast other more unknown actors for a change instead of seeing the same faces over and over again in everything?
A dog dies. Don’t watch it. It’s honestly not worth it especially because of that scene.
Damn daisy ridley is like 10 times hotter blonde
release date?
Its starting is like ben 10
I’m Peter by the way  Rey Skywalker  Oh where using made up names I’m Spider-Man then
I can tell this movie will suck compared to the books. 3 books in one movie, that’s gonna be hard to do
Just watched it. 100% garbage. Please for the love of God, don’t waste your time. Don’t believe me, it cost 100 million to make and grossed 25 million. Opening weekend drew 4 million. Having seen it I can’t believe the budget was anywhere 100 mill. Barely any special effects. Bunch of crap with them running through a forest on another planet that was clearly a tree farm on earth. Less than pathetic.
I just watched the movie and loved it! Also, Daisy and Tom are my favorites, so happy to watch them together in a movie.  “I am Todd Hewitt… I am Todd Hewitt”
The 1st Simp Human Colonist
there is a book?  i am so not reading that
does the Dog die though, not watching it incase lol
Oh, this was an amazing movie btw.
FINALLY A NEW MOVIE CONCEPT (NO SURPRISE IT CAME FROM A BOOK) 📚🤍
Well that turned into a pile of dog poo.
Great movie, would recommend to anyone! :)
Best pt of the move was at the end , when Todd woke up , I was like ok the 40 men who killed the women would be trialed, or the indigenous species would be introduced finally ..... but noooooo none of that , what happen to the Jonas brother that was the antagonist of Todd .... ???? Yep horrible movie
This just reminds me of one quote: "A world without women would be a pain in the ass..."
.
Ohhhh noooo its the Star wars woman pleassseee noooo
What kind of loser company has to show a preview of a preview with a countdown timer? How are you that lame??
wut? I think I have too much of a smooth brain to understand wtf just happen
I am angy
Y Last Man is on way, meanwhile we have Only, Light Of My Life, and this
Wow they have the power of the girl with bear amulet in new mutants
Spider sense
Great Movie.
Why do I feel like the movie ended on a cliffhanger, I mean viola didn't even kiss todd in the end :(

Mads Mickelson, sold. Mads Mickelson, Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley. Tite!
I like to imagine Todd having intrusive thoughts about banging his pretty girl,  and halfway through the flim she completely gives in, and let's him take her.
Boring movie
Me : I need to get rid of my obsession with Tom Holland  Also me : proceeds to subscribe to lionsgate just to watch this
This looks awe full
This is 2021’s biggest box office bomb so far and one of the absolute worst.  It has a great cast though.
He even have his spidey sence in this movie, wired variant
I'm only watching this because of Tom Holland
He's the perfect actor for this one
I’d have appreciate the lesson to be learned from this movie as a youth.    Thanks Tom holland and Daisy Ridley for your part in this creation.
I like Tom hilalund
this movie looks so bad wtf
Am I the only one that tried to control my thought lol
Basically any all-male elementary school seeing a girl for the first time.
He deserved a kiss at the end...at least..
tom holland sucks
So, watched the movie. I can say that I was correct: Daisy still can't f!cking act.
That girl is so beautiful 😍😍
As someone who has loved the books for a good few years, I refuse to watch this. Why on earth do they always cast ADULTS as the kids??? Don't tell me you can't get good actors that are kids... What about the new It movie and Stranger Things? And the fact that Todd is so chill about the fact that he saw a girl... when he literally thought every single girl on the planet was dead because of a deadly virus. And he's just like "oh, neat, a girl" like WHAT
Trailer: „Who are you?“ My brain: „THE GIRL FROM STAR WARS“
One of the worst movies i have ever seen, highly annoying. could only stand about 20 minute of it.
perfect for Americans
i Like movies without a night scene.
I'm sure every femenist is drooling over something like this to happen for real.
i had a headeache after 20 min of the nonstop mind talk , did disturb me.. had to pause for a while and continue later
Anyone read the books??
Spiderman + star wars=
I never watched the movie yet but at some point planning too.  Just from watching this trailer my gut tells me the females was killed cause the males could not hear their thoughts.
More like "Simp Ultimatum" or "Brokeback Planet"...
Does anyone know that this was a series? I read it, and it’s amazing that it’s being developed into a film! I can’t wait to watch it.
isn't this the book.... noughts and crosses?
Overthinking may be the cause of your death here.
Oh this movie is newer than I thought it was
I just watched it, only read the first book but I remember how amazing it was. Remember absolutely hating that bastard Aaron. Also - spoiler alert.. well, not really.. but the spackles are extremely underwhelming in the movie there’s like one scene and that’s it!!   Film coulda been better, but it wasn’t bad.
They are better off naming this movie "SAUSAGE FEST."

So… I don’t have inner monologue and my dad thinks it’s funny to watch this with me because I just think everyones like crazy lol
Film is very poor with not even half of a plot. The gimmick (being able to hear others' thoughts) is annoying as well. 4/10. Mads Mikkelson has made some very poor role choices.
So this movie is basically about a massive simp who hasn't seen a girl before in his entire life.  Sign me up.
I stopped watching the film on "weak like a woman". Fuck the film I am not watching it.

Funny thing is when I watched another trailer for this movie and saw Daisy Ridley with blonde hair... I thought legit she was one of the sprouse twins with a blonde wig like in that one episode of suite life. Sorry Ridley but blonde doesn't look good on you. T_T

It's nice to see Wheeler Walker Jr. with an acting debut!
Gosh, I remember reading the books when I was about 12. I really enjoyed them. Cannot for the life of me remember what they really were about but I'm curious to see this film. I like Tom Holland, been seeing his films since The Impossible and Daisy Ridley, well, it'll be good to see her out of a Space Opera 😅
Bullshit. fuck that reality is wack..
I see this as where we are currently. Just over exaggerated. How our dominant thoughts manifest just as you see characters dominants thoughts manifest. How were are lacking in true feminine energy and majority of us are in our masculine energy. Also, a woman’s intuition.

Ok, before I watch this movie, I need to know if something terrible happens to the dog. I cannot watch a movie where a dog gets hurt. Go and ahead and make fun, but please tell me the dog comes out okay.
Please part 2. From Indonesian movies fans chaos walking
Looks like utter garbage to be honest.
Tom Holland, 24, plays a 12 year old
The ratings are pretty chaotic too
This film was another grade "A" stinker from tinseltown. Imagine if Hollywood had the skill to make movies as exciting as there two minute trailers...  Maybe if you guys push hard enough for YouTube to demonetize the content creators who can net a larger audience than you can with nothing more than a microphone and a desktop; you'll be able to reclaim the popularity that your predecessors were able to generate. 🤷😁
So, am I suppose to believe an entire town let a religious maniac convice them to kill their wifes and family? Highly unlikely. I was also suppose to believe that a bunch of killers and thiefs did not take over the second town way before they did? BS.  I was also suppose to believe that a bunch of broke @ss hillbillies were trying to stop the only girl who was they key to contributing more resources and technology that they have ever seen? This movie has more plot holes than swiss cheese.
They are going to try their best to force sci fi fans to like daisy ridley aren't they? Yet again, another stone face performance where she looks like she's reading her lines off of a teleprompter. The amount of up votes on this are shocking.
I've been waiting this movie for so long, it's so strange to see how they make the noise in the movie compared to the book.
I am Choas and I'm indeed walking.
just imagine, an old man speaking in his head everyday would be so irritating
Top
So there's a Kino's Journey episode about this...
Hi,  I'm here with a message from the future. My thoughts are already on display, and yours will be too.. If not already
I lowkey wish this was real but I overthink
if you ever feel useless   there is Nick Jonas in this movie
Man these mofos need to meditate to silence those thoughts
Yall need to make this a series!!!!!!😭😭😭😭
I feel sorry for all you  people who have now watched, this movie, and hate it lol
sucks
🔥🔥🔥 Канал "Lionsgate Movies" просто супер!!! Удачи Вам и процветания!!!🔥🔥🔥
Origins Spirits of the past movie cast perhaps
I read the Intire trilogy of these books and they were my favourite books, now i am so hyped
Could they only afford one drum for the music of the trailer?
So all men date each other or what?
Terminator has no undies
#releasethechaoticcut
good movie to watch.  not sure why reviews rating is low
If my thoughts were visible it might be brazzers everywhere
it was surprisingly so good.. the acting was superb.. high energy, fun dialogues.. , realistic chemistry between actors... much better than any latest Hollywood movie  imho. Mind me: i had no idea who is in the movie or anything. Only afterwards i’ve discovered the actors : their performances were just excellent,... you see there are many movies that have amazing action sequences but the acting is so horrid, that it makes you question the purpose of this sort of entertainment (wrath of man for example ). So no Chaos walking wasn’t absolutely horrible. Maybe it wasn’t a memorable one, but the chemistry, energy and dialogues in it were just great!
Rey Skywalker , Spider-man , and Nick Jonas in the same movie..? i find it disturbing... or is it just me?
Is she a Mary Sue in this one?
The books by Patrick Ness are fantastic! The film doesn't do them justice. It's a shame with all the tech, money and good actors, it was kinda  crappy.
Well. spider-man has more super powers now.
0:28 gamers be like
this movie was straight doo doo ngl. i like tom holland and nick jonas but i was so confused the whole movie
No thanks for another boring C-movie in clichés
The comment section is better than the trailer 😂😂😂
oh shit i think i read this book
bro if this ever happens you're gonna hear a lot of bruh sound effects from your boy
I think the better title is '"THE KISS"

propaganda.ready  for future times to come........ hat it will be ok to violate you and read your thaughts in some shitty experiment
my two favourite actors. Tom Holland and Mads Mikkelsen
No need to be watched, I just lost 20 min of my live to see the idiotic scenario where everyone's thoughts are supposed to be visible, but only one person's thoughts are visible, the rest in 90% of cases are hidden because there will be no suspense and intrigue. Somehow the bad guys think secretly according to the screenwriter.  One big bullshit...

For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.   For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. John 3:16-17  Jesus is The Son of God who was sent to the earth from Heaven to die on the Cross to save humans from burning in hell FOREVER. He took the punishment who us who deserve to be punished. So since He died and Rose again, we can now be free from hell and He offers us everlasting life meaning to live FOREVER  with Him in Heaven or the New Earth. All we have to do to receive this free Gift is to believe in Jesus, believe in that He died for yours sins and believe that He Resurrected (came back to Life) on the third day. Once you believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus is LORD you will be saved. (Saved  from hell). He is coming soon, tomorrow is not a promise so please dont waste time, put your faith in Jesus while there is still time, so you wont have any regrets. Jesus the Only Way, the Truth, and the Life. Once you have Jesus you have everything you need. You have freedom with Jesus. Besides you can see literally see nearly everything the Bible talks about comes through so why doubt when you can see the Truth unfolding in front of our eyes. If you want to know anything at all regarding Jesus you can ask. God Loves you, Jesus Loves you.  https://chat.whatsapp.com/K1ff9wfO9EQ1cLM5gSwW8e

The men should learn to meditate. Just saying, lol. Might shut their minds up.
SPOILERS ***SPOILERS***  Definitely a dope movie 9/10. But umm....i hope they plan on making a 2. Because they never shed any real light on some things. And move past other things like they never happened.  1. Shackles. We hear about them, have a run in with one but never actually learn anything about them. All we know is they're native to the planet, they too have Noise and they never actually killed the women. We know they might want something with Men which is seen when the one tried to take Todd but thats it, we never see or hear about them again. We never learn their true purpose nor what they are or why they are. I mean...Are they whats left of human minds? Are they a real threat? Why didn't it go after viola? Why does it just give up and leave? Etc.  (I'm kind of guessing that they may be blind and go after Men simply because they can hear them.)  2. Preacher. He obviously played a big part in the movie but we never actually learn a thing about him either. All we know is he's religious, he participated in the killing of the women and wanted to die to atone for it. Thats it. He continuously refers to Viola as an angel, why? What does he know ? He goes from seeming like he might actually be a good guy, to trying to kill viola and then all of sudden begging to be killed. We don't truly learn much about him , but he was made to seem like an important character.  Lastly, once the ship actually arrives, viola and Todd are now safe I guess. And thats that. We Never see an introduction to the crew nor get to see their reactions to the noise. The perrisstown people just leave. And Boom roll the credits. And oh yea I almost forgot, **We see Todd use his Noise as a weapon kindve, when manifesting that snake to scare the one dude. But lol, he never uses it like that again. What was the point of that?**  I know this is a long comment but 😂😂 I just feel like more could have happened in the movie. So I'm wondering and hoping they planned for a CW2 . Because I know the fight isn't just over like that. I can't be right? There's gotta be more to this.😭😭
This looks AWESOME!
They went on hard with the photoshop for that movie poster :P
im interested in this movie
i'm fucking pissed because aaron killed manchee
I lost interest when they drowned the dog what a crap piece of shit movie!!!!

Okay so I really enjoyed the movie and I was stoked when I learned the dogs name because I basically have the same name just an A in the front. I for real paused the movie. Rewinded it and was like thats awesome!!!
"Do it do it fuck it do it"
This was one of the best ones... I'm Tod Hubert...
There are no women in Prentisstown and that means only one thing... go gay with Nick Jonas or Tom Holland 😂😋
Does anyone know why exactly why there are no woman on this planet?
napiču film
Haha wow this movie looks like shit
I loved this movie omg ❤️❤️
It's better to know nothing than to know everything.
1:27 is clearly Jonah Scott
Zzzz...another PC SJW movie that teaches us that "Men are bad. Women are good - and better". It's getting real old.
To get into someone's thoughts is the actual and literal death of the human race. I mean it like seriously say goodbye to humanity.
It's only 5G so don't even think about it. Simple.
This could have been so much better executed. And would be so much better as a TV series. I don’t understand they didn’t think of using the power of thought more. Like he did with the snake. It’s like falling in the middle of a huge story and just hear some of it.
Traumatizing part in the movie was how the dog died. My heart broke 😥.
i didnt like how they didn't go more into detail about the native species
Maybe I'll watch this, just for Daisy Ridley and Mads Mikkelsen. Maybe.
This movie shows the full potential of Spidey’s Peter Tingle(Spider-Sense) and the perfect Gwen Stacy casting for the MCU!!
so this dude starred in two great movies in one year absolute genius
The books are brilliant and I hope that this doesn't ruin it sorta thing
So like reverse mind reading? Interesting
Holy shit, I remember reading "The Knife of Never Letting Go" ages ago. I can't believe it's being turned into a movie after all these years.
Why didn't he just use his Spidy-sense and swing away?!
Yeeeey my favourite actor (Tom Holland)  Is playing in this😁
Fack, i came here(comment) hoping to see reviews of this movies, if its worth a watch but instead all bunch of "I've read the book, can't wait" "hope is good" or some lame as jokes. Can someone please tell me if this movie is shit? Which i have a feeling it is. Well, actually I'm not gonna watch it, i collect n download movies, i have thousands of other better movies i don't watch, i just wanna know if i should download it

Turned it off when they killed the dog.
All Men: "On this planet, you know all the thoughts of every man without having to ask them a damn thing." Girl: "Where are all the women?" All Men: "..."
Cant wait for part 2♥️
*Was anyone else surprised to see Nick Jonas riding a horse?!?* 🐎❤
crap realy lame flic, they used a big man as a stuntdouble for daisy in the river scene ..... realy lame
Loved this movie it was so good! Just didn’t like the part in the river... the possessed guy drowning the dog!? Really!?
Was this the movie that was supposed to be originally uncharted?
I loved this movie!!
The best thing about this is that they have tried to keep it as close as possible to how we think..our thoughts are always in the form of a chatter and not statements as they come out.
a world with only men and no women to annoy them sounds like paradise. on the other hand, lets face the facts...everyone in the world is gay.  its a sausage fest.
In this world, all man are honest, to the bone, while all women are insidious 🤣🤣🤣
I already saw thw movie and i can say that, this could give a good series
I'm getting chills watching this trailer. This is going to good to see.
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? I mean, come on now. No man can ever know what's happening inside a girls mind. And every girl in this planet knows what a man is thinking before he even thinks about it.
did the women also had the noise?... and then they all killed each other?... that would explain a lot
this movie is hot garbage.
Well it's a very subtle way of telling us that women died from thinking too much... And boy would they be right.
When I watched this on Saturday with my family, I was thinking that it was kind of boring. When it was over, my daughter said, "Not much went on in that movie!" And I told her that I agreed!
The Gayest movie ever!
Lesson learned: Those with better control of mind are in better places in life.... The Ending of the movie has nothing to do with reality ( which is obvious)
really good casts but not a good movie, wasted my time
I overthink a lot the damn trailer making my head hurt 😂😂😂
The adventures of rey skywalker and spider-man
I saw full movie ill spoil a little the town with boys will not allow girls here
I kept passing on this one..  and I finally watched it, and damn!!  I fucking love it.  Wish there was more..  I think they did a great job. Casting, acting, score, story, environment. Everything is spot on for a dope sci-fi flick.  Something new and exciting.    Highly recommend.
Vary good
Sadly she won't live down "Rey who?" for a long time
I hope it'll be a trilogy. I've always wanted to see Monsters of Men as a film
Finally. The books were amazing
Looking forward to see Daisy Ridley in more stuff that's not Star Wars
Just watched Chaos Walking, very interesting movie! I can't imagine a world with open thoughts, seems rough! Lol
I actually enjoyed the movie. I highly recommend it if you’re a fan of tom and rey skywalker
I’m Todd Hewitt
i'm only here because it said tom holland and nick jonas
Ah Daisy and space.... Them again
Is the wookie still working on starwars
Is Hands Solo in the chewy on this film ?
Which Star wars is this?
IMAGINE HAVING ADHD ON THIS PLANET MYGADD LMAOO
Ok ok ok: so a lot of people say that there’s a lot of sexist comments in this movie, but isn’t that the story?? We’re considering watching this movie, could someone please elaborate? Thank you
I loved these books, I’ve been waiting for a Chaos Walking movie for YEARS!!!
I should not think of spoilers. ~ Tom Holland every year
Spoiler alert, imma put it on and just fool around with my girl 20 minutes in🤷🏾‍♂️
Benjiiieeee!!!

What a frustrating movie to watch. Going with low expectations people. Low
A planet of all men? Sounds like hell
They just had to kill the dog,  didn't they,  Tom and Daisy are too old for their characters this had the production value of a star gate episode in 1997
shit
Spider man vs Kaecilius
Tom Holland looks like "Phil Foden" lol
Whoever’s wondering if they want to watch this movie I’d give it a 7 out of 10 it was a good story just poorly executed and very predictable
Perfectly boring.
This movie sucks the best actors are the horse an Dog they kill to make u wanna hate the bad guys but can’t keep killing animals to make me care for a movie Hollywood
I see Mads Mikkelsen, i hit like.
1. this looks trash but way more importantly, 2. Why the does the girl look like Cole Sprouse in a wig
So all the women just died ? JUST WOMEN ?????? Finally  a world without any road accidents !!!
He was Raised Dealing with the Noise, So he should have a more natural flow of his thoughts, but his thoughts makes him sound Mentally Challenged. Yet he can Conjure a Dragon. TRASH.👎🗑
So, the men let him or were led by the mayor to kill their girlfriends, mothers, sisters, wives because a crazy shit man told them too and they have to obey him like sheeps because the females know their thoughts? Only pervers, cowards and killers would have that problem. 👎😝
Why does his thoughts sound like he's Rain Man?
Movie was disappointing
*PREACHER* the guy who killed his dog *MAYOR* the guy who killed his Mom, Dad Were not killed by his own hands. *-DISSAPPOINTED*  oh and that Preacher is a *Masochist Psychopath.* 🤣
YOOOO MY FAVOURITE ACTOR THE MC OF MY FAVOURITE BOOK? SAY LESSS. Edit: wait is the dog here or what cause RIP dog was a good friend

This looks incredible.  I can't wait until it comes out.  I plan to watch it at theater or rent it.  But, I'm not sure when the Theaters open around me.  Lot are still closed.
Фильм просто 👎
🚮
Wow, putting the 2 least likable people in Hollywood in the same movie. I'm sure that will pay off... no, no it didn't. No one wants this or will see it other than the 6 SJW's who praise it on Twitter sock accounts.
Holy crap I just happened to see this in the PlayStation Store and something about the thumbnail just caught my eye so checked out the trailer and this looks sick!  I'm glad I don't have to wait for it to come out 😁 I definitely know what I'm watching this weekend ‼️🤩
Great concept, weak story, average movie
They never ended up kissing
Chaos walking dead
Great concept
Still no kiss after all the dude did lol..least he alive
Imagine reading a story tho. As you read it you could visualize it and basically watch it as a movie.
This movie gave me second hand embarrassment so hard . . .
I’m going to bet that this film is going to be cancelled for having all the women dead
Zenon 4?
They cut the parts where Daisy Ridley is acting 😂
I think there should be a sequel for this, coz the book has got series.
Make half the men change their pronouns, boom, problem solved.
جاري المشاهدة 2021/4/2
Just another feminist fantasy.
I’ll watch this movie just because of the dog
I have the same exact dog Holla
Manchee deserves more
Original ideas left them many many years ago,... All the movies for the last 20 years are remakes or look alikes with a slightly different twist. So boring !
my recent favorite is the father. why no good movies nowadays
pretty bold of them to leave the comments on
They didn’t have to kill the dog...worst part of the movie
the trailer music doesnt match whats being displaying on screen lol, cringe
only girl in the planet "those men catch you, they kill you." really? i dont think so. LOL
Bad movie!
Btw, thanks for not showing entire movie in the trailer, I really like it
Put the Spider-man and Rey Skywalker in the movie and let’s see what happens
Did I just see Nick Jonas or something? lol
So everyone's gay on this planet?
THIS IS KINDA LIKE OUR ONLY WORLD "EARTH" IF YOU THINK POSITIVELY OR TRUTHFULLY THEN  THE GOVERNMENT WILL DESTROY YOU, JUST LIKE THE HAVE WITH ALL OF OUR FALLEN TRUE PATRIOT HEREOS
Blooper: At 1.02.11 Ridley is laying on a bed with bare feet, at 1.02.15 she has shoes & socks on. Gotta love continuity....
Possibly my most favourite Director EVER!! and I"m not one for directors.. But this dude.. I'd love to meet him.. Doug Liman..
DR.SCOTT MCQUATE Is The TRUTH!! Btw:Thanks For he Video.(*_*)
Great cast, top director (Liman), great source, original concept. Worst music ever. Worst font ever. Seems like Hollywood intervened and spent as much money as possible on completely ruining it. Which is pretty normal these days.
Watching Now 😃
I love this movie Spoiler! And I cried when his dog died
Shut up todd
all that sacrifice that young man goes through...all for the first woman he ever meets who doesn't reciprocate his sympathies
⭐⭐⭐⭐
👍👍
Excellent film. Have not seen a good movie in a long time, letting everybody know this is a must see, just got done watching it excellent!
0:31 "Don't tell Aunt May!"
Worst movie. The entire movie is just pointless running around and whispering.
They removed the noises on women because it will be a disaster.
got that woke shit head from starwars
am I the only here who ship tom and daisy? they look cute together. I cant stop smiling watching this movie lol
You know there's a problem with the film if the trailer is more than 2 minutes long.
I don't know..
Movie starts out with a racist black man beating on a white boy.
How did this get 10 million views?
You guys are really gonna freak out when you see the side effects of the pfizer jab
I heard the synths and drums one second and was like sold. Say no more fam
I'm Todd Hewitt...........
Oh love.... yes of course....
real chaos would be if you could hear women's thoughts.
Nope🤣🤣🤣an unexplored planet ...happens to look exactly like earth!! Thats just grim. Wheres the creativity. Moving on 1/10
Who makes these trailers OMG, the dude needs to be changed! They suck!
looks so boring
this looks incredibly stupid.
I am Todd Hewitt 😂🤣
This video was inspired from my story when I was in in college in Mechanical Engineering section ...
I saw this last night what a load of dog shit it was & the i can hear what your all thinking in your heads all though the film done my head  in
we are going to see Tom Holland in everytihng now beacuse of spiderman
Why do they have to kill the dog?
Complete rubbish about space that doesn't exist, with some cheap cowboys killing and destroying everything
Its  NOT okay to kill inocent dogs. He was the best Charakter in the movie. How dare you !
The reviews are terrible.
Hope to see holland becomes worlds best senior actor
So star wars powers with MCU people, in the wilderness?
This is a  brilliant concept. Gonna order the book and read before watching it because movie more than often butcher a good book.
For me it was a good movie cause i havent read the novel so maybe this is good for people who does not read the novel first but for those people who read it  i think its not good
Dunno about the movie (yet), but the trailer is not so good. I had to turn my volume up way too much in order to hear any voices and music still overlapped them too much. The general composition of the video is also too chaotic and I can't treat it as a nod to the title. I'd consider revising the structure of the trailer.
Tom Holland Spider Sense is tingling
I have that is kinda like messager you have to wait for your turn to talk and you have to keep up
A world without women?  I would imagine the gay rate is DEFINITELY much higher than the accepted 10% figure in that world! lol
Bitch i wanna know if the movie is similar to the movie or not ( as i can see it's not very similar but you know what i mean )
Aren’t we gonna talk about how they made Nick Jonas seem like an “extra” in this trailer? My guy didn’t even get a mention😂

Movie sucked. I wondered why I was the only male in the theater, but halfway through I had my answer. Just another feminist flick.
I thought Liam Hemsworth came out in this movie
Already ❤ the concept 🙌😁
The book is amazing. high hopes for this one
If there is not a dragon or cougar made by someones thiughts in chaos walking 2 ima kill myself
Oh god, not Rey again! YAWN! More feminist crap!
I want to watch it I really do but I swore to myself that I wouldn't watch it til I finished the book so ... I guess I am waiting til its on DVD
i have a feeling women will love this fantasy film.
This is totally be a romance 🤔
Spoilerrrrrr        This movie would have been 1,000x better if the horses and dog didn’t die just sayin. Spoiler idc it made me cry 🥺
This comment section is beyond amazing.
I love/hated the book. I hope the movie or series is better developed. I only read the first book, I'm not a sadomasochist so I couldn't continue the series.

I just read the book, planning on watching the movie soon and I hate how they did Manchee. I thought he was a dog like a sheepdog mix but they made him a tiny terrier-
I’m just here for Mads 😭😭😭😭😭
ehhh....its ok
rad i want to see this
cool they can weaponize their thoughts
I watched this in theaters it was terrible the biggest climax In the movie (spoiler) was the dog dying and that lasted 1 minute same with the grief half the movie was just a lot of walking and left me with a lot of unanswered questions
I saw the movie, it's not worth it. Very average like most Tom Holland movies. They get the hype, but never live up to it.
Im a little disappointed by this trailer, it seems way off from the book

Hmmm let me look for a movie with Daisy haven't seen much of her apart bad star wars.......nice chaos walking just got out let me check trailer.....tom holland mmmm ok cool.....MADS MIKKELSEN OK I'M WATCHING IT!....nick jonas....ok I ain't watching
Big fan of Tom 👍
As someone who read and absolutely loved the books, I feel like the vibe of this movie is...off. Seems way too action-y, when the books were more about the psychological implications of men hearing each other's thoughts, about the nature of jealousy, xenophobia, and the slippery slope to genocide. There were some really dark themes that I'm guessing this movie barely touches on. The fact that Tom and Daisy are both clearly adults also really takes away from the impact of what these two kids witness/do in a world full of corrupted and weary adults. Maybe it's just the way the trailer is edited, but I really hope they stuck to the tone and themes of the book.
I liked the movie, I didn’t really know what to expect but I would say it’s good, it felt short though and a bit rushed. It would have been great if they took more time with it and made another movie.
So, I have a bad feeling from this trailer that Daisy, as in star wars, will basically have only 2 or 3 different faces/expressions during the whole movie. Hmm, wait and see I guess.
The moment I heard a dog is drowned and bashed in this I didn’t get anywhere near it. Heard it’s shit anyway
1:46 reminded me of monkey from 'Cloudy with a chance of Meatballs' : hungry! : hungry! : hungry!
WHY DID I MISS THIS TRAILER??? WHERE ARE THE ADS FOR IT?
Oh look spiderman
This trailer is so bad 🤣 even after watching the movie that trailer made no sense. Decent movie anyway
I love that snake scene It’s hot and funny at the same time
I saw this movie and I liked it . Daisy Ridley is so cute .
We get to see just how terrible daisy riddleys acting (and looks) really is/are.
2 questions....Is gay the new black? How the species survived without women? 🤔

Ma Lady - The movie
when does it come out ??
1 female on a country which only has males on? Only dirty thoughts come into my head, i apologise 😂
bet they kill the dog. filmmakers no longer are original they have to put in the cheap awe stunt
Easily the crappiest movie of this year...
Btw the dog dies
Just watched the trailer still no clue what this movie is about, a little help ?
Have a great day god love you
I’m so excited!! This looks really good!

Tom Holland: *thinks about memes*
Movie was okay. Tom Holland was great. If your going to watch it because of Nick Jonas then I would pass!
This book series messed me up a bit when I first read it when I was younger. I actually forgot about it until I saw this trailer. Time for the horrible flash backs
This type of movie is the type you will either hate or love and I just happened to love it not just bc of Tom but because of daisy ridley and her performance. Loved this movie
Last time i saw a starship and Daisy it ended quite badly, not watching this
*THERE’S A MOVIE??!!*
This actually looks amazing 👌🏻
0:45 I like that sound for some reason idk why though.
I would hate to live in this world I mean like every other minute some sexual thought just pops up in my head
the perfect combo has come to life. Daisy Ridley and Tom Holland
Its daylight in every scene shown outside, and when the scene is inside the windows also reflect daylight!,    So, what IS the dark secret? How far away can their thought bubbles be seen and heard? Intriguing!
They were filing this near my house!!! Can’t wait to see it
I see.. Nick Jonas inspired from priyanka chopra and is acting now 😂
The movie is boring asf
I wonder if Tom will ever get a role where he can just have his normal accent lol
why did you suggest on a fred video
I’m gay
this is like ADHD but on the outside aha
Never seen a girl but knows what a girl looks like.....

Was the movie good ?
This soundtrack is probably from the people behind the Black Widow trailer music.
Garbage
You might not like my dog-
It’s not a bad movie. Like they did a good job. But the ending is just kinda fast. It’s a regular book ending. But critics are dumb it’s not as bad as the 25% they gave. But seriously it’s just a fast ending. But you can’t change the ending. Like you go past the ending it’s a bad ending. Like the ending is good it’s just fast.
This looks like just the first book which is totally fine but im hoping the other two books actually come out as movies too 😭

Tom Holland is so bloody talented.
I just watched the movie it was amazing
Im here to say one (1) thing: mads mikkelsen
lol it's doing even worse that cherry
The background music is *amazing*
Hmm, I don’t know. This looks iffy. At the very least, this trailer isn’t doing the movie any favors.

The Chaos Walking trilogy is the book series, the first of the trilogy being The Knife of Never Letting Go. I wonder if the film intents to make sequel films based on the rest of the trilogy? Maybe simply calling it Chaos Walking instead of Chaos Walking: The Knife of Never Letting Go was a way to mask its status as the first of a series, just in case the reception wasn't strong enough to support making the sequels? Or maybe they chose to lose the Knife of Never Letting Go part of the title because it wasn't as catchy (fair enough). I haven't seen the film yet, but I'm a great fan of the book series and I hope the movie does it justice and inspire more potential readers to check it out. I'm impressed so far by the depiction of the 'Noise' in the trailer - I always thought it would be too tricky a concept to portray in a movie well, but they seem to have found a good way to balance the abstract jumble of conscious and subconscious thoughts/feelings/visuals with the dialogue in a way that doesn't bombard the viewer with too much word clutter. I am noticing though the distinct lack of 'Noise' from some of the scenes in the trailer where one would expect them. It's very clear in the books that the 'Noise' lives up to its name, being a constant din of thoughts in the background that they just learn to live with as part of being in a settlement full of men, so much so that the presence of the girl in the distance is AUDIBLE to the boy as a pocket of silence, a noticeable hole in the Noise. That's how noisy the background clatter would be if it were being book-accurate. (Totally get why that change had to happen for a movie adaption.)

Cannot wait for the Honest Trailer and Pitch Meeting! Voice-over guy and Ryan George are going to have a blast with this one!
I don't get why Tom Holland hasn't put this movie on his IG, there's only Cherry and Spiderman there. Is he ashamed of it? I mean him and Ridley are big names and I only came to know of this film 5 minutes ago and things are not making sense!
That didn't make any sense to me
Do not go watch, trailer is conceiving  ..more talk then action...and they show that alien 3 times in trailer and its just from one scene...thats all you see of it... thousands of nothing....very disappointed in move...D-
AAAAAnnd its a flop... of course it is.. Ridley cant convince me of anything such a horrible actress

Awww the dog that plays manchee is sooo cute (I’m obsessed over the books btw)
Let's be honest, if only men lived in a planet, they would ALL be gay.
Chaos walking 2021
Sad that Mads Mikkelsen's name isn't in the title or trailer.. Wouldn't fit? That's what increased my interest. He brings character in an otherwise cheese-looking fest.
I love these books. I hope the movie(s) do them justice.
The world of literature is a strange world indeed.
I AM SOLD LMAO
This planet would suck for me bc I have adhd and ocd so my brain never shuts the fuck up lmao
There was no advertising for this movie whatsoever on television or anything
Wow, Spider-man and Rey in one movie, this bout to be interesting
I am watching this one the day this movie is being released in my country. Woah

This movie looks really cool! Looking forward to it!
Daisy look like she aged 10 years sinse rise if Skywalker
Ok can someone pls explain this to me bc I don’t rlly get it why is there only on girl why are thoughts coming out of toms head ?
Wow, how does this even get made?
SO this explains all the Marvel Spoilers from Tom Holland.
Guys is this movie actually getting released? Last I heard it got canceled, I hope that’s not true :( I read the books and I really wanna watch it on big screen
omg omg omg omg
This looks like another feminist dogma movie.
Oddly enough this reminds me of I Am Number Four
Living in this world would be so weird for others that me thinking all day about Pornography!
Now we know what the Peter tingle looks like.
Not even for the sake of Mads Mikkelsen. Has Tom Holland reached puberty yet? That girl that ruined Star Wars might as well go back to waitressing. The idea of subjecting myself to these two contrivances, makes me want to leave this honest evil comment and depart.
Damn, this guys has their own wifi connection
Good movie
People wouldn’t want to hear my thoughts 😂😂
Anyone here Read the books? Bro they are so fuckin good
Nothing better happen to that dog 😤
Why does Tom Holland always play a nerdy awkward kid
Why is no one talking about the amazing book this comes from :(
This is just a hyped up, violent game of cooties. Where you can hear men's thoughts.  yes.
Main besok di jakarta?
Well I guess Fantasy Football won’t be a problem...
Star Wars + Spiderman = Chaos Walking
only a few more days until this comes out!!! i cant waittt👀
i wanna see this so bad
Yikes the marketing for this movie is atrocious. It's coming out in a couple days and this was the only thing I've seen about it in literally all of the internet
Downvoted for trailer countdown
The Modern day feminist would freak at this movie
What's with trailer music these days?
If only she had bypassed the compressor on that ship.....this would'nt have happened!!
Just got this on an ad and I had to search it cause I heard Madds Mikkelsen.
What’re dreams like with this “seeing thoughts” thing?
I'm Rey, Rey Skywalker!...ahhahaha
This movie reminds me of anytime a girl gamer is in the chat.. "Are you a Girl?!"
"OKAY, I GET IT. EVERY ONE OF YOU WANTS TO HAVE SEX WITH ME 24-7. It's the first thing you think of when you see me, always in the background while we're talking, and gets louder whenever I look away and you can oggle me. Jesus Christ. No wonder all the women are dead; how could they stand  it?"
That kid is going to be a horrible actor & a bad choice for this film.  But even without him, I still think this movie is going to be an enormous letdown.
I truly believe that the ONLY reason people are liking the previews of this movie, is because after spending a year in quarantine, people are literally desperate for a new movie to be released.
Loved the books! Can't wait for the movie!!
Ngl this looks like Lisa the painful if it were a movie with Spider-Man
Spider-Man 3 is looking great
With great power comes great responsibilitayyy ಠ_ಠ
I read The Knife of Never Letting Go ages ago and forgot about it. Didn't think it would come back to bite me like this.
I like Tom Holland. But he has a big movie released every year and is already hugely successful as Spiderman. Wouldn't it be nice if some of his roles were given to other struggling or less known actors? Not trying to be negative or anything. I just get a bit bored seeing the same face/same character over and over again, and feel like it's a bit of an injustice to other hard workers
I loved the book, can’t wait for this ⚡️
I love how Tom Holland is showing a lot versitality in his Roles 👏🏻👏🏻
I swear if that human mouth breather cant keep her mouth closed while acting, am gonna lose my shit!!
Spiderman meets the last Skywalker
isn't this like the annihilation
A movie about our thoughts being heard, cast a guy on who can’t stop spoiling.  A match made in heaven.  Edit: By the way this movie sucked.
This looks so so cool and the music sounds p epic
this angers me, because the book series (my favourite series of all time) is very psychological and somber, whereas this makes it look like fucking mad max for cunts sake, I was so looking forward to this
I didn't like the new Star Wars but I loved Daisy. The more Daisy the better all our lives are.

Tom still have spidey sense
thats gr8 and all but what about spiral
I wont allow anyone read my mind
Literally all I care about is the portrayal of Mayor (President) Prentiss. The dude was so good at manipulating everyone and it was always super compelling.
I'm here to say I love Mads Mikkelsen
who here has read the books.
Nick Jonas??

So women are the mentally stable sex, and men are the ones constantly projecting their thoughts/emotions (literally).  What sort of nightmarish reversed role world is this?
Reminds me of Children of men
This looks so good! But always have to do some research before I commit to watching (as is my standard operating procedure with ANY film involving a dog character). *Spoiler alert!! I call it a k9 Spoiler Warning!*  Seems the answer lies in the books its based closely on.  Dear Film Industry, I will not watch ONE more damn movie where you kill the fcking dog, please just stop! I'm sure there's plenty who'd argue compelling story, motivation, character arc blah blah -but I don't care. It's already been done w classic Old Yeller, & Marley & Me literally ruined Christmas one year. I'm spending NO $ on a film with that crap especially as a 'surprise' -it's not a surprise and not enjoyable, just nauseating. And I won't even do that for free.
That best be not real fur
Nick jonas tom holland and daisy ridley such a good combo
I'm was scarred by the series in 6th grade because a librarian told me to read it. I'm so mad this is coming out. There is no way that anyone can do such a dark themed book justice with it's critiques on humans government and war structures. Especially having tom holland play todd really pisses me off because even though todd is young and naive, he has to grow up really fast and I just don't think Tom can pull off anything other than innocent af. I could be wrong, but there are just some books that should stay as books, and this is one of them ESPECIALLY if they try to do the whole series. Now I understand why everyone is always like "the movie doesn't do justice to the book!" for things other than this.
That's crazy mad! I love it!
As someone with ADHD this would be so funny if it were real cuz like it would be even more chaotic I'd probably annoy everyone lol
Now people are going to make trailers of Spider-man 3 out of this saying it's spider-sense.
Cool premise, would be a shame if drama was the only focus of the movie.
I'm just disappointed that they didn't get kids to play the role of Todd and Viola :( But I really hope the movie makes up for it (:
Awesome. I read the books, so I'm pretty excited to see what they do.
GOD I got so excited when I learned this book was getting a movie (technically I learned like 10 minutes ago). I really hope the movie is good. I read the book years ago, and I might read it again, knowing this'll be in theaters in like a week
Am I the only one who thinks that this might be a really bad movie?
1:13
I can’t wait for this to come out😩
Looking forward to this. Shame the movie makers had to make Daisy a blonde. What’s that about? Time to change the narrative.
Why can’t Tom ever be British
Spider man and rey
i saw a trailer on my tv but it was different
Wow, that was awesome ❤️🔥
Amazing movie, WOW 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏.
I like how no one is asking how they reproduce, like, do the guys just f each other????
This is amazing! This is soooo cool!
IVENEVERSEENAGIRLBEFORE O_O
I'm sure Tom Holland doesn't cuss so violently like Todd in the books 🤣
This movie looks like it would be amazing to watch in IMAX
Could you imagine a court room?
is this rated r?
Looks dope
Just sad really! Ridley supports Gina firing...smh! I can always not watch this movie...
Okay okay let me get this straight they are making a movie with the actor that played Spiderman and the actress that played Rei and then they added in a guy from Jumanji? This seems like a suitable group for a sci fi movie🤣🤣🤣
Now I gotta see this
"Get in the boat" is Pewds's line
Yo buscando esta película y se estrena hoy😱
Wow who ever thought that spider man, rey skywalker and alex from jumanji would make a movie together. interesting
This is gonna be a mess
I'll never forget when my teacher read the knife of never letting go to us in class, i cant wait to see this
I am only here for Tom Holland lol, sorry
This movie is incomplete without 'Early One Morning". I prefer Jim Moray's, btw
I loved the book this is from
what if ur 'no thoughts head empty'?
I’m excited to see this movie but I’m hoping for a representation from all 4 books which as far as I can tell, it’s looking promising
THE BOOKS WERE AMAZING AMYAYAYA
A movie about men still never knowing what women are thinking and what we want hahaha
okay. Mads + Jonas are perfect casting and i'm a Tom stan but this... as a massive fan of the books it just doesnt look right?
Tom is my fav aktor
I love this series if they don't do it justice I will cry
How is this any different from how Tom Holland usually is?
It look like more of “chaos in the life of Tintin” than “chaos walking”
She likes his dog.

I just can't wait to see ir
Just finished the book

Sausage party magical cowboys vs alien women vs actual aliens. Wtf is this movie?
Wtf even is this? This trailer made 0 sense.

Rey and Peter Parker together huh?
OMG Spiderman and A Jonas Brother
im reading the second book rn
We need an actor who can play someone who cannot keep anything to himself! Say no more.
OMG HYPE
I want to watch this!
Read the Chaos Walking books too!!
For real not gonna credit our man Mads despite acting longer than these two been alive and making up for half the scenes in this trailer? Grow up lionsgate
YES BEEN WAITING AGES FOR THIS
Is that me
I swear Viola has dark brown hair in the book with blue eyes
The whole I can hear your thoughts thing completely turned me off
Those "loud techno sounds" do not disguise the fact that this movie looks like a burning pile of shit.
My only thought through this entire trailer was, "It's Spiderman, Rey and Hannibal!"
Cant watch this movie coz I see ZACH and CODY as that Blonde girl!! WEIRD!! #suitelifeofzackandcody
Can't wait for all the men on this planet to be cishetero so homophobes don't get upset. 🤭
I’m just happy to see my Tom Holland ❣️
Clearly, the boy is secretly and X-Man.
Spiderman, rey,Grindelwald all together in one movie
This seems really stupid. Not being a hater, I'll still watch it, it just seems like a really dumb premise
Ever since I read the series I’ve been eating for this movie
Fight fight fight that scene is from Attack on titan. I bet not many people notice
IT COMES THE DAY AFTER MY BIRTHDAY? BEST PRESENT EVER.
Tom Holland “ who are you?  Daisy Ridley “ Rey Skywalker” 😂
What is this about Its looks good but what's is it about
This makes me want to read the book before the movie comes out. Does anyone know if it’s good?
Spiderman and Rey Skywalker in a movie together oh hell yes!!

Tom Holland... Trying to distance hiomself from Spider Man. Daisy Ridley trying to distance herself from Star Wars. Pretty hard for one typecast actor to burst out, can two?   Tom was ok in Devil all the Time, but I would not say it was enough to shed him of his Spider Man typecast.
Jumanji and the 100 combined 😯

I’ve been waiting for this movie for literally two years
This is great
Basically, Daisy Ridley plays ... her StarWars Character all over again, only without a Lightsaber - Oh, Pardon, Lasersword.
Pog?
Whos coming to watch dis wid me?
Book was outstanding!
I need to see this!!!
Bruh people would hear me having full fledged debates with myself
OK someone please tell me this is real 😩
Star Wars and Avengers crossover
How bad is this???    The woman can hear what the man is thinking?     It is no wonder there are no women..   Maybe they committed suicide hearing all the crazy sh*t going on in the heads of the men?
Holds baby* my thoughts- THROW THE FUCKING BABY
Daisy looks like one of the sprouse twins had a sex change.
Noooooo Todd and Viola are meant to be teenagers. Why didn’t they cast someone like Noah Schnapp as Todd or anyone else. I really don’t like movies nowadays. Everyone is too old for the part they’re playing
Looks like they are trying too hard. Not impressed.
Ok but tell be why in every movie that nick Jonas is in they always have him wear a jacket like that and ride a black horse😂😂
Am I watching it because of Tom Holland and is this me 20th time watching this idk
This was from a book
Spiderman :Star Wars Coming

New Tom Holland Character : Unlocked
That doesn't look very good ...
How is  Mads Mikkelsen not in the title for this video but Jonas is???
it a sci fi movie and yet the environment isnt
"Squirrel!"  - every book fan when they saw Manchee. No? Just me?
Let me see, Spiderman/Peter Parker + Master Kaecilius+Rey Skywalker........I am sure I will watch this !!!
Look its mads mikkelsen playing a bad guy again
i get the horrible sinking feeling that they arent going to stick to the plot at all. at no point does Viola ever meet with prentiss directly until the 2nd book
Based on this movie's plot line, it could also be titled "Sausage Fest"
I just finished the book. It's sad and had a huge cliffhanger. By looking at the trailer, it looks like they changed a lot.
They need to stop casting Holland in everything now. He is not a good actor.
when spiderman and rey join forces
Literally all I see is Rey and Peter Parker
omg i cant waitt!! looks like tom did a great job
Omgggggg I’ve been waiting for this movie for THREE YEARS
I need to finish reading the last book of this trilogy before I can watch it.
Tom: GET IN THE BOAT!!!   9 Year Olds: FLOOR GANG!!!! TOM IS A GAMER!!
You're telling me, I'm supposed to be getting 2 tom holland movies in the span of a week?!? Cherry then chaos oh my god I can't!!!!
About time this movie is coming  out. They have been making it for years.
What is that thing at 2:13 , I have no memory of monsters or what ever the hell that thing is supposed to be in the books, I only remember a man chasing/hunting them if anyone remembers different could they please explain?
I won't spoil it, but a flood of emotions just hit me because yeah...you know what I mean. Right!? 😭
I really hope they won't kill off Mads Mikkelsen's character here! I love him! So excited for his role here!!!
Wait hold up are Tom Holland and daisy ridley gonna kiss woahhhhh
Someone made a fake spiderman 3 trailer out of clips from “the devil all the time” and “chaos walking”   https://www.facebook.com/groups/2418555855061713/permalink/2734940216756607/    The infuriating part is people actually believe it’s the upcoming spiderman 3
I'm so happy Daisy got casted after the stupid episode 8
Information overload
March 5,2021
Don’t get ur hopes up this movie was deemed unwatchable from the movie studios for years they had to reshoot lots of it it’s probably gonna be decent at best can’t take a movie that bad and make it amazing
So, aren't we gonna admit that rey and peter parker are a couple now?
i’m so glad there’s finally a trailer other than a picture
I’m finally watching this trailer after reading the book and I’m already disappointed... as much as I love the actors in it, I don’t even know if it’s worth watching at this point
My thought on display I think of myself always as the first-person shooter i.e. the 1st hero (male) of the movie when am watching a movie - Kavipurush/ Poetman Sir(self-attested) > AJ
Just imagine deadpool having voices like these 😂😂
This was one of my favorite book series by Patrick Ness! I love his writing. Had NO idea it was being made into a film but now I'm excited!
Manchee is a king
I highly recommend the book!  I pictured the characters just as they are here! amazing!
If only you'd cast Andrew Garfield spiderman
I imagine all us with adhd were killed early just to shut us up  :'D
Daisy without makeup is such an ugly woman...🙄
Ffs can’t wait
oh hell yeah I can’t wait for this and I seen some of my favorites 👀nick jonas 👀and I know I seen that damn Cynthia Erivo

obtenir un remède contre le VIH est un concept puissant, souvent parlé du SAINT GRAAL de la recherche sur le VIH.Bien que des médicaments anti-VIH efficaces aient transformé le VIH en une maladie chronique gérable avec laquelle vous vivez, plutôt que de mourir - prendre une thérapie à vie est un proposition très différente d'être définitivement guéri. Je dis à l'ensemble de la race humaine qu'il existe un remède contre le VIH abordable et évolutif qui a fonctionné aussi bien qu'il mettrait l'éradication mondiale des nouvelles infections à VIH à portée de main, tout en transformant la vie de ceux qui vivent maintenant avec le virus. étant donné l'efficacité de ces médicaments à la fois dans le traitement et la prévention de l'infection à VIH, je dirai à tous ceux qui liront ceci que j'en suis un témoin vivant. contrairement aux fraudeurs et aux escrocs en ligne qui vous joueront et vous laisseront frustrés par la perte d'argent et d'espoir, ces médicaments coûtent moins cher et valent la peine d'être essayés.

This trailer looks very hit-or-miss if you've read the books, hopefully with a $100M budget this movie doesn't BLOW
we think like dogs???
Cw100🙄🙄
Hollywood ruining my childhood one adaptation at a time
I can't fucking wait
If she can read my Mind..."She"LL be hearing..Rise of Skywalker..sucks
I would compose dope ass instrumentals with this power not even gonna lie
Stupendous trailer :)
i have read the entire series and now all am waiting for is the move OvO
Interesting that they’re leaning in to marketing this as an action movie- which I guess makes sense - but the primary feelings I got from the book were more adventure and discovery mixed with a certain amount of horror and weirdness. Yes there was action I suppose. But jumping right into the action in the trailer without letting some of that confusion/horror/awe settle in first seems to cheapen the tone of the story. I hope it’s just a marketing decision and the film is better paced. Never had really high hopes for this film though.
Finally something different in Hollywood
It's gonna be terrible
Spider-Man teams up with Kaecilius. :)
So it only shows thoughts sometimes huh
Daisy Ridley looks like she's about 15 years old here. Weird.
The movie looks interesting, but dang! The music! It's too much. Film music should underscore and be ONE of the driving influences that helps us understand and empathize the scene. I hope that this overdone, highly dramatic music is used less during the actual film.
After earth vibes... probably not as bad tho
I think that game of thrones and his dark materials has proved that book series are best represented through television, should’ve made it a 3 series tv show
Did anyone just realize that Rey looks like Zak and Cody
Tamil Dubbed???
Daisy fucking Ridley ❤️
I'm still not sure how they want to put a trilogy into one movie so I don't really have high expectations 😔 But maybe it'll surprise me. Idk. I love the book series so I hope it doesn't disappoint
Nick jonas 😂 this movie interesting
This looks phenomenal
I would hate living here. I THINK TOO MUCH.
I READ THE LAST TEO BPPKS OF THE TRILOGY IN LIKE A WEEK IT WAS SOOO GOOD AHAHHAHAHHAHA
OMG I AM SO EXITED I AM CAN I CANT OMG WHAT UH I AM SO HAPOY I CANT WAIT I CANT PROCESS I HAVE IM SO EXOTED TJE BOOK HREAY WHAT AHAHHAHAHAH
How are people on that planet born if there are no women, do they grow them in a garden ?
Annihilation+Bird Box+Light of my Life = Choas Walking.
1:00 Mechanical Engineering peps🙏🥺
todd is supposed to be twelve 😭😭😭
Me: hmm, seems boring and generic. Mads Mikkelsen? Ok, I was sold. Love him since Hannibal.
I Need To Watch This Right Now
ok but was i the only one who was a little disappointed by this
What is this fucking dumpster fire? there is nothing about this thats anything like the books. I hope Patrick Ness pulls a Rick Riordan and completely shits all over this movie.
Guys, Spider Man 3: Back Home looks weird.
Is this just an allegory to depict that men REALLY don't know what woman are thinking???
They should make a video game from the movie.
Never coming out
Why is the trailer so Cringy. Could be a good movie. Feels almost like a B-movie trailer.
Tom Holland Marvel Daisy Ridley Star Wars
If they do my favorite series of all time injustice people’s kneecaps are getting broken bitches
Ah, can’t wait for my favorite book series to be ruined
Those antagonists looking like cruella devil
I’m guessing this movie won’t pass the Bechdel test. Lol! Looks good though.
“Who are you?” “I’m Rey...damn it!” 🤦
1:27 Best part in the trailer and I am very excited about this movie
Imagine having adhd in that kinda scenario
If nick jonas is in this, it’s gonna be trash
Omg I’m so excited!
Living in this world would be amazing.  Just imagine: *Plays Wii music in his head*
This movie looks SICK
It's cute they think there will be movie theaters left to release this in 2021 :)
Awwww yiss
Ok dayiuummm
Lionsgate has just delayed Chaos Walking to March 5, 2021 but Chaos Walking will get an IMAX release too! So excited to see Raya And The Last Dragon & Chaos Walking in IMAX in the same week! 🥳🤩😎😍🤯👍🏻
Bahi movie gaand faad h
I'm surprised he wasn't thinking the spoilers in this trailer😂😂😂😂
Daisy is perfect to be Gwen Stacy
One woman in a world full of men ? I don't  know if this is a movie or an elaborate set-up  for a porno.  I can't  take this seriously....it makes no sense.
I hope this movie will be good because Patrick Ness wrote the screenplay for the movie. Also Tom Holland, Daisy Ridley, Nick Jonas, and Mads Mikkelsen seem like an amazing cast.
I love Tom and I will watch the movie, but it seriously looks like something that should've come out in 2014
I have never seen a girl before 😂 oh poor Zen
This is what u call a trailer...
He'd never seen a girl before and still straight
Oi. I'm glad men's thoughts aren't audible. If I was anywhere near Daisy Ridley and she could hear what I was thinking, I'm pretty sure I'd get a hard slap across the face.
Okay but why did I immediately know which books this movie was based of off - I absolutely love these books in high school!!
be honest i bet were all here bcus of tom
Nothing will hurt me as much as the thrilogy but im expecting at least a week of constant crying and 2(two) months of grieving silently
This movie will available in Tamil ???
spiderman and reyy wow
I might f u x k s with this but we gotta see chief....this film has development issues iirc

Is this a sequel to Star Wars or Far From Home
This looks nice😊
Amazing Super Fantastick
Enter the INFPs nightmare...it's probably best that our "overthoughts" aren't just shoved out there - but still super excited for this movie!
TWO YEARS. i don’t have waited 👏two👏years after reading the books and you have no idea how excited i am
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxNDsCg8mtVGKNKtREauk1A
This is a ripoff of an Outer Limits episode called "Tsetse Fly" Hollywood is out of ideas yall.
This planet before a woman showed up was dick and fart jokes, and one giant back yard bbq. One broad shows up and everything turns to hell. LOL
The only woman on the planet, she can hears mens thoughts but they cant hear hers. Oh and she has to be protected at all costs. Sounds like typical gynocentric simp-age to me.
ima just spoil the ending to all of you: tom holland and daisy ridley kiss. its a pretty obvious so dont get your hopes up for something else. it seems like an obvious trend happening in most movies. *sigh* 😔
Where is Spider-Man and the Jedi when you need them?
Finally rey is back to the space after defeating palpatine 😂
Daisy Ridley Sucks, but Tom Holland rules.
Tom Holland will soon rule the world of fans
READ THE BOOKS! They are amazing
Mads Mikkelsen in a movie always equals good movie. Count me in
I have a feeling it's gonna be political af. And it will just turn out to be another man-hating piece of media that next to nobody will watch. They're gonna fuck up the story and change it to be completely different to the original which will not only appear cheap, and disrespectful, it'll also piss off the fans of the original story who are the main people who would want to see this movie, so it won't make any money because the non-fans won't come in large enough numbers for the movie to make a profit. And everybody will have forgotten about this movie in like, a month or so if this is the case. I hope the movie doesn't suck, but I expect it to. If it doesn't go down the man-hating political path the movie could actually be successful, to the chagrin of blue-haired land whales who weren't going to see the movie anyway... From what I understand the town that todd (tom holland) is from has no women because the men of that town killed all the women for some reason, this is fine by me a small group of assholes that aren't representative of all men, but I think there are basically gonna be very few to zero good male characters aside from todd, again I hope I'm wrong, I hope it stays true to the original story... But I'm probably not wrong. And it probably won't.
When are movies showing in cinemas again?
Time to read the books before this comes out.
Get ready for the next big YA sci-fi epic. Me: Oh...Eh, I'm not really a big fan of... Written by Charlie Kaufman Me: Oh my god! Yes!!!!!  Yeah.  I know that he only worked on the first draft of the script, but it's enough of a sell for me.
Spidey sense go nuts
Why do I get the feeling that daisy ridley can possibly play gwen stacy thanks to the blonde hair and both of them are british 🙂🤣
imagine if this was our world...
I can't. I just can't. This is way too much for me.
"Where are all of the women?" He replies, "They're dead." F&#k no. Somebody put a bullet through my head. I would not want to live in a world like that.
So it's basically a movie that demonizes men. Nah I'm good.
its been 84 years...
0:39 -Who are you? -Rey  -Rey who? -Rey Skywalker
2:17 aku pas lagi ibadah
I need Cherry trailer now
Amazing. Can't wait
I'm obsessed, cominig here for coupe times per day since  trailer dropped
Pretty sure this movie was even more of a myth than New Mutants.....
This seems incredibly stupid.
awesome experience #tomhollandofficial
I had no idea my favourite book trilogy was getting made into movie!!! Today is a very good day!
Rae looks different here
Kiss 🤨🙄
After Earth 2
The music sounds badass
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
Well... that's a lot of star power.
Well for some planet where mens thoughts are displayed  out loud  im pretty sure only women should be alive
Everyone’s talking about Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley but I’m just here for Mads Mikkelsen baby
The difference between socialism and "democratic socialism" is just like the difference between murder and suicide.  Just because they put the gun on the table and try to convince you it's a good idea, doesn't make the result any different.  Most communist regimes initially got into power with a vote (combined with fraud to be sure) where some people were convinced that it was a good idea.  That's what CNN and their co-conspirators are working toward now.
Clips from video games, shows and movies are often playing in the background in my thoughts. In this world I would be a walking TV with constantly changing channels.
Daisy Ridley in a space adventure? I'm in also, she and Tom look like they're playing Peter Parker and Rey lol
Hmmmmmmm they arent following the book at certain points, wonder how its gonna go
The way that they are showing noise is cool, but this looks nothing like the books, using loads of creative licence.
this was an hilarious experience for me
First, New Mutants and now this. I think pandemic is giving multiple times delayed movies chance to release.😂😂
Awesome 😎
Daisy Ridley? No.

i read this book series like six times im so excited
This looks really good, pushes the book up my TBR!

Can you imagine a schizophrenic living in this world
This!!! THIS THIS THIS THIS THIS!!!!! YEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSS!!!! I'M SUPER EXCITED! IT LOOKS AMAZING AND THEY CHOSE THE BEST ACTORS AND ACTRESSES!!! Lol I'm calm, one of the first trilogies I read going into highschool, and still one of the most amazing, interesting  and unique stories I can think of.
sweet trailer shit music
the books are sick and hopefully the movie would be too
"Who are you?" "RAID Shadow Legends."
Interesting concept. Looks like a tween novel though, so the writing probably won't be very good.
Saw this trailer a couple days ago, ordered the trilogy and I literally finished the first book in a couple of hours. Would highly recommend reading them.
Spider-Man and Rey love story? Yes please
This looks remarkably shite.
I could be mads if there's no mads here
"Where are all the women?"  "Are you kidding me? They left. They could hear our thoughts. We're disgusting."
Looks pretty average at best.
good concept...terrible execution of filming
All these comments seem to know what the movie is before seeing the trailer,so from an outsiders perspective from seeing the trailer the movie looks good but I think they could have come up with a better name.
Screen rant: It is official that the Star Wars and MCU have crossed universes.
A movie with spider man and Rey. Multi verse?
I can’t say how good this trilogy of films will be but what I can say is that it visually looks boring as hell. Fuck knows where the budget went because it certainly didn’t go to the cinematography, colour grading, cameras, etc
Hannibal and Spiderman in the same movie?
Thank you, Lionsgate Movies!
Wow, this movie look amazing.
did anyone else picture violas hair to be black????????????????? just me??
Guessing this movie doesn’t pass the Bechdel test🤣
Is that a Jojo reference?
Is Daisy going to be a Marey Sue again?
you get this type of chaos when spiderman,star trek and Doctor strange and are conflate
I need to watch that movie!!!
Does your pastor teach you that satan is coming pretending to be Christ? Do they teach you that the "rapture" is a satanic lie? If not, know that you have NOT been taught truth. No pitchfork, no red suit, it is lies! Satan comes PEACEFULLY & PROSPEROUSLY pretending to be Christ! The Shepherd's Chapel teaches the correct way! Dont be fooled! https://youtu.be/DAyNnJfsNCY
is it strange that i am reading already the second book since it aired
Rey Palpatine and Galen Erso are in a movie with Spider-Man. The closest we’ll ever be to a Star Wars x Marvel movie.
Tom: Who are you?  Daisy: I’m Rey.  Tom: Rey who?  Daisy: Rey Palpatine.
"Don't be afraid I feel it too" - Kylo Ren
Hannibal probably ate all the women. :/ Guess his psychiatrist's leg wasn't enough
Idk why they decided to try making a movie based upon a novel that’s so highly reliant on its written format in order to be effective This movie looks super janky  They’d at the very least better not conveniently forget that Todd has two Dad’s  What am I saying, it’s Hollywood, of course they’ll conveniently forget
Holy shit it's actually coming out
keep fuckingg send this shit to my phone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&feature=emb_title
feeling like this movie will be fantastic and tom holland is gonna rock it
Seems like a combination of a quiet place and the maze runner
arent the kids actually like 13-14 in the book?
Tom even hops/jumps like spiderman in this movie
I hope the film does the book justice because it is one of the most powerful set of books I have ever read. A bit concerned that they named the first film after the entire trilogy, I really hope that doesn't mean they plan on cramming more than one book into one film...
Looks laughably bad; yet better than Star Wars TLJ/ROS?
IM SO EXCITED TO SEE DAISY RIDLEY IN ANOTHER FILM LETS GOOOO!! ^-^
Lol can’t wait for this movie to tank
Lol can’t wait for this movie to tank
OMFG I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT SINCE I FINISHED READING THE TRILOGY BACK IN DEC-JAN THANK U LIONSGATE.
Can we not think?
Notice how Disney owns all of the people in this movie
Looks really good. Spider-Man, Rey, and Hannibal all in one movie is pretty awesome too.
anyone here to hear Jonah Scott briefly voice for Nick Jonas?
Well, this is going on to list
All men and one woman? More like "The Great Raping"
Inzo Overthinker music will be good for the credits.

The  ABCs of Salvation, or how to be right with God, and know you're going to Heaven:  A-dmit that you're a sinner, and need a Savior.  As it is written: There is none righteous, no, not one. Romans 3:10  For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Romans 3:23  B-elieve that Jesus Christ died paying the penalty for your sins, and rose from the grave.  He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross. 1 Peter 2:24  For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures... 1 Corinthians 15:3-4  C-all on the Lord Jesus Christ to save you, and trust only in Him for your salvation.  If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9  For whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. Romans 10:13  The moment you "believe," or, put your trust in what Jesus has done for you, God saves you and your eternal destiny in Heaven is assured. You go from spiritual death to eternal life the moment you believe.  Jesus said it this way: Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life. John 5:24😀

reading the end of this trilogy made me cry like a baby. i doubt this adaption will do the same but i'm so excited to see it come to fruition.
i wonder how they keep their ATM passcodes secret.
Mads Mikkelsen is a legend. Put his name in the video title.
I've watched this more than 7 times already. I'm so excited
Man, I loved the books, I always wondered how they would get the whole seeing everyone's thoughts across on screen.  I never read the last book, so maybe it's time I re-read them all.
Damn!! Me, as a fan of marvel universe and jonas brothers was looking for tom holland's new movie and i found this trailer and shockingly i found nick jonas in this clip!!! What a lucky me!!! I will not miss this movie, i will not.
BRUH FINALLY
from the devil all the time to this??? tom holland might be the best actor
Men's thoughts on display for everyone to see: the future liberals want.

I like how Nick Jonas's character says, "You better watch your noise." and not "you better watch your mouth".
i had no idea that new concepts can still be developed...niiice
Fuuuuck!! Finally!!!
So Daisy is allowed to keep her accent but Tom isn’t? Lol
Tom Holland, Daisy Ridley and Mads Mikkelsen in the same movie together. Peter Parker, Rey and Gealan Erso and Le Chiffre. Well, I’m watching this 😂😂😂😂
0:31 typical all-boys discord chat when one girl joins in
I want expecting to love the trailer. I wish they'd made a deal to release it on Netflix too.
What, sir, would the people of the earth be without woman? They would be scarce, sir, almighty scarce - Mark Twain
Looks like a post apocalyptic world yet she has clearly dyed blonde hair aha pretty distracting and emersion breaking aha
Damn, where are all the jokes about no one being able to see the movie because there will probably still be a virus fucking up the world. Gonna be a long while before we all get the new vaccines.
Hell yeah I'm watching that.
Tom Holland is the future star.
This trailer would finally come out in 2020.
Yo the new spider-man looks different!
Is this the new predator universe movie???
Is this Spider-Man?
Poor Mads Mikkelsen. He just wants a peaceful life.
Jsem zvědavá...Kniha byla super :)
Is the dog going to be okay?
thats an expensive looking Imogen Poots
Sorry.. I personally thought that it sucked being your friend this way
Tom Holland just can't keep quiet, can he?
Finally!!!!!!! I remember reading this book!!
💪💪💪💞💞💞💞
THIS LOOKS LIKE AN AMAZING SCI-FI ACTION THRILLER WITH A GREAT A STORY LOVE IT!!!
any book fans here??? i think it looks NOTHING like the book omg
Good to see Daisy Ridley's career isn't ruined by Star Wars.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKCThllyGtQ
this looks EPIC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
Use a better thumbnail though
My adhd will protect me against people understanding my thoughts
joylavita.com
I’m so exited I feel like I’m 15 again omfg
0:20 Seriously this gave me "After earth" (Jaden Smith)  feeling.
love the aesthetic
What is this?
where are the black people?
Spidey senses running on an overdrive!
Who want this in tamil dubbed???
Tom Holland as gargamel
Going to feel like years befor it's out
Ahh yes, Daisy Ridley returns with her incredible ‘eyes wide, mouth slightly open’ form of acting
It's look more fancy,  than Dune remake 👍
IVE WAITED YEARS FOR THIS TRAILER. Literally YEARS
I want this movie in Hindi dubbed
How do they not mention Mads Mikkelson in the video’s title? 🤦🏻‍♂️
ok...lets start from the beginning....what the fack ijj thees?
ive never seen a girl before...so tom plays a simp?
Never read the book but this looks like a rly interesting concept! Hope its good and the cast is already fantastic. Good for daisy that the bad star wars movie didn‘t stop her career. She is such a talent actress
This one gives me Goosebumps
Trailer is as chaotic as the name of the movie. Hope the movie is good.
Why does he always have a pimple?
Couldn't make heads or tails of that. Is he pulling animals out of thin air and talking to his Twitter followers as holograms?
Mads Mikkelsen name should have been up there. He's so incredible.
Uh what this is hype i should look into the book ig
I recognize that sound effect from METROID PRIME!!!
Waiting for the new character of Tom Holland
I believe in Daisy Ridley supremacy 😌
These books are my absolute favourite, I've read the trilogy three times. For anyone who's thinking about reading them - do it!!
Hopefully she won’t hear our thoughts about the Star Wars Sequel Trilogy....
THESE BOOKS ARE MY ABSOLUTE LIFE AND THEY KEPT CHANGING THE RELEASE MOVIE DATE BUT FINALLY
I had no idea that chaos walking was a thing. But it has tom holland and daisy ridley in it I’m watching it
Im regular person. I see Daisy Ridley's name. I click
I’m happy daisy ridley is acting, she got so much shit fir Star Wars that wasn’t her fault
I'm a simple man. If she reads my mind it would be 'EXE stop working' and then after reboot she'll see every creepy stuff
This looks great!
Omg Tom Holland's movies are really good. I should watch out for this one.
This looks cool
Will you please stop flexing having read the books?!!
I thought daisey ridley was complaining that no one would hire her
"on this planet, all the men's thoughts are on full display" ....so, Earth then?
ayo rey changed the look
Dont know the story, but it looks interresting.
Actually looks interesting
Okay ihve always liked the idea of being able to read people's mind.  But not to be killed because of it xD.
This looks interesting. Just got the audiobook and thought about the kindle version too. Wanna read it before the movie comes out.
OOOOH it looks amazing
really bad
So they literally making what if she is the one woman on the planet. Will u fuck her? For star wars fans. They know how star wars can hate Daisy Ridley for running Luke Skywalker legacy.
Какой дурак на Плюке правду думает
My sister has the books... she hates the cast of this movire
This looks horrible.
Wow. In some scenes Tom Holland looks 15 years old, and in others he looks in his mid-20s.
I can’t believe there’s already a remake of What Men Want
A new world is coming...?
I'm the circle and the circle is me.
no joke i couldn’t live in this world. i’ve got intrusive thoughts 24/7
tom holland and nick jonas? wow. who knew I'd need that duo in my life
this movie will make you cry because i cried so much working on it, like, comment, subscribe and please share to your friends, love ones and enemies https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emfpH8PKU7k
Blonde Daisy is kinda fresh
Am I the only one who really doesn’t like this adaptation? Maybe it’s because I’m a hardcore book fan but I really don’t like what they’ve done with the characters 😬
Tom Holland can't act
"Omg~ wanna bang wanna bang wanna bang"
Only woman on the planet and she can here our thoughts..... Brilliant!!
Eielson AFB in a nutshell
This looks amazing! I'm going to look for the book while I wait for it to come out
I've just never seen a girl before .... writers am I right?!
I'd just be thinking that's the girl that ruined starwars and all the shit that doesn't make sense in those 3 movies.
She is the only girl in the planet makes me think only one thing that of what the Tom Holland character is going to protect her from.  'THE MEN'
DOES HANNIBAL EAT SPIDERS?
Why is there a trailer for the trailer in the beginning of the trailer that I'm watching?
I love movies like this!
Think like a man post apocalyptic style.
Why didn’t they just name it like the book?
Daisy is still uglier than ever!
Controlling Peter tingle can be hard!
This is problematic for people who randomly have funny fcked up thoughts cross their heads.
Looks SWEET! Can't wait for January! I started looking into the series right after watching this trailer.
Sir, I hope u release this movie in Hindi also.
Basically a movie saying “who’s the bigger simp” that’s funny
I thought the girl was Dylan Sprouse :/
2020 is worse than Chaos walking
Hit like for chaos walking 👇
Fun fact: the author of the Chaos Walking books is Patrick Ness, the same who wrote A monster calls, whose movie is also amazing and was made by J.A. Bayona. The same director who "discovered" Tom Holland on The Impossible when he was younger. In fact, Tom participated in A monster calls as a stand in actor for the monster, helping Bayona so that the protagonist had someone to react to on scene. Pretty cool.
bro this is nothing like the books wtf why have they made it dystopian
Whenever I walk into a games store Dudes: Oh my god it's a girl!!?!?
Its Rey using the jedi mind trick on spiderman
I'm waaaaay into blonde Daisy Ridley.
1:04 See you know in the Maze Runner when one girl shows up amongst all those boys? That was bad enough and then she immediately marks our main character out by saying his name? I thought Thomas was dead meat, I was glad it totally side stepped into other territory. This here, looks to be a more (pessimistic much? Yes) realistic version. And her reaction...appropriate. Yep, I'm here to see how this chaos plays.
Qui Gon, Rey and Spidey. Noice

Im reading the book right now ❤️
1:27 I love the idea of being able to visualize your thoughts!
Does the Skywalker forgot her Lightsaber?
The character of mayor is so good and interesting in the books that if mads bring his Hannibal game here he could possible have a Oscar nod or win
So the Men don't know what she's thinking.. That's every Woman's super power...
I ship them... I haven’t read the book so don’t attack me haha
If everyone could hear my thoughts, they'd be in for a lot of nothing
This is what the inside of my head looks like
I done reads this all of book series. And i loved..
What the hell ‼️ It's coming soon.. 😭😭😭😭😭 What is the realise date guys. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Subliminal messaging throughout this trailer. The globalist elites already know so much about us through our online information, search history, social media, and more. Tom Holland says "how do I know you don't want to hurt me" and "I want to protect you," which is a way the elite want to get us to accept it when we become a full-on surveillance state. The movie is about everybody knowing about our own thoughts.
name of song anyone?
This looks cool. They couldn’t find anyone better than Daisy Ridley? She was a pit of despair in Star Wars.
Mann I really thought this was already the trailer for Uncharted🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Daisy "I like your dog" Ridley
can't wait to see daisy again 🤧🤧
FINALMENTE VEIO AÍ
I'm spending the entirety of 2021 in a movie theater
I'm gonna read the book, Now📚
So, Daisy has become Hollywood's not so attractive but powerful young woman who travels through space, all men tend to ask her who are you, hear voices in her head and fights with them? Hollywood really doesn't have shame. Daisy please get another agent you can do better than this.
i am going to get the book tomorrow!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I cant wait to read it and watch the movie in two months cant wait!
What!
TV show
This looks good. I may consider going to see it in 2021.
Tom Holland is in everything now good for him
For anyone scrolling through the comments going through a really hard time I truly hope things get better for you no matter who you are. Please don't give up trying. There is a reason you are here reading this message, to remind you that YOU are so important to God and His Son Jesus Christ. I can only imagine what you are going through but God knows.  I also know how difficult life can be and I may not understand your exact experience but I am truly sorry that things have been so tough for you. I care and want you to know that you are not alone, you have a purpose, you are worthy of so much. Please take it one day at a time, one step at a time.  I am praying that God will send His angels to each and everyone of you to comfort you, surround you with His love, give you peace beyond measure, and to change things for the better.  Please know that you are here for a reason and that sometimes we don't always know why we go through things, maybe to help someone else going through the same thing because you understand such pain that someone else may not.   Please also know you also have a Savior Jesus Christ who died for you, He loves you more than you could ever know. Please ask Him for forgiveness of wrongs and ask Him into your heart believing with sincerity. ( Please see the book the Holy Bible for more information) He can guide you in all things. I speak from experience it doesn't matter what we have done or that we think we don't measure up He will meet us where we are, even in our lowest low. He can give you peace beyond measure, I speak from experience. I can only imagine how hard it has been for you but I truly hope the best is yet to come for all of you. Please never give up, because He won't give up on us. Please remember this when things are hard and you feel at the end of your rope.  To give your life to Jesus Christ here is a sample prayer: Dear Lord Father in Heaven I admit I am a sinner. I have done many things that don't please you. I have lived my life for myself only. I am sorry and I repent. I ask you to forgive me.  I believe that you died for me to save me. You did what I could not do for myself. I come to you now and ask you to take control of my life; I give it to you. From this day forward, help me to live every day for you in a way that pleases you. I love you Lord, and I thank you that I will spend eternity with you, In Jesus name I pray, amen..............
intresting
this is the first book right?
🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
I’m so intrigued!! It looks good. The length of production is scaring me though.
The movie soo good that it got delayed for years YA novel adaptations aren't even the in thing anymore. Producers must have plenty of confidence in it
Your mind is a weapon. Use it as you deem fit
Yay... Another male led cast saving one damsel in distress. Way to to Hollywood. 👎🏻
I’m seeing this cuz of Tom Holland! 😍
Never gonna see it cause I hate Daisy Ridley
Honestly didn't think this was ever getting finished, pretty excited now!
“And it feels like, finally.”
Hunger Games 4 looks cool.
As someone who read like all the books years ago, I was extremely excited when the publishers started slapping the “soon to be a motion picture” line on them. When I found out that chaos walking the movie was getting more and more likely to turn out badly, credits to looper, I gave up hope.  BUT I SWEAR TO GOD I SCREAMED WHEN I SAW THIS
OH my Bloody God this is gonna rock!!!
I’m actually really excited to see this!
Tom Holland net worth is gonna be so damn high after 2020 and 2021 i feel like he never sleeps 💤 😴
.................. no.
I love the books but don’t know if I like the vibe of the film 😭😭
The music makes this unwatchable.
When’s the ‘coming soon’ tho??
Retire this music in the trailer. Never again. So annoying.
Finally, Spider Camp Rock Wars. The movie we’ve all been waiting for !
*As long as there is no Mary Sue cheat codes or op plot armor, this could be a decent movie to watch*
morjjens, madgalena akahhjne. she makes god weep, you realize.
Yeesh. It looks so bad I can't help but cringe my face hurts
This looks awesome as fuck
One thing for sure if there’s one movie that I am not looking forward to seeing is  the devil in the white city and it’s the story of the serial killer known as H H Holmes and he is famous for the murders at the 1893 worlds fair Columbian exposition which a distant relative of mine named Maggie Deaner was at and I know Maggie was there because my paternal grandmother has a teacup with Maggie’s name on it but Holmes was a monster because Holmes said that “I was born with the devil in me. I could not help the fact that I was a murderer no more than the poet can help the inspiration to sing- I was born with the evil one meaning the devil standing as my sponsor beside the bed where I was ushered into the world, and he has been with me since and also Holmes murded his accomplices two children by doing what the nazis did at concentration camps and he worked at a drugstore and he gave medicine to a child and the child died from the medicine and he killed his employer’s The Holtons and his former medical school classmate and his accomplice Benjamin Pitezel
Imagine holding a boring business meeting on this planet
Background music 👍
HOLY CRAP IM SO EXCITED AND IT ACTUALLY LOOKS GOOD YESSSSSS GIVE THE BOOK WHAT IT DESERVES
Another Faad magician
Duude I read this book it was sooo goood, I can’t believe that are making a Ligit movie
As bad as the movie probably is, the premise does sound interesting
Spiderman not in home
It's sort of wild how this was filmed almost 4 Years ago now.
The book was amazing, this cast is amazing, if this movie follows the book, it’ll be the best movie ever 😭🥰
I feel like I know exactly how this movie is gonna play out
Way too much info going on. Looks good, though the mysterious allure seems lacking now.
You seriously caption Nick Jonas in the title and not Mads Mikkelsen? Like... why?
Interesting 🧐 concept
I've been waiting forever for this series to be brought to the movie scene!
MADS FUCKING MIKKELSEN !!!
Hopefully she gives us a better performance then that awful star wars trilogy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
Jesus tom is working on 3 movies rn
FINALLYYYYYYYYY
This looks eeepppiiiccc
Finally this movie came out Even just the trailer came out
I'm not like "Tenent" movie trailer confused, but I also mostly don't know what I just watched...
I read the book when I was about 14 or something and now I’m 26 and I was looking forward to this, but there’s some stuff that doesn’t appear in the book and they also haven’t done the hearable thinking justice. The book had bold text and repetitions of words and intrusive language all around.
The book is soo good I hope the adaptation does it justice
Ok since manchee is in the movie that mean do we have to watch him DIE-
The spackle guys THE SPACKLE AND MANCHEE IS THE CUTEST THING EVER
This movie better have a bomb ass soundtrack
I don't get it.
Sooooo.....is this one huge anti man movie...or not?
Holy crap this is the best cast for any movie ever
Forbes published a report titled “Will We Get To The Bottom Of The Truth On Forced Organ Removal In China?” by Ewelina U. Ochab on March 21, 2019.   Reenactment of the Chinese Communist Party's state-sanctioned organ harvesting from living Falun Gong practitioners in Hong Kong on January 12, 2013.  The Forbes article began by mentioning the UN International Day for the Right to the Truth Concerning Gross Human Rights Violations and for the Dignity of Victims.  The author went on to describe the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) state-sanctioned organ harvesting from living prisoners of conscience, “Over recent years, several researchers (including lawyers and investigators) have been raising the issue of forced organ removal in China, namely, the illegal practice of removing organs from individuals who did not consent to it.”  It continued, “Despite China arguing that there are approximately 10,000 organ transplants being conducted in China per year, all in accordance with the law, researchers suggest that this is far from the truth. Indeed, researchers indicate that the numbers of such transplants are closer to between 60,000 and 100,000 a year, significantly higher than the official Chinese estimate.”  The perpetrators of the crime are officials of the CCP, acting in collaboration with surgeons, prison authorities, and military officials.  Researchers found that most of the organs were obtained through illegal forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience, including Falun Gong, Tibetan Buddhists, Uighurs, and house Church Christians.  The prisoners of conscience die from the forced organ removal, or more accurately, they are being killed in the process.
Is this movie will be dub in hindi and release in India !?????😳🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Omg finally Patrick Ness’ work is getting recognition, so hyped so see this 🤩
It’s not shaky cam just shot on an iPhone
This is so dope, to have ur thoughts on display.
Yasss tom holland and daisy ridley, this looks cool 😍  i hope next year this pandemic will be gradually over so i could watch in cinema again 😭
ITS GALEN ERSO! AND PETER PARKER! oh. and rey.
I'm so mad that this keeps threatening to be good. I love the books so so much and I'd rather it be a huge disaster than this movie that is shaping up to be decent enough
Wait there is a danish actor in here
I'm soooooo excited the knife of never letting go is one of my favorite books
A world like this for people who suffer from depression would be a literal cancer on society.
Whoever didn't like this video was so excited that they didn't see the like button.
Start:-Nothing new End:-wauw
Was that nick Jonas
Great, a movie about men being horrible and women being the only good. Whoever said Hollywood put their liberal agenda in movies is crazy. THATS SARCASM. Whoever Daisy Ridley's agent is, is doing a horrible job, he just put her in ANOTHER movie where she's the one hope for everyone. GOD I HATE LIBERALS
Me: *Happy and excited* Also me: Remember when his dog......
Did they seriously not mention Mads Mikkelsen in the video title? SMH!
THE MOVIE THAT WAS CONSIDERED SO BAD THAT THE STUDIO WOULD RATHER HIDE IT IN SHAME THAN RELEASE IT, SO TROUBLED THAT MOST OF THE CAST UNFOLLOWED THE DIRECTOR, THIS MOVIE IS ACTUALLY COMING OUT IM SO HYPED

How the fuck did scrawny ass Tom Holland get all these non-spiderman related action films?
Does Tom ever sleep?
It's like they made a movie out of stars wars backlash 😅
So Hannibal, Spiderman and Rey Palpatine are in a post apocalyptic space fantasy together and it looks like an ad for "The 100" tv show.... After watching the trailer it looks like a mix of Annihilation and Cowboys & Aliens...
Dumb
Wo this video is wonderful  magic , animation , action or sc-fec  I watched first to released https://youtu.be/GYXpt6RqN3g
How can a movie look so yood and so bad?
Mads is a legend.
Viola the painful
Nick Jonas boutta make me die laughing (fr tho I love his character)
After reading "the knife of never letting go" (the book its based on) i rlly wanna watch this film
This does not look good.
Who read the book and waited a million years for the movie?
oh my god daisy ridley is so gorgeous, also IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO THAT DOG I WILL LOSE MY MIND
Spiderkid in uncharted territory.
Trailer Is Really Fire🔥🔥🔥...👌👌👌
This map looks like the one from Fortnite
Please Dubb in Hindi language for Indians ...
How can *YOU* have *SALVATION* and *ETERNAL LIFE?*  1) *YOU* have *SINNED* (Romans 3:23) 2) The wages of *YOUR* sin is separation from God and death, in the *ETERNAL FLAMES OF HELL* (Romans 6:23) 3) To avoid this fate and go to heaven, *YOU* must be *PERFECT* because God is *PERFECT* (Revelation 21:27) 4) *YOU* will never be perfect because *YOU* have sinned, so *YOU* need a *SAVIOUR* since *YOU* cannot earn heaven by *YOUR* works (Ephesians 2:8-9) 5) Jesus Christ *IS* God; who came in the flesh, lived a *PERFECT* life and died as a *SUBSTITUTE* for *YOU,* so *YOU* don't have to pay the penalty for *YOUR* sins (2 Corinthians 5:21). 6) All God demands is that *YOU BELIEVE* in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ; that *HIS BLOOD* washes away *ALL* of *YOUR* sins and makes *YOU PERFECT* (John 3:16, John 6:47, Romans 10:9-10, 1 Corinthians 15:1-4). 7) Now *YOU* cannot go to hell because *YOU* have *NO* sins to pay for. Jesus *PAID* for *ALL* of *YOUR* sins. *YOU* have received the *FREE GIFT* of *ETERNAL LIFE* (1 John 5:13).
Its so odd seeing tom holland fight without super powers. Dudes 90 pounds soaking wet. Goooood luck.
So Chaos is Walking. What's the big deal? I walk all the time... 😅
Man, disney made a weird star wars/mcu crossover.
Imagine Tom Holland's character in this movie accidentally spoils the  next Spiderman film 🤣
This and the Dune remake have me hyped!!!
YES FINALLY OH MY GONNA GO REREAD THE TRILOGY BRB
Tom and Mads are going to be epic! Actually looking forward to a movie for once...
Anyone know the name that high pitched sound in it that’s like “eh”? I need to know
1:39 "Forget Everything You Know"  Star Wars fans: Prequels lead to anger, Anger leads to hate, Hate leads to suffering. Forget those we must
So..Spiderman, Ray Palpatine and Nick Jonas
In some shots Tom Holland have that look which makes me think he could potentially play amazing villian someday. Just something in his eyes... its not my friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, and its really cool )
Daisy Ridley in MCU Spiderman as real Mary Jane or Gwen Stacy that doesn't die, get rid of the current MJ in some way, get rid of the Ned who can't act and annoying as fuck, and make Pete Parker a photographer again, and improve cinematography and color grading like in the level of The Amazing Spiderman please.... Sony, please. As perfect as Tom Holland is to be perfect as Peter Parker and Spiderman, you're ruining everything else.  Just a short open letter to MCU's Spiderman, please excuse me for posting it here. I just saw that Dais Ridley could be great in the Spiderman Story. It reminded me how the current Spiderman could be so much greater.  A lot of people will probably get triggered, and some will surely respond with uncentered mind, but if you're a filmmaker, a story teller, not just bandwagon joiner, not a dumb consumer who just get sucked into how marketing manipulates them, or a real fan of Spiderman as a character and a story, you'll understand what I mean.  1. Peter Parker is no longer a photographer. You made him just a fucking godamn annoying generic teenager without unique traits. If he didn't have powers, he's just a smart kid who's horny. Seriously, Peter being a photographer is like one of the unique things about his character and a big inspiration to many. Now you made him just a regular teenager with no depth and is just there to quench the thirst of fanboys and use him to support the MCU franchise. Even in his solo movies, it's too dependent on Avengers. Story wise, plot wise, etc.   2. Majority of his classmates as side characters cannot fucking act. And are just annoying as fuck. And they have little to no contribution to the story at all.  3. Aunt May and Happy. What the fuck?!! It makes sense to make Aunt May as young as a real Aunt and not like a grandma, but jesus. She's 9-10 and Happy is 2-3 at most and a bad character unless you're close to him, or he works for you, or if your hot. Also, there is no chemistry at all, their match is unrealistic, there's no fucking reason why that would've happened, and again MCU is just fucking driving the Spiderman franchise into some fucking annoying mix of whatever the fuck they want without thinking of The Spiderman a whole story.  4. Let's talk about Karen and his suit.  Spiderman is ruined. What makes him amazing mainly aside from his web and other abilities, IS HE IS STRONG AND VERY SMART. And HIS SPIDER SENSE IS A BIG PART OF HIS STRENGTH together from his physical strength. Yet you put Karen; an AI into his suit. The fuck? In the boat scene in homecoming, the real Spiderman would've solved the problem by his thinking, fixed it with his abilities. But fucking no!  They just godamn threw the intelligence of Spidey and Peter, made him asked the AI in the suit to fucking analyze and solve the problem. Even the different types of web. Peter could've made those himself. He doesn't and shouldn't have needed Ironman. He's not really a mentor. He's just mainly a fucking sponsor to Peter.        What makes him unique as well is that he makes is own stuff because he is smart. Even in the Into the Spiderverse, you can see Peter had a lair. In a lot of versions in comics and games, you can see how smart he is. But you threw all that away and had Ironman give everything he needs. He's no longer the Spiderman and Peter Parker who works hard to do what he has to do. NOW HE'S JUST A LUCKY KID WHO HAS SUPER SPONSORS. Really? Fuck! That's not Spiderman. I get that you did it because you needed the plot to tie him in the MCU but fuck. This is not the way. You made him a generic teenager, not even a photographer. No fucking unique trait. Nothing special about his character writing except that he's lucky he got the powers, and he's lucky to have a super rich sponsor. Peter Parker is very smart, could fucking make his own suit, and even build his entire tech empire. Instead you made him into a godamn privileged teenager who didn't really have to start in the starting line and work himself from it.  HE'S NOW BASICALLY AN IROMAN RIP OFF WITHOUT MISSILES AND ROCKETS WHO GOT EVERYTHING HE NEEDS FROM BEING LUCKY.  5. Story is bad. Mostly bad. There are amazing moments, but you can't really get sense of Peter Parker or Spiderman at all. His character, his story. You don't really feel it. It's just a mix of hyped stuff, mixed in with bigger cooked movies and characters it rides on. On its own, if it wasn't part of the MCU franchise, it's just a bad version of Spiderman series. Really. I love Tom Holland and I like the MCU but the really ruined Spiderman. Turned into a Piñata to satisfy the sales and the bigger franchise; MCU.  6. Cinematography and Color Grading is bad or at least not great. Well, it's generic and mediocre.  It sucks like in most MCU movies. I hate how they don't have the eyes or care to fucking hire a great cinematographer, to improve the cinematography, color grading, etc. Doctor Strange and some stuff was good, but most even the Civil War was just fucking bad and mediocre. As many bandwagon joiners who love to hate on The Amazing Spiderman, it wasn't perfect but if you wash your eyes and watch it without the saturation of marketing and hype, you'll see how superior The Amazing Spiderman is. Every scene is like a painting, carefully composed, shot, graded, etc. Story wise, it had a heart and it was amazing. Not just a fucking plot device for the bigger franchise and thirst quencher for fanboys.  7. Even the theme song is bad, but MCU is so fucking focused on pleasuring the fanboys that they still use it. Jesus. Into The Spiderverse was great without it being the main theme song, and whatever music and sound design they used became iconic on its own. God I fucking hate the Spiderman theme song. Take off the nostalgia and it's just a bad song from the past.   If you're not super hyped up by how the MCU markets and saturates the movies, and see what they're doing to Spiderman, you'll understand.
Yk what this sounds like the season 100 like the same back story😂
So I'm relieved and dissapointed that daisy ridley kinda seems like she can actually act, so as usual it was just disney star wars that was the problem, thos looks pretty cool
Got me at Mads Mikkelsen
Spider-Man and Rey “Skywalker.” A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
As long as the movies follows the book plot almost exactly then it should be good
In the thumbnail, that man looks nothing like tom holland xD.. I know its him, but he looks like he has blue eyes and really strong cheekbones.. Its so weird.. he looks like an old man, but a young man at the same time, I'm a little disturbed..
Trippy!
What happened to this being unreleasable
Hellz yes
Huh. Peter Parker and Rey Skywa*choke* Rey Skywalk*cough*. I’m sorry. I can’t say the full thing
Daisy's acting method of leaving her mouth half open at all times seems to be  going strong
So Rey crash landed on planet Twitter.
Wow have we lived to see this movie finally come out!?  P.s. was this filmed in Vancouver? That shot with the pine trees and the lake
I can't watch anything with Daisy Ridley in it. 🤮
Rey or Leeloo?
The looks like just another convoluted, uninteresting YA flop
Am I the only person you think it looks a little weird with Daisy and blond hair because it’s her face but it’s just seems weird to me
Holy shit
Even in a science fiction no one cant read a womens mind...
I know it’s based on a book but wow something unique coming out of Hollywood? Interesting
This looks extremely confusing and enjoyable
Hey, can we stop editing trailers like this?   No?   Of course not..
I really like tom Holland and Ridley is okay but this looks kinda awful. Also the years of RE shoots and delays plus all the stuff they had to fix post production, almost a guarantee the movie is not good.
This movie kinda looks like trash...
Who...are ..you?  I'm Rey Skywalker
the movie looks amazing, but why did they have to put all 3 books into one movie :(
Wasn’t this supposed to be in unfilmable? Or it’s just become unwatchable
Came for Mads. The rest meh.
Omg, I love this book!! I remember reading it when it was first released as part of a shortlist in order to pick our own book for the Booker prize (I think it was that one?) in school back in year 9 like 10 years ago and it’s still one of my favourites. Can’t wait to watch it
Being the last woman on earth has got be hard especially in a world full of men
nice casting choice  not a super hero movies fan but looking forward......hope pain in the ass corona ends soon and we can enjoy movies on big screen in pakistan
am I the one who thinks the girl looks like Dylan Sprouse ????😶😶
FINALLY, hopefully this is as good as the book
The fuck they list those two at the end and not Mads?  The disrespect he's literally the only reason any of us are excited about this movie.  😁
Good trailer
Good cast, but looks like shit
Oh yay I thought they cancelled this film!
Wait so jojo
Woah! This looks so cool, even if it ends up not being like the books. I always hate it when movies aren’t like the books and they’re bad, I’ll watch them over and over if they aren’t like the books but still good!
Why has Daisy Ridley been given more roles after what she did in Star Wars 💀
Me: oh my God I’m so excited I should go read the books   Also me: three books! I’m too lazy to read that ima just wait for the movie
Omg this looks so dope
This looks really really bad... I'm sorry but this is such a stupid movie idea.. thought bubbles, Daisy Rey-sue and aliens?  I'll probably never get a chance to write in Hollywood, I know that, but I am confident I can write something better than this turd. Millions of dollars for a movie we ALL know is going to flop.
this looks horrible.
I think this movie plot looks complicated enough to be a success or a failure.
It’s nice to see Tom Holland’s acting career start to take off
I got goosebumps i love these books so much.
NICK HI
Madds Mikkelson is so underrated and underappreciated. He’s bigger than daisy ridley and they can’t even put his name on the credit of this preview!!? Crazy...
Love the books but a bit pessimistic about this film... I hope they set the scene properly and explain what’s going on before jumping in with too much action.
If the dog dies im out
This looks interesting. What a horrifying idea it is being the last woman on earth. 😱
Finally a trailer
I could totally see a parody where we see what's really on his mind when a hot girl just shows up out of nowhere
A movie starring two actors that that a lot of crap for no reason. I think it looks interesting enough that I'd give it a watch.
Haha
Needs more mumbling
None of this trailer was a spoiler if y’all read the books
So After Earth 2, after Will. But for real, I felt like I saw pictures on this like 5 years ago... How long has this been in production
Thanks, I can fill in the rest. Why see the movie now?
Boring Walking
i really thought this was going to be such a ironic good movie (so bad its good) but instead it is just super meh looking   daisy Ridley still can't act for shit though
We usually get these kind of films as TV series. It’s refreshing to see something like this coming to the big screens
How do the men uh.. procreate without women there
Looking dope ngl
Looks great thou
I don't care if everyone, including the main leads, die in the movie but not a single scratch must come to the dog. Not a single scratch.
Damn Tom Holland is in everything atm. I love it too!
FINALLLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Hopefully it’s good because this film was shot three years ago. Not only that but it had many reshoots.
Rey traveled to the wrong franchise and met Spiderman
Looking forward to this, somehow though I'm a pretty voracious reader I've never came across this??
Geez talk about obsessive ruminating disorder
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos ⭕️
The squidward apparition https://youtu.be/qNErGPayaxU
90% of the people saying “you haven’t read the books have you” literally haven’t read anything in years if not ever
Girl look like another transgender men actor
The MCU + Star Wars + Jumanji=                            Marvel Studio’s          Star Wars: Jumanji’s Final Game
1:00 where are all the women.. They're dead   Simps: Well Hail the only queen
God dammit.. I keep hearing Peter Parker whenever Tom talks.. It seems like I can't separate the two
That new Star Wars movie looks pretty cool
gay.
Made with "Netflix-Generator.exe"
Lmao Tom Holland is an incel
Lol they're literally telling all of you what's about to happen and none of you can see it. Open your eyes, wake up. Time is short.
1:27 my favorite part of the trailer
What happened with american actors are they still working?
This is just about bad movie trailer cliche.
Movieproducers, actors and the whole story making team: 2:17  Tom: 2:18 Every talkshow in the world: 2:23
Tom Holland: Who are you? Daisy: Rey Skywalker Tom Holland: Not that shit again...
FINALLY
I'm a simple guy I see Tobey Maguire, i click
why are women dead? Lol if this movie included only women and all the men were dead 🤣🤣 the uproar of incels would be ASTRONOMICAL
Daisy Ridley is a bad actress...
If you haven't read the books then you should. Patrick Ness is an amazing writer. I'm happy this film is finally on its way but it's taken far too long
I’ve always wondered what Rey and Spider-Man would look lik onscreen together
Looks cool but ooooooohhhh booooooyy i can smell the feminist bs coming.
Didn’t they postpone this movie because it was so terrible/unwatchable???
An ok looking movie but I was taken off once I saw based on a best seller line.
I feel like this is gonna be one of those flashy trailer cool concept things but a let down in the end. Hopefully i'm wrong🥴
It's kind of like reverse World's end harem
This looks stupid about the thoughts but still watchable atleast once for me ill be checking this out when it comes out.
Girl's name = Viola Orchestra people: *dying of laughter*
WE HAVE WAITED YEARS AND ITS FINALLY HAPPENING surely!
Oh my gosh I loved this book! I forgot they were making a movie out of it!
Wait so im confused, thoughts are visible and physical? Why? And why arent there any women?
This film look terrrrryyy bell
My favorite actors are wearing trashbags and they are beautiful.
Good to see that Star Wars has not ruined her career.
Looks like crap 😃
This looks so amazing! Can't wait to see it!
I see Mad Mikkelsen, I become interested.
I'd better not see a dead dog. I'll be writing some strong words to the scriptwriter if I see one.
This planet would be a night mare for teenage males
This is the beginning of Tom Holland  adding mediocre and forgettable movies to this resume because of contracts and his management
I have disdain for whoever invented the trailer for trailers. Theyre  trying to hype me up for the hype up 😆 🤣

ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS!! FINALLY AFTER WAITING THREE YEAR THE MOVIE IS COMING OUT!!! LETS GO!
um, hell yeah
Hey, that looks like complete garbage. Thanks again 2020.
Wow this is gonna suck fat balls fam
Very smart movie for Ms. Ridley! Be a part of a movie with Tom Holland, who is an audience magnet, so that you can consequently show off your acting chops and subsequently distance yourself from the black hole that was the Star Wars sequels.
Lmao   DAISY RIDLEY STILL CANT CLOSE HER FUCKING MOUTH!
They better have "This is Man's World" as part of the soundtrack, it literally fits this movie.
Tom bout to spoil all of spiderman 3 in this movie
Just like the new mutants I forgot this movie existed
I'm really worried about that dog, especially in close proximity of Mads Mikkelsen. If they dare to kill the dog, there shall be chaos.
This movie would have been amazing in the Maze Runner Hunger Games era.
I read this book it was really good omg
I fucking hate Daisy Ridley. May be I hate Rey and Kyl so much.
Tom Holland : what is your name? Daisy Ridley : Rey Skywalker Tom Holland : owh... you using your made up names then I am Spider Man !
perfect planet for sherlock holmes
The book is amazing how the fuck did I not realise there was a movie on the way?
Looks good.
What an epic collaboration of stars. We've got Peter Parker/Spider-Man from the MCU/Marvel, we've got Rey from Star Wars, we've got a Jonas Brother as well as "Seaplane" McDonough from Jumanji, we've got Harriet Tubman, and the epic Mads Mikkelsen from multiple great movies and series.
When spider man's instinct become way to powerful
A Skywalker and a kid from queens Hmm interesting times
Well why does this look like a b grade movie Bad trailer cut
This is one of my favorite books. I hope this turns out well. I've had my doubts for quite some time.
I'm sorry, but all I could think about when Tom showed up around 30 seconds in is how every guy gets on mic when there's a girl in-game, and I'm dying.
I feel like I already watch entire movie like 90%.
wheres uncharted tom
I thought this movie was so awful that it got canned.
Been waiting for this one for the longest
Snake snake snake!!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
Maan, it would suck for all my thoughts to be on full display especially if i see a lady for the first time
I see daisy still has that emotionless-open mouth look she's famous for in starwars
Wtf how could you not put Madds name in the title yo
I didn't even recognize it was Daisy until she talked 😰
Fail. First off, nick jonas is in it so you know it's some MTV made movie type of shit. 2ndly it looks boring, let me guess they find a bunch of women at the end? I'm sure teens will flock to the movie due to its casting though.
Watching this because of Tom!!!! 100%!!!!
Don't care about anything!!! I just care about Tom!!!! 🤗🤗🤗
Rey, Peter Parker, and Galen Erso vs Predators
Unintentionally homoerotic planet
I just know Tom making hella bread
I thoroughly enjoyed these books. Please do not do them injustice
Lol... No views... Only 7 lakh
Ok I will watch though
This movie has a really sordid, sordid production history. I hope the actors’ ages don’t fluctuate throughout or anything like that
WTH is this?  Another feminist movie?

Dude, why isn't Mads in the headline? He's basically the reason I'll watch this.
My hubby is reading a book written about 5+yrs ago. It's  just like 2019&2020 an onwards. Name of bk. "The president is missing" Written by "James Patterson, and President Bill Clinton " I bought it at Walmart. (U can probably get it online.)
Tom's character reacting to a girl is exactly how I imagined Tom reacting.
Yes. Mads was phenomenal in the game death stranding.  Cant wait to see him in this movie
Nooo he is the worst actor ever
Can i just say the boat scene is going to....!!😭😭iykyk
No ice, chuckles!
Huh, this looks super interesting and unique.

🌅 His wisdom is profound, his power is vast. Who has resisted him and come out unscathed?  He moves mountains without their knowing it and overturns them in his anger.  He shakes the earth from its place and makes its pillars tremble.  He speaks to the sun and it does not shine; he seals off the light of the stars.  He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.  He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.  He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.  When he passes me, I cannot see him; when he goes by, I cannot perceive him.  If he snatches away, who can stop him? Who can say to him, ‘What are you doing?’  God does not restrain his anger; even the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet.  “How then can I dispute with him? How can I find words to argue with him?  Though I were innocent, I could not answer him; I could only plead with my Judge for mercy.  Even if I summoned him and he responded, I do not believe he would give me a hearing.  He would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds for no reason.  He would not let me catch my breath but would overwhelm me with misery.  If it is a matter of strength, he is mighty! And if it is a matter of justice, who can challenge him ?  Even if I were innocent, my mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would pronounce me guilty. Job 9:4‭-‬20 NIV https://bible.com/bible/111/job.9.4-20.NIV 🙏

Time to read the books now 😬😬😬😬
I think it’s time for me to read the books
I would die on that planet within 10 minutes by overthinking the many ways to die.
Me, an overthinker: yeah I've chosen death.
I'm excited! The book was so good!

Nick Jonas and Tom Holland I am so there
Men = bad , Women = Great .... I get it, got any other stupid narratives to sell? I mean seriously.... "The Noise is a man unfiltered, and without a filter, a man is just chaos walking" If that was instead: "The Noise is a human unfiltered, and without a filter, a human is just chaos walking".... That would be *ACCURATE* ... but to isolate *JUST* men in this.... *Fuck off.*

PATRIARCHY!!! 🤣🤣🤣
the trailer looks amazing
Me 2.5 minutes ago: Hooray!!! A new movie!  Me now: NVM. That looks shockingly stupid. Wouldn't see it in theaters, rent it, or even watch it for free on Netflix.
Kinda have a mixed feeling about this between the good plot of how their thoughts can be heard and seen, and the fact that this is just another young adult romance film. They were never good
Daisy ridley and Tom Holland? Fuck yes
Sooooo, is this supposed to be all three books in one?
Daisy Ridley blonde just looks like Cole Sprouse in a wig
They weren't kidding about the chaotic part.
THIS LOOKS SO GOOD
Cant wait to skip this film.
He's come so far from Billy Elliot wtf
When a Starwars universe collab with spider and Hannibal universe....
Is Nick Jonas an official horse rider for Hollywood movie ? He appeared everywhere as horse rider.
Spidey senses: Use web bomb! Villain: I heard that! Spidey: Wait what?!

What the spidey do there
I don't get it.
Does the dog die in this movie?
"In a world where women don't exist, and men can read each others minds."  I guess Hollywood's starting to run out of ideas.
I’d still take the 2021 in this film over our 2020
After 10000 years this movie is done. I might talk about it on my YouTube channel if it’s good enough 😂😂

So Alex (AKA Seaplane McDonough) teams up with a deranged/hypnotised Peter Parker and an alternative Rey Skywalker-Palpatine to defeat the ever villainous Hannibal Lecter?   I'm down for that.
I'm getting ADHD just watching this.

Jeremiah 4:30 says, ‘‘And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee. They will seek thy life’’  A Christian is not a sinner and a sinner is not a Christian(I John 3:9).If you must be a blessed child of God,you must repent of your sins and give your life to Jesus Christ.If you believe Jesus Christ today,righteousness of God will come into your life and abundant life will be your portion.If you neglect this call to repentance and salvation and die,you will not escape hell fire(Hebrews 2:3). Luke 13:3, Jesus said, ‘I tell you,Nay:but except ye repent,ye shall all likewise perish’.Matthew 6:33  If you have decided now to give your life to Jesus Christ and to forsake your sinful lifestyle, please pray this prayer: Almighty God, I come unto you in the name of Jesus. Father I confess that I am a sinner. All my sins I confess to you. I am very sorry for all my sins (mention those you can remember). Lord I promise you that from today I will never continue in them anymore. I believe that Jesus Christ died and rose again on the third day for my justification.  Almighty God, use the blood of Jesus to wash my sins away. Lord Jesus, come into my heart, be my Lord and personal Savior. I surrender my life to you. Cancel my name from the book of death and write it in the book of life. Give me power to sin no more. In Jesus name I pray. Amen!! 'THE LORD'S CHOSEN CHARIMATIC REVIVAL MOVEMENT'.

Wait... does Tom Holland have a Stand? I swear he just manifested a snake to kill nick jonas.
Most important Press Conference in American History.Not being covered by ANY news networks. Please Watch:  https://youtu.be/sq7TeUJwQD4
Tom Holland looks like... they just put in Tom from the real world into this movie. At least Daisy looks like an actual character.
Bruh what is that cursed Tom Holland face in the thumbnail
if that damn dog dies i swear
The quality looks great considering this movie was filming a thousand years ago
It's ironic the movie name considering its back stage production drama
Why does everyone keep wiping out the women in apocalypse movies?
So does he have special powers or anything since the man said "he's more powerful than he thinks"
Reverse Peter-Tingle
So what I got from the trailer- Romance, sci-fi, and fantasy
Very intriguing and suspenseful, me like
Starting: Spider-Man, Rey, and Clifford Unger
I see only Skywalker and Spider-Man 🤪🕷️
As a long time fan of this book series I can’t help feeling a little disappointed. The movie appears to be trying to be a fast paced high stakes dystopian adventure movie, which I feel truly misses the heart of these books. This story is about being a child being told you’re on the precipice of manhood yet not knowing how to confront all that entails. It’s about how the stories we tell about the past shape us, about what silence and our thoughts mean, about how to deal with the distortion of truth and how to make sense of an impossibly confusing world. These books are so heartfelt and genuine, and the action is only very secondary to the characters and their struggles, and I feel that this film is disregarding all of that to try and ride the long dead wave of big budget dystopian action movies that felt tired after the hunger games. Don’t get me wrong I’ll still go to see this movie but I’m just disappointed that a series I love so much will be so lacking
1:15 We even need glasses and we already get Tom Holland's Milo Thatch fom live action Atlantis: The Lost Empire
Finally!
MADSSSSS IM SO HAPPY IM GONNA DIE
i want it on netflix!!!!!
John 3.16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  Romans 6.23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
Yup, this trailer just summed up 2020.
Why does it seem the older he gets, the more Tom Holland looks like a mini Christian Bale...?
Looks dumb
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.”  #LordJesusiscoming

Something's just shouldn't be turned into films, let's hope this is good though.
So what's this movie about?
Imagine all of Tom Holland’s lines in a heavy Romanian accent.  If they’re not gonna let him use his real voice at least let him experiment with something a little different.   “I’VE NEVER SEEN A GIRL BEFORE” but as the count from Sesame Street
Me when I realize there's tom holland and NICK JONASSS in this movie: 👁👄👁  COUNT ME IN BITCHESSS

Overthinking : The Movie
Super trailer I am daisy ridley fan from srilanka
He’s still acting like Peter Parker
Between this, and Dune! 2021 is already looking great.
I'm here because of Mads Mikkelsen
get saved in christ right now before it's to late. just pray that you believe he died for your sins and that he is your Lord and savior then tell him to enter your life. when you say this that dead spirit in you comes alive, your born again, soul is saved from hell, name written in the book of life. after that get to know god. repent and trust in God. serve god, you will be rewarded.
My overthinking self would definitely get me killed in minutes!!
I rly wanna watch it now
In present everyone is sharing whatever they think on social media for everyone to know. Their thoughts are on display already.
finally a trailer that doesn't show the entire movie
I'm so excited holy shit
omg FINALLY
All the girls are dead and she’s only left? Couldn’t they put a hotter girl atleast lol.
How many times do they want to use the gun sound effect? Literally is even used at 2:11 for a projectile... bizarre...
Great Movie. Worst Trailer.
Poo Todd! Gotta poo!
"who are you?" Rey, Rey Mysterio
Reminds me of Children of Men

Considering Tom Holland's habit of giving spoilers He was a great choice for a character who can't keep a secret. Great Job😂
I have heard that when Tom Holland started this movie he was a teenager, they say he is agrand father now.
2021 is going to be great! Can't wait to see it
Good trailer. Probably best for streaming. Premise may not get followed through on, but I get the feeling they might've still made it an entertaining enough film.
Is the music stripped straight out of a cod lobby?
Nobody : Me : ok Tom Ok Daisy Ok Nick HOLY FUCK MADS
came for Tom , stayed for Mads
It's 2077 and still this movie is in post production along with cyberpunk 2077

Silly question but is the book called Chaos Walking or is it something else
Is this real? Or is this a trap tell me please
METHAPOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I don't know how I'll like hearing them talking at the same time as their thoughts are talking I hope it won't be like that in the whole film

Propaganda 👁👁👁⌚️
What a great book! And Tom Holland is starring in it!

Pretty sure this is based off the books. The books were so good. :)
Wow I can't wait for this movie to come out!!
Car Hop Trays available on Amazon stay safe!
Wow cool finally I will be able to see it and see the final product. I was an extra back in 2017 for that movie and I was curious to see how it look like when finished.  It was a wonderful experience to see the actors work and how it was made can’t wait to see it
People when Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley aren't gonna act exactly like Peter Parker and Rey in different movies: impossible
Auto Like and Comment with Whitelist option for Instagram and also other features. This app only costs $3.
That's a good movie when you're friendly man Spider-Man is in the neighborhood
After years now since covid. It might be even later
I don't really see an interesting plot
ah yes spiderman and rey the shitty protagonist the movie
well that's something new looking forward to it
Don’t kill the dog. Don’t kill the dog. Don’t kill the dog.
Yall really not gonna give my boy Mads a credit smdh

I really hope this movie turns things around for Daisy she's a really talented actress who got really screwed over by Star Wars.
So Rey went to Earth and encountered Peter Parker whose spider-sense is already malfunctioned.
I see Mads I watch
If there is horse ,there is Nick
Have a look at my this art channel❤️
KAUFMAN!
If the movie takes too long to be made. You can sure that it ain’t gonna be good

I feel misled. The title says it's about Kanye West.

Why does Daisy Ridley’s hair look like it was bought at Party City?
Yeah I wanna watch a movie that’s labeled as “new” that was filmed years ago. Pass

This book series by Patrick ness is one of my absolute favorites! Very nervous and excited about this.
PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK 'READ MORE')  There are some things that you should know:  1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:  Ro 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"  Ro 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"  It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.  2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:  Ro 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Ro 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."  Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.  3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).  Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.   Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.   Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.  Ro 10:9,10;13 "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:  ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I  am a sinner and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, I submit my will to yours, I place my Faith and Trust in You alone as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”  If you have truly placed your faith in Jesus Christ as your Lord, submitting your life to Him, you can know that you are a child of God and on your way to heaven.  Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism.
I will never be able to see Tom Holland as a man he will always look and act like a little child and I find that hilarious, theres probably kids who look up to this manlet
I love mads mikkelsen!
😶
Read the books if you haven't they are great. Book one: The Knife of Never Letting Go
Oh my gosh this looks insane.
This looks like a work of M. Night Shyamaladingdong.
Simp Walking
kuwgsdvhjsn klbgwg hheeeelll yeah
Is this a cross over episode
Good director, solid cast, interesting premise. I'm just gonna try to forget that this is based on YA fiction.
No one ever asks why they keep throwing "aliens"/demons in every horror movie now?  Its #ProjectBlueBeam
Crazy, in a 2-minute movie trailer, they spoil 90% of the plot.
Cheers to those who read the books! It's interesting how they portray the Noise here very different from how I envisioned it just being a bubble with words 😅.   AND THE BOAT SCENE!!! MANCHEE!!!   Definitely Excited!
At least they’re working on it lol
can anybody explain to me what’s going on
So Rey Palpatine meets Spiderman
This looks good
Not what expected but way better actually
In the description "A force that puts all men's thoughts on display." I smell agenda all over that sentence. I could be wrong, but I doubt it.
<<<<<< So Scary.. OMG
Does the....does the dog live?!
Holy crap the noise looks so sick! I was wondering how they’d do it and this was so much better than I could have imagined 😍
Tom Holland , Nick Jones !!!!!!!!!! Shut the front door !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
mads name should be before tom and godamn jonas
The cyberpunk 2077 of movies.
I need 10 more subs til my next giveaway
Tom: "Who... are you?"  Daisy: "I'm Rey. Rey Palpatine Solo Jettster Skywalker the Hut."
🔥
Let's be honest     Y'all came here because of the cast. Movie looks meh.
Badass
This trailer sucks due to the music. The snipets are uninformative. Acting though.
Whole new level of "You can't read woman's mind"
Straight to Netflix plz
So unrealistic... some dude sees a girl and tits aren't mentioned even once?! Disappointing...
This Little Tom dude appearing in almost every movie? 👌👌👌
YES! Finally something different other than a remake of a classic!
Lowkey thought it was CORPSE at the beginning yikes
Spiderman's thought bubbles cant shut up due to Rey's mind reading lol
It looks interesting! I’m excited to see Tom in more movies ☺️ P.S. Fellow readers and poetry lovers please check out my self-published poetry book: https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_p_kb_dp&asin=B08DM5WFJY&tag=kpembed-20&amazonDeviceType=A2CLFWBIMVSE9N&reshareId=2FQTPGK34G2E1HPHT09C&reshareChannel=system
I already feel like the dog is going to die in this one...
This looks interesting and no I haven't read the books you annoying pricks. I just want to watch a good movie. I'll let you lot know if I find a copy of these and read them.
0:31 Tom Holland’s stand!?
Joe Biden and his first wife, Neilia, had three children: Hunter, Beau and Naomi.  In 1972, Neilia and Naomi, died in a car accident. Joe eventually married a woman named Jill (his current wife).  He already knew her because she had been Hunter's babysitter at the time of the car accident. (Yeah, seems normal- marry the babysitter). They had a daughter named Ashley. Ashley lives 'a quiet life' and is frequently in and out of rehab for various substance abuse issues.  Now sadly, the sanest, most normal one of the 3 surviving kids, Beau, dies in 2015 from a brain tumor. He had been married to Haillie and they had 2 children, a boy and a girl named Natalie, who was 11 yrs old when her dad died.  Enter Hunter Biden, in 2015, to "comfort" his brother's widow. Mind you, Hunter is married at the time, to Kathleen Biden, since 1993. He starts screwing around with his dead brother's wife in 2015...his wife Kathleen finds out about it and they separate. Hunter moves in with his dead brother's wife, Haillie,and her two kids and they have a grand old time. He ultimately gets divorced from Kathleen in 2017. Meanwhile, he starts screwing around with a stripper,  while still shacking up with his dead brother's wife, before his divorce is finalized, and gets the stripper pregnant. Haillie kicks him to the curb supposedly for this indiscretion in 2018. He denies the stripper's baby is his, although a paternity test proves otherwise and eventually he marries a woman named Melissa in 2019 after knowing her for 6 days.  Does the tale end there? Why no, no it doesn't. That just sets the stage... Enter the laptop from hell loaded with emails, text messages, photos, child pornography,  videos, and other sordid digital images of drug use and rampant weirdness.  Hunter Biden dropped the laptop off in Delaware, his home state, to get it repaired. It seems he dropped it in some water while in a meth-induced state of mind. He then neglected to pick up the computer/pay the $85.00 repair fee and the laptop became the repair shop owner's property for non-payment. When the owner saw what was on it, he was so disturbed that he contacted the FBI.  No response!!! The DOJ? No response!!!!  Eventually, it landed in Rudy Giuliani's possession and he turned it over to the Delaware State Police AFTER making 4 copies of the hard drive. Turns out, there's quite a lot of child pornography on there...much of it involving children on Hunter's many trips to China. The Chinese Communist Party uses this as a blackmail tactic. They supply the young girls, they film you, unknowingly, and then they can keep you "in line", while paying you the big $$$ to do their bidding, like lucrative deals with your VP father.  Millions of dollars were paid to Hunter Biden for favors with the US Govt while Joe Biden was VP under Obama.  For 8 years Hunter made the contacts and split the money with his father, referred to as the "Big Guy" in all emails detailing how their ill gotten gains would be split up amongst all the criminals involved.  Joe Biden sold out his country and used his meth head son to do it. ...  But, IT GETS WORSE. Today, on the laptop, emails were released between Beau Biden's widow, Haillie, and Joe Biden in 2017 and more in 2018 when she and Hunter were still living together. They were casually talking about the continual "sexually inappropriate behavior" she had witnessed from Hunter toward her 14 year old daughter, Natalie, HIS NIECE!  She told Joe that she felt she had put her children in a dangerous situation by getting involved with Hunter Biden. Joe knew his son was screwing around with his niece and he advised his daughter-in-law to go to therapy. No one went to the police and the abuse escalated. THAT is the main reason she broke off her relationship with Hunter. Among the pictures of Hunter having sex with young Asian children, there were hundreds of provocative pictures of a 14 year old girl, mainly topless, and hundreds more of Hunter Biden, in sexual poses with her, HIS NIECE. She was 14 yrs old and HE WAS 48!!  BOTTOM LINE: ANY MAN WHO CAN'T TAKE CARE OF HIS OWN HOUSE, HAS NO BUSINESS BEING IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THE END.....but, is it?   Nope. Rudy says there is more to come, primarily involving Joe Biden getting rich off laundering foreign money through our country, using his son as intermediary. Biden is as dirty and crooked as they come. Hillary looks clean compared to him. Now it makes sense why Obama REFUSED to endorse him as the DNC candidate until he was the last man standing!  What a legacy they will leave behind! But the media is silent. Imagine the scandal this would be if it was Trumps family and sons....
Didn’t even recognize that was daisy Ridley
This actually looks so good, anybody know if I should read the book first
Ken from Street Fighter?

Can someone explain to my slow azz what’s going on
Now do another movie and reverse the genders. No? I didn't think so.
The 100 movie
Unrealistic,, there's no way these men haven't seen woman in years and their only thoughts aren't horny, right? With as much guys say they think about sex..
I feel alone in this thought, but I'm upset Tom Holland is Todd! Todd is turning 13 (yes, that's important to the plot) and Tom Holland is 25!
FINALLY!! Let’s pray this pandemic doesn’t stop us from watching this movie and have to wait 600 more years!!
i am confusion
i thought this movie got cancelled
Nice ❤️
I can’t believe they got the girl from Star Trek
Galen erso, rey and spiderman. Dang gurl
I loved these books so I have high hopes
For what i received i passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the scriptures  1 Corinthians 15 3   PS: "according to the Scriptures" - what the Apostle means is that Lord Jesus fulfilled prophecy's of the Prophets of God in Old Testament. There are like hundreds of Prophecies that Lord Jesus fulfilled, just look it up bruhs and gurls. God is our Father. He is the best of Fathers, the most lovable and merciful of fathers. Read the whole uncensored Bible that is Catholic(The Original) and  pray my friends. Wish you all well🙏amen🙏
I hope Daisy Ridley's character was well written, unlike the other stuff we don't mention. I have high hopes for this film!
YES THIS SERIES WAS SO GOOD OMGGGGGG i really hope they do a good job on this!!
This should go to Netflix
Tom Holland looks kind of like Josh Hutcherson in the thumbnail?
Wow this is really awesome fantasy world
Will Tom Holland ever play a character who is British just like him?
One of the movie trailer that give me just little things  about the story but make me wanna know everything! About it. I wanna read this book now. Love it! <3
how has there not been a single witty joke about his Spidey sense going through the roof in this movie
It’s cool and all, but it just feels like one of those movies they shove popular actors in for a quick buck
I'm curious how many people here have actually read the phenomenal books 😂
With the pandemic, this is the worst time for movies to release in theaters......  New Mutants & Chaos Walking: Hi🖐
Oh look! It's Rey and Galen Erso
Colossians 3:16✨ Let Wisdom dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing all wisdom, singing psalms ,hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God.   Go in peace and have a lovely day!✝️
This is an interesting visual depiction of what the NOISE is
If they kill the FUcKING dog i will lose my shit
I cannot take Mads seriously in this costume, it makes me think of Mexican restaurant music, when someone's having a birthday
I SCREAMED WHEN I SAW THIS BECAUSE FINALLY
shit movie omegalul
AH IM SO EXCITED! Daisy Ridley is like my favorite human ever 🥺
Feels much like the disaster ''After Earth'' staring Will Smith
Gayyyy
I genuinely thought this was a fan trailer omg was not expecting Tom and Daisy to come in and save 2020 like that
this looks like shit
I am the circle and the circle is me
this is my seventh time watching it in just 1 hour...
*IT'S ABOUT FLIPPIN TIME!* 🔥🔥🔥
This was filmed in 2017!?
You know it’s a good movie when your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man is in it
OHMYGOD OHMYGOD OHMYGOD THIS IS GONNA BE AMAZING OSHEOWHEJEE
Plz be good.
My name is Rey, Rey Skywalker.
Are we finally going to see this then?
I can only see that guy as Hannibal Lecter
OMG, just a few days ago I was wondering why these book series were never adapted for a big screen, and what do you know, here it is.
A blockbuster movie about schizophrenia.
A generic young adult novel film with a weird mist of memories around the character's head
Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)::;;!
Daisey ridley as a blonde is not a good look
Life goes on
Where’s jaden smith??
"It was terrible crash!". Why we speak about last Star Wars?
Could have a World War Z on our hands here. The amount of heavy reshoots actually made the movie a lot better 🍿🥤
Two words: can't wait. Tom Holland is like the new Lon Chaney sr. He would've made a nice Peeta in Hunger Games. Here's to 2021
his accent is so bad lmaooo
No lo se ricks... 〒_〒
The trailer is bad, i dno too many cuts
Never seen a girl before ? How are you not extinct
I'm so scared this is gonna suck because The Knife of Never Letting Go was the coolest book I ever read as a kid...also I'm a little salty they didn't go with that AWESOME title and mainstreamed the crap out of this adaptation
Yo me voy a morir DESPUÉS DE 3 AÑOS ALFIN ❤️
No wonder women went extinct after hearing men’s thoughts they would literally go insane it wouldn’t be fun to “I wonder what he’s thinking about”
This guys are going to be Peter Parker and Rey forever
Group of guys with their thoughts on display, first girl seen in years, I feel like this trailer must be leaving out some of the thoughts they're having.
i read the books years ago bc i heard this movie was coming out and i have been waiting like 3 years for this omggg
Something else for you. If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.   God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16   God is warning the world. End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, plagues, violence, scoffers, government control, earthquakes, fires, floods, people will be lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, evil will be called good and good called evil, sexual immorality rampant adultery, fornication, abuse... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in child sacrifice (abortion), World leaders are prepping for a One-World order, government, religion (please don’t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there's only one alternative) The government is also prepping to have you believe that UFO's are real... Soon the antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many... then the tribulation will start, life on earth will be horrific. Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it's too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, he loves you, open your heart take a chance receive Jesus as your savior.

Rebel Wilson looks good after all that weightloss
The movie better open with the dog asking to poop just like the book
Spiderman and starwars crossover ahahahah
Finally!!!! Let's fuckin go!!!!
I heard the production of this movie was even more entertaining. From actors quitting mid shoot, to scrips being rewritten the night before, to producers shutting down the entire production many times. I'm surprised the movie was ever made. Even more surprised it looks somewhat good. This could just be the ad department doing a stellar job at polishing turds.
Someone needs to teach these fools how to play pazaak in their mind
https://youtu.be/m6eYVPFTgSk
this looks S O AMAZING OMFGGGGG I'M SCREAMING HABDBSNSNAS
"Forget everything you know".... Okay! ... Some guy asking me five years later: "Did you watch that movie?" Me not responding because not only have I forgotten about this movie, but also don't know what a movies is, and on top I have forgotten how to talk.
The peter tingle evolution
If this dog get killed, the movie is over.
Al finnn
Hopefully it’s not as bad as Star Wars
Visual spidersense.
There's no woman, but show a cutscene where there are woman......makes sense
Boring
FINALLY!!
Finally! I read the books in 10 or 11th grade when I learned there was gonna be a movie for it and I love the books and I’m so glad the movie is finally coming soon! 🙌👏🙏
If anything, it looks interesting. It's also a Star Wars/Marvel Cinematic Universe reunion/mash-up. It's like a cinematic mix tape.
WOOOOOO WO WO WOOOOOOO THATS MY MUSBAND YALL WOOOOOOO
Hell yeah,  Mads Mikkelsen
Solo la veré para ver a Mads Mikkelsen 😍😍😍😍😍
THE CAST DOE
I’m happy this is actually happening
X: The Last Woman
I tried reading the book once. The whole Noise thing made everything so confusing. I had no idea what was going on. I feel like the movie might be easier to follow. Also, I just want to say something to fans of the books: Remember, this movie is only based on _The Knife of Never Letting Go._ If you want movie versions of _The Ask and the Answer_ and _Monsters of Men,_ then this one has to be successful. I've seen a lot of YA novel adaptations fail before they could become a series. 😔
What is the name of the book this based on? because I’d want to read that before I watch this
I just clicked the thumbnail and immediately the video is screaming at me.
How'd they not include Mads in the title?
I just watched this muted and it already looks good. Should I read the book/books first tho?
Hell yeah, this book series is incredible. And the film looks promising.
Why the low views ?
I swear tom holland is on a mission to be in every single movie
All we need is a release date!
When Star-Wars meets Spider-man !
What is this movie about
This looks like a mess!
Hannibal be looking like a P.I.M.P!
0:30 when a discord admin hears a girl in the voice channel
I know FOR SURE what my noise would be saying if I was around Daisy Ridley ;)    ..   "REY IS AN OVER POWERED MARY SUE AND EVERYBODY HATES HER"
BB
Wait wtf is 2:13?
Looks good.
Wow this movie looks awesome.Wow it’s weird seeing Daisy Ridley with blond hair
Am I the only one who felt the trailer glitches irritating ? 😅
dafuq did i just see? .... i need to watch this movie so bad
What Women Want 2
Daisy ridley still acts like a plank board. :XD
I was 17 when they started filming and now I’m 20😐
I admire the talent infront of and behind the camera but from this trailer alone, the rumors might be true. Who knows?
I'd be fucked if ppl could see my thoughts
THIS LOOKS AWESOME!
Peter Parker with spider sense on steroids trying to save Rey from Nick Jonas who's the son of the mayor, Hannibal Lecter. Awesome
Is this the knife of never letting go??
Interesting idea, but I don’t get the plot of this movie
when you dont understand anything in the trailer only then you know its gonna be good
Put mas Mickelson film, not  daisy Ridley , 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
After yeaaars of waiting IM SO EXCITED
So my mom was listening to me watch this, and cared to point out that she didn’t say that she wouldn’t hit him with a rock😂
Doug Liman : - When are you going to finally release my f******** movie ?  Lionsgate : - Yes.
There is a lot of difference already noticeable in this trailer from the books. But I mean, I’m excited and I cannot wait for it!
The trailer seems intriguing but any movie that emerges after production hell tends to be a bit of a mess
This looks SUPER awesome, so you know I'm gonna have to read the series before the movie comes out.
I CANT WAIT AHAHAHHA
Uhmmmmmm.... YASSSSSSSS
I am SO ready
Me: Orders Leeloo on Wish. Wish: Sends Daisy Ridley with bad hair cut/dye job and orange suspenders.
IT LOOKS SO GOOD
FINALLY! YESSS
oh no what has spiderman gotten himself into now?
Its been a while dont ya think
The movie sucks so bad they're gonna release it during Covid so no one remembers it.
Everyone's talking about spoilers and I'm pissed how they cheated us Uncharted fans with using a still from this movie
should have stayed buried
ugh, let me add another book to tbr then
1:45 I love how the remixed the dog's barks in the music XD  1:30 and 2:20 well those were scary!
This thing took longer to release than 10 Nevada elections
This move finished over a year and a half ago......
God that was simply awful.
If the dog dies I’m giving this a zero I don’t care if it’s in the book
Every man’s worst nightmare.
YEEESSSSSSS
k
I don’t care if the movie is bad or good...the dog better not die.
Chaos walking more like chaos the movie
Aye!!!  The star studded cast in this movie is unparalleled, Mads Mikkelsen and Daisy Ridley have experience from Star Wars, it’s dope as hell, and the entire trailer is giving me hunger game vibes.
Oh wow the movie looks really good ..too bad Nick Jonas’s bad acting kinda taints it, but besides that it looks great. Ya get top tier A list spectacular performers like Ridley, Holland, & Mads ..but spoil it with a lousy Craig’s list casting call amateur like Nick Jonas? I don’t get it
From The Director of "The Bourne Identity" and "Edge of Tomorrow"😳😳😳😳😳😳 TAKE MY MONEY!!!!!!
❤❤❤awesome❤❤❤
Wait this movies actually happening now?? I HAVENT READ THE BOOK YET
Everyone read the books before watching the movie. They are unbelievably good.
THE DOG THE DOG THE DOG NOOO MANCHEEE WHAT
Marvel x Star Wars x Hunger Games...I LOVE IT
Peter Parker and Rey ❤️
Prentisstown looks EXACTLY how I imagined it
I’m getting the 100 vibe from this
i just watched the whole movie
Chaos walking, starring tom holland and a plank of wood.
Of course this trailer comes out on International Men's Day.
It's Ok. Rey will save everyone co shes the bestest evar!!!!
THE BEST BOOK SERIES. THIS BETTER BE GOOD. TRAILER LOOKS PROMISING.
Finally! I was wondering how they would show the noise and I like it. I am not totally sold on who is playing the main two characters (Todd & Viola), but hopefully that changes after I see the movie
This move has been described as literally unwatchable. Challenge accepted.
FIIIIIIINAAAALLLLYYYYYYY
This looks so God damn 👍 good. Can't wait to watch it. I will be reading the book first though
Sounds a lot like maze runner
FINALLY
Spackle!!!
I am waiting this movie
Blockbuster movie
The way I’m proud as fuck
wait if you've never seen a girl before then how do you know what a girl is ?
Flop in the making
Daisy Ridley looks so much like Gal Gadot in the *thumbnail* .
How is mads mikkelsen not credited but nick jonas is
This planet would be a nightmare for people who overthink.
Yay cant wait to see a new movie with Rey Skywalker
The group gets surrounded, they're all doomed. Tom pull on his Spider-Man mask while Daisy pulls out a gold light saber. Shit gets real.
Book 1: great  Book 2: incredible Book 3: shit
Damn he straight up tackled that alien (or monster I'm not sure) and punched it in its face lmao  Edit: Stabbed it in its throat actually lol
As a huge fan of the books and someone who has read the series three times, this trailer didn’t really do it for me. I’m excited for the movie but my expectations have been lowered
WOW
Sausage Fest: The Movie
" I like your dog" 😂😂😂... So excited for this movie
There’s no way this movie is actually coming out.
*"Men don't undertand Women" the movie*
Who are his fathers here?
It took so much years I already forgot the story 😭
I can't wait! #ChaosWalking
WHAT IS THIS THE KNIFe OF NEVER LETTING GO????
Please dubb in hindi also
0:39 I'm Rey Rey Skywalker
They FINALLY are releasing this!! I thought it would never be done
coming soon =  in 2 years because no cinema is open.
i do not like Daisy Ridley but i like Tom Holland!!!!
Any mads mikkelsen fans here 💓
“ who are you?” “ Rey Skywalker” “ oh so we’re using our made up names, well I am Spider-Man”
Imagine if the aliens from "A quiet place" were there too 😂😂
This actually looks good!
Cant wait to see this dumpster fire.
I'VE BEEN WAITIN FOR THIS MOMENT! TURN IT UP 🔊
I never read the book but this trailer makes me want to read it now!
Yes ! Finally! After years of waiting it's finally coming out
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 can't wait
They're supposed to be 14...........
WOW, looks like I found a book to read. Looks amazing.
Interesting 🤔 I will se it
What's the music please ?
Isn't it convenient for the future women.  Your man can never cheat without you knowing lol
Spiderman, a kid stuck in Jumanji, a Jedi, and the creator of the Death Star.   What exactly is the plot of this movie again?
The most awaited movie      For me 😍 . I've been waiting for this movie since last 2 years .
Not 100% impressed by the trailer... but it has Mads Mikkelsen in it which is enough for me.
Tom can't keep secrets...finally a role where he can be himself
Les van arruinar la carrera se ve chafisima 👎👎
“Do you believe there’s hope at the end?” I ask.  “No,” she says simply, looking away. “No, I don’t, but I’m still going.” She eyes me, “You coming with?”  I don’t have to answer.  We go on running
Why are there no comments about NICK JONAS!!!😂😂
I don’t know why but this looks like a rip-off of The Maze Runner!!!
yo can they please stop it with that WAAAAAH noise in every trailer.
watching the trailer made me forget about the chaos that happened in this year
I completely forgot this movie exist lol
I cant wait to see Tom Holland age throughout different scenes due to the production HELL this just left
Looks interesting, when I first heard about this, I was under the impression that one of my favorite directors, Robert Zemeckis was gonna produce under his studio ImageMovers but now I'm not seeing his name anywhere either it was a mistake or he bailed after so much delays. I'm a little disappointed but I've already read the book and we got the director of Swingers and the trailer looks good, so I'll give the movie a shot, Robert Zemeckis or no Robert Zemeckis.
I can see why they called this unreleasable lmao.
Finally the trailer is here! I've been wating so much!
Why is Tom character a "SIMP"?
reverse kam??
IM SCREAMING
This......was a little bit chaotic. Never red the books so for me this is just a story of, horny men fighting over the last woman on earth. Not really interesting or unique. Hope there is way more to it.
BEEN WAITING 3 YEARS FOR THIS PURRRR
Oh, so that’s what happened to Rey.
Bro, I saw the leaked trailer on Twitter.
The return of Rey 🤦🏻‍♂️
It's a movie adaptation of a book, it ain't gonna be good lol.
Looks incredible, Can't wait to see it!
I LOVE TOM HOLLAND AND DAISY RIDLEY LIKE HONESTLY SO EXCITED
Witness Charlie Kaufman’s contribution @ 1:17 😂
The movie have been in production since 2017? Lol
how many r bored at home
Tom Holland is look so nice
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Is it real? #thecookingappetite
this looks hella intresting
Spiderman and Rey 🤣
I’m pretty sure Tom Holland is in charge of creating trailers these days.
Oh finally I thought this film was gonna be scrapped or something
Istg if anything happens to Manchee in this film I will not be watching it
Daisy Ridley ❤😍❤😍❤😍
You already know who I'm talking about when I say she deserves better than Star Wars 😛😛
Damn Daisy ❤❤
Love Daisy Ridley... Good to see her here
I really like Daisy Ridley... She deserves so much better
OMG❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Where did they spend the budget?
This literally looks like live action movie of cartoon *Blue dragon*
The trailer is not bad for a movie that was supposedly an unreleasable disaster based on test screenings.
Tom, mads and nick are gonna rock in this. Waiting to watch it for them.
OMG I got goose bumps
2:16 my spider senses are tingling
peter:hey have you seen this really old movie Empire Strikes Back? also peter being with rey:
Is this the whole trilogy as a movie or just the first book? And if so why is it just called Chaos Walking and not Knife of never letting go ?
Tom holland and Nick jonas the crossover we didn't expect but we definitely want
omg i need to see it in the theater
Love Tom Holland :) I think i'll give it a try.  I just hope I won't get any headaches with all the thoughts popping up and everything ^^ Seems a bit messy lol
2: chaos jogging 3: chaos running 4: chaos sprinting Prequel: chaos knee walking Prequel 0: chaos standing Prequel -1: chaos sitting Prequel -2: chaos laying
Damn, love the books but this does not look good
Omg it looks incredible I can’t deal!!!!!
Lionsgate Movie Universe 狮门电影宇宙
Looks ripe for new memes
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE I CAN FIND IT NOW AND ONLINE ??
They wrote Nick Jonas name in the Title and not Mads. Heck!!
We Did It! Stockton is for her people again! Please god no more bay area bull Again!🙏 🎊🎸🥳👍🎊 #stockton #teamlincoln #allinforstockton https://youtu.be/KTDw7fnBCic https://youtu.be/tHe6ar-X2cQ
The trailer i've been waiting for a long time!!
If he never seen a girl how would he know she a girl.
People when Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley aren't gonna act exactly like Peter Parker and Rey in different movies: *impossible*
Mix bag of Passengers and After Earth  Tom Holland is the new dwayne johnson..
Amazing trailer
So this is the allegedly unwatchable movie? Looks very watchable to me, I'm stoked. ^^
It's Mads Mikkelsen in a fur coat for me. Also, Nick Jonas just keeps teaming up with MCU actors, I love it!
Mads Mikkelsen's name should've been there
Tom 😍😍holland
daisy y tom solo se llevan 4 años de edad pero tio se ve taaaaan claro lo muchisimo q se llevan fisicamente q me incomoda bastante todo
I hope this movie's good because Patrick Ness' books are brilliant. It's coming out January 2021 so plenty time to reread the series before I see it.
oh shit i honestly didn't expected to be like this, definitely worth the wait and re read the whole series
well damn
"You might dont like my dog." -Tom Holland a man with priorities~
im here all for Tom and dude is absolutely gonna kill it in this movie... but can we take a second to give some love for mr Jonas Brother over here! cuz man he looks good as a bad guy! im so so so excited to see this finally coming out after 3 years of them testing it and remaking it!! So proud of Tom stepping out of the 'spiderman' alter to do much more action and daring roles!!!
Come on, Doug Liman, channel all your badassery into this film and make it great 🙏
I think it’s coming out in January!!  Edit- January 22nd I’m so excited!!! ahhh we have been waiting for years! I gotta reread the books a third time
Plz release in Hindi language also
Spider Sense, its that your voice.... 😅
This better not be as bad as Artemis Fowl even tho the trailer looked pretty good
So...Viola is an alien?
That's a great trailer🔥
finally, a trailer that doesn't spoil the story it's so rare
Alguien aquí habla español y ama a tom Holland xd
Well its been a LONG time coming but it looks great! Glad they've done such an iconic series a little bit of justice.
Let me guess, there’s gonna be a scene where Tom’s character has a sexual thought, that scares Daisy’s character off
hunger games vibe 😍😍😍
wow
Me: Oh my gosh this movie is finally coming out At the end of the trailer: Coming Soon Me: sigh
It actually looks... Good?? Wtf? Ok lionsgate. Please don't fuck this one up. You've got a potential big winner here
"I'm Peter by the way" "Rey Skywalker" "Oh you're using your made-up names then I'm spider-man"
Peter Parker & Ray Skywalker ✨✨
This looks like some awful CW Schlocky Sci-Fi.
Meh I heard it was unwatchable so imma skip this one
i can't wait to watch it
So a hot girl crashed on a world full of men and those men haven’t seen a girl in years and you can hear all the men’s thoughts......
Oh boy !! she can't act !! her acting is terrible.
Tom is perfect for the role. In reality, he can't shut up about the movie roles that he's a part of without (accidentally) giving out spoilers.
YESSSSSS THIS LOOKS SO GOOD!!!!!  *soft tear * i have much hope for this
Guess they are in the search for a new young adult novel they could bank off of
Omfg I can't waitttt
To think this was filmed a few years ago
crappiest trailer.. looks like After Earth  reboot
They sold me with directed by Doug Liman.
Looks like a bag of shit from a mile away 😂🤣🤦‍♂️
Awesome
I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!
I waited so damm long
Oh no! There is a dog...
Stranger Things is a classic but what would happen if I dressed up as Robotman and went to a Stranger Things convention and scream at the top of my lungs "DOOM PATROL IS STRANGER AND BETTER!!!"
Looks like an 2018 movie.... Direct to Netflix!
love Tom Holland ! Period
♥️👄♥️👌
Guy says all women ( minus the main girl ) are dead...  Ending of trailer shows a lot of armed people ( there are 2 other women included ).
Im going to say it..... it’s doesn’t look bad it looks okay
💘
1:35 Pewdiepie to any minecraft animals
After all the delays and gossip from behind the scenes, I expected this to look awful. But, I actually think it looks kinda great? Haven't read the book or anything tho so not sure what it is/isn't meant to be like
Man goes to doctor, says he's depressed; life seems harsh, and cruel; says he feels all alone in threatening world. Doctor says "treatment is simple, the great clown - Pagliacci - is in town; go see him, that should pick you up." Man bursts into tears, "but doctor..." he says "I am Pagliacci."
Like BRAD PITT, TOM CRUISE and KEANU REEVES Tom Holland gone be rule out Hollywood very soon..in future.....🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😎😎😎😎❤️❤️❤️❤️
imagine if ant man shrinks, crawls into someone's ding a ling, and then blasts back into full size
Sony: The MCU has become a success, so I'm gonna reboot Spider-man and do the origin story all over again.  Me: There's no need for a reboot and it's pointless to do the origin story again, Spider-man deserves to be with other marvel characters; you just wanna hold on to the film rights.   Sony: I'm altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.  Me: This deal is getting worse.  Sony: The Amazing Spider-man has failed, I'm letting Spider-man join The MCU but I still own him.  Me: That's not fair, you should fully give Spider-man back to Marvel; Marvel does it for the fans, you only do it for the money.  Sony: I'm altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.  Me: This deal is getting worse.  Sony: Furthermore,  I'm changing Mary Jane's name, making Aunt May young, making J Johan Jameson bald, turning The Daily Bugle into a news website, and only give slight hints of Uncle Ben and barley mention him; just so people would think that I do a better job with Spider-man.  Me: But that's too much changes and that's exactly why most people are siding with you.  Sony: I'm altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.  Me: This deal is getting worse.  Sony: I'm leaving The Spectacular Spider-man and Spider-man: The New Animated Series canceled and start a new Spider-man cartoon on Disney XD that is lazy retelling of his origins.  Me: But Spectacular and New Animated Series were great shows, they should be brought back; you leave most Spider-men on a cliff hanger.  Sony: I'm altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.  Me: This deal is getting worse.  Sony: I'm starting my own cinematic universe called The SPUMC, it will be soulless and cheap and will feature awesome characters like Venom, Morbius, Carnage, Kraven, Black Cat, and Silver Sable and I will trick people into thinking that this is The MCU.  Me: Are you fucking kidding me?! there's no need for another universe and your just wasting characters.  Sony: I'm altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.  Me: This deal is getting worse.  Sony: I'm giving my SPUMC characters rap songs.  Me: The hell? those characters don't deserve rap songs, MCU does a great job deciding what songs and music to give to there characters; you only want to keep up what's popular today.  Sony: I'm altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.  Me: This deal is getting worse.  Sony: I'm getting the perfect cast for my SPUMC characters and make them look awesome and very likeable which is the only thing we'll work hard on.  Me: Seeing J K Simmons return as J Johan Jameson was a great surprise but it would be a million to one shot for The MCU to let the perfect cast from The SPUMC reprise their roles, and they are gonna have to make changes to them just because you wasted all the good stuff.  Sony: I'm altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.  Me: This deal is getting worse.  Sony: Venom is a poorly written cash and grab with very slow pacing and venom has very little screen time and my plan to trick people that this is a MCU film worked, it's now one of the highest grossing films of 2018.  Me: Venom deserved so much more than being stuck with you cunts! That pacing is way too slow, even for a start of a film series; the first Iron Man had slow pacing, little screen time for the Iron Man suit, and had very little action but it was interesting and it's does a great job stating that Iron Man was only the beginning. Damn it, Venom's 2 years old and I still want my $12.50 back.  Sony: I'm altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.  Me: This deal is getting worse.  Sony: The only symbiote from the five spawned from Venom will be Riot and we'll make him the team leader and make him way stronger than Venom.  Me: Riot is no where that as strong in the comics and he's way too obscure to have such a big role like that without the other four symbiotes.  Sony: I'm altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.  Me: This deal is getting worse.  Sony: Here is a Spider-man game and a Spider-man DLC for the new Avengers game and both of them are only available for The Play Station which I own.  Me: That's bullshit, I'm not buying an entire Play Station just to play as Spider-man!  Sony: I'm altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.  Me: This deal is getting worse.  Sony: I am now starting an animated Spider-man film series with good writers and ground breaking animation just in case if The SPUMC fails.  Me: I can't believe this shit, your doing too much with Spider-man just to hold on to the rights in a desperate attempt; and it shows.  Sony: I'm altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.  Me: This deal is getting worse.  Sony: Sandman does not exist in The MCU, I'm making him part of Mysterio's illusions.  Me: Sandman is one of the best Spider-man villians, that's insulting him!  Sony: I'm altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.  Me: This deal is getting worse.  Sony: Disney just asked for 50% of Far From Home's box office, I was planing on removing Spider-man from The MCU for no reason but now they gave me one; I taking him away for one month and be the hero by giving him back.  Me: That's pretty much stealing someone's bike and pretending to be a nice person by giving it back, your only gonna make yourself look like a douche.   Sony: I'm altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.  Me: This deal is getting worse.  Sony: I'm sending Tom Holland to D23 to say he's ok for what happened.  Me: The boy is basically your sex slave, he's gargling your mayonnaise!  Sony: I'm altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.  Me: This deal is getting worse.  Sony: I'm turning The SPUMC into an adjunct of The MCU, The MCU affects The SPUMC but The SPUMC can't affect The MCU; it will feature the exact same characters with the exact actors from The MCU including Spider-man and Vulture.  Me: You are being an asshole, this is gonna turn The MCU into a complete mess and confuse everyone!  Sony: I'm altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.  Me: This deal is getting worse.  Sony: I'm getting Tom Rothman to do my Spider-man movies, with him we can surely top the MCU.  Me: The same idiot who ruined X-men and Fantastic Four? You are trying to piss us off!  Sony: I'm altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.  Me: This deal is getting worse.  Sony: I'm making a Mysterio and Madam Web solo films in The SPUMC.  Me: The fuck? they never had a single issue of their own, how is that shit even gonna work?!  Sony: I'm altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.  Me: This deal is getting worse.  Sony: No Spider-man films on Disney+.  Me: That's not fair, they have all of the other MCU films; even the Fox movies, you know if you keep this shit up then Disney might buy you too.  Sony: I'm altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.  Me: This deal is getting worse.  Sony: Todd McFarlane expressed interest to do a Venom and Spawn crossover on the big screen, I might even greenlit it.  Me: That's something that should only be done as a comic book or a fan film, they might have been made from the same creator but they are from separate universes; it's just gonna make things an even bigger mess.  Sony: I'm altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.  Me: This deal is getting worse.  Sony: The Sinister Six will not be part of The MCU and will only appear in The SPUMC.  Me: I'm gonna fucking kill you shithead, The Sinister Six is important for Spider-man!  Sony: I'm altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.  Me: This deal is getting worse.  Sony: I just announced a Spider-woman film but will not say if it's part of The MCU or The SPUMC just to trick people  Me: You're just torturing the people and trying to trick them into thinking that it's the MCU but it's actually the SPUMC.  Sony: I'm altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.  Me: This deal is getting worse.  Sony: I'm teaming up with Amazon to do my SPUMC shows on their streaming service.  Me: You actually got Amazon to join your side?!   Sony: I'm altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.  Me: This deal is getting worse.  Sony: I'm bringing back Jamie Foxx as Electro for Spider-man 3.  Me: Blue Electro sucks, we need his classic look back; and he's from the failed Amazing Spider-man, what makes you think that would be a great idea to bring him back?  Sony: I'm altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.  Me: This deal is getting worse.  Sony: I'm changing Spider-man's design in the Play Station 5 remastered to make him look like Tom Holland.  Me: That's literally the polar opposite of changing Movie Sonic's design.  Sony: I'm altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.  Me: This deal... is very fair, I'm glad to be part of it.
Yea it’s gonna be garbage
it looks great. i'll start reading the books today.
Looooove this can't WAIT!!!!
3 Words: OH MY GOD
Planet of the Simps
Tom Holland saying he's never seen a girl before is the most WTF moment of this trailer
So excited to see this clusterfuck of a project finally get made. It's been delayed for so long now and it's got so much going against it that I'm just waiting to see finally see it however bad it is. My only hope is that it's not boring, please god let it be at least entertaining. Let it be the dumbest shit ever please.
yassssssss
Spider-Man teams up with Rey Skywalker
God this better be good
Living in 2020 be like: *Chaos Walking*
VOD release, calling it now.
SO EXCITED THIS MOVIE IS FINALLY COMING OUT!!!! I'm ready for a Dystopian Young Adult Renaissance. Also Tom and Daisy together!!!!
Thank god, it's a Sci Fi movie and not a real thing, or else my thoughts would have sent me to jail long back 😅
😍 TOM HOLLAND!!!!
its finally happening after 3,000 years in production!
We'll see..great cast though for sure
With all due respect... what the fuck was that trailer? 😐
Chaos Walking looks fine but it could be a hot mess.
Would have loved to watch the trailer, but unfortunately I immediately stop watching a trailer when it begins with those obnoxious 5-second teaser-trailers. I mean, that's the reason I clicked on it, why would I need a teaser for the trailer I'm about to see?
This movie is literally The 100 show bundled all together.
Meh.. looks stupid
Spider-man and Rey Skywalker
wow this looks rlly bad, very excited!!!
to anyone who’s asking: the movie was only delayed once because they needed reshoots (normal for a movie making) because Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley were busy with Star Wars and Marvel stuff so that’s why the movie is only coming out in 2021 :)
I was really excited when I saw the Charlie Kaufman was writing but apparently he only wrote the first draft and left so I'm not keeping my hopes up but I'll still check it out since it looks interesting
I'm ready 😁😍🤩
One eternity later...
😻😻😻😻 al fin!!!!
Those effects & certain shots remind me of Annihilation but this does look good
I've always been a fan of Doug liman use of sounds in movies and this sounds awesome
