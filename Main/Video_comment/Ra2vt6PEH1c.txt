What was that
Dayot Upamecano is French version of Harry Maguire 😂🤣
Bayern-RB Leipzig All Goals 0:07 Eric Choupo-Moting (Bayern) 0:18 Marcel Halstenberg (RB Leipzig)
Venham buscar os três jogadores do Palmeiras Estevão, Kevin e Giovanni
Lol upamecano just yellow 🤣🤣
Referees and Bayern. A true love story..🤬🤬
Yellow card? 😯
0:05 this line reminds me of haaland goal vs lipzik in 2020
German football is finished after losing against Japan in 2022 world cup...🤬
I love watching Kimmich🥺🥺
0:14 Foul
Einmal Leipzig Immer Leipzig🔴⚪
That was a red
Brilliant comeback!
Germany 🇩🇪
neuer is really irreplacable
I think, technically, Sadio Mané misses a lot at Bayern Munich. His generosity and leadership in the organization of the game was a great contribution at Bayern before his injury. Moreover, that's why his absence is very much felt currently at Liverpool (my former club). I hope he will come back very soon to join the Bayern Munich team (my new club). Good luck BAYERN.

What ? We all know that upamecano is weak, but that was clearly red card
i see.. i think its red card... by the way... ref. hahaha
Klare Rot. Naja war halt ein Bayern Spieler…
Wow no red card....I guess because of Bayern Munich
Tired of Bayern getting a pass or help from officials cause they're the gold child. That was a clear red card.
Referees always helping boring Munich
Bad refereeing.
At 0:28 Upamecano is clearly the last man. The officials need to do better. Pathetic!
There will come a time when that will just be an automatic red no matter what. Deliberate cheating to gain an advantage must be punished more harshly , otherwise players will continue to “take a yellow” with glee.
the nuttmeg at 0:25 nice one szobo
Why dont you show the shot against the post from Gnabry or the goal from Goretzka that was not given because of a shoulder length of offside? There were better highlights than the ones you have chosen to cut in this video...
Bayern Munchen are broken without Robert Lewandowski ⚽
Fun game to watch, but sad performance from Bayern. The goals were though
Encore une erreur d arbitrage qui tue le match. Honteux comme d'habitude dans le football.
Bayern Munich always get the help from ref
Upamecano is one of the most overrated defenders today! Plays for Bayern first team just because he is french.
Crime in German football has begun.
Kimmich goretzka double pivot midfield is so overrated
Goood
Szoboszlai Best Assist Player Bundesliga.
Couldn’t do more to save that goal, the defence was responsible for that. Pretty solid performance for Sommer and it was only his 2nd day in the club!
Football is so rigged nowadays boooo
Bayer ellen nem illik pirosat adni. Főleg úgy, hogy egy magyar ellen szabálytalankodott .....!
For those that say it’s a red card learn the game first. There is a man right next to the defender so he’s not the last man. If the other defender was further away from the ball it’s a red card and a clear cut chance.
Incredible match
Stop at  0:28, you can clearly see that Upamecano is the last man. Wrong decision, why do they even have VAR if they don't use it.
Upamecano red card non negotiable  This  is totally unacceptable by me
Red card Hmmmmm I doubt. Definitely the yellow card was supposed to be given to Opa
highlights should be 3-4 minutes long.
Leipzig were lucky to come away with a point this game. Olmo kept spamming shots outside the box as if an outfield player was in goals; Schlager kept loosing the ball unprovoked. The forwards were stagnant. Szoboszlai was lazy
Leipzieg makin ngeri ajaa
Great start back to bundesliga
Yann sommer showed his quality especially given that he only had one training session prior to the game, some inaccurate passes occurred but I believe that he'll do a lot better as time goes by, at least he was reliable enough
Bayern own the league 🤣
Permainan terbaik
defence lacks because there is no manuel neuer
Missing Lewandowski
And who sat 90 min on the bench??? Blind. And all these so called ajax lovers are wrong. Schreuder-blind   1-0. With ajax on the bench. With bayern on the bench.
Stop the video! At the foul, De Ligt is 2 meters behind Szobo! So it's clearly a red card.
บาเยินเล่นเหมือนไม่อยากชนะ
VAR is good but hasnt prevented big teams to be pushed. If this foul was commited by smaller team VAR would turn on 100% and ref would change his yellow to a red. De Light was 2 meters behind Soboslai when he was tackled down. Dissgrace this wasnt overruled to a red by VAR. Pure dissgrace
Upmecano  read car last man what decition
Хорошая игра
0:26 lmao
i dont really watch bundesliga, but this one was li!
Upa should get a red. Szobo <3
As a Bayern fan Upamecano faul was a red card but not problem 1-1
VARyern Munchen 🤡
Really opmecano has a red car
00:06 Sane celebrating even before the ball crossed hahaa
You guys GOTTA make longer highlights like c'mon 1 min is a joke
im so glad the bundesliga is back
Bayern Muenchen league
Just like that the highlight is?
Upamecano is the worst player at bayern münchen!
Pero ya es adiós a Never?
damn Bayernliga. other teams would hv received a red card.
Love to see Bayern struggling. 🤩
😂😂😂
Szoboszlai is one of truly wonderful player and Leipzig is better team in 2nd half and should have won if they are clinical and I hope Freiburg wins against Wolfsburg to close the gap in the title race after Bayern's draw against Leipzig
(Sigh) We’re so lucky that the referee is tolerant. Otherwise RB Leipzig could’ve beaten us. Careful when tackling, Upamecano. Not all referees are tolerant as this one.
vaya roja que le perdonaron a upamecano
any team other than bayern, thats a red
Договоняк обоссанный
when will extended highlights come??
My prediction both is true. fair
Guys,hey, we gonna lose the game against Psg.We shouldnt play 3 defenders, look how players are packed in the center and getting dribbled on the wings
Vamos Bayern Munich
Daniel Siebert should have to show a red card to Dayo, he was the last man and he clearly prevented the goal scoring opportunity. Upamecano was so so lucky
DFB is so SOLD out. They suck Bayerns balls
Bayern as usual get help from DFB. Disgusting.
Bayern fan but upa red😂
How was that not a red???
The referee was biased towards Bayern. It was a red card
0-1 Moting 1-1 Halstenberg
For those who telling Upamecano is not the last man: pause the vid when he's tackling. Clearly he was, and was also preventing the 1-on-1 situation with the keeper, which should have been given a red card.
Really Great players ilove you all
Great highlights. Wondering who you are paying to put these together but definitely not a surprise that we are miles behind the premier league if you have people with obviously no football knowledge pulling together these highlights.
90 minutes match from two of the best teams in the Bundesliga and you get a massive 0.59 seconds 'highlights'. How is that promoting the Bundesliga & Fußball?  You could be more generous and increase the highlights by 100% to 118 seconds, or better still to 3 minutes. Give the fans and followers of the sport something. 59 seconds is pathetic.
Нарезка не полноценная,Бавария не справедливо проиграла.
What was wrong with goretzka earlier goal,,?
Bundesliga is back 😊
Guess that until 0:23 the filming took place with a potatoe.
No red card? 🤨
Come On Bayern 🤍❤️ 😊🙌🏼👏🏼
Insane decision. Should have absolutely been a red card
Vergonzoso...si siguen así de mal no quiero ni pensar la paliza que "nos" va a pegar el Borusia y otros equipos grandes...😑😠😕
Awful awful decision from the ref
Nah tht foul.. something wrong about tbt reff..
Where is neur?
Freiburg rn: *readying to close in*
Upamecano overrated
Harusnya merah
if you barely managed to fill 1 minute of highlights it must have been a very boring and uneventful game
So happy bundesliga is back!!!!!
Bayern dominated the first half , leipzig was better than Bayern in the 2nd half, good , fair result
Captain is Missing Man😢
Silva must be thinking "oh Man! Is this what I should be doing?"
cringe highlights .
red card 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Wonder how the Leipzig goal was allowed, and Bayern’s first one wasn’t lol, crazy.
Union berlin : its time do dream
Szoboszlai surely will win a Ballon d’or
0:35 Wasn't that a Red?
Orban so underrated..Literally the best defender in Bundesliga!
Stonewall redcard, if thats in the prem its a red.
De Ligt had another bad game, but Upamecano played worse. Bayern are missing Lucas Hernandez.
The referee wasn’t fair to Leipzig
Last man! How did that player escape a red?
🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿
How that tackle not red card?
Szoboszlai owned Upamecano in this match
Ojo lepzing ganó al Madrid en su casa cuidado no de la sorpresa con el city
Shocking decision, clear red card
Choupo-Goating still a beast.
Me encanta que Sommer al fin está en un gran equipo. Es un gran portero y ya lo merecía
Red bull sales in munich have got to be at an all time low after these last 2 weeks
RED CARD UPAMECANO ????????? REFEREE??????????
Bro hopefully by some miracle dourtmund can capitalize by this draw and get back into this tittle race
Era roja para Upamecano, Que increíble lo del árbitro
Good & nice Bundesliga comeback. That was a strong match. Good result for the competition.👏
Upamecano's faul was clearly a red card. No doubt.
Szobo>>>Bayern Munich
Szoboszlai the best🇭🇺💪🏻
WHAT A MATCH this is BUNDESLIGA! #MiaSanMia
That second commentator was so so bias for the entire game.. upset me at points
Bayern <3
Bayern still look very poor on defence not gonna go far in Europe
Thanks, RB.
U can get Sané out of Germany but u cannot get Germany out of Sané
Szobozslai and Halstenberg were brilliant ⭐️
Upamecano took him out 🤣🤣🤣
Poor performances by both teams.
Fun game to watch, but sad performance from Bayern. The goals were 🔥🔥though
Leipzig needed to win ideally
Why not red card???!@
👍
good leizig
Upamecano se acordo tarde que tenia que meter
