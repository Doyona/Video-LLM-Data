Boy those horses got Stamina, four miles Around the track with Jumps. Amazing
Still remember this day won £900
£25 = 66/1 = £1675
Noble Yeat's complete failure in the 2024 National.
Thankyou ❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉
Aan Aen
Brilliant
Horse Racing is Just Magic. Love race horses they talk to one
So glad for Sam as he was a real Aintree jockey. He had real affinity with those green fences. Really gifted horseman
The greatest horse race in the world, hands down.
tento debilní dostih v debilní fašistické zemi vyhrávají kdejací chromí koníci.podurovnová záležitost
Congratulations 🎈🍾🎊🎉 Sam
0:48 エクレアサーフの恐ろしい落下
I’m sorry but this looks boring as hell.  Kinda funny when they eat shit though
The old fences took jumping, these look like speed traps
Surely noble yeats be in the first 3 again this year and possibly even any second now
now I am sure Sam Waley-cohen will be more nervous now as an owner than a jockey who riding in The Grand national
R.i.p Discorama and Éclair surf 💔 poor babies.
After Rachel and then Sam I hope this Years Race won't be an anti climax ....
I say back him this Yr gone from 12-1 now 10-1 I will be sticking £10 on it to win
Dear old santini
Altho a lot Safer than it used to be, the National is still the toughest Test out there by Far . All the Loose Horses at half way, and the fact only 15 finished from a Field of 40 proves this. And what a story again Last Ride for Jockey is a victorious one, First amateur Jockey to win for 32 years , and Noble Yeats the first 7 Year old to win for 82 Years. Last Year the First Female Jockey to win, and previous to that first back to back winner  since 1974 .....Still Unique...
Horses should not race in jumping races
Fack you I always bet on long run never win always make me loss now I bet on any second one make me lost again shit jokey

Great!
Too many wacks to the horse to ruin a great ride to victory...usual crap for horses...
Hores mam yasin xaz sal hores no 13 racing today
Finally saw this! Congrats to Noble Yeates, and his connections. Wow!  I am wondering if the course, as of right now, the same course that Battleship won over, many decades ago?
Noble Yeats was genuinely the least backed horse in the bookies where I work. only two people had it
What a race, what a battle, what a disgrace!!!! Too many horses, too long a race, too dangerous. Period!!! 6 horses lost their riders and that endangers everyone!!! Leave to the Europeans to keep barbaric old races going. Shameful. Those poor horses running their hearts out and being pushed/whipped for more.  About time this is abolished and current style races run. Modern racing still proves speed, stamina and strength.  Everytime they go on track their lives are being risked. For what? Cha ching cha ching. A race half that longand with numbers cut in half would be better.
this is a dengerous race, i wonder if no one dead?!
Why did they go round one of the jumps, and are those jumps there permanently in place, or can they be moved?  Silly questions I suppose, but I know diddlysquat about horse racing.
It confuses me how people say that they love horses or that they care about horses but then they go out and do something like this. So many horses fall during jumps racing. If only the world could be a little smarter like Australia recently was and ban jumps racing or better yet, ban racing in general. They say they have strick rules but they don't most of these horses won't even live to be 15 because they'll be sent to a slaughter house. This "industry" is cruel and disgusting.
Este campeão número 28 ele e um grande campeão que ele ganhou a corrida pisando com a direita na língua de chegada parabéns pára o joquei e o cavalo e um campeão....
Save animal
I was rooting for Cocoa Beach, the gray.  I guess he just gave out towards the end.  Probably raced too  hard at the start.  Led most of the way.
Isn't the most famous horse race in the entire world (probably universe) the Kentucky Derby? It's ran in the horse breeding center of the world. I mean the king Secretariat won it for god's sakes.
This was a Proper Grand National Very Exciting Race and Fantastic Result. Shame the Fence bypassed and the screens and Flags tho. Nobody wants that to Happen, but its not as dangerous now. I expect They will soften the Fences again now..thats the problem with the National now Every incident brings a knee jerk Reaction , and They have to keep Changing Things. I bet nexts Years race will be far less exciting .....Sadly....
I am an old man and remember when horses had to be able to jump to get around Aintree. Watching this it seems that the horses in the race only need to be able to get the distance (slightly shorter than it used to be too) to be able to get round. Yet there were many in the race which would not have finished a hurdle race in the old days. If horses are failing to clear an obstacle by two feet or more then surely they cannot be classified as "steeplechasers".  Does anybody else think that the lack of jumping ability is the reason why so many fall at very limited height jumps? Surely falling at such small obstacles is a demonstration of horses which cannot jump and so should not be subjected to racing over fences? My opinion is that it is more cruel to put non jumping horses to such a test than it was when fences were stiffer but only those who were able to jump competed.
Great ride, great horse!!
Can someone tell me the commentator at the start and finish of the race?
Sam the horse only ran for you because you beat the snot out of him at least 13 times from what I hear.
Como siempre, emocionante.. la mejor carrera de caballos del mundo.. Esta vez no hubo suerte con Rachel ..
Pretty hard on the whip...borderline cruelty
Over use of his whip. And 3 horses died.
Love the Grand National it's on my doorstep the energy around Liverpool is fab. 🥂🏇
KENTUCKY DERBY!!!  Worlds most famous race is a UK Jumps race worth $20. Jeeeez. Puh-lease
Okay, forgive me but I NEVER heard of this race before until I saw this video!  Wow!  How can this be the world's most famous horse race and I'm just now hearing about it ?  Mandela effect?  Or maybe I just don't get out much. lol.
0.46 that is stomach churning to watch looks like would've broken neck from the twisting or sustained brain injury
I just feel so saddened by those beautiful animals who 'literally'  sacrifice their lives for pure greedy humanity!
what a thrilling race... Sam Waley Cohen is an awesome jockey and Noble yeats fab team
None of you seem to notice Cohen excessive use of the whip. Sometimes hitting the horse has two effects one is they will dig their heels in and NOT go faster, the other is they are frightened and want to get away from the pain.  One of the better ways to get a response is to growl at them. Horses have very sensitive hearing.
Won me nearly £700
Bet 365 price boost 66/1 thank you mr cohen
Mr Sam Waley-Cohen, the rider of the winner, NOBLE YEATS (IRE), was suspended for 9 days and fined £400, for using his whip above the permitted level from after jumping the last fence and in the incorrect place on the run to the line.
Race spoilt by the fact that Cohen hit the horse above the permitted amount of 8. I counted at least 12 back handers.
I backed the 2nd and 3rd,. But when my season started at chepstow Friday last October whilst looking at very first race I looked at for the day,a race in Ireland looking at the form,I thought that's good form, the horse won it 9/2,  the only race it won, it was noble Yeats.  Then it won national.  Ironic
What a brutal race! Always has been and always will be. Shame Desperado never got to see the finish! It’s cruel, barbaric and unnecessary. Poor creature. Not just him, but all the others over the years who have lost their lives just to feed gambling habits and the like. They are just bred to make the owners money. And please don’t tell me that the owners ‘love’ their horses, cos if they did, they would never put them through such a experience! No doubt I will get some stick for this comment, but don’t really care to be honest. Anyone who can legitimately justify this race must be really sad!
These moments in time are when I miss my HomeLand the most .So essentially understated yet full of poignant emotion for ALL the inspirational figures both woth four & two legs that ARE of no where else in this world   Quinnsiesyially of a small .indefeatable Island Nation .  thank you for giving mey heritage .
Congrats and all that but Emmet Mullins hardly gets a mention- he trained the horse!
I love the National, but I see it said often in England, The Worlds most famous horse race, but I live in France and no one has heard of it here and it's not broadcast.  I'm afraid the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Kentucky Derby or Melbourne Cup are much more famous races.
Any second now should have win that without the con 🤬
What an achievement..horse and rider.
A person "wins" a race through animal cruelty.. over use of whipping, shameful. Fined £400 . Even more shameful.. no winner here, just a retiring person with a whip riding something far more beautiful than this so called "win" .. shame on you let us be glad you're retired now. Ps .bye
lol I was snow leapordess
The national always seems to have a fairytale to it,from Bob champion coming bk from cancer to this being Sam's last ride
What a swansong for Sam wc,to go out winning the world's biggest 🏁 in stature
Ok the Grand National is entertaining but it is above all a big lottery with good-average horses... Any Gold Cup or Grand Steeplechase de Paris horse would easily beat any Grand National horse with an equal weight penalty...
The national is by far and away the worlds greatest horse race, shame one got hurt thoe.
Pity my fancies fell🤦‍♂️all in the game of horse racing. Congrats to the winners. You most certainly deserved to be in the no 1 box!! Stamina & horsemanship made a great combo. 👌
Pure evil.
A disgusting sport and the most evil race in the UK. The fact people find enjoyment watching these beautiful animals made to jump dangerous jumps, pound round a track and see some die out of a need for sick minded humans to get a thrill out of it! Let's watch YOU all made to run fast and struggle to do a course that is unsafe and bet on you. These horses didn't ask to do this, many end up dead before 10 as dog food or broken and they are used and stressed. Bodies are broken and weary for a few short years of being made to pound a race track. Another young horse dead from the stress of this vile race. It needs banning NOW!!!
cruelty to animals to long to many horses
Sam Waley-Cohen is the second amateur to win the Grand National and also the Second Amateur to announce the rite meant the first amateur to win the Grand National and rite amended was the late Great Dick Saunder's
you got to feel sorry for Nick Henderson he had a good relationship with the Waley-Cohen family Nick Henderson's trainer the far as I can see the first winner was won't be gone long in the1991 Topham Chase then some years go bye the Cheltenham gold cup
Superb Race those Fences are still the toughest, except Bechers Brook Horses no longer fall there, the most notorious Fence is now the Safest. Since the Fence was left out on the Second circuit due to an injured Jockey on landing Side in 2018 Grand National, They obviously either reduced the drop even more or lowered the Height of the Fence, because Bechers Brook has been jumped a Total  of 20 Times  in the Autumn and Spring fixtures, Since the 2018 Grand National and there has been only one faller!! I believe officials Thought (Rightly Imho) that the Risks at Bechers should be eradicated to Save the National.
2 horses passed away.
Class had it at 66/1 🏆🏆🏆🍀
in big races a lot of jockeys over use the whip because the reward of winning and keeping the race is worth a few days ban and fine. only elimination will stop this.
Very sad that he was pts, it had talent too, when I saw anibele fly confirmed runner I thought why? The Horse has no interest in the race and won't do well and confirmed my suspensions, --13 years old, surely time they capped the age for safety reasons,don't get me wrong I'm a lover of the sport but there has to be a line drawn over such extreme distances and especially the national fences.What are they trying to achieve?
Disgraceful use of the whip.
...."Congratulations to Winner"..!!!
Well deserved for sams last race when a win has a story or meaning to it i will never will be upset losing my money regardless can't win them all but a good feeling like the owner had  died, and his horse won pulls strings in my heart even if I'm on the looser FACTS
hope everyone chokes on what they won!! two horses lost their lives  for greed!!!
What about the horses that died,Shame on owners&jockeys for putting the horses through that it's cruel!!!!!
I bet on 3 horses after researching them all  and none if them came in and I asked my misses to pick a number between 1 and 50 at random she picked 28 😂 Won her £400 at 66/1 (5EW). I won nothing lol
Where did the name Grand National come from?
I personally have lost my voice .Go on Sam . More than once.
A joyful victory - which took me back to an equally memorable day when Aldaniti won this famous race. My sister who doesn't bet but is a keen student of breeding remarked that she would have chosen Noble Yeats as her selection due to his illustrious forebears.
I wonder how many horses died after the race 🤔 it really should be banned
Why the hell do they have to whip and whip the horses that's abuse
No one was going to beat noble Yeats yesterday even if Sam had to get down off him and carry him across the winning post but the determination from both horse and jockey won it the devil himself wouldn't have passed him.
I had Two for Gold it was at the front for ages then just disappeared .!
Brilliant win for Sam waley Cohen in his last race what a way to bow out.
Has he apologised for his overuse of the whip yet? Very disappointing win-at-all-costs attitude.
Bent twts again coming up with another outsiders to go with many more over the few days of aintree meeting ,as they say you can never win in this game were there's money involved there's evil .
Baffled I that horse won the grand national, it's the equivalent of an Australian donkey winning a grade 1 at ascot, makes no sense
I'm no animal rights person, but things need to change here, every year including this year we have horses dying, would it be ok if at every champions League final 2/3 footballers die, just because there animals this should not happen, most of these massive fences have no spectators near them anyway, so reducing them right down wouldn't make any difference to the race, also whipping a horse is ok, but when that person punched a horse she was in trouble, the both things are just as bad as far as I'm concerned, horse racing will never be banned but just lower the fences and stop using the whip, it's all about money anyway and the crowds will still be there !!
RIP Discorma and Eclair Surf
Not nice. This is the worst Grand National for years. Two horses were brutally killed. No one cares about them. :(
Can remember the first time I heard of the Waley-Cohen name was when a horse called The Dragon Master won a novice chase at 100/1 at Sandown.  Fairly sure Robert was the owner/trainer back then.   Also been racking my brains trying to think of who tipped this horse in the paper/on TV well before Christmas.
I remember meeting Sam at Stratford me and the family got a pic of him with a tiny trophy after the race he won. I wouldn't of believed that he would of won the National the race of dreams. Sam you truly deserve it congratulations enjoy living the dream.
RIP Discorama and Eclair Surf
At work we all bet 2 pound each and I got chosen noble Yeats I thought I’ll loose but no always a change
Stopped Betting on this race a few years ago But as I was betting Thursday Friday, got caught up in the momentum and I got the winner 50/1 got the tip from the betting site which predicted it would finish third
The fences are hardly any size at all you look back to the 70s when it was a true test. Nowadays they just look like big piles of spruce not quite so grand
Another horse murdered by racing.
Congratulations to the whole teams of Noble yeast.xx
I bet on Coco beach .
Banned for 9 days and fined 400 pound for excessive whip use, what a joke!
You have a better chance of your jockey and horse dying and than you do winning.
Minella Times fell because he half landed ontop of another horse on jumping. Was this poor riding from Rachel Blackmore? She was obviously too close. Any thoughts?
Brilliant Commentary From Alan Howes Simon Holt & Stewart Machin   ITV had Mark Johnson Ian Bartlett & Richard Hoiles
Not the most stylish amateur jockey but I take my hat off to you, happy retirement Sam, you are the Simon Walker of the NH discipline. Great wat to bow out, I wish you all the best.
I predicted a 7yr old would win congratulations
Back here in my sitting room in Cheltenham I was screaming COME ON SAM at the top of my voice 100 times. . . . . . . Well done Sam I made my Cheltenham losses back! What a career! What a race! WHAT A FINISH!!!!!!!! Hats OFF to Ya 🙂
They zoomed in to crop out Discorama pulling up. Disgusting sport
Congratulations to the winner but I do find it cruel in some ways especially running over the hurdles when they fall and get hurt plus when terrible things happens to the horses and had to be put asleep so I think when there's horse racing they should stop the hurdles and let them run naturally
Where is Boris Johnson?
The winner is only 7 year old. Amazing.  Another red rum ?
Breeding. Oscar v Yeats. Yeats wins.
This puts YEATS ahead of Fame and Glory as top jumps Sire. Sam deserved the win he certainly had a willing partner  and great training job from E. Mullins. They all looked in shock. This fella could do it again. Sure u want to retire Sam
Yes I did hear it was going to be Sams last ride but all I thought was ...ahhh I hope he runs well. I was never going to back him and I did not hear any tips going his way. But I am happy for their win. Such an amazing story and what a fantastic steer from Sam from the back at the start of the race through the field. He popped the fences for fun. Best horse won on the day.
The way he steered the horse through the field from the back. Great ride. And what a way to bow out. Amazing stuff.
A few months ago everyone was up un arms because a footballer kicked his pet cat, these horses are kickef and whipped and no one says anything, would it be because these horses make a load of money for people? Talk about hypocrisy
o fluminensismo vive
HORSE MURDER AT ITS FINEST.
Should be renamed “The Race Formally Know As The Grand National” and “The Jump Formally Know As Bechers Brook”
Lovely. My choice was 3rd.
Sadly horses were killed in this race
🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
Whipped the shit out of that poor beast
Another fairytale National. Great for Sam, what a way to end your days as a jockey. Also another Mullins winning. Great stuff 👍
Nice to see good old Dave Yates putting his big head into the camera in the background as per usual 😂🤔
What a story again and Sam, the whole family and Emmet Mullins so deserving. Any Second Now can't get any luck. Enjoy Dallen was my pick and of course he's the first to go but he'll have better days I'm sure
What a story again and Sam, the whole family and Emmet Mullins so deserving. Any Second Now can't get any luck. Enjoy Dallen was my pick and of course he's the first to go but he'll have better days
The one thing that stands out is his ability as an amateur is superb. I know without the horse you cant do it  But as as a chase jockey hes been fantastic. A proper horseman  And also strong in a finish  Job done Sam
he was really whipping on Noble Yeats at the finish but it is a little hard to blame him. I'm sure a lot of amateur riders find this win gratifying.
How did that rogue horse win that race? All them class horses and noble yeats wins, baffling result and wouldn’t of backed it with stolen money
Fortescue 🤭 the way the jockey fell though
What a ride 👏  happy retirement geezer 🥳🎊
Good riddance to another jump season. Welcome the flat 👍
This is alwais the most leggendary race on the world.
Get in 💪🏻🍹
Had no chance on official ratings   bookies delight
Excessive use of the whip on 1 and 2nd.......sad!!
Terrific finish well done Emmett Mullins Noble Yeats  Sam whaley Cohen super ride a top class athlete and to do it for his father great story
Easy race had £100 on him nice 5k back. Bet everyone had this horse 🤣🤣🤣
This was more exciting than watching National Velvet!!
Amazing how many people say they had money on it when no ones mentioned it all week
Congragulations to Waley Cohen's, Emmet Mullins and Noble Yeats. Wonderful result. Well deserved victory.
The best race in the world full stop
in 2002 10 hoses fell at the first
RIP  Discorma i had a quid or 2 on him today
14 horses either fell or unseated! most since 2014
Had 25 EW on delta work. Best horse in the race, Thought it was gonna win it 2 out looked like it was cruising but just didn’t pick up
"3 horses died fuck yeah!"  That's what you guys sound like.
Fantastic race 👏🏻👏🏻
Rip Discorama🐎💙
The horse has been lined up for this race if you get a chance watch it’s last 6 runs this does racing no good at all
Had a £5 each way at 66/1
Congratulations!
I only just found out it was Grand National day. It's gone the same way as the cup final and the Derby.
Bi heaven I can remember when you could not see the horse or jockey approaching the fence.Those fences were like hurdles.
Emmet Mullins and Paul Byrne the absolute masters of lining one up! And for SWC to win this on his last ever ride, couldn’t write it. What a race and what an accomplishment 👏🏼
I stuck an each way on Noble Yeats because it's Mark Nobles last season.
Great family moment
So if there was VAR it would have been disallowed. He wouldn't have won. I don't get it?.
the horse that finished 3rd looked as though it was hampered by the first 2
Brilliant. I do miss the old commentators though, like peter o sullivan.
Liverpool does show its ❤️ they come together, right now
£5 E/W at 50/1. A few drinks for me this weekend. Nice one, Sam Waley-Cohen.
I placed multiple bets on the other horses but couldn't remember if I backed Noble Yeats. Then when he and Sam Waley Cohen crossed the line, I was kicking myself for not placing a bet on this horse.  But I did back Noble Yeats after all via my online bookies account and won £62 win and place plus an additional £11 on Santini and Fiddlerontheroof finishing fourth and fifth respectively. GET IN!!! And just for the record it's the fourth time I've backed the Grand National winner after Tiger Roll (2018 and 2019) and Minella Times (2021) 👏👏🐴 😃!!!
What a race I put £20 for him to win
Called it so I'm over the moon! 🥳🥳
What a race, what a battle, what a jockey. Purely stuck a few quid each way on Noble Yeats purely because it was Whaleys last ever race and has the best record over these fences. Incredible
Hope all the horses are ok and the jockeys that fell  Hearing all horses got back safely but some have needed assessments 😢
What a way to retire  He was in the pack for most of it but turned on the gas towards the end  50/1 And he won  Ending on a high
sam waley cohen and noble yeats wins the grand national so cool😍🤑😃😎
