Thank you ZAYN and Ingrid this song is soo heavenly perfect. Happy St Patrick’s Day and 1Yr to this AmaZAYN song. Xx
A song that once gave me hope, today gives me new horizons. Taking off the rose colored glasses is hard, but I know I can begin again, I know God knows who, where & when, We only need to trust Him & be obedient to His calling for us. 💜🙏✝️
knew this song from Sharlene San Pedro, this is truly a comforting song 🥺💓
Zayn saved me from drugs.

PERFEIÇÃO

Thank you sm for making this song and letting us hear this masterpiece
_When the world was ending_ _I'd hold you in my arms_ _And we talked about the places we'd never been_ _When the world was ending_ _We'd hold onto the past_ _'Cause it's all we thought that we would ever see_ _But then the sun came right back_ _And the birds sang as if nothing had happened_ _And, it's alright, It's ok_ _We will get another day_ _To begin again, to begin again, to begin again_ _I don't know how_ _I don't know why_ _But I know that I will try_ _To begin again, to begin again, to begin_ _To live and love and breathe again_ (...) _And cry because I'm happy_ _And hold my friends like long lost lovers_ _Be kind to me and love each other_ _The world keeps spinning on_ *It's alright, It's ok* *We will get another day* _I don't know how, I don't know when_ *But I do know that we can* *Try to begin again, to begin again* *To begin to live and love and breathe again* ~~~~~~~ Avremo altri giorni per ricominciare, per dimenticare, per guarire, per ridiventare, per amare e amarci, per essere felici... Abbiamo tante nuove albe da vedere. Il mio desiderio, stanotte e per indefinite notti, è quello di poterle vedere con te al mio fianco  Sei amato e t'amo, sono felice di amarti, mi sento amata  A(i) domani 💜🤝🧡
This song is free therapy for us
YO: RANDO
Crying
I love the song! The lyrics speaks volumes about life(to me).What I get is not only the hope  of starting again with life but also of a fondness of the memories of the past, of missing those from those memories, of understanding of what happened, and of acceptance of it and of life itself.  I would say this song capsulized the totality of life itself.
this song makes me hopeful. thank you.
This is beautiful❤
Commenting to give Ingrid her dues, always able to belt out a haunting melody while encapsulating a mix of complex emotions. She's been around a long while and helped me out in her own way when i was a teen. Zayn was pretty good too, but Ingrid is not to be pitied with the comments essentially saying he is giving her charity.
So beautiful 🥺🥲
The song is just so beautiful
9/7/2021✨💛To all Malaysian. Sending so much LOVE AND LIGHT. EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY🙏✨⚡
Pov you just came from love island😭
The pandemic anthem

Enk jen
Zayn ❤
Im just falling in love with this song<33
Amazing song I LOVE IT .
This song made me cry i love zayns music and ingrids voice is wow
this song has a soothing vibe for me. the lyric is simple, understandable, yet meaningful at the same time. it represents the current condition with covid 19 pandemic etc.   at the end of the day, there will be a light and hope for us, all over the world.  please be happy and healthy. we can get through this situation together. thank you Ingrid and Zayn
I know this is zayn. While I dont know the title of this song. It is really amazing
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
There's a disney touch in this song, isn't it?
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🤗 zayn

This reminds me so much of She-ra season 5... lmao
Nice to hear again zayn❤❤❤
Just wanted to testify that it is the MERCY OF GOD that keeps the world spinning... " He makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust" (Matthew 5:45) the lyrics in this song take the end of the world so lightly and romanticized but it will be everything but light and romantic when Jesus comes the second time around... Acknowledge your Creator and stop living as your own gods!
_masterpiece_ 🤍
That's a piece of art 💕
Outstanding Vocals.....
I cannot understand how such a wonderful song can be seen so little that it is really beautiful ❤

It is such a motivating song in this horrible pandemic. When every moment, you go through the fear of losing your lives. Its like we are living a movie and zombies became alive, trying yo kill us. But lets hold hands and look forward to the future when we will be living freely again, we will be able to breathe freely in open air without wearing mask,we will be able to hug our families, go back to universities  and hang out with friends fearlessly.Lets hope for the best.  Live the best life of yours, cz you get your precious life only for once

And Zayn OMG, his voice is just truly the most purest, angelic voice that just fits this song so well. Ingrid and Zayn sound beautiful together. This is one of my top favourite songs right now. Amazing work both Ingrid and Zayn!! ❤️

masterpiece
this takes me back to the old times. I've been ingrid's "biggest" (probably not biggest) fan since...well, since she started. i'm so glad she finally gets the fame she has always deserved.

The only thing that worries me is that the song ended so soon 😟❤️
i'm crying because he sounds so happy here. daddy zayn is finally happy, and live happily. Khai, Gigi and Zquad will never leave his side. :)
This is a master piece and that high note similar as dusk till dawn 🔥  And that lyrics are hell awesome ❗😤😤
2:47 I get chills everytime
The best song I've ever heard❤️love u zayn
Nice song ,so relatable Now,their voices blend well,it is magic🎶😚👌🙏✌
This song has helped me at my worse, my life sucks and I just hate myself so much but this song helps me. Thank you, Ingrid & Zayn
Zsquad !!!!! Let's Goo🔥
Waiting for the _music video_ ✨
I wish people would stop using “underrated” as a compliment. I know it’s meant well most of the time... but it’s like saying I like this, people should like it too, they should, but they don’t. Can we please just compliment the talent instead of so many people focusing on the popularity and ratings. I don’t know too many artists that enjoy being called underrated. This song was not created to try to gain fame. It was created to share a beautiful message to those that hear it.
Whyyyyy it is soo underrated!!
Zayn supports rising artists rather than collaboration with other popular singers just for sale of views, He is Great 😭❤️
Khai doesnt turn on the tv She makes Zayn sing for her whenever she wants, without even buying tickets and without going on tour
No entiendo por qué su post en Instagram acerca de esta canción tiene +1.8 millones de likes y la canción apenas tiene +1.1 millones 🥺 El Zquad no está apoyando como debería ):
Don't worry you're  not the only one listening to this masterpiece for the billionth time on repeat
Zayn doesn't need Grammy, Grammy needs Zayn 😎🔥
I like this song
Love ya all
🤩
Ingrid is by far the best singer right now! This song is incredible as always🥰
Does anyone else think that the "when the world was ending" part kinda sounds like the "wait a minute" part in 8 by billie eilish It cant be just me right?! Lol
Your voices are so wonderful
This song deserves much more recognition.
🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐
Zayn is just like 'A king who don't want to rule'. He has talent but he doesn't want popularity.☹️☹️☹️
I am in a situation where I know that only God can see me through it and after listening to this song,  from being depressed and upset to being relieved and relaxed. This song is so soothing and comforting, i'm crying •́  ‿ ,•̀ Makes me feel at peace. This will be my forever comfort music that whenever that I am in a mellow-mood I'd always go back and listen to this to forget about all my worries. The song and the lyrics are so beautiful, it brings me the happiest tears and emotions. Thank you my Zaynie and Ingrid (っ˘з(˘⌣˘ )
(*˘︶˘*).｡*♡
(◍•ᴗ•◍)❤
Such a beautiful song...
i press shuffle play and then i realise i keep going till this song comes up
They both are gem❤️❤️❤️
No puedo creer cómo abandonaron tan rápido a esta hermosa canción, tan infravalorada que duele
We want Music video with Zayn
I just want to cry listening to this, it's too beautiful
their voices sound so good together omg
Perfect and beautiful❤❤🌟
A music video is coming soon. Ingrid twitted.
This piece is so so so calm and relaxing..... Every single word is just so good
This piece is so so so calm and relaxing..... Every single word is just so good
I'm waiting for the official music video to come out.  would be so amazing⚡
A song from heaven ❤️
WHY DO I JUST SEE THIS NOW.... LIKE UH ZAYN WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US
This song is giving  me hope, so much hope.
Probably the music video will be dropping in this week. Let's STREAM it to atleast 2 million views.
I sent this to my best friend and he thought it would be great to listen to it before going to bed (I thought exactly the same) i love em and i love this song so much
I want to believe in the words in this song but it's hard when you're living in a Province heading into another lockdown because of Covid
From the past few days I was feeling really down, I felt like I want to end everything.... And Right now I made my sister hear this song and I told her that this song gives me hope that this covid situation will go soon and everything will be normal again and then she said that she wants everyone to die and earth to get destroyed, and after such a long time I told her that no I want to live and try new things, things I've never did before, I want to live and enjoy.  It was usually me who wanted all the humans to die(including me) because everyone is fucked up and all these environmental crisis, so I always prayed that the world should end and all these corrupt people should have the most painful death, but today I realised that I actually wanted things to get better and also make things better instead of things to end.  I can proudly say that it's because of this song, it is full of hopes, it gives me a new perspective about life.  Thankyou so much ZAYN and INGRID.
3:10 dead me💖
when heard about this collab I was so excited, now I'm even more, cause this is a masterpiece and I want to listen to it over and over, it's a song full of hope and I needed it
The editor don't want us to read I guess.

,097,
ATTENTION all directioners  True directioners will read this  As you all know 11 years has passed since 1d was formed so we are going to put songs like more than this, and up all night etc, on the charts we can do this , we can show how strong we are and still are.   As you might also know drag me down is so close to 1 billion view but story of my life isn't , if we could crash websites within seconds then this bus easy for us. But to get all of this accomplished we could start days before July 22 but we can do this, let's prove them wrong. Copy and paste this and reshare half of our fandom is sleeping come on  #louies #harries #ZSQUAD #naillers #payenette
STR3AM!
Normalize simpin for zayn
i'm STILL getting goosebumps after hearing it on RepEaT
I love this song 💞😍 zayn voice so soothfull loved it both Ingrid too
"Zayn is getting underrated"  ZAYN: It's alright, it's ok...
🤍
Ingrid and Zayn’s voice blend in such a comforting manner. This song is so damn beautiful and uplifting. I haven’t heard Zayn’s voice in so long and it really made me tear up. His voice brings so much nostalgia and happy memories. Mix that with Ingrid and the beautiful lyrics - masterpiece. I’ll be coming back daily. ♡
This is so beautiful
Zayn so cool
088.572
Im from an add from tiktok and most people that saw it gave alot of comments on who is Ingrid... they were like "Who the fuck are you" or "Why would zayn collab with you" and it is disgusting
They don't know this song is masterpiece 😍
אוקיי זאין והיא זה שילוב ושלם אז מה יקרא שזאין ואריאנה יעשו שילוב אומיגדדדד אני פשוט יתפוצץ
Ingrid Michaelson is a brilliant singer, check out lotto and celebrate but this is ok too

Honestly though everyone in the comments is talking about zayn and he was great but she I grid was also rlly good omg perfect duo
Both of you  😌💕
Why do we have just 1m views
Hi. I listened to this song early this morning, after sent my wife to the hospital. She pregnant, and got SLE. Which mean it’s 50:50 for us to keep the baby, or get abortion. While i was listening to this song that been reccomended in youtube, it hits me hard. I cried a lot, but at the same time, it reminds me that this is not the end, just keep trying and fighting because we got each other. Thank you for this great song. The voices, the lyrics, the music are packed really well. I hope a lot of people will hear this beautiful song.  Such a masterpiece.  Lots of love from Malaysia 🇲🇾 💕
Love this song
at the end, zayn's voice sounded undescribably therapeutic
Who needs therapy when I got this for free.
This is the first Ingrid song I've heard and OMG THE TALENT🙌🏻

This song is literally heaven. Don't lie!!!!
5th march  Me and my girlfriend broke up cause i lied to her and that affected her But ik she still loves me🥺 This song gave me some hope♥️♥️♥️
Nobody can beat zayn !!!🔥
my ass re listening to this song after 'Zayn is married" Trend on Twitter
ATTENTION CALLING ALL DIRECTIONERS    As you all know, the 11 year anniversary is coming up on the 23rd of next July. But we have some projects we must complete before then. Those targets are as follows;    1) Even though songs like More than this, best song ever, etc, have hundreds of millions of views,  it's still not what they deserve.  We have decided to stream the song on July 22nd, the day before the 11 year anniversary to get the song to charts. Maybe we have to start streaming a little bit beforehand, but still. We need to stream the song on every possible platform; YouTube, Spotify, iTunes, Amazon music etc. If this is the same group of people who sold FNB stadium within a minute, then why couldn't we be able to do this?    2)  This was planned a year ago, but this time we could easily do this. The second project is to stream drag me down, which as we can see is so close to 1 billion views, but, story of my life isn't, so we will stream story of my life on July 18th (The last Sunday before the anniversary) and make the masterpiece number 1 on that day. I think none of the above are difficult tasks, but that's only if we spread the words. So kindly spread the words.    Copy and paste this, guys, believe me we can do it! I know we kinda planned it last time and fell short, but we can do it if we try harder
Más reconocimiento plis
they could use it in a grey's anatomy episode
Omg zayn i love you😑✌🏼🥺
i can listen to this all day!!!
why haven't i ever heard ingrid's songs before!!?!!!?!?! she is so talented and i am so happy that i got to listen to get angelic voice. she is really talented but underrated.
-And hold my friends like long lost lover.  I cry.
This is going to be my wedding song. Hands down.
*We need a video 😩*

THIS SONG IS SO UNDERRATED !!
idk how many times i’ve listened to this... ITS SO GOOD 😊
Zayn a and u voices are awesome
Zayn es todo lo que está bien,♡
this is a masterpiece, god
Beautiful! ❤️
Such a beautiful song
I like how he collab with underrated artists
My name is also ingrid 🙂
0:33 “...beauty and the beast...” Love it here
Notice how he doesn’t collab with the famous ones but the talented ones
이 노래는 나를 느끼게 해 그가 한 방향에 대해 말하는 것처럼..
To begin again♥️
Mantap. I love this song
This  collaboration  is  better  than  with SYD , looks like Zayn  wants  to  make  music  with artists  whose  names some  people  will never  hear.  If that's  the case then I'm  down for it.
This song so amazing, zayn i love you 😭😭 really2 love yr voice honey 😭😭😭
✨🤍
I cant- both their voices are amazing I cant stop listening
Best wishes...
i'm here cause it's 25 March
pov: you're listening to this song with rain in the background
So Zqaud give a listen to Hurt by Zayn if you missed it out (it's on the channel inzayn because RCA sold the song and it never got released by Zayn)
Zayn's voice 👌👌👌
ITS SOOO CALMING ....PLEADE MAKE A MUSIC VIDEO ON THIS ONE
Just imagine Zayn Malik callaboration with Ariana grande, that song would be full of high notes 😂
Reminds me of aire by intocable
i miss this zayn voice
ALL DAY ALL NIGHT DJ MALIK
Only came for Zayn.
Just a brilliant, beautiful song at the perfect moment of hopefully post-Covid spring. The opening lines of 'when the world was ending' are particularly moving, because that's how it really felt. Kudos Ingrid!
Zayn can run over me with his car and I would say sorry
i’m so surprised that it hasn’t reach 1 million yet like it’s so underrated
‘just a bradford boy’ look at him now
Feels like it gon be a title track for a drama movie
#IlleniumRemix Mine - Without Me - Don't Let Me Down https://youtu.be/586YMtMFkwE
love this
Zayn's voice is like drugs that make you so much happier
His voice brings peace to my heart!
Deep✨♥️
THE ZAYN'S VOICE MY GOD
🔥🔥🔥
Omg you guys.. His voice in here is just soo touching :(  I mean his voice is always soo good.. but in here I felt like it became even more angelic :(
Hope when the music video lands this song receives the recognition it deserves cos the lyrics have a big meaning
can't stop the tears rolling down... perfectly blending harmonies, absolutely beautiful ♡
So healing
Most of us are Zayn fans i can swear
I’m obsessed with this song
Bu şarkı daha fazlasını hak ediyor
This song is marvelous 🥺
I feel pity for people who hate zayn just bcz he left 1D or think he is jealous of Harry Styles....Comeon...have a life....he is such a gentle soul.
This hits different if you feel like your life's over and it cant be OK
came for zayn stayed for ingrid. amazing  vocals.
Random but I think its the perfect closing song for Attack on titan animated series
Beautiful song❤️
Good night
Zaynn🔥
Str3am To Begin Again!
The dislikes are from people who can't begin again
This is my comfort song, I have family issues and my uncle died last week. It’s really sad to see my mom cry
I'm not crying, you're the one
oh my good, que bella voz la de ambos. Una delicia auditiva.
this song is BEAUTIFUL !!!
This is sooo beautiful and so calming 💕 and seriously zayn has the best vocal ever! His highnotes and verses always impress me! I'm proud of him 💗💗
That dude cannot sing at all.  Just mush mouth...
Zayn you are the best !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The song's rhythm just fits so well with the angelical voice of Zayn.
Es normal que siga sin superar esta canción?
Im always fan of his high note.

Definitivamente Khai tiene al papá con la voz más angelical del mundo.

What will the people who dislike the video go through their heads ???
My national anthem to start studying
Ok... Am I the only one who is fan of Ingrid and doesn't know who is Zayn? 😅
Imagine if there is a music video soon of this song ? 🥺💗💗💗
Ou my eyes
True fact: Who thinks that this song will deserve to be win collaboration of the year❤️❤️❤️ 👇🏻
When two beautiful souls meet
Just closed you eyes and listened zayn's part
This is incredibly beautiful, I'm in love 🥰
Suka bgtt 😭
Jesus❕Save this Masterpiece in any cost from Tik-Tokers 🙏
I don’t get it, zayn is always underrated and looked over. He deserves so much Grammys. Hollywood is sometimes unfair af
Bro this song is so powerful
Gorgeous song, beautiful message. We will begin again.
Why isn’t this viral yet?
This song is sounds like telling their own disney fairlytail
listening to this song is like leaving ur own self coz this is heaven. deserves more!
And I thought I couldn't love zayn more than I do. 😭❤💕
I can only see comment about Zayn what about Ingrid she did a great job!!!!!
Zayn always looks for talented singers rather than popular singers, for collaboration. This makes him different from the rest. 💖🥺
I almost forgot abou Ingrid Michaelson!! ZAYN bring me here
if zayn promote his song then he will be the best singer in the world
Their voices fit perfectly together
his voice totally heaven
I love this song so much GOSH
Literally sounds like a song that would play in a death scene in a movie 😢 THEY BOTH CRUSHED IT.
this better win a Grammy for best colllab!!
Im crying this is beautiful
I FUCKING LOVE THIS SONG!!!
is this the zayn from one direction?
Zaddyyy😍😍
Angelic voice ❤ in that bridge zayn hit those indian classical type notes sooooo perfectly 😍😍
Thanks you ingrid and thank you zayn
Yahh Zayn we want to Begin Again 🙏🙏
I came here for Ingrid.  Zayn is ok too.
Hey Zayn,  I have just found out I haven’t got into my first choice sixth form. I am really upset I tried my absolute hardest and was really feeling positive about how it went.   I don’t know where it went wrong, I have done numerous shows , I am head girl and tried really hard in the aptitude workshop 😩.  I really want to do acting, and the other school which I did Get into, has really high entrance grades and will have me doing courses I don’t want to do 😭  I’m really devastated I didn’t get in 😭 I’m so glad I have this song to listen to 🥰 xxxx
This song is so soothing ❤️  Thank you Ingrid and Zayn for blessing us with this song 🥰
i need someone who can reminds me this song
one of the most beautiful song ive ever heard VOCALS
la nota alta, voy a llorar
It is such an exquisite song with the power of lifting up people's hope and will 'to begin again'. Both Ingrid and Zayn did a fantastic job on the vocals and the lyrics are beautiful. I will definitely come back to this beautiful piece of work frequently in the future.
If you are also obsessed with this song... Then, *Hey! Same* 🙋
Grammys, Admit it; You regret not nominating Zayn... And you are streaming this song on loop in your room before sleep 🙂
Grammys, Admit it; You regret not nominating Zayn... And you are streaming this song on loop in your room before sleep 🙂
I'm so happy Zayn is finally making music he wants to and is collaborating with people he listens too even if they aren't necessarily huge
This is the best song he's done. LOVE THIS.
UNDERRATED
this song really gives me hope that everything will be alright. When I listen to that song I have these kind of chills and thoughts which tell me that you’ll get through everything you’re currently struggling with. “we will get another day to begin again” I started to believe that we actually will. Today I got to know that my mum developed a heart disease of hers so I was crying the whole day but I also want to help and that song gave me that power ❤️
ZAYN doesn't need grammy. The Grammy needs ZAYN. AS he doesn't promote his songs and as he doesn't collab with famous producers and artists, he is so underrated and not valued enough of getting nomination in grammy though he has a terrible potential to compete others.The selection must be made more fair for the deserved ones
Zayj is one of such a talented artist who has got a mature and angelic voice. His deep male voice along with the high pitch notes that he adds along with it is just superb. The combination of such sounds gives an extra value to the song. Zayn is a f**kin legend.
voice
creí que había escuchado dos angeles...y solo eran Zayn e Ingrid// I thought I had heard two angels ... and it was just Zayn and Ingrid
kerennya baba :(
This song is a masterpiece and Zayn and Ingrid are criminally underrated...
My bunny died today in my arms and now this song💔 i miss her soo much🖤 she was only 3 years old... i tried to revive and she just looked up to me and she blinked and she gave up...
this has been the highlight of march. thank you
OMG I cried on his part  but I really love it
Tear jerker for sure...
I love how he just dropped this on her channel and i found out about this bc it was on my home page recommendation bc i like zayn's songs. His fans are real fans bc he doesnt promote his stuff.
Wow beautiful Voice Zayn 🙌💯🎤
his voice.. 😍😍😍
This is amazing!!!
"Mashallah, Zayn giving high note like a adzan"😌
love this sound. More relaxing. thanks for beautiful day. More again.
790k views only!? ARE WE SERIOUS!?
THERE IS NOT A SINGLE ZAYN MALIK SONG YOU CAN LISTEN TO JUST ONCE. YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO IT ON  A LOOP FOR 17 DAYS STRAIGHT BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN THINK OF LISTENING TO ANOTHER SONG. i.e. IF HE DOESN'T DROP ANOTHER SONG.
zayn is so underrated i hate it how fake OT5s say they support Zayn but dont know this song..... i mean ist the most beautiful song ive ever heard......i mean why isnt this on the top of the charts or something
I feel so lucky to find this gem 💎 😘
the people who disliked this song are TASTELESS
Still waiting the MV.. out
1:57 My life long depression fades away when Zayn says  "It's alright it's okay"
Zayn doesn't need a grammy, grammy needs zayn.  Periodt.
This song was needed to heal the world 🧡❤
Cool stuff
Zayn: when the world was ending...we loOoo0ooOoo00oooked~ up at the sky Me: well i'm out...and dead too sir
Zayn tu chaaa gayii♥️
khai would never get depression
bro this song is so underrated how does it not have 1 million views yet!!!
when zayn said "and it's alright it's ok we will get another day" i feel like z try to calm me down
This song hits home i don't know how, i don't know why
Ingridd i love you

INCREDIBLY PROUD OF ZAYN!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE U AND THE MAN THAT U HAVE BECOME. AAAAAAAAA THIS IS SUCHHH A BEAUTIFUL SONG WITH A BEAUTIFUL MEANING 😭♥️
This call a beautiful masterpiece, i'm healing just hearing his beautiful voice..

Just... Thank you for sharing this song to us. I found so many hope and comfort in this song, it's such a blessing. I simply needed to hear this. Thank you Ingrid & Zayn. ❤️ xx

Her voice is similar to Zhavia ♥️
Oowww i love that song ^^
What a Wonderful Song!
The fact that in an interview Zayn says he’s not musically trained and yet he’s the best male vocalist out there. 🤯🤯
I feel jealous from Khai 🙁😔
1:23 i love this
came here for Zayn but leaving as a ingrid fan
Zayn, always best🖤.
Wonder if Zayn did the drawing for this video and for album.
First time I hear ingrid he is so underrated why ? Damn she is so good❤️❤️
Wow!
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU
This is my safe song.
This gives me goosebumps 😭
I can’t wait till I find this radio
This is a strong and lovely song...i'm melting..and tearing a little bit😭😭😭..
Zayn que orgulho
Zayn has the most iconic and unique collaborations ever
This song is so peaceful
"and it's alright, it's okay we will get another day". 💖
This is truly beautiful.....❤️❤️❤️❤️ #BeginAgain
this is the most beatiful song ive ever heard. fr i cant get enough
This is so incredibly beautiful
Love this sm
🌹🤟👼🏻
EU TE AMO ZAYN! EU TE AMO DEMAIS.
b e a u t i f u l
🥺
Zayn vocals are awesome
:;))
me: I'm depressed zayn: I got yah homie
The vocals, lyrics and everything on this song is a masterpiece
❤️❤️❤️
I felt this lyric by meaning
His voice can calm anyone 🥺❤️
капец уже как раз слушал его и очень прикольный трек, просто послушайте https://youtu.be/X_SXjpuJKKs
Masterpiece
😍😍😍😍😍
Marvelous
So beautiful 😢💚
This song is a perfect blend of zayn and ingrids voice ...
It's a pure masterpiece 😍😍 .it's so soothing
This is how many people want a music video of this song 👇
Most of the comments on this video are for Zayn Just how talented he is but I think that we should appreciate the female singer too , both of them are talented
Ingrid has been perpetually underrated for 15 years, so if a spotless vocal with Zayn helps open her up to others, then that's a-o-fucking-kay.
good song👀✨
underrated song
Niall Horan: We''ll be alright, Still Harry Styles: We'll be alright, Fine Line Zayn: And it's alright, it's okay, To Begin Again One Direction: And it's alright, Home  Now we're supposed to be nothing but alright
What is wrong with everybody I- This is so much better than wap, say so and best friend. This is talent.
2:27 Thats a healing !! One of the best bridges i've ever heard. And zayn's signature riffs and vocal runs in the background that builds the tempo just takes it to a higher place. Amazingly written and sung by Ingrid as well. Too good!
Zayn never collaborated with someone who is famous isn't much talented but Zayn only collab with the people might be famous or unknown but he/she has to be damn talented.
How can someone dislike this song!? Do you even have taste??
1:19 and an angel enter in the song 🌟🌅
went through hell last year and i'm only just starting to feel like myself again and this song encapsulates my feelings so well. i'm so grateful to ingrid and zayn for this song :(
Amazayn🤩
Nice
Imagine this song is dedicated to One Direction 🥺
Ever been in love? I have with Zayn and this song🥺🖐🏾
Zayn is like an angel...
❤
This is Masterpiece 🥺❤️
A proper music video will take this song to next level ...out of this world
Ingrid Michaelson you are like amazing ☺️
omg this is one of my new favorite songs and i’ve only listened to it twice i can’t believe how beautiful this is wow

I got tears 💧💧💧💧
Oh zayn. 💛
This is such a masterpiece well done  😍
wow what an unexpected duo
iloveyouuu zaaayn
Ingrid ❤️ Zayn ❤️
me: the title reminds me of Taylor's song titled 'Begin Again' from Red. also me: being a big Swiftie and a Directioner.
in the last of this song, zayn's voice likes in his song, tightrope.
I'm obsessed with their voiceeee. What a lovely song ❤
that is AMAZING
I came here because of Zayn but let’s not forget to appreciate Ingrid’s stunning vocals too.
❤️❤️❤️
I'm obsessed means I'M LITERALLY OBSESSED!!!!!
Thank you so much Zayn! It isn't too late for me to love this girl right?😭😭😭 I am now literally obsessed with her and her voice!!
great song .I fucking love it so much .I can't stop myself from hearing this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  l like this video if you iove this songs.

One of the best of KING ZAYN. Hail to the 👑 king.. He has got such a big heart and no ego that he himself approached Ingrid for the song!!!!!
This is such a heartfelt, beautiful and emotional song/but inside it is something that makes me smile!!
this song speaks to me
wow perfect
Zayn needs to collaborate with more talented artist like Ingrid
ok, i'm crying right now! the lyrics are extremely touching and beautiful omg
Esto es lo más bonito que he escuchado en mi vida
You sound very familiar. I'm going to explore some more of your stuff. This is beautiful. To begin again. Yup. That's where I'm at. Some big stuff coming up and a lot of work but Son, son-in-law, other sons x my daughter inlaw and her 2 boys, my grandbabies - waiting for a new beginning for all of us. California is home, too. 3 long years in the upside down South.
This song is just soo damn beautiful & calm ZAYNNNNN❤️❤️
Was originally here for Zayn but she’s fireeee too 🔥❤️
‘but then the sun came right back’
free therapy

Love you zayn Forever will support you

I don’t know why but this song is so soothing and I wanna listen to it again and again. Like you can associate it with everyday problems in your life and you are like completely broken and have a view that yeah we can create everything from starting and do better than before. ( + Zayn and Ingrid’s voices are so good )
This song is taking over the whole world 🌍 It's so comforting , Thanks Ingrid and Zayn❤️ You just fueled my will to live 🙏 I've listened to this multiple times already and I can't help but cry everytime 😭
Zayn is the most talented singer, composer, writer of current time. No matter who is gaining popularity
I LOVE IT!
I'm really obsessed to this beautiful song i never hear before 😭😭💓💓
i dedicate this song to all my fellow Tanzanians. I know right now we feel like our world is ending because we have lost our hero, our president JPM. But am sure God will give us a new way to begin again our lives without him.. Rest In Peace our beloved president, you will always live in our hearts.
صداى بهشتيش 🙂🔥

This song gives such positive vibes 😍❤
After everyone's last breath on earth, the soul (spirit) goes to a new place; that's either Heaven or Hell.  How is heaven? heaven is a very good place with no sins, sorrows, crying, lust, greed; in other words there is no sin there and it’s full of joy.  How is hell? Matthew 13:50 (UKJV) “And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.” Hell is very terrible and it’s very very hot, you can’t survive placing your hand on a hot stove for 10 seconds, don’t even think you will withstand burning there without being consumed, The thing here is you will be burned without being consumed in hell the same same way you boil a hard rock in water you will be there for eternity, Again after judgement you will be thrown in lake of fire forever.   Hell is a place of suffering from intense tormenting, so why choose to go there instead of going to Heaven?   Here is the steps you must read, understand and believe in order to be sure you will be on your way to Heaven.   Salvation Jesus said, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:6). He also said, "I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved" (John 10:9, NASB). Jesus is not only the way to heaven, he is also the door to heaven.  Realise you are a sinner; Isaiah 64:6 (UKJV) But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses(the quality of being morally right) are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.  Deserving hell for sins Realise that you deserve hell for your sins;  Romans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH. In Genesis 2:17 God warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit. They disobeyed God, but didn't DIE physically until hundreds of years later. Why? It's because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12). Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are not the same. Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead. The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15). All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that Jesus Christ got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at The Great White Throne of Judgment and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever.   Repent So repent, Repenting means: to change your mind; a sincere turning away, in heart, mind and action; Therefore God wants you to repent of sinful values and of sinful living. God wants you to decide to follow Him and to make Jesus the Lord of your life.  No other way  If you want to go to heaven, you've got to go through the door marked "Jesus Christ." There is no other entrance.  By no other entrance it means belief in gods, Buddha, Muhammad or other beings or objects cannot save you; But only belief in Jesus Christ our Lord can save you.  Hebrews 10:4, 10 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.   Any other form of sacrifice be it animal sacrifices it can't save you but we are only saved through the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ.  No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus Christ did for you as simple as that.   Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  Believe  All you need to do is to truly believe with your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ suffered and got crucified and shed his blood for your sins at the cross, He was buried but rose again on the third day just to prove he was God and now alive in heaven. After that you will receive the holy spirit and you will know that you are going to heaven after death or when Jesus comes back while you are still alive.  After believing at Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.   Romans 6:10-11 For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.  As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life. Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag..
Very sweet song.
Zaynnnnn
This is now my comfort song ❤
OMG THEIR VOICES FIT SO WELL 😻
im addicted to this song

🔥🔥
Now tell me Grammys how this man never been nominated?😤
I love You Zayn Malik ❤️ beautiful song and perfect voices.🤩💖
This song ❤️ I don't have words to describe it. I love it ❤️
i came for zayn and stayed for both of them tbh. i’ve never heard ingrid’s music before but damn her voice is beautiful too!
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
Tremendo arte
I am getting positive vibes after listen this song..
The fact that he didn't promote his own album but promoted this song bc he knew we needed reassurance means so much
I am playing this music like 10 times in a day
My ears feel blessed
Zayn's voice is majestic, I love his voice makes me feel very calm.
Beautiful voices and lyrics. We must appreciate them for making this beautiful song.
I am a fan of zayn, but I admit that harry is way above him nowadays

First time listen it : "nah, don't really like it" Second : "oh it's not bad" Third : "wow the lyrics is kinda relate" Fourth : "this is banger. I'm addicted!"
3 min mark thereabout reminded me of Raign's "knocking on heaven's door". I love that song and I love this one too!

zayn ❤️
As a fan of Zayn. I was obsessed with the chart rank after every single realise. I always want em to do well on the chart. I'd checked every chart to see where the singles spot. Past few years most of the time I'd disappointed that such a great songs couldn't get spot. But recently I understand that Zayn doesn't care about charts or fame so who the hell I'm. If he's delivering as a loyal fan of his music I'll be listening even if the world forget him
This song slaps in a different way
this song reminds me of breakup
True fact:Zayn is singer who has the most beautiful and angelic voice ever
masterpiece ✨
Amazayn😍
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Baba and mba Ingrid💗!

Must want to appreciate  this female singer,her voice is soulful  And zayn as usual gave a heartattack  Congrats both 👏💓
The last note just gonna remind you the iconic Zayn ❤️
Ingrid is just perfect the fact that she wrote this song 😙🤌
This song is a classic. I can see it being played even 20yrs from now. A song about hope, after a devastating year the world had seen. We will come out of it. Its alright, it is okay. We will begin to live and love and breathe again.
💛❤
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming
LET'S GET RICH, INGRID SAID
perfect 🤍
Pure masterpiece.....  I want this song to last forever 😭😭😭❤🥺🥺❤🥺💜💜💜

ÇOK GÜZEL

This guy is so good. He should collab with Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Liam Payne, Niall horan.
Its zayn
beautiful song 😍❤️👌
*It's time to repent and seek JESUS* .He gave his life, and suffered the wrath of the Father in the cross, to save you from a eternal hell. For God loves you, but the sin must be punished. On the third day He raised from the death, showing to the world that He is God. So stop sinning and clean your life. He returns soon to judge and destroy the sinners. *Read the Bible.* *THE END IS NEAR.*
I was just waiting for ZAYN to sing...❤❤
It’s alright  It’s ok We will get  Another day .
🔥💯🙌🏽
I have an exam half an hour later and I listen to this to relax before the exam 😌
Let me tell you HOW surprised I was when I saw Ingrid had a collaboration with Zayn ! It's amazing ! Also, you might not now Ingrid but you've surely heard her songs before or even songs she wrote for other artists ! She is overwhelmingly talented.
"when the world was ending, we looked up at the sky and we talked about the last song that we'd play" So beautiful voice, so beautiful lyrics, so beautiful song. 😢🤩🤩❤️
Zayn said he reached ingrid out first, and i realize that she is amazing
Since I see mostly comments about Zayn (yes, I do love his voice too), I’d like to applause both Ingrid Michaelson and Zayn for this beautiful song that made me very happy right now.
His voice, cant handle
The messages this song bring are so damn right. Thank you🙏🏻
I can’t stop saying how much this song makes me feel like I am in heaven  ):
Who needs a Grammy when you're Zayn???!! Damn Grammy needs you, Zayn!!

AMOOOO
When you die the real you( the spirit inside your body) either goes to Heaven or hell. Going to either path depends on if you accepted or you rejected Jesus Christ as the savior.  Heaven is a very good place with no sins, sorrows, crying, lust, greed; in other words there is no sin there and it’s full of joy.  Hell is very terrible and it’s very very hot, you can’t survive placing your hand on a hot stove for 10 seconds, don’t even think you will withstand burning there without being consumed, The thing here is you will be burned without being consumed in hell the same same way you boil a hard rock in water you will be there for eternity, Again after judgement you will be thrown in lake of fire forever. Matthew 13:50 (UKJV) “And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.”   Realise that you deserve hell for your sins;  Romans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH. In Genesis 2:17 God warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit. They disobeyed God, but didn't DIE physically until hundreds of years later. Why? It's because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12). Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are not the same. Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead. The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15). All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that Jesus Christ got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at The Great White Throne of Judgment and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever.   So how to get salvation and be on your way to heaven?  First thing first; Believing at Jesus Christ does not involve worship of other gods(church leader&ancestors), object(hand bands,car stickers,trees e.t.c) Muhammad,buddha e.t.c. It's only believing at Christ as the perfect sacrifice for your sins. It's your choice but know that rejecting Jesus Christ will send you the wrong direction.  Hebrews 10:4, 10 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.   Any other form of sacrifice be it animal sacrifices it can't save you but we are only saved through the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ.  No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus Christ did for you as simple as that.   Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  Believe and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and was buried but risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now, that way you will receive salvation and be on your way to heaven during rapture or after death.  After believing at Jesus Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.  Romans 6:6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.  As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life.  Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag..
This song need to get some fame.. it's so good!!!
THIS IS ART! ✨
I think I'm in love with your voice Ingrid
Esta canción es ARTE, qué onda con los 198 deslikes, todo bien en casa, #8entendencia lo logramos gente ✨

I can't hold my breath. Zayn's voice is beyond everything
i love this so much
3:25 harmozing👆😭👌
I'm here for both Ingrid and Zayn. Cause I've loved ingrid since 2012 and Zayn since he was in 1D. What a dream came true to have them in 1 song. I'm crying
This song made me tear up I LOVE IT
I’m crying his voice is just fucking amazing omg I love this song
literally so beautiful im crying
I love this song💛
I love You Zayn
Zayn te amooo
zayns voice is so beautiful
zayns voice is  heavenly
their voices are perfect together
3:02 - 3:07 OMG
POV: escuchar la voz de Zayn me da mil años de vida, es una de las razones por las cuales vivo. ❤️
QUE OBRA PRIMA🛐🛐
01:19 zayn omg 🥰
Zj Famus BEATS WAS HERE🔥🌎
Zayn, tu é perfeito. Só tenho isso pra dizer msm
Gorgeous! Always great to hear new Ingrid music!
*normalicemos amar a zayn mas que a tu familia*
This song, cut me deep. Zayn& Ingrid is the collab I didn’t know I needed. Stellar vocals.🔥🔥🔥❤️
Zayn, you don’t need a Grammy to name you one of the greatest artist ever to exist. You have each and one of us that remind you every other day of the incredible human being you are. This just proves it even more.
amoooooooooooo amoooo amooooo
This is how many people love and will always support Zayn 👇
when zayn malik said "it's alright and it's okey" then I know I'll be alright
This song deserves more views.
i'm not fucking ok
So I love the fact that Zayn is collaborating with underrated artists , like he doesn't search for attention or fame , he is encouraging them to believe on their talent! Zayn chose mostly underrated artists to collab bc he knows that they are talented. I mean THE BOY COULD  COLLAB WITH ALMOST EVERY FAMOUS ARTIST ON THIS PLANET and can create masterpieces ( he is still creating masterpieces tho) but he chose to support a new singer, knowing that he can do something good for someone he believes in. For Zayn it’s always quality over quantity any day. That's what you call a true artist.🌹❤
Cantan hermosos los dos son arte
te amo
❤️❤️❤️
Zayn have his own version about music..
THIS SO SONG IS SOOOO GOOD AND VBE,TOO
GOD DAMNNNN this is like heaven in my ears rn
Dios mío
Zayn hits so different...
Beautiful
Everyone is talking about Zayn, but Ingrid Michaelson is always the queen of my heart with her incredible talent and voice!!!
La voz de Zayn haciendo dueto junto a Ingrid es lo mejor
Es arte
Nice song omg. Congrats zayn!
https://youtu.be/qfVuRQX0ydQ
La ame😥❤
John 3:16-17 16- For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17- For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23- For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
This is it. My new favorite song
No estoy llorando solo se me ha metido ✨to begin again✨ En el ojo

Me encanta
But if it was Harry it would blow up 😤
Zayn’s voice is so delicate and beautiful, really love his adlibs especially near the end of the song. Ingrid’s voice is beautiful as well
Pround of You ❤️

Quienes están llorando? 😭Zayn te AMOOO
I can definitely imagine hearing this in one of the future Animated films 🔥
2019: SHAED X ZAYN  2021: INGRID X ZAYN  I love when Zayn is doing that type of songs 🥰
When youre feeling down and you listen to Zayn singing "It's alright, Its okay" this feels good really
I'm glad they released this song the time when I need it the most. I love this song!!
Can we focus on Ingrid and not zayn...
how do you pronounce it, “heaven” or “zayn’s voice”?
MEU DEUS DO CEU QUE VOZES SÃO ESSAS, É ISSO QUE VOCDE ESCUTA QUANDO VAI PRO CÉU???????????
Proud of you 🥺❤
Zayn te amo😩🛐
I love Zayn soo much this is a good song, good god you guys I am all here for it love you guys <3
This song is all that's right...
https://youtu.be/viC07HosfUk
Ingrid is so talented. I am afraid she has become McIngrid the last couple of years.  All the right elements, pretty......but the soul is missing.
😭💙
Ya Allah suara Zayn terngiang-ngiang

Mi hija tenía razón tremenda voz la de Zayn 🥺bueno los dos tienen una tremenda voz🥺
Okay Zayn has a nice voice, but who is here for Ingrid Michaelson?
Unfortunately everyone besides Harry is underrated is so sad I Think that they are all special and talented and deserve better. So sad that only one member achieve something and rest of them didn't  I love Harry but also love those guys everyone from 1 d they are all special not only Harry
Zayn is love ❤❤❤❤🤞🔥🔥🔥
Esta canción es Arte 💖💖

This is one of the beautiful song ever, by the way why does this song sound like a lalabye

Diooooosss, es la canción más bonita, AaAaAa ❤️
Zayns voiceeee

La voz de Zayn es taaaaaan >>>>>>>>>>>>
Aí meu rim
ZAYN high note at👍👍👍 2:50 Omg we are gonna to die 😯
Beautiful song ❤
Ingid if you read this your voice is soooo good!♥️♥️
Zayn still deserves more hype !!
pongan cosas de ella también si al final es su cancion y z el ft sjjs
Arte para nuestros oidossss😻😻😻
IM SO SO HAPPY FOR HARRY THAT HE GOT A GRAMMY...but I heard that Zayns song trampoline was suggested at was high on charts but they didn’t put it in the nominees. Also dynamite is way better than rain on me and dynamite got more attention so idk how tf Ariana won. She’s a great artist for many songs but dynamite is way better than rain on me and I bet it got voted the most as well. This is just racism. Like tf ? these artists work there asses of and get no attention
THIS SONG IS SO FUCKING GOOD
Zayn tu voz es irreal
Ella canta hermoso, pero Zayn es un Dios. 😍
Highnotes!😭😍❤💕
I am considering checking this Zayn guy out. Been an Ingrid fan for 15+ years. So nice of her to support a young artist like this youngin Zayn. 😂😉
So, you just did your version of "If The World Was Ending" ? even the same piano bruh
Plz hold on  spotify ..💚💚💚            ŹÁŸÑ ❣️❣️❣️❣️
I love Zayn's high notes more than my life
THIS COLLAB IS ALL I NEEDED ❤🙏
WE LOVE YOU ZAYN X
What a masterpiece
Ah zayn üzümlü kekim
this song makes me feel like my soul has been complete
zayn you never fail to impress me and ingrid you sound amaze as well but zayns high note 😩🖐🏻

ARTE
ngl i actually cried while listening to this masterpiece (´；ω；｀)
FUN FACT : I LOVE THIS
Zayn ft. Billie elish 😍 please
le falta mas reconocimiento
Woooo, so cute
Really fuc*** the grammy! 👊🏻
This is an amazing song! Kudos to both artists. Am I the only one who thinks it's a great song for a campaign or sth? The meaning is so hopeful
I’m so excited to cry to this in the early hours of the morning
ARTE 🤩
This song is like a healing anthem 🥲
💘
1:21 thank me later😊
La existencia de Zayn mejora mi vida
Esas voces de angeles me dan las ganas de vivir otro día 💛✨✨
Great voices ❤️
Amazing song
I can't stop crying
Wooow
música boa da porra 🇧🇷
No dragging the names of artists who live peacefully and do their passion the way they want it. You are just simply generating hate with your actions wherein your fave artist most likely to suffer.
wowww,beautiful lyrics and 2 amazing voices...love this song
I don't care what you think but zayn DESERVES a Grammy.
casi me da algo lpm, zayn te amo.
This song is a ✨masterpiece✨ I’ve been blessed with zayns high notes once again 💃🏽
Normalicemos amar la voz de Zayn más que a nosotros mismos
✨ PERFECT ✨
I need a video clip😍😍
deveria estar sendo exposto no Louvre!!!!
this song has brought some inner peace in me during this pandemic. thank you ingrid and zayn.
💛
Zayn’s voice is A N G E L I C
Me sentí bendecida
I wanna a mv of this song it will be amazing
Just to be clear: Ingrid wrote this song and Zayn only added his voice to it. If you don’t believe me look at her Instagram and look at her post from January 7th. Also, Ingrid is not a new artist. She’s been around since 2008.
a unica coisa ruim é que a música acaba
meu deus eu to tremendo
te amo Zayn hazme diez hijos
boa a song, nem comecei a escutar ainda mas é boa a song 😭😭
Just people with good taste in music is here.
this song is beautiful , i cried
This song is so angelic and freaking perfect ❤️
literaly This song is THIS SONG
I imagine this song an ending for the fault in our stars movie :)
omg this is amazing
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT INGRIDS VOICE? LIKE HELLO? INCREDIBLE
Somehow this feels like the perfect song to play after the lockdown shit is finally over!
Ok i think i falling inlove
This is so good omg
SOOO GOOD
Estoy tan feliz de que zayn viva al mismo tiempo que yo
I'm crying.... And absolutely NOT in a cool way....
To begin again: "... And we talked about the places we'd never been" Walking in the wind: "... You will find me, in places that we've never been"  Don't touch me, estoy sensible:'(
LMAO EVERYONE THINKING THIS IS ZAYNS SONG WHEN INGRID WROTE THIS FIRST LMAO
I know y’all already know buuuut: THIS SONG IS SO GOOD OMFG THE LYRICS ARE JAGSSUTWURUEHWJ
I JUST LISTENED TO THIS AT 4 AM IN MY COUNTRY AND IM SOBBINGG ZAYN AND INGRID MADE A MASTERPIECE! WATCH ME PLAY THIS EVERYDAY IN MY ONLINE CLASS 😭😭😭
It has that "Ingrid" touch to it. I love it.
AMO LA VOZ DE ZAYN,  DIOS ES LO MÁS PERFECTO QUE EXISTE
Está canción y Zayn son A.R.T.E
Normalicemos querer más a zayn que a nuestra familia
UNPOPULAR OPINION: INGRID MICHAELSON IS TRULY INCREDIBLE. ALSO NOTICE HOW SHE ALREADY HAD THIS SONG OUT AND ALL YALL ZAYN FANS SHOWED UP
Crying T_T
This song is master piece❤️i like those singers who don't care about awards and make music for their fans. Zayn is one of those and the other one is Lauren Jauregui they both are super talented but super underrated. I don't get it when songs like yummy nominated for multiple awards and songs like these just disappear in those award categories🙄
What a piece of heaven
Zayns notes are higher than my grades
So beautiful song!!!
OMG the last Vocalizing or harmonizing By Zayn was so soothing.
Proud fans here😘😘😍😍
*Such a masterpiece!* ❤
We should try to begin again
İ cant stop listening  This fucking masterpiece

oh my god

this is so pretty i started crying
Sus timbres de voz combinan muy bien lptm MIS OÍDOS FUERON BENDECIDOS
Making fake scenarios in my head as if he is singing this for the boys! Just me? Oh okay!!🥺☹️
WOW
The fact that Harry Styles won Grammy and The Weeknd didn't even get nominated proves Zayn's point that it's all about "handshake" and "behind-the-scenes meetings"  P.S.: I'm not trying to convey that Harry is a bad singer but other artists who are more talented (in my opinion) didn't even get acknowledged
Absolutely breathtaking! ! ! !
wow this really looks a lot like my new comfort song
holy shit- this is absolutely beautiful 😩😀
Ingrid's voice is absolutely angelic!! their voices fit together really well too
I fucking love this song
I’m crying that’s so f* good

Zayn doesn't want to sing with famous one's he want to sing with talented one's.

*Zayn starts singing* Me : ಥ‿ಥ ❤️
The fact that Zayn can actually and finally be himself and do what he wants and be the artist he always dreamed of being makes me so proud of him and how far he came. He is such an amazing artist and human being. You can only look and listen to him and be so happy for him.
I Want this to be my funeral song 🥺❤️!!

There's no fucking artist like Zayn.. Being that good he isn't running for fame and money.. He just loves to make music and delivers to his fans.. He isn't not in all the drama to promote his music.. He just is in for Pure Art and Peace!

Its sad that grammy missed the Golden opportunity to get zayn on their stage and to get a blessing from him! Anyways this is bomb😭💓♾
Zayn and Ingrid have so kindly, gently put what I needed to hear in a beautiful melody. I've been so numb the whole of last year, sitting in a perpetual fear of the world ending, having seen so many deaths around me and yet wanting to hold onto life so tightly. It's so surreal to wake up everyday and walk and talk as if the last year hasn't altered me completely. As if it hasn't taken parts of my soul and crushed and broke them into pieces. I've never before felt so powerless, helpless and empty as if nothing I did mattered. It's so hard to go through life with this feeling sitting in your chest and now that things are finally looking up a little bit (I actually have started seeing children come out of their homes and play owing to the summer break), I do not know how to go back, how to fix myself, I don't know which broken piece fits where. I've been going on like this for so long, numb and empty and just disinterested about life. Maybe because I've been altered and transformed, perhaps the pieces really don't go back at all. Perhaps, I have to build it all over again, from the beginning. Discover myself all over again. What matters to me now? I have to push myself to love, love, love and live and dream and be excited about life as long as it takes to make it feel a natural feeling in my body again. 'And cry because I'm happy.' It's not over. We will get another day to try to begin again. Try being the keyword. Thank you for this beautiful song, Zayn and Ingrid. I'm thankful to you for talking about something a lot of people desperately needed. It's not over, people. We can try to begin again. ❤️
I love your music! They are played on Grey's Anatomy very often.
This is magic! Each word,each tone and these two beautiful sounds of two beautiful humans! 🥺😭🌍♥️

Te amo pinche Zayn, pisame la cara y te pago🥰
#ToBeginAgain I was listening to the song for the 1st time, my tears running down to my cheeks without I realized it. I didn't plan to cry today.  The song touched a part of my heart where deep inside I was struggle to keep myself feel alive. I hid the other side of me most of the timeThe other side of me where I'm emotional, sad, fragile, etc. I rarely showed it to anyone including my family. So that's maybe the reason I'm crying while listen to especially zayn part "it's alright it's okay" & part where "and it's alright it's okay we will get it another day to begin again (3x) i don't know how I don't know why but I know that I will try again"  To ingrid, zayn & all the team, thank you for ease a bit of the burden I feel this whole time.
LA VOZ DE ZAYN DIOS LES ESCRIBO DESDE EL PISO
Ingrid! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Amo esa canción con cada latido de mi corazón
ANOTHER MASTERPIECE BY ZAYN KING, WE LOVE TO SEE IT
I was really having a hard day.. but thank you soooo much for giving me hope to begin again.  I never had my exams this bad and i was feeling soooooo sad but I'm feeling really much better💛 Thanks Zayn
ZAYN TE AMOO
ingrid and zayn made a masterpiece, their voices are perfect.

If Trampoline and Moral of the story had a baby, this is what it'd sound like
perfect <3
Can’t breathe:)
This song is so beautiful, I love every single aspect of this song.
This is the zayn I want!!!!!!!
KING!
I haven’t already listen it yet but I could say that your voices together are powerful.  Some parts of the song reminds me of beauty and the beast.
Unpopoular opinion: WHY INGRID VOICE MAKE ME CRY
This song is so heart touching!!
incredible Zayn ❤❤❤

this song is literally free therapy
What a combo!!
im at hospital

Amo esta canción
A R T E
Qualquer coisa fica linda na voz do Zayn meu Deus, esse homem não tem um defeito
Thank you, Ingrid!
Unpopular opinion: this collab is so underrated
This song auto played for me and I was like "I haven't heard this song and I know that's Ingrid's voice".... NEW MUSIC! It's so good and Zayn sounds great on this as well! 😱
I cry because I am happy? of course bestie. Zayn your voice comes from an angel in heaven babe
Parei de respirar pra dar oxogênio pro rei e a rainha aqui
Las 58 personas que le dieron dislike no necesitan un psicólogo...necesitan 20
two of my favorite artists i never expected to even collaborate are right here making me cry over a song i never knew i needed!
their voices sound amazing together, one of zayn's best collabs ever <3
OMG this is a very relaxing song with a very angelic voices
My heart🥺🥺😍❤️

c'mon now this isn't ur first time being here

Zayn high notes  Love you

I'M OBSESSED
This song feels like therapy
Real shit fact: Other artists:I want to collabe with other famous artists to increase my  fame . #Zayn:I just want to promote real talent ♥️🙏
This song makes me want to live and begin again😭❤️❤️
And the award goes: "to whoever can write or spend money creating a video of a filthy, nasty , explicitly vulgar song ". I'm not sure what category this song should fall into, but is beautiful, flawless. It unifies and makes you want to hug friends and family you haven't seen awhile and cry.
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺❕
I hate it so much that Zayn is so underrated 😔
Please 😍😍😍

Zayn Malik - The definition of Artist. The falsettos that you sing ⭐ The  background runs that u make ⭐ The ranges that you go from high to low ⭐ There's no fucking artist like u zayn.

I need zayn and Ingrid to do a video song now🤧🤧
Track "Ingrid Michaelson" on Bandsintown When the world was ending I'd hold you in my arms And we talked about the places we'd never been  When the world was ending We'd hold on to the past 'Cause it's all we thought that we would ever see  But then sun came right back And the birds sang as if nothing had happened     And it's alright, it's okay We will get another day To begin again, to begin again, to begin again I don't know how, I don't know why  But I know that I will try To begin again, to begin again, to begin again To live and love and breathe again  When the world was ending We lookеd up at the sky And we talked about thе last song that we'd play  So far from comprehending They'd lift us to the stars Never seen each other from so far away  But then sun came right back And the kids played as if nothing had happened  And it's alright, it's okay We will get another day To begin again, to begin again, to begin again I don't know how, I don't know why  But I know that I will try To begin again, to begin again, to begin To live and love and breathe again  And cry because I'm happy And hold my friends like long lost lovers Be kind to me and love each other The world keeps spinning on     And it's alright, it's okay We will get another day (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)  I don't know how, I don't know when But I do know that we can try To begin again, to begin again, to begin To live and love and breathe again

Ingrid... WOW!!! You're an amazing lyricist!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
México aqui
to begin again❤❤
This makes my heart so happy! Years ago I said that I would love for these two to collab together in the future. Ingrid, I've been a fan of yours since your very 1st album. Also you helped me get through my college years with your angelic voice as I was cramming late night exams. Just pure all around magic. 🙌 Zayn, I've been a fan of yours since you and the group appeared on SNL. In fact, it was you who made me check them out. I immediately fell in love your voice and have followed you ever since. You're such an incredibly diverse artist with pure raw talent. Not everyone has that. So don't you ever forget it. 💖

ingrid voice😍😍 zayn voice😍😍
QUIEN CARAJOS LE DA DISLIKE A ESTA BELLEZA DIOSS AUN ESOTY LLORANDO
popular opinion: this song is going to be our new favourite
I WANT TO GET A TATTOO OF THIS SONG RIGHT NOW
Is it seriously just me but this song really reminds me of when Zayn sang the Aladdin song. Just the vibes and his voice is so calming yet sounds absolutely amazing.
This song kind of tells us about our feelings about the whole corona situation by saying 'when the world is ending' and the making of vaccine as ' the sun came right back' and our lives going kinda back to normal by 'the kids played like nothing had ever happened', it tells us that we should be grateful to each other now that we've experienced this by 'be kind to each other and love them'. It's really a masterpiece!
