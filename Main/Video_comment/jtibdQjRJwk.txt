I love you videos keep up the good work
Is back baby
The goat
Go back to the corner it is better for me 👍
Really good
Did u vs liverpool
It was better in the middle 😃
😁
6:28 he’s talking about the different placement of the GoPro before a freekick 😂😂
I don’t like the signal I think you should go back to the Corner
hi Ben i'm a Liverpool fan but i love your video's me and my brother watch them all the time
Hi Ben I'm a young keeper, only 14 years old, and am asking for any tips or tricks that I cud use. I personally think I am quite an alright keeper I have good handling position and aglity and just trying to build on that. I look up to u as my favourite keeper, all though I am a united supporter haha. Anyway back to my point I was just wondering if u had any tips or tricks as I am hoping to go pro or even get to a level of ability liek u. Thanks Ben
I like this channel because i like bikes and football
Sad to say but I’m a Liverpool fan but I love Watford because of you I will be at the Leicester game
This channel is so sick
Ben Foster you are the best.
I'm a liverpool supportur but u are such a good goalie
9:14 close you legs!
10:21
Great  channel really good
I’m from srilanka🇱🇰 and I just love this channel ❤️common the boys good job Ben
I like the angle in the middle
I love this so much do you rember me I am Joseph Chadwick you hold me when I was a baby
Absolute world class goalkeeper
You can't complain at eating pasta at 8:30 on what you earn mate
What is that referring
Any ben's collegue : hi u alright? Ben : TOP MAN RIGHT THERE
Good old bazlar
I am sorry Ben imagine your family was on The Line and you conceded an equaliser you’d be distraugh
What a leg
This is such a good channel like the beautiful pasta
Your pasta and chicken looks nice Ben
come On Ben I like you called Big Dog
lucky goal in the end … but well played
You are a legend
I’m low key addicted to these vids
Top bloke, great channel. Working from home made easier 🤜
Think you should go double go pro one so both positions covered. I prefer the new angle so you can see down the pitch and see the match more
I don’t really like we’re the go pro is pls can u go back to the old way pls thx Ben fox
Best channel ever from a PNE fan
Super channel Ben. Thanks youtube for recommending this.
Great sir , you are accepting your errors , it's a sign of a gentleman
i cant find a ben foster vid were he dosent scream jeremy
Terrible camera angle
That was clearly an offside the last minute goal so, how it is. foster gets the place of the defender and the defender gets the place of Foster so when the pass come to the opponent, the opponent was in front of foster so considering foster as a defender and the defender as foster its an offside, that’s the rule 11 btw
Was it really his error?
Good job
I left this channel for 10 seconds and I see this vid in my recommended and I couldn't not click on it and watch this beauty
Troy Deeney: scores a penalty  Ben: you little beauty
What boots he has on?
Was it 2 All or 1-1 Ben ?
its better in the middle of the goal
Need to cut out the background beat/music boys 👍
I want to be a goalkeeper now I have seen this
Hi Ben Foster My Dad Love your Channels
by next march ben needs to be at 1 mil subs plsss
Anyone know why he wipes his gloves on the grass? Plz tell me
At 9:44 does Ben say "2-all in the end"  ???.  What's that about Ben? 1-all surely !! .  BTW. Just came across Ben's Cycling GK channel and have been binge-watching it. Excellent stuff Ben. Its making me a bit of a Watford fan.
Ketchup with chicken and pasta. Wrong that 😂  Loving the content apart from that!
Can just tell how much of a genuinely nice guy he is just from saying morning to the chefs!! Love this guy
Love it keep it up ben
Great the way he shows us behind the scenes what a legend
ArchieRKO
that is a thing of beauty 😂😂 another class video
Spot on Borat expression at 2:49 :D
Commenting till I get Ben Forster no.1 signed shirt
In the corner
Will this continue if Watford get promoted
Binged watched this channel for the past 2hrs great content 👍
Great channel to wind down to. Really enjoy the behind the scenes
the angle is such a splendid upgrade ben! loving the content! <3
Every 1st goal he says u beauty
its not your error it is the defences fault because you ran out to get the ball
ben what glove brand do you wear?
I love the Chanel he even shows his mistakes and everyone makes mistakes Ben ur a class act in the goal keep it up  I look up to u and I’m only 9 trying to get into the blues academy because I’m on trial there
I’m a Bournemouth fan but this a great channel
That last minute challenge in the air! Absolute beauty!
ArchieRKO 👊🏻
I think on the corner is better I love the vids
Ben you are A good man
why are you so covering firs post so much?? (maybe my mistake cuz i cant see where the cross is coming from)  congrats on getting every cross righit on the game. goal was even a foulon you. big ups
Brilliant channel
Why u so good
Huge respect for you but this game being a 🍒fan was a big win for me
Great vid!
Good old bazaa. You little beauty
I am an arsenal fan but you are really good
My respect for ben everyime i watch these 📈📈📈📈
He’s definitely turned up all into watford fans
I love you Ben 1 of the best keepers in England and the world
I love this guy man
The new angle is better
SOOO Underrated
Is it a bad thing I’ve watched every video in a 3.5hr period
Ben I have to say, I don't think it's too bad if a mistake. Youve jumped up for it and hes bumped in to you so don't beat yourself up about it
Never thought I’d be addicted to watching Ben foster on a go pro 😂 love this channel.
Ben- every footballer loves an early kick off Also Ben: Every footballer loves a late kick off
In my opinion that wasn't an error you went to punch the ball you got unlucky with where it landed
Two all in the end??  What happens to the mountain of food that (I presume) goes uneaten after the pre match meals. Local foodbank?? Ps Great channel Pps Man United fan. Think you got a bit of a rough ride whilst there. Shame it didn't quite work out.
What an idea of a channel this was, was never a fan of Ben foster as a person until watching these, yet always knew he was a brilliant standard goalkeeper! Enjoy it
Ben you gunna get punished at Bournemouth!! (Great vids mate!)
love the vids man sick to be so close to the match
In all the videos you shout to isma😂😂😂
You can se more of the pitch but not goal
You love ketchup
Big leicester fan but I love the videos and content of this chanel
Love these videos as a former GK(in high school) myself. Another I love, is the weather haha.. absolutely beautiful!
ben foster your a little beauty ! lol
I like it
Сочувствую
this channel never dissapoints
Could you try putting the camera in the corner so it catches everything. Also love the channel keep up the good videos
Love football (West Ham) and love cycling (road and gravel) and now love this channel too. Great job Ben.
im a City of Liverpool Fan but loving the content
I love Watford are the best team in the world and so are you you’re the best goalkeeper for Watford🤘🏻🤘🏻💪🤙🤙🤙🤙
I love Watford are the best in the world and your best goalkeeper
Can’t get enough of this channel
Is anyone watching this and thinking the food looks so good
Favourite goalie in the championship mate. I am now a Watford fan because of you
I just started watching this channel, and i am amazed with how good this is @Ben Foster - The Cycling GK
who else really wants Watford to get promoted?
Fantastic and always entertaining sportsman
yes ben !
love the channel but camera back in the corner i think
The bromance between Ben and Baz is next level
Every Bosnian hearing him say Asmir   Begović was painful
All defenders should have the cyclists dead man look, always one over the shoulder, not ball watching.
Hello Ben any tips on goalkicks?! your was monstruous
Don’t like the angle
Love this Video
I honestly think he is still England's  best GK. Plus he loves cycling so that helps
Even tho I'm  Chelsea fan this channel Is great
Where's Kiko Kiko Kiko
im really suprisef u didnt get an england call up after the amazing saves u made last season were chelsea really interested?
Love the channel
Love this Ben
Saludos pa sierralta🇨🇱🇨🇱

Would loved to have seen these in the PL hope Watford go back up good club some top players

What’s the team bus like on the way back from a loss
Bro you are so good 😊
Great footage.  What about the prematch sports massage?  I am going to subscribe to your channel.  Best wishes.  👍
9:45 you said "two all in the end" but it finished 1-1 didn't it 😁

🐝
Best keeper in the world no doubt
I thought it was 1-1 not 2-2😂😂😂 9:15

Top keeper, love how he just shouts and tells his players what to do💪
Such a good channel ,I sat behind the goal once at Newcastle when you were in net
who the heck has pasta for breakfast i mean have some quakers dude
This is from a Newcastle fan can u try and pls do the whole 90 minutes if u can pls cos no other player does what u do and stay safe and try your hardest this season stay safe.
Hi Ben, I first saw you play live when you visited Malaysia with Man United. Good luck at Watford. You’ll be back up next season.
Fantastic stuff again Ben u lucky on result
I prefer the corner position
Too bad looks like efl is gonna ban his videos :(
I'm not even a Watford fan but this is class
By far the best goalkeeper In the championship. keep up the good work man ❤
you looked like you in control of an army when you walked at 5:50 -5:55 lol
Love this channel so much!! I used to be an amateur GK. I always wanted to see more of behind the scenes!! Foster, do you ever feel nervous or "pressure" in the first moments of a match?
I'm a Bournemouth fan and I enjoyed watching this he is so wholesome and I must say your are amazing keeps
I love the channel
Fozzy these vids are class. Even better when you're playing my club wwfc. Cmon you chairboys. 😉 Dont you have someone to clean your bikes 😂?
“That’s football” such a good quote
Love this channel
This is a good laugh the Chanel love to see BTS of a match and what goes on and it seems rlly interesting and seeing after the game and hearting the player it’s so cool. Keep up the good work Ben and yous will be promoted right back up 🙌🏻💛💛
I Prefer the Corner Angle, I'm a Sunday League Keeper, What Go Pro do you use and how do you fix it to the post? Cheers
I rlly hope he carries this on when we get fans back in stadium’s, would love to see a players perspective of a full stadium. Loving the channel ❤️👍
Love you a lot mate, last fifa u were unreal mate saved everything
Clearly model professional and quality goal keeper- interesting insight; would love to have played the game professionally but sadly no talent for that level 🤣 I’m a Saints fan- those 2 free kicks from James Ward-Prowse home and away you had no chance with- that defeat at St Mary’s was critical to both teams and massive win for us. Always had a soft spot for Watford- family club and good luck for the season. Love the channel !!!
Nice content, keep it up Ben!
Unlucky
Finally some goals 🐝🐝🐝
What hotel does the team stay in for home matches?
I'm a Bournemouth fan, unlucky Ben, love the channel. Keep it up
Legend
Manutd fan love this Chanel best about
Chapeau Ben, love your videos, especially the cycling content. As a Bournemouth supporter, was pleased to see that last minute equaliser, although not sure we deserved it but as you say ‘that’s football!’. Along with all football fans, looking forward to the day we’re all allowed back into stadiums. In the meantime keep up the good work fella and keep pedalling. 🚴🏽‍♂️⚽️🍺😎
Love the vids ben but ketchup on pasta?Have a word
How does he only have 100k subs, he should be in 7 digits with subs
Ben foster loving the videos and behind the scenes 👍🏻  You should link up with con okeefe (keeping goals vlogs)
just found the channel through this video, great content i like how its edited! which more footballers did vlogs like these so we can get more of an inside view!
Go on Ben, coyb 🔵⚪🔵⚪
Loving this channel me, keep it up man
Huge anouncement guys. According to FPL rules, Ben may be urged to delete these videos as they show snippets of the game and apparently this is not ok with the rules.  https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/18830929.watfords-ben-foster-may-remove-youtube-videos-due-efl-regulations/
Foster.  and. Allan
Foster  and allen
Foster and alan
Still loving these videos! Team moral needs to step up started well and now had a few dodgy games! Up the Hornets!
If Foster had gone down after those players went for the ball and knocked into him, would he have been given a free kick?
I remember that one time when I watched and Ben foster kicked the ball over the stadium
This channel is amazing
i like t90😍😍
Quality channel absolutely love the content
can you give some tips on goalkeeping techniques in a separete video?
Found out about this channel from fantasy 606 podcast and have a feeling it’ll become one of my favourites top video
Watching you makes me happy you beat us 1-0 Cos id feel bad if we won lol UTB
Ben, love these videos mate! Miss being in the stadiums so much but these videos make it less painful, also gives a nice perspective different from watching on TV. Always been a big fan of yours keep up the good work! From a Manchester City fan (booooo)
A beast on the field and a complete gentleman off it .love your content.
saw a reddit post that you might have to remove your videos because of EFL rules :( hopefully you can sort things out with them and keep posting videos like these
I think the previous angle is better because it shows all the area of the goal with the two posts  This cam only shows 60% of the goal so u need to adjust it so it shows all or get back to the old one
Great Channel Ben, loved watching your Cheddar Gorge ride. I’m a Barnsley fan so hoping for 3points on sat🤣🤣, make sure you post from Sat game at Oakwell. Top Guy 👍from Rhys BARNSLEY FAN
Just saying I watch Watford on telly and in his net I just see a little go pro😂
Camera angle was great but couldn’t see the far post but still great video.(great for young keepers to watch)
First thing I did when I watched this game on sky was look for the go pro 😂😂
Love this channel too much
Unlucky ben its football u did ur best but I got a question what's the best stadium u played in your a legend.
🍒
Hi I think your a brilliant keeper
im a gk but i hate coseding in the last min its soo annyoing keep it up cmon the honets
Now a Watford "fan" because of Cycling GK. can't wait to come and see a game live. amazing content.
Love this channel. Seems a cracking guy and is still a fantastic keeper. Top content
Much much better in the corner of the net.
Just saw his channel and i am kinda obsessed
I EXCITE 😂
What if you put it top right corner?
What a YouTube legend !!
I’ve been a fan of Ben ever since he was at west brom, what a great goalie he is . I’m soo grateful he made this channel , it’s my new favorite channel!
Wear a scrum cap and stick a camera in it? 😁
Love the encouragement given to the back four constantly. Must fill them with confidence! Love it Ben!
I think this is the first time I can remember seeing a reaction of letting a goal in which I really like. Shows the passion
Big fan of this account. Love the wide lens aswell
Contender for best footballer channel on Youtube? I think yes
This channel is incredible
9:47 wasnt it 1-1?
i think the new lens gives us a wider and better look at the pitch and all the action
love this channel. always admired you as a goalkeeper and cant wait to see watford back in the premier league
Imagine being in goals and thinking you conceded 2 after the match
Superb channel Ben, keep It up! Love from Sweden🇸🇪
Problem with this angle is that the sky is the focus if you had any way to lift the go pro and angle it right this angle would be so amazing
Man are ur t90 boots old or new?  My favourite boots ever!
"YES THEN BOYS"
UP THE CHERRIES💪🍒
Only just subscribed to this. As a keeper this is great. As a football fan it's better. I'm a Boro fan, but have always had a soft spot for Watford. (Happy family memory involving football manager!)  Just do me a favour Ben and dont ever move to Chelsea, Leeds or Sunderland.🤣🤣
Proper gutting - Kelly should have been off. You seem to command from the goal - keep it up!
that was lucky goal
Keep it like this Ben view is better. Also loving this content ❤️
I am glad that ben foster takes the knee good man
Ben didnt u use to play for a warwickshire football team when u first started
This channel will open up more possibilities for others...great job
Great Channel. He seems like a real stand up guy. Keep the good content coming. Maybe interview some of the other players
Quality one again Ben, reckon the centre is class. Maybe stick a bit of the warm ups in
cant stop watching these vids, humble bloke at the top level. Hopefully see you in the prem next season🙌
Unlucky Ben, keep up the good work
Unlucky mate
Love the passion mate
I’m a Bournemouth fan but I just can’t stop watching this channel love the content it’s so addicting
Better keep it going even when fans r back ! Love this channellll !
Love it
This is the reason why I love footie
Keep your head up high lad, it's football, such an inspiring person, love the vids keep it up
prefer other angle
Imagine filming a YouTube vid during a match
Such an underrated keeper🙌🏻
Love the channel, it's a great way for the fans to get a glimpse behind the curtains! Something i think would be cool, is if you'd be able to edit in the goals that's scored during the match, seen from the TV point of view. It's just a thought, though. Other than that, great videos and please keep them coming!
Great video, but I prefer the corner angle, can see the goal posts, think it makes for a better pod. Either way, won't stop watching. Cheers!
Your view is better than the one in the corner
I feel like this angle is better tbh, and I feel like u should also do Q&A’s as well like once a week this could be about being a keeper or wat not ?
Love your videos mate! Legend!
Top man & top goalkeeper 👍
hey mate not a big fan of the camera        im subbed        pls shoutout
Can not hang the GoPro from the tops net maybe? 🤔
You put ketchup on your pasta?! That's a crime against basic human decency..
Keep up the good work, class channel man👍🏻
This is genuinely my favourite YouTube channel atm, such a genius idea mate! Love it.
I showed my friend this and he is already subscribed    Ben you legend keep it up
Un grande ben foster jaja un saludo desde jalisco Nueva generación
Who else seen his go pro on sky sports highlights?
hi ben i love your channel i hope you give a subtitle for a video sorry for my bad english because im not a british
Another cracking video Fozzy! Shame about the equaliser although still a solid performance. You nearly had me at the end saying it finished 2 all!
2-2🤔
Best channel idea ever, I'm not even a Watford fan. Also goes to show how much of a mad bastard you have to be when you're a GK. I get anxious just watching this from this angle never mind if i was a player. Really enjoy the camera angle too, but I like both so i couldn't say. Felt i could see more of the game from this angle personally.
You didn’t smash the cross bar when the start whistle went😳
Legend Ben. You could make them longer they fly over. How has no opposition player ran over to the camera when they have scored and said 'Stick that on your Youtube channel' though?
The ball literally disappear in the clouds at 4:38 ahahahah
Fantastic channel 👍😀 love seeing the go-pro action an seeing a top pro  at work. Keep the the video's coming Ben love from Ireland ⚽🙌
“Little Beauty!”  Favourite part of the vids Great vids Ben, keep up the good work
hey ben, been trying to meet you for years, I have followed you from Manchester United to Birmingham to West Brom. and now you are at Watford and I'm still yet to meet you, I am gutted been trying to get your autograph for years.
Great video again Ben. Love it
Absolutely loving this. You can’t not love this guy. Keep it going 👍👍👍
Unlucky with the goal,Ben Foster
Tips vid????
love these
Keep centre Cam
Love this channel, BF.  Let's see another clean sheet tonight.
Another great video Ben! When you said that you get butterflies when getting onto the coach, you sure that’s not just the coffee kicking in? 😂
It would be nice to see post to post but I do like the center view.
This is now my favourite YouTube channel
Essential viewing! That last minute goal was a real kick in the guts. Let's put it right tonight, although the performances are already there. Oh and after I recover properly from Covid-19 I am going to find you on Zwift Ben and make you suffer in a race!! 😜
love the sky. guess it was cold hahaha
New subscriber and a arsenal fan but loving this channel 👊🏻
Can you make a video showing your pre match routine and warm up at the stadium?
Great video again Ben 👍 think try the new camera angle in the corner next game. Are you allowed to film training? Would be interesting to see what sort of goalkeeping drills you do etc
He’s such a sound guy!
Hi Ben, just trying to reach out to you to pull together a congrats Video for Tao, i know he is a big fan and having something from you would be incredible, please check you DM
Loving these in goal videos, using them as a tool for the GKs I coach, great examples of communication and organisation
This is the sort of thing I'd of loved as a kid. Hearing how you communicate with your defenders, loud, clear and simple instructions. Positioning, timings for crosses etc.. This is great insight for any aspiring GK.   I'm glad you enjoy making these and as a GK myself I love getting a slightly different perspective of the game and how top GKs conduct themselves on and off the pitch.   I really hope you keep this up Ben.
Been here since 4k subs
Thanks for showing our equaliser from your perspective Ben. That’s a great lens- Top video channel, keep it up mate. “Just talk waffle & smile,” great comment!
Ben, any chance of a full rendition this time  of Dave and burner boy, Location? Haha👀😂
mate your trending world wide
Please promise us you will be continuing to make these videos after the pandemic......please please please please
Ben, I may not be a Watford fan but I felt your pain after that last minute equaliser. Love ur channel btw
Amazing channel Ben. Loving the thumbs up at the espresso machine. "What a sicko".
Love how vocal you are in games, not letting the defense get away with anything. Unluck game for you guys will be good to seeing Watford back in the prem next season.
My new favorite channel.
just started watching this channel.. played footy for most of my life..it's fantastic to see the footage.. my brother was a footballer and him and all his workmates where the same..shows that most footballers are just normal blokes who are good at the sport.. what i love most is the attitude of Ben.. totally positive especially during the game.. there's nothing more special than playing footy with blokes who play this way and encourage you to do your best .. God bless Ben Foster..🙏👏✋
Is anyone here from Soccer Am Pro Am...they talked about this channel and I came and subbed..well done ben
This channel is amazing
Always love your vid mate!
Top man, top goalkeeper, top channel.
Honestly such an entertaining series. This just makes me want Bernd Leno to start vlogging stuff as well not gonna lie.
Hey I’ve been trying to get a pair of gloves for the past 4 years from you as I collect them I’ve got over 100 pairs atm please can I have a pair of yours if you got some spare please x
Do you ever find that filming your own gameplay can be distracting? I tried it myself during my season and I've never had two worse halves of football. I think subconsciously I'm distracted by it. how do you break that barrier? Love the content Ben, keep it up!
I'm Tottenham fan but this channel is really good and inspire me
Sick channel Ben one of my fave keepers!
Probably one of the best channels I’ve come across in a while. Keep ‘em coming, from an Arsenal fan.
How long do you think you are gonna carry on playing for????
I’m really enjoying this channel!! And about the GoPro, I’d prefere to continue watching from Back corner!🤙🏽
Some tomato ketchup broo that’s fkin a shit ton
“You little beauty”   😂👌🏽👌🏽
Mate this is honestly by far fav channel on YouTube don’t think people realise how interesting it is to see inside footballers life. Never mind a keeper! It’s funny when you watch that goal back too you could see little things that could of easily prevented it.
Great work Ben! As a fellow GK I think what you are doing is super cool man. Love it! Keep them coming. Also, could it be possible maybe to record some gk training sessions? Watching you all the way from MALTA #gkunion
A Liverpool fan but this is my fav channel on yt absolutely top class been watching you in net since I was kid can’t remember a time without you  What a king 🤘
Loving the content Ben. Highlight of the week when your videos drop. 👍
I love just wacthing every game seeing ur go pro then getting excited for this video
Massive fan of you and the videos. But, a huge club like Watford still on the single use plastics with the coffee machine. You can sort it out, Ben.
Camera angle was good, was good to see the other side of the goal more clearly and to see what fully happens, I wonder if your able to strap your GoPro to the corner of the goal or on the post at the back which holds the goal... just an idea 🤣 but still, love your vids, you’ve defo gone to the top of my list of my favourite Youtubers, keep up with the class keeping and vids!
The camera angle is perfect Ben
I would like the wide angle to be a bit further back, or a bit wider even  Just want to be able to see both posts
go back to corner my opinion
What would you do if you get sent off? Go and grab your go pro and take it with you before you leave the pitch?
Those t90 boots. Good old days ❤️
I would consider using the old lense, due to the fact that most of the goal was covered. This current lense doesn't really capture the entire net, hence my opinion about the original lense.
Go Pro... Go Ben 👏
old angle is better in my opinion great vid!!!!!!!!
Great channel Ben keep it up.
Still love you Ben from a wba fan
Bang go pro on cable tie on tie backs poles near top then you can see the play aswell 👍👊
Another top video- great insight to what goes on
How much do you earn being a goalkeeper?
Did you announce the shirt giveaway
This is so interesting
Hello foster loving the videos as a Coventry city academy and I would love to see the other camera ,any tips and good luck from tommorow
I'm a west ham fan and I love this channel. The vibes are crazy good. keep up the good work Ben with the form your in gonna get ya promoted 👍
Class again
How did I not know he was left footed
Wide Lenses are better . Love behind the scenes footage. You do love your tomato sauce lol
Love the build up etc great channel Ben to see the in depth look at other things as well as the game
old angle pls
Great to get the insight before and after games!
please ben keep up the amazing videos, they are simply beautiful to get an insight of your life as a professional football player
This position is very good i like it
These videos are sooo entertaining,  cheers from Egypt mate 🇪🇬
Prefer the old angle mate but love it
Could I recommend the s1 goalkeeper gloves or one glove they are very good
Would love the shirt :)
Not even a wolves fan but just missing football and I’m loving this content also I did prefer the last go pro cam position but it ok keep up the hard work and I’m impressed with what wolves are doing this season tbh
This is a great channel, even though I'm not a Watford fan I was gutted when they equalised in the 95th minute. Wycombe seem to be the division's whipping boys but take nothing for granted.
When I was a little kid one of my favorite goalkeepers and things still haven't changed keep up the videos brudda ⚽
Amazing content Ben, love seeing the game from a keepers perspective, top pro, top bloke, top content. Class mate keep it up.
Ben could you give us a close look at your gloves and what modifications you have to them if any 👍 keep up the great work aswell
Cracking channel... I look forward to this more than watching Sunderland play... 👍🏼🙌🏼
Liking the channel, interesting the see the real like and routine of a pro footballer, would like to see more cycling content, do you get a chance to go on any big rides once the season has started? Does cycling ever impact your football? I think camera angle was better in the corner as you could see the whole of the goal
The new camera angle is not bad but i just personally prefer the old one
Ben I'm a huge fan of you you're my favourite keeper thoughts on Randolph as hes my national team keeper also watford are going up 💛⚽️
i prefer the go pro in the corner
Brilliant videos! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
SIERRALTA HOLDER !!!
Not even gonna lie mate, the last minute heartbreak cost me £700 quid on my acca but if you want to send me a pair of gloves to make up for it id appreciate it (of course I can provide proof) just joking pal love the content!
Yeah the wide angle lens is better mate. Keep it!
No way does the Watford goalkeeper do YouTube 😂😂

A point is better than none but Bournemouth should have had a couple sent off for some terrible challenges, thanks for another great video & roll on Tuesday. Enjoy your weekend. completely!
Great vid again Ben, ref had an absolute stinker
Absolutely loving the channel, videos are great   Centre goal wide angle is much better though
Great vid Ben 🐝🐝🐝 Annoying with the result but we move forward to tomorrow
Please keep doing theese type of videos
Love it Fozzie!!! Bloody brilliant channel!!!
That mentality!!!
hi Ben man united fan here great channel love the content . p.s keep an eye out for our jimmy for us (James Garner ) thanks
I from Malaysia .I subscribe you..l like you video..next month 100k sub.🥰
smack the cross bar before matches like in the previous vids. you didn't do that this match. maybe its a good luck thing?
I bought you on fifa 21
I watched this game live on TV and I noticed the camera in the goals.
I saw your camera on the highlights haha
Leamington Lad 💪👏
I watch every video comes out. Your an inspiration to me and always looking to become a better keeper and these videos help so much!
Love it foz keep them coming like the wide lense personally
Do you always sit in the same seat on the coach
Was going to comment on how I love seeing you come and catch crosses. Then I seen the goal :)
Keep doing what you doing Ben. Until one day, Amazon will come approach you.
love the channel and the new lense 😍❤️
Loving the channel and content, is it possible to get a peak of your match day warm up routine at some point? KRO
Just found this what a great channel well done Ben!!
Wide lens is Quality,and you see much More.From these Angles you can see just how fast the game is in real time,and a split second is all it takes.Look forward to the Wycome Video,and Thank you Fossie,Quality seeing this :-) Maybe you could sneak a Camera in the oppositions goal and see it from both ends ;-)
Other angle is better
Prefer this new wide lens for middle of the goal
Bournemouth fan here but your my favourite channel. I've been waiting to see this vid and I hope we both go up
Great content Ben.
Foster is the best youtuber no cap! Defo prefer the old camera angle in the goal
We won’t talk about the red cards 😶
Enjoyed that Ben (apart from the view of Muff's goal)
I'm a westbrom fan you did so well at the baggies miss you
Loving the videos Ben. As a goalkeeper myself it’s great to watch your positioning and talking.  I would say I think I preferred the camera in the corner so you catch the whole goal.  Keep it going pal 👍🏼
great videos Ben, keep em coming.
DO A HOUSE TOUR PLS!
Love that he is a confident and commanding goalie in the box, grabbing the crosses before opponent gets to the ball first. I hope Watford does well and gets promoted again to PL so that I can see Ben Foster play against his old club, Manchester United and I really want to see this Go Pro view from behind the goal for that match. Thanks, Foster, for sharing and hope you keep doing this as long as you can!
This channel is class. ~ from a Burton Albion fan
I remember watching you back around 2005-2007 for Man Utd reserves at Hyde United. Loving the videos, humble guy!
Keep up the good work
Awesome content, I really enjoy your videos. Good idea with the wide lens, but I think that we could see better when the camera was in the corner of the goal. Keep up the postivity, have a nice!
Love to see you get back in premier league next season ❤️❤️
Hero
2 all at the end? 1-1 Ben! Hahaha dont put yourself down to conceding two!
Love this tbf, miss being at games☹️
Love the videos mate, keep them up
Game finishes 1-1   Ben-game finished 2 all in the end
Unlucky result mate but I have to say, Really enjoying this channel, just have to say, I personally prefer the old camera as we see more of the goal. Perhaps you could put the wider camera behind the goal rather than in the goal. Regardless, I will keep watching this quality content!
Can you help me become a pro goalkeeper
Should try and put the camera in top corners maybe if allowdd
Anothet mint video, genuinely making me day when i get a email saying you've got a new upload haha. Ps started watching watford instead of Newcastle now!!! (can you blame me)
Great video mate loved it 👍
I think with the GoPro you put it in the middle of the goal is better. Because I can see what your position will be when you are ready to hold an upcoming ball.
Can you put the go pro back in the corners please
Is it possible to do some training drills, give us an incite to how to train and what drills you do
Loves these behind the scenes videos. Myself and my son are both keepers and its so much easier to make him understand what I do when a professional says and does similar things. Prefer the corner angle on the gopro as we see more of the goal. Keep up the good work, definitely my favourite chanel at the moment 👊
Think the wide angled lens is decent mate. Great content and thanks for doing this and giving us a great insight into football life.
Great channel Great keeper love it . Quick question ben who does the editing and what software do you use 🤗
Didn't smack the crossbar at the start that's why you lost ifykyk
Didn't smack the crossbar at the start that's why you lost ifykyk
This channel so sik love it
Ben Foster, providing help for keepers of all levels without even trying to. Legend!
Personally I prefer the go pro at the back right of the goals instead, you can see more of the action
Just watched every video in one sitting, Man Utd fan here, sad when you left mate. Love the vids!
Great video, keep it up and good luck for the season
You seem like a very nice, genuine guy🙌
Your so natural at this YouTube thing. Not gonna be supriced if you get into Sky Sports after your career!
I'd love if you could put a timestamp at each highlight.... Only if you have time Ben!!!
Me bieng here since 1k and now so many people it’s kinda sad but at the same time great
I like it when you put the GoPro in the middle it a better view.
Sick channel
I excite 😆😆
class video 🔥
"bournemouth, good team, they got relegated, we got relegated" lmao
Another great video! Love the new camera angle!
Santa's wife hit him on the head with the frying pan. Santa: What was that for? Santa's Wife: I found a paper in your pocket with the same BASANTI on it. Santa: I bet on a horse last week and BASANTI was the name of my horse. Santa's wife: Oho Sorry Next day she hit him with the frying pan again. Santa: now what happened? Santa's wife: your horse is on the phone.....
I know you peoples can answer this. . . . .What islands should have good singers?
2-2???😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
Excellent channel, thoroughly enjoying it. Great insights and love the enthusiasm.
someone get this man to a 100k subs!
I prefer the new go pro angle
Prefer the old angle not gonna lie but class keep it up man!
Love the channel Ben, thanks for getting us closer to the action while we all stuck in lockdown!
Such a underrated keeper, he's quality! Great footage!
Another top performance 🧤only conceded 3 in 6 keep it going we love it 🐝⚽️
LOVE IT!!!!!!!!
Another cracking video, think the corner angle is slightly better
I like pasta...I'm Italian...bye guy I like your channel
Best Youtuber out there nowadays. Another good channel I recommend to anyone is Ryan Babel and his vlogs
I like the wide angle, maybe get 2 gopros and edit between the 2?
ben foster is premeir leuage goal keeper not championship
Best Championship by far, love these videos!
I like Watford and Leicester
Being a bmth fan is class seeing us get an equaliser but Foster is class and I love watching these videos, great channel ❤️🙏🏼
Love you Ben was a good game shame they got that lucky goal! Come on you hornsss 🐝🐝🐝
Superb video as always mate. Thank you for putting out such fantastic content. In all honestly - old camera angle better fella. Could see the whole goal rather than just 85% of it this way
Unlucky result bro, dominated the game all the way through. Keep Up the vids, love watching them
Nosy question here pal - did you have to run these vids past the manager or have you just cracked on? Great insight into a pros match day love the vids 👍👍
Ben, I’m a Man Utd fan and Loving your content mate, keep it coming
Please absolutely smash Wycombe. Cheated their way into the league and clearly not good enough for this level
tbh this is like highlights but 360 and premium
Never seen 2 sets of walls for a freekick before, then he smashes it right into them haha very strange
Absolutely love the quality on this channel. Consistency is incredible aswell, go on the boys 💪🏽💪🏽
Use wide angle in the corner of the net I think! Onwards and upwards Ben, another good performance by yourself, unlucky about the last minute scramble in the box. Like you say these things happen bro
could you put a go pro on the crossbar?
How does he boot the ball so high
Hi Ben, my goalkeeper coach recommended your channel to me to help with my communications skills and it has really helped. You have also made me get into biking 🚴 👍
yes ben
Hi Ben. Bad luck on that equaliser. The old angle was better. Do you have any regrets about leaving united? Stay safe.
Great channel and love the content prefer the camera in the corner
painful to watch this video but has to be done for super ben 💛
Thanks Ben
I prefer the original go pro position
Love this Channel, brilliant insight into a Pro’s life
Love this channel too much
IMAGINE HAVING A TRAINING SESSION WITH HIM
I had to leave it a couple days as it would’ve been too raw to watch straight away 😂 great vid Ben onto the next game !
How do u kick so high and powerful pls tell.me sir
UTCIAD
Any chance of a signed West Brom shirt lol😉
Wait, that's not Heinz Tomato Ketchup on your Pasta and Chicken is it...Please say no
Heartbroken, but hey, unbeaten at the Vic! Just loving this season! Thanks for keeping us close to the action! 🙏👍
10 out of 10 again mate great video
Thoughts on hegazi leaving west brom? And great video loving the content at the moment
This genuinely has to be one of the best things I’ve watched in a while
Was 1-1 not 2-2 fozzy 😂 shame about the draw, and Bournemouth got lucky with Kelly still being on the pitch, but we go again!! Great stuff as per!!
Loving these Ben, great work fella
Something new and inventive on YouTube. We needed this channel! Thanks
Great vid, maybe try put the gopro at the top middle of the net? would that work?
Can’t make my mind up what I prefer both good, keep them coming love the videos
What a channel this is, unlucky we didn’t get the win against Bournemouth but anyway we’ll still get promoted ;)
Love this channel mate, it keeps me so entertained even from a result like this! Keep it up and good luck! COYHooorns 🐝
I’m a Liverpool fan but these videos are absolutely class lad keep it up 👍 really interesting mate 🤘🏻🤘🏻
This is amazing idea me being a keeper it helps me take tips on how I position myself and what to say to defenders incredible
i’m just laying down staring at the clouds
this channel should have been made some time ago !!!!! absolutely loving it
A footballer hearted my comment thanks Ben
This is brilliant to watch look forward to it every game
And great channel
Ben is it you that played for Manchester United or your brother
Would love it if Ben hearted or replied
My favorite channel ❤️
As a goaly myself these videos are great
I watched it on the TV and I told my dad, do you see that go pro there that is for Ben Fosters YouTube channel. He just said. I bet he’s amazing
Just put the camera like usually mate...love your video, make me feel like im the keeper...really nice. Big support from indonesia
Just come across your channel, absolutely loving these Ben. Nice to see what things are like behind the scenes especially without fans. Will definitely be keeping an eye on your results and continue watching. All the best x
I like it in the corner
JEREMEEH
i hope you get back to prem league and keep making these content
I swear I was waiting for your vid. Top guy, Top keeper. Giving the fans a new dimension
Get a couple of go pros and start doing a bit of editing.
Idk why it looks so good when keepers take goal kicks  But.., keep it up! This is a sick series
Road to 100k
So unfortunate  (Edit) The big man liked this comment himself? I’m honoured 😂😂🙌
PROPER YouTube channel this
Gutted for the result.  I think we would all love to win your Top though Ben 👊🏼❤
Ayy go on Ben love this, can tell you’re such a genuine nice guy too, really felt sorry when they got the equaliser
Ben,  1) was a bit dizzy watching the video because of the camera 2) thanks for putting the goalkick in the video.  Keep it up. Cheers
Ben I think there is a setting for a wide angle already on your go pro
Love the rawness of the go pro clips!!!
Bro can you put the go pro on your head?
Little Beautyyyy, Cam On
Best channel
Fantastic videos please keep them going Ben
I like the old one than the new one
Im not even a Watford fan but enjoying these
THIS CHANNEL IS LIKE THERAPY
Have to say I prefer the corner with the camera
Love your videos man keep up the good performances. can u show us all the goals even the ones u concede not late minute ?
This time last year I never would’ve thought I’d start following Watford because of a YouTube channel but then again, stranger things have happened this year
The angle is perfect! Keep it like that for your next video
Why do you rub your gloves on the ground?
prefer the camera in the corner then can see the whole goal just a heads up 🤙
Hey Ben, unlucky there. The angle was okay, but corner better, i think
Wahey 🤣
I’m a Bournemouth supporter Ben I think your channel is great keep them up, great to see a different angle of a football player.
This is mint. A great insight into a footballer's life and it's a Brucey Bonus that you're a cyclist too.
Man Utd fan - awesome channel Ben. Love the insight. Top man 👍
Ben foster is the nicest most genuine footballer I've ever seen
Good angle for me just can’t see the far right hand side area.
I like the new camera angle. Keep up the good work Ben!
Love ya channel pal....can't wait till you play Forest
Pls don't stop making this type of video when watsford gonna promoted.......I want to feel the atmosphere of premiere league and the crowd..BTW it's better to keep in the corner ....there we can see a bit then keeping it in the middle
Love the passion!!!
Imagine these videos with a full stadium... That will be awesome!
Brilliant channel Ben, keep going. Like the new camera angle by the way.
Wow. Nice. Unlucky in the game but at least the food looked nice.
I bless my Mate everyday recommending this channel to me :-) great content. Love it
I’m not a Watford fan but I think u are a brilliant goalkeeper and knows how to make content
Like the new angle such a fitting goal to concede late on. Roll on Tuesday away to Wycombe.
I never thought I would enjoy these kind of contents but turns out, I really loved it. Well earned subscribe, Ben. Let's go.
You can tell Ben just watched Borat 2 😂😂 2:50
loving these football video's mate keep them going, your doing a great job.
Awesome Content! Keep it up, mate!
Can’t wait for him to face akinfenwa
This was a good video for my son to watch. Took a tough loss the other day, but he saw how you dealt with the late goal and it taught him a good lesson. One of the classiest youtube channels.
4:37 oh... that goalkick is so exciting to watch
being a goalkeeper myself i just love watching these vids. keep on the good work mate cheers!
Ben foster is underrated
I prefer the GoPro in the corner because it is a bit hard to see the corners. If you are able to hang the GoPro in the top corner with the wide lens, that could also be another experimental angle
When the ball goes to the GoPro's corner, I always get so scared that the ball will hit me in the face.
🤙🏼first of the kind of vid’s bruv...
This channel is something else bru! First hand experience
Really have to say I enjoy getting this insight. Does Ben do the editing as well?
Personally preferred the other angle Ben. Still another great video though.
United fan from Singapore - absolutely love these videos!
Personally prefer the new camera angle! Ps, you said it was 2 all at the end of the vid mate
So Happy I discovered this channel. I never knew Foster was such a fun character. Love the content. As a Spurs fan he always seems to turn into prime Neuer against us haha.
Watford player: scores Ben: You little Beeuutty 😂
As a young goalkeeper these videos are both entertaining and useful. Absolutely amazing and hope you keep them up forever!
Love the new angle Ben we can watch the beautiful game even better I love the content keep it up ✊
I absolutely enjoyed watching this kind of series!!! Keep it going Ben!! You little beauty ;)))
Say hi Benn, I'm from Indonesian ❤️
You are amazing Foster. Really motivated me, the talk you gave at the end. Com’n you little beauty 👌
These videos are amazing, proper perked me up after a shit couple of days - stoke fan ❤️
Enjoying the content Ben :D
I'm really enjoying these videos, please don't stop putting them out. feel much closer to the action. can hear chit-chat between players during a game which is nice.😂
what is it you kept rubbing your hands in? on the floor
Stop kneeling ffs
I shock you didn’t put in the save you made from the shot on top of the box in the second half... And I like the corner angle better.. Great video though 👏🏾👏🏾
keep it up mate great work 🌟
You are the best goalkeeper in  the LeagueBen Foster
Love this! Your channel is keeping us entertained! Thank you Ben! ❤️👏🏼👏🏼
The best content creator
Much prefer the other lens.
Put the camera back in the corner
Loving the content ❤️❤️❤️
Keep it up, this is class!!!
This series is undeniably the best footballing channel out there.  Keep it up Ben
Most humble player I’ve ever seen coming from an arsenal fan I really rate this guy so highly
As a young keeper and seeing someone as experienced as this in real game situations is next level knowledge for us 🙌
I would prefer the GoPro at the previous position
Ben, these videos are great! Good luck for the season... camera in the centre is bang on!
I love your videos
I thought you made the right decision to come and claim the ball and the execution of the punch was actually really good considering you had contact with two other players. I think in this situation its the responsibility of the defenders to step up as soon as the ball is cleared out in order to put straggling strikers off side. Great game, unfortunate outcome.
Such a needed Youtuber and a great player. Hope he plays at Watford till his end of career👍👍 what a guy
Honestly my favourite channel at the moment keep up the great work and good luck for the rest of the season (not against swansea though) ;)
Definitely in the middle, interesting perspective into how much a keeper shouts, directs, encourages etc. Ps love your querky routines
Sorry about that Ben super unlucky but onto the next one
Wow great video. Glad YouTube recommended this. Keep up the great work/performance Ben!
Bournemouth fan here, but still absolutely loving this content, as a goalkeeper and as a football fan as well. Good luck for the rest of the season Ben!
I prefer the side angle video but these vids are still amazing
When you sit down to a Cycling GK video at the end of the day👌👌
Not a Watford fan but genuinely love this channel 👍
was looking for the go pro on the highlights !
This maybe in the future can get 1 milion subcriber and thank you ben foster for introduce how profesional player do it😁😁😁love this channel😘😘😘
This is excellent I look forward to your vids coming out
Hey ben, I’ve recently been looking to buy a new pair of protective goalkeeper gloves with good grip as i’m recovering from a broken finger, i like the idea of a hybrid cut but not 100% sure, do you have any ideas/suggestions for where or what gloves i could get? Cheers big fan of the channel, keep up the solid work 👍👍
This is the content we needed big man, for the camera i honestly prefer it on the corner as it have a better view but anyway keep it up and i hope to see you in a liverpool shirt anytime soon 💪🏻
Ben just have to say your one hell of a nice guy,I love your positive attitude.
Someone watched Borat!😂 "I excite!"😂
Great video again mate, big fan of the new camera angle.  Do you edit the videos yourself?
Wouldn’t be a vid without hearing “Jeremy” 😂
hi Ben, I'm a pompey fan but  now I look forward to seeing the watford result because of these videos, I'm a young goalkeeper myself and these videos inspire me to make myself better. love the content
I love this!
You are doing great work 👍
Corner is better angle
Truly an amazing insight, huge thanks Ben for making us easier to go through this difficult and unusual period of time, even if it's just for a few minutes 🙌
Never a game with out Ben foster slapping his gloves 😂😂
Im a chelsea fan yh but i like this series coz it brings you closer to what actually go’s on behind closed doors in the life of a footballer 😂
My 12 year old son sent me a link to this to tell me about the comms in the game.  Great for him to see how it works.  Also lovely insight into a day in the life of a pro.  Would love to see more cycling.  Or let us join a zwift session with you if we can keep up 😁
6:53 telling the lads they may have to take one is a touch of class - clearly aware that these outfielders can get a little nervy standing still like a goalpost, looking out for your teammates !
Audio quality is class on this
Still lovesssss this
Love both cameras tbf
Not even a Watford fan I support arsenal I'm only here because I'm a goalkeeper 😂
Bro this is soo good to see your POV
Love this channel mate. Keep up the good work, great content 👍
Nice vid hope u get promotion premier league but the problem is that u get bullied by wolves fans but dont get carried away
I've just discovered this channel and its awesome how we can actually see the pov of a professional footballer on a normal day.
Unlucky there Ben! The trials and tribulations as a goalkeeper in the last couple of games. Honestly love the channel, keep up the good work 👍🙂
I seriously enjoy watching these Ben! Great stuff keep it up 👏
For some reason when ever I watch the game live on hive live i always look for the go pro in our goal now😂
Best channel out there right now hands down
Love this mate!! Keep it up been watching since day n I’m from midland love it
Tough game against a good side. Come on you beauty!!! 😂😂😂
Daddy
This is making me  get through the period of no football. Brilliant content
You’re the best Foz, honestly. Keep up the good work.
lemme just say, I'm a Liverpool fan and I gotta say well played on the 3-0 thrashing against us I think you are a very underrated keeper :)
Wasn't that a foul on you for the last minute goal?
Eddie Howe in disguise at 2:51 - 2:53 - Steward wearing blue haha
Going to admit I am not a Watford fan but a big fan of you Ben love what you do and how you go about wha to you do I know you do comps but would love if you would do a pair of your gloves as I am a keeper coach for my u13 so that would be a great prize to win unlucky with the late goal keep the videos coming 👍
Ben is the most open footballer In  the world change my mind
Gotta be in the corner plus I’ve always been a big fan of you Ben ever since you were at the baggies make my day and like this comment❤️
Should be England's number 1.
My favourite part is the claps
Unlucky on the result but dont let that get to your mind had a great game and keep going Your channel is going amazing rn ben
Bet you wish you caught that effort you tipped over the bar that lead to the corner and eventual goal. Never mind. Great content. Great lad. Stay with us another season plz
Corner go pro is better in my opinion 👍🤙
this guy is Inspiration i swear
Can't believe nobody's though of thisbefore! Genious! Really cool to be able to watch the games from different perspectives!
Leeds Utd fan here Absolutely love this channel
Amazing video! Keep up the good work!
Great content as always just wondering if you realise you said 2-2 in the end 😉🤣 keep it up buddy
Ben I prefer the new camera angle in the centre of the goal .
Love it again pal. But come on now mate give us Troy Deeney.
Love these vids man, looking forward to the video when you play Bristol City
As a keeper my self I like to watching what Ben does to improve some keeper skills
TOP CONTENT
Keep going ben you absolute legend.
Another good vid
I love this!!!!
Apart from the last minute goal , really enjoyed it . Love the new wide angle lens .
You didn't shout 'NO!' like you normally do, that's why it went in!
This is brilliant. As a Bournemouth fan u lot played brilliant, especially defensively. Loving the series mate 👍🏼
Great to see you start this channel, Ben. Cheers for letting us see a footballer’s perspective of a match day. All the best for the season. From a Southampton fan 👍
This is superb
Old angle back pls
Love your channel Ben, so good to see what goes on behind the scenes!
This is my favourite channel right now. REAL CONTENT!!
Amazing videos Ben keep it up 👏🏽💪🏽
Yes mate middle is better
9:06-9:11 Bournemouth No.9 was left unguarded the whole time! So unfortunate.
Ben's the hero we didn't deserve but needed 😂 keep up the good work mate I'm loving it
Love how he rocks the T90’s top lad haha
Love how down to earth he is, what a guy! 💪
What a genuine guy! love the positivity and the channel. All the best mate :)
Yesss great content
i like the camera in the corner of the goal Ben, gives us a better view of the corners
Love this Fozzy! Seeing the goal from the goal angle is such a different perspective than on the TV hard camera. Looking forward to the game Tuesday night.
Ben I reckon you are a book man front of the coach whilst the younger lads cause chaos at the back
Ben foster you said it was 2-2 on 9:45 mate 😬 keep up the good work allways thought you was a top class keeper from a villa fan 👍
Literally Ben the best channel on youtube I'm really enjoying the videos it's so fascinating
Splendid geezer
What a genuine nice guy he is.
After a goal u know he’s about to say: “U little beauty!”
Love These Vids ❤️
I love these Foster these make my day watching a game from the gks perspective keep these going unlucky on the goal I was gutted for you I hope u do well this season and get out of the league! Cheers for cheering my day up!
Love the video, keep up the good work 👍
Great Video again👏🏻love to see!Which pair of sell gloves do you were?
i think he likes the phrase ' you little BEAUTYYYYYY"... such a interesting viewing especially as it highlights the differences from semi pro to the prog game, in terms of talking.
3:56 hahaha 😂
love this channel
Couldn't of had a better bloke to do this. What a dude Ben Foster is. Great career too, congrats from Stoke 👍
Hey Ben, love the channel mate well done, its pure quality seriously! Watched you from the terraces as an Everton fan for many years with each club you have played for, vocal, and always in control of your emotions, must be great to play in front of 👍 shame about the end result just one of them things. More than enough quality within that squad to get back to the top tier. Look forward to the next vid, my lad loves watching them too.
Mr Foster, I’m a West Ham fan, but there is nothing better then seeing a The cycling Gk video in my recommend video’s think your a top keeper, love your positive and passion! Can’t wait for the next video! Hope you enjoyed your beer!
Starting to follow Watford results because of your videos 😂
Jesus I love this channel. Ingenious idea from Ben Foster. Keep it coming!
I support Coventry,  you and our keeper marko Marosi are my fav keepers in the world keep up the good content ⚽️👏
Thank you Ben, really enjoy seeing the game from your perspective.  Had no idea how vocal and assertive you are during a game.  When Vic Rd is full and heaving you can't hear anything the players are saying from where I sit.  Also really enjoy your behind the scene footage.
Could you delve into your time at Man Utd, who you played with, what the day to day life there was like? Really enjoying your videos
Yo
Great video as always Ben. Would love to see a bit more footage of your distribution!
Absolutely love these videos. Great insight for footballers to see the behind the scenes. Great professional and a fantastic goalkeeper
we need more deeney cameos
Hi I am a massive fan do u mind if I ask u what gloves u us mate keep up the good work
In the corner of the goal is better bro
class channel this
I’m a Liverpool supporter, but I love your videos. Is there a possibility that you can put the time of the game and the goals up on the screen?
Quality content this! Love it Ben!
Fine with new go pro in centre. Looks great.  Gutted with late goal as we deserved all 3 points. Another great vid.
Why don’t you have two or three  go pros in the goal for different angles. Love the vids my guy!!
Ive been watching you play in the prem for ages and think your quality,im 18 in a few days and would love a personal message, keep up the good work
Love the videos, can’t wait to see millwall win on the channel too🤣keep it up👍
Ben before the start of the game and befor the second half u need to say “come on then boys” and Watford will win the game
Top man love the content always been a fan brother and top keeper to 👊
Best videos on YouTube right now 👍👍👍👍
Despite me supporting Luton, Ben Foster has got a great sense of humour and is just a lovely person in general. Keep it up Ben 💪
every goalkeeper needs to make a channel like this😂
I think we need some merch in the near future 👀
Hi Mate loving the series it’s so interesting and it’s got so much potential. a baseball player called Trevor Bauer has done the same and it’s made him one of the most popular in the game
I’m a Rangers fan but watching this is class, good to see the game day routine of a player.
Cheeky little nut meg from the net 😁. Great content Ben from a baggie. Keep it up.
great video!! I think the camera in the corner shows a bit of a better angle. Can't wait for the next video
I hope to see more content like this from other players. The next best thing to dreaming about being a footballer is being a fly on the wall in the changing room. And to have man like Ben Foster leading the way is a great watch. What a man!
Not expecting a response, but what I’d love to know is how often you change your gloves? Because I know some keeper swap them after a certain number of goals conceded!
Such a good channel!  Love this stuff!
best goalie out there
Im not a watford fan but i love this channel. Brilliant content
Quality channel Ben, love the craic you have the lads
Desperately unlucky especially since they should have had a red. Brilliant performance especially as we have many new players and a new gaffer.. loving the cycling keeper and in my humble opinion the go pro is better in the centre of the goal.. good luck at Wycombe Ben 👍👍COYH 😊😊
Love the videos Ben
Kind of wished you played for my team so I could see how it all goes on at Newcastle👍🏻
Top stuff Ben. My favourite YouTube channel of 2020. BOOM 💪🏾!
Love every second👏👏👏👏👏
Unlucky that last minute equaliser was very disappointing
Best football gk with a youtube chanell
Great content lad!
BETTER CONTENT THEN WHAT YA GETTING FOR £14.99 ON BOX OFFICE, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK BEN
Amazing video once again Ben, it is a fantastic channel and I think you are an amazing goalkeeper who never gives up
Prefer over angle fosy mate
Loving these videos Ben, new camera lense/angle looks class!
Love stuff like this it should be an option in tv coverage matches.Thanks Ben
this is content
These videos are endlessly fascinating. The close and intimate look inside the life of a professional footballer is amazing. I’m here for the long haul.
Great insight into the life as a pro so inspirational hopefully we’ll see you in the prem next season
Reckon this angle is better but maybe put the camera further back? Behind the netting maybe
you ever sitting around and suddenly think "I made it"
the wide angle lens gives a wider view but it also distorted the depth perception.
I like the other camera angle
9:09 - DEFENCE GONE AWOL.. It's terrible defence when you see goalie had to contest an aerial against 3 OPPONENTS!!
This is exactly what everybody needs,great content
unlucky mate but im sure its going to be a clean sheet win this tuesday all the best Ben Foster
Can't wait for the next video!! Subscribed as well, keep doing what you're doing
So good to watch the ins & outs! Loving the videos
Mate love your channel. From a Chelsea fan 👍
I prefer the corner camera - Maybe just getting used to change but I guess you will want to see what pleases the majority.
This is such a terrific channel, from a terrific bloke from what I  can tell! Next step up...wear a GoPro on your head?! 😂
As a goalkeeper myself I absolutely love this🙌🏼
In my opinion, the new camera angle would be better with all 4 corners of the goal post in frame.
What a great insight this channel offers can’t believe Ben is the only one doing this, great vid
New camera angle is boss Fozzy, loving the videos, let’s not neglect the bike content! Keep up the good work mate.
The best footballing content on youtube at the moment. Such a fabulous and refreshing view of the game and different persepctive for us to watch and appreciate from.   But Ben, ketchup on your pasta and chicken?! Very questionable indeed!!
I hope watford get promoted. I would love this kind of content in the PL!
Always liked you as a keeper mate, even when you played for Utd (my team) I thought you were great, keep going 🙌
Love this so much!!
Loving it !!
Definitely prefer the new lens in the middle of the goal
Love the vids, cant wait to see you play Cardiff 🔵⚽️
Love the Videos Ben, such a great insight to a footballer
The go pro needs to be be either further back (wide angle) or back in the corner 🤟🏼
Cant wait to see this series in the premier league!
2-2??? U were playing in the match Ben 😂😂
Class video again Ben
Ben This Is My Favourite Channel Right now Keep up the Good work🙌🙌🙌
Keep up the hard work Ben! You and the team deserved it!!
Man what I’d give to be able to be a professional goalkeeper. Never gonna happen, but I wish I was good enough
You beautyyyy
West Ham fan and mad cycling nut here. Love the series and how down to earth you are. As for the camera, I preferred it in the corner.
Brilliant channel ben, hardcore to eat pasta n chicken so early in the morning.  You've inspired me to get on my bike and try to lose lots of weight and fresh air in me lungs. Good luck for the wycombe game
Living the dream man, I play soccer and ride my bike competitively would be killer if I could do both every day all day.
Love them classic T90 boots Ben 🤩
When the premier league wage is cut so you try look for other ways of income
I finally found my best YouTuber.
How many times was “Jeremy” said in this video? (6 marks)
Why do you cut your socks and wear white ones?
Unlucky Ben I cannot Wait until The Fans Come in Imagine The Atmosphere Also How are you allowed Your Go Pro in the goal
Loving this channel mate. Just a suggestion, is their a chance you could do a training video. So maybe bring your go pro training? Keep up the top work mate
Fair play to the way you treat and respect every single member of the club. From the chefs to the kit man, no one is treat any different. What a bloke.
Only a matter of time before a goal is scored that hits poor Ben's GoPro. Let's hope that doesn't happen lol
Another great video Ben, loving the new go-pro fish-eye lense  👍🏻
I Excite 😂 love it
Solid camera angle 👍
Love it Ben. Love the insight
Class that ben
Great content, love this channel. It's a cool way of getting a 'behind the scenes' in the life of a professional footballer. Well done, Ben.
this series is too good would be more interesting when fans are allowed back in
in all fairness, that was your fault
Ben, it was 1-1 not 2-2 !!!
Ben. I'm gonna put a spanner in the works here. 1 in each corner and 1 in the middle. the middle is great for the box action and the corner is better for the flank action. might cost you a lot more in editing time though. sorry
Cannot wait until the stadium is full of supporters and hear all the chants on Foster.
Watford’s number 1🙌
This is great !
Love channel ❤ you top keeper but score wasc11
Honestly I'm loving this and it's the first video I'm watching of this love it Ben
This series has to be my new favourite on youtube and your experience shows not once do you hear you rip into your teammates always full of encouragement must make the defence’s job alot easier
Love it. very exciting whenever these come out
Jesus my old man is in nearly every video 🤣🤣🤣
Another amazing video keep up the amazing work
Unlucky lads!
Gutted with the result but I prefer this over VAR
Hello Ben, you've got a great channel I love the content! Give greetings to coach Ivic from PAOK Thessaloniki, Greece!
Didn’t you play for West Brom at one point
This series is honestly so good it’s so interesting to get insight into all the behind the scenes and everything keep it up Ben
Can you please show us how do you warm up before a match.
I’m a Bournemouth fan I watch you though every time  I looked at your net and thought we’re is the GoPro
Wasnt that a Foul?
Next player to score run to the go pro and say “subscribe to cycling GK channel” would be class
I think I prefer the angle before mate! Much love mate! Love you and this channel! <3
The view in the center is pretty good, but i prefer in the corner, because not only can you see the whole goal, you can see more of the action going on in the flanks
That “NO” when Ben thinks the ball might be going in. I felt that.
The best channel hands down 👌
When I watch the match on tv I'm constantly looking at the goal to try and see your go pro haha 😂😂
Imagine the scenes when the fans are back and Watford's back in the Premier League
Great videos love what you do as a football fan think others should take note and do the same you are playing really well at the moment maybe an England call up soon stay safe from a pompey fan and England fan
I acc like this Chanel keep it up for the season 🥶🤝🔥
I watch a little bit of that game and it was great
Not sure if I like the wide view it looks dark Ben
Go pro middle of the goal.. Perfect 👌. I have left over pizza /Indian, Chinese takeaway for breakfast 😋 Love the footage.. Better than MOTD😘👍
Great stuff Ben. Love your videos.  Hope more keepers will think about doing the same
Hi liverpool fan like watching this maybe move the go pro a tiny bit to see both posts but I like the go pro better this way
i have know you since you playd for Man United bro! 😉❤
Found this channel by chance and I'm so happy I did. Wonderful insight into footballer's lives and shows just how hard it is to be goalkeeper!
I'd love to be a goalkeeper I used to be in goal all the time when I used to play football with friends because I was better then all of them
The angle was good you should keep it🔥
This is really helpful to my friends who are goalkeepers I tell them to watch you in net on your Channel
I'm not a Watford supporter, but these are brilliant. Please don't stop!
This is the best football channal in my opinion it's fun to watch  I think the old camera angle is best
This is brilliant!
I’m an aston villa fan and this is some top quality content, don’t quit ben!
Nice and vocal
Class this pal
Either angle is good, keep up the good content.
Great video
This is the best football channel right now🔥
This is class love watching every video you make 🙌🙌
The pre match meal always makes me hungry
Great vid, plz can we see a half 12 kick off routine away from home
Great to watch and hear you communication throughout the game. Hoping to replicate it in mine on Saturday🤞
Good as always Ben ..... try the wide angle in the corner maybe ? Good luck Tuesday evening 👍
Love this man
Good stuff for my son to watch is how you talk to the team throughout the match. He’s actually the Sunday keeper for one of the Watford academy coaches (Raspass) and could do with some tips!!!
I freakin love this ! So simple and enjoyable to watch . Keep the vids coming please . I’m all here for it 🙅🏾‍♂️👏🏾🙏🏾
Where is your splendid save on Solanke in the 60th minute?! Otherwise great videos keep up the good work
Great video Ben! Something to look forward to in these difficult times.
just found out about this channel, and i'm so glad i did, love your vids keep it up
Legend. unlucky
Subscribers are rocketing up! Fair play to you Mr Foster. Keep up the quality content.
Why are these videos so good
Loving all the vids on the channel! 👍
Greatest  channel ever
Was looking for the gopro on Sky Sports, saw it in the middle and wasn't sure if it was legit!!
I hang my go pro in my goal for my channel. On super wide it fits pretty much the whole goal in 💪🏼
Personally believe you should position the camera with the wide lenses on the corner. That’ll look much better
Loudest things known to man. Ben foster smacking his gloves
Wish he was still at West Brom. Fantastic keeper !! Great channel keep it up mate
Another great video but I prefer the old camera in the corner, gives a better view of the posts and it means you’re always in frame.
Great stuff mate keep up the good work 🧤
Love this channel, top guy.
Love this channel I’m a Manchester United fan remember when Ben used to play for us, respect to Watford back in the prem in no time joao Pedro is insane!!
new fave channel , cant wait for the forest game.
I love this as I show a lot of my young goalkeepers and show them that look as heartbreaking football can be remember  bad results or last min goals happen to everyone  But we remember even if football is our life it’s a game and we should enjoy and learn every game 👌😊⚽️
Love the new camera angle 📹
you’re doing such a cracking job with this Ben! i’m a spurs fan and i’ve found myself cheering on Watford when i see them play, keep it up and good luck for the season!
I was really enjoying this channel, but ketchup on pasta or chicken, dear god man, I'm out!
Super Meps, sorry Ben but great content
Shame about the result... better luck next time lads! Loving these videos Ben, keep it up!!!
Enjoying all these videos, would love to see your goalkeeping sessions and a look into what gloves you wear
Better then watching footy at the moment top GK as well love u at United
Great content Ben,love it.Greeting from Greece.
Great one ben, unlucky to concede
absolutely brilliant channel
This is a fantastic channel
Im curious, will you carry on making these when crowds come back or are you just doing it for this season?
Petition for Ben to give away his shirt in the next episode
But who got the Pedro shirt
Best keeper ite
Love these vlogs miss being at the Vic but this is definitely the next best think keep it up mr foster top man
I’m a Bournemouth fan and thought ur defence and goalkeeping was amazing !!!!!!!!!
Better off with the camera in the corner!
It wouldn't be a cycling gk video without the classic "you little beauty"
Top bloke and top channel Ben. Keep up the great work and will be keeping an eye out for the Hornets results good luck this season GK.
Glad this just popped up in recommended, great idea & giving a lot of insight. Keep it up!
Love the videos ben!!!
ngl I used to really dislike you when you was at West Brom and everytime you played us you would waste some much time to try and nick a point. these videos have massively changed my opinion and you actually a proper decent bloke. love what your doing keep it up mate
Great turnaround from filming to getting the vids out Ben.   Is it all you for the editing or do you get any help?
if i would play in the championship and watch his videos i would try everything to score against him and them grab the camera and celebrate into it hahahahahha
Nice new camera wide angle Ben, how about putting the wide angle in the back corner for the Wycombe game, to see what the wide view looks like, so we can judge both GoPro locations! Cheers mate!
@Ben Foster - The Cycling GK  I'm not even a Watford fan I'm an oxford united fan and I still love watching your videos
2:48 cheeky Borat reference
YOU LITTLE BEAUTY!!!! 😤💪🏾
BIG GUYYY!!!!
This channel is legendary, keep up the good work on yt and good luck in battle for premier again...
Hello Ben how are you?
In my option the corner angle is better because we can see more of the goal
Loving the channel Ben quality idea
Best footballer channel in the world!
I think the old angle is better. Still can’t see all of the goal. From a wba fans perspective. Its great to see that a man who has done so much for my club is doing well.
There's not much Ben could have done on that equalizer to be fair. He's getting charged on his punch so can't really send it where he wants and then the volley is just out of reach for him. Some will say he could have caught the ball instead of tipping it over the bar right before that so Bournemouth wouldn't have had that corner kick but at this moment of the match, with a wet ball and all the tension going on, it was the right choice to play it safe rather than taking the risk to drop it right in front of the strikers.  Unlucky Ben, in some other leagues, the ref would have given you a free kick on that one.
please can I get a reply, ben your a great goalkeeper
I'm getting so gassed and motivated to keep working as a goalie after these sick, creative, unnecessary good videos!! ❤️❤️❤️
Imagine Ben and Zlatan in the same team 😂 when Zlatan scores.. Ben says "u little beauty".. Would Zlatan reply "no, little beauty is Zlatan" or "I'm a big beauty" 🤔😂
Great vid, great keeper. Top man 🙏🏻
HEY Ben, what do you reckon to Tao this afternoon? Great channel BTW from a former GK and current weekend warrior 😊 🚴‍♀️🚴‍♀️😊
Absolutely love the behind the scenes. Such a good insite to see what acc goes on. Keep these up 👌🏼
Absolutely love the vids, my little brother loves you he has one of your shirts  is there any chance you could you sign it for him?!
In the corner some can get a better angle of your saves  UpWithTheWatfordWereGoingUpWithTheWatford ⚫🟡⚫🟡
Other angle is better I think Ben.Great Vid once again
Dope vid!
Keep the camera in the centre of the goal Ben.
Been loving this videos, really cool to see. Say hi to my fellow Croatian Stipe! :D
Class man on and off the pitch
Great content again
i love this channel
Probably my favourite channel love these short of videos
Gutted with the point as we played really well. Those results happen in the Championship unfortunately. Onto the next one, we're really showing grit this season
Rooting for Watford to get back in the prem
“ you little beauty “
Unlucky Ben, your a great goalkeeper, I’m a goalkeeper to and your my idol you are fantastic then saves against Bournemouth (h), villa (h) and Sheffield united (a) were fantastic
Dont support watford but lv the content its great
I love this channel its really cool to see an insight of how pros live and play etc hopefully I can become one too!
Prefer it in the corner
I reckon wide angle lens in the back corner you will catch more of the goal that way
can you not put the go pro on the advertisement board behind the goal ? 🤷🏻‍♂️
i saw it on the tv...the camera haha
Personally prefer with the camera in the middle..but to be fair....whatever angle you position is...still gonna watch! Top channel, easily my new favourite! Have a grand old evening and looking forward to the next video!
Love it keep it up really enjoying this so you have to eat the same food as the outfield players
Still Englands true no1 gk
can you do a video of a recovery day after a game
Keep up the class videos, unlucky this week.
Love the videos Ben and the camera angle in the middle is much better 👏🏻🤙🏻
this channel will grow so quick it’s unreal
Absolutely loving the videos Ben! So amazing to get an insight of such a high level and be there with you! Would it be possible to get a minute counter in the corner like how you do with the goals but for all the other clips too? Just a suggestion. But think wide angle towards the right corner could be the best idea! Looking forward to the next one and good luck for Tuesday!!
I'd say the old angle is better but it's so cool to see you thinking of new ways to improve the videos Keep up the great content!
Imagine go pro in the goal with stadium full of fans, that atmosphere
Ya know I do love this channel, like we can’t be at matches and this is the next best thing for sure. I like some of the camera angles from both. Like with the camera in the corner, I can see more action down the wing, but central it’s more action in the box. So I’m down for what ever angle you go for, unlucky for the last minute goal but I think Bournemouth should have been down a player with some of the tackling going on, but like you said broad shoulders and a beer 👌🏻 nice one for doing these videos seriously they are awesome
Amazing content...
I can’t be the only one watching EFL Highlights to see if the GoPro is in the back of the goal??
Absolutely love these videos mate quality viewing keep them coming
Loving this, not a Watford fan but it’s very enjoyable
Maybe 2 go pro cameras needed  behind & at the side  netting would be good to review the angles plus interesting footage for future video
Great seeing how vocal professional goalkeepers are. Shouting advice and encouragement all game. Great channel great videos.
This is awesome!! Rooting for Watford to promote!
Never knew players dropp f bomb when they concead
Absolutely loving every video Ben! Keep up the great work as a player and a camera man haha
Cmon Ben,I love y my friend up the hornets
Great video as usual
I say the corner angle is best... Great content Ben
This channel is amazing, really love the content. I'm a Leicester fan but always liked you as a keeper. Do you think you will continue to do this when fans return to the grounds?
Found this channel lastnight and honestly I’ve already watched every video
Brilliant content! This reminds me of another pro playing in the 3rd division of sweden. His name is Conor O'Keefe. Have you seen his channel and if you have what do you think about it? Here's the link to his channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/ConorOKeefe
Great videos keep them coming love the go pro and the way to g up your mates on the pitch
I applaud you for this.
Really enjoying the content. I have always admired Ben as a keeper but since he started this channel, it is obvious he is a really top bloke as well. C'mon the Boys!!!
I love goalkeepers man, I feel they are always the nicest people.
Love what you do Ben, as an aspiring youtuber and footballer I love your content 👏
Love these videos Ben, you're a legend.  Great insight into what we don't see/hear through the TV or at grounds when there's fans.  👍🏻  Keep going, can't wait for Tuesday.
Put manual captions.
Love the channel Ben and great video loved every second of it
These vids are a great watch Ben will be cheering on Watford in the championship 💙
ben foster ,top quality videos xx
Put a camera in each corner. Come on! Wasn’t 2-2 though Ben 😂😂
Who is the Watford manager?
I’m not a Watford fan but keep up the great content Ben loving the great saves
Top video, miss seeing you in the Prem!
Loving these videos mate, really good to see exactly what you go through each game. Planning on putting a GoPro in my goal for Sunday League, 1... for good saves, but 2... to analyse any mistakes etc!
Loving the videos at the moment Ben top quality content 👍
Absolutely love the content Ben. Personally thought preferred the GoPro in the corner rather than dircelty behind you. Lens just isn't wide enough to capture a lot of the goal.
Another comment blanked cheers Ben me think un subscribe obviously got his favourites
Another Wicked video Benny👏🏻👏🏻💙🤍
Absolutely love it, great way to keep us football fans involved. Top man aswell and miss seeing you in the sticks at WBA.
this is excellent, the ball never looks like it is his with as much pace when watching on tv compared to when ur behind the goal, keep up the good work
You said you only ever get nervous on the way to the team bus. How did you figure out a way to not get nervous on the pitch? Wicked vid as always Fozzy. Love to see it. Winner winner, chicken for breakfast dinner.
This is great.  Love the concept Ben, enjoyed sitting in the back of the net all game ☺️👍🏻
Awesome video, I prefer the other camera thought, cheers ben
This is some of the best videos on YouTube, there class, prefer the old angle personally
i might do a budget cycling gk episode 14mph cycle with a bit of sunday league/7 a side goalkeeping thrown in...
Love this from an arsenal fan man this is class
Definitely prefer the corner angle
Any chance you record your warm up as well would love to see what you do to get yourself ready for a game!?
Thanks for the feedback guys, I love the comments you lot leave👍👏🙌😘
This is very good and entertaining to watch
I'm a Liverpool fan but I gotta respect u
Ok, opinion seems divided about the new camera angle,, how about I use the wide angle lens but position the camera in the corner like normal??
Best channel by far love the videos
This is a great YouTube channel!
You’re content is 🔥🔥🔥
Another fantastic video
Keep up the good work! More of a fan of the previous angle in goal rather than the new wide angle
Love thé old angle a lot more great to be close too an experienced professional keeper and see exactly how you communicate teaches things you don’t get taught in training
Love watching these videos of go pro I’m a Bournemouth fan but also a gk so love these gold luck for the season
Not even a Watford fan but these are great to watch
Ben you remind me so much of James Haskell on YouTube! Great personality and fascinating to see a how you talk to your teammates! Great Job!
The new angle is really good Ben!! I could see the whole stadium which is excellent. I'd say stick with the new wide angle lens mate
I’d prefer the corner.
Love it Ben 🤪!!  Do you do all the editing yourself or do u get someone else to do it for u??
I'm a Bournemouth fan but got big respect for you
looking forward to when you come to forest. Keep it up ben
I think corner of the net is a better angle
Best series and channel on YouTube
you chezz
Do sometimes hope that the other team gets a chance just so you can have some action?
From watching you here at Vicarage Road... Foster you’re a Hero and such an idol for me and like to be like you one day 💛 I learned a lot from you and hope you keep this videos The camera angle is perfect but we cannot see what happens at the Whole box like beside the line and corner so hope you find a solution
Love it! I like the wide angle, but this position made it seem like the camera was pointing a little up. I prefer the previous videos where the camera was looking out onto the field rather than slightly up. Maybe try and keep the wide angle but change the vertical angle to look more out onto the field! Either way, great content as always!
Can't wait to see these match days with fans
Ask Dan if he can come back to killie
Great work as usual but I do prefer the old angle 💪
Another banger keep it up Ben love watching these vids
Prefer the other angle but either way i'm not complaining :)   This is just such a good idea !!!  Keep it up and Good Luck !
Another class video, Ben. Proper confident goalkeeping and would still walk into most Prem teams. Quick question: Is there a reason why you don’t show all the goals that Watford score / concede? E.g you said it was 2-2 but we only saw the final goal go in against you?
'That is a thing of beauty' love it hahaha
I really hope we (Manchester United) play watford in the FA Cup so i can see how you react to playing your former team, keep up these great videos Ben!
Where is Troy deeny
It seems strange to hear everything that's going on
I find that the camera in the corner was better
Im from Malaysia and im a Big fan of this channel!! Love the contents. Keep up the good work Ben!
Well played Ben from a Bournemouth fan I'll take a point all day against you guys! Thanks for bringing us fans closer to the action in these crazy times ⚽⚽
Old camera angle 👍
Personally think corner view is better would be great with the wide view lens I think. Love watching your vids
Absolute legend
Get the feeling u wanted to smash that ref in the face after that 😂
I was looking for your camera during the game 😂
Loving the wide angle from the middle of the goal. And loving the channel top stuff
Great to see the day though the eyes of a pro
i am curious if watford got promoted to bpl, can he do this again?
Prefer the old angle but adore the content!
Shame you didn’t do this at the Albion it would of been great to see what it was like behind the scenes at my club
These Videos are like Ben Foster fuckin class
Absolutely love this!!
nice content
love this
Great game Ben Foster and I hope your family are well during covid gutted not to see you play
Great stuff Ben, shame about the result, but as you say that's football, Great view from the middle. COYH'S
9:40 you said it was 2-2.. was only 1–1 according to sky sports
Only been watching two days but this is now my favourite channel. Very interesting to see such a high level player that's so down to earth. Aswell as getting to watch the games more intimently than currently normal. The wide view is so much better aswell!
I think i prefer the other angle - either way love the videos
I recommend if you do the normal lens in the middle
Best with the camera in the corner, for me. Thanks for the great content.
Love the little borat bit on the bus, I excite
What a channel and what a man, he would make a great podcast host 😉
Wow Ben you are a genius
Good camera angle, but I feel the corner camera view was better, but having found this channel randomly has been amazing, love the game and inside bits us fans don't see
legend 🙌🏾
I prefer the old
I like the camera in the corner more, I like being able to see the entirety of one side of the field. When it's the middle you can't really see anything at the corners.
“I excite” loved the borat reference
What do footballer have in there bag ??
Who else watches Watford games now and look in the net to find the go pro.
4:37 Ben launches the ball into space
top tier
imagine kepa with a channel like this “yh couldn’t dive for that one it was a bit far innit, probably tomori’s fault tho i’m ngl”
I'm a Bournemouth fan but you are one of the best goalkeepers in the championship. Keep up the good work!
Ben just an idea what about the go pro in the stand behind you? Maybe a bit high up. Could be some good angles
This is like keeping goals but instead of Sweden is England cool video
Unlucky today Ben
Prefer the other lens Ben, another great video though. Good borat impression too😂 Good luck for Tuesday 👍🏽
Love this series ben!
Good channel but I think the GoPro in the corner is better
new angle got me thinking, maybe a 360° go pro in the centre of the goal so you can move the angle in post depending on where the play is?
Damn life as a pro footballer in a top club is so good especially with the facilities and the food. But you guys definitely deserve it a 100 percent especially with all the hard work you have put on the pitch over the years.
Guys the camera in the corner of the goal is better Like if you agree 👇
Played well fozzy, your right in saying that's football...loving the channel boss
Unlucky Watford Bournemouth for a very good Side
2 all in the end 🤔 1-1 mate 🤣 great channel 🙌🏻 also I personally like the other angle better as u see more I feel. Or if this camera can go behind the goal and poke through the net maybe for more post to post shot either way sick channel 👍🏻
9:14 double whammy, you get megged as well 😂
Do you do the editing yourself?
Camera Lens is not big enough i'd go back to the corner but great content
Loving these vids.
Ben I think the camera angle is good, but I recon you should maybe try get 2, just so we can see the whole play, down the wings, your positioning etc. I’m a keeper myself and I f*cking love this, best footballing channel out there with out a doubt.
I prefer the center camera age as it is true gk perspective.
Its nice to see every football player had their own youtube channel, goodluck for your career mr ben foster. Have a nice day 👍
Would be great to be back in the ground but in the mean time this is top draw.
I like this angle better! You win some, you lose some
Gutted at end...great vid... feeling the  lump on Tuesday.. double Watford and posh....no pressure Ben...keep um out 👊
I still love this video but I think I prefer the camera in the corner
Best keeper in the league mate🤝🔵
I'm an arsenal fan but you just can't not like Ben
I’d say but it back in the corner
So it was 2-2 then, can you tell hive live to give me my money back Ben as I've only seen 2 goals lol !!
I think the camera position was fine maybe put it more to the centre couldnt bit of the right side but i prefered the corner camera way better
I like when u put camera on the right corner like the old videos mate
More keepers should do this amazing 🙌🏾
Back to the corner please
Up the shagging Cherries
The other angle is better Ben 👍
This channel is brill. It gives the fans who didn't have the skill to make it at football to really see what goes on behind the scenes and on the pitch. This would be a great channel for all the young goalkeepers out there to see the organisation of the defence and positional play that the keeper is responsable for that you don't get to see on t.v.
I like the go pro in the corner of the goal better, maybe one go pro in each corner if possible?
Love the videos it’s great for us to see how a professional footballer prepares for matches and how much goes on in a game . I never realised how much communication a goal keeper makes till I  started watching your channel . In my honest option the go pro is better in the corner I think you see much more . Keep the videos coming and look forwards to the next .big fan 👍
"Two all"?
love the vlogs Ben. This is my new favourite channel.
Class video, im seriously inspired by you
Yes Fozzie! Loving the new lens, can see a bit more of the game 👌🏼 Look forward to the next video. Come on the lads! 💛
Addicted to these vids    Thanks for behind the scenes content
this helps me with my calling whilst in goal cheers.
From being transitioned into a keeper late on myself these are very good to watch always great to see a keepers perspective on stuff very rarely see
I liked the corner perspective more
Quality again mate
What an absolute legend.
Really unlucky today Ben we would’ve won if the ref made the correct decisions 🐝
Who else doesn’t watch the highlights Bcos you know this video is coming out?!?  Yet again killing it! 100k soon babyyyy
Loving the content Ben! For me, I prefer the GoPro in the corner instead of the middle, but keep up the good work!
my g
Watched the game you were brillian in goal
This might just be the best channel on YouTube right now....
A proper legend !
For a future video could you go into detail about the gloves you wear and what you look for in your gloves and if you have had any trouble with previous gloves that you dont recommend. Love the channel doing a great job Ben.
Felt like a loss :(
7:52 nooooooooo
Best channel on YouTube and I’m not even a Watford fan
The positivity to his teammates win lose or draw is brilliant to see,Love it big man!
Is the place that you go before the games the training ground or a hotel?
2 all? Thought it was 1 all
Why I get up on a Sunday to see Ben Foster upload 😌
9:40 2 all in the end? Don't you mean 1 all Ben? 😂 Anyway class video, I definitely prefer the GoPro in the centre of the goal
You know it’s good when you are gutted when it ends!!
Did you say 2 all in the end? Great video's though. Keep it up.
Every meal needs tomato sauce love it! Unlucky with the result Ben chin up 👍
Keep up the good work Ben.
Churning them videos out now Ben 👏🏼 Prefer the go pro in corner as we can see the whole goal. When we record my games we’ve had the GoPro behind the goal to get it all in but the viewer then has to look through the net which isn’t great either
how can’t you love this man
Im always pumped whenever you upload a video...its always amazing!! Hope u keep this up and keep the great vids and saves coming!! Love this channel!!
Great guy great video great performance as per  great idol for any young person wanting to be a keeper
Quality video again
A better camera position may be on the advertising board behind the goal as then you will be able to see the full goal. Hope this helps 👍🏻
Last minute equalisers are always brutal..... keep up the good work Fozzy
Can i join watford ? I’m above average player and i play Cam / st / lw / rw Dm me IG @x8.c4
Loved the new angle my man! Keep that chin up! I'm rooting for yienz!
oi ben i prefer the other angle mate
I actually love these vids
I personally prefer the go pro in the corner of the goal
3:57 this man is built different 😂
Loving the content
Top boy Ben.
Unlucky Ben ,  Onto Wycombe mate
Quality channel
Unreal channel👏👏👏👏
Nice content Ben
Love the wide angle in the middle of the goal. Great channel Ben
I have been taking my virtual classes about soccer with your channel, you are amazing Ben!!!! Fantastic work.
“ u little beauty”
Personally think the camera angle was slightly better in the corner but still enjoying the content either way!
I was distracted by that awesome looking clouds.
Come to spurs !
Deffo prefer the old angle, we can see more of the wide areas of the pitch, and it can be difficult to see how close you are to a post  I personally love these as they help with my positional sense  But that’s just my opinion
Love the camera angle .  Tough match !!! Love your content, thank you Ben
When fans are allowed in are still going to upload these types of videos?
Love the new camera angle, it works great! I was wondering if it would somehow be possible to hang the camera in the net, so we could get a higher field of view? :)
4:05 3 balitas por favor :v
Great video but I think the corner was better as you could see if the ball went in any way keep up the good work hope you can get back to the prem
Love this. Such an original idea!
Ben you need to move the go pro back. We cant see the full goal and when you run right we lose vision of you
Love how you wear older boots, in another video you wore nike ctr360s from 2010ish and in this your wearing total 90s. Classic, love the older ones. Is there a reason for this, are they from your own collection or do you not rate the modern boots.
This is sick bro 🔥
Reckon you should use the wide angle in the corner to see what it's liel
Mmm
It’s eye opening how good the facilities are around the championship although the PL money for 5 seasons probably helped with that
A great incite into the games, it brings you guys closer to the fans, thank you. I would say that mixing the lenses up will add even more to these great videos, but I liked the artistic nature watching the clouds. You 'Oooorrrnns!
Being a goalkeeper myself and dreaming of becoming pro, unfortunately I’m not as gifted as you but this is just amazing, watching literally what it is like to be a professional footballer. Love it, Thankyou!
Better angle with the camera in the corner have to say, can see more build up play.
Keep using the wide-angle lens but have it in the corner instead. Loving the content ❤❤❤
Love the new angle. Really invaluable content for my son who is a gk at a efl academy. Cheers Ben 👍
Unlucky mate lovin the vids
Another Great video mate! Really hope you keep doing these if (when) you guys get back up to the Prem!
The other angle is better
Best football UTubet
Great video Ben 👍
I like the angle
This is great content! You are an inspiration!
Loving the new view Ben, just not happy the big save from Solanke wasn't part of the content. Great channel, keep up the great work 👍🏼
He said look at number 6😂😂
A point is better than none but Bournemouth should have had a couple sent off for some terrible challenges, thanks for another great video & roll on Tuesday. Enjoy your weekend.
As a Liverpool fan Ben your Chanel is class honestly mate I enjoy watching it so much and I also love cycling
Such a positive guy
Found this out accidentally  But as a keeper myself was it really accidental?
Eyy it's your prime minister here so good luck Ben.
I think the side camera angle is preferred. But wouldnt mind too much about either. Just happy to see the content!
Please say your continue this when fans are back. Would love to see and hear your interactions with them 😆
this is a better spot for the camera
I love that he’s always got to be the loudest 😂
Two all? What game were you playing Ben? 😂😂
back corner angle better imo!
Unlucky result but great video
Prefer the other angle with the GoPro mate, wide lense don't do it for me.
Think the camera in the corner is a slight bit better mate but serious game and good quality
Prefer the camera in the corner, gives a better angle!  What Gopro you use and whats your settings on?
So going down to the Championship makes you do this...
Love the camera lens Ben, keep up the great work
Is there any chance of being able to place it on or just behind the advertising board behind the goal to get a wider shot? If not I think the 'corner cam' worked out better
Another good game today, unlucky to concede late on.
You should put the camera at it's old spot we see the goal better
Loving these videos right now Ben
personally the corner angle is better, dk about everyone else tho
Why didn’t you start this 5 years ago ffs!
I like the corner camera better and it hives you more luck there where in the middle bad luck in the corner pls
love ❤️❤️the bonding between player, what a team spirit🔥🔥🔥💪🏻
Unreal Channel, makes all subscribers feel a connection with you unlike all other footballers.
Ben mate this is next level content, a go pro in the back of the onion bag? Never been seen before stuff. An old round top guy & premier league legend. Hope to see you back next season! Keep it up mate!
not even a fan but i love these
Not even a Watford fan but love these vids
Like the old way, but anyway is good as long as the videos keep coming
How did we not win that,how they finished with 11 men on pitch God only knows,new lens a success Ben,as you say on to Wycombe.❤🖤💛
Shame about the result love the series tho keep it up mate 👍🏻
Anyone else not a watford fan but still watches this and hope Watford win
Loving the videos Ben, unreal keeper cant wait to see more
this guy really about to start a trend
why would you dislike that? the guy works his ass off for us
im saying 5-0  when we play wycombe
Love it
i love you
Cant get enough of this content Ben, love it!
Love it Ben I might not be a Watford fan but I’m a goalkeeper and I enjoy your videos. I do prefer the GoPro in the corner of the goal so I can see the post and see your techniques getting down and fast. You’re doing a great job
Was anyone else not flabbergasted by the arm clapping thing Ben did?
quality vids
Love the vids ben
Hey Ben loving the video keep it up mate, I think for me the old lens is better and in the corner of the goal 🥅  👍🏽👊🏽
James Garner debut on the channel please
Nobody: Ben Foster: JEREMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
probably the best channel ive ever come across
Like the middle of the goal but the new lens makes everything curved class as always 🙌🏽🙌🏽
Love the camera the camera angle! Keep it up big lad💯
I said once and will say it again, this channel is gold and Ben is a natural communicator
1:07 is he expecting to concede then ? 😂
An outstanding video Ben and really unlucky with the final goal. Although other camera angle is a bit better.
09:44 2-2???? lol
I think i prefer the camera in the corner
Hi soz I’m late and this channel is spectacular
Class video again ben.
Love it big man!!!! Great new camera angle to help us catch all your world class saves.
9:43  hey Ben, was 1-1 mate 🤣
Class👏
Unlucky mate. I love the series tho!
Love it you
I ain’t gunna lie it don’t feel the same when it’s not in the corner 😂
I love how he is during the game and afterwards very self reflecting and focused on the positive things. Much love keep it up
I’ve always looked up to Ben Foster
Strange to see a pro so switched on with the format of YouTube vids. Hopefully starts a trend so we see other pros do the same
Vids keep getting better and better keep it up Ben 👍🏻
Keep angle pleasee! Goalkeeper idol😍
Love this series, finally get to see what goes on behind the scenes
Up the Cherries!! Well played though Ben love the vids!
Loving the wide angle lense
This is all I wait for nowadays 🤣 my sunday is now completed
Old
I prefer the new GoPro angle I think you should keep it
I think it’s better in the corner, cuz now we can’t rly see the right post....
Unlucky foster keep you head up high❤❤
Today's camera view was good but I would prefer the Corner view, also I am interested in the top corner camera views, I think you should try that one match, but great video as always. Love the Sky Sports Interview part as well :)
Just subscribed love your content. I used to be 20 stone I went on a fitness spree lost 5 half stone in a year and a half feeling healthy.😁😁
I’m surprised you didn’t complain about the goal it looked like you were blocked. Did you think it was a foul at the time?
Best Chanell in The world right now
I think I prefer it in the corner personally
Another wicked video! These videos have inspired my son to train even harder. He loves it. The excitement on his face when this new one was updated. You have a new number 1 fan!! Keep them coming Ben 👍🏼
Love the new angle Ben. Great watch again, thank you.
Lens isn’t wide enough somehow
Prefer the new camera angle Ben. Thanks again for providing us with the best content ever!
Ben my Son John is your biggest fan and we wait for these videos after every game. Just fantastic as usual, thank you ❤️🖤💛
BEN ITS A GRAT CHANNEL
Loving this channel
Keep them coming Fozzy , love watching your videos makes the weekend even better during these tough times. 🐝💛 COYH
Yes Ben! Loving every single vid even though I'm a leads fan, I hope Watford will come back to the prem. Good luck in future games.
Do you edit your own videos?
Love it
3:26 haaaa
Angle is perfect! Having it in the corner sometimes makes the perspective a bit confusing on where the balls going
Big Bournemouth fan here. Big respect to ben and i feel for him after Meps's equaliser
Great content, think the new wider middle angle is better
Is there anyway for you to put the camera in one of the top corners? So we can further onto the wings and further down the pitch? Keep it up pal
Keep the angle
Love the new camera angle
Love the new camera angle mate, not sure how much further back you could put it. But with there being no fans in the stadium could you get away with putting it on top of the advertisement board behind the goal? That way you get a real wide angle shot and we could see much more. Great channel, keep up the good work, Ben!
Ben, another great video, proper legend once again, played well against Bournemouth defensively good, but unlikely to concede late on, big game against Wycombe, I’ll be supporting the boys COYH
It's not easy being a goalie!!!😂😂
This is the future of football - players perhaps wearing miniature body cams.  It will be next level watching football
Love the content mate. As a Burnley fan I loved the pen save against Armstrong last week, but you’re becoming my new favourite YouTuber
Great video Ben, unlucky result, great performance though from the lads . Great to watch you guys play as Watford Fans at the moment. Heads up and keep going💪🙌
Absolutely loving this Ben, glad to see you’re enjoying doing the videos too!
Great video's, Really appreciate the behind the scenes footage, COYH 🖤♥️💛 🔥🔥🔥 New camera angle 👌 do miss seeing the action on the flanks though...
Do you have the Declan rice screamer saved?
Pls post video everyday. Im really exited . Love ur channel . Keep it up
Unlucky lad
More goalkeepers should do this, it's so interesting
Definitely prefer the GoPro in the back corner
gutted but we move , come on u ornnnnns 🐝🐝
🐐
Love you Ben
I prefer the other angle
‘Come on the boys’ or ‘yes the boys’ has to be said at start it every game or half. Love it Fozza.
Let’s gooo new favorite channel
And this is a great channel
❤️❤️💙💙
I'm a Birmingham city fan and I'm watching a Watford players YouTube channel
My day just got 100% better
Love cycling and love football , and these videos are very entertaining, keep it up always excited when the notification comes up 👍
i liked the old view better than this new one. Can you bring the old one back?
great video, i think i prefer the other camera angle though
Camera in the corner is better. Love your videos mate!!!
I support United but this is amazing
Great Video Ben, unlucky result lets keep our heads up and move to the next one :D
You little beauty, great content Ben as always.
You little beauty
Wonder how long before a oppo celebrates into the camera or boots it away after scoring 🤔
Soo much tomato ketchup 🤣🤣
Legend
excellent video but better angle
It was 1-1 not 2-2 haha
These videos would be so good with fans
Would it be possible to put one camera at each side? If not then i think the old angle was better
100k before November
love this series
I think your other angle is better.
The camera lense adds so much more being centre and wide angled
enjoyed the old camera angle better unfortunately. but still loving the content and insight!
This is such a great insight into the highs and lows of professional sport! Loving this series Ben!
Another great video Ben! Great role model for aspiring goalkeepers
This is a great channel.
You are very good goalkeeper, and youtuber!🔥🔥🔥👍
A soon as I saw Watford were on television, I was constant looking in the goal to see where the camera was! Keep up the good content, as a goalkeeper learning a lot from these as well as having a fun video to watch
I love this channel too much, its exactly what we all needed. Keep it up Ben👌
When fans are here it will be awesome
I love this video's! as a younger goalkeeper the coaching from Ben i can learn a lot from Ben!! Sad that goal in the extra time... keep your head up!
Keep the camera in the corner, Ben.
Loved the camera angle this video Ben! Keep up the good work!
Any chance on coming back to Birmingham ?
Were is ur diving save against solanke?
Not your fault Ben, we move on!
Nice video 👏
Inspirational.
Is it a Ben Foster video is he doesn’t get a coffee and say  “Yes then Boys” right before kick off 😂 loving the content mate keep it up
Well played Foster Camera is better in the corner of the goal Plus would love to know from the Ref why the foul a on Sarr right in the first few minutes was not a red card for the Bournemouth player as I watched the game and it should have been a red card the Bournemouth player had all his studs showing and it looked like he was out of control during the tackle.
Did you have to get permission to put a camera in the goals?
Ben Foster is a beast and a LEGEND in every way 😎👌💪🔥💯
It would be nice if you could pull the camera a little further back from the same angle.
Another great video ben
LOVE YOUR VIDS
Prefer the corner angle
Felt bad for sarr today he was brutally tackled the whole game
Love the new wide angle camera!
Still great. Because of these videos you've become my sons favourite Watford player. Ahead of Hughes and Sarr.
Love the video, but think the other camera angle is better as you can see post to post and all of ur saves, keep up the hard work COYH 🐝
This is superb, not just him giving the matchday insight but hes a top lad as well
Prefer corner angle
you need too put it behind the goal
Absolutely unlucky buddy but like you say "that's football " keep it up buddy and keep it going you'll get the win on tuesday without a doubt with hard work and determination you'll keep it a clean sheet
Best current youtuber, as a hornets fan this is sick to watch.
i did bet on a correct score 1-1 draw so it was one of the best moments of my life this year lol.
Put it back in the corner lad just abit better
I can’t be the only one that tries to find the camera on tv when he’s playing (yes ik it would be hard to see it)
Fozzy loving the vidoes  Best keeper ever  Come on you watford❤🐝🐝👍
Love the vids they make my day and I don’t even support Watford
Absolutely loving these videos ben thanks
Love the content GK
HEY BEN! LOVE THE VIDS. WHEN ARE YOU ANNOUNCING THE PEDRO SHIRT
I watched the highlights of this earlier and couldn’t wait to see your reaction for conceding that late goal Ben! 🤣, alas such is football - What did you think of Begovic’s one on one save?
Best time of the week 🙌🏼
A draw is better than a loss, Ben. You were great against Bournemouth, nothing you could do. Great content my fav youtuber
Next time will be better! Let´s go!
I’m not even a Watford fan but I love these videos Ben, nice one
dont keep it like that
Can wait to see foster against the beast
I absolutely love these videos, hope you guys you gonna promote back to the PL. Keep up the good work Ben, and best of luck. (From a Man Utd fan) :)
This is really helpful as a young keeper. Keep it up 👍👍
They should have been down to 9 men ffs
Unsure Stipe qualifies as "little" beauty
Great weather for a football match as well, you love to see it 😍
Love your channel ben .. love from india. Arsenal fan here
Keep up the great vids mate
“*whoever scored* YOU LITTLE BEAUTYYYY”
What if someone scores a goal ,steals the camera and celebrates with it
i prefer more the matchday stuff and the lifestlye rather than the go pro stuff. love the vids
Nothing better than seeing Ben Upload!
Love this ben
The wide angle lense is perfect
New subscriber here hi Ben Foster😃
What a find these videos have been!!
Hey I think the go pro in the corner is a better view but other than that amazing vid
Think the GoPro is better suited in the corner, to be honest.  Other than that, entertaining stuff as always! Would love to see you do a bit of a Q&A video in the future, a 'Keeper's Questions' so to speak.
Maybe two cams every corner one in the goalie
I love the insight and honesty this channel brings. I play for an NCAA college here in the USA, and seeing the perspective of a top professional over in the Championship is very cool to see. I try to do similar things on my channel with those interested in the college life as well. Keep up the content Ben 🙏🏼
Love the camera angle as well  Love it
2:50 Borat Foster 😂😂😂
Keep up the great work Ben! Absolutely Loving the Videos!!
Camera angle is great Ben
Great vid Ben would love a shirt 🙏🐝🐝🐝
I’ve actually been waiting for this since I saw the go pro in the goal in the highlights
top top quality
When is the Pedro shirt winner getting picked 🤞🤞
Love the channel Ben  Keep it up
This is absolutely class
Love the videos  I think the camera would be better back in the corner 👍
funny if the ball came into the net and smashed the camera 😂, nah it won’t be funny but it’s a shame y and Bournemouth got relegated I liked both the clubs  but we signed Danny wellbeck ❤️
New angle is better !
im a palace fan but ur amazing i n goal. you deserve in the EPL
Wonderful video would love to get the jersey
Couldn’t have picked a better player to be doing these videos 😂👌Ben is the most genuine and funniest player in the championship
Sorry for the loss lad keep it up
Unlucky ben Should have been a win but an unlucky draw🙌🙌🙌
it is better in the middle it will be good.if you alternate them
Question: why do you always touch the bar at kick off? Superstition or habit? Amazing content btw keep it up big man
Loving this content Ben, as a keeper myself it’s great to see! Currently making the transition into adult football and seeing how that goes!
Love the content Ben, keep it up.
Definitely keep the wide lens, great view almost part of the action!
Unlucky
Yes Ben mate another great video, love the waffling interview 😂 Shame about the last minute goal though. Quiet like the camera being in the middle of the goal than in the corner
Most underrated goalkeeper in England.
Loving the video I am a Charlton fan but find these videos so good from Wanaka NZ
Like this camera angle!
Unlucky mate but the team defended very well
Uploaded at the same time as Ben! 🤷‍♂️ All the best Football youtubers uploading at the same time 👀🤣🤥
Put it in the corny fosty
Yeah buddy another video
hi ben, link up with me when u come to bournemouth.

‘You little beauty’ every time 😂
Hi Ben how or u and  your  family

Just subscribed
Love this
Yes Ben lad when you playing coventry
Ben foster 🤝 making everyone’s 2020 better
Up the fucking cherries love these vids though
Hi Ben, I’m a Leicester fan but these videos are absolutely amazing keep up the good work, awesome keeper mate
Goal kick tutorial? 😁
I know I’m going against the grain here big man but I prefer the camera in the corner of the goal. Can see more of the action down the flanks. Otherwise great content as always and keep up the good work...👍
Hey Ben. Love this perspective to a pro footballers career. I myself am a keeper and you are an inspiration. I get so many tips from. Keep up the great work!
never stop these videos ben they are class
To be honest I think it looks better in the corner
Im an Aston Villa fan but i cant get enough of these videos! Fire 🔥   keep it up Ben!
you are by far the best keeper in the championship, from a bournemouth fan
Thanks for doing this videos . As a goalie I can learn a lot from watching you perform at professional level . Keep up the good work 💪🔝❤️
yes! yes! yes! new video.
I watched the game live and was trying to find the go pro in the net the whole time 😂😂
Really love the new Go Pro setup! Keep it up Ben!
after watching the last video I couldnt stop noticing the camera in the goal
Enough to make a grown man cry
Old angle
Angle is great, love these videos❤️

Unlucky! Not always nice to concede late on. You were quality once again Ben
As a Utd fan it's good to see Garner on this team. Top player. Top Youtube channel!

Hi Ben would you recommend a particular pair of gloves for older kids? Love the content btw.
Ngl the idea that Ben came up with to use a go pro to record him playing is sick and will inspire young goalkeepers good stuff Ben 👍
I’ve never said no to online school so quicky
Loving the videos keep it up 👍🏼 can’t wait for the stoke version of this
This is actually quality gives great insight
Hey Ben I want to say that your videoa are amazing. It's really interesting to see what is really happening on and off the pitch of a real football club! Best of luck!
