Good luck Russia. Those ADVANCED jet liners requires thousands and thousands of high-tech replacement parts and updates to keep them airworthy. You can't just fix a major fault in an engine that typically gets resolved/fixed by the manufacturer. Russia is only going to be able to cannibalize their fleets for so long. I feel bad for the flying public in Russia. Extremely dangerous.
Putin is a genius 😂
The ridiculously double stands of the West, the EU and Biden. They can seize BILLIONS and BILLONS of Russian assets, but then get in a big sulk when Russia seizes 100's of their leased large airline planes.
It’s all a con. Russia is only wanting what is legally there territory. Biden, the un , for them it’s only about money Ukraine is the corrupt to the hilt.
Thanks to the Great Leader. 😆🤣
Griner: We the People invested the wealth of this nation to ensure freedom, finances, and ALL other support for her to become the best version of herself - highest level of success.  Brittany, in response, chose to take a knee, espouse anti-American rhetoric. She deserves to be Exiled by US.
Bomb them,  OBVIOUSLY....
The BLUE-EYED BLONDE WHITE WESTERNERS really know how to take care one of their own (UKRAINE)
Humanity don’t understand this argument that an innocent kid would like to understand because is wise, otherwise something would have been done about the squandering of fortunes and the war. What can be done with the gold in reserves like in the Fort Knox in America? Only to sell it. How much cost taxpayers to protect the gold? Fortunes. To sell the gold today spares to pay for the protection tomorrow. The gold market is going to crash and i defend my word against any economist past or present. Russia could go bankrupt and end the war in Ukraine.  I think we live in an horrible world, and I was said it is the only one we have. I have to keep trying. I am not given a voice in any news media in the world.
They have plenty of planes to use for parts no problem for them, they might return them when they get there super yachts back
There might be a bigger picture we aren't seeing yet.  Putin may be trying to cut all ties with the west, no airliners, no business, no trade, nothing, nada. Then he and the Chinese can form their own world, their own universe, so to speak.  It all boils down to a choice between controlled CLOSED societies and democratic OPEN societies.  Maybe "communism" is gone, but the idea of people control, thought control, absolute control still remains. And THAT may be what putin is really after.
It's the GREEDY bastards OWN FAULT, trusting and working with Communist's! I don't care whatsoever about how much they LOSE! GREED IS ALL THEY KNOW!
Putin is making more and more enemies
How come we all talk how it's going to affect Russia's but no one talks about how it's affecting us in America
Take the lost
Start a war and you bring on such repercussions … I guess that Ukraine was a builder of Russian Aircraft in the past …
May GOD BLESS AMERICA AND THANKS FOR HELPING IN UKRAINE TO SAVE THE NATION AND TO PROTECT CIVILIAN PEOPLE OUR ALMIGHTY Father God  always Guide in Power of Goodness

World war 3 has begun and soon it'll be declared officially.
2001 Afghanistan Liberia 2003 Iraq 2004 Pakistan 2011 Libya 2014 Syria Yemen 2016 Cameroon Libya The United States has killed hundreds of thousands of civilians in the last 20 years alone. Why are you silent about this ??? did God give you the right to kill with impunity?
As Putin has confiscated these aircraft and now they are considered Russian property, why doesn’t the West reimburse the lease holders from Russian funds (frozen) held by the West?
Russian miltery should do its duty by removing putin urgently before causing greater harm.
If you don't trust your neighbor completely, never leave your personal property within their jurisdiction.
Im sure they knew that this is the cost of doing business with Russia.
A “fight between Russia and Ukraine”??? It’s a WAR!
That’s alright, Russia can’t afford to maintain them. They’ll end up killing more Russians than the Ukrainians have😂
Trust me Putin this is going to hurt you more than it hurts NATO 777
So the west seized their money and they seized the west's airplanes? Is that fair?
The collapse of "globalism"...
Bravo for putin.
They don’t care. They are already flying to Turkey and Egypt and nobody arresting aircrafts. Pegasus touristic and others have charters using Boeings “red wings” to fly to Turkey and Egypt and are planing to expand abroad within a month… they are selling tours left and right… why Boeings “red wings” have not been arrested in Egypt??
Saint Joseph terror of demons Pray for us. . .
Pls. Pray the Rosary & Devine Mercy Chaplet to free all countries from war, hunger, calamities...pls. pray for peace and joy on all families and home.
Feel the Sanction Putin!
I think those planes could still fly for years without original components or parts. Russian can make carbon copy of parts needed. Copyright violation? They dont care as long as those planes could fly.
Russian flights were blocked. Do not expect to get planes. They fly.
Well done boss.
It's time for international law to step in
All's I season a tyrant up there making them poorest decision is his life and for our country what is going on. Words can't even describe then competence of his phony presidency
The nations can do what China did:   Cut up the  Jets into  large metal  chunks, and return the garbage back to their owners.
Lol
& who siezed FIRST ?
Or could they be covered by insurance as they are essential stolen at this point? personally not overly knowledgeable on these subjects
If it is possible put all the oligarchs funds that have been siezed into a massive compound intrest account,with the intrest,pay the companies,right the planes off and move on,there is no need for a crisis at all
WHO cares about his planes
the🇺🇲 and its allies, its partners out of 🇪🇺Nato should change school programes to include teaching our kids how Ukrainian resistance defeated " 🇷🇺Z death ☠️ 💀 convoy " a brute foreign power despite the huge power imbalance !
Wasn't the potential for the Ukrainian invasion there for weeks...before Putin acted.  These Airlines had ample opportunity to stop flying into Russia and continued to do so.  Their loss is a part of doing business.  As for Insurance companies paying out...will they as this is a result of an act of war.  So in the end...passengers everywhere will be paying for Putin's Egotistical Folly.
Biden has really screwed up.
Amennnnnn
Disney Overvalued? Man I feel bad for avg investors. Insiders have know for a long time that the Disney C Suite negotiated poorly and gave CCP too much power over Board.  The failure of Disney’s  “Don’t Say Gay” campaign to prevent Fla from protecting its elementary school children from political indoctrination is not being viewed favorably in Beijing.  In light of how poorly their partner Putin’s war in UKR is going - they needed no further setbacks and Disney failed to deliver.  Word is a power demonstration is on way.  Smart investors w ears in China have already dumped the stock - considerations of Disney’s morally questionable partnership w the underwriter of the UKR invasion aside.

Loser technology has ruled Russia for over one hundred years so it is doubtful much will change over the next five years. Sounds like a disappearing dictator and food rationing around the corner and emanating from Russia outward into Libya, Egypt and Turkey which will no doubt preciptate ongoing instability resulting in numerous civilian overthrows of governments, and Russia will be included. Russia never offered solutions to problems as much as simply running interference of functioning systems and governments to become diplomatic chlamydia of the world.   If Russia is a Geo-Titanic sinking, it will take some time. Would not be surprising if Russia  gets split up into sections so like the state of California, it could become governable sometime in the future, but not for now. Caution, faminine and dissention ahead for Russia and several other countries. Putin will go down in history as a leader that was led over a cliff.
Russian aircraft industry will be a big loser in this because they have a good product with no chance to sell it now.  Insurance costs will just be passed along to consumers.  Good job 🦃s!!
This is the consequence of relying on the west, buyers beware.
Biden is a pathetic leader and is making a fool of himself in similar ways Trump did because both are narcissists and have declining neurological functions.  These airliners are being abused and we and the Russian people will suffer the costs.  Unbelievably stupid move as was attacking Ukraine.
Russia vs Ukraine
Fhck  HSA  Enemy  of Muslims
When Chelsea was seized everyone from the Worst sorry West was commended for a good job. Russia retaliates all idiots  starts analysis against Russia.
With worry and pain, we have been witnessing the events of the recent days, which have been heated up for a long time.    For a long time, Western foes and the USA have been teasing Russia from all sides to force Russia to give them literally a real fight. These are the representatives of the dark forces of the Planet, and they cannot stand the Light and New good beginnings, which are coming from the Russian leadership. Light and these New good beginnings are aliens to them. Great resources have been thrown in order to invalidate human values, all those good and light initiatives, which are coming from the leadership of our country.    DEMONIC NATURE DOES NOT MIND RESORTING TO ANY HEINOUS MEANS TO ACHIEVE ITS DIRTY AND FILTHY AMBITIONS, SUCH AS SPREADING THE ANGRIEST PROTESTS AGAINST RUSSIA, SOWING DISCORD BETWEEN NATIONS, SPONSORING SLANDEROUS ARTICLES AND THE ACTIVITIES OF THE CRAZY OPPOSITION, AMONG OTHERS.    BUT EVERYTHING HAS ITS OWN LIMIT. AND WHEN THE VESSEL OF PATIENCE AND PERSUATIONS FOR THE PEACEFUL SETTELEMENT OF OUR MOTHERLAND SECURITY MATTERS IS FULL, AMIDST ALL CONTINUING DEMONIC MANIPULATIONS, OUR PRESIDENT BRAVELY DEDICATES HIMSELF TO A STRUGGLE, NOW USING OTHER MEANS.    THIS IS NOT A WAR. THIS IS HUMANITARIAN AID TO THE WHOLE HUMANITY, WHICH HELPS TO ERADICATE EVIL, HYPOCRACY (NOW WE CAN CLEARLY SEE ALL MASKS, WHICH THE WEST HAS BEEN USING TO MASQUARADE ITS TRUE INTENTIONS TOWARDS RUSSIA), ENVY, HATRED, GREED AND GROUNDLESS CALUMNY, AT THE TRESHOLD OF THE TRANSITION INTO THE NEW DIMENTION OF OUR BEING. THE LIST OF THE MEANS OF THE DEMONIC NATURE, WHICH HIDES ITS TRUE INTENTIONS UNDER THE MASKS OF “KINDNESS” CAN BE CONTINUED. Their will is to stop the stream of fresh and pure flows of Love and Truth to enter human hearts. Their will is to fill the Planet with darkness and gloom of their selfish theories.   BUT TRUTH IS ONE!!!! AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH DEMONS ARE MOCKING RUSSIA, OUR SPIRIT WILL MAKE THEM PAY THE ULTIMATE PRICE FOR ALL THEIR DEEDS. AND ALL THOSE, WHO SUPPORT THEM THIS HOUR WILL FACE A SPECIAL KARMIC RETRIBUTION. ALL LIGHT FORCES OF THE UNIVERSE SUPPORT NEW RUSSIA AND OUR PRESIDENT, WHO IS THE ONLY ONE FROM BILLIONS ON EARTH, WHO HAS RISEN UP TO DEFEND HUMAN VALLUES. MAY THE DIVINE PRINCIPLE OF THE CREATOR PROTECT HIS EVERY STEP AND EVERY DECISSION. THE PLANET WILL BECOME THAT PURGATORYM, WHICH THE DARK FORCES HAVE BEEN PUTTING TEMSELVES TO.    TONIGHT IS A SPECIAL NIGHT, THE NIGHT OF GOD, WHO DESTROYS IGNORANCE. MAY THIS ERADICATION OF THE HUMAN IGNORANCE AND HUMAN BLINDNESS BECOME THAT SIGNAL, WHICH THE PLANET AND THE UNIVERSE HAVE BEEN YEARNING FOR.  01.03.2022-02.03.2022
Well, who's surprised?! Russian government is a cluster of international CRIMINALS. UKRAINE has been screaming this for years!
When nato and their alllies ATTACk all over the middle East so why what to the so called organization from West like HUMAN RIGHTS & UNSC 😂😂😂 joke after joke and the puppet of west were was all gone at that time so for E.U & WEST it was all right to attack in middle East right it is for no doubt IRONY WITH DOUBLE STANDARD BEING WEST. 😂😂😂   IF WEST ATTACK ANY COUNTRY IN THE NAME OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS THAN ITS ALL GOOD IF ANY ITHER COUNTRY WHO CHALLENGES THE WEST THAN ITS ACT OF TERROR AND THREATS FOR THE WEDT SECURITY 😂😂 PUPPETS IN E.U WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND BY THIS WAR ONLY ONE COUNTRY IS BEING PROFITED AND THAT'S USA THE ARMS BUSINESS. ALSO COMPARING TO MIDDLE EAST ITS NOTHING COMPARELESS TO RUSSIAN IN UKRAINE.  AND THE COUNTRY WHOS BEING MEAN TO RUSSIA AS IF PUTIN DID ATTACK THE 100 COUNTRY AT ONCE SO THERES ALL THE WEST & E.U ARE POINTING FINGERS TO RUSSIA 😂😂 PITY ON THEM STILO LOVES TO TAKE RUSSIAN OIL & GAS SO AS WEST BY TAKING URANIUM BY RUSIAN BUT STILO ACT LIKE WEST IS GOOD BOY AND RUSSIA IS BAD BOY DONT WORRY TIME WILL SAYS EVERYTHING.  NO MATTER WHAT SOON OR LATER THE PROPAGANDA FROM WEST WILL SHALL SPEAK THE TRUTH ITSLEF.  ALSO IT WAS NATO WHO EXPANDED THE TERRITORY TOWARDS THE RUSSIAN BORDER SO IN RETURN WHAT MORE YOU THINK OF GETTING BACK. 😂😂  #SLAVA #RUSKI  LONG LIVE RUSSIA AND INDIA AND THE RISE OF EAST ERA HAIL @PUTIN.
Good putin ❤️
And that's why you have kill switches.
Every steps Gets American president Joe Biden to harsh Russia, hits back to American life and euo... Many believe it's the time Biden to step down, not Putin to step down
EVEN IF  PUTIN IS DISPOSED OR ......... THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE AS A WHOLE, CAN NO LONGER TRUST THE WEST EVEN BY A CENTIMETRE !
TOO MANY UNFAIR SANCTIONS BECAUSE THE USA WANTS TO MURDER NOT ONLY PUTIN BUT THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE !!!
Seizure my a…Sanctions banned them from leaving…
Duh sanctions kept them from leaving…
'Lies Exposed & Truth Revealed" is a must read for all Christians along with your Bibles

Just use foreign Russian funds seized in the west to bail out the companies. That way it'll be as if they purchased the aircraft.

Gogogo Russia🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺👍👍👍
Russian  need to ban all-gas in the whole world
What this means is China shouldn't buy 4000 new aircraft from the west because they are not reliable partners, they need to ramp up their own aircraft production.
Russia = stupid f@٪&king decision starting a war. I.E..., what you see right here.
Польша Украина соседи России, у них будут хорошие отношения с Россией. Вместо этого они работают над реализацией далекого американского плана. Какие действия предпримет Россия в Америке, если рядом с Америкой врубится Канада???
Wher are they going to fly the aircraft if all the nations don't allow them into their airspace?
We keep their yachts and they keep the airplanes...good trade?....Don't know but if the west doesn't sell Russia any parts for the aircraft then they got the planes for scrap metal use later.....The longer they keep the aircraft, the bigger their lease rent goes....just keep piling the lease payments on. If and when things get back to "normal" they will have to pay the bill.
Well how much of Russian money was seized. I'm not a smart man but if one government can do that then they should be able to get there money threw that
America is a big declining joke ... China 🇨🇳 India 🇮🇳  and Russia 🇷🇺 the future 🍸🍸🍸 from Jamaica with love
Does the United States consider Asia belligerent? 3.8 million Vietnamese were killed by the United States. 200,000 Japanese were massacred by the American atomic bomb in one minute. One million Iraqis and Afghans were killed by the United States.
PUTIN'S ORDER COMES INTO FORCE ON MARCH 31! Who wants Russian gas, pays in rubles .... Who won't, and doesn't have to ... here's American gas .. It is not legal to change the provisions of the contract on the change of the currency of payment, .... well, your sanctions are not legal either ...!?

Try to manufacture parts themselves yo
western media is funny...just like sunctions in 2014 you al sayed russia will not be able to come back after the sunction and due to that it was able to be independent of food prodaction and many other areas and this is what you all agree ..also in 2015 when russia went to syria you also sayed the war will shoe how poor the russia army but we all agree they have done agood job.It will not suprise me to see you guys reporting after 2 years how the russia economy is doing well ..remember this plain parts you are talking about only need time for russia to develop .
I wonder, who's gog and magog now in this war?!
It's good one
I'm sure that governments who froze Russian central bank assets, can hold hearings on creating a payment structure of restitution based on persona non grata on writ of habius corpus to sue Russia and get full price for nationalized assets.  Surprised the oil and gas companies in Venezuela didn't seek this sort of recompensation when they got nationalized.  Same with Iran.
Russians are liable.
🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩👍🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺💪✌
Old greedy man
THE TERMINAL CLOSE BECAUSE OF THE IDIOT HIM MUS GO PRISON
THEM MUST CEIZED HIS PROPERTY HIM TOO WICKED
Although Russia is a super power they can't reject the world wide opinion.
Let me get this straight , so it's okay for the US and NATO to freeze aka steal Russian assets but when Russia does it it's a crime? The hypocrisy never ceases to amaze me.
So u think Russia really cares about how you feel at the moment? When you guys were confiscating properties of Russia billions wasn't is sweet? No ur own businesses are dead for life. So feel the impact also
INOVATIONS happen from desperate situations ...
Rasia know Very well
LEARN THIS ONCE FOR ALL. NEVER DO BUSS WITH RUSSIANS. SONER OR LATER YOU GET BUSTED
Let’s go brandon
Airlines should permanently ban Russia from their destinations.
No pay for loss due to act of war in all  insurance policies.  So this is a debt that the people who pay taxes now owe.
Putin is playond ''command&conquer''  pc game non stop
BIDEN MUST LET VOLODÍMIR ZELENSKY TO QUIT IN UKRANIA FOR UKRANIANS LIFES AND FOR PEACE OF WORLD ‼️ THIS WAR IS FOR ENERGETICS AND IS NOT FOR REALLY HELP TO UKRANIA ‼️
Those who love war kill people to show their power are the mentally  ill they don't know how to live in peace all those sick people had to go get treatment faster
⚡️ Putin 2006 https://youtu.be/hQ58Yv6kP44
The NATO pushed the green button. the wrong one. be prepared to push the red one.
Not one plane will leave Russian airspace as it will be immediately confiscated
The Russian president don't deserve to have nothing you don't even deserve to be alive that piece of s*** peace to Ukraine
Pro Russia 💯
Only talk that's Biden style nothing will happen help is needed in Ukraine not talk see the Polish Swedish and ukrain how they have kept Russia in check not America

We all prevent this since 1949 , why would you think WW3 is far from your house . We all effectiom awful . Biden is worse president and he always a liar
Take the 10 Billion out of Putin's  Treasure Chest,Put stiffer sanctions on the Biggest Russian Banks to cut off Putin's Cash flow.
SLAVA UKRAINI! putin THE WAR CRIMINAL!  The GENOCIDAL xi, china & the ccp SUPPORTS putin! U.S. & Allies should hunt down, any regime helping putin & russia on  sanctions-LIKE china & ccp!  IMPOSE SECONDARY SANCTIONS ON THEM AS WELL!  Supporters of evil should suffer the same fate!
He should NEVER let back Russia back into the Western economy. We keep trusting them and for what? They always how their true colors.
Putin is a Great leader and he is doing good .
Russia will win
Please please forgive me for bothering your personal life I want to return Russia second writing  So you can have happy life again
The aircraft will soon stop being repaired and will not be suitable before flights. And in order not to visit my mother by train, it will take 14 days😹🥲
Please make subtitles in Russian. Since Russia has been closed by independent media
I want to thank the whole West. Now our aviation plant in Voronezh (Russia) will be loaded with orders for IL-96.
I will explain  further. Russia does not have to pay for seized aircraft. The default will be on US Banks. You cant just sell an aircraft you must have all its maintenance records to determine safety. If not its a full strip down inspection MILLIONS of dollars. You now have surplus aircraft you must sell into a market that does not want them. Boeing will have to contend with no new sales as second hand aircraft are available CHEAPER. Another nai in Boeings collapse. LETS GO BRANDON 😭
Lol that's what the west get for confiscating Russian things
All the ill informed comments below Russia and China have no technology no aircraft industry. Shows how effective US Propaganda has been Russia prepared they're in a happy place Europe just cut its self off under threats from America form all its resources for production. America buys Gas from Russia then sells it as FREEDOM Gas. The years of disinformation by the US MSM have left all of America blind to the reality Russia could have been a great friend and tried for decades. America's need for enemies to bankroll its WAR ECONOMY is your downfall and Putin the worlds most respected and intelligent leader handed you a gun you put to your own head. How do you all plan to get out of this over 9000 sanctions world wide on countries you now beg to help you and you cant take their assistance without admission your sanctions were illegal from the start and remove them .
every commercial aircraft 'stuck in Russia' has already lost its International Air Worthiness Certificate (IAWC). Thus the aircraft is worthless (and uninsurable) outside of Russian airspace. Pretty soon no Russian commercial pilot will be willing to get into a cockpit. Also, who is going to pay all the ATC's, baggage handlers, refuelers, technicians, etc. The invasion has set Russian commercial aviation back 50 years.
Boeing already in severe distress now finds the European market in turmoil banned from short routes over Russia many will collapse. Boeing orders will cease. Russia a major supplier of HIGH TECH titanium alloy components to Boeing and the 🕎S military has cut the supply meaning no construction or parts for repairs. They will take years to resource from other suppliers. This is probably the last of the  Boeing Aircraft Company due to American stupidity and war mongering. Russia and China both have domestic Aviation manufacturing facilities meaning the China market with hundreds of Boeing aircraft ordered every year is totally lost. All to prop up an illegal NAZI run regime in Ukraine. The coming exposes by Russia on US influence peddling corruption and money for the families of Biden Romney Pelosi and others will probably end all their careers. Hunter Biden has already been exposed as a major player in ILLEGAL Bioweapons labs in Ukraine illegal under US and International law ownership already admitted to by Nuland and others.
No insurance would give the claims.  It's a force majuere. No one wins in a war.  It is always the innocent that pays.  Individual or corporates. I hope a peaceful settlement would come soon.
"70% of the Russian commercial jets in service come from the Western companies." - Western lessors will soon replace them with the other countries like Western countries, Asia, Latin America and Africa
This was started by the west when they seized Russian foreign assets. They brought this on.
never seen the USA president, speaker, vice president Senate acting this low.
Biden must pay for this its very easy and fast just put more paper in to the copy dollars machine is so simple!
Stop War Pray for Peace!
No matter what cost - we cannot do business with NKWD or fascist. BAN RUSSIA EWERYWHERE.
Russia may hold those planes today, but see if Russia can lease future planes! LOL Talking about bad credit!
sanctions is mean push Russia using nuclear weapons       so all countries in the world should not support EU and USA's sanctions because all country in world they got bad results for their economic especially oils (Gasoline) it increase the price not only that    but no stock enough in some countries
Beijing Biden has provoked & killing millions
Without factory support from Boeing or Airbus the Russian aircraft mechanics won't be able to keep them airworthy. And if they get pirated parts from China all bets are off because we know the quality involved there.
they've already seized multiple yachts from their Oligarchs, sell them off and payoff the airlines lessors
Perhaps the insurance could recoup some of their loses by tapping into Putin's massive assets.  Just a thought.
stop Bermuda from doing flying with Russia its not their airspace
Cannibalizing the aircraft, huh.....
Government support?! You mean corporate welfare!
' much of those planes'   ???   Your  script writer needs to feed the AI  voice a better diet.
every one of those aircraft are insured against theft and other ancillary or incidental damages, including insurrection. SO.....the leasing companies are out nothing.  FAKE NEWS!!!!  The real loser here is Putin as he won't be able to get support to get them all running again, or get parts to repair them after they have been sitting for months.  They will clog up his airports, runways and hangers.  Furthermore, nor will they get certified to fly over controlled airspace without that certification.   Shame on you WSJ for this false reporting.
I'm not surprised Putin stole billions of dollars worth of western airplanes. He's a tyrannical dictator with delusions of grandeur, and nothing is beyond his meddling.
It's gonna get bad real real bad..get right with God.
Hmm I
hmm
Putin must give back the planes or eurmope will block all russuan mone
Putin is pushing back Russia at least 30 years.  Somebody has to get Putin out from within, do not see how they can let one man make their whole country a rogue nation.
This places Russia on the naughty list for the leasing companies.  If you think a bad credit score is bad, try theft of rental equipment on your credit report.  Lease was not renewed and they are keeping the aircraft?  Not a smart move for your future, Russia.
In mercy God will take away the things of this world that you love the most in order to save you. Many will not get the message and be lost to the calamities that is to consume the world soon. We love the things of this world more than we love our Creator. Souls are perishing because they have no hope. The parents are lost therefore the children are lost. We live in a "Me, Myself, and I" society. You may find comfort in the luxuries of this world but what will you fall back on when all that you love is stripped and taken from you?  Mark 8:36-37 [36]For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?  [37]Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?   Psalms 49:6-8 [6]They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; [7]None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him: [8](For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)  Jesus came to save you and he loves you. All he ask is that you trust him and be obedient to his commandments. He came to give life but Satan has tricked many into thinking that they can find life in the praise of others. Be not deceived the time is close at hand. God will not be mocked for much longer. Accept pardon for your sins and be cleansed in the blood of Jesus Christ the lamb of God. You have a need for a Saviour and this is why he came. I love you all and so does Jesus. Peace and Blessings be upon you.
As Biden is saying Putin can’t stay in power, let’s remember how many times Obama said the same about Syria’s Assad, but they never acted, and never meant anything… Obama on Syria: Assad Must Go | Wilson Center

Good day to you all, we are corporate charity organisation from Europe, due to the ongoing Russia invasion to Ukraine, we have so many refugee here in our camp and we can not do this alone and we are soliciting for individual support, nothing is too small to save life..you can contact us on how you can support this people via crypto currency.... Thanks let save life
i will be forever indebited to you Stephanie and this channel 😇you have changed my whole life i will continue to preach your name for the world to hear that you have saved me from huge financial debt with just little investment thank you very much Mrs ,Stephanie Vincent.
Russia is not going to return any of those planes, and no courts can order them. To return them back to the rightful owners, because they have seizure billions of dollars in values. For the Russian government, so they are going to hold onto all of those planes.So what that guy is saying,it is a done deal ok
Putin cazy man
Listen to the guy from  Greech who thinks deplaomacy is the only way forward.  But easiler said when he sits on the bleakers
Most all types of insurance have a "war" exclusion, the losses are a result of war.
What that guy is saying about the aircraft carriers them,it is going to caused negative effects. On all of the countries them and, even if they passed on the cost to the insurance companies. Their insurance is going to go up, because Russia is not giving them back those planes at all. The western countries them,does not want the war to finish at all.Else they wouldn't be sending weapons to  Ukraine at all.The sanctions is affecting the entire world,it is not only Russia it is causing at all.
When the war gets over Russia pays to rebuild Ukraine not America. Russia
The WSJ??? haha yes indeed.
10 billion per plane or 10 billion for the whole thing?
Top 5: Bad Things to be with a RUSSIAN WOMAN... https://youtu.be/YSZ0VvFbu24
You sanction them, and it will hurt you, no doubt about that. I see nukes flying,  cause, AMERICA AND UK
I'm sure it's a very simplistic view of the economics here, but if the planes are worth 10B and they're insured for 15B, isn't someone stealing 5B from someone?  Regardless if Russia steals all the planes or not.
West support ukranian Azov nazis
There are rumors that the Russian secret services in a closed meeting yesterday, could be planning to depose Putin in the middle of the war. For isolating Russia from the rest of the world and committing atrocities against Ukraine.
As soon as they land in a foreign country they should seize them, like they have down for a few cargo planes.
Zelensky will be the upcoming president of New Ukraine(Ukraine + Russia, Russia will be absorbed)
So the American War machine is in full effect. Thanks, Joe.
Airbus and Boeing need US spare parts so yeah building own planes and not relying on US airplanes companies despite might be unprofitable its not a bad idea
These planes are staying their for a reason. Putin is out for blood. To send your troops to kill innocent is a crime in itself. Its murder. His troops are programmed to obey orders. The people around him are programmed to obey his orders. Follow your commander he says. SMH. I was in the ARMY many years ago and was NEVER ordered to induce harm on the innocent. There is no reason for his actions. There will only be more death. And on top of that people need to STOP saying Russians this and Russians that. This is how they are programmed to be. THEY ARE FOLLOWING THEIR COMMANDER WHICH IS WHAT THEY ARE TOLD TOLD TOLD TO DO AND IF THEY DONT THEY ARE THREATENED WITH HARSE REPROCUTIONS TO INCLUDE DEATH!!!! I understand this statement is a little off topic but bottom line, these plains are being held for a reason. And it isnt a good one. Its more than just money. With what has happened in the past with planes being used as projectiles into sky scrapers, not recalling specific events, the threat from Putin not many years ago of a so called invisible nuclear weapon that could potentially impact U.S. or any countries livelihood, we have now given this man an arsenal of civilian planes that can be used for a means of destruction or retreat of his people as he says. They need to be decommissioned permanently regardless of the money to be lost. Not safe in the hands of Putin by any means. Just my opinion. You dont like it oh well. Freedom of speech. Im not controlled like his people that wont speak against him.
Beatween Russia And west .. Rusia is east ?
Isolate Russia (Putin) to the whole world, until they starve to death!
the west freeze Russian assets so Russia will confiscate what belong to west, fair game.

Get all that money seized from the Russian Oligarchs to cover the losses of these commercial aircrafts… Simple…
https://youtu.be/e5fz6sOVv0g
This is a blessing in disguise for the Russian Civil Aviation. They will now concentrate on building passenger jets again and they have a 10 billion dollar worth of models to follow for technical specs.
It is better to consider the russian market inexistent from hereon out. And more, it is better to keep an eye out for anyone attempting to deal there regardless, and be ready to fine them into nonexistence if need be.
planes fly in Russia without any problems, and we don't want to fly to the madmen in Europe ourselves. Europe is suffering huge billion-dollar losses, all the planes that are leased are in Russia and Russia will not give them away. We fly them and we will fly them.
в России летаю самолеты без проблем,  а лететь к сумасшедшим в Европу мы сами уже не хотив.

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus <3
Russia will pay for everything !!! Shame on Russia !!!
US using sanctions and petrol dollars as a weapons against anyone who disobey US and NATO wish.
Ever need to wrap up a plandemic .War works every time
Russia should feel as much pain as the Ukrainians.
These sanctions will fireback soon Americans think they can sanctions whoever thay want
So because he started a war he justified stealing planes
💪🇷🇺
At first, the sky was closed for flights of Russian Airlines. Then the countries with closed skies demanded their planes back. How to return planes if they are forbidden to fly?
Having taken thing from there people just because there Russian justifies there action in my point of view
Global companies and insurance giants take a hit. It makes headline news and they get sympathy. Then the governments bail them out. Corporate heads get massive bonuses for how they saved their respective companies. Then the little guy spends the next 20 years paying for it.
Putin is way ahead of them. Now NATO, back off and stop the wealth by stealth.  Putin warned you
Небесен Отец на най-висшето небе, моля те, прости ми всичките ми грехове.  Създай в мен ново сърце, ново творение, ново раждане.  Моля те, обитавай в сърцето ми, напиши своите закони и воля в сърцето ми.  Помогни ми да ходя по Твоите пътища на святост и правда.  (Отидете и се потопете в езеро с вода и смирено ги кажете на Господ Бог Исус и Господ Исус ще ви изпрати дар, Святия Дух) Святият Дух ще ви научи, ще ви напътства в пътищата на Господ Исус.  Благословен да бъде Господ Бог Исус.

this war affect the business es of so many companies😢
Traded boats for planes haha
Insurance will just say no
15 Billion?  What are you Wall Street Journal making big beng about 15 Billion frozen in Russia and not loosing a word about *300 Billion West stolen from  Russia* short after Feb 24th?!
So that $10bn gone.😂😂
To what purpose the US freezes Russia assets anyway?
Planes will crash and people will die because lack of parts.
Senile Biden should pay...
Biden can compensate
Biden  a fool.
Is Ukraine worth it?
russia just nationlized all the planes so they are SovJets now
Why are you guys reporting on this? The financially wealth ppl are losing money? Remember the poor. This video is falling on deaf ears with the poor just looking for food.
Was Iraq war legal or illegal..?
That story doesn't look like an economic surge
Nice
If Ukraine follows Russia, will the war end?
and you seem to be using England as an aircraft carrier
why are many of YOUR jets in FRANKFURT?
nol çəkə .
The rich can lived with sanctions, the poor suffered from sanctions. Thank You President Biden for your kind consideration to the poor and the rich are forever grateful to you for making them richer
Since Everybody Is Seizing Everything They May As Well Issue " Letters of Marque" And Offer "Prize Money" For The Peoples Support Cut Them In
GOD BLESS RUSSIA!  VIVA RUSSIA!  GLORY TO RUSSIA!
If I’d realized this was from WSJ, I wouldn’t have even started watching it. Just another lie machine.
The Wall Street Journal cooperates with Procter & Gamble in the field of advertising. But Procter & Gamble has not yet stopped trading in Russia, in fact financing the killing of children by planes and tanks in Ukraine! It's money in the blood!
**~~~>>>RUN POOTBOY RUN<<<~~~!!!**
I served in the Balkans with Russians. They were known to be drunk in public. Wearing mixed uniforms from 2 or three different countries. They smelled awful and begged to trade equipment. They hadn't been paid in months  They were known by all the countries present as being the "bums" of the base. I knew  right away that the fresh never worn uniforms  and equipment we seen in the Georgia and Crimea conflict  were nothing but propaganda. Everyone has built up this image of a 7' Russian soldier that is undefeatable, when in reality anyone with real life personal experience with their military will tell you they are undisciplined drunks with terrible equipment and tactics

So Putin stole billions of dollars worth of airplanes.  How did he get away with that?
If you are stupid enough to still be flying to Russia as a Western airline carrier you deserve to have your aircraft taken.
This sanction defiantly cause harms to domestic aviation industry, even the "life line" in Russia. But, this effect takes too long to save Ukraine. The best way is seize all Russia Oligarch's abroad estate immediately. Also, put more pressure on China, even launch more "chip sanctions" toward China, destroy their semiconductor industry to have their technology back to world war 2. We really don't need Putin and CCP in this world.
Edgator very much problum
Stay Trum towel everything is ok
Do not worry Biden still has checks.
If you invest in Russia don´t worry about your losses just thank God you got out alive. If you  invest in Russia then you obviously have more money than brains!
wait a second when you break contract, with stopping  to supply  parts or services you agreed  from there you can not  recover you gave up on the planes  someone lying here
They haven't seized the jets. They just aren't allowed to fly them anywhere because nobody wants to receive a Russian flight now.
When government talks, that only lead to more deaths
Ohhhh no.. an authoritarian state won’t play the capitalism game?? Hahaha
And while WE are paying 💰 35% higher prices…Russia is at about 7%.    So, you tell me if this is working?  More than likely it’s from Covid that Russia looks effected at all.  They still have to worlds highest GDP.
USA starts war. It's fine. Russia starts war. Wait, it's illegal!
Why was Biden talking to the 82 airborne Military command unit. Is he sneak them into the Ukraine then they wear Ukrainian Uniform and attack those nuke plants to Blow them up just to start WW3. Sneaky Joe a Nazi member hiding in plain site. Biden talking Nuke Pelosi talking  Nuke is that a msg to the Azov Nazi Military in the Ukraine. Think on that.  Have a great day.
a) Write off or b) negotiate with Western politics getting compensated from Russian financial reserves, frozen and under control of Western central banks
Good luck getting spare parts and maintenance for these planes. Taking a flight is like playing russian roulette.
@Wall Street Journal no they arent
This is one of those rare instances I think a government bailout would be pretty justified. Having an aggressive foreign state seize your property seems like a pretty clear, not at fault, circumstance that deserves a different approach to helping recover losses.  Then again, when the average citizen is screwed & could benefit from some modicum of understanding, credit companies & lenders are hardly willing to take circumstance into account to help them, so not exactly sure.
Send in Randell (Memphis )Raines and the crew they get the planes back .
the correct number is 520 airplanes
What “Western partners”? That ended when the collective West waged unprovoked war on Russia. The least Russia can do is keep the planes.
and renTing pLanes was gooDway to launDer money 🤑....,
The westen started robbing Russia assets around the world. So remember one thing the private property will not be protected in the Western world and  Switzerland is not neutral.
What is 400 planes stucked by Putin of only $10 billion to a thousand Russian planes stuck in a whole wide world with hundred biillion dollar loss to Russia.
MESSAGE TO JOE BIDEN AND ALL LEADERS AND MINISTERS REPUBLICANISMS THAT OCCUPY TRUSTED POSTS.  A sword ⚔️ Unsoncreen has been left to the American people in two Vosos. On the one hand, the United States is very concerned about the internal affairs of countries that do not submit: but on the other side we are seeing them the rest of their lives under the great imminent crisis created by these terrorists commercially speaking so that the dollar 🇺🇸 has become da And it has undertook the United States 🇺🇸 in an abyss which no wealthy can solve this scareful and terrible crisis. Floods, massacres, shootings, fires 🔥 Natural disasters, increasing debts, the great defeat of the United States 🇺🇸 in Afghanistan 🇦🇫, the Great River of Immigrants, the crises of unemployment and Tor To the blame of who all this? No doubt that it is completely caused by Nazi republicanisms under global warming through Fraking. This must be reported to all people around the world 🌎. We understand very well because rivers of immigrants in the United States 🇺🇸 is because the United States does not cease to grow to the countries supposedly allied of them, they have them violated, restricted, friz, cloud And the world should be released from the coin that ulives the Wachington D.C elite. Which has blackmailed and has attacked the peoples of the world to make economic damage. However, as immigrants do not agree with their open internedist politicians have become against immigrants, and have trampled the vote of US citizens, their votes have been denied and invalid from Joe B They are the republicanisms who will impose presidents and leaders at their cravings. This issue is in the hands of Joe Biden if this finite human being precede the voton of the third world war will upload the price of oil which we have never seen from then. Gasoline, natural gas and electric light; These three main ones will be severely affected. The devil is at home and has tormented Washington DC, with earthquake and disgusting political storm. Each one devestant for his right according to the law. The most violent and rebellious nation on our planet Earth is without a doubt; The United States of North America. To understand this we have to return to investigate the emergence and stories of that nation. The committed and threats of the previous republicanisms.  (Carter) and his threats; 1 El Salvador, Guatemala, Angola, Afghanistan. (Clinton) Iraq, Sudan, Rwanda, Balkans. (George H W Buch) Soviet Union, Somalia, Panama. (George W BUCH) Iraq, Afghanistan. (Obama) Libya Syrya Yemen Afghanistan Ukrania.  Can the United States unite those who have divided? Oven not. Who is isolated to who? Who is dividing who? Who is tasting who? Can the United States remain standing at this crisis? Oviously no. What is the result of all this? The Great River of Immigrants who enter the United States No one can stop; Neither wall, or migration, nor military with all its elements, nor any other human being can stop this, besides the United States has become slaves of China and Russia. The current moment is of overwhelming interest for all republicanisms that occupy trusted posts, the republicanisms have chosen the most violent man that had never been since the foundation of the United States of North America. Thinkers of all classes and groupings as (www.LouchePac.com) (Larouche Pac in Spanish.) They have a fixed attention in the events that they themselves have produced in our thing. They observe the relationships that exist between the nations, they observe the intention that seizes all earthly element and recognize that this crisis rapidly evil worse, one after another and never cease until the time of the end. I ask: How do we know? For its fruits we will know them. Republicanisms have violated the freedom of election and freedom of conscience and human rights: Joe Biden has never won since by his attitude we identify him and his spirit of hatred and war against all; He is a hypocrite and dual-morable dictator and has passed through this world's judge and has tried to trample the OAS and all those who do not submit; Joe Biden is Adolf Hitler himself in our days called Nazi. Republicans never and never recognize their carriages as rebels and transgressors of all laws that are the fundamental basis of the nation. In the White House there is no democracy, I confirm it and denounced it. American democracy is completely erroneous and false, we have to be stupid and foolish to believe those leaders called "republicans" who are sitting within Washington DC. The United States represents ancient Babylonians, the nation of confusion. "Woe to the United States because it has a short time." One asks: When did this crisis began? On September 11, 2001, will this crisis recover in any time to come? Nooo ... !!! On the contrary, I will go from bad to worse, how do we know? For his attitude and the questions that make the candidates "there is no doubt". The United States of North America are judged by the world itself. The world knows very well that the United States is the one that generates all kinds of criminal group and Protestants who oppose violating all laws should be understood that they are used as a shield and cannon meat for American republicanisms As well as Americans have violated, not only the amendments of the Constitution, but also, international laws. This is the typical US policy and its recipes. It comes the worst scary and terrible crisis; Increasing debts, shootings, fires, war, killings, unemployment, criminal groups, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, natural desatures, floods, droughts, diseases as a result of hydra fracture These must be denounced to every human being around the world, the guilty and transgressors must be denounced and judged by Haver contaminated to our planet Earth, and by their acts and crimes and violation of laws. Republicanisms are a shame to everyone which we call interventionists, double moral, protectionism, separatists, fackey, genocidal, racist and have unleashed an economical gerra everywhere and this is against themselves their own sanc I ask, will these go wells all over the world? According to the Law Joe Biden is sentenced to death for averting the laws and for award past average of the law. That says the law. Copy and paste.
FJB
I support economic action against Russia but when all these businesses leave the country, and the West puts sanctions on Russian banks & financial institutions, it really ultimately only hurts the Russian citizens who have no voice or say in the war.
Parts can be copied, Russia is not some backward African country.
Sanctions are only hurting usa #FJB
Leases contain terms that include war as aspects that are not an insurance event. Same with real estate. These would be write offs, not an insurance.
I can’t believe this❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Putin is not attacking Ukrainians but to Us Nato for intimidat8ng russia territories
Oh better yet! By all that is HOLY, put Bernie Sanders in the presidency before all is lost.
Please put Bernie Sanders in the president position before all is lost!!!
Way she goes
can you imagine the global depression if China decided to invade Taiwan
seems like sanctions are hurting western companies also
Look how childish this has become and it's the people suffering not the government! Oh the poor people are suffering more than anything not the filthy rich.
I didnt realize they stopped making passenger jets, they had pretty good passenger planes
*Well, this is a hard lesson learned from doing business with an authoritarian country ruled by a kleptocratic gang of thugs.*
Funny how there's a ''Russia and The West.'' World is globe as we all know, well most of us apparently.. The West can be The East as well. Some of my dead braincells just awakened so carry on :D
That is the best they can do..   talk a lot of cr…ap.   They have never heard the proverb that says “ if you bark too much you are a chihuahua “. Lo lol lo

And where must all those planes flight to mister Putin? They will never be allowed in most countries, a fleet without a destination.
The fact that we get free videos on YouTube by Wall Street Journal is truly a gift.  👍
Good the Oligarchs will revolt sooner than later☠️😈🐊💰💰💰💰♠️👺🇬🇦🇬🇦🙏🙏
Biden needs to tell Putin hey we are coming for our jets and if you don't like it to bad

nothing to worry about                     America will still print a couple of bucks to buy a couple of planes, but what about Europe? Europe will borrow money from its master, I mean that the master of Europe is America. ordinary classic.
GOOD! Screw the West!
They will be able to leave. He cannot just sign into law. However, if I believed that, it might be because other reasons, not leader or nation sanction. How would western own eastern ? It's a mess

A whole bunch of planes they can’t maintain or upkeep or fly let them keep them .......idiots
Idiots should have got their planes at first sign of war but upsetting current income and future income was just to great a risk. You gambled, you lost.
The West will never get those Planes back they are belong to Putin now lol
I'm sure it's a very simplistic view of the economics here, but if the planes are worth 10B and they're insured for 15B, isn't someone stealing 5B from someone?  Regardless if Russia steals all the planes or not.

Good video!
Russia WILL FINISH THE OPERATION IN UKRAINE WHEN IT DESTROYS NAZISM .YOUR MEDIA DOESN 'T TELL YOU ABOUT IT .ABOUT THE REASONS FOR THIS OPERATION . BIDEN PUMPED UKRAINE WITH WEAPONS, WANTS TO ARRANGE ANOTHER LIBYA SYRIA IRAQ
The Implications of the U.S. allowing Putin to do this is going to be Devastating to the Whole World..But Biden even SAID  it's a New WORLD ORDER ...So there you have it !!! START HOARDING NOW!!!!
I'm wondering about the affect on the "Space" endeavors shared with Russians?
Россия ЗАКОНЧИТ ОПЕРАЦИЮ В УКРАИНЕ КОГДА УНИЧТОЖИТ НАЦИЗМ .ВАМ ОБ ЭТОМ НЕ ГОВОРЯТ ВАШИ СМИ .ОБ ПРИЧИНАХ ЭТОЙ ОПЕРАЦИИ . БАЙДЕН НАКАЧАЛ УКРАИНУ ОРУЖИЕМ ,ХОЧЕТ УСТРОИТЬ ОЧЕРЕДНУЮ ЛИВИЮ СИРИЮ ИРАК
America is stealing alot from Russia why can't Russia steal some stuff too.
China can reverse engineer and make knock off parts.
Your nation thanks you for your sacrifice.
it is very simple.. The Russians are going to nationalize all the airplanes, and other assets. they can do that under the emergency war laws .
Get into maintenance mode and delete all software in the planes ground them all.
lol
Who cares about 400 Commercial airplane ?? Let him keep them ..wonder how he plans to hide this from the Russian people who are leaving, or attempting to leave Russia by the thousands. The 82nd has been deployed to Poland which borders the war zone...that's what Putin should be worried about and trust and believe it's not for humanitarian purposes. That is not their speciality , they are the best of the best, trained killers under the worst of conditions .
Ok find a way to scramble the software make the planes on flyable
How can Putin be a thug…….he is too. Small….!
The problem with all this situation is that the West is not really in control. Russia is too big and relies on its commercial ties with China and India. Biden may believe he's the most powerful man in the world, but actually... he's not. Nobody knows how and when this whole mess will end.
Should have got them out of Russia when you had a chance
Lol Putin won’t be around much longer Russian people getting angry there learning the truth children are dying an learning war is easy way to steal money out of economy Putin became wealthy from war he’s ripping of his own people he wears designer suits an best of everything an people start opening his eyes , an to put another trail on the Russian activist the guy who wanted putins job just got another 89 years slapped on his sentence , he has to do 189 years in jail before release,, wat a joke Putin is finished
This is what these idiots get for leasing planes to despotic countries the likes of Russia, China, and Iran.  Despots will take whatever they want and will imprison anyone who objects.  Good luck getting any justice from the court system that is controlled by these despots.

it is a fight between the FREE WORLD and russia. Not the "west" and russia. In the 21st century countries like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan value their sovereignty. It is archaic to use "west". Let's call it what it is. the Free World. Is it perfect? no. However, any regular person can step in and change it.
Good! Russian owned  boats are being held.
why NATO army to install missiles around Russia? now all have to prepare for a nuclear war and EU is receiving freedom gas from USA at 10 times price
president putin made new russian dollars
Y cuando los OTAN y USA invadio Iraq Libia Yugoslavia Panama etc nadie los sanciono, hipocritas.
Insurance is a scam.....should be only state own....not private one of the biggest scam after banks.
No problem with with this issue: The printing machine can pump out another hundred billion dollars to cover all costs.
biden is verry dengerous president what will happen the inocent country
Russia is no longer a part of the world community. They are toast for the next ten or more years.
Seizure is another word for government sanctioned theft
bhahhh hahahah. Free plane.... 🤣
This will eventually lead to flight accidents in Russia.
Well guess that’s why our company did not put many assets in Russia, guess you really always need to consider your bed fellows.
Russia is as good as dumpster.
Aircraft sitting on the tarmac unheated for long periods accumulate condensation which produces mold, also becomes a home for insects and mice which chew through wire insulation etc, etc.
It is not as you believe...The media and the U.S. government are lying to everyone... There are LIVE webcams in all the major cities in Ukraine that are on YouTube 24/7 in real-time, and I've been watching 20+ of these webcams everyday for the past THREE WEEKS and nothing like what the fake news or the lies from the major governments is happening in Ukraine... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRLhaucvn6U https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGxqIubxtYc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSMzyzXOIK0
If you rent a car they make you put down a large deposit. Use the Frozen 600 billion Russian foreign assets to pay for the planes and rebuild the Ukraine.
E. U.  THE DONKEYS OF THE USA......  BYE
dont war make love
Lots of planes and no place to go like in the USSR days. Even parked they need maintenance to be worth anything.
The US has killed tens of millions of people since 1945.  It's killing people in Yemen and Syria today.  The world must turn it's back against this evil regime
America can pay for it. Just use the tax payers money. Print more dollars.
when Russia does get going again,  they will need to lease more planes...I am sure the leasing companies  will tack on a few bucks to get repaid...
Till ...............
the west should use Russia’s ForEx Reserves that have already been frozen to pay for the seized planes
The west should have thought about that before this before they put sanctions on Russia. Secondly, does the government own these aircraft companies? If not the aircraft companies should have thought about eliminating business with Russia... There  are lots of companies still doing business wth Russia.
From which youtuber did you steal this from? - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrsFtw3CJy0
Once Boeing and airbus stop servicing them.. they are just sitting metals
Don't be surprised when you have a Claim? Your Insurance not pay..........? Will be a new way that no one will like it....? With the Fires 🔥  October 08/2017 Many Fires 🔥 The Victim's did not get paid,  And will definitely hard to collect from Insurance companies,
It was clear from the start that seizing these plains was a death sentence for Russian airlines and their investors, even if the sanctions are lifted. Any time that an airliner spends "off the books" (not properly maintained and documented) crushes its value and makes it hard to insure.  The damage Putin has done to Russia's monied class, including those beyond sanctioned oligarchs, will be lifechanging for them. Working class Russians have a legacy of toughing out hard times. The wealthy definitely do not.
How can we trust what our country is telling us anyway? How can we trust what we hear on the news? Bottom line we can't. Why should we waste our time listening to Russia and to the US? They both lie. We don't really know what's going on. Putin could be laughing at the sanctions and we think he might be hurting and they're not doing any good. Trump said Ukraine was one of the worst drug infested countries there is. Is that true? Is there a really a reason why Russia is invading Ukraine is it for the good of Ukraine is it all a lie? Also we here that when we impose sanctions on Russia that we are losing more and more money and it is hurting us. What is the truth?
Putin doesn't care about sanctions bottom line he will end up using chemical warfare in nuclear weapons to accomplish what he wants
Godbless putin Godbless rusia Godbless palestine 🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨
The term you were searching for (Oligarchy News) WSJ, is Sanctions. Russia out retaliatory sanctions on the Western allies, using the planes as leverage. He's punishing the Western Oligarchy hoping that his business relationships will force people like Wilbur Ross and the Koch brothers to get their politicians under control and get back to the plan they set in motion when Putin bought the Whitehouse for the Trump Organization.

There is no war crimes as per Fascist Putin because it is only a conflict.  There is no "Declaration of War' by Ukraine or Russia.
*SURPRISE!* Russian pranksters (Vovan and Lexus) made a video call to Home Secretary of the UK Priti Patel --- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ3LEFYJtdI&t=1s and British Defense Minister Ben Wallace --- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzSlNjkQkDA&t=4s on behalf of the Prime Minister of Ukraine!  * The British Ministry of Defense has already stated that this interview threatens the national security of the country and ask to delete it as soon as possible Who is next?... ;)
And millions made homeless and thousands killed. Thanks for the war into perspective.
With the west seizure of Russian assets this was always going to happen. Although that imbecile Biden doesn’t appear to have seen this coming😂😂
Like the Afgan evacuation, Joe has screwed up again!!
The insurance market can't face 15 billion in claims what is that for!
What contorted narrative.  A person that works in financial services.  The west has and will take a bath on this one.  Here is the ugly truth.  Most of the “Domestic” (90%) is by rail.  It will now be expanded to 98%, with those necessary domestic flights including international flights to former CIS counties such as; Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, etc.  this includes other countries like Croatia and Turkey etc. The Caribbean will be crush by this stupidity.     As for the leasing companies, they now have another crisis in their hands with the COVID crisis and the MAX 10 nightmare. Incurring more losses.  The insurance companies have also taken losses on those fiascos that incurred lost of life as well.    The western airlines in PUTIN’s list will now have to fly around Russian Airspace and spend up to three to four hours getting around Russian Airspace, spend more fuel where most buy from you know whom, Russia!  Russia is now selling the west fuel at more than 100% from that of 18 months ago.  Seems like another loss for the west here too.  How about all those plastic parts you speak of, where do they get the oil base raw materials for these parts, yeap, Russia again.  There is no clear winner here nor as rosy as you make it out for the west.  Folks have lost their jobs in the west as well.  Including not only North America but others that support these sanctions.  Moscow has three huge airports and Saint Pete has two.  What happens to all those Airports in the west that is now not getting Russian flight, what happens to those folks?  Some are moved around, but the majority are made redundant!  I pray, for the end of this stupid war and loss of life as soon as possible.
Putin could seize all of these Western planes in his country and load them down with explosives and crash them into buildings in the Ukraine? All he needs to  do is hire some Muslims pilots to fly them?
Pak putin gak perlu lama2 dialog dengan amerika cs, tembakan aja rudal sarmat dan avanggard ke kota2 besar amerika biar dunia aman dari rongrongan amerika, bravo rusia. Hhuurrrraaaaa
The one glaring error in this video, the one thing we know for sure, Insurers will not pay. When do insurers ever pay?
Антифашисты с вами до победы!  Привет из Сербии!
Girl on the right at 4:00 has t"his guy's gonna get us all killed" face.
Viewers Beware. This is the Wall Street Journal  !!!!!  Where else will you see potato head talk big and minimize Russian power.  Enough of gaslighting to mislead the unsuspecting.
Yesterday, March/24 the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada (Parliament) approved an amendment to the Constitution proposed by President Zelensky that now allows for ANY place in the country to be the SEAT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF UKRAINE. You read that right, that means President Zelensky is now free to flee the capital Kyiv and establish the SEAT OF GOVERNMENT OF UKRAINE anywhere he is, without infringing the law, that means he KNOWS he will have to get out of Kyiv ASAP, if he has not done it yet. So, in spite of all the propaganda and the misinformation this is a de facto admission that things are going downhill in the war and the capital will fall soon.
That story doesn't look like an economic surge ... Our story big money on time would smiles 🥰🤣
I need help to build the port I promised in Sabah .. a combination of USA, Russia and Malaysia
what is your bisnes?
This is a lesson to Western companies, never invest in Russia ever again.
Return all Russian Foreign Assets first...ALL... in kind or monetary equivalent ;  before Russian will release Western Assets and providing/selling oil and gas...  If only the West listens and not crosses the Russian Redlines, all these are not neccesary.
Buy them back from Russia frozen reserved funds it's 700+ billions dollars what the big deal about that the west have the upper hand
Gee, who would have thought that Russia would retaliate against attacks? It's like everyone else thought "ho,ho,ho we can seize Russian assets and they will just take it." When Russia seizes their assets, they start whining about how unfair it is. It seems that the Western "leaders" are schoolyard bullies who don't think that they are vulnerable.
Do you think Russian are stupid in making spare parts? In 3rd world countries, Japanese spare parts can be made in Taiwan and or China. similar to airplanes parts, they can make it in China. Or Russia made themself better and copy the airplane tech to boost theirs. God create the world in 6 days. On the 7th day, God rests. But on the 8th day, China makes the rest for any human needs purpose.
Nothing to stop western countries introducing a law that allows Russian foreign reserves to be used to refund the leasing companies for their losses and also to pay for the rebuilding of Ukraine.
All this means, no country should trust US and its allies. USA is like a parasite.
Russia can still fly to Asia.
The West did not think it through properly before slapping mass sanctions, following USA blindly, but repurcussions for EU are different. Russia will survive, there are always companies willing to break sanctions.
In Public view Russia and west are RIVALS.. but there is billions of dollars of business.. where is RIVALITY.. only on MEDIA>.
Something for something (aka, quid pro quod). The only shame is that we still dare to call ourselves Americans and our own despots deprive us of our liberty by denying us secure-access to invest in Russia, to import as we see fit, etc.
So for these companies, Ukrainian lives are not worth saving? Save the planes, let Ukrainians die?
♥️🇺🇦♥️
Wait until you run out of fuel..
Dw they just “sanctioned” them
Russians are the same people whom whem chernobyl blown said not good not terible, do you think that they are afraid of sanctions, not good not terible my comrades
If russia wants to live in the 19th century, fine.
The problem goes beyond insurance. After the war, these aircraft can no longer fly internationally, because no country will accept an aircraft that is not re-certified on its territory. Manipulation of the maintenance book, use of parts from other devices...
If Russia is so technologically advanced, why do they rely on western technology for their airliners?  Why can’t the Russians build their own airliners that can operate around the world like Boeing and Airbus?  They did try with the Sukhoi Superjet 100.  And it failed.  As an engineer in the aviation industry and as a person who has sat across the negotiating table from Sukhoi engineers, it opened my eyes to several issues they have.  While they are academically smart, they lacked the practical knowledge to convert their smarts to production levels.  They are more scientists than engineers.  It made me wonder if their military reputation was really what it was purported to be in our western press.
Was it not the west that sanctioned Russia this was surly going to happen Russia was going to fight back  also lots of western companies leaving massive investment and infrastructure behind because of the sanctions  so Russia will win again
Another load of codswallop, RUSSIA and China will work together,
URAA... From Malaysia 🇲🇾 Support RUSIA.. URAA
Lol, the Western propagandists don't tell you THIS, they claim Russia is losing in every way and the West is suffering nothing. Lies and more lies.
Russian atomic forces are mad and they adjusting nucks on thses planes
Sweet.,..now that's going to hurt . Today with no airlines it will set them back 100yrs. The thing is Russia is known for taking down aircraft (terrorism) . It's going to be like walking on eggshells for the rest of the world untill Putin's out of the picture for good. I just pray Putin doesn't use their submarines to shoot another plane out of the sky. Yes I said (another) because it wouldn't be the first time Putin shot down a commercial airline.
To see  the effects of  economic  sanctions  on Russia.  We have to  see,  north Korea. An isolated  country. Putin  is on his way to become a new  dprk.  His generation  will  held   power  in Russia.
Time for the West to buy Oil and Gas in Rubles
Hello, I put together a POWERFUL video to support those in Ukraine, calling on Archangel Michael to return the violence against the innocent back to it's source.   Please, let's send protection energy to those who need it the most.        @
Most of foreign companies are kicked out of Russia forever. Russia is just imitating the west by stealing others property. The west  has been doing the same for hundreds of years.
meow
Take it from the Russian money being frozen.
Sanction is bad
what about the billions you have frozen and stolen of russia's money.. report on that too. It amounts to much more than the cost of these planes.
You work with a dictator run country w no rule of law then you need to keep the despot happy.  Don't blame sanctions for your stupid biz decisions
https://youtube.com/channel/UCSQSxUJb4zH1SEpzNerSLLg
If they fail to return the planes, give these companies the evaluated price of these planes from the frozen Russian foreign exchange reserve. It is simple
US NATO funding and support neo-nazis, wsj western media support neo-nazi... Nazism is now good Western policy?
Industry to return to Russia you day as you basically froze all their money
Refund the leasing companies from Russia’s frozen assets. Mission accomplished. Once those non-maintained planes will come back you're forced to scrap them, at extra cost. So leave them to the Russians to create&host a Zombie airline soon.
So it's fine for the West to seize Russian assets but it's not fine for Russia to do the same. The hypocrisy of the West is unreal.
Every action has a reaction 😂😂
God bless Russia 🇷🇺✊✊✊✊
I don't know if Russia has leased any 747s, but the asking price for just one such aircraft is in excess of $300 million USD.
West dose not know what is going on next to happen
Switching out civillian flights may not be good - frees up more persons to join army into ukrane
Brandon's brain is brackish.
BRAVO! Encourage the war to make sure that it will continue for the joy of Western weapons fabricators!  So I understand that tomorrow Ukraine will be using the last bullet? Good "news", fake news...
The closed captions have many mistakes. You need to do more checks.
Умирая, Брежнев сказал, - "слон большой, и пока не знает что уже умер." (О СССР). Российская империя уже умерла, но пока не знает об этом. Поражения в войнах приводят к распаду империй. Так было в 1917г., в 1992г (в холодной войне). Так происходит и сейчас. Аннексия Крыма начала разрушение империи и процесс нужно закончить Украине, Евросоюзу и США. НИКАКИХ ПОЛУМЕР, ПЕРЕМИРИЯ. ТОЛЬКО ПОЛНАЯ ЯДЕРНАЯ ДЕМИЛИТАРИЗАЦИЯ РОССИИ В ОБМЕН НА ВЫПЛАТУ РЕПАРАЦИЙ УКРАИНЕ И ЧАСТИЧНОЕ СНЯТИЕ САНКЦИЙ. Иначе  всё повторится сначала с ещё большими кровавым размахом.
If you seize Russian assets you can’t expect them to not to seize yours
HOORAY FOR POLAND!!! Thankyou for Helping Ukraine Stand Up to this BULLY!!! Tell your friends, Tell Russia's Enemies, ALL are welcome to help Dispose of this Tyrant.  Come 1, Come ALL. Join the RESISTANCE!!! China is now trying to do the same to Australia by taking over the surrounding Islands that we consider our friends but for now they are doing it through Dodgy Agreements and not Brute Force. They want to put Military Bases on our surrounding islands to gain a Tactical Advantage WHEN they finally try to use force.  Do not allow China bases in your back yard!!!
The United States frequently invades other countries. In Afghanistan, Iraq, and all the countries in the world that are harassed by American hegemony, the deaths of American soldiers are worthless and are just tools of American capitalists! This is the tragedy of American soldiers!
I just talked to a friend who just left Russia and came back to Seattle today. She said that  the local news in Russia is saying that everyone is going to be riding trains in 3 months. They're literally going to go back to the 40s
The work Vladimir Puta
Planes aren't stuck.  Won't work long in Russia.  They leave, they will be seized.
Russia is the best ever...not USA can't be trusted ... Stealing from other countries
mr.biden better go and sleep.... trump plz come back

Maybe wasnt a good idea seizing russian assets,,,
40% of airport workers have been send to unpaid leave
sanctions are double edge sword Russia will recover by getting help from China and other countries
what I understood about this is that it was in their contracts that if they waged war, the contracts would be canceled and they would have to return the planes. and what insurance company will insure flights in planes that haven't been maintained correctly, especially if the parts have been taken from other planes?
Russians put the first satellite into space  Russians sent the first man to space   ARE YOU SAYING TO THE WORLD RUSSIA CANNOT MANUFACTURE ITS ON PLANS AND SPARE PARTS .  Economically and militarily Russia is facing off more than 40 countries in which United States is the dominant opponent to Russia. This demonstrates the  resilience and Russia ‘s power of endurance .  European countries are too small to stand up to Russia
Rubbish use external countries to buy these parts for them India , china Saudi Arabia or UAE countries amongst a whole lot more and then they can resort to build their own parts
Shameful!!! Protestants cheering a lousy Roman catholic against a protestant nation.
and then let them blow when they get to the us
I would reject all planes from. russia they could of planted bombs on them
😔😭
I implore the fund behind the war, the fund that does business from the war. Please change your mind to do business based on the principles of dharma, good governance, to make this world a better home.
If you have music in your heart, war is not what you need. If you are a family lover, war is not what you need. All humanity, all races, all religions, all languages ​​should coexist peacefully, not hurt each other, respect each other.
give the leasing company's the oligarchs yachts...easy
If only someone had talked about imposing crippling worldwide sanctions against the US for invading Iraq. You have very short and selective memory.
Putin is thief
No worries, just sit it out, sooner than you think Putin will be toppled, a friendlier regime will be installed, sanctions will be lifted, and the whole world will breathe a sigh of relief...
STILL WAITING FOR PUTIN TO TEST THE GOOD IDEA HE HAD TO DROP MODIFIED  DRILL COLLARS FROM HIGH ALTITUDE DELIVERY TO BUILDINGS STILL STANDING, THEN CAN RETREAVE WITH HELICOPTER AND USE IT AGAIN AND AGAIN GREAT IDEA NO BOMBS OR ROCKETS OR MISSILES BUT THEN UKRAINE CANT USE THEM EITHER IS THAT NOT DE-ESCALATING THE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. WHEN TERRORIST SEES ONE OF THESE COLLARS COME TO EARTH AND WATCH IT GO THROUGH ALL THE WALLS WILL GIVE THE TERRORIST REASON TO NOT HIDE THERE AND REALIZE THE GUN IN YOUR HAND IS NOTHING IN COMPARISON TO WRECKING A BUILDING. MAKES THE GUN OBSOLETE SO GIVE UP AND PUT IT DOWN OR THE BIG TOOLS GET A TEST RUN.
You have to know the truth about Ukranian Nazis: https://youtu.be/v5WrBAWwf_I

He’s a war criminal and now just a thief
Take the money for those stolen jets from the 300 billion Russia has in western banks.
What's this?
Hunter Bibens name was found in Ukrane  bio laboritors documents. US is going down.
Maybe if America had keep it's promises to Russia not to push NATO right up to the Russian border 25 years ago, this wouldn't be going on.  And build Bio-Labs too.
10B is like a microscopic wedge for US. Just email Sleepy Joe for Email transfer.
Short term? Leasing companies and their insurance lose money.  Long term? No one will invest in Russia anymore. Yabadabadoo
Incredible the cost of the loss of these airplanes, but far more is the cost of lives in Ukraine. It is incredible that Putin is getting away with menacing the world ‘if they interfere’ in this war…sorry…’military exercise’ - as NATO should call it if they do not want to accept this is a war that involves Europe if not the whole world.
Putin's been making weapons for a long time, collecting enormous amounts. Today, I was able to get his identity crazy to show the world that I was a nobody.  Impulsive Pumartin character, bad temper, does not respond quickly and crazy, so power has been in Control of Russia for so long, selfish, greedy, wealthy, all-around people.  Putin wanted the world to see how great I was today.  Putin, in a few days, will definitely become paralyzed, and many Russians broke from the wealth of Putin, so they don't have much. Most Russians work in the morning to have money to eat dinner, they don't have much. There's a little bit of money to live on a day, and the people who support putin, the aristocrats who like putin, they're rich, they're rich, they're happy.  Putin's in the air room, walking on the carpet, eating nice food, and protected.  The Russian soldiers were difficult at this time, with foot disease, leaving their families to fight.  Putin is more comfortable than any soldier. Taking advantage of people, this putin character, he never thinks about the welfare of others, he just puts himself in power. Let yourself destroy other nations. This is its true nature. Putin comes from the devil. Each one agrees with it, falls into the swamp of fire forever.  So the Russians hate Putin, and the people who support putin, they have a lot of hate, they hate putin, but they don't know how to deal with people that have this kind of ideas, how to overcome evil ideas like putin.  The Russians, they don't want Putin, they're tired of Putin's leadership, because he knows that Putin is Russia's greatest criminal and the world at this time.  In the past few year, Russian people who have had the ability to get out of the country, so they went to live in Europe, America, Canada, or even Ukraine, etc.
Biden is just stupid and he will destroy USA but not Russia.
I wonder what would happen if there was an anti-american global alliance and that alliance wanted to move into mexico
Arrest Putin and Xi Jinping for crimes against humanity!
WSJ- Why be spending time writing articles about massive insurance corporations loosing "billions of dollars" and start educating the public about what is going on, on the ground in the Ukraine. The more knowledge people have about the humanitarian atrocity going on, the more chance we all have of find a solution. I am sure the people of the Ukraine and Russia have more pressing matters happening than planes being stuck in Russia.
The government will support the insurance claims or it is taken from the money seized from the criminal state of Russia. The only effect that stealing of these planes has is that no western business invest in Russia or even rent any equipment to them in tens of years.
All those companies that have closed shop and stop doing business in the Russian Federation, should be ban from the country from the next 20 years, and also be fine in the millions for leaving their Russian workers in the cold.     Let the planes rot, or be used to be carnivalized, just like the Iranians have done for years.
Russia please  send those planes to africa
Good  move. Coz Nato Been  stealing things  like yachts even a 100 year old football club
Russia stepped on the nose of America, Europe and NATO in the dirt😂😂😂😂
sanctions have double sword.
Send the Ukrainians whatever they need,. s-300's, Migs, ammo, the works, now !! now !!!
Who would want to do business in a country like Russia ??  Oh wait - there's Donald Trump, because he's a genius ---- just look at his brilliant social media platform... hahahaha
Good Russia 🗣🗣
Excellent. This topic is missed by most but noticed by your journal. Well done.
Ask Western media to stop nodding at everything US government says before it's too late.  Let them not dance to the tune of US.  One strategic mistake can devastated the world.   It's now on the table of egoistic Biden government. They know very well where they have taken the world for the sake of power and wealth. Though won't admit because of locked brain.  If nuclear war happens to take place you'll know, it's US which will remain liable for the catastrophe.  Wherever they've poked nose, they have destroyed the countries and killing millions in the name of peace and humanity.  From dropping of atom bomb at Hiroshima and Nagasaki to Vietnam which is still suffering. Not to speak of Middle East where they ravaged the whole region
Without access to parts and support from boeing or airbus the aircraft will eventually become paperweights.
They are not stuck. They are now Russian planes. Or do the Americans now want their military equipment back they left in Vietnam?
russia is discredited, no business with barbarians, no contacts with agrsoror and bandit
14 billion worth of jets. Putin got them. Good. You want toplace sanctions. Take dat! Hows the natural gas supply going?
At some point the global world must come to terms with the fact Politicians are singly handedly destroying the world one day at a time, piece by piece dollar by dollar country by country all for the same reasons! Control, power and money and if allowed to continue will ---- you finish the rest of the sentence!
Puttin is the new Hitler
Russians can vacation in Siberia 😅 🥶 I wonder what the word for staycation in Russian is? 🤔
Have that thing be answered by. . Putin😡
I would have thought with all the technology in these modern aircraft manufacturers like Boeing could make the planes inoperable remotely - just like Tesla can with their cars & hence make the planes useless to the Russians. Bit like a safeguard mechanism, if you don't pay your lease you can't fly the plane, given the cost of these things. Anyone here know if this is possible?
Assets no longer important when Putin will be pushed to release all his nukies in the earth as called Universal Nuclear War they say!
so basically russia will become hardcore independent
The narration is horrible. Find someone who doesn't sound like a 15 year old valley girl.
Biden polices are very bad thought he was gonna normalize things not record inflation buying oil from enemies and ww3 someone tell him to hold a emergency meeting with Trump please
Thank you !!! They never appreciate anything . The won war world 2 , alone . Shame on Putin . Without  America and other countries help , would not be Russia . And NOW  he maid angry a world with his Hitler”s  plan . Evil
Ok so they have cut Russia out of the world economy. The EU is heavily dependent on Russia. Russia will be trading with China and India and could very well cut all ties to the west.   What's next, we cut off China? If so how many countries will lean their way? No one seems to be thinking how much American companies will lose by this. If China is cut off it will take half or more of the worlds markets with them. Bye Bye globalization, back to Isolationism for the US.
Using well trained bada$$ women soldiers to hold the front line.. Dolla bad #DollaBAD  https://youtu.be/FPr1qjB59oM
Shoutout to Wendover Productions for this inspiration 🔥💪🏾👍🏾
Ukraine is a country, where are so many criminals , mafias, prostitution and those criminals and mafias are coming now to Europe. This the EU media doesn’t say.
Anyway, the Western nations lose, because Western airlines are going to spend a lot more money in fuel because they are taking the long way around, with more stopovers since they are not allowed to fly over Russian territory, and passengers are going to pay more money for their fairs. Meanwhile, the Kremlin is making a lot more money selling oil at a 122 dollars a barrel, and natural gas 300% more expensive than a months ago
Russia has 600 billion dollars invested  outside and its sanctioned and frozen! They will have to default on the loan of these planes unless they can defer payment or work something out!
The next will be seizing of unfriendly ships...😅
Too bad this didn't happen to all the jets that went to the bogus "climate summit".
"russia is defending their own territories" here fixed it for you.
If US can spend billions to trillion of dollars on useless war, this is small amount. The companies should ask from government to refund their losses.
How is trump going to move to Moscow
GUILTY OF WAR CRIMES ADOLPH PUTIN WANTED DEAD
Funny superficial geopolitical comedy.😂
I hope the corporate world learned a huge LESSON, STOP TRUSTING autocratic countries. Their WORD is MUD, WORTHLESS, THEY DON'T FOLLOW LAW'S AND CHANGE THE RULES TO SUIT THEIR NEEDS! LIKE TRUMP!
Good! Punish those do business with Russian.
Crook givin crook validity
Why didn't the lessees get their planes back first and then just never return them to Russia? Hindsight, I guess.
Putin Locked him up
Not to worry. They can be repossessed from what remains of Russia in the coming months/years.
https://youtu.be/8X7Ng75e5gQ neutral assessment who is to blame
Sanctions are a two edges sword
The maintenance aspect is a big factor. The Russians/Aeroflot doesn't have total capability to keep them airworthy so Putin confiscating them doesn't help him in the least.
The sanction sent a signal to the world that the West can weaponised whatever hih tech products they sold you them. They should join China and Russia to develop their own passenger aircraft in this case and gradually replace those from Airbus and Boeing. The West imperialistic behaviours had once again raise concern to the free world. It's time for businesses to stand up against the politicians who are screwing up their hard work building up their enterprises. They can invest in nations who aren't involved in the sanction to supply the parts or risk losing their market shares not only in China, India, Asean and Africa.

God Bless the Great Mother Russia!! From Brazil
The video is deceptive in that it doesn't give you all the scenarios and options. There is no great catastrophe here.  To one way of thinking not having these planes back might be a blessing...what was going to be done with them if brought back, that may be why there was no panic about taking them out of Russia. This is an economic war and these planes are a dead loss and are going to wind up in a Russian boneyard but all planes wear out anyways. They are USED airplanes. As to weather insurance companies will pay up, that depends, there are certain exceptions in policies that protect insurance companies but there might also be a way to negotiate and SPREAD the loss.
Putin has to disappear. Russian people can topple him. Putin is a maniac out of control. He threatens with nuclear war, but  in that exchange  Russia will cease to exist. I'm for the Russian people, a great people!
Putin is doomed
Russia needs to nationals all this plane, just the same way they sized Russian properties
Insane Biden 😂😂😂
It'll be cash on the barrel head, for years to come (once the Putin mess is cleaned up)
God will set everything right
Everyone assumes they know what is really going on
F the west  go after Africa   and  south of Turkey  you will not need  the western bs
🌻🌻🌻🇺🇲🇺🇦🌻🌻🌻
reprogram the system and lock the system
Why is Russia holding the planes? Well duh, America cut off their reserves, illegally.
Anyone that has been watching flights to and from Russia knows that planes from Bermuda have been flying in there consistently every day which has left many confused as to what is going on.
I kind of like the idea of investors taking a haircut for risking their capital in Russia. It sends a very clear message to other investors that it is far from risk free. The free-market insurance companies will ultimately set the price on taking that risk. I am personally delighted that Russia is pricing itself out of the world community.
THE POLES WANT RUSSIAN SPY TO BE EXPIRED FROM POLAND, IMMEDIATELY! THE POLES ALWAYS DIDN'T LIKE SOVIET. SOVIET HAVE OCCUPIED POLISH MANY YEARS.
Lloyd's says it can cover the claims, they're soon to recieve, from some of those grounded planes, so 💩 tin can shove them.
Anyone invested in Aeroflot should SELL, SELL, SELL, lol, because they are not going to exist when the dust settles.  Doesn't matter if Russia seizes those planes, they won't be able to keep them flying, and we'll start to see them FALL out of the skies, imo ;?)
putins head on a plate
Lol, EU and US companies complaining about losses but isn't it the outcome of their own government sanctions on Russia.
China will be the middle man for Russia connection to western supplies just like they do for North Korea 🤷🏾‍♂️
That’s what happens when to try to give idiots an even break, they backstab everyone.
The leasing companies should have never lent to Russia. It was a huge risk.  They should be stuck with the losses.
russia will be dealt and to be payed. moscow sex girls.

*"US, Europe To Announce "Major Initiative" To Direct Western LNG Shipments To Europe"* It was always about the LNG pipelines to EU and the US-UK-IL Oiligarch profits. More Cheney 20 Year Oil War of IDIQNB Grift Fest. Except US has no LNG surplus to export! *They're stealing LNG from the American People, to export to EU, and American taxpayers just got LOOTED for $13.6B to Ukraine!* Now BIden tells Americans to expect FOOD SHORTAGES *while he's exporting American meat and grains to his CCP pals in China!*
All non-white countries should be worried if Russia, the balance of power in the world, is trumped out of its position. Thanks to that power, NATO has not invaded the remaining countries in europe, bec its goal is to reign supreme over Europe and Russia is the only power that prevents it. Furthermore, if Russia is displaced as the counterweight to NATO power, there no other obstacle to submit the reste of the world... that is why we cant afford NATO to expand.
Just take the 15 billion from frozen russian assets
The best part of this US froze Russia $300 billion dollars of funds. So if Russia doesn't give back the planes. The money is are in westerns banks.
this is a really interesting issue Russia created here. You would be a bold business to reinvest in Russia for the forcible future and even for companies selling good in Russia there a real risk that they may not be paid. Putin problem is that he think Russia can rebuild with out the western good and technology and investment.

In reality , We can't blame russia nor uktaine  the war betwen them.  Why because they are innocent . Further more   the two leader do not know who would win the war.  The only thing we  can do is  be sympatetic to the victim of war . I hope and pray mr putin anf zelinski be settled their differences as soon as possible .
UKRAINE is one of most CORRUPT Countries on Planet Earth. Go figure. Fertile grounds for NWO GLOBALISTS.  Money laundering, Chemical Bio-Labs, Human Trafficking, Nazi Azov Batallion support etc. RUSSIA and Russia alone, can clean up the FILTH
According to Intelligence reports Russia did not invade Ukraine  Russia went to destroy the BIO LABS that were manufacturing VIRUS  as weapons for a lethal purpose on HUMANITY  These labs have been an immediate threat to  RUSSIA as it was at their borders and the Nations around the GLOBE   Till this moment we are still suffering and hanging on to dear life for their distribution of "GAIN OF FUNCTION"  VIRUS   A  virus research on CORONOVIRUS  that is continously KILLING  thousands daily since 2018 as Covid 19  To  the Covid virus is the vaccines manufactured for AMERICA by BY AMERICAN PHARMA COMPANIES  that kills should the Virus be not deadly enough !!! What is happening in UKRAINE  is not a WAR  its DEFENCE  against the worlds DEADLIEST CRIME... weapons of MASS DESTRUCTION  to depopulate the WORLD   According to AMERICAN MEDIA and nterviews with Bill Gates there is an urgency to depopulate the world and they have justification to it   https://youtu.be/eiuplgzbCC4 https://youtu.be/4xzeZ6nzECs
Those planes will be scrap when the Russians finish with them.  I doubt their aviation maintenance programs are much different from their military maintenance.  Corruption is a part of doing business in Russia. No way Boeing is going to lease a plane to Russia with out supplying a trust worthy maintenance crew  to do the up keep. Not sure they would risk losing a 100 million dollar plane because some guy took a case of Vodka to look the other way during an inspection.  Could be wrong but the insurance companies must factor that into the rates.
If Russia survives, it will never be able to buy a Boeing or Airbus again.
The government did this so they should buy the debt then Russia owes the government the money and look here we've already got the money in Russia's account we'll just pay for it out of there
Double standard. Like western countries always do.
why don't you give yourself sanctions for colonization in Iraq and other middle eastern countries that you colonize.  and Israel is still free to occupy the Palestinian state without sanctions.     We Love Russia Uraaaaa.    from Indonesian People
That's why I don't read your blog, because this news is half true.
The leasing companies should sell the planes to governments who could then pay their fuel bills with the planes. Two birds with one stone... Think putin would buy it?
Airlines need to send in the repossession guys who steal back their assets.
"God bless...😇😇😇
On the plus side these sanctions on Russia makes the push for of a one world government a dream.  Preventing Russia from taking Ukraine quickly will hurt the globalist.  Now the globalists will not be able to create their one world government in my lifetime.  If Russia  becomes self sufficient than there will never be a one world government.
I wish NATO would just put Satan to rest .. For good.  He is a real scumbag
Cut your losses.
I just can't understand why Nobody in the leasing industry had the foresight to install backdoor protections to ensure they can recover their investment or else render it useless
RUSSIA lost the SOCIAL MEDIA + LEGACY MEDIA war, Ukraine lost the BATTLEFIELD war, Europe lost the ECONOMICAL war, America lost the POWER war and DOLLAR RESERVE, USA POODLE UNITED KINGDOM (UK) lost the oil war, OCCUPIED GERMANY lost CHEAP OIL & GAS war, OCCUPIED ITALY lost CHEAP OIL & GAS war, OCCUPIED JAPAN lost Kuril Islands archipelago war. Is UNITED  STATES trying to bully CHINA, INDIA and SAUDI ARABIA going to work? Will CHINA join TAIWAN?, You decide who lost the MOST & who lost the LEAST.
Good work Russia 🇷🇺
Putin has hidden accounts that should be seized.
i love how the west is willing to instantly eat billions of dollars in cost just to teach a few hundred dollars a day lesson to somebody else.
Pray for this nation to go back to God not porn and pedophiles put them in jail take this country back before you get on the bad side of God then you’re really gonna see some problems pray for all pray for all yeah there’s a revival comingWe the people of the nation under God prayer does get answered pray for this nation pray for all
Putin he so so evil evil Putin cannot be trusted
Putin stop stop the war war
One nation under God not pedophiles
Solution simple....Russia pull out of Ukraine
Refuse to supply parts and never let them fly into any airports,  surely Russians will realise what's going on
Lucky for Russia they are still friends with China. China may well ask for the east of Russia back though.
God bless ukania family and volunteers! 💙💛🌎
Chump change
Send in special forces and blow the planes up
Another armed robbery by Putin.
Sanctions hurt normal citizens harder than their elite. Just saying...
Bravo 👏 👏 👏 👏  for Putin! Clever
One thing that the planes are going to need but won't be able to get besides parts is the navigation databases and terrain databases and everything that you need to basically fly the airplane safely to any location in the Earth so that's going to be a huge issue for them
What if Vlad simply doesn’t want to give them Jets back?
Would they take yachts and mansions in lieu of the planes? What will Russia do after the war...be a hermit country?
Hahhahahahha. Lol
And what about aircraft that are stuck on ukrainian airports?  Aircrfat of western carriers...
Russia may use those Aircraft as Nuck Bomb Carrier so don't allow them to ask a favor to return them to America.
Perhaps Putin is going to launch a terrorist attack using a passenger plane.
What a Freak! #putin
You know what, let them keep the planes. They'll never get another thing when we cripple their economy with more sanctions. We'll figure out how to cover the cost. No biggie. Slava ukrayini 😎🇺🇦🖕
All prayers for Russia 🇷🇺 …….
Just ask Biden to pay for the seized property. We have the US tax payers to pay for all this
Disabled all of the air planes.
I hope the Insurance companies get compensated by seized Russian Accetts,and Not Hustle the general public with rate increases when we fly.
Fckthe planes and end this BS any means necessary.
You should use a word other than 'Fight' for this heading as it's a bit disrespectful to people stuck in an actual fight right now.
Your paypal link is not working or taking donations for entries.
Gee, close EU airspace. Guess what happens? And these planes are NOTHING compared to the 320B seized by theft. Things are getting REAL, quick. Better hope you have some goods on hand, cause the unipolar worlds at an end.
Wow its Fair  West eat  his own  Medicine, Against russia Hahaha
Someone needs to make a special poison tea for Mr Putin.
These are the same people that sold America and allies to start a 30-year war in Iraq and Afghanistan and look how that turned out. LOL. The waisted money could have paid for rebuilding America and everyone getting a house and car out of the deal.
When putin gets ousted, he can try a teaching career on the subject of Economy.
im sure we're gonna start seeing planes on that tracking website disappear randomly. and im sure youll never hear about it from the Russian dictator
🤣😂😂
I really wonder the short sightedness of the West, specially USA...? Look every things was working for them...before 24 February 2022..  They canceled  systems easily working for them ..trillions of money flowing daily... Thinking they can killed millions of innocent people... But, Russia managed easy way to cut western throat.. Also, showed the worldwide they're untrustworthy ....
Even after Putler is gone and we go back to some sort of normal relations with Russia, they'll still need to pay reparation to Ukraine, and to all these companies they stole from.
russia can use for cheap fight for russia people better left alone
Thick and flap their wings
Putin truly is the political mobster, he's just going to steal a country's assets.
This is great news to the upcoming Chinese airliner.
Putin bankrupt soul,so  why not the whole of Russia.
RUSSIA JUNK

Russia is paying for Putin’s genocide
Ban tank building Airplane building Russia is going back to the Stone Age
Putin will try to use those planes and hold them for leverage......
Good for Russian people
What happened to petrodollar? Now it becomes an economic war.  Who will endure it in two years?   Will EU  give up sanctions to Russia, in one year?  Say, Goodbye to the fraud leader in Washington?,.,..
PutNaZi
💪💪💪💪Thanks Nato
Again:  Simply give Russian civilians weapons. By arming the  ***Russian People they will take out their own Russian leadership TRASH***   Duh               ****Liberty for all, World wide****    Simple.  Fast.  Very effective.  We keep our hands 100% clean
Who cares about a bunch of planes and billions of dollars now.  If WW3 brings out the planes are destroyed and so are the companies who own them.   The best solution for both parties is for Russia to stop its attack on Ukraine and to leave Ukraine  alone.  Then the 🇺🇸 and all then countries will eventually lift sanctions and the planes can be repaired; recovered or put back in use.  Stop the outrageous hyper inflation; the war and the viruses are just an excuse for it.  Pray for peace before this war escalates into something far worst.  When you realize that sanctions placed against another country is an act of war.
America is just as guilty of all these aircrafts or whatever weapons you got yeah I blame this on America
Nice Going Putin! Couldn't you find something else to do than Executing the Innocent! And Unstabilized the world!
Poopy pants Biden & Crack addict hunter's mess, not the American people's
Stuck? They're stolen!
They can do what Iran did. Just keep flying them without maintenance until they start falling out of the sky? Or they could just gtf out of Ukraine and hope someday the world forgives them.
But are my memory wrong?  "After the........ and the following sanctions"?  After? Havent russia and persons theire been on sanctionlists long before ucraine?  Wasnt the politicians, that was pushing the sanctions towards russia and russian companies, aware of that the russians would conter with this type of meassures?  In that case you have to say like Trump, as well as Saunders, "this isn't the way I would have done it".
Russia is the new North Korea.  They will never be accepted on the world stage again in my lifetime.  What a misstep on the part of Putin!   Once war crimes at this level are committed, an occupying country can never get past it.
Dammm
One of many areas where nobody will ever trust Russia again for a VERY long time.
We continue to get a real education about the global economy.
How  am I going to get my plane back  I need help.
USA time will tell is ok what their doind to Russia but many countries lost faith to USA  also doesnt matter what th think  but will make other opportunity for life in future
Everything seems a good unquestioned idea in this modern madness.
Didn’t all these think tanks think of this
Oopppo
In short term, let russia keep them.  They have neither spares and maintenance to fly them or places to fly to.   Russian air travel is fu***d for the foreseeable future. A bill will be due quite soon and russia will have to pay to get back out of the stone age.
THUMBS DOWN: please coach your guests to us a mic for better audio.
America had these economic war planned long ago and America will be the first victim of this economic war. Hyperinflation and economic collapse is coming to the West.
Putin dance...
He'll learn , it's my way or the highway. Punk.
I guess they have spar parts now, why are people surprised, when America became pirates?
Biden pays .. for two idiots (RU & UA) to fight.

If china supplies Russia..then we should warn China that you will be sanctioned as well...its all about Money !!
More sanctioned.crippled Russua
Putin aproveita a vontade do senhor e vai ter com ele...
Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin thought invading Ukraine would show the world how powerful the Russian Military was and its prowess to be feared. I don't believe the world is that impressed.
If it takes 20yrs there should be nothing allowed in or out of Russia and  a loss of all gold presently stored here in the USA!!!

As a current troll agent ... maybe infil ole MAGA binTrump with Kid Killer Kyle and them that Prowdbugabus Bois to start pop up driving ranges on runway east? What a trollific nuisance 😇
Once sanctions are lifted after the war, will any Western businesses be eager to return to Russia?
Russia will never get another lease or be able to buy another foreign built aircraft unless they return or pay for the aircraft impounded. The aircraft they keep will only fly in Russia if they can even repair or maintain them. The resolution will not happen until Putin is removed from power.
Not running but sitting on the ground for a extended period of time requires lots of maintenance and money on top of the cost of plane,,,
Putin wants to return Russia to the Soviet Union Era.   The Russian people should know that it means Isolation, scarcity of essential products and services, famine, and corruption.   Seems like it is all Putin will gain for Russia.
Why is everyone calling him Putin his name is Hitler the murderer
Meanwhile a plane crushed in S. China.
We stand with mr Putin💪💪
no western tourist will ever want to go visit russia in the future , russia is finished , no one will ever trust them again , we were always told never trust the russians , how true !
Biden is a idiot lol they should of never been one sanction .....
The facts about the war in terms of deaths, destruction, captured Russian vehicles remain in dispute, but what is not disputable is the massive and long term damage being done to Putin and Russia by consolidated Western sanctions. After Putin's decision to unilaterally keep leased airplanes, what country would ever lease to him again?
Ukraine needs to retake the Crimea as it really belongs to them.
Define "the west".
All west assets should be zeized also.
Yachts for planes.
Couldn’t have anything to do with seizing Russian yachts? Right???
God luck......they never take care off them
With all of the assets of Russia in the international market being seized I'm sure that these insurance providers could levy a lien on their assets through the court so that they could be reimbursed for the loss of the aircraft and then Russia will have bought them.
Good. Now there's an entire Russian industry... especially the mechanics... that have reason to poke the tiny horse rider in the eye. He's really f..king it up for you, Girls. Vote him out. Permanently. Huh? He's a coin toss to make months end. Why pay a full months rent, on a broken dictator?
Why is usa and west and EU holding the planes of Russia 🇷🇺  Don't teach ur usa imperialism dictatorship on other parts of the world
Makes for a new reality show “Airline Repo”
OK seize the planes,now get the parts when they need servicing,
Ukraine needs to be in the coalitions
I would allow an American companies to take an L on a couple of planes to help the Ukrainians win.
don't stop sanction until Putin is removed from leading Russia. I want him remove from any power!
they can fly between moscow and turkey they better hope they dont need to land anywhere else they will arrest the plane and send the passengers on their way
Russia hold like 300 billion dollars in U.S central banks and in EU. There is money for  reparations s there...
Wall Street Journal should be ashamed of themselves for stealing all of Esysmans content about arrested Russian super yachts and showcasing it as your own!!!!!!
It's one thing to steal something that you can USE , it's another to steal something that NOT ONLY can you NOT use it due to lack to parts/maintenance, you kill off any possible future business opportunities. Stupid beyond belief. It does ZERO good to Russia except Putty's ego.
they dont need them unless your going to Kamchatka from moscow
It’s time putin needs to surrender
sell all assests of all those olgargs and pay it with that
Which asks the question, how long did it take to rebuild Russia after the fall of the old Soviet Union , all for it to crumble in a matter of months ! serious , whats wrong with the people , maybe they will wake up when they are all stood in their under wear ??
Aren t Russian central bank money frozen abroad ? Just use that money and the yachtes to finance the losses.
i hope brainwashed russian people wake up and save themselves ....
Good thing, Russians know who to build thier own aircrafts. Now they are going to work on their innovative talent and still prevail , and I love it 😀 😍
this is why we need a world government that has a world policing agency. if the world had a government putin could be arrested.

Don't ever trade anymore with Russia, that's the overall essential conclusion to be drawn here! We should never have started with it in the first place. Our own western politicians and greedy big business leaders are responsible for putting us into this mess! No more investments, no more projects, no more buying, let those Russians crawl back economically to the Middle Ages, where they're still mentally stuck anyway!
Russia brought all this on with it's attack o

They could sell all the assets of all the Oligarch all over the world boats,jets,homes to offset the value of planes
"Sanctions" are a form of war. WWIII has already begun.
Really is anyone yelling for peace, not once has Biden used the word peace
Didnt think about that Did you Biden. when you babbled out your list of Sanctions. The small country of Rhodesia lived and strengthened under USA and British sanctions for 14 years. You think for one minute Putin didnt expect this. Go back into Hibernation Biden and take your two idiots Pelosi and Harris with you. You are an Embarresment to you country and the world.
This is war! Forget about rules.
Time to blow the dust off of those idle Tu-154's and IL-86's. They're going to need them again.
The US is 100% responsible for this war. They were also responsible for the sanctions against Russia and therefore this issue
What do you think the USA is doing?
So this is Obvious. Russia will have to build their own , second rate , Aeroplanes ......Again
Guys, Russians where isolated for few years in Leningrad by the Germans (Third Reich) and they survived. This nation is thoughest as many of you don't know. Some sanctions can't scare them away. It probably this sanctions will bite the europeans when russia close its wheat, oil and gas market to eauropeans. Then the riots will start out, because prices will sky rocket and supply chain will be desrupted. Challanging times will be ahead.
fair   west seize russian super yatch  russian seize these plane.
Good job American 🇺🇸
Agh yes more profit for BOEING 😵‍💫
So Russia just stole 10billion in aircraft owned by leasing agencies.  What Russia isn't thinking about is that when this is over as it will be eventually, NO ONE will do business with them.
Can Airbus Boeing or airlines disable the planes with cloud software updates ?   Like overwritten the FMS navigation modules somehow?
ANY company that would lease jets to Russia, KNEW or SHOULD HAVE KNOWN, the very high risk of confrontation and the subsequent jeopardy to ANY leased assets or ANY financial transaction, contract or loan would result.  NO government "bailout" for companies supporting the enemy: this enemy or ANY enemy likely to be.
DEAR LORD YOU LOVE UKRAINIANS. GIVE THEM THE STRENGTH AND THE VICTORY, THANKS MIGHTY LORD.

If they have another country join the invasion the gloves are  off   he gloves are off
They can get their engines to design & build their engines. China isn't a dependable partner. The Red Dragon is really a Green 🦎
Some hero should bomb all of these stolen planes to collapse Russia’s domestic travel industry for the sake of all destroyed Ukrainian lives and infrastructures.
The WSJ talks about insurance, without giving a clue as to whether the Lease companies have insurance for this kind of loss, or not. They seem to know nothing. If the Lease companies are insured, they will certainly claim. I shouldn't think these aircraft are covered by ordinary 'Loss of Use' though, and a 'war hull policy' has a 7 day cancellation clause, which I would imagine was issued way back in February. Its a life time ago I was an aviation broker in Lloyds, but surely someone knows what is contained in a lease company insurance policy..........?
The problem now is that Putin doesn't have hands to support his planes like mechanics.
sell a few Russian yachts and start with Vlad's!

Take all the seized assets from every Russian you can to pay the leasors
usa might not care if russia attacks europe, but is europe willing to be attacked for the sake of ukraine? to stop the war from happening europe just has to stop supporting ucraine. no support for ucrain=no war.       support for ukraine=war.
uraa
Good video.
Really, ,,,,so what.... almost a trillion dollars worth of Russian assets have been sized by the West outside of Russia.
Vladimir Putin here's a glass of water I  Prepared  for you
News like this is irrelevant to Putin. His plan is to get triggered into a nuclear war, which is his only way to "defeat" the West, i.e., by destroying it even at the risk of destruction of Russia. He may survive the gamble, maybe not. Either way it is his plan, his off-ramp, and his silent swan song. It's his way out....
Thank you for posting this.  I recall back in the  90's some friends were looking into doing business in Russia.  They were small players so they could not be risk adverse with out insurance and could not get insurance to close deals, mostly because of Russian corruption.  It was not uncommon for a train to lose box cars between cities.  (It is still not uncommon for Canadians travelling to Russia to play in the K but their stick supply does not make it off the plane.  Even coming home in the summer to visit family it was understood that anything you wanted to be 100 percent sure made it back to Canada had to be carry on.)   There were other business issues since at the time if you dealt with Russia you could not do business in the USA and some had contracts with companies that had USA parent companies.    But the interesting long term effect will be if insurers are not willing to finance deals, buying FOB Russia becomes way too risky.  This only serves to make China stronger since if Russia has a smaller market for its raw materials then China has an unfair advantage in the Global economy by saying we will take your raw materials at 50 cents on the dollar and a war torn Russia will have no choice and the USA has to impose tariffs on China and then etc..  I do not envy the people trying to walk the Russia-Ukraine tightrope.
Whats good for the goose is good for the gander!!!
I don’t know why anyone is surprised by this. Putin is running a kleptocracy. This is just....what they do. They can whine about wanting their planes back all they want. Putin will just say:   “What you mean vant plane back? Is my plane now....”  Better to just write them off, and maybe collect some insurance money. 🤷‍♂️
@Wall Street Journal Kindly forgive me but I do not know why I was forced to work for you. I hope you will stop using slaves to write copy in the future. I wish you good luck trying to hire  people that can type stories without violently extorting or hiring 3rd parties to deceive or attack a writer for free or cut price content.
Russia is at war. Remember 9/11. The airline markings and scqelch box would be hard to identify before breaching air space.
Biden y Putin , los mayores vendedores de armas en el mundo,
Russia is digging it's Civil Aviation Grave... If Russia nationalizes (steals) these aircraft, it's finished in the airline industry... the term "in good faith" will never apply again between Russia and any sector of civilian aviation... Russia's word just turned into garbage with every manufacturer, supplier and support company/group... Those sanctioned "Billions" wil be tied up for years in litigation... and believe you me, western courts will not be lenient, russians will get hammered and rightfully so...
Keep Russia far away from youll , there is saying ...be far away from evils
Russia can keep them we will get new ones u ain’t ever getting anymore
Hurraaaaaa! Hurraaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Hurraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!, RUSSIA 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇪🇸

Well no airline company will ever do business with Russia again.
The only option is for the Russian government to invest in Tupolev to start developing their own passenger jets again. Then the dependency will be over for Russia. There are also no problems with spare parts. Russia may be self-sufficient from the West, but it's just barely staying afloat. Russia is a resource-rich country and has everything it needs to be self-sufficient.
On the economic front, this is just another debt Russia owes. In case anyone missed it, yes, the free world can enforce such things.
Economic warfare is better than boots on the ground outside of NATO. It's a second front, and it has an effect on the Ukraine front, where Russian boots are loosing their footing.
The western free Nations need to DE COUPLE FROM RUSSIA,,,,,,,,,, as long as Mr Putin is around,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,then when they change there Constitution to 2 term limits as it was originally until Putin changed it, , we can engage with them again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now that Russian move really was so predictable. You take "our" yachts; we'll keep your planes. Plenty of spareparts there. What will the West do now: seize the villa's of Russians on the Côte d'Azur ? Or the biggest Orthodox church outside Russia, in Nice ? (owner: The Russian state).
Moving forward 20 or 30 years, these big companies will still be reluctant to deal with Russia? It’s called a special military operation, shooting yourself in the foot ! Ultimately Russia will have to pay for all financial losses before sanctions are lifted! The future is very bleak for Russian civilians, due to the miss judgment of Putin and his war, which clearly he can’t win
What did anyone think the Russian's would do! We could also pass laws. The monies of the Russian oligarchs could be used as compensation.  All the Russian owned Super Yacht could be sold. Sell of all the interests in Western Companies.
Long term Russia will make their own!
This is attack on nato country’s 15 billion worth. NATO you’ve been attacked.
Are these your planes? They're mine now
People steal Russian boats and Russians steal people jets. It's a win-win, right?
Russians should help cripple Putin to stop the war and the sanctions.
I don't understand, as far as I know all western airlines have to pay in full when buying an airplane, why of all countries can Russia lease planes? Why not pay for these planes from the russian frozen money!
Buy TSLA now.
The West needs to start looking for legal means to claim against Russian financial or other assets located in the West for both situations like this where the state has appropriated assets but also with a view to post-war reparations and rebuilding.
It is a sanction of attrition and the world is bleeding because of it. And it is a mother of all sanctions. And is this justifiable? And if yes, why?
What wrong with horse and buggy ?  They did that for centuries ..Old fashion donkeys and Russia is beck in Jesus times Putin clams he is Christian?  I wish him meeting  with Jesus at once !
define west? gettig tired of europe refered to as the west? U.S. is west europe is north. most of these planes are from ireland the far north. land of the Norsemen
China is next
During World War II, and mainly in 1943 in Volhynia, the Ukrainians committed genocide of the Polish civilian population. About 150,000 people died. Volhynia and the neighboring voivodeships where ethnic cleansing was carried out before the war belonged to Poland. Today it is part of Ukraine. The state of Ukraine was established in 1991 after the collapse of the USSR. It never existed before. Ukrainians who served Hitler at the beginning of World War II. But they planned to create their own single-national state. They began to murder other nations living in these lands, mainly Poles, who were by far the most numerous. UPA members and Ukrainian peasants murdered in an extremely brutal manner. They killed with axes, pitchforks, cut with saws, hammered babies onto wooden fences, removed women's breasts, cut open their bellies and took out unborn babies, burned alive, gouged out eyes, torn skin from their bodies, and cut off limbs. Poland remembers. 🇵🇱
More evidence that Putin does not plan on returning to the international community.
But who is going to sell or lease to Aeroflot when this is over?  No one!!!!!!  As far as the owners of these planes are concerned, they have been "stolen".  If Russia cannot follow the maintenance schedules, and if there are ownership disputes with the jets, no one will insure them for flight.  And without valid flight insurance, the vast majority of countries will NOT allow them to land at their airports, because they represent an uninsured risk in the event of any kind of accident.   So what this means is that post-Ukraine, Aeroflot will become a domestic/regional airline, and passengers will essentially be flying at their own risk on planes that are likely borderline in terms of safety.  Another short-sighted decision by Putin that is going to push his country back decades versus the rest of the world.  Aeroflot is going to ultimately be left with hundreds of planes they can't use, and that people may be too scared to fly on.
LIARS FOOLING THE WORLD
Excellent. Let's keep putting pressure on Russia however we can. It's not about what it costs Western companies, it's about doing what's right. Money is just money. Children, women and men are DYING because of Putler and we must put as much pressure as we can on as much of Russia as we can. When they've had enough of this, they can topple their corrupt government and leave Ukraine. ALL of it. And then we can discuss reparations and the eventual lifting of sanctions. And if they so steal those aircraft in the meantime, let's just not allow any more planes or parts into Russia until those airlines have paid everything back to whoever they owe it to.  SLAVA UKRAINI !!!
Biden…
Russia will probably just sell the planes used and for parts to China
Smart move Mr Putin.
The Human race is pathetic.
Must suck to have those leasing fees adding up.
Russia = the new North Korea
When the world is done with Russia still be a third world country.
Putin and his genoicide army must be brought to justice ⚖ 🌏 law&order.  Russia must be forced to pay compensation to Ukraine victims and pay compensation for destroying Ukraine completely
Good luck to Russia getting any leasing contracts from Western countries again. Possible available again in say... Twenty years.
what is this person talking about. Russia can fly these planes to another country (like Turkey) and leasing companies can pick them up from there. Also, I believe that there are special flight corridors were created for returning the planes.
Sanctions are always Bumerang!
Ultimately, Russia is going to have a very big rude awakening and they're going to pay a very heavy price for this horrific illegal invasion of a democratic independent sovereign nation! Remember, the late despot dictator Fascist Hitler also illegally invaded independent sovereign nations in Europe and Russia and the Ukraine during WW2 and his spread of lethal brown shirt PRUSSIAN FASCISM! Today, we have very dangerous AMERICAN FASCISM i.e. far right extremism, here since the late 1930s and 40s, "Wrapped in the flag/Nationalism NOT patriotism and carrying the cross"...1935 with their PHONY red, white and blue hypocritical Christian Right Fundamentalism! The antithesis of a True Blue Democracy and their PHONY red, white and blue re-incarnation of the Third Reich! "The past is prologue"...President Joe Biden, in more ways than one and "those who FORGET history, even their DEM/GOP history ever since the Civil War and the 1930s and 40s and WW2/FASCISM are doomed to repeat it"....George Santayana..the truth, if even in shades/echoes per historian Ken Burns!  Unfortunately, "Some people don't want to HEAR the truth, they don't want their illusions destroyed"....Friedrich Nietzsche, another truth and much gets swept under the rug by this corporate controlled mainstream media, just like the late writer/historoian Howard Zinn said we do all the time with American history i.e. the Native American Holocaust , 9/11 etc., much to our detriment, imho, so nothing new there, either, history repeats in more ways than one!  Tell me about it!  smdh
Russia have 300 Billion dollars in western banks, it will cover the planes 30 times their value.
As a former USAF 4 engine jet Crew Chief - I know that Aircraft Hate to sit without external power ... when you re-power them after a long sit - that's when the Avionics fail ...
Smart people talk big, those who has small brain talk on emotions..
Russia will not get spare parts fot the planes and therefore they will be useless in some weeks.

Just hope these sanctions don't end up hurting the world.  And the world don't Go into Depression and the world economy will crash. People will go hungry and the jobs market will slow down.

Can't these planes be disabled remotely?

Biden is a slobbering clown !
US deadly biolabs around the world

No one will insure these planes internationally.
Is about Aerospace industries or Plains this is about super yachts in his mind we stole his Superyachts I think it's now his mind he's got a bigger boat basically. Till it's not fun anymore
If they took them back, they’ll probably be booby-trapped!  Leave them there!
Good! now Pewtin and his oligarghs can return to stone age.
WSJ follows Wendover Productions. Sam literally covered this a few days ago
China will just steal the info and reproduce the parts and sell them to Russia .... watch and see
punishing western traders with Russia is delicious.  Thanks Pootie Put-Put!
I read that they will repair in near country who is out of sanctions! Kazakhstan is not problem !
Source: Wendover Productions
Sell them modified and defective parts with intent to disable and destroy the aircraft they currently possess.
Russia said they can have their planes. Putin only closed the airspace. They can be towed and transfered on land....
Very misleading title. Seems clickbait to me considering this is a video from week ago lol
What happens if Russia closes it's airspace and give repeated missile test warnings over the Arctic to international flights?
Dementia Biden is such an embarrassment, imagine how fabulously Trump would have dealt with Putin??  He'll be back soon enough to save us all.
Lol putin Stolen planes it cannot fix, trust the Russians, good luck anyone helping you In  anyway in the future,  only way Russians are coming back is when the hole government is killed an free elections are held, no one will ever travel to Russia only India an China an syrian maybe a few goons that don't care from normal countries 🤭there economy is going to be 0% in a few years  will putin use the money he has Stolen to save Russians? I don't think so🤭😭😭😭😭🤭🇬🇧🇺🇸
Russia has a huge Rail network.Russians can travel to Kazakhstan for foreign air travel.
Every man falsely accused, divorced, fired, imprisoned, and or serving in the armed forces is the victim of a false narrative by war profiteers and women. Putin is me. No woman is ever held accountable for her false accusations and my government is not held for its crimes against humanity, our war criminals are getting honors while their victims suffer the consequences of our support.  Let the rich, women, and our governments fight their wars.  I LOVE PUTIN! I LOVE RUSSIA! I LOVE #MENSRIGHTS #FATHERSRIGHTS AND #PEACE
Russia can not fly the planes outside Russia or they will be reclaimed by the owners. The West will not fly to Russia or the planes will be confiscated. Which is worse, not being able to fly outside Russia or not being able to fly to Russia?
President Trump in an interview nails it. -  YouTube - Fox Business, Varney & Co., March 21, 2022 - (titled) "Trump says US needs to get off the sidelines in Ukraine's fight for survival."
Guess someone in WSJ watch the wendover video.
Long enough to broke US & EU ego and confidence.
Let's throw out their diplomats in the free world, after that let seize their ambassies.
They won't be able to get parts for the planes so those planes will become very dangerous to fly in a no time.
Ukraine should join non-alliance movement as India, Finland did for maintaining peace. They shouldn't join Nato or E.U nor Russia so that neutrality can be maintain.
wsj has some private jets there?
Wendover Productions "broke" this story first!!
Part of dangers of doing business with autocratic countries…
Oh don't worry, you'll be fu**ed by Putin sooner or later
This is what we get with a president who has been compromised from his sons big money grab from Russia, China, and Ukraine. Also thank big tech and the propaganda press corp for the cover-up for being offended by mean tweets.
...But Biden won't prevent Russian and other terrorists from crossing Mexico US boarder?
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates 🎈
Soon, the US ponzi dollar will die. All countries that us this form debt, will be consumed by their lack of wealth. Russia, China, India, Pakistan and most SE Asian countries, don't trust, believe or agree with the white-West. When the US dollar becomes worthless, it will then have to use the Gold Bullion it stole from the rest of the G-20 countries to purchase anything.
They seized the billionaire private jets but giving Russia hundreds of free jets 🤣🤣🤣🤣 how do these people made their decision
Let him keep these Jets. 10 billion is nothing...
It seems like putin is getting rich from all of this.
I have had the misfortune to fly aeroflot. It is definitely not world class!
Every concession to the blackmailer is his gain, and therefore he demands more and more! The only correct solution is to actively fight the blackmailer and look for allies! Of course, Putin is threatening to launch a nuclear strike, but NATO also has enough resources to make this threat useless! Putin's threats are aimed solely at depriving Ukraine of any support so that he still manages to defeat the Ukrainian army and completely occupy Ukraine. However, after the occupation of Ukraine, Russia plans to seize Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland and so on. This is necessary to fulfill Putin's ultimatum and aims to restore Russian dominance in Europe. If we take into account the reaction of the United States and NATO to Putin's nuclear blackmail, then this development is completely realistic. The only thing that keeps Putin from aggression against the following countries is the war against Ukraine. The blitzkrieg clearly failed and the Ukrainian army inflicts huge losses on the Russians! Please help Ukraine destroy the Russian occupation forces to make it impossible for Russia to seize European countries! If we take into account that the bulk of the total military power of NATO is provided by the United States (the army is mainly located on the territory of the United States) and the fact that the armies of these countries are much weaker even than the Ukrainian ones, then they have no chance of independently repelling the offensive of Russian troops. Don't be under any illusions. Even in Ukraine before the start of this war there were more tanks than in all of Europe, but Russia has several times more of them!
Russia china proof nuclear plant ukrine  sleepy Joe zelennskyy lie court nuclear plant  went news mada   sleep joe lie to court  nuclear plane now get charged for it and Brock sections  help ukrine
If only Russia kept a lot of money, say in a foreign currency, in Western countries that these companies could sue to recover their losses.
