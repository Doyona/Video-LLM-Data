"If this isn't the best rap video I've heard all year, I'M DONE" 12/31/2023
You surround yourself around horrible people and fully deserve the consequences of your action. You're the reason why this generation is dying.
Had this song on repeat all year driving 100+ and along the way I’ve gotten three speeding tickets and one red light ticket but In the end It was worth it so thanks.
🔥🔥🔥
Sorry but attacking fans shows your compensating for something what a lo.ser
All done due to one sucker punch by a short punk
Lawsuit bro
In contrary to all the muppets in these comments i have to say i am pretty disappointed lol. so sad for rap music as a whole. Utter shallow vacuous mainstream unoriginal garbage!!! what the fuck you people on!!??? about as much flow as concrete!! just another chain wearing cliche.

Damn Nardo Wick and his producers either sampled J Dot "No Pen No Pad" or they used the same producer.Might be Jacksonville thang,both of em outta Jacksonville.Idk what it is but I do know they beats sound very similar especially the intro

Bro, Nardo in my top 3 right now with Durk and Baby. He got his own unique flow and beats. That’s how you make it in the rap game for the long run. When you got 30 niggas sounding the same and spittin bs, it gets old. Nardo on top and he finna stay that way for a grip 💯
Bro looked like he jumped out assassin's creed on they ass lol
Gotta mean flow 🔥🔥
Bass knock in the whip. I play this and shut the parking lot down.
If this song isn't played while Elvis is on rehearsal I ain't watching.

CRAZY
Dude starting to sound cornballish. Guns guns kill kill gang gang...if anyone was "with the shit" they will get killed or caught soon enough. So basically dudes getting fucking lame. We get it bro u have a group of equally "cool" dudes who do "gangsta" shit aka be a fucking nuisance to society and if anyone attempts to let u know ur acting like a douche u immediately go 'gangsta" and shoot or kill or jump with your bitch boys. Dudes basically just repeating a tried and true process with his music...act like a real cool super unique gang killer blah blah blah and u cornballs will worship him for it. Do u wanna be cool gang killers and by killers I mean not killing because like I said ur going to get caught or killed also or do u like his repetitive bullshit talking over and over about his fake ass life. Moral of the story is there is basically one word for these tools...corny. Grow up, invest the money u made. Stop living a stupid ass fake life so that some random internet strangers make you feel validated. I'm gonna close it out with I fuck with nards music...keep in mind people used to refer to their balls as nards... but yeah nard face is doing his thing it would just be nice to actually hear something other than the fake ass basic ass repetitive ass queef smelling ass douche ass bullshit. Have a great day nard sucker

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nardo how about you be the one to turn the table on the controllers and sing to save lives and give your neighborhood a chance to keep their fathers around rather than being killed by another father who was also fatherless because of the very thing you sing about.  Is it really worth it?  Turn the blood money into giving these kids a fighting chance with a father.  You know, before the assshats deployed  nodadnobizbullshit, the black community had a much higher rate of staying together, and had a much higher success rate and percentage of startup small business?  (Lets do the end of the new Apashe song.  If you dont know him, it will change you.  He is epic.  Get feat. on one of his tracks and you will own the EU  No such thing as necessary evil. You will know when.

Bust down Rollie, avalanche Yeah, my old bitch average This my first time rappin', and I might go retarded, shit Bentley coupe, I'm dashin' it Stand on my money, I'm tall as shit Told 'em, "Don't you doubt the kid" Told 'em, "Don't you doubt the kid" I ran up thirty on thirty on thirty When I'm in the streets, I stay too sturdy Hellcat, go fast Lamb' truck on the gas I'm only eighteen with big dreams Before eighteen, I seen things Feelin' like a big champ with six rings Or a bumblebee with six stings
Never heard anyone call a watch a bustdown rollie.......but kai

So I use to mine the mountain's of Canada back in the late 1931 for deep mineral deposits and coal, deep up in the mine shaft. I've worked the mines for 68 years of my lifetime. I've been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, stage 3 lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, stomach colan cancer and stage 1 & stage 3 C.O.P.D cancer. I received this notification on my iphone 13+ and immediately clicked. This video has inspired  me to live healthier &  make healthier dietary practices not to mention I'm a fat ass obese & weigh 576lbs. Thank you Nardo Wick ! For this inspirational video & these motivational words spoken of true elegance like a wise & outspoken scholar ahead of his time.

(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."

Nardo Wick, essa música mudou minha vida. Meu ponto de vista completo sobre tudo que existe neste mundo, aliás, até no universo inteiro. Nunca mais serei capaz de olhar para algo que conheço da mesma maneira. Esta música representa emoções que a maioria dos humanos nunca poderia entender. Mas eu posso. Graças a essa música eu despertei para muitas coisas que antes eu pensava serem inimagináveis. Obrigado por esta música primorosa.

Jesus is coming soon!  Please repent of your sin and turn to him.  Jesus died on the cross, was buried, and rose again the third day, in fulfillment of the scriptures.  He loves you and wishes that none should perish.  He died so that we may have life, eternal life in heaven.  Read Romans 10:9-13 for starters.  Believe in your heart who Jesus is and what he did for you.  Are you paying attention to what is happening in the world??  We are at the end, Jesus is coming.
