Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,   (2 Timothy 1:9) - Repent. The LORD Jesus is coming soon.

First beat was cold. 🥶
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Drop really caught me off guard
❄️🔥
Good freestyle but there’s no wordplay or punchlines . Why do a daily duppy ?
DAMN SOO MANY REFERENCES FAM 🤝🤝❤️❤️❤️💯💯💯
Why do roadmen have daddy issues? I seen it with all my friends that chose road life. One thing they have in common was a missing father figure so this child grows up looking for a older male role model which ultimately they find on the roads in the form of drug dealers and rappers etc… what you have a few years later is a grown man that has daddy issues. These daddy issues can include the fact that the grown man has this “Grind” mindset on the road. But all that “grind” mindset is energy coming from anger due to his own father not being there and able to provide so now this road man is on the “grind”. Grown men do not “beef” but roadmen beef.. why ? Because they are children in an adults body 😞
Ain’t bought mum a house but has a buss down and multiple Cubans……
Ktrap - Busy… better drop still 🤷‍♂️
Whoever produced the second beat deserves recognition
