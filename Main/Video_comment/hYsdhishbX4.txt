Its look amazing
Menschen wissen vor lauter Langeweile nicht mehr was sie tun sollen 🤔😶
Matt stonie looks like an Asian Brad Pitt
Good drinking game idea: take a shot every time stonie said Temu in that ad 😂
Brilliant editing
The question I am dying to know is can Matt Stonie eat a massive amount of gur ka langar from a Sikh temple? Or just Punjabi food?
"pain is temporary, pizza fries are forever" um they didnt seem forever as your were demolishing the tray XD
“Something got to me guys”  I would guess it was the 11,000+ calories of strictly meat, cheese, starch, sodium and carbs…
FAILED🤦‍♂️.
I would of went taco salad pico de gio fries here.
you had 2 walls to hurdle over. a wall of fries, and a wall of cheese. i feel for you brother, that was a hard task to do.
I aint shopping on temu bro😂
That looks yummy 😋
can u just eat it faster? :/
He got really confident early on and when I realized he was using five guys fries I knew it wouldn’t be easy
song?
...i heard something COMPLETELY different from what he said in the beginning- PLEASE TELL ME IM NOT THE ONLY ONE-
Pizza fries actually look good I want some of that
Matt didnt know u got 2 dogs
Bro you Might’ve Been Thinking I Got Share
what a beeeeesh
Bro eats 12000calories with diet coke 😂😂
I think u should stop eating all of these junk at the right time for your health ..and switch onto something productive
Bro eats food only when he uploads
Almost
Eres el mejor hermano ❤😊
big fan of you matt been here for a while now
Exp - Nathsss Gold - IDK Mid - Hadji  Jungle - Irrad Roam - Ch4knu Coach - Ako para talo agad 😂
Bro.. u sure u gonna be okay?
reis türkiyeye gel ankara peçenek dönerde 11.000 kalori döner ye
matt needs to invest in a food warmer or something lol
You should’ve been in man vs food!
Never drink water with warm cheese, preferably drink like warm tea if will keep the cheese warmer in your stomach and not turn back into a brick, by experience from Fondue. This is the most efficient way to keep the cheese from hardening to fast
hey give me some
How is he skinnier than that beard guy lol
I love you infinitely charming Matt Stonie 👑♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟😍😍🥰🥰🥰🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
You know that temu is a scam
Such a weak challenge. You've lost your touch Stonie. Weak AF now......
Sause lol
Time isn’t standing still is it Stonie. 😂 5 years ago you woulda demolished that challenge.
Don’t try to sell us scams
“It’s only that much left” is WILD 😝
Old yar beğendi bile
Dang bro it ain’t going nowhere
Despite the portion sizes these foods look so good.
0:44 cute doggos in background
you know what else is massive?
I love watching these types of videos while fasting, it’s like they’re eating for me you know?
fellar i coulda had the first one
Ur dogs are so cute❤
If the Fries were 5k calories or less, he could've possible finished it in around 35 minutes.
Temu is cheap worthless crap. If it works at all when you get it, it will be broken within a week guaranteed! Why waste your money.
Idk why but i think this guy is speed running cancer
5:53➡️”Excuse you!”.
Ahhh so close!
I whont to see your coot dog ❤
Child’s work at temu
That temu did not age well
You never eat fries that look good!
Ilove  matt stone video i like
Use your hand
How on earth does he stay fit ?? Quite a mystery
Anyone in 2025 ?
Those are the saddest looking fries 😂
try isombe nubugali
dont waste food bro
How food waste works: if u fail u throw it out and try again
What did he do to the 1st set???🙄🙄🙄
loser
Naaah why Temu though?
How did no one come up with this until now
Why not actual pizza sauce? Plain tomato sauce is weird
Those fries looking business by its self😂
Matt's dog must walk away from every mealtime in his owner's house saying "Damn, man. Just one scrap would be nice."
hh
5:07 Eat to eat  Makes sense
626.00 Days 17;23;20 Times (104 Week)
Tbh I woulda gone at it with my hands, coulda never finished it without maybe a friend or two.
LOSER
Caseoh light snack
How do eat 95 percent of challenge tgen quit is wild
I’m getting super high cholesterol levels just watching this 😅😂
that looks so good
That. Was. Impressive.
I hope he didnt waste that first tray.
That tomato sauce looks disgusting same with the cheese.
7:18 Lmao
It would have been easier if he ate with his hands and not the fork
1:42 ngl i alr know it was temu
Matt, you’re one crazy person lots of love bro. I probably need maybe a quarter of that keep going and don’t stop unless you have to better to be safe than sorry right
How do you eat all the stuff you do and not end up the hospital?
Why does this look good?
should get a torch keep it hot and toasty maybe.
10 missed calls from lienfield🤣
All you needed was some ranch and Louisiana hot sauce
Wow. I really hope he didn’t waste the first tray.
Somewhat epicmealtime inspired video.
Great,now im im hungry like i havent ate since u woke up
That's insane i would explode eating all that lol
how do you fit this ungodly amount of food into your stomach
Massive respect for his heart it must be the real champion after this.
you shoul eat three jars of peanut butter, no drinks
What fries are you using?
Pain is temporary -Matt Stonie.
7:52 but I thought pizza fries were forever
i respect matt, but this is the most american thing ever
fun fact: he doesn't even eat until halfway into the video 4:24
This big waste of food ain’t going lie
This guy is absolutely crazy
Nah promoting temu is just as bad as promoting crypto 😂
dude partnered up with temu, for me he went from hero to zero, do your research instead of blindly taken cash to promote whats one of the worst companies in the world.
Ez to eat all of them just need some salt on it
go to work
"Pain is temporary, Pizza fries are forever"                    -Matt Stonie
واو
Lol im a foodie 😅
Wait. Where did the first tray go???? He DIDNT THROW THAT AWAY?!!?
Matt stonie the TEMU sellout.
6:13 Rip.
Matt is the type of guy to drink the entire ocean in five seconds😂
Matt is the type of one to drink the entire ocean in five seconds😂
Bro is so mean to his dog
wow, what'd you do with the last attempt? "Cause if you don't want it, you know, you can just...ship it...to my...house.
hi matt been watching you since OG vids you one of best eaters man
ohh yarrrrragımıda yeee evettttt <zz3zz4z4 <3< 3< <3 <3
Who is watching in 2024
Disappointed in Temu sponsorship. Sry but downvote and unsub
You aint season the sauce stonie🥲
😂😂😂
Don’t sponsor temu, it’s bullshit
Matt Stonie, destroying his arteries, heart, and liver for everyone's entertainment.
love how bro doesnt give 2 shits about clean up later, like the messes he makes are wild, but keep up the fire work
the airpod maxes for 62 cents on temu 😭🙏
Happy National French Fry Day 🍟 from Matt Stonie 🍄
Is it your stomach acid or is it just the size of your stomach or both????
Anybody else notice the time on the oven
Just look after yourself - no need to worry if you didn’t Finnish my side . 🌷
Loved the video matt but there are some things that I have been noticing lately. Firstly you're barely uploading videos anymore. Back then you would upload atleast once a week and now it's barely once every 3-6 month or so. Secondly you're failing a lot of these challenges lately I don't know if its because there's more food than in your usual challenges or you don't have that capacity anymore. I hope you cam improve on these two things. Thirdly and I'm not the first guy that said this in your comment section but the editing and fast forwarding in your videos has become a problem in my opinion. We barely see you eat the food in a regular speed.  No hate I love your videos and I started watching your channel 9 years ago
🏃‍♂💩💩
1:11 fail 1
Good thing Lionfield isn't after you after this vid lol
Rly did u make 2 times cause not like how u pour the chesse omg
After throwing the first tray straight into the garbage bin, time for business 🤑
bro: why am i so fat  bros diet:
Shit look nasty lol
What was wrong with the first tray ? Don’t get it at all what a waste
I know what pipe it’s going to the diary pipe cuz you going to be on the toilet
ale pizda
Árbol 🌲
I think That’s a lot of Calories, Right?
We all have that one friend built like a twig who eats like this
Temu ad is crazy
There is no way I would want to be like you, Matt Stonie. You are just increasing your chances of contracting diseases like diabetes and stroke. Health is better than wealth and Matt Stonie you don’t give a shit because you are blinded by your fame and hubris.
didnt even start eating til halfway thru the video
Its good to know when you absolutely have to quit.
Matt you should do a Mac and cheese one
I'll definitely 😁 prep me one of those! Good video bro!
It's hilarious to see him changing from super energetic to sleeping in just 10-15 minutes of eating.
U should make some content like joel hanson. You would beat so many challenges my man. Thats fun to watch too
Whole bottle of Da Bomb
I am mad hungry rn.
Pizza fries?  This is what I need in my life.
How many calories was the pizza?
how are you still shinny?????
watching this 40 hours into my 48h fast
Cette portion pourrait nourrir une famille africaine pendant 1 semaine. En fait on s'en fout er c'est pour ça que j'adore les États-Unis. Go Matt
Flabbergasted by the fact that you would waste an entire tray of food because you had to make it look pretty enough for your Youtube shot. And we know you didn't share that first one with your lil friends because no one would willingly eat something that looks like a pile of steaming hot shit.
Redo this challenge
Lionfield left the chat
1000 - 1 your only defeat
Is he real
maxtt stonie eat 100 burgers nextttttttttttt please
bro just wasted the fries at the start
Oof I don’t believe he sold out to temu… I wonder how much they were paying him considering they’re an extremely shit marketplace for knock off goods
This is Your 9th Food Poor
Epic meal time
Temu is a child labour shop dont buy of them
Mashed potatoes with gravy and chips the best food ever😋
Erik the electric do this challenge next
You got this much matt stonie don't never give up
Respect for the dog sitting through these videos.
I'm fasting 😭
Something like 10 lbs of French fries seems to be like the universal limit
Use your fucking hands not a motherfucking fork
my mom gets mad at me for holding the fork or spoon the way u do hold it
What happened to the the other tray?
The man eats these but does not gain weight
To be honest rania could do better
me be like: ay save some for me mam
If this keeps up, Matt will have a stomach of diarrhea. Or even worse, he could get stomach constipated before pooping.
This is insane. The food looks big and massive! He's gonna get full by the time his challenge will be over soon.
I keep waiting for him to say "and we want to thank today's sponsor, Pepcid AC.." lol
He forget to eat plat...
Ik that was like 200$ in just fries bc of fives guys 🤦🏽‍♂️😭😭
Temu is a scam guys. don't do it.
if you use spoon you could've been faster
Your dog is like: "I want some of that."
Temu is a scam
Bro stop wasting food instead give to them whos really need
a 30 second unskippable ad 1 minute in.   wow youtube wow

So did they ate their fail attempts? 🤔
Best challenge ever Matt. You push your limits more than any other. You are one tough dude!
Woah Chef master stonie
Me eating my school pizza in the 90’s getting it for $1.25 every Friday.
my drunk ass just prepared this, when im done drinking im bouta slap that oven on
That look absolutely beautiful
Temu is WILDD
why did you make a second one? what was wrong with the first?
It’s surprising you eat a lot calories but still u haven’t gain a single weight 😅😅
we are witnessing the end of the era. less feats, more ads!
My mom uses temu
absolut waste for a single person, reguardless if its healthy or not, it could feed a atleast 8 people that probebly need it more then some person looking for clicks (especially the first batch wich i guess you threw cause it failed)
We saw how the food goes in but how it comes out!?
0:35 jesus that gave me a fucking heart attack. Had to slow it down cause I thought it said something different.
Scratchy tray ahhhhhhhhhhh well done tho it did look lush mind
Increíble Matt 🎉👏🏻
This is sh*t. I like this recipe food called pizza tray fries😋💛🍕🍟
Do you think you can compete with Molly Schuyler?
literally pizza poutine lol
Na that looks lush
Going back to the Bible after watching this. It is my duty to warn you against gluttony. Just worried for you.
The music in his videos never disappoints 🤘
Eructo/Burp/Arroto: 5:52
Respect but not for temu collab its getting investigated by fucking fbi bro
My idol 😅
imagine being the cameraman and experience Matt literally inhaling some food
YOU ATE MY FAVORITE FOOD!
Bro straight tomato sauce??? Uuuuugh 🤮 get some pizza sauce next time lmfaoooo
My only question is did you waste all that food from the beginning cause if then 😤 that isn’t okay but I still love your vids😅
You purge yourself after?
Jak ty tyle pochłaniasz, człowieku?
dog abuser jk
BRO WHAT IS YOUR DETOX ROUTINE AFTER THESE MEALS HOW ARE YOU NOT HUGE ?????????????

he is a menace using the fork to both fries and pizza
Me: eats only cheese and pepperoni  *gives fries to my 3 pit bull 2 german sheppered*
Pain is temporary pride is forever by president John F Kennedy
Be careful of your heart to the doctor because it is not your fault but just be safe!
Imma try to make this
How are his arteries not filled with fucking plaque and fat from all the food he eats
I wonder what he does as soon as the camera cuts off
What happened to all the food in attempt 1?
Watching this while I’m on  strict diet .. crying from the inside 😢
Can you do a video on your visit to your doctor and overall health?
It’s way too cheesy and cold. That’s probably why he didn’t feel like continuing. He would have probably vomited beyond that point.
Temu is a massive scam with crap products so u shouldnt do it
fall
disgusting
It takes Matt Stonie to eat almost a whole tray in 32 minutes and 42 seconds to finish, but i takes my cousin 1 hour and 43 minutes to finish a small bowl of rice
L Sponsor
McQueen is fading
Mozzarella cheese is hard to get down especially when it’s all thick lumped up like that lol it’s good at first then it gets cold and hard.
I would have never thought to put pizza toppings on fries 🍟 two of my favorites 😅 Go Matt Go!!!
Tbh looks like a great food just maybe not that much 😅
3:19 AORUS??? 22.11.23
next eat the whole mcdonalds menu x2 infront of a homeless man
Just when I look and go wow he doesn’t have much left hurry up I realise the amount of food that is left can feed a small army
I dont think people really mind you not finishing it, I think people just like watching you eat in general. You should do more mukbang style videos.
how does he eat so much but stay so skinny
How are you not fat yet?
I hate when food get stuck in my chest and then I have to drink something for it to go down
Matt Stonie been losing his edge.
You could use your right hand to eat quickly.
Matt stomach really act like a blackhole,to see he swallow a large amount of food without difficulties is beyond human logical
It's really amazing how much food goes into your body.
I cant remember the last time food won.
Matt: eats whole tray of pizza fries in 32 minutes Me: can’t even get the fries to go on the fork
The most unbelievable part about this is how could you not give the pup a piece lol
Are fries challange the hardest?
It's just acting.He doesn't eat & act like he's eating.
ew
Thats prob 20k calories honestly with the cheese and pep
Temu…….
Temu is a scammer they steal Information and they steal credit card they literally in trouble with the US government don’t trust them
Respect for take 2
how does this dude not look like nikocado avocado yet
Matt your video’s now feels like nostalgia for me.back in 2016 my parents bought me my first ever 16 inch TAB and I randomly find your channel and started watching your videos all night.Ahh man those days were awesome.Lovely content you gave.♥️♥️🇵🇰
How the hell do you keep yourself in that shape???. I just eat a hamburger and boom
bruh how does ur heart handle this like before exercise
Temu is my kryptonite lol 😂
Sorry  but your math is way off!!! That's way more calories than you think 😮 Anyway it's more and you're the Mega Toad.....oh yeah 😂
Wow! My mouth is actually watering from looking at this🤤
Is this channel a microcosm of America?
I would love to see his belly after this xD
I think he could eat more faster if he eats with hands instead of a fork.
only an American could come up with this, disgusting 😅
Hi Matt here is one of the best pizzas https://youtu.be/ItVpFNdSUZA?feature=shared a fan from France 😊
Where does it all go lmaooo
My man forgot to grab himself a bottle of ranch to go with that. Smh
Yummy
2:56
1:19 that is so relax bro
I have a dream...i hope it comes true....i want to see him sitting and finish his meal peacefully like a normal person.....
All sat cheese 😭😭
The tomatoe sauce that's what happened 1000%
imagine Watching Matt At 12:30am
thats a lot of tomato "sause"
REPORTED
you were so close, only 1.05 trays to go!
nah old Matt stone wouldn't have tapped out there
Idk why but whenever does the hehehehe it just makes me smile
You wasted that first pile is...
You gotta redeem yourself and do it again
Like and comment if you like to watch Matt Stonie suffer.
SCAM Stonnie 👎👎
The amount of cholesterol is killing me
Bro do you actually let your stomach digest all that or you just vomit it out after the challenge and if you don’t how you are so lean throughout this years????
temu is serious bs. google it. they are selling you data.
Dear Matt please show your belly after eating huge pile in next video.
Why take. 2😮
Did you seriously throw away all that food cause you missed?
Benim sevgilim daha güzel hüp diye yerim onu
where did the first batch go???
Why tomato sauce? Shouldn't it be pizza sauce cause tomato sauce has no flavour. Unless...
How do you eat that fast?
Bro is legendary person
Wow, I consider you a winner. Challenge completed ✔️
He would make a great grandkid for all grandma's out there
MAD RESPECT DUDE!!!!! You did AMAZING!!!!!!!
I most definitely would wash all that food down in my belly with diet coke water or Sprite, facts 💯
The GOAT!
Yow, how long does this man sit on the toilet?!
The girl behind the camera discouraged him in all possible ways😂
Why are Americans like this 😢
why do I watch this at 3 am while hungry bro
Anyone who takes a TEMU sponsorship is not a good person. You are literally getting scammed.
Kinda sad an OG sold out for Temu…..
What did you do with the one you did before, there was nothing wrong with it. I dont know why you didnt cut that part out man
I wish I was there with you man eating that
#furiouspete vs
My stomach hurts watching this.
Casual eats the first off camera to come back to make another I wish
Come down

Don’t use temu they steal credit information
Bet I could only do half of that and I'm on the ground laying on my back
How many carbs is that? Even ChatGPT won't tell me
This is my favorite video
Man, how do you it?
Add tomatoes also with pepperoni.
Eat with hygiene gloves. And not with a fork 😊😅
Dude just eat with your hands
Do it without the water
How he dnt get fat at all
Dang bro you can eat.
Gawd that srap at 5:35

Pain is temporary, Pizza Fries are forever. -Matt Stonie 2023
So healthy 😊
Stop! and be realistic 30yr old.
Nick avocado could finish that in 3 min.
Damm Matt your channel turned into an ad fest
Too much food, are you sick yet. Your stomach will explode.!!
i think he is out of practice
Im tryna figure out where batch 1 went
do you find food delicious anymore?
4:00
wow matt doing solo (mean one person) great work
The mental fortitude required for this is absolutely insane.  I've forced myself to eat on many occasions but never like this. With all of the things I've forced myself to do (weightlifting, cardio, ice baths, etc...) I genuinely cannot imagine forcing myself to eat THIS MUCH  You are on another level Matt 🔥
Why didn't you gain weight man , your so gud at this. Plsss say your secret not gaining weight
I can’t imagine the poos you must take
small challenge for him. the other cheesy vhips he did seemed bigger
“Pain is Temporary, Pizza Fries are Forever”    - Aristotle
So um…. What happened to the first tray of chips?
Mejor que le dieran comida a los pobres...
Those fries r absolutely hard to eat asf😭
I like how mad we like 12,000 calories and then drink diet Cokes like it's going to help him lower his caloric intake
Bro, I would not be using the tiny spoon to eat all that I will just be using my hands
I appreciate that you made it a second time lol.
king of toilet bro... rip your butt
What happened to the first batch
This looks good
Have you ever competed against Joey Chestnut?
Mad respect for the cooks that had to make 10 large fries🫡🫡🫡
Man next time split the tray up with different fries
Use marinara sauce it taste better
Huge disslike for That china crap temu shit
I really don’t remember the last time I’ve seen Stonie tap out.
🔥🔥🔥
i think it would be better if you use hand for the fries and spoon for cheese
My guy rlly did an attempt 2 to pour the toppings over the fries correctly 😂 what happened to the attempt 1 food tho
He old
Separate they look great but together those two foods look gross.
i guess the first pizza fries goes to garbage huh, what a waste if it is.
Bro how can he eat all these calories without being fat 😂
Do you smoke weed before you start recording? Is that how you’re able to eat all this food, because weed gives you the munchies
Mmmmmh pizza fries 🍟🍟🍟🍕🍕🍕🍕
The food is good because is more big and deliciuos for the people bot mouch colesterol
matt stonie the realest
This would make og epicmealtime smile
1:19 😂
Wait…😂😂😂 so you wasted all that food because it didn’t look cool 😂😂I wish I had that kind of money
Nah temu held him at gunpoint😢
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  Temu code dont work

You should do like a Giant Dave’s got chicken bowl challenge like this
Damn I'm hungryyyy
what happened to the first bunch of chips and pizza ???
no way you promote temu, a company that sells your personal details.
Props to matt fir being one of the few MLE eaters who has something outside of MLE contest.
Gotta be an expert at purging!!
the fuck you mean take two?? did you thew everything away ?

MATT'S POOPING NUKES IN THE RESTROOM
Don’t worry the fort coke cancels it out
My Matt stonnie has lost his touch 😢
Although stone eats tons of food I respect him, he doesn't waste food
that looks so good
He can eat large portions of food and not waste and become fat like nikacado what a legend
You just throw away the first attempt?  What an @$$hole!
I KNOW HIS ASS HAD TO BE ON FIRE WHEN HE WAS TAKING A DUMP AFTER THIS
he better throw up all of these after cause ain't no way he is digesting all a lot
Did he eat the first one 🤔

This guy puke after every challenge the body can not process all that fat can you imagine the shit throw
You used to be so much fun to watch.
pizza fries are actually one of my favourite dinners to make when there is nothing else that seems good. while five guys fries are absolutely delicious and full of some nice potato flavor, we always make our own and air fry them so they stay crispy for longer amounts of time. we make at least a decent sized baking sheet full of them for the family, and they’re surprisingly a good hit at the house. we eat them probably once a month, and if we’re feeling adventurous, we’ll throw in some sausage to cut down all of the cheese and richness. we use a very lean sausage to counteract the richness, but we also try and keep things light regardless. we don’t put that amount of cheese and tomato sauce on it, sadly. we usually will add it on after the fries are done and then bake it again so it melts faster and gets a pretty nice crunchy and crispy cheesy texture around the edges of the pan where it drips off of the fries. it’s a great treat on its own too. i make myself a plate of them for lunch just in the microwave when i’m hungry but nothing else seems good.   mad respect for tapping out and not forcing yourself to eat all of it. i’ve seen tons of competitive eaters over feed themselves, and they’ve seriously messed up their stomachs. a big appetite already is nuts, but overfeeding an already massive diet can be detrimental. so mad props for tapping out when you couldn’t continue.   i used to be a junior competitive eater for my school before my health hit a rapid decline. i was in the running for a small little challenge that could have given me some decent money that i was going to put towards my university fund (i’m in community college. this all happened my freshman year, first semester, including my decline in health), and when i got sick, it all just crashed and burned. still going through the motions of struggling to maintain my appetite and eat properly, but man that was fun.   so admirable you know when to tap out or keep going. you’re so dope, and i wish i was like you again. i would kill to go back to that time period and enjoy that part of life again. going on ten months of torture and pain, and your videos help me cope with not being able to raise some money for my school, as well as getting some cash in my pocket.
How is this humanly possible lol
He looks healthy but he’ll regret one day his health is already damage
Покушал на неделю
I’m surprised he’s not auditioning for My 600 Pound Life with all of that food he shoves down his throat.
Like the diet coke with the 11k calories worth of pizza fries.
nice try sweet stuff
ive been watching matt stonie for only a day. im underweight for my age (18, <90 lbs.), and just watching videos of matt shoving food in his face is encouraging me to eat more. idk the psychology behind it, but i hope i stay encouraged to keep eating.
What is always confusing is how you can turn this food into feces in your body and how you can flush it down the toilet. I mean, there must be a scientific explanation for that.
I was falling asleep and u choking scared me wtf I like had chills of not being able to help
my question is ,,why you don't get fat?????
Este vídeo es muy peligroso, entiendo que no lo hace aposta. Pero un niño ve este tipo de vídeos y es apología a la comida
What happened to the first one
The cold drink hardened the cheese is what happened
So many things went wrong with this. It all started at hunts sauce and cheddar cheese
Fuck that looks good
pain is temporary, pizza fries are forever -Matt Stonie
I don’t know how you do this mate… your videos make me all hungry and then I’ll have 2 slices of pizza and I’ll be like… I’ve had enough 😂
I am still shocked at how fat he is after eating all of this even if he does work out, he would have to work out almost the entire day every day for about a month which is crazy dedication
Give some respects to the dog
Average “light” 3 am snack
That dog definitely never gets any left overs🤣🤣
What he do with the first one broski?😊
Why do you never be posting a lot of videos because I miss your videos please do them again
🗣So close❕️ That looked difficult‼️
He's a beast
His heart after years of this abuse: ❤️‍🩹
Man is eating 5 days worth of food In one sitting
Not enough pepperonis
Bro had to do it again because he didn’t get a perfect pour 💀
wheres the first one
how
does he barf after all this?
Me watching this because its night and im hungry but i cant make food because my mom and dad would kill me
Hey Matt, how come you don’t participate in the Nathan’s hotdog contests anymore?!! Please reply back!
first bite tastes like heaven, the second one takes you there
Mad respect for Matt's heart to bear all this madness.
Damn son!!!! That was an epic attempt! Your hurting foe show !!! Way to stretch the stomach! I’ll bet you didn’t eat anything for a while that night! 😅
How do you eat so much and stay thin
4:59 What this sound  i love it
Метт красавчик, но не тот что раньше 🙂. Раньше он это съел бы за минуту, точнее проглотил бы.
Bro you videos are Great! I’m only 12 but I have been watching you since the 1000 pepperoni on 1 slice of pizza and I still love watching your videos
1:35 Kevin Rochon Samuels much?  TFFFFFF?!
Kids DO NOT ATTEMPT this its way to much salt! Talk about rising your blood pressure.
Matt should visit India and do food challenge there too that is the video series all are waiting for.
HEY YOU MADE A BRAND NEW TYPE OF LASAGNIA NICE TOO MUCH RIGHT
Bro watching these videos makes me hungry
Great effort ma
The guy would  not have pizza and fries for a long time😅
hangy 🍔
6:28 the dog wanted some lmfao😂
Matt how are you still not fat I need your routine
Esttik is better!
That Temu Ad music gave me Kevin Samuels flashbacks lmfao
Fake
https://youtube.com/@NoNoo62
Isn't Temu a scam....?
Ok
Ok
Hay bro. You feat influencer Indonesian food chanel. TANBOY KUN.  ok. Iam fans from Indonesia
such a huge pile of pizza fries and yet it has slightly more than half the calories of the octuple bypass burger, kinda crazy when you think about it🫣
LOL my roommate thinks that Matt is just some lucky asshole who doesn't get fat from eating
how is your health ?
How the hell this man doesn't get fat
💀💀
what happend to the first take? did u throw the food away just do get a better video?
Man that girl is evil lmao, you sure you don't wanna finish that little corner fuck a heart attack. Like can totally see someone like that telling you to finish yourself off, you sure you don't wanna use that last bullet?
Ali t'as pete
Pov 5 yo me fixing a plate of food thinking it's massive and 8 years later I can eat 4 times that
He has a massive💩’s No sex tonight😂
Matt stonie vs Joel Hansen
Awesome 👍😎👍
Thank you for suffering like this for our enjoyment, i think thats what i wanted to say, im aure rhe food taste's delicious the first 276 bite's but after the 300th i cant imagine your still craving for another bite
I love this channel, matt is awesome ridiculously entertaining! I'm curious to see what his doctor visits are like! When asked about his diet because the man is skinny!!!!!! How I say ....how?! What food does he eat when he's not doing this? Does a regular meal satisfy him? What does his stomach feel like when he's done with the challenge?! What headspace is he in at the end? When does he and his partner do the DO? It it when he's full? Is it her kink? What's his energy like? I wanna be his friend! And help him make the food and time him but like the day I feed him too much of something and things go wrong I'll never forgive myself! People who eat for sport fascinate the shit out of me! I always cheer them on with caution just be careful make sure your breathing chew chew CHEW your food! (Not that he doesn't his jaw muscles look ripped! Lololol)
Mom"You can get some fries" Me:
Keep it on one day you eat like Eric the electric
My liege.
Bro eats quicker then me eating a small bag of corn nuts
700 cals in that pepperoni?
I hope somebody ate the first try
are you wasting food?!?!?!?
Not me watchin dis high asl wit da munchies😭
That looks really good
Matt literally being sponsored by a company being investigated for slave labor lmao
Did You Skip  Nathan's HotDog Eating Competition ? This Time Joey Chestnut Won That !
i challenge you to give this amount of food to each child in africa to see if them don't eat more intense, happyest and fast than you
Video idea eat every item at Taco Bell
I been watching your videos for a long time now and as you know already you are the best of destroying food , I assume you have the strongest guts!!!The intestine and the stomach and the pancreas you have must be made out of iron !!!Omg how are you eating like this so easily.
How have a cute puppy ❤❤
❤❤

My type of meal word to my ✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️
Stay hard.  David Goggins  😂😂😂😂
Why don’t you compete in Nathan’s ??
JUST DRINK WATER!!!
What did you do with the o first attempt
The Mental Fortitude required to munch on when you're full till your neck, you're a legend Megatoad.
I am not mad at him that he ate pizza with weapon
Matt is the king of diabetes😂
I was enjoying your video until I heard your fork scrape against the metal baking sheet 🥴😖
Estos excesos te pasarán factura. Cuidate.
His shit must be containing high calories and nutritions.
welcome back master eater
Temu a scam
Bro did you just waste that first batch of food?!
bro took 32 hours to eat
“Pain is temporary, but Pizza Fries are forever.” -Matt Stonie, 2023
Where's the other cheese staff with beacon?😭 what did you do to it??
Stonie ain't the monster he used to be
I want try this
“Pain is temporary, pizza fries are forever “ - Matt   That was literally the best thing I’ve ever heard anyone say.
recipe?
Every time I watch one of these I'm both sick to my stomach and starving by the end...
As a vegan I love watching Matt's videos while I eat fresh fruits and veggies, it gives me so much motivation.
Love your Content, but Temu is Trash.
Oh no U took the temu sponcer 😒
I m here a year later.. And this guy still alive and eating 🤨
Matt getting old
How r u still alive
hot plate it next time keep it warm bro.
second take 10/10
If joey chestnut and takeru Kobayashi had a kid this is who you get
the things black hole devouring are stored inside matts stomach
😊o
Did he waste that?
Who else gets hungry watching Matt's videos bc of all the delicious food he makes and buys
The immortal feeling of matt stonie's will to never throw up makes me wanna throw up.. but goddang, you devoured that thing
What a waste of food for doing it twice SMH
No offense to Matt stonie but I'm surprised he isn't fat yet like nikocado avocado😮😮😮
Who ate the first one and why not just use that one? XD
You do know Stonie purges after most of these meals 🤮
Bro, you need to stop doing these challenges! Your body is trying to tell you something but you aren't listening.......
What happened with the first bach!!
Boy, oh boy! Your videos have gotten so much worse over the last months/years! I miss the old Stonie!
Tomato sauce is not pizza sauce so it probably must taste really bland 🤢
Still waiting for two things to happen .  Matt eating himself to death  And ? His mother storming in asking  You doctor yet?
Ok tho if you dating or married to Matt your like “ok I made some food” wait where did it go
I think this is more food then I’ve ever ate in my life
“Now I got warm cheese baby” 😂
What- Why did you do attempt 2 isn’t attempt one a waste?
Can you drink 50 primes pls😊
what the fuck
My god the advertising 💤
Wait what did u do with take one
First day on this channel,I think this guy has 100 stomachs
How much food you wasted by attempting. 1:28
Please, can someone tell me. How does a small person like this consume that much fat and sodium. And live? Do competitive eaters all purge after? They must man....lol so damn gross.
What happened to the first tray?
Nikoavokodo : Light work no reaction
Me eating my grandma’s cooking :
bro temu is a pyramid scheme
hi Matt! watched for years. When my tummy is packed I take a teaspoon of lemon liquor. It relaxes the guts just enough to take the pain away! Lemoncello..
How are humans capable of doing such thing.
How this guy still skinny
I probably couldn't even eat the part he was left with 🤣🤣
I don't know how you do it, I can't even fathom how you could even demolish half of it
EAT THE FRIES WITH YOUR HANDS
is matt stonie washed up?
YouTube recommendations when i finally decided to start a diet:
You got ya butt whooped smh
what happened to the first tray?
Bro got sponsored by Temu 💀💀💀
Not sure how Matt stays relatively lean after eating like this for the past 10 years, that's the most impressive thing in my eyes
Average american:
ちゃんともう一回やるMatt尊敬😂👍
what a loser can’t even eat 10 pounds of fries
matts belly needs a raise
Half way done at 5 minutes, then finished in over half an hour
Я: переживаю о том, что съела высоко коларийную печеньку Рандомный чел из ютуба:
Pain is temporary pizza fries are forever, next Matt stonie t-shirt?❤️💯🙌🏼
Do he really smallow
bro has the italian army on him rn.
this man never click baited us
Bro is flexing on me soooo hard all that i have eaten in a month is rice
this huge poutine lol
fock China'a Temu. USA's Amazon is MUCH better. Much faster delivery, low prices, and at least an American company even if selling many "Made in China" items (try buying local though!)
temu got so desperate they just had to sponsor him
Could you chug something with badlandchugs sometime that'll be cool?
Welcome back to business matt  Happy to see you as always 😁❤
why the fuck hasn't matt invested into a large heated plate, i swear these challenges would be like 10x more enjoyable for him if he didn't have to worry about food getting cold, and even if they aren't on the market (which im sure they are) he could totally start his own line of heated plates, like youtube's George Foreman, except Matt actually makes sense cuz his whole career is food, George just beat the shit out of people
Id be clogged for a week if i ate that much cheese in one sitting
"Eat to Eat" 👌
TEMU is a trash website.   Dont fall for it.  Rule of thumb.  If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.
Bro where does all this goes
At least you tried plus you ate a lot anyways so be proud of yourself.
*Goku probably: "Finally a worthy opponent... OUR BATTLE WILL BE LEGENDARY!?!?!?!?!?!* ✊🏻
you cant win always Matt. but a good try, almost there. your videos always makes me hungry lol. props for keep doing this. keep up the good works.
Did  you eat the  attempt 1??
Is it bad that I recognized right away they were 5 guys fries
Bro did u waste the previous attempts Cus that is a lot of food wasted
Must be in America
Hi Matt my bf says you vomit your food after eating, is that true? I don’t believe him pls tell me you don’t 🥺🥺🥺
Me : Bro Come online Bro : 5 min, i am eating What bro is eating :-
When you eat like a discord mod but you “touch grass” every day:
😮wonderfull dude
bro lost his ability to eat he sucks now unsubing
where did he learn this?
Man must've came out the womb and said i wanna eat a heart stopping ammount of food when i get older
Lol ads scamming ur own fans.......a new low! It's gambling for kids
I just wanted to see the cheese pour
I see fries. I click
Sometimes I wonder why food prices are getting higher and higher then I see this
hard seeing one of my favorite athletes out of his prime struggling with what used to be easy work
I hope someone ate that first batch
nAiCe
I hope you didn’t throw the first one away! There are people starting out there. What a waste!!
looser tapped out
How do u realise that a person can do this and not die....cause if I could, I would immediately start a utube channel and eat huge amounts of food every 2 weeks as videos like this guy....enjoyment and earning at the same time
Do some Indian challenges
w wasted food
I've been watching your videos from 6 years
*Finely we return old Matt stonie❤*
Your channel turned to Epic Meal Time on CRACK :)))
I thought you could finish it under 30mins.
C'est Alanfoodchallenge le coach ! 😂
True food eater. This was a success
What did he do to the lass one 😮
How do you pull off these kinds of insane amounts of food without getting fat? Do you do fasting or something?
As creative as Pizza Mac and Cheese.
This man is consuming more calories in one meal than some people consume in a week
genuinely where does it all go
Why you eating this like your life depends on it 😭?
Sorry to see how it ended man. Come back stronger
Yeahhhhhhh buddyyyyyy
damn. Couldn't finish it Matt? that's kinda embarrassing. maybe delete the video...
pakistan pizza fries 10x better
Man thats actually a good combo right there with french fries. But the amount is just Stonie level
I hope the first tray didn’t got wasted 😢
Holy shit he couldnt finish? Something aint right
Matt should do a troll video in which he eats a normal size portion of food in a normal amount of time.
I hope you paid the cheese tax!!
@allanfoodchallenge look
It would be fast to use your hands
what happned to the first batch
I got heartburn just looking at that
Does he throw it up after finishing it or is his body has a huge metabolism and workout often?
Give me the same thing, just a smaller portion please. Why do these videos make me wanna crave the food in the video so much ?
❤😂
im a big guy and even i found that disgusting. hope youre okay
YOUR SISTER MAY LIN  SOUNDS HELLA CUTE
fuck man i want to eat that this look so good
This has to be messing up your organs :/
4:02 LMAO, DID HE JUST EAT THE PIECE THAT WAS STILL IN THE PAN 😂😂
I could've done that
Le goat
matt aint in his prime no more
After all of that he still has white counters
i dont feel happy anymore and my life is draining away. I only fill the void with food
Good job. You are not gonna live past 50.
TEMU is chinese BULLSHIT
Awesome 👏
That melted cheese looks amazing on them chips. Makes me want to try this at uome
He's got a chen muscle from eating
I’m genuinely curious how he isn’t fat. If he burns 2000 a day bmr, but eats 20000+ calories a week, he’s in a surplus. He’s not very muscular, so I’m really curious how he’s not fat
You can't do it anymore, you are completely past it and the product is terrible
If he doing attempt 2. Then what he's gonna do the attempt 1
Dem shiba and husky
my Husky do the same sounds over cheese Huskylove4ever
Wow, Matt failed the first attempt, finish eating it off screen and immediately begin the second attempt. What a chad!  To be honest, I think Matt will soon stop uploading videos :\... he is noticeably getting slower, who knows if he slowly start having medical conditions since bulk eating is always bad. The Youtubers that I used to watch slowly disappearing, it's sad... sigh.
How do you manage to lose your weight?
How 2 maintained cholesterol lvl ?
wait why take two where is take one now what  did you just wait food
My fat ass would've wasted no time it💀
Matt stonie you should try the pizza hut melt challenge
You should do the Pocky challenge again, it would be great to revisit your old videos
Bro made every Italian in the world cry
amazing feat to push through and not quit even after water going down the wrong pipe. U will win the rest of the challenges ahead!
5 McDonald grimace shakes!
wish you had edited out the fork scrapping noises on the tray  was like nails on a chalk board levels of painful.
The store is not available in all countries
You should do something like this again but with waffle fries.
' Massive tray of PIZZA FRIES!! (11,706 Calories) ' Spoiler alert, it's an epic fail.
Fake bro sorry
Your stomach right now: WTF bro...😂😂😂
dont temu do sweat shops?
Do a Jersey mikes challenge video 👀
Song when he’s doing the challenge?
How are you still alive that’s my ? That’s a heart attack there but damn
Mattie is b3comin a bih 😂
Taste good.
bro is the new nikado avakado at this point
The pure waste of food just because it didn‘t look good enough on Film the first time and the total bullshit of a sponsor made me dislike one of your videos for the first time! Hope this isn‘t a regular occurrence on here
I hope you had friends to share the first tray with. I wouldn't have minded 2000Kcal worth of your Pizza Fries.
Bro ate enough calories for a week in a half hour
How is this the only big eater who never gains weight lol
All those fries from 5 guys was probably like $400😭😭😭🤣
You're losing your touch, Stonie. That's what selling out and being a shill will do to you.
Bros plumber, probably the richest man on earth
Bro didn't even open the headphones packaging so thats how I know it's a scam😂
If skipping the part where he advertises something, hit like.
why is Matt stonie sponsoring temu scam
I've never felt so sick in my life, imagine him
I have a challenge for you Matt! Hear me out.... But you should eat 6 bags of blue heat Takis all in 30mins without milk or anything to soothe the burns. After the 30 mins you wait 10mins with no water, no milk, no ice cream, and no ice. (you can drink coke but it would hurt more) Good Luck if you try this!   P.s Love your contenttttt ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Did he just waste one whole tray?
bro i wish i could eat at least a quarter of how much matt could eat…
Africain poeple réaction to his fail first try 😢
I love how I saw the fries and instantly knew they were from five guys
How do you not get heart burn
When she said it’s only that much left that’s like a order bruh 😂
What if theres a secret catch when u sign up for temu. Idk, seems sketchy
What's the song in the last part of this video?
God pray for his toilet
How the hell do you not have diabetes?! This kid crushes food like a train hitting a coke can
What I would do for this man to cook moderate sized meal portions for me to eat along with him😭😭
What's sad is it probably took Stonie longer to cook it than eat it😂😂
Temu is js like wish 🤦‍♂️
What a trooper!
Pain is temporary Pizza fries are forever                  _ Matt Stonie 2023

Imagine if he was lactose intolerant
You should try it again! I think you could beat your time for sure!

خدای من پسر تو دیوونه هستی 😅

F'n stupid...I don't care about time. I'd just enjoy eating the goddamn food and still finishing it all. Stupid.
That's amazing ❤😎
You should try the epic meal time 10 minute kfc challenge again to see if you can beat it now

All you need in life is pizza 🍕 😊
Matt stone lost his mojo...... unsubscribed
What happened to the first set of food???
Prend exemple Allan
You gotta pour and pull bruh
I was surprised that he did a challenge with this amount of fries because he always says he hates fries in those challenges
You don't finish anything how do you have so many followers I guess is you trying that counts. No judgment Great Content
Hope the first try wasn’t wasted😢
How has no one made any memes with this??

You need to put more pepperoni on their there was plenty of room for more pepperoni
the water fucked u up
I could eat that in a day, but not 30 minutes
I don't know what that orange cheese was but it is not the same as British cheddar.
What happens if you use honey and temu at the same time???
better than allan food challenge
4:23 eating starts here
When Matt took the tray up in his hands, I KNEW IT WAS BOUTTA GET INTENSE IN HERE so I had to bring my sweater
Months of waiting....for this?......going back to Joel's channel, sorry matt
Why just tomato sauce and not actual pizza sauce tho
Usually the food looks appetizing, this looks plain brutal. I'm not a fan of tomato sauce though.
What will happen to the first attempt  is it going to the waste😢
wow a tapout havent seen that that i can recall from the mega toad
Massive trays are the best meals alive😊
Me when I come home from work
#advertwanker
Your losing your touch old stonie would of smashed this
You didn’t pull back. Lactose is too much
Try the grimace shake
Я бы обосрался. У тебя там собака жрать хочет
Matt is in a three way with his gf and toilet seat 😂
POV Americans diet:
Please redo old challenges!! Like the 14lbs Big Mac!!!

Megan was mad with a hat
i think bro is washed
Please do not support TEMU  They are under investigation by the US governement for selling slave-made products, and are a generally shitty company
Please tell me you didn't waste the first tray of fries because they didn't "look right"
FAKE
you are 100x better than the fraude monumentale alanfood
Are those five guys fries?
Somebody knows if this dude plays drums?
In France, the guy Alan Food Challenge just fake his challenge 6 Giga French Tacos. (every bites were cut), yesterday he did a livestream ton answer every question about his fake videos and do another challenge, eating 2 "gigas tacos" that had nothing to do with the ones in the videos. And the worst thing is that he admits himself that it was to act out a scenario... Etc. On top of all that, this idiot comes up with the excuse that there are worse mistakes to be made, such as demonstrations over the death of a guy.  In short, this kind of shit that fakes videos isn't worth it.   Thanks to you for shining a spotlight on the bums who make money by taking the piss out of their community.  ps: and he has admitted to faking 3 or 4 videos.   Ps2: he had taken part in a challenge with a big youtubeur for a challenge, he failed of course by telling him he had eaten 2 hours before.   Here's the youtuber in question: @aLanFoodChallenges  And here's the one who proved it.  @TheoMalini
WHY DIDN'T HE PARTICIPATE AT NATHAN'S HOT-DOG CONTEST???
At 6:35 the dog was hungry Matt bro lol 😆
I don't understand... isnt this like.. life threatening??.. how tf does he counter balance all that unhealthy food he just ate????

You should try again but this time use pizza sauce or spaghetti sauce, instead of plain old tomato sauce. probably would have more flavor.
Here is food challenge ideas  Grimace meal challenge includes grimace shake  Boneless chicken challenge  Smoothies challenge  Quarter pound hot dog challenge  Deli sandwich challenge

Alan fumié
A sa c'est pas Alan 😉😉😉
This fucker doesnt get old man
Time to retire before you quit in every challenge🙌 We know it's only for the sake of sponsorship.
@ this point @mattstonie beats every challenge there so he has to make his own challenges😂
Pour remplacer Alan 😮??
Dogs look at 0:44 😂😂
Alan il te fume matin et soir😂
Lui il cut pas
It's a genius idea, and a delicious one too! OwO
Mieux que Alan food challenge
YOU FUCKING QUITER!!!! Just kidding. You did well, considering the mass, and liquids. 💯
I take one bite of those fries and im nick avocado
Toi au moins t’es pas alan goat
@TheoMalini vient le debunk lui au cas ou 😂
I can feel the heartburn ❤😢
Almost, man!!!! Watched this one with my son. He loves your channel
Back in my days matt stonnie completed all his challenges 😂.
i know you guys ate the first tray right?
Bon qui est venu regarder le GOAT après le procès d'AlanFoodChallenge ?
Ofcourse there's a significant amount of tray showing if you scoop it all to the middle.
Temu is a scam.
Bro did a take 2 just coz that 1st attempt looked okay like-
Could you do 5 Giga tacos ?
Lui au moins cest pas du tout fake pas comme un certain challenger dont je citerai pas le nom😑
What happened to the First Tray of Fries? Did U eat them by urself or did U share it?😄
temu is literally child slavery. nice cash grab. hope you feel good spending it,..
Them fires look good ass hell
C’est autre chose que cette fraude dalan
Pfdrrr ya que des coms recents sur alanfakechallenge
can you eat 5 gigatacos plz
Es tu une fraude comme Alan Food ? 🧐 Ou est la poubelle Matt ??? Dis le aux abonnés !!
boo (im from indonesia)
Çok iyi
Your dogs are so cute
What a stupid waste of food
5:09 eat to eat???
I know its not good for food challenges, but i would prefer steak-cut fries/wedges to the soggy flaccid thin fries that were used here.    Props Matt for scarfing them down as best as possible!
Lui c'est pas une fraude comme Alan
Did u know Alanfood challenge ?
How are not growing weight after all that many calories in takes.. 🤔
Yo, huge respect to Matt Stonie for surviving 31 years, with out a heart attack.
Lots of calories and matt still skinny
I feel so bad for his dog. He's probably never had left overs😂
Your getting old Food is defeating you. You can't handle it anymore sooner or later your going to have to throw in the towel!! Your NOT the same heavy eater Matt Stonie!!!
a serious friendly curiosity question, does food become addiction for competitive  eaters,  like when people get hooked on working out . totally different  things but does any one get me? what is a regular food of eating like? does your stomache get used to eating a massive amount of food? what happens if you stop? bc it just randomly came up to my mind, since ive seen you matt stonie , raine huang, molly schlar, and joel eat alot of food? long question sorry but im genuinely curious how it works in the daily life and health.
Alan foodhallenge prend des notes !!
takes months to post then only leaves an 8 min vid for ads and goofy sponsores, bro sold out
Lost a lot of respect for you for having such a scam as a sponsor.
please weigh yourself before and after your eating challenges.
That was an amazing try matt...you will try again ....and succeed
Fun Fact: Temu is involved in child labor and spyware spread to devices to collect data
Getting old EMT vibes haha, minus the heaps of bacon lmfao.
Food look too good the way you eating it🤣🤣
Matt can you speed eat a meatloaf? One love ✌️
That sponsor was painful to watch! Love Matt’s videos, but… goodness
If this was me it would be done in 2 minutes😂😂
Lui c'est le vrai pas alan mdrr
Are those five guys’ fries?
YOU EAT 20000 CALORIES IN A DAY ABOUT 6 YEARS AND I AM SEEING THIS VEDIO AFTER 6 DAYS😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I swear to you… temu is like wish
he definitely likes french fries
Alan FoodChallenge fraude
Aside from the quantity, that looks damn good!!!!
❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉😀
First one was better
2:00 Temu is just like Wish
Luv❤the vid,just to much skippin'😢
He should speed eat a big bowl of vegetables.
It isn't real when you edit
You guys are giving Nikocado Avocado new mukbang ideas
Matt: *eats 11,000 calories at once and loses weight*  Me: *eats 500-1,000 mostly healthy calories a day and works out and literally gains weight*  I need your metabolism 😩😩😩😩😩
Stonie100 no longer valid
When you're on a diet and see this video
you have been lazy on making new videos, your fans need more,more moooore :) whoop whoop
Temu sponsor?
What a disappointment
So many people keep om asking me to download temu so they can get free stuff. Now Matt is telling us to download Temu.
So jealous ur not fat from these eating habits
I mean, he tried
Fail...
Mr stonie u should do the wingstop sandwich challenge eat all 12 chicken sandwiches
ça change d'alan food challenge
#alanfoodchallenge
damn this looks so delicious, my mouth is watering and the intro didnt even finish
How many days don't u eat after that???
i just know you be BLOWING up your toilet 😂
how are you even alive bro 😂
Person: I only eat 100 callories a day. Matt: Hold my beer!
Pls eat 10 wendys T rex burgers in 10 min
Matt is the 8th wonder of the world
How bro skinny?
@Lion Cry watching this
lookin for a different kinda pizza
I would be shoving this is my face rn
How you can’t fat? Are you Atlantic?
I would probably die after eating that. Also, you probably shouldn’t promote slave labour.
Do the kfc full menu challenge again that you did 4 years ago
C pas alan ca
I missed this  massive amounts and just ultimately pushing yourself great content
You gotta try the Michael Phelps diet again 😅
Au moins il assume de ne pas pouvoir terminer pas comme chez nous avec Alan food challenge 😅😅
what happen to the first pizza????
no way you can keep eating like that.
How much TEMU paid you 💀💀
Can you eat 5 French Gigatacos ? 🤣
I love the stuff you do matt but please stop doing Promos for companies like Temu, they are just against everything the world needs to sustain. Its morally not justifiable to partner up with such
Eriktheelectric be like: Pff ROOKIE..
He is doing some trick. its impossible
Make a Dutch “kapsalon”
I wonder how many days he doesnt eat after a challenge
This guy should be 60 years old by now. Someone stop him before he get colon cancer.
Walmart Epic meal time 😂
Great effort eating that. But why? I respect your mad eating skills but I dunno if its worth watching. What do I know 1.7m people have watched it is so maybe my comment isn't worth posting. Really liked your earlier content btw. Previous competitions or events you entered. Now its seems kinda pointless. Kinda like that avocado guy, with less crying.
TEMU is a big scam and their under investigation
its so funny to think some kid in africa could watch this and be hungry.
I hope the first attempt one was being consumed and not thrown in waste🥺
What happened to the first one, he better not have wasted it
I give props to his parents for teaching him to never waste food
🔥💯
Alan food challenge is the best ! Tu peux pas test ( merci @theo Malini )
Anyone else notice the 2 lonely fries just sitting casually on the table
What a healthy meal
Looks amazing lol
Wow
You only upload one video a month and you can't finish the food? you disappoint me
Últimamente me decepcionas
I think the best part about this, is that Matt is going to see his time later on down the road, and redo it while smashing his old Time by at least half
So sad to see you premote Temu...
You eat like Goku and Luffy combined
what the hell is temu man
I'd be interested in a "what I eat the rest of the week" vid. How do you balance  out 11k calories??
Qui est venu vérifié les vidéos de Matt Stonie pour voir si il faisait comme Alan mdrrrrrr
“Sometimes all you need in life is child labour and cheap shit” - temu
me on the day before my period:
Matt using a fork? That's new
Huge shout out to who using the toilet next
Could you imagine if this guy worked out??? Modern day Goku.
the dogs ears
No lie you have alot of $ and food to waste while people oit there habe none....
More respect for the honesty at the end, can't win them all.
I ate pizza watching this, was hoping you would completely finish. Great effort, though! Looked delicious!!
No me lo creo
My guy is worn out… can’t do that forever
Allan food la fraude
This shit would help bulk my skinny ass
Cause pigs don’t sweat so they got a bunch of toxins in them and that’s why pepperoni is terrible for you
matt stonie we love you
Dude has the same thing I got 😅 we can eat *THAT MUCH* for *SO LONG* and we still stay lookin *Lean / Skinny / Slim* it’s like we invincible to food affecting our bodies *weight wise* tho… on the normal eating like this would get ppl gainin pounds & gettin fat quick like for example that NikoCado Dude (& btw mad respect that he dialed down on his weight & he got even better than where he was before on his journey to lose them pounds 🙌🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾)  but anywho yeah I know if I ate up this much like dude did here on this channel then I’d still be lookin the same 🤷🏾‍♂️ 😂😅 (I can’t really do that cuz I don’t have much space to eat up like this but if I did I betcha after 10 years of doin this I’d still be super slim like I am now 🥲😭)
I love to see you doing these challenges and they are just awesome great work and please keep it up
Enjoy the food😢
Enjoy the food😢
upload videos every day
Qui est la après la fraude de Alan food challenge
I get so hungry when I watch your videos wtf
If Matt dies one day, at least we'll know why.
Weird rant but, something about your face looks more manly. Not really sure what it is but you went from Matt stonie to Mathew Stone 😂
Can you do seafood?
Grandma's favorite child
Pain is temporary Pizza fries are forever -Matt Stonie
Part of me wants to eat it, another part fills sick, and the other part would rather eat the pizza by itself.
personally I wouldve dunked my hands in the fries and ate
Not the temu sponser lmao, literal scam/spyware website
Doesn’t upload like he use to and he doesn’t finish his challenges? What happened Matt?
What you do with your first attempt pizza frice
Man how does blud always survive this delicious ahh bulls*** 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
couldve gonee way faster with hands over the fork
The Mother of all pours. The M.O.A.P
What did you do with the first attempt? Did you waste all that food?
Eat a 20cal pizza or unsub
id personally like to know how you stay healthy after these videos^^
why do the fries look old and burnt XD
Good video but Matt needs to do more research on the sponsorships hes gonna do. Temu is under investigation and is almost certainly a chinese spy ware. ( The parent company of Temu was found to contain Chinese malware and spyware. Temu needs to have a way to fund all these items through something other than ads. presumably the sale of the data of the people who use their app. ) TLDR; Don't use temu, Probably spyware and probably gets its items from Chinese sweat-shops.
no ones talking about that hes eating fries with a fork
Hands up if you didn’t know what pizza fries were before watching this vid
Taps out with less than 5% left nooooooo
Bruh wtf? You've gotten slower and doing wayy smaller portions. Clearly something is lacking.
what happend to the first version?
After months finally posts a vid and it’s a fail. Good job stonie..
i would love to see the behind the seans of competitiv eating like how long did you starve your self before eating
Temu is a scam
Lui au moins il mange
One thing I realized today is matt stonie looks good too... Till now I was only looking at how he eats 😅
His Heart: If you don't stop, I'll stop.
This just made me hungry, :<
Time To Addsworld
become fat
5guys fries are the best
Assaulting your own stomach🤦‍♂️
bruh matt stonie is getting rusty mane
Wanna see him do a Asian dish
You should prepare coffin 😂
R.I.P toilet, he was a brave soldier to survive matt’s nuke on the way into it. He will always be in our heart, but not really.
My mom:would you eat this? Me right now:
I wonder if he gets constipated from eating so much cheese
Just watching this whole thing would give me a coronary.
Matt’s toilet: No please I have a family
YOU ARE THE GOAT
Ain't no way he went and got all that shit again cause the pour wasn't good enough I hope to God he didn't just toss that shit out
I used to eat bacon cheese fries and get smashed drunk at the bowling alley every week.. It made me hate cheese fries.. watching this was a challenge in itself for me. I was getting sick with you, lmao.
You honestly could've still eaten the first one 😅
Dam I thought u would finish at 10 but u slowed down alot  pls reply stonie
Stonie needs to get out of his basement, molly would have been done in 5 mins.
Matt, you should attempt the massive cookie bowl with ice cream challenge again, but this time actually do it when it's warm so it's not so difficult to eat!
U should follow beard guy and go around country and eat that
Did he throw away the first batch waste the food?
Oh no matt promoting child labor from china
Noooo. Don't work with Temu. They're bad...
All cool, except fuck temu.
that looks really good

No other competitive food person cant complete it if this dude cant
I think you should try it again
The fork scraping the tray. Really hurt my teeth 😢 lol
First non-Short in over two months...
He should have hit that sauce with some seasoning. 😋
double italian poutine
Shout out to Matt for never swallowing to not waste the food
Try a massive plate of ASADA FRIES…
Can you do a video of your blood reports so that the audience knows how fit you are even after eating so much calories   Also your workout routine would be great for people aiming fat loss  Thank you
HOW DARE YOU PROMOTE TEMU
Mission failed, He's Losing his touch 👎
I believe you can do this
The terrorists hate our freedom? I HATE OUR FREEDOM. This is all we've done with it? We're fucking assholes man. - David Cross
Is temu actually legit😭
Indian grandmas asking you to eat more food be like:
u ever been to Five Guys? that is a small fry, cheese, and a side of ketchup
Where can i buy a matt stonie bracelet?
In which situation I am watching I can finish those fries and eat tray as well, man I am starving😭😭
Dog at 6:28: Are you sure you don't need me to help?😂
This is a load of crap
My guy getting older.
weak
You are an animal man, I'm a fat little shit and I couldn't even finish that off
Anyone know why stonie hasn't competed in fourth of July hot dog eating contest lately?
yuck just tomato sauce? no salt or seasoning?
I know me some five guys fries when I see them
So like did u eat the first attempt?
what  is wrong with those fries bud, they look overbaked and old
this is like eating all the toppings off a cake and leaving the cake! 😂
Matt vs Nick Who is gonna have a real heart attack first?
MMMMMHHH ANOTHER HUGE PİZZA
the next video should be the diet of the world’s heaviest ever man ‘Walter Hudson’, according to an article this was his diet : Hudson described his average daily diet as consisting of two boxes of sausages, 1 pound (0.45 kg) of bacon, 12 eggs, and a loaf of bread for breakfast, four hamburgers, four double cheeseburgers and five large portions of fries for lunch, and three large ham steaks or two chickens, four baked potatoes, four sweet potatoes, four heads of broccoli, and most of a large cake for dinner. He also had additional snacks, and drank an average of 237 oz / 1.9 gallon / 7 liters of soda every day.[2]  However this may kill Matt and i dont want to be held accountable for his demise
No seasoning in the tomato sauce , that sauce with no seasing is 🤮
Wow this guy is still alive , shocked he hasn’t had a heart attack by now
Timu looks like a scam website :0
I'm getting arrythmia just from watching 💀
Temu selling fakes and shit quality stuff
is that an arous product right there 3:20
He's falling off
This video gives me 2018 Matt Stonie’s vibes
does he just puke it up after?
Did anyone get the coupon or the headset? I cant find them
Unbelievable how no one is looking at the fucked Garfield he had sitting next him
You should also give out some food to the poor people as well God will bless you
yeah, code didnt work
you threw away the first one?
Bro organ’s is suffering 😮😮
Do something with beard meets food
Finally he is back the OG
Give me a blunt and I’ll finish that in 10 minutes
That was Five Guys fries, dude did not go cheap $$
Bro can eat earth too

Big respect to Matt and his plumber
Finally a new video.  Been waiting forever.
Your HIM
what did you do with the first one
😮wooow
idk man i feel like joel hansen wouldve smashed this
I cant believe it! My hero! the one and only Matt Stonie did not finish this challenge.... I am not going to lie I thought there was nothing he couldn't do! I have seen a lot of his videos and every time I watch one he ALWAYS finishes what is in front of him, it was incredible! I am humbled to watched this video and I realise that not only could he not finish it I honestly think there wouldn't be many if any that could... Well done Matt! you my friend are an absolute legend! After seeing this comment I challenge you to resit this attempt and show us all why you are the best competitive champion eater of the world!! Woop Woop!
Anyone else get hungry watching Matt stonie?
Sharing is caring you know
I dare you to try the grimace shake 10x in 30 minutes

I see u beat so Many Challenges. Its ok To Loose a couple. U not getting any Younger Mr. Stonie, even though your Baby face will Force u To ID anorher 40Yrs

I got heartburn from watching this
Missed you at Nathan's Matt! Glad to see this glorious challenge still!
italian not like this video

If you don’t finish you can’t get up from table
The unholy of them all see this is why anyone loves matt stonie he does the impossible and not even gaining fat

Bruhs gallbladder getting nuked 😂
Not to hate on this guy, but I haven't seen gain a fat unlike other YouTuber who does this thing. But nonetheless, respect.
Idk i have an addiction to food vids thats what has helped me through my weight loss journey
Temu is a pyramid scheme.
Dude was passionate about this sponsor lol
This guys still going crazy
their dogs are very cute✨
am i tripping or is the screen glitched on the pizza drop
om nom nom
bro is sponsored by temu😂 ik I can’t be the only one thinking this
Did Matt retire from Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest?
Wow bro couldn’t even finish the tray 😅 I could beat every one of his records
Dang!!!!  Looks bomb though lol 😊🍕🍟
Great video thank you for another upload, We hope to see you at the 2024 Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest and beat Joey Chestnut. Who agrees ???
"Pain is temporary pizza fries are forever"   - matt stonie
Espero no hayas tirado la comida del primer intento, por qué eso no sería muy responsable de tu parte
Why aren't you in the hot dog contest anymore?
i wont lie this guy has more elegance when eating then mukbags
How does he not get fat tho ? Ion understand what’s his secret
I need Raina and Stonie to collaborate
Fuuuuuuuuuuu
don’t forget the 6
“Pain is temporary, but pizza fries are forever”. That quote is real.
62 cents? Something is not right there
What did you do to the first batch of fries ?
Did he really just waste all that food because the cheese didn’t fall correctly…?😐
Watching your video and doing push ups 🤟
Is Temu just the new wish?
i thought matt had a husky lmao
What did you do with the first tray😭😭
Finally a new video. Love your vids man. Keep it up
Honestly though in a more moderate amount that looks like it would be so good XD
great video mistah stonie, curios if the miss made fry cheese pizza thing is still available to eat. thanks
I think the italians will hate you from doing this. 😳
YO MATT BIG FAN ID LOVE TO SEE YOU DO THE CHALLENEG AT FUNKY FRIES AND BURGERS IN SANDIEGO I BET YOU'D ROCK IT MUCH LOVE !!!!!!
What did you did with the first batch 👀👀👀?   I hope you didn’t throw it in the trash
Why use a small fork over like a big plastic spoon?
how is this man alive
How the hell he's so thin
Did he waste the first round of Food?
His toilet is having a bad time after this one
He is here again  man you are the best
Respect for Matt stonie, man can eat everything I eat but like x500
Is it just me, or the stonie100 code doesn't work :( I tried on pc and also on the app.
Day 1 one asking matt to try to eat all of the one chip challenges
French frie intoxication! 😆
L stonie he washed now can’t even finish 5 large fries smh
I will eat those mashed potatoes and gravy in a matter of seconds
matt i cant order to estonia sad
Even the dogs like bruh I wouldn't eat that as it's going in the oven😂
Why was a 2nd attempt needed? Food looked better.
Damn thats gotta be the most fishiest sponsor ever😢
Dès que je suis au régime je regarde direct tes vidéos Matt💪
That's a weird poutine
is temu actually decent quality tho ?
better then hot dogs I guess?
It’s always the water that goes down the wrong pipe and makes you choke
i know those 62 cent headphones dont even work lmao
w  vid
The goat is back
Where did the other fries go on the first attempt??
I hope you took some fiber 😂😂
A month for this?
The pour was satisfying but YUCK 🤢
Cant wait for Italian people reacting to these
Mans would of finished this with ease couple years ago
Use more organic ingredients Matt,  the challenge is cool but the extras in the food make it so scary
Actually looks awesome but I cant eat anything pizza related without lots of Tabasco sauce on the top lol
Wow we waited this long just for a disappointing fail. What a joke
You waited way too long, that’s all your fault it didn’t work 😂😂
W
how the heck you eat so much and you still skinny
Temu Is a scam
Missed your on the 4th. Wish you would have done the hotdog competition. I think you could have won this year.
The megatoad never leaves a challenge defeated! Rematch?
damn, stone toad hurting since that ramen
The smallest strongman snack:
If u tap one more time, Morgan is officially better eater than u
you gotta do a challenge with beardmeetsfood!
🤤🍕🍟
TEMU is a Chinese company that exploits small Chinese companies to sell their items at a loss.
Guys on their first bulk
Ta ficando tão fraco decepcionada
"Eat to Eat" hmm
It is look delicious fries and pizza cheese. Amazing challenge Matt.
Temu is sketchy and some of their stuff is a scam! Don’t use it
no way he sold out to TEMU
Why didn’t you do the hot dog eating contest?
that's a tough L to take man, wasn't expecting that
I would have put some seasoning on the tomato sauce.
You need Bodybuildin
Deception :(
Stop trying so hard to be cute :/
Tomato sauce though?
Does anybody know what he does after killing all that food? Sleep? Walk 5miles? Take a big poo? I've always wondered..
Be careful with Temu seems to be scamy
the video was fine up until the ad
i love cheese
matt stonie nightamre: braces
Respect from Russia
Bruh every time Matt posts a new video his plumber must hate him
Damn it what the hell are you made of
It infuriates me that you took the cheese out of the oven before the fries were even spread out ready 😂😂😂
Bro I hate metal on metal sounds... hurts me to my core... try a wooden or plastic next time to help me not cringe so hard lol
At least he didnt waste food
The Matt Stonie I know would have crushed the no problem.
Yay new video
Bro really did a take #2
Omg, why are you doing this to your stomach?!
there was truly nothing wrong with that first tray
will you compete in the 4th of july hot dog eating contest next year?
Bro you and beardmeetsfood should collab and do a 2 person food challenge. You guys are insane
Bro has hachiko in the background 🐕
Temu is a scam bro.....
We all agree chili and cheese is better tho right?
Perfect food pour 🎉. You almost made it but it’s okay, try your best next challenge 🙏
Sause
How do you actually eat this much. We are practically built the same, how did you start man
Guy is living his dream like Shaggy
When u r on bulk 🤓😵‍💫🤢
Kimetsu no yaiba
I was looking for him at the hotdog contest this year and I was sad he wasn't there
Just the fries alone looked mad good
💯💯💯💯💯
Cool vid but the sponsor is a scam site so buy at your own risk
In my opinion, these things are gross
That sound of the fork scraping the tray though
You're slipping in your old age.  I feel like a few years ago you would of had that easy.  I feel like Beard Meats Food could do that.
I'm italian...
those look like five guys fries because of the large fry cup
It's not like the old video where you eat everything lately you don't eat it all you jst doing video for money now
didnt even show the pour properly smh
Try 5 grimace shakes
u getting weaker boi
Just plain tomato sauce straight out the can?
TEMU IS ONLY IS NOT WORLDWIDE??
Ppl wonder why there’s a food shortage
R.I.P to mankind hello aliens
Oh god the scraping sounds of the metal 💀
Hey matt why didn't you join hotdog competition?
Thats not a stomach, thats a damn Doraemon magic pocket
This is literally the first video of yours I’ve watched, and I have a few points. 1-what happened to the first round of fries? 2-the ad was so long 😅 definitely skipped my way through it 3-that second pour was so seductive with the different camera angles 😂 I will watch more 👍🏼
so he makes great looking for food - and then he eats all of it . i like it imma sub
What happened to the first one?
Those fries looks like they've been to oven hell cause they look burnt.
At least we didn't have to listen to Morgan's incoherent mumbling
nikoadvocado eats food *gains Weight* Matt stonie eats food *lose weight*
Lil bro rly takes every shitty sponsor he gets offered so sad to see some money hungry goblin who posts once every 3 months only to get his sponsor money, guss its time to finally unsub
I know shit was salty asf
What a chump! Used to be a legend, but now he's not anymore. He's gotten soft.
The old Matt would’ve did this in 15 min.  Merely just a shell of your old self. Lol just kidding.
Make video about that dog. Is it shiba?
Yet amberlynn Reid is over here claiming she's eating 1600 cals per day and is somehow 550lb..
I love Cheeeeeeze please give me a heart attack amount!
Would you like salt with your salt, Sir?
Stonie failing challanges is the new trend
Yikes not Temu
Love you men ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
maybe do it without editing would be better.
Matt's toilets have been suffering for over 5 years😥
really fucking temu
Brother , You are every indian grandmother dream child😂😂😂
tbh it looks like a pizza
That fork scraping the metal pan is making cringe😂
Any temu scam crazy
well i hope you dont die
Dislike for the Temu app
Bruh the dogs want to be living his life eating a job
I’m hoping that first attempt’s food didn’t go to waste
Why doesn't he compete in Nathan's anymore? Really sucks.
this would send gordon ramsey to the hospital.
I don't understand how a person could hold so much food in them. He must do edits so he can pause to puke.
How many grilled cheese can you eat?
Why didnt you go to nathans?
i mean he does a lot of this stuff but, he really is killing him self here
what happened to the first tray?
my lactose intolerance 😃😃
That my friend is a self inflicted wound 😂cold cheese and acid from sauce double whammy lots of luck 🤞 next challenge 👏👍🙏😂
Ill watch this on a empty stomach . Smh
I was like, “The next cut will be a gag, the next cut will be a gag.”     *I was right*
if nikocado sees this, he will enjoy it.
Dude you are so my hero.
I always use wonder why people say "went down the wrong pipe " while choking if they only supposed to have one way down for food ... however i do get that its a expression but the accuracy i guess sometimes.....
We miss old Matt Stonie😢
Unlucky lil bro matt ditched his best buddy/cameraman/goat of this channel , for a girl. Been boring since then ...
You should definitely try the daddy daves challenge
if you wasted that entire first tray due to aesthetics you are not as cool as I thought you were. - 100 respect
i want some
Matt scraping the trey with the fork made me literally wanna rip my ears off every time it happened lmao
Why is this guy so slim? It’s not fair 🤣🤣
My stomach was growling just from seeing Matt eat 💀
7:17 😭😭😭💀💀💀
Am I the only one wondering why he didn't use a jarred pasta sauce or pizza sauce rather than 2 plain unseasoned tomato sauces that usually are the base of making sauce from scratch? He can afford the real high end ones like Raos, Michael's of Brooklyn, Cucina Antica Marinara, Hoboken Farms, Il Mulino Sauce, Don Pepino pizza sauce or La San Marzano Marinara. Mid range Barilla, Bartoli, Lidia's Marinara, Botticelli Premium sauce, Victoria.. Reasonably priced Newman's Own Marinara, prego, classico, Rinaldi or hell even Store brands like Great Value would have been better than what he used lol Before someone bites my head off and say it'd be too salty with the fries and cheese they all come in low sodium options.  But aside from that love watching Stonie take on massive food challenges.
Stupid water, messed him up!
If you ever feel useless, remember that Matt Stonie has a digestive system.
You can see him expand like a balloon through out the video 😅  What a legend though, i could never do that 👍
Pls try grimace shake💀
temu scamming?
I would have put the fries in the pan while the pizza was cooking
You ruined those fries lol :P
Did they just throw the first batch away?
Fry drunk. 😬🍟
🥲I know this man didn’t use tomato sauce when he coulda used pizza sauce or marinara
Yo @mattstonie please don't collaborate with TEMU, They've done some pretty bad stuff.
Where were you today. Not eating hot dogs :/
Why does it feel like you drink air when you drink low calories powerade?  Any one ? Please , hello
You used walmart cheese bro. That don't melt lol
That had to be the saltiest thing I’ve ever witnessed
Your gonna die early 40’s
Whats happenin after? I mean it goes from down butt or vomit?
Where are all those videos you promised
Major props for not cheating or cutting corners to make it look like a win. It was close enough! Mad respect
Me watching this with a sore throat 😢
Do the grimace Shake
WHERE WERE YOU TODAY AT THE HOTDOG EATING CONTEST?   WACK!!!!!
This guy is not gonna live that long IF he keeps eating like this
Matt stonie is the real one which could use the sentence Im so hungry i could eat a whole supermarket.😂
NOOOO TEMU GOT MY BOY
Sometimes in life all you need is a massive tray of cholesterol and a diet Coke to wash it down
Did he do the hotdog eating contest ?
he didnt finish cuz he got sponsored by temu
Those look like 5 guys fries
How does this man not have any life threatening health problems
I thought you gave up on the channel.
Bro id like to see you go to a doctor after one of these challenges. Not because I think you're unhealthy, but just to see how your body reacts to such a massive amount of food.
Matt why weren’t you at the Nathan’s hot dog contest
🍕fries, tasty...tho, ur hair2:23-2:24 Dude! :)
where is the old stoonie :(
Matt from 5 years ago wouldve taken 10 minutes.
Matt stonie got soft over the years. Back in the day it was actually exciting, now its just meh. No real motivation. He failed so many challenges.
that heart burn is bouta be your downfall...
why don’t u use your hands
Ive been waiting for a video 😭
What did u do with the other fries and pizza
Yoo that's not good quality fries
sorry matt but i cant believe your ruining five guys fries like that 😭looks good but just why on the five guys heavenly fries
A Temu ad, really?
Tenu is not good
Its been really long since he actually completed a challenge... good old Matt is waaaay long gone but I still enjoy his videos
i feel like this is the first challenge matt doesn't go in with his hands
Love them eating videos 😊
It's a shame how commercialized he's got. 1/4 of this video is nothing but ads, and less than half of it is the actual challenge. I understand everyone needs money but as a viewer this is disappointing.
He throughout after this video
Bro how are you not getting fat lol
I didn't realize he had a Shiba Inu. I  had one as a kid. Intelligent dogs that are harder to train than most other breeds. I was able to name her Mew.
Are you crazy? You make getting a large order of some carne asada fries look so easy.
What happened to the first tray
Imagine being vegan and thinking you make a diference when this man literally eats for 10 of them xD
Temu is the new wish lol
You gonna die
I'm so addicted to Matt Stonie content!
PAIN IS TEMPORARY, PIZZA FRIES ARE FOREVER!
This man used plain tomato sauce! Not even a pizza sauce or marinara! Blasphemy! ❤
super wasteful starting again...
THE PIZZA FRIES LOOK DELICIOUS!
U are washed up
✌️ 👑
That fork on a tray screech had me dying but great vid as always❤️😖
“Chepparoni” xD
Not really feeling the sponsor of this video. It's very distasteful in light of everything that has happened lately. Would you gladly accept a sponsorship from Shein as well? It's so out of touch with reality..
Temu is a scam 💀💀🤔
Respect for his toliet
You should try a multi-cultural challenge. Eat a traditional dish from different parts of the world in one meal
i like how he made the worst of 2 worlds using the best fries and the worst tomato cheese and pepperoni
I feel bad for the plumber when it all comes out😢
How on earth you don’t get sick after eating stuff like that I would instantly be sick after
Ssup a tahw
literally unsubscribing after your terrible decision to promot crap product chinese scam website
NO way you just accepted a chinese scam sponsor.
Man you could beat Joey why aren’t you there
The most american thing I’ve ever watched. Great way to kick off 4th of July
Mans kitchen got bad vibes in it
Wasting food and then not finishing the 2nd 1. Poor form.
100$? If that site was affidable i would go in it 2:52
5:43 "pain is temporary... pizza fries are forever" - Matt Stonie 2023 👽🥴
Makes me want pizza
I hate the wrong pipe thing.  Makes me feel like an idiot too.
3am meal idea
vorrei sapere se la sua cacca puzza
I give props to his parents for teaching him to always finishing his food
Who else is watching this on a diet? 🙀
Bruhhhhh😮
Fat makes you fuller faster.  You probably could've done it if you replaced the cheese with something else.
Buddy got so stoned in preparation to eat this he put the oven mitt on for the cold pan 🤣
I use to like Matt till I grew up an realized this is just as bad as a heroin addiction
Only 11,000 calories?
Tell me ur desperate temu
Bro was constipated for the next 18 years
16 million subs to watch you just munch..Holy cow ...you are a beast.
Wrong hole 🤣
Been asking Matt for 4 years to do a 4 for 4 from Wendy’s still nothing
every obese persons dream:
Y’all should get a heat gun and reheat it on the counter
God my mouth is literally Niagra Falls rn and I don’t know why
How long do you have to wait until your videos go from snap to YouTube?
Matt, please do a big ass salad next time, just so it's healthy
Matt I CALLENGE YOU to eat either 6 pounds of chicken and yellow rice OR six pounds of chicken and dumplins in ONE sitting are you up for the challege?? The only rule is if you walk away from the table you loose
You ruined this video with the in video ads...
Dawg 11,000 calories? Give this to the flash
Alan food challenge le fait ?
Wow, he quit 😔
That’s really unfortunate that you accepted the temu sponsor. It’s a gigantic privacy  reach website
Watching Matt Stonie while staying at the hospital with a loss of appetite to get my appetite back is the best.
Joey Chestnut could finish that in 15 min
It's been some time since I watched mattstonie like a couple years 👽💀 that's crazy
Are the fries from five guys?
does the frues get better flavour wise , with all the stuff ? im not really sure
Im starting to feel like stonie doesn't have the stomach for this anymore
You didnt eat all sorry matt :*
bro you waisted so many food boi
big man ting how is he not dead
I hope this dude is OK
Love ya man, but why did you quit doing Coney Island?
Losing your mojo old stonie would of pissed that
Glad you that coke is diet .. don't want too many calories from that drink
God level eater 💙
Sooner or later this is going to. Catch up to you
why are there so many dislikes
The vid is over already🥲
Bro have you ever had your blood checked diabetes bro😮
Alguém marca o Cobucci pra ver se ele topa esse desafio!
The best thing about this is that the one unskippable ad I had for this video was for a Yakult
Hey Matt Stonie, you’re not doing Nathan’s hot dog eating contest no more?!
Would love to see you do a chicken wing or hotdog challenge, like have your own Nathan’s hot dog eating challenge in your house and invite the host lol.
The brick of dookie you finna release after this is finna be catastrophic 😮‍💨😂
What happened to the first pizza thingie?
\m/
What happened to the first cheese cover tho
A valiant effort Matt. Clearly better to eat that lot when warm.
Wonder how hungry the cameraman gets? 😂
u fell off fs😢
this is the most Superbowl food ive ever seen
He has resisted so many urges to throw up,wow.
Poutine pizza - looks good to me!
Patatoes were harmed in the making of this video
PLEASE!!!! Please explain how he stayed the same size and weight? With the amount of calories he's eating, he would have to work out for hours upon hours to burn it all off. I don't get it.
im seeing someone else living my dream😃
Goat
Why didn’t u do the Nathan’s hot dog contest this year?
Hey man, wanna go bandos?
Nice poutine 😂
"The first bite tastes like heaven, the second bite takes you there".
LOL I love it.  5 lbs of fries, 2 lbs of cheese,,,, 2 oz of pepperoni.
why cant he just enjoy it :(
Homie just got caught eating cold fries…
Why were you not at the hotdog eating contest
Why did he stop competing on July 4? I used to root for him against Joey Chestnut!
Just watching you do the pizza pour TWICE was awesome!
no shot he did it again because it kinda folded on top of it's self, what happened with the old tray?
Video starts at 4:23
Where is Matt at the hot dog eating contest today??
Matt such a nice guy. Leaving some for his dog
That’s so fucking gross, but I love your work
The way he made a whole other one 😭😭
I hope he knows a good cardiologist.
I guess this why you wassing in the hot dog contest
I make fun of the US for eating unhealthy things a lot but I'd absolutly devour this
MATT we need you back one final time at Nathans
And after this vid..🤮🤮🤮🤮
bro sry but temu is a scam frfr
The big question is , what did Matt do with that first pizza fries tray
Hey Matt how come you do not do the hot dog eating contest anymore?
seeing your pfp in 2023 is chef's kiss nostolgia
The tray is bigger then matt himself
Tzuyang can eat more than Stonie but not as fast
0:40 Bro's eyes are insanely beautiful
Do the grimace shake 😈
thanks for this video
i hope you ate the 1st tray
It is like watching epic mealtime
Great video bro ! Finish or not your videos are fun to watch 🎉
Bro why aren’t you in Coney Island anymore?
Needa see your medical records mate
62 cent headset mofos that must mean business
I got constipated watching this
Healthiest breakfast in America
Why are you not in the hot dog contest
Matt getting slow😢
Are you going to ever find your nuts again and compete in the Nathan’s Hotdog Contest?
I would eat that
Eating healthier all I can think of is all the sodium, cholesterol, and fat and wonder how it effects his body.
I want this now lol
Funny how my guy isnt obese despite the massive intake of Calories
The fact that you used straight tomato sauce 🤮
Past lives couldn't ever hold me down Lost love is sweeter when it's finally found I've got the strangest feeling This isn't our first time around Past lives couldn't ever come between us Some time the dreamers finally wake up Don't wake me I'm not dreaming Don't wake me I'm not dreaming All my past lives They've got nothing on me Golden eagle, you're the one and only flying high Through the cities in the sky I'll take you way back Countless centuries Don't you remember? That you were meant to be my Queen of Hearts Meant to be my love Through all of my lives I never thought I'd wait so long for you The timing is right The stars are aligned So save that heart for me Cause girl you know that you're my destiny Swear to the moon, the stars The sons, and the daughters Our love is deeper than the oceans of water Hey, I need you now I've waited oh so long yeah Baby love, I need you now I've waited oh so long Passing seasons Empty bottles of wine My ancient kingdom came crashing down without you Baby child, I'm lost without your love Diamond sparrow, my moonlight majesty You know I need you, come flying back to me Through all of my lives I never thought I'd wait so long for you The timing is right The stars are aligned So save that heart for me Cause girl you know that you're my destiny Swear to the moon, the stars The sons, and the daughters Our love is deeper than the oceans of water Save that heart for me And girl I'll give you everything you need Here's to our past lives Our mothers and fathers Our love is deeper than the oceans of water Hey I need you now I've waited oh so long yeah Baby love, I need you now I've waited oh so long Hey I need you now I've waited oh so long yeah Baby love, I need you now I've waited oh so long So save that heart for me Cause girl you know that you're my destiny Swear to the moon, the stars The sons, and the daughters Our love is deeper than the oceans of water Save that heart for me And girl I'll give you everything you need Here's to our past lives Our mothers and fathers Our love is deeper than the oceans of water Hey I need you now I've waited oh so long
Matt's literally promoting fake Airpods Max from a site that sells fake stuff. That's literally why they're 62 cents. They're cheap knockoff's......they probably sound like 62 cent headphones too.....
Why the hunts plain tomato sauce 🤮🤮🤮 that shit got no flavor bro just eating straight acidity, try marinara sauce or pizza sauce next time please that hurt watching you eat that nasty ass shit fr
thanks
my mom loves temu
Man, now I'm hungry
Hii Sir I'm From India..... Indian Food
Man that's heart attack cheese 🤢
Thank you for still posting this video! It also takes guts to accept defeat in a battle, and still keep going in the long run. I believe in you, Matt Stonie!! 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
I think Joel Hansen would beat this guy hands down
Aw HELLLLLL no. Bros sponsored by a scam site
Question. Does he throw this up after these challenges? How does his stomach have the capacity for this?
TEMU has been a scam website and I’m disappointed that you’re advertising it. They are under investigation for their practices and you’re condoning it. You don’t care about your fans if you chose to advertise for them
That boy gotta strong jaw game
"Pain is temporary pizza fries are forever"-Matt Stonie quote of the century
I wonder if he throws up all the food after 😂
This is just pizzas with extra steps💀💀💀
How the hell do these people stay thin!!!
😱😱😱🧐🧐🧐
Try the colossal shake in Vegas I think
i dont know who you are but i love the work youre doing to feed the poor so keep it up    Edit: hey nevermind
Those fries look old and stale as hell.... Where did you get them? They look awful.
With Temu, the prices are so low because you are buying products directly from the slave factories😊
Finally new vid🥰
But is temu actually legit tho
NOOOOO not temu they have converted him
That looks disgusting
Imagine if Matt didn’t turn on record
Yes its very eat to eat bro not easy to eat 5:07
Why u don’t getting fate
Probably should've stirred it in a bowl aside and pour from there, wouldn't have to do all those close ups
I want some of those fries really badly now. 😊
no link for leds?
I've watched you since 2017 (even became a fast food addict because of your greasy content for a short time), so let's face it, you grew old.
Old Matt>>>
What happened too the fries 💀💀💀
hopefully you ate the 1st fail
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
Man…. The old stonie would’ve killed this back in the day. Losing what made you what you are.
Imagine someone coming over and being like "nice pizza you g-" 0:50
25% done, eh... 10%. Half way done, eh... 25%. Definitely generous estimates.
Plain tomato sauce, no seasoning or simmering . .what a huge miss there
Great try tho
Cheesus Christ that's crazy
is this the guy that plays osrs
con we think about his poor toilet?
Could you do a changed with Vietnamese food?
I had already watched a couple hundred of mukbangs but I really don’t understand how these people eat a lot!! Like I want..
Look at him eat with a fork instead of his hands 😊
How is he so thin??!!! I'm getting fatter and fatter just by breathing. Life is unfair and it pisses me off 😂
Those fries were never ending
Insane, anybody else eat that would easily gain 10 lbs
needed some oregano on that tomato sauce tbh
Matt's heart: *Boy if you don't stop, I will*
And I quote "this is delicious and easy to eat".
People before chewing was invented
I thought the first pour looked fine.
i love how he scoops fries with his fork
The man, the myth, the legend: Matt Stonie!
My mans getting old
Is Teemoo a scam? I've read that the owner of the app hacks  your personal  information.
I feel so bad for his jaws.
W video
I can’t believe people still believe b this is real notice you never see him swallow the food , he puts it in his month then edits to the next clip before spotting it out.  For the contest he does sure they’re real but 90% of the videos he’s makes at are are FAKE.
thats more food than i have eaten in like 3 months
Opinions on the new forestry update? You can now use a 2h dragon/crystal/3rd age axe. Waiting to see you hunt for those GZ on the rangers.
Damn bro you good? You ain’t never quit

These videos just don’t hit the same no more

What is the life expectancy of competitive eaters? Lol
Ja foi melhor, ta muito Nutella hj em dia , os desafios antes eram mais insanos, sinto falta ☹️
You need a bigger spoon.
Imagine eating a guys whole one week bmi in 30 minutes ☠️
Temu looks like a fake website and i have heard from others that what they ordered isnt what they got.
U gonna blast the toilet 💥🔥

whoever greenlit the ad needs to be shutdown
TEMU doesn't deliver to my country
Früher Macher Heute LACHER👎
Please stop promoting temu. Your info is not safe, people have reported getting false charges after using temu. Their products are not inspected for safety like baby clothes with high amount of toxic materials and they are meant to lose money from offering unprofitable prices to destroy the western economy. So ask yourself, how can a company afford to lose millions of dollars, who is backing them?
Just eat we don care about ur money
Hand shredded cheese always melts better. The bagged stuff has anti caring powder on them.
https://youtu.be/0nS5LzyJdpY
4:24 he starts eating
Ok either he didn't eat for 3 days or he has some insane metabolism to keep him alive
NO BRO ITS 11.707 CALS I COUNTED IT
PepperStonie PizzaFries

"Pain is temporary...pizza fries are forever." Sounds like a T-shirt idea. Lol

I do the same when he cook it I don’t do the epic pour and taked 2 😂😂
Credit to his metabolism damn
glad he drank powerade zero sugar. deffinatly made a big difference to a healthy meal
Nice 👌 👌
This just ain't the same matt stonie that built this channel but I know you can't stay on top forever
Can you do seedweeds
Yummy yummy in your tummy
I really would like to see his blood test results the next day. I REALLY REALLY would!
As a lactose intolerant person... this was painful to watch :D
people on CUT rn be like😶💀
Just stupid
just me or does the code not work for anyone else either?
Losing your touch a bit man but its understandable cause you've been doing this for 10+ years now, there will be a point where it hits you
The way the toilet would get up walk out my house after eating all tht cheese😂😂😂😭
Dudes grabs a Diet Coke after eating like 4kg of fries 🤣
Matt can you try a one big lechon
This is an example of what a human body is capable of.
You should do a video where you VS a subscriber, I feel like I could’ve ate that in 20 minutes
Pain is temporary , PIZZA FRIES ARE FOREVER - MATT STONIE

PIZZA DAWGZ
Bro  forgot the crust💀
PIZZA HOT DAWGZ

This guy his build really different 👼🏻
Booo u didn’t finish. U waste your food why? Stop making another food please it is gross,u should be ashamed of yourself
Damn Matt’s been losing challenges lately
Not gonna shit right for a week.
The mad lad, I'm doing this at my house warming party
man works out for 18 hours a day
did you just throw out the first tray of fries...?
temu ad 💀
Temu is ran by Chinese hackers
Am I the only weirded out by the fact he ate with a fork?
Glad to see you back after destroying that spicy ramen bowl, I don't think we're gonna see a spicy food video for a long time after that one lol
You're nervous? But on the surface you look calm and ready!
4:07 for us people who hate sponsored shit 😶😅
This Temu shit is garbage but love content otherwise
damn you fell off
Please upload more ❤❤❤❤
Respect. That was a lot! This was really pushing it!
What was that rock song in the background when he started eating
I love ur vids bro but please tell me u didn’t waste the first tray
what a gut bomb my god
Would’ve been easier to buy frozen fries, bake them partly, then add the cheese and sauce on top and put it back in oven….
Take two? Where did the first stuff go? Hope to your camera peeps.
He better not have wasted the 1st attempt
Video got 777 k views on a 7 day. 7 energy was crazy yesterday
The old matt stonie woulda finshed it lol still like watching tho
Gawt damn he shovels down for the most part in 30mins~  what i could subsist off of for a day and some change
You are an absolute beast.
Good attempt Matt. I have a feeling Joel Hanson would slaughter this though.
I always thought Temu was fake, I guess I was wrong.
It's good to see sometimes matt not finsh it because it shows that he's really pushing himself in this challenges
Matt Stonie... man, whose content never disappoints whether total failure or completely destruction. Always content. From day one to today! Lmfao. I'm not sure how you haven't aged since you started, man
Yo Matt, you fell off bad. I know it is hard but get it together man.
Temu is the BIGGEST scam in the world rn
Bro got nerfed 💀
Bro turned to topper guild + nikocado avocado
That diet coke goes a long way that's all I'm gonna say
I'm just barely hearing pizza fries :o
the only thing wrong with the video is the temu sponsorship
“Something got to me, I don’t know what” - Mr. Stonie. Um, it was the first ten pounds of fries and five pounds of cheese Matt. That was a lot!!
I hope somebody gonna eat the fail attempt pizza fries because to me wasting delicious awesome looking food makes me depressed 😢
my ears as you scrape fork against the metal tray though 🙃
I love pizza fries
my blood pressure has skyrocketed 😂
Im gonna throw up just looking at it
*PLEASE* try the 72oz *Big Texan Steak Meal challenge*! It is located at the Big Texan Steakhouse in Amarillo, TX. The challenge is you must finish a 4.5lb steak, salad, bread, shrimp, baked potato, and some beans in one hour. I would *LOVEEE* to see that!!   Please Matt
when was the last time Matt did a 'food challenge' and finished it? Wtf
Wait so what happened to the the first one did u just throw it away 😕
WOW you make a lousy 8 minute video per month. I guess when you get that many subscribers you can slack off and SELL OUT . EVERYONE SHOULD UNSUBSCRIBE and show these entitled YouTubers that you need to work for your viewers. Sell out
Wake n bite..... Challenge him😂😂😂😂
Idk if im trippin but attempt 1 looked more appetizing
Bluds doctor is insanely mad
That looks absolutely so good

good luck tomorrow Matt
“Something got to me guys I don’t know what”   After eating 10,000 calories of pure grease and acid.    Take care of yourself, man.  Brush after vomiting please.
Bruh ain’t no way he sponsored by that trash company temu
Temu? So he's cool with just scamming his viewers? Man I know prices in the bay are high but have some integrity
The temu curse
0:44 Dogs were questioning Matt's entire life decisions 😂
Big respect for you bro you did it more than 10.000 calories 🎉
it shouldn't have been a speed challenge. with volume like this it can't possibly be a speed challenge. it wouldve been better to attempt to finish all regardless of time limit.
@beardmeetsfood #beardmeetsfood needs to try this
No seasoning 😭
I would have used pizza sauce, straight tomato sauce would have been nasty lol
dude U DIDNT HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN
How bout making a good pizza besides pepperoni. Really nothing to see here
Should have just used hands
I can’t escape temu ads
When will you colab with BeardMeatsFood?
The 100 dollar coupon does not work
He finally did it…          Eat with a fork.
Never shows you the toilet he’s sitting on. 😂😂😂😂
Matt take that chain off before your neck turns green😂 thanks for the upload, Champ😎😎🤙
No ranch?
That looks so freakin delicious🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
GRIMACE SHAKE CHALLENGE MATT STONIE PLS

"pain is temporary, pizza fries are forever" -matt stonie 2023
Stone does the best challenges I swear
Huge props to Stonie. If I was eating massive portions of food as a job I feel like I’d hate eating just about everything in day to day life.
I guessed that you would fail like the other previous challenges. today you have become weaker than before.
you are a beast🤟
where the kilos at? id like to know
He’s human after all.
@jameswebb
how the mighty have fallen
I can be a real challenge for you, I can eat 10 chocolate donuts in 2 minutes 😮😮😮😮
POV: you're wondering where the first set of pizza fries went
Does he smoke weed before every video?😂
Beard would destroy you head to head .
spróbuj z polska cebula rekord to jedna cebula na 10 sekund
Can someone help me figure a channel name out. It’s a group of guys who make huge stupid foods. The main guy had a beard and always had monologue like intros hyping the food up.
King pizza fries
I always wondered why he used Powerade. Like what’s so significant abt it?
Matt just curious what do your doctors say about these videos? I’m no one to judge I am way more unhealthy on a regular basic just curious
Waste of food did u even eat the take 1
"Pain is temporary, pizza fries are forever."     - Matt Stonie
You should make another eating channel called "Stonie Reviews" where you don't eat fast, but you go into restaurants and review their food like a food critic. I would watch it alongside with this content.
Those potatoes got em lol.  Good effort tho.
He eat more calories at once than me in my entire life
Will the real Matt Stonie please stand up……… bro what’s happening to you.  Looks like too many sponsor ads and not enough practicing. I think your better days are behind you brother🙈🙈🙈
W Video :)
Why arent you doing the nathans contest???
4 minutes in and he already ate my year's worth of food
add salt and pepper to the sauce at least :D
The second you slow down the fries hit you like a rock I’ve been there my guy. 😂 Don’t eat half as much but I’ve had it happen in very small portions.
I would love to see an x ray of Matt Stonies' stomach after he does these massive food challenges
a chance that we get "more regular" videos? so at least 1x a month? or has that other reasons I missed why rather so "random" after time X times a video only appears?
"Pain is temporary, pizza fries are forever." - Matt Stonie
Has been
His shits must be huge
Temu? Why would you use a China data collection platform like that?
Matt’s washed 😂
I love that idea!
Welcome back Matt! We need more of your content bro
Everyone here wondering "what happened to the first one"
Are you competing in the hot dog eating contest tomorrow?
Still dont get why two times ....
Code doesn't work ya liar
Wish he still competed in the hot dog eating contest
Bro how do you shit after all that cheese?
I HATE WHEN HE QUIT. he used to eat it All up back in the days
Doggy wanted to help
that was a nice dish but temu says code is invalid
Looks so yummy!
Mad respect for Matt's plumber. Putting in the work
tough 1
bros out here eating 10's of thousands of calories and im here struggling to finish my bowl of soup
What im curious is how much does it cost😭
Hi matt your biggest fan I love your eating competitions please sent me heart
Dying channel
nice job wasting all that food dude
Make a KFC video
How does he not gain weight but others do ?
Tomorrow is the Nathan’s contest. Are you excited to see your rival Joey Chestnut take on a whole new crop of challengers?
And just regular ass tomato sauce. Lol.
Yes f***ing sir ❤🦾
How do you even train for this ??? Very talented
These movies are boring now. Not worth watching..
You need to get back to hot dog eating contest
what did he do with the first tray?…
He’s gonna need dialysis when he gets old me no more eating for him
Sure man exercises every single hour
Temu all Chinese BS. Free the sweat shop slaves
Never thought I'll see the day the man stonie quit a food challenge. Tbh that looked hard to do. Better luck next time bro 😎👌🏽
Mfer took 2 years off his life lol
Bro my hand would be tired halfway picking up all those french fries
Can u please get a “zero water” filter seeing u drink out the sink is killing me lol
you fell off + eric better
RIP toilet
What was wrong with the first one
Temu is actually a scam and is under investigation by the US goverment
Damn I just ate my hot pocket but this making me hungry
I love it 😍
Gross :D
temu is trash, ever heard of wish? thats exactly what it is but worse
Isn't temu FAKE? 💀
Why did you accept the Temu sponsor Matt I trusted you
Dam y’all was valid till y’all took dat brand deal from temu, now even stonie a scammer sellin out
He is getting old 😢
you've gotten soft 😂
isn't temu being investigated by the US government or something
Where’s tray #1?
NOOOOO not mat sponsoring temu😭
Are you in the hot dog eating contest tomorrow?
STONIE BACK WITH THE CHALLENGES... LETS GOO
Temu is literally Wish's version of Wish. No thanks lol
I saw your first loose for 5-6 years that I have been watching you. I'm scared, you're getting old
Bro that's very slow
Word of advice. Shredded cheese melts just as poorly as sliced 🤣
Me: I wanna lose weight Also me: ffff, I want to devour this ._.
I blame Temu , for this loss
im hungry bro
The juice going down pipe messed him up
I'd eat that hoe  real good mf pizza and fries it'll be gone by 10 min starved for a days worth
So what happens to the other one
Sad to see our hero is getting old.
even matt’s getting pulled into the Temu scam
6:53 it would take me that much finish that
I'd count that as a Win that second batch of fries had quite a bit more than the first, good ol Five Guys.
u ate enough when u can barely open your eyes
put the gloves on and throw the fork :D
You got this
Eating in 10 min what i eat in one day
Can't believe MS is getting married 🎉
So then the entire other tray wqs trashed?  What a waste.
I just gained 10lbs just by looking at him eat
😳😳😳😳 HE NOT FINISHED😳😳😳😳😳😳
I was watching this waiting for my pizza to be delivered. And I'm getting full watching you eat all that stuff.😋
Over time, mans will evolve and learn hibernation.
That looks good
Maybe you should have started off with a smaller amount of fries and half the cheese / sauce. Seems as if other competitive eaters are maximizing their capacities to exceed 20lbs and going faster these days.
He should have put a variate of fries from each fast food like McDonald’s, jack in the box, Burger King, and more
I know you all are wondering what he did with the first batch. He mailed it to me...
And Beard Meets Food had the audacity to say Matt isn't a fast eater 🙄 what a clown 🤡
WHY R U SUPPORTING TEMU? THAT COMPANY IS LITTERALY UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE GOVERMENT
I notice that you typically only make one video a month but what I’m wondering is how often do you have to do this to be able to do it once a month? Or do you just push your limits the one time ?
I watch your videos to get hungry 😂😂😂😂😂
I loved this video for one reason only and that is because he couldn't finish it and was man enough to face the camera and say it. Still a great job of trying. Much Respect to you Matt.
This looks delicious
“Pain is temporary, but pizza fries are forever” -Matt Stonie 2023
matt stonie you should eat a whole lechon
Wish you were competing in the hot dog contest tomorrow I wanna see that belt in the rightful owner waist again
:)
all i know is that if I ate any of that not only would i be in the bathroom because i'm lactose and tolerant, but my heartburn would be through the roof. so, props to you matt lmaoo
hi PRIME MATT STONIE
We miss you matt stonie
selling out to Temu huh? lmao
Big people hate how much you can eat and still look healthy lol
Temu a rip off?  https://youtu.be/20_TlrrB3W4
So close!!! I know you'll conquer it next time!
You gotta claim the bottomless cake record at Jack & Beyond in London, Battersea High Street! 90 minutes to eat as many slices of cake as possible.
Temu ? Really Bro ? Are you this shill for Chinese money ? XD
Ive always wondered, whats your diet consist of in terms of gut health?
Them Freddie’s Fries lol
this vid feels like death any% speedrun xD
He is staying thin
Growing up I always loved your videos and wishes I could try them... Now my stomach hurts watching you eat the food rip
no matt... Temu? I am severly disappointed. You just prove that you are a sellout
It's more of a  Poutine Pizza, for real.
When you're trying to go on a diet, and YouTube recommends you this💀
Ngl, I would absolutely eat those. ✨
I love how in these videos you don’t hear no club edm trash. It’s metal 🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼
One week food 🍕🍟 for a normal man 😨!!!! I hope just that your 🐶 is always alive bro 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yo..its like pizza fries
God that looks fucking abominable
Did I miss it, or did you not add any seasoning at all?  It could’ve been sooooo much better.
I have a challenge for you how about eating while keeping your mouth shut
I never thought you would stoop so far as to promoting a brand like TEMU... this is a new low for you.
Skipped 2 ads and a survey just to immediately get hit with 2 more ads that I couldn’t skip. YouTube is shit
Totally not watching this while drunk lmao
Try eating with your hands next time. You'll get it done faster. Remember the discovery of Master Po. You're welcome.
Age is catching up buddy maybe it's your bodies way of telling you it can't handle these  kind of massive portions
So... What did you do with the first tray you deemed "didn't look good" ? What a waste of food, smh😒
Hey Matt , I was thinking of a video idea? What if you attempt to break a world record in food eating , and use that as a charity event? 'Cus I eman you already have 16Million subscribers , and you can't lie , it would be sick to have a Guiness world record plaque hanging on your kitchen <3
😮😮😮😮
DELICIOUS
you are retired
temu is such a scam
Strange he took the Temu deal, looks like such a scam, thought better of Stonie icl
There is no way that I could do this. Not just because I’m Lactose Intolerant but seriously. Matt Stonie is a Legend❤❤❤
Yoo
mmm how delicious
It's OK!!! Sometimes you have to Man Up, TAP OUT, and take the "L".
Who else watches his videos when your hungry
Do a challenge where you eat till you feel full  Unless if you don't 💀
How are you not fat
It’s been 84 years....
"Pain is temporary... Pizza Fries are Forever"
Nothing as satisfying as Stonie devouring something huge & cheesy
YOU SHOULD TRY A RESTURAUNT CHALLENGE
I would be sent to the hospital if I ate that much cheese
However many views this video gets, it will never be as high as the sodium consumed
Twice is crazy
After 1 month finally
We’re those 5 guys fries?
Its must be hard being Matt Stonie's dog 🐕
Irrelevant haters will say that you're eating above your weight class😂😂😂
Name - *MATT STONIE* Job - *BLACK HOLE*
Plain tomato sauce isn't pizza sauce.  You need seasoning.
Five guys fries are so good but, damn, they are so over salted. Plus all that salty ass cheese and pepperoni? Jesus that’s probably like a month of sodium
Haven't seen you while king
Pgl😂
why did he make it twice?
😁👍👍👍👍👍
👏🥰💪🏻😍
Noooo  He being sponsored by a shitty company that sells off brand items
after one day toilet go brrrrrrrrrrrrr
I feel like I could compete with Matt stonie just don’t have the funds to go out and buy shit lmao 🤣🤣 I got a vid of me eating q burrito in like 45 sec 4 years ago maybe now I can eat it in 40
Damn that looked delicious. I'd be able to eat at least 5%.
You four friends arranged a small party and you see Matt Stonie coming towards you .😐😐😐😐
I hope the first tray didn’t go to waste…also, this would definitely send me to the toilet and a cardiologist…
1:27 WDYM TAKE TWO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FOOD
Beardmeatsfood’s worst nightmare 😂
imagine his gf's got a feeding kínk
Nice keep posting please
Matt stonie isn’t the same anymore😢
“Something got to me. I don’t know what…”  Might’ve had something to do with 10000 calories 😆
Where goes the failed pizza fries?
Larry Wheels gotta do this bro
In nz that’s probably like $60 -$80 of cheese on each tray easy. So basically $120 - $160 of just cheese 🤯
kyles jealous
This guy is capable of eating the earth
isat this temu thing just wish?
"Y una coca light porque estoy a dieta"
Fianlly old and gold content is bacckk❤❤🎉🎉🎉
hawwwwwwww khane ki barbaadi
TEMU? Really? Matt you’re better than that. For anyone seeing this, don’t shop there unless you want the absolute worst quality knock-off stuff.
"Pain is temporary, Pizza fries are forever"  Words to live by.
That tomato sauce probably tasted like water
How you gonna let Erik the electric show you up? Sadge bro
Matt you do know what happened you don't fk around with potato or even get cocky with it it's heavy and will kick ur ass😂
Pure evil 😅
Always amazing matte
Pls tell me u did something useful with take one😭
Stonie loosing his power to eat 😢
where i can buy pizza fries
What did you do with the previous batch of fries
code on temu doesn't work broooo
I just wanna know ... Even nikocado keep eating this or not ?
Living in San Jose and eating like a slob
W
i personally thought that he was gonna use his hands and scoop them into his mouth
Awesome attempt!! You were so close! 👏
Damals war er iwi schneller beim essen und hat auch mehr geschaft , naja man wird nicht jünger
bro jus comes back like we aint notice
‘This is too easy’ then struggles instantly after 😂😂
.. he had every right to tap out. He's literally eating a bag of potatoes. That looks like 5lbs of potatoes and another 5lbs of cheese.
It doesn't matter that you win or lose it
i know five guys when i see it
Can you imagine how bad you gotta feel knowing you ate 95% of that tray and couldn’t stomach the last 5%? That’s tough
You almost finish it, maybe because of those fries.
I always enjoy the latter parts of your videos but it seems like your channel is going downhill in terms of just brain rot in the first half. I don't even wanna be mean, just think you need some honest criticism.
are you really getting spondored by scammers? i mean its like aliexpress you just look at reviews and see but i seen reviews most packages don't come so like???
Life you gotta eat the goodies
2nd time asking plz do a eat off against beard meets food it would be legendary
The amount aside, Pizza Fries sound like an amazing idea.
Joey Chestnut could finish it off 😂😂
Its always the fry challenges that prove to be most difficult 😢, maybe next time. KEEP IT UP MATT, YOU GOT THIS
انت تدمر صحتك فعلا 🙂
He didn’t upload for months but now he’s uploading again.
It Looks so delicious!!!!! It is a pity not finishing the goal.
When is Matt going to just making the conversion to a fulltime osrs content creator? 😂❤
Bros loosing his ability to eat 💀
Hesssssssss baaaaaaaaack!!!
fuck sake temu is everywhere
Yeah Temu is garbage the products is even more cheaply made than what is in Dollar tree. Don't recommend spending money because you will be greatly disappointed.
😱
I think i can eat that in like 1 day.
Wow should have finished. Loser.
I died inside watching this lol. (Wait, I’m already dead inside. Guess my *inside* is just a skeleton now.)
How are you not fat? I gain weight with just a couple hundred calorries over.
Where can I find choco pan?
People think this stuff is real ?
If there’s a zombie outbreak I’ll make sure he’s number 1 mf to stay away from
Old Matt was gonna finish this in 15 min, asking for dessert 🍨
Question to Matt's gf: Does he fart a lot after this challenge?
TEMU gives me Wish vibes lolollll but this looked delicious 😎
good pour
Matt stone got old as fuck
temu💀💀☠☠
bro Temu is a scam
Lmao tf why did he redo it? It was gonna end up in a pile mess anyways the second eh started eating it lmao n he coulds just grab it with 2 forks n stretched across the fries if he really wanted to
I just ate too
I hope they didn’t waste the first bath they made ….
Needed more pepperoni smh
Well,in the immortal words of master Yoda of Star Wars and he quoted"This is why you failed unquote!!! In other words you got greedy and f*** up and that's that!!!😂🤣😂🤣😂
bro is a beast….. he eats all of this junk and is still in shape. WTF type of diet are you on
Damn Stoney getting old 🥲🤣🤣
Pouring it from the narrow side with cheeses is the best way control the pour. Much love from a person in the kitchen. Love the videos!
Crazy
Matt is a damn tank.
the first one was fine lol
yea ur washed
Why doesn't Matt do actual food challenges anymore? It's literally just let's cook a lot of food at home for the thumbnail bait and attempt to eat while not even finishing. This is just lame. I rather watch BeardMeatsFood.
I searched Matt yesterday to see if he posted or not !! Please make more videos!!
he has slowed down a bit not the matt stonie we once saw obliterate food challenges in his younger years
Maybe ill get famous off this comment 🤷‍♂️
What was wrong with the first batch?
What'd up w all the temu sponsors?
What did bro do with the first attempt
Imagine the VOMIT that came after this 😅
Who thought "Why didn't you share?"
Goddamn Matt, I don’t know how the hell you do it but you’re a champion
That app is getting investigated at feds ??
What did you do to the others
Not temu :(
Matt is back after 2 weeks heres your crown king👑
Gogo mat
I feel like Matt is getting old I feel like prime Matt would’ve crushed this
Hey Matt I don't know if you will see this but drinking diet coke is bad for you or anyone as it contains Aspartame which causes cancer. Not just Matt but for everyone who is reading this stop your friends, family from drinking diet coke.
you know its bad when he starts promoting temu lmaooo
Matt's face at 7:34 CRACKS me up 😭 bro is fed up lmao
You have to be some sort of Alien Matt, how do you still look the same a decade later after eating all of these foods sir
Why not pizza sauce ???
You’re still eating more than all of us Matt🙏🏽
bro I ain't gonna hold you, but you may be past your prime
Guessing you won’t be competing on Tuesday???
All because of u Matt, I had to make my own pizza fries for dinner today. I was suspicious how it'd taste, but it was delicious so thanks for that 😭😭 now lemme watch this video 😌
Dude so washed now 😂😂😂
I wish you would endorse reputable sponsors and not these scambait websites.
Listening to the fork scraping against the pan, was like nails on a chalkboard. I couldn't take it.
What did you do with the first tray?
Insane amount of sodium
He’s gonna be lactose intolerant after this 😂
How has this man not had a heart attack
Was just watching last years Nathans Hot Dog Eating contest rerun today and was wondering about you. And you grace us with another upload! But I gotta ask. When are you gonna step up and dethrone Joey Chestnut? Or is he just too out of your league for you to try anymore?
honestly i respect the grind, temu must've gave you hella to advertise their scam shit lmfaoo
Yea potatos fill u up fast in general full of carbs and too much u get bored od them 😂 the cheese and peperoni helped def but i dont see it helpin much
TEMU MORE LIKE SCAMU
Awesome matt, I could tell your addicted to fries.
Pizza fries is temporary, pain is forever
Those fork scrapes on the metal tray got me 🥴
Happy to see you back
What a waste of food
is it just me or has time taken a toll on Matt and no I don't mean him like being able to complete this challenge but he has not done anything like this in a LONG time hope for the best I am a fan forever -Yash
Temu sponsor? Temu I'd trust less than Wish and that's saying something
I just wanna know if someone ate the first pan…cause if not 😠
Dude he edited the good pour out. He didn't show it complete.
Just don't Temu fahkingdamn
At last, you finally upload😭
'Pain is Temporary, Pizza Pries are Forever '                                       -Matt Stonie
TEMU IS A STATE OWNED CCP COMPANY.  DON’T FUCKING USE THE APP.
STOP BEING SPONSORED BY STATE OWNED CCP COMPANIES, MATT.
“pain is temporary, pizza fries are forever.” *-Matt Stonie 2023*
Love Matt and his videos but seems like he only comes back around once a month for a check. Miss the old grind man
Pain is temporary, pizza fries are forever!
Every time this man does one of these challenges, I’d hold my breath and feel my heart about to burst. 😰
The first try looked better I'm js lol
Lets get a quick prayer for matts toilet
I swear if you wasted those fries just cause your stupid shot was bad
Matt cant finish it? then no one can
Do a 10lb of broccoli and cheese challenge
you cant watch matt when ur hungry i always eat before i watch his videos
nooooooo not temu
you should do a massive five guy's challenge
Yes, new video! Epic
Lets just say to never even try this with a forth of what he had
Dude….I shit bigger than you and can’t do anything close to that!! Good stuff!
Awesome as ever, dude!!!
Proud to say I’ve been watching Stonie for 8 years. I miss the classic videos of him prepping the big challenges. This was good stuff!!
Not temu Matt come on
I'm always watching to you Matt Stonie you're my Multivitamins to motivate myself to eat more foods ❤❤❤
pronounced tEH mu, also that shit dont work bro, not even gunna try it💀😭
“You can get this-“ *Skips ahead*
Tell me why i went to go grab my pizza when he got the plate ready he was already half way done and 7 minutes into the challenge
Is Matt losing his edge???
After all this time you finally do another challenge and you taped out? WTF?  But good to see a new video again. 👍
Old school stonie content right here. Miss the days before his channel skyrocketed. The Michael Phelps diet challenge was the first I’d ever watched.
this looks like a delicious heart attack XD
That’s why I couldn’t find any cheese at the store
The Temu Coupon doesn't work 😢 I TRIED STONIE100 and Stonie100
No don’t ever order cheap shit from that website that’s bad advice Matt it’s a scam do t you know that shit is a scam your credit card and bank account will be hacked good luck 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'm trying to gain weight and watching this really helps during my lunch. Makes it a lot easier to easy my big bowl of chicken and pasta
How far he’s fallen
Lookin like Matt is rusty! Need to keep up with the challenges!
Just remember people if you’re not paying for it someone else is.
Tenu is a scam.
But when is Matt gonna eat the Jack in the Box Snoop Munchie Meal?
I bet your dog loves those challenges!  Gotta pay the cheese tax!
Stonie is out of form.
And probably 1 million mg's of sodium🤯😲😱
I just thought of this food idea. It may actually be a challenge, but how about taking on grape nut cereal? Little bit harder than the sugary ones I think. Would be interesting to see how much you could get down. Love the videos Matt.
bro i wanna finish watching but that scraping of the fork on the tray... ughhh
so why again u wasted the first one?
I'm gonna eat the thumbnail. it is DRIPPING with EVERYTHING
W Matt ❤❤❤❤
Bro we need more Matt stonie! Don’t be afraid to redo old challenges
I want to see you & Leah “ the shuts” take on a big challenge
Finally hes BACK 🎉🎉!!
FAIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOL
*_TEMU  IS THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY SNOOPING ON ALL YOUR PHONE CONTACTS,_*  *_YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND LOG IN INFO... DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS SPAMMY SNOOPING SPYWARE_*
Next time you have to shred your own low moister cheese....pre shredded cheese contain anti caking ingredients, and what not... I want you to get that epic pour...So shred that cheese, melt with whatever milk, beer, water, then add some sodium citrate  😎🍻🤘
Pizza od shiet haha
Is it just me or is Matt getting ,, out of shape" with fast eating?
You should do a honey bun challenge
Shit you’ve gone down hill
Dude has to throw up all this food ain't know way it just stays there
5 guys fries ? 🤢
He actually tried one on “MyJaneBrains” ohio recipes 💀💀
So fun to watch!
Finish or not, that' my BOY!! :):)
I'm hungry now.
JL Jupiter intro in the Temu add though.
Not the temu sponsorship
You forgot the tradition of you showing us how you got  all of the ingredients
Pepto-Bismol!
I love that it takes a couple months to make a video because of his stomach after eating so much cant image the toilet and how he stays fit
What happened to take 1?
the fork noise triggered me
"Use Don Pepina" pizza sauce no tomato sauce Mr. Stonie👍
There should be a Matt, Matt, and Matt collab. Matthew Stonie, Matthew Patrick (MatPat), and Matthew Judge (DarkViperAU).
Beard Meets Food would have finished it!  Matt... need to step up your game for 16.3M followers.  Haven't seen you finish a challenge in some time...
Where do you put it all?
Bro ur a sav my guy 🙏🏼👌🏼🔥🔥🔥 I knoe u can do that it was tha wrong pipe fiasco bt u got it fam 👌🏼🔥🔥🔥🫡
Unbelievable, Matt!
TEMU GOT STONIEEE
EPIC MEAL TIME!
These weird concoctions are quite frankly getting boring. Change it up and go do some actual Food Challenges 🥱
I would love to try this sometime
good performance in the hot dog contest today matt! win or lose we all still love your channel.
i love it when matt posts
Stonie, is your capacity shrinking? 😜
That .......m.m.m.. .m
As always, Mr toilet is the mvp after the aftermath. Golden Seat Champ!
He gonna forever go down in history for making the biggest foods and eating it
Holy smokes dude
thought the first one looked good
He's shit now. Never finishes anything. Beard Meets Food is miles better.
scoops toppings into a pile. "id say im 25-30% done" Love your videos!!
damn man, that shit looks so good.
Temu is literally Aliexpress no?
It's crazy that you don't finish your own challenges. Feels like it's just to pop in to make sponsors happy.
Nickacovo avocado
Century Egg challenge when Matt?
Who ate the first tray?
What happened to the first tray? Girlfriend and doggo eatin' good?
TEMU is a scam.
Code doesn't work and I use temu all the time😢
I saw you on tv and you got 4th on a hot dog  eating contest was this live or prerecorde
I love how this guy eats like godzilla and stay fit at the same time
shoutout to matt's organs
I don’t know why they thought that the pour was bad it was satisfying
I could not even eat the leftovers
Honestly I don't think I can accomplish that for a free 1 million dollars .
The Mt. Rushmore of eaters is 1. Joel 2. Beard 3. Santel 4. Stonie 5. Chestnut
When I saw that mountain of fries I knew this was going to be a struggle. But hey the pour was good
Omg pizza fries sound sooo good
ur technique for with the fork was way better you were much faster
Definitely need some more contenttt!!!
Do practice for some of these events(meals)?
Matt Stonie l want you to do  the spicyest noodles in LA again but with Mei and race her and see who can finish it the fastest
I’m missed the old Matt Stonie, this is made about the fckn money
He got that wish version of wish sponsor
Hello bacchoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
You've gotten old and slow
Pain is temporary pizza fries is forever -Matt stonie
Looks tasty 😋
Looks like 5 guys fries.
But I cannot order from Bangladesh in temu.
Five Guys fries are the absolute best. ❤
goddamn !
No way did you throw away all that food from the first attempt
This guy just casually put 10 Pounds of pure carbs in one sitting :D
I really thought he was going to lose it all at the end😮😮😮😮😮😮
you overcooked the cheese matt!
jak nie umierasz
The number of people who have never heard of pizza fries is astounding
Big fan ❤❤
This is the most American thing I’ve ever seen   🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
how does this guy keep his sodium levels down this is insane...any tips bro?
I miss the meal challenges, do an all-American meal like you did British and Italian
-pain is temporary, pizza fries are forever Wise words of Matt stonie
Kinda fucked up to waste that much food just because it didn't look good, while the 2nd time around didnt look any different... Also that sponsor is questionable. Junk products for extremely cheap, consume, consume, consume... fell off..
att 2?
Temus just like wish shitty products u sell out by the way nice fail
Bruh don’t partner with Temu again. They sell the shittiest scam products you can imagine
Мля, как в него это влезло...
man this channel has gone downhill
Bro has to have the most dense muscles in the world after the kinda shit he eats and how much he exercises to stay in shape
I can’t believe you’re supporting TEMU…
Bro not temu...💀
Nxt time do a food challenge wit hot pockets let’s see how fast u can finish a box of hot pockets anyone ur pick of choosing
wtf was that temu thing?!!
Bro was having a stroke and was going into cardiac arrest at the same time
Not hating but what happend to the food in the first take
Okay so here i have challenge for u, probably u never ate things like that but try to make POLISH FOOD CHALLENGE where u have to eat (Pierogi / kotlet schabowy / Gołąbki / bigos)  Good luck have fun mate
Dammmmn bro that was impressive! I’m honestly surprised you got so far, and I’m equally surprised that you tapped out that was a monstrous portion of potatoes my man
You can do a whole workweek on that amount of food almost
Sometimes in life all you need is a massive tray of cholosterol and a diet coke to wash it down
Bro finally uploaded
where have matt been ?
This channel has become a mere shadow of it's former glory. I hope to resubscribe again some day
Am I the only one watching this on a diet?
Do an authentic taco challenge  i  like it
That pizza fries looks absolutely delicious ❤🍕😋🍟❤
I knew he can't finish that. All that cheese immediately gives you a stomachache, don't you think
Stonie just needs to hang it up at this point.
Amazing 🤩 amazing 🥲 amazing 💪💪💪
how do you fail at the very end like that? like 6 bites left or so
wow matt temu is the biggest scam site out there right now =(
matt pls stop eating too much food ur gonna have a heart attack 😭😭😭
disappointed that he teamed up with TEMU, other than that good video
For sure he’s barfing it all afterwards… No if ands or buts. There is no way in hell he’s that skinny eating all that food.
That was disgusting
Matt is getting older it seems
Hey you should do something for Garfield's belated birthday and do a big tray of lasagna now that would be cool
what was wrong with the first one?
Sponsored by TEMU? ... Bro, you better research who you are getting in bed with. TEMU can destroy your brand and your personal integrity.
Big L
James webb could beat him
matt really buying into this chinese spyware app lmao
finally this mf came back
Temu 🤦‍♂️ That stuff is nothing but junk for degenerate consoomers
4:01 Everything reminds me of her
You should try to do it again cuz you can do better
I wold eat with my hands if I were u
2nd challenge matt gas ever failed😔
Bro it’s like u fail nearly every challenge now ur so bad idk if it’s pride with money or subs or what. 😂😂😂
damn ,i haven't watched Stonie in a minute.
I don't like the direction your content is going. Too edited for my taste, quarter of the video was an ad, and quickly changing camera angles often. Video didn't rub me right.
Anyone else, besides me wanna go try this for themselves now? Cause this looks freaking delicious. 😂🍕🍟😋
The thing is I don't blame you at all for quitting it's way better to stop before he hurts himself
Nah Matt u got OLD...!!!
Not a quitter.... the food in the wrong pipe threw you off ❤😊
Can you do feat. lukedidthat?
God he's getting old. 💔
Absolutely mega delicious so yum
that looks awful lmao. im so impressed
You are not matt stonie after the 10M 🤨
I want long videos i am now lack of matt stonie videos
he just cant do it anymore but that was still entertaining
You Are The Monster of Calories...
MATT STONIE IS BACK AT IT AGIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4:20  You're welcome
Love the face after the second pour! That camera cut right before it tells me it’s more possibly a reaction from some remaining tomato sauce falling onto the floor 😆😂😆😆😆
I want to see Matt Stonie vs a dog in a eating challenge
Please don’t tell me you tossed the first attempt because it wasn’t aesthetic
Amazing!! 🤩🤩👍
Jesus how…You GOOD?!😱
seems like age is catchy up to matt. Never seen him struggle this much
Slipping a little bit I see
Bros just not the same
Props on the Temu coupon bundle mention! I scored some good shit on there, my wife and I usually find 9 times out of 10 awesome goods and threads that last quite longer than most of the stuff I find in stores, aside from that, you got me craving pizza fries now!
Next challenge: eat a loaf of bread, no water or drinks
Think it was using the fork that threw you off abit… should of just went all hands in & handballed it like you usually do to the clear the entire tray😏 awesomee 2nd attempt like always🤘🏻🍕🍟
You should do the cheezit crackers challenge. See how many you can eat
Wow shilling out to a Chinese company that’s obviously a huge bait and switch scam? I’m out. You used to be cool man.
Your pets probably hate that you never share lmao
Tell me you didn't throw away the first tray.
Krass was du essen kannst das würde ich nie schaffen Respekt
The fries look damn ugly 🤢
Matt again crazy! 🍕🧀⚠
Why isn’t Matt competing at Nathan’s anymore
if you use vegan cheese and meat you canna finished it amen!
everything's free amen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! cha ching! freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! amen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Honestly matt i feel like the food challenge thing is getting kinda old. Maybye not for your subscribers but for you. I mean eating large amounts of unhealthy food, it must get to you sometimes doesent it? All im is maybye a change for the better could be made. Just a tought.
do you wanna know something cool? everything's free amen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! link in the description:)
the cheese plop was pretty entertaining hahaha. the fries look good at least amen! veganize it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! amen! GESARA!
You go Matt. You still got guts. You still got more eating machine powers. Someday, Raina Huang would love to see you
this boy is silly ha! it can't be healthy to eat that much cow products. what about if you veganize it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! amen! GESARA!
Almost did it buddy
Matt Stonie getting closer to retirement more than ever! lol. 💯
THE LEGEND IS BACK!
Welcome back😊
you are really good at eating but your were better before but still good
The fact he isn't diabetic the day after all of the gargantuan amount of food he's eaten, is insane 😶
You're sponsoring a Chinese company that sells Chinese knock-offs? *smh*
bro killer idea! you almost had it!
I respect you Matt, but sponsoring this video by TEMU (a company that is currently being investigated by the U.S. government) was a L.
But you could’ve pulled it off on the 1st attempt
Damn that’s about 7,000$ worth of fries from five guys 😂😂😂😂
Was just checking out if you have a new upload. And I was not disappointed! ☺️
Time to retire bud
You’re not a hero bro, you’re killing yourself! Take what you have and settle down with it. Heath is most important!
idk about temu.. seems kinda fishy and idk why
temu bro😭😭that’s bad
Bro ate enough calories for 2 to 3 days in 1 sitting 😂 that’s wsup bro
Man poopy himself
I’m drooling, you’re suffering and I’m craving
Five guys?
Fuck man. Missed you bruhhh!!! Keep waiting week after week for a new video : (
Awesome
bro said temu is similar to amazon lmfao. You mean wish
I mean I'm a perfectionist but I would've stuck with the first tray and said it was good enough lol props to Matt for making it look better on a second attempt
RainA eats that for breakfast.
I bet The Very Hungry Caterpillar can eat that whole thing.
Geoff Esper puts you to shame now
Hey, i really appreciate you man, like really But not Temu... don't support those crappy and massive drop shipping asian industries...  I'm almost begging you to remove this ad, but that's only up to you...
Do not Pizza. I'm Italiano 😭😭😭😭
MEGA-TOAD
I was cheering Matt on to get under 20 and then 30 minutes but still I AM AMAZED THAT HE ACTUALLY TOOK THIS AND USED IT FOR A FOOD CHALLENGE. Nice job Matt
That look absoloutly disgusting. I would puke and cry if I ate that.
You didn't need to scrap the 1st tray.
I've used Temu so many times I'm not gonna lie I don't get how things can be this cheap and actually of quality but everytime I get what I ordered I'm amazed at the price for what I get.
This channel is losing it hasn't been good in a couple years
This guy's kidney is machine 💀
It's been 84 years...
Matt Stonie really uploaded 44hrs into my 12 day water fast 😢
What happened to the old Stonie where he used to finish challenges?!
Are you competing in the hot dog eating contest?
You say potato I say tomato
Nuvvu Inka bratike unnava
İ came to see if you have gain weight..and ur still in ur small body..i wish for that body plus ur metabolism system 😢
That 2nd pour was epic!
5:43 "Pain is temporary. Pizza fries are forever 😤 - Matt Stonie 2023
When are we getting the Epic Meal Time redo? We’ve been waiting forever. And imo, this was not the best food pour. It’s in the top 3 tho
Stonie is outta practice, it seems.
This would’ve been an easy challenge for you back then….
Why not pizza sauce instead of just plan tomatoe sauce?
You’re a legend mate
woah
Get revenge on the KFC full menu challenge
Why is TEMU so cheap???? I feel like I’d be supporting a sweat shop ! 😵😵😵😵😵😵😵🙏
That must have been annoying. I get sick of them during one order's worth. They're good while I'm eating the burger.
You doing the hot dog contest??
Can you show us your poop?
Ay you gotta chill
good thing he mixed in a diet coke so he didn’t ingest too many calories
i saw bonk. is tht bonk XD
Yet another failure of a food challenge that matt from 5 years ago would have crushed. Bro has lost his title
❤
a challenge incomplete?!
OMG 😱
Big respect Stonie, as always 🫡
Awesome job Matt.
"Something got to me"   Yeah you finally got full! Potato challenges though are always hardest.
That was the best food pour yet
I hate that I can't eat stuff like this anymore.  Blood pressure was out of control.  And I'm a skinny boy.
The amount he had left at his tap out is tmmy limit. I'm saying the amount he had left by the way, not the amount he ate.
It's a good day when Matt posts a new food challenge video! 🍕🍟🙌🏼
Dude glad to see you back I’ve been watching beard meets food and Joel Hanson but I am always going to come back here when you upload bud
YES!!! Looks good
wow u have gotten slow
Temu is literally a scam wtf. You have to buy like 6 other products to get one for free… so the stuff is NOT free… there’s stipulations. Stop spreading fake news. Dislike
a big no for me EWWWW
Temu’s prices are so low because they use slave labor in Asia.  Surprised you are allowing them as your sponsor…
The cheese is so melted but he got five guys fries to put on the bottom I really love how he’s ready for these challenges as always
I wanna see ANYONE beat what you just did!  That was IMPRESSIVE!!
,,We've had some epic Food Porn in this Channel"
Molly Schuyler puts this dude to shame. He's a poor excuse for a competitive eater. How he has subscribers is beyond me. He never even completes challenges.  Just the truth.
Crazy how he doesn’t gain weight
oooooooh. Temu = bad news.
no seasoning in that sauce thats the real challenge
Can you do a reveal video of your poop schedule ?
This looks gross 😅 but good effort
There can’t be any room for organs lol
Fucking Temu Code doesn’t work bruh
Is Matt not competing in this year's hotdog eating championship?
Respect to the trY of pizza fries for taking this fight on short notice put up a good fight maybe with more time couldve done better but we all know Stonie wouldve won no matter
Type 1000 diabetes😂😂😂😂
Babe wake up matt stonie just uploaded 🥵🥵🥵
I would've plowed through that tray of pizza fries in a heartbeat. Pizza and French fries are both favorite foods of mine, and combining them would just complete my life. Then again, I'm a big guy, so the last thing you'd expect is me eating a food combo. But, I'm also on a diet, so... Yeah, wouldn't be eating it.  Also, huge props to your girl for staying with you while you're plowing through food like crazy as a world record holder. I don't know how Meilyn tolerates it.
I like how the dog doesn't jump on the counter and eat his fries..
That was a sad waterfall 😂
POST MORE
There something that feels wrong about watching this and eating breakfast
Ik his toilet be struggling after he does these videos😭
#diabetesforlife
Thank you for not faking your videos ❤️
I've honestly never heard of pizza fries before, but looks great!
Damn. Matt’s slowing down. 😂😂
lmfao while im glad you're getting the bag, i'd be careful with temu, literally the only genuine reviews of the site have been it's a scam and not even worth the 50 cents they charge you for whatever item you're looking for
Didn’t Temu’s parent company get in trouble for selling customers personal information
This would be pretty good without the sauce  Also kinda fucked to do a temu  sponsorship
the puking after this one in order to preserve asshole integrity and basic health parameters must have been like sending your throat right to the ukrainian frontline
Rip homies 🚽😂
Always a great day when you upload. Hope you have a great day Stonie
see u in a few months bro!
Wow
No he didn't not just waste all of that food when the pizza didn't pour on right. What the fuck man
I’m watching your hot dog eating comp at Nathan’s and wanted to say good job
You can tell Matt isn't practicing much with his skills, he's definitely lost the touch. I'd doubt he's even competing in the hot dog challenge this July 4th. We've heard the "the next one I won't quit" line like 4 or 5 challenges in a row lol. No shame, I'm just saying why keep torturing yourself you know? On a side note, the idea of this actually sounds and looks pretty tasty. I'm gonna have to try this one. On a much smaller scale of course haha.
Yea.. Finally he is back 🎉❤
Reality SON GOKU
What is soduim
Monster
MATT?  i just have to ask.. are you going to do the 4th of july "hotdog eating compition" this year. ?
Why not just make it like a normal person and bake the soggy gross five guys fries with the sauce and cheese and pepperoni like it's an actual pizza?
KICK IT`S PEPERONIE ASS MATT !!!!
No whey Temu got to Matt Stone 💀
I don’t know where he puts it.
So close. Man ate 4 days worth of food in 40 minutes
My butthole while watching this…
is it a pizza-tine or a pout-zza
Boss: You have half an hour to lunch  Matt: Pizza pour fries😊
Cold 🍕= 🗑️ bro.
Boy wts your cholesterol level..
I was wondering how's Matt doing and typed your name on YouTube and then saw a video uploaded just a few hours ago!  Unbelievable
He’s come so far from his old videos with just one camera, shitty yellow lighting, and his brother’s egregious but amusing laughs 😂 Matt’s never changed, though. Love you man
I know you dont care but i give you the win on that one. Everything getting cold killed it for ya
American snack
No way bro accepted a temu sponsorship
bad look sponsoring temu
Yessssss been waiting for a matt video! This was epic ☺
Pizza......fries?!?!?! Instant 👍🏼 😁
“Pain is temporary, Pizza Fries are forever!” - Matthew Megatoad Stonie
Fk this shit,almont finish then you stop eating???lol
Nooooo why are you scamming with Timu. Cheap knockoffs 🤦 out this company back in the hole it crawled out of.
bro garfield been hittin that meth pipe too damn much
Wow
Bruh temu sounds like they make products thatll randomly blow your head off
Isnt temu a scam????
Babe, I've been following for years now. Next time; calculate the amount of KC's. You've never done 10k+. Not needed though, you're great as you are.
Bro really got Temu to sponsor his vid.
Watching this while on the toilet dealing with the morning after a lactose intolerant kinda night and it’s only worse now thanks Matt 💩
Bro I would have to have not eaten for a whole week to eat all of this xd
Mad props regardless
Carne Asada fries are forever. I'm not sure about pizza fries.
Man this is disgusting lol could feed an entire family for a day
Never thought I’d see anyone sponsor temu 🫢
How the hell are you still in shape?
old skool challenges >>>
My horror is knowing you did this twice. My question is did you eat that first one too or did you throw it away. I hope neither
be careful matt, temu has been in controversy for using like slaves for their products recently
Stonie be slippin’ 😳
KALO SAMBIL MINUM NANTI GAMPANG KENYANG DAN MUNTAH ASTAGA WKWK
KALO SAMBIL MINUM NANTI GAMPANG KENYANG DAN MUNTAH ASTAGA WKWK
At this point Matt is just thinking of the most unholy yet delicious looking foods, plowing through them, and still isn’t Nikado
My question is, what happened to the failed tray of pizza fries?
This app not for india
Oh, sh. You're advertizing that scam site. Good for you. Make that Scam money.
And here I am with my plain old crinkle fries and some chicken wings… Aye Matt!!! Ill take the ugly tray, let me at em! 😂🔥🔥🔥
The amount of damage you are doing to your body is crazy.  Our poisoned food supply is bad enough in small quantities.
This is insane
Bro think he Matt Stonie  💀
Nice cold chips, I bet they taste awful. edit: Temu has been reported for scamming, poor sponsor on your part.
What is the blue water he drinking?
matt always slaysss🤌
You should’ve done fries from different food spots.  I bet you would’ve finished it all 🍟🍟🍟
I still think that it’s amazing how you can do that after so long of not uploading
Matt Stonie is a shell of his former self
2:34 Garfield.. is that you?
This is fucking insane Matt
Every video he posts feels rushed, and all he does is share sponsors. I miss the old way he did YouTube.
So we all just gonna act like we didn't see the cut at 4:02 while pouring
7:52 NOOO YOU MUST FINISHHH
Why did he use Five Guys fries again? I thought he said he was going to use Frozen fries since they aren't as salty.
🤢🤮😂 that's Gross
i wish there was a vlogging channel
The eater is back!!
Always a good day when Matt posts
Who else loves when Matt makes his own concoctions? Reminds me of his older videos 😌
*I'm about to offend alot of people* I don't like pizza BUT these look delicious but that might just be because I'm almost 9m pregnant & most food looks good to me now😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤I love your videos btw😊
Your content has really gone downhill.
please lets not normalize advertising child slavery by accepting temu sponsorships?
wy wouldnt you season that sauce, dawg? gross.
Looks good as heck, I  wanna do this challenge
TEMU is the new Wish. Stay away from it.
Bro, that is INSANE how much you can eat. Love it!!
It makes me sad to see this legends downfall
first one was way better
Even though your upload schedule has slowed down, I still watch every upload. You're just one of those channels you can never unsubscribe from!
"Matt, man you gotta chew your food"
Getting old 😂🔥🔥🔥
What number do you think his plumber is on speed dial?
you are very good man no wonder you are the best in the world in terms of insane challenges like this me thinking that nothing else could come more profane comes a challenge like this kkkkkkk very good indeed saw success stonie ❤
Incredible 😶
Yo Matt, how come you don't do MLE events anymore? Haven't seen you on Nathan's in awhile.
Temu didn’t believe my address was real, despite having sent me stuff before…to the same damn address
You fought until the end brother, you need to revisit this in the future and demolish it! If it wasn't for that water issue you would have won. Love your videos
It’s nice that Matt is back
Y didn’t you just put the fries on the bottom 😂 and heat up everything
guys gotten weaker
im so confused how matt stays fit
"Pain is temporary pizza fires are forever " --- Matt Stonie
Will you be in the hot dog contest
Do the Kevin’s famous chili challenge
i feel bad for your toilet dude
actually eating, not selling you something or wasting food begins at 4:25
L
Was that a muscles glasses reference
“Pain is temporary, pizza fries are forever” Well fucking said
never thought a fake aliexpress would pay youtubers to advertise
The only thing that really bothers me about this is the cheddar cheese. Cheddar has no business on a pizza, let alone mixed with mozzarella. I am genuinely disgusted by that combination, and not the fries. It’s almost as egregious as St. Louis pizza using provel. Barf
Mashed potatoes with Gravy is actually a British combination though we have it with Pork Sausages as a staple meal.
Can you make a Challenge with grimace shake?
Italian poutine
I see you that you are losing the level every video and you eat less the good one
GOAT of youtube food eatin challenges
nah bro really did it again after the first attempt Legend
PIZZA FRIES?!??!?!? WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Damn does one video every three months and fails that’s bad 😢
You’re the man Stonie 😎.  Come on my dude. I want you to start winning some of these.
Holy shit
The sound of the fork scraping against the sheet tray was making my skin crawl.
Thank you, Matt, I miss this type of food challenge.
“Something got to me..idk what” maybe 10k calories of grease?
You are crazy😂
just so you know the sponsor of your video is a shit scam website that sells garbage to ignorant people.
If u collab with the capitalist devil… such as Temu… then u actually have no soul
That is not the right sauce but still looks good.
Matt you did a great job on devouring what you could of that massive amount of fries and cheese. Not many would have been able to consume that amount.
I'm sure this is one of bayashi's dishes
Matt is an living legend
NOOOOO MATT YOU JUST DUG YOURSELF INTO A HOLE BECAUSE TEMU SPONSORED YOU
A rare video
Isn't temu a scam?
I made one of these probably 1/10 the size because it looked really good, I threw it up like 4 hours later because my body couldn’t digest it. This mans built different.
what happened to the first attempt? and did the you go back to the same dudes who sold the fries? i imagine they were thinking you were hosting a party or something
I just hope that he didn't waste the first pile tho.
Nikocado avocado first oppenent
JOB FAILED!!!!!!!!!!!
Beard meats food would destroy this
old Matt never taps out :(
EPIC pour!
Sorry but ur choice of sponsor is poor at best if ur gonna promote 💩at least play it safe and go for raycon or raid temu is basically wish but funded heavily by ccp dont become 1 of them youtubes that try to promote how great the ccp r and the world has it wrong about how chines people have to suffer coz of them
Great seeing another Matt Stonie video! 😎👍🎉🍕🍟
The king has returned
:)
Matt: Are you doing the Nathans hot dog eating contest?
Your amazing bro😮😮😮
Awesome stuff! When do we get to see Stonie at Nathan's to reclaim his mustard belt again?
It was a satisfying pour tho 👍🏾
He quit after all that, Matt not the same beast anymore
Round one pizza fell like a bedsheet in the wind lol
We need a collab with Beard Meets Food asap!!! Seems like he’s been taking the game by storm. I know he’s older and more seasoned than you but the inconsistent uploads make me feel like you’re growing out of this profession. I could be wrong!!!
What the fuck happened to the first batch of pizza fries
Cheese meltdown was glorious to watch. Superbowl and July 4th food ideas
Ok that ad is not OK, selling Knockoffs. Redo it with a normal item and dont scam your viewers. PLEASE have some respect. Temu on its own is fine but advertising it with apple Fakes, is wrong and you should feel ashamed for it.
I haven't eat that much cheese and fries my whole life!! Respect Mat 💪
Do you take massive shits also?
When he told the dog "There's not gonna be any leftovers for you NO matter WHAT, and I DON'T CARE"... I lost it.. LOL
Can someone clarify if the Temu thing ain’t a scam
Hopefully none of the fries went to waste, including the first tray that was made. That's some delicious drunk food right there!
Well for attempt one you had a good taste test
Come one bro don’t advertise Temu when the app is known to hack peoples information
can you do largest loaded fries challenge next please
Uploading at 3am EST is literally the worst time 😂
can u please attempt to eat the 4 times spicy buldak noodles
damn i'm hungry
Video #60 of requesting a chocolate chip challenge
Very Big Pizza Is 11,706 Calories
What did you do with attempt 1? What a waste
I wonder how your heart is still able to function. Jesus christ !
Are you gonna be there in the 4th?
That was like a blanket of cheese
Our boy has became fancy he’s using a fork
Mad respect Stonie❤
Wondering what happened to the first attempt
a month for a 6 minute video and i ain’t complaining one bit
Bro Took Half the video to Start the challenge
Yay I am so glad and proud to see you back Matt stonie I have been a fan since 2018
Probably all that acid man. Tomato sauce is very acidic! I use tomato sauce as a cheap way to trip rust off or leave an acid burn finish. Pretty neat. But ya, that much I, I only imagine what it’s doing to your insides after 20min
a Matt Stonie upload = a happy Sunday :)
Heart attack speedrun
The amount of food food matt can eat is so freaking wild.
I stay thin by just watching this man eat.
He legit did the whole thing over again lmaooo😂💀hope he didn’t waste the other one Maybe the camera person ate it lol
Diablo
Matt farming his shorts channel with minimal effort for maximum profit and ignores his main thing is the saddest
Matt has the kinda energy that you just can’t hate. He seems like a fucking goofball to hangout with.
Headphones are 9 dollars not  .62 cents.  Just saying
Really hope thats not the aspartame poison coke
Lol he gave up, Stonie is washed I guess
I'd so love to consume this excellent foodstuff once in a while. When I do *I will* end up with mouth ulcers, acne and/or headaches... 😂
Starts eating 50% through the video
That was a little hard to watch. But you pushed past farther then I thought you would stop. Truly amazing. And it's ok for the channel to see you have limits from time to time.
lol you didn't finish
He finnally uploaded after 1 month
I love this guy❤
i was jokingJOKES i got dared
The old Matt would have it beat this! He’s completed 20,000 + calories before and insane stuff ike the Michael P challenge
This gotta be the best junkies food combo  Yum
If I weren't poor I could eat that tray of fries😢
Pizza Fries are so mouth-watering.
long time no upload,where have been bro???are you sick???
I am amazed how this guy doesn't OD on sodium any time he does these challenges.
Damn that sound was something
I unsubscribed from your channel for endorsing established tiles. You still haven't edited or taken that popeyes video down
This guy is crazy, you can't eat in a hurry. Because the stomach cannot absorb all that amount of food quickly and for this reason, you become fat.
Let's Play Runescape!
Wonderful
Erik should try this. I think he can do that.
The third time's the charm, Matt! I see you coming back and knocking it in under 15 minutes.
Matt stonie, Those are my two fav food and you made something incredible! :)
That's looks amazing. Were those five guys fries?
Man he's getting old. A couple years back he could eat twice the amount of food and not burp once. Now he cant handle a single tray of carbs.
the thing is tho.......thats not cheese my friend.
Looks so delicious meanwhile i couldn't eat a quarter of this😂😊😊😊😍🤘
Do like 5lbs of boiled eggs.
How is he not morbidly obese
After eating that entire first tray off camera it's crazy how well he did on the 2nd tray.
You know its serious when Matt Stonie is praying with his oven gloves on 😂
More like a Pizza Fry platter to me!
Matt is getting old and weak HE CAMT FINISH CHALLENGES EEEEEH 😀
Nice attempt on too much food
bro però non c'è nulla di una pizza 💀💀
There hasn’t been 1 video matt made where I didn’t enjoy it. He never disappoints keep up the awesome content 👏🏽🔥
The old Stoney would have used his hands
Man dude has gotten weak if he could not finish this.  Molly, Dan, Joel and so many others would have destroyed it.
I am sure you will get the w next time
Temu be scammin
The biggest awe factor of all videos is that he drinks tap water
your gone soft in your old age!
Fail didn't finish
Doesnt feel like the original matt stonie who used to complete way bigger food challenges. :(
I remember in the past Matt mentioned that anything potato related sits heavy in your stomach. Despite the struggle you almost did it Matt.
i think the dog was concerned for yuh matt😂 cute doggo
He ought to be able to walk on water with amount of salt running through his system.
skip 1:35-2:57
*How the hell this guy's body refuse to get FAT ?*
LETS GO STONIE!
0:44 what da dogs doinn??
😮👌
Gigachad Matt is gone 😢
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 awesome 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
🤙
This was actually a bad video… between the sponsor with temu (being investigated / causing over 1 billion dollars worth of information leaked from consumers), to you being out of prime / maintenance to do an 11k calorie challenge. I expect a “sorry I haven’t uploaded” video soon for the 20th time but honestly I’m not interested anymore
Matt is quite the eating machine 😊
ive had temu for a few months and didnt get antrhing because i thought it was scam
the dogs: this bastard never leaves any food
Nah miss me with temu
Shame
Finally something normal from you.
His shits have to be just as legendary. What goes in, must come out.
Wow that’s makes me have a heart attack watching even looking at it from the beginning.. (respect man ..) you just are a legend eating that.
Lolo pizza fries,, delirious😅😂🥰🥰🥰👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
He ate with a spoon and fork Surprise how he did not just ate like savage with his hands
5:07 what the hell does "Eat to eat" mean 😂
Thats so much cheese. I'd be sh*tting for days That pour was epic tho bro
that food just makes me starve
whoo huge. NIce try bro.
You got it champ 👍
In my head, I was thinking, that’s a lot of sodium…his body probably can’t handle that. From the sauce, to the fries, to the hydration drink…all sodium. This was crazy! Thanks Matt lok
Should have tried with McD's fries ! Easier to swallow !
you need spoon to eat faster
Wow, that was a struggle.
I thought he made pizza 😂
Dude. Attempt #2? Did u just throw out like 7lbs of perfectly good food because the pizza shit didn't fall perfectly? Ya. Uh. Don't fuckin do that shit again or I'll unsub.
2014 Matt would’ve demolished this no problems in 20 mins tops…
WWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWW!!!!
My Mouth is Watering when you Eat some😓
I'm glad he's back to his food challenge
Why waste the first one smh? Could’ve just moved the cheese over
Didn't temu get caught scamming or something like that
‘Plenty of time to go’  But there’s no time limit
A real man would have ate both trays
NOW THIS IS WHAT I CALL A RETURN! Am I right?
I've been waiting for you bring back the "old-school" food challenges you did a few years back. This is awesome!
When did he start this tik tok editing good god it’s awful
This man's toilets deserve respect
Good effort bro. Rye flavor fatigue was killer on this challenge
That food is bigger than my body lmaoo and so much cheese 🤧 yeah i’m glad you quit haha  I was eating a hamburger last night and the amount of cheese on it nearly made me vomit after forcing myself to finish the entire burger before bed.  I can imagine that must feel like a brick in your stomach-
Day I lost count of asking Mat to eat his gfs height on subways.
I hope the leftovers went to the dog
To quote the words of Uncle Roger, "This the kind of the meal you can have only once, then you die of heart attack later"
the avergae american meal
Matt is back. Finally
Pizza fries look so good! 🍕🍟
too many fries, not enough pizza
I feel like hes slowing down... i mean he ate a lot but i feel he couldve done better
Epic Food Pour! Only critic is with the placement, temu is a chinese company which collects a ton of data from users such as your name, address, phone number, birthday, social media profiles etc. That's the biggest part of their marketing model, selling user information.
What happened to the first tray tho
Man that looks good
Wtf u make 2 trails and only eat a half u more like Matt Belonie to me
So u lied to you're dog, because there is something left 😂
Matt has a lot of heart.
Thats just disgusting. Also  a waste of ^food^ please do it vegan.
Thank God for a Matt Stone video. This should last me a couple of months.
I love pizza.🍕I love fries.🍟 Never did I think combining them together. Interesting.🤔
Bet he still ate the first batch that didn't pour as good as the second bath
🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕 nice
How you don't vlog no more I miss your actions 😊
Do you ever finish anymore?  These video's feel more like updates on your sponsers ads.
See you all maybe in another year. Maybe then Avatar 3 will be be out (2024).
I miss your mini cooking show before eating Theres this chinese fat dude that always cook his food before eating. He has millions of views on average 😂 If its just take out chellenge i dont watch yer video anymore
Matt Doctors living luxurious 💅
I would love to try that concoction myself but I don’t have the money to afford to buy the supplies
Sold out to Temu LMFAO.
i can already feel the Italians struggle to watch this video
He literally failed the last 10 challenges lol
Just watching this video is giving me diarrhea.
I would find it interesting if you put yourself on a scale before and after eating. 😂 also with the water, which all comes with weight in the body
Why temu   We all know it’s a scummy site like wise   Why
Funny, but I've never seen Molly fail a challenge !!!
Pizza fries do sound pretty legit
HES BACK
Fake code
May I please just have a human size order of that. LOL.
Man's slowly killing himself for views. Even if you burn the calories, it's still unhealthy as fuck. Especially the ones that involve a bunch of sugar.
6:17 That's what she said
YESSSSSSS
Nice but unless Mathew gets sponsor he doesn’t upload video 😅
I love cheesy fries and this is a step up, i now want pizza fries
temu is like wish?
All that cheese started to turn solid in your guts. That’s what happened. 💩
Temu is a scam.. you get a thumbs down on vid for that.
is the promo code in temu available in any country?
👍👍👍👍
He protecc He attacc But most importantly, the master is bacc
Never heard it, so many rubbish sponsors out there😮
Here's a hats off to Matt's doctors.  Keepin the GUT workin'.  👍🍟💥💥💥😱
Bro brought new food for the thumbnail. Shows how great he is.
I think we can all agree,that Matt is not in his peak anymore
😮😮😮
Just realized how buff matt stonie is
You make enough on YouTube AD revenue, please stop doing these Cringe Ads bro……selling your soul
That looked painful 😬
Dayum that’s a lot of fries
Ja pierdole
Did he just waste that much food 😵‍💫
6:44 She's so sweet. 🥺❤️ My ass woulda been like: ARE YOU EVEN EATING ANYMORE OR JUST MOVING THEM FRIES AROUND THE PAN!? 😒 😂😂😂😂
He went from posting every week to posting once a month to posting every other month lol.
I wanna see Erik the Electric do this challenge in 30 min
See...the people who slip to the challenge will never know the code muahaha
i fucking love potatoes
Hi Matt! I really respect your hustle and I love your videos. This is why it makes me sad, that the sponsor of this video is a quite questionable. I wonder why you need to agree on a sponsor that has such poor reputation. 😞
Next time keep half warm in the oven? Whattaya think?
Bro ate everything in this known world 😅😅😅
iz gettin weak
Matt u should try a Tom Yum Koka Noodles challenge they r spicy noodles 🍜 (not sure what flavour they r) and u don’t have 2 do it if u don’t want 2 (because I forgot about that last spicy noodles Video u did and I forgot about it before)
My gastritis could NEVER! 😂
He’s definitely past his prime, unfortunately
من موندم این چرا چاق نمیشه
Mai Day🎉 Stonie You Crushed It😊 Really, the amount speaks volumes.    Legend
thats epic 😂
stonie is back
So what happened to the first attempt food that failed?
One of the rarest youtubers whose thumbnail is not a clickbait.......
blud promoting a fake chinese amazon💀💀💀
Let's goo!
Capital T in Twice, Matt are you a Once?!?!?
It's the pepperoni. The taste gets super weird after too much, and it also gets very salty. Quality effort though.
Matt, where do you put all that food? Because you ROCK😎🤙👍
This is definitely food porn
you can advertise Temu, just dont advertise knockoffs
matt where have you been
Yum 😊
Also, why does he time his videos anymore? No one is gonna try to beat any of his times on these videos lol
This one looked painful. I think the fries looked so thick. I wonder how this would taste with a mcdonalds type of fry?
gg
camt lie the first cheese and peperonis looked better
What a piece of shit, wasted all that food from the first batch just to get a better shot.
Stonie Bowls 4 tha WIN people!!!
Is that Morgan in the background!? I miss that dude!!
Mans is being sponsored by a website that is under investigation 😂
Please dont tell me the first load went in the bin
He’s as much of a chef as he is a world class eater
I tried the code and it told the code was invalid
Old school content 👍🏻
Soggy fried :(
im so glad he ain’t finish, not only was it getting kinda gross but i just felt bad for him eating all that it was getting bad
Matt I’d finally back 💪
I wonder how his doctor feels about him doing all these challenges
What's the blue color water thing he drinks?
Woah Mattt rarely takes n L.
Boys fallen off
Pizza and fries lmao
Does Temu deliver in Georgia? (The country
5:22am ; wanted to go to sleep. saw matt stonie posted 😕🙌
Man, feel like everyone surrounding Matt has to get trained to know the Heimlich. That's still super respectable how far you got and to make it look somewhat appetizing lol.
Bro you finally back 😂😂
Did you experience gerd in your eating journey? Bcs i experienced it recently and idk if i am healing or not
FORK!!! He is using fork!!! Not bare hand.
Nice to see u eating 😅
A fork!?  Who are you anymore?  You have to get your hands dirty!!
Looks so good
What was wrong w the first tray….? It looked great
Im gonna be honest, this food you made doesn't really look good or appealing but well done for almost finishing it all anyway.
Almost 12000 kcal but diet Coke 😂
The occasional failure is fine and serves to highlight the huge quantity of food he's consuming. Otherwise you could argue that he's not setting the bar high enough.
In 5 minutes bro already finished half the tray😂 it would take me a month to eat all that *competitively*
wait ive seen those bootleg Airpod Maxes before. they were in a DankPods video, they suck! why are you promoting garbage?
the old stonie is back!
So glad to see a post from you
It's a good thing you don't upload frequently, otherwise you'd probably be goner.
Bruh what is your upload schedule
French Fries are so dense. Your the best Matt.
Your code didn't work for me 🤷
Bro, bulking is easy for you matt you can eat alot i struggle to eat a lot, bro.
Matt Stonie Upload?? Must be a dream
Most of the food challenges seem to be getting to Matt as of late. I hope he can still compete at pro level. Would love to see him top the eating contests again if he goes to them anymore.
Yessss!!! Missed the old stonie challenges!! This was amazing! Keep it up!
As always, the fries remain the bane of Matt's existence.
What happened to the other fries?
Where did those fries come from?? 😍😍
molly woulda finished it
Valiant effort. Can't win them all
matt stonie fans be like finally another video
Why does the whole video look like a long trailer? Wanna see more BTS stuff. And this one looks like a just-to-upload-something-8-min-long video.
It looked cool, good pour, worth the effort :)
Bro is just flat out promoting open scams at this point. Watched him for like 8 years, still easy unsub
the first pizza looks delicous the second looks disgusting
Kinda disappointed you let yourself get sponsored by a scam site like temu
Puking TIIME!
How do you come up with this?
He's back..
I cackled when you said attempt 2 because of the pour 😂😭
this guy's poor toilet 💀
that looks delicous
Oh no he's beginning to not finish challenges. it's all downhill from here
Take 2? I hope you gave previous food to some homeless guys or something like that. I would be sad if you wasted that
Yes!! Another Stonie video!
This is literally my first time seeing Matt eating a junk of french fries while using a fork.
HOW???!!! You still skinny???????????
Props to him I don’t think I could come close to doing what he does. Maybe a few years ago but definitely not now.
Just wondering, what happened to the first attempt of the  cooking?
I would have quit long before you did.. You did a great job! A + BUDDY!
What have you done of the first meal ? Don't tell me je just throw it away
Thank God I have auto skip sponsorship segments
Yeah there's no way that's 11000 calories, more like 6000 or 7000 max.
long time no see🙂
A weeks worth of food 😅😅
Just watching this is making me fat.
Best line Sick and tired of fries
His kidneys :  boss I'm quittin' ( no salary !?! I've worked for like... )
Matt stonie been a legend in food
So is matt gonna compete at nathan’s 😭??
You know its a good day when matt uploads
Videos are way shorter now.
Temu is fucked don't buy from them. They never sent my order. >:[
w
Matt Stonie the king!!
You did great stonie even if you didn’t complete it fully, we still believe in you. Much love!!! 🎉🎉
yeah that very hot cheese drip drop is not good for speedrunning eating :(
Kevin samuels
you bought the 62 cent headphones and it breaks in under an hour💀💀💀💀💀💀
Temu’s a scam
2 of my favorite foods into one, I love it, I could try it someday to shared with my friends
The return of the king
1 hour ago and kinda early
The code is not working
Cold fries
拼多多
Amazing. Will you be at Nathan's?
Let’s take a moment of silence for his Toilet.
I looooooooooove your dog sooooooooooooooooo much
😆👌
Wonder what kind fries use
That tomato sauce needed some seasoning. Some oregano and garlic
You are getting old boy 😂
There is no fucking way! That's edited!
Only doing sponsored videos lately, getting kinda annoying.
RIP your cholesterol and clogged bowels after this
i mean we want content but you dont have to torture yourself
u srsly selling out with a china app?
I want this power : eat more stay fit 😩
Sponsored by Temu is crazzzy 💀💀
Stonie fell off fr 😂
Bet that can sauce tastes awful, choke it down Matt
694th
Did anyone think he was gonna finish in 10 minutes
Dissapointed in him to support temu tbh, does he know the allegations against them or what?
Do you have a temu rose toy code?
noooooooooooooooooo
Is Matt finally slowing down
He's getting too old for this 😂
Matt Stone:"Pain is temporary but pizza fries are forever",(2023).  Meanwhile, Matt Stonie's toilet: Why do I feel a disturbance in the universe?  Matt Stonie food challenges are always so epic to watch. 👊😎💖
Eskisi gibi değilsin
Jesus Christ
Have you ever done a challenge with poutine??
Give this man the munch munch fruit from one piece CAUSE GOD DAMN
This some regular show shit
You should use a laundry basin or a bucket in the future.
Temu🤣🤣🤣wth
What a noob. I could do this in 10 minutes easy
Everyone on YouTube is losing their pizzazz these days it seems
My boy lost his touch 😔
Pain is temporary Pizza fries forever. ~matt stonie
Have you been to THE BIG TEXAN STEAK HOUSE? I thought you had but I don't find a video. Have you been eating a huge amount of vindaloo? That would be fun to see.
sad is he do advertissing from a scammed trash company
Merece muito like 🇧🇷
It's beautiful 🥺
Not Temu😰
our boi getting old 😭
Making me hungry
Matt Stonie is a scammer!!!
I don’t understand why he had to make it twice. What was wrong with the first batch? In fact it looked better the first time. Cheese was more golden
The chipmunk is getting old. It's ok old man. If you cant take it just say so.
Man I love you videos❤🤤🤤
Never forget that Matt Stonie is the only eater to ever dethrone Joey Chestnut in the hot dog contest.
American poutine
He is getting old now…
Don't spend the material 😢
You just throw the first? Not cool
What a 😺! Joel would have finished that, no problem! & Beard would have asked for a dessert menu! 😂
That temu add is wild bro tf but I know he got a HUGE BAG
What did you do with the first batch??? What a waste smh. Imagine third world countries seeing this lol
Just straight up tomato sauce? No seasoning? Not even pizza sauce or marinara instead? Hmmm
Bro…….
good
it’s 3 in the morning…
Love from Pakistan 🇵🇰💞
bro you should try macdonald 🍟 with it
I always wonder if Matt has ever thrown up or felt sick from eating so much
Matt stonei is eating fod
Why would you use tomato sauce instead of pizza sauce?!? I'd peruse marinara but 🤷
I have to make this, an eighth of the size but 😅🤘🍕🍟
Wdym take 2 where did the first plate go?
Tf did he do to the first tray he messed up on?💀
I could've helped you finish that. It looks outstanding!!👑👍🏼
why u post this at 3am
Been watching Matt Stonie since 2012
Liver failure is temporary as well 😂
Stonie works with the government.. Anything to kill us!
He's actually alive.
Tanboy kun no 1
Nah temu sponsored you come on
Getting old lol😂
Matts toilet: Oh God! No!!
Why is there a giant loud fan in the back. So annoying
Famous last words: "I thought this was gonna take way longer"😂
12am post. I’m here for it!
He's getting too old for this it's starting to show big time unfortunately
0:45 dog be like "wot" o.O
Stonie is losing his edge.
BIG W FOR MATT STONIE FOR NOT CLICKBAITING US
What is that, like one less order of fries?  XD
Love Matt!!
Damn his toilet is definitely having a hard job 😂
Matt Stonie VS Tuna Tavus
Promoting a scam site. Hope you feel good about that.
You are the only craziest YouTuber ever to do this challenge
He puked it up at the cut off then ate more
Those fries looked disgusting tho
Nice
man I wish matt would upload more often
I'm so poor it's cool you eat a week of food in 10 mins.   Nice job?
Awesome idea, i would never want to ruin my stomach like that. Will always want more food nah such a waste
Lactose intolerant hell
I came
Great combo.!! Wouldve love to see stonie eat with hands on this one like beast mode!!! And use blow torch in between to heat and re caramelize the cheese!!! Either way got me wanting that!!!🎉
I would have weighed those fries.  They are wildly inaccurate at Five Guys and it is usually in the surplus.  They may have been over by more than the amount he failed by.
How does bro surpass the repetitive flavor it’s gotta be gross overtime 😭
Dude its 2:43 and im hungry ☠️
You tried man that’s all that matters👍🏻your the champion 👍🏻 doesn’t matter if you finished it or not that’s a lot good/calories. Epic man love your vids👍🏻
Great idea for a potluck, btw...or the same toppings over mac n' cheese. 😊
man is out of shape. no longer in the game. its likes seeing ur favorite action movie star get old and try to do more action films.
That sponsor is sussy af bro.
hi bro
i was early forgot to comment too busy cause i watched this banger
I feel like for food challenge ideas Matt will go to stoner parties and will take notes when the munchies hit
“Matt you missed the few fries on the dish.”
Sorry but this is pathetic compared to Eric the Electric. You can'd to quantity
Looked good both times… uhhhhh I’m sure both times is a different context for you
Matt's kids be like : Dad went to poop & never came back 😂
Love you Matt
Where you from dude
mans the only person in the world with a trash disposal blade in his toilet.
good thing he not lactose 😩😂😂😂
Bro casually advertising aliexpress clone that sells crappy fake products. Shame dude, lost some sympathy points there!
Good luck against the GOAT Tuesday. AKA Joey. 😈😈🤣🤣🤷🏾💯
Tomato sauce is a very strong sauce and shouldn’t not taken lightly
old Matt Stonie will doit
Yo #MATTISBACK EVERYBODY (Seriously welcome back matthew youre never gonna see this comment are you?)  Edit: please reply it would make my day!
He has to puke after these vids right?
Bro this is nastyyyy
Old school I like that
"Pain is temporary, pizza fries are forever" 😂💀

Ohh you bastard course you will upload when im already starving..
Maybe you just needed some ranch drizzled all over to help it slide down 😎
I hope someone ate that failed batch
2am upload, and I’m here for it. Notification squad!
2015 Matt is proud that 2023 Matt is trying to be what he was in the past and Im proud too ❤  Sadly we only get new vids if he has a sponsor 😞😞
Cant even eat a quarter of this, Matt is a legend bro
Hey man, you gave it your all! Nice work!!!
Ngl this looks good lmfao
You have to do a challenge with @s7s it will be amazing challenge
If it’s worth doing…it’s worth overdoing
Only a quarter of this video is an ad :( really think you could've done better in my opinion. You should just make the whole video a Temu commercial!
🤮 ong that don't even look good
"Hungry" In The Dictionary Has Now Been Changed To "Stonie" My Man Has Changed The World. 🌎 📖 🍕 🍟
that looks really good
Rip toilet
Hey Matt have you tried the Melt Bar and Grill  the grill cheese challenge?
How does this affect Lebron’s legacy?
🔥🔥🔥
Love the channel but shame on you for advertising for an app that spies on people/stores data of American consumers, bypasses security firewalls, thrives on predatory business practices and most likely using the app as a form of economical warfare.
The scraping of that fork hurt my teeth so bad 😭😫
Dominoes:👀
You know it’s a good day when Matt stonie uploads a video :)
Really, not in shape.  What is Joey Chestnut going to do to you in 2 days.  Ever think of that?
Temu is shite, shame on you for plugging that trash
I wonder how his blood work is like
Lvl 99 cooking in RuneScape but lvl 1 cooking irl
Uuuhh, I just had a foodgasm
Weird time to put out a video lol
MATT IS BACK JUST LIKE THAT 💯
Hes prob in the bathroom after this video is done
Temu trash boaa 😂😂😂
Wagwan my g
Temu looks hella sketchy
My belly would bust and or 🚽but you have a good time matt. Kudos
This is epic meal time but he actually eats all the food
Glad ur uploading bro but Man U worked ur stomach this time man, stay safe bro
Matt stone I love your videos and am a big fan but the 100$ thing doesn’t work it either fake or I’m doing it wrong either way I still love you!
Come oooon man
crazy vid So insane 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Bro....😶
Well it 👀🤤
This is absolutely something I will make for myself someday. Obviously with much less food 😅
Oh shit he finally posted lol. Bro used to post like crazy now its super rare
I’m watching this at 12AM hungry
Big respect to Mei for staying with Matt throughout watching him munch his way through the most unholy amounts of food
First time I don't see him eating fries one by one lol
Omg i thought this is an old video. It's odd to see a 22k views Matt video.  ඞ Leaving this bad boy here
Matt stonie Stomach is a Black Hole🌑⚫🕳️🕳️
Bro it’s 2 am
what did you do with the first thing of pizza fries?
Looks yummy
I mean ayy he did his best
When ever i need an idea of what i haven’t eatin yet, i go through matt’s videos.
Been awhile since we got a stonie food challenge. Always love them when they are out.
How is this guy's heart still beating?
Regain the thrown for most big Macs eaten
Sheeesh finally
half of the time with fry challenges with stuff it always ends up being a fry challenge so you should try to layer the stuff in with the frys like say with the chillie cheese one and it would have stopped the cheese on the side. and not hating love the vids
Another video another paid advertisement
Temu is a scam website don’t advertise that
nobody talkin about the temu ad? 💀💀
Stonie Finally posted a video! Genuinely love this channel man
Another mind blowing video finally
king is back
We think that we would eat a lot but we realize when we sit for eating
Ratios were way off, too many fries and not enough pepperoni.
Temu is as bad as shein, encourages waste product for cheap. Smh sell out.
Welcome back to the roots!
wonder how big a salad he can eat
I feel full just watching these vids 😂
How are you still alive💀
The man is running out of sponsors not TEMU 😭😭😭 NOT TEMUUUU 😭😭😭😭😭😭
The time between videos has become too long. The duration of the videos has become too short. The care put into the videos has decreased a lot. Failures have increased a lot. ->It's time to unsubscribe
Stonie pizza
He must have lvl 99 cooking
God bless glutony
Heart attack fears Matt Stonie
Not gonna lie, that made me get very hungry. That Pizza Fries looks absolutely Delicious!
🥶
Temu is down bad matt
❤️🙂❤️👏👍💪
Chat is this real
what did u do with the first batch? 💀
Why do you talk so much?
Bet his stomach gained 6 packs by now
Go asleep
bro whyd you bost this so late
8,000 calories of fries, 7,000 calories of cheese, pepperoni and tomato sauce, total calories, 11,706.
U cant tell me that doesnt look good on camera and good in real life!
2 much calories 4 me fam
Happy 4th of july everyone! This is as American as it gets!!!!! 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
What I watch when I’m starving in my bed at 2 am
that was too much bro u gotta chill fr
Where's dessert? There's always room right?
99 cooking irl
Welcome Back!
Matt, it might be time to give yourself a break. A longer break than you have given yourself. You have entertained us all for so long, I am sure I am not alone in thinking it is time to take care of you and to stop pushing yourself.
having long break can make ur goals down
Good luck with clogged blood vessels and cardiac arrest 😂😂
Bro temu is fake
7:16 I think he was about to puke it all out
Bro you not finnish this challenge i think 1 year you not eat pizza again😅
MATT IT'S 3AM GO TO SLEEP
AFTER A  LONG KING IS BACK👑👑👑👑
That was epic! 🤩
Happens if the breaks are too long u lose it, cheers ❤
Dang! it's 1 o'clock in the morning where I'm at. This is a really late upload!
Mouth watering
I remember him actually finishing his challenges. 🥸
watching him eat is still amazing, but ngl you can’t help but notice that he’s def out of his prime. I know that he’s probs busy with other things and hasn’t had time to practice much but it’s def noticeable now. no hate tho still goated
It gives me heartburn just watching this 😂
Matt Stonie Is A Legend In The Youtube Community.👏🏿💯💪🏿❤️
weird time to upload but i aint complaining..😂
That really does look delicious
Matt...it is 3:07 am
A lot of hungry unfortunate families could have used that first tray 😰😰
I haven’t watched the video,but I already know this is a Matt Stonie classic 🔥!!!
Do a collab with beardmeetsfood we wanna know who the real boss is
Tired of seeing Temu ads, it's literally Wish crap.
What did he do with the first tray that he messed up
Hell yeahhh brooo
The cut at 4:01😂😂😂
what happened to the last pizza fries? surely it won't go to the trash right?
YUM
Hi Matt Stonie I like your new video, could you do a video on a big ice cream challenge for next time please, that would be great.👍👍👍👍👍👍🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍟🍟🍟🍟
I miss you bro. Been watching since 2019
Five guys fries?
If you scale it down, this is just a cooking channel with extra steps
What happened to the rest of Attempt #1???
What happened to the first tray? You didn’t just throw it all out, right?
Pizza fries!
Let's the largest ramen lasagna challenge.
props to matt for giving up sometimes. sometimes u cant win them all and I respect that
random comment to help with the **ALGORITHMS** 7/2 hat
Glad to see a full challenge finally. That said he looks rusty. Old matt stonie would have eaten those fries in half that time.
But why do you have to use some of the crappiest ingredients? That tomato sauce has to taste like dogshit on this scale
Anyone else watch these vids while eating crummy snacks? Tonight's snack for me is dry ramen, eating em like chips right out of the bag.
Ok wtf why is this guy sponsored by temu. Everything on temu is fake stuff and scams u
Matt you were so close cant believe you quit! It may have taken you 5 more minutes but you should have finished! But what do I know I probably couldn't finish 25% of what you did. Glad to see a new video, take good care brother
Crazy
0:20 "I think you know where this is going 😏"   Yes, Stonie. *I know* 😏😏😏😏🍕
disappointed matt didnt finish it
washed arc 😔
Pizza fries!!! 😂😂😂😐😐😐😱😱😱😭😭😭💀💀💀
Anyone else immediately recognize the five guys fries? 😅
FIRST CGANG
You can tell it’s healthy because Matt has diet coke on his left
your stomach is not the same anymore =( Still alot but you would have downed that easily before.
Man this was amazing. I hope you are ok Matt, I don't no why it looks like this is one of the most difficult challenges you are done. By the stops I mean.

“Pain is temporary, pizza fries are forever” -Matt Stonie 2023

So know one else’s thinks about big his shits must be after this?!?
💯Excellent Video MS!  ‼️
How many minutes and what degree to put the tomato sauce, cheese, and pepperoni in oven for?
First
Мой перекус
man those fries looked amazing
I feel He’s not being able to eat as much as he used to in his prime
Great video :) don’t blame you for getting sick of the fries toward the end though cheese can be more filling the colder it gets!
Thank you mate for giving me content to watch when I am bored
its 2 AM right now
الحمدلله على نعمه الاسلام
finally new videoooooooooooooooo broooooooooo u need to post more often 😥😥 we miss your videos ❤❤
That looks delish 🍕🍟😊
😮so crazy and yummy
Great video definitely should've used better fries
So what happened to Wish ? Temu is the new wish ? Lol
Never thought I would see Matt post a video at 2 in the morning, but it’s probably earlier for him
Better luck next time Matt, stay strong 💪
Exercise? Thought you meant extra fries.
He took so long I almost unsubscribed
Its always a good day when Matt stonie uploads
Well...iam hungry as fuk now 😂😅
This video was very cheesy.
Honestly looks really yummy 😋
2 tubs of sause 2 bowls of cheese and 10 pepperoni. The ratio seems off lol still looked good 👍
A blessing that this man is still alive after so much, long live to stonie❤
2am banger!!!
Matt Stonie more like Matt Stone-will, the guy does everything he set his heart to.
Bro ate so much food his jawline had no choice but to grow
My stomach would pop!!! I'm always in disbelief how Matt does this!! 😂😂
Five guys fries are so good! They just get heavy later on!
TELL A FRIEND TO TELL A FRIEND.. HES BAAAACK!
E
"He's back!!!" Us:    🥳🤩😁 His 🚽:  😭💀
I really wanna see a post production of these videos what does he do how does he clean up a peak behind the curtain a lil bit
What happened to the first tray hope it wasn't wasted that shit look good 😂
Meh iz ight, id like to see him do chow meine. Its my favorite
You should do full in and out menu
David goggins: finally a worthy opponent 🤣
Now I have an entertaining video while I eat my meal lmao  Also satisfying moment when the melted pizza lands on the fries
How does he stay slim?
Like those who are starving right now
Knowing Matt I definitely expected him to use his hands for this one and just go ham
Not to be a karen but what did you do with take one, that was a lot of food
Bro use a large spoon!
Who wants Indian chicken biryani 1lb with garlic naan and chole bhature 😂 challenge
