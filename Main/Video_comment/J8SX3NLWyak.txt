Bro its almost 2026 and im still watching this✌️😭🥀💀
6:39 Rugby Tackle 😂
seeing oussi footy in a barca shirt is so typical ngl. Messi fan is a barca fan lol  (I am a madrid fan and a messi fan)
How did Camavinga not get a pen there? 10:20?
Bro seeing @ousiifotty in Barca jersey it hurts 😢
9:53 ter statue really tried getting fancy with the save
El día que todo culé no quiere acordarse
I come back to laugh at the fuckers who call him overrated. LMAO.
9:09 GOOOOOOLL
Send to me Somebody
10:23 how is that not a pen
Bring me back
7:24 When teams are so evenly matched, small details like missed penalties and given penalties matter. You gloss over this and give them a penalty in the away leg for something that's a fraction of this foul.
0:14 yo it’s oussi
9:07  WOW! That goal was a legendary moment for real madrid. Bellingham is one of my favorite players because of that goal.
Oussifooty in the 15 th second
THATS OUSSIFOOTY 0:13
That Gavi 🔥
ter Stegen October 28 against  Real Madrid
Bellingham barcas nightmare
12:09
I think Dortmund regress giving Bellingham some Madrid
s class game from both
bellingham is an amazing player but i did not expect him to carry the team to victory
Real Madrid winning ucl
Don’t support Madrid , but love Jude 🫡
I’m honestly getting irritated with Vinicius jr. bro is honestly a hall bagger. These matches should really be 5-2 same thing happened in the champions league we almost got eliminated from vinis stupid finishing problems. I prefer Brahim Diaz to play than that selfish idiot!
Always people overrating Bellingham and underrating Lucas
And they did it again 😂
He did it again today in the Beenabeau against Barcelona with the winning goal 3-2
Y aquí otra vez perdiendo gracias al arbitraje 😂
Cancelo at the front? Now I see why he’s been dissing CR7. Looking for a spot at the front 🤦🏽‍♂️🤣
3-2 saved us again 😅😅😅
Mandriles hpta siempre robando!.
Yrtiwtueh10kdhjzg🎉🎉🎉❤❤
Barcelona L Madrid the Best
Do you see this English Premier League? This is the standard of officiating. Why don’t you start by trying to produce a ref even a quarter as good as this one.
Wowowow
5 months ago already!!!
People who saw a prime water bottle right next to Tony kroos when Bellingham score the first goal
Bellingham is crazy good bro
0:14  it's OussiFooty in a Ronaldinho  Barca jersey !
You could see kepa on 4:57
BELLIGOAL!
People who saw oussi and a fan  👇
Oussifooty 😂
BELLINGHAM IS THE FCM RMA GOAT
Descirbe a lucky win: This game!  No offense to reak Madrid but barca had the game if it wasn't for them missing chances and of course belliingham appeared.
12:08 you can hear joselu 😂
Ferran should’ve been red carded. He’s been taking rugby lessons from Araujo it seems
I see ussi
Vin jr
That first one rocketed
I never expected that first goal 😮
Ferran tores really said. “Yo vini wanna play a quick game of rugby for no reason?”
What I would really like to know is.. how is Araujo literally hugging Camavinga to bring him down not a penalty? That was an insane non-call, wasn't it?
بارسلونا بزرگترین اشتباه تاریخ رو کرد اولین اشتباه از دست دادن لیونل مسی بود و دومین اشتباه این بود که هر چی بازیکن کارکشته داشت رو رد کرد برن درسته جوانها تازه نفس هستن قدرت و سرعتشون زیاده نفسشون زیاده ولی یک جوان پر قدرت و یک جوان سرعتی هیچوقت کاری که یک پاه به سن گذشته حرفه ای میکنه رو نمیتونه انجام بده  بازیکنایی مثل مسی و جردی البا و سوارز و ماسکرانو و نیمار سنشون از این بازیکنا بیشتره و زودتر خسته میشن ولی چون کارکشته و حرفه ای هستن خودشون رو خسته نمیکنن موفع گل زدن حرکت میکنن موقع بازی سازی حرکت میکنن موقع فریب دادن بازیکنا حریف حرکت میکنن و توپ رو به اون قسمتی که میخوان میبرن و همیشه گل میزنن بدون اینکه خسته شن مسی تو زمین راه میره چون میدونه الان وقت دریبل زدن و گل زدن نیست و به اون موقعیت که میرسه حرکت میکنه واسه گل زدن و چون خیلی بازی کردن کارکشته شدن میدونن چجوری بازی رو در بیارن یک جوان تازه کار یا توپ رو خراب میکنه یا از دستش میده و باعث میشه بازیکنا حریف به دروازه بان بدون مدافع گل بزنن
Esos arbitros
All pessi fans are crying and they aren’t sleep good on this day
😂 barcaca players are where???
I’ve never seen a Real Madrid team with so many black players WTH is going on?
VARcelona ghosted🤑🤑👻
Madrid had all the luck in the world that day. Ter Stegen slips up, 2 woodwork from Barca, and Jude’s 2nd goal 😭 Sunday will be different and Barca will win supercopa again! #3–1
I don’t know why LEWANDOWSKI didn’t start but if he did they would have won
When i have a bad day i come back to this moment last year 😂🫡❣️
Jude is going to be a legend at Real Madrid and with England. No doubt whatsoever.
HALA MADRID
Best goal I've seen in a long time. Unreal.
Bellingham a young GOAT! 🐐 HALA MADRID!!! 👑 ⚪️
He’s  so good he’s the goat
Bellingham might be the player of the season
Belligol
if barca had pedri they would have won
this game was not fair
Jude is litteraly a lightskin isagi/rin
Jude won he won it all
Who needs Mbappe? 😮
If he continues to play at this intensity, this energy, and no injuries. In a year or two, he will take where Benzeman has left.
These games are getting more ridiculous by the year😂😂 they look like children playing lol
American Football coaches in the NFL are showing gametape of Ferran's challenge to their defense saying, "now that's how you're supposed to tackle"
Why is Dani Alves on the stands
im commenting this on a school  laptop
Su padre de pedri y gavi 😂😂
No one is talking about oussifooty being in the screen for the beginning of
People Who Saw OussiFooty  👇
ahhh my man jude😋🔥🔥
12:01 he is so good than all bar a players
Oussi footy was on camera
Barcelona deserved the win, remember Real Madrid won four CLs in a row.
BELINGOAL
Should've been a straight red for Ferran...
Jude is the best youngster in the world, at this pace his taking the Ballon D’or next year
Real madrid da goat
kroos needs to be a substitute now
Learn how outside works lol 😂 fix it before I will
Bro how come no one noticed that oussifutty was on the camera
jjjjjjjuuuuuuuuudddddddeeeeee
imagine losing the game like that bruh barca is a joke after messi
- Your first El Clasico as a Madrid player - Barcelona take the lead early - You score to tie it up - You score Again to take the lead, *In Stoppage Time* - Full time, you are the player to score the only two goals, which grabs the win in the most famous matchup in world football  It was written in the stars for this brother to be something special. Unreal The sky is the limit for this young man
Bellingham keep cooking
9:08 is a rocket kick
ARAUJO NFL PLAYER
I feel like of Lewa didn’t get injured Barca would’ve won 2-0
kroos aint phased. Hes seen Cristiano do it a thousand times. so   cold
la liga is a joke
The goal at 9:08! And rhe game winner 11:53 !
BREAKING MESSI JUST WON HIS 9TH BALON DOR WITH 20 goals
Compare that Ferran yellow to Beckham's infamous red lol
They have fun with kepas name lmao
Where the Barca cry babies at?! lmaooo
VARMADRID
Messi you are my hero
Bring back old classico 😢
ok  wow.  Jude is  the law.  Wow.   NOT a talent like this since cristiano?? and before than since   the original 7  raul.   Opportune?  sure but  the first goal showed he is impressive and dominant.
😩 We should've never lost this clasico match, but whatever we won today against Real Sociedad.
World Class from Jude.
Real madrid attack is starting to see a new era! The defense... Has seen better days.
ESPN DONT EVER TALK ABOUT MY GOAT THE BICYCLE KICK YEAH I REMEMBER THAT WHEN YOU SAID RONALDO BICYCLE KICK  WAS IT REALLY INTENTIONAL? LIKE BRO FU$& YOU
Beem keeping tabs on Bellingham , my new fav player
Who needs Mbappe they got Jude Bellingham
Never though I'd say this about an englishman playing for real, but jude is the future. So young, yet so mature
Dimelo Jude… halamadrid 😎 13-13 el Clasico
Barcelona fan but Bellingham is the truth
I love the silence during the replay on that Araujo challenge in the box, really shows what the announcers are afraid to say.
What was this game????
A frieza do Kross quando o Bellingham faz o gol
Ref let too much go
Wanna be cr7😂
Rudiger:  "again! again for them!"   He knows a star
tame stuff. 2005 to 2015 classico was an absolute legendary war.
Absolutely he's the Hero
That touch by Modric was unbelievable
offside bro
What was that going on between Carmavinga and the defender? Doesn't look like he just went down too easily, does it?
Bellingham will be the goat he’s the best player itw rn
That's an absolutely iconic strike from Jude
Modrics touch to Bellingham for the 2nd goal was either pure luck or pure genius. 😅
Are they holding mick hostage? Mate looks misreable
I can not believe how good JUDE BELINGHAM is! He shows everyday how incredible he is.
Perdimos sorldados pero siempre ay revancha
Hala Madrid for life 🤍🤍
I love you Real Madrid and Bellingham. ❤❤
Jude THE GOAT❤
ESPN FC - Why would you make the title of the video something that gives away the outcome? I'm tuning in to watch the highlights because I couldn't watch the game. Who does that? Just say Barcelona v Real Madrid with the date. Do you want me to never click on your videos?
I absolutely love the ability for coaches to "gently" touch the cheeks of the oppenents (ex Xavi). Its hilarious and also endearing so see the way players respond knowing they are wrong.
The video quality on this stream is phenomenal. Makes me want to get my referee license. Don't really know why.
Objectively offsides
what a penalty on camavinga by araujo........
Ferran tried to make Sports Center Top 10 Plays. Ferran tried to make the Baltimore Ravens practice squad.
As a mid fielder this is Madness !! As a Barcelona Fan ❤I’m loving both this teams . Love it. Haaland, Mbappe, Bellingham wow
Dude is balling tf out.
Good match...Super thankful we started with a W against them this season.
Halland and Mbappe might have missed their only chance at a Ballon D'or with this guy lurking at Madrid.
11
Jude Bellingham will retire a Real Madrid and English football legend, and Luka Modrić will still be playing centre mid for RM at 60 years old.
I loved the no calls, just let em duke it out until ole boy made a full on head n shoulders tackle on Vini lmao
The level is kind of really far from those of 10 years ago
Amazing performance by Jude man
Hey Jude... Oh Bellingham,  Take A Bad Game And Make It Better... The Minute You Kick That Ball Into The Net...  Then You Will Begin To Make It Better... Laaa, Laaa La La La La Laaaa... Laaa Laaa Laaa Laaa, Hey Jude!!
FC24 better fix his card I need it higher than a 95 at least.
Hala Madrid y nada mas 🤪
Am a Barcelona fan 120%, to be honest, Madrid deserves this one but remember this Madrid will never beat us if we're playing with full key players as they do but we do manage to beat them without our key players if you are a Barcelona fan let me see your thoughts.
Yeah Jude Stole the show but Barca played better 😴
I bet bellingham would score against man city
Barsa couldn’t get no satisfaction 😂
-
Legendary 2:1  👏👏👏 that’s  Legendary well done !  Real Madrid  !! hala Madrid !
bellingham isn't 100 million bro is priceless
Bellingham has the emotion that Gundogan was talking about. It’s what wins games
Can’t wait to see a Haaland Vs Bellingham game. It’s been so cool watching them both “grow up” at Dortmund and become top top players for two of the best teams in the world rn
Bellingham passed bluelock
Ro wowe out off
Uje urge eug wowe out off
Irop wowe out off
Eilp wowe out off
Elp wowe out off
Scruup wowe out off
Ovher 100 wowe out off
Sculpched wowe out off
everyone talking about Bellingham but on his second goal Modric when he hit the ball against the ground like that was for sure a top 5 play this season. The skill from him is insane.
This is nothing compared to the old el Classico’s.
10:25 was a clear penalty
Bellingham 👍
If u look at FCB back line there are 3 defenders on the same line except the left CB who I think deserves blame for that goal. Had he been lined up with the rest of the team at least we get a point. It's called discipline which he clearly doesnt have.
BELLIGOL BELLIGOL
Bellingham proved that he's a beast with his 2 goals. If there was ever a time to perform, it was against Barca, and he delivered!
Which one was better, the result or the fact that the Madridistas were singing a Beatles song in front of The Rolling Stones?  😅 Nah nah nah - nah nah nah nah Hey Jude!
What a lucky win for real. I didn't see anything from them except for their goals
Every time I see Rodrigo play, he gets worst and worst. He does not lift his head
Modric is a magician even when he touches the ball by accident haha
3:53 This is the kind of timeless video that you would send to aliens to show the beauty of human sport. Just breathtaking. Well done to the production team.
Bellingham giving me hope in Madrid 😭
I have a question if the Bible is just a myth why do all of your problems come from doing the opposite of what scripture says?
HALA MADRID
Is this the same Kepa who used to play for Chelsea??
I think Vini needs some mentorship. But i can't think of any OG in the Real Madrid squad that he'll listen to right now
Agreed with the commentaries
That shot is when you put the sliders all the way up in Fifa
who else saw oussifooty at the start
You know el Clasico is a big deal that’s why Sir Mick Jagger is in the stands… Ilkay is the truth man even though he’s a bit older he’s still a top player, but he needs more productivity from the rest of the Barcelona players… Jude proved my predictions of his talent… The Premier League should’ve snatched him when I said because now you see what I predicted…
Free Judestein!
Lmao tackled Vinicius Jr like it was American football😂💀
Jude is slowly starting to take on that Benzama role which i absolutely love hopefully Vini Jr. And Rodrygo can start to get going
Bellingham, the best acquisition after CR7 y Benzema
Bellingham busted Ter Stegen 😂
Holy cow the blatant diving from Barca was nuts.  Gavi going for an Oscar there at the end of the first half.  Why, of WHY, don't FIFA make yellow cards for blatant dives retroactive based on a post match review?  Combined with suspensions for accumulated cards, that would put a stop to diving REAL quick.
As a [insert team nobody cares about] fan, Bellingham is crazy
Jude is special.  Let’s all enjoy these days when it’s still surprising how insane his talent is.  No words for this lad.  True phenom of the sport
Fine. The hype is real.
KENNEDY 2024
How’s Jude Bellingham playing seems like 100m seems cheap 🤣🤣🤣🤣
A non-factor for the first 70 minutes, Bellingham hit a rocket on the first goal and - as usual - put himself in the right place at the right time on the second. On the other hand, Vini Jr is an embarrassment (not just for Madrid, but for the sport in general). A shame because his tremendous talent is overshadowed by his constant flopping and theatrics. He'd do well to take lessons in sportsmanship (and self-respect) from guys like Bellingham, Kroos, and Benzema.
Lol The Rolling Stone band have no clue what’s going on 😭
That stadium was straight trash just like the city it’s in 😂
How was that tackle on camavinga not a penalty ???😭😭😭
Bellingham is HIM
Bro is him it’s simple as that. I liked him over Pedri and Gavi two years ago as a Barca fan others called me crazy and a fake fan but I know what I see. Pedri and Gavi are still good but they aren’t on Bellingham's level at all
FREE PALESTINE !!
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
I love Barca and Bellingham, mfs with B be it
The commentator said, "Good refereeing😢 Ronald CLEARLY foul Cama...😂😂😂😂😂😂
Someone needs to turn off the cheat code on Bellingham already.
Santi Gimenez would be such a perfect fit for this team. Young and talented. I’m excited for the new era of El Clásicos to come
@12:23 Rudiger 😂
We just need Mbappe
bellingham is deifinitely not an average player however, I'd like to point out how low the quality of football in spain has fallien over the years. Ten years ago, bell would be doing 5x of what he's doing now to have had any recognition. props to him tho
Jude should just go all out at the CAM position like there is no point of playing defense mid or holding mid with these much goals and not being a straight up #10 fu** it just play cam and score more goals
Very impressive by barca to pretty much control this game and have more chance. Good lucky win.
Bro Torres literally violated Vini smh so blatant
how was Jude the same price as Maguire ?? that is just wild 😀
stop putting results in caption
Bro got stats like me in FIFA 🤣🤣
Bellingham this, Bellingham that. Where was he throughout the whole game before his first goal? (Which was crazy)
The magic of Modric makin that assist to Bellingham isn’t talked about enough cuz that’s pure masterclass n a masterpiece of a masterful n magical assist
Antony > > > > > Bellingham
Camavinga no penalty?
how is no one commenting about how awful the refereeing was? two rugby tackles, one in the box, and the only punishment was a single yellow card???
Thru the legs, wow….legendary
Xavi got that Karma for being a complete dickhead
*Just sing along*     *Na Na Na .......................Na Na Na Na .....................Na Na Na Na..........................Hey Jude*
As a Barca fan, it’s always sad whenever we get beat by Madrid but my god did Bellingham put in a performance. Can’t even be upset when it’s a treat to see this kid perform at such a high level every game
Bellingham is Kevin Prince Boateng cranked to 99.
Unfair game most barca players are injured
HALA MADRID 😂😂👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
that rolling stones sponsor makes Barca look like they have the gayest ever kit in history.
Even as a Barca fan I gotta agree that Bellingham is one of the best players in the world and most definitely best signing this summer. No hate but he definitely scores a good amount of tap-ins, like the winner in this match. Ter stegen definitely could’ve done better but in my opinion, it is the hardest position to play, coming from a goalkeeper who used to play outfield. With the winner goal, if he had closed his legs he might’ve saved it, but he didn’t have time to and having your legs spread out like that is better. With the screamer, Ter stegen was I not in the best position, a bit much too the left, and with the power of the shot he had less than a second to react when the ball was moving that fast. Im talking about the screamer here> The player that headed the ball away to clear it(don’t remember who) and went to a Madrid player was a mistake. Once again he didn’t have much time to react so he just did what most people would do, head the ball. If I were him I would’ve taken a touch and pass it back to ter stegen or a defender so they could clear it. I don’t know why I just typed all of that but I did. That’s all
how was it not a pen?
Simeone said Bellingham plays better and gets more chances when a striker plays with him. He never got into a scoring position or in the box before Joselu came on.
that touch from Gundogan is nuts, after alaba hits it. rewatched it 3 times in slow- mo and the anticipation is still nuts.
them real madrid fucks got easy. if me and my gang saw them it would be all out. austin joel and hemish would body them
Much respect to JB, but EC just doesn’t hit it. Like it used to, looks like mls playing..
9:11 is why RM is a speciial team
Time to change coach because xavi is killing Barcelona
As a barça fan I can say Bellingham is crazy
Miss the Messi Ronaldo Era
I just want mbappe in the white Jersey
Longest intro ever
It was a close game with neither side really playing amazing, But man Bellingham is truly special, a Madrid legend in the making, just wish he played for Barca instead 😂
Barcelona finally got a new owner, sources told me his name is Jude Bellingham 🫲😤🫱
I’m a Barcelona fan and Jude is something else yes he was ghost 2/3 of the game but give this man a little open and he will win you the game. Just a day before I saw Real Madrid fans complaining that Jude was overrated and that they wanted mbappe before Jude I’m sure those dudes eating their own words
Barca needs Messi 😢💔
It’s ridiculous how many people are considered “world class”… used to be reserved for the top 3 players on the planet
The Ref in this game💀💀💀
Omg jude is crazy tho
After the way the first half went, where Barca could've put away the game if they'd converted even 1 or 2 more chances, and knowing that half the starters were out with injury - I'm confident we'll take Madrid easily in the 2nd Clasico.
Hola barcelonistas
We are missing that messi threat on the attack, how is our defense and midfield threatening the goal more than our attack
The Byrds over The Rolling Stones and Real Madrid over Barcelona.
El clásico ain’t the same anymore. Regardless of wins
9:28 lmaoo
im a liverpool fan and imagine if we had the money to sign him, we would probably be topping the premier league right now
Hi
If Barca didn’t miss the goals by hurt hitting the post they would’ve won
Just wow
11:18 How was this NOT a penalty?? Crazy.
Predict Bellingham will win the next ballon dor.
As a Barca supporter, Bellingham is a player who lives up to the expectations, 100m well spent and he’s only 20! Good match
bvb have been making wonderful players . This kid is truly special .
Bellingham might even surpass ronaldo bro is the next goat
What an FC 24 goal at the end lol
Buen gane,Hala Madrid. Los jugadores del barza todavia estan hablando solos en la plaza de barcelona
Ballingham is killing it. ⚽️⚽️⚽️
The best of the best !!!and he is from Real Madrid 😅😀⚽️⚽️⚽️
Bellingham Saves The Day...For The...Merengues...Vamos Madrid...Hala Madrid...!!!!
Who are the guys at 3:29
In conclusion, Bellingham utilized all the opportunities properly, however Barcelona also had same opportunities but they failed to grab those opportunities.
Honestly credit to Barcelona’s B team, they’ve been doing good. Completely dominated first half.
Gavi's masterclass is gonna go under the radar. Such a shame.
my club <3 if we manage to win the ucl bellingham ballon dor is clear
So many celeb posers at these clasico games
No Madrid fans there lol
Players are considered world class with stats like Jude's at the end of the season, this is literally madness. 13 games, 13 goals and 3 assists. Still many games to go. A 100 mil signing actually living up to the price
A star was born 🙏🏽⚽️
Kroos was like I am too old for this 😮‍💨
Jude Bellingham at his prime
GOD CREATED US TO LOVE US AND EVEN THOUGH WE SINNED AGAINST HIM HE DID NOT ABANDON US,BUT MADE A WAY FOR US TO BE RESTORED TO HIM THROUGH HIS SON JESUS;WHO DIED IN OUR PLACE AND IS RISEN...TRUTH.PRAYING IS TRUSTING THAT GOD HEARS YOU WHEN YOU SPEAK TO HIM AND MEANING WHAT YOU SAY...LETS PRAY,LORD JESUS I BELIEVE AND WELCOME YOU INTO MY LIFE,AMEN.*READ AND SPEND SPEND TIME WITH GOD DAILY,PUT YOUR TRUST IN HIM*ASK GOD TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HIS WORD*ALLOW THE HOLYGHOST TO LEAD YOU...I LOVE YOU BUT GOD THE TRINITY LOVES YOU UNCONDITIONALLY.
Ballon d’or Judy!!!!
I think the heroes of the match is Modric and Camavinga… Bellingham was just lucky. The guy was clueless …only after Modric and Camavinga he did something. Also taking out Joao, Cancelo was a huge mistake… and Putting Romeu was the biggest of them all
actually cant stand this commentator and idk why
Jb for Ballon Dor
Everyone is talking about Bellingham and ignore the impact of Modric and Camavinga ...Ancellotti is a genius in making his changes
my dream I want to be soccer players
Bellingham just stole 3 points Barca deserved from this match. What a shame for them
Some very selfish players at the front for Real Madrid . Not playing for as a team up front
Jude!!!
Seeing how Barca used bad faith in doing business with City over the past few years, as a City fan I couldn't be more happy watching them lose to Real.
0:15 oussie football!!
Great game
12:13 my reaction as well. What a game
I can't here you Barca you said he only scores tappins
In Germany, even the most rubbish teams, that everyone is making fun of for having no supporters, do bring more visiting supporters to their away matches than real madrid 🤣
Rolling Stones are overrated anyway
They need to just strike him at this point
Why was Kroos not happy after reals first goal?
That has to hurt for Barcelona, falling asleep on defense and losing a goal in the last seconds.
NO CAP JUDE BELLINGHAM IS HIM
Goal as good as his hairline. Second goal celebration is insane
i realize you dont take anyone out of the game in an el clasico but barca shouldve been playing with 8-9 men by the end of this. im fs biased but that tores rugby tackle and the araujo foul in the box looked like reds in the moment and on replay.
Caicedo and Jude are the same price😂
Bellingham...wow...what a performance...2 goals in El Clasico! He is sensational!
Besides his great talent, his maturity and demeanor are so impressive.
What was that reaction from Kroos to Jude’s goal lol
Post, referee, Jude. Real Madrid's 3 best players
13:11 Wow what a goal!
Those “tackles” on Vini and Camavinga from Araujo should be reviewed by FIFA because many refs call that obstruction, which it clearly is, but others don’t call it as we see here. Araujo completely ignores the ball, puts shoulder in the chest nowhere near the ball, and is not even looking at the ball while doing it. It’s clearly a last ditch tackle because he knows he’ll get beat in a pace battle so he drives his body into the player from the FRONT not the side. What do you guys think?
There will always be a bad 60 minute if anceloti keep starting kroos instead of camavinga 😢
I love how Vini just casually starts a whole conversation with Xavi, lol.
From a neutral fan's POV obviously it sucks for Barca to lose this game but the fact that they were able to go toe to toe with Madrid with all their injuries is very impressive. They got unlucky a few times this game by hitting the post and the deflection that led to Jude's winning goal. With a fully fit squad I think they will be a dangerous team. From a Madrid perspective they are missing that presence of a striker in their squad rn. Jude has been carrying Madrid on his back
anyone knows how much the referee was getting paid by Barca???
As a real Madrid fan all I can say is dammm thank you Jude and thank you for not let us down as well as everyone else thank you
Nunnca me senti identificado con el Madrid nisiquiera Ronaldo hacia palpitar el corazon de esta manera por un tipo! Amo al Liverpool pero Bellingham merece 5 balones de oro el chico es un astro
Barcelona's injury list is so bad that Cancelo is playing as a winger... 😂
It was the Gavi show.  Jude just stole the headline
That final assist from Modric. Can't be intentional, can it?
BELLINGHAM is built different
just shows what mbappe could’ve easily conquered if done the right decision
In the words of Jose Mourinho ,  the better team lost 😂 Jude is a special kid!
Hey Jude come back to Dortmund
referee  👨🏻‍🦯👨🏻‍🦯👨🏻‍🦯
We didn’t end up needing it but, Araujo definitely fouled Camavinga in the box 😅
Puro Barcelona
That tip from Modric though, lucky or not it still takes skill to hit it precisely like that.
As a Barca fan , respect to Bellingham 🤟🏼
We need to start making memes for how lucky Bellingham is
Barcelona always needed 2 goals to obtain a win against RM
When xavi overthinks the lineups Barcelona suffers. put the players where they go.....and O. Romeu second game in a roll that his lack of defensive follow up costs a gol.
Ok but the Rolling Stones sponsor is actually kinda cold 🥶
It was eintrach nou camp today change the name to jude nou camp.  Welcome to the new era.
From a barca fan. I was terrified of this match. Happy to see it could have gone either way. BUT wow Bellingham, he is special.
Cmon man
The el Classico will be good again when mbappe goes to Madrid and julien Alvarez plays for Barcelona.
Dont let this distract you from the fact that united signed sancho after desperately needing help in the midfield 😂😂
Vardrid back at it again
Finally my RM!! Hala M!
Thought this game was in Utah for a second. Didn’t know why the atmosphere felt like a summer friendly. I’ve seen more excitement in an arcade on a Saturday afternoon
I wish Dortmund had more funds to be able to keep players, we get our best players taken all the time 😢
He’s our guy! Hey JUDE! Take a sad song and make it better! Hala Madrid!
could have been 3-2
I'd say the 100 million was worth it
Bellingham is him
Fermin needs to quit doing those hit the post/crossbar drills in practice.  Dude be hitting em alot in games 😂
Hey this is random but I'm a new soccer fan and I was wondering about like the season I've done a little research so I know it runs August to may and it's 38 games with like tournament games mixed in but just my basic question is I guess wouldn't that make it more than 38 games and like does the season length mean from the current year August to the next year's may (August 2023 to may 2024 for example)
Barca fan and it’s not like we don’t know how Bellingham might turn out. Unfortunately he had his chances today but ay we got like 6 months left
Ferran using his MMA skills on Vini 😂😂
Ter stegan 😂
barcelona out here playing restlessing. no penalty and no red card
HALA Madrid
Funny how BVB players were the only ones to score.
Real Madrid!!!❤
A la Madrid ❤
Barcelona fans be rating Pedri and Gavi higher than Jude 😂
Midfielder putting up numbers a world class striker would have. Consistently. 🤯
I don’t understand why Ter Stegen doesn’t dive with two hands. Could have a better shot on saving the first goal. Smh
With alaba Real Madrid are automatically one goal down starting each game
No fans away 😂😂😂.  Reason why hands down premier league is superior by miles 😂😂😂
Kroos does not look happy after that goal everybody was claping jumping with joy but him
maybe england finally has a chance. everyone get out of his way
Barcelona deserved a win today.
The only time La Liga can say we have one on the Premiere League 😂😂😂
hey Jude
Thought the EPL have the worst referees but I was wrong.
Two average teams going at it.
Xavi complained a kit vini getting fouled but then cried when his team flipped. Loser
Xavi really messed up the line-up today 😅. If they started with Cancelo at right-back and Raphinha as winger they would have had a better chance. Not a very smart choice of formation in my opinion.
I’m speechless. Jude is something different
Bellingham <3
Yeah fair enough Jude. Helluva player.
Im quite..but proud of Barcelona, they played so well but unfortunately couldnt finish the job.
That’s Meg on the keeper 😂
The Bellingham effect !!!❤⚽️💪🏼📈
Best player in the world right now #5
Second goal for Madrid was just lucky. Modric tries to control it but fails then the ball bobs over the Barcelona defender right into Jude’s path for an easy tap in. Honestly, they were fortunate to even get a point from this game let alone all three points.
HALA MADRID
That first Bellingham goal was bonkers. It was as if the ball had been shot from a cannon.
16 g/a in 13 games as a midfielder is absolutely phenomenal. Even if he is an attacking midfielder. Bellingham is going to win a couple balon dors in his years. Heck, if he keeps up this form for the season, he might win it in 2024!
I am Madridista and have to say Real is awful...Play softer than a little Catholic School soccer league...They don't deserve Jude to be playing for them....
La Liga is too easy. Look at the difference when Ronaldo played in England, Italy, and Spain. Would score between 20-25 in Italy and England and in Spain he would score 30-40 goals
I’m so glad mbappe staying at psg
Bellingham is one of the worst players in term of aggression and sportsman I've ever seen
Classics aren't the same now without all the legends gone...
El classico matches were so fire and excited back then. Now it is just different
Jude Bellingham is the best English player for me..the best at the moment..stunning  goals from him..wow.
Jude Bellingham BALON DE ORO
Great game for the 2 clubs. Real Madrid never finishes to a surprise. More are coming. Wait and see.............
6:42 bro thinks he’s playing American football
Own barka dogs 🐕
Love it - Go Real -Fantastic
Jude at 100 mil was a bargain for real 😂
So with this England squad, Kane, Bellingham, Rice, Saka, Foden, Grealish...truly a golden generation?
wow, Bellingham is a whole different beast.
NAH THE REFS WERE SO BAD BARCEONLA WOULD OF WON BUT THE REFS WERE SO BAD
how its not a pen on Camavinga?
It looks like chinese tourists are making the classic match cheap and truly commericalized in the worst possible sense. Hope they did not bring the new covid23 to Europe.
I see several ex-Chelsea players we exchanged for utter thrash
Ok, as a neutral, Barca players were diving like crazy this match 😂
No spoilers in the title next time, dumb yanks
This guy is crazy
He is an amazing playerI,but ts sad that he is taking all the credit for it. Cam and modric are the true stars of the show.
I swear to God Cristiano would be proud of you just like Zidane 5️⃣. Juuuuuuuuude Bellingham
Glad to my captain  @Carvajal 💪 The legend
🏁
Jude best player in the world right now. Love to see it ⭐️
10 years ago, these teans were beasts.  Now, like ordinary teams
Devaluadisimo el clasico de españa jajajajajajajaj
This was great game sucks Barcelona not win wish they had the same energy in the first half to the second half. 🥺
Nice Madrid nice job
Dortmun BVB to the court of Arbitration : "The was a mistake in the price for Bellingham, he should've been 150 mil"
10:06 I’ve seen this before, reminds me of a lad who used to wear the #7
13 goals and 3 assist in 13 games. I know it’s a bit too early to say this,  Bellingham has the potential to become a football legend, and I’m saying this as a Barca fan despite feeling disappointed for the lose.
Did Modric try to pass him or wanted to calm the ball and score
Literally the next Kaka. The perfect trequarista. He can create, dribble, assist, and score goals.
Why do you put spoilers in the titles and thumbnails? That's dumb and significantly reduces the number of users who watch the soccer videos.
😂😂😂😂🎉
Why is nobody talking about how 15 seconds in and they showed a YouTuber😂😂
Why is it always Carvajal doing the cross to score a goal
Barcelona 😂
Everyone is talking about Bellingham but that Modric's pass was out of the world.
Bro honestly Jude is a mid player and that goal is so offside
@10:16 toni kroos with no emotion after the screamer from Bellingham 😂 he says" yes, this is correct job, good 😐 what's next?"
Bellingham is going to win the Ballon d'Or at this rate
real Madrid defiantly showed they were the better team that night but are they relying too much on bellingham bangers? They are not able to get simple goals like most in form teams like city and others. open to opinions
What a great game, both sides played well, but that Bellingham fella just cannot be stopped!
During the celebration of Bellingham's second goal, I think you can hear Rudiger telling Bellingham to address the traveling Madridistas once more: "again, again for them". Classy professional!
0:49 that’s a women right there… well done to the bf 🤝
Jude rude😂😂
Espn fc editing is just not good man. This is old news, poor quality.
Real Madrid’s future looking bright in Bellingham’s hands✨
Hes unstoppable 💯👑
The camera quality tho
Bruh what a sloppy game lmao
大英帝星 贝林厄姆
Couldn’t help to notice the commentators are more inclined to support Madrid and you can notice if you pay attention
Ian & McMannaman best season in 2012 they called every game It was the best season ever..!!!!!
Xavi needs to go
Didn’t know if there would be many statistically historic seasons in La liga history after Messi/Ronaldo departures, but my oh my is Jude putting up some historical numbers thus far
If Jude can lead this team and win the champions league, no doubt Ballon D’or winner
I really hope Bellingham's sudden storm of success doesn't diminish Rodrygo's confidence as a forward.
NUTMEG
From these highlights, it seems the ref was pretty consistent
The Pharoah does it again
Kepa stepping on the Pk spot hmmmm
Love how the Englishmen with some of the highest potentials know to play at the greatest club that's called Real Madrid.
Everyone’s talking about Jude but what a game by Camavinga! Came on for a surprisingly sloppy game by Kroos & lit up the midfield. Bellingham is something else.
Next Classico will be a Legends Classico where we can welcome back Cr7+Özil vs Messi10+Iniesta 😊😊
I miss navas and Courtois alreayd
Jude Bellingham Like Serial Killer,  👏 Amazing next Legend 👏 👌 😉 🙌
genuinely, what is bellingham on
First time Real Madrid wins against  Barça 😂
Dortmund produced💪
Madrid ,,,Madrid siempre Madrid😂😂😂😂😂eee👍
Finally an English player worth hyping up 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I've seen enough, at full strength Barcelona is better
Aha Shine on Jude
Reminds me of cr7
Hey Jude! Hey Dude! Take a comeback and make it better.
Jude better than Ronaldo
Halaaa madriid
i loved that tackle 10/10, I’m glad vini is good lol
I know he's being overhyped but Jide is doing what hes supposed to be doing. That first goal was 🔥. And his positioning is top notch
Awesome game Bellingham 😮😮😮
(Min 1:58) Keppa destroying the PK spot before the game with his cleats lol.
@oussifooty
Ousi made the highlights
Hey judeee!!!!
Siuuuu
Your first mistake was scoring against Madrid first…
Laliga is as boring as my maths class .
10:15 kroos was not impressed 😂
Great game, terrible ref decisions.
Mick jagger es mufa…..
I can't wait to see Jude Bellingham and Arda Guler playing next to eachother.
Give Jude the ballandor ❤
Hala Madrid
El segundo fue mejor vale por 2 por cocina
Camavinga and Modric had incredible games coming in as well. HALA MADRID!
CRBellingham
Should be a CF in false 9
Jude is that guy!! Kepa making mad saves at Madrid too!! Good for him 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Once again Camavinga was the game changer
Barca is Man City's next A team.  It's like Pep spending Man City money to build the players and then help his old club, Barca LOL
BELLINGHAM LIKE ZIDANE
that second goal from bellingham is the luckiest thing ive ever seen, unfortunate for barca
He is here because Southgate gave him international football at 17.
The fact that Araújo got away with all this bs holds is crazy
Modern day halland
10:23 how isn’t that a penalty?
Please stop ruining videos with the title. I promise you we are going to watch them without the clickbait :(
In my opinion Rodrygo needs to go on a loan 😢 he has way more potential, just needs more discipline ❤
I love how no of us expected this from Bellingham, I think we all recognized he would do well for Madrid. But to carry them as a cm/cam is just a unreal.
Best since Zidane.
Jude Bellingham is the best signing Madrid has had since Ronaldo and Benzema.
Barca lost this match because the strikers were selfish
Jude > gavi
Jude is the best young player in the world
chew on that, Mick Jagger
Billingham, the best
Ferín reminds me of Delafeau , wasted potential by Barca
Let go my RM, we love you Vinicios, Modrid   , everybody”. Real Madrid  “
Beautiful first goal from Bellingham. Great comeback. On the other hand, Vini is really annoying and childish, no wonder people don’t like him lol
Las momias Rolling   stone, VIVA Real Madrid , asi mismo el mejor de la liga Española
Hala Madrid
Terstergen could of done better that simple
But he only scores tap ins against small team 😂😂
jude best in the world rn no cap
i must say jude is ALOT better than i thought he would be for madrid.
First mistake was scoring first
I dont understand so many of todays players! Are they being taught in school how to fall over& not cope with  a Physical challenge/tackle? Is this where it all starts? It's embarrassing to see,they're top athletes,fit& strong and yet we see so much of this BS..Vernicus and Jaoe Felix should be ashamed of themselves! But a fantastic day for young Jude Bellingham..His first goal was a Rocket& he has very good Instincts,it's not luck that he pops up in the right place consistently!
Kroos didn’t look happy Bellingham scored
10:24 how was this NOT a penalty lmfaooo
Kroos should be ashamed its a team game and he wasnt playing well and when he had no reactions on the bench when jude scored was shameful
A mi compatriota Moisés Caicedo del chelsea le falta eso pegarle de fuera del área y es mejor que cualquiera mediocampista del mundo
Bellinghams next real christiano ronaldo
Lol Barca almost robbed another won, glad to see Real beat them again 😂
I really think the crossbar should be raised to 10 feet high. For the sake of football.
Not much of a reaction from Kroos to Bellingham’s wonder goal .
Bellingham is just ridiculous.
Hala Madrid!!!! But you know he still won't get his d'or
Terrible terrible ref
English commentary is so bad
Even though Real Madrid wins it needs sum improvement
Idk how that Araujo tackle on camavinga wasn’t a pen
Fluke Bellingham with another fluke and a tap in. 😂😂😂
Me quedo con la asistencia de Luka en el segundo gol 😂😂😂
13 matches. 13 goals. 3 assists. A 100m signing worth the 100m. Compare this to Enzo Fernandez and his 121m move to Chelsea. His stats? 9 matches. 3 yellow cards. Great signing Cheslea lol
Bellingham is a beast!
Yo what goal by Jude the 1st goal 🥅
Hey Jude 👋 😂 12:22 again for them ! Lol
Gavi what a player,
pedri who?
Even MMA didn’t help Xavi and his team. 😂
That has to be the worst front of short sponsor I've ever seen
Wow what a penalty on araujo in first half
@oussifooty
Barcelona still paying off the refs
Good game Real Madrid played well congrats from a Barcelona fan
Last goal so lucky 🍀
Alaba needs to be benched or put at lb and nacho in cb
13 goals 13 games, his first season, Ronaldo numbers.
dortmund shouldve gotten 200m for bellingham
Bellingham is WORLD CLASS! Good game!
I think someone should check on Keith and Mick.
That last goal was art. Definitely a cover finish.
Now all we need is mbappe and we win everything
that 100 mil price tag looking like a thrift store price. He absolutely should have been sold for more !🤯
Mashallah 😮
Bellingham really out here taking KDBS mantle for the best midfielder in the world , hopefully he can keep this up his numbers are already insane for a player in his position , I wish him nothing but the best but Madrid need to stop being so dependent on him there will be games where other players will need to take the step forward as well , vini today was disappointing ash bro needs to get his head in the game the fame is getting to him.  I know he is out of position but that’s no excuse for him to play as lazy as he does and have no drive all game.
Every el clasico in October barca loses remember these matches   Oct 24 2021 barca lost to real madrid 1-2   Oct 16 2022 barca lost to real madrid  3-1  Today oct 28 2023 barca lost to real madrid 1-2   Is a crazy thing but is this a good sign for barca to win all of there el clasico matches this season
Mbappe WHOO???
The commentry is so good😂😂😂
VAMOS REAL MADRID YEAHHHHHHHHHHH
That Reff was unbelievable, 2 penalties not given to Real Madrid and A red card. POS!
Barca fan here. Bellingham is dangerous, what a player. If I have to say the difference between Real Madrid and Barca, I’ll say it this way, Real Madrid made CR7, and Messi made Barca.   Congrats Real Madrid fans.
Ok, I’m getting a Bellingham shirt now
Oizzy was on the stadium 😂
Full on rugby tackles not called as fouls in the box. Pretty unbelievable. Not a fan of either team so no bias here, just shock
That player is gonna be the face of futbol pretty soon if not already. He’s got the look like David Beckham had. You can’t put a player that looks like a teenage mutant ninja turtle on the cover of FIFA.
As a United fan, it is such a treat to watch these World Class clubs face off against each other. So much history, so many legends, and a new one in the making with young Jude Bellingham, just an absolute superstar player! No moment is too big for this guy
Ancelotti is something else. Never lets them panic and play until the last whistle. Xavi played with the wrong cards. Youngsters were running out of breath late so he put Lewy and Raphinha in to put it away. 30 minutes is eternity for an aging veteran and a guy who is coming back from hamstring. Probably a nod for the Stones but terrible game management otherwise. In the second half Barca looking like a deflated balloon was an absolute pain to watch.
Barca had the chance to win and there’s nothing to be ashame about. Not happy to lose but we had the chance to win the game. What I can say is that we played with young players that don’t have the experience yet and it’s great to see them give it all and just the bad luck some goals didn’t go in. With that said, our young players really showed up and with more experience, next time they will not miss the chances. Felix was amazing and so was fermin. Yamal has quality and with more games he will improve and get the confidence to make the difference next time. This is definitely a good sign to see us not depending on old players anymore. Visca Barca💙❤️💙❤️.
Fermin has hit the post 4-5 times now in 3 games. Kid has some crazy good shot technique.
Looked like a pretty dreadful game. Gavi is soooo bad, my God. And terrible game by Ter Stegen.
I do like Jude B because he was in Dortmund. But Madrid is a bunch of 'suertudos' - incredible how Barca loses this game that way.
Definitely a foul om camavinga
Jude Bellingham 2024 ballon’dor winner
Jude did justice for us merengues🤍🗣💯💯
At the night time is better
Disgusting refereeing
He should be captain from now on
Thank you for the highlights wish didn’t show winner in thrumbnail
the reincarnation of zidane
Jude is insane rn
Madrid signings  Bellingham >>>>> Hazard
What a weird decision from the ref not to call the foul on Vinicius. The defender pushing the offensive player the same way they were going when they go to turn is textbook stuff.
Day by day Jude is reminding me of Cristiano's greatness. 😍😍😍
Liverpool miss out on not signing him
THIS IS A 100m SIGNING 🔥 Clubs take notes.
Yet again barca doesnt end the dam game we deserved it
Not sure rugby league referees should be used in football games
I'm thinking we have the new goal killer. Estoy pensando que tenemos el nuevo matador del futbol un Crack este muchacho
Camavinga played so good and modric i mean one of the best center midfielders ever and Jude honestly what hes doing right now is crazy 🤣
As a Barca. Fan Bellingham might become one of or the best Madrid player but can’t surpass Ronaldo
Alaba tackles the other direction and that goal almost definitely doesn't happen. Barca was fortunate the other defenders were caught flat-footed, but that was still very silly
Ronaldo>Messi
Bellingham has very quickly gone from the one of the best young players in the world, to one of the best players in the world, period! What a performance for his first Classico.
referee is dumb... so many wrong decisions..
Ala Madrid!!!🤍🤍
Goodness me this lad Bellingham 😮,  world class
This referee is so bad.
All about Bellingham, wow. Lucky Madrid but gotta hand it to Jude, absolutely on 🔥
“All of his goals are tap ins”  well, you kinda have to be in the right place at the right time for it. 🔥
Everyone saying judes a tap in merchant dont understand how hard it is to successfully get the space and time the runs to even be set up for a tap in at that level
Now they gona say this fool will b like messi just cause hes having a little moment😂😂😂😂😂
Camavinga is  the game changer
This is the new el classico but it can ever be the prime el classico
united had a chance have this guy ....
He is him.
Everyone talks about haaland and mbappe, but I think this guy will be at the top after 10 years
Jude Bellingham is something else hoping he can keep it up and stay HEALTHY excited to see his stats in several years
Jude is unbelievable. So amazed. He keeps surprising me somehow.
Jude is that dude
I didn’t watch the game, but these highlights make it look like RM was getting their butts kicked. And what’s up with the defense? I am a very big Alaba fan, but lately it seems like he’s always around when the other team scores. Don Carlo has to tighten this up.
Real Madrid luckiest team ever,  Barcelona dominated the whole game ( as always), we just hit the post so many times plus no penalty on Araujo and red card for foul on Felix, sure  Bellingham is the monster, 🤣😂🤣😂. There was only one team in this match and that was Barcelona.period
Penalty by araujo against Cama. . xd!!! Bellingham plays nothing but make goals xd. its incredible that this guy has the touch to score goals. it's incredible!! he is in the correct position, in the correct time. i cant believe it xd xd.
I think Rodrygo gets sold at the end of the season
9:09 banger..wow what a baller.
Espn never fails to spoil the game before I can even finish reading the title
He is Him.
It’s just a shame he wasn’t ready/willing to make the jump to the Premier League yet. Incredible player, would love to see him at the highest level of the game
Real madrid are so poor, jude is herculean, without him theyd have about 10 points this season
Who else saw oussi fut
Hate this fool... English wanker. Waiting for him to fail.
The best player in the world rn no doubt about it
Nacho looks to Kroos thinking “who IS this guy?? He won’t stop?!” 😂 10:15
Legend in the making for Real Madrid!! 🔥🔥 Barça fans should compare any of their players to him ever AGAIN!!   -Bayern supporter
Wonder if MacManaman's heart skipped a beat to see his countryman net @ the death, been there done that, then
Here’s a few neutral observations. Madrid was very sloppy, unorganized and slow. Barca dominated but was not direct enough. They scored off a defensive error, and even thought they had chances, they didn’t utilize them. Real was dead u til they equalized. Still sloppy but managed to put the pressure in. Winner was similar to Barcas goal. Miss-controlled by Modric, defender didn’t get it and fell to Jude. Overall average game for both. Barca needs to work on their opportunities. Real need to play more smoothly, many times there’s no one in the middle to create triangles and move the ball. They also need to be more direct in attacks. Vinci was terrible, he completely lost the emotional game. Also raphinha, keeps cutting in into his left, way too predictable. Needs to switch it up.
Atmosphere looks horrid
Barca who?
Yo is that oussifooty at the beginning in the stands in a ronaldinho shirt?
I know people don't want games to be "decided" by a penalty etc., but Camavinga getting tackled like it's the NFL has to be a penalty there lmao
Bellingham reminds me of CR7. Clinical, decisive, motivated, carrying the team at their most vulnerable.
Next year Jude Bellingham can be ballon d'or
Bellingham is not normal. Investigate him for doping.
Bellingham is the real golden boy, Pedri is the banquillo wood boy. We have Dembele 2.0 at Barça
Does anyoen think that this ref was sleeping a bit? I mean lewa got pushed down infront of the ref, plus i think it was felox who got pushed aswell,
I’m wish the title wasn’t a spoiler
Instant classic, holy cow!
The passion he has for wearing a Real Madrid shirt is on full display.
Tony kroos is losing the ball too easily nowadays
Tappingham the hero!
Great work
7:16  My man was playing the wrong football  Thats a 15 yard penalty automatic 1st down 😂😂😂
Gundogan composure though for the 1st goal,not necessarily an easy finish, so players will have kepa saving that!
ferran making a touchdown saving tackle on vinicius
Empty stadium for a clásico 🙁
Them Barcelona fans was sick after this second goal celebration
bro bellingham is messi
Why the barca defenders always putting their hand up instead of defending. Its like they know their best chance is to get the ref to raise the flag rather than their own ability to do their job.
VAR unsurprisingly didnt check obvious penalty on araujo from touchameni, what a surprise espn doesnt mention just barely shows it 7:26
Bellingham is making me a believer.
Bellingham single handedly endonf racism in madrid
Barca came to wrestle and still lost
Bellingham?
He’s just got that touch
Karvahal
Jude actually played terribly, gavi had him on a leash. Yet he pulled this win out the bag. Even on a bad game he is clutch.
Camavinga got Mma’ed in the penalty box, still no penalty
Next gen Real Madrid 🔥
Man I’m a bigg Madrid fan!! But I was embarrassed on how vinvi jr acted and his lack of being a team player. He lost the ball and never ran back on D . Thank god for number 5  He was the hero . And the subs were prefect. They really changed the game
Ala Madrid
First Classico: he showed up. That’s how big players do. Hala Madrid!!!
Lmao 😂😂😂 at the commentators 9:10
10:17 Toni Croos was still calm asf after that rocket 😂😂😂😂
Bet ESPN mad mad now
Anyone see Oussouiiiiiiii in the beginning
While everybody praises Jude, I will highlight Carvajal performance today.
Jude is him
BARCA BARCA BARCA BARCA BARCA BARCA ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Poor Gundo. Showing up again in a critical game but can’t get the win today
But Liverpool didn't wanna pay the 100 mil but bid that on caecido?? Smh this is the generational talent that got away from us.
The sound the ball made when Bellingham scored the first goal was insane 🚀
Mendy is not Real Madrid material, Rodrigo needs to be benched in favor of Joselu, he hasn't been playing well in a while. None of them are well, especially Vinicius, he is worried about everything except playing football.   Vinicius will probably end up like Robinho, instead of playing he is allowing the nonsense in his head get in the way. If he doesn't change he will end up as a nobody like Robinho. Ancelotti and Florentino Perez better have a talk with Vinicius and tell him to shut up and stop getting into arguments with other players, the fans and arguing every play with the referees, and start playing football or he's out. He is becoming a spoiled brat and wasting his talent.  Camavinga has to play all of the time, he should be untouchable for Ancelotti. I sometimes cannot understand Ancelotti, why doesn't he make the necessary adjustments and continues to have confidence in 3 players that are not there.
I swear that Bellingham's game model is like the French player Zinedine Zidane
Gundogan showing up when it matters the most. And Bellingham carrying the team, showing his love for Madrid.
Hay un penal claro con ronald Araujo lo tomo dentro dela área para que tienen el bar
Compared to all players who have been sold for 100 million plus, Jude has actually been worth it
Man I wish Barcelona won this Èl Clasico but congrats on Real Madrid winning!
This match feels ai generated
@ESPNFC It would be great if you stopped giving hints at who won in your video titles. A lot of people watch recaps because they can’t watch the game and it’s nice to watch without already knowing who wins.
This is what 100 million dollars should get you
The ref is Madrid biggest fan 🤙
The guy its not even a forward 😅😅😅 13 goals in 13 games is insane.
He’s unreal
Modric got an assist just like that eh. Legendary!!
Best mid? Correction currently best "player" in the world . Ballon d'or 2024 his first.
Hala Madrid
The Barca missed to capitalized on several opportunities and played very good in the first half. In the second half the Barca slowed down because RM was dominant. The Barca looked very tired and out of gas. The Barca should utilized more of the young players.  Felix and Gavi should be retired by Xavi. Canello does not fit as RB because he is too slow to return to his position. He should play as a midfielder.. The same problem for Christensen in that he is too slow to get back. Baldi is a good player but is not accurate in his passes. Thus, he is useless.Those players should be dealt with by Xavi. Go Barca and there are more games to come
Jude Bellingham is levels ahead of gavi and pedri. There is no debate
He is only 20
I’m what world is 10:22 not a penalty? 😂
How we miss İlkay Gündoğan in really need of him . Always will be a cityzen
If England have a chance of winning World Cup 2026 will be because of Belli
And they said that Real Madrid was scare of Barcelona hahahahahahahahaha
tongue out like mike & bean
No penalty given for araujo rugby tackling camavinga in the box??? Ref is delusional for not even checking it.
Scoring goals don’t make you the best midfielder
Camavinga and Jude Bellingham are magic
It’s crazy because Jude isn’t that amazing of a player but my God he’s been on a run. I hope he really continues being world class
What a robbery!!!!😢
De Jong and Pedri are pivotal for Barcelona, the game needed them today.
Should hve been 2-2
why does barca have lips on their jersey
Jude Bellingham only scores on small clubs lmaooooo
Real Madrid defenders are real sloppy
INCREDIBLE
Lucky win
Bellingham next year’s ballon winner after Messi’s on Monday.. sorry haaland’s fans
Jude has to win Ballon D'Or if he's going to score like this. I haven't watched any full Madrid games, haven't seen how he plays in the midfield, but if he keeps winning important matches with goals, then you have to give it to him.
Mbape ? Who the f**k is Mbape ?😂
I had my doubts when Real Madrid acquired him, but not anymore. The dude is the real deal, I hope he stays healthy and injury free!!
Lol you can tell how new El Clasico is to Jude because he had no clue how to celebrate the first goal. He'll learn and it will be amazing to watch him dominate many other Clasicos to come  If he had shush'd the stadium Raul style omg it would have been lights out
With all respect, kepa needs to go. We need Courtois back
6:42. Should be a red.  7:24. Should be a penalty.
dont spoil it in the title loser espn!
Barca paying the refs again I see casual Barca
Game would’ve been different if they would’ve called that PK that’s should’ve been called.
Even tho they play different sports Jude to me is the most similar athlete to Kobe imo. Bro fs has that mamba mentality.
If he's always "fortunate" then it is a skill. Bellingham is an example of top football IQ.
Madrid got lucky
In your house and with your people 👊✅
Rodrygo out Mitoma in
Bellingham marcará una era. No será la era de Haaland o Mbappe,  será la era de Bellingham el hombre que remontó al 90+2.
Refere should retire
We can agree if Jude Bellingham was in Barcelonas roster, we would destroyed Madrid 😂
Give Ferran a Red Card there you moron!!!!
Bellingham is on fire 🔥
'Hey, Jude' Bellingham. What a player.
Frick bellingham
Real Africa vs Barcelona 😂😂😂😂😂
But good l madrid won (my favorite team)
Jude's celebration is so cool!
This guy destroys BARCELONA single handedly 😂😂😂
Bro the referee had to wake the f up he was just modeling doing nothing
“AGAIN, AGAIN FOR THEM!” 😂😂
A god
The bozo gene of this defence is wild
How is that not a pk on Camavinga at 79'16?
Jude is quality it’s not luck or just a good start of a season for him he’s a good player that can become a world best because he’s just 20 years of age still a lad pretty much but his ability maturity and quality shows each games that he plays
the fans look dead asf
Jude wins the ballon d'or if england goes far in the euro24
Why spoil the result?
Bro Barcelona we’re committing rugby challenges
🗣️Stop tipping results in the highlights video titles.
How is barca getting aways with all these rugby tackles
Is that freaking Mick Jagger at 9:25???
A nice goal and luck AGAIN.
Him and Harry actually worth 100m
Comeback kings ❤️❤️❤️
barca fam here man what a goal from jude to tie and that last one with the lil deflection was lucky asl but great game with tons of excitement still bummed we lost but half the season is still left!
Thank you Dortmund for finding our Gem. HALA MADRID
The numbers speak for themselves but the confidence this guy gives off is off the charts .
Jude Bellingham, GOAT in the making!!!
Barcelona fans were hyping up this game so hard 💀💀💀
we only lose to madrid when we put these stupid logos and icons on our shirts bro
This is like peak CR7 production.
When will Madrid learn Alaba is not a CB
That Block on Camavinga inside 18 yards box tho..🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
How was that not a penalty?
as a dortmund fan I love to see bellingham playing great. madrid is able to provide him with the quality of a team and environment he never got at dortmund.
Varcalona nothing without pessi 😢
This dude jude bruh 🤣🔥🔥🔥😭
If Jude maintains half this form throughout the season and wins La Liga he has a VERY strong case for the Balon D'Or. Doesn't even need to win the UCL IMO, his individual performances are THAT good.
Modric with the game winning assist 🔥
Madrid always seems to play Barca at the worst time for Barca Some of our best players Frenkie, Pedri, and Kounde being out really hurts but it is what it is
0:44 cameraman sus
When you don't score your chances you get scored on. Credit to Bellingham though.
Bellingham plays just like Kaka ngl
Para k sepan kien es papá. Y no lloren chikillas
Is no one talking about Ferran's NFL tackle on Vini Jr? Vini taking it in stride? That should have been a red.
Hala Madrid!  Fuc FC Basuralona - No mes que un merda de club -
That tackle had me dead lmao!!😂😂😅🤣🤣
Ballon D'or form
you can't just start a team full of youngsters & unwanted epl stars, wearing that joke of a jersey and expect to win the game...  😆
What is oussi doing bro
Ref was trying so hard to make Barcelona win😂😂😂
This guy is on the fast track for the next ballon d or.
This guy worth every penny 😂😂👍🏼👍🏼
imagine jude a a poaching #9😷 or someone at real madrid needs to get rid of modric so jude can have #10 he deserves it
HALA MADRID
This referee though
Don't forget on second goal by Bellingham, Luka's touch to put the ball right in front of him!!!
Horrible reffing missing that American football tackle on camavinga by araujo was crazy
looks like madrid may have finally found their cr7 replacement
Un Balde de agua fria para Balde y Barcelona. Que no Kepa la duda que kepa fue importante en la victoria.
Though I was rooting for Barca, I have to congratulate Real.
hey jude~~
Bellingham is the goat idgaf 🔥🔥🔥
Those runs reminds me of lampard, if he can keep it up he'll be as good as he was
Camavinga is just as important as Jude 😎 love both of them 🔥
Yooooo ferran torres American football tackled Vini
vini is embarrassing
People Whos know or saw oussifooty 👇
That was insane. Period and full stop. Bellingham megged Ter Stegen with the winner, and el classico has ended w Real. Hala Madrid!!!
Madre mia lo de este tio jude 💯💯🔥🔥 salvo al madrid HALAMADRID
Barca got away with some questionable calls
Camavinga need to get the respect he deserves
Can wait to see England at world cup in the USA. Wow. Bellingham would be the best player. Hoping England vs France. Kilian Vs Bellungham. Book that.
Kroos is becoming a liability. id much prefer to start valverde Toumani and Camavinga in the middle. We need the youngsters to start so they can run around. Modric still a beast but putting him in in the second half is the best call
9:09
Player of the year he should consider ballon dor
Jude just finds the right spaces. Thats high iq. Tap ins, bangers, doesnt matter hes doing it better than any other right now
Laliga has the best slomos. That slo-mo on bellingham screamer... 👌
Bellingham proving he wants to play for Tottenham for less money with every goal he scores. ⚽
Espn fc aka varca fc aka pessi fc are so mad and crying rn💀
an unintentional amazing assist by modric or intentional who knows its modric lol. Jude is just too good one of the best signings we had to real in awhile. Gotta say ref was not calling some fouls that camavinga foul in the box was 💯 a penalty. Vini Jr was just trash this game spent to much time complaining then focusing on taking players on and scoring. Overall we got the dub. Hala Madrid !
It was a good game. Barca looked really good first half and fell off completely 2nd half. As a Madrid fan, barcas youth did extremely well. The rivalry ain’t going away anytime soon lol but my boy Bellingham!
Aside from Bellingham’s performance the refereeing was pretty bad most the match was them wrestling lmao 😂
Soon as Ancelotti made that sub for Modric whole tempo just changed with him on that pitch, and Bellingham is still him, Hala Madrid
Some questionable officiating. There were some clear fouls that should have been given to both sides. At least it was equally bad officiating 😂
We are truly witnessing the birth of a new superstar. A star boy in every regard
I’m gunna ignored all those missed calls for Real Madrid. Is getting bad
That *deflection* from modric was 💯 percent calculated and purposeful. He is just such class. Top 5 midfielders of all time. 38 and playing like he’s in his prime. Insane
Bellingham may be the best player in the world currently. This run of form from him since moving to Madrid has been sensational
Why is no one talking about that horrible tackle against camavinga. Easily a penalty any day
FAKE VADRID PRIZED BALLINGHAM 100m+ and a HAM STEAK🥩 WITH A LARGE SILVER FORK FOR THAT TRANSER HAHA
Camavinga must start every game
Best player in the world
i  think jude  might win ballon dor
not the thumbnail spoiler 😭
FAKE VADRID IS A MAN-MADE CLUB…NO PRIDE BEHIND THAT BADGE, FULL OF OUTSIDERS TO DO THE DIRTY WORK…🤌🏻
Gavi assisting Bellingham 😂
If I was Vini, I would have gone to Xavi and grabbed his face like he did to him earlier in the game trying to get inside his head 😂
Where was this game at? This looks like America.
Terstegan is not the keeper he use to be
The Kings 🤴 are Back  Halaaaa Madriddd 🍺
He is him.
people who saw oussifoty at the beginning 👇👇
I think Jude should wear the armband since how hard he carried team 😂
fake vadrid litterlay has to PAY OUTSIDERS 100m + to have sucksess, fake vadrid is not a homegrown club lol…THERES NO DIGNITY BEHIND THAT BADGE😂😝💩👎🏻
BELLINGHAM IS CLASS
Ronaldo never left
cant be a Barcelona game without the referee on their side 😂
No one gonna talk about the horrible refs ?
Love Bellinghams shots , he passes the ball into the back of the net putting his foot thru it 🥶 dude is jus cold asf
Araujo vs camavinga was a clear penalty
Love Kroos to death but he didn’t look happy at all that Bellingham scored 🤦🏻‍♂️
Kroos didn’t look very happy
Bellingham is fantastic, but nearly half his goals are lucky tap ins
Futcrunch will make a new vid because his friend was ther
Bellingham is making Enzo more and more overpriced day by day 😂
All these “as a Barca fan” comments 🤣  Jude is good but there’s still a long way for him to go before he can be considered world class. We’ve all seen these one season wonders before. Only time will tell.
Greetings from the Bronx New York!
Great day for Bellingham, finally scored something aside from a tap in
i dont like Kepa, hes too small not very safe
Bayern vs Madrid UCL final 🔥🔥🔥
Imagine thinking gavi and Pedri are better than our English Prince, BELLINGHAM🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿👑🔥
Jude is a true Galactico
Thank you Bellingham but above all , thanks Mick Jagger !!!!
Isnt this guy a CM? He's a freakin world beater 🤯
JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA😂😂😂😂😂 Palancas FC
Jude Bellingham points this  legendary stats
The hate is this comment section is unreal. No its not 😁😁😁😁. Typical racist hooligans being themselvess 😁😁😁😁. Bellingham is going to drive them crazy 😁😁😁😁.
JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA!   THE FACES OF THE ROLLING STONES!!! JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA!!!!
Ian Darke and Mcmanaman are so unbearable to listen too, thank God for the Spanish commentary.
Rigged.
Jude Bellingham Tap in merchant
He’s not even in his prime yet he’s only 20 and carrying real on his back
This man is amazing
What you can't see in the highlights is that Gavi marked Bellingham out of the game except for two instances and those two instances were his two goals
"but but he only scores tap ins" 🤡 🤡
Bellingham taking lil boy gavi on a walk love to see it. Insane gavi ended the game without a yellow card (as usual). Im glad Jude beat those fags in Barcelona that’s what you get for being separatist rats
Amazing performance from Bellingham bit also think this game showed modric should start over Kroos
Bellingham and nkeitah both scored world class goals today
That was 100% a penalty for Camavinga
Imagine Santi gimenez in Madrid
With the caveat that I’m not a ref or a rule expert, that tackle in the box on Camavinga seemed like a foul to me
Modirc  accidentally   gave him more  than perfect ball .
Barca playing so dirty
An amazing spectacular performance from Belligham to win for Real Madrid!!!🇪🇸
Modric and Camavinga coming in on the 2nd half was game changing. And Joselu’s positioning helps Bellingham find more space. Great 2nd half !
What a player Jude Bellingham is!
BELLIGOL
Can you imagine if Jude Bellingham keeping improving keep scoring each and every games and then win the la liga title and championship title, this would be crazy I can see it happening
Motly his goals are 😅
A glorious game for Jude Bellingham.
Great game but unfortunately the commentators were very anticlimactic for such game. I know Ian Darke is a legend but his commentary with Steve McNanaman didn’t live up to the occasion of the game.
These two teams always deliver!
as a barcelona fan i just wanna say even with all the clowns saying el classico isnt the same its STILL the biggest match in league club football in the world even if one team doesnt have all their players healthy and are struggling in poor form the same people that say its not the same are still watching and still invested all the same
Jude Bellingham is a galáctico.
England finally has a super stat that can them the world cup
At this point I wish Jude Bellingham was on the Brazilian National team as copa america approaching Brazil need an answer
The last goal is a bit lucky
Where the Barca fans saying gavi>Bellingham? Also why does vini keep flopping? 😂
bad marking at the end
unlucky the game winner smh 🤦‍♂ 🤦‍♂
This kid is up there as the greatest of all time wow
It was zidane ronaldo and now Bellingham well done mate
People say he only scores against small clubs     I guess they were right💀🗣️
That shot form from Jude. Amazing.
Again again for them! 🤷🏽‍♂️🗣️ Jude f****** Bellingham!
Sometimes you wonder where rm would be without belli
FAKE VADRID sucksess is mainly talent from OUTSIDERS, LMFAO imagine taking pride in that as a vadrid fan..😭😕😜 WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME A PLAYER FROM FAKE VADRID FACTORY EVER SHINED ON THE FIRST TEAM😂😂😂
I think we know who is winning the next Ballon d'oro
Bellingham is him
This clásico is not the same all bored 🥱
Vinicius disappointing,
The ref saw the foul on vinijr and camavinga bro this ref got something going on that’s why barca always seems suspicious with their VAR 😂
His better then penaldo 😂
This boy is fantastic, at only 20? Wow!!!
Bellingham in this moment best player in Europe no joke ......
No Pedri, No Party.  Having said that, Barca did ok. Dominated the first half and were up 1-0 (and could easily have been 2-0).  The previous time these teams met, with Pedri and de Jong (and Bellingham) on the pitch, it was 3-0.
Barcelona are full of rats. Bunch of freaking rats. That was a penalty on camavinga. Clear as day. He had his man beat. If it was Barca it would have been called. Barca and their fans are nothing but rats.
Zinedine Bellingham
His Better and smarter than Gavi and Pedri combined
Mmbappe who?
If isagi doesn't score that last goal at some point I'm gonna be disappointed. That was a beautiful cross, assist, and first time shot. Incredible football.
0:48
Class
he’s basically farming now 😭
Bellingham is Ridiculous.
Hala Madrid!!
Pendogs be like: He’s generational 🤩🤩😂
As a die hard Madrid fan I must admit this is far from a good Madrid team, however unlike past squads this squad has goals!!**
He said he was ready for EL Classico and he definitely did not lie.
Never put romeu on the field again
Owned that small club. Broke Barcelona
6:36 Barcelona players asking for a foul when Gavi literally fell on his own 😂 sums up why they lost
How are these refs allowed to have that job?! How’s they get that job let’s be honest here. I want to become a ref. How the heck were those calls justified and where was VAR?! what is going on in football nowadays.
We not finna talk about modrics pass
jude goat 🐐
As a Birmingham City fan there is pretty much nothing to be happy about these days but seeing old boy Jude just killing it is some solace. Brilliant player.
Pinche golazo de JB5! 🔥
Hey Jude   Hala Madrid
Hala Madrid ❤❤
12:28 so far I like that he’s been a bit humble after scoring
Best soccer game Ive ever seen in my life
Juuuuude!!!!
Where are the Barca and Pessi meat suckers at
Fake vadrid got soo lucky with that last goal, typical vadrid this season scoring late desperate accidental tap ins…😭😂✌🏻👨🏻‍🍼
that barca sponsor is so ugly
Barca deep Throat the refs before the game and wasn’t enough for them to get the win Barca are a joke they can’t hang around the big dawgs no muts around here
I thought it would take Bellingham a year at least to really shine at Real, but he didnt skip a beat.
Jajjajaja que partido
Hala madrid Hijo de puta!!
Vardrid at it again with the refs, good victory ig
smellingham can't keep getting away with this
Carvahlo under appreciatd this game he made some crucial saves, camavainga, and modric made a huge difference after coming too let's also appreciate them❤
That should’ve been a free kick from that Carvajal foul
Barca has to be one of the worst clubs itw. Awful business, awful ball
😂
If madrid or england win anything soon, bellingham is in the balon dor conversation.
Barca so racist.
Xavi's reaction pretty much sums up the whole game! ⚽
I thought he was brought in as either a CAM or CDM or basically any MF role but bro decided to add replacing CR7 to his resume 😂
Bellingham joins the long line of players who stay at Dortmund just long enough until they are good enough to leave for a successful club.
Even Ronaldo didn’t have such a great start at Madrid. Bellinhgham 👏👏
Also let's appreciate camavinga and modric they made a huge difference after coming on.
of course of course of course of course, oh jude did you have to go and break our hearts
The fact that Jude is standing out in a team that was already a world class team in his first year is just a modern marvel 😢
9:28 😂 homeboy big mad wants to kill that lady right there
Bellingham and Camavinga thank you both
Modric did the pass messi did basically
Lol how was that tackle on Vini? Only way to stop him
NEXT TO THE DEFINITION OF HIM IS A PICTURE OF JUDE BELLINGHAM
As a real fan, Vini reminds me a lot of Neymar version of PSG. Just complaining or arguing.
i love jude belingham but the second goal he was offside
Y estoy es madrid 🫲🏼🤩🫱🏼
Jude scores a tap in: TAPINHAM, OVERRATED, overhyped, 🥱🥱  Haaland scores a tap in: A PROPER NO. 9, WORLD CLASS POSITIONAL AWARENESS, ALWAYS IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME😱😱
I might sound crazy to some people but Jude will be the best of all time.
Mick knew better than to celebrate. He knew Xavi & Co. will fock it up in the end.
This man Bellingham is truly the best player in the world right now. The form he’s in, he just can’t stop scoring. What a talent🙌🏾
Its rigged
Look say what ever you wanna say but how out of no where jude Bellingham gets good and why even tho he is a cm the put him as a stricker
Bellingham's shot remind you of anything?
Did anybody see oussifooty
Football has become a game where players can play bad for 90 minutes and then score a goal and be called man of the match and get the spotlight. -Karim Benzema
The speed of the ball, just rocket pass him, Said the commentator on Jude Bellingham, first goal 🚀🚀🚀😎
HALA MADRID
SIUUUU
hopefully we get musiala and mbappe next season
Really unfortunate for Barça. The post wasn't in their favor today.
Unlucky loss, 2 crossbars and we also didn’t take advantage of our chances
DAIM JUDE I SEEE YOUUU
This mans pretty much Alex hunter
Who said Real Madrid needs a good striker when we already have Jude,he has potential to achieve what Cr7 did for Real Madrid
😮
Real Madrid with an impressive away win. Bellingham puts in another big game performance.
This comentator is the most biased guy ever 😂😂 doesn't even react seeing the replay on the Camavinga CLEAR penalty. Such a joy to watch the Bellingham winner... 'Fortunate' 😂😂😂
Jude Bellingham’s football IQ is incredible; his anticipation is so brilliant, and his pocket awareness is top notch. A super star in the making
As a Liverpool fan I will never forget that we could of gotten Jude. Happy for him though, and wish him the best in his Madrid career.
Where are the barca/messi groupies at???😅
No Camp Nou? No problem for Real! Hopefully more wins to come for Madrid at this temporary stadium!⚪⚪⚪👏
Ballon d’Or, is calling Jude Bellingham🎉❤😊
REAL MADRID!!!! F YEAH!!! GOL GOL GOL
9:26 are they at the game?
Has been rock band sponsoring a has been football club
Jude is just.. just glad we signed him cause wow. Top of the table cause of him. Those substitutions Ancelotti made payed off especially Camavinga .
Barca fans can NEVER EVER say Bellingham is a tap in merchant. 🚀⚽
Finally a player worth the price
Come back against a team lacking almost half of the key players should be embarrassing ngl
As a Dortmund fan, it’s been beautiful to watch the careers of players like Bellingham and Haaland grow to what they are now. At BVB we all knew they were special, now I’m glad the World can see how special they are. 🖤💛
goaaaaaaaaaaat bellingham
JUDE is simply the BEST PLAYER in the World!!! Whoever says differently, is simply delusional 😂😂 ¡Hala MADRID! 💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
Doesn't feel the same without messi or Ronaldo 😊
Ossifooty on live tv
11:54 do you guys think modric meant that touch or he miscontrolled it, he checks his shoulder and sees the space too
Jude is that Dude!!!
That was a missile from Bellingham!
So many black player in RM
As a barca fan I’m pissed but Bellingham is HIM
We have found a new king after CR7 for Madrid. Right place at the right time always. Love Bellingham! ❤
Bruv, was i watching football or rugby🤣🤣🤣
The African blood moving that kid
Im a barca fan but Bellingham is the best signing made im not even gonna say we didn't have all out players barca had every chance to win but fair play to real madrid good job guys we'll see you next classico we'll get you back 👏
As a barca fan it’s unfortunate to have dropped the 3pts in the last minutes of a big game. Bellingham definitely has superstar qualities & displayed them. Good game but that one hurt fr
Blud is HIM👑👑

ok bellingham’s positioning is like prime ronaldo level right now 😭
Bellingham was just at the right place at the right time unfortunately for Barca
HEY JUDEEEE WHAT A SIGNING WHAT A PLAYER!! MOST IN FORM PLAYER ATM MIGHT AS WELL SAY THE BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW!!
Lol give him the ballon dor right now 😂…imagine wen he gets even more experience sheesh.
Bellingham is the 1st legitimate English superstar footballer. World class quality proven outside the over hyped english press and league. We could be seeing the 1st 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 balón d'or winner soon.
13- goals 13 games. That’s insane. Even having 10 goals in 13 games would’ve been impressive but that’s a 1-1 ratio I don’t think people realize how crazy that is. Especially for a cm that sometimes plays up but still
I think it’s time for Southgate to build the England team around Bellingham and Kane.  Those two are on fire in Europe.
BellingHamazing
Best player on earth
Wow he is at Frank Lampard level
Looking like a bargain at the moment!
Mike towers is the best at soccer
Bellingham modo dios.
BellinGreat!!!
Gundogan is a close top #2 clutch player glad to see them on the scoreboard !
You need to start your clinical finishers in this game.
L Real Madrid 😂
Wow this is amazing to this Bellingham’s performance wow 🔥🔥 good changes in the second half with Camavinga and Modric yes 🙌
This man is insane .
Bellingham🤯🔥🔥🔥🔥unsung heroes Modric, Camavinga and all game Carvajal🔥🔥🔥🔥
Justice in the end for Real Madrid. How the ref didn’t call that penalty against Araujo is mind blowing 🤯. Bellingham is quickly becoming the face of Real Madrid. Hala Madrid!
Barca Fumbled. Simple as that. They were complacent 2nd half  and were punished for it
What a pass by Luka lol
Jude is the game changer 🔥
I used to say Bellingham only scored tap in and didn’t decided matches, now I think he’s one of the worlds best if not the one right now
Last 2 LaLiga meetings Barca: 2-1 W with 92nd min goal Madrid: 2-1 W with 92nd min goal  I guess Jude had to return the favor
Bellingham is just amazing he is always at the right place ✍🏾
A clear Penalty at 78' for Real Madrid.
Stop giving away the game w these titles
Lord, what is that beautiful slow motion camera behind the goal!! glorious
Jude is 1000% just HIM.
He really is BellingHIM
Bro ter stegen tried punching the ball instead of saving it 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Unbelievable.
I told everyone Bellingham was the next big thing before the world cup.
Far post FFS.
Bellingham best player in the world
A nutmeg for the game winning goal🥜🤩
bellingham is playing false 9 he’s there striker when vini and rodrygo drift out wide he’s able to goal hang because of a elite midfield behind him
Weak challenge from Camavinga tho
Caramel Zidane saves the day again! Jude's filling everyone up with joy!
People who saw Oussi at the beginning❤ 👇🏻
We finally found a British player that isn’t overrated guys!
Judegoalingham
Goat Jude🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
BellingHIM 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️💯💯💯
Every goal scorer in this match played at Dortmund 💛🖤 lts great to see former players thriving!
Feran is so bad
OH MY GOSH WHAT A BOMB
Well is not just Mike I guess 😂😂😂😂😂
Cancelo at RW!?!?
Modric and Camavinga really changed the game
GOAT
Bellingham is definitely looking like a serious contender for the ballon dor
Sup wid that ref
I’m just glad Jude scored 2 on Barca. Barca fans been shitting on his name talking about “Tap ins” what a goal
JUDE BELLINGHAM LADIES AND GENTS 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
As a Barça fan I’m actually not disappointed with this game. We did very good compared to the other games we won by 1-0
Kross looks joules
Already full of drama in the first half!
Who saw oussi  👇
England will lift the World Cup in 2026 golden ball winner Bellingham 😤
9:27 Mick & Ronnie the only ones not impressed with their fellow countryman Bellingham's goal
This kid should wear the mythical 7 to honor Ronaldo
Is that really the Barcelona home shirt? It's disgusting 😂😂😂 what tf is that mouth design on the front? I see that it's the Rolling Stones logo, but why? They are bad luck now for losing to Real, the best club in the world⚪⚪⚪ Hala Madrid mofos
Bellingham is the best player in the world right now. Good for that young man!
Why do yall ruin the outcome in the title? Just post the highlight and you'll get more views
Love Bellingham and I’m a barca fan so it hurts to him being great against my team but phenomenal performance he’s gonna be tough to beat
That gundo goal is still class. Bellingham is a definition of cm/cam
Gaycelona smashed by the biggest football club of all time
Cr7 number 2 in real Madrid he's now. If referee were ok Real Madrid won 3. 1
Let’s go Madrid! Btw, Barcelona should join the NFL not the La Liga.
Romeu coming on slowed down the game too much for Barca and his numerous mistakes led to Madrid getting too many chances at the end. Barca also had way too many missed chances in front of goal.  In the end though, Bellingham is just too good!
Forget the summer, i would say for the past 7 years!!
Vini  Talks a lot  And also cries to much
11:20 …
Someone did the bicycle
Best player of La liga so far. He will hopefully keep having a great season in the League and Europe.👏👏👏
The Ref didn't accept the payment from Barca because it's hot right now!
Ancelotti is definitely not regretting spending all that money for JUDE!! World class signing, I hope he stays healthy the whole season.
this ref was on something today..
What are they feeding him over at Madrid.!?!? That Bellingham kid is a monster.
Barca fans wya?
Χωρίς μεσσι είστε για κλάματα 😂
Hero with no fear
A zaga do real uma mae né 😊
Xavi isn't a good coach
i swear im a Barça fan of anything but my gosh i love Jude Bellingham ❤
ballon D’or 🏆
Vinicius was terrible today
The future for Real Madrid looks so promising with Bellingham, Camavinga, and Valverde. Then you got Modric and Kroos leading the younger players. Rudiger is so solid in defense. plus all the other quality players. This is a golden time for Real Madrid
Bellingham is the best midfielder in the world at the moment.
i love him
So no one gonna talk about ferran Torres tackle
Hala Madrid   🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Hala Madrid! Golazo de Bellingham!!!
wow
These camera angles keep getting better and better
No penalty Cama and araujo
Everyone knew  Bellingham was a going to be a superstar, but he’s turning into a world eater and only going to get better.
Rodrygo should not start. He’s good coming off the bench
Toni Kroos didn’t celebrate cus he knows his spot is fine and being sold for that Saudi money lmfao WHAT A GREAT teammate he is smh
There’s no doubt now, Bellingham is top 5 rn
\           /   \(' - ')/
No one will talk about the video and camera improve in this highlights?
Like the commentator said, “run into the box, something might happened”.
Barca fans wanting to get down on Romeu, but he was doing a good job from when he came on until the 90th minute. Bellingham only needed two chances and he scored two goals.
Ter Stegen is the worst keeper I have ever seen, Barca will never be serious again until they get rid of that trash in goal.
Imagine hating on Bellingham 🤫🤫
bro is doing less crying now that he’s with RM
Reminds me of Ronaldo brace against barcelona in 2016 in supercopa espana.
Jude Bellingham is the best player in the world currently
Jude Bellingham really is HIM!
Is it just me or is Rodrygo been flopping really hard lately? I can’t recall the last time he scored or even created a play
RM fan here. For Barca, Xavi is class and been class. They’re playing with a young squad. For RM, Camavinga been an anchor. Bellingham, just speechless. Vini gotta stay strong on the ball, he gets legally pushed and they’re not calling that stuff. Rodrygo, gotta figure it out man
Yaya toure was doing the same thing for Man city as a midfielder. Bellingham is good but he isn't a striker Real Madrid need to have a good number 9 because Bellingham won't be scoring forever for the team as a Midfielder. He would have bad days coming too and the rest of team as to step up.
JUDEEEEEEEE
Bellingham is getting so lucky he’s going to flop
he’s literally living my dream…
He is HIM 😤🐐
It’s so impressive that Bellingham can “tap the ball in” from outside of the box 😂
Jey Jude!
Jude Bellingham a legend in the making.  Soon number XV CUP
6:43 did bro just do a nfl tackle on vini 💀
Is Barcelona a better team? They’re missing 5 of their starters, so a 1-2 win is that fair ?
Pffff
Jude is HIM OH MY GOD
Bellingham is the best in the world. Really just unreal.
Nah he still hasn’t done anything
Kroos gives me hater vibes
bellingham owns barca
All i can say is that we finally lost 🥱
Even though barça lost this just proves how much potential Bellingham has
Honestly Torres should have got a red just for being weird
Worst game in the season so far it was offside
So glad Madrid won
I'll just continue to love these clowns putting Musicans logos on their kit for them to get embarrassed with them on
Barca fan here. Bellingham was the biggest fear going into this game and it’s now obvious why. Romeu’s tracking back is lacking, not just in this game but overall. I wonder if MATS is losing a bit of his sharpness.
Great game from both teams! Very entertaining.
😯 the curse of Mick Jagger !? #
“only scores tap ins” salty barca fans are too funny 🤣
Cama came in for Mendy n changed the whole game. Carlo needs to stop experimenting with Mendy he’s not good. CAMA MUST START EVERY GAME NO MATTER WHERE IT IS WHETHER MID OR LEFT BACK HE MUST START. AND PLEASE TAKE VINI N RODRYGO OUT THE 9 POSITION THEYRE NOT BUILT FOR THAT
Bellingham is too soft. He should come off the  bench
Mbap... WHO???????? Bellingham SUUIIIIi!!!!!!!!!!!! ;)
Man these clasicos arent like before 😢 boring and not the same passion, names you dont even recognize, before even if you didnt watch soccer you knew the players somehow😢 good times
Nothing to say. When you have chances to lead 3-0 but make the two hit on posts, you know you will be punished for wasting chances in the world of football.
how in the world is that araujo challenge not a pen
Bellingham is him 💀
Bellingham is a gem of a signing.balon dor for sure. Madrid is much better with Camavinga on the field.
Tony Kroos is making Real Madrid play slow
I can’t believe this kid he is just phenomenal
Dont think nobody can ever take barca serious with someone like joao felix in their starting lineup ...It was just a matter of time before madrid took over the game .
6:42 ferran torres really wanted to hug vini there
Jude 🔥 💣 Hala Madrid hasta la muerte
0:12 OSUIIIII
I hate when the thumbnail has to be the winner, like let us watch normally to get excited 😢
Thank you Saint Jude
Madrid should pay another 100 mil to Dortmund.
It is amazing how Bellingham has scored more goals this season so far, than hazard across 4 seasons
11:54 Modrick 🤯
Rudiger telling Jude “again” hyping him up. 😂
Como siempre regalando goles en offside
Chromeo fans?
Bellingham has more talent in his right foot than all the Barcelona's midfield combined.
What a miss striker
Estadio pedorro como el equipo
Camera man 😂 she was a baddie
That’s right Xavi you ain’t trying to fight Vini Jr this time huh?
England have no excuses to win a trophy now
Bro imagine Bellingham at liverpool. We should have got him 😢
Barca got away with tooo many fouls man
Tap in merchant
Jude Bellingham>>> Barca 😂
as a barca fan that bell screamer was unexpected
Jude🫡🫡🫡
Great game Real Madrid 🤍🤍 and great win to Real Madrid 🤍🤍 I love Madrid 💖❤️
As usual Barcelona gets a lucky gol and this time the luck ran out, thanx JB for showing them haters how it’s done
Who can argue that Zidane or Cruyff was this good as a midfielder at 20 years old? Jude is officially Bellingham, the unbelievable!
You cannot question the greatness of this guy no matter who you support.
Hala Madrid ! An entertaining Clasico as usual. Bellingham is amazing and has exceeded my expectations. Barca played a solid game, it’s that Jude came up big at the right times.
Barca azul y rojo ❤️por siempre 🥰😁
Salvation is found in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ loves you all
haaalaaaaa maaaadriiiiidddd❤❤❤❤
let’s see pedri or gavi decide a game
Barca fans don’t need any more proof, Jude is a game changer
Camavinga deserves to start what a beast
That’s a pen, araujo didn’t get nowhere near the ball
6:50 can easily say any barca player wouldve started a fight here or done the most grande vini showing levels how it should be unfortunate they eventually got to him at the end
I’m a fan of vini but my god he loves to be a hindrance by constantly trying to confront someone
really absurd how barca in every classico gets away with literally tackling players nfl style and the least being warnings and yellows should be punished way more imo
Bellingham was 2 for 2. Gundogan is also a legendary midfielder. Barca missed too many shots.
"bellingham the Hero" already show Madrid win. the only objective to see a highligh is because you did not see the game and want to watched without know the result. who create this videos :(
Real Madrid are nothing without Jude if he wasn't leading the line we would be in 10th place or lower Jude, Tchoumeni, & Joselu are our impact player's this season the rest just can't keep up we almost blew it with our sorry defending
Worst barca team in 30 yrs or more
look at Kroos.
And I thought the Spotify logo was bad…
He’s just incredible. He is so unbelievably great for his age that it’s really something special to watch. Jude is the man. Jude is HIM.
This one hits even better because barca fans where talking about he only scores tap in trying to find a way to hate
Where the barca fans at who said he only scores tap ins 😂😂 or the super delulu’s who compares him to pedri
HD AF
As a Barca fan, I have to admit Bellingham has an AMAZING game
There can only ge one explanation: Bellingham is the real Superman
Crazy to think Madrid beat Barcelona with such trash officiating every time they play. Spanish refs never favor Madrid in El classico especially not this guy. So many obvious calls ignored by this ref.
Barca have themselves to be blamed
Barca got 👅’d
The albino in the beginning 🙂
Modric what a Pass!!!!!!!!
I'm not a RM fan but i like how they always find the right players. This Bellingham investment has very good signs of a good investment for the future. Relatively young team too.
What a player is Bellingham  HALA MADRID
Barca had more goal attempts 😢
what kind of lineup was that from Barca to start the game XD
I have no confidence in Kepa, too short and slower than Lunin
the commentator was wrong this is bellinghams first el clasico its his first clasico in spain but his first was in arlington
Fr
Fuc….lucky bastards
6:42 shocking tackle I've ever seen on my life lol
Bellingham can have my kids
0:12 OUSSI 😂
How is is a clásico if Madrid win it every time
As much as I love Real Madrid, Vinicius does cry a lot it's getting annoying, we have no more DAWGS left in the squad, only Rudiger
I wanted Barca to win this game but that boy bellingham showed that you have to make chances count , that and Barc took to many outside shots instead of playing in the box making goals like They should....
If Bellingham keeps it up...there will be no debate for next years Balon d Or
He’s already a legend for Los Blancos simply amazing !
Bellingham is unbelievable. 😀🎉.
Amazing Bellingham goals. Some of the tackles were embarrassing; they have no place in football.
I guess we don't need Mbappé😂😂😂 Bellingham is more than enough
What’s that YouTubers name at 00:13
AH LA MADRID!!!!
its incredible how Ferran didnt get a red for doing that mma tackle
9:00 GYAT
Should have done Calma calma celebration
At this point he’s gonna take that ballon d’Or 😂
Hala Madrid!!!
Ladies and gentleman, Jude Bellingham. That’s it.
Una bestia ese Bellingham.
La liga del florenboss, Bellingham es offside 😳 🤣 🤔 😐
As usual araujo emptied his pockets and found vini jr
Bellingham is the best player in the world
Cancelo was selling😂
Camavinga is essential in the midfield for Real Madrid because , he can defend and get the ball back to Real Madrid whenever they lose it.
Bellingham bout to have a great season
Rebotes bellingham😂😂😂
LET'S GO JUDE!!! 🎉 what an amazing game.
Mbappé is crying
Why does no one talk about how good Kepa has been lately!
Fermin has been hitting the post like crazy lately
jude is unreal
Not even Toni kross Well never score a goal like  that
And people still say Gavi is better than Jude
That Feran Torres foul gotta be more than just a yellow dude had a better tackle than the entire cowboys secondary 😂
Barca is done
I got him on dls and he score like this😂
Jesus loves you-!!
Jude at it again!!! Real Madrid to the 🌍🌏🌎!!
Petition to make Bellingham Brazilian
1st goal was a banger
Jude my Jude my my.
heartbroken from Barca in that game  😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥💔💔💔💔💔💔
Penalti de araujo a carnavinga
The dream for mbappe is gone. Its so mothe$$;’dukkdjing clear that madrid doesnt need him anymore.
Great hustle, you can see how tired he is during the final run and even while celebrating, but it paid off in the end!!!
This guy is on fire
Kroos could not believe Bellinghams goal… incredible
Greatness 🔥
I was reading his biography, Jude’s dad was also a prolific goal scorer - though in non professional leagues. Jude’s parents really did a fantastic job raising him and his brother up well.
Amazing signing and well done Carletto putting him at the right place in the Real squad…..Carletto has always had the sixth sense for where to place his midfielders and how to bring the absolute best out of them!
12:23 Rudiger: "Again, again for them"
I know most people are praising Bellingham and rightly so ,but how was that not a penalty when Camavinga was tackled in the box?
JUDE!
My bwoy RPRT with the goals 😂 12:02
He's just 20 years old.
9:10 ohhhhhhhhh hhhhhh😂😂
The second goal was offside!!
Hey Jude
that referee really tried with this barcelona team but he can only do so much lol
El Classico blowouts (history lesson):  1994 - BARCELONA     5 - 0   Real Madrid   playmaking midfielder of Barcelona - Michael Laudrup 1995 - REAL MADRID  5 - 0   Barcelona    playmaking midfielder of Real Madrid - Michael Laudrup
HALA MADRID. 🎉🎉🎉
Bellingham?? Is good player. Gündogan what are you doing??? Barcelona isn't Man City. Xavi isn't Guardiola.
Greatest club team on Earth..Madrid
Bellingham is him🔥
BETTER BALANCE THAN A ONE-LEGGED MAN STANDING IN A HAMMOCK!!
The “special” clasico jersey curse still continues
After watching that Beckham Docuseries, it feels like Bellingham is eerily similar when it comes to scoring in the big moments. We’re watching a future legend of the game
How was that not a foul on camavinga in the box lmao
Jude's second goal was nothing but an art.
Haaland will join January
Good job guys 🎉  Rodrigo should be out
Mbappe must be regretting not coming to Real Madrid … is he needed still ?
I'm a barca fan and I don't doubt Bellingham at all never have. I wish he came to barca 😭
Hala Madrid🤍💜🤍. So glad they acquired Jude!!!!
Madrid should try to spell l-u-c-k-y a few times to see if it sinks in.
Crazy thing is that he ain’t even a striker or anything
As a Barca fan it sucks that we had a couple chances to put the game away, two off the post. But this game is all about taking your chances. Jude is turning out to be a wonderful player at Real Madrid. He clearly is loving the pressure of that jersey. Congrats to real today.
Lol Barca really is shyttt so glad their fans could finally see how awful they are
As a Barca fan I knew Madrid had it in the bag. They are a stronger and better team specially with Bellingham, best signing since Ronaldo! Well deserved 🙏🏻
Barca fans crying in the corner 😂😂
The Real Madrid's defense was not in full confidence at all.
Mbappe on this team would be amazing.
I pray he wins the ballon’dor one day.
9:46 Ter stegen saves those 9/10 times. But the issue lies on Barca leaving pockets of space and relaxing too much. Bellingham also has a great strike but those should be easy saves for Ter stegen. Modrics touch is not intentional and it just happens to end in the perfect place for a goal for Bellingham. He did have great positioning for that goal but overall he wasn’t doing much. His only two shots were converted and they were also the only two goals. This game could’ve gone completely the other way. Madrid are very fortunate be playing an injured barca and inexperienced young players.
The only player with more goals than BELLINGHAM in the top EUROPEAN LEAGUES is SERHOU GUIRASSAY for STUTTGART in the BUNDESLIGA. This kid is absolutely insanely talented . Just add MBAPPE to LOS BLANCOS then MADRID is complete.
Bellingham is like Ronaldo being a midfielder in his early days except it’s at Real Madrid 😂
No te escucho xavi 😂
Jude Bellingham next year’s Ballom d’Or winner.
some midfielder players consider 13 goals a season as good.
Legend
where are all the varca fans now?
Bellingham is just to good
Hala Madrid!! 🇪🇸 ❤️
Camavinga completely changed the whole game
Gavi who? Yamal who?
JUDE ...HISTORY IN THE MAKING...EXCEPTIONAL PLAYER!!!  MVP!!
Worth every penny ! Jude the dude ! Hala Madrid
Toni Kroos looking jealous after that Bellingham worldie. He’s leaving this summer forsure.
Bellin Vini and Rodrygo are the new best attacking trio in the world
Hala Madrid y nada mas🤍
6:42 Man needs to be in WWE
Best signing from the summer. deserves ALL the hype
Wow
Will put again.  Birmingham was smart. Retiring number
Bellingham and Kane are tearing things apart would be nice to see a bayern vs Madrid championships league final 😢😊
Barcelona fell for Real Madrid trap when they let them score first 😂
Bellingham must be doing juju now
At the age of 20, he is the best player now no doubt
I’m a Real Madrid fan and I’ve already said it I’ll say it again Gavi has changed as a player and compared to last year he’s completely changed and he’s gotten way better more calm and collective but it is what it is . HALA MADRID!🏳️👑 JUDE ERES EL MEJOR JUGADOR DEL REAL MADRID! 👐🏼
I’m so proud of Bellingham
I’m glad Jude finally shut up his hater 😊
Gavi had very bad control this game, led to punishes.
Vinicius and rodrygo should give bellingham their checks at this point
English media after this: 😱😱😱😱😱
HALA MADRID 🤍🤍🤍
El nuevo papa de barcelona a llegado=belimghan
refs hate vini
Why get mbappe when you have bellingham?
Thank you camera man 0:43
No Barca fans anywhere 💀
How was that camavinga not a pen...
Mr. injury and mr. yellow card merchant aren’t at the level of Bellingham
Modric passing his torch to Bellingham
Toni Kros didn’t seem happy with the first goal
Robo y gracias al Árbitro
BELLINGHIM
We are so wasteful with our chances. The first half by us was amazing and we we crumbled in the second half. Madrid git themselves an absolute gem in Jude dude is a star
Jude single handedly carrying real Madrid is crazy.
Give me Bellingham before Hazard
Yo was that Oussi at 0:12
Bellingham is a machine! As a lakers fan
Real Madrid did not waist their money on Jude
Talking about luck … wow Bellingham is out of the world but the 2 shots hitting the post was just so unlucky
Not only is he world class as a playmaker/creator, always picking the right pass with patience, poise, and touch, but he understands how to attack as well, making the right runs, and scoring at a high rate too. what a player, real madrid won the summer with this signing. really living up to his price tag and the expectation all while under immense pressure. truly amazing.
Barcelona deserved to lose with that kit. That looked so dumb
VARdrid right now, they had the most biased ref in history more than the ref in the 2008/09 Champions league against Chelsea
Jude Bellingham is playing FIFA my career mode on easy
Real winning el Classico is just too iconic 😂
Clutchnaldo. Clutchingham.
Fantastic first goal by Bellingham! Vini is an embarrassment, game after game. Falling and crying constantly. Barca really missed Pedri and de Jong. Ian Darke needs to give the "Racist La Liga!" stuff a rest. Yeah, you're virtuous and woke, Ian. We get it already.
Barcelona got away with so many fouls. Madrid deserved this win
I miss la liga on bein sport. The commentators were top tier😢
Barcelona Champions 💪💯💯💯💯💯
Even with the refs help ( not calling fouls, allowing 6 additional minutes instead of 4) they couldn’t stop Madrid 😂
Even with the refs help ( not calling fouls, allowing 6 additional minutes instead of 4) they couldn’t stop Madrid 😂
Does Real Madrid really need mbappe? Since Jude is crazy good? I think haland instead, and if we get davis from bayer , dam will be unstoppable lol
Bellingham- Viva la madre que te parió 😍
Not gonna lie, as a Barcelona fan, you can’t help but admire Bellingham’s brilliance. They should call him “brilliant Bellingham.” Incredible signing for Madrid.  So unlucky for Barcelona to only get 1 goal tonight. Doesn’t reflect their performance at all.
Glad Bark-a fans have been as exposed when messi left as a one trick pony
All I gotta say is BELLINGOAT     🫲🏼😮🫱🏼
Wow. Literally couldn't have had higher expectations and couldn't have exceeded those expectations in a bettwr way! Literally best possible dream outcome for Jude and RM!
Rodrygo needs to be benched
" Hes not even a striker" 12:01
What a play, Golden boy Gavi assisting Jude Bellingham. Pure class.
Jude B should take the number 10 after modric. Fantastic player
Bellingham > Beckham
Quick upload huh. Trying to make a million views by tonight I see lol
The graphics on this looks like a computer game. Wow!
JUDE BELLINGHAM 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Bruv every team needs an Antonio Rudiger... hyping Bellingham up at the end "One more time for them !"
I'm a barca boy but Bellingham is a demon, so like, can't even really be mad. Barca lost to Bellingham today, and really only Bellingham, but that says a lot to what Bellingham is capable of. Good W Madrid.
No words for Jude 🐐
One thing can be said about this match.. You can't be barca coach if you are scared to death of own tactical ability, lack of trust into your team, and pass it all on to your young players who you refuse to develop and leave them to figure it all out on their own. That's it⚽barca must play football and not try to play like west ham united for example.
People keep saying Bellingham is a tap in player. He’s scored multiple goals from a decent range and he’s just a midfielder, who needs Mbappe now?
Jude Bellingham is too good. If he continues what he is doing he will win the league
Am a Madrid fan but am Sorry at this point Vini is getting annoying he just be crying to much and fall so easily giving the ball away 😡 😡
no way barca lost with refs helping them all game 😂😂😂
Modric is just a classic player... The touch for the second goal was not a mistake, it was intentional as a pass... Bellingham read  into it in the buildup....So Classic
W camera man, 45 seconds in
Better than Zidane idc
This game could’ve gone either way. The first half was pure domination by barca. Reals first shot on target was in the second half and a little after the second barca started to wind down their intensity and were allowing too much space for real. Gavi would’ve ended the man of the match had this game gone the way it did in the first. It seems more of a disappointing loss for barca than a great win for Madrid. It just shows to not leave any crumbs for Madrid because they’ll take advantage.
How was that not a penality for Cama on Arujo??  can anyone try to explains it to me?
Was that not a penalty on Camavinga?
I just wish Barca didn’t have all those huge injuries  Game could have been different  But congrats to Real Madrid and Bellingham
Que es eso, xavi poniendo ese cuadro
We are witnessing the beginning of a future legend’s career, don’t take it for granted people 👏
bellingham is world class.
Kroos cannot play in this diamond formation. Especially against the bigger teams.
Him
So lucky. Modric tried to bring down the ball and it just happened to bounce there. Barcelona couldn’t finish their chances. Madrid has been fortunate this season with results but it won’t last over 38 games.
All Real Madrid fans don’t realize they have a new MR.TAPIN
13 games 13 goals 3 assist   All this by being a midfielder this guys is a machine
bro carries the squad by scoring tap ins.
Best player in the world rn
I remember when Barca fans said Jude Bellingham only scores against small teams, I think they’re right!
araujo looks like a great defender because he’s allowed to make challenges like he did in today’s game without having to worry about giving away a pen
Bellingham is making me hate FSG the Liverpool owners even more. His first preference was Liverpool and they did conclude the deal we were favourites for because they found his wage demand too much. They didn’t want a young player with the same salary as Salah. This is the 4th time FSG have let world class players slip through their fingers due to cheapness if you look at Tchounami, Camavinga and Mbappe, where they had a contract agreed but the Americans thought 60 million for a teenager was too much and pulled out of the deal. Americans know the cost of everything and the value nothing.
These refs were probably paid for by Barca too, there were multiple MMA style takedowns this match
Why have your highlights been 360p only? 😂
can we all agree that he's a striker? he was locked up all game when he was in the midfield
Wonder how hazard is feeling rite now
heyyyy judeeee
Incredible! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Jude!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jesus Christ loves you
🔔 + 🍖 = 🐐
Did anyone else cry of joy when Bellingham scored?😅
goalie error and an unbelievably lucky tap-in goal after barca dominated the whole match. im still not convinced
Barca played great just couldn't finish those chances. Madrid with an amazing comeback, full credit to Bellingham. Man is always there everytime madrid needs a goal.
360p video quality!! Come on ESPN FC! You can do better than this!🙄🙄
What a banger
Mbappe is the GOAT.
Bellingham having one wonder season..that's all, nothing more
All goals from their new signings. Great match
Barcelona Fans can finally shut up about the 3-0 preseason game
2024 ballon dor should go to bellingham
😅😅 suck it VARsa, suck it Mick Jagger. Hala Madrid y nada más!!!! And yeah, Beatles>Stones
wow just wow
Barca fan here: Defense fault for not pressing both goals and just watching the ball
Vamos Madrid.  Barcelona this season has had trouble beating teams. Usually they win games in the final minute. Today with a superior team didn’t happen. Experience will always beat young inexperienced players.
Players are considered world class with stats like Jude's at the end of the season, this is literally madness. 13 games, 13 goals and 3 assists. Still many games to go. A 100 mil signing actually living up to the price
He only scores tap-ins!!!!!!! Hala Madrid!!!
Lucky goal though
This Barcelona team has very good youngsters but there are lot of flaws as well. Real Madrid is not perfect either and I won't be surprised if Atletico wins La Liga this season. I don't expect this Barcelona team to go that far in CL either but they have some future stars like Yamal, Gavi, etc.
No comment bye bye Bellingham
The fact that Modric is always in the comebacks is insane
What a dude! A Jude
The problem with Barca is that they don't give their players good criticism; Barca cannot build a player up; they take away players' footballing talent and make them an aimless passer. I have observed that every time a player leaves Barca for another club, they play their best football, but when a great player in another club joins Barca, they become a shitty player. This only happens to Barca. Barca players' footballing IQ is really low. The problem with Barca is not the players; it is the whole club footballing MO; it has become shitty; It was like they just want to pass the ball around and hope the time runs out quickly till final whistle. It was obvious from the first 20 mins they were going to lose this game (even when they were leading).
Overall Barcelona had a better game. Unlucky. 2nd half was not so great. Jude has been astonishing
😡
Jude is special. Stay healthy!
Bellingham came out from a video game! 🔥 What a player!!!
No bribery no win  Hala Madrid 🔥
what a real madrid midfield 👌
Barca paying the referee didn't work out well for them! Their "star" lamine yamal was just avg. at best today
Real Madrid ability to control the ball and having awareness of the field needs to improve. Their defense is selling and here I thought what they needed was a striker. Either sign a defender or put sum crucial words into the players so that they can know what's expected of them.
He might be better than toni kroos and ozil
There we go again… JB 🔥
As a city fan it was nice to see gundogan performing
Very disappointing from a Barcelona perspective. Cannot wait for a fully fit team.
Ok, was that Mick Jagger in the stands after the first Bellingham goal?
Why is it 360p only.
Mixed martial arts lol😂😂😂
Thank you for your contributions Englishman! You are carrying our club! You are already a legend for us!
Torres thought he was playing for the cowboys.
What the heck is this sponsor on Barcelona’s shirt?! 😂
Hey jude, where is jude? Here is jude, you asked
who else? its only bellingham, im tellling you, this man is COOKING. been here for 4 months and he's already a rma legend.
gotta bench rodrygo atp
Who is this Jude guy?
Bellingham is Real Madrid  best  signing  over summer  , who agree  ????  🔥 🔥  🔥
Farca exposed and their bandwagon disappears.  All's right with the world.
Barca should have won but the post was madrid’s man of the match for sure 😂😂😂 Jude is really something insane and vinicius did nothing but cry and lay on the floor all game. What a game ❤
Acknowledge HIm !!!
Rudigar funny talking ab do the celebration again 😂😂 what a lad @12:25
Hats off to Jude, always at the right place making the right plays. We missed our chances and got burned, I hope this lose will not put the end to the title race this season. We will be back with our fully fit squad for next Classico.
I’m done watching this rigged circus Real Madrid can’t even win without some bullcrap call or goal l
So many cry babies in the comments 😂
From an actual Barcelona fan and someone who hates Real Madrid I am not even mad. Bellingham is a complete monster. Real Madrid can suck it but good games
Araujo made an NFL tackle without ever playing the ball in the box on Camavinga. Also Rodrygo could’ve easily dinked that ball over to Vini when they were on the breakaway..   Despite being “dominated” by Barca (according to the pundits), it could’ve easily been 4-1 Real today..  Hala Madrid!!
A bit special isn’t he this lad? He can bring us glory!
Balon d or for next year.
Unreal the I have them winning the UCL and the torch will be passed
But remember guys Pedri and Gavi are better than Jude 🤡
360 P is rediculous
That stadium went completely quiet after he scored the game winner.
Torres giving vini the Messi treatment was absolutely it😂 quite hilarious
“Tappingham” they said. “Should’ve gone to the Premier League” they said.  Jude Bellingham is not just world class. Jude Bellingham is the best player in the world. He is going to win the Ballon d’Or very soon. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿⭐️
On what planet is this not a pen?  11:11
They should just keep Bellingham put him as forward and forget about mbappe
Jude showing BARCELONA where they belong. BARCELONA IS TRASH
I don’t want to hear nothing from Barca fans. Real Madrid played horrible for most of the game, and Barca still couldn’t capitalize. HALA MADRID Y NADA MAS 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
This guy is 20 years old. Wow.
Na na naaaaaaaa na na naaaaaaaaa Hey Jude !!!!!
Great game.... but lets not forget how ESPN uploaded this video with only 360p max... cmon now
Bellingham is unbelievable.. What a signing …
At 20 years old is crazy
Bellingham is the best player in the world right now and will be a future legend of England and of his club. He’s already making history, what a special player. Also, Camavinga deserves to start, he completely changed the game today. And Valverde has been world class so far this season, absolute engine, never gets tired, looks like he can run forever. Hala Madrid! 🤍
JUDE BellingHIM. Bro this guy is gonna be an icon mark my words. 🔥
insane 1st goal tap in for jude
It not mad that we lost the game even tho we played better im mad because Barça is getting disrespected even tho they put a fight with a bad midfield line, respect the club atleast if they put a good fight with their struggles
Unlucky Barcelona with all those injuries and I am glade the scores was only 1-2
I thought steve was mike bisping for a little 😂 they sound super alike
Ref is a f(ck8ng dumb@Ss where is offside
Xavi’s reaction to Real’s second goal says it all.
Yeah, the goooood ole 360p!
The comments are hurting my eyes😢😢to tears. Please stop it before someone says he’s the 🐐. At that point I will new glasses lol.
Vinnie played so horribly, more surprising than Bellingham performance to me😂
Como siempre favoreciendo al Real Madrid claro penal sobre Araujo una verdadera lástima los árbitros
Bellingham is currently the most in form player in the WORLD
People blaming barca of paying the refs yet madrid literally getting every call in their favor and being helped out to win🤦🏽‍♂️ it surprises me how stupid madridiots are
These Clasicos are not like they used to be. Even the camera work is subpar. The field looks subpar. There’s no excitement behind these Clasicos anymore. Jude did great btw happy for him!
Just wait until Jude starts playing bad and all these fans will turn against him always happens with these young ballers
Vinicius is the reason many people hates him, he complains a lot. And i like the guy
A lot of comments about "overrated" Bellingham just went like bad milk I reckon.
Jude "The Main Character" Bellingham
Jude top 5
THE ROLLING STONES FACE SAYS IT ALL. HEY JUDEEEE
Bellingham my God!
Poor Barca, even with 3 men up they couldn't get it done. Pathetic 🤢
Barca had all the chances in the world to win by 4 goals, but Barca did what they have been doing un the last 2 years
how do we have var and million dollar players but record on 360p camera.......
No mames
Vinicius Jr, go silent all game, provoke Home fan, and if home fan insults him come to media and play victim card
Bellingham and Camavinga absolute game changers man
Espn sucks
Hopefully he becomes a Madrid legend like Ronaldo. Already on that path 🫡
So we lost because of? US! I wonder if Xavi trains our guys to shoot from afar. And it shows that we really need FDJ and Pedri.   Last note: that last minute provocation from certain someone should motivate us to win the segond leg.
Real didn’t pay Bellingham 😍😍😍
Te amo Jude ❤
Real Madrid basically got Zidane again… unreal
Real Madrid are the Greatest 🥶
Who needs Mbappe they got Jude Bellingham
Bellingham is ballin' right now. This coming from a Barça fan. He is the real deal!! This was the best signing all summer!!
No pedri no de Jong no koundé I expected this result but barca stil played really well
Real Madrid needs a LB so desperately. Mendy is useless.. and ofc a striker.. hopefully Perez delivers Davies and Mbappe this summer. Hala madrid. Love you Jude
HE’S HIM
He’s going to be the best midfielder of all time
Hala Madrid!
Alaba, what happened to him?
Brah if that was Messi they would've call that penalty
Daddy Madrid always delivers on Saturdays
Jude is better now,real player
Those who saw OussiFooty at 0:14
COMEBACK JUDE
Hala Madrid⚪️⚪️⚪️
If he continue like this,  he will be a legend .👑🔥
OMG. THIS JUDE IS NOT NORMAL
I wonder why Vini provoke Barca fan at the end  He always center with controversional moment  Thoughts?
VAMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOS
He made a nice goal
Jude 🇪🇸🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 👑🏆 this is like Newcastle Liverpool all over again 1st 1-0 2nd 1-2 🤣😂
Bellingham’s luck and awareness is unbelievable! Great signing by Madrid. Enjoy the win, we will be back at your stadium fully fit and ready  Edit: just to be clear(since Madrid fans are dumb asf) having luck isn’t a bad thing, it’s actually very good. With that being said, it’s not an insult since I wouldn’t mind if Barca players had this kind of luck too.  Bellingham was good, but modric and camavinga changed the game, and Madrid deserved the victory.
Torres should’ve got red card
This is where legends are made! Jude proving time and time again he is up for the challenge.
Atletico can go up in third place and tied with 28 point with a game in hand
Incredible how Jude is now the biggest superstar in La Liga!   Nothing compare to this kid!
🐚 CONCHALONA 🐚
Yay all the team have loses now
Ballon dor 2024 winner
Real Madrid is the best 🔥🔥🔥
Nah Bellingham different 🐐
Wow Bellingham🔥
Like all English players the day he cant score they will want him to be fluent in Spanish
Barca really played out of this world in the 1st half just to choke in the 2nd 😂
🤢🤢🤮What a waste of english one-in-generation great players coached by clueless Southgate🤢🤢🤮What has the corrupt FA been doing to English football is not less than preemptive criminal act🤏
why are almost all the highlights posted on ESPN are in 360p at this day & age??
What is up with Spaniards putting their hands on Vinis face smh
That's happens when Mike Jagger support a team the team loses men
Bellingham on top of the world
I’m a Barcelona fan but man this Bellingham guy is electric. Can’t wait for Yamal to grow up 🔥.
Barcelona sitting back like the rats 🐀 that  they are 🤦‍♂️ what happened to tiki taka 😂.
Bellingham is AWESOME he really saved us this game my goat😭🔥🔥🔥
Jude Bellingham won that game himself as a team.
Emotions in the moment don’t lie. Did u see the faces of Barcelona players when Jude scored 1st goal. 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
13 matches 13 goals 3 assists 😅.. he’s d definition of Money well spent.. Infact we got him for cheap.. he deserves more bonuses…Jude Bellingham 👑
Romeu should not play in any big games … just dreadfully awful
Yeah the boy is a beast never doubted him good win for Madrid its going to be a big mountain to climb now for us
Hala Madrid⚪️⚪️
HE COOKED 👨‍🍳👨‍🍳
Realistically he got lucky today. We shouldn’t have let him score those. Still the biggest fugazi in recent sports history, he’ll be exposed soon enough.
I wanted Barcelona to win come on fifa 🙄😡
This was the ending of an El Clasico every Real Madrid was DREAMING about. A Jude Bellingham SCREAMER and then a Jude Bellingham WINNER to beat Barcelona at their own stadium. 😍🤍
All hail St. Jude! 👏  ¡Hala Madrid! 🤴
Bellingham hit em with the iconic Jordan tongue before scoring lol. The hype with this kid is real man.
This is what Mbappe could’ve been. Yet for some reason he wants to stay in Oil Club FC.
BELLIGOL BELLIGOL BELLIGOL
Whaaaat
And people still think Pedri or Gavi are better than Bellingham😂😂🤡🤡🤡
Im surprised my team won Bru 😮‍💨
Gavi pocketing Bellingham and Vini😂
Ballon d'or
Was the ref blind the whole game?
So happy for Bellingham he showed those racist Barca Tebas babies that a black man owns Elclasico❤🔥
Refs blind
First Bellingham goal is a tap in (joke)
Now that’s what I’m talking about! We all know who the best club in Spain is and they’re called Los Blancos. Barca got off to a good start but that’s not enough to stop the best club in the world. Jude Bellingham puts on a world class performance in his first El Classico match. I’ve said it once I’ll say it again Bellingham IS the best player in Europe right now! This young man is a freakin beast!  Barca I’ll give you credit for the fast start and hanging around despite the injuries but regardless your first defeat of the season goes to your bitter rival. There’s a difference between playing us in a exhibition match vs playing us in a La Liga match. Real Madrid remains at the top of La Liga, HalaMadrid!!!👑💪🏽

Can’t believe people are still doubting Bellingham. Best singing of the summer. No debate anymore.
Bellingham giving Madrid the win even though he ghosted in the first half 😂😂😂😮
It’s very impressive how Real Madrid managed to beat Barcelona with a biased referee! Perfect no more. Hala Madrid 😍 Edit: I think I started world war lll in the replies Edit 2: And to the people in the replies saying “Gil Manzano is a madridista”, reminisce Real Madrid vs. Valencia, then keep telling me that.
Bellingham crazy 😂 I‘m so glad Real Madrid bought him 🫶🏻
Fantastic second half performance and Bellingham rising on the occasion and justifying his price tag even more. Massive result for the title race. Onto the next game 💪🏾
I knew we were gonna lose the second they announced The Rolling Stones kit lmao

Bellingham was aghast the whole game accept for 2 moments his goals and was pocketed the whole game except for 1 moment his 1st goal, Bellingham was lucky, and Barça played a much better game. Visca Barça y Visca Catalunya.
