Lovely aircraft but Will, seriously, you’re flying first class and wearing ripped up skinny jeans?? My husband says have some respect and dress appropriately.
I just saw you in a whole room on a plane. This is no first class ...
Why do you have so much on board luggae?
10:32 did u even hire a camera man
As an oder Australian man I shall not comment on the "Pommy" chap who ( in torn jeans) dares to board a first class flight to the U.K. He has no manners.  Over the last 45 years we have flown to Europe and always dressed (comfortably) for the occasion!. I don't know what has come over the average traveller as the flight is part of the holiday.
Yooooo
Fun fact: sydney is the 2nd biggest aurport in australia
This video feels so humiliating as I always travel in economy where people fight over who gonna get first served 😂
I dont get these prices. If I check a simple business ticket from Mexico to Amsterdam it's 6000 €. This man flies first class all over the world for similar prices.
I sor you in the airport this is the first time of me watching you I sor you
Thank you for your gentleness. Always so nice to travel with you. If you can find a day where there is no strike going on, why not trying... AIR FRANCE. My of my best friend is working on that company.
I love the fact that you do 5 different currencies, including Canadian. Did you start your videos with just the £, being from the UK, or have you always done the 5 currencies?
that was hella mid ngl
You say it’s A$10,000 for 1st Class. I have just paid the equivalent ofA$13,500 for a Qantas business class seat . (July 2025)
The First class Lounge is great. The Quantas experience is ....."La Cringe" !
Is this the Australian cringe ?. Please look at Emirates first class transportation. There is no comparison. Ned Kelly is dead. This is the 20250!
N
Mate what type of Tims are you running there? Need to get a pair….
You didnt really show the seating area well.  Is there any privacy door between seating ?
Seeing this flight used to stop in Pakistan, India, Egypt is just incredible. You really made good use of your stop in Singapore. Buying duty free chocolate for yourself and Millie, hope she liked them.
How do you video 😅
I'm Australian. I flew Qantas once long haul, NEVER AGAIN. RUDEST HOSTESSES EVER. now I fly Emirates, Singapore or Etihad Airlines
Qantas first is no better than Emirates business.  Oh, well.
The huge window blocking wall is ridiculous. Why do so many airlines do this???? 😮
Its crazy how the rich can travel all the time.
Witch insta360 are you using?
NZ to london is a tad longer,  this is my usual route !!
Yooo 🤘 😊❤❤❤❤❤
Imagine being able to take first class flights and complaining that the menu is flimsy. You pompous ass
This guy sucks so bad
Why aren't you using your own, electric, preferably sonic, toothbrush?  Even the cheapest electric toothbrush brushes more effectively than any manual toothbrush.
Where u get money 4 dis ?..?
The lack of privacy is pretty lame
Nobody calls them ‘Tims’. Just speak normally 😂
this is what happenes in my dreams
only for people who can afford it , otherwise go business class.
The only thing better than other airlines is the flight crew.
$10K one way?
why such a vast  price difference Qantas ?
Naff jeans knee splits. Retro rubbish. Not impressive.
Flew Melbourne/Singapore/London Business Class Qantas but my seat wouldn’t recline so was upgraded from Business to First Singapore to London.   Epic.
No shower on the Qa380??
Why do you always have the same Nasa hoody on?
If you are in the position of needing assistance, like a wheel chair when you pull up.  Don't go to australia!  They do not have porters as we do in the USA.  You are on your own!
Painfully average for first class. Would much rather fly Qatar or Singapore Airways in Business.
Are you sponsored by NASA?
Another youtuber did the experimental flight from Sydney to either London or New York (I believe New York) where it was a direct flight. The flight attendants revealed in the video that the tea is used to help people fall asleep to prevent jet lag and timezone issues as much as possible
1:15 what is that 747 doing in the background rare find
Is the cost in AUD?
I’ll never get over the poop river in London
heh seems like there was a TrekTrendy bingo
If i was paying i would never choose Qantas first. Emirates, ethihad or qatar or singapore are mlles better. There is very. Little to differentiate the in air experience between Qantas first and bus....other than the fare. Qantas first for $10000?  Its often double to triple that
Tip to every traveller. To buy tim tams buy them at woolworths or coles. A family pack is cheaper and is 1.5 packs.  Much cheaper than a "duty free" pack made to gouge tourists.
Vegemite is strong to us aussies too. Its a little bit with lots of butter. 😊
How the hell can this guy afford $10000
Can u do more  premium economy , I don't think most of us can afford first class.
$15,000 will get you a stunning cabin on a luxury cruise to the same destination albeit slightly slower. 😆
Wow, good job. You actually managed to make Qantas look good.
$10,000 dollars? - Peanuts. The cost of a first-class suite on RMS Titanic for the 5 days crossing to New York in todays money was $50,000 - $100,000 dependant on size of suite. Now that was a time to enjoy, forget all the quips and inappropriate banter as regards the sinking, that will surely follow this comment.
DC, diet coke, 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
Yum - barbecue sauce by Neil Perry!!! He has supervised the Qantas first class menus for years.
Ow do I get your job 😀😀
This is one "I wish" wish list's 😆 🤣 😂 😹
The cost is incredible. I paid less than that for my new Daiken 6HP (whole home) Air Conditioner replacing a similar unit installed in 98. I guess its relative. If you can afford it or accrue the points miles go ahead!
I live in Australia and will never use Qantas again following their behavior over Covid, their treatment of staff, taking money off customers for flights that never existed.
This is so removed  far from reality. I fear for Humanity- Hard pass. Dont forget - good times make soft men. Hard times make good men - fly economy and do something useful with the extra money.
Man if you pay over $10K for a first class seat, you would expect the remote to work as expected! hahaha they will have to charge $1K more to replace the batteries in these remotes maybe?
I believe on Emirates first class. There's dine on demand meaning you can eat as much food as you want.
6:14 How do you use the camera to see outside the plane
having caviar on a plane is normal for him? its funny how picky he is about some really small things
Qantas is Crap Bro, avoid it
I fly qantas so often. I have always been in economy, and was very happy with the experience. I will not be so impressed anymore. Amazing vid
Thanks!
9:09 Jeffy: Daddy, you know I hate green beans on a plane!  Mario: JEFFY EAT YOUR GREEN BEANS ON THE QANTAS FLIGHT OR YOU’RE GROUNDED!
Smart move having the trackies handy for the longer journey
I always! Only ever fly 1st on all my long hauls
Dude,whats up with this stupid hoody from fake ass nasa
There is so much of this that looks crappy and sub par compared to other similarly priced first class tickets from other airlines.
What a waste of money!
Dude, that beef was nowhere near medium rare….
Qantas is my all time favourite company of plane. And the plane being the A380. Great video will.
Pity the honey didn’t come from Kangaroo Island as that is where the purest bees in the world are, but as it’s South Australian anyway should be delicious
Is this an ad?
vegemite is a sin against god and you know it
mate your you tube stuff allows you to get free fights correct
Put another shrimp on the barbie
How does he have his own passport
recently went Economy on MEL-SIN as a Gold Member and Silver, my travel person and I could not believe how bad the customer service on the plane has gotten from the last time we traveled Qantas (2023 in November) On our return trip with Emirates we were absolutely shocked by how good the customer service was on there and even offering us special food bc we were Gold, overall next time we fly we are going Singapore Airways
You love Vegemite. I love you
Who spends $10k+ on a 24 hour period of anything? I just don’t understand people’s infatuations with status and appearances.
Sorry Qantas has lost its way. Very sad to see
1st class is wasted on someone whose drink of choice is coca cola
this route annoys me so much   the Q in qantas stands for Queensland, a state that is better served by EK for london route than QF   secondly, with the syd-per-lhr, SYD has the an extra service   but more annoyingly for those living in any of the other major states, Qantas does a poor service of allowing people to join this flight   all of the flights into SIN, are timed so there is long waits in SIN if you wanted to catch it  so qantas's own website will push you on to the ex syd flight (and in this country, I think going from dom to int, sydney is the worse airport to do so
Cool
Qantas…the armpit of airlines.
Never flew Quantas or for 24 hours for that matter. Did fly Turkish airlines on their newer Business class for 16 hours and it was absolutely amazing.
Acceptable mate. Enjoy mane
This is soo cringe and looks like one of the worst 1st class services and seats I’ve seen 🤣
As an Australian whom flies frequently Qantas is a terrible airline hated by all the locals.
SO boring
I don’t think I should watch. I am about to do the same trip today on QF1 - Business. So I think I need to enjoy that without feeling jealous of those further up the front 😉
You should subtitle this video "Shoving Things In My Mouth Throughout The Trip In Slow Motion '
Air bridge …
Mate this is a load of bollocks this is business clas at best.
Qantas 1st class is very disappointing. You're much better off in business class.
Shower and then put clothes on you've already worn for at least 11hrs. And then put them back on after another 14hrs. Gross
The food service looks subpar compared to how much you're spending
Maybe in my next life I'll be reborn as an Aussie.

I would love to do that... But I'm broke lol
Renner Squares
Great video, attention to detail amazing but the product Qantas first class is underwhelming, no privacy at all.. service looks great though
The seared tuna sounds amazing
LOL TREK SPONSORING A MALWARE BROWSER. STOP SPONSORING MALWARE!!!!!! PLEASE!
tough life bruv
Hej jag heter Nils och jag älskar dig
Hello my namn is Nils and i like you very much
Loved watchinng this one - (especially as an Australian)! Well done!🎖🎖🎖😎😎😎🌟🌟🌟 But………Vegemite does not taste like Marmite!😊😊😊
I just cant believe you are going in first class with those awful clothes especially the jeans.  It is actually quite disrespectful of the airline and staff.
Between steak and caviar and a nice glass bottle of krug you can't go wrong @Trektrendy
if u r gonna book another first class, make sure to book me one too ❤
Will, why is marmite a thing??? Ugh! By the way, if you visit Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, you'll need a guide for our famous cheesesteaks. Hit me up.
I travelled Qantas all my life, even when they were more expensive. I now travel with any other carrier
I would go for the beef fillet.   I’m an avgeek, so I love watching your content.
❤ YA ,  NELLY  AUSSIE MATE,  If U like and eat VEGEMITE 😊🥰❤️‍🔥💫💥💜💙
❤
Half size door for first class suite, hard pass
I remember flying LAX-SYD it was a 22.5hr non-stop...
$10.4 thousand - and you get a Tea Bag??? Someone's laughing all the way to the bank!
אתה טס במחלקה ראשונה עם כל הפוזה אבל נראה כמו ערס עם הג'ינס הקרוע... קצת קלאסה לא תזיק...😔
Bro is thay YOUTUBE in ur comment section
"A can of DC" and "seat 3 Alpha"? Could this guy be more ridiculous?
Got 24 seconds in and switched off. A bit sick of travel videos watching people flying in first class. $10K. Seriously? It's not even jealousy. It's just irrelevant to my life.
For $10K the food menu is very ordinary versus what you get with other airlines
glad you love the vegemite!
Omg this looks miles better than emerats
Haha compared to other airelines this first class looks like exactly where it came from. A villiage. Australia is sooo behind in everything.
wow $10k flight well why not enjoy it not everyone can afford this not sure I like to let go this amount money quants not as good now for this I want a shower also boring our food aussie chef is a flight attendant been singapore shower thats awesome not sure hey lag I never got it in first class Singapore Airlines before was great
Such nice quality! Hope you get to a million subscribers! (At time of writing it is 999K subs)
999K!
I was lucky enough to fly business on emirates from London to Melbourne and honestly business seemed better than your first class on qantas
NOTICED, WHENever   you're  travelling  in OZ ,  you;re  always  hitting  the plonk... Good on ya  mate.
it's worth paying   extra   for   FLYING   SAFELY>
The menu is probably light because everything on the plane adds to the weight of the plane.  Makes a lot of sense to me.
Is that Eddie Jordan just chilling in the lounge at the beginning also.
Why visit Australia is so expensive ..to visit ..have a great trip
I love your journeys but you take me back making me think that you sound just like Robin Leach. Champagne wishes and caviar dreams. Fits within the first class!!
Your vids suck that’s what I’d go for.
Over sized people struggle
wait so I should travel to NZ first, then fly to SYD > LONDON so save $5K?
On Emirates
Me Ho To 🇦🇪To 🇮🇳
How is this all financed? Sponsored by the airlines or paid with FF miles?
Shame you dress like a homeless person. Surely you could do a little better and still be comfortable
Noooooo.... #10.000 for first class??? No way, I paid $12.000 emirates last year businness
The thing on long haul flights I don’t like is them serving you food and drinks all the time and at random hours
Wearing a hoodie in First Class . Tacky.
Does anyone know why he always wears nasa gear? Is he an engineer or something?
Why wear NASA
why would the flight from Auckland be ~5k cheaper??!!  That makes no sense to me but good to know.
I am amazed at this guy , every video that he is in traveling anywhere he is always eating steak!  just steak. Whataaaaaaaat
Now that you've reviewed Qantas.  In my opinion, it's overvalue and quite frankly is not worth the dollars in comparison to other airlines (Singapore, Emirate, Qatar, Etihad).
i love marmite and vegimite i dont know how people dont like them
It must be nice to be healthy and wealthy to go on all those flights.
as a picky eater, all the food would be WAY do fancy for me
Doing this tomorrow. Except to LAX. Thanks for the preview ! Spa is booked in :)
I'd  rather go on another 5 trips
not all that impressive,i am afrad. would travel another airline...sod qantas.
Can't stand  these people  who think they are above everyone  elde
the club sandwich in sydney qantas first lounge is  unbelievable.
It seems a bit smaller for a first class seat… 14 in total seems condensed
ALL AMERICANS TAKE NOTE ON HOW YOU APPLY VEGEMITE TO BUTTERED TOAST, THE BUTTER IS A KEY INGREDIENT. DONT EAT IT LIKE NUTELLA 14:52
Dude should see himself as very lucky.. the rest of the world is blowing up!! Im Australian and in glad to say this is c grade compared to what we have in everyday life as an aussie
The First Class doesn't look that great tbh. Not enough privacy.
Has everyone in Australia now posted a youtube video about this trip ????
NASA badges? interested why all the advertising for NASA??? great videos BTW Cheers!
NASA gear, lapel pins...great videos, really like them---WHAY NASA pins and gear/ just a fan???
How do you afford all these super high plane tickets?  Are you sponsored by NASA since you wear a NASA shirt in all your videos? Also why is it that you wear the same shoes/outfits in most if not all your videos?
What a life.  I'm jealous.  I'm also kidding.  More power to ya my friend. Carry on.
Only reason i cant do long flight is i need a cigarette
Where did you learn to love vegemite?
I feel that for the cost of these flights, they need to up their game on the quality of the socks and slippers
what Tims are those?
I thought twas nonstop 😡
eats tim tams but orders a Diet coke.
Awesome review! Subscribed! Hopefully, see you back in Australia in the next 18 months when Melbourne-Heathrow is added to the project sunrise routes. It will be approximately and hour longer than Sydney to Heathrow!
Is bro mewing 😭
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
13:59 did anyone else feel uncomfortable watching the toothpaste climax 😅😂😂😂😂 ❤
On first class: is the food and drinks including alcohol always free and can you be rude and order several meals and take them with you, what about expensive drinks like champagne? can you always take the skin and body care kits with you at home, and the pyjamas?
Looks like an upgraded biz class compared to other airlines
Strange how flying the longer Auckland to Sydney to Singapore to London route at 29hrs is both longer by a fair number of hours and nearly half the price.
Why is this guy alwasy wearing NASA merchandise?
Hello, as an American, why do you always wear the NASA shirts???
That nasa hoodie has more airtime than I have 😂😂😂😂😂
Never get your Tim tams from duty free, way over priced, buy them before you go to the airport
Does he get to keep the PJ?
I wish I could dislike this twice
This is the video I found you
How many countrys u travelled to?
Ok if you can afford it
That damned Nasa logo again.  You do realise that nobody has ever been to the moon or phoned the president from there on a bakalite phkne with a wire on it.  Jesus christ.
Bed Looks OK for a person 5 feet tall.
This crowd must work in cubicles-- here they are stuck in cubicles again on the airplane somebody calls it first.
Test several hrs  meat soaking in your precious Coca-Cola.
All that food. My guy you should be lifting weights!
Ice cold DC, Cheerio mate
But to why im to make the get out.then open the brain F inisial dripos.legenddual max to the appouction.
55 year old native Melbunn bloke here. I used to do circuit training lead by the model known as "The Sheridan Sheets man" because he was the model from their 1990's ad campaign. You never saw his face in the ads, but he was so pretty, and so developed and so CUT the women would sigh when he walked in to take the class and us blokes would fucking CHARGE hoping that   at least we might get the body  he had, knowing we all had heads so rough nothing could save them, and the women of Australia had never seen his better than a Hemsworth face. Long story. I have a serious Dad Bod these days. This was all in the early '90s.
Wow very good choice I love the Shard Tower London in London very much. It reminds me of childhood memories. I love traveling in Qantas and riding the A380...have a nice trip
'Definitely a gruelling experience' is a very polite way to summarise the Sydney to London flight in cattle class. In Australia we'd call it 'a f**cking joke'.
Flew Qantas from London to Sydney first class on the A380, and after only 10 minutes in the air, we were informed that there was no aircrew to take over the flight from Singapore to Sydney, which was the scheduled stop for a crew change.  Because i had a connecting flight from Sydney to New Zealand I couldn't & wouldn't stay in a Singapore hotel for the night without any change of clothing.  I managed "with zero help from Qantas ground staff" a flight on Singapore airline,  I was assured my luggage would be immediately transfered onto the Singapore plane, but guess what, on my arrival into NZ NO bags and it took Qantas 4 days to deliver them and what made it worse it took Qantas 7 months and only after legal proceedings to refund the cost of my flight from Singapore to Sydney and not forgetting the cost a purchasing clothes which at my own expense.   Needless to say, I've never and will never fly Quantas again.  ( it's Qantas' loss as I fly into Australasian region 3/4 times a year and always 1st class)
Great video can you tell me what site you found the cheaper fares from Auckland as I can’t find fares that cheap .
As an Australian I am embarassed. Compared to your video on the same route on Singapore Airlines, the difference is extreme, from the suite to food quality. What an eye-opener. And the price is the same. Gosh.
timtams are the best!
Emirates a380 still better than
Hey Will - why don't you fly on basic economy flights around the world and give us your perspective. 😂
love your content
how do you afford all of this
qantas is with out a doubt the best airline to ever exist
Not just handsome but looking cute too…
Ok, these videos have just landed on my feed for some reason and this is the 10th one I have watched so far. I am curious as to why he pretty much wears the same thing in every video? Was this guy an astronaut or worked for NASA??
These little signs you put up on all your videos, like the first one on this video, 2 Hours Later, it's so childish, it ruins the videos, this is a high end product your reviewing and it's like a kid is doing the report.  Overall I like your videos, but enough with these childish signs.
I’ve been watching all your vids 😊
dude, you really piss me off
Last plane dining choices: Caviar tartlette,  duck salad, fresh salad with balsamic, Seared grouper  And a soy chai latte to finish!
Looks lovely.  My dining choice would be: Skip aperitif and canapés. Sourdough AND roasted garlic bread with butter.  Moroccan tuna, Snapper main with lemon dressed salad and fresh fruit finish. 🎉
Will never fly Qantas international again. The airline ripped off Aussie taxpayers during the pandemic and then proceeded to sack thousands of staff anyway. None of money was ever paid back. They are Australia's most loathed airline these days!
Hi, I'm hooked on these videos (escapism) but what is the NASA connection Will?
$10000? Have you spent anytime in the slums of New Delhi? They have hard time getting fresh clean water and toilet paper.. No air conditioning.. Wow.. You could have bought so many little portable ones for a neighborhood there.. So sorry you got sucked in to spending that much.. SO terrible.. How could you? These airlines can't be charging that much.. Should have been no more than $2500! Who can afford these prices??
I am not jealous of you Sir, but glad for you. God Bless You and Enjoy!!!!!!
I hope NASA are going to be a sponsor in the future :)  love the videos.
I wonder if an airplane crashes, if the experience is premium too. The video you make over the 7 continents, flighting just for flighting is tempting the dead
How dumb do you have to be to not realise that the food is cooked on the ground and heated up in the sky
So odd that this is my local airport and I’m doing this 22h flight in a couple off weeks
Watching this video I can't help but think of the doc i recently watched of people traveling to Australia from England in the 1870s. They traveled by ship which took around 9 months and you were not guaranteed arriving alive. Passengers had to avoid disease robbery and assualt at times,while eating awful food horrible beds and rooms along with open toilets. To see that and  constrast it with this video of modern travel is to see how modern man has become spoiled ungrateful and in some cases unrealistic when traveling today. I think sometimes we are incapable of constasting what has come before us and show how modern humans have become entitled and sploiled with the riches in front of us. More champagne please.
Do you keep all the pj's and amenity kits? Love your videos especially while I'm stuck in bed poorly......thank you xjx
Iconic NASA jacket the Tim’s and the DC
sleeping a full night sleep is really nice on planes. i have only been able to sleep for 7 hours on a plane in my life but i am gonna take a late night 9hr flight by christmas maybe then
TimTams are sold at Walmart in Canada. We love them!
does he get these tickets for free ?to promote the airline and seats they have to offer ?
As a person who’s been to the Austrian Airlines First Class lounge, i rate the Qantas lounge a solid 9/10!
The flying Kangaroo. Good choice.🇦🇺
Really excellent production values, snappy narration, seamless editing great use of music…you’ve created a distinctive and identifiable brand. I’d love to see  ‘how it’s made’ video. Assume you also use a drone? Exterior aerial shots from a cruise ship balcony, for example? I appreciate editing that moves the story forward without being jarring. You enjoy fine dining and champagne much more than I, but I enjoy traveling the world with you.
Oh, poor guy, got flymsy menu 😢
This man is a boozer. He constantly sucking down some champagne.
Honestly mate Diet Coke is rubbish. Try Coke Zero or no sugar.
First class…….in a pair of ripped jeans. Times have changed.
Does he get sponsored by NASA because every he goes he wears a NASA shirt.  If I fly first I dress up, flying just is not as it used to be.
Love the ginger & lemon tea
Incredible video! 🌟 The intro nailed the vibe. First Class and Suite tour showcased luxury beautifully. The onboard lounge is a dream! That bed – pure comfort. Appreciate the breakdown of costs at 15:52. Also, if you're traveling, you should consider Express Parking because it was a hassle-free experience for me. Excited for more content!
Love Quantas ~ no more caviar & champagne for you ~ the extreme rlegance on the ? Emaites ? flight was beyond ~ Liked the plushy bed on Quantas ~ very bright & clean ~ Thank You 🩷🌹
Not going to lie, not very impressed with Qantas first class compared to other airlines
SYD airport is such an outdated POS for an airport. Embarrassing.
I’ve not seen your posting before so I don’t know if you have answered the most basic question, how do afford this trip?   Are you using point which still cost?   It would be nice if you could post this explanation of how you are able to do all these trip.   Placing your story ( of how are afford all the travel)  In your introduction  would be great.
The travel nowadays looks really cumbersome. Even the best seats look torturous let alone if you have to pay for it
Wait 5000 dollars from Auckland where exactly do I find this fare please ???
C UNTAS PMSL .. these muppets have the worst attendants of ANY AIRLINE
I am Australian and I have never tried Neils sauce nor do I know who he is 😂🤭
I go for anything you go for.
Thanks for these vids ... I'm very happy to see a fellow airborne trencherman ....  The Qantas first (which I've never flown) seat seems more like an extremely good business class when compared to Emirates' first compartments (which I've been lucky enough to experience on both the A380 and the triple seven.). Mind you, the Qantas service and dining in your vid seems to be the dog's bollocks.... Thanks again for the great vid.
Aren’t we all excited about Project Sunrise! As a very frequent flyer Australian traveler it’s what we have been dreaming about for ever. At the moment the London - Perth - Melbourne route is the next best thing. (Actually would love to see you review that). But omg I can’t wait for direct flights to Europe and the east coast of America from the east coast of Australia.
I always enjoy your reviews, concentrating on food, beverage, comfort and service.
BINGO!
Most pretentious AvGeek out there.
there was a srilankan brand..DELMAH
Only on a plane that is boujee. Imagine that in a hotel lol. Wouldn't pay $100 a night for it.
more nasa again :(
American fan of Marmite here!  I'm curious about Vegemite; is it different from Marmite or just a different name?
just curious is the $5000 in Australian dollars?
Can someone please ID the song at 10:55?
If you have to travel for 24 hours I will definitely take the Qantas A380 kangaroo route. It certainly beats taking the Greyhound bus in the u.s.a. between Toledo, Ohio and my hometown in eastern North Carolina which is a 24-hour bus ride with several stops and a couple of connections. At least on the Qantas A380 nonstop flight, you don't have to be woken up at 2 a.m. in the morning and Pittsburgh to be forced off the bus for a driver change.
I have been in etihad first class
Nice how u spread the Vegemite thinly over the toast.  Works the same for marmite and promite.
I thought you were Luka Doncic on the thumbnail.
Unfortunately when you compare the QF offering with other A380 first class like, Emirates, Etihad, Singapore it comes a definite 4th.  Particularly when you look at their check-in, the lounges, and in flight offerings.  Having said that I would rather be flying first in a QF A380 than other airlines or lower classes.
How much did they pay you for this? $50000
You😊 should have flown business  class, then you would have money to buy a decent pair of kecks!!
Qantas is an overpriced piece of shit, don’t ever think of the little guy
Tiny ass tv is just sad
Try it in economy for 24 hoours with your seat next to the toilet
Would not fly Qantas again. Done the first class done the business and done the cattle class. There are better out there.
hello, i love to fly with you first class, i enjoyed it and all that food mmmmm a flyed full of luxery and relaxing.thank for showing. greetings from the Netherlands.😄👌👋
6:10 Qatar Airways Economy
Good to see the ripped jeans got to travel in FC🤔....that said, there are better FC options available on other carriers; very informative all the same...nice work.
Why does everything that is first class or any expensive dining experience have to include caviar 🤢
And i bet the Poms still have a whinge  about it 😂
The real question is, how is it like to fly economy class from Australia to England?
9K ex Syd and 5K ex Auckland?.....what currency is that?
Cancel Qantarse! Say NO to The Voice! Qantarse is completely UnAustralian, cancel Qantarse
Youre considered an Aussie if you eat vegimite. Welcome to the club mate ! lol
Having just done this flight (in Economy... urgh) I've beyond jealous. Both of you being able to do this and the channel you have (a dream of mine). Congrats.
why you talking like that? you sound like a bell end bro
Look like absolute sh*t for $10k They are laughing in the faces of the rich.
It’s worth every cent.  Believe me I know.
Enjoyed this video enormously.
I'm learning more and more Brit-slang thanks to you!
Well you can fly for 10k in qantas first class, or for 5k in qatar q suites and probabbly get even better experience. This doesnt look like proper first class.
Worth leaving from NZ as half the price. I’m an Australian and never heard of Neill. QANTAS not known for its food tho. Disappointing. Breakfast - no bacon & eggs then?
I think Japan Airlines has the shortest route to London w 17hrs and a complementary hotel overnight. The bed is single and very short so legs fall off the end. Not comfortable at all. Food in the hotel is very expensive. It flies over the North Pole. On return there’s a 6hr stop in Japan (unfortunately) but if Business or First you have access to a lounge w food, drink and vibrating lounge chairs. The toilets are Japanese so warm water spurts onto your nether regions but 6hrs ugh! That was many years ago tho and that flight may have now changed.
I wish
I have been here its so cool to see the first class
Plane looks like it’s failing apart
Awesome 👌
Das ist so überheblich OMG so good!
i dont think he realised there was caviar on both menus
You are a lot braver than I am eating the summer pudding in a white jumper 😅
Medium rare steak 🤢🤣🤮🤮. Did u ask them to cut it straight off the cow then put it in a microwave then serve? Actually vile! Either Medium well done or well done. No one wants to eat a blood bath
🧀
It's weird that adding another leg and hence distance to your flight itinerary reduces the price by almost half, instead of  increasing it.
7:09 no...the real test is how they serve the economy passengers. That is where you see the true colors of airlines and their employees. Once economy customers of an airline start to truly state that they felt cared for and comfortable that's when truly and airline has won. Providing world class service when someone shells out $10K for a ticket is easy for even a half braindead person to do. Heck US-based airlines don't even do that....they shit upon even the first class travelers.
marmite much much nicer
After  seeing Goyder, Hudson and her sanctamonious side kick Mr Finch at today's Senate estimates enquiry into Qantas' conduct, I'd walk over broken glass before I ever fly with them. The ultimate Australian merger of private corporation and government in bed with each other!  Excellent vlog though, it's not your fault the airline treats Australians like mugs.
how do you afford to fly first class so frequently? are you sponsored by the airlines?
Interesting.  Liked the look of that summer pudding.
crack open an ice cold DC ....
Qantas.. might not have the money to keep up with emirates etc….but is Australian… so you cannot go wrong
Best to fly to Auckland and save $5k isn’t it?
for 10k thats a complete rip off
Why do you show business class cabins when your video is supposed to be about premium economy?
First class Aus to UK start at 18.2k, at that massive price each meal is costing about 2k, and the good sleeping seat and extra area around seat is costing you around 10k, the steak is cooked off the plane, and just reheated for your meal, lolol, regular flight price is about 1.5k
Excellent review - thanks. Well, I can say from experience that Qantas first class is the equivalent of Singapore business class. he qantas beds are so small and the bathrooms look economy size.
Doesnt seem like worth 10K
Really enjoyed this video.. I would absolutely love to fly 1st Class one day 😊
No way that cost only $10k with qantas. I'm stuck paying nearly $2k to fly from Perth to south australia for my next holiday, and thats in peasant class too.
A lover of Vegemite 👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻
0:27 - he's one of our more formally dressed gentlemen... he's wearing some sort of foot covering, guessing he's been invited into the Chairman's Lounge.
Whoever loves Vegemite has a secret scat fetish.
I went to Sydney airport when i was going to Tasmania
qants  time  to london  enggland  home  fliing  sky  classsed  over  nuts   sack  this happy  opera first  class  bed   wine  coffee    and  tea   moves  window
i went to dat airport
Qantas is ass they don't care about customers one bit greedy money hogs
Can’t wait to go back to Australia what a fantastic country
Taking a flight from Australia to LA next month, will be nice to be on one of these super long flights again.
Lemon and ginger tea with a splash of honey is sublime. High recommend.
Qantas has a history that is not great in Australia. They recently lost a high court ruling to pay out 1700 workers that they illegally sacked during covid. I love you Will, but don't support this airline ever,  they are awful.
Looks amazing, and no doubt worth the money if you can afford it. Let's hope lots of people can so that Qantas can use it to fund Joyce's exit bonus and they don't have to continue to screw over their covid customers.
Think yu ono by now this company is not the Australian icon. Its a shell filled with greedy pathic execs and board. Thos is an embarrassment to Australia
From a Melbournian...F Sydney.

Day in a life college basketball
Qantas looks very average these days and is not popular with most Australians.
Real shame Qantas can't sort out the chaos it has domestically!
So much you can do at 38000 ft in first class
Qantas not so good anymore
lol did this not long ago i flew the lowest class
Might be interesting to see what the flight experience is like from the cattle car section.  I am sure Qantas does the best it can for the price point.  Get the feeling it is just a tad different from first class. Which is perfectly understandable, you get what you are willing to pay for.
Loved your video. Very entertaining too. That's the closest this Australian will get to a Qantas flight. We do flights to Europe quite regularly. It's always a choice between Etihad, Emirates and Singapore Airlines. I haven't bothered considering booking with Qantas in about a decade.
Just realised im watching this homeless in my car
Qantas is the safest plane
Hello
how can it be half price to fly further ?
white jumper on a plane .. very risky
qantas is a horrible company
Do you live in aus I do😊
Glad to see they didnt cancel your flight but take the payment anyway. Welcome to Qantas
Awesome video. Keep up the great work mate.
Whilst 9k to sleep its a dream for a nice holiday start.
This video has got me SO excited with ryanair next week 😂
How do you afford to pay for all these expensive flights 😮
trek trendy is every where 🤣we will se him going to space one day
You should go on a 10 hour economy flight next lol
I'll make it short, I'm envious. Fortunately, money doesn't make happiness, ha ha ha! G'day mate!
As an Aussie who just flew to Europe I envy you. Border on hate
Sure that wasn't business class, not up to international first class standard
Les go maungawhau in that 2 second clip at 16:00
yes he spreaded the vegimite with butter and bread thank you
Great adventure! Bravo!
dvt experience
Do you get to keep the pjs?
Vote NO 23
Given that 99% can't afford first class, why dont you review Economy. We just flew it, and its not good.
I'm Australian, so I should be bias but... I really cannot see a huge difference when I flew the new QF Business class back in 2016, and I think even Qatar Business class 'Q-Suites' look better than QF 1st class. Their current 1st class is also clearly not close to the 1st class suites on some other carriers (eg. Emirates) that do the same journey.
😅😊
if there's anything i love about qantas it's their new safety video for their 100 year anniversary. entertaining and keeps everyone's attention equally. would put it on par with the malaysian airline safety video which celebrates their arts and culture.
Dude I cannot believe how much food you eat lol
Why can flying from Auckland be found for half the price compared with going from Sydney, especially with it being further away?? Seems odd..
No way that steak was medium-rare!
9....... 9 hours sleep? On a flight to England? So there is  heaven. Most i ever managed in economy is 9 minutes sleep on a long haul flight :(. Great video as usual!
🥂
As cool as the A-380 is, I'd give a great deal to have gotten to fly that route in a Constellation  (the best looking airliner ever built). For all the jokes about it, when I actually got to try vegemite, I really liked it. I occasionally get a jar (pricey here).
Looks empty
Could you review Qantas and Virgin Australia Business Class?
You must have money to burn.
How come there's such a $$ difference between AUK and SYD departure?
11:35-11:38. How did you do that!
10K - I think I'd take SIA anyday.
I live in Melbourne and I remember going on that flight in economy 😢
Do you know Pommery is the worst/cheapest Champagne brand ?
Funny as all the Qantas first flights have been selling for +$18,000 and have been for the last 9 months...!
Singapore is NOT a “tech stop” for QF1. A tech stop is only where the aeroplane stops for fuel or some other technical reason, where passengers do not disembark or join the flight. Singapore is therefore a transit stop.
This IS exactly my next flight seat !  😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃
You get that joke of a spred Marmite out here
for the love of god, please start dressing the part...I love your videos...once I get past your wardrobe
It stopped in my city Karachi 🇵🇰 Pakistan
I dont know the comfort of the "buddy seat (as you call it for adults but my two young daughters love the seat so they can sit together, play games, eat, whatever.
It’s a shame therefore, that Qantas is so appalling in economy.
all of this in skinny jeans. Shooketh.
Hi - Wow and I pay for my own journeys….. and just a question :  are you part of NASA and their Solar System aso….. ?? or did you just buy your sweater..? You know - in DK we have an astronaut in the next 6 mdt’s…. maybe you meet him in space ? Best regards from DK….
Imagine being that plane’s pilot
Low n behold Qantas offering Kiwis cheaper rates
I avoid QANTAS for all flights domestic and abroad.  They are racicist, arrogant and the CEO is a pampas whatever.  You pay  times more, just so they can walk around with a terrible attitude.  My business flights are with virgin and partnered airlines, more pleasant, although KLM buso is great too.
i think he is very rich because he works for nasa i think
Very enjoyable video and envious of your first class experience!
Fun Fact: One of the writers for the 1988 Academy Award winning film Rain Man was actually upgraded to first class when the staff realized who he was on a Qantas airplane because one of the lines from the film when Raymond and his brother are at an airport Raymond says Qantas never crashed.
Considering you have just spent 24 hours on an aircraft you look remarkably fresh. On a side note, you look as though you've lost some weight!
This first class look mid as hell
As an Australian  Vegemite is nothing like marmite 😂
I finally bought some Tim Tams and OMFG THEY ARE SOO GOOD
Sleeping in a makeshift bed, fully horizontal with a decent telly is everybody's dream for a long haul flight experience. I don't require caviar or Krug, just a bed and a nice bathroom. I'm still reeling from the video of you showering at 40,000 feet AND having your own bed and big arse TV of your own. HEAVEN.
Why are airlines torturing passengers in economy class? All travels by air should be like in business or first class. Surely after 50 years or so there must be some sort of progress on how to make traveling by air more efficient and less costly for ordinary people without throwing comfort in the trash bin? Even well paid people cant afford flying in first class. That makes economy class the only option. But my experience is that airlines treat economy passengers like animals. Flying has become less and less enjoyable.
Loves his tucker !
Where do people get the money from
I'd rather pay for £10,000 worth of sandwiches for homeless people.  Once these companies start to regulate their money properly, I'll go 1st class.
No wine with food??
If you agree, flying is just so fun and memorable. For example when I was 4 I flew from Sydney to, London now after 7 years I still remember and love. Love, love, flying.
Not even remotely worth 10k LOL  3-4k MAX
My dream one day - QF1 to London in First. PS Thanks for your video - great production quality.
Must save to do this. Did Brisbane to Buenos Aries. Totally destroyed. Over 18hrs in cattle class at 6'2" is VERY unpleasant.
Hi. Whats the brand of the carryon you use for your trips?
I have never seen Qantas aircraft interior till now.  They definitely have nice colors and layouts! Enjoyed mate!
I did Melbourne to Singapore on the a380
POMPOUS
These flight paths are scams so people pay more. Really it should only take 12-18 hours no longer
i dont know how it's possible for you to make a 16 minute video feel 5 minutes long 🤯
So it's cheaper for Aussies to fly to NZ so they get a far better price? That's crazy but then just goes to show how expensive this country has become!!!
dude enough with the classy piano sounds, more modern sounds, ur stuff might come off as an old porno flick lmao.
$10,000 for that?! Macaroni cheese for $10k? Haha airlines are taking the piss. Pathetic.
The unspeakable chasing the inedible,
That steak sandwich looked banging for saying you were up in the air 😁 another great video 🤙
I whent to Australia in 2019 with Qantas in the a380 it was just like a normal plane ride because I was in econamy
Dude you sound like an Australian news reporter
WHERE ARE YOU IN AUSTRALIA ! I want to meet you
Fabulous. Thank you.
9 hours of interrupted sleep on a plane. what a treat!
Mate you went that entire video pronouncing Qantas wrong! Its actually "Qaint Arse".
Those first class seats look almost similar to the turkish airlines business class i flew in from Sweden to South africa. The lounge (idk if just was a gold lounge) was similar aswell. You could also close it so it became like your own mini room
For $10,000, the food looks pretty average compared to any decent restaurant.
disgusting immoral airline, will NEVER fly qantas, they could not be further from the spirit  of australia
10 grand and you only get two Lindor with your tea
Finally someone spreaded the Vegemite out right🎉
And another video,  with a fella dressed the same as the last 20 videos,  stuffing himself silly like the last 20 times, drinking champagne like a hobo, same music as last 20 times,  why not do something interesting and fly ryanair and drink a coke and a sausage roll
Know you pay 10k for the flight but the meals like stake looks lovely
More like 22 hours my guy
I love when clueless/fools or the combination of both use words like "complimentary/free/included on a 10k fly ticket👍🏻😅...or when they seem so surprised and pleased after they get "offered" some bubbles whilst waiting for the same 10k flight😅 Have you ever asked yourself how many times round have you actually paid for that glass of whatever???😌🤦🏻‍♂️ You are simply paying 10x / 20x and pretending there are people out there that, just because you have a pretty face, give you whatever, for free...it's hilarious really🤣🤣🤣 Come on folks...a bit of reality check every now and than!👍🏻😏
Why as a Brit do you always talk In Dollars? I am just curious.
Qantas lounge is great. My dad has diamond one world status so I've experienced it quite a few times.
Done this trip many times both ways but always cattle class! I’ve done a few shorter trips between NZ and Oz on Emeritus business class and it’s outstanding. The food was better than the quants looked and I believe the first class us unbelievably good. The main reason I haven’t done the long hall business class is because I’m told once you do it once your ruined and broke for life. So I stick to the economy as I’d rather do two or three trips home to the uk a year than one. That’s what it comes down to.
So Australia to London is $11000, but Auckland to london is $5200 ?  You realise, thats twice as much you twat? (And NZ to Australia is about a 1 hr flight)
god this guy is insufferable
Wow! What an amazing video. Love your editing and commentary. You flew, First class and this video was definitely, first class. Respect 👍
Surprised Qantas didn’t cancel the morning of the flight. They’re good at that.
Who gives a shit? Do this in cattle class like the rest of us.
Loved the video. Can I ask, weird question. Do you know what Timberlands they are? I’ve tried finding them on the websites and I love them but can’t find the exact same style. Maybe the range has changed but wanted to ask what they were called? If you didn’t mind?
Love this
Im in Queensland rn I came from perth
I fly 24hrs Auckland to London 1st Class Emirates 6x per year. It’s way better than Qantas especially the onboard shower which means I can refresh 1hr before landing. And if I go back to Business Class the big bar area is a cool place to hang out. Plus the pyjamas you get from Emirates 1st are great - I’ve got loads of pairs (and so have my friends now) 😊
mate have a go at your attire in singapore it must be 34c at least lol
you should know that aspertain is a caecogin derived from formaldehyde,  its a component in diet coke
i'm convinced everyone who wears NASA logo clothes are gay
When I saw the thumbnail for a second there I thought he was in a NASA spaceship or something
Good video!! Very informative enjoy the experience 🤙🏽
I’m so amazed at how much of this is filmed in slow-mo. Great video but it’s distracting!
That is worth flying. Now where’s that winning lottery ticket. 🤔
wwww
I did this flight last year.. in economy.. my back still hurts 😂😂
Hmmm, starters is a tough choice. The gnocchi with prawns and duck salad both sound good. Probably the prawns with a nice Aussie semillon/sauv blanc. Mains would probably be the beef fillet with an Aussie shiraz. Lamb cutlets would have been nice but preferably not crumbed. I would then probs have the selection of cheese with the rest of the bottle of shiraz, followed by the raspberry & blackberry pud AND Maggie Beer ice cream with some more of that French champagne (just leave the bottle with me). Wake me up when we reach London. 👍
You must be on the payroll of Qantas.  Good luck ever buying that ticket for $10k. That’s the price for business class. And  Qantas service has declined a lot since pre Covid. 9 out of 10 flights late. Priority luggage comes out late. Crew & Staff work hard but Qantas are skimping on everything.  Old fleet, tired fit-out.  Alan Joyce maximising profits so he can get his bonus on the way out. Qantas is not what it used to be. Shop around.
1st class? You still have the public to deal with before you turn left. Fly private, trust me, no comparison. Just ask Swiftie, she's the most influential carbon footprinter in the world!
I’d call this premium business compared to other airlines.
Qantas are the experts in media manipulation...Qantas has been gutted by a grub CEO..  helping it barely making it in the top 20 airlines in the world...lost luggage poor customer service...its not the airline it once was....
Slightly more palatable? At half the price? Jeez, that detour to Auckland sounds totally worth it.
Was that return fare or 1 way ?
I flew qantas back to Australia from Dubai.  It was horrible 😂
Looks so lonely 😞??
Not near enough vegemite on that toast.
I wonder if there is a place to have a shave !!!! there will be loads of time to shave off your copy cat Beard
near a $1 a mile 🤯
You travelled for 24 hours and wore jeans?!
Oh no!  Not a non-leatherbound menu.  LOL
No caviar?. FAIL.
qantas are shit brother! they lost there way due to olmate at the top!!!!
Does it even feel like youre flying?!?
2005 - Vintage... lols
a non Australian eating Vegemite without a spoon and therefore enjoying it is a mood
Qantas is doggy doo it used to be good
I certainly don't enjoy cattle class to England, I'vedone that route a few times. Changi airport is enormous  !! 3 hrs off the plane, barely make it to the food and back..My brother has lived there for 20 years now, We always visit one another.  Wish I could afford 1st class.  Nice vid mate, very well done. Cheers.   Edit: glad you like Vegemite,   I've litteraly  just posted a package to my brother, his wife and kids,  Vegemite  is a must,  and he can't get cherry ripe either -(  it's a chocolate bar) and I made some beautiful Aussie beef jerky also.
I haven't been on the qantaslink plane for a very long time but it would be cool to be in the top of an airbus
Qantas first sucks compared to other airlines
Did you have a poo during the flight?
I wonder who this neil the chef is - can't think of one, as an australian!
Mmm even from a distance the ultra luxury doesn’t seem there - missing laminate from the door, pilling on the seat..... just like everything Qantas, it’s just more expensive
I think I will stick to business class
not the longest flight in the world..
Those idiot's wearing masks!
Qantas is awesome, the CEO is a grub.
I love Mac and cheese
Worlds longest flight on the worlds worst airline
aw man he didnt vist the mcdonalds in sydney airport
INCREDIBLE ? Such a old and outdated product.
Why do people think caviar  is needed it is bad
You are too much of a snobbish guy with your endless champagne and caviar for my taste, despite the fact that you make nice videos. Tone down your assumed snobbery and you will become a more likeable fellow.
you're offically banned from saying g'day ever again
it's look like a premium business class not a real first one.
24 hours Australia to England .. not accurate unless you include both ways 😂
I would rather take a right hook from Mike Tyson then do 24 hours in economy
England is the best country in the world
What are them timberlands? ? Proper smart
Veggiemit tastes like Australia
Neil who???
Hong kong
Saw the Cathay plane and I realized I have to fly 15 hours to Los Angeles from hog kong
A smug alert at 35,000ft
these plane companies are missing on xbox 360 with pro evolution and ea basketball to finish up time.,.
I like to watch this but you have to admit, yer man is a bit of a prat 😅
Where do you get your NASA hoodie from
Honestly, thought the First bathroom would be a bit more "upper class" / looked after.
This will be my new apartment...😊
Every time there's a small complaint about something like the flimsiness of the menu I go through the same process of rolling my eyes and then remembering the cost of the ticket and being like.... fair.
Pffft I've flown Syd - Lon and smoked on the plane....
9:25 just re-heated, it's easy
Any tips for getting this same flight for that price?
Finished watching 16:21
Vegemite is nothing like marmite! :P
Yeah I'm not sold on these reviews. They seem very rehearsed and favourable to the airline. I'm not saying that the experience didn't deserve a good rating but it just stinks of being given a seat by the airline in exchange for a good review. Josh Cahill wouldn't have had the same experience.
I want to ask, did you pay for this flight yourself or was this given to you by Quantas? I ask as it will probably affect my judgement on this video if you received a paid flight from the airline.
NASA = Never A Straight Answer …
Qantas miles redemptions seem to require so many more miles compared to other Airlines
Hi tamil
Let's make something clear...those might be Timberland brand shoes...but they're NOT Timbs.
I assume the Cheap menu is because they constantly update it every so often
Last week I flew from JFK Airport to Amsterdam in Economy. Next time I will have something better 😂
Could have worn a proper pair of jeans without holes in it, If I was at the airport would have denied you entry!
As an aussie its amazing to see you enjoy our flights and to see that they treated you well! My sister and i love your videos always a pleasure to watch!
Fun fact back in 1942 six of these ww2 planes shot down by the zero and this was a war crime because Qantas was a civilian plane not military but they would have gotten a escort to protect their important cargo for the allied forces on the ground
Why is all of his narration in the same tone? It dips at the end like a newsreader. I could also really do without the slow motion when he eats. It’s a shame because his videos are interesting.
All of this is great except for the DC. I am more of a CZC fan, however, in many cases, even just straight CZ can be difficult to get.
❤
Raspberries are  STRAWBERRIES
I would do the salad of roasted duck etc. That would be followed by the snapper incocounut garam masala. Then the cheese .. with walnuts, black grapes and poppyseed sesame lavosh.
this guy has the ultimate jaw chewing, jaw breaking, teeth biting English accent..he took the English accent to a new level, its almost painful trying his accent..
I can picture myself doing this, and ordering endless diet cokes !
I like your videos we all do but switch up the food bro its always just steak and some type of chocolate dessert 😅
I'm surprised the steak doesn't have vegemite!!!!
Why on earth is it cheaper when Auckland is further away?
To add to the bingo card - "My girlfriend", TT probs has said it every video this year. No hate, just giving me of Jay off the Inbetweeners vibes lmao
I'm vicarious living through you..!! 😊
Looks amazing 😁🥰
Honestly don't think it's worth the extra money compared to business class. (Caveat - I flew for almost free) You get a bit of extra room/privacy compared to business, but business passengers also get access to the upstairs lounge etc. The menu is a bit nicer, but the difference between the wines/service is negligible, though the menu choices might be higher if I recall. Also I got food poisoning one time I flew first, so that might colour my POV. For twice the price of business, I really don't think it's worth it. ETA, you also get PJs in Business and a nice bathroom.
I want to try "Tim Tams".
Great video! Your editing skills are awesome. You showed us 16 minutes of a 24 hour flight. I don't think I could sit that long on a plane and do nothing. Crack on!
Fairly sure if Trek Trendy got on a trip to the moon 80% of the vlog would be about food. lols
You ordered exactly what I would have ordered! Even the tea! Great minds. 😁👍🏻
Just don’t get the ripped jeans look. Especially flying at this level. Seems like you don’t respect the position your in. No idea what is up with the NASA gear either. Yet, here I am watching again.
At least Neil’s steak tasted good!
looked very good ❤🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Since the leprechaun (aka Alan Joyce) took charge of Qantas, it's gone downhill. Sad to say that as an Aussie, I will never fly this airline again.
Just hit that “follow” button. I am sure this channel is going to be my new favourite 🎉
fantastic a380 vision of take off and landings - great review all round
Love your videos… one ? Do you have another hoddie
Could you make a compilation of all your recommended tips and tricks? Things like if you are a member of any clubs, rewards programs, etc.
New to the channel. What the story with all the NASA accessories and clothing? 😊
I love the background music. Where can I get hold of it?
The bathroom and the food and drink offered onboard is what I would go for. From watching your videos that is Singapore and Emirates. Actually you have ruined air travel for me Mr Will Davies 😅. Thanks Trek Trendy. From now on it's first class NO it's luxury all the way. Caviar and Clicquot....you sell luxury very well hahahahaha Love it 👍 Love your channel X
Looks amazing! Great video as always!
Sap that I am, I teared up last November when they played the new safety video on qantas.
I just wanted to compliment you, your very handsome and you have great hair. Just saying
It’s great to see you review my favourite airline. Have had the privilege 5 times to travel Qantas First. Always feel so special, especially when travelling home and hearing those flight attendants’ Aussie accents again. 🇦🇺
Hi YouTube
How come you wear only nasa tshirts, hoodies etc?
1-2-1 first class suite = Qatar business class
I've watched so many Trek Trendy vidios, I'm going to comment on a frequent irritant in videos that I love and will contue to watch.  If getting the "Tims" off is such a milestone for comfort, maybe there's something available that would be more comfortable to wear? So much so that taking them off wouldn't be such a milestone for every video?  I wear and recommend Addidas Samba Classics for all air travel. If I took them off and put on some random airline slippers, I doubt there'd be much improvement.  Get better footwear!
Man I love your accent
Awesome videos!!! Love your NASA wear...
ME MY DAD AND MY MOM HAVE 10000 DOLLARS HOW CAN I BOOK THIS PLS REPLAY
Why do you call your shoes Tim's?
The buddy seat works and is awesome
Why do you always wear that sweatshirt, jeans and the same tennis shoes in all your videos? Are you sponsored by NASA?
White socks .. it's not the 80s anymore.
@Trek Trendy, why are you so addicted to caviar??
Just got back from London to AKL
Can you do from Manchester Airport to Lanzarote
For 10k I will row to UK 😂...
Caviar is literally the most gross thing I can taste.
How much does it cost..
Absolutely loving your travel videos. My bucket list gets longer every day. Have you considered the Golden Chariot train in India? I can't find a decent review video of this train but of the still images I've seen it looks absolutely sumptuously luxurious. Might be worth a look.
Can you please advise which is the best backpack to travel with?
I did the exact trip flying first class in 2014. It was fantastic.
I bet that was fun in first class
Hi it’s Paul first time watching your channel it’s brilliant keep up the great work your videos are so slick
Try and Emirates airlines airlines first class they are the best
xo watching these plane travel videos. I miss traveling. I wish I could afford all of this, I'd be so gone! enjoy & stay safe fan from the united states, south Central Arkansas.I use to fly Pan Am great experience.
That is the life for sure! Thanks for sharing how the other half lives.
Cám ơn video của bạn
I enjoy watching your adventures!!
Where's millie?
Would love for you to dop a review of the world's longest journey solely by train from Portugal to Vietnam
BRING BACK MILLIE
No Millie, no me!
Airbus A380 first introduced by Singapore Airlines in 2007. Not sure where you got the idea from that it is a 40 year old aircraft?
Look at me im a NASA fan boy 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤡
It great to see you in Australia. You should try to go on a sugar cane train if its even possible. Awesome video!
🎉🎉🎉Brilliant did you hurt yr ear? 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Do you work for Nasa?
Very informative flight review buddy, look forward to the next instalment.
THIS IS JUST A COOL VIDEO OF TRAVELING THE WORLD ON FIRST CLASS
Used to always get the various Tim Tams when in Australia. If you miss them , just get some Penguins
When you said ofcourse timtams I instantly had the greatest respect for you!
sorry but how the f**k they made a medium rare steak on a plane???? I know they have galleys where they heat up food and plate them nicely but a steak????? please someone explain this. I doubts they literally fry them on the plane
Living the life.
Love the videos!!! Man honestly, how are you able to afford these flight’s so often?!! That’s awesome man 🔥
as an aussie im suprised a youtuber like you would be in australia
You really need to break the DC habit!! Healthier just to drink C straight up! Those carcinogens will get you.
Are you a real astronaut?
Ok, first question 🙋‍♀️ what’s a timtam?? Nest, thanks for allowing me to experience first class travel. It’s a great way to decompress from everyday life. You would think that all long haul first class should be in suites.
Please fly PIA(Pakistan international airline) first class in your next video.
My son lost luggage, no one responds and cut telephone line
OH MAN I WAS READY TO CHILL AND THEN BOOM CONNIE- THATS MY FAVOURITE PLANE EVER AND MY AUTISTIC ASS STARTED FREAKING OUT 😻😻😻😻
Did the openness of the seat feel off putting in comparison the the enclosed suites most airlines are going with?
Shoutout Raymond Babbit
Right
How did it work out cheaper to fly from Auckland as opposed to Sydney???
Yeah trying to be objective but I really feel you are a knob. A flying bus and just as boring.
What type of watch are you wearing?
What model of Timberlands are you wearing?? Look very comfy
The menu is still disappointing for vegetarians. There's been some improvement in the last 20 years, so it's not just pasta or a side of vegetables, but they still seem to be under the misapprehension that people avoiding meat are also avoiding protein.
Looks like business class to me. That ain't a real first class. Qantas no clue.
I did a 9.5 hour flight in coach from Atlanta to Honolulu and that was a bit much. Delta doesn't serve Vegemite, unfortunately.
Great video as always. Definitely a flight I would love to take.
9:15 "Neil" is referring to Neil Perry who is indeed a famous Australian chef. He has restaurants around the country
Nice 👌
Can anyone tell me the name of the music at the very end please?
On these flights I'm keen to know if you are allowed to keep the items on the flight like slippers,sleepwear etc...
So my man, you’re really paying 10k for these tickets … funded by this channel? Hats off to you. Do you think the price tag is worthy of the experience?
I got to ask - do you keep all the amenity kits? And also having never been provided with pyjamas on a flight do you keep them!? Editing is on point in this video! Great video as ever!
So pleased you have shared the flying kangaroo with your audience Will. We are pretty proud of her! You might just be an honorary Aussie,Tim Tams and vegemite! 👏🇦🇺
What happened to their strict dress code at lounges?? I was waiting for them to turn you dow for wearing hoodie and ripped jeans
Okay I wanted to ask this for a long time: does he work for NASA?
You need to actually try Double Choc Tim Tam's....that's where it's at!
Flew out to Sydney on QF2 a380 in premium economy and had separate larding passes for each leg - lady n next seat to me got off at Singapore, as you say Qantas give separate tickets.  Makes sense.  They do same with qf9 .  Really impressed with the experience.
You know you've made it, not when flying first class but Opera browser is sponsoring you 🎉🎉🎉
Tou should try Finnair's unique business class.
You fly around the world, the most expensive seats, and yet dress like a douchebag
I've always wondered, have you had any problems with people objecting to you closing your window???
it was a great experience .. first clsss, SYD to LHR in 16 mins .. no packing, no jet lag, no expense .. thank you
Watching this after experiencing qf1 in economy and not sleeping 😂
To be honest I found Qantas the worst airline I've used. I fly first class from Australia to the UK every two years and Emirates are the best by far. Absolutely the best. I've used BA, they are shite. Cathy are really good. Singapore are OK. For the last 4 flights I've only used Emirates.
Been watching your videos for a while, but forgot to mention. But what's with the nasa?
QF1 is my favourite flight.  I have only flown it in Economy class compared to flying QF9 to London in Premium Economy.  I prefer the A380 and would love to go First Class one day.  Love your videos and thanks for reviewing Qantas.  I hope you enjoyed your Tim Tams too :) Did you get any on board too?
Qantas is bullocks
I love this channel and have watched ... [contemplates time spent] a lot of videos. I have one question as an economy/coach flier, is there no turbulence in First Class/Business?! It's nuts!  For example, in the "My Private First Class Suite to Dubai - Onboard Emirates" from a year ago, on most of my flights, the first class table setting he gets, particularly the inherently wobbly champagne glass and all the small dishes, would end up on the ceiling or the floor from turbulence. And yet, they set up the table in First Class like it's guranteed smooth sailing forever! How is this possible?!  How does First Class operate in turbulence? Is "Trek Trendy" supernaturally lucky to never have turbulence? Does he edit out all the times all the food on his tray table ended up in his lap?
So good.. But the clip of the planes in front of the city?  Nicely done photoshop. The city isnt that close to the airport! :)
Okay hear me out the price off that ticket isn’t too bad London to New York (6 hours) with British airways first (buisness at best😂) is £10,991 just saying
Another entertaining video . Thanks!
What about the non-stop flight?  Curious to hear your impressions.
Why does the guy always wear nasa?
was that a jet star flight taking off?
9hrs... I can't even do that sleep at home.
Do you always script your every word on these videos or is that how you always sound?
I would not sleep on this flight. I would savour every minute!
Was this flight in January 17th? I was on that flight as well. I thought I saw you walk past in Sydney. I recognised the NASA shirt and I mentioned to my mother. I can also say that Prawn Gnochi dish was amazing, they served it in business as well that day. I wanted to come and say hi to you but I was sitting far away when you walked passed to boarding.
It’s definitely not my favourite lounge
I have been to that lounge 11 times
I find this first class less impressive compared to the Emirates
You’ve earned a new follower! Man you are really funny. I love my regular cokes but good for you to stick with diet cokes which seems to be a running theme in all do your videos. 😂
Impressive video like all of them really. Do sponsors pay for all your travel or are  you simply loaded?!
Why do I like the safety video more than the flight when I fly with Qantas?
Bro jou drink so much champagne so your a alcoholist
Australian is proud. As an Australian, going on Qantas two weeks ago, lovely to see you acknowledge our sacred airline
Why do you talk like a newscaster? Always going down tone at the end of every sentence..
Qatar business is still so much better than Qantas 'First'!
Fab video,thank you for sharing.
What is the name of the watch you wore?
You get the best Qantas treatment if you're White Anglo....too bad if you ethnik.....gay stewards are the worst
Well presented
9 hours?! cmon you lazy bum get up!
done that journey once;but economy class: seemed to go on for everx
Exactly- I don’t to ask about Russia bc the answer is known - secrets they can’t tell but Isreal our neighbour
Qantas is a total crap airline
Another great video - cheers 👍🏼  I might have missed it, but I thought you may have provided a comparison re: the Qantas 1st vs the others you’ve tried? Emirates, Air France etc.   It’s a fair comparison yeah, the pre-flight on ground experience, hard product & food in the air, and post flight experience.   None are cheap - would have been interested to hear your thoughts.
Your videos are relaxing and a welcome stress reliever!😊
It’s insane to think that a journey that took sailors months to do can be done in a day
Singapore isn’t really a tech stop, London can’t be done nonstop but plenty of revenue in Singapore, originating, destination, and stopover traffic. Tech stop implies no traffic rights, eg New York to Taipei via Anchorage
How much extra did Qantas pay for you to say that lump of coal was medium rare?
Singapore offers Caviar. Qantas offers bread.
NASA
Thanks for taking a bullet for us. I'd rather sit here and watch my computer screen.... I HAAAAAAAAAAATE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU... 😛
More Millie please
Why NASA? Haven't gotten an answer yet.
How dare you suggest that Vegemite is anything like Marmite!
Cannot imagine 24hrs in economy class. 12hrs is more than enough.
Great video and I can see how easy it would be to get very drunk on the flight!
Hi
diet coke is bad for you and helps keep your weight up. it causes insulin resistance which makes your body keep store more fat on the body
When you hear that ‘TODAY’ you know it’s going to be a good video. AKA, every video. There’s something just so calming about these videos!
"Was disappointed the menu wasn't in a leather bound folder" - ffs. 🙄
Amazing definitely would love to experience this I've only experienced luxury equestrian events. Glad to see you're doing well!
Dude…. Love your videos and content (especially the train ones) but please, please stop calling it a DC 😂. It’s not a DC. It’s a Diet Coke. Literally no one calls it DC.
I flew from London to Sydney in First class!  Nice!!!!
Good quality video👍
disappointed its not Boot "timb's"  off! 🥲🥲
Have you considered doing the Transcantabrico train in northern Spain?  It looks fantastic from the publicity, but there don't seem to be any English-language reviews and my Spanish isn't really good enough to watch a video entirely in Spanish.
If it was possible my ass would fly it with Ryan air    Doin this as cheap as possible. 10k is just a bit much.
How many times you have to fill your stomach? I guess the toilet in your section was occupied 22 out of 24 hours. 3A stupidity. Capitalism at its worst.
So pathetic. People fall for this?
Two questions. a) How do you eat all that in a white sweatshirt/s and don't drop anything? (especially while flying!) b) How come it's a lot cheaper to fly from NZ?
Thanks for posting.    I would change my mind to fly Qantas first class @ $10k after watching this video.  Sorry I say this in a nice way.  The 5k price tag from Auckland to London is pretty good.  Happy and safe travelling everyone ❤️👯🙏🥂✈️
Where are you originally from?   And Why do you always wear the same thing in your videos.  Love The Travel Videos.
Let's face it, Trek Trendy eating caviar and steak on a plane, as well as drinking diet Coke, champagne and coffee is similar to Joshua Weissman saying "B-roll".
your D.C is making you F.A.T
Love Singapore 😇
Amazing vlog
Really enjoying these videos, have been subscribed for a while but I've obviously missed the NASA relevance, can someone elucidate please?! Thanks
I love ur vids u are very interesting
Great video 😮
From all of your videos & all of your luxury Air travel vids--this(quantas first class) was the least impressive.  I don't see the purpose of spending $10,000 when you could almost get the same space in business class.  Just imagine how many homeless people or poor families could have ate for AN ENTIRE month on that amount!
$10,424 for Qantas First Class and you got vegemite toast for breakfast 🤣 you got ripped off
I'd pay a million bucks for a flight just to get the fuck out of Sydney.
Oh my goodness I love your style of review videos! So informative, entertaining and relaxing. My fav reviewer
I hate these videos i dont know why i torture myself watching them .. maybe its just jealously and makes me want to travel more
FINALLY!! As a fellow aussie I have always wanted you to show youtube QANTAS. Another great video Will! I also LOVE a good tim tam by the way! I also loved the history of this amazing flight you are going on. Another great video!!!
Great Job Mate...
I don't get it. Who would want to leave Australia for England anyway?
S/o vietnam airline tho at 2:42 🇻🇳
Thanks for reviewing qantas!
This might be the reality for you when being paid to make this advert. But reality for us mugs down the back is they are one of the worst airlines in the world for service. Food is terrible, staff unfriendly and toilets are filthy.
*SQ21 is the worlds longest direct flight*
I really love your content. The plane and cruise videos are fun to watch but I love the train ones most of all. Flying has always been a pretty stressful experience for me and cruises have resulted in seasickness. Trains on the other hand? I've been on trains and never had an issue. If I were to ever going on a trip I'd definitely do one of those first class trains. Even got me considering taking a vacation myself! Perhaps someday.
Great video and i'm just curious, What is with the nasa clothing?
Great video! My husband just got back from a short plane trip today and my 8yr old son, who loves to watch your videos with me, asked him “did they serve warm mixed nuts and champagne?” LOL! 😂 he said no, I got one cookie and some water hahah
As a person that has worked for the Airlines Always pay attention to what your Flight Attendant says!
Paid 8-10k for first class on a 14 hour flight, sleep 9 hours of the flight 😂
Nice video thanks for sharing
Smug arrogant channel
This guy is so boring, he’s like stock photos
Love your videos !!!
How on earth can this same flight be 50% cheaper from another 3 hours further away? Am baffled
It's may 2. Your videos are so good.  Your commentary and voice are so relaxing. I wanted to go to Hawaii all my life. I know I can't.
Todaaaaaaay!!!
I love your videos. You must do a lot of exercising when you're home
Love the video, but if you really want to keep up appearances, choose a wardrobe that is compatible with First Class :)
Dude this guy really loves champagne
Serious question. if you sleep 9 hours does this eliminate getting jet lag, please?
Worried about this dude's heart
https://youtu.be/ks-EOvi4YWA
Another entertaining report thank you! Please do consider taking a WSET qualification though - it would broaden your knowledge of wines and their pairing with food and make your F&B views more credible. Marcel Brinkpeter is obviously more knowledgeable in this area and it shows on his reports
I mean, after the Orient Express this must be like using the public toilet at Thorpe Park
Glad you survived the disappointment of the flimsy menu
I really like Quantas, but I am not exactly impressed with the plane layout here. Seems quite behind Emirates.
Great video as always. Timms where did you get them? Nice
Thanks for the video. You're one of the few "Tubers" who have reviewed Qantas, and it's nice that you have given it a good review. I've been a frequent flyer since 1994 and a shareholder since 2001. I've always found Qantas to be a great airline, and have enjoyed a number of upgrades from economy to premium economy or business. One huge positive is on longer flights, attendants are always on hand to offer water or fresh fruit every 90 minutes or so. On numerous other carriers, once the main meal is served, the attendants disappear down the back of the plane for almost the entire flight - not to reappear until the latter snack is served. I have also enjoyed the meal options on Qantas flights. A lot of competitors have really gone downhill in that area. Unfortunately, the wider media in Australia have made a concerted effort to drag the airline's name through the mud. I think the service, as you have shown, speaks for itself.
On my last A380 flight (Qatar airlines, Gatwick to hone (Perth) i was lucky enough to get all 4 seats at the very last row in Ecomomy. It was glorious. A whole "bed" to myself. Loads of space. Plane was about 2/3rds empty 🙂👍.  Closest ill ever get to the higher classes.
I have to keep up appearances 😆😆
Hi Will,  love your videos.  What site did you make your flight booking?
Impressive how you manage to be pretentious and low rent all that the same time.
Sounds sooo boring. I rather fly economi and eat at Michelin star restaurants at my destination
Just think.  $10000. You can stay in a nice hotel for 1  month for   $300 a night.
wtf is the lady in the background doing 14:29
I'd just like to know when planes are actually going to have a barista on board...??? The number of times of flown and thought I'd to myself that I'd really like a decent cup of coffee right about now... I really don't care for the drinks menu. Just a decent cup of caffeine. I'm actually really surprised that almost all flights still don't have any decent onboard coffee options...
Another great review, we need to see more of your hairy chest in future videos😁
Qantas first class looks like most international airlines business class. Not impressed
Any airline other than Qantas...the first class is pretty ordinary.
never felt so jealous in my life 😍
This guy must be the chaviest looking fucker they'ver ever seen on any first class flight
My pal bhairab Dutt is in Australia did you meet him
Why do you have to take all your luggage off if you’re getting back on the same plane?
The man loves his DC’s
This first class look a bit like a good business class. Having said that i would totally chose it if doing this route.
I was waiting for your next video to be uploaded, and there it is from my home city! Just noticed there wasn't your usual direct to camera stuff, which I think is an awesome part of your reviews. Were Qantas funny with you recording and talking on board? Or just the mammoth journey? Either way, great vid!
It would be interesting to discover U completely naked taking a good shower, with all due respect man! 😉🤤👌🏻😜
100 points awarded for the correct application of vegemite. Too often, tourists to Australia just pile it on too thick and wonder why they hate it. Toast, Butter, relatively thin scrap of the Vegemite... Perfect.
You def finessed points and credit status with airline right?
Cheaper from auckland which is further away.....
I hate long flights.  London to Australia was better in 1970
Quantas can stick it where the sun doesn't shine. Our family will never use them ever again.
man i love your vids so good
Bro love ure job 😂😂👍🏾
I was at the airport that day saw you depart
Another great video.
from london to sydney would have been more eye pleasing  still a great journey
Qantas needs to up its game
That price really isn’t bad considering how long you’re in the air in first. Good video!
How original
Steak and champagne, always show up in your video. XD
great video!!!!!
Honestly, for $10,000, on a 24 hour flight, Qantas really cheaped out here.  I was expecting more, for that price tag.
"as I want to save my appetite for the onboard dining"  You've got 24 hours on the plane, my guy!  😂
Is your food part of the cost? $10,000 seems to be too much.
You are taking first class Ticket I beleive you will staying in most expensive hotel so if start making videos on it we will happy to watch
Hello My brother Trek. Why are not making videos on Luxury hotel ? Please start making videos on luxury hotel and Yacht and other.
Lol nice try. We all know Australia is a fake country  Seriously, if you're really on the bottom of the world, how do you not fall in the sky???  Checkmate
Your presentation and commentary are entertaining and well-spoken.  Even if something isn't quite as you might like it, you are still congenial.  Always a pleasant vicarious trip to go on.  Thanks for showing us who will not go anywhere to the caliber you do how things are.  Truly appreciated.
Do you get to keep all of those first class PJ's?........if so, you must have a garage full of pajamas. Lol
Hope you at least kept the lap belt on like a responsible passenger.
Is there Chinese on the top right at 1min 25? nice!
Was looking for a Qantus review from you a few weeks back. Glad to see you heard me through the ether 😂
Awesome vid mate!  Bite the end off of each side of the TimTam and use it as a straw for your coffee.  It's messy but yummy.
10k a trip where you can travel 10 times to different countries.
👍💐🎉🇨🇦
Nevermind the luxury, it always blows my mind to think a whole bar and lounge is flying up there.
I love your vids. Why not have a separate stream of vids on the actual destinations? It looks like a cruise is the only way you Chillax!😊
When you’re served any type of fish/seafood…it literally makes me want to hurl my guts out….😊
That steak is not medium rare! Its not even remotely pink
I’ve actually googled, asking why you always wear NASA gear. Lol
Hi Will!! I am a huge fan. As a Aussie I hope you enjoyed our country down under. Love your videos cheers buddy 😊
Your subs gonna hit 1M by end of this year. So happy for u, it's all yr harrdwork & u deserve it william ❤
I love watching your videos and I happen to work as a guide at NASA’s JSC in Houston, if you ever find yourself there I would be delighted to give you a tour!!
YAAAYYYY WELCOME DOWN UNDER BRO!!!!😂😂😂❤❤❤😊😊😊
What cabin luggage do you use? I've only flown economy to Sydney, I'd love to try business
Tim Tams though :D McVities chocolate penguins does a better job.
@Trek Trendy: Thank you for making and sharing these traveling videos.  I really enjoy them.   I kindly request that you please do resort (even all inclusive resorts) and hotel review videos. I would be interested in seeing those kind of videos. Also, please create more solo videos where you are the only one being featured. Sometimes it's nice to see your father and Millie, but I mainly prefer you to be featured only. It comes across more professional that way and it's as if you are the host of a traveling show.
What’s the point of the library in the lounge. How you gonna read a book before boarding
Top quality once again thanks Will. I have to admit to always watching your videos twice: once as a viewer to enjoy the content, then a second time as a fellow ‘tuber to deconstruct, analyse, and generally be in awe of the production process. All the best mate 👍
I’d rather fly Singapore airlines in the Suites.
You really complaining about the flimsy menu…bruh that’s sad. U sound like a kardashian
Great videos. Just wondering, you must get tired between these gigantic voyages between your videos. Whats your downtime like?
Hope it was a flight to remember. As I recently flew with quantos I must say it was the worst flight I’ve ever been on. Flew from London to Perth Ona Dreamliner and never again. For such a long haul flight the stewardesses only came round twice on an 18 hr flight to offer eats. The food was absolutely disgusting and the blankets they gave us were smelly I couldn’t use mine it was so bad. So I ended up frozen to the bone. Yes this was economy class never again . This airline I must say is the worst ever
Loved the video, although I am concerned at the excessive amount of Vegemite you placed on your toast 😂. Remember, a thin scraping is all you need.
One day some airline will do a non stop London - Sydney flight using the shortest route over the Arctic.  BOAC experimented with it in the 60's using a Super VC10 but with extra fuel tanks in the hold and the extra weight meant that only 50 or 60 passengers could be carried, never went commercial as would have been too expensive even for the super rich at the time who would often go by ship for the luxury. Paying that price I would have expected leaf tea in a pot not a teabag.
An interesting flight and description of your journey!  Looks like a good way to travel that distance!  Thanks for the journey!  Hope you shared your TimTams with Millie!
Both great bikes look forward to seeing you both doing your breakfast adventure rides.🙂
Have it just seen a repeat of where you are sitting?
What a great video! Love your stuff. Thanks!
What Timbs do you own?
When are you coming to south Africa my brother?
Sorry mate  but Veggiemite is absolutely NOTHING like Marmite !!!!!
I miss Millie!
I wish I had the money to fly like this once!
Looks more like business class than first class tbh
Hello Trek trendy I am from Pakistan  🇵🇰  I watching your channel for 3 years I Iove your channel very much !
Thank you for sharing this long flight.
@ 5:40 Boot the Tims* off
Apologies...im lost...isnt Aukland further away?  but its half the price???
rather poor design in Q 1st class: no privacy, no shower, no bar....(but yet nice)
It's a long journey, 24 hours of flight, apparently comfortable having spent it in the first class suites. For a level playing field, he should return to economy and then describe the differences. I send you a warm greeting
whats the deal with Nasa?
Pretty special Will
Sydney to London is $10k? Auckland to London is $5k? I bet Sydney to auk is <<<<<<$5k?
I agree always book a seat/pod on the left...
Today I'm going to outer space
He my brother come to india 😅
I never thought I would find a YouTube channel that makes flying on an airplane so interesting and fun to watch! These videos are great, Will. Keep it up!
Amazing ! love this, from Algeria <3
Lol I love the cheeky moments when you use the selfie stick and people get in the frame 🙂, Hi Millie 🙂!!!!!, and great vid as usual, 😊👋🙌🍾🍾🍾
Люблю икру в самолёте 😊
Space you can’t get in economy but good you can bring for $10k 😀
It is nuts that you can fly 29 hours in first class (Auckland), having steak and champagne, for only about 2k more than a RT 5 hour flight in business class in Canada.
I guess Emirates A380 is the only one which gives high quality air travel
You're in your 30's please stop saying "Tim's" or "dc" it takes no more syllables to say diet coke... Do sent make you cool... Ps... You can buy nasa gear in tesco... You ain't cool... Melt
What deck are you on
Safe travels. Thanks for this vlog. Have an amazing day. Cheers.
I am 80 years old, the jimmyjam 830 spiffyboffy EXj(4322 splazzy plots can be synchronised to spliff niggy haggy plumb bobbikins, makes more sense than your advert. 😁
Отличное авиа путешествие с  повышенным комфортом и изысканной едой! Спасибо за видео! Новых дорог!
Why do you speak American English?
Been watching your vids for a while, the editing recently has really taken a step up. Give your editor a raise! (Or, if you edit your own videos, treat yourself to more caviar)
Another really enjoyable video. I'm curious about finding tickets that start at another destination. Are there common routes that people know about to circumvent the price? Aka the Aukland vs Sydney starting point? I'm always amazed at how often the AV influencers know about these. Or do you just spend a lot of time online searching?
Been nice flying with you,thank you for the video xx
Must be nice to have the money to do it wall of Us mere mortals have to sit there and watch his videos makes me sick
I hate that it’s pronounced “Quantas” but it’s spelled without the letter “U”, I’d think it would be “Kon-Tas”.
He has to try the Perth to London direct flight atleast once !
Love how you dress on first class.. hoodie, cheap shues and watch.  That was ironic 😂
I also start my day with two glasses of champagne before i get into my package transporter.
Not a fan of the layout/interior, business class on qatar q suite looks better than 1st class here. Expected much more on a iconic long route, great vid nonetheless
Shame this video was aimed at the American Market and not multinational using a range of different currencies, like you usually do, which is strange as you're English flying from Australia to UK.
Exciting to watch your wonderful video from Ohio USA.   I will never get to do this.  Thank you so much for sharing with us so we can see what it's like.   Safe flying ✈️✈️
Vegemite is the best and living in sydeny every teip is a long trip 😢
You came here aww man
I cant believe you were just in Sydney
I’m sure you have been asked this a lot, but why do you wear only NASA shirts/hoodies?
I chose to sit on the Right side as the middle aisle pax would not then face towards your direction
Dilmah tea, it's a Sri lankan product 🇱🇰
I happened to come across  this by accident and just loved your manner, so continued watching.  I've done economy sydney London return twice. And it's horrid. I loved that tip from NZ!!  awesome idea!     I just loved the way you explained things, and love you enjoyed vegemite😁 thanks for your video
For first class and the money spent,  the food is sparse and nothing special.  From what I saw.
Long time boss
I’m doing the same flight in August this year just a class lower then you
Bingo
Nice! to the place I live! (england)
I think you are very good and I travel all over the world with you. But....I'm old enough to be your Grandmother so please, please, between mouthfuls, would you mind putting your cutlery back on the plate and not hold it in your hands with your wrists resting on the table. Pedantic? Yes. Old fashioned? Yes. Manners maketh the man!!
A380 is the best .
This video was really enjoyable, keep it up!
What's the obsession with Tim Tams, they are just rebranded Penguins.
Another great review! Glad you enjoyed flying the roo. Not the most amazing hard product compared to middle eastern carriers but delivered in a casual and classy way suited to the Aussie way of life.   Question: Was the tasting menu not offered on the Sydney to Singapore leg?
No amenity kit?
What’s up with your Never A Straight Answer get up ? 🤷
pay $10k to sleep on an airplane. need your damn head examined.
I hope you had the deconstructed pavlova in the lounge!
Really honoured to have you sir
Where do you find these deals? I'm a QF member with nearly 1 mill points when I look at business one way to LA from Sydney they quote me 15k aud. What am I doing wrong.
no doors in fc?
As an Australian, I love how you reviewed one of Australia's most iconic airline.
Crazy... 10k is litterarly more than i pay in rent per year (incl electricity).
Love seeing these luxurious experiences. One day I will get to do something like this I am sure. If it were me, I would have definitely had the massage in Sydney before the flight.
These are great videos but I desperately wish the fine gentleman could pronounce words that start with 'th' *gaaaah* 'firty fousand feet'
Cool to see you fly in our aussie plane and that you love Vegemite  (great for hangovers)
Hi everyone
Guys, please help some of us. How do you guys manage to do such great exploits USD10k USD5k etc etc... whilst some of us struggle through..
Idk but imo this seat is scam it is too much similar to business class product
Plant-based options! So refreshing to see. I flew Qantas gold class in 2018 (I'm vegan), all I could eat were the bread rolls - and drinks.
I genuinely love watching these videos, but I really think they'd benefit from being less scripted and monotonous. The language is identical for all videos and sounds mechanical. I think it's because it's read from a written script.
Wombat kola bear baby kangaroo, i love Australia, dont you love it too
Great review and I always look forward to your reviews.
Thanks for showing me 3A. Ive flown in 66A on qantas to London, Dallas and Los Angeles. I find the extra couple of hundred for an exit row is good enough for a battler from western sydney.
For the price, this didn't seem worth it. Seems more like a high end average experience than a true luxury one like the ones given by Singapore airlines etc.
Flew First Class in the QANTAS A380 Melbourne to Dubai in 3A. Felt like the only person on the flight. Very enjoyable.
I flew on the airline in first class on i think the same plane
Glad to see Qantas still treats some of their customers semi decently. For the rest of us non first class travellers these days you can consider it an exceptional Qantas flight if it’s not cancelled (it will probably still be hours late)and your baggage isn’t lost. It’s pretty disgusting how bad Qantas has got, prices keep going up (got to pay the billionaire ceo his millions in bonuses after all) and standards and services have dropped dramatically. Domestically most of their planes no longer have wifi or any on board entertainment and the food is some stale biscuits and plastic cheese or maybe some pretzels
A very comfortable way to travel, for sure, but if I was going to spend 10k on something like this I think some Middle Eastern carriers offer more luxury for your money. For example: greater suite privacy, larger IFE screen, wider menus, dine on demand, larger bathrooms, possibly a shower, etc. I’d happily review the options if any airlines would like to get in touch 😉🤣
You love DC and Vegemite?! We might just make you an honorary Aussie now! 😂🇦🇺
Did you get to keep the pyjamas and slippers?
$10,000 and a remote that does not work.  You did it Qantas. You lead.
Cant believe the IFE monitor is so small for the size of the seat/suite. Only thing that looked sub par.
Great to see you in Australia again and flying Qantas. From an Aussie.
Ciao bello! do you work for Nasa?
Good video ❤️👌❤️🇮🇳
It sucks how it’s cheaper to fly to nz then leaving from Australia
Definitely wanna see you fly AKL-JFK or JFK-AKL on Air New Zealand's route!
Neil perry
Clearly NO MATCH with Emirates or Qatar.. Cattle class is same tho across all three.
Another great video will. As an Aussie love this Qantas video. Ant chance you could do a shout out to dom.and madi also big fans of yours that just got married 😀
Wow! Most of the food looked great!
Its not a direct flight if you stop for refueling and tech stuff
for 10,000 seat, you get a broken remote?
Hi trek trendy can I give a recommendation fir a videoing flying aer lingus buissnues class I feel like there isn't alot of videos about it
This looks so much nicer than my 26hr Sydney to London in economy
Had the same experience at hte onboard lounge. Totally deserted. No one showed up after hanging out there two hours. They didn't stock much in the self serve snack area either. Start contrast to my experience at the emirates bar which was a full on party. The space is nice and you can still get service with the call atteandant buttons, guess they just don't advertise it. Even the flight attendant was shocked when i used the button saying he never knew one was even there hah. Such a wasted product. Needs better advertising and properly stocked self service amenities for when the FAs are busy.
@Trek Trendy i have a question what is more better air france la première or Emirates first class
Can you make a review about garuda Indonesia boeing 777-300 er please
I might be Greek but by Qntas is my favorite airline, i was praying to try them a lot of months
One item that astonishes me about QANTAS international flights is the lack of wi-fi. For a ten grand ticket, it feels inexcusable.
Love the video! But I genuinely don’t know how you are able to afford all of these luxury flights and trips! Is it all affiliated?
Much prefer your videos to Sam chui's, they feel much more natural and authentic
Your videos are the reason why i want to travel ! thank you for this one, already planning an itinerary !!
Doing this flight on Wednesday but in premium economy,can’t wait.
High TT, happy that you are so positive about dear old Q. The A 380 has to be one of the best way to fly between our countries in either F or J. Have you considered coming back in one step on the B 787 . This is a great flight without any stops apart from a BQQ in Perth for a refuel. Trust you will coming back?
Trek trendy fuming that his menu is made from card is quite funny
Not commented before on your videos (which I love) but the quality of the videography & narration is better than anything a BBC team with a ludicrous budget could put together & is the reason I delight in paying for YouTube premium!
Fun Fact: I have seen one of the original Kangaroo Route planes nicknamed 'Connie' in real life. It's crazy how only a month later, I see this video.
I love your videos. I would really like to know what brand of carry-on luggage you use. As for food, I would’ve chosen  Capsicum Soup,Chicken breast, Onion soup,Beef fillet,Ginger cake,Pancakes and sausages. Australia is on my bucket list.
He's probably having the best job in world..able to travel and meet different people in different countries and living the luxe life which most of us cant afford..oh well we can just watch n dream about it.
Can’t you go to sweden❤❤❤
Certainly the best way to fly between Oz and UK
I would think they could at least make the walls go to the ceiling on something like a 10k first class trip but flying for that amount of time definitely puts the price into perspective compared to the product
As an Australian it is an honour to have you in our country!
😌 ahh now we're missing South Africa
people still fly qantas? amazing
It’s really cool that you fly on the same A380 in 24 hrs, with it being slightly a nonstop 24hr trip. I think that lounge in Australia is neat cause of how low the ceiling is & the panoramic views of the tarmac.
When u think of it this flIght was quite cheap because he flew ana from America to Japan for 10k to so that mean first class on Qantas maybe quite affordable
I was about to ask myself when his gonna do a long haul
One of my jobs in Australia was to restructure the Vegemite plant in Port Melbourne.  Vegemite is not Australian, it is American.  Kraft tried to market  it in the southern US but this wasn't a success so they decided to market it in Australia as an Aussie product and generations of Australians fell for the pitch.  Basically it is the yeast dregs from the brewing process. After working as a management consultant and inhaling yeast fumes for 6 months, I never ate Vegemite again.  here is an ad for the black ointment.  Notice that at no time does Kraft say: Vegemite is Australian but the implication is there.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5r3HAJh8es
Top quality video as always
Thank you for your videos! They really create dreams that I hope will some day come true. Just flew from Stockholm to Helsinki yesterday. That would make a very short video: "The plane went up... The plane landed". On a clear day, it is actually a really beautiful flight over the sea.
Love your videos, but it still wasn’t clear to me why a first class passenger had to disembark for an hour halfway through the flight, schlepping his own luggage. Did everyone have to disembark with their carry ons? How odd. Where were they supposed to go? What if people were sleeping? Did they wake everyone up and tell them to get off the plane? I’m still confused. Or did you just have the opportunity to explore a little for fun and it wasn’t mandatory?
ARE YOU SPONSORED BY COKE ? You keep showing the coke crap all the time?
First class fabulous! I flew that route in December 2019 on the A380...such a long flight. Was in economy. Just loved Australia!
Great to hear you love vegemite.  The suite on the A380 has been much improved since I flew 12 years ago.
"Help with the jet lag"  LMAO thats the first I've ever heard of this for any alcohol XD  Jokes aside, Qantas' First Class offering truly does look outstanding! Certainly something to consider if and when I head to Australia on holiday!
you paid by cash?? 10k?? not miles? Thanks
I really want to know what you do for your day job, to be able to afford these kinds of flights. Because I'm pretty sure Opera doesn't sponsor enough for a 10k flight. I could be wrong, though.
Great, fair review. QF not perfect, but very good. Beats those hysterical queenlike "nonstopdan" videos hands down, they're just silly clickforcash YouTube titles, s(he is continually disappointed at minor service issues before the airlines is categorized as a 'disaster etc.
brits out of Australia
5:40 Hey Will, another class video and great trip onboard QF1, love the fact that it stops in Changi, such an amazing airport.   On to the serious stuff though, your bingo card is missing a chocolate based dessert, can you update it please 😂 thanks also for continuing to mention the bingo, makes me laugh every time, how long have we been discussing it now 😁   Great filmography one more 👌
Most Australians I know fly Emirates
Not anywhere near Qatar first class  looks more like an upgraded business  class
I am a proud Aussie & so very pleased that Qantas didn't let you down.  Also 10/10 for loving vegemite which is a staple in my diet & I am ever so happy that they now have a gluten free option from Kraft so that I don't have to miss out.  I still think it was much nicer in the 1950s before they started dropping the salt content & now it has a short shelf life, however mine never goes out of date as I like it too much!! p.s.  I also love marmite & when I visited the UK in 1987 it was a staple whilst there & one I bought home with me.  Though my biggest love was clotted cream!! I miss that so much...
Ripped jeans have no place in a first class lounge no matter how much you paid for the ticket. Frankly, they should have denied you entry given your unkept appearance.
Yessss!!! I've waited all day til I got off work tok watch the show. My favorite traveling YouTube creator.. just awesome@!!@
I feel at this point that "feeling a million bucks" from a shower should be on the bingo card.
As a vegetarian who detests mushrooms I couldn’t help but notice that mushrooms are included in all but one of the plant-based meal options. At that price point I hope you can still request it without mushrooms  Thanks for another great video  👍👍
Is this an ad? I quite enjoyed a few of your videos but these look more and more like paid advertisement... 9:20 to 9:27... beef cooked to perfection? You asked for medium rare and that looks well done yet you still said cooked to perfection... if that's not paid advertising I don't know what is!
24 hours... is still 24 hours.
Nine hours of sleep?!  Amazing!
Some people have too much money
Back with another great video!! 🔥🔥 keep up the first class reviews i love them!!
Great video, again, and excellent taste in Vegemite! Auckland departs are always cheaper in my experience.- I spent four years (2016- 2020) travelling between Auckland and the UK (Birmingham and Heathrow) four return flights each year.  Keep up the good work!
I would expect first class to handle your carry on.
I can see why they put the "party space" in the front of the upper deck considering the first class seats are in the front of the lower deck and in the rear of the upper deck is premium economy
So glad your experience with Qantas was such a good one.
No 1who is Aussie   believes that Vegemite is the same as Marmite!!!!!
Fantastic video!  How do you keep your WHITE NASA sweatshirt so clean during the meals?  It still amazes me.  I'm looking forward to flying this a380 in the future!
I thought the A380’s had showers onboard
Nice
I always love the  videos.
Thank you for taking me along on something i will never get to do. May i also share, my father the pilot told us to always keep seat belt on in your seat. Clear air turbulence and after seeing those pics of the flight going to Germany can certainly see what he was concerned about. So please keep your belt on so we can continue wonderful adventures with you!
What model are those Timberlands?
You need to try Lemon and Ginger tea ... I drink it just about every day I have the opportunity.
Will ..I just love these almost as much as the train vids😊
Enjoyed seeing that first class. Very modern and bright and the food looked great
why don't you come to india
Thank you!
seriously, how do you afford this? are you the CEO of Nasa or something?
I've been looking forward to a new upload ❤❤❤❤
I watch this channel because it’s nice to share these experiences about things I’ll never be able to afford 😂
Absolutely love your vids, they are awesome. But why are you wearing a NASA wanker hoodie?
That was just awesome!
sooooo... do you get to keep the slippers?
Looking good man!
Qantas Should Start Flight To North East India From Australia With Boeing 787 AirCraft ❤❤❤
I have recently in the last six months found your videos and I’m hooked  Seen them all binge all of them and always look forward to a new one So I’m exciting for this
Woot woot! Another banger video!
Well if you absolutely have to fly 24 hours this is a very nice way to do it.
I noticed the stop in Karachi.  Pakistan international airlines used to have  Pan Am standards. The first emirates planes were gifts from Pakistan.  It is so sad to see a former aviation hub reduced to what Karachi airport is today.
I wonder why he calls his shoes "tim's..."
I can't imagine taking this flight in economy. Even in business class this is a hard flight.
Safe travels treky:)
What kind of nutcase opts for diet coke when coke zero is right there...
How do I know all your finances?  Will find out - no mercy on any of u
And without the help of anyone - like here half of the country is involved- and I ll find out who is helping them there.
I am so confused: Why is it half the price from Auckland even though you fly a longer distance if you start there?
Strange question.. can you taist the difference in the diet coke around the world
So why DOES Trek Trendy always wear items with the NASA logo ?
What model of Timberland’s are they?  Nice looking pair of shoes!  👍
Loving your plane review videos. An entire trip vlog with plane, hotels, restaurants, activities would be EPIC.
This video brought back some good memories of the same flight and lounge experiences I had a few years ago with Qantas. Very enjoyable experience.
Would there happen to be any internet connectivity included with the first class fare? It seems that sending a few emails or chat messages during such a long flight would make it a bit less lonely.
Look at Mr. Trendy zooming past all the other aviation vloggers with 680k subs,  soon to be over 700k in record time! Well done Will, you deserve it. You are like no other for sure!❤️✈️
Has Qantas still never crashed? (Rainman reference) 😉
God I wanna be rich 😂 until then I'll  just keep watching ur videos 😅
Putting Marmite on par with Vegemite? Them's fightin' words! :D
It’s not really iconic because the route is quite recent
cheap toothpaste
your need to review online fitness programs the same way
Planes are a bummer cuz you can’t see if you can fit in the top bunk
awesome!
Egg and chips my choice
I can’t believe that price difference you talked about at the end!    For shame - had you got the cheaper ticket leaving from Auckland you could’ve brought Millie along with you and tried that awkward buddy seat dining experience in 3A!
How far in advance do you book a flight like this?
At least he had a glass of water the entire flight 🤣
😎👍
Upgraded from business using Qantas F F points. Great customer service and my wife and I enjoyed the luxury. Go for the complementary massage at Syd First lounge. The squid is a classic Niel dish. On board I was asked if my wife would be joining me for dinner using the extra seat. I said No. I asked the crew member Did you ask my wife ? His answer yes sir . What was her reply No sir. We both burst out with giggles and was the start of an awesome trip. Ow the young woman who said to her friend Not as good as Emirates. Well fly blooming Emirates then.
To be honest after viewing so many business & first class flights of other airlines.  I feel that first class on Qantas looks like business class to other airlines.  Singapore, Etihad, Emirates and Qatar. To name a few.
Love your videos, and living vicariously through your adventures. I would love to see you do a series on the Aman Resorts. Definitely bring Millie!
I'm always surprised you pernounce "Privacy" like an American, vs the English way.
Why do you keep wearing Nasa clothing 🤨
I still don’t get it, I’ve flown on a bunch of one stop flights and never had to get off while they made a stop. What was the story there?
He's first class before flight like england ✈️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
I love your disappointment with the flimsy menu.  If I spent $10k I’d say the same thing.
“Why does TrekTrendy where NASA clothing?” 😂😂😂 so funny
WHY do you always say the price in $$$$$$ your English say it in £££££
done this journey so many times squashed in economy, hopefully one day I'll get to do it first class. 🤞
I would love the comfort, but the food is beyond my tastes! 😂
You really seem to enjoy champagne 🤣
production quality has improved a lot in the last 6 months. Good job will!
I love your videos mate great job I live in Australia and this video is a perfect example of what Australia's airport has to offer
What a lovely trip, that was a great flight!
Keep up the good work
Is it just me or did they not dim the lights on a take off on the second leg!!!!
I was interested to see in these comments someone interested in seeing Norwegian cruise experiences.  I should very much enjoy a review of one of Hurtigruten's cruises of which I have heard good reports.
Another excellent video. Odd question here. What is the make and model of your watch?
I hate traveling but by enjoying traveling first class vicariously through your video, it makes for an excellent diversion from the madness of my "real life".  Thank you for such a great video!
There F class isn't anything special relative to the competition.
i've been using opera for 20 years or something i dont have the ai prompt where is it
The real question is, have you done a Tim Tam Slam?
I would have made all the same selections as you, except for dessert where I would have gone for the ice cream or chocolates.
My wife and I were supposed to fly QF F coming back from our honeymoon SYD-LAX... until they swapped the plane down to a 787 and had to bump us to J :(  certainly glad to see the experience we missed out on here on the channel but still can't help but feel a bit bummed.
You could do with a new pair  of jeans.
Why do you always wear a NASA shirt or button?
Having been to Singapore Airport previously, and seeing it again in this video reminds me of just how ugly the carpet is there! It looks like an outdated carpet design from the 70's!
I see the menu, say to hubby...he will choose the beef..10 seconds later...LOL
You slept a bit too much  through the review, felt like i missed a lot of the flight although really do enjoy your vixeos
A great review as always but I WOULDN"T flight QANTAS if you gave me a free ticket.  They have proven that that they have gone down hill since their current CEO took over!!!!
The dreaded long haul Sydney to London looks so much more palatable in First Class. Thanks for the tip about flying from Auckland.
As an British/Australian citizen who doesn’t like Tim tams or Vegemite I found your choice of duty free and breakfast spread very amusing😂.Neil Perry is the chef who’s responsible for the menus on Qantas he has restaurants in Sydney & Melbourne. Looks like a very comfortable way to fly back to my homeland but I still prefer to do this route on Singapore airlines as it isn’t offered from Brisbane where I live, so you code share on Emirates. I don’t see the point in adding a domestic flight south to Sydney and then flying north again. Thanks for sharing glad you had a great flight ❤️👏👍
Great video your channel is luxury channel and we can enjoy like in first class watching your videos
Please try out air NZ / Thai airways surely x
Excellent job mate. You have the best first-class videos.  I learn so much watching your videos.  Thanks for sharing your experience.
Great video as always. Flights like this never seem to last long enough for me!
Okay so I am not new to the channel, but I keep forgetting to ask about the NASA fascination. Anyone care to enlighten me? TIA lol
Your dedication to flying is mind blowing and idk how anyone would be able to do what u do so well
Half price from Auckland then Sydney WTF= Q & Taz
My son really wants to know what model Timberlands those are
thats nice but not 10k nice.
Looks nice, but Emirates & Singapore First is in a different league….menu choices also look way off the mark for First Class as does the seat/space…
Bro which model of Timba it’s that ? As i’m looking for them since long time and can’t find them 🤷🏼‍♂️ great review as always bro!
sourdough bread, gnocchi, snapper, and pudding , it all looks good
I've done that same journey a couple weeks back, however I travelled cattle class. Interesting to see glimpses of Sydney Airport where I was and then the parts I had no access to.
Was a shower during your layover in Singapore on the bingo card because I knew that was your first stop at Changi? 😂
where do you get the NASA apparel from mate? love the vids!
My first thought was to look for well-dressed people performing Inception on someone.
Great trip report! I’m super excited for Qantas to inaugurate their non stop flight to London from Sydney! What a special day it’ll be. What’s the name of the background music? 10:55
Looks more like an emirates business class imo
Great video and the flight looked very nice but not quite at the level of other 1st class options, especially with that kind of price tag (retail of 10K dollaredoos?!)
What a waste of money
Flew that last month, EK back. Best of both worlds. QF has the better suite, EK does the glam (and the shower).
Keep up the good work but a little more often as I get withdrawal symptoms when there is none to watch 😂 Hope ypu and Mille are well ? Would it be possible to get both of your Autographs please.
Celtic 1-0 Rangers.
I love the new Qantas safety video (I say new but they started it just before COVID happened). I never knew you could do Sydney to London, I always thought the only direct flight from Aus to London was Perth to Heathrow.
I wonder if in 20-30 years they will offer nonstop flights with economy bunk beds. No fancy meals, no fancy seat, just a cozy bed and an IFE, would make travel around the world so much more enjoyable.
Hey, welcome to Australia, finally you have done a trip I have, although I was at the other end of the aircraft, & I left from Brisbane in Queensland. It's interesting to see it's cheaper from New Zealand ?, that would be an epic flight, I hope you did something fun while you were over here, cheers.
Which camera do u use
airplane bars remind me of hotel bars, they are there mainly for show and pictures but usually empty and not really a good investment.
Love the videos
I’ve watched a few of these today and must say that I honestly feel full from all that food.
Qantas lounge needs work as that's not even a proper coffee machine
Suggestion:  Australia to London (Perth-london)
GREAT VIDEO BUD 👍👍
The dividing partition across the aisle must have been broken as the Flight Attendants usually raise that for the middle seats straight after take off. You can see the partition raised on the last row @15:44. People are not usually that exposed. Unfortunately, as an Aussie, I think Qantas are behind the game I’m First these days - much better options on Emirates, Qatar and Singapore Airlines.
Trek trendy I love your videos, I watch them with my mom all the time!!
What's with all the NASA branding??
You should do a Viking cruise down the river in Europe
Always wondered, how much have you flown with Qantas? since I've seen you have a Q Bag Tag on your carry on :P
you know it will be a good day when you wake up to a trek trendy video
Keep it up Mate! Love these videos and have been watching for 2 years! Love your reviews! 🎉
A double DC bingo trip. You are spoiling  us Will!
Been on the Qantas A380 first class a few times now and never fails to impress, especially when it’s straight to work upon landing.
Finally aviarion, what I am here for <3
With all the cocktails & champagne you drink how are you not drunk the entire flight?  Are you allowed to keep the slippers and sweats that are provided for you?
Im Australian and Australia is beautiful come visit again
Qantas is such an amazing airline and deserves to be reviewed more often. Fantastic content as always. Keep it up.
So how many air miles points did you use?
This has to be the most pretentious channel on Youtube. Don't recommend this crap to me.
Always love watching the vintage Qantas safety video! Ohhh, and thanks for the tip on getting a half price 1st class ticket, good to know!
You eat waaaaay too much red meat. Try some other mains on occasion!
I don't think Qanatas first class, even lives up to Qatar's business class.
Hope you didn't miss tasting Australia's best food export on that flight.  The Pepa Saya Butter!
I really want visit Australia but can’t afford business or first and can’t bear the thought of economy for that length of time
10:04 remote unresponsive? No problem!
E' un viaggio lungo, 24 ore di volo, confortevole a quanto pare per averlo trascorso nella first class suites. Per par condicio , dovrebbe fare il ritorno in economy per poi descriverci le differenze. Le invio un caro saluto
I don’t know what it is about these videos but they’re so relaxing and extremely enjoyable to watch, Over the past year or so you’ve turned me into a train and aeroplane fan. Awesome videos 👍🏻
gotta do a what's in my bag video sometime :)
It's totally un accesable to the average person even earning relatively good money in the UK. I'm not sure many of us have £10,000 to burn on a first-class ticket. However, it was a great video nice to see how the other half live 😅😂
Treky mate, can you please make a Celebrity or Princess or Norwegian premium suite cruising experience video.  Literally, nobody is making those!! You are basically the only one with the premium suite Virgin Voyages review/video.  I think those are the more attractive  premium cruises to people of ALL ages as opposed to the likes of Viking that attract mostly seniors.  Thank you so much for all of the awesome content.
I've been watching your videos for about a year. Your editing, videography, story telling though your eyes as if we were there, is amazing. I always look forward to your uploads. Kindest regards, Richard U.K
Not dressing up for first class is reflects badly on you. As a man you should do better.
I wish I was Rich than do that ):
Thanks for your videos. That's fun to watch! Please show us the spa's and the amenities that are provided on flights and in the spa's. Greetings from Germany
Great as usual. What a long sleep on a plane!! 🙂🙂
I’ve been waiting for a video like this for a while
Early/loyal subscriber. Can't get enough of the content (especially the aviation/cruises)! <3
A floppy menu. Bless you!!!
When you experience issues in other videos you have been more vocal about them. Like remote control not working and lack of privacy, especially on a $10000 flight. Qantas has been getting some poor feedback of late so did they sponsor this video?
Booting off the Tim-Tams... 😉 Will, in which month did you film the last video (the Canadian train trip)? Oh, and I can totally vouch for your sponsor Opera - their mobile browser is also brilliant.
How £10,000 that must have really set you back
Pretty soon, no visitors to Middle East hubs when Americans, Europeans, and Australians bypass them.
Most impressed by the nine hours of sleep you had. I don’t even sleep that well in my own bed 😂
Tim Tams..just the best especially dunked into a cuppa!! Fantastic as always.  Cant believe its so much cheaper to fly that complete journey from NZ and im guessing youre talking US$? Enjoy those Tim Tams 😊😊
Great, but less poseur shots of yourself would be grand!
i'd kill for these vids to be in 4k
NIC
Power trip! 👏
Who flies first with their couples….how was your jetlag?
Wearing a hoodie in first class.
First time I've ever watched through a sponsorship. Amazing content as always, i'm an avgeek and a first class virgin, hope to lose it soon ;)
G'Day Will. Enjoyable flights and the food was pleasing this time for me.
Tablecloth could do with a quick iron running over it 😂
Superb 👍😉💪
いつも、リッチな動画、ありがとうございます🥰キュナードのクイーンメリー2のスイートの動画って、有りました❓
Man you won’t know how long I’ve been waiting for a kangaroo flight review 😂😂 Please do it with the A350 when they come into service! Love the vids keep it up.
Fantastic video
What is it about your videos just calms me down? 😅 Keep on doing what you do best 💪
It’s awesome to see you fly a new and different airline to the usual such as emirates as it gives a nice unique and fresh look to premium products of other airlines such as Aussie airlines😊
glad to see a dedicated vegetarian menu - as a vegetarian, i'm often surprised at how many of the luxury experiences on your channel have few to no vegetarian options!
No one eats and drinks like this? I love your videos but you have this cocky attitude about you.  And no one wears the same clothing (Nasa) line every video.
Great start to a Monday with your reviews :D Tim Tams in duty free are ridiculously expensive I just got mine from the supermarket
I think u & Mill R fat enough, would you not say?😂
*Have NEVER been to Australia* !! *Would like to visit* !! *Glad that Qantas is a GREAT airline* !!  *Qantas First Class is WAY out of my budget* !!  *Thanks for taking us w/you* !! *Looks like a FUN way to fly* !!  #TrekTrendy
Lovely video x
awseome
So my oldest friend and I are planning on having one of those trips of a lifetime.  My dream was to fly first class just once.!! So we have been madly watching your videos, which a fabulous I might add.  Being an Aussie I feel like I should fly Qantas, but you have offered up so many wonderful options.  I am so confused now!!  Keep up that hard work you do!! And soon I will be able to fulfil a life long dream.  Thanks Dan.
Seems they need some more customers on the fights,it looked quiet? Seat config like Air NZ biz? Well done keeping your white top white (not sure I would be that successful!).Thanks
Are you an astronaut at NASA?
With the NASA shirts you always wear , you need to get yourself a Omega Moonwatch
Great video as always ! But if I’m flying First class Qantas ain’t gonna be my first choice 🤣
Where is Molly?
this is exactly what i needed to wake up this morning, thanks will
старый хулиган!!!
Can't belive we didn't get to see the max n cheese being eaten 😂😂 gutted ahahahaha  Lovely vid tho thank you bro like the new i360 cam footage 😊
Dopamine time! thank you!
YESSS BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!!!
nice video thanks trek trendy
How are you not yet an alcoholic from all that champagne?
Bingo!
Complete with the rudest staff in the world. Fly Singapore Airlines.
I LOVE your videos, please please can you zoom in on the menu I like to read it. Fingers crossed
Glad to see you’ve had a great journey! Love these vlogs. Just wondering - how do you afford all this luxury travel? Is it through sponsors or success?
What timberland shoes are they??
I'll be the buddy for the buddy seat 🙋
Bro has got an infinite money glitch 💀💀💀
Ahh can the day get any better with a trek trendy and nonstopdan upload in one day.
I think you drink as much champagne as I drink Pepsi 😅
The Sydney first class lounge is a big favourite of mine, love the great views of the apron and the food!
#earlysquad
H😮
I was first
Can we all appreciate how high quality his videos are
So I found you’re channel about a week and a half ago, and I’ve already watched every single train video and plane video. And let me tell you I am obsessed with these kind of videos. Keep it up man!
Oh yeah nice to hear “today” and i can’t believe this video was uploaded 1 minute ago lol
Can we take the moment to appreciate the time and effort will is an amazing youtuber!!
Always exited to see a new vid! Honestly the only good traveling channel on Youtube!
Love a discreet check-in 😅
.
As an Australian, it is awesome to see you visit Australia, and fly aboard the Qantas fleet.
Hi! Thanks you for flying Qantas! I was waiting for another video about this and you made it thanks!! ❤😝 Btw I love your vids
Perfect treat for a rainy quiet day in Chicago! Greetings bro! ✌️
Damm Will that is awesome!  That is how you do it right flying from one side of the world to the other.  Very cool!
Yeas!! Thanks
Opera is the best Browser🥰
Never really heard much on quantas first class Just know they are the safest airline in the sky
1 minute club! (leave a like if you watched this video within an hour of release!) 👇
