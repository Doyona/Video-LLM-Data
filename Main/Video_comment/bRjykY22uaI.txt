What a revenge👏

Morelos thinks he's some kind of superstar let him sit on the bench another 3 matches bring Defoe xx

Wtf is this video 50fps?!
Ianis Hagi good
I don't understand how Rangers fans think they can beat Celtic on Saturday. We are reigning champions and Champions league winners. It's really like men against boys. I'm looking forward to listening to commentary on pure football. My prediction 5-0 to Celtic ☘️🇮🇪⚽️🌈🍀☘️🏆☘️🏆🏆☘️
Two shitty goals hope were better than that on Saturday. 😄
St Mirren gift Morelos a late Christmas present. How many is that he's scored this season now? I'm losing count.
If they play like that against Celtic, they'll get hammered.
踢的还行
Do that on sat alfredo a will love you more. Witch is alot already
Unbeatable League Run For 2020
Well done guys Well done Hagi
Wasn't pretty but very effective well done bears 💪
Mantap kapten
Nice job Rangers !!! important 3p.But I.Hagi is far from his potential! He can become one of the best players in europe on his position if he will playing without fear in 1v1 and fighting a little moor aggressive. Aribo,same world class. All team is strong! Good luck!

Goodwin said "they gave away two soft goals" no ! your players were outplayed by superior opposition.  Wot No penalties 😃
Jim Goodwin looks like the lovechild of Rolf Harris and Colonel Sanders...... I bet fingering chicken isn't his preferred choice.
I don't agree with the last comment, it wasn't a good game in my opinion a deflection & a mistake, St Mirren had a good few chances, better players would've put them away. Certainly not oozing & a display like that against Celtic would be punished..
At least Morelos got one Xmas pressie
eeeeeeeeeee of course, that’s what Freddy needed an easy chance to get his confidence going, now no matter how they try and goad him on Saturday he’ll answer them with the sound of the ball hitting the back of the net
Won’t be long till yer arses collapse again ,most likely on sat when the champs rock up
Can’t wait for the Old Firm clash, a game I never miss and with respect if you love football you never should. Great to see Roofe improving and scoring so constantly. I just hope Morelos, if he plays doesn’t see red! Needs to have his head screwed on correctly. A Leeds fan of 56 years so pleased for Stevie G and the Rangers fans. A win and the title is just around the corner. mot⚽️
Good job morelos come on the rangers
Anyone noticed there ain't many celtic comments on our threads just now? Wonder how that is? Very very strange. Maybe they are all just having some time off the Internet just now 😆
Not Greegs’ finest display today but where did these chances come from?
Funny how they don't show the elbow on Goldson but if it was the other way it would have been repeated more times than the pish you get on the bbc.
Let's see if Obika get banned like morelos did he backed into goldson then elbowed him in the face yellow card just like morelos i canny see the sfa do anything
Flukey deflection and a back pass which was like an og. Better to have it in this game than in a six pointer I guess.
Great job Rangers again 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿💙🤍 Next step: Celtic on Saturday This championship is for Rangers
Jim goodwin has st mirren playing decent on a small budget, think he’d be good at Aberdeen ect
Yyyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaa course.
Gotta feel bad for that defender
Joe Aribo is a real special talent, his ball retention is outstanding along with his vision & passing. If he adds more end product in front of goal he is going to be a superstar. Such a humble guy. 💪
Guess who’s back back again buff is back tell a friend
Steven G will be getting a trophy for the first team💪💪 i think this is just the begining for Steve G but the importantly is got a experience to step at the next Level till become the extraordinary coach
Well done buff. Do that on Saturday and you’ll be my bff.
alfie back scoring finally 🤩
Morelos scoring huge for Celtic game he needs to bang them in then no 1 will catch us as the rest all doing there bit . Roofe Morelos Kent will give there defenders nightmares 🤙🏻
Cmon Alfred u can do it !!!!!
Took Alfie boy long anof to score a goal
Come on the teddy bears
GET IN !!!.  More points, good game, players looking sharp and the talent was oooozing.  I am  buzzing for game 22 🔴⚪🔵
Hagi played decent ,byth pretty good assist.He changed the game, that s why he s an excellent player
Kamara and aribo r some players btw. Hope they back it up on Saturday
Mon the gers
55
They're getting pumped like a cheap gas cooker on Saturday.. roond yeez!!
Another 3pts . Onto the mhanky mhob now👊🔴⚪🔵
🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆✌✌✌✌🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟
Great performance today, now to pump the orcs and send ScumFC into meltdown.
It's good to watch the highlights without commentary & added crowd noise☺
Obika elbow to rangers player 2 games in a row this thug need delt with
Congratulations to Rangers 👍 from Liverpool fan. At least gerrard win even Liverpool drew.
Check all the smelly obsessed on this
ALERT ALERT 🚨 FREDO HAS SCORED🇬🇧
Use are pish rotten man
Quadruple treble never done before Glasgow Celtic are the team ceeemon!
First goal down to poor defending and second was gifted with a bow on top.. St Mirren could have easily scored first too, Celtic will batter rangers on Saturday they’re pish now
Glagowwwws green and white
Caaamonnnn you bhoys in green
Glasgowwwsss green and white!
A deflection and a defensive mistake to beat St Mirren😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Celtic will hammer Rangers* on Saturday
Ranges FC best team in Scotland but have to say the best down south would 100% decimate us... We looked like amateurs...
Another win to Rangers, hopefully we can beat Celtic on January 🔴⚪🔵
Feel your luck has to run out sooner or later. If the ref hadn't been so scared and gave the 3 pens, St Mirren would have won this.
Another win, another step closer. Now let's shut Celtic up in January. And the guy on the tannoy. Couldn't have been less enthusiastic
I Love you so very much Rangers. These tough wins vs Hibs and St M are just as important as any other. On we go to Saturday. 🇦🇺
At least Steve won today!
May as well been st James playing field with that back pass at Morelos goal lol
Got to respect the job good wins doing there St miren have to takt changed since he took over good 3 points should have been same in the cup but leagues what matters
🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Hagi, Aribo and Morelos were pretty good today. Ugly game though !
Another win without being very good. Excellent trait to have when winning titles
Who is Morelos “shooshing” 🤫?   There ain’t nobody at the game.
Good to see alfredo on the scoresheet he works so hard for the club and nothing has went his way this season, good goal from him
💙💙
First 🇬🇧
First
