mann , most of the ppl in these comments dont even hoop like that and they trynna call shi 😂🤦🏽‍♂️
so what no point he cant shoot next
gio looks like he has downs @ 0:28 LMAOOOOOO no wonder bro is ass at ball
It’s hella funny seeing him do all that just to brick
This reminded me of me and my friend Cash is my friend who is strong and can drive and I’m Geo who I got crazy handles and can shoot
who knew one day this dribbler would beat cash lmaaao
Bros akashi from kuroko🤯
Bro locked gio up💀
Just keep one hand low and rip him hes not gonna drive seems like and u could probably could catch up anyways
My man got a triple double in a 1v1
bro don't know what a shot clock is bruh 💀
At 10:37 when Cash defended it, could he just have run that to the hoop and scored? Or do you have to bring it back after getting the ball from the opponent?
He don't even got crazy handles he just spam dribbles 🤣🤣🤣
Plot twist. If they didn’t take a break  Gio would have killed him.
Bros a 2k dribbler😂
I must say that is a strange jumpshot, otherwise I'm not mad at his play style but it's very cheese, wearing down your opponent by making it look like your doing more by than you actually are to intimidate them.
What happened to playing till 16 lol
Diego Espinosa you have to go for a little while the happy birthday July 28 34 seat geek squad m NBA basketball 23 Rivera readier hype 2 Jesser jidel Zack Kara mopi Michelle Jeff Jason Efron Johnny John cash see hype 2 com.
4:00
Gio always look clapped
You would expect he could get to the rack and his lay up game to be on point. I’m a year late maybe gio upped his game and can finish at the rack and respect on the burner
3:57 handles are questionable but jumpshot is🍑
He’s getting better
Cash wet like watta
Wannabe professor.😂
This man got great lungs
Man I thought maybe after all these years cash would have fixed his shot but he still that weird spasm at the end of his shot
I cant believe I just watched this.  Lol
Bro he would actually be good if he just cooled down on the dribbles
Gio wise the greatest basketball player alive
his shoes screech like when a xbox kid dosent win
GIO out here doing cardio
Cash really hit that long bomb right when it mattered most, that Kobe jersey coming up big in the clutch😬😬😬
dude sounds humble why all the hate?
Watching Gio hurts my ears 😂
Gio has a good heart I respect him
Cash missed ten 3 pointers  Cash hits one Cash “WET LIKE WATTAAA”
It’s crazy how much cash improved but gio didn’t
Who's smashing the joysticks?
i got cancer looking at his jumpshot
Dude went to the rack 2 times in one play and still went for a 3 😭
Gio's shot is painful to watch.
Cash just blowing by with 3 dribbles meanwhile home boy just  beating drums with the basketball and making squeaky noises with his shoes
Can’t keep myself from laughing everytime Gio starts dribbling lmfao
He like flight 2.0 but can only travel his way to China
He’s not dribbling fast he’s just moving his feet a lot
bro all that dribbling is nothing, he's just moving his feet fast to look like he dribbling.
@cashnasty just drive every time
lol sheesh cash, sound like a scrub calling wet like water and it doesnt go in, you can't tell if its going in or not?
I want to play gio…for real
if giowise worked with someone that drove to the hoop it would open his whole game up severeal levels. those moves do not mean much when the defender can just stand there and wait for the pullup to block. GG though fellas
Give all glory to Jesus Christ our Lord and savior
Is this kid really on youtube and tiktoc? Wtf is this world coming to like is it because hes funny how he plays or dribbles? Like im mind blown for real
His dribbling skills sell him out tik,tik,tik ,tik tik,tik,tok,tik,tik,tik,tik,tik,tiktok.
I can’t tell if this is a joke or not
Gio sucks
Cash v faze rug
Gio vs Tjass 👀
Gio is such a gio
lmao this dude plays with a tiktok shirt
He didn’t go no where 🥶🥶😂😂😂😂
"He didn't go anywhere" 😆 😆 😆
dang he’s good
Its Okay Tiktoker you should have a Coach
I wonder how many ankles have been snatched by those drop offs on the side of that court.. that shit is a bad design...
Cash worst than him cash ain’t hit a single shot from deep
Cash suck to cause all he can do is drive in he can’t dribble
Gio do unnecessary dribbles he dribble like Kyrie but can’t drive in making him a useless basketball player
All he do is spam dribble
cash: 3 feet away from gio gio: screech screech screech dribble dribble then bricks like...
Don’t hate on gio
Shoes go brrr
Gio needs a coach seriously
Sup
ngl that hair aint getting him know where...
i get he dribbles alot and stuff but he has good sports
Hes not even fast he just movin his feet back and forth
I'd say his main weakness is strength. His dribbling and shooting skills are amazing. If he builds his body more, he'd be crazy good.
my guy gio is playing like the game 3vs3
never saw those posters again lmao
Anyone notice hes only above average in speed but just really good at footwork
e
All he did was shoot
Go in his shoes imagine being bullied theough 5th s d highschool then getting hated through youtube and tiktok
See why u got put most hated cmon now he just trynna use what he got advantage
MY MAN A WHOLE 2K PLAYER. 💀💀💀🙏🏻
Bruh all his moves were useless. Dumb moves. He can’t even go to the basket.👎👎👎👎
Three tippy toes per second lmao
Gio places like its 2k
Gio could be friga
Bro I’ll smoke this kid who is this guy 😣
did anyone else notice that random spark at 9:21
Hate to break it to him but he sucks ngl his handles r good but he has no explosiveness at all
That tiktok shirt makes me cringe
2k play shot irl
This my first seeing this dude wtf is that??? No finisher moves?
He's dribbling normally he just moves his feet fast and dramatically 😂
The Shootingform🤡🤡
This kids the wannabe professor
The dribbling looks dumb but I’m 1000% sure that it requires skill. While I’m not a fan, I can respect it
He's just tap dancin
These boys don't know what is midrange
He a wanna. E proffeser though
Fucking hate Gio Wise dude
Cash literally plays like me there no shame in only layups or getting the backboard
His squeeky shoes make him sound fast, hes not that fast
He literally, goes nowhere, Chucks it Up and just pray it goes in
These guys both suck
he litterlly dribbles for a solid minute moves two inches dibbles for another min and goes for a three like wtf
Bro he isn't even trying to find a opening he is just dribbling in one spot
All that dude got is a simple left right just cause he fast doesn’t mean he’s effective
Imagine playing against the professor
Dance and shoot, dance and shoot. Like he's not bad, and he's sinking 3's, he's got potential. But if you're just gonna back up and shoot...then just shoot lol. Why dance and pretend you're gonna drive to the net when you're just gonna step back and shoot? You can do that in like one or two moves.
“dont hurt him, hes just a kid” *man. fuck them kids bro*
This dude plays like "comp" 2k guards man
You should play professor he is really good at basketball and he’s fast and it actually gets him somewhere
if he dribbled better and didn't just stay in one place he may actually be considered "good" great vid cash!
my guy is spamming the handle buttons
Man said build a tree 🌲
To be honest Gio is dope. This dude is twice his size -- imagine if Gio could post him up, it wouldnt even be close.. lets be honest
that explosion at the beggining was unexpected...
Cash is basically James harden but with a shorter beard
I'm 4 months late but i could hear em shoes squeak for no reason. Nigga ain't doing nothing just useless dribbles 🤔
He needs to work on driving to the hoop more and defense he need some work on.
He’s good
bros camera man is a opp
If Gio moved around while doing handles he could actually be good. But here he just dribbling the ball
What am I even watching...?
his form tho...... e
Basic moves but with stutter steps🤦‍♂️
Stop shooting ur a brick
Cash spam layups witch is g.y
When Cash said "he didn't go nowhere" my mind was like EXACTLY
His dribbling is fast but he doesn’t move and his for is awful
the tittle 😭
Is it just me or he got a weird jumpshot
It’s crazy how much cash has improved over the years
Spamming the right stick in 2k with fatigue off be like
Man acting like play sharps in 2k
Gios handles are great but triggering at the same time
Bruh all those “handles” and didn’t make one successful drive to the basket or create space for himself once???
James harden vs Oubre jr
He got no post game thats the problem
The part when when he tosses the ball into his head and then gets swatted 😂
cash damn bro u been in the lab? those hesi and crosses are looking more controlled. Like the first play, looks real nice
The way he skipped to a sponsor after he missed hahah🤣🤣
He should practice some shooting too 😝
I feel bad for his shoes....
this guy is the master of shot clock violation
Why does the dude look like he sniffed tide pod juice in the intro lmao!?!😂
If you aint breaking ankles with them drible moves its kinda useless its just for show
He just quick, but not enough power.
type of guy to run the shot clock out and then miss
This guys form tho
I swear I haven't seen Gio make a layup yet on the internet.
him vs the profressor
The kid obviously is fast and has incredible cardio but his dribbling is pointless and he can't even use it to drive to the hoop. His shooting is decent but his shot selection sucks.
He dribbles fast at most it seemed faster than normal because we doing the stanky leg or whatever that was
Why does man look like if Kevin hart was normal height
It would be great to see gio vs the professor
Pov* 2k22 and 21
Lol
2k be like
the tiktok kid doesn't know how to hoop
What a useless talent.
The spam dribbler was the one that 5v5ved the stokes twins
That dude is cracking me up! Everytime he get the ball he does that same “shot up with drugs”  dribbling, but never drives past him or do anything that makes it effective.
He really ain’t even fast tho 🧐
This man playing like he on 2k on point guard
78 dribbles for a missed jump shot 😂
bro got spongebob boots on
My boy play too much 2k😭🤣
Julian Newman looks a lil different these days
Gio would actually be way better if he grew some confidence and actually drive to the rim
Dollar store professor
oh no, Every time that tiktok fuck started dribblin, i started falling asleep knowing it was going to go for a while
Me in my chair eating my second bag of chips: “Damn they’re pretty bad..”
All of that just to fuckin miss
He got dribbles but no handles. He aint moving no where just dribbling like that. cant cross nobody.
He wouldn’t be good in games. Like team ones he is very self indulgent and under pressure panics and starts to fast dribble.
That jump shot thi
tiktok shirt, cringey
The comments will make this man quit playing like this is not gud 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
to cringe to watch for me
Look at his shooting form
Haha mi cousin and me hate that guy haha I can beat him I'll just do trees😂
The way he moves his legs results in a carry
It almost seems like he just moved his feet fast
This gio wise kid is cringy af
Mans doesnt even know how to shoot close range lol
bro move
Tough times don't last , tough people do ... I haven't seen a poster say that since the Disney movie " Summer Time Switch " 😏
Bro does 4 between the legs but just jumps left and right on his legs to make him seem "fast"💀
He good but ain't good against good players that are built well all around and not in one area.
When you put pure playmaking in 2k, but you only use the right stick
Good wise the type of guy to think that arm sleeves help ulyou play better
still lost to cam
Sounds like a dolphin cuh he just jittering his feet.
Never seen anyone other than Gio shoot the ball from under their chin....
my man's form----
Around 9:09 cash threw the craziest elbow😤you shit for that
this dude can dribble in place and can’t get anywhere but we ain’t gonna talk about his jump shot though 😂
this just a bunch of sneaker noise
He can dribble fast but hes not good
This could of been a blowout. If he kept driving he probably would’ve had a flawless win.
3:13
Have the professor show him how to really dribble and get open 😭😭
Lol Julian Newman 2.0
gio: 2k myplayer Cash: oldhead
If he could channel that handling ability into a few solid moves he could probably be a decent player. Standing in place dribbling literally just to dribble is the stupidest shit you can do on a bball court.
The drinking is soooouuu unesssasary
He aint no hooper
This reminds me of that episode of the Boondocks where Riley has monster handles, but can’t score or pass to save his life 😂😂😂
If u lost to cash u garbage
1:04 cash just Described gio whole game 😂😂
9:19 what was that pink spark thing
The tiktok dude was greenin a lot of deep 3’s in the beginning. Cash gave up too many open threes. But when he started defending it was over
Dude would not beat anyone in a 3 dribble 1v1
Buddy is wastin hella energy lmao 2 moves and explode to the basket would probably get him way more points
I’d be less annoyed at this kid if he actually learned to cross people over….
All he does is stutter his feet has no skill
Imagine spending thousands of hours hours practicing that ridiculous dribbling, hundreds of dollars on a hooper outfit, and ignoring literally every other skillset of basketball, only to find out one day that any coach would bench a player for holding the ball for more than four dribbles. Anyone encouraging this kid to keep making videos is what’s wrong with society.
Vibes of Julian Newman. Dribbling means nothing if you don't go anywhere.
This Niggah gio do the same dribble move every time and doesn’t go anywhere every time 🤣🤣
Dude is the trashiest player I've ever seen man...
There is literally no point in anything that guy does he may aswell stand still
What’s with all the dribbling, great cardio I guess. Came on you know top of the key is cash favor spot
All that dribbling for nothing
Its like on dbz when they start spamming ki blast and when the smoke clears the victim is just standing there untouched
The cash sound got me dead😂😂😂😂
cash nasty: “thats his weakness” dude everything is his weakness
bro this kid is shit in every way
Fast. Speed kills. In every sport even MMA. Speed baby
His shoe squeak nice but that’s all he got 🤣
Classic YouTube/tik tok basketball 😂😂😂😂
That blonde hair kid has to be trolling. No way. He ia literally doing the most baskc dribble moves in existence. But squeaking his shows as fast as he can to try to add affect. Dont let me down internet. Y'all aint let this kid get famous did you?
My guys shooting form is like flight
This kids easy to figure out. He dribbled fast and step back from the 3…. Force him into the paint and he is useless and has no defense
Gio vs. Julian Newman
GREAT TALENT!!!! TAP DANCING BALL DRIBBLING!!!!
All those steps he takes & still ain't got no 1st step 🤦🏽‍♂️
But who’s house is this??!
🗑
Cash was being nice til he disrespected him with the off the hizzle
Lol gio wise with no fundamentals
Manse got on lebrons wit a kobe jersey
samurai vs king tut
Show off...those handles are impractical, its better to focus on quickness and ball control when your going from 0 100, or 100 to 0.
Dawg do all that dribbling and miss half his shots in videos i seen of him
He plays like julian newman
He dribble to much
I need cash to come to New York or i pull up to him! He would not beat me 100%
I would like to play either of these dudes
Julian Newman be like:   Spam Dribbler
This lowkey the worst 1v1 i have seen in a minute lol.
Imagine if gio wise put his handles to use instead of dribbling in one spot
C'mon Cash -- be real. You let him hang around in the game. If you wanted to wipe the court with him, you'd have driven on him every time and ended it quick.   Gio is just a wannabe hooper of limited skill.
Demn
He dribbles more then James harden I thought i would never see the day.
This guy literally has o bag...Lmaoo
Ewwwww what was that 3:30
This was dumb. Worst content you've created. You played well. That kid is garbage. Wabble all you want. Doesn't do anything when you don't change your eye contact and body sway.
Is he being serious when he dribbles like that ?
That was lit fasho
Insto dribbled to a ad 🤣
What a shit game
No offense but dis boi look like James hardens brother
He’s not blowing by u my man I promise
Cash skipped leg day to pay them bills i guess
Cash after bricking 18 jumpers then finally making one “wet like water!!!”
It's like some spirit enter his body Lol 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Hes quick but he's in the same spot, he's not explosive, being explosive is different, he can hit the 3 but that's it man you need more...
Cash you coulda drove all day he got no defense at all
He do the same dribble all the time
Good job...u barely beat a 90 lb 13 year old....
Dude is like 5'8 and 90 pounds just a hard drive with your dominant hand or a back down gets you a bucket 99% of the time.
Dude make a lot of noise with his feet but ball is in slowmow
His shoes gotta be hot af after games
Kid shoukd stop doing all that
This dude Dribble dribble dribble and Doesnt Even Have The Right Form of shooting lmaoooo
Dude looks like a 2k player that doesn't get screens
that was fun, id love to go up against Gio!
This guy reminds me of those 2k sweats who only upgrade their threes and have every dribble move in the game
That Gio kid is a moron.........what a waste of energy. He will never go anywhere figuratively and literally with that style.
this guy is from 2k
You brick
Haha cash a legend told the man “ you got zero defense” hahahahaha
he actually ain’t dribbling fast he just moves his feet really quick that’s ridiculous
He barely beat a skinny dude who does one move (badly). Not much to brag about.
Cash Wise vs Gio Nasty 🤑🤑
The hole vid is gio dribbling for an hour just to miss
Cash: built like zion  Gio: built like a twig  Cash more long rangeshots
3:25 all for nothing 😭😭
Any one could do that “speed” he just does it because his dribbling looks ridiculous and ain’t no one stepping in front of him with that he just got a excellent shot
gio is just a better version of flight in playing basketball
Y’all haters that kid hit skills and a nice jump shot great game cash keep up the good work 💪🏽
Why this man just settling for jumpshots
He’s not even dribbling, he’s just squeaking his shoes as fast as possible
He need a pair of new kicks every day
i honestly hope this kid is joking when he dribbles like that I mean honestly it's an eyesore to watch him dribble and squeak the whole video
mans acting like he has hof ankle breaker in 2k. it dont work that way in real life
He’s terrible
i keep hearing gio wise everywhere and now im finally seeing it and wtf lol? this is just a taller julian newman with goku hair. i dont understand the excessive dribbling just to stay in one spot. looks cool for tik tok i guess.
I just wanna ask .... Why ?
Dude…WTF😂😅7OIQ
If gio actually know how to drive in he would of won since cash is tired out lol
wtf is that kids jumpshot
When that guy got a ball only sounds I can hear is a mf footsteps sound.
gio is a clown
Help build one tree cash lol
This kid cannot hoop whatsoever
Bouncing a ball and shuffling feet look good especially when you aint going anywhere. Hes shots are ok but he probably hit more if he shot mid instead of 3’s
Hate on him all you want but Gio would flame 90% of you
Gio is just doing basic dribble moves anyone can do just a bit faster...
that jumper lol
Bro his jumpshot is hard to watch
His shoes are like the squeaky boots from that okie spongebob episode
I feel like Gios game plan is lul you to sleep with his dribbling and then step back 3.
This guy should play professor
He just needs some guidance and a proper basketball coach to learn how to use his speed more efficiently, stop spamming those moves for no reason lol get a bit stronger and work on his drive and he can be decent.
This is weird
Bro wearing the squeaky shoes from spongebob
Steph Curry ruined basketball. 😂
Honestly we need to see Geo vs Flight.
Shooting logo 3s and spamming dribble moves？That’s the most Tiktok player I’ve ever seen
You guys mean Julian Newman? another fast dribbler but ain't going nowhere
Yow, Dobbs in the house
Gio is that one fighting games player who keep spamming ONE button for the entire round.
my eyes are hurt rn
He is not good man not too fast
Spam dribblers lack the foot work and body movement to actually get pass defenders
gio is me in 2k bruh, spamming moves cause i dont know any better lmao
I’d rather shit in my hands and clap than have to watch Gio dribble the ball for an hour straight
Those moves are useless
Julian newman need to 1v1 this fast dribbler guy
We gotta get a gio v flight matchup now
These kids think 2k is real life😂🤚 GGz thi
Bruh dude ain’t even fast tho 😭
i came back to rewatch this video just to make sure i was right when i thought “wow this kid really don’t be going anywhere”
His shot is good he just needs to stop spamming
Bro that title
2k kids irl be like
dribbling is pointless if your shot isnt wet
Wow his spam dribbling might be worse than Julian Newman
Homie be spamming right stick on 2k
All he needs to do is drive
I hate gio and he triggers me that’s all I have to say
I don’t think bro shot anything except 3’s the literal entire game
yo all those dribbles for what nobody likes a dribble spammers that don't go nowhere, "most hated tik toker" proves my point that nobody likes dribble spammers that don't go nowhere
Burning energy for nothing
Gio rn is too good
All cash needed to do is drive and it’s 12-0
Straight up Gio is shit at basketball
He's the type of player where you go up to guard him seriously once, see all the dumb shit and no progression,  then you just back up and play help D on a better person.
The opponent is an excellent ball handler, that fakes drives and spots up and shoots. But in a game I would give him a lane and see if he drives but contest every shot. If he learns to cross over with the dribble and drive to the rim to pass or shoot he will dominate a game
I want to help build a tree in a place in need!
Cash got that flight lung package out here
eek urk squeeeek squeek eek ureeek squeek
Dude must need new shoes after every game skating like that
He slow lol
I like his jump shot though that would actually be funny if he were consistent with it
He cant even get in
his jumpshots terrible
What’s the point of all that dribbling and not going anywhere at all he even dribbles when no one is guarding him
Gio's hater should just click off like, idk what's wrong, i aint no giowise fan, but the guy doesn't deserve the hate, he playin ball, the guy deserves some respect
Is that the wilson evolution?
Sounds like a dolphin at the start
8:30 Cash why didn't you just drive right?
The dude honestly has pretty good handles and quick feet. If he could learn to use those dribbles to go to the rack or free himself up for a jumper he would be a lot better off. Right now it just looks like he’s doing the spider drill and throwing up 3’s
He aint even dribbling fast tho? He just moving his feet fast the ball is bouncing the same speed as if u were dribbling normal.
4:29 the disrespect 😂
I didn’t know moving your feet a lot meant you dribble fats
Gio doesnt even play ball he fuckin ice skatin out here its not real ball if he just spamming dribble moves it just bitch play
Manz cardio is insane
that jumper got me dead XD
7:29 hop step is still a travel though....
Gio: Uber why are we not going any where, your just wasting my time  Uber: I can say the same thing when you dribble
I thought I was tripping at 9:21
He be playing 2k
1$ per dribble
If 2k was a person😂
Every time he dribbles his sneakers just destroy my ears
Gio didn’t move the whole game
Who is this dude Julian Newman’s lost brother ☹️😔⬇️😩🗑❌
Cashnastys shootings actually dogwater
Gio Wise is good and all, but he needs to work on his shots first, then he can dribble all he wants.   Never mind, watched full video. Still though, nice handles.
He really be doing all that just to step back and miss lol
"He playing like a grown man tho"
When you pour all of your points into agility
He fast but he ain’t finishing the clip lmao
I can dribble faster than that. Edit: but that doesn’t mean anything.
Man he a bad knock off version of the proffessor 😂
Bro my micccccccccccc with the shoe bro
🤣🤣🤣
everybody focused on the fact that he doesn’t go anywhere when he dribbles…. bro he ain’t even dribbling fast he’s moving his feet fast to create an allusion… he’s literally traveling
How you give this nigga 10 points cash 💀
SPAM DRIBBLER!!! hashahaahahahaha
How 2K Dribble Gods Be 😂 Doing All That Dribbling And Ain’t Going No Where 😂😂🤦🏽‍♂️ 💩
Bruh cash an all around player learns it by watchin bron 🤘🏻😂
If julian was taller 😂😂😂😂
stop spamming the right stick on 2k plz
I used to play like gio though. Long time ago, lots of combo moves in one spot, not really going anywhere. Lol, they tagged me THE HAPPY BOUNCER
Bruh cash looks 38...😂😂
fast dribblers can get tired easily HAHAHAHA
People prolly think he fast because of how many times his shoes squeaked
Quality over quantity
That boy suck man. Like aint no way boa
U CAN ALWAYS GET STRONG BUT TALENT AND SPEED U CANNOT OBTAIN U SALTY NUB U BUILD CHINA WALL WITH UR SHOT WTF.
This dude Gio got 99 in Handles and 3's, but a 0 in everything else. LMAO
8:38 only instance of gio actually moving
shouldve been in happy feet
That boy a tap dancer
He's not a fast dribbler  He's just a fast stepper
Bro you actually won
Why does he keep swishing threes with that jumper it doesn’t make sense
3:15 man created space and didn't shoot, remember it's not about looking cool it's about scoring
Gio is hella unathletic, if he was explosive on a drive he could be good. That aside homie acts like a dickhead
Cash your game will be much better driving in to your shot it’s tiring but near guaranteed
Bruh this vid would have been 5 mins long if he wasn’t spam dribbling
Cash got way better lol foot work shows
Waters not wet
Two scrubs going at it
he aint got a form
i hate this man man
hows malcom
Yeaaaaaa Cashhhh
This is why we don't hear bout tik tok ballers.
My boy Cash literally twice his body size and tells the dude how bad his defense is. You were just forcing him off every point
Lesson to the kids that think this is elite dribbling. If you are dribbling fast IN ONE PLACE and the defender is not moving... You failed.
Bro has no defense
Do some more cardio bro. You had to dig deep for that dub.
TIKTOK GET YO MANZ
Я смотрю ему футболки тик ток нравятся
WET LIKE WATAHHH
That man is buns
lmao cash was gassed
Turn to Jesus people he died for your sins, Repent of what the New Testament describes as sin. Believe the gospel obey the teachings of Jesus documented in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Jesus is the only way to be saved, be baptized if you have faith in Jesus then you will live life with him as your example. If you need prayer i'll pray for you. If you want to keep contact with a brother in Christ i’ll keep contact with you. The love of God is beyond our understanding. God bless..,,,
He kept hitting those deep threes thinking he's Steph or Lillard
When you put all your skill attributes on ball handles in 2k
Even when he’s on defense he spams 🤣🤣🤣
Reminds me of that episode from boondocks
The squeak sounds like flights laugh.
Yo in the beginning was that keenly dubbs that man a good damn dunker and went to my elementary school back in 2015
He dribbles until his defender gets irritated and gives up on defending him
Lol I think the title was changed for this video
Cash too swole
That shooting form lmao
Wtf is the point of dribbling like that he ain’t even cutting 2 the basket or nothing. He’s doing all that fast dribbling for nothing it just looks dumb.
Looks like he’s having a seizure when he’s dribbling. Dribbling super fast don’t get u anywhere in a real game.
Cash a blood 🅱️❤️💯👹🤣🤣🤣🤣
GO INSIDE ALREADY !! FFS!
watching him dribble hurts 😢
gio guards like flightreacts
I wonder if Julian Newman is his favorite player
Cash it’s been awhile man are you a hooper hooper yet?
His first possession had me dead 😂😂😂
One day if jitt get right no kizzy he gone be a problem 😌
All dribble, he should team up with Julian newman. They proly could build a mansion with all those bricks when playing up against better players lol
Its like mumble rap. All show, no go.
Julian Newman lol
I swear that man garbage
The fast flight
How you gonna have handles like that and that's your jumper? 😂 shit was falling I guess
When Cash is like 5 to 7 ft away he still dribbles
He dribble for no reason at all
All that for?
Bru I’m watching like friggin do something
Kid cant finish at the rim for his life
He obviously only practiced handles lmao. Can’t shoot for shit
Loloooooloool goin nowhere with all that dancing
He just me stomping his feet around
kid is literally dribbling to dribble he stands there and just dribbles and doesn’t move 😭🤦🏾‍♂️
This Gio dude creates no space he just waits until you get tired of watching him dribble and steps back. He is a pretty good shooter tho
Gio keeps stepping back and trying to shoot threes instead of pushing forward when he’s definitely capable of he just doesn’t idk why
Is he spam dribbler or spasm dribbler
Bro dude ain't on s... he treadmill dribbling he ain't going nowhere he is just fast thats it but he really ain't doin nothing
"What that right stick do"
When you only move your right stick in 2k
dumbass makes julian newman look D1
How tf he not tired? He flicking that analog stick like 2k
F*cking epileptic.
This is why we need 2k17/2k19 dribbling in the game
bro what is this i would honestly quit just because i would get tired just from standing there waiting for him to shoot he isn’t even going anywhere gio is a terrible basketball player
This is cramming, not applying I.q
All that dribbling just to not go anywhere, useless
He’s just wasting his energy 😔
when cash said F**K the easy lay i knew where he was going 🌊😂
I don't wanna talk to much shit about him because he looks like he's like 13 or 14 but he looks incredibly easy to guard. He's just dribbling in place not going anywhere.
Gio built like a newborn pelican
build a tree 🤣
Gio finna tear his soles off his shoes every second.
Cash can’t guard people like Gio. He plays too hard of defense on him
Cashnasty is doo doo all he did was layup the whole game
Bro I swear they said to 15 points lol
Professional players only use those moves because they have to in certain situations dribbling like that doesn’t do shit and he can’t finish at the rim
8:35 literally pounding the shit out of the ball like this is the only guy I’ve seen to actually dribble the air out of the ball
2k21 be like:
his jumpshot looks worse than flight's jumpshot
He need new shoes, the ones he got on is screaming for help😭😭😭😭
If you have good stamina you can't dribble someone tired by having them chase you if he played aggressive defense he might've won
Bahaha, this is like Fornite kids who build build build all crazy, but can't shoot. LOSER!
Doing too much
My man dribble like he having seizure
Man he’s like Riley from the boondocks got the dribble skills but can’t shoot for shit.
y’all really hating on him because he dribbles a lot really dumbest reason ever 😂
He is literally just a troll hooper. He can actually ball bruh
Gio overall:75 99 driblling  98 3pt  Defense 0  Layups 0 Driving 0 Dunking 0 Badges: No Where  Drip 30 Age idk
gio wise playmaking badges go more than 30
Flight dribble better than him wtf 💀
is this a repost? My memory says this is not uploaded in June or May
Hes a 99 overall playmaking build in real life
Gio Wise has zero defense he rly just put all his skill into dribbling and 3s 😑
Julian Newman 3000.0
What’s the point of all those dribbles if he can’t even get past his defender?
People like him thinks that handles = winning the game
Afteralluhthat.....  miss.....  he is faster than I was at that age...
Gio never played against a lock😂😂
If he actually went left and right more, like laterally and made his defender move to follow him, he could either cross them up or tire them out. But most of the dribbling results in his either staying in place or a step back. He could go to the rack if he just had the proper mindset
I bet I could beat gio wise I’m a 1v1
If he just looked up he could make the defender move and get by him. But he’s putting moved 4 feet away from the defender
no point in hesi mid if you don’t shoot any mid
Tic tok kid all offense and no defense
Cashnasty your next 1vs1vs flight u going to beat him in  sandals lol 🤣
Gio needs to look up
Same dribble moves every time
He remind me of those Playmaking Shot creators that sell in the park 😂😂
He doesn’t really do anything he just dribbles fast then shoots his dribbling doesn’t really help him at all
He dribbles with his head down and goes nowhere... what's the point u do all that to put up a brick
the only thing that's fast is his feet changing location not his dribbles lol
All that dribbling just to stay in the same spot and shoot a contested 3
Dribbling for dribbling sake does not a basketball player make
Ngl game was close and cash looked more tired despite gio over dribbling
"Hes playing like a grown man out here" 🤣🤣🤣
3:12 when u get that playmaking badge
All he does is do cross overs and just his feet he doesn’t do other moves
Gio really be doing all of these dribbles for legit bo reason like he the 20 dribbles and he goes from top of the key to the wing, honestly he shit af
Both y’all need more moves
I mean he would probably  would breaking ankles but he’s literally just staying In one place
Gio style only work against beginners and cash style only work against shorter opponents lol
Gio was never told to "dribble to score not to explore"
He’s every playshot on 2k
Gio Wise vs Julian Newman who you got $$$
What is this dudes jumpshot.this dude has created the new spam for 2k 22 lol
Put 0.25 speed and max volume them click on this 8:17
he is not a hooper, he's just a dribbler 😐
He dribbles how I picture a crackhead would dribble and his shot is boo boo 😅
This nigga can dribble but I didn't see him do something  efficient 😂😂😂
you ever see a glitch dribbler before? here you go.
cash didn’t need to shoot a single jumpshot this game
Nobody:  Kenny every time after Gio makes a shot:  "ooooooooooooooo"
3:37 “I’m getting too thick for these videos” 😂
Idk y he playin up on kash it’s forcing him to drive let em shoot🤦🏽‍♂️
Why does gio pick the squickiest shows ever
This guy ain’t effecting anything, he just showin off
When's he gonna make a step forward lol
His form his garbage, it can't even be recycled
I swear if he squiks his shoes one more time👿
*5 dribbles only!*  This guy: 😫😭
Gio Wise deadass reminds me of Riley Freeman in that episode where Riley played basketball and could dribble nice as fuck but couldn’t even score a layup 😂
his defense like his dribbling, jitter af
Man acts like he’s getting paid $2 every dribble
Title should be called “1v1 Basketball vs Legend 60 overall Spam Dribbler”
julian newman 2.0
Cash with layups all game against a teenager
Y’all talkin shi like gio don’t got 10pts all 3s
He shoots from his waist like a 2nd grader. And the only way they could shoot is if you let em right?
literally 50 plus dribbles just to brick and run for the ball lol
Geo dribbles the ball 17,000 times in this game to eleven. I counted.
Geo is just an embarrassment 😂 hate playing with guys like that in real life... 2k as well lol
Imagine Gio with a shot clock 😂
Cash traveled on the 8th point tho
This kid learned to dribble from Julian Newman hahaha 🤣🤣🤣
Its cool that he knows how to do 34 travels per posession.
Cash you shooting bricks man
It really pisses me off how he does all that and then misses
Mrbeast 2.0
He just ain't that good
He’s not even that fast he’s just moving his feet fast
Did you pay him 30k for a 1v1 those are his requirements
what does he say before he shoots? 8:33
This is what happens if you have handles like curry but shoots like jeef green...
HOF clamps 😂😂
This Man got Some Real Squeaky Shoes
Bruh is the guy had any change of speed he would kill everyone
Both 🗑 😂😂😂
Banger🔥
All he doing is moving hes feet fast thats all he aint moving nowhere its like skating on ice without skates lmao
When he threw the ball at his head 🤣🤣🤣
What happen to leg day cuhhh.
Oh shittt. Kenny Dobs in the Buildinnnn.
when you got new shoes 0:01
Follow my Twitter account everyone @DaeGotGame
Is all that dribbling necessary?
Gio is just a rip-off flight with his crab dribbles
should we tell him that dribbling in the same spot and going backwards not going for the layup is not gonna help him make 3’s
Cash I got 500 I smoke u game 16
What do you expect from a kid who wear tiktok shirt 😂😂
my pc is on fire bro i didnt see nothing else of laging the video hahahaha lmao
He’s only fast when he stays on one spot that’s about it
6:38 cash nice hesitation but u got to finish the lay up
I know one thing. he ain’t never traveled a day in his life.
Not even a mid range jumper was seen 💀
One can't shoot and one can't drive 😂
9:06 travel
Instead of learning how to be lethal, this dumb dude decided to learn how to dribble extremely fast. That's where you draw the line between people like Lamelo, trying dumb shot when he was younger, but actually was at least trying to be unguardable, and people like this guy, learning how to dribble in the most useless way possible
cash literally shoots worse than flight
noob wise
Jajajaja sucks!
Does cash know there’s something called a mid range shot?
Seeing gio dribble and open and not shoot makes me mad!!
If he diddnt dribble like he’d die if he stopped and actually forced his way the the net with his handles he could be good but this shit is just him tryna be cool smh
He don’t even have creative moves bro he just dribbles in the same spot 💀
This what you call going "Nowhere".....FAST
Lmfao “damn that mf wet” had me crying
9:03 ig no one's talking about this travel?
Cash does what I do, whenever I start losing a 1v1, I go into the paint and score post shots.
That was interesting
T-jazz would've ate both of them
Gio thinks he can beat cam but can’t even beat cash😭😭😭😭😭
up to this day the spamer is most hated on tiktok
This is hilarious Gios offensive strat is to dribble until defender is lulled to sleep or just gives up. It’s like a weird endurance dribbling
the thing is bro dribbles not that bad he just be doing to damn much
How much you pay him to be there?
gio plays the exact opposite of me. i dont like dribbling and i always shoot mids
He's not even really good at dribbling. ANY coordinated hooper can do that but they don't because it just tires yourself out. These videos show me that practically any one who really hoops an average amount/level can have a decent chance to beat Cash.
He can’t even play ball to be honest he’s just for show.
everytime he got the ball i said “oh my god” out loud
You guys know how there is a YouTube vs tiktok boxing match there should be YouTube vs tiktok basketball match
U know if gio made more shots and moved he would be hated a lot less
The dude is just stoppin his feet real fast ain’t no pace…plus that follow through in his shot 💀
Max handling and half 3 shot default def Basketball IQ unkown
Cash get ya cardio right back bro and to be honest I’m pretty sure the way u be on ya pivot from heel to toe would be called a travel most times lol good content doe .
You’re almost a hopper hooped
bro has no defense at all
He can’t even dribble just doing the same stuff
Is that the professor from wish😂
I love how he just waited for Gio to miss his shot before he went to his sponsor lmao
He gives me Julian Newman vibes
All I here is squeak squeal when Gio dribbles
10:30 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cash this is the first and last time im giving into one of your sponsorships. I just spent $50 on a poster, but much love to you.I have watched your vids for 2 and a half years now. I hope you see this.
In a real games with 24 second clock violation this guy will average 0.5 points, pointless dribbling
if i were playing like gio then i think i will faint cuz of his unecessary dribbling mein
Gio just tiring himself with all the unnecessary movements
can't lie the lil nigga got a strap on him
That guy stares at the rim for 2 seconds and thats how you know when he gonna shoot
He ain’t spamming it’s his shoes making noise man has no skill
If cash can beat him, anyone can
Dude took all 3s
Bruh cash 1v1 me anytime I'd drop u
I'm yelling at my screen just telling him to shoot lmao
Not impressed with dem b.s.  handles  lame
Bro Gio dribble like a 88 in the park and be like you can’t guard me then get strapped up
he just moving his feet he not really dribbling fast why everyone fooled… shit is ridiculous.
Top moments in vid: Cash Blocks Gio, Cash steals it from Gio (Knocks it out of bounds)
Cam waiting gio
Cam waiting gio
Cam waiting gio
Cam waiting gio
Cam waiting gio
Cam waiting gio
Where is gio cam waiting
Did he get his 30k
Anyone who plays defense will expose this guy … 🍪
He nice
Y even brick ur shots when u can beat him in the post every time
The frantic sycamore daily recognise because fine undeniably miss per a sturdy vessel. paltry, embarrassed helicopter
W
Why he shoot like that😂 he just chunks it cuz he has not arm strength
Yo cash this man Gio is not going nowhere
He don’t even dribble quick he just shuffles his feet rapidly like wtf 😂, he’s like one of those electronic football game pieces that get moved by vibration 😂
I think gio’s style of basketball is like a stuck up 5th grader: he decides what he will do before the play begins and doesn’t play with reactions and do certain moves according to what the defense does. This is why he constantly makes moves that do absolutely nothing except give the defense an eye sore.
I can’t imagine if he could shoot
All you literally have to do is play off a little & he’s basically locked 😂🤷🏾‍♂️ because he doesn’t really move forward when he dribbles
Play cam wilder
You should train him on shot and the paint
if gio had a bit more of an orthodox shooting form and had more moving dribble moves he would be much better. also needs more defence
Just gaurd the three 😆 he ain't driving in.
why does he wear a tiktok shirt… that’s like cash wearing a youtube shirt to show he makes youtube videos
How is this dude gio relevant? He just dribbles but doesn't go no where...what is he even doing.  And that jumper....🤮
When we seeing Juuuuuuuuuuuuune flight vs cash "the hulk" nasty💯💯💯💯
He go through 3 pairs of shoes every week wit how much he grinding them against the ground
This dude did all this dribbling just to brick🤦🏾‍♂️
Hahaha kids these days. All dribbles but can't shoot for shit.....wow!!!!
Y’all keep hating and he stays making money
Cash went out sad backing gio down like that this nigga only can shoot from the top of the key gio sorry asf for losing to him😑
All the kid does is dribble until you get tired of watching the same 4 dribble moves over and over again then steps back and shoots from his chest but he's a basketball influencer on tiktok🤔 yall are lost with no map
He’s such a bum
This nigga gio have such bad iq that he is guarding cash from the 3 point line
Who she ears were getting damaged from dribble sound gio was doing
3:13 Cash you don’t have to move to guard him how did he do this to you
3:05 wtf was that cash
Lot of unnecessary dribling hurts my eyes and ears for that squeaky sound
Yo Cash 1v1 AJ lapray
Cash realized last 5 minutes that he can just go to the paint and destroy this man.
Dude 3x his size wanna settle for a jumpshot...
Dribbles in place and goes nowhere! Then shoots from his chest. Jeez!
This nca wearing compression pants outdoors 😡
Bro that is unnecessary as hell.
nowhere cash, he wasnt going nowhere
This guy gio does not drive
pov geo wise just hit as2 and unlocked patch dribbles
Bruh Gio could seriously be really good if he just used his dribbling to actually get around the defender instead of looking like a fish out of water
Cash skip leg day
bro how he do all that AND STILL LOOK AT THE FLOOR THE WHOLE TIME.
Why you always walk away when you shoot cash it looks cool when you make it ig but still it look mad awkward 😭
Gio sucks cuz he's dribllings have no meaning
This man dribbles for like two minutes straight, bounces the ball off of cash's head then gets denied at the rim.... he spam dribbles but as no finishes
Am I the only one who saw them sparks at 9:20
Bro goes through 4 pairs of shoes in a week
imagine this tiktoker dribbling like that thinking everyone is a orange cone lol
That guy isn’t good he just goes through the legs behind the back 10000x for no reason then shoots and misses and doesn’t even try to get a lay up
U try to play bully ball when u know u bested that would not work with me😂
Gio acting like theres scouts
At this point flight better den him
Dribbled for min and some change just to miss the shot🤣
Did u pay him 30000
What was the little sparks at 9:20
I hate tik tok
bro this dude went to my school 💀
he sgould 1v1 flight
Wasnt they going to 15 or am i trippin
Anybody notice gios only points were deep 3s lol
professor better then gio lmfao
ngl this dude dribble like Julian Newman
Another Julian Newman here we go again
Yoooo when gio hit cash with the ball and cash block him OMGGG 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nah he really dribbling for no reason & is going no where
Gio kid is just traveling with all them leg and stutter steps before the ball even hits the ground
It's just the feet thats fast. But the dribbling? nah. He's going nowhere.. no hate.. just tellin' the truth.
Isn’t the purpose of a dribble move to create space? This kid is just trying to look cool lol
Only cash could is use his  body strength  for layup in the paint. Lol
dont disrespect the disrespector
This man said “build a tree.”
Gio is the type guy you call him to play and he doesn’t even show up
Did u pay 30,000 or no because you clouted for him
Clutch nasty ?
That kid must have never made a team lol
herl yeah im not the only one who thinks all that dribbling and the way he moves is pointless
8:12 🤣🤣
Ayyy
This dude just a more spammie worse prosfesor live
never seen cash wore a kobe jersey before
But can’t play cam🤦🏾‍♂️
Cash had to pay 30k?
Cash got intimidator hall of fame
Ain’t this vid pretty okd
He just came down to okc him & ball is life & it was lit I was giving him buckets, video be uploaded soon
You was supposed to big body him in the post all day.
bro if only he played normally he would be decent his shooting nice tho
Somebody get Kuzma’s lil bro 🤣
I guess because you never know when he is going to stop and shoot but still waste of energy
He shoots like he’s in seventh grade
This is like watching a hound dog and a hyperactive chihuahua fighting against each other.
All that the first shot jus to miss lmaoo
Gio can actually get better if he dribbles like that to lose off the defender and just make a rush to the rim
it's the same combo😭
Gio in an actual game would be terrible he looks down and dribbles, his shot form is terrible, he doesn’t go anywhere with his dribble, he just practices combos and squeaks his shoes to look cool. His combos don’t even work, he looks stupid doing them, it looks like he is having a seizure while dribbling
This dude is all show he can’t do anything, he doesn’t even know how to use his dribble moves, he just memorizes combos and tries to look cool
Is that Julian newman?? 😂😂😂
Didn’t even put him in the description 😂😂😂
This guy is very bad, he tries to demostrate and it’s lamentable, he thinks it’s professor and is embarrassing
"Gio misses"  make sure you get a special discount 🤓
A whole 2k iso he doesn’t move😭
This kid probably sat on the bench while playing JV. Any real basketball player will shut him down. He wouldn't be able to guard anyone. He's like 120lbs. Probably won't be able to shoot under pressure. Just. No.
i paused it at 6:55 if cash loses i’m never watching one of his basketball videos again
Nah that “He didn’t go no where” took me out 😭😭😭
He moves more his feet than the ball
GOD bless💕🙏🏾✌🏾
Dude too much dribbling
What gio does in 50 dribbles I could do in 5
Ik this is obviously, but Cash plays alot like Bron
Y is this guy hated, he’s respectful and he’s good
All gio does is dribble a bunch then go deep
What is going through his head when he dribbling like that 😂😂
He’s just wasting energy lmao
Its not fast dribbling he is just moving legs fast...look closely at the ball
He plays smoothly till he starts button smashing
Cash money 4 tha win
2:30 I'd really like a how to video on building a tree
when he dribbles he don’t go anywhere 😂
Impeccable?!😂 every move was a spam into a deep step back
If you actually guarded his shots you would've blocked him each time because his release is low asf
While he is a decent shooter, he has ZERO defense and he does all that dumbass dribbling for no reason. That shit will legitimately get him nowhere in life. He must be a Julian Newman fan.
He not even dribbling
dawg his dribbling is really irritating the FUCK outta me
How he play cash but duck cam
He had like 7 potential ankle breakers if he would stop that exaggerated bullshit he does. It pisses me off because he actually has talent but does a lot of stupid shit
If Gio's game was more mature he'd be real nice
Man that's julian newman
bro can dribble just dont know how to use it
first time I saw Gio move
i rlly can’t take gio seriously when he plays, dude’s a joke💀
“This is aint water this that grey goose” -Gman
I missed like 4 seasons cash can hoop now 😂😂😂
Was it me or that cameraman was sucking tf outta that tik toker
Bro I’m tired of seeing this guy 😂😂😂 he ain’t that good bro let’s be realistic
Dude dribbles like he has a seizure
I can beat cashnasty 1on 1 i will be 37 on Tuesday 😎💪
Cash you need to bring your paint skills more often instead of shooting
You traveled big time at 9:10
Man did all those hamdles but only shot 3s
Wet like water.. this bum shot 2-8 from three 😂😂
Wit all the clout cash got, he can definitely play Lebron now
The boy is a 2k Character he dribbling In one spot 😂😭not goin no where
Hahahahaha is this a joke
He dribbles for no reason
The yummy crocus provisionally shock because withdrawal operationally suspect notwithstanding a material olive. crowded, neat security
W tittle
Y’all hatin on tha boy he fast can shoot and great handles
Bro I haven’t finished the video but Cash isn’t even trying rn Gio is dog shit
Didn’t they say first to 15
Insane
Bro obviously fast if he actually went somewhere with the ball he’d be an actual good dribbler
4:21 is clearly a double dribble this shit is horrendous
He should play vs Professor live
The fact people like White AI & dude with the braids he hyping that up is crazy he don’t know nothing bout 4dribbles 1v1 cause he would get bodied
If gio didn’t dribble that much he would be way better let’s all be honest
Do a 3 dribble limit with em lol
bih played entirely too much 2k17
If he gets his shot down and starts moving laterally with his dribbling, sheeeeeeeeesh.
Wouldn't say he's hated😭there is nothing to hate on gio is absolute dog water😭 he spam dribbles for no reason he goes nowhere and just chucks up shots and bricks
all he does is step back 3’s
Cash he at 8 now🥲😂
This was hard to watch, both sides
Cash "wet like water" couldn't find the ocean
Gio is that one playshot that keeps dribbling even if the defender is not on him and his teammates are open then he says the defender is lost😂😂
Lmmfao tell gio its a DUB...not a dove🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Shot clock violation by the time yes done dribbling 😂😂🤣
Just drive on him every time, lil man can't handle the body
Cash you should 1v1 Hansel Emmanuel
Bruh his shot is how I shot in 5th grade. Bud don’t have enough strength to not shot from the hips.
I smell and feel Julian Newman vibes from this dude
Man literally chucks the ball the up praying it goes in every time 🤣
In my opinion He still a good ball handler to spam  dribble moves like that
Gio be like. I’ll give you $500 to let me beat you
He looks like a downy dribbling
Lol he would get his cookies taken in a 5v5 as he’s doing all that dribbling he’s legit looking down the whole time
just yelling at my screen like 'YO SOMEONE PLEASE TAKE THE MID-RANGE SHOT ITS RITE THERE'!!!!!
Mans can’t shoot to save his life
6:13 slow it down and he takes 4 steps whiteout the ball touching the ground
Cash u being nice like he could have just bodied him in the paint all game but he decided to shoot most of the game
He just a playmaker tbh not hating 😅
His jumpshot looks like  how I use to shoot halfcourts in lunch games of knockout
This nigga spam dribble with his head down to stay in the same spot. Hilarious🤡
hes actually a nice guy
“He didnt go nowhere” LMFAOOO
See cash can shoot but it has to be from farther away
That last shot was clean as hell
Lmao dat boi just Julian Newman wit some height he not nice
How he play cash but ain’t play the other dude😐
Gio needs to mix up his game. Notice how all he did was score from deep 3
Here the thing did cash pay 5,000 to show up and 30,000 to play him
He ducking cam wilder tho.
We would have next low light series if he played in ncaa :)
Nobidy see that spark next to cash at 9:21?
What is that jumpshot?!🤢🤮
Cash looking like flight with the replays
bro he doesn’t attack mans jus sits there’s no point in making a move if it takes you no where attacking the basket i could teach my dog to dribble in place it takes talent to put the move to use in situations and get to the rim or draw defenders in and kick it to a teammate for an open shot
Just push up on him and he is gonna lose the ball ez, only thing he is good at is shooting.
Lmao when he reaches on gio u can see how he actually don’t even got handle like that 😂 he almost loses it every time off any reach
Havent even watched the whole video before I becam e a subscriber. The mind mentality is what i loved. 👍
His form is horrific
the shots he took didnt even require him to make any sort of dribble move...
Bro anyone could dribble like that, but they don’t because it doesn’t get them anywhere 😂
why do cash shoot jumpers sm on these lil ahh niggas 😭😭😭
Buddy said If it’s not a step back 3 I don’t want it
Real 2k player 😂
Bro wtf he doing
To whoever thinks he is a good dribbler 😂 he stays in the exact same spot spams, does a little step back and shoots. Anyone with half a brain could guard him 😂 basketball isn’t what it use to be haha, now it’s just all who can do a dribble move and who can shoot the most threes lol
“ Flights makes dolphin noise”  9:32
He’s j shaking his head and dribbling in the same spot
gio wise a bum
Him and Julian Newman would be besties
All dat dribbling pissing me off cuh
All that dribbling just too miss
6:13 he learned that from flight
gio wise is legitimately the worst basketball player i have ever seen
Why you look like kyrie in the thumbnail
I didn’t really like basket ball, let alone watching it. But this guy is funny, inspiring, all around a great guy.
Dribbling for a fucking long time then miss the fucking shot fucking imagine that?
Cash a blood😂🩸
I wanna play both of these guys loll
Comp be like:
He posted on TikTok that you can’t guard him but he lost 🤣🤣
U see the spark in the back bro
I wanna see gio vs ballislife west coast squad will see

Cash's jumper reminds me of broken glass
This game did not have to be this close lol
This ain’t 2k lol bro
This man said gio got no defence even tho cash is a grown man and gio still a kid 💀
He’s too little boy needs to lift
All he does is shuffle his feet at 100 mph and dribble LMFAO how are those called handles 😭
This guy moves his feet three times per dribble how is he not traveling
Spam dribbler Ong he only do the same moves I wanted to see sum
Gio got no game
I know cash won fair and square but all he did was rim run until last point
That screech screech screech sht is aggervating
Kid literally plays w his head down
Real life steezo

I thought the game was to 15 lol
You lying you know he can’t hoop

Gio’s jumper be looking like me in first grade tho
I also think cash carried a couple times
He was hitting the 3s tho
pov ur waiting for him to upload nick vid

True definition of a 1 trick pony 😭
Nobody:  Me:
He cant shoot his head is down when he shoots the ball
He has no defense
The kid has no driving skills
He cant go in the paint😂
He really just dribbling for no reason tbh
This is literally a POSTSCORING LOCKDOWN VS. PLAYMAKING SHOTCREATOR😂😂😂
Lmaoo he crazy cash

cash 1/20 talking bout “wet like water”
This man has is the definition of  a 94 play shot  who dribbles all the time
He can’t shoot
Why is he hated again he seem nasty
Setup a 1v1 julian newman vs gio
This dude is on ice. He fast, but ain’t goin nowhere.
not paying some bills cash?
He gotta be a character
Type of guy to average a double double every game, 10+ points 10+ Turnovers
Bro Gio is like that 2k player that spams dribble moves and then has the laggy green shots.
Why you dribbling tho ? You not blowing by ion get it
Cas needs to stop skipping Leg day
Like the score is 10 and 10.... seems like they're both tired. And Gio still had the audacity to dribble like crazy. Does that man got limits😆
Only way kids breaking his defenders is breaking they’re ear drums
Didn't know you build tree's 🌴 thought they grew  🤦🏾‍♂️
Shot clock is Gio’s worst nightmare
The question is can he even do that with his head up
Lol this man got that 38 jumpshot  on 2k🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
He played cash but not cam 🤦🏾‍♂️
What in the offbrand professor
6:44 only if he did this every time
That just julian newman on steroids

Hey Cash! They can’t disrespect you mannn!! You hit that wet like water 💧 from top of the key, with no D? Come on man they got to put some respect on yo name! I love Cash!❤️ This man is crazzzzyyyy
No one wanted that kid to win lmao
Nobody: Kenny: whooooooohooooooo wo ooooooo
Mans got smoked by cash thank god 😂
Rigged
R2BBALL FRIED HIM go watch a actually baller vs him and watch him get cooked I know ya all wanna see that 😂😂😂
That shooting form uglier than Travis Scott
Brooo he dribbles like my 2K character😭✌🏽
CASH IS THE MOST CLUTCH HOOPER ON YOUTUBE
Each like is how much GATORADE BOOST Gio buys before every game
Doing all them dribbles
Biggest bum behind julian newman
He sucks. He dribbles and goes nowhere
The dribbling is like his charge up
I’d rather be fast
5:27 “Hopefully I can take this dove” 🕊
Wtf is this man's jump shot 😭
Cash getting busted by a e boy soon as he got off his steroid cycle hes half the size he was 🤦‍♂️
Bro said we helping build a tree😭😭😭

gio really doing all that dribbling for no reason smh
Cash Play Me 1-on-1 in Houston “King of the Court” Every Bucket Scored is added to the grand Prize first one to 10 win is crowned King. Loser gets a punishment from the viewers. Only 5 dribbles. No wagers. I win for free..
Bro that guy gio is shit he literally just move his legs and do the easy dribbles he is shit
bro gio hot the ball off cash’s head then got packed
Displate posters are astonishing, quotes mega fire. let's Gooooooo cash  💵😤💰😤😤💰😤💵
This dude finna waste the whole shot clock dribbling 😂😂😂😂
the same moves every time from this dude
Wtf is that shirt
He just like the noise his shoes make
U can clip na
Cash could literally drive everytime
He play how I did in 8th grade lmfao
And banks
Bro there is no point he just  Dribble for no reason
Okay Cash! Top of the key!!
Bruh just cause you can dribble fast don’t mean you good🤣
Never heard of this guy, but after watching this vid, I see Gio everywhere......is he trying to piss ppl off? Serious question with his dribbling because he gets nowhere with a push shot.
wait cant you just put your hand in there...like his head isnt even up
Julian Newman and Gio would be an hilarious match 😂
Tiktokker Julian newman
when he shoots he looked like his arm boutta jump off his body
bro moves his feet fast and calls it dribbling
He be dribbling like a comp guard on 2k 🤣
Showing of
Had to watch this on mute
He’s just moving his feet his not really dribbling
He like Julia newman
POINTLESSSSSSSSSSSSS
Gio thinking he's the professor
Bruh jus stay stationary dribbling an then pulls from the hash to pray he makes it 🤡
Cam is better
No finish no cross
Ok
All that dribble to shoot a three anyways
His dude just dribbles but gets no where,
My revenge is near...
He's just doing 20 extra dribbles doin nothing LMAO 😂
He shoots like a ninja turtle
2:29 "You Build one tree." - Cash 2021
"Billion dollar move... one cent finish"
He got the moves he just don't know when to use them
Playmaking shot creators be like
Will you rather be fast or strong?🤔
Is this Julian newman’s handicapped brother?
He looks like an IRL play shot
Bro think he playing real life 2k🤦🏼‍♂️
All thos steps aint a travel ?
Happy feet style
He basically dribbles like a playshot from 2k😂😂
All cash had to do is go to the basket Everytime and gio would have scored once cause cash is stronger than gio
This game is the perfect example that all PG’s be selling the game on nba 2k because all they want to do is dribble the clock
Cash better then me, I woulda took it in after that blocked shot 😭💯
Cash looking like Melo with that jab step
He  did all that dribbling just to airball. Had to turn the video off right there 💀
whars more cringe the tiktok shirt or the dribbling
What is the use of all the dribbling when he does not even penetrate. All the does is go back. As all his points were jumpers and he did not even drive to the paint once.
just dribbling ag the same spot not moving lockup and he gone lose
Cash can't shoot he garbage
The transition on 1:16 was disrespectful 💀😭
Its like naruto spending his chakra for no reason 🤣
I know his shoes have zero grip after every game 😅
Bro fast af he just gotta get shifty. His shamgod didnt do anything to cash
do boxing content with 2hype!
This is what our 2k players would be irl
🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️🕊🕊🕊💪💪💪
bro how could he not figure cash out dude is the same every play. like not even hating cash it just shows how bad gio is
He said build a tree I’m schleeeeep
Gio clapped tho 😬
It looks like 2k
Any decent hooper cooking this child
That idiot does all the dumb ish to shoot a three?
Another Julian Newman
He’s just moving his shoes
He just stands in one spot dribbles in one spot and step backs in one spot 😭😂
The dude did alot of unnecessary dribbling. My coach taught us if you dribble atleast go towards the goal
He thinks shuffling his feet at max speed in the same spot equals dribbling fast.
Cash sucks claims he a Shooter but backs down a lil tik tok kid sad case
Be handles and jumper I've seen in a while
This nigga watched Flights crab dribble and ran wit it
But actually gio is good, just need to stop dribbling to much
This the one guy who doesn’t pass in 2k
mans still behind the 3 point line lmaoo
ok atp yall hate on him for nun
He goes nowhere when he dribbles
I’ve never seen someone with that great of handles put it to such a waste and not be able to drop a single body
did u pay 30k to play him
By 2
Thats like someone juggling bowling pins and thinking they can bowl
I have not played basketball in a year but I lowke wanna 1v1 flight
all that dribbling and he cant even drive off of it lol
if cash would just stop tryna shoot, this game would've been half as long
is it me or does he remind you of Julian Newman
nba and college players don’t dribble like maniacs😭🤦🏼‍♂️ and this kid says i wanna go somewhere
This man playing like a 2k park player
Never seen less defense from cash than in this game lmao.
The way that gio plays just kinda pisses off people who actually play basketball
He literally travels every time he comes out his triple threat.. moving too fast picking up that pivot foot before he starts dribbling
Spam dribbler vs flight ? 😂
BRUH HE LITERALLY A 2K AVATAR
Lyrics:  yo wsg good everybody
He isn’t even dribbling that fast he is just shuffling his feet
All the dribbling and going absolutely nowhere
He tires himself out with all that dribbling.
I have the West Shaq all star jersey from that year and the blue Iverson one. 💪🏽
3 dribble limit?
He’s playing cash put him up against LSK dude with half of hair is garbage
but where’s the speed boost?
he reminds me of flight
He's dribbling slow he's just moving his feet
We got can’t drive vs can’t shoot 😂
Tekashi suck
All that shitty dribbling for nothing
Lol the only time he moves he looks like he’s standing still
Bro all that dribbling just to brick 🤣
man think he got range 😭
He's just dribbling and can't finish it 🤣
Imagine what will happen when he finds out dribbling doesn’t score points
He’s gotta buy a new pair of shoes every game because he wears out the traction 😂
Julian Newman 2.0
I want him to play the professor
Gio has skills, but no iq to put it to use
This is going to be good
man if a guy wears tiktok shirt you already win
Cash had a close game with this gio kid I lost all respect for him 🤦🏽‍♂️
It's a lot of shoe squeaking but it's nothing special, the ball is just dribbled regular... movement without action.
The dribbles don't do much for him when he plays against somebody with good defense but he was flamethrowering them threes though he shot 4 in a row.
6:08 again did all that just to miss a 3 😂
Did anyone see the spark at 9:20
Julian Newman effect
3:08 he did all that just to miss a 3 😂😂😂
Zero defense but  body more than shoot lol
His defense bad too. Look he’s defending from the outside instead holding you down the rum
He’s a fast ball handler like Julian Newman not shifty
julian newman cousin
Julian Newman 2.0??
just ear raped me at the begining i got head phones on bro LMFAOO
7:29 is that a travel
He one of them dude that dribble and try to iso but everytime they get the ball stolen
James harden vs Jeremy Lin ?
he dribbling just to dribble lmao
Wea he goin chief🤨
Wait when tf cash get 2 points
This why i hate playshots in 2k😂
Cash really said magment
Bro I feel bad for his shoes
No hate to him but gio definitely needs to develop more than just the three ball,he’s one dimensional and is very predictable
I don’t see why everyone hates Gio,he’s pretty cold,he just needs to focus on going somewhere when he dribbles and his defense.   I’m probably gonna get a lot of backlash for this comment.
he dont make no sense 🤣
He does to much 😂😂
Anything today to get famous I rather hit my hand with a hammer and scream MOM I NEED A BANANA 🍌!!!
Flight vs gio would be the funniest shit ever 😂
All he does is dribble to lull u to sleep, then he does a step back
He be throwing up prayers
Lol he didn’t go nowhere
Gio gonna end up getting dropped if  he keep Squeaking  on that type of court
Someone should've explained to this kid it's called basketball for a reason, not dribble ball
I really don't wanna be a hater but damn, I don't think he knows what pace is, and those dribbles are all pointless. I've seen him time & again on my explore page and he's never improved. the day he ever learns an once of footwork, or even just how to dribble and move at the same time Lmaooo then we can talk. He's exactly what i'd think a Tiktok basketball player would be xD watch film of great guards, watch how they score, and add bits & pieces to your game.
slashers with no screens to help
Julian Newman brother?
I’m 5’6” and you could both get it
Imagine doing all that dribbling to lose by 2
95% of these social media hoopers are just terrible & yes including cash 😂🥱
It dribbles fast side to side in one spot but when he goes to drive, man looks like he’s in slow motion
He spamming Ai
on momma im beating this kid 12:4 bro his weakness is layups all he does is dribbles steps back
We gotta respect that he does have handles🏀🏀
y’all should play with a dribble limit next time
I hope you didn't pay this clown 5k "just to show up" on top of a "10k bet" LOL
Bro he does the same dribble moves over and over like bruh 🤦🏻‍♂️
he’s terrible he’s playing cash which doesn’t hoop. and lost to him which is sad. if he plays these tiktokers he keep challenging he’s going to win 0 games. I know whatever high school team he plays for has a losing record.
Jesus loves you 🎞
On god this nigga don’t even dribble fast he just brand new shoes and shifts his feet quick to make the squeaky sounds but this nigga dribbling average speed
All he does is stutter step. Almost as if he likes listening to how his shoes sound on the court. The same as that Nike spoof commercial from scary movie.
Only time he moves while dribbling is when he does the behind the back 🤣🤣🤣🤣
7:50 travellll
Cashnasty is not a great baller at all.  Stick to muscles and reaction videos, pal.  In one year this Tic Tocker will destroy you.
video start 3:00
If he learned to swap speed he can be a demon but he jus dribbles in place😭😂
“would you rather be fast or strong”😂cash that was dumbest fuckin question if you vote strength you’re a bot😂brute force don’t win everything
Why do people hate this guy he see.s kinda chill.
All he does is dribbles, jumps, and throws. He’s super easy and predictable
Gio needs to learn forward motion and Cash was cheat defending staying a foot from the key or straight in the key.
His hair moves more then him dribbling
Aye my boi Julian Newman finally grew taller.  --CONGRATS MAN--
His joystick are gonna break
This reminds me of all the playmaking shot creators on 2k
Can I just say that Kenny should shut up behind the Camera
hes also looking at the ground when he dribbles which is probably not very good in games
Real talk though, if the little guy didn't shoot that last shot that got guarded and ran around him instead then he would've won and a "W" is a "W" little man did good on his far shots
Can wilder plzzz drop this man off
Gotta work on that cardio big dawg
this dude's a disgrace to the game bro...
He did all that just to miss
He definitely played jv in high school
Julian Newman taking notes...
Respect GG
Bro if Gio don’t jus drive and stop doing the exact same dribble move everytime and bricking the 3 I stg😭😭
Meaningless dribbling...
My man did all that dribbling jus to miss the 3😭😭
27 dribble moves, slow down real quick, take a step back and shoot a low percentage deep three.  Every single play. That’s what you want out of a “dribble god”
All that dribbling dont mean shit, he can't shoot for to save his life
That slap noise man😹
if he was a god shooter then every time he dribbles and backup he would be a god.
Dude dribble like he playing 2k only to get a step back 3.
Ok here me out… TJass vs gio
Ken right he did get better that shot Falling now
Gio would be good if he didn’t do all that he has good moves in his bag and he can shoot decent he just dribbles way to much bruh keep that shit simple why do u gotta do allat this ain’t 2K jus use ur handles to do simple moves to get u open stop dribbling like ur 2k17 spam dribbling lmao
This man went to foot locker and was like “hey. What’s your squeakiest pair of shoes.”
He suckssssssss
his jumper is weird
gios jumper makes me cringe
Gio goes nowhere and looks down when he dribbles.
He will literally make somebody not want to guard him or even play again. All this dribbling in place. Julian Newman Jr 😭😭
He can only dribble fast
All he does is make his shoes squeak off the ground bro I swear
He. An play cash but can’t play cam 🤔🥸🤣smh
I can’t wait for flight to react to this 😂😂
did he travel at 7:01 or am I tripping?
That Boy Can Shoot !!!
YESSIR ITS JUUUUUUUNNNNNE🔥🔥🔥
20 ft shots and no moves to the basket? Useless.
Honestly from this vid Gio’s a good pull up shooter his problem is he dribbles to much and goes no where, gets predictable, and his defense is alright
I know dribbling is like his thing but like do it with a purpose 😂 all that pounding the rock to throw up a brick
How this man gonna get beat by a YouTube that plays basketball for fun😂
Aye we know who the shooter is out of them tho 😂
I wanna see zach do a 1v1 on someone
Neighborhood/city/beach + IRL = Gio
Just dribbles no hesitation or faints and sane pattern of dribbles  very repetitive  😪
DUDE LOOKINGIME TALLER JULIAN NEWMAN,HE LOOKS STUPID DONT HE SEE THAT
He’s a bum real hoopers don’t dribble with their head down
Is that the Julian Newman my player skills
Cash giving him room on purpose to make him look good 👎🏼
This dude sux
Gio sucks bro
this boy wanna dribble like kobe amd james harden combined
Bruh he looks down when he dribbled too
u say he has no defense but your a grown man playing a kid
I couldn't 1v1 him because he do to much and he dose to much bullshit
GOOD D CASH! LETS GO!!
LETS GO CASH!!
But can he beat flight tho
Nobody:                           Gio: dribble dribble dribble shoot throw my arm out of socket 😂
Seek Yahuah
He just dribbles until like the defender gets tired of just looking at him not going anywhere and then he shoots
Julien Newman's brother. Gio Newman.
He literally plays like a 2k play shot
This video was twice as long just because of the extra dribbling smh
Finally released
Lmao dude thinks he has Kyrie Irving level handles 😂
spam dribbler
Julian Newman taking notes
If you actually watch the dude he does basic moves , he’s just quick, but his feet literally move more than than ball
All that dribbling for nothing
Go against the professor
4:50 traveling
Bro ur jus giving him clout smh
He can dribble that fast but can’t take it to the rim on cash? This kid don’t know how to play basketball
This has got to be one of the most irritating basketball videos ever
Cam is gonna beat him
He’d actually be pretty shifty if he used a lot of hesi moves and fast cross overs to drive in. I’m sure he’s good it’s probably just for tik tok tbh. But from what i see he usually doesn’t go anywhere 😂
He is fast at going nowhere
Quality over quantity
Lil bro need to stop playing 2k. This is real life
I feel like if cash played dudes big as him he would never win ah game cause he just ok regarding actual skill
See no 30000 bet I
ONE DAY ILL BE PLAYING YOU 1V1🔥
Some of the most basic dribbling 😴
This what happens when you only do standing handle drills
i love how cash calls the top of the key his hot spot when he went 2-9 from there 😂
Cash ik you ainn pay lil bro 3k fa this shit😂
Cash did u put paid promotion on this video to save gio cus he swears he gets paid for every event he does like he’s some entertainer😂😂
he can’t shoot for shit
All that dribbling and not one layup.
cash sucks
you have to pray when gio shoots bc that form bro…
If cash can beat him then that one college player beat him too he fakes his videos
Love how on tiktok he says cash can’t gaurd him but he dribbles in place and shoots a deep 3 😂 nobody’s gaurding garbage like that no Game down low
He’s a taller Julian Newman 😂🤷🏾‍♂️
Gio need to lay off the 2k 😂😂
When he hit cash in the head cash was still looking at his handles 😂☠️
Gio wise is not fast
Fuck he thought he was Mr.Newman😂😂🤦🏽‍♂️
Gio not clutch
50 on trending
I’ve never seen this kid make a drive.
Cash good win but come on you should’ve 12-0 this dude he can’t go anywhere and has literally 0 defense you could’ve just drove the whole game and scored every time
Cash you a hack 🤣🤣🤣
Cash even if he blows by you he has no layup dude and dude if he's hitting his shots why are you still sagging if you stopped settling on jumpers and played defense this would've been a quick 12-0
The ball moving same speed but his body be spazzing 🤣
Does he travel when he’s shuffling his feet like that?
This guy would be cold if he was a lil smarter and had a better shot
I cringed hard af watching this kid dribble
worst basketball player ive ever seen......
guy looks like he watches julian newman highlights too much
Spribbler.
He literally doing the same shit how do people not read him and take the ball from him lol 😂
Gio wise stipple like that he said cause his 2k creation
Riley Freeman in real life
He literally can't cross u he doesn't move when he dribbles
Legends say he's the ultimate PlayShot
Legend says Gio does run at practices at all because he does all his cardio in games...
Cash just doesn’t need to shoot
Old heads biggest nightmare
All that dribbling just to run back to the 3 and miss smh 🤦‍♂️
Nobody gonna say how he got that rademita jump shot
2K21 playshot mf’s be like
𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗰𝗸  𝗠𝗲  𝗡𝗲𝘅𝘁  𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗲  𝗜𝗳  𝗬𝗼𝘂  𝗔𝗿𝗲  𝗕𝗼𝗿𝗲𝗱  𝗯𝗿𝘂𝗵. ●●●●●●●
gio doesn't even have handles . he can't go anywhere and he does the same 3 moves everytime just really fast. and he can't even do those moves smoothly💀💀
That saying is dope rip the real goat
Bro good block
Might as well say 5 dribbles max
Like bro 30+ dribbles just to miss. Crazy
Ong I hate this dude he dribbles wayyyyy to much lmao🥱
bro whoever behind the camera tryna call an owl w allat hoo hoo'ing
that kid is 💯% better than cash on offense
Who else is watching gio vs cam wilder today
Cash made 0 shots the whole game and hit game winner with a shot wtf 😂😭
Cash replayed that rip like he actually grabbed the ball 😂😂 that shit was a foul
Lmao  🤣  curry got these kids whole game messed up lol
he will never play D1 unless he can move with the ball and score
All he does is repeat the same in and out and slows steps back more and more. He ain’t cold don’t let these vids fool you. Bc he doesn’t go anywhere. Press him close and low and close in as he steps back then he ain’t gone have that space cash kept giving him. I’d do em bad y’all boys ain’t no hoopers 😂😭
I don’t like gio but he’s realy good
He just sits and dribbles and he can’t do anything inside the three point line, he not good.
He's dribbling for the pacer test
He’s dribbling with his head down
Dude went 2/8 on threes and screamed wet like water lol okay
just stand there with an arm up for when he shoots lol  he does all that dribbling in one spot no point of chasing him jus gotta put ur arm up and play off him let him do all that dribbling for nothing lol
That block tho
Now he got to play camwilder
9:08 👌🏼
Just drop kick him holy shit
This guy was definitely the coaches son and thought he was the best because his dad was the coach
he aint go nowhere
cash stop skipping leg day
cash stoll mediocre all this training lol
dude weird af
Overdribbling be like
bruh he takes horrible shots, the shots he takes would be open even if he couldn’t dribble like that it just makes me mad to watcj
Did cash pay him the 30k
Maybe spend some time on ya shot
Why after he miss the 3pt for ball first, he put the ad right after 😂
His shot is GAAAARRRBAGE!
MOST INSANE PLAYER
Cash you blood ?
YOOO IT'S A TIKTOK BOI!
Gio dribbles Dribbles some more Step back Dribbles again Step back Another step back Missed 3.
He said “you not tired bro”😂😂
Why tf does he shoot like that
I hate when shoe squeak on concrete
Is he the one dude from that one clip where he dribbled for 10 years then missed
this was the hardest 1v1 i seen in my life
Need to go to 15...
4:11 lmao @ the sparks
If gio developed a mid range he would be a lot better. He’d have a mid range shot at pull it back out and dribble more.
Where's ash haven't seen her in a hot min
Cash crossed him with a basic move & mean while Lío still extra dribbling doing nothing to cash 😂😂
Cash: Would you rather be fast or strong? Kenny: Basketball 👁👄👁
you already know he broke the right stick about 50 times
His leg movement makes it look like he’s dribbling fast but he’s dibbling slow asf
Haha this is funny
Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven amen 🙏🏾
Daily reminder Jesus loves you amen 🙏🏾
Stop shooting on people you don’t need to
bro spamming the same moves isn’t hard😂
if i saw someone hooping with a tik tok shirt imma just leave before they start doing stuff like this
Julian newman 2.0
He dribbling but ain't going nowhere
All that just to miss😂😂
Slightly taller version of Julian Newman
Again the block at 10:45 u could of took it right up & won the game stop playin with this lil boy
All that sauce and no meat😭
Gio looks nervous when he's dribbling.
Cash when u blocked that shot at 4:50 you could of layed that up right away stop taking the shit back
bro he does a crossover and thru the legs then he ... repeats simple ain nun else😂
Am I trippin or was this reposted, cuz I thought I watched it like a week ago
Boy look like 2017 harden💀
It was funny when 8:26 when Gio was spamming and Cash just tipped the ball out that man hand 😂
Bro need to work more on his shooting form, shit broke asl
Squeaky boots can shoot but all that other ish is unesassary. Cash is nasty with his drives and scoring in the paint plus he can shoot. Shout-out both these guys both talented players. Ball is life  A_howie out
Dude just keep dribbling in the same spot and shoot a YOLO LOL😂 I swear I can beat him easily bruh
I’ve been waiting for this moment
All of twitter hates this guy☠️☠️☠️
Let’s see him go against T Jass 👀
This dude is literally one of those anime 2k myplayers
should’ve done 3 dribbles only
gio tried to go for the lay and cash said “get that sh*t outta here😂
He just dribbles no attack
Play shot vs facilitating finisher 😂
Just him dribbling pisses me off 🤦‍♂️
Gio probs spent 80% of his possession outside 3. Cash lazy for sagging and not forcing drives.
he would never survive a 24 second shot clock.
He got hall of fame dribble badge 🤣😂
He is like one of those playmakers on 2k who be hitting random buttons on the controller😭😂
Y’all both are no comp
We all know if there is no cuts cash would destroy him
For everybody saying cash could of won if he had drived in the paint he did drive y'all just cherry picking
He must go through a pair of shoes a month
The way to beat cash, disrespect him at the top of the key and hope he is having a off day, because he will shoot it everytime lmaooo
Just unnecessary shuffling of his feet. Imo. Wasted energy.
Lacking basic fundamentals, just flash. You can try to  get highlights, I'm going to win the game
It’s like watching James harden, but an even worse version😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥 1v1 Cash can't wait to see more 🏀🤙🏿
He ain’t really doing shit but making he’s shoes make noise while going between the legs
Mans is just another Julian Newman
He got these handles 🔥
YOU NEED TO STEP UP
3:30 bro dribbled for 20 seconds for a brick
🍗🏀🍉
all that dribbling and he ain goin no where 🥱
“He didn’t go nowhere.”
Dribbling like that is useless, who's going to say that to Gio?
Cash this is the 1v1 you had to win gg
Literally every dribble is an escape move
But when is gio playing zerobounce and cam?
Bro just needs some speed and strength, get him in the gym and he’s dangerous Idc what the haters say
He a nba 2k Mobile dribbler
He can’t go anywhere for jack but with that shot he could be a solid shooting guard and distract them with that dribbling lmao
That guy is pretty good... but wtf is wrong with his hair... People's styles nowadays...
He probably need to change shoes after every game cause that shoes out sole is gone 😂
Idk it pisses me off that he does all this and still makes his shots😭
I don’t know why people hating he just wants to play basketball like y’all do y’all hatin cause he dribbles the ball like ok his bad for offending y’all
If gio wise done the 3 piont contest he'd only make the shots from the montain dew sign
Cash bro if you could have yammed that thing at 5:02 that would have been craaaazy
his jumper just throws it at the rim
All he does is dribbles for 3 hours then step back 3
he gotta stop saying top of the key when he misses like 95% of the shots he shoots from there. 😐
CASH!!! U TRIED 8 THREE POINT ATTEMPTS AND ONLY MADE 2 BUT DARES 2 SAY WET LIKE WATER?! GET BACK IN THE LAB AND GET UR HOT SPOT BACK 😡😔😟
REACT TO FLIGHT NEW SONG
Apparently everyone in these comments play D1 ball and coach star athletes 24/7 🤣
All that movement for nothing .
He CANT go left you should’ve locked up his right
Bruh y this man walk around with a tiktok shirt
Wow Julian Newman finally graduated high school but ugliest shooting form
u pay him 5k for that?
Who else wants to see Kyrie vs giowise
Bro cudnt even knock off cash tf he thibk he gon do against cam bro a goofy
He basically like a Julian Newman 2.0
Being fast is better than being stronger speed kills duh 🙄 lol
All im seeing is him just moving his feet quick. Basically just doing hesi non stop. If he learns the rest to do something with the hesi or to shoot better he can def improve a ton.
This dude sucks the only thing good about him is the sound of his shoes is a little bit intimidating🤣🤣
I hate how he plays, its mad extra. However, if he gets more explosiveness or becomes a hesi god, he will be decent.
Great Defense!!!
Thats cool. He squeaks his shoes a lot while he dribbles normally, goes nowhere and misses most shots. Dang... hes good........
*Человек, который читает мой коментарий, желаю крепкого здоровья тебе и твоей семье!*
All these ads lol
Look like a rooster
This guy aint even good he just stays there and dribbles and look at that shooting form that thing more broke than me
Gio is the definition and looks like a Effin weirdo man. His antics speaks for itself . Clown energy
Now u understand Kenny
Gio form gross but he cash with it
cash shouldn’t have shot it once. he could’ve just done layups and 12-0
Flight react to this all he is going to say is that’s my type of shot
i swear i would hate to be gio parents growing up! wasting all that shoes
Kenny and Zach: don’t hurt him Also Kenny and Zach: but still do what u gotta do😂
Shoooooooot
Why do y’all allow him to get open he don’t go nowhere
What happened to Cash And Ash
Like you can walk and dribble guy
Never seen a tree be built b4
Dudes fit said “Bashnasty” shoulda got em to kall folk Bash all game
He looks 16
Cash better than LeSoap
Bro is just doing the same dribbles over and over, moving no where
He dribbled and don’t go no where i don’t even play ball like that and i gladly clamp that gio kid up
Let him lift weights w you cash take him under your wing teach him to drive
He dribbled kinda fast but he really just moves his feet into two positions and alternates that  He probably just worked on that type of combo
You did him like that cash??? Awe mannn dropped him off have a good day yeeeeettt
guys we saw the video stop commentating
You’re big body to him cash
Do him a favor cash let him lift weights w you. Take him under your wings. Teach him to drive the ball teach him an Iverson crossover
Ma I need new shoes Why I driibbled
All I gotta say is he is going to be the new gio
Cash idk you evolving to a hooper hooper?
The itchy wasp rarely flap because birthday jekely curl athwart a volatile loan. colossal, wretched temple
He really thought we were gonna check his socials
THE SCORE WAS 4-4 CASH SHOOTS THE UGLIEST REESE SHOT IVE EVER SEEEEN 🤯🤯😅😅😅YIKESSSS
Is that.. is that.. Julian Newman 😂😂
Yu always travel when yu stop dribbling in the post when yu get under the rim cash
All that dribble to stay in the same spot!!!! He definitely Idolizes Julian Newman!!!!
The one three he made was on game
Throw it off his head just to get blocked lmao
God Bless everybody reading this God Loves y’all🙌🏽✝️❤️🙏🏽 God Bless you and your Family and make sure to give Glory to Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and put your Trust, Faith, and Love into him and believe Jesus Christ is Lord and is the Son of Our Most High God🙌🏽❤️✝️GOD BLESS AMEN 🙏

If you want to react to flight reacts song cash you should if not you don’t have too
Cash bro u coulda won that along time ago Dont make me sauce you now he got alla speed boost but wasting his energy and ion hatin I’m just sayin
Literally Julian Newman 2.0😂
Me watching this when I could barely hold a basket ball....
Worst player ever
I suck at dribbling..
He the guy at the gym nobody wanna guard but will end up talking all crap if he hits one shot
What is that guy doing why is he shaking like that
When u try to show off for girls

Dude is tap dancing... all that and still can’t create space.
Ur top of the key suck
You know this man run through at least ten pairs of sneakers every month 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Waiting on flight to react 🤣
Flighg was a hater that was a good game
Internet Ref!!! What do you think?  Did cash traveled at 7:50???
I’m getting teen Gohan vibes from Gio.
I’d like Gio Wise go against TJass.
gio can’t lay up
Flight literally dribbles like him
Gio: dribbling at the 3 point line   Cash: 👁👄👁 like are u drive in or nah ?
He needs to add a spin to that cross then he can take off
Waisted energy
I don't wanna sound like a hater and don't mean too much disrespect but....  The kid isn't dribbling real crazy rather he moves his feet twice as much as he needs to.  Every now and then I see him hit on a decent cross over but that kid is the definition of doing waaaaay too much for a bucket lol
That man Cash brought it out the vault 😂😂
How u let this bum score 10
All that just to miss 🥱🤦🏽‍♂️💀
James Harden vs Playmaking shot creater
Smh 😂😂😂😂
Sheshhhhhh

Man really just dribbling in place
He’s wearing a tiktok shirt 😭😭
Dude with skunk hair travels alot
He didn’t go nowhere
This dude a playmaking shot creator in real life, just dribble for like 20 seconds and shoot lol
Gio has the form of a fifth grader
Just press up on gio when he starts doing them extra dribbles throw him off and pick the ball I play people like him everytime
Made one three the whole game lol
Dude why he say he go nowhere
All that dribbling does nothing
He tried to violate my boy cash n got that shit pinned 😭😭😭

Lets give cash respect top of the key is his end of the discussion💯
If you beat him then cam will do it with ease
Way to use that X or square button on these Curry drill hackers.....the F I'm talking about Cash!!!!!!!!!! Reach, reach Reeeeeeach! 💥 (Mickey voice from Rocky)
He made space but made his shot harder, how couldn't cash guard him
cash u paid 30,000 for him 😹?
You played hard for that W! 🤣🤣🤣 Cuzzo gassed you out! Lol
Cash really got better
Y'all don't want none.....!!!!!!!
Just play the shooting hand all the extra dribbling for nothing
he’s literally not good
I mean if he’s making money from people hating on him...I guess that’s ok..?
damn cash, you payed him 5k just to pull up ?
Ian gon lie gio nice breh niggas hating 😭
Cash think is hot sauce mix with Tupac lol
This nigga cash traveled every time he did a hesi
Yeah flash will always beat the beast because flash could run lol
Kid wears himself out without taking one step forward.... in a full-court 'real' game, he'd be laying on the court gasping for air in 10 minutes.
I foll
Bro just stop dribbling
Cash work on your cardio dayumm, always out of breath and your opponents aren't breathing heavy at all lol tf
The evasive pear steadily guard because water ophthalmoscopically use during a satisfying touch. low, second-hand beauty
Paint Beast Vs Playshot😂
That dribbling shit is goofy 😂 he’s not strong, can’t shoot under pressure... literally nothing impressive about this goofball
Cash Nasty is really not good
1v1 James Harden
Never watching a Geo NotWise video goodbye but I’ll drop a like even though I don’t like this kid
What!?! What he know about a stormtroopers!?!
Aye for now on we only like it if cash hit it from the top of the key 😤😂‼️
1713 angel number
You better win dis one fam
Cash mainly scored in paint but still gg love u bro no homo
Nobody:   Cash “You not tired bro” 💀😭😂
How does he still have grip on those shoes
This dude cash hit us with a sponsor out of nowhere lmao
3:00
I feel like people don’t give this kid enough credit. I mean yeah he dribbles WAY more than he needs to and doesn’t really go anywhere with it but he still has the handles and a really nice shot 🤷‍♂️
This guy  dribbling like his girl just pulled up 😭😭😭
I see a whole lot of nothing going on
@2:30 “you help build one tree” I thought trees grew bruh
Listen to gio dribble but with no volume, anit as impressive now huh?
He dribbles a lot and goes nowhere but he was hitting dem shots gotta hand it to him
Gio looks like he having a seizure
9:21 anyone else see that electrical spark 😂😅
Julian Newman got some comp
"Dribble dribble dribble dribble dribble dribble" as shaq would say
cash u a bum
Julian Newman 🤣🤣
The reason everyone hates this dude is cuz he tryna look like jake paul and be kyrie yet he hitting people on the head with the basketball, and the TikTok shirts makes it 10x worse.
When you press all buttons on nba2k
When he dribbles fast in one place it looks like hes getting a panic attack
BRO IS IT JUST ME 0:59 to 1:03 it looks like he has a panic attack?
I'mputtingwordstogetherbecauseitlooksjustasbadasmymansshootingskill
Cash making goo look like a 5th grader in the paint
This kid just makes a lot of foot noise no fuckin cap
I just watched this kid dribble more times than klay has in his career 😂
@camwilder
Al that dribbling and ain’t go no where lmao. Easy af to guard
This man is the real life version of the 2k Playmaking Shot 😂
Julian Newman type beat
He doesn’t even dribble while looking up. Why do they even bother playing him 😂
bruhhh if he would do a move and go he would be hard to guard
Why the hell his shoes that loud
Dude plays just like Julian Newman
is there a legit reason bruh stays stationary? lol i'm really curious
Did you pay him 5k to show up?
He moves his feet 100 mph just to not play defense🤣🤣. He shoots like THE GAME
Bruhh
Lol
all you need to do is stand still and he boxed
Why tf are you giving this dude clout...
I can't stand watching that youngboy play that s*** is ridiculous none of what he's doing has a purpose just dumb s***
He’s not shooting he’s throwing up the ball 💀
Can he do any crossovers? Or he just spam dribbles?
That jersey gave him power RIP KOBE
Ik gio felt like he was dead when he got blocked..I felt it coming..he was doing that all game and cash chose to react when he needed to the most
Cashnasty the last brickbender 🧱
I'm not a hater butt the old heads are are right you dribble too much
Somebody put a dribble limit on this dude
GS
Ay hes better than I thought he was ngl.. cash still took the dub tho 😎
Bruh cam wilder was right of irl he shy asl
This game made me mad Ngl u got cash missing easy layups and he can’t shoot and the other dude doing unnecessary dribble moves
Why do you keep shooting 3s?
Where I'm from u cant win by two.. just like how u cheated when ur foot was on the line in that other game.
Cash got a chicken wing fade
He looks like those stock Toyota corola with straight pipe that sounds fast but don’t go anywhere
It's fun to watch
Let’s go cash you the 🐐 bro I watch your videos all the time good w 🔥🔥🔥
This is what a slashing playmaker would look like in real life lol
he just likes shuffling his feet...
Damn, as a former D1 pg this kid is...absolutely garbage
cash 1v1 duke denis
Man isn’t even good lmao
Just play close d he doesn’t move and loses the ball every time
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates 🎈
Gio wise spam dribbles more than people do in 2k
If Gio wise was as fast as he is quick he’d be ok. If cash nasty can guard him on a drive to the rim imagine real hoopers
Follow through with your shot cash!
For sure I'll bring a chair if I was his teammate
What is that jump shot
How does one build a tree?
Tbh when I really think about i understand why he had d1 offers. When the only weakness you have is in defense in the paint you have centers and other people their to stop people from backing you down and stuff. He’s not bad
This dude just look goofy as fuck
Man cash sucks and he’s out of shape
To see if he really training stick a hand between all that dribbling see what he really about
I remember when I use to dribble like this... He really not going anywhere...
1:06 he didn’t go nowhere😂
cash don’t know that he can’t literally just stand there and not move. Then when he does his step back step to the shot, like what
Dude can shoot
I know you don’t be sayin Cuh & got that rag on yo head 👎🏽
Is it just me or every time I see this guy he got the exact same shorts on or am I tweaking 🤔
Score is currently 4-6   *cash played more physical against adin*
Bro just leave that bum open
Nigga play basketball like Julian newman
Dude dribbles for 2 mins
“Includes payed promotion” I see cash tryna pay sum bills
in all seriousness, imagine how good he would be if he got shifty
This man gio spams his right stick up on 2k... I can tell
these dudes have no idea how to play the sport of basketball
☺️😍
Bro gio is garbage
Gio literally real life version of 2k my park point guard
This is probably the most edited video that I’ve ever seen cash make😂
Dude is literally every playmaking shot on 2k lol
zero bounce would shit on him
I want to see him play Flightreacts 😂
this dude plays the same way 10 year olds play in park. bunch of random dribbles for no reason then a 3
He should learn playing like that did nothing for Julian Newman
aw man this vid is like one month old :(
Cash 8 point he travel
I don’t think cash knows water isn’t wet because at the end he said “wet like water” but water ain’t wet🤔😂
Spams size-up animation
Mans like Julian Newman but more shittier
You not tired bro?🤣 best part of the video
Bro tryna be like Professor😂
cash nasty got better too
Bruh got diamond handles for days but cash got diamond 0 cares
Cash was not playing around lol
any body noticed the edited sparks under his feet😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
His shoes move quicker than the ball just to make it seem like he’s dribbling fast 😂
Wtfff is this kid on bruh 😂😂
This man the play sharp from 2k18 but with no shot
Julian Newman's son  be like
He's like the guy in school that thinks he's a baller just because he can dribble fast
This man tryna unlock ankle breaker in real life
Play Cam wilder cash
Why doesn’t gio actually play basketball instead of real life 2k
Gio should be in 2hype
Julian Oldman
That dribbling is cracking me tf up 😂😂
Bro that man has unlimited stamina mans dribbling like that and not getting tired
I had to skip gio's possesions. I cant watch someone ruin the beautiful game of basketball like that
Gio is absolute garbage
Bro needs to stop shooting. He ain’t like that dude went 2-10 at the 3
Bro I love how cash went straight into the sponsorship of the video right after Gio threw up a brick 😭😂
no disrespect buh i feel like i could beat cash
LEEEEEEETTTTSSSSSSSSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I don't understand why Cash wasn't driving every single time. The dude can't defend and his dribbling is only good in one spot. He isn't mobile with his dribbling.
NIGGA JUST WAIT TILL HE MOVES EZ BOX 📦
Runik 2k
gio juss dribble he cant shoot ill leave em open whole game
He was making them shots on Kenny
He can’t even drive up
I still don’t know if he left or right handed
2k sweats be like
When the only dribble animation you have on is a size up
🤣🤣 Gio reminds me of Julian Newman over dribbling for no reason LMFAO, dude stop it  you are looking foolish.
Sponsor right after his brick lol
That boy Gio jus be dribbling down Kenton hairline. He be dribbling to far back
For This game all cash needed to do was to keep on driving, he didin't need the threes this game
I cant cap cash u lowkey suck for letting score 10 cause he list to a ramdom that vapes and that kid locked him up
The smack at 4:40 ! 😂🤣
Why are u shooting flight
I want to see him go against professor
10dribbles per second
Interviewer: "who did you look up to growing up"  Gio Wise: "Oh man i would have to go with 2k"
All gio does is movie his feet in one place and does regular handle moves
Yesirrr
hes literally the definiton of 2k dribbler😂
he plays like the only basketball hes ever watched in his life is park in 2k 💀
gio needa get in the gym witchu
Looking like flight 😂
Can’t take this kid seriously dude does all these dribble moves without moving and shoots threes💀💀💀
This guy is lokey a knock Julian Newman
I wonder if the ball ever went over that big wall on right side of the goal
Didn’t even have to watch the video, I fast forward to the end and already knew I was gonna hear cash talk about “I had to drive on him”
he playing everyone but cam
He’s pretty fast
Damn y’all really making fun of him like that 😂😂
you build trees
His 10 was more impressive than your 12 only because he can’t shoot
He not even doing nun fr
Gio easy to guard all u gotta do don't let him get 2 feet of distance between yall and it will be hard for him since he's more of a shooter and got a really good range and jumper. Everytime he is about to a shot he tries to give himself a lot of space between him and his opponent.
He’s just dribbling for cardio 😂
mans does the same dribble combo thinking its actually effective LMFAOOOO
If cashnasty lose im unsubbing
This dude reminds me of the dude that gets 0 assists and 5 points 3 reb
Son doing to much he gon get tired fast asf
He like a damn comp stage 2k guard🥵
I can’t imagine this dude playing in a gym with squeaky shoes on. My ears will fall off.
It’s not even fast, it’s just his feet he moves it really quickly that’s why it would look like he is dribbling very fast but he’s not.
Damn cash I almost unsubbed for this one 👀👀👀👀👀👀👀
Stop hating on bro, most of y’all can’t even guard him💯😂
Man said every time you buy a poster you help build a tree 🤣
The fearful fearless share unlikely scrape because mint sicily rinse mid a squeamish doll. woozy, stereotyped probation
This kid is cool but honestly you have to do more then that if you hooping with anyone with a basketball IQ
Bandana cash
Dribbles 200,000 time and get nowhere lol
Dudes jumper uglee af
Yo every one is roasting this mans head tops lol
He seems like a good kid, but that spamming pisses me off man can't even lie
All he’s doing is squeaking  his shoes on the court
Mans dribbled, Threw the ball off cash head, drove and got that shit swatted LMAOO
gio is weird with his broke a$$ jumper. this guy gets payed 5000 to dribble nothing else.
What’s really the point of dribbling THIS MUCH? Can we please talk about it?
Cash’s one dribble move was more effective then all of this clowns moves
Went like water 💧
He play like riley on his first game from boondocks😂
Yeah gio ain't beating cam wilder
Gio is like a playshot in 2K that only isos.
Is he Julian Newman's cousin or something?
He nots even fast it’s just his shoes make a lot of noise 😂😂😂
dribbling like that is just not basketball fair enough to him for learning that but noooooooooooo
Give cash his respect wet like water 💦
Wtf is this kid doing 🤣
Y’all all hatin but I’m ngl, if bro went somewhere with his dribble he’d be good ash
i swear if cash just drived every game he played instead of shooting guy would like never lose
How does cash play on this court daily and still shoot 1/10 from the top of the key that he claims is his hot spot
Cash should’ve just drove and posted up the whole game
everytime cash finna loose if hes playing sumbody smaller hes definitely finna start playing bully ball in the paint
Dik cok dribblers smh
Lol it has to be a brain thing with him thinking that him dribbling fast shakes defenders cause it doesn’t. Shaking defenders you gotta move, you dribbling in place doesn’t do anything. Idk why he doesn’t work on it.
Cash got a ray allen shot it's straight gio got jumpshot 38 mixed with Steph Curry am I wrong
Who ready for cam vs gio
I Don’t like what he does on tiktok and all that clout chasing and shit but come on yall, he’s actually good offensively at basketball, his range and if u play yo high he can blow past u
He only a shoots full bars
Dis nigga gio literally lost the game cuz he jus dribbling too much  he can shoot but he jus needs to make his moves more effective cuz I definitely would've beat Cash ian gon cap🤣😂
his handles are good its just not useful
He needs to quit trying to act cool dribbling the whole time and drive in
Cash was only shooting to get the vid over 10 mins 🤫😂
He also has a bad shooting form 😂
Bro does the bad release animation from 2k when he shoots💀
Gios jumpshot takes like 5 minutes to load
Man can’t even look up while dribbling smh
Hey i know his dribbling is kinda pointless but he has a good handle and his looks weird but obviously it works respect he gave a run for his money
All that  dribbling is all just to get you to focus on the dribbles to he can make a step jumper he not doing anything
Plus that game was close too
"he aint go no where"
It's funny how Cash say he has zero defense yet that man is a tooth pick checking you like bruh 😂
Gio has to be taking crack before he plays
My dude jumpshot looks like his back be hurting
He dribbling like it’s 2k17 😂
He not even doing nothing with the rock like shoot the ball and miss already ..
Bruh can’t even dribble properly. No purpose when he dribbles he just looks stupid haha
If gio wise wants such a troll he could have potential
↗⬅↘⬆⬅⤴↘↔ and missed
Gio was the last pick in pe
He’s like julian newman
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WHATS GOOD EVERYBODYYY
Cash needs to get better after this match up. He looked desperate for the post and took advantage of his strength instead of techniques. He got tired fast 🤣
Travel 7:48
Eff yo sponsors Cash
Nobody: Gio.notwise: when in doubt, dribble it out
He not dribbling super fast he just moves his feet fast when he does it
Litty 💪🏿🖤vid the best you played bro but bro got dribbles wish I had can’t hate
“He didn’t go nowhere”😂
good game cash but your 4th point was a travel 4:48
I’ll bust cash in ball
Gio vs Newman 1v1 would be crazy. 2 most hated hoopers of all time😂
Cash it’s June get that easy money from flight already bro bro
Cash made a comeback, kept the lead, and got the game winner. It might've been tied a couple times but he still got the dub.
The way gio dribbles is disrespectful to basketball
That gio just dribbles in a same spot. That's all... he ain't good
how does gio expect to beat cam when he can’t be cash
Cash wining
I never seen cash go for this many steals
How to play basketball be Julian Newman L0L head bounces cash 4:31
this little geek plays like Julian Newman LMAOOOOOOOO
Bruh gio not like that he just do the same shit in the same spot
Buddy dribble too much, I’d bench him for SURE!
barely beat a tik toker
I WONDER IF HE MADE YOU PAY HIM 30,000
Legit just don’t take jumpers on him play tight defense and just contest his shors
he cant even dribble with his eyes up
Gio probably asked cash to edit some of his misses out the video like he did with cam 😂
There's alot of good basketball players in this world but this tiktok baller is being real humble
Unnecessary inefficient energy wasting dribbles, absolutely no threat driving to the rim, only shoots long threes(isn’t consistent), shot is very easy to contest because of long it takes him to wind up. Basically Julian Newman but much worse Bc Julian can drive to the rim
He seems like he just likes to hear his shoes haha
Wet like water
The only thing I don't understand is what dribbling does while standing still, the meaning of this?
He plays no d
We got the cheap trae young vs the cheap lebron 🤣 ily cash
Cash got a nice left hand
It was over the moment that child threw the ball off cash’s head.
Gio look like he sell overpriced candy out his bookbag
This dude not d1 he to small but that can improve as well as his defense
He basically a Julian Newman 😂😂😂
Cash for the win even tho u could have been better on defense
Yes cash
This kid goes nowhere
Hes feet are moving 100 mph in the same spot.Julian Newman technique.😀😀😀 But going no where.
Gio Newman
If cash won cam for sure winning
Dude can't shake a defender to save his life. All that fancy crap in the same spot dropping lucky 3 point shots with the form of an elementary school kid. Not impressed at all. Never heard of him either.
Cash shows once again...all muscle little skill
Son literally dribbles like these iso niggas in 2k😂
I wanna punch the shit out of people who dribble like that
8:14 N ✨ O✨W ✨ H ✨ E ✨ R ✨ E ✨
Cash I hope u ain’t lose
All you have to do is not reach. Dude has a worse shot then Andre Roberson
Mans put all stats into dribbling and nothing else 😂
RIP LIL LOADED
RIP LIL LOADED
Kid ain’t even half way decent. Same moves and not going a damn place
That's how I dribble. Then I realized its unnecessary af but now bro...i just need 3 moves and boom crossed then imma just pass or drive to the hoop.but still you don't need to cross someone. Just try to get space then pass Lemme tell ya sum.. Don't spam dribble pls. You don't go nowhere
😂don’t hurt him he’s still a kid” Cash- “but he playing like a grown man thoe” 😂😂
I am 99% sure this man is traveling 😂
walmart Julian Newman
dudes a poor mans julian newman
If he having a good game with cash then I doubt he beat camwlider
Technically, cash did steal, YEEEEEEE
Heess tooo smallll
Littt my guyy
this is y mypark isnt my thing 😂😂😂😂
This was kinda embarrassing
Dude is literally spam dribbling for nothing. Wasting stamina 🤣
He suck
The next clout chaser in hooping, man studied flight
3 dribble challenge against gio bet he can’t make hun shake 🤣🤣
That rewind was hella demonic
Stop hating on the guy he still gonna clap you and that’s facts
He can’t even make a shot to save his life. All dribble for no reason
1:01 “He didn’t go nowhere” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cameraman: He still a kid  Cash: He playing like a Grown Man tho  😭
One word: Scuffed asl
Yo gio spamming right stick HARD
That jit run through some shoes ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
Jit sorry asl .. all that damn dribbling & ain’t going nowhere
If Gio won lol
Seek Jesus whole heartedly trust great is ur prize in heaven and turn from sin  and walk a walk with Jesus
lets go cash
Yo does Julian Newman have a son?
LETS GET IT CASHHHHH!!!!!!! Easy dub🗣💯👑
Gio plays like playshots on 2k who think they can iso but they go nowhere and use curry slide as their bailout
Fire edit need more like this🔥🔥!
BRUH THIS SHIT CRAZY ASF I JUS HAD A DREAM ABOUT A Tiger THIS MORNING n i com to ur YouTube channel to watch u play Basketball and you got tigers hung up On ur Wall 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
He needs to stop dribbling and get to the rim.
3:37 at this point cash just askin for another sus compilation😂
0:40 let’s dude cash already happen on this dude out the gate😂😂
Kid reminds me of Julian Newman. 🤫
gio da opp
Pov: you watched flight react first
Did cash have to pay this man to play
Wet like watuhhhhh top of the key 🔑 🔥
That’s not basketball lol bruh just dribble in one spot like he on 2k lol
TikTok dude not  even good

Spamming the controls 😂
3:15 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
pov you Heard cash say oh shit
I love all these coaches in the comments like shi why y’all not pro yet👀
This is not 2k
Did 1k dribble moves just to brick those shots, wow.
He a play shot with 10 shooting badges
The kid is nice i feel like he could’ve won already if he didn’t over dribble😂
Gio’s dribbles ain’t even that good
I really don’t like this dude Gio
Of tik tok was a basketball player it would be this kid
I def was looking for something to put on my walls
Cash was playin with him, he could've 12-0'd him by just going the rim, would've never lost the ball. Cash's dribble moves are more effective with less effort.
Moochie shitting himself Rn
Cash has good shot but he hyping that shit up too much to miss 15 and hit one to win the game.
imagine Gio in wise in the nba
Let’s go Cash!!!!!!!!!
He still a kid tho 😂😂😭😭
Cmon cash! Only way u actually win is cuz u keep going for lay ups 🤷🏻‍♂️ what happen to the top of the key!
All that dribbling for nothing
Wednesday 5:00 against cam wilder don’t forget gio
8:13 the moment I've been expecting
All that dribbling just to miss half the shots
Yo gio wise vs T jass
After Gio first play I clicked off the video, that shit gave me a headache 😂
cash got facial hair 17 of 2k lmaoo
All that dribbling and he can’t even get a blow by?
He dribble like flight reacts but faster
HEAR ME OUT FLIGHT IS WANT TO 1v1 HIM NO DOUBT
It’s aggravating watching this man 🤦🏾‍♂️
He didn’t read the scouting report Top Of The Key Wet Like Water.
Tht dude was doin the same combos and dribbled in the same spot most of the time
That’s crazy but 😂 omg, flight coming June 👀
He threw it off his head 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Why does he shoot like a 4th grader😂😂
Still waiting on the hooper, hooper hooper and hoopist list mayn
W
Try not to hurt that kid cash 😂
I’m making cash shoot the whole game
The gio kid cant shoot though
Bro stats be max dribble 0 everything else smh
He is like julian newman, he dribbles un the same spot
Maaaaaayn 5 mins in I could tell this man to little. GET BIG LIL HOMIE.
Hello 2021
This like a Julian Newman
true definition of play shot vs slashing playmaker😭🤷🏽‍♂️
Gio does the most when he dribbling
More like “Bricks like New Jersey”
I'm waiting for Flight to react and Cash to reply and... yeah y'all know what I'm talking about Also: Cash was 2/5 or 2/6 on top of the key 😬
Gio has to be switching shoes everyday
Jesus love you all
Tbh he doing the same moves
Bruh dribbling for no reason .. can only shoot .. and feet move to much on D .. gio newman
IT'S JUUUUUNE I call next game JuneFlight VS DaCashnasty
bring him lifting
I knew it was over when he threw it on cash’s head 💪🏾
All gio did is make noise with his shoes and drible the ball without going anywhere
4:58 I see youuu. You talked about doing that move.
Cash I don’t even know why you waste ur time with this 🤡
Cash should’ve brought his umbrella the way Gio was making it rain 3s on him
All that dribble and can’t even get around a defender.  All Cash had to do was back that fool up in the paint all day.
When he dribbles he does not go anywhere and his form looks like he’s gunna throw his arm out of socket every time
Playmaking shots
Lil man made alot more harder shots the cash with all them lays on a lil guy yall should play only shooting no lay up see who wins
We all talm bout how he just dribbles and not go anywhere but we don't take the time to give him props for deep shooting ability🔥. P.S: Imagine if this man could shoot mid-ranges and finish strong in the paint🤔.
Professor vs gio wise
This man cash goes 2-8 from three and still says top of the key hotspot 🤦🏾‍♂️
Glad you posted that promo definitely checking them out after this vid
Play a little defence on him and he seems to fall apart.
Bro This guy legit dribbles Stepback 3 Thas it
I was bout to say cash gotta klutch up with the kobe jersey on
Dude suck
Please I’m Begging Please Pull Up Too Sanford Florida & 1v1 Me Please. Bring Kenny With You, I’ll 1v1 Him Too
He’s not fast at all he’s quick
His shot form reflects his game
CASH O'NASTYYYYYYYYY 😤 😤 😤 😤 😤 😤 😤
Gios hair moves more than his defender
all those dribbles and he stayed in the same place. any real hooper would just watch his hip movements and lock him up lol
Dude is doing Julian Newman dribble...not cool
He’s a prodigy 🔥
Bruh cash goes like 2-9 and acts like he a hooper hooper
this isnt basketball 🤢
The worst dribble in basketball ots a mockery to real talent. But hey we live in the era of gimmicks over actual talent.
Bro I used to know gio In highschool that kid made a fuckin come up he was short as fuck but he could always shoot the shit out the ball
Cash gonna get cooked but that’s why I clicked
Been trying to play cash for months
i have noticed that cash only starts driving when is about to loose or there is a big score gap
That 99 ovr e3 that’s bout to hit legend
Nice game homie
Gio wise got no handles, I can do all that as well and just as fast. He also got no finish
The kid looks like Mikey Williams from the side
That boy stay spamming
Spam dribbler hahhahahahahah
When cash reacts to flight reacting to this he's gonna say flight man give me some respect it was a beautiful miss but you wouldn't understand cause ur a hoop and high
This guy worse than Flight 😂
He gonna give you that 30k he be talkin bout on his tiktok🤣🤣
The thirsty pond approximately soothe because pen phylogenitically deceive notwithstanding a tame slope. successful, swanky puppy
Theres no way cash let him bounce the ball off his head thats fighting moves cuh
His jumping is worse than London ball on a bad day.
His jump shot uglier than yours Cash
Gio dribbles    Cash: “He didn’t go nowhere”
Playmaker vs glass cleaner 😂
it looks good but thats getting locked up viciously by anyone with good defense, all that dribbling gone get him tired and once he does step up and trap him.. he wanna look fancy on the court rather than try to win
LETS GO CASH
Idk what it is but every time gio get the ball I skip the video
Just told him like it is "you got 0 defense" cold 😂😂😂
bro goes through a pair of shoes per week
Is this a reupload ?
that hair gotta go 😭
He make all the noise just to dribble the ball
i hate people like that
20% aint a hotspot, even tho thats ur highest %, its still not a hotspot.
8:20 why u flexing after the ball slips out his hand? u r his son and he aint even half yo age
Omg cash stop tryna be like bron and big body niggas 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
julian oldman 2.0
Still has that middle school form but he can be lethal if he fixes his shot
Gio out here look like a 2k park rat mixed with draymond
dude is like Simmons wears a shooting sleeve and only makes lucky shots apart from that he cant shoot
That shooting form needs some help
Cash nasty footwork tho on the triple threat
When Cash miss Top Of The Key Cash- EDDIE!!!!! LOL
For future references, you always call the winning score first!!!
4:35 bruh😂😂😂
FOLLOW YOUR SHOT CASH
Dude reminds me of flight wit them spam dribbles that don’t get u anywhere 😭😭😭
Stop saying wet like water your shot has never been that
That jumpshot is the worst I have èverrrrrr seen  Cash nastys is clean tho I like his one
“The hand was up but I just didn’t give a fuck” 😂😂
Dribbling like that don’t mean much if you can’t create space or finish!
Julian Newman 2.0
This kids handles are useless LOL and his shooting form is questionable
just dribble to dribble, not dribbling to blow by or make space. kid could've won.
Stop saying top of the ki nigga. All you put up is brick
Imagine being on this dude’s team
Julian Newman but worse🤣
They hate on him because he can dribble through his legs fast and they can’t
Gio literally trolls doe
All these niggas keep letting cash win I might have to step in 💀
That is a great video to do in life right know today okay.
Come on now Gio is not a betta spam dribbler then me i can Dribble betta then him and shoot betta than Steph curry on his best days if yall want me to prove that I will Start making videos on my Youtube Channel😌
😂Damn cash you should have kept that to yourself you just have to tell him like aye yo you have no defense😂 But gio he dribble the ball way too much and he needs to start taking the ball in after he do his behind the back dribble crossover
Mans bought only 2k dribble animations and can’t shoot
Who’s shoes he wearing shits clean asf
Dude gio sucks 😆 🤣 😂 😹 he dribbles for no reason.
Bruh these cashnasty 1v1 be predictable
The hooper that does 10 moves at once but doesn’t go anywhere
Worst 1v1.
Man my nephew will cross him
Flight gotta play Gio like if you agree
Stop playing with Gio jit live asf 😂💯
Nicee
He just moving his feet a lot to make I look like he doing sum
He was dribbling tooo much for me to watch the whole 1v1🤣I’m very impatient
Gio would be nice if he just stop bsing
When he threw it at Cash’s head that was disrespectful you dont do that
1v1 Cinco
I gon literally smack him if he throws the ball to my head bruhh 😂
Can’t wait to see flight react to this lol
gio won
Cash some shit
He is NOT fast dude slow as hell lmao
Fact or Cap: Dribbling = 99, Shooting = 87, Driving = Straight 💩, and last but not least, Defense = Straight Garbage 💩
He isn’t that nice
cash cmon man how you let him drop 10 😂
cash woulda won 12-0 if he drived every time
Cash I’m in the middle of the video if you lose I’m unsubing

Thank god cash got a win now we can stay here let’s learn from this cash ur black with muscles and can jump high if u miss a 3 just drive for times in a row b4 u take another 3 u will thank me later 💪🏾
I’m lowkey surprised that cash didn’t throw the ball back off his head
How you let him score 10
I'm ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᶦⁿᵍ ᵗᵒ ᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵒⁿᵉ ʷʰᵒ ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᵉˢ ᵗᵒ ᵐᵉ ᵃⁿᵈ ˡᶦᵏᵉˢ ᵗʰᶦˢ ᶜᵒᵐᵐᵉⁿᵗ …
I’ve never wanted to punch someone for their play style until gio
Yooo no bull shitt I think cash should go against hezigod
It's like playing a real life 2k character
dribble dude sucks lol
I mean cash has no skill all he was doing is backing down
Charles Barkley said all he do is dribble dribble dribble dribble
The way he just promoted himself at the end like that
💪🏼
Lets gooooo
Flight finna skip the sponsor 😭
"the hand was up but I just didn't give a fuck"-cashnasty 2021
If he played up on him he woulda blocked every push shot.
yo that defense from cash on the last play tho 🔥
I would wanna see  Tjass vs Gio.wise 1v1
Cash has the worst playstyle bro
i'm gio hieght maybe shorter and i'll drop him off 11-0 ONG
He dribbles like a 2k19 playsharp
Gio:throws off cashes head Cash:and I took that personally
Look up all that for nothing in the dictionary spam dribbler goin have a pic right there dribbling

Spam dribbler be having me dying 🤣😭😂💀 nice handles but always miss this kid is a genius lmao
This nigga only do in betweens and the right hand hesi in all his games
dang cash talking about kenny but his d on the 3 is just the same, non existent.
"Wen he said u got 0 defense" 😂😂😂😂
I've seen this video before. Julian Newman 2.0. Good luck Kid. You better have a strong social media presence.
Dude wasted all of his stamina bar and had the gatorade symbol coming up after his first possession
Wet like wattaaaaa 💦
cash real for not driving in every time on him to make it fun
Much love dog ✊
If he could cross them up or do a move and go to the paint or sum and not just dribble in one spot he would be nice 💯
“He didn’t go no where “😂😂😂😂
Nobody:   Cash: wet like wata  🏀 🧱
Cash really let this little boy throw the ball of his head bro lmao, I’m ngl my respect for Cash went 📉📉📉 a whole lot 🤦‍♂️
how does he say he beat cam wilder but loses to cash?😭
Man cash getting too old for this
Kenny always in the videos ..... SHOW US SOME DUNKS MY GUY .
All offense but no defense get this guy outts here 🤣🤣🤣
This spamming dude ain’t makin shit  .
yesssirrr i knew u wouldnt go down like da cashhh lls
Lowkey this what happens when u grow up watching Julian Newman 🤣
“He didn’t go nowhere 🥁 “ 😂😂😂
I know having dribble moves is good but in the nba a nigga will not do what gio does
Do he deadass play like this or is it just satire to be funny?
whats wrong with his hair he looks like a golden retriever that went into the mud
Flight gonna have a hayday with this one😭😭
Who still where’s elite arm sleeves 🤮🤮
Cash you trying to blood bro you all tough and strong with muscles but a gun make you say sorry
Good to see Cash is doing Make-a-Wish with kids now
I need a Gio vs Julian Newman
Julian newman is still relevant
gio plays like he goin for 2k mixtape dribblegod clips
All he did is a fast behind the legs behind the back and shuffle his feet damn this kid aint going nowhere with his dribbles but backwards
Tik tok is for 12 year old girls its sad if u use it
Nobody : 2k19 players : dribble noises intensifys
He’d have a lot more success shooting the ball like an adult 😂 that boy need some muscle he shooting from to low super easy to defend. Great skill forsure kids a baller none the less !
hooper that lifts in the gym vs hooper that spends gym time dribbling the whole time
Luv the 1v1s Cash 💵🔥🔥 know they help pay the bills 🤣
Dude reminds me of Julian😂😂 they dribble but they don’t go nowhere 😴
Imagine if their was a shot clock 💀😭
If you’re somebody with long arms, all you have to do is stick a hand between his knees. And it’s over.
Cash play no comp
what’s shoes is gio wearing
Ayooooooooooooo " I’m getting too thick for these videos " Whaaaaaaaaaat
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man I already know how flight going to be when he reacts to this video.
How tall are both you guys ?
In this court, who has beaten Cash yet? I’m actually curious..
He didn’t go nowhere 😂😂😂😂
Big Dubs baby
He crosses him self up bro, If he keeps going his hair will feel off 🤣🤣
Cash said "Kenny he wasn't makin them shots when he was playing you" 🤣🤣🤣
This what happens when drugs takeover kids
He doesn’t even dribble much  all he does is shuffle his feet and makes it sound like he’s doing more that what he actually is
Cash looking like LeBron
Aye man if Gio was smarter with his movements, he could be nasty
2/6 top of da key . hot spot turning cold
Gio kid truly is w3ird lol Tuff times don't last tuff ppl do huh Cash. U been lurkin me eye see u 👁️
It’s not over when you lose it’s over when you quit. That message should be sent to LeBron James
He was hitting but what the fuck was that form on the shot
😂
In the intro he like 🧍🏼
Bro this kid got unlimited stamina
Does same move over and over easier than a book
Hate that his name is Gio WISE but he’s not wise with his dribbles 😭😭
why didnt you just baby him the whole game
Gio got a lil bit more stronger her would have won that game
Play him 3 dribbles limit he not gonna score shit
bro this guy just moving the right joystick😭😭
He don’t really dribble fast he just moving his feet making a lot of noise
Irish spring green grennnnnnnn
this boy thinks he is a 99ovr character playing in the park ☠️☠️☠️☠️
Gio tryna break Casper the ghost ankle
He don’t go no where and he looks down anyone can look down spam dribbles and throw a shot up it takes more skill to use less dribble and more smarter dribbles which have purpose and to look at the rim which dribbling
Garbosa
Gio's foot work is unpredictable
Capek liatnya
Cash wearing a wig
😰🤭
Yous cappin at the end
He’s a hooper hooper
😐
Lil buddy just like a 2k player do the same moves
It like we watched  kyrie vs lebron

Cash had two for eight shooting in the hotspot
This gotta be the worst 1v1 I’ve ever seen
Let’s goooo caaasssssshhhhhhhh

HE DOES ALL DAT JUST TO MISS
Swear to god y’all better look at the bottom of the net when y’all shoot
Gios next vid: how I beat cash nasty
Bro watching you take layups the whole game is not entertaining 🤦🏾‍♂️💯
As soon as cash losing you already know he just gonna go to the paint with no skill just muscle 😭
Kinda corny. Cash played off and when the man went to go by Cash don’t cut him off, he just pushes , lol.
“He didn’t go nowhere.”😂FACTS!!!

Been wait for fucking ever
kid can be cold if he just learn to drive n get some skrength
This dude Gio has negative basketball iq
He do too much, idk if he hated he need to just play regular ball and stop being weird 😂
If cash had to shoot the whole time... he would’ve got fried😂😂🤦🏽‍♂️
NGL if I 1v1 him I don't even know how to guard I just stand still
Gio been grinding been with him since day one, now to see him be able to 1v1 against Cash ✊✊
That was a good game cash but I wish I could play y’all and Gio and kn I would be a good game me and him like Wsp
I love these 1v1's imma need mine soon enough Cash
Cash please read this message is it me or does Kenny want Giso to win
4:14 he uses all his strength for that shot 🤣

This flight if he refined his skills a bit
That handle is crazy but wtf is that form bro 😭
Gio don’t wanna drive for non
Hi

lmao he said yea i got no defense wtf
He literally plays how 2k21 Playmaking Shot Creators Play.
yo hell nah why he take that back off a tip at the end take that shit to the rack cash
Did anyone see the light purple splash at 9:22 on the video
Come on now...we all know he better than Jillian Newman
Cash u suck 100

It just looks like he goes through a lot of shoes 😄
All that to do absolutely nothing
All thar dribbling not going anywhere
Finally
Dam cash talk your shit you beat a hoopest

his jump shot lol
Looks like cash need some more cardio work
Wth man 🤣🤣🤣
Cash could’ve easily 12-0 him if he kept driving
R.R.R.T.T.T.T.T.Y.
Cash a d1 hooper now
this dude doesn’t go anywhere with his dribble and the shooting form with the push shot
All he does is better steps
I BET GIO CAN TAKE ALLEN IVERSON HE WILL GET FK UPPPPPP
Cant stand him i might have to swing if i see him do any of that
Why give him a platform
Did u pay him 5k?
when you disrespect cash, you be sorry lmao
Cash i almost got disgusted by you
shouldve been 12-4 cash... stop playing with your food
Just waiting for flights reaction who else waiting
Haven't finished the video, does cash realize that he has to prepare to guard his jump shot when he's a foot away from the 3 point line
as a hooper this video pissed me off
He really doesn't dribble all that fast he moves his feet a lot but he can shoot off the dribble pretty good
Cash you gotta leave ya form up when you shoot
he said he gets paid 30,000 how much u pay him cash
Cash thinks he got hof intimidator to just look at him on defense 💀
I finally dunked!! Thank you for being a inspiration Cash
Those displate thingamajiggs r fax doe
Cash could’ve dropped him 12-0 if he drived the whole game but he gotta make the game longer
No lie is man was a 2k person his dm will be like 9999999 but his shoot will be like 78
Gio is a 2k spam in the flesh 🤣🤣🤣
Cash can't shoot for shit.....still
Cash please you have a decent shot but your more of a slasher than 3 point specialist your drives to the hoop are much more impressive than your threes
Listen gio could be the next legendary dribbler taking professors spot but he needs to slow down
Cant wait till cash reacts to flights reactions
Cash a blood?
Cash went try hard when he bounced the ball off his head
They ain’t no way Gio wore an arm sleeve to a pick up game of 1v1
Flightreacts
Jesus why Gio dribbling low key piss me off
Basketball is a simple game, put the ball in the hoop. Buddy is making it too hard😂😂😂
Bro if you loose to cash how you go beat cam smh
Dude watch cash brick after brick and he guard him close. I don’t get it
Finally I miss the edits in your 1v1s you went Hollywood
He just dribble and does nothing else.
kid
Manz wint no ware
damn it’s a lot of hate in these comments and and 80% percent of y’all would lose to this nigga😳 ion see how people hate not me though y’all be safe out here
that kind can not shoot lmao 😂
I can take kenny chao and gio wise at the same time. they don't have aspen stamina
Bro only has handling badges
If I was as bad as cash I would be self coinscious to play b-ball. But the fact that he’s confident gives me inspiration 🤣
Dude is 🗑. All dribbling for no reason.
Cash your 8th point was a travel. U switched pivot Foots
That was a heck of a block
Gio wise isn't serious is he
This win needed a “I think I got my swagger back” 😪💯
Can’t wait to see flight try to hate on this
Classic YouTuber vs TikToker
AS SOON AS HE BOUNCE OFF MY DOME....WE POSTING HIM UP EVERY SINGLE PLAY!!!!!!
Thought it was to 15
He doesn’t know how to get to the rack
If he knows how to use the dribbles gio would be god tier but he jus spamming them
Gio jus shoots he sucks
Perfect time to upload this cash smart getting them views up to pay more bills cash if you see this tell me if I'm wrong
DONT SAY G*D D*M THATS USING GODS NAME IN VAIN AND THATS CURSING

DONT SAY OH MY G*D THATS USING GODS NAME IN VAIN
DONT SAY OH MY G*D THATS USING GODS NAME IN VAIN
Can't do anything but dribble lol and hit those deep 3s. No D
TOP OF THE KEY
People don’t understand he dribbles like that as a joke it’s satire but he is really skilled
This kid only got the between the legs animations equipped 🤣🤣 he’s a bum frfr wtf 🤦🏻‍♂️
In the thumbnail he looks like kyle kuz
DONT SAY G*D D*M THATS USING GODS NAME IN VAIN AND THATS CURSING
DONT SAY G*D D*M THATS USING GODS NAME IN VAIN AND THATS CURSING
Yea dont hurt em 🤣🤣🤣 like zack said 🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀
Flights gotta react to this shi lmao he gonna crack n cash for only laying up
this kid is just a taller julian newman...
All that damn dribbling and ain’t going nowhere 😭😭🚮
Nba2k     cash clamps hall of Fame
One thing you can give cash credit for is he stay hitting his game point threes💯
I like how you think it’s ok that he knows where you live 😳
If cash wins Gio might as well jus give cam tha money
If U bum him it’s over
9:04 cash traveled that bucket dont count
He does the same dribble moves
That kids handles aren't good he just does between the left leg between the right leg crossover behind the back and doesn't go anywhere😂😂😂
The dude with the two color hair looks the rim prior to shooting
All that dribbling for no reason
Dis nigga just said “build a tree” 😹😹
Irl playshot 😭🤦🏾
Sir….all that dribbling to miss lol
People b really hatin on bro like who cares if bro dibbles and goes nowhere🤣🤣😐 he havin fun w it
Gio could be really good if he practiced on different things besides dribbling
Cash could win 1 v 1 with anyone that’s smaller than him. Just bully in the paint
Cash lost all his respect when he through the ball at his head
He’s actually a very good player, I don’t think people understand he’s a troll.
Lol now I know why this kid is the most hated on Tik tok
TOP OF THE KEYYYYYYYYY🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
CLAMPPPS 8:15
All that compression gear for what
I would have no respect if cash lost to this bum
How much does the posters cost? Genuinely wondering 🤔
Damn cash has gotten legitimately good at b ball he would just fool around in years past
I wouldn't let a dude like that drop 10 all you gotta do is press up on him bc he ain't going no where and remeber to put a hand up when he shoots but should be a greater chance of him missing🤷🏾‍♂️
He didn’t go anywhere CLASIC
Play like that always gg and u clutch
Cash wit the footwork!!🙌🏾
All cash do is drive 😂
Dude remind me of Riley off of boondocks off of that One episode all he do is dribble but can’t shoot 😂
Literally all his shot came from the wing followed by a hop step going backwards. Surprise Cash didn’t catch on, but still got the dub tho
This guy weird
TOP OF THE KEY BAYBEEEEE
15?
CASH BEEN PAYING THEM BILLS LATELY
Wet like water? < wetter than tres leches cake 🍰
I think people don't understand that because you don't shoot threes all the time, doesn't mean that it's not apart of basketball. But even if, it's a lower percentage shot.
Cash sitting on that bro
Gio vs professor
The best part of this video is the part where I learned about Displate.  I already put an order in.
💸 if you ran as much as you lift weights you'd be raw
the fact that he got 10 on cash shows how bad his defense has gotten ☠️☠️☠️
I could beat him and I'm not even 18 He's not really special. He's just predictable.
That’s not real basketball
0 defense
He’s just like flight but a faster crab dribbler
Waiting on Flight 1v1 TIk Toker
Straight banger 🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
Cash said wet like water more than gio dribbled
yo thats kenny dobs
Not finishing this video stop playin little kids if your just gonna back them down in the paint
He’s JUST a dribbler that’s all that’s it 🤦🏾‍♂️but good video tho Cash big fan
He had cashnasty in a Michael Jackson thriller video 😂😂😂😂😂
All that dribbling ain’t called for bro. Get to the hoop!!
Way tooo much dribblin, he just stands there and dribbles. What's the point if you aren't  going forward? At least cash gets to the rim
Good question,  Super speed or super strength?!
GIO plays like the standstill dribblers on 2k
He got cashnasty on subway surfer mode😂😂😂😂😂
Gio just dripples to dribble exhausting more stamina and not doesnt get nowhere by dribbling he stays in place, 🗑 not good
reupload?
Lost to cash thinking he finna beat cash no offense good shit cash
Cash really let this man hit the ball of his head
DON'T sleep on Displate
I’ll drop cash off
It lit there
A
I know his shoes hate him 😆
This man said it’s gonna take 31k to go against him… GMFU
I can’t tell if this is how he actually plays or if he’s just spam dribbling for content
Lol
Time to pay some bills 😏
I know it lit
Thank you for dropping him off! No DEFENSE like HARDEN‼️😀😀😀😎😎😎👍👍👍
Million dolla moves 10 cent finish
I don’t like that dude but you gotta give him credit for never messing up the dribble going that fast
Cash u carry a lot tell me if I’m wrong
IDC bro, dribbling too much doesn't impress me
My guy dribbles like flight they never go anywhere
He made the video 5 seconds longer with that slow motion replay😭😭
came to the comments when he threw the ball off cash head😭
LETS GOOO CASH
he need to play the perfessor
lol Cash lost this, remember that 2v2 Cash ?? "he didn't score on me"... but the first shot he made you said "what you want me to do", as if kenny wasn't telling you that the whole game, smh
Get out there damn cash!! Wet! Like! Waaaatttaaa!
He don’t do nun crazy it’s simply dribble moves that anyone could do all he doin is choppin his feet while he do it...  But he still ain’t goin nowhere
Cash actually really one of the best YT hoopers . Cant take it from him; defense, he can shoot if he wants but he bodies his way to the paint most of the paint . Big salute 💪🏼💯
This dude doesn’t go anywhere it’s like when u play with a ball hog on park
yeah don’t go to rim
lmao they were right, he’s jus a lil kid thinks this is 2k
Worst than Julian Newman
Why do I want to punch that guy just by his hair
stop playing w cash boy
Thank god cash put this dribble man in his place
His jumpshot🤢 better put in the same work he does on his handles with his jumpshot
Gio is playmaking playmaking lol
bro he can dribble but he is lookin down the wholl time.
he dribbling and not goin no where
🙏🏾✝️
I wanna see gio 1v1 with a 5 dribble max
Julian newman and gio should collab fr
🔥🔥🔥
Ayeeee that sponser was nice tho im definitely fina order some no cap
He doesn’t really even really spam dribble he’s just quick on his feet
8:39 dude had an open lay to the left but still went back to his right 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
man cash tell him to stop dribbling like that
kenny be hating. he be always be hypin up the person cash playing but cash his own homeboy
Just the fact that he came from tiktok and reminds everyone of julian newman he gets instantly hated, seems like a pretty chill dude tbh.
Does nobody ever do their homework and realize that cash CAN’T go right.
An yeah he do be spam dribbling he don't go nowhere but it throws you off the amount of dribbles he actually does lol
What is that shooting form 😭😭
Bro love cash no homo but he’s not a shooter like he’s gotten a lot better no doubt but he’s not a shooter
If Gio spun at 8:41 to the inside it would have been absolutely filthy
Gios dogshit
Cash got that on 🔒
At the end i was just yelling top of the key cash
All that dribbling 🙄🙄
It's crazy cause Gio appears to be cheeks but he has insane handles, he just needs to learn how to finish and actually execute moves after starting them
I can’t wait for flight to react to this
This kid got unlimited boost I would be tired gasping for air dribbling like that
Who else skipped to the end
I wish people would realize gio content is satire he does it cause it gives him views he doesn’t actually play like this
Cash......... stop playing with the free ones.
Dude shoot like Draymond Green his shot had no business going in that many times
if ur gonna spam dribble atleast go somewhere like kyrie for ex
Top of the key
Only if bro would pick his head up while dribbling 😂 the TikTok dribbler would probably be kinda nice on the court
hes litterally just julian newman he sucks hes not even playing basketball lmao
Bro if he was just a lil faster off the dribble my guy could be a demon he still young and he could level up
Bruh spam dribbled me into an AD…Bruhhhh
the fact that u let him score is disappointing
It’s always a bad sign when Cash make his first shot from the top of the key
Gio play to much 2k bruh
Bruh he could actually be good but he spends to much energy dribbling like damn
He is not over 6ft
The thumbnail is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Next: flight vs gio wise
Cash be hacking.  When someone is about to get past his he reaches out to hold them back...  That's cool for someone your size, but not when it is that much of a discrepancy
Gio need new shoes every game
3:24 he didn't go Kno where 🤣
I hear Flightreacts grabbing his Scooby Snacks!
dude this kid needs to get off 2k, that shit doesn't work in real life lmao. Just do a couple moves then shoot like damn.
flight be like...
Handle for days on platinum
He's playing more of a mind game with the speedy dribbling and sloppy hesi but not bad i guess lol
I get he got famous off the fast dribble shit but why do it in a actual game. Dribbling fast in one spot is not handles dawg
Gio getting smacked by cam and zero bounce
All he does is spam dribbles then waits for u to sag off or steps back a couple steps and shoots
Gio travels every time he skids his feet around while dribbling. He takes 3 or 4 steps with those skids and it would be called in high school, college and nba. If the kid just cooled it on the spam shit and worked on his shooting form he could be an average basketball player that gets at least a drop of respect on the court. The kids weird bro.
He’s a tick tock basketball player all that dribbling ain’t going no where
cash i havent started the video yet but if you lose ima be disappointed 😭😭
reacting rn as we speak 😈
He walked a couple times 😂
All them dribbles for no reason
Cash yo hezi getting crazy
He's embarassing the basketball community
Cash yo offense like a c-
Tracy Reynolds versus Calvin Cambridge lol
Gio only choose the playmaking pie chart 😂
“Don’t hurt him ... but do what you gotta do” lmao
Is it just me that feels like he over does it and looks funny 😄 and tries too hard
Yessir cash
Cash went 2-7 on top of the key and thought it was wet every time😂😂
cash game is 🔥
Playshot vs p lock😂😂
if cash postin this dude up tho this kid got no chance
this video is bouts to do numbers
Cash is still playing scrubs. What happened to his hooper-hooper dream?
This man don't even got good dribble moves he just spams crossovers and behind the backs
Cold
Y'all jealous cause y'all not better than gio 🤣🤣 look at perfesser like y hate!?🤣
This kid found out what 2k was before real basketball 🤦‍♂️
Gio is a waste of society.
Ay honestly cash fuck a shooting coach you need a defensive coach
Cash 🤦‍♂️ stop calling top key hotspot
Cash thinks he’s good going 2 for 87 from three and only scoring off driving on a 80 pound dude😂
This cookies
no cap cash was geting worked all love though
Why he shoot like that 😂😂
Cash let a pro stick spammer clock 10 points smh
Cam wilder was not cappin... this kid awkward af
🎺that’s all I hear
The most overrated defender on YouTube: cashnasty.       “I can’t look bad, I can’t get crossed”    I thought u had clamps
Yessaahhh
9:10 had me rollin😂😂😂
Ok I see ya 👌🏾
You should 1v1 the professor
Hes really fast at making his shoes squeak..
Dude dribble and stays in the same spot 🤣🤣
Cash taking his sweet time every time gio checking up to catch his breathe
“The hand was up but, i just didnt gaf😂😂
Yo cash I haven't watched the video yet, but if u lose to gio u down bad
Cash keeps all the other hoopers in check 💪
As much as I love cash I will not watch a video with this dude in it😂😭
He’s doing 3 moves between the legs crossover and behind the back
It looks like he was showing he ain’t go nowhere
Shot. Clock.
LeBron Nasty🔥🔥🔥🏀
Talk about disrespect  take thats jersey  off 😤  he would be disgusted cash nasty bully someone up one size lol u go to the rack every possession  dudes all of 130lbs up a disgrace  and yea any real hooper is sitting on cash nasty hot spot didn't look real hot bud

Bro everybody would love to see flight play him bro no cap
9 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
Flight vs gio
Cash is better than Kenny 0.6🤣🤣🤣🤣😭
This man is a pro Julian Newman impersonator
This guy is cap all the way begs people to lose
He does all the dribbling and still be boxed/goes no where. doing all tht dribbling for nun
CASH I ROCK WITH THE CURLY HAIR !!!!
If cash lost 😖
Why you not play the legend himself Kenny dobbs
All that unnecessary dribbling Gio is doing.
He got length of this legs. N not using it to pass you staying in one spot smh
doesnt even look up when he dribbles lol
He dribbles like Flight but much faster and under control.
YEH😎
This man gio really ducking cam wilder bro like play him already pussy!!
Y the game even close
Gio is just a 2k spam dribble to the step back three
Making 2 3s wet like water
Lowkey flight can be better than cash since he’s taller and cash has no versatility in his game.
Y’all dis on em Bt he would beat most of y’all 💀
4:40 i live for moments like that
Kid to stiff if he wasn’t he be good ssl
That was actually a worth while sponsorship lmao
Give this man hall of fame tight handles
This man travel every time he dribble 😂
Mans paying his bills with the long intro lmao
Another quote is hard work beats talent that doesn’t work hard
QUIT GIVING THIS CLOWN A FOLLOWING! HES A GOOF
Bro gio just waits for u to miss then spams like a offensive threat in stage 😭
This kid fucking blows besides three point shooting, can’t even dribble well or that fast he just moves his feet a lot
Jeez this guys handles are insane!
RIP the grip on them shoes
ITS ALMOST JUUUUUUUUNE!!!!!
Cash real life showed a replay of him fouling the kid as a defensive highlight 😭😭 i seen it all
He the definition of “Doing too much”
Dude is weird af and hoops weird af
yo bro u can not dress lol
His dribbles literally create no space 😂😂😂, I hope you he don’t think he good
That dude honestly does too much... And miss all the fucking time
Gio in a 3 dribble kings court?? 👀
I like your game cash jus dribble to get to your point hate players that do all that dribbling for a brick 😂
Need some Gatorade boost cash
can’t wait till flight reacts to this
I would cook cash 😭😭😭
imagine flight going against Gio Wise...
Cash, how is this even close, my respect went down
Bro shuffles his feet more than dribbles
Tbh hip movement is way more important than these fancy dribbling moves that only go backwards
Yo cash he almost beat you with straight jumpers 🤦🏻‍♂️
Gio shoot like when my mom throwing a ball
Bru this nigga not even doing nothing 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
He shuffles his feet more than he dribbles
Cash game winner was lucky just like lebrons was against the warriors 😂😂😂
9:21 what was that
Tf is this
You trippin! I wouldn’t shoot not a jump Shot on him! Straight drive. He plays 0 DEFENSE
What’s the point in dribbling if you can’t even creat space or get by anyone 😂
Lol you’re not a hooper cash you almost lost to gio. You’re sorry as hell bro😂😂.
Gio like all the playshots in 2k
Drop this at the perfect time lmao
gio settled for terrible shots instead of trying to go to the hoop
Cash getting better. 5 mins in and the handle looks easier, controlled, and pretty clean. Using his body well on the rip through too. Good stuff 💪
3:32 lmaoooo knew that was gonna happen.
Gio wise vs TJass?!?!?!?!?? 😳😳😳
Cashnasty back like cr***
Gio can only shoot he has no defense he his offense first
He’s dribbling and going nowhere
Cash he shouldn’t be scoring 10 at all
Big body travel
Cash u gotta stop wearing them bandanas g u don’t wanna be sending the wrong message
“Don’t hurt him” is why I hate playing with older people. Just cause ima kid don’t mean I don’t want the smoke on that court. If I’m playing my all then I want the other to play there all to.
The only reason it looks fast is because he is like shuffling his feet
The relief after that block was real🤣 Edit: then the bucket 🙌🏾
Cash your jumper
cash a blood today
This shouldn’t have been close lol😂
All u gotta do is force him left. Cant do anything going left
Cash is tha clutches YouTuber💯
I cant waut till cash react to this
Cash is bigger than Gio he could easily go in the paint and post him up or drive by him but he kept shooting top of the key shots that he's like 2/6 33%. He needs to stop shooting over 5 shots from 3 cuz that's not him.
Tiktoks niggas catchn Ls fo life.
Honestly i feel like this kid is just doing it for the memes and actually baiting ppl to get views, like he popped out of nowhere and now is doing collabs with famous youtubers.
All he do is dribble the same moves.
Gio gotta get a new pair of shoes he gonna have no traction 😂
Ok cash a blood today
LET GOOOOOOO CASH!!!
Look, everyone is hating on gio but it’s a great strategy.  Make the other person fall asleep and then shoot,      And miss, shit
“ damn that mf wet” for some reason that shit had me dead , cash too funny 😂
Your opponent is shity as fuck bro what the hell is he doing
Cash u could’ve 12-0 dude if u just took it to the rack everytime, u act like shooting is what ur best at, use ur strength to ur advantage and stop chucking up dumbass shots
*6:55** CASH LET ME FINDOUT YOU LOST TO THIS MANS😂*
Gio makes me not want to play basketball
I wonder how much shoes gio goes through
cash cant win with out the paint thats why its hard to guard him
*GOD DAMN CASH ALL THESE DAMN ADS* 💀😂
when he hit that ball on his head i know hood cash wanted to come out
All that dribbling and he couldn't get a blow by
Cash always has that lebron clutch 3🔥🔥
3 times in a row and you still give him top of the key
Time to pay sum bills mane
Bruh gio sits there and spams the same moves that’s why on Wednesday cam is gonna beat him and ion stay in Arizona but the people that are coming to the park takeover and watching them 1v1 don’t get there late because cam will take the W in 5 minutes I say that because cam is a 6”5 d1 hooper when gio is a 5”7 hooper/influencer
Cash need some oxygen
I will neva let cash top of the key smh 🦾 wet like water 💦
Bro cash should have won by way more
I know that heesy made Cash upset😂I would be too that dude shootin bricks
Best notification of the month
Anyone no what’s a good basketball for outside that last a long time ?
Cash just chillin
i actually hate gio 😭😭
Gio could be such a good player if he stopped dribbling like julian newman and learned how to dribble efficiently
Sponge bobs shoes
Cash might be the greatest hooper. Not skill wised but, he stay winning most of his games.
9:07 travel
Cash needs to keep his pivoting foot down bc he keeps on traveling love the vid tho
Cash is getting this eazy W
You really improve your Skills cash WET LIKE WATAAAA💦

ugliest jumper
9:34 I can already see Flight saying "Cash you're down horrendous" XD

3:35 cash is already outta breathe haha
Ugliest damn game I've watched...who is that dude  dribbling the ball, looking like Ronald McDonald...dude has the ugliest n most pointless game ever
9:09 is a travel but ok (picked up his pivot foot)
Julian Newman 2.0

I just laugh at him😭 dude sucks man spams the dribble stick to get a full white
Why dribble like that🚮

He acts like he gets a dollar for every time he dribbles the ball
He’s not tired because he’s having fun
Who u think i am
Gio is bad
Does this kid thinking spamming dribble moves is gonna get him to the league😂😂
He could never play organized basketball, he would get cut in the first practice
CASH ALMOST LOST TO GIO WISE. YOU ARE A DISGRACE CASH
This is like Lebron vs Curry
LETS GOOOO
1/5 top of the key cmon cash
Cash isn’t a good defender bruh if u let this bum score 10 man I’m 5’3 but would lock tf outta both of yall
Low key cash should have hit him with the dropstep
He just dribbles to dribble, he doesn’t actually go anywhere with it except backwards
Title should have been: How someone should play vs how someone shouldn’t play
Time pay some bills 😂😂 from watching it
Cash finally uploaded this 3 weeks later 😭
Gio’s doing he’s awkward eye thing agian lmfaooo
This like Steph curry vs lebron
Did he ask you to pay 5k to play him
Blocknasty is back yeeeeeee
bro would actually be good if he moved forward i swear
This dude is literally Julian Newman 2.0 lol We all know what 2k player he got
Just like in the 2k Park
Cash From The Logo Reminds Me Of My Favorite Idol The King 🤘🏾💯🔥
Julian gio new man
Gio definitely up there ☠️
Cash, when you drove to the rack on I saw you put your arm around him to make sure he couldn't contest. I remember you reacted to one of Dev's videos and you said you were gonna use that. That shows improvement. 👍🏾
He just does the same shit over and over he’s not that good lol
That dude sucks...
Maaan he is like one of those cheesy play shots from 2k 😂
Yessssssss
Banger
Cash i see u finessin when u made it 8-8 at 7-8 u moved your pivot foot i see u🤣🤣🤣👀 9:06 look back bro
All you gotta do is stand right in front of him to stop him.
He has more useless dribbling than Kenny 😂😂, I hope Marcellus Howard thinks the same
Cash gotta work on the hotspot shots
Bro sounds like happy feet
Every dribble that’s how many bills he has to pay
“I’m getting too thicc for these videos” - Cash Nasty 2021
I wanna see meechie terry guard gio but Ws only cash💪
Imagine Cash losing this
Gio literally goes nowhere when he dribbles. Not hard to defend.
The squeaking 😆
Mannn I was bout to say cash you gone let him do all that on you helll naaaaaa
Gio vs flight
Yo i kno this man gio has to run through his shoes after like 2 hoop sessions with all that squeaking… his soles done
Bro his displate posters are definitely in a hotel 😭🤣🤣
He doesn’t take mid range shots only 3s and layups
Is cash not uploading some games or something, he legit wins every time
I love the name of the video
FAST = STRONG at least in baseball
Lmfao all that bouncing first possession and he misses 😂😂
Good player but to much dribbling
When he bounced the ball on cash head I know cash was not having it
@7:50 isnt that a travel he moved his pivet before dribbling
wow wait a minute not even 10 secs in. WTF kind if resistence band was that?
He stay spamming but he's not going anywhere. Whether he was going somewhere or not, Cash had him in jail
Not watching tik tok
This dude's adrenaline be rushing every time he dribbles
Good W
And this kid actually thinks he’s gonna beat zero and cam 😂😂
W for 3
I love your videos and I been turned on post  Notifications
Gio sorry
At the push of a button… I just payed this mans bills :)
“Don’t hurt him”,  aye all bets are off once you hit me in my head with that ball😂
Gio's jumpshot is absolutely disgusting 🤮🤮🤮
Wet like water 💦!!!!!
Nobody: me using Kyrie Irving
Doing all that just to get clamped
We all know he don’t go nowhere. Can we talk about his hair tho?😂 like what’s going on with all that?
You had to pay 30k to play him?
Someone fix tht boy jumper it look broke
i dont mean to be a hater bruh but dudes dribbling fast for nothing lmao he legit goes no where
“We are helping out the environment too, killing two birds with one stone” wrong choice of words😭
When it was 10-10 I start thinking bout dat time when cash like boom boom boom boom reputations on lineeee 😂
Tmr is the day
Why this dude always wearin the same tik tok shirt
This is actually what I’ve been waiting for😌
They played till 12 even tho they said 15 bruh
Nigga lost all the grip on his shoes in on one possession
Looks like he just do the same dribble over and over again. You can already tell he’s not a drive in person. He does his dribble and just shoot. If you have a big and strong body like cash all you do he just post him up and used your body to drive in and score. Hes going to dribble dribble step back and shoot. He did that most of time. Can’t wait if your going to do that cash has 2 block. If someone lock him he’s not going to drive in he’s going dribble step back shoot.
Thank god cash got a sponsor, he need to pay them bills
4:32 When your little brother hits you
I swear all you have to do is just drive on Gio dude has no defense and on offense mans basically does the same combination no hate tho just critique
Dude did a million moves and went no where
Cash’s 3 point rating is a solid 74 but in his head 99
U suck for letting it be that close bro
This guy sucks cmon cash u gotta get back in the gym
Cash when you miss it actually pisses me off!
Your dad always tells you not to dribble to much
Cash paying 30k to play him
I respect Gio now
It’s bc he dribble to much
The off the head tho dribble off cash head tho 🤦🏽‍♂️😂

TikTok vs YouTubers basketball 🤷🏾
Thank fuck you won

No hate but Gio if you see this please take time to work on your shot form God bro that form  is disgusting work less on handles more on your shot
Cash said Wet like water but goes 2 of 10 from 3🙄🙄
Cash lowkey got a quick step n a nice hesi cross over!🤷🏾‍♂️💯
We paying bills today 😈
Gio has that high school lamelo ball jumpshot
Gio is a play shot without the screens by that un needed dribbling
Cash it wouldn’t have even been close if you drove every time he couldn’t guard your drive
I would give cash top of the key shot every single time, still don’t know why he considers himself a good shooter at the easiest 3-point spot
😂gio didn’t get better he throwing up prayers
yessir💪🏽
Gio not even good cash better clamp up
Cash you travel when you do your turn around hook shot because you pick up your pivit foot but nobody sees it or calls it. If you work on your footwork you will be fine
How you that strong and get tired that easy cash🤦🏾‍♂️
If Cash didn’t settle and just took it to the rack he would’ve zipped Gio
Buddy doing all the dribbling and can’t even go left
Man watching this was lowkey frustrating. If Gio could string together that size up with a behind the back, hesi and a cross he'd be close to unguardable in games like this. Curry has helped the game, but in some ways he's caused kids like that to focus too much on his dribbling drills and shooting deep. Like Dell ain't even let steph and seth practice shooting until they were solid af when it came to fundamentals. Kids need to understand that.
He doesn’t even go anywhere he’s dribbling with no purpose
This man wear the same shirt every time 😭💯
am i the only one noticing he’s doing the same move between tween cross over crossover ?
Top of the key all day
Rn it’s June 1st in the U.K. can’t wait for Flight 🔥🤣
I swear to God, if you put a hand down while he's dribbling you gon get the ball in yo hands
Why he shoot with quick release  lol
Hey cash did u have to pay him 5k to 1v1
Damn bro, gio got the ball of off cash's missed jumpshot and he already dribbling nowhere
8:44 he be looking like the playmaking shot creator in 2k21 that’s how they dribble 😂
He do dribble Weird but aye we all do thing's different 🤷🏾‍♂️
Dude basically a Playmaker no shooting badges 🤣🤣🤣
oh we building trees now?
It’s just like a point guard vs center if u play up it’s a blow by and you play off he gonna spark it
Gio thinks he can beat Cam Wilder? CAPPER
he can probably beat jesser  in a 3pt contest
Cash lookin like a hooper hooper doing some good moves👀
CASH YOUR A WINNER MAN Gg man
He did the same move the whole time
Those dribbles useless dawg lmaooo
CASH SHOULDVE DROVE EVERY SINGLE PLAY
I fucks with ya Cash, but you literally only beat a kid by pushing him around. Damn sure can't respect that one at all. 💯
Cash always ends his games with a top of the key shot idk why
Might need a haircut to see where he wanna dribble to
All of that dribbling for what ? 🤦🏽‍♂️
4:34 look to that dumbass hahaha
I've never heard of this dude why does everyone hate him?

🔥🔥🔥
Off the heezy cash 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Clamps on Hall Of Fame!
Cash it is taking everything I have to watch u play him
Cash Lowkey got me worried thought he was finna lose, Gio was lowkey cashing out tho, lets be honest Cash ain't a good defender anymore 💯
Damn, we “building” trees now in 2021
3:30 bruh

I low key like the 3 sound effect good edits
Dribble for no reason
Cash u better not lose
1st possession Cash: no dribble pull up splash  Gio: 52 dribble (yes I counted)step back brick
Gio dribble just like Julian Newman 😂
Gio dribble like that one dude who always shows off when a group of girls walk in the school gym in P.E.😭😭😭😭
Bro too disrespectful throwing that at cash’s forehead, i saw hood cash in his eyes for a second😳
On god bruh, i would kill Gio Wise! Y'all let me know if y'all want me to play him.
did u pay him to show up ?
How is cash way taller than gio when cash is 5ft10 and gio is 5ft9
gio spam dribble of course cash i going to be warn out
I been watching your reacts channel and I been seeing Flight games and you are most of the time disappointed and if I get the training time that flight get am gonna be better and you gave me confident to challenge other I play outdoor not a YouTuber but I like that when you said Flight YOU BENN LIFTING THE WRONG THING that was the funny part I’ve ever heard from somebody. Keep it up and we out here to support you love your videos .
cash you let him score HOW MUCH? bro I’m dropping you off bro... that kid is actually fucking awful
Cash dribble just like lebron
Whoever his trainer is, is terrible
Rip Kobe bean Bryant
Lmao under the right circumstances cash a easier drop off than flight
Gio has an awful first step
Cash took it easy on gio he’s a good dribbler but he shows the ball too much and if you a real hooper you know what I mean but I give cash props he could’ve played physical d and just took his cookies every time but he didn’t he let him cook 💯😆😆😆
I love how cash was 1-5 from his “hotspot”
YE
Ik Flight finna be talking mad shit  Its almost    Juneee
2 for 7 top of the who
Ruining the GIO name
I’d probably get crosses over by the time he did two steps 😂
Maybe if this kid honestly spent less time throwing the ball between his legs 7 times before moving and spent more trying to actually get open he would be good, his stamina obviously is good he doesn’t ever really look tired
Good game but stop backing people down
Nice game
This kid needs to focus on shooting the basketball (the point of the game) than just dribbling the whole time
Junnneeeeee Flight coming soon
Cash I watched through ALL the ads to get you the most money for dem bills🔥🤑
As soon as I seen the kobe all-star fit. I knew what time it was.
Noway you let him score 10 on you
do all that dribbling and miss
Gio is too hated yes he looks stupid and his dribbling doesn’t do anything but he can shot and has a solid handle he is not a bum
lfg cash
Walmart Julian Newman going crazy tho no cap
Where’s Clown Wise when you need him?
This for the culture Cash you better not lose.
When you max out your Ball Handle and go play stage in 2k....
Damn cash a dub is a dub but you should have cooked this kid make him not wanna hoop no more. U gotta violate
Yo cash, you rolled with crips back in the day. Take that red off cuh
8:13 CLAMPS!!!!
Cash a big blood today 😂
Kenny needs to stfu
You can tell kenny was lowkey hatin. He only talked when Wise makes a shot but quiet when cash makes one 😂😂
He do a bunch of nothing lol
And this guy thinks he gonna go to the league
“I Actually Did That Move Back In 7th Grade I Just Didn’t Have The Cameras On” -Flight😂
if you play basketball seriously u can do those dribble moves easily
He must go through a lot of shoes
Dribbles in one place.. then shoots. 🥱😐
🔥🐐🐐🐐
He does all that just to miss🤣
Imagine doing all that dribbling just to lose
He's a good dribbler but he doesn't go anywhere, if you look at the best ball handlers they know how to get to places without using all those unecassary dribble moves, if he learns to restrain himself and only use what needs to be used and use his skill to his advantage he has potential to be good, but right now all I see is another Julian newman
Cash had to man handle him 🤣
This kid literally like if you watched Flight with 1.75x speed lmaooooooo
WET LIKE WATTAAAAAAAAA
Lol
Gio is nice only if he moved when he is dribbling and I rather be fast then stong
The dbg music
Way too much dribbling  🤣🤣🤣
Why cash left hand layups better than his right 😭
Nah cash I’m proud you did good 8/10 nice clutch defence and shot to end it
His biggest flaw is he can't defend
all that dribling and he cant even finish it lmfao
Cash never miss game winners top of the key wet like water 💯
That guy is the biggest flop. What a weirdo
Cash must’ve been playin wit his food to let Gio wise score at least 10 points
That was a crazy game, but hey Cash is on a winning streak.
Yessir
He dribbles more in one Possession than curry and klay Combined!
His jumper makes me hate him and the dribbling of course 😂😂
Can't wait for flight's reaction
Cashnasty vs kenny 2.0 this about to be interesting 🧐
All that dribbling for nothing
Cash 1v1 vs Duke ?👀
3:37 woah woah
Lol I beat him
Anyone else notice the only shots the kid made was win cash stopped playing d???🤔🤔🤔
I can tell this video is edited 🥳
If a 2k16 playmaker  escaped the game😂
Gio plays like those idiots on 2K who spam curry slides and shoot threes 😂
Bruh, this dude play exactly like a 2k neighborhood player just sit behind the 3 pt line spam dribbling going nowhere and chucking up 3's. On top of that no defense 🤦 😂😂😂
cash how are you going to let him Scored 10 Points on you🤦🏼‍♂️
9:20 u might wanna check those wires
How he 1 v 1 Cash b4 he 1v1’d Cam 😂
all the moving and dribbling is useless he should atleast try and break his ankles
Lol just finished warching u react to him
That clown over dribbles
Bruh the guy can not dribble he just dose between the lags in one spot kinda fast
After Cash blocked the shot, he could’ve jus lay the ball up. Not check it
You know cash is paying dem bills when it say “ includes paid promotions”
He not good just stomping his feet
Wet like wattaaaaa!!!!!!!! 🌊
Old cash the make the hype beast mad was better

Close Game 12-10 cash wins
When you upgrade one skill all the way
8:13 and 10:36 That HOF defense 😤💪
One of your best games honestly
Cash I doubt you have seen my negative comments towards you and you could probably care less but I just want to apologize bro. Who am I to judge you..? Trying to live a positive lifestyle now. Both mentally and physically. Keep up the good work and be safe man. Peace ✌
Can he be good if he went somewhere or do track or something
1v1 denobeballin
Happy feet dribbler lol only if he had hesi in his arsenal
Damn gave you 10 points CASH is a Hoop
1/6 from his “hot spot” the top of the key
his dribble would be alot faster if he didn't move his feet like that
Wtf is that spark in 9:20???
This is the guy that wants to play Cam Wilder😂 Pathetic
When game is on the line I’m taking cash from top of the key> curry
Cash the Goat
I have cash winning 12 10 or 12 8
30 seconds of dribbling for a brick is hilarioussss
If he cant beat you he cant beat a young 6'5 college Hooper lol he sucks

Does this dude ever change??? 😂
If you would have lost I would have been mad

Gio wise sucks
Cash good game 🔥🔥🔥 , but you gotta get that cardio right ASAP
Cash the game would be a lot easier just gotta work on your shot and get your stamina up nive vid tho💯🔥🔥
Anyone else notice that spark effect at 9:21 👀
all he's doing is spamming dribbles in one spot, cash should be able to press him easily.
Yo cash, I’ve been trying to find a perfect Father’s Day gift for my dad and when you showed the displate posters, I knew it was perfect. Thanks 🙏
YOOOOOOOO  ~Cashnasty

"Most hated tik toker" 😭😂
I’ll beat Gio he has no defense tbh
Toppa the Key Baaaaaby
WET LIKE WATTTTTTTTAAAAAA
How old is gio
This is hard to watch, my man just dribbling to create no space
Gg doe
All those dribbling just to brick a shot
This vid was made 3 weeks ago
If cash lost im not paying bills anymore i just become homeless or sum wish me luck
I can beat Gio in a 1v1 easily he sucks
Josh Ursery still has to play him 🤤
You go for 10-1
Yeee
Stop playing wit cash he dropping alot of ppl off
No hate towards this kid but everyone making him look better then what he is 😂
Cash your not a shooter
Cash i’m disappointed you only won 12-10
If cash gets dropped off I ain’t helping with them bills no more
Imagine watching this kid vs Julian Newman
Violated him in the title😭
Should’ve posted this unedited.
POV : We’re waiting for flight to react to this 😭
Displate is garbage. They fall all the time and since it's metal it dents the floor.
What in the 2k
He ain’t even that impressive 💀
Can’t wait to see the flight reacts to cash reacting to flight reacting to cash’s 1v1
all that dribbling aint going no damn where
He did to much 😂 “ cash wet like water fr fr”
Yo Cash Grinds
Cash you let him score 10 really bruh💀💀
Im predicting cash to win 12-5
This guys play style reminds me of Julian Newman
He doing to much and not going anywhere not met to hate
Strong
Gio is a terrible basketball player lmaoooo
1v1 VS Kenny Chao’s little better cousin
cash won
Cam is skunking still
if only he can just go too the paint he can be consistent but he good
Imagine Cash losing to Gio
Does the king reply
You better not lose
We see you cash good shit
If can’t wait to see flight reaction to this if he loses😂
Worst than Julian Newman
As long as his top of the key shot is falling and Cash does his usual HOF clamps, this game a wrap
Broke Julian Newman vs Cash
He’s dribbling in place...
5:00 hopper hopper move by cash
He’s overrated gio chasing clout
gio is a bum
He is literally a park player in real life
He doesn't dribble fast all he dose is pick his feet up
Tell him to come to the streets...
Tell gio to stop dodging cam wilder 😳
5:10 cash wtf 😂
Cash can literally back him down in the paint every play and 12-0 him.
Cash bout to embarrass this dude 😈
LFFFGGG CASH
Bro why can make clips on youtube now⁉️😂
T up Cash
finally been waiting on this for months
Dribbling out energy use that speed to blow pass ppl
*if you’re reading this I wish nothing but wealth and health all 2021*
He doing all that dribbling for no reason
Terrible handles by Gio. Literally 3rd graders have better handles than him.
GOAAAATTT
Ain’t no way cash let Gio score 10 on him 😭💀💀💀
Bruh I can NOT believe this man ( gio ) got famous from doing nothing 🤦🏾‍♂️ anybody can dribble around like a crackhead 🤦🏾‍♂️
Cash plays zero perimeter defense 😂😂
Holy fuck he’s playing Julian Newman 2.0
Yes sir 🔥🔥🔥
WHY TF IS HE MOST HATED LMAO
From the beginning of basketball to 2018  strong now... fast ... strong is negative now lol 😂
