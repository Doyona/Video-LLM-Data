The same angle as today game vs wotford but SANCHEZ head it in
Was good while it lasted
Two games in, an Kane has been just a bit unlucky
I saw a Watford kit and I said to him 1-0 TOTTNHAM 🤣🤣🤣 (btw im a spurs fan)
COYS
mora looking solid
spurs can win this season if they keep it up
Ben Foster in!
Did anyone one see sissoko push dier
Well done son
1:37 what the crack with Dele Ali 😞 wish he would find some form
Oh no what is the keeper doing 😂
spurs are off to a brilliant start in the premier league
Kane definitely not World class that’s for sure!
I AM IN THIS WHEN DELE GOES INTO THE SOUTH STAND NEARLY LOL IN THE GREY HOODIE WITH GREEN WRITING
Happy for Reguilon as well. He fit very well in the team .
No one should ever compare CR7 to son. One man scores free kicks, headers, left foot, right foot on a weekly basis- in the biggest games while the other scores in some prem games and goes missing in big games.
Great win for waterfront
ARSENAL ARE BOTTOM TOTTENHAM ARE TOP TOTTENHAM ARE TOP ARSENAL ARE BOTTOM TOTTENHAM ARE TOP  FOR 2 weeks of the international break  Won’t last long so enjoy while we can spurs fans 😂😂😂
People saying don't get carried away spurs fans ect , it's early ect. What needs to be realised us we have still win 3 in a row , against nan city and including an away win and conceded no goals! I think that should be proof the spurs this year with be stronger and are better disciplined and savvy and more confidence.
0:59 Goalkeeper should of done better there should never gone in
Tottenham think they already win the premier league wait until they bottle it 🤣
I’m West Ham fan and even I Love Son. The perfect player. Attitude wise and effort wise. The skill comes as the bonus!
We are wining the league this year 🔥
What is that on alli,s head????? Guy looks like a brush
What was the goalie doing on that freekick lol he could of stopped it easily.
Tottenham are on a good run
I remember Spurs Legend John Pratt scoring a identical goal to Sonny's goal against Watford today wayyyy back in March 1972 during a 6th round FA Cup game against a Mighty Leeds United at Elland Road. Unfortunately our beloved Spurs lost that game 2-1, but both John's and Sonny's were almost identical. 'Audere Est Facere'
Spurs gonna win the prem
nuno is class
Son is brilliant man. I'm a spurs fan and I cant believe we're on top of the league. All thanks to son 😊
Don’t wanna see Big Ben foster concede
Noice
I’m glad no one else scored so that son got his moment ❤️
Penalty at 40 seconds. should be disciplined.
Injured cycling Gk > fraudmann
Gosh man Spurs stadium is really loud.
fluke
and this is why the cycling GK needs to be in goal.
wheres ben foster watford
From a Liverpool fan that was an amazing free kick
harry kane said he felt a slight touch on the free kick so he's claimed it
Dier and Sanchez look like totally different players from last season, fantastic turn around, then again its only been 3 games
Son is highly underrated and one of the best
Kane is useless
Son is world class
The reason the goal went in is because Bachmann was waiting for one of the spurs players to get a touch before reacting. It's not great goalkeeping but it's not a major error either, just a deceptively good ball from Son
🤣🤣🤣
I think a giant poster should be put up just of Son's smile and happy face He seems to bring out the best in his team as well And when Harry Kane isn't in the starting line up or is injured Son plays with a confidence and a style that seems so natural its great to watch and I'm a Forest supporter so I tend to watch other players just to cheer myself up and remind myself that once upon a time my team were good to watch and won trophies aaahh memories lol 🥅⚽👍🏆☯️🆗🆒
Son made it look easy.
Tottenham showing Arsenal how to maintain your "Big Six" tag
Eric Dier paid me to say this Dier man of the match
How’s no big team put a bid in for son yet what a player needs to win things!!!
Wheres Ben Foster?
Tottenham perfect start under New Manager NUn,,with their arch rival rooted at the bottom.
Lol haven't played anyone decent pipe down Tottenham fans 🤣🤡
Son is the only good player in Tottenham sometimes
Goalkeeper had lag.
0:29 ''Off the line by eric dier'' ???
Ben foster would have saved it
Spurs won the danny rose and sissoko rivalry
I think that goal was more on the keeper having a shocker
Here's son proving why kane isn't needed
That was brilliant
Keep it up lads
"Off the line by Eric Dier"  Was 5 yards out 😂
This just shows that asians will always be underated and undervalued !! Sons the best player on this team and hes world class
Son is so underated
Bruh son needs to leave man pls he’s wasted there he needs to go to Barca or other premier league team cuz Tottenham are so bad for him
wtf is the keeper doing we need ben foster
Good strike but goalkeeper error imo.  Never the less, Son is a fantastic footballer
Post the PSG game
(Every article online about traore to Spurs)- “levy willing to pay 40 million when wolves want 45” (Actual Levy in meeting with wolves board) “I will give u a pound a month, every month for the rest of your life....)
Since Nuno wasn't spurs first choice who was? Cause he's doing fine so far
Good start to the season for Spurs but much like last season, once they face the other big boys (yes, they beat Man City in GW1), they will slide into the 5th/6th place area once the season settles down.
Sissoko blatantly fouling Dier in the box but no doubt some people will just say it was “strength”…
Backman 😂😂 Ben foster next gamer
Wheres ben at
commentator nailed his prediction for Sons freekick..
Tottenham top of PL. Meanwhile Arsenal... bottom of the PL and the 6th best team in London. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
With Tottenham at the top and Arsenal at the bottom has the premier league become a London CLUB sandwich?
Can believe Kane missed a sitter
Ben would of saved that
Should have started Cycling GK
Son 1-0  0:59
WE ARE TOP OF THE LEAGUE SAY WE ARE TOP OF THE LEAGUE! With no goals conceded this season and Arsenal are bottom of the league with no goals scored this season. A great start to the season.
Nothing better than Spurs top Arsenal bottom.
Son is the definition of a serial statpadded.goes missing in big games too much
That’s why you should start the cycling gk
The corridor of uncertainty
The Son goal is just like the KDB goal against PSG.
Incredible goal by son... Harry can leave if he wants too 🤣
Surprise surprise Kane not needed again
Some people are so clueless about football it's embarrassing. I've seen many keepers concede goals like that where keepers expect a touch and when there isn't it's too late to react. IT HAPPENS.
Spurs don't need Kane to be honest
Ben foster saves that and we all know it
YID ARMY!
Please Spurs won. Lacklustre performance. A hard watch. Hate to say it though. If Nuno does not  change that midfield the good results won't last. Skipp is not a premiership player. Far to slow, ponderous, no presence in midfield. Ali slows everything down. We need  more invention in midfield. Gil, or even Lo Celso are a better option.
Lol, Foster wouldn't have let that in
Time to screenshot the top of the table for posterity.... COYS.
I don't think Son was trying to cross it. That ball was so direct, it looked like it was an actual attempt at goal.
That is disgraceful goalkeeeping
3 games 3 wins by 1 zero hehe that's a lot considering the quality of the Tottenham players , this is all the managers worth
Lol and everyone has their eyes on Kane…  Son was the real deal from the start and I’m surprised that no big club offered him a contract
2 things I’ve learned from this game son is very underrated and spurs looks so solid this year defensively
Spurs were top at christmas last season, calm down they will always bottle eventually
Pro club keeping for the free kick
I’m starting to think they’re gonna go the whole season 1-0
We should've sold Kane and Bought Bramford or Tammy!
rip cycling gk
I dunno, maybe we should let son take our free kicks instead of our fridge of a centre back
Tottenham look so much more lively this season. Is it just me or does it feel like some pressure lift of tottes shoulders. They look more consistent during the game which for me looks like a contender for top4
Yes,get in
what was that goalkeeping on the free kick
Fair Play
Spurs top of the league, Arsenal bottom of the league. Order restored.
Honestly, Spurs fans are OTT with criticism of the Gunners. Focus on winning more and possibly doing the unthinkable.
How has sons goal gone in tho, I'm a big son fan I think he's incredible but how has the keeper let that in of all things
why wont the cycling gk ever start
Arsenal bottom Spurs top with three 1-0 wins. Have I woken up in an alternate universe?
Son just did a de bruyne shot
Fozzy is saving that
Watford keeper definitely had a bet that Son would be 1st goal scorer .
Glen Hoddle called it 👏
Is It Nuno?  Rate him as a top manager.  Looks like he is making the difference.
The cycling gk would’ve saved it
Sissoko was out for revenge today  hahahahahha😂😂
The two London club's at either side of the premiership Table 😶
I don't get it??
That goal would’ve had Ben Foster smashing his GoPro.
Where’s Ben foster with go pro
Son is elite world-class, top 25 in the world. Don't be mistaken.
How has that gone in? 🤣🤣
Spurs for the tittle?
Son is such a baller
They need to put Foster back in goal
Get in there my SON !
Keeper should of saved it quality player though.
i was in the away end and we acc played v good. first half could of had 2-3 shame after the first goal heads dropped
I’m proud of you son
Should’ve had put on Ben foster
No one going to comment on how the commentator called it?
Ben foster would’ve saved that. Should be starting if he wasn’t injured. Cycling gk 💪💪💪
Get Ben foster in
thats a crap goal
Thank you Spurs I was in last man standing and won because off them
Sanchez: Reborn
Kane must been so gutted that he hasn't got his move to City.
Who doesn’t love abit of sonny 👌
Eric dier didn’t clear it off the line, his fat head was in the way
As an arsenal fan I hate and love son at the same time, I guess it might of been the same thing for spurs fans for Alexis Sanchez.
when mahrez done that against psg it was considered lucky lmao
Failford going to go straight back down. Did nothing significant over the summer to get ready for the premiership.
Proud of em🤍🤍
Arsenal fans will need counselling
We are going to struggle to score goals in all our away games. None of our strikers will hit double figures and all teams need to do is to stop (foul) Sarr and you stop us from scoring. Too predictable. All these midfielders but such a weak strike force. Need to stop playing a centre back (Cathcart) at right back as well.
Cycling gk would never.
Omg 3   1-0. Games from Spurs they are so boring
I'm a fan of Tottenham, and I am glad Nuno Espirito Santo has got are team winning a load of games (3) and we won against Manchester city who have won 5-0 twice. So happy we are playing well, Rohan  Have a good evening everyone.
Spurs r top of the table won 3/3 games   And then we have Arsenal… -not scored once -lost 3/3 games  -20TH in the league  😂😂😂😂
Watford need foster in goals
Such poor goalkeeping
Off the line with Eric dyer.. Specksavers a think
Son is worth more than the whole arsenal squad, superb player👌👌👌🐓🐓
Kane can't score simple goals for England or Tottenham it seems.
Spurs seem pretty fresh this sesson, maybe the clubs getting what they need now.
Cycling gk would of saved that no problem
Can't understand why Utd Chelsea city Liverpool never gone in to sign son
Goalkeeping error. There are free kicks where questions are asked whether someone will make contact, but this wasn't really one of them. The ball was too close to the keeper and there was little chance of a touch so the keeper should have been making a routine save.
What a save!
Why'd that guy run up to Son like he was starting on him at a club.   (Don't know his name sorry Spurs fans)
Spurs no losses but keep getting 1:0
My Son scored
PLAY BEN FOSTER
You can say what you want about spurs but we didn't let a goal in through the pandemic and we haven't let a goal in this season lol
Good
Son is an inspirational human being. That goal was very clever.
How has that Son goal gone in?!!
I'd like to see more goals from this Spurs team but a great start for them
Its all Downhill from here for Spurs……..
Worldclass!! Sonny!!
0:27 Off the line? smh commentaters are blind these days.
Nuno's new tactics be like: *ultra attack for 10 mins* after goal: *p a r k t h e b u s*
Some great saves from Bachmann, without him Watford would have lost 4:0
Bachmann had sonny triple captained this week
Good start for the spurs but will end up 7th
If Son was Brazilian or French he'd be more hyped up. What a player
Lucas is flying nowadays
The first time Tottenham beat Watford since 18/19
Bryan Gil - New Donny Van de Beek of Spurs.
Nuno has the balance of results and work in progress right atm 👏
Interesting to see if spurs keep this up kane wanted to go cause spurs where carrying so much dead weight now that they got a scare it looks promising
The Watford goalkeeper be like              “iT ŵAś LâG”
Son is alegend of as a United fan
Baumann looked shaky
Arsenal fans setting the Premier League table alphabetically
It's definitely not exciting football but you can't deny it's efficient
Yes the reason Kane isnt taking the free kick is because its the one thing he's absolutely useless at!
When the script kicks in, in the 90th min on fifa.
As a itd fan son is overrated he needs to leave spurs to win trophies
Always said it An I'm gonna say it again 😁😁  I think Heung-min Son is absolutely brilliant... He's got it all. I bet it's terrifying for a defender when he's running at ya with that pace and skill 😁😁
nice free kick from super sonny c.o.y.s.
Dier block was class.
Arsenal in the mud
The cycling gk is saving that
I'm happy for the win but it won't last, we have no creativity. This was a lucky win
Went to the game as a non biased west ham fan and eric dier is ridiculous slept on solid at the back
Cycling Gk saving that all day of the week
1:08 They about to kiss?
Is it late to become a pro footballer at 28 or 29 years old if you have the talent and style ?
Is it late to become a pro footballer at 28 or 29 years old if you have the talent and style ?
Bachmann must have Son in his FPL team.
When are Watford gonna start playing benny boy 🤦‍♂️🚴🏼‍♂️💨
Chelsea, Man City, Man Utd, Liverpool and now Spurs. This season is going to be very intense.
Tottenham 1-0 man city,Wolverhampton 0-1 Tottenham,Tottenham 1-0 watford who's next🤣
1 nil fc
1ST: Tottenham   20TH: Arsenal
Forget Harry Kane, I want son in my team
Keepers had a shocker there... Watches it all the way then dives once it's already past him
Keepers reaction time 🕛🕐🕒🕕🕔🕕
0:28 I'm pretty sure it's not off the line by Eric Dier lol
Doesn't matter how many times I watch it, I still don't understand how the Watford keeper lets that in. Still, we'll take it. We're not setting the world alight, not very pretty to watch and somehow I don't think we'll still be top at the end of the season, but three out of three, you can't ask for more.
Thing just not going Kanes way at the mo
How did the keeper not see that?!😱🤣🤷🏻‍♂️💁🏿‍♀️🤦🏻‍♂️
0:40 lmao sissoko pushing dier like that makes you almost forget sissoko was a Spurs player 1 day ago
Spurs are as good as the trophies they have won
Where’s the cycling gk when you need him
Imagine if Spurs won the league. Imagine. I would have to stop watching football.
Can't count spurs out for title race imo. If alli comes back into form for them then thats a ruthless attack
Let's start giving Eric Dier a bit of credit for his performances.
Keeper has to come for that. Shocking
Proud mama right now
Yes, we maybe 20th but Tottenham haven't won the Premier league in over 40 years. Banter Team with no Trophies
Winning, early days and not playing as well they could be... great signs
Looks to me like he’s been watching a lot of James Tavernier🇬🇧🇬🇧
I’m not a Spurs fan but when son scores it’s always intense 👏
Bottleham started good last season and fell off same will happen again they are abit better than Arsenal they will get Thursday night footy again
Spurs, 3 cleansheet 3 matches 9 points. Arsenal 3 matches no cleansheets no goals scored
Hehe boi
Spurs will win the league this year
Son is just carrying spurs
Delighted Sissoko is finally gone. Did anyone see him tracking Alli for the run into the box when he missed? Comedy gold he is.
Andy townsend is a legend.
Spurs look absolutely world class
When did watford sign cal the dragon?
Were arsenal playing this weekend?
Its like the keeper let that goal in on purpose 🤔 Corruption in football i think.
Who's the duck egg in goal for Watford
1:10 doge coin on the shoulder
Foz would've saved that.
Nice one, Sonny🇰🇷
Tottenham trophy - "Last PL team with 100 percent record"
Coys! Top of the league but not reading too much into that but enjoying the start we've made
If Spurs can secure the signing of Adama And Houssem and the Barca RB Emerson and reintegrate Ndombele in the 11, Top 4 Shouldn't be a problem
nice one sonny
That free kick was class, you can't deny that 👏
1-0 Tottenham every prem game soo far anyone else realize
Been a Spurs fan all me life. I'm 64 now. I've learned the hard way, not to start chicken counting 🤦🏼
It’s Watford’s fault for not playing Ben in net
Like what sir Alex Ferguson said    "Attack wins you games , defence wins you titles"
Keeper clearly on spurs payroll.
Nope, didn't get that one either.
A freekick and a half
Son to the rescue again.
Son sonny son
Tottenham won all the games by 1-0
0:38 - Sissoko just manhandling Dier like that man. Bet he's glad he only sees him twice a season now instead of every single day.
It was a freak goal that saw the spuds win other than that they were crap , just lucky
Spurs have yet to concede a goal and Arsenal have yet to score a goal...
Bachmann is still a better keeper than Foster, a lot more consistent and this is the first mistake in ages. Sorry to all you Cycling GK fan boys but Foster won't be starting.
I know spurs won’t stay perfect all season but can’t deny it’s a good start from nuno he’s got my trust in him
Son is and has been better than Kane for a couple years now. Tottenham can lose Kane and they won’t notice a precipitous drop off, none if they manage to invest wisely
Perfect start or not, they aren’t going to get near a champions league place
Cycling GK would've saved that
He didn't even mean to score that, lucky to of scored that but if he actually did mean it then would've been a good goal
Come on you spurs
If kane can get back on form and score Tottenham could be scary
How's that gone in from son 😂😂 absolutely shocking goal 🤦‍♂️😂 coys!
Bachman ahhhhhhh
Spurs can be first all the way til 5 games left - they still won't finish first, I just don't believe it, don't really know why, just feels temporary
Is it just me or are Spurs in love with 1-0 wins
"corridor of uncertainty" 👏
Bruh the commentator called it
Son what a goal 👏
With the Cycling GK in goal that's never going in
“Off the line by Eric Dier” 🤔
Arsenal bottom and Spurs top. Wow
Tottenham 1st  Arsenal 20th  😂😂😂😂😂😂
What a gaol  Keep going Higgins son
Spurs just need that finishing touch. So much good football being played
Sissoko will turn watford into a completely new team this season.
Wtf was the keeper doing 🤷🏻‍♀️
Son is super underrated i would put him on the level of mane and salah, the guy is great, right foot left foot free kicks corners finishing hes got it all even dribbling like his wonder goal against Burnley. I think if he was at a bigger club he would be rated more. Arsenal fan btw
Gk is not premier League level.
They play boring football but wins are wins
Bachmann is real class.
Sanchez had a great performance today, starting to find his form again
Cycling GK would have never let that in 😤
Spurs always win by one goal
Spurs could suprise a few people this year, they havent made any significant changes to their squad but they certainly have potential
Nuno seems to have got tottenham defenders actually keeping clean sheets madness
When the f*** did sissoko join Watford? 😲😲😲
Son pretty much carries Tottenham rn
Spurs will inevitably bottle it . That's all they are: bottlers
Sonny is truly a great player
Spurs top of the league 3 cleansheets from 3 with Dier & Sanchez at CB. Can't knock that start from Nuno.
First
Not gonna lie i think Kane might just be the curse because Tottenham seem to be doing fine without him really doing anything 🤔
For the first time ever in premier league history  Spurs are top of the table whilst arsenal are bottom
Cycling GK in the team after that Bachmann howler???
COYS
That was quick ngl
COYS!!
Can’t wait to see spurs bottle this title charge
son is such a good player
