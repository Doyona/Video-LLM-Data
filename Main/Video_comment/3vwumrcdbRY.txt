this movie was soo goood. i did not know they released it after a year of dropping this one. loved it the first time i watched it before.
What movie is this??
From one point of view this could be an unofficial Kennedy Star Wars movie keeping Star Wars out of the title to try to boost the ratings
Rember Zach no great movie should ELEVATE your sense of SELF above the project or beneath it.     The only thing that SHOULD be beneath you IS YOUR BIG EGO.  I like all of your other movies.  Soooo good that is why this makes no sense.   This movie is like a  bunch of bad inflated TV commercials pasted together with no real direction.
What a disaster!  Chaotic and Confusing!  The plot is ridiculous, tired, and weak.  AS great as Zach Synder's projects have been this one is absolutely a letdown in my opinion. Zach uses costumes and special effects to try visually to give the movie a jolt to hype up a plot that has been used and overused so much that it is so predictable.    No wonder George rejected this story.   Rebel Moon is a LOW-LOW B VERSION OF STAR WARS.  Rember Zach no great movie should elevate your sense of self above the project or beneath the movie project.  The only thing that SHOULD be beneath you IS YOUR BIG EGO.   REBEL MOON is awful.  This is your inflated ego.  Settle down and just be Zach Synder and let us rave and praise you; Rebel Moon is  YOU TRYING TO BE ENTITLED.  Your movies have been amazing, wonderful, and just great entertainment.  Because it is Zach Synder doesn't mean we are gonna love trash.  Rebel Moon is Trash.
REBEL DISASTER  NOT REBEL MOON
I really dont understand the hate this movie is getting, and I'm not even a ZS fan, I hated what he did with Man of Steel, but that's beside the point. Ok, so this was just 7 Samurai in space, so what?  It was a good Saturday afternoon movie, and I didn't have to pay 20 bucks for a theater ticket. Yes, it wasn't great and had some flaws, but it was still better than anything Lucas Films has put out in the last decade, and again, i didn't have to pay 20 bucks to see it. Im looking forward to the directors cut to see how it fleshes out, and again, i won't have to pay 20 bucks to see it either. I know in most cases, reviewers only get views when they trash something, but seriously, it wasn't that bad, and if you thought it was, maybe your expectations were too high.
WOW, WHAT AN AWESOME SCI-FI MOVIE !!!  Kathleen Kennedy has made another disastrous decision to reject one of the greatest stories in SCI-FI.   This film is up there with the greatest Star Wars films.   KATHERINE KENNEDY RESIGN IMMEDIATELY  !!!
i really liked it. will rewatch. maybe all these haters are bought and paid for.
wyt man bad.
Woow, this was a really great movie from the start to the end. ❤️👍
Epic movie for sure
I am so sick of the “strong female lead”. The idea has jumped the shark a long time ago.
i want see this movie
I love the snippets of not-so-subtle star wars throw-backs. Passive agressively telling Kathleen Kennedy, "See what could have been Ma'am?"
looks good
I’ve decided that all I care about is Rebel Moon for now. Might watch some other stuff here and there but this is basically it. It’s cool.
Cant wait to see this. I love that its basically a repurposed Star Wars script that he pitched to Lucasfilm. Lets see if he can rival it
This gave me Star Wars, Dune and John Carter at the same time
🔥🔥
Trailer music?
Looks like a expensive flop imo ,
Looks four hours long to hit all those plot points and side stories.
Zack Snyder's Dune!
I kind of feel bad for zack, because his fan base just makes it really it easy for the internet to hate on his brand and his movies…but despite his flaws and pretentious tendencies, he’s a real artist. He’s not just trying to churn out successful blockbusters, he’s a filmmaker with vision, who’s always trying to say something (with varying levels of execution). To me, this looks artistic as all get out, and I’m extremely excited to check it out (hopefully in theaters)
What’s the soundtrack?!
that looks promising, please don't fail us
Does George Lucas know that Zack’s made a Star Wars film?
looks very epic, the only downfall for me at least only for the trailer, lack of signature OST theme, the music from the trailer sounds very generic
Can't believe this is not adapted from a game God damnnnn. Hopefully warhammer 40 k will beat this hands down
Не впечатлило
I am getting Jupiter ascending vibes and I hope I am wrong
Zack really is the GOAT.  This looks amazing.
Zack Snyder making another mediocre movie lol. In all seriousness, I respect him trying to do his own thing, but I wish he would focus more on substance rather than style
i just ''watched'' the entire movie in the trailer...SMH
Me: Mom can we watch Dune part 2?  Mom: No we got Dune part 2 at home!  Dune part 2 at home:
Nope.  Zach Snyder can't write worth a damn.   This will be an incoherent mess that looks good, just like all of his movies.
Dune 2.0
They need a theater release!
I dunno but CGI looks little low quality.
300 in space
Not woke enough. Do better. Be better.
"Scargiver". Wow thats cringey. And did a 120 pound girl just knock down a 300+ pound man? Those are some really accomodating stunt men.
Wow.
Woah this is amazing
Looks amazing!
Seven Samurai in Space.
No clue what’s going on and that excites me to oblivion and it all just looks so epic. The hype is as massive as when I was a child hearing about the new Star Wars movies coming out
Must watch
How to train your dragon sequel?
Garbage production.... damn Netflix has the cheapest shittest production
The most derivitive thing I've ever seen. Looks like a low budget disney plus show.
It's sci Fi so it will flop with 6/10. Means I will love it 😂
Boring, epic music and slow motion, Zack Snyder never changes
“Strong female protagonist” in 2023 = hard pass
I hope this does well so Disney can see what they missed out on with this not being Star Wars
1:30 Thats some Dark Souls crap right there
3:20 Do you guys thi nk Zack Snyder is involved in this movie? They didn't quite make it clear.
How is this not DUNE?
Mid
this looks so cheap
MedMen Stock Moving up now! Marijuana the future for the World. Buy Mmnff stock today!...
A King is a Man and a Man can Fail... But a Myth is INDESTRUCTIBLE
Dune 3
Looks more like a Dune type movie more than a Starwars movie
When you got Anthony Hopkins narrating, Dijmon as one of the main characters, along with a host of good actors, topped with an epic story, visually stunning, artistry beyond what has been produced by others, and rejected by Disney, this movie is going to be the epic.
This looks so damn good
Disney is going to regret not letting Zack make this in the Star Wars Universe
Alright then, you have my attention.
Great. Another woke girl-boss movie. Yay.
Isa = Jesus
So many movies jumbled into one...
Is this Zack Snyder's version of Dune?....
🤡
This is the most Zack Snyder thing I’ve ever seen.
OK, Mr. Snyder made his own Star Wars movie, and it looks way more Star Warsy than anything Lucasfilm made recently. How should I take this ? Anyway, that looks very promising.
Looks cringey and cheap,looks like Zack is  out of money. just leave sci-fi movie making to Denis Villeneuve
Awesome Awesome yeeees Snyder is back 🥵🥵🥵
will it fall under NEW Oscar requirements :)? and if so .... how lfast the fall will be ?
Wow..just wow..am not even a space sify person but this got me so wanna watch..a very well done trailer Zack..
I lost count on how many movies it rips off shamelessly but oh well...
اثق ب مجهود سنايدر في أفلامه، أرى طابع إخراجي مكرر لكنه جديد بطريقة غير مفهومة ، انتظر الفلم ب فارغ الصبر و اعتقد ان الأحداث ستكون ملحمية
JAX TELLER
Gladiator: Part 3 Space edition
Ive been saying since KK and disney has roally fvcked up Star Wars maybe someone needs to make a new Franchise thats just different enlugh from SW to not get sued but close enough we can all enjoy and get our SW fix. Maybe this is it or at least on that road.   The time of the lame girl boss os over. We dont need strong female characters we just need well written characters who evolve within the story. Dont tell us show us.
The moon isn’t red it’s more of a grey ish color
Seriously don't know what other people are seeing in this
Nice to see the female lead doesn't have a sense of arrogance about her, like all of Disney's latest projects. Looks good.
Seem to be running the same trope, white man bad anyone else good, when will this nonsesnse end.
Wow that looks like absolute trash 🗑
Honestly I loved BVS, Watchmen, 300 but the "look" of his movies is getting old. The whole CGI background constantly is really tiring. When its not there though it just looks like a disney movie and has a very TV look. Plus the whole "girl is the key to everthing" nowadays..... Not to mention that absolutely horrendous zombie movie he last made. I'm hoping its good but I really dont see anything special, very been here seen that.
Well, it _is_ something new, as in it's not yet another superhero thing and not based on an existing IP. So there's that. Too bad it's _Zack Snyder's_ new thing, which means this is going to be some John Carter of Mars level nonsense. Oh, it'll look impressive and be chock-full of ideas and visuals... and none of it will be interesting in the slightest.
Damn i was really looking forward to watching this…! …until I saw the Arachne wtf
No theatrical release - Netflix loses more and more of my respect with each passing day!
FYI R.T. I disliked the channel not the content
Thank you lord that Disney is out of this one!
I'd love to see a movie where the bad guy's not a white male for a change.
The score...SHEEEEEEESH!
This is like the star wars for adults that I've always wished for
2:22 siuuu~ ?
I can understand why Snyder got haters. He's a visionary way before his time! His style is unique and shine so much that it blinds the average viewers making them unable to see what they are presented. No wonder why his movies are truly appreciated years after their release, movie goers need time to adjust their eyes.
Picture and characters ❤️‍🔥
This is going to be a masterpiece
*Haven’t seen a movie with Sofia in it in a while. Glad to see her back.*
meh.
EP-IC
John Carter meets Serenity Vibes
Wow!! I'm watching this!! :D
knockoff starwars lightsaber
This King is bringing all the fantasies together🤯
Looks epic!
rogue one ripoff
Ah the bug of lens flare has migrated and found a new host from JJ Abrams to Zack Snyder.
Zach Snyder: that's all I need to know.  He makes awesome trailers, but movies are trash.
AvatarXStar WarsX DuneX💩💩💩. Looks horrible.
Looks great for NF.  WB are just 🤦‍♂️ for not letting Snyder finish his EPIC Superhero arc. 👎🏽
Lol, movies still casting Ed Skrein
Pass
I'm just gonna loop the trailer and pretend I'm watching a movie! Looks super exciting!
IN ZACK WE TRUST.....
I feel like I’m going to like this as much as I did Dune. Getting similar vibes.
This needs a 6 hrs run time
"Which trope would you like to use" "ALL OF THEM!!"  It looks like a mess.
Looks promising
Talk about over the top dialogue. This movie looks goofy. The Trailer is one Cliche after the other. Seems like the writing is extremely unbalanced. We will see when the movie comes out. I will go see just to see if Hollywood has completely lost its ability to write a good movie. Throwing a bunch of extreme hero cliches into a movie to try and make it appear epic does not make for a good movie. In fact, it does not even make for a good trailer. I hope the movie is not as bad as this trailer. Its laughable. Even this movie's title is goofy. "Rebel Moon". Say that in an announcers voice. Reminds me of a cheap 1980s space flick. Oh gee, the inhabitants of a moon are rebelling against the evil overlords on the main planet-genius. Whatever.
The soldiers fight, then find out their mothers' names are all Martha. Peace follows.
Looks awesome. Way better than Dune 2 trailer.
Charlie hunnam should be the next bond
Actually looks awesome and glad to see original sci-fi fantasy movies being made
I cant wait for this to flop, then Snyder try to save face by releasing a 20 hour director's cut which supposedly makes the movie better (but actually doesnt).
"directed by zack snoozer" ohhh NO THANKS LMAO
Good thing Netflix is treating Zack Snyder greatly, unlike the folks at WB who just threw him under the bus at every turn.  Sure, Zack's work is divisive, but there's no denying his ambition at what he does, no matter the end result.
Mom can we have dune?  No we have dune at home  the dune at home: this movie
This looks awesome, hopefully it's good.
My nipples are so hard right now.
What Disney SW should’ve been
I see dgimoo I will watch
Honestly, this is what  Disney should have done with Star Wars.
2:57 easy, I don't believe in anything no more
Apparently this should have been a star wars movie/series. But kathleen kennedy didn't like it
Girl boss ✅
REBEL MOON is finally coming out!  hail to the creators!
Star wars missed out turning this down
Filmed in glorious SnyderVision. ❤
Disney should have asked Snyder to direct the Eternals.
In the words of Chaka Luther King "I think George Lucas gonna sue somebody"!
This looks insane!! ❤ I love Z.S movies... dude is a true visionary
Well, I'm in!
DC SALIVATING FOR THIS MASTERPIECE...this is SNYDERVERSE!!!
Wow
Опять феминисто-пидорская дичь
DUNE MEETS STAR WARS
5 bags of popcorn!
Weird , it's like a blend of great movies into 1 , based on the actors and elements of the movie. A little over the top for a first movie but interesting.
Yay...  yet another "brave and stunning female" trash movie.  Sad and pathetic.
Seems Like Can’t Wait
Looks like generic action horseshxt like every other movie. I wish people would actually adapt cool sci-fi books instead of whatever this crap is over and over again
If Netflix deliver this type of content it's enough to keep me subscribed to then
Looks like an AI mashup of every scifi.
it seems like Snyder is continuing his man child style of creating worlds. I saw laser rifles, lightsabers and a gryphon in this trailer alone. all you need now is some kind of sci fi motercycle with only one wheel thats drive real fast and makes a high pitched sound XD
Lightsabers?...Star Wars inspired? Why not ☺️
OK, I’m in.
Snyder is a GOAT. Should have been released in theaters but I can't wait regardless.
Washed out colours, copious amounts of slow motion shots, artificial looking CGI sceneries… yeah, that's clearly a Zack Snyder movie.
Serious potential. Post Disney Star Wars was boring me anyway. This could be it!
Zack Snyder  🤣😂😂🤣😅😅😅
If this succeeds, we get a 40k series.
Finally, a testosterone driven Star Wars
Snyder opened the Cinematic Spice Cabinet and said, "All of it."
Oh well, at least it's not The Fountainhead.
Would like to see these movies in a Theatre!
We all know the story is gonna be trash, I have more faith in AI writing the stories than Hollywood writters......
Too bad on Pedoflix
Looks exactly like 300 but in the future or some sort.
astonishing trailer
Looks interesting but I am so confused on what the story is. There’s no cohesiveness in the trailer
This is star wars in my headcanon
Is that lady lumiya in the trailer?
Another american masterpiece with evil huwyte men and mystery meat multiracial demiqueer peotagonists
I assume Disney passed on this because it has strong competent white men.
Wow....how original.  Still waiting for the f*cking 16:9 version of justice league.  Snyder can shove that 4:3 POS up his pretentious *ss.
I thought Odin died and where is Thor?
Zack guarantees goose bumps.
I hope it doesnt end being like Jupiter Ascending
Cornier than a cob, cheesier than a pizza
Why it looks like combination of Dune, 300 & Star Wars
Somewhere Zack Snyder jerks of on this trailer right now
Wowm, they rebooted star wars?
I guess Kathleen Kennedy is crying now cause Snyder has more Star Wars in his little fingers, than Disney had for years. I have spoken
well. at least its in color…
well. at least its in color…
well. at least its in color…
Synder never disappoint us.
PLease make this the beginning of the warhammer verse
When he said doa che chi chen I felt that
Poor Djimon. He said that he is barely able to pay his bills for what he earn as an actor🤑 Hopefully his character will live long enough to appear in the second part cause Djimon really need more money😉
Star Wars: The Snyder Cut
Zack’s starting another franchise!
No theatre release date? Pass.
Looks like a "steroid" mixture of Dune, Game of Thrones and Star Wars...
Looks pretty good.
Absolutely the best movie trailer I have ever seen!👏  Zack Snyder achieved something incredible here with this new IP. Cannot wait to see it !🔥
Looks and sounds aweful
No something with what seems to be a huge world can just be two movies!
Looks epic
I am a fan of Zack Snyder but why does he always use slow motions 😞😞😞😞 in every scene
looks bad
generic boredom
I don't think I've ever seen a more Jack Snyder trailer. Grab an OLED TV everyone, cause we can make sure half the screen while be dark at all times, at least.
Please... just don't make her a Mary Sue. A character needs weaknesses and strengths. Don't do a Rey, please.
Yeah I might take a peek at this
Of course it is the strong female character who carries the story. Who thought it. I forgot women can do anything only 3 times better. The trailer did not convince me btw.
wtf is this cgi :Ddd zack need to stop making films its  getting out of control
oh so this is like Dune but not as good.
There aren't enough explosions ... give me more explosions !!
REBEL MOON 🌙 is the beginning of a new SAGA and Zack Snyder has the ambition of LUCAS.  In the trailer we see only a tiny part of this universe.  For the story we see JIMMY the android (voiced by Anthony Hopkins) telling the story of an ISSA child.  We see a kingdom the death of a giant Eagle KING and ORDER preaching the word and destroying after they pass.  KORA in the warlike past, refugees in a peaceful village.  Ships of the ORDER are approaching KORA it will be destruction it has been found.  KORA with allies rebels against the ORDER.
i got some dune vibe
Lightsabers and Hippogriffs, count me in
Looks ok, but the screenplay seems as if pieced together from a dozen or more sci-fi/fantasy blockbusters on both film and TV from the last 40+ years and not truly original. Hounsou is an amazing actor.
Feels like Dune.
Looks great can't wait to see it..
so many established sci-fi and fantasy elements on this film(s), i just hope they made an original and fresh story - not boring and formulaic. it remains to be seen...only on Netflix.
Looks great but the music sounds like Dune
It's good to see Sci Fi getting a lot of love this year. I've been hungry for it after all the superhero garbage.
Only on Netflix? F***! Netflix needs to do theatrical releases.
seems like a total blast, can't wait!!
Don't underestimate the power of ZACK SNYDER
Justice league sequels too please Zack 🙏
I'm still going to pirate it.🏴‍☠🏴‍☠🏴‍☠☢☢☢
Only on Netflix? This is something for the big screen, damn 😩
Weird mix between "Battlefield Earth" & "Dune". And too much slow-mo sequences...
This movie it's a cocktail of 1000 other movies; VERY DISAPPOINTED. And please stop using this f...cking slow motion
I’m so over Zack Snyder and this Dune rip off.
Do you know the story of Darth Plagues the wise? 😂
Wish Charlie Hunnam could speak. Alas
I'm just glad to see a new IP. So tired of Star Wars and Marvel milking...
Was that a boack Buckbeak?
Nice to see Buckbeak getting more roles now that Harry Potter is over, I heard the industry can be tough for Hippogriffs
Well...this looks interesting. I just hope Zack has got a good screenwriter to back him up. Snyder proved many times, that he's a great visual artist and has some great ideas for the movies, just needs the help to frame that nicely in a coherent story, with great and well written characters and that's it. Ka-ching!
Whaaaaaaaaeeeeeeeeeee????????????????????????? Why not in theatre??
love it when someone actually creates something
wow looks amazing and awesome another Zack snyders masterpiece is on they way cant wait
I hope it better than that zombie movie. I wasn't feeling that at all but I am a huge Snyder fan
whats the point of a trailer if you dont understand a thing and it ends up being a dumpster dive. I love Snyder but theres nothing in this project, looks like star wars rip off or smthng
I did not understand a thing, but this looks amazing!!!!!!
a 4 min trailer lmfao😂
More like Rebel Mid
Peak fiction
Yes, Please! Halfway through the trailer, I thought I saw a "John Carter" cameo, but it's one of the characters. Right? That would be cool though! However you slice it, this looks like what would happen if you did mix John Carter, Firefly, and D&D with Dune. I'm all in!
Rebel Moon is going to become a classic. The movie looks across between Battle Beyond the Stars and Serenity.
You can say many things about Snyder but it is sure he has visions like no other.
When i see Zack i insta watch lol
Would buy 10 tickets if Zack makes wh40k
Who else is here for Charlie Hunnam?
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
This is more Star Wars than Star Wars
New Era, Let it begins!!!!
STAR WARS MEETS GAME OF THRONES MEETS CLASH OF THE TITANS
another boring show with boring people with bleached white teeth when everything around is drowning in dirt.. yes, this is how I imagine this could look... Did anyone in GoT care about good looking (Jamie aside) Poster people... yawn... waste of money and trying to please an already neurotic audience that cares too much about good looks.. The makers miss the point of telling a good story and go for looks instead..
what a mess😂
this looks great.
Looks like Warhammer. Imagine if Amazon would hijack Zack and pair him with Cavill again to make Warhammer series.
Snow white trailer finally out!!!!
Crap, written by Zack Snyder. Dude is a good director, but needs proper writers.
Sucks
Looks like 10 movies in one
I can already hear Cinema Sins saying “Narration” and sinning the movie 😂😂
Ahhh another Snyder project w an obnoxious score that takes me right out of the story. Great work.
-You like sci-fi, or fantasy? -(Snyder) YES!
That's the new star wars for our generation !
Looks like a combo of Star Wars, the Witcher and GOT...let's see.
king of generic video game aesthetic
Say what you want about Zack Snyder..but his movies have heart.
I don't know. I hope for the best but I'm getting a real Jupiter Ascending vibe. All sizzle no steak.🤔
Am I going to buy a subscription for this? YES
What is Sons of Anarchy doing in the future🤔😉
I'm There. This will be the only reason I will finally get Netflix.
And to think this couldve been Star Wars.
Really cool that they didn't have one of those lame joke parts after the title drop
Jedi boss babes in Dune with John Carter of Mars? What? I´m conflicted, but I will try it out. Yes, it´s really, really "original" - but I absolutely loved Sucker Punch (please don´t judge me).
Please No identify politics or social agenda. It may have a chance if you stick to telling an original story.
while im expecting this to be another overhyped snyder flick, meaning all sizzle no steak, im somewhat surprised theyre releasing this on netflix, this looks like something they would usually put in theaters
Dune, Star wars, Narnia and some Automata. 😅🎉
Vote for theater release
This looks awful. It doesn't tell me anything in terms of generating anykind of interest or excitement. It appears to be a confused mess and a half-baked hodge-podge of everything from "The Neverending Story and "Harry Potter" to "Star Wars" and Firefly"...👎👎
In a Galaxy Far Away.........
It looks like if star wars, dune , harry Potter and inglorious bastards had a kid
Star wars meets witcher meets lord of the rings meets Dune
God I hope DC REGRETS HARD they let him go
All I see in this fog of smoke is weak cliche talk and okay visuals.
Okay now this is good, but my question is , Why buckbeak is here?
After this snyderverse is coming
Mixbag of previous movies ive seen a thousand times. Some of the CGI looked dated. Where are the bloods and gore? Where's the "R" rated part ?
This looks so frickin wicked awwshum!! ❤❤❤❤
Is this one of those AI generated ones? Cause it looks like GOT and Star Wars got tossed in a blender with a handful of smaller franchises.
No way… a girl boss…. Talk about ground breaking!
Netflix:"How about some more Slow Motion?"  Snyder:"Say no more!"
I’m trying to focus on this visual style which I think making me loosing my sights lol.  Don’t really like this wash out color tone of this movie
looks fantasitic
It a theatre worthy movie🍿🎥
so... much... CG.  ugh.
This looks horrible. It's like a copy and paste of the last 5 years of sci-fi movies but direct to netflix. Hope it turns out ok.
What... the...   It look like a pile of crap.
No more Slow Motion  this time
Woman of steel
Zack Snyder Zacksnydering today!
Wow... just wow
Anyone else super stoked to hear "Three Days" by Jane's Addiction infused through that trailer?  Got me pumped!
This is what passes as original now? We've just been sucker punched!
Another possibly promising film I will never see because Netflix refuses to stop supporting terrorism and CP.
Me: I want Warhammer 40K! Mom: We have Warhammer 40K at home! Warhammer 40K at home:  Seriously, this just looks like a mish-mash of everything from dune to 40k to star wars, with 0 personality or originality.
Visulas are not stunning Slow motion too much Also the movie will not be story oriented   I will skip
Remember when Zack Snyder made good movies? Yeah me neither.
Damn...yoooo this is dripping with style.
We need Zach Snyder to do the Red Rising series next! 🤩
Se ve que va a hacer super epica esta pelicula 🤑🤑🤑💁🏻‍♂💁🏻‍♂🚬😁👌🏻
Looks mid, my time is more valuable than mid.
okay, the first time in a long time i did not hate it !! Cape Flappin!
Is this like a star wars thing?!!
I don't care what y'all say I've been waiting for this movie
First part i was like "so it's just dune with a female protagonist?" but then i saw zach snyder so i'll bite.....
LFG!!!!!
Thank you ...  God bless you sir.  Synder General Sir.❤
So Dune plus Star Wars with lots of slow motion.
Well that looks disappointing
Best Star Wars since "Rouge One" ❤
Wait, no theatrical release???
Wow illuminati demonic symbols all over this film.
Another modern "strong female" movie with lazy writting? 🧐
so star was, dune and warhammer 40k. i won't hope for originality i just hope this will be enjoyable
Wow wow wow wow.
Ok, I'm interested
I Love To See Charlie Hunnam On Rebel Moon 🌙
An Epic to the senses..
No
STAR WARS (SNYDERCUT)🔥🔥🔥
An Action Packed Movie Directed By Zack Snyder Is All i want.
Wow every single snyder-ism is here in copious amounts…it’s like he snyder-ed his hand and flung it at the audience. Ill still watch it!
Wasn't this already made and called Dune?
Snyders stuff seems to divide people but i love it. His stuff is super stylised i know but every frame is like an epic painting and if you paused the movie you could frame the image and you could stare at it for hours picking out scenery, expressions, lighting and motions which tell the story of the moment. All the slow mo, love that too. It allows you to savour a moment even longer.
this is literally the most Zack Snyder thing I've ever seen
Looks better than episode 7-9
2:54 😮😮😮😮😮 lightsabers.
😏Zack id love a 4 hour movie from this
Looks good.
So... here's the issue... Gareth Edward's movie just looks way prettier.
This movie should be released in theatres. 😂
it's going to be "EPIC"
FINALLY an original story!! I had lost faith that they could do anything other than remake older better movies. This looks fantastic!!
So there’s a book adaptation right?!?!?
What the hell did I just watch?
I feel like we need another Mad Max movie
I feel like this is going to be another Sucker Punch
Another Zack Snyder's mess, can't wait
ChatGPT please make a movie trailer with all the fantasy cliches please
Damn you folks are easily impressed. Right now this looks ok, not really living up to the hype.
Dune 2.0??
More Snyderslop that will fail
2:53 lightsaber
Harry Potter’s Buckbeak is in this 😂😂😂
More woman power BS
It's pretty bold to make a two part movie for a brand new IP... I am in!!!
Wow, I applaud them for even revealing the part II release date as well. That’s how you show faith in your product and that is how you avoid wasteful spending; shooting everything together just makes good business sense in my opinion.
So glad Disney didn’t let him make a Star Wars movie… this looks way better
WOW...
Just great, another movie filled with mediocre CGI and a "strong" female character who was told love is a weakness. 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Zack 🔥🔥🔥
A by-product of all other sci fiction fantasies that has come before. A continuity of epic sagas. Yep. This meets that. Looks impressive but derivative.
If you can tell me the story you get 50 bucks
Looks great. But I still want to see JL2 and JL3.
Why does it feel like it's trying to be several things at once? The trailer throws a lot at you, and I'm not sure what to make of it It's like Dune + Star Wars + Harry Potter + Firefly all at once, and I am a little afraid it's going to be more spectacle than substance I remain hopeful but skeptical
This is so over the place, it looks like it was created with AI
Eye of horus symbolism everywhere everytime.
If dune , Star Wars , a comic book and anime could have a baby it’d be REBEL MOON
Sweet, another ridiculous girl boss movie? LOL
Some stuff looks cool but overall I’m not feeling this one.
OMG THIS LOOKS AMAZING!!!!
Bro was the spider guy originally gonna be darth maul back when this was a star wars movie? I see the Maul vibes on him
What sets Disney, HBO, Paramount and Prime apart from Netflix? It's the concept of merchandise residuals. These companies derive a significant portion of their revenue from merchandise sales associated with their content. When a movie is released, revenue streams in from ticket sales and subscriptions through streaming platforms. However, what distinguishes Netflix from its counterparts is its current lack of emphasis on residual merchandise income. While Netflix has successfully capitalized on merchandise sales for its hit series "Stranger Things," it lags behind companies like Disney (with Marvel and Star Wars), HBO (with Game of Thrones, Justice League, and Dune), Paramount's (Star Trek) and Prime (with The Boys) in consistently monetizing residual income from merchandise. This includes a wide array of products such as action figures, clothing, collectibles, posters, and even spin-off books – all inspired by the characters, themes, and stories that captivate audiences on screen.  CEO Richard Hastings has acknowledged the missed opportunities in merchandise income that Disney, Amazon, and Paramount have seamlessly tapped into. In a strategic move to change this trajectory, Netflix has enlisted the expertise of Zack Snyder. Renowned for his penchant for expansive story universes, Zack Snyder's previous involvement with HBO's Justice League was abbreviated. However, he harbored aspirations to craft his own sprawling space-centric universe, akin to Marvel's Star Wars and Star Trek. And now, that vision is becoming reality – this marks the inception of Netflix's new universe.  The remarkable aspect of this venture lies in its complete novelty. Unlike the current landscape dominated by established franchises with rich backstories across comics, TV shows, books, and more, Netflix's new universe is a clean slate. This absence of existing material provides unparalleled creative freedom and possibilities. In essence, what sets Netflix's initiative apart is its determination to tap into the merchandise residuals sphere, leveraging the vision and creativity of Zack Snyder to forge an entirely original universe. This bold endeavor sets the platform on a unique trajectory, one untethered by existing source material and poised to carve its niche in the ever-evolving landscape of entertainment.
Looks awesome
Star wars plus dune plus harry potter plus avatar
Is this at least going to get a theatrical release ?!
Papa Midnite never ages.
Is there a bigger better quality video?
Bro tell me how 45 second trailers give away the whole movie but I just watched 3 minutes and have no idea what this gloriously insane project will be about.
zack is an incredible artist
Wow I was excited to watch this but forget it. Good luck rebel woke.
What Disney Star Wars should have been
Looks stunning  Apart from dune, jupiter ascending,  john carter and some planet of the apes mixed in it was a totally fresh idea Not
badass and attractive female character, and  badass male characters.
Wow woW
Zach Snyder’s ‘Flash’, please.
Rebel Moon is just a remake of Jupiter Ascending... change my mind
I thought Zack would be cured of J.J. Abram's *_LENS FLARES_* mind-sickness by now.
Which sci-fi/fantasy trope do you want to include?  EVERY ONE!!!!!
so.... its suckerpunch 2?... it looks fun imo
This is like a mixture of Star Wars and Narnia.
The shallow depth of field is soooooo distracting
Goddamn! Goddamn! This feels f*cking epic! I watched this trailer 3 times already. Until December??? Fudge that I need it now!!!
Now this is a good star wars movie i can get behind 😂
wonder if zack snyder is up for star wars
Can't wait to watch this on my phone.
Mid.
Well, starts the trailer with a Gladiator rip-off hand-over-wheat shot. Some stuff looks good, some CGI, looks like toy ships, hopefully they're not done rendering yet.... But the main thing is that I had enough with Kings, Queens, Princesses and all the free-loading monarchic BS. Hopefully I'm wrong and he pulls it off..... Good luck Snyder.
Wtf lol
I suspect that more than half of this movie will be in slow motion 🥴
Looks like utter garbage.
Also known as  "Star Dune of Mars"
This is going to be fantastic!
Well this looks absolutely epic
So it's basically a Dune knock off, since it's a Zach Snyder film it's gonna have great visuals but everything else is gonna be garbage
Dune rip-off, with a girl boss. Another box office flop.🤣
Strong Jupiter Ascending vibes
The slow motion movie 2023 edition
I'm here for Charlie Hunnam, and Charlie Hunnam only!
Anyone feels like some shots were made with generative AI tool?
If this is half as epic as the trailer it's gonna be my new favorite thing. Looks like Dune mixed with foundation with Zach Snyder action.
Looks freaking awesome 🌟 can't wait to see it 👏👏👏
When Disney wont let Zack direct Star Wars he makes his own...
Rebel Moon - The Return of Slow Motion
Man Dune part 2 looks nothing like part 1
😇 💩 ⚽🏈🏉🏀.
Yeah!  Hunger Jupiter Rising Games looks great!
Loving the music choice in this!!! Can't wait til Christmas!
Looks unique and interesting. Visuals are typically overly stylised but kinda fit a sci-fi fantasy.  Also confirms that Lucasfilm were right to keep him well away from Star Wars.
song please
Will the movie fully fit my tv screen?
Is this going to get a limited theatrical release?
1:56 Snyder literally just made a Visas Marr rip off right here.
Zack Snyder is the Hottest Filmmaker who knows how to take audience to another world😊
Sir Anthony Hopkins is tryna pay some bills. Yeeesh.
I see you Illuminati
What is this? And why is it awesome!
Although I miss Larry Fong (Snyder's D.P. for many of his movies), it's pretty rare for a major director to also be credited as the director of photography. This looks just as good visually as many of his movies and it's impressive to see him helming the camera. (Army of Darkness too!)
This already looks better than anything Star Wars put out in the last decade aside from Mandalorian
The girl that's the key to everything!!!!
This looks so dumb
The name Zack snyder is enough
Excessive and unnecessary slow motion (of course) aside, could be good. But I've burned too many times by good trailers for what turned out to be bad movies when it comes to Snyder. So, interested, but skeptical
CINEMA
This looks like 3 different movies that have been chopped together
Let's go Rebel Moon. Hoping this tops Snyders Justice League
What is this garbage?
Everything is awesome except the plot. We have seen the same plot in Dune and star wars
It looks really cool all thought I got lost a little in the narrative part
Too bright, not enough slow motion.  4/10
PEAK
Hopefully it washes away the bad taste of disney star wars.
*YEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSS !!!!!!*  👍😲👍😲👍😲👍😲👍😲👍😲👍😲👍😲 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
What's this about
Wtf...  I love Zack sniders style.. Great 👍 Immer wieder ein augenschmaus
I cannot wait!!!!!
Looks like they saved on CGI for the second part of Dune. Instead, Timothée Chalamet now looks more like he could really fight.
Rebel Moon: A Star Wars Story
Wtf is this pos?!
Is that Jane's Addiction I can hear in the trailer?!
E.X.P.L.O.S.I.V.E!
Staring Ron Jeremy as the man who really doesn’t want any trouble.
“Love is weakness,” omg how many times am I going to have to hear that cliche line again 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Fuckyeah Snyder baby
This looks awesome
hmmm i dunno
Zack Snyder is kind of shallow as a film maker. This looks like a bit of a generic premise, but it could be pretty fun if executed well. And it has actors I like: Boutella, Malone, Hounsou, Hunnam. So I will definitely watch it.
Soooo Lord of the Star Wars and the Fellowship of Hogwarts basicly?❤ gonna watch it anyway haha
Dam this looks sick!
I love Zach Snyder as a director but I’ve never been a fan of his writing. I think he should do more graphic novel adaptations.
YESSSSS!!!!...
Synder fans still begging for him to come back to DC 😂😂
Who is the main protagonist?
Is this a star wars stuff?
Zack Snyder's visual prowess ......
this looks more like warhammer than Star Wars
Pseudo dune movie.. hmm
Reminds me of dune meets star wars but on steroids!
I can't wait 💯 🔥
Full chub. 🫡
Can't wait to see this. I absolutely love Zack Snyder. DCs loss
Damm, this seems some stars wars with 300movie together, it seems promising.
Not sure what this is but it's not Star Wars. Looked like a mashup of scenes from Dune, Conan, Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Jupiter Ascending, Braveheart, Prometheus and some more Dune.
Still ripping off Ridley Scott’s “hand in the wheat at magic hour” trope all these years later. Geez. He already ripped that off in 300, now he’s rehashing his own rehash. Good god.
Damn this got me hyped.
This looks like somebody put Star Wars,  Dune,  300 and Lord of the Rings into ChatGPT and had it write a script.
Looks like there gonna be a lot of stupid typical snyder slow mo. Atleast color looks much better than his dc movies. Just hoping this won't be as dumb as army of the dead
Ive actually been really excited for this since it was announced. Man, y'all should really release this im theaters. Netflix you're leaving money on the table.
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Pl- sorry wrong franchise
BRUH !! ... yes plz
Some of this looks a little wonky but overall there's clearly been some effort put into this project.
After seeing Dune, i can’t help but feel negative type of way over extremely CGI’d films
I’m so excited for this. I knew the scale of it all was big but oh my lord this is massive
I feel like critics are gonna unfavorably compare this to _Dune_ when it comes out.
Jupiter Ascending, Farscape, Defiance, Dune, Star Wars, Blade Runner, Zelda?
Looks ok.  But honestly...  I'm so tired of CGI.  Bring back practical effects and make up. I want something that feels real again.   It's not a hard ask.
Zack Snyder makes a solid looking movie filled with allegory and religious imagery but he has yet to make a movie that’s actually well written with a cohesive plot. Man of steel came pretty close.
Gave me dune Star Wars fantasy blade runner and some dc vibes and he man
Dune 3 looks awesome!
They need to give this a theatrical release! At least for a weekend because this looks so freaking good!
They put Dune, Game of thrones, and warhammer all in one with a dash of star wars....and im FOR IT.
This gives me Warhammer 40k vibes
Filmed for Bloodrunclear. So much material, take and cut.
…
Absolute CINEMA 🤩🤩🤩
" Who among you is willing to die for what you believe? "  That's  Zack asking us.
Is this set in the future or another galaxy?
Some Three Days.. Nice
Dune meets Star Wars meets Harry Potter
I like Zack.
looks cool but also all over the place. I got the feeling I saw a trailer for 3 different movies
Looks nice... let's hope the script isn't a juvenile sh*tshow.
Space Gladiator is looking promising
I've no idea what the  plot of the  film is, but its vibe is Jupiter Rising, Last Samurai, Magnificent Seven, Avitar; Flying with Griffins (OK, I made the last part up)
SnyderGod
Looks like a super cheap c-movie😂
Finally a great Star Wars movie...
The song is Three Days by Jane's Addiction
Sci-fi Greek mythology inspired by star wars? I’m in
Amazing trailer. Definitely going to give it a chance!
Strangely heavy 5th Element and Gladiator vibes here. In places, anyway.
This looks amazing
This gonna replace Disney’s mishandling of Star Wars
An sci-fi epic original not based on a comic book ? I’m down
This looks absolutely garbage 😂😂😂
This was inspired from star wars, which was inspired from Dune, which was inspired from The Foundation! What a great time for sci-fi!!
Please God put this in theaters.
"Do you know the story of the princess Issa?" "No but I have heard of the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise"
Meh.  More Hollywood eye candy.
Looks epic. I feel like Zack wanted to make a Star Wars film but Disney turned him down and he is making this instead
Well, this is the most zak snyder zak snyder movie ever, no idea what ive just watched, but ill defo watch it 😂
Zack Snyder Visuals are Top Shelf 🔥
James Gunn's DCU is gonna flop hard.
The only thing I liked is the girl at 2:42
Will it show in Cinemas?
This will make as much sense as that Army of the Dead. Snyder doesn't know how to tell stories.
Finally something original
This looks like those parody movies where they combine all the latest movies in a specific genre like Scary Movie. This guy watched Dune, Star Wars, John Carter of Mars, forgot he made Sucker Punch, rewatched that too and said “Bet”. Great cast, hope it has substance. His muddled computer graphics have improved.
ZACH SNYDER IS HIM
Not impressing me much... looks like regurgitated bits of a bunch of other action movies.  Nothing original to speak of.
Visually Stunning, as always. If the story is equally compelling It's a winner. Either way I support Zach Snyder in all of his endeavors because he pushes the envelope and shakes things up as all great artists should.  $•|° √@|•®
Wow this looks great and very epic I can't wait to see it and has a great cast too 😊❤
Zack Snyder is a top-tier storyteller. Also, the effects and cinematography in this trailer are amazing.
Stronk woman good bullshit.
Star wars , Dune and  lord of the rings walk into a bar ...first shot gave me gladiator vibes. This is something I would hope is shown in theaters. It looks immersive.
I’m getting Rogue One + Fifth Element / Eve Online Vibes. I’m hyped!
One word: GENERIC
Another amazing trailer from Zach Snyder! Because we all know that means the movie will be great! Right, guys? Like Sucker Punch? Remember? Guys? Anyone?.....Anyone....  😒
Look already better than the whole Flash movie
FROM ZACK SNYDER . . . The Director Who Constantly Falls In Love With His Own Style . . .
This movie looks long
Wow that was an amazing movie! I can't wait for the sequel!
Snyder wanted to make Dune/Star Wars so bad, but you know it's just going to be Riddick
OOOOOOH George Lucas is going to be maaaad!
This looks absolutely bonkers. In the best way possible.
Its like when sam raimi wanted to make a batman movie and the studio said no...to which he vowed, "Fine then, Ima make my own Batman!". And thus Darkman was born.
Whats with the doctor who spider creature doing, the film does look decent has a lot of dune, starwars resemblances
I just know this is gonna be a 2.5 hour movie but it’ll feel at least double that with all the slow motion
I feel like this will be Snyder's best work. I think that having an original story and full freedom on molding his own characters will really give him room to breathe his creativity and obvious passion
This trailer makes me realize again how dull and boring Dennis Villeneuve's Dune is. Grey, moorish and utterly dull, just like the director himself.
Looks like Great Value’s DUNE
salute
So is Anthony Hopkins just doing narrations or actually in the thing
holy crap this looks terrible
This might be his best work yet. Years and years of honing his talents and skill stack for a Starwars influenced sci-fi epic. I’m here for it.
When Snyder isn't making DC (except Watchmen). He's makes fantastic films (except sucker punch)
Considering it’s Netflix… this looks surprisingly good. We will see.
Love how failed Star Wars movie has katanas that look like light sabres
Awesome trailer...... Zack Snyder👍💯💥💥🔥🔥
So John Carter meets Dune meets Star Wars meets Harry Potter?
🔥🔥🔥
That looks flipping awesome 🙂
Since it's on Netflix, I'll watch it. Not sure I'd pay to see it at a theater though...
ZACK YOURE THE GOAT MAN
Jesus Christ that was alot. Still gonna watch it of course but damn !
Dollar store starwars...this Christmas.
took woke for me.. i saw too many people of color... GO WOKE GO BROKE
THE NEW SNYDERVERSE
World building looks incredible
Meh…
I heard this was originally supposed to be a Star Wars movie
It's like Star Wars, Harry Potter, Dune, and Game of Thrones had a baby
looks like garbage, cannot wait to not watch it
Villeneuve wannabe frfr
The amount of slow motion in this trailer😂  Excited for Rebel Moon, love Zack Snyder and his work.
JUST BRING IT
Looks great visally but that's never been an issue for Zach Snyder.  Let's hope there's some story to grab hold of us.
Glad this will be a 2 parter. When Snyder is given time he will make a true spectical.
I mean it looks alright
LOL add this to KK failures at Lucas Film this looks Amazing and Epic
This is going to be good. I hope disney is watching they can learn a thing or 2 or 3 or 10
I felt excited for a few seconds, but then i read that it was written by zack snyder, and now I'm back to indifference
Masters of the Universe: Rebel Moon
Did Zack Snyder just discover colour?
See Zack i would be all for it but im kinda over the whole female impowerment mood. GG's
This looks incredible!  It would probably be the Star Wars most of us were looking for.
snyder back with a bang
Say what you want about Zach Snyder. One thing he does well is infuse his films with enough tremendous visuals that it is quite easy to cut an epic trailer from them. There certainly is no dearth of awe inspiring action sequences you can use from anyone of his films.
Hyyyyyype 😮
Damn I wanted Dune but mom said we have Dune at home
w trailer🔥
Ehhh
FULL. BODY. CHILLS.
Some nice 40K vibes. Could have easily been turned into a 40K universe movie.
Just another cheap Star Wars knock off.    Pass.
I can't wait to watch it.
Looks like Warcraft, Gladiator and John Carpenter (of Mars 🤫) all in one, while attempting to be a Star Wars film.
The movie is looking good.... But please go back to DC universe!!! We need you!!
We want this on a big screen. Like if you agree.
Random bullshit: the movie.  Seriously: there's no tonal consistency here. This looks like every random sci-fi and fantasy trope squashed into one film.
I'll watch anything if you put Perry Farrell singing Three Days from Janes Addiction in the trailer.
Epic mess
I see inspirations from Dune, John Carter, Star Wars, with strong vibes from The Dark Crystal.  I am very excited I may have to up my plan to include 4K
I just hope this isn’t more eye candy with no nourishment…this is the post avatar error. You can’t just make a visually stunning film without a good story 🤦‍♂️
CANNOT wait to steal this from you NetFlix .... I love you make all this content for us pirates for free ... LOL
Looks quite epic, but could end up being a mess. We'll see!
Looks like a mix of Star Wars, Dune, and DnD
I am slightly interested. Looks like every white male character is a piece of furniture. But still slightly interested.
I'm glad we don't have to wait long for part 2 now.
It was fresh and worked in 300 but jeez the cut to slow mo during an action scene has been done to death. Has become self parody at this point. It’s the same thing over and over.
It’s looks ok
This looks like an epic.
What is even happening here
So what is the movie about?
need zach snyder on a warhammer movie
Looks like a knock off of star wars.
Please don’t kill off Dijmon Hounson he is a great actor !
It's Star Wars then.
This should be in theaters. .
Djimon always has that one obligatory scream that makes your hairs stand on end
Release the hype engine
thia movie better be three hours long
Gotta give them Credit for making something New and  original and not a reboot or sequel
I'm so sick of CG monsters
Let's go🔥
Mom can we go see Dune?  We already have Dune at home.  Dune at home:
why i hear Odin ? :D
Goat
I hope it’s good.
Well this looks promising 😮
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away…..
Total woke crap
Get ready for every other shot to be slo mo
OMG Give this movie Oscars, for its cinematography, coustume desgin, and VFX, Everything. this is the next sci fi classic
I just hope this movie is gonna end like the Dungeons and Dragons movie, an excellent cast in a surprisingly really fun, funny, enjoyable and engaging fantasy movie that was better than expected. So I have some hope for this
Tarzaan + StarWars + Harry Potter + Dune
I was excited until it said "story by Zack Snyder". Now I don't know what to think.
a girl looks like Gemma Chan & Madison Beer (Of EVANSCENCE)
Netflix, so... we can pretty much assume now that part 2 will be cancelled?
This is honestly just a Medieval version of Battle Beyond the Stars.
Starwars Westworld Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings all put together
Very nice
I see: 300, Gladiator, Harry Potter, Dune, Rogue One, Prey, Serenity, Doomsday, Chronicles of Riddick, Pitch Black, Reign of Fire, etc.  - and too cheap looking CGI 😞  But hey - could be entertaining...so I´ll check it out ;-)
"So is it like Star Wars? Dune? Game of Thrones? Or is it more like the MCU?"  "Yes"
Damn this looks good. I've got high hopes for this since Disney is trying to kill and bury Star Wars.
No thanks
Yet another reason why Kathleen Kennedy should be FIRED for that this film was Snyder's Star Wars pitch. This looks amazing, the story feels original and man... I hate to be her watching this trailer, realizing that she massively messed up by not making THIS a Star Wars film.
Oooooooooooooo excited !!!!!!
Definitely gonna watch! Love a good scifi
Looks amazing!
🔥🔥🔥
This looks like a glorious mess Zack Snyder churned out again, and I cannot wait to see it
Soo... I just looked up the movie in wikipedia to get the synopsis and it's very fanficy...like even the character names  Visually also looks derivative of star wars
DUNE CLONE WARS A JOHN CARTER STORY VOL. 1
Looks like a mixture of dune,Star Wars and Harry Potter
Why isnt this in theaters?
terrible picture quality
This looks promising, can't wait to watch this. Not gonna lie Im a little worried about the CG of that bird type creature @2:08. Gives me Witcher "goofy dragon" vibes, that could be a bummer. Hope that looks better in the release.
Another woman being a hero News flash nobody believe you you need more people 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So nothing to do with star wars,another flop!!
Visually impressive, points for risking it on a new IP, but good god if this is just another mary-sue girl-boss tossing around men 3 times her size it's gonna get heaped on the pile with the rest of the same trash.
oh my i hope the movie is as good as the trailer!
No wonder Disney passed on Zack Snyder's Star wars movie they knew he'd do it better
Slooooo Mooooooo
So, this is the story that was supposed to be a Star Wars movie? I can see that
Well, this is disappointing. The costumes look very bad, the main cast is filled with mediocre actors that already failed in so many other movies... For everything else, we'll have to wait and see but I didn't see anything in this trailer to get me excited (and I was before seeing it)
- This is madness... - Madness? This is REBEL MOON 😂
Dune from wish
This should have been a Star Wars movie as Snyder intended.
ffffffffffffLOP... FLOPPY FLOP FLOP
This seems extremely extremely extremely boring
The producers should have bet on themselves and put an epic film of this scale in cinemas first.
It's ok ok not bad but not even great also.
Oof. This looks... not good.
Satanic garbage. Glad it's not hiding anymore.
Blown away, looks so EPIC
Honestly, if the synopsis wasn't in the description, I wouldn't really know what this is about just from the trailer. It's very pretty...but the trailer tells you nothing. Hell, with those glowing swords and the name "Rebel Moon", I was trying to figure out whether this was a Star Wars spin-off or a trademark violation in waiting.
Two parts?!?! Bring it!!!
Should have been a 40k movie, but I'll take it.
Better not be 100 slow-mow scenes
Sofia Boutella is amazing I am looking forward to seeing this.
Snyder has a great visual eye I hope the writing is good
lucasfilm said no, he said yes, that's an epic trailer
That trailer is so full on that I am a little scared to watch the film.
Anthony Hopkins and his exposition dialogue is just perfect.
Riddick .....
This film is perfectly balanced between John Carter of Mars and Star Wars with that whole galaxy in peril with one child that will change course of everything.
I want the Snyder Cut
