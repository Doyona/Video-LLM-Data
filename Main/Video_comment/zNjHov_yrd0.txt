This made her break up with him.
Did bro change the title😭
“Please don’t leave me” aged like milk on a warm summers day
Now do this again but American version...
2025
The Thumbnail:Audi R8 V10  The real car:Fiat 500

G
8:30 please don’t leave him.. oh

That "please dont leave me" aged poorly
8:31 bro knew what was going to happen
I'm beginning to maybe doubt that Harry hit his mom
5:54 no I don’t feel my balls start to shake
I honestly would not be shocked if this was the catalyst for Shan leaving Chris because as great as this video was, it is admittedly kinda peak that Chris took his girl's car and let his mates kick a ball at it over and over again for a video without her knowing about it.
This video really costed him his girl
Theo’s hair in this is an absolute hate crime
She did leave him
hello
Hi

When you hear epic music in a normal video: Yay someone's gonna score! When you hear it in this video: Oh no the car's gonna get absolutely smashed
He wonders why she broke up with him
“Please dont leave me”
Bro just spend 150 quid on a relatinship lol

Wheres the audi
"Please don't leave me" famous last words before disaster
8:28 MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
That "please dont leave me" at the end went well didnt it...
Pure soul Shannon POV:it’s gonna be a normal day 5 hours later… She is crying and Chris is begging for her not to leave Pretty normal day in my books
"please don't leave me" aged well
please don’t leave me well this is awkward 😂😂😂😂
Yeah the 'Please don't leave me line' didn't age too well
Woah this has zero
Imagine Vik, JJ and Tobi were in this video 💀
You also have to feel bad for chris
Why are you trying to destroy her car omg rude
well "please don't leave me" didn't age well
this video is what broke the camels back
she took the cat he kept the car
I do this to girlfriends car any day. I take that chance. Let the boys have fun! 😂
This video aged well
Did he change the title from "Can I save the sidemen's shots at my girlfriend's car" or was it always like this
this video aged well
With the amount of views on this video you could've bought her a new car
Chris saying please don’t leave me to Shannon aged well
8:30 unlucky mate
you guys have to much money
Where is my car? Me and the boys: 8:05
8:29 'please don't leave me' Mission failed we will get them next time
*Ex girlfriend
May i say Shannon looks like Lauren Alexis?
This may not be the reason they broke up but this has to be one of the reasons 😂
What is the music he uses as the background music at the end
Who’s here after Chris and shannon broke up
Gotta love how the window is wound down slightly just for Simon's shot
"Please don't leave me"  Didn't age well.
Pls don’t leave me 😂😂😂
she's named after a river
The real reason why they broke up
i ain’t gonna lie i thought it was lauren alexis
‘Please don’t leave me’ is so underrated
Chris do not sidemen kick the ball to your car
P
Bro changed the title of the vid 😭😭
This was so legendary, her reaction was pure gold
"ᵖˡᵉᵃˢᵉ ᵈᵒⁿᵗ ˡᵉᵃᵛᵉ ᵐᵉ" 😂
this aged well
6:21
the thumb nail is so click bait...i thought it was gonna really be a r8
Ethan is used to kicking cars
That touch and window hit was kinda clean from ethan
Did Simon shot really broke tempered glass? the power on that shot must be insane...
Simon at 6:54 Also Simon at 7:07
how can you do this when you got a baddie like her
They were aiming for it anyway
solid shots
buy her a car now
Lol he changed the title. R.I.P
Simon genuinely felt bad 😂
Classic
𝕋𝕙𝕖 𝕥𝕙𝕦𝕞𝕓𝕟𝕒𝕚𝕝 𝕥𝕙𝕠
They’ve broken up now and I think I know why
buy her a new car
Please dont leave me 🤣🤣🤣
"PLEASE DONT LEAVEEE MEE"
Simon just pretty much shrugging it off until his "I feel awful" was super hard
bro doesn't connor for a spilt second look Salah?
Come to sweden im waiting for you 😈😈😈😈
8:30 had me dead bro
I wish Connor was more involved other than GK and the random attempt he's got jokes and is always laughing instead of just sitting in the back
8:23 sounds like buck from ice age 😂😂
Chris is just a menice
😀
Chriiisssssssss
“Please don’t leave me” 🤣
I like that fiat r8 🤣
“Please don’t leave meee” 😂😂💀💀
He now sleeps in the couch
This comment has no likes and this isn’t edited
Not an audi r8 in the thumbnail
bro did that actuually break the building window
6:30 🚗⚽️😂
They are hitting it so much harder than their regular penalties and they don't even realize they are kicking so cleanly. LOL
Chris do your car poor Shannon she didn't even agree
Yeah just commenting so it goes viral
You know she's a keeper when you legit let your friends destroy her car for free and she still sticks around
THEO AND SIMON ARE DIFFF
*dumb rich assholes*
Poor car :(
lauren blexis
Am I tripping or does she look similar to lauren Alexis?
That glass is a collectors item
I hated every second of this video. What a horrible idea.
Oh... Damn.... The click bait got me ..... 😂😂😂
He’s literally every autistic kid playing football👏🏽
'
Dude put a ring on her, likes of her do not come that often.
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
“Please don’t leave me!” 😂🤣😅
wow
Love the shithouse of slightly opening the window so it can shatter easier
It's funny how car insurance came on before and after the video
8:30 plEaSe dOn'T LeAvE mE
Chris: Pls dont leave me
The way Chris showed this to Shannon and went please don't leave me
She looks exactly like Lauren alexis
Window was rolled down so it would break at the slightest hit. Nice try tho chris
el sueño de todo niño
2:57 i love harry so much XD
Plot twist he bought his girlfriend a lambo after
"Please don't leave me" 🤣🤣
£150? Imagine if he repaired all the dints too 😂😂
150 pound after but makes 12k of the vid
Poor Shannon 🤣🤣
shannon really cried over that ting
Those volleys are terrifyingly awful
they destroyed ethans gtr but not this
Cars have safety glas, it would never break like that.
i click on this thinking its a audi then see a fiat 500
to be fair he spent 150 pounds on this video and hes probably gonna make a lot more than that. so fair play chris
it’s a fiat 500, it deserves much worse
Why does Shanon look like lauren Alexis?
The “pleeeeeease don’t leave meee” at the end was hilarious
You racist
Just like LDN Movements
150quid for 7.8m views not so bad innit
You should have bought her a really nice car tho
Totally planned, window is lowered about 1cm making it really easy to shatter.
8:33 LMAO
I thought u would buy her a new car 🥵
You know if the window was closed properly it wouldnt have smashed🙉
if Chris's car was actually an audi r8 like in the thumbnail, we would be seeing Chris on the streets sleeping on a bus stop bench
so fake
Title: "Can i save the sidemen's shots at my car" Calfreezy: Am i a joke to you?
sure no one's gonna notice he replaced the fiat500 with an Audi R8 in the thumbnail
Simon wrecked it
Please don't leave meeeee
Harry: *Trying his absolute hardest to break the window but fails* Simon: *Breaks the window* Harry: OH NOOO
8:30 ,,please don't leave me" 💀
How fake should we make it look?  Yes.
Bro everyone of you in bank account have 6 figures.. and still care for a glass of a car which cost 150 quid… and wtf was that reaction you didnt burn the car.
...how tf r u two together?
all im gonna say is shannon has the patience of a saint with you chris 😂
Is the song at 5:52 saying do you feel your balls start to shake do you feel the earthquake?
This is weird or nah???
1:07 = jomama Like if u agree
Nice “Audi”    I know it’s a thumnail
Have u guys ever shot the building's window?
Awhh, are you okay? *Car blushes*:Yeah yeah, im ok :)  Not you, *the building behind you*
Lesson Learned:- Never trust a thumbnail before asking someone if he watched it to see if it's really the thumbnail! 🧐
8:31 chris md's last famous words😂
Honestly thought that was Lauren Alexis at one point
No no no. You don’t fix the window you buy her a Lamborghini. Simple fix really
glass everywhere on the pitch
What girlfriend have you got now Chris?
I wont be surprised if the window smashing is fake😂😂😂
The audi r8 in the thumbnail
Where was this filmed?
Love how there’s only like 3 people from the sdmn
The window was rolled down a bit to make it easier to break.
To be fair now you should make a video with your gf where she plays "keeper" while the lads take shots at your car, im sure itd be a banger
Hello
🤛🏻🤛🏻
deserved fiat500 driver
Where tf is the r8
Bro she is mega fit
this is so sad
mazoeeeeeeeet
PLEASE DONT LEAVE MEEE🤣
Poor that 🚗
how do you compare a audi r8 to a fiat in the intro??? damn
It’s only a fiat. She should get a real car
I wonder if Simon realizes he's the main character.
best video ever
I leave a like for Simon
https://youtu.be/f-xuhSpqi7E
“please don’t leave me “ 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bruh I'm thinking about the poor keeper that's gonna be diving there after the video with all the glass on the ground lmao
those guys are such typical british lad, really wouldnt make anyone want to live in the UK
Chris you've done well there son
that window is worth more than that car
4:01 first time I have seen Chris abuse without the censor
Chris should put a big mat down for future videos like this
Why broke a car when you can just sell it or give this to someone who needs a car or a homeless
I did even take the shot and I feel so bad
His face is like.. Oh no I thought It's not gonna break it's world's strongest glass😱
The fact the question just change like " can't i save it?" To "Can we break it?"
that most probably is a sugar glass notice  how the way it breaks
8:10 he is laughing and his gf is crying
doesnt she look like lauren alexis
2:03 he took that back 😂😂
Wasn't she in a sidemen tinder
Damn! Chris must be ashamed of his girlfriends car if the thumbnail is an audi
Me watching this in 2022: WHERES KSI
Hah! Very funny chris
Simon has a hard shot
Ethans laugh is so funny 😂
you know the window was not lifted all the way up on purpose so it breaks.If it was all the way up then it would be unbreakable...
no SIUUUUU?
Why didn't you put the windows down lol.
6:21
This is the first time i’ve ever heard chris swear 😂😂
Where’s KSI
Wow.
Loving cals drip
in the thumbnail its a r8 and now its a fiat
She’s cute
Not even mad about the clickbait. In fact I'm happy it was a Fiat 500
With the amount of money this video probably made, you could just get her a brand new car no problem 😂
Shannon: crying* Me: is that Lauren Alexis
And Simon makes the shot! The crowd goes wild! Shannon : *crying* Chris : You're actually crying! Please dont leave meee
Nice Audi clickbait
"please don't leave me" 😂😂
The groundsman would like to have a word. How did you get them to agree to glass all over the pitch 😂
u derserve a like
Great stephen tries reference
Only reason I watched this video was because I thought it was the car from the video picture was getting hit
why does she car so much about a Fiat 500? you could literally buy her a new one instantly
do a 1 year anniversary
he has 6 mil subs but stilll drives that
Plz don’t leave me got me dead
4:38 “AAAAÆÆEEEE”
4:33
Is she ok
and how did they clean every bit of glass on the pitch...seems really stupid to do that in a public place
Plz don't leave me haaa
I know nothing about car repairs but 150 doesn't seem bad
literally put his relationship on the line
#content
Come on Simon for Carly I died because of the memories
Are we all gonna ignore that the thumbanail is just straight clickbait?
what a nice r8's body kit
All fiat 500s deserve this
Alternative title: "How to lose your girl tutorial"
She is fit asf
pleas don't leave me HAHAHAHAH
Shanan and Chris reacting to it had me dying😂😂
hehehe siuuuuuuu
Dunno why I laughed so hard at this
When Chris wants a new car this happens
nice r8 bro
Next videos titled "I bought my girlfriend a new car!"
Why did i think she was Lauren Alexis
Please tell me you cleaned the broken glass after ?
Why would u let a guy who’s catchphrase is time to smash it hit ur gfs car😂😂😂
It’s the clickbait r8 for me
8:30 was personal
So Chris when did Calfreezy and Theo Baker join the Sidemen
What’s the name of the metal song at the very beginning?
bro, is australians would crush teh volley pry, seeing that our whole country’s sport is AFL
the way chris said please dont leave me at the end is so funny
Simon: puts maximum power that could finish Hulk Also Simon: “I feel terrible”
6:20
2:14 I thought chris was family friendly lol
the plz dont leave me at the end 😭😭😭
THE CAR SHOULD BE CALLED BIG FAT GOALY
Shannon reaction was funny
Just watching this again. Not seeing the slightly open passenger side window😂
Ok
The thumbnail 😂😂
Got same ball lol
just give the car to someone like me with nothing.
8:07
The level of disrespect.
Simon brought a whole new meaning to “time to smash it”😂😂
Horrible video idea
theo looks like prime mourinho
Isn't really an R8
The “Please don’t leave me” is MINT
your so bad
8:31
I love he says sidemen but there 3 of them
So where’s the r8
8.30 made my day
It cost me 150 quid.. but this video made me thousands so who cares
8:30 thats the most funniest thing I've seen in a chris md video 😂😂😂
I am correct it was a Audi R8 in the thumbnail but the car is a Fiat 500😂😂
The thumbnail car, then the car in the vid 😭💀
4:20 you to Ethan 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
2:59 you to Harry
2:03 😂😂😂 shithousery award 2021 Jamie vardy is in trouble 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Where’s jj
Dents 150$ also? Hmm
Glass all over the football pitch is gonna make Sunday league even more deadly
150 Punds for a vid that has more than 6 million views is a massive net positive.
well my car was totaled 3 weeks ago so she got lucky
Three sidemen and their mates (legends also) Hmm. Misleading title eh?
A ball won't do much damage to a car.. The panels pop back themselves
6 yard was stupid
me n d boys destroying the math teacher's car after shes not lettin us to play during p.e
With the window slightly down like that if the ball hits clean that's Smashing it surely !
Mymmmhbgmb
why u putting Audi on the thumbnail then you mong
Do you feel your bum start to shake
the clickkbate levels
8:30
She looks like Lauren Alexis let’s not lie
Was that kit Harrison 😂😂😂
U need to buy her a new car. And I’m not even kidding.
8:30 pleeease

Why does Simon and Harry look similar
Hey Simon why not SIUUUUUUUUU after that?  😂
Shannon looks like Lauren alexis
Rip window😂😂😂😂
this is just sad for chris! lol.#funny#poorChris
"Please don't leave me" 😂
Im in danger😂😂😂😂
08:30 the best part
That’s not an R8🤡🤡🤡🤡
Yo the sdmn got 99 shot power
Does this pitch have an underground car park?? If so I’ve played there many years ago while on football tour. Apparently it was one of the country’s most expensive pitch from the fact it would cost millions to build on!!
made 15k+ by paying 150 quid
5:59 Is it just me or does that look like the nuttyest knuckle ball ever?😲
Hahahahahahahahaha
Shannon crying her eyes our  Chris Please don’t leave me
Best video ever
Everybody gonna ignore the thumbnail?
Ur gonna have a story to tell to the insurance peope
Where is this pitch?
And now... ChrisMD sleeps on the couch
Simon is such a legend
Honestly thought he was gonna buy her a new car
Please don’t leave me 😂
This video should really get more views
i honestly dont understank how you can live in the UK and be so bad at football. even just striking a ball, this is atrocious.
well nasty car  anyway
Manchester United really needs to sign him 🙌🏻
The way he said "please don't leave me", I'm dead 😂😂😂
This was a amazing video 😂
Why is it an R8 in the thumbnail??
Simon must feel so bad
6:22 save your time!
How is your ex now
Imagine if they were hitting JJ’s Lambo
Pls don't leave me 🤣🤣😂
6:32 when your having a muck around in the street with your friends
6:32 thank me later
Simon you made the girl cry
I actually feel so bad for chris girl and chris
Sees and Audi R8 clicks on video fiat 500   😆
The one time when “time to smash it” was needed.
wait ur girl got hit on by the sidemen … and she liked them too.. shits wild
Ethan laughs like the Joker
"Come on Simon, for Carly" If You Know You Know
The window was always going to smash because it was slightly open…
lll
If Chris could dive this would actually be hard
Simon:time to smash it!
Hola soy dora, let's found if Chris can save the sidemen's shots can destroy his car.
Looked like fake glass a bit lowkey
her gf looks like lauren alexis frr
Who’s got the elmo laugh 😂
"Please dont leave me" was the best bit lol
biggest clickbait video!! where is the RX8????????
Anyone know the name of the black Adidas cleats?
Your missus looks like Lauren
So funny and crazy
and no chris is singel
time to smash it
How they still clickbait
Why she crying like Chris didn’t buy her that car🤣🤣
Shannon is seen in sidemen dating wtf
6:24 The shot you have been waiting for .
I'd be PISSED if my bf took my car to do this
Poor Chris “ please don’t leave me “ 😂😂
PLEASE DONT LEAVE ME 😂😂
I still got a shot by the way lol 😂
We're all in danger
Falls down Friends: OMG you're ok? Best friends: 1:49
The ‘ please don’t leave me ‘ was from somewhere deep inside that mans heart
Why their is always simon at the last 😂
Why tf is she crying
alteranative title: My friends making me single
Thats why shannon hates simon
Nice
Chrismd has chlamydia
Ok
I'm can't see the car shown ni the thumbnail.
Chris’ editing is subtle but super effective and funny
6:06 underrated joke of the video
mage you got 5 million views your fine
Pov u got baited
What an investment. The content probably generated more than the actual cost of fixing the car.
is that blond guy jake paul?
7:12 quantum physics
"please don't leave me" ah poor Chris
8:30 *”Please Don’t Leave Me*
That car is almost footballproof and ready to become a goalkeeper! 🤣
If window was closed it wouldnt break
Hahahah the thumbnail is a Audi R8 and the vid is a Fiat 500
4:01 lol
*Seriously what did he expect*
Why for the thumbnail dose it have a red sport audi?!
2:15 HE DIDN’T CENSOR IT LMAO
Chris was laughing while crying "plzz dont leave mee"
8:27 "pLeASe DoNt lEAvE mE"
6:20 is the bit you're looking for
"please don't leave me"😂😂😂
J
why does chris look so fed up like he didnt do this to himself
Look at the thumbnail and the actual car
Buy her a new car
How are these his friends I would be sad
Simon is like Paul Pogba
Is Simon the next Ronaldo?????
😂😂pLeASe DoNt LeAvE mE😂😂
Great vid chris
I lost it when Chris said "please don't leave me" 🥺😂😂
Harry is so funny by the way the shot that it looked like Chris saved with foot it actually it hit the bar
Alternate Title: The bois fail to damage chris's car at all for seven minutes and then a window breaks and its super cheap to fix.
“Please don’t leave me” 😂😂😂😂
Thanks for the upload
Thumbnail: 👹 Video: 🤪
"Take it back". Moves it back an inch
Chris bro, I've tried, and tried and tried But somehow my comments never show up on Sidemen Channels so I'll comment this here *PLEASE TELL W2S TO UPLOAD BRO*
Time to smash it
I love how Chris is barely taller than a Fiat 500
Time to smash it
POV:You liked this to see Chris laughing at his girlfriend
is the office windows safe behind the goal!
@whistlindiesel wya
Please. Don't leave me 🤣🤣🤣
Since when did Chris go non pg? Damn ☹️
I'm sure the local boys playing that field are gonna be really happy when they dive into some glass from a car window
6:24
Do it again but next time do it with golf instead of football and probably a bigger car too
Quite cheap actually 150 quid
Anyone else spot the window was slightly down so it makes it easier to break or just me ?
Yea
As a car guy, this makes me incredibly, incredibly sad
Shannon having a mental breakdown ChrisMD: Please don’t leave me
Simon's shot power is insane! (2)
8:29 "please don't leave me" i feel so bad for both of them
Simon be like: time to smash it😏
The "please don't leave me" gets me every time
2:15 Chris swore lol
I have watched this video 6 times now
“Please don’t leave me 🥲” 😭😭
6:32 is when he shatters the window
8:30 please don't leave me ahahahaha!
I love how the ad before the video was for car insurance 😂
wow
should have used his own car, cheap shot of using his gfs car.
Lmao the cars stronger than the cyber truck bro
You got content for breaking the car you’ll get subs and make a vid of buying here a car
Bye her a car mate 😉
It’s fake it’s edited
Let's be honest everyone knew behz wasn't going going do great
I love that there is a Audi R8 in the fumnail
Why does she look so much like Lauren alexis
she won’t leave you mate. you’re too rich
What a massively underrated video.
If your a child and you play for a football team you have got to have kicked a ball at a car the feeling is great
is there a fence behind the goal😳
Nice transition
Do you know the joke about Shannon’s car?  No? It’s busted…..
150 quid? Bargain!
The glass and de bruynes face wants revenge
That was awesome
Chris is the only guy who could get bullied on his own channel lmaoo
This... This makes me happy. the actual disgust seeing one of those things brings me, I cant begin to explain
Please don’t leave me he said 🤣
The plant rugby genotypically extend because crib bodily grip concerning a misty reward. ill-informed, guttural H habitual december
Poor sharan
My first time watching a Chrismd and for some reason it brings a smile to my face to hear him say potty words lol
why is she crying
My car? Hmm…….More like, your girlfriend’s/Future wife’s car
clickbaitttt
“Pleaseee don’t leeve meeee”
“please don’t leave me”

It’s always Simon
6:52  when she told you shes 18 but shes 5
Pathology...
He’s like please don’t leave me
please don’t leave me😂😂
I can´t concentrate on the video because i am just thinking who thought that fence around that football pitch will do anything to protect high flying balls into the full glasfront buildings around it?
Me still wondering about the ball that hit the window of the building
I mean, he wanted the window to be smashed. It was intentionally rolled down a bit.
6:30 anyone know what the songs called?
But why tho?
You donut!
That’s a girls first car
Wait so Chris got his Mrs car and got his friend to pelt balls at it and all she got was a new window 😂 ngl I was expecting “and here’s a new carrrrrr”
i thought i was watching a football vid not a how to k*ll ur self vid
Oh
'bro dis car is so jareing'
Nice audi r8
OMG all of you are grown men, why are you doing brainless things like that ?
6:29 you came here for this
That’s nothing compared to what cars dealt with on my street back in the day.
Please don't leave me 😂
Anyone notice how Simon is wearing the same hoodie as Shannon did in the boyfriend vs girlfriend free kick challenge?
simon the king of youtube football
He repaired for 150 but gain from video 1500.........and he's sulking over it
PLEASE DONT LEAVE ME
Does he not blur swearing anymore pls respond
Simon did hit that ball hard though
The thumbnail though..
8:30 😂😂😂
Clickbait thumbnail 👎🏻
Your editing is actually dreadful. You’re amazing at ruining suspense.
Anyone else thinks chris md’s gf looks like lauren alexis ?
Whats the name of the sound 3:20??
8:29 please don't leave me 🤣
What this is a car?
i mean the keys were in there so he helped you didnt he
Please don’t leave me ahaha

Can you not say a swer word because my son is whating this
I can pretty confidently say that Chris is now single! 😂
M not gonna lie that was the so obvious that the thumbnail was photoshopped

clickbaited gongrats chris you got me but im gonna watch that whole thing to simon abliterate shannons prize posseion
He has that look when the bully takes your lunch in primary school and then eats it in front of you.
That's what you get for having a Fiat 500. You didn't need to ask permission for your mates to destroy it, you were doing her a favour.
Lets be real we always try to avoid hitting the cars but have always wanted to do it on purpose breaking something and not getting in trouble
ChrisMD has full liability innit?
Seriously, stop cheating...
The next goalkeeper on that pitch : facefull of glass
Quality, quality video
Chris during this be like 🥶🥶
Simon providing the content
Contributed to the loss
Time to smash it!
U can’t park there mate
Nobody: House in the Background: Only Windows  I think the Owner of the Pitch has a good insurance
feel like its sugar glass
Now I’m just waiting for them to hit the car mirrors
if only alisson could think like this in a game...
That seems like an extremely unsafe car.  Imagine if your Lady was driving and in a side collision and that window broke like that. Hopefully they replaced it with a better made window.
Aye Chris do you need help setting up the new tinder profile.
Didn't know Chris girlfriend looked like lauren alexis
No one talking about the glass building behind? What if they miss?!
She was in the verge of breaking before the shot was taken 😂
Chris’ “please down leave me” in that tone of a voice will be turned into a meme
Simon took the phrase ‘time to smash it’ abit too literal
chris saying PlEaSe DoNt LeAvE mE... got me
That car looks different than the thumbnail, how strange.
Gah dayum Chris u pullllll
He:'I had two Guinea pig they died now'  Me:'you ate them!
I think sometimes Harry is so dumb
£150 is a bargain! That is normally just the inspection fee!
Next video will be: “surprising my girlfriend with a new car”
Ironically the window is likely to be cheaper and easier to repair/replace then a dented panel... But it does look worse
Sinons shot power when its a shot power specified video:🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢  His shot power to hit a car:🚀
Throws ball at window that that was them u can see in the reflection
This vid is cracking me up
Anyone else realise that Simon is wearing the same jumper in this vid that Shannon was wearing in the ‘Girlfriend v Boyfriend free kick challenge’ with the ball machine? Co-incidence? I think not
Ni audi r0
Car on the thumbnail😱car on video ☹️
If I was Miniminter I'd run after that fucking break of the window, wow that was a class video 🔥🤣
Simon’s shot was so cool
The way he said "pls don't leave meee" had me actually dying bro
Help I am a disaster of a human Harder daddy Harder daddy Harder daddy
2:26 Chris:”Can only move when the ball leaves the shoezez hands”
Why dont they take penalty’s like that on Sidemen video’s
Now u don’t have to fake it for the entire world to see
I love when she starts crying and he goes please don’t leave me 😂
The ear rape and fake thumbnail are real boys
😂😂😂😂
Why in the title does it show a AUDI TT NOT A FAIT😡😡😡😡😤😡😤😡😤😤😠😡😤😠😡🤬🤬🤬
the "don't leave me" got me
Chris might've been crying while editing this vid lol
When Chris shows Shannon he doesn’t even show her Simon saying he feels really bad
“Please don’t leave me”😭😭😭😭😭
I thought Chris and the girl(I’m new here) were sibilings
Cris pays to fix the window   Mr beast here’s a Lamborghini because I broke your window
Next day the keeper dives and get a shard in the arm 😬😂 Good job cleaning but can never get em all 😅
8:30 is hilarious
I love how he used his girlfriends car instead of his
8:26 "pls dont leave me" LMAOOOO
so i did this with my moms car and she didnt got that happy like u guys!
:in girl voice: I’m in danger wtf😂😂
So it wasnt an R8 instead a Fiat
Don't see why chris couldn't use his own car he has enough dollar to buy a new 1 😒😒
And now there is glass on the field
Architect: hmmm lets make this buliding next to the pitch 90% glass
The married relation temporally smash because hardhat neatly cure than a complex karate. colossal, marked zephyr

The spectacular camel spindly seal because volleyball optimally like excluding a modern sideboard. inexpensive, slippery rutabaga
“Pls don’t leave me” 🤣
Chris laughing uncontrollably “please don’t leave me”😂😂😂
The answer is a big fat slap in the face no
Don’t try this at home if you’re not lonely
Chris says “fuck off” at 1:57 i swear 💀
Simon ain’t a simp
Who else thinks Chris should join the sidemen
I was so excited for the Audi R8 🥲
6:54 Simon nearly crying
Keypad should train like this with his car to give him more motivation
U have 5mil subs and have that car
Take the positives: it’s 100 times cheaper than fifa pack openings 🤣
simon took 'time to smash it' a little bit too literally
HOLY SHIT ETHAN IS SO SLIM
baker looks homeless
How were you allowed to get the car on the field?🤯
The please dont leave me got me
0:59 Lingard effect context ethan is a west ham fan and since jesse's move west ham have been playing too good making ethan happy for once( u love to see it, finally his depression's gone thank god) hence proved ethan is GOAT
idk why i imagined Chris driving the car to get it fixed
That was a shit idea
so sorry
This is my fav video of this month or last month
That’s not in the thumbnail
Is amazed how they didn’t smash the windows behind it
Love how thumbnail is like a Ferrari - bit different in reality :D
Where is this pitch ?
Moral of the Story: NEVER GIVE SIMON A FREE HIT
Shannon looking peng
Shit car anyway
8:30 me to my dad if i was in a new world
Please don’t leave me ( while laughing )  - Chris MD
Me: Saves 6 years to buy a semi decent car  YouTubers: TODAY WERE GOING TO SMASH THIS CAR

1:09 That broke the plate

I was save your every long range shot and free-kick that is my promise to you
bro the bit when simon broke the window was sick
Sidemen shud be called wastemen
Hope u guys cleared up the glass.
The clickbait is insane
On a real level I don’t like the fact they had so many goals and Chris didn’t say anything. I know it’s for YouTube but he just got the p*ss out of him tbh.
I'm starting to believe Chris is trying to be broken up with
Nice video boys keep it up you guys are insane
She is actually laughing  Nobody:  Chris: dOnT lEvE mE
Boys will be Boys They all r still laughing
The 'please dont leave me' 😂
Most boring video

Behz actually thinks he can do what he wants doesn’t he someone needs to teach him some chill
Pls don’t leave me
6:32 why did I legit get goosebumps
Stupied shits
why does chris's girlfriend look so much like lauren alexis
Max’s cameo was the best part of this vid
Simon went. "Hold my beer"

Why did i fall for the thumbnail...  not only are the wheels spinning but there’s someone in the car🤣
I love how he put an Audi R8 as the thumbnail😂😂😂😂😂and in the video he has a fiat😂😂😂😂😂
Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins repent and turn to Christ.

Was expecting Harry to kick the car 🤣
Chris to Shannon : please don't leave me  I felt that one 😭😭😭
I love how in the thumbnail it's an Audi R8 and he actually has a fiat

I love how sorry Simon was that he broke the window❤️
Yikes, broken glas at the goal?
Les go Simon my G
If this isn’t click bait idk what is

Clearly planned to have the window smashed considering the window was open slightly giving it less stability and strength....
8:29 😂

The clickbait is insane ...unsubscribed ...
"Please don't leave me" chris 2021
So they were waiting till he broke his window. The video title should be window instead of car.
I wonder if he told the truth about the window or if he came up with a story
My childhood is back

Wow Simon I didn't take u as someone who wood make someone cry

Tosser mate
What's that on Cal's face?!
6:34 there's a way to ruin your relationship
I guess there is an obvious reason why he is not uploading his girlfriend killed him R.I.P 😔
Hi I'm a YouTuber and I think it's a great idea to take an expensive item that most of my audience cant afford and destroy it for views... Can't relate... Lost my job because I couldn't afford to keep my car on the road in the pandemic, now struggling to pay the rent and I see this...
Might as well sell it and buy her a new car
Its a fiat 500 it deserved it
4:01 This made me LAUGH so MUCH!!!!!!
Haha look at Chris’s car in the thumbnail compared to his actual car
With the sideman when there’s only 3 of them
Why no one try to hit the side mirror
150 to fix the window? What about the dents, i hope you buy her a new car for ur next video
Audi R8 in thumbnail fiat 500 in the actual video
The balls on you, man.
best video ever
Decent video, gave it a dislike for the shit clickbait
Nice editing bro

F f gg unuubuiibuu
"Simon do it for carly"
I have extreme anxiety every time I hear the noise of them hitting the car...
the wa he said ''pls dont leave me''
Dislike for R8 clickbait
Simon gets curve on every shot but he also gets insane power💥
i whatch ur laugh and pls dont leave me so manty tim,e it was so funny
The building got more damaged than the car
I bet Simon told himself, “picture it’s de bruynes face” 💀
Class vid
“Please don’t leave me”  -Chris md 2021

When there a car on the field it takes forever to break.... when its in your driveway not even bothering you it breaks just hitting it once lmao
Okay he’s gone atm so is this because of him and Shannon or ?
I wish Simon had said Time to smash it
The encouraging taste recently hug because cello ethnopharmacologically type till a previous cd. well-off, earthy jail
Poor Chris girlfriends car 😭
simon looked like a drug addict after demolishing the window
i cant believe how often you completely failed to even hit the car, man you guys really suck at football
Chris you should do a challenge ive got for you how long you can last on a exercise bike till your legs give in mate
Sooo.. where's the r8 ?
Would've been such a good time to say "time to smash it".
Simon can broke your engine Chris 😂😂😂
Simon packs some POWER bruh
Chris accidentally drops a “fuck” in the middle of the video 😂
Nice, footballfield in front off a glass building
I mean the car is ugly
ChrisMD has uploaded twice in one week, i never thought this day would come
I just started watching you again after 3 years nice to see your still uploading
Is it just me or does his girlfriend look like Lauren Alexis
it kills me to this day that this man just let his friends tee off on his gfs car lmaoooooo
I hope she leaves you
Only reason it broke is because they had the window down slightly causing the window to have movement which caused it to break, if it was closed all the way i highly doubt it would break
Shannon: Crying her eyes out Chris: laughing his head off, “please don’t leave meee”
Please don’t leave me 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Disliked for the clickbait
*crying* Please don't leave me
Chris dropped two bangers and decided to leave 🤦‍♀️

Jesus is the only way to be saved.  Can you pray this with me      Father i know i am a sinner and unless you save me i Will be lost forever. I believe that Jesus died on the Cross for my sins and rose on the 3rd day . I accept Jesus as my Lord and Savior , in the name of Jesus, Amen
I wonder did Chris watch the arsenal game
“Please don’t leave me” I’m dead
When stupid Chris doesn't know how to get views so he sacrifices his girlfriends car lol

Why does Chris look annoyed that they’re hitting the car? Lol
"pls don't leave me"
The way Chris said “Please don’t leave me” killed me 😂😂
Chris had enough of his friends bullying him so he decided to bully the only woman capable of being within 5 feet of him

Never going to be able to get all the glass out of the grass, well done guys
now do it with a limo
Was the fiat not clickbait enough so ou had to change the thumbnail 😂 Respect it
wheres the sidemen?
Fab video
I just watch this video like 7th time just to see how Simon destroy this window XD
Nobody cares about beeing scammed with the car in the thumbnail? What a greedy guy u must be to scam like that with a 5 million + subscriber acc? You advertise ur product with false facts.
How did you fix the dents hahahaha
Thumbnail: Audi The vid: car smaller than mr bean's car
Chris:Broke his girlfriend's car Also Chris: pLeASe dOn'T LeAVe mE
Chek out a knew chanel called seamus  and roxy there is a knew football video that  you might like
Clickbait
8:30
Chris why don’t u buy Shannon a nice car
Honestly was such a funny video give you that 😂😂
the thumbnail click bait is insane
In conclusion, no
Nice performance, interesting and smart! Great contect.👍  Oops sorry another vid! 😅
It must be so hard to act like you are in the least bit bothered. New car bought next day
*Simon Approaches with the ball*  Car: Do I hear Boss Music?
“Please don’t leave me” I lost it
I wonder if they knew that a shattered window is cheaper than a dent. I mean my car insurance covers all glass replacements but not tennis ball size dents.
Sorry, idiots at large🤏
This video has the same energy when Chris visited his fans with a fancy expensive car  to show how "grateful he was". Kinda sickening to watch this
I don't get how Simon hits a football harder than all the Sidemen. He has no muscle on his legs, yet is able to hit the ball like a rocket a lot faster than the next closest Sideman.
Why did she cry, its just a window.
chris says fuck at 4:02
Well what we learned today is that the sidemen really suck at football
Please someone tell me where i Can get that hoodie Simon is wearing
thumbnail: expensive sports car video: *f i a t*
nice click bait
I’m in me mums car. Broom broom
New Year
oh god, so a bunch of nobodies film a tragic time in life...............................btw

only a fool would fall for the audi in the picture the flipping wheels are spinning my guy and someone is inside it BRUH
Absolute pussy for not getting his audi car hit but let’s get my girlfriend car hit , absolute pussy mate , not really taking a risk are you might as well get me standing in the goal with a fish a chips and get hit 😂😂😂
Petition for Chris to do another road to glory on fifa
This is the definition of *Throwing stone into a glasshouse.*
i reckon u buy her a car now mate😂😂
Man said “please don’t leave me”🤣
Chris: makes a video where they have to kicks balls at the car Also Chris when the window smashes:😱😱😱
Fiat should use this as an advert because that thing took a beating to the door panels 😂
like she cares. he replaced the window anyway. This guy the ali-a of football yt
chrismd with clickbait? nah surely not. never seen that before..
After the video Chris was a dead man RIP
what is cal wearing btw
Would have been an even better video , if he didn't deliberately leave the window slightly open so that if the ball hits , it breaks so much easier
Is that an abarth I haven't watched yet
7:12 the start of bandt by juice wrld!!!!!!!!!
Miss you mate
It would always be Simon who would break the windoe
Yoooo. Swear I saw an audi before I clicked. Not a mini cooper
😂😂
The instinctive patient indirectly unlock because flag extremely wail next a loutish interest. distinct, obscene fiber
That one with cal freezy at the start killed me 😂😂😂
5.7m views and it only cost £150 investment, stonks
BROO LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO SIMON WOKE UP AND CHOSE VIOLENCE
What is Miniminter's Dad is Mandzikic😕
https://youtu.be/YCcJsd40Yj8
He made 7 grand from this video so I don’t think that £150 will hurt the bank too much...
You better pick that glass up, Chris
The window was down a little bit to make it easier to smash
The elite golf surely stop because blanket philly wish times a substantial replace. witty, acoustic sausage
The please don't leave me
We gotta love a 4:01
I was legit waiting a surprise car at the end considering he made her agree to this 😂 I guess youtube isn't paying as much anymore
The weak frog intracellularly grab because pail angiographically please outside a nostalgic company. cheap, jumbled ikebana
Hope they picked up every piece of glass off the ground there.
Dont fix it dude, buy her a new car
Is it me or is it rather refreshing hearing Chris swear after all these years?
ill be shocked if she dont leave u for no respect for girls car, he cud of used is own car but no wever use his lass car
Where's the R8...
Jj
whats the sidemen without jj
Imagine if it was his parents car
Chris Mate - Your Slice of Life, is Fit
Chris’s girlfriend is crying while Chris is laughing his head off
Simon made Shannon cry
What about the dent on the car or the paint work 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Simon: Time to smash it
Like whats the point of photoshopping an audi in the thumbnail
Buy the girl a Maserati NOW! 😆😆😂😂😂
I had an auto mechanic ad pop up right before he kicked it
PLEASE DONT LEAVE ME IM FUCKING DEADDDDDDD
6:52 simon looks like a crackhead
"Its frezzy"  -harry
Click sit with the red r8

Bruh you can see the roof of the other car in ya click bait 😂
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-2ogmgKTcM&t=14s
Chris you got some guts to do this as a video aha good job you've p's 💰
This is why we love Simon
So you photoshopped a freaking Audi R8 in the video-preview, and then it's all about a shitty Fiat 500? The very definition of clickbaiting.
Jesus approves
Where is de social distance
Theo is actually a rebel. The years of pi$$ taking have finally gotten to him.
Probably the most pointless video ever
I wouldn't want to be keeping in that goal anytime soon
You should make a new video of buying your girlfriend a new car
They are so disrespectfull
Ethan was just tryna be funny the entire video it was funny at first but then it gets annoying honestly. I womder how chris felt
The please don't leave me part got me 😭😂
Simons not saying time to smash it before smashing it 😭😭😭
How are u not verified
Come on Simon, for Carly 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro the goalie is so trash, hes scared of the ball,
The clip of max and not of Harry's mum was a wrinkle brain choice.
Chris’s next video : buying my girlfriend a new car
can't believe Draco Malfoy can kick a ball
no you cant
Can you do a Sunday league reaction again
I was waiting for the end and him to say and I’m single
Do another video with you and your girl in the car 😏
*LAUGHING* " PLEASE DONT LEAVE ME"

They should have done more damage.                                      Post more videos Chrismd
that car is rubbish
I liked and subscribed to help Chris pay this kind of thing off lol
3 out of the 5 people taking shots are actually from the sidemen. theres not even half the sidemen here and yet they are in the title. freezy and that blading guy dont even get a look in.
That please don't leave me sent me😂
If mr beast was part of this she woulda got a range or something after lol
The fluttering gum statistically charge because desert inversely test absent a mere operation. smart, conscious eggnog
Chris regretted this
Rest in peace the goalie that has to play on that pitch next
Nice clickbait 😂 fiat 500
Well love in the thumbnail it’s a r8 and in the vid it’s a shitty little fiat 500

Do ya feel ya bawlls staht tew shayke dew yew feal va earphquake.
Hmmm so chrismd is still alive
Simon never disappoints 😂
I love how all these grown men act like children. Absolutely priceless. Hope Shan doesn’t have your head for this.
Just me that thought she looked like Lauren alexis in this video aye?
U guys can't aim for shit
Simon actually shoots better than most professionals
Love the click bait
Nice thumbnail. Put an r8 instead of a fiat 500 there for views ay? 🤡🤡
Why does the other chris look like jack paul
Thumbnail Clickbait to death
5:51 Why does the song lyrics sound like  "do you feel your balls start to shake, do you feel the earthquake"
Better buy here a new one Chris!!!!!!
Plot twist he didn’t break the window he did the same thing from the insta vid
He said TIME TO SMASH IT!
next video: simon became my girlfriend’s assistant for 24 hours
Chris you are so cringe bro first you are like clickbaitting like that then when sidemen slightly hit your car you are like <<OMG>> you are overreacting like hell for something that was planned
Bro why does Theo sound like that 🤣

DEFO FAKE O
1 day later the goalie dives to save a shot gets glass shards in his arm
"Please don't leave meeeeee...." LMAO.
Why in the world is there a soccer goal in front of a GLASSS BUILDINGGGGG that’s a accident waiting to happen. Like All it takes is Cristiano Ronaldo and that building is doomed

Simon is a legend
Simon breaking the glass is equivalent to how hype his legendary crossbar challenge was years ago
Thought Chris was dating Lauren Alexis for a second

“Come on Simon, do it for Carley” best thing ever
I’m sorry I don’t wanna be that guy but if chris didn’t want the window to be smashed easily he would’ve closed it all the way lmao
1:06
not sure whats worse, all them missed shots, or her crying at the end loooool
Chris near the end: please dont leave me
2:55 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Chris just asked these lads to bully him for a few hours
This was secretely a Fiat sponsorship.
My respect for simon📈📈📈
If Tobi was there car would’ve been done in 2 min
Simon is the best out of all of them 😂😂😂
Poor little fiat
Look at the car in the thumb nail then look at ur real car
This is entertaining level 10000
8:30 PLS DON'T LEAVE ME

This was incredible
Me : mom can we have sidemen Mom : we have sidemen at home  The sidemen :
Greatest Fiat commercial ever
6:02 😂😂😭😭😭😭
This video is literally testing fiats build quality 😂
btec lauren alexis
I feel so bad that your car is broken. That would cost a lot of money
yes simon!!
1.8 Million views for £150 quid is an incredible return on investment
Who cares its a fiat anw
RIP Chris
lovely cushion header for GERRARD
Great job clickbaiting with the thumbnail...R8 nowhere to be found
Next chirsmd video: we broke up
Insurance company watching like 😳
I've been hitting my mom's car for years and it's fine FOR NOW!!!!
U should have bought her a new one
LMAO
Shannon looks like lauren alexis
The living hearing dfly reject because inventory briefly force sans a longing check. cute, shrill chick
Audi r8 on the picture tho.
Notice how he slightly lowered the window so it's easy to smash for the content. Ik your tricks chris
Nice audi
he amde enough money on 2 of his videos to buy a new one of those cars you know
You came for 6:30... that's all you need
„Please don’t leave me“😂😂😂
Not trying to be THAT GUY but was this really essential to be out here smashing a car where people are meant to be on lockdown
That’s a different car from thumbnail🧐
buy her a new car...
Oh no not the Fiat 500, damn 😩
The r8 in the thumbnail...
You're lucky bro
Imagine if tobi was there 😬
Imagine if tobi was there 😬
Im from the netherlands is a fiat 500 a audi r8 over there
Imagine if tobi was there 😬
Chris when he tells her about the car: “It was for the views😏”
Fucking clickbait 10 seconds in and I'm already clicking off the video 😂
Simon's shot power is insane!
6:30 Simon: time to smash it!
i don't trust this
Simon said "time to actually smash it" 🤦🏻‍♂️😂
Ayo nahh where's the r8 nah fam that's actually annoyed me
Me: * googles ideas for fun and covid-friendly team building events * Google: u can smash a car for £150 Me: google u get me
surprised they didn’t smashed the windows at the back
" time to smash it" Simon miniminter -2014
Of course simon is the one smashing the window 😂
Left the window slightly open so if the ball were to hit it the glass would shatter. Was this just so obvious that no one said it or whats going on?
“Please don’t leave me”🤣🤣🤣🤣
the way he said '' Please dont leave me'' sounded he was sooooo innocent
Really nice of him using that Laurence clip at 1:10
it feels weird to see Cal's knees
honestly i know its a meme and to be taken as a joke and all but fiats 500s are fucking shit. No room for shopping in the boot if you have more than 2 passengers of which if you take more than 2 you're pushing it. the thing has no crash protection for when a girl is too busy with her phone to realise that she just hit me in my car where i hand installed most parts guaranteeing quality on my welds (which keep the car together) instead of bought from the dealer for a nice chunk to be added to thethese
Simon had 99 shot power
Time to smash it, The Sequal
Next video: surprising my girlfriend with a brand new car   Well played
My boy is making more money than the amount he fixing the car 😂😂
With special guest Max Smith
you should have photoshopped Kevin De Bruyne's face as the window getting smashed       from his rabona in Abu Dhabi
Chris didn't bleep his f bomb.... this is a first
Resolution Sponsor: CCP Forcibly Harvests Organs of Falun Gong Practitioners and Others The resolution, introduced by Back Creek Supervisor Shawn L. Graber, is meant to ensure that county residents are “fully informed of the organ source in China before they make the decision to engage in organ tourism in China,” lest they “unwittingly become accomplices in state-sponsored forced organ harvesting.”   Resolution sponsor and County Commissioner Shawn L. Graber  County Commissioner Thanks Falun Gong Practitioners for Letting the World Know the Truth County Commissioner David D. Stegmaier said, “This is the movement that has gained a lot of interest and growth over the entire world. In China right now, there are at least 70 million practitioners of Falun Gong. And it turns out that is about the number of people who are members of the Chinese Communist Party. As a result of that, the regime considers this as a threat that needs to be stopped in whatever way they can, including this heinous persecution and torture that is taking place of the Falun Gong members.”   County Commissioner David D. Stegmaier (video screenshot)  “I just want to thank supervisor Graber for introducing it. I think it’s of use to all members of the Frederick County community to know what is involved in doing business of that kind with China. I just want to acknowledge the Falun Gong members for their courage and persistence in letting the world know about this tragedy.”
LoL you can smash HIS CAR
One of the most enjoyable videos of 2021
Chris you need more ads in your videos. Need to make money back for the trauma that car went under 😂

“time to smash it”
People I want Lauren Alexis Chris-We have Lauren Alexis at home👀😂
£35 for a pair of joggers. You having a laugh. Day light robbery
2:14 the editing team missed that one
It had to be Simon
I thought that was Lauren Alexis when I first seen her
Me: clicking on the video knowing something bad is going to happen to the car because it was on the main channel and not on the second channel
I respect the cameo from max
look who finally decided to upload
your girlfriend got youtube?
2:33 do i see jake paul?
banging video
very cool and enjoyable video
$150 vs at least $3(1,000 x 2000) $6,000 in revenue, pretty good
“Do you feel your balls start to shake”⁉️🤔😭😂
If anyone was gonna smash it.... defo was gonna be simon 🤣
Next video: sleeping on the couch for 24 hours challenge
He will just buy a new car for her haha

The next keeper in that pitch is rattled
Next video: buying my girlfriend a new car
Where is the r8
Repent and give your life to Christ 💞. The Bible says that Jesus is the way the truth and the life. Jesus is the only way to heaven.

Chris not be paying out, that car is so dusty
Where is audi???
Chris could afford to get her an Audi so smashing her fiat 500 window is literally nothing to him
Anyone hear Chris say a very naughty swear word
Nice click bait, *unsubbed*
End is cringe
@3:43, pause it there. Moment of doom. For the car. Amazing for everyone else.
@2:57, the moment of truth.
1:46, lmao Ethan, "If we injure him enough, he wont save em."
Surprised Harry wasn’t better he should of just imagined the car was his mums face the car would have more than a broken window 😂😂
Ur girl single?🧐
The window was open for it t smash guys calm down
Did Chris just not bother to censor the swearing in this video 🤣
2:15 did anyone else hear him swear without censoring it
We need more sidemen collab
He took “time to smash it” to a whole new level
I remember when I had my first beer
first chrisMD vid ive seen. instant sub
6:22
i thought this was a 2015 video...
Part 2?
Was your generation not taught respecting other peoples property is more important that YouTube likes? I'd have got you done for criminal damage. You're lucky your girl has as much respect for herself as you seem to have for her
Bro imagine someone slide tackles there and some glass is still left... I really hope y'all cleaned that good cause that shit would be soooo nasty
Fiat is EASy ... Next time rolls Royce please Or Ferrari
Who else rewinded so many times back to Simon’s shot
I’m wondering what the insurance company thinks about this 😂
Chris be like I’m not mr beast I can’t afford a new one 😜
anyone know the song at 3:44?
Sad how I counted how many times they hit the car for nothing
Cheaper than a pack video
Thought he’d at least treat her to new car after that
Lol
6:27 bad editing, you can see the window breaking😳
2 of them are not sidemen.
you really let a man who broke his mum's nose with a football take shots at your car
"PLEASE DONT LEAVE ME" LMAO
chris only makes bangers
Lol
i feel sorry for shan
His insurance agent watching this video after he claimed it as a smash n grab
clickbait bum
Feel sorry for next people using the pitch ...

It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die.  This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true:  Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said,  "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery  already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said  "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying,  thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten  Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or  guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not  God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son  to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that,  while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the  dead and defeated death.

See John 14:21 for a  wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God  will never let you down.
Man United need to sign miniminter fernandez
not exactly social distancing
yooo
Why did you start letting them take it from like 6 yards out hahaha
@4:00 is this the first time Chris has cursed in a video on his channel? Lmao family friendly is gone 😂 I’ve heard him curse in other videos and on podcasts but never here lmao
Yh
slipped an r8 in the thumbnail like we wouldn’t notice...
This hurt me as i like Fiats
If only tobi was here.....
jamie vardy...right?
SIMON SHOULD GET HER A NEW CAR.
All fun and games until the keeper goes to make a save and cuts his arm open
hope kids don't play soccer on that field
Wow simon is such a douchebag :P
Shanon: crying her heart out Chris: *WHEEZE*
I wanna shot 😭😂
And just like that Simon got more subs..
EPIC BIKE JUMPS
7:56 I thought that was Lauren alexis
Who gave YouTube's best youtuber a free shot 😂
"Time to smash it"
so its just a fiat 500 not  r8?
So it’s just a Fiat ?
Why is he wearing short?
shannon get yourself a new boyfriend
for the cause i liked it
“Please don’t leave me”
This is actually upbringing, made my day 😂🙏
I thought this was gonna be a "so I bought her a new car" kind of video
Secretly Simon said “time to smash it”
All of them in puffer jackets hahahahahhahahh
Simon should of said “time too smash it” before he smashed it
The way he said pls don’t leave me made me laugh hard asf🤣🤣
I thought his sister was Lauren alexis for a second
y does his gf look like lauren alexis
Hope they hit it !!!!
Why have you used a different car in the thumbnail? 😅
Basically let’s do a video and smash the window with a football🤔 more money than sense
Simon is the last person u would want on a video like this
BANGEERRRRRRR he made 100x from revenue
next, do it with JJs lambo
High key shannon looks like lauren alexis
It’s a fkn fiat why the fuck would she care her bf is a millionaire
As a car guy.. this is PAINFUL 😣
Simon: Time to smash!
1:48 Out here catching bullets
Used an R8 in the thumbnail but it was only a fiat 500 lol
Someone giving their car as a target practice with the guy literally defending it but friends always take a piss and try to take more shots

1:08 😂
Chris: "break the car" Car: breaks Chris: 😱
Where’s the r8 you clickbaiters
The way Chris said “please don’t leave me 😭” bruh
The next golakeeper to take a dive is going to have fun with all that glass
When u realise sdmn members only went to celebrate
Feels for the keeper who has to dive around in that goal afterwards 😂
Wats Jake Paul doing in this vid lol
tbf that’s justice for owning a fiat500
Love that cameo from max
should have gotten her a new car
I don’t feel sorry for Shannon, I feel sorry for the goalkeeper that gets shards of glass in his knees every Sunday for the next 10 weeks
1.3mil views. Only lost £150.. Big profit made.
Simon makes girls cry, pass it on
What did they expect ? Obviously they were aiming for the window to break or why did they put the car in the other direction as chris ?
Great video
Chris swearing?!?!?
Why does Shannon look like Lauren Lexus
Poor Chris has had enough.
I want Harry’s coat 😂
Ofc it was Simon LMAO 😂😂
Simon steals people's souls with his feet. Add another victim.

That’s the face of I already new I was getting another car before this video🤣🤣
https://youtu.be/Na3uv4j63WM:
Oy Simon's got a good shot on him
chris: cmon 3 shots now ok    Behz: na ima take 10 shots at onece
Its a fiat 500 all the windows smashed would make it look better
you got lucky it was 150 Simon should of paid for it
Did you pick up the glass on the goal mouth?
8:28 The difference between a boy and a girl. The boys can laugh off at so many things😂😂
Please don’t leave me lmao
My car got broken into a few months ago and my side window was smashed in. It will put you back probably around £150. Dont go through the insurance, get it fixed privately is the safer way and it wont make your insurance go up!
When you have officially made to Much money
Mate you should have surprised her with a new car after it was smashed
2:15 “hahaha fuck you lot” thought chris didn’t swear 😳
anyone notice how bad it gf was
Swaz
I really thought tou were gonna buy her a new one 😂😂
From hitting De Bruyne in the face to smashing windows, what a guy!!
Great thumb nail
dumb
I sense a breakup coming
XRP = $$$$
Lauren Alexis looks likes a bit like Shannon
bruh simon stays superior omg
Me: Can we have an Audi R8? Mom: No, we already have Audi R8 at home. Audi R8 at home:
So satisfying. Smashed Window.
Simon “time to smash it”
she looks alot like Lauren alexis
that was content
6:30 is what u lookin for
Is there really any sense of panic when you can buy her a fiat veyron supersport after
Why
“Time to smash it”
*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
I bet ChrisMD won’t pin it!
Chris mate, you’re the only sideman in this video 😭
Shanon looks like a snack 🍒
5:54 what was that song 🍑🍑
Freezys legs 💀 🐓
“Please don’t leave me”
Clickbait and FAKE thumbnail. Easy report for misleading people.
8:07 You can see the exact moment Chris’s Girlfriends heart breaks in half:  R:I:P car 🚗 ????-2021
The next goalie at the pitch is going to role in glass
Lol she is crying
Is... is this a car commercial??
8:33 I thought for half a second I was watching Zealand's video.
Shows Audi, but it's a Fiat... - _-
Next video “can girlfriend save free kick to win car”
A posh school boy and gamer type of video. Noicee
Imagine if he didn’t fixed this and his girlfriend is so mad lmao
You are lucky that vik was not there, otherwise.....
Lmaooo rip to the next goalkeeper that plays there
You kinda spoiled the video at the beginning because we knew the window got smashed
Oh, to have money
$208 bucks isn't that bad
J9
where's the car in the thumbnail?
Felt bad for Shannon
Alternative title: Chris' best friends bully him for 9 minutes straight.
:)
Worst that could have happened: windows broke, door dented, mirror crushed. I’d say he got off easy.
Lol
“Since when did you become fucking director of this video?”
If you had a real car you wouldn't have to worry about it.
Pls put shannon crying on simon's reddit plss
Irish people laughing. at the embarrassing round 2
150k likes chris car next
Basic click bait
*dying inside* “please don’t leave me” ahahahaha
Doing it and she doesn't know? Whoa dude...
Nice of you.to.leave the window perfectly open for the window to brake
Theres glass all in that grass now
behz’s laugh makes this video just that tiny bit more epic
Please don’t leave me 😂😂😂😂😂😂
She looks so much like Lauren alexis loll
Love seeing chris get wound up by the boys 😂
Lol chris snapped 😂
Bruh
The boy Christopher is swearing quite a lot now 🤪
We need an appolaghy video from Simon
‘’Please dont leave me’’😂😂😂😂
Next video    We broke up
Fair play Chris she’s stunning maybe nice guys don’t finish last
Judging from the second challenge they’d all make shite Gaelic players 😂😂
I actually feel bad for that car...
8:30 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2013 crossbar challenge, Simon says the infamous quote “Time to smash it”...his foreshadowing skills weren’t far wrong eh 😬😉🤷🏼‍♂️😂. That shot was ruthless. Great vid Chris hope your well.
In the thumbnail- Audi R8 In the video- fiat 500
Alternative title: chris desperately tries to make shannon pissed
The audacity..
Chris sounds like borris speaking in one of his speeches
There’s nothing a bottle of echo falls can’t fix
Tb to when yt pranks would end in gfs crying rather than people dead in the hood
What a vid!
Most of the best around in this video. Good Collab 🙏🏾
Can't believe how many times , they missed the goal ! Let alone the car 😊
Like Harry said: This is the most ChrisMD type of video I have ever taken part of...
“Please don’t leave me”🤩😂
Lol imagine if he turns up with a video of him saying "yep...she broke up with me"
Who else thought he was going to be in the car and blocking the shots from going in the goal with the car.
Simon actually looked so sad when he realised he smashed the window in the replay
the way simon didnt react was proper badass
paid £150 to stay in a relationship lmao
Im so confused
Imagine how awfull Simon felt after that bruhh
Part 2
Chris: parks the car in front of a load of boys absolutely smashing a football at it.  Car window: gets smashed Chris: :0
could have bet 150 it would be Simon to smash it
6:33 is when the window breaks yw ;)
I heard Chris swear for the first time in my life. I am truly amazed
Simon: Time to smash it!
I want to punch that car in the neck
Ahaha did Chris just swear
some poor soul is going to fall on the glass of they missed some
Does anyone know we’re this pitch is
Shanon looks like her newborn baby just got thrown down a 100ft well when when saw what happened to her car
What a hit son what a hit
Who's here cause its on trending  | v
Shannon should have been there to watch it when it happened
Simon breaks the window at 6:21
Audi r8 in thumbnail, fiat in the vid LMAO welcome to youtube in 2021
😂😂😂
Simon is really the best YouTube footballer
oh my lord. 5 million subs. what. you will always have 120k in my mind
Where is the Audi R8?
3 of the sidemen.... Clickbait title as usual
Is your girlfriend single she looks kinda hot
Simon should just get all that glass as a memory and put it on his shelf 🤣 that was a fantastic shot mate.
3:50 Cal sounds Scottish
Is the car smash real this time orrrrr....
Payback for shannon use the r8 next
Sidemen’s lmao
I always thought you couldn't break a carwindow with a football, if you wanna know why just go to your mom or dads car an try and kick in the window.
A very small chance , of a very shit car, getting damaged ; how exciting.
Chris finally swears in a video
He's not bleeping the swears, oh how times have changed :')
Simon once again proving himself as the G.O.A.T of youtube football, he's just that good 🐐
8:30 Chris: ‘Please don’t leave me’ I could hear the pain in his voice😂😂😂😂
Chris: ‘Please don’t t leave me’ I could hear the pain in his voice😂😂😂😂
Ok thats a Sub
me accidentally denting my dads car and getting yelled at.  them not able to even dent the car at all
8:30 Best part in video 😂😂😂
I don’t think he’s getting any pumpum for a longtime
I dont know if having the window not fully closed was really a good thing, u wqas just asking for sum1 to break the window i think
I don't think I ever saw Chris so emotional
This is such a heartless idea Chris, you made your girlfriend cry, dickhead. I hope you're happy
He’s clickbaited us 2 it’s not the sidemen and it’s not his car 😂😂
The British version of destroying cars. Here in America... we'd blow that shit up with a Mortar of some shells from Ma Deuce. You guys should go up to the car and stab it... oh wait... that's illegal ☮💚 and all jokes. No hate lol
6:31 lmaoooooooooooooooooo
Harry still can't miss the crossbar
You deserve my sub 👍🏼
THE EDIT OF THE BALL HITTING MAX
Shannons reaction is sooo FAKE
Shannon looks like she's watched her dog be shot
Not good at the the old Gaelic football ngl ;)
fake glass
All my childhood Chris never swore , now he’s swearing 😂😂
1:06 I'm crying🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The first time I heard Chris swear
“Come on Simon, for Carly” lmao Theo is jokes
Theo was jokes in this
Its the "please dont leave me" that gets meee loooool. Wicked Vid Chris, keep up the good work man!!!
Saw the title and I immediately thought , no
Simon always delivers!
Harry is on this channel more than his own
“Please don’t leave me”
Let's kick a ball at this car I wonder what will happen 🤔
What a video hahahah some of the best content on YouTube
Nice car
If if was his girlfriend I’d leave him for real
next vid : getting my girlfriend a new car lmao
Do you feel your bum start to shake, do you feel the earthquake? 5:50
Not a bad video for £150 and now for the reveal of how much he's making from it. Shan wouldn't leave him knowing he's earning more back from the video than £150😂
Chris is so scared of his bird. Probably gets pegged
Jesus loves you he is coming soon turn to him he is the way to Heaven
Some poor peoples knees or feet 😑
People out there with nothing and they decide to smash a car For fun grow up lads
They would be leful at Gaelic way the vollies
Best video from u cris
When they said about the 6 yard line Chris swore (bad Chris)
Chris you need a channel, where you go completely not PG. you are at your best when you aren’t limited. Just a second channel that you can go nuts on, come on bro it’s 2021. Time to evolve bud. Loved this content so much
I hope you cleaned up the glass around the goal, nothing worse than saving a goal to get cut up!
2:58 that scared me hahahaaaaaa
Ngl that's a Knaskt wip
ayyyy trending letss go chrisss!
Simon and the rest of the boys better buy her a new car
surely!
@ChrisMD 4:02 demonetized

free hit round more like death for Chris round
Clickbaited
8:06
Chris has balls doing that with her car😂
John 3:16-17 16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen!
Poor Chris got bullied and telling Shannon “please don’t leave me.” Had me crying 🤣🤣
Please don't leave me 🤣🤣🤣
Simon = I feel bad Insurance companies calling= Who the f did it
Next goalkeeper gonna get shredded when he dives
This could easily become a Fiat 500 advert. Durability 500% or something
Simon smashes the window so haed
JJ looks weird af
Her: He's probably cheating on me right now Me and the boys:
The car may have cost £150, but what about the flowers and chocolates Shannon deserved?
Why does she look like Lauren Alexis
Buy here a new car 👍
hhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Chris should of said the comment Simon made my girlfriend cry that would of been troll
of course it's simon hitting the window
would've been better if Chris atleast gifted his gyal a new car, cheapskate 🤣🤣🤣
U should do something with the frontmen
Hello
Cwasson
The swearing in this video
the way its not his car means there is actually a forfeit lol. the  dedication  tho
6:47 : We're not falling for this again
Sick video
I thought you’d buy her a new car not just fix the window lol
I think the building behind had more damage done than the car
This man has the best video ideas ever
The comment section is the real MVP.
some kid gonna slip and fall on all that glass and end up in the hospital ahaha
Damn almost 1m views in 21 hrs
'please dont leave me' looooooooooool
Dislike for the click bait 👎

Next video: Buying my Girlfriend a new car!

Should have sat Harry’s mum in the car can bet harry would hit the window every time that way
Simon could've easily gone pro tbh!!
The blonde guy speaking at 7:12 looks like jake paul ARE SIDEMAN COLLABING WITH HIM.
Unpopular opinion: Would be a better vid if they had stuck to the rules
Anyone hear Chris swear on his main channel ?
Send me the number of yo girl bruh
We all knew that Simon would be the one to do it
You can tell the r8 is simply photoshopped because the wheels are literally spinning in place
lmfao
why has jj died his hair blonde again?
NGL it fucking deserves it
Whose idea was it to put the net in front of a glass building
You're girlfriend looks like Lauren Alexis and you didn't tell her about the dent in the rear wheel arch, hahaha
The building behind the goal is in more danger than the car
That’s Chris’s revenge for the trim he got 😂
Hi
Theo was jokes in this
‘’Please don’t leave me’’  -chris Dixon

It only cost him £150 pound to fix it and he is most probably gonna make that back I think that's well invested
Fucking clickbait dude
number 2 on trending my guy
Please don’t leave me 😂😂😂
This is one of the best vids Chris has done
The cutest moment ever is 8:23 to 8:32
She would have fly kicked you if it wasnt repaired

Shooters hand!???
This was one or the funniest videos ever🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 we need a part 2 same people🤣🤣🤣🤣
The please don't leave me... Perfection.
What a banger I love this content
Banger tbh
Theo is underrated
shannon really looks like lauren alexis
As if you've done this you already made Shans parents believe you've smashed it once noe you have actually done it 🤣🤣🤣
Theo n Cal just magically join the sidemen😭😭
Just realised imagine someone plays on that pitch and does a cal the dragon and tries to save the shot and jumps on a piece of glass
U got enough money to buy her got knows how many lambos mate 🤣 fixing that care is basically nothing for your bank account. Oh yeah and Simon 🐐🐐
2:14 rare footage of chris swearing
Absolutely smashing!
Okay, the wheels on the R8 in the thumbnail was were moving so idk if it’s really clickbait
So next video does this mean you're buying your girlfriend a new car?
I hate the united states. It's been robbing me my entire life
Imagine if it was a mitre football
gotta respect the shithousery in the thumbnail 🤣🤣
You should buy her a new car
You let the man who’s most popular clip is “time to smash it” hit balls at your car?
Some is getting dumped after that
Stupidity at its best
The best please give me a shout out in your next video
it’s the please don’t leave me😂😂
Chris at the end, PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME
my dissapointment when simon didn't say "time to smash it" man
Car in the thumnail aint even in the video
First time I ever heard Chris swear  I’ve been watching him for 6 years
Buy her a new car, be a nice guy
Its The revenge for the Trim
Shuhs
This might be the greatest video ever
Why clickbait with an R8 tho??!
Ngl I thought he was gonna buy her a new car
Chris’s next video : Surprising my GF with a new car !
Imagine making a montage of your girlfriend's car getting smashed
if he stops the ball, then he's still getting hurt.. if he doesn't stop the ball, his cars getting hurt
“Buying my girlfriend her dream car” video inbound
Haha
He’s like “please don’t leave me” she’s just sitting there in tears 😂
You better be buying her a new car Chris mate !
Simon to start full forward for Mayo next year ??
IS ANYONE GOING TO SAY THAT THE FIELD IS EXACTLY IN FRONT OF A FLIPPING GLASS BUILDING?
Why does she look like Lauren Alexis?
FR Thought this dude boutta actually buy his girl a new car hahaha
Why do they seem so suprized every time they hit the car as if they ain't aiming at it?
Are we sure this isn't just more top class insta editing
Maybe Belle Delphine has a spare car...
Alertnative title : Can I The Sidemen Stop Bullying Me?
Hopefully he didn’t show her that while she was in her period
1:06 I like that edit
The thing is if he did not want the window to break. Why did he not close it fully?
I used to like Harry and was saying Noone would cared if he died as a joke cos I heard him say it to someone before but I genuinely don't like his fuckery. He's not funny
Cmon Simon first Kons go pro and now Shannon’s fiat
Does no one car Callux is wearing a coat and shorts
Nice clickbait smh
"Please don't leave me" 8:30
Bro cals outfit 😭😭
Can always count on Simon for video
Who's senior whispy hair
Let’s goooooo Simone fire video 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
8:29 🤣🤣🤣
Things i learned today:  Chris can swear now (man's growing with his audience) Fiat 500s are pretty durable
This is a fucking banger video ahahahahah Chris is in the dog house until COVID is over
Simón “time to smash it”
Simon becoming the best person ever
Oh Max ❤
When you think about it 150 quid is actually nothing cuz he is going to make more than 150 quid in this video
Please dont leave me -Chrismd 2021
It's a miracle the car alarm did not go off once
Shannon looks like Lauren alexis
Simon smashed that!
Naa this is too funny, Chris is low key getting mad at them fucking about 😂
is it just me or shanon looks a lot like lauren alexis?...
Simon is so boring he ain’t made for these types of vids
'SHE'S CRYING!' *Nervous laughter level 1000*
Liked it before even watching it because you already know it’s a bangaaa
R.I.P the car
Never knew that Chris swears on camera
"PlEaSe DOnT lEavE meH." Quote ChrisMD 8:30
2 ChrisMD uploads in a week?!?!?😳
Simon took the "its time to smash it" meme to a whole new meaning
Bunch of millionaires destroying a poor persons car then paying 150 to fix it instead of copping her a new whip😂
Someone: would you slap one of the sidemen for 1 million pounds?  Me: no I don’t need to slap jj for a million I’ll do it for free as long as I can slap Viks bully
Everyone: yes  Me: no sorry no chance you don’t know how to play football
Title - Can I stop the sidemen's shots with my car Real title - Can the sidemen destroy my girlfriend's car
Next vid- buying my gf a Tesla
still cheaper than a pack opening
His videos atm are so bloody good
Didn’t think this would be this much entertaining 😂
Balls of steel
Now get her a new car? 👀
Ethans laugh is so funny
Thank god he is back doing football videos loved it mate 💪
dont know if this is real or not
Poor keeper next time sunday league is on diving through shattered glass😂
Time to smash it
I couldn't fucking stop laughing wtf
Hope you cleaned up all that glass 😂😂
Harry hugging Simon for that shot was so sweet ❤
Time to smash it
The fact Simon looked so worried and he felt bad
Questo è un’insulto per noi italiani🤬
You could‘ve bought a new Fiat 500 and still don‘t give a shit about the car.
This is a banger lol
This video was class 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I pity the next goalie on that field... all those broken glass.
DOES ANY ONE KNOW THE LOCATION OF THE PLACE ?
Why would some one build a glass office behind a football goal, or a football goal in front of a glass office
Should have done another video for “trying to win my girlfriend a new car”
I don't even know now if the car is actually there or not
#1 on trending go on chris
The naughty zebra gratifyingly entertain because hawk baly bolt from a shaggy author. ad, unique request
6:32 TIME TO SMASH IT
This is the Nokia of all cars... 🚗
Best vid of yours I think, fucking class
Top video this
Time to smash it
I really wish Simon would say ‘Time to smash it’ before he abolished Chris’s car
Miniminter: DONT SAY IT Miniminter: *TIME TO SMASH IT*
Chris: Can I save the sidemen’s shot at my car? Miniminter: Time to smash it
Well if you think about it, 150 quid for a new window is cheaper than buying someone a new ps5 as a prize of the video or something   and it was much more entertaining to watch lol
buy her a new one mate
Buy her a new car you cheapskate
Why put an r8 in the thumbnail
yeah let's pretend like the car window wasn't slightly opened to make it easier for the ball to smash the window
the "please don't leave me" was hilarious
Please don’t leave me!! 🤣🤣 hilarious
Shannon looks absolutely shattered.                Like the car window
Anybody else only click the video just because the car in thumbnail
Next time don't put an R8 on the thumbnail disappointed. And the fiat is 1500$ maybe less. So it's not a big deal cause video already made more than that.
Just a big ad for fiat this is
Cheaper than a pack opening
I don't like his videos with the sidemen to be honest
Yo that audi in the thumbnail was the car me and my brother crashed with yesterday, i hate YouTube now for recommending me this video
Youu didnt show to her the footage when Simon says he feels terrible
It would’ve been over if Chris said that Shannon has to pay to get it repaired 😂
Anyone know the make of jumper he’s wearing ?
The “please don’t leave me” got me
This is the most ridiculous and stupid idea. Regret watching.
commented just to comment
Next video I buy my gf a new car
4:01 I’m Dead 😂😂😂
should've bought her a new car, can't be dating a member of Fiat 500 twitter.
Theo’s so funny
What is freezys fit
The insurance company: So what exactly happened to your car ?
Clickbaiw fok your Chanel
It would’ve been sweet if he bought her a new car
Simon is a savage yk
You owe her a new car I’d say
Mate you don’t understand how much I wanna try Taco Bell 😂
Try this with professional footballers xd
Clean the glass up from the grass lads
Shannon: literally in tears  The boys: 🥳🥳🥳🥳
You got BALLS mate
simon: " Time to smash it "
When she’s crying everyone in the video is celebrating and I’m just dying here
I cried when Chris said Fu**ing. You can tell he’s pissed off😂😂
ahhhhh poor fiat
Have to say, Simon has some right peg on him
Car insurance voided for the rest of your life 😂
To whoever is reading this:  I know it's not always easy, but you will feel better You are not alone. You are important, no matter whether you see it or not. You matter, I promise Don't give up, think positively and believe in yourself ( ◜‿◝ )♡  Have a good day/night 🖤🖤🖤
The window was left open slightly so it would smash easier.....🤔
YESSSSSSS SIMONN
What I learnt from this is all the people who shouted at me for kicking a ball at their car when I was younger can shut up 😂 barely did anything
harry only aims right when he's aiming for something bahaha
I love how every video was family friendly and now there’s a shit done of cursing like who broke him
Next video title: So we broke up… Just playin chap great video
Content
Why does Calfreazy look like a twat in this video?
Everyone is a gangstar untill vik walks in
this reminds me of the og football challenges when everyone just took the piss, it’s so good man😂
I’m liking the vid plainly on the max reference at 1:10
Fake glass again but still love jt
Chris at the end😂😂 "Pls don't leave me"😂😂
Who else watching because Simon said he hit an insane shot in his podcast
What a fucking clickbait
Smudge is just like 👀
Covid. No social distancing. Dislike from me. Sorry.
I wonder how he explained how he broke the window
Why is Simon playing pro football tho?
Buy her a new car 😤
Let me guess your next video is buying my girlfriend a new car😂
Chris is probably single after this video
He literally said 'please don't leave me'
Shannon: *starts crying*  Chris: *laughs hard*  Lad
Can u do more videos like this?
thumbnail R8  video fiat 500
Harry is just clearly trying to break the building behind the car classic Harry.
pleaseee dont leavee meeee
Simon should of been the one to pay for the damages
8:30 please dont leave me hahahahaha
Banger
It had to be Simon😂😂😂😂  Tbf if Harry’s shot had hit the window it wouldn’t have survived to face Simon
2 uploads in one week, is ChrisMD back
The next keeper playing in that goal is going to get shredded by that glass
Me at 18 with still no first car watching a clean car get peppered
When can we Buy the no. 10 hoodie in black ?
Chris: “she’s legit crying” “Please don’t leave me” 😂
Crying at max
8:44 the look on his face is priceless
next video “buying my girlfriend her dream car!” 😂😂
Time to setup the tinder Chris
Funniest thing is Chris makes the Fiat look big
Sharon be looking like Lauren Alexis 🤔🤔
This video is great hahahahahaha
With those views you definitely got those 150 pounds back 🤣🤣
Has Chris moved to London?
6:25 tip for kids: window was slightly open cause if all windows are closed there is no way of beaking it even with a rock
When Chris uploads you know it’s a banger
No one:  Ethan:🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Well that's a relationship ending video
ahahahpleasedontleaveme
Scenes from Simon to be fair
Disappointed ‘Time to smash it’ didn’t play before Simon obliterated it :(
Nice one Simon, now the family is crying
Practically every round was free shot round
2:32 this is the most chrismd idea I have ever seen in my life. He has a point tho
i thought he‘ll buy her a new car
this video is class
Let’s bang 1millikn views for Chris he deserves it 😭
Do it with your car next
Me when my mum asks why did the teacher call her: 6:53
Poor Chris got violated 😂
Part 2 Please Like so he can see!
now there's glass in the grass
Ethan’s laugh is too jokes
Next vid “we are surprising my girlfriend with a new $10,000 car”
I imagine Chris said she’d get a new car out of this, which if Harry and Stephen’s promised items mean anything then she can maybe get a new one next year.
This was class
its much easier to brake it if the window isnt closed all the way
What happens now when a match is played on that pitch and the keeper is diving on glssd
why was this so hilarious, I literally cried cus of simon
I feel for the people in Insurance office 😂
i did actually hit a car once with a knuckleball and the car had a dent at the back
Ethan laughs constantly and it’s so funny
where is ksi vikk and josh
Bro. Remember when Chris was PG? 😂
Shan aka Lauren alexis
Seeing grown men pelt a football at a car really made my day
You gotta do the YouTuber thing and buy her a car now Chris
Hes sleeping on the floor to night
This is defo photoshopped
Only Simon is capable of breaking the window. He has the most power behind his shot!!
Chris’s girlfriend kinda look like Lauren Alexis
One of the Best Chrismd Videos😂😂
Ah clickbaited with the audio got me
7:54 lauren alexis, wish version
@MrBeast
is chris on something because he has uploaded three times in the space of like 3 weeks
man said at the end: "please dont leave me"
The Max and Keane edits 😂😂😂
Fuck yes for the Max edit 🤣🤣🤣
I love the fact he goes "Please don't leave me" 😂😂 bloody Legend Chris
4:02 did we just hear Chris swear for the first time in a youtube video?
Next up, Girlfriend ties boyfriend to stakes in the ground so her friends can take hockey shots at his nuts.  You deserve it Chris.
Next video idea:  I got My girlfriend a new car
"Please don't leave me" killed me
Chris looks so small in the goal
Chris MD is now sweaing 😂😂😂😂. Us as an audiance have grown up now. I feel old 😮
Swearing this isn’t a chrismd video
I think Chris’ content is less PG now because his audience is growing up alongside him
im ngl, i hadnt seen shannon in a long time, so when I saw her rn i was confused as to what lauren alexis was doing at chris' house
Breaks Shannon's car Chris: please don't leave me 😂
When this video blows up and Chris is like Shan u got anything I could borrow haha
6:05 reference only british people would understand, i love it xD
Rt thought that was Lauren alexis 💯
I have lost so must respect for cal in these videos
Even though I got totally click baited, was actually a banger!
Wait harry still wears the jacket he bought for the eating one colour for 24 hours vid props to him
*trying to break windows whole video*  *breaks window * everyone - :oo
Love a good max smith cameo
Did someone else thought that he is going to buy her a new car in the end of a video?
spends more in a fifa pack opening haha
Simon should do a same video with his vespa
Sidemen easter eggs
they kinda ruined the video
U kno Chris is pissed when he swears lol
honestly feels good to see simon in a football video
6:30 “time to smash it” Simon has been about this life for years!
Chris just buy shannon a new car. Be easier than the insurance claim
Your mrs looks like Lauren alexis
What a banger!! 😂😂😂
this is what lockdown has done to chris
Ughhh i was waiting for a "time to smash it"
No one else annoyed at the thumbnaill
Photoshop
Legendary 🤘🤘
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE ACTUALLY CRIED 🤣🤣
Plz dont leave me😂😂😂
8:27 callux
No resurrection this time
Chris next video: Giving my girlfriend her dream car !!
Thumbnail : Audi Video : Fiat  😂
Imagine if Simon said "time to smash it" before breaking the window
Does be using them for clout
Really
Clickbait: Simon Made my girlfriend cry
Next video getting my girlfriend a new car
alternative title: I BROKE MY GIRLFRIEND CAR AND MADE HER CRY!!! (GONE WRONG)
click bait that wasn't your car or an Audi R8 but your R8 on the line and let Simon smash them windows
Next video:buying my girlfriend a new car
Buy her a new car you tight git
Harry: *Does everything possible to break something and still misses* Simon: *Breaks the window* Harry: *OH NOOOOOOOO*
Clickbait. That ain’t no Audi R8
Next time Simon meets Chris and his gf is going to be so awkward lol
😂😂😂😭😭
Chris:please don't leave me 🤣🤣
While laughing  hysterical  please don’t leave me
“the sidemen”
2 vids in 1 week I think someone might need to see if he is alright
I wanna know how u got home 😂
“ please don’t leave me “   — ChrisMD
Yall are acting like he dosnt say curse word omg he didnt bleep it out it's not that big of a deal
You went to far with the audi r8 click bate
Dunno if its cuz i'm getting old but my first thought was all that glass on the floor for anyone else who plays there, even if you think you've cleaned it up there'd still be some left?
Buy her a new car chris
8:30 “please don’t leave me” 😭😭😂😂
Would have been so much better if Simon said "Time to smash it" right before ahah
You're a brave man Chris 🤣
I came for the Audi 😂😂
he better buy her a new car
Fun Fact. He profited from this video
bbc will now have a legit article this time
NGL nice content Chris ❤️❤️❤️
hi
Just get in the dog house now mate
Since the lads loved taking the strikes they should all just put few quid in each get Shannon a new car think it’s time for an upgrade anyways
commenting for the youtube algorithm
Now she hates Simon
She is leaving you😅🤣🤣🤣
8:31 please don’t leave me
Please dont leave me😂
This needs to be a sidemen Sunday
Simon minter 👑
8:30 best fucking part
Knew he wasn’t raw enough to use his own car
8:35 thickyminter
Bangerrr
6:21 you can thank me later ;)
High risk high reward on another level this
Next video: "buying my girlfriend her dream car"?
“PLEASE DONT LEAVE ME🥺”~ChrisMD
thought you were going to give her a new car, this is the Mr Beast effect
Sidemen fans said Simon is weak...... what about that shot!!! f**king hell that was ammmazing 😱
Shannon felt what the window felt: absolutely shattered
amazing video
Simon is going to feel so bad when he see's Shannon's reaction xD
Why the footballers are so crazy😒😒😒😒
Simon never disappoints.
Simon better watch this video and see shan's reaction, that was priceless
W2S was looking so handsome .
wait what, i thought it was an audi r8 not a fiat 500 !!
Can’t wait for the “getting my gf a new car” video
Freezy and his shorts are just built different
Another class ChrisMD video
Best line " Please don't leave me" 8:33
first time I’ve seen Shannon and I’m getting proper Lauren Alexis vibes.. anyone?
next video i broke up with my girlfiend
Anyone else got clickbaited because of the R8 yeah me too
whats the instrumentel at 8:34
Buy her a new car
did Shannon get a new car.. or?
Warzone random trios live @Maluge 316 here on YouTube! Come hang out and play if you would like!
As usual, Simon carry all the football video
h
nobody: chris: puts edm music while simon is destroying shannons car
You mean you got the cheaper to pay for a video 'sidemen' challenge fuck off lol freezy isn't a part of the sidemen there's like three of them
starting my morning off with a banger...cheers chris x
Loved that inbetweeners reference 🤣🤣
Poor Chris 😂
I know Chris was planning on paying for damages and most likely set it up himself, but these Sidemen dudes just seem like massive dicks in this video
Is it me or shanon looks kinda like lauren alexis
This is just a regular day in Jersey
I seriously thought chris going to gift her a new car... Wow
I should never have to see Freezys legs that much 😂😂
the hit: 6:29
Next video is Chris buying Shan a new car.
It would be jokes if you out Spencer celebrating when Hashtag won the title/their first FA Cup game when Simon obliterated the window lmao
one of the funniest videos I've seen since the takeaway video well done Chris
Banger
I've never seen someone try to sabotage a relationship this much
Worst CAR EVER
Yooo Chris your girlfriend single?
"Don't leave me" kkkkkkk It's your own fault Chris mate!
Who else thought the break was fake at first?
He should rename this “ 9 minutes of getting bullied”
Simon miniminter is a troll😂
you lot need to do more videos together this was sickkkkkkk!!
Chris becomes a guest of his own channel
Plz don’t leave me lol 8:30
Simon jus puttin the glass back in the car at the end
Shouldn’t cuss, God Bless
So for Chris’s next video    Why I became single, and made it to the next sidemen tinder
Weak as fuck given it a few dents n smashing one window would have been better content smashing the car properly then getting your girl a better new car
6:34 trust me u wanna see this
Everyone watching this: I see this as an absolute win!
“Pls don’t leave me...🥺🥺” was too much for me 🤣🤣❤️
Nah fam if you do that to your girls car you got to at least buy her a brand new one, not just get it repaired.
Bet she thought she was getttin a new whip, nah new window loool
I thought you were gonna pull a david dobrik and buy here a car.. nope, oh how the mighty have fallen
The editing and just the overall vid was class
At this point you should just buy her a new car lol banger of a vid
Where is this pitch
If you have a Fiat 500 then it deserved to get smashed.
Chris next video bought a new car for my gf
Simon breaking the window made it worth while to watch
The please dont leave me had me dead lmfaaoo
If Chris’ next video isn’t him buying Shannon a new car I’m going to be seriously disappointed 🤣🤣
Simon took “time to smash it” seriously lol
I don’t think she likes his friends anymore
Cal the dragon would have saved that
Chris got bullieddd in this lmao
hi
A wise man once said - "Time to smash it"
Is it me or is that the worst but coolest soccer pitch spot ever, the scenery is nice and all but if someone hits it over the fence, they’re breaking the window on the building
Chris said a swear in his video never heard that before
2:13 it’s happend.
Great video, But both thumbnail and title are click bait...

Lambo next
Please don’t leave me 🤣🤣🤣
Fuckin creasing man hahahaha
It had to be Simon.😂😂😂😂💖💖💖💖

What is the song playing at 8:35 in the background
The ending makes Simon look like the villain 🤣
Feel sorry for the next kid that has to go in goal
4:01 4:01 HE DIDNT BLEEP A SWEAR WORD *HE DIDNT BLEEP A SWEAR WORD*
Honestly one of the best videos he’s released
Simon cancelled now 😃
Lads im calling it now. next video is going to. be " SURPRISING MY GIRLFRIEND WITH HER DREAM CAR"
Ok at first i was enjoying it but then i saw shanon crying and chris told please don’t leave me that just made my day😂😂😂😂
Reit can often be disappointing.  Look at his car in his thumbnail and in real life
1:57  OMGGGG it finaly happennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
HE SWORE
why did Chris do 2 videos in 1 day
Your girlfriend looks like Lauren alexis lol

Stupid idea 👎

Just me or is Simon just boring to watch in football videos now
Chris is not funny anymore 😢

Nice photoshop
BANGER VIDEO
When chris said “please don’t leave me” I laughed

Chris did anyone break a window in the building yet?
1:13  I actually thought It was going to break
"PLeaSe dOn't LeAVe Me"😂😂
Lmfao max 😂😂
The abhorrent linen typically man because thunderstorm finally sparkle around a rebel frost. skillful, broken salary
Schadenfreude: The Video
4:56?
What happened to bleating swear words
I like how he’s made sure to put Sidemen in the title instead of Youtubers to guarantee that he did well with the vid.
I feel like we have been conned again
A total of 3 “fucks” said by Chris in this video
The 'please don't leave me' got me crying
"Please don't leave me"
PlEase DoNt LeAvE mE had my dying at the end with chris 😂😂
8:23 Chrismd: maniacal laughter  Gf:😵😱😭  PERFECT COUPLE 👍

Class. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Chris: please don't leave me 😂😂
naughty Chris swearing at 4:02
thank you guys, for giving the symbol of feminism a good fucking ball busting
mans was like "plx don't leave me " bruv
Is it me or does Shannon looks a bit like Lauren Alexis
dunno why he's complaining abt spending 150 pound. he's gonna make 100x that off of this vid alone
Chris md mate u are class
This vid had more sidemen football vibes than actual sidemen videos nowadays. Like, they actually ran around to celebrate.
Max 😂😂😂😂
Simon: is a dickhead the entire video also Simon: "feels awful"
OMG she cried lol its a fucking fiat 500
How many video do you think Chris got out of this one day with the boys cause so far there's two 🤔
Hearing Theo say ting like that made me embarrassed to be white
he should have bought her a  new car
I feel like they didn’t know it wasn’t Chris’ car otherwise I don’t think they try so hard to smash in Shannon’s car
the new fortress ?
Isn’t that the girl from the sideman tinder shit lmfao
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
He finally fucking swearing in his vids thank fuck
Why do they all seem to just want to bully and be mean to Chris
"Please don't leave me" why was that the best fucking part omfg
DAMN SHE IS ANGRY hahaha
Chris is gonna be single after this one
why he fuming AT 4:02
Chris Swearing what?? 4:01
No promotion and u just destroyed her car
Chris you officially have too much money
Chris you brave man
Writing the car off as a business expense nice 💡
The “please don’t leave me “ got me 😭😭
I have to say, first ChrisMD video that’s made me cry with laughter in a while. But the respect has defo gone 📈📈📈
Best part was Chris going “please don’t leave me” 😂😂
The next message to simon was    Cheers si  Shans crying
More videos like this
Shannon looks like Lauren alexis btw , keep her away from behz
2:56 best part
language!
Simón really took “time to smash it” to a whole new level this time
This is an elite video 😂😂
Thumbnail bit suss
“Fuck u lot”😂😂
Best video you ever have made
And now Shannon hates 2 Sidemen
Ethans laugh just makes any vid
Shannon please don't leave him😂😂
8:23 yeah Simon that was because of you she cried (and a bit of Chris as well for bringing the car down) poor Shannon 😂
The groundskeeper said “we are charging them more, next time.” At least yous are still welcome 😂
I feel bad for chris
Give her a little upgrade Chris. Or pimp out her car
Waiting for “buying my girlfriend a new car”
Please say she was getting a new car and this was the reason why you got to do this video...
Shannon looks like lauren alexis
I beg Simon reacts to her reaction girl looks heart broken
Chris’ next video “So I broke up...”
Looks like one of them Tesla windows 🤣
Sponsored by Autoglass
Chris saying “please don’t leave me” 😂😂
Wow, Chris has uploaded 2 videos in 4 days. That’s amazing   Ok, he has been uploading quite a bit recently. For him
Not your mrs car tho you live on a different part of the uk what did the car get a plane?
8:04 what is that blurred thing in the background
You came for 6:22. Thank me later
Should of used a Mitre ball
Fiat 500s are rubbish ugly cars. Chris gf can do better.
Next video: Buying Shanon a new car so she doesn’t break up with me
Little ratty hobbit
LADIES Chris is now single so make your move
The fact he had the window slightly opens shows he wanted it to be smashed for views😂
Mate, can't believe you didn't just buy her a new car at that point lmaoooooo
The power on tha
When Chris has no content he has to do this
Do this in Australia and it wouldn't be as cool. All the windows here are tinted. So the glass would shatter, but stay in a giant sheet
At least give the money to her what you will earn from this vid 👎🏽
KSI is better ☺️
Bruh you could’ve at least got her a new car
Its vids like these that are interesting to watch
Next video, “buying my girlfriend a new car”
Please don’t leave me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This video is 10 times better than today's sidemen Sunday, I fell asleep watching that video
The piers Morgan clip 😂😂😂
IS THAT THE SIDEMEN MERMAID???
Please dont leave me😂😂😂
I swear his gf looks like Lauren Alexis or is tha just me?
She looks like Lauren Alexis if she was sold on wish
His gf looks like Lauren Alexis
Add Theo to the group of Chris, Will, Stephen and Harry. Will make it even better
we have an early contender for France Football's Golden Ball award for boyfriend of the year
Can we all appreciate the editing in this video 😂
Lovely how Simon is slowly becoming harry with the hand gestures
I think you should just buy her a new car to be honest mate.
1:09 lovely to see Laurence make a quick cameo
Next ChrisMD video: BUYING MY GIRLFRIEND A NEW CAR!!!! *Not Clickbait*
“Come on Simon for Carly” 😂
8:27 look at the cat
What’s the name of the hoodie Harry is wearing?
Ah yes Theo Baker my favourite sidemen
Clickbait ew
Such a good vid 😂 just great vibes, all you need  Edit: apart from the last minute 😂😂😂
Better value for money than a pack opening
I mean he's clearly doing everything in his power to get her to break up with him
oy this is really shithouse
Nah I thought Chris was gonna buy her a new car after this. My guy just gave it back with the dints as well 💀
That boy Simon got a cannon. Big up
The next video better be "surprising my girlfriend with a new car" or Shannon wont be very happy.
The best UK content creator BIG UP CHRIS <3
I was quite frankly clickbated
I thought this would be one of the videos that he buys his girlfriend a new car
Did the other guys make vids to
Ice cold Simon minter
Watching this while finding out Di María’s family was held hostage... can only hope and pray they’re alright
Chris MD’s Relationship status: “Pending”
MONG SMITH THE LEGEND
Holy sh*t Simon 😵😵😵
Should’ve just bought her a Porsche
Poor Chris has had enough. At the beginning the worst you’d hear is a “dang” but now his heart has hardened and no child’s ears are safe 😂😂
That edit with the crowds is one of the funniest edits I've ever seen 😂
This is like an old school sidemen video
Yo Shannon’s piff
Can we get a vid on it getting fixed i have no trust since the photo shop vid
This ispretty much chris getting bullied for 9:10
Love how Chris just laughs in Shannon’s face while she cries 😭
Honestly the best video I’ve seen in about 5 years 🤣🤣
Theo ain’t even in the sidemen so why is he even in this video😂😂😂🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
did we really hear chrisMD swear in one of his videos?..... damn chris has changed
and now chris lives on the streets of london after he got kicked out of his and shannons house and if you didnt know already he is single after this vid
Chris “fake videos” on ig is coming true now
Only $150 wow
I feel so bad for your gf :(
“Please don’t leave me” had me crying😂😂🤣
There’s no way Chris has sex
Its literally always simon lmao
Hopefully the car will be on autotrader
The fact the money made from this video can probably replace that car with an Audi for her is unreal 😂
Is that the coat Harry bought in the sidemen vid for like £250
yeah she is leaving you this time man u went to far
fake window obvs
I beg simon isn’t in anymore vids he’s so boring it’s unreal
daim she hot
January gotchu click click baiting up the ass lmao
5:51 why does that song sound so 2014
I wanna see Simon react to her crying
Chris being bullied for 9 minutes 🤣🤣
Ahh I fell bad for his gf. They can have much expensive car, but she loves this small car
Why don't you use one of your own cars instead next time and see what a 6 yard smash does to a mercs window 🥴
I hated this ideas when the other guy did it and i hate it when Chris did it
Chris, mate, you gonna have to buy her something hella fucking expensive to make up for it
The only thing that would make that window smashing perfect would be Simon saying 'Time to smash it'
Next W2s video: Helping Chris find a new girlfriend
The shithousery is unmatched 🤣
Window was open, makes it easier to smash lol
nice clickbait
Imagine Chris using his car in the thumbnail but his girlfriend's car in the actual video!😲🤣
When will we see a part 2?
Laughed so much at this
Simon the goat 🐐
Is Chris just like not family friendly anymore lol
I thought this was a pg channel 🤣🤣
Simon is actually goated, man really stepped up when it was time
I thought u had to have at least half the sidemen in the video to use the title
“Please dont leave me” finished me bro 😂😂
Chris '' pls don't leave me ''
Genius.. spent £150 on replacing the broken window but make thousands by posting this video
”The sidemen”. You’re better than this clickbaiting Chris. Truly.
That nervous laugh when he said ‘please don’t leave me’ 😂😂. Had me in tears
anyone else just know that it would be simon
Chris had made football videos good again.
This is worse yet best vid
8:20 makes me hate Simon so much more he’s so annoying the leech
Shiver me timbers, Chris swore 😂😂😭
I think it’s pretty wholesome that even after knowing it’s all Chris’s fault for this video even happening, Simon still apologizes multiple times about doing it
i love these videos with these guys, need more
Class video, as always 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
What a VID
3:50 thought bruno fernandes joined the video
Give it a week and Chris will be making a we broke up video
Best video on YT 🔥
Chris is the only one I know who always uploads original and really funny content
I'm just confused why he'd do this as a video
was it just me who flinched at 2:57
I wonder who would get the cat?
Got Max in another video but still haven't given him his PS5 🤔
8:06 the exact moment Chris became single
8:29 “please don’t leave me” killed me 😭
GET HER A NEW CAR FFS CHRIS
£150 that's barely anything compared to the amount he had to pay everyone to come on his channel
I love that Chris says, don't leave me
Certi vid
Chris is sleeping on the couch for the foreseeable future I think
8:30 Chris begging Shannon not to leave him 😂😂
Surprised he didn’t go typical YouTuber with some clickbait, Miniminter made my Girlfriend cry?!?!
Next video: "Buying my girlfriend a new car!"
"She's crying " saying that whilst laughing at her
8:31 Chris 😂😂😂
Keep up the amazing work Chris
Everybody gangsta til ChrisMD swears
As someone who owns a car. I’m absolutely astounded that Shannon is still with Chris after that. I would’ve been out for blood if that happened to my car.
The max clip 😂😂😂
Freezy looking like the don who forgot pe kit in school and was forced to wear lost and found 😬😬😬
Am i the only one who thinks its fake because car glass shouldnt break like that ? Isnt it supposed to crack without all these splitters ?
Who else feels so bad for the poor man
Bless chris what a hero 😭
At least now if Chris wants to do another Instagram edits video he doesn’t have to edit on a window shattering on his girlfriends car.
"I reckon its a 6 yard ting" Poshest "ting" I've heard 😂
Course it was bloody Simon !
Why theo baker looks like jake paul these days
Of course Simon was the one to break the window
Also smash him a like he really went through alot of trouble just to do this
Cheaper than doing a pack opening 🤷‍♀️
Please bring back the fifa videos.
1000th comment
Chris has a history of making people cry in his videos
My god what? Chris saying swear words and not cutting or bleeping? Wha--
1:09 poor max
2 vids in 4 days? Am I dreaming?
Love the clickbait thumbnail, you can see the fiat behind it and with the r8 the photo was taken while the car was moving cause the rims are blurry as if it was taken when someone was driving it.
For anybody who wants to just watch the window break this is time stamp 6:21
Chris’s next vid, supervising my girlfriend with a new car
The shithousery in this vid
The reference from the ball hitting Max killed me
tbh guys this is a banger of a video
Should've put the window up all the way less chance of smashing
This is a god tier video 😂
Dog house
Does Chris do any videos on his own or does he always have his friends??  I like his content. New to the channel
Can someone timestap where he swears, honestly can't find it
never heard chris say fuck i’m surprised i had to skip back twice
The thumbnail : audi  The car: fiat 500 🤦‍♂️
This was a (smashing) video
Way cheaper and a lot more fun than fifa pack openings 👏👏👏
Absolutely class video
Simon’s instant regret and guilt made that shot 😂
Yes Chris I have been watching your channel for so many years now
When Chris saw Shanon cry...my man's first reaction was plz don't leave me...I am dead😂😂😂😂
chris should just buy Shannon a new boyfriend at this point
My favourite part of this video is when Shannon starts crying and Chris responds by laughing in her face
Thought you’d have a better car than that
Hey Carly catch
Next video: Why we broke up
woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow
1:09, max got a feature!
This is the happiest I’ve seen Harry😂😂
When's your break up video
Anyone else looking at the glass behind thinking they might smash it ?
I thought she was Lauren alexis for a second then 😂
Get her a real car like a gtr or even better an old skyline r34 or mx5 mk1
Brave boy
Wow your a real catch ain’t ya Chris pmsfl. Yeah you had a new window out in but they’ll be bits of glass in that car forever now randomly appearing now and again lol. What about all the dents though?? 🤣🤣
Biggest bunch of vcarders
Chris uploading twice in 4 days haven’t seen that since about 2014
Are u going out with lauren alexis?
This round will be me running from the post and the others just ignoring the rules and just do what they want😂😂
Simon is gonna get a diss track made by Shan probably
He sounded genuinely terrified talking about Shannon coming to see the footage hahah
Whoever goes in goal there next time is gonna get a few cuts
Please don't leave me 😂😂
Bro this is the most Chrismd video ever 😂
Not quite Cal the Dragon
Bruh the please dont leave me lamo
Cheeky little F bomb from chris at 1:58 😂  Edit: and another at 2:14 Edit Edit: and ANOTHER one at 4:01 . Damn my guy is finally using the big boy words.
6:21 is the moment you’re looking for
Hey gotta give him respect for making 2 videos with the same people the same day and uploading them 4 days apart. What an illusion lol. Jkjk love you Chris!!!
never mess with a woman and her fiat 500😅
8:30 throwback to the VIP pass video....oh how the turntables
Next Chris video "expecting why Shannon left me"
Anyone else love the way Chris whispers "please don't leave me"
Quality touch that is by the Fiat? 4:50
why does shannon look sooo much like lauren alexis
Simon is the goat, I don't care what anyone says, he's an absolute legend.
I think Shannon should get revenge and get them to do it to his
Not gonna lie, if it only cost you 150 pounds to fix, that is a damn good investment for a video like this 😂
Notice how he does anything to include the sidemen in their title 😂
He’s getting the most of that hour at the rented pitch
Insurance: So how did your car window break? Chris: Its complicated
she cares more about the car then chris
This is why Chris stayed in jersey for so long
That Zealand outro music do be hitting different
Imagine tommyinit in this video
Chris, are you ok?? Two videos in the same week
I’m loving the videos now Chris can’t be arsed to make them family friendly
Simon brought her to TEARS😂
please don't leave me had me going crazy I was crying
The only thing that can destroy a fiat 500 is a giant romanian truck
That Karen when you accidentally hit their car: 🤬🤬🤬 Chris: I’m about to end this girl’s whole career
Simon @ 6:30 : Time to smash it.
Cals a B-Tech Ollie McBurnie
Holy shit mate bit far a video
such an unreal vid lmao
He says the car is his girlfriends than says that it belongs to her sister, sweat home Alabama
WHAT? I was totally expecting you to buy her a new car after this😤!!!
Still better than spending 150 pounds on Fifa points to be fair
Chris saying the F word on the main channel!? Unheard of!!
Just got here and I seriously hope Shan gets a new car by the end of this video.
That is by far the best video I’ve seen all of 2021
He was just minding his own business eating fries 1:09
Anyone know where the pitch is?
” please don’t leave me” 😂😂😂
Chris’s new video title: Me and Shannon broke up
Look what uve done simon😂
Bet Simon feels awful after seeing Shan cry lol
Chris's nxt video buying my girlfriend a new car 🚗
I had to unsub from most of them, why would anyone agree to try and smash someones car
When did chris start swearing???
I feel like i know the background song, what is it... anyone???  The first one to clarify
Max better be getting his PS5 after taking a ball in the face for your video 😂
I loved how Chris says please don’t leave me
Stop the clickbait
Ooo
I like how he used the celebrations when England scored versus Croatia in 2018....Look how that ended up
Consecutive uploads woah
Simon's next video: I Made ChrisMD's Girlfriend Cry!
You guys, stop crying, just hecause he didn't bleep out the curse words. Doesn't mean you guys can get offended. Get over it.
Wow Theo’s hair looks amazing ! He’s recovered so well
That was a rough one
THE WAY HE SAYS "PLEASE DONT LEAVE ME" LMAOO
We need more of these Chris love this video
8:30” Please don’t leave me”
Chris is the only guy we all don't mind being click baited by 🤣 glad you're smashing it
The fiat 500 was turned into a fiat 250 by Simon
I thought Max would be safe in a ChrisMD video 😆
Let’s go Simon 👍🏻😂
“Pls don’t leave me”😂
Poor shannon
love this man for this more like this and his channel will blow up
I hope your buying her a new 1 m8
set up the next vid nicely. buys gf a new car
Since when does chris md swear in his vids 😂
I want to see simon in the comments
Yes simon😂
Wanna see that again tho
Ft. Papa Smith
"Please dont leave me" 😂
How many windows were smashed making this video?
chris has little spells where he actually has a normal upload schedule
I love the vibes of this lot🏅and ethans laugh makes it so much funnier 😂🙌
The ChrisMD channel is really down bad
2 in one week?
leaving glass on a goal keepers line?
Chris’s next video until he fixed it: I got kicked out
Best Chris md video ever
“Please don’t leave me”😂😂😂
This was s class material
Please dont leave me made me die of laughter
4:02 Chris is getting a bit frisky with what he’s saying
Why does Shannon look like Lauren Alexis in this vid?😅
No way you got the glass and all the dents repaired for 150, it a shame cause those dents can be repaired to an extent but the damage is still visibly seen, i feel sorry for her
Alternative title- Chris gets bullied all day then as soon as he gets home makes his girlfriend cry
Next video title: "Meet my new girlfriend"
Chris’s new video:Getting my girlfriend a new car!!
why is he doing Max Smith from The Stephen Tries Podcast dirty lie that?
this could bang and now chris can do a "buying my gf a supercar" vid now too lmao
Legends say that car is more stable than the CyberTruck.
Simon is loaded I would have mad him buy her a new car 😂😂😂
Quality video idea
lets pray you vacuumed all the glass up.... next goalie is going to die jumping for the ball lol
Today I make my girlfriend cry for clicks.
I have never seen chis swear before
Was an r8 in the thumbnail which is beyond the only reason I clicked.
This max and Chris beef is getting g out of hand😂😂😂😂😂
hope you’ve got car insurance lad
Shannon had the ak-47 ready for Chris coming home
Place your bets on how much longer that relationship is going to last👇
nice of you guys to smash a window over the keepers area 👍 seems like a thoughtful idea 🤦‍♂️
Swearing on the Chris MD channel
Gotta love ChrisMD
Simon saved this video lol
When there’s only 3 of the sidemen in the video. We all know Chris 😂😂
8:29 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bangerrr
0:55 was it Gary Neville’s commentary.
next video is a breakout video XD
0:27 only real ones will know where did harry got his jacket
“Please don’t leave me”😂😂
Chris, I really like you, but clickbait is a big no no. Please don't, especially since you're a very genuine person, you don't need it.
Please do more Sunday league football videos they are so funny!😂😂
It was probably Freezy😂😂😂
Damn I thought he was going to gift her a new car at the end😂
Chris even came for his arch nemesis Max in this vid, I can't belive it
The sidemen are lowkey asses, especially in a large group
I LOVE Chris but I feel we need a bit more videos with JUST him. Like the  old days.
The next 5 videos are going to be asking where Shan is 😂😭
Expectation- Audi R8 Reality- Fiat 500
New title: “This football challenge made my girlfriend cry” *NOT CLICKBAT*<—like actually not this time
Shanon looks like a b tech version of Lauren Alexis lol
Chris just begging to Shan please don’t leave me
'Please don't leave me'
When u run out of ideas and gf pisses u off so u got an excellent way of getting back at her 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
For people saying "omg chris swore". How would you feel if your car was getting pelted by a ball lol
But I new car Shan  next video 😂
10 pounds Shan leaves by next video
This was shambolic and I loved every second
8:07 when Simon watches this he’ll feel really bad
2:1 let’s go mate
"Please Don't Leave Me" OMG LMAO IM DYING
Yes
are you sure it was smart to post two videos so close together? are you sure you dont want to spread them out?
I cant believe I didn't question that thumbnail🤣
Chris really running out of ideas huh
YEEEEESSSS!! FOOTBALL VID
chris deserves a like for this
He’s definitely buying her a new car
the thumbnail was R8, you tricked me
Poor Chris got bullied and telling Shannon “please don’t leave me.” Had me crying 🤣🤣
Could you imagine the insurance providers face if they saw this video after a claim
The sidemen were having way to fun with that also Chris should of bought her a brand new car for that imagine the content then
Next video: Why my girlfriend broke up with me
are we going to just breeze over the fact that chris made the title "the sidemen"?
That please don't leave me at the end really made my laugh
I thought you’re car was on the thumbnail 😅
chris is dying on the inside
chris secretly just got dumped so he’s wrecking his ex’s car and making excellent content. Well done Chris
She is a First Price Lauren Alexis
ChrisMD is off the rails
I know Simon did it but after he was like I feel so bad it made me feel bad for him
When u make ur lil bro go in goal
My language when I am around my parents - old MD  My language round my friends- This video
Thought this was gonna be a proper David dobrik video and he was going to buy her a new car. Cheers lad
😂
Poor Sunday league keeper getting shards of glass stuck in him everytime he dives next match 😂😂😂
You’re a bad boyfriend 😂😂 but GG lad 😂👌🏼
I can’t be the that thinks Shan looks like Lauren Alexis in this video
We acc need more content from this group XD
I am so confused, can someone explain to me, the balls that go over arent they hitting the windows in the back!?!
That fiat got more destroyed than Chris's original video ideas
No one:  Chris about to be dumped: insert ncs dubstep
The only person that can save Chris's car is ollie
So that’s why there’s been two videos in quick succession 😂😂😂 Fixing the car as a business expense 🙌
oh chris man, you're in big big trouble lol
bruh theres bots lol
Welp... Chris is definitely sleeping on the couch for the next foreseeable future
done. It is not serious but I looked at Chriss's dms: *uniid.lol* poor girlfriend, I hope it changes Chriss not talking to himself is actually weirder than him being alone
NDL NDL
£150 is not that bad for a broken window tbh
Shoulda just used a mitre football there woulda been a hole through the car
this is amazing
Please don’t leave me😂😂😂😂😂
Rate the clickbait
Simon "The Glass Destroyer" Minter
What a stupid idea for a video lad
Can’t beilve shan started crying 😂😭
THE SONG MAN AT THE END 6:32 DO YOU FEEL YOUR BALLS SHAKE? DO YOU FEEL YOUR BUM BUM SHAKE? 💀
That was really funny, stop bullying max though
done. It is not serious but I looked at Chriss's dms: *uniid.lol* poor girlfriend, I hope it changes Chriss not talking to himself is actually weirder than him being alone
8:30 i had to laugh so hard because of that
2:14 seeing that Chris is probably no longer a PG channel
an uncensored "fuck off" from chris ahahaha
6:52 me to the ref when i two-foot the opponent and break his leg
SERGIO PIQUE!
Harry:I think it’s window or nothing  Me:is he talking about him after he gets caught ?
quality content. what more can you ask for on a sunday than making your own girlfriend cry?
Please dont leave me😂
I live this ❤️❤️
Shannon is going to break up with you Chris after this video
We need the Goat Vikkstar in one of these😂👀
Next chrismd video "we broke up"
done. It is not serious but I looked at Chriss's dms: *uniid.lol* poor girlfriend, I hope it changes Chriss not talking to himself is actually weirder than him being alone
To make up for it you should gift her some of your merch
you replaced the window but all the dents tho. think you need to treat that girl to a new motor
Worth it!
The “please don’t leave me” got me 😂
Feels bad for ur gf
done. It is not serious but I looked at Chriss's dms: *uniid.lol* poor girlfriend, I hope it changes Chriss not talking to himself is actually weirder than him being alone
What a video🙌🏽
Chris saying f word
6:31 is why your all here.
done. It is not serious but I looked at Chriss's dms: *uniid.lol* poor girlfriend, I hope it changes Chriss not talking to himself is actually weirder than him being alone
Theo’s hair looking like straight up Donald Trump
RIP to the goal keeper whos in goal next, will dive to save a goal and will end up with glass through his ribs
If there was any man to smash a ball through a Fiat 500 window it would be Simon Minter😂😂😂
done. It is not serious but I looked at Chriss's dms: *uniid.lol* poor girlfriend, I hope it changes Chriss not talking to himself is actually weirder than him being alone
when chris said plz dont leave me i lost it😂
“Come on Simon, for Carly”
banger
So that’s 2/7 sidemen Shannon hates
I don't feel bad for chris i feel for the who ever the goal keeper that gonna be playing there
Really good saves Chris and everybody has a good boot
As soon at Chris showed Shan the footage , Chris’s bag was packed 😂
Chris giving the sidemen free shots at Shannon’s car My thought What a great boyfriend.
4:00 first time I’ve ever heard Chris say fuck
Breaking News: YouTuber ChrisMD has Just been spotted on UK Tinder
Next video...we broke up
“Time to smash it”
I fucking love this 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
In reality title: 5 skets break my girls car and I can't be asked (gone wrong)
Daily updates from Chris? Impossible
In the US that window is costing 500 minimum so I’d say big Chris got quality out of that
First of all that's Shannon's car and was stealing Ollie's video idea not enough now your stealing your friend that looks like Peter crouch's idea ,apolling
Only £150? Hmmm
2:16 that behz volley 😭😭
The building in the back got me anxiety
Chris didn't beep his swear word 4:02 😮
This was a glass video Chris
Simon literally just did a ronaldo knuckleball to Shannon's car. Fam Leeds need to recruit him bruv
No, It can’t be. 2 uploads in one week
Absolute banger mate 😂😂
Moral of the story: fiat 500=indestructible
I swear that isnt chris in the thumbnail
we love to see you filming with these boys it’s been a long time coming don’t stop it we love to see this
Die Fiat
I actually don't like how Chris is letting them do this and then they all just act like dicks. Feel sorry for him that they were like that.
done. It is not serious but I looked at Chriss's dms: *uniid.lol* poor girlfriend, I hope it changes Chriss not talking to himself is actually weirder than him being alone
banger
Chris and Shannon r genuinely the cutest couple out there
just waiting for simon to comment here haha
Commentary for Simons shot should have been “WHAT A HIT SON”
I turned off my adblocker for this
Can I ask something..... why? Just why?
That fiat is stronger than my uncles military grade land rover defenders
Does the goat reply?
i felt so bad for chris
This might be one of my favourite chrismd videos in while. that was jokes.
Oooooooommmmmmmmgggggggg!!!!!!!!!!
Real title chrismd gets pissed af
DANG
done. It is not serious but I looked at Chriss's dms: *uniid.lol* poor girlfriend, I hope it changes Chriss not talking to himself is actually weirder than him being alone
This was Honestly the funiiest video I've watched for ages. I were reaaly gasping for air in the end when we saw your girlfriends reaction, hahah. Well done mate
2 videos in 4 days jesus chris
Behz is just kinda annoying
This is just the Sidemen bullying Chris 😂
Umm the car on the thumbnail is a little bit different
Aww poor Shannon she actually seemed upset
6:30 time to smash it
done. It is not serious but I looked at Chriss's dms: *uniid.lol* poor girlfriend, I hope it changes Chriss not talking to himself is actually weirder than him being alone
Love the vids Chris and the uploads recently vids are banging
Fantastic
8:29 *rare footage* of callux and Sarah's break up
Alternative title 8 men abusing a car
Chris:Borrows Shannon’s car to smash it. Shannon: Arranging the break up.
More
Chris no longer cares about swearing. Quarantine has really affected everyone
Your camera must of been at a funny angle cause the car looks a little bit different then it does in the thumbnail
Who would have thought a bunch of idiots hiting a car 😂
7:55 for a sec I thought it was Lauren Alexis
Shans mum is going to be so mad
Bangerrrr
imo she needs a new car chris for that
Plot Twist: This video was fake and the car wasn't real, and in probably a week Chris will upload a video like "I fOoLeD aLl Of My SuBsCrIbErS wItH a FaKe CaR"
2:14 could it be? No, surely not.
Lol wut I thought at the end he’d reveal that he bought her a new car (cos let’s be honest he could easily afford to do that) but no hahahah  Wow Chris what a caring boyfriend you are jeeez
"please dont leave meeeee"
The sad part is they had to pick up all that glass lol
Simon is too cold with it😂😂
I gotta say, this is probably my least favourite Chris video ever. Like, that somebody wil get the window to smash was obvious. Generally shooting on a car is completely unnecessary and stupid imo, especially if it isn't even your own like the title *and* thumbnail suggests. That's a dislike for me.
Simon smashed it 😂😂😂
*as
Chris treats Shan's FIAT 500 like what the old Top Gear crew did to Morris Marinas.
😂😂 best video haha
Hopefully you cleaned up that glass on the floor as well. Could be dangerous for kids
I like how you decided it was a good idea to film her reacting to the footage and then also laugh at her face when she is sad about her car
8:06 The sound was incredibly satisfying.
Best video you’ve made mate, fucking class, loved it
All this and he hasn't even gotten a 10 minute video out of it
"Please don’t leave me “ 😂
I nearly had a seizure reading that title wtf 😂😂😂
Chris came up with an idea for a video and used his gf car and thought it was fair. Then the lads just bullied him and completely destroyed the window. He got bullied into re directing his own video😂😂😂
well at this point this is just embarassing
done. It is not serious but I looked at Chriss's dms: *uniid.lol* poor girlfriend, I hope it changes Chriss not talking to himself is actually weirder than him being alone
By the way why is your bathroom door always open??😏
this video is a massive banger sorry for chris's gf lol
Theo was actually jokes 🤣
chris was given the choice between this and being in the haircut video
Literally one of his best videos
That slow walk Simon does right after he smashes the window is so badass. Especially with the cheering and the videos of people celebrating takes it to another level. I had to watch it back about 30 times!  Sorry about the car though....
Where did Simon get his hoodie from??? It looks sick. Does someone’s know??
Well I think we know what’s gonna be in simons next Reddit video 🤣🤣
Shannons reaction was priceless and then how chris said pls dont leave me alsolutely priceless
Maybe Chris should just put Ollie’s car in the goal when Ollie is in a vid and he might save something
dont know what is more funny the fact that shannon is probs thinking "im leaving" but chris still says "dont leave me"...lmao
Should have got fatneek in the vid chris
Lots of dents, a broken window and genuine tears... Shannon deserves a new car I reckon.
Simon is legendary for breaking the glass
2:15 WHAT⁉️⁉️
Here before 6 mil views
So now Sharon dosent like Simon 😂
Chris saying please don’t leave me was jokes 😂😂
Man, I love Simon Miniminter.
Hahahehehe pls don’t leave me 😭 xD
Chris looking at the window thinking to himself  “I should’ve done a fifa pack opening”
next up on Chris' channel: My girlfriend left me because I smashed her best friend...
'TIME TO SMASH IT'
I Do trust Chris any more because of the photo shop I was fooled by it on Instagram
Feeling happy with this and the Arsenal north London derby win
The clickbait is unreal
Simon and Shannon face's at the end ahahaha
done. It is not serious but I looked at Chriss's dms: *uniid.lol* poor girlfriend, I hope it changes Chriss not talking to himself is actually weirder than him being alone
Shoutout Chris for taking this bullying for content
Chris uploading twice In a week. ME: I must be dreaming
Well, if they break up, it's Simon's fault now
The guys: aim for the car and miss 8 year old me playing in the streets: snipes the car from my back garden
Chris is just meeting w every1 finally like sidemen and that
all that glass on the field.. XDDDDDDD
the "please dont leave me" fkin got me
I actually felt so bad for her though.
"Please dont leave me" he says while laughing at his gf crying
R8 in the thumbnail Fiat in the video Nice
Re name the title :    I let miniminter smash my girlfriends window
When you know you have too much money
Probably my newest favourite video
I think that this is the first video that Chris has cussed in
I love how Simon doesn't know how to feel
Run the ac or heat make sure there’s no glass in the vents
Chris should have just let them all hit it
There's no better night than watching ChrisMD
Miniminter's next video is gonna be him buying her a new car
first time Chris has ever uploaded more than once in a week
Shit version of the sidemen
bruhh bangin vid. very old school chris vibes, loved it
chris fr said “don’t leave me” to Shannon😭😂
Next person to play keeper will be scared... Mentally and physically
This cool
Theo is honestly one of the most underrated youtubers in the uk scene. if he did some other types of videos rather than fifa. then i reckon his channel would bang cause he's jokes
Harry: the most Chrismd video ive ever seen in my life Everyone else: nodding heads enthusiastically 😂😂
Bruno penandes be like: 3:27
Chris you gotta be careful mate
So cute watching Chris using ‘Sidemen’ for clickbait
What have we learnt don’t let the sideman near a car
PLEASE DONT LEAVE ME 😂😂
next video, buying my girlfriend a new car
Lol her reaction was funny I felt sorry for her
He probably fake it
Love your videos
Freezys shorts😂
done. It is not serious but I looked at Chriss's dms: *uniid.lol* poor girlfriend, I hope it changes Chriss not talking to himself is actually weirder than him being alone
Your cat should’ve been the keeper
Jeez that Simon free hit though
i thought my man was gonna surprise her with a new car but he just got it fixed lmao
Love the content!
Course it was fucking Simon XD Beautiful shot though
Hopefully this is better than the sidemen Sunday
Class
No
“Simon do it for Carly 🤣🤣”
You’ve got to buy her a whole new car for that violation 😂
anyone else not watched chris in almost a year but saw this title and said why not? damn he brings back memories
chris: *laughing* also chris: pLeAsE dOnT lEaVe mE
"Please don't leave me" Using beta male voice generator  aka teenage boy going through puberty
The memes used on this vid was perfect 😂😂😂
Chris: Please don't leave me That Broke me 😂😂

Props to Chris for killing the uploads lately

“Please don’t leave me” LMAOOOOO
2 videos in a week?    *Impossible*
Great video chris
I hope he does more vids wit these
LMFAOOOOO Chris “ please don’t leave me “
Chris could have at least dropped Shannon’s YouTube link in the description or the pinned comment. For her troubles - and domestic peace,
Such a video
Hahaha amazing video
Next video title   We broke up NOT CLICKBAIT!!!
Shann reaction...... So much.......
8:14 chris when arsenal won against tottenham

Well done Chris, now lots of kids are going to go outside and use their mums car as target practice 😂
daily reminder that harry won the iphone 12 in the last vid
I’m surprised Chris has uploaded 4 times in the last month. Amazing!!
Only People who didn't come from TikTok are worthy of liking this video.
The trim's in the gulag Chris
Next video my girl freind left me
Was it even Chris’s car I thought it was shannons
YouTube: 2 views YouTube: 156 comments and 664 likes Me: confoosion

As someone who's yet to own a car, it pains me to see this.
Bye bye car
Simon always hits everything no matter what.
Not sure whether to believe this after that one week of instagram 🤔🤔🤔🤔
RIP car
An upload in a week wow
Great vid
Why are they shooting right behind a glass building? Especially if they're doing it at max power.
Baited
I hope you are all having a good day
Loving the vids with Sidemen members Chris 😂👀. Perfect to watch on a Sunday night with school tomorrow

How the fuck have people liked the video it just came out
That's a car?
Hi
Love u Chris
Pin me Now
This group is better than the sidemen🤣🤣
Collab we didn’t know we needed
it’s a fiat 500, it was publicly executed off the factory line...
Literally spoiled who wins by showing Simon kicking alone in the first 5 seconds??
Me : clicks on the video    Also me: knows it’s gonna be a banger
3rd view, not even on notifications
Poor Shannon her car just got pelted and her car window smashed by some of the Sidemen and Theo Baker without her permission lol

Hmm... That’s odd, Chris uploads twice in less than 2 or 3 days!
Banger of a video 🔥

Chris taking every opportunity to put the Sidemen in his video titles lately
