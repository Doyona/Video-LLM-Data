You’re an influencer! Keep being genuine and follow your instincts!  Silva method is a good way to do that 🥰. And remember, it’s all Who you’re with!
You’re so pretty!
Okay... since when did YouTube become the defacto hot spot for x-sorority girls to whine & complain that girls are mean?! Like NO shit! They're also tribal AF, possessive, easily influenced, & hyper-superficial!   I'm genuinely sorry if your sorority experience didn't work out the way you'd hoped but come on! Let's be real, there's plenty of worse things in life!  I'm also sorry that nobody told you the most likely reason it didn't work is because you're different & being different than a bunch of pretty petty privileged white girls perpetuating the norms of an outdated social club is a good kind of different to be! You should probably run with it!  It's truly amazing how many of these "educational" sharing vids devolve into personalized therapy bitch sessions that can go on for an hour or more.  Between guys & girls combined, I've never seen an athlete (or wannabe athlete) post a video crying about the fact they didn't make the team, but a privileged tone-deaf self obsessed former sorority chick who thinks the Sun rises & sets in their own asshole, that's another story. If you truly wanna educate & influence future candidates? If you can't fit it into a 10-15 minute vid... you're rambling & getting too personal about drama nobody could possibly care about but you.
I always found it interesting that there was always a group of people that thought they were better than everyone and considered the “cool” kids or the “cool” group. Yeah, I don’t think so. I didn’t have limitations on who I could be friends with. I had friends from all walks of life. ❤
My only take away from this is the extreme privilege to be able to say out loud I thought I'd get in because of my last name
Thanks for sharing. All of this sounds like highschool level drama. Don't make something silly like this such a big thing in your head that you're literally falling apart because the "cool" sorority/house doesn't want you. I'm in Northern Europe and things are different here. I never joined a "student society" (sounds roughly the equivalent to fraternity/sorority, although in addition to the pretentious/obnoxious ones that are all about drinking and partying we also have many that revolve around sports or arts and culture etc). I made my own friends at uni and in my city's nightlife. I can see some value to joining a society of sorts but the ones that are all about being popular etc seem horrible. Don't give anyone power over your emotions like that.
I'm a dad and researching the subject because my daughter is starting college and wants to join a sorority...I never liked sororities or fraternities, I think it's for low self-esteem individuals who need to belong to something...
I honestly never watched anything Alix, just seeing celebrity-related posts. It was refreshing hearing how real she is. 💕
I worked with the Greek system on the national level early in my career. A lot of girls will get dropped for reasons entirely outside of personality/vibe. A house (or the houses' alum) may decide for a given year, given the applicants they have they will suddenly just drop all girls below a certain high school GPA, etc.
the American system is so crazy.. like you're supposed to be going to uni to educate yourself, not being the most popular girl.
Rush in and of itself is a process of elimination. Not sure what the mystery is there. Alix was humbled which is never an easy experience. It has given her a different, more healthy experience. I know for a fact the girls in the top row sororities aren’t all stereotypical. Actually, most aren’t. Most are hard working college students just like everyone else who happen to belong to a club that keeps them very active and teaches them so many life skills.  For the record…I was not in a sorority.
Your friend looks the same as your stepmom. The nose especially!
Omg that Shakira impression 💀💀
Have you ever considered the fact thay you're actually too good for those 2 shallow sororities?
I do truly feel like you went through that to share with girls who thought the same as you
I love this mix of a vlog, grwm, skin care and storytime podcast ❤  Literally the best
Humble, beautiful, kind and famous  Love you ❤
And now you’re a successful influencer worldwide 😂❤
Greek life at The U has always been a joke. It was a joke when I was there, it was a joke when Alix was there, and it’s likely the same way today. One of the best things about Miami is the fact that Greeks don’t run the social scene. I had a wonderful time without them and was able to make lifelong friends, friends I didn’t  pay for.   Alix, you didn’t miss anything, AT ALL.
Omg .. what were 10 yrs old?  Go find some real organic friendships
I went back to my Alma Mater last fall to see a play at Michigan State. Twenty-fiv 23:09 e years ago, I did not rush. I ended up becoming President of the student government and doing some cool things. When my Mom and I went to see this play, it was rush day 3 or 4, and we stopped at a coffee shop before driving home. My Mom didn't come out of the bathroom so I went to check on her. She was consoling all these girls, they were crying, giving pep talks, and free hugs. I started to do the same. It was a strange experience because the girls thought their lives were over.
I didn’t get picked for a sorority and seeing this video pop up is the first time I’ve thought about that in years. I’m glad you’re reminding people that it’s really not that deep
I had my ovary flip because of a cyst, the pain is unreal, ovary flipping = Emergency surgery 🚨🚨🚨 Please don’t play with these they can change your life.
A part of me feels like if she made the “cool” sorority, her tune would be different. We do what we need to in order to feel better about things. Human nature.
51:33 stooppp I had a guy say the SAME THING to me! I was 18 at a party in the Hollywood hills and some dbag said, “you’re cute, but you’d be hotter if you had some tits” 😧 I couldn’t believe my ears smh. I bet these are the same guys with tiny 🍆s. Btw total boss move getting that guy back, you’re hilarious 😂
I kinda wonder if they saw you as competition 🤔. Sororities are so stuck up & superficial anyway, you’re too down to earth for that ❤
I think sororities are so toxic 😮
Other than being hot, why are people interested in Alix?
Did you ever ask your cousin why she didn't save you? I imagine it ruined your relationship.
that’s the whole thing with sorority’s. They are all about “inclusion” unless your not in there sorority.
Your nightmare ?? Sounds like the feeling was mutual. If you were also telling stories about  hanging out with celebrities/ athletes, VIP & club vibes m,  drunk pumping near misses, Taco Bell  while giggling like it’s your first time and is clearly still what you do, enjoy, and want to known for; but while  also claiming to be so down to earth and humble and boring. A good group of girls is better than fashion week then going to fashion week all over the world this and last year. So yeah- if that was the you presented to the sorority + them having to know who step mommy is …. Why would you think you would be in. kind of an easy pass, right? But I guess everybody has to create challenges for themselves and a rich, white, healthy, beautiful blonde girls  is one of the most prolific in creating problems and drama for themselves to make Life harder for them out of boredom, selfishness, and attention. So go off.  But social media influencing and various ways to know the career value their impact on marketing, etc., is turning out to be the worst and hardest to endure unit of this course. And it’s summer grad course so packed. I’ve watched and edited endless blonde injectable faced vapid yapping girlies. It’s all the same. Planning to be down to earth and humble the occasional host showing their version of “look I’m just like you “well most of the time being just that vid seen girls always there always in the room, always chilling something and always being used by someone higher on the tiers of influence they assign each other.  Now that’s a legit complaint. I didn’t get the prof I wanted and stuck with a capitalist self hating woman waiting  to be trad wifed up
I love you for sharing this, Alix❤ also - men your opinion and input on sororities are not needed😑
I never saw the appeal of the Greek system.  It's like buying "friends."
You're probably too popular. Envy is a thing.
When I went through rush my top picks dropped me halfway through. I was disappointed but I didn’t know anyone at school yet and I wanted to stick it out to make friends. The sorority that I had written off early on, heavily pursued me during rush. They were so friendly and I felt relaxed being there. The house’s reputation was probably just like the “nice friend” and I really wanted to join a party house or a popular house. When it came time to decide I joined the nice girls house thinking I don’t care if this makes me a loser, I feel like myself here. When bid day came I found out then that 12 other girls from my rush group also joined the same house I did. Each rush group is approx 30 girls from your dorm so I instantly had a huge group of friends before freshman year even started. I’m so glad I didn’t give up and saw it through!
Getting cut from the sorority you want sucks. Worst part is, you'll never know why. It can be as dumb as you don't look like them or your folks don't make enough $$$. Yes, it sucks, not fair and you wish what could've been.  But the sooner you accept that the fact its not fair and you'll never know why, the better.  Because getting cut from your top sorority is just a dress rehearsal for other bigger, disappointments in life.   Specifically, the dream house you placed an offer on. Or, the dream job that you interviewed that you know is perfect for you.  Your crushed when you don't get either one. And the silly reasons could be the jobs already been filled, a worker used to be in a rival sorority or the sellers thought you were asking too much, etc.  You'll never know. But the stakes are higher. Best thing is to accept it sucks, not fair and have the mindset of "this or better".  😊
The three “top” sororities at my school had the highest dropout rates (from girls who joined) because of how toxic they were. And a lot of girls in those sororities wouldn’t even acknowledge half of their “sisters” in passing because of how cliquey and catty they were towards each other.
The crazy thing is some of the girls who make a really big deal about getting into a sorority or only active for one year. By their Junior or senior year they only do the things that are absolutely required.  I do think that it's wise to have Rush after you've been on campus for a semester so maybe you can actually learn something about how the sororities really are on campus but I guess that may not really change the outcome.
I always wanted to be in one
hi i love you
I truly believe that these sorioties are demonic. These sororities make the people who join compromise every moral in their life. They make you embarrass yourself, they peer pressure you to do things. I truly believe the wooziness Alix  felt day one was totally witchcraft. However, to enourage anyone here… let me tell you that you are loved by a God who sent his son to die for you. To come into this world and bear every pain, guilt, shame and torment you have experienced. Don’t compromise or lose yourself to such friend groups & sororities. Seek the kingdom of God and everything else will be added. ❤  Also I want to shoutout to  Alix and let you know that God cares for you and I believe you escaped some serious compromise with the first sorority your friends were in. Though it looked and felt as if you missed out. I believe you dogged a huge bullet. So Alix believe and Trust that God will lead you, and He will and ALWAYS HAS LOVED YOU! ❤
Wouldn’t your cousin save you?
21:14 love this❤
in a sorority its important to be cute but you'll have problems if your stunning
I literally went through this same experience at a different school
Alix is such a role model💜💜
Same thing happened to me
i’m going through rush and this is so helpful 🥹🤍🤍
I love your podcast so much!❤
recruitment was the worst. this makes me feel validated because i was dropped by my favorite houses too. good to know i am more like alix earle haha
How did Alix meet Braxton Berrios.
Was than man who took you to hospital Braxton?
This is the perfect date night. He stayed without complaint and supported you. He sounds like a keeper
I recently had 3 huge dermoid cysts and had them removed by c section along with an ovary and tube that were damaged by them. Im currently in recovery so hearing you talk about this made me feel less alone🤍🤍It can be such a scary experience and I never knew how common they are. I hope yours disappears. Hugs! Xox
Ur amazing!! The lesson was the gift… you are so talented and relatable and charismatic and this experience really is a great influential story so thank you for sharing :-)
“should i do my Shakira impression” “starts singing” 😂😂 why is she me 😂😂
my mom & sister both have multiple ovarian cists & apparently it’s like super common so i’m scared i have it & i have been WAY too scared to get it checked because i don’t want to have it & have it be a problem idk but yeah just letting you know it’s super normal i’m also super scared to get it checked out because my mom had a really hard time having kids & my period is like how hers was growing up so i’m just terrified of having the same thing happen to me
Do Americans go to college to study?
That Shakira impersonation thou
imagine being in the military in the late 90s and early 2000s. the initiations depending on your job are a completely different animal especially with branches like the marine corps. we were crazy in the navy too but this stuff i hear about what some of these frats do nowadays there would be carnage. there are lines you do not cross and we for the most part didn't play that game.
I was on the opposite side of this. Got in the popular sorority with all my friends and it ended up being a sht show. Dropped after second semester and I’m still friends with the nice ones and I’ve never been better ‼️
Honestly this is unrelatable for non rich girls, my worries in school were is my tuition gonna be paid for not what group did I get into with my friends
Do you have PCOS? Or was this a one off thing?
when you said covid and freshman year i was like hold the phone... this whole time I thought we were only a few months in age apart hahahah! Me three years older lol rip
What are sororities? And the “houses” & do you have to join them or is it optional? (I’m not American idk what’s going on 😂)
Sororities are a popularity contest, that's why it's so traumatizing.
The theme music reminds me of White Lotus
I hope you don’t talk to the cousin lmfao
“Comparison is the thief of joy” couldn’t be more real. Glad the universe sent you these girls when you needed them most ✌🏼
I went to a very small engineering school in Michigan, with 2 sororities and 11 fraternities. I rushed my first semester (transfer student), and received a bid from the one I had no friends in. However, I did end up joining because I didn’t make grades (yay Organic Chemistry!). While I was upset originally, my 4 years were great and ended up having amazing friends in both houses, including many girls who dropped their sororities, and tons of friends in many of the fraternities. One of my best friends was active in her sorority and (like many of my sorority friends) HATED the drama and recruitment requirements.  Being a GDI (god-damned independent) is 10000% ok, and many times, you have so much more freedom to do what you want and hang out with who you want.
Omg girl. Thank you for this. We have the same brain lol. I decided to rush and try it out because I really wanted to make friends. I went into it open-minded, but then quickly realized which sorority was the “cool” one with the cool, pretty girls. And yes, I went from the open-minded to the shallow route and really wanted to be in that sorority because I wanted to be in the “best” one. I talked to that one and thought we got along wonderfully. Then legit the second day they dropped me 💀 It was soooo hard to keep going through the process but I did and ended up at a house. I’m debating dropping as well because I don’t think this is for me. But I agree, I prayed that I would end up where I needed to be and I think if I had ended up in the “cool” sorority, a lot of my values may have changed. I mean, even during rush I was only thinking about how I should appear to impress THEM, what I should act like, and I feel like I could have totally lost myself. I’m glad I’m not the only one that went through this, it really does take more of a toll than you think it would and it feels like the world is ending in the moment 💀 but there’s so much more to life than being in a sorority
I just stumbled upon this. Thank you for being so vulnerable about your sorority experience
Same girly I was so heartbroken, but time tells rejection is redirection
Great stories and no disrespect, but your mom, wow. 🔥🔥🔥
Im about  to have my second surgery for my ovarian cyst. I have 3 scars on my tummy about to have 6,  the surgery itself doesnt take long whatsoever. It hurts the most when you're healing but after about 2 weeks you're fine.
this has to be the best podcast i've seen
I loved this so much, it’s like a vlog but still a podcast, 10/10 babe love u
This is interesting, I met a lot of frats and sorority girls too im in a New Mexico college, I have gotten told by these people female and male im to kind and need to be more (bitchy) (no one wanted to be my friend) I even go out of my way to ask every person since now Snapchat college group stories to ask no one in these colleges especially frat guys and sorority girls all i wanted is a friend and i get told to my face i need to grow out my hair, because i never even drank in highschool or partied, these girls are some of the worst people in the world they are horrible unkind humans and just want people to clones of each other. I have seen pervious baby sitters as a little girl they were sorority people in (ZTA)  and i noticed the now older people (graduated )the ones that stayed in soroities are still bitchy to this day almost in their 30s now they have gotten no where in life and have a job in Nursing for example and havent moved out of this lame ass state doing nothing. IF you were straight up alone and bullied throughout out all years of school the sorority people will prob go nowhere in life a majority of them. They are not special.
I’ve never seen a podcast of someone just telling their life story. Can’t believe so many ppl wanna listen but hey🤷‍♂️ enjoy
Berk, all that plastic surgery at her age. It's ridiculous. It makes her look banal and narcissistic with a close look of a goldfish. Nowadays, the more plastic one has, the more "beautiful," he/she is.
I absolutely love the podcast!! I love the inside commentary and opinions on life experiences ....very good
Dis some real shit
I’m really glad you opened up about the cyst. I’m going through a similar situation and it can be very painful some days
Nice
Nyc
so glad you found people to welcome you… zlam !! 🫶🏼🤍
Viry nice
very nice
Her lips are pissing me off and I feel triggered
I'm so happy I'm from New Zealand and this doesn't exist
5:45 you look so much like ashtin in this pic i think bc you’re younger in it
I bet all the sororities r obsessed w her now
Ovarian cysts are awful. So sorry you had to experience one. They are caused from our hormone levels being thrown off and out of whack and our gut health. It can cause PCOS. Focus always on your tummy health and it will get better I promise 🤍
Chug pedialite?  How about "drink less."
Wow 😲
Super i like❤❤
The picture on your friends wall😂 hope you noticed
I don’t understand people being pick mes for friends
Honestly from the perspective of going to a uni in Germany where sororities do not exist the concept of sororities sounds insane 😂
The best podcast love love the layout, feels like one of your besties
And now you’re a baddie and those sororities are punching the air 🧚🏽‍♀️💅🏽
Awesome fantastic good 👍
Nice
Good
Honestly I never understood the point of sororities and fraternities. A lot of the individuals within these “societies” aren’t the nicest and it’s sad to see how sick some of these people get during rush.
nice
Nice
You are video it's very good
That Shakira impression *chefs kiss*
Great
Nice video
There is a lot to learn. Thank you.
You are an amazing human being....very good
Good
👍
For anybody reading this:  The biggest things to watch out for with ovarian cysts are torsion & internal bleeding.  Even if you think you can deal with the pain, don't let anybody discount it, because you need to go to the ER to check for these things.  If your cyst has torsion, it can cut off the blood flow to your ovary & cause it to die.  Just because it's a common problem in women, doesn't mean it's not serious!  This is not common knowledge, so just trying to spread the word (as a girl who has dealt with this a lot)!
Nice
Good
Good
Wow very very amazing
good
The problem was, you felt entitled
Wow so nice look
It's soo amazing😍👍
The girl putting her actual engagement ring on you is actually crazy lmao
Good
The way I feel so validated about being dropped by all the sororities in college because Alix was too😭
Everything happens for a reason, take everything as a lesson <3 had you got the sorority you originally wanted you could have very much been a shallow person like how you described :) You're a beautiful person
good video
Nice
Nice
Ever thought about the porn industry? ❤❤❤
Youre way to gorgeous to be crying ❤❤❤
This made me feel better knowing that I’m not the only one that struggles with drinking water. I’ve been doing better recently. It honestly gets easier after the first week.
I had an ovarian cyst too ! Had to get surgery when I was 11. It was legit the worst pain ever!! Also though it was my appendix
Nice
Very nice
Alix I would put all of my money n DOUBLE IT on the reason why they dropped you was bc they were jealous
not you feeling like you’re mooching when you’re prob their idol
why didn’t your COUSIN stand up for you?!?!!?!
Good
Absolute favorite podcast
I get terrible period pains but I thought it was normal but just today it got so bad I almost fainted on the train. I literally vomited 😭 i was shaking. But this happens often everytjme on my period  but this time was just worse. So idk if it’s a burst? I booked an appointment but Not sure if I should go ER instead
Amen I hate the small talk with a bunch of random people you will probably never talk to again. Always rather be with my group of best friends
Nice
Only a spoiled person would feel relieved during times such as Covid because she gets to hang out with her friend group again ... She is always trying to be relatable but all her issues are a joke compared to real issues of real people. The attempt to make the whole podcast feel more genuine because she is sitting in sweats on her bed fails so hard, wannabe Emma Chamberlain style :)
I can’t believe her mom said she spawned the devil lol 😭😭
went to UMiami too and all I can say is frats and sororities were easily the most
At the end of the day you are the Alix Earle. You didnt need them, you did it all without a sorority!
God had bigger plans for you! ❤
Same thing happened to me it’s a messed up system
as soon as i heard the pain you were having i knew exactly what it was, deadass the worst pain😭
Good
so pretty
Registered nurse here! I have had multiple cysts rupture myself, the pain is truly no joke! Just remember to take care of your body, they are usually harmless and can fluctuate with your hormonal cycle. Mine have since gone away and I've had no issues! Dietary triggers such as dairy can be a trigger for some girls and if you have cysts it can be really helpful to make sure you are taking good care of your body (stress/diet//alcohol intake/etc). Don't let a doc tell you that there is nothing that you can do to prevent them and don't stress yourself out too much <3
this is the type of girl young girls need as a rolemodel .. keep it up alix you’re doing amazing 💕
i bet you millions of dollars those sororities regretted their decision HA
Here from CHD and not disappointed
talking about NYFW is SO ON POINT. I haven't went as an influencer but i've worked NYFW and attended events and i always say its overhyped and i thought i was the only one lol!
i never got the hype or point of stressing about any of this bs
That’s exactly how i am, once i know something’s there medically I’m so anxious and overly aware. I hate it so much!
I get it! At the end of the day NYFW is to work & network sadly it’s not fun fun
I had one rupture last year! Mine wasn’t crazy pain, but I know others who have also gone to the ER from it. Prayers for your situation!❤
Girl thank you so much for being raw with us! It is so amazing of you! I spent about 2 and half months of my freshman year of high school dealing with a constant rupturing/growing cyst and the doctors could not figure it out what was going on for the longest time. Multiple ER visits, people thought I was faking it, I missed a ton of school, and didn’t figure out it was a cyst until the doctors did a surgery to see if I had this rare type of cancer (talk about scaring a 13 year old!). I’ve heard that all women have them, but only some cysts will cause pain. Thanks for sharing what you’ve learned because it taught me something new and definitely agree it should be discussed more!
1/4 of my thesis was on sorority pressures back in 2018. reminds me of ur vulnerability here XOXOXOOXO
your growth reminds me of me in college xoxo <3 this will help many girls and women. thank u <3
what a surprise.... the big girl with the nose from the tribe works for a new york financial institution.
Can you talk more about friendships.! One you fight for and ones you decide to end or let it run it’s course.!
WHAT WOULD ALIX DO- if she could go back and tell her past self some accutane advice?!? I’m struggling with getting through the treatment and need advice!!
what is this lip combo i need to know
honestly as a european i just don’t understand all the sorority hype/obsession thingy 😅 however, i’m glad everything turned out the way it did and you still had an amazing time and found great friends ❤
Love you so much Alix!!!
I went to UMiami too and all I can say is frats and sororities were easily the most superficial thing on campus. I didn’t get the frat I wanted either and I quickly watched nice girls get the individuality taken out of them as they joined their sororities. Next thing I knew, they were just clones of each other walking around campus. The fact that you could see through it and drop is such a rarity, and I have all the respect for you! Looking back 10 years later, it really isn’t all that it’s cracked up to be.
❤
Sorority rush destroyed my self esteem and confidence. It’s all about looks and material wealth in Florida universities.
Anyone else thinking how fucked up is this RUSH week, sorority and frat shit. It’s giving parading women in front of men and pinning women against women vibes. Maybe it’s just because I’m from the UK.
Is this video sponsored by Cheez Its?
You should have told that p00p00 big ego guy that “maybe if your ego was as small as my teets you could say No but at least I can get mine done 💁🏼‍♀️” xoxox love you Alix! Sincerely, itty bitty teetty committee member ;)
thank you alex. I had so many friends that had the same rush experience as you and would have felt so much better hearing this. So many girls rushing should hear this ❤️
favorite podcast actually ever
I think you are a very good story teller 😊❤
THE SHAKIRA IMPRESSION
I wish I had this podcast when I was in college
Just a thought: I think it would be even better if you had the mic hidden somehow either above you or attached to your clothes, it'll make it more chill vibes!
Retards
Girl I knoww cysts is sooo sore❤
this is the most wihney shit i have ever seen
❤❤❤❤
I hope my daughter one day gets this experience that my parents never let me have
loveee that you were so honest about the ovarian cyst. I had a huge one that ruptured, twisted and spread up to my chest. Unfortunately the only sign I was given was feeling like I couldn't breathe and having to be rushed to the hospital due to it. I had to get surgery, which took me about 6ish weeks to recover from. I went to my OBGYN a week before, and they told me everything was healthy and looked normal, but that just wasn't the case. I remember being so scared and I felt like no one else had it, since no one talks about it. So glad you're doing okay, and that you brought awareness to this 🤍
Ok but can we talk about the Shakira impression 😂😂😮‍💨
The shakira impression was spot on I was shook
Can we please get a g wagon tour
I want her to name drop the sororities so bad 😭🤣
#1 rule of living w girls. Say L e s s
Lowkey, I'm grateful I got dropped by my sorority lol
THE SHAKIRA??? IT WAS SO GOOD
Also it will flare up worse near your period time, so be careful
wish I could like this a million times
I am loling about the emergency room story😂😂😂 i love u so much glad u feel better 😘
why was the shakira impression spot on
SMH 🤦‍♂️ don’t pay for friends
What were the 2 main sororities she’s talking about? At UCSB it was alpha phi
please do a friendship advice episode
As someone who struggles with health anxiety to an extreme level, I totally sympathize with you.
The BUREAUCRATICS PROCEDURES to have a social life in the US depresses me. Anyway i love you Alix 🫶🏼
so real for the huge box of cheez itz
Her releasing this after fall rush 😣
I feel you on the cyst! At 32 I had a fibroid (benign tumor) the size of a premature baby. It was HUGE. Literally made me stop peeing, had to live with a catheter for 2 weeks and had a c-section to remove it. Scariest month of my life! So I feel you. But it’ll be ok! And unfortunately they can come back (I have a new fibroid yay!) but just make sure to monitor it and get check ups!
Crazy bc my man was right next to me in er in college for an ovarian cyst lmfao
First world problems
we had the exact same sorority experience happened to me, down to crying in the houses
So excited for this podcast! I’m here for it!!
all of my sisters have had ovarian cysts! Women need to talkkkkkkkk more
Alex, I am 30 and I listen to your because of who you are and your amazing energy. You are amazing and I wish you all the best girly! ❤️ love the podcast
Who the fuck sees someone in an ER and asks for a selfie?!
As a PCOS and endometriosis girly I feel the pain you felt girl
you made me feel so much more at peace with my sorority experience. your perspective is amazing.
Good video
Typical trash trending content
Pretty girl! You are sooooo well spoken & carry yourself like a  true classy beauty, BUT  are still so so relatable  & fun to watch! Very excited for you & you should be super stoked & proud of the life you've created for yourself. ❤ Keep on keeping on!  XOXO
And this overtook Joe rogan….. 🤦‍♂️
All the rejection she experienced is the same rejection people of color get on a daily basis all their lives. This is why we need to dissolve all these systemic traditions of oppression.
Alix is so genuine
American health system is really messed up. Like in Europe, Lithuania to be specific, doctors always perform an internal check for this exact reason. The fact that you’ve been to the gynecologist and they did not check it is really concerning…
i had an ovarian cyst on my left ovary and had to get emergency surgery! i know it’s stressful especially the pain of not knowing what it was
Cheater
The subtle #0
this podcast is great! i love all the different segments
Thanks for sharing about the cysts. I recently got diagnoses with endo and adenomyosis - had never heard of adeno before!! Apparently it's common, get tested adenomyosis.
I love the half podcast/ half vlog format!!! Ily ALIX!! 🫶🏻
Im a main character and people love hearing about me 😂😂😂 🤡
THE SHAKIRA IMPRESSION CAUGHT ME SO OFF GAURD
Natalie ended shakiras whole career with that😍🙏🏻
Omg I recently went through the same about with the ovarian cyst it was so painful it hurted to sit down and walk. I went to the ER as well and they told me the same thing. I started my cycle and I feel so much better.
Natalie must return
alix seems like the sweetest and funniest friend fr. also sorry about the ovarian cysts that’s so scary but ull be okay ❤❤
i love how Alix is driving her G Wagon w a podcast mic. Iconic.
yes queen
Alix! I was on accutane 4 times, i had the same type of acne you had BUT i  found out later, i had PCOS. they prescribed me spirolactone and i rarely see a pimple ever. please look into PCOS diagnosis because the cysts, acne, and everything. ❤ just thought i would share since i saw you were on accutane again and it always came back for me because it wasn’t fixing the root cause 😢
Whats the instrumental in the beginning ?
i love you so much al. you’re amazing. never resonated with an influencer so much. it feels like you’re my bestfriend and we’ve shared exactly the same experiences. thank you for being like an older sister … you’re so real, your life seems so perfect but you’re insanely relatable and so down to earth. love you!!!!
They def didn’t let you in to the sorority because they felt threatened by your beauty 🤣🤣
I’ve never really been that big of a fan of influencers but I really love Alix. She has had a very blessed life but she doesn’t act better than anyone and truly has a great heart. I would love to have a friend like her. Great job girl
Her mom is pure lol
I have the underlying thought but with fucking UTIS. I swear I can think one on myself
The #0 jersey at 47:00 😅😅😅😅
I love you so much!! But you seem a lot more comfortable around your friends! You should involve them way more in the podcast!
I love how smart this is like the style set up of it all I love the get unready with me I love the vlog style it makes podcasting so much better
Obsessed with the style of this podcast it’s like the best idea ever and the video makes it like I love way hign
YOU GUYS ARE TOO CUTE. I AM GLAD I CAME ACROSS THIS 🎉
I never thought Alix would be so normal and down to earth. She seems like such a sweet genuine girl
what's a sorority
I’m living for the Cheezits promo bc they are the Extra Toasty ones 😂👌🏼
That transition to nyc !!!
honestly this is one of the best podcasts ice ever watched. so entertaining omfg. we love alix earle.
🔥JOE ROGAN BETTER🔥
I’m glad you found out in time because I lost my left ovary because my ovarian cyst got really big and it twisted. Make sure you stay on top of it! Sending you good vibes!
Love how honest and real you are ❤
What is the premise of this show? Is this for kids or….
Let’s not talk about college anymore.
Alix Earle podcast #2 already! I’m loving it
Grow up. Do you have fun adult stories?
We don’t care about college hook ups anymore.
Alix- I love you but can you talk about more real things? You seem like such a teeny bopper. Ugh. Like we’re adult women now. Maybe your following is teens? But like grow a little maybe. Everyone is over college. We’re like grown now.
I ❤ you Alix this was so much fun
pedialite or gatorade (:
i love these. keep em coming
Well them sororities  FUMBLED YOU BIG TIME
Oh my God! 5 mins into this I dropped
THE SHAKIRA IMPRESSION
Alix basically just confirmed Greek life is just like the movies 😓
This hits sooo hard. Senior year of college I was on my way to a frat party when all of a sudden I was doubled over in pain thinking it was cramps and next thing I know I'm in the ER for a ruptured ovarian cyst. Had never heard of it before and was so confused but the pain is so unbearable and the weird anxiety it leaves you with after is just the worst. It feels so good hearing someone else talk about this!
I truly do not understand why your cousin didn't fight for you!
I’m so confused with the fascination of sororities. The vibes are always SO off.
We want a podcast with Xandra!
“ I told him that girls don’t poop “ 😂😂
Did cheez it sponsor this lol
Alix is so genuine it’s refreshing
shakira impression slayed
This is amazing
Asking u to take a pic in the emergency room is wild 😂
i feel like im on facetime with my best friend, i LOVE it
The #0 sitting next to her is everythingg thx braxton
the casual #0 in the background of what would Alix do 👏 love it
What are the top two sororities at umami ??
more natalie pls!!!!
Your cousin didn’t save you????😮
Sometimes ovarian cysts are just caused by pcos, so if you have other symptoms of that I would talk to obgyn also love ur new podcast I was never really on TikTok but I love YouTube so im so glad to get to watch these because all the girls talk about “what Alex Earle recommends etc”❤
the shakira impression tho
Y’all are staying the cheez it’z look staged but cheez itz literally sent her a pr package of like a million if those boxes😭😭
Big AL in the Big Apple hell yeah brother
Love the podcast, as a filmmaker, your 2 other cameras need to have different shots. One should be more of a close up and maybe one a wider shot. It’s weird how they’re all the same
Best thing I did was not rush honestly
wow this is crazy because i just went through this exact situation and i'm so so happy to hear how validating my decision was through your story. thank you alix you're amazing.
I literally love how real you are & appreciate you staying true to yourself <3 Excited for future uploads :)
I had the opposite experience I had a family friend help me get into delta gamma and but I really connected better with a different one. I went with the cool one and regretted it cause I felt a better connections with girls from the other one. Ended up dropping out!
preach Alix!! Ladies, it is not worth it being in the “cool” sororities on campus. I was in one and I did not end up keeping in touch with any girls from my sorority after college. I met all my genuine best friends outside of greek life. I always wish I didn’t get caught up in the status of the sorority because I think I would have had a better greek life experience being in a more chill sorority instead.
Your mom is so cute!!😂😂
people have the audacity to ask for a pic when yall are in the ER
i never was a fan of the sorority/frat culture it all seemed like a status thing and it’s not worth the mental and emotional abuse you go through because none of those people are a “defining moment” for the rest of your life. you can be a lit person on your own, and here you are now, a millionaire 🫰🏽
I work in broadcast media and I see professional personalities everyday and I can honestly say that Alix is super talented.  It’s a gift to be able to tell a compelling story.  Wow.
The Shakira impression was amamzinhgggg
I admire her for sharing this. I was too intimidated to even go through with rush.
I literally had same process and only lasted a year too at Arizona.
casually gets ur hair done by chris appleton
You are an amazing human being💜
Okay that impression of Shakira???? SPOT ON 💀💀
53:15 GOOD FOR YOU
49:04 ask them to spot you, or if they are using equipment. and to be silly goofy ask what they max out on and try to be competitive like oh “that’s me on a bad day”
first mistake was joining a sorority, it’s always mean girls and little cliques not the vibe 😅 so happy you actually found amazing girls on campus
47:07 it means you scored lululemons check the tag for how to wash it. finders keepers losers weepers
IGNORE THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS ALIX YOURE DOING GREAT I LOVE THIS PODCAST. YOU DO WHAT YOU ENJOY AND PEOPLE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO RUIN IT. YOURE AWESOME
I’m 30 now but your message about sororities is so healing. I wish I had someone say this to me during my rush experience 10 years ago. It was crushing to my self esteem and in the end it totally worked out the way it was meant to. I have lifelong friends from the dorms & found my people. But damn it was hard to face that rejection. It all seems so much bigger in the moment. Thank you for sharing your experience!! It was so validating to hear. 🩷
Natalie is hilarious LMAO
This exact same thing happened to me. I felt like I was hearing my own story.
Not the algorithm bringing me here after I finished watching this episode on Spotify once I open my YouTube 😅  Sorority girl unite ! Natalie’s impression of shakira is funny af! NFL man is the real mvp !  LOL@ The buying everyone 1942’s shots! Next Thursday can’t come soon enough❤
Natalie’s shakira impression??????? Incredible
Alex! I just want you to know that ovarian cysts are often from PCOS which is also strongly linked to acne! I think you’ve found the root cause of your acne
Thinking you have to transfer after not getting in is so ridiculous 😂
Loveee this 🎉
Alix, I was in one of the top sororities at my school and the girls were horrible… it was so cliquey & the girls were so mean. The grass isn’t always greener on the other side
She is so well spoken and beautiful!
so obsessed w natalies shakira impression
😍😍😍
that sorority is crying screaming DYING rn
The extra toasty cheezits… u get it
She’s so real for the extra toasty cheez its
I really love ur podcast! I especially like that you don’t gossip, always speak kindly about your friends, and have an overall positive attitude! I feel like I can hear about the mess and drama without the gossipy shit talking that other podcasts have.
Yess extra toasty! Ur hip !!
I feel like this is more sotry time youtube rather than a pod
this exact thing happened to me freshman year it destroyed my confidence and i became insecure and thought everyone’s first impression of me was i’m a weirdo or boring
Use castor oil pack on wool with heating pad - natural remedy to dissolve cysts (I was in hospital 4 days w a rupture one)
This was such an intriguing take on sororities. Btw idk if you’re into nyc vlogs but if so, you might like mine. Swing by, take a peek and stick around if you like. I’d be sooo grateful. 🙏
Coming from Arizona state, the sorority talk had me shook. I love watching u because your the only influencer who has ever lived in the same niche that’s just so unexplainable to the general public
went to university of tampa and rushed my sophomore year bc i missed it my freshmen year and I didn’t even make it past the first part where you meet all the sororities. i had outfits picked out that i never ended up getting to wear for it and our rho gam leader said we would all find our “home” and it will be amazing we are all so awesome, blah blah, said it would be highly unlikely you didn’t get into a house. i felt like i connected with a lot of the girls i spoke with and didn’t know anyone else that was asked to not come back like i was just after the initial first time meeting them all. safe to say it reinforced my insecurities about myself 🙃
i completely relate to this. sorority rushing doesn't seem that deep, but in the moment, you feel so insecure and defeated. i preffed my top and bottom house and opened my card on bid day to my bottom house and i was a mess! all of my friends got in our favorite sorority and i ended up declining the bid in front of everyone. as they're jumping up and down screaming of happiness,  i'm running back to my dorm with tears going down my face haha. definitely was a hot mess that day.
Natalie would be such a good cohost
Obsessed with this podcast!
Alix thank you for sharing!! This is huge and so many girls need to hear this! The fact that you went through something HUNDREDS of girls go through is so comforting! You are so amazing and this podcast is great!! ❤❤
the way i relate so much
Imagine the sororities now seeing her 😭
people are the worst to ask for a picture when your in the emergency room like time and place
so glad Greek life was never that serious for me lmao
A girls girl 🤍
Obsessed with Natalie always 😂
I felt the same way when I had a ovarian cyst rupture, I almost passed out at work, my ears were ringing, I was so pale and in the worst pain of my life I couldn’t even sit down. Loved episode 2 Alix :)
I was in a sorority at UM a decade ago and I knew exactly who and what you were talking about immediately 😂
appreciate how open you are! <3
I absolutely love the podcast!! I love the inside commentary and opinions on life experiences 🤍🤍
Pls make an episode on friendships. That’s a whole can of worms lmao
Girl I had an ovarian cyst rupture and it feels like giving birth like soooo painful my brother raced me to the ER still the worst pain I’ve ever felt lol
Mouth sweats are the worst
I loooove her!! She seems like such a lovely person and somehow maintains her relatability despite her insane success. I think she’s a much better role model than who has previously been marketed to the public as ‘the it girl.’ But was anyone else hoping the Earle family would take over reality TV similar to KUWTK early days?! Like what the D’Amelio family tried to do. Her overnight international rise to fame is comparable to Kim’s (despite totally different origin stories.) She seems a little uncomfortable / it feels quite staged which is the opposite of what her fans love her for. Every influencer has a podcast, she is one of the few who could break through to reality TV and dominate. Either way she’s only a few weeks into this so I’m sure she will find her pace & I’ll definitely be watching!
SO IS ALIX STILL IN COLLAGE??????? OR WHAT????? lol
WHY DONT U DO SOMETHING TO CHANGE HOW THE SORORITY THING GOES THEN IF ITS SOOO HORRIBLE LOL THEN MAKE A CHANGE!!!!!!! SO GIRLS DONT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SAME THINGS U DID!!!!!!
Is anyone asking, why didn’t her cousin in the sorority she wanted save her?
I feel like it's always worse when there is someone you know in the house because they know everythingggg about you
In Canada at western, we have the same thing and it was honestly the worst feeling ever getting dropped. 4 years later, so happy to see where I grew as a person without it 🎉❤
Im off TikTok rn and the only thing ive been missing is your content 🙈🧡 thank god u have a podcast now bc i could listen to u speak FOREVER!!!!!
idk why but I love when people with a lot of money still realize something is expensive and don‘t act like it‘s nothing 😂 love u alix 🤎
Not rushing was the best decision I made in college and I went to U of I when it had the largest Greek system in the country- the friends I made were all in different houses so I got to go to everything! And the only houses that are strict about who can and can’t attend stuff are the “top houses” which are not fun to party with anyway
I think I'm too old to be on the "Alix Earle effect" train 😂  But oh well 🤷🏼‍♀️ my old millennial mama ass will still be living vicariously through this beautiful soul and all her hilarious life adventures! 💙
I had a cyst in my right ovary rupture in August and I have never felt more validated. I went to the ER thinking my appendix burst and I felt so guilty because I didn’t want people to think I was lying about the pain. I had the same tests and they kept me overnight. Hearing someone else have this feels so good. Like it’s not a good thing, but I feel validated
i had an ovarian torsion at 9! medical mystery😎 i did lose the ovary tho
I love this podcast so much! I really like how it’s produced
This made me happy today
As soon as you started describing the symptoms you were feeling/going through my mind immediately thought “ovarian cyst ruptured” because G I R L. this has happened to me TWICE. So embarrassing but mine ruptured in the middle of……yeah 😅 with my boyfriend at the time and I jumped off the bed and fell to the ground, was crouched over, couldn’t move, bloated, & he carried me to a hot shower. He was so scared for me too, but was so sweet trying to help me. Ugh the worst pain in the world!! I didn’t realize how common it was with women either until I went to the OBGYN. Thankfully I didn’t have to get surgery for either of them, but I’m glad you talked about this because you’re right, it’s so common but it is not talked about.   I’m not on BC and one doctor told me taking birth control is like a preventive, but I’m not sure how fact that is. I sound dumb questioning an actual professional but yeah. 😭 Glad you figured it out, and you’re ok, and that you talked about this!! ❤
Holy SHIT NATALIE is SHAKIRA - mind absolutely blown 😳
Tbh I wish this pod wasn’t once a week but I get it.. I just need it more 😂😩
loveddd this ep
doctor here - lots of women have cysts on their ovaries. sometimes you can have a cyst rupture which occurs mid cycle and some women dont get pain and others might get mild to severe pain when it ruptures depending on the size of the cyst... most of the time when the cyst ruptures doctors dont do anything unless it was so big that the fluid in the belly is causing pain.  if the cyst doesn't rupture it makes the ovary heavier which puts it at risk of twisting on its axis - called torsion. ovarian torsion is an emergency because if it stays twisted, you cut off supply to your ovary which causes it to die - and it needs to be removed sometimes it will twist, then untwist then twist again etc... so it might cause intermittent sporadic pain hope everything works out!
Wow, it's very impressive to me how American culture is all about 'self-promotion' all the time and having to please 'to be chosen'... to hell with it!!!! How exhausting 🫣
UK unis are so chilled compared to American unis
Dying to know the house her cousin was in
I’ve had an ovarian cyst too! You’re not alone ❤️❤️❤️praying for you b🩷💕
“The doctor’s asking me if I’m going to shit my pants” 😂😂
America is so strange
👏👏 this is such an important message about the sorority and recruitment process-- thank you for sharing, Alix!👏👏
1 hour podcast of alix??  Say less, my popcorn are ready 🫶🏼
I love this!!
❤❤❤
ur the best!! obsessed 💓💓
Natalie's Shakira impression was more like Maya Rudolph doing Shakira which is even funnier tbh 😂
what a role model 🤍I respect people even more when they can address taboo subjects. It’s okay not to be okay in the moment but she’s also saying it’s ok to take a different path instead of trying so hard to make something work. I’m invested in this podcast 🫶🏽
my experience with greek life was soooo similar
i already know im gon be obsessed with this podcast, i just wish alix was more comfortable and relaxed. i feel like even tho shes on her bed, everything screams big production team and fake messy setup. i would absolutely love this if the vibes were more like emma chamberlain's podcast.
❤
Been waiting for this oneee
Love you Alix ❤
literally in love with this podcast
as someone who's currently rushing, this is so comforting rn
