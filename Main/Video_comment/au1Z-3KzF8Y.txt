To whoever is reading this Jesus loves you and he’s coming soon. All you need to do to be saved is believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins was buried and came back to life on the 3d day confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and you’ll be saved. Today is the day of salvation tomorrow is not promised and you don’t want to miss the rapture it will be so bad like nothing ever seen before on earth. God bless!

Pro-tip: decorate the gingerbread walls and roofs BEFORE assembling. Way easier to decorate than trying to with them upright. Icing and candy won’t slide down if assembling the walls and roof laying flat on the table.
shay's biggest flex "shooting a movie w Jennifer anniston"
trevor noah could get it, you're not wrong
The face of the dog like: the humans are so stranger 🐶 lol
Okay that was really entertaining 😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤
this whole video was the funniest video i have ever seen it made my day
This was soooo great 😂😂 it’s Shay being drunk at the end and them smashing each other gingerbread houses for me

I love how comfortable they are w each other. Not just Ian and shay but like Tyler and Ashley too. Just like you can tell most of the cast probs still talk to each other and I love that.
This is soo wholesome to see some of the cast interact with each other 🥺 also this video was hilarious 😂😂😂

couldn’t do this over zoom? no? ok.
OKAY BRB GONNA GO WATCH PLL
MY NEW FAVORITE VIDEO 😭
JESUS IS COMING SO SO SOON Y’ALL! Repent and trust in Jesus alone! Lemme know how I can pray for you :)    God created the world good and perfect, but we as humans have rebelled against that by sinning. Every single one of us has sinned. And just like on earth te here’s punishment for breaking the law, so there’s punishment for breaking God’s law: death and eternal separation in hell. BUT HERE’S THE GOOD NEWS: out of God’s deep and unconditional love for us, He sent His one and only son to take that punishment. Jesus is eternal and never committed any sin, He is 100% God and 100% man, and He just loves you ever so much. He paid the price IN FULL for our sins, so that we don’t have to. We owed a debt to God and Jesus paid it. And He rose 3 days later proving His sacrifice was accepted. Now all you have to do, is repent and trust in Jesus alone!     God is so good! He has pulled me out of the darkest place, and sharing the good news of the Gospel is in the hopes that He can help someone else too :)
LOL i just knew them as ezra fitz and emily field HAHAHHAH
Mr. Fitz and em hangs out a lot makes aria out of picture
Dude I'm so jealous 3 days from Christmas and me and my family of 4 our stuck a camper with no tree or anything really I think were probably going to go out eat or grill lol, but this looks really thanx for uploading 🥰❤❤ and merry Christmas to you all 🎁🎄❤🥰

HOPE 💫 Salvation is found in no one else, no other name under heaven given among men where by we must be saved. Saved from the punishment of sin. I’m trying to offer people Hope in absolute perfection !!! No more pain, dying, lies, decay, depression, anxiety, crying, sickness, rotten food, broken things , etc... offering the Hope of Eternity in heaven with Jesus Christ. We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness. And to know and live out his teachings. He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1 John 2:17  Visual Bible movies on YouTube !!!   ❤️💫🇺🇸🤍💫🇺🇸💙💫🇺🇸 🙂
Merry Xmas. This is how we spread some festive cheer here in Australia. https://youtu.be/7WD4ZSfgJJg

Shay looking at her house: Ian:Thank you for being interested Shay
I MISS U GUYS
I just love still seeing the cast together. 50’years from now when they old as dirt I’ll still just love seeing them in the same room. Iconic cast for a truly iconic show.
Ownn my babys
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Shay- “Kill: Arias dad because he cheated” Also Shay- “F*ck: Spencer’s Dad”  Me: Spencer’s Dad had multiple kids from multiple women while being married......  I miss Pll😢
Man ian is just hilarious 🤣🤣🤣💗💗💗
Ian is still a creepy lying teacher to me who stalked a group of girls for a book. So it’s weird seeing him as an actual human being who is just an actor and actual pretty close in age to the girls
Best duo lol!
Only a psychopath wouldn’t laugh at this video it’s amazing 😂😂
Ngl kinda sad they didn’t call Lucy
Can we please get a shay and Ian show!!! Maybe weekly videos !!!!  😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
“i was so put off by your double jointed middle finger” i cnattttsyufisjfi
'we need you to tell us who did a bender... better job' was the exact honesty we needed 😂. Also, Ian and Shay destroying things that are edible would be a show I'd def watch ❤️
I love this cast so much
I miss pretty little liars shay I love u and can u do a video when the covid is over do a youtube video with all the cast members of pretty little liars
"It's supposed to symbolize 2020"  I get dude
It makes me so happy to see, how close the pll cast is
Oh my god, I absolutely loved this hahaha! You need to be under the influence in more videos, it's hilarious <3 xxxx
That middle flip was everything lol
I want those drinks and don’t kill holly I’d be very sad
Not going to lie this is the best YouTube video I’ve seen in a while I miss PLL 🥺
Her manners remind me Kyle Jenner
i love that u guys are still friends 💙
AHHHHH
Can someone please please tell me when did Emily kissed Hanna like that like which episode please tell me I’m confused
Ian is wearing a ring on his ring finger..hmmmm
I think they should try BABY FOOD TOGETHER

It would be so cute and hilarious if Ian did a babysitting challenge with atlas, I can already see how awkward he would be😂😂❤️
OMFG THIS VIDEO SAVE MY 2020

Shay you should try and get Lucy on your channel
Não entendi uma palavra,mas coprinedi.  Mentira eu não entendi nada mesmo
I was laughing way to loud with this video 😂
I grew up watching Pretty Little Liar's ❣️
IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE DOG?! Poor thing hahaha that face.
Am I the only one who thinks that Atlas it’s more alike to Ian than her own father (?
Ian is the boyfriend at aria 😭😊🤗

i actually died of laughing when she flipped his house over
Ok, I thought Ian's was hilarious! But Shay's was cute. I don't know, I'm torn between the two. If you want traditional, go with Shay's. If you want something to represent 2020, then go with Ian's. lol
Anyone else tried to peep if g was behind ash?
I love the PLL cast collabs
lol we actually have a candy cane lane where I live,  everyone drives to this street in the winter time during the holidays and looks at all the houses and their Christmas decorations!
This was the best video I've ever seen hahaha
I need more of drunk Shay. Absolutely hilarious.
when shay attempted to re smash ian’s gingerbread house and instead it the plastic and hit her hand   SENT ME
Y yo sin saber que dicen😪
Why no one is talking about the bad kisser? 😂
The twisted elf shot is a recipe I need, pleathe!

I just laughed so hard when she broke it omg didn’t expect that
Ian hasn’t find the man that he likes lol
i love them so so much
This friendship lmaoo

God, SHE IS SO SWEET!! I love them and the hole cast! They are great😂🥺❤️
Ángel baby was like WHAT?!?!
Ian and Shay are like best friends that would get drunk at a party.
I couldn't stop laughing at the end
I thought his gingerbread man had a cherry on his head
Ahagagaga love it😂
Why do I feel like someone's pointing a gun at them behind the camera😂
How am I just finding out about their collab

Omg I saw Shay Mitchell and pretty little liars cast in the title and was like omg I need to watch this it will be like a little memory throwback and reunion lol
laughed so hard at shay smashing lol
when he said “i do declare” i immediately thought of The Office
Lol Shay is such a little liar, Pretending to turn the camera off So Ian could say his hall pass and Shay’s answer is beeped out  Tut tut Shay :D
he never ages
"Whens the last time you were attracted to a women?"  "Oh wow, everyday."   lmaooo same Shay same 😂

Please realize how ableist it is to use the term “handicap” as something that would impede your success in the competition. Just say “you’ll have something taken away.” No need to bring disability terminology into it.
This was amazing.

Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2   If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 1 John 4:15   In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. John 10:28-30   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5   This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9   My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. John 15:12   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9   But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Colossians 3:15
Omg he sounds like RYAN Reynolds!!!
🇧🇷
they're so funny 😭😭😭
The action brought about by the response of self-preservation, which is natural intelligence, is instantaneous and it is also cultivated unconsciously or consciously. Similarly, we have recorded psychological preservation, the fear of not recording and the knowledge of that gives a central feeling that you must preserve yourself and from that you act.
Please do a episode with Ashley 🥰
I'm really glad they stayed in touch and friends even tho its been such a long time since the show ended.
oh boy i've missed Ian!
This video single-handedly saved my 2020

This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he conquered death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i
Ashley is so much like Hanna 🥰😂
Dear precious one, Jesus Christ loves you with a love that can't be described with mere words. It is an eternal love that will NEVER cease. When you receive Jesus Christ into your life, you are receiving a magnificent, awe-inspiring, monumental gift of love and deep intimacy with the one whom created you and knew you BEFORE the beginning of time.                       Dear Friend, fully receive Yeshua (Jesus Christ) right into your heart right now. Walk boldly along the path of Life, relying on your ever present Companion in Jesus. He will accompany you all the days of your life - and onwards into eternity. Acknowledge that you are a sinner in need of our Savior.                  Confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus is Lord of your life. Welcome Abba Yahweh (Father God) through Yeshua (Jesus the Christ) into your life. Receive grace by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection for the sins of all human-kind. You will then be justified in salvation and forever blessed with His abundant love by the Holy Spirit!  ❤️❤️❤️                                                                      (John 20 : 19, 21; John 14 : 27; Hebrew 12 : 2; Isaiah 41 : 13)
this was so entertaining
The light of my 2020 thank you guys !
Wait is shay bi?!

i am dead :D :D :D best video of 2020 <3 love you guys
QUE SAUDADE DE VOCÊS MEU DEUS
The facetimes were the best part😍😍
8:28 what a freaking queen 😭😭😭
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming

Hello, Good Day, Dude, I Want To Write Something On Me, Apologizing For Maybe Someone's Interest And Evaluate.  MEN / LADIES Those Who Ignore What I Will Tell In The Statement Will Regret Not Doing This After 2 Years At The Latest !!  While Bitcoin was in the $ 0.49 Price Band in 2010, Ethereum was in the $ 0.51 Price Band in 2015, while Chainlink was in the $ 0.17 Band in 2017, Nobody Could Have Predicted That It Will Reach Such Huge Figures, And Most Of Us We Missed It In Furya At These Prices. Many of us have said that we wish we had. According to 2020 data, Bitcoin $ 20,000 Ethereum $ 620 $ Chainlink Reached $ 15 Levels I am talking about the regret we experienced, I would like to thank my young friends. Their ages may not be enough, the world is waiting for a digital future, even if friends want this world order and technology require it because friends digital coins are very fast Many Countries Have Begun Issuing or Using Their Own Cryptocurrencies Because They Have Transaction Speed ​​And Very Low Transfer Cutoff Fees. As I Said Friends, Cryptocurrencies and BlockChain (Block Chain Technology) Are Increasing the Use of Crypto Currencies Enormously and Continuing to Increase Crypto Issuing Countries Dubai (UAE) Coin Venezuela (Petro) Coin Estonia (Est) Coin and finally Chinese Citizens 13 On October 2020, Digital Yuan was distributed, and for its spread, friends are here, you are not late for anything I mean, Digital Coins are waiting for us in the future. Our country is very beautiful stretch the field Türkin I'm sorry for Your Own Digital I understand the money to Eject or late Dünüşüy Friends Events ..  Since you have come up to these titles, you are interested in cryptocurrencies, and what I will say and the recommendations I will give will be beneficial to all of you ... For this, it will be enough to use an Android or Ios phone. As required by my long-term studies and research, 3 different mobile applications, which are not valid now but have a bright future, I will share 3 different mobile applications with which you can do mining (Crypto Money Mining). In these projects, My Most Liked Project Owners All Over The World Instead Of Creating An Ordinary Coin Is To Issue A (Global) Cryptocurrency That Will Be Valid And We Can Use In Every Store And Shopping. If we could use Litecoin, Chainlink, they would move their prices to a higher level because the demand would be too much. We are very lucky for this, friends, like me, those who met with these cryptocurrencies in the last quarter of 2020, do not be upset, it is not late for anything, enough let's realize and start let's learn.  You can download the applications from the Play Store.

The casual shade ian throwed at lucy hale 😂😂😂😂😂
Hi everyone! I hope y'all are having a blessed day! 😁 If you are reading this, it's not by accident! God wants you to see this! ^^ Hosanna to the Lord! He is SO AMAZING!!!! ❤️😄❤️ There is only ONE God, the TRUE God, he is the maker of heaven and earth. And he made us in his image and likeness, male and female, with dignity, value, worth, and purpose! ❤️ He made us to worship him. But we chose to sin against him, to rebel against him, and to disobey him. So, as a result, we are separated from God and live under the foolish myth that to some degree, we are each our own God, declaring right and wrong, living our own life, by our own rules, and standards. And guess what! That God ♥️LOVINGLY♥️ came into human history as the man ♥️Jesus Christ fully God and fully man!♥️ He was born of a virgin and he lived a life without sin, though he was tempted in every way as we are. And he WENT to the CROSS and there he SUBSTITUTED HIMSELF for sinners. When Jesus went to the cross, he took WILLINGLY upon him the SIN of those who would come to trust him! ♥️ That means me, as a sinner, Jesus WENT to the cross and took upon himself ALL my sin, past, present, and future! 😭❤️ And Jesus Christ God who was a man, DIED IN MY PLACE, FOR MY SINS, PAYING MY DEBT TO GOD, AND PURCHASING MY SALVATION!!!♥️♥️♥️ Jesus' dead body was then laid in the tomb, and for 3 days, he was buried. On the third day, a Sunday, (which is why we worship on that day) Jesus ROSE in VICTORY over satan, sin, death, demons, and hell.

And he is KING OF KINGS and he is LORD OF LORDS and he is RULING and REIGNING over ALL people, commanding EVERYONE EVERYWHERE to REPENT of EVERYTHING and he is COMING AGAIN to JUDGE THE LIVING AND THE DEAD, and those who trust in him, will enjoy ETERNITY and his KINGDOM of heaven FOREVER, and those who do not will SUFFER APART from him in the CONSCIOUS ENTERAL TORMENTS of HELL.

Hi everyone! I hope y'all are having a blessed day! 😁 If you are reading this, it's not by accident! God wants you to see this! ^^ Hosanna to the Lord! He is SO AMAZING!!!! ❤️😄❤️ There is only ONE God, the TRUE God, he is the maker of heaven and earth. And he made us in his image and likeness, male and female, with dignity, value, worth, and purpose! ❤️ He made us to worship him. But we chose to sin against him, to rebel against him, and to disobey him. So, as a result, we are separated from God and live under the foolish myth that to some degree, we are each our own God, declaring right and wrong, living our own life, by our own rules, and standards. And guess what! That God ♥️LOVINGLY♥️ came into human history as the man ♥️Jesus Christ fully God and fully man!♥️ He was born of a virgin and he lived a life without sin, though he was tempted in every way as we are. And he WENT to the CROSS and there he SUBSTITUTED HIMSELF for sinners. When Jesus went to the cross, he took WILLINGLY upon him the SIN of those who would come to trust him! ♥️ That means me, as a sinner, Jesus WENT to the cross and took upon himself ALL my sin, past, present, and future! 😭❤️ And Jesus Christ God who was a man, DIED IN MY PLACE, FOR MY SINS, PAYING MY DEBT TO GOD, AND PURCHASING MY SALVATION!!!♥️♥️♥️ Jesus' dead body was then laid in the tomb, and for 3 days, he was buried. On the third day, a Sunday, (which is why we worship on that day) Jesus ROSE in VICTORY over satan, sin, death, demons, and hell. And he COMMISSIONED us with the HOLY SPIRIT, to be MISSIONARIES telling this ♥️AMAZINGLY GOOD NEWS♥️ that there's a ♥️God♥️ and PASSIONATELY, LOVINGLY, CONTINUALLY, RELENTLESSLY pursues us and he ASCENDED into heaven. And today, Jesus is ALIVE and WELL and he's seated on a throne, and he is ruling and reigning over ALL nations, ALL cultures, ALL philosophies, ALL races, ALL periods of time. And he is KING OF KINGS and he is LORD OF LORDS and he is RULING and REIGNING over ALL people, commanding EVERYONE EVERYWHERE to REPENT of EVERYTHING and he is COMING AGAIN to JUDGE THE LIVING AND THE DEAD, and those who trust in him, will enjoy ETERNITY and his KINGDOM of heaven FOREVER, and those who do not will SUFFER APART from him in the CONSCIOUS ENTERAL TORMENTS of HELL. That is what we believe, we believe is JESUS!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️🙌♥️♥️♥️♥️ God bless you!!

I love Ian and Shay videos
Jeremiah Chapter 10:3 For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.  4 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.  5 They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.  6 Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.  7 Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.  8 But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities.

Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
bro ian harding still looking better then ever and shay is also lookin better then ever

This is the video 2020 needed. I can't stop laughing. You guys are so funny and entertaining. Thank you for doing what you do. :)
I laughed so hard when Ian did the Southern accent and Italian Accent. And when Ashley told Ian to get more art lessons then it will be good. And when Tyler said Ian needs to see a therapist. Also when shay punched the gingerbread house. 😆🤗😂🤣
Why is she so perfect? Her face is something more in this world
Ian: "it is supposed to symbolize 2020" 😂😂

Где блин русские?
I LOVE THIS
The cups they got from dollar tree 🤣
YESSS!!!!! Needed to see this duo again
This has nothing to do with the video...URGENCY! ALARM BELLS GOING OFF Holy spirit says choose today if you are going to be in heaven with Jesus as your Lord and Savior, his arm is extended #repent #believe. Jesus died on the cross for our sins and rose again and is seated at the right side of God in heaven!! Choose him as your Savior, invite Holy Spirit into your heart. (Get baptized)  have a relationship w/God, turn away from sin, read your bible KJV or NIV are some options. It isn't about a religion, about a relationship with Jesus Christ/ God!!! We are living out Rev. In the Bible now. Jesus is returning soon to get his bride from the earth!! You can join us!!! Jesus wants you to come home!!! 🙏🙏💐😊😊💝💝💝
Shay continuing to smash Ian's house at the end even though it was wrecked already SENT ME 😂
His 'thank you for being interested, Shay' at 9:55 while she tends to her house is hilarious😆
Awhhh this makes me so happy

https://youtu.be/Q9R.-yXXXwC8 Wisdom Follow Jesus Christ, he rose from the dead! Obey him before its too late. He is the only way to get to the Father John 14:6 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; Hebrews 5:9 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Acts 2:38 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord: Hebrews 12:14 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy. Proverbs 28:13
11:49 Is the funniest moment ever hahaha RUDE

I didn’t know I needed this in my life
I hope they both quarantined for at least 2 weeks before doing this. LA County is doing terrrrible with COVID-19. I'm actually a bit annoyed they didn't have any disclaimer about quarantine-ing before this. Like people with public platforms should set an example. Otherwise I am loving this PLL combo and ginger bread competition - some quality Youtube content.
Loveeee their friendship
🥺🥺🥺
See you both in the next video "Breaking things with Ian n shay" please!!!!
SO CUTE

The way Ian said "lUcY hALe" bc he knows that's what we want to hear then when Tyler said Ian needs to see a therapist🤣🤣

This video cleared my skin, cured my seasonal depression, and fixed my credit. Thank you.
LMAO! love you guys! xo
ANYONE LOOKING FOR A NETFLIX SHOW TO WATCH I RECOMMEND: JULIE AND THE PHANTOMS!  It's actually very good, It’s about three boys in a boyband who die on their important night to become legends in 1995. They become ghosts and are in 2020 where they appear in a girl’s life due to a connection. You have to see the show to see how it unfolds! Your in for a ride full of emotions. Super great only 9 episodes. Look at the reviews on google even adults are enjoying watching it! It will lift your whole mood up 😃
I love when you guys do video together it’s so funny🤣🤣🤣
MORE OF THIS BUT WITH THE WHOLE CAST!!!!!
🤣🤣
Ahaha I always love your guys collars!! Ian’s so naturally funny with you 😂

I’m late but it makes my day knowing that the cast of PLL are still friends
Shay is my hall pass😅🤚❤👀
Drink mixer: "How drunk do you want to be for this?" Shay and Ian: "Yes."  Bonus points for getting so drunk that you slip into a southern accent. I, too, slip into a southern accent when hammered. 😂
Hilarious!!
i love how at the start shay was like this is going to be the first of few haha
Shay is absolutely terrifying...but in a very attractive way lmao like please smash my head like you did Ian’s gingerbread house 😭

GUMMLEBERRIES OMG 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
There is a lot of reasons to be envious of Shay, but my #1 is that she gets to be friends with Ian Harding.
Okay, everything good, everything perfect! Lots of laughs but wait a minute: DID IAN GET MARRIED???? (Pause at 2:47). I don't follow him on ig but the minute I noticed it i went to his profile but I couldn't find anything. Now I'm just curious about that! Somebody let me know! 👀🤔
M alegraron el dia

“Because I’m a 70 year old Italian man inside” - he says with a Southern accent 😂
