I was a micro owner of Authentic. It was an unbelievable thrill!
Oh yeah this is the year where the Kentucky Derby was run after the Belmont Stakes in September instead of May.
a horse that races a derby that fast is no upset. That is a blistering time, maybe the bookies underestimated, but that is legit speed
Because of Covid no one was there lol
They wanted Tiz the Law to be great so bad. He's just wasn't.
Just noticed this.   1:44 You can hear the whip smacking Tiz the Law the entire way down the stretch.  He musta been mic'd up.
Hardly an upset...Manny did not move Tiz the Law to confront the loose on the lead Authentic until they were halfway around that turn, and did not ask for the horse's run for earnest until the top of the stretch. Authentic did what any good speed horse does when he has had 8 furlongs free on the lead...repelled it.
Best trainer of all time even if Chruchill Downs smears his name around for bs reasons he will not win this years derby in 2025 but he is going to go on another run like we have seen before because you messed with the horns and got the bull
Doped horse

Ladies and gentlemen,  please hold your tickets. Bobby has been caught a record 32 times for cheating. Spank, spank. Poor Bobby.
authentic wouldve beat seattle slew in a foot race.
The title still makes me laugh. “Massive upset” and the second choice won the race lol
Another Doped up Pace Horse That Never Quits...This Barn Robs Other Connections of Huge Purses & Races...Disgusting
great horse, too bad the piece of human garbage democrat party killed the economy on purpose and we didnt have any fans....
Ahhhh I miss the pandemic. So relaxed, no crowds, derby run in prime fall conditions. Those were the days 😂😂😂
This was not a massive upset. 8-1 is a short price in the derby
Massive Upset?!? 2021 Kentucky Derby: “Hold my beer”
Tyler Mac they have 3 paces lift too go
Tyler Mac The men is along side him so he trots along in the distance as he was the other two and now he speeds towards the club house turn as well and the girls are there too
Tyler Mac and he’s off in the kid boy stakes he is here for race one for the first time pass the rail and here comes the favorite
Bob Baffert did it again! Let the hating begin!!
The Covid Derby
Gorgeous
So excited to have my second Derby horse! Authentic in 2020 and Mage in 2023!
what!   authentic  was the best most awesome for the whole season!
Tiz The Law ran a good race but came up short. I was really hoping he would of became the 14th triple crown winner. His win in the Belmont was amazing

Racing does not kill horses rather it allows to express their inner racehorse
That’s my boy! Hopefully one of his foals will win the 2025 Derby!
8-1 a "massive" upset? We just had to go two more years to get a true nearly 100-1 MASSIVE upset!
Another chaeting win for Baffert he hasnt had a single legit win in decades. Baffert should be in prison
Le falto jinete a Tiz The law
NBC can’t help but lie.    The 2nd choice won.  Liars
My god I miss 2020 myracehorse…
It’s been 1 year now
I’ll never forget sitting on the couch with my mom and calling Authentic to win the upset. I should’ve absolutely bet on the race, I would’ve made a killing!
Bob Baffert graduated University Of Arizona Wildcats !!
If Bob Baffert was really drugging he must be stupid to not let enough time go by for picograms to wear off! 🙄 You people who condemn him, do not know the millions he gives to Old Friends, which is a place for retired race horses to go, along with the millions he has given to New Vocations. Why don't you Google that yourselves.
He mite added drugs on Silver Charm
Probably doped this one as well...
This the law,oh well is only a hundred dollars....
Which has the horse racing special betting website, the prestige is quite good.
Picked Authentic to win. Loved jumping up and down screaming at the TV during that final stretch.
That was revenge for the start...
It's not a massive upset, dude. 😂
It’s always an upset. The favorite never wins!
Nw yrk traffic
Name a more iconic duo than Bob Baffert and John Valesquez. I'll wait 😂

My fav horse. Hands down I'll have anotherrrr 😆 😆 classic
Does anyone know if an inquiry was filed for the stumble/bump at the start?  Seems like 4th place finishing Honor AP might have done better if he hadn't had that happen.  Authentic got bumped as well, but Honor AP was actually cut off. :(
amazing how juice propels horses...... tiz.... not juiced.... Thousand words....really....Authentic.... destroying the winners  circle....both juiced.

Wow. That was incredible
some ppl in these comments don’t realize that not all race horses/animals are abused. most of them are actually living like royalty

Authentic should never have been 8-1. It was great for my bank account, but he should have been the favorite
Not an upset. He was my first choice
massive upset???????

Hi! So I don’t really follow horse racing, but I really love horses. Could someone please explain why race horses have such funny names??
binabagsakan ni John Velazquez sa kaliwa para huwag sumandal sa balya at kumaskas kasabay ni Tiz the Law
8-1 is massive?
you guys know horses break their legs a lot during these races and die of stress and discomfort, right?
It was a huge upset because according to the experts, he could never get the distance. The arrogant jockey on TTL just knew he was going by Big A-II, and was looking back for any other competition. The nerve of this guy...lol. Meanwhile Johnny V had him measured. Pressed the "GO button" and it was Sayonara Franco-san. The TTL owner did not take it too well with the suggestive remarks.
Just rewatched. bunch of Honor Code races, and I realized he is not a fast horse.  I had some discussions with people about Honor AP, as in about every race prior to the Derby he was dead last and I kew in the Derby that would be a death sentence.  Even tho he was bumped here, he was even with Authentic and was being scrubbed on hard, like Honor Code in his races, but he simply is not a fast horse.  Their greatest asset is they can continue to render 12 second type furlongs but keep on doing it.  In a straight 10F line, they would be better off than in American dirt configurations, where you may end up having to go 9 wide and lose valuable ground.
Not a massive upset
RIP Winning Impression 🙏

i love how they still use today
So how many drugs where pumped into these horses before this race? My guess is 1 gallon
God, this makes me so sad
i love
This is animal abuse. Stop supporting exploitation of horses.
Led at the start, led at the finish!

Velazquez viejo nomas Velasquez viejo nomas lo aguanto a palo limpio 🇺🇾🇺🇾🇺🇾
It was massive in the sense Tiz the Law was an unusually big Kentucky derby  favorite and lost.  Especially considering the  race didn't have the normal 20 entrants but only 17.  Still, a bit of  hyperbole to be sure
Dang, I forgot they were running in Sept. First year I haven't made a bet in a long time f-ing virus.

Use to love Baffert, but after all the doping, they are all hollow victory's now. Sad they drug these horses and i was one of the biggest triple crown fans.
so very sad - two terrible Derbies in a row - ugh
What people don’t understand is when a Derby favorite that was less than even money to win, is beaten, it IS a massive upset. If Authentic would have been higher odds, it also works but either way, it still was an upset. Baffert was a magician training the horse and Johnny Velazquez is a Hall of Famer. What a ride and what an effort by Authentic

Great race!
me im a little dissapointed  by Tiz the Law  who should run hidden but it was a good second place , i think TIZ THE LAW is better than Authentic,  its the jocket who lost the race not the horse , the jocket did too much outside and  i have more tiz the law was in Tiz the Law was in the interior Fourth at a time of the race bekoz Authentic did not take his interior ,the jockey of Tiz the Law he should run hidden in the preakness stakes and in the Breeders  and in the pegasus , hes the most stepper in his legs
So, an outsider wins a race and we are meant to be surprised????? Newsflash buddy........ horse racing and greyhound racing are 2 of the most corrupt sports out there. How many times have you heard of a jockey, trainer or owner being "up before the stewards"??? Do you think they are going for a beer? no, they have to answer questions about performance....... 3 of the biggest crooks in UK are K Fallon, J Fortune and W Carson, all jockeys that have thrown races
Authentic race a beautiful race..
Mike Smith gave Honor AP no chance to win the race...sure he got bumped at the start...but he kept HAP in the 5 path  all the way around the track. He had to save ground and blew it. He gave McKenzie a poor ride earlier in the day....the guy has been losing races because he's not giving his horse a chance to win. There was a time Baffert wouldn't go anywhere but Mike Smith for his jockey needs. But even Baffert is seeing Smith isn't getting it done.
Gee, one more win by Baffert and he'll have exactly the same number of Derby wins as Lance Armstrong had Tour de France wins.
John Velázquez demostró que tremendo yoki se lo puso y se lo dejó ahí mismo lo Mario a todos Jajaja

What makes it a massive upset is the odds. While 8-1 on its face are not bad, in fact they are pretty average for horse racing. Authentic was facing a horse that was 3 to 5. When you do the math out,  if these horses ran together 40 times in the Kentucky Derby, Authentic would only win 3 times as opposed to Tiz the Law winning 24.
That horse looks like he could go again.
NBC needs to lose horse racing for good.  Watched the Churchill feed most of the time, much better.  You don't get Larry Collmus, but everything else is better (Travis Stone is great too).
Church what we say ? Holy holy holy holyspirt!!!🙌🙌🙌😌😁
Bob I forgot lucky and the jockey have a good day be safe 🤠🏇🏽🍀🌄
Hardly a “massive” upset. BTW Authentic was the better horse and he won easily.
The word massive will eventually seem meaningless if continued to be used in this context
As a minority owner of Authentic, this was the greatest thrill of my life. Can't wait for the Preakness and Breeders cup. Good luck to all.
Am I the only one who sees Honor AP get cutoff coming out of the gate?
The best is when you pick a 70\1 , 35\1, 3\2, and a 2\1 . Then the 2/1 goes nuts like somebody stuck a nail in the horses leg.  The 70\1 comes in 1st and you miss the superfecta..

Porque ese hombre canoso siempre lleva caballos A1 a los mas importantes clásicos.? Aquí tenia a Nadal y otro que estaba invicto, se lesionaron y surgió este Authentic. Creo que este señor Bob Baffert es un genio entrenando caballos de carreras. Claro la monta de Jhon Velasquez fué impecable.

2 mins. Not bad. Wasn't under 2 like Secretariat & Sham but they ran fast
This was not an upset by any means. Bob Baffert got his 6th Kentucky Derby with this win.
I agree that it was not a huge upset. Authentic was the third choice in the betting.
It would be cool to see another Secretariat.
The only “massive upset” is the fact that animals are still being used/killed for entertainment.
*Not one media outlet has announced that Hillary Clinton lost her appeal and must testify on September 9, 2020 about those 600k+ emails @ 9:30AM. Expect an alien invasion, mass shooting, or a devastating earthquake or some type of huge fuckary.*
Steroids has truly ruined horse racing.  I'm still a fan of the animals themselves, but come on.  Enough is enough.  They need to crack down on this.  It's the best juice wins lately.  It should be the best horse.  It's pretty disturbing.  Anyone who follows thoroughbred racing will tell you, this horse was on the hardcore juice.  Happy for Johnny V though.
To all of you people saying this is not a massive upset let me explain it to you!! First of all, Authentic was not supposed to be able to carry the distance according to pedigree and his last race. Tiz the Law has looked like a monster. The rest of the field was very suspect outside of Honor A.P. Authentic staying the distance and beating the 3/5 favorite is a massive upset in the eyes of people who know the sport. Not to me because I liked and bet Authentic, but if you asked 10 people familiar with horse racing 9 out of 10 would say Tiz the Law would win barring something strange happening. Nothing strange happened so it was a massive upset. Class is now over, you can go back to making stupid comments!!!
Hello, I want to cooperate with you~~~
Wow, that's a real animal dude
It wasn't a massive upset ! Authentic was program 2nd favorite.NBC sports doesn't know what they're talking about.
Great job to all
All the fans rooting for Tiz . Sorry man Bob is the Best.

Oh, I thought another horse was ganna die
There was a strategy Authentic was 3 to 4 wide. It made Tiz  The Law travel wider knowing that would be the case. That took many lengths out of the favorite.

Get it Authentic: )
FAKE NEWS it was in no way an upset or massive
Why was it considered such a “massive upset”?
Gehrhrhrhrhrj
Incredible feat by Bob Baffert!!
SOMEONE OTHER THAN THE FAVORITE WON THE KENTUCKY DERBY.  THE WORLD IS SHOCKED ... AT HOW AMNESIAC MODERN JOURNALISTS ARE.
What a beautiful race!  Thoroughbred horses racing are a breathtaking sight.
What if I told you Jay Z is God in the last Bible book (Revelation/Apocalypse) and that I was His Christ. Would you believe me? I have “Jesus” on my thigh and Revelation 19:16 says on His robe and thigh is a name written: KING OF KINGS LORD OF LORDS
Had Tiz The Law had enough power to beat Authentic, he could've kept the Triple Crown going. Instead, the jackpot grows to $1,500,000 in 2.021.
I don’t even like horse racing but I like the fact none got hurt or died. But you don’t have to use your crop so many times.
Authentic was my horse!
👍🏽💥🔥
Oh...the Kentucky Derby is still a thing?!
Tiz was my 1st choice, HAP was my 2nd choice, Authentic was my 3rd choice, and NY Traffic was my 4th... I didn't think Authentic could get the distance since his sire is Into Mischief, he hardly won the Haskell, and when I seen Gamine fade to 3rd in the Oaks the day before, I really lost faith. I wasn't even sure if he'd place tbh. I was just hoping he didn't fade like Uncle Chuck did in the Travers... Needless to say, I was DEAD wrong. I'm sure the already pricey stud fee of Into Mischief is going to become even more pricey since we now know he's capable of producing more than just sprinters and milers. That was an impressive, exhilarating, gutsy performance for sure and I hope Baffert takes him to the BCC this year. On another note, how about HAP? He got slammed by NY Traffic out of the gates, was at the back of the field for the majority of the race, and yet he closed up to 4th? Wow. I'm convinced that had he not been bothered, he would've been right there with TTL at the wire.

Massive upset? It was a little bit of a shock, I was hoping Tiz got it, but it wasn't that upsetting lol.
these races would be more appealing if the dark cloud of performance drugs did not hover over these races.

In defense of the headline, TTL losing this race to ANYONE (even a Baffert trained third choice) constitutes a HUGE upset. TTL was the biggest Derby chalk in over 30 years. To go off at 3-5 in a 15 horse field demonstrates just how DOMINANT he had been leading up to this race, and how the betting public (and most experts) saw little chance of him losing. Just going off of the odds, the betting public thought TTL was over 13 times more likely to win than Authentic, which is on par with a 50-1er winning most years (when the favorite is in the 3-1 to 4-1 range). This was, indeed, a MASSIVE UPSET!
It wasnt a massive upset, authentic was known that he could win that race
The legendary Stallion Secretariat and its great rival Sham, remain the best bearers of the fastest race of all time. Legends !!

How is that a 'massive upset'?  Take out the favourite and Authentic had much the best form: the question was simply whether he would see out the trip, which was certainly a serious doubt.
They went so fast I wanted for to win i’m getting horseback riding lessons!
It was not an UPSET, the favorite is an average horse leading an average generation. The winner  Authentic was the best each inch of the race, despite Bob Bafffer, based on his post-race conference declaration,  wanted the favorite to win.  Kind of odd.
Congratulations
Good morning volviiiiiii
Made an audible HEEHAW🤣💕
the fact that nobody sees anything wrong with this is incredibly disturbing.
I don’t understand
Lets not forget the fact that if there was another quarter mile the last horse on the left side of the screen was steam rollin past everyone.
I've never watched one video about horses and for some reason this video is recommended to me? I live in Texas.... Not Kentucky... Why is this on my recommended?
The names are a riot!
Makes me glad I'm not a horse.!
🏇 racing the rich get richer, same old thing👎🏇 Bob Baffert wins again.💤💤🤡🌜💰🌛
I love horses  but they were hitting them  so me no like😤
I think if Tiz The Law had been moved up a little sooner , he’d of won it. Authentic looked like he was running out of steam and by the time Tiz The Law made his bid it was too late
Zoos and horse racing need to NOT be a thing anymore. The derby is usually a giant draw but noone went this year except the super rich and stuck up middle class who are 250k in debt pretending to be rich.
Jesus Loves you. He suffered and died for you. You must believe in Him to have everlasting life. God is real and He loves you. Don’t let this world deceive you. Being with God is worth everything. He is amazing. God Bless you today.
My second time watching horse racing, why do they hit the horses to make them go faster? For other people’s enjoyment... Kinda terrible.
Poor horses man
The BLM terrorists failed to stop it . Oh well.  .

22 and change 1st call then 46 2nd call..what is up with these juiced? horses still winning at the end. Authentic should have tired and gave way...just my opinion.

Hey everyone! Save a great champion or find your best horse. I did. I bought a horse of trainers listings on CANTERUSA. I won everything I dreamed of, had a great time doing it, and retired with a sound superstar horse that is stunning 17.2 barefoot and my hero. Check it out: CANTERUSA. My horse was 2500 as a 3 year old. Was worth 200k as a 7 year old. Is priceless as an 18 year old
The rich won.
another worthless sport.
Way to go authentic
Authentic is describe as, "The bad kid in school who gets good grades" Those ear plugs makes him a focused machine!!

Do rich ppl bet on horse races? I'm tryna learn as many wealthy hobbies and investments as possible before 18

Get out of satan system and get in God system before its to late ⏳
as a non-horseracing guy who's a big sports fan in general - the only thing constituting a 'Massive Upset' (according to your clickbait title) based on the odds and the movement up and down for pole position was the fact that the 3rd place finish went to a horse/jockey with 46-1 odds  *idk about horserace betting but do you get anything for a 'podium/top 3' finish or are there ways to bet on that cuz surely betting on a 46-1 odds horse to finish top 3 would still be like a 15 to 1 payout or something like that - any feedback appreciated, cheers
That hug at the end made me happy tbh. I don't even know them. That was so wholesome.  Can't wait for the point where all of us can hug each other again whenever we want to.

Wow ! What a surprise! Bob Baffert celebrating after a Derby finish!
Bruh these names. "NY Traffic" "Money Moves" Lmaooo
so no one going to point out the naruto runner at 2:14
I don’t get the point of this sport
Are they hitting the horses?😤

Massive upset... Cuts to happy people hugging and cheering
Was no upset. Best horse won.
Look at all those people in the crowd; theyre probably gonna get us killed with Coronavirus, huh NBC?
Slow fractions and the winner was never headed down the stretch. Tiz the Law looked tired and was somewhat lugging down the stretch.
Wait... what was the "massive upset"?
A bunch of rich people paying racers to beat horses so they run fast... wow... so cool smh
I was just talking to my friends about steel ball run. And I searched for it and I found this. 10/10 but I don’t like horse races
Bob is the man........ 6 times  ..
I feel bad for these horses
Not even remotely a massive upset.
wack asf
Those horses are so beautiful 🐎
The cgi one was better. No real horses were hurt
Someone getting a big bag $
Great! A trainer who dopes his horses and has been caught killing horses is allowed to continue in the sport. So many livelihoods lost because of covid, but let's abuse horses so addicts can gamble. USA.
Thought I'd wait a day or two to see if they changed their mind. Looks like they're okay with Bob winning.
why am I here? I don’t even watch horse racing
8 - 1 is a "massive upset"??  Anyway, leave it to the Democrats to ruin the greatest horse race of them all.
I love horse racing!!!
I never actually been in a horse race, but at least they look awesome
Horse race 🏇 😎
HoRsE rAcInG iS aBuSiVe. Man stfu people a horse's favorite thing to do is run
Missed hearing  " and down the stretch they !"  That phrase not being spoken in excitement it really wasn't the Kentucky Derby to me at all
And 8 -1 is not a massive upset.  It’s a horrible headline!
Wow
Terrible trip for Honor AP, but he still fought for it. He’s a stunning looking TB.
Im a basketball fan bruh
Check out MLTV Productions For Comedy Skits  & More!
Tell me why, the riders get to wear masks but the horses don't. This race should've been cancelled
I’m still confused, I thought that Massive Upset won the race, but the winner was Authentic
This is my moms account but i really love horse i really wish i was there!!!!!!! HORSES ARE AWESOME!!!!!!
Unless we wish to destroy each other we must implement a permanent UBI now! Then we can transition to a RBE.  Also support the Money Free Party and The Venus Project so we can finally go beyond  politics poverty and war.
Horse racing is so abusive
What a Race Congrats Authentic!
If you are reading this comment:  BE BLESSED!!!⭐️💫✨💕❤️
Did anybody else notice Tiz looked like he was being held back? Or does he always run with his head turned to the right?
rare occasion where the jockey was the determining factor in a race
I won $1976 on this race.....thank you
Its not really that weird BlueDot, there is a few of us......
It’s weird how most of us living on Earth will never meet or even acknowledge each other’s existence. For example, if you’re reading my comment; this is probably the first and last time you’ll ever see me.
its rigged
now I don’t watch much horse racing but i’m very interested in it, but what are those stick things they wave around on the horse?
😎😎😎😎
How is that a “massive upset”? I thought somebody with like 27-1 or 38-1 odds would win. Not the second or third best option lol
Disgusting "sport". I bet most kentucky fans despise spanish bull fights but endorse this crap...
8-1... Massive Upset....
Bob bafer #1 cabrones
What do you call Gasly at Monza if this is a massive upset?
Ok
Well it looks like BLM had no effect on the race it went through and was completed

Massive upset mean ,Tiz the law got beat
Trump is a traitor and a coward.
I wanna beat the horseshit out of those........jockeys too. 😣 wanna club them so bad..
Hay qua
why does the track need to be so wide
Horse racing is abusive AF
15 horse should have been DQ’ed
I always respect how John uses his skills, he had a bad, bad outing and recouped excellently...great run. Cordero must be smiling!
Haber/,,mnnnnnnnnjkkkk mmnnn y el que se le ha hecho a un equipo que no ha tenido la
The only "upset" was Mr. Big News taking third lol. It was always either going to be Tiz the Law or Authentic who would win the Derby. I was expecting Honor A.P. to take third - though if Finnick the Fierce hadn't been scratched, he would have been my third choice.
Bob Baffert is the Jose Conseco/Mark McGuire of horse racing. All he does is dope his horses.
NBC sucks but at least we didnt have to sit thru another year of "how to make a julep" or stupid human interest angels. FOCUS on the horses and maybe show other  past races other than BIG RED
I know they want the general public to watch but would it be too much to ask for them to post the breeding of the horses on the post parade
I picture Ace Ventura slapping a jockey with that slappy thingy 🤣🤣
Authentic needs to be drug tested...
Massive? Horse was a 8–1 odds would have crazy if it was a 43-1 odds that one
Hay
bro do they even know that crops don’t do anything? why can they just use leg
why do we have to bring horses into this 😫
I’m against any sports that have animals involved, they’re always treated so poorly. It just makes me angry and upset that people enjoy these types of sports.
I didn't even know the races were happening!  I love Bob Baffert!👏
Congratulations Authentic
I thought a horse died or something. that would be a massive upset
all  the -expert said that authentic was not good for the distance. the result, all were wrong
My horse on Red Redemption 2 would smoke these guys in a race
The Derby is a complete waste of time considering they rob the real winners of their trophies. They tarnished an American institution and diminished it to such a degree that it is common rather than exceptional. There is nothing to admire when whiners are rewarded.

Go tiz law
The one time I pick a winning horse, Maximum Security,  he was unfairly disqualified
When Larry Collmus avoids an under the wire cliche-ridden script -- he can call it with the best of 'em.
Seriously I watched the video twice to find the “massive upset” and the comments have given me the answer. Should’ve gone their first 😭
P.R. 🇵🇷 👍 the Best jockey. 1 and 2 place..
Watch my videos to prevent getting cancer and COVID-19
Massive upset? A massive upset would be the 43-1 horse winning. Or the 27-1 horse. Or the 22-1 Horse. Or the 13-1 horse. Maybe even the 12-1 horse. But the 8-1 horse? No. Just a normal upset.
The riders should be wipped the same amount of hits they put on the horses as a celebration ritual.
Did the horses kneel for a racist, terrorist organization like mlb, nba did?
Who feels a little bad for the people in the back
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

They really just slap the fk out of these horses huh then just throw them away like trash once they're down pretty pathetic
why is this 2 in trending
Massive upset??? The horse was 8-1, 80-1 would've of been a massive upset, typical of NBC always trying to sensationalize a sporting event.
Massive upset😂😂😂
Who comes up with these names? 😂
rigged every year the favorite gets cancelled so the payout won’t be big
To the person that’s reading this:  You’re very intelligent and adorable human! I hope you Stay healthy through these tough times,   My dream is to have 10k. I been struggling to get there!!,!!🙏!!!.
Congratulations to Churchill Downs for getting the race on.  It may have been later than originally planned, but still great entertainment.  I would agree with those who say it isn't really a massive upset that Authentic won.  You could have been forgiven for thinking it was Tiz The Law's race by right.  However, Baffert is real genius in getting his horses ready.  I liken him to my favourite all time UK flat racing trainer the late Sir Henry Cecil.  For those of you Stateside, what can we expect to see in The Preakness?
NBC: it ends in a massive upset    Half the comments: *no no I think it was fine*
First of all, most people with common sense realize that this was no "massive upset". Second, those betting odds are set by bettors (People like you and me). Yeah, the "house" may try to set the odds, but they can't make a horse run. I have lost enough money gambling on dogs and horses to know that handicapping is overrated at least 50% of the time. It works well when there are only two horses on the track......not so well when there are a lot of horses in a race. Too much un-predictability! Tiz the Law just got beat by a horse that ran a better race yesterday that him.
:)
Trump 2020!!
the nature boy ric flair won!!
Not a Massive upset for those of us who bet on the champ 🏆😁
Aww when I was younger like 4 my dad would take me to races and hed always have me choose the horses to bet on and I always had a good eye for the winner lol. I was his lucky picker. My criteria was unknown Id just be like "that one" and bam it would win lol.
The horses are powerful I've never seen before in my life
Jesus who enjoys this is real human trash
Love it
Title should be baffert juice strikes again
how are we all gathered here watching horse racing again
Our main Goal is to show the world how beautiful Bangladesh is; we will target Bengali culture, village life of Bangladesh, things BD Fish & Fishing Life.❤🏵🌼💥🐟

No point to this crap of a sport. The horse does everything.

It would be funnier if the horses rode the guys.

Funny cause I was at a barn party 🐴 and as they were about to go I said...16 or 18 will win it 👀 watched live 😳 couldn’t believe it 🤪 I can pick winners when I have no money on em 🏇people there are always stunned when I can 😂
Mytqr et de se retrouver en pleine forme et toi ici tout va bien de tes conseils avisés et une bonne

Bob Baffert ? can never be a massive upset this guy is a Legend
Dude just stands there looking at horses and won millions
Tiz.  The.  Law.   Was.  Arrested.  Sept.  5.  Never   underestimate.   A.  Bob.  Baffert.  Horse
I usually love the derby, but as a Louisvillian, we have other stuff to worry about right now. Like arresting the cops that murdered Breonna Taylor
The  Derby  was  spectacular .
To the person that’s reading this:  You’re very intelligent and adorable human! I hope you Stay healthy through these tough times,   My dream is to have 1k. I been struggling to get there🙏🙏❤️❤️👍👍❤️❤️
To those who are deeply hurting, know that you are loved on this earth by someone, think about the positive things in life. I know it’s hard right now and it will get better, I promise! I hope you have an AMAZING September, stay blessed! 💟✝️ Like this comment for good luck.
Mask = COWARD DUMMIES!!!
How is this still a thing in 2020?! These poor horses are being hit for no reason and people actually enjoy it?!?!?! Wtf
6cxz
What’s the upset
Bulls first then this...
All I can see is people wearing masks wow
How is a 8-1 Winning a Massive Upset?  Stupid!
Ah come on haters ..... It's about time the favorite loses
You need to replace the person who writes the titles for your vids they're always over the top
That horse fast
How many were destroyed this year?
whatch how NY Traffic (15), cuts off A.P Honor (16), and watch out Tiz the law (14) pushes him into the back of it all. All within the first 5 seconds of the race
poplin eraser
It is a massive upset when a 3-5 horse loses...
Glad to see they have to come up with some bs title for the video to get views on this dying "sport"  Even tho it's only 500k after 15 hours 😆
Can't help but thinking about Tony Soprano sayin "COME ON PIE O MY"
why is this still a sport in 2020 i dont understand
Horses lives matter!! GET OFF THEIR BACK!!!
Check out Travis Stone's call. Churchill Downs announcer which NBC should have used then they're lame announcers. Kentucky Derby posted his call on Instagram don't know if they did on Facebook. But much better track announcer.
"Tiz the Law" was so courteous & polite  to "Authentic"...go ahead lead the way ..bangg.. u got it..turn the music on "CRY" EXO CBX..cry..cry...KA CHING !!
Don't bet the ponies!
Manny Franco lost the race!
I wouldn't call 8-1 a "massive" upset but still good for them.
My birthday's on 18th so I played Authentic (USA)  by Into the mischief,  at 9/1 odds. And boooooom, Take Jump Go Front. Unbeatable on the derby day.  What a great horse ! 🐴
Baffert  is the best   I make money on  his horse  all the time  he  is  the best  when  making money
I no longer need my job thanks to, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Better horse on the day manny franco rode a good race on tiz the law
Better horse on the day manny franco rode a good race on tiz the law
the Derby is racist, I'm sorry ....
Glad BLM didn't disrupt the race.
Felicidades
This is racist... non of the horses took a knee.... 😂😂😂😂😂
One of the favorites won. Not a massive upset idiot.
Ahhhhhh my friend is partial owner of Authentic!!!! Woooo
Authentic was second or third choice in the betting. That’s not a massive upset
Taiwan Silmitasertib
Baffert, the cheat, wins it again. Scumbag. By the way, what was Michael Smith and Barkley Tagg thinking? This was the worst strategy. Get away last?
Very fast KD. Don't know if the additional age on the horses had anything to do with it, or if Authentic is just that fast. Regardless, Tiz the Law never looked comfortable, while Authentic was very smooth and ran easy the whole race. Funny how living, breathing beings can be so unpredictable!
Had to watch the pre-race on NBC with no volume, too politically biased. Congratulations Mr Baffert and Authentic
Baffert's a legend.
I forgot all about it  I’m not into watching events with no spectators that’s like adjusting my mind to stupid.
2019 was a bigger upset
Don’t know anything about horse racing, but YouTube gave me several ads promoting Authentic, glad to see he came out on top.
Awesome
Very happy he didn't win, my TC is 3 races in 5 weeks, Covid ruin the TC so it's fitting we have no TC winner given how the schedule made it easier...
Tiz was 3/5 favorite in the Derby, those are rare odds for the Kentucky Derby!!  My pockets got heavenly upset by Authentic!!!!😕
$ over life
The favorite has only won 49 times out of 150 years bet accordingly
That race was all authentic
Great race
Click bait!  Not a massive upset.  Call me when the 65-1 horse wins.
We have to wait now for the samples...is not over yet .
Congratulations Authentic, John Velazquez and Bob Baffert for a spectacular upset  and win yesterday! Say what you want about Bob Baffert,  he is a magnificent trainer he knows his horses, he knows how to train, and prepare for big events time after time.  I have the utmost respect for this man and scholar of horse racing.
Best 2 minutes in sports...
hope you had a happy day bob best wishes
After picking you months ago you didn't let me down. Thanks Authentic!
An 8/1 shot winning isn't a massive upset!  If you got a 50/1 or 100/1 winner then that's a massive upset!
sam the cooking guy
Kentucky derby, such an disrespect to Breonna!
Baffert needs to be banned for life, how many times does he get off the hook for milk shaking the horses!!  Enough with the bullsheet already!!  Same with Assmussen and many others!!
My dad bet 7,000k on tiz and 3,500k on authentic.
Hunter S. Thompson brought me here
I put 1000.. On tiz and honors AP exacta. 1000 tiz and authentic exb. 2500 tiz! Lost! 350 dollars on authentic and a last second bet authentic and tiz exacta 200 bux and 75 to win on authentic.. Great day.. I knew authentic was gonna be great. I had some inside knowledge about him. He was gonna run great!
I’m Surprised that Authentic hanged on,  with such a struggle to get to the lead, he was even passed at the top of the stretch
Great fractions.
Ha, the caller was trying real hard to get Tiz the Law to win, but nope, Authentic won fair and square!
Wonder what Bob been feeding his horse?
I wish Mr big news (9) on the 2nd place,will be big money for me. By the way,of course authentic will win,always remember when J.velasques+ bob baffert =$$$$$$
Authentic showed some heart in the stretch holding Tiz off well. I wouldn’t call it a “Massive Upset” but, it was a good race. Bizarre without the crowd. Bob going down in the Winners Circle whole Authentic romped the Roses was pretty classic!
That was one gutsy effort by Authentic.  It looked like Tiz the Law had him at the top of the stretch, but he dug in and held off the odd-on favorite.  Don't ever sell Bob Baffert short.
Bob baffard Is a genius, apparently doing something right  kudos to him and his staff .
I'm happy for Authentic but this was the saddest Derby I've ever seen. Nobody was there! All to stoke a virus hoax. When is this gonna end.
Was anyone else watching Honor A.P. (16) the whole time? I watched him get bumped on the start, and he was basically in last for the first half of the race, but he made a big comeback and finished in 4th.
Congrats to Authentic, great run! Get rid of that announcer, he's awful.
Larry Collmus was fooled but gathered himself just in time. When Tiz the Law drew even at about the quarter pole Collmus raised his voice and was just about to say something about Tiz the Law surging into the lead, until he realized Authentic wasn't going anywhere. I'm thrilled Barclay Tagg lost after that comment the other day about who is allowed to shoot whom. Talk about a combination of ignorant and tone deaf.
Control antidoping bob=💉 drug
Baffert had AUTHENTIC full cranked for this one. TIZ THE LAW simply doesn't like Churchill Downs and it shows yet again. JOHNNY V did a excellent job nursing AUTHENTIC with that high cruising speed because after 22 to a 46 to a 1:10, I just didnt know how much he had left in the tank. But he proved all the Horse Racing experts wrong today.
Tiz The Law forgot one thing . It's year 2020 🙄
I got the memo: the rich don't wear masks.
Tiz the law is just another average horse and probably won't run again this year. Most forgettable Derby ever 👎
I thought BLM SHUT THEM DOWN. LMFAO
NBC AND THERE FAKE NEWS!! MASSIVE UPSET!! LOL
I got a new tradition for the men of this race where cowboy hats
Any horse running a horse race gets exhausted in the final stretch of a race , but as tradition has it , you whip it with a crop to make it go faster . Inflicting pain on a beloved horse to push it harder past its physical limits seems cruel  . Swinging  that crop as hard as they can , as they always do , so they might win a race , at the horses expense . Outlaw crop whipping and run on merits . Or let spectators use  whips on their favorite marathon runners , to speed them up . Oh..it hurts too much . So what .
wearing masks during the race.. .wtf.. you going to catch the virus while riding at 45mph?  morons
that last stretch looks a little strange... the law comes inside to nowhere almost makes contact, makes an awkward hard right to clear and then is the only ride that spends the rest of the straight lookin into the stands till right before the end when starts lookin downtrack again,,,  would like to get the owners take on all that...
Better ending then 2019s
Fix races.
Boricuas the best puerto rico....
This is Trump's fault!
authentic that’s my name
Authentic was AUTHENTIC!!!!!
Just noticed that the 15 swerved outside coming out of the gate and completely cut off Honor AP.  Then he has to come about 10 wide around the final turn to make his move.  Pretty nice run to end up 4th after giving the field a huge head start.
Mine That Bird was massive
BLM.  hee-hee, just kidding.
authentic down the stretch singing       breakin the law breakin the law
Looked to me like Tiz got outclassed. See him holding his head to the outside? Honor AP came running but near the end he hung like the rest of them. Yeah, he was eleven wide but you can't blame the horse, just Mike. Doubt he would have been there anyway. You can't say that Tiz had an off day, he just never looked a horse in the eye before. Nothing wrong with that, he didn't have to, until today. Had Uncle Chuck been ready he would have pissed on all of them. Yes, he bled in his last. Two more months til the BC. I'll shut up then.
Bafferts Juice is still working! I wonder which of his horses will drop dead next? Someone should start a betting pool for that.
Maybe 50 to 75 a year.
Tiz the Law couldn't do just finish 2nd good run .
1:46-1:47 you can see the mistake the jockey made
"Jimsonweed"🙄
Puerto Rico 1 and 2
Alright authentic let's see what you can do, can you go all the way? We'll see
10 Furlongs for Tbreds is a marathon race.  Tiz ran a great marathon 4 weeks ago at Saratoga.  Authentic came in off seven weeks rest after a 9 furlong race.  May not seem like much, but it is for both rest period and distance for a Tbred.  Give them each the same prep, my money goes on The Law!   I feel bad for the owners at Sakatoga.  But they have had a great run!   Hope these two meet again in KY at Keeneland!
Do not send your vote in the mail via USPS.  Bring it personally and drop it at the election precinct center.  demonc rats party will scam the election..m
No professional sports Let them protest themselves out of business
I was shocked
Did i miss something cuz how is it a upset if authentic was first for a while
who makes these names
The Derby needs a better track caller. Tom Durkin is really missed by this racing fan.
Was that an authentic race?
Honor AP got a sketchy ride. He should have been in the mix
I dont understand how a trainer who not only has 26 charges against him, but was just suspended for 15 days in July 2020 for doping his horse, was allowed to train a horse for the derby.  i really hope they tested the horse for banned substances
good race, but still, nothing like Secretariat.
I'm glad the derby was held in September. Better track conditions and no sloppy track! Great run today! 🐴
Thought it was gone say massive shooting coincidence?
THE massive upset was in 2009, with Mine That Bird. 50-1. That was my favorite race by far.
The coolest comb-over I ever seen congratulations Bob  authentic way to grind it out mr. Ed would be proud.
I ate horse meat when I lived in Quebec, good stuff.
Congrats Authentic...Baffert still got game!
Authentic was green in his early races,  still seems to fight it a little, but man what a training job by Bob B.--  and great- great ride by JVelasquez--  he let Authentic run his race---   cant wait for Breeders Cup
I'd name a horse No Glue 4U😱😱😱
If this horse  can not backup this performance he was juiced,I will give him credit right now but if he does not hit the the board in his next race red flags are going to fly.
Owners: Thank you horsey for the millions. Here is a carrot.
Umm.  8-1 is not a massive upset.
GOOD THAT BOB BAFFERT WON THE KENTUKY DERVY. SINCE NADAL HAD BEEN INJURED AND TALK WAS NOT. THAT GOOD WITH AUTHENTIC CONGRATULATIONS
I was gonna do the super with Big News, Law, AP and Authentic. Smfh. I did an ex and still won thoe.
Massive Upset coming November 3rd...
How is this a major upset?
juiced!
Poor animals. Race Industry destroys tens of thousands of horses annually. Blood sport 👎🏻👎🏻 should be outlawed.
I love the horses. They are God's most beautiful creatures. So very big and strong yet incredibly fragile.  Thank you God.
I was watching the grey with 4 white socks in practically last the whole time and come up in 4th.
Whats the point of this?
I know nothing about horse racing and have never watched one before. This youtube recommendation has me feeling like i should be here....
These guys are fast. I wonder how much horsepower they have....
Poor horses
Why ? It was a great race. I thought they would all crash and fall down or something.
You have to be KIDDING ME! Had to wear a MASK! Give me a break.  I actually think horse racing is cruel. I wish they would outlaw it.
I watched this live
That owner with the blonde hair wins every time
John Velasquez 🇵🇷 Puerto Rico
Whitest thing i ever seen
Whats going on with Baffert's horses?? Why was the other one so hyper it had to be taken out and the winner couldn't calm down after the race?
Pointless sport
This is a really nice game
Can’t believe a dog won it.  Truly an upset no one saw coming.
Sadhus Next. N.
8-1 bet
I can't believe we're still using/abusing horses for entertainment.
Is it normal for both Baffert horses to freak out?? First one flipped breaking some guys arm and then the winner flips out knocking Baffert down. Just asking as I haven’t seen that before.
No horses were harmed in the making of this Derby lol
💀💀💀
Great call just love it the call was better than the race made my hair stand on the back of my neck
They are beating the crap out of those horses
Ever notice the rich don’t wear a mask just tell you too??
Pretty boring!!  Plantation master racing,. Wheres mitch mcconnell ?
Johnny Rode a Masterful Race. Point blank period. While TTL came out good, Johnny waited to see what happens at start. Controlled the pace like he always do. Authentic's Pedigree shows he may get distance. TTL Belmont was also 3/8 of mile shorter than usual. These are all factors. Just like his obvious dislike for Churchhill. But if there was another speed horse in race it would have been different. Wide trip or not, TTL had opportunity to take lead and didn't. So Authentic did. The start of race is key to this whole thing
I miss Hazel Park raceway my dad and I pass time loved it👍🏾AUTHENTIC
Massive upset? 3rd choice. NBC sports sucks as much as it’s news division.
The upset would have been Mr. Big News winning, since he was the long shot.  Still, the long shot coming in 3rd is damned impressive.
It's not the same race without the fans and a full 20-horse field
Lots of people lost a lot of money on tiz the law
Am I the only one that knows very little about what’s going on?
Track announcer sucks.. Baffert blows.
At 8 to 1 odds that's not an upset. An upset would be if you lost to some horse at 23 to 1 odds.
Hoarse racing is dope
Love Bob Baffert!!!
Art collector would have won that
You should have taken the horse with the white streak on its face.
Why was Tiz the Law pulled hard to the left when he was about to overtake at last turn?
I don’t get it... wasn’t the horse that won the one in the lead almost the entire race? I was expecting some Hollywood twist...
Let me guess a white horse won the race and BLM can’t handle it?!
Horse racing should be illegal. Gross
Massive upset? Hardly
Why should i believe for his horse to win. Test that horse for drugs.
Horse lives matter
Amazingly powerful win! Congratulations, Authentic! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This was today?  I thought it was later this month.  Glad no horses broke down.  I used to love the Triple Crown until Barbaro broke down several years ago.  Haven't been able to watch until this video.
John velasquez. Grande
There’s no denying Baffort’s greatness.
was looking for the upset all throughout the video but couldn't find one. Is it name of any horse here?
Honor A.P got obliterated out of the gate
Brought to you by Longines ;)
So what's the upset.
Not too into horses unless theres a Brazilian chick with em
Who actually spends some of their time watching this
Cha-Ching!!!  I love when I am 99.9% sure and the race runs perfectly!   Baffert's big 6 KDs and I'm there for all of them!   The "Silver Fox" does it again!!!   Best ALL-TIME Trainer. Thanks Bob for the $$$$$
I’d bet on that horse for sure... “Massive Upset”
Why is this in my fucking recommend
WOW...  DID YOU SEE THE FORM OF THAT JOCKEY COMPARED TO THE OTHER JOCKEY???
Don't  bet against  Bob baffert  in a big race
Authentic first, Tiz The Law second... Hope O’Connell (aka The Turtle) was watching 😂
Baffert wins the Derby BFD. The Derby is run after the Belmont in September? Sad.
Larry Colmus gets on my nerves. Wish NBC just stuck with track call of Travis Stone
“NY Traffic” these names are always interesting.
How come no one's talking about Mr. Big News for showing? 46-1.
WHAT Island?!?!
Fake news??
Great Race! Very glad they finally got it done!
Authentic just dominated that race. Tiz the law got close but authentic said no sir not today. Great race!!!
racist crap
Sorry But, one again, Bob baffert says, CALIFORNIA IS CALIFORNIA BABE...
I really hope I am wrong because I love horse racing. But I am beginning to think its rigged. This same trainer has been winning to consistent for years. I hope I'm wrong.
Really guys? You are STILL  broadcasting this sh!t? Stop promoting such a CORRUPT industry.  This isn't a sport anymore.  It's a business.  With replaceable money making machines. Most of the horses bred go to SLAUGHTER. It is a corrupt industry at best.
More exciting than an nba game.
Nothing but fucking animal abuse! GET RID OF IT FOREVER!
Who cares?
Not a hug surprise for Bob Baffert and John Velasquez to win.. now if Mr. Big News had won that would have been an upset :)
Love the aerial
Beautiful 😪👍
Massive upset??? 8/1 beats a chalk in 15 field Derby - hardly an upset or shocking result!
Authentic always wins
Why is everybody acting like this races aren’t fixed?
8 to 1 is hardly a "massive" upset, get real...
Fake News headline as usual.  Shame.
Authentic was priced at 8/1..I know he beat the favourite, but it wasn’t a massive upset.
Hey NBC it was very disappointing that you decided to drag politics into the pre race show it doesn't belong. This sport is about these magnificent animals the thoroughbred. Not those fools protesting. So next year please concentrate on the horses  because we don't care about that other stuff. Horses are one of the only things left in this world that are pure & honest 🏇
Si éste caballo ganó, imagínense lo que iba a hacer NADAL o hasta el propio CHARLATÁN que son mejores que AUTHENTIC...
oh man I came to see if the rioters broke through the gates. You left me disappointed.
An 8/1 shot winning isn't a massive upset despite your ridiculous claim. It's a bit of a surprise but nothing more than that.
877 880ci9t4po4i0yt5.7ook
Where is bob bafferts mask??
Baffert didn’t wear a mask he should have to listen to CNN for 24 hours in a row with no bathroom breaks,
Bob juiced Authentic  Get that horse tested ASAP. Bob put on your mask u idiot lol
I'm so stoked and I won some good $!
Tiz might have made his move a little early. Ran out of gas in my opinion
The massive upset was 3rd place Mr Big Newa 46/1
Massive upset? Authentic had the 2nd best odds out of the 15 horses running..
How is this an upset? What a yawner.
Horse racing should be banned!
New York Traffic salió a ensuciarle la carrera a Tiz The Law y a taparlo hasta donde pudo. Largando por adentro era otra la historia para el favorito.  Igualmente que turf de mierda el yankee. El Nascar de los caballos.
Outside to first before the first turn.
*C L I C K  B A I T*
All these people talking about animal cruelty kill Me. Before there were cars everyone rode horses. All wars an movies you so loved are on horses. Ben Hur etc. Never heard outcry then.Indians bred Them,you have poli games,grand national,used for Farming. Now it's cruel because they race.GOH
Authentic won fair. Tiz tried hard to pass authentic but couldn't keep up with him, tiz ran out of gas.
alot of officials in oakland made alot of money on bobby's horse.....guess he's gna win the appeal at the end of the month!
It was great to watch a sporting event and not see BLACK LIVES MATTER propaganda littering up the landscape for a change.   I've still got horse racing.   So far.
Bob Baffert I'd the goat 🐐
The show horse ran a good race. I noticed halfway through it was cruising nicely without laboring at about middle pack. May be a horse with some good racing ahead.
It's  nice to know that somebody is making money and enjoying it while the rest of America needs at least enough money to pay their rent
Wasn't Baffert SUSPENDED for drugging his horses?  There are so many that drug horses that I can't keep count.
SECRETARIAT !!!!!  Hold records for Kentucky Derby, Preakness & Belmont.  Check out his Triple Crown races because they will blow your mind.  He STILL  CANNOT BE BEAT !!!
Hardly massive, AUthentic has steadily improved over the summer
Well Authentic's jockey was NOT BEATING his horse through the finish line that is why he won.. Just like human beings, if you want an animal to do something for you, then treat him with respect and kindness ....it works every time!!!! The jockey of the horse that came in second was literally BEATING  his horse through the finish line..what a disgrace!!!!
I didn't watch the Derby live on account of I saw one of the horses take a knee before the start.
NBC sucks
They taking this protesting stuff to far Horse racing has nothing to do with that stuff
Check history how many times race horses have been drugged, feet snapped and killed. Horse racing is not a sport. It's a bloody abuse to animals. Until the cruelty ends, please don't go to the racetrack ...
Just rich fucks playing with there money lol
Horse racing is evil.
Congrats to Authentic also sure Tiz The Law didn’t win but that’s the whole part of horse racing no one knows the outcome and it’s a mystery too
Leave it to NBC Sports to twist the narrative.
Click bait, how is an 8-1 shot a huge underdog.
Was authentic on the wrong lead coming down the stretch?
No mentioned of the black supremacist group NFAC making a march outside
It only goes to to tell a lot of jockey that hand ride and push a horse instead of whipping cost them the race
And it’s The Run for the Roses🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
New York traffic ran out of steam,wasn't jockeys Fault.After the clubhouse turn he didn't have the Kick. But kudos to the rest
Joe BIDEN hates black people
How can I get into being a horse jockey, I'm 6'1 230 lbs, will that be a problem?
Course not a mask among the rich blowhards
Yes that is a very misleading headline
Yawn.
dog racing gone or getting gone. this stuff next
Who writes the headlines? Authentic was a solid bet for a position in the money, easily.  a 50-1 horse would be a Huge Upset, but Authentic at 8-1 is hardly that.  Fake news everywhere you look.
Hmmm the law and order horse came in second in this race.  Foreshadowing November?
who the F even cares
I don't see any upset
I’m I the only one who HATES when they show too much overhead view during the race?
msnbc  continuing a long tradition of being clueless and spreading lies   this horse was one or 3 horses expected to win lol  not that surprising
don't mind me but isn't this a jojos reference?
Tiz the Law to have an Authentic wire to wire winner.
Authentic will beat "what the definition of is tiz" any day.  Tick-tock.
I’m so sick of these GTA Diamond Casino ads
The race is not for the swift, it's for who has the endurance to the end. Lets see what's gonna happen in the Preakness  & the Belmont Stakes, Got Luck for you all but specially for Sammy Camacho & Juan Carlos Avila.
i know you guys are trying to get massive views with your headline (i think it's called click bait) but it's not a massive upset...winner was 8-1 third choice. Massive upsets are Giacomo and Mine That Bird to name the two most recent Kentucky derby massive upsets.
Tiz ran outside the whole way, wrong strategy
Thanks YouTube for the highlights..👍
Baffort appears to have the formula, and feeding it to the horses?😂🤔
Wow, I thought the new gate was supposed to be so it could be set up more into the stretch. Looks like it was in the same place as the double gate.
He should train Mike Tyson for his comeback
Wouldn't call that a massive upset, the favorite finished 2nd place.  P.S. Massive Upset would be a great name for a horse :)
Really, NBC? You could have aired the last 20 laps of the NASCAR race and still had plenty of time for horse racing.
My exacta: 18, 17, 16. (Picks up satchel, trudges out of this thread).
Kentucky Rico Italiano come on down Rico Rico gave me the flyer
I think Manny didn't push hard enough in the homestretch ! He should have used both hands!
Its trumps fault.
Nice to have an upset once and awhile
Let's see,  college football , European   football, baseball.  Basketball
The results could of been different if King Guillermo took place, that would of been a big upset and would of brought some joy to all Venezuelans.
I wish they pet the horses more to say thanks
Fast horsies
guisado de bola por el jinete
Authentic living up to his name.
Boy Authentic really ran that race! Fantastic Derby
BLM and antifa are terrorists
Daddy just paid off his mortgage!
Undisputed,original  horse!
A massive upset. Kind of like the way that Donald Trump is gonna upset the election. Democrats can’t win now unless they cheat or Trump passes away.
The silver fox does it again. What a ride by Johnny Velazquez!!!
CV-109 is a pure BS! WAKE THE F UP! A microscopic 'bug' in spit, that when you cough, can be transferred to another person and make them sick, HAS NEVER BEEN PROVEN! F-A-C-T! I'll stick to actual virologists and microbiologists on the subject. The rest of you can believe that idiot box...
American ferro horse
Where's the massive upset? You fucking morons.
Authentic showed guts when he hit the top of the lane, a great performance. Congrats to the Baffert connections..
Wait the whole thing only lasts 2 minutes? This is what people freak out over? A bunch of horses running for 2 minutes?
I was at the edge of my seat great race
Baffert probably drugged this horse as well. Justify should of been disqualified and bolt d oro with the winnings. Baffert recently had 2 horses drugged at oak lawn and he's appealing. Dirty sport with the horse being the victim.
This would be the perfect event for some drone technology, of course as long as it didn't interfere with the race.  But wouldn't it look cool to have some close ups of the different horses as they were racing.   (Or maybe instead that roving cam like in the NFL.)  Also, I would think some light unnoticeable cameras placed on the rider's caps that had video stabilization would make for some really cool footage (or maybe tied to one of the horse's front straps).
I wonder how many people lost money and ruined there lives. Should’ve known better than betting money on a race in 2020!!!
And around the 3rd turn it’s 😴
who even watches derby anymore lol
Title says “massive upset.” He was the second choice! Stupid media.
I usually follow racing pretty closely (I have watched every Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont States since I was 3 years old) but this year things kind of got messed up and racing was put on the back burner. Today my mom tells me, "You know it's the Kentucky Derby today, right" That's when I realized, "I haven't picked a horse yet!" I crash studied for an hour before the race all of the horse running and to me, Authentic was the one. This is the 7th year in a row that my pick has won the Kentucky Derby and my dad has doubted my pick every year.(it's kind of a tradition 😂) This year though, my dad just looked at me after Authentic crossed the finish line and said, "You... me...we are going to start betting"
WHO EVER NAMED NY TRAFFIC WAS A G!! BUT SAD HE GOT STUCK IN TRAFFIC IN THE RACE:(
The race was great but as usual NBC had to ruin it with all of there Left wing lies and Propaganda WOW NBC want to steal all our joy WOW AND DOUBLE WOW just CRAZY
El único que le podía ganar...Y le ganó...!!!! Felicidades John Velázquez....México city...
animals being abused yay!!!!!🤦🏼‍♀️
Whooooooo!!!!
I love horse racing 🏇 💵
Am I the only one who doesn't care?
2:13 the guy is wearing his mask wrong.
That wasn't a massive upset the horse was 8 to 1 on the odds ,any in the top five had a chance .
Great race! 👍
why aren't the elitest owners wearing face mask? know something we peons don't
In 2010 Mike Smith rode Zenyatta in the Breeders Cup Classic which was the last leg of the pick six where I had singled Zenyatta.  Same poor ride today on Honor A.P. thankfully it didn't cost me the $120,000 it did back in 2010. Hey Mike RETIRE.
MR. Big News killing it for trifecta box players $$$
Wow. Many Congratulations 🎉🍾🎈🎊 to Authentic and his owners. He is a masterpiece.
Horse lives matter. Sad
The second time Tiz The Law failed to quicken and both times it was at Churchill. Manny thought he had a lot of horse underneath him because on approaching the top of the straight he looked behind him. Authentic fan a good  race but this wasn't Tiz The Law best race, don't think we will ever see him at Churchill again.
Unfreakinbelievable. Only Baffert could have one horse flip in the paddock, watch it be scratched, and end up winning with his other horse. Tiz was the lock of the decade, what happened? That's why they run the race.
Too bad Honor AP got hipchecked at the gate. Amazing to finish 4th
All I know is if the horse owned by the black guy didn't win, I declare racism...
I'm not a horse guy but I love watching horse races. They are amazing.
AUTHENTIC BROKE THE LAW
You know the guy in second place is gunna shoot that horse in the head
Of course its bob baffert
I think the reason they say it's a massive upset is because Tiz The Law was the favorite to win the kentucky derby especially after he won the Belmont I don't think it's based too much on the odds because Authentic's odds weren't too bad
YEEESS Authentic I picked him months ago for the Kentucky Derby and kept believing in him even though Tiz the Law and Honor AP are both also really good. They all ran really well, Honor AP had a terrible trip but made up so much ground still in the stretch. Great race!
Ends with all the horses and riders dying of The Chinese Wuhan virus and Democrats blaming it on President Trump!
It’s not the same without the crowd.
The "massive upset" part of the title was to get clicks.
Wow, well done!!!
Isn't anyone questioning why both of Bob's horses gave trouble?  He was suspended in July for two horses testing postive for banned substances. That's a serious concern for me. 🐎😯🤨
Lawlessness runs wild !
What’s the “massive upset” everyone seemed pretty happy
Just pure animal exploitation!!!
Jeeeeeez Baffert!!! Nice run Authentic!
Did the horses take a knee before the race?
No mention of the Marxist terrorist group BLM agitating outside the gates "no justice no Derby" they say. Stand in front of the horses
A horse winning 8-1 is not a massive upset at all. Also Tiz the Law had a chance to the very end.
had authentic to win and did win... but you must remember a lot of horse races are so corrupt my friend is a jockey retired and he explained that the trainer told him I make more money falling of horses than winning this is 100 % true in the united kingdom the British horse racing authority is complete farce its corrupt as also with Irish horse racing and bias in my view if you want to win at the British horse racing think like a criminal that way you will have more chance of getting a win if your going to have a bet on the real big races like Kentucky derby  and king George there more honest  after all the price money in the united kingdom for every day racing is only about £3.2795 its pathetic   its not horse racing its corrupt in my view think like a criminal that way you have a good chance of getting a win the horse racing authority try and tell you something but in my view its all false information dont listen to what the horse racing authority tells you its a pile of muck sack
I hope NBC goes to the glue factory with all of the losing horses. They cut off the Xfinity for five hours of this crap which only lasts a minute.
Ground sure is dry!
Its is a true upset!!! Authentic sire is Into Mischief who never sired a horse at that distance 1mile and a quarter. He is known for sprinting and a mile. The professional bettors and handicappers all said he was distance limited. Look it up., they said he was a toss. LMAO. The jockey give him a Magnificent ride!!!!  The horses class( previous G1 winner) , freshness and jockey made the difference.   Remarkable he beat TiZ the Law,  who look far superior to everyone in the field, on paper and previous victories.
Was that a job at the start on the 2 west coast horses  TIZ THE LAW CHURCHILL JINKS  CONTINUES  BOB BAFFERT G O A T
What cus there horses in Kentucky
I heard the horses stood for the anthem. At least I can watch one sport.
I see Ann Coulter wasn't in this race... Oh well, maybe some other time...
poor horseys
Very very very great conduction by Johnny Velásquez.
How is 8/1 a massive upset? Dipshits
massive upset??? 8 to 1 shots win everyday
Fucking rich people lol
I love the horse races, when I was a kid my dad would hook up the boat and tell my mom we were going to the lake.....so she wouldn’t get mad. We were the only people in the parking lot with a boat at the horse races.
Bob + drugs = derby win I thought he was banned after he got caught .. Not once but twice
Massive is not 8/1. 50/1 is massive for further races NBC.  Stop begging for a click.
I still think this animal abuse but hey you like it I love it
No way this horse can go a mile and a quarter. Bob Baffert “hold my beer.”
TRUMP 2020
8-1 third choice is a "massive upset"
Clearly not a massive upset, liars.
not that massive of an upset I expected him to be pace leader but just not hold it through the whole race
I know nothing about the world of horse racing. What's the massive upset?
F NBC
Horrible news reporting fake headlines draw attention
Stop abusing and exploiting innocent animals! Look how exhausted and distressed those horses look. A bunch of insecure men trying to prove their masculinity by using and exploiting innocent animals. So disgusting! And disgusting are the people that pay to watch this! If this is your entertainment, you're sick.
I thought it was going to be cancelled because some group said they were going to burn the city down
Idiots wearing masks!
Nobody died, nobody got hurt.
Thanks for the spoiler headline.
The best part is that not a single horse knelt befor the event
Boy why can they not takw away all those whips?
Secretariat is the king. 2015 horse is dam good.Bob you are the man.
Man I was sure Tiz would get it.
Good to see the pandemic doesn’t put a stop to needless animal abuse 👍🏼
3rd win in 6 years is considered a massive upset?
Silence is not golden. OMG
Wow!  That was exciting!  Good health to all!
Seems like BLM had yet another failure. They didn't stop the Kentucky Derby after all. BTW, Authentic's jockey is Latino which makes it even sweeter😂😂😂
I don''t know why this came up in my recommendeds, but I must say that when I saw "massive upset" at a horse race, I did expect some horse to die mid-race. I'm glad it's not that, but for sure I was prepared to be massively upset by a sport I don't follow.
Not for the winner ;)
Imagine tailgating for hours before a football game.  Then picture yourself in the stadium watching the kickoff with only a 3 minute game clock.  Each team has a minute and a half to score.  Then game over.  Most of your time was spent tailgating.  That's the Kentucky Derby.
As good as Tiz the law is he cant beat maxumum security...i knew it even before this race
Congratulations
Mr.Big News swung way wide into the last turn...otherwise might have been right in there...Authentic...led the entire way... Curious as to the delay...if it had any sort of an affect...toward the outcome???
Yet again I can’t believe it hahaha
Boring!!!
I should’ve betted on this, I fricken predicted that Authentic would win
Wow! What a horse!
In horse racing,as well you do all your best,yes,you win all loss ,doesnt matter,all are the best.
Joe Biden just made the outrageous lie I have ever heard. Joe says " Edison did not invent the light bulb. A black man did,"  A total lie. A black man who worked for Edison improved how the filament worked.  That is all they did .  let's get this lie straight Joe Biden.  Edison invented the light bulb .  Case closed.
Baffert always has the best drugs!
Tiz the law i love you .you num one in my book🐅🐅🐅🐅
Alright but why was this event being protested?
Essentially gate-to wire after a 22.4 quarter at CD 10furlongs...very rare indeed! Mighty impressive.
The soberest Kentucky Derby in history !!
Congrats to Authentic!
This was not a “huge upset.” Authentic was the 2nd choice. Terrible headline
""""""massive upset"""""""
Great run by Authentic but not a "massive upset" like the caption says. He was at 8-1. Fake news.
Dont get me wrong, I like horses, but aftet 6 hours of pre race coverage, they could have shown every race in Kentucky Derby history,  again just saying.
These horse names man 🤣😂 I can't. "NY Traffic" "Tiz The Law" What?? 🤣🤣
A+ to Authentic, and a very good ride by the jockey.  Tiz The Law lost due to running too wide for most of the race.
Not really a "massive" upset.  Odds were second best at 8-1.
Finally something "Authentic" this year! Yeah boy! 🔥
Hopefully the same goes for the Kentucky Senate race.
I Fuckin hate NBC aerial shot
Rich man sports
Tiz the law tried his best but u got to remember who trains Authenthic
Great race
I actually won on a 60$ on WPS.
Tix the Law ran like a true New Yorker. 😌
COMING TO A CHAZ NEAR YOU /z\
What a great race!! And the Stewart's kept there mouths shut woohoo
King bob🏇
Funny how all the so called experts got it wrong. Not one of them got it right.
Bob Baffert you need to set an example, put a mask on buddy...and don't hug so much without one.
I wonder how bad do they have to beat up the horses to  obey and run for their life. How sad
Bob Baffert has won again 🤢🤢
Ashley Schaeffer does it again! WOO!!! WO!! Wo...
Tiz the law waited to long to make his move and then had nothing left in the tank to push, this is what happens when you wait to long to have races instead of doing your normal schedule
I think that as far as NBC is concerned, anyone other than Tiz the Law winning this race is considered a massive upset.
Damm smith cost me $$ honor AP was like in Lexington talk about a Saturday stroll dammm he just had too much ground to make up ..  Disappointing
Authentic = Trump 2020 Tiz the law = Biden
Bob had spare roids he couldn't get into Gamine
More than 1 full second off Secretariats time.
Decadent and Depraved
Afleet Alex is the best non triple crown winner  horse I have ever seen! 🐎 (won 2 of the 3)
I am no fun at a horse race.  I want all of them to win.
Congrats to Authentic and connections!! TTL looked loaded and hung, still ran game though, MBN ran on strong for third!! Honor AP, well..... Mike Smith thought it was the 2009 Classic on Zenyatta, don’t know what he was doing with that horse smh
Where's the upset? They looked pretty happy to me .
AND???
Who the train the winner
I thought the kentucky derby was in May?
Lo que dijo Alfredo domingue nunca a ganado un caballo x el puesto 17
Authentic hung up a 1,106f and said,, try to close on this!
Fake News
I was just there, working at the track...it was SO WEIRD without the spectators!  We missed y’all, and hope to see you next year!
Fake news
Valiant effort by Tiz the Law but looked tired and her move should have come a bit sooner in the race...she was struggling...you can see it on the video just at the signaled moment to let her run.  Too little -too late.
He is a baby Justify!
Big win for Johnny Velazquez🇵🇷. Good performance by Manny Franco🇵🇷. Kentucky Derby 2020🇺🇲
Authenic had all the way what a BEAST AWESOME NO PROBLEM FOR HIM
Baffert pwns
They were ignoring Authenic in the analyst I had a feeling he would he there Bafferts house 6times winner I didn't get too bet wouldn't have been much congrats BAFFERT YOUR GENIUS
King Bob is the GOAT!
Just won $840 on that. Easiest money I’ve ever made
Great job by jockey to get the lead and just cruise on the lead and then shake loose on the lead on the well conditioned Authentic for the WIN!
I have always liked Authentic and thought he was underrated, however, 8-1 is NOT a massive upset ...
I wonder how much trump put on the 🏇🏇🏇🏇🏇🏇🏇🏇🏇🏇🏇🏇🏇🏇🏇🏇😁
Brillante triunfo. Gran carrera VIVA EL TURF.
I fought the law and the law lost
Tiz the Law was clearly tired. Baffert is smart, he keeps his horses lightly raced. Honor AP had a terrible trip, looked like Zenyatta all over again. Good win for Auth.
Got to love Authenthic. The upset for me was NY Traffic. I think Tiz The Law ran a great race, but I don't think he's a fan of Churchill Downs.   In addition, I think that this year, in all of the races held at Churchill Downs today, the favorites were not on top of their game.   Very excited to see who is going to be crowned the Preakness Winner.
King Baffert does it again.
Tiz the Law didn’t have his usual late kick and it was a great ride by Johnny V!  Baffert is a master at getting these 3 year olds to peak at the right time.
Authentic was my original favorite to win several months ago. As my handicapping skills improved, I dropped him in favor of others like Tiz, but I still had the belief he could possibly pull it off, and the hope that he just might. THIS, was an absolute miracle, and the best moment of the summer. WELL DONE!!!! :D
Authentic was AUTHENTIC tonight!....but still, SECRETARIAT would have given him dust. Nobody beats BIG RED.
No the commentator wins the kentucky derby as always
Does bob baffert give them drugs cause he always wins
Awesome 👌 🆒️.
Why do I have goosebumps.these are horses running.
“Massive upset” he was the 3rd choice 😂
Authentic was 8-1, that was NOT a massive upset. Nice ride by Johnny V.
NEW KENTUCKY DERBY CHAMPION AUTHENTIC (RACEHORSE) 0:00 0:01
Tiz the law: I’m the favorite to win Authentic: lmao no
NASCAR needs to race at Churchill Downs, change my mind.
Wow
