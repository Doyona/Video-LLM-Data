David Matas, a Canadian human rights lawyer, received numerous threats after he started to expose forced organ harvesting by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). One such incident occurred at the host’s office in Brisbane, Australia, on October 29, 2010. An airgun projectile was fired from a passing car, damaging the window glass. Fortunately no one was hurt.  “I would say that there is a pattern of intimidation, but it doesn’t normally descend to the level of shots,” recalled Matas.  Another incident occurred at the event venue, also in Brisbane, when he received a phone call from a CCP Internet police officer.  “What you are doing now has put your life in danger,” said the officer, “Aren’t you afraid?”  If the officer did not like the speech, he should go ahead and stop the organ harvesting in China, instead of murdering the messengers, replied Matas.  He was threatened after launching the efforts in 2006 to expose the CCP’s crime of organ harvesting from living Falun Gong practitioners. After all, if it was not real, why was the CCP panicking trying to keep him silent?

10 Of The World's Funniest One Liners!  1. Few women admit their age; few men act it. 2. If everything is coming your way, then you're in the wrong lane. 3. Why is "abbreviation" such a long word?   4. The Big Bang Theory: God Spoke and BANG! it happened.  5. You can't have everything; where would you put it?  6. Nobody's perfect. I'm a nobody. 7. Nothing is fool proof to a sufficiently talented fool. 8. Who is "General Failure" and why is he reading my hard disk?  9. The more people I meet, the more I like my dog.  10. Everywhere is walking distance if you have the time.    Editorial: Maybe the most thought-provoking one-liners is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
