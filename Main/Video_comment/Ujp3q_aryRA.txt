the MASSIVE WEIGHT is really obvious. It's a giant lead sled with 1000 (electric) ponies.  at least the weight is very low in the chassis. sliding rather than rolling over lol. amazing lap time for such a heavyweight tank. I see one at a dealer near me for $49k and I take note.
Impressive at the time, but the car had to be heavily modified. The Model S wasn't a stock car. Now, the 5N in its stock condition did it only few seconds slower at less than half the price of this thing.
Family car btw
Where are all the other cars ????
7:03 the speedometer on the   gauge cluster is a whole 10 above the one mounted on the wheel
4 metric tonnes
Nice video !
I hope they leave the tyre industry alone. The only sound that has left us to enjoy.  The mothafuckas even took the steering wheen as well 😜
RIP RIMS😌😌
No gear changes, no engine rumble...........boring crap
Comento antes de ver el vídeo 😅 estoy seguro que es muy rápido en rectas 1/4 milla y eso pero aquí lo dudo que pueda manejar sus 1000+ hp como un súper auto, seguro no le gana al Pagani zonda R 6:47.00
Carbon ceramic brakes surely?
the speedometer numbers like Knight Rider in SPM mode! :D
Plaid into battery degradation 😂
Cuanto tiempo hizo ?
1:58 - 2:07 effing fighter jet man. I’m definitely in the minority when I say this but that over a regular engine sound any day.
That booty was clenched the whole time
the battery whine is cooler than loud engine noises to me
Wirklich unangenehm, wie mies dieses Schiff zu fahren ist.
Battery weight is the only thing holding this back. Imagine what it will do when its battery weight gets cut in half.
That steering wheel is ridiculous
Like a glider. Very wierd.
So the FL5 Honda Civic Type R lapped it in 7:44 on the new longer Nordschleifr circuit, which makes it about 6 seconds faster than a heavily modified tesla model S plaid lol. The Type R has a 2 litre 4 cylinder turbo engine and its front wheel drive. And it doesn’t have a DSG gearbox, it’s got one of the best 6 speed manual transmissions in any car in the world, and it only has 330hp and 420nm of torque. Long live the internal combustion engine! And the model 3 performance lapped it in over 10 minutes. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Oh, and the Honda civic type R was stock. All it had was a set of Michelin cup 2 sport tyres on it, other than that, it came from the factory floor. And I bet the type R has a lower carbon footprint than that Tesla. And it costs around $45k US. Meanwhile, the carbon ceramic brakes on this Tesla were completely destroyed after just 1 lap. The type R would have happily kept on lapping that circuit for the rest of the day. Teslas suck
To be able to do that with a family sedan,that’s comfortable for every day driving, sub 100k is awsome
That car scares the f*ck out of me. The sheer torque and acceleration.
Typical American car, everything for the 0-60 in straight but nothing when it comes to take a turn
Interesting if Tesla asked this race driver what he think about this parody on the steering wheel? Hope such steering wheels will be banned in Europe I hope cuz this is just dangerous and looks ugly.
@ElonMusk @Tesla Coming for you! You will not have enough security!
7:35 is a pretty bad ass time if you ask me. The driver had the biggest balls
Next video, Tesla's autonomous drive around the Nürburgring with a time record?
電車が走ってるかと思った。一周走っただけでお疲れ様と言いたい。
What a load of crap, give me a v8 anyday.
i imagine his entire family including dog is in the car with him and he was like alright let me just get one round real quick
I love how he makes the car rotate. Absolute masterpiece.
It sucks not having the sound and the rumble of an engine in a race car
นี่มันไม่ไช่รถแล้ว นี่มันจรวด ชัดๆ
I've never wanted to look up the address of game designers more than when I was just trying to play the rest of Gran Turismo 4. Finished license tests for my friend that had a ps1 for GT1 and 2 and could never finish this hellscape without touching a pixel of turf.
1 lap battery will be dead
Vidyakul team tane chhode nai samji.leje 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈
Amaru study su kaam bagade 6 laaa
Yeah sure it beat the record and whatever but the lack of soul is scary
You can see the exact moment he browns them pants at the end of the
Simply horrible handling.  Elon has F1 people helping with the vehicles Aero design... he should get someone from Porsche over to help with suspension.  I'm sure for a certain price, someone would come over to Tesla.  Much better chance Tesla wont be bankrupt and Porsche may very well be bought by the Chinese at some point.
In "Fast and Furious", they said "no replacement for displacement", but the engineers at Tesla knew that having all that gas sloshing around was slowing the car down. When this video came out almost 3 years ago, that's when people stopped saying "no replacement for displacement".
Like they say…”Professional Driver Closed Course”, when Knuckleheads do this in LA it turns out somewhat different 😂  https://youtu.be/ZNiEPPVefUE?si=iI_f7qQ5bpPcPvu_
خردة 😂😂 وتحيا BMW
Does this model s not have the track package?  It’s only hitting 160’s.
Giving hit the absolute BEANS and you can hear him sniffing here and there, that's wild AF. Great effort my guy, you are super skilled.
It definitely feels like it's not supposed to be driven like that. 😂
Scary as all hell. Fat car cant stop or corner. Dude is lucky to be alive.
Poor driving. There's too much steering. Try to reduce steering
Question: At the 4:27 mark there is a change in the roadway surface- something I’ve never noticed before in the hundreds of these videos I’ve watched. The change occurred on a sharp turn. Is the change in surface designed to create better friction? Is it a visual warning of the turn’s apex? Just wondering. Cheers from Boston ☘️
Utterly soulless :(
Freaking great driver !! wtf
Honestly dunno why Tesla put this video on, it doesn't make the plaid look good at all.  Anything approaching that amount of power needs to be way sub 7 minute, let alone 7.5.   Just goes to show, EVs have a great trick up their sleeve, it's called drag performance. Don't bother trying the track, really it underperforms hugely.
7:35.5 with 1100 hp under perfect conditions is actually damn slow. A Corvette C6 Z06 (505 hp, manual transmission, rear wheel drive, developed in the mid 2000s) has a lap time of 7:22. 😂
This video makes me petrified of being in that car. sounds like he's a second away from a deadly crash. At 1:25 omg
Taycan Turbo GT has entered the chat..
Tyres: I'm tired, boss.
Wow It takes along time to go to the finish
Now put Max Verstappen
It’s good to think from another perspective. He puts profits down for the sake of sales. fart. As long as sales are high enough. So that they have enough mileage to test. And then get a breakthrough. So if the stock price drops now, continue to buy. Just wait for her to break through. Ushered in a surge in stock prices. And Musk is a person who can own multiple companies. Still achieving in one year what others achieved in eight years. So even if we take it as a fool we only have to wait 3-5 years because. As long as he doesn't die during this time. You can do things that others can do in 21, 24-35, or 40 years. Everyone looked down upon him more and more. After 3-5 years, the face will be very swollen. As long as their funds can support it for five years. Musk also survives five years. Then success will only be inevitable. When she successfully piloted herself. You are thinking that the purchase price should be at least 3 times higher than the current price. Maybe even 10 times better. How much do taxi drivers in the world earn. There are also profits from the food delivery industry. logistics. What if I could still fly? Aircraft is also a market that can be captured. And sea, land and air. With all logistics. Takeaway industry. You investors are so smart. I guess people may withdraw their money only if they live at the bottom of a well. . I guess Buffett. Charlie Munger's company should have secretly bought him.
What I want to know is, why is that tesla keycard not moving around  ?
I was expecting someone passing him
Impressive, but there's just something missing. Oh yeah, engine rpms, gear changes and that magical sound of a performance exhaust.
Did you set the track pack ??
He needs to go FASTER to hit these corners properly
It may be his  tactis to famous . u can say u have pain in teeth  and doctor advised u to not fight.  U can say this just before two day.
Hahahah look at how lose the steering is and the tires begging for life 😂😂😂😂 just crap
This is not a car for the environment. It’s a waste of energy. An electric car must have low power high mileage pro charge. This is like the joke of the teenager “Who has the longer dick?”
I opted for the Model S with a yoke! BUT: It seems like Tesla is becoming the victim of it’s success in Europe!   Here’s a sad Tesla Belgium story: Tesla here really needs to be aware they are systematically pissing off customers by being completely unreachable for them! This is very bad for their growing business…  Here’s my story:  1. I ordered a Tesla Model S LR with FSD more than 2 years ago and about one month ago it finally arrived @zeebrugge harbour. Wow! 🤗  So, I arranged financing, insurance etc…   Finally, last friday, I was invited to Tesla Bruges for the handover.   On thursday I received an alarming mail: “Please do NOT come to Bruges tomorrow. Your car cannot be woken up on the parking.”  Since then, not any news and nobody can be reached @Tesla !  Can anybody here advise how I can proceed to find someone who want to help a desperate customer???  2. Also my youngest son has no trust anymore in Tesla Belgium:   He ordered a Model Y and received it last week. However, he has lots of technical issues because of his (Android) phone app not being able to communicate yet…  And nobody at Tesla Belgium was able to help him… No communication is possible, even with service and roadside assistance.  Now he is not able to use the navigation system and many other functions so that he can’t take his family on an eagerly awaited roadtrip through Europe…  PS: I am a fierce Tesla supporter (and investor) since over 10 years, but my belief in Tesla Belgium is sinking fast under sealevel… 😣
500 more horsepower and still slower than a Porsche ☠️ straight-line-only performance much? 💀💀
Model S Plaid and even Model X Plaid make super and hyper cars look pathetic and obsolete.
Now the first Tesla Plaid in Europe has been tested at the Nurburgring, and it was a disaster. It had dangerous flaws in the handling, suspension, and what was described as "LETHAL" brakes that lasted for 2 laps. Which is exactly as long as the battery lasts.   Which proves this car.... Was NOT a real Tesla Plaid. Not by any stretch of the imagination.
love how because you cant hear a traditional engine noise the tyre noise is really accentuated. What a car. 🤯
Must have given the pads and discs a good work out.
Fast car, not a performance car.
la lavadora dicen luego, en fin...
Vaybe
Same time as the M3 Touring. Half the power. The little RS3 only 5 seconds slower, fraction of the price. On that basis: this tesla is crap.
Am i the only one thinking Tesla are running strange in sport conditions ? Tried a Model 3 Propulsion, god it sticks the road but there's something that is not balanced in these cars and doesn't give much confidence to drive a bit stronger. It's bumpy, a bit blurry, doesn't really know where it wants to go. You don't feel leaned against the road that much especially in curves and during chain of curves. The rear axle is like "yeah i'm following, but as i can folks !". It feels like it's about to take off, but it doesn't really. Until it will, and it will be too late at this time. It's confusing. The chassis need some improvements for these conditions. For the rest, feels really appreciable and safe.
No sound
This car now cost $105k. And you can choose a classic steering wheel if you don't like yoke. 😉
The base model Audi RS3 did a better lap time lmao
What was the final time?
Who is the pilot?
doesnt look too composed to me
Porsche 919 Hybrid Evo siker
Very good hands 🙌
Audi RS3
This is weird and boring at the same time. And why is there a giant plasma screen stuck to the dashboard?
The tires gave their life for this lap and the time isn't even good, about time tesla makes a track version of the model s plaid or track-based model
Круто!
when you delete the car sound file from the game:
Slower than the Taycan Turbo S time around the ring.
It just don't sound right....
Those tires squealing more than they do in Gran Turismo
AH AH AH AH MAX SPEED 265 ...AH AH AH AH
POWER IS NOTHING WITHOUT CONTROL AND IDIOT TESLA HAVE NOT GOOD TYRES , NOT GOOD BRAKES AND NON GOOD OTHER RACE COMPONENTS. AMEN.
CAZZO VA AL RING CON QUELLE GOMMINE DI MELMA CHE HA. TESLA NON HA NE ASSETTO E NE RUOTE. E' UN CANCELLO SU RUOTE.
what a weird like   alien experience , it seems so foreign to be flying at like 100 mph and not hear a single noise from the engine bay yk.
What's the autopilot time though? cuz that's the most sterile drive I've seen in that track when comes to POV
Man merkt das auto ist nicht für den Nürburgring geeignet. Wie das Auto allein zu kämpfen hat
1020 PS und nur 270 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I think that wheel which they try to call a yoke, is problematic.
Ein Bisschen Emotionslos weil kein Motorsound.ich kann mir nicht vorstellen, dass so Auto fahren Spaß macht, wenn das die Zukunft ist. Aber die Beschleunigung ist mega
Drive like a very Big Boat
Steering movements as if there was no air in the tires
the silence is amazing
Wow, I would probably take TWENTY-seven minutes for that, even in the same car.
das ist einfach nur krank, so was darf nicht an anfänger verkauft werden
That's a really chill 270 kmh!
What parts have to be replaced after this drive?😂
Why isn't FSD doing the work?  Surely Elon hid the "Lap Mode" option?
The sounds of the original Gran Turismo😂
It’s no Porsche..
I feel like he is a great professional driver, but he does not understand the braking capability... Maybe a heat issue, but he has so many opportunities to open it up and it felt conservative.  LOVE the video
that steering does not look suitable for the track
The driver's skill is extraordinary.  The car...not so much in my opinion.  I like the sound of an internal combustion engine and a round steering wheel.  But I'm old school that way.  However, I am softening a bit on my stance with the non-manual cars (although my weekend car has to be a manual).
You ca hear the tyres struggling with that monstrously heavy thing. They must have been torched by the end of the lap.
what tires did they have installed here? Hopefully with better batteries they can lower the weight
Kmh?
A Tesla is no Porsche.  Good luck to the driver!
Is this track not smooth? Why so shaky on the steering wheel, does this Tesla have an alignment or suspension issue? I'd like to see an inside video of an actual Pro Driver test a late model Corvette, Camero, Challenger, and a big heavy late model Cady.
me in asetto corsa
that why tesla didn't need commercial ads for selling they cars
The car handles like a brick!
No sé ustedes, pero a mi me encantan los autos silenciosos
Is that mph or kmph?
Tesla will really do anything with their unfathomable cars!
Bwahaha it can hardly do more than 150mph. So Elon, where's the big 'f**k you' you promised to the internal combustion engine?
These cars are too dangerous for Nürburgring. I cant drive without sound.... cant explain it but its dangerous AF. Also dude you must change your GPS  to a fixed rotate :D
C'est très impressionnant !
boring af
Yeah after 2 laps like that your clown cars fall apart
can we apreciate how big the nurburgring is? At that speed and corners will still doable. In a normal sedan i think ull fall asleep
All I wanna know is what brand of tires are being used for this run?? A 5000lbs. car going around the Ring at these speeds without a tire failure is just a marvel of engineering. I can’t drive my car back and forth to work at 60mph without some fear of tire failure, and my car is almost half the weight of this whale!
steering wheel looks like a terrible idea...
All we know is he's not the Stig. He's the Stig's vegan cousin....
Tesla should sponsor hands-free driving races.
7:32 Giulia for 15k less money..better overall..
Sad!  It's a full 40 seconds slower than a Porsche 911 GT3.
Whenever I see a video by Tesla I like to imagine that Elon Musk uploaded the video himself
You can hear the suspension depressing that’s how quiet it is
It really is enlightening to see the top comments of many true car and racing enthusiasts, who aren't here to bicker about gas versus electric, but set aside their differences to unanimously agree that what's important is how this dude is a damn good driver.
That thing is a rocket-sled
Very impressive acceleration! Well driven!
That yoke looks so shit.
Fascinating silent speedster.  Thanks for sharing  👍
Still 10 sec slower than Panamera
Now that Lucid Air Sapphire is here, Elon at minimum needs to come up with a Nurburgring Package, and gets ome real breaks and tires on this thing.  This car is not set up for track work, at all.
Next time let it drive😂
Wow! Fastest golf cart in the world. Tires sound unhappy though.
Now THAT'S BRAVE considering Tesla's rep for their braking systems!!! 🤔😏      😎🇬🇧
Average speed of him is 164 km/h
A GT-R did this time 15 years ago when Tesla didn't even exist, can someone explain why people actually like this piece of shit?
That was a brave drive. Not really a track car. Well done.
If anyone’s wondering his top speed 269👍
Most peaceful driver in Ohio
Wow!
i love this ...really Thanks Tesla
"Model S Plaid sets an official full lap time of 7.35.579 at Nürburgring" ....then needs a full recharge, a new set of brakes, a new set of tyres, and last but not least, a new pair of underpants!! I'm guessing they call that Tesla "Boaty McBoatface" for a nickname. Kudos to the driver, screw that for a game of soldiers!
Its a crap car, look at the drivers stearing
Very impressive it didn’t fall apart!
Why no times...we want to compaire with times porshe 919...
that steering wheel is suicidal.
вообще не связи руля с колёсами😢 ужас😢😢😢
It seems to be a plane which can’t take off!
Not made fot race, sure!
Props to the passenger for holding filming so steadily.
That tesla will never be the same after that :)
pure acceleration - insane!
想看看3跑纽北克
One indicator of a car being shitty and no use on real roads is "tested on the Nürburgring". This thing has no stability at all. Look how the driver is fighting it....
Wonder if he was able to do more than 5 laps on the  🪫 battery
this steering wheel is a piece of crap
Imagine AI assisted racing. It learns the track after a few runs and performs a perfect lap. Elon, if you see this, do it. Give me credit tho ❤
Love the video but no stats? It would be nice to know what was actually going on?
Driver has them skills
Was it good? Such a bad video…
No engine sound makes this look boring as hell.
Looks like new born dear with rocket attached to back.
Wow…. Highest speed I saw on the speedo was 269 between 7:05 and 7:10.  That’s just crazy.   It’s a bit strange not hearing the engine which helps provides speed and acceleration cues.  I guess that’s why the tire sound is so pronounced.
I am sorry but I will never like battery cars... Its sooooooo god dam boring to drive and watch.... No fun at all. I take a combustion engine that is alot slower any day. This is like having a set of very... very nice speakers... but no way to get any sound signal to them. Then.. they are just simply boring.
Like a spaceship. Guys impressive.
Who was stupid enough to put a yoke in the car instead of a steering wheel? Yoke is designed for rotation of +/- 90 degrees. This is not good for a car.
its just not the same
I found myself leaning heavily into every corner, skating half way across the lounge as I passed the chequered flag! 🤣
Lucky the brakes didn't just stop working on you like the handful of people it's happening to on the ring.
Lahm für ein 1000PS-Auto
A u turn at 100mph is fucking insane. My fiat panda is crying at 30mph U-turns
What a POS
Clever editing. The brakes didn't overheat once !
Video is a load of crap the Plaids sold to customers do not have the braking setup that was on this car i don't care what they say😂. A normal driver can fry the brakes on a plaid never mind this guy lol.
WAIT THIS IS NOT LIKE ASSETTO CORSA THEY ARE LIYING TO US
🥱 No thanks.
I'd be terrified to take a car with the build quality of a tesla that fast around a track.
Would of been impressive if done this on autopilot, at this speed
Great lap time. The Lexus LFA did the Ring around 7:14 a couple of years ago.
now that I think of it, an electric car will not wear as much as a normal car when taking it to a track, just the tyres i guess
Taycan Turbo S beat this thing around the Ring while weighing 400 lbs more and with 400 hp less.  The difference between a company producing an all-around well built sports car and a company building a one trick pony that can win drag races on youtube for the clicks and publicity.
Did you forgot to turn on the microphone??
Looks so shaky
that sounds depressing
does the autopilot have a racetrack option?
1 lap AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
I've never heard so much tire noise from a Nürburgring lap.  I bet those tires were toast after just one lap.
yet a RS3 with less than half of the horsepower beat this thing... lmfao .... that just shows u that weight is the most important thing in setting a good time.
INCREDIBILE POTENZA !!!
thing handles like a school bus...
3:35 bug hit the window so hard it made a thump
If you get an oversteer with the square steering wheel, you're done. This is stupid
the accelration is like F1 car 😮
ludicrous speed
😂
Drives like a brick
Wow, I watched this more than 10 times. It released my stress so well. Thank you @Tesla <3
feels like playing video games on mute
Boring as taking a shit
Magnifique ❤
Dieser ganz Elektroscheiss dürfte nirgends zugelassen werden. Es gibt nichts Umweltschädlicheres als diese nutzlosen Elektrokarren. Dass die von Tesla auch noch besonders schlecht verarbeitet sind und schon nach nur 3 Jahren erhebliche Mängel aufweisen krönt das Ganze nur noch!
This has to be the worst steering wheel design ever!
charge use in one lap?
Das Ding ist mir zu Plaid
To heavy for a ringcar :/
wow, just a second less than my best time at the Nurburgring, very impressive.
It needs downforce
This video is meaningless and gets a giant ZERO for being the high tech ride with ZERO telemetry included in video for proper comparison to say a GT2RS driven in anger... BORING
どうせなら自動運転で攻めてみたら
Wish was in mph so I didn’t have to Google how fast this was!  😂  It seems like would be easy as F to crash going 170mph with no engine sound would mess me up.  You know you’re going fast when your engine’s screaming.  I had a V12 Ferrari 550 Maranello and that thing you knew you were going 190mph in!  🏎️💨💨💨💨
KOTZ, was Emotionslos
Bag of stones is faster....
There is no Rain, wet conditions, no engine sound, it feels surreal, but still very fast this electric powered tesla
My God I don't know how the car moves do fast and agile with his huge balls
First Tesla which needs brakepads replacement in a few weeks 😂
poooooor front tires... a lot of understeer and unbalance...
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That looks utterly awful  to drive .
Its his huge balls of steel anchoring down the car to the ground
Not insane at all lol. Actually pretty trash, nice try Tesla.
so a 2009 gtr beat a brand new plaid ...
Good Lap that...
Nice when you buy a tablet and you get a free car with it
Woooooow how exciting and totally not the dullest nurburgring experience I've ever seen.
Lesson learnt: he should probably have gone before leaving the house.
brutal
how much is it to get a complete steering wheel?
the fuckijng wheel dude .... ugly af
this is awesome
Without any emotions 😭 Electric Cars dont make fun, so silent, no emotions, the only fun is the fast acceleration but i must hear an engine. 💪 I never will buy such electrical car. Need car with emotions 💪 Dodge Viper ACR ❤️
lol imagine driving a battery car :P:P :P
Finally see the real Tesla not the fucking Chinese shit.
When he texts “I’m home alone”:
It needs the option at 330 km/h
teslas weigh 4700lbs !!  They only go fast in straight lines
When you mute your headset while playing a racing game
Can't really forget that it weighs slightly over 2 tons
MORE DOWNFORCE
not very reassuring jiji
And what can it do on the 2nd and 3rd laps? Porsche Cayenne GT does the same time.
Design a new style. Your cars are boring, look like bars of soap and are everywhere now. Hire some creative people who will say no and fire the yes men. We need shape innovation.
Boring as fuck. Why don't you engineer a tyre that won't screech as much, that'll really suck the life out of it even more. Boooo.
めっちゃハンドルとられるやん ドライバーすごい
Eeehm. What was the time , and how does t compare ???
3 issues with the stock Plaid at a track- Suspension, brakes and tires. Cheapest mods and largest gains.
Damn it sounds and looks heavy as fk
Next, let's see how FSD handles the track...
The whirring sound of the electric motors is almost like a jet engine powering up. Very cool.
I don't understand how they got an approval for this steering wheel. I couldn't operate a car with this.
You can see some issues with handling by watching driver's steering input.  There is constant oscillation to keep the car steady.
Dude went through a brand new set of tyres in 7 and a half minutes... LOL!!
Those tires will echo in eternity.
What a heap of junk,  that stupid steering wheel,   no way would i ever buy a Tesla
Interestingly none of Tesla owners have even close skills to that. Why would need that power? And  handling was terrible, but thanks to good driver the car came back in one piece.
Those tires deserve a medal.
For reference, the Mercedes - AMG GT Black Series has a lap time of 6:43.62
Knowing how pathetic the car's brakes are, I surprised the car made it around in one piece.
So slower then a cayenne gt suv with half the power🤣🤣🤣🤣
I wonder how much battery this 1 lap costed, i doubt it could do 5 of them
The car sounds like it didn't like a single second of that lap
That sound of plastic xd
Now try it with the Stock Brakes... jkd its a nice video but im not kidding about the bad stock brakes fix that lol. Im hoping there will be soon competition for tesla (as they embrace and ask for that)
Impressive. That’s a range of round about 50km. And then welcome at the supercharger 😅
Nice sound!
I would f-ing hate that stupid steering "yolk" when driving like this.
You can see from the video it drives nothing like a real sports car. It's not about speed or power on paper, it's about how it feels and how balanced it is.
A little less than 3 minutes faster than a Ford Transit, nice :)
the yoke like a pos
horrrror movie
When I see that ugly steering wheel...
i can imagine all the beeping and carrying on the tesla computer would be doing if it wernt turned off
the acceleration it amazing 😻
da gehört sound hin kein elektro scheiße
looks booring as fuck. save the sticks
Well the cost of tires will negate the EV plus. Also, wait time for charge = money lost. Porsche is still the standard.
Und wieviel Runden schafft der Elektroschrott ohne Sound und Emotion mit nicht gerade beeindruckender Straßenlage aber dafür beeindruckendem Fahrer👍🏻 so, bevor sich Akku und der Rest in Rauch auflösen? 3, 5 vielleicht sogar 10 Runden?
That terrible yoke wheel is definitely a disservice, with those turning ratios, the driver wouldve had an easier time and better seating position with a standard wheel.
Holy shit thats a lot of understeer.
amazing
Its even more fun in a Tesla because every time you arrive at a corner you don't know if the brakes are going to work.
It almost looks hard to control and the brake pedal looks like it's hitting the ground🤣. However loving the night rider feel
why not remove half the battery or even more, that's just enough for one lap?
If I'm correct, it starts with a SOC of 94% and a temperature (motor or battery?) of 21°C. At the end of the round he still has a SOC of 57% and a temperature of 66°C. So in one round minus 37% SOC. So he would have managed a second round. That would have been really interesting, regarding the temperature and how far the performance drops? But, respect for this performance. Chapeau Tesla ... and driver :)   *****   Wenn ich das richtig sehe, geht's mit SOC 94% und Temperatur (Motor oder Batterie?) 21°C los. Am Ende der Runde hat er noch SOC 57% und Temperatur 66°C. Also in einer Runde minus 37% SOC. Eine zweite Runde hätte er also auch noch geschafft. Die wäre wirklich mal interessant gewesen, bzgl. der Temperatur und wie weit die Performance einbricht? Aber trotzdem, Hochachtung vor dieser Performance. Chapeau Tesla ... und Fahrer :)
wow, the car sounds like the Titanic going down.
Time ?
That's painful to watch - this car works only in straight line.
I don't know, it doesn't look like it likes to be there and pushed around corners.
7:05 Top speed
I'm impressed the tires made it all the way around.
That is the emptiest I have ever seen the Nordschleife... the Plaid blew them all away 😂
That seems terrifying. There's no gear changes and engine noises that you normally use to gauge speed and braking. That steering wheel would be extra weird too! Props to the driver!
Btw m3 touring was faster with half the power
The car doesn't seem to be easy to drive like other supercars, it's just plain power. Not sure if that's a good thing or not
The luck that it takes to drive like this without the tesla bursting into flames., is mind blowing!
we want to see the (yet to come) Roadster soon please!   Should have at elast same high performance standards as latest RIMAC
The Tesla didn't miss one moment of understeer, it was on every single corner. So is economical then, runs on electricity and only needs a new set of tyres every 28 kilometres! Great car in a straight line, really fast, but if it means turning a corner you need  a professional race driver to drive you and own a tyre factory.
I dare say this car is moving at near F1 car speeds...
So the deceptive the daily driver interior vs the insane speeds seen through windows
The mighty dodge Viper made1 lap only and went 7.01
1:16 that looked scary
I would never drive the Nürburgring with the bad brakes.
Fried brakes
Slower than a RSQ8 with 2.5T and 600 V8 HP 😂
Look at that handling lol...
Kena hack kah
It simple physics. The car is great but trying to wrestle the weight of a model s is like a dwarf wrestling a bear. You eventually get ragdolled.
moin ihr Lieben -  wer hat Interesse einen  “plaid-owners-club” zwecks Erfahrungsaustausch / Unterstützung etc. zu gründen? 🖖🍀
Why would yous post this lads. Its embarrassing for yous
Simply beautiful...
Im a huge fan or super cars… my dad has a C7 Z06 which is fun tk rip and I want to get my own one day or possibly a C8 Z06, Lambo etc all the cars we dream of as car enthusiasts but I think the first big car I’d want to buy would be a Plaid 😂
Solid run. Surprised it took you until 2021 to upload this video. Now do the same with the Roadster. Hope it's faster, lol.
Looks like the Tesla speedometer is very inaccurate as they have to add a GPS speedometer
i respect the car and run...   but so boring i can not watch...  i have a ZL1 1LE... manual trans.. .

elon car vs burger ring
Modulation frequency sounds nice from low RPM on full throttle.
Wait so my Renault Megane RS is nearly as fast around the ring...crazy
that stering wheel  got go
Maybe there would be less understeering with slicks --> less noise from the tires
Awesome drag race car, horrible sports car
Waiting for the day to see Tesla in Motorsports competing against manufacturers.
An Audi RS3 did that same time with only 384 hp! Now why is that?  The AMG 1 has similar hp to the Plaid, and does a 6:35. How bout them apples? "The Plaid is Sad"
The time is impressive, but in a fairly straight track like the ring, it's not surprising when it has 1000 hp. People forget that except for hypercars and gt cars, the time most relies on drag racing the straight parts the most for cars. Raw handling still doesn't matter too much in the ring.
PLEASE GIVE BACK Amatsuki CHANNEL!!!!Please gentleman !Apologize !!!
This man’s balls weigh so much, he could take a minute off the lap time if he’d cut them off.
I just find it funny that some dud on an old suzuki gxxer beat this
07:45 nice
The driver impressed me more then the car
It’s unreal how a relatively inexpensive family sedan can achieve one of the fastest lap times on this track. The only cars that beat are cars that cost 4x as much and were designed to go fast around the track.
is this the record for fastest time? i cant imagine anything beating thiss.
O my God, that's not a car that's a monster
batt lasts for one full lap?
handles like a boat
Nuerburgring in.my blood,....born and raised  ♥️ 💜 💙
It looks and sounds like he's boosting when he hits the accelerator.
🖖🏻
He most definitely knows how to flatten a curve, because those 5500 lbs could not handle one 180. Its linear speed is insane. Still doesn't look fun, and your average Virginia driver would run it through the local house trying to do this.
You can't argue with it in a straight line. Absolutely spectacular acceleration, but hauling that 5000lb ass around corners isn't easy.
7.36 💪💪💪💪💪
10000\0
She needs an exorcist every time she corners.
And to think how many kids are mining the cobalt in the Congo for these EV batteries. Shame on Tesla and the people that buy them. Tesla = slave owners.
naice
Not really impressive for a car with 1000hp. The Porsche SUV did the same time 7:38 and thats a SUV with half the power
I looked at the top lap times for the Nürburgring. This is not even close to the fastest... Then you're reminded, it's a also a somewhat practical family car....
It did not like the Carrousel one bit,lol!! Pretty impressive for a 5klb brick tho. Was fun to watch the skill of the driver. Razors edge!
Terrifying. Would not want to be in there while it's being driven like that. But impressive!
From the first corner this was terrifying, watching the guy trying to get this thing slowed down. Tesla needs to hire some performance people to get things handling better. This didn't look fun to drive at all. The power is INSANE, but the roadholding and brakes are not up to the same standard. This could be THE be all and end all of performance cars with a bit of work and fine tuning. That said though, it's been proven to do 213mph with the software 165mph speed limit removed, which could certainly shave 5 seconds off the straight. Not sure why Elon wont let the Plaid do 200mph yet, I imagine it would fry the batteries
The speedo is in mph... fucking hell
This just sounds all wrong
At least you can hear the tyres noises
where is all this brake fade ? :P
well that really doesnt look like a pleasant ride. actually looks and sounds scary as hell lol
Superbly driven! Well done!
I bet he wished for a different steering wheel
Needs better tires...
Nice to see a 2 ton family car zoom around the nurburgring in 7 and a half minutes
On a track that's mainly about straight line performance and this heavy piece of crap barely beats the lap time of a front wheel drive hot hatch 😅 Imagine how shit it would be around a circuit that puts more emphasis on handling and braking.  When your battery is flat after a couple of laps, what's the recharge time?
Dude, do they have all seasons on this thing?? The tires were audibly comparing about turning the whole timd
Battery before and after
So when you wanna buy one of these, please, buy Pirelli P Zero
“For a brick, he flew pretty good!”
Not good at all and for people saying it is fast wake up, it is only fast in a straight line, the Porsche Panamera Turbo S did a lap in just 7:25.04. That is more than 10 Seconds faster.
WOW 👍👍👍
Pretty unimpressive 7:35.  Great driving keeping it on the track tho
The concentration you need to have driving like that - I am exhausted just watching this
Can an AI drive better than this man? FSD 99.98 Beta ?
Man Tesla needs to improve their suspension. This car has the acceleration of a spaceship but handle's like a boat.
Completely different: All you can her for 7 a half minutes are aching tyres. And a big respect to the driver: it accelerates so fast, it must be really difficult not to miss the right point to brake hard enough not to fly out a narrow turn.
Tyres singing Mercy, Mercy, Mercy. And this 'Plaid' is obviously heavily modificated.
Am I the only one who thinks this steering wheel shape is just stupid AND dangerous?
1000hp, but same lap time as a BMW M3.   I guess this is the new American muscle car.
How were the brakes doing after that lap?
Voiture beaucoup trop lourde.
This stopped the climate change
Taycan turbo s managed to lap faster than this with 260 hp less and 150+ kg more lol
got your arse handed to DADDY PORSCHE
Katastrophe.!!! Kurvenscheitel völlig missachtet. das ist irgend n Ami der nicht fahren kann. Elon.. hier hättest Du wirklich mal in unseren Vettel investieren können. Der hätte Dir eine Zeit rausgeholt die Werbewirksam gewesen wäre
Somebody knows about best lap time ?
The amount of likes I get is the amount of times I would have crashed that car
This guy has to absolutely be related to Stig . That was a suicide mission gone pg13 .  Literally need forearm strength to handle the weight of this thing .  I like how he casually slid at 130km geez man with a double twisty .  God bless those tires especially of made in the uS !
Can we just thank the tires 🛞 for whatever was just done .  D@mn that sounds stringent
The tires have now left the chat 💬
Whats the trick for that thing to go over 300kmh ?
Plot twist : the speedometer is in miles per hour
The plaid got out classed by a car with 450 less hp and weighing 400 lbs heavier lmao what’s the excuses now clowns 🤡
That steering wheel is pathetic. Because yeah lets make a race car style wheel by cutting the top of a normal wheel off so the normal spot for your hand is nowhere to be found, thats not how that is done. The guy who designed that has never driven a car before thats for sure. Look at how he has to constantly adjust his grip because it can't be held normally, compare that with a regular wheel or a racing car style wheel, none of that adjustment would be needed, just a slight roll with the palm for corners thats all. What a stupid way to ruin a cool car. I would genuinely not get this car based on that alone. And I didn't even mention everyday driving with parking and stuff, good luck with that...
Great that Porsche set a faster time with 300 less hp!
That’s like an insult to Nurburgring, driving a car with no engine sound 😁
I'm wearing a helmet while watching this

The most boring nurburgring lap you can find on the internet
Taycan turbo s managed to lap faster than this with 260 hp less and 150+ kg more lol
Sorry but what a idiot steering wheel design, looks a preparation of auto pilot ( steering wheelless design might be) , even looking how the driver struggle to manage the car, autorities should not allow homologation it for daily usage.
And it's not 100% Battery
Everything squeeks and rattles...and the steering wheel....blah! Taycan beats it with ease.
Si sente la plastica :(
imagine losing to a taycan with about a 300hp advantage
No engine noise, just tires.
ASMR
Ok 3 Rounds and the computer put it to 50%  🤣🤣
The power is just wrong 😂. Imagine electric cars in 20 yrs?  Scarey
star trek ?
https://youtu.be/qK5CxS966Cg
Tt
“Quiet”?…this beast sounds like a 💨🛩!!!
the worst experience ever its like driving a ELEVATOR  what a joke ev’s are LOL
Cool but I love this track just to listen to the gas engine running wide open.
Without the engine noise it Looks like a roller coaster without tracks, Behaves like one too.
Teslas should have a learning function, that enables the car to learn the drivers habits and mimic them in self driving mode.
See, this shows you Tesla  cars are not that intelligent, if they were, the car would say what the hell do you think you are doing, ok that’s it your driving privileges are revoked.
That yoke steering is the worst. That must take some getting used to. But god damnit this car can accelerate!
looks nice car that can beat every bike and car up to 155mph or the 1/4 mile
This looks too slow against Porsche 919 evo
une voiture absolument pas faite pour ce genre d’exercice un poids colossal, des suspensions et un chassis inadaptés au circuit, des pneus qui saturent et hurlent a la mort au moindre virage et je n’ose même pas imaginer la gueule des freins au bout d’un tour bref une voiture de grand tourisme championne du 0 a 100 en ligne droite (on peut pas lui enlever ça) mais c’est tout. Respect au pilote neanmoins qui a l’air quand même de s’amuser avec ce gros tank
Check out Iron Nitride magnets they can revolutionize EVs they are stronger and cheaper than neodymium have no rare earth mining issues and no national security conflicts by sourcing from China. All you need is iron and ammonia for raw material
Definitely not the stock brakes ….
Looks impressive!
That steering wheel is dangerous for this car on a track.   If the driver had to counter steer more than 135degrees, he would be in trouble.   Even on some of these turns his lower hand was barely on the wheel.   A normal person trying to counter steer on the street would have no chance
id love to see an aerial view of whole car, superb.
Pilot good 👍
That steering wheel is sketch.   I would love to see two Pro drivers compete on this track Plaid and good old GTS R3.
I would've loved to see Sabine Shmitz have a run in the plaid around the Nurburgring, r.i.p to the legend
take the plaid put it in a rally spec chassis
This thing had to have been outfitted with special breaks and suspension as they are notoriously extremely weak in both areas.
is that speedometer reading in mph or kmh?
The tires are shreded.  Nice driving.
its a bad time for this money - and Tires are dead after this
guessing kmh instead of correct units?
Sorry. Needs an ICE to feel right. Golf cart anyone?
Some serious driving defo got a bit twitchy no doubt thanks to the weight but suorised at how well it managed to stay composed top effort driver 🙌🏽🙌🏽
How did they disable phantom braking software faults?
He is flying!
I would assume the tires are not standard equipment.  Also interesting how the stock speedometer and the unit mounted are always off by 5 to 10 kilometers.
Considering the weight of this car, the tyre company should use this in an advertising campaign.
This family car is quicker than a Bugatti in a straight line, that is insane.
Not bad, but there are many cars that have fast laps, which the Tesla would beat in a 1/4 mile straight race. Here a lap time comparison to put things in perspective: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wirE0C2RLAg
Video is playing  x1.2 of x1.5 fast speed.(dont get fooled) Not fast, as you can see speedo.. max out at 260km/h is nowhere near fast on that stretch. Bad Advertisement
This is fast
260km +,WTF,he got balls of steel.
Those poor tires.
This video would’ve been soooo much better if pepper pig was playing on that obscenely large screen instead of sat nav…..SAT NAV! you’re on an effing race track you numpty cheddar bell end! I’m really really very very annoyed about this oversight. AMATEURS!
Surprised he didn't cook the stock brakes. As many reviews have pointed out they are quite weak. If you get a Plaid please upgrade the brakes ASAP
it is very stable, you wouldn’t say it’s traveling around 260 km/h
Cheap plastic
After 1 lap, 14h reload 😁
All  we know is, he's called the Stig!
4700# weight + 900 ft-lbs --> Magnifico City Bus Style Handling with Fantastico Tire Life... 🚀🚀🚀
Get rid of the stupid steering yoke and get a real wheel.
Why is the cars interior so loud?
electric cars will soon be so fast that they should just fly
How boring with no engine sound. Gonna miss those combustion engines a lot once they´re all gone. But on the positive side, in this Tesla then as a bonus you have all the squeeking noise from the badly assembled plastic parts
Display: kmh oder/or mph? 🤔
wow it is a lot slower than I expected
W środku jak tani warburg
It’s like listening to a popular song…without the singer….🤔
The Tyres: "Am I a joke to you?"
MASSIVE UNDERSTEER
Jeezus, it's like watching a rental minivan at the track. That has got to be the worst handling sedan I have ever seen. I would hate to be the guy that changes the brakes and tires half way through the lap... now go get in line at the charging station, we will see you back here in 3 hours.
Driver constantly fighting the car for grip because it's a small elephant.  Straight line speed is like a space ship though
I changed my pants after watching this.
/snore.....
2:50 is so satisfying
What a thrill, for sure.
Do a hill climb on Mt. Washington
I love that spaceship whine and the warp speed feeling.
Sounds like my e-up!
That looks very stressful.
The driver is fighting to maintain control the entire lap. It does not look like a good handling car. I have seen many videos of drivers on Nurbergring where the car handles effortlessly compared to this. Stick to the 1/4 mile!
It handles like a 1976 Cadillac Eldorado, screeching tyres n all! Typical yank-tank, 2.3 tons.
Heavy ass lightening
Horrible steering wheel for such kind of driving
Tires are probably like banana peels after that ride.
Is the speedo in mph or kmh ??
Misha Charoudin is this you?
It's like driving in a dream
Doesn't seem to handle well. Strange that it does not show a stopwatch display. I doubt it did the run in 6' 40".
İs this car bone stock?
Not too bad but the  Porsche 911 GT2 RS  @ 6m43s almost a minute quicker :( But give it some upgrades and time and who know ???  Sure 3x price and in a straight line almost the same. But you know Ze Germans not gonna take this threat  lying down .... And if I'm not comparing apples to apples the heff-a-lump of an Audi SQ8 did it in 7:42.
Just love to hear the poor tesla interiør squeeks
Elon sure can drive
Why cant't tesla make real cars?
The crazy thing is that after this lap the driver changed the driving selector switch to Ludicrous Mode.
The absolute edge.  Driver attacking hard…great driving.  I heard the brakes on these things are pretty bad…I wonder if this is with the new ceramic brake option?
Great drag racer…. Track car, not.
Mola oír los derrapes más que el motor
No engine noise at that speed is just wrong, very very cool but wrong :)
Je voudrais bien connaître l avis du pilote......???? ..
sorry but the steering is just wrong, he won't be able to catch a slide... and correct it...facepalm
Машина агонь респект Илону
poor tires and brakes
driving it like f-zero
Yeah well listen to superfast Matt guys, and to the early Ferdinand Porsche … it’s all about WEIGHT and not accelerating and decelerating it all the time…
와 진짜 정신나간 한계주행...
Still sounds like a bumper car in the amusement park
This looks scary. Good thing the breaks work.
Imagine if it had brakes! Great effort and the acceleration is epic. Thanks for the content dude.
It is a huge RC car with controls built within.
Some goofball will think it’s in MPH.
Pretty awful time.  It's hard to corner a 5,000 pound battery 🤣
Feels so slow to watch because of the lack of engine noise, but the guy is absolutely sending it at 120-130km/h+ around corners and 180km/h+ through S bends in a heavy street car 😮 Incredible driving and the nerve to push it that hard with so many sketchy moments!
On 1st turn,  omg this thing is heavy and not sporty at all!
It kinda sounds like a jet engine
electric cars are boring
1. Amazing pro driver 2. Plaid is really fast 3. Teslas corner horribly 4. An average driver would died 100% trying to do this
Never felt so much for poor tires screaming they are dying under the weight...
That thing’s like a spaceship
taiwan ling zhi ying accdient  is Tesla model？？
Bro is the roadster even real?
Too heavy, crazy to take this ugly thing around bends fast.
As responsive as a boat
bro when he sends it, it sounds like a boost from a video game
wow its like driving a heavy bus LOL with super powers
Too bad it got absolutely wiped the floor with by a Porsche with over 300 less hp. Nearly 1 min lap difference.
Tamiya on greenhell...sounds like a KITT car during acceleration...
So interesting having just watched the BMW M4 CSL's record breaking run. This thing handles like a trash can in comparison which is a shame. It's got the speed, just poor agility and extremely dangerous brakes.
We dont hear the tires at the racing as much as here because these ones are not racing tires correct(i get the weight thing)? :)
Mann..This Car should be declared as a Jet..What the heck. Its my dream Car.
I’ve always wondered how fast a brick with decent brakes could go around the Nurburgring.
not bad, but still is "too fast" car, you know? out😅
All the dashboard creaking and flexing… 😬😬 sounds pretty cheap
Imagine if he had a better steering wheel .
that coal burner hit 165mph      impressive
impossible to park a car with that steering
What brakes did they put on this.
What a pilot😵
Can someone show me where this lap time is posted, I've not seen it in any of the ring lap time boards. As of 2022, all 10 fastest laps belong to production sports cars and and a Jaguar holds the 4 door saloon category. Fastest EV 4 door saloon?
Weird how off the two speedometers are. 🤔
Electric shit..💩🥴🥴🥴
But did it have production brakes?
Impressive! Though all the creaking from the chassis is pretty distracting, and proves how Tesla cannot built a quality product to save their life
The quietest lap
the most impressing part is the phone and the keycard didnt move at all!
268 km/h ? No eran 320 o algo cercano ?
imagine if it had stickier tires. he sent it tho, great driver!!
What happened to the sound?
This is as boring as it gets. It's like watching golf expecting a football game.
Three things: 1. It's easy to see how The Ring can kill you, if you don't know the track well. 2. Once those tires are really warm, driver REALLY pushes it. 3. Electric steering system on a 5,200lb. car seems frightening to me.
One thing to take away from this video is how far behind tyre technology is. I’m sure this car is equipped with high end performance tyres, and yet these tyres are fighting for their lives just trying to keep up with car. Imagine the full potential
100% the brakes and wheel setup are not stock.
That wheel is got to be the dumbest thing I've ever seen.
That thing is a TANK hahaha better stick to drag racing.
All the rattling and creaking says a lot about the awful build quality.
Slower than a BMW M3 Touring and no engine sound. ;-) Pretty boring, especially in the corners because of the weight. I guess electric cars are nothing for me...
Fast yes, but I'd much rather drive something with an engine....Fast isn't as fun without the Thunder to go with it.....  * Yawn *  Zzzzz
Без клетки, чо, так быстро не получицца?
12 seconds margin is not that impressive when you take in count that the porsche taycan has 260hp less than the plaid and the taycan is heavier too so it would be interesting if porsche do a taycan version as powerful as the tesla 😉
Self drive function is now familiar with the track... Who's up for a hot lap , sitting in the back seat ?
This looks so much scarier with a yoke. Imagine if he took a turn a little too fast.. he's lucky he has gloves.
No matter what, these cars can't avoid the physics of trying to get 5,000+ lbs total to handle. Yeah, it doesn't use gas, but the cost of brake pads and tires must be nuts.
I wouldn't feel safe with a steering wheel like that. It needs a regular steering wheel.
fat ass car
I wonder if they put on Michelin Cup 2 tires?
DAS ist ja FURCHTBAR !! Ein Gequietsche...keine Emotionen ....NICHTS ! So etwas wollen wir nicht !
Gosh that steering.....
sorry, this is no driving, its sliding.....what a hectic driver....
The squeezing of tires😤😤
That was a fast lap. What I'd love to see the Tesla drive system in a car like the Porsche Works 911 GT2 RS
Too squeeky :(
That’s a fucking driver
more impressive playing at 2x speed.
Very heavy car
I just love the fact that the key card did not budge from its place
And what's the damn point, you'll never drive like this in public
Tesla EV- crazy acceleration - garbage everything else
So, what's it like to not blink for 7m45s?  lol  Well done.  :)
how come I don't hear the exhaust... Kappa
man when you lose control of that car that steering wheel is going to be like trying to catch a propeller. I predict so many amateurs are going to perish in this car.
Limited to 268 km but a nice ride .
Lol and this is just a family sedan competing with 2 door tiny super cars
Still hate the steering wheel, no wait, steering thing
Does not look like a fun car to drive. No inspiring sound & feedback. Its the worlds fastest electric go cart imo.
fast in a straight line but doesn't appear to handle corners well,  and i'm not sold on that steering wheel.
I'm giving a dislike for having no important info about if the car is stock, I see the racing seat and who's the driver, feels like he just got the driver's license, or maybe I'm wrong, and he passed the DMV exam 2 days before the Ring drive.
Хорошо стоит видно легкая в управлении водила ок
What was the lap time?
One more lap and those tires will start acting as external combustion engine
What’s with all the creaking? 😂
I’d love to do this.
Fck gas!
3:11 honestly brutal acceleration
I would love to know if that car was on street tires...
I just watched the new BMW M4 CSL do this lap and from what I can tell, the driver looked like he had a much easier time. Both amazing cars in their own worlds.
Small v8 will make all the difference trust me
Boring
"Well then that was a good afternoon drive"
Good driver,trash car
where you found this stupid driver ?
US styled production vehicle- left hand drive still has phone charger, center screen, and rear view mirror with confirmed top speed at 216MPH, safe too assume the speed is MPH not KPH. Curious why he's in the brakes so much since the Tesla engine brakes pretty hard; would def. make it a learning curve (pun intended). The 'vette ran a 7.26, so this is not to shabby for a production at all
As a racer myself, I can't really imagine racing an EV, it's so odd not hearing the engine at all. Engine sound is quite important in my opinion, but well you can tell it's rather amateur pilot, he's afraid of that right side apex a lot, probably doesn't know the track from head or was told to take it easy .. either way this time could be shaved down by a lot I'd say. I'd love to be racecar tester, I'd push those times so low that nobody else would be able to beat them.
Sabine drove it 10: 08 by diesel transit.
Steering looks like rubber rods was installed.
OK, what's the 2nd labs time?
Looks like a real piece of shit compared to all the other cars of its speed, honestly.
Now set it too auto-repeat and you can fap the next lap!
Se te han olvidado los palos de golf, lo de digo por lo del carrito
по моему он нарушает все законы физики))
Most comments are about the tires, but what do we know about the brakes??  Other videos comment about how bad they are for this much torque.  Would they have upgraded them for this track run over stock brakes??
FOR SALE this superb car, one elderly lady owner, non smoker, mostly driven to church and back
Flagged for Car Pornography 👍
Что стало с тормозами после такого?? интересно....
Considering this is NOT a race car, it is amazing what Tesla and a good driver can do. Just wait for the new Roadster to come out... get this guy... or any good driver like him to take it for a few test runs, and then enjoy what might be the fastest laps ever done in this famous track. A Model S with a good driver can do miracles... a new Roadster with a new driver doesn’t need miracles... they probably become God... lol. Cheers
Cheap plastic
How much that drain the battery
Yawn, no engine sound no excitement
Seems the fastest lap time is 7:30:9 seconds.  That's really poor  time considering this beast has over 1,000 hp.  It's crazy that the Jaguar project 8 lap time was faster at 7:18:6 and this jaguar has about 600hp. Seems Tesla is just another American car, good for drag racing only.
It's a lightning bolt in a straight line but it can't corner for crap. If it wasn't so heavy and had better tires it'd get into the low 7 minute range easily.
🤟😑🤙
Wait, it can turn?
when the tesla nav console is finally not the main attraction haha
Well that was the most boring uninspired and uneventful run around the ring Ever witnessed. Pussy space ship racing brought to you by Electric cars and their drivers that all sit down to piss.
rocket challenge
Steering wheel is dissapoint
I want to see it crash and burn for 3 days
dont look like it feels like a track car
Muy buena vuelta 👌 buen coch , la pena es la fiabilidad de Tesla y el servicio post venta miserable, y sus precios descomunales......y sus 4680 que son 💩💩💩  sin esos inconvenientes comprarlo sería buena opción jajaja
This I satisfying.
Sick!
needs coilovers
😂😂😂😂 wtf
More suspension? Got it
Do patients with a Pacemaker for there heart problems of having cardiac arrest. Do they get discounts too buy a testla ??
Impressive for family sedan but good lord is there anything left of those tires at the end of the run ?
The acceleration is sick
That acceleration is insane
Credits to the driver! This looks like damn hard work and maximum risk 😨👍🏻
Understeers huh?
This Is pretty slow, i'm Not surprised
Thanks for the video!
This is just not right…
Why does the cabin sound like its about the fall apart?  It'd literarily cracking almost every turn, sketchy asf, driver has skill.
Amazing
1 lap of the circuit, a battery to recharge and 4 tyres to replace...
2019 ZR1 did 6:57, 2020 base Vette did 7:28 and the plaid is much faster in a straight line.   The plaid is  a fast car, but I hope you guys improve handing and braking.   This shows how poor the handling and especially braking are compared to the corvettes because in a straight  line it’s no contest.
As much as I hate ev's, especially the tesla, this is progress. It may be shit now, but it can't be good in 10 years if they don't try it now.
Impresionante 🤩
ISTHIS THE CAR ALL THE AWD CIVICS BE BEATING LOL
His safety score after: NO FSD FOR YOU.
Did it make it to the finish or did it have to stop and recharge? 😆
Great video and can we have a special thank you to the driver with the huge balls of steel.
Only two places to while away some time. Before the first concrete return station and on the road from the last one. The most beautiful ride I have ever seen on this circuit. Hats off.
The Tesla warp drive.
Reminds me of Danica Patrick the way his hands are constantly jerking the wheel left to right even on turns. Very rarely was there a constant arc chosen for a turn and often the grip was jerking yoke left to right unnecessarily on straightaways. I certainly couldn’t do better, but I would think someone out there could. Each twitch of the yoke and reversing corrections adds extra inches and feet to your travel distance.
Love this track
So, 268 km/h is max ?
Worst steering wheel ever for racing.
The way this thing just casually reaches 200+ kph😂😂
I wonder if they could make a best lap full self drive mode lmao
Even faster then my daily highway drive!  Impressive!  My routine does not have all of these turns and corners either.
Boring electric cars will kill car racing.
I don’t care how fast it is. Engine noise is part of the experience
and remember folks this is without track mode.
factory ps4 tires? dang...
And he did this with HALF a steering wheel! For the price of the car you would think you get a FULL CIRCLE to grab...
Incredible driving.👌🏾 The car tops out at 278 miles or km/h on the car’s odometer. Is that miles or kms?
Hilarious hearing the cheap interior creak and creak
Einfach nur grauenvoll diese Batteriekarre. Lahm wie eine Ente und Straßen lage eine Katastrophe!
тормоза говно,подвеска вата
Why isn’t it racing against other car? That was stupid
the speedometers had ranging numbers
Было бы интересно попробовать насколько подкупает момент электромотора. Красиво едет, но как то необычно.
If it doesn't take gas it shouldnt be on the race course. That thing is going to need a charge soon. lol
там где 911 едит 140 кмч в поворотах   это корыто  едит  75 . но прямики долбит нормально электричка .
and now you have to charge it 6 hours to run the course again.
Dont care, its a dildo on wheels.
Did you upgrade cooling and breaking? ALL pro driven Teslas cannot complete a full speed run due to battery overheat and brakes cooking into mush.
Because wasn't shure about any collateral victims, he asked for a run for his only car alone on track 😂😂 Over TWO TON sedan on track.. soon we will see some school busses or american Mac with trailer on Nürburgring 😂😂
I wanna use that steering wheel
Im pretty sure the Brakes are Plasma after that!
id sleep to this but its currently "i dont wanna sleep day" (which is every day)
You can clearly see that in a lot of straight he does not push as much as the car can because of the risk of overheating brakes (in that way he does not have the need to brake a lot to enter the following curve), a car with that kind of speed deserves carbon ceramic brakes and and big brakes pistons...
understeer is so bad tho
It really looks and sounds as if the car was NOT intended to be driven like this. Slightly demented, and definitely not 'in tune' with the road, no matter how quick
nice sim rig bro how much did it cost?
I'm not a Tesla fan but 165 mph and the way it handled the curves (even with the ugly steering wheel). Very impressive not to mention how much gas was burned. Oh, yea no fossil fuel was wasted in the making of this film. Remember this is a stock streetcar your wife takes to work. Hmmm...
Dopo un giro del genere puoi dire addio ad un intero pacco batterie che si surriscaldano oltre misura.
definitly see the weight of that car7
Boring AF.
이야.무슨 롤러코스트 타는 기분일듯
The steering wheel looks like a Mexican Borito 🤸‍♂️🙌🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
First thing I realized was the interior component squeaks ...
The stig driving an alien spaceship
Who is driving
Really gripping stuff.
Impressive
Everyone's talking about the tires holding to dear life, but nobody asked how the brakes are doing. Probably burning and screaming right like they went to hell.
Those cars weigh just about 5000LBS so no wonder why the tires are crying.
How does this guy keeps this tank on the road in such speeds? Hats off man.
how much battery did it use on that run?
Awesome drive !  It must disconcerting for the driver not to hear an engine revving...
400more horse power to only win by just shy of 7 secs (vs Taycan)? I meeeeaaannn every driver that has tracked the plaid complains that the brakes are terrible and need to be fixed since the brake fluid get brought to a boil
I can almost hear all the Honda Civic drivers crying as they get passed by a car that sounds quieter than a vacuum cleaner.
Und wie Sie hören,Sie hören nichts😂
How many laps can you drive in this mode?
So small this lcd,
V12 engin 😄😄😄😄
Круть !!!
Ce bruit ! C'est magique............... .... Mouaahahahah
Meh, Knight Rider is faster and more armored.
That "Knight Rider" steering wheel looks silly.
What a boring video
There’s no denying that the Model S Plaid is a fast car, but holy hell. Those tires sound tortured, and you can hear the body twisting through the corners!
Один я думал что он раз^ебется?
It's like Assetto Corsa with a broken sound file.
100 - 200 вообще класс пушка , шин не хватает
I love the sounds when it accelerates, like jet, when electric motors get full power. Wonderful!
This man takes it seriously
But is it stock?
this is an abomination to be put on this road. sad comuter pod is all it is.
Between 100km - 200km amazing fast. Woww
It is crashing every corners
Creaks, moans, NVH? Anyone at this company ever heard of that?
Joke car
Meanwhile: 2017 Viper with 640hp, naturally aspirated, manual transmission - 7:01 min
Looked heavy AF.
Daym I am no real reacing driver, but seeing the wheel without it's top part makes me sad for the driver. In the sim fighting 15Nm of torque in the wheel I cannot imagine to drive a whole lap with this Model S Plaid wheel :D
Considering a 2022 type r finished in 7:48 shows all those ponies don’t matter if it can’t turn
you can clearly see the driver is uncomfortable with the steering wheel
That steering wheel is not meant for track
Those are some amazing driving skills imo
It's like a rocket on roller skates.  A car for people who don't actually like cars.
The most boring power lap I've ever seen!!!
that car is made to drive forwards, not sidewards
It’s actually not that quick in context. Slower that a c6 corvette and a zl1 camaro. After all the Tesla fanboys raving about how quick this is, it’s a little disappointing
how come you didn't use the Autopilot mode?
My 75k (half the price) car is still faster 😊😊😊 (zl1 1le) was a good vid though
Tires feel good??
Laptime of 7:35........... BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 8 seconds quicker than a damn Civic. So much for "world's fastest car"
Looks a little boaty but damn can this thing pull out of a slow corner
The driver is a Plaid actor
It has no body roll that's a fact, but damn she doesn't want to turn on curves 😅
Ghey
I still dont want to drive a giant tablet.
That map was in Gran Turismo Sport
The car is incredibly heavy, there's no getting around that, still impressive though
shitty in cornering but fast in straight lines.
guys im looking for a porsche video in the nurburgring and the driver was overtaking everyone even if the lane is so small and he passes anywhere and anytime pls help
When you play the video game and turn off Engine SFX
Okay, now do 3 laps in a row :)
👍👍👍❤️🤩
this car is a piece of 💩
sounded like the car was breaking the entire time lol
hearing the tires the whole time is strange, lol Was that stock? or racing tires and brakes n what not
Yawn….
Those steering wheels are so dorky.
rubbish
fantástico
This is the most unenjoyable racing I've ever seen. Electric cars are gay.
I'm willing to bet it can only do one lap and needs a charge
That plastic sound...
Not liking the dash. It looks like a delivery van. Come on guys, it's ugly. What, you can afford the whole steering wheel?
Speedometer display in miles or kilometers ???????
Das Lenkrad ist doch wohl ein Witz!
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣..it's a joke...?
Doesn't look like it handles very well.....speed is insane tho.
Once they get those new wheels and software upgrade, this thing will go an extra 70mph on that straightaway....
Topography AMAZING!  Situational awareness speed and location at a glance. Thanks for sharing.
Ohhh my GOD that's soon boring
Love the twin tire charged V10
Impressive, but i don't like the new model S interior at all. Can't stand this hilarious half steering wheel.
the most boring ran ever seen, the car sounded like it's dying lol
How about those brake failures...
I wish Sabine Schmidt could try this. 😥
Damn that's some skills right there. Who's the driver? I'd probably say Sabine Schmitz. She knows that track better than most.
This was on stock brakes?
You can joke all you want but I think even someone with half a brain can tell Tesla cars a piece of epic Engineering.
Had to play this at half speed just so my eyes could keep up 😄
Battery with wheels 🤮
The rubber particulates in the the sir must be very high
Один я заметил что спидометр теслы на 10 км/ч показывает больше чем телеметрия🤔
Teslas have such disgustin interiors, they obviously go for lowest cost plus zero design and useless steerinfg 'wheel' in this one
Literally just pressing the accelerator and braking; no shifting at all.
Completely soleless. Boring. Uninsprired. This is your future.
I love how all the comments are about the skill driving. I can 100% guarantee you it takes a ton more skill to wrangle a viper around this course.
Que aburrimiento de vídeo, solo se escucha el ruido de las ruedas...
This is a scooter not a race car 😂😂😂
for a car with 1000hp and electric motor 7:35 is sad time
Самое скучное прохождение Нюрбургринга в истории
Штурвал для таких трасс идиален!
Speedo on miles or kilometres?
snails
Dunno if it's just me but while its obviously blazing fast in straights I feel it handling like a boat thru the screen.  Mainly it seems to slow down earlier into turns than other runs I've watched, and there seems to be so much micro adjustments on the wheel that didn't seem to reflect on how the car moved.
who tf is a driver I want to drink a beer with him :D
Driving an all-electric car is like watching porn with the sound muted or having sex with your ears plugged.
No one is talking about the brakes 🫤 these aren't stock brakes.
Hear those tires squeeling like a piggy!
what is those crunches?
1 second slower than a Williams out there
the steering wheel on this cаr is dogshit
Soulless.
The fact that nobody is talking about the creeks tells me that only Tesla fan boys have watched this video
fastest tram
whi is driving ?
What sort of tyres were fitted for this run?? Must have been P/OMFG ZR/WTF
That trash 🗑 is only good for straight line drag racing, it has no brakes neither agility on the corners..  Just impressive acceleration, that’s it.. 🤷🏻‍♂
Тормоза покинули чат
GT-R nismo did a 7:08 i'm guessing because the tires on this Tesla were breaking loose A LOT!!!! Great driving skill tho!
Good. Everything is done quietly. No vroom vroom or the silly popping noise of the exhaust. Only noise is the tyres.
Surprised it goes that fast with his humongous steel balls. 😳
no
It’s almost like the knight rider steering wheel
Was the speed limiter off?  It had trouble getting over 268 kph
so boring.. at least play some music
I pretty sure they can put a card or can in the spokes to make a noise.. lol..
What will happen if Tesla joins Formula E?
petrolheads must think they're deaf listening to this
Can we all just have a round of applause for the two heros of this film.  The driver with balls of steel driving a nearly 5000lb vehicle around the ring at its absolute limit and the guy who made those poor tires.
First time I have ever laughed out loud at a Nurburgring drive!  BRAVO 🏆🇬🇧❤️
Da para sentir o peso do carro, se a tecnologia de transformar etanol em energia elétrica ser eficiente e conseguir reduzir o peso do carro já que não será mais preciso as baterias, aí sim teremos um carro espetacular
is this in mph or kph, i cant tell
Great driving. Boring car. No soul
The most impressive thing here is the driver honestly. We get it... EVs are fast. Now just make them look nicer with decent build quality, Tesla.
Мне кажется, если всю эту мощность передать на самокат, то мы начнём летать по одному куда захотим 🤣
To bad the brakes failed on the next lap
This was the most boring run I’ve ever watched
Is it in MPH or KMPH?
Quick lap but it sounded like the car hated absolutely every second of it.
ev cars are so damn boring, jesus i dont care if it does 0-60 in 0.5 seconds, its just so damn boring, yawn
I love that squeeze sound of interior ^_^
You sure you're running the right tires?
Needs adjustable servo steering force. Driver was struggling to find the limit of grip in the front tyres. I know it is safer this way... Hide it in the furthest corner of the advanced tuning section.
fast but boring with no sound
Did the rubber band not break?
You can feel massive weigh of this car through the video.
Damn that wash machine fast
Well I don't trust it because the brakes and brake fluid are weak in general anyone that would take it to the track should upgrade the brakes and fluid to avoid a soft pedal feel
That map kinda useless on this rallyway.
Какая она вся скрепучая, сверчков треш
I’m going to miss the roar of a flat 6, V8 or V12 engine in the future
Yeah the biggest thing that makes it slow  in a circuit is the weight, get a McLaren senna on this
Either this car has no sound proofing or the tires are garbage
아 존나 불안하다. 아직 테슬라는 아니네
Too bad...No more battery ans brakes after 1 lap 🤭
It may be fast but not as stable in corners like a real sport car
All the squeaking and cracking sounds really tell how much stress is actually exerted on all of the frame, suspension and other parts! In ICE cars, you just dont hear it as much! Or its just teslas poor build quality 😜 (just joking)
This car looks very unstable on the track to me...
its so slow and garbage cause its not miat
Pretty sure this one has carbon ceramics
What tyres did it have on?
I have the impression that the Bugatti Chiron holds the road better anyway.
One word: boat
i dont understand why people in the comments keep mentioning the tires... tires of every car make those noises and go through the same abuse....u just don't hear it because of the engine sound, but in the tesla you can certainly hear that tire noise because there's no sound of the engine...
The motors accelerating sounds like the car is just getting more HP in halo or something.
El récord más soso de la historia
The driver probs can’t even change any settings about the car bc it’s all on the touch screen and he has gloves lol.
What kind of graphics settings do you have for this amazing Grand Turismo 7 gameplay
too heavy, the dynamic is not that good, not stable enough
BMW sucks👋
Yee Haaa!!!!!!!!!!   Let's do it again!!!!!!
Wow, the car handles so shitty
a rubbish at Nürburgring
I can tell by the video that this car is very unstable and nervous, A VW Golf is more stable at those speeds.
when she says her parents are gone for the weekend.
What was battery % on start of race and on the finish?
The speed is kmph or mph?
2017 civic with manual gearbox just 7 second slower, i think New civic with good tyres will smoke tesla (dont hate just sport))) and yes i am not Honda owner , i drive BMW and VW)
we can see many haters down here braggin' about the tesla , but they can't accept the fact that Teslas and other electric cars will be the only cars on the road in the near future .
1000 CV elettrica 4X4 e poi ha girato come la Giulia quadrifoglio?? . 🤣🤣🤡🤡🤡🤡
It’s didn’t go like 1000hp. It’s too heavy.  Checkmate electric scum
BMW M3 Touring Lap Time 7.35 Model S Plaid Lap Time 7.45  But m3 has 510hp and Plaid has 1033 hp lol
Вообще не рулится помойка
when to change tires?
Thats cool but there is no sound so?XD
Its fast, but boring and got no personality.
such a boat
Hmm good sound the the plastic inside of the Tesla shaking. literally can hear the quality /j
terrifying
Top speed only 269?
It's a torture to see him fighting the weight.
damn
7:00 - 7:10 is the speed capped at 270 or something that seems pretty bad for a "fast accelerating car" as you guys would call it.
Slow
Bug at 3:38 obliterated
Fantastic performance in a straight line. Dump truck handling in the curves, even with this excellent driver is a handful. I'll stick to a 911.
When the kids are in charge. There is a reason a wheel is round. It's not the enterprise captain kirk. Let the free market decide if your design is good by offering both steering options. My guess, nobody orders the 5 year old wet dream steering willingly.
B.O.R.I.N.G.
nice
This is what we call a full sender
타이어가 문제가 아니고 ㅎㅎ 서킷 타는 차량이 아님.. 직진용 밧데리차..
A fancy golf cart with an iPad..
Thought this was GT7 lmao
Am I alone who noticed a different number on the speedometers on the 7:06 ?  May be it’s a size of tires makes such difference?
fuuu, sound of wheels, fuuuu, sorry i think im to old to find that cool even with 2000 hp
Electric boat with no brakes
the way that the center of gravity is so low, makes the car soooo much easier to handle around the corner. looks like it doesn't need any kind of anti roll bar or something. so stable
Why did they put a additional speedo there?
What is that track made of? Parking structure road? 😂😂
this is about the least fun lap i've seen around the ring ever.
no body roll..
Warum gibt es nicht in Deutschland das Auto zu kaufen ich verstehe es nicht
This speed is in mph or in kmph
All this power yet the M3 estate is faster
when u turn off engine sound in nfsu 2
I can't get excited without the engine screaming, not the same feeling
How did they complete this lap without overheating the brakes? I wonder if he took it easy on the brakes and still got an amazing lap time? Maybe it would be even faster with better brakes? And what an amazing driving job with the lack of a full steering wheel
Weight saving on this car is ridiculous... i mean look what they did to that poor steering wheel. That's no longer a steering wheel, that's a steering rectangle.
Whats up with the aero and the roll cage
It's impressive, but it's not pretty.
This isn’t fast at all. Now this is fast:  Porsche 919 EVO Hybrid - https://youtu.be/PQmSUHhP3ug  Hear that EV boost?
This pilot does not know how to hold the wheel and should not shake it back and forth like he's Parkinson. Or is it a (bad) characteristic of the Tesla steering system ?
Wer ist mit dem Autos gefahren?
Lots of understeer still great timing. Imagine a proper track tool by telsa.
낮게 비행하는 모습 잘 보고갑니다
that’s sub 7 …https://youtu.be/TdI6JCQkS0g
Thuiiiiiiiiiiiiii……
This thing will dominate Nurburgring.
Plaid in French means blanket lol
Unlimited of torque kill the show
So he's clearly a pro and knows what he's doing but why is he turning the wheel aggressively in small increments like a learner driver 🤔 😂   I thought he would be much more smooth, can anyone explain?
no grip at all
Funny how the navigation operates as if nothing extraordinary is happening.
타이어와 브레이크가 필요해
Tesla ditch the weird wheel get a standard round ontop and flat bottom seriously don't like it a bit wild in fast corners
Is this the end of combustion engine?
Я надеюсь скорость на приборной панели указывает в км/ч?! 😨
Dude's balls weigh more than the car... Sheesh
Everyone is talking about the tires. I bet the brakes are also suffering.
Heheheheh, that nosie from inside just like my Seat Leon 2004😂 every creaks
Aucun bruit 🤣
Stock tesla
this was near-death experience
Acceleration is sick.
Real Scalextric.....
cool but can't Tune a tesla boring!
Kernschrott
Adrenaline rush!!!
I N S A N E as F C K!!!!
Se oye como un carro que se te apagó en una bajada.
My model s goes through rear tires so fast
what is creaking? when he takes the curve
🐳
the acceleration is insane, as well as the rowing on stering wheel to keep that 2tons ship on the track
annoying squeak during acceleration😒
stub of steering wheel looks dangerous for expluatation
What about just letting the autopilot thing drive on this track?
I need to admit that sounds satisfying 😌
If only I could afford one. The acceleration is profound.  It sounds like an airplane taking off. Whatever tire manufacturer was used for this definitely deserves a plug. 5000 pound car those tires were working!
Beautiful v12 sound
It’s fastest time in the world?
Definitely could of got a faster time I saw many mistakes😎
269👍🏻
“Bono…”
Now I understand why future cars have no tires… we didn’t give up on tires… it’s the tires give up on us by give so much stress to them lol
Should have had some kind of meme playing on the dash lol
eazy 7:29, sub 7:30. kinda crazy, put it in la mans and see how far and fast it can go in 24hrs, interesting to compare charge time and full send to normal la mans classes. come on elon, i know u wanna see a tesla win la mans
That's pretty damn fast.  But the handling looks ass on it.
tesla fans are so cringe and really show that they know nothing about cars whenever they open their mouths... its hard to deal with tbh
скиньте это булкину
slowest 1000bhp car ever. bruh even panamera and cayene is faster around that track
Accelerazione folle per una frenata di merda.
💩💩
Quiet cars >>> noisy cars
this track like a map from shift 2 unleashed 😁
я который играю на этой трассе на своём кокпите в Asseto Corsa  :НЕ СПЕШИ! тут крутить будет!😃😂
E
Its so effortless, I would scream all the way through and pissed my pants
Limited to 268 km/h?
trust me this is the best invention made from tesla for sure
pov: you get a call from you mom that your dad has finally returned home with the milk
Абалдеть салон скрипит как у меня в Вольво 2008 года....
#ملتقى_الفاو_الاقتصادي
Those poor tyres 🛞
I am very ok with the fact that i'll only ever experience this in a video game
Is that car going upwards of 220mph?
кто после булкина?)
the noise when he goes full throttle sounds like spaceship lmao
Nice driving Elon!
RIP tires, the true about this is that the driver is insane! He takes perfectly the curves
holy shit
on ice
cow
Tires squealing even with the extra weight of his huge balls, yeap he’s sending it good.
Can feel the weight through the screen.
ทำรถแข่ง สบายเลย แบบนี้
Most uneventful fast lap
what a shitty car to drive
The breaking system is piece of crap
Autopilot in 2050:
#тесланамбаван
I wish I could of saw how much battery he used lol
The difference in this car is the horses want to work so they don't scream
o piloto é muito bom mas o carro parece estar muito escorregadio...
😎
If only that care had better tires and bigger brakes, it would have easily shaved off 10-15 secs. Easily!!!! I was literally cringing here watching it struggle for traction and breaks squealing non stop
Where is 7.15 Elon promised 🤔
basically ASMR
this car engine makes the same sound of mine, when I'm out of fuel.
This V8 sound😍
How’s the battery feels? 😉
Remac has the record now yo
Those poor brakes and tires trying to keep this thing on the track. It's funny how slow it is when it gets to a corner, but once it gets to the straights it just flies.
it does 100 to 150 like my car does 100 to 101.
it sounds like a rollercoaster
едет и трещит пластик весь заезд при малейшей нагрузке😂
Will be really interesting to see how the new, lighter, and faster Tesla Roadster does on this track.
this is just not right without engine sound...
Gas prices can suck it. Thank you to Tesla for giving people an amazing option to stick to the energy companies who've been screwing us for ages.
Put some slicks on it <3
the quality of the plastics are insaneee
Slow
Introducing, the all electric 30 psi naturally aspirated tire engine v12.
the pilot must be so stressed
This is the most boring lap around the track I’ve ever seen.
You should let Sebastien Loeb get his hands on one of these. He would make another record for sure.
This guy need jet engine car ..he drove like toys
i love that he has a fucking mini map lmao
Steering yoke feels looks like formula one steering.
And Elon realized the difference between race cars and american consumer cars
so slow for that kind of performance level
All that power with bad brakes and mediocre suspension can get you killed on a track.
Tires: Please, I have a family
I wish my microwave can cook food  as fast as this Tesla cooking the track.
Я бы лучше проехал!)
How did the brakes perform?
I love how much interior plastic noise there is I don't think a German car would sound like that lol
That guy can drive. It looks like the car handles predictably and balanced though.
wow
Might have to retyre that car.
This is sped up
Considering the output of this car, no gear changes etc this not an overly flattering time compared to it's petrol counterparts that have half the power or less, engineering is a beautiful thing. Tesla need to focus on everything else and not just more power constantly, i honestly believe a stripped out tesla model s with just 2 motors could give the plaid a run for it's money
Lmao fuckin’ battery powered junk
Fast on a straight line but very hard to handle on corners due to the high weight of the car
😱
The video is calming, but the comment is definitely chaos
Lol the tires fighting for dear life.
I wonder how fast the time would be if you sent it down that track without a driver.
That was fast but did not felt safe 🥶😂
Look how quiet this
Is that car stock? I think not stock
That's very slow for a 1020 HP car just 5 sec faster than a Renault Megane...
Even a Tesla can go faster and has a high survival rate than mazepin oh I mean mazespin
That Steeringwheel
bug splatting on windshield 3:35
KM or MPH?
Do a race with the model S3XY at Nuremberg tomorrow afternoon and the race should have the cyber truck, roadster, semi also start the race at 13:50 i will fly a plane to my home country se you tomorrow!
What time???
so cool stable car. Vary nice
Oh yes, and in 2022 a new electric luxury saloon with a Cessna tiller will do the Nordschleife in 7:35.....
These electric motor sounds are great to fall asleep to! Completely hypnotizing.
The same Sound like a train or electro 🚌.
You’ve ruined your safety score m8
audi rs3 did better (so basically pumped up golf), lol.
♈好強🤣🤣🤣👍👍👍
I LOVE the sound of the electric motors. Sounds like a spaceship
Scary as hell. I thought he was going to take off and find himself in another galaxy.
Finally a car worth every penny.
Pretty cool how the Tesla car lets the driver think that he is the one driving.
How many rounds until the car trottles the power down and the breaks and suspensions are dead.
I like the fact that they have a minimap
Omg is that a Tesla plaid sheeesh
Plaid 3 times reaches and tops out at around 260km/h - hard to believe but that track record holding Porsche (ICE) race car reached up to 360km/h on that track on that final stretch!
great drive
Man gt 7 looks lit af
The reason he only did 1 lap was because he had to change tires.
Veo q es normal que la cabina rechine odio eso
How much battery does it consume on a lap like this ?
The weight of the plaid is not from the batteries. It's from this drivers tungsten balls.
Love the car I wish it had a natural mean sound though…I wouldn’t buy something that fast to sound like a dog whistle
That car handles like a city bus...
Stock Brakes?
It's literally a fucking spaceship.
faster than a lambo?
cool rc car
I think that’s my sister driving. She totaled 6 cars before she turned 19.
Its got to be a record run or so close to it.
The difference between watching this and a Porsche 911 lap the ring is crazy. This is not a graceful, fine-tuned car. It is a 6,000 pound brick with more than 1,000 horsepower and zero handling characteristics. Watching it fling its fat booty around the track so inelegantly, oversteer and everything, and yet so fast like that is insane and scary at the same time. This driver's got balls.
thia guy knows what he is doing
Some nice driving and a nice car as well.
so satisfying to watch
I really like that acceleration sound :) And also the tires.
Shxt feels like the front tires got no grip at all …
Leinkrad ist ein 🤢🤏💩💩💩💩
This was wack as hell….
Now, let's do it again in full autonomous driving mode.
With that much tech and performance tire technology will have to try to keep up.
Should be more bugs on windshield. Signal of impending total ecological collapse.
Tesla can you get the AI to drive Nuremberg at full speed to compare lap times?
while Tesla is busy proving in Nurburgring its competition are still busy charting their own EV strategy
Bet you the person driving the car runs on batteries also.
Двигатель не слышно) Скрипы одни в салоне) Так и сума сойти можно
A cool display of how insane the acceleration speed is, but oh boy, it sucks at everything else lmao.
Those poor tires never did nuthin' to nobody.
What percent of a fully charged battery did this consume ? 😂
this car is very unstable! Very heavy!
This guy can't drive worth a $hit
I always thought Gran Turismo was exaggerating the tire screech
Oh damn, 7:28 was so close to the barrier.
Such a horrible car Can only do 1 thing Go very fast in a perfectly straight line Bad tires,brakes, suspension and poor quality build And still costs a hell lot
Spectacular video.. minute 5:24... who makes the farts??? Will be the horns of the batteries 🤣
Dumbass steering wheel, sweet car
Those poor tires.
Ok steering wheel yoke thing is super stupid
How does this compare to other cars same time anyone ?
The fact I know this track like the back of my hand, and I never driven it except in Gran Turismo. baffles me.
Huge Tesla fan but that is a slow time by performance car standards. Barely beats a 2014 Camaro Z28 yet the Tesla has about 500hp more. Apparently the battery weight is hurting the lap time more than the additional horsepower is helping.
I really dislike that steering wheel...
That’s not fair…! They practice in PlayStation first.
It sound like the Metro in Mexico City. I was always impressed as a child of the acceleration.
It can fart too 05:23
It's a big, plump, luxury sedan, ffs.
i would like to know how much battery was used for the lap. i would say at least 50%  edit: also, how was the civic type R only 10 seconds slower?
this is the scairest thing i've ever seen
What is the ratio on this rack… those corrections my god. Terrifying.
Es ist ein Rakete
This thing handles like shit oh my god.
AWD, twice the price, torque and horsepower of my Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio; but still 3 seconds slower. Awesome watch though.
very slow for a 1000hp car
Такое ощущение что у него люфт полметра.. Паралитик в гоночном костюме. Зачем так рывками рулить, колеса же постоянно теряют контакт и раньше срываются. Или ему просто нравиться больше слушать визг колес, больше то слушать нечего)
Not  often you can see acceleration. It's like a Playstation Game with the cheat codes on.
imagine spending like 500k on the latest gas powered hyper car just to see some quiet car that looks like a camry gap you like nothing
future car sounds
I can't believe a four-door sedan is able to do this.
I'm curious, what was your regen setting?  LOL if your drive mode was "chill". Nice vid.
The battery is criying
1020 cv (esattamente  il doppio della giulia qv 510 cv ) per girare 3 secondi  più lenta.  Elon Musk crede talmente tanto nell'elettrico che per i suoi spostamenti utilizza il combustibile fossile (non è mica fesso come i suoi clienti) utilizzando un bel Gulfstream G650ER.
a porsche panamera is faster
Bugatti's acceleration，Golf's conner speed！😌
7'37''
320 km/h?
The on board AI is going "Woaw".
Swap out the stupid lookin yoke for a normal steering wheel and replace the brakes to carbon ceramic and ur all good for track day.
this GTA7 footage looks so real :-)
That’s a heavy girl
Ahhh a good sound engine tires the fastest engine in the world  and it name is eeerrr
Great ride. Congrats
And now watch a V8 on Nürburgring
I'd wanna wear a helmet when doing that too.
OMG It handles like shit
Tires go errrr
Heavy!😄 But still looks like a lot of fun.
I KNEW that Tesla Model S Plaids are good for racing
OK .... @ $735.58 am buying and investing in TSLA shares !!!!
What happened to the other half of the steering wheel
00:55 - that's where I would have died.  This video is so intense, I can't even finish it.  Excellent job. Edit - the fact that this lap time isn't even in the top 100 is just........ (O_o)
はえぇぇぇ
Tesla needs a V8 Ferrari...
that has to be the most boring round ever done at nordschleife
schieben, quietschen und schmieren. ein sumoringer beim versuch sportlich zu wirken. boa nee.
Absolutely shit car.
after that he have still 52% of batery WOW that car was amazing
that seemed like a lap time of 7:35.579
thats a lotta rattles from a 100k+ car
I thought the video was on mute with how quiet it was, then i realized that it was a tesla
Ken Miles would have had some fun with this thing
This test shows perfectly that 0-60mph means shit if it’s coming to a real race
It creaks like an old ship
Nahhhh, no sound takes away half the fun😂
He was definitely holding back on acceleration during that long straight
Speed is not MPH ITS KM
1:20 That was terrifying
The interior sounds cheap. The tires and magnets sound better
This steering wheel is crap
that is in kmph or mph
Seriously.. it's like a rocket ship haha
suspension and tyres are so crappy, i wouldnt even try to achieve a time near to good. that driver has some balls
Hats down to the driver, but as a Taycan owner for almost 2 years now I've never heard sounds like these in my car. Such a poor build... 😅
Nice skills. You can feel the weight of the car just by watching..
which speedo is the lying speedo lol
What a tesla on race
Set the Tesla to full Auto pilot mode around the race track and then I’ll be impressed 😅😁😁
Impressive.
Very interesting how you hear lots of the sounds that are normally masked by revving
imagine how much better this would drive with a normal steering wheel
That driver missed every single gear change!! heheh
straight out of blade runner 2049 the hover car of dystopia futura
레이싱만을 위해 설계된 자동차보단 많이 부족해보이지만 벌써 이정도의 차를 만들어낸게 놀랍네 ㄷㄷ.. 근데 운전할때 핸들 안불편하나? 카와우에서 엄청 까던데 ㅋㅋ
Tesla is the best ❤️❤️💪
Not bad, but possible better. Strong car, but it's possible to handle this as well. I saw some fear in the driving, with more car specific practice, better concentration and presence, the lap time can be maximize.
Yes ….. this is fast but Mercedes-Amg gt63s is much faster then that car at Nurburgring
Tyres squealing on a gentle curve😂
and then the batteries gone lol
Handles like a boat but accelerates like a super car
mush to Heavy no Sound Boring....
Maybe better tires?
Porqué lleva traje de piloto ( indumentaria ignífuga) si el coche no tiene gasolina, es eléctrico?
That wheel looks dangerous af for daily use
The car seems to really struggle to getting past 270km/h on a straight line considering it's claimed top speed is 322km/h.
If you go slower it’ll be easier to control
Would have liked to have seen the Queen of the Nurburgring do a run in the Tesla. RIP.
As incredible as this is, I feel so sorry for the tyres, hauling 4 tons round corners at 150+ mph is insane
NFS Tesla add on trailer.
Better breaks and less mass. Imagine that for 1 lap.
You hear all the creaks and groans of the body of this car? Cheaply put together. Quality control has got to be brought up.
Tesla is the only car which will show you the sad truth of tires.
You can hear the crappy interior almost breaking 🤣
If you put at 1.25 speed it looks completely unread 😯
😪
LOL 6:50 AMAZING!
terrible driver
are you using kph or mph?
It’s definitely got the acceleration. But A 20 year old Volvo can handle better than that car 😅😂.   Amazing driving skills though!!
Watch it in 2x. It will be like f1 racing.
Looks more like a rollercoaster ride to me 😀
Hellcat got a 7:25
from 80 out of the kurve almost in a instant 200 XD damn this feeling
Right on the limit. Superb lap.
Sounds like a spaceship
Those Tesla cars get broken after 5 years of use like if they were cellphones.
Love the technology, but without the sound of a roaring engine it feels soulless.
That sound
Wow! that smooth cornering with such high speed and corner exit acceleration is so out of this world and its a family sedan. Damn.
this acceleraion 1:27
That looks like a 7:36ish, for a family car, with room for the dog. Looks like the ICE age is over
Is the windshield cracked due to extreme chassis flex ?
sounds like the ghost busters' turning on their plasma guns... lol
Thing going hard!? 💪
Nothing getting you a stiffy like hearing a vacuum spool up to 250km/h
His max speed?
So Audi RS3 vicinity…
let's hope it has usb c fast charge
AMG: hello there 4:27
Its scary doing high speed without engine noise.
Stupid steering wheel though.
This is amazing, amazing driving skills too! Love going around Nordshleife and try to do a trip every year!
Such a wonder that this junk didn't fall apart.
And when you try this "at home" the brake pads snap in half and you end up nearly killing yourself and wrecking your car as we see.
Harakiri
The editing of tire sounds are terrible, for a billion dollar company and they can't even sync the clipped sounds effects to the video... what a joke 🤣,  people are so dumb, they can't even tell its clearly edited sounds.  TESLA IS A MEME
Surprised it made it all the way round without running out of battery
I wasn’t in the car but was still dying 🥵
100К $ и скрипучие сиденья в подарок
is that kmh or mph?
This car sounds like most the cars from Gran Turismo 5 and 6 🤣🤣🤣
impressive drivers to test these machines
What was the time?????
Der Walther würde lachen und sagen Kinderspielzeug
I mean ..it goes ..but in a boring and lifeless way 😴
6:57 tesla clearly has something wrong with the speedometer. Or are they deliberately overstating the speed?
Part 2: Run the same stage on Autopilot set to max speed? Can't wait to see it 🚀🚗
Watching self driving cars on this same track will be interesting future
The comment section is full of professional drivers
Why are Tesla's so creaky
I’m surprised it wasn’t faster
That's arround the time of a 2006 Porsche 911 turbo
The ‘narrow’ tires aren’t designed for the track considering the cars weight disadvantages on twists and turns. Should switch the 265’s to ,at least, 305’s to 315’s.
For a brick, he flew pretty good!
Incredible driving skills...to my knowledge this car has no traction control unless was added to software for this run!
Why wasn't the radio on?
Great driving skill to deal with that heavy understeer and snap oversteer. That's a difficult car to drive fast on a track.
if not fot the tires screeching , nobody would believe those speed numbers ,,, zero acoustic feedback ,  whole car is silent !!
Beautiful driving. Makes for a great video. However i'd love to know what those 2 bars represent on the extra hud display. Im guessing the top one is brake temp, seeing how it reacts, no idea about the bottom tho.
Akku leer nach 3 Kurven. Nice
There's a lot of room for improvement.
That's pretty damn good, although there are plenty of sedans with 300-400HP less that do faster laps so really, nothing groundbreaking here.
the steering thing being speed dependant sensitivity has to be a mind fuck going into a corner, lock to lock in a quarter turn, doesn't seem like a lot of room to modulate pressure, especially when you're BOUNCING UP AND DOWN
was that mp/h?? If yes, fkn give me drugs so i can handle it.
how much battery did that use?
There really shoud be a fireplace on the console screen while this is done.
Running out of fuel in Assetto Corsa:
Seems driver or racer really scares to put this car to the limit, not so much control on high speed, stability, vibrations. Well it's not a racing car.
how practical is it to steer a car with 1/2 a steering wheel? This isn't F1 where you're just making 180 degree turns max.
Tesla engineers: How futuristic steering wheel you want? Elon Musk: Yes
2:07 Hello rebel tree!
I honestly don't have a clue how does he know how fast is he going, i mean by looking at it i feel like sound is the main indicator
I just wanna know if that is in miles or kilometers.
You can just tell this thing handles like a tank. Too heavy, loose and not much downforce. But hey, it will still entertain those who only 'race' in a straight line.
I'm shocked that he didn't crash it !
looks like his fastest speed was 269 kmh /  167 mph
BRAVOOO
This car handles like a fat cow. Poor driver. It's as tedious as watching a golf cart tumble down a mountain.
Pretty impressive how this thing made it around considering the car weighs nearly 5000lbs (2267kg), those tires were certainly putting in work.
This thing wants brakes 😂
IS THAT MPH? THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT?
babanın arabasımı la bu böyle kullanıyon :D . adam efso sürmüş ama be! :) helal vala ;)
nice rollercoaster. or a plane taking off
omg how heavy is this car?
Why is he driving so slow? I think my time in my 2012 prius was 2 seconds faster.
Nice being able to fast forward between the turns.
Need that 200+ mph down that long final straight , believe it only got 172mph ? That's where many seconds are made or lost ?
Holy hell that thing is fast.  I wonder how many middle aged men are going to end up ending their lives in a fiery ball of lithium?
@1:38 thought he was about to lose it
Meanwhile, I'm usually behind the owner that only drives 10 mph UNDER any given posted speed limit, because they're trying to preserve <1% battery drain...
I hate electric cars, but jeez this is FAST.
The most scary part is how this car trajectory is corrected by computation.
What was the auto pilot lap time?
Please give me a Plaid.🙏
Lap 2 = 10minutes
Accelerations sound like Ironman about to fire. 😁
1020 HP and top speed only 268 kmh?
smooth ride
I’ll never drive a road car with that poor attempt at a steering wheel. It’s a fail bigger than the lack of drivers display on the 3.
bought 5 more shares
He had Starbucks programmed in the nav. Interesting.
Feels lifeless
Poor performance for a vehicle that promises to be quick
Ok… it’s an amazing car as in Chiron amazing in a straight line.  But it can’t handle for shit.  People with the 4 door / heavy arguments.  RS6 / Amg / M5 can tho?? And top speed upgrade coming ( which should’ve come already seeing as that’s what people paid for) won’t make a difference except for a literally 2 or 3 straights.  And before u say I’m a hater , I just had twins so I’m selling my 911 turbo and me and my cousin have 2 on order
Impressive this car can handle the weight of this guy's balls
267.
What a bad-ass driver!
Power machine.
What's really interesting is seeing the difference between the real speed on the GPS dash and the apparent speed shown by the car itself. It's not showing the real speed, as it were. The in-car reading is inaccurate to begin with, which means at any given point it's about 5% above the real speed of the car. But when you're braking, it's actually a couple tenths BEHIND in updating the information. So for example, at 4:25 , the real speed of the car is 164 km/h. But the in-car dash is showing 177km/h. That's a pretty substantial difference, and an indication of a serious issue in the software.
The interior is beautiful  Very futuristic/modern
Getting mine i three months, summer is going to be amazing ❤️❤️❤️
all i can hear is knightrider music
*When you're late to work the third time in a row*
fastest 0-60 in the world and over 100k and only gets 7:35? pathetic
I love how he’s wearing fire resistant gear in a electric vehicle that contains no gas. lolz
While I can appreciate how fast this car is it’s just boring to me. No glorious exhaust note. No heel toe downshifting. It’s just doesn’t have the things that makes driving a car fun.
Sloppy handling. And what's with all the micro turning of the steering wheel?   I'm NOT criticizing the driver btw. Good job with a piece of S417.
Boring uninspiring modernity is cancer
The crazier part is, its a 5 seater car with 2 boots.
Wow nice engine sou... Ah no
trash car lol. long live ICEs
love it
With this autopilot I would sleep easily on 5km road to work .. amazing performance and skills
Makes me sad that this is the future of card. It doesnt sound fun
lolololol I would not feel safe in the slightest driving this fast at 10 and 2 the entire time. mad props to the driver
And if you want, you can bring your whole family around the Nurburgring with you!
the car just seems terrible at turns ... i'd be disappointed if I got it at MSRP
damn this is so sick
hahha the actual speedometer of tesla shows 4 mph extra lmao
Did you find that there is 10kmpr difference between tesla speedometer and custom speedometer...I think tesla is playing some illusion..Kinda we have more speed
154 mph entering turns ?!?!?!?!?! 😱 that’s insane !!!!
Still substantially slower than the Porsche Taycan, with 235 more horsepower.
Peope are exxcited but my God besides nice screen power and aerodynamic brake it looks so shit correct me if im wrong but suspension and handling looks awful
Jesus 7:01 this thing is flying at 245 miles
The sound of tyres crying for their lives
you can literally hear the weight of this car
Hats off to the Stig 👏🏾👏🏾!!! This is now way past thrill territory for me.
Man’s did exceptionally well for having street tires
I’m gonna assume those aren’t the stock brakes, cause they’re literally like Toyota camery brakes
all i hear is creak
Makes you wonder what a stripped out , caged , with real race tyres and suspention and breaks would be like in 1 of these cars :)
tires are overrated anyways
Top speed made here by this ev is 268 km/hr I guess..
Is it km or mile per hour on the screen in front of the driver?
This looks like it's on 8x speed. Wouldn't want to be passenger.
It's not a Porsche 911 turbo S :)
The driver was in a hurry because he left his cell phone unlocked at home......😂
Impressive, but it's no 2000 Honda Accord.
Geeeez...........what a BEAST.
The camera angle just doesn’t do the acceleration any justice. Without any motor noise it’s almost as if the driver is playing a video game
Nikola Tesla is happy about this!
Dear Elon,  If you see this, please may I have one?  Thank you.
Very impressive, but can you play bass?
Impressive that test, the car's performance on a high performance track, demanded a lot from Tesla. Congratulations
Need to understand how much the one pedal driving helped here… I know I use it all the time to get to Target in 22.2 seconds
7 minutes 35 seconds. Lolol. There are so many cars faster than this plaid. Where do I start?🤣🤣🤣🤣
That steering wheel is cursed.
Listen to all that understeer lmao Garbage car
Bel telefono. Le donne preferiscono il sound ed i cilindri.
This is so like the gam gun turismo on my ps5. And the tire sounds
So fast
Interesting how much the Tesla speedo is different from the calibrated aftermarket device.
How to minimize range:
Sounds like a golf cart.   Can't wait for EVs to take over.
When will it be able to do this in. Autopilot
Looking for all the triggered kids that can’t handle the fact that this will gap any hypercar at a 5th of the price
Tesla should start their own car racing league. Promote, development and so on.
This Car is Biiiiig fake
2003 m3 with just 350hp did it in 7:50. So almost 19 years later this result is not impressive, it os even bad result.
Is the speed in mph or km / h on the dashboard?  Probably km per hour, otherwise it's too fast in miles))
Under steering milk float!
Inducing oversteer at corner entry in order to turn the car.....sexy
Need New Exhaust!!!!!!!
Drive it like you stole it literally 😂😂😂
Well I just held my breathe for 7 minutes and 45 seconds.
understeering gode mode 'on'
This is rocket science!!!
did we just see how the car drives on the track? and that's it?
Feels bad for the tiers, tho that straight speed is insane
Everytime the car accelerates, the engine sound is very futuristic. The sound of the future!
Damn, this shows that this car is trash in every way😂
The smaller steering wheel is to save spacex for his massive balls.
Watching this in 2X speed is wild 😂 Looks and sounds like he's about to take off and fly on the straightaways.
Plot twist: after this tesla gonna r&d combustion engine😂
He must not have pushed it enough. I never saw a shift light flash.
Those brakes are working overtime to slow that thing down, peaceful to hear the nordschleife in silence
Gut out the interior and add better suspension and tires and u will make any middle aged man with a Porsche run for their lives
Yo subiendo el volumen porque no escuchaba el motor🤡
zonda r 6:46
for a perspective a honda civic type R does it in 7:43, its not THAT impressive as the figures of its insance acceleration are.
Thanks for the raw, original 'music' ❤️
ZZzzzzzzzZzzZzZZZzzzzzzzzz
I can't believe it how stable this car is
This is so wrong
He can sure guide that mobile laptop around, looks like it's the geeks that shall inherit the earth!
Still only 3 seconds faster than a Miata.
good job, tesla. next time try that turn on the Auto Pilot and do this challenge.
Lots of sawing at the wheel (yoke). Is the handling that shit?
Tesla keeping the "American cars can't turn" meme alive. Great service to our nation.
looks like a handful
Did anyone else catch the two digital displays measuring speed are not in sync?
Holy shit Hy shit Holy dhit  Holly
Sadly, you're not making a Model S Plaid + Performance 😢
That looks fast
Trouble going past 266, for 1000 hp thats not great
Doesn't say who was driving !
It's nice and all. But I miss dead dinosaurs boom noise.
Yawn
Yawn.
>has 1000hp+ >Is only 3 seconds faster than a civic.
what a mad man
This is gonna need seat ejection like a jet.
This is slow asf around a track
no soul
impressive for an American built car. a bit creeky in the cabin though?
Just listen to that engine Purrrrr.  We’re  also going to need new tires and brakes after this !!!
Thats a pain :D
Were the tyres changed to other racing tyres for these trials? Or are they the original production tyres?
Абсолютный рекорд Нюрбургринга среди доработанных ( модифицированных ) автомобилей серийного производства ( допущенных на дороги общего пользования ) принадлежит новому Porsche 911 GT2 RS MR 991.2 ( MR —﻿ Manthey Racing ) с временем круга в 6:40.33 минуты.
Doesn't change the fact the only douches drive Teslas.
is it kph or mph?
Fascinating. Does anybody know why the driver jerks the wheel most of the times he makes a turn?
weak lol
That is insane, I love all you can hear is road noise and the absolute horror of the tyres ❤ what a machine.
Engaging sound makes me horney
Ill stick to my slow 8200rpm B16a EK. Keeps me awake. The sound of WOT in a tunnel and the sound when it echoes off downtown office buildings and racetracks is priceless!
How about the brakes?
Is it just me or my brain just fill in the "brrahhhhhh *clank* buurrrahhhhhhh" sound by itself. OK, I think I have played to much racing sim.
Did he crack the windshield?
That wheel still terrifies me, if you were to lose control and have your hands come off the wheel it would be nearly impossible to catch the wheel
269km =167mph crazy for a Tesla
Guidi bene
Just like GRAND TOUR IS MO. BUT NEEDS MUSIC.
Can somebody help to explain why the speed on the dash board is different from the one showed on the screen in front of it?
pretty boring to watch and listen in my opinion
Give it a proper steering wheel 😤
The corners can't seem to keep up with the tesla speed
If you want the TrackHeads and ICE fans to be on-board with the EVs then it's time to start making lighter, more nimble performance EVs with less power and less weight. Find the perfect balance and you'll convince me faster. I don't want a boat with 1000hp or I'd go get a crazy muscle car.  Lotus, this is your chance! 😁
Too bad he didn’t use fart mode
LOL 3 or 4 rounds and you can boil your eegs on that tesla battery ! And we haven´t talked about the breaks ! To heavy that thing !
Watching you can feel a lot of power, but also a lot of weight!
I expected the time would be faster.
How many laps like this do the tire last? Or the brakes? Or the battery?
Some say, that he has no concept of braking.  And that he only stops to recharge his batteries. .....all we know is, he's the STIG's robot cousin!
2nd round in full autopilot mode ...
Приору догонит?
How many laps are possible?
Jak v té Tesle všechno vrže v zatáčkách
expecting to be much faster.. nearly 1 min slower than GT2
This sounds almost ominous without the noise of a gas engine behind it
Mlayune piro jo kui kok gak ono km
It’s fast but too heavy for racing, it’s going to be a long time until we see an EV equivalent of the GR Yaris.
Would love to know the setup of the car(tires, vehicle weight during test, weather conditions even though it may not impact an electric car as much but wondering if cold would effect battery performance)
ahhh...well, electric kinda interesting and boring at the same time. oh well can't say that every car engine sounds different but electric cars all sound the exact same and Fe just amplifies it.
It's hard to drive past 60 mph because oversteering is impossible and you'll die if you miss hitting the brake at the right second. Those drivers are better than the best robots.
I'm more impressed with the driver than the car.
Slow AF thanks to it being way to heavy
What exhaust set up are you running? sounds super good!
I can do that
what a boat thats embarassing
What an awfully stupid steering yoke design. Completely uncalled for and unnecessary.
I want one
god i wish these things didnt weigh nearly 5000 pounds. would be so much quicker.
320 KM/h is 200 Mp/h. Let that sink in.
What a shitty car, got no traction at all and terrible brakes. Such a shame
And that folks is how you completely drain an EV battery in 7 minutes. LOL.
The ride sounded squeaky and not very dynamic.  The Tesla fails in this type of racing that required the driver to turn the wheel.  The S Plaid is only good on the 1/4 mile track unfortunately.
Jeeeze that is a heavy beast to be running those kinds of times! Gah, so impressive. I'd love a Model Y if they were about $10K-$20K cheaper.
tires are screaming...can't you see I am fat and heavy. Love how he was able to stay at the extreme limits of the tires abilities.
in the corners it is slow too heavy
It's like being at your favorite sporting event wearing noise-canceling headphones.
This is a five seater sedan! Imagine a lighter, more streamlined car body - this thing would fly.
1:57  for the cool acceleration sound
How is this only 7 seconds faster than a front wheel drive HONDA TYPE R??? TESLA you have failed your city!!
Who’s idea at Tesla was that steering wheel, so dumb.
So peaceful and yet so breathtaking.
Crazy how I know this track by heart turn by turn from playing grand turismo my whole life 🤣
this steering wheel is a joke
This is thrilling in what way?
That took about 7:40 seconds, phenomenal 💯♥️.
that sound will never be as good as the combustion engine
So the fastest car in the world is actually about as fast as a Honda civic.😂 think it needs better brakes for this. Carbon ceramics might shed many seconds, should be atleast an option for what it costs and the way they market it as the ultimate performance car.
that wheel just looked wrong lol
trash. can barely turn
Applaud the driver. Guy was literally on the edge of losing control the entire time
If only Sabine would still be here ...
Так непривычно)) нет звука двигателя)
Initial D with Model S
Big deal. It's a gadget.  Where's the skill? The car would be faster without the driver, just let the car drive itself around the track.
7:35 the fastest electic car being so slow lmao
bruh this man is gliding
Test driver has nerves of steel. Bravo!
Wow Tesla finally came out with better brakes?
gay.
This driver has to have 200kg stones to do this speed in this vehicle lol
The steering Wheel is ridiculous
It's like to fuck with preservative, the feelings off a gas engine, mainly V8, V10 and V12 are irreplaceble
Ok now do 10 laps...
Yawnnnnnn
That 100-200 is simply impressive
Elon should unlock the FSD race mode for the ring. Maximum speed, no human error or fear.
Looks like hard work! No doubt fast but fun?
Very frantic car. I miss the opportunity to work with the steering wheel in corners.
This steering wheel is so dumb
I wonder how much battery was left after one lap :O
meh, of course bad handling for such a heavy car, compensating with superb traction control.. Cant really see fun in that. rather drive a 150hp+ RWD old car no abs/TC. that's where the fun joy and skill is. not this understeeroversteer..
Why is this thing handles like as if a 60 yo Chrysler was equiped with a jet turbine sticked to the back of it?
An uncontrollable garbage screeching tires in all curves sensations 0
racing with a steering yoke is unsettling
Bizim TÜRKİYE de adamlar yapmışlar diye bir laf vardır harbiden yapmışlar ben   sanki içindeymiş kaptan benmişim gibi hissettim yeterince etkileyici idi.
Something like this would make the design of the steering wheel more sense. Not for everyday driving.
boring
wtf is this?
All that plastic noise shows the quality of the build. Awful. It’s speed is nice but not worth $90,000 +
That’s so boring. Fast but it feels so wrong for NOS
Its time that a Electric car comes into the market which is easy and affordable like the model T Ford was for the motor car industry. EV needs to replace internal combustion cars. I love Tesla.
The card in the middle doesn't move👏👏
I love their engineering and technology, but I do not like Tesla cars. Too much like apple. Their way and only their way for everything.
Incredible
Surprisingly those shit brakes didn’t give out
Fuck I love that noise! Sounds like a jet taking off! The future looks fast!
I've driven a lot of different cars around here and other tracks, and sorry to say, but that looks terrible. Tesla: Please just forget about performance, that's a given with an EV and not relevant in a road car anyway, and concentrate on handling and driving enjoyment.
Elon Musk: Tesla modelo s plaid at nürburging  Me: Drifting in nürburgring with Tesla modelo s plaid
지린다 지려
Homies pushed this thing to the limit
Who's the driver?
lap time?
Wow amazing acceleration, iam sure it had custom brakes and not the flimsy one off the factory
Gran turismo 7 is already launched?
And i thing , the tolerance of steering wheel againts car move reactions is not good
Its nightmare , its scary anyway , without sound , i dont wanna sit there 🙂, but  hollyshit mf fast
4:29 Imagine loosing grip on corner? I hate Tesla. Why does it have to be so 'Different'
that half steering wheel is def not safe looking
For a car with over 1000 hp that isn't a  particularly impressive lap time....
Sounds like at the dentist.
🤢
Model S Plaid at Nordschleife*. There, I fixed it for you.
This feel like assetto corsa when I downloaded a car with sound issues
You can clearly see it's software limited to 166 mph or 268 kph. Yes, he's essentially driving a brick around the track, but it doesn't help times at all on the straightaways when he can't accelerate past software limitations.  Perhaps we expect too much from a 4 door passenger sedan. Lmfao! 🤣  I wonder how the roadster 2.0 will do?
not so impressive
Question, Isn't there too much steering input by the driver there? I would like to know your ideas
Poor tyres . Like electric fright train on tyres ! Soo heavyy!
maybe if the stupid screen at the center was missed he will be a lot faster
I like that electric sound
like a bullet
feels like it's always about to take off
The shift lights aren't working.
Simple amazing!
Even a RS3 could beat it on Nürburgring... but ok it's still a fast car
Can you imagine formula one racing with electric motors?......it will loose much of its appeal without the revving of the combustion engine.
Wauuu  gogeus !!!
Que carro em meu querido
Kommt dieses knarzende Geräusch vom Auto? Man hört es verstärkt in den Kurven.
wonderful!
It’s nice not as stable as the Taycan tho
Is this the fastest lap time?
I can only bet theres going to be huge after market options for the suspensions of these cars.
This is the car to buy if you love the sound of rubber making contact with the road.
If you don't watch the video and just listen ... you can imagine a spacecraft in an interstellar space going through some gas cloud or something where little particles hit on the outer structure of the craft and make noises as they disintegrate on impact
So, you’re saying it’s almost as fast as a $40k civic? Yeah, that’s cool, I guess. Good work, team.
Battery from 94% -> 57%
the car is so heavy it slides as if is on ice...
this car will never be an endurance racer :)
This much power needs carbon-ceramic brakes and stiffer sports suspension with different anti-roll bars, coils, springs. The typical American sedan is all about comfort, I bet the tuned version with this power unit will have a much better result!
All due respect, a 7:30 with 1050 horsepower isn’t very good... a Civic Type R with a third of the horsepower AND the restrictions of front-wheel-drive will lap the ‘Rinf just ten seconds slower.
The time is kindy disappointing
The scariest part would be driving with no audio clues
that driver probably had some hard time with that stupid "yoke"
realizing that a stock 2017 Honda Civic Type R with 305hp completed this same track in 7:43:80.. makes you realize just how important good brakes and power to weight ratio plays.. 1020hp but 4700+ lbs on a track with over 70 hairpin turns im sure puts a lot of stress on those front tires early on and those under powered brakes definitely limited the driver from completing a faster lap time
I think I have to change my tires just watching this...lol
Even in a game  I cant drive without crashing at high speeds;  let alone doing this in real life
GPS nerde aq
Kudos to the driver.  He was putting in work with that heavy ass car.
What an insane car
只剩滑板鞋的声音, 摩擦摩擦
Yeah those tires are dead lol
Weird. I only just realised that this is slower than the 2017 Alfa Romeo Giulia QV - i thought the Teslas were beating all-comers. Why are they slower than some production 4 door saloons. Just curious.
Maybe tesla will become the future of ev race cars if that ever happens 🤔
Que miedo ese volante, como se te resbale un pizco, la cagamos.
What‘s that creaking sound? Shear forces on the chassis?
add robocop theme in the background
2:33 WTF
Scary fast
I've been seeing bmw guys flying (haha)  but this is Tesla Plaid .
Now what? A standard 911 GT 3 drives this in 7:25 with less than half the HP. Electric cars are just dogshit race cars.
Great, next lap driver only needs the other half of the steering wheel to drive it properly.
Slower than an alfa gulia qv🤣
Topped out at 166.5 mph.
Yawn….
A heavy car
Look at how many small adjustment need to made while attacking the corner!!!  while also how insane the acceleration is even after 150km/h
Now if it was AI that was actually driving...
Wow you can really hear all the cheap plastic flexing and kracking
straight pipe exhaust notes :)
Gotta be a way to dampen that power steering on a track like this. Fighting to keep smooth in corners and almost loosing it.
I have grate idea believe me sir i will make your tesla more then 100 t
if it had a bit more downforce tho :)
car frame creaking noises you normally can't hear in a typical race car!
He’s going plaid.
Are you using Shell V-Power?
What a terrible stirring wheel :(
Hope Assoluto Racing will add this model in the next update
if this was done with the roadster v2, that would be amazing
5:28 excuse you.
Whoever thought that KITT style steering wheel is a good idea is an absolute moron. Elon probably, the richest person in the world.
Is that speedo meter for real though or its something else. Because is 220+ is that mph or km?!
Imagine making a video just for people in comments discuss about tires.
this driver steers continuously - you can't drive fast like this - that has the effect of worn out tie rods. If you want to see how to drive around the Ring without constant overly nervous steering movements, please take a look at the Ring cab rides of Sabine Schmitz or, even better, Walter Röhl. Can Tesla afford a good driver????
This car is more than 30 sec. slower than a 500HP Porsche GT 3. This has nothing to do with a sportscar.
The fact everyday people can drive this monster is scary.. it actually doesn’t make noise whilst going faster than majority of super cars..
not too bad for an absolute brick
It goes from 100kph to 200kph as fast as my Suzuki Swift goes from 0-40kph
How did he deal with the brakes on that kind of long track!?  I thought those were horrid for this car?   Idk what to believe...then again maybe the time would have been even more insane with better brakes?
How about a full autopilot lap 🤨🧐
goona be even faster once the limiter is removed
ehh only 10 seconds faster then the civic type r lol
like an airplane
Plot twist: it was on autopilot
so.. around 40% of the battery for this.
I am not very much into racing and stuff but...is that yoke supposed to be that wobbly ?
Wow, this "car" just goes straight 😂🤦🏻🤷🏻‍♂️ Go watch Alfa giulia quadrifoglio 🍀 kicking this Tesla "" "" "car" "" "" the ass ... a car it's not just insane acceleration, short time 0 -100 ... it’s more than this.
Poor cornering, just too heavy and poor aerodynamics effeciency, that drag is of the roof. My review is strictly rejection. Re submit it to planet pluto.
Amaizing to much!!!!!! Cool man.
T ❤️
Sounds like the bat-mobile and considering the speed it might as well be one.
Looks a bit sloppy.. Steering over ?..?
Mph anyone?
Suspension looks way too soft, but i guess it probably is bone stock. Imagine a Tesla GT3 car, insane.
the boring way to go in a track
nice car but whats with the sterring wheel, for mom and pop thats just stupid
Amazing Technology, Deployed Worldwide Through My Deep Learning AI Research Library…
It's kmph right???
Tesla roadster...
Profissional esse piloto
Tires cry for 7:35 minutes
Bro that thing almost hit 300mph without a stutter
Lol this is fake
Tesla, habe you guys ever considered making a hot hatch?
Um dia será que teremos a tesla race? Só vale motor elétrico. Ia ser louco de ver.
Mit dem Lenkrad? Der kerl hat balls 🤣
Why the HUGE difference in the speed the xtra display shows and what the Tesla display shows?
Cool, but 6 seconds slower than an m5 cs which has 475 hp less
I still can’t believe there’s an actual car today with that kind of steering wheel. So scifi.
m/h or km/h?
Lo que marca el tablero es millas o kilómetros por hora? 😱
хуйня тесла двс лутше
the best time is Porsche 911 GT2 RS MR 6:40.33
This makes me wonder...could they program the track in to the car to have it self drive the fastest time??? Woah!
160 mph with a cracked windshield! haha
Space sedan doing work
Why don't the displays match? 7:06
this tesla with limitation 165mph?
I wonder how much battery was left at the end. Ha
Hmmm  I wonder if the aspark owl will beat the Tesla roadster and the rimac nevera the s plaid
That steering wheel looks more dangerous than anything else.
I'd imagine it may be harder to drive without an engine making sound through gears and having that feedback?
driver is... just amazing.... Huge respect.
Needs Potenza P0 og Michelin 4S tires!
Forza Players think that they can do better.
That's fucking nuts
He’s fighting so much with that car smh
Think the driver would prefer a steering wheel over the xbox controller
Ev's are obviously going to be the future. I just hope they are not gonna be like tesla vehicles. I haven't driven one but they seem unintuitive and the design interior and exterior is not really my thing. Big ass tv that makes you search menus and now this steering wheel.... 🤷‍♀️ But that is subjective I guess.  But at least they're attributing to ev development 👍 The silence is a thing that requires getting used to. Unless you buy a mercedes. Then you're gonna sound like a star wars pod racer 😁😁
Thank god this man knows the track, it’s contours and dips. One imperfect line at those speeds and it’s taking a hop, skip and a jump into the barrier 🤣
Great driver.First time i saw it,gives me the impression of a Ford Transit van with 1000HP,similar handling ,rides the waves like a true whale.
I predict a lot of accidents as drivers used to the audio feedback of a combustion engine fail to understand how fast they're travelling until it's too late.
he is taking corners at 190kmh... bro....
Sooooo seeing the multiple Plaid crashes resulting from brake failures and Tesla recently announcing carbon ceramic brakes as a option coming in mid 2022. Going back tracking to the Nurburgring,  was THIS a production car Plaid or a modified Plaid? Something isn’t right.
the most silent lap of the nurburgring ever!
It always looks so much slower in first person perspective!
On board top.
Safety score of 0 for this guy
Wonder what his safety score is?
World record ?
What a fucking driver!
Serious driving here.😨
Is it just me or does the steering wheel have way too much movement I like the suspension and the power but the steering wheel is just a little odd,
Tesla model S Plaid
Those tire noises made me feel ill
It’s a rocket!…no. It’s a plane!!.. no. It’s a Super Tesla!!!!
Plaid baby! 😎
Great driver at the edge.
6:49 smoooooooth   love it
The guy should be exausted after that run
Really bad driver 🤮
Very mesmerizing performance! Although, our golf kart makes the same exact sounds when we get on it.
Wow!
TESLA SAVE DRIVER FROM BEAR ATTACK NOW !!!!  https://youtu.be/S-HXnI5AmWc
Do they have charging stations along the course?
Give it better brakes
Autopilot with autosteer was clearly on so this is cheating!! Lol
RIP to the bug on the windshield at 3:36
A so pota Madre!!!!... yo me cago solo de verlo... imaginate ir dento!!
@6:56 just floor the gas…. Just why
that engine sounds so glorious and agressive whn the car acsilirates XDD
Next lap record driven by FSD.
Feels like steering wheel going to break
Just remember guys, this is the exact same model you get if you buy a model S.. this is not a race car, its a family sedan kappa  with a few little modifications to be as best as it can get on this track, but none matters in normal roads.
Sounds like NFS1 on Sega Saturn.
No engine sound , i cant be used to it..
Is this a stock setup?
One of the best sounding car
GT63 AMG > Tesla Plaid.
This makes want to play Grand Turismo so bad.
Drive yolk steering like F-1.   But I don't think it suits real highway or street.
Interesting how much you can increase motor rpm, as now electric motor can go in very high rpm's like 100000 rpm. And this one is only 20000, probably limitation of motor case material :)))))
car of the future
Trash chassi
It couldn't push above 267 kmh, thats awful... It's like too much acceleration but very low top speed
Warp Antrieb
素晴らしい❗️
This was easy compared to what he is used to, great driving.
Creaks and Rattles like a motorhome..looks like it corners like one too.
he seemed glad it was over and done with.
Electric cars are beyond gay
Una pija ese volante... Le saca toda la diversión.. Parecen 2 consoladores
@salomundo cuando uno así??
Audi RS3 was faster
Why so quiet
Tire temps and breaks must have been off the charts, on the verge of catching on fire 🔥🔥
Хотим видео снаружи на Нёрбургрин
This is absolutely ridiculously fast 😂
I would’ve died 100’s of times omg
90...1 second later...215km/h mygad

#TESLAWaterCar
Its a car o a Space X rockett ???
I can feel the pressure of this driver driving this car.
а чё русских коментов нету ?
Imagine if it had proper brakes
Meh not that great. Finished around 90th all time for production vehicles. Just goes fast in a straight line but can’t corner bc it’s so heavy and the braking is atrocious.
速度と静かさのアンバランスに違和感を感じる映像。新時代の到来！
That's a shitty engine sound
We want ambian light system
wow there are real emotions and drive pure fun just through the video of how he drives. really he would have stopped and set the car on fire, everyone would have had more of it and the other people still go crazy on the car. how can you find such a car great or cool but no wonder with humanity nowadays with corona you get so insane
Driver just reduced 50% of the brick's total usable life in that lap.
Alfa Romeo Giulia QV 7.32 lap time . OK bro!
Классно, plaid сразу выпустили после презентации а кибертрак спустя несколько лет так и не вышел, этот предзаказ на кибертрак полное разводилово на лоха
Incredible video 👍
Just 7 seconds faster than the type R. WhAt An AcHeIvEmEnt.
Just imagine travelling at 100MPH and thinking to over take this 80MPH hour you turn on your blinker and check mirrors, nobody there. *sees plaid fly past at 220+MPH
nice drive ing  pretty crazy fast right on
The steering design makes me so uncomfortable.
Acceleration is unreal!!
Now take it rallying
que nibel :o solo para soñarlo :')
As a sim racer who has done many laps on the Nordschleife, this car seems massive in (acceleration speed)  but to be extremely understeery in the corneres. Doesn't really give the message of confidence to me, this lap.
Can’t believe he’s still following the sat nav 🤷🏻🤔
Pelos de punta.... Basura eléctrica. Inmortal Joe leche materna.
LOVE ❤️ Tesla ❤️💟💯💯💯
Which tyre set have been used?
와신기하네... 역시 가속이엄청나군요...
🤩😍
Watch that speedometer
Que lindo bro y buen piloto
thats Knight Riders (KITT) steering wheel!
Sounds like a jet. Wow love it
doesnt look like it stops that well
The car sounds and feels dead it’s super boring
thank you tesla for making  a car that works... the stirring wheel/level/yoke thingiie.. that wasnt even an issue... i think the car maxes out at a speed of about 250-260mph..
The Plaid I got to drive had terrible brakes so I really can't believe this was done with fully stock car. Brakes feel like they are from 90's corolla. (some exaggeration in this for sure.)
Was it completely stock or had it semi-slicks and another suspension?
And this is just the beginning
Good job, but it´s too heavy. Create a track model, half the batteries with half the range of course, it should fly
The speed is in miles or kilometers?
Sounds like hard work on the tyres
I was around this track 10 years ago as a passenger in a Nissan GTR lapping 7:50. It was driven by an ex racing driver in traffic. Given how much more power the Tesla has and that he is driving it to the limit it sure does seen like the handling has a lot of improving to do. It looks so unsteady compared to any fast laps I have been around the ring.
Interesting to compare this to the other laps being performed now cars are being delivered and taken on trackdays, clearly this car has got entirely different stability control programming as when it steps out it is clearly not pulling the driver back in, allowing him to go vastly quicker than the final production cars. I hope this is offered to customers or these cars are basically useless at the thing they are being marketed to do (track driving).
So it's about as fast as a RS3, M4, and M5. Not bad.
🤯🙂
was this is kilometers per hour or miles per hour
It could be the record for an electric veichle, but it's not an impressive time at all, considering the power. It seems Model S has a very slow chassis/suspension system... not a sport car at all. 5 seater everyday use sedan Honda Civic Type R that costs one third, did it just 8 second slower. A proper Sportscar with just a bit more than half of the horsepower of the Model S, did the lap 40 seconds faster! (Porsche 911 GT3). Furthermore: in a Porsche you can push until the tank is empty... will the Model S do a second lap without overheating the batteries?
PONELE MUSIQUITA, QUE ABURIDO SIN SONIDO
How many mods have vs factory model ?
Those poor tires
Fast lawnmower, how is battery after that ride? 30%?
Quickest way to lose weight...
After a fast lap “find the nearest charging station”
wow
tesla met a l amende beaucoup de voitures thermique !    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axFnGYFCNKY  et vive aussi  la Volkswagen I.D. R Full EV Monster  !!
sound like piece of sh*t
Чувак все время подруливает этой палкой... Посмотрите него... А ещё Тесла...😂😂😂😂
That did not look easy flinging a heavy car around the track like that!  Surprised the batteries didn't die!
That understeer though..
I Hope Tesla come Indian market very soon..
did the car use stock brakes?
An Audi RS3 does 7:40 with only 400BHP on board.
7:35 is shameful for "1020" HP. Those lap times are achieved by Honda Civic R and VW Golf GTI, both of which have 1/3 of the horsepower of model S.
Hope 'Fresh Pants' is an included extra with the Model S!!!
This guy knows the track so well.
it feels like an interstellar to me xdd
I think F1 Safety cars and Medical cars are replaced by Model S Plaid to make it faster to catch the leader of the race or rescue race drivers from a fire, horrible crash and a dual car crash
How to make drift with this car?
Can we see another race but with. Maybe pirrelli's?
Thought the speedo was reading MPH at first and wondered where they got that god-tier tyre compound.
A car with no soul  horrible 😴😴
Потная катка
1 Lap later: "New Tyres please!"
A factory car.. Lets w8 and see the roadster Btw look tesla vs hayabusa
A Tesla is not a Sportcar.
Илон зачем оскорбляеш чувства верующих в бензин
5 years ago, 3s faster, 1000x emotions : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gEdJmIVqLY&t=302s&ab_channel=AlfaRomeo
Just put earphones and listen to this at night while half asleep/ or doing some work. DOPE
Tesla is the best! :)
Honestly I wouldn't be scared crashing this thing bc the amount of safety in it is incredible.
Looks faster than it actually is. At 7:35, it is behind the AUDI RS3, and behind the Cayenne turbo GT...
I want that drive unit sound in the Model 3!
not much faster than a civic type R or a golf GTI club... wow, i really expected it to be more impressive. or maybe i just underestimated the civic type R
tesla come to formula-E
I lost 5 kilo after this
This is insane 😲
Cars without clutch, is not a real car
he was steering too much
а что скрипит то всё как в 14ке?
This steering wheel looks dangerous 😬. Besides that, not looking too bad.
This guy deserves a medal just for using this steering wh.... thing.
Mein täglicher Weg zur Arbeit.
Фигня... я так на работу каждый день езжу
In turn seems an elephant
what nonsense is this? is there a speed limit of 267 kilometers per hour in the car? garbage check-in.
Is porsche still behind us?
I think people are losing sight of the fact this is a very heavy family car running a track that has been dominated by supercars and such. Don't compare a Honda civic that was "only" 10 seconds slower than the tesla and then call the tesla a heavy pos and slow lmao. Electric cars are here and not going anywhere. It's simply an electric car running a race track. Don't get all butthurt cause it will smoke your car in a drag race. It wasn't meant to handle curves like a sports car. Ffs.
Lol this video style is giving me some porsche vibes
Mój odkurzacz o mocy 1,8 kW brzmi podobnie.
Test drivers ride alongs in Europe and China?
Shadrin~ how about a feature where falling objects accidental  falling objects set off alarm but shut off after a 15 sec. And notifying driver and emailing notice. The alarm is for theft primarily. They just over sold functionality of the siren.Hate sirens.... maybe set off when broken windows are approached...
How much time it takes on autopilot?
and with the FSD 11x Beta you can have the Autopilot driving the same speed around the track automatically. You just need to breathe and stay awake for the ride.
Looks like the driver is on Tesla autopilot :)
It's like one of those music videos where they remove the music and just keep the ambient sounds.
PlayStation
Wtf - aber ein Tacho beim Lenkrad ist doch was feines xD
The acceleration sound is sounds like you are flying a plane
Greeting from 2016 as an VW Golf GTI Clubsport S with only 310PS makes a 7:47.19 😘
근데 엔진음이없다쳐도 왤케 삐그덕거리나영
Höre ja nichts Motor ? 😬
Driver got really weird driving style, give that car Estre and hes 10s faster...
This generation v8 sounds better then de previous !
Не видел ничего более печального и унылого. Машина для тех, кто не любит автомобили.
shit car at the nür!
it doesnt seem planted. great accelaration tho.
Я еду в красно-белое , а на часах 21:59
Normally when I watch cars go on the Nürburgring, you don't hear as much tire squeal. Is the Teslas downforce/traction bad?
Amazing view
Sounds like jet
Sure it’s fast, but what a shame of the extremely poor build quality for a car that costs that much… Taycan S money for a car with less than Dacia build quality is as insane as the 2second 0-100 time.
руль неудачный а так пушка
all original parts?
Might as well just play the ps5
This is what it sounds like if i cant hear my friends bcs of the engine sound in the game so i turn it on 0% to hear the tires and my friends
Hell yeah!!! Who is this driver??? Very fast. 🙏🏽
Who is the driver??
Нормально так валит!
Sounds like a turbine engine
this steering wheel is a joke
Hab mich die ganze Zeit nur auf den Riss in der Scheibe konzentriert und gewartet, bis dieser immer größer wird. ^^
That steering wheel is a joke.
日本人いる？
I mean I’m very impressed by the acceleration and the overall speed of the vehicle, but I could just never drive something without the sound of an engine.
am i the only one who is not impressed? this car has more than 1000 hp and awd and still needs 07.30…
What a junk car!
track mania in real life
when the gf told that she is home alone
I never can not afford a Tesla! 😞
Das Lenkrad ist von Kit geklaut
Tesla is much better than a gas Car, gross
Gostei não, muito barulho interno de plástico batendo, meu celta faz menos barulho. 🤡🌝🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Celoko! Que carro sinistro 😱😱😱😱👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
daamn 🔋🔋🔋
James May's visible confusion when a great and comfortable car can still whip it around the Nurburgring
Low battery, please recharge
The understeer on this thing...jeezzz...
when I’m just playing this game in real life: I will crash..
You can See the weight in every corner, but the Time is impressive.
this is very depressing. can't beat this fucking thing with a petrol engine.
Pretty cool
Che figata il sibilo dei motori elettrici. Auto pazzesca
Autopilot going crazy
Something a tesla doesn't have that even a geo metro has, is a soul.
Is it Elon musk that’s driving..?
I cranked up the volume then I remembered it wasn't necessary.
How many laps could Plaid hold this pace in regards to battery?
is this guy late for work?
I didn't expect a normal racing suit for the driver. The spaceX suit should have been used instead, would be way cooler. But still an amazing Lap!
I wish to do this my self
It sounds so boring...Nothing against the car. But I think half of a race car is how it sounds.
This Tesla Plaid is one of the fastest car in the world with the Rimac Nevara and Bugatti Chiron and when you think the Bugatti Bolide claimed a 5:23.1 Nürburgring time it make you ponder and stop a few secs.... I know it's simulated stats and it's a track only car but still 5:23... ooooff
The fact that tesla just posted this like a raw file. They are just letting the car speak for itself.
wouldn't want to get crossed up on a big slide would u
back tire : please kill me...
Replace the Yoke with regular steering wheel should slash some seconds.
So it really can not do 200mph like they claimed it would
the fact that the video ends with the car being at 69 kmh
with the rain towards the middle too! impressive
Amazing what you can overcome with power! This car is 4800lbs! That is a massive pig of a car, absolute porker! Give this driver an award for getting such a behemoth around a course that fast!
that steering wheel sure is annoying for him. other than that wow
Quick between the corners, simply awful everywhere else.
sorry, but you can’t re-invent the wheel
Probably got dinged a few points for Aggressive turning on his safety score
Towards the end the tires lost some grip due to the temerature and 4wd drifts everywhere..crazy
That yoke steering thing looks dangerous
Ha ha ha... electric cars as heavy as this is not for nordschleife. Kudos to the driver though for managing this lap time.   I drove Tesla Model S Plaid...sorry Tesla fan boys...it does not handle like a sports car!
That's pretty slow compared to proper race cars (GT3, LMP1). It takes so much time on the curves.
So actually slower than an 21' Audi RS3 lol
after that you need 7 hours charging,that neans a tesla drivers need an empty road
Stupid? the only place you need a a proper steering wheel
its so odd hearing this car going around the track because it doesn't make car I.C.E sounds. all you hear is tires and the light sound of the electric motors
The silence of the car is kinda spooky
I mean this is fast as fuck
Pov your late for school
I wonder if he's using one pedal driving mode
Tesla and Elon have managed to do what nobody has done before - create a super-fast car that isn't fun to drive.
Stig,is that you?
Ooooh, poor tires, they are working overtime. The acceleration is mean.
Gran Turismo nailed it looks so real
Things that don't see a second lap at the Ring:  Tesla's tires.   Tesla's completely discharged battery after a single lap.
Only the spectator would complain about some noises. Real, Drivers know how fantastical this motor vehicle could achieve.
Porsche Taycan flat out 260 km/h, Tesla 266 km/h  - but claims to be able to reach 320 km/h!
You have to work a lot to reach the handling of a Porsche and forget this dumb steering wheel.
Bravo Sir!!
Rip tires
That was the most boring lap at Nurburgring I watched
is the speed in mph or kmph
What an horrendous experience...
I wonder if the batteries were at half charge to save weight. Gotta think about these things folks.
this thing is fast af
is this a stock alignment? seems very balanced for a production road car.
Elle tiens pas la route cette voiture, c'est uniquement pour du drag
маловат телик. в будущую модель надо вставить хотя бы 30 дюймов
The handling is so bad
is like a train
gg
Silent but deadly.
This is game play, not race. Not interested
shit car
Now I wanna know how many laps can it do like that ? 🙂🙃
Elon: only 167??
Professional driver I'm guessing.  Looked like it took everything he had to keep it on the road.  Still, pretty impressive machine.  But of course that's to be expected given the billions of our tax dollars Tesla was given to make these things.
Fast for a Fenwick
Wenn der mal umgreifen muss und daneben greift… 🤷‍♂️ weiß ned ob ich das lenkrad so toll finde.  Zb Karre bricht aus und man muss Gegenlenken..
269 kph top speed. It's a joke.
At 0:40 I realized this driver wasn't messing around. Skidding toward the wall is a butt clinch moment, no doubt!
after this the owner took his family to mcdonald's
Message for Elon musk you need to made a new model car right now. 😂
На вид очень тяжелая и валкая, абсолютно не рулится, единственное, что в ней есть - это мощность
Lol this car is so twitchy it's like it seems like it's driving on ice.  Look at the way it exits the corner at 4:33 I have never seen any car jerk around like that at that position.  Whoever is the driver is a pro, a lesser mortal would have likely driven this to a wall.
You hear that flawless downshift
Ha Tesla plaid is still slower than a Audi R8 v10 gen 1 😂😂😂😂
269kmph!
You can barely hear the exaust.  That is really quiet!
Slowly we are reaching the reaction limit of pro drivers with these types of cars 🤣
Might be fast but you need to sort out the squeaky chair before I buy one. lol!!!
no sounds = no motor  no motor = no car
no car.
So we're not going to talk about how terrible the chassis is? It's amazing the amount of micro corrections he's having to do. (before someone says I don't know what I'm talking about, I'm a racing driver myself)
Hi, I like Tesla very much.  Please solve only the existing problems. For example, update the exterior design of the car, for example, put more beautiful lights on it, make the seats in the back of the car luxurious, for example, put a monitor behind the driver's seat. Make it more luxurious.  Make the most beautiful brushes, problems such as that when you turn on the car it takes 3 minutes to assemble the car itself, for example, the black screen speed is not known. Please, please solve these problems.
impressive how an suv is faster than this shitbox
kinda slow
We need the Stig to test this....
thank you so much for the uninterrupted video ... i cant think of any sport experience with out the cuts .. such a pain in the brain :)
THE GREEN HELL ON A HOOVER VACUUM! 😴  So couple things: I’m on the older side, and when they finally outlaw internal combustion cars, or charge $25 a gallon for gas I will buy a bottle of Kentucky bourbon, drink it, alone, and be sad.  IMHO Elon Musk is an asshole. Sorry not sorry.  And if THIS is what the future of driving is gonna sound like I can already tell you that I’m, not, going, to, like, it!  Yes they’re the “future.” Yes we need to quit shitting on this planet, and it’s oceans, and its air, before it creates a virus we can’t cure.  But I submit that there will never be a gutsier, more beautiful, balls to the wall run on the Ring than by Bill Wise in the Camaro ZL1-1LE @ 7:16.  Yes, yes, there are faster cars, although none to be had for the same, or less money.   But to my mind short of Ken Miles run at Le Man, and there were no in-car cameras for that, there has never been anything more beautiful. A pas de deux between man, and machine. Like watching someone equal parts wrestle a pissed off 200 lbs gator, whilst evading a charging bull. If you don’t understand and can’t appreciate that . . . then nothing I’ve written here will make any sense to you.   Gasoline powered internal combustion cars are done, the whirring of electric cars are the future, and, simultaneously the swan song of their predecessors.   It’s past time, we need them now! We needed them ten years ago!  Fine.  But fvck electric cars, I will not go quietly into that good night. At some point I know I’ll be forced to drive one, you can make me do that. But you can’t make me like it.   They are soulless.   And I do hate them.  Fire the tomato’s at will.
That looks sketchy as f*ck
Tires are bad
250 km/h and its quiter than a electric tooth brush. I can't connect any big emotions with this.
Looks hard to drive, pro was working the car well. Nice run.
Now with autopilot, please
رب زدني علما
No hateful and obnoxious gas engine noise.
Can you do it with FSD, please?
That driver is not getting the full self driving beta...
The yoke is dumb. Plaid owners on the forums all want to buy aftermarket round wheels and stalks. Out of touch about the future much?
Very poor time considering how quick it is in a straight line.
Really love the sound of that Beast when accelerating.
I think magnetic gloves would help if you want to be faster.
It looks fantastic. I love the silence and the acceleration. But 2 tons of car are too much for proper cornering.
i know weight is still the issue for electric cars vs gas car. But i think Tesla could set the record in Nordschleife i a few years.
Watching the speedometer during this run was nuts. So crazy how fast that car goes.
טסלה תשתמש הפלסטיק ממחוזר ברכביה במקום פלסטיק רגיל לאיכות הסביבה. בקילר רעיון. ומתכות נגירות ממוחזרות כמו טיטניום וטין בפטנט.
Gııccıır gıcıırrr
,,,sounds like street tires...
besides the acceleration this car is sh*t! no handling! soft suspension cheap interior according to the price!
funny how so high powered car lost to rs3 XDD. Yikes tesla, those evs ain't real cars
Drive auto pilot bro!
That thing seems about as pleasant to drive around a track as an A1 Abrams.
3:36 RIP Bug
lol someone is gonna make a mod for that wheel
The acceleration is truly stunning
It’s almost boring not hearing an engine
the illegal part of this car is probably the uglines inside, and the steering wheel is one fkcing joke xd if this come to Europe with that steering wheel.
The Audi rs3 was only 5 seconds behind.
Quick car, but I bet that 5,000 pounds is HELL on those brake pads 🔥🔥🔥
The fact that Honda made a 40k civic almost as fast as this 5 years ago is astonishing. Their next type r might be similar in time as this
Wanna see (and hear) the Stig do the same, with Clarkson, Hammond, and May in the other seats.  😉
I wonder what the drivers thoughts are on the steering wheel... helpful or hindering?
Would of been nice to see real time telemetry on this video....kuddos to Tesla doing this and on the 1/8 & 1/4 mile
Not bad not great.
And then the  brakes failed...
it needs a downforce kit, imagine how fast this thing would be
if only it have been powered by internal combustion engine 😔
That is a production car! An ELECTRIC PRODUCTION CAR! I'm fairly certain that supercars have posted slower times round the Nürburgring!
slow as fuck
와 코너 시속 100 미만에서 탈출하여 200 을 훌쩍 넘어 순식간에 가속하는 거 보소...
its crazy how fast this thing goes from 100 to 200
The steering wheel is way to stiff.
sure looks like a handfull to drive
Can we just appreciate how hard this man sent it. Wow.
He should've turn auto pilot on 😄
Subscription im Track Taiwanese food
good but where is the sound?
Он смог сделать наземную ракету по цене наземного автомобиля.  Вдумайтесь 👆
A standard, non-optimized Mercedes AMG GT 63 s 4-door: 7:27 (and also 7:23) with a lot more comfort and around 365 hp less than the Tesla.
The car looks so unstable for some reason
https://youtu.be/VZ8uOajbC0U
the scariest thing i ever seen in my life.
That acceleration is mind blowing...you're like driving a Bugatti without it's engine noise...Tesla's like Let me get  that shit out of you...
Looks like driving and old SUV
Tesla screwing themselves by not hearing engine sounds, you can clearly hear the build quality 😉
Did the windshield crack while driving at Nürburgring?
Tesla we need two door version of model s plaid, strip down all the back seat and give us cargo space instead or shorten the car!    also the option of full steering wheel and bucket seat would be great!!
Whats the ending time
I can feel the weight if this car being hacked around corners from my phone
A brakes/tires/suspension mod would make this car really fast.
To every car journalists that criticized 2000s sports car of being numb, digital and computer driven.
Boring...
I really hate idiots copy and paste other people comment the ones that have more likes so they too can have likes. What stupid society we are now with social media
that sucks, not so fast
Car gave up and died here https://youtu.be/Ujp3q_aryRA?t=458
I really don't like the steering yoke, why did tesla try to reinvent the wheel? Are they trying to make people get into accidents to force them to use autopilot?
Can we see the one that broke down and had to be towed away? Just for the laughs.
Nice! Not the production model you can buy. But a highly refined Plaid. Impressive!
Jeez, I never knew the tires were aching like this in almost every corner !
i dont know about y'all but it seemed like flying in a plane. Wish to drive one of these and I will when I grow up
Made on Earth by Humans
Everything except the steering wheel is perfect in this car
Similar price you can get this instead:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGF7AgzlPMk&t=278s
Teslas fastest car can’t beat a Camaro…
Great but what was the time? And how does it compare on the track to the big boyz?!
Tokyo drift is playing, 2:50 seconds in.
Impresionante lo que anda ese Tesla!
Mph or Kmh?
Warum ist das Lenkrad oben abgesägt? ...damit man das permanente untersteuern besser sehen kann!
Oversteer much? Lmao 😂
Congrats on filming The most boring in car lap ever filmed at the nurburgring! No gears, no engine, no steering wheel, no fun. Might as well throw it in auto pilot, same difference
What would it be like if you programmed the autopilot to run the rack at max speeds (considering braking and tire capacity), with or without a person on board...
Lap Time compared to dinosaur powered vehicles?
Those tires are begging for mercy
He drove that thing at the very border of it's capabilities as far as cornering. I thought he was going to break loose once or twice, and hit some grass. If this car tightens up on the handling, it will be practically unbeatable by other street cars because you can see the brutal acceleration on the straights.
It must’ve been weird for the driver not having to use what gear to be in through the corners
You can tell the Tesla is struggling for grip due to it being so heavy and a lack of downforce
So, there are still multi-million dollar hypercars, why? Because there are still super rich guys, needing to compensate.
I am so glad the kept a portion of my helmet on the camera shot :)
Front tires are the new brake pads....
That was really boring… i’d much rather be going slow and making tons of beautiful noise in an old pagani zonda.
If you improved the turning speed you’d have a track weapon on your hands
Sorry but that car is complete shit in corners
the plastic screeching when he turns the wheel 🤣🤣
Все скрипит как в Лада
Can it do more that one lap?   Can it do 26 like the beemer did and misha?
And that annually.
Sorry , that 3 quarter's of a billion.
250 shop at a cost of 2,800,000.,  return's in the quarter of a billion.
So the dinimo thing free pupetual motion or the heart of a robot.
You know you could agree to convert the transport of the company that do the conversion of garage's to cut down on cost, little deal's like that would help, more converted the more maintenance, same can be said the more you build the more facility you need to service them.
So Elon, let's talk empire, at the moment your a car company getting what 8%, 10%, 12%, of the market, so as a regular run of the mill car company, or you go for being one of the world leading supplyer's of auto part, because every car, moterbike, truck, any transport run's on your componant's, go for helping garage's convert to conversion and maintenance shop's, you make money sellinh the part's, plus a 1% stake in the garage's, why so little, no need with quantity, owen apart of every car not just the one's you make.
Your Tesla bot is a bad idea what if they take over the world the robot can chase people around so if I buy a Tesla bot I’m putting my baby at risk of being chased,over powered,hurt,and crying……Elon dude my man that has to stop,no one likes a baby crying because they bought something dangerous
He is doing sharp curves at 100kmh wtf
Those are not road tyres on that car you took a corner at 190km/h no normal road tyre could handle that.
I hope this future never comes
Steering wheel stupid as shit
So slow comparing to other cars bruh
Pls do spa
Fully strip it, put a front diffuser on the front and a fat Wang on the back it'll shade off a few seconds
Not enough thanks goes to the people who research, test and make tires to keep us on the roads.
Absolutely insane, WOW!
When a stock weight e92 m3 runs 12 seconds faster with 600 less hp…
The fact that thing has 1200 ft of torque instantly anytime you floor it scares the shit out of me, from 70 to 150 in a blink of an eye
Can you make night vision for sentry mode
Silently fighting for his life lmao
Imagine sitting in the back seat and FSD doing this same run
So i been think clothes of the future and why can't the future be know, know if in the future all clothes can be syinthersised, like in star trek, a device that can make any clotheing then would they not need idea's and do we not create all maner of alfit's for our computer game's would it not be marvelous if we wee to take every alfit ever made for gameing in to a storage complex designed to be their ready for the day that the machine exist.
Вы слышите как в салоне все скрипит?
the control it gives
Лобовое стекло с лево трещина!
those poor tires
Not having a noisy engine, amplifies every squeaky noise in the cabin.. (And the tires of course).
sounds weird just hearing the tires squealing and no engine sounds
So, what was the time
Пердит трясется свистит как вагонетка катится ужас
yes its fast but handles like a taxi
Why you used silent mode?
This gives me anxiety.
It'd be sick if this car made the buzzing sound of the USS Vengeance as it speeds up.
That did not look like fun, brutal, like wrestling a wild pig, but it is crazy fast in a straight line.
Only 20 seconds faster than the C5 Z06 even with 20 year newer tires and 600 more hp lol. I made a good choice.
Who drive ?
YaY on my Birthday Thanks Tesla!
I’m watching this while driving my Prius.
You have cracked windshield. Rigidity problems?
That doesn't look very stable, dude is wrestling with that wheel the whole time. Also not quite the best time for a 1000hp car, too heavy to be a track monster
а как же максималка в 320???? она что то не хочет больше 270 разгоняться.
This is edited
Let's talk time i've been thinking and if their ever was such a thing as a time agency then one of their most underlaying law's should be to make sure ever sentient life form in the universe get's it perfect outcome.
Tires?
Woow very beatiful
my vaccum cleaner sounds like a acclerating tesla  7:00
So boring. I'll go watch some ocean waves.
997 Carrera s Time 🤣🤣🤣 "world Rekord" 😂😂😂😂
In Germany, any sports car doesn't count until it competes on the Nordschleife - well done, Tesla!
He can turn on regenerative braking for ERS deployment out of the corners
This is real strange considering the nissan gtr did a 7.26.7 in 2009 which is funny because you can buy a 2009 nissan gtr for less than 60k. Yes, the plaid will smoke any stock car in a 1/4 mile but the track is a different story. Another fun fact, the tesla plaid has  a 2 second 0-60, but there is no stock car in the world that gets of the line quicker than a nissan gtr, their launch control is just that good.
Driver was a paid actor. This is all autopilot
Ахуенно!
It doesn't even make sense that a normal person can buy this car.
ummm definitelty not stock. roll cage and data machines and other stuff around the dash?
Can Tesla on autopilot show better time than human on Nürburgring?
Even Tesla's own test driver agrees that tesla's dashboard needs an upgrade 😁
wonder what You will do with that steering when car starts to oversteer and slide
You can actually see and hear him fighting the weight in the corners, don't know why but the lack of  combustion engine noises makes it more  evident for me.
maybe an actual steering wheel could improve those times
We are Pretty grateful for Tesla and Elon 🇺🇸
And in the end, thay had to replace the whole brake system because it was fired.
I am a fan of Tesla and the Model S, but let's be honest: it is not made to race on a track.  On one hand, it is incredible that a 2200 kg car manages 7:35.58. It achieves this through ridiculous linear accelleration, but rather poor curve performance. OK, it is a few sec faster than the Porsche Taycan (7:42). But if you consider the immense power (1020 PS) of the Model S Plaid, I think this result is not that impressive.  Consider this: A Porsche 911 Carrera S (992) has less than half the power (450 PS) and runs the Nürburgring in 7:30.00.  Even more impressive: a Megane IV Trophy R with less than 1/3 the power (300 PS) and only front wheel drive runs the ring in 7:40.10 (just 5 sec slower!).
This car with over 1000hp was still slower than an Audi RS3 family sedan that's half the cost and has nearly 1/3 the hp. I can respect EV for being the grocery getter replacement but as of now they are no replacement for real sports cars - especially on a track.
Bet the brake discs are more warped than Prince Andrews view of reality.
Damnn its sounds like a plane
SLOW
Was this the Nürburgring Nordschleife  (20.8 km) full track?  The Tesla Model S Plaid  ( time 7:35.579)fall short compared to the  Mercedes-Benz AMG GT S ( 7:35.0   ) in the same track we will see depending on its improvement on electric vehicles… but no matter what combustion engine will be around forever.   Tesla Model S Plaid specs Price in US	$131,190 - $149,190 Car type	4-door saloon Curb weight	2184 kg (4815 lbs) Introduced	2022 Origin country	United States                         VS  Mercedes-Benz AMG GT S specs Price in Europe	€134,351 Car type	Coupe Curb weight	1645-1674 kg (3627-3691 lbs) Introduced	2015 Origin country	Germany
Elon always ahead of the pack. Where is the TESLA killer...LOL
I hate the steering "yoke" Nice time Almost as fast as Alfa Romeo Sedan with half the power ;)
Soooo over 50 seconds slower than a 700bhp Porsche 911 GT2RS then ?
the Tesla could get to the scrap after this
That's scary to watch.  Look at the input.  Listen to those tires.  Way out of its league on a race track.  YIKES!
I love the fact you can tell who in the comments is a car guy and who isn’t
That steering wheel does not inspire confidence
This thing just seems way to heavy for a track. Those poor tires are screaming in agony!
The car is quick for the weight but really needs to be lighter if they want to beat ICE records
Yikes... definitely not made for the race track lol
This is kinda unfair 😂
Imagine if Tesla built a dedicated supercar!  Somebody better build a electric f1 car in the nears future also
When your girlfriend calls you to tell that her parents left the house
On the straight aways it literally sounds like an airplane about to take off
Opposite of a momentum car.. seems fun if you like to point and shoot. But you need big ass brakes and a motor like this. I prefer momentum.
were the brakes upgraded?
whos the driver
That steering thing is stupid.
Auf der langen Geraden am Ende ist der Akku aber schon schwächer
Samir.... You-re breaking the car
How often do you need to recharge during a lap?
When your wife is going into labor and you're on your way to the hospital, but your mistress texts you "COME OVER 911" and you take a second mortgage out on your stress levels.
Now we need to see Autopilot drive this track!
How long before FSD will be able to beat the human driver?
not a record if yall are wondering
I'm just trying to get across if space really is an expanded water molecule then have you approached travel in space from that angle, and what do we know about water, were prity addept at it, it all to dl with heat transfer, applied force and dinamic frust, is force relavant.
Ok maybe not atom to atom but i'm lacking for another way to describe it.
And thinking on it if a water molecule was expanded to it invinate capacity would their not be pockets of fusion creating what we call star's and subsequent left over's creating planet's. Would it not.
So you know the star trek discovery series and the whole miselial network the spor drive that allow's for travel from one place to another, well it gotme thinking, if the vacuum of space really is just an expanded water molecule then vearetica lly could you not trevers from expanded atom to atom, just a theory.
lol phaaaa
Made me think about the 1st Mercedes/Benz,  and how it was a Crank steering wheel. Also, you were the starter motor. Another crank.  They had to have shortened the steering final drive ratio to be able to do that. I was waiting for the Karussell, carousel,  and see if his arms would cross. Barely touched on the 1st one. I've seen arms crossed over and then some.
I can watch this all day <3
Model S Toy Car Alloy Model Cars Pull Back Toy Cars for 4 + Years Old (White) -  https://amzn.to/2XTSL4t
Damn that thing is way too powerful and heavy lol. It handles like a tank. This was completely on the skill of the driver
I accidentally clicked to the end of the video and noticed just how many bugs hit the windshield and left smears of guts in that 7.5 minutes
7:35 for a 131k $ car when you can do the same time or less with a 55K$ Audi RS3. Hmm D:
The driving done here is incredible. Big ups the driver
What happens when one of your hands slides off that yoke?      you crash.     ty
gran tourismo was ahead of its time. it predicted EV sounds for cars before they even existed.
elons wet dream
🚮fix the steering wheel who wants to drive with two hands
Some facts: acceleration Tesla plaid 0-200kph 6.2 seconds- Porsche Turbo S over 8 seconds also to 250 kph the tesla is faster this is amazing it is not only 0-100kph!!! like ist was with the old Model S. And the new plaid can do it over and over again! This is also different to the old Model! The new Turbo S is a good car and faster compared to Lambo etc. but no chance against the all electric Tesla plaid. That is a fact you can measure.
Not as fast as I'd think but not bad for a giant heavy sedan
Some say, his favorite shoe is the sandal…… and that his best friend is a tree……..                     but he’s not the stig…….. he’s the stigs environmentally conscious cousin!!!
like strapping a rocket on a traktor!
Mad
Absolutely amazing
Is it MoTec exhaust system?? ;)
차체가 무거워서 바퀴갈리는 소리갘ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 가속은 엄청난데 타이어지우게넼ㅋㅋ
Anyone know how this time stacks up against other stock production vehicles? I am AMAZED that this driver can drive with such skill using that STUPID video game inspired steering wheel!  PLEASE OFFER AN OPTION FOR A ROUND STEERING WHEEL!
Wow
i was waiting for a v8 sound but got spaceship instead not bad
I reckon it could have gone even faster if the driver’s steering inputs were more refined
Anyone know what speedometer my guy is using ?
WHEN YOU'RE GIRLFRIEND TEXTED SHE'S HOME ALONE
now autopilote at 200km/h
Left steer and km speedo threw me off
Steering wheel looks shit, will be crap on normal roads
This is like having a nice meal with the mouth covered with ppf. What a jib.
Warning, gas engine drivers please didn't buy a Tesla. Because if there speedometer stop working then they can't assume at what speed is they going?
Damn, didn't know Elon was such a good driver
It’s definitely not a good track car. It takes corners terribly. Interesting car to watch though
5:22 a man, the flashbacks...
Непогано, але Porsche 911 GT2 RS проїзджає коло на хвилину бистріше
Qualche videomaker potrebbe gentilmente inserire una musichetta? Almeno si sente qualcosa🤣
What is the use of such a fast car. It would be better to make cars for cities and with great autonomy.
can someone explain to me why the tire make noises, rather than racing car doesnt make sounds like that
I was watching speedometer more than the track ..
7:44 c’est le temps d’une R8 V10
Hâte de voir les 400m départ arrêté de  Tonton Akram avec la sienne !
few years from now and tesla might do it without the driver 😂
That puts it in top 3 of EV's.
this guy is zoomin
I'd like to know more about the car's preparation for the run  Factory tires?  Regeb braking?   And so on
It's great these guys don't have to wear many things for cooling; since there's no engine, there's way less heat being made around them
The stones on this guy… we’re talking almost a 5k lbs brick rolling on the Ring full send. Much respect to the driver!
Insane driving skills!
look at the battery percentage in the lower left on the racing screen 😧
looks borinn
Model s plaid ( accelerates) Tires : ... Model s plaid : hits a turn Tires : Aw shit, here we go again.
Obviously heavy as fuck. 3 tonnes piece of shit rolling down the road. Fuel Cell would have lapped it.
People have no idea how game changing This car is. Welcome to the start of the future.
3:49 the best moment!
that's nice and all but i bet the driver would rather die than drive another car with that shitty yoke for a steering wheel, atleast put in something like gt3 or f1 steering wheel
Gran sufrimiento por parte de las ruedas para agarrar tremendo tanque.   Por otro lado, el piloto me parece que lo ha pasado mal en muchas ocasiones con este volante… va sobreconduciendo continuamente porque el peso es el que es y el coche es un tanque, pero al tener el volante esa forma peculiar hacer contravolanteos si pierdes el control (que va al límite de perderlo continuamente) es muy muy difícil. Me apuesto lo que queráis a que el piloto habría ido más relajado con un volante normal y quizá hasta unas décimas más rápido.
Tesla,electronic=nice!
POV: Elon Musk showing his driving skills.
il a du s'ennuyer le pilote à 267km/h? Ce modèle S Plaid avait il les disques , plaquettes et pneus d'origine? je doute fort!
Boringgggggg🥱🥱
6:12 almost
Why Tesla has no sound😂😂😂 It feel like it's moving
Much better video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=em4I4V-AvBo&ab_channel=N%C3%BCrburgring
The car is clearly unstable and tends to understeer. Bad engineering...
Omg do you know how fast I could get to work in this
I'm surprise it took more than seven minutes, I thought it will be a lot quicker. Is it because of bad tires grip?
Street tires?  Stock brakes?
Probably could do that all day on a single charge 😂lol
Who else knows this track like the back of their hand because of gran turismo
Alien spaceship enters the chat
The cockpit looked like gran turismo sport I had to figure out if it was
3:35 splat
Music to my ears is the tyres, Im done listening to squeeze bang devices, that motor/inverter zing is the sound of true energy resonating. Brilliant video
Everybody liked that
Fast!!! But lots of plastic noise
this is probably the hardest shit I watched all 2021 , Vehicle Standpoint. Introduction is a 10/10
Fun fact: the driver hated the steering wheel
Why is there so much play in that steering?
disgusting and dangerous steering wheel for day to day.
It's The Stig !!!!
Wouldn't call it drama free!!
Not having any sounds really makes you appreciate the skill the driver has but it also make it very boring to watch
Who said teslas can't drift
this is unreal
If we get that screen included it’s a big yes
Nice Forza Motorsport 7 gameplay
i can hear turbo battery kicking in
disgusting...
This steering wheel is just unsafe for street use change my mind
We want Tesla in India
Rs3 is faster, it really shows this car is all about single line acceleration.
Perfect Lap :)
Fine, it looks awesome to drive and seems to have a fantastic dynamic but...really??? sounds like playing Gran Turismo...i know that probably the sound is something you really don't care when driving at 200+ km/h at this insane green hell but it has absolutely NO GUTS, it's heartless...bleeehhhrrg!
love the squealing plastics inside the cabin, it sounds like a plastic bottle being squashed on every bump and corner
Oh God,they kept it real American.Goes straight like a rocket and goes in the curves like a mustang.
Driver: How many bugs do you want killed?  Tesla: Yes.
Some say when he sees a lady his third leg goes up, all we know he's called the Stig.
Shpeed
This is the difference between a driver and a pilote. He is pushing the car to the absolute limits of the track
That's yoke makes no point 🤦‍♂️
ta kierownica jest marna
The motor sound is beautiful ❤️
amazing...thought it would be faster time wise though ...its pretty far down the list but still impressive
Sound isolation so so,i hear wind...,some amg or M competition offer more car quality than Tesla..but Tesla has so much power and horn customization:),driver looks hard to handle actually
The acceleration in electric vehicles looks so quick you could miss it.
car very powerful.
Looks really heavy
The driving looks and sounds like a minivan full of marbles going down pikes peek with no brakes
Is this with keyboard or joystick ?
Holy shit that things like a fighter jet!
That steering wheel looks downright dangerous for this
It drives on railes 🤣🤣🤣
Funny how an Alfa Romeo Giulia qv is still 3 seconds faster on this track
Well... It's that easy: No Sound, No Emotions.
Why there is no autopilot? :D
That run was brutal.....all over the place
can u imagine those acerlations thats insane
Roadster lap will be madness
I don't like how weird and quirky Teslas are, but that said, I'd really like to see the new Roadster with an aero package set a lap here.
Wow that's impressive turning at great speeds
This is the model s plaid not a race car but stil it eats track
Great driving.
와 미친~~~속도감 머냐~!!ㄷㄷ 👍👍역시 테슬라 넘사
Sabine doing it under 7 btw
7:35 of fun and then 20 min charging.
The motor is a masterpiece of human creations! That thing can pull this heavy tank within seconds!
This is Hilarious... the car is a total shitbox... it caught 100% of the time up in the straights... it cannot drive turns...its all over the place...
no hate bit it really is boring compared to other laps with Petrol Cars
Pfiouuuuu !
I am more amazed at the skill of the driver than that car. Driving is like driving a Porsche without electronics in the 80s.
The Porsche Panamera Turbo S was faster with 7:29.81 with less power.....
I love the sound it makes as he speeds up, sounds like a spaceship.  Edit: Comments filled with offended motor bois and literalists.
Please I need to know what would a Bugatti do on this track, like what time would it do it in
the sci fi sounds, though XD
Looks like they've intentionally decided where and when the power would be used to get the fastest lap without overheating the battery or the brakes. Could probably go much faster
That handle lolll
When you're in forza and you turn all the audio down except tires.
Is that the creeks and rattles of the interior pieces? Shesh
piece of crap, but the driver was really good
Camry v6:  - "Hold my beer..."
Get R done
Shit! What a boring thing...he could be watching some brazilian serial in that TV while driving...
has an incredible acceleration but in turns it sucks
Did any body notice that the speedometer of the car is always higher than the one on the front??
Don’t understand that wheel!  Surely cant be controlled as good as a normal wheel?
That steering wheel 🤮
So a 1000+ hp electric is as quick as Sabina Schmitz in a van?
that steering wheel is retarded
Was this done on Stock Tires Cup Sport 4S? ??? If yes, that is INSANE!@!!!!!
RIPPING
So no one's gonna talk about the fake speedometer that Tesla gives ?
haha tesla time is very weak, 10 year old cars make the same time hah and 60k$ cheaper corvette c8 make one second better time. And this is the fastest elecrtic car? Funny
The cornering is nothing to write home about, but the acceleration.... WOW!
Нормальный руль верните
I don't get why this "record" is so hyped. The result is very mediocre compared to the price and even bad when compered to the cars with same amount of power.
this is so gay
I really love the way it sounds when it accelerates, sounds like it's charging up some sort of Lazer
ASMR?
He brakes too early on some sectors, a lot of time to be gained
💖💖💖💖https://youtu.be/bgIM95-m9wk
AUDI RSQ8 BEING AN SUV IS JUST 3 SECONDS SLOWER OMG
I would have died about 2 turns in
I hope someday i can afford one Tesla's, i really like the sensation of driving without hearing annoying engine sound  Well i must say sorry to petrol head, but i cant help loving that silent and speed excitement all in one package
U can tell its heavy just by the tyres squeaking all the time even in the lightest corner
Turns like a minivan ngl fat and wide
What's the reason for the difference between the two speedo readouts?
If the Plaid maxes out at 269kph (167mph) on the longest straight on the Nurburgring, how do they claim 199MPH top speed??....
Is he braking with his right leg?😂
I'm old school but nothing compares to a good exhaust note and motor under load
To be honest, it doesn't look like fun to drive it right on the edge. It seems spongy and imprecise.
How much battery percentage was used for one lap?
I’m guessing the Amerikan made Prius doesn’t have the factory tires on it.
Nobody wants a f’n yoke. Just watch Regular Car Review’s video about the replica KITT someone built. Dangerous. I hope this gets banned by the dept. of transportation.
You would obliterate yourself if you tried to just jump on the Track and drive like this
Looks unstable and the driver was really wrestling the car. Racing is going to be quiet and filled with a ton of heavy, tire screeching understeering cars.
yep for me at 1:19 that car would cease to exist
Every time you give it little steering inputs like that, you're scrubbing off speed and tires. I don't get it. It's not faster to do it that way. And if the car is that lively on an effectively smooth surface with very small curvature, the alignment specs need to be revised.
watch it 2x speed if you want to see the roadster spacex version
this driver is fearless 🦇
thought it would’ve beat the sedan record :/ kinda disappointed
Brakes? What are those?
Shania twain "that don't impress me much"
When you set engine noise to 0 and tyre effects to 10
Improved tires (Tesla should seriously consider manufacturing some themselves in partnership with Michelin) and a significant increase in down force (it's slippery shape is terrible for track curves) and it would be a whole new game.
That should be the new dyson v12
traction control be like 😤😤😤😤
This guy is right foot braking, so they could have gone much faster.
Nice iPhone
3:35 Tesla kills a bug :D
Top speed 268 km/h
is that MPH or KMPH?
Tesla can make bike
The Audi RS3 achieved the same time, but only costs half as much. Welp.
Sir I have one of best idea which may bring great evolution in electrical vehicle so plz help me I want to share my ideas with your CEO plz ...it's an very creative idea ...plz give me 5 minutes ...I have  invested my 5 years in my idea plz contact me , it may bring greatest evolution sir
Don't like the handle 🙄
69 speed to end it nice
7:35 Forgive me but that sounds pretty slow for a 1000hp car! Mercedes AMG gt4 coupe is 10 seconds faster.,..thats just a fact. I really expected it to be the fastest production 4 door car ever around that race track.
How tf did he not die!!??!
Would like to know what his range read after that.
What a driver. You can clearly see he's fighting the weight of the car constantly and still manages to set a decent time.
Handles like an oaf.
Tesla 💖💖💖https://youtu.be/HUlavzZhPFM
So your 1000bhp car is less than a second a minute faster than a 300bhp FWD hatch? And we're supposed to be impressed by this?
30 minutes later, he did the second lap.
Long short sad story, after 5years its gonna be the official race cars
One issue….the GT63s AMG has a much quicker time….and it has almost 400hp less, the difference in combustion engine and batteries
Yawn, that’s like tech from the 1800’s. Get on with the times Tesla!
Boring af Fun factor = 0
All the dislikes are just the EV haters who got this recommended and expected to hear the sounds of a reving engine
Accelerates like a f1 car, corners like a dog on a rug
Those electric motor sounds are therapeutic :)
Somehow this feels scarier than exciting
This car really looked like it can push some more even though the tires were screaming for help. Maybe the driver was being conservative to avoid overheating the tires and brakes, but I really feel like it can handle abit more abuse.
Its like an instrumental version of a song
Tesla needs to work on the steering because the driver was correcting trying to guess what the front wheels are doing... otherwise nice
Is this limited at 269kph? Seems like so
A thousand horsepower and all this could manage was a 7:30s lap time. Disappointing. Proof that tesla only makes road cars, let Lamborghini and Mclaren make the track cars
This thing handles like ass
Страшно но за этим будущее
Impressive
I prefer to think of the speedo in miles per hour, much more fun.
I think telsa is chiting on speedometer on console its higher then its acualy riding van someonw chwck IT
Alot of people say he's struggling to keep the car on the track, obviously it's a heavy car, but all of the weight is on the bottem, making it grip to the ground like no other car ive ever drivin.
it has about the same time as a camaro from 2014 LOL
Rip tyres
correct me if I'm not wrong, it look like, while cornering it understeering a lot.
Imagine how fast he could have been with an actual steering wheel 🤣 IJS
This is so boring...
200k for that? Yeah, no thank you. I'd rather take an SRT Viper or the Gen 3 ACR over that any day.
this is Mile per, right?
This Gran Turismo video game demo is so real. I liked it a lot... hope to see it released for PS 10. 😆
That steering wheel must suck so bad!...specially for daily use.
you can see it's way too heavy, no sports car
Wow, Elon is a pretty decent driver huh? 😅
You can see him struggle to keep that fuckin boat in line. That's not a compliment to it's speed, it's a compliment to the driver. That thing needs a real steering wheel, carbon breaks and actual downforce for a lap like this. Still, the time was impressive.
This video shows, the Model S is not build for races, the drive looks very picki an dangerous. Its a 2tonns sedan for cruising
Was it good ?
Warp speed background is missing. Steering feedback doesn't look pleasant.
The video ends at 69km/h
Imagine how fast he would have been with a steering wheel
Stig are you there?
as jeremy clarkson would say: powerrrrrr!
Those are four very unhappy tyres.
Car doesn’t handle all that well, it just gets to the next turn quicker lol
That steering yoke is a bit of a joke for anything but light cruising.
Almost looks like a video game with "motor sound" set to OFF
Exactly how many laps is a set of tires good for on this course? Jeez!
Ah, so about as fast as a 300hp fwd stock Renault. And that's not even factoring in the fact that the Renault can keep lapping, unlike the Tesla.
I just wonder how would you counter steer it with that wheel if you lose control?
It's like a roller coaster...without rails
Yes it's fast, but damn I can feel how heavy it is just from watching it. I wonder how many laps the tyres can take. I could see myself getting through 3 sets a year just with backroad driving. I do hope real drivers cars can be produced in the EV future. Not just: "it's heavy so let's throw a 1000hp at it!"
RIP Tyres 😂😂😂
Nicht sicher, ob der Fahrer fährt!
Its definitely fast but being fast is not everything on track! Its not agile due it's weight and seems has significant body roll.  Also he is fighting to steer like  adjusting mid corner like small degrees of left and right to counter and all.  End of the day it's a family car! now people will say it's skill and all but than what the point?
Ficou longe dos Porsche, BMW , Mercedes 😂🇩🇪👏💪
Good video but I have the Tesla community
https://youtu.be/z1tL0CC6cqU
doesnt look really nice to drive tbh
Hollyshit that’s impressive
How much battery life was left after the ring racing?
Some interior plastic noises. Tesla should definitely work more on quality and less on how much torque you get out of a Standart road car. You honestly can’t even use this much power on normal roads.
Los frenos eran de serie??
Fast… but fun? Looked hard work!
The noises it makes sounds like plastic is about to rip any time soon
One comment and two questions... First driver is insane with his handling this different car.  Questions: 1) Regen on low, super low, or off (I don't know if the last is possible)  2) Was that a static map image? I though I saw a location marker but couldn't find later. Can I lock my map like in games?
Too bad they limit top speed to 165mph,. Driver was amazing, thx
Hope you done have to counter steer much
The acceleration is amazing, Seemed like a lot of oversteer,. Rip tires
An out of the box production vehicle did this..... Damn!
good luck trying to use those tires again for a second lap.
It pays to be the best.  This track has been the ultimate test of what it takes to be the best.  Very unsurprising to see that Tesla has been able to pull it off!
It’s a combination between the sound of the tires and the crapy interior plastic suffering , without even a good engine noise
This dude is booking it!
boring~~ -.-;
Basically non stop sawing on the wheel
That is Insane!!! And boring at the same time.
Todavía sigo pensando quien fue el pelotudo, que se le ocurrió hacer autos eléctricos.
It must be a weird feeling driving at the limit with tire noise only ...
That steering "wheel" looks so dangerous.
That's one cool racing simulator
I would not want to drive a Tesla this fast out here this man must have been well paid
Lol is 7:38 supposed to be quick for 1020 horse power.... Give me a break. Porsche will ruin this very soon.  Horrendously slow in the corners.
These taslas are fast in acceleration but are complete shit around a track
Its like teleport to next corner ...
Migh as well buy a  F airplane by this point in time...
277 on the tesla dash and 255 on the gps one hmmm 🤔
RIMAC Nevera will do it faster and without driver. Will see this will age great XD
Who wants to see it go round autonomously? 🙋‍♂️
That stupid steering wheel though.  Who thought that was a good idea?
Yeah boi
와;;; 가속력이 말이 안된다…. 코너탈출 70에서 220넘기는데 불과 몇초밖에 안걸리네 서킷 랩타임도 이제 테슬라가 쓸어담겠구만
Listen to the plastics squeek..
without an engine, you can really hear the tire screeching
The stig on his way to work
Buy that driver a drink !!! Looks scary
I can hear James May’s disapproval
It hurts to hear all the cheap plastic in the interior :(
And to think, BMW M4 competition with 1/2 the power takes 7:30,and if you complain about size, then I got the Cayenne GTS for you with 640 horse power, huge SUV with a time of 7:35
LOL either this driver or the car is garbage; he went 40mph on some turns - I can do better blindfolded without even squealing the wheels on a straight-away like him.
🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤔🤔🤔
Jajaja
Is it just me or does that wheel look awful to use
几乎全程都在车辆的极限边缘游走，牛逼！
The yoke doesn't look comfortable in this particular this clip
Sure looks like the track is keeping it from tearing off the top layer of the earth!
How much battery % did they use up for that lap? :D
Excuse my ignorance but is that speed on the dashboard displayed in miles or kilometers?
Lap time please...
For 45k you can have a civic type R and with only 300 HP it does the same track in 7;43.  There’s so much more to driving dynamics when a car with 1/3 of the HP is running basically the same time.  Put the money you saved from not buying the Tesla for a down payment on a home.
crazy that this is a four door sedan that soccer moms will be taking their kids to practice in instead of a super car. can’t wait to see what the roadster can do.
Why so many dislikes?
It's way less impressive when you see the 45min pit stop for refueling...
Is fast but very shitty to drive it no noise , no feel of the engine ive drove a tesla and is cool the lunch thats it everything else is boring and dumb nothing can beat the engine sounds and feeling
and dont forget this is 4 seaters
Can't wait for the roadster. Omfg
Even if the Ferrari 812 wasnt faster I would  still rather drive that 100 times. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MswIflgRyTA
The waypoint triangle leaves the screen at 1:03
Just turn on autopilot
so...it is obvious that soon we can buy this car with 10 euro on NFS Electric :). The start car can be a dacia :)) or Volvo
What record did it break again, i am sure other production cars have gone round faster?
0-200 kmh it is fast, but then it is slow af
Tires: please dont push me any harder, it hurts! Driver: shut up and give me some grip godammit! Tires: you need to lose weight first!!
With an ICE revving and growling makes you feel alive and alert...electric motors just has this drone white noise...I'd definitely lose concentration
just looks like a boat floating between corners, for an electric car thats an impressive time but just for production vehicles thats not even impressive really
Elon my tyres are gonee
I was expecting much more Tesla hate but it’s just not here.
Gut the interior and put a wing on it, then we are  really talking.
Gut the interior and put a wing on it, then we are  really talking.
Incredible how fast the Tesla Model S Plaid is!
A moment of silence for the front tires😔
Nürburgring, the "Green Hell"!
Tire sounds and the cracked whindshield 👌🏼
No Roll cage? Looks dangerous for the driver?
That driver’s got a steel pair
I just came here from a Super GT video. And GT Sport was almost too realistic, especially the sounds
Wenn "Lenkrad" ein Begriff aus der Vergangenheit wird...
Is this dude’s windshield cracked near the lower left??
The pilot has a lot to do, and the chassis works at the limits.
Cool, now make a video with a 360 camera on a pole attached to the car‼️🤯
7:32 Giulia Quadrifoglio 510hp
There is ~10 km/h difference between add-on dash and stock speedometer. Got to be difference in airspeed vs groundspeed.
What kind of BOV does that have?
Will FSD try this?
Drifting a tesla feels so wrong almost illegal
needs more efficient driver
This car is just a jet
Pretty far away from the 7:20 claimed earlier this year via Twitter.
Some proper tires and some handling mods would make that a killer track car!
welcome to today's episode of U N D E R S T E E R
Carbon doors and panels, wing, interior completely stripped, new suspension, new wheels, and a battery pack that will only last the lap. Now run it again
For those wondering, the current record is 6:38.835, driven by Lars Kern in a Porsche GT2 RS on 14 June 2021.
That big "TV"😆😆😆😆😆
Remember this car weighs almost 4,800 lbs or 2,177 kg...look at the list of fastest lap times...this must surely be the fastest time...for its weight. My Toyota FJ Cruiser weighs about 4,200 lbs or 1905 kg...!
Shit
I counted 8352 steering corrections. That didn’t look like fun.
Hats off to The Stig
You can really hear how heavy the car is
This person was WRESTLING the car the whole time. Well no wonder, it weights as much as a tanks and handles like one too.
Epic run
*front tires have left the chat*
So slow for 1000+ hp!!!!
Prolly has the AC on.
This is the cheapest  Hyper the car in the world.  Enormous straight line speed
What a lot of rattles in the car.
Look how slow the car is 🙈 its slower then my 50ccm one
It is a very potent vehicle, even 4door sedan! What is the time of a Panamera turbo s ? The Civic type R does 7:43 (also 4door)
I'm waiting for an autopilot taking us to this kind of a ride )))
This must be so hard to drive with that half steering wheel, i really dont get it, ok it looks more like a submarine/airplane wheel but its much more harder to drive now
Wow, 5 seconds faster than a Megane RS TrophyR with 1/3 of the power, impressive...NOT...
Tesla should make a more track focused version/model
Shows that it’s handling is not super car levels, slower than a bunch of ICE cars around the track including Porsches 911s and Mercedes GTs even with its acceleration advantage.
Look how fast he can reach the topspeed
You don't have the be talented to drive this car just press autopilot 😜
well, you can see how the chassis is a bit of a mess because of all that weight. can't deny that the acceleration is bonkers, the drivers pushes the throttle 1 second and he gets in a instant 10s of km/h more.
So scary!
What an amazing performance from the driver,but I can tell that the reaction time of the steering wheel is just wow
😎
Tyres just about hanging onto the weight, borderline scary in the high speed stuff
That steering wheel looks scary!
Please add a Nürburgring mode to autopilot
slow
I wonder if those batteries are glycol cooled because they will be roasting. I would be watching those batteries temps during supercharging because of thermal runaway
Time? 😂
All this to barely beat a 2009 GT-R
The steering is so bad
7:35.579 at Nürburgring is what?  Which cars have better times than this?
Бесконечно что-то хрустит в салоне
I’m missing the telemetry information, it would be nice to see the speed, g force, etc. what achievement!
When you're late getting to Walmart on Black Friday.
6:47 acceleration sound
It's like a constant wreck. He's just wrecking the whole time.
cant wait to see what the roadster can do!
Girlfriend: My parents arent home Boyfriend:
Wow!
The steering input looked scary AF,, definitely not designed for high-speed turns, can hear body panels rub/flex 😬
That handle looks so unstable and uncomfortable.
Those poor tires! It must weigh 5000lb.
Now let's see him parallel park with that yoke...
7 sec. Faster than tycan
*ANGRY JAMES MAY NOISES*
How much of the charge did it go through in just the one lap???  lol.  Impressive lap of course, but still, unless it can do what a real car can do with one full tank, it's just not of interest to me yet.
If not for the braking, the wind would be just lovely.  Boring!
Beta firmware?
Perfect to take my little girl to school and do the groceries, sold!
Lame   .... hahahaha  how the hell did you manage to take the Fun out of Driving?
Crazy to think a Tesla  is only 15 seconds slower than a 2010 ZR1 at the ring.....
And what about the flat tier??!
Training FSD
Tires at the end: I am done.
Lol American cars can’t take corners properly, it’s as simple as that!
That wheel must be a pain
Now thats what I call boring.
Why do the speedometers not match up?
Sounds like a jet taking off
It's fast
Super👍
Can't hide the weight of an electric car... tyres really don't like it
Velocity without quality its A CIRCUS a ZZZZZZZZOMBIESZZZZZZZZZZZZZ entertainment.
worst is, I've seen better graphics in latest video games than this 'real 4k' video
We run this 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Beautiful sound of the naturally aspirated tire 12 engine.
That's insane.
Dammm fast fast
I cant hold the fuck*ng stering wheel omg
That silly steering wheel looks  dangerous as one could easily lose control.
Pay $40 bucks to ride the rollercoaster, pay $20 million to own the rollercoaster. I just want a ride. I don't need to own the thing. Thumbs up if you gotta brain.
Nice acceleration. But with a good chasis, you would be much faster. take a look at the handling of a porsche 911 gt3 on the nürburgring.  tesla still has some work to do there.
2:03 rebel tree?
It has good acceleration, but it swings way too much during braking and in the curves. There are cars with about the same weight, much better road holding, but of course poorer acceleration. Know what I would choose for the same price.
Looks fucking sketchy
Wow, that's not a Forza Motorsport?
3:35 birds can poop on cars moving at even 200kmh
The acceleration melted me every single time, damn!
a Second attempt needs to happen with regular wheel and a driver who knows how to not lift so much... Lap could have been much faster.
The car is all over the place. Stick to straight-line performance..
Props to the driver ،that was insane
Was expecting a sub 7:00sec time. Not so impressed, considering the power figure it develops.
All i hear is dash creaking and it’s annoying as hell
Its insane but I actually expected an even faster time... I guess acceleration isn't everything and Telsa fanboys should become aware of that.
Driver is struggling with sterling, he must be cursing design engineering 😁😁😁
Jesus look at that mass rolling (not talking about the driver) and understeering. Impressive though for such a heavy car.
I wishcould go drive on a track and push myself a little on turns.  I'm pretty wimpy to be  like I feel like the car is going to flip.  I have a late model Lexus IS so I'm sure it can handle everything fine.  But I think compared to everyone else I drive like a grandma out for a Sunday drive.  But If I could push myself and get more comfortable on a track, maybe I could feel more comfortable driving in the real world.  I live on the East Coast.  I wonder if places like Limerock have programs like that.
Such dull steering though, seriously quick but obviously no feeling and the driver doesn’t know how much grip there is
How can speed be this boring
Acceleration  0-60MPH in 1.98sec Breaks            carbon ceramic Breaks   Safety             5 star  what else do you need...?
Looks fast, sounds boring … emotionless
はっっや
Fast car Big Balls. What a great duet
Kudos to the driver, the car looks super unstable cornering with high speed.
Oh the understear noise xD
Yall should bring out a proper race car with autopilot for the nordschleife and other tracks
Boooooooooooring
and in modern 2160p 😈 proud of you fam
Plot Twist: The speedometer shows mph
why only 267 Km/h!?
Freaking awesome
Well plaid Tesla,.. well plaid,.
I like the fast subway sound on wheels
This thing has some serious power
What ugly interior Plaid as.
I think its my turn elon….
Pure ASMR
The tyre screeching was genuinely stressful….. 😬😬😬
holy sh....!!...i am so sorry for the tyres....!...plus the "silent" mode of the drive freaked me out....!!...:-)
at least we can ear the tires drifting haha
Is the windshield cracked?
Der Ton im Moment der Beschleunigung und die gleichzeitig hochschnellende Geschwindigkeitsanzeige bringen die Leistungsfähigkeit dieses Serienwagens so gut zur Geltung, dass sich jeder Sportwagenfan mit diesem Video bestimmt die Frage stellt warum er für sein nächstes Spaßmobil noch auf Stauraum und Kompfort verzichten soll!   Einfach Hammer!
So fast haha
Title should be: Model S Plaid *Playing* at Nürburgring
There's a crack in the windshield?
I'm terrified these will be available for regular people
Something sounds like it’s gonna break
Let's train the Neural Network on how to drive the ring
Weird thats about the same as a honda civic type R 🤔
No noise = no soul. Boring zzzzzzzzzzzz
so peaceful
Memba when top gear made joke about Tesla dieng and not being reliable ...I memba
Can this thing do another 5 laps before it run out of juice?  Ps. Awful steering wheel
The next thing is to let the autopilot beat the time.
This feels intense yet calming
I really want one now. Time to play the lotto
I feel like the roadster is going to be this minus about 2000 pounds.
A lap around Nordschleife never looked this boring.
Bit of a heavy pig. Great driver.
add GT3 pack for more downforce
Tesla needs a carbon ceramic brake option
That steering wheel is such a joke.. They could've least made it F1 inspired, if they wanted to do a smaller one.
so much weight, doesnt look balanced to be too much fun. just brute acceleration
Ngl that car sounds like its so fast it is falling apart but its still together. American or german engineering?. Great work to the people who work at Tesla
Super sick!
Jesus look how much that car is struggling
thing looks heavy. understeer heaven
Wow. Really thrilling experience. So maximum 268 mph high speed @tesla?
Yeah no I'll keep paying for gas
disappointing
Nice bucket seats & roll cage. Is this GT3?
Traction control can't handle the tesla
If this thing would be really unmodified it wouldnt have the right tires from the factory to do this , just fakery as always with tesla
And not one scratch was given that day...
It s so peaceful
You know it’s serious when the stig wears red gloves
Please tell me the tire brand of this car.
Still a dumb fucking wheel
isnt it weird how the plaid literally beats anything in acceleration up to 200kmh but cant even beat a 2008 nissan gtr's nurburgring record, just shows that no matter how much power you pump into a car it cant out-track something thats almost 700kg lighter from 15 years ago.
what are those tires made of? Super glue?
Tesla is fast sure, but not a fan of the interiour. The big screen is out of place in my opinion
Yup this car isnt for track, you can see it suffer. Great driving btw
Чет разница в 10км в час между спидометрами - многовато...
Ugly as hell. Without engine sound its like nothing.
When you play AC with the broken car sound mod
Tesla needs to step up their quality control.
The tyres on this thing are phenomenal.
Awesome video, but that steering wheel is still dumb as hell.
No
I love tesla 😍 ♥ ❤ 💙
Now THIS is what the Plaid yoke is DESIGNED for, NOT for normal road applications.
Can I be your passenger 😳 looks like a fun ride
This the stock car, right?
And people say forza 5 is going to better than gt7 I bet they won't have those tire sounds in forza lol
The speed is in miles or kilometres per hour ?
Gtr beat this time in 2009
I'm 100% the driver was scared for his life the whole time
Imagine if Tesla will released track plaid version with 3500 lbs weight but sacrifice the range to 250miles it will huge impact in the ring perhaps will broke records
Nah but Fr, why do they wear gloves when driving 😭😂😂 doesn’t make sense to me💀
I mean this is impressive but for the amount of power this car has, it‘s an eternity
*initiate auto pilot*
Too bad it is still limited to 268km/h.. On the straight it could have kept going faster.
Raw video with no watermark. Thank you Tesla ❤️
would be cool to see how autopilot can do this track
that's not a bad time considering the Plaid S had to carry all that extra weight of the balls from the pilot that was brave enough to track a vehicle with such a weird steering wheel
does this car have a bad traction , or is it just seems so? because it sure looks like he is sliding
Tesla Plaid drops in between a Audi RS3 and BMW M5 competition on the official Nurburgring lap times. Not bad for electric car. Is it possible to get that Porsche 911 GT2 tho at 6 mins 38 secs? Come on Elon give the Plaid rocket boosters!
Good driver
Too loudy
Fast car but horrible steering wheel if he has to catch a snap oversteer
G force accelerometer would’ve been cool to see
imagine paying like 1m for your car and it just gets easily passed by a stock 120k dollar sedan
That yoke is dangerous. Elon needs to be realistic. This isn’t a toy 😂. I’ll stick to Tesla model 3.
Ahh the famous hit miss hit corner where everyone crashes on YouTube, probably my fav part of the track besides the Ferris wheel corner ( just like nascar! )
Tesla apparently did some some major testing with the suspension before releasing this thing!  I’m impressed.
nice
I think i could actually hear the tires saying "kill me just kill me"
Unimpressive tbh
Impressive as hell. Very interesting how the top speed wasn't AS high but still what a lap time!
In forza I always fly off the track cause I can’t hear the revs or know what gear I’m in. Mad props to this driver I feel like I’d do the same in real life lol.
I...I just don't care.
I've been watching too many assetto corsa video for my own sanity
He took the inner concrete track on the carousel, This mans wild.
I love how fast it is but doesn’t seem like it handles well at all.
Don’t need all those canards and wings when you have all those batteries weighing to the road😳, and don’t ya just love how the brakes were begging for mercy the whole run😆………..impressive non the less! 🤙🏽
I know he's a pro, but I reckon if I had the opportunity I could beat his time.
Gaining speed is amazing but this is the first time I fell asleep during Nurburgring. So fucjing boring!!!
I recently saw a S Plaid drag race a Nina Super Bike and the Plaid beat it. I've never seen a production car let alone a four door sedan do that. I was just blown away.
That half wheel just isn't ideal for the track. This is a live version of my HO slot cars of the 60's and 70's
Driver occasionally tries to move his arms around steering rim. But oops! There is no rim. Somebody hand over red pill next time. Great lap.
No way this are standard brakes
Amazing Run
7:45 is a lousy time for so much horsepower!
That steering "wheel" makes me nervous. How do you regain control if you need to?
I am a Supra and Ford mustang Fan .. and I like Loud cars...But Tesla is just my dream car for now
Fast in a straight line. Turning is full time job 🤣
The FK8 Civic TypeR with only 306HP did it in 5 seconds slower.
I was expecting something under 7 min 🥲
sceeechh krkrddudd sceeeech wuuuush ngiiing
Why a battery kill switch on the left?
Tesla 1020Hp Lap 7:35s vs M3 E46 CSL 360hp Lap 7:50s 2003 year xD yes, I know a different weight, but how many horses and Nm has Tesla ... :D
the fact that its quieti s so helpful. i could listen to the tyres all day long and make better judgment
Its a rocket
Das Gewicht spürt man ja schon beim zuaschauen...ekelhaft... nö nö.. dann lieber Fahrrad im Stadtverkehr
Does anyone know why his steering is always "jerky" when going around corners. The jerking movements of the yolk just seem to be the opposite of what I would have guessed is most optimal. Interested to understand why they do that
if you observe you can notice, the Porshe is still behind us
They will have to redesign test tracks for the new power of electrics
Blah blah blah looks like a down hill go cart going almost out of control....but can't compare to a screaming combustion engine.in fun and sound
So the Audi RS3 is faster at less than half the price? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_N%C3%BCrburgring_Nordschleife_lap_times
Being able to hear tire squill suggests this was done on road tires or semi slicks because slicks don't scream unless you lose grip so that just crazy
If the hairdrier is capable of producing heat, then heat to energy to heat.
This track was there in nfs shift 2 unleashed
After few corners you hear "Yo what's up" from Bjorn. ☺️
This record could have been even better with a decent race driver, who brakes with left foot and doesn't let roll before the corners.
That hideous steering wheel thooooo
Always have to check if I left the speed on 1.5, but then realize it‘s normal lmao😂
what kind of exhaust is this car using? So silent! :D
How about a FSD trial on the track!
But if this the kinda speed Elon talkin i wonder how the new roadster would pair
It’s like holding a Xbox controller with a nasa jet pack strapped onto your backpack 😅🔥
Lol, I've never seen the Nürburgring in RL or video before, I only driven it a lot on Need for Speed: Shift (2009). Nicely done as it pretty much looks the same as I see it here :) I know which the road by heart as well.
This was amazing
I've driven that course SO MANY times on xbox! lol
Car sounds so good 🔥
I want to say the dyson is on to it with the hairdrier, it just need an aduptation, travel speed may be increase, tiny step's. I do 'nt think i'm talk flight just an edge or lack of one.
It accelerates so fast you can hear the frequency of the exit curbing increase before it ends.
Listen to all that plastic :/
There should be a lighter model with better coilovers, better tires and ceramic brake disks for people who want to race!
is this driver "The Stig"
waiting for nevera
wish it has more downforce to keep high speed cornering, hope it come on a roadster
Would'nt it be simpler to add another cable to the chargeing point for dumping electrical reserve's just add another plug in on thd car's for dumping once their charged by use of a dinamo charger.
The power from like 120km/h to 180km/h in a second or two is WOW!
So replying, their's something there, about air being the sole principal why we have weight, and it driveing me nut's, what my mind is trying to tell me, then their's the thought if you take air from the front of the craft and dispace it to the back, while traveing. I do'nt know i 'm just an idea 's man.
The acceleration sounds so good.
James May must be so impressed.
The yoke makes sense now. You’re hands have to be in perfect racing position.
Corvettes were running 7:19 or less 10 years ago lol
Kurvenperformance wie ein LKW
😮
Just put a bottle in one wheel then it will make sound
Impressive.. however can this be done on auto pilot 😂
tesla fanboys: wait, whats the Nürburgring? i only know about 0 to 60 times, what is this?
*its a family sedan what the hell?*
That sound when accelerating should do the reverse when braking/deccelerating. Even if it was fake. It would be much more immersive
It’s a heavy car as you can see wow and still fast impressive.
What a great noise of the engine
The car looks so unstable and shaky that it makes me wonder what are this guys balls made of  Seriously, someone put decent suspension, bracing, brakes, tyres and rims on this beast and it’s gonna be something
I hope normal driving won't require the driver to shake the wheel like that.  Does Elon intend to use the Yoke to keep the driver awake?
Gave me anxiety just watching.  Not sure if its jerky wheel movement, hearing tire squeal, or lack of engine noise.
That was immense 👍👏😎🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇺🇸🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 damn that thing sounds like a hyper car
"Faster than a Mclaren P1 in Laguna Seca", ok....
Anxiety when he speeds: 100
its fast and all that but i see its extremely twitchy and unsettled!!!!!
Such an amazing piece of engineering.
The amount of correction that the driver has to do in the corners makes me think twice about the handling 🤔
That pathetic steering wheel might be the most stupid idea to put on a road car ever
Man definitely cant wait to see what the roadster can do. The S is a MONSTER and the sound is just soo beautiful
I wonder if autopilot can do a better job
I just want to experience it myself 👏🏻Its State of the art manufacturing ! Masterpiece ! Love it...Tesla will be my first car if I'm able to afford it one day ❤️
😊😊😊😊
Shit build quality
That suuuuuuu sound ❤️😀
That acceleration is fking illegal!
400 hp over an m5 cs and still 6 seconds slower lmfao
He even had time to adjust his helmet LOL
I want this
NICE..NOW PLZ Send me an update to get like 100 more hps out of my model  3 performance, Mileage be DAMMED! I dont want to have to talk the wife into selling her 430i for my M4 with pure turbos. I WANT to keep my 3. It IS amazing But, I like mods, and I NEED more JUUUUIIIICE ELON!!
Awesome
Still slower than a  Porsche 911 GT2 RS or a Mercedes GT Black Series.
Hard to remind yourself that this isn’t a specialized racecar you need to load into a truck for transport once the race is over. Need to get my hands on one.
You forget easily it's a 1K HP car and 5K lbs.  gonna have to drive that tank!
Well done Chauffeur, while you do that Imma be watching netflix in the back or chilling with a video game or two. Let me know when we've arrived.
"stock out of the factory" *has a shit load of measurements devices and a big ass roll cage*
The lap time is not that impressive considering the horsepower it has
I've driven tesla model s in gran turismo 6 and it handled like an old carrot, constant oversteer and it weighs a lot. so i find this impressive
This looks, ans IS blooming fast, but doesn't look fun at all..
Brilliant in a straight line, but it was certainly protesting around the corners 😬
Amazing driving
Stupid steering
Apparently it needs better brakes than this.
Ok it’s fast, but after watching it for 3 minutes i moved on. Jeeez this is boring…
seems battery didn't get overheated. Amazing
What's with all the plastic creaking? It sounds like a GM vehicle
mad props to the driver wow
Being able to hear the tires and seeing the wheel correction is allowing me to realize how hard being a race car driver is. I thought I could do it till I’ve seen this. Also allow people to fix their own cars Tesla. My model y was broken into and it cost me $900 . If I would of know I wouldn’t have bought a Tesla.
U can listen to this audio n go to sleep😴😹
*The Koenigsegg it probably the only gas powered cars right now that can keep up with Tesla; just because of their **_Free-Valve_** technology.* Tesla's are stupid fast... This is drag car stats we are talking about here.
My wife’s SUV is quicker… yawn
Is that the Stig!?
So much creaking
Isn't this the map from Forza??
I finally realise that its "Tesla Model S Plaid" and not "Plaid Tesla Model S"
rather than a gasoline car which is harder to drive this looks soo comfortable
Tesla is not Eco friendly
this run is done with the 165mph limiter on, can't wait to see it without the limiter!!
why am i not subscribed to the official tesla channel
I watched this video in a library
He might have gotten a better lap time if he had a proper steering wheel.
핸들이 뒤지게 불편해보이네요
Sounds like a ship at sea.
Ya, but how fast can "Full Self Driving Stig" put it round the track?
Electric steering looks loose as fuck I feel like he is shaking the steering wheel more than usual
Next: program the track into the autopilot and get a new world record.
It looks like a video game, the speed is unrealistic!!! 👍👍
Das Lenkrad ist sowas von kacke
Car needs more downforce. Perhaps a track edition?
Very fast. Congratulations. 👍  But honestly... Like every ev video it was completely emotionless to watch... Take every slower ice car with engine noise and more engagement to drive.
Sabine would be proud of this run...
Those Gran Turismo video game tire noises were pretty accurate during the Playstation 1 era
This is a real tech sound
This car doesn't have an active aerodynamic right? But the grip of the tyre is insane !
the time score is trash
A Nürburgring run that is so quiet you can hear the cries of EV haters in the distance.
The Mustang GT500 did much better around this track. And he fighting that car like hell. https://youtu.be/30c3mINaONk
sounds like a freaking airline
For just a penny a day, you can support Tesla tires in need. These poor creatures are subjected to immense weight, astronomical G's, and sick acceleration on a daily basis, but you can help. Call the number on your screen to make a donation.
Musk iam waiting for the car to drive in india 👍
2019 1.8L front wheel drive Renault  Mégane does it in 7.40
taking fucking turns at 265.....um ok who cares about the plaid....that driver is a machine
The acceleration just looks bonkers.
that can't be mph, they in Germany so it was km right? lol
I like the roar of the engi.. motors when accelerating eeeeee.  Edit: And the top speed of the tesla s plaid is 269 or 268 idk if it is on mph or kph
The half steering wheel scares the hell out of me. You lose even one hand off the wheel while turning and it’s disaster.
6:59 what's up with the 10/kph speed difference between the 2 screens?
Damn!!!!!
It’s a fricking race car sedan robot roller coaster toy.
holy moly guys take a look at this part 3:25
Those poor, poor tires 🤣
I wonder how a Tesla would stack up in a 24h race 🤔
So it can finish a lap without overheating. Noice.  Also it is fast as RS3 which is probably half the price (if not more). Noice²
7:35 isn't very impressive for a car that has 1000 hp.  The 992 Porsche GT3 did it in 6:59 with 500 hp
for the 0-60 time of this car, I am kinda disappointed. Just goes to show how important handling is.
Amazing tire technology.
This is crazy boring.. Listen to the silence of nothing.
I just turned up my volume to hear the engine 😂
This ain’t a car issa ground ✈️
if only the screen could give you a racing line
Hear nothing 😂
The speed the car gets to in spots where other cars are much slower makes for a different dynamic in many places.  It obviously doesn't corner very fast or have ridiculous Cup 2 R tires that some of the faster Porsches have.
Its'...just...weird. Seeing a car go that fast on a racetrack with no engine noise. Otherworldly.
Impressive how you can hear the tires suffer without a gas engine reving as hell.
*crashes*
Professional race drivers have got to hate this.  Part of the experience is the noise that goes with the drive.  With no engine noise to enhance the audible signal cues as to when to start braking or accelerating per corner, it takes away 1 of the senses that drivers rely on.  It is all part of the "feel" of driving a machine.  There is no argument that fast is fast, but to truly be using all your trained senses to control a machine, audible noises have to be a part of it.
It wouldn’t suprise me if it was Elon himself driving!
I really would like to see the breaking system cause this is the weak point of Electric sports car
Hi Elon!
This guy takes turns at my highway speed.
was the 69 km/h edited intentionally at the end of the video 7:45 😂
In fact, it was a special run training the new NN for the FSD autopilot. From user perspective new FSD mode will be called: "Girlfriend is home alone" 😎
Dude, you must have accidentally toggled engine sound off in the sound settings. And half the texture on the steering wheel is missing!
Yes, sounds like jet cooooool
this is motorcycle like acceleration.
The sound of tyres going to the grave .
How fast do you want to go today.
The beast is in bad need of beefier track tires, that's for sure. Good stuff.
Stunning exhaust sound 😍😍
Handles like a bus but goes like a rocket. We need the roadster!
Is this acceleration for real??? And what is this TV in the car?!
I doubted before, but now I understand that Ilona Mask's companies are indeed the most influential innovative companies in the world, including Tesla.
It’s like playing a video game with bug that broke the engine sound…
Congrats On 2 Million Subscribers!!!!
Pff...... i much prefer the Nissan 200SX on slippy Nürburgring Nordschleife guy and the sound of his machine !!
Just had to watch it again :)
Wow, even without the sound of a combustion engine this is super intense! Maybe even more because of that!
Bing, Bong! Next stop: Bonn.
car would be cool and all if not for that big ass fucking tv inside the car
The 4K footage is great! 60FPS next time ?
I'm getting on throught reply to reply to coment, the whole reason you get heavier when going fast is the body is being bomdarded by air pressure, the faster you move through air the more you push up against it the more weight added.
So TESLA need over 1000HP to beat a Taycan with 760 HP.. But dont worry.. Porsche will fight back in a few weeks with the 2022 Model 😄👋
That Steeringwheel is a JOKE 🤣
Gotta hand that car one thing at least, it's fast at the straights
Man I see how he crashed the first Time, that thing just is not stable at all. It’s a really mad energizer 🐰.
Was this car running Michelin Pilot 4S tires?   Wonder how much faster it would be with Cup 2's?
This was completely stock. Let's see it again with track tires and upgraded brakes!
Now lets do this with prius.
Imagine if they put on racing tires.
Amazing car! Love it 😎😍. Am excited for the Roadster! Aaand I think electric is def. the future! No doubts anymore.                  Sad for Porsche but hey it still laughs in 919 tribute 🙊
So i won't be posting message's on youtube anymore, ps4 did update an know i'm locked out, why because i do'nt have a mobile, this world insane. Pluss while i'm here the earth mass is such that when surrounded by a custion of air that the sheer mass causes electrical conductivity with the tetonic plates causeing friction and the air pocket air which give's the electrifyed layer against the vacuum, the air give use pressure which give's use weight to everything governed by the law's of gravity.
What a powerful car!
This is America. No, this is Germany
very impressive. i would crash running at that speed. especially tesla doesn't make noise. i use my hearing when driving fast. listening to the engine.
Ah the glorious sound of screeching and air. If only Tesla was a super luxury car that'd think to use insolation and special tires to let me not hear that
Tesla used to be something different. Now, Musk has lost it. A YouTuber with a Model S had an issue with the battery pack. It turns out 2 bricks had an issue. 2 out of what? Like over 90? Tesla was going to charge him $22,000+ to replace the battery. $22,000!!!! They were offering him no option to merely replace the faulty bricks. Fortunately he had an independent shop fix the actual problem for about $4000 but that's a joke. This company is just awful now. Musk is all upset about union companies getting benefits non-union companies like Tesla don't. Well Elon, how about allowing unions bud? Want your customers to get the benefits then do what it takes to make it happen. So disappointed in what this man has done to a once great company.
Why don't you build a car that automatically recharges itself when it's running🙄
Sound like fucking train 🚅♥️
This looks terrifying!😄
Watching this 1am in the morning I fell asleep!!!
At the corners of Nürburgring, I would really prefer manual control over the gears rather than the regenerative breaks on Tesla. Ignoring the fact that how much environment friendly can be electric. And the sound is ear-rape tbh, idk how people are liking that awkward sound
still almost a minute slower than a production porsche lol
Not exactly smooth but quick none the less. I can't wait to see what they do with a better set of track tires and the extra Aero package.
Such a shame Sabine never had a chance to take this round
Who drives ?
Whats wrong with a normal steering wheel?
cool
FML this is at best a lethargic barely energised pig. THE UNDERSTEER
Dislikes are from Porsche's multiple accounts
I thought the stig got to choose his own music? 🤷‍♂️ 🎶 🎵
if they say this is a sim without a speaker I would also believe it
Elon bro i know you since no one knows you belive me!!!!!!! i said BELIVE!!!!!!!!!!* aaaaa give me tesla i dont have any car Hehe boiii ok listen you give me tesla and i will tell you co2 removal formula belive me if you dont you gonnna never achieve it or i well to jeff you mean jeff who the richest person lol  😂
This should be retitled: How to over steer a car. Dude was way too much input
That's an OK lap time.  But for not being a sports car, not bad.
Bro they need to add this car to gran turismo
Phantastic
The way it handled at 3:55 proves it has loads of control. I can imagine any other car would've lost more control .
So much work to driver -this bullet unstable on corners. True american
*I have about 5% of my portfolio in uranium stock any advice on any other stock that I can grow my $300k capital to a million dollars?*
Inside voice “where is the rest of my steering wheel!”
Honestly, for a car THAT powerful, you really need carbon ceramic brakes if you’re going to be taking to the track like that.
Tesla: why does your software updates messes up my car everytime. I already have my laptop and phone to deal with this kind of headache😑
Did anybody else notice a "crack" sound around 1:20 or so?
All i can say is i feel bad for the tyres XD
I just want to see a lightweight tesla. I don’t care if it’s not the fastest in a straight line, faster cornering is more fun
It’s the same time as the M5 Competition. What the m5 looses in acceleration, it gains back in cornering speed.
Whos the driver???
god the interior creaks so much when it turns lmao
Everyone saying how loud the tires are because of the weight of the batteries, I agree but, I think it’s from the absence of engine noise that makes them seem louder.
Hm, it’s much slower than amg gt 63s and panamera turbo s
Amazing! The torque vectoring system is very well tuned, despite all the squealing, the car just follows the steering direction without shaving too much speed during cornering.
Extremely impressive but I'd definitely feel better if it had a regular steering wheel
I would like my Tesla Plaid to be right handed and non yoke steering..
every turn is one where he narrowly avoids certain death
I really felt scared in the ring
some people think they are this guy on the streets lmao
Ladies this is how we drive to get to you when you tell us your in the mood
Thats not bad for a family car,Amazing job...7:35 it's a good time
That’s a heavy ass car
I would love to see the wheels and brake shoes after the race ended.
quick in a straight line thats it. slow af around the corners
Cool as this is, I love street racing more.  The plaid will destroy the quarter mile.
After watching this the highest speed I seen was 267kmh which translates around 164 mph. I thinking it still has the 163 mph limiter on this car. This it’s power and acceleration it should have been well over 300 kph on that final straight.
Интересно это Tesla так скрипит???
This is only the model s….all I have too say for.
M5.  Comp Eats your lunch
Now I want to see Autopilot do the same thing. That would be amazing. (It has to have the red 'Knight Rider' lights though or it doesn't count)
No one is mentioning the fact that it uses  37% battery on ONE lap.  It problably wouldn't even do two full laps on full power. Insane speed? Maybe. But usable as a track car? No.
Pretty impressive. Though it looked like it was pulling power significantly towards the end on the main straight.
That is how a zero fun car looks like when you place it on the track. Really, it's a great street car for comfort and acceleration  , but it's zero enjoyment for people who actually like to drive.
Fast but no emotions.
What a drive! Without the engine noise, the driver can concentrate on what the tires / suspension are saying. Can a full minute be removed with a track prepped Tesla? The future for us car guys is looking bright! Thank you Tesla!
Very strong acceleration. abit too noisy but the the acceleration sound is good. Tyre should be improved and the wheel needs more area to grip. also this car needs to reach 300kmH. but overall very cool footage.
Checkout the crack on the windscreen.  interesting.
Like riding in a radio controlled car! But warp speed.
How many laps on one charge ?
It's literally like a video game.
Needs better tires
stock??
Y yo subiendo el volumen porque no escuchaba nada ...
love the Tuuuuuuu, Vrooooom so old school
DAMN THIS SOUNDS LIKE A FREAKING DELOREAN ! I love my boss.
It looks very hard to drive in the limit, and do not reach an impressive top speed. It's all about acceleration.
what have you done with randy? Bring him back now lol
Could anyone apply sound of a Corvette LS7 on this?
Btw is this a record?
Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 did it at least 6 seconds better
Press F to pay respect to the tires
Should have used THE STIG.
Now I wonder how autopilot would do on this? would it be faster?
missing prappap papp pappp - turbo lag
we do have to remember the reason why you notice the tyres making so much noise compared to other Nurburgring runs is because there is no engine noise drawing it out
That steering was really a bad decision!! 🤨
How many watched from beginning to end?
But a half powered GTR do better.
1:19 whew, car almost flew away :D
저 조가튼 핸들로도 기록이 어마무시하네
Who was the driver?
That's not a quick lap for the power it has, is it? Didn't the old 2009 GTR do a 7:32 with only 450bhp back in 2009 ? The Porsche cayenne turbo truck is 2 seconds faster than this at 2.2 tons and 600bhp... let that sink in.
The interior is squealing like a pig on the way to the butcher.
That time would even be better with sabine behind the wheel R.I.P. racequeen.
That's not made for track, it's super slow for that power. That's a time for a 300hp Hyundai / Renault / Honda. It's fast only in straight lines, and that's all about this car
For a production EV it is indeed pretty impressive. Congrats to Tesla and driver, great job!
OH MY GAAAAWD !  That was terrifying to watch.  How does anybody need a car that fast in RL?
Car feels really heavy. Too much understeer.
Good time ?
Rectangular wheel? Hard PASS.
Is it  just me or does the car seem really understeery? The driver had to correct his angle at least 3 times per corner
Beatifull ronco kkkk
Haha top speed of over 200mph my arse. Still beat the taycan fair and square though!
id think its a professional driver. Needs to work on his/her turns, seems like starting to turn a second or two too soon.  if he/she is wearing glasses maybe have their vision checked again, may need different prescription.
Tesla your car is very cool👏🏻[claps]
Please remember this is a family car, alot of these comments seem to be comapring/expecting it to be a fully fledge racecar, it's a family sedan/saloon and it can do that.
Were tesla engineers driving the vehicle with a D-pad during development? Car looks like an absolute stress-fest to try and drive at the limit. No poise whatsoever, just vagueness through the goofy yoke and tons of acceleration.
Fast as fuck boi
7:01 268kph
Honestly the time is not that impressive considering the immense amount of power of the plaid
Porsche Taycan is smashed
Is this the first American car with decent handling and cornering? Now make it beautiful as muricans knew how to make them back in the day 1950-1975.
spaceship
Pretty amazing it was able to beat taycan which is more of a track car than model s
Like walking a fast elephant around the track...
The siclent lovers like Tesla cars
Motorsports videos are best with no music.  Thanks
#ElonMusk #TESLARacing #TESLA  RACE With  #AI  No Humans  Onboard    Call Or Text Anytime
No engine sound only tyre rubbing 😂😂😂
I wanna know how many batteries you have left after finish?
He would’ve gone faster if he had a proper steering wheel to hold onto.
Legends watch it in 2x speed
One of the most thrilling vibe ever.. tesla plaid in india will unlocks certain features.
Lucid Motors can do better 😏
No roar of engine - no fun
Porsche is the best! 💪 Face to face race with the Porsche!!!!
Talk about tire scrub!
Why are there two speedometer at different speed?
haha is the windshield broken?
特斯拉超帥！希望是能改變特斯拉板金外觀，這車子的造型用好久了ＸＤ 看膩了。
imagine riding in this - "oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shito shtishtishithsihtishtis"
Pro driver not included  Also battery goes bye-bye
Tesla 7m35 s Porsche Taycan 7m42s !!!! Pay me for the clocking Tesla !!!
F1 car: am I a joke to you?
Teslas are true "kill all tires" type of cars. #hoonigan
0% Introduction 0% meaningless speech 0% waste of time 100% Model S Plaid at Nürburgring
How much does it cost to replace the batteries ?
Edmunds was right about the yoke. Guy would have been a minute quicker with his hands at the 10 and 2.
Yoke wheel is a disaster! It’s going to cost lives….. What were they thinking! They should make it optional!
2X speed yw
The car feels very unsafe at high speed... Was also in reduced power mode before the lap was completed, it struggled to reach 260kph on the last straight vs how it does when in full power. Also no way the brakes were stock. Race fluids and race pads minimum. Stock brakes struggle after one big stop from 160mph...Plus rollcage and bucket seat. Not bashing Tesla, I own one, but seriously the car looks like it is a handful, its moving left right all the time. Steering may be to direct for high speed and suspension not meant for the Nurburgring. Of course the car will be faster on CUP2/CUP2R and ceramic brakes, but looks like battery cooling will need mods, and so the suspensions... But after all, it is still a 4700 pounds car, difficult to fight the law of physics...
that was nuts to watch, he's basically drifting every corner as the tires are barely able to hold traction, he could lose control at any moment, or is that just the normal sound tires make when going around corners at high speeds in an ice vehicle we just can't hear them over the engine
RIP tires.
That's a pretty good time for the weight this car has to throw around. I wonder if they're running carbon ceramic brakes?
beauty of V0 engine..lol
Wow.    Impressive driving.    What a handful
It was speed limited to 269kmph... their needs to be an optional tire that is a track tire forged light wheel package... TESLA needs to work directly with Unplugged to offer on their site the Roush/Shelby type of marketing... Some like it hot and from the factory.  Since they are not offering a Plaid+  offer an Unplugged option that does what the 10% of people want which is a supercar/porsche killer... with a 322km speed rating... Unplugged can work with the tire providers to offer the best tire for the mass, etc.
Tesla should call the 25k car the Tesla DAB
Over a thousand HP and the new M5 CS, Alfa QV, and Jaguar project 8 is still faster and almost half the hp. It’s only few seconds faster than a civic type R with 300 HP.  The main problem…..WEIGHT and real motorsports experience. But it’s not bad since it’s an EV(compromised in motorsports applications).
Leave it to the Germans to build the greatest paved race course ever produced by man.  At least we in the great northwest have Washougal Motocross!
Is this KM or Miles per hour?
The steering looks & feels so light
even porsche taycan 2nd gear cant beat teslas rotor
Tesla´s speedo might be a bit optimistic
I want to see Vin Diesel in this for the next Fast movie.
La estabilidad😳
GT2 RS owners: it’s okay, you’ll be okay.
Doesn’t seem to have the handling to match the speed
That car should be illegal everywhere!!!
yall need better tires
That leaves a lot of room of improvement for a Model S Plaid RS
Good time... Now with proper sound and less power and weight... Enjoy https://youtu.be/5gEdJmIVqLY
congrats Elon and Tesla History in the making
Outstanding performance
So basically, the race sport is dead in a couple years when people start racing in this?
Please also let Misha test one !
269 mph - wow! incredible! a new era for the automotive industry.
Lift off Lauda left kink. Stock tires. REALLY? Amazing driving, great lap time. I love it!
After that lap, the tires went out for a cigarette... LOL
The cajones on this guy. There are no resets.
Why is the steering wheel not a wheel shape?
Fast but still a toy car
We need an adjustable force-feedback on the Tesla steering. That's all.
WOW! I am now dizzy as hell! My eyeballs are still traveling!
Respekt 👍👍👍
how my mom thinks I drive:
It topped out only 268 kmph on last long straight
Get Leh Keen to do it in the rain now: https://youtu.be/WAvN0EzEacU
Our grand children will never know the musical orchestra of dancing pistons
First time I feel asleep watching a Nurburg lap
epitomy of EVs
I dont know why people love the tesla so much yes its fast but im hearing an annoying high pitched sound. Instead of a gas powered engine roaring.
Wow this is like when I tested my new Coil Raiden in GTA
There is a reason why there is too much tyre noise in Gran Turismo, because it's real lol
still don't like tesla...
One of the best Drivers driving one of the Craziest Cars, on a legendary track. And this is the outcome. Phenomenal.
So the yolk steering wheel is ok for reguler use 🤔
Maybe in a near feature, Telsa can take us into F1-Autopilot mode.
This is me leaving at 8:15 trying to get to work by 8
Wow going like a rocket!
The Yoke Whisperer ...
OMG ....Scheiß die Wand an....
All Stock.. Elon is a God
In the straight road he is using the accelerate in turning he is not using it. But accelerating sound is good
I think the wheel… yoke is goofy and I wouldn’t care to have it in everyday traffic but to each their own
Knight rider in the daytime
is that km or miless?
This is like a hyper realistic video game 🎮 🕹 🤣!!!!
Looks like a scene from need for speed hot pursuit. Ahh I loved that game as a child. Never imagined electric car to come this far.
Rimac Nevera is fastest production car!
That's it! I don't like having no noise coming out when accelerating, this car has the perfect sound lol
Durch das fehlen eines Motorengebrülles  ist der Innenraum auf einmal überdeutlich zu hören. Das leichte Knarzen klingt erinnert mich an einen Schaukelstuhl. Dann wieder Blick auf die Strecke.Ach du Sch….!  Super gefahren.Absurd schnell.
Wow that's amazing ❤️. Satisfying to watch. Like a puzzle. But that steering wheel must have been uncomfortable though.
Still no emotions...
Mit 180 in die Kurve 😅
awesome
this game looks amazing
Can't wait to see Autopilot do this.
this car is like game car which increase numbers on the speedometer when we press gas lol
Am I crazy , but around 7:13 of this vid , the read out for kph on the 2 screens behind the yolk are reading more than 10kph difference in speed. any idea why this is happening ?
Why show both speedometer diffrents speeds?
Thats like a c8 corvette.
To see a car tearing up a track like that with just the sound of the tires fighting the pavement is surreal.
Does it use custom breaks?
cool
Great run, but that was one of the most sketchiest drives I have ever seen.  It felt very uncomfortable with the car moving all around and tires sounding like sponge bob mounted them :).
Very impressive to think it’s on Pilot Sport 4S tires, standard brake setup, and I’m summing a limited top speed of what 163 mph?  If Tesla’s really does come out with a Track Package with Cup 2 tires, perhaps ceramic Brembos, maybe wider rims plus flares on the fenders, along with unlocking the top speed, and an upgrades suspension setup, I would think it could drop 15-20 seconds quite easily.  And if it could be delivered for or under $150k US, then it would truly be the most usable insane vehicle on the planet.
I used to think you couldn't beat the sound of an engine, but that nonchalant sort of whine/whistle the car makes when it's accelerating full tilt sounds like a spaceship and makes me want to buy 12
Initially i was loving the footage but there was something disturbing me unconsciously. Then I looked at the steering and poor driver is struggling to rotate that thing... I got it.. sigh
Amazing - would LOVE to see how fast FSD can do this.  Pre-program the track, optimize everything, and let it rip.
that rumbling of the airframe... what a sortie.
tops out @270k ... with 1000hp lol
Nordschleife*
Big splat at 3:36
Very capable car, but please switch these 4S tires for Cup2, there is so much to gain with good track tires
It’s embarrassing how bad this thing handles. I mean, the guy was even afraid to go flat out on some straight sections. Heh. I still want one. But, man, if only they didn’t need to weigh ninety million kg.
Incredible!
10 minutes fun, then the battery is dead :P Great fun none the less 😊
so when can I take a seat on the passenger side and let the autopilot rip?
Want to see CyberTruck on this track!
The Plaid on uphill sections; hills do not exist.
Least energy used to to lap the Ring at record speed. If the Plaid and the Porsche lapped the ring  at full speed until their batteries ran down, the Plaid would make one full lap more than the Porsche and complete at the same time.
woow this creaking is terrifying. typical american build quality.
1 mil views
For all that power and a 7:35 this just proves the Tesla Plaid is no track car,  My Quadrifoglio sedan ran a 7:32 there and the Tesla has 1020 HP to the Alfa Romeo's  505HP. Once they can get these electric cars to handle like Porsche is doing all  gas supercars will be left in the dust though.
The yolk “wheel” looks terrifying, has to keep micro adjusting it since it’s center of gravity is off. At high speeds that’s really scary. Looks like it’s hard to hold in a turning position. I’m all for progress but not sure this is it. wish they had a standard wheel option for this sucker. Rest of the car is perfect 👍
Absolutely incredible.
Yes it looks impressive. However, somebody down the comments mentioned the lap record driven in a Porsche 919 Hybrid Evo and yes, a comparison is unfair. But look at this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQmSUHhP3ug This is outright insane and brutal.
Does anyone know who the driver is?
its the acceleration out of the turns. the tires must be bald after 1 lap
The steering wheel handling looks very choppy compared to the Porsche Taycan.
Accelleration is insane... bye bye other supercars...
У нас в Геленджике на серпантинах газелисты бодрее ездят.
Doesn’t it go 0 to 60 in .9 seconds
….what’s the point of having a screen on top of a screen?🤔
Windglass has got already a crack, which means a lack of structural stiffness, the whole saloon is full of side noices, everything rattles.  If it's unmodified, why the side windows are tinted and what's that black shiny bar on the left door?
Slower than m5, slower than mercedes gt63s, slower than panamera, all of these cars have 300-400hp less.. just tesla things.
i dont care about the time a car does on NÜR when the car has 1 inch panel gaps and things falling off.
Even with 1000hp+ this is way slower as a 911 Turbo S🤔
My gosh that was flat out on every corner and straights 😱
Tesla: Soon you will get Nurburgring autopilot update.
damn i want one!~!!!
Racers don't complain about the steering wheel
Oh my it's fast
This guy was sweating😂.
Please lobby to increase speed limit on highways. Where do i even drive these fast cars.
The lap time is suprisingly longer than the Panamera Turbo S (7m and 29s). The Model S did it in 7m and 35s in comparison.
No telemetry or time given....really??
Ja, aber die Spaltmaße !
Naked Ass!!!!! Thats quick, even from my armchair.. Always seems slow looking from here, but THAT WAS QUICK.
The weight is really really noticeable.
And that was his first practice lap, and using only standard road tyres!!!
#268 is #MAX #SPEED...
I always loved the sound of V8's....oh wait :O
I was like why the tf does it sound so weird... then realized the tires noisy asf cause there not engine sounds
Please tesla can you bring teslas to Tanzania
Model S Plaid 1020hp vs Taycan 616hp. We know how this ends. Porsche upgrades to 1000hp, moves record to 7:20ish
Такая машина Приору догонит?
Un régal à regarder et.....à entendre. Bravo au pilote qui tire le meilleur de l'auto
if the track is 20.8km long then 7:35 looks like an Average of 165kph or nearly 102mph   which is pretty good considering a number of 60-80kph tight turns there - eep !  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%BCrburgring
Samir did't break the car this time!
Гремит как ВАЗ на кочках))
Looks frantic in there
It would have been funny if at the end the driver took off his helmet and then you could see that Elon Musk had set the lap time.
Who was the driver? Awesome driving skills.
imagine that you are sitting in the passenger seat .... :D
I think the handling of the car could be a lot better, because it seems that the driver is fighting with sa wheel. Nevertheless what a great lap it was from tesla and their driver.
View is boring
i wonder how good of a time an AI could do. @elonmusk can you please?
cant wait to drive this in Forza
First time I got to see the real thing, and what a treat! Played it so much in Forza I felt like I was ghost riding. Very cool to see the accuracy of the Game, and Driver!
The two speedometers do not seem to agree with each other at high speed (at 7:17 front one says 258 while the stock one is 271).
Wow, you can really hear the tires screeching and fighting to keep the heavy ass car stay on track. The driver is impressive too, great lap time even without ceramic brakes, spoilers and other goodies.
Lol what? Tesla’s can drift??
You can play this video with or without sound
I think MKBHD did this trial in his video, if I'm correct
imagine this when wife says buy some groceries and cook after
I guess in the practice run, they cracked the windshield.
He never went above 300 km/h I think. Acceleration between turns made the record.
Poor tires
Average speed of 102 mph
You couldn’t fall off a cliff faster then that.
Nice moded Model S plaid
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Too much weight
This seems so fun and exhausting at the same time.
อย่างเเรง
The most boring sounding lap of the Nurburgring ever
The Beach Bonanza V Tail became known as a  "Doctor Killer". The Tesla Plaid may become known as a "Nerd Killer".
this model goes on sale with the description „slightly used“ 😂😂
What a pig… it is painful to watch LOL! It needs 305s upfront and 355s in the back Cup 2Rs , 16 inch CCB. It then should finally beat the Jaguar 7:21 record.
Impressive driving! You can definitely tell it's a heavy car on a track like this. But the performance is impressive non the less.
Questo si che sa guidare ! #respect
This time is barely faster than a Camaro, that's a kind of disappointing lap time..
Those corners are pretty normal looking…  But the beginning of those straight, oh my. It’s like having a boost button from a video game.
Holy shit!  The whole time I thought well here comes the loss of control and spectacular crash
Alternate Title: *THIS IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE WHEN TIRES GO TO HELL*
Their are constant's in the universe, pressure is one, in fact most thing's come down to it, a water molecular is is constantly taken apart and put back together, all due to pressure it in every thing from how we developed to how the universe work's, planet's with atmosphere start of how, it all pressure, pressure that we call gravity, atmospheric pressure that hold's you to the large object, a cushion of pressurised air held in place, Holding us down, pressure.
Like a Video game simulator
The whole Einstein's theory of relotivity is inhansed by the gravity is just a buy-product of atmospheric pressure.
Autopilot is driving, he has just his hands on the wheel.
geez thats so slow holy cow
Driver looks fighting to keep the car on track. Great power and low maneuverability.
I love Tesla  The cornering does not look very good, also the steering wheel inputs do not look very good, Compared with e.g. GT3 or GT3RS which I am used to.  On wiki Plaid has recorded time in between (roughly same as ) Audi RS3 and BMW M5.
This is how it sits in the table  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_N%C3%BCrburgring_Nordschleife_lap_times  Closely matched between BMW M5 and Audi RS3
Literally every Tesla driver on their way to work
That steering wheel has to go it’s not ideal for aggressive driving and it sounds like the night 2000 in there !
Wow, that's a cool sounding car... I mean, they had a good lap on that type of tyres  Still, in the longest straight I'm really confused looking at both the screens speed: Why is there something like 10 km/h of difference between them?
Devastating
Terrified all the way through that thinking if he goes for a different grip on that wheel he's bolloxed :-) .
BORING!
Stable or Unstable?
The finish line is really just the end of his morning commute…
That was painful to watch ⌚ 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️😂
3:38 Ball of Steel Mode ON
Saw a video with title : Lap at Nurburgring   Turn up the volume.  Wait a minute…… realise it was a Tesla 😅
One minute behind the fastest car... but okay 🤔
Warum fährt er nicht schneller als 268kmh? Das muss doch bis 320kmh gehen ohne Begrenzer🤔?
Excited to see the difference in time with the tires, brakes, suspension and removal of the interior weight.
Awesome!!!!
R.I.P  tires 🤗
So after this aggressive attack how many percent of the battery is remaining?
Wouldn't it be amazing if tesla did a driverless lap record, could be the first one to ever do it.
Vrooooom stutututu vrooooom pop bang pop bang
AI controls this. All field routes are processed against the vehicle's capabilities. in relation to the speed at which the car will be able to do the maximum Let the speed of each phase do as much as it can be released.
Are those miles per hour or kilometers per hour?
Well now this is all I need nothing more
hopefully, this teaches them faster car needs more grip than power. barely faster than a civic lol
slowwwwwww
how much battery did he use :)
Is this video of a Tesla test run or of my wife trying to get to work on time?
I wonder how much battery did it use?
오~ 핸들이 반바퀴이상 안돌아도 왠만한 코노는 다 도는군~~ 아하~
I'm impressed by how stable the screen is in any situation. The inside of this car feels monolithic.
Would love to know if the factory car is speed restricted with software (due to tyres maybe)? Plaid appears to "top out" around 265kph on the long straight whereas the Tesla specification for top speed is 322kph. I would have thought it could have pulled beyond 265 on the long straight if top speed is 322. Tesla?
Tesla 1 full charge can handles Le Mans race.?
To feel the real thrill watch it in 1.25x  It's insane.
That thing reaches 200km/h preetttyyy damn fast. I could tell the driver was holding off a bit in some high-speed sections because well... he doesn't want to die! :P  That was nuts.
Why there is so big difference with speed odo? Cars own shows 279 and the external 268!
Hell no
Pictures showing among others a different steering wheel were fake ?
How many consecutive laps ?
Have tachometer ?
Funny how Edmunds tried to crap on this car whining and complaining about the yoke or the turn signals. Their like CNN now. Tesla is doing a great job redefining the next generation of car. The car continues to get better over time and 99 percent of cars out there will have to talk to your license plate as there is no catching this thing unless you’re spending millions! Think about that this car is a bargain.
watch it in 2x lol
Normally... race video.. take the music down. This one.. add music plz
Пойдёт👍🏻💪🏻Надо Брать!!!
Don't get me wrong, I really appreciate the engineering behind the tesla and the innovation due to their pressure on the market BUT please have a look at the Porsche 919 Hybrid Evo footage. I miss the sound and the insanity :D
I'm shitting in my pants looking at this!
Holyy shit the peed
Goku is still faster 😂😂
I can guarantee you the driver hates that steering wheel :D
Time please
That steering wheel shheeessshhh
This new Forza Game graphics looks so real!!
this car need some serious rubber, i.e. semislicks.
My God, its so heavy!
💯🇨🇴🇮🇱🇨🇴💯
Now let the computer do it.
Lost performance by overheating?
James May has left the chat...
I mean... I'm sorry but 7:35 isn't actually very quick. That's the same as Audi A3
Now translate that telemetry to autopilot and have the car drive the lap 😘
The gearing system on a wind turbine may be useful for the dinamo generator, week's ago but was'nt sure on the thought, invert the rotation just jumped in my head, i do know why, missing voice's.
I bet he started with 20% remaining battery capacity to reduce maximum weight.
so quiet
To Elon Musk from india,  Please launch Tesla in India . Mr.Narendra Modi is saying that we should assemble Tesla in india because it's profitable for you and our country . See when you sell Tesla in india you will get money and if you also make Tesla in india our people could get a job in Tesla factory and feed their families . So please please please please please please please please please please please please launch Tesla in India 🇮🇳. I love Tesla
Show us the battery percent throughout the vid.... you won't ;)
you gotta do it with jeans, short sleeves, and a rolex.  and you still need to go faster.  https://youtu.be/5gEdJmIVqLY
so much lift and coast, running out of breaks?
My heart:1 million beats every second
Love Tesla!! 🌍 💙💚
Yeah, impressive time already for a family sedan EV!
There is a downside that, if fulfilled, could make the car a more comfortable vehicle
Miles per hr or km per hour on the dashboard?
Finally Gran Turismo will have good collision physics
Its not made for this at all but i like it
Electric motorsports = boring motorsports
It‘s too heavy and will always be
"How many times did you almost die? - Yes."
The yoke steering still sucks
It’s been long since I enjoyed a video this much
Car’s so quiet you can hear the driver’s farts.
Did you say family sedan?
That guy takes sharp curves faster than I like to drive in the highway.... scary but coooool!!
Fastest production electric car on nurburgring so far lmao plaid doesnt have this title for long the rimac nevara is here to steal the title and then the tesla roadster
They changed the Dif Ratio so in my Opinion this is Cheating because its not anymore a Production EV
速すぎて離陸しそう！ このコースをこの形のステアリングでかっ飛ばすのもすごい！
With 400Hp more than the Porsche with 5 Seconds Wow XD
Very good tires!!
damn that car is sliding
Why didn't you release the Plaid + ?...  :(
It's just a matter of seconds to see it accelerating from 100 to 200. The fun part is you don't even notice it without looking at the speedometer.
I rly wonder where the 321km/h top speed claim went at the Tiergarten sector😂
I wonder which speedometer was correct... Tesla's or racer's.
Still, the interior sound is as loud as my 15 y.o gas car. You should've used softer plastics... Not that I have the money to buy (there is no Tesla imported to my country either)!!
How cool this
Lol nobody is talking about how he’s not going more than 90 degrees on the wheel? obviously yoke wheel is not a problem, this is ideal scenario. Try parking, city driving, quick slip handling. Respect to driver, great lap.
It needs an hour pit stop
What a hateful car, it whines more than the wife, it rattles more than my mondeo, a big hideous screen and what is that steering wheel about?
You should play some Friends on that tv.
The Plaid is absolutely perfect, beautiful and Amazing..!!
fastest production car of its class
Helal olsun şöförde iyi kullanmış. teslayı tebrik ediyorum 🙏👏
What a roller coaster of a ride, what's top speed of these bad sunnys?
I love this singing of the hybrid synchronous motors. There is simply no substitute for high motor speeds.......
Those poor tires!
I dont think the cockpit and expecially the steering wheel are "stock"...
its Kph not miles per hour, folks....................
Nürburgring lap times are IRRELEVANT
Wow I almost got car sick. Amazing speed! Congratulations to the record!
You can feel the weight of the car through the whole video!
Man that is fast!
Who was driving?
A paid race driver obviously struggles to keep this 130.000$ and 2 tons on the road and does only 7:36, also empty trak. Not amazed at all, considering the price and paid driving. Meanwhile local village poeple do 7:50 in a Golf R or 8:10 with a i30N, which cost 4-5 times less and can do tracking all day long. This Plaid S would just fall apart after a couple of 10.000km, because of the weight, even the tyres would be dead after 2-3 laps and battery would last only 2 laps. You can take a Tesla on the Nürburgring for a lap, but not for a whole day and drive home. But it is a good E-Peni-s extender while drag racing on public roads.
The tyre noise sounds like it has been badly dubbed on afterwards 😂
Looks like the only thing holding this beast back is that tyre technology hasn't caught up yet....
Just wow 🤩 for the skills of the driver as for the Tesla. Just wow 🤩😍
😍😍😍
the track is not suited for a car with so much understeering
The quickest grocery getter!
Waiting for the day when FSD will become capable enough to beat this track on its own
The real “envy” shouldn’t be the riches of this world but the envy of those resting in a peaceful afterlife.
this video makes me fall asleep. the tyre and brakes are the only noisy parts
Когда наезжает на ограничители, то звук подвески и отбой, как на убитом тазике)))
Spends most of its time coasting with all that power. Point shoot , roll to next corner.
That steering wheel will cause a wreck!
Mediocre lap time for all the hype
モーターのｽｳｳｳｳ…って音が良すぎる かっこよすぎる Tesla万歳
does Tesla has auto Drift feature
I highly recommend putting some jazzy elevator music on low in the background while you watch.
Could have knocked off 10 seconds if it had a steering wheel
How this car gains speed is simply insane.
260 KM 👏
LAVATRICE
People are setting off to debunk this already idk
Impressive but terrifying. The speed between the corners is insane. The corners look... uncomfortable. Such a heavy car.
Who's the driver?  Wait, broaaahhh..Kimi has "covid", right...
Awesome car control!
They really need to get the weight down... a 2018 Camaro ZL1 got 7:16... with an "ancient" stick shift manual transmission. Zr1 and Zo6 Vettes are making it at 7:10... The new C8 is even faster is my understanding and its doing it with less than 500 hp. Where the hell is the Tesla roadster?
time to xray that car frame now
Doc and Marty are back in the DeLorean and they tell the fastest car around The Ring is Roadster 2 SpaceX Pack [Flux Capacitor will be removed during Scrutineering in 2023]
yeah nothing special  the enjoyment is in the 0-60, not the handling/track performance
Need this drive train in a McClaren or Lotus
I'm assuming this run was on his way to the grocery store to get milk... Unbelievable family car.
I keep watching this and day dreaming about being rich.
Tesla ! made for the woke ..
Samir you are breaking the car!
Geez, that's looks like an overpowered wheelbarrow.
Just realized that 🌎world has really changed I'm watch an electric sedan do this on a race track wow
Can't wait for the Roadster
It looks like it was all about managing tires and brakes with all that weight 😬!
this car can go much much faster
Why don’t you show it with the auto pilot? That’s the competition I wanna see at Nurenberg. Autonomous time trials.
Did anyone else notice the drivers side base of the windshield crack?
Kudos to the driver and wow what a machine
Can you hear cd rom drive picking up speed?
I wonder how the MadMax pedal-to-the-metal FSD would do.
What was the battery % at the end?
Car can't keep up with the power it delivers. Especially in the corners. This is promising. Why ? Now just imagine what times will be achieved with upcoming electric cars that will have new light battery technology in combination with tremendous power and torque. I wouldn't be surprised if at the end of this decade we will see electric car beating all time record that was set by 919.
The screeching wheels telling me that the car brakes can't break fast while steering. It's a good thing that it's fast, but it's also a good thing to show the audience the improvements.
Is it over steering or just because you never here the tires squeal in a loud race car
That is one fast iPad. Next version the driver will swipe left/right to confirm the turn and the one thereafter won’t need a driver.
For reference the next fastest production 4-door is the Honda Civic Type R at 7:43:80. And the fastest ever race car is a hybrid at 5:19 made by Porsche.
is this in miles or kilometers/hour??
6:44 max speed reached... Awesome!!!
Accelerations sound like iron man pulsars!! So cool
👍 OK great! Now put it on self drive and see if it can beat your lap.
👍🏽👍🏽👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
The parasite noises ... Typical american car
This driver have balls of steel! No aero on this car but still going that fast trough the corners. I wonder how often he jumped.
Amazing , congrats ! 🍾 wow ! That’s Dope
Incredible car!  But I would hate to drive with that steering wheel ! Otherwise it's perfect
Sounds powerful
Wow - over 1000 hp and a C8 corvette and a BMW M4 both with less than 500 hp can bear it around the ring.  I am not impressed.
Roller coaster 🎢
Quick comparison: The same lap time can be driven by an amateur in a Porsche Turbo with only one hand while holding a coffee mug in the other.   It was just awful to watch this.   This has nothing whatsoever to do with driving dynamics. Tesla should be aware of this fact, it would have more dignity.    It all feels like Tesla is trying to turn a hippopotamus into a racehorse, despite all the laws of physics, and no one dares to intervene to stop this nonsense.
That time is absolutely pathetic for a car with that acceleration, jesus fucking christ what a one trick pony.
Pro tip: Show feedback from the speedometer and Forwards / backwards / sideways accelerometers on the screen.
Balls 2 the wall 🇺🇸 do it fur Dale!!
Any hatchback 3 times slower is more exciting than this horseshit on wheels.
congrats on lying to the public.  the car that set the record had carbon brakes, PORSCHE calipers and a NORMAL steering wheel, oh and the car that set the record was RED AND NOT FUCKING BLACK
Man you can hear the sheer weight of the vehicle with every turn! The driver did great keeping her on the track. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
From 94% of battery charge to 57% on less than 8 minutes...it is also a new record ?
That moment you realise that they're probably collecting all of the driving data and feeding it into a future (non-production) version of FSD. That will be FSD's marketing video.
Elon if you see this please make a phone just for the lols
damn i love mario kart
На 12 секунд быстрее , лишь потому что эта ракета ускоряется быстрее чем порш.
Tiko be le fahanginana, le decceleration am le virage 3 farany no tena mahavarina
Such weight :(
What a nice car ❤🧡👌👌
Я тупо зря потратил время на этот просмотр!!!
Dont be modest Tesla, you can include in the details that you beat the Taycan by 12 sec ;)
😂
😳
😍
❤️
When you will have FSD drive on a track?
Вы б водителю руль хотя бы нормальный дали!
The Yoke steering Yocks!
Can it do this autonomously?
Fake
2250 HP more than an electric locomotive!
killer congrats!
Wow
КРЕПКИЙ КУЗОВ , НАГРУЗКУ ТАКУЮ ВЫДЕРЖАЛ
45%= 20km bat is to low
Tesla is the king of smashing records
omg this looks so dangerous, you the the car is at its physical limits…
COOL 🚘
Quiet lap but great lap 😄
Why is steering so jerky?
Plaid model s is like a literal rocket ship on wheels
Give him a steering wheel and he will be much faster.
A Giulia with less than half the power, and RWD is 3 seconds faster. A Panamera which weighs the same dusted this record by 6 seconds with "just" 620 hp. This record is not at all impressive.
Nice
For context these are just some of the cars that the Model S Plaid is faster than at the Nürburgring: BMW M5 (F90)  Nissan GT-R (R35)  Porsche 911 Carrera S Ferrari 458 Italia Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera LP570-4 Lamborghini Murcielago LP640 Audi R8 Coupé 5.2 FSI quattro  Mind-blowing
7:30 mins was the fastest ever recorded on this car. Imagine other cars completing at 1min faster,... Damn
How many times can it go around a track before needing recharged most tracks don't have superchargers right next to them so you race for what an hour and then you need to charge for 14 I've never seen a supercharger in my life
Seeing that speed on the readout tick up so fast - reminds me of watching Knightrider as a kid!
That car and the Driver is Federal!! Good Job
better title: zero emotions in 455 seconds
love it
Looking forward to seeing the new Roadster doing this.
The steering wheel if you can call it that looks awkward.
I know I'm gonna get shat on here... But would have thought it would at least break the 7 minute barrier. How are all these ice cars faster? Probably a weight and handling thing.
Not bad. Imagine if he hadn't had to drive it with a bloody yoke.. 😅
5:23😏
Very impressive considering the car that it is....gratz to the driver ofc also
It's less than 10 seconds faster than a 4 year old Civic Type R and it has 700 more hp.  Pathetic.
Is it showing in mile or km
Love this car!
Surely the test of an EV is through its endurance rather than it's speed.  The weight and time between charging cycles are the main challenge to battery technology. Any duffer can make it go fast.
Well that answers the question if Tesla is faster than a supercar :P
Hands up, every one, who needs a new diper❗️✋🏻
At first you expect a lot of "woomm woooooomm woom", but all you hear is ""whhii wiih squik brum". 🤣
Beeindruckend langweilig
OMG, doing 100 mph on a curve and around 268 mph on a straight road. This is insane! It must be nerve wrecking if you are inside!!
That is SCARY scary fast
Really think this steering wheel is not effective.
4:20 is the start of the carousel !!! Stoner illuminati confirmed
водитель не профессиональный
Как скучно…. Как будто играешь за компом в гонки без звука
От скрипа не развалилась под конец ?
I wonder how much faster he would’ve been with a proper steering wheel 😂
Electric cars sound like planes taking off.
Alien Technology
even if the tesla model s plaid is not clearly built for a race circuit and have a too soft balance, the result is impressive
Considering the hype and price this is nothing short of pathetic.
I kinda get airplane takeoff vibes from the audio after he hits 200+ ✈
94% SOC at the start and 57% at the finish. Maybe one more lap to full discharge.
Le pilote n est pas a l aise a cause du poids, pr atteindre les limites
Quel lourdeur
C'est tellement loin des autres comme le taycan que je comprends meme pas comment ils ont pu tenter le coup 😂, si ils auraient rien mis en ligne aux moins ils auraient pu faire ilusion lol
Karussell at 4:25
I think it's just too good for a road legal family car and it's surely going to take over the internal combustion supercars but whatever you say there is a different charm of the naturally aspirated ones they might not be as quick as the EVs but whenever you will listen to there exhaust sound you will surely become lunatic even at low speeds.
imagine the new battery in the future is half of the weight and higher or same performance.  it will fly.
made me throwback with GT6 scene  same  tyre noise & movement 😂  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4-WiVIi1Zs
oO
This car is too fast for this planet
10 seconds faster than the civic type R
Are the brakes recoverying energy for the motors?
What was the battery level at the end of lap? Any detailed numbers?
89th fastest time.   Not great, not terrible.
This has got to be the most boooooring lap i've ever seen,no emotions whatsoever.....that big inch TV is also a no no....
Is that speedometer in mph or kph?? Just curious because I know nothing about the track lol
Now do it with autopilot on.
Car balance is all over the place 😂
Que miedito, la inestabilidad de ese volante futurista es digna de un GP de F1. No es adecuado que un vehículo como ese sea de producción. Los superdeportivos son joyas admiradas tanto por su diseño como por su mecánica.  Sin mencionar que este tipo de coches eléctricos no son dignos de ser llamados superdeportivos, ni por apariencia ni por su ingeniería. No existe ningún beneficio para la sociedad en comercializar "masivamente" estos coches con esas aceleraciones, cuando las carreteras están restringidas a 120-140 km/h, donde cualquier persona con un carnet B estaría autorizado a conducirlo.
Looks a bit plastic and video game console.
F.A.S.T. Re-Defined.!!!
to put this into perspective, it beat the nissan GTR, lexus LFA, and the audi R8
Damn that thing is heavy
Did anyone realize the driver seemed OK with the Yoke steering wheel?
it's impressive just how much the driver is fighting with the stearing wheel. Now go check it out the Porshe 911 GT2 RS record video and look at stearing wheel. (just curiosity, we all know they're two completely different type of car but still fascinating. love Tesla btw!)
I count 4 times where the quality off the driver was in risk...too many Risk I saw...huge ball's!!!
Is that sweet sound the electric motor or is it a sound effect with a speaker?
surely it should be faster round the green hell?
😱
Imagine a day when Tesla AI drives people around like this lol.
The accumulation of velocity is as stark as the poor guy's lack of faith in the chassis (just look at the number of times he sits at a set speed, when he could go faster and then break again).  And the steering wheel is stupid
Straight line monster. But corners like a boat
Show us a picture of the tyres please 🙃
Nearly fell asleep.
Best time at Nürburgring is 6 min 43.3 sec.
Is this 100% not modified car? How can standard wheels survive after hitting edge of road at speed like this?
The car would deserve better (racing) brakes and suspension / wheels. Power-wise...., it has more than enough. (Very dangerous in a real life - cosmic acceleration but "not so cosmic" brakes.)
Like most American cars it wasn’t designed to go around corners
7min & 45Sec of pure anxiety..
Wow that jet engine sound is awesome
Missing the gasoline car sound ? No worry. You can turn sound effect at that screen.
anyone know what the two moving green bars are on the dash?
disgusting silence...never buy electro car in my life, I´d rather die, my hands will always driving gasoline car with manual shifting, .I. Brusels ecologic blackmailers
Good driver, in wet aswell, talented man.
1 lap = 1 tyre set.  This overweighted cars are the anti-sport ones.
167mph nice
wow
Last f1 pole in 1976 was 7:06:5: nearly there!
FYI: Porsche Taycan time was 7:42
I have anxiety watching this  Like if you agree
After 7:35 min around the Nürburgring the car wants to get charge
7:04 If the top speed exceeds 269 km/h the time attack will be even better?
Nd yet fast nd furious still didnt include electric car in there movies hh
3:36 bird poop on window
Those poor petrolhead, Alpha male, egotistical maniacal drivers sobbing into their petrol tanks while they morn their irrational belief that engine noise and power are inseparable.  Just imagine the insane belief that a byproduct of waste energy (sound) from the internal combustion process somehow equates to how big your ego is but really is a measure how small your brain and prick really are.  I can't wait for EV to proliferate.
Amazing 👏 car, tesla
with this bad drive.  so even if he was a professional driver, lower grades could have been made.
I thought it was the one where it crashed pretty slow compared to a real track car time of 6:43:30.  It doesnt matter how much power it has as it is hauling 540KG of battery with it all the time.
Wow, this is like watching a video race game
This thing is gonna rape everything out on the street. RIP dinosaur ice vehicles.
Great performance but you can tell that the car is heavy af.
Was this a standard Model S Plaid, or was is stripped, had track tires, etc? If standard, I wonder what the time could have been with some adaptations.
who is the driver?  if you put KW suspension and better brakes on it incl. sport cup 2 tyres you ll chip of 20 sec....
The car is insanely fast, but the driver is even more amazing. It really looks like a handful this car.
Why top speed 269 km/h ? Tesla plaid top speed 200mph or 320 km/h
Что там жужит скрипит
Nice
Superb the driver and the car.
wiki:shows/lists numerous   production/street legal cars about minute faster
Would be cool to see live energy output and battery use/capacity at these speeds and aggressive driving. In 10 years time what will everyday cars be capable of
As someone who doesn't know the first thing about motorsports, but has lots of experience in Mario Kart, I am pleasantly surprised about the amound of micro-drifting in this video
Next level : Let's try without pilot
I swar to god when iam smh able to race in a tesla one day for a living i would cry every night of happiness
when the track pack comes out with slicks, bigger brakes, Track-mode and Aero, its gonna go pretty damn quick
These soccer mom cars are flogging HyperCars. How embarrassing this is for the ICE industry.
Fantastic a bit faster lap than a Honda Civic.
7:37 is a decent lap time, congratulations. You beat the nurburgring <3
Obvious sounds there of loss of traction and squeezing tires, I assume this is due to the mass of the battery... Awesome footage thus far, thank you Tesla
Do that again... but in a Tesla Van!
Are those miles per hours or kilometres per hour on the screen?
Excellent ❤️❤️
Sheeeeesh that car is bustin bustin
3:36 RIP bug
is regenerativ breaking still on?
Can we see it learn his driving and then do a lap on autopilot>!?
👍👍👍
Der liegt aber sehr unruhig auf der Straße :(
Speedometer is flying 🔥
Looks like steering a ship... hard work for the driver.
that's awesome man !!! waiting for this car launch in India
Rimac’s unfinished dragster will remain silent on this 😝
How is a Civic Type R only 8 seconds slower than this monster?
topping out at just 265kph... not exactly that good for 1000+hp.  overheat still a problem I guess
The driver's doing a lot of sawing/nibbling at the steering...lack of feel?
Can you make a non lithium car these are so bad for the environment Like maybe something that produces CO2 for plants Plants love CO2.. Lithium is toxic and you should be ashamed.. YUCK! filithy pollution mobiles.
i stopped counting how many times the driver was about to lose control and crash, kudos to him but the car just isnt made for the track, period
Imagine how fast it could have been with a real steering wheel to control the car with!
slow driver tbf , had to also test it on self driving mode, also feels like the car needs more traction and downforce
My god the power out of the corners
Is it me or is this car very quiet compared to traditional  cars going at that speed?
Would have been so special having the Queen of Nurburgring Sabine Schmitz at the wheel driving the Model S Plaid. RIP Sabine, Never forgotten.
The next step is the lap record in autopilot mode….
Damn! I watched that speedometer and it looks like it topped out at 265! 👀 Put on the Autobahn now to get a top speed. Those electric motors are ridiculous!
How very boring!
So a 1000hp+ EV has the same time as an average 500hp petrol car. That's a bit disappointing..
It handles the corners like a little focus rs, wonder if they both weight the same or if the video is sped up, remember this track is not just about power, weight and handling are more important
This video is mesmerizing
Plaid with metric speedo! Nice 😁
When you fix your visor whilst going round a bend 👀
At one point the driver hit 268mph. This car is entirely stock? Amazing!
Τιμόνι απο PlayStation;
That steering wheel should be optional
This looks too fun!
Politiker: "Stellen Sie sich vor in meiner Jugend wollte ich Räuber werden!" Zuhörer: "Sie Glücklicher! Wer kann sich schon seinen Jugendtraum erfüllen?"
after watching this you should watch the fastest nürburgring lap ever of the Porsche 919 Hybrid Evo, its on youtube also
Titanium balls on this guy!
Amazing!!!
Truly amazing!!!
Nice bee bee beep at aremberg corner. I assume hot brake warning just like in my Model 3? You should change the brake fluid now.
Good thing about the ring it is that it will show weak links of a car, time is respectful, appreciated and hats off to Tesla for EV record, but consider the fact that we are witnessing flood of Plaid vs the everything else on dragstrips and in 99% Plaid is clearly a winner i expected it to be faster on ring, better handling and better brakes. But they are not important on 402m, right?
slower than audi RS3 lol
I think this can be driven cleaner and if done so it would also be slightly faster
Optimus Stig
Этот звук, будто бы из кибер панка
The perfect ASMR video.
How fast can you take this thing on auto pilot
Now lets see what FULL AI can do....o wait....
This is basically Tesla ASMR. Love the futuristic sound of the engine!
Damn - you can really tell how heavy that thing is... but yes it's freakin' FAST! 😜
He about screwed up coming out of the carousel
And all in First Gear !
Still hate the steering wheel.
You can see that the driver becomes a bit conservative in some of the high speed sections, coasting for a bit before the braking zone. The slower turning response of the car might have a part to play, as the driver has to allow the car's suspension more time to load up for a turn. Compared to a supercar it seems slow, but for a full-size sedan it performed remarkably well.
fahrerisch top 👌 .... nur der 'Sound' ist so grausam 🙈🤷‍♂️
Nice work lads :)
Nicely done 👏🏻👏🏻
impressive, yes. This is not a race car by any measure, Tortured tires, this car is soo heavy, I genuinely feel scary for the driver, tiny mistake and you off into the wall. I wonder what the driver has to say after the lap. Just in comparison I watched Zonda R, it looked so much faster and easier.
saluons l'exploit de Tesla de n'être pas cette fois repartie sur dépaneuse  et d'avoir su exploiter ses 1020 ch pour arriver à battre  une Taycan turbo de  680 ch 😂
This driving style sucks IMO.
Forza 8 sneak peak
may those tires rest in peace
I want to see a drift for that steeringwheel!
They should let Lewis Hamilton or one of the formula 1 drivers drive that car. I’m sure they cut a few more seconds off that time.
this is Gran Turismo 7 ...
now James May can say "Model S has been ruined because it has been around the Nürburgring"
Can’t wait to see this without a driver!
already has a cracked windshield
Take PLAID to Dragstrip....bruise an ego or two accidentally....drive Fam home and pickup groceries on the way! Done! ( Note to self: Don't forget Milk)
I'm surprised it didn't catch on fire...if he would have done 1 more lap though...and just like those 2 people in California he would have died in it because of those pop out door handles that need electricity to pop out...because  when the batteries are on fire, there's no electricity for the door handles to pop out...also, hard pass on that joke steering wheel...
Wish you could see the G forces. Congrats on the record!
169 mph on the straight
It sounds like the car never struggled and didn't used much of his charge. Like it could have done 5-10 laps
Come to Forza horizon 5
How much acceleration do you want?  Driver: yes
The steeringwheel seems a bit silly
The car is amazing. I'm equally impressed by how people can adapt to such high speeds and control any car and make turns in split seconds and adjust
terrible suspension and cornering sucks..straight speed 11/10
MPH or Kilometers per hour?
That was the best Video game I've ever played in my Life!  Love it!
This is incredible news,  Elon is an amazing Icon that deserves credit.
OK TESLAS ARE AWESOME BUT WHO IS THAT DRIVER ???
So, still slower than a BMW M5, Panamera Turbo S, GT63 AMG, etc. Not exactly a hypercar killer, is it? And not exactly a great showing for an EV with 1000+ hp. It's basically a liiiiiittle bit faster than 350hp FWD hatchbacks that cost 1/3 as much in fact. Tesla fanboy delusions shattered badly by this. It's slower than cars that weigh more and have around 400hp less than this car. Not very impressive, in fact, you can tell the chassis quality and handling are far, far, far from being as good as on the best ICE similar class cars, because even setting this lap it looked like a handful, fairly unstable, the driver didn't go through basically a single corner without heavy corrections. Watch the Panamera Turbo S video for example as a contrast and to see how a properly well handling car goes around this track, that car is on rails, it's so stable, rides over bumps so well, it's so composed, all while taking corners at higher speeds.   Tesla is 20 years behind top established car makers in terms of driving dynamics and chassis development.
🥶
Wow, wow, wow, go Tesla go !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!zoom!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Now do it hands free
Amazing car
Guess that must feel like turning a boat in the see I can feel the driver struggling. Takes some balls to drive this so fast like this in the ring
Would been cool if they had it race with the self driving beta
Tesla surprised us once again.
Thanks for this. I was getting bored with drag race's. Can not wait to get mine. Just taking a while in RHD format. All the best from #CarRelatedShorts
Looks fast, but how fast is 289mL/joule or whatever that Commy measurement was?
It's the same time as a BMW M5 F90! That's fast, but also quite disappointing for what is marketed as the supposedly "worlds fastest production car". The acceleration is 0-100 is really insane, but after that, it seems to drop off significantly if you compare it to the GT2 RS lap. The top speed is also really low in comparison to most other fast cars, and there is a huge delta when it comes to cornering speed.  Now the question is whether Porsche will give it a shot and beat it with the Tycan Turbo S.
this is definately km/h i was freaking out for a second there
sería interesante si mostraran la velocidad
Ya definitely want to check your kex for gravy after a lap like this.
268mph is crazy he almost went 300 wtf 😳 yall wanna go faster do that shi on Mars we dont have enough straights for that gunna need a 10 mile run . Build it and they will come
Kinda weird that if you look behind the aftermarket speedo the built-in one is way over-reporting the speed?
Time to go clean my self !! 👌👍😂🇺🇸
My man knows how to 𝕨 𝕚 𝕘 𝕘 𝕝 𝕖
The yoke is a yoke!
Мертвые вдоль дороги с косами стоят... И тишина...
Damn !!!! I was holding my breath and I’m NOT even DRIVING !!! Well done Tesla! 👍🇺🇸👌
Congratulations.  Please add a camera in the footwell so we can see the footwork in a smaller window.
Don't get fooled ! He was on FSD !
I'm guessing that speedometer is showing kilometers per hour not miles? Anyway, nice hardcore smackdown to ICE cars. I only wish Tesla had made that yoke steering wheel optional instead of mandatory. Looked like it was about to be yanked from the driver's hands multiple times during the run.
Need the top speed unlocked, definitely could shave couple seconds
It sounds so fucking cool when he steps on it! Like a space ship
and this is a Sedan... mind blown.
Looks like tesla needs to work on that suspension, things struggling around the corners
I find the lack of internal combustion engine noise absolutely terrifying.
Bravo! "Hands Clapping"
Looks like the drift school track. When I was at Nuremberg Ring between 1999 and 2004, there was the quarter-mile, rally, and drift-school tracks (mostly Bimmers and Porsches). Quarter mile was dominated by the Muppet Racer. 69 VW Beetle with a Porsche 944 engine swap and a wheelie bar.  Painted metallic flake gold with the muppets all over it, and stuntman Gonzo big as life on the driver's door.
Could it go faster? Looks scary fast. Haha 💚
I’m crying because this car is such a mess. The antithesis of a driver’s car. Absolutely unable to conquer this track. All of its speed comes from the straight sections, no different than a Dodge Charger. You all only like it because it’s progressive. So much ignorance.
If this was a gas car you would be able to hear just how much he has to lift to get this thing to go around that track. Way too much power and weight to be composed around a racetrack. Also it doesn’t even have carbon ceramic brakes. For a car with over 1,000 hp to not have carbon ceramic brakes is ludicrous. That’s why one of these things crashed at the track.
Are we there yet? Yes, we are.
Geat acceleration but, suspension seems too soft to manage most of the curves
Hey @TESLA do it in COTA (Austin, Texas USA), as it was purposely built F1 race track from the scratch, that cost $1+ Billion.  And your coming soon largest manufacturing facility is also in Austin, Texas.  Have a great day to y'all!
Who was driving by the way?  Just curious…
Only 8 seconds faster than a Honda Civic 😂😂😂😂
Any information on the time ??
the only place where that stupid steering "wheel" makes sense
Next up: Tesla sets new lap time in a hovercar
Tesla: "I need a vacation"
I feel that Elon should create a market place that will over take Jeff Bozo’s Amazon!
Elon 💪 Jeff BESOS 🖕🏻
yikes it squeels alot on the easy turns
This is super cool but if t was a race car what will you do when it runs out of battery? It would take to long to recharge it
why only 165 mph?
Handled like a pig
Future of all race cars now and it's boringgggg
Amazing
I hope you're paying that very driver well for all their precision and machine-learning training data! Haha. I can not wait to see a pack of AI tunes cars driving this track soon enough.
The weight of Bowser and DK. The acceleration of Yoshi and Toad.
Make me want to bust out Granturismo and run a few laps
Seems like the yoke steering works just fine.
Necesito uno de esos para ir a comprar el pan calentito.
If only Sabine Schmitz had had been driving in it...😥RIP
How many KM do you get on a charge if you drive like this.
If you race competitively and you've ever wanted to turn up the sound of your tires, this is the way you do it.
If the AI is just learning new tricks of this driver's skills, this can easily be a lot of data.
My only question is why is there a driver? Drive the car once, then let the computer drive the simulated course 10,000 more times, then let it back on the real thing. You would think the AI driver could navigate it the fastest, at the absolute limit of the car.
6:40
Dang 265 miles per hour OK
Amazing, proud to be a Tesla MS owner
7:35 is terribly slow for all the power it has. Old man R35 GT-R got a faster time still LMAO!
nice shoulders !
Me: And _still_ when I get home my burger is cold and soggy...
What's that number on top of the speedometer?? Begins 21 ends at 66...
I would love of of seen Sabine do the lap in this car :(
Be vewy vewy qwuiet...
congrats
I’m a Tesla fan, but that thing handles like a boat!
What was the lap time? Did it beat the Nismo GTR? Like to see on Autobahn
God that was boring to watch.  Say what you want but without the sound of the motor and exhaust this is a complete snore fest.
If Elon Musk not reply on this message its fake :D
Cars so heavy as nimbal as a fat toddler at the beach
How soon before we see FSD run the course?
Of course the video ends when he is going 69, coincidence?
HE should have been in the 6:45 range. At 1/4 speed you can see all his mistakes, like he was afraid of where the next curve was.
Even cooler if it did it self driving.
Wrong guy driving...yawn  269 when he had easily a 275 road ahead of him!  Is R. Pobst around?
he's not even turning, he's just powersliding around corners.
sounds like a goddamn spaceship
Sound are sux
That is a nice car & a nice ride
Elon! Can we get the spaceship acceleration sound pumped into the speakers coolest sound ever.
I would love to experience this as the co-driver!
Waiting to see the same course done using FSD Beta.
Modified, non-standard track mode, upgraded brakes...invalid!
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nürburgring_Nordschleife_lap_times  in good company on the wiki short list
They beat Porsche like they wanted to. Taycan set a 7:42, S Plaid set a 7:35
HOLY SHIT!! What a ride! Firstly did you guys consider weight reduction. The driver's 30X stainless steel balls alone must weigh a damn ton, ffs! Secondly, when is Tesla going to come out with an amusement park where they get a bunch of those old NASA G-force training dealies and just play this video on the inside. Thirdly, I can't wait to see the tri-motor cyber truck match this time! Congratulations everyone! Fantastic work!
It takes 8 minutes to ho around and his going that fast lul
Cool to see Pro's handle consumer cars. The weight has got to be a little weird for him, but he's clearly handling it. Not surprised by the speed.
This is amazing W0o0o0W i wanna drive it its a dream to go to the moon . Dark side of the moon pink floyd
Crazy to think that the Viper ACR is over 35 seconds faster than this on the Nurburgring.
I enjoy hearing the tires fight for their lives.
Is that going up in miles or kms?
great time for a car with stock tires and mediocre brakes. easy upgrades that can be done by owners; should push this even more
So incredible and seemingly unbelievable. Hard to wrap your brain around it, i.e. a 4dr sedan being everything. Outstanding job as well driver. Congratulations Tesla/#elonmusk!
Does anyone know which tires are on it?
What causes the ~10kmph difference between the two displays at 6:58?
That's not real.  It's Automobilista 2.  When did they release the Plaid?  LOL.  Seriously, this is the death knell of gas engines.
I wish I could see the speedometer in MPH but I know 250 is 155 and 200 is 124.
I love the short and sweet video description. No need to end the sentence when you just dropped the mic.
You can just tell the only thing making that car handle is the torque vectoring. The body control is all over the place!
@Tesla, have FSD drive with a perfect time.
Nice !
Is that speed on the screen MPH!?
*BMW M5 has left the chat*
Wow, this driver has got a huge pair of balls.  That car looks sketchy on the track.
Is that speedometer in miles or kilometers?
Tesla putting down the gauntlet in Germany, next step open giga Berlin, next step walk away with half of the german car market  - exactly what happened in the USA.. ask Ford, GM and the rest.
A Koeniggsegg can reach 268 MPH on a 15-mile long stretch of absolutely straight desert road. I think this Tesla model S Plaid must be 268 kilometers per hour = 166.52748 miles per hour.
The "yoke" wheel needs to go, it's horrid.
RIP ICE
I also can’t wait to see an all out lap with FSD on!
Моя мечта тестировать так тесла
That's a fast Tesla 💨👀
The kids will never be late for practice now!!
Imagine how much faster it would've been with a proper steering wheel.
you can really see how this car is still not made for the race track
Should've gone for a few more laps, the driver (who did a great job regardless) was still getting used to the car on that specific track, you can actually see the development during the lap.
That thing is a boat at the corners
Love the new steering wheel on the new models!
i'm under the impression that when it have it's top speed unlocked, it will do this lap even faster, i'm really curious to see this.
So much HP and it didn't even went over 268 km/h????
locuron
Shit sounds like it's going to fall apart....
Would be faster with Exro
So much tech and why it looks so difficult to control?... Mostly during braking! It looks it went all over the place sometimes! Very good shooting, though! Thanks for sharing!
Slower than an RS3 which has 394 hp haha
Fake displays? This Plaid is more Light?
get some slicks on and see how fast that thing can actually runs
Who is the driver?
Steering wheel design looks awkward and unpractical. Cannot control steering angles properly especially when crossed up. Just stupid design for sake of being different. Aside from this and watching in silence, I found myself totally disinterested anyway. Vehicle is fast, but silence is  boring and soulless.
Imagine driving a Plaid through Nürburgring in Forza 7 while in your Plaid as this guy drives your Plaid through Nürburgring.
So, when will Autopilot get this feature?
Ah, I see they got that Tesla bot working.
There's another easy 5 seconds of time in there, driver is kinda bad.
But the real question, can it drift?
What does it sound like going past outside the car?
I assume what's on the steering wheel is more accurate to the reading on the dash? there's a bit of difference in the numbers they're showing
How much battery left after that lap?
That limited speed kills it.. It could do a much better time if they'd allow it  higher speeds!
That's really impressive, but the fact the civic type r is only 13 seconds slower with 1/3 of the power is more impressive. If they get the tesla to grip, that would easily be a sub 7 minute lap
I didn’t see that line on the road that tells you when to brake, lol. Awesome job though! Hats off to the driver.
Props to the driver for not sending this thing into a whole new dimension through the guardrails with this acceleration, It's kind of scary how quick these cars are getting
Well done Tesla. What an achievement for an EV without producing emission during the lap. AMG GT-4 Door is faster, but it helps nothing to environment.
Maximum speed 268 kph?!!!
Someone said Plaid couldn't do track.
Love watching this on loop again, again, again.....
It’s like he’s playing a video game with cheats on
Nice workout..topped the 160mph... Tyres could be more sticky...
I feel that autopilot can handle this without a driver
Sketchy AF
Tesla smashed it 👍🏻
If you have not noticed, we can see the car’s speedometer being the display and there is a 11km/h difference at top speed….
I'm more interested in how fast can FSD drive in next a few years 😜.
Incredible. Scary 😧
Fast but boring…….if that’s the future I had better get my hands on an m3 v8 before everyone else wants one
Stunning work
Simply amazing. Congrats 🎉🎈
So fucking slow compared to petrol driven cars 😂
Official Nurbergring video has g graph and course map overlays  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=em4I4V-AvBo
WOAH
Soon the F1 will be hacked by Russia, porn will be showing on the control screens except in the Russian car, which has a dummy copy only that doesn't work.
Wild
that shit looked scar af lmao tf. thats a fast car damn
Now THIS is the proper venue for yoke steering —unlike on everyday streets. A racecar driver has his hands constantly gripping the handholds, and never has to turn either of them more than 90° to get through those racetrack curves. Superb handling by the driver! High five to him!
I've never felt empathy for tires before.
So many Tesla fanboys here. I thought that they are aiming to beat Mercedes and yet Tesla is 8 seconds slower and has 400extra hp! This only shows how crappy the handling of Tesla is... And that steering wheel what a joke seriously. But yeah typical tesla customer want to be fastest in 1/4 mile as they are scared to actually enjoy such car in corners...
GranTurismo flashbacks. I know these turns!
Where are your phone? Charging!
Saw the Porsche Evo video, now everything else looks slow in comparison.
269km/h top speed in the last bit.
Oke, so.. he charging the phone and use gps.
I wonder how stupid it is to lose your pointless life in a race like this? If it is for a computer game go ahead and race, but for real life you must be a moron. Remember the purpose: ad astra!
<...Question mark when the head saddened also of the very outsourced non fun realms ... ? Naw bin trash bin naw run away ...>
Loved my P85D and P100D hated the customer service. I now drive something else RIP Tesla you’re dead to me.
Poor brakes, that car is so heavy it looks like a train derailing more than cornering. However, the acceleration is mind-blowing, but on a track brakes are just as important and clearly the Plaid needs an upgrade to balance the (ridonculous) power.
I wonder what a Ring Taxi driver could do
Bugs: “There are no loud noises. Let go….”
Oh my fucking days!
pretty interesting hearing all the sounds that are not being drowned out by an ice engine
Love how the cell phone doesn't even move in the charging port.
'Counter Intuitive Steering' like on a Motorbike! :)
I would do it slower!
that's km/h shown on the dash, right?
😴😴😴😴😴
Love the car, HATE the silly steering wheel.
1020hp, same laptime as 400hp audi, what a shitcar
This looks scarry asf
Holy crap my anxiety watching this 😅😂😭  4:55:45 PM 9/10/2021
I wanna see the tires.
All while producing zero emissions. Nice. 👍
If you ever hear you tires squeal you have failed
Did anyone else notice the speed on the car was higher by about 10kph compared to the mounted speedometer? Look at 7:01
Soso
Someone needs to edit this video with the Jetsons car sound effect and match the sound pitch with the speed of the car.
You look good on straights
OMG!!! Congrats to Tesla for another smack down to the internal combustion engine. I did notice the driver did not have to cross hands throughout the lap - which indicates that the Yoke steering wheel is not a "Joke" as Edmunds would have us believe.
You are so late on every Corner
Beautiful driving experience. Welcome to the future!
Why did they just put it on auto pilot max speed and do it with no human in it?
the stearing is very nervous and the tires are crying it out….l
Next time: Autopilot - then i'll be impressed
Incredible! Congrats Tesla!
1,020 hp? The four door Audi RS3 does a 7:35 with only 394 hp.
the sound the car makes when its accelerating is awesome!
Dear other Carmanufacturers: This is the exactly the camera angle (and placement) we'd like to see from You too from an on-board video.
And now drive at the autobahn
Tires are begging for mercy!
The noise is so loud! I can’t bare the noise!!!
Does it have roll cage? Should be dangerous without it.
*The car makes **_Gundam_** sounds when it accelerates.*
i wonder why the pilot doesn't have a  momo steering wheel for a record attempt, could that accessory be considered cheating ?
Fast, but damn that handling is jittery.
Looks like he’s driving a simulator and not a real car. 😂 I’m surprised that it didn’t catch on fire somewhere around 6-th minute on track…
Два момента: руль - как показалось не очень удобный и громкий скрип в салоне
What video game is that?
Those poor tyres. So how much faster with the slicks, aero and better brakes? Going by the squeal I’d guess into the 6’s
Faster than M5 and Porsche Taycan.  Well done Tesla. Love the two footed driving.
More than 3 sec slower than a Giulia QV lmao.
Get the feeling, with a normal wheel it would be 10s faster
nice CGI tesla...
Is that miles per hour or kilometers per hour?
Certainly a good performance. Although I must say, that the driving seems a little wobbly in comparison with my BMW 5 series. But we're getting there.
The quietness of this video really makes me wonder when a gas engine is running these the tire are probably just as loud but the engine is louder
The tires were working as hard as the pilot 😅
accelerates like crazy handles well but you can feel the weight, its a hefty boy
I have never heard, that a Microwave can set a Nurburgring Lap Record. 🤮 Unnecessary knowledge. Bxllshxtcxr
How about doing this with FSD  ?  mb in Schumacher-mode  :-)
The wheel rotation seems modified. I saw the MKBHD video and he seems struggling to rotate the wheel just to turn to a 90-degree corner.
Don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic car and an excellent driver for sure. However, I was somewhat surprised that it reached "only" around 270 km/h on the straight which is kind of low given its official top speed of over 320 km/h. With Plaid, SOC has only very little impact on performance as far as I know (unless SOC is very low which surely it wasn't). Probably still somewhat limited by thermals after such a lap?
Must have been running out of battery juice towards the last straight. only 265Km/h? We need denser Batteries
Is it in kmh or mph?
So about 8 seconds faster than a civic type-r that costs 1/3 of the price? Nice!
Is the speedometer in miles of kilometres per hour?
Scary 😬
Tesla Roadster at the Nürburgring when?
My kids think I drive like this when we launch. Wait until I show them this.
Got to get the record! Tesla Roadster for the win?
Is that a crack in the windshield?
5:23 driver regrets having a curry the night before.
Can imagine an F1 race with electric cars. I almost fell asleep watching this! Fast though..
Only passing by at 418kilometer\hours what the actual fuck
kinda lame
Absolutely shocking handling, it's like driving a waterbed
Me on the way home afterwork 😂
That dude nails the apexes!
Am I the only one that gets chills when you hear the electric motor sound? 🥶
This car doesn’t like cornering if I hear those tyres scream. It is way too heavy. Great acceleration though.
268
Now let's see how fast the FSD computer can do it!
Honestly I expected this car to be in the 7min 20s. Something doesn't add up. If you look at just pure numbers of horsepower, torque and weight, that time is kind of slow. Is this car still limited, I see it tops out at 268 KMH?
When they release the full power it will take a lot to keep on the tarmac. A professional driver will struggle with the dynamics of a family sedan with the performance of a super car.
Is the mph or km?
There's probably a 2 hours unedited version. I can watch this all day.
Up to 165mph.  Speedy!
Not yet. To impress me, please turn on FSD.
Now watch this 2x speed. What incredible skills are needed to drive this machine!
The next record breaker vehicle from Tesla will be the cybertruck. Can you imagine a pickup truck breaking this record?
The top speed of the model S Plaid is 320km/h. I expected this car to easily exceed 300km/h at the long straight part at the end of the track…
Another toaster with wheels?
Queue the “but I can’t hear the X number of cylinders as it exits the corners…it has no…no.. soul!”  Remember I.C.E stands for It Can’t End!!
Lap time would be faster if the driver had a more comfortable steering wheel.
love the relative cabin silence, the screeching and the occasional sound of the racetrack edging drumming the tyres...
Is that MPH or KPH..
Yolk look straight up looks dangerous on a track, espcially when going opposite-lock. Not a fan. Decent time but you're still getting taken out by 10-15 year old ICEs. Great road car, bad track-focused car. Unlike ICE cars, EVs get slower the longer you drive them - not competition friendly, but they both serve their purposes. Good work Tesla, but many more strides to come.
edmunds review didn't like yoke steering, this driver didn't seem to have any problems.
Congrats on a great lap time for a factory stock sedan.  Definitely should be able to find more speed with soft compound tires and more track oriented brake components.
This guy cant drive
Now do it with "Autopilot"
Is this in Dino mode?
True american car, hella fast going straight, struggles to turn lol
An AI could get an even better time lol
Is this the run where it was towing a Taycan?
Tesla let's rattle on a smooth road :)
I watched this in 2x 🤒
Am I blind or top speed was limited to 268 kph? I just learned that top speed is currently limited till new update. After update top speed will be increased to 320 kph. It's a shame Tesla didn't run lap after that update, it would be several seconds faster after the last straight.
It's like the Millennium Falcon on wheels.
And until 2050 so many stupid things like this will come! Glad I will not be alive to see all.
POV you're riding shotgun with Chad.  Hands got sweaty just watching this from my desk.
That's one spicy family sedan!
The tires sound very angry with this whole exercise.
i guess one of the speedometers was not accurate, wonder which one.
this track is so fucking dangerous
fantastic 😄 👍
How much battery did you kill doing this?
And it was with the yoke steering wheel! Impressive.
that wheel reminds me of Knightrider.. is KIT driving?
Watch how the driver introduces the car to the bend with a very subtle pre-emptive adjustment of the wheel in the direction of the turn.it sets the car up for a smooth entry and acceleration on exit by shifting the cars centre of gravity towards the bend.its a good advanced technique for confident everyday driving and quickly becomes second nature.
Needs a split time against the Porsche Taycan.
Watching a car go around the nurburgring without sound is like having sex with a no-orgasm policy
The speed out of and through the corners is some next level performance. Imagine if this was stripped out and had racing mods...
It'd be laughably slow, but it'd be fun to send FSD Beta around to the ring to see how it'd do.
Красота😍
please bring Tesla to Pakistan i m begging u ......
Would be nice to have a display of the speed on the video.
I'd like to ride on a hot lap but am not sure I could keep my eyes open from to sheer terror.
Nobody: These tires: “ERRRRRRYYYYYEEEERRREWWWERRRRRUUUUUUUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE”
Paramiz yok elon amca bana bir tesla alsan ölürmusun.Cok zenginsin cok bana bir arabay hediye et lutfen
nur 7 Sekunden schneller als Porsche mit dem Tycan (Propotype) . Ernüchternd. Un wenn man schaut wie unruhig das Lenkrad ist....  Lasst mal Fahrwerksspezialisten ran. Auch scheinen die Reifen nicht optimal für den Wagen zu sein. only 7 seconds faster than Porsche with the Tycan (Propotype). Sobering. And when you look at how restless the steering wheel is .... Let the suspension specialists take over. The tires also don't seem to be ideal for the car.
Like cow on the ice
For those metrically impaired such as me, the apparent peak speed reached of 268 km/h is 166mph.
LOL that sound, its like airplane, so addictive. Add wings to it!
Is it being driven by a Tesla bot with sporty red hand upgrades? 😃
Man. This guy is a great driver. He really pushed it to the limit in every turn.
Sabine Schmitz would have done it in 7: 30 :)  rip ..
I felt sorry for those tyres ! They were begging for mercy .  Imagine what it could do with some tweaks for circuit driving and batteries that don’t over heat.
How long until FSD with no driver in the car can do it quicker?
I can do better at 7:26, the jerk motion alone added 4secs. :D
How is the handling?? Please say that isn't the sound of plastic interior crunching around!
Might need some new tires after that....
damn amazing gear changes you did there
why did it go so slow in the straight part towards the end? expected max acceleration there
Paid takes a corner at 120 km/hr, immediately accelerates to 230km/hr. This is crazy!!
I would love to see what those tires looked like after this lap!!
It looks like he is just braking permanently 😂
With headphones on, the sound when the car accelerates, sounds like from a sci Fi movie ngl.
watch the video at 2x speed... its a thrill.  going back to 1x seems like the video's regular speed is already slowed down for some reason
As much as I love Tesla, the vibration in the arm of the pilot and the noises of the chassis tell me there is still some way to go…
This video is missing some rev matching
I wouldn’t even mind going over 200+ kmph in such a safe car
That steering wheel bothers me and I cant get over how bad it is
Is the speedometer in kmph or mph
Очень круто) Интересно сколько он потратил киловатт?
Looks very scary without a steering wheel….
This driver is just friggin' pushin' it. The tires are going to be shredded at the end of the run. So much more difficult without the feedback from the engine sounds. Would be nice to have a camera on the speed-o-meter. Wonder how much battery capacity is left after that run.
What is the production vehicle record?
It is even very slow on the long straight, it does not get above ~270 km/h with 1034 PS. Audi RS3 with 400 PS went to 290 km/h limiter or very close to it. If this should prove supremacy of EVs, it went terribly wrong. Much more luxurious Panamera Turbo S with mere 630 PS is faster than this and does not behave like a boat with very similar weight...
It had enough battery to finish a lap ? 🤔
PORSCHE was, is and will be always PORSCHE. No way!
And this is on p4s michelin. Can't wait to see on a cup 2 or soemthing like that
Amazing 🤩
Dream car
6:50-7:24 Was he holding back? Is this part going uphi? With 200mph top speed the car should be able to go beyond 265 more easily
Wow
Speechless! Just like that motor!
Now this is the rare electric car that won't have any issues regarding rusty brakes and such
How much boost was th car on?
Wow, yoko thing and all
maan he cannot even control it properly thats how fast it is...you can see how he strugles from time to time because of the massive accelaration...its too fast boyyy...great job guys...awesome car....it can get faster i know but i think safety is a must before speed...its a reallly fast car....for whoever has this tesla model be carefull dude its a really fast car...great job again guys ...ow just a note for the robot you are making .. dont forget to add a bit of random spice to it...its the secret ingridient....!!!have a nice day
Why there is a difference in speed on hud and on tablet?
Wahoooouuu😅
No shit, well done engineers!
That isnt hanging around for a big saloon car.Very impressive!
Question? Is the speedometer in mph or kmh?
That steering wheel must be a yoke...a yoke (if you watch F1 you'll get it)
J'ose même pas imaginer l'état des pneus 😆
Seeing how top speed isn't unlocked yet this shouldn't be the record yet. That would be like Toyota coming out with a car with a limiter on it at production but Toyota themselves removing the limiter to set a record (only with hardware/software that they have access to only). It's a great feat though.
Wow!
🤩
How depressing
Lap time?
Wait for me with auto pilot
TesLá
That yoke looks like a baby steering wheel. Give that person a real yoke wheel.
3:35 bird takes a dump on the windshield
Finally proof that Tesla should stick to the dragstrip.
Pretty amazing considering the fact that it's using relatively normal sport 4S tires and no spoiler at the back. Add semislicks and a spoiler and you'll have some fun numbers
I can feel the weight of this car in my soul.
Awesome!!
Roll out the roadster
bleah🤮
A+ to the driver! By the tire squeal he's pushing hard 👍
Next stop let FSD test it out.
OOOHHH S..T😲
Real life iron man😎😎
Is this a stock car?  Kinda looks it.  Get it unlocked.  modify: tires, breaks, aero.  Go again.
Shout out to ALL the "reviews" saying it's hard to drive with a yoke steering.
One day I will make a airomobile company which based on electric supplied power like Tesla  And it became very successful
huh, for german Autobahn you still have to work on that max speed, otherwise suitable ;p
From this video we know  If you give any poorly made barge and some monet then he give you lap record
Why is the speed difference on the external digital gauge than the internal gauge cluster? Seemed like an 8~10 KM difference. Different tire size setup?
P100D owner. This is great but can be much better.  2 issues I see immediately: Plaid is woefully under-tired.  That squealing in every corner had me stressed out the whole lap. Please, put better tires on with the Track Pack.  Next, top speed is still electronically limited to 267kph. It could've easily hit 300+ on the final straight and shaved 4-5 seconds with that only.  Sub- 7:15 is easily achievable.
The new Forza graphics on the Xbox look really good. 👀
Rimac right now: Hold my charging cable!
🥱
Congrats! Your turn Porsche !
That’s in kilometers right?
269MPH 🤪
Go Baby Go!!!!!!
Love it! Looks like there is a speedometer calibration error around 10kmph on tesla vs control device.
Автомобиль просто бомба
#Vega Evx https://youtu.be/Bf3YKDADwKo
Who's driving?
insane!
Wow this thing sounds heavy haha
Jeremy Clarkson : "oh"
My heartbeat was racing with that speedometer reading, just by looking at this video!!
The driver is obviously not Samir
Andreas Simonsen from Sweden is the driver and should be acknowledged :)
Next do it with auto pilot
That driver has some nerves of steel 😱
I really want to see the new roadster doing this. This is gonna be insane.
Wow..!
... Amazing... But what model exactly?...
Should strap Clarkson to the hood so he can complain how boring it is.

😮😮
How many corrections does the driver need to do to go around a corner.     Model S Plaid: "Yes"
This is glorious.  So smooth and powerful.
Fridge to pantry .
küss dein herz
Incredible performance from a factory-spec car!    Could definitely see times where the driver had to back off due to suspension limitations, and others that looked to be due to brake management.. Can't wait to see the improvements with a few basic mods!  The Future is Now (sic) ;)
Man this new Gran Tourismo footage is legit!
Glad the steering wheel didn't fall off
Am i the only one who watched this entire video without skipping?
Beast
This is what the yoke steering wheel is for, not everyday driving
I'm guessing the speedometer is displaying km/h. What is are the 2 bars meant to represent?
Why is there so much difference in the speedometers? Pause any moment and the difference is ~5km/h more on the built in dash
fast but you can tell it handles awkward in some situations
⚡👊⚡
Dude had his kids in the back seat😱
He really had to fight with the steering thing to get it pointing where he wanted, especially after the long straight. Also, he brakes way way earlier than other competitors. Not trusting that massive weight transfer maybe?
Why is this guys holding back!?!? He should be sending it in the short sections.
Impressive! It beats an Audi rs3 by 5 seconds! Still 1 second slower than a 2009 gtr...
He should have lane assist engaged
Amazing. Thanks Tesla!
🔥🔥
How much battery left after this?
"And yes, driver was Tesla bot."
Great lap ! BUT, 1'28'20 at Laguna Seca and 7'35 at the Nürburgring.  How such a difference is possible ? For example, the Hurracan Performante did 1'30 at LS (same driver)  and sub 7 min at the Nord.
Tesla:  *sells absolute rocket ship on wheels to mortals Edmunds:  'The only reason you made it that fast is so you can sell it" Tesla:  'ummm'
Lets do this again with 330 km/h lol
Gran Turismo 7. 🤤
I'm happy that Tesla directly goes into the content instead of listening to some random useless stuff.
Tesla is the best, and they show us what an ev can do, the oems are talking............................
I mean nice record.... but its insane to think that a  Porsche Cayenne GT did it quicker by 2 seconds.... and didn't need    1,020 horsepower and 1,050 lb-ft of torque.....
Ferocious acceleration out of the corners.  but appears to be limited to indicated 266km/h, with a creep up to 268km/h (166mph).  We will all like to see it at full potential.
Can't corner for crap,  a GTR or Corvette ZR1  smoke this thing
For being as fast as it is in a straight line...still doesn't hold a candle to some of the awd gas cars.
Am I missing something or why this car couldn’t reach the top speed stated on the website?
Blimey, he's not hanging around!
Blimey, he's not hanging around!
269kph was as fast as I've seen !
That mf almost took flight a couple of times
Why is the Tesla speedometer and the one he has in front of him off by as much as 10km per hour?
That poor car, being pushed to do something that it's not meant for.
This is just awesome to watch.
Love it!
Incredible, though we need to hear the drivers post-circuit reflections, please! 🙂
I wonder when FSD will break the record. 🤔
I want one so bad
good Tesla
🔥
cool
That time is already as fast as a Nissan GT-R. Wow
That yoke makes me nervous to watch. The tire squealing shows driver continuously on edge of traction
I can’t understand why anyone would downvote this video?
Very impressive but if you get your hands on one in Europe (next year?) then please do not do this unless a skilled driver or get lessons, learn the track etc. - the dedication it takes to master the ring is serious work - most people do not have a 'hypercar' so they just crash and walk away mostly, not sure about a high-speed crash in this..
That was cool, I love the noise. I literally saw 268 on that thing!!!!! I feel like the boosters on the next roadster will change the physics. You might be able to get more traction in places where you would choose to lose some in order to get through the track quicker.
Well done tesla! Now we need. Cheaper cars! Where is the. Model "2?"?
why only 144p?
timeslip on Twitter Thursday night indicating the car lapped the nearly 13-mile-long circuit in 7:30.90, beating the Taycan by over 11 seconds.
I think what helped him set the record was the yoke.
Where's the WR auto pilot lap?  you know it would easily set one.
RIP steering wheel :)
Jesus
Supposed to brake before the turns, chicken.
The speed is in Km/h or MPH?
Good lord! Looks like the car is gonna launch itself into the trees any second! What a ride that must be!
Driver : sharp turns @100km/h Tesla : YESS YESS YESS
Reminds me of Knight Rider
very smooth ride
TBH, this car doesn't have proper racing suspension, this driver is not such a good racing driver, or both.  If you then still achieve a time of 7:35:579 is amazing.   The car does seem to drive slower at the end btw.
Congrats. Amazing time considering the weight of the car. Can't wait to see the Gen2 Roadster do the same.
Could the FSD with some ‘insanity tweaks’ do this lap better than a great driver is what I’m wondering right now…😂
Love being able to hear the turns and not so much the engine. Incredible!
Hi
144p Quality Lol
I think we need a computer assisted speed run next.
Yup. It's the one withou the speed limiter XD
Impressive... but not as much as how sticky the card holder is.
What I feel like every morning taking the kids to school late!
When will the Real Racing add Tesla
The more silent more concentration. But tires are making noise 🔊
even been in a tesla love all the noise
the stig driven electric cars? can we get em onboard
Steering wheel could used some improvements like the side can be just a little taller so you can grab onto them instead of having the wrap your hands all the way around the wheel or the yolk and I have not trust capacitive buttons on that thing like one of your hands slightly slips then you end up honking the horn probably ending up scaring the crap out of you turning on your turn signal in the middle of the road or unexpectedly activating the autopilot or cruise control normal buttons will be more practical because then you can move your fingers over them if necessary for comfort
Suddenly, racing became boring!
Had to check if I had 2x speed on, but I had 0.5X speed, WOW
Edmund: yoke is a joke.
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates. 🎈
Quand tu joue à Forza ou Gt avec les sons du moteur désactivé
That time looked under 7:40 so faster than taycan?
And then he dropped his kids off at school
wow 266 1:13 amazingly fast..... super fast pickup.... thanks for sharing!!!  I'll take 2 Model X please!!
I love u elon
Every time the Tesla accelerates it sounds like the power up sound of the proton pack in ghostbusters. Love it.
its like you are on the edge but still charging your phone
I wonder how the upcoming roadster will do...
Farfegnugen!
Look like a good dragster, but look like a tank cornering, poor tyres 😰
that's great driving...I wonder if auto-pilot will soon beat a human pro. That will be some AI test!
Things brings me back to old Gran Turismo days driving a Viper or GTR or 911 around this track, I don't remember the extra banked concrete slab turns though that must be new.
The 10 year old platform is really showing its age lol
I bet he was feeling brake fade carbon ceramic brakes are a must with a vehicle that weighs 4k pounds with 1000hp idk why tesla puts steel brakes at least make it an option. The Taycan Turbo S did a 7:35 with alot less power but it comes standard with carbon ceramic brakes meaning the driver had more confidence in the braking zones gaining lap time. I feel if the tesla had ceramic brakes you could easily shave another 5 or 6 seconds or more.
Man it hits different looking at a family sedan taking perfect racing lines.
If you let me buy this for Tether it will be my best purchase
f!
Fastest sedan in the planet.  World:  Holy Shit. What a bargain for beyond Bugatti preformance in a four Door?!?  Edmunds: not ground breaking just a new revision of an old car.
I think I'd want a round wheel, still.
First i thought it looks slow then i looked at the speedometer. Those number change so fast. 🙂
I’m convinced this is teslabot driving
Why is the driver wearing a fire suit? It's an electric car.
Looks absolutely terrifying. In a good way :)
If the old spied lap times clocked around 7:13 were the Plaid+ with 4680’s and the full 1200hp from the motors (and speed limiter removed), I can’t wait to see what’s next!
How about FSD? ^^
Looks so  unstable  i geuss  it looks like  that  with  that  steering wheel
Sounds like the car is "tire-limited" here and could go even faster with better rubber. I could be wrong.
How stick was this? Tyres? For a sedan this is amazing! Can’t wait to see the roadster do a lap, maybe with a wing.
Why are two speedometers show different speeds? 7:10 shows 267 vs 278
Those poor tires... Were running to the laws of physics here, acceleration, mass vs friction.
Put some wings on that and call it a plane.
How bad the rollercoaster is not working :-( That tesla looks amazing
So satisfying to watch. Well done Tesla team!
I love loud ice engines sounds, but these motors are awesome sounding. That’s a thing of beauty.
For sale, like new only 20ish miles on it
I used to drive like this in real racing 3.. :)
So for anyone wondering, this is why there is a yoke, this car is a beast
"Number 1, warp factor 9.......engage!!"  "Aye Captain."
69 last digits on the clock at the end. Nice job Elon
Great time for a common looking, 4 door sedan! 1. Where's the vbox data?  2. Did the timing go from Bridge to Gantry? 3. What was the SOC at the start, and at the finish?  4. What was the average whrs/mile over the length of the track? 5. Is this car modified in any way other than showroom stock? (Like the modified one that ran at Laguna Seca) (Update- apparently, just has a few safety mods) 6. Did this car run Tesla's stock compound, reduced tread tires? (Update- supposedly Michelin PS4s) 7. What would be the lap time if it did another lap? 8. How many laps can it complete at full tilt?
Nice run !!! cracked windshield?
Is the display in miles per hour or kilometers per hour? Either way, it's fast as fuck boiiiiii
imagine oversteering with the yoke
I want to see the car learn to drive itself around the track at these speeds. That would be amazing to see.
It's like travelling in bullet train. But why 2 speedometers? The car speedometer shows at max 277 while the extra one shows 266
bigre !
I really want to drive a Tesla and experience the Launch 🔥
Wow, Elon did a great job driving!!
Senti come chiedono pietà le gomme sotto quel peso
Looks unstable.... The germans will beat it in the corners.
probably feels like an airplane about to take off
Let’s ship it with a yoke to be different.
Is that a jet?
Now its officially a rally car👌
I love how it goes from slight under to slight oversteer after the apex
About as fast as Honda Civic Type R 🤣
this man look like he playing with WASD
Hadi be:)))
I like all tesla cars
That made my sack tighten. Nice Lap.
With this performance, still better fuel economy than Prius.
That was wild
Imagine if they added this car in GT7
Saw the clock hit 269. This is incredible. And the squeal of the tires!?!
Is the speedometer displaying km/h?
So embarrassing for all the old car manufacturers that the youngest, newest car manufacturer of all can do this. that's fast.
It has to be in km/h, but still impressive cornering speed for quite a heavy car. Also props to the driver!
#whoCares FYI, this is not a production tesla. They do modifications on them to achieve the best possible times. So you wouldnt be able to achieve that time if you bought a Model S Plaid.
US americans thinking this is mph must think this car is super fast lol
That things going quicker than our GT3 race cars up Kesselchen @3:53 🤯😅
The fact that you can hear the electronics is amazing. Also hope they put the same tires on the production Tesla.
Any questions?
Emotions=0
Was the top speed 270kph (167mph)?
just a few years ago EV's could barely make it around a lap. Tesla has come so far!
100 to 200kph is ridiculous , also I llove that he's casually charging his phone
0:01 you know it’s gonna be a nice vid from the start👏
So the car was still limited to 166ish mph.
Play this on 1.5x and you are in the Tesla roadster 💀🔥
They are cheating with 0-60, I'm sure they're somehow cheating here as well ;-)
For those of you wondering 260 kmh is 161.5 mph.....
Congrats! 🎉 Great time, even if it wasn't the aspired low 7-minute run. 7:06 I noticed the screens said 279km/h and 269 km/h - which means 167-173mph, slightly above what I've seen customers achieve. I had hoped the software update would be ready in time to set this record as it would've undoubtedly shaved off several seconds. Hope to see you try again next summer perhaps. Thanks for everything you do!
Fuck me that thing can shift.
Shit sounds like a fucking jet engine lol
Amazing
The speedometer … is that kilometers or miles per hour?
So strange when the car on that speed , ride without any noise roar from motor
Ok. Now gonna put earphones, play this video while sleeping. 👍🏼❤️
Kilometres right?
No V12? No drama? Go Tesla Go!!! Elon we love you!!!🤘🤘🤘🤘
I'm imagining a racing autopilot or full self driving. This was incredible driving, but the interesting thing is how jerky the steering looks as he reacts to the road. Makes me wonder if the perfect line would be almost completely smooth.
Elon my tires are gone!
who's the driver though?
omg...
1:26 I get the feeling that the steering input are just for show cause Tesla already decided how to take this corner hahahah
I find it odd that the "yoke" steering wheel isn't "fly-by-wire" like Infiniti active steering. A "fly-by-wire" system could make hundreds of steering corrections every second, and it would be less awkward to drive daily because it would never need to be turned all the way around. I think it would be advantageous on the track, too, because it could make multiple steering corrections in the time it takes the driver to even think about doing these corrections themself.
That driver is mad 🥶
Love Tesla but what's the reason for the difference between the display the driver is using and the one on the dash?
Excellent achievement but...  watch similar footage of cars that do a similar time or faster. The power and acceleration levels are amazing and indisputably dominant in a straight line but it's obvious from this that more work can be done on the chassis dynamics.  How hard the driver has to work at the wheel is the most significant indicator of that. It's clear that the chassis is still reacting in unpredicted ways the the driver is then having to make continuous corrections for. If that could be addressed, I'm sure that it would be as unbeatable on the 'Ring as on the dragstrips.
Shit :D
You can tell how heavy the car is by the way it goes around corners. Lots and lots of understeer, and more scrubbing of rubber than at a Fast and Furious drifting competition. The Plaid seems to blast down straights like a bat out of hell, then brute force bulldoze its way through corners, then fast on the straights again. I guess you can put as many tutus on a hippo as you want, it still won't be a ballerina. But man, can that hippo run fast in a straight line! Also, it's disappointing that Tesla put the center display into a static map mode, essentially hiding all the brake temperature and battery temperature data. That's a bit suspect. 🤔
He's really in a rush to deliver those styrofoam boxes of tomatoes in the back
was waitiing for the tesla to slide off the ttrack on some ofthose turnns wow
7;35  is a LOT slower than the lies floated a couple years ago, lol. Still a new 4 door vehicle record, just edging out the Porsche Taycan Turbo, assuming Tesla used stock hard production tires as did Porsche. We still haven't seen the Taycan Turbo S best time on the Ring, could be faster than 7;35... expect Porsche to respond with that run soon, now that they know what time to beat.
This guy nailed every shot. btw is the speed in kph or mph?
I read in a European journal that the actual difference is 16.7 seconds faster and not 12 than the taycan because Tesla used the longer track. Gotta love it!
how much charge did that use?
Poor tyres they must wear fast under that weight surely! 2162kg! Great straight line speed unreal! but a Porche GT2 RS does a 6:38 and the plaid does a 7:30 still a long way to go on handling, it looks like a right handful this driver has some balls that's for sure
Amazing feel
It would be amazing if Tesla created a photorealistic simulation of this track for any S3XY owners to virtually race on the center display and compete for a leaderboard!
almost a minute slower than nio ep9  lap time of 6:45 sec
"but look at all those interventions! FSD is crap!"
top speed 270 😮😮😮
Looks very hairy
Yeah Baby! 😝😍💕👍😚😋💨🥰
Time to remove the driver
Man this one is fast super fast 🤯
Completely stock with the yoke…. Can’t wait for Unplugged upgrades!
What would it take to make it faster ? Better suspension, better steering, better tires more power ?
First car where tires makes more sound than Engine :D
Lets be clear this is a great time for a production car. Let me correct that the best time for a production car. Every other record I seen talks about how they modfied said cars to make those super fast lap times. While this is what you get when you buy the car. This is far better than pretty much every other super car on the market. Buy it today and put down a 7 min and 30 second something lap if you have the balls.  Elon Musk Tweet.  Tesla Model S Plaid just set official world speed record for a production electric car at Nurburgring. Completely unmodified, directly from factory.
The straight are lit 🔥
Muito louco 💪💪👏👏👏✌️✌️✌️
the display should show "don't panik"
Now do it on autopilot.
Easily hitting 120 around the corners is Fing crazy🤯  Claps to the driver 👏👏
The Yoke looks really uncomfortable in this scenario, he cant place his thumbs anywhere except a spot where he cant fully grip it.
Boy that supercharger screams so good.
260++ and so silent unbelievable
is that Mph or Kmh???
Nice 💯💯💯
This driver is amazing.   The amount of steering/yoke input freaks me out but look at the right side if the screen and it’s super smooth. Skills
Clearly 200mph wasn't unlocked..
So is this with or without track mode. If not  I see another record when track mode comes out
Now this is my kinda ASMR...
That's slow for a 1000hp car.
This left me wondering if Elon Musk Tesla AI will be able to learn the driving skills of a professional driver. If once the track was driven, the car would be able to perform the same task adequately.
The moment of inertia of the yoke seems too low. Awesome otherwise.
Samir, Samir, you're breaking the car!
Holy smokes that steering wheel is stupid
Ganz neues Fahren!   Fahren nach Quietschgeräusch der Reifen!!! Bei Verbrennern nicht möglich!  Aber das Lenkrad ist eine Krankheit! Damit würde ich nie rumfahren wollen! Erstrecht nicht auf speed! Jemand eine Idee was über der Geschwindigkeit hochgezählt wurde? Irgenwas mit Bremse vielleicht?
I guess the yoke work for him. What will all  never drove it yoke hater say now ?
Highest speed I saw was 270kph/167mph. Is this car still being limited in top speed? Definitely an impressive run. I just would have expected 180+ on the big straights.
Just the sound of wind and slight electrical motor noise (out of the turns). . . Amazing!
I wonder how fast Tesla could get this Plaid around the 'ring' with just auto pilot
Those poor tyres earned their place in history... ssqqqqqquuuuuuueeeeeaaaalllllllllllllllllllll
What tires?
You can see with the naked eye that they got much less experience than Porsche. But that means they will only get faster
Tesla: sets world record Edmonds review: "ehh that's a waste of money"
Forza Motorsport player here
The thing literally sounds like a spaceship when it accelerates. How are there hundreds of dislikes?!
Robert Kubica would do better timing! :D
i swear to God , i can hear Sabine Laughing her fool head off, ...
You need a smoother driver. I suspect there was time left on the track. You can do better. Or even better how about some good tires?
So is 7:45 the time? Also amazing footage and amazing car
this beats the cool model x doors omggg i want one
Still faster than Mazepin
#TSLA sounds like a spaceship!!! I wonder why...🤔
this is great, it must piss off alot of car heads😂 this is the future people no stupid engines making noise and people revving the shit out of Ford Focus at tesco parking lot
Their goes one trick pony.
Amazing!!
I see... Self driving is taught to drive on the Autobahn at normal speeds... Good!
He was driving EV's before it was cool and was said to have driven one out of his mother's womb. But to the rest of us he's only known by one name.... The Stig.
turn on the engine, please. I can't hear the engine!
Why do Mercedes and Porsche not use full cages when setting production lap records?
speed is impressive. I rewatched the tacan hot lap https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m31EgQkswg&t=1s which is ~10s slower and it is interesting to see the difference in steering inputs through the course. Not sure how much is the driver style/technique but the model S seems like it is much harder to handle and needs much more aggressive steering control
They build a monster.
The most boring thing i've ever seen in my life.... Motorsport Is dead
not noisy enough
Just hearing the wheels screeching is no fun 😑
honey
If this is production car, then it has 165mph speed limiter in place. There are at least 3 sections where it can go much faster than 165mph. Redo the run without the limiter.
how does anyone thumbs down this video? it is just raw.
Some say he charges his Tesla with a diesel generator... All we know is he's called The STIG.
Kph or mph?  All of a sudden it was going 269 on main stretch without even trying. *Driver takes a sip.
skrt skrt
This is the track that leads from the mining location to home base and they’re escaping the fiery jaws of a Martian lava snake. Go! Go! Go!
oh yes.
CHEATING! He's got the minimap he can see the next turn in advance!!
Who's driving it, and what was the previous record (and by what car)?
Sabine Schmitz would have got it done in sub 7:30 😉
It shows a bit of a problem with electric cars racing. Lots of oversteer because of the weight.
I want to know about the brakes? Still a heavy car, but even faster acceleration. The brakes may be the real hero at the track.
now should tesla unlock the top speed for this car😣😫😫😫😓
cool as hell
Too heavy with constant screeching. Bad handling as well. Comparatively the Taycan honestly looked like walk in the park. I can easily see Taycan Turbo S breaking this record very soon.
what kind of tires is on the car?
Once you remove that software limit for the speed you will be able to kill those straights!  Easily be able to cut that time down! Love it.
Haha bring on the Rimac……
Not a driver, so not able to feel the speed in the video, is that KP/h or MP/h that we see above the yoke?
Whats the little red thing by his leg?
Congratulations. Pity it couldnt go up to 300km/h in the last straight road like the M5, and pilot not confident in curve, you'd easily beat the time
Just engage autopilot.
Very fast. Can’t wait to see it perform in a chassis that is built to race rather than this sedan.
Where is the Knight Rider Melody?. 😄
Alien technology
I want to see FSD do this... after a few runs should be able   beat the humans handily.
That Sound makes me Go nuts
heavy, bouncy air suspension, awkward steering wheel, poorly performing brakes, and electronically limited top speed; this car needs a sports package option.
Meh now let’s see AP crush this in race mode.
This driver jerks the wheel a lot.  Is that normal?
Seems like the Plaid overheated at the end. „Only“ 277km/h
Saw 265 on the speedometer so I'm assuming that's in kph so 164 mph. Is this the top speed right now? Was this done on factory tires or racing tires? If either, they probably need to be replaced!
Autopilot version please
amazing
Why is driver in fireproof suit?
I love how silent are electric engines
Sound is good
Would be nice to see an interview with the pilot,  just a few questions about the feelings and things like that.
Me watching this:   “damn I left YouTube on 1.5x speed” *checks settings* “Holy shit this is playing at normal speed.”
My wife getting on and off the freeway is more entertaining than watching this dude go right,  go left & go straight.
Speed limiters on?
What's missing???  Well the awe inspiring scream of a turbocharged v 12!!!  The glory of nailing the tune up...  What's missing in the Tesla???  Well if you want to call arguing over how many pounds of air to put in the tires a tune,,then it's kind of like getting a trophy for showing up for the race!!!
Wow.  Yes, God Damn Tesla ..... you have no friend at any track to play with.... lol
Lol panamera turbo s is 6s faster with 400hp less, and a cayenne turbo is 3s slower and its a suv 😑
What mods to the car?
If the Model S did this Can't imagine what will the Roadster do🔥🔥🔥
Is it broken ??? No V8 Sound
Nah, no thanks. No emotion whtsoever.
The max speed I seen and I'm not sure if it was Kph or Mph was 269 on the straight away.
atleast now will now....how hard tiers work
Wow!
Lol that Edmunds 'review' yoke unusable huh? 😂 Hypercar specs at that price - bravo Tesla and the team!
Insane! I’m literally trying to get myself in a position so I can buy my wife the model X. She gave me 3 beautiful baby girls and already 10 amazing years of her life. She deserves the world.
Lol you can tell this car is not made for cornering! the tyres and screaming for help and the steering is very unsettled.
On veux le même interieur noir sur nos modele 3
I wonder if human drivers are becoming the limiting factor. Can FSD do better lap times?
Sub-eight minutes? You must be yoke-ing?
There is a noticeable difference in speed readings on the actual speedometer and the custom one. Original one showing higher speeds!
That steering wheel is a show stopper.
Hells bells that’s insane
I think of my corvette as a horse now. Age of ice is over.
LOL and he did it with the YOKE!!!!! What does Edmund and all them yoke haters have to say about this???
It's one of the best car in the world.
why the difference in the speedometer reading?
The yoke is so awkward by looking and to be used      In my opinion
Goes to show how wack it's handling is
He wont be able to put reverse with gloves on lol
What kind of shit is this steering wheel? Maybe with a real steering wheel the driver could improve the lap time!
Proof that the steering yoke works really well and fits this car. It cleared not make the car undrivable. Lol
This looked extremely uncomfortable and dangerous to me. And no it's not about the speed.
It's an interesting change just hearing the tyre (tire) screech and next to no engine noises
shite car
This driver certainly knows how to handle this beast better than that guy over at Edmunds.
Congratulations on the world record!!!
kph or mph?
Mph or kmh ?
Camerawork is underrated af, shakes are so minimal even over bumps
Nice driving, that "stearing-wheel" should be optional.
This car never fails to amuse me on how it picks up speed
nice rc car 😴
What is that thing on the steering column?
I hope that Roadster will be nearer to  Porsche 911 GT2 RS (6:40.3) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsGpFTJMd0k
Imagine how much faster it would have gone without that gigantic set of balls weighing it down.
This is without the unlocked top speed. It'll have better lap times with a 200mph top speed
What's the record for the Lamont 24hrs? I think if elon gets the super charger under 2.5 secs for a full charge it's over.
One of those speed read outs are inaccurate. I wonder why that is
Grats!!! Yet, conveniently, VW owned frededtrek site forgot to include this feat.
Who’s driving?
I'm a PPL pilot, and this lap looks like taken from the fighter jet!!! Amazing car, but the driver is just phenomenous!!! Fighting for grip while accelerating this beast, this is marvelous!  But the best is audio: I just love the sound of silence, no more roaring ICE engines. Their age have past! And I'm participating in this revolution by voting with my money and buying Tesla model 3 LR! I have it 3 months and I love it!
Watching at 2x speed looks like a hyper or timelapse.
Those ripple strips are nice haha
Didn’t Elon claim unmodified? This video here shows something different then
This is amazing, spaceship rocket feels.
he tweakin
just need to get the weight down. the tyres are getting shredded
Sounds like an airplane ✈️ taking off and landing at the same time.
I expected a much better time.. Even Audi RS3 and Cayenne Turbo GT did better.
This makes my hands sweat.
Wonderful 😊. The speed is  kph or mph ?
Just beautiful
Almost a perfect car if not for it strange steering wheel, this driver clearly a pro. Let's put some avarage joe on it and go for a lap, let's see how he do it. 😁
Le pisa el nota....
Essentially, it's a time of 300bhp, $40k hot-hatches, not a $130k+, 1000bhp monster. I'm strongly disappointed.
Samir you're breaking the car
i was expecting it to be faster for some reason
Ei huono!
That was beautiful.
was expecting a better nurburgring time tbh
For that price I would expect the whole steering wheel
Warp 9 please, commander.
No battery overheating???? No deactivated battery safety features?
Insane
Nice! That yoke looks absolutely terrible to use on track though.
With that yoke steering wheel, it looks like it has a lot of play in it.  Makes me nervous just watching it.
About to become the most watched Tesla video ever, great driver
Only 7:35:579, 6:05.336 was the time for the fastest electric car a VW ID R. Can't wait to see the Lotus Evija top Tesla at least it will handle so much better. Tesla crashed on previous attempts. Was the same car used? Looked like a barely controlled crash the entire way round.
Fast and boring 💤
ох, это здорово! отличный автомобиль
Who was the driver, btw?
Was that JayLeno driving?
Great, but you can see the weight of the car
easter egg: that is Elon behind the wheel. 😎
If it didn't have speed limiter, it could have taken more time off!
Incredible footage with best BGM ever 🔥
Who was the driver? Was it Randy? I see noone take the Karusel like that. Maybe it's the perspective, or your driver knows more / less about that track than what we are used too. I bet with more time on the banking and a normal steering wheel he could have been 3-6 sec faster.
Looking forward to a lap with just the autopilot in full auto race mode!
It is good that he has large navigation :D
For reference, best Nurburgring lap time for a production car is 6:38 by  Porsche 911 GT2 RS MR, and all top 10 times are less than 7 minutes, and the tesla with 7:35 won't even be in the top 50, but this is a heavy car and it performed amazing for its weight, it's almost Nissan GTR performance! Hopefully with the new tesla roadster, we will see the tesla motors being used to their full potential.
What a ride! <3 The Porsche Taycan was 7:42. Somehow I expected the S Plaid to be faster than 7:35 based on comparing raw specs between the two cars. Guess the Taycan handles better? Anyway, congrats to Team Tesla - warp speed fast! And man, those accelerations, watching the speedometer was almost as exciting as watching the surroundings blazing by.
Is this km/h or mph?
Wooooo !!!!! What's the tire temp ??? lol...
6:38.84 is the time to beat at Nürburgring. Show that a production car can win against tuned cars. Go Tesla!
A-MAZ-ING! Sounds are everything. Anyone knows what brand is the race dashboard display?
that's nuts!
What was the used tires?  PS4S ?
Impressive.
Not really impressive if you consider that for example the Taycan took only 7 seconds longer but is waaay down on HP (1020 vs. 750).
Amazing, but people are sharing pics saying the brakes are not stock.  Is this true?
**sees insane car breaking lap record**  **instinctively turns up volume**   ***slowly turns volume back down***
That's the sound of death rushing toward him are you by chance joking my man? 😬
Anyone else love the fact that there are 2 phones charging as he's destroying the record!!!
😍 Die Zukunft kann kommen...
2 words:  BONE Fucking Stock!
I remembered when I was kid, in car chase movies they'd add extra tire noise in post production to make the pursuit more intense. Little did they know that it will be how the real car of the future will sound like.
waiting when it will beat that in self-driving mode)
Police forces, take note!
Those are kilometers right?...
Let the AI drive!!
wow.
Nice sedate 'family' car...out for a Sunday morning run to the shops.
Epic
3:36 R.I.P lil bug. Never saw it coming.
What was the lap time?
Terrifyingly fast
surprised the car dont go over 300 in the final straight line
The video ends when his speed reaches 69
Volkswagen Golf GTI Clubsport S - 7:47:19
Can you change those tires? Those tires making excessive noise.
got to be hard to avoid an accident with this much power, it sounds like a plane taking off on the straightaways.
Tire screeching and space ship noises 😂
I bet it could do faster run once they remove speed limiter
I'm proud of the time record but man this was boring 😂😭
Its kp/h right?
Could have hired someone quicker
I love those drive unit and inverter sounds! Love them in my 3 as well. Like a spaceship ;-).
Only 267 kph as the topspeed?
lol at the cracked windshield. I've busted 3 on my M3 and 2 on my MY. Looks like Plaid is no different
nice plaid speed ring lap! those tires were tortured, plaid is a heavy one!
Sets a 7:35 on the Nurburgring while wirelessly charging his phone. That has to be a record in and of itself.
So I'm confused. Did they set a fastest time of 7:35.5 or a 7:30.9 (as mentioned by Elon on Twitter).
I want a car like this! can you give it to me?
This car is not user friendly for that driver 😂 tilting steering many times
And with this ends James May's interest in the Model S Plaid.
wahooooo
Awesome 👏
Yes but can it drive itself on the Nurburgring?
Props to the driver for taming the beast
Ah now the yoke makes sense
Proof it's only quick in a fast line... 7:35? Lol. Pretty damn bad
Elon's tweet has both this time, 7:35.579 AND a time of 7:30.909.  According to Electrek, those were two different lap times.  Unknown if they were back-to-back or not.  The Porsche Taycan overheated on its second lap when it ran 7:42 in August 2019 when they claimed “fastest four-door, all-electric sports cars” record.
A very interesting piece of information would be to see what the Tesla computer does to help the driver when cornering and braking.
Holy fucking shit
How many kWh's did that lap consume? :)
How i drive to get coffee in the morning
Why didn't he go balls out on the last straight? And if it has a limiter on it then why would it for a Nurburgring test?
Speed is in km / hr ... right?
Looks like it would be so much easier with a steering wheel.
I liked it.
I don’t know what to say , wow grate job Tesla
Autonomie ? 😂
4:27, steering column is modified for 270 deg lock  you won't be able to do this in your road tesla
Warum nicht im FSD Mode… Wieviele Runden schafft der Fahrer und der Akku bei derartiger Belastung? Bekomme schon Angst nur vom zuschauen.
Guess that yoke is functional after all
Impressive, but what's all that squeaking in the inside? It sounds like a rally car with a stripped-out interior....but this is supposed to be a standard car, right?
Sheeeeeshh
is that km/h or mph?
Whahahha, helmet and gloves, but no roll bar and at the end the battery died. He probably was afraid to also loose track, as he had his navi turned on.   Tesla isn't a race car.
Who is the driver?? He gets bragging rights for a lifetime.
This is why tesla is just on another level. This is a normal car!! Except it isn't
What are those two custom bargraphs measuring above the steering wheel?
If Porsche decide to uncork the Taycan, although it'sneedlessly heavy, they may do a similar time. To be farit to Tesla, they intend to set top speed higher. A second or two to be won right there. Did anyone compare mimimum speeds with Taycan Turbo S?
I’d be sick to see a Tesla do this autonomously one day in the future.
amazing, congrats!!  Now let's get that top speed unlocked...  :)
Guarantee it would’ve been faster with a normal steering wheel as it offers the driver much better control. The yoke sucks on street and especially on track driving. Randy Pobst confirmed as much when he required them to switch the yoke out of his Plaid track car at Laguna Seca.
And this was with the software limited max speed, and other limitations that can be easily lifted. And in case the haters didn't notice, this is a 5 door family sedan with the best charging network on the planet, safest car ever released, beats a Bugatti Chiron in acceleration and 1/4 mile, best FSD, only car maker to have real OTA, has a massive trunk and a frunk, best infotainment system in the world all for half the price of the obsolete Taycan and half the TAXES of the usless Chiron. The mind BOGGLES.
Not a car adapted for racing. Do not do this in other places unless closed racing circuits.
It seems the driver didn't get a whole lot of laps to work up to this. Braking looks very early and shakey. In many places the exit was slow and throttle late, acceleration blistering but short and the top speed not all that impressive for a 1000 hp car. Fox Hole 50 kph slower than a GT2RS MR with passenger. The driver is busier keeping it between the barriers rather than letting the hyper power loose.
This was great… now imagine the roadster…
See, even they need the speedometer right above the steering wheel, not off to the side on the display
Working for every inch of traction!
Seeing i went heaven and came back... 😂
Porsche fanboys on suicide watch...
Congrats to Tesla! Now you made a 1000hp car that is only 35 seconds slower than a 500hp Porsche 992 GT3.
Take this sucker to La Mon
While charging two phones. lol.
That's Numberwang.
Even if I could I’m not nearly brave enough to drive like this
Just a casual 240
No time?
Next comes the AI speed lap.
Next step: do that with auto pilot 😂
I'm getting anxious watching it turn. It looks like it's gonna hit a wall 😭
Она на столько БЫСТРАЯ, что у меня даже видос не прогружается
Push it to the limit
Wow! 268km/h at the end!
Fantastic! come in my channel to look what i do!
What was the time ? He drove a little Bit to hard over the curbs but yes the car is very heavy
The sound of Acceleration and gripping is excellent.... but what bothers me is the differnce is values of the two speedometer...the change of values are constant but there is always a difference of 5~10 kmph between the two values
Espectacular
Engine sounds great
Would love to know some stats, i.e starting and finishing SOC, also I see its still limited to 155. And how was your arm pump at the end 🤔 💪😂
Excuses flying already! Now the haters see it can handle and be driven at the limit with the yoke. To be in denial is a pitiful state. Sucks to be them. 🤣🤣🤣
Lots of tire squeal, I'm wondering if they used appropriate tires, Wikipedia lap times shows only (Michelin) for type.  The top lap times cars used (Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 R) tires.  The Fastest lap time by Porsche 911 GT2 RS, had very little (tire squealing) compared to the Plaid run.   If Tesla used the (Pilot Sport Cup 2 R) tires maybe their lap time would improve.  And, top speed of 268 km/hr seems conservative considering the 911 GT2 RS top speed was 310 km/hr.   I hope Tesla runs it again with the Pilot Sport Cup 2 R tires and push it.
Yokeotta be kidding me! This is so sick!!! 🚀💪 Go Tesla!!
Sweet as Fuck!! I want to Redline a Tesla Roadster on that Track!!
Superchargers are at the Ring?
so amaze acceleration
Please bring Tesla to South Africa!! I don't want a petrol car🤢🤢
Wow. That is so amazing
So awesome great work Tesla !!!!!
Nice!
And it wasn't even a perfect lap. Incredible car!
Sounds like it's going into warp drive on the straights, unbelievable.
This is why you need Yoke
Feel like I am in a spaceship
8 seconds faster than a Civic. That is fast :)
Steering wheel bullshit
Now they should do the same lap with a circular steering.
Incredible. TESLA TAKEOVER IS HERE. One car to rule them all 😀💪👏🚀🏎
Not sure how much prescribe the driver needed with that rectangle steering.
I see they didn't unlock the top speed of 200mph.
Can I please get this version of driving for my FSD subscription
Fantastic result for a family 4door sedan, I love the philosophy of car without limits in its form.
Bruh that tesla hit 180+
Official lap record according to who? There is a slew of other records much faster than 7:35 for production vehicles.
Slower than an Audi RS3 lul
best ASMR ever <3
Is this K/ph or M/ph ?!
Seems like some time could be made up with the speedlimiter removed...👀
Looks like a job for FSD now that it's learned the track.
Last name ever  First name greatest Like a sprained ankle Tesla Ain't Nothing To Play With👊💪🚀🇺🇲
Sound like a spaceship going Plaid
The tyres !!
A preview of Electric GT racing - Thanks Tesla!!! 😎
Dead engine, no brakes and Great driver. That's what it looks like to me. 😅
now do it on autopilot
Next step, new best time with FSD.
Amazingly fast. Too much squeak and rattle in the chassis
Seeing how he whipps this heavy sedan at that speed around the track is quite amazing. Interesting how thay used a separate dash, instead of the weird built in. Then again, nobody buys a Tesla for its design, interior or exterior.
so when will tesla make its first Electric race car?
That electric motor hum almost sounds like a turbo charger!
i would not risk driving it that fast, its not a fucking racecar
That was really good , there is defiantely more in it. Just trying to keep it on the road seems to be the struggle , some treaks to the setup and the driver can get more from it.
sounds very strange, but it is hardly normal at those speeds
Might I add that this is a full size family sedan with hatchback capabilities
That stupid steering wheel is going to cause a lot of fatal accidents.
Awesome! What about in autopilot?
wonder how much these drivers get paid. any performance incentive as well?
Who's the driver?
Good to see one of you actually drive this car to its fullest extent... I hate to see this car driving and not hearing the tires chirping on the track.
It's a heavy pig, for sure.. you can see it fighting the grip....always remember this when on ice, ok peoples?
Felt like i was there all 8 mins. Just amazing. Perfect car. Great driving.
My 1st Tesla video of the day.  What a great way to start a new day.
The speedometer vs stock is off by 10km/hr 🤔
Imagine if the driver was better also, no so much spinning, could be some very hot laps.
the squeaking sound of the seats is unbearable /s
Love it ❤️
It can only go like 267… with an update 325
Is the speedometer in MPH or KPH?
a 2000kg car with a low 7 minute lap time@ the ring is impressive! With this package of engines and new battery technology, Tesla can make a roadster that weighs 1500 kg and has much better roadholding....uuuuh 6 minutes round the ring should still be feasible for a professional ring driver?
Brave driver, braver tyres
"Ev's are slow and boring" Tesla creates the world's fasted car (and it's electric) "The plaid is only good at drag racing" Tesla does a record lap time at Nürburgring. "The Yoke is a joke" Me watching this video and thinking, hmm? ok Teslaq'rs, what's the next thing you're going to complain about?
Apart from the speed what was the bolt on screen in front of the yoke showing?
How fast do cars normally go around this track?
Insane
The acceleration from 100 to 200 is real impressive. And he is charging his phone.
I love that high pitched whirring sound during acceleration 😍
what's up with the screen in front of the original instrument screen? You even cut the steering wheel to make it "perfect"! Like every tesla, even this one needs aftermarket parts to make it work! LOL
I have been waiting so long, this is amazing
I wonder if it would have been easier with a steering wheel. 🤔
I wonder if the steering 'wheel' actually helps or worsens the driving experience. Idk seems kinda scary to go almost 300kph with something looking like that.
so its almost as fast as an M5... with half the horsepower...  and 12 seconds slower than an AMG gt63s which also has half the power (and ALOT more luxury)...  these electric cars are insane at drag racing... but they just never quite measure up on track!  all 3 cars were tested with Michelin pilot sport 4's with slightly different times
That's lucid performance..
Slower than an m5 cs.
Big Bada Gahooners
Not gonna lie, expected a quicker time for a 1020 bhp awd electric car. Have cars with nearly half the bhp and similar weight that are quicker.
mph ? kmh?
7:11 difference between speedometers are 10 kmh?🤔 278 kmh 268 kmh
That's KPH, right? RIGHT??
The guy driving knows his car man
It ranked above a BMW M5 and a Nissan GT-R, nice...
?
Big 👍 for the driver doing this with the yoke wheel.
"You gotta turn right to go left" I think I get it now.
Is the speedometer in MPH?
If you're not first you're last.
So Edmund's, tell me again how the yoke is dangerous for everyday driving?
Absolutely amazing to see something so fast be so quiet in a straight line. Love the tire screeching in the turns though.
You can definitely feel the cars weight in the corners
That there is some mind-blowing engineering.
And the time was……………………
I nearly fell out of bed watching this!
People will pretty soon look at ICE cars the way the ICE car fans look at hose carriages. And the way we look at ICE car fans... :-) What's the story behind the crack in the windshield?
Forget the lap time, forget everything. this is soulless and I take no argument on it. I mean compare this video with that one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nblOLdCUzA0&t=176s&ab_channel=sportauto Again... it is not about the lap time... forget about that. Which one looks more exciting to you???
See, yoke is totally fine.
Sound of the future is amazing!
looks heavy
Very good$$$$$
Wow
KITT is kind of quiet guy.
Jesus
I'll gotta admit, i like the 919 more, but that's a whole different class of car
An M5cs is faster on Nurburgring
Impressive
thank God for the air and tire squeal or else you'd think this was recorded on mute...
Who’s the driver?
Nürburgring! all cars go ZUUUUUUUUUUUUm
S I C K
Is that mph or kph?
I will never use an electric cars...They boring as hell 😴😒
So I scrolled to a the end and see 266. Started watching from the beginning
Yoke steering wheel needs to die! It doesn't even provide handle grip,he just holds it from the upper part! 👎
That steering wheel looks so unsafe
From what I saw looked to be a 7:33. I wish they had disabled the speed limiter for the run.
Love hearing that “warp drive” engage!
That’s wild
Elon tweeted they use a Tesla model s plaid which is Completely unmodified, directly from factory. And next they will use a  modified Plaid with added aero surfaces, carbon brakes & track tires (all things that can be done without Tesla being in the loop)
Oooooops
At least give the guy a full steering wheel to hang on to!
Is that a crack in the windscreen?
Make it autonomously race without the driver next time ! bet it is gonna set a much lower lap time !
battery life and temps would be interesting at that pace.
Lost a lot of time on the big straights with the 267 kph/ 160 mph limiter
As everyone says once they test it here the car is all but ruined 😂😭
getting there, but still slower than an alfa giulia Q from 2016 with 500hp?
It's sound wierd when all u can hear is the wheel. Amazing
Tesla! Tesla! Tesla!
So, as this isnt the fastest time well yeah its not a race car. But DAMN! For a family luxury sedan this competes with the best of the best hyper cars. This is crazy!
Impressive. Fast. Silent.  Now: Put in KW coil overs, a nice aero package, stickier Michelin rubber and liberate some more top end speed and you will gain another 20-30 seconds...still running as silent as a submarine.
Purely mesmerizing! It's like a jet on the ground! So eerie...so powerful. Unnatural *beast* !
Nice, but he could have been faster! ...also how he took the carussel was not good for the car ;-)
That’s why I love this model look at that speed and acceleration!
The way that speedo goes up plus the sound👌
That yoke looks right where it’s supposed to be
To slow
Still far away from the Jaguar XE SV Project 8 time of 7:23
It took 2 years to beat the slower Taycan by 11.4 seconds.  Hopefully Tesla can get the top speed up to the full spec of the Plaid (200 mph), should be able to gain a couple more seconds on the long straight and take out a few more ICE records like the Panamera.
how much kWh is needed for 1 lap?
The driver has nice lines.
“Some say that the outline of his left nipple is exactly the same shape as the Nurburgring, and if you give him a really important job to do, he’ll skive off and play croquet.”
this lap time is a minute slower than the porsche 911 that set the record , this tells me that this tesla plaid although quick handles like garbage
Germany rocks!
Beat the Taycan! Slightly disappointed it ended up being 8 seconds slower than the current 4-door record (AMG GT 63s). Still looking slightly faster than the M5 competition, which means it'd be #5 on the fast sedans list on the Nürburgring. Now if it gets a track package with upgraded brakes and suspension, I wonder how much faster they'll be. Edit: wait... it's also the first Tesla do so a full lap without overheating! Their cooling tech really has come a long way.
Crazy: only tires and winds sound. ASMR stuffs?
Its reminds me a bit of my wife driving our Model S 90D to the shops..
Why is the top speed so low? and the acceleration over 200 km/h? - was't expecting that from Plaid...
The top end is still limited. Once it is unlocked and the track pack installed I am sure it will go quicker.
Forza horizon!?
Dang you can tell it’s heavy just by watching him drive. I wonder how much understeer he is dealing with.
Tesla Model S Plaid. The drivers car.
The sound is insane.
Tesla sets new Record time.
That's a whole lotta tire noise.
268 or 269 km/h top speed?   we see the 9 for 100ms, I guest it counts.
Tee best 😇
be good if you gave us more information is it KLM/HR or MP/HR ?
Pucker, pucker, pucker....
Now that's how you handle a yoke!... cc: Edmunds
87th fastest streat legal car around the track. Thought it would be faster!
For a car with over 1000hp and acceleration rivaling high performance race cars, you'd expect it to be faster than this lmao.
Would the Plaid get better times with a steering wheel?   vs the Yoke 🤔
Amazing!!! i love that Track, Amazing Driver and Car! Just Amazing!
I would love to see AI drive this. It could probably shave off a couple of seconds. Beautiful lap tho!
Love the car, what do you do for a living?
tesla in F1 when
who is the driver?
I white knuckled that whole video.. well done
The torque steer is hilarious to watch, that plaid has too much power
Can’t wait to see late game when he unlocks the rest of the steering wheel.
What remains a ridiculous duel, car TESLA system output: 1,020 hp (about 760 kW) vs PORSCHE Taycan system output: 625 hp (about 460 KW). 300 KW more for 12 seconds less, 25 KW/s  :-))
Done with the Yoke. Epic run
Uffffff Elon Baba yine yargı dağıtmış.
Impressive
Yeah Sebastian Vittel!!!!
What suspension setup, tires?????
Its not a good track car looking at the footage, but it is fast though
J'aimerais pas être dans la voiture !!!  🤢🤢🤢
250 like its no biggie
It sounds like a fcking spaceship, that's insane !
this car is insane
сотона
Excellent Sound Its like Gtr Sound Like This Sound🥰🤩🥵
RIP legacy auto
would be cool if there were a special maps mode when you're on any track
That looked crazy difficult to drive. The weight combined with the lack of downforce made it look like a handful under breaking and coming out of the corners.  Kinda confused how this is the fastest time for a production electric car, isn't the nio ep9 like a minute faster?
Why did he only get to 270 km/h on the straight if the top speed is over 300km/h?
Normal steering wheel = -5 seconds. It is literally falling out of his hands :D
楽しいぃな〜
Nice car but stupid yoke, I can see each and everyone driving these cars are straggling to manage the steering yoke -yaks - jokes 🚘👍
This lap was faster than a one maked by an Audi R8, Lamborghini Murcielago, Mercedes AMG GT, Nissan GTR, Bugatti Veyron.
I love how quick it accelerates!!
12 Seconds faster than the Tycan bone stock... and they said it couldn't complete a lap without over heating.
211 Lucid air Executives down voted this video.
5:28 - the sound I would make sitting inside that monster every single turn)))
I’m assuming those were stock tires?
Defying physics. Tesla needs to develop new tires next.
WTF is this? The man either does not know how to drive or the car behaves like a complete shit under these circumstances. It is like Moby Dick on wheels...
Try it on autopilot!!
Holy shit!!!
Holy understeer batman.  This thing would be nuts with some competent suspension work and better tires.
Driver was probably STOMPING on the brakes for the car to slow down🤣unfortunately this car will never set a world record 😑
That's just a bit slower than a G80 M3 - quite impressive Tesla! 100 - 200 km/h is insane on this car. Does anybody know what tires this car was on? Any modifications other than the display, seat, harness?
James May would like to have a word with you.
Bloody hell that fast
This is like me driving to the liqueur-store when it's closing in 2 minutes
Where's the telemetry?
What tires does the plaid come with?
the creaking made it sound really lame
Must be pretty scary to drive a car that weighs that much but also accelerates as fast as a race car.
Well we know it can accelerate but can it corner? Get some really sticky Hoosiers on it is might be able to.
Excellent speed, shock absorbers feels too  soft...IMHO
JFC‼️ This is amazing,! but keep it on a track, or add a set of wings, so i can fly the hell off this planet! 😍😜
I'm definitely gonna buy this track to my backyard. I'll consider the car too.
good car /
When the video ends, the speed is 69mph. I refuse to believe this was an accident 😂😂
For such a big heavy car this is impressive. Would love to see the state of the tyres after a lap like this ‐ it sounds like a torture test for them!
Good marketing for the yoke 👌
Sauschnell! Tesla entwickelt sich einfach weiter.
What’s the lap time?
Is that in km/h or mph. ???
The yoke doesn't look safe!
It is completely stock?
Is it limited to 266kph/165mph? I can’t wait to see it after an update allowing 200mph!
Crazy to think this is a 4-door sedan
wow...
Can Tesla made a F1 car in the future?
The sound of gas cars dying <3
So cool and I really want one but to be honest nothing beats the sound of the Corvette 6.2 V8
This is 1;03 less than fastest gasoline lap time by porsChe  911 Gt2 RS by driver lars kern😒😒  Do Not a thing to exaggerate 😒😒
Anyone know what tires were used?
The acceleration is impressive, but in the corners it looks like a tank trying to corner. The driver is doing an amazing job to keep this on the track, but he is struggling with understeer in every corner. It is just pointless to even try this with the standard car. I am sure the brakes are not standard, the tires are definitely track tires, and there is a cage inside the car. Oh, and I hate that stupid steering wheel, I wonder how many times he would have turned on the wipers or the lights if Tesla wouldn't have disabled the buttons.
Is the acceleration sound synthetic or is that how the motor actually sounds?
20 kwh per mile brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Whay you don’t show the outside, so we can see non factory brakes, and suspension
That Teslabot is impressive
@tesla can you do this without a human driver? hopefully much faster and smoother
zzzZzzZzzZzzZzzzz
damn, the audio reminds me of Elite dangerous.
good to know a porsche tycan turbo is still quicker
JOKE ON THE YOKE HATERS!
Would love to have seen Sabine do this.
7:45 for a big heavy car like that is amazing
that's fucking fast !
Love this and I know with some minor tweaks the Plaid S could go even faster at the Ring!
La máxima velocidad fueron 268 kilómetros por hora o millas?
Now THATS what I call Insane Mode!
I need fake engine sounds installed if I get a tesla, this is anticlimactic
7:07 max speed 269 km/h ? its nurburgring limitation? Plaid max speed is 320, isn't it?
Why it looks so satisfying? 🥺
Congrats. That time is very impressive and consistent.
When will it be able to reach its targeted top speed of 322 km/h? It's "only" doing 270 here.
Time to go back when you've derestricted the top speed, Tesla. Car is obviously held back by its 268 km/h top speed in the straight its. Bet you can shave a second or two off that time!
This is 7 seconds quicker than the Taycan right?!?!?
Supid question which I'm pretty sure I know the answer to: so germany, yes ok but is that an american model or a german model : is that reading in kilometers per hour or miles per hour. I imagine kilometers?
Who is the driver?
Wow
Shit that is fast.
That’s the beauty of an all electric powertrain. You could be driving at >200 kph and still carry on a conversation with the passenger.
Her girlfriend told her she is alone in the house.
This acceleration is just nuts! Like I can't fathom putting that peda to the metal
Which speedometer is the accurate one tho? Just curiosity no hate btw
I just love how this driver drives the Yoke with ease
I love this car. But it just makes me appreciate just how fast the Porsche 919 Evo is. To be able to to finish and then wait over 2 mins for this Plaid to cross the line. That lap record defies physics. Go and watch it seriously.
That was awesome ... and scray .... and awesome!
I wanna want this car
I want to see the Tesla FSD Auto-pilot BREAK the Nurburgring record 😉
Incredible foot-work with that clutch! 😂
No overheat? realy? Its very cool. Is overheat will not appear in longer race? x5 longer race? full throttle until battery fully discharge?
Damn 7 seconds faster than a civic
I love tesla and yes this plaid is the fastest car but in driving experience isn't comparable with amg line from Mercedes or BMW
ICE fans say that 7:35 is slowwww
That steering wheel looks so bad to use.
Been waiting for this
193 👎🏼 = The 13 Major Auto MFG’s + 180 Gordon Johnson accounts.
Please do Spa
🤯
👍👍👍👍
This is a stock plaid with stock tires lol.
Limited by tyres in corners, great video.
Super affordable, light and mass-produceable all electric car that even Latin America and Europe can buy when?
Thats the most stupid steering wheel for a road car that I've ever seen
Can't wait for Tesla to debut in India🇮🇳
Who is the driver?
Incredible. How does it compare to what’s available for purchase?
Needs a bigger display on the dash
I know it is a production electric car lap record, and really fast lap, but the actual time does not seem that great considering the power.  Porsche Panamera Turbo which is 400hp weaker has a better time on the Ring by almost 6 seconds... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9nPCTrfk5Y
hearing the tires instead of engine must be nice
Is that wheel , +÷× yoke ! the best for aggressive driving?
Awesome
Take my money 💰
Just freeezing 🤯
That time still isn't impressive for a car with 1000hp and that fast acceleration time
0:53 holy shit
why is he struggling/figting with the steering? is it that unprecise? does it have like 270 degrees of full left-right rotation?
Now do another lap while playing some classical 🎶
The Nurburgring is incredible. Probably one of the greatest tracks in all Formula One. It’s awesome they’ve driven an actual Tesla on it. Definitely seems like the driver isn’t quite used to this level of acceleration in a car like this though. For someone who is probably trained to go on tracks like the Nurburgring, he sure did clip a lot of the turnings. LOL  Seriously though. Wow. We know testers are capable of impressive acceleration and speeds despite the more quiet sounds, but it’s amazing to think it’s actually at this level.😲🤩👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Why are you not using plaid’s full top speed for a freaking nordschleife lap?!
Nice, nice. How many rounds can the Model S do at that pace?
I bet that driver wanted a regular steering wheel!
WoW! Amazing!! That’ll be Porsche and the rest of the VAG Group back to the drawing board again.   Can you confirm if these record breaking machines were unlocked versions of the Model S Plaid or were they also software limited in speed as per current Production Release versions?  Just wondering if there is more to eek out of them if they were currently limited and just how much more they have to give with an unlocked version.   👍🏻
I'd be surprised if it didn't break down behind the scenes
5:53 Tie Fighter nearby
I don't really know what I'm talking about, but it looks like it doesn't handle that well in the corners and is mainly being carried by the sheer power of it.
That steering is awful
Amazing, even sound better than current V8, just turn on subs yo
Still sweaty from the tension of viewing this, cannot imagine how it must feel on board. Amazing driving, but still I would assume that in self-driving (not the kind of generic FSD but rather the car driving itself through a manually generated perfect execution plan of the Ring) it could beat 7:25 just by driving even higher at limits and straighter on the optimal line (dummy driver weight included).
Cool
That thing is scary fast!
You don’t realize it until you peek at the speed !
lol it's electronic.  that's like praying to god the CIA wont kill you
1:38 air
C'mon then.. what are the modifications? Big brakes? Custom suspension?
Is this mph or kph on the dashboard?
The taycan Turbo s is still faster than the plaid around the nurburgring
Nice, I was like a week too early looking for this recently, now here's the video I wanted
This looks very exciting. From what I know of driving the ring (from Forza and Gran Tourismo) is it was a hairy lap.
Happy World EV Day
Huge amount of coasting and still the temp went from 21C to 67C by the end of the lap. It doesn't look like it can be driven flat out for a whole lap.
The motors sounds like the proton pack powering up. Those who knows know.
He started with 94% battery and ended with 57%. It seems that with this perforamance the battery drain is huge! Nevertheless this car slaps the ICE industry in the face and we haven't even see what the roadster will do. The future of Tesla seems so cool.
Hey! My tesla makes that noise too 😀
They forgot to put the audio....oh wait....🤣🤣🤣🤣
Swedish driver 🇸🇪🏁 Andreas Simonsen
Who is the driver? What tire did thet use? It looks like one of the stangest nurburgring lap ever seen, with lots of coasting and restricted top speed that cost a lot of time. Why is that? brealking problems, overheating, etc... cause of the heavy weight?
Not bad for accidentally leaving it on chill mode.
Dude never went below 100hmh in the entire video... Good lord I would've probably screamed if i was on board lol
Looks like it’s still speed limited. 260k could def blow thru 300 on the straight
suggestion : There should be a 'Sabine Schmitz' mode  :)
Next step: without a pilot!
I hope Tesla make an estate of this!
Watch in 2x
looks great but i think the Alfa Giulia did it 3 seconds faster for nearly half the price. but this is still mighty impressive for an electric car tbf
6:47 More time could be gained from here... Could it reach +300kms/h?
The electric motor be like “juuuuiiiii” The wheels be like “crchrchrrhchr”
This is hothach time or four door Alfa🤷‍♂️  they dont impress me much 🤷‍♂️ 1000hp super truper accleration car 4motors blablabla ... Teslas are good for dragstrip not for race laping... look how driver was fighting.. 7/10 for me🤷‍♂️😜
can‘t wait for the Unplugged Plaid
Wie viele Runden machen die Reifen denn mit, man hört ja dauernd die Reifen quietschen?
Unreal 10092021
nope, i still dont like that yoke, give me a full wheel
Some sounds in this video make it seam like the car has some loose parts... Amazing video overall, very entertaining
I thougt it would be capable of 7:20ish...
Would have been under five minutes with autopilot.
I love how the german radio station WDR2 is displayed the whole time 😄
Will Autopilot be able to drive as well as this driver?
I wanna try I wanna try !!!
The car is undoubtedly super fast, but from a camera perspective you get no audible perspective of speed. Being the driver or passenger for that matter would release all those senses. The only thing I sadly see and hear is rattles and understeer with tortured tyres. If a passenger seat becomes available for a sceptic of electric in 2021 I'm available at a moments notice. And yes it still gets a thumbs up.
Porsche has been really quiet since this dropped =)
Would be interested to know how much power was harvested from regen braking for this lap
It's interesting how some professional drivers are always correcting the steering wheel in the corners where others don't. I wonder if it is a bias between correcting throttle or steering.
I don't hear anything...
When's the FSD lap?
As fast a BMW M4 😂😂
There'a lot that should go in handling and stuff like that because the Porsche panamera turbo S, a car similar in size, 400kgs heavier, no electric motor (it's not the hybrid version) and around 800hp did it in 7:29.810. Even though it has a higher center of gravity Porsche managed to make it handle corner way better than this Tesla Plaid. Porsche Taycan Turbo S which is also heavier and has less power did it in "only" 7 more seconds.
Mercedes Amg Gt 63 s - 7:27  Bmw m5 cs - 7:29 Tesla s plaid - 7:35 Taycan turbo - 7:42  Now think, why didn't porsche public their taycan turbo s time on nurb? Answer is most likely they waited to see what will tesla be capable of, I'm pretty much sure that's the only argument. I wish Porsche will prove once again they're the best, but 7 seconds. Interesting
Is he charging his phone while racing? 😂
Understeer Queen 👑👑
Terrible..... Slower than a GTR with half the power  And a minute slower than a Gt2 Rs   What's impressive.....
Listen to the tires HODL!!! 😉 $tsla
I'm so like it's acceleration sound. It's like Spaceship engine ramping up 😂
Just curious - why would you thumbs down? I know there are people who do it because they are sad about life....  But for the auto enthusiast, WHY? This is breathtaking and equally amazing!
easy
Can't beat the Porsche Panamera 😷😷
Amost 1 minute slower than the best one ? How is that possible ? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_N%C3%BCrburgring_Nordschleife_lap_times
are these regular TO marked Michelin PS4 S?  im interested in knowing if the Cup 2 R would be able to withstand the amount of instant torque and if so, better lap time? Tesla has a history of being very realistic in testing and i doubt these are anything else than the OEM michelin ps4s for better real world results.  Would that mean that there is a potentially faster lap time or maybe they tried and the Cup2 R cant last an entire lap?
And then u realise the panamera turbo is faster 😂😂💀💀💀😅
2X playback speed is fun too.  😀
Who is the driver?
Goosbumps as i hear the shreeks and squeels of the tiires
I love the audio of this video.. <3
The acceleration is just blowing my mind, It's one thing to see it in numbers but another to see it in action.
I am confused over the Speed, was the display showing kph? If so it hit 273 ( 169.6mph) If so does this mean the plaid's motors still cannot do the quoted 200mph!!!
269kph max? Curious why this car isn't unlocked for a higher top speed? Could have shaved  a few seconds on the straightaway.
That looked scarier than a crew dragon launch!
Epic!
Garbage，considering it has 463hp more than the gt63s
Hey look. A car for rich ppl .
I hope they have this in the new gran tourism
Its still slower than nearly half the power sedans lol
Definitely not pretty but gets the job done. Model 3 is a much better platform for the ring.
Haha that driver prob would appreciate a real wheel tho.
@felixba 👀
Meanwhile my car takes forever to accelerate from 80 to 120kmph like this thing casually does it like it's nothing
Credit the driver?
Tesla join f1 motors.
稳定性真好
Go, go, go!!!
Offer better brakes, tires and unlock 200mph and then come back to set another record! Amazing this was done with the yoke as well!
So that's what The Stig is up to these days...
Jesus, acceleration like in rocket ;oo
Now you can hear the creaking of the car and the stretching of the wheels. This could let the R&D department to examine the actual situation of the car during races and could farther improve them. I think this will not be possible if the car was still ICE.
yall hurting more the planet with ur electric cars then with gas cars ,yall know that
Audi RS3 its faster lol
213mph for Tesla model s plaid release it now
Looks like the front loads up a little too much here and there.. and you can sense how heavy the car is.. still.. it's unbeatable unless you bring million(s) to the table.. and then to be able to hear your tires... The perfect drivers car....
Incredible. This has made me want to revisit the 'ring and drive it again. And to anyone who's not driven it, it's a must - It's a lot of fun (even if a little scary).
Tokyo drift
Big Tamiya Car ! Tesla's inspiration for Plaid :)
Looks like barely controlled panic, that steering wheel is the stuff of nightmares.
I'm no expert, but I feel that he could have done better if he had the full steering wheel. Mainly around the corners :D
Hopefully you had shadow mode on, and now it can drive itself 15-20 seconds faster. Plenty of places he could have had the power on quicker and for longer in some places too. Maybe even sub seven min.
A much quicker way to preheat the battery for Supercharging. 😂
when the crash?
its about handling here not how fast you can go ......this is where the plad might fall apart
I hope that was Randy Pobst driving if not it should be he knows how to drive tesla Plaid  and surely that's not the top speed  268kph /166mph , come on Tesla go balls deep in the Plaid  at the Ring  😉 😜 😆
Mercedes-AMG GT 63 S & Panamera Turbo S are still 10 sec faster, amazing driving anyway!
This video is a joke. You can literally hear the shitty quality with all the creaking going on. And let's just be honest, it's not a sports car. A sportscar needs downforce and the Model S is designed to glide through the air. So why sell the car as something it so clearly isn't.
accelerating its mindblowing
Waaaaaaath 😳😲🤭
That was terrifying
impressive for straight from the factory with all the normal limitations in place cant wait to see it go again with the limits removed and some track tires and abit of aero work done to see how much faster it can go
Was ein Abstieg
dam the tires lol
From start line to finish line 7,36 min
Missing things:  - A lap timer - A G force meter
Already broken glass. What is that thing at drivers A pillar?
Driver: accelerates Tesla: warp speed it is
Nice audio. 👂
yolk wheel might slow down some driver's
That was very impressive! Even more impressive is how much time was still left on the track, I assume to prevent the stock brakes from melting.
Great car, but don't like the steering wheel or lack of it.
The Stig has gone Plaid.
Still over 10s slower than a GT63s
Mqgnificent .. bravo
Why didn't the driver ever go over 300kph? Even on the straight-away the car never got over 265, even though it has a top speed of 322...
Lots of tire squeel. Losing precious seconds.
Must be sweating in that suit… 😂
AMAZING! Well done guys. "Ahead of time" in each and every way - LEADING THE WAY.
They should be able to shave off a few more seconds when the 200 mph top speed is unlocked. Awesome!!
I bet it would have been much easier for him with a normal steering wheel.
It doesn’t seem to handle very well. Plenty of brown pants moments for the driver.
give me a plaid and i will do it in 7.30 :)
Over 1000hp and AWD to beat a Honda Civic by 8 seconds. Great driving but batteries are clearly not the future.
Boring electric car, old petrol M5 CS is faster than this overpowered car....
Now do FSD
268 kph on the straight, still limited top speed? 7:05 min
Listen to the sound of that V10, oh my god
Those Tyre's though yikes
In future days I think teakwood be the best electric car company
7:35 is incredible
That’s crazy
Wonder how much Wh/km he used lol
Is that kmh or mph
👍👍👍
Thats not a car, Its a spaceship on wheels!
Who is the driver?
This is THRILLING
The sound engineers working on the next Forza now have the best vehicle for getting the tire noise just right.
What's best is that the sound of the motors seem completely real. Built electric gokarts and that's the sound I love
can you imagine FSD being this good in the future?
I love this car and musk
I thought it was interesting that the map didn't move at all.
3:25 look at this 100-200. Soo incredible and the motors sounds like a Turbo 🔥🔥
It's still true. American cars can't corner...
with a normal steering wheel it would be faster
Before to hear the tires I thought sound was turned on mute...
What tyres where used during the run?
Agenda goon accounts sent here to moan about the steering wheel are hilarious.
What they didn’t tell you is that this was Tesla Bot driving with the FSD Beta 10 installed.
the speed was in kph right ?
Porsche did 7:42.34, 2 years ago in 2019 LMAO tesla is fucking trash
Old news, Tesla has been building rocket ships for years. Space X.
Thrilling!
🚀🚀🚀
quick just on straight..it fights with every turn
Would it be really interesting to see if Tesla's AI could do better? a fantasy that I share with you! LOL
Where the rubber meets the road
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_XE Also this car did 7:23, i was expecting more for the plaid.
I’m not blown away. A ten year old GTR is faster by 10 seconds.
Pretty sure Merz EQS and Hamilton are coming for it. Enjoy the title while you can.
Has the time been verified by the Nürburgring?
Ahhh the beautiful sound of understeer...
Could be front windshield didn't stand the G-force?
I like it, i want it!😎
A little telemetry on screen would be nice. Still, not a bad effort. No power limit for all of the lap?
I so want one!!!!
Elon tweeted “Tesla Model S Plaid just set official world speed record for a production electric car at Nurburgring. Completely unmodified, directly from factory.” No, no, no,  Mr. Elon. Just buy watching this video you can see that there were a few modifications. However, impressive anyway. Also, it would be good to see how the battery temperature behaved…
when will Tesla join F1?
So, slower than a M3? For Double the money?
POC for the Yoke?  Unpopular opinion, but there were turns where it literally cost hundreds of milliseconds
So tsla to the moon??
Anybody has infos on the tires?  Are they factory ps4s or cup 2?
Nervous handling due to the weight...not a track car!
1000HP and it cant get to 300KPH on the end straight?
id like to see if the car wasnt limited to 268 kmh
Totally unmodified except for a steering wheel, 35000 worth of ceramic brakes and lightweight wheels and tires, and that’s just what we can see. This car has a yoke; it isn’t the record run car.
Delete the human and see what FSD can do.
30s seconds off from what you claimed is possible in 2019, quality.
The window is broken?
Iam from INDIA so iam completed DEPLOMA MECHANICAL ENGINEERING U have a job vacancy ?
Tesla Forever ❤️
Mind Niki.
The handling feels like crap, and slow  in corners, ok in straight line seems to accelerate pretty good, but the steering 'wheel' is a hazard at best, the weight inertia is outright dangerous, the grip  feels consistent with a suv :). Please take a look at the elegance of Mercedes-AMG GT 63 S 4MATIC, the grip, the stability and all... not to mention no tires were chewed up during this :)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR5WC9Y3SYo
yes
Amazing steering response 😍😍
fast but cruel inside
Now immagine how fast the lap would have been with a proper steering wheel! It’s painful having to watch him constantly changing his grip.
Poor little tyres! You can really hear the weight of that car.
Уберите человека, пусть автопилот это делает!
Can autopilot do better😝
Wow
268 was it mph or kph?
Redesign the tail lights
Wow its slower than a Cayenne, Panamera , Giulia and  Rs3 . Impressive
I could have gone faster
すごい新鮮な感じする〜
The ride is very smooth just like in my Peugeot Bipper 1.4 HDI:)
Well plaid
Not my cup, sorry
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
So... 24H Le Mans when?
Would love to see drone footage
That steering wheel though 😵‍💫🥴nice lap anyways
Thank you for letting me see the Nürburgring
Wooh sounds like every time he plants the foot down a ghostbusters proton pack starts up😀
Excellent 👏👏🤩🥳
How does it do without a driver at all?
The driver is goated
268 kph!!!
Plot twist: driver is the new Tesla Robot.
Tesla ASMR
I like the fire suit when there is no fuel
7.30 @ 168kph INSANE RECORD TAKEN!!!!!!!!!!!! Anyone wanna try tomorrow?   Correction: Maybe Sebastian went 7.16 for the record? Correction 2: Must fact check(note to self) Driver was in fact Andreas Simonsen and he should be acknowledged as one of the GREATS!!!! PERIOD
6.06 check it. Speedometer of car which in backside of installed speedometer having different variation between 10 km per hour.
J'aime pas les électrique mai faut avoué que sa marche fort
That's a fucking production car smashing a world record! Let that sink in.
Sanctioned NHRA 1/4 mile  dragstrips will not permit Plaids to run all out w/o chute and cage, that is straght line and in proximity to crash barrier. Think how fast an airbag system must sense and deploy at those speeds.  Was  that runs top speed being restraned by the software speed limiter?
the worst steering wheel ever....
Got 'Ya! That's Sebastian Vettell.... HE'S BLOODY GOOD
Absolutely mind blowing! Can't wait for the roadster to shatter this time :D
I wonder if there is a car that can go even slower having over a 1000 horsepower.
would be good to see the speedometer and g force
Yo the poor car was just not built for this
Tires burning after drive, driver: "Do you smell that? It smells like future".
Is he charging his phone while he does this?
the most boring lap ever in Nürburgring
What tires were used?
Waiting for my Model X Plaid.  Ill probably trade it in 2 years for the Cybertruck and Roadster.....
Holy sh…
This was amazing... I guess the next big achievement would be Autopilot doing a lap around the Nordschleife
Everyone is complimenting the car, and the sheer driving prowess of the driver  Me: *Those poor tyres. Dying of death*
So What do we think the elapse time is? I got 7:42? Which is just a second faster than the Honda Civic R Type.
Well, why do you need all that speed if the highway limit is 70 mph lmao. This is just Elon compensating for something. :DD The VW ID.R took more than a minute less and has less horse power and even a worse 0-60 time.
Id like to see it driven by the AI 😂😂
When self-drive will beat that result?
Well hello there
Silent beast…! Add acceleration and brake graphic would be great 👍
how much battery did it have left after one such lap?
çok çok iyi 👏
Now slap some larger slicks and better brakes on
Soulless
New Record model S later, 7 minutes and 30 seconds and probably Tesla has to upload New videos because model S plaid is a megacar will destroy mega German cars
Things to note: - The brakes seemed to be limiting, had to use more regenerative braking to compensate. In turn this lead to limited power towards the end of the lap.   - The suspension can still be improved by quite a bit. Either software updates or third party kits like K&W etc. This should improve lap time by a decent bit.  - car was software limited to 267 km/h. If that can get lifted it also lowers laptime by a little bit. How much depends on if you can get the car to the end of the lap without it throttling that heavily.
1000 hp and it does not more than 267 kph? Is that self limited?
Wow, total respect!  Awesome car. Awesome driver. I love the sound too. 😯
FINALLY HE UPLOADED THE VIDEO
Remember this is a 4 door sedan... just keep that in mind
7:35 with that much HP? That's terrible, back to the drawing board.
FSD 10 with nobody in the car....  Train it to go fast...
Sweet Jesus that thing can move!
So, the numbers and bars on the extra display… Top number… battery temp? Lower number… kph. Interesting that it differs quite a lot from the normal speedo. Top bar… Temp of something? Maybe brakes or tyre temps? Lower bar… Power supplied?
Whos the driver?
The sheer weight of this guy's balls are what's keeping those tires gripping there road
7:12  The car's speedometer displays 277 while the added screen displays 267🤔
Can it be autopilot mode with specified speed?..  that would be easy win.!!
insane!
Great driver for a human. Now do it in Autopilot set to the absolute limit of traction with no fear of human casualty. Probably take 2 seconds off this.
The cars speedometer is exaggerated by an average of 8kmh above real speed
They should make a feature where you can artificially make a v12 sound 😂

Who was the driver?
Next: The same on auto-pilot!
If I had plenty of money to spend I'd buy 2 Model Plaids. I would keep one stock and I would mod the other one. I would take all the unnecessary weight of the second one, replace all the body panels for carbon fiber ones, put a carbon fiber seat, replace the windows for policarbonate windows, put slick tires, tint the back windows so nobody knew that the car has been stripped out... If the stock Tesla Model S Plaid is fast I can't imagine how fast a lightweight version would be.
Sounds like a jet fighter!!!
The straight segment at the Nurburgring was my favorite in Forza Motorsport 😄
10kmh difference in the speed the car think its doing and the GPS race monitor thinks its doing.. thats a lot
this is so fuckin nuts
Amazing.
unreal!
Badass!🔥
This has been the longest 7minutes of my life 😳
Those tires are screaming 😱
Now, time for semi slicks or pure slicks!
NICE  CAR
Wow. That driver have some guts
I can see the the weight affecting the way the car goes around corners but the insane acceleration makes up for that. 👏👏👏
4:34 Goes from 80 to 130 in less than a second. Wow.
wow
Im sort of underwhelmed. On the drag strip and city streets its a missile. On the ring or a long track its struggles bc weight.
Nice video. But seems it wasn’t a record?  What mods, anyone know? Other than what seems a small monitor added above the steering yoke.  No build up, no telemetry. Don’t get me wrong I love the whole thing. Tires screeching, the sound of the motors.  Just another loop round the track video.
Holy shit, with proper tires that thing would easily do sub 7 😮😮😮
how much dogecoin to buy it?! 😝
I don't like the steering wheel
ai someday can drive this way insha'a ALLAH!  the tires are indeed crying with fun 270kph???
The driver is very choppy on the wheel. Why not hire a professional next time?
Nobody hating on the steering wheel? Weird. It fucking sucks!
It’s very obvious, that it is a very heavy car with a low center of gravity. Handling seems nice, but seems to have understeer tendency. Nothing Tesla couldn’t change in an aim to get better lap times, but it also makes clear that this is an acceleration beast more than it is an sportscar. Nonetheless: congratulations on the record :D
The yolk is a joke
These are km/h  or miles/h?
Is this a standard set of brakes or have they been swapped for something more powerful?
Imagine what will happen once Tesla's AI can drive this!
Not sure I like the audio. Maybe they should have a fake IC engine rev tune to give some realistic feeling
How ridiculous is it that a daily driver is this insanely fast
It seems too heavy for the power it possesses
Dangerous job😂
sounds inside like it's about to fall apart.  real made in america. 😂😂
Looks like a wobbly bathtub 🤣
I love you Tesla
Model 3 would done better if it has the same motors
Tires a day suspension will get this close to 7 mins at the ring...that is crazy.
Bono my  tires are gone
I recommend driving a bit faster to get a better time 😉
Lol.. less than 8. Go electric!
Wow!😍✅👍
Great success!!!
OMG... I just crossed out "being a racing car driver" from my to do list!
This is a spaceship not a car :)
try that with one pedal driving!
Shame it didn't beat the fastest record for sedans
I feel like this should be illigal.
#Nordschleife
It feels like a rocket inside and the sound is amazing.
Oh lookan additional HUD behind the wheel. It's almost as if having vital driving information in line of sight is a good idea
7 seconds ahead of the Porsche Taycan
Looks like it's top speed of about 267 km/h is limiting its performance. I guess an increased top speed would significantly improve the time. Congratulation to Tesla! You keep showcasing the power of innovation.
you did what you said ♡
7'30 with 1000hp......   Benz: 7'22 with 630hp.....americans will never learn engineering.
Epic!!!!
Wasn't this supposed to be faster? I mean the 7.42 of the Taycan was the "regular" Turbo version, not the Turbo S, and has a not less horsepower. It's a 6s difference for less 350hp. A round steering wheel would give more confidence to the driver. Insisting on the yoke with no top, no center horn, no turn signals is ridiculous.
This is where a full steering wheel would've helped.
The Stig would have done better.
Look at him sawing at the wheel, shows how unstable this must be.
The acceleration sounds like a jet engine
Massive respect to Tesla, the pilot, and the tires carrying the huge weight of the Tesla and the pilot's balls around the corners!
swishh 🚗💨
ROUGH @/tsla
Who was driving? The Stig?
I think the reason that the Tesla is slower than Mercedes 7:23, Porsche 7:25 and BMW 7:29 sedans is that it looks twitchy in the fast corner braking areas and the slow corners. The driver does not push in the fast corners. The superb acceleration compensates the clumsy cornering. Good concept ruined by weight.
Would love to work with these motors - excellent job guys!
İstanbul dan merhaba 👋, good elektrık cars and tesla cars
Max speed 268 miler per hour or it could be 268km
I must say to me it feels like the driver has to fight the car around each of the corners. Never can he comit to one steering angle, like  you preferably want. This is different with other EV's and specially other cars. The acalleration is still otherwordly and the price to performance ratio still quite impressive! I find the Audio a bit boring, sound design probably isn't an engenering task tesla recognices. On the other hand their software department is does an amazing job, which other car manufacurers should take inspiration from! Interessting video, which emphasises to me the points I believe tesla still has to be working on, jet shows their effort and acivements!
Wait, the speedometer had a 10 km/h difference in high speed?
Is that km or miles?
Electro Power 🔋💪💪💪
Holy Sabine Schmitz in Heaves!
Wow, just wow 😳
not as cool as Toyota's Solid State Battery EV video
the dash displaying km/hr not mph,right??
should it have a fake cvt exhaust sound?
From what I could see, he never went below 100
Do a video of using it on London streets. Love to see that steering wheel on proper driving conditions.
you can hear the tires screaming in pain from its enormous girth
And still some ICE purist says this is not cool!
Oha die Zeit sogar mit Software Speedlimit 👁️👄👁️
Time to make a track car and smash vw
Thanks for the excellent footage, this looks breathtaking from inside the car! Oh and if you watch at half speed it looks almost exactly like my morning commute. 😀👍🏻
Why aren’t the shifter lights working?
So, how would it do on Autopilot?
that's good?
I have no words.
Very fast straight line but due to the weight it’s let down in corners. Civic type r did it in 7:48 considering the power differential just shows how much cornering prowess matters
standard breaks and tires ?
2me its an airplane on wheels! Astonishing👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Lets see the proper lap
👍
Was that his strategy or is there some trick to wobbling or wiggling the steering wheel in corners like he did. Is he trying to get it to bite into the ground better? Idk i just see a lot of that and im curious as to why that is being done.
The driver seems very nervous.
Why did you overlay the video with sound effects from Star Wars?
Dissapointing, ice cars are still ahead, porsche gt 2 did 6:40 and is road legal aswell, almost a minute faster and has way less horsepower
I would be so fuckin scared of hitting a deer going 170 mph
Sehr gut. Bin gespannt ob da noch mehr geht. Wäre toll wenn Tesla an die 6:40 vom Porsche 911 GT2 RS MR aus 2018 noch rann kommt.
This was terrifying!
It has more plastic noises than my 12 years car
Well, that took two years now. And it's not convincing. If you compare this drive with the drive of the Porsche Taycan at the Nürburgring, you'll see that the Tesla is driven on the last groove, while the Porsche drives smoothly down the track with almost no corrections. So if Porsche wants to, they can always get the record.
feels like sitting on a roller coaster
Almost as fast as a giulia qv...
In some curves, speed when approaching the curve was not so "high". I see driver took of the foot from the pedal, waited, waited, waited, then braked, he/she didn't took too high risk of late braking and passing out from the road.
I want to see that 7:30:909 lap!
ELON IS GOAT
Who designed this steering wheel? Designer should be kicked out of the industry.  It looks stupid.  like it's stolen from a vintage stiga toboggan for kids.   Going fast with a overweight car is more dangerous than a lightweight car. Especially on winter roads. Heavy cars has much more weight that wants to pull you off the road in the corners.  On winter roads you could leave a Tesla in the dust while using cruise control because you'll have much higher corner speed on a lighter car with narrower tires.  Tesla would need enough speed on the straights for the owner to loose driving license just to keep up with a Subaru cruising at 100km/h on ice roads.
That was quite lol
The car could have done much better. Speed & acc. were not the problem, but brakes & tires were. A race-tuned version ( including aero add-ons) would slam under 6:30 easily ! Remember this a heavy 4 doors salon car straight out of the production line !
now we need a Model S Plaid GT3 Version :)
Was it miles per hour or kilometres per hour
Is that airplane-like cloche comfortable?
I want that car❤️❤️❤️
Awful handling. No wonder its slower than a base model 911 and a Panamera Turbo. And that steering wheel is still a joke.
I apply for the job of driving that car.
Impressive  Now do a lap of Bathurst
This thing handles like a boat.
Alien technology 👽!
Достойный автомобиль
tesla instrument cluster top speed was 278km/h added device shows 268km/h at 7:05
2 years after Taycan and only 12 second faster with a massive power advantage. Seems like tesla is in trouble. At least for this application.
"KIT come get me"
crazy fast as fast as a golf gti cs s
that steering wheel is horrible
Грязно проходит. Я, конечно, и так не смогу, но для профессионального пилота, он делает много ошибок.🤔
That car is actually a jet. Mad props to the driver!  (...and props to the tyres, that were crying literally the whole lap) 😉
I spotted crack at windshield.
Any reason why the incar stock speedometer and the add-on speedometer have different readings?
Nice, but that steering wheel is shite. It needs some sort of horns for a better maneuverability.
Who was behind the wheel?
If you carry the right line into turns shown on markings, no need to fight the car.  Watch his hands as he enters on the wrong line then has to search out proper line to get turn right.
Homie was going 279 mph at one point
Such a viseral experience. Obviously one knows the car is flying, the speedometer, and squeeling tyres confirms it, but the lack of any noise other than the futuristic humm, makes it look slow. >_< Great time from a great car! Expecting major improvements on the "modified" laptime!
Why do I feel the driver was sandbagging a little on some of the straights?
top speed 269 kph....i wonder what the roadster will be able to do.
If Tesla launch FSD pilot mode? It will be insane!
C'est moyen, plutot mediocre...Enfin c'etait nul !!! Pour une voiture de plus de 1000 cv !!!
Tesla should release Plaid Track edition
I wonder what his honest opinion of the yoke is?🤔
I'm not really sure but i feel like i miss a proper steering wheel. But it was a sick lap, respect for the driver! Thumbs up
This song is siiiic
I wanna see Musk drive that!
plot twist : it was all autopilot
Any modifications done to the Plaid for this run?
I love the model s. But this steering looks so difficult to control
Why is the top speed so (s)low? 267km/h (Datasheet: 322 km/h)
1:16 that looks SCARY  Driving a Tesla in a circuit as those speeds 😬😬
What tires were they running?
why is there a difference between the two screens showing speed?
...but but shouldn't this be impossible with a yoke?!!!!
Video description should also say a new world speed record was set for a production electric car 166.329 km/hr
To add louder sounds just put a couple of kids on the back seats 😂
Please send this for review on The Grand Tour. It's amazing.
No sound, no vibrations, no feeling the gear changes... I almost felt asleep while watching this video
That time is not impressive AT ALL for 1000hp. Handles terrible.
WOW! ❤️
It...Sounds...Like... K.I.T.T.
Not a big differece to the Taycan.. 7s faster with 300 more hp
*_Looks like LIGHTNING_* *_Moves like LIGHTNING_* *_Steers like a COW_* !!!
Impressive. ~3 sec faster then a 2,5 tonne 640 hp SUV from Porsche.
I’m still not a fan
The speed seems to be limited it can go much faster
The steering seems so imprecise
This is the stock version?
It's like driving an airplane that's about to launch  !! . Wonderful noise 😍😍!!!
Awesome Thanks!
Tesla me dá um carro de vcs de presente 😁
Yooooo all i can say it is its fastening speed and that sound  Omg😱that sound Mann OMG i will buy when will my father Get,s cash i will defenetaly buy mannnn i love it
I can clearly see that steering with upper portion would have given the driver a better grip while taking turns. Need little more material on upper part of steering to hold.
In your face, Edmunds
The driver it's suggesting the car to turn
This video just shows how insane the cornering speed of F1
I would have thought they were aiming for under 7 mins. 7:35 isn't that quick tbh.
Really impressive. How fast can it do it driving itself?
Gorgeous exhaust
Is it real or a video game?
Tesla needs to raise the speed limiter!!!
Unemployed in Greenland
Feels like playing Real Racing on iPhone. It's perfect 👌🏽
this is so satysfying to watch
121 dislikes are tycan owners.
why is he not going faster than 270 on the straight when the claimed top speed is 322 ???
I don‘t know why, but I think the taycan looks safer.
I really love Tesla
casually teaching the tesla how to race
Amazing! the Tesla did it with a TV screen in the car and half steering wheel...
Would love to see a no-limits driverless FSD run.
wow.. keep acceleration on 250km/h.... 👍👍
So fast😱😱😱😱
is the weight is the biggest factor why it's not faster than some ice cars? despite having instant torque.
could le mans please get the all electric class next year.  any all electric production car with 250 cars sold. its what le mans is all about,,,NOW please
No impressive at all, not fun at all just power.
It's so bizarre seeing a car this fast yet hearing no engine sound :).
Holy shit this is slow?? I'd have thought you'd at least be able to beat the heavier, slower panamera but no.
The M5 Cs would probably be around the same time and sound and pollute oh so better
Waiting for FSD lap 🤔
This video demonstrates that this car has got great power but the chassis/suspension is not up to the task! He is fighting this car through the twisty sections with the massive amount of tyre scrubbing occurring indicating a poor set up.
That looked good but felt unsettling all that weight .....tyres ek...
It only beet the Porsche Cayenne turbo gt by a few seconds 😬  but then again tesla isn't really known for track cars
Jeeez that is slow :-D 1100 hp and you can't even reach 270 down to schwedenkreuz.. Lol.. Flugplats 165.. you are only 10 sec faster than a megane .. What a joke these Tesla's are..
Poor tiers
Great video!! But what happened on the straight....only 270 km/t..?
Record-breaking 7:35 minutes of holding my breath
Just yokin' around
Were the speed in km/ml ?
Very good driving skills.
The future is here!
Once the 162 MPH limit is unlocked it will be even faster.
Would love to see Tesla train their FSD to do this on autopilot!!
Now let's do it with FSD 😬😬😬
Hi there ICE owners, here's the news: It's over. An electric four door saloon just stomped the Lamborghini Murcielago LP640 and the McLaren Mercedes SLR by more than ten seconds round the Ring. Not a drag strip, not just beaten on acceleration, but an outright stomping on a race track.
This is a sedan right then imagine what Tesla going to achieve when they launching a hyper sports car 😑
Boring ... handling is awfull
270 top speed?
269 I think was the fastest I saw?
your move waymo
Not so fast round a track as in a straight line
Can’t wait to see how FSD will handle the track.
Hate the steering wheel tho
Impressive but still only 7sec faster then the taycan turbo s and has 250 more hp
Incredible
That yoke is just stoopidd.
Next, Tesla in F1 🥳
is it easy to rotate the box type wheel..?
They finished the video when the car hit the speed of (69) LMAOOOOOOOOOOO
Watch this video in 2️⃣❎ Speed 🤯
Amazing video and performance!  But, why have they kept it limited to 165mph??  Surely, with the car being capable of that yet limited for road legalities only, it's not classed as a mod?
💥🔥
Insane!! Rides like a champ though!! Well done Tesla!
That's intense driving. I noticed a difference in speed between the speedometers.
Love the tesla software and platform but man are tesla cars ugly from the rear, and remove that dumb glass roof and let us choose if we can close it or open with shader.
If there’s no roll cage that’s terrifying
Man this is why i love electric car, the engine sounds cool
Is the speedometer showing mph or km/h?
Maintaining that speed with that yolk wheel and crusing through the corners 🙌
Don’t know why it’s so slow, expected below 7 minutes for this. Can’t have great tyres on.
I think they need a 120 Hz panel for the speedometer
Honestly I was expecting better. M5 CS, similar size and price, did a 7:29 around the N-ring running 400 less horsepower
so is this without the speed limiter?
Nice, video ends with a speed of 69
Love how it just loses everything in the top end
Great time! 🏁 I Love this steering wheel, reminds me of K.I.T.T. from Knight Rider https://youtu.be/Avxkj1UQWxg
Tyres and is that chassis flex I can hear?
not nurburgring approved, so not a valid "record". Saw some of the Tesla test cars at the Ring... They were all modified, semi slick tires, aero etc.
No wonder drivers crash on the track with that amount of speed!
So uncomfortable steer. I didn't like it.
Wow! The future has arrived!
Next level will be on autopilot?
Everyone : yoke is not good for racing Tesla tester driver :
This is slow for 1000hp. Seriously slow.
it's so strange not to hear the roar of the engine
How about an optional aero kit?  Looks like it could use one  😁
Considering this is based on the ‘family sedan’ of Tesla’s models imagine what the Roadster will be like
Lovely bit of 'one pedal' driving.
Driving this while the kids are playing video games in the backseats :D :D
Woosh! What a driver!  Like a uber in Newcastle
This time is nowhere near as impressive as the Laguna Seca lap time. Though wasn't the Laguna Seca lap time done with a Plaid+ prototype ?
Is that Nico Rosberg??👀
Fun fact: This video ends at 7:45
This car climbs up the speed FASTER than my car climbs RPM 😂😂
What tyres is it running?
Boring. 1 hour battery cool down after this single lap?
Anyone notice the speed being different on the extra display from the built in one? Wondering why this is...
Lol imagine thinking a washing machine sounds good. Not one person here has ever even been to ring, and its nothing but tires being overdriven. One lap hero, useless.
That moment when it understeer and he throttle it to pull it away is amazing
was it stock on stock tires or not? great driving
The spots where the car jumps on a turns at 150+ scares me, so professionally done, nice
Car looks so planted. Nice
This man is eligible to become a f1 racer.
Does anyone know if the top speed is still software limited or not?
So 270kmh is a max? Past 250 acceleration is extremely slow
Take my money..
Really thought it is going to be fast but that thing is so slow around the green hell 🤣
Can realy see him putting work to handle all that weight. If tesla can make the roadster alot lighter, that plaid powertrain will be able to really produce an amazing time.
This is civilized compared to the 919 Hybrid EVO run
Bless Elon's heart.
he whippin
Who is driving? Kudos to him too.
On the long straight you can see it’s limited to 267kmh … could have gone faster delimited.
I need this video as VR experience. @Tesla please? Elon, somebody...
impressive but that steering wheel... I know F1 cars have a similar one but they don't weigh in at 2.5tons or want as much steering correction as the plaid
hi..i thought the car would make 300 km/h at bridge "Antoniusbuche"with 1000 hp, but obviously aerodynamics aren´t so good..looks like a production sedan with no safety cage and aerodynamic gimmicks..good performance anyway..
That tesla key isn't going anywhere even with these G forces. Good charging place for your phone
What do we learn from this? This car was not made for corners. Jezz that looked sketchy.
Incredible. High performance commercial sedan, Excellent driver.
Good god! Never mind the straight line speed - the way this thing (driven by this crazily talented and fearless driver!) flies through the corners is just bonkers. The cornering speeds are hilarious - often well above 100mph - take Schwalbenschwanz as an example! Who said this thing would only be good in a straight line? Watch and learn…
7 and a half minutes of going from "wooaaah" to "4 energy saving P.O.S tires" and back. This is the worst handling car ever to get 7:30. Can't wait for the track package for those looking for more than a long-range cruiser that can insanely "Plaidly?" lurch straight forward. It better be more than what the model 3 track package offers if you want to have the all-round fastest EV title.
so it's 4 seater right 🙆🏻‍♂️ what if...
Topped out at 267 km/h, which means this probably was the software limited top end. They might be able to eek out a few more seconds once they release those last 35 mph of top end.
Was that a Porsche 911 turbo that passed the plaid at 5:52?
Fast Buzzy Boiii
The weight of the car seems to be what hurts the speed and punishes the tires in the corners. Slingshotting into the straights may not quite make up for that. Also the quietness of it - I think I heard the driver swear under his breath twice when he didn't get those turns quite as perfect as he was hoping for, normally you'd hear engine noise and never know whether a driver did that. Still it's an interesting run none the less.
That’s so incredible, and it looks like there’s still some seconds left on the table too
4:28 the acceleration from 80 kph to 180 kph fighting for grip is just mind blowing!
Sheesh the power and sound of a V8
This car is truly not made for this lol. What a disappointing time.
Rather be in a gt2 rs
who is driving? sebastian vittel?
Pack temp from 21 Celcius to 67 Celcius delta of 46 Celcius.. not really settling at any point. Also what kind of modifications where made?
155 mph and Elon claims it's the worlds fastest production car? 😂
Looks like speedometers don’t agree on speed, is the front one based on GPS?
Looks like the car lacks grip in some high speed corners
?
Who is the driver?
It's so relaxing and satisfying kinda
I want one! 😍 Dear Santa..... 🤣🤣🤣👍🏻
Keep it to the straight lines man. This was scary to watch, sketchy af, terrible. Elon should ask Mercedes how to build proper cornering luxury sedans. #GT63S #8secondsfasterthanplayed
You can hear the chassis flexing.
You can't really appreciate the persistence of vision tunnel effect at those speeds with it being recorded....that must have been scary awesome...
I love my Tesla Model 3, and I love the model S Plaid straight line speed, it looks insane fast! But the amount of steering corrections the driver needs to make is insane too! The model S plaid looks very sketchy on the limit. Compare this footages to the Taycan 7:42 lap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m31EgQkswg. Also note way less tire split on the Taycan (did the use stock tires or slick road tires?). It's still pretty insane the Model 3 Plaid is only 40 seconds slower than the new 911 GT3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGF7AgzlPMk. Telsa should definitely recruit some suspension engineers from Porsche for there Berlin plant! If Tesla could replicate the Taycan driving dynamics its years ahead on all area's!
The car needs a navball!
Needs a track mode and most importantly a drift mode
What a heavy slowpoke :))) A GT2 RS will obliterate it on this circuit.
Just play this in the background for proper sound: Record Lap – Mercedes-AMG GT 63 S 4MATIC+ on the Nürburgring Nordschleife - YouTube  Mind, the audio is off 8s by the end of the video....  Edit: It actually wors astonishing well for the firsts 2 minutes when you play the videos in parallel and sync up the first corner... 😄
whau looks like a new record by 7 sek :) amazing driver a lot of wheel action, (if you call it a wheel :) )
Imagine being able to judge when and where to accelerate or decelerate, turn in or out, simply because you can actually hear the car giving you feedback.
Okay, now do doughnuts!
Can you send over the internal cabin wind noise sound over to polyphony digital /Turn 10 / playground games,  They would really like it,
Dude you kidding me, I know every inches of this track, its my favorite one in Gran Turismo
Thats not fast at all for 1020hp 🤣 slower than a first gen Nissan Gtr....
Spaceship made for roads 😁
video uploaded at 2x?
That steering wheel is not suitable for that kind of driving!
Actually Tesla is selling racing cars named as FAMILY CARS
very good exhaust notes
How about self-driving? :)
Although good performance I personally would like proper V8 or V10 sound tbh..
Over 1000 bhp, Over 2 tonnes. Let's all give a shootout to the real hero here.. the tires!  Also in the background... *muffled angry noises from Weissach*
That's scary
This shows  me that that steering wheel does not  work
His gear changes are a bit of😀😀😁😁😉😉😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😄😄😄😄
Seems FSD was disengaged a lot. Disencouraging for Karpathy & team
That speedo is kph right?
that race logic display on there with a ma grotto clamp is next level jank 😂
I really don't like the lack of engine sound, it feels like playing a video game in mute. But not matter how I feel, in a few years EV will be mandatory, so better getting used to it, and these Teslas seem to rock.
7:35 with 1020ho? Should that impress anyone? Thats slower than a stock Panamera Turbo.
Needs a speedometer readout (mi/hr and km/hr plz!)  edit: there is one just visible on the dash (very cool!)
Can wait for my Cyber truck
I can hear that amazing electric motor sound all day.. Its like ironman suit sound😍
Love that sound in the straights
Now set an unrestricted lap time!
If you close your eyes it sounds like a way too fast metro.
Spettacolo…💯
SO AWESOME!!!!   How long before the car co-drives and helps the driver push the ultimate limits of the car?  There must be at least seconds that the car can save by selecting specific performance parameters at specific points on the track?
I expected way more from a car that can do 0-60 in around 2 seconds! For context, the fastest SUV around the green hell (Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT), took just three seconds more (time: 7:38.9)! And when it comes to the fastest sedan (Amg GT four door), it did it in around 12 seconds less! Disappointed.
Slow time for 1100HP.  I bet most Tesla nerds were expecting sub 7:00.
Guys remember this is a upper class family sedan, a dude with 4 kids drive around this thing and it’s legal
I wonder how much battery that ate up.
Seeing the drivers hand i assume it was hard to control the car using yolk
Elon musk  giveaway 10 Tesla🚗🔌🔋car 😂 when 10 million subscribe complet in  youTube 😜
That looks like a workout!
tire scrubbing is so nice without a Ice engine
Audi RS3 has the time of 7:35:522 - still I prefer a tesla tbh. cause audi makes shit electric cars
People saying the sound is amazing? You all need to watch Kevin estre lap in a gt3 rs
And yet, a porsche panamera with 350 less horses is faster. Proof that how much ever power they put into their car, they don't know how to engineer them lol. Just put tech, add 1000 hp and please dumb silicon valley techies who dont know shit about cars.
7:30 in a 1000hp car? Lol. Ok. Thats.....slow.
You can see from the video that this car isn’t made for this. The tires are fighting the weight a lot and it looks like there is some mayor under steering going on. It doesn’t even hit close to teslas claimed v-max on the long straights. Looks to uncontrolled to me.
Far out that's crazy! Great car! But absolutely amazing driver!
So you're saying I could run from the cops in this?
Et tout ça avec un yoke 😳
Gosh this is slow for 1000+hp. Still just a straight line car
SICK DRIVE!  Think I'd be sick if I was a passenger  :)
I want to see FSD do this. Now that would be mind-blowing hehe, hats off watching your speed as a function of the road was exhilarating.
What's the time
This is Terrifyingly Satisfying
That was awesome mate.
Lap time...?
That looked twitchy to say the least, kudos to the driver. But geez that thing is fast, what a monster.
Graz on beating Porsche
How far have humans gotten to, GG Tesla!
Now do it with the FSD Beta!
The yoke seems to work just fine. So tired of the internet clowns who act like their skills exceed the yoke's capability.   No. Obviously it's the other way around
still very very slow for a 1000hp car lmao
Who is the pilot?
Okay but what’s the time with autopilot on?
Which tire were you using? Cup 2 R?
IS THAT HIS PHONE CHARGING?
The Video we've all been waiting for!
It's so nice and quiet. The tires are dying though
Elon: If you drive below 80, the car will explode. Driver: Here we go again. *Continues to drive for 8 min*
The driver is badass !🙂
A mercedes Gt63s with 639Hp is faster than a 1000+hp tesla around the track? Nothing new lol
Where 25k Tesla? Mr Elon? How long we should wait?
Is the car completely stock? Which tires are mounted?
This time is actually very slow considering the car has 1000+PS ... Comparing to Megane Trophy R which was 300 PS and did the lap in 7min 40sec. I expected plaid to do much better
Not too bad for a family car. Here's the record holder. https://youtu.be/KsLi7HgSuhI
Some says the legacy auto makers are catching up to Tesla...... Tesla : hold my bee...battery...
Yeah 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 🥰🥰🥰
Can anyone tell me who drove it?
Ahhh Tesla.. You know you've out-done yourself!
Top speed is almost 270kmh. But is not 320kmh?
What was done to the brakes?
The plaid curb and wall guards are a nice touch.  Touche Elon!
Can we PLEASE have the speedometer as an optional extra. Sell it, we want it.
Lol, and it was still speed limited to 165 😂
Terrible. No wonder sedans with 400hp less and same weight were faster than this. Keep it to the straight lines.
You can hear that engine roar
It's fast but hard to handle in a circuit. He's fighting the car every second!
Holy crap
feel like he was gonna crashed into something many times.
congrats for an amazing time.. must be an edge to be able to also hear the actual grip in the tires when driving. The con is very bad sound experience.
I wish the Model 3 had such a wheel!
thought this was in MPH for a while 😳
If you want to go from A to B.  Choose Tesla.
What is the data on the screen behind the yoke?
Good! Know we want to see the auto pilot doing it!
If improved brakes, wheels, tyres etc. become available as an optional pack selectable when ordering the car. Does the faster lap speed produced then also qualify for the unmodified production EV record?
Imagine the time it will achieve when the limiter is removed and it gets up to 320km/h in the last long stretch.. sub 7:30 for sure. ELON BRING ON THE SOFTWARE UPDATE ALREADY 🚀🙌🏽
Yesss 👏 ! Weel done ✅!
How uncomfortable seems to be that steering wheel
I don't think Plaid is for everyone.
amazing. one of the fastest cars that is also a family sedan.
when I said my heart skipped a beat, watching this clip is what it means
Strange, i must say i am a bit disappointed  with this time...i was expecting it to be closer to a SVJ (6:44) time not beaten by a m5 CS (7:29)
A couple of takeaways.  - car looks quick - is not driven in anger (lift and coast early in places, not utilizing full braking) - top-end is less impressive than one would expect, supposedly due to aero. - it seems like the general Tesla issue with steering feeling and feedback is still present.  I’m Proud owner of a Model 3 Performance unlocked, for fun sim racer, with some 2000 virtual laps at nordschleife.
I thought they were.aiming.for 7min5sec after 7min13 in 2019?
Oversteering Nd power sliding everywhere
Few tenths to be shaved off when the top speed gets unlocked? Impressive!
Must say, it is refreshing to see the speedometer in km/h for once!  Awesome driving, awesome to see they used the yoke, awesome time for a family sedan! Plaid is probably the best car on the planet rn.
my wish is the first EV drive in a " Ring Taxi " with this brutl beast
So what was the time??
Go Tesla Go! 🚀🚀
max speed only 268?
This porker is horrible in the corners and doesn’t look like any fun to drive at all.Thank god it has a 1000hp so that it can make up for its terrible handling  in the straights.
Wonder what the time would be if done by Autopilot 🤔
Are they kilometres or miles?
..absolutely stunning! Wow. Congrats... and cudos to ELON MUSK. Genius.
Not bad for the 50th fastest lap time at the ring😂
Congratulations for the new world record. Proud of you. Simply the best car in the planet.
@tesla Giving a plaid to Ken Block would be interesting
Sabine (RIP) would have been faster.
6:43.616	Mercedes-AMG GT Black Series.
You can tell from the sound of the squealing tires that this is a very heavy car. But very quick nonetheless. What was its time?
NEED FOR SPEED FLASHBACK
If you've ever played any racing simulators.. you'll know how hard this track is!!
Good thing its at least fast on straight lines lol. No surprise the time is meh.
Beat car ever
Car can go faster. Driver was hesitating. This means the car can pull much faster time   Tesla Bot: Hold my Charger
Sounds like the speed mode of the crisis power suit
Is this kilometer? What a amaging~!!!
All that and charging two phones?
Wow. As fast as a new m4 competition. That's the Future.
🤯
This is with top speed still limited to 163-165mph. Can't wait for them to release the restrictions.
Is this really a new WR?
Bye Bye Taycan 👋🏾🤫
I love the audio 👌
Hmm. So 12s faster than the taycan? A bit of a let down considering all the fuss elon made about an allegedly handstopped 7:13 time. 250 more hp than the taycan, the 12s faster time feels a bit lacking imo, im pretty sure porsche would make more out of 1000hp in terms of lap time.
I'm surprised the door didn't fall off
The tires are the real engineering marvel here!
Das Auto ist schnell.
And its not even the Plaid + 😯 Elon's not kidding around when he said the Paid is good enough!
and this with it's 155mph / 260km top-speed restriction in place.  Would have easily gone sub 7:25 without that.
Driver?
why did they need a different dash?  bcs real one lies about speed or bcs its not an actual production car?) its very likely they lifted some restrictions minimum. overall still huge progress. congratz
Clarkson will never forgive The Stig.
that car is so heavy it sounds like the tires are dying a thousand deaths at every turn.
Man I'd love to see a tesla join a race
roadsters gonna be even more nuts !
My stomach tingles when I watch at this.
Impressive lap, what is the fastest time on this track by any car?
think I have enough in-game racing experience to do this
A comfortable quiet 4 door sedan that could have child seats in the back, shopping and a bike in the trunk runs low nines in the quarter and 7:35 at the Nürburgring. The world has gone mad - I love it!
can you do this also on autopilot?
I love the sound of the engine!
Tank you Tesla.
Wow - how good is the driver
Round steering wheels: Am I a yoke to you??
Thanks for not adding any background music. Good Nurburgring ASMR.
Driver pushes through every corner then gets to straight and has to sit on speed limiter. Cruel.
Bravo! It reminds me of the RUF “Yellow Bird” lap. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OSMCfPASImQ
The Tesla Bot drives a little fast, IMO.
Shitty ass and impractical steering wheel
Top speed needs improvement. Driver errors need improvement. Easily 10-20sec lower lap time
Why there is no video of autopilot doing this circuit..
Balls of steel!
And after that all the birds and animals are still there!!
Not 7:05 as Elon first proclaimed for the Plaid+
Terrible handeling turns
Is anyone else just watching the speedo! What are the green lines I see moving there?
I want to see this car race other supercars, would be so cool, electric versus ICE. I wonder how hot the battery gets when it's pushed this hard...?
Feels like a spaceship 😍
Congratulations to the people at Tesla for the new record  Think Tesla is not going to wait for Porche to catch up. Tesla now has the EV production record and can now upgrade Plaid for an even faster Nurburgring lap time in the spring/summer of 2022. Tesla is likely working on a track package for Plaid. The brakes are known for overheating in the first corner... it's not that brakes are bad it's just that Plaid is so incredibly fast and has too much weight for what the brakes can handle.  -Lighter and a little wider Alu forged rims - Michelin Cup2 Tyres (maybe +10mm wider) - Round steering wheel (wouldn't hurt) - "Track Mode" (maybe already exists but, gets improved and custom-made for Nurburgring) - Ceramic brakes whit larger brake calipers. - 200 MPH top speed.  If Tesla implements all these and maybe whit some small aerodynamic upgrades, then Porsche will have a really hard time beating Tesla around Nurburgring for a long time ahead.   Rimac (in the future) and Nio doesn't count since they are not production car.
Tesla was able to do the lap in 7:13 so whoever this driver is, he's off by .22 seconds.
Awesome and mindblowing to watch. Wowzers.
Stig's got a new job
That is impressive stuff right there. Some of those cornering had me holding my breath. Incredible driving.. Tesla really doing bits! Kudos
Way too much understeer. Can't see how this would be fun to drive on track.  This car is only good for highway and freeways and straight long roads like the ones in America
Taycan officially WHOOPED. 7:42 for taycan. Seems like that yoke aint a problem at all
Well we all knew it would be faster than the taycan :D Driver looked like he wasn't even pushing too hard, just cruising at some of the earlier passages.
소음도 없고 안정적으로 빠르네!
He's using the yoke.
No track mode? 🤯
those tyres though
Very nice! congrats but i am missing the top speed advertised @322 km/h on the last straight we got @ max 279km/h kinda big difference and there we lose a few seconds
I can feel the weight of the car during the corner....
Amazing Imagine what the roadster is capable of...
Lol they're trying to do like Porsche with the same straight to the point Nurburgring video
Ok.. you raised my curiosity Tesla. I love the Taycan but now, I’d love to try the plaid.
Can FSD drive on Nurbergring? And what would its laptime be after the pro driver trains it.
insane fast
Incredible !!! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Tesla releasing this at 11pm shows they really don’t care about algos or best practices.. they just do them.  Respect.
Top speed limited to 268kmph??  Isn't it capable of 320kmph? 200miles.  So there is still some time to gain.
And people don't like That EVs don't have engine noise.  That futuristic wine coming out of the corners is sick
Why have engine noise when you can go faster instead? I like the quietness very very much!
OMFG!!! how is this possible?!
With Speed limited to 163mph
The car's sounds are more futuristic than its interior
Love that exhaust sound brrrrrra
This car is like flash
I wonder what kind of time FSD would get if it practiced this track over and over.
Now it's time for the model S plaid modded for track to set it's time
Are those km/h or mp/h ?
Wow! Watching the speedo - KPH or MPH? 😁🙃😎👍
Did they use regenerative braking and regular braking or just regular braking?
How odd that there is no roaring engine! Wouldn't it be cool if a dozen or so electric cars were all competing? What would that sound like?
Amazing. Just wish the speeds / track position would have been added to the video.
A Lot of play in the steering
This car will go faster..  you can hear with the great audio, that his “see-sawing” of the wheel is costing way too much time, and added unneeded heat to the tires.  A smoother driver would crush this person’s time, IMO.
Please Unlock 200MPH !
Cool video! Really fast! Now please post the next lap that ended crashed into the barrier and being dragged off covered by a tarp. That would be cool too!
Scary AF without actual steering wheel.
True story.... The car was on autopilot. He was just playing along.
That is seriously quick! Awesome to hear the tires squeak around the corner too
Faster than civic type r
Oqu'c'estqu'oltrouvonslaforce
Now do it without a driver
Cool, cool, now go to a track with sharper corners that require more than a 90-degree turn of the "wheel"
Notice it's actually a stock car, not some specific special edition with wings, wr, brakes and super sticky rubber that they are only making a few hundred of and calling it production.  Lots of time still on the table with some tweaks too
If you guys had a proper steering wheel that car could've gone low 7's.
Nice display ! Any info on this (brand, model) ?
The Mercedes EQS has a much longer range, though...
So Tesla has the fastest car in the world. Everyone’s $2 million dollar cars are going to get smoked by a $140,000 sedan 😂
You can feel the weight of it in the corners, tires really working but amazing for a sedan to be able to handle the track in such a way.
Elephant wallowing in the mud. Car's very heavy-weight and not at all suited to track work. Publish the lap time tesla and we'll see. If it's like other tesla models, the brakes and the battery will overheat long before a single Nurbergring lap is completed. Anyone who believes tesla is a drivers car as opposed to a drag sled is going to be sorely disappointed.
What tyres used?
Next video, using FSD V.10 and the pilot is seatting on the back seat !!!
Just a slight pucker at 3:56
Can't wait to see lap times with a fully modded plaid!
how many Wh/Km was it burning through out of interest?
Never saw so much Tesla fanboys in one place together That's definitely cool car, but Im petrolhead to the end.
Congrats to the driver and the team and Tesla for making such a sick ride. Terrifyingly fast.
Top speed limiter?
A Plaid Tesla Model S has set a new electric lap record at the famous Nürburgring Nordschleife racetrack in Germany, with a laptime of 7:30.909
Is this a world record ?
Impressive, it nearly took off at one point.
Not sure anyone can argue that electric cars have not surpassed petrol and diesel for anything other than speed of refilling at this point.
Don't forget to indicate when passing!
Awesome incredible performance  And also scarier than horror movies.
Porsche Taycan 7:42. Ok In German i would say WZBW. "Was zu beweisen war".  You told us you'd come back and show Porsche "Wo der Bartel den Most holt".  Thats actually jiddish and means where the competitor thinks he knows exactly whats what.  Mission accomplished. Job well done. 👍 Now i wait for the answer from Porsche. It will be interesting!
For comparison, the Porsche Taycan Turbo came in at 7:42.34.
Nah... It did not look stable
Very disappointing laptime tbh
Wow! enjoyed every second!!!
scarily fast!
Who's the pilot?
Who the hell is driving? Elon, be that you?
It's a pity that they didn't put the speed on the video.
To be clear; The Speedometer is not in km/h. 🏁
Are they phones on the recharge pad?
James bond car should be Tesla not Aston Martin silent killer
268
Holy Crap! That Batmobile Batman!
I wonder if it was driving itself, could it do a better time?
Almost lightning fast! So impressive!
Why are the shift lights not working? :p
shouldn't it drive by itself by now?
3 sec. slower than the audi r8, impressive.
That’s some f1 type steering
Imagine what it will be like when full top end is unlocked.
Man that jerky steering driving me nuts lol could shave another sec or 2 off it, autopilot maybe ?
Can you write software that will perfectly pass this route? Without a driver
PLAID TESLA.....QUEEN OF THE ROAD! You better believe it....and 'l mean that'.       :)
GET IT!
Wow @tesla @elonmusk
Hoping to recreate this in Gran Turismo 7 I’m March
I'm tyred out just watching that.
Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT did 7:38 with 631 horsepower and an SUV body. Model S Plaid is clearly lacking in the handling department.
i wonder what happens with autopilot
Folks at Edmunds must be really pissed off now ^^
Wow well done a great fast lap ! Very impressed with the drivers skill !
Okay cool and all, but c'mon lets give my mans some racing slicks so he can get that cornering confidence. He was definitely holding back for fear of his life at quite a few points during that lap xD
"You cannot drive with yoke" Ha!
I wonder how fast autopilot can do this when it's ready...
Is this a record for all cars or just EVs?
Well this video proves that teslas have motor sounds 🤣
This wasn’t his first time there
the sound of it accelarating <3  in love with that most satisfying sound ever
tEsLas aRe ONly gOoD n A strAigHt LiNe
Scary at 7:29. Car looks heavy, but sounds great.
😵
*Respect for that driver♥️🔥*
*_All that sliding actually slows the car down. Bring in Randy Pobst and he will blow that _**_7:35_**_ time away easily. Keep in mind he won the Pike Peak Hill Climb in his class this year with a Tesla Plaid._*
Fun to see he follows the exact race lines that I get suggested in Project Cars 2!!
Tesla the most underrated track toy sports car.
The Car Drives at 230+KM/H💥😬🔥  check the dashboard.
Where can i buy the extra dash? :P
imagine all racing game if you choose tesla then there no sound... Hold your fart.
Disappointing result . Only 8 seconds quicker then Taycan Turbo which is the smaller brother of Turbo S. Where is the 7:20 (sic. 7:05) laptime which was promised in autumn 2019 ?
Imagine if the speedometer was mph😳😳😳
How much Battery did it use??
Is this mph or kmh?
1) The driver is giving it everything! 2) I thought they'd deristrict the car's top speed for the record attempt
kul
2.2 ton car at 120 mph: ok we’re turning Tyres: _reeeeeee_  *Very* impressive performance. Tesla development is frankly astounding. Pop some wings on this and you could probably straight line the back half of the circuit ;-) But the stock dash _really_ needs a accurately reporting speedo (see my other comment).
Who's that driver? He's insane
🤘😎👍 What an awesome feat to be done by a 4 door sedan. That lap time puts it right around the top 50 lap times on the track. The entire top 100 list is littered with some of the most iconic and powerful *Sports Cars* and its a 4 door sedan... wild!
*starts breathing again... I think what impressed me the most was how little time he spent actually accelerating. Out of the corner, and by the time he was straight he was letting off and coasting to the next corner!
Nurburgring is my favorite track, tesla is my favorite car.  *I'm happy af rn!*
Strip the car's frame, code Autopilot to go 300mph, boom
km/hour on the speedo?
scary speed needs strong safety in that car , who don't wish to have it to bad so expensive for us 😣🤦‍♂️
cool... tyre screeching is all that you hear.... i would love to know how it handles with that yolk steering wheel... i mean ... not wheel
167 mph in 1st gear! Wow it gets to top speed faster than my washing machine.
Best video game driver ever
passenger is laying flat from the inertia
The fact that you could literally throw a few car seats in the back of this car for the kids amazes me. Future’s looking brighter because of tesla
Amazing, but I'll buy one when they offer a standard steering wheel and stalks for everyday driving !
Another new record!! What a great car!
km/h, right? why is it not upgraded to 200mph (320km/h)?
Now put it on an oval track so we can see the top speed sustained as well as the launch.
Whow😍. Thanks to the driver who brought this data to FSD for us all. 🤔😎😎😎😎
Here before 40K views♥️
What are the guages on screen? I assume its temperatures?
Schwedenkreuz was scary 🔥💀
They finally did it! I just ordered a model 3 but now I want a S Plaid!
I cant stop watching this! The warp drive whirl of the motor and the shredding of the tires in the corners (sound like a tie fighter) are 100 times better than listening to the rumbling and revving of a petrol engine
ooft imagine that 1020kW of regen braking 😍
Highest speed I observed was 267.
cruising down the highway at 267-8 kilometers an hour. damn!!!
45 Model S plaid later......
I wonder how much battery left after those 7 minutes.
Hello sir.  I see that is really fast  achieve speed
Dont worry buddy...i shit myself for you 😱🥴💩
Can all the Teslas get Racelogic dashes then? Because that overread on the stock dashboard speedo is awful. If you’re making any car capable of 150+ mph, at the very least have it accurately report its own speed for safety’s sake if nothing else.
Like the video before watching 👍
The yoke is not a joke!
And just think - the top speed he reached was 263 kmh, which is 163 mph, which is the current soft cap. Apparently the 200 mph top speed will be unlocked at some point in the future - and then they'll have to re-do the nerdburger lap. Imagine what the lap time will be with the speed cap raised to 200 and the addition of some aftermarket aero + carbon ceramic brakes. Crazy!
Dear Tesla, please disclose the name of that fearless driver!
Not sure if its just the camera but it looked like there was 0 body roll it looks amazing great job Tesla
I am impressed, almost as fast as a BMW M5 and with only 400hp more.
the times it went to 260 jesus wow
Tesla plaid power.
What is the top speed
Amazing
Impressive drive. That yoke is made for racing. Nice save at the carousel! I wonder who is the pilot.
Amazing driving skills 🔥
YES!
5-door Family Sedan btw. Unmodified btw. Available to the public btw.
🚗 I left a little car in the comments. I hope it brings you happiness (sorry there is no Tesla car emoji available).
This perfectly proves that higher Horsepower doesn't mean you're necessarily faster around a track. The 635HP M5CS runs 7:29 (20.6km) in sport auto tests, which is usually at least 5 seconds slower than official laps.  TBH I'd expect a faster lap with over 1000 HP.
Well I think we can all agree the critics were correct and replacing the steering wheel with a yoke is both dangerous and makes the car undrivable….ahem. It’s just as well that all the other manufacturers aren’t kicking themselves that they didn’t think of it first.
Can't wait to see how fast the Model 2/E will do without steering wheel.
Now do this on autopilot!
Chime  “ can you get some  milk on the way home?” Single tap to reply Double tap to dismiss
Tesla for the win
not bad for a daily ;)
Hey Elon you should put solar panels on next tesla model they will charge it moving 😃
Holy moly this is incredible considering it’s a family sedan I’ve just ordered one in red
Doesn't feel best without the sound of an engine but decent lap time.
I the dashboard in miles or km hour?
If you taught autopilot to do this without a driver could it beat that time?
Just on the correct side of "out of control".
Just like Mario Kart!
ನಮಸ್ತೆ.... ಶುಭವಾಗಲ್ಲಿ ನಿಮಗೆ  👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👍
Those sounds are skeeeetch 😅
That final straight is where a lot of other cars could close the gap, and why Tesla needs to unlock the speed limit to 200 mph asap!
Hey TESLA.. try putting a production car on the ring.
Merci 🙏⚡️❤️
Didn’t miss a single shift
I'm all about Tesla, I am; but NO one needs a care that goes that fast.  I mean no one.
It looks like he's flying a fighter jet
One I need one
Plaid makes such a refreshing wiiiiiiiz sound.. WAY BETTER than ANY steam engine 😅🤣
쓰레기 차
Im guessing stock tires on?
Fast, aesthetic, modern futuristic, and most importantly affordable. That’s a car.
EPIC😵 🔥 💯
My god, who’s the pilot? F1 driver?
Wow… that driver is awesome 👏… I wish I can get a tesla one day ❤️‍🔥
Nice RC car
Too bad your OEM parts and used car policies are so anticonsumer. I really would love to own a tesla one day
Is the steering ratio changed to suit the yoke? Even the the track focused GT2RS has almost twice as much steering rotation in the first corner
I was waiting for this 👍⚡️👏
felt like i was on a roller coaster / in a spaceship
Amazing.
que absoluta barbaridad haha
Speed limited at 268 km/h ?????
why is the speed at original screen and the attached one different?
Are these stock brakes and suspension? Tesla 7:36 vs Taycan (300hp less) 7:42 = not very impressive.
You can even hear Teslas quality interior. 👌
The sounds are just beautiful
Awesome Leader Awsome Team Awsome Company TESLA 😀
Love seeing how quick this thing accelerates.  Really impressive as well as the handling for a 4 door sedan on the ring.
Driver has balls....and skilzzz...one of the safest cars in the world
Is FSD operating in shadow mode?  Will FSD learn and/or train in DOJO to race autonomously?...potentially race in Roborace? You can potentially increase lap time with less weight!
The sound of the electric motor is to die for
100-200까지 속도올라가는게 미쳤구만,,
So cool to listen to what the tires are doing when you don’t have to listen to that annoying ICE exhaust!!! 👍🏼
So did it make Taycan or not?
pls remove that damn yolk... For everyday driving its a pain in the ass.
The porsche gt2rs makes this x box on wheels look like a joke with 6.43 at 189mph fastest production lap ever
That's insane. Is this completely stock? there is no mention in the description, and I can see a few added on switches.
is it 266 km/h top speed achieved?
I love the speed of the W16 engine.
Just imagine what If Tesla release two wheeler EVs
Butt puckering stuff
Imagine hitting a moderate corner at 230kph?!?
Would love to see a track pack with better wheels/brakes/aero. Steering wheel seems light at high speed?
Car still limited to 167 mph🤔
I can drive it faster 😁
Is that window crack from chassis flex?  Couldn't help but think...."no, i don't want no scrub...."  Fast car no doubt
Sheeeeeeeeesh
I would need a Tesla bot to launder my undershorts if I was the passenger here.
According to Elon's words  it's a "Completely unmodified, directly from factory" but  in reality It's a heavily modified Plaid, On the footage we can clearly see the aftermarket dash which is always used with an aftermarket VCU and we also can see a "not stock" control panel under the media control unit.
They shoud have shown how to compares to the others cars, but that was awesome.
This car is so unstable. He is risking his life to drive this drag car.
WOW.   Just WOW.
Funny that it has speed limit signs. He passed 30 at 114, that’s expensive :D
Wondering if Tesla will go back and shatter the 4-door sedan record held by the AMG GT 4-door. I am sure it can be done!
Driver looked scared.  He drives it so it never has traction. Would be faster if he didn't always want his tires skidding to make some noise
Audio is so clean...just wind and tire sounds. Sometimes the Plaid motor.
Still software limited to 163 mph. Fall 2021 is when they will release the update that allows the full 200 mph, right? So it should be able to do even a few tenths faster with that update.
is it fair that he has a map of the course?
Amazing!
Jeff be like okay imma sue them for this 😂😂
That acceleration is nuts!!
Who was the driver? Could Timo Bernhard drive the Car. I guess, he drives under 07:15
Missing the speedometer
The Green Hell has never been this quiet.
I am wondering how fast this will be with race tyres and carbon brakes.
Remember that a Plaid Plus was once planned.
I get people saying "...and this is just a street car"   I think the phrase super car has just been redefined.  This isn't "just a street car" ;)
7:05 he’s flying on the GPS
So when Lucid??
when I`m in rush, I hope this car and the driver will be my uber... also hope these driving skills will be implemented to FSD :)
Eyes can’t believe that the Plaid still in one piece 🧐 impressive for an all electric ⚡️ car…mind boggling shit 🔥
But can it drift? 🤔
Anyone else noticed how the video ended when the speed was 69? 😂
The video description is wrong, there were two cars, the fastest setting 7:30, the 2nd fastest was 7:35. Where is the fastest record video?
Bit hairy at end of last straight 😳 There was a couple opportunities to accelerate and brake harder, I definitely believe that time could be trimmed.
Holy canoli 🚀😄. Taycan WHO 🙈. Tesla engineers you guys are awesome 👍. Action speaks louder than words for naysayers out there 😄😄.  Next time Elon release the Kraken 😄😄.
속도계 mph는 아니겠지??
And this is with no mods 🔥🔥
Is the speedo in kilometres or MPH?
i am pretty sure the driver had a lot of fun , i mean always having that instant torque even in high speeds and feel it looks so cool in video who knows irl
does this beat the Porsche Turbo S at 7 minutes 42 seconds ? ie 7 seconds faster ??
1:23: Brake overheating warning chime? :-D
Incredible performance, and I can’t wait to own a Tesla…   But the creaking of the cabin is killing me.
Woah
Crazy
Embarrassing lap time for a car with more than 1000hp. Really painful to see the car struggle at corners. Can’t even compete with ICE with half of it’s horsepower…
nice work team T !!!
In case anyone is interested that's a 7:36 +/- 1 second timed from the gantry before the first bend. (Probably not the best place, in a braking zone)
I know this map from video games so it’s cool to know every corner without ever seeing this before
The cars seems to go so slow without a engine screaming his ass off.  Super strange to look at especially with that steering wheel. But totally loved it. ❤️
Best the Porsche Taycan.
God speed
Now I know why we needed a yoke steering
Very exciting that Tesla cars will now be built in Europe.
This car really don't like to be on a track, look at the driver fighting the car... good driver tho. Look how much easier a GT2 is to drive with minute faster laptime: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-wVpNdxdtw
Incredible engineering! Congratulations TESLA! Couldn't be any happier being a shareholder!!
Amazing😍
"Honey could you please pick the kids up from school after you done setting the world record?"
It’s a good thing no ones walking around
Jeff Bezos is going to sue Nürburgring.
wow!
Looks fun.
I'm seeing quite a bit of lift and coast (regen in this case), guessing that the brakes are nearly on fire. Stick some CC discs on and you'll get it down by a nice bit...
Great lap time. I think with some upgraded tires, a better driver, and remove that top speed limiter you still have tons of time to shave off.
The ultimate emotional drivers car
mph or km/h? If the first, holy fuck, but I'm guessing it's the later because of where they are
I think you should publish the -200m time (about 7:30) along with the whole lap time. Most of the manufacturers publish -200m time without annotation.
The tires are struggling. The model 3 has potential for setting a better lap cuz it's lighter. Only if the same model s motors were in the model 3
how would autopilot take this course?
this is unreal , i cant believe normal people will drive this on the streets
That was dope af.
Imagine the top speed not governed and increased downforce 🤯
Give me a full steering wheel
Plaid means tire torture test car 1.  ;-)
What a boss 👏👏👏👏 Just how quiet is one of these cabins exactly!
top speed i noticed was 269kmh which is 167mph just about. Phenomenal !
Awesome. Now do a modified car!
Welp, it really needs better tires. Amazing lap especially given it's all stock. Can't wait to see what they can do with some basic track mods.
Its called Nürnbergring, with e
Awesome! What tires were on the car?
Can't wait to see the Roadster on this track
That thing looks heavy
2.1ton chassis. fast but not fun. a bit painful to watch really. it literally understeers into every single corner, having to accelerate very late to prevent further grip issues and only rely on high power/torque to make up the time when not in corners. basically a drag car in a grand prix circuit.
gonna download the sounds for random asmr :)
Wow plaid is plaid 👀
And now with autopilot
5 ⭐️
Is that a phone in the wireless charging bay?
It's early days & will get a good few seconds off that time when the correct rims & tyres are fitted so that the speed limiter can be taken off.At the moment the limiter is about 260kph I THINK. I do hope Unplugged get to wave their magic wand over it & for it to be all factory approved a la AMG/Mercedes.Then the times will drop to its true potential.
Imagine if Tesla set out to make dedicated super cars, with downforce and track oriented suspension and handling
some say EV's have no soul due to lack of noise.  I bloody love the sound of this, It fires out of the corners like a spaceship at warp!  Awesome! :)
Tasla = satisfaction + performance
Perfect car for when the kids are late to school
such a quite cabin at a very high speed ,  truly  amazing!!!!
Plaid is no yoke
Haters: I like my toy to say “vroom vroom”
People say electric cars are boring because they don't make sound: well this sounds like a bloody spaceship with a warp drive
Boom Baltic.🔥🔥⚡⚡
Me: This is Effing amazing! Also Me: The Poor Tires on that Tesla!
a 7:35 is the same time as the F90 M5,  R35 GTR got a 7:36
Respect for the driver. Excellent performance.
WOW
This is freaking awesome!
And with a yoke..
Damn, that is a dope racing car, JOIN F1 AND TESLA IS GOING TO WIN!
Insane performance for a 4-door full size sedan. I want one!
Needs better tires…😂
Judging the drivers physique id say it was Mr.Musk himself driving :D
Acceleration out of corner is just mind blowing although the handling around the corners and the straight line top speed is not as smooth or great as GT2 RS MR.
A map theme from asphalt 9 would look amazing on that screen instead of that top down kind of maps.
It's terrifying to watch.  Power is insane for an everyday sedan
All I kept saying was “FUCK”!
hmmm looks like the car's speedometer is a bit of a liar.
that's MPH or KPH?
That steering wheel is honestly so dumb
Time?
Porsche Taycan 7:42
The AI driving should to reach a record under 7min 😆
Love these videos 😍
Tesla fucked all those Germans sports cars  ....
what kind of tyre? It's fast but not as fast as I expected. How tuned is it? I need more info to actually decide whether is it fast.
2:52 4:17 The acc is crazy even in comparison to GT3 or else...
I own a version of this car.....
Tesla Plaid goes Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Самый невероятный автомобиль в индустрии!!!
What kind of muffler do you use? Its so quiet!
I think the plaid can more faster if unlook max sped!
Don’t forgot that it’s also one of the safest cars ever produced.
I saw 267 on speedometer.... XD
Power full
Super Plaid!🏎😲
Amazing!??
Not bad for a family sedan!
Just when you thought electric cars were going to save the planet…
And that car is still limited to 163mph on the straight!!!!! Imagine when its unlocked for 200mph!!!!!!!
Well thaats shit. 7.35 is shit..
Don’t panic… wait ..does he have a racing harness on? 🏁
So 1000 hp is only good for a 7:35. Hunk of s###
Only need to shave off 50 seconds and you can have the production car record. 😂
It's governed at 170mph...yawn
Man that is fast. I would NOT want to be a passenger for that :)
that steering wheel is idiotically dangerous
🦍
Hello fans, SuperGT here!
The driver looks a little heavy set… is this Elon driving?
wow!
here comes the butthurt ICE comments
This was almost nauseating... I'll have to rewatch when I'm not drinking.
Stig, model Plaid ..
Great performance, amazing that this is a production car and is still beating multimillion dollar stripped down cars. Tesla never ceases to amaze.
Tesla's autopilot: AAAAHHHH 😱
Tesla is like my dream car. Not lambos, no bmws.. tesla pog
Would be intresting to know the average consumption during this run.
Tyres are screaming more than the engine lol
still speed limited to 270km/h max instead of 320km/h??? you can see on the long stretches that for seconds we are at limit - is this for tire specs or just powertrain limit for now?
Hats off to the driver, I know it must of been a beast to tame, what with all that weight and that god awful yoke.
TESLA RALLY
Yolk steering wheel is cool but not as safe because alot less surfaces to grab. Unless the steering will only turn say like from 10 o'clock to 2 o'clock.
What about Top Speed? Homepage 322 km/h. On Track not more than 270 km/h?
We need some data: Speed, GForce, and Laptime would be great!
Looks like this car still has quite a bit of understeer, I was hoping they'd work on fixing that for their top of the line performance model. This could be an incredibly good handling car with proper suspension setup thanks to the weight distribution and fully configurable AWD. A bit more mechanical oversteer and power delivery to the rear wheels and it would be much more engaging to drive and a bit quicker through the corners as well.
90 to 200 acceleration is just *UNREAL*
is that mph or kph?
Tires: aw aww awwwwoooowww aaaaawwww  aaaaqq aaaaqqqqhh
and the Civic Type R did a 7:42 on his stock form
Wonder how fast FSD could do this?
its kind of strange for me to watch a Tesla (not a hater but a HUGE fan boy of the company) run on the Nürburgring and not hear an engine roaring outside the car. but it just feels like it a car going down hill without its engine on. still pretty cool and gas powered engines watch out because electric cars is coming for your a... i mean going to take over the world soon.
Just a 2 ton car driving faster than many racing cars. No biggie....
Impressive
First Person View would be badass!
How to make 4 tires bald in 7 minutes *
Elon giving me a personal Tesla plaid 💙😂 hand delivered in my dreams
So tesla did it in around 7:36 and the Porsche Taycan in 7:45. It's both fast.... So in my opinion no clear lead. But the Tesla is the way better car anyway!
Imagine the money Tesla could make if they started a new race genre with this.. Like Formula 1 but with electric cars. Supply the engine / battery pack, let the teams build their own chassi / suspension etc. Just like in F1. The amount of profit would be staggering in the long run.
Now, Taycan will be afraid :)
I would not want to do that for a living for sure
Норм жарит!
Hats off to the driver for achieving this with the yoke!
A "better" steering wheel would have been ideal
*Tesla Model S Plaid* - *_it's a flying car, sometimes..._*
Holy shit that car is fast
The sound is nice.
So crazy to not have engine noise. It would throw me off so much. Props to the driver
TESLA - Excellent, great job.
Норм тачка 👌
And now its time for fsd
HO-LY SH-IT this thing is right our of Star Wars. Might have to buy myself a Tesla
It's amazing how it can reach 150+ after each turns
Yes
Future is here
와… 개쩐다
Yes!!! That was f’ing cool
Sounds like these tyres were optimised for acceleration, not cornering
Goddammit i need this!! This vehicle is just insane 🤯🤯 I love Tesla!!
Almost never touched the brake pedal. If they figure out how to drop another 2-300lb this thing will be unstoppable.
A G-force display is missing 😄
Oh my god. Those corner exits look like they are on fast forward!
I’d love to hear what driver thinks of the yoke.
Wish I could afford a Tesla
Who is the driver?
Well that driver didn’t seem to have too much trouble with the yoke 😀. Only small steering inputs needed at high speed and at lower speeds you can get used to it
Your turn Rimac 😉
Quick question is the speed gauge in Kmph or Mph. Its in Nürburgring so im assuming its Kmph instead of mph but i just want to be sure.
When is TESLA joining an official race?
BMW M5 > this
No FSD?
As fast as an M5? I thought it would do better personally and compete with the super cars. still impressive but was hoping for better.
The stig goes electric
How fast can it go in FSD? :)
Tesla engineers: yep… i made that
badass!!!!!!!!!!!!!
looks like his driving a truck lol a very fast truck
Awesome🤩
THAT IS FREAKING SCARY
Great, now enter Formula E!
The acceleration is incredible. Can't wait for improved version. Thank for sharing! @tesla
Hell of a driver. Hell of a car. ⚡️💨🏁
That steering wheel is very bad
For those of you wondering, the fastest he went was around 269kph which is about 167mph
Now use that to train your Autopilot self driving algorithms.
The most amazing thing is that this is a electric car with such power coz there are cars that can’t give such power through petrol or diesel
Driver: My experience was amazing, It felt like I'm inside a video game but only with one life on the line.
It sounds like a space laser charging up.
Can you guys hear the creaking and stretching when he makes turns.
The tires make it feel so slippery! I remembered my Gran Tourismo rounds on the Nürburgring on my PS2 . Good times! I still know the whole track 🤣 Anyway this Model S Plaid is amazing!!
This is so beautiful to watch
This is wonderfully terrifying
Yoke steering wheel not even turned reaching 1/3 of the turn.
I can’t afford such a car like model s or s plaid. Am Indian so waiting for the model 3 and y to get launched in India first
how quaint
wow the world is so clean
What a dangerous and not ergonomic steering wheel..... Why it is still limited to 266kmh ????
thats one hell of a driver
To be honest, I'm actually not very impressed by this. Yes, Tesla beat the Taycan Turbo S, but not by as large as margin as I expected. This shows the weight disadvantage of EVs, brake over heating and tires to be the limiting factors/equalizers, over brute power. The driver was no where near the full power potential of the car in 90% of the track. Lets hope next generation EVs hopefully drop weight massively!
cool!
This is NO yoke !!!!
Man that seems hella fun to drive in
Truly got this lap time with pure factory spec?  Amazing!!!
😍😍😍😍😍
When the tires are the limiting factor...
This was the first time I got scared watching a video like this. The ICE noise hides all other noises that tell us that he's driving on the limits.
🇰🇷 아, 이곳이 뉘르부르그링이구나 그나저나 km/h or mile/h?  I watch 268!
Crazy seeing it go that fast and only hearing the tire noise basically
I knew there was a reason I never became a race car driver.
Looks like they only unlocked about 173mph not 200mph yet.
Is it Kilometer per hour right?
dream...
what is the average speed
I watched this video in a library
But Edmunds said!
I think the driver didnt even maxed out the potential of the car. Only 20kmh faster on the Schwedenkreuz than a Model 3 Performance. At 7:11 you can see how the car is also limited or the driver didnt push further. There are still some seconds left on the track.
those up hill speeds are crazy fast
New time record ?
Next step should be auto-pilot at Nürburgring.
Until all 4 tires are sheering traction 100% of the time, the limit has not been reached - Christian Von Koenigsegg Lets add cold gas thrusters - Elon Musk
Wii controller for the win!
wow one porsche tycan is crying somewhere now. well not one, actually all of them
The skill that it takes to drive like this without dying, is mind blowing!
Good job driver!
that was the best carousel run ive ever seen in my life!!
This is my most desired material possession that exists on planet earth currently.
Imagine plaid weight 1300kg only.
The plaid sounds like a spaceship. Alien technology 👽
7 seconds quicker than the Taycan
Wooup.
*Youtube will recommend me again after 5 years*
👍 INSANE 👍
Wonder how much faster it will go when they remove the 163 mph limit and turns it up to 200 as promised.
Vrrrr Vrrrrooooam Vrrrrrrbrrrrr     😂
YEET YEET
Those squeaks are normal even in their production vehicles
269kph=167mph! Interesting, this must not be the fully uncorked Tesla Model S Plaid? Top speed is supposed to be 200mph. You think that it would hit that on the final straightaway?
I thought this was going to be a BTG time :O So impressive!
Great lap
I couldn't take my eyes off the screen for one second! Awesome! Go Tesla!
Km or mile?
Hatts off........ Not to The Machine               But To The Human who took this kind of danger js To Test This Beast 🎩🎩 Js Amazing 😱😱
Put cup 2s on and unlock the top speed!!!
Tstig?
if the sound of the motor isn't coming from the speakers then it's quite good.. 😂
That acceleration is ludicrous
The speed in the monitor is in km/h or miles/h?
I bet the driver hated having to use that yoke steering wheel haha
Amazing! Even more so that those devices in the charging area didn't move. ((O_o))
To those who still think batteries are overheating on the race track..you were wrong
Un circuit impressionnant une maîtrise du volant sensationelle Un bon véhicule
Whoa!
Why is it still limited top speed? 🤔 Better time coming 🤩 Amazing sound and lap 😍
Is there any one from india vs🇮🇳🇮🇳
Porsche right now ... Nein! Nein! Nein! Nein! Nein!!!!!
The Tesla be like "bitch I AM speed!"
Holy fuck this man is a monster
Hi Stig! 👋
12 Taycan owners dislike that video
Guuhhhhh
.
Most records listed for other cars are flying laps and not full laps... hard to compare this time!
It sounds like a spacecraft
World's "cleanest" lap around the ring.
Give this guy a medal with the sheer size of his balls as a symbol on top of it.  Honestly, what a car, what a driver. Striking.
Greatest quotes from cinema (Breaking Bad + Batman + Star Wars + Joker) #shorts https://youtu.be/dgNpvWMbOAg
I miss the full round steering wheel
What's the driver name ?
"But the yoke isn't good on a track...." I find it so strange people still try to resist change when Tesla does it best
Time? 7:... 💪
And?
We need the track mode and the track pack brakes now!
That's slower then an RS3... Not impressed
Still limited to 163mph it seems.  It’s got some left in the ‘tank’!
offical lap time 7:35. Thats pretty good. :)
York is so uncomfortable even to look
7:11 seems like there's a difference of 10km/h? Also top speed seems to be 278 km/h (approx. 173mph)! Nonetheless, sick run!
One day I'll own a Tesla. I just know I will.
This is amazing. congrats!
Much WoW⚡⚡⚡🚀 Awesome Driving Rocket man! Now that's how you drive a Tesla Folks!!!🤩
Congrats. Well deserved! 👍
That yoke def needs variable input!
I wonder how that crack in the windscreen got there 🤔
now we wait for rimac nevera...
Knock the wing-mirrors off...  but then it wouldn't be "stock", fair enough. Sounds like you're flying a jet / rocket!
Awesome, what an amazing ride. Green hell made the Plaid tires roar 😅
Ohh boi💪🔥
see the stock speedo is off by 5
Oh, what a lucky driver, no police car on the track to crash in.  6: 05 track time  ... that is the real challenge.
yeeessssss
Top drive
Ok now do it in Autopilot
Incredible!
Low center of gravity is helping a lot in cornering.
This is INSANE!  Literally the best car ever made.  Thank you Elon and Tesla Team... can't wait to own one in a few years :)
Awsome congrats on a new WORLD record
GT7 is here for one particular driver.
Popular Opinion: Every single one of ya'll agrees his driftin' made our Day:
I need this car , Dear Elon Musk please introduce Tesla cars in india
Lovely 😍
WICKED Car
"The yoke is a joke." Lol.
Instant torque  Absolutely amazing  On top: quietness  Love Tesla  Doc Tesla
I love that sound. Just wheels screaming. Not the same old vroom vroom
„Stock“, they Said. But driving a 7:30 with Racing Seat, Well its not just for safety ..
That's cool, but how fast can autopilot do it?
🏁
Holy shit
Tesla is going to save the world!!!! ⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️
Looks like he was fanging 😉
It's not  officially a record
The acceleration feels like in an airplane !
Future is electric. Impressive for a 4 seater factory production sedan .🔥
Nice 👍
I’ve never heard so much tire squealing going around the corners, must be a combination of high power, racing compound tires, and vehicle weight. Or is it the lack of engine sound?
Elon please list me the name of the book for self learn in order I will be well qualified to work for Tesla company
How'd he do that with a yoke. He must be superhuman haha.
Alonso could have done it in like 20 seconds less. Way too much corrections on the steering wheel and this guy brake too early and too gently.
LOVING THAT SOUND! its like powering up in games! LOL
RIMAC NEVERA
I love the audio 👌
Nice
Finally a Plaid speedo in km/h
Damn it's like playing in my Logitech G29 :D Acceleration sure is addictive!  Driver seeing straight line be like, aaaaaaaaaaa :D
Incredible driving too, who was the driver?
And all this in a 4 door saloon unbelievable! Incredible Work!
Incredible performance for a production sedan! The power out of the corners and straight line speed is insane.  The tires are definitely fighting the mass through the corners.  Thus the lighter and even more powerful upcoming Roadster will have even higher performance and a lower lap time.
Roaster will probably lap the plaid.
THANKS FOR NOT PUTTING OVER THE TOP DRAMATIC MUSIC over the motor and road sounds!!!!
Doing that with 160km/h im scared just by watching lol
This thing is insane...if they are doing this things right now...bruh I want to know what the future awaits for us
Wow
Tesla for sure will be the dominant car of the future. I just can't wait till the day I can afford one.
Edmunds editors and staff gave this video the thumbs down.
Yuuuhhh. That is fast. And those tires😅
That's alright, the Porsche Taycan Turbo S at least is a lot cheaper because it's slower on the drag strip as well as the track, has almost 30% less power, offers less range, .ess room, no autopilot, no charging network, etc.   Oh wait, no, it's double the price of a Plaid?! No way! Gotta be a real friggin moron to buy a Taycan then!
the yoke is useless in a track, they said.
In Fenando’s voice: That’s steering wheel is a yoke!
16 bugs died on the windshield during the making of this video... RIP
It's so unusually, not to hear the engine voice through the video!
Porsche who?
LEGEND VIDEO - Ferrari 458 Italia was slower at 7 : 3 8... GO USA
And no engine noise - needs a simulated something to get a sense of speed/ acceleration
Badass car plus a badass driver= awesomeness
A mini action packed movie about Model S 💀💕
That moment when the video turns into a Forza Horizon 4 gameplay
Incredible performance wow!!
Is this an ASMR
Seems like a lot of understeer. But man is it fast
0:52 😭🥵
JESUS F$&KING CHRIST THATS FAST!!!!!
I guess they're confident enough in their design to both use the yoke and skip the roll cage.
That is a completely stock Plaid as well, stock brakes and tires.
Wow he did that on yoke steering wheel, now that is amazing lol.  Congrats on the new EV record.
watch at 2x speed it amazing

He was hitting 200 so effortlessly, OMG! Even the sheer mass of his balls couldn't hold him back.
monster senyap
Варпач ты тут?
Plaid: Released by Musk Also em: What a sequence
From this video looks like yoke sucks a bit, at least it feels like it sucks watching driver struggles with it
Really fantastic
Yesssss 🔥now where is the Teslacam footage? 👀

Amazing! It's still weird though to see someone not shifting on a racetrack. 😁

Clicked on this video faster than the plaid can do 0-60
"The Plaid is a one-trick pony. It can only go fast in a straight line”, they said.
Crosses the line at 0:04 and crosses it again 7:40, time is approximately 7:36
