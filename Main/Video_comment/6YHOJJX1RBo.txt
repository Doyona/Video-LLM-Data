I like that bookshelf tho, may i have it😂
Where is this tree house ?
What a lovely place to stay
i very much miss watching you go crazy adventures but actually just figuring yourself and your surroundings out sml
It's my dream 😭❣️
We shared childhood fantasies ma'am!
She’s like Matilda but older and has bills 😂❤
Can you imagine having this for your children at the bottom of your garden?! Wow. Love this tree house is it in the UK?
Heyy would you be able to tell me where and how you stayed here please? I would love to go myself thank youuu🤍
❤
Thank you for you 💙💙💙🙏✨
inspirational speeches :D xx luv ur vids
That was so cool!
Does anywhere know where this treehouse is located at
I relate sooo much with the skincare topic! I’ve been using so much stuff I thought was good for me and my skin did not like it😅 and now I’ve been traveling for half a year and just didn’t have space to take all the bottles with me, therefore cut down on all almost the products and my skin is thriving!! It’s insane what the skincare industry and the influencers are trying to sell you all the time when in reality it’ll mostly ruin your face
I recommend that you read the holy Quran, God's words do definitely bring comfort to the heart. It will change your life! Mental health included! ☺️☺️
I say I don’t like pasta but in reality I just don’t trust anyone to properly cook the pasta. Growing up the pasta was always way over cooked and rice under cooked.
Budgets is on top
Where was this treehouse? Can I get contacts of it please?
Being alone is so underrated. 💜
Wow that tree house looks like my dream home! It is absolutely gorgeous! This was such a cool trip Taz 😁👍
U mKe my mental Health  better
Where is this tree house? It's awesome n my dream to stay in one xxxx
How do you find somewhere like that? Please share!
I wish I could be in a treehouse I have never been in one before.
Can I just say? Your content has IMPROVED so much especially your editing KEEP GOING❤️❤️❤️
I wouldn't even care whether the key works or not, once I'm in I'd never wanna leave that house again
enjoy po ang pagtulog diyan
I like your video quality it's really good .
Any update from Cammie from the DM ? 🤭
My motto is this: There are worse things than being alone, much worse. I got married at 34, to a man 12 years older. And endured 17 years of mental abuse. He was my first in every area except kissing. He had over the years learned not to trust females, his first wife cheated on him. I was his 4 th wife and should have known better. Because of his mistrust. Which distroyed the love in our relationship. In the end I cared about him, but no longer loved him. If there is no trust, love dies. Plain and simple. He passed away in 2009, and I felt so free...with just my son and I. Life was good but my son wanted a real dad. As his was a sickly older man. And I looking thought I had found someone to fit in our lives. Nope! Big mistake!  Huge mistake!! Not going into details...just 7 years of bull crap. And wondering what am I doing? And being in my late 50s having to find work, as he left me when we had nothing. Telling me he would take care of everything once we were married. A big NOT! I'm glad to be out of the dating pool, there is a huge amount of rot out there😕.   So glad to be single, still not completely alone. As my son lives with me...but no romantic relationships ever again. And looking forward to being totally single, when he moves out, if he ever does.😉 Motto again...THERE ARE WORSE THINGS THAN BEING ALONE, MUCH WORSE.
Where can I book this treehouse Taz?! 😯
Love ur solo traveling vlogs. Why don't you visit Bangladesh?
♥️
Could you share those videos about being good alone... please!!!!!
I didn’t think budgens existed anymore the ones in London I knew all closed years ago.
Taz can you revist the recommended national food diets like the UK and 1975 Japanese videos. Loved these.
The part about being alone and society's expectations is so spot-on. I live by that. Mental health is my number 1 priority and it should be for every one of us. Love your content, I so relate <3
Taz is so relatable and I love her so much for that.
Really missed you Taz. Happy to see you again you really look better and glad that doing better as well. ☺️🌸
Better Help is incredibly dodgy and you should be more transparent that this is an advertisement (saying that it's a sponsored video is not good enough).
Im loving the new contenttttt💜
We can safely assume she wasn't murdered, since she edited and uploaded the video.... Phew!
Where is the location of this tree house would love to go here
She always struggles opening doors ahahahaha
u could model
can somebody tell me what the outro song is?
2 whole days partially living rough, well done such an achievement not.
finally, a skin care routine I can get on board with
A kindred spirit who also loved Peter Pan as a kid! 💚🤍🧚✨
This tree house is. Dream 💝
please don't use any kind of dye in a rental. so much can go wrong
i've never used skin care other than nivea soft to put on after contact with water. I don't understand why people use 20 products
This is one of my dreams <3
as you say "you really shouldn't eat in bed" im sitting here eating popcorn..in bed ..HAHA
You’re living my dream lol I’ve always wanted to live in a treehouse
clarse
I love the videos so much I wish they were longer ❤️
Great content. Love the tree house. Glad to see your back.
Amazing tree house!! Couldn't agree more about learning to be happy doing things by yourself. I'm single and all my friends have partners so I was waiting for them to be free to do things. Now I just go alone if they are free it'ss a bonus but I go to gigs etc alone now and have made loads of new friends along the way
BREATHING OXYGEN FOR 24 HOURS
Hey Taz, I just wanted to say that for the past 2 videos since you came back from the break you're glowing, you're full of life and ideas, as we can all see, I really like the new energy that you put out for the world to see, keep going in the same direction. 🥰❤ Ohh, also, loving the hair style, your hair looks healthier, it's glowing and it's fuller 👏👏
OMG! I missed you so much!!  I did not even know how much I enjoyed your videos until you did not upload anymore. So nice to have you back, Taz!! Woho.
wow taz! perfect timing! so far this week i found myself being sad about being alone but after watching that little chat you left for us, it definitely made me feel better, thank you!! 💖 p.s that library nook is goals!
I would LOVE to live in the forest, in a tiny tree house!! It seems so Cosy and calme, and hearing the nature during the day and the night is an absolute dream for me !! ;-) . Great video, Taz, thank you !! I admire how skinny and perfect you are, with all the pasta you're regularly eating 🤩🤩🤩. You're totally right to take the time you need for you and your health!
I have always loved your journey. Thank you for your realness! Also where is moon?
She nearly falls over then immediately a injury lawyers 4u ad comes on🤣💀
My clumsy self looked at the tie-dye kit and stopped in horror. It's one thing at home and another in an idyllic art managed setting where the vibe is everything and worth a lot of money.
🥺🥺 Don't chuck the books. Books are so precious ♥
OK the silence was DEFINITELY purposeful.  Girl, you're trending on every new vid!!!!!!!!  💪🏻 Xxxxx
Where is this tree house?!? I need to stay there
DOES ANYONE ELSE HEAR A MAN SAYING YEA YEA AT 15:13 WTFFFFF am i tripping
I used to watch your videos all the time, but randomly stopped a few years ago, today this popped up and my recommendations, and I'm so glad it did. I adore your content, and you're such a kind genuine human being. Glad to see you and interact with your content again! You're amazing! :D
Where is this placeeeee?????
Love this, does anyone know where this tree house is?
Ayooo my skin change after using centella moisturizer too! But i cleanse with a new born baby shower gel hahah they are really gentle and cheap so win win i guess hahahha
who's the man talking at the back in the end 😱😱😱😱 I'm freaked 15:16
countryside people when Taz said she'd never been to a Budgens ahahaha
I’m the same with skin care, always had clear skin and only used water and soap, then I started a full Hyram approved 5-10 step skin routine and it did nothing positive so I’ve gone back to basics with just toner & spf moisturiser added
We love the strong come back💕💕
On Today's News Headlines: Youtuber slips & dies in Treehouse; goes viral" 10:15 😋💕
That's great, but the question is, can you have a good time by yourself without being on camera?
Did anyone else find it upsetting that Taz didn't knock on wood? (8:51 ish) SHE'S LITERALLY IN A TREE. 😅
Taaaz, you always inspire me with your ways of living. Well, I am doing fine however I just enjoy watching your videos and for being in a 4th year of following you on yt and ig, I thought that this was a great decision of mine. Stay safe always and I love you. May God bless you. 💗
It’s crazy, your skincare is so good it looks like you wearing foundation
i liked the mix of nature with the wood and technology with the lights.   and i liked the 80's movie dance montage too. lol
Back to some classic ClickforTaz videos
Your luck with showers 🤣🤣🤣
I'm so invested in your video. Like absolutely luv this video I sat through and watched the whole thing without skipping. And 100% relate and understand what u were saying abt how it can often be good to be by yourself. Also yass u go girl ur skin is flawless by flawless I mean flawless Soo gooddd 💗💞
I love your channel btw how is moon doing
Can I just say that Taz’s YouTube presence really helps my mental health. I was feeling a bit down, and remembered that I could check to see what content she has posted.  Thank you for the effort in making the content you do.
what was the paste you put in your pasta please it looks so good x
Taz is so comforting to watch❤️
Girl your skin is GLOWING.
you're living my dream it's soo heartwarming
You do have a skin care lol! That’s a skin care!
favv person
Did you just throw someone else’s books…
Oh taz we know know u have been awayyyyy...and it's so wonderful that u can take a lot of time off for ur mental health compared to some of us that do not have the luxury to do so...yes it is a luxury when u can take a long vaca for any reasons and still get paid or has a job waiting for us...sadly not all of us have this opportunity :(
That being by yourself speech 👌🏽💛💛💛
Thanks so much for a 'being alone' talk. I feel insecure going somewhere just by myself, but I can see it can help to step out of my comfort zone 🙃 I bought a tent and I'm going for a solo trip soon!
I love you 3000 ❤️❤️❤️
Always amazing to see you upload 🙂
14:00 stop it right here, I thought you were dead 100% :D
Good Video ♥️! Can I ask the company for the tree house or the link?♥️🎋
please be my friend
Glad to see u again ..I missed you so much 💓  I used to check regularly if u had uploaded new videos ..glad to see u posting regularly
betterhelp is a scam and should NOT be recommended to anyone dealing with mental health issues.
I'm terrified that it could be such a fire hazard.
Taz just came back full force after her break. The videos are so creative and funny and entertaining
Being alone is better than bad company ❤️
I want that Charizard Shirt and the fact you like Charizard is so cute.
You're literally the cutest and I'm glad you're back.
I'm also one of the luckiest and bless people who have good skin without using any skin care 🥺!
Where are taz’s rings from
Taz edited this video and posted it. She did not die :)
i miss the "soated"
This is like an absolute dream coming true. I think anyone would've dreamed of living in a tree house. Taz, thank you for showing us how fun it is to live in that dream.
I missed you, Taz! Thank you for uploading! 🥺😀
You're inspiring! I love the little talk about being alone and enjoying your own company :)
The thing with me is that I prefer being alone (pretty much most of the time) than being with people. I go to the movies by myself most of the time, I prefer shopping alone, and I love staying home (I live alone and I freaking love it). But it has gotten to the point that I almost always choose to be by myself instead of going out with my friends and I know they are kinda getting tired of that, so it worries me that I'll lose their friendships. I also think about my future and I can't picture myself living with someone, the idea of it stresses me out a lot lol, but at the same time I don't want to get older alone, you know? Anyway, I'm going to enjoy being by myself as much as possible since I love it a lot. I don't have to get stressed about the future yet.
If I could be sweet (be sweet).  I know I've been a real bad girl (bad girl) ...🤾 Taz can we also get vlogs on the click for more Taz channel too please
i've just rewatched almost ALL of your videos and i see you posted this and it reminded me of when you stayed in a tiny house for 24 hours.. I LOVE THIS
We camped there years ago when they were building those tree houses! Such a perfect little escape!
If you put a towel on the shower floor it should help with traction when it's wet.
Nothings more humiliating than failing to use keys. Thanks for sharing I’m the same 😂
Aah so glad to see you're back on youtube, uploading videos again ever so often! Really missed you while you were gone! Happy to see you doing better and hope you're pacing yourself so you don't burn out! The tree house looks really cool! can't wait to watch!
Welcome back Taz! Glad you took time to take care of yourself! Hello all the way from Canada. P.S. I'm so jealous, that treehouse looks amazing!!
You can go back to having a skin care routine by using products containing niacinamide as it repairs the damaged skin barrier
This was my childhood dream and it's still my dream 😍
The only skincare you really need to a gentle cleaner and moisturizer. All the other stuff is lies. lol
Dude! You left us on a cliffhanger. Please let us know your alive. Lol
I could honestly never do that! Slay Taz!
You don't need skin products if you skin is fine. Cleanser, moisurizer, and spf. The rest is just marketing.
where is thisssss
Can someone please tell me where is the location of this treehouse? 😭
To be alone and happy ... I think all i need is money
As long as you are having a good mental health and comfortable in your skin , you are winning at life -Taz  ❤️   I m starting uni this year and defo I will put this in my room 🤜🏻🤛🏻
Oh my god I want to live in this house 😍
Taz has a old relation with doors that don’t open first time 😂  Keys keys 😂😂
You leave us with the suspense 😂😂❤️❤️
Can you tell us where you booked this? This idyillic
I really can relate about the skincare, cause back then I was putting a lot of products and it causes me to break about especially on my forehead and right cheeks, but now I stopped using anything, just washing my face with water and my face is clear!
Loved the video. Being comfortable and happy to be alone is the best thing 💕
You are so adorable 😍 I love watching you. You make me feel good . Yes we did notice and missed you during your absence.  I'm so glad to see you back making videos . Hope all is well and I hope you continue making your content.  We all love it , and I am sure I'm not just speaking for myself . Thank you for brightening up my day 🌈🌈🌈🌈😇😇
Blackberry wood! I love it there so much ❤️
Nice peek of one of Taz's pretty feet @10:22 😍......Ur welcome😉
loving these vids taz :')
2:36 Every horror film when someone has to unlock a door to escape.
I SEE YOU WITH THAT NEW INTRO AND OUTRO AND EDITING STYLE!!!! LOVE ITTTTT!!!!!
"You really shouldnt be eating in bed" Me: *stares up as I eat a sandwich in bed* uhm scuse me haha
Oh, that tree house is amazing! My father once told me after a break-up that it's better to be alone than lonely. That was 30 years ago & I still live by those words. For the most part I'm happiest when doing things on my own. & am more open to exploring & speaking to people while travelling,  etc, when by myself... I'm also more engaged in my surroundings that way.
omg i stayed at one like that a few years ago!! it was so cold haha and the shower was beneath the treehouse
It’s giving anime vibes
Welcome back I've missed ur videos. U make me smile as well as ur advice wen it comes to mental health. I do and a personality disorder.. and spend alot of time alone. But glad to see u bk and more food challenges. X
wheresyour shirt from 4,30 from
Hi Taz I'm in London.  Where is this tree house? Thank you if you reply 😊  Lovd You Lots ❤️
I just love and am obsessed with this girl
I like Alexander McCall Smith books. 🙂
taz watch wim hof videos on YouTube to understand why cold showers are so beneficial, it's mind-blowing :)
"as long as you have good mental health and you're comfortable in your own skin, you are winning at life" EXACTLY 👏👏👏 as i get older im also realising being alone is so much better than hanging out with people you dont vibe with
Hi Taz it's good to see you back x
the being alone and simply not wanting to be lonely so keeping around bad company is so damn relatable ur the best taz
not my dog falling on my face when she was stuck on the swing lmaoo
It's a delight to see you back, and doing such a delightful activity (It's also on my to do list). And indeed, mental health is so important.
Can't find any comment saying that Peter Pan was a villain.. so.. I'm not saying it 😅😅🙈
This treehouse is so cool!
You have the best ideas for videos icl
I love every video of you Taz. Very relatable and comforting♥️
🤯 Don't do that with books! Where are your manners?
love that little nugget of truth, they're always my favorite part about the video
Hey you made it through. Jokes. You can do anything and your an amazing person.
Taz: *I really shouldn’t be eating in bed* Me watching this in bed while eating a full meal 👁👄👁
I would love to use it as a writers retreat!!@
I wasn’t even 30s into the video before I got excited…you have CHARIZARD on your top!!!! 😱🥰🥰🥰
Anyone have any idea where this is?
the fact taz can never get into the front door of anywhere new, i-
living in a tree house was a childhood dream of mine and this video let me experience it)) thank you❤️
Can you also tell in the discription as to where this tree how was and the name of the agency?
You are my favourite genuine youtuber now
anyone know where this is???
LOVE budgens!!
So glad you had sm fun! God bless you Taz!🥰♥️🙏
THE CONTENT!!!!! Slay ACTUAL SLAY. Missed you more than words can describe taz 💛
Hey Taz!!❤😁
please always lock the door taz, your own safety is priority
Taz giving us the videos we never asked for but definitely needed.
Do you have a boyfriend taz?
Oo I love treehouses, but prefer hobbit holes / cave houses more - maybe do one of those too 👏.  The strawberries tasted so good because they were probably English and in season, we do the best 🍓 in the world.
Well done Taz. You're awesome. Great video as usual. I can really relate to your health problems. Thank God, God forced me to confront them, instead of trying to bury them.
Please can you share where this treehouse is? 🤗❤ xxxxx
Can we just appreciate how much love this girl managed to get that there are some people hit the like icon without even watching her videos?
Early Squad ✋ 🥰
You know that Peter Pan is another figure of death? He came to get all the dead children to bring them where they never grew up. Sort of heaven...  Movie destroyed. You're welcome 😅
I loved this video so much 💛
Are you still alive ?
Firstly , your complexion looks lovely and clear. I think I could live in that tree house. Looks like a fun place to be. I also relate to your comments on mental health in terms of living alone. It can be a challenge to get the right balance between living alone and positive time with other people. Your personality cheers me up 🙂
YOU'RE HAVING PASTA! IN A VIDEO?? IT'S BEEN SO LONG 😭😭
Damn, i always struggle with being comfortable alone and i still try to work it out. Somehow, watching your videos makes me believe that i can succeed in this path. Besides i'm always happy when you post, its like watching a good friend thriving 😂💙
Missed this content Taz is my comfort zone
i dont like how you disrespect those books. pretty poor behaviour
nice charizard t-shirt
Love the video❤️
Great entertainment🏡Taz 💜
I love watching your videos, I literally binge watch them over and over again when I'm bored
Beautiful videoo <3
OMG WHERE ON EARTH IS THAT? I NEED TO RENT IT FOR LIKE THE REST OF MY LIFE!
Thanks for the talk about being alone. I love being alone, but people definitely think it's weird! Being with other people is also definitely a bonus for me. But being alone is 💯 there is just so much to do and to learn and so little time 😱
I wanna live in that treehouse
The books though♥️✨
They look like dirty socks 🧦 oi taz
Is it just me or it looks like the whole video she has a blurry skin filter? 🤔
Taz: You really shouldn't eat in bed Me: Eating dinner in bed while watching this 🤣
