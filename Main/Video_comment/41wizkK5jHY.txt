i hope Ramos can become Captain and slap that Maguire
Ramos just wants to break Salah's arm again
People forget Mark said he would run around old Trafford naked if we won the league spread the word🤣
As usual ramos wants a new deal with madrid re a fat pay check so he uses united to off set that!😂😂😂😂😂😂we don't want him no way no how neva!!!stay at home like a a quaranteeeeeen!
No point getting Kounde. He’s a 5’10 CB this is the prem the most physical league in the world. We should get Konate or Upamecano instead they’re both fast strong Physical defenders
It’s not rocket surgery?
why go for kounde??? every air threats will destroy him .....and 70m   ??its worst
solksjaer wants players cos he knows he aint got great tactics so he needs individual brilliance of players on every position to balance for it. in truth a lot of people can see that united got great depth in their squad and numerous great players, its up to the coach to get the best out of them
Mark always say Ole is a working progress but how about we say he has hit his limit & just not good enough! If Arteta can out manage him who’s far more inexperienced then this excuses Ole gets are just papering the cracks! Let’s get real Ole needs to go in the summer
transfer window fail for M U Not Good Signings & Loose Top Finish
FMD Goldbridge, could you shout that intro any louder? Woke my dead gran with that.
Players should not have access to social media, you can't stop racism because of how easy it is to commit. Only way to stop this is to take down the accounts and disable media for players
Arteta is more better than ole they should try and find another coach.
Why did we let Pellistri go out on-loan?..The Clubs best natural right-winger...
Chong wasn't doing good at all at Werder Bremen, never started just subs and the fanbase grew more and more frustrated with him. He played with tunnel vision, only looked down and tried to run with the ball until he lost it. I'm sad to say it but I don't think he will be good enough for our first team... I hope he proves me wrong though.
I hope we don't buy Ramos, we are soon becoming an old man's team!
Rashford is much better playing off the left. its a waste playing him on the right wing.
I'm watching this on catchup, after Spurs and Leicester have lost.....more perspective goes onto that Sheffield United game we lost :(
Can’t even listen to anything with Ramos, Ronaldo or Pogba in the title.  I know you’re just repeating the news, I understand that, but boy it’s so tedious what the media do with all this BS year after year after year. Beyond tedious, unlistenable!  As for Ramos, I would be horrified if he, by some massive incompetence, came to United. One of the dirtiest players ever to walk the turf. Not worthy of our shirt.
We’re we looking at Pepe when he was from lile he would have been good for us
You can’t be someone who’s a “work in progress at Man Utd” especially if you’re in your 3rd year....
I dont agree with you how can you say arteta is good than ole arsenal is having a good forward than us so what are you saying
If Arteta is a better tactical coach then why are we ahead of them? Unless his tactics only work against Manchester United then Mark is deluded. If he was a better tactical manager he’d be beating all the teams we beat and more. They had a injury hit team last night but his full team still fell behind us.
I couldn't believe how he kept mctom on.  Mctom literally had to go down and force ole to change him
Idk know bout yall but...having a company to easy trace or contain your personal data out there under the mercy of said company is really shady
How tight is a duck's ass?
What he/she said: Really89 Once fooled, shame on you (Ramos). Twice fooled, shame on us (United). Ramos: “Get lost!”
WHAT RAMOS UNITED???😨
I think we play a diamond against Southampton. Magic/Fred at the base. Donny left side. Pogba right hand side and then Bruno as the CAM. This way, we have better build up play, (Donny). But also means we don’t play with wingers, where we’re struggling at this moment in time.
We all know Ramos is just using united to get a better contract
We don't need Ramos pls mark common come up with a story like opamakano not Ramos
We don't need Ramos pls mark common come up with a story like opamakano not Ramos
Whoever we buy for cd, will be sitting next to vdb...
We need grealish
Koubaily and pique or lenglet
Maybe get savic from Lazio
Ramos is good it doesn't matter about ages
Once agian: waiting from the first team on the table to loose points.. Why?????!
Whats Rocket Surgery Mark?  16:20
I think we are playing just not to lose . Ole is very nervous because if we don’t win he will be out. Draws are no good .
RAMOS, THE WAYNE-KER THAT CHEATS, USED US FOR A NEW CONTRACT WHEN HE WAS OF PRIME AGE AND NOW WANTS TO DO IT AGAIN WHEN HE IS AN OLD GOAT??..............ERM NO THANKS 👍
I.e. Sergio Ramos wants a new big contract and wants to use Manchester United's name to get one. 😂🤣😂🤣
Lol
Has anybody seen KG? Condom man been missing 🤣😂🤣😂
We need a defender anyway.
Did u not see the news that wants is most likely destination is psg? These Man U fans think they are getting everybody 😂😂
Lisandro Martínez, plays for ajax, age: (23) years old, nationality: (Argentina) Positions: Defender (Centre, Left), Defensive Midfielder (C), very good at passing the ball, likes to dribble with the ball, good at aerial duels, this is a player we should have brought in this month and could have partner with maguire or if really needed could played has our cdm, this player could have been the key to us winning the league this season.
of course he does. he's a 34-year old has-been looking for one last big paycheck.
@TheUnitedStand and Mark, I agree that all racism is wrong. But please do not argue for removing anonymity from Twitter and Facebook users in your attempt to combat racism. Think of all the people who live in countries where they have to fight to try to achieve democracy, democracy fighters lose their lives if they are exposed.
There is no point beating around the bush its so obvious to a blind man Ole is not good enough to be a coach in United senior team let alone our junior team no wonder this team can not win anything not even in ten years time so inept for my liking he is wasting VDB awfully sad
We not been fair to Marcus because he's being played out position.....he's always a better player at the left wing and our coach should know better than that
Julian Nagelsmann needs to be signed in the summer.  I love ole as a coach just makes costly decisions or lack there of for subs/ team sheets.
All these old players are trying to turn united to retirement home
No thanks Sergio!
21 is coming
What if we get him and use Sergio for specific games like Champions league ? Koundae would be good
We aren't celebrating a draw. We're disappointed with a draw but we're gakd we didn't lose
Wouldn't entertain Ramos, he used  us several seasons ago to get improved contract. He's even slower than Maquire! Don't go there United. He's not that good either.
Imagine A star that’s responsible for providing free school meals to children in the Uk helped feed your son/daughter and yet is being racially attacked... let that sink in , what a world we live in
On racism, look banning an IP address they can just spoof a new one. But every device has a code, phones, laptops everything which is almost impossible to change, if you ban that those devices will never be able to create a new account
Martial wife was getting abused
The mundane power philly approve because gray coronally dance without a joyous purpose. discreet, ahead gearshift
I agree ramos is old but I would welcome him as I think he would help boss the defence the way maguire should be and I also feel that's the type of partner maguire needs
So if Ole is learning on the job, how long are you guys giving him to win us something or his legendary status at the FC means a top4 finish w/o a trophy is acceptable?
Once again United fans are racially abusing players and goldbridge man utd fans are the problem that’s why Ed Woodward and glazers don’t take us seriously
Ramos used utds name to get a better contract a few years ago wouldn't go near him with a barge pole we need a young proper number 9
Kounde on top of the list I am happy
Manchester United fans are being used to sponcer Tampa Bay
Your man UTd but your not good enough. And your in the Europa lge.
He said the same thing about Liverpool  with konate.  So raise  your hopes there
Rashford on right and Pogba on the left is just plain wrong.....so don’t start with that!
Mark on Ramos you said the same about Carvani and look at the impact he has created at United even with his age and being injury prone.
Pau Torres, kamara would be a start too
It doesn't matter who we get to play the number 9 role, we will always have the same problem because there's just not enough service to our striker..
Work in Progress Manager,then be happy with Europa football and 5th place.
Could be time to try something drastic rather than keep playing players who are off form. New players cant do worse. Give them opportunity.                            De Gea              AWB Bailly Maguire Shaw         De Beek  Fred  Pogba  Telles                            Bruno                           Cavani
ole being a work in progress is the biggest myth. Ive not seen much improvement. Alli see is us having better players. Hes not a good enough coach
I'd put pulistry in because he's had more football than diallo with under 23s.
All a load of bull 💩
Why stop at Ramos...why not sign Suarez and Busquets as well? Then you would the three worst cheats in world football in the same squad.
Bridge, the two chances Cavani had are not sitters! If you think that you don’t know shite about football!
Everton playing well? Didn’t they lose yesterday. Goldbridge oblivious.
Have we still taken the most points since last January or not? If we have maybe it's a mistake to assume Man utd will now capitulate and struggle to finish in the top four while Man City and Liverpool will go on a long run of winning consistently, given that the teams haven't really changed in a calendar year. Moneyball it: the only thing that matters are the results not how they are gained. 10 unconvincing wins are as valuable as 10 dominated games.
Just going to say it. With the form of our forwards, why not get depay for a few million?
Y always have to get someone next to Maguire? This just proof he is crap. How on earth he is the captain?  Ole is the prob
At least fred takes responsibility and tries to shoot... when RASHFORD is in the box and refuses to pull the trigger .. big up Fred for trying .. Marks chatting nonsense.. all fred could do was shoot... where was “ the players you say shoot well” even bruno put one wide from in the box and didn’t even hit the target , so whats the difference!!!
Diallo yesterday..
Another boring draw under  Ole.
Why him put pb on the right
I love this me.
Saying arteta better than ole is like saying ole out! Arteta is a crap manager and at his first job. Ole ain't gonna improve after over 10 years of managing its naive
The Spanish government cannot allow Ramos or Pique join Manchester United the last time Ramos wanted to join United he ended up renewing his contract and wages increased 🤣🤣🤣
The only thing Ramos wants is a massive contract
Why isn't anyone thinking telles on left side with luke Shaw as left back, his left foot is a wand
Kounde reminds me of a young Martin Buchan, and I can't pay a higher compliment than that
Knowing ole he will play for another  draw.
Ramos is a liability... a passion merchant who lunged into tackles recklessly and got bailed out by his recovery pace time and time again.. didn't want him 5 years ago, don't want him now.. we must go for one of Kounde or Konate.. honestly more impressed by Konate than Upamecano..
lol no he doesn't
We need players who can shoot!
Ramos must be nuts
Like Mctoninay.
I have given up on Ole Mark. And i don't expect us to win anything  under ole.
Martinelli was a forced change. It wasn't tactical
No one deserves this abused by  these criminals.
If I'm honest I didn't want Ramos 5 years ago let alone now. The only thing he would bring is a mentality.
Seriously why would anyone believe in this? He used us to get an extension a few years back. This is hogwash.
Doesn't look like we can make a deal for a CB
I think our obsession with academy players have debased out thinking of a ‘top player’. Ole clearly sees rashford as world class, which if we’re honest with ourselves, he isn’t, and we think anyone around his level is Man Utd standard. I honestly think this has dropped the standard of the whole team when compared to other world beating teams
We are doing nothing in this window...never were.
Mark the goat 🐐
Ramos wanting a new contract with Real - this happens every time his contracts up ( bla bla bla )
Ramos used  UNITED last time to get a pay rise and a new contract with Madrid we should not entertain him  .
Sam Alardice is a better coach then Ole. He's completely out of his depth. Imagine what we could achieve with a decent manager with that squad of players. Such a shame.
Diallo innnn
last nightwear should have won
I agree with you about the dirty racism there's no need for it at all but it's too easy to stay anonymous online so it's impossible to do anything about it
It's all gone wrong since igahlos left 😂😂
U can have arteta  We will get Brendan Rodgers 🎉🎉
No he doesn’t.
Rocket surgery?
We Need to get Adama Traore, to Play on the Right Wing.. And let (Rashford, Greenwood, Martial, Cavani) all fight for the other two positions up top. IF we get Adama Traore.. he will know his role and be ok with it.. Go down the line and get a proper cross over.
Ramos is looking a new deal. 💯
We playing like CRAP.. and VVD still cannot get on the Pitch !!!!... This makes NO Sense !!!!!
Ramos is just using United to get longer contract with Madrid. United should publicly state that they not interested. To many players that just use the United to get better contracts. When in truth there is no interest.
IF RAMOS Truly wants a United Transfer.. we can Sign him for a Deal Like what we have Given Cavani
Oles a great man manger the players love him dvb come to mind
The same Sergio Ramos who said he hated Cristiano Ronaldo before going on to win 4 Champions leagues with him? It's not news he's looking for a retirement plan at Real Madrid because they fall apart at the back without him and it's incredibly hard even at his age to replace one the best defenders of his generation. Also he's said he wants to continue in the Spanish national team and leaving the country would hurt his chances.
Chong went to Brugges due to very little playing time in Werder Mark, just check the amount of games he's started and the amount of minutes he gets off the bench.
People need to man up and stop complaining about online abuse. It’s insults from a bunch of nobodies. Deal with it and move on
Artetas only a better manager since he was city's Assistant coach  which means Hes a better coach hes been at the city club for 2-3 years so he knows the tactics
Hear we go again in a fight to get top four I still question where are we going with ole?
Ole must forget his favorite and use Ahmed dallo and dony Ole is not a taction
Need a Cdm and RW before we think about getting a CB
Telles and Van De Beak were signings that didn't improve the first eleven. I truly can't say the manager has been backed.
Love you mark but social media accounts shouldn’t be linked up like that it’s weird
Sign Ramos on deadline day now and we win the league. He will give the team better winning mentality.
cavani should've left it for martial because he was in a better position to finish the chance. we complain about him not being in the box enough and when he makes the runs, we complain that he should stay on the wing. pick a struggle
Man City 1st  Man Utd 2nd Liverpool 3rd  Leicester 4th
But you might get him at the end of the season
Last transfer window it was “Sancho wants United move”... Now it’s “Ramos wants United move” 🤦‍♀️
I don't think you will get ramos this season I sapport man city
Idc what anyone says, apart from his age. Ramos would be a good signing, why? Leadership, experience at the highest level, a winner. He is everything we lack in this squad. If we have Bruno, Pogba & Ramos together we would look at a serious position for a Title race.
Martial and rashford are basically average strikers. I wouldnt compare them to giggs or beckham. They know nothing about tracking back or crossing the ball. They basically aren't good enough to be strikers for man utd (more everton/spurs level) and they are shoehorned into the wing position. Good but neither of them are good enough!
ole out
Tbh if arteta was man u manager he would be saked by now bc i don't think he could handle the big egos in man utd's dressing room.
Ole is the most consistent ...make subs after 80mins
He better leave real Madrid... I'm fed up seeing him in white 😂😂
Need to give Mctominay abit more respect. United looked pure awful when he went off. Simple as that mark
You want people to be punished then drop the VPN sponsorship that helps hide these trolls.
Inverted wingers work in FIFA, not real life, no service to box
And As united fans we dont want him....  too slow... we have a slow deadwood maguire.
Cant see it happening.  Ramos has used this tactic multiple times before to get better contract at Real. Hes good at using the dark arts off the pitch as well as on it😛
Another wasted transfer window, are the board award there was one?
Behave yourself goldbridge, Arsenal fans aren’t celebrating a draw
Thats a comment i have to disagree Fred had all right to take that shot yesterday and that’s probably the only wrong thing he did in a attacking sense, otherwise from that he almost score that was jus a worldie save from Leno he was also instrumental in that play that Got Cavani a tap een to score which he missed, Martial played the ball into Fred on the edge of the box and Fred does the wonderful flick over the top the give it back to martial who passes to luke shaw who then fires it into cavani and cavani misses lets be honest if that was bruno mark would be harping on about that flick and im not hating bruno because he is my favorite player but in an attacking sense fred was good yesterday.
Because Ole knows that a defeat or defeats will cost him his job, the way United play, is not to get beat. That is not the United way, so is Ole the right man for the job....loyal since 1980 MUFC
Ole is doing something good with the recruitment he has made so far and the club just hv to get him few first team players he needs and we off to go, He's not always the problem it's the players too
Deal with it this club was never going to buy any new players end of
United should get Kounde please
What I'm worried about is if we collapse after a long good run like the season before. It's a total roller coaster forms
Glazer/Woodward want benefit or trophy?!! If Glazer want benefit, trophy's Manu is hooeless!!
You talk about Ole’s poor ‘in game management’ as if it’s a minor issue...at this level and at Manchester United it’s unacceptable. It should be a prerequisite for any Utd manager.
the belgian league aint as good as the german , but atleast they play attacking football here man...
I would take Ramos for his leadership and mentality
No, no he doesn't 😂 PSG want him ffs, of course he isn't interested in going to Man Utd hahahahahaha.
@5:15 Damn it, Mark! How many times are you going to make me spill my coffee🤣
Once fooled, shame on you (Ramos). Twice fooled, shame on us (United). Ramos: “Get lost!”
5:10 - 5:20 😂😂😂😂😂
time to give dvb run of gamea
Ramos looking for a contract renewal again then.
Please no Ramos saga plz
Yeah he “wanted us” a few years ago too.
wud prefer lad at sevilla kounde over Ramos allot younger athletic etc
Ramos looking for a big payday at 35 or just linking himself with United to get another better deal of Real Madrid. The deal is a poor option. Rashford has been playing poorly for a while with the odd moment you remember. That back injury maybe still a problem and hes nlt tracking back like he used to either. That could be tactical but its not great as the lb.
Unless Konate has a release clause, I don't see Leipzig selling both
Put it this way Ramos would be better than the human fridge we have as our captain.
Kunde is our only hope of getting a defender we need because I don't think RBL will sell Upamecano and Konate next window with all the other defenders with the attributes we need going elsewhere
Fake
Does anyone believe ramos actually wants to come to united?
It has to be Man U fans that are the ones that are making these nasty racial comments because surely if they weren’t Man U fans they wouldn’t care about it or they would even laugh right so it would only make it if it was Man U fans
Lol doubt it
Sergio wants United move, shocked...
Take fucking baseball bats to the players. That will get them playing. Worst performance I seen in a long long time. Shite
When we got Pogba in Mctominay's position we didn't get him enough on the ball and even Ole said this in his post match interview
One way to stop all the racism and cyber bullying would be if its possible is instead of banning accounts surely there is a way for Instagram, Facebook and etc... is ban through the IP address or something like anyone that is using that households internet shpuld get banned that will slow it down more if its possible to do so
Arteta  have players he want, Ole needs players he want to become successful manager in manutd ..club needs to listen Ole atleast two consecutive transfer windows..we are not Chelsea to fix the squad issue in one transfer window..manutd board back the manager in his first transfer window..in next they won't buy players the manager want, automatically the problem fall in managers head  in second season of manutd manager..
I don't want Ramos one bit. Why not sign a younger CB that will be here for years on sustainable wages? Ramos is a month away from being 35
dont need another maguire. both are liabilities
We're not going to get anyone now so what does it matter
16:30 rocket surgery must be hard ngl
I think most of this abuse is born from gambling addiction, people getting low because they lose their 💸
STOP RACISM
I dont think varane is a good option because he always struggles without ramos.😓😓
All these bullshit transfer shows lol,  the a day off Goldbridge.
I really dont want Ramos. Overrated scumbag diver. He is almost 35 🥴
If you're gonna play Fred that high up, why not just play Donny...or move Pogba back and play Donny off the right and raahford back to the left...
Isnt United Stand sponsored by an app that hides your IP aka contributing to anonymity or am I wrong ? 🧐
Mark your wrong mctominay coming off wasn’t good for us! Putting pogba in the middle made us worse, watch pogba he’s ineffective with out the ball and doesn’t put the work in...... that’s my opinion👀
2:48 - 3:00 100% 👌🏾
A lot of blame going to Ole, got no tactics etc. I think it’s just as simple as the players shit themselves when the pressure ramps up.
This host criticizes racists but reads out comments where people say they hate the board
I don’t want Ramos, he’s used us in the past just to get wage increases at Madrid
Another wasted window due to board incompetence.
Not this again. He's going to start dropping off now at he's age not worth it.
I will take ramos all day compared to our defenders
Ingame tactics better by Arteta He's a better manager than Ole I think
The simplest way to make your mind about players for starting XI for me is to think if they will ever be a starter in a title winning side. McFred? Never Maguire-Lindelof? Never in a million years. Martial at no. 9? Looking very doubtful (He is my fav player btw. But I can't deny what's obvious)  Ole's favouritism for players like Lindelof, Mctominay is gonna cost us. And the fact that he is always so scared in big games.
Ramos wants too come
Rasford never united level of player.
Another player coming to the end of his career wants one more big pay check at man utd after using us for a new contract years ago no thanks.
I think instead of just focusing on transfers, ole needs to work on the players chemistry and decision making on the pitch, has anyone else noticed Bruno and Cavani were running way more than Rashford last night?  We have a decent enough team to compete for the title and potentially nick it but we’re lacking the hunger and energy.
Hope they don't sign him.  He turned his back on them loads of times.  United are not a retirement home and a last huge pay check for any player who are not good enough real Madrid.  Need to show the world who we are but first the glazer's need to go
Ole is not a trophy winner
How anyone could attack that wonderful lad is beyond me. Racism is vile.
Rocket science or brain surgery mark.
U can say he's a work in progress about any manager solskaer has been managing for 12 years why would he evolve now
Thanks for the content Mark shoutout to all watching from South Africa... Cape Town.
So you know more about tactics than ole and his 4 coaches?
Yes, even the Sheff.Utd. boss had Solskjaer in his pocket.. They new United would be basking in the press reviews of Sundays win over Liverpool.  They new the united players would be strolling around waiting for each other to do something..  Maguire always says we must learn the lessons but they never do.  There is little leadership on the pitch or off it, and Rashford and Martial should be rested whch might get their focus back...  Solskjaer has no plan B when things unravel and he is tactically naive .
Mark U know what i love ur honesty Bout Arteta
No superchats activated  for people from Kenya i dont know if its a général  case for people from Africa. Please address
Rashford and martial aren't playing like wingers. They need to be creative, they need to help the full backs and they need to play with energy. Ole needs to coach this but for now we should get VDB on in a diamond.
Straight in on Ole already?
Did right Mark. The more fuss is made of it, a certain person is attracted by that. A bit like mass shooters who love the negative attention. Marcus' response was very admirable, showing that these clowns can't touch him.
Mark talking about Rocket surgery again 🤔
We need use the sub properly !
Please put Rashford back as main centre striker - God Bless
Lyle and ScottBridge
Mark and Bruno Titanic style 😂😂😂
Goodmorning Mark I'm all from the Caribbean shouting out to all my lads
We need a CDM.......
What the hell😂😂
Social media platforms need to step up over racism and cyber bullying in general. They should get rid of anonymous accounts. Most these people could never open their mouths in real life.
