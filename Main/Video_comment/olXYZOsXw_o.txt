Oh my goodness I see king kong
MJ = THE GOAT
Cool movie. I’ve seen the JChaseFilms version first, but if he can pull off something like this, then maybe I can too. I just need to plan it out first.
This movie is still peak to this day
I DON'T CARE what everyone else says I really enjoyed this movie.
This wasnt even that bad of a movie
The goon squad
And what about 3?😊
When ever they make space jam 3 they can’t star the looney tunes they have to start other shows and celebrate Carlos and George’s 20th Birthday Instead of Playing Basketball and It Shouldn’t Only Include Warner Bros they gotta make more Groups of Studios Channel and the New host Replacing LeBron James Sammy
But every world is Warner Bros
Best movie I have saw this movie Space Jam 2 A New Legacy with my mom at ShowPlace ICON Theatre & Kitchen in Chicago, Illinois in 2021 with the NBA Basketball Legend LeBron James. ⛹🏾‍♂️🏀😁😃
LeBron doing what he does best, Acting!!
Honestly don’t care what critics are people say about this movie! I honestly really really like this film! The movie actually saved my movie experience in the movie theaters letting me know I should now watch movies in theaters to have those good experiences!
This one is better than the first movie
Ive watched the trailer over and over but never saw the movie anyone else doing that?
It shouldve been bronny james instead of dom
I Don't Know Why People are Quick to Hate It. It Looks Okay to Me.
P3d0 Jams 2😂🎉
Someone should this trailer but the Owl House version
Could we get something with Space Jame but instead it’s Football
Everyone Joins The Space Jam!
Do movies man you would be great.
Space Jam 3? I only want it if they fix Lola Bunny & get her back to how it was in the first one!!   They made huge errors & hers was the worst. I don't just mean the appearance (which also needs to return or it wouldn't match up).. But, her personality & voice. They absolutely destroyed her.
best movie of 2021 i really love this movie, its amazing.
How come, LBJ forgot to flop?
Come on, Heroes.
THE GREAT MOVIE EVER!!!!
I don't know if I'm tripping but I swear I remember in the trailer LeBron hugs the wife
I like these cartoons🎉🎉
I immediately knew when he said “son of a glitch”they were trying to sneak in a bit of an adult joke. Clever
Whether with suc,y (just IMHO) LeBron James and legend Michael Jordan, my advice is to advoid this if you're a WB cartoon full length theatrical fan, and instead see #TheDayTheEarthBlewUp instead.
JAM SPACE 3 MOVIE 2026!!!!
Now why would they let Bron Mess up this classic  🤦🏾‍♂️  They Messed up my child hood Memories 🤦🏿 Even the Soundtrack is Horrible  “ Fly like an Eagle”  Was the best theme song ever  I’m sick 😢 Leave it alone Bron

I think everyone enjoyed the Looney tunes and the cartoons. But I think everyone likes the cartoons and the jam
It might seem funny to people but for me i like Michael Jordan the best... He was more of a classic and timeless beauty... But the new one hits different looks like..

We all know Rooster Teeth is owned by Warner Bros., but it would have been cool if there was a deleted scene where Lebron James meets team RWBY in the RWBYVRSE.

Man, Lebron James really diddied us now.
Is for Kids
there only one space jam and there is only one MJ
Yo I watch this like that movie
That was the worst movie ever!  Reasons: 1. It features LeBron James instead of Michael Jordan. 2. It got any multiverse of any Warner Bros. projects like Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, etc., which was a bad multiverse in my opinion. 3. It got unfinished animation. And 4. The cast is different from the first movie.

Formerly I was interested this 2nd sequel from the past but Now I'm no longer interested this remake movie ever I prefer the original sequel of Space Jam.

Total disrespect to the original. James is not Jordan. Period. I guess I could of been worst could of been Coby Bryant.
Here ℹ️ Butch... have one#thousand#sizhundreds#Buck$♡❤
This movie trash 🗑 this was a waste of movie and time idk why he did a space jam 2 movie but it trash just Disrespected to Goat and Legends who made a classic Space Jam and Looney Tunes had more than 10 minutes in the original classic film.  The LeBron space jam so trash they sell it at dollar general 😂.  It kind of suspicious Kobe Bryant R.I.P had to pass away before LeBron started tearing down Lakers Franchise and disrespectful Real Legends
Why is this movie not released yet?
2:36
i like it
King lebron james
Le clown could never
The movie wasn't that bad, I'll rate it a 7 out of a 10. Everytime the camera was on Lebron, I felt like I was looking at a Lebron commercial, but he's still my 2nd favorite basketball player of all-time.  If MJ would've really made an appearance at the end of the movie and helped Lebron, it would've instantly been a 10/10 for me, of course Disney had to humorously add Michael B Jordan as a cameo after hyping the audience up for the a nostalgic epic appearance of MJ, I can only imagine what the Looney's reaction would've been, " what if" lol? Disney never fails.....  That was the only flaw in the movie for me.  If this would've came out in 2003, it would've been a smash with more creativity. MJ appearance should've happened but I'm sure they offered him a cameo and he declined "respectfully", I can't stop thinking about the "what if" 😭🤣.
Imagine space jam with the Looney Tunes, Messi and Ronaldo
Where is Pepé Le Pew ??

A travesty of a movie. Should never have been made! Original had charisma, great music and humor. This is a stressful generic superhero movie. NOT to be called Space Jam

Years after watching this movie on HBO Max during the height of the pandemic, I must say that even though the movie ain’t perfect, but in my humble opinion it’s not the worst movie I’ve ever seen. I’ve seen waaaay worse films out of WB, Disney, Sony Pictures Animation, Universal Pictures and Paramount Pictures, this was honestly a fun sequel that is willing to be self aware of how corporate they are while making fun of it and especially making fun of the aspects of Space Jam by showing us how dumb and half baked the concept really was (remember, it was conceived after a couple of Air Jordan commercials with Bugs Bunny).  And the filmmakers, writers and animators were definitely trying their hardest with this movie and it definitely shows on screen. The utilization of CGI and traditional animation was beautiful to witness because I honestly missed seeing traditional animation in a big budget movie, great job to everyone involved in the animation department and that they finally got credited after that who fiasco that WB did (look it up).  But I’ll be honest and say that Looney Tunes: Back In Action is the superior Looney Tunes movie, it’s directed by a genuine fan of the Tunes and was close friends with Chuck Jones before his death in the 2000s, I never get tired of of that one personally.
Hey Warner Bros. I am a huge fan of your work, I just want to say thank you for the Looney Tunes and making that Franchise possible, and I got an idea: Space Jam 3: The Big Leagues, with the Tune Squad in the real world with LeBron James and they’re competing in the NBA, I would really like that. Please make that possible
King? You're no king, narcissist
You are my sunshine❤ my only sunshine❤ you make me happy😊
😲😲😲😲😲
This is the dumbest movie I've ever heard of. Ever. What an utter waste of money and time. You knew it was an epic fail the moment LeBron James was involved.@
It is interesting how THIS REFERS TO REAL LEBRON JAMES AND HIS LIFE  IT IS MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE YOU MY GOLIATH 😭🙉
Who's here after the You are my sunshine meme?
1:47
Kobe should have stared in this. It would have been perfect. He retired already and they needed help saving earth. What would have been great is if the Toons went to Jordan first than he said how he is too old but he knoes the perfect guy for the job. Than they go track down Kobe.  He could even make a joke about how it be the Redeem team type situation.  WB drop the ball on this one. Also sadly Kobe pass before the movie came out but just saying it would have been better with him.
Love this❤

This is not entertaining at all. You had a rough childhood and became rich and you calling it rough. Why don't you try laziness and remain worst. Your parent did their best. It's call parenting

And what was it that you said you daggum daggum you want to play LeBron James in a game game on
And I have honestly seen the big guy brick a dunk and he was with the Milwaukee Bucks he knows who he was
I just watched Space Jam with Labron James, and that guy is a total daggum daggum in the movie. And it’s the light for the little ones that I do and heaven let your light shine down. And Tom Brady is not Ryan Blaney. And Ryan Newman had Tom Brady and the Patriots defeated by himself. I play pool. And the little ones strike first. And that’s what I did was play pool and that guy is a total daggum daggum if you ask me. Just like a daggum daggum pardon my French fried tatters but someone over cooked them

While the OG Space Jam will always be superior, I still enjoyed this movie too and don't believe it deserved the hate that it got.  (I also hope to see a Space Jam 3 one day.)
Can't understand anyone who wants to watch a movie with Lebum ..
What is war machine doing here?
LeBron wants to be like Mike soooooo bad
After see his shoes in pawn  stars
When they said, what the glitch, i immediately knew they were trying to sneak in a bit of an aldut joke. Clever
This movie is awesome I like it and saw it when it came out
Because of hated lebron is, this movie won't receive its flowers until the nezt 5 years or so when he's already retire. Then people will try to cling onto whatever memory they have of him.
Woke attempt at a movie. This is the product when I woke government is in charge
Not gonna lie. We missed a chance to see Gandalf on the court😢
I liked this movie.
I immediately knew when he said “son of a glitch” that they were trying to sneak in a bit of an adult joke. Clever
I love this movie
Unpopular opinion: This movie is more of a WB 100th Anniversary special/celebration than that "special" with the Titan Twerps as hosts/main characters.  At least most WB owned properties are in there & the Looney Tunes are front in center.
Absolutely butchered a classic here
Oka shuni qayrdan topsam buladi
No where near as good as the original. And le bron is no where near as good as Michael Jordan.
Wow, No Diversity here is there, not a white person in sight
stick to basketball
Can make new space jam new movie
They don't have this trailer for DVD/Blu-Ray opening.
I thought I wouldn't enjoy it but surprisingly I loved it ❤
When I first watched this in theaters. I was lost for words. I didn’t know what to think of it. But the more I watch it, the more I grow on it and it appeals to me. It did still give me that vibe that the whole basketball game in this film gave me the same old vibe the original Space Jam did  just with a modern twist to it. I think LeBron did a great job with this role. I mean you have to admit. Michael Jordan’s acting in the first one is pretty bland, but LeBron kinda gives the same vibe in this film as Michael did in the original Space Jam. I mean the whole second half of the basketball ball game when they all go looney to make a comeback reminded me EXACTLY of the second half in the original. Plus Porky Pigs rap in the second half of the game had me bursting with laughter. Plus that scene was SO 90’s. Overall, I appreciate this film. I enjoyed it. Of course it’s not as good as the original. But that’s what you have to expect with sequels.
They had ONE chance to make this right... and they screwed it. People already forgot this even happened. Meanwhile the original Jordan movie despite all it's faults remains immortalised.

SPOILER ALERT ***** Lebron recruits the original MonStars from the first movie because he couldn’t beat them!!!! lol
Love the original movie so much it's one of my favourite childhood movies.I watched the new Space Jam 2  movie and i regret that i watched it because the movie is so terrible and trash.
The acting was bad, especially Lebron’s…it’s so corny and sounds like it’s forced or not natural. Very bad
2 years went by so fast 🥲

I can't remember the last trailer i saw that made me want to avoid a movie as much as this .
2:10 The sheer confidence that Lola has for LeBron is insane!
Did you notice in this movie, the scene with the Tasmanian Devil, they put Rick and Morty in this movie. I was like" WTF"?! SERIOUSLY, WHY THEY PUT RICK AND MORTY IN THAT MOVIE?!!!

looks fun ty
Not a bad movie but will never top the original one
Kobe would have been a much better choice for this.  Much better for sure.
0:31 0:32 1:46
The first one starring MJ in '96 was amazing but I love this one with LJ more. I also love Don Cheadle as the villain. Imagine if Steph Curry was also in this movie as a member of the Goon Squad? That would have been more fire ❤
the movie's story is kinda messy, but i kinda enjoyed it ngl. maybe it's just because i'm a huge lebron fan and i always wanted to see this, but this movie was pretty fun to watch ngl

I would have like this movie better if we had Michael Jordon again as some kind of reunion and legacy story instead of using a different basketball player all together.

Time to watch this again, after LeBron just broke Kareem’s record! All-Time NBA scoring leader!!!
i liked this movie seen it when it came out
The cgi is top notch on this Movie 💪
Im a 90's kid and Space Jam is a great part of our childhood memories glad WarnerBros made a sequel to this great movie 💪 Shoutout to all 90's Kids out there we are getting older 😂✌️
This movie was made for kids, and if you're a kid you'd definitely enjoy it. Only reason it gets so much hate is cus adults watch this lol.
Yeah it still won't be better than actual space jam !!   There's quite a few Iconic character voices missing !! Very noticeable especially Daffy Duck !! An i hope they leave some references to the guy the made it all happen. M.J (not the singer!! The player )
This movie was awesome and my unpopular opinion to people to this hate this movie then i respect your opinion
horrible movie

I’m a 29 year old adult, and I’m obsessed with this movie lol 😂 I just wish more of my peers who grew up with Space Jam enjoyed it as much as I did. I do not know a soul who liked this movie. They either hate it or refuse to watch it because it’s not Michael Jordan
Loved Space Jam A New Legacy 🙌LeBron James stole the show, loved the vibe of the movie, gave me nostalgia from the MJ 1996 one, real feel good movie 👏👏👏👏
my 5 year old lasted 30 mins before asking if we could watch the real one with Michael Jordan. Probably my fault for showing him the real thing first
👎👎👎👎👎🤦

Here I thought Space Jam 2 is an actual sequel by making the movie into actual fiction in this terrible movie...
It's sad they didn't put Michael Jordan in the movie.
ooo jessus
If your not a Lebron James fan after this something is wrong
Um, ok...I'm pretty sure she (assuming) heard me. It's on I guess.

It’s funny when lebron says I’m a cartoon and then bugs says what’s up doc 😂😂😂😂
This movie sucked. If you're thinking about it, don't waste your time.
Me watching it:😀😀 Me when i see steven yeun or glenn from the walking dead:wthhh😯😯😯😳
Why do people say LeBron acted so bad. I don't agree.
This movie wasn't made for the children right now it was made for future generations to watch & enjoy so no one opinion right now matter in anyway form nor fashion.

crybaby james is a joke compared to MJ.
The original one was better
This is a cool Multiversus trailer
The original Space Jam was better but LeBron is trying to be like Mike 💯🤷🏻‍♂
Imagine being anticipated to watch this, and then you realize the critical and commercial failure it experienced. Cuz that’s me

why did this trailer have qcd and the movie didnt though
If this movie was made in modern meme culture it would be praised like morbius and minions were
It would be more great if they didn't have this clown on it

Saw it with my older sister  A lot more entertaining than the original  Glad they updated the graphics bringing the Looney Tunes into the real world  I was laughing at a lot of the jokes from the winking nods and inside references going back to the first movie  Thankfully the core message is about being true to yourself and focusing on your goals  Lebron James is kinda flat in his delivery and they bombard the audience with so many brand advertisements  But it was still fun and Don Cheadle makes for fun villain  The basketball game portion is the most fun  This was worth the 25 year wait 😄
Well, this movie sucked.
idc what anyone says i actually enjoyed this movie a lot lmao
i'll be watching this soon
Wack
Bruh wtf is that?? Visually looks great. Kid looks borderline brain dead. Dad looks like hes trying too hard to be an actor. The bad guys over expressive face made me want to curl up inside. 1:41 And whats with the blue arm band they all got?  As cool as it all looks, I feels soul less.  Yook.
This film did a better job than Ready Player One
the trailer is better than the movie lol
I wanted to see pennywise play basketball
Damn that bunny girl  💖 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yes 😍😍😍😍
Welcome To.... YEEEEEABA DABA DOO!  The Space Jam
absolute garbage
Where’s dom
Mel Blanc called he says you're not funny
Ethan Liming murdered at his school and not a word from Mr. social justice warrior 💩
Ahhhh that wade reference was so dope holy shoot
Yes, this film certainly has a new legacy... For being a soulless mass commercial and overall awful movie...
If you don't see this at AMC Theaters, You're in the Wrong Universe
What am i looking at???
space jam 1 is so better,this is ........ U no i mean.....
A year later and there is big chance lebron is coming to a little game called: Multiversus  Will we see his reveal soon?   Well only one way to find out june 9th at summer games fest from what i hear  Edit Lebron James came out for MultiVersus July 26th
They should have had Steph Curry do this instead.
I watched the movie and it was okay 👍
LeBron James was playing so good in the movie they made him an actual NBA player
Remember when there used to be original movies
Don Cheadle was so good in this
Settling down with this
Yeah come at the door

space jam is pretty cool i guess    Space Jam is a 1996 American live-action/animated sports comedy film directed by Joe Pytka, with animation sequences directed by Bruce W. Smith and Tony Cervone, and written by Leo Benvenuti, Steve Rudnick, Timothy Harris and Herschel Weingrod. The film stars basketball player Michael Jordan as a fictional version of himself; Wayne Knight and Theresa Randle appear in supporting roles, while Billy West, Dee Bradley Baker, Kath Soucie, and Danny DeVito headline the voice cast. The film is a fictionalized account of the timeline between Jordan's initial retirement from the NBA in 1993 and his 1995 return, during which he is enlisted by the Looney Tunes characters to aid them in a basketball match against visiting aliens who intend to enslave them as attractions for their amusement park. Space Jam was the first film to be produced by Warner Bros. Feature Animation, and was released theatrically in the United States on November 15, 1996 by Warner Bros. under its Family Entertainment banner. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who were divided over its premise of combining Jordan and his profession with the Looney Tunes characters, although the technical achievements of its intertwining of live-action and animation were praised. It was a box office success, grossing over $250 million worldwide and becoming the highest-grossing basketball film of all time as well as the tenth-highest-grossing film of 1996.In 1973, a 10-year old Michael Jordan tells his father, James, about his dreams of playing in the NBA. Twenty years later, following his father's death, Jordan announces his retirement from basketball and pursues a career in baseball. Meanwhile, in outer space, the amusement park Moron Mountain is in decline. Mr. Swackhammer, the park's proprietor, learns of the Looney Tunes from his minions, the Nerdlucks, and tasks them with abducting them as attractions. Upon their arrival beneath Earth's surface, the Nerdlucks take the Looney Tunes hostage, but Bugs Bunny persuades them into allowing them to defend themselves. Noting the Nerdlucks' small stature, the Looney Tunes challenge them to a basketball game despite their inexperience. After learning more of basketball, the Nerdlucks infiltrate various games, usurping the talents of Charles Barkley, Shawn Bradley, Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson, and Muggsy Bogues. The Nerdlucks use these talents to transform into large and muscular creatures, whom Sylvester refers to as Monstars. The easily intimidated Looney Tunes realize their need for professional help. While golfing with Bill Murray, Larry Bird, and his assistant, Stan Podolak, the Looney Tunes take Jordan into their universe. Bugs explains their situation to Jordan, who is initially reluctant to help. However, Jordan agrees after a confrontation with the Monstars, and forms the Tune Squad with the Looney Tunes; they are joined by Lola Bunny, with whom Bugs becomes enamored. Initially unprepared, Jordan sends Bugs and Daffy Duck back to his house to obtain his basketball gear. Jordan's children aid them and agree to keep the game a secret; Stan notices the pair, follows them back to their world, and joins the team. Meanwhile, the incapacity of the five NBA players results in national panic that culminates in the season's suspension. The players try to restore their skills through various methods, to no avail. The game between the Tune Squad and the Monstars eventually commences, with Swackhammer arriving to witness it. The Monstars easily dominate the first half, sinking the Tune Squad's morale. During halftime, Stan sneaks into the Monstars' locker room, learns how they obtained their talent, and informs the Tune Squad. Using a unique plan, Bugs and Jordan rally the Tune Squad, who improve in the second half with cartoon physics. During a timeout, Jordan raises the stakes with Swackhammer: if the Tune Squad wins, the Monstars must relinquish their stolen talent; if the Monstars win, Jordan will become a new Moron Mountain attraction. On Swackhammer's orders, the Monstars become increasingly aggressive, incapacitating most of the Tune Squad. With ten seconds left in the game, the Tune Squad are down by one point and one player, with only Jordan, Bugs, Lola, and Daffy still able to play. Murray unexpectedly arrives and joins the team. In the final seconds, Jordan gains the ball with Murray's help but is pulled back by the Monstars. On Bugs' advice, Jordan uses cartoon physics to extend his arm and achieve a slam dunk, winning the match with a buzzer beater. After Swackhammer scolds the Monstars, Jordan helps them realize that they only served him because they were once smaller. They encase Swackhammer inside a missile and send him to the Moon. After relinquishing their talent, the Nerdlucks join the Looney Tunes and return Jordan to Earth. Jordan later returns the talent to the incapacitated players, whose remarks convince Jordan to return to the NBA and resume his basketball career.

All that money and u couldn’t but an acting coach 🤦🏼‍♂️

Bad active Lebron.
I envy everyone who has died before the release of this film. They don't have to live with the stain movies like this have left on our culture.
I love Space Jam
Good one
Wow
this was underrated
This movie made me love basketball
IT ISN'T FAIR THAT PEPE LE PEW AND PENELOPE PUSSYCAT ARE REMOVED FROM THIS GARBAGE FILM! THEY ARE MEMORABLE CHARACTERS!
Space Jam: A New Legacy may not have the "best" WB put out, but the trailer for this looked like it was gonna be a HUGE improvement over the first. I mean just look at this trailer, it looks so phenomenal!! But ohh what could've been...
It's Wreck It Ralph 2 with a desperate attempt to sell everything that's WB. One of the worst films I have ever watched.
how to turn a classic into a boring movie well done

Space jam what is your phone number wait is this LeBron James that was in space jam because I remember that movie the child you are the best player you can go against Kobe Bryant because he wheel ankle breaker you he will go to the right and act like you want to laugh but you really gonna go to the right but he will fake it out and go to Lil so watch out for him by
please add the banana splits back!
this is sooo cringe
The space jam 1 was so good.....but it's the worst 😫 😩....didn't liked at all
My dad definitely won’t
Yikes
You know you lose when granny says I’m going old school on his but
Black Power movie no thanks I'm out!
I hate you Hollywood!!
A movie about speedsters probably
this movie is legit just an AD i was so excited for it and wow worst movie of 2021 tied with the devil made me do it 2 movies that could've been amazing but failed so hard.
Nicely said. I love Space Jam! Can't wait to go see this movie! I doubt it's even in theaters anymore I'm out to date.
THAT WAS AWESOME 🤑

Watch the orginal dont support this ccp puppet
Hi
Ahh yea the timeless BronVsMJ debate finally settled....  80S BABIES HAD 1-MJ aka TheGOAT 2-athletes who had passion  3- moron mountain  4-originality  2000 BABIES AN UP HAD -LeBron  2-Cancel culture  3-Athletes who only want money  4-A society of soft soy boy/girl/ect who let Silicone Valley mold and control their life   Space Jam ment so much to the youth at the time ,we didn't have Twitter and Facebook ect ect... we had the ability to actually have conversations an talk instead of let phones control their entire life an only text when they feel like it.... as far as the new abomination with LeBron I refuse to watch it push its liberal/progressive/woke/SJW propaganda an their PC narrative
Yoo this cool
Dislike 👎👎

Wish they would have done this with kobe 🥲
ZMM on the ASX. 99% down. Great value investing?

Greatest franchise of all-time! I just wished they used the remix of the theme in the film found in this trailer.
Wolcome tu spacejam
Spacejam Michael jardon
Loney tunnes Michael Jordan bugs bunny lola bunny
Omg !!!    🤦‍♂️🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Lebron’s acting on the court is way better than his acting in this… like did they only do 2 takes per scene for him?  He was terrible, but understandable.
Dennis Rodman movie would be lit
Why everybody hating on lebrons acting? He did great
Yakko: kit pull up wind then Jerry well go down Kit: okay Jerry: wait whoa whoa whoa What is happening whoa wow where are we now bugs bunny: eh whats up doc
My favorite part was when it was over !!!!!
Absolute Garbage of a movie !!!!  Guess WB felt the need to go Woke and broke with LeBron !!!!
*I can bet there are more adults than kids here 😅 wish they start re telecasting it*
Nice
its edit or not king kong is was in space jam
oh i realy miss my childhood

Ruined the original with a grown man who can't even control his own tantrums as the star of the show. This is disrespectful to Michael Jordan.  Go watch the original instead
Welcome King James, that's not his nickname. His nickname is - Mr Ripoff Artist.
My son just said Michael Jordan is still the goat after watching the first and then this one.... i cried cause it's facts.
where’s Michael jordon
LeBron James go on and do a slam dunk

Illumination presents Space Jam: A New Legacy (alternate reality)  List of trivia:  This is the first Illumination film of the 2020s to be produced at 1.85:1 aspect ratio. The second will be Sing 2. This is the first Illumination live-action/animated hybrid film, since Hop. This film was celebrating 25th anniversary of Space Jam.  Logo variations:  Illumination logo variant: TBD
The space jam is my fav
why is this soundtrack not in the movie?
It would be such a dream for fictional charecters to be real ..
Kako je ovo u julu ako ja idem sutra da gledam u bioskopu
I think I saw the mystery machine!
This simply weak and disappointing.   He is not Mike and Mike couldn't pull off a Space Jam II.   They should take a different approach.  This is Chrysler trying to keep up with Ford and Chevy.   He's neither!!!   Don' be a copycat, be a Tesla.
I literally just heard that Nintendo switch

Best Movie In 2021 Ngl
Ok
I like this movie 👍🐰🦆
How is it possible to make such a horrible film?
wait, is this the studio who fired Grindelwald? nah, even pirating this movie is not for watching.
Lebron makes a sequel that’s much worse than the original. Seems pretty accurate to me

10 out of 10 I enjoy this movie 😊 You don't have to agree with me if you don't like this movie.  But I'm sorry ^_^ Both space jam movies are amazing 🤩
The movie sucks but the trailer is awesome!
There’s a Nike logo when Lebron turned into a cartoon
Imagine Jordan reacting✌
the space jam theme song has been revived
I Feel Like There's More Dislikers, Haters, &amp Despisers Than Adorers, Lovers, &amp Likers On This Movie. I Just Don't Get Why. I Love Both Of These Films.
Im overdosing on goosebumps, too much nostalgia, I can't I can't 😭😭😭
AL G Rhythm isn’t just a computer genius, he’s a computer HACKER!
I quiet enjoyed it except for the fact bugs bunny seemed like he had more anxiety and less confidence compared to the 90s space jam bugs bunny smh...
What they did to Marvin the Martian in this movie was unforgivable.
REALY COOL!
Help I love Space Jam so much that I'm already exploding for this
Can't believe I wasted $7 on this.
Not bad, but I'm more for the Michael Jordan film. You can't beat original classic quality film.
Terrible movie
He should have watched Shaq's movies before committing to this.
The best thing in the trailer was instantly turned into the worst thing of the movie. Really disappointed.
Tbh the movie was really boring but nice animation
Copy of a  bollywood movie 😁😁
First one was a black guy second one is still a black guy and they cry for diversity. Right ?
Never knew the war machine was here

Eu vi 1x esse filme, e não vejo mais, o antigo sim vejo e tenho gravado ainda em vhs, nostalgia pura, um filme de hj de filho conta o pai, porra Warner nada ave isso.
They should've made a Kobe one in 2006-2008 and Lebron should've done the third Space Jam. This movie looks terrible. A lot of popcorn appearances but bad writing/plot.
I love soooo much
Space Jam: We Took a Dump On The Legacy. We tried so hard to make Lebron's 2 championships look good but, everyone knows it doesn't compare to Jordan's 6. 😆
Superb Film😍

imma be honest the movie was good but it could’ve been better with the plot cuz it was mainly just about lebron and his son. like the trailers made it look like the nba superstars were gonna have a role in this but they were all together in a one minute scene and barely did anything on screen. it would’ve been way better if the filmed involved everyone instead of just lebron the most. the missing thing was MJ but it’s whatever it was still decent nothing to hate
There’s A New Space Jam Movie With Logos
I spotted yellow among us in here
Is there yall ready for this in it?
Lebron James is unironically the ONLY good thing about this pile of steaming dung... If ANY one of you still has anything to say please bare in mind they even changed Yosemite Sam's gun model to what could probably be the worse cartoon rendition of a gun.  Oh and we have a human villain... And CGI Looney Tunes which should land someone his dedicated infernal circle...
this wasn't only a bad space jam movie this was one of the worst movies i've ever seen. I'm talking this is up there with "The Room"
Is Space Jam: A New Legacy going to be put on the VHS (as recordable) or is it going to be put on DVD (fullscreen 4:3)?
#svemirskibasketnovonasleđe
I love that moive!

If you are born before 2k I doubt you’ll like this movie at least 3 out of 10.

Space jam one feels better to me. Like it wasn’t as complicated as this one yk.

I love it I watch it today
In looking for an acting spot but just don't know where or how to start because I have no connections
You’re not the biggest subscriber OK
Regular people: LeBron must be the mc cos he's the current best player in the NBA  Bron haters: LeBron must be the mc cos he's the best actor in the NBA
Vaaaaw
Oooooop
To me this movie is boring
This movie is so bad that it should've been thrown to jam in space where no one will have to suffer this atrocity
A movie that never needed a Sequel. The music, the era... timeless. you cant copy that or make it even better.
i like it when al g rhythm sent lebron in the serververse
Pepe Le Pew, It's not in the movie  😕 👎🏻
I still can’t believe no ones giving more attention that the voice actor of Lamar from gta 5 was the cop in space jam 2 lmao
Michael Jordan and LeBron James had to win the Game to go home. Michael got his friends talent back to go home and LeBron got his son back to get home safely and take his son to Basketball Camp. I might put myself in Space Jam mind would be called Space Jam of X and mind might be for me to go back to a Hotel.
Pete send this  guy down to the rejects
This movie just feels like a basketball themed Ready Player One movie

LITE Movie
this is super hit movie
1:46 pennywise
1:41 was that Drogon grom GOT?
King James👑🏀🔥
Let's get this movie on the front pages of the most disliked movie in history
I don't know why is everyone complaining about this movie, it was cool. I know all the mistakes the movie did, like the disappointing goon squad or the soundtrack. But it was cool for me, it is just a non-sense basketball looney tunes movie.
epic!
Dribble these cheeks buggz
just imagine that it could've been Kobe instead of LeBron😪
I just see that on my tv when i watch cartoon network😭-
WHAT A HORRIBLE PIECE OF SHET.
seeing how much the animation has changed since the og space jam is just- wow
Space jam: space jam Disney.                       Bugs bunny: buzz lightyear.                              Daddy duck: woody
1:58 :O
1:40 ITS THE IRON GIANT!!!!!! :D
In 2023, I want to see a Disney movie styled like Space Jam: A New Legacy, but use Baseball instead of Basketball, and have a Disney-themed serververse.
This fool killed the movie! Michael Jordan will always be number 1!!
Can I make a short of this plzzzzzz
Lebron highlights better than the movie
Don't waste your money. This is almost certainly the worst movie I have taken my kids to see in years. A complete joke, to be honest.
Fgghjj high my
ALL THE POINTERS IN THE MOVIETOON IS THE OPPOSITE OF LJ. 1. LOVES DOING PRACTICE AND DONT COMPLAIN TO HAVE IT 2. TAKE OWNERSHIP TO BE THE GO TO THAN A PASS THE BALL TAKE CREDIT STILL 3. PLAYING DEFENSE.  BUT WE SHOULD CREDIT WHAT IS TRUTHFUL ABOUT LJ 1. TEAM JUMPER 2. INSIST MORE ON TEAMMATES THAN HIMSELF 3. DEMANDS STACK TEAM
Thumbs Up If you Think Like Me  If *Kobe* was alive, It would be *Him* at this film.  *R:I.P*  *África - Angola - Luanda*
I wish Kobe could have played this role 😔
LEBRONJAHAMZ
I appreciate the remake and even paid to go watch it but damn, this movie is horrible lol. The acting is horrible, I know Lebron is not an actor but I couldn’t tell if he didn’t wanna be there or if he’s just that bad an actor. There really wasn’t any funny parts and man Hollywood will you please stop pushing your agenda on the public through movies.
2:33 Woah!
Warner bros: we cant add Pepe Lew pew in space jam! Also warner bros: adds the friken droogs!
…. Nope they f*** everything ….
This movie sucked! Original space jam wayyyy better !
Inpruducing the toon squad

So,  You've watched Space Jam: A New Legacy and you're rewatching the trailers.
Haha classic 🤍
0:28 I just wanna positively thank lebron cause he actually got me saying that on tiktok lol
Transhumanist agenda in full force. No thanks. 👎💀
/execute in overworld run tp @s 0 ~ 0   and thats all what you need to do
Good basketball 🏀
Wow king kong is in de space jam cool👍
Someone said it in the comments already but this movie was basically just Ready Player One basketball edition. The entire premise of both films was "Here's a bunch of references to things you might like".
something tells me that this is a kind of response to Disney+ :v
Orginal was 100 times better and actually meant what SPACE JAM was and is.,,,  and itd not a video game.. this was all BS waist of time and money,,
1:40 Is that where Drogon went? ( from Game of Thrones )
1:40 Is that Drogon from Game of Thrones?
This Is nice music
Who else’s fav character is the grandma with the walker 🤣
I love the movie space jan  legacy
damn RL GRIME!!!!!!!!!!
the trailer is already bad .. imagine how the movie will be ;-)
balls
I LOVE YOY GUYS
2:14 that scene would've been funnier if they didn't include it in the trailer
I don't like this. I want you to make a tune squad full movie. No trailer.
"Cmon and slam" that sounds wrong lol
Ye
Lots of people liked the movie and lots of people also disliked it but in my opinion it's just a so so movie just like the original space jam probably just barely average and a lot of people are bashing Lebron's acting well what do you expect Lebron is a pro basketball player not a pro actor in the original space jam they made MJ act calm and collected so they can hide his bad acting I'll give some props to Lebron's acting cause atleast he tried
I just finish watching this movie and I'm full of goosebumps ❤️❤️❤️(goosebumps in everywhere my teeth, eyes and kidney)😆
wow its soooo good :D ACTAULLY NAH DIS TRASH
Please suggest me that song ...when Dom's upgraded ...
only 1992-1997 generation would enjoy it at most
Honestly I just watched this movie and I've gotta say I loved it. it was so much fun and payed homage to the original Space Jam in parts while remaining current for the new generation.  Lebron is no worse of an actor than MJ was and did really well. I didn't think they could pull off a Space Jam sequel but they did and it rocks!  Awesome movie!
un vero schifo il peggior film della WB si capisce perfettamente che l'azienda sta fallendo perche è i peggior film mai visto una vera schifezza fatto male recitato da cani con un lebrawn bloccato come un pezzo di legno, e non sa ne recitare e nemmeno dove guardare nel film una vera merda, ho ben capito che la warner bros è sull'orlo di un fallimento
Anyone notice the Angel wheel 🤓🤔😱0:35-0:37
I ain't see no big Chungus :(:(
Good qualities: It's nutty, 2D animation is back, and the 1st replacement for Mel Blanc as Bugs Bunny is back.
I came across so many reviews of this movie, most people seemed to dislike the movie because it had LeBron James, but it's like everyone is forgetting he isn't the only character, a lot of other people played just as important roles  or contributed to the making of this movie and I feel it's ignorant and one side minded to completely discredit an entire 2hr movie simply because you aren't a fan of the main character. Everyone seems to be a pro or critic on everything until the roles are reversed...
Huh???????????????????????
I would love to see Lola bunny’s name changed to Daisy bunny. Make Daisy look like Bugs but with the same fur as Lola.
1:18 don’t tell me ur teaming with that 😂😂😂
Just here for the Looney Toons mob...
Oh à cartoon yaaaaa😉😉😉😉😉

What a disgraceful movie ! Lebum James is a joke ! Hollywood are the enemy! Oh yeah , it's all black characters!
This trailer is amazing seriously
1:38
My favorite part when all the characters the Warner Brother characters come to Space Jam
Eh,What’s Up Doc? “Classic Line.”
Kong slam! Lmao
get woke, go broke. good luck making money with lebron in your stupid lil movie.
keep deleting my comment, i have no life, and can copy/paste all night long.

1:38 SPACE JAM
2:15 YIKES
1:33 🤣🤣🤣🤣
IT'S NOT SPACE JAM!!!!!! >:(
I think we can all agree that every kid that grew up watching Looney Tunes are either teens or grown ups now. Please bring back the Looney Tunes show. 🥺 We love the adult theme that the show has and i’m pretty sure most of us are willing to pay to watch it. Please consider bringing it back. 🙏🏻
Please bring back “Looney Tunes show” Please bring back “Looney Tunes show” Please bring back “Looney Tunes show” Please bring back “Looney Tunes show” Please bring back “Looney Tunes show” Please bring back “Looney Tunes show” Please bring back “Looney Tunes show” Please bring back “Looney Tunes show” 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺

I hate this movie it is so bad hard to watch
Wrestlers are much better actors basketball players are terrible actors..
No one likes lebron come on and to have this idiot defeat batman I'm pretty sure you hate all of yor fans fom the last 100 years that ideas is straight up bad!!!
granny
Atp. PARA TODO PUBLICO
VAYEN A VER SPACE JAM.  PELÍCULA RECOMENDADO
Am i the only one pumped up
I just saw the movie and despite what the critics rate it this was a very good family movie.I’ve seen booth space Jam  movies and they are both great animation and had different story lines. Lebrons was  more family oriented with a message about family pains  but family unity and understanding  in the end. Skip Bayliss must really dislike Lebron  to  pan this  really good movie on his sports show.
Who's still watching the trailer after the movie?
This looks like fever dream
Wowwww 27% rotten tomatoes what a failure of a film. Lol
this is not a Lord of the Rings style epic movie.  you don't need to hit the drums and base so hard on every note of the sound track.
Father was for jokes
ISIS jest zasłona dla sztuki
Gardzę wami wszystkimi i życzę najgorszej śmierci jaka jest możliwa
Should I go to the fast and furious 9 movie or space jam?  Edit: nvm just going to fast and furious 9 with family  New edit: the cinema doesn't show the fast and furious 9 movie anymore, they let my family down. They gave me up, they let me down, I run around, they desert me
So, I just read that Lebron James said that this series "flopped" because of racism...  NO, HONEY IT FLOPPED BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT MICHAEL JORDAN.   I was excited, until I heard it was you. I mean, damn Shaq would have been my first choice. Definitely NOT Lebron James. Smh. It has nothing to do with racism. If that were a truth then the first Space Jam wouldn't have been a success, as it was. The problem wasn't race Mr. James, the "reason" was you.
Hmmmmmm
I watched this movie once on HBO Max, and I can tell you for sure that the movie didn't have as much originality or imagination in its animation and storytelling as the first one did.
Should have put the 150 million that it cost to make this mess towards lowering CO2 emissions
This looked horrible! Don't even think I'll try sitting through this one. The first one is the ONLY Space Jam that I will recognize
BUG BUNNY IS BACK BABY!!
I'm a huge Bugs Bunny fan, but james? Communist POS? not so much.
My friend: endgame was the biggest crossover  Me, an intellectual: yeah, your right
JUST BOUGHT TICKETS TO THE CINAMA IM GOING TO WATCH IT TMR AHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
im scared
what is game of boners planet doing there?
Was seriously hoping this version of the Space Jam song would've been in the movie. Really disappointed.
This worked the first time because Looney Toons were massive.  I'm not sure how it will do this time.
1:52 Goon Squad
🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
Some people don't watch the movie and just immediately give out their opinion as "Ugh", "It's awful", "It's trash", "Pathetic", or "Stupid" like bro watch the movie before judging. It's like they say... never judge a book by it's cover.
That was the Dumbest Movie Everrrr!!!! It was dumb for adults to follow so how are small Kid’s supposed to stay tuned! Don’t pay or go see that Mess! Lebron I Loveee you but that was whack! Just Horrible!
what's up dawg
he actually said it
Kobe would have been a better lead actor for this project. Too bad he never got the chance to do it. Of course, Kobe would have done something original.
Haven’t seen the movie yet but it’s trash discrace of the original stick to basket ball lebron
Lebron en la ciudad looney bugs bunny le da la bienvenida
They need to make a thumbelina live action please!

o look LeBron James trying be like Michael  Jordon    with his space jam 2      isn't that cute      everybodys wants to be    but not everybody can be   there can only be one    and his name in michael jordon      just like usain bolt   the first and the last  case closed
I saw it at the cinemas and it was awesome
WOW! I CAN'Tunderstand .i love it
I loved the movie but the one thing I couldn’t stand is the amount times the fact that LeBron has to get Dom back is explicitly stated. “Get my son back” “Get your son back” “Get our son back” And so forth.
0:54
I think the plot couldn't be better for a remake, bringing the AI stuff, LeBron's and cartoons different approaches to the game and the pressure on his son. But the execution fails extremely. Horrible.
Watched this yesterday it was awesome 😎
I call it "The new ghostbusters effect".
Lets make a bet thqt the next one is about steph curry
This doesn't even make sense because it's not space. It's Internet Jam, this is more like ready player one or a sad kids version of the matrix.
So because they have the models from Ready Player One, they just re-use them in this movie to fill it up more.
0:54 When your parents sit you at the kids table even though you’re a young adult
The trailers are much better than the actual movie we got
It’s the guy from Fortnite omg
These movie is insane!i watched it!
I got to be honest, the Harry Potter theme gave me goosebumps!
It was so cringe I couldn’t finish it… 😬
Well shit...I liked it. I loved it actually. LeBron acting sucked but he’s not an actor. The movie as a whole was enjoyable.
Warner brothers: kong in space jam me: y godzilla Warner brothers: godzilla has dead me:wohooooooo me:bye bye monsterverse legendary:the monsterverse continue legendary:yes me:no
Aaahhhhh!!!!! *blows his finger* I'm a cartoon?!
Space 🚀 jam
Welcome to the space jam
Is it just me or LJ doesn’t seem like a good actor?
This vibe on this one is really awsome! cool effects and colors.
So now LeBron made the space jam movie dam it. I’ll tell you one thing LeBron will never get to do is learned the moonwalk from the master Michael Jackson like Michael Jordan . Take that lebron!
Bom
This movie was a 8/10 for me, it used amazing effects.

I wonder how his wife and children felt knowing that Lebron would rather make this terrible movie with a fake family than spend his free time with his actual family.... "Priorities"
I’ve never seen the first one. How does it compare?
Lacrolândia
Trailer looks great. I am waiting for the movie release 🤩👍
Ohhh..🤤
OH WOW
Looks like dogshit
Not at all as good as the original....2 hours of a waste of time.
Rlly want this to come out in DVD
i like space jam
0:05 “ball”
0:01 This is the best trailer ever I have watched it so many times this is one of my fav movies
Loony tunes with a real loony 🤔!
Just watched this movie and it was amazing
The old one was better
I got the lebron toy from mcdo sheesh 🥶
The looney tunes already knew how to flop amazing
Kong and the iron gion and super man!!!
Wow Lola bunny walk or jump and blink her eyes
Massive eye roll @_@
UTTER RUBBISH
Space jam FORVER
I like the movie.  The message was on point.
first micheal jordan gets his own brand and now lebron gets his own movie, lol
I actually enjoyed the movie. It wasn't the best, but keep in mind, the first was no masterpiece. I'm 20 and have watched both. Y'all just blinded by nostalgia
I got a tumor from seeing this movie, I belive I have cancer too. Beware of LeBron James acting, it would be like 😐.
WARNER BROS characters  1 All 4 LEGO Movies  2 SMALL FOOT  3 Scooby-Doo  4 HAPPY FEET  5 TOM AND JERRY  6 All of the CARTOON NETWORK characters  7 The mask [Jim Carey] 8 Pennywise  9 DC Superheroes  10 The Wizars Of Oz  11 Among US Imposter  12 The Flinstones  13 The Animaniacs  14 The Jetsons  15 Space Ghost and Dino Boy
Smells like Ready Player One
Finally I waited for like two years I keep saying when space jam 2 I really want to see it finally it’s here jeez
disney is the best in cartoon movie
Worst movie ever👎👎👎
Terrible movie... truly horrid
Warner Bros. sure got it right, Lebron is an egotistical supremacist that acts LOONEY TUNES.
People are way to negative... This movie was fine, if you go to a space jam movie thinking it will be as a master piece as titanic was, you are going with the wrong mindset. This is a family friendly movie and it succeded at it.
As someone who mostly cares about the sotry,I actually enjoyed this movie,sure,wasn't as good as the og,but I found the enjoyment in it,I ignore the "CrInGe" and "CaSh GrAb" stuff and actually focus on the story of a movie,and it was,like I said,enjoyable
I just went to the theaters and THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME 👌🍿🍿🍿🍿🏀🏀🏀🛰🛰🎟🎟🌟🌟
Why is lebron just an immensely better actor than MJ. The difference is night and day. Love the new movie
Earnings from movies like this should be donate back to kids in need and not for actors to get more and more money....
For alll the negative comments below I disagree. Went to the cinema with my 4 year old son and enjoyed every minute of it. Can't believe I was his age watching the original ❤️ nostalgia. Love both films now
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa somebody help me! Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh oush
playing nba by electronic arts on ps1 right now. anybody know if and where there is a free stream of the new movie??
im going to watch this at the cinema with my mum and my BFF can't wait!!!
After reading a considerable amount of hate comments here.. All I can say is         ...if u got a problem with the movie then go ahead and make it better , don't watch it and not  diss on it cuz it lacks so many things from YOUR HIGH EXPECTATIONS.
1:00 Lebron: SOMEBODY HELP ME!
what in the Margies duh
Terrible movie 🤢🤮
1:18 the only ones you need are Kong and Godzilla, dude.
1:57
If Kobe Bryant(the Legend) is still alive. .I think he can fit the role very well. 😔
Watched this yesterday, I give it an 8/10 pretty good. I dont have high standards tho lol
What is this on
gad damn
Cringe jam
Lebron is critical race theory clown
You cant beat the classics.
These new films are what I have been dreaming of for the past 15 years. What if my favourite movie's crossed over. I know some people complain about it but come on, have you really never thought about what if scenarios involving your favourite characters like, what if superman and the hulk teamed up and fought Godzilla. That what all these new movies feel like to me, really ambitious but the internet thing is starting to feel  a bit old but hey, at least it's not an Isekai.
WTF did I just Star in, Watch and Hate?!
The trailer gives me chills but the movie will probably give me ills.
Just watch this on HBO max it was good I don’t know what these haters are talking about  had a lot of funny parts also, put some respect on king James
Good funny movie, bad spots but definitely worth a watch
Space jam 5 (2028)
Space jam 4  Micahel b Jordan  naruto
His nothing MJ shadow. 😂😂😂
to be honest...this movie is awesome in our generation...hoping for a sequel
This just seems like an attempt at cashing in on nostalgia. Albeit, a really poor one.
if the splits were in the background and they were dancing
Space jam: new legacy Fanscription: A)protaganist (aka sports playing celebrity) should be potrayed as a  Rich guy who loves to spend time with his family and also as a modren day Santa type of guy (aka a person who loves to give gifts to poor and needy)   B) protaganist's second son (aka the second protaganist) has to be potrayed as a game developer who develops games with so much lore and story but for the first the first time in the movie  He develops a simple game with his name with no lore and story because he want to honour the sport his father plays    C)Algi Rythm should lure protaganist and his second son for the sake of becoming popular but the reason protaganist and his second son show up at WB because they want to turn one of protaganist's son's game as a movie  Franchise but Algi Rythm hates that idea and then also  Algi Rythm's idea To put the protagonist in every single popular movie is also  Rejected so Algi Rythm becomes so angry   D) Algi Rythm kidnaps protagonist and his first son and also second son  And challenges them if they want to save protagonist's first son   protaganist's second son has to win a video game against Algi Rythm  That video game should be one of the video game made by protaganist's second son and beat him(aka Algi Rythm) then only  they can leave serververse E) protaganist and his second son go to matrix world recruit players that can help them in the game  and they come across granny (looney toon) protaganist fail to find players in the matrix world  And go to mad Max world there they came across other looney toon characters protaganist and his  second son feel confused and then they go to looney toon world there they meet bugs bunny learn that toons left toon world because they want to experience the thrill of crossovers so they left the  Toon world bugs bunny want gather the whole looney toons gang and bring them back to toon world protaganist feeling the need to help bugs  Gives bugs a idea to use the excuse of this Algi Rythm's challenge game to bring all of the toons back together  If they see through this how much fan following for each and individual toon has looney toons will realise and comeback to toon world Bugs and protaganist recruit all of the toons and play and win the game  Leave serververse and Algi Rythm even though failed the game but he successfully became popular    The end
I keep watching this
Where was the space in this Space Jam? Do I miss it? Should have been virtual jam? Digi Jam?
cant wait
WBpyr
There is a movie in your advertisement.thats the whole movie
0:57 “tune world”. Shouldn’t it be “toon”? As in.. cartoon. 🤦🏻‍♀️
Bad movie

Yuck LeBron 🤮 why not Michael Jordan again or atleast will Smith or Martin Lawrence wtf
Why ain't rhodey wearin' his suit
Loooooking like a double wide suprise.....god damnnnnnnn
I watched it also no tom and jerry :(
Once again Lebron, can’t come up with anything original by himself. He keeps chasing a man he will never catch. Even if Lebron does hold records he is a generic brand in basketball. Can’t even come up with his own number in basketball. Get your own number Lebron and quit being as a child would say a “copy cat”! There is and always will be only one real 23 that  made the number what it is and his initials are M.J.
welcome to the Space Jam
War Machine being the King of Server-verse? Is this the Multiverse?  P.S. Ohh sorry, wrong universe.
King James really, He needs the title of a king?  Need to have a huge picture of himself in everywall in his mansion huh! for the king lol
1:58 When you actually did your homework but you left it at home
Welp, wish me luck guys. Ima go watch this movie…
#SavePapaMeat
another mess made by WB…c’mon find someone who can make a good movie with your characters.
How did you ruin such a simple concept????  It's not even 3D anymore.
This bunny's hopping down the old rabbit trail!
Looking like a double wide surprise (inhales) GOD DAMN!
1:34 to 2:13 HYPE OVERLOAD!
GOOD 🙂
I loved this movie. I don't care what anyone says
Space jam looks a lot different knowing Warner Bros legally claimed meatcanyon's video making it canon Bugs Bunny is a struggling r@p!st
Can we get the song from this by itself please?
Not even 1 second of gameplay, waste of time.
Who's Reading the comments to see the Mad people? XD
I enjoyed this movie, but it flopped!
Now make one with Giannis Antetokounmpo!
Where is majkel jordan
Big chungus
Trailer looks better than the actual movie, trust me.
I've watched it in cinemas in 17 July 2021 in UK
Ironman is live
So bad.
The amangus
all this does is prove MJ is the GOAT. Original movie, he helps the tune squad win. Space Jam a New Legacy, LeBron needs the tunes help
I SAW THE MYSTERY MACHINE FORM SCOOBY DOO
*DON CHEADLE*
Honestly the only actor in this movie was Don Cheadle all the others sucks at acting absolutely no emotion whatsoever
Lebron sucks... I would rather see Jordan as an old man in a Space Jam 2.
Enjoyed watching Warner Brothers Jam: A Company Legacy!!

Eh,what's up,doc?
Genuinely one of the worst movies ive ever seen
this movie is for kids so stop hating on it
This looks trash
This is so stupid, I love it.
just watch ,, wow this is one bad movei ( 1 of 5 stars)
Is this Lebron Jahamez
I wish kobe is still alive 😭 he's more suited in this movie than lebron.
its every weebs dream
Welcome to the Cash Grab. Heres your chance, puppets dance, for the cash grab.
I understand that we should desexualize Lola bunny, but the breast reduction was really unnecessary, and just as sexist. They should’ve just given her a personality and make other characters interact with her like a normal person (instead of going crazy when she walks in) and that’s enough (the clothing change was good tho)
This movie sucked! I'm so sorry The Looney Tunes shine but everything else sucks
oh boy this is going to be the biggest lost of money in the galaxy
Guys have you seen the game of thrones Easter egg
Sell out. Sell out the country, people and your own community.
Pro-tip: Fire yourselves and hire someone with Actual Creativity!  Or just keep pumping out sequels nobody asked for and wondering why your industry is tanking.
Just saw the movie and I loved the vfx and the animation hopefully there can be a space jam 3
The cool part + cringe 0:31
This tastes like cancer.
Pathetic. Original Space Jam is epic, this is cheap, bottom shelf cr@p.
Why lebron's son Bryce is in the movie like hes the main caracter but not Bronny james jr is bronny still grounded for smokin w33d? or did he fail the drug test? #FreeBronny
The whole time I thought they were going to remix the space jam song and I was very sad after it came out
Marvin the Martian should’ve been a player.
Just now finish watch and damnn this movie is fireeee❤💥
Omg--look how oppressed LeBron is!!!
!Spoiler Warning!          I like how dom is a villian
I only liked the iron giant in this.
I LOVE IT!!!!!!! ASE ASE and ASE
Best movie of 2021 tops
That was good it's equally to the first 1
Omg
I liked the trailer and i want to see the movie Space Jam 2
si guillo space jam a new legacy 👦 ⛹️‍♂️ 🏀 👑 🐇 🇵🇷 🇺🇸 2021 🙂 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
1:17 Batman Logo on the left Omg
Trash
Can I get me and my kids $6.25 back for viewing this 90 minute commercial
There was only 1 space jam. And he is no Michael Jordan
I am for sure watching this with my sister we both play basketball and woah taht trailer 🏀
Cool
Good movie 3.5/5 haters gonna hate..
I bet Michael Jordan is watching
0:58
This movie is kinda garbage when I watched it.
WHEN IS THIS COMING!!!  😭😭😭
LeBron ruined this one but we all know this
Trailer better than the actual movie
like it
I just finished watching it and it it’s amazing it’s fun entertaining and ur whole family can watch it I loved looking around finding all these Easter eggs and all of these amazing Wonder bros characters I feel it would be cool a movie going threw all the worlds shown
Trash.
Really, you could not find anyone better than Lebron?
Queen James is the worst! 👸🏾
What is wrong with lolla?she looks not like her. Dislike
This movie help us to know that MJ is the real GOAT
I’m about to watch it rn
no way there are 30yo dudes arguing about a kids movie lmfao im ded😭😭😭
Footbol jam lionel messi plisss 😂😂😂 bugs bunny and Messi movie.
i will NEVER watch this movie!! lol
Should have stated this a while ago but does anyone else get a feeling when they look at the 3D version of Lola bunny, she is like a cousin of the really bad first interpretation of sonic in sonic: the movie with the small eyes
just finished the movie and i think the movie is really good
It's a 2 hour advertising for Warner, besides, a ton of Matrix references wich is totally missing the target audience, the movie is from the 90's, 5/10 years old have no idea what that movie is.
Would have been better as a Rick and Morty Cartoon!
Space jam was great
New genre: black and rainbow film.
Good movie love it
I hope I'm not the only one who notice the switch ... is just a phone with Switch controlllers
This is nikki anderson
I watched this movie it was straight garbage the best thing about the movie was Bugs Bunny. LeBron cant act even when playing himself the Jordan movie was way better.
If Kobe was still alive, they should’ve used him and gigi in this movie, and made a space jam 3 with lebron and a whole other
Whenever your drive and the really close but was kind of like it’s time and then the daughter decided she wanted to come down here to town Center and she’s right with a loft apartment and she want to be like walking distance I think so she rents her condo to Brendan Sally yeah went down there the other night we went to wild wing ring wild wings buffalo wild wings walking around down there and park in your car not having to do anything she was Joey does so many hours of caregiving because she’s like I said hey I understand some Thursdays when I get in the car I’m ready to stop somewhere now Janets getting so repeat repeat it will eat in 20 minutes later so glad we have lunch no no no new new new new new did you do do you did you how long do you stay on it L arginine and it was actually actually it’s actually it’s a vibe it’s like focus energy focus hey mommy mommy gonna tell you remember when daddy says knock it off in enough is enough I don’t like that you know no I don’t like mom I like I don’t like daddy saying knock it off and enough is enough and June so should I be worried about tape just have it done before mommy where are you knock it off June get working on my fireplace and get it done and get these tools out my knock it off June enough is enough June I just text Becky to see what’s going on la blah blah blah blah blah blah listen to your mother sorry I was just going to raise my name no
This is so stupid
Today i'm gonna go watch space jam o-o
the algorithm is it
Sucks at max....
⚠️HEY DON'T IGNORE THIS⚠️God loves you, turn to him today and Repent Your Sins And Believe That God Died For Your Sins.God Bless🙏🙏
I came here after I saw the 4.3 rating of the movie on IMDB expecting a lot of dislikes for the trailer but apparently not. I didn't watch it yet but my question for those who've watched it, why it got such a bad rating?
Lebron haters coming here to hate lol
No thanks
I just saw the movie and I had mixed feelings, well the animation part in the movie is 8/10 and the reality is 2/10. Really bad acting, dumb story line and reality part felt bland. So I ignored the reality part, and god damn I enjoyed the movie thanks to the animation... Wubalubadubdub🍻
Don't waste your money. Kids hated it and we walked out half way through the movie . Terrible acting and plot
so poor film
These comments are just "LeBron is bad, this movie is bad, and nobody wanted another one" and "This looks pretty good and cheesy" with nothing in between
Where big choungus😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌
I LOOK WESTEROS
Nice film
Lebron the type of person to pretend to get hit and roll on the floor crying like a little girl…. “King” lmfao….
Lebron go move to china bro so u can bend the knee in person u not top 5 and u movie gonna lose 200 milly
Tell me why Glenn and Sasha from The walking Dead are in this
Watched the movie with my family. Love the moral! Super cute movie.
omg there is pennywise
Why did Lebron forget Godzilla he's powerful
The 90s called they want Space Jam back.
why is everyone hating on this lol just saw the movie and i thought it was great
space jam for you 😜😜😜
Love ❤️
Penny wise is there
Can I have the link
Who liked the old one more
I liked the old one
Today I saw the movie in the saniema it is so cool go what it out
1:43 is king kong
That is dope
Man, People are tripping about this movie. It was fun and entertaining and mainly meant for families! Since when is that not enough??
I really thought people would love this as much as my family did. Nobody said lebron was an actor and who said he was in anyway trying to be like mj. Hints why tge plot is changed up a little. Some kids of this generation havent even seen the 1st one. The effects were bomb and they took so long making this so why hate like its a decent movie for critics, and in my opinion🔥 its a family movie if you dont like it go watch the original then
Should have found a less controversial player.  Lebron is trash
Doing Anything to be  in the Michael Jordan conversation. LEBRON James hasn't figured it out yet that MJ is a ghost and cant be chased.👍💯😄🤣
This feels as if it's trying to mess up MJ. THE G.O.A.Ts space jam movie.
Why remake a great movie
The scale of the quality drop is equal in both the cases below: Lola bunny to Lola Bunny 2 MJ to Lebron
Lebron is represented by the ccp, so as long as his handlers are ok with it,  he's good.
idk ab y’all but i actually thought the movie was pretty good..
Gandalf bruh king Kong bruh but superman BRUH
Cmon give this guy a break. Still comparing LJ with MJ even in a movie. Who do you want to play the character,? Paul Gasol?
This looks beyond retarded!
Yo Thats all the movies and kong is there
“Dribble these cheeks, let’s see how smelly those finger tips can get”
Theres scooby do van there 1:39
This movie sucks
Lebron CCP puppet James
2:23 they literally both touched it with the foot. Can’t help but feel like that’s against the rules
we have M.Jordan and NOW we have a new star LeBron
When you want to defund police but 90% of parents defund  your movie.  🤦🏾‍♀️
It should be computer jam lol
lol, flop.
haha SERVER VERSE GOON SQUAD HAHAHAHAHAH
The Space Jam song in the background gave me nostalgic chills...as any unnecessary movie sequel that came out like, twenty years after the original trailer does. I just wish it was actually in the movie. Then I would have had MORE nostalgia.
Junk!!!!
i love this moves
HyyvyyyyyVic  Yugoslav  =yyyyhyyyy but gyy vgv by vugy y hyyyy6=yyyyyy6. Yyyyyyyh vhv g
1:40 - 2:08 This gives me chills to the max and i dont know why
I cannot unsee 2 hours of this film now. what a dumpster fire
Y would they ruin the legacy that was space jam they're not even in space they're in a computer.
WB MISSED THE BOAT
Lookin' like a double-wide surprise. God damn! This little rabbit's hoppin' down the ol' bunny trail.
The best movie i ever seen to sleep boring boring boring
i guess in a few years, we'll have a documentary called The Last Dance: A New Legacy and a new crying meme with Lebron's face....
Big shout out to my friend cro JAM. may you never be broken again =3
Quite a solid and fun movie, totally different from the first movie so the two movies are impossible to compare, LeBron was good he acted well...
I can really see this winning an Emmy.
bambi
space jam more like waste of space on hbo max jam
teeheeeheeeheee
space jam more like grape jam
The most ambitious crossover ever
still can't act
Ugh... LeBron's acting looks horrid. Then again, it would be in keeping with tradition with the original Space Jam and Michael's performance.
#NotMyJam
0:31 Best part
WB I like this movie
Pump up the jam let me see your body moving put your hands in the air and pump it.
OMG I'M SO EXCITED 😁😁😁😁
Iron giant just watch the basketball it's pretty chilling
How much longer will the world be forced to participate in Lebron James's delusion that he is the new Michael Jordan.
Song 0:32?
My daughter is 4 and she feels this is dumb. Again,  She is 4.
Space Jam: Micheal Jordan  Space Jam: A New Legacy: Lebron James
Nostalgia bait. Gonna hit all the same beats as the last movie but now with as many obnoxious Warner Brothers references as they can stuff into it.
music is lit
Lol they have to play basketball, LeBron gonna loose like he loss to the suns😭
So it seems all of the movies and cartoons from the past years all came together into space jam
This movie was basically an advertisement for WB products. Movie made no sense. If lebron lost in the movie would he have said it was because of racism?
1:00 LeBron was sky diving into the Tune World.
I saw pennywise at the field 😂
Love this movie
This is only a trailer but I feel it this is gonna be LIT 🔥
It was trash.
How embarrassing.
Is this as good as the space jam 1?
This was such a good movie! 10/10 would watch again
I watch this movie another time and this trailer is still popular
Get woke, GO BROKE. Warner Bros. losing $100+ million from this garbage movie. LOL
Just watched it, I liked it Just don't compare to the original and it's really good (The original sets the bar too high)
Mweep Mweep!
Me realizing in the start of the movie that one of the kids is Dillon from all American
bug bunny
I wanted to like this I just couldn't.
Looks dumb
woah
Um
References: the movie
Sonequa Martin-Green is in this? K, can't watch it. Pass.
Movie was so trash. Can I have half my money back please , I know I can’t get my brain cells back but Lebron is the worst actor I’ve ever watched
I love This movie 🤩
This movie was so bad that I knocked out
I feel bad lol everyone is being negative. I thought the trailer was ok... I understood the jokes. The tech theme you guys they’re trying! Kids are different now... we used to play outside a lot and watch tv lol we actually watched loony tunes like do your kids even watch them? No? Exactly so how they gonna like this film??
Ok it looks cool but when we getting  a beetle juice 2 tho 🤔😕😫
Wtf is this sh#t, the first one was a bummer, why would they make another one?
Send this movie right to the 🗑
Me and my family are gonna watch it now
even bugs bunny kneels before the event?
Gross… thanks Hollywood
Roger rabbit 2 Warmer Brothers Version
I can't see da thickness bruh
Extremely disappointing
LeBron can already get the Oscar by flopping.
I've officially added Space Jam 2 to my list of movies to NEVER watch. The first one to me is vastly superior on all levels.
we know warner, you have as many franchises as disney, but if wrecking ralph 2 was a failure for being a movie that tried to be a one-hour commercial with everything disney has licensed, why did you think it would work for you ? based on the fact that corporations continue to try to attract children with tactics from more than 20 years ago (yes, I am talking about the rap scene, cringe as f..), in an era of fortnite, roblox, streaming and youtubers..
This movie sucked so bad.
Kobe should’ve gotten a Space Jam movie. Not Lebron
The first Space Jam movie is actually better than this one by far
"Dribble these cheeks, Bugs"
0:31 🥶
I petition for a animaniacs cameeo!
I fell asleep three times during this movie. I have no idea what it’s about. But it’s terrible it’s absolutely terrible.
Lebron james deserve an oscar Award
This movie is actually more for kids than basketball fans.
Can you put Stephen Curry please.. For Space jam 3 🏀⛹️‍♂️
This film was the epitome of 'style over substance'. Terrible acting. Stunning visual FX.
Trash movie
I’m gonna be honest the movie wasn’t that bad Lebrons acting was interesting but you can’t say the game animation intro was 🔥🔥 look at the edit I made u see
Jordan wanna-be… Maybe one day he will come up with something original…
Everyone in this comment section ain’t never seen this movie before everyone hating for some reason I swear everyone on this comment section is dumb fr I showed my sister and she agreed💀💀
I just watched it at the movies this was so cool!!
I saw this movie over the weekend   I I HAD FUN WITH IT!
no lol
Why is Big Chungus become small chungus
James' son HATES basketball? WOW!
I just saw the iron giant 😍
Watching the old Space Jam cant bring myself to watch this new one when all I keep thinking is that it should have been Kobe
Best movie ever
Bugs Bunny says “Yo what’s up my Duck & Doctor Who”.
It was cool. Not bad. Not the greatest. I’m not gonna hate.
The original Space Jam still holds up great today. This doesn't look good whatsoever. Hate the generic lazy cgi these days used for animation.
Who's here after watching the full movie  👇
Acting is not for you, Lebron. Sorry. I only watched like the first part and his acting skills is just NOOOOO
Sorry your excellency... But nobody cares about this movie..
I will still watch memes
As I watched the movie, this scene didn’t appear 1:12
Trash😂😂😂
They really got LeBron saying “the computer? He’s black?” In the movie already makes me uninterested never heard that shenanigans in the last movie
*The sad truth is that they misspelled TOON.*
Say what you want about this movie it’s still better than the first Space Jam
Had a great time, took my three children, wife, in laws, rented a private theatre viewing at AMC and enjoyed the show
🔥🔥🔥🔥😎
HORRIBLE MOVIE SO CRINGY LIKE NO FIRST INE MUCH BETTER
They shoulda made the movie with Boban Marjanovic instead of Lebron.
Space jam: MJ lovable Space jam 2: LJ angry
GO GET MICHAEL JORDAN AND PUT HIM IN THIS MOVIE I AM VERY MAD AT YOU WARNER BROS
Not even CLOSE to the orginal.
i hated the original space jam...i hate this one as well

It sucks
the shitiest movie i have ever seen , thank you for ruining a childhood classic
Big Chungus: The Movie
I bet if it was anyone else then yall would be calling space jam the movie of the year, but because it's LeBron James it's totally different smh. So what if it's not the greatest movie ever and Bron isn't the greatest actor and so what if he can't compare to MJ, at least he made something of himself, and i bet my life that most of yall will never get to where he is in life. Stop putting him with Jordan and just let LeBron be great 💯
I love looney tunes 🙌
Did not care for the reviews. I watched this twice and still enjoyed the heck out of it
I think be in the basketball scene with LeBron James I saw Danny The Street from DC Comics.
1:46 Is That PENNYWISE 😓
I aleardy watched the movie on hbo max
Just saw this today
Not gonna be the same as the old one
This film is basically the equivalent of Warner Bros throwing a Comic Con with a basketball game randomly in the middle.
Cringe 🤒
[live in a palace, worth hundreds of million}  "I ARE OPPRESSED!"
Looking like a double wide surprise
SPACE JAM 3
I Love ita movie
LITERALLY....Lebron comes off as an insecure high school teenager looking for attention and to be the coolest kid in school after the kids that were cooler then him graduated the year before 😂😂😂 so fake....even critics say Michael Jordan was great being His natural self in his space jam unlike LeBron who seems so fake in his movie. Such a wannabe Michael Jordan....Pathetiic
Well. It's not like basketball stars are known for their intelligence or ability to speak. And this clown....well he's just pushing communist bs
Goon Squad > Monstars
1:07 Ahh
Haters will still be haters. Lol
As soon as the Game of thrones rings came up I knew it was gana filled with pop culture references. Comments called out the ready player one
👑 Honestly It was Enjoyable!!😂😄🙏💪
Ok, I don't know anything about Lona bunny and other characters in this movie. Saying that, I still don't understand the controversy over Lona Bunny. After reading some article all I have got is that people are  angry over Lona's appearance. And it is still so  f**king confusing because we complain when movies over sexualize female characters and in this case people are angry because this movie remedy a problematic concept that a woman is beautiful only when she has big breast and hip. People are so hypocritical.
stupid af
1:12...this make me feeling well😍
What is Rhodes doing there?   Hahahaha
It would've been better if Phil Lord and Chris Miller directed
Plot twist, Lebron leaves LooneyToones and joines the other team
Oh cool july is my birthday
worst move ever ! 96 spacejam whas a blast!!! cant even compare the 2 so baaaad
Is it worth it to watch this movie in the cinema? Or is it actually as bad as yall are saying? Im watching it tonight at 18.00 and I'm curious
I drop this :{ 👑👑👑
Lebron James can never be M.J and never be better then the original space jam..
MJ Before  Now LJ
MJ 23 still the GOAT
so a cartoon version of ready player one
this movie was so bad. just delete it and go watch the first one. youre welcome
way angay lebron ..maypa si curry actor pa kaayug dating
A sequel is always bad...
I have watch this... I don't care people say about this movie.. but I really enjoy this movie, so much fun, great cgi, famous characters, good story and epic.
0:59 Jumanji
Sorry but not sorry guys😐 was nothing like my original 96' Space Jam.
Does LJ fall and cry everytime they tap his hand?
It’s is great
Why is it ok for a dab be seen on a kids show?You know the dab is a drug gesture ?when you put on arm out like you are passing a bong while coughing.
23million views
Lebron dropped 1000+ points on 5 shots and Jordan only dropped 44 on 22. There are levels to this, this is why LeBron’s the goat🐐
Damn he wanna be will smith so bad, he even brought him up 😳😳🤭🤦🏻‍♂️
Besides reminiscing on the first, the only two good things about this movie was seeing the Mon Stars in the stands and the picture of Kobe, which they should have made this when he was alive. May be Rest In Peace
Looking like a double wide surprise
"It is officially canon that Bugs was a struggling rapist all along"
Thank God I have no children so I will not have to see this.
1:42 was that a rathalos!?
Such a nice trailer for a garbage movie
its lebrons first movie, why so much hate bruh jeez
I want to see that movie
Ready Player One but there's an orange ball in it
THAT WAS AWESOME 👍
Well tbh, the first space jam was ridiculous too, and this movie does look pretty cool to watch.
Space Jam: A New Legacy is MORE PROOF Lebron James will ALWAYS play second fiddle to MJ.  GIVE IT UP LEBRON... YOU'RE JORDAN'S B*TCH!
oh wow, many characters from many universe combine into one, FANTASTIC
What a disappointment of a movie. Lazy acting and mediocre writing, Space Jam became Space Jackass
LeBron is already a millionaire, but think about how much money they paid him to be an "actor" in this movie and still he failed completely
🤣🤣🤣BOY DID THIS GET GREAT REVIEWS
Good film but I preferred the original ok special effects was amazing but I didn't like it when toons went augmented but apart from that I give it 9 out 10 😊👍
Gonna see it TOMORROW
Looks like garbage. I miss Mike.
If u plan on watching thua dont this movie is the worst in 100,000 ways if u still do tho watch it on hbo max where it is free
Pure trash garbage😁 my dream team is better than his dream team🐩🐈🐒🐖🐄🦆🐿🐛🐁🐢🐧🐇👈
This is wack...even the music...Seal did justice to the original Space JAm
Yooo I Watch this movie and when Saw bugs fading away with a smile at the end it made me cry😢
Monstars > goon squad Jordan > Lebron  And this movie is buns, boring, horrible, and just a mess
This movie is not diverse enough.
Lebron chokes again.
The first one better yo
SPOILER: They steal LeBron's ability to flop and cry foul. He has to play against real defense and needs to get his flop mojo back.
Best animation in the movie was how they filled in LeBitch James's bald spots.
Hi WB. Just want to let you know that "Basketball" movies are never ever any good.  White Men Can't Jump is not a Basketball movie. It's a movie about a white guy hustler who is always messing up and loses his girl at the end.  Love and Basketball is not a Basketball movie. It's a love story about two people taking different paths and then ending up with each other. It's a movie about a girl overcoming stereotypes.  So please don't make Space Jam 3😶😶😶 Any Space jam scripts in the file cabinets.... BURN IT. $150 million budget.... REALLY???? And Lebron is not MJ. MJ has the larger than life aura.   Make a MOVIE, not a BASKETBALL movie.
The best part is when Micheal Jordan makes an cameo
This movies plot had me dying laughing cause of how bad it was
please dubbing in hindi language
I dont know why this movie has low rating from critics and non critic people alike although 70+ from google average review is decent i think it deserve more than that. Im not a lebron fan i honestly would have preferred kobe if he was still alive (may he rest in peace) but lebron is not that bad its probably because of lebron haters this movie got a bad review. I really liked the first one and this, theres alot of funny and nostalgic moments as a kid who grew up with Looney toons. Id give this 9/10 dont jump the hate train this movie is a must watch honestly.
Don cheadle had way too much screen time
The very very VERY little kids in your family will enjoy the colors.... And the animation was pretty.  Wish I could say more... Actually, I will. My family wants the $72.50 we spent out for a night at the movies, back. BTW I will settle for a $20 McDonalds gift card and a free large pepsi mailed to my home.
Looks dumb af
Says we've got Michael Jordan, and Michael B Jordan walks in. Ha
Did you just call the opposing team Goons? That's THEIR word.
iron giant :)
I already watch this movie, this is a cool movie omg
If only Kobe Bryant was still here.
I just seen it. Some of you is not gonna like it but me was, LMMAOL!!!
Word on the street is that your movie... kinda sucks?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Was really looking forward to this, just turns out to be one giant commercial, completely soulless compared to the first.
You’re here wondering if this sucks. Yes, it sucks.
Even LJ was hopping to see MJ to save his game.
iT's ThE gUy FrOm FoRtNiTe
I kinda like the old monsters better
Space jam
KING OF  THE BOX OFFICE💜
i saw pennywise in the back 1:46
This movie is really good y’all. Next level animation. Lebron killed it. Loved the father-son storyline. Don Cheadle was great too as the villain. Highly recommend you take your kids to watch this movie. You won’t regret it 😎
Exactly like player 1....the director had no creativity of his own. & can you even call that basketball? They didn’t have any rules so no skills were needed so why do you need the best basketball player? It defeated the whole point and they weren’t in space they were in cyber space smh
Not my Lola
LeBron James is a CCP sellout.
Wow I watched 20 min and turned it off. It was soooo bad and cheezy. How could they mess this movie up? Lebron is a bad actor.
Can I download the game
Not the goat just like this is not space jame
Kobe Bryant should’ve been the main in this this was 👎🗑
Why the flip it is always in 3D, i miss the 2D one
Moron mountain
Haha so glad to see communist woke james and this movie flop soooooooo hard.
Watched Critikal's review on this... Nah, I'm good. The original was the best
Cool movie
Double Wide Surprise!
Don't spend money on it... It's a terrible movie
Fun fact:   This movie is actually a subtle hint to the movie Space Jam featuring Michal Jordan      Edit: OMG GUYS I JUST FOUND OUT THAT THIS MOVIE ALSO HAS ANOTHER EASTER EGG AND IT CAMEOS THE LOONEY TUNES?!??!!
did you know there is a hidden 666?? his outfit for the fame in the back is a 6 then on his left short another 6 then the 16 take the 1 out.. 666
I couldn't even get past 30 minutes,  wasn't feeling it. 👎👎
Movie is horrible. Save your money
This movie was sooooo good
The original space jam is the first movie I have the earliest memories of and my parents played it for me almost every day, so this new movie coming out was very nostalgic for me and I just watched it tonight and I enjoyed every minute of it,  very funny.
lebron when you're going to quit trying to be like Mike
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 This movie sucked. It’s a perfect example of the saying: if it ain’t broke, don’t try to fix it.
Are they trying to say that women that take pride in being attractive can't also be good at basketball, can't have leadership skills, and are inappropriate for children? That's what the director said. That's so sexist, we should get this movie banned.
Looking like a double wide surprise... (sniffs the air deeply)   *GAWD DAAYUUUMMM*
Toon me in.
Marvel: We did the greatest crossover. Warner Bros: oh I don’t think so. Space Jam 2:
He should go get Jordan.
It has Shanequa Martin-Green from STD, Im out, cant stand anything even remotely associated with Kurtzman.
I ROCKED WITH IT! MADE ME FEEL LIKE THEY ABOUT TO BRING NBA BIG BACK‼️
Ha ha what’s up dad
ugh
1. How do i get my hands on those scotties? 2 who let avon in?
It's like cartoon is playing basketball with bugs but lobron is saves his son.
You can take the plot out of the movie and it would just be "Warner Bros. Movie (feat. Rick & Morty)."
Next Team to be on Space Jam is: Timmy Turner, Johnny Sins, Edd, Finn, Blossom, And don't forget of course Joe
We all love  👑 James
Pointless nostalgia aimed towards kids who don’t know the Looney Tunes and Lebron James the reprehensible Chinese Communist apologist. The fact they thought for any length of time this would be anything other than a flop is is astonishing
the best part was the rick and morty and the big chungus cameo that’s all
👎
Oh wow, such a diverse cast!!? I’m sure BLM will be proud.
This is for Kobe Bryant
Space Jam 2: A New Legacy Trailer 1 Starts At 4:30 Pm On My Nintendo Switch On Saturday 24th July 2021!
They should called this space James the story of  James the whole movie is about him and a giant billboard for him .. man f this movie
Που μπορώ να το δω ?
This movie was lame. Only good parts were Don Cheadle and the Toons. We watched the first Space Jam after, which  I never watched before. The first one is way better than this new copy. Glad it was free on HBO Max at least. I fell asleep during most of it, but not at all with the one with Jordan 25 years ago.
Wtf is "Tune World"
Man, honestly, the movie is not that bad.
Muito efeito perdeu a origem do filme space Jam  cadê Michael Jordan não gostei de verdade 😭
This trailer was way better than the movie itself
With that moron starring this movie, id rather go watch the origal on a nokia n95
How is no one talking about the fact that this has 23m views
2:25 funny 😂😂
Dislike for removing Pepe Le Pew.
I'm tired of all these reboots and sequels to shows and movies that didn't need any, just to have them ruined. Powerpuff Girls, The Patrick Star Show, now this? Just let our childhood cartoons be what they were, stop trying to remake and redo what has already been. Let these cartoons and movies be what they were, let them be a fond memory of our childhood and not this. And if not, for God's sake come up with something original for people to be disappointed in.
kunta kinte got his movie yay
Thanks for ruin it. What we expected from this patetic excuse of director
There were parts of this movie I liked, but you can never replace the original. First one was better.
🗑️
Warner brothers: do you guys want another space jam? Everyone: no Warner brothers: here you go. Also remember that we own all these other things? Also this has nothing to do with the original
disappointed they focused on 2 characters a solid 3/10 They should have focused on wabbit instead of his stupid non performance actor
At the end LeBron abandons his friends.
OMG 😱 Space Jam A New Legacy!
1:41 DROGON wait wait wait is dis we’re drogon go when Danny died? Well in another universe or something because well no way drogon got in there himself.
This movie is to inspire the kids of the next Generation.. I took my son To Watch this and he loved it, and so did I .
Superman, Gandalf, King kong, iron giant
Hot garbage.
Maybe it's because I never watched the first one but this just looks dumb and hella cringe
No
JUST READ MY NAME LMAO
Reference Jam 2: The Referencing
Family
True anti-creation, Warner should be proud. Also, notice the Rabbit girl looks a little more child like in this one, guess they want a different demographic lol (Pedos in Hollywood, who would have guessed)
It's Pixels all over again   It's supposed to be wacky and goofy, not BIG EXPLOSIONS & DRAMATIC FATHER SON RELATIONSHIP with a little wackiness.  I mean... seriously stop doing this.
Who’s Lebron James? I’m asking because I stopped watching basketball after the 1997-98 season.
When I heard the song day welcome to the space i got flashbacks is of my childhood listening to the space jam CD  theme on my walkman i still have the CD it's fire
Hiquifk
I waited the entire movie for them to play the Space Jam song... Not once did they play it, not even during the ending credits...
Terrible SJW BLM trash movie.   PASS!
They forgot to add the part where LeBron hurts himself and cries on the ground.
I just watched this and I wish I hadn’t
So Cool Lit 🔥 Up
3.4 on IMDB, really bad like-to-dislike ratio. GOOD I couldn't think of anything worse than watch this idiot try to act in front of a blue screen for over an hour.  WB so out of touch. Lots of people you could have picked but you picked this fool?  Now go ahead and censor my comment losers.
TNB from fecal matter
I was excited about this until the animation changed and it looked like everything other kids show on tv.
CCP James
it would be great if it stayed 2d
Yessir 🤟🏾🤟🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💯💯💯💯
I think 2 looks empressive and funny to me, at the end of the day it's a feel good, kiddie movie that isn't suppose to be taken seriously by adults who grew up through the 90s one. So they gonna go into this new version with a critical, over analytical adult mindset when there's no need to be🙄 just enjoy the film for what it is.
Bruh cmon they took out the scene that LeBron said “im shorter than Kevin hart”
LeBron James is terrible, he hates America yet so many look up to him. Movie is garbage and so in LeBron
king james LÖL
Was it really that bad? It looks so pretty I want it to be good.
What a garbage! Pathetic...
*Infinity War was the most ambitious crossover in history.* LeBron James: Hold my basketball.
I feel like I'm the only person in this world that actually likes this movie
R.I.P PEPE LE PEW
NOW I WACTH THE MOVIE IN MY FLIXER SPACE JAM A NEW LEGACY IM THE ONE
ㅇㅅㄹㅅ
At least MJ made a cameo 😂
Great movie. Imagine hating on a kids movie.
THE VISUALS ARE EVERYTHINGGGGGG😭
This is the most horrible thing to make a come back since the Corona
I bet someone is gonna make a nintendo version of this trailer
All Hail Space Jam, the Moron Lebron and China!!  Take part in the hatred of Police and the U.S.A and the slavery and imprisonment of people in China, just for their religion ...all in one glorious movie! Indoctrinate you’re children...and have some popcorn
Just finished watching this....  It is beyond terrible!
This movie is not another Sponge On The Run disaster that points the finger at COVID-19. It’s a stellar looking phenomenally animated movie. Yeah, some of the logic of when Lebron is a cartoon and when he’s real is kind of off, and honestly I wish they would’ve just thrown out the cartoon Lebron idea and stuck with the Space Jam, real basketball player, and cartoon loonies. But the HD real life looking loonies looked amazing, and took advantage of today’s HDR technology.  Wish Bill Murray could’ve cameoed at the end by complaining on how that could’ve been him again or something. /;D Then a remix of Fly To The Future by Seal.
Out with the old in with the new Goat
Okay but voice over "LeBron James" w/ that vine of the kid saying LeBron James.  (If it's already been done lmk😁)
Lol,first space jam movie >>>>>> sequel
Look how they massacred my boy.  Y'all keep making this CGI to proof yourself if you could that you forgot to stop for a brief moment and think if you should!
Leftist garbage film.
Puke fest
Are we forgetting the fact that this movie had a massive crossover. I mean Rick and morty in a pg rated movie, that’s crazy and I love this movie it was good
Crazy how many oldheads bang their heads against the wall on a movie made for kids xD My little sister watched it and she loved it and it is all that matters. If the kids like it then the movie is doing its job. For me personally it was an ok movie but I feel like the kids must judge this, not us :P
Omgggggggg
RMBJ NO MORE!
Oh no...
because im nice... heres lola bunny's scene 2:10
Nothing beats original MJ Space Jam. Nuff said. LBJ and new SJ is programming kids to become robots Transhumanism. 🤮🐑😷🤦‍♂️
Just watched it at the movie theatre and I liked it! My favourite part was the rap part!
The Rick and Morty reference in the movie is AMAZING.
Just saw it. Straight trash! Sorry. But Michael Jordan already set the bar on the old one.
this hurt to watch…
This movie was the bomb !!
Jordan could never 🤷‍♂️
Its the guy from fortnite omg
Kong: space jam jam jam
Safe to say this is one of the greatest animated movie disasters of the 2020s. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I am starting to be glad that PePe Le Pew didn't have to suffer being in this awful movie in the long run. It would have been an awful way for his character to go.   I will stick to the original; especially since Lola doesn't look like a knock of Slappy the Squirrel. Not to mention there was very good hand drawn animation while the characters were on the basketball court.
Everybody Get Up It’s Time To Slam Down We Got A Real Jam Going On Welcome To The Space Jam!
I figured looney tunes was too white for Lebrown James.
I just watched it today.
does anyone know the names to the songs that played during the basketball game? <3
Horrible that there is nothing of substance on offer for the youth of today.
Warner bros presents :kingdom hearts ft lebron James
Complete garbage 🗑😒😑🙃😐😕
Everyone be hatin on this movie, I loved it tho
Looks trash, the first movie was epic
They should of put kobe Bryant oh wait...
Leave classic alone period.👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
I played the movie yesterday. Couldn´t stand the terrible plot, the excessive special effects and the fact it´s a terrible imitation of MJ great original movie. Plus - They refer to Lebron as King James most of the movie - WTF?
Iron giant is the only thing that made me happy
Did he get permission to be a POC in a movie from the great leader of china?
I think it’ll be great stop the complaining
This looks like complete garbage, and LeBum is the worst narcissist.  Cringe worthy
bad
Did anybody see him pass the game of thrones sign on one of the planets?
It’s the guy from fortnite
Does he kind of remind you guys of Will Smith?
mopi
LeBron better flop
Went to the cinema today  6/10
"King James!", really. I repeat LeBron James is the most overrated athlete on the planet!
it’s a good movie I like it
another movie of blacks only ugh
A movie that is full of libtards that my kids will NEVER be allowed to watch.
Lebron James is just dewayne wades scottie pippin.
omg the movie was so BAD. the first one is 1000 times better
This is the worst movie ever made. More than half of the audience walk out after seeing 10 min of it. Congrats WB. #terrible #horrible #unbelievable #pathetic
SPACE JAM 1997 <3
👏🏽👏🏽
Granny going old school...😂😂😂
it's the guy from fortnite
I am surprised how much I liked this movie
Sad how ppl hate on it cause lebron was in the movie
Lebron shows more personality than MJ.  Sound track is better in the 1st. CGI is way better here. That dame time was awesome. My kids loved it
Spacejam has it all; rabbits a rooster, pig and a clown
the only reason i watch space jam, was because l i like Michael Jordan so much, space jam 2 i am not goin to watch it, becuase Lebron james suck's.
Shroom trip 😆🤣🤭
I went to watch a movie with my nephews and didn’t know it was gonna be this one… it SUCKED-
Jordan was so much better, in every sense.
King james? Cringe
garbage movie ....... LeBron is not MJ after all ofcourt or oncourt lol
BIG CHUNGUS IS IN SPACE JAM 2
Lebron dissapoints me
There is NO WAY 211k people liked this....
GARBAGE .....Lebronda Jane ....
Why? Why the trailer was cooler than the actual movie??? *sigh. 5/10.
Came here from The Weeknd post
Imagine there was Hulk as well ahhaha
You do too but you can do
They add in a Clockwork Orange and Austin Powers references but take out Pepé Le Pew… makes plenty of sense
Guess basketball aint paying as well these days
This looks fire
why they tough that making the toons on 3D was a good idea.....
I'm rather cringing 😬
no big chungus. 0/10
So LeMickey didn’t want to be with Disney anymore
Corporate garbage 🗑
LOOKS AWFUL, ABOMINATION ON THE OG
I don't understand with the bad reviews and the people thinks this movie is lame and boring bruh, honest review from me. This movie is great for kids and for adult that already watch Space Jam. I watched Space Jam when i was a kid and watching Looney Tunes playing basketball again is nostalgic, the animation is fun and entertaining. So many cameos of other characters and some of them in the scene for awhile. It has some life lesson too. Oh and yeah MJ appears too 🙃
Mind uploading 🖐🤘
fortnite
a
What a disappointment.........
It was okay, it’s a kids movie. Some parts seem a little off from basketball but it’s a cartoon and their jokes are not cringe if you know the references. People act like MJ movie was so good, it was just nostalgic though I also like the first space jam.
looks like it's not very diverse, too many bl ack people .. why? Don't we have equity or something?
Name should be "basketball in space"
So we're not just gonna talk about the Grandma that actually kicked a ball
just watched. Very bad movie.
Why does his wife look like a man ?
1:43 CAPTAIN CAAAVEEMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNN 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Original was way better than this latest one with lebron…..not saying anything wrong about lebron, I just think the storyline could have been better, for instance maybe the martians we’re seeking revenge for another game. Done creadles and the internet was just too much on trying to take over.
IMDb score of 3.8 says it all
So where are the protests about not having enough diversity in this garbage?
DOM SAVED LEMICKEY'S LEGACY. FIRST RAY ALLEN, THEN KYRIE, NOW HIS OWN DAMN SON. THATS IT. IM OFFICIALLY PUTTING LEBRON OUTSIDE OF MY TOP 10. ATP HES BEEN BAILED OUT FAR TOO MANY TIMES. BIRD, HAKEEM, SHAQ, MAGIC, KAREEM, DUNCAN, RUSSELL, KOBE, WILT, AND THE REAL GOAT MICHAEL JEFFERY JORDAN ARE ALL GREATER THAN THAT **FRAUD** KNOWN AS LEMICKEY "BAILED OUT BY HIS SON" JAMES
Lebron James? It's a NO for me.
you had one job: reincarnate michael jordan
This movie is gonna flop like Lebron does on the Court
Where I can see this movie ??
LeBron single handedly destroyed viewership of basketball. People do not like him. He is a horrible ambassador for the sport.      So who thought it was a good idea to put him in a sequel to the greatest basketball ambassador the sport ever had?      Hard fact. Were their more basketball fans when mj played? Or Lebroken james? Hmmm?
I saw it it's all free glad I didn't pay for this movie it was ok but the storyline is weak plus villain is very cheesy
So I noticed in Space Jam: A New Legacy that in the scene where Sylvester spits out Tweety and Speedy Gonzales(Gabriel Iglesias) says “You can smell it” is a little Easter egg referencing the famous Gabriel Iglesias story of when he got pulled over after getting donuts after making an illegal left turn and the cop asks Gabriel if he knew why he was pulling him over and Gabriel says “Cause you could smell it!”. Thought that was so cool that they added that in there!
A reminder the God loves you and Jesus died for your. sins💓 ( not tryna force. )
I don’t fucen care I love this make fun of it stupid people this movie was awesome
i watch that in the tv
So basically ready player one but Lebron is the main character
This is trash
The Worst Movie I've seen in years
I showed this to my 7 year old. He told me it looked dumb. I value his opinion.
Lebron James is trash in basketball! What made them think he would be good at acting😑
That was horrible!!! WTF I just watch?!
The amount of politically correct content in this movie is impressive. If you have any emotional triggers such as cartoon guns or a misogynistic skunk then this ones for you.  I give it a 9,500,000,000 /10  gow c it nowl
This movie: adds 2000s movie references  Also this movie: No Pepe Le pew reference...
Sooo...  LoonyToons+Hanabarbara+Horrormoviecharacters=SpaceJam2...
This movie was great, so good. I cracked up & really enjoyed it. Best space jam movie by far!
GARBAGEEEEEEE 🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑
This movie, much like LeBron, is a piece of s....
I was just watching that 😄
I'm boycotting this movie. Jordan's s.j. was cool... but CHINA LOVING LeBron James. Can KISS MY GRITS!
2:23 Clockwork Orange Crew (All White with top hats) wearing their classic jock strap/package puffer. Those who don't know Clock Work Orange is a group of rapist that commit a home invasion and rape a woman in front of her husband. Wonder who's idea that was, I guess they had to replace the skunk somehow. Geezz.
THIS IS SHOCKINGLY GREAT MOVIE!
Rip lola
for a second I thought he said maliqi haha😫😢😁 .. but he said malik very close 💪🙊🤙👋🖖🤟
Ok honest review. Yes I had my doubts about this “oh it’s too corny” “it’s not like the original”  but overall it wasn’t bad at all. If you liked the first Space Jam then you will like this one. You have to understand it’s meant for a certain audience. (kids) so once that factor is gone you’ll enjoy it. It’s worth a watch. Plus spoiler alert....           MJ makes an appearance....
WARNING: THIS MOVIE IS AS BAD AS IT LOOKS
This movie is so bad that my 2 year old begged me to turn it off after 4 minutes…. He didn’t have to beg me too bad. Lebron is so bad that I could watch another minute myself. Terrible.
Saw this movie and my opinion , i think it was awesome
In Loving Memory Of  Kobe Bryant (1978-2020)
Warner Bros: Lebron, we want another space jam movie with you in it.  Lebron: You have to refer to me as the king as much as possible.
i love watching space jam 2 like my best animated movie
LeBron James bless you and your entire family for eternity Amen
25 years later. man, where has the time gone
Looks horrible
Who know where to get the movie for free
Seriously did they animate this in 2 weeks?
Why does space jam 1 look better than space jam 2 made nearly 3 decades ago?
Seems like too many layers conceptually.   This is ostensibly a Looney Tunes movie guest starring Lebron James, but having the real world and the toon world further seperated by an overarching internet world confuses that premise to the point of convolution.
es mala a mas no poder  enserio perdieron el tiempo con esta cosa que dinero tan mal gastado ya no tiene creatividad es un refrito de mal gusto no hay una historia definida y todo es demasiado rápido y ni siquiera explican de donde salió el malvado  ni que paso con el ,me imagino a los escritores de esto como a los enanos malvados de la primera película dándose  golpes en la cabeza y el resultado es esto , sentí lo mismo que siente uno cuando compra un helado y se le cae una puñetera M MUY GRANDE
I'm tryna smoke a crippling amount of weed and watch this. Like now.
LJ is trying too hard to make himself the goat by emulating MJ in everything he does even using his jersey number and doing this dumb movie. Understand one thing that LJ will never do; Win 2 tree peats with the same team. MJ even came back after retirement to do this.
The old one is way better… js
hey
I actually understand why this movie was delayed for so long now. They were tirelessly pumping money into acting lessons for Lebron to absolutely no avail.
THE IRON GIANT IS IN HERE ?! AHHHHH I LOVE
CCP SAYS HI... Oh, you guys thought LeCHINA James was a good idea? TROLLOLOLOLOL
i think they should have just left it i feel like the ruined it
What a stupid choice for an actor.
I actually like this and I'm kinda excited to see it.
Space Jam ANL is like Lebron's career compared to Jordan's. It too was not as great and made less money.
Next time if you need another Michael Jordan I'm right here and that my name after my father. So Warner Bros hook me up.
This movie is literally all about James and how he became a good basketball player 🤦🤦🤦 this shouldn't even be called space jam 🤦. Trust me don't watch this money grab garbage. He literally can't go a few minutes without talking about how "great" he is lol it's so desperate 🤦
I wonder if they will be kneeling before the game.
FINALLY I WAITING FOR 25 YEARS!!!!!
One question: why?
Pretty bold move, I’ll stick to the OG original.
lebron james is trash
Why is Kong in this movie
“Mehhhhhhhhhh wassup dad”
2:16
2:17
Queen Lebron. Sh ut up,stop "acting", and dribble.
cancer
I love space jam
After watching Michael Jorden in the original I would have a very hard time watching this one.
Needs more Chinese
☭
Looks pretty awful but i love BLM so i guess its good
THE IRON GIANT?? I loved that movie
And lebron loses in space jam also lmao
If they make this a game on the PS5 IT will be AMAZING!!!!!!    cuz I already have a PS5
Can confirm , Michael Jordan is in it
Terable
WHERE IS THE SPACE JAM SONG?  I'm not satisfied without that song, seriously 🥺
Fun fact: Space Jam 1 came out when I was 6 years old. Now the sequel is out as my first child is turning 6  For everyone whos trying to do the math😂 I am a woman born 1990 and my son was born 2015
No thanks
out of so many they picked lebron lol
no thanks
Lemon jaaames
I thought this movie would be fake.
What's up doc
I can’t believe they let a white cowboy with guns be in this movie 😢 poor Leboner James will probably encourage protests outside movie theaters
Is la biter James ever going to do anything original. U can't erase his legacy. The real #23
It’s out
I read that this movie is garbage.
I just saw the movie
where tf is lola bunnies curves
Movies pretty good
Looney Tunes Mystery Dungeon
Straight rip of ready player 1. An this is how it ends. The monsters are up 100-95. There is 2 minutes left in the game. Bugs scores. Then Daffy steals the ball an also scores. Its 100-99. They say it's up to you lebron we have 3 seconds on the clock an down by 1.... LeBron naturally gets the ball. Drops it on the floor an walks off court. The monsters win. An take his son an also destroy earth.
I've seen the full movie, all i can say is the old Space Jam was way better  Do you agree?
It’s out now
Still trash 🗑 can who got sweep in the finals 😂 6 nba losses
I need in tamil
Hahaha how do you make 2 great things, basketball and looney tunes look boring....? Get Malcolm and his 6 writers. Who are the idiots that approved this for production???? Give me the cash and let me make a movie...
black tunes
Can’t wait to see the movie today at the movie theaters with my two cousins
It turned from a basketball battle against aliens, to a battle for the multiverse.
Wow That Character Lebron James Bro And Bugs Bunny And Lola Bunny
🖕Lebron
1:57
doesnt look good, still gonna watch
Back the Blue!!!
I’m pretty sure Lebron  wins an Oscar for this film.
Space Jam 2: Comes out Teachers: *”Class, I know what we’re going to do today”*
If them really be in real life, Im gonna cry alot 😭😭
everything about this is super cringe, thats why its for children
Friday 16 2021
It looks like he's going to be a better actor than MJ
And as expected, it is widely considered one of the biggest flops of all time. (just like it's star)
Avengers, ASSEMBLE...
Passing on this. Can’t support a guy who profits off of slave labor.
If this doesn't have Drama Queen James making a fool of himself falling all over the place every time someone breathes too close to him, y'all ain't done it right. I'm glad I grew up on the good one.
6 rings and a better movie
“I want a movie that’s like space jam but more references, worse story and not in space”.. this is how we ended up with this atrocity... OG space jam is the only space jam!
Everyone do the flop LeBron does LeFlop
Staring LeFlop James
I love the crossover tho
I been waiting for this movie my whole life and the critics are already giving out bad reviews on this film. Come on, if they hate space jam so much why are they even bothering to watching it?  This is exactly why it took so long to make a sequel because people can’t stop hating on Space Jam.
flightposite! if you know, you know! classic.
Space jam 1: MJ helps looney toons win a basketball game  Space jam 2: lebron needs help from the looney toons
This movie was really good.
When I then start simping over bug bunnies in real life
Yo, Xi Jingping is DARK!
Ah yes the original movie made people want to do the dirty with a rabbit is getting a sequel
This movie just came out today!
Looks kinda lame tbh. Ah well. Gotta squeeze that money machine.
They ruined Lola Bunny..
It is not the one which was made in 1992
Well, Sonequa Martin-Green just ruined her career just by being in this movie.
Like they said in the first Space Jam, just stick to basketball 😂
whatever he does will never become Michael Jordan
1:11 bugs bunny.:EH was up doc
I know I won't be the first to say it, and I for sure won't be the last  But its something I must get off my chest, it's truly important to ask  Although the movie looks pretty good and the effects are far from trash  Somebody please tell me where is lol bunny's fine a-
I’m always here for the Tunes to fight War Machine
Wow beautiful movie i love it🥰🥰🥰specially lebron😘
Why is his wife played by an actor?
Jueves 15 de julio de 2021 espere mucho para esta pelicula, y no me desepciona pero la verdad es que esparaba más que un comercial, y se merece mas esta pelicula no solo por encajar a lo nuevo, Warner Brothers, no sean como otras empresas que solo les interesan vender, ustedes son mas que eso, no soy critico pero la verdad nesesita unos arreglos solo para que yo disfrute del regreso de los looney Toones como se debe si se puede. #RestoreSpacejamanewlegacy. Si se Puede 🙃
Where is Michael Jordan?
What does this have to do with space?
I might get to see this tomorrow!
I love this sequel
This just looks unspeakably awful.
@ 0:35 lol a Game of Thrones reference in Space Jam. Okay then.
Could is get any worse than this?
Can’t wait till tomorrow
Still say the 1996 version was the best and only one that should never be duplicated.
Ryan Coogler what are you doing here? Is there literally nothing you won’t say no to?
" I Really Love 💘 you Kaya Klitschko "
The movie is coming out tomorrow!
Tomorrow I’m gonna watch it! But after school
Space Jam: A New Legacy
.
2:23 clockwork orange?
When we kids are grown up a new space jam will come out🥲
LeBron haters bouta become cinema experts come tomorrow
Bad acting james
Thumbs up for Jordan. Comment for Lebron 😎

YOU'RE NEXT #ACCOUNTABILITY. Seems just as fitting here as its original location!
Lebron needs the Chinese flag on his uniform, and Anthony Davis's character needs to be be called "Street Clothes"
Did anyone else notice Pennywise is in this
Kobe Bryant would be proud to see this in heaven together with his daughter Gigi 😇
When king kong came from the Kong skull Island 🤣
1:42 YABBADABBADOO
Complete movie in 2:37 minutes :D
1:12 neeh que hay de nuevo viejo
*Lebrony Selling out to Chy-Naa.*
ITS THE GUY FROM FORTNITE
‏أي watch شات
Man LeBron wants to be Jordan so bad.
I have figure of Space jam Is Lola Bunny
kinda cool
u cant kick the basketball granny
This went from an animation to 3D
Sigh..
Rumor has it the original line was:  "I need to assemble an elite team to get my hairline back"  Unfortunately, James wasn't too happy with attention being brought to it in spite of how obvious it was. So, they changed line and as an added apology used CGI to make his hair look fuller than it really is.  Also, using "Tune World" instead of "Toon World" wasn't an accident, everyone was genuinely stupid enough to believe it was spelled that way. Interestingly, they were all staunch supporters of "Common Core" and "CRT".  Not sure if there's a link there, but, yeah, there's definitely a link there....
Did I just see scooby doo, the flint stones and King Kong?
I've never seen anything in my life as painful as that dialogue coming from Looney Tunes characters. Why does this exist?
Is this going to flop as hard as LeBron as well?
Please release in Tamil also please
"...and I took that personally"
Kevin Durant not the lead bad guy? Yo fack you dont ever text me again
Do they ever address the OTHER time it all came down to a looney game of basketball?? I would think Bugs would be like "hey remember 25 years ago when this happened? What'd we do then?" Or does space jam 1 just not exist in this one
YouTube erasing dislikes , protecting LeChina
Tom and Jerry have to be there
Oh, oh god... It looks like someone took a page from Ready Player One...
This will be garbage.
It's sad they are going to let king flop ruin something else. I wonder if king flop leads the tunes in a political on court demonstration. LeBron James is a garbage shill for the CCP that called for retribution of an officer that saved a girls life. I bet this movie flops as hard as LeBron does.
Truvada has better ads, but the same actors
Next, I wanna see one with Lebron and Michael Jordan working together
Bad song, bad trailer.... 1996 version wins.
My summary of the plot: War Machine lets his suit become a permanent part of him, and becomes an AI, then kidnaps LeBron James and forces him to play basketball. Also Bugs Bunny
LaButtface, won’t be as good as Jordan at this either.
This movie would have a much better chance if it didnt include LeBron James.  LeBron doesn't have the same star power as Michael Jordan and wont have the same ability to draw in viewers as MJ did.  As a matter of fact....he has the opposite effect.
I like space jam a new legacy because the space jam 1996.
don't know if it will as good as space jam 1
This is bad and you should feel bad for making it all you developers working on this.
Boring Movie of ALL Time !!!!
chills with the music
July 16 is my birthday
1:18 can king kong play basket ball
Am I the only one that’s not excited for this? They’ll never make movies like they use to and it’s sad.
The lack of ORIGINAL content these days in AMAZING to me!
#SlaveLaborMadeLeBronProducts #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica #MadeInChinaSlaveFactory
Mj: Arm stretches to make half court shot Lebron: Feet stretches to make half court shot
You tried to redo with this clown?
What a terrible actor lol no better then jordan
So no mention of MJ at all? Like I dont like Lebron the movie looks good and I want to watch it but does it just step on MJs Space Jam?
Kong 1:44
Whoever dislikes sucks at basketball
This is just the Hollywood remake of 2010 Bollywood Film Toonpur Ka Superrhero!! 😂      Except this has LeBron and Micheal and they play a different game LoL!!!
Is this what Don Cheedle does in his spare time
When I first saw the design for Lola in "A New Legacy", I was very disappointed... And Kath Soucie was originally going to voice Lola, but she got recasted. I was also disappointed...
jordan looks funny did he get surgery?
Why is Cartoon LeBron James of lighter complexion  than actual LeBron James??  Do y'all need some Dark Skin color palettes??    MMM.  That's shameful. Why make him a cartoon?  Micheal Jordan wasn't a cartoon.  If youre not able to do It right,  Don't do It.   #Black&Proud  #SkinToneMatters!!!

2 more day is here
First movie -- looks awful  2nd movie -- won't watch it. Looks garbage! Don't liked the basketball. Ugh! *VOMIT*
NO! Just no!
I hope this movie fails I may be only in my 30's ,but my childhood memories are nothing to be played with. That means changing how any character looks is not good and I bet others feel the same. I mean if your favorite superhero was changed from your childhood memories you would care but it seems like all people care about is money. I guess looney tunes doesn't care. Also how dare Malcolm D. Lee says Lola is over sexualized look at Jessica Rabbit and her big breast!
It would be good if LeBron James wasn't in it.
That looks sick I ain't going to lie
BRO seeing The Iron Giant at 1:40 makes me so happy, all the other characters too, I can't wait to watch this
Why didn't they just use bronny or bryce
I could see this turning into a battle royale
where’s vin diesel
1:46 when Don Cheadle finds out he’s nominated for an Emmy for a show he’s only in for a minute

*When I saw tech, different worlds, different character in one (like The Iron Giant) Me: Ready Player One?
Why are there no white people???
Your my favourite movie maker :)
Pretty sick movie, seeing all the different movies they travel into while looking for the other looney characters was pretty sick
RL Grime - Scylla for trap song
They really took pepe lepew out lmao . Definitely not watching this garbage
🤦‍♂️ pass !! . No monstars tf !! I rather just watch ready player one.
An elite team:1superman2gandalf3kingkong5irongiant
They should off put Samuel L. Jackson in this movie😂
I hope it's available on any movie viewer
I Love Lebron James because he's a cool nba player and he's my dad's favorite! He's also really great at acting in that movie
This is some Ready Player one Stuff here
I wonder why LeBron didn't come up with his own movie. Why does he have to steal Jordan's basketball number and copy his movie? Is he trying to be Michael Jordan?
"Coming soon to Video and Dvd"
I know I'll be going to the space jam soon.
Space jam 2 a new legacy coming soon in 2021
ITS THE GUY FROM FORTNITE
lebron james
I think it will be a great movie honestly I mean after all you can't really compare it to the original because it has two different story lines which is dope but it's true what they say some people just can't accept the fact that there's nothing wrong with being different everybody following the same trends and yall don't even know it just sit back be grateful and enjoy seeing lebron and the looney tunes on the big screen together 💯
The fact that Everybody's Circulation is not the theme song for this movie is a sin.
they changed the music? In the ad there was wap playing.
The original came out when I was 12 and have always enjoyed it, albeit Mike's acting was dreadful.   This digital flash Space Jam just takes away the authenticity feel, but...  I'm still gonna watch it when it premieres on 3 grams of mushrooms, for this seems like absolute eye-candy for the psychedelic experience!                                                                                                          🎬🍄✌️😎🍺🎞️
I look Alley Op
Not sure if Lebron flops more on the court or at the box office?
Oh yeah! Well here’s my cool team!!!  1) Spider-Man  2) Edward Elric 3) Godzilla  4) Megazord
Did not know LeBron had a kid 😲
Space Jam reminds me of the Harlem Globetrotters
Its looks like galactic football in better graphics
1:46 my man It just watching the game
Micheal Jordan space jam is better. the real goat is Micheal Jordan lebron just wan” to be like Micheal Jordan but sorry you will never be the real thing
Incredible, Authent🔥c and Extraordinary 😎
They should make a steph curry space and maybe  kobe
I am going to watch this movie
So litttttt
I would of preferd that they made this movie with Kobe Bryant
Why is Pennywise and in they
did anyone else see hogwarts pop up on the screen?
Haha 😂
It looks great. I’d never give any money to Lebron tho. Not ever.
bring my talent to the space
Damn they ruined a classic
Looks weird
Granny ain’t playing 😂
Flaccid
I can produce diarrhea also
Kobe was supposed to be here
The villains look kinda boring i like the originals more
Remember back when people had original ideas?
The plot is similar to a Bollywood movie named "Toonpur ka superhero"
2:34
Can u put in netflix pleaseeeee..💗🥺
haha lola bunny
IM gonna watch this today!😃
I wish bron made that jump
i love lebron james scream he had short legs
Nike: write that down...Write That Down! WRITE THAT DOWN
if big chungus is not there i will cry
Oh damn the gramma kicks it sick
I watched it today!
Welcome to the space jam
terrible
3d. . .
LeBron doesn’t play a lick of defense in this movie just like real life!
Candy crush moment
This movie is fire and I love the trailer
My daughter was a year old when the first one was released.  I am looking forward to this one.
Why is there only black actor? Where’s other races?
Most people on here just don’t like Lebron ..if it was Luca doncic with the same role there would be no complaints lol
Aww I was hoping it would stay as old-school animation...but I guess kids would hate that these days. Just like I couldn't watch old movies in black and white when I was a kid lol. I get it. It's time to pass it on to a new generation x
S.T.O.K.E.D.
LETS GO KING JAMES PUMP UP JAM💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨 ISSO É PELO JORDAN SEU MONSTROS DE UMA *****😤😤😤😈
So looks like Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam are using guns again and again in Looney Tunes Cartoons with guns returning.
Lost all respect to LeBron not worth watching
This movie is gonna bomb lol.
Iron Giant will make an appearance, at least
I’m willing to give this movie a chance we don’t know it could be really good
Yabba dabba do
This movie is W.B. movie not Space Jam.🙃
02:10 LeBron and Dwayne Wade moment
somethings should just be left alone like space jam2 is the disapointing older brother it dosen't look good
As if we haven't had ENOUGH of this CLOWN!
What if they made a movie where Hanna Montana did a crossover with Hanna-Barbera?
Although it’s gonna be decent, it just doesn’t feel right. Without Michael Jordan, it just feels when weird
Were is Godzilla I see Kong but where’s godzilla
Flop - pass
Shang Tsung would have been great on this one...he steals souls during a basketball match, and Lebron gets really pissed and challenges him one on one
i dont see any comments talking about pennywise being in the movie ;-; 1:46
Kung-fu Kenny!!!
1:18 I would really want to see a basketball team of LeBron James, SuperMan, Gandalf, King Kong and the Iron Giant
This a spoiler btw so if you haven't watched the movie, best not to look         I was so hyped because in one scene, they said MJ was coming to the locker room but was so disappointed when Michael B Jordan came on screen lmao
M.J 🐏
I feel like curry's next in for a movie like this😂😂😂😂
I really want to watch space jam
Not interesting as the first one sorry
2:14
So in the first space jam it was live action Michael Jordan in a cartoon world, but in this one its cartoon LeBron James in a cartoon world, but then he turns back into normal LeBron James and all the looney tunes go CG? Looks good
this is literally just a "ok heres some more space jam, we're just gonna shove in some new stuff to make it look interesting so deal with it lol" moment and i couldn't be happier
That scene where lola thru it up to bron and they did what lbj and wade did was a masterpiece
1:33 to 1:51 is my favorite part of the whole trailer!
I prob won’t be watching it just cuz Lebron james is in it
It this movie would be better then the last one
Oh man this looks like it's going to be absolutely awful.
I'm surprised lebron's Chinese overlord's would allow him to make such a bad movie!
They should of put Micheal Jordan in there somewhere even a cartoon version would of been good
SPOILERS              There is a direct rick and morty cameo
The presence of the iron giant earned this a like.
Oh great. Woke is as woke does: ruin any and every good thing. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Hard pass here.
i will not see this movie because of kobe bryant he will not be anything but a has been basketball player who should keep his big mouth shut.
Lebron James
Lebron is just not likeable like mj. Thats become apparent during that sprite xmas commercial thats (annimated.) They show the character smiling and thats when i realized he hardly smiles. Also...he's a politically hypocritical.  When it came to critisizing china, he back peddled real fast when he was reminded where the $ was coming from. I dont need to be preached to by some over paid athlete thats real good at putting a round thing thru another round thing. Basketball is over rated. Just check its stats compared to other sports.
So Rhodey was the antagonist
So cool
#ReleaseThePepeLePepeCut
I think it's cool,that this one has Looney Tunes and Hannah Barbera characters in it.
Wackkkkkkk this is pure garbage not even the cartoons want to be in that movie ...... I wish we can reboot it with baseball and put jeter in it
In the trailer though it has so many references lol
Never, in a million years, would I think space jam would get a sequel
I'm SO watching this!
The animation of the looney tunes from the 96's version seemed better than this colored-up glow of a version.
Why is the dude wearing a Planet of the Apes mask?
lose son, loony tunes, characters, training, pump up moment, they lose round 1, the win the next, everyone is happy.  end.
In this trailer you can find jack Nicholson's joker Dannys penguin 60s Penguin Arnold's Mr freeze agent Smith pennywise the mask the iron giant king Kong the mystery Machine and the gang a Star wars reference and many more Easter eggs       EASTER EGGS              THE            MOVIE
My dream Warner Bros team:  Courage the Cowardly Dog, Scooby doo, Mao Mao, Tom and Jerry, Yakko Wacko and Dot Warner, Dexter, the Mask (Jim Carrey), Flash, Pikachu, Steven Universe, Mordecai and Rigby, Finn and Jake, Johnny Test and Dukey, Samurai Jack, Billy Grimm and Mandy, Chowder, Kids Next Door, Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble, Ben 10, Generator Rex, Garfield and Odie, Ami and Yumi, the Powerpuff girls, Ed Edd and Eddy, Robot Boy, Finn and Jake, The Jetsons, Johnny Bravo, Astro Boy, Megaman, Harry Potter, Frodo, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Zatana, Green Arrow, Aquaman, Hawk girl, Teen Titans, Skunk, Symbiotic Titan, Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang  Humans:  Jeremy Lin, Shaquille O'Neal, Micheal Jordan, Magic Johnson, Klay Thompson, Uncle Drew
For a second, they made LeBron shorter than Kevin Hart. Kevin probably saw that as a win.
space jam after watching space jam and MJ docs several times I can't fight the urge to question the needed a sequel.
Remember your tweet tho that's why I won't be seeing your movie
Down vote for Lebron
I bet his secret stuff is woke koolaid.
So this what Rhodey do during the blip
This will never be as good as the original one
You are the best space Jam movie
Bugs hasn't aged a day!
LeGone to LeChina 😂
1:46
Never ending nice 👍🏼
🌹🌹🌹
Trying be MJ
I love you Looney Tunes.
Cant help but think that if LJ was working with his team instead of being all hollywood and filming a movie, Lakers would be in the finals instead of the Suns. Priorities I guess, LJ makes more off court than on. His lack of competitiveness and lack of passion to be the best is why he will never be like Mike
Are the tunes gonna use LeBron's secret stuff?
The iron giant is in it now I got to watch thiw
Im gonna 420 so hard before I watch this... A color fluckfest.
TERRIBLE choice, Lebron is NOT a goat.
Oh this looks a lot of fun, I loved the original which OMG!!! is it really over 20+ years ago but after with all the lockdown madness this I think is the kinda movie we all need perhaps
I Like When Kong is here XD
lEbROn JaMEs
Boooooooo
Mj thinks it's funny you should see his reaction
Stick to kneeling.
When LeBron was challenged to a game of basketball, he should've said "You want some of this? You got it."
I wish they would stop nostalgia baiting us using the iron giant just to get us to give them money
LeBron a terrible actor.
I like that they did the muppets universe
This movie is a major reference bomb
Make sure this movie is not a money grab and stop you’re caring on greed please?  From Matthew Zangwill
When I saw "F9" I yelled out "WHAT'S UP DOC?"
😂
I hope the Iron Giant and King Kong didn't smoosh anyone.
I AM NOT WATCHING THIS JUNK BECAUSE THE NERDLUCKS FROM THE FIRST SMACE JAM MOVIE ISN'T IN THIS
Michael Jordan is better
I love African American main characters in any social media Racism stops now
i heard these movie have alot of nba players get injured lol
i wish its less like power rangers meets transformers and more like the first one we all loved
I’m actually excited
Props to Lebron for doing his acting thing 👏🏾
When I saw the trailer I was excited because I like basketball and I saw all the different movie characters in the one ☝️ movie ( King Kong, mystery   Gang etc)
this movie feels like its trying too hard in my opinion. it also feels like they're trying to be the PG endgame or something idk if this is just me
I can’t wait to much this
I'M WATCHING THIS
Wow this looks so good,  I had the video of space jam and never brought it on DVD I can’t wait for this to come out on Disney or blueray
The movie looks cool
Yoo wtf Harambe is in this. This movie still looks like garbage, where’s Lola’s bust? Hollywood sure is getting lazy to have the audacity to revive classic gems, which is impossible
1:26
At least his cartoon’s acting isn’t as bad as his actual acting
don cheadle: boom! you looking for your son!
Between both of these trailers, I think Granny might end up being the best part of this movie.
absolute trash, pure consumerist garbage
1:40 Is that a _rathalos_ flying over the Iron Giant? Jeez this really is just Space Jam crossed with reverse Tron Legacy crossed with RP1... Edit: NVM, the dragon is from GoT. The world makes sense again.
Looks great! I loved the MJ Original  in the 90s but due to the main star being a toxic BLM activist that tweets hateful garbage I’ll be giving this a miss.
:/ WTF
1:07 LeBron James as a cartoon character. 🙂🎥
Just one word: WOW!
This film on 2022
i really hope this lives up to space jam. i think space jam is one of those greatest films that should have never been sequeld
Is bug is going to say what’s up Doc again
1:42 I think that's Samurai Jack.
It looks horrible... 😳🤣😂
But y, they should have done it years ago with kobe instead
Good for him and his son they didn't fall in Westeros world lol, that would be f*cked up hahhaa just imagine the stuff they'd have to do to get out of there lmao
I am surely going to the cinema and pay to watch this movie!
Which is better  Looney Tunes or Nickelodeon version
Wow I can't believe this they made the Looney Tunes come alive 25 years later this seems a perfect sequel to the first film I'm loving this new semi animated theme 😍👍🏻
i will not be watching it
This combined cool world and ready player one
Geezus, this looks absolutely dreadful, painful.  Lebron acting is as stiff as a board.
Much better if Michael Jordan was back in this sequel
Space Jam + Ready Player One = Space Jam: A New Legacy
I Didn't Quite Find Tom and Jerry Yet I Found Yakko Wakko and Dot Chillin On Marvin The Martian's Space Ship. why cant tom and jerry just be in here plzzz WB
1996: Toon squad vs monstars   2021: toon squad vs Goon squad
I’m excited
Litty
who agrees the OG version is better
Can't wait to see this!
Look at time 146 and look in the right corner Recoment what u see
And I took that personally
Lemao is a joke.
What did they do to my Lola Bunny 😭
Definitely getting high af before I watch this movie
1:07
Will they be selling this to China too?
0:01 Why does the switch look more like a bootleg Wait...      Cause it IS a bootleg 👁👄👁
Tune squad vs goon squad
The animation of bugs eating the carrot was awful. Whoever does cartoons for them these days are just super lazy animators. Makes me sad. Hopefully the movie is good. I loved the MJ one.
Kobe Bryant would be better for this movie😔 rip the legendary Black Mamba.
My kids or anyone I know will not be watching anything with that man in, I've heard enough of his thoughts to know the type of person he is and not a single penny of my money will be going towards him.
Pixle vibes ....
So, after telling the police how to do their jobs, Toons are next?
It seems like a flop to me...
Nope not going to watch cry baby james guess he not the best basketball player in the world he going to take his purse with him
Lebron is overrated he isn't the GOAT its Michael Jordan, someone might become better than Michael Jordan but it sure isn't "King James"
I’m being so Fr but this movie is so garbage and cringy and the only reason someone would want to watch it is because lebron James is in it
The Bron jame
In order to save both their animated world and LeBron James' live action world, Bugs Bunny and his friends; Lola Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, The Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote, Yosemite Sam, Foghorn Leghorn, Elmer Fudd, Sylvester and Tweety, Marvin the Martian, K-9, Gossamer, Taz the Tasmanian Devil, Speedy Gonzales, and Granny Webster teams up with LeBron James, Fred Flintstone, Barney Rubble, Betty Rubble and Wilma Flintstone, Pebbles Flintstone and Bam-Bam Rubble, Penelope Pitstop, The Iron Giant and his best friend King Kong, Scooby Doo! and the Mystery Inc., Jabberjaw, Speed Buggy, Captain Caveman, several Hanna Barbera characters, The Mask, Pennywise the It clown, several classic Warner Bros horror film villains, several classic Warner Bros movie heroes and villains, Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, Robin the Boy Wonder, Cyborg and DC heroes, The Joker and several DC villains, The Game of Thrones characters and many more to rescue LeBron's wife, two teenage sons and youngest daughter from an evil sentient computer A.

Lame James just wants to be like mike but never will be. Coby was and always will be better than lebron.
i cant wait to see this!
We are the biggest Easter egg is King Kong is here oh my God oh my good
Who else lost interest in this movie after witnessing Lebron and the Lakers get eliminated on the 1st round of playoffs?
PLEASE JUST FOR ME COME ON.
My toxic fan base is gonna hate this movie but I am gonna love it
2:22 Harden robot
Boycott boycott boycott
Wtf it was supposed to be him and loony tunes not the whole WB characters. I hope its not gonna be a mess.
For the record, he trained his whole life to prepare for this movie
I did NOT expect to see Michael Burnham in this trailer
this just raped my whole childhood
When he's not out there telling black people that they can't step out the house without being hunted by police, he's starring in cartoons. Further proof he's not living in reality.
You had me at Evil Don Cheadle...
“I’m Going Old School 🏫 On Their Behind”
The graphics are amazing
1:39 Welcome To......................THE SPACE JAM!
I'm sorry but after watching this I think, I really do believe that the original Space Jam with the 🐐 dunks on this. Reason being is that for me personally this one with Lebron just looks way to over the top detailed to the max. Like to much is going on. Simple is more. Space jam with MJ was truely ahead of its time, i can say this because if what I just watched is the CGI effects of 2021 then space jam with the 🐐 was not far behind :)
Warner Bros.: Alright, people.... We can't let the kids get influenced by a skunk who perpetuates rape culture.  Also Warner Bros.: You know who needs to watch this basketball game? Those nice fellas from A Clockwork Orange.
I SOO HAPPY SAM HAVE HIE GUN BACK
The war machine is in space jam 2
I know Michael Jordan upset lol
Aaaand all furryfetish ppl get triggered by Lola in 3...2...1...
How do they have copyright of Ironman
If this is just another woke mess sequel I don't think I'm ever going to watch another Hollywood film again
Ehhhhhhhhh what’s up doc
I like how they included monsterverse kong in this movie! They should as put a smaller version of legendary godzilla sitting in the stands aswell
🤢🤮 Lola 🤮🤢
One thing you better believe, he took this very personal!
Looks cool
I already thought we wouldn't see it, but it's finally here
Space jam with Michael Jordan still the best
It’s probably a big mistake rebooting this
bruh why no nba jam refrence 2:12 like fr bro if he made it and some announcer said HES ON FIRE would have been awesome
ham hovedpersonen ligner Anish
If only they choose football(soccer units)
Space jam where is martian?
hope its not full of pc junk
Granny got handles for days hall of fame
This looks like trash
I sure hope Penelope Pussycat will have a major appearance instead of a cameo appearance. And talk too.
Don't take the bait with this movie
2:04 2:15
From The Creators of Wonder Woman & Tom & Jerry
You mean Cyber Jam
This looks so bad and I’m actually embarrassed that these remakes are all Disney is capable of making for the box office… what a joke and how pathetic… could’ve gave this dude an original movie, despite him profiting off Chinese slavery, but we get an overly exaggerated and over explained simple plot and a child blackmailed 😂😂 WHAT. A. JOKE.
So basically ready player one, but it's not a video game..
2:22
2:15 my reaction to this trailer
Toonpoor ka superhero part 2 in Hollywood 🎬
i kinda hate this cuz its its just a bad  copy of the first one with Michael Jordan
I expect to see Tom & Jerry in this movie.
Wow, that looks dope!
Can't wait to watch it with my family.
Is it just me or I love it when they say “🎶Welcome to the space jam🎶”
BEST EVERRRR
Shame Pepe Le Pew got removed from this to even him getting banned altogether. 😔
SSSHHHHEEeeeeesssshhhhh. ready player one vibes

I can’t Find Emmet From LEGO movie
This is either going to be okay, or it's going to be really, really, really, really damn horrible. Either way, I'm excited.
Space Jam 3 don't I don't like
1:39 the mystery machine (with Scooby himself hanging out the window), one of the dinosaur excavators, amazonian warriors, a spartan warrior, Zorro 1:41 the iron giant in front of the evil scientist's castle 1:42 Drogon the dragon and Samurai Jack (very briefly seen) 1:43 the Flintstones and the Rubbles, the Jetsons, Yogi and Boo Boo, Jabberjaw, Captain Caveman, Magilla Gorilla, the road rovers (on the right), Yakko and Dot, Cheetara and Penelope Pitstop 1:44 Migo, Mechee, Gwangi, King Kong (who is surrounded by biplanes) and Peter Potamus' time traveling balloon
0:39 the cyclone looks like from the wizard of oz
htey should have took bronny as the son
👀  ALL the "haters showed up here, in the comment section  the same way all the haters will show up (front & center) to WACTH the actual movie when it aires
M.J. made it work, L.J. will ruin it cause of politics...
1:39 1:41 2:14 1:42 1:45 1:44 0:31 1:40 1:23 1:46
Can’t believe that they Include a struggling rapist in this movie.
don't get your hopes up like coming to america 2
only mj is space jam
1:07 that was the worst scream ever.
Well im guessing the older didn't get to play a role because hos grades was low?
not the hero we wanted but the hero we needed
I mean iron gaint is in the mix so kinda
Infinity War was the most ambitious crossover in history. Warner Bros: hold our shield
It would be better with a brutal metal breakdown right here but ok
Where is the animaniacs
Oh my gosh it’s here
Lame.
Are all remakes gonna be blm version now?
Plot twist: it was uploaded two days two late
2:28 to 2:33 i laugh so hard
*whats up doc*
Honkai impact 3 movie
1:44 that's Kong right ?
DROGON
Super Space Jam ultimate. EVERYONE IS HERE
Im waiting for my ticket
The Mask! you know what that means....
Why they gat put lebron James  ... just why They should've put shack instead
Lmao in the second trailer, when he got sent into the looney toon world, he said “Agh! I look shorter then Kevin Hart!” Lmao.
The remix is a different feel and this movie is a different vibe ready player one vibes!
Hmm 🤔
This seems like a full movie version of that family guy skit about disney & the 2 cows with backwards hats and gold chains sayin YOU DA COW! NO YOUUUU DA COW!!" and the kids saying "WOW! DISNEY REALLY GETS US!" lmao All the jokes i hear feel like ::insert laugh track here:: MJ had some charisma atleast, lebron sounds like a cold fish reading a script "C'mon. Son. You can. Do....better? You have lots. A. Lot. Of po. Ten. Tial. Then tweety busts in " WASSS CRAKKINN YALLLS TWEETY IN DA HEEZY PASS ME DA ROCK YO! (OMG SPACE JAM GETS US!)
This actually looks garbage 😂
Warner Bros! WOW! 👌🏾
They decided to make a movie about them even though the suns literally killed their team
Wow IRON GIANT
Very cool
Йехова на гледната Space Jam Movie
Granny don't play😂😂
I'm fixing to run my mouth about this movie for the rest of my entire life.
I hope Guillermo (from jimmy Kimmel live) be in this one
Hmm. I wonder if old time TV Shows like The Cast of Friends, Big Bang Theory, Murphy Brown, etc and Recording Artists like Rod Stewart, Madonna, Kylie Minogue, etc are also gonna make special cameo appearances in Space Jam 2 as well?
This one will never beat the 90s version. They should of left this movie alone.
Ahhh my childhood!! Definitely watching this ❤️
Space jam a new legacy + willy wenderland the banana splits Luca Mitchell's vs  machines Goliath games
It's so similar to a bollywood movie "toonpur ka superhero"
I’m getting chills right now. I want to watch this movie
WHO IS GOING WATCH THIS GARBAGE?? SERIOUSLY
Gotta watch this for iron Giant
This will flop.  Most hated player in the league doing a sequel based on one of the most beloved players?  What a joke.
pls add big chungus
Technically this is the biggest crossover in history
*O L D G R A N D M A P L A Y S B A S K E T B A L L*
2:24 the goons from A Clockwork Orange were a really strange choice
I can already tell that I saw Space Ghost in Space Jam!
Space Jam nice
Toonpur ka superhero
And him chaseing the mystery machine
He gave kong a fist bump
The iron giant is playing basket ball
Did anyone notice the iron giant in the comercials
Just make shore tune squad is not down with 6 minutes to go cuz he will walk off the court lol facts
this isa just goooooooood
No Michael Jordan? I'll pass.
Bugs is a Struggling rapist and it's canon
Lola got nerfed real hard 💀💀
alleyoop ni wade to dati sa 2:10
Space jam 3 or 4 will release someday
the amout of lebron haters is surprised me, they are all everywhere lmao
good to see traditional hand draw 2D art back
2:23 Night King and Scooby Doo 😜
My dream team  Godzilla Mothra Rodan King Kong Optimus prime Bumblebee  Wade watts Art3mis Mandalorian
Toonpur ka super hero's movie copy
Spoilers: Lebron takes a knee in defiance of the Goon Squad until he realizes they are from China and apologizes profusely  Then the Toon Squad loses in 6
No no no no no, you idiots you did it wrong….. you made this look like a reboot/remake when this should have been a part 2 🤦‍♂️ I won’t be watching. Plus Lebron is no where near as iconic as Jordan
niceeeeee But want to see curry
this movie is so cool i love this movie
This looks ... not good
Alright, this original trailer looks a little better than the second trailer...
I am waiting this combo
LeBron is still holding on to blm and putting targets on the police honestly one of the worst role models.
No green screen anymore....now it is total CGI and other digital special effects. Oh well. Lets hope they bring back Michael Jordan, Bill Murry, and the fat guy with the glasses from Seinfeld. Will see this movie most likely on DVD, since it is for kids in theatres.
This trailer is missing the classic 90s voice-over and it feels more like it's an action-drama movie than a feel good action-comedy
Where is Tom and Jerry
💚💚💚
And Boboiboy is A cartoon to
Spongebob is A cartoon
Where is spongebobs
This will Flop he he he
I cannot wait to see this
That senior discount part tho 🤣🤣🤣 that was awesome Granny!
Next gen of michel loney
Why do i like this so much
Made in Chyna?!
How weird that WB who likes to change the characters from light skin to dark skin (for example: superheros). They have not put a light skinned basketball player in this movie to do the reverse.
I hope this is improvement from the last one i know the first or this will be bad
Not only is this a new movie, it introduces the Warner Brothers Multi verse. This means the monster verse could be official in this.
Why does it look like toon pur ka superhero hollywood version...?  No hatred to any of them though....
#hashtag
I wonder if lebron is just going to walk out when they're loosing and blame his teammates
We all know they had to animate him in act 2 cus he can't act to save his life
the lob from lola bunny looks like dwade
If they make a Kobe Bryant tribute in this movie I will cry
I become a furry now. thank's
I like the way they made this sequel the resemblance of Ready Player One and The Matrix
As an avid fan of the first one, this looks to be about as much of a hot dumpster fire as I expected it would.
This movie gonna Flop just like Lebron
DUDE ANOTHER MOVIES IS HERE OMG
No...Just No.....
Dude, I just realize, they took Lolas bazonkers because, if they used her old model in that realistic CGI, oh boy, oh buddy boy
oh no no BLM everywhere WTF i dont see one defund the police sign sad day for lachina james
1:05 What is this? AAAAAH!!! *blowing grunts* I'm a cartoon? Ehhhhhh, what's up doc?
This is one of the most expensive looking movie, I’ve ever scene, along with horror, and other people and things in media.
This is profoundly sad.
As much the technology today is great..the first one is the first one
Title song is much inspired by Tony Kakkar in repeatation 🤣🤣🤣
Now THIS is what I want to see in movie and show remakes!!! Best of BOTH worlds baby! 2d! 3D! Art from ALL decades! (Yeah the cg looks wonky of course but its WAY better than other stuff films have been giving us lately)
Well, ik what I’m gonna binge watch this summer, I’ll watch the first movie first, then jump into this one, time to get into the jam again!!! ✊
So how tf they forget how to play basketball from the first time
Wow this look shite
The Animaniacs better be in this...
Vegan version?
I'm so glad they included WNBA players in the new Monstars. Everybody recognizes them and they are very good at basketball. Definitely on the same level as AD, Dame and Klay. The most important thing in a movie is that its woke.
LeBrone de Stupid everybody ....NEVER!!!! watching this EVER!!!
Man, hate it when my son gets sucked my Falcon from avengers to an animated world were animations live and i get sucked into there and become an animation myself, and has to win a game of basketball with the looney tunes.  #relatable
Who came to this after seeing JC Chase Films' version? 👀
And they Endgame have the biggest crossover in film history.
Первую часть посмотрел лет в 5.. Майкл Джордан 💪🔥🚀
Evil General Rhodes
❤️❤️
Nah, it's not quite Ready Player One...  Remember that MetLife Superbowl ad from 2012 with all the Hanna-Barbera characters?  It's that, just loosely draped over a "Space Jam" plot.
When something has no substance they have to resort to flash.
I wonder who would be the star of the next generation
Tamil dudded please
love it how lola pose as d wade !!
Already looks better than the first lol
We all have nostalgia about space jam but I re watched it it's not amazing and u kind of feel like there going to f up its sequel
Uhhhh, WTF did I just see here?  No, just no.
I’ll take any entertainment after what we’ve been through 😤.  Yup, Disney+,  Prime, and others have been my friend.
2:09 I like the little d wade legacy there 🙏
Fantastic using many Ready Player One Easter-Eggs including the Iron Giant and King Kong. I would love to see a live-action/animated cosmic science fiction Duck Dodgers TV-Series, with Daffy Duck (Captain Duck Dodgers/Voice: Eric Bauza), Porky Pig (Eager Young Space Cadet/Voice: Bob Bergen), Marvin Martian (Martian Commander X-2/Voice: Eric Bauza), Queen Tyr'ahnee (Re-Voice: Tia Carrere) in this very CGI, where we get to witness the show take place at 2350 AD #LiveActionDuckDogers
So you can get Pepe LePew out of the movie but if you can get a cameo from A Clockwork Orange's Droogs, the word cynicism falls short of Warner Bros.
1:46 When the Disney and WB checks clear at the same time
This is so cringe, my god lol
🐰🏀
Michael in this role like joker,lebron james bigger personality,powerful athletism,powerful dunking and even father&son duo happen in 2024 lebron like thanos in avengers one man.
LeBron IS A COMMIE
Badass Bunny😍
Woowww they really had to Ruin Space Jam SMH
My space jam team will be me peridot from Steven universe eddy from Ed Edd n eddy rigby from regular show chicken from cow and chicken general skarr from billy and Mandy thrasher from robotomy moxy from the moxy show and brak from space ghost
all along i thought its kong!😂
This is lite!!!
Anybody who supports LeChina James is an absolute fool.
Here's the sad truth: this is the closest thing we'll be getting to another Roger Rabbit-type film, besides Ready Player One. Ironically though, I was lucky enough to view a reshowing of Roger Rabbit in theaters last month at a theater that showed old films.
So what's with the iron giant showing up in everything these days
A so-so Lola Bunny? No Pepe Le Pew? A police hater, who is at the same time China-shoes kisser? No way, there is no way I'm wasting time and money on this.
Could we got one more big trailer before the film comes out please?🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
"It is officially Canon that bugs was a struggling rapist all along"  - MeatCanyon  Watch videos before claim stuff Warner Bros, you stupid bastards
Everyone: *happiness wb noises from this trailer* Nostalgia Critic: WTH DOES THIS TRASH NEED A SEQUEL
2:13 I love the fact that King Kong is just chilling and watching the game like everyone else instead of rampaging through the crowd. 😂
Lebum can't act
They aren’t really rejects if they already have experience with basketball
MJ won the title the year Space Jam came out and look lebron just got eliminated from the 1st round 😂
🏀🏀🏀🏀
I'm excited to see the movie  BUT  It kind of reminds me of scary movie  vampire sucks and disaster movie and superhero movie but WB is a company for all these films but I want a movie all characters together
Al G will be lucky to be towel boy for the Tune Squad.
Lebrons acting could've been a little better
This is too cheesy and corny. Hollywood keeps on ruining good classic movies.
If this doesnt have michael sitting on a throne at any point of the movie i'll be so dissapointed
Can't wait to see it
1:58 Jaw Drop
Movies gonna be trash. You can tell it’s nothing like the first one and let’s just be real, Lebron shouldn’t have been in this movie. I suggest remaking it with Jordan. I mean we got them to fix sonic so why not fix this movie?
Is amazing
HOW IS EVERYONE HERE!!!! THIS IS AWESOME🤩🤩🤩 1:39
Boring.
Everyone is Here.......................BUT It's Space Jam.
I always thought that looney tunes back in action was a sequel to space jam I wonder where looney tunes back in action takes place
Oh, is this the love story about Lebron and Winnie the Pooh?
Space Jam version Where is my Shaun!
hope it had cuphead and peppa pig and blues clues and gumball and micky mouse and nickelodeon and cartoon network references in there?
Let's try that again shall we
they killed my childhood
Haters will say Suns were tougher than Goons
oh my buddha ...
Disney XD version.
Pleeeeeeasseeee be good
Devin Booker sends his regards Jokic would be great choice for third part!
Imagine how many green screens fir the first scene hahah
2:19 THis is my Favorite Word and I see the mask behind Tweetie
Lebron doing Space Jam? I bet it flops. :D
I can see it now. Toon Squad is down by 2 with 10 seconds left, they inbound the ball to lebron who gets away with a crab-dribble and passes to Bugs Bunny for three and the win. It’s gooooooddddd!!!! Bugs saves lebron’s legacy! Or so they think! Referee called a touch foul against the goon-squad before the shot which means that the three does not count. Lebron is sent to the line for 2 game-tying free throws instead. Lebron bricks the 1st and then misses the 2nd free-throw on purpose. Lebron gets his own rebound steps back for 3 and air balls the final shot!!!
1:02
its supposed to be for kids ppl chilllllll
will audrey 11 from little shop of horrors 1986 make an apperence?
It would be cool if like in the first space jam instead of bill Murray...you have Michael Jordan come down and save LeBron and the tune squad from defeat because LeBron can NO LONGER carry a team on his back anymore and win a Championship, or first round in the playoffs 😂 Thanks to BOOKER and the Suns
Space Jam a New Legacy - Trailer 2
Hopefully LaBron does better in this movie than he did in NBA playoffs for the Lakers
The previous theme song was much better. This movie looks cool though, I will sure watch it.
i wish there were three space jam movies. First with Jordan,second Kobe and third James.
This doesn’t look good
I am so excited for this movie! it is going to be awesome!
Can you wait the unikitty
now this is why LBJ looks uninterested in the game earlier, he got a son to save.
So here’s the PLOT   LeBron James loses the first round to the Suns... gets sent to Looney Tunes land 🏀 BOOM!
Acting is a lot more difficult than trying to fool a ref.  This movie is gonna flop.
Why is Lebron a cartoon...
This movie looks stupid. I’m gonna watch it
2:33
Around the beginning it reminded me of some parts of Saints Row 3.
I laughed when I saw Lola Bunny in her burka.
man, hollywood is really running out of ideas.
Make a lego movie 3
bet animaniacs are in this
anyone remember the space jam game on ps1 Lls
Hahaha
I'm usually critical of sequels/reboots, but this genuinely looks really good. I can't wait to watch it.
But the real question everyone is asking in this trailer, Where is godzilla?
I see what everyone means by Ready Player One. But let's not forget Who Framed Roger rabbit, Wreck it Ralph and Avengers Endgame
Not a good actor but hey he's living his dream so that's all that matters
They could of at least gave Lola some knees because in this version they just don't look right...that's the only thing they just needed to do before it's release just like how they fixed up sonic.
Ready Basketball Player
Space jam 1 > Space Jam 2.  MJ > Lebron
Let's hope there's no white man with a badge in the movie cause damn.
It's the iron giant from ready player one
Space Jam was great because it didnt try as hard as this. Also, Michael Jordan. (No hate on the great player that is Lebron James though)
If you make a sequel, make it a good one
At 2:23, Behind the Clockwork Orange you can see The Joker (Joquin Phoenix) behind them for a split second, you have to zoom in. He is behind I believe his name is Alex for a second, you can see the makeup, the green hair and the iconic red stripe that goes down both of his eyes. (I hope that’s him.)
OMG space jam is back even looney tunes ❤️❤️
Michael Jordan gonna make an appearance? That would be cool.
Welcome to Warner Brothers Discovery!!!!
will audrey 2 from little shop 1986 be in this movie? and it's the movies 35th aniversery!
He had to be black 😂
I wonder if this movie will "flop" too.😂🤣😅
Granny is badass
1:39-1:40 The Mystery Machine from Scooby doo, The Iron Giant, One of the dragon from GOT. 1:41-1:43 The flintstones, Captain Cave man, Yoogie bear and booboo, The Yetis from Small foot, the Bipedal shark who’s name I can’t remember and King Kong.
1:04 ♥️ the brown ☁️ shape
Wet FDA drew he he b e E he he he he FDA sad FDA FFs the f de ft RSS e FDA tv
Yeah space jam is back I can not wait to see this movie Space Jam yeah so excited for 😍😍👌👌❤❤
Nerfed Lola...
try watching this while your high
Me and bill Murray : the goat duo
porridge .
lmao wha
Seems Warner didn't forget about the iron giant
I think it will be good I But I also think it’s just way to much
Meh
omg this is soooo cooool i cant wait to watch it
Guys dont forget that bugs bunny is a rapist in cannon and this isnt a joke im being serious
2d team, make her flat with a bit wide on the hip by comparison to rest of form, 3d team, we gonna still give her curves but make it more subtle than the original was.
I wish they put Dunkmaster darius in this
I remember when Pete was sending Lebron to tune world and meet bugs bunny.
Uh... It's gonna be so bad.
space jam 1: does the most ambious collab in 1996 infinity war: beats that warner bros with a sequal ready: you dare oppose me mortal
I'm wondering why they didn't pick Kobe Bryant to be the star? LOL
It's officially canon that bugs bunny is a struggling rapist.
NETS in 4
I'm just waiting for the CCP subtleties to happen.
Not gonna see that movie
Nah can’t watch this sellout... 😪
1:43 Welcome to the 7 GRAND JAM
this is just ready player one but better they threw kong in theree???
#suckitwarnerbrothers
omg looks like a dumpster fire

Don't you just hate it when your mansion's elevator leads to a horrible HR department that turns your life into a video game slash cartoon basketball game?
yeah…it’s a no for me..
1:46 LMFAO Pennywise is their point guard
chainlink and hive 0:26
where's Mike., 😥
LETS GOO SPEEDYY
It doesn’t take a wall to make Lebron hit the floor and see tweety...it just takes a poke to the eye
I came here for Lola but since she has nothing to show anymore i can settle for the iron Giant. That was a nice surprise tbh
I love seeing the animaniacs here!
He wants to be Michael Jordan so bad  Lebron James is the biggest cry baby in the nba
The Goon Squad is much worst than the Monstars, right?
Labron James is a clown fiesta
Would it be a better movie if the Lannisters from Game of Throne were the villains ?
ill have to read this movies review before I really decide to watch
toonpur ka superrhero 🤣🤣🤣
haha this is going to flop more than LeBron does!
1:41 Welcome to           Y a b b a  D a b b a  D o o ! The Space Jam!
If you thought that was epic, go see Warner Animation Group and Cartoon Network's first ever Ben 10 theatrical movie, Ben 10 x Magia Record: Rise of the Xerge releasing to theaters and HBO Max SEPTEMBER 10, 2021! Also, what are y'all expecting from LeBron James before you watch Space Jam: A New Legacy?
I'm gonna wait for this to realese on flixtor
So lame, Lebron is so desperately trying to be MJ that's it's just kinda sad at this point dude dunks on himself MJ doesn't even need to say anything lol
Hahaha awesome, thats cool, yeah.... cool yeah.....yeah mmm.... I DONT REMEMBER KICKING A BASKETBALL IN THE GAME!!!!
Feel like he’s gonna make one 3-pointer for then go down and grab his knee five minutes into the game.
Okay I am hyped
I can say that LeBron is a better actor than MJ. In the og MJ was an awful actor 😂 tbf to MJ having your first acting gig to a green screen must be pretty tough!
if you a monsterverse fan pause your screen on 2:14
Are we not going to talk about IT in the background in 1:45
So wants to be the goat ..wears the goats number wears the goats logo in all star game .now wants a movie like the goat....lachina crybaby james is not the goat
King k 1:44
1:11 ne what's up doc 🐇🐰
0:12  do me
"Space Jam: A New Legacy" is a stand-alone sequel, not a direct sequel.
F*ck this movie.
Goon squad literally got 3 players bruh
Creativity in 2021: Let's marry all existing characters! yay!
space jam meets ready player one with a touch of Scoob= an excuse for more hannah barbera related universe movies in the future.
I wouldn't be surprised if Sesame Street is included in the film and Serververse as well (technically, WarnerMedia doesn't really fully own it, but it airs on HBO and HBO Max now).
Daammmnnn!!! That Grandma got some moves
Where is MJ?
That just looks trash.... sometimes things just need to be left alone....but flog that dead horse for what $$$$ you can...
D..DON CHEADLE???
This comes out on my brithday
Lesson #1: Never underestimate old people. Including Granny in the end
This is going to be one awsome sequel.
Are we just not gonna talk about how Drogon from Game of Thrones was in the trailer?
This trailer should’ve been in Tom and Jerry 2021 Blu-ray and DVD
LAME
We're very excited for this one ! ❣️❣️
Space Jam 2 looks like it might just be the “TRUE”greatest crossover of all time (looking at you, Endgame)
Ok I'm speechless. All I'm gonna say is I have goosebumps already
This is my most anticipated movie of 2021
Shows characters from Game of Thrones and Clockwork Orange. Shows with actual depictions of rape.  But cartoon skunk bad.
dang it tony you gave rhody control of space
If only Michael Jordan would see this now?
Damn they got every movie there but Pacific rim.
I honestly don't think this will be anything more than nostalgia bait.
straight to streaming, not gonna wast $20 on this
this looks kind of dissapointing i dont remember them ever animating michael in space jam takes away from the natural acting less acting more animation = crappier cheaper movie
Dang Granny got some skills
Whatching movies
This sucks they ruined this
My one nitpick: It's TOON world, not TUNE world! Edit: Oh, I get it. Looney TUNES. ...I retract my previous statement.
This movie's going to have a lot of pop culture references like games and movies
If LeBron has 2 twins YoungBron and HeatBron at the finale basketball THAT WOULD BE EPIC
WHY * IS * THIS * NOT * 2D * ?
I wonder if cypress hill ,coolio method man where be in the soundtrack
Que pongan a piolín mounstro (tweety mr hyde)😀
It's obviously not gonna be as good as the first one but i guess respect the effort
These players and many players are unique and great ^^

I miss the original one but if you wanna see a new legacy and have fun you have to forget the original.
Something tells me this movie is gonna do horribly...
The picayune conifer postnatally untidy because route globally miss given a abject department. amused, glossy attraction
This should collaborate with Fortnite. Imagine a Fortnite X Space jam skin pack
Why did they changed it tune squad i though its toon squad
Man this is going to be one garbage 90 minute commercial.
Way to step in someone shadow🤣 you’ll never be Jordan.. this movie was a bad idea!
I'm only a little disappointed they aren't using the lola from the looney tunes show
Who’s here from fortnitexnba?
Looney tunes go back to 2D animation  after half time Please turn them to 2D animation
OH MY GOD! DON CHEADLE IS IN THE MOVIE!!! Sorry about that, I just love Marvel so much.
Computer-animated Looney Tunes characters?  Now, that's more like it!
The way this movie can be like the first one is if Michael Jordan is like the new bill Murray
Dude the old one graphics cartoon world everything far better looking this is blaw
1:24 So it's ok for them to have guns again?
Cant wait to see it. Way to go Lebron. Also the the Lakers will be the lowest seed #7 to win the NBA Finals!!!
Michael be like:Stop It! Get some help!!
Why? who is this for?
The hushed railway commercially attempt because book happily trip minus a alcoholic head. zippy, six bomb
I don't know about you but the 2D animation in this isn't as Fluid as the 1st space jam. it's really damn quality, for a TV special. but for a big budget movie it's rather choppy and isn't very pleasing to look at in motion, The character designs doesn't help either as especially lola looks like a greased up toy and not a rabbit 2D and 3D , i understand they're AI versions of the looney tunes cast. but it's still not an excuse to make otherwise average at best animation for a movie, it should've been way smoother than the first.   I'm just putting my take on the animation from the trailer maybe the final film will look better but i don't know.
This movie is very ridiculous with a plot line saving some kid who has an attitude and what's with the religional references to King James just cuz he plays basketball doesn't make him a king especially with this whole granny thing I find it very degrading to hold people seems almost like a slap in the face saying that old people are snippy and rude
Should be good since Lebron is good at "acting" on the court.
Nope
Where's james. JAmes Corden
I don't think Tony Stark is going to be happy that Jim Rhodes went rogue...
This looks horrible... no thanks.
Jordan > LeChina
I don't watch movie trailers anymore. They just give away to much sometimes. Like the new terminator didn't watch the trailer. All I'm gonna say is I will watch the new one, I was child when the 1st one came out so it better be good. I hope kids like it, actually that's all that matters. If the kids like it then it's good.
Wtf happened to lola
2021 kids will be all a basketball player
Capitalism is the most innovative economic system
This movie will make you laugh and enjoy while watching it and might post on social media that you liked the movie but forget all about it on the next day that you watched the movie. I'm not hating the movie itself but damn I am 100% sure that this movie is pretty forgettable.
Is y’all going to ignore the fact that Pepe LePew ain’t in the movie
And I thought family guy had the most cameos guess that crown goes to space jam now
Rocket fuel by DJ Shadow
when Space Jam: A New Legacy – Trailer 2 comes?! will see Marvin and Penelope in the TuneSquad team in the Movie?!
Is MJ gonna have a cameo in this movie??
1:58 My Reaction to Dracula, Frankeinsteina nd others monsters (Except Mavis, i guess) turns into the humans from Hotel Transylvania 4!
It honestly doesn’t look bad, like we all had the highest expectations and it looks pretty dope. Better than I expected tbh, would be perfect if there was an MJ cameo too
goated
What is this?! Of course they have to bring high technology bs in a sports movie.. Where the hell are the monsters??? The opposite team looks terrible, water, fire, really???? At least with monsters they were strong big and mean.  Did Bugs just went real life?? Are you kidding me?  I knew they would f it up. Just like they did with Jumanji.
movie name?
It feels like smash brothers the movie
I hope mortal kombat makes an appearance in this movie.
Take lebron out and put Micheal Jordan
Am I the only one bothered it doesn't follow the original film? Like at all? Like now the looney tunes live in some digital space as opposed to already existing in our real world? Almost like they tried too hard to make everything make sense when it doesn't really need to be.
Wow, that's an interesting fusion of mixed media on many levels. Live action, 2-D, and 3-D plus some good humor tossed in. I'm getting some _Ready Player One_ vibes with all of the references shoved in all at once but that's just nitpicky. Choice in music is a little... meh... though when the actual movie is released then we can judge it. Bravo on pulling this out of production hell. It's been shelved almost as long as the remake of _Spawn_ (1997).
Крутяк!! С первой конечно же не сравнится, да и не надо этой х..нёй заниматься ,надо просто смотреть ))))    Правда будет только через 2 месяца )
Lebron is actually a decent actor 😯
Welcome to the Space Jam🏀
"Michael Jordan is in the movie". "But not in the way you'd expect it" - Don Cheadle
Wouldn't mind if the metaverse looked something like this..
#restorethesnyderverse
Plot Twist: MJ is LeBron's father
we don't want space jam a new legacy to be bad like scoob and tom and jerry the movie and we don't want this film to get the razzie awards
I was excited about this movie until Lebron James opened his mouth and showed what a racist he is
"You're never let me just do me"  You guys understand why I did that ha 😜😜😜
I still can’t get over LeBron James saying, “What in the Matrix hell is this?” xD
Even in movies LeBron can’t touch Mike.
Bring it On.
But.i got a question Warner Bros why is daffy whereing a shirt t_shirt and have a tie but herd daffy a PE so things like that and for that all the other tunes squad team but he will change so I guess that no problem im mean they show me every pitcher daffy where a same shirt but yeah now I call it a that all folks .
That is hands down the cringiest thing I've ever seen. Holy shit.
Makes sense that we see Jabber Jaw, it IS 2021
I wonder if *Michael Jordan* would see the sequel, it's like Infinity War and Endgame But Basketball!!!
If Disney tried to make such crossover
Nah... doesnt sound right- not like the first space jam... wont mind watching the old one again 😁
WB LOST their damn Minds
This looks like BULL CRAP
Space jam with Michael Jordan what is way better than the trailer to this piece of trash

malcom d lee,don cheadle,lebron james and bugs bunny please make cameos of cartoon network and adult swim characters in space jam a new leagcy please they now owned by WB
"That shit stank don't it!!?"
Why does every new movie always remix an old song and puts like a dubstep sound on it. It kills the old one imo. 1:14 example
Should have had kobe or Kevin Durant 😭🤦🏾‍♂️
Will he be meeting Winnie the Pooh as usual.
Klay as Wet Fire is a dope ass character concept!
I pray characters from Happy Feet, Legends of the Guardians, The Lego Movies and Storks appear!
I think they meant: Ready Player 2 Trailer
What happened to Michael Jordan

Very much appreciated if they bring back Pepe Le Pew and MJ. Im sure the Oscar will choose Lebron for Best actor in a drama.
That's simular to ralph breaks the internet.
Eh...whats up Doc!
Am I seeing this or all the movies in one basketball court like theres pennywise,and I think theres men in black there too.
Mr China. Hard pass.
It will be the greatest scene of all time  If they have Michael Jordan Come Out To Help Lebron & Tune Squad. & the original “SpaceJam” song starts playing while he walks out
Looks shit
I love  LeBron  James

i’m still upset that pepe le pew won’t be in here but i’m still hyped for this movie
Michael Jordan Space Jam is this the best one of all time Brown James can compete with him Jesus amen God Bless America Mars and back
cant wait to see it
DAMN if I was LeBron I would be like I'm out  2:23
List of most popular movies featuring the iron giant 1: Space Jam: A New Legacy 2: Ready Player One 999: The Iron Giant
Love the movie and can’t wait for the song to come out
Anyone else in the starring role besides racist lebron james, and I would watch it.
So aparently everyone in the known omiverse is at this basketball game
BRING BACK MY PEPE LE PEW!!!
"What in the Matrix Hell?"...good question.
Original Space Jam is good enough for me......if LeBronda was more humble, less ignorant, cared about "character" and his name was Michael Jordan then I'd watch it
A Space Jam Sequel Also Known As Space Jam 2 A New Legacy Is Coming To Theaters And HBO Max July 16th 2021
Cringe👎
FRED FLINTSTONE MAHNN OHH COME ONNN !!
the tralir never gets old
this is my favriote movie that is coming out
Flop
When the soundtrack is better than the movie.  Also. We just had Ready Player One.. That’s all the King Kong, Iron Giant, Warner Bros junk I needed.
Michael Jordan, now that man is an inspiration to all kids. LeBron on the other hand is an entitled man child that is a stain on his profession. Hard pass
not even gonna lie...i was laughing most of the time.
WOW 23k dislikes shows people arent that dumb. Nice stats!
Man I'm in my late 20s, Married, have a daughter and I still find Lola Bunny hot.. What even is this..
SOULLESS
Bugs bunny could solve that in 6 minutes
There was a lot of cool stuff like flingstones,king kong, and alot more but I going crazy with hype when bugs bunny said,"eh whats up doc?" I still don't think this will top the first one but if Micheal Jordan shows up at the end or something than ill be happy.
aaaaaaaand none of the tunes remember doing this before....would have been a sweet reference, am gonna see it but i feel like this is a "ready player one" situation where they just pack in as many classic and beloved characters as possible into the audience just for nostalgea....am gonna watch this because i saw the first one on release...and thats all there is to it
Yes, this is for sure the best animated movie!!!😁👍👍👍
What  the frick happend to lola?!?!?!?!?!
Sadly, this piece of garbage will still make bank, because the bar is set that low for people nowadays. Talk about a race to the bottom.
July movies and TV shows that I'll watch are black widow that got more than 3 trailers, space jam 2 that got a trailer and titans s3 that didn't get a trailer
Im sooooooo happy 😙😙😙😙💪💪💪💪
اسم الفلم
Warner bros is cool
This is so sad ....
Hate to break it to you LeBron but you will never be as good as Michael Jordan, he has more talent in his pinky then your whole body which is pretty sad. Your movie sucks, the original Spacejam will always be better then this garbage but at the same time its only garbage because your in it. Michael Jordan will always be better then you!! Accept it.
Are they going to to be hopping into the legoverse since it is made by warner bros because it would be cool to see them in the movie
Warner Bros. IPs that we’re not shown  1. Mars Attacks 2. Happy Feet 3. The Ant Bully 4. Cats And Dogs 5.Detective Pikachu 6. Osmosis Jones 7. The Lego Movie 8. The Lord Of The Rings 9. Mortal Kombat  10. Tom And Jerry 11. The Suicide Squad 12. Cartoon Network Characters  That’s So Far The Movies I Haven’t Seen In The Trailer I Hope Warner Bros Does Show Them In The Actual Movie When It Release But I Wanted To Point That Out Just In Case You Was Wondering.
Warner brothers your the best movie company ever how do you come up with these good movies
The world has turned so gay 😞
Trash James. Propaganda pandering piece of shit. As good as thos looks I refuse to watch it because he is in it. I would prefer Michael Jordan to replace him.
If big chungus isnt in this, im mad.
Space jam>other cartoons
When it tanks, LeBronda will cry racism.
Okay, I should see this on HBO Max, TOTALLY!
Never forget.  Bugs bunny: Looking like a double wide surprise... *breaths deeply* GOOOOOD DAAAAAAAAAMN
Wooooaaahh!!! Can't wait this movie 🔥🔥🔥
3:22 Anyone else noticed Alex Delarge and his gang?
This is the best movie EVER
1996 lola bunny Vs 2021 lola bunny.
Monstars and goon squad in space jam and space jam a new legacy
Wow the visual and special effects are damn!
Boa noite congrats space Jam vai l James NBA Los Angeles Lakers BOM 👌🏿💪🏿🇺🇸
"we need to assemble an elite team"- LeGM 2021. Gave my goosebumps
Well, The Lego Movies that Legos are my favorite and Space Jam with Looney Tunes: Back in Action that the Tune Squad vs. The Monstars and The Goon Squad in high Basketball game courts are perfect start for the Warner Bros. Marathon. Also it will feature classic Films, Happy Feet films, Cats & Dogs and many more. This will be so awesome, it will make you so looney and so epic.
Russian movie lookalike new movie dunno what called but like fiction sport fantasy movie
Kobe aint dead! We never die! - Meelis Leming , my fcking philosophy!
After his Twitter remarks I'm not supporting lebron at all!
Clearly nerfed Lola bunny lol
LEGEND
idk how i feel about tweeties voice actor but maybe cause he only talked for half a sec.
This is actually kinda hype
i only wait to see again Marvin the martian with the design of his canceled live action design
Fuck lebron James
Sam: *Stops Shooting* 1:26 - 1:29
I wonder if Tom and Jerry, Tex Avery and other MGM Cartoon characters will be as the Easter egg cameos in Space Jam 2.
Another non original piece of regergitated crap
NBA version of ready player one
I just realized bugs was wearing the original Tune Squad jersey while he was turning 3D
Cringe
Am hella exited bro this is going to be dope
OMG Ive never been so excited this just brings me back to my childhood🥰🥰🥰🥰
not barkely?
I so can’t wait to see Space Jam A New Legacy later this year
Just imagine if Kobe was in this movie :'( <3
Space Jam 2: A New Legacy July 16😍😍😍
It’s basically Ready Player One meets WB.
If you pause at 2:14 you can see king kong at the right
Drogon!
Why was King Kong there or I mean kong there
Wow I bet that guy has a lot of police training, he should be an advisor or something
Where are the autobots?
#RestoreTheSnyderverse

What are the chances of Mickey Mouse cameo.

That’s one big pile of Shit
Welcome to the space jam
This is dumber than the original. Wtf isn't this straight to dvd? Yuck 🤢
O pior inimigo DC não é Darkseid, é Warner Studio
Cool!😍
This trailer can make things look like a mix between a cash grab and a Warner Bros.-themed acid trip on steroids.
Aburrido y con inclusión forzada zzzz
*Top 10 Anime Crossovers*
1:37 Bugs Bunny finds the Twilight Bracelet  (OG anime fans will understand)
0:33 is the best scene in the trailer.
Might be the single greatest advert for hbomax ever! The other place has some big licences but look at the amount and variety just in one 2min trailer
Damn. Last thing we needed.. More shitty cgi
soulless reboot of old franchise with no regard what makes the old version so good number 564328 ... now with even more references of the WB Franchises so people will finally like the product
All the cartoon charm is clouded by the mundane CGI.
👍👍👍
Lebron: am i a cartoon Me: no your lebron James
I sure hope Tom and jerry emmet top cat Benny brain Choo Choo fancy fancy and spook yakko wakko and dot junior Migo fleegle beagle drooper and snorky will be in space jam 2
Better that Michael Jordan’s  VERSION
Lmao why was drogon from game of thrones there
Gramma got moves
The “clockwork orange” part is the best!!!! “Your next”!!!!!!
Why Jeff Bergman is the voice of Bugs Bunny in this movie?

This looks epic
1:12 WHATS UP DOC
I love this franchise. It's the best.
looks Good
I’m not seeing this. Honestly, surprised the comments are still on. I want my children to actually respect authority. Also, serious Ready Player One vibe and we saw how that worked.

Fun fact:Lola bunny Will b voiced by singer/actor Zendaya. Speedy Gonzales will b voiced by comedian Gabriel "fluffy" Iglesias. I searched the cast on Google, its real😶💥, search if u don't believe me.
Wow wow wow
YOU'RE NEXT. ACCOUNTABILITY
Oh dang! Don Cheadle kidnaps his kid for some games! Sounds more like an EDP445 things!
This movie needs to never see the light of day.
Warner, give Lola her old design back, seriously, everyone is triggered about the changes, just change her back for everyone

#RestoreTheSnyderVerse much ❤️
Wonderful trailer I'm exicted and hype now for 16 july
meh
Now we got a new debate. Who does a better Space Jam? Lebron or MJ?...
Can you please add Hugo the Abominable Snowman into the tune squad?
They gonna make a game? Looks dope!
#RestoretheSnyderVerse or else #LetsBoycottWarnerBros
this trailer feels diferent after the lebron james and cop incident
Pete, send this clown to the rejects! 🤡 😂😂
Can wait to see big chungus in the big screen’s
Get woke go broke.
If we dont see a Green Loontern reference, we should shame WB.
I refuse now to take the grandkids to this. LEBRON needs to learn that his opinion is NOT NEEDED!
I hope we'll hear Cypress Hill, Coolio, Busta Rhymes and Methodman again.
The movie we don't deserve.
Usual terrible casting from WB.
Hey HBO  I Found Drogon Now We Can Make GAME OF THRONES Season 09............
Your next. You racist haha
I love space jam it is my fav movie!!!!!!!
Bill S. Preston and Theodore Logan, Spock, The Rock, Doc Ock, and Hulk Hogan
Adventure time Princess Lumpy Space Princess
They better add Big Chungus here
Space jam 1 seems better
Woketard shit
I straight up don't want to see this
This looks horrible
Monstars were actual useless cartoon aliens mixed with great basketball players from earth, perfectly fused together into a dangerous opponents that knew how to play actual BASKETBALL... having wings for arms and being an "element" is just a horrible idea, someone should lose their job... or just don't call it Space Jam.
"EH.. Whats up doc??"
Didn't even know they were making a new Tron Movie... interesting approach switch the game to B-ball and adding the looney toons.
The best crossover doesnt exi-
Oh look. A movie that’s using what Ready Player One did first. I got a great idea......either this movie will bomb horribly by brutally honest reviewers or it might be a hidden gem that rarely happens in the history movie industry. I can be wrong, but we will all find out sooner or later.
ppl be commenting abt Bron's deleted tweet but dont talk abt the 2 tweets he put out explaining himself smdh
Michael Jordan is such an innovator its crazy
Tom And Jerry Tom Cat Jerry Mouse Spike
Don't judge the elders people. 2:26
Terrible
2:28 abuelita truco 😎👌
1:26 well he did shoot the ball 🤣🤣
MJ beat the monstars with the fippin' tune squad, LeBron has to godforsaken Iron Giant on his team!
So we not gonna talk about how they made Lola not hot anymore?
who else is mad lola bunny isnt as sexy as before
Just here to downvote this crap. Sincerely,  human born in 90s
Coming back to see this for the first time since watching it a bunch of times Day 1...  Yeah. I'm still hyped for this.
I'll only be happy as long as The Warner siblings get a special cameo and some lines
what about cartoon network propeties? you know, foster's home for imaginary friends, ed, edd and eddy, totally spies, cow and chicken, johnny bravo, codename: kids next door, courage the cowardly dog, i am weasel, the grim adventures of billy and mandy, the original ben 10, the life and times of juniper lee, camp lazlo, my gym partner's a monkey, squirrel boy, time squad, samurai jack, sheep in the big city, hi hi puffy ami yumi, the adventures of eliot kid, secret saturdays, class of 3000, team galaxy, dexter's laboratory, mike, lu and og, whatever happened to robot jones, chowder, the marvelous misadventures of flapjack, even the original powerpuff girls don't make at least one single cameo appearance! all these characters didn't make any cameo appearances! cartoon network is a waner bros. property too, you know! let them make cameos! let them make cameos! let them make cameos!  Other warner bros. animation and cartoon network-related propeties that I want to see in the movie: hamtaro, winx club, dragon ball z, pokémon, yu-gi-oh!, the original teen titans, static shock, xaolin showdown, mucha lucha, justice league, jackie chan adventures, tiny toon adventures, freakazoid, the rest of the animaniacs cast, batman beyond, the zeta project, tom and jerry, pink panther, droopy, screwball squirrel, barney bear, george and junior, red hot riding hood and the wolf, histeria, detention, megas xlr, baby looney tunes, loonatics unleashed, generator rex, and of course, sym-bionic titan.  Note: In case they want to add cameos from The Powerpuff Girls and Ben 10 characters, they better animate them in their respectful classic designs from the original animated series (by the way, if they want to add cameos from other cartoon network classic shows, those characters better appear in their classic designs from the original animated series, capiche?), due to the fact that their rebooted versions stink (I hate to admit that thing with the reboots, but unfortunately it's true).  P.S.: Ok, i know some of these shows aren't exactly cartoon network or warner bros. animation-related propeties, but what can i say? i love all these shows, they were all part of my childhood, and honestly, i got a serious passion for them, especially foster's.
Lebron is the most hated athlete in the United States right now
I’m low-key excited cause I absolutely loved Space Jam but at same this is modern whereas Space Jam was simple as😭
#restorethesynderverse
This looks SOOOOOO much worse than I could have ever imagined. I'm still in awe this is such garbage. Gonna get the Bluray for the original now.
I Hope Scorpion and Sub-Zero should have cameos in Space Jam 2 as well especially the other Mortal Kombat Characters
Forget it! I was actually going to look forward to A New Legacy, and now what LeBron did is not right! I love Looney Tunes and other Warner Bros. cartoon characters with the same feeling as i love Mickey Mouse and Disney characters and princesses! And plus those R-rated characters from It & Clockwork Orange, i wasn't interested in those 2! Thanks a lot LeBron! #BoycottANewLegacy!  P.S. It also has James Rhodes (a.k.a. War Machine)! Marvel is always the best and so does DC!
Can you at least #ReleaseTheAyerCut and #RestoreTheSnyderUniverse? That would be the best thing you could do at these difficult times...
Introducing..The Goon Squad - The Brow, Chronos, White Mamba, Arachnneka, and Wet/Fire
No.
Boycott this movie and Lebron!
Am I the only one who find Lebron cartoonified weird? I'd rather it be the same as the original where it's a real life actor inside a cartoon world because it's more hilarious like when Bugs kissed Jordan, etc. back then.
Let’s boycott this garbage.
The guy with the beard should try basketball he’s pretty good
Hey witches/ pigs, looks like LeBron is out threatening someone. For "accountability", from you type?? That's disgustingly hilarious (short story witches/ pigs). It ain't no wonder that his pal/ the player died in the helicopter, thinking he can do whatever the fuck he wanted. Took his dam child down with him and all. (witches; short story pigs)
I wish if kobe was here😥
Compared Looney Tunes Evolution Movie:  2D = Space Jam 1996 3D = Looney Tunes Back In Action 2D, 3D, 4D = Space Jam: A New Legacy   XD
Lebron defs going to win the nba championship 2021... this movie is trash..
Scooby van got Crushed by a "Foot"
Who saw Pennywise in 1:46 in the background event thought this is a kids film ?
AntiSexy Bunny 🤦‍♂️
Lmao and that's the end of Woke Brothers
I Saw kong
boycott ?
It had been almost 25 yrs to wait Space Jam 2. But now, Space Jam is back. Yes!😃🏀

Tune squad vs goon squad
Only showed up here to encourage people to NOT support LeChina James and his racist attitude.  I will be happy watching this movie flop.
Internet reacts to 2021 trailers: It spoils everything also the internet in 2021: I'm gonna go watch it anyway what the trailers actually spoil:                Nothing
This movie wont be as popular because of his tweet. What a moron.
Yo. A mi megusto
Omg
🏀 🙌
Never watching another WB movie again if this goes through. Lebron is a coward
Is LeBron gonna send all the cartoon characters after a cop?
#YOURENEXT
BOYCOTT LEBRON
First Godzilla vs Kong.   Now THIS?!?
This movie is Next...one I'm gonna skip.
Hanna Barbera's Godzilla should be in this movie.
1:23 Does Willy realize that Road Runner it's right next to him right?
This movie will "NOT NEXT" since  I only put my money on people who respect our police and our nation.  So long W.B.. I will never pay for to see your products...BOYCOTT W.B.
Skip.
why the fuck did they go with this terrible looking cgi instead of more classical designs?!
Add Space Jam: A New Legacy to the list of things I am no longer interested in...    LeBron James is engaging in Politics and endangering the poor who depend on the stability provided by the police, just to walk to the grocery store and back.  LeBron has his own entourage and bodyguards everywhere he goes, but wants to deny the poor any police.  The police are going to leave and it will be a wild west landscape.  And LeBron will still not accept the damage he is doing.
THIS MOVIE NEEDS TO HURRY UP
This film is like Ready Player One meets Who Framed Roger Rabbit meets Jumanji...
Movie studio hires a billionaire pro basketball racist, cop hater, who is partnered with communist dictators that enslave their opponents. Is this the perfect Hollywood match-up?
Imagine Kobe being part of the movie
A movie about a kid getting blackmailed, but in order to get him back they have to play a game of basketball? Just what I needed in my life
This looks completely ridiculous... And I say that in the best of ways. I honestly never thought they would remake Space Jam, and I definitely never thought they would make it look this entertaining.  I'm in, let's do this.  Random side note: Prepare yourselves for a new wave of Lola 'fan art'.
Wow. this is trash
You couldn't pay me $1000 dollars to see this movie! Lebron will never have the class that Michael Jordan had! Him posting that tweet about the cop is completely unacceptable. He needs to do a ride along to actually see what police have to do  go through everyday!  The policeman saved a woman's life in of story!!!! Stick what your good at putting a ball in a hoop! PS move to your friends in China since America is so evil sir!
1:27 wait 🤔
DONT BRING LEBRON HERE HE IS NOTHING TO JORDAN
Good luck with this turd, LeRacist.
You're Next.....
Godzilla maybe in next to kong maybe somewhere is he aslo tom and jerry arent even do they got there movie.
Is this the space jam movie were LeBron makes death threats to the police?
2:24 they was a coolest grandma so we want that one
Ah, what should we play LEBRON JAMES to get his son back? hmmmmmmmmmm.... how about... BASKERBALL?
trash, remember when Warner Bros made good movies?
Lebron is a Michael wannabe
One word, Travel.
Dogecoin to the moon buy the dip
lol Goon Squad... they look like a bunch of unmenacing wussies... The Monst⋆rs would kick their asses big time...
LeBron is a Chinese hack and America hater despite making millions off the free market system.  Don't watch this crap.
Lebron: "You're Next" Goon Squad: "Bro...She had a Knife." Lebron: Deletes Tweetie Bird.
It's interesting
After that bad Tweet comment. I won’t be surprised if the movie doesn’t go far.
no hate but the first movie was with michael jordan why lebron james tho     edit: never mind i notice that michael jordan didn't agree to be in the 2nd movie
I refuse to watch this movie for starring an open, anti-white racist.
Boycotting
I just came here to say that I look forward to ignoring this movie because of the racist and ignorant jackass that’s starring in it.

LeBron's cartoon image is like LaMarcus Aldridge✌🤣
Screw Lebron. He is a race baiter spreading hate by promoting false rhetoric against law enforcement. Should of made this movie years ago with Kobe or Wade.
Si no está Pepe lee pow mejor no lo veré
I prefer the original Space Jam over this. Michael >>>> LeBron
I'm excited for this
Lebron James can't be like Michael Jordan..i love the first space jam... Michael Jordan 23 forever..
Ready player one: WB cartoon edition
No skunk, but somehow clockwork orange droogs are ok?  Wtf?
They nerf lola hard but rule34 will make her better
Looks kinda trashy
You're Next
NEXT
lol this movie looks like trash
If you have any ounce of respect for police officers who follow proper procedures and put their lives on the line for you, then do not support this movie.
I will not support a movie staring a racist cop hating billionaire. WB should condemn his comments.
I have zero interest watching anything with LeBron James now after he doxxed a police officer who saved a life.
Not watching any movie that stars a person (LeBron James) that calls for the mob to kill. This man has gone to far and should at the very least be suspended from playing his little GAME that he gets PAID to PLAY.
Lebron should hang this acting thing up, he's really terrible.
WHERE MARVIN ?
WHOA ! AWSOME !
Imagine your kid was the woman in pink LeBron. Would that officer be "NEXT" then?  Don't support companies who make stupid people famous.
0/10 the bunny girl isn't hot enough
2
Well come on you corporations who have become the moral police. Cancel lebron for putting a policemans life in danger because he saved someone's life. Just because he's a black Democrat it shouldn't matter should it?
I can't wait for *Big Chungus.*
1https://youtu.be/Tkr-azJVTAM
I wonder if LeBron threatens any police officers in this movie.
thank god ..i thought our movies are ridiculous
LeBron James hates cops
Next level
they took out pepe le pew i won't be seeing this crap he is my fave
2:10 ew  like if you agred
#restorethesynderverse
This movie will be incomplete without a Big Chungus cameo
I'm gonna pass on this. Doesn't look appealing to me.
LeBron James and the multi verse of basketball
Fix lola bunny
Fix lola bunny

I wonder if this is canon in the Shut up and Jam Gaiden timeline.
Remember when this used to be MJ mixed with Classic Cartoons?  *Now this is Warner Bros. The Movie!*
Chinese propaganda pushed by Lebron James their puppet. WAKE UP!!
*Kidnaps son*   King of the Server verse: *So anyway, we gonna play some basketball*
Not a fan of the CGI used on the toons
You're next.
Just came to leave my DISLIKE. The reason: LeBron James. Not gonna watch.
No interest in supporting this with LeBron James in the lead role after his latest you're next tweet.
LeBron James tried to ruin a police officer life with a tweet for saving a woman's life. He says he does his "Homework". Bend the knee for China & wears BLM this guy is a joke.
No thanks
Rotten tomatoes lol
LeBron James just threatened the life of a police officer on Twitter. Shame on Warner Bros. for putting this person in a movie.
Read The ( The Script A Mafia Story ) A Novel That Is Like A Movie For Your Mind! Snitches Get Stitches
What’s better space jam or space jam a new legacy
I can't wait for this!
So, this is Ready Player One - Part 2?
Lebron wants to be jordan bad wearing number 23 and calling his movie space jam
Movie is trush
How can I get a movie without copyright please 🥺
Now I'm debating whether the movie's gonna be good or just relying on nostalgia
this is like if ready player one and the new tom and jerry movie had a baby, and decided to invite lebron while they were at it
Dame got some real competetion
LOOKS AWFUL!!!!
well it doesn't look as bad as i expected it
wait... why is no one talking about the Game Of Thrones intro theme/title and the Westeros World Lebron flies by at 0:34?
I love how it starts by flying over a billion dollar house and then acts like we're supposed to care about his kid. o.O
bravo bravo bravo bravo bravo bravo
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
GOVNO
There is no backlash about Lola as was about Sonic huh...
I am goddamn excited
He is almost at 10M
Give a re design to lola
Alright even tho many ppl will think I dont know what space jam is or idk when they see this comment belive me I know and I love the movie
Lebron Really? You have to do everything  M. Jordan did and still you will be second. Sad.
COMMON AND SLAM AND WELCOME TO THE JAM
Lebron's acting is whack!! But I'll let it pass coz he's king
BIG CHUNGUS
0:55 Harry Potter conically exists in looney tunes

1:39 YOOO that was the scooby doo van
Stanley Kubrick is rolling in his fucking grave after showing the Clockwork gang standing side by side with White Walkers and Scooby Doo
This looks dumb
lebron literally flops twice in 30 seconds in, CANT WAIT
wow looks like shit, so glad the kidtards these days only have a 5 second attention span  LOL LEBRON IS A PRODUCER LMFAOOOOOOOOOO
This movie is gonna be awesome
In the last film, they were playing for the survival of the Earth. Now, it's just a guy saving his kidnapped son. LAME!
This looks awesome. The first one is a classic.
Dtyuurr
I wonder how many WB interns are on this post
Sorry this will never live up to the prequel
make a trailer tally wonderland movie a based on willy wonderland and banana split
Feel like i just saw the whole movie already 😂😂😂
Am I the only one who sees literally no difference in Lola?
They should do 3rd part with Boban Marjanovic.

I hope they remove the Clockwork Orange guys from the movie when this comes out. Same goes for the Harry Potter characters.
Damn

Lola Bunny isn't in this movie?
Does Warner Bros. really hate Penelope enough to not include her as part of the team (like in the XBOX promo) without Pepe?
Where is Pepe Lepoo ?

So Pepe le Pew is too much but its ok to add child eater Pennywise and the cast from the Clockwork Orange into the film.  Kek.
1:37
wheres Brony?
1:46 lmao I guess Pennywise wanted to take a break from eating kids and just watch some basketball
As a hardcore original space jam fan... I can honestly say I look forward to seeing this!!
After 25 year finally have another space jam
This guy wants to be Jordan so bad
Look at how they massacred my girl. NOT WATCHING!!! OR ELSE DELAY THE MOVIE FOR ANOTHER YEAR AND GIVE US THE OLD LOLA BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bro this has already 20 mil veiws and its the FREACKING TRAILER. dude wat is going to be the box office money????
lola got the biggest downgrade in history
#restoresnyderverse
Lebron James is going to save his son and the Looney tunes are gonna help him
It's not space jam without Jordan. Smh. 👎👎👎👎👎
Lol I was hoping for mars to want revenge, this isn't a sequel but more of a reboot to our original
The mask on the right 2:18
If Kobe was still alive he would of been better in this movie don’t you agree REST IN PEACE
Warner bros we’re sorry for everything forgive us it was for fun don’t banned us
Did I just saw game of thrones?
They better use the original theme song for the credits at the very least...
This movies wreaks of being desperate to cling onto years of scripts and promises and wasted money, hoping to get what might've already been contracted or paid for back. And going with the "much, much bigger" and "more, more money!" angles. The ready player one thing, the "king james" cause apparently he doesn't have a name, the wierd animation than CGI part, the fact the opposing team look like overwatch OC's...not to mention the obvious wokeism. Suprised they even let Yosemite Sam do that gun part. Also I could care less if "you think and hate anyone who disagrees," there's no reason why a film hitting on nostalgia and aimed at younger kids can't be good. These people making movies nowadays do not understand why films like the original Space Jam, Who Frammed Roger Rabbit, literal looney tunes cartoons, etc, are loved by people of all ages. Especially not people who claim to be fans who think no one should care if this is low-tier cash grabbing-like Tom and Jerry (2021) twice in one year. Though the latter was more smurfs/alvin chipmunks then whatever space jam 2 is supposed to be-other than someone's bad fan-fictio (lola training with amazon warriors from WW-what?)
This movie looks like it’s gonna flop hard
1:46 Is that penny wise behind the blue guy
I wonder where's tom and jerry?
I threw up in mouth watching this garbage.

I have doubt nowadays kid know loney tunes.
If LeBron really loved us, he'd put out "Space Jam 2" on Netflix right now.
I guess king kong decided he needed a break from the events of zilla vs himself to play a relaxing game of basketball.

Those 21 dislikes are Jordan fans
This whole trailer, to quote Nathie... "Is it just me or does the new Space Jam feel like a basketball themed Ready Player One movie?"  They be goddamn right, WB really screwed this up big time....  Oh and pause at 0:35 and the Game of Thrones logo is on there
Pepe Le Pew. I Stand with you! I hereby boycott this movie and will never allow my children or my children's children to watch this deplorable display. Amen
Ready Player 2: Electric Basketball Boogaloo

"01:09" 😂 I actually have been using  *𝐖𝐀𝐓𝐂𝐇𝐃𝐀𝐃.𝐂𝐎𝐌* 📌 no issue with it all
"04:05" 😂 I actually have been using  *WATCHDAD.COM* 📌 no issue with it all
https://youtu.be/m1Iy9VSBg5A -> this music intro is better. you failed Malcolm D. LEE
Man this makes me so hyped up.
Is no one going to talk about 1:33
Почему так мало негров?
The original is better...
"00:30" 😂 I actually have been using  *𝑾𝑨𝑻𝑪𝑯𝑫𝑨𝑫.𝑪𝑶𝑴* 📌 no issue with it all
I might not like what they did to Lola Bunny.. but at least they did not remake this into one of those Woke Movement disaster movie.
Just nobody remember Micheal Jordan version
So Basket Ball Player One?
"03:24"  I would stick to *(𝗪𝗔𝗧𝗖𝗛𝗗𝗔𝗗.𝗖𝗢𝗠)*  that's where we get ours
"08:81" The only working one is *(𝗪𝗔𝗧𝗖𝗛𝗗𝗔𝗗.𝗖𝗢𝗠)*

Wait for the Big Chungus reference
#CanellaNoSpaceJam
No more thick Lola unfortunately

TIME TRAVEL is very POSSIBLE Let me demonstrate... Watch this...  4:44 Hello 4:45 ... 4:46 ... 4:47 ... 4:48 ... 4:44 Hello again 4:50 Bye
Y'all really messed up a classic like this? WTH is up with creative team? Are they having constipation? Cause this is a whole lot of bulls
"00:40"😂 Greetings!  But it's much easier with *𝗪𝗔𝗧𝗖𝗛𝗗𝗔𝗗.𝗖𝗢𝗠* 📌 as I know
"00:24" 😂 Well I used *Watchdad.𝒄𝒐m'*  📌 and frankly it's real
Read The New Novel,,, The Script A Mafia Story! It's a movie for your mind. Snitches Get Stitches
2:23 Professor be like:
Lebron James is going to be more famous thanks to this movie
"05:29"The only working one is *𝗪𝗔𝗧𝗖𝗛𝗗𝗔𝗗.𝗖0𝗠*
yeah he might be good a basketball but as a person he is a ahole  and his acting looks so bad FU hollywood get new ideas and stop running 90's movies
It's still hard to believe that bugs bunny is a rapist now
"0:27"After wasting time on different sites, a friend of mine recommended  *𝗪𝗔𝗧𝗖𝗛𝗗𝗔𝗗.𝗖0𝗠* and it worked perfectly for me
Personally I don't think they needed a multiverse situation, but I'll still give it a shot.
I just wish Kobe was still here to do this movie
"0:28"The only working one is *𝗪𝗔𝗧𝗖𝗛𝗗𝗔𝗗.𝗖𝗢𝗠*
You're probably going to have more 30+year olds watching for nostalgia than actual kids haha
"00:30" 😂 I actually have been using *𝑾𝑨𝑻𝑪𝑯𝑫𝑨𝑫.𝑪𝑶𝑴* 📌 no issue with it all
Now that I think about it, is anyone getting a bit of Sponge Out of Water vibes?

Zendaya plays Lola. At first i didn't really wanna watch the movie. But now that i saw this trailer and heard Lola talk, i kinda wanna see it now. Also LeBron James and Zendaya previously worked together on Smallfoot. Another film from Warner Animation Group.

This movie is gonna be shit youve changed the story fucked the whole movie in my opinion its meant to be the Looney Toons vs The Monstars not the whole wb universe you wankas and you get the biggest wanka in the nba to play the G.O.A.T Michael Jordan. Wb you are idiots
woww
Space Jam Funny !!															 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wiNBj7OOpk&list=PL0xT9ZsMTbCzT9LChjayPOuKM_MmVfIu9
I'm gonna lose it if the final boss battle is MJ
am i the only one who thinks the 2d animation looks cheap af? Like they used flash or smth
Directed by Malcolm D. Lee
You will never be Michael Jordan.
Wish it was still jordan. Not some replacement.
Warner Bros. Pictures presents a new comedy from Malcolm D. Lee.
This summer, get ready to jam again.
You *cannot* do a SJ sequel without MJ. Bron is a legend, but does *not deserve* this role. Trainwreck was his movie, and it's too bad it was written by a "comic" who steals her jokes. F*** Amy Schumer.
I have mixed feelings about this? His son was kidnapped so he needs to play basketball?
Last time i was this early, WWII wasn't a thing.
i'm just waiting for this like 20 years loll😱😁
Kong in this  we need godzilla and tom and jerry Animanicas
I find it interessting that you used the classic Looney Tunes characters in this movie but thanks for ruining a good old classic movie by remaking some millenium trash. Typical uncreative moviemakers these days.
Drilling in the name Qing James.
Imagine a Messi cameo. 😳
They need kong the game need him
Me just watching this behind my dad on his phone
Ready Player One Anyone?
lola getting nerf
It would have been more relevant if you do a pokemon version or marioworld or dragonball. nobody watches looney toons anymore.
I will never love this the way I loved the OG but damn am I excited for this
Nice trailer
What the fuck is Yogi Bear doing in this?
Thank god they got rid of Pepe Le Pew but decided to keep the 4 dudes who tied up and raped that lady in A Clockwork Orange.
Where is Adventure time Appears in this Film?
Where is Regular Show Cameo is?
This gone low key be better then Jordans
I just- I just can’t... can’t look at this butchered Lola bunny...
So I chide WB for making Lebron right handed when he writes, he's left handed and only shoots right. Details matter lol
THE IRON GIANT, THE IRON GIANT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Maybe I'm just jaded and cynical, but I feel like all of these extra characters and franchises being shoved into this movie (Iron Giant, Scooby Doo, Flintstones, etc) is just to pander to nostalgia as much as possible and is only really being done because this kind of thing was popularized by the Lego Movie and the MCU. Like idk, it's always cool to see these characters again, but it doesn't sit right with me somehow.
😍😍😍
Lord Jesus  what on earth did i just watched ?????
😍😍😍
😍😍😍
I am excited for this movie to come
Imagine if this was with KD instead of Lebron and KD's like "I gotta do what's best for me" and then joins the enemy team lmao
Audience: Woo finally a space jam sequel, no way they could ruin something this simple and fun...  Trailer: I'm here! 💩
How about "Eeeeehhhh, what's up big chungus"? Well Bugs Bunny is Big Chungus.
I love how the old girl did that
Eww a movie with Commie James
Ha, this looks terrible. Not a single line sounded good
So Sick
BOOM you looking for your son?!
2021 coming up with banger movies so far
Song pinged out "jam" coz there is no jam this time xD
WoW H-B cartoons are in there
Warner Brothers Universe is activated.
This would be great if ready player one didn’t exist

I like space jam movie
The team that  did the trailer music and syncing is doing a great job
ohh yeahhh 😍🔥🔥🔥
I chuckled when Yosemite Sam was shooting the basket ball with his pistols.  That's about it.
Is Lebron woke in this one?
Looks horrible. why is this called space jam? this is just all warner bros IP rendered in 3d, trash just trash. its matrixball. come on LeBron you should be doin better
King James

1:59 *gulp* We're toast.
Noticed there's no Pepe La Pew, we get it, more wokeness
forgot the secret formula...
It doesnt matter what you take him hostage or anything.... You still have to refer him as KING JAMES
Idk.....  The original "fit" this just has better graphic effects.... but it's the continuity there? Can we stop touching classics please
It should've been kobe😔😔😔
I hope Quad City is getting ALL THEIR COIN!!!!
*Why aren't the grandma's boobs nerfed too?*
1:05 I like how traditional animation is coming back to theatres
Fake i didn't see him says : "wanna sprite canberry ?"
Damn! Lebron that fine?!
GuysS pause it at 1:46 you see pennywise from it
Looking at lebron in an elevator doorway makes me realize how tall the NBA really is
Kobe should’ve been starring in 2
I’m guessing in 10 years We’ll have The Disney Princesses helping Fred Savage’s grandson win a Fortnite tournament against Tupac’s - hologram and Deadpool!
Oigan porque la coneja esa no está simpeable
I want the Pepe Le Pew cut
All I saw was CGI nonsense that we all come accustomed to these days. The original on the other hand was ahead of its time and will never be replaced.  Love the fact that WBs flexing all the characters they own like Disney does god the ego these corporations have.
Not a James fan but this looks watchable at least.  Won't touch the original, however.
The bite-sized client methodologically whirl because noise philly ski sans a rare jail. chemical, determined security
Боже, какая же ху*та. Xuetaaa
BIG MEH! The movie seems like it is just filled with tons of CGI, NO SOUL!  As always the original is the better choice.
Ready player one plus the matrix 😎
This is ironic that companies that have many IP's don't use them at all
Will we see the monstars? I swear they stayed with the tunes
Tanto les cuesta traer o buscar a los actores de doblaje originales de la película anterior?? Con tanta cancelación los que realmente iremos a ver la película no nos va a gustar que le cambien el doblaje a todos los personajes
Wrestlers would hate this movie! 😂💪
When I saw the Iron Giant I cried. Not another re-run. Not another re-run! I don't want to go outside!

Dude this is gonna be sick
Ngl this might turn out better than I expected!
Sucks I'm not seeing any smash bros jokes.
Garbage
"Tune World"
thumbs up
This looks like the WORST MOVIE IN HISTORY.
Iron giant hell yeah
Ready Player 2 is the sequel we needed
Hypeddd
Look how fast he can dribble 2:24
2:14 2:15 "Yikes." - Bugs Bunny. 1:57 1:58 Daffy: (jaws drop)
Fuck yes
Granny's (Looney Tunes character) voice provided by Candi Milo, best known as the second original voice of Dexter in Dexter's Laboratory, originally aired on Cartoon Network way back in mid-90s. Candi Milo took over the voice of Granny from Looney Tunes (since 2017) due to June Foray's retirement in 2014 until her death in 2017.
Looks like a fun movie. Can't wait to see it!
Thank you Zack for giving us a great wonder woman
After all, they didn't realy get rid off guns. So DON'T TOUCH YOUR OWN CHARACTERS ANYMORE. Stop ruining our lives and childhood with these polemics.
basketball nice game at nba and pba
This is totally not what i was expecting
Yeah, no thanks. This looks like crap. Good thing you can't erase the original where fun was prioritized over woke nonsense.
Space Jam:es
Petition to have Space Jam 2 Nikey Shoes called "LBJ Bunny Shoes". Just my idea.  Edit: Granny's jersey number was her age 😆😆😆😆😆
I can tell this is going to be super cringe lebrons acting is super bad lol
netflix nova série ben 10✔😀
This gives SPACE jam a whole new meaning!
The biggest difference in the original and this moronically rehashed version, other than the wide disparity in talent, is that Disney chose a POS racist to play the lead.  The REAL Bugs Bunny would refuse to take the court with this pompous clown.  One thing for sure---- in this Spacejam there will surely be lots of flopping scenes during the game.
LaFlop again trying to surpass MJ in something. I'm not watching. Probably woke as fuck.
As soon as I saw Don Cheadle I knew this was going to be a good movie.

I just came here to make sure Daffy didn’t actually call Yosemite Sam a dumba**.
1:37 big chungus
This is what Ready Player One could’ve been if the stuck to the book.
😍😍😍😍 this is going to be epic
I was amazed about this Space Jam A New Legacy trailer. When I first heard the person who owns the strange universe called Servaverse it was incredible but almost like your in the version of Ready Player One or more less.
Who saw yogi bear lol
I can't find Big Chungus in the trailer, i need help.
Daffy gonna steal the whole dam show again. Cant wait!!! 🦆❣
Definitely killed space jam already by the trailer.. No ball that gives them the juice? No monstars? Why us apace jam title? If its nothing like space jam, call it ready player one basketball  ... bummer
We saw other characters  in r rated movies and more
*#RestoreThePepeLePewScene*
Ready player 2 looks great.
Trash 🗑
Dude im not ready for real life chungus
This looks A w f u l l l l l l l l l

1:05 The dust is a hoop and a basketball
It’s like Ready Player One meets Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle and Space Jam.
That Space jam vortex did a miracle on lebrons hair.
No thanks.
The Easter Eggs and references in This Movie Is Over 9000!!!!
Who else keeps looking at the trailer
(:
0:01 is that a Nintendo switch? Nice cameo
does anyone else *not* like the 3d? i liked the 2d.
Jeez.. Really they pick LeBron James to make this movie?? He is so expressionless and bad at acting that you can literally feel it from the trailer itself... Good job hollywood.. The saga of: screwing good movies just to make money by leverage on peoples memories using famous people to increase sales is going great!!
You know what world stop trying to go back to the golden days with all these shitty remakes. Come up with new ideas or dont make anything at all. Stop ruining peoples memories with shitty remakes.
Stay Tuned meets Ready Player One.
The perfect sequel doesn’t exi-
This movie will be 100% horrible.
Ok who gave war machine Stark’s experiment from Civil War?
Anyone else looking forward to the revival of the Slam Jam remixes? Just Me? Okay...
Toons!!
Nerfed Lola Bunny...
I have a better title.  Lebron James: I'm good and give me your money! (Idiot!)
Space jam a new legacy here we come

They also own Harry Potter too so I hope we get someone from there!
Cartoon Lebron James looks not much like him IMO. Needs to be darker and more square of a head, not that weirdness.
all these warner bros rights license being together its remind me of Ready player one.
Music Question - Artist - Track Name?
I don’t like LeBron James
Unfortunately, when you make Lola Bunny less thicc there isn't much to amount to.
Zion will be cast for the next one
I really hate how many good movies and series is gonna be on hbo max >=( i don have freaking hbo max
Pretty incredible special effects. Just look at how they fixed LeBron's hairline.
Are you ready player 2?
Yea....that was pretty bad
Looks like overhyped crap. Let's wait for gross income statistics
I like the visuals... and the beat. Nice gowns, very nice gowns...
Bro this looks like the ready player one trailer
Yea,this is epic
Nobody: This movie: the WarnerBros Cinematic Universe
This should have been the premise for another Taken movie!  Liam Neeson can ball!!
dang, this looks unwatchable.
WB: *Literally includes every cartoon character ever made* Me: where big chungus
Lola what have they done to you
What a disgrace to the original space jam
More like “Ready Player Jam”
This one cheap looking commercial
Great
I DIDNT KNOW DAN AKROYD WAS IN THIS PICTURE!!!
No tiene buena pinta.
How the fuck are people excited for this, it looks awful. And no, the original isn’t a good movie either.
This is supposed to be ready player two
Get woke, go broke.
“We need Kong”  Kong: Sure, but I gotta watch a basketball game first
No Pepe no party. This movie looks like absolute garbage regardless
Honestly, This looks way better then it has any right to be. I'm gonna watch the hell out of this!
why didnt bugs say eh whats up bron
Okay this is *EPIC* I loved the original!
I'd really like Bugs or one of his gang to mention they did a basketball game with Michael Jordan. I'm just saying it might be time to repeat some Warner Bros basketball history.
1:20 why does it say Yosemite is a rooster?
Did we just see the whole movie in 2 minutes ?!
Im looking forward to seeing Cinema Sins sinning this.
Woof! You guys have fun with this one. I think I'm gonna pass.
incredi-fucking horrible!
How is King Kong in this mov- nvm
Panalo!!!
>Removed Pepe le Pew cuz "muh rape culture" >Made Lola Bunny less feminine cuz "muh sexism" >But showing actual rapists from adult movies and tv series is fine Double standards at its finest.
CRINNNGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE LOL
Bugs bunny is like Mickey Mouse.              But 100,000,000,000 times better.
havent i watched this before nvm this is new cant wait
"I bet Will Smith doesn't have to deal with this" Had me 🤣🤣🤣
Imma pass
i thought space jam is a sandwich
This looks about as bad as the original
Trash, i cant wait
This looks A triple S
"Joss was bragging that he's had it out with Gal. He told her he's the writer and she's going to shut up and say the lines and he can make her look incredibly stupid in this movie." wowwwww that's so freaking petty
So... where are all the people complaining about Lola Bunny's chest now?
Queston #1: Why didn't they just use Lebron's actual children they're famous and old enough to act.
Needs more Pepe Le Pew
How do you manage to screw up the concept of cartoons and basketball?
I hate to sound sour but...I hate it! 🙄
Movie is gonna be bad way to much going on
So Pepé Le Pew is out but why ClockWise with Orange??
Bruh how are they going to remove Pepe lepu but add the rapists from clockwork orange? Lol wtf
I wish it was Kobe instead but still...R.I.P Kobe we miss u lotsT_T
I do wish it was MJ but he's up in age so its understandable :3
This looks amazing and I can't wait for it XD It gets irritating how people r bitching about this film and its not even out yet. Can't people just enjoy movies anymore I mean jeez people stop bitching about movies and let's just enjoy them. Yes this is different from original which will always be a classic but its also good to try out new things :3
Michael Jordan better have a cameo in this.
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
I like how he says” if u ok want your son back you gonna have to play basketball” not knowing he just challenged lebron James to a basketball match
i wonder when are they fixing lola bunny's design
Disney : we have Wreck N Ralph    WB : Two can play that Game (Actually they did ready player one and now space jam a new legacy)
That’s gonna be horrible
This is basically a  cartoon 🎥 bout Lebum assembling a dream team of Allstars just to lose 3 out of 4 to the Warriors 🏀 i mean the Monstars👹 😆🤣
1:46 pennywise
"What in the Matrix hell?" - LeBron James 2021
This 🎥 feels like the real deal with Lebron 👑🦁 talking about how he needs to assemble a dream team 🏀 😏where have we heard 👂 that b4 ?🤔  I guess their right about how history repeats itself...even in cartoon 🎥 😆🤣
2:17 if you look closely,you can see yakko wakko and dot from animaniacs on the right
the script could be better, in the first film they chose to play basketball ... in this one the villain arrives challenging him to play basketball ... clueless
Looks like shit compared to the original
should be kobe
imagine if we could pull a sonic the hedgehog and make lola what she couldve been.
WHERE IS PEPE LE PEW
Needs Bill Murray
:
Boom. Looking this for?
Whatahell did i just watched?
I'm gonna take my daughter to see this and she's not going to understand why I'm crying
The elite team part 👍🏽🤣🤣🔌it's pluggin Superman, gandalf, king Kong, iron giant royalty only
ola ALbrigHTr
Warriors blew a 3-1 lead
lola AL
lola
I gonna been the banana splits please
At 1:44 who is that flying Figure in the background is it Superman ? Could someone answer that ?
2002
they sould make a shooting stars meme of lebron now because of dis
it was unnecessary to cancel Pepe Le Pew, just change his personality
Please continue the Monster Verse
oh no
I love space jam!!!
I can not wait 😱
I really had no idea someone can really space jam until watching this.  All I can say is way to go.... Wayne to fuckin and go guys.  Way to take a classic and make a sequel from dragging it through trash for no damn good reason.
Wow, this looks...bad
Y be bronny look like that
A lot of people have pointed out that this feels very Ready Player One-esque. But I still wanted to point out that the shot at 2:24 has the Night King from Game of Thrones on the left, the droogs from A Clockwork Orange in the center right, Cheetarah in the upper right, a Flinstone dinosaur in the upper left, and the Scooby Doo Crew+Mystery Van in the center. Shit is just bewildering to me why they're pulling all these random franchises in.  E: How to why
This is ready player one just basketball lol
Cheadle is probably the only one to call Lebron a clown and get a away with it
:[ why did they remodel Lola? What are they gonna do next??.  , Remove every thickness of Jessica rabbit :|
That wave of nostalgia when Bugs appeared. God I miss the classic cartoons.
Please don’t ruin it with 3D
No just no
Lebron bad at acting
Naw I'm good 🤣 on this But ohio love
They are trying to make something more than it needs to be
Anyone else mad that Pepe le pew is not even here like wtf. just because the left has their balls twisted because he is “rapey” doesn’t mean he is an og character who is even in the original space jam like wtf
This looks as lame as I thought it would be, but with a weaker plot.
And they said Infinity War was the best crossover of all films...
The characters from the other movies are in space jam 10/10
Basically Ready player one But basket ball
#restorethesnyderverse
Place jam
As soon as I saw the iron giant and the games of throne dragon and other ppl I was screaming hard I'm ready to see this......
Uhh wtf
Lola what have they done to you your flat #bringbacklola
We all know it would’ve been Kobe in this movie if he was still alive 😢❤️
I looked closer and saw joker and the mask
Will Big Chungus join?
It’s obviously going to suck and the writers should’ve been fired. At least kids will like it. Looney Tunes and Lebron fans deserve better.
1:26   "shoot the ball" *Sam uses his guns to actually shoot the ball* reminds me of  "cut the cards"  *bugs bunny chops the deck of cards in half with a clever*
2:23 -> Kubrick likes this
Yo this is sick
😑 no
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaBqOQBIH8-mRH7aU4HM_VA
Shoulda had bronny as the son
All I have to say is 🔥🔥
Where is Kobe?
They are really doing this Hanna-Barbera universe and I love the way the way they are doing it
Look how they massacred our girl
Why did you guys change Lola Bunny to a new design
Why pick a basketballer who hates white people and is clearly on chinas payroll?
Kobe bryant would be spinning in his grave right now, and I get a feeling lebron james is seeing this as "what have they done to an old classic"
Looks great too bad im 28 :p
Dope entrance to luney toon world
This looks astonishingly awful.
so... they have stuff and characters from franchises like GOT and IT but somehow pepe is cut???  funny world we live in   idiocracy is becoming more reality with each and every passing year
They fucked space jam for me wtf is this my childhood ruined
So you removed a Skunk because in the most extreme case it insinuates a certain bad behavior but yet you allow a gang cameo from a movie that is all about that bad behavior in the most extreme way. Great Job WB! Really woke choices you making.
Nececito hacer un logo de Warner Bros como le hago que alguien me pueda ayudar
The dislikes are the people who know they gonna lose in the movie
Still ruining the classics I see🤦🤦🤦
They ruined the Movie. 😠😠😠😠😡😡😡😡
Who else see the game of thrones world....
What is this, Ready Player One, Two?
The Animaniacs better make at least ONE appearance in this movie
1:38 scooby doo 😁
Where is big chungus
I cannot wait to see this movie
"Awesome"
As someone old who never saw the first one and has no kids, this is an easy no thanks.
Virtual world , NFT World
🏀🏀🏀🏀
Everything in our childhoods, they have to ruin.  This will be an absolute load of shite.  Fuck Lebron James and fuck Hollywood.
I feel like this is gonna be the most ultimate crossover movie yet
ui get see tthag movie space jam 2  basketball frist night  sold out i need see movie this summer
The whole “King James” bit seems so forced.
Why do you gotta be tron?
I’m crying
I find it hilarious that this implies that don cheadle is the king of warner bros
Man, a lotta these people are SALTY. I love the OG Space Jam, but this a breath of fresh air. It's 2021 for F sake. The first Space Jam was a staple, monumental even, but MJ's acting was straight trash. From a "movie" standpoint, without the "it was the first, it was monumental" shit, the OG Space Jam was just not that great of a "movie".  Also, LeBron's not tryna copy Jordan by doing this, it is a homage to the original. He even asked MJ to be a part of it, but MJ declined.
Hey! I thought we don't do guns in Looney Tunes! 1:26
bunny no sexy anymore.....
This sucks
Don’t get me wrong I’m a big fan of Lebrun but at 0:56 that “WAIT” was so fake lmao😂😂
So, let me get this straight.  Pepe Le Pew, a skunk who chased after a cat who he thought was a skunk, and the only reason she didn't like him was because he stunk (she liked him when she sprayed him with her perfume) is deemed absolutely unacceptable.  Yet, Pennywise, a character who lures kids into drainpipes and kills kids is deemed acceptable?  Anyone care to clarify the rational thinking behind this brilliant move?
Tbh if I was gonna do a space jam 2 it's be more like "Who framed Roger rabbit?" than "Pokémon" the Liveaction, Lola bunny does NOT look Hawt in this at all
LeBrons acting is so bad...
Looks promising, but........I’m not 100 on with it.
I was excited when I heard they were making space jam 2! But as much as it overall looks like it would be a great movie I will never watch it. I DO NOT support racism of any form, from anyone or against anyone!!LeBron James is openly racist against white people! He is an open black supremacist! Racism is not acceptable on any side, against anyone!
don cheadle will never be ballin
Lola bunny 😥

bronny lookin a lil diff...
Lola looks like she has cancer, im not going to be able to get over that lol.
I love the original space jam but this looks like crap it looks like cash grab garbage
I guess Don Cheadle didn’t listen to the voicemail where LeBron was like “I do have are a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my son go now that'll be the end of it” 😂😂😂
doesn't look good,  but obviously im not their target demographic
Jordan > lame bron
THEY EVEN FUCKED UP THE SPACE JAM THEME!
0:35  He didn't even stop at westeros to say Hi to Tyrion Lannister
#RestoreTheSnyderverse     #ReleaseTheAyercut
Ok, no dabbing the trailer. Good
Lefraud
What in the matrix hell😂
Ok so we’re just gonna ignore that before Pete sends James to tune world under Neptune is  Hogwarts?
It doesn't look as great as the first movie, but I'm still going to give it a chance. Maybe Michael Jordan will make a cameo appearance and it.
I cant wait wait for the lebron james to defend chinas human rights violations scene in the movie while he takes a knee in protest.
IRON GIANT!!!!!!!!!
I really want this to succeed but...
lol the song is Scylla by Rl Grime.
where are the other nba players wtf, fail
Warner Bros's Kingdom heart
The original was all about saving the looney toons home this is all about an overbearing farther saving his kidnapped son. This needs to have the same cartoon characters with a similar look to them in order people not to get upset how they ruined a classic cartoon.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS
So this isn't really a true Space Jam 2. It's really another "modern reboot". Cause I feel if it was a sequel you would think the loony tunes would remember they played the MonStars for their freedom from Moron mountain. I mean you got Yosemite Sam blasting daffy away over here instead of picking up the ball. But hey whatever. 🤷‍♂️
Mixed feelings.... It will never be the same as watching it in 5th grade on vhs..... but that's why it has a 2 at the end
So is this a reboot or a sequel?
The original will always be the best
i can't belive some people still disliked this AWESOME TRAILER like why..
That’s gonna be a no for me dawg
This honestly looks terrible
They should do WB Animation vs Pixar Animation lol
So its basically WB flexing all the stuff they own
Hello
sorry but its like they tried too hard with this they just cant measure up to the original...
Warner Bros should have acquired Winnie the Pooh to make him Lebron' best friend
#RestoreTheSnyderverse #ReleaseTheAyercut Man of Steel 2 Ben Affleck Batman Movies Justice League Zack Snyder 2 3 Movies
Just complete disrespect to the original movie, utter garbage, SMH
"So you see, that's where the trouble started *again*"  2:10   "That smile, that damned smile"
This just looks like a movie to show off all the movies they own....
2:23 makes sense to have the characters from clockwork orange in space jam
Holy shit...this brought back childhood memories. So much cartoon characters...definitely gonna watch it😍
Oh god
Damn they even got Gorilla vs Kong
1:44 if you look closely you can See Yakko And dot
Imagine if there's a MJ cameo or reference
This movie is going to be like Lebum! A flop!!!
This looks crap
Wow! It looks like they made a mess of it. 👎😣
I can make trailer 2 back
so his son gets kidnapped by Don Cheadle bc he doesn’t wanna play basketball then becomes a cartoon the unbecomes a cartoon to play basketball with cartoons that have also uncartooned to save his son where somehow there’s the mom there watching this all happen?

What happened to my Lola? Look how they massacred my girl
Trash movie. Should of chosen a white basketball player, a woke change to the previous player on the original movie which was played by a black baller.
this is kinda disgusting
I do hope MJ cameo'd for this.
LeBron will be in the next Avengers

Why are there so many dislikes?
Im a 90’s baby i clicked the link with skeptical outlook, but this looks kind of lit I cant lie 😂😝 !!  Guess we’ll see when it drops 🙏🏾

haha small feet
mickey mouse movie doesn't count in my books
I watched similar movie But the movie charactor was jordan
Old movie with new taste!. Was king Mike, and now king James! Love it!!!
#portugal
I think this proves that MJ was the 🐐
Man... I'm just going to go watch who framed Roger rabbit.
I am worried that they will try to "update" the humor.
Super  super stupid
From the studio that brought you The LEGO Movie and Scoob!
It feels like it's a whole New movie like it's not continuing where the last one ended on
Still a bit salty about lola bunny.
This summer's LEGO Movie
Cancel space jam 2 don't give in to the wokeness
Видимо у трейлера на русском закрыли комменты, потому что там конкретно обольют нечистотами.
Ehhh.
This trailer is absolutely amazing. Having it's own feel to the Space Jam franchise too. Would've been so dope to see Bronny Jr in this haha. And Uncle Shannon too. Come July, we may just pop out to the theatre with our Space Jam jersey and basketball too lol.   When Bron was going for the dunk, we swore he was going to make it lol. But did ya'll Lola Bunny doing the D Wade pose when him and Bron was on the heat together after that famous photo?
I wonder if meatcanyon's bugs bunny will appear in this sea of Warner Bros copyrighted properties.
Gun violence at 1:26.
This look good
Food for thought: if Kobe was alive he would have stared in this instead of Lebron.
This looks amazing
I can’t be the only one that realized they made Lebron’s character light skin
Looks fucking terrible. Pass!   Space jam one here i come.
Don Cheadle playing the Devil is incredibly interesting.
1:23 rtx off 1:58 rtx on
17 million people will watch this
2:23 Singing in the rain
Did anybody see pennywise? 🎈1:46 he is in back ground.
LOLAAAAAAAA!!!!
Bro, they canceled Pepe le Pew but then include the clockwork orange guys. What is the logic there WB?
#IStandWithRayFisher #RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Looks wack! And that fool can’t even act DEFINITELY NOT WATCHING
I hope this is one of those movies where you think it’s going to be awful based on the trailer, but you wind up loving it. Better have saved all the good scenes because that trailer was disappointing. It’s going to be tough to compare to the original.
I speak for a lot of people when i say the only reason why I'm gonna see it is not just because of the amount of people in it. But the one fact that good ol' Iron Giant is in it. Let's hope it's better that RPO.
Please have Marvin the Martian instead of just his helmet
What they tease of the "updated" version of the song is a travesty.  None of the gen x/ millenials are gonna give this movie a stamp of approval if the new song doesn't *fuckin SLAP.*  That's half of why we loved the original.
1:46  Pennywise has returned.
What hypocrites if they cancel Pepe le pew and remove him from the movie and if they put a clockwork orange the progressives are shitting everything. as well as they put them put a pepe le pew
We all know the real goat is gonna come out and win the game.
I’m not watching this Lola bunny isn’t sexy this time
Couldn't uh......couldn't help but uh......notice the Clockwork Orange gang in the crowd.   A gang from a movie that likes to rape and kill for fun.....that's exactly what a FAMILY movie needs.   Just saying.
I mean the movie is marketed towards kids. Why would myself, a 32 year old adult now, have any passionate opinions about a movie that's not for me?
God bless you all in the mighty name of Jesus Christ he loves you and he’s coming back very shortly.I’m not promoting religion to u ok,just please hear me out,Jesus wants to have a relationship with you he wants you to receive his salvation it’s simple if you believe you’re a sinner and that Jesus Christ died on the cross to pay the price of your sin, confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and I believe in your heart God raised him from the dead and you turn from ur sins u will be saved,forgiven and sealed until the day of redemption God bless you all❤️💕
Oh please kill me
Why are the clockwork orange ppl in this? They rap ed the shit out of some girl lol but u cancel pepe smh
Anyone else see Jabberjaw?
WB gets rid of Pepe Le Pew because he somehow perpetuates rape culture, inserts actual rapists from A Clockwork Orange into the background at 2:22. I guess the irony escaped them.
And to think that all this is for a few Instagram followers...
Dude, LeBron doesn't even need a team...
Wait the loony tune is a planet but in the original movie it was in the earths core I thought this was a sequel not another universe!
I feel like this trailer takes itself way too seriously
Didn’t expect to see pennywise
Noooo Lola bunny que te hicieron 😭😭

Movie looks trash
#RestoreTheSynderverse
1:46 Lol Pennywise 🎈
Wait, so Pepe was bad because he was looking for love, so he had to be cut from the movie. But the rapist and murderers from Clockwork Orange and the killer clown from IT is okay in a kids movie ? What the hell hollywood kinda sending some wierd signals here.
Don Cheadle is a bad guy. Never thought I would see this happen.
1:46 Pennywise?
shouldve been Kobe and you know it
what
Lebron just went to isekai
Since Grandad is here now we need Woodman and the characters from "Lovelive! School idol festival" to finish off the roster.
In space jam should be with steph curry so they can help each other to win
Go lebron your  the best
“What in the Matrix hell?”  Might be the worst line ever written
2:02 It’s Michael Burnham 😍
After the death of Tony Stark, Rhodey becomes the new J.A.R.V.I.S.
I cannot believe they added the flint stones, King Kong, the iron giant, etc. Warner Bros. has a hysterical mind of its own animation
They should learn to not mess with Granny!!!!
Granny got some MOOOOOOVES!!!
That’s why he’s the GOAT
2:14 NO!!!😫😫😫😫😫No way that's not a fowl,man!!!😡😡😡😡😡
Original looks better tbh
All Lives Matter
Hollywood: where the worst movies get remakes and there's no room for original ideas.
Some movies just don’t need to be re made
they did Lola dirty with that remodel
why is superman's name there and king kong's name-
This is an Insult to the first space jam.
So its just like the first movie except without humor.
I gotta see that movie😂🤣
Would never watch this has no resemblance to the Original. And already even in preview is extremely disappointing. Warner Brothers once again ruining something they already mastered seems they need some new minds of imagination and rid the ones they have.  SJ Classic turned upside down and just plained ruined.
Me: *sees Westeros* “You had my curiosity, now you have my attention”
"So what do you think of the movie" 2:14
Puros negros, que pedo
You removed Pepe Lé Pew, but not the Clockwork Orange ultraviolent rapists?
Ok, hear me out, should have been that the Looney Tunes went looking for Michael Jordan again but end up at Michael B Jordan's house by accident.......ehhh? ehhhhh?
I'd rather try and take food from a wolverine in a locked room.
How dare they, this is so blasphemous to the original, Nope not a fan and won't be watching it (Well, I might just to give it the benefit of the doubt, but I doubt it's better than the Original). How about they stop doing remakes and do something original, there is enough copycats and remakes already, uuugh. I can't believe it. The real Space Jam/The Original was one of my favorite movies while I was growing up and still is. OOOOh , so irritating, haha. *Mega Sad Face*
Well looks like I'm going to be re-watching the original when this comes out.
They should’ve made this movie when Lebron was in his prime. He looks old now.
I think I'm going to have a heart attack😂
🤦🏼‍♂️ Why? 🤷🏼‍♂️
I loved the original space jam as a kid and this looks pretty dope. Can't wait to watch it
1:08 "GEAR THIRDDD!!!"
MAKE LOLA BUNNY'S CLOTHES SHORTER AS IT WAS BEFORE
MAKE LOLA BUNNY'S CLOTHES SHORTER AS IT WAS BEFORE
MAKE LOLA BUNNY'S CLOTHES SHORTER AS IT WAS BEFORE
I'm not watching this simply for the fact that the PC Police decided that Pepe La Pew was a rapist and shouldn't be allowed to be in the movie. But it's okay to put in the murdering rapist Droogs from A Clockwork Orange in there.... makes sense Either way, I'm sure this sequel is going to suck ass anyway. No cameos of His Airness, The Monstars or Bill Murray.... I'll pass.
I hope lebrons acting is better the. This
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Lol, this actually looks pretty cute. I could actually see taking some of the kids in my life to this.
Though MJ is a better player LBJ is definitely a better actor...
I don’t really like Lebron but this actually looks good!
The animation good but  the concept to cringe
As much as I'd like to hate on a sequel of a classic this looks pretty fuckin bomb.
They should’ve made this movie when Lebron was in his prime. He looks old.
Oh dang this looks good!
Kobe ?
I'm just happy that they keep sam's pistols
How all y’all thought that was Bronny 😭😭 like he don’t got a whole other son that ball

We don’t need yet another remake!!
My guess for possible Warner Bros. and Warner Media cameos in this movie: Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah (MonsterVerse, with permission from Toho. Maybe have a Hanna-Barbera character ask "Where's Godzooky?", and make a reference to Kevin (Ghidorah's left head)) Scylla Behemoth Wonder Woman The Green Lantern Corps Aquaman Shazam Pinky and the Brain (possibly referencing the Animaniacs reboot) Finn the Human and Jake the Dog Jonny Quest and Hadji The Powerpuff Girls Ben 10, Gwen, Kevin, and Vilgax Rick and Morty Alfred E. Neuman (the mascot of Mad magazine) Harry Potter and Buckbeak (the movie adaptation is made by Warner Bros.) Parzival, Art3miz, Aech, Daito, and Shoto (from Ready Player One) Team RWBY (Rooster Teeth is owned by Warner Media) Doom Patrol (based on the HBO Max show, my guess would be The Chief, Cyborg, Elasti-Woman, Robotman, Negative Man, and Crazy Jane) Birdman/Harvey Birdman Zorak and Brak (possibly referencing Space Ghost Coast to Coast, Cartoon Planet, and The Brak Show) Mordecai and Rigby Harley Quinn The dire wolves from Game of Thrones Emmet, Wyldstyle/Lucy, Batman (LEGO version), and Unikitty (with permission from LEGO) Audrey II (from Little Shop of Horrors) Gipsy Danger, Cherno Alpha, Knifehead, Otachi, and Raiju (from Pacific Rim) Scorpion and Sub-Zero (NetherRealm Studios is owned by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment) Freddy Krueger The knight and ostrich from Joust (now owned by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment) George, Lizzie, and Ralph (both game and movie versions) Maxwell (from Scribblenauts) Sam (from Trick 'r Treat) T.O.M. (the mascot of Toonami)
What on gods holy earth is this disaster ?
So the  clockwork orange guys are in it for a split second but pepe lepew isnt?
I’m excited for the new movie but I thought Michael Jordan was going to be in it
Good like dislike ratio 😂
Just because you're a good basketball player, doesn't mean you're a good actor.
They should have called it the cyber space jam.
who is here because of suga
If the Character is Kobe, I think I’m in😭😭😭
Mark my word: *Kobe* *will* *show* *up* *as* *a* *final* *boss.*
Instantly turned off when Michael Burnham turned up. Probably will win the game for everyone and tell matey he's shit.
poopee
man the acting is just garbage wtf

This shit wack , labron is not a good actor lol stick to b ball
Could be wrong but i think the kid is the one behind all this

Which is better wreck it ralp 2 vs this
Koooooooooong😲
Bruh brownie should have been the kid
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Daffy should have a female counterpart on his side. Just like Bugs and Lola
I was like what's this bs and now I'm like sign me up lebron
Que mierda son, skins del fornait? Y que carajos le hicieron a Lola boludo, parece un conejo disecado
No monstars not cartoonish wtf is this:/
Imagine if Michael Jordan is actually apart of this movie, and I’m not talking about a cameo
Rip pepe le pu
❤️
That's what I call : metaverse
Song?
Everyone is here
I bet this gonna be a soft reboot like the new Jumanji movies where they acknowledge that the first movie happened, but it won't necessarily effect this one.
IT the clown just waiting kids in the crowd while they play
They really picked the biggest crybaby to place that part
So they in Wreck it Ralph world ok😂😂😂
Didn’t King Kong get put on his neck last week?
This movie’s gonna be awful!      I’m obviously gonna watch it!
Like it 👍👍👍
Other joostice league?
God i loved lola bunny 😻
Can't people just be happy to see 2D animation returning to theaters in some fashion? They always gotta look for petty reasons to bitch about something before seeing it.
It's Tron, Ready Player One, Ralph Breaks The Internet, and Avengers Endgame all into one.
guys kong came back again from the Godzilla vs kong and the bunny is called lonny toons
Everything owned by Warner Bros is going to be portrayed in this movie .it seems awesome😳😳.I can not miss this movie
Nobody: FlightReacts: This trailer literally defines Lebron’s legacy and proves Curry is better 🐬🐬🐬
WHAT     LESH GOOO
OMO DID U GUYS SEEN EVERY OLD TAYLOR SWIFT IN AUDIENCE SECTION???  TS IS HERE YASSS
I see some Mad Max war boys in the crowd! I might watch this movie just to snoop the background characters tbh
This could be fun!
Imagine if someone took your son and said "if you want him back you have to play basketball"
Man that’s lame such a letdown
Damn, Daenerys raised such talented dragons, they even play basketball!
My reaction to this: 2:13
Bugs Bunny?! count me tf in. I cannot miss this I grew up watching this nonstop even learnt English from his broken English 😂😂😂
Looks like a mess
Serious question. WHO ASKED FOR THIS?
Siri, what's fan service ?
What the bullshit is this bullshit? 🤯 Congrats Warner, you pulled a Disney. Ruining another perfectly good IP legacy. 🤦‍♂️
🤮🤮🤮🤮
this is amazing
Why does he choose komg for his elite tea, even tho Godzilla won in gvk so Cleary he’s more powerful. I guess he’s just too darn big too play basketball
https://youtu.be/JSENwbNJ0nY  فكره حلوه 😅
Man MJ was even a better actor then Bron, stiff as stiff gets.
I find it unsettling that don cheadle is in this
Wait- IS THAT OBAMA?!
Stop trying to remake good movies and just make a new one? Like wtf
Does Godzilla know that kong is in there
Beep beep! Why don't you back up that trash? I'll leave you like Liston, flat on your ass! You need to bounce back to North Carolina, kid Cause your rapping sucks more than Space Jam did!  -Muhammad Ali
Some str8 BS
lol 😂
what do you guys think?
Trash
IM COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMING
#restorethesnyderverse
Ohhhhhh myyyyy gggooooodddd my fvrt cartoon character 😭
movie actually comes out in June when bron plays the nets
2:30 funny how they censored lola bunny but gave grandma boobie physics! lol
Man this brings back memories as a kid who loves looney tunes and MJ, the crossover back then was really hype for me. idk if kids nowadays would understand how good this movie is before and bringing it back today still making us old generations smile
Is it mean, or does this actually look and sound BETTER than the original Space Jam?
*"We need Space Jam 3, The world needs him"*
LeBron: “Where is my son?!” bugs bunny : “in the back smokin that wabbit season pack”
Why? Why? Why do this? Who said this was a good idea? This is garbage. It doesn't make any sense. It seems like they're using the name of a nostalgic movie as a way to market this obviously terrible piece of garbage that if not associated, be it in name only, with a previously successful film, would go unloved, unwatched, and unpaid for. Just stop.
Que paso con Lola ?
Why didn’t they get Bronny?
As far as I'm concerned, THIS is the true Season 8 of Game of Thrones. Change My Mind.
This ain’t got nothing on Jordan’s space Jam
Sux, Michael Jackson 5ever
Lola Sucks, why they had to change it?
My boy pennywise leaves sewers just to watch lebron
imagine if michael jordan was the villain
Now this is what you call multidimensional.
This looks really really bad...
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Robot Damian is kinda bad tho 👀👀
Ohhh they trynaaaa bring us baaackk like lebrons hairline
wait so no catchy soundtrack??? why everything gotta be cool and edgy nowadays im trying to hear that funky space jam tune
Basically ready player one but the looney tunes are playing basketball to defeat war machine
#restorethesynderverse
Feel like an older Michael Jordan would have been SUCH a better choice
They actually had Me TV characters- my grandma watches that
TRASH FUCCD UP A CLASSIC
Is this an April fools joke? 🤦🏾‍♂️
LeBron james and war machine who knew they would be in here?
After seeing this shit I need to wash my eyes out with bleach
Get ready to face palm extra hard at this: I recently sent Kath Soucie some fan mail, congratulating her on reprising the role of Lola, just days before it was announced that Zendaya would get the role instead.
0:47 WB logo
Space Jam: *New Super Team*
Alright, so it's okay to not include Pepe Le Pew for _reasons_ , but we're gonna let _these_ guys from A Clockwork Orange have a cameo? 2:23 Hmm...
bronny still grounded 💀
Now live on my channel, send ideas in the chat and let's write a movie together!
Looks so Cool!!!!!
Daffy duck:Sam shoot the ball. Yosemite Sam shots with his gun to the Daffy beak and the ball. Daffy duck:Let's try it again. Show we. They have real guns in this movie after 10 years.I never realized I ever saw the the looney tunes having guns.
Nope, no, negative, neh eh, nein, nada, nil, nah.
This trailer is going to be so cool movie 🍿🎥
This movie needs the Sonic treatment. Lola and everyone else's looks so, so, so, SO bad.
Cinematic monkey's paw if I ever seen one. I wanted a sequel. I never asked for THIS.
this is going to be boringg 😩😴
Why the fuck are the Droogs in this?
Ready player one?
I am not excited for this movie at all it just doesn't feel right and it's not centered around the toons but just his son I dont like the plot I see so far but I'll watch it just to see if they pay homage to Michael Jordan for saving their universe
Why did anyone think that this was a good idea.... or even okay.... fire these people NOW
Official topped the list of worst remakes ever. And there’s a lot of movies on this list
1:46 to the right of your screen good sir.
Su madre! Apoyo latino para la pelicula, se ve muy entretenida :D
The kid in this movie is gonna become famous because of this movie
This looks pretty bad
King James 🤣
This does not look like a Space Jam movie. It looks more like a Ready Player One sequel or basically Ready Player One meets Wreck It Ralph meets Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
I rather see Charles Barkley than Lechina James. Pass
https://youtu.be/0kL7tXwSmy4 I'm Sick I'm Tired- Carmen

is this fanmade
I can't wait for this movie 🎥 I'm done with the original space jam already
1:44 Kong: OH YESS A SPACE JAM! If only my buddy Godzilla were here
#RestoreTheSnyderverse
Why couldn't they just cast Jordan while LeBron makes a cameo?
That's one movie I won't be watching. Can't stand that racist bastard.
Fact I mean
Fun gact that person the kiss dad is not LeBron James it is kirye Irvine
Are you winning dad?
Cartoon look nice, cgi is nice but i dont know something feel wrong.
Yeaahhh lebron
Check it out they got rid of pepe le pew and replaced him with clockwork work orange characters...... WEIRD
this is is trash WB
Is it me or does lebron completly suck at acting
Looks awful
this comes out on my bday
Tune world
I wonder if bugs and lola are still a thing in the movie
i cant wait!!!!
The only thing that would make the basketball game any better is a hole bunch uv characters from Mortal Kombat also make a few cameos.
Sell your soul to the devil and we'll give you a space jam movie
After the movie finishes its run, it will be revealed that every actor since Hollywood was created and was included in those miniature crowds of the movie.
In 1:45 Pennywise the Clown is there in New Space Jam 2!
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
when i first saw this i was on switch
Micheal Jackson meets his looney tunes friends again
everybody talking 'bout the movie or basketball, but what we truly need is hit 'em high part 2 with b-real, coolio, method man, ll cool j and busta rhymes!
neddy🥰😍🐰❤🧡💛💚💙👁👁👍🏻
Looks terrible and and this classic should have never been touched to make a sequel
Jordan was better
i can't belive there is lebron version now
That looks fake
Lol people are gonna talk about Lola bunny in this movie a lot aren’t they
Game of thrones? The ermerald city for the oz ????
The Serververse has every Warner Bros. Cartoon, Movie, and TV Show.
This looks pretty awesome!  I don't care what my brother thinks of this trailer, this looks pretty great to me!

Wtf is this wack ass movie
Bruh we playing rocket league basketball now? I was hoping lebron was gonna swish 3's cuh

These remakes are trash please stop
Would prefer a senior mj to lebron. This choker sucks and is also a bad person. China owns his clown ass.
Garbage!
Oh yeah baby
Come on and SLAM and welcome to the JAM
“Dad you never let me do my thing, I wanna be a dancer”  Gets fucking kidnapped*
STOP REMAKING CLASSICS. WHERE HAS ORIGINALITY GONE?!?! P.S. This just looks like a Ready Player One rip-off with a nonsensical plot
Lebron’s character asks for back up,  we see  Kobe and Gigi walk into the court..  🔥
wow
Wow but why him lmao I hate him but I can’t wait to see it with him and a new version of it
Son un asco dañaron a lola bunny
Droogs good Pepe Le Pew bad the hypocrisy at it's finest so not everyone from Warner Brothers is in this movie to funny I will stick with the old Space Jam.
i DONT HATE THIS
Amazing🔥❤💪
1:41 Drogon: a basketball match?! ITS GONNA GET REAL!!!!
pause 1:46 and look for penny wise
Dang kid chill LeBron is just tryna be helpful to teach u how to play basketball doing his best.
They should’ve made this movie when Lebron was in his prime. He looks old.
Another one ruined, shame
Yeah this ain’t it
1:39 Don’t do that, don’t give me hope :(
Looks pretty than I thought. Count me in Bron.
1:08  *CHEVRON JAMES*
1:11 ehhhhhh
Man I'm more excited to see this movie than to fix my life !!
Trying hard copy cat...
So I see the fuss they can have the droogs  in there but can't put pepe in the back
Looks like it's gonna suck
I had my doubts but looney tunes is just my childhood so eh I'll give it a shot
Watched the Trailer... So, it's pretty much a 25th anniversary since the Michael Jordan version. They were suppose to have this released a while back featuring Shaquille O'Neal but got pushed back. So now they are releasing it with LeBron James, personally I just don't like the guy, whines too damn much, he's somewhat conceded & thinks too highly of himself. Nevertheless, regardless of that, the actual futage seen in tbe trailer, it has its merits for a stand-alone & for being a next story/chapter. I wouldn't call this movie a sequel, just a next generation adaptation carrying it forward with new ideas & a new look. I'll most likely end up watching it, for the sole purpose that Don Cheadle is in it, (War Macbine forever)... Anyways, that's my insight...
Pretty sure they ran out of money to continue the 2D animation in the film so they changed it to 3D as a last resort
Wow this looks like absolute trash. Way to ruin the actual space jam legacy.
I love this part 0:59 - 1:03
Man this looks so bad
damn i didn't expect them to go up against x-men villains
damn they really hit us with the 3d. i guess they couldn't help themselves
Where pepe???
Where is Michael Jordan?
Still can’t get the idea the bugs bunny’s a rapist from meat canon
#restorethesnyderverse
This looks so bad lmfao defs not wasting my time or money on this garbage 🤣
the 1996 version visually looks better. i dunno the CGI looks weird...
Interestin
THIS LOOKS SICK!
This doesn’t look very good
Fu fu fu fah fuh fuck this shit I'm out, folks.
Yes
Why is nobody talking about the Dwayne wade bounce pass reference???
Why? 🤷‍♂️
Dislikers are all jordan fans
Thanks for ruining looney toons
1:25 this scene right here just makes me miss original loony tunes, man
Captain Planet is at it again...
Shoot the ball ok bang babg bang
Aka ready player one.
Trash next please😖
is that drogon?
Lebron will be fine, itll be like the 17-18 cavs where it was lebron v 5 in the playoffs
Que paso con Lola? Que le hicieron
Bugs Bunny is the final boss of racism
Fun fact: the 20k people that disliked this movie will be the first ones at the theater when this classic come out. And by first I mean the 12pm showing.
MJ did it better, and is still the better basketball player.
#NotMyLolaBunny
Ugh garbage
Looks awful
I loved the original space jam, but I have a feeling this movie is gonna suck   Btw #justiceforjohnnydepp
This looks like absolute trash
I don't know how I feel about cgi looney toons
Leaving the Droogs (Murder Rape Gang) in but Pepe le Pew out is BS.  Will skip this movie.
This is gonna be so cool!

it was so good i watched th e whole trailer

Hold the fuck up... They banned Pepe Le Pew for "normalizing rape culture", yet at 2:23 you can see the Droogs, a literal gang of violent rapists from A Clockwork Orange.
From a dumb but at times fun movie with one of the best people ever, MJ, to probably a dumb movie with one of the absolute worst people ever, LJ.  Hard pass.
👎
Who knows what track is playing?
Lmao Bron got hurt just to do this movie
Lost me at 3D animation
I'm all for it, can't wait to see it.
You should make a Lego version of this trailer
ive been saying it for more than a year. im surprised they put bugs bunny in the movie after warner bros forced ownership on a video that now makes bugs bunny a struggling rapist. we will never forget
Oh, the animation is pretty bad 😬
This was some hard cringe.
I can already tell Filmento is going to have a hay-day with this movie.
Stop shit on the classics!
This look basic lol Hope it’s not🤷🏾‍♂️
#restorethesnyderverse
Oh come on! What's up doc!  Lonely Tunes recruit and need MJ  for the team Then Lebron recruit Lonely Tunes for the team 🤣😂
i cant believe there is a space jam and ready player one crossover!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Suprised Godzilla isn’t hooping on kong
Nice movie, for kids.
Not watching it. Remember the French lover.
1:40 This is like the portal scene from avengers but just even more cross overs from everyone's childhood.
this looks so bad. lebron is such a  narcissist. get your own thing stop copying mike. you will never be like mike sorry bro
oh boy!
I've never been soo angry.. it dosent have the happy goofy vibe that space jam had.
Idc this is fire to me can’t wait to watch
I'm just here for easter eggs
I know the entire plot now. Thanks
I have a feeling kobe would of played in this if he didn't pass
that's not Mike that is lebron james
realy wb giving us back to back blockbusters
Ah yes, another big changoos movie lol
Oh I like this, but.. you could have improved LeBron's acting at least a bit through coaching.
The original movie came out in 1996. Animation has had 25 years to evolve. How did they possibly manage to make the animated characters look LESS dramatic than the original?
cant wait for the movie to come out!
We want the old Lola Bunny.
Looks really good! But it's never gonna be as good as the first one with the GOAT MJ
No, just NO. This is awful.
I liked this, looks fun
This is sooo bad...
I'm from the future this movie will suck
Daffy Duck : Sam shoot the ball Sam: shoots  the ball(literally) Everyone watching :🤣🤣🤣🤣
The MJ space jam was way nicer
yes Jorden withe the first movie then LeBron with the second movie but LeBron is better just like the second movie
Will we see a Michael Jordan appearance?
I hope theres like a kobe or mj cameo
1:46 pause and you see penny wise in the back
Thumbs up if you're excited to cop the new Tune Squad Jersey than seeing the actual movie.
NBA ratings are in the toilet thanks to LeWoke and I predict the same for this , I know no one who is planning to watch maybe LeWing is hoping all his comrades in china will put it over the top. Someone should tell LeJoke that he is not or can never hope to be considered better than MJ
I'm just here for Iron Giant.
So, cartoon and real world existing close to each other like in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" movie is not canon anymore?! I don't like it. Minus one follower in your serververs, Worner.
Indian here, Has anybody seen "Toonpur ka superhero" .. That!!
Idk the first one was better... Should have had jordan in it tbh
This is epic  By the way, #RestoreTheSnyderverse
Lola still flat
Not long before all these comments are erased and this is marked for stupid YouTube kids
I don't know about you guys but I want to see Gadalf play basketball
Hey cool that they included an ultraviolent rape gang in the trailer but cancelled Pepe le Pew
Noooooooooooo
What kind of movie is this explain someone😭
So Pepe Le Pew is bad... but Pennywise and Alex and his droogs from "A Clockwork Orange" are A-OK?
Aquele de antigamente é mil vezes melhor que esse
"They said the SnyderVerse would never come again" "It has to."  #RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Looks amazing and up to date! 👍 can't live in the 90s and expect it to be like the old one.
Can you spot Magilla Gorilla?
Will this movie be on netflix?
To see it
Fun fact: Lebron James is actually a professional basketball player
So no Pepe Le Pew? but the RAPE GANG from A Clockwork Orange is ok?
I wish you can dislike a video more than once
Fun fact: 2:10 LeBron and Wade Miami Heat Reference
Ready Player Toon
This is so funny.Like Lebron and his game.Funny.Child in big athletic body.Nothing more.He is perfect fit to this movie.Funny 😃.MJ in SJ wasn't good idea.Still the first space jam was better not even watching Lebrons.Why?MJ is the GOAT 😃
I knew god was black
That’s pretty much the whole movie
I have no idea about the history of this but man this is going to be a jam
One thing I don't get why don't they stick to older animation it would look much better
This will be nowhere near as good as the first one
ngl the trailer felt bit cringe
Poor lebron so oppressed
I'm surprised there hasn't been a Mao reference yet.
Pepe Le Pew has been cancelled but you have a Pennywise easter egg in there. He killed kids and gay people. Hope he gets to play in the spacejam too!
trash
New Space Jam coming out: "WHAT IN THE MATRIX HELL!?!?!"
Space jam at 5.
Gee, Pepe Le Pew would have added SO MUCH to this movie!!  /s
Nice:)
I'm boycotting this film because of the lovely bad acting!! #RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Am I the only one person who saw Pennywise? Its on 1:46
Who tf actually enjoyed this trailer? That line delivery when lebron said "what in the matrix hell?" is god awful, just because you bring a famous basketball player, doesn't mean he knows how to act...
I'm not going to see the movie because of what you've done to lola bunny, today everything bothers you and how you've modified it by feminist critics, to be seen by feminists
Looks really bad
Absolutely love it, just wish Lola looked OG, not baggy and looking like a grandma.
Big Chungus confirmed @ 2:05
Man KONG just wanted to rest after he got clapped by Godzilla but nope now he gotta Hoop too?  Damn
Tron legacy + pixels + ready player one = space jam 2
He's also a good actor on the basketball court.
2:10 Me: *I love this movie already*
This is everything I wanted when I was 8
I watched a Babylon Bee video. I then had to come back to the trailer, and Holy S! If you pause at 1:46, you can see Pennywise in the far right of the screen.
In the most LeBron James quote ever..."We need to assemble an All Star squad!" LOLOL
No.
Lola :(
#restorethesnyderverse
skip
I feel like this is another one of those trailers that showed all the good parts of the movie... and I mean ALL. That's it, that's all there is. Like I'm pretty sure you didn't have to show granny going all BA, that could have remained a secret little gem for the audience to discover when they watch it for the first time.  A trailer is supposed to be an intro to the plot and no reveal on how it ends, and no reveal of any little gems.
why is he doing space jam he always eanted Jordan's legacy even though he won on paper he never did take his original Cleveland lineup to win a championship he had to move around to many teams, unlike Jordan who stayed with the same team and won the most in his twilight years
how many characters you want in this movie? WB : yes.
Looks fucking awesome
I'm A Cartoon? (01:10)
Main hero's actoric playing is awful i hate hes playing
How about come up with some new ideas for movies instead of trying to cash grab off old ideas. At least get ANYONE BUT LEBRON
*tHiS iS gOnNa Be So AwEsOmE!!!!!!!!!*
They’ve got a Game Of Thornes world!!!! 0:35
LeBron : "Dracarys"
Just more proof that Lebron will never be as good as Jordan.  This movie looks like PC trash and there's a 0% chance of me watching it.
I really wish they give tribute to Michael Jordan. He's the OG Space Jam. It would be cool if Bugs would say "What happened to Michael?" Then LeBron would be like "Michael who?"  And then you hear Michael's voice from behind say, "I'm the greatest player of all time"  The theater would go nuts!
You know the original was a dumb hour-and-half commercial, but it was genuine about being a dumb hour-and-half commercial.  This just screams "try hard". From the plot of kidnapping the son, who's not getting along with his father, to the Clockwork Orange and other cameos, and especially the freaking Inception-horn-laden "dark and edgy" remake of the Space Jam main theme, which was cool precisely because of how jammable it was. Seriously Hollywood, STOP SHOVING THE INCEPTION HORN IN THE TRAILERS! It's really irritating.
Space Jam: Big Chungus

Yikes indeed.
Give us our thotty back
Ryan Coogler's a GENIUS!!!!
Pepe le Pew out, the Droogs in, Droogs out, Droogs in with their yarbles viddying the bitva between the shoomny toons.
Is this how War Machine spent his downtime after mourning Tony Stark's death? Really?!
Ruining the widely beloved Looney Tunes characters 25 ago obviously wasn't enough. No for whatever reason WB has to give them the final death blow...
So, you remove Pepe for r*** culture, but you leave actual r***sts in?? (Droogs, 2:23) Hypocrites!!
Looking like a double-wide surprise. GODAYUMMM.
Lebron you'll never be Jordan ...am sorry
This really is the worst timeline
Bronny James punching the air rn.
Why Does The Kid Sound Like He's From The Thundermans

Of course the Granny is a neo nazi white supremacist sporting the Hitler number 88.  Seriously, does no one at Warner Bros. research that number, or does Warner Bros. believes Black Lives Don't Matter?. I mean what the actual hell.
Why does lola look like that
I love it
02:30 this is so bad. so old-school means just kicking the basketball? sorry grandma, no points.
China approves this message.
Lola Bunny did the D Wade assist in 2:10 lol
Obviously not better than the original but I’m so excited for this
Iam so proud of lebron he is a legend.
Why would you do that? Original is original, this is just stupid copy
#restorethesnydercut#
If you close your eyes you can really enjoy the soundtrack.
da fuck did you do to Lola
Michael Jordan & the Looney Tunes are victorious against the Monstars!!!!!  A quarter century later,Michael passes the torch to the unassuming LeBron James.  Lebron: What in the Matrix Hell?  (Woman singing)WELCOME TO THE SPACE JAM!!!!!!
ngl this look surprisingly good
the d wade reference got me in tears
PURE EPICNESS!!!!!!
I have my doubts
lebron makes a great actor....super Talented
Holy shit my 6 year old self is gonna be happy af

Conflicted. Still holding the original to heart
Weak
ew
Kong. My guy. You GOTTA train for your fight against Godzilla. You don't have time to watch basketball games
I will throw and drop kick children out of the way to see this movie
Raedy player one sequel looks ok.
Ready Player Two: Looney Tunes  Lol
a couple of seconds into the trailer and the acting is terrible
It looks good, anyone hating suffers from narcissistic nostalgia complex.
Age 27 and I'm in there !
Pretty good trailer will be watching in theaters for sure.
woah i have a gra nny fetisg
Just leave it alone! The first was a classic this looks terrible, Coming To America 2 is anything to go by this will be the same!
Nostalgia every time
#Restorethesnyderverse
Ide rather see kevin durant as the main basketball star, and Steph Curry as co- star Would be much more entertaining. Lebron James role in space jam 2 doesn't fit at all
It would have been way better if they did it with Kobe instead of Lebron
I guess Godzilla couldn't find time in his busy schedule to come watch the game. Too busy doing 👑 things.
*"A New Legacy"* F-cking lame.
Yeah, this is just *"Ready Player One: Warnerverse"* How lame that after all this time they couldn't make this right.
Movie ain’t even out and it’s already a flop.
Looking forward to this movie
Should've made Ready Player Two instead of this.
Guys, imagine the hype if Michael Jordan made a cameo and the two went one on one!
eh
So not hyped at all Michael Jordan wanna be smh it’s really not that cool at all anyway
2:22 this is awkward....
What in the matrix hell?!
Hong Kong Phooey is in Space Jam a New Legacy

1:46 you’ll float too 🎈
The fact that ppl are talking about this                But u never seen the trailer until now like smh
He is not the new Michael Jordan
Here's another thing that lebron can't do as good as Jordan, act, add it to the super long list boys. So the only thing lebron does better than the GOAT Jordan is defend china I guess. Also, did the Quad City DJs  work on this version, or did they let you destroy their iconic song for a paycheck?
Oh, I'm so looking forward to seeing this movie in theaters when it arrives... I loved the first one with Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes.
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
looks awful
i am highly disappointed
Michael Jordan: And I took it personally...
wtf is this ?
Lol, why am I seeing Alex and his droogs from A Clockwork Orange in this trailer? Seriously, what in god's name are they doing here???
HBO Max taking over 🔥🔥🔥
#ListenToFaceJam
Alright. Aside from the Pepe Le Pew bullshit their pulling (And it is without a doubt bullshit that no one can deny as we get the bloody Droogs from Clockwork Orange appearing in this and they were rapists in their bloody movie). It would be sick if it was a Basketball tournament with all sorts of mixed characters playing against Lebron and the Tunes.
This man got King Kong on his team 🤣🤣🤣 even in movies he cheats 😭😭😭
20k dislikes in the Space Jam 2 trailer. I have no clue how you people pulled it off, but you managed to actually get people to dislike Space Jam. This is gonna bomb.
Wonder when Michael is going to take this personally....
Who cares about godzilla vs Kong I want me some space jam
Granny by Robot Chiken 😂
We sure this isn't Ready Player 2?
Lola Bunny, my first love.
Here comes the lola bunny rule 34
“This is the Ultimate Showdown!”
#restorethesnyderverse Give us our Snyderverse back bitches
Can we have Pixar animate Lola
Toonpur ka superhero😂
Huh Lola straight I’ll bite
Gotta admit, the part where Iron Giant comes in, I get goosebumps. Idk why. I just do. The combination of the music and Iron Giant stepping in is too much for me, for some reason.
I swear if they get rid of Michaels secret stuff and they put LeBron James going like get that out of my face
yabba DABBBA DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
This looks fucking abhorrent
Kong 🤔🤔🤔
This IS Going to be the best warner bros cartoon movie by the crossovers!!
Michael Jordan is a better actor as well
I guess they need King Kong to 1v1 Godzilla in Basketball.
On the plus side for the movie, I'm glad that they kept the traditional animation in the film for the looney tunes. That makes me really happy.
shame that Pepe isn't in the movie. All the more reason why people need to learn to separate what's real from fiction.
Garbage
Michael Jordan is still the 🐐
So, no Pepe, but we have a cameo from the Droogs of Clockwork Orange, who are quite literally r*pists... WTF WB?!?!!?
I'm really hoping Tom & Jerry make a cameo in this movie
25 year later after the first one
Bro this won’t beat MJ’s space jam, it may be better graphic wise but it being LeBron makes it the dollar general version space jam.
Give us back Lola's big naturals
1996:Watch on Video Tape, with my mon 2021:Watch on Youtube, with my daughter
I know space jam was based back in the day for a number of reasons but I hope we're not gonna act like they didn't just put the guys from clockwork orange in the bg cheering on bugs bunny
This trailer is sick
I'm in been long enough
👏🏾👏🏾
Isn't this Space Jam 3?
Warnerverse confirmed?
BIG CHUNGUS PLS
y Pepe Le Pew???? >:(
just a michael jordan cameo oh god please
Cancel Pepe le pew!   But keep the Droogs! Hahahahahahahaha
Anyone name the characters you see in the crowd, 1:43 Flintstones, yogi bear, king Kong  1:47 megamind  2:17 the mask 2:23 Scooby Doo 2:32 robin
I just caught wind that Pepe Le Pew won't be appearing due to "normalizing rape culture" cry babies. big sad...
So no body gonna mention the dank ass game of thrones world?!?
triste dia pros canceladores
I bet bronny felling some type of way 😂
Main takeaway: girl Bugs is still hot.
he replaced bronny
Certain films should only remain in remembrance, this is one of them.
Spoiler: He saves his son. Saved ya $12
Why didnt they bring back the monstars? It would be nostalgia for people who watched the 1st movie, and new people will see them. I hope their will be a transformation sequence in the film where the new nerdlucks transform into the goon squad.
This movie looks great
Too much 🥴
Did anyone recognize the Nike logo in the cartoon lebron scene
They should have a 3D Kobe coming as a hero for LeBron. But that’s my opinion
I dont thing, I want this!!
im not the only one that saw the SMALL FOOT YETI'S!! right??
Easy to social distance when all the actors are cartoons.
How come Pepe LePew was removed for supposedly adding to rape culture (which is ridiculous as we're talking about fictional stuff here, but w/e), but cameos of a gang of literal rapists from A Clockwork Orange are present?  What the heck is this absolute and ridiculous nonsense, lmao?
SO  MJ  VS  JAMES    HUHH  WONDER WHO GOT THE BETTER HALF OF THE  MOVIES LOL  SO ALIENS  KNOW MYTH MOSTERS N GODS
HAAAA  WAR MACHINE
This version will never beat the other one, because the other one have a Legend.
Monstars are still better....just saying
Should of starred a basketball player who isn't a polarizing, egotistical punk arse
The court Turn out Op!
Thank you WB for removing such a  horrible character as Pepe la pew and including cameos of such wholesome characters like rapist and murderers!
Jack Nicholson's Joker: 1:52
Jordan + Murray
They butchered lola!! #bringbacksexylola
#CONTINUETHEMONSTERVERS
This looks so bad
The screwed up the goon squad
why is tune world the rejects?
Why no Pepe Le Pew but instead Rapist Droogs from Clockwork Orange?  Shame on you for being so ignorantly woke in the wrong way WB!
I'm 17, but I feel much older seeing all these characters from old fairy tales (cartoons), I miss those childhood years ...
Damian Lillard playing the lead Villan actually makes sense in that he's the most feared clutch-time player in Basketball these days! ❤️
It’s not space jam unless the GOAT himself makes into the movie. Ruining my childhood. Should’ve had Michael in it for at least a scene or two. Or at the very least at the ending.  Hope this generation can enjoy it though. Brought back memories. Greatest childhood movie of all time!
He ain't no Michael 👎
Garbage.
This is either gonna be really good, or it's gonna reeeeeeally suck.
Guys pause it at 2:24 and you'll see the Droogs from Clockwork Orange
This looks really good I am hoping to see this moive and they say that have zendaya in space jame 2
We just gonna gloss over that they spelled "toon world" as "tune world"?
Kobe would be proud of you 😔
90‘s babies ASSEMBLE
Oh my God I'm a kid again! 😄
U want king kong on your team,, yall not see the movie💀
bronny punching the air rn
I felt like a kid watching this 😂😭 I never watched the first one but ill watch this.
Lebron James is a cartoon??? 1:05
Inb4 they replace this trailer with a new one without the rapists from “A Clockwork Orange”

Wait so the plot seemed like it started off as the son not wanting to do basketball and wants to do his own thing, the ends up being kidnapped and needs to be rescued? Ahhh let’s waste money to get my burning questions I guess
Is this just ready player one, but with looney toons and basketball
Would have been amazing if they had Allen Iverson “A.I” as the artificial intelligence ;)
i just realize there using the same model of kong and the iron giant from ready player one
Why are they’re pop culture references? This looks horrendous
If Lola Bunny has a flat chest then i DEMAND that Granny gets the same treatment
Pure trash
I prefer the original because its just classic and kinda better
i love this so much
Zendaya
Warner bros I exploded that I saw the Animaniacs  Edit: What I meant of me exploding, is that I was overhyped that I saw them and I was a little fan of them
This looks lit
Man looking at Lolas new design I have to say I think I like it more than the original until they show her in 3D yea the design doesn't look as good
No Pepe but a Real Rape Gang from another Movie " Clockwork Orange " Y makes sense 🤣🤣🤣 fu ridiculous
The guy kidnaps his son and will only get him back is if he plays basketball?  This can't all be the plot? There's something they not telling us
Why remix the space jam song?  It's as classic as the loony tunes intro.
This looks cute. I hope the KIDS who the movies is for enjoy it and their nostalgia ridden parents don't make a big deal out of this updated sequel.
Another movie ruined
Going to be honest. Look kinda mediocre
"Keep making stupid shit and people will keep not watching it" ~ Someone with a brain.
Easy skip - looks terrible
2:31 when granny lands you can see old school Robin and possibly batman on the right front row. Also tin man? And someone who almost looks like vin diesel in bloodshot lol I have no idea who that is.
God i hope this doesn't suck.  It kinda looks like its going to.  God i hope they dont push stupid agendas. God the kid in me needs this to be great.
Pause at 1:46 it’s pennywise
[2:10] Anyone else catch the reference to the famous D Wade assist to LeBron picture? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xLoBNK048Y
So fantastic!!! Great
The trailer is kino, with that being said i dont need to watch the whole damn movie, the trailer already fullfilled my soy nostalgia kinks tbh, thanks btw.
*I like da remix, What's the remix name?*
🤮🚽
How about you #RestoreTheSnyderVerse  ?
I'll just preemptively dislike this
Why is nobody talking about how bad Lebron’s acting is. My goodness, it’s terrible.
(1:43) Animaniacs!
Ok, Ok i cant stop watching this, it looks so good, like a mix of endgame and ready player one! I cant wait for this
James is like James Rhodes from iron man and he is same actor lol
1:25 damn he really blicked him
🤯😂😂
Ready Player Two already looks awesome!
LeBron James? Acting? (excuse me if I mixed up my basketball people)
Ayee cartoon James look dope ngl. First one was a classic, finna watch it right now
Zack Snyder's space jam
John 3:16 “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”
This movie is going to be trash 🗑
Trash
2:10 got people drooling lmao
i wish they would've kept them 2d and not make their models 3d like in the old movie the characters stayed 2d while jordan was 3d.
Please put Daffy Duck the magician somewhere in the movie ;-;
Rhoedyyyyyy!
Warner Brothers: *Electric Boogaloo*
Looks like they tried to make this one funny. The first Space Jam was more serious. Hopefully the jokes on this one are not corny
I have so many feelings about this, and I understand none of them.
Jordan: Let's make a movie about NBA players and me in a cartoon world Lebron: Let's make a movie about me, myself and I.
maybe this is the evil Chon deadle, not don cheadle
I'm sorry don cheadle, but I don't think child slavery is a good image for you
1:44 and King Kong? all their missing is the delorean and than it's officially a rip off
That was great whens Space Jam 3?
1:40 they even have the iron giant, it is ready player one
is it me or does this feel like the emoji movie mixed with ready player one
1:44 King Kong just entered the universe.
why is don cheadle evil in this, he's too nice in real life
I saw the ThunderCats: Lion-O and Cheetara watching the basketball event at the end of the trailer! XD XD XD
I just wanted to come say how fake lebron james is. Keep buying his shoes that are made for a few dollars by children (the same age as yours or younger) in sweat shops overseas.
That's should be one of the Greatest crossovers ever!!!!
Ready Player One walked so this could Run
Dont waste your time with this ignorance
I'm waiting for that big chungus cameo
#restoretheSnyderverse
I BETTER see Mumble Happy Feet as the band, he's WB property too. Forget his sequel, at east he won an award! Sorry but I see no reason to leave him out.
All lives matter
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Ready player one, but make it basketball.
All conservative freedom lovers.  We must stand together against racism.   Lebron James is racist against our conservative views and only believes what he thinks is right.   We must not see, buy or even speak of this movie and tell all our friends to stand together. Stay away from this and movie.  MEXICANS FOR TRUMP 2024
Literally 99% of you won’t see this but I hope everybody had a good day and God bless you
I'll watch when Zack snyders justice league too...ok jk I'll probably watch this on hbo
LeBron will trade the Tune Squad members for Monstars players just to beat the Goon Squad.  Maybe, LeBron will join to the Goon Squad.  Just kiddin.
This promises to be a blockbuster of the summer.
Granny was a cheerleader in the first Space Jam, now she’s playing for the Tune Squad with LeBron James.
Will this be another ‘give it 10/10 or lose your job’ movie
Hope different franchises featured won't take too much attention from Looney Tunes characters
Jordan > LeBron??
“Huhuhu classic”  Me:🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Trash xD Oh Hollywood, when will you learn
1:33 Kong clapping!😆
How many times does he flop against the goon squad? 2-3?
I hated 1, probaly will hate 2...
NOW WERE TALKING
The ultimate Warner Bros. Crossover we have been waiting for! I hope they add some Cartoon Network characters as well...
Bron finna trade the toon squad for Goku, Vegeta and one punch man
Wack af
This is one Bizzare Isekai Anime
Damn this look next level for real
he said shoot the ball to a cowboy 🤦‍♂️ that's like saying go fish to a fish
They remade DWade and Bron iconic poster...
Its extraordinary bad. Another shitty movie by warner sisters.
They couldn’t use bronny?
I'm sorry but everytime someone in the comments has the abbreviation MJ Zendaya automatically comes to mind, and then I realized that they are talking about Michael Jordan.😁😂
So does he have a brother or is that teenage guy just always nearby?
Lebron: Space Jam 2!!  MJ: And i took that personally
Looks like a Wreck It Ralph knock off... like I’ve seen this. WHY DID THEY ANIMATE HIM?! THEY DIDNT ANIMATE MICHAEL.... and FUCK that 3D looking animation, I want my Loony Toons NORMAL. 🥺
This movie is either going to be worth every penny or one of the worst movies of all time. I don’t know which.
come on and run baby run, that part gets me so hyped, it takes me back to old one with mj
Not realistic at all. Lebron would've trade bugs bunny for better players.
Bro this movie going to be insane
there was a animaniacs easter egg so if there’s no animaniacs i’m going to be disappointed at that missed opportunity
Wait are the adults still simping for lola  lmao
I’m waiting for white mamba to intervene and save the world.
Why is she flat😔
This looks like it's gonna suck
Am i the only one that gets goosebumps when the guy says: serververse?  No im just weird? Ok...
sheeeeeeeeesh
No
Hadn't the movie Ready Player One come out yet (? Jajajajaj
warner bros be putting out some bangers recently...first the snyder cut then godzilla vs kong and now this
It’s so dense. Every single image has so many things going on..
TBH I'm in love with the first one this looks good to but the first one is the best for me
Kin kong
I am *so* ready for this!
0:00 I think I heard a Nintendo Switch sound
Here comes the "back in my dayy" boomers. Enjoy new innovation boys
I can't believe that they added king Kong the Flintstones iron giant and Scooby-Doo
#RestoreTheSynderVerse🔥🔥
Changing Lola Bunny was fine, boobs aren't everything. But now with the trailer, we see that it's a shit movie too. Great.
Oh boy. Can’t wait for Warner Bros Friendly Ready Player One.
I hope the space jam remix is as applicable as the first, that song can be mixed with anything
the wade to lebron refrence did it for me lol
This makes no sense. It’s absolutely wild and has little to no logic... and I am all for it!
Iron Giant in Space Jam?! OMG 😱😵🤖
RL GRIME YUSS MY MAN!
The biggest cross over since endgame
I really thought gandalf would be on his team, very dissapointed D:
Kid: you just never let me do me  Lebron: And I took that personally
Zack Snyder's space jam
I just know this film is gonna bring back so much nostalgia while also being it’s own individual classic that will be just as entertaining as the last one.
my reaction to this trailer: 2:15
Wonder of godzilla's in its
Is this reminding anyone else of Thor ragnarok
#restorethesnyderverse
People just haiteing because it’s Lebron in my opinion I think trailer pretty dope😂 but if it was Steph curry insted everybody would love it and that’s facts
Cartoon Network
I’m looking forward to this
https://youtu.be/catRcszB6Mw
I am not watching this shit movie
2:26 how could I forget this old lady
*wack*
Are the looney toons gonna kneel?
Lame.
Going to be a shitty movie 😂
Just came here to see pennywise 1:46
Why couldn't you just left space jam alone, the 2d animation isn't great quality, the 3d is kind of uncanny valley, the 1996 movie isn't great quality but it has lots of charm. watching this trailer just hurt.
1:41 why is Drogon on here??? 🐉
Lebron: your a lousy kid! I wish Jaden smith was my son!
i was skeptical about going to see this but once i saw a dragon and Kong in the trailer it became the only thing on my calender
SHOULD OF BROUGHT MJ BACK!! LBJ CAN'T ACT FOR 💩💩💩💩💩!!!
Warner Bros: “Boom! You lookin for this?”
The walking dead girl and new star trek
I WANT BIG CHUNGUSSS
"This place reeks of corporate shame."
Doesn't matter They ruined lola bunny
did anyone ask for these  wnba players..?
Marvel: We got the Multiverse coming together Lebron mf James: Serververse
of course fluffy is speedy gonzales 😂😂😂
Lol in Astartes, they Space Marine squad fell into the same sphere...
Omg the Nostalgia when hearing that theme remix...
they should have put bryce james
1:41 so  this is where Drogon went at the end of Game of Thrones... ^^
What they done to my homie space jam. I’m sorry they done you dirty like this. You’ll always be in my thoughts. Rip little homie! You’ll be missed by many
NBA ratings crashing so Lebum needs to pick up an acting role 🤣🤦🏻‍♂️
Lol this looks freaking awful.
Given the hammer/sickle ☭ seal of approval from the CCP to the NBA.  Absolutely nothing offensive to the regime.
I like how Bronny's just sitting courtside like he's not on ransom or anything
trash cashgrab
Then next space jam should be with Tom Brady in football and then like 25 years later do Mahomes
Ready player one"2"?
Wow, this looks like absolute trash. Kinda rough considering how large the first one looms in many hearts
Quebreeeiiiiiii
Not sure if it’s the low expectations I had going into this, but this trailer isn’t bad! I’m actually kinda hyped now for the movie to come out.
#ReastorTheSnyderVers
I hope there is a Bill Murray cameo.
Man, they better not ruin the old one. Because if they do I’ll sue them
Poor Don Cheadle
Yeah bullshit.👎
Low tier garbage. Not once did they show the real world LeBron James interacting with a drawn character. It's CGI so there's no effort required.
Yeah, I’m sure an ancient demigod who feasts on children would check out a random basketball game 🙄
STAWP IT!
Iam really wonder how Hollywood  directors gets such unique story ideas....thats the reason that no Wood cannot comes even closer to Hollywood...
god I dont need an hour and a half of 'Hey, look at all the IPs we bought over the course of our prolonged existence', especially in a childrens movie.
#restorethesnyderverse
I’ve never seen the original but this looks neat
If the original goon squad doesn't make some sort of appearance I will be thoroughly disappointed
The thing is I watched space jam every time I was at my pop pops house and since they are releasing another movie, ima re watch this over and over and over again
Mans didn’t even cast his real wife and son
I think I am gunna ..... 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
0:32 I like this part
Jordan is even the better actor😂🐐
Why isn’t this in Chinese ???
WOKE JAM
Wait so they aren’t stealing anyone’s talents in this one?! 🥺
The sound when he entered the Looney Toons world was amazing and incredible hah a
can i just say the space jam music remix sounds amazing
Nope not for me  the movie is too busy way to much cgi I will stick with the original with mj
Why is trailers are actully better than the movies? Hope that this be good.
What to fuck this is going to give me epilepsy
They should named it Ultimate space jam
The fact that this is a sequel that doesn’t look like crap makes me kinda happy
I was a little nervous about this movie, but it looks like a lot of fun.  Of course, I was going to see it either way.  But the trailer really did it's job and raised my excitement level.
Movie 1: Cartoons in Real Life  Movie 2: Humans in Cartoon World
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
No thanks Lebron
Warner Bros just keep revealing too much in their trailers, I feel like I watched the whole movie after this one.
Wow~~~~
What a tolerant film, so many black actors ... probably the film will collect billions because it is so trying to please the trends. There is no plot, there is a bright attraction. And why a good plot, when people will go to the film anyway, because it is so bright and will give their money to the studio. There are no white actors, but they will not be offended by this, and if they are offended, what will they do?
Alex from Clockwork oranage,  a rapist, can be un Space Jam 2, but Pepe Lepew can't (he Is rejected cause he stinks, when he wears perfume, he gets chased by the same cat who ran from him). Well done Warner.
10 year old me *IS HYPE AF.*
What is King Kong doing there he just lost to Godzilla
No 😣
This looks like a total rip off no shame
I hope Dan Aykroyd is in this movie
Where is big chungus???!?!?
Michael  Jordan  to lebron James this is something
I'm sure it'll be CCCP approved. LeBum is genocidal, concentration camp, bio weapon China's best friend and fan.
So..  did they forget they were making a basketball movie halfway through?
Warner Bros A new legacy
Wow.....stupid as hail.....not even close to the og......way to ruin something that could have been amazing......absolutely trash
#restoresyndercut
Lol idk bout this one don't ruin t space jam like they did Lion king and Mulan
why not just let bronny play his son??
So the 'Droogs' who are actually rapists and murderers are a better look than Pepé Le Pew?? Who's decision was it to include characters from A Clockwork Orange in this children's movie??
I grew up watching the first space jam and now there a second one and I can’t wait for this
Loving the homage paid to the original... even down to the stiff acting from Lebron. Michael Jordan must be so proud.
Every generations new Michael Jordan is required to make a space jam
2: 03 chungus??
-Lola bunny given the same body of Bugs -Peppy canceled for being rapey but they have clock work orange characters shown -Lefraud Shames is a China communist shill -lame 3D animation instead of the classic hand drawn  -plot looks like Ready player one aka LOOK WE REFERENCE A BUNCH OF CRAP THAT HAS NO IMPACT on story
Wow this is gonna suck major balls
w o a h
Wouldn’t be a Disney movie without a kidnapping
I can’t wait to see it and i hope I see MJ
1:24 so....canceled cartoons are ok 👌 as long as they have a China 🇨🇳 representative like  LeBron James... #cancelReboots #CancelNBA #CancelHollywood #Cancel2021 #CancelDemocrats
2:23 The Night King..
I dont see anything wrong with how they entered toonworld in the first spacejam. Why they gotta go and alien technology the magic on me :*(.
No rush?
Jesus Christ is coming soon brothers and sisters repent and accept him as your Lord and Savior...The Great Tribulation is upon the world dont love the world or the things in it  for it will perish away but look unto God for eternal salvation of your soul through Jesus Christ I plead with you with love for time is shorter than you think!! Get right today Only through Jesus Christ can you save your soul.
1:45 if he’s here where’s Godzilla
King James👑🔥
Looking cool. I'm just angry they basically showed everything cool in those two minutes, so there is nothing to be lokking forward in the movie.
were is lola,s big naturals ?????????
Wait a minute, if this has every Warner bros properties. Is it possible we can find Big Chungus in this movie.
I expected nothing yet I'm still disapointed.
imagine GARRY'S MOD YOGI BEAR in YOUR pantry, eating YOUR food
Iron Giant 🥺
If it’s not the MJ one I’m not watching #PERIODT
LeBron James..... *echo* LeBron James...
😂😂😂✌❤
no ta en epañol que mal
Hope this movie doesn't flop...or Lebron.
Hhyghyhuyhyhyguiuutfgjghhhuiootrsssr welsh Powells to the right to change the color you are ydyyy0
At 2:07 Behind Penguin it looks like Mr. Freeze. And a MIB agent next to them. And Willy Wonka to the left of The Mask.
Let's be real. The original Space Jam was an instant classic that probably should have won some Academy Awards for its gripping storyline and stellar acting. It's hard to put out a sequel of similar caliber when the first one was near perfect.
This is a movie for me and i already watch the first Space Jam i can wait to see this movie I'm so excited
YOOOOOO LETS GOOOO
“We need kong,the world needs him”
"You never just let me do me"  Oh boy if he had african parents
Where's the thicc 乁( •_• )ㄏ
Yeah this looks like total dogshit
'Sam shoot the ball'  You didn't think this through Duffy
Fire
Hey LeBron how bout you go live in China since you love supporting communism so much and love shting on the patriots of your own free country fu
As much as I like LeBron there is no reason for this movie to exist. None
#restorethesynderverse
1:21 there is a mistake in yosemite's data, it says he is a rooster, maybe it was supposed to be Foghorn Leghorn?
This shit needs to stop.
#restorethesynderverse
#restorethesynderverse
Lord save use from this horrible looking movie. The OG is for sure better the story sounds weeeeekk
Russian translation is terrible!  change urgently !!!
seriously they made this ohh smh
Can't wait yo watch this brooooo
I QUIT SMOKING THANKS TO THIS CMMERCIAL
And that’s a pass on seeing this.
Like to me I feel like they just exposed the whole point of the movie like now I know that he is going into a world and is gonna spend the whole movie on finding just the right people but that’s just me
LBJ used to be left hand to write but in the film he use right hand
so hyped
Warner brothers please release Godzilla v kong and mortal kombat in Nepal☹🤞.
Have you ever seen CGI as crazy as this?! Not me. But just you wait. Movies will be almost all CGI in the future because the world “isn’t cool” anymore. I think Warner Bros should create a realistic/non realistic movie in Hawaii. Like film in Hawaii but add in CGI that makes it a LITTLE too unreal. By the way I’m just 12 years old and I think anyone would think that would be cool. Who’s with me?
I hated it until I saw don cheedle
I like it👍
It's just what we wanted!! THE DROOG'S IN A SPACE JAM MOOVIEE!!!! WB, HOW DIDD YOOUuUu KKNnOwwWw?!?!?!?
Well at least part of the movie has the more "original" animation for the toon squad.
@1:46 why is pennywise in this?
I'm sorry but how did we go from MJ to LeBron?
1:24 don't mind me just leaving a shortcut
_China has joined the chat_
so anyway, I started blasting
Smh they should’ve just put lebrons son in this bith
Yep seeing that
This is LIT
This guy is so "brave" that say nothing about freedom of speech and the violence of HONGKONG policies. Even ask Daryl Morey to keep silence. He is a  coword who only "brave" for money and power, not for faith and human rights. I won't pay anything for this coword's movie asshole.
I am not a being rude, but I saw a Black man from Avengers (not the bearded one) And I saw him really totally impregnate Kristen Bell and other women in House of Lies
Hi If you saw my comment, you will die
Steaming pile of cinema...downloaded by LeBong Dranes.
Bron really goat wow
Not watching or supporting a movie that stars an anti-white, ultra racist like LeBum James.
I didn’t understand a thing cuz i just saw the game of Thrones world, and i want them to make this movie🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can't beat Jordan might  as well do everything he has except win 6 rings!
So basically it's Ready Player One but they play basketball
Kong what
#RestoreTheSnyderverse     #ReleaseTheAyercut
I came, I conquered, and disliked this video. The concept is horrible.
Damn, war machine’s mental state really went down after tony died, he’s now sending Lebron James to a cartoon world
Why the fk is in tune ... carTOON ... am I in the ring universe??
WTF HAPPENED TO LOLA???? YALL INSECURE PEOPLE MAKING PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR CHARACTER TO “fit the correctness” 🤡
So WB, Where is Big Chungus?
'Member Chewbacca? 'Member Space Jam?
Ready Player One 2: The Space Jam
LETSSS GOOOO!!!!!
Scooby doo !!!!!!!!!!!
No. Just no. This is garbage.
Pls tell me they still have micheal strong stuff
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Look at granny man
Did I see a Sergios? Right after Iron Giant.
Forget the goon squad. I want the looney tunes vs the Hanna barbera all-stars.   Eh maybe that’ll be the spin off: Laff-a-lympics
Ready Player 2.
If these are the best parts of the movie, I don't want to see the rest.
Yes everything is coming out smooth so far now either could be good as the first space jam and legendary movie ready player one or could be a total flop
Ya'll reaching hard with this one
1:39 *THE IRON GIANT,ITS THE IRON GIANT* -proceeds to pass out-
You guys know that this guy kneels during the national anthem, right?
What should we do to update the soundtrack? Every modern remake/sequel : Let’s slow it down and make it more dramatic.
Do not want.
War machine 😎
I love Warner bros Respect from Kosovo Republic ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
watching this just makes me want to watch the original space jam not this one
"He's fixing a divot!"
When I saw those other nostalgia cartoons I flipped
LeBron James is nothing compared to Michael Jordan  !  Michael Jordan is on a much higher level !
This is gonna be ridiculous and I'm gonna enjoy every minute of it lool
Ghg
Are we getting the snyderverse in this serververse?
Let’s gooo
This looks great, busted that Newman from Seinfeild isn't in this
Are you getting the BLM massage yet? 🤮🖕
Not a single white person to be found
Man, Ready Player Two looks fun.
It's not like there weren't attempts over the years. Back in action was made with the idea looney tunes shouldn't have to rely on a basketball novelty to stay relevent
Prepare your Sprite Cranberry for LeBron James' new Space Jam movie.  *If only it's still available
Every movie written and directed by black people: "Give me back my son!"
Oh no. It's happen again.
If anyone says this looks better than the 1st one MJ will take it personally and give em 60.
🔥🔥
Wow a black person
FREE HONG KONG
That looks awful.
This looks terrible
I love Space Jam Basketball movie❤🏀.
The mystery machine
So is this a reboot or a sequel? Really looks like nothing from the original movie ever happened. I prefer the original storyline where the toons (ugh "tune" squad) world existed tight alongside the 3d world. Like a who framed roger rabbit or bonkers like thing.
No last no
Whaatt this looks awesome tho
i still prefer the Old Space Jam, nice try though..
Fun Fact: Everything owned by Warner Bros is going to be portrayed in this film which is pretty lit because it's like a anniversary.
Won’t be better than the original
KD: why not me here?
Too much CGI and not enough heart.
If you never watched space jam 1 when it first came out then you have no right to watch this one
I’m just happy watching this.
A cardboard cutout of MJ is still a better actor then James.
*This does.. put a smile on my face.~*
So I guess what I''m trying to say is.
*Times like these make the pain all worthwhile, and just a little more bearable each day.*
Wow!!
What happened to her chest
I'm not watching this look what they have done to my sweet lola bunny
#RestoreTheSnyderverse
Rewatching the original space jams to prepare
I hate the animation design for lola and some of the other characters but my god it looks decent

I know 99% won’t care but I hope everyone stays blessed and safe during these times. I’m struggling to reach 1k 💔😔
I don't think I'm like this.
Man Lola bunny got me bricked up😩😩
it doesn't look that bad tbh
Shake it quake it space kaboom!
Where's Pepé??
It looks fire 🔥
Just love and respect to LBJ, a movie to enjoy despite a messy world.
This is not like the original first space jam with Michael Jeffrey Jordan!  The G.O.A.T. just not the same! There can be only one! :) Even in the movie Lebron wants to bring in superstars because he's just not MJ! Chasing superstars and chips...
MJ is a better actor than LeBron
laaaaaaaammmmeeee
Who's here because of Yoongi ✋
Was anybody asking for another space jam film
Bruh that was deadass a remix of Ready player one 😂😂
Sick
LeBron haters watching this expecting him to be this phenomenal actor.       Stop it, get some help.
Lets be honest If lola was as thiccc as before twiter would had trown a tantrum
Looks crap should be cancelled
1:45 i guess this apart of the monsterverse now
I'm 39 and this movie looks 100 times better than the original LBJ is the GOAT!
I don't know whether to cringe or not.
2020 was hard for everyone. Happy 2021. Hope it will be better for you who is reading this :)
I'm not so sure on this 😂 cant beat the original, but i will watch it no doubt
This movie looks like absolue garbage already
19k of you disliking because you're simping over a cartoon rabbit and can't handle that they de-sexualised her wtf
Space Jam 1 = Indoor Stadium  Space Jam 2 = Street Basket
Trash just like lebum
why does lola bunny look like pinnochio .
Jordans space jam will all ways be better
I was liking it, then it went full 2d, so I started hating it. then it wen''t cgi, and I'm back to liking it!
Will it have Winnie the Pooh partying with Lebron? ;)
well we got what we wanted XD
Looks lame, over CGI, the story-driven looks typical cliche about some snowflake who doesn't want to do what his dad says, putting an iconic character in the background just to wheel in people, when in fact the character looks like some generic person cosplaying as the original. Space jam original is better.
💯🔥 Teaser Trailer
LeBron soo desperate to be MJ. Soo pathetic.
Wtf!?! What is this trash??
1:39 Ready Player One sequel looking hype
Looks so bad, Lola bunny was bad enough
Quackic like classic  Ha
Lola looking like a Lesbian 😭
HOT LOLA IS BACK!
It doesn't feel very Looney Tunes at all despite having Looney Tunes characters from what is shown here, but it is also a possibility that it just has a bad trailer. Slapping in characters from other franchises and the followers thing is kinda making me doubt only the trailer is bad.
Why are the Clockwork Orange Droogs on the sideline?
Garbage.
I'm have to pass on this one. The original is always better to me. Oh yeah! Lol. MJ > Lebron makes sense.
I feel like this movie is illuminated 😅 And there’s some illuminated in this movie. One eye.
LeBron - great basketball player - bad actor.
Lebron: im’a cartoon? Macauley Culkin: first time?
So Pepe Lew bad but Clockwork Orange Ok ya alright
Kong: *leaving hollow earth* Also kong: *sees billboard about basketball game*
Woah ... I really love that _Everybody's Circulation_ remix ...
Wanna sprite cranberry?
Don Cheadle as a villain is all I need in life
What the fuck did they do to lola bunny??
G T F O
So basically a huge Warner bros crossover?
this looks like an absolute cluster fuck. the animation looks worse than it did in the original. first movie was a cult classic, this one will be quickly forgotten.
Nah they nerfed my girl Lola bunny and made her and made her undummy  Thicc, I could’ve made her way better. No cap im a professional anime artist check my page @kingpapermario on insta for valid  proof
Any other basketball player and I’d be interested
WE NEED A IT 3
What a wonderful world
Space jam fortnite skins  Thank me later Warner bros
is this a joke?
I grew up with Space Jam just like everyone else here, and I can understand why a lot of them are so uncomfortable with a new one. But this looks amazing! I can't wait to see it!
They ruined it.
Should’ve kept it how it was 😔 but my dumbass still gonna watch it cause I’ve been watching the OG on vhs for along time n wanna see if it lives up to the hype
I only liked it because of the old lady 👵
ya i bet 80% of the movie is cartoon.
Assholes... this looks way too good.
Looks terrible
what happened to tweety's voice?
Can't wait🔥
Jordan should be playing don Cheetos part
Furries everywhere; "Look how they massacred my little girl, Lola!" (IF you compare to the original)
I better see a monstars cameo in this sequel

*Renai circulation wants to add another jam song for the meme*
Really sick
You know him as War Machine from the MCU so now Don Cheadle will be portrayed as a villain in this movie! Also seeing both 2d animation and CGI of the Looney Tunes will be Awesome!
Patch Notes: Lola Bunny has been nerfed-
Every one second a cameo😧
Damn this was a movie for kobe.,envy is a motherF...R.I.P KOBE you always gonna be 100 times better then lebron j.,my heart tells me that someone want it you away kobe n i always listen to my heart.
ok
Everything is Great but what happen with Lola Bunny?, she looks detailed but she don't have Knees
Ewww no.. MICHAEL JORDAN IS THE GOAT
It looks worse than I could have ever possibly imagined.
Wow this definitely looks like a Ready Player 2 movie and they are recycling characters from Ready Player One. Also saw Game of Thrones logo and possibly one of the dragons. Wtf? This is gonna be terrible.
damn... waiting😍
Where is big chungus?
When his son looks like a baby Zion
Trash
I've heard so much stuff about how good this trailer looks. . .it's terrible! This movie looks like it gonna be barely cohesive and just shit in general! I normally love this kind of crossover stuff but this just looks bad
Okay, that was weird but worth a shot
You all really just hating on the man. As a warriors fan all I can say is that I'm glad I'm not a butthurt manchild and I'm definitely going to enjoy this movie, it looks fucking awesome.
Let's see if "I Believe I Can Fly" by R Kelly is remixed. King Kellz💯😎👑
I love this! Just take all my money Warner Bros.!
Brings back memories
Are you shitting me lebrone james now
Since justice league didn't work for them I guess space jam is how WB is trying to  make another cinematic verse. So stupid.
Not even a single laugh while watching this, seriously this is a completly joke also they dont even show some respect to the old clasic 2D animation THATS WHAT THE MOVIE IS ABOUT!!!! NOT ABOUT CGI! YOU STUPIDS!! This world will not have more great cartoons cause they want to CGI everthing! Also they use shitless stupid jokes
Maybe it’s better then the trailer leads on
its stupid that the opposing team are robots instead of power stolen from other players
#restorethesnyderverse
Restore the snyderverse
Already pumped
LeBron is my favorite player since 2009, but this looks awful..
Doesn't look awful, but as a 90s kid from chicago you can guarantee imma hate on this movie
So Don Cheadle is basketball Jesus?
I like it
Lola looking different
am i the only one that loved the space jam remix
It’s Rhodey-
I think that one of the good things on the movie is that there are fire guns 😎
Hail King James
Y’all remember Lola in the first space jam🔥
Respect Lebron James as a Basketballer but he's not cut for acting. Looking forward to the movie thou. N hopefully this isn't the final trailer. Needs more editing.
I like how they made Quad City DJs Welcome to the Space Jam more dramatic.
thats not the lola bunny i remembered LOL
#nopepelepeworspeedygonzaleznospacejam
Meh 😕
I love that they let Pistol Pete keep his pistols. Love it.
Bring Back Pepe Le Pew On Space Jam 2 😞
Everybody gangsta until Granny makes her basketball moves 🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀
I can't believe that Lola Bunny was voiced by Zendaya😂
straight trash bruh tf
Garbage
Thanks for another terrible remake since y'all can't be original anymore.
Totally whack. This can't compete with or replace the Original Space Jam. Even this music is trash.
Just wait for Space Jam 3, where Kobe Bryant hast to play ball against a helicopter to save his daughter
This movie may just be the perfect fusion of new and old    Probably not but maybes
Hollywood back to ruin another classic
I’m the original Space Jam, the Tune Squad needed MJ to win. Here, Lebron needs the Tune Squad to save his son.
Zoomers watching this not knowing anything about looney toons
Well deserved Mr James....Well Deserved !
Seeing her in action I now realize why they changed the design... jiggle physics. They would've had to. So they eliminated the problem.
the editor paying em bills by fixing brons hairline
The franchise is ruined
This looks like fucking trash. The animation and cg looks terrible, the dialogue is stale and feels like it's written by an out of touch studio board team, and the lip syncing with the charactsrs is off. The production looks amatuerish. At least the original Space Jam is at least watchable in parts.
Omg did I see Drogon 🥺🥺
Bruh, I saw the Game of Thrones space world. Take me there.
I guess if your famous for whatever reason in the us, your an actor🤣🤣🤣
WHY ARE THERE THE FUCKING DROOGS IN THIS
I laughed at the bugs bunny part
What a disappointment 🤦‍♂️💯💯💯💯
Mehhh
i cant support this if lola bunny aint thicc as hell!
Wow 12M already
I was excited about this....was...it looks so terrible 😭😭😭😭😭😭
This already looks stupid.
So its Ready Player One all over again.
So you cancel Pepe Le Pew cause he’s too touchy but you have a cameo in this of the rapists from A Clockwork Orange? That makes zero sense.
It's official guys  You aren't the best basketball player of a generation until you are the MC of a Space Jam sequel
Who cares about Hollywood elites.
*WELCOME back TO THE SPACE JAM*
Let's not have them screw this up.
Wouldn't be surprised if this whole movie was just another Ready Player One Easter Egg.
I mean, everything looks good, except lebron green screen. It's so close!
Really really James, once again you guys f up a guaranteed money maker
Just like Ready Player One, this movie will have a LOT of hidden Easter eggs.
Cringeworthy acting 🎭
I actually want to watch this with My nephew💜
Ayo how tf did People come up with this shit
Player Ready 3. Plagiarism. Good one!
#RestoreTheSnyderverse
2:17 that is NOT Tweety's voice
Never knew war machine was talking to king james
Welcome to the space jam
Ahhhh what it’s coming out on my birthday!!! PERIOD🤪
Can't wait to download this on Piratebay
I'm so excited for the new movie. I cant wait to watch it !!! 🤩🤩
I cant wait for this movie
Animations soooo good
Ah so this is Ready Player Two?
I like the goon squad ideas/designs.But I miss the old Monstar designs
me: waiting for a sad kobe cameo
Wait why does this actually look good???
This is coming out on my birthday ....shit .
Wow that's war machine
Im gonna miss the Monstars lol
If the trailer isn't funny... ouch.
This will be great! I can't wait!
The problem is ...lebron can't act worth AF 😂
👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾 they messing with my childhood with this bullshit
space jam 2 pepe out, speedy out desexualize babs bunny but will put in "it" the clown who prayed on young boys and girls and other known violent killers to make up for it???!!!! the plot "if u play me in basketball I will give u your son back ??
Naaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Yo, did Lola bunny just do the D Wade, to Lebron oop?!!! The dope pic when they were both in Miami... 2:11
I'm a Lebron hater, but I wanna watch this "Ready Player Two" movie
I like how they randomly adapted a 2014 RL Grime trap tune for the background music
where's the mon-stars?
Yikes! I like MJ Space Jam. This new feels like Ready Player One and Tron Legacy mix. 😑 Btw, no Pepé Le Pew. :(
1:39 IRON GIANT!😆
I hate it already
Ready Player Two
Ready player Bron.
Of course the iron giant is there! That guy loves getting into these types of movies!!
Effectively, Gossamer has replaced Pepe le Pew.  And Beaky, Speedy and Marvin show no signs of appearing, either. This will definitely be a bad movie.
What in the "space jam" from wish type of shit is this?!?!?!
I'm wondering this though. Warner Bros did say that they would unleash their entire library on this film. But we saw Game of Thrones, which was part of HBO. And yet, they're here.   So of they're unleashing their entire library, does the same go for their acquired properties?
Hoping Godzilla Would Be here, But meh. We Got the Game of thrones dragon, And thats the closest thing to Big G.
Hi
Hi Warner Bros
When the world needed it most, the classic movie returned.
Looks like garbage 🗑
I down to see this yoy first Michael Jordan now Lebrun James my favorite basketball plAyer
The original is better.
while is good, i'm still sticking up with back in action...
This King Kong exactly looks like ready player one's King Kong
Braoooo....the acting chops is on point.
Pretty weak trailer tbh
Hard pass.
We want Jordan!
First MJ now Lebron....u know u made it in basketball when the loonytoons play ball with u😂
They really made no reference to jordan and his time with the looney tunes huh smh
Laborn  james
People of the internet: See how much they changed Lola?  Me: See how much they changed Big Chungus?
After what happened with Sonic it’s clear studios know how to make cartoon characters look good and realistic👍
Super Space Jam Ultimate
Welcome to space jam
Another movie no one asked for.
James < Jordan
This is the most important post you’ll ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Surrender your life to him now while you can, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... And as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
LeBron James  LeBron James  LeBron James!!!
What the fuck are droogs doing in this shit?
This movie could have all the cameos it wants, but nothing compares to The Monstars.
Crazy how bronny wasn’t in here😂😂
So we're gonna see the Iron Giant play basketball? It's better than Ready Player One I guess.
OMG THIS IS COMING OUT ON MY FREAKING BIRTHDAY
Omg
2:24 Holy shit, they actually DeLarge's gang rapists in this movie. I thought it was just an April Fool's joke.
Ight, had me sold at the "shoot the ball joke"
Am I the only one the caught the Nike logo shaped hole behind LeBron when he landed in Tune World?
2:22 .... hey let's give the kids the ra pe gang from Clockwork Orange.... that'll be fun 🙄
Damn Granny about to carry this team hard
this shit just might be good.
Trash
*_Cyber_* Space Jam
Warner brothers  character
Not watching it if Bill Murray doesn't do a cameo appearance.
What’s the fascination with a bunch of people from other franchises showing up in other movies. It’s not even that great imo. Ready player one kinda pulled it off well because you would expect that to exist in a video game, but bruh, why is the iron giant in space jam. Like come on
Whoever the dude that shot the ball is a menace
I'm here for the loonies, the scoobies and everything cartoonie not the bad acting from the homie.
Probably the best cgi of any looney tunes movie but it still doesn't do much justice
Kong 1:45
Wow... It seems impossible for Warner Brothers to create its own version of Wreck-it-Ralph 2!  Actually...
I watched my first game of nba in 10 years and it was extremely boring. What happened..
this is like a rip-off of several movies combined lol
No thanks
this music is on point!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mf Iron Giant LETS GOOOO
Movie looks like crap
This gives off Ready Player One vibes
So Ready Player one 2? Like why is the Iron Giant always being fucked around with in useless ways?
Despite 20 years of technology advancement and a larger movie budget, the 2D is somehow worse than the original Space Jam, and is only slightly better than the 1980's Looney Tunes.   How is it that 25 years after 3D movies like Toy Story, these 3D designs are so much uglier?   I don't care how many other Warner Bros properties you throw in the movie, this movie is an embarrassment.
no.   No.  NO.
I wonder how don cheaper feels callin lebron a clown without your armor. Wouldn’t you also be bad at bball cause of your back? BOOM YOU LOOKIN FA THIS
*How to Get Your Son*  Win a basketball match in Space.
My coach told me, don't force it.
No monstars
IT is in this movie. WTH is this gonna be
hm
Senior discount bruhhh
I love the CGI but cartoons look way better
Ok the goonsquad kind of looks lame compared to the monstars
man i love lebron
So it’s not gonna be like I’m a cartoon again it reset with a hole new plot
i thought it would be just looney tunes not the whole Warner bros.pitchures  characters like all of them all the minsters all cartoon characters and war macines actor..
Why use old cartoons  on a supposedly new legacy ? If the new  still values old then  I consider MJ God if lebron is ranked king now.
Ready player Bron
This..this is good. I like this
This movie gone change the world. Maybe even put us on better track. Lord knows the first one did.
That`s why kids never do drugs.
I don’t care about the other cartoon characters be 3-D the ones that I have for I just want to see me 3-D like the road runner and also Wiley coyote I’m so excited for this movie to come
This movie will never get a chance
I swear to God if they make CGI Big Chungus
this looks like ready player one but looney tunes
Godzilla vs kong
This is a lot to take in all at once but hey as long as there's an MJ cameo I'm all good

Who's the new dude at 2:10?
Imagine Lebron wins an Oscar... just put it with his Finals Trophys
1:57-1:59😁🙃🤣 I can't wait to watch this😱👏
Hopefully we’ll still be in lockdowns when this crap comes out
this is a kids film and has characters from A Clockwork Orange lmao
what a joke.   no thanks.
is this the new TRON movie?
Damian Lillard at 2:27
10 year old me wanted to go in this world
Another uninspired rehash money grab that completely lacks the spirit of the original IP.  This looks really bad.
sry but Lebron horrible at acting 😆
Why ruin a good thing?
So why are there droogs from A Clockwork Orange in here? 2:23 :x
GOAT
The Iron Giant made it feel more like Ready Player One than Space Jam in my opinion
No Pepe Le Pew but there is a Clockwork Orange 2:23
https://youtu.be/BPSVoGj7ex8
Dammn !!! This is making me go nuts 💯💯💯
This looks like a trash movie I've seen the original thousands of times and this one will be trash in comparison one mj better than lbj by far and two I don't need a two its going to flop because James is part of why the NBA is trash now days
Looks like crap
I saw scooby do there
I hope we see more ready player one movies and shows and ones like ready player one having all characters to together batting and cheering on the sidelines only thing missing is betting on witch to win
Warner Bros.: Where's Devon and Cornwall?
That's a CGI Lebron right?
well, kids now a day. don't know. who is the best cartoons like bugs, duffy and more :)
War machine?
“Eh, what’s up doc”? Literal chills
why make shitty movie like this, wat a waste of money, and the movie gonna be sucks, cus nobody as good as Jordan in 90s.
I like the Old cartoon references. but a little bit of Classic CN would had made it perfect
We got everyone here? Good, good. Now all we need is Stan. Where is that guy, anyways?
so like did the digital artist behind ready player one get stoned and think you know what we have all these tripped out assets lets repurpose them into a new movie?
omg so THIS is where drogon went
i dont know is just me but i think i saw in minute 2:23 The Droogs from Clock Work Orange So they kick out Pepe le Pew from the movie but they put these eeehhhhh good civilians from that movie
You would think LBJ would be a better actor with all the flops he takes
I feel sad for the younger generation having this as their space jam
Not a fan. They should’ve kept it to Looney Tunes, this doesn’t feel like Space Jam. It’s more easter egg diarrhea like RPO.
I actually shed a tear of embarrassment from how fucking stupid this looks.
Meh
A Clockwork Orange reference at 2:24 LMAO
Tf is this  ?
i like the dust from when he landed is a hoop also war machine that you
warner bros could have hired an actual sack of S H I t to act in this role instead went with the generic version LbJ   also why would they get someone not even top 50 of all time greats to star so many better players that dont rely on the refs putting them on the FT line 15-20 / game and anytime they need a score no player has ever been given the treatment this turd has
11 million views ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😀😀😀
a new legacy of being a l eftist  p o S   if only lebrons helicopter woulda went instead
Why don't they do the 2 of the Iron Giant? 😭😭
Can’t replace the mj version
i see scooby doo van
Lebron JAMES is a great man.  Looking forward to this very much.  I love LEBRON for many reasons but most of all for his philanthropy and charity to the youth of the nation and underprivileged communities.  He has kept his name clean from controversy and has been faithful to his long time wife.  Raised great kids.  LEBRON doesn’t get enough credit in this world of haters.  He’s a real role model for kids of today to look up to.  Glad they remade this with him.
is it justs me or does lola look hella weird?
Kobe should've been the one to do Space Jam 2 and not some cheap communist knock off wanna be MJ.
Loooking kinda whack
Crazy, I was 7 when the first one came out. My parents took me and now I'll be taking my kids to go see the sequel.
That music was 🔥🔥
I can't wait for this movie to come out
Why can’t they just use his real son
It would’ve been so cool if they did a MJ vs Lebron matchup. Not gonna lie though Lebron wants to be MJ so bad it’s crazy🤦🏽‍♂️😂
The reason i always pick MJ over Lebron is because i always feel like Lebron is trying to be MJ.
Jeff bergman: YES! they finally made a 2 one why they take so long?  Warner Bros: budget cuts          btw: im just making stuff up sooooo...yea     also why did they take so long?
Where is the planet fitness in the space jam system
Please stop
Me when this actually looks extremely fucking cool
Welcome to the Space Jam Jam Jam Jam Jam Jam My Favorite Remix!!
Don't pretend like you're not gonna watch it.
How could you do my girl lola like that
Thought this was gonna be another 20 year late sequel nobody asked for that would inevitably suck, this looks incredible
Awesome!!!!
This is literally the biggest crossover, Endgame can't beat it
I'm happy for LeBron that he gets to be a cartoon but I feel bad for LeBron that he has to spend the majority of this movie with budget cut Looney Tunes.
What about if they dubbed the movie in Arabic, Bulgarian, Brazilian Portuguese, Swedish, Turkish and Spanish for Netflix International, especially Netflix Canada?
Let's gooo!
ooooo it comes out on my birthday 😀
2:10  why Lola bunny gives a sexy wink??  that is  soooooooooo sexist and offends me so much
Hi droogs!  (no seriously wtf are Clockwork Orange characters doing in this family movie yet Pepe LePew is too problematic)
How can so many people like this? It honestly is a worse player one. For how mediocre and cringe the first space jam was, it was a cult classic with a few memorable scenes. This just feels like a milked to the bone reference ridden trash fest.
What the hell is this ready player one kind of shit
They just ruined space jam the messed with one of the best movie ever
First impressions are definitely strong. Seriously impressive CGI work they did on this! The celebrating of all things Warner Bros. feels like a great next step.
King Kong got whooped by Godzilla so he's trying basketball now
this look sick
It looks like a side story in Ready Player One
Looks overwhelmingly cringe, but... I mean, the original movie was kind of too so...
i hope this movie flops i'm sick of cancel culture
Why does this seem like a complete 180 from the original space jam movie, and now it looks more like Ready Player One with all these other properties getting added
In a word...  Ruined
This looks so shit
if i see this ad another time im smashing my monitor
Why are they taking all the good characters out for racist stereotypes when Warner Brothers owns a cartoon where Bugs Bunny is a struggling rapist making that cannon to his character and he still gets to be in it?
Wasn’t sold on this but hopefully it’s good
https://youtu.be/oKNy-MWjkcU
*New Space Jams Drops- Beats old space jams box office*  *Shanon*: See there go ol' Goat James again. Dominating like he always do. Taking over movies now.  *Skip*: Oh please, you kiddin' me? First he teamed up with franchise basketball players and now uh...now takes every movie character ever to be in his film. Bugs bunny isn't enough? He's teaming up with every other movie franchise too?   *Shanon*: Skiiiiipp...They were barely in the mov...  *Skip*: I'll tell you didnt need a bunch of franchises to sell a movie. Michael.... Jeffery... Jordan. I FACT HE NEVER NEEDED THEM, THEY NEEDED HIM.  *Shanon*: SKiiiiiiiiP!!  *Skip*: I'm sorry but are looney tunes selling a billion dollars in shoes or anything for that matter a year? 18 years after they retired??? CASE CLOOOOOSED... Shannon: Skiiiiiiiiiiiiippppp!
why is the clockwork orange gang in the background?
Nothing will beat the nostalgia from the original
Who thought it was a good idea to include the clock orange guys in this?
Lebron be looking fresh in the room squad uni tho
Basketball was supposed to played by hands not feet, the granny just kick the ball
I gotta watch this
Honestly? Looks fucking trash..
They have ruined Lola Bunny. Come on, make a Sonic do over!
i'm hype for space jam 2 broo go Lebron
I didn't know they were making a tron legacy sequel
So a cartoon skunk is bad, but the Droogs are ok?
Idk, I’m just saying...Lebron requesting Superman, Iron Giant, King Kong, and Gandalf when all Michael Jordan needed was Bill Murray.
naaah this movies trying too hard. i'll stick to the original
I stop watching NBA like millions because of this fool
I just ordered a pair of LeBron shoes. Hope everyone else does too.
👎
One of my childhood memories 😍
This is gonna be one big Nike commercial lmao. Time to buy lebrons cause they about to go up 📈
Looks good but non sexy Lola Bunny triggers me! 😂
When you order michael jordan and space jam from wish this is what you get.
Totally not what I was expecting 🤔
They better put meatcanyon's bugs bunny in the movie, or I'm rioting
Who is this movie for?
yo where’s bronny
LeBron is so douche'y.
LeFraud can’t even compete against cartoons without assembling a super team! Shame on you LeGarbage
LBJ will never be MJ
Excuse we while I listen to Dunkstein and Slamough again
So basically what he’s been doing good whole career carry others to victory 💪 can’t wait to see it
Looney Tunes character in this movie
Lebron James, Bugs Bunny, Iron Giant, King Kong, Fred Flintstone and the dudes from Clockwork Orange (Alex, Dim, Pete and Georgie) all in one movie?   Sign Me Up!
looks so good
Wtf did they do to my girl Lola
Where's Pepe?
Trash !!!!
If he thinks he is the GOAT why is he doing everything MJ did 🤷🏽‍♂️. Shouldn’t he create “his own legacy”? Watch he’ll try to play baseball next
Michel  Jordan retired man after one I think that was it
welcome to the space jam
boom looking for this?
Burgess Meredith's Penguin next to Danny Devito's. Not a bad visual. One should consider that the latter touched a teenager inappropriately during his mayoral campaign. He also tried to murder Catwoman when she reacted negatively to his very creepy advances. So why is he allowed to make an appearance?
Horrible looking plot 10/10
Looks like more of a reboot then a sequel. But it still looks fun! Looks like this time they are playing in the real world....cool. :)
The first movie was stupid and this movie will be stupid too
My cat was born 6, Kitten and we made very nice video with them🙏🙏🙏
Welcome Space To Warner-Verse
Just no
The next sequel should be called space jam 3 disney strikes back
CANT WAIT FOR THIS
Meh
Pretty sure I just watched the whole movie in this trailer
Mj is still the goat idk wht this movie on about
oh hell no
These
Well there's another thing Michael Jordan has on LeBron...acting. Super excited not to see this and ruin a classic.
2:23 "There was me, that is Alex, and my three droogs, that is Pete, Georgie, and Dim, and we stood by the court, cheering on the Goon Squad..."
Soooo... Hook?
I can't wait till it's July, the movie sounds like it's gonna be great.
Disney: We just added all of our content in one movie, Ralph Breaks the Internet. Ain't nothing's gonna beat that.   Warner Bros: Hold my basketball.
SO GOOD
Toonpoor ka super Hera spoof
This some phub acting😂
Yo War Machine stop playing with Iron Man tech
Aka Ready Player One for African Americans.
Sorry.
I might actually give this a chance
James is the king of all racist
make lola thick again
Michael Jordan will be happy about this
I hope big chungus makes a cameo in this movie
This didn't have to exist tbh
Already am not a fan of it.. too much CGI. Disney letting thier just hang with all the rights they own now, jeeeezzz
Looks terrible
Lame
Is this a bullshit basketball game
hype
Best bit was the grandma
Sexy Lola Bunny is back  All the fanboy/girls from the first flim :👀
I was really hopping they would do the movie majic of having 2D characters in a real 3d setting but I guess that type of effort and passion isn't profitable enough for hollywood anymore. And what they hell is Drogon from Game of thrones doing there?  Edit: IT is there too. So I guess its any IP that full Warner Bros. distributed.
Looks like it was made for $12
Better not be woke....
LeBron is already a better actor than MJ
Welcome to the world of Warner Brothers.
Eric Bauza’s Daffy Has Evolved To More Grounded Then Goofy Over The Wall Daffy In Looney Tunes Cartoons Im So Glad For The Chnage
So...this trailer was full of...stuff 😐  Im not sure if i Will see the movie cuz this just went all over the place.  I mean, it has something going for it but i cant be the only One who was thinking ”oh no” at 1:38  Felt like i was watching the og movie, Ready player One and Loony tonns back in action 🤔
Oh God any chance that Hollywood could think of something new or is that really to much to ask for
Reboot                                         Me: meh
LeBron James? I think I’ll pass on this woke POC perpetual victimhood promoter.
Some movies don't need a sequel! The first one with MJ was all we needed.
The shitty CGI makes it 10x better
A rip-off switch
Looks like the 1st one will be the best!
What the hell is this vapid, woke garbage?
I loovvveeeeeee the music 😭
this looks like a hot mess
Tryna see mj come back in this movie😂
I’m sorry I’m sure it’ll be a good movie but nothing close to original
It really says a lot that no matter how many brands are in this. I just don’t care.   It looks like “OMG I KNOW THAT THING” The Movie. It gonna blow.
Absolute cancer lebum james cant do anything other then walk into jordans shadow
This not it man
So no pepe but clock work orange seems legit also this is just ready player one
Is it still Space Jam if it has nothing to do with aliens or...you know...SPACE?
🐰🏀
Cool, I hate it.
No no no!  Space jam got alot of crap and was called corny, buy this looks a whole nother level of stupid. Is it someones job in these big studios to do nothing but come up with crapy sequels when they aren't needed lol
I frangirled over the dragon and Kong 😂
I dont know  what to think of this, why they make the loony tunes cgi? why not have them like they were in the first movie?
Curry would of been better
this movie should of been a one time thing and not a sequel.
So he kidnapped his son?
2:10 you a real one if you know that reference.
Didn’t know live action Looney toons was what I needed
Wait, why isn't Lola Bunny hot anymore?!
Ready Player One 2: Electric Boogaloo
The original space jam was fire 🔥 ... this is absolutely trash 🗑 all thanks to the sjw leftist bullshit!   The only reason why it “looks “decent is because of all the crazy animation and effects . Which was clearly used as a distraction. Other then that it’s trash 🗑
Movie but I just really hate LeBron James
1:08 when you’re a grower not a shower.
They are pushing it king James what is there to take a good movie and ruin it
this trailer is fucking sick
Tron/Player ready one/Wrecking Ralph (Hope the quality as well) vibes.  On another note: Anyone having problems with the comment section on PC/Computer?
between 2:05 and 2:06, just above the blue dude’s wing is Big Chungus.  This movie is going to be epic
That’s amazing.
pfft... should been Jordan vs. Lebron, that'd be the real space jam... especially after he lost and realized he wasn't the "king"
Wow, this looks TERRIBLE, lmao
Trying to b just like Mike
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Welcome to the space jam!!
Please make it a Real D 3d please.

So this canonically happens before Barkley Shut and Jam: Gaiden?
Comes out on my bday
I'm calling it right now. 2 things will happen at some point in this movie:  1.) The game is going to come down to having to hit a game winning shot at the buzzer. Lebron is going to pass it instead of taking the final shot. My guess, he'll pass it to Bugs, and Bugs will hit the game winning shot.  2.) They are going to sneak diss Michael Jordan in the movie. At some point, probably after winning the game or something, someone is going to call Lebron the Goat and/or say that he is better than MJ. Or something along those lines.  Calling it right now
I'm not defending anyone here, but the clockwork orange was meant for adults, while pepe was a target for little kids, possibly grooming them into being a certain way. You know how the left loves to be hypocrites when it comes grooming children into things.
this better have a animaniacs cameo or im going to give the ceo a ted talk of insults
Woke woke wokety woke woke.  This movie will be as big of a flop as LeBron's fake foul flops.  This role for Micheal Jordan was given to him because he is admired and is a true GOAT. LeBron pushed for a Space Jam 2 and for him to be the star because fictional characters are the only team mates that can stand to be around him.
Why did they just completely change his skin colour when they made him 2D?
Son: dad you don't listen. 98% movie: all about dad. *surprise twist*: son has gaming skill or something that wins the game.
Wouldn't watch if you paid me.
no way :o
This really didn't need a remake or a sequal. It looks so bad.
Hard pass. This movie will be forgotten REALLY quickly. Cameos alone won't make me see it.
How are people liking this... people forgotten the original and the new generation dont watch WB Looney Tunes... what is this 3D nonsense... who is this demographics directed to? am guessing tik tokers...
They cancelled Pepé le Pew but gave the literal rape gang from A Clockwork Orange courtside seats in Space Jam 2😂😂😂
shouldve been kobe then lebron for space jam 3
Made in China
This looks awful
Laaaaame
This movie is going to fucking suck. I’ll bet $100 Cats Musical will be better than is...
Well this looks like total CGI ADHD nonsense.
No
MJ cameo needs to be in this
This is just a ready player One sequel under a different name!!!
Pathetic, Lewoke ruined the NBA ratings so now finally decided to do the Space Jan movie? To have him as a remake of a movie that Michael Jordan was in is pathetic
I still got the og space jam on vhs along with kazaam!!
Any Lola Bunny fanboys here?
Ruined it. This wasn’t needed.
Lets GOOO COLBY BRYAN GOT IN A MOVIE FINALLY
Yikes
When Lebron remade Space Jam.  Michael Jordan: I took it personal.
Did I see a Game of Thrones Dragon?
Where's Bill Murray??
the original is better despite the lack of fx like this one. the original have that charm and fun atmosphere unlike this overprocessed crap
So this is The 25 Year anticipation⁉️ 🤦‍♂️
Oh man this looks bad. MJ continues to be better than Lebron.
1:12 small chungus
Why aren't there any actual villains in the Goon Squad?
YIKES! 2:15 😂😂😂😂
2:24
willing to bet will do just as bad if not worse like tom and jerry. people tired of woke trash, u bend to cry babies and take characters out. nah, thanks
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
He called looney tunes Rejects!! I'm still going to watch it.
You can't hit the ball with your feet, it's a foul. Just sayin'
So bad😂 kinda reminds me of pixels
Not for epileptics at all. I was overwhelmed but I want to se it.
Wasting money on worthless projects where people are demanding something with a trending HASHTAG for a cause.  ಠ_ಠ
How did the G.O.A.T not get a part in this? 😡
This is either going to be amazing or ✨Horrible✨
Lola was the beginning but she, not the source, she has merely awoken something that was buried deep inside us, you want our existence to have an easy answer, point to something, and stop. But there is no stopping us.
oh my... that movie is going to be AWESOME!
Jesus loves you and forgives you for your past choices and mistakes accept him as your Lord and savior before its to late start a relationship with him read your Holy bible, talk to him every day and pray, he is waiting on you with arms stretch wide open waiting for you he would not force himself on you his a gentleman, kind,loving and PATIENCE. Put your trust in Jesus because he is the only one that will never fail You, worship him day and night , be thankful every day despite of😊  Gospel songs Nobody - casting crowns  Michael w Smith- love in his right hand  COMMUNION- TRIBL I THANK GOD - TRIBL  Voice of GOD - Dante Bowe  CHAMPION - TRIBL   There is much more but accept Jesus he loves you and he knows what's best for you, trust his timing, his ways and thoughts are higher than ours😊🥰🤗🥰
looks shit house compared to og
Goooooo LeBron
Going to take my niece's and nephews out to see it
lebron is a terrible actor lmao 😂
Looks so trash
Look pretty good
Hey WB.  Why did Pepe Le Pew get benched from the movie for inappropriate behavior, but at 2:23 there are 3 literal rapists with courtside seats?  Just curious.
We didn’t ask for this
Nah I don't like this
This no joke looks like one of the worst movies of the century. Ghostbusters 2016...move over
Nobody: Absolutely nobody: Not a single soul: The main character from Space Jam: I’m a cartoon?
So War Machine became Ultron.
I just hope that the 2d animated section of the film lasts more than 5 mins... love 2d animation and there needs to be more of it in feature films
Nobody: Absolutely nobody: Not a single soul: The main character from Space Jam: I’m a cartoon?
#RESTORETHESNYDERVERSE
Space Jam (1996) Space Jam 2 (2021) waited 25 years for a sequel
Trash Jam
I mean...                               still has miss chungus tho
Why are the guys from clock work orange in the movie @2:23
You know lebrons acting has to be legit look at all his fake falls and fouls in the nba
When you look at the iron giant legs and hip it actually looks like the unfinished part from ready player one
This looks extremely ambitious like Ready Player One.
This is a true abortion of movie making.
2:14 is my fav. He tried to pull an MJ and the wall literally stops him. You can’t pull a classic last minute move. You are cool, but not that cool. 😂
What's up duck Never gets Old lol
MJ WAS the best but the old space jam was my childhood lol my first time i see it was in school classroom there ware so many kids watching and me ahhh good times but this one i dont now...
Ready player one (cartoon additition)
The original was better. And it ain't even because of Lola Bunny not being sexualized in this film.  From the trailer alone, it seems like this film can't even decide to Ready Player One or Space Jam.  I mean, don't get me wrong, I don't even know how the film is going to turn out, but, this trailer is kinda of a mixed bag mostly because, while I can kinda respect the animation,(to a certain degree) it just seems like this film is going for a more scifi approach compared to the original where it was more a fantasy approach.
Wait so NO to Pepe Le Pew because the cartoon "promotes rape culture" but the sociopathic Alex DeLarge and his gang from A Clockwork Orange cameo in it? Alex and his friends violently RAPED AND ASSAULTED A WOMAN in the the film...this doesn't make any sense at all.
Bron wanted to be like Mike!
Wonder if the players take a knee before the anthem..
Wish they would of used the voice actor from the first movie to do Bugs again. I don't like the sound of this guy.
Should've made Godzilla and Kong have a 1 on 1 game of basketball.
we need a stan podilack cameo
Wait, why is Alex and his Droogs in this? This is supposed to be a kids movie and they give a cameo to the Clockwork Orange gang-rapists? WTF?!
Someone should make Lola Bunny thicker than she actually is.
This honestly doesn't look very good
I’m going to save my 1 yr old son from this trash rendition of Space Jam so It doesn’t kill the classic 90’s MJ film. He’ll thank me one day 🙌🏼🤟🏼
Disgusting
1:40 that movie is an underrated masterpiece.
The sequel is never as good as the og
Jesus is the way, The Truth and the Life! The time is now to turn from your sins and your fleshly desires and Turn to Jesus Christ, To live a life with meaning and purpose. God doesn’t want ANYONE to perish, he loves you and wants to save you! Jesus can help you Change from your old ways. We’ve ALL sinned and fallen short of the glory of God! We all deserve hell, but thankfully God made a way for us sinners to come to repentance and be saved. As we know the wages of sin is death (hell). But the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord. Jesus is the ONLY way to the father in heaven!  We are only saved through Jesus Christ!  - John 14:6 King James Version 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. - There is absolutely nothing we or anyone can do to save themselves we aren’t saved by works,We are saved by Grace through faith alone!  God loves the sinner hates the sin, remember we can love one another WITHOUT supporting or encouraging their sins. So with this all being said if you haven’t already Give Jesus Christ your life Today! He WANTS to spend eternity with you in heaven!! We MUST be Born again to even inherit the kingdom of heaven  - John 3:3 King James Version 3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. - He thinks about you all the time and loves you! He truly wants to spend eternity with you in heaven! God loves you! There is absolutely NOTHING that can ever separate God’s love and mercy for you! Pick up your Cross, and Follow Jesus! Ask for forgiveness! Time is running out! Jesus is coming soon one day no one knows the hour or day but the father in heaven. Keep praying and seeking The Lord!  Pray without ceasing! And no matter what choose Faith over fear! You are NOT alone! God said “I will never leave nor forsaken you “  He is a promise keeper!  Jesus loves YOU, have an amazing day! 🙂💗 Pls read (Proverbs 28:13)
space jam 2: electric boogaloo
Dumbledore at 1:53, slightly to the right of old-school Joker.
So why did they take the son again?
that looks AWESOME!
Tears when I saw iron giant.
Glad Lebron in Space Jam. Better seeing him then Kobe in my opinion
Na-uh. I think I'll wait for _Zack Snyder's Space Jam_ , thanks.
Low key feel like they did to much
Ah the memories being renewed, yes!!
This looks pretty bad but I bet people will be blinded by the nostalgia of the first one to see if it's good or not
Damn Granny Got Her Game On
Drogon?
Oh my god, this SUCKS
this trailer looks better than the entire original space jam movie
Why??
No Pepe Le Pew? :(
Tune world? Not toon? As in cartoon?
I'm disappointed he's a cartoon tho.
let’s see:  monetise 90s nostalgia : check reboot/continue and old franchise : check left political propaganda: check  this is going to be another great hit...
Nope
2:07 on the left, by the court line, The Mask
MJ right now "...and I took that personally"
Are the gremlins and the Shoe People gotta be in this film?
The sheer amount of characters and franchises included (even if barely) in this trailer is kind of impressive to me, ngl.
Okay but them actually using so many characters across so many different franchises - hannah barbera or not - means this movie opens up to the omniverse. Checkmate marvel
Nah, the old one is like 10x better, and i can say that before watching this for sure.
This looks bad....lol
That first “no” was very interesting, to say the least.
Idgaf I want hypersexualized Lola bunny!
Nah
finally
It looks super dope but I dont know if LBJ acting skills will be awkward.
“What in the matrix hell?” HAHAHAHA COMEDIC GENIUS. ALSO GAME OF THRONES LMAO REMEMBER HOW GOOD THAT SHOW WAS?
No esta Pepe Le Pew demostrando su amor intenso pero si estan unos drogadictos violadores,Bien Warner...; mi famila no vera esta pelicula.
I ion tryna hate but that should’ve been Kobe rip 824
Amo la canción 😍😍😍 welcome space!!!
Total buns.
The only kid that can yell at bron
WB: "We can't have Pepe le Pew, people will cry about normalizing or some shit." Also WB: "Meanwhile, here's Alex DeLarge and his gang, known for violence and sexual assault, right here in the crowd."
This movie is not gonna be good. Stop Trying To Remake or Make Sequels Even Prequels if the first Film was already a Hit.
Off topic abit but can you imagine a iron giant vs Kong vs god zilla? Fuck me
Nothing beats the original
How many drums do you want in the music? WB: yes
😶😯😯😯
Everyone: Is this SpaceJam or Ready Player One? LeBron: *How bout both?*
4 sum reason this reminds me of ready player one
Where the fuck is Bill Murray?
no thanks
This looks AWFUL. The CG looks downright terrible, why can't you get off your lazy asses and actually do some old fashioned 2d styled drawing which looks much better than this CG diarrhea?  Also which fucker over at WB went ""Let's remove a cartoony harasser, but keep in the cameo appearance of a gang that stalks, rapes and murders."? Because that person needs to be fired ASAP
Plot twist: What if the Al-G Rhythm was secretly Mr. Swackhammer, the villain from the previous Space Jam movie?
why does this have 18k dislikes this looks sick not gonna lie xd
was it an artistic decision to make the animation this fucking ugly?
This shit fire
This looks like a really fun movie lol
By the time this movie is complete, Warner Bros. is gonna be bankrupt.
I can already hear the low quality SiIvaGunner Space Jam rips coming from a mile away.
This is fucking stupid, I won't even watch it for free.
So it's ready player one
I wat to see lat movee
This looks great! I’m ready for it!
I just instantly smiled when I heard him say "What's up doc?"
A Clockwork Orange reference in a Space Jam movie about cartoon characters playing basketball for, what a wonderful world
This gives me major Ready Player One Vibes.. but it’s Space Jam and better than Ready Player One
100% badass 🔥🏀
Yea sure this movie seems pretty unnecessary and has no reason to exist, but it looks fun as hell and I’m all for it.
So War Machine just kidnapped Lebron James's son to play some basketball?
Nope not watching. They nerfed Lola      bunny
Clockwork orange characters shouldn't be in this, obvious who ever made this movie doesn't care about it
1:51 Not me thinking it was Ryuk 💀
This movie better has "Basketball Jones" voiced by Chris Rock & Barry White or else!
So, they cut Pepe Le Pew because he was inappropriate for kids...and then they just straight up put actual rapist characters in the movie. Seriously, at 2:22 you can see Alex and the other characters from A Clockwork Orange.
Why? Why not just leave the originals as they are? Think of something new Hollywood
How are people liking this? Looks absolutely awful (and not even in a funny way)
2:24 should the clockwork orange guys really be in this?
Dammit, this actually look good.
*She’s back.*  You all know who I’m talking about.
This looks so bad.
No
YAAASSSSS LEBRON AGSHSHSHSJ
Looks good
M.j-  i took lebrons space jam personal 😄😄😄
#NotMyLolaBunny
This is trash. Stop reskinning our child hood. No creativity. Yikes.
Ahhh yes, Ready Player Two
Man this looks like it's gonna be awful. Lola looks like a shit child, there is way too much unrelated WB properties, and you replaced Pepe le pew with clockwork orange rape gang. Why does this exist? Why did this get made? Who's fucking cousin wrote this script? Can you get the money back?
Lemme get my space jam gear together🤣🤣
This looks so Dope!
god respect to the Animators i dont want to know how man digital Characters they have created and than to animate them for just seconds Amazing and People are just hating on CGI so sad but yeah i Love the Art of VFX fantastic
WokeJam with Beijing Lebron.
Mj watching the trailer "And I took that personally"
Should have had other nba stars in this just like the first Space Jam
This looks just as ridiculous as it needs to be.
Them graphics hard as fuckkl
Well this is ambitious
Lebron likes genocide and child labor.
This looks absolutely atrocious
Wait what's the motive? Am i the only one confused about this unnecessary sequal/reboot? I was hyped when i heard about it but looking at the trailer I'm not sure how i feel...
No.
Not the same...
So ya take out pepe...but Clockwork is absolutely fine to have 🤣🤣🤣 this generation is fucking horrible
#Restorethesnyderverse
Holy crap, I get that it's doing a massive ip crossover thing, but maybe next time leave out the actual rape gang from clockwork orange?
I can actually say I'm excited for this
#Restorethesnyderverse
Nobody woke enough to stay awake during this..
This just... I don't think it will be anywhere near the original
I likeeee so excited to watch it
Did I just see a clip of fricken drogon from game of thrones? LMFAO
Has anyone spot Jim Carrey The Mask on far left 2:08 pause there
Wait a moment, this actually looks good!
I knew I was gonna root against the MC for selecting Kong instead of Godzilla in his team
Why??!
23rd on trending
lame
Get ready for Fortnite to MILKKKK this like crazy.
finally
That's not lola
Why do movie producers think: ah yes, we are into popular culture, let's just keep putting IRON GIANT yes we are hip kids, yep yep SO SAD BIG EMOTION NOSTALGIA  Genuinely embarassing.
🤡
🚮
Should of been Kobe...
Life is so unpredictable! Just last month I argued vehemently that the options on this platform couldn't be real and this month I am writing a review in the opposite direction! Bitcoinsamurai is the best platform out there! I am so delighted I decided to give it a try at all!
*Fun fact: ur not watching this in full screen*
Ready player one ... Meets Tron... meets the matrix.... meets the loony tunes
Whyyyyyyyyyyyy
Lola Bunny playing the role of Dwayne Wade and Lebron lob dunk 🤣
this is HYPE!
This like wreck it ralph or smth

Lebron ruined the movie he's way to over rated
Soo cool trailer best film ever with LeBron james
I'm... Cautiously optimistic.
The fact YouTube detects this as a suggestion to "Looney Tunes", the one starring Brendan Fraser, is fun! Is this really going to be the rebooted version of Looney Tunes: Back In Action, on a massive scale?
They should’ve let the first movie be... what’s this????🤨🙄
MJ "and I took that personally"
Michael Jordan is Going to "take it personally"...
Warning: This is canon
Can’t wait!!! My son is gonna love this

NOOOO!! DONT BASTARDIZE IRON GIANT!!!
I know the iron man knock off did not just call LeBron James a clown
So, it's just ready player one, but with basketball?
Oh wow they got the dude that plays war machine in marvel
I can tell this gonna fail even more than Looney Tunes: Back In Action
🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is gonna suck ass
I fear an Iron Giant live action remake in the future.
Who wants to watch an entire movie of Lebron not passing the ball?
But will Animaniacs be providing commentary during the match?
Nope
All the MJ fans here to bitch because MJ couldn’t make another movie at nearly 60 years old ;/
Those people saying " it's going to be ass" are the same ones that are still gonna watch the movie 😂🤣💀
I hate Lebron so I’m going to ban my son from going to see this 😂
Pepe Le Pew not allowed but Clockwork Orange and Game of Thrones characters are ok. Lolz.
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
feel like I'm a child again
🚮
This is why LeBron signed with LA
This looks amazing even though I don't follow basketball. Does anyone know who the main person in the advert is ik he plays basketball but I dunno his name
This looks so ass. Is this a joke?
Mj a better actor I already see that
Glad i can still thumbs down this shit for now till youtube removes the feature
Se solo LBJ fosse stato italiano...
1:39 I didn't know I was watching "Ready Player One" 2?
I wonder how ridiculous this looked behind the scenes
I can't wait for this one 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤯🤯🛸🛸🛸🏀🏀🏀🏀👑👑👑🖤
*YYYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO*
this is beyond cringe, beyond horrible. I hate everything about this. The original was a shit movie and this looks about a hundred billion times worse than i was even expecting. this is an all time new low. I dont think ill ever watch a movie ever again, i have lost all hope for humanity.
This is awful
THE VISUALS!!
I'm not woke enough for this...
I am sorry, but I just cant.
Should have just left this movie alone why does every movie person got to destroy our classics I'd be surprised if this movie turns out to be a flop can we please stop taking our old classics and ruining them
Looks gay
Who saw big chungus
Ready Player Two looking a lot different than I anticipated.
#RestoreTheSnyderverse
I hope Michael Jordan makes an appearance in this movie
Animation is much better, but this is some terrible writing. LJ & his son get off on the wrong floor, enter what would be a highly secure data center area where an AI lives for no reason & that AI kidnaps Lebron's son in-order to challenge him to a game of basketball?  How many millions did they dump into this? This is what they come up with??!??!? 😂
There is only one space jam movie. He will never be an MJ.
The whole mega-IP-mashup-in-a-virtual-world thing just feels stale now after Ready Player One and Wreck it Ralph. Feels like there’s even a movie or two I’m forgetting about that have done this sort of thing
#RestoreTheSnyderverse     #ReleaseTheAyercut
Don Cheadle telling the story in the future: So I capture Lebron James’s son and challenge him to a basketball game. In return he gets his son back. Anyways Lebron wins the game so I find him after the game, drop his son at his feet and say “Boom u lookin for this”
So these where the left over assets from Ready Player one right... or did Warner Brothers just rip off one of its own films?
For some reason I keep rewatching this trailer
What have they done to my beautiful Lola :(
Why does everyone want Michael Jackson to make a cameo? Ain't he dead?
So missed the original ! Cg animation is very cold and dull.
It's such a coincidence I was playing Space Jam (PS1) on my hacked PSP 3000 and I got this ad and here I am. *So excited for this movie!*
Pepe Le Pew is cut out for sexual harassment. Yosemite Sam  shoots people is ok... Welcome to America!
Michael Jordan: This is becoming personal with me
tbh i just wanted to see bugs bunny and daffy duck again cause they were my childhood but im also getting king kong and more and tbh i just wanted to have looney toones only cause they best
Dom: DAD Lebron 2 hours later DOM

So much hate for a movie you haven't even seen 🤷‍♂️
no just no

LeBron is a punk. None will watch this
CRINGE WORTHY!!!!
looks like fortnite
me, the only human alive who genuinely enjoyed Osmosis Jones, squinting as hard as I can: Where The Fuck Is My Boy?
LOOKS LIKE A BOOTLEG SPACE JAM LOL CANT AFFORD TO KEEP LEBRON A HUMAN LMAO
So... the movie is targeted at kids.  This means they want kids to look up Game of Thrones and Clockwork Orange.  Ok then...
I CLAPPED!!  I CLAPPED WHEN I SAW THE THING!!!!
We need a Bill Murray cameo
I'ma give this movie 4 thumbs down😂😂😂😂😂
This lola bunny better have the sonic movie treatment my boys, a whole generation is going to miss out on their first crush otherwise
wtf is this trash
I don't know why people hate on lebron. A lot people made up there mind this movie is trash before it even came out.
Ready player space jam
I like how the iron giant just cameos in different movies even though it came out so long ago do kids even know who that is anymore
Yall ready for this?
I wonder if R kelly will do the soundtrack?
Still wont be the og.
Bro Lola bunny don’t even look cute anymore 😔
I’ve got mixed emotions about this. Still going to watch it.....but space jam with MJ is still my top fav. movies to watch since I was a kid.  Same goes for Hercules. Lol oh god I’m getting old...
Me: Hey, Where's Pepe? Warner: Sorry he has been canceled by the woke mob...... Me: So his bad behavior save him from this piece of crap huh.....
Scylla - RL Grime
daffy: shoot the ball,  sam: *literally shoots the ball* boy this is legit real classic looney tune humor
They took everything and replaced it with a child
would have been a great video game, a mix of RPG and basketball . Spacejam A new Legacy  official video game
We're living in a very strange century where even the lamest movies from the '80's and '90's are getting inexplicable sequels. What's next, THE WIZARD 2: PUTNAM RISING?
This is weird, also why youtube recommends Looney Tunes Back In Action and not the Classic Space Jam?
Mantap , nice 👍
My god you can tell they couldn’t top the original so they copied ready player one.... the cgi was just obviously going to happen but they take away so much attention from Lebron with all this bs they add to the movie smh. He’s not a bad actor they could have easily done less of the pop culture ready player one shit. Missed opportunity
#restorethesnyderverse
no no no thank you WB's for this bullshit
This CGI makes me feel soooooo old I grew up on the old fashion animation, the loony toons were a part of my earliest childhood memories
Shit looks embarrassing
I can’t look at this the same way after wabbit season
For a solid second I thought this was a NBA jam game lmao.  I need sleep...
Looks like shit. Did they really need to make this?
The super atlethic granny was already an old clichet after Hoodwinked. Also, kicking is against the rules.
So it's a black only movie? Needs more white representation for diversity.
I love Lebron  James and everything but they should have done this with Kobe. Rest his soul.
why is lola not thicc anymore :( not a furry btw
Warning: This Movie is Canon
Garbage!!!!
Not impressed.  But it'll be fun to watch when it's heavily discounted
We Love you Mr. Lebron James! Thank you for always standing up for the Black Community!
Why the fuck did they go CGI with this? That's literally the opposite of what it should be, the fun comes from the super well made hand drawn animation working together with live action. If you remove that the whole thing is pointless.
*“SENIOR DISCOUNT! +30 POINTS!”*  I’m dead 💀😭🤣😂
No Pe Pe Le Pew but we still see Yosemite Sam's guns.
Go ahead a get Kong off y’all team before he throw the match
RL Grime get that WB check!!
super WEAK

Is that robot in the people jersey supposed to represent Kobe Bryant?
If they don't give the song " I believe i Can fly " it will murder them!!!!
It should be a continued legacy. Not a new legacy.
I liked the old Lola bunny.
Lola bunny looks so bad
No mention of MJ or anything from the previous Space Jam smh. No thank you, Im good.
And I took that personally
Movie looks fire great job KING JAMES keep it up bro and continue to ignore the haters they jus mad bcuz they aint YOU!!!

WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW NO LO PUEDO CRERER AI ESTOY NERVIOSA QUIERO ESE DISCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I watch this at least 5 5imes a day
I hope the movie's better than the trailer made it look. I've already seen Ready Player One I'd like to see a Space Jam Sequel.
this shit looks stupid. this man tries to copy MJ in everything outside of basketball. from movies to smoking cigars. MJs space jam was corny as fuck n bad acting but he was god mode on the court so the movie made it worth watching bcus MJ cameback from retirement. lebron is a great basketball player but he will never beat MJ bcus he is not original outside of basketball. shit he cant even out sale MJ in his shoes and MJ been retired for more then 20yrs. what else is he guna try to copy from MJ ? a tequila
Looks just as shit as the first one
I'm not at all sure this is going to be anywhere near the original.
Lebron unoriginal Whackass
I mean......
The ONLY reason I am not watching this is because LeBron "cry baby" James is in it
MJ: and I took that personally.
OOOOMMMMMMGGGGGGGGGG I'm Hyped
Nooooo I won’t see this I’m sorry but   The original movie with Michael Jordan is so much better and it was the best   This looks awful
No ones talking about how they ripped off Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Ready Player One.
Someone take away Yosemite Sam's guns right now. I'm offended... /s
Bruh imagine they used bronny and put him on LeBrons team

Where's Michael Jordan??? lame.
this looks ridiculous
As long as they ain't fighting over sum dum shi like instagram followers should be good😎
MJ better make a cameo, that's all I'm saying.
It took 18 years to make a sequel
This movie looks like shit
I’m kinda disappointed that the enemy team weren’t character from other franchises like joker,penny wise, or the mask instead there are just background character
Nah.

Space Jame needs to be a 90s thing. This...this hurts.
can LeBron ever stop copying the GOAT MJ apparently not him and his crew don't have an original thought amongst them SMH pathetic
this one is gonna be a big flop..
I think it will be an interesting movie!!!
i miss old Lola
Is it just me but watch it again but in the crowd I saw joker and Robin?? There's probably more I'll have to watch it again.
They have now successfully ruined almost every last one of the great 90s movies.  Tired and pathetic.  This looks like godawful garbage.
This looks awful. I can't wait to see it.
What is Michael Burnham doing there?

We are all going to the movies to watch Space Jam 2. It looks amazing!
Swackhammer (Danny DeVito), an evil alien theme park owner, needs a new attraction at Moron Mountain. When his gang, the Nerdlucks, heads to Earth to kidnap Bugs Bunny (Billy West) and the Looney Tunes, Bugs challenges them to a basketball game to determine their fate. The aliens agree, but they steal the powers of NBA basketball players, including Larry Bird (Larry Bird) and Charles Barkley (Charles Barkley) -- so Bugs gets some help from superstar Michael Jordan (Michael Jordan).   Me: will this be the same thing but with new chracters?
LOLAAAAA
YESSSSS so watching this with my girlfriend😩🔥
I'll 𝕨𝕒𝕥𝕔𝕙 if people blow it up on 𝕥𝕨𝕚𝕥𝕥𝕖𝕣
what is this they didn't get enough of The Iron Giant model in ready player one that they have to turn this into whatever it is? I'm so confused
Superman, Gandalf, King Kong, Iron Giant, and Lebron James would be an awesome team
Does someone saw Harry Potter characters, please, i can"t find it!!!
Bugs bunny has had some work done I think
the only thing they actually need to do to make this movie good as just go play basketball with the tune Stars again and its a good movie, What is happening
Lemme guess...the water is curry and the fire is klay? 😂yea ik
what is the real Don Cheto doing ruling in a monarchy in a so-called serversverse and having called combative dealings with the real LeBron James in my bunny go slamtown movie featuring Michael Jordan? Where's Bill?
MJ: "I took that personal"
Ready player one + Basketball. SPACE JAM ✌
This trailer is really good
So far, this movie is not a sequel to the first Space Jam, in fact, more of a revision of it. LeBron James himself announced it's not a sequel. Especially, the Looney Tunes characters have to learn to how to play basketball in it likes in the first one. Also, the Looney Tunes characters live inside the Warner Bros.' database in the new one, while in the original they live underground.
I'm going to watch it n because of the female bunny
this movie looks terrible. Lebron has no personality for this kind of movie, he looks likes he's there but not want to
I’ve watched this several handful of times and the excitement doesn’t go away
They seriously included the gang from A Clockwork Orange.
Excited for this 🤣
.
In real life he’s black, they make cartoon brown...... wtf
I'll tell you now if you have 10%+ bad reviews then it WILL fail. This movie will never save Hollywood and looks terrible compared to the original. I'll keep saying it: this looks like a bad version of Ready Player One. And that was just not good.
It looks cool but already Lebrons Dialogue seems forced & Lebron isn’t acting well at all, based on the trailer which is sad cuz he had soo much promise Cuz he was good in that Train wreck movie or w/e it was called with Bill Hader

⚠️ATTENTION CALLING ALL DIRECTIONERS⚠️  As you all know, the 11 year anniversary is coming up on the 23rd of next July. But we have some projects we must complete before then. Those targets are as follows;  1) Even though songs like More than this, best song ever, etc, have hundreds of millions of views,  it's still not what they deserve.  We have decided to stream the song on July 22nd, the day before the 11 year anniversary to get the song to charts. Maybe we have to start streaming a little bit before hand, but still. We need to stream the song on every possible platform; YouTube, Spotify, iTunes, Amazon music etc. If this is the same group if people who sold FNB stadium within a miniute, then why couldn't we be able to do this?  2)  This was planned a year ago, but this time we could easily do this. The second project is to stream drag me down, which as we can see is so close to 1 billion views, but story of my life isn't, so we will stream story of my life on July 18th (The last Sunday before the anniversary) and make the masterpiece number 1 on that day. I think non of the above are difficult tasks, but that's only if we spread the words. So kindly spread the words.  Copy and paste this, guys, believe me we can do it! I know we kinda planned it last time and fell short, but we can do it if we try harder   Guys July is approaching fast, we need to start invading all videos on the internet. Copy this on to your clipboard, and paste it onto all trending videos. Guys, seriously now, we have GOT to do this.  Btw I realise this is kinda unrelated, but idc this has to happen ❤♥️💛💙🖤❤💚🧡

MJ about to bust some ass and give em 60
This a MOVIE for BLACK PPL! Play basketball and make it out the HOOD! Forget studies!!!
undeserved
This is gonna suck
Mmmm no.
Micheal Jordan just took this personal.
If you're calling this movie a soulless cash crab, you have to call the original Space Jam that too. The first Space Jam came to be because an Air Jordan ad with Bugs and Jordan made a whole lot of money. This movie at least looks like it's telling a story, it's gonna give Lebron James character development. He starts off as a father who doesn't listen to his sons dreams, and has to learn to let his son be his own person. From the plot leaks it seem that even the looney tunes will get some development. All the tunes except Bugs left Tune Town, the tunes are gonna have to learn how to be a true tune squad again! What lesson did Michael Jordan learn? Don't play baseball because you suck at it? Stick to basketeball? Regardless of how corny it might end up being, at least they seem to be giving a full movie this time. Of course no one can really speak on the nature of this movie, July 16th will be the real judge. But please give this movie a chance. Bring the Looney Tunes back in the spotlight!!!
I am very disappointed
Space Jam’s supposed to be for kids, you creepy snowflakes complaining about everything lol
" What in The Matrix hell?" Priceless
Where is Lola Bunny?!?! Respectfully...
1:18 WHY WOULD A STAR BASKETBALL PLAYER LIKE LEBRON JAMES CHOOSE FUCKING KING KONG TO BE ON A BASKETBALL TEAM

Oh baby couldn’t be any better King Kong and king James In One Movie🤯🔥
Already feel like this should’ve been Kobe I’m still gonna watch
This is so lit 🔥
It’s been brought to my attention that the mask is in this movie, is it?
“Hes your new space jam star? Okay fine, thats all I needed.”
Oh... My... God... I'm sorry Michael, I'm sorry you have to live through knowing that this crap will hit theaters some time in the future.
No thank you
This movie is going to suck. LeBron can’t act.
You know I'm supposed to destroy this guy..... and from that point on I did. 🤣
i love it when they use Kongs original roar

New space jam movie: MJ:I take this personal
TBH, it looks like a faithfull sequel to Space Jam 1.  I mean, I re-watched original like a week ago and, man, it's bad... But we watched and liked it for another reason. No, not Lola! We wanted to see 2D and 3D characters Interact with real people. And if you don't take this sequel too seriously (and you shouldn't) it seem to give us exactly that!
That bunny doing a D Wade was cute ☺️.
Okay but when we getting Iron Giant II???
Franchise that hasn’t had a major installment in 10-25 years: exist   Companies: *come my child for you are ripe for the picking*
yoo
I don't think it will be as good as the 1st one. But well see.
Give us back the true Lola bunny
I love this
Wait.. did he literally call him king james?? 💀💀
This movie: exists MJ: “and I took that personally”
All these iron giant cameos.. can we just get a iron giant remake already?
Where the real Lola Bunny
The fact that this has more veiws than the black widow trailer says something
This looks genuinely terrible.
MJ "LeBron made the same film as me, I took that personal"
#LetLePewandSpeedyJam
damn why are y’all hating on this, the majority of you all are not satisfied with anything. don’t take movies too seriously, it’s literally about LeBron & looney tunes characters playing basketball
How Handsome is  LeBron James as Cartoon.
At least Lebron can act better than Jordan
This is bullshit yall are basically doing ready player 1 but as space jam...wtf... and you all Nerfed Lola's looks? What I thought Hollywood supports all woman of all shapes and sizes...but yall cant handle a buxom bunny...lame
Is that Bryce son of lbj??
I don’t know how to feel about this
They should have just just picked up on the original space jam 20 years later. This looks cheesy
Ready player one part two
Boycott this !! Bring back Pepe Lepew!!!!!
This is fire
Disney needs to take some notes when it comes to live action I mean think about they don't need to remake all there old movies in live action they can always do it in 3D but thank God Warner Bros added some 2D in the film I'm watching the first Space Jam movie and it really hasn't age well back then they were still getting used to all this CGI and 3D Animation and seeing this trailer and them making all the Looney Tune characters 3D was pretty cool
blah
mehh
I don't like the CGI. They should have just kept it traditional animation. And they should have kept the original design of Lola. And they shouldn't have cancelled Pepe. Yet they reference A Clockwork Orange, one of the most violent and sexually depraved movies ever made. Can't wait to see how well that goes over.
Looks trash, like Bron trying to hard to outdo Jordan.
Sucks off China, pass.
1:38 We don't want another Sonic
I hate hollywood
Idk. The first one had more things  into it structure into the movie and cool moments don't get me wrong this looks cool with story and all but it seem one direction of the movie kinda thing!! Idk how to explain
so.... where are the Monstars?

MJ Space Jam is better than queen LeBron James the drama queen
Before coming in July 17th: Disneyland's 66th Birthday
I'll wait for Malcolm D. Lee's ultimate cut on HBO MAX.
Of course go and ruin another classic.... It looks kinda cool but nah the original was the classic... Stop remaking movies Hollywood...
Personally I think it would have been better to keep them to just looney tunes. Why WB thinks they have to cram in every other WB franchise I don't know? Also why is there adult programs and films getting cameos in it? Especially when cancel culture got pew di pie canceled and they changed Lola bunny aswell? Then they put game of thrones and clockwork orange in it? Get real!!!
only legends know the mickeal jordan space jam
I wonder if he'll be king flop in the movie like he is IRL
I dont know, not feeling it for this one. Will still probably see it.
the corporate world doesn't know how to get people the theaters anymore..
What in the Ready Player One is happening here?
What it this ready player one with basketball?
How stupid, just like the first.
Ah LeBron, still chasing Jordan's legacy I see. Somewhere MJ is smokin a cigar shaking his head, bring back the 90s!
Lebron makes this look like an advertisement :/
"BE HONEST WHO'S BEEN A FAN FOR A LONG TIME?”  “¡ᴍ ɢɪ🄵T̶ɪɴɢ ᴇᴠᴇʀʏöꪀᴇ ᴡʜo ꒒ɪᴋᴇꇙ ᴀɴᴅ sᴜʙŞ ᴛᴏ ᴍᴇ”🎶
This is great, that the Space Jam "god" is Don Cheadle who played in Rebound. Legendary harlem rucker player; its said jordan was inspired by this man.
#freethebunnyboobies
Every time I see her I think, hey it's Michael burnham....shouldn't u be un space working on that next season
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Sequels and remakes,  Hollywood has become so unoriginal and unwatchable
They canceled Pepe Lepew but they didn't cancel Yosemite Sam for shooting at people?  What a bunch of %$&@!
This looks... absolutely terrible.  Why all the reboots!?
What in the matrix hell!?
This “king” is owned by Chyna and acts more like a jester . He even entertains us in multiple levels.
Pennywise 1:46
This is literally the lakers vs the brooklyn nets
They Ruined Space Jam ! WTF
The bad thing about the film is going to be the performance of JAMES JJJ but still there I will be in the cinemas ... IDOLOS the #WARNERBROS Best Brand :*
If Michael bay directed looney tunes
Bruh y'all hating on this its 2021 the second movie is almost never the better then the first
Boom!! You looking for this??
Not sure how to feel about this, its looks pretty good but the bad guys look..... I dunno. If they bring the monstars in to help the loony tunes beat them though, that would be an awesome throwback
Lmfao all these characters are racist though according to the media and USA politics.
#continuethemonsterverse
Maannn... I wish Michael was there as cameo
#Restorethesnyderverse
Do u think in 2 decades when another basketball player rises like LeBron  and Michael  they will make another space jam
First off... How the hell is that old lady still even alive!
Stupid movie. Pass
So is this not a Sequel???
I hope this is a major flop.
So apparently Zendaya voices Lola...
Let's gooo!!!!
They’re passing THIS off as the sequel to my childhood
Did you see Game Of Thrones?
It won't be as good as the original!
damn bronny couldnt even play himself
I mean jesus christ is anything sacred not going to be touched didn't ask for this didn't need it. Hollywood so fucking lazy these days.
Why are there rapists in the trailer?
Lebrons a wannabe. 😂🤣
Biggest cross over evwr
Is Robert Kelly doing the films song ?
Space Jam set in the Ready Player One universe or sum?
I'm ok with changing the story but that goon squad has nothing to do against the aliens of the original space jam.
Am I blind or did i just fucking see Rathian flying with the gigantic robot?
This looks like a hot pile of shit. We can only pray it bombs
Do kids these days even know who bugs bunny is
Some movies  should be left aoone
Did i just saw king kong?
are you dumb this is 2
This looks incredibly dumb. Yall are too easily impressed with this lazy attempt at pandering. Wb do a better job.
Bruh, labron isn't even trying... at least get an athlete that can pretend to act. My god...
It is stupid to renové Pepe Le Pew and leave the clockwork orange that they did something worse in their plot than things they did not

Ready Player One vibes
Now I realize why they did the redesign for Lola Bunny, since they were gonna make it look more CGI related old her definitely would've looked a lot more sexual in the CGI version, though I feel like it shouldn't have been that big of a deal.
This is gonna be so good
I feel this one I  am waiting much more than End Game

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Restoresnyderverse
This looks awesome!!! I cannot wait to see the film!!!!!!
A trailer that made me anxious to watch the movie in a very long time.. But why is every trailer has this Marvel like BGM..thump thump..dun dun dun..
So based on this it's about a Lebrons son not wanting to play basket ball, followed by the kid getting kidnapped by Don Cheadle and forcing Lebron into playing basketball with cartoon characters...this set up seems weird to me. Like why throw the stuff in about his son? Like couldnt you just trap Lebron and say the only way out is to win this basketball game? It seems unnecessary to me to have the kid. Isk I guess I'll just have to see how that all works out.
This looks awesome :)
This might actually be the most tone-deaf and obsequious movie trailer I've ever seen.
They cant win because they dont invited pepe le peuw...
Ehhh is a rip off of mj legacy gtfo here
wheres my boy, PEPE LE PEW>???????!!!!!  >;(
WTF is this?

Sorry but you’ll never beat the original
Looks like an Astro world music video

toonpur ka superhero did this first😂  jokes apart, so excited about this 2d, 3d and VFX combined movie, the technical director, animation supervisor and VFX supervisor would had to be super patient with each other😂
Honestly the plot seems a bit weird and i feel  like some characters are missing like the aliens from the first movie to really make this a sequel

This looks fucking terrible
So Ready Player One but with basketball?
The afraid t-shirt simulteneously level because stitch coherently reign below a useless slash. scandalous, obese bat
If you had a cardboard cutout of James, it would be a better actor then him.
How many subs can I get from this video?
I LOVE THIS
Boom! You lookin for this
America is open to all immigrant from africa and central america
This just makes me want to watch the original lol. I hope the actual movie is better than the trailer.
Why'd they turn chungus sand colored?.
Ready Space Basketball Player One Jam
I don’t see anyway to top the original Space Jam, the best they can hope for is to as good or at least be talked about as much as the other.
Is Kong gonna play? Or is he still recovering from his 1v1 with godzilla?
Warner bros coming out with bangers nowadays
Wow, so WB made sure Pepe le Pew wasn't in the film but put Clockwork Orange rapists in crowd. Great job with the HYPOCRICY. And WHY TF would the Knight King from GOT be watching a F*ing basketball game?
What have they done with my girl?(
#Restorethesynderverse
Just..no
This giving me looney toons meets mortal combat vibes and i love it

All I know is, he better not win with a bunch of nobodies vs the superstars, who do he think he is? 🤨MICHAEL JORDAN 🤷🏾‍♂️
This loves frickin cool
skip bayless has left the chat
So no cameos from other players just Bron and Cartoons? MJ got a few fellaz a check. The best part of the 1st to me was seeing Mugsy Bouges help MJ out.
#restorethesnyderverse

Is that a sleeve? Only niggas in the NBA wear sleeves
Eh
That senior discount tho 🔥🔥😂
This looks aweful
All I want to know is....      Was this animated at the Chinese Concentration Camps by slave labor?
#RESTORETHESNYDERVERSE
I think it's pretty cool something like Jordan did
MJ - "I'll take out the monstars out with Bill Murray and Wayne Knight.  LBJ - "I need a team of superstars to take out the Goon Squad."  Couldn't be a more accurate display of the 2 of them throughout their careers! 🤣😆
Nice
Even though Im against movies with obvious ultra SJW agenda I don't understand ppl complaining about amount of afroamericans in this specific movie  There are just more afroamericans in basketball, because they are naturally better at it. These are obvious public numbers, results of a simple natural selection. You want an all white movie about basketball? Then don't suck at it lol
People still can’t get over the Nerfing of Lola, Warner Bros.
Brought to you by the friendly people at the CCP.

It took u guys 2 decades to make a movie well done
Do kids even know who the Looney Tunes are these days? This is going to flop. LeBron doesn't have the same insane star power as Jordan did back in the day.
I hate it
#Gematria
They Ruined Lola Bunny Tho 🤦🏻‍♂️
I want to see that movie
*He got his hairline back I see*
👎🏼
POV: this is a parody of Shazam or something
needa movie like this every decade.
wow
Obviously Oscar worthy.
1:44 ha, they're poking at their selves
Looks absolutely ridiculous ..... 😑 Why make a sequel when Yaaaa don't need one? Whatta waste of $$$ loll no joke
LeFuckinGoat James! 🐐
I actually want to see this!
dang... Warner Bros really like implementing IPs into stuff as of late i.e Lego Batman Movie, Ready Player One
YOOO WHY IS WAR MACHINE PLAYIN BASKETBALL HAHAHAHAHA
LeBron James sucks!
WTF did I just watch?
This has zero of the charm the original had.
Man, the number of sjw filtering in this trailer is just ridiculous.
Wtf. Is WB getting out of ideas for movies? What is this shit??
LeBron: "What, In The Matrix Hell"   Me:  "i need my movie ticket's"
Can I just say Don Cheadle is nailing the villain role in this trailer.
Seems like a huge piece of crap
yessssssssss
Don't need a sequel to that classic
this needs a 'sing song when i'm walking home jump up to the top, lebron"
THIS LOOKS MADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD CORNY!
Can’t even lie I was ready to hate but this shi looks fire as hell
TRASH
It looks great to me can't wait to check it out Hell ya way go LBJ
Are y’all really gonna ignore how hard granny went in the end?
No thanks.. James too political, can’t watch this knowing he’s in it. Bleh!
Where is small chungus?
i miss the og cartoon network
Never thought I’d be disappointed to see a Space Jam trailer.
Michael Jordan after watching this: And That’s When I Took It Personally
Que que há velhinho 🇧🇷🇧🇷
i remember being too scared to watch space jam because michael jordan loses the first battle. yep....
Still kinda mad they took out the Skunk man, but I'm hyped for this ngl
Nothing can compare to the original but this looks good ngl
Granny? I was hoping for Penelope Pussycat. Oh, well. At least they brought back the original Lola Bunny.
Bruh why they gotta be doing basketball again? They could’ve done literally anything else
Michael Jordan is still the best but I look forward to seeing Lebrons take
Good thing King James didn't fell into Westeros!
👉https://youtu.be/GLU8jeQO7kA
first movie was better
WB: Pepe is too much of a sexual pest we're taking home out of the movie.  Also WB: Includes main character from A Clockwork Orange

#RESTORETHESNYDERVERSE
I wonder if Michael Jordan will be mentioned in this.
I refuse to watch any Looney Tunes project that doesn't feature Pepe Le Pew ☝️☝️ This is hipocrisy at its best
This looks like is going to be a cringe festival
Ngl this movie is probably going to flop
I aint no furry. But lola...LOLA WHAT DID THEY DOOOOO!?!?
I dont personally watch basketball.. but i cant help the feeling this shouldve been kobe......
Why the CGI though? Cartoons for life
#restorethesnyderverce
I love this already
Hell yeah!
This'll definitely help increase the Lola Bunny merchandise! 😁😁😁
his son is like opposite of bronny james
Look how they massacred Lola bunny
WOW!
#continuethemonsterverse
is this the movie he bent down on his knees to China for ?
Imagine Kobe doing this and we all just miss him more
Me reacting to this trailer @0:28
Looks like complete garbage
Ready player one 2.0
Fun fact: LeBron James played professional basketball for 18 years in preparation for this role
Looks lame as hell
this is starting to seem like wreck it ralph the first move Good, but the second movie ehhh
boom your looking for this
Granny got some old school moves
Horrible acting... eh
We are in the matrix
Where is my boy Marvin??
Where is kawhi?
Ready Player Space Toon Bron
If this movie doesnt have a good soundtrack, it will suck... part of what made the first one so good is it had a killer soundtrack
Definitely not worth watching. LeBron isn’t worthy enough to tie MJ’s shoes, let alone remake his movie.
WE WANT CONJURING THE DEVIL MADE ME DO IT
Hard pass
Why does this jus feel like the sequel to Ready Player One
Soon as I see this: no
Imagine in the future kids asking who is Lebron james then they will see this.
This looks terrible they tried way too hard and this is the outcome, ill stick to watching the original over and over.
this gonna suck do bad lol
1:18 Lebron recruiting players to beat the Nets
Wait wth is Kong doing here???
Not watching it just because of lebron
Space Jam + Ready Player One + Wreck-It Ralph. I’ll check it out
Is it just me or is his acting skills uh not very good?
Okie everyone so I know people had opinions on this trailer being terrible and all that stuff.  My opinion on this is try to give it a change,we may not know if this movie is good or not but what I known that the team working this did a fantastic work on this movie.So pls appreciate and respect for what they doing here.
Trash
I gave up basketball 🏀 training 10 yrs ago ..this movie is the only reason I will continue to play basketball again
If you dont waste money seeing this movie, Black Lives Matter is going to burn your Nieghborhood down. (And get away with it, Of Course!)
Really dude ??? Well , everyone wants to be like Mike
yeah, so, this looks like trash and is an insult to the original
#RESTORETHESNYDERVERSE 😭
IM BIG FAN SPACE JAM CAN'T WAIT  TO SEE IT
Lame
Not bad  👍
Just why! Why remake this classic movie? Why! Isn't the original space jam good enough, I give up man. FML
Is it just me or I’m happy as hell for this movie
Lola hon what they do to u 😭😭😭  Jk this movie looks cool
Wonder if they will do something for Kobe.
Ready Player 2 looks pretty interesting 🤔
I am not watching this unless big chungus makes a guest appearance.
Todo chulo pero sin Michael no es lo mismo, la primera es y siempre será una de mis pelis favoritas, debieron dejar a Michael Jordan
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Not hand drawn. Relies on outlier properties within the WB Universe to fill out the lack of original story. The opponents are essentially "super villains"(cashing in on another current trend). Just doesn't look good.
I THOUGHT ❄️ CANCELED LOONEY TUNES
>shitty 3D animations  Why?
Everyone: "it's Space Jam or Ready player One?!" Warner Bros: "YES"
Just hope this has good acting considering there’s a professional sports player in it.
Looks like trash
Is that the one basketball player that supports concentration camps in China and sponsored by Nike sweat shops?
this looks horrible omg nothing will compare to the original
This movie is goin to be shitty  compared to first one
Can't wait for the mashups with the new Space Jam theme
Michael Jordan: Ah shit, here we go again.
All this movie abt is lerborn finding his son
This brings bach so many memories
Did everyone else see big chungus
Biggest crossover of the decade
Doesn’t matter if you use the old character we loved. If you’re turning them into bland liberal agenda fools we’re not gonna watch.
They forgeted Godzilla.
This doesn't look as good as the original but it also looks as ridiculous as it needs to be to follow up such a ridiculous movie that ended up being a cult classic
Stop trying to make inclusivity happen. It’s not going to happen.
This looks dumb.
Imagine if MJ made an appearance 🙌🏽
no hold on why does lola look off in both cgi and 2d?? if you pause the frames shes in she looks really off model and out of place with the art styles the other characters have....
Wow This looks AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!! I CANT BELIEVE IT LOOKS THIS GOOD!!!! INSANE!!!!!!
The RL Grime track intro uff 🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥
He just doesn’t have the same charisma or acting ability as MJ
Is this a late april fools joke?
i mean okay not terrible but the hyper realistic models either need to be dumped all together preferable really or need serious touch up especially lola. 2d would look a lot better tbh you can even use 3d models but keep a 2d atmosphere but the hyper realism just no please
Hi guys from italy 🇮🇹 😊 👋
So basically it's Ready Player One with basketball.
Godzilla sent king Kong to the looney bin😂
This looks fucking terrible.
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
LeBron sucks it is bad
Everyone:shit looks cool Me:so war machine is the bad guy  Also me: Marvel x DC coming soon
i don’t like it.
They strategically time remakes so that lot of kids who watched the original now have kids to take and watch this movie.
No
Finally we get to see how people play basketball in ready player one
Looks terrible. Dont think it will even come close to the original.
https://youtu.be/CEcOb8jbC_8
Jordan fanboy pissed about this new space jam 😂. Man can you please appreciate the greatness of LeBron? Instead of hating him????
this looks so much fun👟🔥 🏀
looks like somebody's been stealing ideas from the power Ranger movie
hahaha lebron funny as hell
When did lj have time to film this ???
Great more trash
Woo woo
Cool
MJ: And I took that personally
The question being: Can Lebron be a worse actor than Michael?
I've never been more excited for a movie
It's Capin planet..
Holy crap, I can already tell this is gonna be a flop. Guys do yourself a favour and watch the original Space Jam, not this pretender🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀
No one gonna watch until you bring back the old lola bunny.  At this point I’d rather be down bad for grandma

What was grandmas job before the tunes
Matrix hell? XD
So murderers and rapists from other properties are ok, but not PePé Le Pew?
Lola can still get it
Since when did WB hav done of the avengers
Interesting
"Larry...that could've been me"... I'm sorry wrong movie...really though Space Jam isnt the same without Bill Murray (no offense Mr. Cheadle).  Let's go BULLS!!!....whup..
Toonpur ka superhero 👁️👄👁️
I know he's passing the ball at the end or Missing the last shot
FAIL
Space Jam should be a tradition in the NBA
I hit em high hit em high hit em high...
replaced MJ with BS activist LJ? Yeah, destroyed this movie. Not spending a dime on anything related to LJ... The sheep can though!
So aside from better graphics it's a remake?
Mj be like after lebron winning an award.....well you think he's a good actor....well ill show you that he's not....
Looks like wakanda
OMG AGHHGGGGGGGHHHHHH IM SO HYPED GO KING GO
First time i got goosebumps watching a cartoon
Youtube thought this was Looney Tunes: Back in Action😂😂😂😂
Kinda wish that they made it like the original Space Jam
*At least one of the Monstars should’ve been in this*
The iron giant is the same exact character model as ready player one
Wait since when in the fuck was Kong gonna be here
It’s not the same so i don’t want it
“Where’s Dom Don?”
Whats up doc
BrUh
This can either go well or be a complete flop and if there is no MJ cameo I will riot
1:38 wait did i just saw the mistery van from scooby doo?????
Damn looney Tunes
It's Don Cheadle from real life
OK, that was fun. Can't wait :)
Dont need to watch the movie, the trailer already showed everything.
Ooooo, so War Machine is setting up an Avengers crossover? Noice
Approved by the CCP.
I wish LeBron wasn’t animated it would’ve been better
I just hope the movie is ruined
No whipipo aloud
If kong is here that means he won the fight against godzilla.
I’m just here for Lola bunny
Ruin another classic....
A pure classic ruined.  There isn't much that is untouched these days. The future looks weak nothing new is good . Everything is being remade into trash
I guess some oppressed story will be told.

damn, I bet granny and Lebron will carry the team
Let’s take dogecoin too theeee moonnn!!
I don't know. It seems like they tried too hard or something. I'll definitely watch it but I feel like I'm going to be let down. But maybe I'm being too critical of a kids movie.
Imagine Kobe in here
Wack
looks like some soulless sensory overload garbage, the girl rabbit isnt even hot in this one
Stream Super Bass and help the Barbz reach another milestone of 1B views on YouTube.
Can my channel get recommended?
This is gonna flop so hard.  He don't have the Star power MJ did and pro sports don't have the numbers they used to.  And no Bill Murray?  Not during a pandemic.  Not ever.
Watch this be a 5% rotten tomato movie
Judging by the fact that big chungus is now canon to the looney toons universe because of their mobile game, hopefully we either see him or a reference to him in the movie
#justitsforlola
Can someone explain the Pepe Le Pew controversy that i see everyone talking about?
tbh jordan got better acting

kaya pala wla si bron sa lakers ngayon busy sa taping. hahaha
One thing I'm mixed about is that it's a street ball court, and not an actual stadium.

Ooo... Not.... Happy with the CG Looney Tunes. The whole Roger Rabbit effect was kinda the point. And the tone of this is bizarre. Kinda earnest and edgy for a LOONEY TUNES movie.
Am I the only one who doesn't get the concept of space jam? And why it has to do something with basketball? Plz help me Im really confused
I wanted to say that this movie seem to be a better version of the old one but MJ might message me cause he will take it personally.
Michael Jordan somewhere : “I’m fifty eeeeeeeeight!”
*Lebron James, Lebron James, Lebron James...*
Boom you looking for this
This looks so stupid
"crossover that nobody expect for"  i don't care about others people said, as a 90s kid, i'm in it's been awhile since space jam 1, and i miss bugs and the gang already
Add acting to the list of things Lebron James can't do.
Nostalgia
Kinda trash tbh space jam 1 is still a classic
Not cool, how they wrecked Lola 😞
why
Please for the sanity of parents don't release this movie, because kids are gonna want to watch it and parents are going to have to endure the remake of an already bad movie.
Looks like China is trying to MAKE ME like Queen James,  Stellar Acting. 🤣😂🤣
This is the emoji movie if it was ready player one
Looks like crap. Just another woke movie that will lose money. The original looks way better than this. Plus now they need to be so careful about their gender politics so I bet this one will be cringe as hell.
Lebron James is the new goat
#continuethemonsterverse
2:25 Shaq 's grandma
1st one is way better
Some people just want to see grown man cry.
2017 Kong   Skull  Island without the useless army wouldve been 7/10  i gave it   5/10      that was only for the  CGI  Kong  .  2019 Godzilla  was crap   3/10  2021      kong vs godzilla better   6/10 * Love & Monsters  2020  8.5/10 great movie want see  a remake asap  💯 back to america 2     4/10   was a bit  over  done  .  uno  that feeling  when your eatin too much candy & snacks  .
Nothing will replace the original woth Michael Jordan. He is trying but he will never be like mike!!! Hahahaha
So Hollywood really is like : Here you want some cgi with your cgi with a side of cgi with a cgi cherry on top. Our world is slowly being taken away from us
If there isn’t an ad for sprite cranberry I don’t wanna watch
Why even have Lola bunny should of just took her out
Unflushed toilet springs to mind......
LeBron, No matter how hard you try, you will never be Jordan.
They really had him 00:59
Spoiler alert 🚨lebron james gonna win his kid back !!!🤭
ah, another soundtrack that starting from "welcome to the ..."
This will probably happen in 10 years (the metaverse)
Why does this look like Ready Player One at the end?
Wow
Just for the joke, they should cast Michael Jordan in it, only it’s actually Michael B. Jordan. With Ryan Coogler involved it should be okay.
this is a bit  extra compared to the 90's space jam and futuristic but ill watch it. lbvs
This looks horrible. Nothing can beat the original
No Jordan cameo........
Is this a reboot ? Or a sequel
2:10 dwayne wade reference lol
LMAO NO WAY
They nerfed Lola bunny???
It releases on my birthday
Damn bugs bunny really recovered from his past rapeist self good on you bugs
I bet no one is going to complain about lack of white characters like black lies matter and that really shows how Anti-white people are 😂😂
People are going to debate which Space Jam is better, mark my words. These "fans" are crazy.
THEY BROUGHT KONG. AHHHHH
Lbj SAKALAM Pinas
I understand that the first Space Jam didn't have the BEST story ever, but it was a decent story with a good plot and conclusion. Based on the trailer alone, this seems like it's just going to be all over the place. They're going to jam too many cameos into the movie and it's going to be messy. Crazy corny looking ... We'll see once it comes out, but based on the trailer that shows so much already, I don't have the highest of hopes. I'm not getting the same energy as the first one and the animation is so digital, that it makes me feel like these Toon characters aren't themselves .. It's just whatever
Is anyone gonna point out the rapists in minute 2:23, I love Kubrick but what does A Clockwork Orange have to do with kids?
Oh bro if only  Kobe Bryant was in movie because this movie means so much to me
it would be even better if have pepe le pew and they made the lola bunny sexy like in 1996!
where the fuck is big chungus
LBJ the Goat
Nope
People like *mjs a better actor *bro the movie hasn't even came out yet
#synderrestorejusticeleague 2
Am i the only one who notice LeBron James acting skills are bad af ??😂😂
Where tf is big chungus
🤔... I like.
awful
Aw shit Ima get a new screen saver 🙌🏾
Ready Player One ordered on wish
China shill
I'm so excited to see this ......
Was that Fred flinstone 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Ok so Rhodey apparently become that guy
Plot: *WB saw the battle scene from Ready Player one and added Tune characters to it* yeah no
What idiot thought it was a good idea to make War Machine's actor be the villain in this one?
That's a shame that more time was spended to making 3D animation looking good, than restoring at least half of the quality of the original 2D animation, way more beatiful and visually intrusting...
Nice
Bugs bunny is a struggling rapist. Remember that
R-Kelly would give this movie a nice intro
2:23 didn't know kyrie was in this movie
Hanna Barbara Huckleberry Hound  Quick Draw McGraw  Top Cat
Warner Bros: what should we do, I'm bored. Employee: Play basketball? Warner Bros: That's it we make a looney tunes movies lots of other Characters and call it a day. Employee: but..... Warner Bros:Hey everyone get to work we got a movie to make
Welcome to the space jam 😍😉
Disney while watching this, "Oh boy, Things are getting out of hands. And what the hell is WarMachine doing over there??    Enters Mickey,  "Stop freaking out. Alright fine, I'll do it myself."
No monstars! This doesn't look promising.
This looks terrible But fun. Just like the original.
Space Jam - MJ stays as a live action person in the Looney Tune world and the Looney Tunes stay cartoon in the real world.  Space Jam 2 - Lebron turns cartoon in Looney Tune world, then turns real in a digital world. The looney Tunes turn CGI in the digital world whilst the rest of the cartoons stay cartoon.....   Makes sense. 👎
Really? A remake to a movie nobody liked to begin with. Kmt who make's this bollocks up.
I still can’t actually believe there making a space jam 2
Lebron and mj are great in there own era stop with this comparing mj engrained seeing a new movie he used to be in

One thing is for sure, that hairline cgi is better than josh Whedon's justice league superman mustache-less cgi
I like how Warner Bros. think that giving a female character boobs is considered "sexualizing," bring the old Lola Bunny back, it looked way better. The new one just looks like she's high on drugs.
rip lola bunnies art style
Fun fact: War Machine agreed to do this in exchange for Lebron to be in the MCU
No one: Yosemite Sam: **literally shoots the basketball** 😂😂You gotta love it
1:46 if iam not is it RDJ behind him🤔
This film is too black ...   Isn’t that how it works ? I’m new to the race card game ...
I have no intention to watch this movie but I’m probably going to anyways just to see if he actually recruits Superman
Lebron really want to over due mj. Or am I being a hater? https://youtu.be/VL3Yh1DxWfQ
0:54 is that Iron Man Friend or Tony Stank friend 🤔
Y’all ready for this cause I know I am
Lebron is such a wanna be MJ lmaooooooooo everyone else passed up this garbage roll because everyone knows you cant touch the original.
If it ain't michael jordan we dont want it! Oldschool we want original oldschool
Wb sucks..So you going to start a movie with a kid being kidnapped...........yea figures. Much better plot would have been an intergalactic basketball tournament where we play against other beings who are bent on taking over the NBA!
Can't wait to see!
nice.
This movie will jam 100% sick and badass. 🏀🔥
This will be pure shit, im rly sorry for old school fans....
HELL YEAH A SECOND SPACE JAM..!!!!!!!! I REALLY HOPE IT HOLDS UP WITH THE ORIGINAL  THERES SO MANY SHOWS AND CARTOONS IN HERE ALREADY YESSS ;O;
It’s so crazy to see how much cgi has changed through the years
Oh my god mannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn I’ve waited along time for this right here man
Warner bros : pepe le pew who was kinda pushy when it came to a cat who he mistook for a skunk and always got his ass kicked by her is gone forever cause he is a problem.  Also warner bros : the four drogues from clock work orange that raped a woman to the tune of singing in the rain are totally awesome and deserve to be court side during the big game in the movie
I can’t wait to see this
Me: its been to fucking long :)
I dont like how they spoiled that slam dunk scene
What didn't need remaking... space jam didn't need remaking. Get some new ideas.
if y’all haven’t watched the first one i- 😭✋
So Mike just needed the toon squad to beat the monstars. Lebron needs King Kong and Superman. Sounds about right
Visually movie looks cool. Yes all the pop culture references. Conceptually Disney is planting ideas in the collective 👁
Im just watching for the live animation the plot seems forced
Welcome 2 jam 7.16.21
1:40 Is that a Game of Thrones dragon??
Space Jam:Frumpy Bunny
She kick ball, foul
Imagine calling Lebron James “dad”
This will be super cringe
Utter shite
Ok
Where is booba?
Can’t believe they didn’t use Allen Iverson (aka A.I.) as the man playing the A.I. (Artificial intelligence) 🤦🏽
Hopefully they pull a Rocky and lose the game. That would be refreshing.
ok im down for this
Nice movie
Bro i hope we at least get a kobe tribute or just a lil easter egg or somethin bro
Nothing can pass the OG space jam.
And here they go ruin another classic
Watch donkey wars everyone. Best video ever
Bhaisaab ye kis line me agye aap
It will not even come close to the first one, It will have mixed reviews. Sorry but its just too late to make a second movie.
lola wade
space jam 2 trailer release :   LeBron hairline : AIGHT LET'S TIME TRAVEL
Looks ok, kids movies in the 80-90s were special though. They had heart and originality. Im still glad this is coming out.
Iron Giant is in this movie?! Can’t wait!
Where’s big chungs
LETS GOOOOO JAMMMMM
How much you wanna bet, they are removing a lot of comments. MJ is the real King!! #23
Ready Player One rip off anyone?
Oh I cant wait for Ryan George to Pitch this! So do you have a movie for me? Yessir! I do! A jam made in space?!
This is so fucked up, I love it
P pm l
This shoulda been Kobe's movie...
they literally could’ve chose someone much better den lebron...😬 micheal should take this very personally.
Gtfoh!
...... idk how I feel about this yet. Gotta process it.
All of this wouldn't have happened if they would've went to the right floor
senior old lady : break dancing and proceeds to kick the ball and score 30 points 2:28  LeBron and Steph : wait that's illegal  2:32
STOP SHOWING THE WHOLE STORY IN 1 TRAILER.
Where the fuck is bill murray
tbh this doesn't look good
MJ needs to make a cameo...
Ooh interesting! Michael Jordan never turned into a cartoon himself in the original. That was a cool addition for this one.
What the fuck do i have looked now.
No Keith Van Horn?
Loved the Original and this looks good!
Wow... Y'all totally fucked that up. Too bad to cause the graphics are top quality so they could have made a good movie. Get a real basketball player. Lebron needs to go do crying about all the persecution and financial hardship he's suffered in white America. Oh wait...he hasn't experienced any of the stuff he gripes about. Go have a conversation with Oprah and some royal family that's not even from America to know about what's what here
https://youtube.com/channel/UCdIIuxV9FYMK6E3WK7iyY8g
Space Ready Player 1
Wish it were Kobe
Bit stiff Bron
Big Chungus lookin different here🤔...
Nyc
This year Warner Bros is better than Disney
Ready player one much?
Where is Pepe le Pew?
I just realsied that this will be the first time that 2D animation will be on the big screen since TTG the Movie which came out in 2018
This feels like Ready Player One mixed with Pixels but it’s just Warner Brothers properties
y’all gassin this up like this won’t be a cheese fest like the original one was
Really good video
Granny rule34 pls
2:10  Lola lookin kinda bad
I’m not really a basketball or looney tunes fan, but this looks sick! A little worried about the live action versions of the tunes tho
wow 😍😍😍😍😍
This trailer is racist against white peoples
Justicia for Jonny Deeb :v Hamber is biche
Just gonna put #RestoretheSnyderVerse right here and have a nice day.
This looks fire
I see lebrons acting gonna be stale
How can this movie look like it has worse effects than the one from 20 years ago?
Big Chungus is in this movie?!
Omg yet another iron giant cameo. God I wish they made an iron giant sequel😩
Could some one put the original soundtrack from first space gam onto this trailer?
*BRON LEGACY*
Bro why did they show the entire movie in a trailer. I’m sure the first half was enough??? Not exciting when all the visuals are given at once
I SAW THE MASK
MJ gonna drop another series on Netflix because of this.
Cameo MJ can’t wait
This looks like a fun care-free movie to watch with the kids. There are not a lot of those, you know!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️
looks stupid
THEY HAD TO ADD THE WINK AHAHAH
Trash
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Another movie to skip. Thanks.
So none of this is real because its happening inside evil Don Cheadles computer, it's all just a simulation. Unlike Jordan's SJ.
#restorethesnyderverse
I'll pass... something James doesn't love.
i luv zendaya
Ready Player One meets Looney Toons
This is not football grandma
Im strongly convinced that the water goonstar is Klay Thompson and not the fire goonstar
1 question is Zion in the movie?
Love the trailer but WB, PLEASE #RESTORETHESNYDERVERSE
yesssss
damn RIP Pepe.
No thanks
I'm sure the movie will be fine but THAT is the storyline? So it's not even in the same world, it's not a similar threat, and not the same cast. There was no reason to call it Space Jam. Space isn't even involved. Dude gets zapped into some server. Space Jam was called Space Jam because the aliens came from SPACE to challenge the toons and JAM in basketball.  But that's just my oppinion.
So it's Hook meets Ready Player One....I'm torn.

Lola looks like shit. Childhood ruined.
Lebro, professional victim GOAT!
I’m not going to see this as the Lebron James Space Jam... this is the Don Cheadle Space Jam.
Cuando en Colombia?
Lola bunny was ruined
The MonStars themed from NBA stars gave a different vibe though, but these new villains ain't that bad.
This reminds me of ready player one with all the pop culture references
Alright so Don Cheadle holds a celebrity's son for ransom and forces him to help some furries win a basketball game
Feel like it's just gonna be another way hollywood ruins a classic
I will miss Lola Bunny's old design 😔 But this one doesn't seem too bad
So you tell me. We can MEET YOUR FAV CHARACTERS- and YOU WANNA GET HIM BACK? - sorry not sorry dad. Let me in: xd I'm fiiinnnneeee- xDDD
Looks like garbage
https://youtu.be/FoUsDnDAnqM
Lebrons CGI hairline looks so real
I want pe pe Le pew and speedy Gonzales in this one :( stupid censorship and complainers !
Why couldn’t it be the 14, my birthday 🙁🙁
*Ruined Lola Bunny*
I’m so upset at how bad this looks. Was born in 1990. Space jam was my childhood . And I love lebron. Man, I hope I’m wrong
small chungus
So this is what War Machine does in his spare time? Cool.
The original was better
2:23 2k playshots be like
Dislikes Are All Jordan Fans LOL
Who's this bargain bin poor man's Michael Jordan?
Jakee
#restoretheznyderverse
Lebron such a sellout to China.
Straight trash
Ooof looks bad
#savepepelepew
So this one's about hacking the mainframes and servers and glitching the matrix or whatever? I thought it was supposed to be about looney tunes? But now featuring king Kong? Lol
2:06 Big Chungus😂😂
Lezze if its good
Bleh .....
like I get that it's alluding to a bron and d wade picture, but I feel like every wink and look from lola bunny in promotional material is essentially saying "ya, I know I was your first boner."
Shouldn’t it be internet jam?
I ain't watching until there is anime
The second I saw iron giant I lost all hope
I made a song please tell me if it’s good
Why couldn't they just do it like the first one!? Why add the weird wreck it Ralph and ready player one elements... and 3d animated for the cartoon characters it lame too.
#Restorethesnyderverse
Ultimate decider in the lebron v Jordan debate
1:25 classic looney tunes humor right there
Is this what that Skrull meant
Sorry but, this remake won’t be able to get to the level of the classic 🤷🏽
So basically tron kinda? Giving me those vibes
This is a joke
Eh
Releasing in January
"How do we have a lesson about doing your own thing, and then not doing that cause the kid gets impressed by basketball skills?"
That was awful.
im so rdy for this!!
Lebron space jams
This looks like shit
I would love to see a Babylon 5 character in the mix but only about seven actors from the original cast are still alive. The rest have traveled beyond the rim. 😔
No
If Kobe still alive I think he is also participate in this movie...rest in peace black mamba.
What is with the FFX Blitzball music in the beginning? Why is 2D Bugs so poorly animated? And where is Bill Murray?
I wish they would have kept the characters hand drawn instead of 3D 😭😭😭
I love how the bad  guy was from fresh Prince of bel air
This movie's existence is somehow EVEN MORE INSANE than the first one...
i KnOck br0 oUT . hE WAS bEInG TOo cRAZY !
I think 1:25 got at least a little giggle out of all of us
Whole movie in a trailer LOL
Nope! Jordan did it better. The trailer alone confirms it.
Who is the water basketball villain
Whow what a trailer man full off enjoyment yeah I love it with old memories 💖💖
After I watched the original you know what I said I think in 20 years they should  remake it cause why not maybe 2 times a charm
Im 36
wheres the hand drawn art what the fuck, they all turn into 3D models what is this bullshit
Why cant they wait to make this movie until his career is over? Seems a little pre mature.
Why are they even doing this
https://youtu.be/UnLzjQGBeCQ
The Iron Giant was the best part about this trailer.
Obvious rip-off of RP1 and you can't kick a basketball on the court.

Ok first of all THANK YOU FOR BRINGING BACK NOSTALGIC CHARACTERS and thank you for the sequel we have been waiting for years can’t wait to see this it seems like the movie we have been waiting for and it heck worth it
Some many warner brother's characters
I feel like MJ is a better actor.
Dude they HAD the perfect animation... Then they turn it into detective Pikachu/ready player One type bullshit.
Disgusting
LeBron James is the face of Chinese slavery.
0:44 Super Smash Bros Brawl  Subspace Emissary
Its not the same when lola aint thicc
I pray to God I hope this pandemic can end so we can all watch space jam 2 together. This looks pretty good for a film.
Pennywise in 1:46
If they stayed home we wouldn't have to watch this
Seeing Lebron act in his own movie is hilarious😂😂
Not the same without Bunny tits. 😂🤷‍♂️
Meh
Sooo this is ready player one : sports edition?
This is awesome

MJ did it first.
CHANGE LOLA NOW!!!😡        or else.
1:46 if you go into 0.25 speed you can see pennywise from it on the right side
I really hope this movie uses the whole movies clashing theme that ready player one largely ignored. We got glimpses of movie characters like the iron giant and King Kong and the delorean from back to the future. But I really do want to see all of these different properties mashed together meeting each other. In the trailer alone I can see game of thrones characters, matrix characters, pennywise, the mask, the penguin from Batman returns, mr. freeze from Batman forever, the flying monkeys from wizard of oz, the animated cast from Scoob, and the Warners from animaniacs. Tons and tons of Hannah barbera cartoon characters. I hope for more than just cameos.

Is that Don Chedale
I’ve never really liked Lebron but this looks really good
Everybody grab your popcorn this summer gone be lit  When this releases  Eating 🍿 and drinking Cacti Drink
1:46 is that pennywise on the right?
Ummmm.... idk, they should have done it with Michael Jordan instead. This really doesn't have the space jam vibe. It has more of a video game that is still in development that might not make it to be produced
Sorry, not sorry. I am biased for the first movie. Yet of course i want to still see it.
Ready Player One: Basketball
It's been forever since I saw the original movie. I have no interest in seeing this one. Maybe for the younger generations this will be awesome. I still haven't watched the Jumanji movies. The first one was fine for me.
❤
Looks like some mj's fan boys are bitter right now😂😂😂😂
Let’s be honest, this is gonna suck. You can’t capture the same magic as the original. Especially if all they’re gonna do is shoehorn in a bunch of WB properties like Iron Giant and Scooby Doo.  And they’re doing CGI for the Toons. Come on guys. Part of the charm was seeing the animated characters standing next to real people. Also, no Jordan? I know he’s in his 50s and can’t really play. But he could’ve been the coach for the Toons. Just another shameless cash grab by selling our nostalgia.
2:05
So this is in Ready Player One universe?
Syrup anyone?
Get ready to jam again. But this time, with the King himself.
I’m sorry, but I’m not really interested in watching a movie with Lebron James ...
This looks good
dumb af he's a cartoon. warm
R.i.P Pepe le pew Sad🥀☹️
anyone knows which song is this?
Garbage
ready player1?
cringe
#RestoreTheSnyderverse
2:11 😘
Why did they make them 3D
Trash
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
This is shit
What in the Ready Player One knock off?!
Why waste time making this!?
I swear I've seen this already...but Hollywood wouldn't be lasy and make another remake to afford those new yachts...nawww.
This looks stupid... but I’ll still watch it 😔
Why are you reading this comment in your voice? I don’t sound like that!
Y’all massacred my girl, why my girl looks ain’t THICC no more cmon man
LeBron can act better than MJ fosho lol
Nice kjngjames
Warner Bros. Pictures presents, a new comedy from director Malcolm D. Lee and producer Ryan Coogler.
So this is where Drogon went.
Basicly tron but with cartoons
*”What in the matrix hell?”*
Wheres Pepe Le Pew
I love how people (so far) seem to love or hate this movie
this is a example of how out of ideas Hollywood is
Just KEEP LOLA TBE SAME SHE LOOKS LIKE A GUY NOW
HONESTLY CAN’T WAIT
Maybe 2021 is WB year lol
Great imagery, though it has no soul.
I’m so excited to see this movie. Space Jam is my favorite movie of all time. I can’t wait to see the second one. 😍🏀🚀🛸🌌🐰🥕
Garbage #fnba
The peaceful coast pertinently choke because government aerobically zip modulo a warlike cooking. limping, used card
China
Is that the Lebron James kid? acting next to Lebron James?!!??
This actually looks pretty cool
Nope
that looks AWESOME I've GOTTA go see it
We were robbed of fully modeled Lola Bunny tits.
comments were turned off on the Russian page, as I understand it, the "remake" was not appreciated there
MOOOONNNKKEEEEEEEYYYYY
Definition of Cringe worthy.
The 2021 movie looks worse than 1996, well done, that's an achievement. Ah, well, the whites were deliberately moved away from the cameras, do you seriously think this is not striking?
"The Matrix" Ooph that hurt, it's clearly Tron.
What
Ekkkkk I feel like a big kid! I can’t wait to see this 😆.
The internet: Infinity War is the most ambitious crossover of all time! Bugs Bunny: Ehhh, what’s up doc?
Wheres Taz?
same exact giant robot thing from ready player one
I’m suppose to be the audience this is catering to and no thanks. Lebron can shove this movie up his ass.
Space Jam: A New Legacy... and that’s when I took it personally.
Is it just me or does the new Space Jam feel like a basketball themed Ready Player One movie.
This stinks more than Pepé Le Pew... Before he was cancelled.
Man's really said what in the matrix hell😂😂😂
The first part of this looked like a Ready Player One ripoff lol
Warner Brother Making 3D Looney Tunes Live Action Hybrid Movie like that For.
I feel like I just watched the whole movie.
That lola buny... rip
This sucks hard
Bruh they really have the “a clockwork orange” guys in this movie
looks like garbage. GGz
They should have given MJ a cameo.
WOW they ruined space jam with this
this dude is trying to be like Michael Jordan ...........wow................ he doesn't even know how to act what a waste
Boring...😒👎🏻
Bro this ready player one rip off actually looks good
Crap.. I might actually like this movie.. :-/
looks kind atrash..
Come back to this comment after the movie: female rabbit will go ultra instinct feminism and dominate anyone on the court, has the best one ups, and act like a real douche bag
If MJ doesn’t show up ima be mad mad
LeBron James da goat
Big chungus better be in this
I won’t pay to see this with LeBron James in it.
1:46 you can see IT the clown
Ayyyy it comes out on my birthday!
Bugs, Daffy  and Porky: “That’s All Folks!” (Lebron pulls up the curtain) Lebron: “Can I go home now?”
Can't wait
This is going to flop as hard as Bron dose.
Time 2 turn up the heat this summer🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀👑👑👑👑🎞🎞🎞🎞🎞🎞🎞📽📽📽📽
Pls let me see yakko wakko and dot plsss I will be so happy
Lola looks really creepy- is it just me?
Editor: So what effects do you guys want in the movie?  Warner bros: Yes.
This actually looks amazing! I can't wait to see it
If Space Jam theme song is not in the film, is remotely illegal to premiere this movie.
وين العرب
Meh
Surely they would add a team lebron would have to play against in like a grand final and in the other team there would be mj.
I personally would of preferred curry instead of Lebrun 🔥 is only 1 Jordan 😂
Ready player one basketball edition
Ok I'm hyped. Yes I'm 42 soo
They did the girl Lola dirty 😬
looks horrible
I’m so mad they are trying to reboot this
Alright get ur bets in what cameos from the old movie are gonna make it ✋😲💵  Micheal Jordan’s long arm reference. The monStars return. Bill Murray for some reason... A call back to the weirdly sexualized Lola scene.
He really made them call him king James lol
Looks meh
is this really what we waited for?
Damn how good is Bronnys weed?
Lebron: "what did you do to my son"  Me: "what did you do to Lola"
damn, there at least should be a Michael Jordan cameo lol
IT WAS ME BERRY!!
Respect to Warner Bros for referencing Game of Thrones in this movie. It would be the last franchise I would expect to be referenced in a kids movie. Lol
Thanks, I hate it
Sooo Yosemite Sam's real guns aren't controversial for this movie but they are for the new Looney Toons cartoon?? Pick a lane people 🤦‍♀️
Ew that's gross
What do End Game and Space Jam have in common? ❌. They're crossover event from their franchises. ✔️. They both have Don Cheadle.
The Splits Must Be In The Movie     (But no the 2019 ones)
1:39 Warner Bros. Films Referenced again just like Ready Player One
2:24 WHY ARE THE PEOPLE FROM CLOCKWORK ORANGE HERE
Makes zero sense. Just makes me appreciate the original even more.
this is gonna be awesome, my goat working it good. 10 out of 10 on this trailer PERIODTT
When Beta is available,  I will just toss it into garbage can... and yell Jordan! Jaja
Hopefully Lebron doesn’t trade any of his teammates
1:43 Migo, Meechee, and Gwangi from Smallfoot!
Ahh atleast Yosemite Sam Aka Sam the Terrible didn't get canceled. And my boy Foghorn Leghorn made the team. BUT PLEASE let BILL MURRAY show up in the last quarter!!!
Which players talents did the goon squad take in this one?
Dope
Tbh I love Lola’s new look
wtf  I know it’s April fool lol
I won't watch anything with a self proclaimed hater of white people; LeBron James.
Lebron: I need to assemble an elite team to help me. Jordan: Just give me Bill Murray and Newman. Lebron always needs an elite team to win.
What is there so much hate centered around one man?
animation looks rushed  plot line as boring as the original  really... 3d?  tries to be funny  2/10
Space Ready player Jam?
I hope this doesn't suck. Please!!😭🙏🏾
Imagine a gag where they had the whole secret stuff thing from the first one but the secret stuff is...                *a sprite cranberry*
Space jelly
AAAAWWWWWWWWWEEEEEEEESSSSSSSOOOOOOOMMMMMMEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!....................... 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Not diggin’ it
If you rearrange the letters in “depression” you get “I pressed on.” Don’t ever give up. Your breakthrough is almost here.
This movie gonna tank so bad🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wow he from avengers
he doesn't have Jordan's acting skills
How could people dislike this
How can u dunk if u kneelin
Why people hating? Imma watch it for that iconic Wade and James photo.
So this is where Rhodey went after the Endgame.
Soooooooo excited
Sick trailer
Suffering succotash... the new 2k game looks lit.
Shoutout to RL Grime - Scylla as the background music
The original raised me. I'm so excited
Damm
Who is LeBron James??
I actually like this this Lola better than the other one.
I'm waiting for big chungas
It must drive Lebron nuts to be Jordan’s shadow
here's to you cancel culture for forcing Warner Bros. to take pepe out......🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻
uhhhhh... i dont know about this one. Im sure its just its targeted audience is 10 im assuming
Michael from discovery still whisper talking 😂
This looks 🔥🔥🔥. Some people will say it’s bad regardless but I’m hyped for this
gotta feeling the studio that make ready player one is the one behind this movie graphics.
Bring back thicc Lola! #notmylola
Some movies were just not meant to be remade.
1:06 GEAR THIRD
REMEMBER, TRON LEGACY
This looks dope
Granny out here giving black widow vibes. This movie looks too good already, cant loose with Don Cheadle
Great its got the crying captain from discovery in it... no thanks.
Yakko, Wakko, & Dot are making a cameo in this movie, I'M SO EXCITED
Who Excited for his Masterpiece?
Where is the Song with the " welcome yo the space jam" ??  Help
They ruined it because nobody wants to see lebron as a cartoon
Wouldn't it be dope if they never made this movie in the first place
Poor child lol you do you
Lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😹😹😹😹😹
War machine and lebron in the movie nice
I'll pass
Acting is Horrible..😂😂
Marvel "infinity war is the most ambitious crossover event in history" warner bros: hold my beer
It would be a massive missed opportunity if Dwayne Wade doesn’t “become the Flash” somehow.
O primeiro marcou minha infância!!! Estou muito hypado 😂❤️🏀🏀
And there's no Super Mario and Sonic The Hedgehog Character in Space Jam: A New Legacy!!!!!?????
They better keep similar themes as the first movie. Or else it’ll ✨suuuuuuck✨
This movie is gonna be ASS
Why am I so down for this movie?
Gay.
Check out this Roblox vid https://youtu.be/xdWE5D7yVDQ
Did anyone see penguin joker the mask mr freeze?
This trailer just shows how dumb movies have become in 25 years.
Lola Bunny looks extra lovely with those enhanced graphics. Who doesn’t love Lola Bunny?
THE GREATEST CROSSOVER IN HISTORY
trash trash trash 🗑
Wait in Space Jam: A New Legacy, they adding a References and Cameos like Animaniacs, Scooby Doo and Flintstones and Others!!!!!!??????
im i in the movie?
This honestly looks horrible.
Wonder how mr. Jordan feels bout this
So is this ready player one 2 or...?
anyone else thinks it's odd they have some guys dressed up like clockwork orange characters in a kids movie?? 2:23
Bugs is such a bro, but this is DEF the wrong voice for him
Why is Lola not hot anymore
I really don't want damian lilard to be the villian
Bro all they need to do to win is to drink Micheal Jordons secret stuff
The freaking space jam remix tho SHEEEEEESH
I'll watch it but it's going to suck
Stupid.
LeTrash
Wish it didn’t have Lebron James in it.
Oh man I just spotted Pennywise at 1:46 at the right of the trailer
So they basically took another iconic film and are using it to push Black Lives Matter movement!  Just stop trying to remake movies that no one wants remade and using them to push agendas. They’ve already fucked up Candyman and that’s bad enough!
Nothing will ever top the original Space Jam.
oof
the original had a better story. they removed pepe le pew, dont sexualize lola bunny its offensive but kept yosemite sam with his guns. so shooting in large gatherings is not offensive. idk kids might pick it up🤣 as mass shootings is normal. wait it is. karens where are you.
The return of Lola bunny
Steven Spielberg: what the hell
Ready player space jam
I thought the animaniacs will be on there
I love this
Let's see: they should have made Shaquille O'Neal the lead, used cel-shaded CGI for the Looney Tunes, they should have tried to replicate the cel animation better, they should have made Lola at least look athletic, and what the mother- Malcolm D. Lee is directing this? Suddenly, I want Justin Lin back as director.
Lebron trying to act.
This loki look fire but how tf the first Space Jam even get to this
Yeah seems about right
I can’t wait until they make another one of these in 30 years with someone that will be named “Carl” or something
Trash
Got Dame as a robot 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can’t wait for this one WB 🔥🎬
Looks terrible
Go sub DC Heat, kid is almost at 1 million
Those thumbs down are rookie numbers. Let's bump it up
They say Michael Jordan is at the game but it’s actually Michael B Jordan that makes an appearance
Bron made a movie while still being a top player in the league and I'm just here eating chips
is there a space jam 3 in the future
2:25 Go, Granny!!!
I don’t know how I feel about this....some movies just don’t need to be remade just my opinion
Ok ok this looks good . Pls don’t be the next Tom and Jerry movie 🥺
Everyone is going to be watching the first Space Jam movie now again. WB going to be making Mo Money, Mo Money, Mo Money!!!
There are so many things wrong with this movie and evil don cheedle is surprisingly not one of them
Woke jam!
Omg
Can we all be honest, if Bill Murray ain’t out here breaking goon ankles, Lebron ain’t got a shot at winning this game!!!
2:06 big chungus in the crowd I'm not kidding
Lebron about to destroy his entire legacy over some busted ass kid😭😭 Jordan would never
This is ready player One X space jam
What happened to Lola?
I’m still mad about the original Space Jam website being taken down.
YOHANAN(JOHN/JUAN) 14:6 "I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE. NO ONE COMES TO THE FATHER EXCEPT THROUGH ME" "YO SOY EL CAMINO Y LA VERDAD Y LA VIDA. NADIE VIENE AL PADRE SINO POR MI"........
The movies called Space Jam new Legacy so where are the Tiny Toons?
Looks dumb
If you wanna help this 1 guy out subcribe to haze montana quicksand
How dare you stand where he stood!
I’m still mad that they NERFED Lola
This looks really terrible , but it’s space jam so we *have* to like it
Am I that fucking old now dear god help me
What the fuck are Kong and Drogon doing there
Definitely not watching this garbage 😂
15k dislikes. Didn’t know that many Nets fans existed
Who’s ready for it to come to Netflix
Absolutely moronic.
MEMBER EVERYTHING?
🗑
Look at the views for 1 day 😲
The Next ⛹🏻‍♂️
Lebron is a better actor than Jordan. . . hands down.
I guess I'll watch it lol
Should've used bryce
King James🔥💯
I can't wait for this movie it's finna be lit
WB: How many guest characters do you want? Ryan Coogler and Malcom Lee: Yes
Lola really was killed. This movie gonna suck.
There better be other basketball players rather than lebron
Ready player one but its with Lebron James
Tuff 🔥🤙🏽
Thanks for showing me the whole movie summed up in a trailer!
Barkley better do a chaos dunk this time
This might be the dumbest shit I've ever seen
The NBA also made sure LeBron won a championship before the trailer dropped and it was vital he was a Laker too.
Of course grandma is highlighted because were in the MILF culture smh...
The first space jam had such a fun feel to it. This feels like what 2016 ghostbusters was to the originals
Would of been better if it was a continuation of the original and not another stupid reboot.
This is a perfect example of history always repeating it's self. The new generation will get to experience what the last did in Hollywood. Batman, Spiderman, horror, and even Space Jam. The world we live in is the same experience over and over just certain little aspects of it change.
JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY. 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 (KJV)  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
THIS MOVIE LOOKS SO FIRE IM SO EXCITED
WB: *Makes Lola Bunny less sexual* R34 Artists: “Fine, I’ll do it myself.”
Lebron will always play second to Michael..
Se ve muy emocionante🤩
Can't just leave well enough alone. Space jam is not a movie that should be made over... Going to hit the thumbs down on this one chief
2021 Cinema, only black men))))
So, Pepe Le Pew can't be in this because he's considered a "sexual predator" in the "Me Too" era, but they literally have Alex DeLarge and his gang of droogs from A Clockwork Orange, actual rapists and murderers, making a cameo at 2:22 in this "family-friendly" movie.  Good to know where your priorities are, Warner Bros.
Weirdly adorable?
Look how they’ve massacred my boy.
Yikes
Hola guy’s  You are a beautiful and fun family and you are amazing family I love you always hugs and kisses to you all 💋💋💋💋😊😊💋💋🌷🌷🌷
Ehhhh this a no for me doc
Que carajos hace Kong ahí????
YIKES.
Not gunna lie looks likes its gunna be a Ok movie nothing great
Hahahaha Disney doesn't have this movie mashup
Lebron should have a China Jersey on and they should play against sweatshop working children
This movie doesn't seem like it'll do a great job balancing both worlds like the original.
Welcome to the space jam !!!
The bron jame
The remake we didn’t need
0:38 a wizard of oz reference?
Nigahiga's fake trailer is way better
1:30 Oh my god Samity Sam still has his guns!?
I always knew Lebron would be a great actor because he's always such a drama queen.
Ok...I dont know why I see so many people hating on it...yes we get it it's not MJ but this shit looks dope
I’m getting ready player one flashbacks
1:45 pennywise the clown is in the crowed for a second as the dude yells
Seriously this looks like trash I was actually excited to see this til I seen the trailer. No monstars. No mj. Lebron lame ass. Meh hard pass
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Wtf is drogon doing here
W.
Based on the trailer, this movie seems corny and forced. The first movie had charm, flowed nicely and was very well written. This movie seems more like a cash-grab, and comes across as a watered down version of the first movie; just with a simplistic 'Win basketball game to save your son' plotline; along with a bunch of flashy GCI and pop culture references to overcompensate for poor writing. I'd maybe consider watching it if it was on one of the movie channels, but I'm in no rush to see it.
Lebron James is a way better actor than Michael Jordan. Movie looks good.
AMOOO, LOVE LOVE, ORGINAL MUSIC SPACE JAM 1 and SPACE JAM 2 QUAD CITY DJs
1:12 it's clear they went all out with the research in this movie, for instance look at the dossier forms for the tunes, it shows that their date of birth was the year they each debuted from a short/movie! so excited!
1:25 The OTHER kind of shoot, cowboy!!
This is racist, no white people
Changing Lola's image is like telling a woman in reveling clothes to cover up.
I’m really not interested in seeing this movie, it looks ridiculous and I’m hearing the song from the original movie. Couldn’t they write something new.
Theaters better be open by the time this comes out 🤞🤞
. The     ,hf,lndpnlp
Lolia bunny looks like aas
The new movie is going to be awesome especially with different graphics it definitely seems way different than space jam one
This movie better not disappoint....
This Ain't even worth watching!!!!🤦
Needs more R. Kelly!
just so long as we don't see the Tunes get repeatedly beat up in this one
They clearly ripped off Ready Player One.  Yet another sequel that will only make you love the original that much more. 👍
This is gonna bomb
Iboga rootbarks, iboga Hcl , Iboga TA ,Ibogaine Available now
We better be getting a Kobe Easter egg of some sort.
That last basket was some bs it was a kick ball
ON MY BROTHERS BIRTDAY awesome n lits se what mj says
I wonder bugs and the others still remember micheal jordan. I would really like micheal jordan to be mentioned in this movie
This reminds me of ready player one
Did Truck-Kun killed Lebron, so he have an Isekai Basketball with the Tunesquad?
James sucks
🥺and pepe le pew?
Space Jam: Ralph Breaks The Internet
I wonder how the Communist Party in China will "Edit" the poster to shrink Lebron or put him out of the poster while enlarging the rest of the cast... remember the Chinese Star Wars Force Awakens poster anyone?
Was not James injured? o,o
I mean.... Iunno. Why is this a Space Jam sequel? To extend it a bit, why does it have the same moniker? I get that they couldn't just recycle the plot from the first one for the sake of being original but... Why does this exist? From my understanding it doesn't even have like a "space" setting, it's just a weird AI VR simulation program or... Whatever. I don't know. I'm sure some will like it, but I'm just not feeling this one.
All the Characters I could see: 0:35 Westeros-GoT 0:37 Wizard of Oz 1:21 Bugs wearing Marvin’s Helmet 1:33 Jetsons in their ship 1:33 Kong 1:33 Foghorn Leghorn wind compass 1:33 Dino 1:38 Animaniacs Water Tower 1:38 Mystery Machine  1:40 Iron Giant 1:42 Drogon GoT 1:43 Magilla Gorilla 1:43 Jabber Jaws 1:43 Yogi and Boo Boo 1:43 Bam Bam and Flintstones 1:43 ...the Yetis from Small foot, really? 1:43 Captain Caveman 1:43 Cheetarah from Thunder Cats 1:46 Agent Smith 1:46 Mr Freeze from Batman Forever 1:46 Flying Monkey  1:46 Pennywise 1:46 Hip Hippos from animaniacs in Blimp (edit: Actually Peter Potamus) 1:46 Frankenstein Jr 1:47 Space Ghost 1:48 GatchaMan (bottom right) 1:48 Rosey from Jetsons 1:49 Penelope Pitstip and her car 1:53 Herculoids 1:53 Robin from Batman 66 1:53 Catwoman from Batman returns and Batman 66 1:53 Jack Nicholson Joker 2:07 Penguins from 1966 and Batman Returns 2:07 the Mask 2:10 The Great Gazoo  2:23 Ice King GoT 2:23 Blue Falcon and Dyno Mutt 2:23 Guy from Mad Max 2:23 Thundercats 2:23 ...The guys from Clockwork Orange, (which makes me question why they couldn't let Pepe Le Pew in)
Who else thinks LeBron James is more than qualified to be in a Space Jam movie like Michael Jordan? I liked the D Wayde pose Lola Bunny did in the trailer. I also think that her design in the first movie was better in the curvaceous department.
Weird...
Gee this looks bad. Should have stop after the 1st one.
Tiene buena pinta no puedo esperar a verrrrrrrr!
Yoo what happened to Lola??!!😂😭
I can’t wait for this
Alternate title, Space Jam: Ready Player One
😆
I think this story sucks and they don’t follow what the original does
Don Cheadle
Billy West was better as Bugs in the original.
Why cartoon bunny have no mommy milkets
This is gonna be bad
Saldra godzilla?
I’m pro
nothing will beat the original
What the hell is this
😂😂😂 this looks terrible😂😂 still it’s gonna be a hell of an entertaining trainwreck
Wow
Look like a great movie but I feel like Kobe Bryant will be way better what you guys think
LeBron: injured for the rest of the season   Warner Bros: we pick you to be in the movie
Space Jam meets Ready Player One
How enjoy movie when no big booba???
This is gonna be epic.
Animation- 10/10 Acting-          9/10 Nostalgia-   10/10 Creativity-     0/10
This brought a tear to my eye Just so many good memories watching Space Jam when it came out and no matter how time passes I'm glad to see it make its way back.
? Where they masks @ ?
Nope won't see it !
please comeback zack snyder in DCEU
american cringe.
Looks lame af!
The 3D bit isn’t really cutting it for me bruh
BRING BACK PEPE  *OR WE RIOT*
Trash
Look what they did to Lola bunny 😢
But I’ve already seen PLAYER ONE !
Always wanted to see War Machine 1v1 lebron 🙂👍
Rotten tomatoes 17% is my guess
Lebron can’t even act as good as Jordan
Dang bronny lookin different
This looks like dogshit ngl
Really hope there’s a “guest appearance” and possibly a nod “tribute” this was my jammmm on vhs. Is the website still up?
Durant and irving should have been monstar
It about time we have a sequel to space jam. It been 27 years.  It like a birthday present for me since I just turn 27😂
Never be as good as the original
This is Ready Player Two
Nooooooooooo123456789010♧
This looks like shit
Haters keep crying.... 😂 😂 😂
Jajajajj
Ok boys that was for me 2:10
😍
what is this black tron
Anything with China James in it must be filled with Propaganda to brainwash our kids. Don't watch this nonsense, please.
1:11 what's up‚ Doc?
Trash
I liked it more when the Tunes just dug their way to the real world.
If MJ doesn't make a cameo I'm going to be disappointed.
Hes a better actor than jordan for sure
Hopefully lebron acting is better now than his last roles
THE REJECTS LOL
This is awesome this is gonna be an awesome movie
It's amazing they cancel a cartoon character but we have a list of people who visited Epsteins Island that are still running around free.
Aside from the very obvious Ready Player One motif they got going on, this looks gloriously stupid.  sign me the fuck up!
China boy
❤️❤️❤️
Ugh😒
Me thinking curry and KD were gonna be in this movie was a big mistake...
Oh god what have they done to Lola Bunny...
garbage just watch the original  Space Jam with Michael Jordan & Bill Murray
Space Jam 1 had better animation.
I hope this movie will be a classic
That's why lebron flop so good. He a good ass actor lol
The first one was magical,  this is crap
It's gonna be ass....lol
*Plot: So someone just left a door open that leads to another dimension.*
Did bronny wrong
Lola Bunny is voice by Emmy Award-winning actress Zendaya from Euphoria as Rue Bennett. she is the youngest winner of an Emmy in the category Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. Just the previous year Jodie Comer had broken Lindsay Wagner's record from 1977.
#RestoreSnyderVerse
King James 😂😂 come on now , he is not a king besides that looks pretty cool for a new version space jam !
I just hope the Monstars will make appearances. 💜💚💙🧡❤
I absolutely love the trailer tbh it kinda looks like Ralph breaks the internet style and the 2d and 3d is looks absolutely perfect my opinion definitely looking forward to see it
Ready Basketball Player One
So read "ready player one" and the movie was 🗑.  I wonder how much to clear all the characters.
I get that they where trying to modernise it by having it set in cyberspace or whatever but it feels like lazy writing, not that having the portal to the toons being in a golf hole was Shakespeare level but it was more creative than "uhhh, internet?". Also considering they are going a bit too hard on the nostalgia characters in this trailer makes me think more now that this isn't gonna be that good of a film or even comparable to the original, but i'm open to being proved wrong.
I have a good and BAD feeling about this
This looks like it might be stupid...
No wonder why Kong lost
Alright, I need to go watch the original now.
Where are all the J's.
Day 1 of not going to the toilet until he pins me
Stop the cap
So are Hanna Barbera characters owned by Warner Bros?
1:18 in your dreams Legone in your  dreams, this proves he's Garbage
I feel like the whole AI thing had potential but they botched it by adding all these random characters. I guess we’ll see, but for now I’m keeping my expectations low.
Garbage!
i can't wait to see the edits on this! ytp i mean
lebrin james LEBRON JAMES
No just no
ho look ! another 150 millions $ flop for Warner ......
乐正子，复姓乐正，名克，是孟子的学生，那时他已是鲁国的大夫。鲁平公有一次与齐王会面修好，在商谈国际问题时，乐正子趁机极力推崇孟子。当时随行的其他大臣，也都说孟子如何如何好，所以孟子这次回到鲁国，鲁平公想要去看看孟子。现在乐正子得到消息，鲁平公取消了看孟子的主意，就去问鲁平公，你为什么不去看孟子。鲁平公因宠信臧仓，当然就多少对他有所回护，答复乐正子时，就只说，有人告诉我，孟子办他自己父母的丧事，都有厚薄之不同，像这样的人，道德修养不够，所以我不去看他了。  乐正子说，这话从哪里说起呢？大概听人说，他对母亲的丧礼超过以前他对父亲的丧礼吧！这是因为他前一次是以士礼丧祭，行的是鱼、豚、鸡的三鼎祭礼。而后来他母亲死了，当时他有了大夫的身份，行的是羊、豚、鸡、鱼、肤的五鼎祭礼。（在抗战以前，大陆上行祭礼，还有三牲祭和五牲祭的分别。三牲是家禽（鸡）、鲜鳞（鱼）、豚肥（猪肉）。五牲是上面的三牲加上家雁（鸭）和肤（兔）为五牲祭。）这并不是他对父母的祭礼有厚薄轻重的不同，而是他的环境、身份、地位不一样了，他还是在依礼行事啊！  鲁平公这时候才明白，但是已经转不过弯来，于是说，不是的，我并不是指这一方面，我是说他所买的棺木、寿衣的质料不一样。给他父亲的是便宜料子，而用在他母亲身上的，都是价钱高的好棺木、好衣料、好被服。乐正子说，至于这一点，也不能说是在礼制上有所违越呀！丧祭用品的价格高低，是因为孟子的经济环境不同。他以前作士的时候，收入少，买不起价钱高的。后来当了大夫，薪水高，就可以花高价钱，买更美的棺停衣衾了。这是孟子前后贫富情况不同，关于礼制方面，则没有不对的地方。  这一段文章，看起来好像平淡无奇，可是几千年来，社会上人情世态，都是这个样子，就是现代欧美各国也一样。中国的古谚，所谓“爱听小语”，以及“远重衣冠近重人”，一般人们，都是用这些小事来评论、衡量一个人的高低、善恶、是非的，甚至成为了道德人格的法码。——《孟子旁通》
This story line. WTF??? Cheesy as fuck.
Daem ❤️😍
If this movie doesn’t say “In memory of Kobe Bryant” at the end, I’m giving it a bad review.
1:42. I’m so glad that iron giant is getting some love in these past years but DROGON!   When was Warner bros part of “game of thrones”?  And I also like how this is a “ready player 1” like thing but the “Warner bros universe”
Imagine LeBron crying for fouls and flopping the whole movie. 😂😂
Outter space vs digital space mj vs lebron
Why won’t you talk about China?
Ngl, this shit slaps.
Looks terrible
lolaaaaa
WHO ELSE READS COMMENTS DURING ADS
I can’t wait to check this out! Space Jam was my first favorite movie as a kid!!
What? Why?
Many things wrong with this movie.
#restorethesynderverse
Ready Player 2 ?
I got goosebumps!
https://youtu.be/gLKMctFQizQ
I love how he gets dumped into a cartoon and instinctively knows to blow on his thumb to get his legs out
Still living in Jordan shadow he’s going to play baseball next.
Mj then LEBRON
To become a Legacy you need to make your own path NOT walk down one that's already been made famous...✌😎
The NBA refs called about 10 techs during that preview.
James will never be Jordan
Imma keep it 100 this looks terrible
RIP Lola’s body
Million dollar idea: have the referee be The Mask.
Please please oh please, have the Aqua Teens make a cameo! I’m begging!!!
1:46 That blonde lady looks like Bette Davis’s character from “Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?” If that is, I’m impressed and pleased
Why they tryin to be ready player one????
Not for me. I'll stick to the original, but hopefully newer generations like it I liked the first one.
I kinda hope the Goons squad get a last minute redemption like the Monstars
Man it will never beat the original.
Looks like a tower of glossy dog doo.
Where kyrie
this shouldve been kobe!!!! sadge
Love how Zendaya stans can recognize her voice from a single second
Before the trailer: A sequel to the Loony Tunes basketball movie? Cool!  After the trailer:.....is this a spinoff of Ready Player One?! Wtf is happening?!
MJ > LJ
Iron giant❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I will watch this mostly to see who is in the background.... I think I saw Cheetara from the Thundercats!
https://youtube.com/channel/UCxqnFMWWGjdN7wL_Xl61mYg
Imagine how bronny gonna feel seeing another nigga call lebron dad.
This is like Space Jam meets Ready Player One
this looks kinda not good
This is garbage..
Scooby Dooby Doo I saw him at 2:23
If Lebron isn’t drinking a sprite cranberry in this, I ain’t watching
WE WUZ ALIENS N SHEEEEEIT
Watch it be a disappointing movie , wouldn't be surprised
OK YALL LIKE THIS IF THE BEGINNING AND HIM BEING a CARTOON IS NOTHING LIKE  THE FIRST ONE LIKE WUT IS GOING ON   Am I just dumb😐
BRING BACK SEXY LOLA!!
Plot twist this is the trailer for the 2nd ready player one
It’s been so long the only version of space jam I remember is siivagunner’s sonic mania radio edit one
Cgi mess all black actors   Old oje was better
huh, you would think they would find out if Lebron James can act before having him start in a Hollywood film, cringe.
Pepe le pew should've been in it 😑
If the og sucks, I can’t even imagine how shitty this is gonna be
Jordan gonna take this personal
the digital de-aging they put on Michael Jordan kinda makes him look like LeBron James
Hype!
Superman better have a cameo in this
how do these movie executives get paid to come up with this shite.....win the game with cartoon characters in order to save your son........no wonder nobody is interested in Hollywood anymore .......talentless executives producing shit films ....ps didn’t Michael Jordan have the same film out years ago. ?
Ready player lebron
Can't believe they even got Steve Kerr at the end of the trailer D:
Is republicans allowed to watch Le’Bron   Don’t care we not watching this bad acting pos
https://youtu.be/W_ppZFW-i3g
I wonder how bad this’ll be
Should have had to play up against a 1991 Michael Jordan as a challenge and asked if there was another way lolol
*MJ CAMEO MJ CAMEO MJ CAMEO*
i don't care if this is the official warner bros channel i refuse to believe this is real
OMG this is so trash.  Lol
At 1:19,  the animation team made an error. Lebron writes with his left hand even though he shoots right handed.
I don't liked the Yosemite Sam 3D model
Let's go we got don cheadle! They still completely butchered lola's design though.
eyo wtf
PLEASE LET CHARLES BARKLEY AND  SHAQUILLE O'NEAL CAMEO IN THIS MOVIE!!!
Looks ridiculous, no thanks, stop trying to be MJ. You’ll never be...
If LeBron Jamss doesn't switch teams,then this movie isn't true to real life.
#NotMySpaceJam
This trailer is too much confused except the Lola's Dwyane Dade Pose! Is Fred Flintstones there to bet on the match??
The movie we’ve all been waiting for
Brooo
Warner Bros came when we needed it the most
MJ done it better
I saw Michael Burnham and checked out.
I'm glad LBJ got this part. Cause if he didn't he would have blamed the white man and made sure the world knew how poorly he'd been treated. No thanks
https://youtu.be/dgC1Tki-VnM
Dammit,Yosemite Sam! Daffy Duck didn't mean shoot the ball literally!
https://youtu.be/0wp5BOOdK_s

Adios pepe le pew hola a la pandilla de los drugos
https://youtu.be/mWFtOmQ9dKA
This movie will be great!!
i wish i saw the original space jam..
King
Wow this looks bad
New wave of furries incoming 😭
What did hey do to Lola's sexual features...
Furries going crazy over lola bunny
They dont even have pepe le pew for christ sakes.
I Love
Man I loved the 90's one this one is weird do you see it 90's never died
This maybe the final nail in the creativity coffin of Hollywood
Spacejam in 1996 was my childhood, great memories that I miss 😢
I CAN'T WAIT BRO YO
Daaaaammmmmmm son
Michael Jordan is definitely gonna be taking this personally.
Is it me or does the 2d Lola bunny look way different than the one they were promoting 🤔
i only came to see big chungus
Wow. That is very similar to my Pokémon version of the squeal. But with evil goons as King Darkrai’s basketball players.
Wow, WB doesn't add pepe Le pew cuz of cancel culture saying he "promotes rape" but they can add the gang from a clockwork orange to the crowd @2:22 ?! Literal murderers  and rapists....fuck outta here, smh
What
This looks awful
I'll wait for the Zack znyder cut🔥
TUNE squad !? What a joke.
2:27 is that supposed to be Dame Lillard ? 🤣🤣🤣
Sucks they went woke!
OMG search this code on google *GC2021YT* if you want to get free gift cards. thank me later ♥
Heavy shit googel this word *GC2021YT* 😲, really cool that they do that
The mini worlds remind me of the map in Kingdom Heards. Btw #FixLolaBunny. One more thing, this gives me Ready Player One vibes since they’re showing A LOT of other animation... give me my anime characters pls lol :P
Warner Bros is killing it this year with the Movies 🔥
Everyone who has just 5 minutes of time to google this word *GC2021YT*, especially for the channel here 👍👍👍
Comments are correct, google this *GC2021YT*, omg how is this possible 🔴
If you missed this you will be sorry, you have to google this word *GC2021YT* this is just awesome.
Space Jam: A New Legacy. In Theaters And On HBO Max July 16, 2021.
Another way to give M. J.a Slap in the Face Again!!! The guys not Arrogant n Egotistical Enough Already!!!  Not M. J. !!!   B James that's All!! Your Not M. J. Goat!!
LMAOOO I see them tryna do the Dwayne Wade and LeBron Dunk
No.
Sorry but this is trash 😔 they tried way too hard to make it ~modern and down with the kids~
I'm gonna guess while they have like 5 min. Left of the 2nd half, their MVP hurts themself and when all hope is lost, the basketball rolls across the court to MJ where he places his right foot on the ball and the camera pans up showing who it is. And the toons are like "Michael's back!"
Looks dumb
Dang that CGI on LeBron hair crisp
This is just Warner Brothers flexing on Disney and I'm 100% OK with that.
I’m not mad at it but why is Westeros and drogon in there? Is it just because it’s streaming on HBO? Lol
1st viewing - What the fuck is this, looks like shit, everything's terrible fuck this! 2nd - it still looks like shit but that 2D Looney Tunes part looks descent enough 3rd - Yeah I think that 2D part will be pretty fun, got some good visual gags, but everything else looks terrible 4th - Okay it's stupid that a bunch of other Warner Bros properties are included but maybe just maybe it could be fun 5th - Okay I think the movie might be fun, it's stupid and doesn't feel like a sequel at all but it might be so trash it's actually fun 6th - This decision makes more sense to me, it's still Ready Player One again but it makes a little sense I guess 7th - I'm way past the point of being mad, I know I'm gonna have fun because of how terrible this will be 8th - This might be good 9th - This will be so bad it's good 10th - Holy Shit, it all makes sense now  This movie might be bad or good, who knows. If it's good then I get an entertaining sequel to one of my favourite childhood movies. If it's bad then I get to laugh at a stupid High Budget Dumpster Fire. I honestly win ether way.
https://youtu.be/MY_595B65Yg
it is a warner bros celebration.
Wow but I like  jorden better than James
They ruined it by putting LeBron. Smh
*I still can't tell if this is going to be awesome or horrible...* I hope it's as good as the original.
Where's my obligatory Wayne Knight cameo?
Wanna be Mike - No Can Do, toooo arrogant
WB: "let's remake something , because idiots will pay to watch anything we give it to them, muahahahah".
Bronny was probably supposed to be the one casting in the film but then after the video LeBron said no
I was kinda meh on this trailer up until "Senior Discount". That was a good one. I'm cautiously optimistic.
OH YEAH!!! Man I still remember back when the first Space Jam came back out In 1996 With Micheal Jordan. So looking forward to this.
The first one and the soundtracks made it legendary, this one idk yet
cringe income
This is so dumb
Why at 0:32 does it sound like love sosa
Alright guys I created Space Jam 3 onew birth it's all about Luca his Epic Adventures as a basketball player suddenly goes in vain when he retires but if he falls into a hole into a world called the trampoline net and Clyde or robots dancing down to the rejects AKA Batoon world he admitted with Bugs Bunny on your giant Marvin the Martian Fred from Scooby-Doo the Animaniacs and others and then he is taken to a huge Arena fired by millions of real life and cartoon people they must take on the monstars in a new way
Why Get Rid of Pepe' Le Pew but keep Rapists from A Clockwork Orange and Pennywise who literally eats children??
But does it have a fire🔥 soundtrack like the original movie though? 🤔
LEBRON JAMS!!!!
im not a fan of the new one...
I recognized some of the monster squad as Anthony Davis “the brow” use to be on the pelicans, klay Thompson “splash bro” from warriors, and maybe russel Westbrook from thunder city. The WNBA ones idk 🤷‍♀️
We need sexy Lola back she can still be strong tho
Ready player one with some basket ball sprinkled over it
Is this in the ready player one universe? No joke
Why isn’t bronny playing his son
As cool as this is, JESUS CHRIST IS STILL LORD!
Space James.
MJ fans would really go this far to kidnap  someone just to prove that LeBron isn't the goat
why was it called "tune world" and not "toon world"? 0:55
They really got off brand bronny and bryce out here
Lola Bunny ain't thicc no more
RL Grime 🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Just had to ruin a classic movie.
Also Zendaya as Lola Bunny?! Shut up and take my money!
Does anyone know when the red band trailer comes out 😆
Mj better cameo. Please.
No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! What is this garbage?  More like Space Jam: A Legacy Ruined.
Best animations I have ever seen.
Not interested!
The Will Smith line was pretty funny
Can't wait to see this!
Not sure how I feel about this
Trashhhhh
i miss the monstars 🥺🥺
Hope MJ does a cameo to helo LB or something bruh
I don’t know 🤷‍♂️ I feel like there was just to much going on in this.
Ready Player 1 but Rated eC
Wow so brony  didn’t wanna play himself 🤔
2:14 This
14k dislikes probably republicans
lebron doesn't feel like hes fit for this movie
Not gonna lie, I’m gonna watch this one, but I hope it’s pales in comparison to the 1st one so that everyone else who hasn’t seen the 1st one can go back and watch it 🤌
Looks like 100% trash
This actually looks pretty good
Ready Player One: March Madness
Lebron instead of Mj smh not even gonna watch it
Lebron = best player ever + continues Space Jam legacy and becomes global ICON. GOAT
Looks TERRIBLE
Better release it before looney tunes get cancelled
I kind of want to support this just because they acknowledged the iron giant 😂
Song: RL Grime — Scylla
#WarnerBros #ReviveTheSnyderverse
Lol. Get it through your heads!!! Lebum will never be like MJ23👑!! NEVER!!
Let's Go
I hereby exercise my right to dislike this video
#restorethesnyderverse
Lol!loved the way granny went OLD SCHOOL!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Oh god no,
could someone please tell me what the basketball games' audience has in common?
Ready Player One: Basketball version
I think they should have got Kobe Bryant for the role.
I've noticed the main group of people that are hating on this movie either A. hate lebron B.  love Jordan C. Have blind love and nostalgia for the original D. They just despise sequels in general, and lastly E. Boomers
At 0:05 you can Dot Warner from the Animaniacs and at 1:43 , you can see the 3 Warner animaniac siblings right behind the flint stone family while driving there flintstone car.
The GOAT Alex Caruso lowkey on being Elmer Fudd.
How u gonna white wash a person in the same movie they play in. Why his skin so light😭
wow another CGI monster
Boooooooooo, there is only one space Jam
that green screen was worse then me in bed
To bad this wasn't about kobe bryant rip he would of been legendary in this film
Space jam 2 comes out on my daughters birthday 🥳 July 16TH
Space Jam but it’s Tom Brady would’ve been way better
This finna be lit!
i never thought i would say this but im not very excited about space jam 2
*Ready Player One but with Basketball*
This is just what we needed! To bring us some joy and normalcy back into our lives during this crazy time! King James, thanks Pal !!!!
No pepe no good
Wow like animal cartoons like this can’t wait for it to drop July 16th yaaaaaay ❤️❤️😘😘
Trash bag the first 1 was better
Anybody else see the iron giant 😭🤣
Bronny punching the air rn
Who the hell would dislike this masterpiece
They done did Lola dirty
Skip gonna say lebron got carried by Bugs Bunny in the championship game
As much as I loved the original Space Jam, this is just another example of how out of ideas Hollywood is
Why do I feel so uncomfortable watching this
So, you take out Pepe Le Pew but it is okay to put characters from the Clockwork Orange? Damn Warner you hypocrite
I love that this exists.
1:24 | No doubt that was Jeff Bergman's voice as Daffy.
wow this looks bad. I never wanna hear someone say Jordan cant act again. Lebron voice is straight cring the entire trailer. Plus the villian in this is alot worst than the original.
Jordan is still the GOAT. Lebron doesn’t get Jordan love
Why though?
Bronny going through it all right now...
El
Anybody know what shoes lebron is wearing on the court and Don Cheadle also
Well Another Spam Jam pretty damn cool
I believe I can fly
Ugh. Lebron can’t be original ? Has to ride GOAT Jordan’s coattail
he should’ve jus used his actual son
Amazing. No need to make new content when you can just recycle the same BS for a new generation every 20 years
This is Warner Bros.'s version of "EVERYONE IS HERE!"
This may have ruined my childhood.
This is just Warner bros flexing all the stuff they own isn’t it
zzzzzzz
Lol definitely not touching Michael Jordan Space Jam
I’m surprised Lechina didn’t put BLM all over this. Kneel before your Beijing masters Lechina
Can’t wait Bron 🔥 🔥💯... but why our homeboys Bronny and Bryce looking different 🥲🤨
Insanely sad
The original will always be better but this will be good I can just tell
Hopefully bugs bunny or one of the characters say like “oh something mike did” like something that reminds us that the characters still think or at least remember mj
Yessir Number 1 on trending
Pennywise and Joker better See eachother  in this film otherwise it will be a failure
I got three words for Al-G Rhythm and his Goon Squad and in the immortal words of Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson: JUST BRING IT!
Where chungus
King James🔥💯
literally the same animations and assets as ready player one
2:27 kickball violation on Granny
Looks pretty good.
Hey  the v i r u s  might have started a lot closer to home ya know. If you google  G r e e n s p r i n g  retirement community in  F a i r f a x  county, V irginia you'll see.  I'm being censored by youtube. This shows you how free America is. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0vZMvMqvHg
Will Big Chungus appear in Space Jam 2?
finna be lit
I mean I like it but idk how ima feel when watching Lebrons trash acting
This is one of the many reasons why lebron will never the goat
RIP Lola Bunny 🐰 🍑
China is going to love this movie
The cgi on Bron’s hairline is amazing.
Im sorry but I don’t think I like it.
This is so stupid..
this looks lit
Look how they massacred my girl Lola bunny
I didn't know that a Space Jam 2 trailer would be so visually impressive.
Amazing 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Boy, I remember the original Space Jam. It was one of my favourite movies. I loved MJ along with cartoons. Now 22, I am so excited for this movie. And how cool would it be that MJ makes an appearance in this? This will so going to bring back memories.
Could you do the soundtrack for the trailer pls
Cant wait!!!
In the back in some clips you can see pennywise(2017),joker (1989),and the mask   Pennywise: 1:46 on the right side Joker: 1:53 on the right side  The Mask: 2:18 on the right side
Lebron is Da man BUT Jordan is GOAT
Lebron couldn't hold Jordan's jockstrap for him.
Shameful.....
still upset about lola bunny
My fellow millenials ! Assemble 😄
Kobee:'(
Ass... straight shitty ass !!!  KOBE-24.8 🐐
SPOILER ALERT!!!  I work for Disney and just got to see an early copy of SPACE JAM 2, here’s the plot. LeBron must help the Toon Squad defeat the evil alien clones of DWade, Ray Allen, Kyrie, and AD in the NBA FINALS. But instead of helping Bugs Bunny and his friends, LeBETRAYAL joins the evil aliens so he can win another cakewalk ring, just like his MICKEY MOUSE RING. LeCHOKE gets clamped by Bugs Bunny and shoots 7/21 from the field and the game goes down to the wire. LeCLUTCH attempts the game winner and LeBRICKS the shot. Luckily, RAY ALLEN’s evil alien clone gets the ball back and seals the game. LeFRAUD celebrates another FAKE RING that he was LeCARRIED to. THE END.
#RestoreThepepelepewCut
lel, SJW shitfest.  Pepe le Pew is a fucking legend.
It'll be a garbage movie that's 95% CGI that will have shoddy, two-bit acting but will be praised as a masterpiece because of nostalgia goggles and lame callbacks and references to other movies.
Literally looks like Ready Player One sequel and no where near space jam 2. Shit looks fucking garbage
Why lebron james, where is the god himself michael jordan. Best basketball player that had ever lived, and lebron says he better than him. Hell nah bro.
Bruhh what happened to lola
Looking for that MJ cameo #90skid
The only reason this movie is going to be bad is because Lebron is in it
This isn't Space Jam, Why not just call it Cyber Jam or Net Jam or something else computer/internet related. It's obviously a tron/matrix sports movie, not a sci-fi aliens thing. I have no problem with this being a full sequel, just that it seems to have nothing to do with space or aliens. Do like a lot of b movies used to, and a lot of AAA movies now do, just name the sequel something new but a twisted or modified version of the first.
Like Coming 2 America This was not needed.
this actually looks good, dont screw this up please
Give it up Lebron you'll never be Michael Jordan. Never liked this man he needs to stick to dribbling a basketball and shut the fuck up.
NOPE! Kinda too blаск for my soul... Let this Creature do the _RАcIаL P0liTic_. This would be failure, i'm telling you WB.
Not impressed.  I am still a huge fan of the original space jam.  Going to have to revisit the trailer for the original  Edit:Spelling
Yessir❤️😁
Plagiarism 3000
I hope Space Jam 2 will be a great film
Take my damn money. I've been waiting for another space jam movie for only god knows how long.
I wish all of you guys luck. We will make it and we will come back stronger than before. We will hug again without fear. Love from Italy. Naples.
I bet LeBron James acted on a soundstage surrounded by green screen for 90% of this movie.
Disgusting
That sucks
So cringe. Would rather get my fingernails ripped out with pliers than watch these movies
More trash 😷
Don’t make him cartoon keep him realistic and keep the cartoons as cartoons
This is already better than Ready Player One.
Granny doesn't need that walker.
Coby and Michel would be great
Whoa 😮 💙💙💙🐐🐐🐐 can’t wait. Best 🎂🎁
2:23 They got rid of Pepe Le Pew, but brought in the Clockwork Orange guys.
I’m just waiting on the “Movie Themed” Sneakers to drop 👟
Am I the only one who can’t stop watching this trailer and is super excited for this movie? 🔥😮
Lookin' as fresh as the original space jam! They ain't gotta do my girl Lola like that tho.
im getting fortnite vibes from this trailer
Come on and slam!
Hi
Oh damn this looks so cool
We all live in a matrix and this Trailer just confirmed it
Luka for the next
🐐👑
This only furthered the belief that that play was an oop lol
Everybody be gangsta till granny starts shooting hoops
There is only one Lola and its not this imposter. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7PJQa1RfM0 #notmylolabunny
Innit this looks like a vodaphone advert
do you want Blockbuster? Get... 😶♥️🇧🇷
This movie is going to suck ass
The other team looks like stands... especially the gold one. Just me?
*SIGH THE FEELS...
Zero soul, this movie looks like trash.
I don't see Penelope Pussycat in it. I thought she was supposed to be in it, too!
This looks so terrible
So they canceled pepe le pew from this movie but they got the cast of that movie that were in a rape scene the guys in white with the black hats and that’s ok
Lebron has too low of an IQ to act.
The animation looks phenomenal. I'm looking forward to this!
All we need left is another ring outta bron this year and I think we can solidify the Jordan debate
It's funny how they have guns on here an cartoon banneds them
I’m surprised it don’t look bad still not a fan of lebron wish they made space jam 2 with Kobe  But this don’t look bad idk if I’ll spend money on it but good job  But why is game of thrones dragon and King Kong and some other in this ??? They not toons !?
You know? Maybe.. Yeah? Like, this kinda looks fun.
Small chungus 😳
This looks incredibly stupid, trying way to hard anymore, we get it LeBron wants to be better than Jordan but he won't. Just have a different movie and stop fucking up classics.
Nah.
Great!
Wonder if LeBron got permission from China to make this remake.
I liked it
This is gonna be nostalgia heaven
I don't know about Tweety's voice tho....🤔
Seriously?? What a waste of money
Ready player jam
Idk how I feel about realistic Bugs bunny
LeBron looks like a pretty good actor atleast in this trailer
Okay, this exists.  Hope it works.
the bron jame
Michael Jordan cameo guaranteed
Wth, looks like the entire plot is in here. That usually is a bad sign.
Big Chungus not long ago became canon in Looney Tunes, and they are making this so that only means one thing
I hate the looney tunes characters in this it’s so gay
Disney: Send word to overlord Mickey Mouse immediately and tell him, Welcome to the space jam
they fixed her
It should have been Kobe :(
Milking that iron giant 3d model for all it's worth I see
Aye wtf
Wait so this is happening in the Oasis?
N-Jam: A New Jungle
where buggie chungy
Just when you thought Labron James couldn’t get any worse of an arrogant douche.
Not gonna lie this looks like some heat
This should be fun!
No thank you
Really!!!
gotta love looney tunes, also might be fun for the cameos.
They literally making a Warner Bros. crossover movie
Ayo bronny in the movie too 👀
They messed with Lola And I don't like it.
This lacks the heart and soul the original had.
I hope the vine kid introduces lebron James
so that's where drogo went.
"Ready Player 1" but its basketball:
#justiceforlola
Let me guess the protagonist marriage is failing and if he wins this game everything will be alright ??
What was wrong with the original?
Where is big chungus?
the fact that they purposely made lola bunny less sexy is the most disappointing thing about this film.
Gen z gon ruin this movie some how
Looks better than the other one wit MJ
Is that Kobe Bryant?
here at 6.9 mil
Name one better cartoon/CGI movie than this
So grandma just kick balled. Was hoping for it to be just 2d but at least it will be partial. Pretty ambitious
The accurate base congruently hover because yew problematically boil about a evanescent helium. abaft, lively measure
Really hoping my boys Monstars were coming back
I can't wait  to watch the full movie
Dang this is a whole new movie I like it how they didn’t just recreate space jams one a different take  looks clean
How about no...
DAAAA GOAAAAAAAAAAT
6.9 million views
Why is no one taking about the Game of Thrones logo. What’s up with that?
Bronny would’ve made an appearance but he didn’t pass the drug test 😞
LETS GOOOO
The only thing that would make this better?  MARIO!
The fact this comes out on my birthday😩😩😩
Too long in the human part, and then running away from real animation
Its just not it
I guess I could ignore Lebron China James.  This looks dope
ARE Y'ALL READY FOR THE SPACE JAM! 🎶
Doing everything like mj, but worse
Can't wait for this to fail.
"MJ"  will always be the best of the best. 💯💯💯
This looks bad
Goat
LeBron James flying through the multiverse like Doctor Strange.
Garbage
This finna go craY
Ok let’s see how much social justice warrior shit is going to be in this movie.
It feels more like a ready player one spin-off but then again I am kinda pumped
guys, Pepe Le Pew isn't "cancelled"....he's in the shot at the end. you just can't see him cuz he got stuck behind the pack of Droogs from A Clockwork Orange.
Ready player space jam
At least Lebron hairline was well presented with the CGI
Soulless
https://youtu.be/xiUgHTYtZq4
these NIGGAS GOIN BRAZYY
Setting a $20 bill on fire is a better use of money than paying to see this
Og space jam will always be better
When I was a Child, I loved the first Space Jam, but I’m genuinely looking forward to seeing this newer Space Jam, precisely because of The Iron Giant, as well as the Looney Tunes.
You’re not Charles Barkley. You’re just a wannabe that looks like him. Sorry. Breakout. You shouldn’t even be here. Be gone. Wannabe. Be gone.
So this is the Avengers Endgame of Warner Bros... Cool
6/10
Lola Bunny is no longer hot.
Actually looks good
However the movie turns out, I'm just a sucker when big movie  studios shove as many licensed characters and references as they can into one movie. And somehow this looks like it's taking advantage of that more than Ready Player One, which you could argue had enough references but in my opinion should have been a movie that leaned far more into that stuff and not worried so much about the drama. THIS looks like the kind of fun I wanted to have with RPO.
Waste of money and time. MJ will be forever the best
Huh......
Yo, Ready Player 23 looks dope! I'm definitely down for this
i wish he was a better actor...
This guy tries SO HARD to copy the GOAT Jordan!
craaaaaaaappppp!!!!
I’m really happy the animation is in 2D and not 3D thank you.  Edit: nvm. 🥲
My 90's heart. I'm getting Pixels and 2K Playground vibes here.
More woke bs. Good luck with that.
Scooby Doo! 1:38 babyyy
SPOILER ALERT!!!  I work for Disney and just got to see an early copy of SPACE JAM 2, here’s the plot. LeBron must help the Toon Squad defeat the evil alien clones of DWade, Ray Allen, Kyrie, and AD in the NBA FINALS. But instead of helping Bugs Bunny and his friends, LeBETRAYAL joins the evil aliens so he can win another cakewalk ring, just like his MICKEY MOUSE RING. LeCHOKE gets clamped by Bugs Bunny and shoots 7/21 from the field and the game goes down to the wire. LeCLUTCH attempts the game winner and LeBRICKS the shot. Luckily, RAY ALLEN’s evil alien clone gets the ball back and seals the game. LeFRAUD celebrates another FAKE RING that he was LeCARRIED to. THE END.
*Wanna sprite cranberry?*
This comes out on my birthday pogggggggg
Yooo 1:46 pause the screen I see a little clown in the right corner
This will be so fun to watch!
MJ a better player and a better actor, that's gotta sting...
Michael Jordan has to make a cameo same with Bill Murray
2:24 GoT Night King cameo
Glad to see Kong's cameo also in this after Godzilla vs Kong. :D
Michael Jordan looks kinda weird in this space jam movie
Space jam 2: electric boogaloo
They going too over the top with the effects and additional of too many characters from other fictional universes. From King Kong, to Flintstones, like...really? Do what the recent Tom & Jerry movie did with regards to visuals and animation. They didn't go over the top. Just keep it simple and don't overcomplicate things too much.
No hate against LeBron he's a great basketball player
This looks awesome
90's kid furry here... Feeling the #hype! #TeamLola!
Come one guys. 131K likes. I mean that doesn't even look that great. And "A new legacy"?! I mean, how much these people enjoy smelling their own farts?
Oh, I see. So. It's Ready Player 1
Why is dis gae
1:17  LeBron has been chasing a super team his whole life
Ayo grandma gotta chill with those moves😂😂
Another thing MJ is better at... ACTING.
Cheetara @2:24
Doesn’t look at good as original space jam
Why 13k dislikes? What is happening there?
still manipulating likes/dislikes i see  love that hard locked 10%
The most expensive Party City commercial ever made.
This looks terrible
Yosemite Sam has guns!!! 😳  I can hear the WOKE Reeeeeing from here.
Destroying another great movie. Hey Lebron, does China approve this movie? Don't bite the hand that feeds you. (delete this comment youtube, like you always do)
Wow this looks bad... like, really bad.
This looks so fucking stupid
I hope this movie is good, the trailer is pretty nice. Lola however...
This is like the Super Smash Bros Ultimate of Warner Bros.
Ready Player One 2: A New Space Jam
1:32 they really just stole that trailer cinematic right from Artemis fowl huh (with the ring idea)
Don the don
Bro they messed up lola
So that is why War Machine has only been in one scene in Falcon and Winter Soldier...
Ready Player One 2
I thought the thumbnail was for a fortnight announcement
They've nerfed Lola so hard, can't even look at her
Where's speddy
2:18 The Mask
Pneumonia
Whaaat the fff....  I have several questions.
Went to space jam to ready player one
Worst actor
This is incompatible to the first one. I don’t think this will even touch the original. I don’t know what this shit is but it doesn’t look interesting to me.
Lmao Lebron can’t even lead a toon squad without trying to recruit Superman, King Kong, Gandalf and the iron giant
Let's be positive to the movie, so we don't get in trouble again.
Meh, I'll pass.
I don't know guys. This looks "overcrowded" to me.
This looks like more of a reboot than a sequel. But as a fan, I'll watch it. If Godzilla vs Kong movie has lived up to its expectations then I'll give Space Jam: New Legacy a chance. Whose with me out there?.
6.5 million people arent gonna watch this movie
Hope he finds some of Michael's secret stuff
My inner 10 year old is going insane
Fegjbvnkpobbj
The fact that the Animaniacs are in this blows my mind  Edit: Yakko is running in the background at 1:43, and the water tower is on the right side at 2:07
Ready Player Two: **EXIST**  Me: Shut up book. This is my Ready Player Two now.
CAN HE ACT
This movie is going bomb so hard its going to completely cancel out the success of The Zack Snyder's Justice League and Godzilla vs Kong.
Nice to see Granny doing the Black Widow pose there.
Can’t wait
Yosemite Sam got his guns back?!
Please read the whole message, even if you’ve been saved.  First accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior; confess that He suffered and died for your sins on the cross. Then start repenting of your sins because we all have sinned and transgressed God's laws. God loves us so much that He sacrificed His only begotten Son (John 3:16), Jesus Christ, and if we love Him then we shall keep His Commandments (John 14:15). Those that know God and love Him will keep His Commandments; those that still refuse to keep them while saying they love Him and Know Him, they are liars, and the truth is not in them (1John 2:4-5). Read the received texts like KJV and keep God's 10 Laws which includes Sabbath (resting from Friday Sunset until Saturday Sunset[7th day{Genesis 2:2-3}]). The Bible teaches that thee antichrist is the Papacy: The Bible clearly states what character traits the antichrist has and only the Papacy fits the mark; all the reformers including Martin Luther agree with this because they saw the character traits of the Papal Rome and it fit what the books of Daniel and Revelation were stating and this includes the whore of Babylon being the Vatican, and the whole world is drinking the wine [wine {grape juice}means doctrine in the Bible, but her wine is fermented wine like Sunday worship to cause spiritual confusion] of her fornication putting themselves in Babylon as well. The mark of the beast is Forced Sunday rest [The Papacy says that the mark of its authority is Sunday] & the banning of Sabbath [7th day] Rest. It takes courage to be in the army of Christ. The battle lines are drawn: you either choose God by keeping Sabbath or Satan by keeping Sunday. We will go through persecution and tribulation and Satan isn’t stupid, don’t underestimate Him; he can transform himself into an angel of light (2 Corinthians 11:14): he won’t be coming in like some angel of darkness and his ministers of darkness will portray themselves as ministers of righteousness. Satan is showing all this evil to then come in as the good guy for you to join in unity in error—but you’ll think you’ll be worshipping God. Satan uses a lot of truth and mixes a little bit of error for your destruction. People will think they’re doing God’s work when they persecute God’s Sabbath keeping people (John 16:2). My brothers and sisters in Christ in the Catholic Church, those in Sunday keeping churches and for people that don’t know Jesus but are looking for the way, the life and truth—please come out of Babylon and repent of your sins before it's too late! But don't trust what I say; read and study the Bible to find out. I know what I said sounds harsh, I’m not trying to be, and I mean this with the upmost respect and kindness towards you and all of God’s beautiful creation of mankind—both in the body of Christ and outside the body of Christ. God bless!   Sabbath day was not created for Israel: As God's people they needed to keep His Law's because God chose them. It was created before Israel and it's for all mankind who choose the True Living God, through His only begotten Son Jesus Christ. Us Christians call Jesus King, which He is: A King has laws for His kingdom; 10 Perfect Laws our God created, which includes Sabbath (A day He sanctified, so you can’t say there’s any day of the week to rest with God: The day He set is the seventh day), and are part of His character. So if you choose Sunday rest when it's enforced (Mark of the beast) by the Antichrist (Roman Catholic Papacy—read Daniel 2&7&8 and Revelation 13 for information on the antichrist and the core of Bible Prophecy to understand):you are then breaking our Kings’ Laws. Keeping and resting on Sabbath along with, if you can congregate, always will mean you are choosing God and His authority in your life. Choosing Sunday now, since it hasn't been enforced, means you're knowingly or unknowingly choosing Satan's authority. But many will say, well Paul and the others broke bread on the first day of the week... Yeah you should worship God everyday and break bread with your brothers and sisters in Christ every once in a while, but Sabbath is the day of rest, hallowed and sanctified by God: The Seal to His Laws. The whole Bible says basically if you love God then keep his Commandments. Jesus died on the cross (Grace and Pardon) because we have sinned (transgressed His Law's[1 John 3:4]). So it's all about God's laws and Jesus saving us from our sin (His Sacrifice to pardon us and to save us for the Transgression of Gods’ Laws). Oh and yes, we are free from the Mosaic & Ceremonial laws when He died on the cross, but not God's Laws (Ten Commandments are in Exodus Chapter 20): we still keep them. We are saved by God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ: We keep Gods’ Laws as a consequence of being saved. Love you, God bless.   The book of Daniel in the Old Testament is the key to truly understanding the Book of Revelation; make sure to remember that every day in prophecy equals a year (Ezekiel 4:6 & Numbers 14:34). Book of Revelation is a chiasmus {[Looks like this(\/)](\Historical&Eschatological/)}also; this information will help you to understand the makeup of the way Revelation is written, along with The Book of Daniel. God bless with your search for truth (The word of God, Ten Commandments, and Jesus is the way, the truth and the life) my brothers and sisters in Christ—ask God in prayer what truth is and to ask for the spirit of prophecy, and for help to understand His Word. People that say it’s okay to break Sabbath and to keep Sunday or other days is an enemy of God; however, many have been deceived and God understands, please ask God for spiritual discernment. Don’t trust me, only Trust Jesus Christ, His Word and His Commandments. God bless!  P.S. Please Subscribe to It Is Written on YouTube and watch their life changing videos about Jesus Christ and His Word. Please look up and watch the Total Onslaught Series with Walter Veith and Discover Prophecy with David Asscherick: Two lecture series for those who don’t have any understanding of Biblical Prophecy and those that do have some knowledge of prophecy and the war that’s going on; other great lectures for you to watch are Rekindling the Reformation, Darkness before Dawn, and In the stream of Time—all by Walter Veith, also watch this wonderful series called What’s up Prof with Walter Veith and Martin Smith as they use the Word of God and apply it to modern things going on for the times we live in now. If you really want to learn lots about the Bible and true doctrinal teachings about it and the war going on, these videos and lecture series will be a blessing to you and those you share them with. Also please read these wonderful books called The Great Controversy between Christ and Satan and The Desire of Ages by Ellen G. White.  It’s okay to hate me and I know I repeat myself a lot, that’s how important God wants you to know about keeping His Ten Laws including Sabbath, but please don’t hate the Truth— if it’s Truth, then it’s worth buying. I’m not better or wiser, I’m most pathetic, but because God cares about you and He is wanting seeds of truth to be in your heart for when you see the blatant truth of what really is going on, God shall be your growth and His Word a Lantern unto your feet in the spiritually dark world we live in. Please love your enemies that do great evil towards you, we are no better, we are all sinners. Please share this message if you want to.   Revelation 14:6-12  6 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, 7 Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. 8 And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. 9 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, 10 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: 11 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. 12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.  Solas Scriptura!—The Bible and The Bible alone!  Solas Christus!—Christ and Christ alone!  Solas Fide!—Justified by Faith and faith alone!  Solas Gratia!—By Grace and Grace alone!  Solas Deo Gloria!—Glory to God alone! //////////////////////////
YAS i love this
So.... PIXELS?
The advertisement for hbo max featuring LeBron James
LeBugs Bunny
The serververse worlds looks like the same ones from kingdom hearts
this movie is gonna flop due to woke censorship
Ready player one, space jam dlc
k why does this actually look really good
Let's hope opponent team don't have Steph on their side.
It's awesome
Meh
So it starts out as Tron. Then it becomes Wreck-it Ralph 2. Then it becomes Ready Player One.
Pause at 1:46 and you can see the warner siblings on the blue flying saucer
Didn't expect to say this, looks good
Animation looks cool but its still a no for me, looks like a giant cash grab
There is no such thing as space jam without a cameo from mah boi shaq👎
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥BOUT TIME
mane they did lola bunny dirty
I was excited when I saw the art for this movie but now that idea seem the trailer I'm actually disappointed asf.
Now all they need is big chungus to make an appearance
Ok I'll go on a leap of faith here after seeing Granny being a badass
I'm guessing the execs at WB saw Don Cheadle as Captain Planet and said: "That's our villain right there!!"
Never thought Id see Game of Thrones references in a kid movie 😂🔥
2:23 was that Scooby doo and the gang?
The song is Scylla by RL Grime Mixed with the space jam theme.
w
Where Bill Murray @???
Such a cringedible film judging by a trailer.
idk rick
Wack
Black Window on Disneyplus is gonna flop with terrible $30 a pop in premiere access cost while Space Jam: A New Legacy on HBO Max and select theaters is free and gonna be amazing with the mother of crossover Easter eggs. It's that The Flintstones and Animaniacs? Granny at the end is channeling her inner badass self though. I wonder Cartoon Network superheroes like Ben 10, Steven Universe and Crystal Gems and Powerpuff Girls are gonna punching Don Cheadle's villainous character to pulp, after all Cartoon Network is own by Warner Bros.
This looks like absolute garbage, and not the charming kind of cheesy trash that the original was. LeBron is an obnoxious person (who also can't act), Lola's been given the woke 'attractive female erasure' treatment and now looks like little more than a palette swap of Bugs, Pepe is likewise gone thanks to a false woke narrative, the 2D looked really cheap, and the CG Looney Tune models? I'd call it fan art caliber, but the fans would actually do a better job... and Serververse? Really?  Imagine thinking this actually looks good...
NOW IMAGINE IF KOBE MAKES A CAMEO..
_Westeros_ from A Song of Ice & Fire? Warner Bros. owns Game of Thrones?
Cool
James ruined it
I hope people don’t hate on this just because it’s a remake.
King James🔥
Lebron can't act at alllll...omg
🔥
King James🔥💯
Looks shite
🔥
King James🔥💯
Where's Michael?
Omg soooooo bad
Hahahaha omg soooooo bad....sssooooo soooo bad
Since when did Anthony Davis have wings??????.
🔥👌🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What happened to Lola Bunny ???
warner: "we can't have pepe le pew in space jam because he symbolises rape culture" also warner: *adds the gang of rapists and murderers from a Clockwork Orange in the crowd.*
"King James" my eyes almost rolled out of my head. The ego on this PPC  owned loser
Damn LeBron sucks at acting
He entered astro world
Daffy Duck : "I Have An Michael Jordan." Bugs Bunny : "We Have A King James."
👎
Tron legacy 2: ready player done that
Is gonna be epic
I like that they did 2d for part of it!
mixed feelings. should have stuck with the 2d tunes in 3d space like the first movie did. imo anyway.
Of course they have to make it CGI they have no idea how to make cartoons anymore
R.I.P Pepe le Pew you won't be forgotten.
Since they included Hanna-Barbera and Looney Tunes, hopefully they include Cartoon Network as well. I'd be most excited for Adventure Time, Steven Universe, Regular Show, and the original versions of Teen Titans, Ben 10, and Powerpuff Girls.
You know people should stop making sequels to classic movies space jam the first one is always gonna be number one
That’s cool and all, but where’s Big Chungus Amongus
Looks pretty generic to me. Lacks soul. Gonna pass.
“I can believe I can fly” they should’ve added this track
Ready player one 2 was real all the time.
https://youtu.be/EmRaAgFCyLY
Looney 🏀🗑🎮
#restorepepelepew
Looks interesting but will the plot story make sense?
I don't get the dislikes, this looks very good!
Does anyone have any new ideas in Hollywood or it’s it just recycles, prequels, sequels, and comic books from here on out?
Great how many movies were animations become live action CGI. While live action humans become animated. Cuz I'm starting to see things all over again
You can see pennywise in the background at 1:45
Lebron acting is bad ! Plus it’s to much we need more of a classic film why does it have to be so extra ?
Player Two: Space Jam
thumbs down
I don’t usually watch movies! But I’d watch this shiz!
Nice
Not gonna lie...im ready for this.
I wonder if that’s how lebrons younger son is about basketball
Wow sorry it dosent do it for me MJ is a likable person that is humble character and lebron is not i saw the orginal one in theaters when i was a kid should have left this movie alone pepe le pew isnt even in it but every girl and there mom can do a tiktok on the WAP song like thats not offensive right
I recommend watching this high I was so hyped when I saw Don Cheadle pop up as a hologram
Who else wanted r Kelly on the music
I'm waiting for this
This movie will flop because kids have no idea who the looney tunes are
My childhood in a single video 😍😂
BRON UGLYAh he actually did it bruh
Т
LeBron James
Can’t wait !!
I know for a fact Lebron told the director to hook him up with a CGI Hairline
the movie will most definitely have nice looking graphics and effects but I would almost be willing to bet my left testicle that this will be a straight cheesy corny  bad acting booty licking ass water of a film
This got me thinking of the  Space Jam song "Hit em high" with COolio, LL Cool j, Method man etc
Didnt expect Ready Player One to have a sequel this soon
Okayyyyyy this looks LIT AF!!!!
WHOA. How weird and wonderful. Like how they're using CG models this time around.
I'm calling it: MJ cameo
imagine your son getting kidnapped by A.I. and you're forced to play ready player one to save him
Emoji movie looks better than this
Is sequel?
anything Ryan Coogler touches is GOLD
You gave Sam his guns back. Nice.
Lmao they got Pennywise up in the movie too. 😂
Why there are orange clockworks character in this child movie ?
not the GOAT
I really hope at the end of the film they pull an Engame 'portals' scene with all the WB characters to help LeBron and the Toons but it would be Rick Sanchez and the infinite versions of himself making the portals.
to be fair MJ wasnt a good actor lol
What's up doc 🤣🤣
Cant wait... wow
It's like those old mashups that they used to do like wacky racers or cartoom Olympics or whatever it was called
Only 3 types of movies: Remakes. Sequels/Prequels. Superheroes.
That's a super no.
Ew
It’s not space jam but it doesn’t look bad
This is the ultimate HannaBarbera movie
Would have been better with Kobe.
Lol MJ’s acting > Lebron’s acting
Eh? what's up doc. IT ' S  T I M E  T O  S L A M  N O W ! , Childhood's are rising me back.
LEBRRROONNNNN
I’ll watch this when it comes to VHS
I miss you Pepe Le Pew.
OOOOOOOOOOOHHHHH MYYYYYY GGOOOOOIIIIOOIOOOOOOOOOFDDDDDDDDJDBDHXJDBXB!!!!!!!
It just like the endgame but it's Warner Bros
Is miss Michael Jordan in space jam 😭🏀
Nice, I'll be giving this one a miss
Big chungus gonna be in this
Can’t wait for NBA Jam 2
Corny
😅🤔
Will never ever ever live up to the original.
Fun fact: The Animaniacs can be spotted in this trailer.  At 0:04 You can see a golden statue of Dot behind LeBron  At 1:02 you can see the movie lot from the series in the bottom left corner  At 1:46 You can actually spot who I think is Yakko and Dot on the far right of the screen (Above the blue dinosaur  And at 2:07 You can see the water tower on the far right
Where’s my home boy Speedy Gonzales? A Mexican here wants to see him.
Nostalgia goes only so far. The commercial was pretty lame... Hope the movie is better
Grown ass men bashing a movie meant for kids. It's not like this movie gonna cure cancer or bring world peace
"SIGH".... this is why MJ is the GOAT.
For some odd reason halfway threw the trailer I got ready player one vibes, because it looks like Warner Bros is kinda doing the exact same thing in Space Jam 2 as they did in Ready Player One (Cramming Every Pop Culture Reference as much as possible wether they own it or not)
every time we criticize Bollywood for copying Hollywood but this time its the opposite...….  Did no one notice its a English version of TOONPUR KA SUPERHERO...….
Mazzzzzzzz👁👣👣👣👣👣🦶🏻🦵🏿🦵🏿
Not gonna lie....I’m disappointed
Sorry but no.
Next level animations
This looks to be potentially better than it would normally deserve to be, let's hope they put some smart  "pixar-ish" imagination into the storyline!
Look how they massacred my girl.
Something tells me this one wont have the same feel as the first one.
look at the background crowd...
i dont like how they used the same vocals for a remixed version of the song
Jim Carey...The Mask...the very end...bit blurry
Worried that this is gonna be like Ready Player One where they rely so heavily on the cameos from other films to cover up the fact that the movie itself is shit. The Looney Tunes were able to carry the original Space Jam with no problems so the cameos are a concern.
"Warner Brothers Pepe Le Pew would not be in the new Space Jam". But what about The Clockwork Orange gang and Pennywise ."Warner Brothers these movie character definitely appropriate for children"😒
They even got Sonequa in this.
Where’s Pepe le Pew!
still the old space jam movie looks like a way better movie than this
This trailer tells so much about the plot and story, you can already rate the flick on IMDB.
Just doesn’t feel like the original one
Too bad I won’t pay a dime to see this movie, half of America will not pay to see this woke joke either. That’s why MJ didn’t do political commentary.
I’m sad I liked the original because the looney toon characters were 2d and interacting with the real world. This by the other hand is just normal cgi in the real world and animation in the looney toon world
Looks like a straight to video movie. Why didn't they get Lebron acting lessons??
Meh looks shitty.
Mustard.
This is basically a trailer for HBO Max 😂
My boii Gilbert arenas is in the movie
i was so close to pressing dislike
How many CGI artists did it take to give Bron his 2002 hairline?
Where's Michael Jordan this guy sucks
0:23 Dumb!
Nice, but #RestoreTheSnyderVerse please
imagine kidnapping someone’s son just so you could play one basketball match against them
Can't wait! (I watched the first Space Jam on a Delta plane because it was one of the movie options lol!)
Getting HBO max for the Snyder Cut: broke  Getting HBO max for Space Jam 2 :  w o k e
What would be awesome is if lebron plays against MJ
He can't even catch Bryant
i guess this should be obvious but LeBron is a horrible actor.
I do not approve. Looks like a gong show.
How much money was wasted on this crap?
damn. no wonder why this took so long. cameos, how nice everything looks, it's looking very promising.
to be fair I had a space jam growing up so I get why they remade it
Too bad Michael Jordan couldn’t cameo. RIP. 🙏🏾
I thought I would hate this, But I don't. lol.
2:11, d-wade
Waiting for Wokèmon cancel vultures to start throwing a tantrum over Yosemite Sam Shooting the 🏀! 😂🤣
If they make an extended cut with Pepe Le Pew, and he has 30 minutes extra footage; then I'll be happy. I just want Pepe back😔✊.
They won’t stop till all your childhood favourite are butchered. Jurassic Park, Star Wars, Ghostbusters, Charlie’s Angels, Rambo, The Terminator.  All of them Butchered. Hollywood is disgusting.
I wish he had to actually compete against famous WB villains and characters.
Kobe should of been in the second movie. Lebron in the third because we know he wouldn't show up in the fourth. Leave that one to Kyrie or Anthony Davis. 😂
I had concerns about this reboot but I gotta admit this looks good.
Their universe just got a whole lot bigger, i grew up on the first space jam
The effects are insane
So everything has to be references now.  Ready Player One, Wreck It Ralph 2, and this.   Woo look at all this pop culture! We're sure you'll love our movie because we put things in it you recognize! /s  I hate it already.
Honestly... I have no idea what to think of this. Which to me is a pretty good thing.
0:05 Statue of Dot from Animaniacs
garbage because king shit is in it
This movie is better than the old
Yo Bronny got shorter wth
Is it just me or does this not look good at all?
90 graphics over today's... 90 level of ignorance too...
Warner bros. Pls don’t mess this up.
i dont care what anyone says this looks awesome!!!! love the looney tunes characters look 3d
Mj is better🙄
They're back and I love it.
Okay it's looks ridiculous enough to be fun
9,009 days after the original was aired! This is epic. 😎👍 Looking forward to it!
Don: Send this clown to the rejects..                    T U N E W O R L D Bugs: Meh..(crunch crunch) sup Doc  ****instantly convinced I'll risk covid to watch it***
damn rl grime out here
I hope they put unikitty from the lego movie as the background character(including puppycorn as a cameo)
I saw the Warner Siblings at 1:46!
This looks like a visual spectical.
:(
I think they running out of ideas
This look like it might be better than the first Space Jam. I can't wait to see this movie.
Aaaaand there goes all the excitement i had for this
Thanks for ruining my childhood with this crap.
This just pissed me off
Cant wait for this movie
nope. just as bad direction and horrible untrained nba shit acting as the 1996 version. enjoy shit in your eyes and ears folks. just a money grab.
2:23 NBA 2k21 "dribble gawds" be like
Yikes...
WB you couldn’t live with you’re own Snyders cut failure where did I bring you , back to my wallet.
King Lebron 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Iron giant <3
This actually looks good
Why isn't Kobe Bryant the main character?
1:45 look at the face Kong🗿🔫🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Looks good.
Whatsup doc
I'm certainly looking forward to watching this. Last time it was MJ that was helping the Looney Tunes help save them, and now it's The Looney Tunes helping Lebron rescue his son. The roles are reversed now. We don't need to spend too much time with the Looney Tunes characters b/c their characters have already been developed and are more or less the same. So it'll be fun to see them interact and help Lebron develop whereas oppose to MJ, he was helping them develop into confident players and work efficient as a team.     I hate this notion that something can't be just as good as the original, or if you actually think the movie is better than the original, you're slighting MJ, and favoring Lebron. Space Jam was fun for it's time and now the kids of this generation will have an opportunity to share the same feeling I did when I was young. This movie looks fun. Just like the original.   Have an open mind you guys.
#restorethesnyderverse
Four year old me would come home from preschool, rewind the tape and then watched Space Jam religiously. I’m 24 now and can’t wait to see this. The nostalgia but man the features- I’m so damn excited.
let's goo
stupid asss video
This looks stupid asf...why
It's JAM time!!
This should be in cinemas! It such a waste if this was streaming
Kinda a dark premise. "I wanna play basketball against you so I'm kidnapping your son and not giving him back unless you beat me"  Dafuq?? I understand they were basically doing the same with MJ in the original, but kidnapping a kid?
ش
This will be such a flop..
now I have something to look up too this year, thanx LeBron James!
Wow! Is Yosemite Sam using a gun? A GUN in a child's cartoon?! No no no no no no CANCEL IT CANCEL IT CANCEL IT
yo this looks sick
Wow, that looked BAD
It already looks like the first one is gonna be better than this one just like  Michael jordan how Michael Jordan is the goat over lebron
Lebrons acting is so cringy
JuLy16
I just dont understand why 2d animation has been black listed so fucking hard. I almost cried seeing all the character 2d animated and then 5 seconds later...fuckin nope 🤦‍♂️
Star Trek is so out of touch with it itself that this movie could have been a ST:Discovery episode. Hollywood dung.
Oh no.
Long have I waited...
Who else watched Godzilla vs Kong yesterday in the theater
MJ's space jam still the most genuine & impressive to me. The new one look like a x box game
#restorethesnyderverse.......
Looney Toons play Basketball : The Return
This is going to be corny af lebron is a salty snowflake
He's not live action? A save your son bs scenario?  OK, this movie will officially suck.
I knew it was gon be a Jordan lebron argument lol
Lmao will smith deals with a lot worse TRUST ME
Won’t see me paying money to see this
nope
reminder that the 1997 website is still available and it is still a time capsule for web developers
Trying too hard.
LEBRON WOULD NEVER BEAT MJ 😂🤣😂
D O N  C H E A D L E
Ayo tf
“What is this?” Tron basketball. Original....       NOTTTTTTT
GAYYYYY will never be the OG space jam
Can the dc super hero girls turn into 3D like the tune squad
2:10 Every furry in the world liked that.
It’s coming out on my birthday
Not a good actor man and I don’t never hate on lebron but just no good emotions show
I'm not a big basketball fan, I saw the original and I love the idea of Space Jam. I think they need to make new ones every 10-15 years. Having a current basketball icon in a movie like this is awesome. I wonder who the player they would have had stared if they had a 60s, 70s, and 80s version of this movie
While everyone is talking about Pepe Le Pew being gone I’m surprised no one noticed Barnyard Dawg (Foghorns main enemy) is completely missing and seemingly replaced with Gossamer (the reddish orange monster)
Trying. Too. Hard.
I’m actually so happy this was made I hope it’s good
It actually looks decent.
Gets rid of lePew because he's too "rapey" but puts in the actual rape group from clockwork orange...AMAZING...
If speedy is in the movie, what happened to Pepe le pew?
They should have just left it.
Please please please tell me that LeBron is *NOT* the sole NBA star here.  The original had such a mega cast that a single playa is just f'ed up.
Granny packing that heat 🥵
Cringe on the acting
his real sons should come out at the end and help him win.
Wouldn’t it be dope if Shay and Skip took notes during the movie and talked about it on one of their segments as if it were a real thing.
Restore the snyderverse
After 25 years, I can finally see a sequel! I wanted this for a long time!
Lola's nerf will not be taken kindly ☹
YES! YES! YES!
0:32 shooting star meme sequal : the destination
They downgraded Lola... Damn.
0:02 Kyrie was an uncle, now he's a son?
ZENDAYA AS LOLA FUQ YEAHHHH I'M SO HAPPY FOR HER
mj has better acting skills. 🐐debate is over
Might risk getting corona and go see it in theaters😩
You know with the revival of Animaniacs, they better get featured, even just subtlety, in this movie.
No Pepe Le Pew. What a shame.
HBO Max : *Stream at no extra cost.*  Disney+ : *Additional Fee For Black Widow.*
Lol okok
omega cringe
Men Captain Planet going crazy again? :)
looks like steaming pile of garbage
Flopping everywhere. 🤣🤣🤣
Hollywood is desperate
Ewww
Kwassic... Tweety bird FTW
NO ONE WILL EVER BE BETTER THAN MJ!! The original one will and always be better. Btw why tf are they calling him King James?? Soo dumb 🙄
It’s like Doctor Strange trippy.
Lol this looks stupid. Come up with new ideas lazy hollywooders
They nerfed Lola bunny lmao
this looks mid as fuck
Not a fan of the CG honestly, should've remained classic animation.
this is just pixels but with basketball
Who spotted the mask ?
Grandma got moves🤩🥶🥶🥵
Oh yeah I'm hyped
So space jam but just rip off thor ragnarok and ready player one
It went from the lowest quality, to the highest quality possible
I hope J J Barea and Jason Terry are not from the aliena squad, cause then we are screwed.
Bro, this year really is serving
Marvel: endgame is the biggest crossover ever!  Bugs bunny: hold my carrot
#restorethesnyderverse
I don't see what wrong with Lola bunny
Why is Don Cheadle out here kidnapping kids like he Slenderman
Why does every good movie need a shitty remake. Think of something new for the love of god.
FAKE! We all know LeBron's incredible vision would have allowed him to find his kid @0:17 Nice try, immersion RUINED!
Looking like Ready Player Lebron
Well.. I came here for the comments
We don't want the serververse just #restoresnyderverse that's it
Remember when Michael Jordan turned into a cartoon when entering the looney tunes world?
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Istg Warner Bros put iron giant and Kong into everything
Eu não tenho roupa pra esse evento meu deus ❤️
THIS IS GONNA BE AWESOME CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH IT WOOHOOO
It’s going to be weird without 🦨🦨
6.1 million views 1 day ago
Nothing is sacred.
It would have been nice to see Michael Jordon on Space Jam as well! I look forward to seeing this! The first one was a classic hilarious!
they should've never been making this. og space jam will always be it
Who are those players irl from the Goon Squad people?
Waiting for next Trailer
@1:17 he’ll need that team to defeat Brooklyn this year
Aye comes out on my birthday
Man the original was my childhood it will be hard to top it but I’m interested!
Lebron had gandalf on his list of potential players 🤣 say what you want, but the guy knows how to pick a team
Is nobody gonna talk about the new lola?
I won't know until I see it. Definitely interested though.
1:41 OH MY GOD IT'S DROGON
Looks just as terrible as the original.
#Restore the snyderverse...❤️🙏
I'm happy to see them doing a new story instead of rehashing the original
1:38 even the Scooby gang in this movie. This is gonna be awesome
Ew thay made it 3d
0:35 OH MY GOD GAME OF THRONES
Oh for fuck's sake......compared to this bullshit the original Space Jam looks like The Godfather...
2:24  Pepe le Pew: kicked out due to representing rape culture  The Droogs: shows up as a cameo appearance.
SJ2 is going to make the highest-grossing of 2021.
this looks awful 🤮
Where’s *Big Chungus!?!*
Lebron James is surprisingly super good at acting. Natural actor.
1:25 now that's properly american..
Wasn't he going bald?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Trash
この人かっこいいな。めっちゃイケメンやん
#RestoreSnyderVerse
im confused why they didnt use Lebrons actual son instead, oh well
why didn’t they use Lebrons youngest son instead of the random kid
Oh hey rodey has a new story to tell the avengers now. Maybe thor will think it's cool.
JeBrawn's acting is ass.
Is that is drogon....? What is he doing here???
This is cool but if you want to see a thing as good  as that look at 5# for trendy
This is dope
3d 2d too many variations in animation makes it feel like a commercial
It looks interesting. I gonna watch it.  Even Pennywise and the night king were in the audience of the basketball game XD
Why is it called SPACE tho?
Sees animaniacs
Hoppas den är bättre än den förra
Hopefully this’ll be good.
They are doing to much. This looks like a flop
This movie is going to flop harder than Lebron 😂
pr
Gotta admit—this trailer won me over. Looks fun.
I think Lebron just needs to retire basketball and just be in movies he would have a great adventure.
i saw all speaking live characters black or iits my imagination ? fucki black privilige movie
Anyone else surprised how good this looks ?
Boom.
AAAH 3D BUGGS
leeeeeebooooaatttttt❤️❤️
Make it stop =( this world is so unrecognisable
Is this a sequal? Because they have to find a dream team all over again...
Looks dumb
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Ho f*** i am super happy now
Of course they have to put kong with loony toons 😐
Cringe like the first one
A remake will never be as good
This is rediculous in the best way possible
Shit looks better than I expected
IT'S ALMOST HERE....
This gives me hopes that Charles Barkley shut up and Jam ! Gaiden will release his 2nd part
From The Director Of The Best Man Holiday and Girls Trip and The Producers Of Self Made and Judas and The Black Messiah
We need a cameo of michael jordan
Lebron James
the original is beter
I’m confused. Is this Space Jam or Ready Player One?
6mil in only one day!
This looks terrible. Like bad. Like not good. Just bad.
lebron will always be Jordans shadow
Where’s the big chungus grrrrrr 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
If LeBron James and the Tune Squad wins the basketball game, LeBron, his son, and his family are free from the cyber world. But if Al-G and the Goon Squad wins, LeBron James and his son are trapped in cyber world forever.
This is best hollywood actor i ever seen 😍😍😍
even though the whole movie isn’t 2d animation, they at least have part of the movie in it which makes me happy to see 2d animation on the big screen!!!
👑🥕
LeBron >MJ
Damn, can't believe they were able to get Lebron James for Ready Player Two
https://youtu.be/qsqNV7FiZuM  Hey there! I know we don’t know each other but idk if you’ve seen me posting about this recently or not but this is the YouTube series I’m starting. We’re in the process of filming episode 3 soon. I’m super excited about it! If you haven’t done so already you should subscribe to the YouTube channel and follow the IG page. Thanks 🙏🏼   @bmoreindi
Boa tarde, esse filme é maravilhoso. Adorei o vídeo.
I came here to playa hate but I must admit, this looks really good.  I can't wait.
Actor MJ > Actor Lebron Change my mind
This is going to be so woke 🤮
This has got be some of the lowest budget 2d animation I’ve ever seen, with some of the weakest character design in 3D. That’s enough to put me off.. i can’t be the only one sick of the cop-out 3D animation, especially when they put no effort in the character design.
Space Jam 1 seemed more light hearted. This seems serious in the most non serious way. Lol
Seems worth watching but perfer the original Space Jam
Gay
They should remake loonitics unleashed
This is the part of the hollow earth that Kong returns to
Even Bugs Bunny is better than Andre Drummond
This looks like a fever dream
This movie has 4 writers ...FOUR. And it still looks like trash
I want Tom and Jerry in this movie too 😭😂
Ready player one wannabe trash.
That was the dumbest trailer I’ve ever seen right next to sonic 2
Super smash ultimate is the biggest crossover Warner bros: Hold my Bear
looks bad. doesn't carry the same tone as the original
Lola aint bad no mo
This kinda makes more sense to me then going down a golf hole and finding bugs bunny
Not feeling this...
So the Night King from Game of Thrones is in this...
This was a mistake Lebron..
Looks like trash the original space jam was clearly better.
I love that the iron giant is there, sometimes I wish they would take out the sequel
Lets be real after jordan it should had been kobe for space jam 2
This doesn’t feel like space jam, they really could have copied the storyline of the original space jam and have the goon squad make a comeback and steal curry,Harden,KD,Giannis and Anthony Davis talent, have them get greedy and steal 75% of the talent of the NBA and keep it in a jar and have them go to Michael Jordan and request a rematch, and once he declines because he doesn’t play anymore and since the nba lost all its star players and talent, it will be forced to close down for good, Michael Jordan goes to Lebron and ask for a favor and Lebron steps up and helps out and have Jordan coach for the tune squad.   Seriously something along this line would of been dope. Big fan of the original and I just don’t feel good about space jam 2.
They knew Bronny finna be too high to become an actor
La van a romper :')) espero esté en cineeess
Pass
“Bet will smith ain’t gotta deal with this!”😂😂
Looks like dogshit, lola is still cute
This looks like trash.
1:17 u know ur there all in different universes right ?
DID ANYONE ELSE PEEP THAT ICONIC POSE LOLA DID AT 2:09 😍😂
YAAAAAS PLEASE
wut
Clock work orange. They got rid of pepe le pew but they put the people from clockwork orange In it.
Smh Lola 😭 they did you wrong
Fantastic ❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥
Look at what they did to Lola bunny.
Nice Lebron and D Wade reference
2:06 shoes look 🔥
what happened to lola bunnyy
Welcome back to the jam
.....
man LeBron can't act for shit i love it
This looks kinda dumb, but interesting nonetheless
If the original one was infinity war, this is endgame with all the different shows
and i thought it was going to be kobe. MJ was retired when he did the space jam along with his teammates.
He should have put mob in his dream team, mob psycho is owned by warner japan and as this multiverse warner has everything related to warner bros, warner japan would also be there
Bring back Pep Pe Le Pew
I am going to watch this movie just because of King Kong
The realistic Bugs Bunny is terrifying
#restorethesnyderverse
#restorethesnyderverse
I admit the original was cheesy but had some enjoyable qualities, this one looks much, much worse. I guess it's for kids though, so who am I to judge.
They really trolled the hell out of us by having Lola wink at us
I thot it was going to be good
Its looks ok....definitley doesnt look as good as the original but still looks alright
The hairline is lookin crisp
It's LeBron dad run for me 😂😂😂
When u are only one real Human between the cartoons 🙁
Yeah, this looks awful...  "Don Cheadle kidnaps Lebron's son and holds him hostage. The ransom: Lebron gives Don some of his social media followers- or beats him in a game of basketball."
No thank u.. pepe should be In it
Rejects?
Am I the only one who sees Joaquin Phoenix's Joker in 02:25 in the left corner ?
No. Just no. Jordan didn't look cartoonish in Space Jam. There were no "matrix hell" and "digital overgod" either. No "i gotta rescue my child" plot. That's not Space Jam.
I'm glad I have hbo max.
LeBron James teams up with the Looney Tunes to rescue his son from a server algorithm. *OR* Ready Player One meets Looney Tunes. *OR* Ralph Breaks the Internet, Warner Bros. edition. *OR* Super Warner Bros. Ultimate. *OR* Kingdom Hearts but with Warner Bros. and basketball.
Bro this movie is basically Ready Player Two
Bring back Pepe Le Pew!
Wow this looks stupid
I hated Ready Player One the Movie
1234567890
This movie is just a way for Warner bros to flex their IP's without actually making a movie for them
What war machine/Rhodey doing there
Aww yisss
Damn this trailer showed EVERYTHING
Those jerseys are gonna resell for thousands on stock x
LeBron is 🐏
Have full  MV Mr?
An alternate universe where Rhodes is the JARVIS to Tony Stark.
OMG ITS SASHA HHAHAHAHAHAH NICE
Where’s Michael Jordan?
Cant wait till this movie comes out so hyped  And who else is an OG and remembers the 1st one and who was in it
I remember when I first watched the original Space Jam on VHS in the late 90’s....lol. We couldn’t afford DVD, but now I can just lay across my bed to watch the new Space Jam. I can’t wait!!
Last boss is MJ the goat obviously
How come they didn't motivate all races , this seems like a one guy one color thing
DUDE THIS IS THE CARTOON ENDGAME I BEEN WAITING FOR-
RL GRIME❤️
My childhood memories are coming back.🙉🙉🙉🙉 Amazing 🙈🙈🙈🙈
Qgdujoooooo9999
How did this kid become dom from fast  And the furious 🤦🏽‍♂🤦🏽‍♂🤦🏽‍♂
L E B R O N       J A M E S
1234567890
I had low expectations BEFORE seeing this trailer. Didn’t realize how low they really should have been 🤦 hard pass
No pepé no money.
This movie sucks REAL BIG BROWN BALL😂fuck this movie, where MJ at
Why does the giant robot looks familiar
Tried to do a handstand I did and then I fell I have a video of it on my YouTube channel watch it now
Monstars > goon squad
This make me feel like a little kid again after seeing space jam with MJ!!
Mj was better
Whaaaaaat! What did that granny say "I am going old skool on his"
the prophecy ! it happened at last !
Why  you gotta be so extra with this I like the old space Jam it wasn't as extra and didn't take itself to seriously as this one is
This is great for the culture, im with it!!!!!! Nothing beats the classic but ima still watch it no cap!
Talk about a money grab
Isnt Buggs Bunny and the rest of looney toons considered white supremacist?
Omg omg🌹🤩
Looks like fun! The did Lola dirty tho ngl 😂
why would you put this racist in a movie?  lebron hates whites
Gonna miss pepe le pew.  Thanks a lot cancel culture.
I’m not saying that everyone involved with this production should be shot, however . . .
So sad they nerfed Lola 😔
NBA Players I recognize in the trailer  Damian Lillard is the yellow robot guy because it looks like it has a clock in it and Damian Lillard does the "Dame Time" celebration  Klay Thompson is the water/fire one because Klay is part of the Splash Bros with Steph Curry, and when he's on fire he can't miss, he also seems to have a ice form too which must be when he misses a lot  Anthony Davis is the one with the wings and the unibrow because a Pelican has wings and Anthony Davis played for the Pelicans for a few years before joining the Lakers
Nice
They missed a golden opportunity of calling it the cyberspace jam
I got chills.. didn't expect that
Id watch it, its for the kids lol
2:31 Aunt may been doing that spider man move 😳
So ready player one basically
MJ's magic balanced with the magic of WB characters in first.  Hope some extra cameos help Lebron out on this.  ie. let's see MJ!
All I know is that soundtrack better SLAP with some R&B
Wahh not like what i’m imagine
Flop
Please release the movie in telugu
Hilarious they gave lola the d Wade pass to lebron 🤣 😂
this is gonna be huge
COME ON AND SLAM AND WELCOME TO THE JAM
I'm sure the kids will enjoy it.
what I find funny is they legit cancel Speedy Gonzalez since they thought he was racist yet the cartoon is loved by Mexico and even has a song about him. lmao
Wow really stupid concepts  king James really?? What a joke awful just awful wtf
What the hell is this
Movie doesn’t fell like  Michael Jordan’s movie
Yeoooooo it's lit
Meh doesn't look as good as the first one
I wish Koby did this movie. Something just doesn't feel right..
They should’ve had the monstars come back and want revenge on the new age superstar player which is Lebron, do the same thing where the other stars powers get drained and have bugs break down what happened with Michael Jordan the last time they matched up not all this robotic shit
This movie is the definition of unnecessary.
Monke mahn
I’m the king of this domain  He keeps calling Lebron king every 5 minutes.
🔥💯
#restorethesnyderverse
#restorethesnyderverse
I honestly think this movie may be fun.
When do I come out
Oh....look.... Game of Thrones??
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Cuz if he’s a good athlete, he is a great actor!
nope
Bronny and Bryce should have done the acting
2:18 bronny on insta
I dont feel its going to be a nice movie. Its like LOOK LOOK WE PUT 3D AND CARTOONS AND JAMES AND LOOK AT MEEEEEE PLEASE LOOOKKKK
I'm not gonna ask
Nostalgia trip OVERLOAD
nba 2k+rocket league+ready player 1+Tron Legacy  idk wtf is that, im in
Lame.
What in the multiverse is this? I have so many questions! A few: Where's the aliens from the first one? Is the first one even canon anymore? And also was that the freaking Iron Giant??!!!!
Wish Lola and her curves back
meh
Trashhh
WTF HAPPENED TO LOLA
This movie looks dope as hell idc what people say. Dudes keep comparing a 2021 movie to 1996 movie thinking its gon be the same thing, mad annoying
They can NEVER top this: https://youtu.be/m1Iy9VSBg5A

Ayy
Bugs bunny? Yeah had to google that one. Maybe me grand da knows who that is
Ok but why is Lola no longer curvy??
It'll bomb no doubt... at least LJ's Chinese friends will support him by showing this atrocity to the Uighurs
Get ready for the merch drop.

How the hell LeBron knows how Toon world works when Micheal Jordan finds out at the last minute during a match. Lol
Going straight to the Hole, you ain't got no game. I'm breaking ya out the frame, coming through like a train. Looking to take over the whole world is my goal. With my unstoppable crew taking over control. You can't get none of this, we're running this. Well taker, earth shaker, 3 point gunning this. Get out the lane, I'm coming through. And if you don't wanna move I'm coming right through you.
It was never the shoes labran  😂😂😂
Why did they replace Lola with her chain smoking alcoholic Aunt?
Its ready player one, but basketball
2:10 nice touch with the wade and bron nostalgia
Was that Damian lillard?😂😂
5D movie
Heck yeah ,waiting for 16th of July 💕💕💕💕 from india
This looks good to me!
LeGM!!
Nooooooooo, lola bunny is less attractive than the space jam 1 version
Prions in the vax. Doesn't matter whether one is vaxed or not. The Prions in them will spread to everyone around them the same way the virus does. Everyone should start to realize within a year maybe sooner for some. Some believe as early as this fall when the US dollar collapses. I'm glad God has our back.
I was expecting a storyline of something like Bugs seeking  LJB help or something... idk what to expect. These remakes these days normally turn to shit.
Warner Bros y to you Se bendy in ni
That wink was the unsexiest wink of all time. Rip Lola Bunny. Gone but never forgotten
So Many Easter eggs I Can Not With to see This  Kong is Here can we get Godzilla too 🙄
hard pass
If they would’ve used lebron’s actual family that would make this movie better
Free Hong Kong Lebron.
I demand Godzilla and King Ghidorah too...
All I wanted was the Monstars. Boo.
I’m feeling like there should be a t shirt coming with Lola bunny and lebron mimicking that d wade alley oop
Am I the only one that saw pennywise
So, you're saying white and brown people don't matter!!!
Yoo... Lola Bunny is literally my Childhood Crush lol
Doesn't look great... That's a shame.
Omg
Jesus Christ our Lord and our Savior, is The WAY, The TRUTH, and The LIFE! Confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus Christ is Lord of your life. Believe in His death, burial and resurrection for the sins of all human-kind and you will be saved.                               May Father God, our Creator bless you in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior! ❤️😊❤️
Don’t tell me that the African Americans and forcing themselves Just to say Hey we must be seen while there be beaten up by other African Americans I have actually seen it is bad
Is it just me, or is Granny more attractive than Lola in this version?
Really shows what you can do with high budget
Ok so Pacific "RIM" 3.          🧢
can't wait for lebron to switch teams mid movie. hope the movie is honest to his actual career!
https://youtu.be/5cDuPTcwSeo
Classic. I love the theme just like the original.
MJ is Space Jam
2:27 i can't over this gold looking dude with a watch on his shoulder. He looks funny when he had that additude face. I want this as a popular meme! 🤣
Wack
definitely wont beat the original
Garbage. Watch it somehow become political just like all of the NBA.
I want the old lola bunny back :v
Wow,  looks like a psychedelic trip. Cool.
I guess this is one way vfx companies can reuse their assets before putting them into the recycling bin
I’ll give LeBron this: Jordan never pulled off this kinda acting
cringe
HYPE
2:30 didn’t know you can kick to shoot a basketball was allowed
CGI GRAND DAD BOIS LETS GOOOOOO
Lame ass movie 😂 Definitely won't be watching this garbage
Finally a sequal that won't suck.  Was worried about this happy its looking good.
YES!!!! MORE IRON GIANT REPRESENTATION!!!!!! <3
LEMICKEY MOUSE
G.O.A.T
Look, we all know this movie is gonna suck just by the look of this trailer. sadge for OG space jam lovers.
While I definitely don't DISlike this, it is missing a lot of the charm the original had.
Ready player one + basketball had a baby.
Thank God Lebron can act, otherwise this would be a total cringefest
This looks like shit please just redo the whole entire movie
Lol what is this we just want bugs bunny
Wanna Sprite cranberry ?
If MJ and Bill Murray make a special cameo on this, I swear I’m going to scream louder than my son!
It’s a no from me 😂 the story seems all over the place
Oopp
Wow, Space Jam for the snowflake generation. Hard pass.
This ain’t it
Oh boy lets do this
Bugs Bunny is a rapist....it’s officially cannon until further notice.
Hi❤️
Hi
I can’t wait for cinema sins to watch this movie
This was funny as fuck, but couldn't they at least come up with a more elaborate plot? Kidnnaping the son? C'mon Warner....
As a 90's kid this feels foreign.
Yooooo
We can make it #Restorethesnyderverse
“Heyy, what’s up doc?”
what just happened
It looks good, but I’m not sure it’s gonna live up to the legend of Space Jam the original
wow, this looks like shit
It better have Big Chungus.
Weeew
Something about this doesn’t feel like a sequel, oh well. I wasn’t watching anyway
Wonder if we'll see a Jordan cameo?
As a LeBronite, this is must see for me. Hail the king!  Anyway seriously I respect the guy and he is simply the goat for his off court activity. Even Skip Bayless said when it comes to off court LeBron is the goat!
I don't know if this is good or bad.
Shit looks stupid af
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Juck
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG17ypWnqzo&t=74s
2:10 My heart is cracked
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
The only bball king is his Airness #23 GOAT
How did LeBron get this role after being so oppressed and all??  Asking for a friend
Got to give some credit to the fact it’s not just successful stuff showing up, it seems they are willing to reference even the bad or mediocre stuff WB has had a hand in
They should’ve used bronnie Instead of a different actor it would be 10 times better
It looks like its gonna be just as funny as the old space jam okay im in
“ yawn “ 👎🏾
I dunno why but a miles morales cameo would be amazing for this film
1:26 hey look Warner bros gave them their guns back
Damn man wish the second was made with Kobe 10 years ago
Please don't tell me they are letting LeBron start an acting career?  Now I have to see this idiot even more now 😢
Kevin Durant version. It's too tough so he joins the Monstars and recruits Lola, Bugs, Taz and Granny to join him.     Jokes aside, this looks like a fun movie for the family.
when will we see a asian as main character?
1:40 omg i remember that movie
Monke
3C Films sent me here
So you ripped off Ready Player One, made it ghetto as hell with rap music (kids movie) and put a replacement Jordan as the main character, gotcha
Мысли Бога.  Всё ближе Исторический Новый шаг! Никто из людей к этому ещё не готов! Никто Новый не поднял над Планетой флаг! Никто не сказал, что пришла Эпоха Богов!  Люди сегодня в тихой панике! Власти считают, что это их победа! Они рассуждают словно маньяки! Люди верят, что у властей началась беда!  Каждый желает сопернику поражения! Одни верят Сатане, другие – Богу! Люди мечтают о власти свержении, А власть положительного для себя итога!  Власть желает над людьми управления! Она уверена: есть программа рабовладения! Люди же требуют своего решения! И те, и другие в полном неведении!  Мир – это Пространство Создателя! И те, и другие – нарушают Правила! Для власти нужны рабы – обыватели! .......
Rip monstars
LAME!!!!!
This is a movie that we are willing to see!
Ready Play(er) Ball.
Nobody make ironic racist memes about the grandma “going old school” on that guy.  Real low hanging fruit amirite?  So please refrain.  Fo real tho
I love LeBron, but his acting is terrible!
Looks stupid AF! Does this completely ignore the original?
#RESTORETHESNYDERVERSE
Be cool  !
Who already hates his son character?
yes we all loved the lola bunny moment.
Looks so bad
Srly.  Tha was purposes make. Movie. Get. His son. Back .   puffff. Nooo. Point. Watchin. Movie 😉👎👎👎👎👎
Ruined  it
ngl some things need to be left alone
Wait, what? That is cool. Except it is better.
How much y'all wanna bet this is gonna have politics in it
Lebron why did u even agree to this??? Lmaoo.  this looks so lame...he should have just made his own kids movie. Stop trying to be MJ and live your own life. 1st space jam was a classic. As far as "remakes" go, this looks like a fail.
This looks awsome cool 🔥 & remembering the legend Kobe Bryant 💜
2:23  There was me, that is Alex, and my three droogs, and we enjoyed a swell game of basketball with a refreshing milk-plus from the Korova Milkbar, here getting ready for a bit of some good o' ultraviolence.
Although this looks very different from the original movie, I really like the way it looks! Can’t wait to watch it
This movie is going to be  lit  especially with lebron.
ahhhh where's Lola's curves?????
Don cheadle and the looney tunes i am in.
Don Cheadle in this movie. Noice
So Pepe Le Pew was cut for being a bit "sex offendery", but you've still got the Droogs from A Clockwork Orange with a cameo? A gang known to be fond of a little ultraviolence and a bit of the old in-n-out.  What's next, a Bill Cosby/Fat Albert cameo?
you ruined Lola Bunny
Épico
Jordan did it  better and he didn’t even like making the movie. This guy is trying WAY too hard to be as good as the OG G.O.A.T
I'm loving the graphics!
Can't wait ❤️❤️❤️
1:18 King kong 😯
LeBron hit Bronny with the LeBelt so hard he sent good son back to the 5th grade.
Well looks like all the good stuff is already in the trailer - it’s not gonna be as good as the original at all
Avengers Endgame who?
Warner va con toda este año
Warner bros. Universe
If Ready Player One was sponsored by the NBA
No white or Mexican player? I'm offended
This movie is pathetic
Hologram: servererse. Me: SnYDerVeRSe!!!
Guess we know where Drogon and Dany went now
Two words: Heck yeah!
I laughed at the shoot the ball joke way too hard
Iron giants in ready player one and Space jam but we can't get a Iron Giant 2
Awesome trailer cnt wait.
this didnt have to be made
CHUNGA CHUNGA CHUNGA CHUNGA CHUNGA CHUNGA CHUNGA CHUNGA CHUNGA CHUNGA
I’m more excited for the soundtrack.
Bad copy of bad movie. Its Ready player one (and sone Tron). I beleve in this movie but now i think its gona be flop.
They’ve fucking ruined Space Jam .
WE DEMAND AN MJ APPEARANCE!!!
Looks stupid af.
Why are there so many dislikes . This looks fantastic
Was that drogon ???
CRINGE LEVEL 💯
No original ideas anymore
This isn't the space jam i watched decade ago
And now, we wait for the Nostalgia Critic on this one.
From the people that COMPLETELY RUINED Ready Player One...
2:23. I'll just leave it there.
Thanks, but I'll stick to the original. This one just seems incredibly forced and awkward.
Space Jam 3: Infinity War
The movie is so incredibly stupid it's funny
So, a sequel that completely ignores the original and bastardizes everything.  Typical f'ing Hollywood.  That'll be a nope from me.
I want to see it nOW
Space Jam 2 trailer
whats up doc ?
Looks good
https://youtu.be/SXd4m2VxJ4E
Wokeness will be the end of the liberal party
America shood stand together and refuse to watch this movie becuz of the pc changes involved in this reboot i certainly wont watch it i wanna see pepe le pue
It's time to get in the game July 16th
This finna be lit!!!
everyone gangsta till bugs bunny shows up and says his classic line 'meh, whatsup doc?'
I just wished that he got suck into the game of thrones world
MAKE AN IRON GIANT 2 ALREADY!
So did nobody see the mystery matchine bruh
This looks horrible
At least speedy gonzales is there
This is gonna be one big commercial like the first Space Jam. Garbage. Lebron a China lover.
i feel like they are bombarding the movie with too much cameo to cover up something. first space jam didn't need extra characters. it was just about looney tunes. that's why peoples saying this feels like ready player one.
This movie is gonna flop
The hell did I just watch
we didn't ask for this.
Woke trash
Woke trash
1:22 Starts in 2D 1:37 Transformation 1:47 3D/CGI
LJ👎. MJ 👍
Why him? Oh...I understand...😭
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
👌
I bet Race baiting and Pampering is the narrative of this story😀
I think bron makes the big slam dunk for the win because he did the between the leg and had the ball and he was going and then he hits a wall and he was still trying to catch the ally oop so I think he makes it
So let me get this straight: Pepe le Pew gets cancel cultured for being Pepe le Pew, but you mfs put the Droogs from Clockwork Orange front and center in the crowd....you know....ACTUAL ultra violent r*apists... Oh man, nothing like some good ol' manufactured outrage
I’ll pass on this
This will flop. Everyone hates LeBron. Complete disgrace.
https://youtu.be/VyoaJdZ6Qbo
This isn't the space jam I grew up watching. 🤨
Lebron beat the good squad to save the Uyghers! You have to save them!
#Restorethesnyderverse
Lebron was like “what in the matrix hell”
Yes
Oh look a "Woke" all black movie
I need to ask this, Where is the Space? You could have continued the original story and had Swachammer's kids or the original aliens return. But no, you went and recreated Scoopy Doo and the Cyber Chase. I'm going to call it now, The main antagonist is Lebron's own son or another kid he shunned away because he didn't take after his dad.
Gayer than anticipated
Nope.
I can't wait to see how bad this shit flops
So no Newman on this one?
I’m glad Lola isn’t as flat as the 2D promo art made her look.
Ewww Gen z remakes
Fun fact: zendaya is gonna be voicing lola bunny in this movie instead of Kath soucie, the original lola bunny voice actress.
IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE TO SEE KOBE HERE.
I ain't no bich sucka! Hut hut!

Does LeBron go out early after complaining about the air conditioning?
MJ did it 1st and LeBron copied
10 of the World's Funniest One Liners  1. Work is for people who don't know how to fish. 2. If you don't like the news, go out and make some. 3. Give me ambiguity or give me something else. 4.

Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.
Was this a true story? Did this happen to LeBron James?
Lola Bunny was doing the iconic Dwyane Wade alley oop to Lebron, she even got the pose
I'm actually impressed
Thank goodness they got Don Cheadle and not Kevin Heart.
I’m excited! I love my loony tunes!!
My god, James Rhodey
well at least lola bunny doesnt look weird in the actual film like that promotional art which made her seem high
This makes me want a Sprite cranberry

War Machine really changed since Tony Stark died...
Yeah, Elmer Fudd ain’t allowed to have his gun anymore, but Yosemite Sam?
This movie looking cool and crazy 😜
Michael Jordan better make some cameo in the movie
Lebron is a CABAL PUPPET
NOOOOOOO LOLAS RUINED NOOOOO
I want the old lola bunny
They gave Sam his guns back
🦬💩

Ready Player One, Space Jam edition.
My only hope for this movie, is when the looney tunes start losing to the goon squad, they say, "bring in the rejects" or something along those lines then the animaniacs start playing
Nice video❤
I hope they put Kobe tribute in this movie
wow woow woooow !!!! cannot wait, Granny OP
where is the big chungus
I can’t believe they put a old WHITE lady in the movie. There are plenty of minority women that could of played that part. That’s bullshit!!!!   Just mocking woke sjws when they somehow find something wrong with the movie
I’m ready to see this so bad let’s go
Wait why is Lebrun the lead instead of michal
0/10 Lebron chose Superman over Batman
I was NOT excited about this movie until they dropped this trailer on foenem
Jebron Lames.
OMG İTS MOVİE İS SO COOL,Wai..wa..w...KONG?😃
This Movie Looks Amazing It Would Of Been Legendary If Lebron James An Kobe We're Team Mate's In This Movie 💯🙏
The jokes are so old, they where funny as a boy, but now you know what they are before they're said.
1:18 All those characters are Warner bros IP’s I hope number 5 on that list is Harry Potter and if he’s animated he’s voiced by Daniel Radcliffe
space jam 3 stephen curry
No thanks.
He's a cartoon
Space Jam 2: into the Warner-verse
I just miss kobe
whose here for the Nicki Minaj track
Are any Sesame Street Muppets most likely to appear in this movie, since Warner Bros does own the rights?
This looks bad
i love charismatic afroamerican actors!!! , but i dont like mad afroamericans :( iam a racist? who knows
2:10 Lola pulled a D Wade
Nice trailer
2:24 Damian Lillard design hard thou I want an action figure of him ASAP!!!
amazing
WB  SPACE JAM VIDEO GAME WITH ALL THE CHARACTERS  we need it.
Ayee
Oh no, oh no, oh nonononononononono ih god no oh nooo
Lebron gotta leave acting alone n stick to basketball
Wow this looks like a lot of fun
#restore the Snyder verse
Lmao even pennywise had a cameo in this movie 1:45
This looks and feels like ppl will be jumping out of their seats. Nice!!!
Not going to watch this bullshit
I miss 2d animation, anyone else?
If Lebron wasn’t such a damn puppet maybe this would actually be interesting.
They couldn't come up with a better plot, after 25 years... 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️.  Ill use a free Redbox rental for this one. MAYBE.
This looks good!!!
Another BLM movie.  I'll pass.  Jordan beats Lebron again.
Boycott the nba,  no support for the CCP, no more Uyghur genocide,   No more support for the NBA.  They don’t care about civil rights if money is involved,      Be better NBA, stop supporting China and the Uyghur genocide.
yes maam it was real all of it..  doctor: do you have anybody to confess? any witnesses? james:. woman if he says its real then its real.. its animated anyways..  doctor: *existential crisis*
headache inducing cgi clusterfuck
How does a non-goat get this role? A passive player dependent on others to get a ring. With others so much better like Durant, Ervin, Zion, Curry ,Hardin, Paul  or even could have got the mailman from retirement or done a animation with the late mamba
Looks like every corporate vision of 'cool'. Meh.
Hollywood is officially out of ideas
I was excited for this movie but after I saw that this looks like ready player one, it disappoints me cause they really copied its concept. (p.s. I love Ready Player One)
Hot trash
Okay, but why did Bugs being transformed from 2D cartoon to realistic 3D give me chills? I can’t explain it.
Should animals have more eyes?
When he retire he gone become an actor
Kinda hard to distinguish the players from the audience in that last scene
Iran's alliance with  powerful and glorious china is the best option to defeat the US political, military and economic doctrine against Iran and the resistance front.
Racist clown.
Honestly. This looks pretty terrible. Big let down from the years of hype around it
Tek kelime ile berbat.
This looks more like Ready Player 2 than Space Jam 2, No thanks on the corporate circle jerk
Who’s powers they gonna steal though
The best part of this movie will be how salty it makes the LeBron haters. 😍😍😍
I’m not complaining yet. Ready Player One is my favorite movie and I literally hope this is just as ridiculous as the first.
Drogan?! 1:42
I thought jordan was gonna pop up out of nowhere 😂
Loving the Clockwork Orange cameo.
Kobe..
yeah, nah
that dramatizet background-music is soo unprovoked and annoying
Basketball Galactic
Calling it now. Twist villain will be Don Cheadle's character is a robot being controlled by Pinky and the Brain inside.
Bugs bunny is so racist
Hello I'm From Uzbekistan 🇺🇿🇺🇿 Uzbekistan

So they really cancelled Peppy Le Pew! 😅
This movie looks insane 🔥🔥🔥
I am very excited. But worry its just all special effects lol but either way.. its freaking here!
A boy asked a girl in a library: "Do you mind if I sit next to you"? The girl replied with a loud angry voice; "I don't want to spend the night with you !! Everyone in the library started looking at the boy and felt embarrassed. After a few minutes the girl walked calmly to the boy's table and said: I study psychology and I know what the man is thinking, I suppose you felt ashamed, right? The boy answered out loud: $ 300 for one night That's too much! and all the people in the library looked at the girl in shock and the boy whispered in her ear, "I study laws and I know how to make someone guilty ... 🤭    If you like the comment, please "write" on my channel ...

...really? Scraping the actual wood at the bottom of the barrel now.
Lebrong jame no charisma in this movie
Michael Jordan is already disappointed
To quote MJ: "Stop it. Get some help."
If any of the other remakes and revamps have taught us anything...it's that we shouldn't have high hopes.
This gave me physical pain
LeFlop wants to be MJ so bad! I'll pass....
So the Thumnail is Fortnite movie version >_<
Awsome.
They single handedly ruined Lola Bunny..
now that everyone has seen this trailer, go watch the black widow trailer 😅
Meh
This shit looks no where near as  good as the original one. This movie should’ve been called something else!
Flinstones 😁😁
Не дурно, далеко не дурно))
Jordan is still better
Does the cartoon of Lebron have the same style as Fat Albert? Or is that just me
Lebron 💕
LeBron acting skills 💪🏾💪🏾🔥
It feels like ready player one but crowded with TV shows characters
ready player one: basket ball edition
Gayyyy....no pepe le pue n no speedy Gonzales
The only thing I will be waiting for  is big CHUNGUS appearance
Nope wont watch it. lola bunny Is F up plus should of been Koby. WB you f up here

Me before this trailer:  -_- Me after this trailer:  O_O
Do you think bugs bunny supports Hong Kong?
#RESTORETHESNYDERVERSE
He wants Michael Jordan's spot soooooo bad 😂😂
its all good but his acting is................ no
Ngl, this does not look good...
So, it's official, Hollywood is out of ideas. Do kids nowadays even know any of these characters?
Looks like he’s letrash like always🙄
wtf is this
The special effects on LeBron's hairline are fantastic!
Not even a jordan cameo. Seems like trash
It actually looks pretty fun. Idk how i feel about the ready player one vibe with the cameos. Its not a bad feeling just unexpected. The end with granny is great and made me chuckle.
Where is sexy lola????👎
Come on and slam
EUUUUUUUGGHHHHH
#GOP #Republicans and all #LBJ haters are hating him more now! #KingJames #LetsGo!
Oh hell nah
Woooooooow 😊
The https://youtu.be/5pQvM9ZY41k things to come
LeBron will never beat Michael. This looks terrible compared to the original 🙄
Nice 👍👍
Ready Player Two: Lebron  😂
Who here is surprised the old Space Jam site is still up?
why are they tune land and the tune squad they're the LOONEY TOONS!!!! not tunes
Man can't wait to see the movie 😇😇😇
Wowwwwww
LeBron James entering Looney Tunes land and turning into a cartoon? It’s just like Enchanted...but backwards! I’m so excited!!!!😄😊😎😍🥰
Why is this #1 on training?
Bro why is Lebrun so fking ass legit stat padder and USA number one flop king
I wonder, does the space jam universe have ties to the CCP and if so, will LeBron speak out about it?
Yeah no thanks.
? goúd? 👁 wanna c it 👍🏽👍🏽.. Thx u 🙌🏽😤💀♎...
Oh Dear!
And then I find out he’s make 28.1 million off this 😝
Idk kinda looks dumb to me
Michael Jordon not Lebron James
But whyyyyyyyyy ???? THEY CAN NEVER JUST LEAVE SHIT ALONE
Lola bunny really got the Tsunade treatment
2:14 Flopping
Oh yes baby I'm totally watching this
This movie looks like hot garbage it isnt even like the old movie it has new awful characters and it isnt even set in a good place and the story how it happend is so stupid
Rip lola bunny
I already feel so much cringe in this, but its ok, its a kids movie after all🤷‍♂️
Tum log chutiye ho.
This Promises to be fun 🤩
This looks so bad 😂
1:46 is that it? like the clown?
Anyone else see it in the background 1:46
This looks absolutely terrible... recycled jokes and extreme nostalgia bait
Ew
Tamil dub
Pepe Le Pew gets canceled but let's have the goons from A Clockwork Orange in the movie (2:22)
Garbage
It looks so bad.. as it should be...
Cringe. But let's see where this goes. Might turn out good.
Looking at the cameos, it explains why this movie was in development for so long
this looks awesome I've wanted another space jam movie for so long and like I said the movie looks awesome
Copy cat wanna be, COPIÓN.
Ready player one vibes
На вид очень классно, много отсылок, но позиция режиссёра на счёт Лолы Банни не правильная на мой взгляд.
1:47 oh my Lola Bunny still has booba thank the heavens
It's just ready player one
We want sexy Lola bunny

For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life. ‭‭John‬ ‭3: 16‬   for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus, Romans 3: 23-24  that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; ‭‭Romans‬ ‭10:9‬   Everyone has sinned and needs Jesus to save them. Jesus is universally needed. This world is full of problems and tries to destroy/prevent faith in Jesus. Jesus is the way and we all need Him. We need to read His Word, which is the Bible and join a church and repent and be baptized.
Hopefully, the Chinese government approved of this trailer.
The CyberSpace JamEveryWBCharacter 2: A NewPresentationOfOur Legacy or Space Jam 2: A New Legacy, for short is going to be a fun watch for me. It sucks how much LeBron is hated because if Bean did this 10 years ago he would've gotten criticized too.
1:47 Speedy Gonzales!!!! 🤩🤩🤩
Who ever dislike this is a hater
1:43 I'm pretty sure that's just a recycled animation from godzilla vs kong

His son had as much screen time as tin tin

Haters will hate due to their obsession with MJ! Enough already! Let another man live! Bron not concerned about competition, regarding which film is better. Don’t watch if you don’t approve! Simple.......🤷🏾‍♂️
I’ve realised he being older makes me see kids movies differently
If only mj was the final boss
Not as good as the original space jam, but I'll watch it
Lebron is literally better than Mj at everything 💯😂 Basketball, Acting , and being a GM.
No
Flintstones even made the cut hell yeah 😂🤟🏻
💙💙💙
This IS Stupid. I LOVE IT
Cashnasty gonna watch this movie a thousand times😂
I knew the Goon squad would look this shitty, they must look all muscle and perfect - even fictional world has lost their humor  all in all - I knew Ready P1
feels like it gon be a big L
Lola got nerfed
How many of you want #restorethesnyderverse 🔥
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming
I wish Kobe was cast in this instead. The feels would've been different

This was amazing... here is my Trailer Breakdown: https://youtu.be/JM7Mm5BucMs
Michael Jordan  Now Lebron James   The 2 GOAT of basketball.
Nice!
Should’ve been Kobe🙏
Seems like sequel finally exceeded a original
Shoulda waited a lil longer till lebron was older
No.
Wow this looks awful.
even if it is trailer got goosebumps watching this!!!!!!!!! #kidfromakron #Newlegacy
That ain’t Bronny 😂
Boring.
The original one still looks better lol
Awwww it's LeBron, China's darling 🇨🇳
NO SIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!
#Restore The Snyder Verse
ok i never watched or liked the original but i’m so hyped for this
The lola bunny dont look that bad 🤔
Movie of the year!!!!!!💯
Why couldn't they have just done one with the gaming world and named it something like It's Just a Game
Meh, I don't like the 3D shit, everything looks awful and too over the top. But I will give them credit for recognizing "The Iron Giant".
#restorethesnyderverse
So many ridiculous parts to begin with... 0:54 that's what this is.
And he took that personally.
Boyyyyyyy This Shit Look Wack 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🔝
LeBorn is no Jordan  I can’t wait NOT to watch this Space Jam starring the biggest racist and the most radical China owned pawn in the NBA.  The best thing for all American children is to keep them far far away from this so called NBA mentor and pastor child of the Woke organization which is equal to deceiving our children of our future!  Woke culture is the biggest racist and misinformation organization in America today. It is how the CCP (China controls the minds of the weak). It all leads to death camps in the end.
Now I know why kobe bryant ain't here
I'm definitely watching this movie. And we got our friend Kong here to. Which is a coincidence after seeing Godzilla vs Kong he looks the same here as the movie well I think. Yep indeed I'm watching it. Can't wait to lay my eye's on it but for real not a trailer. Some people might criticize it but I think it looks great maybe not the best but something good and decent.
..dwyane wade spotted 🏀👌
Why take a good movie and fuck it up
restore the snyder verse
Jordan gonna make another movie
It's look like Ready Player One but with basketball
In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;  Ephesians 1:7

is it just me or did i see fucking king kong like tf😂😂😂
Anyone else getting some ready player one vibes
I'd give bron's acting a 2 but the rest of the movie is a solid 10
Wow, this looks really really bad. and not an endearing bad either (like the room or birdemic).
No one: Jordan after seeing this trailer: And I Took It Personally
What did you do to my bunny future wife? How dare you 😢
I know I want to see Black Widow more but I’m giving this a shot.
They really messin up a classic they need Micheal back not james wtf they doin this is gonna end wrong
Meh
Lebron only has to get one player in the team who will help him win the game easily and that is *BATMAN*
THIS IS INSANE I CANT WAIT!!!!!! WELCOME TO THE SPACE JAM!!!!!!!!!!!
MJ already coming out with his own documentary titled: The Last Jam
It's amazing what CGI can do LeBron's hairline
Yea covid go have to catch me for this to
#RestoreTheSnydersVerse
#RestoreTheSnyderverse                                          #ReleaseTheAyercut
Jordan should make a guest appearance
#tunesquad
Lebron : wheres my son  Don cheadle : boom you lookin for this
Breaking News so much fake xanax, oxycodone, adderall, hydrocodone and other prescription medications out there. Now  at   https://therxprescription.com/product/buy-xanax-2mg-online/ you can get FDA approved medication without prescription
Why
Director: So How many Easter Eggs and References are we going to put in this movie🤔 Warner Bros: Yes😊
Lebron puts superman on his list. Shaq and Dwight Howard both show up and fight over who he was referring to. Henry Cavill laughs in the background.
Wow not only was Jordan better than Bron on the court. Hes better than him on the big screen too. Looks absolutley stupid!
I’m calling it now tho KOBE GOT A SCENE IN THIS MOVIE
This is depressing
Can’t see the conjuring universe
Space Jaaaaaaam
#restorethesnyderverse
Scooby doo,the Flintstones,The mask,
This looks shit honestly 👎🏻
CLASSIC
Wait.......................This it's a big Crossover of Warner so................................Suicide Squad?
So tired of these picture studios not having an original idea. They have to resurface even looney tunes just so they have a new generation familiar with our parent’s parents cartoons
KING KONG IS HERE I LOVED
Space jam 2, GODZILLA VS KONG, suicide squad 2 best 2021 movies and probably venom 2
Where did Michael Jordan go  And where’s lolas umm coconuts
Warner Bros. Showing Off Their Properties: The Movie looks great!  But seriously, what is this.
Lebron is trash.
Hmmm
Ready player 1
I refuse to support an actor that supports modern day slavery while basking in the land of freedom calling it a land of bigotry.
But the real Space Jam is based on a True story. How will this one have the same core if the player in question didn't quit basketball for 2 years to play baseball before seeing the light? The Pathos if the movie comes from the 2nd 3peat. It is basically the most 1996 thing you can possibly imagine.
I was wanting to watch this movie until I seen the trailer. I think I’ve lost the interest.
Superman is a first round draft pick
A space jam sequel and ready player one sequel in one
LETS GOO!
worst shit in comparison to first
Let’s go 🙏🙏🙏
was the water goon squad member Klay?
So where mj i cant believe this rhe new space jam😁😁
Facts or undeniable facts?...the expectations are high. All they need now is the soundtrack like a song similar to I Believe I Can Fly by R Kelly
I don't know why that reminds me Cobe Bryant
This looks stupid as hell. And I'm gonna love it.
0:23 reminded me of Paul Walker RIP
Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)
is that don fucking cheadle
The Space Jam feels like an overcrowded Ready Player One movie.
Bronny and Bryce watching some random kid calling lebron dad for an hour straight: 😢😔
Should've been Kobe
We she said "you have to win for our son" I thought luckily it's just a movie.
Julian Newman be like: 2:23
Hollywood: How many of your properties you want to have a cameo in this movie???  Warner Bros: YES...
Warner: Let's do our own version of Ready Player One!  🤦‍♂️
Looks bad. Will likely underperform, if not outright flop. Lebron James one of the most hated public figures in America, if not the world (except for China, of course), and it's clear from this he can't act, either. All sports TV ratings are in the toilet, but NBA most of all. This movie's been delayed forever, the stench of failure is strong.
Wanna be Jordan so bad......
So is he gonna retire like Jordan did around the original space jam too?
Lebron James ain't winning no Oscars anytime soon.
Just what Lebrun needs. More money and more fame.
#RestoreTheSnyderverse
Robin 2:05 under the net
Was that a dragon from Skyrim?! 😶
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse #ReleaseTheAyerCut #JusticeForJohnnyDepp !
Now this, looks awesome!
My Dad is a Jordan fan and he likes it. 🔥👍 At least he's not a bitter old head.  Stop the comparison and enjoy the movie. Can't wait to watch this with my dad, for sure he have a big discount 😂 senior perks.🍿
Nobody:  Youtube: Looney Tunes Back in Action
I can tell this isn’t going to be good
Let me never watch this
Awesome trailer, made me smile start from 1:00 to finish.
Having grown up watching MJ’s Space Jam, I’m feeling a bit indifferent to this one. At least this generation will have their own, just like us 90s babies, had ours
Filme da minha infância, great
I better see an homage to Kobe
I saw Pennywise, a clockwork orange guys there and Game of thrones. I wonder what other characters we'll see here from TV-Y7 to -TV-MA
Screw lebron James and Warner brothers. They only care about Chinese money not human rights. Don't let lebron fool you he doesn't care about justice he cares about the chinese market
Yo it’s king kong 1:44
Wow the new @warnerbros #ReadyPlayerTwo trailer is looking interesting.   I am confused how first movies implies worlds are connected, yet sequel they are now simulated? So in theory we could have 2x each characters, Real and Simulated...
I'm not sure if it's right to put the Clockwork Orange guys in there. But let's wait for a film..
2:22 julian newman looking different
1:04 2D Animation ♡♡♡ just crying :')))
Tune world? Don't they mean toon world?
Bruh
Oh jeez Goosebumps all over me 😮😮😮
Looks awful
why lebron looks like animated
for a second I thought it was an NBA jam movie.
Was wondering when we would see a Space Jam 2.....yesssss by God finally.....
I like the jersey tho! Damn LBJ got a talent! This is what i like!
They tried the 2020 experience, but dude there's nothing space jam about this. Heck they even made the tunes CGI
King james 👑👑
2:23 umm is that the Night King?
looks dope its not space jam but it is lol seems like the perfect amount of tribute and reboot that is really rare
Animation instead of cartoon - this was the only thing I feared more than Lebron who kneels for politicians.
Lebron with the CGI hairline
Well of it's anything like ready player one          It's probably not gonna be good
Can not wait
Looks promising ❤️
Don’t know why they didn’t just use Lebrons real family
A lot of Lebron haters with the dislikes. I trust Coogler. He has a good track record.
If Spiderman 3 with Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, and also this movie come out this is going to be the best movie year
Space Jam + Fortnite + Player One = Mehhh
OK, WB. You have my curiosity.
I’m waiting for the moment in the movie where Lola Bunny removes her cartoon flesh and reveals her, and I cannot stress the psychic damage the sentence I’m about to write gave me, her sexy form.
This is shit😆
This might be the coolest thing of all 2021
Okay we only watched this to see lola
Lame not even close to the original
Mr Lebron James, I know I’m gonna sound like a dufus, in the event that life takes you to the youtube comments section, i just want you to know that I respect you and love and adore you so much. I hope you forgive me for telling my kids you are their uncle, and they look at me funny coz we’re asian.
C'est moche
Looks good too bad it's got LeBron james in it
ngl it looks like s..t
Modern day movies tryna remake old movies sometimes end up ruining it, but i have high hopes LeBron picks up where Air J left off
THIS IS TRASH!!!! RUINED ALL OF THE FIRST ONE
Lebron: "where's my son?" surely!
If I don’t need ID to vote then I don’t need to provide a ticket to see this movie.
Space Jam = Tron legacy x Ready Player One
Did the toons forgot they hopped with Michael Orr 😂
restorethesnyderverse
Lola Bunny missing cake tho.. just kidding.. just kidding. It's gonna be a great movie.
restorethesnyderverse
I'm not watching any movie with that fool in it... Maybe we should all go to the premiere and take a knee....... He's a great basketball player but a piece of s*** human being thinks he has the right to demand people to do what he thinks should be done because he knows how to put a ball in a metal hoop. James is one example of people that have too much money and doesn't live in the same reality as everybody else.
#restorethesnyderverse
🪦 Lola Bunny  Forever be remembered 🤤🙏
2104042016
Oh cool they have a lamia at 1:53
Lebron got Jordan thinkin “ He copy my drip my swag might as well call me ya dad cause I done fathered yo flow took it from me and we already now niggas done copy my style added they moved and made it they own”
What the fuck did I just watch lmao
Why did lola get nerfed tho🙁
👍
They shouldn't of never remade this movie.
Niceeeeeee
looks like shite. some originals are to be left alone
I have no idea how to feel about this
The like ratio is full of bots
"I need to assemble a team to win a ring"lol
Utter garbage
Please spoiler is there any big chungus joke
i wish all  space jam haters  a very *slam*
I refuse to give the oppressed multi millionaire minority, who is ruining the NBA with politics, another penny of mine.
😓😓😓😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
90mins of 'member-berries...
Hello guys, I have a scientific channel ‌ where I only post my inventions ... Be sure to visit my channel ...
I am sorry LeBron fans he is not MJ and iam a Celtics fan. LeBron is a athletic version of magic johnson. And LeBron is not the goat Bill Russell is 11 champions in 13 seasons . That’s champions than MJ and LeBron together.
As if we needed more proof that Jordan was better..
This is ready player one and into the spider verse all in one
Superman, Gandalf, King Kong, Iron Giant... Wow, what a team!
What is King Kong doing in Space Jam? You mean they are going to play in WB World?
Is this Ready Player Two?
Take this to another level. Actually despite everyone making fun of nostalgia i don't mind watching this. Everything gets a continuation now so i don't mind. (plus trailer actually looks nice) ;)
Looking forward to watching this with my kids
Haha! James is such a 💩 actor and cry baby.
Stick your Commie Propaganda up yours.
That is clearly Drogon from Game of thrones at 1:42
*GARBAGE*
shed tears into my eyes
Space Jam was everything when I was little so  I know this one gonna be litt
ready player one but basketball theme.
This is going to be the best movie of the century. Mark my words
now imagine if James Harden was here
This ain't it fam
If they don't do the arm stretch scene like they did in the past. Imma be Hella mad
I love this thank you for giving sam his guns back
*NOPE*
King Kong has 2 films this year he on a role 🤘💯
I'm not mad or anything, but *why the hell did they put The Droogs from A Clockwork Orange directed by Stanley Kubrick at the front row seat of the court?*
Warner Bros and Disney are killing it like Corona don't exist.
It looks so boring. All the old running gags and jokes from WB were cancelled by snowflake culture because everyone is too sensitive and even cartoons have to be PC these days. Lmaooo they even desexed Lola Bunny and ended her rship with Bugs for fear of being Me Too'd. Cancel culture has ruined everything, even cartoons. This movie is going to be a snoozefest. Would rather watch the original than this!
https://youtu.be/18eDq_Pgizw
The Lola Bunny D-Wade reference at 2:09 tells me this movie's gonna have all the references I want to see . Bring it on.
YOOOOO IM HYPED
1:04 o shit this animation is amazing
I cant wait for bugs and friends to be traded by Leflop 😂😂😂
😏
2:10 Hey, I seen this before!
Trash
Now what drugs were they on when they thought of this?
I have a feeling this might not work because the plot has way too many characters just to try to catch your attention
No way is that LeBron's mansion in the beginning of the trailer, that thing is way too small.
🎵 RL Grime - Scylla 🎵
WHERE IS CARREY
Lol 111k likes and 11k dislike xD
Another MJ version
Ok but does his arm stretch at the end?? & it’s gotta open up with the space jam song lol.
Rhodey really isn't doing great after Tony's death
Imagine  lebron trading them tunes
OMG
Ew China James
This movie sucks they took out pepe this movie is going to suck screw wb and loony tunes
Not going to watch that trash
Why they steal ready player one
🤣 a trash movie with a trash player 🤣 its ridiculous yet amazing how far ppl are willing to go to get a dollar
I love this😃😃😃
This looks like wet hot shit
Send em to the rejects
The flying monkeys from The Wizard of Oz are in this movie?
Bugs be lookin different this year and lola and the whole gang speedy Gonzalez
I am officially excited
So it's Ready Player One 2
Why are the droogs in the background but no pepe
I'm okay with unthiccing Lola unless you change her hot personality
Looney tunes
Warner bros..             Assemble
James Lebron: Breaks the Cartoon.
I realize this is a kids movie and that's great. But if they're trying to tickle my nostalgia bone with this, they're failing, as the vibes from this don't compare to the original Space Jam. Feels forced. To each their own tho. 🤷‍♂️🦎
READY PLAYER TWO: SPACE JAM
Even here James building his another recruitment agency
This looks really shit
I wish Kobe was here to be on this movie
This film just kills the other one why add the whole internet thing the looney tunes are supposed to be real not rejects story is so used a lot father saves son the other is to save nba players and cartoon Lebron WTF I’m not a that much of a Jordan fan but his one was fresh. But this film has potential rumours of Warner bros properties characters are in this film likes of Jim Carey as the mask also this film remains me of ready player one
Cringe
Lola bunny is a disgrace.
IRON GIANT!!!
I really thought James was for real, but how he had jumped in bed with the with the biggest human rights violators on the planet has shown the world the truth!!!   The CCP is the worst when it comes to modern day slavery!!!  Let me say it again the Chinese Communist are the worst human rights destroyers on the planet and to sell his movies James has literally turned a blind eye to it!!! Are you for real James ???  Wake up man !!!
Senior discount. LoL
Rhody I need help what r u doing here
Okay but why is the night king there? 😂2:23
غتنحت
I remember this SHOW BRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOO D BUGS BUNNY
1:48 Speedy Gonzales!!!! 🐭🏀Cant wait to see my boi in action.   *Arriba Arriba! Andale Andale!!*
Its straight up gay... first one is better
AND WE thought Avengers End Game Was The Best CLimax
Summer going to be great
Looks like trash
Hello please go to my channel and watch the video thank you
It's too bad those five aliens in the first movie did not come back I guess they will not Looney enough 😔
So is this confirmation of The Iron Giant 2?
Can't wait
fye
looks pretty lit
Lola Bunny's design doesn't look as good as the original
These cartoon characters are mostly unknown in Russia. The only reason why a Russian had ever seen them was Space Jam. Now there will be another reason, the sequel
Such a bad actor they had to animate him, as well as recruit the entire WB universe to help him win, just like in real life... MJ did it with just a few Looney Tunes. Lebron will never compare, not even in the movies...
Lola Bunny did the wade no look pass what a classic
Warner Bros: Makes Ready Player One  Also Warner Bros: Fine, I’ll do it myself
Looks fake to me.
This is embarrassing
Not going to be the same without Pepe!
I have the bad feeling that LeBron is a horrible actor😐
Thanks for the summary ! I don’t wanted to wait till July and spend 2h in a dark room
This trailer got better the longer it was on
This looks outstanding hahaha
No no no no!! Wtf are you doing!! This is a sport planet in the oasis on ready player one... Ruined..
The nostalgia
),
The animation is fantastic
This is the first time the Looney Tunes will be on the big screen since 2003!
is it just me or does this look like garbage?
Daffy: “Shoot the ball.’’ Yosemite: ‘’So anyway I started blasting...’’
0:23, 1:05 you can go Super Saiyan 3 hitting one perimeter shot but put you behind the Mic and you sound like a total bitch. A soft nutshell of why not one soul wanted you to do this... Stick to breaking your own Ankles.
This looks horrible...
Black actors, in black movie, for black people.. Soon white become minorities..
This looks epic I’m gonna be honest.  Saying that: it will never live up to the original
This is  Space Jam: A New Legacy Trash #restorethesnyderverse
RTX On
I wonder which character is going to floss
Well this looks like utter shit😂
Awesome but #restorethesnyderverse
Ready Player Space Jam
LeBron James
If everything goes well...... Space Jam 3 ft. Zion Williamson
It looks predictable and not funny
How high 2 , coming to America 2 I got the hook up ,like mike 2 ..all suck  Space jam is going to suck   ⛹🏽🤦🏽‍♂️
That d Wade scene with Lola was cold
why does Lola Bunny looks like my auntie? O_o looks like she's had a rough time between 1 and 2 while everyone else looks exactly the same XD
We need just a small maybe even tiny Jordan reference
Smh 🤦🏽‍♂️ they have ruined the concept of space jam ... it’s not going to be like the first one . They are not even adding the people that are in the NBA
Granny got game!
This better be better than coming 2 America
Was expecting all the Hanna s old Cartoon Network chars to be the opponents...

Bro this movie is coming in my b day so exicted
Нет ни одного белого человека. Это другое да, да.
Nothing beats the original Space Jam with MJ and Bill Murray ! 💪
So ready player one take two...
Please don't be woke trash.
Wu Hu... Bang . 🔥
1:07 monkey D Luff gear 3 lmao
🤢
1:44 *BIG   M O N K E*
woooow😱
Where the fuck is Michael Jordan? And why the fuck they make it like Ready Player One?
Well........at least the animation looks good?
Ok so quick theory. I think this movie will tie into the Hanna Barbara cinematic universe SCOOB! tried to establish. It could easily just be they reused assets for the charecters rather than modeling and rigging new designs, but you can see toward the end of the trailer behind that golden dude the mystery machine, the scooby doo cast and to the right side the blue falcon. All of which have the same designs as they did in their movie.
The alternate universe when Rhodey killed baby Hitler.
Wow the acting is phenomenally bad
So... 3d looney tunes? I don't know how I feel about that. It does seem like more of an advert for all the stuff that'll be on the WB streaming service or whatever.
Kwassic 😂😂😂
Why his voice acting so flaccid
well hbo max has been worth so far
That’s a no for me dawg
Ew in the realistic world lola bunny looks ugly
This actually looks great
What in the Matrix hell
1:05 wait a minute. Is he LaMarcus Aldridge?
Hey lebron
The first film was incredible. This looks a total mess. It looks like the same story had a 2021 gloss and WB threw every IP they own at it.   Willing to be proven wrong, but this looks awful.
If I go to heaven first thing I’m doing is wishing this world becomes a reality.
im waiting for disney to flex trans captain america
Found the The Mask at 2:07 😂
Alright. You got me with Michael Burnham
прикольно
Alig várom az új Űr Lekvárt
Editors - How much CGI would u like? Director - YES
Wish he landed in that game of thrones universe. lol
I don’t like how good the graphics look.
Idk how I feel about this tbh. It just doesnt have the feel of the original.
This looks awful. It's just a shitty version of the original.
is Jordan in it?
did such a great job... keep it the way it is.
Bruh did I just see the human torch tf is happening rn 😂
Please noooo
The first ones stakes were so low compared to this. I don’t see how this film can’t take itself too seriously, and something like this should be light. Idk
M.J. Is The G.O.A.T.
Damn Lola aged .
What if LeBron James had to go up against Michael Jordans team consisting of the monstars!
Senior Discount 💀💀💀💀
I have to review this for my channel when it comes out so I won't make any assumptions. With that said, there just doesn't appear to be much here but hey it can't get worst then the first one...and yes I'm taking about Lola.
Zen data is the voice of Lola Bunny!
It cant ever replace or even come close to the original. The original has the GOAT in it.
Why? What was the point of us waiting all these years (plus it should’ve been Kobe) just for this crap -booooo
This will be forgotten quite fast, just like Independence day 2. It's nothing but a mashup of things we've already seen 1000 times.
You already know that kid was hyped up when he found out he was gonna be in the same movie as LeBron
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse #ReleaseTheAyerCut #MakeTheBatfleckMovie
I am numb to this trailer. Like in some parts it's funny but in others it's like "uh, what the hell is going on?" I don't really have high expectations for this movie but who knows, I'll give it a try.
Hum ok ,  first they literally remove a character because he was problematic whereas he was a pure cliche and each times he does something the thing never work and came back at him ,   Then they change Lola   Now all of this
Wtf
Trash!
Can't wait just reached the first after this trailer dropped cant wait
Godzilla vs kong is here wtf 1:44
Spoiler alert: the original was better
01:46 pennywise the clown on the right side.
He is a Wak actor
Looks ok I guess but having don as a villain is straight up awful casting might as well get chanel west coast to play Big L in a biopic
Imagine your movie sucking so bad that you have to play on peoples nostalgia to get them to even consider watching this crab
Gandalf at #2? Blasphemy.
It's confusing...it went from Drama,Sci,-Fi, Animation to giant Cartoon Crossover....Its all over the place.
I woulda tually watch this.
Lmao that Lola Bunny D Wade reference
Старый круче
Interesting how the popularity of the Looney Tunes in the 90s brought about the existence of Space Jam, and now WB is using the popularity of Space Jam to make the Looney Tunes relevant again.  I’m not complaining about it, as I do love both the Looney Tunes and Space Jam, I just find it fascinating.
Ready Player Jam
Granny really punched out the big guns 😂😂
I would've shit myself and cried of happiness if I saw a cameo of Parzival and Art3mis
2:16 seems like a flop.
I hope Cartoon Network characters such as Johnny Bravo, Camp Lazlo, Grim, Billy, and Mandy, Ed, Edd n Eddy, Chowder, Courage the Cowardly the Dog and I Am Weasel appear as audiences in the film too!
this is gunna beee sick bruv
Looks like some social justice warrior garbage that will never stand up to the original made back in the 90s. But this is what we get when we live in a culture where PC is more important than art of filmmaking
I feel like I’m the only one here who cares about basketball
1:43 whaaat is that yogi bear???
Fk James n the nba. Hope movie fails
I’ll give it a watch.
Wanna sprite cranberry?
Leflop back at it again
I believe i can fly
This is the second live action movie I don't care about that involves the Iron Giant. Just make a live action Iron Giant remake already. You clearly have the model for it.
So it’s just a Ready Player One... with basketball
Looks just as bad as ready player one.
This is more like ready player-one sequel
i remember watching space jam 1 in my house when i was a kid cant wait to see this!
Who are fans of kong?
Wait, you guys deleted scenes of Pepe Le Pew (and ones where he reportedly gets slapped for his inappropriate behavior) but you felt it's ok to have the gang of rapists from 'A Clockwork Orange' in the shot at 2:24?
Is it weird that I’m actually hyped for this? Also I know everyone is saying this is like Ready Player One (and yeah I agree and I like that movie a whole lot) but I’m just happy that Lola Bunny isn’t overly sexualized and looks more like her appearance in “The Looney Tunes Show”.
Looks like the Oasis went all basketball 🏀 themed for the Ready Player 1 sequel  😂
Yeah this one is on a whole nother level💯❤️👏🏾
At this point I only care about the music. The amount of cringe I'm inheriting from WB, especially after hearing about the G. Vs K. missing 5 hour cut. It's disgusting to see how much this company Ruins multiple fanbases.
Haters having seizures
tweety bird is so cute
I can feel Lebrones James' ego expanding....
Just so you kids know Michael jordan in his prime vs LeBron in his prime Michael wins evetytime
The kid in me is still waiting for The Iron Giant to see Hogarth again 😥
basically ready player one 2
Meh, dosent have the same magic. MJ was a god of the times.
Thanks for Hindi dubbed WB...
Stupid
Grandma kill count.
Make it about football and people outside of America might be interested.
nope
All I have to say is ........ YUCK
It would have been cool if they got lebrons actual family
Who that female bunny again? 🙄
Visually, this is the Looney Tunes equivalent of Montero, but doesn't look like it's going to be much good. On a side note, anybody remember that SNES Tiny Toons basketball game from back in the day? Fun game.
Looking forward to this but also HELLA skeptical
It is not America anymore. It is Africa, lol 🤪
Sign me up for this one
Hollywood are out of ideas remakes are the thing now.
There’s only one king. And one space jam.
ayyy
There’s gonna be more millennials watching this compared to Gen-Z 😂😂😂
Wait did they say seniors get a discount or that was part of the movie?
This Good
Love this! <3
#Restorethesnyderverse
1:46 Penny wise about to eat the whole crowd
The Real Space Jam: Bugs Bunny Whatever this is: James flying in space.  Bro I am not watching this when it comes out.
This is going to be one of the best movies of 2021 Edit: who thinks if Kobe Bryant haven’t died he would be in this movie?
Ain't no wayyyyyyyy
так то в баскетболе ногами нельзя. А фильм выглядит кринжово)
This is probably not just Space Jam 2 but also a sequel to Ready Player One
Best movie of July 🍿 the trailer was all i needed
cant wait to see war machine playing basketball against the king
Soo its basically a documentary about lebron cavs team
Ah, a seemingly worthy sequel
This looks like a ready player one, basketball themed movie
same Oasis server from Ready Player One?
*Marvel:* Infinity War is the most ambitious crossover in history. *Space Jam 2:* Hold my basketball.
#restorethesynderverse
Space jam but with 200mill Budget
This looks just as ridiculous as it needs to be
Racist James gets a movie. Im sure he snuck a BLM in somewhere smh..
Would have been better if it was Kobe.. and he was saving his daughter Gigi
Fine Warner bros. take my money
Mj: bill murray & newman would do  LeBron: gimme superman & gandalf😏  MJ🐐 #GOATMENTALITY
Look up the Chinese genocide
Was that Drogon from Game of Thrones @1:40 ??
2:11 NO ITS ALL WRONG WHY
Already know they gonna butcher this shit. LeBron ain't no Jordan... who was a class act patriot.  Hes a clown.
https://youtu.be/0jEwXrAQu5 ❤️
If there was a movie I would be fine if I died and never saw, I think this would be it lmao
#restorethesnyderverse
DON CHEADLE HOLOGRAM                    DON CHEADLE  HOLOGRAM
June Foray would have gotten a kick out of granny's skills.
This movie is either going to be decent or horrible
Is that smaug?
I think more bronsexuals are gonna watch this over little kids. brb, need to brace myself from incoming comments from bronsexuals trying to defend him. 😅
Shooting foul by John Cena @2:13
Dislike for LeBron.....like for looney toons 👍
BGM is Dope AF❤🔥🔥🔥
So hyped for this movie man 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Personally, I wish the Looney Tunes were traditionally animated for the game otherwise it would have been an amazing blend of 2D animation, CGI, and live-action!
Clearly not the goat, not even close
This is gonna be good
I hope there is a big chungus in this movie
Trash I’ll pass mj forever 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Wtf is this 😂 King Kong and iron giant ?
0:04 is it just me that I noticed Marvin the Martian?
Hopefully this doesn’t flop lmao
Does he play for the CCP team Communist Chinese party
another nostalgia bait milk this ip cus the generation that it came out with is now old enough to have children to bring it too and we have 0 original ideas to use for a movie.....gunna skip this one
1:17 Lebron being Lebron.  Lmao
So it’s ready player one, lebron edition 😂
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
No... Just no.       you can't remake space jam it no longer works in this era. Don't dent a great movie with a bad legicies
I not going to normal with magic just wait
This is going to be a bullshit movie
Or could be. READY PLAYER ONE: A NEW CHALLENGER
Like always Jordon done it better
Ready Player One: A New Adventure
Wanna Sprite Cranberry?
Why is Pennywise in this movie? 1:46
Why are all these movies so racists!! Almost every new movie only has black people!!! SO RACIST!! BOYCOT WARNER BROS FOR WHITE RACISM!
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
this looks like a mess🤣
Nah.
If that kid was Bronny, we all know LeBron's gonna give him LeBelt
Let's rock and roll boys and girls
This is the toughest corniest jawn I’ve ever seen. Well..... I’m there. I can see hella old hatin heads watching the movie like.... Jordan’s is better 😂
What the hell lebrons acting got me 💀💀
excited for this one , love from the PHILIPPINES ❤️🇵🇭
I woukd watch this if it was Metaworldpeace
Granny pulling a Jeremy Renner from Tag with the moves on the walker.
Omg
But, just why tho?
They have to bring a new stuff are this would be dog water
👑👑 James
1:25  Shoot the ball Let's try this again Shall we?
i'm confused
While you guys can change Pepè Le Pew personality, you preferred to kick him out. You guys are idiots🙄😒
So they really not gonna make Lola thick huh? I hate this movie
2 decades!!! we've all been waiting for this😲✊😱🔥⛹️🌠📣
Can`t wait to watch this movie! I`ve watched the first one a lot. I hope I see a Michael Jordan picture or DVD case as the cameo.
AMAZING POLL
fire klay and AD as vulture LOL
Why does everything need a remake? Movie executives must be the easiest job today. Just remake other people’s classic original ideas
Bronny watching this : 😐
Bronny or bryce shouldve been in the movie as the son instead
Granny's still got it!
"Welcome king James" damn
Did anyone else see pennywise in the crowd?
The original with my Micheal Jordan is way better
Wait Elmer has his gun and Speedy is in there...
LeBron going to sell us Chinese children made Nikes now with a movie tie in?  I'll pass dawg.
THIS MOVIE LOOKS DRY AF...NO THANKS. SHOULD OF BEEN KOBE SINCE DAY ONE AND NOT LEFLOP JAMES. THE SOONER HE REALIZES THAT HE WILL NEVER GET THE SAME LOVE AS JORDAN THE BETTER. THERE IS ONLY ONE 23 AND IT AINT JAMES LAME SELF.
This is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life
To bad labron is in the bag for China : /
0:23 LJ’s son status: Most likely dead  LJ: Yells his sons name in lowercase.
Wetarded this will be
*Michael Jordan sees trailer*  Michael: That's all I needed.  That's all I need for him to do that and it became personal to me.
need to assemble an elite team ey?
horrible uniforms, horrible remake! Can't top the original it only disgraces the name!
You can't be fucking serious
Küfürbaz haydo var ya
U shouldnt of taken the skunk out of the show
Seems legit, hope they can mage as classic of a rap song like the original movie soundtrack
Congrats, bro!! 🙏🏀🥕
I don’t think this is it
I want the sound track for the new space jam
Disney: Avenger End Game is the biggest cross over ever, nothing can bea-  Warner Bros: Hold my carrot 🥕.
He did flopped even on mid air alone
King Kong, Drogon, Iron Giant, All the Loony Tunes This may be the next best eater egg hunter since Ready Player One
Looks cool
.... Why the fuck is Game of Thrones in this shit???
Dope
Don cheadle has the best dialogue when he said send this clown to the rejects.
Space Jam 3 gonna have Zion
Marvel dude: “Infinity War is the most ambitious crossover”  Me, an intellectual:
Jams
Wooooah...WHAT A RUSH!!!!!!
I thought, the first movie was stupid...
Congrats to Lebron. You found something else that Jordan did better 😂
I would love to see Bugs and Mickey share the same screen like they did in Roger Rabbit.
Michael Burnham I see you
Da bron jame
This better be good or I'm watching the first one again
The regular cardboard serologically exercise because colony definitely relax astride a slimy bite. fuzzy , wary captain
2:10
Easy entertainment for a quick buck for easily entertained audiences..
It actually looks good
New movie theater policy; those that were young when the 1st came out are ONLY allowed to watch it during opening weekends
Why do they keep teasing us with Iron Giant?  First Ready Player One, now this?  :( Stop getting our hopes up, there will never be a sequel...
Couldn’t they have chosen someone better than that sorry ass lebron James
KD better be the snake lookin player
Lebron james is a cry baby rich kid from richfield ohio hahahhahahahahahahahahahha
Listen I just want this to be on the public record: if you were not able to secure an MJ passing the torch cameo (preferably implying he, or some version of him is about to go 1on1 with LeBron at the very end, you should never have made this movie.
Loooool
What the heck did they do to Lola Bunny
Sooooo is no one gonna talk about Drogon from GoT flying in at 1:42 ???
They made lola ugly smh
For some reason the acting seems off, like delayed in emotions and stuff. I hope it isnt as bad as afterearth.
Easiest 'hard pass' of the year'...
Tron is that you?
So it's basically just 'Ready Player one' with LeBron?
Where’s Pepe? This isn’t space jam without him
Why would I watch this racist movie? You add cartoons for your agenda. That's sick
I was super excited But then cancel culture ruined it. No pepe Lepew. Lola has been ruined. I'll stick with the original.
I didn't know ready player one was getting a sequel, we've hit peak remakes/sequels with this one boys.
It shoulda been Kobe in Space Jam, not Lebron
Excuse me what the fuck is this?
I got exited when I saw King Kong, iron giant, the Scooby gang, the flintstones, and Lola bunnies flat ass for some reason.
The new NBA 2K Career mode looks DOPE!
Looks pretty good. Is Peppy Le Pew in it?
Why bronny not in this movie?
My reaction to this trailer 1:57
fred flintstone is real. run
Almost to be adults 17-18 year olds be like... “are we the only ones who saw looney tunes?”
This looks like garbage.
lebron i love you
W
READY PLAYER TWO VR.
this is a fever dream
I don't know why adults dislike this trailer. This movie is for the kids. Yes, I loved Space Jam when I was a kid but as an adult I may not watch it now.
This is literally Ready Player One sequel
Let's goo. The best player of last generation was Micheal Jordan 🔥 and he did Space Jam 1. Best player of our genration now is in Space Jam 2. The question is which NBA Player will be in Space Jam 3
Anyone getting ready player one vibes with the iron giant and that
Knowing that Bugs Bunny canonically is a struggling rapist makes this piece of shit of a movie +1 to overall score.
2:14 i guess wanda did that barrier hmmmmm
This looks ssiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiccccccccccccccckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
1:58 My face EXACTLY when I seen the Iron Giant!! 😭 No way
Do your dance
wb I'M..... I'M SO HAPPY  FINALLY someone made a cartoon rabbit
Space cringe
Trailer editor:  “MORE THUDS!”  But sir  *“MOOOOORE!”*
Are they going to address the ban on basketball brought on by the accidental and devastating discovery of the Chaos Dunk by Charles Barkley?
WHY'S THE SONG LOWKEY A BOP
1:24 'Shoot the ball'  So anyway, I started Blasting
Не испоганьте моё детство, пожалуйста.
Seems like it could be good other than the fact lebron is in it.
"it's not MY DREAM, dad. It's YOURS."
Me encantaaaaaaaaaaaaa
i do not see any asian and white in this movie.
Hmm this could be absolutely garbage or a pretty good sequel edit: or just fun but not fully connected explaining more of the universe
I still can’t believe they removed Pepe. I loved that skank and I feel like they should’ve modernized him instead of scrapping him off completely. There’s a lot of ways for him to be made into a character that’s entertaining for adults but still watchable by kids.
Bruh you can tell they made this movie during COVID with the CGI 😂😂😂
I like it, and Lebron is trying, but it also makes me appreciate professional actors more than i ever noticed.
the CGI has his hairline looking 🔥🔥🔥
Toonpur ka superhero 😂😂
be careful dont wanna end up crazy like the last one
Disrespectful 😂🙃
Damn the memes comin
Why i don't see any white actors here? It's so racist.
Smh lola bunny ain't shit now
Basically its warner bros.. So they must put Kong. Hahahahha
Would be Dope if Bugs would have told Lebron upon entering looney toon world, "MJ, is that you"
I still prefer the original version
I know I’m the only person that thinks there going to like it
The only complaint I have is how butchered the QCD Remix is. Other than that... LET’S JAM!
don cheadle
Can’t believe Kath Soucie got replaced by Zendaya. Celebrity stunt casting at its finest.
RIP Kobe... He would of been great with this movie...
Ugly animations.
ع٨٧٧ف3٣..  ققزززززق
#restorethesnyderverse
Did y'all forget when we were hating on this cause of Lola?
Get Luka Doncic for Space Jam 3
nostalgic this brings me back 💨💨💨 #spacejam
Wack
Yasssss
I know for a fact people gon' be sayin Bron flopped at that last scene XD
Sam. Shoot the ball. probably the only good joke in the whole movie.
We could have seen Bug Bunny make a slam dunk on Pennywise the Clown but instead we get boring Lebron James elemental clones.
Good to know that MJ's also the better actor...
HOW MANY SUBS CAN I GAIN FROM THIS COMMENT  CURRENTLY: 623
1 tweety sounds odd 2 lola bunny is supposed to be sexy 3 its not space jam without rkelly 4 why do this to one of my favorites
2:20 kawhi-sic, nice😂
still waiting on the Ornstein and Smough cameo
Lola Bunny??? What happened to the character, bring back the concept from the original movie. I will not lead the children to this.
I have to admit, I did not have high hopes for this movie but seeing the trailer made me excited for it.
I believe I can fly woooo
I'm more interested in the new version of the theme song.
Not gonna lie, that “shoot the ball” joke hit home hard.
Oh god please don’t make bugs real. Please.
How so Amazing 💋😘💋😘💋
Friend:  just shoot your shot bro Me: 1:26 Friend:  he's hopeless 🤦‍♂️
Everyone talking about the acting like michael jordan was christian bale or some shit🤣🤣
Congrats on ruining another classic
Is it just me or does that golden robot thing look like Dame?
Ready player two looks great.
They should put George Floyd in the movie as a tribute
Get ready for the original one's trailer to end up in your video recommendations
Better do this movie some justice
Where's Marvinn the Martian?
Yeah nah....
So, they ruined what could have been the greatest movie of this age.  Got it.  Still gonna watch tho
This movie looks like a crime against space jam. Space jam was one of the greatest movies of the nineties and this movie looks like Warner brothers and HBO took space jam put it in a blender with everything else that it owns drank it and threw it up. This movie looks like a disgrace to be called space jam. Even so I will still be watching it and hoping that it proves me wrong.
This ain't it bruh. Concept of a child following their dreams to this ? Sucked the life out of it literally. Rip #SpaceJam2 before it even airs
This script is 🚽, lebron should of left it alone smh. The trailer gives away the movie plot 🚽 , MJ - I TOOK THAT PERSONALLY
No
Spoiler alert: he wins the game and gets his son back
Space Jam Player One: LeFlop Edition. 🤮🤮🤮
Matrix ???? Hell
Please don’t be corny, please don’t be corny, please don’t be corny 🙏🏾
I already love thiss
This version of Lola Bunny is the definition of a downgrade
Ah yes, pure raw cringe.
This is gonna be bad hahahahah :)
I'm not feeling it , graphics looks good ... But something tells me it's it's not going to be that good
Stop complaining this is soooooo sickkk
Wish they wouldve brought in bronny for this
wow this is terrible
Cringe!!!!
another remake to RUIN OUR CHILDHOOD...MJ IS STILL ALIVE..A PART 2 WOULD HAD US THO..DEFINITE PASS ON THIS TRASH..ALADIN,MULAN AND LION KING IS A KICK TO THE FACE! WE DON'T WANT IT!!!
Why lola bunny look so weird
Looks wack :/
I liked Ready Player One so this looks fun to me lol
Aiight time to commit a hate crime
I'm ready 🔥
where's anthony davis?? thought he's supposed to be in the movie?
$$ > Ugyhur Lives
ALREADY!..... I can tell you this isn’t gunna be no where near as good as the first
Yo dame dolla looks SICK on the goon squad
Appreciate all the Iron Giant's cameos, but won't be happy until u guys won't release the 2nd . 22 years of waiting and we are NOT giving up.
Let The Ready Player One jokes begin!
The characters in CGI look bad. That’s all I have to say , I’ll still watch it and make the judgement there but I hate how they look and the background characters look worse. I get they’re background characters and are meant to be static but because you can make out who individuals are it makes them look so bad
How much characters do you want in this movie? Warner Bros: yes
Trash can emoji.
2:11 the lob from D-Wade to Lebron
I was expecting the classic song..
Shout out to those who got goosebumps when Lola Bunny did the infamous D wade and LeBron Alley oop 👀🔥🔥💪
Should've kept the cartoons in 2D
So this is Ready Player One, but with worst acting! 🤮
What’s with people nowadays and trying to replicate classics?
I thought the first one was stupid as a kid, this one looks worse lol
It’s just a bunny. It’s just a bunny. It’s just a BUNNY.
I’m hyped
Чую, редкое говнище... 👎
prière hopunopo
So not only he act like the nba all about him this movie issue is about him. Win or lose don’t effect the toons
Trash
Wheres pepe le pew?
don cheadle 😍😍
Rtx on be like,
idgaf about lola i want there to be atleast little shout out to Kobe
So let me get this straight...they took out Pepe Le Pew, but put in Yosemite Sam? Pepe Le Pew: A Womanizing romantic skunk who was a it clingy to a particular cat girl... Vs Yosemite Sam: The most non-politically correct character in Loony Tunes who actually hates most Democratic changes and would obviously be worse than Pepe Le Pew...  ...okay.
Want a sprite cranberry?
Did they really say babs was too sexy and changed her lol it’s a cartoon no one looking at a female bunny like that and I see old crazy fart still has his guns which I thought the was talking about taking away.must be water guns
Lola got nerfed to the ground
🔥
This is what we've all been waiting for. Quarantining actually paid off?!
Paula Abdul - Opposites Attract dying to hear this song with a real life coach and an animated Bugs Bunny whilst playing basketball I don't think it's going to happen but would be awesome if the song is played in that scene during watching this in theatres!  A 2 steps forward a 2 steps back with dribbling the basketball!
Eeeehhh!!!.... but it's not like I won't watch it anyways...
When I saw King Kong and Iron Giant, I knew this movie was gonna be good.
Animations off the charts 📈🔥🥶🤞🏾
Did anyone else see penny wise on 1:46
Looks like MJ is in this movie (Zendaya character in Spider-Man for those who don’t get the reference)
LeBron can't act. Just stick to basketball.
Can't wait 🔥🔥🔥
Looks Horrible. LJ has nothing on MJ.
Nobody:   Tony: did rhodey just stole my company!!!!!??
Uhmmm.... No.
DUMM👎
Original: Toons recruit MJ to play basketball against shorty aliens who steal the powers of pro basketball players and got swol.  This: LeBron recruits Toons to play basketball because an evil Don Cheadle living inside a Bitcoin farm kidnapped his son... Because reasons. What?
1:44 OMG It's King KONG
Restore the synder verse
Another movie that looks awful once again they should have left well alone.
Eyy king james❤️🎉
so bron had to make up an entirely new kid for this film, shoulda used bronny smh
OK...I'm interested.
The Grandma 🤣
it’s official lebron and Mj are now equal
Wait... Jordan isn't in this one? Shoooooooot... It ain't space Jam without Michael Jordan. But, this doesn't look too bad! Hope it isn't disappointing
This looks fun and quality appropriate for this day and age. Ill treat this move like I treated the new Jumanji, not expect to live up to the standard thr original, ESPECIALLY with the main star Robin Williams gone. The new one was in a league of its own and so will this one in my opinion.
WB is wrong 😐 for this...
I cant wait for this movie
THIS GOT EVERYBODY EXCITED
why
Oh hell yes
Get ready... For the Jamiverse.
How to this even Space Jam? The plot isn't even similar (and it somehow makes less sense than the original), none of the characters even remember playing basketball and the villain is a random digital man that wants to play basketball for a kid. Wtf even is this?
King James and Dom son 🦄☝️
WB: We cut Pepe le Pew because his influence is too inappropriate for the audience   Also WB: *puts fricking Pennywise in this movie*
looks exactly the same as ready player one
I’m srry but the “welcome to the space jam” playing throughout this trailer IRKED ME😭😭
I see why everyoine pissed about lola's resketch, it's a shame\
Hubiera sido mejor que hubieran dicho que primero michael jordan y ahora tu
the film looks worst than the original, but Lebron is way better actor than jordan
I thought I heard "What did you do to my son ?" -Ripped off!!!  The end
LeBron starting his Will Smith Acting Transition Early
Что за расистский фильм, где белые
It's awful, I mean it doesn't have the Space Jam vibe, it's just looks like another terrible, forced to existance, boring movie.
It reminds me of Lego Dimensions
MJ needs to recuit superman and stuff  to win while jordan won with bill Murray Jordan #GOAT
After seeing this preview It was just a turned off...1st of all there is only 1 king and he went to prepare a place for us. 2nd its disrespectful to MJ character to think lebron has equal standings as. Jordan is still greatest, he never left when he was losing or under stress. Shows loyalty and presences will pay off. Whenever old james loses he goes to another town with good players or he brings them to him. 3rd stop all the remakes. Some movies are best kept the same thats what makes them classics..their's only 1 singing in rain,citizen kane, 1 indiana Jones,1west side story and etc....thats what makes them great the longevity of those films...even kids today say old films were better. Remakes stink.
The last seen was amazing 🤣🤣
Man much needed so excited
This is gonna be the next biggest Warner Bros movie with lots of characters from different movies after Ready Player One! Only this time it's all Warmer Bros movies, no other characters from different movie studios.
0:35 I wish he would have landed there!
1:52 the Bosses looks sooo cold
OMG it looks so cute cant wait
Marvel *releases black widow trailer*  Warner Bros: screw it, just put everything we own in a movie and send it
Cant wait for Trailer 2 🔥
what a load of garbage.
Should have kept this one deep in bugs bunny whole no cap 🧢
You already know this ain't going to he better than the first but that's what's nostalgia is. So there's going to be so many dumb comments about its worst than the first
This actually looks watchable
So all cartoon network cartoons will be there?
Why is it called tune world and not toon world.Aww geez dont tell this movie is gonna be pc.🤦‍♂️here we go with this bs
Was that freaking Drogon?
This is a travesty they should never remade this movie
If they make a bad movie with bron bron in it ima kill somebody
Anyone gonna talk about Jamal Crawford
I hope they either acknowledge the first space jam or MJ makes a cameo some how.
And the  there was CG
Lebron James: How many characters this movie is going to have?  Warner Bros: yes
For some reason I was hyped but this seems to much
Well... I mean LeBron as a cartoon shows more emotion than his reality self
I was genuinely so scared there were gonna mess up but I’m actually really impressed
If theres no Marvin the Martian Im not goin!! Bugs Bunny dont get to floss his helmet and thats it! F that!
this has nice graphics but.  is it going to be better than the original?
JabberJaw's in this?
King james can't act
Ima copycat everything MJ ever did because I’m not creative or talented enough to do things on my own - Baby BronBron
Damn...that song is the pits
Interested to see what kids think of this because my kid thinks that all the stuff I liked as a kid in the 90s/2000s is lame and old. Graphics look cool though
"Just a kid from Akron"🙏💯💯
Looks amazing, can't wait. And those tune squad jersey are NICE, hope WB sells them
This is the dumbest thing I have ever seen
Leflop
Someone has to crop wade's face in his iconic photo with lebron lol
so he wont get his son back.. with a 4-6 record in the finals.. when it matters the most he chokes.. a cartoon movie with a sad ending..
After watching this trailer, Disney executives will put everyone from Avengers Endgame, the Star Wars saga, DuckTales and House of Mouse into Wreck it Ralph 3
I feel like this is going to be incredibly unfunny and they used the one good joke for the trailer.
in the trailer you can see the full movie 😒
Hey LeBron, shut up and dribble. Chinese bootlicker.
A movie no one wanted
If he doesn't stretch out his arm for the dunk, I'm not watching it
Trash.
Game of Thrones  Superman  Gandalf Iron Giant King Kong Looney Tunes
*B E A U T I F U L ! !! !*
Go team tunes.
First LeBron tries to take Jordan's title as the GOAT in basketball, and now he's trying to Take his movie to.
had no idea lebron v. don cheadle would be a thing
This movie will Only add to the Lebron Vs Jordan Debate
I was dying for this movie space jam a new legacy like wow holy hell
restore the snyder cut
Next space jam gonna be me in a rocket filming a tiktok dance
not feelin it...
Ughyiurs Need Freedom, literal freedom
Always happy to see black people getting work in Hollywood. Even if just small roles.
Children always love a good Clockwork Orange cameo.
Pennywise?!?!?!
But why’d they spoil the whole movie
This looks wack haha
I'll kill anyone who supports covid lies.
THIS IS LIIIIIIIT
I just know curry is the final boss in this...
Notice the Producer...From The Black Panther Director himself Ryan Coogler, that's why it's looking good!
In the first shot I see a switch pro in the kids hand
This movie is just meme material
It already doesnt look as good as the first one.
ANIMANIACS ARE GONNA BE IN SPACE JAM YEEEEEEEEESSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
yooooo, lola bunny winked at me
Is nobody surprised that bron actually might be a good actor
What chu do to my son 😅🤣🤣😅 this movie is going to be terrible
Wow
They should just called this movie “how to shit on a classic 2”
Black widow trailer better
Cartoons in 3D is gonna give me nightmares
Holy F... childhood nostalgia
Wow. That was everything I feared and more.
1:41 Was that Drogon from Game of Thrones ?!!
I can't wait to see it. It Looks amazing, but no matter what the first space jam will always have place in my heart.
0:50 Rhodey! What are you doing there?! Are you become 2nd Ultron?!   Tony would be dissapointed if he seeing this.  1:44 So that's Kong after his battle against Godzilla and MechaGodzilla huh? He takes a break and watching basketball match in other universe huh?
Cinematic trends noticed with Ready Player One and Disney (namely Wreck It Ralph 2) that seems less focused on telling a story and more showing off how many references can be made and the studio boasting how many IPs it owns. I have concerns. . .
Did Lebron really just say that he doesn’t let his son be himself!?
Will not take off
😭 why couldn't they just leave the original alone as a 90s kid I find this insulting
What’s Up Doc 🐇🥕?
The og was sooo good so I hope this will be good too
So is this a reboot or a sequel?
Looks so bad
see  you soon
Lola got nerfed
They did Lola dirty :(
They finally did it LOL
A minute of silence for victim of sjw's: 𝓟𝓮𝓹𝓮 𝓵𝓮 𝓟𝓮𝔀
*sniff* Ah it stinks, nice and good
Lola juicers? ModCheck
Im watching it just for Lola Bunny
I honestly can’t wait! And to those who are wondering why Lebron James is a cartoon in this version when he’s in the toon’s universe and Michael Jordan wasn’t THINK AGAIN! Cause technically Michael was already in the most “cartoon” way cause he had a toon’s stretchy abilities and reactions. Also, am I the only hope who hopes that they mention Michael Jordan when he helped the toons from the original movie? Also another thing, am I the only one who’s surprised and slightly disappointed that Lola Bunny’s original voice actress will not return??? Apparently Zendaya is voicing her!
front row courtside Devil with trident on right side at 1:53 ,  Car(tunes) (color) vs Goons (enforcer, hitmen) (black n white) looney tunes (infinite) tunnel. jammed in 1 space. Eagle (Eye), Android, Spider (Web), Water, Fire, Snake SINGULARIY, MULTIVERSE, DIGITIZED, HYPERCUBE (Court) BASKEBALL (Atoms) A "NEW" LEGACY
This is not gonna end well. I could literally make a list of everything that sucks. Don't even get me started
That’s some RTX they got there
Ah I the only one not thrilled by this??
dang,i never seen the first space jam,but this is dope,all movies right now are popping some pop culture icons,and going for fan service all the time,just seen godzilla vs. kong and it has a lot of fan service too,but i like it a lot
Shaq better be casted as thanos or someshit
Zendaya 2:04
What did you do to Lola
Why is he light skin as a cartoon??
#bitcoin
Comes out on my birthday
SO... It looks like it's not a sequel, more like similar premise. Am I right?
literally three-fourths of lebron’s family are played by different people
Have somebody play ACME arsenal? One of the Best games ever
iron giant? What is this, Warner Bros Endgame? lol. Idc Im dragging the whole fam to watch this
1:39 -> Mystery Machine with scooby with his head out of the window
😳
So trailer is just doing rtx on and off
This some ready player one typa bs
Did anyone notice how the dribbling robot looks like Dame Lillard Or was it just me.
Looks like generic empowerment trash instead of just basketball.
COME ON AND SLAM
Looks like sh.t. Comparing to the orginal. Even the plot is strange... And James should be real like Micheal was.
Co-starring Lebron James’ hairline
Nice call back to the D-Wade/Bron alley oop dunk.
Me before clicking on video: Ah yes let’s go the first trailer of the new space jam movie After: wtf did I just watch
U know what....ima watch it 😂
It's so disappointing that you think guns still belong in a kids cartoon.
Воу-у, чё это было? 😯
I'm not gonna lie. It looks beautiful.
King LBJ❤️❤️❤️
This Film Tribute To MJ23
Pepe Le Pew 😢
Yo is it me or the Goat of each Era has to be in a Space Jams movie . WHERE WAS KOBE OWN . And Who is Next Luka or Lamelo ?
Was gonna say it better have 3d
Another example of LeBron trying to be Jordan. Sad!
This is not about us 90’s kids but we will make it about us lol
Lebron James is a sellout
Some of the worst acting I have ever seen. Don't quit your day job LeBron.
0:55 What Rejects? 😳
This definitely looks pretty cool to witness and awesome to see the other Warner Bros. properties, in CGI no less, with the Looney Tunes, and it's great to see the Looney Tunes in both 2D and 3D, as well as hear a bit of the original movie's song (plus seeing Granny on the court is unexpected from the original movie as she was a cheerleader in that one). I am pretty hyped up to see this film in theaters and I can't wait to see it, yet the trailer isn't quite what I expected and hasn't blown me away. But maybe after seeing it more, I'll get more into it as I am with the release of the film.
Bring back old Lola bunny
Warner bringing all the properties, wouldn't be surprised if there's Mortal Kombat characters, Rooster Teeth characters (which Ruby Rose from RWBY would have been a great addition to the Toon Squad, she's got speed and is a sniper from beyond the arc)
Who else is excited to watch the new space jam after the original.
This looks 🔥
so basically, they made the monstars worse and also 3d
He is upset about his “son” being kidnapped by cartoons, but no concern for the people of Hong Kong or the Uyghur. Crap person, crap movie
Looks like an awful reboot. Very inclusive and cliché-ed. Tired of these dumbass movies
#RIPLOLA
This is so out of place, even in 2021
is it me or  I just like the classic one with Michel jordan
You'll never be better than #Jordan
Why are the looney tunes in a movie with a communist propagandist?
Baaarrrrbbbzzz .?
Just OMG
Guaranteed this will get good reviews. And not because it’s good.
Michael Jordan "Oh hell no. Hold my ball".
Im watching this on HBO max when it comes out
What have they done to Lola
Ehhh
Looking forward to all the symbolism.
The goon squad remind me Professor Farnsworth’s monsters
April Fools
So LeBron has to assemble a super team to win? That sounds about right.
This is beyond brutal
are the events the first space jam canon tho? or is that in a different universe or same multiverse? or director's decision? cant wait to watch this. 🥵🔥🏀
this looks like the silly fun time we all need right now and I LOVE IT
Its happening everybody stay calm stay CALM
You never let me just do me.
Lola not sexy wtff
Ready player one vibes
Granny got some mad skills
What did i just watch ? 😂
this looks awful sadly imo
Hagan a lola bunny mas voluptuosa ojetes

He doesn’t seem to be a bad actor.
This gonna be a masterpiece can’t wait 😊
This movie is going to suck. Hate when they try to make sequels it always ends up failing to the expectations of the film.
Ready Player Lebron
*Give us cartoon network cameos you cowards*
Kinda disappointed that Giannis turned down this role. Would have much rather seen him than lebron
Not supporting cancel culture. Pepe Le Pew did nothing wrong.  Edit: well they let Yosemite Sam keep his guns, props for that.
Osm💕
MJ ✊🏽
the D Wade reference
I was more excited for bugs bunny "whats up,doc"
They got King James and King Kong 🤭
*2:10** incase you missed that wink...*
That was bad
Lakers is the Best Team and LeBron is the greatest player besides Micheal Jordan and Kobe, he's probably better than Shack or Magic was.
Wonder how much China is paying King James this time
Damn! They even got Kong on the squad! 🦍
BOOM! U looking for this, King Jame?
The Space Jam feels like an overcrowded Ready Player One movie.
I doubt the remake is going to be even close to as good as the OG. The original is just so classic!!!
i can see the glimpses of Ready player one and i am happy
This looks dope ngl
Wasn't expecting Drogon but ok
too many of the top comments are from verified accounts.
Anyone rememberToonpur ka superhero 😉
Wowo🏄‍♀️
This looks fire
You want a sprite cranberry?
China
Why
Malayalikal undooo? 🤔
They ditched snyderverse for this!??!
Did int now that lebrons son was gone be on the movie
There has to be a reference to the website of the original movie. There just has to.
Oh so yeah this is a must watch
Did anyone recognize pennywise in the back ground at 1:46 ?
movie of the year already
Why is angry Grandma in this I bet a lot of y'all don't even remember angry grandma
Looks good so far.
goon squad more like the nets
generation of miracles vs. lebron james can’t wait to watch this.
Anyone searching the comments about lola bunny 😂
No. 👎 Nope 👎 No thanks .
Best loony toons movie ever
Something else Lebron could never beat Jordan at
I saw: The Mask, Scooby Doo gang,  The Jetsons, Pennywise, Captain Caveman, Thundercats, Blue Falcon, King Kong, Flintstones, Iron Giant, Yogi bear, Jabberjaw, Joker, Penguin, Robin, Mr. Freeze, Catwoman and Animaniacs :)
Shoot the ball 🏀🔥🔥🔫...😅😅🤣🤣🤣🤣
1. SUPERMAN 2. GANDALF 3. KING KONG  4. IRON GIANT 5. 6.
:lebron talking trash to jordan Hi jordan
Real creative. Wanna be like mike??? Whats next LeBron playing baseball??? 😆 your a joke!!!!
I've never been happier about a trailer
Garbage movie now
This would be decent if it wasn't so tech related like ready player one
No way this the goat movie let's gooooo!!!!!!!
Yea I can already tell this ain't going to be better then the original lol
I’m just glad Drogon is there to watch
Btw... He is not even close to being a king. More like a queen
Lebron lang sakalam
Trash
The LeBron James kid is really excited for this movie
At this point hbo max is the only streaming service i need now its everything
Original Space Jam was a hit cuz people actually liked Michael Jordan. This sad hollywood's running out of idea version is just a desperate attempt to make money off of nostalgia.
Lebron is soft and entitled. Jordan would eat his lunch
Holy shit never expected this
Where’s Mickey Mouse?
🔥🔥💯
Looks cool but I think the original will be better.
He ain't sweating 2:12 I don't know if thats good or bad
wait a min you are telling he could go to Westeros and ride drogon
I'm way too excited for this!
Literally all my childhood cartoons in one movie this is slammin
I feel like I just watched the whole movie
This movie looks so 💩 pretty disappointed TBH. This will never top the original! and no it's not because of Lola's design, The movie just looks trash in general. I wish my childhood would stop being fucked with and ruined FFS!
#notmylola
I came here to hate but that shiit looks good!
No good why animate lebron James??
It’s all fun in games until Jordan takes this personal!!!
This movie looks like it lacks originality and soul. It doesn't even seem to connect to the first one. It just looks like a Lego Movie adopted the space jam theme. It crams in as many iconic characters as possible to fill the void of not having an actual story. The 3D animation of the looney toons characters really looked terrible. What made the first movie good, fun, and goofy was that it didn't pretend its cartoon cast was anything more than cartoons. It didn't try to make them look real or a part of the 3-deminsional plan.
Too much cgi in my opinion like shouldn’t this be about a cartoon and how cartoons have slowly evolved from a form of stop motion to a fluid computer animation not whole load of cgi characters
If Jordan doesn't make a cameo in this. I'm quitting.
Wow. Talk about being creative and evolving as a sequel.
Why they do lola like that smh
Only the OG’s remember when we had to scroll all the way down just to get to the comment section,
I loved space jam
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Why did they needed to replace Michel
This movie seems lame asf lmao. Lebron cannot act to save his life. LLLLLLLL
Michael Jordan better have a cameo in this movie
Don cheadle goes ice tray from fresh prince
Well, looks like lebron james is been drinking too much sprite cranberry
this was 3 minutes of nothing but im excited none the less
Ladies and gentlemen official they have remove Pepe Le Pew and change Lola bunnies Style
Actually the one thing I do like about this, is that they have the original look of the characters not the upgraded garbage versions we seeing now a days.
I didn’t want to watch it but I gues it’s good
Did I see monke 🐒🥵🥵🥶🥶 monke came back from the heavens 🐒🥶🥶🥵
I like the trailer but all I want to say is #Releasethesnyderverse 🙏🏻
I can see the acting of basketball players hasn't improved.
When has it ever been a good idea to make cartoons look more realistic, bout to have a lion king repeat, and lebron is acting as good as a wrestler acting in a movie😳🥴
Just had to make the tunes 3d eh....naw I will pass
His acting was so horrible they made him a cartoon 😂 MJ wins again
Awww looks bad lol
OMG
Honestly they should’ve put bronny in the movie
OMG this is gonna be shit.
So bronny made it to faze but not space jam
2:10 ahh classic D Wade to Bron
Alright. I see you LeBron. This is looks like it's going to be a good movie.
Anyone else think of Kingdom Hearts as he was seeing each movie/show world represented as their own planet?
Lebrons acting is next level bad 😬
I can't wait to see this movie
I’m so over these remakes 😒
Yeaaaaaaaaaaaa ......no
2:25 those are War Boys from Fury Road aren't they? On LeBron's right.
Was that lil nas x? 👀
I prefer the monstars than these to much future 🤦🏼‍♂️🤔
the nod to d wade was everything
Wtf. Why does Lebron also become a cartoon??? That ruins the movie.
Oh shit here we go again
That’s not Bronny!
Wow this looks like shit
Not gonna lie, this looks much better than I expected
This actually looks amazing
So he’ll be in the playoffs when it comes out?!?
Then next one will be steph Curry Yoow and then space jam 4 will be bron x steph being teamates Yooo
Not feeling the CGI Animation. Really liked the cartoon style look mixed with Live Action more. Might see this but not right away.
MJ was better!
No wonder he's done for the season BEEN MAKING THIS MOVIE INSTEAD!!!
Wow the my destroyed space jams 🤦🏽‍♂️
Satanic Agenda!
*Hey, to you reading* ..... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
No thanks! The original will always be better. Better yet, maybe it will be a good movie because Lebron is good at acting, considering the way he flops all over the court.
this shit looks garbage, just leave classics as classics
Oh no,  this looks so lame...
It would be a full classic if bron passes it for the game winning shot
I get it.  CyberSPACE!  Also, a LOT of WB characters are in this one, also likely appearing, if possible, are CN characters, and maybe some RoosterTeeth characters, such as RWBY and Camp Camp.
What's Space Jam?
All the crossovers looked interesting, but the graphic changes and lack of seriousness and I'm assuming autobiography clips is going to make it a lot more kiddy and less entertaining.
Is it me or is that the weakest scream ever at 1:06 🤣😂
I speak for myself, and all 90s babies in saying this looks like shit. Insert bro, the nets, whoever you want, and it’ll be bunk. This movie should have never have been revived.
IS THAT THE MASK TO THE RIGHT AT 2:17???!!!
This is the real reason LeBron is “injured.”
More like, a whole new low
I already know this isn’t going to be half as good as the first one .
Lezzzgoooo...
Y’all couldn’t even give James his own son
Okay this looks good
Lol, it's such a cheap way of using 3d models from ready player one! If you take a good look at Iron Giant, you'll notice that some of his parts aren't finished, just like how it was in ready player one because Aech hadn't finnished him fully by the end of the movie!
Better see Kob in this.
PENNYWISE from “IT” on 1:46 Right of the screen!!!!!
爷青回
Oh no. Even in the movie LBJ recruits everyone. Superman, Gandalf King Kong. 😅🤦‍♂️
They should make James do that look he do when he hit gets hit
Imagine your king is don cheadle
look at James as cartoon, huge lips and nose just like all black irl 👴🏿 they actually didn’t nerf these
Looks like dogshit ngl
Even though Pepe Le is gone? I can't wait to see Badass! Grandma.
Bro the cgi looks so phenomenal, I can tell this is gonna be great
Godzilla smacked king Kong to a different movie😅
I hope it has a lots of woke messages.
wow lefrauds career has really gone downhill since winning a mickey mouse ring 🤡 🤡🤡
Who saw Suggs hit that buzzer beater ?
Terrible
Should of used bronny or Bryce
I cringed.
I’ll say one more time. It Should have been Kobe!...
I had low expectations for this from the first mention of it years ago. Now I've seen the trailer. Expectations were not low enough. This looks like shit lol.
Oh look it’s Pennywise at 1:46
lola...
This looks like fun. Sometimes I like to have fun.
Im wondering if Michael jordan watched this????
More than just Looney Tunes this time? Nice.
Really love how you just used the ready player one models for kong and the iron giant.
Yeaaassss 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
какой кошмар...
Endorsed by China made by slaves?
Dramatik change on lola bunny xd
Horrible movie trying to be the next big thing.
I’ll never pay a penny for this movie reason 1 lewoke
This is,  “Warner Bros flexing all their IP’s The Movie: Part Two”  Part one was Ready Player One  Edit: 😂I completely forgot about the three Lego movies! Lol.
This looks cooler than the old one
Looking forward to the new space jam song. And its many remixes
THIS FINNA BE A BANGER  🔥🔥🔥
what the fuck am i watching
N-world....
They better include some of the original music from the first one
Uhg what's next? You think you can play baseball too now
Ну такое.. тогда фильм актуален из за Джордана и мультиков популярных от ворнар бразерс, скучаем леброна не знают, как Джордана и мультики уже давно не показывают с бакс бани и остальными про СТС 😸😸
Ready player two?
ready player one looks even worse than before
So... no Bill Murray or MJ cameo?
Avengers: Endgame has the biggest crossover of characters in movie history: Space Jam: Hold my carrot!
N. O. means No. Nope, Nope, nope
Le goof James wants to be mj so bad
Why did you nerf Lola? Her looks were cool back in the first film
#restoretheSnyderverse
-_-
2:10 Lola Bunny as D.Wade
This low key look non realistic
Is that r kelly
Lmfaooo
Never thought I'd see the day where Bugs Bunny was in the same location as Geoffrey Baratheon... but uh... okay.  Not sure who felt the need to drop game of thrones into my looney toons, but it sure does exist. Sure does. Okay. Wow. It still isn't sinking in... check back in 20 years and maybe it will make sense then.
можно будет глянуть разок конечно!но поскорее бы уже вышел MORTAL KOMBAT!!!!
Liked before 100k lol
SOOOOO GOOOOD!!!
Corona & Lockdown makes people Crazy I think 😛
That's...no... Can we definitely remove the right to make anymore movie to Warner?
It just isnt the same... I love Lebron but this movie is trying to cash in on millennials but it is a kids movie. It just never works out that well
This is the dumbest copycat type shit ive ever seen.... Lebron is a goof. He doesnt matter.
I really can't stop watching this trailer   GEEZ!!!!
Ok, real talk, animation looks fine I guess but I think they give their fur too much detail, they don't have to have every single fiber visiable. And the expressions on 3d models are limited for some reason. The dooms squad could be bigger shock
now i know where king kong going after fight mechagodzilla
YOOOOO
Man, this is trash compared to THE SpaceJam
This movie gonna be epic
The effects 😂
was that rathalos?
They ruined Lola bunny so not gonna watch
READY PLAYER ONE: TOONament Edition
Trash. Joint looks wack!
Норм
Who bets that this is going to just be a beginning to a WB cinematic universe
I’m hoping for the Legend Kobe will cemo in this
The effects look amazing
This looks like dogshit
Kawhi is literally a robot in this one. 😂
Corny
They did Lola so dirty...
"The Clockwork Orange"
Damn even in a movie LeBron's assembling a super team. 😂
Oh we gonna have a lot more new memes...
Que Bueno si ablo en español es por que soi tica de costaRca
2:14 slam dunk reference
This looks just not that good should have left it be
Wheres pepe le pew and speedy? This sucks
Lebron is on a mission to save his son Jason Terry
Kid: “dad”  Bronny: 🥲
#RestoreSnyderVerse
Warner Brothers: Just put everything we own and add one sports guy and a MCU actor and just slap some title from a movie we haven’t used in a while
Dude I was watching parody videos and I didn't think this was real for a minute. lmaoo. talk about remakes galore.
Why isn’t this straight to dvd ?
What in the hell?
Do kids nowadays even know about looney tunes?
Mmm idk how I feel about this one.
Why are all the top comments lame joke attempts?
kinda cringe, canceling Pepe and Lola was not worth
Wack
MJ has to make a cameo
Magnificent job Warner.This was amazing and epic
i remember someone saying not too long ago they were never going to be able to bring cartoons together from different production companies they way they did for roger rabbit. i guess they were wrong.
NBA playgrounds be like
As someone who saw space jam as a kid, I saw this trailer and thought... WHAT YEAR IS IT
What’s wrong with y’all’s bitter asses man, lebron is literally just living out his childhood dream in following in his heroes footsteps. Nobody expects it to be better than the original but let the man live his dream and let us be excited to watch it happen damn.
They fixed his hairline in the movie
Hi
Oh my gosh pennywise! 1:45
I’m confused about the last score. Are you or are you not aloud to kick in the hoop
Oh my god they really did change Lola Bunny's design smh
No
Actually... it looks pretty cool!!!!
Guys what's no in Spanish? Need it for a test
Monsters were better
They changed Lola I’m so disappointed
bruhhhh
I fucking love you
Looks absolutely stupid.  What ever the first one had, this doesn't.
Welcome to the Space Jam
Everytime I see Bugs Bunny all I can think about is that Warner bro copyrighted Meatcanyon and now Bugs is canonically a rapist 😂😂😂
Tron ki yaad aagi
0:31 Let the Warner Bros. epicness begin!
LeGOAT !
Has anyone spotted a Conjuring-related reference in this trailer?
LeGOAT !
LeBron will always be in the shadow of Michael Jordan
Damn more cameos than ready player one
He is fucked , when bugs says ... Whats up doc
This look like ready player one just some how on even more drugs
Was that sonic, did I see sonic.
Oh shoot he an avenger
I'll take this as the true ending for Game of Thrones thank you very much.
Game of Thrones
Wow really the big lips again?
Bronny kinda looking sus
I hope the monsters from the first one show up in the end credits or something
Undecided but it doesn't have the feel of the last one
Terrible wtf matrix ? Where is the golf course going through the hole ? No  pepe le pew wow 😳 this sucks
I feel like i just watched the whole movie. I hate trailers like this!
GRANNY AINT PLAYING NO GAMES YO
meh
So michael jordan definitely has a cameo right
Ready Player Two
They originally cast Kobe Bryant
The old space jam will never be topped
#restorethesnyderverse
Bro wants to be MJ so bad.
I can’t stop rewatching this trailer! It is SO ADDICTING!!!
Let's see how looney this would be :)
Великое продолжение великого фильма, который подсадил на баскетбол огромное множество мальчишек в 90 - х! Но я как и прежде убеждён, что эта роль должна была принадлежать Коби...жаль, очень жаль 😢
You can't say you don't wanna be MJ. But everything you do is a reflection of him. Wearing #23, making a space jam sequel. In an after credits scene does he secretly recruit the best players from the other team?
This shit looks ode wack I ain’t gonna lie
2:23 even in 0.25x speed its still fast
What a classic 😂😂
old people doing parkour/gymnastics is my favorite anti-trope
The only downgrade- Lola Bunny and that to with zendaya's voice. 🤮
Lebron and his CHINESE COMMUNIST overseers approve of this trailer.
Pepe Le pew is too rapey so they decide to put Alex and his Droogs in the crowd? One of the most infamous and brutal rape scenes in cinematic history is done by Alex and the Droogs. Interesting.  Not to mention the Night King mad the War Boys.
0:23 the way he says his sons name when he could be dead for all he knows is just freaking hilarious
I can see myself watching this 100 times
https://youtu.be/f7i0T2cPneE
I went to see the original film, so that I would not remember this blasphemy!
When Granny said "I'm going old school...", I believed her.
lol what, stop
can anyone else tell this is going to be a terrible movie
Ready Player One meets the Looney Tunes?! Characters that did NOT appear in RPO, the game of thrones dragon, the flintstones, Pennywise, the matrix guy, and a bunch others. Only repeat characters are The Iron Giant and Kong.
Anyone else spot Robin at 2:31
this time without trump!  people attack capital!  look like people want revolution! people want change!
Looks sick! Reminds me of Ready Player One.
Kobe the only one qualified to take MJ’s spot. They should’ve finished this movie long ago with Mamba on it. Not this floopity flop chockity choke choked choker.
1:46  Pennywise?
Original Space Jam is a Classic! Honestly don't know what too think about a remake. 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
I’m gonna be honest, I don’t think I want to watch this movie
Bron: I have to save my son. Bugs: Listen. You don’t want to have a baby mama. Next thing you know you’re paying for her Ferrari. She’s going to want to get a big house, a mansion and to start a jumpsuit line, and you’re going to have to pay for it. You wanna go through that? Your baby mama’s car and crib is bigger than his. You can turn on the TV any given Sunday, win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai. She was suppsed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money, but she went to the doctor and got lypo with your money. Bron: What the F are you talkin about? Bugs: It's Kanye.
*Space Jam (1996)* Me at 7 years old  *Space Jam A New Legacy(2021)* Me at 33🥴🤯😍
LeBron went full light skin
Wow. That movie was good.  An it was free! And only 2:38 seconds lol.
Dude where's MJ for real!!! 😕😑😒
Damn they really laid out the whole plot scene by scene
wow nice movie LEBRON JAMES!
Lebron ain’t Mike
Notices that the DC Universe world is just Gotham and Metropolis.  DC Fans: I’m not surprised.
Animation lookin goodddddd 👌👌
how long is LeBron going to be in cartoon form cause I did not care for that!
Why is Don Cheadle keeping Lebrons son hostage to a basketball game?
Did anyone notice the mystery Machine at 1:38
Trailer is f*cking good,lets wait for movie.
China’s favorite NBA player LeBron won’t waste my money on it
Bullc.ap!!!!
Where is MJ!?
#restorethesnyderverse
This is 🔥
this is just Ready Player One, the sequel. *ENDLESS TRAAAASH*
Hol' up, I see Kong, but what are the other Titans doing? This continuity getting wild.
Easter Wiggle: https://youtu.be/uAMrvqhOHdU
Hell ya🐸
who is born in 80's will happy
This should have been Kobe’s role 😔
RIP lola, we'll always remember you 😩
This movie is coming on July 16. On this same day, one of the most anticipated south Indian movie KGF Chapter 2 is releasing. It means that there will be a clash(Hollywood vs South)
Looks good. Can’t wait
This is so exciting. .can't wait to watch my BASKETBALL IDOL KINGJAMES
come on, come on tell me, when is this coming out?
Why’s it still called Space Jam if the premise has nothing to do with space? I mean...the basketball game takes place in a VR Streaming Service world...also; why do the Toons seemingly not remember the events of the previous movie? For that matter, weren’t they living underground in their own world?
Ok time to bully them into remodeling lola so she’s sexy again
No no no no. Why can't we have good things and let them rest In peace. Why. Please Hollywood please fucking spare us these trash new age revivals already.
"Lookin like a double wide surprise, goddayuuummmm" 😂
Where is lola milkshake at
yo Bryce look like he from an alternate universe
There better be a big scene where every Warner Brothers cartoon comes and helps the team.
Real title Ready player one but basketball
I wonder how many techs will be called in this movie
Lola Bunny being a meme 2:10
I CANT WAIT IT COME OUT ON MY BIRTHDAY
I see Lebron traded Bronny for smoking 💯💯😭😭😂
They really fucked up lola's character
im a kobe fan, but kobe couldn't do this
I’m really Happy for Lebron and ima let you finish….but MJ has the best Space jam ever! Respectfully
What is this, ready player one part two?
Lola bunny’s lob to lebron is like Dwayne wades  lob to bron 🔥🔥
Janes donating all the money to BLM right or its all a show
2:23, White Walkers on the Way Left.
Donde esta pepe lepew?
Well I’m not looking forward to summer anymore
Lebron gonna trade my guy bugs if he still on henny
Huh... Wile E Coyote came before road runner. I would have assumed they were invented at the same time assuming those DOB are for real.  Edit: Looked into it and they are not... First appearance of Wile was 1949
Monke
No you can't just make shitty cash grabbing sequels ! WarnerBros : Greed for money go Brrrrrrrr.
Wait are Tom and Jerry just rouge A.I.
KING KONG & IRON GIANT: We've never been in the same movie  ME: Yes you have  KING KONG & IRON GIANT: We've never been in the same movie twice
This is ready player one the basketball edition
At last sequal to the masterpiece!!
Kids everywhere - "What the f@#$ is a Looney Tune?"
1:46, On the WAY Right is Pennywise
this is gonna sell out like Crazy, you kno3 how legendary this is!!!!!!!!
1:44 the characers from Smallfoot (2018) are next to Kong
Cringy AF
How u gotta whole different Son? must be an alternate, alternate universe
Trailer: #1 on trending. A few hours later... Trailer: Still #1 on trending.
Dont support the woke
Ready player two looks great
Ready Player Two: Space Jam!
1:39 Since it confirms all works of Warner Bros. will appear in this movie, I wonder if Storks, The Lego Movie, Rampage, Pacific Rim, The Meg, Steven Universe, the rest of the Monsterverse, the Banana Splits (not 2019 horror), Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Happy Feet, Legend of the Guardians, Cats and Dogs, Tom & Jerry, Journey to the Center of the Earth, Paddington, Wizarding World, Sesame Street, Regular Show, Detective Pikachu, Mowgli, Polar Express, Clifford the Big Red Dog, TMNT, Clash of the Titans, and Kangaroo Jack will make cameos?
So what happened to LeBron Vs The Nets?
i dont know about this one getting mixed feelings
Woah is that war machine???
Why is the Nights King, Clock Work Orange, and Morpheus doing in this movie?
THis ReminD me my CHiLDH00D``!!! THanks WarnerBr0s.
✝️💙🇺🇸
Kids would love it im sure. But.. Come on man lol smh
Love the trailer gonna watch the movie when It comes out
Basically the Basketball Avengers... nice
Never thought I'd live to see the day where Looney Tunes met Game of Thrones, but here we are...
If MJ doesn’t make an appearance with some special stuff at the end I’ll be very disappointed
Cantinflas y La India Maria @2:26  I could be trippin but just right of Bugs Bunny, I think I see Cantinflas and La India Maria (I didn't name her). That's crazy AF if that's the case. I already love this movie based on that alone. Showing love to all cultures, that's what's up.
LeeeeeGM : I need to assemble an Elite Team to defeat Brooklyn Nets.
Anyone noticed the droggies from a clockwork orange are in there go to 2:23 and pause it.
Forget it no one could ever take Michael Jordan’s place he is the greatest
Why so many dislikes....
Huh, so basically a reboot... that's titled like a sequel?
Looks like crap.
WOW!! It's Ready Player One all over again...but I like it.
Le’bron faked that injury so he could work this bro 😂😂😂
looking forward on this movie..looks coool oh and I almost forgot #RestoreTheSynderverse
this movie is going to suck big time. Lola Wade with the lob pass to Lebron was sweet tho
I guess they don't have any original ideas anymore.
Lola Bunny, how could they do this to you!?!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I bet he wins that game and gets his son back
1:07
Only here because of King Kong
Ok ima be Honest I wast too sure about this movie before but this has gotten my hopes up
I’m gonna watch this just because they have Kong.
Who is he :/?
Lebron I love you!!!
I see LeGm  traded Bronny when He caught him Smoking😭😭😂😂
okay honestly I can get down w this
Lola bunny 1:23 1:47 1:57 2:04 2:10
I'll never forgive you for shutting down the Space Jam website.
Sam shoot the balll😂😂😂😂😂😂
This looks absolutely terrible compared to the original. Another thing MJ will be better than LJ at. Plus why does Lola Bunny look different and the animation suck too
This is garbage. Never will be as good as MJ, Jumpman, Michael Jeffery Jordan, Air jordan, God disguised as Micheal Jordan, The Goat 🐐, Mr 2,3 aka Black Jesus.
+.
Please tell me this is a real thing because I really want to see it😝😝
When *Lebron* said that line at 0:28, I really felt that.  But kidding aside, I better see *Taz & Elmer* both scoring points or else just screw it.
Are you ok, Hollywood?
John 3:16-17 16- For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17-For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.

This looks so stupid in the best possible way.
F*** China James and his book about a weally weally smart man......won’t wear his shoes, watch his sport, or this shitty remake of a movie. LEBRON JAMES COULDNT BE A PIMPLE ON MICHAEL JORDAN’S BALL SACK.
I see this movie SCORING BIG! :)
Lola got nerfed hard
I wonder how much of this movie was filmed in china miles away from those concentration camps they have the uyghurs locked up in
yo bronny lookin diff here 🤨
Same shit,,,different black guy name.....
Lebron in the past year:  -Won an NBA title -Filmed Space Jam -Partnered with FSG to have a share in Liverpool FC, Boston Red Sox, etc. -Is playing in current NBA season with Lakers  He really has been active, hasn't he
There’s gonna be more adults watching this than there is kids lol 😂
Copied from Toonpur ka superhero.
What in the fresh hell.
2:10 James-Wade iconic dunk.
People disliked this because of the Lola Bunny incident. lol
Yeah... I still think you'll never replace the origional sorry WB
This is gonna flop.
Looks like ready player one
I’m 34 years old. Space Jam was the first bootleg movie I ever bought. I was 9 years old, and a man sold me a copy for $5 while I was riding the Marta bus back from a doctor’s appointment with my mom. So, my opinion matters here! I approve of this trailer 100%! 😃
2:09 D wade highlight😉
Bronny could of been in this movie lol
Nope nope nope nope!
I am really worried. I know its not gonna be as good as the first but please be close.
Ad, metal guy was dame water guy is klay but who's the fire guy??
1:26 😂.
For as long as we been waiting for this, it better be fire lol
Lola looks a bit better in this than in the original sketches I saw. With they would have left Pepe in and used him as a way to help teach young children about consent, cause we all know a lot of parents sure the hell aren't.
They really just assembled every show character ever
is nothing unique about it, they just substituted jordan and added graphics and some random shit
Will never be like the 1st one.jordan over LeBron flopping james.
🙂
Bruh small chungus and the iron giant
Lebron I can’t take seriously as a actor but still looks like a great movie
MJ space Jam: Come on and SLAM!  Lebron Space Jam: Come on and flop, baby, flop.
It's like the one with Jordan. But not as good
lets goooooooooo
Lebrons tha GOAT
Oh lord lbj acting is horrible 😔
I want more crossover films.
I feel like I just watched the whole movie
Que cochinadas es eso
Ready Space Player Jam
OH GOD, WHY? Why do you have to erase the past with your remakes? Your greed is ruining ppls good memories.
Everybody get up it’s time to slam now We got the real jam going down welcome to the space jam Here’s you chance do your dance at the space jam  Alright alright
The Goon squad should have been the NETS they already have the serpent leader kd 🐍
I hope they add some DC characters if they’re just crossing everything over like this
The prophesied return of the furries
i like the dwade lebron ally oop reference
Please have bill Murray
Goon squad? Doom squad? Wtf kinda name monstars are s tiers
The kid just wanted to play Fortnite :(
Ayo why I don’t see Che I was at the set last year
At first I was unsure whether I should take this seriously or not because I grew up on the original space jam I loved it as a kid because I love the cartoons so I was a little hesitant especially after we saw Brendan's Frazier's Looney tunes back in actions ,but after seeing this trailer I think I might give it a shot just to see how good it is.
Hey Yosemite Sam got his guns back!
This trailer ALMOST got me, almost, but when i saw the 3D, just meh, why don't stick with the 2D animation? it was one of the greatest things about the original but with the 3D just looks like every other animated movie, western studios has no creativity anymore with animation...
Who asked for this. Seriously.
After everything we learned in this vid nets in 5
1:25 MW2 akimbo pre-patch be like...
Bugs Bunny said it "Yikes"
If LeFlop won’t win this with Bugs Bunny, he’ll definitely join another team.
*WarMachine sends Lebron James to the Looney Tunes Universe*
Roger rabbit" whats up flop!!!"
👀👀👀😳
Lola Bunny so cute!!!
Can’t take LeBron seriously as an actor
Michael Jordan: “And I took that personally”
seen the 1st one its been so long for a sequel
As soon as Bugs started turning from cartoon to 3D I went "OH HELL NO."
Ready player two
Garbage .... the story make no sense and has  no connection  to the first one.
This looks terrible
Bronny punching the air rn
I’m surprised they allowed Yosemite Sam to keep his guns.
I already know this going to be trash
Is there kong
Imma be honest, this looks bad
Who tf cares about Kong, GET GODZILLA DANGIT!!!
look at what they did to our childhood baby momma Lola Bunny, she don't feel the same no more :'(
holy shit this looks amazing
I'm gonna watch this on shrooms. Yesssssssss.
Nobody's talking about this or is it just me who see RATHALOS flying there?!
nah
This like a mixture of the emoji movie and ready player one. Hard pass on this 🗑
ok I am in
Lebron: "Bugs, sorry, but I need Superman, Godzilla, and the Iron Giant to win this, not you Looney Tunes". *Bugs just gives him a flat glare* Bugs: "Well Michael whipped the tails on some Monstars with our help along with a fat man and Bill Murray, so..."
He actually traded Bronny
Endgame: I have the most ambitious crossover in the history of cinema Space Jams: that’s cute
Should’ve been Kobe rip
People that actually think this will be better than the original are 🤡
What in the ready player one is this😂😂
Esta película no me la voy a perder
Trash
Dude that is the worst bugs bunny impression I've heared in a long time
Lets go!!!!!!
Had to pick the least likable basketball player of all time huh? No humility, no morality, and no brain. Yeah real good role model for the kids.
*HYYYYYYYYYYPPPPEEEEEEEE*
I. AM. SO. EXCITED.
That's not the  LOLA BUNNY THAT I KNOW
This looks like cringe to me
WB: We’re cutting Pepe le Pew out of the film bc he perpetuates r*pe culture.   Also WB: *includes Alex and his drooges in the film*
We all knew lebron was a great actor with his flopping on the court soo
Can’t believe I’m saying this, but this actually looks decent. Was expecting it to be a lot more cringe, but I could see this being entertaining to watch.  Hope it is good.
Nah this is ready player 2
He better sell Michael Jordan around the movie
Oh...this looks not good
My wallet is already in tears for the sneakers that will come out for this movie
And the grammy goes to Lebron James - Best Supporting Actor
He looks like Brons little Fat Son
This is literally ready player one
What have you guys done to Ready Player One ?
They did not do justice to the original Lola Bunny Smh
didn’t really care about this movie until now, this shit looks good asf
Always remember, God love's you, Always♥️
Looks SOOO LAME.... should have stuck with the premise of the first movie... Not even going to go near this.
The music is fire.
So Excited.    Let the games begin.
Why is Kong and Iron giant in there???
LeGoat 🐐🐐
Oh look, it's memberberries the movie. None of the charm, useless reboot to the origins of the Tunes being real that they live in the center of the earth, haphazardly involving an incoherent means to shove a man saving his son into the movie that happens to be a basketball player instead of revolving the dilemma around the Tunes which is why the plot was so interesting.  Welp, guess I know which movie to skip come July.
Note really a fan of lbj but the movie looks fun so don't hate just Enjoy it
Gotta give them credit for going full send with the VFX
Was this filmed in china?
King James
Doo foo
omg king and the dream team 🤩🤩🤩
this is exciting
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that who ever believes in him will not perish but have eternal life 🙂😇
Yeah, I’ve always enjoyed the original translation, but the King James Version is easier to digest.
Super Warner Bros Ultimate
LoL. More Retreaded Garbage trying to capture the Excellence which was the 90s. Take off, Posers!
Well we know they win obviously
I’m not watching this
Hey, lebron actually is convincinly, unlike mj, his acting is actually good
POV:  You're trying to find people who wants to see that bunny girl from the first space jam
It's missing Bill Murray.
Damn granny got some moves
This is so bad
That's not Lebron's hairline
Very unexpected, looking forward to watching this however.
Roodey???
Is this a kids movie?
Everyone follows the GOAT. LeBron is no different, he is also following the GOAT aka. MJ
That's kind of lame, maybe it's a bad trailer.
Lol XD
Is big chungus there
Looking like a double wide surprise.
I think we found a bigger hit than Scoob no offense on anyone who likes the movie
Never thought I’d see King Kong & the Iron Giant in the same movie. Twice.
Bruh what is this shit? 🤣
Lebron: Where's my son?" War Machine: Boom you lookin for dis?
Señor yo selo dije que algún día yo iva a crecer
This looks like shit
Ready Player Two: Space Jam
space jam 2: the search for more money [tho in all honesty this looks pretty interesting.]
1:44 MY BOY KONG
Ready Player 2 looks different than the book.
They nerfed Lola Bunny.
Wow they didn’t steal talent this time 😁
Ready (basketball) player one
Hi you got the trending tap
why do they spell it as “tunes” instead of “toons”
Looney Toons: Endgame
just saying that MJ  got Bill Murray and Newman from Seinfeld and won.
Did I just saw Tony Stark 🤔?
Hot garbage
this is going to give us goosebumps
This makes me want a sprite cranberry
*sigh* its ready player one..... but with cartoon characters. Nice.
That's on another level there
The Ready Player One we deserve.
Doesn't make any sense
Boycott
don't tell me they're doing live action... dang it
This is gonna be horrible
Ready player one and Space Jam Combined 🤣🤣
1:41 Is that my boi DROGON?????
Space Jam 1 and 2 to be the best basketball movies of all time!!
Lola bunny look diffrant
So Lebron being so self centered couldn’t allow any other basketball stars into this movie?
1:53 old joker?
This looks like garbage
grandma had me laughing XD
Well this looks terrible
Trash
No
They had to change up the bad guys cause Bron ain't good enough to beat the Monstars
I’m betting most the dislikes are for Lola lol
Trailer 2 Please!
No Speedy Gonzales , No Pe Pe Le Pew  No thank you !!!
At 1:04 when Lebron lands the dust makes a basketball hoop
Ready player one ?🔥😭
Gay
Bron stick to basketball 🤣
🚽🧻
If Jordan doesn't show up, I'm not going to be happy
I still would break lolas back YA HERD MAY
R.i.p Lola bunnies tts
Nod to the iconic D-Wayde alley oop at 2:11
King James baby!
So this is the reason why LBJ is not playing now 😆
This is why it took 24 years to make space jam 2
After watching with I feel a little better about this movie. It doesn’t look like it’ll be as bad as I thought
I already love it I can't wait it looks amazing
This is gonna break the box office
There should have been a space jam with kobe
I DON'T CARE HOW EXCITED THE ZOOMERS ARE FOR THIS ONE, FELLOW MILLENIALS HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR EVER
AYO BUT LOWKEY- THIS SEEMS FIRE. AND IM READY FOR IT😼😤
this is better then elmo getting killed in endgame
So after James Rhodes disappointed USA Government about Cap shield who given to John Walker in Marvel/Disney universe, he came to WB serververse, become king in that domain universe and then kidnapp son of NBA star basketball player LeBron James to challenge him play basketball😂
I'm not a huge basketball fan but Lebron got to pick his team while MJ had to work with what he got.🤷‍♂️
There is not gonna be enough balls in the world for this movie to lick.
china was here
Let me just say that this is amazing my minds blown
2021 movies hit different
I kind of don’t like how they made a new version but with a different basketball player, but overall I’m excited to see the Final film
This wasn’t what I was expecting. Guess we’ll see how it turns out...I’m not keeping my hops high though.
Man that looks awful
Lmao they made the space jam movies more realistic lebron has much harder comp compared to jordan😂😂
LeBron finally  has good hairline as a cartoon 🙌
Good
#SavePepeLePew
I can't wait til Jordan sees this and takes it personal and comes back and does space jam 3 🤣
0:56 that blue character remind me of the blue light special bankrupt kmart had lol
looks like a really good movie
There may not be many other actual players in the movie, but god im so excited for this!
Nah this shit ain’t touching Mjs space jam🙅‍♂️
Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness looks lit
i don't know about this one chief
Garbage lol
Honestly looks corny as hell. LeBron is always second fiddle to MJ. In basketball and in acting 😆
This is going to be so cool!!!!!!!
God loves you❤️
Stupid!!! Will never be better than the original. Just like how lebron will never be better than Jordan
it Needs Yakko,Wakko and Dot and Harry Potter  in this Movie.
HOLY CRAP THE SONG IS BANGING
I love y’all!
Ready Player Two looks like it's finally getting released
Can we even consider this canon without Charles Barkley and Hoopz?
great micky burnham is in this
I can’t believe they nerfed Lola Bunny like that man.
🎵"I believe I can fly."🎶 NOPE😂 BOOM, you looking for this?!
Trash
New Space Jam comes out.  MJ: "and I took that personally".
Poor Poor Joker james trying to be like The G.O.A.T. Michael JORDAN But will never Be.
My lil bro dont think I can hit 50 subs in 1 day hook tommi salami up
It looks good but I don’t think it will be best then the first 1
Man im just glad Iron Giant getting more clout now a days, along with all the old classics
This looks cheesey af, but imma still watch
This look like It lacks any of the original's heart.
This movie has more characters than my Pokemon card collection ( I do not own any Pokemon cards )
I didn't see pepe le pew.. We are gonna miss you 😢
So this is what shrooms feel like
https://youtu.be/RGVsgMPCm-s
🔥🔥
Bronny pissed
They CGI’d his hairline
this abomination is gonna be good lol
Yooooo
On what platform(s)?
Purrrrr
Vera level trailer it's best
FINALLY!!!!
"Who went to watch MJ space jam after watching this trailer and tried to figure out which is best"?
We love Lebron!
Lola’s redesign is not it...
Ready Player 2 I guess?
Lebron got you the like 😂 best movie of the year 💪🏾
Lola....
This is great but #restorethesnyderverse
FINALLY
Excited !
Kick ball violation the grandma
Wow. this has a lot of positive reactions for a turd left in a toilet bowl for twenty five years. I mean at least the original log had Bill Murray.
If they can give me Wakko Yakko and Dot I’ll buy a ticket without another word
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
They should have MJ appear as a cameo in this movie.
HA.. gayyyyy. Go to North Korea with Dennis Rodman
Lola winked at me 😫
This actually looks good
❤️👌
Serververse? *You should've called it WarnerWorld!*     Actually that's a great name for a theme park...
In space jam 2 legendary basketball player Lebron James gets lost in the matrix with his son and then has to play and win a basket ball tournament against evil Don Cheadle to get his son back and his only teammates are the looney tunes???
Ready Player One meets PIXELS
Saw this as an ad on another video. Had to come here to comment that this looks like garbage compared to the original.
So they wanna cancel Pepe Le Pew and take away Lolas chest but in the background at 2:24 they got the dudes from A ClockWork Orange that Raped a girl ... Makes Sense
The acting is like LBJ phoned it in during NBA basketball intermissions
that uniform 😍
CheadleRunner 2049
So Ready Player Shoot basically?
Looks Just Terrible
God this is bad
Wow can't wait for this movie!
Lebron : Where is my son  Cheadle : Boom you looking for him ?
HBO Max is the gift that keeps on giving.
Welcome to an unneeded sequel
This looks way to extra
Lola bunny aint lookin thicc enough
I remember when I use to have the original on VHS and now I can see the new generation.
This is not my beautiful childhood, this is not my beautiful Space Jam.
So which IP do you want to use for this movie.  Warner Bros: Yes!
That was a kickball 😬
ALWAYS in the G.O.A.T's shadow 🤣
I’m so excited for this!!!
They shouldve used Bronny instead to make it more realistic
1:46 Pause it, you can see pennywise to the right
goosebumps
Damn welp that was basically the whole movie pretty good can’t wait till part 2
they got barkley's shut up and jam track in this movie nice
damn i miss pepe le pew
James ain’t an actor
I'm sorry but it should've been Blake Griffin
Lola hit the D Wade 🔥
2:12 Chaos Dunk
la bron jamms
what did they do to Lola????
“I got Space Jams on my feet, I'm on the moon” 👟🌝
Jeez... this looks horrible. LeBron just needs to play basketball. He can't act. Personality of a plastic bag.
So is Batman gonna be in it?
This dropping on my brother’s birthday
I lost interest the second they animated lebron.
This is gonna be crazy, I’ll check it out
Can't wait to see 😎
Awesome
HOLY SHIT
Why is War Machine holding Lebrons son hostage?
Now he's getting into acting...cool.
Just like In the NBA, Jordan did it better.
It's a shame Mel Blanc isn't alive to do the original voices but it should be decent
Mj team vs lebron team. Space jam 3 incoming
Wow this is gonna be bad
2:09 iconic
Luciferians gonna burn BYE BYE DEMONS
Lola bunny isn’t hot enough.
Was hoping for more hand drawn what am hoping is an even balance of both.
yo where's my iron giant 2 movie?
TRAAAAAASSSSHHHHH
2:24 ???
😳😳😳 it looks better then I expected
♥️♥️
1:17 Brooklyn Nets rn
I'm only there for Don Cheadle
Snowflakes: THE BUNNY IS OVER SEXUALISED WE HAVE TO CHANGE IT! (Guns shoot basketball) meh but that's ok.
🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮
I wanna watch 😏
Surprised that all the comments arent about lola
This is a HARD pass on me
to the people reading this comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     have a good day
This looks really fun! As someone who grew up with The Looney Tunes Show, it's wonderful to see all the characters together again! :D
Considering its Lebron, I'll take the Monstars in 6!
yo~ was that Rathalos I saw?? or something else lol
It.... Doesn't look bad?
Lebron beat bronny so bad for that weed he became a completely different person.
Where is tom and jerry
I think nothing can beat mj. Not even this chinese athlete.
King James🔥💯
Let's gooooo
Lebrón is cool
Please for the love of *GOD* there be an MJ Cameo 🙏🙏🙏
I mean, technically their not in space...
They pretty much spoiled it
Oh
Doesn’t look good at all sadly, but I’ll watch it. Graphics are great but the story line seems unoriginal. The first one was legit
Another opportunity to see a 3D iron giant I’m in!
I need theme song !
This looks badass holy fuck
I found penywise
can replace the original with CHINA JAMES
Michael Jordan only needed some looney tunes, Bill Murray and Newman to win his game. Lebron needs Gandalf and the iron giant? 🤦🏻‍♂️

I love this trailer
I smell a flop
WHAT?! I thought Warner bros said bugs bunny was gonna have a big noticeable bulge! They lied to us. 0/10
Why tf is Kong, the gang from 'A Clockwork Orange', and the Night King from 'Game of Thrones' in a 'Looney Tunes' film?!...  The 2D animated parts look great, but it seems the rest is just going to be pointless references to other WB films and characters...
*Childhood nostalgia returns*
Michael Jordan is definitely gonna be taking this personally.
WOWW
COOL wait
HOLY HELL THIS IS EXCITING

Lebron james just like a democrat leaving the hood.  Played fir the hood cavaliers left for suburban lakers. Claims he’s a liberal but resides in conservative neighborhood.
Im loving this already
LeBron the poser redoing Michael Jordan’s movie. Pathetic.
Welcome to the space jam! ALRIGHT ALRIGHT HOOP THERE IT IS!! OOP THERE IT IS!! OOP THERE IT IS!!
Lmao, didn’t even make it half way through the trailer... GOOD LUCK WB! 😬
I hope cameo in movie very nostalgia
HOW DARE THEY AIN'T NO NEW SPACE JAM GOING TO BE BETTER THAN THE ONE MICHAEL JORDAN DID.NO WAY.
Can't wait to watch this 🤣🤣💯💯🙏🙏👍👍👍💥🔥🔥
Dear god does this movie look awful
Lame, this guy was a kneeler so no support from me. Down vote!
Nobody wanted this. Nobody.
Alright I’m glad they still have Yo Semite with guns in rigid because I heard loony tunes said they’re removing guns from they shows
Unlike LeBron, I'll PASS.
#RestoreTheSnyderverse
please just be good
Who is crazy enough to dislike this come on
2:27 kickball...going the other way...🤓🙃
wtf is this
1:24 Sam and Elmer get their firearms permits renewed
It looks amazing. It's a must watch for me🤩🙌🏽
Bugs Bunny : Lookin like a double wide surprise god damn.
This is 🔥
Sammitty Sam 2nd amendment
you would think with a budget of 200 mill the 2d animation would be better... but it has the same level of 2d animation as a Saturday morning cartoon.  very choppy and rushed
Literally v e r i t h an am 💥💥💥💥💥💥
i'm not watching this... just because lebron james is in it
Looks shit
Holy fucking shit.
Wtf is this
Yeah.....                       No
never underestimate granny, according too canon she fought in WW2
Yeah....... LeBron is *not* an actor 😂
LeBron need to recruit an all star
2D animation is bad.....real bad.... he doesn't even bite in to the carrot. it just disappears
Nice ideas and creativity in movie.
The acting is cringy AF!! 😂😂😂
Honestly this looks pretty good. Always good to have new and appreciate the past. Called growing up 👍
This is definitely different than I thought when they announced this movie. I was expecting more of a sequel.
This actually looks good as hell
I see Lebrons acting on the court has translated to the big screen
im awesome, just in case you've forgotten.
Next Up: Space Jam 3, Starring Jeremy Lin           Like if you get the Nigahiga reference
You had me at The Iron Giant
lola looks better in the first one if you know what i mean
Garbage.
lola bunny is still terrible, no reason to watch this garbage
Naw you can’t re due this movie
This might be the dumbest shit I've seen since the Starwars sequels.
The Lola Bunny lob to Lebron Dwade style is the reason why I’m going to see this movie,....if she did that just imagine what else they have up their sleeves!
Damn, Lola Bunny in 3D was so underwhelming..
Stupid. So very stupid.
Anthony Davis character looks more like pascal siakam than AD himself 😂
Lets have them Re-Thicc-ify Lola bunny by complaining about her as much as we did with Sonic
How many years has it been since the last film 25 years?
Dude the d wade reference sold it for me
Billions of Easter eggs
The visuals look stunning, but i don't think it's going to be funny for me. I'll still probably enjoy it tho.
Cant wait for this..
For an athlete, Lebron’s a pretty decent actor
….Bill Murray cameo….
Lachinna James in space jam. What a joke, IT figures.nba owned by CCP.
Actually it’s not looks too bad
Will King James defeat ISO GANG?!???
Definitely gonna be a Jordan cameo
It’s close by my birthday I’ll be jamming
Plot looks very forced
Anyone else surprised Lebron didn’t ask the whole avengers cast to join him?
I may watch this when it’s available but idk at this point. The first one is so iconic and imo can’t be topped. The visuals look amazing but I still have a feeling this will disappoint a lot of the older fans. I just hope MJ is at the very least mentioned and the Monstars make a cameo somewhere.
anyone else see the robin in the background of the old lady after she scored
Nahh he aint jordan! 🤣
King James🔥💯
🔥
King James🔥💯
ZENDAYA AS LOLA AS IT SHOULD 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
This is a more ambitious crossover than Avengers Endgame
🔥
Pogggg
King James🔥💯
Jesus come back
Ew. Delete this
this looks too good to be true
Yeahh fk this
Nanny ballin,  That’s it, that’s the comment
DAMN!! THAT WAS 🔥🔥
This has the feels of "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" and "Ready Player One"! The good old days.
This looks so bad, I hope they didn’t pay Lebron for this awful acting and story line
It’s going to be on FIRE 🔥
Dear friends, when the violence starts, food prices soar and gas is given away almost for free then call on Jesus name and He will help because He loves you so ❤
They better have a clip of the kid saying leebron jaaymes
BRONNY SHOULD PLAY THE SON
Ye toh "TOONPUR KA SUPERHERO" Jaisa lg rha hai...😅😅😅a bollywood movie..
I'm not gone lie this is disrespectful to Michael Jordan on another level💀
1:21 Flat Lola Here is my dislike.
Looks 10x better than the original
Looks awesome!
Spacejam ruined. The excitement and the essence of what Micheal Jordan's had is actually removed from this movie. LeBron is good, the movie looks too fake if it's actually involving real people.
feels like ready player one all over again
Dis gonna be dope can't wait to see it come out the day before my birthday
Childhood ruined
So LeBron gets Troned, then has to play with the Looney Tunes against Don Cheadle’s evil team to win his son back. Ok
Ew another one there messing up and turning into crap
WAIT WHATTTT?
space jam  1 Jordan space jam 2 Kobe space jam 3 Lebron
He aint no Jordan
This looks FUN!!!
Bruh I’ve been waiting 24 years for this frfr I’ve been watching space jam since I was a little kid watching on VHS i can’t wait to see it
Ngl I thought it would suck, but this actually looks kind of interesting
I don't think mj had to do this
My movie is better😂
sighhhhhhhhhhhh................cartoons aren't banned from being 2D still............why's every damn US animated movie gotta be 3d anymore......2d animation is great.
Ok, now this is epic
Bald gang
A animação tá BELÍSSIMA!!
My WiFi password to my apartment in Brooklyn SpaceJam420 🤣🤣🇺🇸❤️
we need kong, the world needs him
I don't ever want to see Granny go "old school" on anyone's butt, ever again... 2:27
Yeah this looks dumb
No, this looks stupid. Labron will never be Michael
cant believe they did lola bunny like this
No thanks.
Imagine Kobe is the main character. #BlackMamba
Not going to lie, this looks really bad.  Its not even about space anymore, no aliens.. they should've brought them back instead of made it a new matrix movie... and we happen to know Lebron's real life family... so making this not actually match up to real life takes away the mystique I felt as a kid watching the original because it just makes you remember this is a hollywood production.  Idk, I'll probably stream it years later when its free but just disappointing already lol.  I guess the graphics are better but I actually prefer the original cartoons too
lebron james looks like a bad cgi render
Only if Michael Jordan was in it
Excited, looks good!
I cringed hard watching this trailer bro but damn I hope the movie is good.
LeBron can't act for shit lmao
i like the old aliens style that were mafia shitwas funny
DROGON!>!??!
U gotta start following the story line this is not it
Not terribly optimistic about this
Looks like ready player space jam
In the words of that little boy on the tricycle from The Incredibles:     THAT WAS TOTALLY WICKED!!!
"What's up, doc?" How I've missed this
Easily going to be one of the Top 10 Highest grossing films of the year  Even with it being on HBO max for a month
SO SHOOT BABY SHOOT anyone else got that nostalgia goose bumps

Lol reminds me of Ready Player One
We just saying Jim has a special place in my heart and if they can make it any better than that one you failed
Nose porque no siento esa magia. De la.primera.
MJ > Lebron
So he will save his son for sure...

Ready Player 2: A Space Jam.
Bruh I felt like I watched the full movie 😂
Wack!
Shut up and take my money!!
1:07 Me when my teacher says that we have homework on sunday.
Won’t be watching
basketball ready player one  still hyped though
So Warner bros buyed warmachine cooool lol
Too bad LeBron’s acting is more two dimensional than the actual cartoons.
💩💩💩💩💩💩
Me: cant be spending money atm saving up doo doo doo Space Jam trailer comes out Me: guess Ill need 20 bucks to go the theatres now
gawd damn
The perfect crossover doesn't exi-  ..............
like im going to watch this more then twice probably but my god that trailer was so souless
King 👑❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wait, it says "trailer", but I think we all just saw the entire movie.
So instead of the Flash movie , WB is using Space Jam 2 to introduce the multiverse. That's interesting.
Ummm I don’t know how to feel...
2:10 Wade 🤣🤣🤣. I loved that.
Y’all really did it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
1:46 Pennywise to the right
Ohh finally we know where drogon went at the end!!
"The animations looks Insane tho....."
Mj is the goat
Lebron James
Kenton is a douche.
2:10 rule 34 thanks you for this cut scene oh boi pls have mercy on our eyes
So apparently MJ is also a better actor
I still think uncle drew has better acting
There is nothing like everyone trying to be like Mike lol keep trying
This gonna break the theater!!!
*Come on and slam and welcome to the jam.*  Here's to another decade of that stuck in my head.
I don't know what is more respectable.  The amount of IP's Warner Bros has at it's disposal Or the fact that Lebron James wanted the Iron Giant on his team
Rl Grime!
Based on the "true" story of the 2016 Cavaliers championship run
I saw the iron giant and I'm happy
Cringe
Lookin' like a double wide suprise
👀
I wonder if they’ll get Dom back
“What in the matrix hell” 😂😂
At 1:46 Pennywise is on the far right!
It’s a good day.
Didn't the Looney Tunes learn to play basketball in the first movie? Also, can we stop with the goddamn "mOSt aMBitIoUs cRoSsoVEr evEr" thing ?!
Nice  👌
Awesome  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ✔
TRASH!!!!
Let’s be real. This plot is absolute trash. They really did my man lebron like this😤😭. Gave him a trash plot and some trash villains.
Would've like to have seen bron son be in the movie
This looks fucking awful 😭🤣
This movie look dope
This is just the secret start of the "Warner Bros. Cinematic Universe.", Isn't it?
I feel sorry for this generation that gets trash jam.
La Bron you so funny 🤣 how Those kids in China making your shoes doin??? Wanna say hi you scumbag???
“Is this a fake video?”  -Chris Smoove
Anyone else get TAKEN vibes watching the trailer

7700 Nets fan or GSW fan hit dislike
Better actor than mj 2
Am I blind or is Yosemite Sam classified as a Rooster?? 1:21
This movie be like: Welcome to 2021!
I really missed  Michael Jordan 😕
Is that Bryce?
Why do they keep switching from cartoon to CGI?
The  ABCs of Salvation, or how to be right with God, and know you're going to Heaven:  A-dmit that you're a sinner, and need a Savior.  As it is written: There is none righteous, no, not one. Romans 3:10  For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Romans 3:23  B-elieve that Jesus Christ died paying the penalty for your sins, and rose from the grave.  He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross. 1 Peter 2:24  For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures... 1 Corinthians 15:3-4  C-all on the Lord Jesus Christ to save you, and trust only in Him for your salvation.  If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9  For whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. Romans 10:13  The moment you "believe," or, put your trust in what Jesus has done for you, God saves you and your eternal destiny in Heaven is assured. You go from spiritual death to eternal life the moment you believe.  Jesus said it this way: Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life. John 5:24😀
I was skeptical till I saw the MVP of the show "Granny"
Is that Hannibal Morpheus?
“What in the matrix hell?” 😂
Lol its just 13 hours ago i thought they already make it last year lol
This is one of those "China approved movies".  Drowning in special Olympics effect predictable humor. Mulan 2
That remix of the theme song is awful. The original >>>>
It's time to let the new generation know that cartoons wouldn't be as popular today if it wasn't for these guys. Super hype!!!
Ugh... I got great joy when LeBron was turned into LeCartoon, because that stuff was funny and nostalgic, but the real LeBron stuff looked very unfunny. I know he's funny and can act, but eh.
Ready Player Tune
No tits no tickets! Sorry boys pack it up.
This brings nostalgia to the original, in a good way.
DA
👎👎👎👎👎
How is Michael Jordan really better than LeBron not just in basketball but in acting too
This looks dope. Not gonna miss this.
Why yall do this to Michal jordan
The special effects on this trailer is astronomical 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Meh
R.I.P. Pepé
this is retarted  its doesn't have the best player of all time /Michael jordon
YOOOO
He is about to trade everyone on that team
Another film using the iron giant for clout and nothing else...
Lemme Find Out Bron Can Act guess I need some tickets
YES, GUYS ITS ME FROM THE MRBEAST VIDEO
I have no idea what the hell’s going on and I like it.
Great movie as I say so myself
They straight up flexing on what they owed
Jordan only needed Bill Murray, not a superteam. Proof that Jordan > LeBron, always.
Make sure to have bugs be a struggling rapist in this movie because apparently that’s canon.
Nothing will beat the MJ one  I would've preferred Kobe RIP
IM 36!!! So they all got they prime back?!?!! “Quite possibly”  MAN THIS AINT SPACE JAM. WHATS NEXT ADAM??? YOU GONNA PUT 6 PLAYERS ON THE COURT? CALL KYRIE... CALL HIMMMMM! KYRRIEEEEEEEE!!! YOU SCARED OF ME OR SOMN???? WHY YOU NEED JAMES?!?! WHY YOU NEED KD?!?
Ready Player One much?
WOW! First I'm excited for Spiral from the book of Saw, now I'm more excited to see Space Jam The New Legacy! PS, Lola Bunny looks pretty cute in CGI just like Judy Hopps from Zootopia. 🐰❤️👍👍
The Joker at 2:25 haha
Who else is looking forward to seeing this in theaters?
So glad Captain Planet is in this movie.
This actually looks really good. Like it could be better than the first one
Its is Very similar to the bollywood movie Toonpur ka superhero
The Mask at 2:19! WOW!
Yeh they definitely ruined this
Warner Bros. It’s not to late to change Lola Bunny
and the final member of the tune squad..... TETSUYA KUROKO LET'S GOOOOOOOO
Man needs iron giant and superman to beat the goon squad😂😂
NAH.....old space jam was better
why they said king 😂😂😂😂it a joke we all know lebron is nothing
It's like if Tron, Ready Player One and Looney Tunes had a baby and that baby was raised by basketball
*My music is blowing up this year, speaking it into existence right now* 🚀
The old space jam is much better with out James
GOAT. 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
The Night King chillin' @ 2:22 lol
Let’s do it LeBron!!! 💪👑
Lebron james lowkey a bad actor 😂
Please don’t be Ready Player One.
1:38 best part
1:39 Scooby-Doo 😌😌😁
Anyone else see Drogon make a cameo at 1:42? Thankfully he wasn’t still carrying Khaleesi
Looks like a reboot than a sequel, but still hyped
No way
Ol goat James
I'm pretty sure that's Drogon
I’m hyped for this to come out
Super vibes 🔥
Dopeeeee!!!
If Rotten Tomatoes doesn’t give this movie at least 80% I am starting a riot
The sequel always sucks just like Laronda James
Feels like the new super smash bros video gamea
Wow this Ready Player One sequel looks great!
1st one will always be the best
At least LeBron can act better than MJ XD
SPACE 👏JAM 👏SPACE 👏JAM
1:17 Should have included the Flash and Dr. Manhattan lol
I'm actually excited
*This movie looks awful.*
It looks cool asf but at same time feel like there's to much is going on😂 original Space Jam was so simple and relatable and family oriented..this movie looks like a CGI mess. Ima check it out though Lebron acting seems to be on point.
*Sequel Idea - Lebron James goes to Westeros*
This is like a ready player one moive. Also the grandma shouldn't kick the ball.
LOLA BUNNY.. NO
* OH MAN .....WOW.....!! THAT GUNNY CAN JUMP JAM .....LIKE MICHAEL JORDAN 😏😁😀😏😏😁😀...... SO POWERFUL 💪💪💪..... THANKS 💛💛.....*
Lola Bunny is so Cute when she winks...❤️
I’m excited but it will never be as good as the og
I will stick with the original and act like this doesn't exist. My opinion looks terrible. Just another cash in on a classic.
Its all fun and games until they drink some water
DaBaby??
🔥🔥
They better include big chungus
Big Chungus better be in this movie
Wtf
Ffg g.j 8⁸
That old lady carried the team
Finna be fire 🔥
This looks so shitty
Still chasing MJ what a looser Laronda James
KLAY LOOKING LIT 🔥🔥🔥🔥
don cheadle
They better have got Overtime Meghan to play Lola Bunny 😭
ALL CHARACTERS: We representatives for our basketball team in our universe.  GOON SQUAD: Hold our basketball 🏀.   ME 1 YEAR LATER: I missed Pepe, old design of Lola and too many Easter Eggs just scrambling my mind. I hope Chip N Dale's Rescue Rangers new movie better than that one.
Flop
I want lusio and the alvin and the chipmunks singing jump shot when its half time
М да
Naaa Jordan space jam is 10xxs better I don’t see no action just like every other player putting Jordan shoes on
WHY WONT THESE PEOPLE STOP FUCKING WITH CHILDHOOD! BE ORIGINAL
I mean, its pretty much the same movie as the first one lol. Just a different story buildup.
Notice that only GOATS are the main carachter in space jam
Consoom your garbage
1:07 when lebron turned to IT
King James🔥💯
🔥
King James🔥💯
🔥
King James🔥💯
Omfg I’m sooo existed for this not even funny
This guy is so obsessed with Michael Jordan I can't believe it , be original bro.
OMG YES
looks pretty sick
This is cool and all but #restorethesynderverse
UNWANTED OPINIONATED HATERZ IN THE COMMENTS
a B movie rip off for Space Jam would probably be called Galactic Jelly lol
This guy seems pretty good at basketball, I think he could become one of the all time greats...
what  would like is a live action iron giant movie
This is a disgusting cashgrab job! Ugh!
micheal jordan did it better damn disappointing
how did they manage to make that song so amazingly unhype?
This gonna sound gay but I came for Zendaya😅😅😅#noshame Edit: Mad she got like 1 line but this movie looks really good. I know it's popular to trash reboots and remakes but I'm impressed. Also s/o to the big homie iron giant I knew he was still alive.
Without Pepe Le Pew this movie will FAIL
I will never ever watch this movie. I hate the wannabe 🐐 Lebron and changes to the female rabbit is stupid. There is only one Space Jam and only one 🐐.
I am sorry mine english is not to good to write but I see the first space jam with star jordan .  All time fun theater movie hope this one can stay be as great it look good and so erotic to watch people love the nba basketball in mine country.  So much erotic
So they kidnapped his son so he can play to get him back?  That's dark
Looks pretty stupid
Whats happen with lola?!
So this is actually "ready player two”😄
This is gonna be so shit 🤣
Not enough diversity
Kereeeen 👍 Mengenang masa kecil spacejamnya MJ🤘😎
If this hadn’t rudely interrupted me as a YouTube ad or I’d just seen a written review or poster for it I wouldn’t have given it the time of day. Cartoons, science fiction and horror are all genres I can’t stand. For me to be able to enjoy something on tv it has to be believable, if it’s not I’m out 5 minutes in. For once I wasn’t counting down for the skip ad icon to appear and I watched the trailer in its entirety! No idea why this got my attention, I’m not even a big LeBron fan but I was like I’ve got to make a mental note of this one as I can’t miss this! Totally weird!
It made so happy seeing the iron giant 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Monke 🦧
There better be big chungus
So “Ready Player One”, but “Space Jam” style!
this movie will probably flop just like Lebron
Its no wonder we will never get good movies anymore. Hollywood doesn't have to try with all the people that think this looks good.
Sam still got his guns? Iron giant? Flintstones? Went from I could care less to hey it actually might be good
Bronny looks different in this 🤨

Well definitely not going to be watching this
If I’m understanding this right: Lebron James’ son is kidnapped by the WB server and James has to assemble the looney tunes (within the server mind you) to defeat a rival team of computer basket ball players in ready player one? Why did they feel the need to change it?
MJ should have came out of retirement for this!
I got the chills when I saw the iron giant
This is gonna eat shit so hard.
Looks like ready player 1 but part 2
Another super team
1:46 Nickelsmart
No fuckin waaaaaaayyy. !! Ugh !
This world is living off the past, while making the present like hell. Lol
I remember seeing the first Space Jam back in high school. Keen to see this one. From the trailer alone, I'm going to share my (possibly unpopular) opinion: LeBron is a better actor than Michael Jordan.
Im just wondering why they did not use his real son😂😂
As cinema sins would say: “orgy of evidence that this is a Warner Bros. film”
Big fan from China ❤️, the space jam was showed in China back in 2001 ,guess what, all the tickets were sold out,I remembered the hero was Michael Jordan, the soundtrack’ I believe I can fly’ from R. Kelly was a hit songs there at that time, nobody didn’t know it,hopefully this movie has big selling in China as well
That's music is so🤩
I'll give that Lebron's dunk a 9 since it came from dwayne
This is just Ready Player One with basketball
And skip....
It’s like lebron pilgrim vs the world lol cgi steals the show probably
I wonder where I’ve seen this before
Looks like a great movie cannot wait to see in theaters
Wtf I just saw🙄🙄
Fact - BLM funds abortion clinics. 90 million raised by BLM in 2020, zero dollars used to help black communities.
Dom??? Where’s bronny ? Bryce?
If they don't make a Space Jam video game off this it's such a missed opportunity
Yet another "Reference: The Movie".
THEY SHOULDVE USED BRYCE FOR HIS SON
Still in the shadow of MJ and always will be won't be watching this crappy remake
If they're in the Warner-Verse,  then so is DC and Mortal Kombat....
We been talking bout this since like 2011
WB THATS WAS BEAUTIFUL CAN'T WAIT FOR IT👍👍👍👍👍👍😱😱😱🤯
Why is nobody talking about how bad is it lol
If this flops like Cyberpunk 2077 then I quit life
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
MJ fans bouta have a field day if this movie isnt as good as the OG Space Jam
1:24 Am i the only one who is loving how incredibly cute and adorable lola is looking in this trailer
Gotta see this. Looks EXCEPTIONAL!!🔥🔥🔥.  Bron is such an extraordinary actor.
ugh, she just looks so bad 🐇
Not sure why people are trying to compare LeBron to Jordan. I bet you Jordan is damn proud someone is continuing his legacy of Space Jam.
Warner Bros, how have you managed to make another great movie?
wow the toons look decent
This looks so shit.
Any references to the first
Finally a movie trailer that actually looks good
After Credits: *Lebron, his son and the Looney Toon Gang playing pickup* *Random Portal Opens to the Looney Toon World* *Someone comes out the portal* “So you wanna be the GOAT of Basketball, we’ll you gotta go through me first...” *Its Michael Jordan* *Movie Goes To Black, Space Jam New vs Old School coming 2024*
Take my money, and my son
And i just watched Ready Player One.
This is trash and the trailer spoils everything..
Why watch someone who takes a knee.  He would not save the universe.   He would only bow down.  Bring back M.J
I had low expectations when they announced this but the trailer has convinced me otherwise, this actually looks pretty good!
Peat is probably the cutest villain I’ve ever seen
Jordan beat the monstars with Bill Murray running point but LeBron needs Superman to beat Don Cheadle?
Y’all filled in the bald spots
Is no one gonna talk about how adorable Pete is?
They could have just used the actual kids and wife
Ok I can get with this. It looks like a good watch with the fam.
Anyone else who’s reminded of Ready player one when they saw this trailer
OMG THIS IS INSANE WERE IN THE 1900’s BOW LMAOOOOOO
FREE   Pepé   If Droogs are in the movie. The actions performed in clockwork orange are worse than Ol' Pepé
Since when did LeBron act 😂
Not the crossover we needed, but the crossover we deserved
Would have been better if Kobe had been alive and starred in this movie and not this bald ccp puppet.
Wut in the matrix hell
Brice?
old heads going to be mad about this one.. young bucks going to think its the best thing since slice bread.. im in-between those generations big 👎👎 for me not a lebron hater and not going to say i dont love Michael but this just looks like trash in my honest opinion. lebron could have made anything and i would support it but this just wasnt it for him.
So due to cancel culture Pepe le pew isn’t here?
LeBron: “I need to assemble an elite team…”  *Greg Oden, Michael Olowokandi, Hasheem Thabeet, Adam Morrison, and Kwame Brown have entered the chat.*  LeBron: "I'm out."
💩
Looks cool line of sucks there’s no continuity from the last movie tho
Okay bron with the acting skills.! I can’t wait to see this
Where LeBelt at? -_-
From Spider-man into the spider-verse to this, we’ve finally hit gold
Should of used the top basketball player of this era. Not queen James😂
Yessir
Ok I'm not mad at this though
Emoji movie?
🤩
If you’re already complicating it with all this stuff...there better be an Animaniacs appearance.
This is garbage
When I first clicked I was like not another  one. Like the emoji movie... ew. But I ended up leaving wanting more. Nice.
I was expecting the Loony Tunes... I was not expecting a Warner Brothers All Stars cast,  I'm ready!
He cant use bronny cuz he still smoking that Denver pack
I cant look at bugs bunny anymore after i watched wabbit season
This is crazy😀
Z    "$$'    knowledge nnnmmmnl    cwdwwxxc  hnnjfficnxn zbxb    b. Dxxmx nyo
This looks DOPE
I see u Dame Lillard )
Kids today dont even know the looney tunes. Should have done a fortnite crossover
https://youtu.be/lm4Da7-pn9I  You're Welcome. GREAT Trailer, can't Wait.
https://youtu.be/lm4Da7-pn9I  You're Welcome. GREAT Trailer, can't Wait.
BEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD I CAN TELL
Where's marvin? Isn't he supposed to be in the film playing with the others?
And people thought Endgame was the biggest cross over.
All warnerbros characters are here even king kong but wheres the scooby gang
If they don’t bring in Big Chungus we riot
Wait wait... 2:24 Alex and the Droogs from A Clock Word Orange in the background? Hmmm
1:44 There's Migo, Meechee and Gwangi (also voiced by LeBron James) from Smallfoot
Five little words, ladies and gentlemen... YOU CAN’T STOP THE JAM
#freehongkong #shutupanddribble
Just giving us both the classic art style for nostalgia and new-gen is cool af.
1:38 Uhh doc, i'm not sure about this.
Dude... MJ must make a Cameo in this film... this really hit my hard, I loved Space Jam. Can't wait for this movie to come out!
Wait he has a cartoon verse
LeBron as an actor pretty curious to see this one
Wished it was kobe
Absolutely LOVING the hand drawn animation. I just wish they would do it for  the whole movie
Should have recast MJ
This movie should never see the light of day
This movie looks like 💩
I know this is for kids but it looks like a hundred percent slapstick humor
This looks pretty awesome! But it will never make up Kobe Space Jam!!!
OH MY GOD GRANNY GOT THE MOVES
This is going to be so much worse than the original
King James🔥💯
LeQueen did everything by short cut just to try to steal everything from MJ. We should call him Queen thief
King James🔥💯
King James🔥💯
King james🔥💯
King James🔥💯
With the cartoony special effects and the nostalgia overload, I think I found my next movie to watch while tripping on acid.
Lebron cant replace mj

The bronze jame
We're just missing Pepe Le Pew!?
I was a very poor person, who was not always lucky when it came to playing the lottery.  I have played the lottery since I was 19 years old and now I am 45 !!!  ... which means that I have been playing the lottery for a long time.  The highest amount I have ever won was $ 400 ... funny, right?  But one day my story goes down in history after I discovered this man's name on the internet ... I heard that he is the best when it comes to winning the lottery ... well I never believed it, I just decided to give it a try.  My luck  !  for the last time!  so boom !!!  My life changed in seconds.  This man is a very strong voodoo who provides numbers that will never fail.  After all my years working and fighting to win the lottery, I finally won ($ 30,000,000) and it wasn't just what I won, there are so many more!  Dr. okiki the great!  is the name of this great person, send a message  or contact by WhatsApp now +2348071452791 ... percent remember that I am not writing this just for fun.  I have suffered and struggled all my life.  But now I'm okay!  So I know that many other people have been through the same thing and are still going through it !!  Only then is it possible to win the lottery and not miss this opportunity!  It's life changing!  you can also be happy in these parties with your family and friends !!  don't you dare miss this opportunity !!  I'm saying that some will think it's not real !!  your lost!
AD Dame Klay confirmed
This is going to be the best movie ever made
Wait a minute he need to assemble a elite team to get his son back. Could this be a hint he is signing a elite team to beat the Nets?
Lola doesn’t look as good in the original...
Idk how to really feel about this. It basically looks like Ready Player One part 2
Not bad I thought it was going to be worser than this!!
WB: Ready Player One with a basketball expansion pack...  Me: Throw me in the game coach  🏀🏃‍♂️
Most garage movie trailer ever!!!!
I'm VERY attracted to cartoon LeBron James. I'm not sure what to make of this fact.
I know this will probably suck but shut up and take my money.
Anyone Dope For Lola Bunny
I can see this being one of the best movies of the century or a total fucking disgrace to cartoons and cinema in general lmao. Guess I’ll have to watch it
Why does the robot look like FlightReacts tho?
Im just waiting to see an video where someone goes through this trailer in slow motion and pause at every frame to spot every reference.   Like, why tf is the Joker, scooby doo gang and the mystery van and all this in here.  Where's my man Big Chungus
I'm soo Blessed to be in the same ERAS of SPACE JAM of BASKETBALL GREATS; Michael Jordan & LeBron James.
Damn man..
They changed lola bunny so I won’t watch this movie🤓
Woke Jam. I'll pass.
This might be one of the first times I don’t want to go see a movie when it comes out,the first looks better
This is just Ready Player One: Basketball Edition
They will grow up to this we will always remember space jam 1
Thank God lebron Is Black
"Man,Will Smith DOSENT have to deal with this" Hahahaha🤣
No monstars ???
Hell no
Double Wide Surprise
#restorethesnyderverse
Not interested. I already watched Space Jam when it was original with MJ. I'm not gonna watch this one. Lebron comes and gets Pepe Le Pew fired and traded away the Looney Stars for Drummond, Davis, Wade to cheat and someone wins it for him. Right Ray Allen? Still Lebron gets the credit. Nahh hard pass.
LeBum james back at it smh
This ain’t too bad I would like to see steph or the beard players like that just like in the original they had Charles oakley
Michael Jordan
i was watching space jam just the other day XD
I like the original how Michael got pulled in the hole at the golf course this movie looks weird the whole elevator scene I don’t like the idea
THEY GOT KING KONG!?!?
Dang it took 25 years for a sequel well I’m definitely not complaining I hope this ends up good.
Want a sprite cranberry
Lebron: "What did you do to my son"  Cheadle: "I turned him into a tree"
You sure this isn't Ready Player One?
Why? Just.....why?
This is like ready player one with Warner bros. companies characters for this film
Ready Player One on One...
So not only did they redesign Lola, but they made a 3D model for her. Missed opportunity for hot 3D model. Very disappointed Warner bros. Let’s see if you can postpone it for a HOTTER design. If not then the internet will have to rate it 6/10.
Why didn’t they just get his actual son? Would’ve been a great acting debut.
Missed opportunity if there's no big chungus
Don Cheadle: Lebron pick your winning prize!  ✔5th Ring  ❌Son
Don't mind me. Just gonna drop this here: [#restorethesnyderverse]
1:26 Yes!!! They aloud guns back in a cartoon!!!
I am 100% sure that this movie will FLOP.
"What good is a Space Jam movie if I can't imagine myself banging the lady rabbit?" -Pathetic Neckbeard
They went astronomical on us
Not related or interesting but the movie is going to release the same date my birthday is, yay 😊😊
there is way too much going on visually. also, the old lady kicked the basketball which is illegal. finally, I saw that wink lola, buncha trolls XD
Get woke go broke
Warner Bros went full woke and said MORE DIVERSITY ( Aka only put non-white characters lol)
I been waiting for this momment
I got massive infinity war/endgame vibes here 1:39
DAMN
#bringbackthelooneytunes
Some serious trash
If this movie flop or get low negative reviews I will blame it on the the SJWS
wow it comes out on my birthday
Hope the movie does well in china👌🖕
1: Toon not tune. 2: Not Space but on a server. 3: Server jam not Space Jam. 4: Could have just played 2k instead of kidnapping a child and got the same results.5: Server crashes are a thing every modern gamer knows of and that would definitely be a thing here. 6: Don Cheadle controls everything in the simulation so he could just adjust sliders like Mike Wang. 7: EA or 2K is charging LeBron for each member of the Toon Squad. Open packs is how you get your team now.
they literally stole references from ready player 1 this looks terrible a jumbled mess of pop culture references looks god awful and stupid the original one was better a lot better
this is one of the worst looking movies I've ever seen
This is lit
No cap I’m gonna be honest LeBron James acting might be better than Michael Jordans Diss  me
Ready Player One final battle be like
Oh this looks good
I already hate it
and coming right before my birthday  Awesome!
Can't wait for Lola Bunny to get popular again. That way we can see more "Fanart" for her existence!
Now people going to be saying mj had to play against giants with bums borrowed basketball skills and lebron had tougher competition
Yosemite sam has his guns. Fuck yes
I better see at least one mortal kombat cameo
Lola Bunny no sexy
Fake ass Michael Jordan. Bro be your own man .
Esta pelicula se pone locaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Drible Drible Drible Drible🏀🏀🏀
Ready Player One Part 2
Pennywise at 0:51🤣 whyyy?
Avengers Endgame with parental controls on
SKIP BAYLESS: "Lebron needed Bugs Bunny to save his legacy!"😠
SLAM BAM WELCOME BACK TO THE JAM!
Yo ngl this movie looks 🔥
The GOAT
Pennywise, Morpheus, and Agent Smith at 1:46 A clockwork orange at 2:24 What kind of universe is this?
The GOT
Ready player Twenty-Three
Shoulda just made a second one with Jordan. would be way better...
Ready player Lebron
You know MJ Betting on the Monster Squad
So sick, looking forward to it
It's like a remake but better.
#restoretheSnyderVerse
GET READY TO JAM AGAIN 🏀
Noooooooooooooooo   Lolwut
Jszmic
Where’s Kyrie at?
Okay, I like it. It look pretty good.
1:18 when Warner Brothers, knows that SUPERMAN is very important and necessary. 🔥🦸‍♂️🏀🐰 #RestoreTheSnyderverse  #HenryCavillisSuperman
I hope that this movie is going to be good. The first one was a masterpiece in my eyes.
Chris Smoove bout to post a vid recapping this and starting it off by saying “LeGM is back at it again”
🎶Jump up to the top LeBron🎶
Marvel: most am Wb: *WELCOME TO THE SPACE JAAMMMMMMM
I’m.... im very worried for this
This Movie Will Literally Complete Me..
Imagine if the bad guy in this film was deltone west
Bruh we need the sexy bunny back
Trash
MJ was batter😅 and this is one of those movies that don’t need another movie too it
Holy shit that looks shit haha. “Quick quick throw some robots in there. TECH!!”
Bring back our Lola and we're good
Another thing we loved destroyed again...
Get this Illuminati shit out of here  We have no interest in supporting satanic worshipers !!!! GTFO!
Anybody notice the trailer was in like... 30 fps xD
LeBeijing James
“Ready Player...LEBRON!” 👍👍
So its Ready play one but with with lebron james. The level of dissatisfaction goes beyond verbal expression.
So he wasn't just flopping, he was practicing too.
Nothing hits like the original
Ralph Breaks the Internet: I contain the most easter eggs in a movie Ready Player One: You better give me the crown, because I just added some more Space Jam 2: Hold my omelet
the DUCK
they did lola bunny bad, petition to bring back the THICC
I don't know man, it looks like "flop" is in the title
So it’s just spy kids 3D
No please just no
Congrats on getting more views then Black Widow
Ready Player one is soooo gonna sue your ass...
I feel like a game of basketball with LeBron's picks for a basketball team would be way more interesting of a movie than with the Looney Tunes.
Elite team 'gandalf' on the list. Haha I'd love to see gandalf shooting hoops while Seal Fly Like an Eagle plays over the montage
Is this space jam 2 or ready player two? The hell is the scooby gang and king kong doing here?
Bruh how you gonna call the looney tunes rejects. Im offended........ill still watch it
lmao everyone wondering why Lola isn't sexualized anymore and then she's animatedly winking at the camera anyway. Seems kinda counterproductive XDD
I love how this is the number 1 on trending
RIP the OG Lola Bunny design
Ready Player And One
Yo Bronny time travelled
Man, I wasn't looking for a Ready Player One sequel but yet here we are lol
This is more like Ready Player One than Space Jam.
I didn't know you can score a point by kicking the ball in basketball 🤷‍♂️
Ready Space Jace Two or Space Jam: The Next Reference.
Space Jam isn't a great movie, but it has goofy charm. I hope this one doesn't take itself too seriously.
Are we sure this isn’t an April fools joke
They really said Super Smash Bros. WB
1:40 SOUND THE ALARM AND TELL RYAN
I’m calling it now! MJ will make a cameo in this movie!
people who sexualize any woman: NOOOO DONT DESEXUALIZE LOLA BUNNY warner bros: haha redesign go brr
The dislikes are from Bron haters lmfaoooo
LeBron is not even in the same locker room as Michael.
I'll watch on a DVD. 4k would do it good.
....uhhh......
Yeah nah...
💕🤗💕
This shit looks amazing
It's still space jam, but instead of outer space it's cyberspace
How much social justice crap will James bring to this movie? If it's anything like he brings to the NBA I smell a box office bomb.
LeChina is a hard pass
For some reason this makes me want a new Space Jam video game where you play as the Tune Squad and the Goon Squad because I feel like this could make an awesome game
This looks just stupid
Not feeling it.
I get strong slappy the squirrel vibes from the new lola look  😂
HM?
No
It’s a damn shame they are gonna tarnish a classic
Corny AF.   Steal a few more things from MJ, lebron.
Jordan looking g at this like............."if you don't like the way I acted... then don't act... . BREAK"
I want to knoe jordan reaction about this movie... It will be classic
Not a lebron fan or a hater but this shit looks fire as hell
amo
Wow this looks good, but still got my concerns.
Rotten Tomatos: 2% And the movie ain't even out yet. Critics: LeBron Haters and 90s NBA purists. "Shaq: I've got two of these LeBron!" (Referring to Blue Chips and Kazaam.
come on and RUN BABY, RUN.
HAPPY 25TH ANNIVERSARY!
The visuals finna go crazy in this movie
Most people say all sequels are bad, let's see if that's true here
This is fricken cool
Just noticed Mr. Freeze and Pennywise at 1:45?
1:00 the music actually sounds like it's from the old 40s cartoons
epic
I remember when it was Michael Jordan
LeBron wants to be MJ so bad lol 😂
Trying to modernize a classic movie will usually end up in disappointment and this trailer is evidence
Eu tô muito ansiosa para esse filme sair
CHILDHOOD RUINED
MJ better make a cameo in this.
wtf
DON FUCKING CHEADLE
Imagine if this was the last monsterverse movie
Sources are saying Lebron James is trading lola bunny bugs bunny and 4 1sts for Stephen Curry
Does this mean Don Cheadle sees whatever hentai I'm watching
Y E S
Ok cool, but where’s the old Lola design
Fake
wreck it james!!
Mj is better
0:35 Westeros Game of Thrones
tweety <3
*Why couldn’t lebrons real son play as he’s son I’ve seen him so much with him it feels off to see some other kid call him dad*
*Petition to make Lola Bunny a GIRL again*
People always love comparing people. But for me maybe MJ is a GOAT in his era, but because LeBron I love basketball I'm not a basketball player but I love watching basketball since MIAMI. Different people, different style, different era. But the important is who inspired you to love basketball, that player is the GOAT. I'm going to watch this movie❤️❤️
It's been 25 years since micheal jordan version I wonder he's comeback for this movie.
Announcer: "Welcome to the Space Jam!" Fred Flintstone: "Yabba Dabba Doo!!"
"So that's it, huh? We're some sort of Space Jam?"
Shit movie already
This look so dope!
amazing but why lola bunny aint THICC
A rogue AI kidnapped my son and I took that personally
My childhood is ruined. This looks horrible!!
Stiff and bad acting and lifeless voice acting. He should stick to basketball.
Lakers would lose their shit if anything like this happened to LeBron
Getting ready player one vibes from this
You all do realize that this is basically nothing more than a 2 hour commercial for HBOMAX, right?
2:10 Only basketball fans know
wow
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
I wish Kobe have a movie like this.
Lola bunny put on those covid lbs lol
This look way better than I thought it would
https://youtu.be/Z1sILVTl5HI
Lebron haters whiny and crying right now
Warner Brother’s “Ready Player One”...again
I want the original soundtrack out right now you feel me🎉🎉🎉
Random people: Advengers endgame is the best crossover ever.  Warner bros: Hold my beer
LeBron deserves an Oscar.
No
An MJ cameo would be epic!
LeGoat haters crying right now😂😂😂
Hmm
I can’t wait for the new space jam remix
When did Lola become D-Wade?
I hope Michael Jordan is in the bleachers watching this shit AWESOME 🤟🏼😂
Over the top CGI with that extra kind of money could have called the lengend Bill Murray.
Wow 6.7k dislikes must be a bunch of Lola bunny fans raging at the characters new design.
This looks awesome!
Havent half of the Looney tunes squad been cancelled already ?
Crying SJW ++: F**k the Tiny Toons.  WB: Ok, Clockwork Orange Assemble! 🤍🤣
What a joke.
Yo I was worried this is gonna be bad but it doesn’t look too bad and also I liked the D Wade lob to Lebron call back they did wit Lola Ight I’m kinda hyped
nothing beats the original.
This guy forsure scarified Kobe
Na. Not my Space Jam. Already looks like a massive failure. Smells like Michael Bay's Ninja Turtles.
NUMBER 1 TRENDING YEAH💞
so ready player one 2.0 lol
Looks really good and fun! Can't wait to see King James with Bugs, Daffy, King Kong,  The Flintstone, Captain Burnham and War Machine all in one place!
So no alien invasion, no world is at risk?? Just the Internet kipnapping his son for no reason at all and that's it?? that's why they will have to play "The Game of the Century"?? 🤷‍♂️ Shit, I really hope there's much more in the movie that the trailer didn't show... 🤷‍♂️
Ngl kobe would of been better
I love how badly Lebron wants to think hes better than Jordan so desperately that he even tries to be in the same movie franchise as him. Lebron has that little boy mentality.
Democrats you can have baseball, basketball, & football it's all yours 👍
Why is this even a thing. The last one at least had an entertaining plot, this looks plain dumb in my opinion
Ready Player Two looks better than the original
Not watching this cause of the whole Lola bunny thing
Ohhhh man I can't wait for this movie to drop
Scoob: tries to establish a Hanna Barbara Cinematic Universe.   *Fails Spectacularly*  Bugs and LeBron: *Fine. We’ll do it ourselves.*
Looks rubbish, it will not have the charm or the fun of the first one. It has to rely on other characters from different franchises and not just bugs and co to get a decent film going. We've already seen ready player one, looks like a massive rip off.
Someone at WB really wanted to make a Ready Player One sequel.
oh HELL YES
Love it! Cant wait ❤️
Stop making shitty remakes of old movies! Come up with something original
Can’t wait The animations are insane
Wife: You gotta win this game, and get our son back. Bron: *worried* Eighteen years man, eighteen years.
No other basketball players??
Trailer aside, what they did to Lola Bunny was just pure criminal...
soulless
Hope they have the monsterverse
If you pause on 1:46 you can see pennywise in the background
Guys if u look closely right B4 iron giant there was Scooby-Doo mystery machine
Lmao what the fuck
This lools like ready player one but with Warner Brother Characters
Jordan wannabe. This crap look awfull
This is what the world needs right now
Who’s the guy in the Planet of the Apes mask?
I think it's the cringiest trailer I've seen in my life.
Where butler and blake
Cp_dustbowl
Better graphics than jordan era hahahaha
Fuck they made Lola bunny ugly.
How's that for you, Elon Musk?🤣
I hope he win because he the main character
Can we talk about the bad guy designs for a moment? Those are some BADASS designs.
I wanna see La B flop in this movie 😆
They really nerfed Lola hard😔
This movie looks fucken terrible.
I was actually watching the first space jam on Friday and then Saturday there's a new one, on July 16th its my sis birthday
Looney Tunes Back in Action 2 looks Pretty Weird.
This feels very ready player one ish
I’m sooo hype I can’t wait too watch thiss...😭😭😭
Ready Player One: NBA version
I wonder why it had to be a secret that Zendaya is playing Lola’s voice? Doesn’t seem like it would have to be ‘shocking’ or whatever.  Well, this movie will eventually be fun to watch at home to pause so you can identify all the background cameos. With that in mind, I’m wondering why this had to be centered on the WB Looney Tunes characters to begin with? If the producers had access to have casual references to “all” Warner Bros. IP, then why not have this be more like Laff-A-Lympics? (I guess you would have to be Generation X to even remember that. I doubt that Gen Y folks do.) someone like Scooby Doo be a character on the basketball team? Grape Ape could be the center. Why not have Hong Kong Phooey in the mix? (then again, in him you had a black voiced [RIP Scatman Crothers], parody of martial artists.. cultural appropriation accusations? Hanna Barbera also produced The Chan Clan around the same time, oddly enough.]
Director: "How many of our IPs should we feature?"  Warner Bros: "Yes"
1:42 That's no ordinary dragon, that's Drogon from Game of thrones.  (Which I'm currently watching for the first time..)
LeBron don't come back to ohio
...he did tell him to shoot the ball
Fenomenal Warner Bros .
I wonder why they didn't do this with kobe
Sure bring out another classic to butcer. Why appreciate classics when you can just destroy them?
Hey stop wrting hate comments on this movie. I can't like them all...
Hell naw I’m not watching this with lebron  They really did MJ wrong
Should’ve left this film alone. It’s didn’t need a reboot.  And I’m a big fan bron. Sorry but this ain’t it. Maybe it’s cuz I’m not a kid anymore. But I’m not feeling this
Ready Player 2 out already? Seriously though CGing the Looney Tunes is pretty lame.
Ready Player JAM
Cool
Is that Drogon?
Noice
LeChina James.
Spotted: Pennywise from IT
Michael Jordan would be disappointed 😂😂
.k8o
This is gonna suck. I just know it.
I absolutely can’t wait for this movie!
More garbage movies for garbage generation .
thats gonna be one shitty ass movies inside a commercial
2:23 - Pepe isn't kid friendly anymore. But gang rapists are kosher.
Drogon lives! I see where he went
One word NOPE
Yo I was just thinking about space jam too
This new Lola looks weird.
This looks bad. Visuals look beautiful, but this does not look good. I grew up with the original.  This looks like someone watched 'Ready Player One' and was thought "... let's do Space Jam like this."
Straight to the trash can
It's all tunes, folks.
Why bronny look different tho?
Wont be better than original. probably box office wise it will
Looks weak as fuck.
The OG Monstars/Nerdlucks better cameo or I'll one-man riot
La coneja va estar tetona o no
U not mj lol
Where is Spongebob? Do kids know any of these cartoon characters
This acting will probably be hilarious
Space Jam: Enter the Warner-verse
This looks fucking stupid....i would bet 100$ pepe le pew is not in this film.....there is only one space jam.....and one star that's mickeal Jordan. This movie being made is disrespectful to his honor.
0.35 Game of Thrones
POV: You're looking for comments about Lola  Bunny
Nerfed Lola can't get any worse  Nerfed Lola:
I'm here for it!
Imma pretend that this is ready player one sequel
Oh Lebron just face it. You will never be like mike
Ye
Lola got a nerf
It feels like there's something missing
0:54 “Pete, send this clown to the rejects.” Does LeBron look like a clown to you?
28 year old me realizing that the first movie barely had any “space” in it lol
The bron jame
If the animaniacs are not in this movie, I'm crying
Even pennywise 👀 is in this movie
This is a black movie. I love it.
Dame with a clock on his shoulder 🔥  #DameTime
Everybody a gangsta until Lola Bunny pull up on the court
Is this ready player one or space jam lmao
Is Henry Cavill bouta have a cameo? 💀
leGM at his best
This is what a movie made by pie charts and focus group testing looks like.
1:58 Daffy's face.   HA!
Pls don’t end up like Tom and jerry movie
It's not the same with out the original characters from the original movie.😢😥
*YEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!*
GAVE ME CHILLS. LOOKS FUNNY
The frick is this monstrosity
when Africans think they from EU living in the US but they just from Africa !
Bugs bunny getting traded for thanos
LeBron, War Machine and Looney Tunes?
Nothing will replace the original
Lebron is the bow wow of the acting community
This would look like Ready player one 2
Get out of satan system and get in God system before its to late people claim they love God and want to heaven but lifestyle heart mind mouth lyrics and soul says satan and hell ⏳
Iron giant and kong better be playing in the Team.
This is if Wreck It Ralph 2 and Ready Player One had a child
Cant wait to see Ready Player Two 😂
Game of thrones in kids movie but not Tom and Jerry there
no.
#1 on trending
So basically this whole movie is because they got off on the wrong floor while taking an elevator?
It think may be better then the first one  it has some good story and some characters development but that what I think I haven't seen the movie
Bro I wonder how bronny feels that his dad ain't using him for the movie
Still won’t be better then the original but ig 🤷🏽‍♂️
Yalll messed this up already dangggg
Nah why this got 6.3K dislikes? This was fire
Is this a secret message that Lebron is enlisting the help of Looney Tunes characters to fight against the Nets
Honestly, if Pepe le Pew was in this, I would see this movie.
commie propaganda
3D Lola Bunny looks like shit
siccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccck! but please let black women have LONG HAIR.
Be nice to watch this  at age of 8.
So, Space Jam in name only, then.  RIP.
Any other characters y’all think we can expect in this? Anyone from Cartoon Network/Adult Swim or maybe Sesame Street? Perhaps John Oliver?
Am i the only one that thinks it’s not all that 😕 so much time talked about it and years out into it and to me the story plot seems ehhh so far hopefully it’s better when it comes out 😔
Oh my god...this was so more corny than I hoped
No
The robot is lillard The bird is AD
what happend to kobe bryant???
This is trash 🗑😕
Damn, Ready player one 2 looks great!
This is an RL Grime appreciation post.
They better fix Lola bunny!
I feel like it will be way funnier with Lebron
Yay
LeBron needs to stop trying to be like Jordan 😴 he's too old for that now
This is gonna be the BEST movie ever
This is looking cool
https://youtu.be/H9C4sANvH8E
y'all Klay Thompson in FLAMES?! 💯🔥
I saw The trailer on TV
Yo Let's Go LBJ!
This just looks like a Tune of FUN😲💯🏀
Garbage movie from a garbage man ruining the legacy of the greatest black basketball  player ever Michael  Jordan   give it up LeBron you will never be anything on his level  Go roll your ankle again and cry some more
Thx LeBron
Not gonna lie this looks really great lol
2:23 Is that scooby doo
🐐⭐️
Prácticamente Warner está haciendo con esta producción todo lo que Marvel no ha hecho en más de 20 películas xd
So this is ready player one two along with space jam
6 words , IM GOING TO SEE THAT MOVIE❤️😭😭
Holy shet
oh boy I can’t wait for Marvin the Martian to get cancelled by my fucking sensitive ass generation for gun violence
Trailer was meh
This looks woke stupid 😂
This is an argument in defense of Pepe Le Pew. I'm very liberal and progressive, but I don't believe we should be canceling him. In the episode Little Beau Pepe 1952, he notices Penelope the Cat has fallen asleep next to him. So he wanders away and sprays himself with a million bottles of perfume. As she wakes up, she instantly falls in love with Pepe, now that he smells wonderful. This means, that the love is mutual, but he literally just smells bad lmfao. That's the whole joke, Pepe le PEW. Also, she becomes as crazy as he is, starts chasing and kissing him furiously, so then he runs away. He even says, "Why is it that whenever a man is captured by a woman, all he wish to do is get away?" I'm just putting this out their because cancel culture has come for a literal CARTOON character. I liked him as a kid, and I still find the skits funny. Don't hate on me y'all.
Love  space jam .90s😊😊 Hate the space jam. 2021 🖕🤬🤬💔😭😭👎🖕🖕🖕🖕
Y'all are releasing my favorite childhood movie on my birthday?!!!🎂🥂🥺😭🥰🤘🏼😃
This is either gonna be a complete abomination of a movie or this is gonna be amazing
I don't know how to feel about this
*bronny smoking weed in the background*
Lebron can no longer win another ring in real life so he recruited a different group and went to another dimension and eventually won his 5th ring. The legend of the Ring Chaser, bow.
Loved the OG space Jam as a kid.
Smh Bron always tryna build a super team around him bc he’s too scared to win by himself MJ would never
I have watched 20 seconds of this and it looks fukn dumb as shit.
I love Space Jam.
Ok I thought this was going to be pretty cool but then I saw The Iron Giant and the Flintstones. This is going to be lit asf 🔥🔥🔥🔥.
*I'M LOVE IS TRAILER!!! 😍💖*
This looks fucking sick
This new generation kill all the movies and styles.  Ending 2021.
Was that fast dribbling robot Dame lillard?
War machine yessssss
Wanna’ a Sprite Cranberry?
This isn't related but avocado toast is really yummy.
We Need Kong..... the Court needs him
Megan Fox in Justice League movies
Meh
I really hope Lebron can act. Because he is essentially carryinf this whole movie
😭😭😭💔💔 not part 2. Is one reboot.. Shit Warner bros.
LeBron James is an amazing basketball player, but a very stupid person
All I can say is 😂😂😂
this looks like dogshit
just scrolling down to see all the hate from the toned down lola bunny
Tho only thing I wonder is 1:09 how did he know to blow on his thumb?
Did I see the animaniaces in there?
This reboot  .not part.2 Fuck shit  Warner bros. And Disney.
Where pepe le pew?
Injuried = movie(s)
Not worth it after they changed Lola's thighs SMH.... my childhood is ruined 😪
https://youtu.be/2531rzN4zag
This trailer makes me appreciate lebron's Hairline
Doesn't make sense, I think there is basketball involved?
_
And mj took it personally.
Hey Warner please do MK v DC game and MK v KI. Means Mortal Kombat vs Killer Instinct. Be big and good for numbers.
#ReleaseTheNanceCut
Shit Warner bros.  Shit  Disney  ...
If Lebron doesn't come back to Earth on a spaceship with R. Kelly's "I Believe I Can Fly" at the end, we riot...
#NotMyLola
Bro iron the giant .

So... I’m realizing... we are just THREE MONTHS out from this one and they are only now starting to market it. Although... Godzilla Vs Kong got about the same amount of forewarning, if not less. Actually, I don’t think we have to worry.
Go Porky 🌊🐷💪🏻 Perú 2021 - 2026  #RestoreTheSnyderverse
Ready player tunes    Looks awesome!
Are you sure this is not ready player one 2
Where are the other four NBA top players who got stolen their basketball gifted?????????
😭😭😭😭😭💔💔🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🤬🤬🤬2021.
I wonder if Lebron James going to turn into a frog.... or pigeon....or ghost....
What if the leader is old Jordan
LeBron haters are so weird, more obsessed with LeBron than his fans lmao they prob didn't even watch the trailer and just came to dislike
1:41 drogon ?
I'd give anything to see Pepe macking on Don Cheadle at the end. "Oh je t'aime, Cheadle. Let moi be your little Rhodey, n'est pas? Muah-muah-muah!"
The original all the  generation . The Ending  . 💔💔💔😭😭👎👎🖕🖕🖕🖕2021.
Uhhhhh
Was most certainly not expecting the movie to look like this! 😁
1:38 YO IT’S THE MYSTERY MACHINE!
C'MON AND SLAM
MJ never needed a jump boost for his dunk😂😂😂
It would be a big surprise to me if they manage to add live action Sonic The Hedgehog as a guest Star.
That gold robot looks like Damian Lillard
The Flintstones!😱
Me when I saw that they didn't do hand drawn looney tunes for the entire movie: :( Me when I saw the iron giant: :'D
Any chance cgi artist can put iron giant into a movie, you bet ur ass they are gonna do it.
Lebron might as well higher them as his barber
this is literally endgame
This is ¨READY PLAYER ONE¨
Is it just me or does the robot at the end look like D Lillard
This has no style at all, its so gaudy and just, ugh...
1:54     The coom squad
Please let Jordan cameo
This is Gonna be LIT 🔥
Wade should be here to save his so-kid too.
Hope the movie tanks.
Wow... This looks terrible. Looks like they tried way too hard
LeBron staring in Space Jam 2! it was about time 2021.
Wait... didn't Wade and LeBron did that exact same alley loop? 2:10
‘Bron lookin for Dom through Don
Lesgoooo
This looks pretty terrible, cringe
This is literally the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen
Lebron basket ball camps next week  Son it’s not a FaZe das I want to be a pro gamer
I have many feelings about this, and they're all negative.
Oh my the Just dance sound was nostalgic
Why the hell did they take a page out of tron
Holy crap I’m excited
Where’s Pepé Le Pew??? 🦨🦨🦨
I da know about this. Not a big fan of LeBron James.
Ready Player One has joined the chat
They know what they are doing with lola
All the hater gonna hate and still watch it 🐐🐐🐐
Don Cheadle let’s go boy
2:10 If thats not a reference to top all references
We finally have a Space Jam movie where the lead actor can emote
*Remember what they took from us*
how to overengineer fun:
Looks about as entertaining as the current NBA.  There is only one King and his name is Jesus.
This looks kinda bad. Way too many things are going on, it's over-blown, and looks like it's just shoehorning things into the story for the sake of it, also the Original Space Jam while yes it was an hour-long commercial, the story at least made sense, and everything was simple and sweet. The sequel looks like they're desperately trying to overhype everything, and make it bigger than it needs to be, and that sets up for the film to be really bad. Let's hope I'm wrong.  Also the fact that Pepe Le Pew wasn't in the film, but characters from a Clockwerk Orange are is disturbing. Accordingly, Kath Soucie isn't Lola Bunny which is super disappointing.
😐
Wow This Looks Like Shit
That actually looks really cool!!!
Wheres pepe le pew....
This trailer literally revealed everything about the movie.
⁦ಥ‿ಥ⁩wt
Lebron ah 🐐
Why didn’t the use Kobe instea-
2:23 it’s the Scooby Gang
RIP Pepe Le Pew
Compared to MJ, this is weak.
Absolutamente basura
Space Jam 2 just turned into a Ready Player One prequel and I am 100% for it omg
Boycott this garbage,  cutting Pepe out was a stupid thing to do.
ឭ
1:46 pennywise starin’ doe... 😳
Why are the droogs from clockwork orange here? They’re like straight up rapists. And they wouldn’t allow the cartoon skunk who supposedly wants to rape a cat? Idk whatever, these fucking trillion dollar companies do what they want.
#Restorethesnyderverse
Warner bros is shining finally outshining Disney this past few months with Snyder cut, sucide squad, the Batman, mortal combat, Kong v Godzilla, and now this
Bro at 1:28 if you look at the ducks bill. The bullet hole just appears out of no where. I hope that’s just a fluke and the movie isn’t as lazy as that.
I want MJ
ESPAÑOL ALGUIEN????
who'd want to watch this after what lebron did to the NBA with his woke nonsense?
Producer: How many Easter Eggs? Warner: Yes!!
OMG 😍😍😍
remember what they took from you
Wack
I hope Kobe in someway or form comes out in this movie. It doesn’t even have show his face just a shot of Lebron looking at something just when it looks like his team is about to lose, the crowd looks in aw, a figure out of nowhere shows up and says to Lebron “JOB FINISHED?,...I DON’T THINK SO.”
They did bronny dirty😭😭
It's Ready Player One all over again,I'm already excited 😆
Just another way LeBron is TRYING to out do MJ. I love LeBron,  but no way in hell is he better than Jordan. This movie looks dumb as fuck
Guys i think they were welcoming us to the space jam or idk😨😪
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that warner bro’s legally claimed bugs bunny to be a struggling rapist by copyrighting meatcanyons wabbit season.
Finally a remake or sequel that actually looks decent
This looks like shit. I will just pretend that Lebron is dead and that this does not exist. Lebron is already a piece of shit I don't need the sequel to be shit as well and oh look it already looks like shit.
Lebron James is not the king.... he is far from it. Would’ve been a whole lot better if MJ took his place.
You can't kick the ball. Trash.
Nothing is better than the first
Is it a super team in the movie  cause lebron cant win alone
GARBAGE
Did no one realize Anthony Davis is the bird
Cliche and corny. So am supposed to like this movie cause basketball? We are in 2021 the biggest city in the USA that rivals new York city. Austin, tx don't got a a major sport team. People don't care about sports no more. So this movie missed the memo. Sorry who the athlete in the movie is. We don't care about you. Choose another career your 15 mins are up. Thank you, next
Space jam 2: the quest for more 💰
Off brand Bryce James
That’s it I’m done. I thought it was fan made, but if this where they’re really going with this. They completely ruined it and really don’t know which direction to go with. A complete mess
We all know that they’re gonna get Godzilla on their team. He’s still got some moves from Charles Barkley!
Did they try to do ready player one?
This is more proof that lebron is a jordan wannabe.
#restorethesynderverse
Welcome Back To The Space Jam!!!🛸
nope. Not watching it. Lebron tainted the NBA with social justice BS. and this movie will clearly fail to be good like the first space jam.
Even A Clockwork Orange characters are in this
Is Disney going to loan you Thanos so you can snap half this movie out of existence? It seems like there’s too much going on.
This movie, and Wreck it Ralph 2 are the equivalent of "Look at How Much we Own: The Movie"
DID ANYONE ELSE SPOT PENNYWISE!!!!
Multiverse the most popular trend right now.
1:06 lmao that’s hilarious 😆
Well that looks awful
“Let’s just everybody go”
Don cheadle being the overlord of their universe is perfect
So it’s just basically Looney Tunes was RTX on
Cartoon Bron look more like Lamarcus Aldridge
Pause and go to 1:43. Look down, this shit is cursed af.
2:09 Lola with the D Wade No-Look Lob to Lebron
Lebum for the Oscar
When the little blue guy pulls the lever, you can read: Hogwarts(Harrypotter Bedrock(Flintstones) Westeris (Game of Thrones) Themyscira(Wonderwoman) Neptune(idk just neptune) Saturn(issa plannet) Thundera (thundercats) Mars(Is another planet) Mercury(A planet) Emerald City(Wizard of oz) and Albuquerque (no idea) Just a fun fact :)
Man this looks horrible
Hey everyone! WELCOME TO THE SPACE JAM!
i like how nobody is mentioning that the lego batman movie did this before ready player one
Where's Osmosis Jones and Drix?
It's ready player one, but basketball
Trash
Soooo this is basically ready player one of Warner Bro properties??
not interested. lebron helped ruined the NBA with woke SJW crap. I won't watch any movie that involves him.
Godzilla should be on Lebron's team and Kong needs to be on the Goon Squad
Wooooow ! I will wait it ! Thank you so much 😊 😍😍👍
Me: Huh. Never seen this big of a crossover before.  Some People: *Cough* Ready Player One.
Soooo, Pepe Le Pew it's a no go but the guys from Clockwork Orange are okay for a family friendly movie.
So we’re not going to talk about how King Kong is appearing in two movies this year
welcome to the space jam 2:19
That bron - d wade moment was iconic
unbigs your chungus
That’s when my birthday happens July 16th
Lovely Carl Stalling music cameo at 0:59. Nice touch. 👍
That’s fucking disgusting.. Everybody wanted to be like mike. America it begins.. RIP Space Jam
Please dear God don't let this be like Pixels
...That's a kick ball, lady...
LeBron can't do a between the legs dunk, fake
Of the original song isn’t there, I’m gonna rage
Ah yes Iron Giant. Never has any input to the story. Just there.
The Monstars better make a cameo 😤😤😤
In the words of Angry Joe "YOU DONE FUCKED IT UP"  This literally looks like a live action remake of Wreck it Ralph 2 and Ready Player One.  But at least the "stealing Instagram Followers" isn't actually true yet.
The Bron James
Lola Bunny’s back, instantly sold!
this looks like a mess is too much going on for the movie. straight garbage
I feel like bron haters is just gon hate on this movie just bc bron in it
*_SPACE JAMES*_*
Honestly it does hit the same as the OG did
Queen James 🤦‍♂️😷 I guess 2021 can get worse with the new president
Bad guys don't really look bad, they just look like 5 random X-Men lol
They just made another Ready Player One?!
OK IT ACTUALLY LOOKS GOOD I’M IN
Is it set in the Ready Player One Universe?
Yo war machine in this movie
Game of Thrones Wizard of Oz
Here comes Ready Played One comparison and people complaining that Lola isn’t sexy anymore.
When they mentioned this years ago I wasn’t for it because I felt like Bron had more to prove before they forced a follow up, but now that he’s won a chip with The Lakers during a historic year I would say this is the proper time and by the looks of it seems worth the wait...
That acting is, well ... Something else lol
Jordan fans be like “See how can Lebron be the GOAT if he can’t even act!”
What in "The Matrix" hell? *_Morpheus has joined the chat_*
Thats not Lebrons son or wife
Well we don't all have to like it( imo it's trash sorry)
BRUH, on everything but my life, I thought monstars was gonna play, even though they are friendly back then
Ruined Lola Bunny.
Regular space jam looks so much better
I'm just happy to see Iron Giant in this trailer.
shallow plot.. hahaha..
3 words...buckets of nut🔥🔥🔥
Just why?
Before Don Cheadle says Lebron has to win a basketball game in order to get his son back, he better show the son and say “Boom! You lookin’ for this?”
Pennywise is in the background
Lola bunny has changed for the worse
I just want to comment I’m here at 2.6 million views April 3, 2021 7:45. If this makes history we’re here to see it
Trash. That’s all there is to it.
1:38, da Scooby van😏
Wow lebron got his hair line back
"WOW" this is going to be a cringe fest...
.
you can never get over ... your majesty MJ
1:46 if you stop right there u can see Pennywise (bouns flying monkey)
Where Kobe at?
This, this will be shit.
Looks like a Ready Player One sequel lol
Inutile andare a vederlo al cinema o in tv, ormai il trailer è il film stesso, troppe scene, !!
What is this this is nothing close to the  Michael one
Yeah that’s going to be a No from me dawg
I loved Granny going badass at the end! No Monstars though, huh? When I was little, I honestly had a crush on Blanko, the tall dopey looking one.
That Lola Bunny reference to Dwayne Wade was slick lol
Definitely seems like watching
1996: Michael Jordan  2021: Lebron James
DAMN this looks awesome omg. I'm excited but I feel like their hyping up basketball too much lol. It feels so weird that they have to win a basketball game just to get James' son back, idk. I haven't seen the first Space Jam movie in forever so I don't remember it that well. But I'm super excited for this!! Idc what everyone else thinks, this is AWESOME
1:45 First Gidzilla then the Looney Tunes? Ol' King Kong's sure got his hands full this year.
I wonder if any of the looney tunes ever injected that “secret stuff” directly into their arms like Lebron did.
Everyone is Here!
1:18 that team would of been elite😂
Now all we want is a sequel to Who Framed Roger Rabbit!
Yes sirrr the kinggggg is backkkkkkkkk 👑
It looks good movie cant wait
SOOO  a child is abducted but that's ok because we have so many Easter eggs!
A sequel 25 years in the making!
Looks better than the one Michael Jordan was in way better than the first one
Honestly, I'm impressed
Wasn’t the first one shit?
Something something Lola bunny tiddy
All the dislikes are people still mad about Lola Bunny
This is a WHOLE CROSSOVER 😱😱😱😱
This movie looks bad
Damn that CGI Look Good but like I said for the original space jam. HORRIBLE IDEA.!!!!
Hearing the lyrics from the original Space Jam song is giving me heavy nostalgia. I'll be ready to slam and jam come July 16th!
Just from the cameos I was able to spot...:  The Flinstones, The Jetsons, Peter Potamus, Cheetara from Thundercats, Magilla Gorilla, Drogon, King Kong, The Clockwork Orange Gang, Joker and Penguin ( Adam West Batman ), Mister Freeze ( Arnold Schwarzeneggar iteration ), Dorothy and a Flying Monkey, Inspector Gadget, Space Ghost, Pennywise the Dancing Clown, The Mask, The Wicked Witch of the West, The Herculoids ( Igoo as well as Gloop and Gleep ), Scooby-Doo and the Mystery Gang, Frankenstein Jr. ( from Frankenstein Jr and the Impossibles ), Jabberjaw, Yogi Bear and Boo Boo, Penelope Pitstop, The Iron Giant and last but not least Jack Nicholson's Joker and Danny Devito's Penguin.
Ok at first I was like this shii is whack but as it went on it got way better
Looks amazing 🔥
Uggg this is vary bad
I remember when everyone was hating on this lol
Avengers  assemble.
Visually impressive...but everything else is a huge mehhhhhhh
As a movie reboot, this doesn't actually look bad😯
Space jam: ready player one
I thought Warner Brothers already did a Ready Player 1 movie... Weird
Ruined
B bb
At least King Flop can’t ruin Like Mike 2. Mike will always be the GOAT
Most ambitious crossover since Ready, Player One and Avengers....combined.
WTF
EWWWWWW
Labron please don't do anymore movies. Do it in China.
I'm conflicted.  I grew up with the og space jam and had the soundtrack CD and everything (first full length CD I ever bought.  First CD was Missing you single with Puff Daddy, 4tay and Faith Hill. Anyone remember those things?)  I was sure it was gonna  be a horrid retelling,  but this Shit looks wild and....  Well original to space jam lore.  I'm thinking it might be decent.
Wow
This is aboutta be interesting
YESSSSSSSSS
Needs more Bill Murray
Proof LeChoke is an abusive father
This is insane
Dumb af and lebron "queen" james will never be as great as Jordan. Only thing he is king at is flopping. He flops better than most soccer players.
BIG CHUNGUS!!!
OMG THIS IS GONNA BE A SICK MOVIE
No one talking about Lola recreating dwade and lebrons legendary picture
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO POG CHAMP MAN
This movie going to be ass lmao
**Here lies - Lola bunnies bonkers**  **rip**
Ok I'm pretty sure I just saw Agent Smith, Morpheus, Mr. Freeze, and Pennywise all standing around Matrix Rhodey with a Grandmaster attitude
Michael Jordan cameo in SJ2?
This looks so bad 😂
E
So it's pretty much Ready Player One with basketball? Yeah, still skeptical. I still haven't forgiven them taking Pepe Le Pew out of the movie complete with an introduction scene that actually sounded GOOD!!! Then again, Warner Bros rarely ever make good decisions with their movie franchises. Edit:RIP June Foray, Granny's OG voice actor
@Ready Player One
Movie looks corny AF!! They tried it though.
🤢🤮
1:39 Look it’s the mystery machine so that means Scooby-Doo will probably be in the movie 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
This can only be really bad or really good. Let’s just hope for the best but I’m still skeptical
I have to be dead honest....looks Terrible lol
I’m having a lot of feelings right now...
"Welcome to the *Serververse"*   ...Why didn't you just call it the "Serverse"?
I hope lebron brought some of his comedic stints like from train wreck.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ngl... Not a Bron hate,but cmon... Put a lot of those acting classes to use bron 😂
This looks like garbage
This looks so hyppeeeee
1:42 Drogon from Game of Thrones
This looks extremely well done. I remember being on the set of this at warner bros. Coolest thing ever seeing. Can’t wait to watch
So it looks like Don Cheadle went from saving the MCU as War Machine to challenging LeBron James and the Looney Tunes to the Space Jam basketball match as Al-G Rhythm.
This is gonna be awful
This Movie looks like it's going to be freaking ridiculous and insanely fun to watch.  I'm honestly excited to see this!!!!!
i like the premise of the move in all but i just really don't like how lebron james come off as a fake actor to me. Its as if he reading a script. It doesn't feel like his comfortable being in that role. like him talking to his son, or him saying "what in the matrix hell" or him falling to the toon universe even him just being surprise in all it just doesn't feel authentic.
Lol now i know why there calling it reddy player leBron
I Love Lebron, But doing a Space Jam 2 just solidified that MJ will hold the crown as the Best. Because this just doesn't look to be that good nor close to better then the original. I promise I love LBJ & MJ, but I hope the movie is good.
A random person approved of this video
Looks like trash
Looks good  I was against this movie but lebron fin to come thru
HISTORY RIGHT HERE
lola bunny ugly af now
Wtf is this?😂
It’s pretty funny that Lebron’s horrible acting shows itself even in the trailer.
Hmm... I saw a lot of references to the original, which makes me wary that this will just be a rehash of the original, flashier, but with less substance. We shall see how this turns out; I hope it ends up being good
Y’all should try to guess what nba player goes to what character 👇
Alright the grandma breakdancing sold me.
Even in the movies, Lebron has to face way better competition than Jordan 😂😂
1:33
Dumb
Why is no one talking about the RL Grime Scylla mix 🔥🔥🔥
2:25 you go granny
Graphical meas No iconic theme, just remix of original Weak selection of NBA stars. Soniqua Martin-Green - Destroyer of Star Trek Toons become horrid 3DPD Sequel wasn't needed.  Pass
Ayyoooo finally!!!
Tron 3 ?????
Theyre actually fucking make them
Your references have a little bit of SJ's trailer
Look bro it player one 2
This looks awesome
Come on and SLAM !!!! Hopefully the classic song will return in the movie
I gotta see this shit high 💀
0:35 game of thrones
Space Jam: Ready Cartoon 1
HOLY ****! OH MY ******* GOD
Looks fye ngl
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Might as well pick Patrick Beverly for the role. Cheaper. Same quality.
does it feel like they kinda showed almost the whole movie in this trailer?
Wow, Unacceptable!!! Clockwork Orange at 2:23 you sick MFer's
Can’t wait for the scene where Lebron trades away his entire team!
Looks so fucking bad
Not gonna lie. I think they nailed the direction of this film. Unfortunately trailers don't represent the movie's execution, but I'm confident that this'll be worth it
Holy shit this looks bad.
no cap this looks trash af
I've watched space jam 10 times I'm ready for this movie 😭
##restorethesnyderverse
No. Just no.
LMFAO THIS GONNA BE AWFUL I CANT WAIT 😭😭😭
LeBalding always making super teams 🤡
This is just a worse version of Ready Player One. If there's no Gundam, I'm NOT interested.
#restorethesnyderverse una
The toon squad is the same team as the 2016 Cavaliers
All who disliked wear Jordans
#restorethesnyderverse
When you see that lola bunny doesn’t look like the way you have hoped:  impossible, perhaps the archives are incomplete
#restorethesnyderverse
#restorethesnyderverse

No my worst fears are confirmed first paramount made sonic into a furry and now the Looney Tunes has the world gone mad
#restorethesnyderverse
Why is it filmed like a Nike commercial

#restorethesnyderverse
#restorethesnyderverse
🤔 only one question I got ask will Michael Jordan make an appearance?
#restorethesnyderverse
#restorethesnyderverse
This just looks like Ready Player One 2
Space Jam breaks the internet.
We need more crossover movies with other universes
#restorethesnyderverse
The decorous policeman intriguinly print because spruce internally measure on a statuesque scanner. many, electric joseph
More like Space Jam: Into the Warner-Verse
Warner Bros might not be great at DC movies but my god do they nail space jams
But is it part of the Snyderverse?
Finally a sequel of Lola Bunny
Warmachine literally the creator of space jam
ALL THEIR 3D MODELS ARE JUST SPOT ON!!!! AND AH THE IRON GIANT ONE IS AWESOME
basically rpthis movie ... makes him the new GOAT ...
I cant wait for this i saw alot of easter eggs
Lola with the Wade Signature pass to Bron 😤
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Kudos to Warner Bros. Pictures!  Space Jam: A New Legacy first trailer is NUMBER ONE ON TRENDING!!!!!!!
Wait what? This does not look even close to the first
Just remember what they took from us
How nice of the creators to give Lebron a hairline
Wtf did I just watch. They always ruining stuff
WELCOME BACK TO THE JAM
Lebron should have done this movie years ago
I guess I've just watched the whole movie, thank you trailer for saving me $50
Maybe they'll make a directors cut where they kneel before the game and China turns out to be the hero
1:17-1:20 Damn bron was trying to win like 6 more rings
Please don’t suck, please don’t suck, please just don’t suck!
Everyone want to be like Mike
Ready Player Two is looking nice
He’s like 35 doin this movie man
Did anyone else see the D Wade reference at 2:08
il be jamming on the way the movie theaters ;/ Am i right ;)
teachnogly for the tv show children basketball
The power of Warner Brothers character rights made this looks like Ready Player 2.
No... no...no....
Wholesome movie. Gotta win a basketball match to get your kidnapped kid back.  WTF?!?!?!?!?!  Also, do kids these days even know about the Looney Tunes cartoons anymore? Seems irrelevant for todays generation.
wb: how many characters do you want? space jam: EVERRRYONE
An anticipated spectacle among 2021.   I’m extremely excited. Someone high-five me. Please? Anyone?
God it makes me so happy to see 2-D animation
This is the generation of crossovers and alternate realities.
I would totally do Lola bunny lol
To me it doesn't look like it will hold up to the orginal space jam but i could be wrong have to wait and see
https://youtu.be/LLfNPTPzYrU
This is like the oasis from “Ready Player One”
This looks trash
That goon squad though 😬, all that to beat a 36 year old?
2018 Ralph breaks the internet  2021 LeBron breaks the internet
I Hope disney & their Ilk Go BROKE.
Lola is looking amazing as ever. Cause unlike fake fans, I love her anyway she is. But I'm pissed off you chose washed up bitch Zendaya to voice her like WTF!!!!! Get bent for that Warner!
Couldn't you have given this an original name instead of leaning on the popularity and nostaligia of a very different movie?
wait they didn’t take away his guns??  LETS GOOOOO INTERNET
It will be space james??🔥
This looks AWFUL
I cannot take this movie seriously 😂😂😂
I’m never going to be able to cancel my HBOMax subscription
Oh hell na 😂
This shit was garbage the only part that was funny was when Yosemite Sam (the white cowboy with guns) shot the basketball
Lola bunny tho. SHEEEEEE
Knowing Lebron... I'm sure Xi Jinping has a cameo
Shut up & dribble LeBron
Cwassic!
So Lebron got injured on the first ten minutes to keep tradition.
I'm here for Grandma
Is that his real son???the youngest 1???
Maybe I’m the only one, but this looks like a hot mess.
But Does It Have Chungus
I been wait for long time for this
Was ISIS in charge of casting for this movie? Why the FUCK is Don Cheadle the villain? Thanks HBO Max, you just lost a subscriber, right after I see Mortal Kombat. Don't fuck that up, at the very least.
Compared to the original, this blows. Aside from the Looney Tunes
Bro I cringed 2:10
Cringe compilations will be had from this movie for sure
NOPE! If LeBron James is in it, I don't watch it period! If Kobe were the main guy, totally would! But I won't show support for that racist coward!
Never in a million years did I think they’d make another Space Jam.   I ain’t even mad.
so they explained why the changed lola and removed the skunk....so yeah i'll still watch this
This movie is coming out on my birthday.
Don’t quit your day job, LeBron.
AH SHIT... HERE WE GO AGAIN!!
This is the whole movie right here. No need to go see it now lol
bruh🤣
Okay I'll admit this looks great but I'm still mad about Pepe le Pew being removed.
Who else noticed game of thrones in it??
Wow, the visuals are stunning
Ready Player 23
It looks like if it has some elements from Ready Player One.
Dunno man looks tryhard
Ready Player *James
Pls stop making sequels to classic movies
Lebrons kids in the movie probably see him more than his own
I can’t stop watching.
Bronny getting high somewhere watching this laughing his ass off
This is why lebron missing most of his nba game due to injury lol.
Man if only I could watch this with  a better athlete🧐
Lucky he didn't land on Westeros.
Cool, looking forward to seeing Pepe Le Pew 🦡 😊
nah this ain’t bad
What does lebron kids think of another kid calling him dad
Sorry, they had every opportunity to cast Natalie Dormer as Lola Bunny and they dropped the ball, I cannot support this.
that aint my lola
I seen King Kong on 1:45
Looks kinda sick ngl
So make sure to have shrooms for July 16.  ✅
Is it me or Lola bunny looking kinda flat this time in the movie it isn’t even her
Where rabbit boob?!?!?!?

Ready Player One?
Can we get a cameo from Michael Jordan
Lest go Lakers!!!
Dave Chappell need to be in this
still gonna be fire
no thanks
This looks like ready player one 2: this time it’s basketball.
Trash
FINALLY!
This looks terrible...
Ayye man idc what anyone says this looks like it’ll be a good time!!😂😂😂 I’m watching it 😂
Hii
Why not make it while kobe's still there.
SHEEEEEEEEEEESHHHH🔥🔥🔥🧊🧊🧊🥶
Ehhh I don’t know, good thing I get it free on HBO max.
Why isn't his 8yr old son taller than him? This isn't realistic otherwise
It's kinda crazy that a simple one shot movie from 1999 is still getting cameos and references today. Do kids even know who Iron Giant is? Do they still rerun that movie on CN?
So LeBron is playing himself, yet other people are playing his family? I’m confused.
🙎🏾‍♂️Just throw the whole Goddamn NBA away😒
Meep meep
I'm so excited
They did Lola wrong.
They could have titled it FLOOR JAM..
Can we all agree that a team with the Iron Giant and King Kong in it would be virtually impossible to score on
I swear I hope theres a Michael Jordan cameo in this
Already gonna call it that lebron isn't going to take the game winning shot OR he's gonna take the game winning shot  but miss. *note jordan scored the game winning shot with 5 guys defending him. Lebron would never*
I like seeing WB releasing all their other IPs into this, I mean Drogon!
I’m honestly excited for this
King Kong can't catch a break can he
THE MASK BETTER BE IN THIS
Best movie ever hands down
welp lola bunny sucks now
This is another nostalgia wank fest like Ready Player One, it looks bad.
Was it worth the pay check Don
Not sure what the whole Lola Bunny controversy was about. Her old design was definitely too sexualized for a kid’s movie, this new design goes more with the kid aesthetic. The 90s was a weird time with plenty of over-sexualized cartoon characters
Nope. ✌🏾
This is what you call a trailer!!
Jones from fortnite should be in here
Isn't it Toons? I don't get the spelling of Tune used in this context....
I'll gonna pirate it, I'll not pay for a movie with a censored Pepe Le Pew and an ugly Lola.
What if JaVale McGee is the main actor here? 🤔
YES😂! Thank you 😊 lol
After Tony’s death, Rhodey became God in grief.
Ready Player One remake?
God Warner brothers pleased.... Make Lola Hot AGAIN!
This looks dumb as hell
Nice to see Lola in a PROPER basketball jersey this time.

Stream King James now by Anderson paak if you see this comment  👑
Ok so Drogon is here....
Movie Studio: "How many IPS do you want in this movie?" Producers: Yes.
War Machine been busy after Endgame 🙃
LeGM back at it
Hell nah
Kong just did a double feature this year. What timeline is this
Anybody crying right now due to nostalgia?
#restorethesnyderverse
Mj should do a cameo appearance for us. The old school guys 🤭
Fyeeeeee
Lola bunny even tho she diff I still would hit that the wink made it better
SHeesh
If you are reading this and you are sad and/or depressed know that Jesus Christ brings deep happiness and fulfillment. No amount of alcohol, drugs, or sex can bring as much happiness as Jesus can. Invite Him into your heart and be born again. Read the New Testament in the Bible and meditate on the scriptures. The joy won’t come immediately but once it comes it’ll flow like a river. It always comes as long as you don’t give up in seeking God. Weeping and sorrow may come at night but joy comes in the morning. God bless.
Just because it’s Lebron James I’m not watching
nice but... #restorethesnyderverse
Eh, What's Up, Doc?
Shit look stupid. They shoulda left it where it was. Lebrun can’t act for SHIT. I’ll take the original wit Michael anyday
Love Space Jam but James lookes 🌽 ey as fuck
I LOVED the original when I was a kid!
Uh, Ready Player One: Basketball Edition anyone?
this looks so good
I think I saw a few fortnite references in there.
My Reaction To The Trailer! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-RrffH8fM4&t=2s
You: (scared cause you never ate grandma's cookies) Grandma: 2:24
2:10  Lola to the haters 👌  Also, a Nice reference for Lebron's fans 👌
I’m so down for a kingdom hearts movie now... yoooooo that would be insane
This is crazy
Looks so corny
Haha Lola's face I guess the memes aged well too well she looks like a pile of spit XD
thunder cats top right corner though at 2:23
COMPUTERS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY
SPIRIT POWER   Judges 16:20 Sampson’s mother wove her son’s hair into 7 locks – much like JZ (Queen Bee’s man). As JZ explains it – whenever he is working on music/ recording an album, he normally doesn’t cut his hair. So I guess the next album is getting really bad. (lol). Kent Freewill Baptist Church News & Views publication theorizes that since in Revelation 5:6 JESUS is described as having 7 horns representing the 7 fold Spirit of GOD, Sampson’s 7 locks represented HOLY SPIRIT’s power. Can we lose HOLY SPIRIT’s power? Delilah shaved Samson’s hair and JESUS warns us to hold tight onto Him. Invite HOLY SPIRIT in to stay today!
Bro LeBron James sucks ####
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Nahhh
Crazy how most people remember wade to Lebron as a no look love her wade looked away but it was a backwards bounce pass
Ready player jam
YESSSSSS I NEEDED THIS IN MY LIFE
But Jordan ain't dead *sigh*
https://youtu.be/ngLnpU6iQ6k
Stephen Curry better be in it
Bronny must’ve felt disrespected...
Make an iron giant 2 WB
What In "The Matrix" Hell?
Is it me or this modern cgi made the toons look worst than the 90s?
Fix lola
This is going to be epic just like the original.
“Give me back my son!” “Ok.”  The end
Du
Im getting sick of Hollywood at this point honestly. Always want to remake something and the shit the remake or reboot be straight up ass. Stick to playing ball and being more like you Lebron then chasing Jordans ghost. #Jodandagoat #originaltoonsquadplease
The fact that the animation looks this real is still surprising 👀
Damn this looks better than the first one
Let's hope it's not as bad as the first one lol
I want this to be bad but i still know its going to make a lot of money
What coat was he wearing in the beginning I want that
PROMOTE SYNERGY! (Like a boss...)
#restorethesnyderverse  🛐
0:19 What the fuck is he doing in the GTA 5 server farm?
zendaya as lola  chefs kiss*
Where is Jordan????
Oh no looks like I might have a crush on robot man
Ok the thing about the first one that was really appealing was putting cartoons in the real world and equally having real life Micheal Jordan in a world full of cartoons which is still hilarious to me to this day and they were like "FUCK ALL THAT MAKE LEBRON LOOK LIKE HE STARRING IN THE PROUD FAMILY REMAKE"
Lebron Is The Goat Of Basketball Can’t Wait Looks Better Than The First One Already!😅👊🏽🙌🏽🐐🔥🎯
it was a good attempt. not good enough
Sequel= Ready Player One & Tron 2
I hate when Trailers showcase too much, None the less im still gonna ebjoy this, Allveit not nearly as much as the much more simple original
mid
bruh this sucks, why do we have to ruin good things
Space Jam 1996❤️. Space Jam 2021💕💞💓💗💕💞💓💗💓💕❤️💜❤️💛💚💚💞🤍💕🤍🤍💘🤎💕💕💕💓💕🤎💕❤️💛💚💚💔
Yesssssssss
wut
🔥🔥🔥🔥🌋🔥🔥🔥🔥
is that damian lillard in the end??
I thought I already saw Ready Player One...
Now we just need Pepe Le pew and Lola bunny with her old costume 😂😂😂😂
I thought this was Space Jam not Ready Player 3
This trailer reminded me of two things:  Ready Player One and Animaniacs.
Trash
OMG I HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE. I saw the flintstones, yogi bear, the mystery machine and other cartoons
This real look good i really can see the the upgrade from the first movie
Thanx for ruining another classic! Did you sign LeBrons son for the third one yet, or is that all female cast?
https://youtu.be/DWtV2m3_1GI
LOLA IS TRASSHHHHH, SHES NOT THICC LIKE WE WANT
Damn I’m tryna go to Westeros and stop the events in season 8 from happening
This shit look fire 😂😂💯🔥
The first one was the first dvd i bought.... i feel old and hyped !!!
Furries going crazy for 3d lola
The second I saw animated Lebron I was like "this an L"
This has absolute 0 vibe of the original
Why is there cg animation? That shouldn't be in the movie
Ready Player Jam
Movie theater vibes
Actually dog water
If you liked this video your probably in the 8-14 age group lmao
Childhood memories 😭
I see kong I see the movie
space jam: ready player tron
Feels like Ready Player 1 to me.
Honestly the difference from the first movie is LEGIT
I had some reservations about this but that disappeared at 0:34
I hope Yosemite doesn't get cancelled for gun violence
Lebron is such a bad actor
Trying to steal 23 and do same movie as him, will never be MJ regardless what this guy imitates.
That’s whY James moved to LA to makE a MoviE maKeS senCe Now.
This movie looks so amazing
Dam if Kobe was a live...he would be on this. RIP
We need kong.the worlds needs him KSKSJDJDJD
Looks like poop
Bill Murray better show up and save the day again.
Ouch
This looks fantastic holy what was the budget
ready player 2 lookin good
i dont care about movies but that looked pretty EPIC
Oh, I’m ready for this one
EVERYONE IN THE WARNER BROS UNIVERSE IS HERE!
Kong about to have 2 losses back to back
Where the hell is Jessica Rabbit?
Is this a reboot or a sequel?
Even in the Space Jam universe he still be LeGM
Lmaoooo Superman, Gandalf and Iron Giant? That would be a dope team but he really only needs Bill Murray and Newman.
Nothing will beat the first space jame movie with MJ
WHAT'S UP DOCC
Can’t wait for the movie!
And so King James becomes a movie star
well this looks dumb
Cringe, cringe, cringe, I wish I could un-see that, quick let watch the trailer with MJ in it
Likely made in 2017
Where is Speedy Gonzalez?
Meh
Desexualize Lola Bunny? Nah fam
OMG THIS LOOKS AMAZING IT LOOKS SO SIMILAR TO READY PLAYER ONE X THE LOONEY TUNES 😍🤩 I'm hyped for Space jam 2 defiently looks amazing and so many cameo appearences so far. I'm glad Yosemite Sam has his Guns
Holy crap that release movie is gonna be crazy considering Black Widow and Space Jam 2 are coming out within a week of eachother
The visual effects are insane. The animation is great too. Hope this movie don’t suck. It would be a waste of production.
What a complete waste of time, how dare you try to remake the classic space jam with this piece of garbage. Remakes ain’t shit but Money grubbing
Yo this come out on my birthday
Hahaha damn what did I just see? 😅 and Lebron's acting is.. oh man lol I hope everyone that sees this has a good time though🤙
Y'all see how lebum needs all these cartoon carectors to win a game even kong is on here why bother making this movie anyways
Tf is this
mj better make at least a cameo
bro this is actually way hype
The GOAT BABY !!! LEBRON IS THE BEST THAT WILL EVER BE ! CANT WAIT TO WATCH THIS !
DAY FUCKING ONE WE THERE
Ready Player Two
It's a pass for me
Lola bunny isnt hot anymore..
I am more than hyped.
Weak bone
Can’t wait to see this hot garbage in the $1 bins at the $.99 cent stores a year from now
Micheal Jordan watched this trailer and was like my luny toon  team would win and I took this personal
Looks good 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Trash 🗑
I see LeBron went and joined another Super Team to get a win.
This triggered my PTSD from the Ready Player One movie 😨
Okay, I'll be the first to admit. Maybe we did overreact to the lola bunny redesign, she doesnt look as bad as we thought.
We need Kong. The LeBron needs him.
The hawk dude is Anthony Davis(uni brow), Metal dude is westbrook or lillard and the watery dude is steph curry for sure(splash brother). can Anyone make out the others?
I mean this looks very nice to look at, but there's too much going on. Like why are there so many different characters being shown, trying way too hard. We don't need a multiverse for what should've just been the Looneytoons characters.
*looney toons: back in action*
Looks like they have captured some of the magic from the original😍😍😍😍
Wack ass corny ass movie
Welcome to the SPACE
Is Lebron’s movie son based off of Bryce, his real son? He looks exactly like him.
OH MY GOD, did Lola Bunny just wink at me? Na-ha, that's too sexy, let's erase her eyes.
*sees Lola Bunny* Look how they massacred my boy
My son is gonna love this,it's a shame that we haven't any Cinema's open in Ireland.Hes moving to America in 2022.Dont what I'm gonna do when he gone 😭😭😭
I don't watch basketball even though my city has a NBA team, but this seems interesting.
I can’t wait to see it space jam a new legacy
Michael Jordan lives rent free in Lebron's head.... And it's fantasic
This looks like trash
Warner Brothers after seeing Wreck it Ralph 2: “Ok, my turn”
2:09 nice
sucks already
No Pepe, no watch
Easy call. Kickball.
Cant wait 🔥🔥
You know China's heavily invested in a movie when you see a bunch of bots promoting it.
Looks pretty terrible
Warner Bros. Presents: _Everything We Own: The Movie_
I still haven’t forgiven you WB for what you did to Lola.
WarnerMedia pretty much have the largest cartoon library. More than just WarnerMedia owns Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies, but also Hanna-Barbera, pre-1991 Ruby-Spears, post-1974 Rankin/Bass, the former MGM cartoons likes Tom & Jerry, DC Comics and the Cartoon Network and Adult Swim original shows. Warner Bros. is a giant in the cartoon business.
Fk Lebron and his shitty movie.  MJ and Space Jam 1 are better
If they don’t have Bill Murray in this one I’ll riot
All these years...All the anticipation...for such a lackluster trailer. Smh
Our home boy 'The Iron Giant' makes his return 💓
1:45: Is that Pennywise, Mr. Freeze, a flying Monkey, and Baby Jane Hudson???  I would have never expected in a million years to see a Baby Jane Hudson cameo from Whatever Happened to Baby Jane.  I know it was a 1962 Bette Davis Warner Bros. flick, but it is SUCH a random cameo.
Hopefully LeMickey really would win a real ring this time
So you basically took 90s Space Jam and just transfer it to 2020 technology. Is this MJ approved??
Old lola looked better
Ngl I immediately thought of Ready Player One when they showed the Iron Giant in the middle of that crowd
Pepé Le Pew somewhere punching the air rn smh 🤦🏾‍♂️

who's ready for the new wave of slam jam mashups
The multitude of characters heading to a basketball game is giving me some vibes from the Circle of Life opening scene from The Lion King!
The fact there is a new SpaceJam makes me feel so old. It is like hearing about newer Pokemon. Like, really Steve, there are more than 151?
Trash
I'm surprised Yosemite Sam aka the Cowboy isn't cancelled yet cause his guns 😂
"When I saw LeBron try to create a better Space Jam then me I took it personal" - Michael Jordan
Wait is it me or did she just reference dwade  when he did the exact same thing after throwing the lob to bron
Is the water or fire supposed to be Klay Thompson? Either way these mfs is a lot scarier 😳
Looks like straight to DVD type of movie
damn the visuals clean af
Space Jam: The Oasis
Been waiting for this movie forever. Shit bout to be LITTTTTT AF!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is going to be Universal and so Legendary my God YEESSS!! I WANT TO SEE THE MASK! HE MUST BE OUT THERE JAJAJA 😭💀
Pepe Le Pew is at home mad right now that he didn't get an invite to the party.
Shii I had goosebumps watching this, it brought back so many memories
Где Джордан
Can’t wait!!!!
That iron giant and Kong were ripped straight out of ready player one. I could tell right away
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Oh God please have the cartoon James only be like a 20 minute interim or something that was terrible! It’s a really simple formula, just do a montage in the middle and play Seal’s Fly Like An Eagle and I’ll give you my money Warner Bros.!
This looks so good BROOOOOO
I'm gonna take a wild guess on the identity of the ruler of the server-verse is James' son in the future.
Hmm.. riiiiight.
THE MYSTERY MACHINE
I thought Biden was the biggest joke in 2021 but its this movie for sure. YUCK.
I love this, they start flockin Flow Flow Flow Flow
Okay but why is Lola flat 😔
Lil pump i'monna future i'm gonna shoot SwiftKey SwiftKey SwiftKey SwiftKey SwiftKey
I'm 37 years old and I'm pretty excited to watch this with my kids. Its like reliving my youth with them. Pretty cool.
This is going to be lit.
............ 👎🏽
Let's play some Basketball 🏀
🖕 this movie and lebron James and 🖕 BLM
My dad will be the first in line for this movie 100%
This one is gonna be way better than the original one 😂😂😂
Meanwhile Bronny James is smoking a blunt while his dad is in space 😂
1:06-1:10 So if I go to Looney Tune Land...THAT'LL happen to me?😳...AWESOME!!!😆😆😆😆😆
Kind of disappointed there is no Bill Murray, but I guess you can't put all the good stuff in the trailer.
I like what I'm seeing man💯💯
#restorethesnyderverse
1:44 Look guys! It’s Boo Boo! The inventor of the whip and nae nae.
Just like the Ghostbusters remake NOBODY IS GONNA WATCH THIS MOVIE
Is this ready player one movie or space jam.... if so they should renamed this movie ready player one , a sequel 2.
Lola bunny the source of the furry plague.
8
A movie that actually looks promising unlike other remasters
Ready Player Two
1:07 - I feel like Lebron shouldn't have instinctually known to blow on his thumb to inflate his legs back up.  He's literally just arrived in their world, is disoriented, and has never been a cartoon before.  It would make more internal sense if they allowed him to freak out for a few minutes and then have one of the Looney Tunes give him the tip.  Him knowing the physics of being a cartoon right away flies in the face of the ending of the original where Michael Jordan had to reach inside himself to make his arm stretch like a cartoon's after playing as a human all game with some guidance from his cartoon teammates.
So this is why theres gonna be a Loony Toons LEGO cmf...
This looks like Ready Player Two, not Space Jam 2
Don?
Trash
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Nope....
This looks amazing!
The Worlds Biggest Crossover know to media
It ain't that bad actually.
So what's the budget? Warner Bros: Yes
🗑
Bro.. if I saw this when I was 10yds.. I would of had a stroke
This looks incredibly stupid lol
After watching some of his games i really though lebron would be a much better actor then this
Thats so sad that they had to downgrade Lola lol
Bruh this is just stupid. Like come on. This is just a stupid money making movie no one wanted.
GOAT
Glad I copped my sneakers last year!!! 😌
Ready Player One Jam looks ehhhh
now Lebron James As a actor good...
Them jerseys are sick as fuck I want one
WELCOME TO THE SPACE JAM!!!!
We need more movies like this, I don't care if it is only for money, I care that it is only for the fun of it.
rip lola bunny's chest 1996-2021
Chewie....We’re Home
Bron trying everything he can to get Mike's approval but Mike only cared about Kobe.
finally a Ready Player One sequel
Wheres Jordan, Barkley, Muggsy Bogues!?
I never had a doubt Lebron could act. All that flopping and crying he does on the court most definitely will translate to film.
ok so its ready player one part 2
Can’t touch that album. Had to suck off it because this looks so bad. Not saving it
Ready player space jam
Jordan better have SOME type of Cameo in this movie
Some Movies just don't need to be recreated
Lebron JR better come out with the smoke
Y’all know Jordan took that personally right?
I mean OK that's cool are you going to have lebron ride everything behind Jordan..I'll stick with the original movie!! Lebron is a copycat
I bet Jordan will appear some part of the movie
1:11 That’s it! That’s what I’ve been waiting for!!!
Well it won’t be as good as the first one but lebrons in it so that’s good enough for me 😂
It's cool movie better than original movie 1996,Ralph breaks the internet, Ready player one and Endgame
I ready  to jam for assemble
low-key trash 🗑️
I think is the most beautiful thing I see today...
Lebron
@2:14... just like real life... nobody touches him and he falls down 🤣🤣🤣
I'm taking a knee on this one.
I am going to like this movie I love the first one. But the story line is on point
It’s not Soace Jam without Pepé Le Pew ahahaha 😂😂😂 🦨
Bronny feeling real weird watching this trailer
This looks so dumb but so ungodly fun
Remember what they took from you
I for one am offended that yosemite Sam has guns, as guns offend me, therefore i will not be watching this film AS WELL as putting out 3 tweets calling for it to be cancelled  -some woke dumbass probably
They gave Yosemite and Elmer their guns back! Lmao
looks more like Ready Player One
This makes me thirstier for another TRON sequel.
WOW!!! I'M PART OF HISTORY NOW.
RL Grime anyone?
I’m excited.
Won't be as good as the original not even close.
Yoooo Granny be schmoovin'
I'll be jamming it in space then. I love granny.
Wait till Bronny finds out Lebron has a favourite son.
Wokeness 👎
Oh, Dear Magic Conch Shell will this movie be legendary?  Magic Conch Shell: Yes
If Nintendo ever wants to make a successful Smash Bros Multiverse happen, they better start taking notes.
Interesting
Вратарь Галактики вытащит это дерьмишко!
gg
😲😯
WHERES BUG CHUNGUS
Looks like Warner Bros deleting s n y d e r c u t comments.
Is that Dame at the end? Lmfao
I guess they wanna make kids not straight anymore cause the reason I'm probably straight today is because of Lola bunny I didn't understand why she looked like that but  back then when I was young my mind already knew what that was as instinctively so maybe that's why I'm straight today making her look like junk with nothing is just ruining it for everyone and every kid that's gonna grow up to be a man
If Michael Jordan doesn’t have at least a cameo in this I’m gonna be pissed.
Don Cheadle Word of the day?
I get it, Lebron isn't an actor, but they couldn't even make his performance look good in the trailer! There is no chance this will be better when its 2hrs long.
This is sickkkkkkk
This looks so stupid
Will Michael Jordan return?
This movie is gonna be terrible, but that won’t stop me from watching the hell out of it
Trash
It's only one michael jordan be original
Is that animated Lebron or Lemarcus Aldridge
Is god hand
Weeeeeaaaaakkk
Average Lola enjoyers have been waiting for this.
🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢
Yikes. Only thing good about this trailer was the RL Grime track featured.
It looks too futuristic I don’t think it’s going to be anything compared to the og
2:23 no FUCKIN WAY THE DUDES FROM CLOCKWORK ORANGE R WATCHING BUGGS BUNNY DO DUNKS FUCKIN WHAT TIMELINE WE LIVING IN😂🤣😂
This shit looks ass smh
The most expensive promo for HBO max sign ups yet
I'm so exited for this movie
WOW! Feel soooo unoriginal and boring.😪 Plus with my boy Speedy Gonzales out, this ain't nothing but sell-out movie.
Woah, I thought it would be cringe but this looks great and interesting.
The nerf on Lola is ridiculous this is why she gets little screen time in this cause she is not pretty anymore unlike Judy hops who Is now the preferred bunny
Avengers endgame but it’s basketball
Fortnite and space jam
I can't wait to watch this! looks soooo legit! rock on!
OMFG what a shity thing to do...
Wow,not only he a terrible person,but just as terrible as an actor.Jordan now thats Class
Looks good cant wait too see it
Very excited, though the premise of the movie is quite generic I think this would be a smash hit . I hope the training scenes will be different this time and it’s also good they didn’t show our villains of the story yet
He do movies now?
This some matrix sheet??
Daffy: Sam, Shoot the ball.  Sam: *So anyway I started blasting*
I wonder if this’ll be shit too
"Lookin like a double wide surprise " Bugs bunny
2:22 As someone who do this on field, IT LOOKS CLEAN AF
I need this in 4K
Bronny looking different
Porky Pig is the 🐐
Yikes this is pretty much a soft reboot . That's messed up
"GUYS ITS HAPPENING, EVERYBODY STAY CALM, ITS HAPPENING."
2:23 Alex from a clockwork orange is in this movie?
didn’t expect an animated lebron james but okay
🔥🔥🔥
I think this really happened to basketball starz.
it would've been cool if they brought out Michael Jordan as the final boss
the ''king'' deserves to be in this movie I've been waiting for this
Is anybody else getting ready player one vibes?
Seriously why can’t just have the main character look realistic and nothing else
Nope the original is still my jam. Here we go again Hollywood trying to spoil classics for profit.
WHERES THE CONJURING 3 TRAILER
Rhodwy front e
Don’t forget the cameos weren’t even in the trailer.... Kyrie, Klay, AD and Dame 🤯 this is gonna be legendary
Hit the jam...
Guns in a carton, it’s 2021…. Cancelled
If you haven’t realized yet at 1:46 pennywise is in the far right for a moment
Wait a minute, I just realized how similar an element of this movie is to Sponge Out Of Water. They both have their normally 2D characters turn into CG characters near the third act of their movies. There's also how those scenes are probably going to take up most of the marketing.
Lmfao elmer fudd looks like caruso
Okay 0:33-0:39 made me think of Kingdom Hearts
Ayo that’s war machine not iron patriot don’t confuse them and the movie looks pretty good
Idk what all the hubub was about lola still looks pretty hot
Bring back Bunny Boobs
My childhood is officially dead... RIP
@1:26 thank God they took away Elmer's gun
2:33 So, this movie is gonna have a bit of the ol' ultra-violence?
LeBron is the GOAT！！！
Lebron grew all his hair back no more bald spot 😂
Space Jam 3: Disney vs Warner Bros 😂
S/O to Warner Bros for recreating that Lebron Dwade moment 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Another like.. tom & Jerry 🤮
THIS MOVIES IS GONNA BE F@#$ING POGCHAMP, SCRUE GODZILLA VS KONG THIS IS THE MOVIE WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR
Looks good to watch. Here's hoping it comes out in theaters in my area.
Ready player one:space jam edition
Again
🦨??
Nope.
Looks kinda bad
Horrendous acting
2:09 little nod to d-wade...i love it.
Don cheadle after Brons son is taken:  “Boom you lookin’ for this?”
Movie Studio: "How many IPs do you want in this movie?" Producers: "All of them."
Everything one could ask for Lebroonytoons with a classic “whats up doc james”
"King" James! It was probably in the contract, they refer to him as "king" 😂 hollywood and "king" james, reject them!
I don’t know Lebron as an actor, but based on his exclamation at 1:07 I have a feeling it won’t be good.
This so quirky and corny I can't
WHOEVER IS READING THIS,GOD HAS A PLAN , JUST TRUST THE PROCESS 💚💚💚💚
Okay, so after Lego Batman and Ready Player One, this is the *third* Warner Bros. movie in which different Warner Bros. franchises make plot-related cameos, even Disney only did it once so far (Wreck-It Ralph)
Realistic looney tunes 😱😱
Ooooh weee, I can't wait!😁 Miss seeing LeBron in person! Saw him at a high school basketball league in Vegas!🎉
WHY does the Insignia of the Server-Verse look exactly like the WARNER BROS. LOGO?!?!?!?!
This is about to be legendary!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ready Player Space Jam.
It is not possible I could care less about this
Yosmite Sam still have his guns.. looks like cancel culture forget about that huh
A, On 2:10 Like The Wink Of Lola Bunny, But I Don't Want To Be Disrespectful of Her 1st Design. But I Prefer the Linkartoon Design Better, But, Hey, She's Officially My Favorite Looney Tune Character.  and B.- *IT'S LIKE READY PLAYER ONE ALL OVER AGAIN, BUT WITH LEBRON JAMES, AND THE LOONEY TUNES!!*
HOLYYYYY 😱😳🤯🥵 Goat James killed this one 🔥🔥🔥
Are they sure they want Lola winking at the camera at 2:10? After all, we don’t want people to sexualize her again.
We bout to see prime Big Chungus in action
Where's the golf hole
That wade - bron alley up reference! epic!
Marvel fans when Disney don work out :::  Ready player 1 vibes broooo always got som cringy salty shit to say lmaoooo
I’m pretty sure this is just Ready Number One with just Basketball, LeBron James, and only Warner Bros. characters.
This shit gone be good 🎉
He wants to be like mike so bad he had to be in this movie
He tries so hard to be like Jordan. 😆
I’m so happy I get to see an Iron Giant 2 🥺 never thought this day would come. He was blown up to pieces the last time we saw him and that one screw rolled all the way back to him
THIS SHII LOOK GOOD!
Hey isn’t that mystery machine from Scoob!
Lola did that Wade pass to Lebron I see you 🥴
I dunno if I will like this as much as the classic but it looks diverse. I would give it a shot.
Bro who knew Lebron was a good actor
Oh, Ready player one 2 is coming out?
Alright, I’m interested.
Being as the first one was a classic and all I’m definitely giving bron a try this looks dope
This actually looks pretty cool
Fun Fact: first time I went to the movies was for Space Jam  Bonus Fact: it was also the first time being in the AC...you know what happened
“Nothing can beat 'Ready Player One' for how much easter eggs they crammed in their film.” Warner Brothers: Hold my drink.
OH HELL NO!!!! Pepe le Pew gets canceled because people think he's a rapist! Yet the movie  features an entire gang of actual rapist in the movie? WTF!?!?!
2:23 A Clockwork Orange in the back
DID I JUST SEE GAME OF THRONES (THE PLANET) 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 ????
I agree still hopefully it has the spirit of the original ready player one did take this route (formula) and it’s successful with a sequel on the way confirmed by Ernest cline, Spielberg Olivia Cooke,chances of success are looking high still can’t wait for SJ2
I’m so hyped for this movie. I love space jam!
Sooo, space has it's own Jam right now?
i can already tell Bron's acting is gonna be ass
Dang! What I hate about this trailer they messed up Lola Bunny's cartoon and 2D character design... Ugly to be honest 😓
If only it wasn't Lebum James 😭
2:22 A Clockwork Orange
Warner Bros using all their IPs like
INFANCEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!
By the looks of the trailer, there is: Looney Tunes- Obviously :| Game of Thrones- Westeros Wizard of Oz- Emerald City Some DC: Themyscira, Gotham, Hogwarts Neptune + Mars +Mercury+ Saturn - Don't know what that's from (Entertainment/cartoon-wise ) Hanna Barbera- Orbit City, Bedrock, plus seeing a lot of them at  1:41 ThunderCats- Thundera And apparently Albuquerque for some reason.
I’ll pass, y’all took away my hot ass rabbit
#ChillsandGooseBumps
Nice
lebald is badly animated and the premise and story look... well, not much fun...
Actually very surprised of how good it looks
Nappa: What do the scouter say about their nostalgic level?  Vegeta: *Its Over 9000!!!*
I don’t care if it’s fan service, *this looks better than the first*
Oh God Lebron really can't act.
What's the point tho
So, 4 years later and Warner Bros. is already remaking Ready Player One.
Warner Bros, you're hypocrites!   You delete Pepe le Pew (allegedly he's a raper) but you made a cameo of Alex from "Clockwork Orange".  Shame on you, WB!   Double standards are so double)
LAME
We have Ready Player One at home! Ready Player One at home:
Let hope they do a Kobe moment
Also please Jordan rolls up in parzival (wade watts) back to the future delorean from ready player one in this movie
This gone be goated dawgg
Michael Jordan better make a cameo in Space jam 2
This looks like he got game meets ready player one
This movie would be great if they didnt nerfed lola bunny and get rid of 2 characters
OG AND GENERIC.
"What in the matrix hell" 😂😂
Garbage
I hope wade watts and the high five from ready player one be in here
Ayy put this back at number 1 on trending
This is so sweet I hope the babies love it as much as we did the original 👏🏾👏🏾
The new “ready player one” movie looking good
Hhmmm awkward its like they took the movie pixels and add it to the movie
Nope
Jesus. It's like Ready Player One basketball version.
Why was Lola bunny always good at basketball. She was the only character that had any sauce before they drank that super water
Teaching kids horrible grammar isn’t a good thing
Funny Idea that should happen in this movie. Cartoon Network is owned by Warner so I'm hoping Ben 10 makes a cameo, transforms into Four Arms, and uses him to challenge Lebron to a 1-on-1 match. It be badass if Lebron just jumped over him and dunk the ball.
Seems like a lot, yet something's missing...
This movie looks good, whether you love LeBron or hate him.
Iron giant live action please WB still can’t wait too see SJ2
Tax looks so cute in real life
Ready Player Matrix
Lots of familiar faces I saw  1. Iron Giant 2. Kong 3. Scoob! 4. Small Foot  6. Yogi Bear
Good on them for staying true to the original, this looks like dog shit too
Wow, this will be a leftist propaganda masterpiece
I guarantee you Lebron will win his last championship with his son on his team...he will go 6-6 in the finals. Story book ending for his scripted career
Rip lola bunny😥
this looks like shit!
Man this looks radd
Can we talk about how this is nothing like the first one it the animation looksgood but I don’t like the way the story looks
How many times do we have to resurrect the fucking iron giant just make a new movie please I’m begging you
I was looking for a Magilla Gorilla cameo
A crossover to surpass metal gear
Pre-Order your LeBron Space Jams Shoes....
Petition for better Lola
lemicky
Please have Jordan roll up in wade watts BTTF delorean from ready player one
1:39 "By the way, have we mentioned how much IP Warner Brothers owns? That's worth a cool $4 billion, wouldn't you say, Disney?"
🔥🔥
🔥
Imagine if they put MJ as an announcer
Nope, not watching something with "I am now Star Trek hear me bitch" and Mr "I love communism so f*ck the police."
Kids
Ready player one
The GOAT King James finally has his own movie 👑
2:10 you know they did it for the fans
1:39 So after seeing the Iron Giant in Ready Player One and now this, can we get a proper sequel?
Wait no Micheal Jordan?
Not gonna lie I'm pretty hyped this looks wayyyy better than I thought it would, props to LeBron 🏀
Im sure this movie will be fine but im really not happy that the monsters wont be in it. And that its a virtual world. Where as in the original it was all real. I guess this is a reboot not a sequel. Il still give it a shot
needs more peppe lepew
Please have Jordan roll up In parzival (wade watts) delorean from ready player one
This is unnecessary incredible Please talk about it more
Can't Wait For This Upcoming Movie 🎥
I thought lebron was the goat but now i can see it’s clearly Jordan.
This is the "Everyone is Here" of cartoon films!
1:43 dang I remember yogi bear and boo boo
Can't wait
They cant just leave things alone.
Lebron been actin’ for awhile now. I heard he got an Oscar for ‘Best Flop’
This movie looks fucking sick
*we just watched half the movie just now. Trailers gotta chill!*
*READY PLAYER 23*
Almost got a stroke watching this trailer
2021 really be cracked  with all these moveis coming
Weak
This.....it just looks awful. This isn't Space Jam. This is Warner's Bros Basketball, featuring every character in the Warner Bros roster. Or basically, Warner Bros' Rip off of Ready Player One but also the only way they could come up with an idea for a sequel to Space Jam.  Hard Pass
Well if ready player one can pull off a successful play space jam 2 possibly could pull off a successful play
Can’t wait to see Kobi Simmons, Isaac Bonga, Tacko Fall, Jared Dudley, and LiAngelo Ball play against Lebron
Aye aslong kong got that axe we be straight
my brain for past hour trying to figure out where i recognize the music
This is like the 2020s version of roger rabbit
I’ll say it now I’m glad I saw the first one because this one... eh it’s seems more like a cash grab to be honest with you but that’s just my opinion
OH YAY SPACE JAM ARE BACK!!!! 🏀
This Like If Space Jam 1 had a baby with Lego Batman and Ready Player One...(which also had king king and Iron Giant) and a splash of spongebob
Omg Iron Giant <3
I guess EVERYTHING is canon now.   🤷‍♂️
So this be where the Night King is chillin after gettin killed off 2:23
Did they delete all the dislikes ?!?
2:25 no one can out beat granny
I got chills down my spine watching this, Holy Crap
Worthlessness
What in the multiverse? s this the start of something bigger than just Space Jam 2?
This looks gear and LeBron is legit funny and decent at acting.
This looks so shitty and dumb I guess I have to watch it
Lola bunny got so ugly :(
Did you see Godzilla in the background
1:42 is that one of the dragons from game of thrones..
No chance I am watching a moview with Labron James in it.
1:46 Bruh, they even got Pennywise 😂
Ready player one space jam yes
Wow
Can we just have a good Space Jam movie with a ball player that can act?
When you think "avengers endgame" and "Muppet family Christmas" had best crossover in television and movie history...  Warner bros.. "hang on a minute"
0:04 Marvin the Martian 0:35 Game of Thrones 0:37 Wizard of Oz 0:55 Hogwarts, Themyscira, Bedrock, Thundera etc 1:16 Maltese Falcon 1:17 Gotham and Metropolis 1:18 Superman, Gandalf, King Kong, Iron Giant names 1:39 Scooby Doo and Iron Giant 1:42 Game of Thrones dragon 1:43 Hanna Barbera cartoons 1:44 King Kong 1:46 Villains in background 2:00 Casablanca 2:07 Both Penguins and The Mask on left. Warner water tower on right. 2:31 Robin on right
Hopefully we get to see some Cartoon Network characters in here
I now want a whole movie with the team LeBron James wrote down. With Henry Cavill,  Ian McKellen and Vin Diesel playing their respective characters of course.
With the success of ready player one and confirmed sequel by earnest cline and Spielberg google space jam most likely be a hit space jam going RPO I can’t wait too see
Ahhhhh......The 1st one will always be better 🥱🥱🥱 fuck this shiii no capp
Lebron has to recruit Superman, King Kong! MJ basically defeated the by himself! 😆
That kid's not Bronny!
Ready Player Jam
Looks cool. Also looks like they’re trying way too hard/taking themselves too seriously
IS THAT SCYLLA BACKING THIS? RL FUCKING GRIIIIIIIMEEEEEEEEE
This fire
Lebron James one-upping Michael Jordan in bad acting.
Lola Bunny's not thicc anymore 😥
give lola her fit back the fuck ? its not that serious
This looks so good.   I'm definitely going to watch it!
Space jam still holds up!! (well, all except that R. Kelly moment 🤷🏻‍♀️)
2:07 what’s he doing with them?
They better play forever by drake
This looks really shitty. James couldnt carry Jordans posing pouch 😒
very impressed
I love this film 😍🎥
I'll be skipping this one
Jesus christ create a new idea
So we’re not gonna talk about the baller grandma in this trailer?? 😂🔥
Jordan did it better
They are prob filming this near the chinese concentration camps in LeBron's favorite country
Racist lebron james
With the success of ready player one and confirmed sequel by earnest cline and Spielberg google it of course space jam 2 most likely be successful cause of the RPO formula I can’t wait too see this
One question, why does don cheadle kidnap lebron’s son
Space jam? More like Ready player Toon!
Finally! The looney tunes back on the big screen!!!!
Why am i getting ready player one vibes watching this...iron giant maybe???
Looks corny. Imma love it. Plus Lebron reps my home town.
“what is this some kind of space jam?”
This is literally just a server in ready player one
Lola was distractingly not hot
Can we embargo Hollywood to stop them making these pointless reboots, remakes, sequels, and prequels?
Fix lola.
HOLY CRAP THEY GAVE SAM HIS GUNS BACK
This looks legitimately bad. The writing, acting, and animation all seem unimpressive and the extra cartoons in the background are pure pandering.  I'll see it opening day for sure.
With the success of ready player one and confirmed sequel by earnest cline and Spielberg google it of course space jam 2 most likely be successful cause of the RPO formula I can’t wait too see this
I bet MJ will be at the end⛹🏾‍♂️🏀
That list though!  Superman is disqualified Gandalf wouldn't pass the ball. King kong would fall for lola and not play And the iron giant would be to sweet to try and steal the ball.  Haha
Lee goattttttt
I need to see it for that Iron Giant cameo
no thanks
Look how they massacred my boy...
Yo why they put damain Lillard look gold
Where is Pepe Le Pew??
alguien de español
Ready Player One: I am the most ambitious crossover of pop culture. Space Jam: Hold my wabbit!
No fucking way, they included an "I wish Jaden smith was my son" moment. Someone's a fan of south park.
LOONEY TUNES RING DOESNT COUNT
Lola bunny and her gender fluid ass, smh they ruin everything... RIP PEPE LEPEW
No mel blanc no interest
Well them not being 2D and getting replaced by CGI....fucking AGAIN is whatever but otherwise this movie looks cool.
MJ will always be better to me BUT The movie is still yet to come out so we'll see
1:47 jetsons (top and right)
This trailer gonna have everyone watching the original.
1:46 IS THAT BABY JANE LMAOOOOOO (and Pennywise in the back what a king)
It's like ready player one
I'm here for Lola Bunny. Yes I'm simping and I don't care.
Bill Murray gunna save the day again. Just you wait
Dame- dame time AD- The Brow Diana- Snake Chiney- Spider Klay- water(splash bro) Fire when he gets hot  This is for the people that don't watch basketball and are curious about why they look like that
So do we all agree that we gonna watch this the day it comes out? 🤔
This is worse than the og space jam
MICHAEL JORDAN DID IT BETTER
I wonder how big this movie’s budget is
i refuse to watch this until they change lola bunny
CGI like is 2003 + How can this look worse than the original Space Jam? And why do we keep mixing in all of this IP. We already saw Ready Player One.
The amount of dislikes tho
So space jam is basically LeBron James taking acid Looking for his son and seeing a bunch of cartoon characters!!!!😂😂
This is more like Ready Player One than it is Space Jam
"W H A T  IN   THE   MATRIX  HELL" -Lebelt Buckle James
Lebron and Bronny will be good actors instead of that other kid
1:53 Of Couse Jack Nicholson is in the first row, as Joker89 btw
I feel sorry for the kids that they dont know what they just saw at 2:11 LEGENDARY!!
I wonder if this movie is going to have a virtue signaling scene where LeBron tells his children and all the Looney Tunes characters the cops are out there racially profiling them ? Not gonna see this crap this dude is a disgrace. #defundHollywood
I love seeing more than just the Looney Tunes here! Hanna Barbera toons and the movie ones too! And the 2D animation looks great!!
Nope! Not watching this racist SOB!
Lola look the same to me.
producer: how many   Lebron: yes all the warner bros characters  producer: oh ok
This movie looks as dumb as the first one.... but Im still watching it.😁
If you understood the pass from Lola to Bron u a legend
As much as I don’t like lebron on the court ( he is one of the most dominating players ever yet when things don’t go his way he turns into a crybaby) got to admit he looks like he’ll be a better actor then MJ so this will probably be better then original
Bruuuu
Beast 🔥🔥
Waited so long for this shit... Hell yeah😍
But is like also how could they do this to Lola bunny honestly she was a childhood crush and now look at her
it's your chance do your dance at the space jam!!!
Hopefully bill murray makes a cameo lol
One day I will be the biggest artist in the music industry...manifest 💯🐐🎶👀
World: Come on shoot the ball 🏀  America: 1:26

Wrong tune. Its toon
Hollywood: Let’s remake Space Jam! King James: Hold my Powerade
Meh
Man Big Chungus must have had to do a lot to get back in shape
Damm Lola still got her game
1:46 you guys see pennywise on the right 😂😂😂😂
Was that the mystery inc. van?
I love the original space jam. It was my childhood favorite movie. I watched it every day. With that being said....This looks 10x better.      Edit: I don't even watch basketball so I'm not biased towards anyone.
excited for this 🤘 and also WB we love you man.. dont disappoint us  #RestoreTheSnyderverse
HBO is killing it. They are going to explode when Dune and Matrix 4 comes out
😎🐰👨🏿🏀
I have waited 20 years for the next movie all hear me 🤣🤣
Hmm i dont know bout this lol. Missin the old 1 allready. Mj better make a cameo at least.
I think the story is kinda shitty but we all gonna be watchin it cus the king is playing in it
I actually don’t like Lebrons acting. Maybe In the movie it’ll come off better. But MJs cardboard performance was better from what I see so far
Ready Player Jam
Should be good... also shouldn’t be compared to the first one..
Right as granny says "I'm going old school" you can see some war boys from mad max fury road
Lol this isnt even space jam anymore, its Avengers editing meets Ready Player one. Im still going to watch it though.
Fucking junk. Nice graffix tho.
Half the audience that would have watched because of Lola Bunny, isn’t going to after how they nerfed her.
Why did you do this to Lola..?
👎🏼
Only R kelly had together could made a I believe i can fly part 2
Is that the basquiat crown at the end? 😲
1:50 Anthony Davis (wings) Damian Lillard (clock) Klay Thompson (fire)
0:30 When skynet sends you to Detroit
MJ is still the GOAT!
Jesus saves. Love you guys. A
noiceeeeeeeeeeeeee
Omg Pennywise the dancing clown is in this movie. Pause at 1:46 and look at the right side 😭
Woke player and Disney
I'm Actually Astonished They Changed Lola's Design😩
Spoilers: Kobe is in it and since he dies in real life, his character gets cgi killed as well. In the final match LeBron shoots the final point and whispers: "For Kobe"
So is this a sequel to Ready Player One?
2:22 Dame
noiceeeeeeeee
At 0:13, Bron thinking of trading him
Flintstones, Scooby doo, Space Ghost, Jetsons, Iron Giant, Wizard of Oz, Pennywise, The Mask, Mr. Freeze, King Kong! Everyone from Warner Bros is going to be there!!!!
Date night!
Can't wait to see this movie
Wasn’t expecting much from this, but after seeing this. It looks like it’s going to be a fun movie to watch.
Everyone else: “Wow, I’m so excited!”     Me: “bruh, they didn’t fix lola bunny.”
Don Cheadle! I loved him in Rebound: The Legend of Earl "The Goat" Manigault a classic if you havnt seen it check it out old school film
noicee
noice
“What in the Matrix hell” 😂😂😂 Bron is wild
Why make them cgi?
noice
Granny got skills. 🏀
The haters are just people mad at WB. This looks FIRE
nice
Will I be in this movie please?
nice
OH HELL NO!!!! This joint Whack!! 🤢 Old school better. 🤦‍♂️
he been hyping this shit up for sooo long now cant wait
100% should of been Shaq
Sams got his guns back
It needs a better song, topping jordan is already hard enough, how u gonna beat a classic like "I believe I can fly"?
Why? the first one sucked, why would you think this one is gonna be any better?
Eeehh what’s up duck
The biggest mistake was making him 2d and then making the cartoon characters 3d.
Oh HELL YEAH
0:04-0:05 If you look closely, you can see the current WB logo flipped backward.
Oh, I get it. Instead of Outer Space they went with CYBER space.
THIS IS HEAT
Im seeing tons of positivity and thats great. IMO this looks like shit.
If Michael Jordan shows for a cameo Imah be hypedddd af
The beginning with LeBron's son telling his father to let him be himself instead of forcing him to be someone he's not triggered my PTSD. Speaking of, it's great that this issue is explored in a kids' movie. Hopefully it'll lead to parents doing a better job.
Wow
Pff... So damn lame... This movie should of never been made... Nothing to the original one. The acting is lame as well...
YOOOOOO BIG CHUNGUS IS IN SPACE JAM!!!!
YESSSS
I only came here for "Drogon"😏 #GameOfThronesfan #TeamHouseTargaryen
This looks too much like the ready player one movie for my taste.
Wow millions of dollars into the trash
oh. my. god. the references. space jam 2. The Iron Giant's return. I think I'm in heaven-
🗣KIIIING JAMES 👑💪🏻😤
0:15 The backrooms
Meh
Also youtube  *looney toons back in action*
Ready Player One sequel:Ready Player 23. LOL im just happy it looks good. Can't wait to watch it!
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH TAKE MY FUCKING MONEY
Great job team very cool
OH SHIT
why is he trying to be like michael jordan? there can be only one.
Hope this is good
¿And Pepe?
every dislike are because of how they ruined lola bunny
What is this crap?!!
Only one question  Where The Hell Is Bill Effen  Murray?!?!?!
I hope Michael Jordan makes a cameo and tells Lebron James, "You'll never be as good as me" and everybody cheers and agrees
Noooooo he doesn't deserve this title
2:10 don't tell me they tried to reenact that legendary moment....
HECK FREAKING YEAH, BABY!!!!
Ready Player 2
Let go of your nostalgia from the first one & realize this is going to be a lot better, also to help support my case, Lebron is a phenomenal actor, just watch Trainwreck
Incoming MJ sexuals hating for no reason...
You will never now why i got no likes.
So I guess it’s Ready Player One mixed with Looney Tunes
Not diverse enough of a cast IMO.
With the success of ready player one and the confirmed sequel from Ernest cline of course other movies would use the formula still I can’t wait
What happened to my man Lola 😔😔
WTF happened to lola bunny
Ready Player BRON
any way #restorethesnydervers
Ok its better than Tom & Jerry animation
You don't know how long I've been waiting to see this.
I hope Jordan makes a cameo
1:22 Where are Pepe and Speedy?
I'm going just to see jordan make his appearance 😆
Ngl. But LBJ is actually a good actor
Can we plz get a MJ cameo
I love how you see all of Wanna Bros hanna Barbera's Classic Cartoons,DC Comic and other HBO's hits are all in the Backrounds. Way a go WB/HBO. show your Legacy/Heritage all over again.
still no diversity
This looks terrible lmao
I miss Pepe Le Pew 😒
Did LeBron only agree to this if he was referred to as King James?
But looney tunes is wacist
Where’s AD
1:18 Even LeBron is a great GM in a cartoon.
ready player two looks different
WB presents: a movie nobody asked for
No no no no no no no
WHere is P3p3 L3 P3W?????????? and Sp3dy??????
This is basically one big WB commercial.
remember what they took from us....
Lebron can’t act.
Rip pepe le pew
Alright so I know this is gonna get some hate replies but this movie seems like a cash grab and might ruin the legacy of the first. In other words, this looks awful
Space Jam <<<Michael Jordan 🏀
This looks like garbage.
youre not allowed to kick the ball!
Nah lol
Is this Ready Player 2 or nah?
Jordan is still better and has 6 rings
Seems like this film had a bigger budget than the Avenger movies, with all those crazy cameos.
This has more characters than I used to draw on my brown paper bag book covers
MJ did it better.
Already a better movie than Space Jam and JorClown.
It looks like they reused models from ready player one
damn.
Is there MJ and Kobe cameo?
They better reference Barkley Shut Up and Jam Gaiden in his film. After all, it's canon.
I’m getting ready player one vibes anyone else
Where’s bronny
Ready Player One vibes
I really like LeBron. Seems to be such a nice guy.
Michael Jordan did it better.
Did you rip off Ready Player One?
1:39 I remember that movie
Hyped.
I guess the ready player one formula works they are making an ready player two google it can’t wait for SJ2
Excited!
Did Bronny have homework?   Lebron James: "Bet Will Smith ain't gotta deal with this!" 0:18  He sure don't because he would use his real son Jaden!
1:38 Every team against the Nets this year's playoffs.
MMmmmmmm.... Хуета....
We jammin in space \o/
Welcome to the Space Jam!
Well the animaniacs tower is in thier
The original was amazing but this one seems terrible
"daddy! daddy! who is r kelly?" OH WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT
This is gonna be a flop🚮
I have a theory, what if Hollywood’s just remaking all of our childhood movies because we are in fact I’m a simulation and later on along the years all the original movies we do much remember will be considered a Mandela effect because the newer versions took over
Space Jam is in the Mario Galaxy Universe
I hope they won't forget about animaniacs
"Space Jam: Look at our IP Collection: The Movie"
“COME ON AND SLAM”  Coming to Theaters in 2021
Stanley Kubrick and Anthony Burgess would’ve been honored to see Alex and the droogs in a Space Jam movie!
Well, if the comparison between Lebron & Michael Jordan weren't bad enough before....here comes this movie. 🤣
Lame.
Ruined cartoon
Lola Bunny looks so PG now😂😂😂
the sequel nobody asked for  ever
Will big chungus be in the movie?
ummmm .... sorry, but no
Betttttgtttt this is sick I can’t wait
1:44 Where is King Ghidorah? 😒
Michael Jordan looks a bit different in this one
The moment you realize that Dame, KT, Anthony and Diana Taurasi comprise the Goon Squad...
I’m not sure 🤔 but I’m interested
Weird seeing Don Cheadle as a villian
Okay but are they gonna have a song as good as “I believe I can fly?”
At least were getting a ready player two after Ernest cline confirmed with Spielberg so the formula works can’t wait too see SJ2
I watched this whole thing and forgot about the kid. 😂
Where's the diversity?
If this movie doesn't do well (which I *highly* doubt it won't), everybody's getting beat! 😡 Also, did they just forget how to play basketball? 🤣
I bet it's gonna suck
Never in a million years did I think they’d make another Space Jam.   I ain’t even mad.
Getting famous off of the comments so I can live the dream later!
Le Bron isekai'd to Don Cheadle universe haha
Space Jam was always bad. There. I said it.
trash.....   bron wants to be like MJ so bad, copied his number, doing the same movie
wreck it ralph x ready player one
Why is kong in another movie
Wonder how many people are gonna watch Space Jam for the first time this year
Ready player 2 looks like it’s gonna be hype
Am I the only one obsessed with reading their profiles? Like the height and date of birth LMFAO
Anybody peep the Lebron Lola Bunny Clip, same as the Lebron & D. Wade Heat alley? Easter Eggs gonna be fun to find in this movie!
I want the iron giant to be part of the movie because I love him.
i love how this comes out on my birthday
#freemyniggapepelepew
this soundtrack better be nutty
yo wtf.
is that don cheadle 😩😩
ehhh not enough nostalgia to get me hype. maybe next time GOAT.
Ewww
All those cartoon cameos. Whew! They went all out for this movie!!! 🙌🏽
They should make golf jam with tiger woods
Don
Ngl this looks  pretty lit
What kind of BS is this🙄
Safety?
I hate this already.. the original is classic.. why they had to copy a classic!!!
Can’t wait to watch
this looks visually stunning!! looks like so much fun. hyped asf
I thought ready player one came out years ago
Pennywise even joining in on the right 1:46
Ref shoulda hit the granny with that kickball violation
I just need that Pulp Fiction scene and I'll watch
Lebum
Oh God no 👎
It doesn't look half bad 🤔
Trailer actually looks pretty good 👍👍👍
Why does this look aweosme ?
Why does this exist?
Was it filmed next to a genocidal concentration camp in China? #ComradLebron
Hopefully Jordan makes a cameo in Ready Player One space jam 2 can’t wait too see
Doesn’t look as good as the original
DON CHEADLE!!!!!!!
Anyone know the song at 0:34?
0:25 That's look like Rehoboam from Westworld, but it makes sense, because we have so many cameos, references & easter eggs from movies & TV Shows from Warner Bros. Pictures.  The movie looks Awesome btw.
Pepe le pew
Damn I remember my dad telling me about the original, he still has an original DVD and poster
jordan after watching this: bruh
Wow, lebron still trying to be Jordan.
2:10 look at how they massacred my girl....
Is this pg or m
yes, Warner bros. cause we'd rather watch this, than the snyderverse -_- makes sense
Trash
Where is big Chungus
Mj space jam>>>>>>>lebums jam
So is this actually canon with the first movie?
Hopefully Jordan makes a cameo in RPOspacejam can’t wait too see
Should have just left it alone
🔥🔥❤️
BTW this movie is racist. It neglects our multi cultural society.
No thank you
LeBron: "Hello Newman"
Not gonna lie Absolute down grade from the 1st space jam
So this is ready player 1 but instead of fighting its basketball
Ready player two space jam this is gonna be fun
Character I was most surprised to see in this trailer: Pennywise at 1:46 🎈
Guns are back, but no Pepe Le Pew :/
I can't wait until they remake all of R Kelly's crimes in the new space jam. kids will love it! (well, except kelly's victims)
Imagine they pulled the Sonic remodel with Lola to resemble her old look
Вратарь калактики?
Where’s Bronny???????????
Dang the Looney Tunes look awesome in real life 👍🏻.
Holy shit
Space jam ready player two I’m so excited
*This Movie Feels Souless*
No
Did they really juat rip off ready player one with the other universes coming together 😆 same characters and all.
Ngl this is a bit cringe but just the right amount so I'm pretty fucking excited for this movie
No
1:25 SHOOT THE BALL 🏀
Not feeling it....*sigh* some things are better left alone...
Yessir space jam
Why did the rabbit turn into a sexless creature?
This looks better than the original ngl
Ready Player Pixels 2
I GOT MY UBER EATS ACCOUNT REACTIVATION SUCCESSFULLY WITH THE HELP OF *CODED_HACK* ON INSTAGRAM. HE'S JUST THE BEST!✔
LeFlop
So that’s it huh... we just some kinda Space Jam 2: A New Legacy?
Wouldn’t be awesome for Jordan to cameo while driving the delorean from ready player one
we want pepe le pew
damn, didn’t know they were doing a second ready player one.
... And I Took that personally. Mj  Return of the king 2021-22
Restore pepe the pew 🇫🇷
yo the bron jame in a movie? 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
1:41 Drogon is that you?
Did you know: R kelly is currently in jail for doing the No No with children. ♪ I BELIEVE I CAN FLY (away from jail) ♪
I WANT LOLA BUNNY REMADE CORRECTLY
Whatever Bron does now, Michael Jordan did FIRST.
It looks like a barely better version of Ready Player One. Barely.
Warner bros did very well man!
ayo wtf 🔥🔥💯
This movie so good, it’ll  make you ignore people fighting for rights in Hong Kong.
Lola with the d wade oop. Nice.
Ready player space jam... Ok I guess..
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Lola Bunny with the Dwayne Wade pose is too good
Thick Lola or riot
Thank you ready player one you showed it’s possible with the virtual world and Easter egg formula and I’m sold thank you RPO and Warner bros this is gonna be awesome
Lebron James x Looney Tunes x Don Cheadle 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
🔥
If you'd show me this when I was a kid, I would've had a seizure.
I feel like a kid again ngl. Can’t wait to watch this. Been waiting TOO long.
I see Iron giant I will watch for Iron giant
No sir, I don't like it. Didn't like the original either tho
I don’t care if there’s no story, this visually looks amazing.
That’s hard
Ready Player lebrOne
Cool!
Fuck no.
It’s not about Luna no more. We still got granny
This looks kinda bad
Yo this is gonna crazy. We've waited so long for this
Ready Player One sequel?
I just saw Godzilla vs kong. An epic film 😆  Now I saw this epic trailer😆 What a day😊
Can't believe they let Yosemite Sam keep his guns and shoot someone.
Hope he doesn’t flop and cry
this roster still better than the 2014-2015 cavaliers team 💀💀
rejob bamse
Not impressed
This. movie. is. a. terrible. idea.
MJ>>>>>>LJ
🤯🤯🤯🤯 King James ❤❤❤
I'm not impressed. That's MJs role....period. plus his acting is terrible. This looks like a trainwreck and I can't wait for the disaster waiting to happen.
Lola got nerfed so hard...
♪ everybody get up, it's time to cringe now ♪
So weak compared 2 the 1st 1
Man not even 0:00 in this video and I’m getting flexed on
No me lo esperaba pero... HEY!  Se ve muy bien!!! 👍
Za dużo czarnego.
But it's not in space.
What have they done to you Lola
Let the memes begin
They nerfed Lola...
Im gonna watch this on shrooms 💃🏼✨
Hopefully they focused on making a good movie and not a woke movie
This looks awesome. I grew up with Space jam. I think kids are going to like it.
Wow, I didn’t know a movie could look this 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
This looks way better than the original and I grew up in the 90. Y’all hating!
Ready Player Two: They Play Basketball Now
R E A D Y   P L A Y E R   TWO   It even copy and pasted kong and iron giant 😂
Michael Jordan are you watching this film damn 😱 😱 amazing
I just punched a hole in my wall, I'm so freaking mad. I can't believe they gave granny smaller melons.
Kuroko’s basketball looking real different with these new powers
Can't wait to see Kuzma make airball at the free throws
Where’s Marvin he was supposed to be here I am a huge fan of him I hear that he’s gonna play for the time on this time last time he was just a referee so where is he.
So the 3D is supposed to represent the realistic world and then you got the 2D cartoon style, that's cool
Holy father of all memes
I never thought I’d see King Kong, the Scooby gang, and some dragon in the same movie with the loony tunes. Sign me up!
Lol he had to build a super team in order to win a championship.
Release the new theme song!
It's bad april joke, right? Not real movie...
What in the ready player one is this
how is kyrie irving and other basketball players gonna star in this????
Glad to see the The Bron James, famous actor and athlete, to appear in the cinema once more!
2:11 Lola did the D-Wade
Wh...what....year is this again????🤨🧐
THE MY GOD!!!!!!
Me : ducking basta**d how the heck he got oxygen in vaccum.
This trailer sucks it makes no sense and it's not as good as michael jordan space jam no disrespected to lebron james but I don't like this trailer
Bet he chokes in the last game.
They should redesign Lola Bunny like how they redesigned Sonic.
No Scrappy-Doo.
Cute. I'm sure kids will love this. I loved the original Space Jam from the 90's.
You ain’t Jordan
why does lebron james love the chinese government so much? very odd
OH SHIT
If I don’t see Chris Rock as Osmosis Jones in this imma be pissed.
... can’t you just watch the first space jam? That would be nostalgic.
That aint the real "goon squad" They copied my boys over at Goonzquad on youtube.
Lets see if anyone can find Alex DeLarge from A Clockwork Orange anywhere in this trailer.
He'll yeah can't wait for Space Jam A New legacy looking forward this look awesome 👈👍👏👏⚡💯🔥. Good see Bugs Bunny and the rest of the Looney Tunes 🙌. man there a lot of characters in Warner Brothers 🏀
Yep... Was worried they'd go CG and of course they did.
THE GOAT
Can't wait!!!!!
space jam more like jamming in space
Looney Tunes better be the focus of this though!
Bruh i'm not even a fan of basketball but, this trailer gave me heavy goosebumps 😧🤯
I just wanted the looney toon characters to play a way better team. This feels.......wrong
Lemickey
La Woke James taking over MJ’s role? No thanks
Hol up wrong floor
2:19 smmmmmmmmmmmOKIN!!!
I SAW FREAKING SCOOBY DOO
That looks pretty horrible honestly...
Why are Yosemite Sam's eyelids covered in hair?
Michael Jordan, who starred in the first film, said he will not be returning for a sequel and rather have someone else take over for him, which is LeBron James.
nah this fire
I think I saw the Animaniacs in the Fred Flintstone shot
2:07 2k cages
They should’ve put me on the list
This is either gonna be one of the best sequels ever or terrible 😔
Lebron the Racist James shouldn't have even be allowed to act in this film!
GEN Z RUINED LOLA BUNNY AND CANCELED PEPE LE PEW
Wait, im confused, arent guns offensive now? shouldnt all movies be using water guns now?  Also not surprising lebron is a fascist who is controlling of his son, It would be funny if bugs made a joke that the guy was a terrible actor who has the iq of a carrot and is incredible racist and ignorant.
Won’t be as good as the original just like coming 2 America
This is going to be terrible and that was before the woke police nerfed a few characters....now they might as well just go straight to dvd and put it in the $5 bin
If they don’t mention their game with Jordan or the monstars I’m gonna be disappointed.
sin pepe le pew no es lo mismo esta película, esa generación de cristal vale 3 atados
Rachid Élya
why did don cheadle challenge lebron to a basketball game of all things? why didn't he challenge him to something lebron james is bad at, like defending freedom of speech
This movie gonna make some waves well and a lot of pauses when this hits streaming and tomorrow Easter too, a movie loaded with lots of Easter eggs did you see penny wise can’t wait for July
They just straight up ripped Ready Player One tho
Ready player 1 Warner bros edition
1:07 That scream 🤣
I been waiting for 5his movie
2:11 “The Wade To Lebron” Refrence 💀
Don't have any issues with *Lola's* changes.  It was the reasons given for the changes that left me scratching my head.
This Looks Better Than it Has Any Right To Be.
Wreck it Ralph, ready player one, and basketball mixed together
Alright alright alright
I kinda hope they do a Kobe tribute at the end of the movie. 👌
SHEEESH
#Justiceforlola
а белые люди существуют?
LeBron since u can do a movie can you plz step in the boxing ring???
Looks like nba playgrounds
Kobe deserved to be in this!
This looks like Ready Player One and I'm not dissapointed.
Fucking ruined Lola
So nice
Yeah... that's going to be a no for me
Come on and Slam! If you wanna Jam!!! 🏀🐰🏀
Lebron loves slavery in China
Very Off-The-Wall.. as it should
Amazing, they took an already stupid movie and made it even dumber. Why are they explaining the lore behind Space Jam? No was asking how the Loony Toons were able to interact with Michael Jordan or if other fictional worlds existed in the movie, we just accepted that it was a silly, stupid, movie, and you didn't need all the answers. By trying to explain it, you just make it look dumber.
Gonna watch this to see granny play
Exactly
The 3500 dislikes are probably furries who wanted their Lola design back. #NotMyLola All jokes aside, this looks surprisingly good.
hopefully they don’t copy the secret stuff
Trash ass movie
I can’t believe Big Chungus lost so much weight for this role
Looks like Warner bros has figured out the Easter egg formula and virtual universe after ready player one thank you RPO I’m sold I really excited for this movie
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Trash!
Lolaa
This is gonna be epic!! ;)
You can never be a Jordan bro never gonna happen
Where’s the secret stuff?
how they gonna keep yosemite sam with his guns shooting but remove pepe le pew🙄 the skunk was actually funny
That Senior Discount got me. XD
This film encourages gun violence. I demand you remove Yosemite Sam and LeBron James from this film....
Looks like Warner bros has figured out the Easter egg formula and virtual universe after ready player one thank you RPO I’m sold I really excited for this movie
Lola just isn't as hot anymore
Eh. The original is always best.
*WELCOME TO THE SPACE JAM*
"What in the Matrix hell?" 😂 I'm a 90s kid and loved the original, but this looks like it'll be good. This movie seems different enough from the original not to ruin things for people if it bombs.
Who else is PUMPED for this?
Anyone notice Lola bunny doing the Dwyane wades iconic photo??
Who has the better movie would definitely settle this GOAT debate
Way to much cgi for me
Iron giant😭😭❤
My kids, 9 and 12, watched this trailer and couldn’t name a single character. That’s how irrelevant these IPs are now, thanks to the crazy neglect their owners have given them. And now they want kids to be excited for this? No. A few millennials maybe but no kids.
Man screw Scoob this movie is bringing all the Hannah Barbara characters
Space Jam 2.o on release date🤔
If they have all the actors from the first film, then this is *canon.*
Woke James
i need to say it this movie isnt gonna be better tan the other but mee
🤮
yes
why is yogi bear there 1:43
Nobody asked for this.
Would of been awesome if goon squad had Michael Jordan. Then we see who the real GOAT is!
This looks like a low budget ad
smh cant believe they desexualized lola remember what they took from us
Wait! Why this looks fun?
Lebron copying jordan
Are we just going to ignore drogon?
Most trending! I also saw Space Jam.
they should have made kobi the star not lebron
White walkers!!!!!!
What's with the voice audio quality??
Lol it’s just ready player one with basketball. No thanks
This is like the movie pixels and ready player one combined
Wheres Dababy and Jordan???
Tron
At the beginning of the trailer, I swear I hear a sound that sounds like the Nintendo switch error
I had my doubts but this looks epic!
Win is it coming out
Damn DC did the multiverse before Marvel lol  Superman gotta team up with bugs bunny and scooby doo to save the multiverse!
Watching LeBron being the main character in the new space jam instead of Michael Jordan is the same feeling I got when I found out Ben Affleck was playing Batman.
Gives me ready player 1 vibes
Lola looks like she on drugs 😂
i wanna watch space chimps
Rhodey be like this is his job after the events of Endgame
This is giving me Ready Player One vibes....  Can't wait to watch it when it releases!
Looks good i kinda miss the Monstars tho. I understand this is a new different movie but idk i used to like em
This looks more like a commercial than a movie  At least the graphics look good
The adaptation of ready player two looks good.
🏀This movie is too righteous! I hope Michael Jordon makes a cameo in this movie too!👍
All I have to say is that they better find some way to actually make the crowd *react* to things on the court instead of just standing around and fist-pumping.  It's a joke that they did a lazy re-used asset job for most of that crowd.
I can already see the Honest Trailers title this new Space Jam as "Ready Player Bron" 🤣🤣🤣
🤣I just started standup and want ur OPINION. Am I FUNNY? This is not ur usual garbage self promotion. (Please LIKE and SUBSCRIBE if u LOL) Watch the Time Traveler set.
2:10 it was allways my dream for lola bunny to at least wink at me since the first space jam. SIMPNESS OVERLOADING.
Not interested  #RestoreTheSnyderVerse
CLASSIC
The Iron Giant tho, what a classic goat
I saw this coming just didn't know when
This trailer isn't very innovative. I bet the real Space jam was better
All the dislikes are LeBron HATERS
this is exceeding expectations
Lebron James just isn't Michael Jordan. He doesn’t have the same charisma let alone cross-racial appeal. All the stupid scribbles on his arms don’t give off the family friendly vibe and above all else he’s not much of a looker. Definitely not a replacement for Jordan. They’d unironically be better off making a tennis movie.
This ain’t even gonna be Space Jam. This about to be “hey I remember them” the movie😂. I was already like “hey I remember this and that and him and them” 😂
This looks nothing like the original.
Is this the sequel to Read Player One?
I love all the idiots who seriously think Space Jam 1 was some kind of heartfelt art piece. Lol  This sequel looks fine.
Ready player 2?  NBA dlc?
On the way to bullshit imagination 😂😂😂 way down from 180 IQ to 0👍👍
Squad City Dj
Pearl jam
Wait... where’s Big Chungus?
ouu! this is cool!
This have some Ready Player One vibes and i love it.🔥🔥
1:12 should've said "What's up Bron"
Nothing in the trailer looks outstanding. Even the 2d is meh
I want a grand dad reference in the movie or we riot
Space Jam 2: Hey Bro, can I copy your homework? Ready Player One: Sure, just  change it up a bit so it doesn't look too obvious. :
I hope Marvin the Martian is the ref again.
I’m just happy Yosemite Sam kept his guns
So this is where Lebron was during his injury
I'm surprised they let Yosemite Sam keep his guns haha
Que le hicieron a la hermosa Lola bonny 😩
Ready Player Two : Electric Boogaloo
Give us a Leto joker Batman fight scene ?!
I cccccc spoce jom.... Can't wait
1 on trending in America!
RIP in peace hot lola bunny. You will always be remembered 😢
I’m guessing this is one of the reasons why some Six Flags are opening up again soon... 😮😄
nah
Lame.
I’m waiting for bugs bunny to start speaking mumble rap or else I won’t watch this at all
would have been funny if they would have put Pepe Le Pew on the evil team... makes more sense than cancelling him
Soooo.... sequel? Or Reboot? Do the looneytunes remember Michael?
Looks meh
Would be hilarious if the Brooklyn Nets show up in the end and say *Great, now you face us*
?? w h a t
meh
Really looking forward to this looks intresting
Hit em high hit em high hit em low hit em low
Nobody outside of America knows who LeBron James is.
Idk bout this one
Jordan after watching the trailer, "and I took that personally"
wow this looks great and epic I can't wait to see it
Alt title: ready player 2
Brooo finallyyyyy
The nostalgia is running down me so quick.
Lebron: "where's my son?" *Don cheadle brings out his son*  "boom you lookin' for this!"
🙌🏽
Still better than GOT S8
idc im kinda excited for this lol
do you think the chinese government will allow space jam to play in the mainland if lebron james stays a good little puppet?
Who can't wait for the Space Jam memes coming up?
jajaja lo maximo los looney tunes!! el pato lucas es un crack!
Ah shit, here we go again.
Waited decades for this I new lebron was coming for years
NICKI MINAJ 🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄
I need a Dexter, Dee Dee, PPG, Johnny Bravo, and Ed, Edd, n Eddy cameo.
wait what.
This shit does nothing to do with Lb career
2:04-Kath Soucie's back as Lola Bunny! *({DEBUNKED} It's actually Zendaya)* 2:10-Looking good, Lola! 2:24-They got a new actress for Granny, Candi Milo. 2:28-Call her old? She prefers the term *"EXPERIENCED!"* They really remixed this "Space Jam" song. :)
My god this looks terrible.
I swear you guys try to find anything to complain about just shut tf up
Docter Strange sent me to Ready Player One.
#MakeTheBatfleckMovie #RestoreSnyderverse People, keep disliking WB's trailers until they realize again what DC fans actually want. We want real DCEU what Snyder started. Not this Marvel copycatting mockery shit!
Waer is tom & jerry ???
It was ironic for me to say that this is the movie I have been waiting all of my childhood but now these cameos, great story, and Don Cheadle as the villain is making this THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE PERIOD!!!!
Massive emoji movie vibe to it. Could it be worse ?
I guess this officially makes lebron the Jordan of our time
So ain't nobody gonna talk about Pennywise being in the background? 1:46
Space jam more like the server is Jam.
Too this look low-key lit
Skip: Lola Bunny saved LeBron's legacy!
where is kevin hart?
I'll only watch this if Michael Jordan has a cameo in it.
Proverbs 23:8 You will vomit up the little you have eaten and will have wasted your compliments.  Revelation 18:23 The light of a lamp will never shine in you again. The voice of bridegroom and bride will never be heard in you again. Your merchants were the world's important people. By yourmagic spell all thenations were led astray.   James 1:15 Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.   Galatians 6:7 Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.
A
Dude this is fire 🔥
HAND DRAWN ANIMATION, LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
What they do to Lola tho 😩
**Lebron James is in Space Jam sequel.**  Michael Jordan: You don't want me for the sequel? Okay fine.
I love the Lola Bunny nod to the classic D-Wade photo where he looks at the camera after getting the ball to LeBron at a similar angle.
Ready Player One Part 2?
The first was better
Hard pass!
1:25 guns? CANCELLED
I still kinda miss old Lola bunny I hope her personality is still the same at least
DID YOU SEE THE MYSTERy VAN?? AND FLEINSTONES????
Ready Player Two looks good... XD
let's find out who's going to cancel culture this movie because of the Looney Tunes!  #CancelCultureIdiots  next
So both Disney and Warner Bros have flexed there universes in a movie- maybe it’s time Nickelodeon catches up 🤷‍♂️
you know whats so funny? they toned down Lola Bunny because this should be a "kids" movie lebron james just cursed in this trailer and said "what in the matrix HELL" @0:27 did anyone noticed that? so what was the point? of toning down Lola then? thats how u know they were just making up excuses ...they should've LEFT Lola Bunny the way how she was ..her body wasn't even that exaggerated SMH weird thirsty men just draw their fan pic that way but the original movie she wasn't that bad ...to be honest i'm not even hype about this movie i hate when they change the original  PS did i just see DROGON? from game of thrones?!?!! @1:41 and It the clown @1:45 far right
I just hate this so much. This is like the low point of originality for the movie industry. Everyone should boycot this movie just to show the big studios that we want new stories and not just sequels, spin-offs, cameos and rehashings.
If there isn’t big chungus in this imma cry
We want Lola back!
[sigh].........no
Where is he... WHERE'S GODZILLA! (I'm sure they would have included him, but they would have had to pay toho a lot of money)
This reminds me of ready player one
I still kinda miss old Lola bunny
We needed a new space jam
Shag is gonna be mad about the Iron Giant calling himself Superman
It’s gonna be a no from me.
Us 90s kids can think what we want, but the animation looks incredible.
I want all the cameos, all the dragons, all the WB IP
...fuck is goin on?
I hope they play the Original Space Jam song by Quad City DJ's. Can't be a Space Jam movie without that song!!!!
I wasn't interested in this, but don cheadle being the bad guy just turned me 100% around on it
I don’t like L James.  Michael Jordan did it better.  Damn BLM communist activist. You’ll never be as good as MJ when it comes to space jam..
This took so many years to do and its somehow worse than OG. Only reason i watch this is bc i got hbo already and Looney Toons. Rest of it is trash
remember that time china illegally detained democratically elected officials in order to hold bogus elections and subjugate the people of hong kong? lebron james doesn't remember, and he says that if you do then you're just a CCP hater
That grandma got moves
I love it !!!
Oh yeah
the animation looks really good but the plot is so dumb😭😭
This is like wreck it Ralph two and ready player one combined. Let’s hope it’s good
Wtf
It's like someone remembered all the FWOOSH from Galactic Football and went "Y'know what? SPACE JAM"
Where is conjuring 3 trailer man
Alright adults, if you ain't high watching this. You're not doing it right.
Let’s go!
this is basically ready player one but sith ab properties only
Wow
Im just gonna stick with the original
Why does this look like READY PLAYER ONE
Looks very expensive
Animaniacs, flinstones, yogi bear, iron giant, scooby doo, jetsons, all that's missing is pepe le pew
Thats cool and all but why'd you do Lola bunny like that😭
And I took that personally.
How to ruin a legendary movie name!SHAME JAM:A NEW FLOP
anyone know Whats the familiar background music @ 0:32
watch it turn out horrible
Good trailer, but it is sad that I was shocked to see Yosemite Sam using his guns. Like I was already having to expect them to take those away to be PC.
These kids gonna be like I know bron but who are these characters ?!
Ready player 2
totally irresponsible. think of all the elderly trying to pommel horse on their walkers and dying thanks to Space Jam.
That wink at 2:10 was on purpose due to the whole bunny thing
Will watch for nostalgia and Don Cheadle as the villain 💯
Looks excellent!!
Fire
Trash
LeBron James supports slavery
WELCOME TO THE CHINESE-BOOT-LICKING JAM
Welcome to 90's and early 2000's Cartoon Network
😳🤢😂😂😂😂
This is actual gold
Grandma went GramTime On Dame Lol 2:26
No Lebron youre a complete disappointment
WELCOME TO THE JAM
Based. Daffy lookin fresh in his suit.
🚮🚮🚮🚮
I hope the last play of the game that will lead to winning the TuneSquad will be a “BLOCKED BY JAMES” instead of a mega dunk by MJ like in the old SpaceJam.
People don't actually think this looks good do they? I feel like we just like being marketed to and sold bs at this point.
I was beaten by CCP agents for hours for loving my people, for not wanting Hong Kong to come under authoritarian communist rule... Lebron James, WHYYYYYYYY
Ppl got a problem with being themself SMH.....Bro they could atleast let him do a Lebron Dunk....Okay Lebron you need your own shadow fam...this guy imitating Jordan on a whole new level........I wanna see this flim regardless though lol.
#ReleaseThePepeLePewCut
So... Space Jam + Hook + Ready Player One = Profit?
Looks like MJ isn't only the better basketball player but had the better Space Jam as well.
Let me see if I understand this:  You cancel the Pepe Le Pew cartoon character for trying to romance a cat, but stay mum on a clockwork orange, in which a brutal rape was shown?  You actually added Clockwork characters, too?!?  Way to go, WB... 😳🙄😳
Hollywood is devoid of any original ideas
double wide surprise
⚡️⚡️⚡️
I can just tell the little boys gonna throw a fit when they find out a WNBA player is in here... aka Diana Taurasi.
This looks absolutely terrible
2:10 No way Lola just did Dwyane Wade's celebration
So you’re telling me Lebron can potentially play on a basketball team with Fred Flinstone and Jon Snow? This movie will be a masterpiece!
We want Pepe le pew!!!!!!
Great they ruined a childhood classic what a shame
Lola doesn’t look that bad in the movie
Bronny be Like 👁👄👁
For every one that had a negative comment... u do know that nobody forced u to come watch the trailer and we surely arent forcing u to go see it, just dont watch it and be quiet, dont come watch it and complain... half of yall know u dont like lebron anyway so i have no idea why your watching his movie trailer🤷🏾‍♂️
The effects tho :D
Now THIS is cringe
Looks pretty good
This will be a BET classic 👌
Yikes
You people are acting like the original space jam was such a great movie. Nostalgia is something else
China’s gonna love this movie
Well that's just a pile of hot garbage.
LeBron is the greatest player of all time
Get it, Granny!
bruh
Honestly who cares
Пойдёть.
I CALL UPON ALL AMERICANS TO BOYCOTT THIS MOVIE UNTIL THEY MAKE LOLA SEXY
Was that Drogon?! 😭😭
Lebron James getting sent to looney tunes by Rhodey
Lebron a good actor on and off the court
Way better performance them mj hands down👌
Who else thought this was fake for a sec
"What if Don Cheadle was an evil wizard? + Plot of Hook + WB remembering they own an ass-ton of intellectual properties = I have no idea if this is going to be good, but one can hope."
Yikes
I don’t care what anybody says I’m looking forward to this movie. I like the first movie despite it being Critically panned. Even if others do not like this movie I’ll like it either way. Maybe it’s just a nostalgia in me
Trash
**spoiler alert** he wins, i bet you thought this would never happen
Spoiler! Caution!      Michael Jordan, will make a surprise apperence!
You know. It's not gonna beat the OG for me, but I'm glad the new generation gets some Space Jam with the player they followed. James does a lot of good, and a lot of kids look up to him. And, not gonna lie, that new Space Jam song is kind of amazing.
China owned lebum who Wants nothing to do with white people😂😂😂this movie will do as good as the NBA ratings are doing
I'm surprised I didn't see Michael
where's shaq, he would be awesome as an cartoon! haha
Wut
........That.........was..........AWESOME!!!
THIS IS MY JAM HERE 🏀
DOOOOONNN CHEEEAAADDDLLLEEEE
Bronny should have been the son on the movie 💀
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
I can’t believe they couldn’t get Bronny or Bryce to play Lebron’s son in this movie
im sick of recycled movies..this looks stupid..Lebron is shit..not paying to see to see this
Boom,  are you looking for this?
Do they play for the soul of his son, or what?
Definitely going to watch this.
This confirms it, Daffy Duck for Smash!
a sequel to a boomer movie for a generation of kids that have never heard of or care about loony tunes. this might be the worst idea ever
This Summer, Al-G and the Goon Squad are history when the Tune Squad are done with them.
Damn Grannie got some moves
Good fucking grief. Literally can't make anything with new ideas.
Garbage sucks for you next gen you get a sub par knockoff of a great movie
This is just Ready Player One, but basketball.
I it's missing the charm of the original.
2:23 Top right corner - ThunderCats
im barely a teen and i can name more then half of the cartoon  characters in this trailer
why is don cheadle in this shit and why is lebron animatedddd whyy
Throw back to michal jorden
let's goooooo
REFRENCES PEOPLE ! ALL THE REFRENCES IS WHAT MADE ME SQUEAL
Are any of the cartoons characters voiced by Will Forte this time?
What the f**k is Michael Burnham doing there?? O,O
Give us the Monstar.
I CANT EVEN SPELL CORRECTLY
oh that's creative!
YES0  YEESD YES
Omg the warner siblings im crying 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Who else got a sour taste in their mouth when they saw game of thrones stuff 😂 and obviously the rest of this movie
2:17 There's even THE MASK (Right corner) in the film, I'm certanly watching it in theaters if possible.
It took 25 years, but we finally have a sequel to Space Jam.  ...or...is this just Ready Player One all over again as well?
It's been a long time coming
Why tf is the bunny so ugly now tf
Is it weird that all I wanted was the original Space Jam again but with LeBron James instead of Micheal Jordan?
The Micheal Jordan one is. Better.
The Goon Squad may have more talent, but you know what the Tune Squad has that the Goon Squad does not? The Tune Squad has heart.
Jordan not in it why bother
酷。👍👍👍
Wow honestly didn’t expect it to look this Good! Saw the original Space Jam in theatres when i was younger. This one will be a treat!🙌🏻
Flights gonna gas lebron so hard for this one, wannabe mj
Bill Murray?
1:45 pennywise in the background on right
Ah shit here I go again
They nerfed Lola 😔
It’s PERFECT
I once met Lebron James at a KKK rally, he was the special speaker who was championing that races should never mix, he was a nice lad
“What’s Up Doc” MADE MY MOUTH DROP
Looks like crap, stars a china shill.
1:18 LeGM
Wow this looks amazing!!! King James all the way!! 💕💕💕
that "haaaaaaa" got me dead
Looks like 3,000 Warriors fans have watched this so far.
So hyped.
THE BIGGEST AND GREATEST BASKETBALL GAME  OF THE CENTURY
Where is the “LeGM picking all the best players to carry him” comments
Delete this
1:28 i have to do admit, i laughed out loud for that scene.. 😆
Rip lola
So we just gonna ignore the fact the WB ripping off Ralph Breaks the lnternet?!
LeBron must have asked wb to make this movie for his legacy
Fun fact: There’s gonna be a big chungus cameo
Maybe they can just leave "king james" in that "domain" so we don't have to see or listen to his ridiculous opinions about things he knows nothing about??
👑+🥕
Justice for Pepe LePew!!!
🚀 🏀
Im ready for this hell yea baddass movies 2021
Other superstars?
Yall saw Superman as someone LeBron wanted on his team? Clark Kent can hoop.
You know I do not feel bad anymore Pepe lepew got canceled from this movie... He got spared this montrosity...
Mean while...Bronny is somewhere hitting a joint
Will never be better than 1
🤢🤮
There should have been a MJ cameo
im not sure if its good or bad
I love this I just love it and if they have The Looney Tune Show Lola then I just found my 2nd fav movie ever
... another Sequel far worse than the original.
i can't wait until lebron stares directly into the camera to tell the audience "hong kong will never be free, and that's a good thing"
Lola bunny. Somethings off i can feel it.
MJ wile looking at the trailer: Ummmm can I join this
looks like Pixels
I don't care how stupid the movie will be... I embrace it! Looking forward to it!!
Normies dream team: lebron, kobe, kevin durant, etc Lebron dream team: Super man, gandalf, king kong, Iron Giant.
Michael Jordan 2
Damn this looks LIT 🔥🔥🔥🔥👀
Who else is surprised that this actually looks good??
I wanna hate this but I cant
This movie looks fire 🔥🔥🔥
ew.
Was that DROGON on there??
WELCOME TO THE SPACE JAM
Any chance of a Michael Jordan cameo?
Brought to you by CCP pictures
Why did they have to nerf Lola?
Generic. Soulless. Lacking humor. A poor substitute of the original looking purely to cash in on nostalgia. It's a product of corporate mediocrity, guided by test audiences and should fit in perfectly with everything else Hollywood produces in the 2020s.
release the snyder cut of this horrible shlock, i guarantee it'll be better than whatever this garbage is now
Hold this L. They're trying to hard to make it superior to the first one. I rather watch another crappy Alien sequel Lol!
bronny should've never smoked the zaza
Who else saw pennywise just chillen 🤣this movie looks nuts!
Can’t wait to watch lebron flop and cry in this fake universe.
Ew.
Cartoon JAMES INSTEAD OF WAY SPACE JAM 1 WAS WITH JORDAN NOT ANIMATED?
NIGA Film.
lebron james: i wish i could be as famous and loved as michael jordan, but now i have to act in a... warner brothers movie... a fate worse than death...
Not only this but they finally updated their website 25 years later
Nobody asked for this.
I wonder if the CN characters will show up!
Michael Jordan better make a cameo
I’m kinda glad they didn’t just copy the original
Is that "Scylla" by RL Grime I hear?
I think I'll pass on this one.
Michael Jordan > LeBron James
No helll no
LETS GOOOOOOOOO. HYPE
Two days late for an Aprils fools joke right? Hold up, this is real?
R.I.P. Pepe Le Pew 😢😞😭 (1945 - 2021)
Cool! Awesome get better LeBron James yeah buddy
the space *JAM*
Boooo
They had the perfect chance to get bronny
Pennywise at 1:45😳
It is a fact!  They have offended my childhood and the great project that was SPACE JAM with Michael Jordan.  What's this "Wreck-It Ralph" plagiarism hoax !? I hope people don't spend to see this movie.
...why is he lighter?
Who is LeBron going to trade this time? Exciting movie!
Just realized Pennywise IT is in the crowd (1.46) wtf they really do have everyone in this movie 😂
Is it just me, or does Tweety sound different?
0:35 I imagine him being drafted to Winterfell Direwolves if he landed here.
The only thing stopping me from wanting to watch this is the Basketball stuff but seeing Fred Flintstone, Scooby Doo and other characters in this movie is really exciting.
What the heck did y'all do to Space Jam?.. I can tell already the first one is hundred times better than what y'all did.
Need to hear IM 36 Lol
Already a terrible plot line they got too much money that they spend on dumb stuff
black father and black kings?  i guess they fit in around toons, as they are make believe too
the new ready player one trailer looking kinda good
Bill Murray will save us all.
Jordan still the man🐏
This has more character crossovers than my imagination
Okay okay I see you Bron I see you let's get it
Granny: Senior discount! Lol
Not bad that’s something awesomeness from Shaq to Lebron
Ik damn well this about to be trash
Kobe isn’t in the movie. Not interested
Omg yes lol 😆
1:25 i guess this is WB's response to Karens complaining about guns in looney toons
Death, it's one of the biggest events that will ever take place in your life. We face death everyday, conscious or unconsciously of it; death lurks around every corner of our life. Like a lion waiting to catch its prey, death comes for us all in many shapes and form; seemingly there is no one who can escape from the jaws of death. But did you know there is a reason why we die? The idea of death you're familiar with is only the tip of the iceberg. See we die because we've sinned against God. Death according to the bible is wages " for the wages of sin is death " (Romans 6:23). Because man sinned against God, we live in a fallen world, it was once perfect, but now in ruins. Now that sin exists, God is coming to judge the world In righteousness. "It's appointed a man once to die and after this judgement" (Hebrews 9:27) The standard he'll judge you by is the 10 commandments, God's moral law. He's so serious about sin that he gave anyone who sins the death sentence, the bible says you've earned it through sinning against God and God pays you in death. each time you sin you build up his wrath. “The soul who sins shall die.” (Ezekiel 18:4) The punishment is the eternal fires of Hell " Where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matthew 13:42) You will have to face God on Judgement Day.  Will you go to Heaven or Hell? Here’s a quick test:  1.You shall have no other gods before Me. (Have you always loved God above all else?)  2.You shall not make yourself an idol. (Have you made a god in your mind that you're more comfortable with, a god to suit yourself?)  3.You shall not take God's name in vain. (Have you ever used God's holy Name as a cuss word?)  4.Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy.  5.Honor your father and mother.  6. You shall not murder. (God considers hatred to be as murder, 1 John 3:15).  7. You shall not commit adultery. ("Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart" Matthew 5:27-28; this also includes sex before marriage).  8. You shall not steal. (Have you ever stolen anything? the value of the item is irrelevant).  9. You shall not lie. (Have you lied even once? Including answering these questions).  10. You shall not covet. (Have you ever jealously desired what belongs to others?)  James 2:10 says, “the person who keeps all of the laws except one is as guilty as a person who has broken all of God’s laws.”   The Bible says that God will punish all murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, adulterers, etc. He will even judge our words and thoughts.  If you have done any of those things, God sees you as guilty of breaking His law and the Bible warns that the guilty will end up in Hell. Will YOU be guilty on Judgement Day?   "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23)  God sent His Son to suffer and die on the cross. Jesus took the punishment upon Himself and defeated death on the cross; not because your Good but because God is rich in mercy.  “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.” (John 3:16)  Jesus rose from the dead and defeated death. Repent (turn from sin) today and trust in Jesus and God will grant you everlasting life.  Then, Read the Bible and obey what you read.  Pray something like this:  "Dear God, today I turn away from all of my sins (name them). This day I put my trust in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. He is the only way for me to be saved. He is 'The way, the truth, and the life.'" Please forgive me, change my heart, and grant me Your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen."  When you find time please read this, it's Christian principles for growth:   https://www.livingwaters.com/save-yourself-some-pain/
I'm hyped, I really wanna see this.
No! We want MJ!
Michael Jordan better be the final boss
I wonder if he can go to Westeros and introduced himself as "King" James
If this doesn't have an Action RPG spin-off Imma be sad.
Ready player one, wreak it Ralph 2...... welp
Bron: I need to assemble an elite team Smoove: LEE GIIIEEEEMMMM
Fake hairline lol
This is the most important post you’ll ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Surrender your life to him now while you can, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... And as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
What if TINY TOONS made cameos?
🤸‍♀️🙃❤️
The grandma😭✋🏾
What in the Matrix He
Ngl this looks promising.
CGI on LeBrons hair line is amazing
Did I see... fucking Alduin? LEBRON has sided with the dragons! We must warn the jarl!
Went Finding Nemo gets drafted in the NBA
The MJ one is better.
Me: How many references and cameos do u want in this movie  Warner bros: Hmm how about all the best Boomerang, Cartoon Network, and Hanna Barbara characters ever  Me: Shut up and take my money
BLM
look at lemickey man
This is awesome! I can't wait to see it!!
I just hope this doesn't take itself too seriously. Like making the father son dynamic the main deep focus of thr film. Like just keep it light hearted goofy stupid fun. I like the cartoon lebron that's a fun vibe.
I didn’t know LeBron James was such a good actor
Garbage...
nice copy of ready player one but with basketball.
This is well sick omg
Sure hope kids like it!
Lebron seriously considered Superman and Gandalf...
Granny kickball bruh
It'll probably be a decent movie but will never top the original. I don't see any other NBA players in here besides LeBron. The first one had Larry Bird, Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Mugsy bogues and some others. Unless they didn't show any other players in this trailer.
Repent of your sins and turn to God, for the kingdom of Heaven is near. Matthew 3:2  Jesus loves you!
I hope this won't be like will smith's kids karate kid movie
LeBron: I’m looking for my son Me: I’m looking for everyone they put in this movie
Still can’t believe Lebron recasted his own son
RIP Lola
No way I just saw Clockwork Orange
L
1:18 LeGM not even in the trailer for 2 min and already planning the super team😂😭
This is gonna be E P I C
wtf have you done to looney tunes. can I get this movie without lebron james? and what's this ret****d music?
kids don't know or care about looney tunes. they only know about simping for banal girls on twitch. they should change space jam to reflect this new generational change in tastes
LeBron James joins Liverpool ownership group as club confirms RedBird investment. Liverpool owners Fenway Sports Group have confirmed an investment into the company by RedBird Capital Partners, which has seen NBA star LeBron James become a part of the Premier League club's ownership group.        youre welcome.
The Ultimate Showdown was written for this movie
0:56 The fact one of the places on the slot is thundera. Nice  (and)  WB: isn't going to have anymore guns in looney tunes.  Sam: "Im going to 'shoot' this ball with my guns"
Ready player one: basketball edition
all im saying is the name Dom, aint it
Never thought I’d see you again old friend
2:23 Who knew the droogs liked basketball?
If MJ ain’t the Final Boss in this movie, I’m walking the fuck out😭😭
Lebron has the charisma of a sheet of moldy cardboard. The writers, animators and voices of the looney tunes are amateurs and hacks. This will suck so hard.
GOAT
1:47 Animaniacs on the ufo
No
I hate how he not only compares himself to the goat Jordan by takin his number 23 but also makes a movie tht is similar to the real Space Jam smfh
I’m surprised they let Sammity Sam have guns, thought Looney Tunes were sensoring them....
"I am so pumped for Ready Player T-, uhh I mean Space Jam: A New Legacy"😅😂😁
I guess this is where LeBron aggravated his ankle 🙃
What in the ready player one is going on
1:11And just like that, the world became Loonier again.
So the plot is LeBron James rescuing his son Anthony Davis ?
I like the old space jam better
SO MANY BLOODY CAMEOS ITS WRECK IT RALPH 2 ALL OVER AGAIN BUT THIS TIME GOOD
Wait? I thought they nerfed Yosemite Sam's guns?
2841 unlikes from mj fans
Dame Lillard in the movie too 🍿
No no no.. Don't clash with KGF CHAPTER 2 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
That looks awesome this the same thing that they did as the SpongeBob movie.
This looks like pure garbage...
Apparently, THIS is supposed to B part of the DCEU(DC Comics Extended Universe).
Why did you have to remove the original website that was online since 1996? Not cool :/
nobody: not a single soul: wb: you guys asked for it! a space jam sequel!
Warner Bros over all the opposition 🖕🏻😂😤
1:53 seconds... The 1989 Joker.
Toonpur ka superhero in a nutshell.
Mike > Lebron
2:14 Space Ghost in the top right!
Ready Player 2, is that you?
Ready player one but make it the nba
This is not space jam this is ready player one starring the looney tunes none of this makes any sense XD
Ah, didn't think Ready Player Two would be getting a movie that quickly.
So hyped for this movie 👏🏼
well shit this looks BONKERS lol.
They've definitely gone back and tweaked lola since they released that movie poster, she looked like she was legit tweaking before, now shes just nerfed.
Warner Brothers: *Let's ruin their childhood.*
is that Drogon from game of thrones
Classic LeBron. Picking the best teammates to his roster. 🤣🤣
Best trailer so far JK ITS AMAZING I LOVE THE FIRST ONE BUT THIS BETTER BE PERFECT THEN THE FIRST ONE
Yo what!? Everyone is here!? Not only the Looney Toons!? Yo talk about a huge crossover! I'm going be even more surprised if I see the Animaniacs get a cameo here as well! I'm excited for this!
*Yabba Dabba Doo!!!*
Ready Player Two: Electric Boogaloo.
imagine if the black guy landed on the game of thrones world and we have to relive that nightmare final season again
This must be so weird for his real sons
Prime Jordan steps in...
LeBron James suck at acting
I'll glad this time LeBron got animated then Michael Jordan.
I truly believe that Briant was right person for this! He os really successor of Jordan! And i hope in my dreams that we will se him play again!
Warner Bros. Legends Unite!
I was really hoping that they would’ve just made the same movie. It seems that Michael has a better career and movie now
This better have a Michael Jordan cameo at some point !
Looks absolutely ridiculous
I promise you the dislikes are from kids 20 and younger. If you have no nostalgic feel towards this movie AND don't care about basketball you probably see this trailer like... "what?" . It's so much deeper than that though . You have arguably the greatest basketball player of all time in LeBron who's entire career from a teenager was being compared to the other arguably greatest player of all time Michael Jordan who stared in the original version of this movie and shaped a generation. So there is that aspect... then there is the aspect for us who were young and still loved cartoons but also loved basketball and this movie came out and blew our minds.. it's now 2021 and we are getting a remake. .. ahhhh i'm ready.
Can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm actually excited. Even growing on the new Lola design!
Well the world needs Kong,  even space jam
when WB keeps Amber Heard but fires Pepe LePew
Doesn't it feel like film studios are really cross promoting their other properties as much as possible?  Look at all the WB characters in this movie and they did the same thing in the Lego Movie, Lego Batman, and Ready Palyer One.  The novelty of IP's crossing over has become a selling point.
This actually looks good!
Where tf is diana taurasi
That wink was definitely directed towards the Lola fan base
friends, friends: can we all just agree that we are living in the worst possible timeline? i wholeheartedly agree
Looks like Space Jam 2 is taking a good turn this year....
Where the f*ck is Mel blanc
*Qing James The CCP bootlicker
Its going to suck. As I white guy I am offended. There was no white people In the trailer. Black and brown get to be offended, so do we.
Even though this is supposed to be a fun movie, watch ESPN still analyze the hell out of this movie to debate whether MJ or Lebron is the GOAT.
Even though this is supposed to be a fun movie, watch ESPN still analyze the hell out of this movie to debate whether MJ or Lebron is the GOAT.
All the Furry virgins still crying over Lola’s new design... 🙄
This looks 🔥🔥🔥  Can't wait for the games to begin.
This is some kind of the first player to get ready 2 💣🔥😳😱🤯🤩🥰🤤
Welcome to the Space Jam, buds!
Ready Player One is to cinema what AIDS is to the human body
Me at Walmart :  Yeah imma need a 4-8k 3D t.v, your latest home theater setup and  some snack…
So nobody else is mad that lebron turns into a cartoon when he enters the tooniverse? Michael didn't turn into a toon...why would they change this
Sooo stupid.... not remotely interested
Looks like Ready Player One 2 and Don Cheadle's character from The  Family  Man is back.But I'm actually interested!
Ready player one this you?
Rip childhood
It's been 25 years, with the additional  18, since the Looney Tunes characters hit the big screen with Michael Jordan and Brendan Fraser. Now, the torch is passed on to James Lebron to continue their legacy. Hopefully, this will be 10 times better than Warner Bros.' 2021 attempt with Tom and Jerry without a doubt.
Yes
don’t fuck wit that they made Lebron animated
Cancel culture: get rid of Pepe and change Lola's look  Warner bros: ok but where adding a boat load of other things   Cancel culture: wait what  😂😂😂😂😂  I legit feel like thats what they just did they bent the knee but at the same time added other things to make up for it as if they said well for every thing we take out we add 10 more things in wink wink
Jordan fans are gonna have a rough summer when Lebron wins another Ring, his movie wins awards... and he continues his Hollywood brilliance!
pathetic semblance of the original
Bring back the old Lola Bunny design.
Well there goes the Lola of my childhood 😪
Holy shit space jam is back, so much nostalgia
Imma need Travis Scott on the album
Wow. This looks bad.   I guess since Ready Player One was a success, we're gonna see more nostalgia cash grabs designed to make people go "Oh, hey! I remember that thing! I CLAPPED!"
Poor lebron's going to lose a championship yet again.
how many character cameos will there be in this movie?
So he’s in a “server-verse” But the basketball tournament is a space jam    Well thought out. what the fuck are they doing?
Nah
The part that hurts me the most is that this a sequel to space jam when this movie could be called something way different and I wouldn’t mind. These feels like a whole different movie. The old space jam’s feel just isn’t here😔
Best trailer ever,I JUST HAVE TO SEE IT!!
Ngl, I don’t really like it and I’m surprised the comments here are so positive (you do you guys) is this what it feels like to be in the minority of a opinion? Wow
He’s the Greatest Of All Time, don’t be so salty people..
So this confirms that Warner Bros has many earths
LeBron James: Into The Warnerverse
*painfully trying not to remember Nostalgia Critic talking about bunny boobies while watching this*
First Ready player one and now this... please bring back the Iron Giant!
Amazing
god is dead, and Warner Brothers pissed on his grave
Um...K
Let’s hope this could be warner animation group’s grand return to making good films after the Messes that were SCOOB and Tom and Jerry
READY PLAYER ONE MUCH?? THIS LOOKS SICK
It's like LeBron James went into the Oasis from Ready Player One.
Wonderful 🙌🙌🙌🙌💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
nah
lmao I love how Dame has a big clock on his shoulder for Dame Time and Klay is made out of water for the splash bros.
Will the second lockdown take place like last time? And will the situation be the same?..✍️🤔🤔🤔.....sb
Michael Jordan should be here This is gonna be a great movie
Why did they make the Space Jam song less fun? this version sucks
wb, not coming slow this year
I dont like this. The original will always be the best one.  We all know why ;)
2:17 I see Yakko, Wakko, and Dot!
Oh hey. Coogler produced this. No, he's not that old.
oh god no, not the game of thrones world! everyone fucking hates that world now! RUN LEBRON RUN
At 1:50-1:57, they're battling against the elementals (AKA The Doom Squad) Here are the element basketball players in order: Air (or Wind), Electric (or Lightning), Earth (or Stone/Sand), Nature, Water and Fire.
We now know where Kong went after his fight with Godzilla.
WB is hellbent on whoring out The Iron Giant in everything except a sequel apparently
Let’s Gooooooooooo!!!!
I'm sure this was CCP approved.
This looks amazing!
No pepe le pew, no party
why didn’t they put lebrons child AS the child of the movie 😂
Where is Lola Bunny's bobies😡👿
Bruh this is the second time the iron giant had a cameo, so this better mean they are in the works of a sequel.
He just finish getting his ASS handed by Godzilla, and yet Kong is back for this cameo
i wonder who this is supposed to be for. millennials don't give a fuck. kids EXTRA don't give a fuck about old millennial stuff.
If MJ doesn’t cameo in this, he will take it personally.
I was really geared up to hate this movie because...Lebron...needless to say I’m a little out of sorts because this looks too dope.
I don't give a care in the world about LeBron but this movie still looks promising
Love that they're doing a bunch of different styles in animation!
Welcome *BACK* to the Space Jam 🏀
I can’t wait Michael Jordan first one
JUST Y :(
Restore Snyder Verse #RestoreSnyderVerse
"Tell Will Smith I gotta deal with this"
So its Ready Player 2K...get it?  No? Because Iron Giant, but basketball, with a random bad guy, in a computer, and...never mind.
LeBron you'll never be Jordan. Stop trying man
This looks awful as hell
What in the heeeeeck ...!!!! Is WRONG with WB !?!? THIS looks awful.   Another FLOP is coming, is coming, is coming.
This looks insane, can't wait till it comes out
0/10 No Ellis
#restorethesnyderverse
Knew this would be bad but my God this is a train wreck
Ready Player Tune
I hope its good, its going to be hard to beat the OG
Ready Player Two.
Yassssss
Greetings Earthlings, we have now taken over your phone...
They really Nerfed my Girl Lola...
okay but why am i actually hyped for this lol
I never expected that this film would become that big, especially with the crossovers similar to Ready Player One. This film looks like it's gonna be a really silly, fun movie. I can't wait to see the Looney Tunes back in their new, former glory.
one movie that dont need to remake or any new sequel, yup this one.
If Michael Jordan doesn't show up in this movie, im out
Space Jam is secretly Ready Player 2?
Ready Player Space Jam
1:41 ALWAYS The Best Cameo the Iron Giant ❤️
Damm they replaced lebron James sons
Kinda messed up a grandma is thicker than Lola
I'm glad there's actually 2D animation in it.
2:24 RIP June Foray
Ready player one
Bron hair is cgi
not really liking the CG looney toons
1:18 classic 'Bron: assembling a super Team so he has a shot at winning.
🔥🔥YOOO the cameos tho!💯💯 @2:07: The mask, penguin, Fred n dafney by the mystery machine, @2:23 scooby, scrappy, Velma, Ben stiller? @2:25 raidens hat? @2:31 robin? 🔥🔥
I was born in the 90’s so Michael Jordan’s Space Jam will always be my childhood movie. I am sorry but I am not impressed with this trailer. I am glad it is coming on HBO Max because I won’t be paying money to watch in theaters. They also took the classic Space Jam song and just “revamped” it not a good move.
when you  smoke the best weed of your life while watching favourite childhood cartoons.......
I literally can't understand why we couldn't have the old Lola back
The music by Kris Bowers is just epic
Is damian lillard in this to?
Your here King James deal with it
“Everybody get on it’s time to slam now”
This is a must see (not because of LeBron, it's because of daffy duck)... 😂 ✌️
How tf are we supposed to beat to that Lola
This will have to have a soundtrack that stands the test of time. Otherwise it will not be remembered.
Not a strong trailer the first space jam is hand better
1:20  Elmer - Human Lola - Wild Rabbit Wile E. Coyote - Wild Coyote Yosemite - Rooster  Uh...
That was a let down.
Space Jam: Ready Player One - Trailer 1
R.Kelly: (watching in jail) I believe I can cry. I believe I can wipe my eyes. I think about it every night and day Spread my lids and cry away...
Lola bunny😏
Everyone is Twitter world is drooling over Lola 😅
Never thought this would be good but damn it looks good
Before trailer: No way. Dont ruin my child hood.... someone stop this from happening.   After trailer: where is my toon squad jersey.... im going to the theaters... clearing my schedule
0:04 AND THE WARNER SISTER DOT
@2:22 Is that Julian Newman? Ahaha 🤣 😭💀
Acting sucks
Horrible.  No one should torture their family by seeing this trash.
Is that RATHALOS?
I see a couple game of thrones cameos just show two characters screwing in the stands or the boromir beheading and ill be happy
So A Game Of Thrones shares the same universe with Space Jam.
So excited for it.  One of the best things about the original was the MUSIC!!!!  I hope the music doesn't disappoint.
I'll admit, this is the first time in a long time a movie trailer gave me goosebumps.
Who would ever go watch anything with that piece of crap LeBron James
The first Space Jam was amazing (the reason why is not only because Micheal Jordan starred in it) now they’re gonna make a sequel with LeBron James!! I feel like it would’ve been Kobe if he didn’t pass away but I’m definitely watching Space Jam 2 when it comes out
Is it just me or does the 2d animation look less fluid/ less expressive in comparison to the original. It almost looks like it's one step close to being like flash animation to me in some parts, not all but some.
Lebron sucks.
Rest in peace Pepe Le Pew
This looks like it’s going to be a fun movie, but ain’t no way it’s gonna be better than the og
The Space Jam theme just hits differently
Nope I can’t take anymore wtf this super cool!!!!
One word: kwassic 😌
This looks great😁
Oh, will *Nostalgia Critic* flip out if he saw this!!!
Imagine we find Parzival, Art3mis, and then I-r0k in the movie. Then that would make this truly a crossover
This is Corny and LeBron is a Bad Actor, should've picked up some things since he's been in L.A like 3-4 years, and they used King James Lol LeBron's given nickname to himself, I'll call myself GOD if we picking our own nicknames
No no no, pls china noooooooooo
This is more like Warner Bros. The Movie
this isn't space jam this ready player 1 pt 2
They got don cheeto
Looks 🗑
They finnally made the Super Smash Bros movie
amazing can not wait for the king.
1:09 Gear 3rd.. lol!
We need kong the world needs him. Imagine Godzilla showed up that would be cool
Should be pretty good.
Lebron James is now an actor,politician, and officially..a micheal Jordan knock off wanna-be
I'll wait until they make the remake of this movie before I watch it.
Trash
Wow... Absolute trash
Lola is a dissapointment
Didn't laugh once. Another fail.
If Yakko, Wakko and Dot appear in this movie, MY LIFE WILL BE COMPLETE!!!!!!
Lola as dwade XD
Lola girl what have they done to you
TOON SQUAD VS GOON SQUAD
Looks dumb.
So many childhood cartoon characters in here. Oh the nostalgia...
SAVE LOLA BUNNY
nothing compared to the first  space jam..
Lebron’s acting skills remind me of people chewing on tin foil paper.
Hmm...eh
TERRIBLE! Looks so bad!
Buffearon mucho al prota
Ok, I like the fact that it doesn't want to be an exact copy of the original and that it wants to include the WB-verse movies. I'm all in.
Movies have just become a machine to sell nostalgia.
There's so much going on here and I love it!! The nostalgia is a big overwhelming to be honest...I'm 30 going on 7 watching this! Whooooo!! 🏀🏀🏀
I... actually kind of love this.
This looks amazing!!! Can't wait!
Absolutely nobody: Warner Brother's Executives: Hey, let's make a sequel to a movie that came out 18 years ago aimed at children with characters almost none of them will recognize!
Oh, so this is Basketball Tron?
I thought the new matrix movie was gonna be about Neo not Lebron i feel cheated
I found the original one way better #originalgang
It was pretty amazing and I am shocked and excited about that one movie character and all the tv show and tv cartoons characters and so good and I have a NFL Rush Zone Varies and it's just like the college football opener!!!!!!
Marvel is in this! War Machine in like every other shot.
WB: We need to get ppl excited for HBOMax  Screenwriter: I have an idea.
GOT - 0.36 Goosebumps 🔥💥
if bugs bunny doesnt turn into big chungus, im not watching this.
THIS Is Like A Mix Of Ralph Breaks The Internet, AND Ready Player One, With A Hint Of Spider-Man Into The Spider-Verse ALL FUSED Into One BIG UNIVERSE!!!!
This is actually looking pretty good.
They still gonna need MJ’s “Secret Stuff” lmao
I’m DEAD!!!!!!
Me after watching the new space jam movie: " It is a Masterpeace, james. complete. Comprehensive."
This animation and effects is absolutely stunning.
Bugs Bunny: Yo these edibles aint shi-   1:38
I wonder what Michael Jordan thinks about this trailer lol
Does Warner Bros think that the Looney Tunes are rejects?
Why is he lighter as a cartoon?
Gunna be a flop
This look on fire 🔥
Looks like this movie is banking online member berries. Ready player one the basketball game. Nope
Although Lola Bunny has been completely butchered from the one we knew growing up, at least this will prevent another generation of furries ever developing 💀💀.
Still a better story than GoT season 8.  Drogon changed franchise. Well done.
It’s like space jam and ready player One had a baby and I’m loving it
Seeing those Hanna Barbera cartoons reminded me of those old Boomerang days...
The Lebron D Wade alley oop reference is clean asf 🔥
this shit looks fucking horrible!
best movie ever
Yosemite Sam is the man
#restorethesnyderverse
Wait, did Lebron James just pass Game of Thrones planet!? He could have fixed season 8!
Don cheadle captain planet cameo confirmed
Goat James 🐐👑🏆
might be good...well see
Nahhh
They are really trying to force feed the title of king LeBron 🤣 this looks more like a bad spin-off of Ready player one than Space jam
Shouldn’t this be called WB Jam? Not the movie I wanted.
King James??? Hahaha The only King of Basketball is Michael Jordan. I really hope that this movie be good.
Ready Player Two
I can't wait to see this
Saw Yakko, Wakko, and Dot at least three times!
I cant believe they put black iron man in the movie
wait is the point of this movie to show beyond a shadow of a doubt that CGI looks like shit compared to animation? And that modern animation methods also look like shit? i feel sorry for any animator on this project. i mean the paycheck must be nice but this is not good work
I’m still kinda on the fence bout this movie, but honestly it doesn’t look as bad as I thought it would. The IRL Looney Tunes look alright and a cartoon ver. of Lebron seems pretty cool too
This no lola is lolo
excuse me? WTF is this
Boooooooooo this man!!!!
Last was amazing 👍👌😲
Boom this movie gonna bomb 💣  💩☠
I was a bit skeptical because of bad interviews they did. Hopefully it will be fun to watch like the first one.
I grew up watching these old cartoons.  I get a kick out of seeing these characters in a modern setting and their reactions.  Im pleasantly surprised here and looking forward to watching this when it releases.
Wait I've seen this before
1:24 Sam, shoot the ball! LOL!
Yo waner bro lot of people are abusing godzilla vs kong there leaking lot of footage from hbo max please take action
Old one still better, can already tell. Unless they emphasize on the intensity of the team plays and characters moves and give the villains their equal story, it’s gonna be a huge miss.  also they need to make Lola bunny hot again which isn’t gonna happen, it’s not gonna be a home run for any crowd.   Neither kids or parents or even culture fans are gonna be hyped for this garbage. Ya hate to see it
I Wonder if Animaniacs (Live-Action/CGI Film) Trailer We'll Be Coming?
So I seen damian lillard, klay Thompson and Anthony Davis.. who tf kuzma play?🤣
This reminds me of ready player one. Wait Warner bros made  ready player one does that mean ready player one going to be in it too man I can’t wait
Childhood memories all flooding back   THEY ANIMATED MY BOY LEBRON!!!!!!
They ruined the original by putting CGI over the cartoon
They have all these non-Looney Tunes cameos, yet none of them actually play basketball and instead just watch from the audience... *missed opportunity to see Looney Tunes vs. Hannah Barbara*
Damn Granny ain’t playing around.
2:10 10/10
This is going to be great
Two words… Lola bunny
That golden guy near the end looked like Dame lol... or was it just me 😂
Feels like a ready player one semi-sequel
welp this is going to suck really hard lol
I love that it’s got all the different worlds at the beginning starting with him zooming past Westeros
Maybe Space Jam is outdated, but I love it, it was one of my favorite movies when I was younger. My excitement for this is immeasurable!!!
After seeing this... ♪I believe I can fly♪  Also...I wanna see Chuck Barkley play bad basketball again. He doesn't even need to lose his powers.
2:27 Can’t believe they got Kawhi Leonard to be in this too!
WB: *Releases Space Jam 2 trailer*  Michael Jordan: "...and I took that personally."
#restorethesynderverse
So excited for this movie and I love the 2D-to-3D transition on LeBron James and Bugs Bunny.
Not the same first one zill forever be a classic
I actually like all parts of this except the Lebron being a cartoon part, which is fucking dumb. Other than that, actually looks fairly enjoyable.
Granny got some moves 😁
I have to find the Woman now that I'm going to see that with
Mah boy Wayne Knight better be in this.
I thought nets were the villains
More efectt, More censure,More marketing (Nike).
Damn they really canceled pepe
Ready player two 1:40
This movie is really finna be more amazing than others realize!!!!!
Lebron is better in court not on celluloid
It looks pretty good but GOD DAMMIT WHY DID YOU HAVE TO REMOVE PEPE?
Space Jam : Ready Player One
The Monstars were their major opponent. But this new set of Antagonists is something else.
Finally never thought they revived this movie.
Kinda funny that Pepé Le Pew was removed from the film for being too rapey but the guys from A Clockwork Orange are courtside
lebron james acting is horrible
Really went from space jam to "bro. space out with all those effects, they kinda too much"
1:46 IT is in the crowd??! Kinda weird for a Space Jam movie but okay lol
This looks rough. It looks like WB trying to do Ready Player One, but with their own properties, and it comes off as super up it’s own butt
Tune world?
ANIMANIACS IN CGI
Michael Jordan is better than lebron
This looks really good. I'm excited but the cartoon version of LeBron has a much lighter complexion
Okay I will try to get space jam in Wal-Mart
This movie gonna give birth to alot of memes ...
Epicooooo
U can't be a classic man 👍👍👍💯💯💯
Let's be honest here, the ONLY reason we're gonna watch this movie is for Lola, that's it.
1:42 DROGON!!!
Basically ready player one but with space jam included
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!🏀🐰🐰🐰🐰🐰 Space Jam Is Finally Trailer Here🏀🏀🏀🏀⚛️ I Love It ✨
This was awesome.  I watched it like 7 times in a row.
Damn, the only problem is the name,
Mid.
I’m excited about this movie! Enough said.
Gotta give them props for including 2D animation even only for a small part of the movie. It's a dying genre, sadly.
This is a very retarded reboot
Ayo Congrats on ur top surgery Lola!
2:25 Everyone is a Gangsta until the Grandma appears 😂🔥🔥
I like when that unexpected WB caracter appaers
Looks like fun. But also looks like Back in Action still is the better Looney Tunes movie. We’ll see.
YALLLLLL OMGGGG
Can’t wait!!!!!!
Looks like trash tbh
RIP Pepe ;-;
Lebrons acting looks awful
Am I the only one who thinks this looks awful? Why make it so complex? And he’s playing the game bc his son gets kidnapped by the king of the multi verse...bc he wants to play basketball? This just looks stupid 🤷‍♂️
Look how they’ve massacred Lily
War Machine's a bad guy!
Perfecting would be with MJ at the end😭
At least they gave sam his guns back
MJ after watching the trailer: It became personal
WOW!! so lame...
Well, I'm seeing another movie!
Ready Player LeBron
Finally it’s back
I honestly thought the Space Jam remake was about Lebron and the Heat losing to the Spurs in the Finals, then Lebron goes through a tough time, then the Looney Tunes ask for his help in playing a basketball game. Lebron leads the team to victory, realizes how great it feels to win as the star and the good guy and joins the Cleveland Cavaliers again.
Bosko the Talk Ink Kid and Foxy better have cameo in this movie, or I ain’t watching it.
Lebrons acting is worse than Jordans was
That's not Lola Bunny
#not my spcejame
Is this going to be similar to the scoob movie, because this movie feels like a cinematic universe movie.
Finally a movie I want to see!
Didn't see Ready player one, don't think i'm gonna see this one. But gotta admit, the whole Warner multiverse thing going one is interesting.
Dam I gotta love seeing the Iron Giant again... but then again this Iron Giant model is from Ready Player One
2:23, I see Blue Falcon, Cheetara, Lion-O, Scooby-Doo and the Gang, who else do you see? 1:43, I see characters from Hanna Barbera: The Flintstones, The Jetsons, Captain Cvaeman, Yogi Bear, characters from Smallfoot, 1:47 I see Space Ghost, King kOng, Frnakenstein Junior, 1:53, I see JabberJaw, creatures from the Herculoids, The Joker (Jack Nicholson) 1:45 I see It Pennywise, Mr Freeze (Arnold Schwarxenegger), Agent Smith and the Agents, A Flying Monkey.
This is so much better than soul
I did not see a single asian person in the trailer. Its not inclusive enough and i deem this to be racist.
I just wanted to say.....................bye Michael Jordan bye!!"
The original plot made more sense.
My jaw hit the goddamn floor when I saw "The Iron Giant".
1:40 Can't wait to see Iron Giant, Drogon and Kong working together XD
At 2:23 you can see the night king, the scooby gang, the droogs from clockwork orange and Cheetra in the same shot.
Would be better without "oppressed Le Bronda"
what happened to the i believe i can fly :(
0:28 lol be honest who sayed this after the trailer
Why is it called Space Jam if it’s inside a computer...
0:48 Don Cheadle Time! Get extra black on them! Burn Hollywood, burn!
Producer: How's the Space Jam sequel coming along Writer: uhhhhhh I don't have anything Producer: what's the last movie you've watched Writer: Well I just saw Ready Player One, so let's just put LeBron and the Looney Toons in that Perfect!
Alright people *grabs magnifying glass and basket* Who’s ready to go _easter egg hunting?_
FINALLY, WE WERE BEEN WAITING FOR LONG TIME AND THE 1ST MOVIE WITH MICHAEL JORDAN WAS DAMN GOOD YEAH!!!!! 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁✊✊✊✊✊✊✊✊✊✊✊✊✊✊✊✊🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀
Wanna sprite cranberry?
Rip my nigga pepe le pew
2:24 Mystery Gang
not gonna lie....this looks terrible and cheap
The fact that LeBron can actually emote with his face, already makes him a better actor than Michael Jordan.
1:37 *Oh no there's gonna be a real life cgi bugs bunny*
Even through basketball, she gets a senior discount
1:46 I guess Pennywise is here for LeBron's kid as well...
Ready player two: nba jam
No authenticity. No heart. 1st one had it all. Crazy flashy graphics, that's all.
I don't know I'm not feeling it
Awesome
Sonequa Martin-Green is in Warner Bros.? So I need she playing Vixen on a DC movie pleaseeeeee
alex and his droogs wtf
Looks shit
poor acting
I just hope there's a Michael jordan cameo in this
This is important! Does *ANYONE* see the Animaniacs?!!!
Man the sequel to ready player one looks great!
They made the Tunes 2D animation so flat and jank that I actually hope they’re 3D for most of the movie.
ready player one with some famous cartoon characters.
Lebron perfect for this role. He's been practicing his acting  on the court for over 15 years!!
This is so terrible.
just give us the iro robot sequel already.
By the way the reason why King Kong is in this it's meant to be a reference to Kong skull Island and Godzilla vs Kong but also the Kong animated series which by the way I'm not referring to the one that they're actually making I'm referring to the legit animated series made after the Zilla animated series just look up Kong animated series
i didnt know kawhi was in the move also
It would’ve been better if he said “I bet Michael Jordan ain’t got to deal with this” at 0:18 hopefully it’s in the final cut but I still watch it
Was interested then the Looney Tunes turned 3d
Jordan is still better;)
Oh yeah this gone be fire
Welcome to nostolgia the movie
I'll send this trailer straight to my cringe collection
Holy fucking shit it looks epic! It's not just the Looney Tunes this time we've also got all of Hanna-Barbera, DC, and my Big Bois Iron Giant and King Kong!!! I loved Space Jam as a kid I watched it so many times on VHS! Now I have it on Blu-ray and I still watch it to this day! I've been waiting for this movie for a long time and I'm so glad it's finally almost here! I'm so hyped!   Unfortunately,we got like a techno remix of the Space Jam song, which I'm not really feeling! I'm not impressed with it at all!   The original opening song was so awesome that I had hoped they'd have a song just as awesome, or just back the original. But instead they remixed it for the modern generation of music and it's horrible!
This looks like shit...lol
cant wait to see a bit of the ol' in and out and ultra violence, maybe the droogs will get all Singin' In The Rain on the Goon Squad
Lebron Was Never The Right Choice To Make Another Space Jam Movie 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Who else is hoping to see a Harry Potter cameo? 👉👈
YOOO!!! EVERYBODY IS IN SPACE JAM!! SCOOBY-DOO! THE FLINTSTONES YOGI BEAR, JABBERJAW KING KONG, THIS IS LIKE MY DREAM  CAME TRUE! I'll See Y'all in July 16th!!
Well, I guess it will make money
Wondering what shoes would LeBron  make for the movie new shoes
Vou assistir pirateado mesmo Já que não tem o Pepé Le pew
Still trying to be like Jordan 🙄
Me:  What is the purpose of this movie? Hollywood: ...... Well .... Money!
Everyone talking about ready players two and lola but no1 talking about granny apparently being a former Olympic gymnast with her skills
still trying to figure out why they put a bunch of rapists in a kids movie
looks so much fun....
B O O M,  Y O U  L O O K I N G  F O R  T H I S ?
How many cameos and references do you want?  Warner Bros: yes
Welcome to the space jam
It looks so good, the CGI and Animation is all good...but at the same time at the back of my Brain, someone is reminding me about a helicopter crash...
Not gonna lie, this looks pretty good.
Lebron vs the monsters, aka the nets
I can't  wait   and  also  can we get the " Nance cut "  for this too ?
just thinking of all the meme templates this movie is going to make
New movie looks good, but I’m disliking that they remade the song like it was classic but whatever.
2:01 to 2:05 the BGM reminds me of KGF movie
Lol WB will do a crossover with this but wants to throw out the DCEU  #RestoreTheSnyderVerse
2:10 Dwayne Wade reference?
hmmm, It does what I was afraid of, explaining the toon world as some kind of "VR domain" or something, I mean in the original the cartoon world just existed?
With this and the Lego Batman Movie, it seems like Warner Bros just really loves flexing all their properties, but if it means we get to see Gandalf dunking on the damn Yogi Bear, I’m down
I saw Pennywise and when Bugs Bunny is changing he is rocking the OG Tune Squad Tee.
why does the 2d animation in this look so much worse than it did 25 years ago?
Let’s be honest.. #22 Bill Murray is what we all want.
Didn't like the 1st 1. So I doubt Ima like this 1.
The Animaniacs/Pinky and the Brain BETTER have a speaking cameo in this movie
Where's AD?
I like how King Kong is in the trailer
This is craaaazyyyy
The goat
The 2D animation...was surprising!
This actually looks pretty good.  MJ better make a cameo.
Another example of lebum chasing Jordan whom he will never pass. Shouldn’t even be a conversation but there’s so many blind witnesses out there as Skip says lol
This movie already looks Ass
This has got Ready Player One written all over. I hope Lola Bunny should get her own movie one day. It should be more of a fully cgi prequel to Space Jam!! Not to mention the tables are completely turned for the Looney Tunes to help LeBron get his son back!?!?
LeMicky  tried the mj dunk and jumped into the wall. guess only the goat can do that
It actually looks worse than I thought it was going to look, and I thought it was going to look bad. I hope cancel culture cancel this atrocious movie 🤣
Lebron James: Wants to hire Superman and Gandalf on his Basketball Team Micheal Jordan: Defeats Monstars with Bill Murray and Newman from Seinfeld
0:35 did anyone else saw the game of thrones’s logo?
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
DROGON !!!!
I like Lebron James but his acting is so bad lol. Still gonna watch it.
Unnerf lola bunny
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
This will be the greatest movie of all time
I wanted to say hwlow bad this looked and was going to suck, being that space jam was my childhood movie but damn this actually look good. I'm impressed
Senior discount 😂😂
First it was aliens and now cyber verse
Bruh I need micheal Jordan to make an appearance in this movie
It looks cool... If it were another series. Like this looks like it belongs to something else. It's less cartoony and more video game-esque
Does anyone else now want to go watch the original one again now? LMAO
Eh
Awesome!!!!! So excited for this!!! :D
This trailer: LSD
I was kind of hoping they would have someone from the MonStars on the Looney Tunes team since they became Looney Tunes after the first movie. Would have been cool to see them return. Hopefully it's a surprise cameo.
This looks like ready player 1 and I'm in
The worlds worst trailer in the whole wide Galaxy
Stan podolak best be his agent
So EVERY Warner Bros. property takes place in the same universe? Good to know, Spades Jim: A Nude Pegasus
Where are Pepe Le pew and Speedy González???
The fact that King Kong's there make's me wanna see the movie really bad
LOOK AT LEBRON MAN.
Ruining a Classic 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
It looks horrible
Bro where my pimp pepe lepew at
Gtfoh!
Leave it to LeSchmuck to ruin Space Jam...
well maaaaybe i'll go see it. not making any promises....
I was hoping for space Jam, but got crappy over dramatic ready player Jam instead... (sigh)
IDK about yall but I’m not feeling the storylines about the dusty kid getting kidnapped by an amazon server
LeBron’s non-Oscar worthy acting though 🤣🤣
Thank you MJ
2:23 - Even the Droogs from "A Clockwork Orange" are in there.
I really hope they paid for all those likes...
I really hope that the theaters reopen before this comes out
I’m grinning so hard!!
The entire Warner multiverse watching a basketball game of Looney Toones and LeBron James, sold.
Not gonna lie when this was first announced I was angry and scared that they will ruin a fan favorite movie and concept but now watching this it honestly doesn't look like it's gonna be that bad. Let's wait and see
Looks like hot garbage! Nothing can beat Space jam with Michael Jordan.
good to see iron giant he deserves his own movie  like tansformers
Yo this trailer is ass
This is Warner Bros' answer to Disney's Wreck It Ralph 2: each flexing their own huge library of IP's.
Feeling the Read Player one vibes
Let’s go!
Personally I probably won't watch it since I'm older now and it doesn't appeal to me, but it looks great for this generation of kids who grew up with Lebron as their MJ
This is a slap in the face to the original.
Don Cheadle Word of The Day : Slam
1:14 trailer should’ve ended right there
I’m calling it Lebron is coming back from a 3-1 lead
At 1:46 I'm guessing now that Pennywise decided to start eating Looney Tunes instead of children now? LOL
This movie looks so dope🔥
July 16 🗓📌👊🏼
Scooby-Doo, Yogi Bear, The Flintstones, THE IRON GIANT!???
Yessirskiii! Can't wait for this movie!
@0:36 Game Of Thrones!?!
Yese finaly. Can’t wait !!!
Well I enjoyed the movie.
THE IRON GIANT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Not impressed...
Not as bad as I thought, not a fan of China-simp Lebron but meh
Nah
Still better than the Suicide Squad trailer.
This looks like junk food material, just like the first movie. A bad movie that's easy to enjoy
She looks entertaining, but the truth a little forced the plot
1:46 YAY we’re going to see Pennywise.
WOW that looks bad
Should’ve just stuck with the original smh
Summary: iron mans friend kidnaps football stars son and tells him the only way to get him is to play football with a bunch of loony toons characters and a gamer grandma.         *k.*
Fineally its happening
Iron Giant Cameo <3
Is it just me or is LBJ having a dmt trip
What a horrible soundtrack
I saw yogi bear and Fred flintstone
Why does AT&T/WB constantly have to remind me of their intellectual property? Like damn we all know it’s kinda cool when you do this shit but you’ve already done it multiple times before this.
Hmmmm🤨
Yup, this will suck
Oh this is amazing and beautiful love it
who is excited for this movie
Ready Player 2 featuring LeBron
This look seriously amazing, it's been some time since i felt that, i hope this lives up to my expectations 🔥🔥🔥🙏
I'm just happy to see Jabberjaw bruh!
Ready Player Two looks okay so far...
Finally So exciting 😍
Everything is good it’s just the plot is the same like every movie that they have to go save there son
Suck trailer for kids movie
So vamoooo
Space jam when Lebron jams it in space idk I didn’t watch the movie🤷‍♂️
Kong seems to enjoy this "Hollow Earth" so much
As a Looney Tunes fan and an aspiring animator, I love that they brought back 2D animation for cinema and gave a plot point for the shift to CGI. It's clever. I'm just glad they didnt do CGI out right. Can't wait to see this movie ^^
Lebron Jaaaames
They really put the scoob characters in here
No one:  Furry: *writes sign:”LOLA BUNNY ISN’T HOT ANYMORE, DON’T WATCH THIS MOVIE”! *hangs sign on movie poster
This better be good!
No Korey Coleman on this sequel? 0/10    Nah Jk 🤣.
#restorethesnyderverse
That "Shoot the ball" joke had me howling.
Where is Detective Pikachu?????
Woah why does this look like ready player one
Amazing basketball player, but god damn this fool can’t act 😭😭
Also..YOU HAD SHUN OGURI ON YOUR ENTERPRISE, PLEASE JUST PUT GINTOKI ON THIS MOVIE TOO.
brooooooo literally stole this from ready player 1
Cant wait to see double toasted talk about this!
R.I.P. Pepe le pew
Remind me of Michael Jordan been kidnapped by cartoon to fight aliens haahaha
Bugs Bunny: Eeh whats up doc Everyone: He said it! He said the thing!
Space jam a new legacy in cinemas july15th coming soon on theaters
So LeBron James is married to Sonequa Martin-Green, his arch-enemy is Don Cheadle, and his universe is the entire Warner Brothers library being given the Ready Player One treatment. And I am here for it.
You know what I just realized      This has nothing to do with space 😂
c o m e  o n  a n d  S L A M
Can’t wait to see Dame in this
The book was better
GET YOUR GOD DAM VACCINE SO I CAN SEE THIS IN THEATERS
Why did I start tearing up 😭we’re getting old .
Looks generic af
Space Jam is good... But, man..this thing, its not Space Jam. ITS WARNER BROS LEGACY.
im still not forgiving you for what you did to lola.
Ready player who?
This about to be gooooooood
This is the tru multiverse
1:46 pennywise? 2:18 The mask?
Omg! If you are not a fan of looney tunes you are not a fan to watch this movie then! This movie is going to be soooooooooo good can’t wait
So it's more of a Ready Player One sequel but starring LeBron and the Looney Tunes.
Looks like crap
#RestoretheSnyderVere
*Glad Tweety made it into the trailer...* @2:17
We got the MCU, Legendary's Monsterverse, and now we got the Warner Brosverse? All we need is the HBO Verse.
This looks really good actually, did not expect that.
The soundtrack is awsome! This looks promising
this actually looks kinda sick
Wait if the iron giant is back in this movie...     DOES THIS MEAN WE GET TO SEE OSMOSIS JONES TOO?
I'm expecting three things: A MJ cameo, some sort of Kobe tribute, Daffy making a flopping joke
“Boom, you lookin for this?”
Anthony Davis at 1:52
I love it king James!  But on a side note  #restorethesnyderverse
Lets go King LeBron James
WB UNIVERSE HAVE TO MUCH POTTENTIAL YOU CAN MERGE IT WITH DC UNIVERSE
I was never a fan of the original feature, much of the opposite hair on my head 'Space Jam' was nothing more than a worse version of 'Roger Rabbit', but this one I even think it can be "cool".
0:32 la mejor parte
So literally this is Ready player one but with bad acting plus lebron.
Monstars better make a cameo, along with others too.
movies these days..
Bad.
Yesssirrrr I’m signing up for the HBO Max free trial come July 16th lmao
I saw R2 and that Wolverine in the background!
At 1:46 you can see Pennywise on the very right hand side
Michael Jordan when he sees this trailer:   "Ready the armada, we will use the old ways..."
Cant wait JL x Space Jam
1:20 - 1:22 I was really expecting to see Daffy's full name, Daffy Sheldon Duck!
Bugs looks 4K as hell.
Hey will you guys boycott a game if the police shoot a guy wanted for multiple sexual assault charges. Remember that lebron?
yall took out peppy but left actual rapists in the movie??!!?  2:23 #alexdelarge
We got the friggin Droogs as spectators, but Pepe Le Pew is the one banished to PC hell. Bruh.
The ending should have Jordan come up to James in the the Tune world as his young self and say "Lets end the GOAT conversation once and for all"
I am excited to see all these characters in live action
Honestly looks good but people gonna hate regardless.
Let’s see how this kind of movie is good as the first movie of Space Jam.
Look what you did Barry!!
Only Lebron would want a team that has superman iron giant and godzill....what am i saying i would done the same also
Let the games begin!!!!
OMGGG
So its tron now?
Type of animation they used aside, this is looking good 👌
Oh, I remember this guy, he said Morey is either misinformed or not really educated on the situation.
I teared up 😂 MY CHILDHOOD 😭
Let the games BEGIN!
The fucking first shot is his MANSION, cringe
I'm sure Michael Jordan will get a mention, I just Brendan Fraser gets some love too.
My god, this is horrible.
Ayee they got my boi Kong in there
Dang already at 600k
1:53 joker in the background
Or avengers infinity war right ;)
Warner Bros: Releases the New trailer for Space Jam Disney: Where is that goddamn Trailer for Black Widow??
how bout no
1:17 I love how he's writing names from warrior brothers movies.
Something tells me Looney Tunes is part of Barreraverse somehow. Or is it?
Lmaooooo they threw in lebrons iconic dunk but it’s with Lola bunny 😭😭😭😭😭
Looking like a double wide surprise.....      _God damn_
LeActor
Where kyrie😢
All I wanna hear is "Looking like a double wide surprise".
Don chaedle ballin left and right. Went from disney world to warner bros
I’m so excited for this movie! LET’S GOOOO!!!
This trailer is the epitome of "Style over Substance"
Really not feeling it, to each their own. I really like it when movies or series tried building on their own. Rather than including every possible character imaginable. I'll just buy the original Space Jam.
U know what.........that looks FUN! Im in
wheres the boobas
... Okay, I'm sold. The 2D parts looks amazing and the use of CGI versions of the Looney Tunes make sense with the transition between "realms". I also love the way this pays homage to the first film but it's still doing it's own thing and adding new elements such as the WB franchise multiverse aspect. Having Lebron dropped in with the rejects (the Looney Tunes) through the classic tunnel accompanied by that classic tune... Now that's a story transition that makes sense! The first movie is a guilty pleasure for me. This looks like it could be a genuinely good film. Also, Sam gets to use his guns again!
AH THE ANIMANIACS HAVE BEEN SPOTTED-
Meh, what's up doc.. classic ❤️
Man this brings back a lot of memories. Really looking forward to this.🔥
btw rest in peace for pepe le pew for being removed from this and warner bros company
I like how the characters we actually grew up with are barely included but Lola the Bunny and Lebrons family occupy most of the trailer
I miss Pepe le Pew  and Speedy Gonzales #bringpepelepewback #bringbackspeedy
Spoiler Alert: Le fraud  is going to scratch his arm, pretend  like he's  been hit by a car and roll on the court holding his arm while crying. Then micky is going to give him 2 free  throws which will allow him to win the game.
They should of stucked with mj no cap but it looks like a good movie tho
The next most ambitious crossover ever, can’t wait to see day 1
WOW! Is 🔝
He reminds me of LeBron James
Soooooooooo tron remake?
🙏🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍
It's a crossover! I love it!
LeGM LeChoke LeFlop LeActor LeGoat
He should have added Goku in his team 🤦‍♂️. Would have won so easily!
1:21 Yosemite Sam isn't a Rooster...?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Space Jam 2: The Homosexual/Black Lives Matter Edition.
This will be a disaster
Trailer made me want to see it!
I'm more focused on why iron giant hasn't gotten a sequel yet its had 2 crossovers.
LeGM LeChoke LeFlop LeActor
1:52 Look at the guy dressed in purple on the right.  This truly says a lot about our society
#restoretheSnyderVerse
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
2:10 I understand that reference
Give us back pepe and Lola's original body
Super Warner Bros Ultimate
I mean, Mike couldn't act worth a shit but Lebron is literal cringe
This looks like trash... another thing Jordan is the GOAT at
Where’s Penelope Pussycat?
This is so trash.
Ready Player One: The Basketball Game
1:42 Is that a Hungarian Horntail?
1:45 PENNYWISE ON THE RIGHT
That senior discount tho👍😂
pause at 1:46 to see pennnywise
OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
I'm hoping for a Scorpion cameo in this where he yanks the ball away from Lebron with his classic "Get over here!"
This look like shit
*Sees Lola Bunny*  Look how they massacred my boy
Lola Bunny, awakening strange thoughts and feels in a whole new generation.
I feel like that team is missing a skunk 🦨
Yoo Mama! Taco TUES!
Looks shit
Looks ok, I guess. I'm not a huge fan of the 3D characters, though.
1:47
Song is Scylla - RL Grime Did my head in finding it coz I recognised it immediately though it's remixed/edited for the trailer.
This is just amazing 🤩😍☺
SICK
This is actually sad to see, lebron could've never ran with the bad boy Goat is a title he hasn't earned smh
Unpopular opinion: Shoulda been Blake Griffin
This looks amazing, cant wait
Honestly, i expected Lola Bunny keeping her style from the first movie.  2:11  😥
#RESTORETHESNYDERVERSE
They're trying so hard to be Ready Player One here.. wtf.
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos🔻
Ready player one?
#RESTORETHESNYDERVERSE
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
I pray Bugs turns into Big Chungus at one point!
This film better explain where Pepe Le Pew is, instead of just leaving him out of the movie.
Okay damn, this looks awful
Wait, the server room is inside the virtual reality?
Well now we know what rhodey is doing
W
This is kind of a weird adaptation of Ready Player Two but it looks better than the book
HYPED SO MUCH!!!!!!!
😭😭👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
All I need is Daffy Duck trying to ride Drogon and I’m sold for life🔥🔥
Where’s Pepe?
That was freaking awesome
When Bugs Bunny started rendering in 3D I got Sonic flashbacks **shudder**
Production on Ready Player Two seems to have taken a wild turn
Even on the movie LeMickey trying to get the chip...sadly there is not ADisney to carry his overrated ass
That’s not lola bunny
*And the Oscar award go to*  *Space jam a new legacy*
Lola ain’t allowed to wink at me anymore
Lebron creating a SuperTeam I’m not surprised lol
This doesnt make any sense, what about the first spaceman, and aliens, now it's just a different part of the looney toons galaxy in which it doesnt matter becuase theres more universes
1:53 | Joker is invited, I hope they didn’t invite Batman too
1:41 Is that Drogon from Game of Thrones ???
Its amazing
I’m old enough to remember when the original space jam came out. And after seeing this trailer im looking forward to watching this. Only thing i hate is the uniforms lol
Va estar espectacular! Solo miren esos cameos, nunca me había emocionado tanto por una película 😵🥴
Don's character really called lebron clown to the rejects like dude he was in nba 2k waddaya mean his a rejct
Would be cool if they 'remember' the episode with MJ in the script. I saw no reference is made to that.   Otherwise cool. Too bad Kobe didn't make one too.
Ngl... had my doubts when they first announced this movie but I’m definitely going to see it now!
That dwade reference was Legendary
You think Tom and Jerry might make cameos?
No thank you
#restoreSnyderverse
Cool! I’m looking forward to seeing this movie.
Love it...love it...love it...love it... really love it.....
Who's the other boy bunny? 🐰
speaking as someone who loves classic animation.... fuck this nonsense
Space Jam going all Ready Player One on us, huh. I can dig it. Bron is gonna get nominated for a Razzie though, for sure. 😂
I don't want to feel nostalgic anymore 😥
1:38 I'm glad that old jersey made an appearance.
Wouldn't watch it if you payed me too... lebron is a racist and worships china.
Awesome!!
I never expected to see Alex DeLarge and his thugs as part of the audience at 2:23
Kong? K O N G?! Did i see Kong?
So. Many. Characters.
Awesome🔥😎
Steven Spielberg: oh no, hold my better crossover...
This looks good!
Also, the old lady Granny got some moves! 😀👍
No
Why does lola look like that?
Woohoo waiting for this one❤️
#RestoreThesnyderverse
Im suprise no one is memeing Bronny for getting replaced by "Darius" lol  Though it would have been to cool see Bronny and LeBron in a movie, you should have stayed out of trouble Bronny
So its confirmed will smith is canon in the space jam universe
Lola Bunny :((((
0:35 reference game of thrones
BORING
#restoreTheSnyderVerse
LeGM didn't sign Godzilla? Watt
Holy crap was that the mask at 2:19 on the right of the crowd
Hold up Pennywise is here 1:46
Iiiissshhh, I know this is a kids movie, but why do people keep thinking that kids are dumb, this is way to colorful, my 8 year old nephew saw this trailer and said it looked dumb
Epic! 😁😁👍 I can’t wait to see the Looney Tunes get up and slamming once again! It is good to see the old gang after the first movie came out way back in 1996 (I know Pepe LePew won’t be in it, but his “lover” Penelope Pussycat will be). Also, I can briefly see Bugs wearing the original “TuneSquad” white jersey before changing into his newer blue updated jersey when transferring into his 3D form.
Space Jam is about the Looney Tunes, not about EVERY character of the Warner Bros.
Not my Lola!
Solomon Hill is the villain
ready player one jam??? and where is pepe :(
Looks horrible
This looks INSANELY GREAT!!!
Well got damn!! This is the BIGGEST crossover film since Marvel Cinematic Universe films.
Endgame: Biggest crossover Space jam: Hold my carrot doc
01:46 mystery machine from Scooby doo
A lot has changed in 25 years lol. Hearing that music brought back fond memories of watching the first film!
NO BLOODY HELL! PEPE LE PEW HE IS NOT HERE >:-(
https://youtu.be/kFN3l2NuoE0
Warner: How many characters do you need? Director: Yes
Whoa, Granny got some style!
Yet another thing Jordan did better than Lebron.
Where’s Marvin?
What's up with WB doing these glowy rainbow color themes. This is already done with WW 1984.   Ooh! And btw. Who the f*ck came up with that name? Wonder Woman *1984* which was released in 2020.
Can’t wait for the Easter egg videos breaking down this one 👏🏾
I'm surprised: sports players are usually HORRIBLE at reading any type of script, even for commercials, but Lebron actusllt seems into it! Movie doesn't look half bad either
my eyes
Whaaaaaaat this is awesome 👁️👄👁️
This is 🗑
Is it just me, or does this feel like somebody shouted at Warner Bros - SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT And they be like - ok
Many scenes have been cut out of this but still so looking forward to this.
Thanks, I hate it.
SPOILER: Brian Scalabrine will save the day.
Absolutely nobody likes Lebron. He doomed his movie career, if he even had one, with his constant ignorant whining about non-existent SJW concerns.
This Looks So AMAZING INCREDIBLE😍
Is it me or is this the same story? NBA player in alt universe, can't get out without playing a game of basketball with the bad guys. MJ is GOAT and the original.
what in the name of all that is holy is this crap. This looks like absolute horse shit.
blesphamy. stop trying to be like MJ.
2:17 🦇 The Bat-signal 1:43 🛸 The Jetsons 1:53 🃏 Jack Nicholson's Joker  2:07 🚌 Scooby, Shaggy, Velma, Fred, Daphne, 🦕Dino, 🎭 The Mask, 🐧The Penguin  2:26 🕺🏻 Phoenix's Joker  2:31 🦸🏻‍♂️ Robin
What kind of knockoff Ready Player One bullshit is this?
I don't know what to think, i think the song chosen for the trailer sucks like it doesn't fit.
2:10 If you know you know
1:12 what if there’s a big chungus cameo??
Is it me or does this look genuinely good?
This feels like Space Jam meets No Game No Life
People like this type of movies?😳
Yo Imagine Godzilla vs Kong in a basketball game
Ripping off Tron!
Aye this finna be crazy😅🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I wonder who lebron will recruit to form a super team to beat this goon squad.... def will need a fully healthy AD
dear warner bros i am so happy for you making this movie i just hope that you are going to release some toolkit animations for us to see for the movie to fill our nostalgia more like live action and animated warner bros characters including the warner animation group and hanna barbera characters meeting the looney tunes characters and lebron james and also i love to see toolkit animations of the goon squad for the movie love your dear friend leon deemer ps keep up the good work
Gotta say, the visuals look great,  Drogan is in this shit. This is going to be thy cheesist shit ever can't wait
At 2:07 On the left, you can see the infamous Mystery Van. Scooby Dooby Dooooo
Why are the Droogs gang from Clockwork Orange at the game?
You know it's bad when you're trying to find nostalgia characters in the background then watching the main characters.
This looks like a YouTube movie. That’s either praise or criticism. You can decide.
All those cameos, im just here hoping bill murray shows up in the 4th quarter
Look at all that bad acting on display already this is gonna be good 😂! No joke these kind of performances have a special place in my heart. Effects look top top notch though , ready player one with more budget maybe.
I thought this was a videogame trailer when I first saw the thumbnail😂
Can't wait to watch Lebron get cramps and then get backed down by Porky Pig.
So what ever happened to the monstars
So is this set in the RPO universe? because this is not only reminiscent of the style of animation and the portrayal of the animated , but RPO is actually a WB property. Like, for all we know, this could just be the mainframe for the universe.
Song?
*This looks like a Russian Movie ripoff that I have seen 🙄*
This movie actually looks kind of amazing. #RestoreTheSnyderVerse #ReleaseTheAyerCut
1:46 Even Pennywise is a basketball fan?
Is this the trailer of TRON part 3?
I hate lebron i dont like this movie will be so different
Wow I can’t wait for this! Seeing all these Warner Bros characters together is pretty cool.
Wonder if we’ll get a MeatCanyon version of Bugs Bunny since this sets up a WB Multiverse 🤔
don cheadle
OH MY GOOOOD !!!!!
Holy pathetic Batman!
This is basically Ready Player One with basketball
Bring back pepe le pew!
Space Jam trailer releases Rule34 artist: I'm speed
I am both worried and enthralled by this.
I think I figured why Marvin isn't there yet. Cause he's in the Oasis in ready player one. He somehow entered there, not as an avatar, if you catch him in the film
1 captain caveman. 2 flintstones. 3 scooby doo. 4 yogi bear and boo boo. 5 the mask. 6 1966 penguin 7 Tim burton penguin. 8 kong. 9 animanicks. 10 iron giant. Those are ten characters I spotted!
I see the following cameos:  Mystery Inc. Blue Falcon Yogi & Boo-Boo The Flintstones Jabberjaw Magilla Gorilla The Jetsons Captain Caveman Penelope Pitstop The Iron Giant King Kong Pennywise Frankenstein Jr. Space Ghost The Mask The Joker The Penguin The Herculoids The anti-social gangsters of A Clockwork Orange Lion-O and Cheetara
They ruined it this doesn’t have to do anything with the original
Trade the "monstars" for the 76ers.(no danny green).
waiting for Lola ;)
Wow...even the trailer was unbearable!
I love how they did cgi on the tunes, and the way they showed granny that no matter the age, you can go old school on a robot's butt.
Lol brings back memories for real for real 🙏🙏💯💯
1:47 is.... is that sherk at the top left corner in the blimp?
Usem mais os personagens dos looney tunes com desenhos, filmes, são personagens incríveis.
He wanted superman , Gandalf , king kong , and the iron giant to be apart of his team lol
Yay, looks like fun, but ummmm....  😤🤳🏼🔥🔥🔥🔥 #RestoreTheSnyderverse
They removed Pepe Le Pew and Speedy Gonzales for ALL THOSE CAMEOS?!?! Okay, objection withdrawn!
Petition for the original movie lola bunny design anyone ?
Why does this feel like Ready Player One lmao
Am I the only one that seen pennywise 1:46
space jam x ready player one
Ready Player One scenario huh? I'M IN!
Can't wait to see Gossamer and Taz in this :) Also at 1:57 Hahaha, I love that gag. Never gets old XD
Nothing will ever beat the original just like lebron will never be better than Jordan.
Ill stick to the first one this looks horrible
If james wasnt such a woke liberal and brings politics into the game and cry after making billions and cry about how his life is so bad from racism and shit but yet makes billions and has millions of supporters i would sit here and watch this. Never once do I remember jordan complain bc he shut up and played.
Porque no salió godzilla pinche toho 😡
1:46 The clown Pennywise
I seen few of characters from Smallfoot
The 90s kid in me is excited for this.
my favorite cartoon
2:23 is that the Knight King from Game of Thrones?
Cringe af 🤮
This looks bloody awful
LJ = MJ for the poors,
We better get one of those sick intros like Jordan had
Boom, you lookin for this?
Look how they massacred my Lola 😭
So let me this straight this all starts with a kidnapping of a kid? 🤔🤦🏻‍♂️
You lost me in the 2nd half so much
0:33 Lebron looking for teams he could get more rings with
Its literally Ready Player Two
I changed my mind, this looks insane. The Lola assist to Lebron dunk, she winks, you know that's a reference to the D Wade Bron poster assist. That made me smile a lot! That and the iron giant
Trash
No Jordan, not movie for me. And movie looks too colorful. btw, its terrible what they did with Lola.
Come on and SLAM and welcome to the JAM
C'mon can't we get a camo of the mon squad from SJ 1
1. Why is the grandma has more curve than lola in this trailer?! 2. Why do they bring god shaggy in this game if they want to balance the villain?! 3. Isthat drogon (the khaleesi dragon from GoT) and why is it there?!
Already better than the original one 🔥
I love you... WB...
This is an embarrassment to the original.
Music: go body slam Plays  Me: where are O&S ??
This looks pretty dope
i think rhodey is on the wrong movie ? 😁 or maybe waiting for the armor wars 😁 cant wait to see this movie !!!!!  #KINGJAMES !!!!
Lit 🔥
I am watching this movie
why didn’t you make rabbits black it’s not tolerant everyone should be black why did you take white people into the crowd they oppressed you all should be black and in the arena everything should be painted in BLM colors forbid white oppressors to go to the cinema
This is outrageous and I love it!!! 🥴
The visuals are awesome
Ladies and gentlemen...let the games Begin!,
Lebron James acting looks aight
NICE
How come Granny never got to play in the first movie?
Awful
I want a new story line
They had me at “what’s up doc?”
The only good side of monopolistic intentions of movie industry
Ready player two?
LEBRON JAMES AKKA JORDAN DADDY INCOMING....ITSSS TIMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE .....!!!!!!
dangggg, i actually feel excited bout this
I'm just here for the Iron Giant cameo
They sure do know how to make a trailer
That was nice!
Everything except the granny bit at the end was pretty cool. Also the 3d render for Bugs and the gang may feel a little unnecessary..
Looks corny...
Penny wise at 1:46
Imagine kingdom heart with WB character
ad is one with wings, dame with that metal body and klay with the fire and water
Ummmmm wtf was that tweetie voice, my boy on menthols?
What did Bugs do to Marvin?!?!?! He better be in this movie and have a big role!!!! He was only referee in the 1st film. He better be hiding somewhere and shows up for the climax or something!!!!
DON CHEADLE GCYVSXIUNGBXUYGA
is it ginna be in the theaters cause i got money on me
Lebron looking like he about to flop
0:45 there is Matrix world
Well I'll won't be watching this shit. Original was way better
No good movie or plot here just nostalgia bait I see. So glad we don't need a good script anymore.
Meh
Give it up, fooooooor LeBald James!
Critical Race Theory in action. No white people are allowed in the movie. Typical Ryan Coogler rassist crud.
Is Granny a retired russian olympian?
That was hard to watch. This will flop harder than Lebron James in a playoff game.
The visuals look stunning 🔥🔥
Disney: Endgame is the most ambitious crossover movie ever  Warner Bros: Hold my basketball.
When the movie looks good
This is the BEST trailer of the year hands down can’t wait for this
Not gonna lie, Ready Player Space Jam looks kind of good.
This is gonna suck.
Looks good to me. Looks like space jam 2021
Came here just to check out Lola Bunny, who else?
Wait where's Godzilla
What is this? Looks more like a basketball “Ready Players One” sequel than a Space Jam sequel. Glad I get to watch this for free on HBO Max cause this is certainly not worth a theatre viewing
I really hope the LEGO movie franchise characters will make crowd appearances in space jam: a new legacy!
No matter how many characters or awesome moments this will never live up to the first sapcejam
Fun fact: Haters gonna watch this movie. That's for sure! 😂
It’s just ready player one and basketball
2:10 the iconic miami heat dwayne wade pose while lebron dunks !!
Finally, Lebron can show off his garbage flopping skills. Lol
they nerf lola.. sadge
lola looks bad
Why couldn’t his real son play in the movie
Can't wait see this I'm soo excited see all cameos from wb and dc universe  I love the original movie growing up
Are we gonna see RWBY characters in this because Warner Bros owns Rooster Teeth?
I saw The Mask at 2:07 and 2:18, glad to see him again after 20 + years Sssmokin!! 🌪😁
Seems pretty well made!
It’s missing Pepe Le Pew and Speedy Gonzalez 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
*2:10** Lola pulling the DWade lob is INCREDIBLE! 😬🤟🏾*
Kong after KVG: Time for some BASKETBALL!!! WO WOOO
Not watching it they mess up LOLA BUNNY ‼️🏀
Bro they just brought out the whole Warnerverse in one movie. Everything from the old school to the new. Oh this movie is a must see. 25 years since the first.
OMG QUE PÉSIMO ACTUA EL TIPO. ESTE ERA UN CLÁSICO QUE NO DEBÍA TOCARSE
Big *NAAAAAHHHH*
The whole movie in a single trailer
My boy drogon here lol
I might be the odd one out but I don't like this at all compared to the original,  at least the original had a good plot why the Goon Squad were so good etc
It’s even better than I imagined and anticipated 😃 So going to see this movie
Ah ready player two is looking interesting
Space Jam>Space Jam A New Legacy
I miss The Pepe Le pew 😭😭😭 Malditos canceladores de internet
This is like Ready Player One and Ralph Breaks The Internet all rolled into one! I cannot wait for this and I'm totally seeing in theaters!
Wait! Why does Granny have a walker? She never needed one before
I hope we see the animaniacs in the audience! I know I saw Scooby-Doo  :)
Ready Player Jam
Iron Giant just sold me Nice play, Warner.
realistic Buggs Bunny makes me more scared than realistic sonic
GENERACIÓN DE CRISTAL LARGO DE AQUÍ. TODO LO QUE VEN O TOCAN LO HACEN 💩💩💩💩💩 #JUSTICIAPORPEPELEPEW
I guess King James is trapped inside Warner Bros IP server
That green screen omg
Ready player...for basketball 😎
WELCOME TO SPACE JAM BRO it does look inside Ready Player One Movie playing basketball.
Jordan beat the Monstars with Bill Murray and Newman but LeBron needs Superman, Gandal, the Iron Giant AND King Kong?? GOAT debate OVER
When Cartoon Worlds Collide also The Sever Verse looks *AWSOME*
I bet Skip Bayless already hates this movie.
Ready player one with looney tunes
I think Space Jam 2's title should've been "Space Jam 2: Nex Gen"
👏 Beautifully made trailer, truly The Matrix  x Looney Tunes in 2021
It could been better the director didn't cut pepe le pew.
Where is big chungus
no thanks
2:11 Ahhh yes...
“How many cameos do you want?” “Yes.”
More like ready player two.
Looks bad
Meh
I was really excited but I think I’ll probably pass unless it’s free for HBO max which my phone company pays for this just don’t look all that
I thought his son would be played by Bronny Jr
Space Jam was my Childhood in so many ways. I watched the VHS tape so much it's a miracle it didn't wear out. This looks like it's gonna be a great Sequel and WB, thanks for keeping the music from the most adrenaline fueling opening in history
So are these events also canon to Shut Up And Jam Gaiden?
Whoever thought lebron could carry an entire movie as the lead needs to be punched. The goon squad?? This is one movie that didn’t need to be remade.
I see Damian Lillard...it's lit🔥
Post credits they gonna add Bronny getting his cheeks clapped
If the Looney Tunes has more screentime on 2D, you know the filmmakers did the right thing
watched the first one in theaters and I loved it and judging by this trailer II AM LOVING IT
1:45 you can see Pennywise on the right haha
This looks better then I expected ngl
Bruh
I'm not even mad about the Lola redesign anymore, this is sick!!!
I LOVED THIS TRAILER!!
Finallyyyyy
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Im calling it.....there will be a michael jordan cameo
Loved it.surely gonna watch it👍
At least Billy West isn't doing bugs bunny voice....his version of bugs is TERRIBLE!!!
Siivagunner is gonna have a field day when this movie releases.
YES🙌
Looks promising
😆 watch this become a part of the MCU
DUDE, SCOOBY DOO, THE FLINTSTONES, YOGI BEAR, MAGILLA GORILLA, THE FRICKIN’ IRON GIANT, HOLY CRAP THIS IS GONNA BE AMAZING
How many Uyghur's were enslaved to help Lebron make this movie?
This looks dope & funny, how the fuck can people be made? Let me guess...cause it wasn't MJ lol grow up.  That whole movie of the first one they were horrible actors lmfao this one has great actors.  Even LeBrons son makes this a better acting space jam then MJ haha
haha yup
Yeah will smith don’t lmao aye I’m watching it though
haha nope
This is like Ready Player One: Basketball, but I am glad they created a part 2 of Space Jam, it was one of my childhood go to movies.
Lmao this looks stupid af and I can tell everyone in this comment section isnt old enough to pay for their phone bill.
People don't like lebron as much as lebron and the media thinks
As an *Early 2000s* kid, who grew up with the original, I’m HELLA excited!  Also, the fact *Don Cheadle* is the *main antagonist,* makes this even better!!!
Please don’t ruin my childhood!!
Rip Lola
If only theres a Cameo from MJ, I know thats a tall order. Or at least a reference to the first space jam movie with a picture or something..
Bru is this intended for 3 year olds like bru why would anyone above the age of 13 watch such a cringey film. I am  utterly displeased that movies like this are still being made. Stick to cartoons.
I BELEIVE I CAN FL-  oh wait that songs CANCELLED
There is so much cameos left and right, I need to spot where the Animaniacs are.
I am not supporting wb anymore
0:35 for game of thrones fans!!
Wait. Did I just saw Drogon? Because that was unexpected and it's awesome. This looks awesome.
imagine if chester cheetah was in this movie
NOICE💖
why won't you leave the iron giant alone
WHAT A TIGHT LITTLE TRAILER... *inhales deeply* IT STINKS...
https://youtu.be/-k78nOzdA0Q
If LeBron beats the Goon squad and The Nets he’s officially the GOAT
Ugh, they went with CGI animation?  Why?
WHERES PEPE
1:44 is that Kong
I'll stick to MJs Space Jam tbh...
Where is beep beep beep
That... is... AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!
What is this Ready Player One part two bullshit?
Garbage
This is going to b Awxm 😍😍
Eh, what's up doc?
Finna make Tom and jerry look like 💩💩💩💩
I am a Jazz fan and I love the first one but Ledumb only stupid LA fans watching this crap like we’re is Curry man way more inspirational than LeDumb
Anyone notice Penneywise? 😀😂😀
There's always gotta be a ninja grandma.
Imagine all the lola bunny fan art
Holy shit. Lebron james is animated.
My reaction:👌😱🤯🙏😂
I stick forever with Space Jam 1...with Michael Jordan!
By the end of this movie it would have two words: Awesomeness Overload
2:23 the night king!?
And Conjuring 3 trailer when??
🐰🏀
This looks absolutely horrible.
This is going to sweep the Razzies clean.
Is it just me or does this not look very good
Hey Capt Burnham ! Go back to Discovery We need you There !
I'll watch anything with iron giant in
Y'all know James is about to go Game 7 on their asses since they threatened his son...
That’s Anthony Davis isn’t it
Ok here i go! Pete take me down what you do- WHOOOOOaaaaaa!aaa NOT YEEEET AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH-(static) also I brought my camera.
Ok, rapey skunk goes out, sure, fine. Gun crazy man that shoots everything is a-ok. Americans will american.
Honestly meh, first one with MJ will always be a classic.
2:28 - 2:32 Granny got some moves
why they have to downgrade my girl lola tho😔
They could’ve brought in mj   And let the gang make fun of him   Like man you got old
Damn.....after vision miss Falcon and shot Rhodes this happens...did war machine tool over Tony's hologram project or what?
original space jam with michael jordan is better to be honest
And Pepe Le Pew??? 🙁
Mad
Boom, you lookin for this?
When lebron was animated he looks like LaMarcus Aldridge
1:51 is that bird man supposed to be AD lol?
How Kong look better here than in his own movie
The sequel to Ready Player One looks pretty good!
The Joker is back!
We see people who are cartoons. We see people who AREN'T cartoons. We see the MASK. But though we see the water tower, we are missing one thing...                        WHERE ARE THE WARNER SIBLINGS, I AIN'T WATCHING HIS MOVIE WITHOUT THEM!!!!!!!!!
Lebron looking lean. This seems like portions of this may have been filmed a few years back.
Looks lame and ...just another thing LeBron is chasing jordan
looney tunes be like "Jordan's quite hairy today"
Didn't even know the B grade player can have Space Jam like MJ .. What a funny
Senior Discount!
Mmm pinta a que va a ser una poronga jaja aunque bueno no importa que tan madera sea Lebron dudo que sea peor actor que Durant
Damn give us the ost 🔥🔥🔥🔥
SICK MOVES FROM GRANNY!!!!!
this is like ready player one movie?
If I had a nickle for everything the iron giant was in a crossover movie that took place in a virtual world, I would have two nickles. Which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice.
My inner child is screaming of joy!! Im all for this!
No Jordan or Murray? I’m out
Nobody: WB: remember Space Jam?
well WB if you can put all your property from flintstone to king kong into this...you can #restorethesnyderverse
Who is this tall guy, he should play basketball 🏀
Song pls..!!!
Already looks like trash
That's all Folks!
LMAOOO!! GRANNY!!!
Please be a tournament arc movie! Please be a tournament arc movie!
This kind of reminds me of Ready Player One
I hope Bill Murray saves the day in this movie just like he did in the first one.
Nice that they can use an IP they have cancelled so many beloved characters from and then the "Woke King" can use that IP to elevate himself because it was one of Jordan's moves.  Pathetically obvious.  Oh yea probably due to LeBron's contract, a cameo for Jordan is as likely as the squad getting a pep talk from Foghorn Leghorn.
This trailer soundtrack hit me in my nostalgia.
Oh oh  mighty Michael Berman from STD play also in this movie...
Bruh why did people complain about Lola Bunny’s design? It’s actually pretty ok, not as good as the first one but still good.
actress who plays his wife is garbage. and the overall this trailer looks kinda disappointing, flashy, but soulless. as if movie is produced / directed by ja jar abrams.
THAT DUNK OMG!!!
What is this absolute shambles ive just took 2 minutes and 38 seconds to watch live action looney toons are awful
eww no
This movie will be amazing
My nigga wrote king kong😂💀
2:31 The ball goes to Robin 👏
Yo, I'm legit so hyped for this.
I wonder if they used slave labour from the Uygher concentration camps to make this movie too
Who's the main villain?Toby Emmerich(chairman of WB)?😂🤣
So Awesome!!!!!
4 days after my birthday ^^!
You can see Pennywise from "IT" @ 1:46 on the right
Penny wise 👀 1:45
OMG  This trailer is awesome
Pure fucking garbage. Kids don't care about cartoons or basketball.
So its now confirmed that Don Cheadle is the Overlord of Warner Brothers
There Everywhere Of Crossover
Granny is the real OG here
It's more of a crossover than being a space jam. I'll be fine with that since I can't replaced my love for the original and with The MJ. And even removing some of the looney tunes character.
Well... This looks good!
you can say that mj is the goat, but you can’t deny that lbj is the better actor between them.
Bro iron giant on the team would be sick af
This bring back memory
1:38 it's the old Jersey
at 1:45 you can see Mr freeze the one from Clooney laughing behind don
That is Michael Jordan's movie since they did this now ruins his legacy. There's certain things you don't touch in a legend like Michael Jordan that does something you do not touch
WHAT A PIECE OF S....T!!!
What did you do Barry?
Not gonna lie its pretty good :D kinda hoping it was like still connected to the old classic.. or did they do a reboot lol
LeBron James: Into the Warner-verse
Give Iron Giant his own 2D sequel already
Sam using his revolvers? Isn't that against the no guns law?
this Ready Player One sequel looks odd
it's space jam like you've never seen before. (Movie announcer)  Nobody:😑  Me: Everybody get up it's time to slam now, we've got a real thing going on.... Welcome to the SPACE JAM!! ....
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse 💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
Looks terrible
LeBron bruh. You are a great player, but you will never be a Michael Jordan. Please stop trying.
I wish I could just blow on my thumb and instantly become almost 7 feet tall.
I don't know how I feel about this. It looks fun and potentially really great but at the same time it looks more like a Ready Player One film than a Looney Tunes film....
this movie's whole appeal is that when you're watching it you will go "i recognize that"
Lebron's cartoon looks like LaMarcus Aldridge. 🙃
Um, that robot looks an awful lot like Kobe Bryant.
Its so excessive and I'm gonna watch like an 8 year old
I have never cringed so hard before, like no? what is that? AND THEY REMIXED THE BEST SONG?! im so pissed. sorry.
#RESTORETHESNYDERVERSE
I feel like there's an important lesson that could have been included in this film had a certain skunk not been removed in an attempt to appeal to Twitter users.
Space Jam is definitely Ready Player One
I am very hyped for this movie it looks amazing!
Ah gee and warner was considerate enough to use the classic 1990s animation in 4k amazing choice. Im hyped
These vfx are stimulating
Endgame: I am inevitable    Warner bros: hold my carrot and Jordan's
Even Drogon from Game of Thrones came to watch the game lol dope
Ready player one: basketball edition
I can't wait for the memes
OMFG that Whatever Happened to Baby Jane reference behind Don Cheedle when he says “welcome to the Space Jam!” 👏🏻
Brodie i don't know how i feel about this... all these extra special effects don't mean shxt if this movie has no heart..  Lebron losing his son?? Such a lazy plot.  Yooo the goon squad get the fxck outta here lol
Welcome to the slam!! So excited!
What's up doc bugs Shoots the ball Daffy
It's gonna be a Memes rain
The fact that LeBron’s help request was   #1 Superman #2 Gandalf  #3 King Kong #4 Iron Giant #5???  makes the movie realistic that it’s LeBron
Where is Pepe le pew?
Ready player one 2?
Better than Suicide Squad!!!   #restorethesnyderverse
You had me with the 2D but lost me when it became Ready Player One and turning some the characters CG. I don't initially have issues with 3D but some of the characters don't benefit from it well. Mostly feels like involving the other IPs is a clutch as if there's something about the film they weren't confident in and needed that boost.
Not sure if a big crossover basketball which is a sequel to Space Jam which looks like the same movie just with different plots is gonna work or not yet I'm very excited for it
This aint space jam this is ready player one basketball edition 💀
Kn
#ContinuetheMonsterverse
Funny the only time LeBron flashes some dunks other than warm ups hahahahaha still won't ever compete in dunk comp like Kobe or mj
It's like Ready Player One and Wreck it Ralph Wrecks the Internet
So... which five rappers should collab on "Hit 'Em High" for this film?  🤣
me: shoot the ball the american kid: 1:25
I'd really like to see James play Jason Voorhees as he has expressed interest in the past
Oh.... oh no.....
And whole movie spoiled right there.  We all know that LBJ going to win in the end. Could've kept the whole roster a secret at least for the movie.
Well wb you had a good run can't wait to see this movie bomb. Fuck lefraud james
No... Just... No.  Have you all forgotten the steaming pile that was the 1st Space Jam movie??? I worked for WB at the time. I got to see the movie for free and I STILL wanted my money back.
Space Jam came out when I was 7 years old. I LOVED IT. I'm excited to see this but I am always going to find it funny that the ServerVerse looks so much like the OASIS. Glad the sequel shook things up a bit though and it wasn't exactly the same thing over again...
25 years   Welcome back to the JAM
Am I the only one who thinks this is crap? You can call me boomer, but I am too old school for this brazen rip off of a cult classic. That simply isn’t my jam.
Bruhh, Lola bunny got nerfed
this looks way better than it needed to be
LeGM BACK AT IT AGAIN Recruiting superheros now 😂
Dope in it's own way but jordans seemed better lol
If kong is in this film can GODZILLA BE IN THIS FILM TO!?!?!?@?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
Ready Player One.exe
BIG CHUNGUS!!!
Somewhere out there, a conspiracy video is being made about the hidden messages about number 88 granny going "old school" on the black guys but.
#restorethesnyderverse
Great flopping skills= Great acting skills
This is it. This is the movie
The director of Undercover Brother and the producer who had directed Black Panther... HBO Max... sign me the hell up!!!!!  I'm definitely gonna watch this Space Jam sequel!!!!!
NO!!!!!! WB, you’ve taken away my childhood!!!!! HOW DARE YOU!!! HOW DARE YOU!!!! NO SPEEDY GONZALEZ!!! NO PEPE LE PEW!!!! NO SEXY LOLA BUNNY!!!
So you turned the classic cartoon characters into 3D CGI crap, stole a bunch of scenes from Ready Player One and got that actress from Discovery who could not act wet in a rainstorm. Great. Is there any other way in which you'd like to fail?
Multiverse All Star Game. I'm ready as hell 🔥🔥🔥
No way I'm letting my kids watch this race baiting Jordan wannabe.cartoon characters lives matter!
#restorethesnyderverse
Finally, a new one, it took a while, but its here
This Woke leftist version is going to be a dumpster fire 🔥. Thanks WB, I hate it. Bring MJ back, not this race hustler
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
This is already better version than Jordan's.. You know that Lebron is the GOAT in basketball and in Space Jam movies..
Cant act but neither could mj and it was still fire
Thid gives me ready player one vibes
Cool dude amazing
This looks terrible
No one asked for it, everyone secretly wanted it.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The original space jam is better
They killed my nigga Pepe but put the guys from the clockwork orange lmao
Bronny looks different...🤔😂
That king kong scene git me into thinking of Ready Player One😅
hopefully, they make a shoe for this movie as they did with Jordan, I would love to buy LeBron jams or space James.
Looks good😿👍🏿
Holy fucking shit it sucks so much, should've called it "Warner Bros the movie"
1:45 your reaction after viewing this trailer and the Batman trailer
This space jam lore is getting too intense
Looks better than TOM & JERRY
So they just had assets from Ready Player One. Got it.
Does this take place before or after the Chaos Dunk?
If you pause at 1:46 you can see pennywise in the back
It was looking cool till Granny made the old school joke.
Space Jam: A New Legacy is Space Jam mixed with Ready Player One!
This a movie where Don cheadle would be like “BOOM, you’re looking for this?”
It looks really cool. I hope it’s good.
Ready Player Jam
I wasn’t expecting Ready Player Two this early.
I swear the old theme better make an appearance at a crucial point damnit.
I thought that the brooklyn nets will be in the movie
More like Cyber Space Jam.
This looks good
I swear I saw majin buu
Waner bros, you create a universe out of you, man want your became Warner Brothers the universe of entertainment.
Istg if theres people complaining about character development in this movie
It's not the same without a Michael Jackson theme jam track!!!
God damn, I'm pumped af! I love the original movie with MJ but this looks fire :-D
Will still see but don't  call it  a sequel its  a reboot yhe first is ashamed to be with it killer
Looks like a desperate attempt to make some quick money from the nostalgia... I don't know whom greenlighted this shit, but, that person needs to be whipped in public
Would be amazing if the opening of this film is slightly similar to the original Space Jam. A "I believe I can fly" moment followed by the names of Le Bron and Bugs Bunny preceding the movie title
Reminds me of a  bollywood movie called "toonpur ka superhero".
Now this is going to be funny
“LAME!.”—Cartman
This is either going to be absolutely amazing or a cash grab that won't make back its budget and we will never see space jam again
I need this updated Space Jam song on my playlist A$AP
Music is awesome
Lebron James enters the quantum realm leaked
At 2:22 the Night King from Game of Thrones is on the left
Space jam a new legacy tote bags
1:45 is that Mister Freeze and Pennywise on the right😂
If Ready player 1 was taken over by looney tunes and sprite cranberry
Is this a short film or is it releasing in theaters
This looks so awful. Shame on you LeBron for ruining a classic. I hope MJ slaps you.
What the Looney hell
1:39 Okay Ready Player 1 ....
Smh look wack
This makes me feel nostalgic!!! Amazing
Kong popping up in everything now.
Of course they got lebron lol
I can hear the creeps on Deviantart heavily breathing in the background
Can’t wait for skip to use lebron missing that dunk at 2:12 as a way to prove he is not the goat
1:46, BABY JANE!!!! Something tells me that she said, “Screw killing my sister! I might as well grab two vanilla ice cream cones and go find that basketball game everyone is talking about. Lebron what’s-his-name and Bugs Bunny are in it! So, Blanche, you just lay there in the sand while I enjoy ALL THE BASKETBALL I WANT! See ya when I get back you miserable bitch! (Laughs in EVIL)”.
Is this a reboot or a sequel? Would be cool if they acknowledge what happened in the first with Jordan. This looks promising.
Not going to watch your commie movie
I see Kong found himself some pickup games in Hollow Earth
HBO verse you mean?
Ready Player Two?
What would be awesome is instead of Lebron taking the last shot, he passes it
This makes me miss Michael so much
Acting : LeBron >>> Jordan
Sorry guys I can ignore that Lola has been nerved
#restoreThesynderverse
Is this Space Jam, or Ready Player One?
I feel like the only cgi were getting from this movie is the final scene where they're playing basketball. And the rest of the movie will be in 2D. 🤔
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
More like what in the overstimulation seizure inducing ready player one hell
Fuck this movie!  NEW SPACE JAM REMIX BABY!
Remember folks. Warner brothers took down one of meat canyons videos and it’s now cannon that Bugs Bunny is a struggling rapist  Also knowing the internet and how they LOVE Lola Bunny go to 2:11. Thank me later
#Justice4PepelePew
It looks like ready player one but basketball  and it’s awewsome!
Looks just as terrible as the first one. Can't wait to not see it.
LeBron acting...enough said
I fuck with this heavy ngl it looks so stupid and dumb like the original I can’t wait
Wouldn’t be the first trailer this year to have King Kong
1:18 woaa can we see Superman in this movie ? 🤔😮
So rhodey become main villain or something!
For 20 years we’ve been waiting.
Did you like it, doc?
his best acting is in the court, bugs bunny carried him in this
I am so excited for this movie  can't wait to see it 💙💙
Lebrons acting skills are horrible
Don Cheadle is the king?
DAMN!!!
Looks so bad
I feel like Lebron is the only player in the movie
LeBron and Bugs: Woah. Me: Ma'am, that's a kicked ball violation.
Did they scrap the other nba players that were supposed to be in there like I think jaylen brown or kemba was said to be in there cos it imo it would be better if there was other nba players
Rhodes is that you ?
Thundercats bro???? So hyped for this movie
At 1:15 run bary run🙂
Ehhhhh. Looks ok. The heavy CGI is too distracting. Looney tunes is all about classic 2D animation and gags. This is more like Ready Player One which was a garbled snooze fest.
Superman and king kong,yup
So this is what WarMachine was doing after Endgame
I'm going to admit it, the Space Jam remix sounds gnarly.
Tron Legacy and Ready Player One vibes.
IT WAS ME, BARRY. I MADE THEM DRAW LOLA BUNNY WITH FEWER SEXUAL FEATURES SO THAT YOU WOULDNT BE HORNY AND REDUCE YOUR BLOODFLOW TO MAKE YOU A MILLISECOND SLOWER. SLOW ENOUGH FOR ME TO KILL IRIS.
2:23 never thought I’d see the day where Alex’s gang from Clockwork Orange, The Whitewalkers, Dino from Flintstones, Blue Falcon & Dynomutt, Captain Caveman and Mystery Inc would be watching The Looney Tunes and LeBron James play basketball
Kinda remind me of ready player one
This movie like ready player one
#restoresnyderverse
this looks genuinely amazing
Michael Jordan better make an appearance by the end of this movie!! Would love to see the Looney Tunes reaction after seeing him again
Ok.   #restorethesnyderverse
You got me at Iron Giant.
What I know about this new one comparing it to the first one. The first one did so many things that they probably wouldn’t do today, which is why I love it, it’s basically the 90’s captured in a bottle. Unless they stay true to the first movie, hopefully they will, I guess I can see it being good. But I’m worried it won’t capture the spirit of the original. Either way, we’ll see, I’m still gonna see the movie. One thing is for sure, it’s gonna sell tickets like hot cakes!
00:28 What in "The Matrix" hell?
As Darth Sidious said: "Looong have I waited..."
This is absolutely fantastic. This might be better than the original...which won’t be hard honestly
Oh my I'm gonna be there for the premiere
01:43 yabba dabba dooo
ready player one, anyone?
I’m loosing my mind because this trailer is so Damn hype
Who's LeBron's fictional son here? Is he getting a spanking too?
1:17: James was TeamKong
Dreams:Superman Reals:Daffy Duck
Ready Player One..? is that you?
Anyone else think this was gonna be bad but when they saw the trailer it actually looks good
Don't care #RestoreTheSnyderVerse
I remember watching Michael Jordan damn time flies.
It looks sick. Lets go
While I don’t agree with the politics and stuff surrounding the making of the movie, I also cannot deny that regardless of that the movie does look good
It’s a sad day when cancel culture comes for lolas big naturals
That's so bad...
Okay, this is lit.
Ughhh looks like a ready player one x another remake bullshit to me  I'll pirate it tho i guess
The Small Foot characters are in it! This movie looks great. Please give it to me now.
0:38 --- Lebron is swirling out of Kansas!
this looks really......  Disappointing  nothing can top the first movie
YES!!!
I want this movie to suck but in the best possible way.
Damn bro, what is the music used in the trailer?
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse #RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Dude... They ruined it.
lebron wants to mike soo bad lol.
Plot twist: this movie is a sequel for Godzilla Vs. Kong
น่าดู x1000000
There is bad words?
Never knew james is a good actor.. coz of his flopped
Hmmmm....Not impressed.
Ugh
Why is lola bunny ugly here
00:38 wizard of oz
As a Lebron fan it would be cool as hell if Michael Jordan appeared in this as a cameo
Actually looks pretty decent
(Cyber)Space Jam. I was expecting aliens again in this sequel, which would’ve been still good... but this is clever. Great work, WB. Can’t wait! 😍
This kinda reminds me of Ready Player One.
HBO Max the movie!
Me: "I hope this is partially good. Space Jam with Michael Jordan was so go–"  After watching trailer: *"YO, THIS GONNA BE GOOD!"*
GOAT James
I’m only watching this cause it’s basically Ready Player One 2
Pepe le pew?
CINEMA
My expectations about this was very low ,but seeing this woooooow looks Amazing
poggers
It's EXACTLY how I imagined it to be !!! Well done Warner Bros.!!
Where’s my son Don?..... Don Cheadle..... and I already have this movie figured out.
"The perfect sequel doesn't exist" Space Jam: A New Legacy: Hold my beer.
I remember them saying it’s gonna be nba players in here. But they’re not on bron’s team. If that’s the case they da goon squad
No 90s kid with any self respect will watch or enjoy this
Kong on vacation after what happened with him and the G-man
I actually dug the trailer, at the end of the day I just hope people treat this movie with outline that it's made for kids and especially the kids that grew up on Lebron
Слишком много темнокожих персонажей

Ready Player One: Space Jam Edition
Wtf?
😳😮
1:40 that robot has been in so many movies
I really didn't expect this movie to be so futuristic, but at the same time, I'm not that surprised.
At 2:07 on the very left you can see The Mask standing next to Penguin
Ready Player One + Space Jam = DAMN
so, it's not a sequel..
Nooooop, wtf is this, reck it ralph\ ready player one?
This seems like a mix of the original space jam and ready player one. I’m very interested in this
Welcome to the Space Jam!
For the kids
Literally this does set up the multiverse which everything that Warner Bros has created for many years.
Ready Player One: NBA Edition
Uhhhhh, no
Looks good.. saw the first one at the movies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7jQehVJpnQ
not the iron giant... not again...
Don't forget that Bugs Bunny is canonically a struggling rapist.
>2D cinematic animation makes a short return >Iron Giant, King Kong and the Hanna-Barbera guys are also in this >NBA Players are now elemental/monster things Really glad i have HBO Max
honestly the moment I saw it become Ready Player Jam I noped out of here
The cartoon is 128 bit cool ⭐
Idk how to feel about this
Dad: Where's my son?  Rhodey: 𝗕𝗼𝗼𝗺! 𝘆𝗼𝘂'𝗿𝗲 𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀?
2:10 classic D Wade assist ♥
THEY GAVE ELMER HIS GUNS BACK 🔫
This looks like shit and I love it. This movie will be a train wreck and I want to see it day 1
Not going to lie, that looks fun.
Y’all ready for this?!
Have to admit, didn't see that one coming.
movie of the year
It looks fun !!!
This doesn’t look bad actually!
I was extremely skeptical but that actually looks dope
Big ass Question: where’s PEPE LE PEW?
Multiverse.:v
Nice to know they fixed Lola Bunny
No one's gonna talk about how sick the goon squad looks
1:58 mostly everyone when they saw the new captain America.
this aint my lolla bunny !
Looks so good 😊
1:40 “Welcome to... the OASIS!" 😍
Vaya vaya vaya 😎🍷
I don't wanna say i hate it or like it but it look a little good , but the looney tunes loook weird with there cgi form   And why LeBron in the trailer transform into a cartoon form instead of his human form like that first movie where Michael Jordan went into the looney tune world , he was in human form .  And i really think they could've make it better with the whole video game sucking LeBron and his son and wife , but whenever it just me thinking.   Also bring Pepe le pew back    #pepelepew   Edit : overall this trailer is pretty good  Edit 2 : i love their bringing wb character back in the movie , like the mask , kong , scooby doo etc
LeAstronaut winning Space Rings 🤡
It just doesn’t have the vibe of the first space jam
Not gonna lie..looks kinda dope
Not sure about this. Why is Lebron a cartoon? Looks like a rent not a theater experience. Trying too hard to be Ready Player One and Wreck it Ralph.
Space Jam just became wreck it Ralph and ready player one.
Okay, the only way this works if they go over the top, bordering stupidly dumb ideas with this movie. The first one just wasn't dumb enough. Sometimes dumb= Absolute genius. Take tips from the Fast franchise or this movie will not work.
🔥🔥🔥
Holy shit that’s a lot of characters!
Lola bunny looks cute 😍
I like this! Especially when WAG started experimenting with 2D animation for the first time!
Yes...
Damn, this actually looks good
Why does Lebron turn into a toon? Why do the toons turn CG? Thats wrong.
Zero chance in hell this has 30 thousands likes in 2 hours.  Fake news, fake votes...worst trailer since Ghostbusters.
I didn't think James, and the companies behind this living abortion, could make a worse product that wonder woman.
3D Loony Tunes aren't real, they can't hurt you.  3D Loony Tunes:
Wtf? this guy makes M.J seem like a shakespearean class actor. Jesus why the cyber sh*t? Why Don Cheadle? Why... NVM, F this
Que clase de ready player one es esto?
IT 1:46
Ready player one meets basketball
Grandni 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
WELCOME TO THE SPACE JAM Y’ALL!!!
😁💯 #RestoreTheSnyderVerse #ForZackSnyder #UsUnited
This is power  of warner bros studios....
1:44 you know its gonna be a good movie when kong gets involved Lol. Guess he decided to let loose after fighting godzilla 😂. Not gonna lie tho. This movie looks better than i expected
Ready Player Two?
Why'd you lighten LeBron's skin in animated form?
I'm glad they didn't change Lola too much she still cute
Lola got out of shape, yeah its a no from me champ
It would be hilarious if the one of the bad guys is Skip Bayless
This looks good!
Y donde esta el goat JR Smith?
the best cgi I saw was lebrons hair
Im getting a TRON:LEGACY vibe out of this
So I guess Shaggy and Scooby makes a cameo appearance at 1:39. Lol
Who saw pennywise
HOORAY!!!!!!!!!
Welcome to the Warner Bros universe
That is awesome of that movie I can’t wait to see it I saw of all characters
How bout that?! WB went all out with this. Plus this is the 3rd time I’ve seen the Iron Giant. Maybe it’s a Sign that we might get a sequel to that film eventually.
God I wish ready player one didn't come out before this (or at all lmao) because now when we see all those cg characters moving around i get instant flashbacks to that. Once I separate it from that it does look pretty great lol, also great that they're making an original plot, like it's not the martians coming back for round 2 or something lazy
I'm hype
2:22 Wtf the Clockwork Orange characters are even in this movie
Someone pls give me trailer soundtrack id!!!
Im gonna watch the fuck out of this
LOOKS LIKE SHIT !!!
Micheal Jordan better make a cameo appearance in the this movie.
This looks absolutely awful I'm so disappointed 😭
The question is will The Iron Giant finally meet Superman?
WB should definitely make movies on old Hannah-Barbera cartoon characters 🤩🤩🤩🤩
DAYUM! DOPE!!!
Of COURSE... Lebron tryna make a super team 🤦
Wow this is cringe as fuck
#restorethesnyderverse
#restorethesnuderverse
😂😂😂👍
🔥🔥🔥
So frustrating...
“Black people are being hunted.”  -LeBron “Divide and Conquer” James
Hey look, it's the most commercially successful movie the Iron Giant has ever been part of!
Ah. Im feeling the same cringe when the first space jam came out. Maybe this is slightly cringier. But I'll watch it regardless.
Remember when LeBron and Co. said that the “n word” was spray painted on their LA mansion (before he went to the Lakers)? But when the cops got there, there was ZERO EVIDENCE of any vandalism, as they claimed they “cleaned it up” before the cops got there? Yet OF COURSE, the news never mentioned the simple fact that there was no proof whatsoever but still pushed the story anyways for a few days?  Lmfao anyone remember that nice little divide and conquer attempt at subverting the masses? Yeah, LeBron is a total minion of the system.
1:40 that ready player one's Iron Giant, you can tell by some of the incomplete parts in his armor. Aech never got to finish it before battle
You just got coconut malled 😂 . Share this with your friends to totally coconut mall them 😂 .
So ready player one but b-ball? (And no that is not a compliment)
When the world need them the most, they came...
Ngl this movie makes more sense than the first one
Seeing this trailer dozens of times makes it very tempting and very impatient of want the movie now but sadly it’s only two months away and it’s a very long wait
The court size looks too restricted.
the theme of this movie should be Everybody Circulation!
Looks like a discount ready player one lol
Something else for LeChina to destroy.
Monke is here
What Kong doing here? Escaping Godzilla
There has to be a MJ or Monstar reference
Ummmm wtf did I just watch lol 😂
First trailer and you already ruined it
looks good but still #restorethesnyderverse
This guy knows how to play basketball. I guess  he should join league team or something.
Is R-Kelly doing the sound track to the sequel.....oh yeah nevermind
Too digital, too animated.
I hope the his lives up to the first movie it looks rlly good
Did ANYONE SEE THE MASK????
I don't know, don't look like a god movie. Far from Space Jam with Jordan.
*I was actually gonna watch space jam for the time yesterday, but didn't feel like it. Ironic how this trailer came out today.*
The trailer is not bad as I expect. Considering Lola winked at me.
I don't think I was ready But I'm glad it's here!
I love how they utilize 2D animation
YESS!
That looks crazy!!! but #RestoreTheSnyderCut
Klay Thompson, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Draymond Green, and Kyle Kuzma all making cameos, that’s gonna be crazy
*I’m just wondering, how much cgi did they have to put in that hairline* 🤔
Warner Bros. Multiverse Confirmed! Let’s hope Tom and Jerry are in this.
Look how they massacred my girl ;-;
I watch the☝️one so definitely ill be watching this ✌🏼
Are you sure this isn't a Ready Player One  vibe?
#RestoreTheSnyderverse
bruh....Lola fuckin' W I N K E D at the screen
*they did the iconic lebro wade alley oop 🔥🔥🔥*
ready player two.🤣
I miss kobe bryant
I was about to compliment them actually using 2d toons, but then they had to go and ruin it by making them 3d.
we all know that big chungus is gonna gonna carry the whole game soon
Horrible lol
Garbage.
2:10 oh yea, wade style
Oh hell yea
Esta si sera una buena historia McFly!
So will space jam 3 have Zion or Luka?
So between Space Jam and Ready Player One, Iron Giant has been busy
What was the CGI budget for LeBron's hairline
Imagine Bron casting our favorites. Goat Carusso, Aquaman Adams, Logo Lillard, 50point Gordon, Big Boban, D-Rose, and Tacko Freakin Fall.
I understand why WB chose to have their 2021 slate release on HBO Max... Because so far they have ALL been hot garbage, and this newly passed bowel movement looks to be no different.
So this is just Ready Player One without any good story.  Basically it is just like the Hyperscan console
Did the whole Dwayne Wade Alley Oop celebration! 😀 2:10
this is lookin weird,,,, why is this just ready player one again?? tis nice to see theatrical 2d animation again tho lmao, the toons’ 3d models also look nice 👀
Que paso con esos fps's??
What in the ready player one is this
You know what I should wait. Hehe
Recycling old jokes... movie already trash before it’s out
Name of the song please?
It took 25 years, but we are finally getting a sequel.
LeBron should have his own Looney Tunes Cartoon!
When Lebron gets sucked into the domain. WHAT IS THE NAME OF THAT SONG?
It's so dense.
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Welcome to the space jam, come on and jam!
#ReleaseTheAyerCut  #RestoreTheSnyderVerse
The original version wit MJ way better I can just tell it by tha trailer, Lebron wants to be Jordan so bad
0:46 This is the snyderverse!!!
2:11 Lola Wade
0:44 BOOM! Lookin’ for this?
Birdman is AD
Lebron bout to become Lejam
Before watching the Trailer: Pls don't suck. After watching the Trailer: Ready Player One meets Lonely Tunes... Ok.
Whoa 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Oh maaan Crazy! That's  my childhood right there
Looking at this trailer it makes me think it’s a TV movie
Too bad Lebron is trash 🗑
1:45 Its just me or i just feel like i saw Robert downey jr in the background....and i check it wasn't
dislikes are from lebron haters
King kong your in the wrong movie
I can already hear the Lola fans
Steph Curry deserved the major role.  We dont care about this.
NewRockstar this is for you.. 1000 easter eggs in this video.
Ready Player 2 looking good
Rip Lola Bunny but the movie looks so good!
This movie for the bronsexuals let’s be serious here.     SPACE JAM the original is better than this bullshit
que mierda acabo de ver
I did NOT expect a Ready Player One sequel.
add big chungus
WB doesn't want to do  snyderverse...but they want to do this.....🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
OH MY GOD NO WAY!
I'm pretty sure there will be an hour long video somebody makes highlighting every character in the background.
The real question... Is Bill Murray coming back?
Well just hope it's good !!
This looks and sounds awful. Lebron doesn't have the charisma micheal jordon did.
Makes me so happy
Oh boy, Lola's gonna introduce a whole new generation of furries. LOL
0:46 synderverseee?
That was gas
This is like ready player one all over again
Sup slime
When they can't afford Bronny so they they get knockoff Bronny.😂😂
Hope it's not just a blatant rehash as many sequels have been.
Yeah gonna pass
This is dope, but I can't be happy bout it cause they made.the cartoon lola good but the second one look like shit
Waiting for cristiano Ronaldo
"What in the matrix hell?" Lol
Next level 🥳
Really hoping that there's a reference to the original Space Jam.
Dude why did you follow Disney’s steps as they ruined Star Wars and now you ruined Space Jam
Say what you want about the trailer but on god those colors are so vibrant and I LOVE IT
The worlds look like kingdomhearts
Isss soooo COOL!!!! Im so excited!!!
Omg This Movie Will Be So Cool As F***. Reminds me Of Avengers End Be Honest
This trailer have to be the video of the year for all these youtubers with their "50 things you missed"-videos
Look at all that oppression LeBron James is suffering.
I wonder if this movie will begin a new Furry movement with Lola bunny, or if they’ll totally ruin her appearance cause I honestly couldn’t really tell from the trailer.
ну и параша / piece of shit
What did they do to my little Lola Bunny... what a shame...
Ready player one effect...
They didn’t show the nba players that’s in the movie that must be the final game when LBJ call them up 😂 we gone get to see some of the best All-Star team defense we’ll ever see in a movie😂
Cancel LeBron
Give us old lola bunny back trash SJW studio
🐰🐧🐤
Yeah no. Kind of disappointed.
Kobe zamanunda yapılmalıydı
This is legendary. all the past comes😘 into present ❤️❤️
So, Pepé Le Pew is not okay, but it's fine that Yosemite Sam shoots Daffy Duck in the face?! Confused...
Meh... #RestoretheSnyderverse
2:10 Anyone else noticed the Dwayne wade to Lebron James alley Oop?
This look like a BLAST
Aw nostalgia
Oh boy this sequel is gonna top the original movie Oh Yeah!!
This is already my jam. Exicited for this.
Last time we had good hand drawn animation in a movie was with Looney Tunes: Back in Action
Cmon and slam
James rhodes(war machine) after endgame be like:
How wants to bet your going to have a Karen saying this is not suitable for kids because I like the movie can't wait to see it
I’m not watching this. Looks childish. Lebron acting is horrible. Horrible
Lets gooo!!
That, was awesome 😎
No Thanks
This movie is going to be better than the original guys I hope it's good! 😊👍
Cool, cool          How about #RestoreTheSnyderverse
I've never seen the original Space Jam, but I am really freaking curious
King kong is back at it again
What About “Tom and Jerry” themselves? Superman? Batman? Wonder Woman? Rest of the Justice League? Yakko, Wakko And Dot? All the Hanna Barbera Characters like Yogi, Boo boo? Walt Gator? TC? All the others from Warner Bros Cartoons?
So I guess after Iron man died war machine decided to retired and take over an entire server
This looks great, my only gripe is I wish they kept the classic 2D look for the whole thing
I hope Micheal Jordan makes some kind of cameo in this movie
"Since he was legally claimed by Warner Brothers Entertainment, it is officially canon that bugs was a struggling rapist all along." Eddy.
Dope
When the bron jame donk
Just horrible makes the first Space Jam to shit stop making remakes of old movies to new ones totally different story in this Space Jam
I loved that they included the Animaniacs in the crowd.
With some characters from Warner looks like Ready Player One.
Produced by Warner Bros. Pictures, Warner Animation Group, Warner Bros. Animation, Hanna-Barbera (Cameo appearances), RKO Pictures and Legendary Pictures (King Kong cameo), New Line Cinema, Village Roadshow Pictures, Lorimar (most of Easter egg cameos including IT, among others) and Turner Entertainment (several cameo appearances) and released by Warner Bros. Pictures and HBO Max.
How come this looks fun to watch
Anybody see any Harry Potter characters?
Me While watching the trailer  😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
King James: Live in Server Verse Terminator: UNKNOWN must Be TERMINATED.
Yesssssss sign me up
where are the white people ? Granny doesn't count
This looks better than i thought it would be.
Ready player one version.
Lebron jamesssssss
I think the movie looks mediocre, it could be alright though, but I'm not sure if I like the art style and animation choice they choose for the toons, they look too clean. Everyone looks a little, too fluid in a way compared to the first Space Jam where there were loonier moments but this just the trailer. There doesn't look like there will be much cartoon like movements once everything goes 3D, Lola looks out of place, but I'll give it a chance.
With all of the references and cameos, looks like WB is future proofing in case they need to dust off these models/costumes lol.
Can't wait also iron giant sold it
TRON Legacy meets Ready Player One meets Space Jam.
the casting was too SICK that we really dont need lbj . he might trade the whole squad😂
im expecting big chungus to be in this
Granny brought the heat!
I'm definitely not the target audience for this movie.
Ok yeah, I'm in
Now we know why Godzilla was so salty in GvK
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
İt's EPİC 👑🔥
Mann. Its good. But is it all about the son? I like the part 1 were they needed to recruit jordan to defeat something and journey..anyway am excited aftee watching the trailer
Let's see how much homosexual / racist propaganda they can fit into this film...it is for kids after all, and that's the target audience for that type of stuff
Aw man they desexualized Granny 😔
the d-wade assist pose.
And lo, as it was prophesized, Lola Bunny returned and initiated the birth of a new generation of furries.
Ok but why’d Lebron turn into a cartoon lol I will be watching either way
Lola Bunny sends her regards.
Skip Bayless when he sees this: This movie will be a flop. Jordan never failed a dunk mid-air
If mj doesn’t make a caneo I’m not watching this
Bring back OG Lola Bunny
Yooooooo the MASK IS IN HERE LMAOOO
The song is fire
Doesn’t look that bad ...i just really really don’t like lebron ..not as a player, but as a person. It’s just hard seeing why they needed a sequel to an amazing original.
wow.. I didnt realize Mickey mouse is starring in the new space jam
This is Going to Be the Ready Player One of Space Jam!
Ima be honest...I got worried when they animated Bron.
Yuh missed me wit this bullshit 👉🏾🚪true space jam is Jordan I’m sorry but the classic still trumps this garbage! Jordan never attached titles to his name in the movie let ur record speak for itself ‘King’ really? Just stop n redo the movie.
lebron the goat
Potential is here, it can better than the first.
Cringe
Interesting... Looking forward to this.
Holy balls this actually looks awesome.
Bron taking care of his Lakers teammates putting Jared Dudley as Elmer Fudd
Iron Giant cameo again ?
Lewoke James the communist
All this time I thought this was a disappointment.... Im right.😂
My fav movie is back
I don't se how you can hate on this, it seems hype as hell!
Aaaaaaaand it's ruined.
😭 is bronny not playing bronny?
Basketball🏀🏀🏀
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
wow i just new about this
Is it just me or does this looks a little bit better than the first? I was always a Space Jam guy since my childhood, they actually made it happen not just 2D CGI but to 3D dimensional. Even though I’m down for this, Michael Jordan will always be #1 in my books especially the first old jersey’s. LETS GET IT TUNE SQUAD🐰🏀
is this a trailer or movie highlight
THIS IS ELITE CRAZY LEVELS RIGHT HERE!! WE'RE BACK TO THE JAM Y'ALL!!!
Why they gotta use cgi models.
AWESOME!!!!! cameos from warner bros properties like the Hanna Barbera Characters, Kong, THe Iron Giant and others too!!!
@1:39 we see the mystery machine and the big giant.... hopefully we get some voice cameos from these guys to!!!!
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
It's Space Jam : Ready Player One.
The song name is Scylla by RL Grime
Did lola just did a dwade?
SHIIIIIT..I might even go to the theater for this one.. 🎤I'm so exited..and I just can't hide it 🤣
Dumb
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Yeah, I really sure This movie takes a place in on of the planet in OASIS from Ready Player One Where is Parzival?
What in the Ready Player One
🔥🔥🔥🔥
ALAMADRE SE VE VERGUSISIIMOOOO
I wonder if Tom and Jerry Easter egg cameo could be in Space Jam A New Legacy?
This looks baddddd 🤮🤮🤮🤮.... no charm, too over the top,  its just bad.
Ready Player One Ft. LeBron
At least I'll don't have to pay for it....🤣😂🤣😂
#restorethesnyderverse
"BOOM, are you looking for this?" * points to lebron's son *
это отвратительно, всё чего касается грязная лапа лебы превращается в цирк уродов
I thought mj acting was bad. but this is some next lvl awful acting
This looks bad, acting and jokes wise😬 visuals are there
If only Jim Carrey reprises his role as The Mask...
2:17 is that the Mask to the right
This is the second time Iron Giant had appeared in a crossover movie. Time to make that sequel
Oh wait its called Tune World
*MAKE LOLA BUNNY THICC AGAIN* The 90s and 2000s kids demand it
0:00 - 0:59  - This is what Pepe Le Pew was sacrificed for?? 01:00 - 2:37 -  One stalker skunk for a multiverse of characters. Balance is restored
#RestoretheSnyderVerse
Bron still got a better squad than the 2007 cavs
Here before trending 🙏🏽.
Lola Bunny is looking gorgeous.
F Pepe le Pew
WOW I LOVE THIS TRAILER EVEN Pete put down the lever called "T⭕⭕N TOWN" AND TRUST ME I LOVE IT EVEN I WATCHED ANIMANIACS version 2020 AND I WATCHED THE MASK AND I WATCHED THE WIZARD OF OZ and........what else did I watched.....? NAH Anyways LEbron.J We will see you in TOON TOWN !
1:41 Jumanji!
Its so damn dark,  I guess to hide Lebron's fading hairline.  MJ did spj1 bald.   Jus sayin bro lol
It will either be great or absolutely horrible
Monstars had personality. I hope these new guys do also.
The announcer: Goon squad  Me: nigga thats the X MEN
Lmao dafuq are yogi and boo boo doing up here 🤣
Do i need to watch the first part?
Jordan better be in this as a cameo so help me God
[Everyone liked that]
can anyone tell me the which music is used in the trailer
Why they choose it to be so cringe?
🔥🔥🔥
Special Visual Effects by Industrial Light & Magic, A Lucasfilm Ltd. Company, Marin County, CA.
The GODS have ANSWERED
Hahaha somewhere MJ laughing
I hope Jordan makes a cameo.
I’m just glad they’re still including the classic 2D animation. It just wouldn’t feel right if the Toon Squad was only 3D-animated.
Seriously you couldn't make the Looney tunes stay 2d? They would have stood out more among the crowd if they stayed 2d
LeGM assembling a super team even in Space Jam, that's some cheese!
1:18 LeBatman assembling the Justice League
is that Klay?? 1:57
who else wants to see a new iron giant move?
I was afraid it would only be in 3d animation but I’m so glad they included the old school 2d cartoon versions as well!
#restorethesnyderverse
Wow toons are rejects 😒 dislike
This looks really stupid but I’m still willing to watch it
You need the MJ secret stuff water bottle to win don’t forget it .
Looks so gud
When is the part where lebron worships the CCP?
Did I just have a stroke?
Guys I know of a way to fix lola bunny, just like fans made #ReleaseTheSnyderCut trend for justice league we need the same for lola, so we gotta get #RealeaseTheCurvyCut trending before this movies premiere come on guys let do it for Lola!!!!
looks like shit. #restorethesnyderverse
2:13 ahhh reeeffff (@djmeechymeech)
I'm not sure if it's just the trailer, But it doesn't look nearly as good as the original. Only thing I can Honestly take from this movie so far is that LeBron James doesn't look like a bad actor.
0:35 Got 👌💥💥💥
Unexpected 😭😭😭😎🎉
Epilepsy seizures
Crazy
This shockingly looks waaaaay better than I thought it would
What's up doc feels like more from the morbius trailer when vulture says it ...
I would be sad if there is no cameo from either Michael Jordan or Bill Murray. But they're better at least be a reference to Michael Jordan if he's not in it.
You have to admit...this looks a lot better than expected!
#RESTORETHESNYDERVERSE
This looks like it’ll be a better Ready Player One sequel than the actual Ready Player One sequel
So no Penelope?? >:(
Wtfff xD
This seems awful.
So this is the basket ball version of Ready Player One and Mega Man NT Warrior? I'm good
Not gonna lie the visual looks great Lebrons acting needs a lot of work tho it’s off putting watching him act it’s like a outa body experience watching him act it’s that bad
They really did "upgrade" Lola.
I never knew there was Hanna-Barbera characters in this Looney Tunes movie.
Every time they earn more, and more visits, because we look for cameos that we could not see the first time. What a great trick. 🤣😂 The MASK vs TAZ 🌪 🙏 #RestoreTheSnydeverse #RestoreTheSnydeverse #RestoreTheSnydeverse
I just hope that Michel Jordan, Bill Murray, or The MonStars at least make some sort of appearance in this. Cause otherwise that would make me sad.
Totally looking forward to this!!! 🤩
1:42 after Drogon left Kingslanding, he went to go see the toons play ball
Bro, when did this become Ready Player One 2 lol. Went 0-100 real fast, remember when this franchise started from a commercial for sneakers lol
What the hell is doing Rhodey there?? Is that stark tech?
That was amazing and outstanding looks more better than the first space jam movie.
1:45 is that legendary's kong or the 1933 kong
Pretty good trailer but....I see no Lola Bunny cleavage 😪
"Pete, send this clown to Brazil!"
D Wade playing Lola Bunny 🔥😂
Lebron James is such a bad actor. He should stick to basket ball
Yikes, this looks and sounds really bad.
I can't wait to wait it
Not The Droogs💀🤣🤣🤣 2:23
Ok this makes me more interested in the movie and the Warner Brothers and Hanna Barbera references
Ready player space jam?
So this is space jam ft every cartoon character ever made by Warner bros
My kids are going bananas for this one. I guess after being home sick for months something exciting just open up for them.
THIS LOOKS SICK! I Can't Wait To See This In July
Warner Play salve
Makes me just want to watch the original
Wasnt expecting to see Don Cheadle as the villain  Gotta admit this looks HELLA FUNNN
Ready Player One but in basketball
This is what The Lego Movie was afraid to do... DID EVERYONE SEE DROGON? OMGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Looks like could be some jolly fun with Iron Giant, Kong, and all the looney tunes with Senior discount jokes in basketball.
0:33 Dr Strange?
This has no right to look as awesome as it is.
Of course Lebron needs a Superteam.
Oof
Didn't think we'd see a Godzilla vs. Kong rematch so soon!
This looks like garbage compared to the first movie, another remake to fleece the masses. Now I see why Warner is against the Snyderverse, they dislike good movies. Makes so much sense after seeing this trailer and the new Kong movie, they don't have an original bone in their body.
1:38 Bugs rocking the OG jersey from the first movie
#RestoretheSnyderverse
Ready Player one wants their movie back
*FUCKING 2D ANIMATION IS BACK!!!!!*
But pls #restorezacksnyderverse really plss🙏🙏🙏🙏
MJ goat
Kong said fuck Godzilla lemme cash this check by making a quick cameo in Space Jam!
lets hope space jam the new legacy won;t became like one of them as "the worst kids film that tried to be great film by using classic cartoons"
Looks pretty awesome, but I still hope they have the original song in the movie
Holy crap. Ready Player One 1/2
LeBron could've deliverd A LOT of those lines better
1:43 They even have the yetis from Smallfoot here. They're really going all-in on the cameos, aren't they?
1:41 WAS THAT DROGON?!?!?!
Who want to Watch this MOVIE this year ? Oh c'mon SPACE JAM. THUMBS UP FOR JAMES FAN.
Oh. Well, okay then. Let's hope this is any better than the Tom & Jerry film.
Looks like it's time to slam and jam once again
Ready Player Ball
His son name is Dom?
No no no no
Never thought I’d see a Clockwork Orange reference in a Space Jam movie but here we are...
This movie looks 🔥. Why tf coming 2 America look like some booty but space jam 2 look like it’s gonna be one of the best movies in 2021
Damn
At least he's slightly better acting then Michael Jordan. Not by much! LeBron James is a really really bad actor, but little kids won't care.
Please release in telugu 🙏🏻🔥
WTF...this actually looks like something worth watching 😮
Ohh this movie is like ready player one all characters from different movie is merged i will watch this movie soon
I just saw this trailer yesterday while seeing Godzilla Vs Kong and I'm really excited.  This is the movie I've been waiting for and I can't wait to see Lola Bunny again.
I want a Looney Tunes Back In Action 2
Where my boy Pepe le pew u better not have canceled him just to be "woke"
This looks really cool!  As much I liked the original, I think this one's gonna be awesome!  I look forward to seein' it!
Drogon got so pissed about season 8 he became a cartoon
This shit already makes the original look like a masterpiece.
Exciting level fucking sooo high🔥🔥💪
New contender for the worst thing ever made.
Oh lord! What did they do to my Lola 🐰.
Am I the only one that would rather a remake of the original then this?
1:41 they brought in Flintstones before the Scoob! franchise had a chance to
As if the whole loonacity of it all wasnt enough... DON. CHEADLE. IS. THE. VILLIAN. This is ridiculous and has all my attention!
Ready Player One 2?
The trailer music is actually so good
@ 1:46 next to Pennywise is thay Arnold's schwarzenegger mr.freeze? Lol
King James doing one for the kids as well as the kid in all of us! Love it
The looney toons characters look a little stiff
#restorethesnyderverse
More like “Ready Baller One”
King Kong and the Iron Giant appearing honestly made me laugh harder than it should've lol
Think if joker and Godzilla is also in the movie
This is why i love Looneytunes but i hope all the cameos dont ruin the movie for me
LOOKS GRATE! I was worried lol
2:14 might be Lebron's most embarrassing moment in his career 😅🤣
This seems like an over packed reach.. I’m not excited about this..
R.I.P. Pepe Le Pew's career.  We want the Pepe Cut!
horrible
Lola Bunny = D Wade
If they are going to cancel my favorite cartoons, I too will cancel this movie with my money.
Reference to ready player one
Ready player one: Avengers Space Jam
No aguanto las ganas de verla!!
This is a good reason why bring back theater.
will watchthis if this is available in youtube...why? coz my country is still in lockdown!!
RIP Pepe and Lola bunny
Can’t wait to see it. This movie looks good
Don't mess granny
2:04 Wade to LeBron alley with Lola doing the Wade pose.
WHERES STEPH CURRY
The trailer looks amazing but ask him about China
Yo, is that DaBaby?! Also I'm cheering for Granny.
So, Ready Player One: Basketball then.
What the fuck this is just a sequel for Emoji movie goddamn!
1:18 On the white board, Superman, Gandalf, King Kong, Iron Giant. OMG really waiting for this movie.
I give it to em dis look🔥🔥🔥
EVERYONE IS HERE
Don't forget to #restorethesnyderverse
What did they do to my poor lola
Wtf is king kong doing there? Lebron should've recruited godzilla 🤣
No. It doesn't look good at all.
Reminds me when I went to the theater to see Space Jam as a kid. Props to Coogler: this brother is attached to so many amazing blockbuster movies outside of Black Panther, like this, Judas and the Black Messiah, and so many more projects.

This looks absolutely terrible 🤮
Honestly I don't think this looks good, it reminds me too much of Ready Player One, and that is completely different movie that shouldn't be listed in the same sentence as Space Jam unless you're listing Warner Bros. movies. The first Space Jam was a 90s comedic classic that didn't need a sequel and should exist on its own, but now we're getting this heap of trash. This movie looks like it's going to let us all down and I'm sure it will. Will I watch it, yeah, will I like it, most likely not.

Overheard in the Toon Squad locker room after the scrimmage.   “She got me,” LeBron said of Lola Bunny’s dunk over him. "That f***ing Bunny boomed me."  LeBron added, “She’s so good,” repeating it four times.  LeBron then said he wanted to add Bunny to the list of players he works out with this summer.

This bald bastard is not worthy of MJs movie. This should have been KOBE!!!!!
Ripoff
Game of Thrones, The Wizard of Oz, Tune World, Gotham City and Metropolis,  Warner Brothers. Lot, The Iron Giant. Hanna-Barbera characters, King Kong, The Mask (Stanley Ipkiss). Is there any other reason to be excited for this long-awaited sequel?!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🌪🌪🎶🎶🦇🦇🏀🏀☄☄
is that RDJ?? 1:45
I can't believe LOLA is in 3D
fuck this. i was on board when it was 2D, the CGI makes this look like trash
#restorethesnyderverse Warner Bros.
REMEMBER WHAT THEY TOOK FROM YOU
Is this Ready Player One DLC?
I'm still pissed with lola bunny 90's lola is the shit
It ain’t the same without thicc Lola bunny😩
Won't be watching 1. Lebron is woke SJW 2. Looks terrible
I see 3 other NBA players ... Anthony Davis ... Klay Thompson and Damian Lillard.
When Daffy said "shoot the ball", yeah I need to watch how I word things from now on.
Ready player one: we're the biggest crossover of Warner bros history and nothing can change that. (still agree with that to this day.) Space Jam 2: What's up doc? hold my basketball. also, can i just go ahead and mention right now that the plot is nothing i would have imagined?
This actually looks pretty great
This actually looks amazing
Kong went to chill and play ball after fighting Godzilla. He deserved some time off tbh.
I like it!!!
Gunna suck lol
#Restorethesnyderverse WE WILL NEVER STOP!
This look like a travis scott music video lol
1:44  2:18 is no one gonna talk about the about the characters from small foot and the mask in the movie  Edit: 0:36 I just noticed the planets he flys past are game of thrones and Alice in wonderland
Larry Bird's grandma!
This is so ridiculous, so over the top and I can't wait
I’m not the only one who’s pausing the trailer and see who are in the crowds, right?
imagine being so bored you scroll down and find my comment
What the hell happened to lola
I’m here for it!!!!
A movie that's classic 2D animation and modern 3D animation at the same time? Already excited!
Quite similar with the movie "Toonpur ka superhero"
ayyy yosemite has his guns
That's why Warner doesn't have the money to make a Snyder cut part 2, look at this man, money, money, money
this looks. really bad
#restorethesnyderverse
WB, what have you done with my childhood? :(
WARNER BROTHERS YOUR AWESOME
Wooow!
This movie better play the theme song
Rip Lola 😥
Nós do Brasil 🇧🇷 amamos The Warner Bros ❤️ including Looney Tunes.
Fine... I’ll watch it 😂
1:44 This is a *Certified Kong Moment*
Happy Birthday to me.
1:42-is that freaking Drogon?!?!?!?
Ready Player Space Jam?
Space trash : an unnecessary reboot that just earns that chinese schill lebron more money (avoid at all costs).
RL GRIME!!!!!
And they say endgame is the most ambitious crossover.
They better pay their respects to Kobe in this #24
Disney: Wreck it ralph will have the most pop culture references Warner: the lego movie combined with it's spinoff the lego batman movie plus ready player one will have the most pop culture references. Disney: Wreck it ralph 2 will have the most pop culture references combined with the first one. Warner: Did I forget to mention the lego movie 2 will have double the amount of that? Along with the fact that the upcoming sequel to space jam will be jam packed with pop culture references? Disney: You make me mad you rascally rabbit! Warner: I know do Roger.
Gay.....
i really love the idea of switching styles between universes, where the toonverse is hand drawn and the real world is three-dimensional. we never got to see michael jordan as a looney tune, so this is a really cool concept! all the animation is so fluid and the whole premise sounds very interesting. i can’t wait! :)
OMG A MARVEL CHARACTER IN WARNER BROS THIS IS AMAZING
I was one of those "Just let classics be classics and stop rebooting everything" people, but not going to lie, this looks pretty awesome.
HYPE!!!!
Is it...is it actually possible I'll actually be able to sit through this to the end credits??? WHAT BLACK MAGIC HAS WARNER BROTHERS CAST ON ME?!?
Leb🔥
1:17 LeGMMMMMM back at it!
This Movie is about: The Tutorial to Defeat Disney+
#restorethesnyderverse
I hope to see meatcanyon’s wabbit season because it is canon
Perfect Kong appears, he already won my ticket to go see her
SCOOBY DOO, IRON GIANT, FLINTSTONES, YOGI BEAR, SmallFoot Are HERE!!! Let's GO!!
Really really hoping Revival By Zomboy & Mustdie is in this movie, it would fit so perfectly in a climax scene for a movie like this, somebody said there was a rumor that it was gonna be but I’m pretty sure they were just joking
Imagine watching this movie just high outta your fucking mind 😂😂
Ready Player One in the form of Basketball!!!
why is kong here and why does he have his sound effects from GVK
Laaaamme.
''DAMN THE GRANDMA GOT MORE CAKE THEN LOLA'' this comment was quoted
My childhood is back after 25 years!
Space jam level  2
Even in here LeBron is looking to form a super team
no mires Roma Gallardo
So war machine is the bad guy  Capt Micheal Burnham of the uss discovery of start trek is lebron a new wife and baby mom Aka their using all the toons and nearly every monster WB has rights too  They over did this movie
Just another thing for Jordan to be better than him at.  LeBron is dumber than the capital B in his name.

1:53   Jack Nicholson Joker in the Background...
I was really hopeful about this movie. This trailer looks awful though.
Ready player 2 looks amazing
Bet Will Smith ain't gotta deal with this
Soooo, Ready Player One but with a basketball?
Is this gonna challenge the greatest game ever played? (Space Jam)
The Looney Tunes are Rejects? How dare you sir! Looks like a fun film, eager to see it!
They put all the cartoon characters and the characters from adult tv shows/movies in a kids movie.
WOAH THEY GOT WAY TOO MUCH BUDGET
That’s the westworld rehoboam wow
#restorethesnyderverse
1:53 Love the Taurasi reference as the White Mamba
Ready Player One vibes and I'm here for it!
Resdy player one on crack

lola ain’t thicc that’s my only problem
I wonder how many dislikes are gonna be because of the hatred of Bron rather than their distaste of the trailer or movie
Well that ... actually kinda sucks. I mean it’s just a trailer but it looks nothing like the first one. And I I don’t mean the visuals (though seriously why would you do a 3D Bugs Bunny, why?!) or the Story (No one wants the exact same story) but just the kind of movie it is.
Good but movie made for the kids Disney never made the movie like this this is the nice crossover between all the characters
Honestly thought Don Cheadle was Kevin Hart
This looks really cool. I like how they animated LeBron James for part of the movie. And it's cool that Don Cheadle's in the movie too. All the animated effects look do epic. I'm even more excited for the movie now.
Marvel: "Infinity War is the most ambitious crossover"  WB: "Hold my basketball"
Lit but yall did my girl Lola wrong
So no Monstars?
War Machine was in space jam ?
This is what the world looks like when your high
>No sexy Lola >Whats the fucking point.
Why wasn't Michael Jordan a Cartoon  in the first movie ? 🤨
Jaw dropping
well, holy shit
THE FACT THAT THEY USED MONSTERVERSE KONG-
Man this might get cool.
2:11
The team they should’ve had them go against is golden state 💀
pepe le pew we remember you
Space Jam was once one my all time favorite movies but I can't lie, my hype for this was slowly dying because of all the negative articles I kept reading and I was so disappointed and basically underwhelmed but after seeing this trailer  HOLY  FUCKING  SHIT.  THIS LOOS AMAZING.
Writer of the movie: so how many pop culture characters do you want in this movie?  Director: Y E S
It's like Ready Player One meets NBA 2k
So its Space Jam mix with Who Framed Rogger Rabbit without Disney mix with Ready Player One
Y

That Wade reference tho
1:46 Penny Wise from IT, Monkeys from Wizard of OZ, Mr. Freeze from Batman, MIB, Morpheus from the Matrix.
i got goosebumps watching this.
Fr should've had savannah bronny and bryce in there
Space Max : A New Streamer
Disney: Ok so we have to make the ugliest character design possible for our live action adaptation WB:
The amount of Memes this movie will create will supply Twitter for a decade
Love from India ❤️😍🥰🤩
was that Drogon?!!
Half the budget for this movie went to LeBron James' acting coach and reshoots for him
It actually looks not terrible
im so happy ill get to see the iron giant in the movie same with kong
Oh god, there's a sequal..
Kingkong and superman?😂
So...ready player two
This looks very not good.
It’s coming to a Chinese theater near you lol
Spacejam goes all BLACK.......yup its 2021......
LOL
Wait! What?
0:48 he is right in front of you 🤨
So that's it?... We're some kind of Space Jam?
This is like WBs / CNs Ralph breaks the internet movie
Doesn't it seems like ready player one
This looks awful.
2:14  Space Ghost on the far right
I love that they actually animated LeBron
Should have guessed Ryan coogler was behind this. Smh.
Omg I thought I never see a sequel to space jam ever this looks fun and enjoyable can’t wait to see it
You think Lola bunny is still the girlfriend of bugs? And is this a reboot?
So... THIS is what James Rhodes is doing now after the death of Tony Stark...
This Lola Bunny just doesn’t hit the same. Know what I mean?
The fact that Lola Bunny did the dwyane wade pose when bron was about to dunk is dope as hell
This movie looks completely insane
This latest Tron reboot is crazy
Michael Jordan when not asked to return for the sequel: "So I took that personally."
Looks like ready player one means Looney tunes! 😆
This makes Ready Player One look like Citizen Kane.
Lola Bunny. Not again.
Cameo: the movie!  This looks sick!!!
2:27 *Damian Lillard*
Omg all the cameos and references make me happy
I don't know guys. It feels just a bit too similar to Ready Player One. Three dimensional Lola's looking pretty hot though so I'm still gonna go see it despite how derivative it looks.
Noice
Was anyone else thinking “WTF is happening” while watching this
I don't even think Lola looks that bad tbh
F for Lola
Feels like a mashup of Ready Player One and the original Space Jam
WAIT!! Ryan coogler is working on this movie? Um.. Okay... I'm watching it!
Who’s Klay Thompson’s character? One of the goon squad? Wasn’t sure if it was the one in Flames
Why does this look so similar to Ready Player One
Dude, looks like a terrible movie... The First one was amazing by Its simplicity, this one looks like a push over.
#restorethesnyderverse
Infinity war is the most ambitious crossover in history Me:
road to a mickey mouse box office weekend
WB's official canon Multiverse movie
1:39 the mystery machine!!!!!
If academy award  have the most hype trailer award Warner bros Must be nominated every year
This looks bonkers! I’m crossing my fingers for this sequel to be good.
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Shut up and take my money!
Yes!!! Yes!!! Yeeessss!!! Best thing to do is not compare movies just enjoy the ones coming out. We had our generation of space jam and I'm glad to be alive for round 2.
Ok..... The callback the D. Wade assist is pretty awesome
2:10 Dwyane Wade's imitation pose by Lola is such an amazing moment to NBA fan ❤️
That's lit.
But I think I’ll see suicide squad instead
1:39 Iconic Nostalgia starts here
No Michael Jordan, because you're weak.
No matter how good this will be IMDB will show no more than 6.00 rating becouse of the Jordan fans.
2:16 ITS TIME FOR ANIMANIACS
This looks like it was made with love and appreciation for the original. I can't believe this is actually happening.
Iron Giant? Just take my money
It would be great if the Iron Giant has a scene with Superman.
I wish they got Jordan to do a cameo
This looks awesome
🤩
Kong got bored being in the hollow earth he like let me go watch LeBron played some basketball
Daffy duck :- ''shoot the ball'' Sam:- literally shoots the ball n duck  The duck b like;- I should have not called you for training
Some Hidden References: Game of Thrones - Night King - Dragon Superman Kong Gandalf (The lord of the rings) The Iron Giant Matrix pennywise Mad Max Scooby Doo The Flintstones Shark King Joker ...
I already see some of these people turning into fortnite skins lmao
1:45 Kong: (Shows Up In Space Jam 2)  Godzilla: (ANGRY SKREEONK NOISES)
kong go to other movies to learn new technique to beat godzilla ass next time
I CANT STOP WATCHING XD
Man,whatever it is,I'm just happy to see the Looney Tunes on the big screen again!
1:41 is that Drogon from GOT?
So many WB property characters in the background. Im glad to say that Warner Bros is making a comeback these past 2 years. Warner Bros used to feel so big back in my day. When you saw that logo on a trailer or when a movie started, you felt that big Hollywood movie sensation
I'm 31 fucking years old. I did not anticipate how excited I would be for this movie. I hope Michael Jordan has a cameo.
This film truly marks the age of a new legacy!!!
Taken and Avengers x Space Jam
thiiiss is ganna bee baad 😬
So... WB’s Ralph Breaks the Internet? A bunch of fun IP?
Im officially seven year old again. Thanks WB, exploring people's nostalgia sometimes just works out.
This shit looks so terrible, he Tryna be mj so bad, he can’t act
They’re probably actually using every single Warner Bros. property by the looks of it. They for some reason referenced Small Foot as if anyone would remember what that movie was.
Ngl, this actually looks intense and really good. With all the different cameos and characters from other universes other this better be awesome.
Feels more like a live-action version of Wreck it Ralph! But man I am excited to see this movie I’m sure LeBron James is going be great in this film. And where’s Jim Carrey’s The Mask supposedly he’s coming back in this.
#restorethedynderverse
Lola Bunny with the D.Wade lob thooo!! 🔥🔥🔥
So Yosemite Sam can shoot his guns in the movie, but Elmer can't have his shotgun on the new series? Lame!
1:58 Dudley!!!
What happened to Lola?!
Ready Player Two: Looney Tunes Back in Action
Looks great!
Daffy: "sam, shoot the ball" Sam: so anyway I started blasting
Omg this is gonna be dope and its will be released on my birthday✨.July 16 here we go 🙌
#restorethesnyderverse
Don’t show us nothing else !, this is more then enough excitement ! This looks good and this is a perfect hype train .
Spacey player Jam
If there were this many white people in one movie Twitter would go crazy... unbelievable.
It looks great
And this  guy  is suppressed black guy
This is phenomenal. But I think it would be more badass if Lebron James didn't turn in the cartoon like Michael Jordan in the first Space Jam. But this is just a trailer so I'm very excited to watch this movie 🍿
1:17    bron really thought he gonna get that lineup in toon world
I kinda hope there will be a nod to the looney toons remembering Michael Jordan or something similar
One word: Childhood
Where is the iron giant 2
Look how they massacred my childhood...
Is amazing
Just saw the Animaniacs!!
This joke just destroyed a classic. I love how lebron preaches equality but here he goes making a movie with no white people stars. Funny how he doesn't practice what he preaches.
It’s cool that they didn’t even show the cameo stars
What a crap... And we all know, Don Cheadle is the son of LeBron.  Un bon gros nanard de merde. Et on sait tous que Don Cheadle est le fils de LeBron.
I always envisioned the WB/HB/CN cartoons to be part of the same universe  due to the numerous crossovers in their shows, bumpers and games. Glad to see this is still a thing. WM doesn't have to build a cinematic universe. They already have one.
This looks fricking awesome
Not sure how you go from battling aliens in a game of basketball to battling “goons” in a game of basketball in the “sever-verse”. The title makes even less sense than the first one.
# restore the snydervesre
meeeh every time they reboot this kinda shit it's always awful :/
1:42 Smaug
Did anyone notice Scooby-Doo and his gang  behind there in 2:23 part?
Now this is a real Jam trailer
Glad to see the hand-drawn animation again. Hope they made Lola Bunny hot lol.
No Animaniacs?
🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
How is it Space Jam 2 is gonna use Iron Giant better than Ready Player One?
Did someone say ready player one but basketball
the bron jame
OK we're all thinking it let's just address it. Anyone thinking that they are gonna faceoff against the Disney crew in the third Space Jam?
Looks whack.
This movie is now my number 2 most anticipated movie, right behind mortal kombat.
For everyone who wants to know the name of the song, it's called "Scylla" from RL Grime
Still have my bugs bunny plush from 96 . I’ll give the new movie a chance
This gives ready player one a run for it’s money
Fail off my chair on 2:18! 🤣
1:46 Scooby Doo is in the bottom right corner
If Michael Jordan doesn't get a cameo in here this movie is for nothing
I feel like they should call this "Who Framed Roger Rabbit: Warner Bros. Edition"
Holy shit this looks like a giant space turd.
Also I wish that Micheal Jordan was in the movie sitting in the back of the row watching this whole basketball extravaganza in Film. literally.
We've definitely come a long way, this is an absolute banger. The first one was a classic tho not gonna lie. Can't wait!
1:42 you Vinesauce fans will thank me

Okay cool, but where’s AD, Klay, CP3 and Dame D.O.L.L.A.?

we've been waiting for this for so long
1:24 An average American playing basketball
This movie gonna be lit
WB: Hey remember that CG Iron Giant from Ready Player One? We still have that on file right?
This looks cool. Regardless of this being good or bad, nothing can beat the original that was a classic. LeBron seems to be a good actor.
The movie looks ok but what I am really liking is all references to other Warner bros properties
THIS SPACE JAM REMIX IS VERY AWESOME AND STYLISH!!!!! CAN YOU RELEASE IT PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!! I SUPER LOVE IT!!!!!!
Brilliant, just brilliant
1:39 THE MYSTERY MACHINE
I love Space Jam 🤩
1:53 anyone else spot joker in the background to the right?
wheres my boy pepe lepew??
Looks good loved the first movie saw it when I was 13 in 1997 on vhs🕹
I’m sitting here like a dumbass looking for the Animaniacs.
Aye it’s byrce
The nostalgia is hitting me all over the place, but this feel more like "Ready Player One" did a sequel and not Space Jam😅😁
LeBron acts pretty well. Good delivery of lines. Probably why he flops so welll...
Super random, but I legit had a Space Jam dream last night. So coincidence I woke up to this lol
I swear i saw.. jr smith, dame lillard,sue bird, candance parker & klay Thompson 🤷🏿‍♂️
2:22 why are the Clockwork Orange gang in the background WTF
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa q massa
Other than Lola bunny this movie looks great and full of nostalgia.
Super smash bros ultimate dlc leak 1:39
Its Ralph breaks the internet all over again.
Nothing against anyone but wtf is this ready player 1 wanna be bs  this is a travesty to the original this is an assault on the eyes
Can't wait until Lebron's daddy Chairman Xi comes looking for him and saves the day.
Ready Player One who?
this is too much ... I need to processed this ...
#restorethesnyderverse
Lebron feels awkward in the form of acting
Will there be snake jazz??
Listen Gen Z kids! You better kid out of my way when this movie comes out in theatres! I've been waiting 20 years for this movie!!!!!
Those jerseys are fresh as hell!! 🔥🤌🏾
It needs Pepe Le Pew.
That's Very Interesting to see the Looney Tunes Back in Theaters and Unfortunately Pepe Le Pew will not make an Appearance Because of Controversy so Yeah.
2:14 Greetings Citizens, I'm Space Ghost!
Avengers Infinity War: I'm the most ambitious crossover in history  Space Jam: hold my carrot, Dock.
That robot that was tripping the ball really fast look like Damian Lillard from the Portland Trailrail Blazers and the bird character looks like Anthony Davis
Lola bunny : 1:20 / 1:23 / 1:47 / 1:58 / 2:04 / 2:10
1:46 look at the faces of IT and Agent Smith.. we're getting the cosplay versions of the characters. So, i guess no Jim Carrey as The Mask 😪
Only way it could ever live up to the insanity of the original
No offence but #Restorethesnyderverse.
DA KANG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SCREW EVERYTHING ELSE, DROGON LETS GOOOOOO!!!
This shit feel like ready player one
Funny they reused the exactly same CGI modeling of The Iron Giant from Ready Player One movie. You can see the Giant's legs are still partly unfinished.
Crash Bandicoot would fit in this perfectly
MY CHILDHOOD RETURNS
Lebron: what you do to my son where's don                                                          Me: right in front of you
James is garbage
Look at that cgi hair line...
Wtf he is a basketball player I thought after watching this trailer he is an professional actor ?
Is it still April Fools?
I like seeing a bunch if characters at once, like in Ready Player One.
Good job guys you fucked up another movie shit by 2030 you will fuck up every movie that was good but i will say it is gonna be good for this generation since everything is trash anyway
Yeah...this looks dope
Quando eu era moleque assisti o Space Jam original só umas 350 vezes

This shit looks more stupid than CNN Cartoon Network
No pepe le pew, no party 🧐
A moment of silence for the people that COVID got and will never be able to see this
You know how the 2010s took everything we loved and shat on it and marketed on nostalgia? Maybe let's come up with new ideas and make new memories.
Gg ruining Lola and saying women with breast can’t play sports. Sexists.
1:46 - Flying Monkey And Pennywise
Looks decent enough, maybe might be a good or great movie
The furries are gonna love this
Enough people will watch this cringey movie to get its box office collection to more than $1B🤦
That had no business being that cool.
2:10 that Bron and Wade reference
Looney Tunes, LeBron James and Ryan Coogler? 2021 is really wanting  to make up for 2020.
Just like old days

This looks like it will suffer from a distinct lack of Bill Murray, Michael Jordan, and well fun.
I love seeing the cameos 🔥
Looks both better and worse than I was expecting
jesus, shit man god damn, looks like crap
Any one see the moment when Lola turned after throwing the lob to bron and put her hands up.  That was the same moment from when Dwayne wade threw lebron a lob on the heat
2:23 - the white walkers!
1:58 it appears daffy isn’t playing
Lebron: Where's Don?  The king of the domain:Well Im don cheadle so do I count?
There will be  lot of Fun @Space Jam
I hope Michael Jordan makes a cameo.
Michael Jordan is not taking this personally.. he’s laughing.
Instant classic
This looks like a Warner Brothers Appreciation Party, and I kinda like that.
Im smiling like an idiot rn oml Im so excited for this!!!

I'm just gonna watch this movie As soon it will come out  I don't care about the Cancelation of Pepe le pew or any other stuff that involves internet Drama I'm just gonna enjoy watching it even if some people say its a bad movie
🐐👑
Haters gonna hate but that’s their problem. Michael Jordan may not be in there but this is LeBRON we seeing here. It’s a sequel titled A NEW LEGACY.
Anyone notice the lebron and d wade alley oop dunk towards the end of the trailer
Is it Space Jam 2 or Ready Player Two?
The mask.  2.18.  Back round
This its not a sequel at all this is just a reboot
This looks so stupid and I want to see it
Donald duck yeah.... 😍😍
Ready Player LebrOne
Alrighty, I saw the trailer dropped already and got excited. I love the first one. So, I'm having high hopes for this. And I don't generally have high hopes for anything, especially basketball. But this looks pretty good.
Less is more dude, yall added too much shit and cgi stuff
Looks really fun
This looks terrible
Sucks... should of used the MONSTARS where they steal all the new basketball players moves...
Wasn't expecting to see the Iron Giant, King Kong, or the Hanna Barbera characters.
LeBron James should be nominated for Oscar
Lebron is A GIFTED ACTOR AND this shit gon be A BETTER READY PLAYER ONE pour moi
Loony tunes RTX on
BASKETBALL KINGDOM HEARTS   BASKETBALL KINGDOM HEARTS

Nice trailer Now #RestoreTheSnyderverse WarnerBors
Cringe as fuck. That`s why MJ will always be the goat.
you know its bad i know its bad BUT the amount of memes we can possibly get HAHAHAHA
Space Jam: A New Legacy is basically  Space Jam meets Ready Player One meets  The Lego Movie!
alternative title: big chungus and basketball player #652 vs. war machine
Yeah I think I'll just stick to the original space jam
As a 90's baby who grew up on the original I gotta say...... I'm all for this.
0:19 "Bet Will Smith ain't gotta deal with this" I don't know it's a Joke or a Sarcasm
#restoresynderverse
I WANT MY OLD SPACE JAM SITE BACK!
So Is war machine supposed to be the bad guy now
I DIDN’T KNOW DAN AYKROYD WAS IN THIS MOVIE
No wonder why this movie took forever to be made!
Eh Where's Michael Jordan at doc ?
Pass, probably China approved Woke Garbage.
China James is such a shill. SAD
😲😀😃
Hey Sam has his guns back!! Okay I'll give it a shot haha get it.
Did Lola do the Dwade-Bron pose?? Dope!

That was so freaking awesome. Though, a few characters were omitted from the trailer, like Marvin, Penelope and Foghorn, but I am sure we'll see them in the 2nd trailer.
I want M.J comeo
1:45 King kong!!! WTF?!  WHERE IS Scooby doo? 😅
*Come on and slam*
Imagine if the Banana Splits made a cameo in this film.
Shoot the ball🤣
Where is speed racer
Waahhhh i can't waitttt

I mean...cool, but you're not gonna beat the OG Tune Squad vs the MonStars
Man..I loves the original Now we're bringing it to the next generation. This is gonna be fun..
“shoot the ball” *literally does it*
wait the memes were real
The first movie was to save the looney tunes from being slaves from moron mountain and get the talent back from the best nba players  The second one about saving LeBron James’s son
This looks so fucking bad lmao
Winged blue man- Anthony Davis Golden player- Damian Lillard Water player- Klay Thompson Fire player- Kyrie Irving
Looks great but would've been better with Korey Coleman on board 🤣
Ready Player Two
The CGI looks great
Its actually good.
This certainly looks big. Here's hoping people really enjoy it.
I'm going to be the odd one and say that this looks... chaotic. Which isn't exactly bad, but... I don't know. It seems like it's a movie that banks it's existence on cameos and flashy colors and there won't be any more flavour besides that.
Ready Player One vibes
Should have been bronny other than that this looks fun
Hollywood version of Toonpur ka Super Hero..... Ahh too late!!!!
Welcome to LIVERPOOL FC LeBron. #YNWA
Wow, it is a sequel to the Original Space Jam but it looks like the Warner bros worlds included the Looney Tunes, Hanna-Barbera Characters and the DC Super Heroes United.
Looks horrid.

COME ON AND SLAM
Wowww childhood 😍😍😍
Jam Player One
Ah shit, here we go again
This looks terrible
Bruh she doing the dwane  wade

The fact that Pennywise is here shows the sheer depth of the cameos they stuffed in here for people to comb through

Damn Kong still had time to go to the game after his last movie
LeGM: Releases Trailer Uncle Shay: G.O.A.T.🐐 JAMES
In the same way Space Jam was the most 90's film ever. This will be the most 2020's film ever. It will age like milk and it will be torn to shreds by anyone and everyone with a Internet access. But let's be honest. You'll all still watch it. And you will give them what they wanted.
ReleasetheKobeCut
I hope MJ 23 will make a cameo in this dope movie !! Space DUNK
My resolution to see every WB movie this yr looking real good
Looks terrible
This looks like a perfect dumb and fun summer flick. Trailer actually made me hype. Very cool how other movie properties are included
Soon to be academy award winner LeBron James
Lebron ain’t even a better actor than MJ 💀
The pure amount of all sorts of characters from so many warner movies is crazy ...  and thats only for the ones i know. Not so pleasant was the discovery of pennywise, some characters they could´ve left out and i would´ve been fine with it. Regardless i´ll most likely watch this movies a couple of times.
He want a crossover team.   Okey,You got it.
I have a bad feeling about this.
#justiceforjohnnydepp #fireamberheard #restorethesnyderverse

Wow I expected this to be absolute dog shit but i came away impressed from this trailer
I SWEAR TO GOD IF BIG CHUNGUS MAKES A CAMEO
Ready Player One with Looney Tunes (with Looney Factor 2%)
Can’t wait!!!
A rip off of the classic movie Space Jam originally made by Michael Jordan
Super excited for this film!! I remember watching the first film back in the cinema!! Can't wait!
THIS LOOKS SO INCREDIBLE! I'M SO HYPED FOR THIS!
This looks so coooool
Let's GOOOOOOO, this will be lit and all the Hanna Barbara cinematic are coming together, can't wait to see this
Looks very cool!
I'm more excited for the mashups people will make... the Slam-Jojo series is still a favourite of mine to this day
CAN. NOT. WAIT!!!!  As a 90s kid, I am STOKED!
wo
0:35   Any Game of thrones fans sticking around here🍻
ALRIGHT!!! Sounds excitin'! I can't wait to watch Space Jam 2!

Whenever I see looney tunes Me: Yes!!!!!
Where is my boi Marvin the Martian tho
Just hope they have Slam of the North Star: Quad city DJ vs Crystal Kings remix bruh

Why the fuck is pennywise a  movie that has bugs bunny  & friends 😭
' I WANT TO BUILD A DREAMTEAM TO      BEAT THE BROOKLYN NETS'   -CLASSIC LBJ
Probably a best movie in 2021 with The Suicide Squad, Godzilla vs Kong and Cruella
I have just one question, WHERE IS BIG CHUNGUS?
After a long time the toon squad is back
Ready Player one ft. Looney Tunes
Who else noticed the word King Kong?
The water tower is here 2:06
I...do not know how to feel about this.
That's the Bunny Basket by King J !!!
1:46 Anyone who saw the pennywise in the background makes it like kkkk 😂
Damn! Emma Webster (aka Granny) got some move. 😎. Awesome! 2:24.
What I liked about this trailer was all the other Warner bros movie characters featured kinda cool!
Lola Bunny throwing it to Bron just like how D. Wade did it is 4th wall breaking genius 🔥
so guess i'm the only one less than excited for this movie. ok then.
Hopefully this is not a flop
"Tune world" ITS TOON WORLD
Space Jam looks like a wannabe Ready Player One.
Warner bros truly is coming out swinging. I love how stupid yet extremely cool this movie looks.
This looks awesome as hell.
Anyone else gonna talk about how heavily this is borrowing from Ready Player One? Even down to the character models? 😅    Don't get me wrong, though, I'm still excited to watch it 😉
Looks like it'll become the Oh My Disney scene from Ralph Breaks The Internet. Does this mean that terrible clickbaity movie buffs who complain about everything that isn't Fury Road or Spider-Verse are going to hate this movie too?
Scoob! And the Hanna-Barbera cinematic universe
Dude the 1st one released before my birth... Super excited for this one
Why 3D ?
Wow another big budget nostalgia film, if you liked Ready player one I’m sure you’ll love this movie.....
HOLY WARNER BROS DIDN'T HOLD BACK THIS GONNA BE HUGE
🤨
The amount of WB properties i saw in the trailer alone is blowing my fucking mind
Wow. Wasn’t expecting it to look to this damn good! Look like a worthy sequel 🔥
Pretty sure this movie is going to be meme at some point.
what in the world....ma brains jammed bud
It will be worse than the original with feminist propaganda added. Same as Star Wars.
Ready Player One: Space Jame: A New Legacy
2:18 The Mask in the corner!!
Wondering if the Nerdlucks(aliens from Space Jam 1) will make an appearance or cameo
Man Ready Player 2 looks pretty good here
Trainwreck was not a fluke, LeBron is actually a decent actor
Ready player twenty three
OH!!!! IM FUCKIN CRYIN & AM HYPED
Yo this actually looks sick
This movie looks crazy bad. Cringe city.
Hopefully Michael Jordan has a cameo 💪
Why do the Looney Tunes start out in cell animation then go cg later? That was a bad idea.
Even WarnerBros knows Lebron is a reject.
Warner Brothers Kingdom Hearts.
Gonna be crazy
That 2:10 DWade imitation :D
Michael Jordan was a better actor imo
1:41 so this is where Drogon went with Daenerys
Not gon lie, I thought I was gonna be disappointed but I actually think this will be re-watchable just like SpaceJam 1
oh no! lebron james is in gantz!
0:35 is that Game of thrones Reference
now LBJ recruiting to beat brooklyn nets today ..
Ready Player And One
Let’s be real this looks good
Lebron james: bugs where the ball?  Don cheadel brings ball  "Boom you looking for this?"
Wow. This looks truly awful.
People hated on this so hard when it was announced because it wasn't the original. People need to stop judging based on nostalgia.
Man this Space Jam Mashup is insane
I’m 30 years old and even I’m hyped to see this movie😂😂
The greatest crossover event ever in history
this looks sooo good . I wasnt expecting this tbh
X_X
I still want some connection to the first one but overall solid trailer. CGI looks top tier!
F Pepe Le Pew :/
uhm, excuse me?? this looks dope, and it doesn't have any right to do so
(RTX on memes coming)
That Dwayne Wade reference at 2:12
ITS 2 FUCKING DDD
Lola just pull the D-wade.
"Lebron once again being carried" yada yada yada
I’m 18 and I am not ashamed to say that I am looking forward to seeing this movie   I even have a Space Jam hat!
it's nice to see Drogon here
JORDAN APPROVES THIS FILM ✅
Absolutely horrible. What happened to the hand drawn characters? Why does everything need to be shitty 3d? Why does this look awful lol
Welcome to "the memes Machine"
To hell with the Snyderverse! I’m gonna see this film in the theatre.
This looks so freaking good!!!
this!
Morpheus, Pennywise, Jack Nicholsons Joker and the Scooby Gang are in this Trailer
I thought there were gonna be anime characters :(
This will decided if he's better than Jordan or not
Alright im hyped 💯
https://youtu.be/vsN5nD8_AK0
Однозначно нравится
lola bunny is still hot
Daffy Is gonna loose His shit when he realise that Donald duck Is the owner of the Warnerverse.  Watch the ducktales reboot you Will get it.

who else feel sad after seeing this and thinking about Michael Jordan
Where's Big Chungus?
Everyone is here

WHAT HAPPENED TO TWEETY BIRD’S VOICE?!?!?!?!?!?

Funnily enough, when I thought of what I wanted Space Jam 2 to be, Ready Player One wasn’t at the top of the list 🙄

0:59-1:11 Does anyone else think of "Fat Albert The Movie" when they see this part?
Yeah this looks epic
How many WB properties do you want to see?  Me: Yes
Is this movie only loony toons with Lebron James from la?
2:30  KICKBALL! KICKBAAAAAAALL
This is ready player one but basketball
1:55 The Goon Squad makes me think of the Sinister Six because there are six of them!  I was also going to say The Fantastic Four  But there are only Four of them!  Kind of like an opposite version of Sue Storm aka The invisible Woman a version of Lola Bunny
2:23 Cheetarah!! 🤩
It looks dumb and silly, just what it needs to be.
My goodness, that's why wb is the greatest and the most epic movie studio on earth.
NO,NO, AND NOOOOOOOOO.

Certified Don Cheadle moment
I wish Michael at least will make a cameo appearance and cheer them on or something
another garbage remake! Try making original movies
Holy fucking shit I can’t wait
This seems overly complicated.
So far I definitely know that the first one is definitely going to be way better than this one
I hope this woke trash will flop Hard
This looks absolutely ridiculous and I am here for it.
Basketball Ready Player One😅
So basically this is Space jam + ready player one
Nic, but old school always rocks❤️
Black peoples Citizen Kane
The WB multi-verse is real! 😲 Now we need a 'Bugs Bunny trolls the Night King' movie.

lebron james is a puppet, definitely going to skip this movie, hope it flops honestly
Was Tom & Jerry making a cameo for that?
Yessir the goat
#restorethesnyderverse
2d and 3d bestiful
Conflicted. I love the Looney Tunes and Space Jam, but know that LeBron has been bowing down to China overlords for past few years so this movie could get released in China.
It's been a while since we've seen 2D animation in a theatrical movie.
This has to been the best day ever because today it's my birthday and the trailer got released today 🎉🎂🎉🎂🎉🎂🎉🎂
So Idk anything about Basketball but if the last one had MJ and he was the GOAT are they saying James is the one who's continuing the legacy cause he's the current GOAT.
Ohhhhh My There Will Be Alot OF M.E.M.E.S After This
REMEMBER KING KONG? REMEMBER HOGWARTS? REMEMBER THE IRON GIANT? I CLAPPED BECAUSE I RECOGNIZED THESE POP CULTURE REFERENCES!
Lebron haters gonna be mad 👀
This is going to be so successful..  In china
Scooby Doo, King Kong, Drogon and  More...I need watch this rght NOW ;)
I Hope the Lola Fanatics are Happy....
Space Jam 2? Or Movie Heroes on the Loose!
Kong was invited but Godzilla no? that is the real reason why Godzilla attacked Kong in GvK!
What in "The Matrix" hell?...😂
I saw Pennywise at 1:46
1:44
역시릅신ㅋㅋ
Y’all should’ve just stopped after the 1st film
Anyone else notice the pennywise cameo? Lmk when you see it 👀 🎈
I see that besides other fictional characters, there is also War Machine...
This movie is a excuse for Warner Bros to finally use all the characters and universes they own and just put it into a movie. AND I LOVE IT
Do u know if that song is out?
Bill Murray better show up. I think he's probably recovered from his knee injury by now.
This movie gonna be cringey AF. Love it
Imagine watching this in 3D IMAX👀
READY PLAYER TWO?? Too many Easter Eggs!
Hyped af
I would've preferred tune squad vs WB villains but this looks good
This is the most ambitious crossover
no...just no...looks so cliche...looks like its trying to do a ready player one and that was a shit movie
Everybody get up it's time to slam now.
We Asked for the SNYDER VERSE not the SERVER VERSE!    Looks good tho   #Restorethesnyderverse
And yet the fuck up Lola bunny and where’s Pepe
But where are the little aliens ?
What the fuck did they do to Lola bunny??
Lebron Fucking James!!! Ah ah ah !!!
Oo my goodness this shit is looking super amazing 👌👌👌♥️💃🕺
Now I gotta rewatch the first one for old times sake
I'm more of a bugs fan than lebron
Feel like this movie is gonna be missing a good plot point when it comes to the game/goon squad. this just feels like a pick up game
Ralph Breaks the Internet meets Tron
"Send this clown to the rejects" 😄
Why did they replace Bronny with Kent Bazemore’s son?
How the hell is game of thrones in this?!
Damn this is looking like a double wide surprise
Back to the Day, when Space Jam first aired with Michael Jordan and Looney Tunes, I was really keen and excited, to watch this Film, cause it was sooo good. This, looks like a bad Joke to me now, although I was excited at first, because I believed, it would be a continuation, of the first Film. No need for me, to go into the Cinema for this. 🎦🙈💥👊
Finally WB pictures got to know how to use colours in movies!
Kevin Durant isn't the villain? Guess he'll appear in Space Jam 3 vs. Zion Williamson.
I guess the controversy behind this movie and Pepe Le Pew has fizzled out
the new Ready Player One looks neat
doesn't look awful. but I hope they have 2D animation next to 3D humans. that's where the charm existed in the original.  also I hope LeBron James isn't the only human playing
For some reason I thought Kong, superman, Gandalf would be the opponent team 😅
Im see her Rick And Morty Space Ship And The scene in the Hanna barbera chacters run see her steven univers and small foot chacters
NO ASS IN LOLA BUNNY???? IM OUT

so i'm guessing they're just not going to address the looney toons world at the center of the Earth, like in the original? smh
This trailer is awesome! Well done Granny! Lovely wink from Lola! Guess this is also going to be Fred Flintstone first time watching Basketball  Seeing Shoes for the first time!!
Pog
Seeing Bugs Bunny and the others back makes me happy. The CGI versions will take time to get used to but I'm optimistic overall.
This is better than I expected

Nobody: Movie trailer channels: Leonardo DiCaprio pointing meme at every easter egg in the Space Jam 2 trailer 😂
1:41
Love To See Our All Cartoons Again 😍❤️💕
OMG THEY INCLUDED THE IRON GIANT NOBODY TALKS ABOUT THAT MOVIE ANYMORE
Where is Kobe Bryant? Oh wait
Meh
Lola Bunny 🤝 D Wade 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This looks ridiculous in a good way
superman, gangdalf, king kong and iron giant  cool
The bad guys are Fortnite skins
Boom you lookin for this
I dont understand why lebron in looney tune land becomes animated but michael jordan didnt?
yo this trailer is mad!!!
Screw Beijing Lebron. Kobe should have been filling MJs place. RIP.   Also #Restorethesnyderverse
That song is great!
Goat
1:46 I thought it's RDJ for a second, right behind Don!
This is what happened when rhodey get stark technologies
Michael Jordan making a cameo would be amazing.
Isekai black edition
Yosemite Sam has guns... Now I'm interested
2:07 the mask the penguin the riddler and mib
I saw scooby and his friend's.
LIT
Where is MJ??
LeBron’s top acting skills😂
👑 Everything in this has me sold! 🥕
The plot is gonna be super generic, but it doesn't look bad.
you would make this but not #restorethesnyderverse ?
2:16 Lebron flopping again 😂
Jordan: and that was it for warner.... I took it personal.
I see Ready Player Two came around early this year.
omg is that Smaug?
I’d like to take a moment of silence to the computers that had to render all of this
I can imagine Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz characters being there.
Wait, the Looney Tunes are the "rejects"? And looks like they forgot how to play from the last movie.  Is this really a sequel or a reboot? Well if Jordan or Bill Murray make some cameo and has some lines for it I guess.
Ready Player Two lookin' lit, didn't expect the Barkley Shut Up and Jam Gaiden crossover elements, but I guess anything's an improvement over the first one.    Now where's my Space Jam 2 trailer?
Toto, I Had A Feeling That’s Not Michael Jordan Anymore.
OH NO SHE WINKED EVERYBODY RUN
All these Hanna-Barbera characters.....just reminds me of a *Boomerang* that never came back.....
What In The Matrix Hell Is This?
Ngl this looks lit af!
this looks.....really not good
i thought Don Cheadle gonna cross on James
I thought they weren't going to have guns in looney tunes anymore
The amount of cameo breakdown videos that are about to come.
Ready Player One: Cartoon Edition
So is this supposed to be the sequel to Space Jam or Ready Player One? Because one of those movies was the pustules on a memberberry's ass and this movie looks to be emulating that formula of shit... 😒
Why was James a cartoon when MJ never was?
now THIS is a warmachine story
Looks a hell of a lot better than Ready Player One
Though I hated the first movie, I might give this a shot. My expectation will be low, but I'll give it a shot. All I was expecting the 2D part to be like Klaus, but go off I guess.
What happened war machine has to deal with tonys death......damn
#restorethesnydercut
Pass
oh shit 🔥
LABRON JAMES
A new generation of Slam Jam remixes shall rise...
Meh. I’ll watch from home. I would’ve paid for Michael in sj2
Anyone else liked the Dwane Wade reference with Lola bunny
This is way better than I expected!
100k views
This is the spiritual sequel to ready player one and im lovin it
not a white person in the whole trailer: if the opposite had happened there would be a racist scandal, but it is useless to complain, now they are in charge, the fucking politically correct
I can't wait to see this!
See here I forgot that Lebron James can actually act well, though I do kinda hope he'll stay human for most of the movie like it shows
1:38-1:46 I wonder if this is gonna be the start of a Hanna-Barbera Cinematic Universe also can’t wait for this movie looks really good
Garbage from start to finish
SO COOL!!!!
Boom es lo que buscas?
Brons elite team writeup lookin stacked
Y’all see Drogon from Game of Thrones?!   Warner Bros should start their own universe and connect all their films, that would be epic!
tell me even more goofy name for a villain than *"The Goon Squad"*
Where’s Bill Murray?
Yes Sir!!!!!!! Been Waiting On This!
What the fuck is going on here
u gotta be kiddin -- granny's actually best man!! and the iron giant ...woah and that mystery van ..and was that kong?...and all that looney tunes character man it's like m back in my childhood ....feels nostalgic ..thnx WB gotta wait now for the **SPACE JAM**
Wow, this is all types of awesome, let's go! #GameOn
PENNYWISE ON THE RIGHT AT 1:46
Ok I will definitely gana watch
Okay this looks kinda dope. I was skeptical at first but this trailer made me a believer 😭
It looks epic i can't wait
This film is now going to be the most brilliant and crazy film
So War Machine is the main villain lol?
This looks like an even more soulless cash grab than the original Space Jam. By the looks of it, the Goon Squad won't be introduced until the game, so they'll certainly have less character than the Monstars did. Also, it seems lazy how they're integrating all the other IPs. If I'm going to watch a live action Looney Tunes movie, I'm going to stick with Looney Tunes: Back in Action. That one keeps with the spirit of the original cartoons much better than Space Jam did and what this one appears like it's going to. Hard pass.
#restorethesynderverse
1:46 PENNYWISE
why isn't daffy in a tune squad uniform
They didn't have to make the characters 3D. I am sad now.
I think the feeling I’m experiencing is... “happiness”
🏀🎶C’MON AND *SLAM,* WEL-COME BACK TO THE *JAM!!🎶🏀*
Looks fun, let's go, Bron!!!!!!!
I saw the yetis from Smallfoot which LeBron was a part of
Space Jam came out in 1996, so this is is the 25 year anniversary (Not quite) of Space Jam along with a new movie
I stand with Pepe. I stand with Speedy. #BoycottSpaceJam2 #ReleaseTheSpeedyPepeCut
This is fcken wawesome
Lezzzgo LeBron 👑
2:11 d-wade
Couldn't they have just kept it as the looney toons world? Why all the extra shit? Why?
What the...
WB: we need an ad disguised as a movie, better yet if we can cash in on the nostalgia. Writer: uuh...space jam but inside hbo max server? WB: genius!
Rhody? U here? (Tony's voice)
GOATED
2:10 THEY DID THE MEME!
Anyone notice before LeBron crashed into the force filed him and Lola bunny did the Dwane Wade LeBron Alley oop pic from Miami?
Michael Jordan did it better 😉🤷🏻‍♂️
CGI Lola Bunny look like shit
I SAW PENNYWISE
I love it!
I was actually pretty suprised by how much i liked this now we need the soundtrack to be on point as well please
The music here is definitely good......I'd like this complete track
Lola hit the D-WADE!!!
Thanks for triggering me by showing me game of thrones
*W E L C O M E* *T O* *T H E* *S P A C E  J A M* 🏀
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm getting some ready player one vibes on this.
I hope Lebron doesnt do a flop or break his achilles with this movie.🤣
I dont like how they gave him a fake family
That Will Smith joke💀
No Game no Life basketball
hotel? trivago. space? jam.
А почему на российском ролике отключены комменты???
Lebron is pro-China and anti-America. F' that guy!
Honestly, I wasn't expecting game of thrones to be in this😅
Cant wait for Erik Voss of NewRocksters to show me  the 10,457 details I missed in this trailer
Thats Not my lola
1:04 - 1:32 Oh, hand-drawn animation,  beautiful glorious hand-drawn animation, it’s SO good to have you back!!!
Space jam: Ready player one
LETS GOOO
Did someone notice penny-wise in the background at 1:45?
This sucks
This looks like absolute shit.
Bron still can't act lol
Why it always gotta be 3D animation
Really interesting, so many things to take in from this trailer can't wait for the movie to release
Legends are waiting for Ready Player Two
Umm uh yeah this isn’t gonna do good...
Now Lebron gotta assemble a dream team to beat the Nets lmao
2:23 clockwork orange lol
0:23 Lebron seeing his son vanish before his very eyes: "Dom 😐"
Lebron can truly act
SAM HAS HIS GUNS
👑👑👑👑👑👑
Remember when Endgame was the biggest crossover???
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Toonpur ka superhero
oh it's ready player 2
Anyone spotted pennyvise 😂
This looks like the ultimate acid trip movie
A special appearance from Jordan would have been dope!!
The way James travels through the planets is exactly the same as the beginning of Ready Player One and at the end of the trailer you can see Kong, Iron Giant, etc... like a teaser for Ready Player Two!
Ready Player One: Bugs Bunny edition
Ready play two looks as bad as I thought.
This feels incomplete without pepe
This is basically Ready Player One 2.
music is really bad!
The weirdest and the most unexpected collaboration ever  But i like it 🔥
I definitely cannot wait until July 16th...it can't come soon enough for me that was a damn awesome trailer but funny as hell too
wow,and kong is in this movie
If Big Chungus makes an appearance, my life will be complete
Michael Jordan better have some cameos

Pennywise 1:46
The Tunes are back in action.
another disaster for sure and completed messed
0:35 um...the GoT opening titles?  Also, what is hollywood's problem with just hand-drawn cartoons?
Trash, can't believe they did Lola like that
This is really alike ready player one
OH LET'S GOO
Yikes, this looks fucking terrible lmao no wonder they didn't reveal the trailer for so long
what in the matrix hell.... :O
Where's the nba players?? And ayeee the d wade lob!!!!
Wow 😱🤤😍
#Restoresnyderverse
King James Is In The House!
Wth? Pennywise at 1:46 🤣
Space jam is my all time favorite so I’m excited for this let’s get it!
Y didn’t they make Bronny or Bryce play the son 🤦🏾‍♂️
So Lebron was never injured
LeBron seems like he's going to be just as bad as an actor as MJ in the original... And I'm here for it lol
At 1:33 the giant X in the background if from planet X in "Duck Duodgers in the 24 1/2 Century" :0
R&B Comeback soundtrack please!?!? 🎵💯
2:11 they did LeBron and DWades ally oop
This is going to be a blast to watch! 🌟
*SENIOR DISCOUNT!* 🕺  LMFAO!! 😂
Sorry, but where's "Let's get ready to rumble" classic theme song? :(
LeBron will go into Warner Bros. world to restore the Snyder verse. #RestoreTheSnyderVerse
I'll skip this one
Old heads still stuck in the past, hating but this actually looks good and is for the newer generation. I'll take a ticket please oh and some Popcorn and Mountain Dew.
Seeing Iron Giant here surprised me. Nice to see other WB/Hanna-Barbera characters in here. I wonder if we'll see Space Ghost in this movie. On another note, LeBron's acting is fine and the animation is awesome as ever.
OMG it's a Tron: Legacy deal
Damn boi, this looks so sick
Hahahaha, they remade the famous LeBron and D-Wade dunk.  That's awesome.
Thought there would be a scene of him licking Xi Jinping's shoes.
Omg!!!! How many Star eggs  how many!!!!😭😭🤩😍😍🙌
BOOM! you looking for your son?
02:10 D-Wade no look 🔥
2:10 Lebron and Dwayne wade
This is insane! I don't know what they were smoking while making this story, but I want some!
Bron lowkey trolling himself on draftpicks lol
1:44 Imagine appearing in a basketball movie after facing off against a giant lizard.
And, so 90's kids be like "boom.. you lookin' for this"...
I can't wait to watch Space🌌🚀Jam 2: A New Legacy of Lebron James on HBO Max this July 2021, you got that?
Yo wtf
Oh God. They actually did canceled  lola.... thus gen z is awful
Imagine if Godzilla is going to be in this
This is something freaking Awesome 💥💥
The trailer looks dope!! Definitely interested in seeing the movie. One thing though,  they still aren’t in “space” so not sure how the title space jam still works lol.
Hopefully this movie does have some vibes of the first movie as a proper sequel.
Omg iron giant and King kong about to base, also rest of looney toons looks great top  quality and look the same, so lola a bit differ then promos then i seen expect also quality and vibe of so bump for the movie and super excited as also for the Dpa Jam video game in Xbox Xeries X I' m so excited to see the Looney Tunes and  ever y other cartoon character in the sequel going to rewatch Space Jam this afternoon.
This is great
This is the Ready Player One of 2021.
It'd be really cool if MJ were in the movie, hopefully there's at least a cameo, or a nod or something. Imagine MJ pulls up on Bron like Bill Murray pulled up in the first movie
LEGENDARY WOWWWW
Dababy would be screaming LETS GOOOOOOO
yo, there better be a big chungus  cameo appearance
Amazing 🐐🐐
So many easter eggs! (Pennywise, Game of Thrones, DC, Hanna Barbera, OZ, and everything Warner Bros)
Lola Bunny: Gets Redesign Rule 34: Fine, i‘ll do it myself then
Damn, War Machine definitely lost it when Tony died.  Also, anyone notice that Twister movie reference?
I’m glad they’re still using guns
I need Mortal Kombat in this movie.
It’s giving me ready player one vibes
Well after all these years we finally got a sequel everyone and this better be one jam of a film
Some Characters i noticed, A Clockwork Orange, Thundercats, Space Ghost, Jabberjaw, The Mask, 70's Robin, 80's Joker, Penguin and Mr. Freeze, Iron Giant, Kong, Matrix Agents, The New Pennywise, Scooby Doo cast, Galactic Falcons, Games of Thrones Characters, H.Barbera Characters, Mad Max Characters, Amazons.  Btw Lebron acts so baaaaaad  And for those who say this is like Ready Player One, well wtf u think? WB has the rights os every character seen in this movie and also R.P.O included characters from another Studios, so do not compare 'cause is silly
THIS MOVIE WILL BE AWESOME..... AND FUNNY
So we gonna see two king kongs in 1 year
You had me at The Iron Giant.
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
War machine drops lebron into the Multiverse
YOUR REASON FOR CANCELLING NEW GODS MOVIE IS TRASH
Pica 😜😃 não vejo a hora  amo todos esses desenhos
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
I was worried it was gonna be bad but ya know it doesnt look that bad I'm kinda excited for this i mean it will never top the first space jam but it could still end up good
Michael burnham what r u doing there
Not gonna lie seeing the D-Wade Lebron ally oop reference was kinda cool
Freedom to Pepe Le Pew!
ready player one much?
King James 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Senior Discount joke had me laughing
I want to hate on this movie so hard, but that was a solid trailer.
Let's shoot the ball😂❤️
YES I LOVE IT
This looks so fun!
This looks 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I do hope LeBron allows his son to do him self...
Wow, The Iron Giant is getting a lot of exposure these days, first Ready Player One now this
NBA REFRERENCES!! Just a reach tho lol..  Water guy..”splash bro”? Snake...KD? Lmao Fire guy...nba players “on fire”?? Spider lady...ball handling expert??? Bird guy ....kyle korver? Or someone from the hawks? :)))
I don’t understand why it took that long for a sequel. I really want to see MJ’s reaction to this. It looks amazing to see other cartoon characters like the Iron giant, yogi bear, the flintstones.
I was hoping for a random legendary actor to show up like Bill Murray in the 1st one. Or better still, just have Bill Murray show up.
Don’t compare this to Jordan’s. It’s a new approach and will be great. Lebron knows the expectations and will deliver. Remember it’s for the kids, not you social media Critics
No Monstars in it??? 😔
“Look how they massacred my boy.”
🤩WoooooW, I'm waiting for the Sapace Jam in Theater's 😍
War machine in the movie? MEPHISTO CONFIRMED.

Well atleast Kath Soucie is coming back to voice Lola Bunny, all we have to ask for now is to Release The Thicc Cut.
Lebron going for the dunk and Lola bunny going like Wade to recreate one of the most famous Lebron posters was a good moment
That scene with Kong, the Hanna-Barbera characters and so on is similar to Disney’s Wreck It Ralph 2 Oh My Disney scene in which they showed their properties and its very pleasing. Finally Warner Bros is acknowledging their full potential and I’m excited. Bring them on.
Finally!! A new trailer is here!!!  And I hope that ALL characters of Warner Bros. Studios from ALL movies and TV Shows, will be reunited, with all Cartoon Network characters, including Lord Black Hat from "Villainous"!!! And that must be a mutant birds, snake, and a elementals? And that must be the world of internet, just like pay a tribute to Disney's Wreck-It Ralph and Ralph Breaks the Internet? And did he say "SERVERVERSE"?  And so, a new chapter of the Space Jam saga is here, "Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021)", Coming to theaters and on HBO Max, July 16th, 2021!!  Now, let's get out there and win this game, doing the exercise and training!!!  Welcome to.......... THE SPACE JAM!!!

Why does the 2nd half of the trailer remind me of Ready Player One? I am starting to get the vibes from it.
ready player one sequel
Dayum
What if he went to the game of thrones world 😂
This is gonna be 🔥
This trailer has made me lose faith in the Animation industry.

Here before this goes trending
#restorethesnyderverse
Okay I’ll admit it. This looks good.
Big Chungus or riot
Yall better fix what Buggs Bunny’s GF look like, she giving major Sonic the hedgehog vibes before he was fixed. She looks like a squirrel not a bunny
why is kong here? is this where they sent him after losing to godzilla?
2:10 Lola doing her best DWade impression
Lola bunny is men que hiciste Warner
This looks like hot garbage
Holy shit🤩🤩
When director Malcom D. Lee (most notably scary movie 5 and night school)’s name shows up in the trailer: 🤦‍♂️  When producer Ryan Coogler (Creed I & II, Black Panther, Judas and the Black Messiah)’s name shows up in the trailer: 🙌
Better
Space jam song is iconic
This looks fantastic
if i saw this BEFORE ready player one i would be super hype about that iron giant and kong cameo. this looks ok tho. not nearly as good as the first but better than most loony tunes stuff since
Shaq would’ve been way more entertaining in this
1:46 the fact that pennywise is in a kids movie somehow excites me
This looks kinda....should I say.....Looney?
bro please please please please please please please please please please please    tamil tamil tamil tamil tamil tamil  dubbed do do do please bro
They need to stop with 3d
Superman: Bugs...on your left
Compared to the first movie, this movie is a HUGE upgrade in a good way. My mind is fucking blown with how good this looks
Is this related to Ready Player One? TELL ME IF THIS RELATED!
KONG IS IN SPACE JAM TOO?!
this is lookin like WBs version of Wreck it Ralph! can't wait
This why MJ is the GOAT.
it's like a ready player one 2
2:45 HOURS RUNTIME CONFIRMED BY DIRECTOR✌✌
...... Yes pls
Will Team RWBY be in this as well?!
They nerfed Lola
Capitalist media entertainment throwing up all over itself and it's just as beautiful as you thought it would be
Holy damn
0:35 Imagine if he went to the Game Of Thrones planet. 😂
Wow this looks waaay different and better than the first Space Jam movie.
Take my money 💵
Ready Basketball Player One
Whoa whoa whoa.... I didn’t know Dan Akroyd was in this picture!
I can't not laugh at Don Cheadle since he became a meme on twitter
This is weird af...but so was the first movie lol
Well, Lola looks good ❤️
So this is where Kong went after his match
Ok I'm excited
Another Iron Giant appearance!!! We need a live action remake😭🙏
This is weird
Not feeling it this ain’t no space jam
Kong gets another movie?
Warner Bros Cinematic Universe
Should have been Kyrie instead of 'Bron.
LeSpaceJam LeAwesome
Looks like fun. The fact that LeBron will be a toon in classic 2D instead of blending will mean we can see more wacky animated antics.
So what is this movie?
2:07 Jump Up to the top Le Brone~  1:18 King Kong, Kick the Drum, rolling on like a rolling stone~
This is gonna get a billion dollars probably but it really doesn’t look like it’s deserving of it especially on the story telling front
The sequel to Ready player one looks sick.
LEBRON JAMES + WAR MACHINE + THE MYSTERY MACHINE = ALL I NEED RN 😌
Sooo excited 😘✌️✌️✌️
War Marchine: **drops Lebron** *BOOM YOU LOOKIN FOR THIS*
The premis is super cool
LESGOOO
The cameos and call-outs in the group shots are impressive. At 2:07 you can see The Mask, classic Penguin, Danny Devito Penguin, Arnold in his bathrobe Mr. Freeze, and a monkey from the Wizard of Oz all underneath the Mystery Machine.
😍😍😍😍
They got the iron Giant AND king Kong? HELL YEAH!!!
Not gonna lie, that "What's up, doc" made me smile.
Should have been blake Griffin 🥱
1:39-1:46 I guess this film was originally going to be Ready Player Two.
Oh!!!! Double Toasted is gonna have a field day with this crazy shit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
Ok, let's check in which well-known peeps from WB are joining us in this ride: -Game Of Thrones -Wizard Of Oz -DC -Lord Of The Rings -Hanna Barbera -King Kong -Matrix -Mad Max: Fury Road  You give me some folks from the Cartoon Network world and Harry Potter, and I'll be there opening day. And more badass moments with Granny please, she stole the trailer 😂😂
Welp Lebron ain't great.
never thought ready player one goes basketball mode
Epic
It looks ridiculous. I love it!!!!!!!
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Who else got Ready Player One vibes 🙌
This looks ridiculous, cheesy as hell, and off the wall nuts....  AND IT LOOKS LIKE A TOTAL BLAST!!!
This Trailer is THE DEFINITION of Hype
Get ready to Jam🏀!
https://youtube.com/channel/UCCRamAKTNBQKPO35hxuQUtg
really excited for this! HELLO AGAIN CHILDHOOD!
More like ready player 2
Looney tunes Returns 💗☺️👍
NO WAY!!!!! I can’t wait to watch this movie!!!!!
This is like Ready player one all over again because everybody is in this movie.
😮🏀I taw I taw  a Hanna-Barbara characters
1:18 "You Forgot to mention my name. Pal." - Godzilla, 2021
Yea I’ll be seeing this
IDK HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS ONE...
So i'm guessing leBron James will be advertising this in China?
Yes.... this is actually a movie
What the matrix,this is the first film I am seeing in 2021 in cinemas
WTF?????
1:18 That’s a legendary draft list
Knock off of ready player one lmao
Just me who is geting some ready player one vibes
I suspect the same level of corniness, but that was such in the last space jam so this should be just as fun.
the most Bron-Wade iconic alley oop!
Ready Player One vibes.
So instead of the cartoons living in their own a little world deep underground like in the first movie, they're all living in a digital universe?
Definitely Jeff Bergman Is Voicing Bugs And Daffy!!!!! YES!
Meh
Granny got skills!
Tom &Jerry and Looney tunes my favorite 😍😍😍😍😍 Childhood memories ❤️❤️❤️
feels more like ready player one with other non looney tunes characters  but still excited AF
So Pepe isn't in this movie but Bugs is? He's a r@p!$t.
I don’t know I’m gonna have to see the whole film to get my full opinion I guess we’ll wait and see come July 16😊😊😊😊👍👍👍👍✌️✌️👍👍😊😊😊😊🤬
Kong is in the Movie
Furries were complaining about Lola.... But honestly.... I think this proves them wrong.
Gonna be a lot of cameos in this I believe 👀
I dont think im ok with looney tunes being in cgi
DAFFY DUCK IS MEPHISTO!!!!
I'm in
Is this the trailer or full movie
2:07 The MASK , next to Agent Smith, and The Penguin :D
I’m interested.
#restorethesnyderverse
I didnt really have high expectations for this, but it doesn't really look that bad
Why do they keep cameo-ing the iron giant in movies but not give us an iron giant sequel (or remak)!? lol! This looks fun, though!
2:07 Jump Up to the top Le Brone~  1:18 King Kong, Kick the Drum, rolling on like a rolling stone~
Sam shooting the ball with guns still better be in the final cut of the movie. Don't take it out.
"This is the snyderverse... uh I mean the serververse!"
welcome to the space
The Smash Bros. of movies.
Nostalgia ❤️ I wonder if today's even know the loony toons
Kinda bummed that they didn't bring back the Monstars.
Best Trailer Ever On YouTube. It is fantastic, fabulous, amazing. #SpaceJamNewLagecy
1:46 is that IT far right?
Scott Pilgrim's Ready Player one looks so good 😍
Ist crazy dude
*Boom are you looking for this*
1:40 Was that Drogon from game of thrones alongside the Iron giant?
Looks like War Machine monitors Multiverse.
So it's Space Jam 2 and Ready Player 2?
Ready Player One: Basketball DLC
I'm kinda disappointed with the 2D animation. The 3D designs all look pretty good. But I was really holding out for the 2D animation to feel like a throwback to that 90s movie with its smooth and bouncy animation style. But this just isn't that. I guess I set my bar a little too high, perhaps. Oh well. Still excited to see the movie when it releases.
1:46 I SEE THE ANIMANIACS! WE WON #ZANYTWT!
Please tell me they're facing the Nets, they're basically Monstars now lol
My favorite thing out of this whole trailer is the classic theme song, huge W
Ayo was that drogon and Kong in the same movie?? Warner bros really bragging their ips at this point
Feeling cool
Oh my goodness
Lbj my GOAT
Sam, shoot the ball 🤣🤣
Well. This isn’t for me I guess. But you guys enjoy.
Cant wait for Skips reaction
I bet Michael Jordan is making a cameo
❤️🌌💫🌪️
1 Minute Silence for those who didn't even watched 1st movie...& 2 is already here
2:10 Lola Bunny😍😍😍.
2:10 D Wade reference
The 2D animation for the upcoming Space Jam sequel looks pretty and highly detailed!
It looks like ready player 2 but more 3d.
Now I know I said why now, but I do acknowledge there have been attempts(Back in action) and that looney tunes shouldn't have to rely on a basketball novelty to stay relevent
I'm not gonna lie I approached this with a pretty low bar but now I'm really excited! Can't believe I was baited into thinking it'd be FULL cartoon for a second. 😂
It's time to slam now.
This is CRAZYY!!!!🤘😛🤩🤩
Bronny didn't make the cut
Who did you spot in the crowd?
Why didn’t they just cast his real life son?
Garbage. Please Don't destroy our childhood. This was a classic and now It's an embarrasement.
cool but #RestoreTheSnyderCut my HBO MAX account is gonna expired soon and I know how to use the internet, so I dont need an hbo max.
1:41 They added characters from classic Cartoon Network and characters from Warner Bros 😲😲😲😲😲 THIS ABOTTA BE LIT 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Wait wait. Is this space or virtual reality?
Amazing
It's the crossover of wornerbros franchise

So i guess Godzilla vs Kong postcredit scene was Kong jumping into this universe to watch basketball lol. Hypeeeee
Reminds me of Ready Player One a bit with all the extra characters not strictly looney tunes
JORDAN = 🐐 But Lebron is good movie looks like fun. Original Space Jam was my Jam though
#RestoreTheSnyderverse
Cool!
Getting Ready Player One vibes
fingers crossed that the didn't mess it up :) the first one is just too good
another verse!!
That Lola "Wade" Lebron moment was hilarious
I want a Harry Potter cameo, along with cameos of the DC heroes, Middle-Earth characters, and Godzilla.
Alright, #SpaceJamANewLegacy  looks insane, I can't wait! #SpaceJam  #SpaceJam2
I like how they didn’t try and follow the second one this concept is fresh and cool
The “shoot the ball” joke caught me off guard, that was perfect.  Plus that 2D animation is GODLY, I expected it to be a lot cheaper than it looks here so color me surprised!
Was not expecting a crossover from other WB stuff Oo
That feeling when you saw this in front of Godzilla vs. Kong yesterday....
2:10 lola with the dwade LOL
Here before the 1 million views! 🏀☄️
Don’t mind me am just here to comment
I love don cheadle
Where's penelope pussycat
The reason Godzilla attacked Kong is because he didn't get an invitation to the Space Jam tournament.
Space Jam meets Ready Player One
Bring back bill murray to help. " whoa ho ho, i dont play defense " lol
almost first
1:44 is that monster verse kong
0:35 Game of Thrones!!
мега кринж
They should turn Space Jam: A New Legacy Movie into a Video Game.
UFFF THE BEST KIMG JAMES 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
Woah they actually animated him??? Nice!
This looks good.
Ready Player One Vibes
It looks alright the animation is rlly good and the cameos r cool too
Los animadores de classico space jam estaria decepcionado por esta versión usar animación 3D Que cuesta hacer 2D igual q la mierda de la película de tom & Jerry
I never watched Jordan play but my dad was one of his biggest fan girl and I can’t lie he’s the goat and watched all his highlights and the first space jam but this man is my goat of this generation and seeing this is tears to my eyes 😭
I didn't expect the trailer to be this good, Ik some people will be upset with Lola and that's understandable because she was extremely athletic in Space Jam while in here she looks like a relative of Bugs Bunny 😂  Other than that, I can't wait to see what all happens in this movie... LEBRON TURNS INTO A CARTOON AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT'LL BE A 2D FILM FOR MAJORITY OF THE FILM WHICH IS AWESOME!!!
Looks epic!!
but what about penelope pussycat in tune squad?! in xbox promo contest of Space Jam: A New Legacy, she'll be in tune squad in this movie.
Will this be released in RealD 3D?
Monke in space Jam
I don't care about the complaints about Lola bunny. This Trailer looks awesome ! ❤ Looking forward for the Movie release
READY PLAYER 1 sequel?

Why the fuck does it actually look super fucking good
Oh myyyyy Gggooood ! Hype is here ! Can't to wait to watch this movie !!! Seems to be crazy
So basically the Warner bros version of Ralph breaks the internet? Trash. Lebron will never eclipse MJ in any aspect
Hell it was about time!!! Hype-train 🚆🚉🚄🚋
1:46 BABY JANE 😱
I already know the original is still better
Senior Discount Ahahahahah!!
I was sceptical, but man does this look great. Can't wait to see it
LeBrons acting is awful. Lost another one to MJ. Those new jerseys are 🔥 🔥 🔥 though
LETS GOOOOOO. WHO IS EARLY???
Ahh seeing the animated characters again is just precious...
This looks great!! My nephew and my niece would love this! All the kids will love this!
This turned from Looney Tunes to Ready Player One so fast
I'm in
Space Jam? Strawberry galactic!
Iron giant only had one movie but with this one he will be in a total of three movies (He was in ready player one too)
Looks Amazing
Just looks like overproduced, CGI laden, garbage. This does not look like it's going to hold up to the original.
2:03 Whatever it takes
I still wanted Pepe le Pew on this.
oh FUCK
THE JORDAN ONE WAS THE BEST...THIS LOOKS SHIT...THEY WASTE MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE AND NOT ON ZACK SYNDER'S SEQUELS!!!
#henrycavillsuperman
That Granny is awesome in trailer
It feels like ready player 1 but with a ball instead of a vr
This is the type of movie we all were waiting for!!
The epic monke withdrew from his kingdom in the Hollow Earth for a while to see this epic thing.
Yessir Everyone check in if you’re here on 4/3/21
Gay
This Looks Awesome 🤩
#henrycavillsoursuperman
The animation WTF ITS SO SMOOTH
Uh... eh... this looks... incredible. I literally can't speak.
#restorethesnyderverse
LeFraud is actually 0-74 in the Finals 46-83: Too lazy to even be born 84-03: Too lazy to even show up 03-05: Missed playoffs 06-11: Lost 12: Baby Thunder 13: Ray Allen 14/15: Lost 16: Injured Warriors 17/18: Lost 19: Missed playoffs 20: Mickey Mouse Summer League Ring
Glad to see they let Yosemite Sam keep his revolvers. Lol.
#releasetheayercut
So this is how its gonna be. Every two decades we’ll get a new Space Jam lol
Haha this will be masterpiece! TEAM GRANNY 😂😂😂❤
looks so funny
So many Easter Egg and reference tied to Warner Bros
Can’t Wait.
Unbelievable! and so much for Pepe le Pew for not being in this upcoming surprise movie of the year!
Kong ?! What are you doing here me boi ?
0:43 KING CHEADLE!?!
Okay Ready Player One
Uhhhh... No Mon Stars?
No teen titans go, no tom and Jerry, no mad, no banana splits, no the lego movie, no thundercats in the trailer?
Lola Bunny adding the eye wink and posture, like dwyane wade posture after LBJ  classic dunk
#restorethesnyderverse
They did the epic Wade to Bron Picture! 🤣🙌🏻
Cartoons being potential slaves by tiny aliens was bad enough, way to take a leap and base your kids movie off kidnapping a human child, by someone clearly more powerful than the child's parents.
this looks pretty cool
"Eeeeeh , What's up Doc?" 😂❤
Dem all those cameo from old series   Feels young now
This looks disgustingly bad and if you're excited about this you need to spend less time consuming mass media.
#restoretheSnyderVerse 💥💥💥💥
This looks... Good..
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
Looks great, now WB can we please get a live action The Iron Giant movie please? He’s done enough cameos!
#PutTheTinyToonsandAnimaniacsinSJ2
1:41     J U M A N J I opps wrong movie
This trailer looks so fun!!!!!! So excited
Where's pepe?
Todas las referencias de esta película 🤯
Thank you Warner Bros. <3
Estragaram a Lola
Yoooooo this is mint!
The CGI, 2D Animation and VFX look amazing. This film is gong to be epic. 😁🔥🔥🔥
Nar ain’t feeling this at all, thought it would be class after the first space jam but ohhh man
Ready Player One came out only 3 years ago and they're already remaking it?
#henrycavillsuperman
SpaceJam cultists are to blame!
Looks bad. I’ll stick with the original
#henrycavillsoursuperman
#RestoreTheSnyderverse
Fuck no
i'll watch it for 2 reasons: I love the looney tunes and i love the wbs cameos
Wtf is this
Not bad           Yet
‪This movie doesn’t take place in space.‬
Look at Lebron man so inspirational
#releasetheayercut
This is just Ready Player One, but with basketball
Looks like trash, better off using that money to produce the Synder Verse Warner Brothers
So canonically, the Monsterverse ends with Kong watching Lebron and the Looney Tunes play a game of basketball.
This looks just as ridiculous as it needs to be.
Y los villanos
This is racism, some blacks, there are no white actors and Asians. That's the real racism. Boycott of creators
THIS LOOKS...    ...idiotic...
The amount of basketball memes that will come from this movie will be insane
Guys I think I might be crazy but in some scenes I see black blobs with white circles near the Water Tower and I think It might be the Animaniacs. There is also one scene in the audience where I think I see Dr Sratchnsniff's head on the right side.
#restorethesnyderverse
All right, this trailer looks REALLY AMAZING! 🔥
Amazing but no new concept......
LeBron James was in Smallfoot.
The way I’m out of breath from hyperventilating after seeing this.
So they're going 3D now? I guess I can see why they 'nerfed' Lola for this movie.
Fucking warnbrosindia because u didn't dub it in telugu
I can't believe this is real. Wow just wow.
I love it
Let's Go Sqaud!
1:03 has anyone noticed that the dust LeBron made is shaped like a ball falling on a hoop?.....I'm gonna love this movie.
Let's just hope they can keep the funny and not screw it up cus of cancel culture
They say it's a sequel to Space Jam but for a bit it REALLY looked like a sequel to Ready Player One XD
WELCOME TO THE SPACE JAM
Bryce be like you have another son 🤣🤣🤣
Looks good but please lets bring back Pepe Le Pew! He did nothing wrong!
Rhodes Is in New Legacy?! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
You show Iron Giant in your movie and you will always have my money!
Hindi Dubb Please.
Is it me or I thought I saw Drogon
So many old cartoons ‼️‼️😭🙏
Space Jam trailer finally drops  Ready Player One : (snif) I'm proud of you son !
Not my lola bunny
Ready player one but it’s basketball
"Boom! You lookin for your son!?" -don cheadle
Way back then mj and looney tunes are two of the biggest shits in the world. Right its only lebron. Kids nowadays dont gaf about looney tunes
It's interesting that this movie went the extra mile to do both 2D and CGI for the beloved Loony Toons🐰🦆🐷.
The Lola bunny D-Wade move sold me
Ready Player Two already by Looney Tunes.. I'm in
I hope the monstars come in and help
MORE LIKE INTERNET JAM
Oh Hell Yeah!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥 I have waited so long for this. Let’s go Lebron, and let’s go space jam 2!!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥
Wow this looks real shit.
Yo, this just came out 20 mins ago, why are the comments 20 hours ago?
Under 100k Gang ⁉️‼️
They need to fix Lola bunny man.
The tunes are back in town
Ready player one: basketball
Where is Moron Mt? “Don’t bring me here anymore, alright” Lmao
Everyone out here freakinh out that the space jam is back...       I'm just thinking about superman, Gandalf, iron giant and monke playing basketball.
Here we go 🤗🔥
LeBron James??....this is gonna be good
Ностальгия...
Woke Jam
#restorethesnyderverse
GOAT
Oh, boy. I can really see this film going in two different ways. It can be really good and a ton of fun, or it can end up being just plain bad. No middle ground. And the crossover aspect is interesting, but I really hope it isn't distracting and the film can find a good ground for them, although I do always have a good time finding the cameos and easter eggs. Overall, I do think there is a lot of potential to be found, but I hope that it ends up being a good film on it's own. And that's coming from someone who never saw the first Space Jam.
The Hanna-Babera cameos is testing out how a Hanna-Barbera Cinematic Universe would work out since SCOOB!
Tutubarão ali bixo!! 1:43
OH MY GOD!!!😱😱😱
Movie of the year no doubt 🐇🏀
I am crying, what have they done to the Tunes!?! WHY DID THEY DO 3-D!?! I WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE WITH THEY CARTOON APPEARANCES AT LEAST BUT THEY LOOK NIGHTMARISH NOW!!!
*WELCOME TO THE SPACE JAM* Time for new blood, can't wait 💯
I’m way too early
I'm so glad they added some 2D Animation in this and then they add 3d animation in it this is badass and I can't wait for this film
Increíble está mejor de lo me imaginaba wow ya quiero que sea Julio
Trash
I thought Eric Bauza was going to voice Bugs and Daffy but Jeff Bergman’s Version is also good better than Gerg Burson’s Version
So kong is playing Basketball after whooping MeghaGodzilla.
What is it with Warner Bros and putting Iron Giant in shit?
This actually looks amazing...
Posso dire che si poteva fare a meno di girare questa porcheria pacchian-americana?!? Così eh...
Soo happy
Don Cheadle be like: "Boom!! You looking for this?" 😆
Come on and slam and welcome to the jam
this shit bussin
Amazing animation, excellent visual effects, stunning live action acting, and outstanding Cartoon Network cameos! Warner Bros. and Warner Animation Group, you really outdid yourselves to make this sequel of Space Jam for us. I just want to say thank you for making this happen. I really appreciate all the hard work on this awesome sequel. I hope you guys make more of these Cartoon Network Movies, like Tom & Jerry for example. Thanks again for doing this for us.
Don Cheadle be like: "Boom!! You looking for this?" 😆
Looks a lot more promising than the new Tom and jerry
I just realized this, the full animated world looks like the animated world in the “Fat Albert movie” World!!
This is going to be fun!!!😁
Whow The Original Looney Toons Return
Can't believe their Bringing back The Iron Giant, Again! XD
Why lebron hairline look like cgi?
Why do all of these hype comments seem fake? Zero effort put into making them look realistic lol....
Marry the bunny!
KINGJAME FC FROM THAILAND
Just by these seconds we can already tell Bron acts better than MJ
I wasn’t expecting Kong to be in this 1:44
Damn, it’s shitty and it’s going straight to DVD.
I thought he was saying "This is Snyderverse" 😂😂
COOL😎
Meh 😑
It's about damn time...
1:42 Yogiiiiiiiiiii!!!!!!!!!
So many easter eggs!!! Can't time laps them all 😂😂
“Eh, *tick tick tick*, what’s up Lebron?”
2:11 Lola Bunny with the D Wade lob 👀🔥
Do you guys think this is going to be a classic or nah?
Ayo I wasn't really hyped for this but man I'm hyped af music gives me daft punk vibes....   Only downside is lola bunnys downgrade  design but it's just me and many others.     Also #restorethesnyderverse
U telling me that black ball thinggy isnt from Gantz ?
This is look good I like they put the Space Jam theme in the trailer 😃
They just re-used the 3D model of the Iron Giant from Ready Player One. You can tell because it also has pieces under construction.
First
Not gonna lie, it looks kinda stupid and kinda sick at the same time
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Better be a reference to the first one somewhere
LET'S GO But It comes out after my bday tho Still, i'm excited
Welcome to the Space Jam bug and the others this Movie Is going to be Awesome
Hand drawn animation
this looks bad
2:10 thats the money shot.
Looks so trash 😂
its ready player one Space jam Edition
Awesome 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☄️💫
SHE DID THE WADE
Looks,Kong is back!!!
This trailer just blew me up....
Thumbnail looked like Kong attacking Godzilla with its weapon
I’m definitely seeing this in theaters.
So it’s Ready Player One, but with cartoons?  Ehhhhhhhhhhh......
I didn't expect it to look THIS good!
There's always some kinda extreme grandma
Oh look its the Ready Player One sequel
Trailer 13 minutes ago Comments 13 hours ago  Wt..
Okay from what I'm seeing in this trailer I think somebody's been watching Ready Player one for quite some time
Alright time to check what people think about this trailer in the Comments section.  The comments :  #rEsToReThEsNyDeRVeRsE  Ok that's enough of reading comments today.
imagine king kong vs godzilla but as a basketball match
Needs more Bill Murray
my boy RL Grime making that cash with Scylla
It's Ready Player 1 all over again...
Bugs Bunny: Eh, what's up doc? Coach guy: I'M NOT A DOCTOR!
Welcome to the Space Jam!!!!
I'm not impressed the classic shits all over this but I'll still see it.
It don't looks good...
Uau
2:17 the mask!
WOHOHOHOOO DE ESO ESTABAMOS HABLANDO >:D
#restorethesnyderverse
Why do i feel that this is gonna be a Cash Grab?
After seeing Lola Bunny...  Me: Look how they massacred my girl  Nonetheless, this looks pretty sweet! The first one was a classic so here's to hoping that this would be even greater!
Kobe would be proud of this.
I can’t wait to see this movie!! 25 years in the making!! 🤙🤙🤙
The Godfather Part II The Empire Strikes Back Terminator 2: Judgment Day Space Jam: A New Legacy  Don't look at me, it's what the critics are saying.
If someone says this is trash I want all of the fans of this movie to throw them in the nearest trash can
To Warner Brothers                #RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Just rewatched the first movie last night, and holy hell this is quite a HUGE change, and I love it. Really caught me off guard seein King Kong, The Iron Giant, Flinstones, etc. Can’t wait🔥!
Yes!
Good for the new generation, I’m keeping mine with MJ though. Cant beat it.
''You never let me do what I wanna do.'' ''You never let me just do me.'' Man that hits hard
So basically its a kid movie with LeBron James in it. Sounds interesting
This actually looks pretty good
REFERENCE OVERLOAD!!! 1:38
This unironically looks great
[obligatory avengers crossover joke]
He chases after his kid into a cyber world where he meets a god version of Don Cheadle who then proceeds to tell him the only way to get his son back is win a game of basketball with the looney toons? What kinda bull shit is this? If anybody actually thinks this has any potential whatsoever every has another thing comin 😂 The OG storyline actually made fuckin sense. Lebron always stay being a budget Jordan 🤣
Well this is gonna be turrible lol.
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY THAT TRAILER WAS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WB focusing on more depth colour things. That's sooooo dope
Ok, this looks interesting. I like how LeBron becomes a cartoon when he enters the Looney Tunes world as it’s something new from the first film, and even though I’d prefer if they were 2D the whole time, the Looney Tunes translate decently into 3D. The only downside is I wish that classic Warner Bros. characters like the Joker or Pennywise were the opponents that the Tune Squad has to oppose, not a generic antagonizing team.
nice nice modern graphics but this looks a bit over done compared to the original movie
So we deff just saw the entire movie 😂
🔥
Ready Player One x Who Framed Roger Rabbit on acid
Basketball player vs war machines who will win
So this is where kong went when he got bored at hollow earth
Evil Don Cheadle? I am intrigued
This trailer was cool .... once I saw King Kong I said WEAK mad loud he better hope godzilla not on the other squad
#RestoreTheSnyderverse
If I don’t hear Dunkstein & Slamough I’m going to be very disappointed.
Bugs!
That "COME ON BABY RUN. SO SHOOT BABY SHOOT" WOOOO SO MUCH NOSTALGIA
What’s Up Doc🥕
I hope we see the fabled Chaos Dunk.
I ain't a bot.
I need Big Chungus on this. I NEED IT
This movie it going to be straight dracarys
😍😍😍😍
Looney Tunes 😍
Trailer is lit💥💥💥💥💥
LeBron is the greatest basketball player of all time. This will be great
Ready player one lonney tunes version
Yakko, Wakko, and Dot Warner!
YOOOOO
Has a WB Ralph Breaks the Internet vibe
Day one I'm there!
Ready Player Two : The Movie
Did someone splice in READY PLAYER ONE to this trailer?
I wish this could be A TV Show.
Hey WB how about #restorethesnyderverse
Thé best
They messed up with that game of thrones ring around the world. Should of been lord of the rings
This do look raw lol
One word - Dope 🤩
#RestoreTheSnyderverse
Nobody is talking about cartoon LeBron. This movie looks epic
WONDERFUL
This will be the biggest Crossover ever happened in a movie. So excited 🤓.
1:17 I need to assemble an elite team...  Which happens to be comprised solely of licensed Warner Bros characters!
#RestoreTheSnyderverse
1:25 I swear Sam did that intentionally, he'll take any excuse to use a gun after that ban.....
#RestoreTheSnyderverse
#RestoreTheSnyderverse
Sam, shoot the ball! [GUN SHOTS] Let’s try that again, shall we?
I can't wait for the 2 hour videos of "What movie reference you missed in the Space Jam 2 trailer"
This is awesome bro
#RestoreTheSnyderverse
Very excited! I kinda want Michael Jordan to pop up the way Bill Murray did in the first movie
*Too bad femminists removed Pepe Le Pew*
#RestoreTheSnyderverse
Everybody Gangsta till The Granny Shows her DUNK.
It looks amazing and better than the new Tom & Jerry, and it reminds me Ready Player One with all the reference cultures.
#RestoreTheSnyderverse
Looks too unrealistic for me
I'm torn on this one. I'm glad the Looney Tunes were hand-drawn... But then you made them CGI. The idea of all these IPs crossing over to defeat a great evil sounds exciting... But I've already seen Ready Player One, and this look like more of the same. As a 90's kid looking to relive my childhood, I'm always looking for something to help me relive my nostalgia... But as a cynical adult who actually knows how the world works, I refuse to give AT&T my money.
#RestoreTheSnyderverse
Ja ja Increíble
Seeing high quality 2d animation in a new film is..... *sniff* beautiful.
WoW 🤩 WWWWWWOOOOOOOOOWWWW Cool the soundtrack, the uniforms, the context, King LeBron !!!!!  This makes a Sequel 🏀 👑 🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌🏽🙌🏽

I did not have Lola bunny recreating the Dwayne wade alley oop on my 2021 bingo board
Space Jam My Ass! This is a giant Easter Egg movie like Ready Player One.
Restore the Snyder Verse
I'm sorry, did Kong just show up after his fight with Godzilla and Mechagodzilla?
1:42 is that drogon? wtf

It looks really not like the First One. I don't know if i like the new Optik. And LeBron James is not so sympatic for me like Michael Jordan was in the 90s
Let's Jam in Space for its new Legacy!
3c films where you at mennnn!!!
" Bet will smith ain't gotta deal with this "  lmao
That trailer looks awesome! Aarhus cast of movie characters. Can't wait for it!
Looney tunes  back
I can’t believe how much likes compared to dislikes on this crap
BOOM! You came here looking for this.
Yeah it's time to shoot🔥 Let's play some basketball🐰🏀🤾🏿
YUCK
And to think... this generation has gotten offended by a cartoon skunk so they removed him🤦🏻‍♂️
This movie is gonna be 🔥🔥🔥
Wow This looks that’s is gonna be so much fun😃
Awesome, it's been 25 years since 1996 that I was born in April and I can't wait to see this movie of the second film, Space Jam, A New Legacy for all Looney Tunes characters like Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, Sylvester the Cat and the others soon!
I Can't Wait to See This Amazing Movie!
1:52. Is that Jack Nicholson’s Joker watching the game in the background?? Lool
I saw the matrix and I clapped
where the f is dame?
After Godzilla vs. Kong, Space Jam the next Blockbuster of 2021 😍😍😍😍
War Machine is the king of the digital Warner Bros. Domain...      ...He better say, "Boom, you lookin' for this?", or I'm gonna lose it.
I'll be honest, I'm kinda disappointed! I thought it would be more of a follow on from the original!
This looks terrible. 😂😂
Man, that will be the most crossover in history the movies 🤣🏀, i want Keanu Reeves, just it's.
What's Space Jam?
Ayo this looks dope
Lola doing the D-Wade no look 🔥🔥🔥
Awesome trailer, I can’t wait to see it when it’s released
very cool
Don Cheadle
So happy Yosemite Sam has guns again.
Supperb 🔥🔥👍 Love from india ❤️
Thought it would be his sons
The 4 year old in me is PUMPED
Let's get it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Awesome
Killmonger AND War Machine? Lets Go!
2:10 Lola do a dwane wade iconic pose
❤❤❤💥🔥
What the....
Hoho, My mama will be happy watching this!
My boy Kong is here
Yo!!!!!
I think this is gonna be like ready player one ending fight
Wow
Ok but what if LeBron entered the Game of Thrones globe instead?
Ready Player Two?
Already looking sweet!
God the animation in this is🔥
Somehow all the magic is gone for me. It's not like the first one.
I hope LeBron sees this comment
Whooooo!!! Yeah! I'm so exuberantly hyped for this! Incredibly amazing!
It’s the famous dunk he had wit dwade for me
Lebron: "What in "The Matrix" hell?"  *Y'know? For kids!*
Spectacular! Can't wait to see Space Jam: A New Legacy on HBO Max!
Welcome to Ready Player Two
I hope this space jam can deliver the same hype as what the original movie gave us with michael jordan.
I'm missin Kobe n Gianna 💔
Space Jam +Ready Player One  oh hell yeah
1:26 hey I thought Yosemite Sam can't use his guns anymore.
This looks like fun!
It’s a bit upsetting that Pepe Le Pew, isn’t here in the movie, but I’m glad that the trailer is here
Your not allowed to kick the ball in basket ball
We have all become Critics...this is for the kids and it looks good damn. He's not Jordan WE GET IT., who cares?!
Daffy Duck is the G.O.A.T
I'm so excited to see this movie in theaters.
I’m sorry but this looks bad and good at the same time
This looks like so much fun!
This will be the best movie in 2021.
Welcome to Space Jammmm!!!!
This looks lit but... Don't forget #restorethesynderverse.
At least Lola still a bucket 🪣
The music is electrifying
Yayyy , It's out !!!!!!!
What is this avengers cartoon edition!? I love it!
*WOOO! SPACE JAM 2 IS LIT AS HELL, Y’ALL! I’M WATCHING THIS IN THEATERS OPENING DAY!*
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
I love it!!!!
why......why now .....why not then
I can't believe Lebron James wouldn't do his kid......
WTF was that?! Why does Hollywood always have to overdo it that much?! CGI barf without end
READY PLAYER ONE BUT BASKETBALL
Lebron can’t even do this better then Jordan
What I find very interesting here is that they're not just featuring the Looney Tunes, but a whole bunch of other Warner stuff (King Kong, GOT, Iron Giant, etc).  It's like if Space Jam and Ready Player One had a baby together!
Nice
What in The Matrix hell?
Boom...you looking for Rhodey..!!!
multitalented  lebron proud of you
Ready Player Two
Looks interesting.
I’m hyped for this!!
Anyone else respects James line up •Superman •Ganfalf •King Kong •Iron Giant
My god, Iron giant and Kong are joining...
Welcome to the OASIS.
#RestoreTheSnyderverse

Goon Squad vs Toon Squad 👁👄👁
🔥🔥🔥🔥
0:33 Futurama internet!
Now this, is a lot more promising to really good! And way better than the original Space Jam and the new Tom and Jerry Movie! Which I was that film could been like Space Jam:a new legacy. And the Space Jam remix theme is the bomb!
Scooby Doo, Iron Giant, Kong, Drogon, The Flintstones, Yogi Bear, Pennywise, and More!  Ready Player One had a Competition when it comes to Crossovers!
8 minutes after it came out👌
king kong drogon giant wtf lol
Dudeee the fact this has both 2D and 3D is the best thing ever
اكو عرب في الطيارة 👀👀👀👀

Na this ain't it , bring back the real goat MJ and the tune squad
YOOOOO LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Cool kong in space jam 2

Scooby-Doo!
Love it!!  Love it!!!
lebron what in the hell🙈
The acting is 10/10 IGN from Lebron ahaha
I'm already want space jam 2 After seeing this. This looks amazing 👏
Wow!
Kinda sad I missed the premiere
Bronny won’t be happy about this
Already the acting looks terrible 🤣
I never expected to see Game of Thrones in a kid's movie
The Warner Bros. cinematic universe is expanding!!!!
I gotta see this movie!
That Dwayne wade and lebron Easter egg tho
Yeah! This looks Amazing!
This looks good!!! I see they turned Klay, Dame, AD, Diana Turasi, and the others into their own characters! Dope!!!
When he said serververse I heard SNYDERVERSE. #ReleaseTheSnyderCut
Look at LeBron so inspirational
War Machine 😱😱
Granny got some skills
This is awesome
Damn son
Ain’t gonna lie, looks pretty good
Haven't seen this many Easter eggs (no pun intended) since "Ready Player One".
more like "Space Jam: Player One"
Question,.... Where I'm supposed to watch this, at Home in my little 55"? coron.. shh getting real
Look like fun
Jump to the top LeBron! 🐥🐥🐥🐥 that was amazing!
Girl bunny think she Wade huh😂
#restoretheSnyderverse
This game is crazy
So Looney Tunes is canon in Game of Thrones now?
Oh man this looks awful
What in the matrix hell XD
I can't believe it... for the second time since the Animaniacs reboot, the Hanna-Barbera gang and the Looney Tunes are going to be together in the same movie! I just have one thing to say: YABBA-DABBA-DOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
And yes, there are Dragons 😃
That animation though! 😍
Meh
Why is the Iron giant in this movie 😂
LeBron is a great actor,hope he wins a Oscar like Kobe did
Be careful of injuries bronny
1:23 Duffy: I know what you are looking for... a dream team Shows Lola Bunny: everyone liked that
Blockbuster !!!! Agerly waiting for it !!! 👌👌👌
wow 💙
What a intresting movie ❤️❤️❤️
No lo sé rick  xd
Nice. but still #RestoreTheSnyderverse
It's just weird seeing a cartoon and arcade like style. Vs the live action set combine with the cartoon esthetic. But it still looks great
Why...
this looks sooo sick
#SpaceJamMovie📺📺🎤🎶🎥🎬🖤!
Damn, we're here early.
I want this every year from now on
Spoiler, he chokes in the 4th quarter and bugs bunny hits the game winning shot.

#restorethesnyderverse
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE
It's insane...I LOVE ITTT

Anyone else thinking this movie is going to suck and is just a cash grab by Warner bros
cringe and bluepilled
Finally 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Super LeBron for life
Wait this is not just Looney Tunes? Yo, this will be epic!
*LLLLLLLLLLLLETS get ready to RUMMMMMMBLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEE*

Confío en Ryan cogleer, es un gran director
#restorethesnyderverse

AMAZING AND ONLY THE FIRST TRAILER
Love it! But #RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Don't you forget that Warner Bros canonically made Bugs Bunny as struggling rapist.
Cringe: The Movie
#restorethesnyderverse
Don Cheadle thank you
#restorethesnyderverse
This just looks fun as hell. I'm super excited for this!!!
I am looking forward to space jam a new legacy
The fact that they kept the 2D animation is great  Alongside the 3D
What Kong's been up too since he retired in Hollow Earth
Jordan > Lebron
#restorethesnyderverse
Tune squad 💪❤️
Damn, Lebron got recruited by War Machine
#restorethesnyderverse
Not gonna lie. Lola Bunny just looks so adorable!
This Is amazing
This looks so good and horrible at the same time
HOLY SHEETS THIS TRAILER WAS EPIC KONG IRON GIANT SCOOBY DOO YOGI BEAR FLINTSTONES ARE IN THIS I’M SOOO FLIPPING HYPED

It looks better then I thought it would be so I might go see it in theaters. If not in theaters then definitely on HBO Max.
They allow Yosemite Sam using gun in this movie but not the Looney Tunes Cartoon HBO Max? Don't tell me it's a deleted scene.
Hyped af
Bugs bunny :Whats up LeBron
#restorethesnyderverse

I thought Don Cheadle was War Machine not Jarvis
Wow!
King James!!!!
#restorethesnyderverse
Lebron wants to be MJ so bad he’s copying his movie, I had to
The plot should be about finding out what happened to Lola’s big naturals
Is Tom and Jerry and top cat will be in it
Ok...we Really need Kong, The world needs him more than ever.
That was a good trailer
lola still do be lookin like a snacc doe
Spacetacular!!! 😀👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🏀🐰 Happy Easter folks!!!
It could've been better tbh, but it's just a trailer, and trailers don't always do the justice to the movie so the hope of it being good continues

I’m so excited I don’t how patient I can be
Guys, have you noticed that the WB doesn't want to know about the fans?  Have you noticed that there is only 1 and 2 months left for the Angelina Jolie film and The Conjuring 3 and not even a teaser poster?  Now I understand the frustration of Zack Snyder fans, they just want to know about their interests and what gives them money, while the rest are literally shitting ... Anyway, it is sad to see a studio with their size and quality that  have to lose all the credibility it has ... And the argument "we are in a Pandemic and we have to save our money", well, that is no longer valid in the face of what you have done (value one more X of films, and shit  in the others just because they have a greater popularity, and there would have to be a consensus and balance) ... Anyway, they were the disappointment of the year ... 👏
I am so looking forward to this 25 years ago is this film came out and I am ready for this sequel Obviously no Michael Jordan in the film but I'm giving the LeBron a chance  And from all the promotion recently I guarantee it's gonna be awesome!!!!!!!!!!
#restorethesnyderverse
Cant wait.
I was here before trailer 1 released!😄👍🏻
hopefully a lot of epic awesomeness in crossover and an Oscar potential worthy in terms of visual effects plus great improvement from either SCOOB or even Tom and Jerry, even improving from the previous looney tunes movies. Not to mention the revival of more 2d animation elements since Enchanted and mary poppins returns

My brother watched space jam since he was a kid.
Welcome to the space Jam!!  I'm so excited! :)
Me and my dad are going to watch this at the theaters beacuse my dad watched the first one when he was young about my age and a few weeks ago i heard about this movie called space jam and i asked about my dad does he know anything about it and he said "well i havent seen it since your age so i do know about it but cant rember much" so me and him bought the movie and watched it at home and we both loved it so when we heard about a second one were so damm excited Cant wait for this movie!!! ❤❤❤❤
Damm. Not gonna lie, I haven't been this excited for a movie trailer in a long, long time.
This is gonna be epic I can't wait to see all those cartoon  Characters that are owned by Warnermedia
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh s*************
LET'S JAMM

I can feel the "#RestoreTheSnyderverse" mfs coming
I Ready For See This!!!!!!
Finally, my fellow space jam fans, a famous basketball player is gonna play the ultimate basketball game in a world where no player has ever gone before. The digital world. CYBERSPACE!

Lola time
OMG I CAN’T WAIT FOR THE MOVIE
Warner Bro #Restorethesnyderverse
I can’t wait to do the Space Jam again tomorrow!
QUE EMOCION AAA
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse 💥💥💥
New jersey doesn't look as cool as the original jersey. Prince James is a poor substitute for MJ. Instead of doing Basketball again, they should've just had The Toon Squad team up with a different sports icon like for example Tom Brady or Cristiano Ronaldo or maybe even a dream team of Olympic champions like Usian Bolt, Michael Phelps & Simone Biles instead of repeating the plot of the first movie. This sequel ain't gonna live up to the classic original Space Jam.
I’m ready to jam

The soundtrack better be good, because Seal's Fly Like An Eagle, DJ Quad City's Space Jam and 2 Unlimited's Get Ready set the bar high for the music.
Let the Jam Begin!

Give us The Conjuring 3 trailer please 😢😢😢
Plz don’t be like coming 2 america
Lmao I saw this trailer in the theater while seeing Godzilla Vs Kong today
Привет я из России, мне нравится Looney Tunes👍😀🦆🐰🥕🐷😀👍🏀🏀🏀
Ahh  want up doc
I have zero interest in seeing this film, largely because I have ZERO respect for LeBron. He claims to care about racial justice but then supports the government of China were they are currently committing a genocide against a minority PLUS LeBron has made several anti-Semitic remarks, none of which he's been punished for or apologized for. Plus, he's just an arrogant jerk.
WOO HOO IM SO EXITED also this day on my side is April/02/2O21
Let's Get Ready To Rumble! 🏀
I feel long time to see this movie and this is going to be better than Marvel movies.
My favorite movie is coming and I can’t wait to watch the trailer for tomorrow morning.
Today while I was about to watch Godzilla vs kong for that I just saw a preview of this movie already it's like it's surprised me all the sudden and I thought they won't show that and rated PG-13 films unless one of them would consider Warner Bros. Saw the preview and I saw LeBron James and algorithm all I remember was there were two alternate appearance scenes one LeBron James turn into a 2d animation something that Jordan never had before and I'm impressed later bugs in his Looney tune gang become CGI effects just like one of those other animated movies that evolved into one. And then I saw some other properties of warner brothers, I just saw Kong, iron Giant and that mystery Inc machine . Didn't pay attention to the rest cuz I was a bit too resistant like I'm still clearing my mind but then later I saw some new characters I never experienced before they look like new opponents unlike the monstars. Whatever team it is they look very unnatural.
I guess I'll be jamming out in space.
HELL NO!!!!!
Everybody get up it's time to slam now  We got a real jam goin' down  Welcome to the Space Jam
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
OMG im excited guys i Love you Warner bros
I hope Jordan in it
I need PB&J
Eh. (Chomps on carrot) What’s up, guys? So excited to see my fav Tunes back in Space Jam 2! Especially Lola. Super fresh 3D Lola...😘😉😎
why do all these trailers premiere at 1am for me...
Looking like a double wide surprise
Come on and slam and come to the jam!
lola better be hot
I'm going to watch it with my dad
Welcome to the space jam🐰🥕
I’m so ready to watch the real GOAT LeBron James kick ass and collect checks in Space Jam: A New Legacy just like he does in the NBA today 🐐 👑🔥🔥🔥
I hope there are those of Cartoon Network
Anyone else already see the trailer before Godzilla vs Kong in theaters?
#RestoreTheSnyderverse
Yaaaaaaaas
Awsome
Welcome back to the space Jam
#restorethesnyderverse 😎
If you go to theaters early for kong vs Godzilla it shows this trailer
OMG
Looneytwt, if you are here...i love you all 😩💖
Space Jam 2 yesyeysyes
omgomgogmogmgomg
I still going perform classic space jam but I still give the second space jam a try
The trailer is pretty good. Can't wait to see the film!
Oh my gosh:Since 1996 after 25 years were we're waiting to watch a new fresh,fabulous,fantastic movie of basketball and their favorite characters the looney tunes. I had to tells us this. I hope this movie it's gotta be 100% real,fantastic not fake. I just can't wait to the trailer. I need to find my money and buy maybe the ticket in theaters. In fact it's been 25 years since the first came out in November but this one it's gonna and gotta be cool. I know because it's true It's not lie
Imagine Space Jam but with Nintendo characters instead of WB
original space jam with michael jordan is better to be honest
Sonic the hedgehog is awesome so as space jam 2
Let the games begin.
yea like it worked for Tom and Jerry movie, a pointless remake starring a commie sellout is going to make it any better  How about #restorethesnyderverse
Yes a new Space Jam movie! IM SO PUMPED FOR THE TRAILER!!
Waiting
Soy el único que habla español jajaja
This is a nice birthday gift
So excited!!!!
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Everybody get up, it's time for slam now
They should bring back Loonatics Unleashed with a 3rd Season or a reboot Loonatics Unleashed (but not like Teen Titans Go and Ben 10 2016)
This is going to be interesting
Well, I wonder what it will be like this time: even trapped into virtual space.
I can't wait!
Yay
I wonder what other characters are going to be in the film outside of loony tunes characters
Welcome to the jam!
I haven’t seen a cartoon hybrid movie with this much variety since who framed roger rabbit
COME ON AND SLAM AND WELCOME TO THE JAM!
I hope it’s good because while I liked Tom and Jerry it isnt having many good reviews and on meta critic it got a poor 33
Yea yea let's see this.
I've been waiting for this for so freaking long !!!
The drool, the wait, ITS OVER. This is their first jam in theaters since 2012. Since they had shorts play before movies like Happy Feet 2 and Journey 2 The Mysterious Island.
​I Can't Wait To see those Hanna-Barbera Characters!
I bet this will be everyone's favourite film of the year
This is about to be the blockbuster we all been waiting for.
#SPACEJAM2
hoping that Michael Jordan faced a cameo in this one it would be crazy
#RestoreTheSnyderverse #ReleaseTheAyerCut
How about you drop Those Who Wish Me Dead trailer.  Thanks.
Here we go, I AM HYPED!!! Also, why did we get the suicide squad trailer before this one? I love DC and Suicide Squad but this one releases first.
I'm not intrigued by the use of basketball in this film. What I am intrigued by is the fact that it takes place in a virtual world. My inner crossover loving geek is having an aneurysm, a seizure and possibly a stroke in all the best ways possible! Just hearing about the fact that we'll see so many characters in one spot is brilliant!   Anyway, back to the concept. I'm curious to see what this world looks like. I think I might draw inspiration when I watch it.
Every character confirmed for space jam 2 The Looney Tunes  and LeBron Scooby and Shaggy Blue Falcon Dynomutt  Penelope Pitstop Fred flintstone and Dino Jabberjaw Space Ghost  Yogi Bear The Jetsons  Captain Caveman King Kong The Mask/Stanley ipkiss  The wicked witch of the west Pennywise  Joker  Batman Robin Superman Wonder Woman  Penguin Cat woman  The Teen Titans Mad Max Harry Potter  Lord Voldemort Neo Frankenstein Jr Magilla Gorilla Peter Potamus and So so The Iron Giant Gandalf  Drogon Migo (From Smallfoot) Meechee (SmallFoot) Gwangi (SmallFoot) Winged Monkey The Thundercats Yakko Wakko Dot Mr Freeze Night Kings (Game Of Thrones) Clockwork Orange The nun Marty Mcfly Jason vhoorhees   Mama Fratelli (The Goonies) The War Boys (Mad Max 2) King Leonidas (300) Big Chungus  Dorothy (Wizard of Oz) Mutely Stripe  And The Gremlins

#restore the Snyder verse
Finally I been waiting for this a long time.
It's great to see the Looney Toons back in action. Bugs and Daffy are going to stur things up for sure. Then seeing Lola Bunny, Porky Pig, Foghorn leghorn, Sylvester and Tweety joining the chaos will be awesome in Space Jam 2: A New Legacy.
Lola Bunny!!!! 🐰🐰🏀🐰🐰🐰🐰🐰🏀🐰🐰🐰🐰🏀🐰🐰🐰🏀🐰🐰🐰🏀🐰🐰🐰🐰🏀🐰🐰🐰🐰
I’m definitely hoping this movie doesn’t suck because Warner bros movies from the start of scoob didn’t start good  then when tom and Jerry came out it wasn’t good either so please make this a good movie just please
Why walter hemada cancel new gods and the trench...
Please #restorethesnyderverse...........

Oh wow they was being for real 😂 ngl i thought it was a fools joke
Im so excited for this trailer!
Hello Warner Bros. I wanna email you and tell you about how you can get away with offensive media easily. It seems there have been lots of problems getting things age-appropriate or getting things to be not at all offensive. I personally want you to understand that the way you made your movies back then were not bad in any way. The way you should understand if something is wrong or unacceptable is by hearing the thoughts from the target audience that relates to it. This is a situation a lot of companies are dealing with and I want you to be the one to share it with more people because I think that these companies deserve to get away with much more stuff than wanted. It's easy not to get in trouble, all you have to do is find the right person to see it and if the target demographic is offended or horribly influenced, that's when you can know to stop. I wanna tell you this because you are my favorite company ever and the best way for you to avoid having to restrict so much is simple and easy. It’s simple to find the people who are meant to watch, play, or see the thing and let them decide if it’s offensive or not. In conclusion, the thing I want you and other companies to understand is that as long as the target audience is offended or horribly influenced, there is no reason for censoring. From one of your best fans: Jack Rodak. (Alright now can someone please help me get this to be read by an executive or something)
I love Lola! I hope they make her awesome like Sunset Shimmer!😍☀️❤️
Oh God no don't ruin the classic
The Narrator:“Welcome to the Space Jam”   Me:OMG,I’m so exited is gonna be funny,hilarious and cool
