Fun fact. The Russian-speaking millionaire YouTube channel "Cut the crap" earned a lot of views simply by plagiarizing this video, as well as many other videos from other channels
I'm from the future, and oof... you got a LOT of guesses wrong... Just to let you know. But the movie will be great!
I watch these after i see the movies and its crazy how spot on he is with his some of his predictions!
I think this is to prevent Thanos brother from reviving Thanos if that's the case the flesh their running across is the body of the decapitated celestial
Drax is dying I assume.  Didn't Bautista want out of the Marvel movies???
I think thor might bd in this movie
oh no they are gonna kill Rocket and if that happence i will cry cos this is my fav movie
Gamora is gonna die again.
That statue doesn’t look like the Statue of Liberty because it looks like it’s standing completely different
you guys rock
Please don’t Rocket die.  I love he and Groot
Knull decapitated the head. I hope to see Venom play a role soon
i cannot keep doing this i have left all of the last mcu movies in tears please god (Kevin feige) let me feel joy again
Maybe Mantis in sort of a Celestial Madonna situation with Kang at the end?
Maybe it's Mantis
its gonna be mantis. they set it up too perfectly with them finding out they're siblings.
6:05 Drax being tickled by the bullets would still make sense. Tickling is caused by stimulation of pain receptors. So both being shot by bullets and being pelted by an object would be considered painful, maybe the bullets were just so small that they stimulated the pain receptors differently.
Just watched this to see if that was Adam Warlock.
It’s gonna be draxx since it’s his last appearance
I am gonna make a prediction that might prove false but we will see. Dave Butista has said he is likely not playing drax anymore after this. I think rocket is gonna get a sacrifice moment but at the last second drax will take his place, they have been building up the drax and rocket antagonistic friendship in the past movies so it would be a pretty cool twist.
It’s going to be drax
Great video! Can't wait for this movie!
I think mantis is the one to die
80's?...New Men?....Newman?...Randy Newman songs? Maybe?
Groot seems like he's growing up into king groot which would be pretty dope
Looks like somehow Adam has the same stone vision had, how.
Drax is gonna die
Either rocket or drax. I believe drax
I’m calling it now nobody’s gonna die
actually, Groot does bleed red blood in the rocket and Groot comics that were released in 2016 there was a scene with Groot showing that he has Mutiple red hearts along with blood vessels
This reminds me of "THE ISLAND OF DOCTOR MONROE".
That kid is definitely gonna have CTE.
Abnett and Lanning is still the best run.
when is  it coming  out?
4 legged creature looks to have an orb on the head so I'd guess the Cosmo dog!
it's among us
I won't be crying none of these movies touch me in that way..
That rocket scene is maybe captured again and Lila just died
I wonder if they will mention that the eye socket. (If it is that) has adamantium somewhere on it
AH MUNG US game
didnt gamora die in infinity war?
please tell me rockets not going to die
* Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; To declare, * I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.   (Romans 3:25-26) * having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.   (Colossians 1:20) * In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:   (Colossians 1:14) Praise ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.   (Psalm 147:1)
If the trailer makes me cry the movie is gonna make me bawl my eyes out and I’m ready for it
"We'll all fly away together, one last time, into the forever and beautiful sky"
I think rockets white background scene is in Adam warlocks mind like the cartoon
That pink stuff isn't the nova resin from the guardians game on gamepass?
I think that Meredith had the x gene
Does anyone have any clue why Peter's neck implant did NOT translate the rabbit guys' speech??
I think mantis is going to die causing Peter quill to  freak out. Because it's like he's destined to be alone. Rocket and drax will fight to the death. So no telling
I think Peter screaming is he in some way witnessing his mothers death just now as an adult,, I will go further to say this is being shown to him to prove some sort of point by the High Evolutionary
I really think Mantis is going to die.
in 13:30, isn't it possible that in the flashback it's just Rocket being depressed? If you look closely at the things laying around him, it kinda looks like cigarettes? I'm guessing it wouldn't /be/ cigarettes but something similar maybe to make the viewer connect easier. It's also such a classic depressed person camera shot, surrounded by his mess around him, naked or with little clothes, saying a deep quote. I think it's also notable that the floor it's some kind of drain? If not a depressed shot it might also be that he and other subjects are about to be killed.
Imagine everyone is expecting rocket to die and it just ends up being dracks
There orange uniforms I feel like is a reference to how they all met in the first movie in prison.
Lyla could be a villain
This is gonna be soo good. Literaly cant wait. Honestly I dont even need to hear “Booooooom looking for this!?” in this movie, to give it 9.9/10, 10/10 even.
When you pointed out the beaked creature with Bert hair… it made me notice that the Panda that you cut to next is wearing Ernie’s shirt.  PLEASE tell me that the street sign says Sesame Street… or someone else will be named Mr. Hooper. 🤣
Something tells me that Rocket is going to die in this movie....
I might have to start watching these movies, this looks dope.
I think the guardians could be traveling inside rocket to try and save him.
am i the only one that came to the comments looking for comments about Fallout? lol
That's not just any bird... that's a Cassowary. That is the deadliest bird in the world, seriously though things scared Steve Irwin.
The death could be from Gamora that's why Peter is so emotional but probably Drax since Dave doesn't want to play as him anymore. It could go any way even Rocket or Peters half sister Mantis no one is safe in this movie.
I’d say drax or nebula die
Watch Mantis die
My thoughts, Mantis is crying because Peter is crying, and Peter would only grieve that hard over Gamora or his mother.
What are the chances we get to see Blackjack in this movie? If this movie really does break down Rocket's origin, Blackjack might be a part of it.
rocket will die here mark my word
Looks like the blood is dripping from a scalpel. I'd say Adam attacks Nowhere, and Rocket gets kidnapped. I think the trailer is misdirection us to think Rocket died being experimented on. I think it will be Drax that is killed. He's featured a lot in the trailer, and he and Mantis were featured the most in the Christmas special. I think it's to get us more emotionally attached to the character to make the scene more impactful.
The space suits remind me  especially the yellow one of the mad quarantine clean up crew monsters from monsters inc hahah
SPACEHOG- in the meantime is the name of the song. Lead singer Royston Langdon was married to Liv Tyler.
I used to just like watching you break shit down. Your not that no more. Going 2000%
I go to the LA FILM SCHOOL IN HOLLYWOOD LOL I WAS THERE in LA
I would put money on Drax dying. Also,  since Adam was Made to kill the GOTG, I bet he is like a side quest compared to Herbert.  Maybe Adam kills Drax?  And maybe Peter convinces Adam that they aren't the bad guys, and Adam joins them in the end.  Those are my guesses.
YES Voss is back!
Gunn better kill it with this one and then I perfect trilogy like them more than the avengers
Ya... that's a goat, not a rabbit. Have you ... never seen a goat?
Am I the only one that thinks they are going into the Celestials intestine and the hairs are cillia?
we just gonna skip past Nebula's arm?
Baby rocket makes me want to cry 😢
Rocket is my boy, I really hope they don't kill him off because GOTG is my favorite marvel movie and that would just ruin it for me.
I’m thinking either rocket or drax will die. Leaning more towards drax.
Rocket better not die.
DBE cemented their status in the U.K. scene
You know how some electrical wires have a flat end so you can use a screw to mechanical connect the wire to a terminal. I think that's what the object with dripping blood is. Maybe it's a very rough put together implant.
Meredith Quill is NoWhere lol
drax wasn’t in pain form the rock he was just mildly annoyed 💀
Only the LORD GOD Can Complete you, Just as Butter in FACT Does Complete ALL Dishes(I know bc I have Did it, and As far as JESUS, HE Came to me and I have Learned and and Still Learning to TRUST IN GOD, Pray for me tho? And I'll Pray for you, GOD Bless you Bruthas and Sistahs.)
A thought occurred: maybe Rocket hates being called a raccoon because that’s what the High Evolutionary kept calling him? Rocket infers it as a slur, so that’s why he lashes out?
Where did detail #1 go????
8:57 I'm pretty sure the suits just have to do with their actual bodies. Gamora is green, Nebula is blue, Drax has red colorings, Mantis has pale orange skin like a human, and Peter has blonde hair.
the colors on mantisis arm could be a nod to power rangers in space
8:27  Am I the only one that thought of Power Rangers?
Gamora and nebula gonna die ,
I thought ur favorite MCU film was Captain America 2
Are you going to make a cameo in this movie? 🤔
Bautista gonna die. Its the end of his contract
I don’t know how anyone follows this anymore. Not the general public at least.
good song 👍🏻
I think the colored suits scene is an Innerspace/Magic School Bus style trip into Rocket's body
Maybe cut out the caffeine...
The image of rocket on his back he’s got pellets all around him. Betting it’s an early time frame and he’s in a animal cage.
That isn't Knowhere's eye.  It's Knowhere's b-hole.  I'm calling it.
At the end
if it’s what groot said?
What is set at the end?
Peter’s mom was a mutant. They couldn’t say that all the way back in Guardians 1 but now they can and that’s what makes Peter so special and able to connect to his Celestial genes
It's gonna be Drax
Is nobody talking about the fact that Lylla the otter is gonna be in the movie🥰
What if Peter crying out is because he is watching the moment of his mom's death again. That fleshy thing they land on could be Ego reforming, and it could tie back to Peter's mom.
Wanda and cosmo are in the marvel universe
Looks like the whole that's in no where
Rocket better not die, or I'm going to call Kevin Feige and tell him that he needs to bring him back somehow
Drax saying that at the end of the trailer makes me believe he's going to be the one to die and then his daughter is revealed to be alive and joins the Guardians in his father's place.
So Drax is tickled by bullets from law enforcement when he abducts Kevin Bacon, but rocks thrown from animal people hurt and are cause for retaliation.
Maybe Meredith got the extra genes from Steve Rogers :D
Rocket is going to die
It's Drax. He's wounded and end of the contract.
That scene where rocket is in a white prison area reminds me of the scene from the guardians fame when Peter and rockers are arming at each other and cosmo knocks them out (idk).
I bet they kill off Drax because Dave Batista wanted out of Guardians
I could see Lila (don't know if I spelt it right) being the one who d!3s but Peter wouldn't have that much of a reaction but it might be Drax since he had that blast mark on his chest or it could be Rocket because of all those flash backs it could his life flashing before his eyes or it could just be Rocket explaining his backstory (this was my personal opinion)
5:20 - they are chimera.  It's a Biblical thing - I think only referenced once in the entire Bible - can't recall where right now, but I do know it's Biblical.  Chimera were in the days of Noah - the fallen angels doing DNA testing - Because Satan deceived; and was angry because he knows his time is short.  (It is written, Hell was made for the devil and his angels).  In any case... "chimera" - that's what that term refers to.  In Noah's day - Everything was screwed up in regards to DNA, thoughts, heart, etc - all translations say that, & the original language indicates that.  Noah was "perfect in his generations" it says - (and his family) - and it means his DNA was correct.  Noah was part of Jesus's ancestry.  Noah's DNA was correct.  It wasn't corrupt. The fallen angels and Satan were doing everything they could to STOP Jesus from coming into this world.
The Island of Dr Moreau on steroids XD
What if that super ego / celestial zombie becomes galactus?
Love your videos. The theories and speculations you give are truly fan based, legitimate and logical. When me and my comic book friends would get together, we'd have discussions like this. We've all got our own lives now, so we don't get to get together like we used to. When we do, though, our conversations are much like your videos. Thank you for them.🙂👍
Was that Winter soldier’s arm? At 12:00 Rocket did joke he wanted it. Lmao
I have a feeling that Bradley Cooper himself will physically be in this movie!!
MANTIS is sadly gonna bite the dust, thereby making Peter truly alone hence why he's crying soooooo much. 😑😕🥲🥲🥲. Whenever Peter finds someone he loves, they leave. Sad but true
They are shrunk and enter Rockets system. Groot stays with Rocket. Just my guess
I think the high revolutionary is taking Peter s DNA to make a celestial, they might get Mantis too since that's his sister, to make Galactus, and nowhere probably will be the homebase spot for them to come up with a game plan to go at Galactus and silver surfer, mighty strange silver surfer s special on Disney plus coming soon then the GOTG buy a celestial head.... floating In space....
MY NAME JEFF
Hell appear to be dead then come back in his body he's been building
Spiderpeter lost his aunt Guardianpeter loses his sister
Nova Corps most likely would have plenty of time to rebuild. Remember it was years before the Avengers tried to undo the snap. When they did all the Nova corps that were snapped away would come back. My guess is that the Nova Corps is alive and well.
clearly peters mom
What if Meredith quil is Steve Rogers daughter. And the super soldier serum passed through the bloodline and that activated celestial gene in Peter.
I thought it was swole Groot in the red suit. I guess Groot wouldn't need a space suit though huh?
Nothing Goes Over Drax's head.. but if aimed directly at his head... is a different story!... he aint catching ish!.. lmao..
Earth had a celastials sead
*LIKE ❤THIS COMMENT ❤IF YOU LIKE GUARDIANS THE SAME *
Why is griot so buff
I can’t find any allergy information at Bokksu
Nope. Rockets gonna die.
15:43 imagine the person in the table is peters mom that would be crazy
Benatar is way more better then The Bowie
Well Drax did have a gun shot wound so I’m going to guess it’s him that is on the operating table
Isn’t that Luke Cages brother 🤷🏾‍♂️😂
DRAX IS GONNA DIE!
So, Gotg part 3. I liked it better when it was called The Island of Dr. Moreu.
Calling it now. Meredith Quoll is/was da skrull.
𝒶𝓂ℴ𝓃ℊ 𝒰𝒮
How is Gamora alive if this is after the blip
I didn't notice it before but one of Lylla's arms is robotic.
The white interior looks pretty identical to Ego's ship's interior. Also Groot looks so weird, like a Disney mascot character walking around. Why not just make him look like vol. 1 groot?
What's with fiege
10:12
The space suits could be packman reference
Lol the ships colour does not match the guardians outfits 🤣
I like the sneaky inclusion of "Roundabout" in the very beginning
I feel like all the scene of the trailer are to mislead us into thinking the death will be rockets but I feel like we’re gonna lose drax
Drax will die because Bautista is following Gunn to the DC universe.
I don’t think it’s Rocket who died but Mantis because he just find out that he’s sister
i think that swull groot should otherwise or also be known as groot jr
I feel like mantis is showing  Star Lord his mother dying
i think it could be mantis who gets killed when peter is screaming
I think it's the fact that meredith is a mutant!!🙂😁🤙
I thought this was a Cancerverse scenario but it makes more sense that it's Celestial matter
17:40 That's definitely Rocket in his ancestral plain or whatever its called considering for him there are cages in the background
I think mantis will die
They are going to kang's world to the antman and the wasp 3
Wait, the guardians ship colors match their uniforms??? Are you blind? Ship is aqua or teal and pink. Uniforms are dark blue and maroon. The same uniforms as in Andor.
Kyla’s arm at 14 min.
I think Mantis will die.
If you listen closely, the first note they play in the trailer is taken directly from Roundabout by Yes, AKA the TO BE CONTINUED... song from JoJo.
That image of baby Rocket was heartbreaking with the fear in his eyes. I wanted to take the owner of that hand and subject him to the worst about of torture he deserves.
Maybe they're going to Glenn Rhee it and have Gamora's death in Infinity War be a set up to the death of alternate universe's Gamora 🤷‍♂.
The idea of Drax dying is possible but highly unlikely. He literally died in Infinity War, killing him off again would be kind of lame. He might receive a proper goodbye some other way. Rocket is the only guardian we haven’t seen a death of. He is most likely going to die.
In particular…
Peter crying for his mother death or?
No.. It's Among Us
Draxs going to die.
im starting to wonder to correlation between rocket and procstics that mans leg and buckys arm lol
“And that belt is made of leather” 😂😂😂
Thank you for singing a sond trailer
Wait, who unalived Knowhere?
Hear me out… Meredith Quill… was a Skrull
The only marvel films worth a watch these days, can’t wait
I reckon Peter can still access his celestial power, but just thinks he can't.  Think about it, why would Ego call him a battery. According to Ego all of Peters extra abilities come from the light in the planet, but that's just Ego's brain.  I reckon Peter's brain is like that (glowing full of celestial power), makes sense because Ego needed the power of two celestials.
i can see someone making a reference of red is sus
My thoughts are Mantis is imparting Rocket's painful memories onto Peter.
Rocket is totally laying the bottom of a cage.  You can see standard rodent food pellets laying on the floor behind him.
Maybe mantis is just showing Peter one of Rockets memories (I.E. him getting mutilated by high evolutionary)
Rocket and Lylla hugging omg 🥹😍
Power Stone = Herbert Windham. You're on to something.
Peter looked like his heart had been ripped out. He might of lost gamora again.
Fun fact the groot we have now isn’t the same groot we have have now it’s actually his son
I feel like the thing they're jumping around on in the multi colored suits could be rocket. It looks like they might've shrunk down and are floating around somewhere in his eye maybe
What is Star Lords mother is actuly Moon Dragon who in the comic is Drax daughter
The answer is the city is always Atlanta.  Every scene of every city and every building.
Mantis is dying
Laila will be the trap that will drag rocket to the high evolutionary that will sent the guardians there where warlock is there and Chaos begins
I believe that rocket and his girlfriend are the mother and father of all the people on the high evolutionary's planet. So to speak
drax, obviously.
Looks like Quill is tackling someone out of the statute of liberty crown.  The shape of the windows seem to correlate
8:26 AMONG US. 😁
Drax, nebular and Rocket all dead.
I agree that the "we'll all fly away" Rocket is younger. I think the cybernetic implants on his face are fresh, so his fur hasn't had time to grow back over them yet. Like the ones on his back, they're always there but usually hidden - under fur in this case, rather than clothes.
It's Rocket's turn to die. Unfortunately this time no Infinity stones to ressurect him 😜
I'm wondering if Herbert Wyndham also has the ability to break the 4th wall...  the way he's looking at the camera directly during that treadmill scene is just so wierd to me...
ahhhh so the " dont get too attached"  line applies here too... well played Mr.Gunn well played
How is Gamora alive??
Isn’t there a possibility that Meredith is Steve Roger’s daughter? 🤔🤔
Prepared to cry badly on this one
More kitchen nightmare reviews! This was gold
People have theorized rocket because the title has been the same color of the character who died. The first was groot and then the second was yandu. It could be rocket or Lylla. However it could also be drax since the original logo they released had more draxx colors than it does currently and they could be trying to throw us off.
If Rocket and Nebula die it'd make sense, they're the only two out of the Guardians that haven't "died" yet.
I believe mantis will die. They told us another person is related to starlord marvel more so the MCU universe lure is the related gets killed.
Lyla can be the replacement for Rocket just like other Avenger Characters
American Pie by Don McLean should be used for the second trailer or in the actual movie
Adam Warlock looks pretty cool. Hopefully Marvel does a good job exploring his character and role in this movie and moving forward.
Among us
Love your videos !
My guess: Drax is gonna die.
Is anyone else upset with Adam Warlock or is it just me
43:47 minutes left in Guardians of the Galaxy volume 1 we have the clue of the character that will die in this movie.
oh i just KNOW this film will make me cry so many times
So since Thor 4 screwed up knowheres lore with gorr beheading the celestial with the necrosword I wonder who is now responsible for decapitation of knowhere to begin with?
Jesus how do you know all this stuff
I think that it's rocket on the table and they are removing his sentience chip to make him go back to before his mind was augmented
I CAN NOT WAIT for this movie to come out. It comes out the day after my birthday…
When are you guys going to one on avatar 2
Honestly I think drax is the one on the operating table
I thought the beginning of the trailer was roundabout by yes
I got a Tele-Tubbies vibe when i seen all the different colored space suits... Lmao
Drax gonna die I’m certain of it
I feel like drax is dying
YOOO FIRST GOTG MOVIE IS MY FAV MCU MOVIE TOOOO
I really hope they don’t kill rocket because he is like my favorite character
Yup. Rockets gonna die
The song. . . .In the Meantime. . . its SO perfect for this trailer.
E.Voss, who is Quill yelling and crying over ? It's not Rocket is it?  And is the soul stone in Adam forehead.. if so, how?
Drax does in this one n mantis
The way quill cried it could have been kraglin
I feel drax dying has more purpose than rocket. And rocket is the favorite guardian. I think the movie will end with them splitting up and rocket and groot need to stay together
I hope this is a good movie, I’ve been disappointed in the last few marvel movies and series.
Why can’t they just let them fly off in to space all alive and all together?
this is gonna be so sick
13:49 That shot is definitely from Rocket's past. Those niblets scattered around him look like pet food, and the line makes a lot of sense when said to his fellow captives.
I don’t understand how legally Gunn can work for DC it seems like Marvel wouldn’t allow it
I want to say the death in this movie will be Drax, seems like that shot to the chest could have an impact on him living and the scene where Quill and Mantis are crying is Drax dying. Plus its confirmed that Dave is exiting the character
I personally think rocket won't die, I could see it being Layla or Drax. Also believe Warlock will save the guardians from the high evolutionary somehow.
I am looking forward to the movie. It’s about time they make a third movie. But I was expecting the continuation of the movie from the ending of Vol. 2. So I’m kind of disappointed that it won’t be a continuation to what happened at the post credits scene. But I am hoping that they make Cineplex toppers for the third movie.
ale gbegbe be eƒe nu léa dzi na ame.
God loves you
Couldnt that thing they flew through be a layer over the eye like one we have to protect from crap scratching stuff in the eye?
I thought the flesh thing they walk on in the colorful space suits was the quarantine zone from the guardians of the galaxy video game
That's a cassowary not a peacock 😇
Omg I can’t wait.. can’t believe Adam Warlock, High Evolutionary and Kang are in the mcu now omg and were also gonna get Sentry, Silver surfer, Galactus and Doctor doom 😱 I wish I could time travel!
Rocket raccoon, flamethrower ferret, and pulsegun possum.
I got it!! Starlords mom was part mutant thats why he was able to successfully blend with Egos genome. Its all going that way so why not.
Not to be cruel but the ball into the head shot from Drax, OMG that was hilarious! I know I'm a weirdo, but head shots are always hilarious as are people falling on their rear ends.
15:40 Clearly hes screaming because the high evolutionary is turning him into a walrus
i see cosmo and adam warlock
Gamora is alive ?
So still no Transformers reaction? It’s cool, you just lost a subscriber
When I watched the trailer for the first time I thought Peter screaming was a reaction to something disgusting because of the scalpel shot
Do transformers
That's not a fly swatter! It's Netan! 😂🤣
They better nail this movie
I don’t see them killing rocket if anyone it’s going to be Drax… they better not kill rocket 😡
My hunch is that Peter's agonized "scream" is just his comedic overreaction to something kinda gross. Idk.
If they kill Rocket we riot 👹👹👹👹
The fact that Rocket did manage to get that arm in the Holiday Special seems that maybe Marvel is tying some loose ends with him before he's written out.
This trailer tried to lead us to understand that Rocket would be gone. But I believe it's Mantis
Gotta have a small connection with Antman 3 If that's true though 😳
I'm convinced... QUILL'S GONNA DIIIE! (Or maybe DRAX based on Mantis' sobbing?)
The debris around Rocket look kind of looks like food pellets you'd feed a hamster. Fits in with it being a flashback to when he  was in a cage.
13:17 rocket is in a cage if you look there is pellets on the ground around him like in a rabbit cage or something...also pretty sure that's a hand holding a machete with blood dripping 15:45
Drax gonna be the one to die in this one. Callin it now
Dr Moreau for sure
Hershel walker is smarter then drax vote for him
Will we get a Tigra from this movie?
very  very goog
I’m just going to keep believing that there are indeed multiple universes where some beloved character hasn’t died and is still thriving 🥲 it’s the only way to keep my psyche in tact at this point
Doesn’t Adam Warlock become good and join the avengers in the comics ?
You know what other team Cosmo is most famous for creating? The Annihilators. Hopefully they don't make the massive mistake of making Galactus the main Cosmic villain but instead adapt Annihilation and make Annihlus the main Cosmic villain. I'm hoping that the Nova special is the beginning of the Annihilation arc as Richard Rider is the main mc of the comic run.
Always remember that trailers are cut together in such a way as to tease and entice you to watch the movie. I expect we'll see everything shown, but I also assume we're being misdirected. For example, the drop of blood and Peter's reaction might be totally unrelated. And if a major character is going to die, it's almost certainly not going to be the one implied by the trailer.
Maybe Peter's mom is a Skrull
If they kill off rocket I'm done
Im gonna be be honest it seems like it is gonna be rocket 😭 Peter wouldn't scream for Laila
16:28 Ngl, I thought that was someone else.
You just know robocop will be the first diss quill says
Why does Groot look so buff?
These days Ragnarok is probably my number 1 but Guardians vol 1 is definitely close behind.
Guardians of the Galaxy IS the Marvel Fast and the Furious..... it's all just about... FAMILY
wow.... not sure what to say....I don't think Drax is dying..... I'm pretty sure... it's Peter....
A t like Marvel…doesn’t throw folks off w/the previews…lol  Bottom line…they know how 2 hide shat I plain sight…
Since there was Kree language on the sign, maybe that's a hint of some Kree showing up. 🤔
Rocket die very sad
Quill finds his mother as an animal hybrid ( crying scene )
I'm wondering if it is a misdirect and we will be loosing Drax. Just a thought.
that scene where peter is screaming, i think thats rocket or a guardian dying, why would he scream so much about layla dying, maybe it’s even drax, i’m pre sure he will die
I loved drax
Wait half world even better welcome home rocket raccoon 🤫🤔😅
How did you miss rocket's ears? It's obviously a flashback, he's got juvenile smaller rounded ears.
🦦
I love thee characters,  l don't want nun of them  die.
It either going to be drax or gamora who will die
Hmm if Ego gave Quill’s mom a tumor, ultimately caused by mutations, could Quill’s special attribute that is the secret Easter egg be that he is a mutant of some sorts?
You had it reversed: Bzermikitokolok learned about Christmas from Rocket who learened from Cosmo who learned from Kraglin and Kraglin learened about Christmas straight from Quill
This trailer immediately made me go watch the Christmas Special and after watching it.. I can't believe I never realized that Mantis was Peter's sister
If anyone does die im sure warlock will resurrect them
Holiday specials are canon now? Great more things I have to watch to understand the movies 🫠
Maybe Rocket's fascination with robotic arms comes from Lyla.
Where's the transformers !!!!
There is isn secret cameo. Gunn is baiting you guys so hard
No.. quill is the one being experimented on.. getting killed... its quill's blood. Looking at quill getting carried looks like he lacks color.. lack of blood maybe?
You should review the transformers trailer
*13:40** That's not him dying, that's Rocket being constructed*
obviously its gonna be rocket, theyve hinted it alot
They could be foreshadowing rocket dying with draxx’s last statement because in the second movie yondu and rocket talk about his irrational fear of being loved
The suits remind me of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers when they went skydiving.
I think Peter and or mantis will die
I don’t want rocket to die BUT i am 100% down with that decision if they make it and that is because of how much of an emotional gut punch it will be
I would rather it be ended on their own terms tbh
No shot Quill is screaming like that over Lylla 💀
endgame trailers gave a lot of death flags for tony by focusing on him a lot and he still died
Quil discovers he's Adam Warlocks father and after a rough start between Father and Son he joins the Guardians of the Galaxy to help stop the High Evolutionary from filling a power vacuum in the Universe in the absence of the late Thanos which threatens to have consequences for the entire Universe while Gamoras's off hunting down the last of the Children of Thanos who still pose a threat as they gather to  fight and monger over what's left of  thier fathers empire and forces. The High Evolutionary among the Children of Thanos emerges to pose the greatest emmediat threat, Rocket being a critical key to his plans.
I think that Adam warlock looks bad
THEY BETTER NOT TOUCH THAT RACOON
Gamora is out of time (time stone)
Why are they dressed as Morlana Corporate Security from Andor?
Peter and Drax both die. Mark my words
Rocket gonna die
Gamora has never looked better!
i am stab
Red sus
Is the missing Easter egg the The Hangover reference in GOTG 1..... "It's not a purse, it's a satchel".... Was that connected or......
0:28 I’m in la I’m the gettos but with my ticket money I’m down, also hope to talk about my atom formers in comparison to the fictional Star Trek replicators, wakunda 3d printers and more, ought to look up this possibly online space cadets
I think drax is gonna die  Let’s see if it comes true
I think Drax will die and Adam Warlock kills him.. the guardians  tried to save him through operation.. but nothing worked and they have watch him die 😭💔
I think Mantis will die
Drax is going to die
are the coordinates xmen comics, making Meridith a mutant?
I think drax is gonna die
the only mcu movie ive been excited for... take my money... its going to break all the records.. im scared for rockets tho, i know im going to cry like a baby
I think at least mantis and drax will die in this movie
I feel that either rocket or drax will die
i think maybe the person dying could be mantis! The emotional connection now of being half sister! The need to try to go for celestial blood too!
The scene where Peter is screaming is probably his mom, somehow having to relive it as an adult, and mantis is there too
Ey they referenced the among us characters with the space suits
8:30 AMOGUS.
Wouldn’t be surprised if most, maybe all of them died before the end
I thought the fleshy planet stuff was egos body he was also a celestial
Did you really just pronounce “RIP” like that? It’s the same amount of syllables to say the full “Rest in Peace” properly?! :’)
I pray rocket doesnt die
Drax is probably one that will get killed off.. Bautista said hes done with the GOTG and marvel in general and wants to go on to different projects.. reason we see him wearing a Christmas sweater and an actual outfit in Volume 3, shows less time in the makeup stage. Probably too long a process for him to go through anymore. Specially since he has sensitive nipples he wouldn't be wearing a shirt at all
I think Star-Lord will die
And you all have not said a thing about the Otter having a robot hand/arm.
Mantis is a baddie 🔥🔥
How is gemora alive???
Hopefully we see more of Mantis and Drax backstory
I want marvel to bring the One Above All to the MCU
peter screaming got me thinking gamora again ?
"Trash Otter"
Pretty sure they kill starlord, drax and rocket
Rocket doesn't call him "Quill"--he calls him "Pete".
Went to the Guardians of the Galaxy ride at Epcot this past Wed - As you walk in and wait, there are paraphernalia and stuff - one included a picture of 3 ships - One was called the STARJAMMER_   Scott Summers dad was the Capt. of a  ship with that name and a crew of space pirates  The Starjammers figured significantly in the Uncanny X-Men story arc "The Rise and Fall of the Shi'ar Empire", a 12-issue story arc following on the events of X-Men: Deadly Genesis. - go to Wikipedia for more details
Rocket is going to die
Rocket and Drax calling it now
That scene of Rocket where its all white behind him look almost like that scene of the white King’s Cross station where Harry and Dumbledore meet again
It's been so long since I've read those. Is Wyndham from Earth?  Jeezy I don't remember that
What if it’s galore that’s Dieing
The Ford pinto you showed was not from the '80s it was from the '70s.
Drax is going to die. Batista said this is his last movie I think that’s what is going to happen.
idk.... If that is a death scene with Quill screaming like that there's only one person it could be of to get that kind of reaction.... Gomorrah....
Is Margot Robby going to play Rogue?
hey i think star lords and mantis's celestial ancestry will be linked to the story by the evolutionary trying to use their dna to enhance his projects
Ahh Furrys
Is Rhodey still alive?  Not falling for this cheap trick again
I just know this movie will be the best MCU movie to date 🥹🥹
Easy one of the best Marvel Movies Trailers!
How fn stupid.
Are we gunna get a Super Mario Bros Movie break down?
Please, I can't take ANOTHER marvel death
I think drax will die since drax was the one who originally said he was done with the guardians of the galaxy but I don’t see rocket dying he’s to popular in the avengers
Anyone else expecting a ship to crash through a window into the bad guys face with a perfectly timed one liner?? GUNN is  2 FOR 2 so far
I'll be ballin face 😭😭😭😭 if I see Rocket die. I can't .
I hope that’s not sexual harassment Panda….
It’s crazy to see them becoming less comedic and more serious every movie and Thor doing the opposite 😭 but GOTG has not missed once!!!!!
Jesus is good be good back to him he died for you and please choose him I don’t want you to be judged by him since I’m the Bible it says that he will judge everyone that doesn’t follow him, please choose him choose Jesus it’s worth it I pray this word bless your life in Jesus name amen.
Well the tubes are to big for rocket body and it’s not groot for obvious reasons not Peter so it’s honestly between the Rest of the crew
This movie is going to break me. I can feel it
I'm thinking Drax or Mantis.
Will mis you drax nebula
It’s going to be funny and even disappointing if they all live after that trailer.
Hey, when this comes out in theaters, can y'all discuss the details two weeks after? That way people can at least have somewhat of a chance to watch it.
Allysa Milano, Pat Benatar, David Bowie. A mighty 80s lineup.
I think drax is going to die in this movie and there’s going to be a line where he says something along the lines of “I can join my family now”
We're the Millers ruined Will Poulter for me.  I'd pay twice the admission to see him run around yelling "Spider bit me! Bit me on my balls!" when defeated.
So help me if Rocket is in any danger, this will legit be the last dumbest mistake Disney can make, at least for me....
I think drax is going to die, I think he's on that table.
If they kill off rocket im gonna be some type of way.
Everyone except Peter and Groot are going to die. This is going to be a comedy that gets very tragic, very quickly.
I do agree that we will see a simplified origin for Adam Warlock but I would flip that. I think it's going to be mostly the Sovereign and the High Evolutionary maybe assisted.
at 13:53 it’s food pellets on a cage
If they can have a 4th Thor movie, why can't they give us a 4th guardians movie? Guardians is the best out of all the movies in the MCU
R.I.P Draxs
You had to bring up Michael Scott and his childhood trauma!! 😂🤣
I wonder if the colorful space suits are a tie into the Infinity Watch? 🤔 Just spitballing here.
That ring section is not spinal cord but probably the celestial butthole. Rocket wont die, he will be probably be de-revolutionized back to his original form.
Is it possible that Captain America is Peter's grandfather, Meterdith's father? Perhaps why his DNA was capable of sustaining Celestial DNA?
How did you miss the spacesuit color connection to Disney’s “Inside Out”? yellow for joy (Quill, Comic Relief) blue for sadness/regret/resentment (Nebula) red for anger (Drax) Orange (subbed for purple for fear (Mantis - timid prior to Holiday Special) green for disgust (Gamora)
Knowhere is Ego's head. the brain floated far away. It's meredith's x like ex husband
I think drax will pass away in this movie, I know he can't stand the makeup/suit he wears
Idk why but I feel like that person's blood is from Mantis ☹
they are absolutely shrunken down navigating Rockets body in those Among Us suits IMO.
It’s sad Cosmo wasn’t in this trailer a lot. Also, Groot could be in the green suit.
Usually a trailer shows all the best scenes, this trailer showed nothing worth watching other than nostalgia. Very troubling.
Koo
Loving the idea that maybe, just maybe, Rocket's world may happen to be the world where the animal-like Thor will come from.
I'm basically like Batista " kill one stupid person no one loves " Priceless line 🤣🤣🤣🤣/
OMG Rocket is gonna die. I got a bad feeling. F*** F*** F***  Ok lets watch the video now.
So many characters die, i guess multiverse saga is no joke
The humanoid in that is running is actually a Mutant, easter egging the Sinister and X-Men
Why is Gamora still alive????? Can someone help im confused
While Rocket is hugging Lylla, I don't believe that is a flashback because you can see, in his hand, he's holding a cassette tape.
This is obviously going to set up doom coming with fantastic four as doom and high evolutionary cross in comics..if I remember correctly?
I believe Peter Quill's mother was a Celestial that wanted to be human just like in the movie Eternals.
I think groot, peter, mantis and gamora live. Just to kill us Peter will die.
Dead will die and mantis will die.
Drax is probably dying here
Yeah just kill of all the marvel heroes we know love and replace them with characters we barely know or care about that should work out fine 👍
Not sure how canon the game lore is to the movies. But in the game. Rocket says that he watched lyla die and thats what drove him down his path.
I don't think that's a death scene where we the blood dripping. I think that looks more like a tool, possibly one of the tools The High Evolutionary uses to operate on rocket during a flashback
Nooooo don't let Rocket die
I think it may be drax that bites the dust
What happened to the benetar
When the Gotg 3 logo comes in, the outline surrounding the logo makes a 7 shape, and the 7 og gotg members are Drax, Star Lord, Gamora, Groot, Mantis, Rocket, Nebula
Holy hell this looks incredible. Looks like this will be in the Top 5 MCU films ever
I think is mantis what is kill it!
Hopefully it’s actually good like the trailer put it out to be and isn’t another Halloween ends
I hope that Rocket doesn’t die, instead decides to retire from the guardians and live the rest of his life with Lyla.
pretty sure its  been established Batista didn't wanna continue  with the films. Drax  is the one dying.
I bet the statue of Liberty is the animal version.
Drax is going to die in GotG3. I have a feeling.
What if the high evolutionary created ego and that’s why they were mining the planet knowwhere for its dna
there could be some use of bucky arm by rocket in this film'
The scene of Rocket lying on his back has a bunch of "twig-like" items littering the floor. They look like they could be either: food pellets (like you'd see at a petting zoo, or can buy from a pet shop) OR, biodegradable "kitty litter" (like "Yesterday's News"  - which is made of recycled newspaper).  This reinforces the idea that he's a "lab-rat" (er...  "raccoon-thing").
ITS BECAUSE THEIR MUTANTS!  Star Lord and Mantis are MUTANTS with the Celestial Gene 🔥🔥
It’s got to be drax death as he’s not returning in the future franchise
the fleshy structure i think is The Continuum Cortex
I think they are inside of Rocket
I think Peter is going to die
I don't wanna go......  I don't wanna go......
We knew this movie was going to be a tearjerker anyway, but looks like it might be another Logan level tearjerker.
Rocket is gonna die in this movie
I like the way you said "the Muppet? BERT?"
Drax will die and Adam will replace him
Stupid trailer where’s Adam
I think Rocket will die in this movie.. simply because he is the onely one, who doesnt at this point.. Groot died in first movie, Gamora in infinity war, drax mantis and quill also (they were dusted so it can be count) and nebula kill herself in endgame.. and like they say, there is allways a first time so rip rocket 😄
The 6 rainbow colors that you've mentioned @9:02 on Mantis represent the homosexual alphabet group. These movies must "check off" and display these colors, homosexuality, feminism, emasculation, and minorities.
I hope we see an easter of a live action BoJack Horseman cause clearly him and Rocket are from the same planet.
It will be mantis that's quil is crying over or a recreation of his mother...
Idk why I feel so but I think Mantis is going to die
Drax, Rocket, Kraglen all dead
Everyone’s going to die in this movie, it’s the end of the guardians.
despite the fast talking, this video is super uninformative if you're here to hear about the trailer instead of lore from external sources
What that rabbit said. Ain't that from Mork & Mindy
Star-Lord is Holding The Dying Body Of Rocket Groot😭😭😭
While watching the trailer, I feel like crying but don't know when. 😅
are you going to start interviewing the actors?
I must been living under a rock, because i did'n know that Gomorrah is back ?.
Peter loses his sister to gain his love back
I think Drax's anger in the post title is his response to a death. Drax reacts for revenge, just like he did in GotG.
I’m ready to fight over baby rocket I’m sorry!  Pirates have a code be ready 🏴‍☠️
they said it batista last movie in the guardians
At 9:00, instead of an eye socket, this more resembles an ear canal, or ear drum. Maybe it has something to do with the squelch/dB meter in the opening sequence. The hair follicles are what drew me to this conclusion. There are no random hair follicles in an eye socket, but there are inside of the ear canal
I agree it's to obvious to be rocket. For me it's Drax dying when they are crying.
9:03 - It's Knowhere's digestive system. And the hole is...well...it's the hole.
The thing with the blood dripping off looks like a scalpel.  It seems like some of the guardians will be abducted and experimented on by the high evolutionary.
I feel Rocket and Drax will die in GotG3 :/
I guess the one who is gonna die is mantis 'cause peter is seeing his sister die......
I think the blood we see is actualy Rocket's blood when he was made up. I think the one who die is Drax ,that whole on the chest really look bad
I think it might be Drax.  The type of comedy provides would make his death that more tragic.  But at least he'd get to see his family again.
Honestly I’m just wondering what the hell happened to the benatar
Of course Rocket is going to die. His entire arc from the first movie to the last set him up to sacrafice himself in the third movie
Herbert probably sent Adam to get Rocket from knowhere. Adam left the guardians beaten and kidnapped Rocket
When Quill is screaming - his eyes are blue galaxy
I identify as dragon this movie is foreshadowing the future.
I literally can't wait for this film!!!
At 12:08 The four legged  creature clearly looks like an otter....i guess it's Lyla
Hey! just wanted to point of that's not debris in the scene of rocket it looks more like pellets, or like stuffing you would put into a rodents cage. That's what it looks like the most to me. And he's face is a lot smaller n "younger looking"
Nebula & Mantis had better survive, or I will start throwing things!
How are you not aware that literally right this second, we are on the brink of WW3, and closer to nuclear annihilation than we’ve ever been?
They’re wearing RAVAGER garb.
Huh i think that's a colon 👀
The undiscovered Easter egg might not be found yet because this film isn’t out yet and the final part of it is the coordinates on this film
Theyre gonna kill Rocket...  :(
I think the thing they're jumping onto in the colored suits is inside rocket's body, they got shrunk and injected.
Does Noone else remember or realize Nova was destroyed after Vol. 2 attack from Ego?  I expect to see Nova
Drax  Bullets: 😂 Ball: 🤕
That shot of Rocket lying on the ground is most definitely a flashback. His chin and ear hair are shorter, and there are pellets on the ground.
Maybe Maredith was secretly mutant and that mutant gene activated the celestial gene from ego
I think someone in the GOTG group itself will die because the reactions of Peter and Mantis are just too huge for it to be somebody they’re not so close to.
So is it true that None of the Guardians would appear in the Future Avengers Movie?
Did they ever reveal who actually beheaded "Knowhere" in the MCU?
The belt is made of human leather
can't be peter, nebula doesn't bleed, groot doesn't either, too obvious to be rocket, so drax or mantis is gonna die here.
im going to watch this movie at first day no matter if there are school tests or sum shit
Blood drop looks as it could be gold
4:41 Damn! Drax need to relax 💀
This movie looks like another movie that’s more of a filler than part of the bigger story being told by Marvel
The way Poulter described Adam Warlock here sounds like he’s the perfect matchup for Drax, powers aside, but mind-wise 😂😂😅  In the scene with Nebula it looks like he was attacked by nebula and this way discovered physical combat for the first time with a lot of fun 😂
The nodes/valves on the backs of the space suits look a lot like the implants in Rocket's back.
What happened to The Benatar? Why did they get such a huge ship?
This might be the best of the trilogy and I’m hyped for it. And I love that we are seeing the High Evolutionary. I believe him being the main antagonist means that halfworld is his creation and he created it in humanity’s image. And I didn’t even think about the Enclave working for him. That allows the human origin for Adam Warlock to still be in tact as Herbert Wyndham is from Earth and has ties to Adam in the comics. I hope that the Enclave is how the collectors got Adam’s cocoon
Peter was the only one with the light passed on because Ego placed the cancer inside of his mother. ( maybe during pregnancy)
can someone explain how gamora is here/alive
Quill should be on AirPods by now 📱 🎧
I love the Thor films as they are, but imagine if Gunn directing those as well. They'd be far more balanced between the humor and seriousness than they are.   That's the reason Guardians can get away being hilarious, and Thor is touch and go, because the seriousness Gunn incorporates equally compliments the humor. Taiki is more of a comedic director whereas Gunn can do both and intertwine them in a perfect balance.
Did  they buy nowhere from the collector or just claim it after thanos killed him?
5:10 YO THATS TECHNICALLY MORDECAI (but wit 🍒s) 💀
I'm thinking that sceen when Peter is cry shouting, it is mantis projecting a vision and giving Peter a chance to say good bye to his mom.
Still not Peter tackling someone not unless he is going Super Saiyan lol which he does get a power up in the comics
That's a younger Rocket in that scene
Amogus guardians
That's not Peter it's Adam Warlock you can see his skin is yellowish and his eyes are glowing yellow
I can't explain it but I have a feeling that Drax is gonna be the big death of the movie, just because I feel like that's what Dave would wanna do with the character. The next phase of the MCU is looking crazy right off the bat and I'm ready for it
9:15 when i saw this, i thought this looks like ego, rebuilding
How is no one thinking drax will die. Bautista has said he can no longer play the role long term and he is the only one who mentions killing. Which is ironic as he is honestly the most likely to die. Plus the chest wound in the earlier shot
i bet the one that die is drax he is steppin down, the best way is to dyin here
i think DRAX will die in this movie
Really enjoy every piece on content that NR puts out and E Voss to me by far does the greatest presentations. Seems like he practices every video over 1000 times to get his point perfectly across. Great job NewRockstars!
I think Peter's mother is a mutant
So many emotional ups and downs in this huge teaser,  wow,  the next couple of marvel movies look insane.
I think that is a scalpel that the blood is dripping from
The multicolored space suits might be a Teletubi nod. They are different colored baby aliens. Just a thought.
I feel like its pretty clear that Drax is gonna die? Wasnt it revealed that this was the actors last movie as Drax?
I’m ready to cry buckets again
Your videos comes out a little later than the others but have much more depth in the analysis. Great work. Can't wait for this movie.
Draxx gonna die
The mutant Gene in the MCU is probably like cancer is the best example everyone has it just certain people get affected by it sorry for the said example
What made Peter special to egos I think he had the mutant Gene that's why he could handle the celestial power but his Gene has not bloomed that's why he doesn't have any Mutant powers
Lol the HalfWorld is giving Arthur 😂
Manhattan was called Manahatta and it means long hills
Yeh..!!gurdians of the galaxy 1 is perfect...!!👌❤🔥
2:24 the cruise ship really looks like a Disney cruise ship in my opinion
Can't wait for GoG vol 3
heyyyyyyyy Lyla's left arm is mechanical
As hard as it is to think....I believe we will lose Drax
We all know Vin diesel likes saying family   Could it be that when Groot says "We are Groot" it translates to we are family?
Groot said, "Guardians Assemble!!"
Likely losing Scott Lang, Rocket, and Indiana Jones in about a four-month span.  Yay, 2023!  Thanks, Disney!
No no no. Peter standing over that bed crying can't be Lyla. It has to be someone he thinks of as family. Someone he's spent a lot of time with. What if it's a copy/alt version of his mother!
You might be right about the shot of Rocket laying down. The things on the ground might be food pellets
The Bucky arm thing is a big one for me
How did they buy knowehere from the collector?  Though thanos killed him for the stone
What if, Yondue was the one that saved rocket from the scientists/high evolutionary? And that's why he knew stuff about rocket before the audience did and why he was always on his ass about knowing him better than he knew himself! Well it would be the ravengers that saved him, but maybe this was before Yondue got kicked out of the ravengers fer kidnapping/saving Peter Quill.
Peter is a mutant. That’s how he was able to access the celestial powers.  My guess is he will be able to again after the High Evolutionary tinkers with him, the blood dripping is Peters. And that is why Nebula is carrying him into Knowwhere.
Hot on emotions and great on visuals this is gonna be a masterpiece ending for the guardians ❤️❤️
I think that scene with rocket laying in that table ain't him dying, it's him in a flashback and showing who saved him from the high evolutionary. Someone had to save him, whether it be Groot or Groot was another experiment by the high evolutionary and rocket or whoever saves him saves Groot too, but someone had to get him outta there to meet up with peter quill in GotG volume 1.
I think it's drax, he's flinched at a brick, he's been carried out with a blast hole in his chest. I just don't want it to be Rocket. But that "We are Groot" so much pain and love in that scream. It's not going to be a newbie. It's definitely an original guardian he/we lost..
Easter egg could be that Meredith is captain America's daughter and quill has alien DNA and super soldier DNA 😂😂
the disrespect for transformers
I bet Peter quill has not only the celestial gene from his father, but he has the X mutant gene from his mother, and he is a mutant and a celestial!
I thought the. suits were looked like celestials.
Wasn't it rumored for a while that Drax would die in the film?
seriously, Guardian of the Galaxy is one of the most well made Superheroes Movies, The Chemistry, the Comedy, Character, etc. Really love it
I think Rintrah in the MOM was created by high evolutionary too, idk
Why is Mario here
drax will die 100% :(((((
Thanks Ryan!
I think it's Drax. Bautista did say it would be the last time for him due to the physical strains.
I'm really wondering now that if someone is going to die it will be Mantis
i know from the Telltale game that the Otter is going to make people weep
I think Peter is crying for mantis, think about it, Peter just got the only real family member with him, I think mantis will die
The flesh thingy where they were headed to with the coloured space suit could be ego who s regenerating? Thoughts?
WHAT ABOUT TRANSFORMERS
E.VOSS…Volume 1 is also my favorite MCU movie. It was so unexpectedly FANTASTIC!!!!
So Peter finds his Celestial power back from Nowhere to fight warlock?
I enjoy watching the videos in this channel 😁 but I I do dislike that he advertised about stupid b******* it really kills the mood of the video 😠
Watch Meredith Quill end up being the first official mutant revealed in the MCU. Mutants arose from interaction with the cosmic energy emitted from the gestating Celestial egg within the Earth, so it would make sense for Peter to have the ability that no other child Ego had, because he has Celestial input on both sides of his family (directly from Ego, indirectly from Meredith).
Maybe Meredith Quill was a ... Mutant?!?
Maybe Drax's eyes are eyes are more vulnerable than the rest of his body.
I think it's cool that Guardians 1 is your favorite MCU movie, because Guardians 2 is my favorite.
Big things 👀👀👀👀
No , Xander is still there , Thanos whent to the future and was disolved before it happened .
Meredith Quill must be… a mutant!
Such a shame the MCU "shot their load" so early with the Infinity Saga. Had they'd waited, they could have filmed an epic trilogy with ALL of the proper characters and storylines in place... (Adam Warlock, Silver Surfer, Galactus, the Fantastic 4, Infinity etc.)...Snyder cut i guess😂
I know Drax is dying for sure. But there will be 2 deaths. I don't know who's the 2nd
was peters mom a mutant
I think Drax will die in the beginning and then rocket at the end of the film, maybe Adam Warlock kills Drax? hence why Peter tackles that scientist out of the building.
Groot has bulked up.
The peter screaming scene is a flash back of his mother
Rocket gamora and drax are dying is my guess.. and I think Peter is crying over gamora.
Has any marvel movie ever referenced any other planets in the solar system? Other than earth obviously. I’m really curious
I believe Dave Bautista is a great actor, no one realize that. Have you seen "See" of Apple TV? His character is unrecognizable, this one is scary, far from the sweet, idiotic, funny Drax. Someone should recognize his acting talent.
Rocket, Drax, and Mantis are on the chopping block. I don’t think they’ll kill Peter, Groot, Gamora, or Nebula…but hey 🤷🏽‍♂️
I love you guys but sometimes ericks energy is just too much for me.... i want to chill and kick back after work and listen, but ericks energy is too juch for me most days.. chill voss and less exciting frenetic energy
Spiderman Unlimited 1999 High evolutionary (counter earth)
The death will definitely be Drax unfortunately😫
Rocket goes to look for answers and gets recaptured by the High Evolutionary and through there he reconnects with Lilla.
i think nebula is holding quill because mantis put him to sleep
ALSO the four legged figure you see in the background is Cosmo the Dog, who was in the Christmas Special, and is likely to die in their adventures this time around unfortunately.
Maybe it’s Drax, in the comics he does reincarnates a few times
I'm not ready 😭
I think Peter was able to be successful with the celestial gene because he has Captain America’s blood.  Same actress played his “flirty love interest” and Peter’s mom.  Why would they rehire the same actress unless they wanted to indicate they were related?
God I love Mr Sinister's look ever since HoX/PoX, thanks for the reminder that I need to get to the comic store
peter screaming is going to be mantis not rocket I just know it :(
I love the Nova Corps look of the uniforms they're wearing, kind of a mid-series Babylon 5 feel to it.
I assume it is Drax dying on the table because Bautista said he was done with the character. That would also explain why everyone is so upset.
Think rocket, groot and gamora will survive the movie i think Peter,mantis,drax, and maybe nebula will all die
I gasped out loud when I saw Drax knock that kid out in the trailer
Idk why…. But I think it’ll be Mantiss that’s gonna die.
Meredith Quill is a Mutant!!!
15:39, that looks like the agony of someone being operated on without anesthesia, and Peter being a half-celestial and surely someone like the high-evolutionary who likes to experiment on living creatures would be interested in experimenting on Peter as well, which then leads to Nebula carrying Peter.....pin this if I'm correct after the release
I can't wait for this movie 💯💯💯💯💯
RiP Drax....
4:53 nobody remembers my boi Kraglin
Mantis will die. The whole reveal in holiday special is meant to make that official connection so Peter loses all his real family. Rocket will die protecting groot. Oops. Mayne I shouldn't write this.....
All the masculine characters will die as is the trend in the film industry.
Rockets dying. It's so obvious from the trailer.
This is supposed to be David Bautista last GOTG film. I'm pretty sure they kill him off in this film
It kinda looks like a replica of san fransisco
Groot looks so dumb now. I want old Groot back. Volume 1 Groot.
Maybe Rocket told his family that they would fly away together before he escaped.
Drax is going to die not rocket
I am excited and not emotionally ready at all
Im just thinking that the forehead stone of adam was a battery from rocket who was recharged by Power Stone... I just Thinking
Sorry to tell you this but that’s a butthole not an eye socket. This is Guardians of the Galaxy, not Captain America.
I think it’s Drax dying
Did somebody notice  too ?? In that one scene in trailer   were lylla and rocket huging..lylla have robotic arm ?
That shot of star load screaming really scares me
Highly doubt Peter would be screaming like that if it were lylla dying I would say drax or rocket.
I think that 4 legged creature at 12:05 is probably the ottoperson Rocket hugs at 8:08
It would be cool if captain america was related to star-lord
AMOGUS of the galaxy (I don’t care if its 2022)
*(**9:05**)* After seeing that "fleshy" structure, I immediately thought that it kinda resembled a synapse – with some kind of mechanical enhancements integrated into it. Upon deeper consideration of this idea, it would actually be totally plausible to assume that someone called "_The_ _High_ _Evolutionary_"  would have the capabilities and knowledge to create and implement such a technology. It then occurred to me that the reason those suits are entirely different from the ones we've seen them use in space was because perhaps these are specifically designed for traveling in a  microscopic environment! That makes at least a little bit of sense… right?!? 🤔
Rocket is gonna die
Batista is quitting GOTG, so my money on Drax is dieing
So now we’ve gone to super sad emotional marvel movies or just crappy marvel movies true I rather take the former but dang marvel/Disney give the fans a little break here lol. 😅
maybe its mantis because Quill will keep losing family members
My boyfriend just hit me in the head unexpectedly with a French fry and I yelled, "ow! What the hell!" Just to prove that Drax was just caught off guard and not actually hurt by the rock lol
I'm sold on warlock
The floating ones with nodes on their back are like the nodes on ROckets back!
I think Drax is gonna die that's why they gave him the Holiday Special to make everyone appreciate him more
Rocket and Drax gonna die
Everyone in theatre will be cryn so it ok 😿
I think Rocket is gonna get captured and that's why the Guardians are usually without Rocket. 😢
And now I want a baby rocket plush
I think drax is gonna be the one to die in this one
Surely we hear the iconic footloose song this time around🫶🏽 also we not gonna talk about how he hit them notes near perfect at 6:30
Pretty positive drax is gonna die because Dave Bautista has said he’s ready to move on from the character
Quill looks very upset in that scene, it could possibly be gamora again
I agree Rocket looks younger in the shot, he looks more like that ferrety he started as. So I think it’s flashback from the lab.
What happened to peters translator
Not rocket not rocket not rocket not rocket
Looking forward seeing Marvel Studios Marvel Studios Galaxy 3
I’m gonna be so sad if any of them die
do we know who or what killed nowhere ?
RIP Rocket and Draxx
5:10 the bird is a lyrebird you can tell by the boney thing on its forehead
Drax is gonna die; more or less confirmed.
Maybe to leave the High End lab before getting destroyed they need something inside of rocket to open something. And they have no choice.
Drax is 100% going to die in this movie 😕
When the Magus shows up at some point in the MCU shit better hit the fan
probably jus me and my OCD, but the off center stone on Adam Warlocks forehead bothers me ..
don't the settings of these scenes look like the quantum real?
14:31 ooo the enclave, so do they create Adam with Ayesha under the High Evolutionary ?
if they kill rocket I literally will never watch guardians again....that wud be the worst decision he's the best character by miles
The debris around Rocket around 13:40 looks like twigs from Groot. I wonder if it is a flashback to when they met?
This looks amazing!!!
Peters life be like:  Mother died in front of him Groot died in front of him Ego died in front of him Yondu died in front of him Had to kill Gamora in front of him  Who's the next character that will die in front of him
Could the fleshy stuff be related to the cancerverse?
4:36 I swearrrr to god even tho Drax isn’t known for comedic relief, THIS is one of the funniest moments in the whole MCU 😂🤣 I’m dying rewatching it here 😂 Bautista is nailing it
that otter look like the same otter from zootopia😂😂
I think the four legged creature may be brood
Yessss I knew I wasn’t imagining things with Counter Earth I knew it was called that and yeah it’s either that or halfworld or a classic marvel mix of both
I think Drax and Rocket will die
Noooooooooo! Not the sad Michael Scott reference..... 😢 😔
In the Comics, Drax had an Infinity stone on his forehead, Adam Warlock had one AND Vision had one of them too.
The patch on their uniform looks sorta like the raveger patch Yandu has on his clothes and is referenced in vol 2 during the sly stallone scene.
Stop trying to promote Hive, it’s terrible and Twitter isn’t going anywhere.
The arrogance of channels like this is amazing. How the fk do you know what I missed lol.
Um for your #15 easter egg, I think thats just Cosmo lol 😂
8:42 the Power Stone can be The High Evolutionary 😈
I'm not ready for a RocketRacoon death
It could be gamora but I definitely think its rocket
Peter could’ve been able to handle the power because he’s a quarter super soldier. We know the character played by the same actress who played his mom in first avenger was his grandmother and we know Steve lost his virginity on that tour so it’s possible that Steve is peters real grandfather
I believe the scene where rocket is facing death could jus be a flashback, he seems younger compared to the 1 we r seeing now  Flashback could be leadin to his torture or a escape, however I do feel like they will give a very unexpected death possibly drax or gamora again
Is drax one of the people that die cuz batista is done after that movie ?
Yeah I believe the best two mcu films came out the same year in 2014
It's Peter's mother that he is braking down over.
Rocket has always been my favorite MCU character because of the potential he has. But now I’m worried we are seeing all his potential because he’s bout to diiiiiie!
i mean, rocket did have siblings in the animated series
What if peters mom was Spartan or at least half like a runaway princess or some shit
Groot being muscular made me so sad about myself! -incels everywhere 😂
I will so upset if Rocket doesnt say It's Rocking time!
mantis dying might be possible
Guardians Of The Quantum Realm !
I swear this place at 12:46 was in the what if guardians of the galaxy
My money is on Mantis...that wasn't grief, that's pain...and Peter is going to lose the only blood family he has left
Lylla being in it definitely is going to ruin this movie.
I haven't seen the holiday special, but when has Rocket ever called Quill, "Pete?" That surprised me.
Rocket better not die.
18:22 Groot just went full General Grievous
I think rocket is gonna have himself returned back to his original form with everything removed, saying his goodbyes  as he will no longer have his intelligence
Is a love affair between a raccoon and an otter really gonna make me cry. 😢
Ohh noo I think Quill might be operated on by the High Evolutionary 🤔
I really hope Starhawk will appear in this movie. It seems like a lot of Gun's ideas came from the 2008 GotG run.
What if Peter looking at his mom? I mean it’d make sense
Roundabout plays in the beginning while showing the title card of the mixtape
The fact you mentioned that hidden Easter egg that has yet to be discovered and then at the 3nd mention something secretive coming soon for the channel involving guardians of the galaxy... you think you found that hidden secret easter egg huh? Gonna do a live stream about it?
I think Rocket does die in this one, in the "I come in peace" moment in the  trailer...no Rocket.
Marvel are great at deception with their trailers, can't see them giving away rockets death.
I think peter scream of pain, maybe someone try to do a surgery somekind of experiment on him.
cosmo sounds like BMO from adventure time
I’m assuming the scene of quill screaming is rocket being killed by the high evolutionary, which is the scene with the scalpel
They really gave the High Evolutionary a close-up "insane eyes" anime styled shot in the trailer XDD
5:24 oh he’s a rabbit? I thought he was a goat
The Guardians have 2 ships
Based off the guardians and the galaxy cartoon I assume lylla gonna not mak3 it
I think Drax is gonna die
Drax is gonna die
I believe Drax will be the big death.
If Wastlanders is cannon then Peter and Rocket are the only surviving members of the GOTG
I think we'll lose Mantis. I guess that's the reason why we were told about Peter and Mantis family connection.
I really feel like Peter screaming is the death scene of drax while he's in the Bowie's sick bay after he got shot
i think the thing/person Quill was screaming about was mantis. Could make sense because they just told us they’re related.   i know mantis plays a role with kang but i doubt thatll happen
did you just copy the screen crush video bit for bit?
I'm pretty sure Rocket says Fur-ever.
I don’t think this is the last of the Guardians of the Galaxy but simply the end of this trilogy/line up. But I’m 100% betting there will be a Guardians of the Galaxy 4 in some way
Shibby
I think the possible death is Drax.  I’ll check back in 6 months. 😁  But no one is ever officially dead unless you see the body, right?
Maybe drax does because we see in a shot that drax has a hole in his chest so gamora  and nebula help him up
Peter Quill is captain America's grandson
I think Mantis will die.
Drax is the one who's going to die since he said he's done playing Drax after GOTG
Kenny's getting paid this time. 🤣
The next Guardians team could be: Starlord, Mantis, Adam Warlock, Cosmo, Groot and maybe Rocket. Phy-la Vell would be the newcomer.
Rocket is so dead😭
The suits reminded me of Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band
All I see is Kenny not adom lol
Hey Voss. are you sure the dial tone inspired the repeated vocal riff you attempted? Because the original mix of this song featured what sounds like a sampled busy signal (a what? 😜) at the beginning and audible at various points throughout. It's probably not even included in the mix used in this trailer. This is very likely the aspect of the song that was inspired by the dial tone.
Drax death would be sad
I think Drax and nebula are going to die, it’s too obvious for rocket.
Spiderman did animal world in the 1970s cartoon
12:10 I think I know who missing in that part, Adam Warlock.
It's my favorite marvel movie too! It's just so good as it's own stand alone movie
I think there's a couple of possibilities. One, the high evolutionary is aware of mantis and peters celestial genetics and is experimenting on them, probably mantis. Or they find gamora there and mantis is feeling peters pain. Those would be my guesses.
RIght on time for dinner!
Peter screaming and Mantis crying really sold me on how stellar this flick is gonna be ❤️
How is Gamora alive???
11:40 i believe that mantis put peter to sleep for some reason
This movie looks amazing!!! I can’t wait
If this is the best one yet Guardians would definitely be the best trilogy and franchise in the MCU.
So basically they visited the beastars world
I wonder if the fleshy planet could be the remains of ego. Like they need egos help to defeat the high evolutionary
At 5:35 is Chris chan
Would be a good time to drop Nova in the mix. In this movie at the end..
This movie won’t be released until May! Let that sink in…
I feel like it’s gonna be Drax that’s going to die in this movie and rocket will be severely injured and scared up so cybernetics might come into play with rocket because he’s always had an obsession and given that the high evolutionary is there he might take him prisoner and torture him so the guardians have to try and break him out with that’s  my prediction
i figure Peter is getting operated on in that blood drip scene.
Easter egg = quills grandfather is Steve rodgers
Drax, I believe Drax is going to die or Mantis
All I needed to see was them in their classic suits
Plssssss
Do the transformers trailer
the anus portal 😂
I don't think I can handle the death of one of the guardians 🥲
Someone want to tell me what happened to the second ship they had? Why do we now have the bowie?
David Bowie is also a considered a mutant in the comics now.
Rocket for sure gonna die like in the comics
The mcu is ruined but there is potential to still redeem itself by movies like this one
Is this kicking of phase 5
I think Drax is the one that's going to die.
I feel Drax is going to die
I think Drax may be the one to die because I vaguely remember an interview from a long while back where Batista was talking about playing drax and getting older. Anyone else remember that?
I bet Nebula will die
What if they are inside of Rocket. In those colorful spacesuits
Drax died
I'm confused, so the groot we've been watching this whole time isn't the same groot just reincarnated?
Naidoo nahdah!! Cracks me up ever time i hear it
It's drax. Batista did say this would be his last movie
So I'm not the only one who thinks their suits looks like among us characters
Great Michael Scott compassion
Oh, furry’s were a species made by a geneticist in the MCU? God damn!
If they kill Rocket I will start a riot I swear
I thought Gunn said the Bowie was 4 stories and I’d like to know what Quill means by “we’ve been gone a long time” because it obviously can’t mean to him what it does to us?
I’m ready to see this.
Kraglin Obfonteri will die. 100% you don't see him in much of the footage
I think first and foremost...Gamora will die. Might be a sacrifice to save the Galaxy or whatever but bottom line is that Gamora does not belong in this timeline, that will correct itself. My next guess would be Rocket...or possibly both of them. Rocket said he doesn't have a long lifespan and he lived those 5 years during the snap.
DC is so lucky to be getting Gunn. I'm excited to see what he does over there going forward, but definitely bummed this will be the last thing he does in the mcu. He's definitely been one of their best director picks.
Who do you guys think is going to die in this film?
I'm excited for this movie, but after watching this trailer a few times, especially the emotional grief of Peter and Mantis, I think the one who is going to die...is Drax.
I think Drax is gonna die in the movie, Dave Bautista has said previously before that GOTG3 would be his last movie as Drax
Could the fleshy structure be Ego in some form?
Fan prediction here... they'll play the song 'How Deep is Your Love' by the Bee Gees whenever Rocket and Lylla reconnect. Could be true for Peter and Gamora, but seems more fitting with Rocket's arc.
I don't recall any type of Nuclear scare in the 80's, at least, not to the level of the Cuban Missile Crisis of the 1960's.
Really psyched to see this but don’t want to lose any of the Guardians! 😢
If They don't stop killing off characters I'm done with mcu
I believe Drax is dying. Dave Bautista has said he's done playing Drax
Check out the Video for the Gorillaz song “Strange Timez” I see some Inspo
Back to back emotional MCU movies, marvel why 😭😭😭
I won’t be there at comic con but will it be recorded so we can still be involved
I believe this movie will explain why Rocket likes taking people's prosthetics for fun
What if Howard the duck is from half world
Groot’s face is unsettling
I really hope they do 5 years David Bowie and do something about the 5 years snap shift and Gamora
Nowhere is dead and missing a brain 🧠  Ego is a floating brain 🧠  Is Nowhere really ego's body?
This movie gonna BREAK me
Dave bautista said he doesnt really want to continue or something like that, so its probably drax
Will the Guardians ever get nova?
15:38 To me it seems like the tube is going into Peter himself, like an operation or even torture, and his agony is actually pain.
I’m really excited for this movie. I think it’s going to be interesting. Learning more about rockets past.
That fleshy portal is definitely Knowwhere's asshole...thats it. Thats my hot take.
Why is gamora?
The whole phase 5 is gonna be phase cry 😢
I think Quill is mourning over a dead Gamora.
Y’all do a great job. Your success is well deserved.  Keep combing through the frames and we’ll keep tuning in ✌🏽
They’re going to kill rocket. This trailer out too much emphasis on his back story. I’m crying now
Idk why everyone keeps saying and posting Rocket is gonna die in Vol. 3, it’s clearly Drax bc Dave said after the 3rd movie he’s done with Drax and all of it  Now who knows if this is actually true bc actors like to say they’re done playing a certain character (Mr. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart) do many “certain” reasons bc that’s they’re TRUE job
Here me out. So the Enclave create Adam Warlock for the Sovereign and his first mission is to destroy the guardians and retrieve rocket because the High E used a super experimental procedure for intelligence enhancement on Rocket and needs his body to recreate the results for his other experiments.
Who would a thought these obscure characters were going to become the most popular in the MCU
Mcu X Beastars
3:25 Wyndham is also a known associate of Professor Miles Warren aka the Jackal and Jonathan Drew Jessica Drew'/Spider-Womans English father.
Not seeing rocket come out of the Bowie with the rest makes me think he's dead and that part is the end of the film
What song is playing in the background on this video?
(Gunn picking the oldest about to retire actors Possible)
I hope Groot is hiding Rocket inside him like the comics
Think drax going to be kill of Bautista last movie
Celestials. I’ll say it again. Eternals and Guardians will meet like Thor and Guardians did in Infinity War.  I know it.
Wait it’s counter earth not alternate earth I feel like a fool
What if the colors of the suits match their personality.
I wonder if Adam Warlock will be like a former eternal body or something related to the eternals
Since Bautista is out after this one, we're all assuming Drax will die, right?
I love Dave Batista. I really hope we get more Drax in the future.
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Could that Quill screaming scene be him waking up with a tube in him and the High Evolutionary experimenting on him because of his Celestial genetics?
Have a amazing day
I think if there's going to be a death in the movie, it's going to be Drax. I seem to remember Dave Bautista saying he has no interest in continuing to play Drax and wanted Gunn to kill him off in the third one. But if it's not Drax, I think it being Rocket would be the kind of emotional kick in the groin Gunn would give us.
Marvels really going to have us crying over the death of a CGI raccoon
I’m not so sure quill would have such a strong reaction if it were Lylla dying…
Half world is like a parody of island of lost souls
Yo
14:02 In the newish GOTG game rocket has a skin wear he’s wearing a costume and the bio says that he would tell the other animals about a hero that would save them
I really hope they don't kill rocket because he is my favorite
I think that last scene of the trailer is basically the writers tellin us they are gonna kill someone who no one loves in the movie
Pretty sure that the translation collar on Cosmo is the same technology as Doug has in Up (little Disney universe Easter egg)
are you going to break down Transformers?
Meredith is captain America relative .... Super soldier+celestial..... Yahtzee
@6:06 Exactly! That's what I asked in the Breakroom last night.
I thought drax had sensitive nips..
Might be the first marvel movie to make me cry
The Bowie looks a little like the Gunstar from the Last Starfighter.
I hope that the trailer is just making us believe rocket may die. I can't lose him. I also don't want him to die and then be replaced with Lylla either
Surely Mantis is gonna die. Quill screaming like that for an otter he just met makes no sense but losing his half sister that he just learnt about, his last living family member as far as he knows, after losing Gamora, Meridith and Yondu would rip his heart out
Never realised their ship was so big
Let's hope Mantis don't die
I think the fleshy thing they’re on is remnants of Ego or what is now Super-Ego. It looks more like the innards of Ego and the white backdrop looks a lot like Ego’s egg ship or what Ego used for the displays of the story of how he met Peter’s mom
Kraglin and Drax are gonna die.
Drax will die. David Bautista asked for his character to die. He doesn't want to do it anymore
Those shots in what seems like the prison, where they're in orange jumpsuits with the white background, looks like the same material as Ego's ship and "egg dioramas." That fits nicely with the idea of that place being part of an actual Celestial's body.
Dammit voss y u gotta b a tease now i gotta know what ur so excited about lmfaoo
Ego gave Peter's mom cancer, which is considered a mutation. Maybe Peter is a mutant.
I think rokket will survive and draw will die
Rocket is definitely serious as he calls him "Pete". Its always been Quill
Lylla's got a robot arm! is this why Rocket's obsessed with cybernetic limbs?
I'll bet it's Lyla that we see in the background walking with the Guardians.
This looks like a emotion and exciting ride and i can't wait.
I'm not ready to say goodbye to GOTG but I have so much love and respect for what Gunn has given us.
I am expecting Drax to die since Bautista doesn't want to play the character anymore.
The High Evolutionary’s armour looks a little like Kang’s 👀
I’m not ready for this level of emotional turmoil 😅 literally first scene of wakanda I was in tears 🤦‍♀️
Good harmony lol
They could be forcing through the actual eyeball lining and that fleshy deal is the optic nerve??? A celestial eyeball would be a pretty cool evil lair. 😈
What thor love and thunder should of been, a heart felt movie with love and passion with alittle a tiny comedy
if u saw closely you would see the giant alien from the beginning of vol 2!
13:26 when I first saw this trailer, I thought that scene was Rocket near death or something, but I realize now this might actually be Rocket talking to Lylla before they got separated.
Don't know about any Lyllas. I see Hana the otter.
scalple. bye mantis D;:
meredith was a mutant and they will say that in gotg3?🫣
Drax is getting the axe, guys. This is Dave Bautista's last marvel movie
Would be interesting if it was the Enclave that made Yondu's fin 🤔
Drax is gonna die. Last I head Dave was done with the franchise, and he didnt renew contract.
This is a very sad trailer! Its like theyre all saying goodbye 😢😢😢
Hi!
The multicolor space suits are used for when they get shrunk down and they land on Rocket. They are landing next to one of his cybernetic ports or whatever.
My money is Drax not making it through.  But ... As his eternal nemesis... If Thanos ends up coming back around we might get a Drax resurrection.
I am both excited and devastated that this will be the last movie with the GOTG
I’m so hyped for this movie! 😊
I hope we see Alpha/King Groot.
Reeeeeaallly wished I watched the holiday special before this.. 😂
Im pretty hyped for this movie, especially the back stories
How'd you talk about the uniform and not mention the, what looks like, a Raveger emblem.
i feel like Gamora's going to die again. I dunno, something about the interview I read about Zoe Saldana being 'artistically stuck' when doing franchise films.
I wonder if counter Earth will be involved in secret wars it has to be a possibility because it's on the other side of the Sun
This movie is gonna hit hard emotionally because we love these characters and don’t want to see them go
IM GONNA CRY THE WHOLE MOVIE
Thank you guys for everything you do!!!!!
First the Mario trailer 2, then indie, gotg, AND transformers in one day? What an incredible time for cinema!
I suspect HE is gonna test on Peter's Celestial Gene, but he might live through it.
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
bell gang
I AM GROOT!!
early here
This movie looks like it's gonna bring tears to my eyes.
I'm ready for this movie!!
Gatdaym this trailer is so freaking cool
