A year later, I enjoyed watching the video and reading the comments. I am grateful to the editors of Time magazine for the right choice! Why hasn't Taylor been awarded the Nobel and Pulitzer Prizes for her brilliant lyrics? It's already 2025, dear academics, the time has come!  Especially after TTPD...
She's an icon ❤
Looks viutifo veive I like ❤

Person of the Year and very soon Person of the Century! Go TS!
i've been a Swiftie since 2008. Her music has gotten me through my mother's passing, breakups, hardships.  She is my superhero. I can't think of anyone more deserving of person of the year. I love you Taylor ❤
Taylor Swift is a giver and an earner who contributes to every community that she enters.
❤
Well deserved, Brava!!!
Директор ЦРУ Уильям Бернс тайно встретился в Кабуле с лидером «Талибана» 24.08.2021 конец истории и дружбы
That security guard is so cute omg I hope he gets to see her as an audience member so he can fully experience and enjoy the show!!!
She's too much. The media covers her too much. She keeps breaking up w men. I'm sure this football player is just another boyfriend. I wonder if she will marry. 🌷🌷
В Российской культуре нет любви как мама сказала так и сделаем женишься и детей и все
hate her or not you can't deny that she's an idol and a very powerful person in this generation
I mean, with all the CO2 and stuff…
And TIMES person of the year 1938 was.....
That security guard, i am so so so happy for him. He is so happy and i love that
Alexei Navalny should be the person of the year 2024!
If a man made a music video of a woman squatting and pissing in a public place like the subway he’d be labelled a vulgar misogynist who makes degrading videos about women. If Taylor Swift makes a video of a man pissing in a subway Time Magazine will label her “Person of the Year.”
Where's her broom?
👑Taylor Swift 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Taylor Swift deserves Person Of The Year Honors and for the Recognition for her entire life👏👏👏👏👏
🎉🙌🌟👍💫👏✨🎉
Taylor Swift is George Soro's puppet.
Sooooo she just became this version of Joni Mitchel and bjork
This is hypocritical since she continues to harrass Kim kardashian she promotes hate and revenge towards Kanye west as she fueled this decade drama, it’s all manipulation like a dictator, but I’m grateful for the gentle souls who can listen to her music and not fall victim to the hate
I understand she arranged some musical notes and words in a certain order that speaks to alot of young people, however. I think person of the year could have easily gone to any one of the soldiers who died in the ukraine, thrust into a war and defending your homeland without choice. Thats an easy pick for me
Idk why this made me emotional during the security guard story
Love Tay Tay ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
Much Deserved!
Excellent choice! Taylor is incredibly beautiful, talented and gifted!

Wow.
This is fascinating because I'm way out of her fanbase demographic. Generally I think of political leaders who win office as candidates for this. Like they gave it to Hitler in 1938 and Stalin in 1942.  She had a better year than Zelensky of Ukraine and it was a year that ended in traumatization of the Israeli and then the Palestinian, after the Russian and the Ukrainian.  Performers are important. Pray to their patron saint, St Vitus.
It would be believable if that woman was actually Taylor Swift. The mainstream media and corrupt powers that be have complete control over the entire entertainment industry and when the public discover they have been brainwashed and played since they were born, the shit is going to hit the fan.
Myyy momsss my love
OMG, I'm soooo touched by this video!!! I'm turning into Swiftie after watching the Eras Tour movie, twice!
My Hope to overcome this MAGA shit
Taylor Swift will defeat Donald Trump singlehandedly.
It’s amazing that you people think that this woman did this all herself. But she didn’t have a wealthy father with connections to the music industry. If they planned out a career for her. That other people handle her finances and the decisions are made by people who have been educated in finance. And on and on and on. This woman never spent one day at a college business course. Yet you all believe she’s the greatest business genius on earth. Let’s not get into the songs…
Time magazine has been going downhill for decades. How’s the last hit rock bottom.
Love her!
We desperately want the cat cover and copy but cannot buy it anywhere as they are all sold out. Please make more!
I love you Taylor so much I really want to go to one of your tours so bad I would be so happy to see you plz reply soon love you.😆
She is the mother who takes care of all of us.
REALLY?! Not the ISRAELI Prime Minister? What's happened in the mid-east has far far more reaching consequences world wide than a pop star. lol.
This is such a pathetic choice for person of the year. Dissapointed
Way to go Taylor, suck Kanye, her music beats rap crap, any day.
Really lowered the bar
My favorite Taylor Swift Time cover is the one with the cat
It been torture having to see the same dude’s mug on so many magazines wherever I’m checking out.  Year after year after year after year…same dude same dude same dude same dude. It’s so dreadfully lame.
🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸
92% ⛳
She is a great business woman a03su&screenHeight
I'm happy for Taylor, but I really believe the Palestinian people of Gaza should've been on the cover. Peace.
She's always been the right person.  This fact plays a crucial role in making people love her.
Sam Altman should be the person of the year, not this semi naked idiot who dances like gorilla and have no impact on the world at all,
Why did they choose the worst pictures of her
So I cried watching this because its just sooooo touching how Taylor made an impact in our lives. She doesnt know me personally but she was a friend who was there at my highest highs and my lowest lows.
Taylor is a person in every sense of the word: unique, humane, and generous.
Most oppressed by men in the music industry. Smh. Different words used for men vs women. She is liar
I wasn't a Taylor Swift fan really until this year. I knew in the past I heard things, people talking bad about her.. making fun of her music, writing , relationships ect. and I wasn't really listening.   I just remember thinking to myself .. jeez.. she couldn't be THAT bad why are people so mean to her?? so fast forward to 2023 and I now I understand....  the Swifties😃🥰. I am proud to say I am one!  She really is the songwriter of our generation and such a  sweet, real person !!  I believe after all the crap in the past,  she is getting the recognition she deserves . I am beyond proud of her and will forever be a Taylor Swift Fan!!!  there have been so many times I have laughed, screamed and cried from something related to Taylor!  and OMG.. the Kelce situation??? I am loving that for her as well. I feel she has finally showed them all and being Times person of the year just seals the deal!!  Way to go Taylor!🥰😉😶‍🌫
THANK YOU TAYLOR! I COULDN'T CARE LESS FOR YOUR MUSIC OR PERFORMANCE (WHICH ARE GREAT BTW) I CARE HOW YOU HAVE STOOD UP AGAINST TRAITOR TRUMP AND HIS TREASONOUS TRUMPISTS! THANK YOU.
Songs are 100% written by AI
Foolish women freee palestine
She does t deserve to be person of the year
Free palestine
Free palestine
Free palestine
Thank you Taylor!! <3
The proposal section has me CRYING ❤
Happy for her
Swift is the only famous person I've ever seen in my life and I literally could never name a song of hers. She's so un-influential in my sphere of perception that she's just not important at all.  Good for her though, and good for everyone else too. Im glad music makes you happy.
What!?  The girls don't even make their own bracelets?, they buy them on Etsy?  Fake ass bullshit
Love taylor💖❣️♥️❤️
Thus video made me cry 😭
Her music gives me great motivation and light up my world. I actually love her😘
I just don't get it?
Congratulations  so happy they picked you,
Taylor Swift is the best female singer I have ever seen and heard. She turned from a country staple to a global phenomenon ever taking a billion dollars, according to Bloomberg. I have never seen Swift in person, but I am a Swiftie because her Eras Tour concert movie became a smash hit in October. I am so proud of her becoming the first woman on the cover of TIME. This is a wonderful day to start Christmas.
Love this ❤️
Who was Time's man of the year in 1938 and 1939? Would you like to tell us? Hint: They both had mustaches.
Amazing that’s Taylor 🩷🩷🩷
🌟 🌟 🌟🌟 🌟Happy birthday, Taylor Swift 🎂 🥳 🎉 🎈 🎁 🎊🌟 🌟🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟🌟 🌟

making a better world , especially for thirteen-year-old girls.
Next time you need help, please let me know.
ED Sheeran is iconic,better than the overrated Woman
Horribel
My daughters (20 and 15) absolutely love her. They have their tickets for Dublin 2024 and cant wait. I actually enjoy her music now as well as its always on in teh car - so much so that my spotify profile came in the top 1% of people to listen to he rin 2023 - had to laugh. Keep inspiring young people around the world. A light in the grimmy and fdark entertainment world.
😭❤️❤️❤️✨
Omg !!! ✨❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
wow massive news , I’m heading to the toilet to have a huge shit
RIDICULOUS! World's gone stupid mad!
Happy Birthday Madame, Love from Mumbai, India
AUDIO INTERVIEW * TAYLOR + TIME MAGAZINE -->> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TpbMIX8pNs
She doesn’t so much “sway” the “social currents …predominantly female audiences “ as she empowers them to use their voices and act on their values - yes! Taylor I love watching you be YOU!  ❤👏🥰👍 (Greetings from a female fan in her 60’s!💃🏻😁)
I guess Time mistaking this overrated bag of crap for a human being, and then deciding it’s the best human of the year isn’t any more surprising than choosing a man as woman of the year.   Or sleazy corporate propaganda rags like Time and CNN mistaking themselves for news outlets.
she is a #forceofnature
Well deserved! Intelligent,  changed everything about the movie industry. Helping the economy,  got our youth, middle age male and female moving toward unity, moving, singing and dancing. All positive growth. She is a natural and super caring human being! Down to earth. Loveya girl!
I'm so proud of her and truly happy for her the way she made me the happiest this year ❤️
I don't know why but i cried the whole video
If I were a big star like taylor, I would do a free concert for all of the security guards and other employees who worked at but weren't allowed to watch the concert. Idk how that would logistically work, but I'd try. Man that would be awful for a big fan. Knowing Taylor is RIGHT behind you, but you absolutely can not turn around and look.
I didn’t know the girl was a child of someone famous that makes sense now😮😂❤
You could probably make those at home for $5-10 plus I’ll probably make them out of leather and metal plaques they’ll look pretty that way in my opinion
Happy birthday queen ❤️❤️❤️
Hi,good job
This is now her REPUTATION 👏👏👏
Our latest video on Taylor is out! Check it out! 💥💢 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TeSMyiOofc&t=3s  10 SHOCKS in 2023 making Taylor Swift THE most successful singer EVER💓💓💓
My name is Kanye, I want to say that Jerome Powells  influence is 100 million times bigger than that of Taylor Swift. His aggressive interest rates hikes is felt by corporates and homeowners alike all over the world.  No other person in 2023 has this direct impact on so many humans.
She recently became a member of the Illuminati that's why everything she does is headline storie, as we can all see,
I love this person. Taylor Swift concerts have like the highest concentration of happy people it really is amazing.
😒seriously she got chosen over Sam Altman
She deserves the world,the moon and the stars! We love you Taylor❤
❤
She is absolutely amazing and deserves every bit of this ❤
The way I started crying at the proposals💛
Just imagine the world if Dr. Vandana Shiva was on Time magazine as person of the Year or another environmental scientist or soil/regenerative ag scientist, the real heroes. Now that would be something. I am so glad I discontinued it a long time ago. It now has become today's Disney in magazine form, it seems. The last Time magazine I purchased, full price from a magazine stand, was about the bees. It was a spread of about 10-12 articles, the plight of the bees to the development of robot bees. You might want to check that issue out. Bees on the cover.
Let's be honest: She wouldn't get this much attention if the media wasn't on her neck since 2008. She had to bring the best in her every time the odds were up. So to make you haters  feel better: this truly all started with the media's obsession with TS' personal life, not particularly her "humanitarian contributions", so you all played yourselves thinking she doesn't deserve it 😆   Even if the media ignored her, Taylor would still be doing her own thing and have the same connection with her fans.
That was just for magazine sales, get it.
Bracelets and hats. Wow. This is the best we can do?
So let me understand what you people are saying. Taylor Swift was named person of the year because of her concert tour, because of friendship bracelets, because of hats, because she is relatable and because she expresses feelings.  Really?  The whole world is ready to blow itself up and this is the person you name person of the year because she is a good distraction from the reality of life in America which is that America is dying.  If that is the case I'm sure you would agree that the passengers of the Titanic voyage were the musicians that dutifully played while the ship was sinking to help the people better face their inevitable destruction.  Honestly, if Taylor Swift is the person of the year than America has absolutely no hope of survival.  I think whoever made this decision is so out of touch with reality that it is disturbing. Are all of you people really this stupid? Or maybe you realize that you're in a hopeless situation with no way to survive.  I also find it disturbing to see human beings idolizing other human beings in such a way. You people will be wanting to deify her next and ready to crucify anyone who disagrees. But if Taylor Swift who is a human being just like all other human beings is being deified by you people what does that say about you? If she is god what does that make all of you?  She doesn't know any of you. She's selling songs. She's a song seller. You've declared a song seller as the person of the year? And none of you understand how absolutely pathetic that is?  I feel sorry for all of you.  I mean if she came up with a World Peace Plan or if she solved World Hunger or if she cured some major disease or if she did anything at all that has any positive lasting change on the World at all than I would be able to agree with you.  Don't you dummies understand that all she is doing is selling songs for money? Does that qualify her to be the person of the year? If so than the World is a pitiable place indeed.
Taylor Swift is a modern-day Princess Diana 💞🥰💞🥰
Go Taylor Go! - We all stand behind you!
IT SHOULD BE MOTAZ. Or any of the journalists risking their lives to show the truth in Gaza!!!
In this world of depression, she came up with her joy her passion and hard working. Her commitment and dedication to her music and her fans is awesome. She enlightened millions of lifes. Taylor Alison Swift is a living legend. Thank you for making this world a better place
Taylor has been the shining light that we have needed through this dark TIME! We love you Taylor! Thank you for all that you do!
lol..Of all people. She sings in her underwear.
Beautiful, talented, and a great person. NOT person of the year though... That belonged to GRETA - you missed a golden opportunity here. Or is it just that the voters want to hold their "wealth"
I mean, she seems lovely, and i wish her all the best. However, for all the nurses, doctors on the front lines of covid, for all the firefighters, cops and EMTs trying to keep society from falling apart barely making a living. For the good teachers out there spending their own money on school supplies for poor kids, for the social workers, for the soldiers who fought and died to keep 9/11 from happening again, for the real diplomats trying to maintain peace in a world on fire this is such a slap in the face and illustrates how elitist and out of touch Time is.
Congrats Tay Sway
The fact that people here are actually saying she deserves it is killing me. The person of the year should have gone to someone who has contributed or made a huge role in the world for the year and not to some crappy celebrity who "inspires people with her music." I'm not hater nor lover but TIME giving these awards randomly based on popularity and celebrity status is based af.  To think again, Hitler was given the same award, and Trump was given it too. This year's a waste too. No hate to her but she simply does not deserve this award. Anyone who considers so, grow up.
Go Taylor go!! We are here for all of it!! 👏🏻💃💜
I had no idea any of this existed and it’s amazing. ❤
My daughter discovered her on YouTube when she was about 11 and I guess Taylor was 14. Daughter is also a musician, now teaching high-school chorus and private voice lessons and singing with numerous professional choral groups. It’s so wonderful to see a young woman who has succeeded so brilliantly doing things her own way. Taylor is no one’s victim.
Truthfully, at first I thought it was too much, like she wasn’t that big but the more I thought about it, I see how Taylor can be and should be Person of the Year! With our children being the most important for our future, Taylor Swift is a true mentor/role model/a child’s ambassador/any age woman’s gurl. She’s a fitting role model for all ages and that’s to be admired ! So I am glad she represents the Americana standards…Person of the Year! She’s kept it real, and really, we don’t see that anymore, with the exception of TS, I’d like to thank her for staying true to herself.
Person of the year for Taylor Swift? Yes she is goldfish for those who get fat pockets from her concerts. Something tell that the same people are involved in Person of the year contest. Hype for the money is going on. Of course she is great artist
Crap.. Just to sell your magazine.. Too bad Beyonce is not white
I love Tay but I have to blocked her music in Spotify, it seams like she is everywhere I think 2023 was a lot of her, she was overused…
Why? Why am I tearing up? I've been a Swiftie since her first album. I'm soooo happy for her. I wish she can have a concert here in the Philippines once again, somedayyyy :)
She is a force to be reckoned with.
Taylor swift for President. Enough of trump.
Congratulations Taylor, I’m happy for you! Carry on!
In addition to reclaiming her music catalog by re-recording her early albums she wielded her power to distribute her concert film directly to theaters bypassing the production companies.
This YEAR? Uhm, excuse me but that light's been shining so bright, publicly, for about 17 years.  [[SEVENTEEN YEARS]] 🫶
mid af
Well Deserved Such a Beautiful Human being ..THOSE are the people that should Grace your cover
HIGHLY  LOVE AND  RESPECT  TAYLOR  SWIFT ❤️ 💕 ❤️‍🔥💖💯🤘🇺🇸🫂
GREAT CHOICE TIME! This was right!!!! Taylor deserves this! Thank you Taylor for your light!
She must be proud. Now she and Hitler have something in common.
Taylor Swift Congratulations Girl🌺!!! Well Deserved… She is A clear example of Hardwork and Grace
The media plan is to make her person of the year and push her videos, then do a massive campaign to get Democrats to vote for the 2024 election, along side the release of the Donald Trump movie that will roast him, which will get tons of support from left wing mainstream media
SHE'S EVERYTHING.
WOKE magazine of the year.
Well deserved Taylor. America now go vote and get the Maga lunatics out!
why
this is laughable.
Why ? Do not get it. 😩
She's a  C u next tuesday!
I don’t like her music she’s overrated I can’t with this 😭😭 but this is so sweet
Thank you so much Time for doing this. Taylor absolutely deserves this so much.
Sadly this accolade has been tarnished by her endless crying about Kim K and Kanye.  STOP TALKING ABOUT IT. She gave them her space within Time by actually saying saying the names. Now, this magazine will have Kims name with Taylor's FOREVER. Was this calculated?  I don't know but Taylor needs to focus on HERSELF and leave the past in the past. Also, her comment about trash taking it's self out was super uncalled for even if you do not like Kim K, which I dont really care for her, that is shitty to say.  Taylor lost a point by speaking of this and continuing to make this a "narrative" she so publicly wanted to NOT be a part of.
Way to go , It's certainly has been a miraculous year, congratulations..
You robbed Journalist of Gaza ... ashamed of your hypocrisy
Congratulations to Taylor Swift.  Well earned. Well deserved.
HOW COULD YOU NOT LOVE HER
She's just so iconic
SHE IS SO FREAKING ICONIC OH MY GOSH
Good for her. Like what's She's done outside of music but Swift is not my person of the year. She's overexposed and shoved down our throats in my opinion
Well deserved!!!💖💖💖 Congratulations to Taylor Swift!💖💖
everything about this is so superficial it hurts 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 there is no way that 2023 was this dull !! absolutely disappointing.
BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA WHAT A JOKE . NO WONDER I HAVEN’T READ THIS RAG IN 25 YEARS !
Taylor❤🙏👑🎤🎤🎤
adoration is dangerous for the adorer but even more dangerous for the adored .
Man, she is on top!!! Super talented and a great role model for our youth as well. Thank you, Taylor for leading by example and rocking it!!!   I love the way she isn’t responding to the MAGA attacks on her, such class!!!!
Pathetic. We can do better.
person of the year Abu Obaida person of the year Abu Obaida person of the year Abu Obaida 🇵🇸🇧🇩
I'm not crying at those proposals, you're crying!
So proud to be a Swiftie ❤
She has brought a light into the world…She has helped brought me, my mom, and 5yr old closer.🤩
This is too ridiculous 😂
i thought there was an easter egg from the italicized letters at 2:06 🤣🤣🤣
What a terrible choice. How does mediocre music and banging a football player make you influential?
Congratulations Taylor Swift!
I am so glad she lashed out the man of the year 😀
Most streamed female artist in Apple Music history? So she’s not the most streamed artist in their history?? I wonder who is? Drake maybe?
🇵🇸
CONGRATS TAYLOR!!!
You should have chose Putin and watch the swifties hunt down Putin and end the Russia/Ucrânia war. Missed opportunity
Person of the year, who decides? just america. good god
SHE IS MY GIRL !!!!!!!!!  I've ALWAYS been SOOOOOO PROUD to be the biggest swifty EVEEEERRR in the planet!!!!! FROM THE BEGINING TILL THE END and more !!!! I have always known that she will be at the top in the whole world and she proved it ! MY HEART FILLED LOVE FOR THE ONE AND ONLY person who is, were and always will be deep inside my heart and soul... TAYLOR SWIFT! I LOVE YOU SO SO SO MUCH TAYLOR !!!!
GOOSEBUMPS. LITERAL GOOSEBUMPS
where is the attention for Gaza?
just pure capitalism, and during a televised tax-payer-funded genocide. there is a shame carried by every soul who ignores Palestinian voices and their extermination, especially when they're against the occupation of Ukraine, only caring when it suits them and their colonial perceptions
I honestly don’t know who else they could have picked, the Eras tours affected our local and National economies and is now on to affecting the global economy with each stop. Very few artists can say that. And 44 songs a night over 3 hrs with no breaks is insanely impressive.
Good for her.
Thank you Time!
I became her fan after I saw Eras Tour movie 😍
She is phenomenal. That is all.
She borrows heavily from black culture yet they make it seem like she has created her own lilly white lane.
Nobody c Ares
Well deserved, Tyler!!!! I’m so impressed with her positive influence, not trying to get new voters to vote for either side, but jyst to REGISTRR & VOTE!!!! What a great role model!!!
Calvin watched the concert through the eyes of Swifties and I love that he felt the magic through them. Wishing him the best and I'm sure he'll get to watch her perform one day!!
🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶
Got to love that brood mother
CNN is all mad cause a real woman got person of the year and not the fake ones. Congratz to Taylor Swift, GOD has blessed her with amazing talent, to bad she's a socialist.
Why am I two minutes in and just watching how someone makes money off Taylor Swift?
I was never a fan of her music and I do not consider myself a fan but I love her for all the good she has done and will do. IMO she does deserve this honor hands down. She does a lot for charity IMO she really cares for the organizations she donates to etc.
absolutely sobbing
When Trump puts on his orange jumpsuit, that would be worthy of a Time cover.
Brilliant Fantastic
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Elon should have been person of the year but we all know he will never be celebrated by the media ever again. That being said Taylor is worthy but also consider the fact she is doing this stuff because she likes it but it is also so she can build more massive wealth on the backs of broke girls....
Wow, she amazes me I’m a Swifty
Looks like those Satanic rituals she does on stage are finally paying off.
Hi friends
I admire her strength, courage, hard work ethic, and so much more. Her music has helped me to get through so much pain esp. over this past year.. but also back in 2020.. when the entire world shut down due to COVID, Taylor Swift released 2 new albums!!! Then it was like artists started making music again after she did that... Taylor is a true leader, and a good one at that. Thank you TIME!
Idiocracy the movie, get it, watch it, learn it, it is your future.
she really just did everything, gave more jobs, boosted the economy, etc, like she is so amazing
Hello from Russia. Taylor Swift is a wonder.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
ICON
Why do heteros always make everything about themselves!?😐
LEGEND👑 She 1000% deserves this title
Where can I read/watch the interview?
She really deserves it 🎉GO TAYLOR!!
I'm literally crying really hard when seeing this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😭😭😭
Congrats beautiful girl. You are awesome. ❤️
I live in Missouri and I am a huge Chiefs and Travis Kelce fan. I never listened to Taylor Swift but I am now a big fan. I’m a conservative Republican and I had a preconceived notion about her because my party does not like her at all and I always heard bad things. But I started researching  her and found out she gave out $55 million in bonuses to all the truck drivers on her tour. I had never heard of any singer doing that before. That impressed me right away. She has a beautiful sole and is such a kind person. Moral of the story. Don’t always believe what you hear. I’m so glad I found her. She truly deserves this honor. ❤
MOTHER I LOVE YOU ❤️
I actually wish that TIME also asked Taylor Swift on her work attitude/atmosphere with her team (background vocals, bands, dancers, etc). Some of them already with her for a very long time and this is the part that I wish I can learn one thing or two to apply in my leadership at work. She is definitely a phenomenal.
got goosebumps just by watching this. no one can do it like the music industry herself. TAYLOR SWIFT EVERYBODYYYYYYYYY!!!!!
She Deserves it. Congratulations Taylor ❤
Why. Did she end war? End hunger? End murder?
This is the sweetest in-your-face to people like Gyllenhall, Kardashian, & West who’ve broke Ms. Swift’s spirit. But we all know the TRUTH and she has proved her resiliency in a world where her kindness rose above all the ilk.
👎
<3
i made that bitch famous
pekora usada
What have she done to help society?
Entertainer of the Year and MOST Famous Celebrity of the Year but Person of the Year???? Hmmm... Humanity is not all about money and business.
I'm GenX, so i'm an older Swiftie, but Australian so we didn't really know her first album. I have 3 daughters, so we were in disney universe in the 2000s, there was some Taylor Swift but it wasn't much,  we liked it but were more Hannah Montana fans..... we enjoyed a lot of different artists, still loving Taylor, and then 1989.....we died dead RIP me, that was the beginning of being proper Swifties ( and frankly, I think 1989 was the beginnning of the phenomenon), and then . I still remember the car ride home from school where I played  TIWWCHNThings. Now we try to get together for a new release, we did this for Midnights. and then the vaults, then for all the album vault tracks since then. I have one traditional daughter, one creative, and one "progressive/delusional" and we are all Swifties.
and yet, Swifties amirite............ this is SO Rep coded. good for her, Rep is when she took hold of her life.
Time magazine is beyond pathetic.
Absolutely the perfect choice Thank you Time Magazine  OMG Thank you TAYLOR SWIFT
what a stupid story they came up with
Considering the world and what happening, they couldnt find someone more deserving? But a pop star who flies around with private jet contributing to global emissions and in her interview whines how she was almost banned and went through “so much” because music rights. She has no sense of reality and sounds like still stuck in 2000s. Forbes has gone down the drain
why am I not seeing any comments saying that this is so rep coded 😭😭 so proud of you Taylor ❤️❤️
she brings good vibes and money to allll and ppl are happy to spend on her
Why? She's less relevant now than she was 5 years ago. I guess USA as usual they think they're the entire world.
2023 is deffo taylors year
So did Kim Kardashian apologize ? She has to.
She is the GOAT and I’m so happy and proud to call myself a Swiftie! TY TSwift!
Her impact, influences and contribution not only to the music industry but for society, economics and political are on another level.
I'm just here to down vote the video
Actually Zeena Levey’s Satanic Clone (Cloning in Hollywood) witchcraft and sorcery. Wake up! She’s not who you think she is!
I hate that when asked. She called out kayane and Kim. And the haters went off on her. Stop whining and love the person she is and has overcame to be
Taylor Swift is most stream artist of year 。apple music ,Spotify ,Amazon music
Its insane the media is giving her more attention than she already gets
she the best.
Another fuckin' USA populism. I've never listen this girl all my life.
TIME can you PLEASE release the outtake and unphotoshopped picturres of Taylor? Especially the ones with her lifting her arms up. WE all want to see her armpits unphotoshopped. doesnt matter about any stubble etc. Just release them!
Picking SWIFT as Times magazine  person of the year is like putting lipstick  on a pig. It might make her look better but she's still a pig. SERIOUSLY, there are far more "IMPORTANT" people than her. This is pure FLUFF to sell more magazines.  CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION TO TIMES "RAG"
Wow, so much for those tireless (free) workers at the church feeding those in need, assisting people pay for their overdue bills, giving hair cuts to the homeless, baby sitting for free, giving rides to the doctors, store... Every church I've gone to has had great singers who play every instrument gladly for free. Just like a lot of you for over forty years I was yelled at, stepped on, cursed at, spit on, hit... Never a word of appreciation for my aching body or any of my many tears.
I love you Taylor ❤
Time is runniing outt be ready. God so loved the world that He gave His only Son (Jesus Christ) that whoever believes in Him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16 Receive Christ and believe today the consequences are eternal!
Salamat Inang Taylor because of you I survived this year’s adversary
Genuinely perfectly Lovely 💜
Те кто не с США знает хоть одну песню Тейлор Свифт? Она кроме США популярна?!
This doesn’t feel organic at all.
This was an incredible video. Loved it
Science and magic met by technicians up to the Taylor swift level is nearly godly power
Lord - Taytay deserves this soo much! No one else can move thousands and thousands (and thousands...) in a positive way she does. Taylor is an incredible songwriter and an extraordinary person - the greatest artist of our days and the most demanded human being at the moment. A good choice Time Magazin!!   👍👍
We love her because we can relate to her experiences in life.A captivating person,and so down to earth,at the same time.💛🧡💜
Is Time serious.
Well done Time
Congrats to Taylor!
MAGA mad over the cover of a magazine I’m positive most of them don’t even read 😂
I told everyone that would listen that one day when we're old, we're going to talk about the Eras Tour and 2023 like older folks talk about Woodstock and 1969. And we get to say we were part of it (for those fortunate enough to go).
imagine this... reputation came out when she was at the bottom of the world reoutation tv coming out when she's on top of the world.
its giving reputation vibes 🤩
Oct 21 is the date she occupied all 10 spots on the chart. That date adds unto 13. Wow!
Well deserved
Travis Kelce put her on the map. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
SMDH
Thanks to travis kelce.

Estoy llorando de emoción jajajaa
One thing I would disagree with is that the friendship bracelets started with your on your own kid. They were something swifties were doing long before that song. Taylor just finally referenced the tradition that was made in the song.
She will help a lot defeating crooked Donald trump, in 2024 . She’s a true patriot
These bracelets are so easy to make, why would anybody buy them?
TAYLOR, LA MUJER DEL MUNDO !!
🌹
✨Congratulations Taylor ✨🎉🥂
motaz azaiza deserves this!
Sigh
F you, Time. This is ridiculous. I love Taylor and this is still ridiculous. We have two wars, a pandemic and there’s no other “person” to choose to represent humanities great accomplishments? You choose a damn blonde rich girl? Again, I love her, but F you, Time.
Yeah okay
This makes me emotional. I just love her 😭❤ Taylor deserves everything!
❤️
I can't believe all you have to do is date Travis Kelce and you become the person of the year. The power of that man.
Because clowns rule the world 😂
I’m literally sobbing! She deserves the world😭♥️♥️♥️
Gross
Ain't no way yall gave Taylor swift the person of the year give it to someone who actually does something for the world
who is kim she is know one not a good actor, not a singer she cant even suck D good by the video she put out, the Kardashian think there someone there not #FIGHTITTAYLOR
The most over rated as well.
2023 is Taylor’s year, we are just living in it
I won't go into the reasons I have no interest in her, but now I love her because of the way the righties are so upset by this.
What a desperate Attempt to stay relevant?
Yes!!!! You’re on top of the world, can’t even see KW
love you taylor! ❤️❤️❤️
Long live…Taylor Swift. 🫶🏼 You have gotten me through so much this year. A music legend. A lyrical genius. An icon.  Just…thank you. This is so beyond deserved. ❤️❤️❤️
How many times can you put out the same album and disguise it as "Taylor's Version".  I give her credit - she is smart.  Becoming a billionaire by re-releasing old music and then having her tour put on the movie screens across the country.  Every day we have to hear Taylor this and that even on the evening news broadcast.  When does she get her martyr award??
Honestly,  you could have picked a better individual for this title. Sure, TS generated so much business but that's how it is when you have concerts and when you are that popular; it's given.
Taylor Swift is terrible, and everyone who listens to her has shit taste in music. Quality music is practically a lost art now. Swifties make me wanna puke. There were plenty of other more deserving people for this honor. Edit: I'm not an asshole, I just hate such mediocrity being so praised.
Taylor Swift brings us together and makes us happy. What a gift. Thank you Taylor Swift.
Me rn WEEPING in my office eating tacos on my lunch hour.
Taylor is so awesome. i am so sad i don’t have tickets for the tour but she truly deserves it i love you Taylor ❤️
Person of the year in what country? If just the states, then understandable
🩷
False idols  The firefighters and first responders and people helping in saving lives in these wars they deserve awards
It is lonely at the top but the view sure is nice
3 vids solve 3 mysteries: ONE: a Madagascar oddity detected via sat view on maps TWO: historic popularity of Taylor Swift THREE: the electability of Donald Trump . . youtube references follow: ONE: 00.24.32 Vox what’s inside this crater in Madagascar TWO: Taylor Swift 00.07.28 Time Magazine THREE: 00.17.01 David Brooks NY times may b we’re the bad guys . .

This isn’t new lol
Rep TV is coming 🖤
W Time
she has changed so many people's lives.. I love her so much
What I find truly pathetic is that Kim Kardashian does not act like a girl's girl. She lied about and bullied another woman, Taylor Swift, when both experience high levels of scrutiny and sexism from the media and society in general. Pity how low class Kim K acted
QUEEN OF THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm laughing that conservatives are having massive snowflake meltdowns over this 🤣
Who knows..2024 could even top 2023 for Taylor...There is Reputation to be release, Debut to be released...possibly TS 11 to be released...Another whole year of the Era's tour...Then of course there is her romance with Travis....And if this film coming out next year is actually penned by Taylor as many think...Is the world ready?????????? I know Swifties are...  :):)
Yesss Taylor 🥰
she's the light of my life
❤
I don't want to be a killjoy, but the sheer number of sycophants on here is staggering.  And do you suppose any of them even reads Time?  Does anyone?  I would only if it was either that or Modern Woman from July 2002 in the doctor's waiting room.
Thank God its not Nietanahu...
TIME really has a chokehold on the comments. IG has much more balanced feedback.
Well deserved!
Whst a load of crap, pffft, just another puppet for the ullimanatti magazine. What a joke she us.
I told my friends months ago that Taylor was the biggest name on the planet this year...Glad that Time magazine agrees
NICE!
Taylor and her Swifties will save democracy!
Not woman, this powerhouse is THE PERSON of the year. She IS the man.
It really is Taylor Swift era ✨
Jesus is coming Jesus he loves you he came and died for our sins you can repent and accept him as your lord and savior  remember we are not going to live for ever  what are you going to say when you go befor him guys hell is real you don't want to spend youre eternity in hell burning and saying if only i would have accepted Jesus as my savior come to his arms he is waiting for you!!!! i love you in Jesus name i just want you to be saved God bless you Don't have to respond just think about it he gave us free will so is youre choice if you let him in your heart and let the holy spirit change you life !!!!
She deserves the award❤️
This made me cry.. I've been a fan since the very beginning. Feels like we've been thru everything together. Love her so much.
一个多才多艺的演唱家,人也很善良。
gee, Xi Xingping has had NOTHING to do with advancing the WORLD's poor into the middle class.  TIME and ALL MSM are simply corporate sluts putting out what their OWNERS ALLOW.
Well,.....there you have it................I guess our brave servicemen, first responders, transportation drivers, airline pilots, and medical staffs will always fail in comparison to this extremely over-rated pop hoar who has news articles written about her latest bowel movement every five goddamn minutes.
Taylor Swift is only famous because she sold her soul to the devil. The consequences will be horrible, weeping and gnashing of teeth. My God of heaven have mercy on your soul.
I crack up watching the right wing loons lose it over this cover.  Waaaaaaaah is all they got.
Well deserved!
Leftist activists are seething. You people seriously believe the powers that be will allow minorities to take the lead post-BLM? 😂 You are to bow down to the Aryan Princess  Seriously though, this is a spit in the face to those who made sacrifices in the poorer regions of the globe. They really botched not having COVID frontliners inducted in 2020 (we got Sleepy Joe and the Cackler instead).
Makes sense. Worst year Ever. Criminal culture media love, fear of colds, and the LEAST TALENTED RICH BRAT WHOSE DADDY GOT HER THERE WINS THE TOP MORON AWARD.  2023  in a nutshell.
The most useless magazine ever.person of the year  hahah? T.swift haha
another vessel used for their plans to completely brainwash and corrupt the youth, lets gooo
the best thing about all of this is the enormous amount of positivity that she and the fun can create. For once, the person of the year is not  a politician, dictator, morally ambiguous businessman ... It's a cat lady - sure, incredible artist, hardworking human, and new billionaire.  Also, I appreciate that she seems (would love to say is but idk her irl) so nice, kind, and genuine. So proud to be a swiftie. keep spreading the love and positivity people !!
i want to see more about this, please
This gave me all the feels and Im not a typical "Swiftie", I'm a newbie and she's extraordinary!
yes, she is the person of the decade, and we know
Your person of the year swifty is what i use to clean my house Times magazine. We aint the same 😎
Can u imagine yr role model  not being a songwriter musician  show woman with class and grace and then looking up to a plastic talentless ageing anything to get their body out type of human ?
I LOVE TAYLOR SWIFT SO MUCH❤
Champion of spinsters and cat ladies
My grampa loves Taylor Swift. Not specifically for her music, but her as a human being.  Recently, my grampa said he predicts that “By 2024 or 2025, Taylor Swift will either start a record company where the artists and everyone involved get paid their fair share. Or she’ll start a ticketing company like Ticketmaster, except she’ll do it the right way, she won’t scam people or do any of the BS Ticketmaster did“   My grampa is a wise man, he’s lived a lot, he’s had a lot of experience. He’s a marine, he grew up in the projects, he’s had a lot of ups and downs throughout his life, that impacted him emotionally, physically, and mentally. He’s a very strong man, but he doesn’t take himself too seriously and he’s not as cynical as other old folks like my other grandfather for instance, who has one idea of what hard work is, and despises anyone who lives a different lifestyle than he does. My grampa is more excepting of the newer generation to a certain degree, if you want to be a baseball player or an actor, or a YouTuber, he’s very supportive of those dreams, and will encourage it. He can also read between the lines and see what’s real and what’s not. He’s not a Swiftie, he just likes her as a person. He watches the news a lot, he still reads the newspaper, and he still sees the stuff about Taylor in the news, and he doesn’t blindly side with the media when it’s reporting, but he takes that information in and has his own opinion about it.
I love Taylor Swift for the simple reason she makes us forget and ignore the very importance of our existence , our freedom and the treats to the same. She will however be irrelevant when the body bags start coming home because we ignored the important elements of our existence! Entertainment is entertainment and nothing else!
I had a friend in high school, (i graduated in the 90's) I had a friend who had moved from Utah and was Mormon. He shared the following with me.   His oldest sister went to the church to let them know that their father was sexually abusing her. The dad got a promotion within the church.  The second daughter realized that didn't do anything, so when it was her "turn" to report, she went to the authorities.   My friend was in 4th grade when that happened and said it was awful.   He was arrested as an adult for attempting to by pictures.   Wonder where he learned it from?
This shows the absolute irrelevance of time magazine. Americans will quickly realize the irrelevance of trivial entertainment and show biz when the body bags start coming home ( from wars of survival) that result from ignoring the things of importance, of life , freedom and of our very existence as a people!
love you, taylor! congrats i am so proud of you and us swifties 🫶💜
This is by far the clearest evidence of the irrelevance of time magazine and its organization!
She is 💯 the Person of the Year and the decade🫶🏼Good Job Time♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
What did that guy win ?
She's like the only good news of 2023
Must have been a bad year
She's white Oprah
QUEEN
absolute bullshit and nonsense
Never heard about this singer Lol
Congratulations Taylor , who brings the love❤️❤️❤️
OMG I'm so sad that I didn't get tickets to the eras tour! Y have loved her for soooo long, and i am from Uruguay, so when she came to Argentina, i felt like that was my shot! I wasn't so lucky though, but I hope I get to see her live at least one time in my life. I think I'll just keep on blowing my birthday candles over this whish untill it comes true!
What did she do to help humanity? What great sacrifices did she make to achieve those goals? Focus on real ppl making change vs this garbage
I can't wait to hear Fox News' opinion on this.  Their freakin' heads are gonna explode LOL
When is this commie doing porn 🤔 otherwise I don't care
She's such an inspiring human being. I'm so proud of being a fan of her and enjoying this journey with everyone ❤It's been definitely our year.
My god, i love her! And i’m so proud of her. She’s been the one constant in my life for the past 15 years.
😂🤣😂🤡
I didn't know any other pop artist, a bunch of years ago. I lost touch with popular music, over time. And yet, I thought it was interesting how the only pop artist, I was familiar with, was scarfing up all these awards. And each year, you think, hm, it's gonna die down. This time. It's definitely gonna die down, unless she go for Nobel Peace Prize. I like some of her stuff, but songs I hear on the radio are kinda suspect. People big into the performance aspect of Swift. And definitely a connection with her audience. I hope she go for Peace Prize. It kinda easy to like Taylor Swift. She has cool cats. Time Magazine's gets most strong likes and strong dislikes, ever, for choice of 'Person of the Year.' I think it funny how artists have names for fans. At some point, being a 'Swiftie' became something cool, and then this year, it took off. She should dedicate one song, per album, to a 'cause.' And. That peace prize will end up in HER possession. Um. Why Chiefs 8-4?
5am and I'm crying because of all those marriage proposals. So touching!
well done Taylor . . .
it's impressive the lack of pop culture that she and everything she does has, it's amazing how the American media wants to shove this girl down our throats manipulating us think she's relevant just because she's the face of the American dream. this is insane.
The world is losing it... Vomit
Of course she deserved it!!!!! From lovestory to you're losing me I've been her fan!!! Please come to india😢
Bawling. When the world finally recognises her worth and what she’s doing for us. I’m a mess.
riding the hype train are we?
„a person, a group, idea, or object that "for better or for worse... has done the most to influence the events of the year“   She for sure didn’t influence any event really that is important
For what?! For daring to wear the worst outfits at concerts?!
Trump 2024…🇱🇷
Trump 2024….🇱🇷
I love Taylor so so much!!! She absolutely deserves the success and love she's getting. She's only going to continuing getting better
Can we have this video on Instagram?
well deserved😊
I bet this Time Magazine issue will break records too. All her fans would want a copy of it.
Should have been Benjamin Netanyahu.
She IS the art
Who else could it have been???
I am just thankful that we get such a surge of positivity in the world due to her influence. I became her fan this year ❤
I'm so proud to have been following Taylor since debut. It's been an incredible seventeen years, I can't wait to see what the future holds. Congratulations on Person of the Year Taylor!
https://youtu.be/BZt-t8e1L_I?si=JFAdgsP2EOEWG7jN
Who?
I paid 185 € for her concert next yr . And I'm def not gonna sell it
Taylor was the face of 2023, she was glorious and 2024 will be even bigger 😮❤
is it normal to cry watching this?? 😭😭  i love you so much taylor!  - swiftie since 2009 🫶🏻
So when’s she going to invade Poland?
Woman shaking her ass and singing song gets person of year while Journalists like Motaz azaiza fighting everyday to survive in Gaza to show the world the genocide committed by Israel in Gaza don't even get any recognition in media. Truly the world of white west imperialism.
i hope future generations dont believe this was all real, the liberals control everything and they do not represent the real people of this time.
This video is tear-inducing. Thank you for bestowing this well-deserved honor upon Taylor Swift. She had an amazingly positive impact on people around the world in 2023. She's incredibly talented, smart, inspiring, kind, creative, hard working, thoughtful, humble, etc.
Taylor is incredibly talented, she deserves this moment ❤
why.. just because the left wing controls everything? she hasnt done anything special in a decade...  i guess they are PROPPING HER UP TO PANDER FOR JOE BIDEN
GUYS IS IT JUST ME OR DO ALL OF THE PHOTOS AT THE START LOOK REPUTATION THEMED?!!??!!!!!
where can we buy the cover of Time in France ?
Person of the year? Seriously? It seems she's not just in a relationship with a rich man, she's sleeping with the entire American deep state.
i’m crying so happy for her
I cried watching this video. We’re so lucky to be in this era. In Taylor’s Era. Thank you for everything ❤
Trump will definitely hate and attack Taylor Swift again.
Excellent choice. Swift has impacted so many things and people in positive ways this year. Her accomplishments and impact on the economy are enormous.
😍👑
she needs to f go away, like bitch just settle you''re about to die.
Let's hope when the next pandemic hits TS will represent and volunteer in hospitals and ICU.
😍😍😍
Idk but I'm literally crying
mother deserved!!
her. her.
the way i jumped when she posted the photos on instagram😭😭 i thought shes announcing rep tv
I love her! She's a positive in this mad world we live in!
An illiterate, narcissist, woke woman, person of the year... wtf
YAAASSSS AS SHE SHOULD I LOVE TAYLOR
Deserve ❤🫶💞
Taylor is Love.  She gives love, and we love her for it!
Wow, Time has completely lost my respect.  Nothing against Taylor Swift, I just thought this honour was for more than just pop cultural contributions. All I see are people grasping to condone this.  Sad day.
Taylor is 2023 🎉
Will she date George Soros next or someone from the Carlisle Group Gang?  Ew.
Go Taylor! 🥰
She deserves more than this tbh
Took awhile to figure out how to buy a copy from Canada. Surprised to find out that Twitter/X was the way
why am i crying watching this AHHHHHH
She does good things for humanity❤
this is everything except ''amazing''....it is pure simple math....Time figures all the brainless Swifties will buy the edition thus making a killing at the end of the year where clearly less and less Americans are reading...please give me a break....any ''doctor behind borders'' p.e. deserves it more than her...she has got a $ Billion now in the bank so cool it people...the margins for awards have become so low....oh well....Grammy to a 9 yr old / Golden Globe for best Comedy to The Martian..now Taylor gets this public notice added....PATHETIC
This gives me chills! She’s such an amazing person! Love you Taylor 🤍
good job taylor, i love to see one of the greatest artists ever give a nobody a chance to shine, I’m sure kanye would be proud of you 🥲
this is so eurocentric. it's so dumb and ignorant. especially with things like Hamas invasion happening this year.
For everyone here, type into the YouTube search bar, “HG Tudor”. He gives an interesting case study on Taylor Swift.
it was a long long time coming tbh.. actually i'm never been so happy
Sending this video to everyone asking why she was picked 💓💓💓
VERY DESERVING!!!! stfu haters
❤❤❤❤
The most powerful thing about Taylor is the love she gets, she deserves and she gives back. Even acknowledging her makes someone a good person. She gives back so much, even unknowingly is really baffling! Its a loving family Tay and you created it!
🤢
Nooooooo.... Why has it come to this?😭😭😭😭😭😭
Glorifying mediocrity at its finest. PR agencies should be named firms of the year, as they successfully shove these people down everybody's throat till they start liking these "celebs"
Person of the year being someone who is silent on a genocide...
🎉❤
This has my ENTIRE HEART! WE LOVE YOU TAYLOR, all the way from India! 🧡🤍💚
We have servicemen and women rt NOW in the Mediterianean who could die in war!! Maybe by their choice or not, and we think a singer who will be forgotten in 5yrs and her stupid relationship will matter?! Our society is gone when we think this is th greatest thing! SAD.
Yep Etsy shut that down too!
Everybody bashing on her induction as the Person of the Year, needs to watch the full video to understand the impact she has made in people's lives. In an economy like today, her tour generated innumerable jobs and revived lives. That is enough to measure her success as an artist and as a public figure.
love her or hate her, it's impossible to deny the cultural impact she's had this year and throughout her career, and the joy she brings to her millions of fans. absolutely deserved, keep it up, taylor !! <3
mother just mothering as always 🥰
How I love and proud of being a Swiftie ❤
Love her or hate her she was everywhere on everything this year....person of the year makes sense tbh
<3
I’m just sitting here crying reflecting back on the life I’ve had with her by my side. I’m so unbelievably proud. I love her so much.
I hate her with a burning passion
I hate her so much,
my  QUENNN
TIME got it right two years in a row.!
I'm so happy for the fact that this gal is so amazing. I have followed you for many many years . . As I know many have too ❤
🥹🩵🩵
I figured... beautiful woman of the year! ❤️
Wow.
GUYS THIS WHOLE THING IS SO REP THEMED IM GOING DELULU
So sweet of you to include Calvin Denker ❤
So proud ❤❤❤
It’s about time to have some GOODNESS in this world!🙏🙏💕
Well deserved!
the real time people of the year are the palestinian journalists!!!
Positive person…with positive messages to her fans.  Keep it up Tay.
This made me so emo😭❤️
"The eras tour is my Roman Empire" - is a quintessentially 2023 sentence
Muchas felicidades Taylor, es alucinante como 6 años atrás eras de las personas más odiadas de internet pero ahora en este momento vuela la cabeza porque ahora todo el mundo te ama ❤ es una locura
Thank you Time Magazine!! Taylor Swift is such a positive role model for many  such as myself. Not only is she beautiful she also has a brain! She makes choices and doesn't care what others really think of her in which I find that very courageous of her. She can still look hot and sexy without revealing too much clothing. I really admire her grace, poise and how she carries herself with such elegance. I couldn't be more happier for Taylor after all that she has been through. Thank you Taylor, Thank you Time magazine!! Also thanks for allowing Taylor to take a photo with her cat! It's so cute!!! 😊🙂✨✨✨👍👍👍👍👍
The woman she is!😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤❤❤
Taylor Swift is crap
Proud Swiftie since 2006!!!
I guess her next song will be about her and Travis breaking up😂😂
I guess it makes sense. Hollywood strikers would have also
I don't like (nor dislike) her music but she is a force of nature. Smart, beautiful, talented. She is adored by many. So, yeah, good choice, Time Magazine.
the glazing is wild
Weird thumbnail
idk but..i'm crying..🤧
Congratulations to Taylor Swift - I wish her continued success,  health and happiness.
she's the best
what the reputation
I love this and you all executed this so well. She really is the people’s hero and we’re proud of our girl! Definitely Eras tour was best thing to come out of 2023.
the queen...👏👏👏🥰
SHE changed cities and towns.. 💋💋💋
Not that last shot of her wearing a cat around her neck  I’m dying 💀
2023 (Taylor's Version). She run the whole world!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Now we know why she always has her forehead covered in hair lol
So right.
Who?
Love your masterpiece and creations Taylor
Hey this been popped up on my recommended because you two knows I'll watch Taylor Swift anyways first things first everybody who listens to her music and I'm knowing I'm probably the only one that does this 24/7 but be honest with you every other people that I listen to her other albums have different taste
Motaz Azaiza and  all the journalists , who put their lives at risk or lost their lives  to  share the genocide in Palestine our taxes fund..those ended up being Person of the Year in my eyes. the value of the message they brought to humankind far exceeded the Roman spectacle of entertainment
Amazing choice. In almost a hundred years of existence TIME has never chose an entertainer as Person of the Year and it was about time. This was literally THE Taylor Swift year. She dominated culture and boosted economies everywhere.
I love how she is so inclusive! Her dancers, back up singers, designers, crew, everyone! She’s just an awesome human being! I will never understand all the hate some people have for her… how can you hate someone so real, so kind, & so down to earth???
an absolute queen
in my eyes, taylor will forever be the small country artist I fell in love with at 8 years old. I still can't fathom the fact that she's the biggest artist in the world (and I'd argue in our entire generation). I couldn't be more proud 🥺
We live in a world where person of the year goes to whoever has more sales and sheep followers.
Lmao
Great job by taylor!!
This made me emotional. I was definitely tearing up at the end🥹
She is very powerful...wow
🇸🇩🇸🇩🇮🇱🇮🇱🇺🇦🇺🇦🇷🇺🇷🇺
As an official fan girl, this has been a great great year.  The connection and comradery has been unreal this year.  I'm so grateful to be alive in this generation!
She’s sooooo incredible!!!!!
❤
can taylor swift stop children and animals from being abused. can she help cure cancer. does she donate any of her millions of dollars that tweens and gay guys willingly spend on her garbage music to any causes at all.....she is a mediocre pop star not the second coming of christ ok 😂😂😂😂
THE poster-child for, "Bat$ hit C razy".
She deserves all the accolades. Wonderful musician, songwriter and of course human being!!
Idol worship 🤮
So many proposals have happened during her concert which makes me so happy☺️❤
Like I’m literally in tears after watching this
Good things happen to good people
The whole photoshoot is so rep coded
JOY!  You, Miss Taylor Swift, have elevated the WORLD!  Thank you.  CONGRATULATIONS!  🎉❤😊
I love you taylor
That is so sad, our world is sick.
this is a huge rep tv easter egg
Why is Taylor actually giving reputation with these photos???Is she trying to tell us something???😮😮😮
This makes me so emotional. I love you forever and always, Taytay!! I'm sooo proud of my girl!! <3
Awesome 👍
WHAT AN INCREDIBLE TRIBUTE! I adore her!!!!!
not surprise at all. I'm so proud of her ❤👏
Congratulations Taylor! What an incredible 2023!!!
Good for her
I got chills watching the proposals 🥹
congrats girl, you gave us nothing !! 🥳
I could watch this forever..& ever.. Congratulations Taylor!!! 💙💙💙💙💙
Taylor Swift appeals to those, women in particular, who have developmental delays.   Grown independent women making friendship bracelets.
next rerecording is taylor swift because head cowboy
Swifties are a cult.
Congratulations Taylor ❤️ she is absolutely a gift to this world. Her music spans across generations and cultures, creating a community of kindness, generosity and love. Thank you. Taylor for sharing your light❤
love her or hate her, you can't deny she's the music industry, the biggest star in the world. we love you, taylor. so proud of yoouuuu 😍😍😍
YES SO DESERVED
It’s not just Taylor. It’s the community she’s created for us. Love you, Swifties! 🫶🏻
GEORGIOUS BEBE
We do love her.
Deserved! ❤
OMG this is the most pathetic thing ever  Hahahahahahahaha hahahahahahahaha hahahahahahahaha hahahahahahahaha. Hahahahahahahaha
I just cried watching this wow
Don't know much about her but she must be a great humanitarian and donate Millions to the less fortunate. And no, the trash doesn't take itself out, never forget where you come from.
Can't stop crying. This was so special
Congrats Taylorr, as a swiftie ilysm u are so inspiring and your music is my fav, u deserve this!!!
Mediocracy at its highest
This is EMBARRASSING Typical elitist wealthy celeb, except this one is the leader of her own cult
Of course, many can say that this is not objective, but I personally am tired of politicians and businessmen. I'm glad that Person of the Year is Taylor
Woow thats absolutely amazing for Taylor Swift very Gorgeous and very kind...Thank you TIME...we love you Tay...#tayvis #travlor..from Philippines😘😘😘
She is serving reputation and Im here for it 🖤
I don't resonate with Taylor's music, but watching her create so much joy, excitement and connectivity worldwide is beautiful.
I hope y’all ran this by Kanye
BRAVOOOOOOOOOOO, most deserving of all
Congratulations Taylor Swift! So well deserved!! My heart is so  happy for you!!!
YASSSSS ❤️❤️❤️
Taylor Swift is definitely the most deserving of Person of the Year. She has done so much for the world and brings so much joy to everyone. Thank you Taylor Swift. ❤❤❤❤
I love her 😍
Totally ridiculous. The obvious person of the year  by a country mile should be V O L O D Y M Y E R    Z E L E N S K Y.
statistically, she’s the musician of the year. she’s likely the highest paid celebrity of the year too. if this was billboard/forbes magazine, her ranking at the top would be more appropriate.  but TIME magazine usually attempts to reflect wider than the entertainment industry, and focus on world issues. with that being said, i was expecting journalists on the ground in gaza to be the person of the year, like motaz.
Beautiful ❤
Thank you Time for seeing the magic in Taylor and how she makes so many people happier because of her music and storytelling! I just subscribed!
Taylor’s got it all. She really is a force.  But I hope people who serve let’s say in the healthcare force or other fields gain recognition for the services they provide. They are so many people working so hard, earning less, but have made an impact in the society.
And???
Good 👍 Taylor 👏 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Regardless if you like her music or not, you have to admit she is the moment.
I've been a fan of her's since 2012, she was my first favorite artist and getting to stand by her till this point has been incredible. The amount of accomplishments she's achieved this year is unfathomable and I cannot put into words how special she is. I'm so happy I got to see her this year at the eras tour and I cannot wait to see what she does in the future. Love you to the moon and to Saturn Taylor 🤍🪐
Can’t say I’m surprised
I'm going to have nachos for dinner.  Yumm!!
im so happy for her and happy in general
Uncle Donald isn't gonna like this! Watch him start tweeting hate towards Ms Swift. Congrats, Ms Swift!
Uhhh....NO!
I don’t get it, we have so many hero’s and yet the only thing that we are carrell into is a sexual  object
AMAZING!!
The way I cried watching this video. TS has been the person of my year for the longest time. No one deserves this more than her. The woman of the decade.  Thank you TS. Words can’t express how much you mean to us ❤️👏😭
Great choice! You go girl! Taylor Swift brings so much light to the world
i love her so fucking much.
Why ??? Cause she makes song for teenage girls with heartbreaks lmao 🤣
I liked her better with her original nose; gave her a sweeter look.
I love u taylor u r so amazing congrats
All hail the queen!
She is so deserving of this accolade
I'm shocked. It's definitely not my cup of tea.
The upcoming vault tracks for Reputation will be “fire,” she promises. The rerecordings project feels like a mythical quest to her. “I’m collecting horcruxes,” she says. “I’m collecting infinity stones. Gandalf’s voice is in my head every time I put out a new one. For me, it is a movie now.”
Wow. This is so amazing for Taylor. Person of the Year, Spotify's Global Artist of the Year. So happy for her!
DESERVED💗💗💗💗💗
Well that made me teary eyed...
Good way to describe him. Person of the year. Wake up
Her song, " You’re on Your Own, Kid " makes me cry everytime. She is able to sing about deep feelings that others can't seem to capture. She's certainly a light in this year.
Is she transgender
Dump woman leading females to hell
I came all the way here to find a video to say: congratulations Loira. Person of the year. News here say As Divas do Pop earning tons of money. You and Beyonce. Must be nice to have that kind of money, isn't it?
The true POTY is U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika. She's the Judge that rejected Hunter Biden's bogus plea deal. This kind of honesty and integrity is seldom seen in this country anymore.
I became a Swiftie, at age 76, while watching her movie "The Eras." I loved it--all of it.
Taylor Swift: 0% Pornogaphy 0% Twerking 0% drugs 0% Harsh Word  🎉100% Art & creativity
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Well deserved!!!👏👏👏🥰
Perfect!! Taylor is precious, bright and talented. I hope she continues to succeed in her professional life and her private life. Blessed be Taylor Swift, blessed be.    ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
All the “teeth scrapers” out there choose her!
This made me CRY
Why am I crying... oh wait. Because I got to be alive at the same time as Taylor Swift :D
👍👍👍
love that I’m alive the same time period as taylor swift
So grateful I grew up in her era. From country to pop, I was there each time a song or an album was released❤️❤️ Even I couldn't count how many times she made me feel "not alone". I've got a song I can relate to for whatever it is that I'm going through. That's her genius.  Now I'm not surprised that she got all these achievements but man,  what a massive success to have this kind of effect GLOBALLY👏🙌
Love her sooooo very much! ❤
WELL DESERVED ❤️TAYLOR SWIFT❤️
what a joke.
"The Lovers" section of this video had me crying till the end, how flippin' sweet!! So happy for all those couples, and proud of the Swiftie community for being so supportive of these couples and helping to make their special moments even more memorable ❤
Taylor is extremely giving, gifted, talented ,and a hard worker! She deserves it alll.
RIDICULOUS!  TIME is turning into THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER!
Love, love, love this!!! She totally deserves this!! ❤
Amazing woman!
❤YAY TAY TAY!!! You absolutely deserve this and SO much more ❣️Benjamin is the HANDSOMEST lil guy I’ve ever seen on the cover of a magazine ❣️Congrats!🍾
It’s giving reputation tv
Eewwwwwww
Never understood why people call Beyoncé the ‘queen’ when Taylor is literally THE music industry. Having been a fan since 2008 it’s insane to see how much she has dominated everything she touches since then. She might not know me but I’m proud of her 🥲
❤❤❤❤ I love you Taylor
So well earned. Such an incredible and inspiring human.
All hail the Queen
Well deserved! 🫶🎉
This was so very well done. All of it. Bravo! 👏
A powerhouse. Continue talking to your followers about voting. 💙
Great way to sell magazine..period...the women in war zones and people dont
Love you Taylor!!! ❤
for some reason I couldn't help myself from crying
From Europe: I have to admit that I have never heard her singing.
Taylor Swift Forever🥰🥰🥰
This video, the piece in the issue… makes me soo emotional and so proud to be by her side for over 15 years now. Forever a Swiftie
Whether you enjoy her music or not, she has brought people together and helped young girls be okay with how they feel bc she has felt that way too!
Who cares? Rich and dumb!
ridiculous
She deserves it. She's worked countless hours helping Shriners find a cure for all the children with cancer. She's saved countless lives with brain and heart surgeries. Homelessness is non-existent. Rents and mortgages are affordable to all. Now the next feat- she will raise her mic and with a steadfast swoosh she will declare world peace!!! Go T!!!
It’s just too bad she’s a biden supporter lol…
VERY Well Deserved!!!! She is a QUEEN!!!
August 20 - finally get to see my Queen in London, cannot waaaaaaaaiiiiiittttttt 🤩
CONGRATULATIONS  Tay🫶🫶Tay💝
Yay! Great choice. Taylor is a hard worker and extremely talented.  Much respect to Time and Taylor. 🎊
She truly deserves it all, there's no one else who I'd rather be at the top!!
So proud of my mother 🩷
😭 ❤ My girls loved the Eras tour and my husband practiced and learned all the songs for the concert so he could belt them out with us. It was a day to remember, and even days after we still felt the euphoria. Well deserved!
A proud swiftie since 2008! Congratulations, Taylor Alison Swift!!!
This is ABSOLUTELY breathtaking and amazing to see. Because as someone who is a fan, a writer, a true admirer of her as an artist she has pushed herself so far. AND OT PAYED OFF❤ When Times got tough her music was there, during an epic summer her music was there and I ❤️ the fact that it doesn’t seem to be going away anytime soon! I might be a new (er) swiftie but I am sure still a great one.
Get Schwifty……… shit on the floor!
woohoo
Wow!
American culture be wild! You guys celebrate the absolute worst of society 😂
Didn't know Taylor Swift before and don't understand, what makes her so important?   Popular artists rise and fall all time, I don't see how is she different from other dozens of pop singers, the "person" of the year which made the most influence on the society should be definitely the AI.
She is The Man ❤
Oh god... why am I ugly crying??
Congratulations Taylor Swift.  Her storytelling skills are genius.   She deserves all the praise for her ability to connect with so many people.
So Happy for her. She's a wonderful person.
I stopped listening to Taylor during my last relationship because my ex convinced me to think the way she thought (sad to admit). It wasn’t until after our break up, summer 2020, and listening to Evermore that I realized how much I and other people like me and unlike me Needed Taylor Swift in the form of her lyricism. Such a cliche to say you feel “heard” by a song, but that album WORD FOR WORD depicted such intimate details of my relationship. She simply understood the experience that I so desperately wanted to voice into words but didn’t know how. She truly truly truly saved me from the worst possible scenario I was giving myself at the time. I genuinely don’t know if i’d be here without that Evermore album. This aside, she is a power house, a hard working class act. She is single handedly helping repair the economy, has led to 70k+ of new registered voters, not to mention her endless charity work and help she provides to fans in need. She is a beacon for other artists, paving way for them to see the importance in owning their own music, helping artists gain confidence in their own power. I fear we will never see another Taylor Swift in our lifetime, and that truly should say it all.
Well deserved !!!!!❤❤❤
Yesss!
She deserves this so much. She's just a good human
It is so great you chose someone who bring happiness, art, joy and inclusivity all over the world.
To think she would be too old and irrelevant by now (her own words!) versus what actually, rightfully is happening, is so insane. The Swifties community is not perfect but most of the time it is so fun, accepting and kind. Love Taylor and all of you fellow fans!
Good choice! I don’t think it could have been anyone else. We needed what she brought to the table this year! I’m almost 50 and a Swiftie! I wish I could go to the Eras Tour 😩!
All I can say is wow…. An absolute legend…..
Yassss! Well-deserved.
Congratulation to Taylor and she's fans
Aww this everything Swifties rule I love us and Taylor forever 💗 💓 🫶🏻💃🏼
I have been a Swiftie since 2007. That's more than half my life. Taylor Swift is and always will be a force of nature. 💚💛💜❤️💙🖤💖🤍🤎💛❤️💙💜💙
This woman just keeps getting bigger and bigger every year
Lol wft ?😂😂😂😂
Those women selling bracelets with her song titles, that's trademark infringement, I'm surprised Time reached out to them
Love❤
thank you TIME!
Taylor Swift is a Brilliant Beautiful Bright Light in a Dark Era ... In a world full of Trump idiocy and hatred ... *Be Like Taylor* ... #Vote!
This video is proof that Taylor is the biggest star in the world at the moment: creating jobs, boosting city economies, changing the lives of people she's never met. It's simply fantastic to be here to witness this!
Yürü bebeğim yürü kızım benim ✊🏿💪🏽🌈🥂💕
This brought tears to my eyes, I’m not gonna lie. Love you, TayTay!! I’m so proud of you!!! ❤🫶🏼❤️🫶🏼❤️🫶🏼
Dumbest thing almost ever....naming Caitlyn Jenner Woman of the Year was dumber
I became a swifter after seeing her concert movie at the theater and I have fallen in love with her songs especially from folklore!
I'm a Swiftie but I must say this is well-deserved.
Taylor Swift is a musical force of nature. The photo of her with her cat Benjamin Button is iconic. Congratulations Taylor, you deserve this honor!  🇺🇸
I’ve been a Taylor Swift fan since I was 6 - 7 years old, now I’m 18 years old. She has been a super hero for me and millions of people and I’m so proud of her. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH TAYLOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EVERYTHING 😭❤️❤️❤️
TAYLOR ALISON SWIFT.
This has to make her opposition to Mr Trump and the Republicans in general more important.  I’ve followed her since the beginning because I have two granddaughters who loved her.   She has a huge voice and uses it wisely - as a Democrat I appreciate her efforts to get this country back in the hands of sane people.
“She Believed She Could, So She Did!” ✨💫
Person of the Year but real quiet about the gen*cide in Pal*stine
MY MOTHER IS FAMOUS ❤
I'm surprised the ''woke'' society is not protesting saying dylan mulvaney should of been the Person of the Year..!!!!!!!!!!!
She better stays out of politics too 🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴
crying, she has impacted my life so much ever since I was a child :’) I love her, this is so well-deserved
OMFG, SHE IS THE MUSIC INDUSTRY, SHE IS THE MAN.
Didnt that security guard get let go?  Or was that another person?
Of course she is. 👸🏼
My heart is so full. As a fan for over 10 years I'm so proud of her as she just grows and grows 🤗❤
Yuck she's gross
At a time when there seems to be so much darkness in the world, Taylor banishes the darkness with her light and brings so much happiness to the world. Her happiness is a manifestation of her love and there can be never too much love in the world❤
Whether one loves or hates her, her impact and influence — especially this year — is undeniably legendary. She is so deserving of this title and I’m so proud
Would prefer to see someone who deserves it. I don’t get it. Someone who is charitable, working on climate change, helping people. This is ridiculous. She is causing climate issues by leaving a carbon footprint with her jet. She gives some money but not what a billionaire should give. How does she help people. Her music is about past relationships. You people are nuts.
Her? Sorry, but...😂😂😂😂. Maybe like, I dunno, first responders, like the ones who rushed in the school in Tennessee and saved children. Or any others like them.  Oh well. Shows our priorities.
Taylor flies private over 200 times a year.  However she wants you and I to feel horribly about climate change.  Wake up sheeple.
I’m subscribing to this magazine.
Hey Sweetie, You and TIME Magazine think a lot alike. The only reason Time honored you with this award is because you both Hate President Donald John Trump!
Hooray! A white heterosexual billionaire won! So edgy that they chose a—GASP—woman!
I am not even a huge fan of Taylor, but l am happy to hear that she is the person of the year! She has such a positive and powerful effect on millions of people.
The fact that someone like Ms Swift has garnered what was an historically significant designation in the world  today proves that Time magazine bankrupt of all social, political and environmental reporting responsibilities. While I admire her talent, I disregard her importance on the world scene. In fact, it's another distraction which thinking citizens must endure until our government faces its people and their issues.
OMG!!!! I M SOO HAPPY 😍TAYLOR SWIFT TOTALLY DESERVES THIS!!!!💜💜💜💜MOTHER IS EVERYWHERE & RULING THE WORLD !!!!
Taylor is 🎉❤
So bloody proud of her!!! I'm even more proud to have been her fan since 2009. Have always been with her, up or down, and will always be!
She is a really remarkable person. Especially. Being a celebrity! Come on their is no one else like her! What an Honor@
I SMELL REP TV ANNOUNCMENT
❤❤❤
YAY :) 😇
couldnt have picked a better person.
Person of the year: Not a scientist, a humanitarian or an inovator but a woke entertainer elite... What else did you expect from Time...
YES TAYGOD!
The best pick for person of the year!!  She brings happiness with her music and personality!!  It’s finally her time in the world after years and years of bashing her for every move she makes. She came back strong and positive after all the criticism she’s taken. No one can touch her now!!  Congratulations Taylor!!
This made me bawl my eyes out 😭😭
The proposals get me every time <3
Taylor Swift is serving Reputation on that cover and other shoots!!
WOOOOOOOOHOOOOO GO TAYLOR<3
Amo a Taylor, pero este video es una oda al capitalismo 😂
Period
GOOOO QUEEEENNNNN SLAAYYYYYYYY🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
That’s literally me at 0:43
im so grateful i was able to attend the eras tour in rio
Taylor should run for President.
Really! she has brought joy to the world I guess for people under 30! Please give me a break!!! Lol 😂
Yeah this shows you how you how "image" is everything in this country. This person who is nothing without her Aryan-Nordic appearance  can't sing, can't dance, can't "perform" and her tuneless songs are "Taylor-made" for the "MeToo" generation. I'm not a big Madonna fan,  but Swift doesn't come close to having the same talent as she does. I wonder where Swift will be ten years from now when all she has left are songs people can't even remember.
Not that I have ever read Time magazine, but my God... you're DEFINITELY trolling with this one!
So well done!
Time finally got it right for a change!
Wow Taylor, I love you. You have impacted my life, for real. Congrats to you!
Taylor has always been there for us and we will always be there for her   Congratulations Taylor we love you so much! You deserve all the praise and success in the world 🫶🥰
🤮
I think that she is born to make history... She is my favourite when I was 13 - her lucky number... Every swiftie wants her to make  history, break records and also release rep Tv...I love her .... And I also think that at 2024 Grammy's she is going to make history again for Album of the year award because her 10 studio album midnights deserve that... Well all of her albums deserve Grammy... Well she is music industry..Our mother is mothering ..... I am so happy for her and I will always love her..🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
We love Taylor because not only is she an incredibly talented singer songwriter but she is 'real' in the true sense of the word.  I'm SO excited to be going to see her perform in Liverpool June 24.
Yeayayayayay
Why is this video making me cry?
Where can I get this print issue in the UK?
Yaaaaaas Queen, bless and thank you !!
Her three cats must be so proudest of her
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Saw the Eras Tour in Cincinnati.  Never felt energy like that before.  Truly incredible.  This was HER year and I have a feeling she's going to have many more years like this because she just keeps getting bigger and better!  That's hard to do in this day and age.
Absolutely deserved! She has transformed the music industry, stood up for women’s rights and advocates for music ownership. We love it!
GREAT CHOICE..SHE MADE MY LIFE BETTER
Excellent! ❤️
It is a amazing time I can not even explain it it is amazing time 😉
Hi! I've been a Swiftie since September 2023, very new to this amazing community. I have so much music and content to catch up on but I'm so happy to be here
Her work ethic, commitment to the shows, rehearsing but also not forgetting to have fun and live in the moment, acknowledging to being in spotlight but finding spark in it and obviously her bonding with her family and cats   The way she handles the critique and mostly comes back stronger through her art and not being mean to them. Finding a way of inspiration after losing all her master's.  It's all just so suureal and she deserves every bit of success that she has today.  I just love her so much and she inspires me everyday.   Proud would be an understatement of how I'm feeling right now
Taylor is a (positive) force of nature! ❤
Hail the demise of music.
Etsy always shuts stores down with Taylor Swift product's, lol. That is such a bizarre thing to promote
I've been a massive Swiftie since 2008 and to say I'm happy for her would be an understatement! Taylor has worked incredibly hard in an industry that constantly tries to tear her down and is more than deserving of the place she is in today. 🩵
Absolutely pathetic the world has come to this.
queeen
I’m happy that the girl no one wanted to be friends with has risen to the top and beyond. Just look at the heavy weights that flock to defend her from every category now. Her actions have opened many doors and many hearts and minds along the way. Good for her.. her hard work and commitments speak volumes for her. Love her or hate her.. She has become a positive iconic figure and has ultimately left her mark on this world. Yay Taylor!
I had never really paid attention to her, until this year, as a woman in her late fifties, not really her demographic. That said, OMG I've never been so impressed by the generosity and the "movement" that she has inspired and she will save democracy, I don't know all the words to any of her songs, but, count me in I'm a Swifty.
Ah America, land of the hypocrites. Aren't you guys always telling us we're supposed to care about climate change? Ignore the fact that Taylor's one of the worst individual carbon polluters in history with her constant jetting from city to city to enrich herself. American culture celebrates nothing so much as greed and selfishness. Taylor fits those qualities to a T.
whY AM I CRYING
Put a chick in it and make her lame and gay.  Time is woke trash, who cares what they/them think.
She deserves it!!!! I hope that she continues to break records and be successful for years to come!!! I’ve never been more proud to be a swiftie!!!💚💛💜❤️🩵🖤🩷🩶🤎💙
Anyone else SOBBING?!
well deserved
Game on, Travis. You'll need every Kelce for help. Suggest you challenge her on a golf course -- not putt, putt.
Her fans are easily-manipulated teen morons and will die siding with her.  TIME - you couldn't find anyone more deserving given this borderline record-breaking year of political, environmental and financial issues? She's spent most of the year in a private jet, hanging around with a known racist, staying silent on a genocide and just being overall greedy. Self-serving rich woman wins again, shocker.  The headline should read "TIME magazine so desperate for sales they choose Taylor Swift."
this video made me sob. the community she has created is so beautiful. i fall more in love with being a swiftie every day. THANK YOU TAYLOR 💞💞💞 we’re so fucking proud of you. love you so so much.
How incredible is that for you……..congrats Taylor you deserve this"…………………Donna in Toronto
👏👏👏👏👏👏 you deserve it.
She is really a safe place ❤
That's a real fucking legacy❤❤
I can't be more proud of her she's everything for us, swifties💖👑 a queen herself
Congratulations! This is without a doubt a good person to select with all the achievements she has made.
❤❤❤ love her for being a good person she is❤
Congratulations Taylor.
That shows how decadent the society is…
💜💜💜💜💜
Most camera hungry music star ever and a lame repertoire...causes cities to rearrange themselves and someone dies...the zenith of mass marketing...very nice legs
I love this!! Well deserved 🫶🏼
What a beautiful story of these women making bracelets and now it's a cultural staple in Taylordom. Whether you ❤️ her or ⛔️ her, Taylor transcends generations. She's a pretty incredible public figure.
Started listening to her in my 20s, and I'm in my 40s now, so much has changed but so much has stayed the same, this love and respect we feel for her only keep getting stronger with time, the way she shared her life with us through her music and art, and how we connected to her in moments of despair or deep sorrow, or how we laughed and danced through the happy times,  I can't say how grateful I'm for her, I marvel at her existence, such a brilliant mind and kind heart, we're so proud of you Tay
Okay so now real women can't be called woman of the year. But person of the year
I think this is a good choice 👍🏿 love or hate Taylor she’s been dominating 2023 so it does make sense. I do like her  not just for her music but she seems to be a good person and really loves her fans which is cool 😎 so congrats 🙌🏿 & God bless. ❤❤
Congratulations Taylor! So well deserved!!!❤
She makes Disney channel music
As much as I love her music and sweet person, I disagree with her values. She wears clothes that shows a crack of her vagina and butt in a sexual manner in vigilante shit. I think she is no longer a good role model. It is not right when you have kids there.
taylor legend best artist of ALL TIME
our angel
Absolutely ridiculous. Totally ridiculous. You’re not even in the same stadium as Michael Jackson.
There is only one Person who deserves 'Person of the Year' and He alone deserves it every year. He is the Lord Jesus Christ.
LEGEND!!
Omg so preppy
I named my third born daughter after Taylor 💖 she's got wild curly blonde hair and bright blue eyes and lives to perform and wear sparkly princessy clothes and she absolutely loves Taylor Swift!
Personally, I think the good people of Alabama during the sweet tea party would've been a much better choice or even the folks of Hawaii but T.I.M.E proves that they are just like the Grammy's. If you have enough money, you can buy popularity, you can buy records sales, and you can buy good P.R. Congrats on showing us that almost anything can be purchased!👍😒👍
Cillian Murphy was right there
Something big is going to happen in 2024 involving Taylor Swift.
HOW I LOVE TAYLOR ❤ SHE HELPED ME A LOT, IM SO GREATFULL TO LIVE IN THE WORLD TAYLOR’S VERSION ❤
She is still Bejeweled!
she is the man.
...ok.
hur musik is wack!
ONCE AGAIN CLOWNINGGG
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
TAYLOR you are AMAZING! Thank you for helping me shine!!!!!
I usually don’t comment on Social Media. I didn’t attend a real live concert until at age 32 (Dua Lipa at MSG, March 2022). My parents forbidden me not to go to any of these events because they’re uneducational and very expensive. When I was very depressed after divorce, I knew that I desperately needed to meditate myself and be happy again. Also being a Muslim, I’ve always follow the religious beliefs and practices. Initially, I was reluctant to purchase the Taylor Swift concert in the Meadowlands once it was on sale because it was way too expensive and Ticketmaster crashed like everyone else. A couple months later, going to stubhub then BINGO. There was a seat (center upper deck) appealed to me, and also I knew that this was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Witnessing this in person was so emotional that this will stick with me for the rest of my life 🥹.
omg the hat designer segment had me bawling, it's even more special than we knew
Oh, YEAH!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
the man who gave everyone notes asking them to record at LA made me SOB. That's so sweet
ITS GIVING REP
Does anyone know when it’s on stands ??
Well deserved
Can she bring her cats?
im so proud of her🩷
She just makes everyone happy.
Been somewhat of a Taylor fan since Debut, but not a Swiftie until Reputation. This year has been so different, she always got so much hate and honestly still kinda hard for me to get used to, but I love it. I love you Taylor!
Tell me this is reputation without telling me this repuatation ❤❤❤
Is this a reputation taylor version hint.  Those photos !!!!!
Congratulation my baby 🥰
The Eras tour film was my first experience being surrounded by other Swifties and it was absolutely incredible!!!! It was more then dancing and singing. Everyone was trading bracelets and making sure those without them got some. I had a couple of girls that saw me sitting dancing in my seat alone pull me up into their group to join in. There was a young girl in a wheelchair sitting in the front and everyone took turns including her in their dancing and singing groups as well. I have never been in a room full of strangers and felt so at home. That was Taylor does for us. She reminds us through her songs and through fellow fans that we are not alone. I'm proud to call myself a Swiftie and can't wait to see what Taylor gives us next! (REP TV Whenever your ready Blondie 😉)
Yass queen
Taylor deserves all of it ❤️
Wow !!!! That was beautifullll thank you Time Magazine for making it a story of the People 💗💗💗... I would love if they could make it a documentary of all the ins and outs of how Taylor Swift's tours and life in general impact all the people around her !!!! The truckers, the dancers, the costume designers, the back-up singers, the band, all the people who work for her, the fans !!!! That would be an idea for a grand documentary ✨✨✨ Just like this one but 2-hours long :)
Wow this was so well put together. Doing a story on Taylor through the people who were impacted by her is so sweet and genius. I cried watching and I’m not even a diehard Swiftie 💕 but man I love what she’s done for her fans
What an example of how pathetic this country has become to choose an entertainer as person of the year instead of somebody that has done good for the country, the world....Should have picked somebody that has done good for humanity, science, the environment, shown leadership for peace.....  Nope, instead pick somebody that all they are is an entertainer.  Societies morals and virtues are in the sewer.
Yeahhhh!! Taylor Swift ✨❤️ She so deserve it. Thank you Times Magazine. Well done 🇺🇲
Congratulations! Taylor
We stan a QUEEN, so well deserved, Taylor!!! <3
Gosh
Very very deserving, she should be the person of the year worldwide, she helped the world economy a lot
this is so rep coded
She will be elected President of the United States next year 😜. We're lucky she's a peaceful person, because she could kill us all if she wanted to. That's how powerful she is 😁.
OMG, you interviewed the security guard! Awesome.
THE MUSIC INDUSTRY
Not surprising.  She just recently vowed to rally her fans against Trump.  That's all it takes, apparently.
I love the stories
I am a big fan of Taylor Swift
Great that they picked Taylor.                                                                                                                                                                                                     She seems like such a nice down to earth person from what I have seen.
This is why I love being a Swiftie. I love Taylor swift so much. She’s been someone I can turn to and feel  connected with her music. I’ve never met her, but I always feel like I’ve known her because it’s true. She tells stories through her music and it’s so powerful. She’s always gonna be an inspiration to me ❤️
times person of the year when russia invaded ukraine vs when israhell is committing literal genocide against Palestinians
Person of the Year — TALK ABOUT REPUTATION!!!!!!
me watching this while bawling bc everyone is so cute
When will this issue be out??????
Perhaps she will finally make a significant philanthropic impact somewhere, now that she is a billionaire.
Fascinaring how almost all of these are "look how much money people made thanks to Taylor". Love her or hate her, she's confirming how she's the epitomy of an American (capitalist) hero
2023 IS HER YEAR
Wonderful. So well-deserved. 🎉 Streaming Taylor December 13 for her birthday ❤️ Stunning, creativity, artistry and work ethic. Congratulations.
YESSSS. CONGRATULATIONS TAYLOR.
congrats Taylor.  so proud of u.  I'm a 60 year old retired usher at Levis stadium in Santa Clara, California, and I became a swiftie this past summer.  after ushering my section for back to back nights back in July, I just realized nobody is bringing this much joy and happiness to people's lives.  Not to mention, complete strangers just giving me friendship bracelets.  .... spreading the love.  Let's face it, the world needs more of Taylor' vibe.  personally, I am so tired of all the haters, wars, negativity ..... we all need to lighten up, and feel the beauty, love, and great vibes of a Taylor Swift concert.  I've been converted.
Simplesmente a maior.
Congratulations Taylor! So well deserved.❤
So they honor someone who sold her soul to the devil. So many reasons I won't read a Time magazine. You support what you love.
All the great contributions she made to humanity, Guess I missed those
I’m so proud of Taylor, all of the fans new and old. Its literally not just about music, its how she affects our lives. Emotion is such a big thing to all of us, and Taylor recognizes every emotion. Best days, worst days…we’ll always have her 🩵
Not me sobbing into my salad as I sit here having lunch while watching this. Thanks, Time!😭
I saw her in hannah montana movie n being a swiftie ever since n being a  writer dreaming to be featured in a magazine like Time . This is 🥹🥹🥹🥹
If its musical success to be the defining factor,why not John Bongovi ? But Hes more.He also is a great humanitarin,married his high school sweetheart and opened a restaurant where you pay what you can and the profit goes to the needy.😊
🩵🩵🩵
Followed her since I was little, I'm so proud and I think every Swifties are also very proud of her and her accomplishments to this date. Almost 2 decades and she just kept breaking records.
This year has been a hard one for many all over the world, and I believe her music helped a lot of them, as it helped me through my problems. Wish her the best🤞
the most deserved person PERIOD. the way she has the world in a chokehold – not just the US, I'm writing this from Europe – and insipires sooo many people, especially young people, to do good and embrace life in its purest forms, is really beautiful and extremely important in this environment. she is basically my English teacher, makes up 90% of my playlists and has made me more excited for a single event than I have ever been in my life – talking about the concert of course. if we have to pick ONE person that had the biggest impact on the music industry in a long time – it's Taylor. sooo proud to have followed her for more than a decade now <3
WOWOWOOWOW YESSSS
Regardless of whether or not you’re a Swiftie, we can’t deny the impact that Taylor has in pop culture. The last time we saw this kind of mania around a musician was probably MJ. She’s accomplished so much, but stays humble and tries her best to be a positive influence. Her fans r unstoppable. Congrats to her.
🥹❤️
Mother is mothering 🫶
Reputation TV is coming… 🔥🔥🔥
The palestinians should be the person of the year
Taylors legacy is glorious

Congratulations 👏 The Music Industry 💪 Taylor Swift ❤❤❤
🔥💕
Congratulations Taylor Swift! 😍
Congratulations Taylor. Honesty, transparency, doing the right and just things, caring for people.  Now 76 years old, thank you for your giving spirit!
I am so happy for her. She really is the best human possible for being the person of the year! ❤❤
This should help Time magazine sell a few copies of their magazine, if they still sell them lol
OMG
no one's surprised
Wonderful! Been a Swiftie since 2008 and it feels like we've grown up together, been through heartbreaks and sad moments together. She is just a genuinely kind and giving person which makes her so incredible. I love Taylor Swift and am proud to be a part of this generation that loves her. ❤
Taylor Swift is a bright light for so many of us. She is fantastic! Taylor is very deserving for person of the year. Woo Hoo!
Countdown to trump saying it should have been him🤮
taylor swift has raised a generation and she deserves this award a million times over
How old is she?  ❤❤
Well Done Taylor! Congrats! 🥂 To your continued success and happiness! ❤
Taylor & Beyonce saved the world!! ❤❤
Someone at Time must have been bribed with a lot of money for this nonsense . This is their Person of the  Year? ???  Is Time saying there is not one else in the world that made contributions to help humanity other than Taylor Swift??  We are in big trouble. The reality is Ms Swift is a medicare singer. Just like Justin Bieber  their management, public relations people  can turn a mediocre performer into a  so called Super Star where  the naive public are brainwashed..
OMG I LOVE THIS EEEEEEKKKK
REPUTATION is coming 🖤🐍✨
queen of our hearts. she never goes out of style.
I heart her, Taylor, the outcome from her legacy is incomparable.
No doubt she is the most successful and kind person of the decade 🤩
Congratulations, Taylor, well deserved. I adore you and all your music. You are phenomenal.
Is it just me pr does the photoshopt giving very much Reputation
The most incredible part of Taylor’s current massive success is that she’s been patiently cultivating it for almost 20 years. Her critics have been minimizing her whole career as nothing but an artist making music for moody teenage girls, and instead of pulling back, she leaned in and started releasing her most poppy catchy music for those critics, while keeping her most heartfelt and personal songs locked in her albums, just for her and her fans to bond over as they navigate life together.  I think her current critics still believes her fandom spontaneously increased and got diverse this year, when the truth is, it’s always been this diverse and steadily increasing for almost 20 years, but it’s not until now that they are forced to acknowledge everything she’s been building during that time, and how those original “teenage” fans have grown with her, and are now part of a multigenerational fan base as diverse as the general public, and that’s something that’s no longer possible to ignore.
Bro I’m crying at work because of this vid 😭
minha mãe
She was one of the few people left on this sorry planet bringing people together. Everyone else was looking to fight.
Watching this  Made me realize how much she has done for so many people this year  Taylor  I love you mama  Thank you for getting me through life altogether
Great choice!! Im getting the 3 copies!!
She looks racist 🤭
ROFL - they blew it again, but it was predictable.  My vote is with the Doctors attempting to treat patients in unfathomably dangerous conditions in Palestine and the Palestinian people.
WELL DESERVED!!!!!!
Without a doubt
It had to be Taylor, 2023 has been Her year
So freaking proud of her 🥺🥺🥺  Been her fan since the Fearless era like seeing her grow when she went through so many hardships ..  i can't express how much i am genuinely happy for her as if like she is my very own family
Thank you, TIME, for making Taylor Swift the Person of the Year. I absolutely love Taylor and her music. I wouldn’t say I’m in her demographic. I’m a 53 year old, Hispanic truck driver, living in Minnesota. I was blessed to get tickets for her Night 2 Minneapolis show. It was incredible. It made me happy to see her fans dress up and get so excited when she appeared on stage. It was an amazing, once in a lifetime event, and I’m so happy I was able to go. I hope I get to see her again the next time she come up here ❤
Queen!
My queen❤
there goes the proudest woman this town has ever seen
Love Taylor
congrats
Swift  and eras NFL
Taylor Swift, a true singing goddess full of love…and class—no tattoos, no piercings! 💕☮🌎🌌
#Swifties … celebrate Taylor (&Travis) ❤ their love story https://youtu.be/sn_0SRIxKGI?si=Ns2F7QKSinFUmvEf
beautiful, talented, intelligent and mindful.  Great choice.  And this is coming from a Grandfather.
Im crying rn
I just love her so much!  Her success makes me cry tears of joy as if she's my best friend forever (which she absolutely is, she just doesn't know it yet)  That's the power of Taylor swift ladies and gentlemen the one and only artist in the world who makes people feel seen and heard ❤
Couldn’t agree more! ❤
Congratulations TS…
Well, she should be
She will be always the moment
Congrats TS!
2023 has been Taylor's year.  Big sister proud. ❤
It is her year
I’m so incredible proud of her. She deserves everything beautiful in this world. Congratulations queen 💕
growing with her, from her debut album to midnights to re-records has been just as much my journey of life as it has been her. we really did go through everything together and her music really does help me calm myself during panic and anxiety attacks.
She deserves this award and so much more for all her hard work and dedication to her fans God bless you Taylor you are a true hero in my heart
Imagining Travis having a  special designed    "Trav ❤️Tay" friendship bracelet made for her for their first Christmas💞
Do nothing draft dodger donnie will pitch a fit. Lets see him spin this.
La industria de la musica Señores. World domination Taylor's Version
TIME was once a well respected institution.
This video is so heartwarming 😭🥹
A security guard that is more interested in being famous than protecting his subject is a problem.
Remember - Taylor urges her fans to VOTE (BLUE)!
i cannot think of anyone better for the title.  she has influenced the entire world and sprinkles generosity and love everywhere she goes.  she serves this 10 fold.  The under dog gone BADASS BOSS BABE.
I’m so happy!
mother is mothering hard !!!!! congrats Tay !!
"haters gonna hate" makes more sense each passing day. congrats Tay you deserve it
Queen is giving and slaying again✨
❤
I will still say Maruti Swift>>>>Tailor
Deserved 🥹🫶
The fact she has custom hats that she gives out at every concert. I mean, she puts so much money into each show!  You definitely get what you pay for with one of her shows!  ❤
I'm so proud and Happy for Taylor!✨🩷🙌🏼 We love you Tay🫶🏼
Been a swiftie since I was 10 and I’m 23 now. I’m in awe of her and what she has accomplished. Her music is a lifelong friend. I’m so happy the public perception of her has finally shifted and she can bloom.
“She’s an icon, she’s a legend, and she is the moment… Come on now.”
“Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, showstopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it”
Amoo
No need to question this. Period. T.S. The Industry
I see Trav  proposing to Tay by surprise appearance on stage at one of her concerts 🎉❤😊
*I m not surprised by this but definitely feeling very proud of her and myself for being a swiftie for yrs. She has been in news all around the world for her eras tour, and trust me i don't think any artist who has same fame as her is as humble, down to the earth and kind like her. Words wont be enough to describe her but one thing is for sure, she's the Queen of Music industry and will be forever*
Well deserved
As it should be
she's the person of the century let's be honest
We are sooo proud of our queen and God Mother! Congratulations Taylor!
Mother Taylor made this year so much better! She fueled 2023 with happiness, music, love and power with the era’s tour and her two re-recorded albums. She made a global impact everywhere even including economics, the music and movie industry and even sports too. Taylor swift is a powerhouse and a goddess. I’m so happy for her 💜
Yea!!! You deserve it girl.
Taylor Swift becoming a billionaire, having the biggest tour on the planet, getting a man, and being named Person of the Year all in 2023 is literally insane.  How can I be so proud of someone who literally doesn’t know I exist?
soOoOOoooOoOOoOoooo beautifully incrediblely mesmerizingly amazingly talented Women she is💜 kneel down to the Queen 👑🛐 She deserve every best thing in this world 🌎 so happy 🫶🏻 This video is so beautiful..i cried😭 Thank you TIME💜 ILOVEYOUTOTHEMOONANDSATURNTAYLOR🌙 🪐PLEASE COME TO INDIA 😭
She is an icon, and gives hope to many, that's the simple truth...x
Very special piece. And Ohmygosh, her philanthropic areas: please highlight those next.
She’s an absolutely stunning performer. Saw the tour in April as my first concert ever, and I had a blast. She has a knack for writing incredibly catchy songs, and her music spans across at least 3 genres. She’s extremely versatile and intelligent.  Bravo, Taylor. 🧡
This was a long time coming and a no brainer!! Shes so influential anf yet still manages to stay humble!! Our mother 100% deserves this!! ❤💜💛🩵🙌👏🫰🫶
they gotta have someone to fit the standard of "normal" shes radio music.
Am I the only one sobbing in here?
Whether you like her or don’t like her, you’ve gotta admit…she has a significant impact on our culture🩵
Thiese photos are so REP coded
Karma :)
Thanks TIME!!! You made the right decision!
Congratulations Taylor you deserve it. Blessings on you and never change.
Totally deserved! She changed music industry, her influence impacted every part of the world 💯❤️
I'M NOT CRYING, YOU'RE CRYING
Why am I crying???!!??? <3 <3
I am happy for her. She deserves it. She is amazing. Love her.
Great job Time Magazine, she is perfect to name as person of the year
I'm a BIG FAN of TAYLOR SWIFT  AND I'M  From KUALA LUMPUR MALAYSIA..🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾  #Swiftie i Love u Taylor Swift...
Rock on Taylor!!! ❤❤❤
Dasurrv❤
Hate her or love her she dominated this year she had two #1 albums, three #1 hits, her daily streams are +100M and that’s on Spotify only, her concert film is the highest grossing concert film in history opening with +100M, and had the highest grossing tour OF ALL TIME
I saw the person of the year.
Overrated
Everything going on in this world and all they could find is a grown child with a boyfriend addiction ??? Now I see why time magazine is no longer  relevant.
TIME is not being stupid! Imagine all the money they are going to make when all these Swifties buy their magazine this edition. Taylor is a cash cow right now. So they hopped on the band wagon to get their piece of the meat pie. Had it been a real person of the year, only a few sales. It's all about the money.
I just read your article, and it is phenomenal. Great work!
Goes to show you time magazine is no longer relevant.
I’m so proud of Taylor, she started a whole new generation of kindness I’m a swiftie myself and I love her so much ❤  I feel like I’m gonna cry 😭 Taylor, I love you 💕 Edit: thanks for all the likes
❤Her year in everything and ❤love ofcourse ❤
Taylor truly is the sunshine for lots of us during this dark times
It's giving reputation TV 😭
Congratulations Taylor, you deserve this so much!!! Saw you on night 2, in Minneapolis, and get to see you at another Swiftieappolis next year, and we get to bring the kids this time! Best show of a lifetime, thanks for being so amazing!
The Kelce Effect 🏈 🏹
I LOVE U TAYTAYAYAYAYYAAYAYA
Having been a Swiftie since 2008, this is so incredible to see. Getting to take my sister to the Eras Tour in Kansas City for her birthday and see her completely fall apart from hearing Last Kiss as a surprise song (The song mentions her birthday, July 9th), is one of the most unforgettable moments of the summer for me. Also the picture she had someone behind us take of the two of us doing heart hands during the show perfectly captured the essence of that entire night. A night that I will never fully recover from.
As i was expected 👏👏👏👏
Take that @kimkardashian.
Her lyrics make me physically cringe. Kpop is worse than Taylor Swift. Swifties and sigma males should be deported.
Congratulations My Queen! 👑💙❤️🧡💛💚💜🤎🖤🤍
so deserving. once in a lifetime artist.
So Beyonce doesn't exist????
Well deserved!  I love how she has used her influence to encourage young people to register to vote and to actually vote!
Taylor swift is the best artist ever😊
Person of the year ( basically 90 per cent of the planet doesnt know who she is )
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰💅
As usual the most beautiful music superstar ...
THE PHOTOS DEFINITELY SCREAM REPUTATION!!!!
THE PHOTOS DEFINITELY SCREAM REPUTATION!!!!
she must be so happyy
Her impact this year is INSANE. Absolutely deserved, so proud to be a swiftie seriously❤
Hello 🛵 and JB an the rest of the bullies
Taylor Swift is the Earth's person of the year tbf
Taylor's young fans adore her and will grow up to be the next generation's stars influenced by her so much.🎉❤😊
So well deserved. Taylor is the best 😁
Taylor has been named the 5th Most Powerful Woman in the world by Forbes!  "Most notably, Taylor Swift’s dramatic rise from #79 to #5 epitomizes a new archetype of influence, signaling a shift from the traditional political and corporate might, and that far transcends traditional entertainment boundaries. Her economic impact this year is staggering: the Eras tour alone is reported to have brought in a record-breaking $850 million, and is estimated to have boosted the U.S. economy by over $5 billion. Her innovative business strategies have redefined industry norms.  Yet Swift’s most profound impact lies in her ability to sway the cultural and social currents of our time, particularly among a young, predominantly female audience. She symbolizes a new era of power, influencing people and culture independent of any country or company."
clones and drones.  thankful  i’m neither.! 😉😀😆  ✌🏻🇦🇺🌏🤘🏻
Taylor looks absolutely stunning in the pictures! Well deserved, its truly been her year!
What is actually the reasoning for winning Time Person of the Year because for the last 20 years it’s gone to lots of horrible political leaders who killed millions like Putin and Obama but now we give it to a pop star who didn’t even make any stand for human rights or anything like that, I don’t get it. She had a great year and had a very successful tour but that’s hardly the greatest thing anyone has done in the past year? Even with celebrities I’d have Lionel Messi, Margot Robbie and Cillian Murphy above her for what this year will be remembered for but to each their own
She truly deserves this. I can not wait for her to come to Sweden in 2024! I am sooo excited 😍  I had multiple panic attacks waiting in line for tickets in July and thank god I got mine! There were three dates for my arena and all of them were sold out in less than 4 hours and that is crazy 🔥 she truly is the music industry WORLDWIDE! 😍
Taylor Swift ❤
Taylor Swift has been the Joy of 2023.
love her
😂😂😂😂😂
An amazing human being.  An amazing life. Well deserved Time’s Person of the Year. Congratulations, Taylor!
As she should, the impact she's had this year is immeasurable
You should use #Taylor Swift
A pure grace
It makes sense
Laughable 😂😂😂 but what can you expect from the magazine which chose Hitler as their person of the year
well deservd
Embarrassing... when you charge $200 for your concert tickets making little girls desperate to go to your concerts and making them feel insignificant or not enough for not being able to afford a ticket or travel to see her. With all the shit going on in the country and in the world this is embarrassing Times magazine. When are we gonna stop idolizing wealth and start teaching our young girls that being smart being a philanthropist being kind those are the things to value and to idolize. This is embarrassing smh
Icon ! Most streamed artist in the history!
Any Swifty here❤
What a joke.
The Most Streamed Artist of the Year The Best Selling Artist of the Year The Most Googled Artist of the Year The Most Influential Artist of the Year The Most talk-about Celebrity of the Year The Biggest Concert Movie of ALL TIME The Highest-Grossing Tour of ALL TIME  The One and Only Taylor Swift!
🎉🎉🎉🎉 Taylor ❤
Good choice!  And I’m NOT a Swifty.
She deserves it. She writes composes playing instruments and sings. She’s the real deal! And the eras tour is amazing!
We love you Taylor! 🫶 Thank You for it all!
🤢🤢🤮
What does it mean?
what a joke
