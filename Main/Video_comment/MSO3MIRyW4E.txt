This commentator should be doing the waltzers.
NO maguire,sterling kane BOOS...
I'm just laughing at all these comments that are about Maguire
My Overoverovergod
If nuer was the goalkeeper he would have clean sheets
Maguire & Dier. The universal duo. You have one of the world’s best attackers… and then you have Maguire and Dier at defense…marvelous combination.
maguire is so talented that he can play for both sides in the pitch
Stegen (neur) - rudiger(Tah) - shlotterbeck (hummels) - raum (anthony jung) - Hector jonas(ginter) - kimmich (gundugan)- goretzka (brandt) - Muller (werner)- musiala(gotz) - Reus (sané)- havertz(fullkrug) BVB 2013 Mercedes
Don't blame Maguire he has to face musiala

Southgate is badass coach, always playing with 10 against 12 on pich.😮
When I grow up I want to be like Harry Maguire ❤️ 🐐
2 golazo
Jamal musiala 🥶
Maguire es un talento tan puro que ayuda a todos a marcar
Siempre Alemania grande Alemania siempre Alemania grande Alemania siempre Alemania grande Alemania 👏 💪 ⚽ 🙌 👍 💙 👏
At the end, if it was rash and not saka he is smashing that in all day long
We need more defenders like Maguire 🥺
Even with the economic Inflation😩 I got a $10,000 returns from my $3000 investment every 15 days  and I'm so happy right now 😊
Kneeling rainbow england tw ts!
We gave you a friendly to learn how to play again, bring it to the world cup would ya!
Hallo, ich bin Christoph Klein, meiner Meinung nach ist ein 3:3 Unentschieden nicht schlecht, natürlich hätte ich mir als Deutscher gewünscht, dass Deutschland gewonnen hätte, ich bin trotzdem zufrieden mit der deutschen Mannschaft, das muss ich sagen Maguire hat ein phänomenales Spiel gemacht, na liebe Grüße aus Berlin.
Maguire is the best player in the world right now. Pure class and calmness hahahaha!
Why can't Havertz and Mount be this good in Chelsea?
Maguire is such
Why is no one talking about the fact that Germany bottled a 2-0 lead? Ik Maguire is terrible, but Germanys defense wasn't great either.
Maquire out tomori in

this commentary is unbearable
Maguire The man
How is the Schlotterbeck one a penalty he got to the ball and followed the movement.
Saka sucks….lol
Thanks YOU Havertz
"The Chelsea man with a world class finish"~Kai Havertz ❤️🇩🇪
Porque a narração desse pessoal é tão sem emoção, ele nem grita o gol
Ka re sala goodbye machikne❓👣👣🔱👣🙏
Schlotterbeck really weird 🤡🤡🤡
Maguire is the Kick of Death for any team of players he plays with... Overrated,and Overpaid....
a good final for the world cup

"A goal is a goal,doesn't matter on which side you score" - Lord Maguire
Maguire is such a pure talent, he helps everyone to score
Maguire!! Maguire!! Maguire!! Maguire!! Maguire!! Maguire!! Maguire!! WE WANT MORE Maguire!! Maguire!! Maguire!! Maguire!! Maguire!! Maguire!!
Germany needed to get Maguire more on the ball !!
I HAT FOOTBALL
Nice
Wow such a good game 😁
Wao kren
👌🙌👏
Why is the commentator pretending he's reacting live at times and then recapping it later like he's bored. It's odd.
Maguire at fault for the 1st two goals. Shaw (and maybe the CB next to him with the dark boots) at fault for the third goal.    Surprise surprise two players who have been successfully dropped at club level to improve their teams form and yet Southgate just picks them and expects good results from it.
Manc rat, Maguire is.🐁
Aaron Ramsdale should be the starting goalkeeper
Hary maguire sangat menakutkan untuk kiper Inggris
what a game got goosebumps eveytime they kick to the goal. close game.
Thank you Maguire for contributing to the victory of Germany!
Kai ok
Maguire coming in clutch for Germany 🙌
Second german goal, what is maguire doing??? Trying to play goalie???
hoá ra Harry mắc woai cũng làm hề ở đội tuyển... xét theo góc độ chuyên nghiệp thì đúng là thảm họa.... mà theo cách nhìn của cđv thì.... mắc woai nên về nhà đeo tạp dề và uống lọc đá 😆

ha englan pasti menang
Maguire is just not good enough, plain and simple.... I know a lot of people that put the price on his head want more, but he is just a 15 mil player at best. Let's just face it.
give it a chance Marc-André ter Stegen

Lord Don Maguire the ultimate false 5, new age defender.
All these Maguire haters need to get a life seriously
Maguire
Saka changed the game after coming on as second half substitute
The camera angle from that side is so weird as I'm so used to the camera being at the other side
Maguire is such a pure talent. He can plays in both of them
A surprise Discovery showing now on Just Judez channel...
England manager stupid.because miguare no can play is game foot ball .where you have think manager.
Hari migure no good play game football.👎👎👎🤮🤮
Love the Germany Jersey
Kebiasaan lord Maguire hmm
Maguire wkwkkw
Harry maguare brilliance 🔥🔥🔥
Why always maguire?
Wonderful match from both sides 👏🏻 👌🏻 👍🏻 😊
England would do better to play with just 10 men than have Slabhead in defence
Nick Pope? where is Pickford?
Pope's fumble was like Joe harts fumble against Iceland euro 2016 round of 16
Racist Maguire still playing for England??
Maguire he's only player in the world he can play as a defender and goal score assistant same time
Well done Havertz and ur teams f*ks the brits

Nation league useless cup
What a penalty
Nature is such a wonder in maintaining the balance of things! You have Messi, Ronaldo etc being some of the best in the world on one end. And then there is Maguire on the other!
If your house worth 1m, your 1% insurance premium is a for sure loss to hedge against catastrophic loss of property  That same 10k if put in Terra Luna Classic is NOT a 100% certain loss because it’s not an insurance fee or obligation.  Yet it provides more upside than a hedge against missing out on a 1m dollar profit. The asset can go higher than 100x up.   And with greater probability than a house fire occurring
the real assist : HARRY MAGUIRE
Maguire is a gift from the gods, just not the football one's
I'm surprised no one's mentioned Maguire yet.
SACK MAGUIRE AND SOUTHGATE
Great come back from England but a disgrace that they can't play like that from the off. Southgate has forgotten what the game is about.
horrible
If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.   (1 John 1:10)
No Maguire win3-2
This is best moment for England have a maguire... he's so kind to help the rival get a score
Maguire no control football
useless maguire
Hi
Germany really has to work hard on defense! The World Cup is getting closer and there is no time for you to squander your chances of winning.
Saka one of the most overrated players all time.
Maguire bloon
I don't know how every coach is very trust with maguire, it's absolutely make never sense 🤣🤣
Havert 😇

Havertz is hard
thing is why does United and even England football keeps playing Maguire after these silly mistakes?  ps:, im not much into football
Maguire to opposition’s attack : “ You’ll never walk alone”. 🫡
damn man, like for real what is happening to maguire... it's not as drastic as what happened to karius but he really is becoming a terrible player... Is it just confidence or was he never as good as people thought? Like in leicester he was pretty good as i recall...
❤Search miracles of the holy "Quran" / "Qadir khutba"!

What a match 🔥
Maguire just doing what he always does. Blame the arsehole who put him in the team!
If you have Maguire as your opponent, you are 1-0 up already.
Maguire is Man of the match in this game. No doubt
Dios santo!!! Ya esto no deberis ser demandable por parte del consumidor? Uno paga TV o entradas al estadio para ver a jugadores no a maguire
Man of the match Harry maguire
How come only Ten Haag who is sane enough to keep Maguire on bench. Ole, Ragnick, Southgate all jokes
Uncensored and Unfiltered talent from Lord Maguire 🙌🙌🙌🙌
90percent of comments here got Maguire's name 😂
Yesterday trending 1, today trending 3 🔥
Why can’t Cinderella play soccer? Because she always runs away from the ball.
🇧🇷👍👍👍👍
Just here for the comments on the Goat 😂
Imagine waking up the next day realising you're Harry Maguire..
How does Maguire keep playing in the team inspite of making such poor, basic mistakes?
🎉apreq.
Harry Maguire for PM..
Maguire has a great fool diffender 😂
Maguire has not right to be anywhere near proffesional football.
why dafaq Sterling is more expensive than Son.
Maguire is such a scapegoat. He was at fault for for the first goal but are you going to blame him for the second or third? If we're blaming players for their mistakes then why isn't Nick Pope getting any blame for the third goal?
they have ramsdale on the bench and southgate make pope start what a legend
Que risas harry  maguire...   por que no convocan a tomori

Why does the commentator almost every word by adding 'ah'. Likeah thisah.
Komennya kebanyakan muji Hary maguare 🔥
Werner's pace is really terrible
Maguire= 💩💩💩💩
good....😀
We’ll done nick pope you got the worst rating a player has ever received since the ratings came out in 2010 true fact . He got 2.6. He’s a clod hopper who cost England a victory
That england penalty was non existent , the German defender had the first touch of the ball
Southgate need to fix his team as soon as possible. England also still struggle for decent keeper…He was doing so well as manager but he’s gone back to picking the same players every match which lets him down.
England looks deadly
I'm disgusted by the way Chelsea fans are commenting here don't you think for them scoring here gives them a boost of confidence when the return. All i see is negative mentality it's not good at all guys
How bad will the commentary be: Commentator: YES
Sangat suka banget nonton videonya
maguire is bad
Maguire is just as bad as Kudela from Czech Republic .
"Mesut has nothing on maguire." -Ronaldo
I swear I always thought Maguire is not as bad as people make fun of him. But guess what, I was wrong 😢
Lord Maguire its Joke, But England's Jokes is very awesome cause choose our Lord for Nation scale 😅
You’re gonna lose, England 😄
Maguire is a scam 😂
The biggest setbacks for MANUNITED club is Maguire 😡.!!
what an awful but absolutely awful refereeing, that s absolutely dısgusting, such clear penalties both and yet he couldnt award either of them. He should not be on again ever.

Fire the commentator
Maguire memang asli anak panteeeek

It is no longer Teutonic Germany, it already seems more like a club than a German team, there is no longer any motivation to play against Germany
Maguire help Germany
Why pope not ramsdale?
CB LOL
The Lord Maguire
maguire HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAHAAHAHHAAHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
Ok bossku
Harry Maguire should get Sportman of the Year - man scores own goals and gives the opposite team penaltys. If that kind of generosity doesnt deserve awards, I dont know what does.
MVP ！Maguire. MVP ! Maguire.
Incredible permanent down, you mean. What a joke England is and so are Germany
Hey brothers a long time ago I painted two ships with halos on them everybody's been over here trying to cheat me for my money is it cool to get to the five ships my painting has halos and they had cannon balls and everything thank you Arturo Montezuma.
Maguire and mustafi are Almost same
Maquaire 🤣🤣😂😂 no words can describe his stupidity as a defender 🫣😅
Fukoff maguire
The goal from the edge the box by Germany was world class, but so was the goal by Mount world class. It's even better. Peace and love
Vamos Stegen 🧤⚽️🥅
i know Maguire is performing poorly but the jokes about him are too much at this point . no can can play good after getting trolled every single day all over the world. give a man some respect at least then maybe he can bounce back . but keep trolling and only england will suffer the rest of the world is happy about this
O.
Who is this God awful commentator ? 😂😂😂😂
Man Utd fans had the luxury of experiencing Maguire's top notch performance for the past year. Now it is the time for the world fans to enjoy Lord Maguire's art of defending in the World Cup!
Si flick cree que ésta miserable selección de alemania va a ganar la copa del mundo en qatar esta bien pendjo., da pena ver jugar a alemania, yo soy fan de la seleccion teutona y me da mucho coraje ver jugar a zane, werner y otros se sienten muy sobrados sólo salen a caminar en la cancha, les hace falta un chingo para estar a un buen nivel. Ojalá y lo que se ve en éstos partidos sólo sea preparación y q ya en el mundial sí jueguen a todo
Saka was the source of all these 3 goals that England score, but maguire is also the source of 3 goals England conceded🤣😂
Sang Maestro Mujaer emang luar biasa...  Pemain titipan Pemprov Wakanda

Hope pope is injured for every England game in the future
The Chelsea Stars are making it😆
Maguire is so good when he plays you are guaranteed to see goals.. (GIVEN)
Anybody else think the commentator sounds like MC Grindah from People Just Do Nothing?
1. English media over hyping maguire for playing so average 2. Maguire gets picked by national team 3. Maguire playing bad 4. English media backslash him so much      What's going on?
so Sane had to get a conk in order to get capped?....the more things change, the more things stay the same
해리케인 페널티살아났네
Give Maguire peace
Camera angle is different from the live match
Maguire plays for MU and Englands and earns millions of pound per year. This pile in on maguire a joke. Jealousy
Maguire is like Eeyore. The donkey we all love.
All the comments about Maguire, the Best defender

Lord Maguire 😂😂🙏🏾
Messi finnesing long shots, Maguire outchea finnesing whole-ass Managers!!!😂😂😂💔
WHEREVER MARGUIRE WILL BE, THERE'RE GOALS.
2:39 The definition of bad technique... that would have been a 1vs1 with the goalkeeper but he can't even control the ball properly to save his life.
Forza Wonderful. Blessing from God.

Maguire is pure class
Southgate is genius…seriously. Look at how he can still slot Maguire in.
Maguire needs to try WWE with ronda rousey. Or See if any circus can accommodate the clown
Maguire is such a talent, he plays extremely consistently, even when he is on the bench or sitting at home looking after the kids he has the same affect on games
Ingris mampus
Qué fea playera de alemania!
Maguire GOAT 😂😂
La famine et la guerre sur le point d'arrivée en Europe, de Poutine viendra le chaos et ils complet bientôt cette paroles (il y aura de grands tremblements de terre, et, en divers lieux, des pestes et des famines; il y aura des phénomènes terribles, et de grands signes dans le ciel. LUC 21:11), seul le Nom de Jésus-Christ sauve Rom 10.13 "Car quiconque invoquera le nom du Seigneur sera sauvé". Dieu vous aime, il vous aime tellement, et il a payer un prix très très grand pour vous, il vous a donné la vie et tout ce quelle renferme, chercher le de la manière que vous le souhaitée, parler lui il vous donneras, chercher le vous le trouverez, demandez et il vous donneras, il a donné son fils unique Jésus Christ en sacrifice pour que vous accéder a sa présence (Jean 14.16) et il ne souhaite que vous rencontre, il vous connait et il sait qui vous étiez, il est avec vous pour l'éternité, vous serait le plus heureux du monde si vous trouvé Dieu dans votre vie, je souhaite vraiment que vous le découvrir et qu'il comble votre cœur tout entier, par son unique Fils Jésus-Christ, mort pour nous, que l'amour de Dieu vous inonde, et il ne veux que personne périssent dans son péché, sa désobéissances envers Dieu car cela vous fera porter la peines de vos crimes devant Dieu alors que Jésus-Christ a porter toute la peines de toutes vos faute Passer, Présent et Futur, car son sang innocent verser par les hommes a effacée pour nous ABSOLUMENT TOUTES FAUTE, et si vous n'avez pas crue et accepter ce pardon donné gratuitement a tous, alors la colère de Dieu vous sera remis a la fin de votre vie et vous aurez pour salaire, le rejet de Dieu et de son royaume pour l'éternité et vous n'aurez plus de par a la vie dans l'au delà car votre esprit ne sera pas bon a cause de toute vos faute commise sur terre, elle régiront et vous serait souillée et en horreur a Dieu, et ce, peut importe vos faute, ne vous y trompé pas Dieu existe et toute c'est œuvre son visible sur terre (la justice, l'amour, la paix, le plaisir, et la création, etc...).

all i see is comments about maguire WTF about Blunderous nick pope......Pickford would have stopped them shots!
Is it just me or does maguire sabotage every game he plays in
Sterling is no Haaland.
[insert cringe Maguire comment here]
Chelsea and the Tottenham ran the place while Arsenal popped out lol.
Trent is better defender than Maguire.
MAGUEREE OUTT
Another great performance from Maguire 🤣🤣🤣
The new Germany kit is so nice
😀
I’m not sure if you guys are trolling or serious about Maguire so let me watch these highlights 😂
Reading comments, it looks like Harry Maguire is very popular in Germany! For all the wrong reasons 😂😂😂
classic
Mujaer ini gk di EMYU gak di timnas...jadi BEBAAAN teroos
Pope fat fingered it
Can anyone place this commentator's accent geographically? I can't separate his accent from just over-enunciating for dramatic effect.
Pope shouldn't start for England over Ramsdale
Havertz is king
Maguire🤡🤡🤡
A very strong and enjoyable match between two ancient teams 😍❤🇩🇪🛠🇳🇱🔥
For God so loved the world, That He have His only begotten son, so that whosoever believes in Him would be saved. (John 3:16, Bible). We have all broken God’s moral law and have gotten the death penalty. However, Jesus lived a perfect life in order to take our place and endure the wrath of God. He did this because He loves us so much! Repent from sin and trust in what Jesus did for you so your sins can be forgiven and forgotten. <3
8 or 9 out of every 10 comments are about how incredibly gifted Maguire is, gifted in gifting the opposition a goal. 😆
mount and kai goal 😍
this video is trending YouTube number one in Indonesia .
What an unbelievable game
That's why him: Maguire
He’s at it again. A liability. Who does he play for ??
players on the picth playing with no confidance Maguire should have even made the bench never mind a start
I don't understand why Schlotterbeck always ruins the game in the ending moment. He did the almost same thing with the same team in the 1st leg. Both in defense and attack, Germans need to improve A LOT before moving towards Qatar.
I skipped the video came for the comments and wow I am not disappointed 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  I actually feel for McGuire🤣🤣🤣
These Maguire jokes🤣🤣🤣
These sarcastic maguire quotes really make me cringe
That Havertz goal is poetry in motion 😍
'Divided by Nation, United by Lord Maguire!''
Harry Maguire is the worst defender in football history.
Comment peut-on encore titularisé Maguire en équipe nationale ?? 🤡🤡🤡🤡
Seperti biasa Lord Paduka King Mujaer berulah🗿
Why the inglishman its so very cold chest? Jaja piratas! Devuelvan lo que se robaron!
Every single comment talking about Maguire. We need to learn from him how to get more famous. Thank you for tips man
Poor guy Maguire...
Premier liga football
Germany's defense is shocking
A game as worthy as a pile of s....t. Its been a long time since ive seen a game with no tactical plan. both teams went back and forth like they where a 13-14 yr old youth team. Where is football going. I tough i was watching a tennis game. Todays coaches are not the problem. its the lack of intelligance that the players have. 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
All the HM comments shows just how low IQ football supporters really are.
Maguire has such unparalleled talent that he can play full-time on both teams at the same time on one side of the pitch!! What a guy!
Partidaso
Hery miguer goblok
Maguire is Maguire.. Still the one and only dream Center Back for the opponent, he is Maguire..
It surprises me to see him play for a whole nation and Man United. I wonder if the management of Man United and England are blind or just don’t care. Or are they bribed. He doesn’t even qualify to play for a school team. It’s just funny and annoying. I see any manager including him in his lineup as a coward and a failure.
The great Maguessi. Gareth you're turning England into a laughing stock persisting with him.
All goals scored by EPL players, LOL
How could the ref not give the German penalty in real time?? Blatant a foul as you'll see.
No one is talking about havertz goal. Hope he can play 4 chelsea like that
Maguire LOL.... Cuihhhh
Why isn’t Ramsdale in the goal? Smh 🤦🏽‍♂️
H. Maguire is overrated!!! not good enough for the  England First Team.
Camera angle was the other way round for the game last night that’s weird
maguire is a defender n striker
What a talent Harry maguire, England and Mufc is bless with talented defenders contribute 2 goals👏👏👏👏
Does anyone can explain why maguire is still in a football field, even rappresenting  his nation? Has anyone asked this to southgate?
£80 Million. Wow.
I love how everyone is blaming Maguire for everything, and i get that but.... What about the people who still taking him to the national team.. like.. for gods mercy what is wrong with these people?!!
Maguire is redefining defending. In the worst possible way.
Maguire emg pemain titipan pemda setempat🗿
We can talk about maguire all day but that commentator probably wanks to the sound of his own voice
I don't blame Maguire, if a player is out of form it's stupidity to pick him for the national team
Lil DAAD HAS A SHOW CALLED MAKE ME LAUGH 🌃😈🔥💯🌏💯🤩💯🌎🌍🤯🌏🤯😂🤣😂🤣🔥💯🌏🤯🌎😭🌎🤯🌎🌏💯🔥😂😈😂😈😈🌏🌎💯💯🌎💯🌎🤣🌏😈😂😈😂😈😂🤣🤣🔥🤣😈😈😈🤣
Maguire isn't the most expensive centre back of all time for no reason. There will be statues of him one day outside Old Trafford and Wembley.
Harry Mags and the keeper had shockers
Maguire is not a player he is a phenomenan
kane is a big empty balloon, he didn't do anything all the match, sterling better than him, but Maguire 😡😡🤦‍♂.. bye bye england in WC
Kai harvertz 1st goal is very very amazing........🙁🙁🙁
I don’t get how you people are so high on Harry Maguire. He’s not very good.
Harry I blame the forwards
1:17 What a goal he scored!The technique is sufficient,the safety is the same and the goal is more classy. The only beautiful thing from this match.
Saka needs to always start RW.
Maguire idola
Havertz, what a strike that is
Sembrava una partita di premier League
Shut your mouses and show a respect to GOAT. Even an artificial intelligence can detect a pure talent of him. He will help England to return home very first in upcoming WorldCup😂😂. Maguire is like a Zeus in Thor:Love&Thunder, also goat of nothing.
Germany messed up ...holding a 2 nil advantage.....decided to bring on one of them  in order to be all 'political' etc ...-lost the advantage  . . ..If you hadnt have brung on that f***  would have won 3 nil ...end of  . . ..  .!
Miguer kebiasaan buruk
Bobby Moore must be turning in his grave 🙄🤨...and just out of idle interest: when was the last time England conceded 7 goals in two home games?
Oh noooo....lord maguire 😁😁
But Maguire!!!
I'm here to read Maguire comments. Pure gold.
Maguire will be scoring the winning goal against the USA this WC. Final score 1-0 USA
Havertz is a very good player  We can win the World Cup if he plays this good regularly
Meguire is best thing that happen too England football
Why Mount and Havertz don't play like this for Chelsea??? 🤔
Maguire makes everyone a better player.
Maguire idiot footballer
Maguire 😥
Havertz is a baller, always been a baller, don’t be fooled by the recent Chelsea performances 🤌
When you can't get the ball, you aim for the leg.
Why always maguire**..
Everyone who sees this: You're beautiful, and never give up your dreams, you are in this world for a reason! Lots Of Life 🙏
Maguire was the best German player. Hope he stays at United for life!
After that gift to Musiala, I suspected Maguire was going to get some stick in the comments, but it's even better than I expected .. most of the comments are about him. 🤣
Bagus banget tayangannya jernih sekali
MoTM: Harry Maguire☠💀
Son  de esos  partidos  que no queres que  terminen  hoy tuvimos un  partido de MUNDIAL  con todo  y jugar  con  MAGUIRE  es tener  el enemigo  cerca e INGLATERRA que  no tiene  arquero  hace  varias  decadas  Y ALEMANIA  no tiene un  delantero de jerarquía  hace  años  este partido  fue un  deleite
"To err is human, but the feeling is divine." - Harry Maguire

Maguire you are finshed😭😭
Gas gasss
Thx, mag. Btw jersey, juverman
Maguire must have a royal family lineage. 😂
omg which side maguire are????? make me confuse....
"I never imagined how England would be without Maguire. We're the luckiest country on earth to have such a great talent like Maguire" -Gareth Southgate-
Imagine giving the ball to the opposition’s forward, then following up by fouling him in the box. That’s a travesty in your local league, but accepted on the English National team.   It’s all about image and connections, not football.
Maguire deserves a Golden Ball
HAHAHAHA STUPID ONE🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Maguire never disappoints with these artful performances. A true hero of the people…German people. agreed!
Can't wait Phil Jones to joints Maguire for World Cup
That first goal came from a Maguire error, yeah.  However, it could have been avoided had Rice shown for the ball. It would have dragged those German players wider of the ball creating the space (that was already there) for Bellingham to move into. Bellingham, as usual, is positionally nowhere to be found having vacated his zone leaving Rice isolated. Bellingham would look far better in a midfield 3 without that positional responsibility shackling him. Neither player in that midfield pairing knows how to play in the first phase. Walker’s angles are all wrong too.  Maguire is to blame but Rice and Bellingham are too. It would help Maguire if he had two midfielders capable in build up.   Pause it at 0:39 and see the obvious problems Maguire has in trying to build from the back with this midfield set up. Dier is too close, Walker gets his angles wrong, Rice doesn’t show for the ball and Bellingham has vacated his zone. It’s bad from everyone involved.
Let's shift the attention to Kia Havertz's first goal...Wow what a class from the Chelsea man
Harry maguire is pure talent
i need maguire to keep starting for MU, so he can help other 19 teams
Great player Maguire
Maguire is lagend
แมคควายอีกแล้ว
Maguire bermain buruk
Incredible Ups & Downs at Wembley | England vs. Germany 3-3 | Highlights | Men Nations League, epic match!
Aus Liebe zu Queen Elizabeths Waage. Definitiv der beste Stürmer Deutschlands war "Harry".
Maguire ber ulah 😂
Very good
just 1,5 month to Qatar this man make More comedy
Dónde está la verdadera Alemania 😥 ?
Havertz goal is a masterclass. His body language was showing his confidence before directing that curling ball into the unreachable top left corner, it's so cool. Also, the quality of this video is so good, the color of the pitch, lighting in the stadium, jerseys go so well with each other.  Commentator also has a voice suitable for this Wembley classico.
Pantesan di jalan banyak yg make jaket England.. Ternyata oh ternyata
Maguire 🔥🔥🔥
MrWorldwide (and i dont mean his giant boxy head) Harry Maguire , my man is gonna play atleast five,seven games (if they do really well) in the world cup and for 8 different teams..thats an insane feat..
The 3 lions vs German Eagles
Harry Maguire The 🐐 People need to accept he is a big part of the England team. What a genius!!!

Lord Maguire
Maguire... a classic performance from the skipper.
Maguire is such a Born talent. great moral
Maguire is a 🗑️
Maguire is real the lord Lawak...hahaha
You can't win trophies with players like Werner and his finishing and talented Schlotterbeck with too many fouls and mistakes. Wish Germany find their proper CF.
แม็กวาย ลง  เลยแพ้..เป็น.กลองหลังอะไร ช้าอืด.เกมือนเล่นบอลไม่เป็น

Maguire maguire maguire 😁😁
Awesome
" Give me Maguire and 10 planks of wood and I'll win world cup"  - Southgate
Nick pope is absolutely shocking and maguire never seems to fail
Maguire is real comedian
I guess there was no more emotional players after Messi & Ronaldo.Then God give us Maguire.Finally...  i can totally forget how Messi and Ronaldo was played.
เเกเรต เซาท์กาก
Brawo germany!!!
England’s golden generation failed to deliver at 2002&2006 WC.. England’s current generation fails to select from a phletora of talented CBs and pick Harry Maguire 👍
Stop talking about Maguire  We played one of the worst match
💪
As Chelsea fan I'm so happy after this match  Two goals (and one wonderful) for Havertz Mason goal (I hope after that match he Keep going better)  And Recce James assist  And Timo too he had a assist Great match and it's impossible to defend Maguire sorry but he can't play again, is mistake after mistake, and he tried to fixed his mistake in the penalty and he caused another goal....
Maguire blunderrr
Harry Again.. Harry Again.. man of the match..,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Chelsea 3 goals Tottenham 1 goal Man city 1 goal Ajax 1 goal
Chelsea 3 goals Tottenham 1 goal Man city 1 goal Ajax 1 goal
All hail king Maguire...

Gooool 2 de Alemania!  ¡¡ 😱😱😱!!👍
How Lucky MU have Lord Maguire
Kok bisa tranding di indonesia, ajg banget
Why it feels like penalty spot so close to keeper
Maguire 🤭 Pure tallent indeed
It’s with Chelsea where Kai and Mason draw the line in scoring 😒
Ball at your feet. No pressure from opposition. Give it away & get nutmegged. Give away penalty. -Textbook Defending
Kai havertz is smooth as silk. Tuchel waster him playing in wrong position hope he becomes class under potter
england better pray pickford is back pope was dreadful
Maguire plays for 2 teams
Maguire is fantastic player of the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ахуено
How does mcguire still start after all his mistakes? I dont get it. Please anyone explains this to me.
I don't get the point why Maguire plays dumb head
maguire amature not profesional
maguire amature not profesional
harry Maguire did harry maguire
الالمان ملوك هذا الزمان
Kane's penalty kick always makes me speechelss.
ebar Germany tem very bad bro
England minus Southgate and Maguire is a top team.
Doesn’t matter the result, England are still relegated💀
Why is Pope starting over Ramsdale?  I swear Ramsdale would've stopped 2 of those.
Havertz is class for Germany
Out of 3300 comments 3299 relate to Harry Maguire  There must be something special about him 😂😂😂
Maguire🥱🥱🤣🤣
BEST DEF + BEST COACH = AMAZING TEAM  I THING ENGLAND CAN WIN IN WC 😎
I'm sorry Gareth but playing Harry Maguire is unforgivable, unprofessional & disrespectful to the other players in his position who have started plenty of games this season. How can you start someone who can't even get in their clubs first 11? This is international football not the Dog & Duck Sunday morning league. Time to go, lad. 👍🏻
Akinfenwa>maguire
Opposite clubs love Maguire when he plays, now is opposition countries. There is no barrier in accepting him as long as you are the opposition
Maguire is the best defender for Manchester United
Why is Maguire still playing???Terence Trent-Arnold should be playing.Even Kane is overrated.Sack the Manager.
Could have won, If maguire was on the bench
L’Allemagne c’est le Bayern . Pas de victoire
What is Messi? What is Ronaldo? Maguire is the Goat!! Maguire usually scores (doesn't matter which side😅) but if he cant score he assists but if he cannot assist he is helping the oposition strikers to attack...He is a true legend..One of the greatest play maker in the world!! We want 2022 ballond d'or in Maguire's hand!!❤
Maguire trouble maker
Is nike pope too heavy?
I hate Germany..
Maguire = quality.
Tremendous narration here. Love his voice and he had me on the edge of my seat. Barry Davies,Clive Tyldesley and Co have nothing on this guy. Just wow.
A person who doesn't watch football would read the comments and genuinely think Maguire is the GOAT...
Maguire is one of the greatest defenders in football history.coz there is no one who can play for both teams!!!Maguire is the one who does this.He is a prime level player you know?
sterling,shaw and maguire are the biggest shitplayers in england
Lollll maquireee
Maguire is represent for Center Back England all time DNA😂
Maguire + Dier = Best defense in Europe 🔥🔥🔥
"on his left foot as well" clearly doesn't watch enough football
IS this commentator for real?  he gave a dragged out "err" between almost every word, how does he get the job?
All these comments about Maguire are just rude and disrespectful. He is man united captain and lead England to some good campaigns over the past few years.   He is a very good player and should not be criticised for his terrible performances over the past 2/3 years 🎣
Goalkeeper Out OUt OuT
Maguire the GOAT 🐐🔥
Germany's defending 🤮
McGuire needs to be sent back down the leagues domestically and certainly Shouldn't be in the England team full stop he's been appalling
Lawak maguire..🤣
MAGUIRE  and NOT Tomori !!!! Tomori play in the home of defence Italy .and in one of the best club in the world Ac Milan,and he's supervised by the GOAT MALDINI ,and he won the scudetto last year , all of this and he didn't play for England national team but Maguire did !!!!!
Im glad that England is the nation who has the worst footballer in the world,as a serbian im relief.
comment eh eu tator eh so eh eu annoying
Ter stegens hairline made the biggest comeback ts
Germany football team not win last three games that seems not be fit for the qadar world cup
Ah aaaaaaaaa ...  Been spending most their lives Living in a gangsta's paradise Been spending most their lives Living in a gangsta's paradise Keep spending most our lives Living in a gangsta's paradise Keep spending most our lives Living in a gangsta's paradise  Harry Maguire !!!!
Put this defender in a video gag. This will help us laugh in time of stress. Keep it up, Harry. Benny Hill and Mr Bean would have to learn from you.
This ref is so bad.
What a match
Maguire is so quick and nimble on his feet always scoring! a real Goal scoring machine for Germany!
Maguire's pitch performance keeps on diminishing each time he is given an opportunity to showcase his improvements, I think he should retire now and go for wrestling 🤣🤣🤣
Maguire is so so consistent at giving goals when needed
Maguire agba defender 😂😂😂😂
Brilliant  foothball Germany and England 3
Maguire has already become a  betting element in the gambling world. It pays cash.
maguire tấu hài từ clb lên tới tuyển 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Calm down bout Maguire already
keep the maguire comments coming guys please, im having fun
I say sorry for England, they lost 0:4 with Hungary and they have finished last in th group. Soon there will be no Nation within this team.
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Maguire - I'm lovin' it
everytime i start to feel sorry for Maguire all i need is to watch last match when he played and seeing how well he helps team to score, only the wrong team he helps ... small detail
NAIC
Maguire > Maldini
We have to give credit to Maguire for his commitment, he never disappoints ! Always there in the best of section ....
I dont know why everyone hates maguire, the man had 2 assists today... 🤷‍♂
Maguire is such an inspriting peacon. I mean if he can continueplaying  for his nations team and the top league of football, then I can do anything.
Southgate is the biggest idiot to field McGuire. England will be eliminated in the 1st round in the World Cup if this continues.
Harry Maguire looks like he's an amateur that forced himself in the team because he's the dictators son 🤣🤣🤣
Generic Maguire comment Because I'm so smart
If maguire's worth is 30 million, then i'm worth at least 100 million.
Now I know y'all into McGuire's talents but how da fawgh did the referee NOT see 2 penalties that are clear af ?!😳😱👀
Ter stegan is so ass there’s a reason neuer starts for Germany
I hope this channel naver ends and keeps spreading happiness.❤😊 This vid is already a classic I can't wait to tell my grandkids this was the greatest youtuber of my time.
Goals of the games gotta go to haverts and mount
Maguire is MOTM 🔥
🤣🤣😂😂😂 80M Maguire.. pure talent
I'm hoping Southgate keeps Maguire in the lineup against USA in the World Cup!!  Having Pope spill some howlers will be nice as well
Germany is now WORSENS even in every little and INSIGNIFICANT aspect of its existence!!!
most fan hate maguire, but Many Coach like Maguire. I think he must have Super Aura. I hope Mr Maguire can give Us alot of entertaiment.
메과이어 시발 시발 대표팀이야  ㅎㅎㅎㅎ 이거 무슨 코메디냐

Why pope over Pickford ??????
اللهم صلِّ على سيدنا محمد بعدد حسنات سيدنا محمد وعلى آله وصحبه وسلم
I see a commedian , so entertein 😁
Don't mind me, I just came to read maguire comments.
Stop having a go he is only human, or do you think he has to be perfect for every 90 minute played
It’s obvious that when you play against Maguire, keep pressing. Most coaches and managers knew this as they are forcing Maguire into mistake. ETH and Southgate should know better. Playing from the back does not suit Maguire. Leicester was a counter attack team. Not a team that went to score goals by playing from the back. That was why Maguire played better at Leicester.
Vinicius to Shaxa : 😁
It's fashionable to bad mouth Maguire, but I think people need to get behind him.
Man of the match: Maguire😂😂😂
The commentary is insufferable. Either pretend it's live and act surprised, or report in the past-tense - don't do both!
Wow, 2 players who shouldent be in the team cost England two goals. Glory glory gareth southgate
Why all comments on here copying each other for likes
🔥🔥
Maguire ia big trouble for England
Crazy game
Nice work referee..VAR did the job!!!!
Mujaer
Harry Maquire wasnt the only poor excuse of a footballer on the field last night.......feel for John Stones though......
Maguire proving ten hag wrong hes miles above veran and martinez
Maguire has been dreadful for United but he's always been good for England. The amount of clueless nonces jumping on the Maguire bandwagon is pathetic
Love💙 Chelsea...havertz,timo,mount,sterling
Good goals from my Chelsea players, Kai havartz treble and Maison mount
From this match we can assume that Maguire > VVD Yeah VVD had that aura defend but Maguire has more than that
Passive skill Maguire active
Mount 💪🏾
Hahaha i love your comments about Maguire. Greetings from Italy.
Maguire is so kind 😂
When Maguire plays the team Won 😂
Lord Maguire 😅
England must be call mings from aston vila for replace maguire
Maguaire is not football player wkwk
Maguire meme player
Maguire, was better at Leicester. A big fish in a small pond.
Maguire is such a pure talent. He can plays in both of them
chelsea fans watching this is a funny thought
Lord Mcguire is truly underated and underpaid by his standards. With almost an assist in every game , he should be paid more. Statistically speaking He is paid a weekly salary of $238,000, which equates to a yearly income of $12.4 million, by his standards, this is like minimal wage.
What a Game!!!
RIP England in World Cup if Maguire still play in
Maguire oh maguire, what are u doing?
Harry kane- when it's Germany it's show time
Why cant havertz do that for chelsea!!!
Harry Maguire should be crowned as the king of the UK not Charles
Bad penalty to give away from Maguire def. But to blame him for the 2nd in madness. lost possession in the their half, they had the ball for a while before a world class finish. I'll criticise when it's deserved but it goes too far sometimes.
Not Germany..Not England have a chance to win the World Cup
Can we all just take a second to marvel at the most underrated player, none other than our very own Harry Quagmire.
gemes ama maguire
One thing is sure. When the opposition sees Maguire's playing they must says to themselves :  Oh , I think  we must have a very good chance of winning this game !
Truly no words for how Maguire and Pope make it to this level.
Maguire memang terbaik utk penyerang tim lawan
maguire sampah
0:48 this is what the English call a good player.
Maguire the GOAT
Que guapa la camiseta de alemania no? ^^
This commentator needs to chill 😂😂
95% comments here confirm Maguire’s pure brilliance and talent. Keep it up man
تعالو قناتي تصميم هدف هافيرت
Pahlawack🥵
Maguire should get given a position change opportunity. He has scored decent goals from set plays. He failed time and again as defender too error prone. Put him in centre midfield, experiment, some players have excelled from a position change.
Chelsea player is the best 💪💪💪
Artist-nya tetep Maguire ... hehe ... kalo kata Netizens: Titipan Pemda 😁
Why they post the damn results ...............................
Chelsea players seems to only perform on national teams
In every of us exist little bit Maguire
Maguire is such a talent, he plays extremely consistently, even when he is on the bench or sitting at home looking after the kids he has the same affect on games
Maguire playing with 500ms
Why did VAR give Germany’s penalty. Surely that’s a pen at first glance
Life is unfair when Maguire can be a professional footballer
مع الأسف المنتخب الألماني لم يتأهل إلى النهائيات
Kane is an over rated penalty merchant
How de fk does Maguire still plays😭😭
PLEASE DON'T BLAME IT ON MAGUIRE, he just doing his job....!!! We all know Maguire position is CB right?, it stands for: Covert Backstabber
Maguire is stupid
This dudes voice ain't it
That white boy is A propar english embrassment 😄
Opponents cheer and  celebrate when they see Harry Maguire on the team sheet and in the starting 11 🤣 they all scream he with us on the field I'm sure
Maguire is the definition of EPL, Everybody's Premier League😂😂😂
Maguire is the first and only defender in the history of football to ever play as a Defender for Both Teams on the field 🤣
Sir. HARRY Maguire the goat 🤭
Maguire best striker in the world 👍👍 Best captain on MUFC
mancity game to be benched
I have nothing personal again Maguire but professional yes he need to go out it’s frustrating 🫠🫠
"Maguire is pure unfiltered talent.Everytime i see him play i simply stand in awe" - Stevie Wonder
Maguire binary opposite of Matthaus.
Хотел написать остроумный комментарий про Магвайера, а потом зашел в комментарии: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That ball for England's first was never over the line.
Harry Maquire, the dream opponent of every striker. The guy can be counted on.
Maguire Worldclass tackle to the ankle...
EWAKO 🇮🇩
Kai havertz is the GOAT
Maguire improves himself with every match from worst to worst ever..Rare gem..! 😂
Bisakah anda berbahasa inggris? Oh tentu bisa.. coba katakan sesuatu harry maguire😂😂
Maguire needs to retire at this point
Two teams that just dont have it, theyll probably have  a short visit to the World cup
I can't believe there isn't a replacement for maguire.  What is Southgate doing?  Is he the only one who can't see how awful maguire is?
Anjirr yg komen isi,a magueir semua wkwkw
Maguire will win the World Cup. But not for England!
Long Live Lord Maguire! 😆
Maguire 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Gak di club gak di timnas ngalawaaak aja kerjanya maguire ini
Mean while Maguire What I hv done
sengit walauapun masih ada
Damn I really wanted Saka to score that goal man

Pure attacking instinct from Maguire.
Key to success:  ditch Maquire
Disclaimer: dear manchester united fans all compliments for Maguire are pure sarcasm. No value addition. Thank you
Meguaiyer kaki krang itu cok
Man of the match definitely goes to the German lad...McGuire.
Harry Maguire might be the greatest defender of all time. I’m honestly not joking.
England won't get past the round of 16 at the world cup
Wow
Maguire berulah 😂
England have not won an International Cup since 1966 and they were lucky then. I can guarantee you that England will not win an international cup in your life time. Dont take my word just be a little patient and look back and see how right i was. Other nations have won the World Cup several times and even Greece won the Nations Cup for gods sake.
ฟายเล่นบอลฟรอมแบบนี้ยังติดทีมชาติ

God save maguire
The guy is exceptional talent. Count yourself lucky to have been born into his era.
Maguire man of the match
Chelsea training
The German Maguire
Maguire bangsd
S’il y a deux personnes qui doivent quitter cette sélection c’est Southgate et Maguire. Les deux constituent le tendon d’Achille de cette équipe nationale.
F maguire
Ter Stegen was phenomenal
All about Maguire "idiot"🤣🤣🤣
Men of culture in football = Lord Harry Maguire
Maguira doesn't like to disappoint his  enemies
Maguire such pure talent 😂😂😂😂he love goals and penalty from every where
Maguire KiNG Content 🤣
Thank you southgate for not playing tomori, keep maguire on your rooster. forza milan
England, you will win nothing with Shaw and Maguire.
Nick pope and Harry maguire cost England 3pts
what is maguire doing in this team.
Wow!  What a great performance from Maguire, best of the bestest, keep it up the good work
Ko bisa ya maguire masuk timnas ? Heran
That’s why Mug sitting on the beach in MU.
England trying to play from the back is funny....all backwards passes and a big kick by the goalkeeper .... Stick to what they know long ball and wish for the best
Timo Warner destroy the German National team
Maguire is the reason I watch football❤️
Normalement à 82 minutes il y a une  pénalité  avec une carton rouge pour le défenseur allemand
why he succeed in the international rooster lol. also,why everyone score and jumping to celebrate but stop halfway coz of its ronaldo style?
the second of Germany, ....german precision..!!
Get rid of magguire. He is in terrible form, not sure what is going on but he is playing miserably in this day and time.
Selalu menyajikan permainan terbaik terimakasih lord mujair atas lawakannya
Maguire is done, there is no way ten haag playing him again except united were 5-0 up 😂
Lord maguire
Maguire and Pope... whose judgment needs readjustment... was it their own or Southgate's
50fps video next time please🤔
Southgate choose Stup*d maguire than Tomori. 😂
Maguire facing form meltdown...its so bad...he need a rest..
Die Verteidigung ist sehr schlecht Stegen war großartig
My god, cannot stand that commentators voice
Germany are really unlucky to only get a draw when they had maguire by their side.
Maguire:" ...so we are not playing in white shirts?"
Asik seri ja german ni
every goals scored by premier league players 🔥🔥
ITs comin home aye? with maguire? lol XD
England:" Hey, we could really go for a win" Maguire: " Hold my beer...."
Maguire stupid is bodoh 👎😂
Maguire doesn't deserve England call up
What a surprise...MaGuire mistake costs a goal
Too much hype for Hansi can't even out think a mediocre coach like Southgate how he will win world cup. Germany going to fail miserably
Maguire.... 😂😂😂😂😂
You win or draw matches despite Harry Maguire, not thanks to him!!!
أداء مميز
Inggris salah nya di liganya terlalu bnyk pemain asing.jadi potensi pemain nya sendiri gk dimaksimalkan di klub. Jadinya ya bgini, liga maju tapi terjajah.
I don’t understand why maguire plays every game tomori is better player
Ter Stegen is back to his best
Maguire needs encouragement right about now. Everyone seems to be on his matter.
Maguire is a disgrace
In maguire with rush
Love how England thinks they are the best when they score. Sorry lads, you ended up on 4th :))
that finger tip save by ter stegen
I-er a-hate a-this a-commen a-tator
See how he tries to be a striker.  Tried to dribble everyone in German defence. Try to be Maradona or Messi with his slow feet.Helping the second goal for Germany.
Why Maguire? Where is Ramsdale, Ben White?
Maguire 😂
Maguire is a double agent. Wonderfull
Its-a great-a commen-taary there, Steven Toast!
I don’t like Southgate’s tactical scheme at all. England is best suited for a 4231 possession ball. To get the most of the many young talents they have.
Where's Manuel Neuer ?
Poor Maguire.  I can't really defend him except to say his penalty was effectively equalized by the German foul.  The real culprit is the blown save by the England keeper that let in that third goal.  Why didn't he collect it?  Easy save?  No, but that's what the pro's are for, eh?
Is a true wonder how maguire still manages to play professional football
maguire is the true definition of equity, fairness and inclusiveness
Maguire is every oponent darling....
pure talent,  well done Southgate on your central defender to play for england!!!!
Havertz goal is a masterclass 💖💖💖💖
I respect Ten Hag only for benching Maguire
Love all the Maguire appreciation comments. It seems the world is finally starting to realize the genius of this defensive mastermind.
Lord magure😁😁
Maguare always the best in defence 💖💖💖
Maguire off Tomori in and everything will be alright
Ter Stegen and Havertz <3
Havertz on form in Germany 💖💖💖💖
suru mampuz ae itu MAGUIRE
No one more entertaining than ronaldinho.. but see.. maguire always do that..
Soldiers are we. England Soldiers are only good for dipping into eggs.
KING KAI 🔥
Bro i left this game when it was 0-1 if only i knew
Pov: ur trying to find a comment not about maguire
Mit Joachim Löw als Trainer hätten wir verloren. Hansi Flick braucht Zeit. Nach all den Jahren mit Müll-Entscheidungen von Löw, ist es klar, dass da viel Reparatur Arbeit zu leisten ist.
Lord Maguire. He was at it again.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
*"Maguire"* -YouTube comments
Spectacular match 👍👍👍
Maguire is flourishing in the false 5 role
C'est incroyable, il me semble que sur plusieurs buts le gardien allemand touche la balle.
who needs King Charles when we have King Maguire🤣🤣🤣
Butter fingers, typical of a Pope.
Thisuh guy'suh voiceuh doesuh myuh headuh inuh
He even was helping him to stand
Maguire will never let his Opponent's fans down.
I will buy Germany jersey its 🔥🔥
no offense i'm not british but how you guys stand player like Maguire to be in your national team i mean the dude is a legend
Atrocious commentating.
Maguire is haunted 😂😂😂
It's a usual thing for Maguire😁
How did england get a pen for that, shocking.
Graet game with a shity commentator
Germany is so blessed to have a phenomenal talent like Maguire on their team.
Cameleon Maguire is able to blend in into the team he is playing against that no one notices it. List him as a russian troop and Ukraine will win in no time.
We need to support Maguire to find another job
Shaw says Maguire is an amazing player think he should look up amazing in the dictionary????? Just as well England get penalties give kane a chance to score too
Maguire is a cow
Hahaha commentators is rude talking about butter fingers
Mujaer lawak klub 😂😂😂😂
Maguire !😂😂😂🤣🧐
England will not win a trophy without Harry Maguire so will utd.
Germany be careful,you may not qualify from the group stage (again) in the world cup ⚠️⚠️
Ramsdale is better than pope 100%
MAGUIRE IS DEFINITELY FINISHED 💯
maguire brings laughter to the national team
Merci "German Football " C'est un Beau Match de Betty de Bretagne FRANCE////
Luke Shaw played incredibly well for someone who hasn't been starting at club level. Someone who actually took the benching as motivation unlike our dear old Maguire.
Maguire and Dier could easily have been replaced with Tomori and another great player but Southgate has his own plans
Maguire is not something we require!!!!
Havertz
Timo W x Kai H ❤
89:25          miss you son !
Why Maguire away be 11 line up? Other better he but any coach away chosen he ,What point he good at? Bruh
where was this england in past few months?
Chiellini said he feels it's unfair people expect Maguire be the best on the field because of his 80m transfer fee... No Giorgio, they don't expect him to be the worst.
hARrY mAgUiRe
While Maguire is part of this squad, England will always fail miserably.
Great second half .just glad I was there .
Because of Popes error. Maguire gets away with it again. All papers say Popes error. It is a farce.
Selama ada maguire musuh akan terus tertawa riang
Doesn't England has another CB instead of Maguire? I mean, even a chair would defend better
Maguire is world class. 😍👍🐿He can't stop anyone.
Fair draw between the two teams.
Despite being English born and bred, nothing makes me happier than hearing that the England team choked
How much longer do we have to put up with Sterling. A striker with 80 caps for the woeful return of 19 goals. Both Mount and Grealish are better options on the left side of the attack. Take a bow Maguire for gifting Germany 2 goals. Surely time to bring down the curtain on Donkey's international career. On a positive note, for Man of the Match look no further than the two 19 yeat olds. Bellingham or Musiala: take your pick.
Marc-André ter Stegen saves🔥
Harry Maguire - The Entertainment GOAT
Not bad going forward, utter shambles at the back.

Nick pope is like cal the Dragon
Maguire the GOAT: I had to do something because the match was boring, and I did. you should thank me for that💪💪🤣🤣
Lord Maguire beraksi
Maguire = 🤡
Uber allez 🔥
King havertz is very good in this game
England would have won if Maguire was benched
Now England fans are going to have to endure Harry playing like this and being undroppable. Us United fans have had to watch every other defender out perform him but watch him captain them and them never get a chance. Gareth is Ole in disguise. Tomori and co won't be used no matter what Maguire does. Media will protect him and blame EVERYONE else but Harry. Get ready to be gaslighted!
Maguire is the greatest ever player he makes Ronaldo and Messi look like kids
Harry maguire 😂😂😂
Maguire out tomori in.
England until I die.
maguire trying to dribble past players in the opposition half then falling over and giving away another goal is one of funniest things ive seen lol he is pure comedy genius
Maguire isn’t even playing but south gath picked him over ben whit 😂😂
Kai havertz with a class finish.
you people should stop making fun of maguire
Harry Maguire is pure class
日本がドイツに勝てるイメージが湧かない……
Can this commentator not speak normally?
Rubbish Maguire
Maguire needs teammates who speak English....
kiper jerman terstegen gw kira muler
Havertz is a really big game player
Maguire es un chiste 😂
Maguiere asli penyakit ini orang .sama sekali gak guna
Bit disappointed with Germany. The golden era may have passed..
Pope and Maquire are simply not good enough.
MOTM for Germany.... Harry "Slabhead" Maguire 🙄
Maguire: It was always in my dreams to play for Germany.
Maguaire oh maguaire sungguh terlalu
All goal from premier league players
Everyone’s talking ‘bout maguire while Havertz had a good performance, didn’t he
I use to think the scam of what I ordered vs what I got was only in online business until I met Maguire 😂 Man Utd needs to be compensated.
Good job Maguire🤣,
URGENT! Look up what NSL and G4S are doing to us! And to this country....
Maguire and that 🧈 fingers keeper will keep making those mistakes
That Germany shirt is gorgeous, much nicer than our England shirts.
I see Maguire in the starting 11 , i watch the game, cause i know it'll be funny
Germany only needs a CF with Klose or Lewandowski profile and they will become unstoppable
Perry kane and Ferry maguire.
Maguire The G.O.A.T 🙏
Why is no one talking about Luke Shaws performance??
Hahahaha, Lord McGuire again?  😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅  Pity him 😆
@0:38 the goat showing his passing and kicking skills
Harry maguire does not have replacement such a pure talent
Stupid maguire
True
Maguire .. clod of the century !
Mistakes done by Southgate:       Benched Aron Ramsdale and play N. Pope as # 1      Chose Maguire over at least Kyle Walker would perform better in the back three over lame Maguire.      Benched Bukayo Saka and play him as Wing back instead of typical winger role he used to play at    Arsenal.      Not call Kalvin Phillips in his squad .....
classic bro kai havertz
Maguire hilft dir dabei, das finale deutschland zu erreichen.
Nobody is talking about Kai classic goal.
I will say it again Southgate.  For as long as you misplace Saka in your squad, and play Harry in place of Ben White, and keep assuming Aaron Ramsdale, bro you will keep struggling.
Wow, I like the fact that England was able to score 3 goals! I expected somewhat like 1-3 in favor of Germany.
Germany has a bunch of stiffs at the back and no striker. Expect another quick exit at the World Cup.
Harry Kane penalty was another level
I would 100% take titus bramble over maguire
Point this Harry maguire
Maguire is a beast 🔥🔥🔥
Maguire thinking white is england
Goat maguire is back!
Frankly, I think we are missing a real center forward and we need to find that solidity in defense, it's alarming the last two games I've seen. Klose miss you
Bro I feel bad for Maguire now …. Let’s give this guy a break damn…oh wait he kicked the guy in the leg in the box … why!
I prefer Tet stegen over Neuer
Southgate's the best ever manager for Scotland 😌
ALL THAT IS LEFT NOW IS WINTER WORLD CUP.  🤩
Great game to watch for the neutrals
Southgate bad yes man manager. Horrible man
Maguire the GOAT
I hope Maguire is no reading this comment section, otherwise he’ll think that you all really love him… because if he tackles criticism and sarcasm like he plays…. Well…..
The fact that Maguire even gets considered for an England call up based on his performances, is extremely hard to understand! He is one of the all-time worst, if not the single worst Premiership defender I have ever seen!
sorry ter stegen. After conceding 4 goals in 2 matches his slim (very slim) chance of getting neuer's spot is gone
People say gullit, rijkaard or beckenbauer are the most complete players  But in reality, the most complete player is Harry maguire  He plays against 21 players every match. His defending is world class, and when he is not defending, he is creating chances for the players and he also that’s the goal scoring quality along with the elite winning mentality which ronaldo possesses
Where’s my TAA?
Harry Maguire 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Saka là yếu tố giúp tuyển anh có điểm
that mistake from Maguire for the pen is the kind of nonsense he's been pulling at United for years
What'sA theA matterA withA theA Commetator'sA Voice A?
idk the problem is not maguire is the coaches choosing him 😂😂😂
Maguire rightly slagged, but you don't see a mistake like that from Pope very often!  Really tough one after they fought back to go ahead.
Score 3 - 3, what a game 🔥😳
Gareth talk nice about Maguire after this game....So Im pretty sure that he will move him on the bench.
Maguire in on 🔥
Luke shaw goal reminds me of Lampard goal that was never a goal.
منتخب المانيا افشل منتخب وافشل اللاعبين عند المانيا فريق فد اسم كلشي مبيهم يرعب حالهم حال البايرن مدرب وادارة فاشلة لا هجوم ولا شي لا وسط لا احتياط لا دفاع  ااذا الهجوم فيرنر هايهية اخذنا كاس العالم  اني من محبين المانيا و بايرن ميونخ  بس هذ الواقع
Please EHT don't play Maguire against Man City on Sunday. He will be a Man City best player of all time just in one match.
MAGUIRE😅😅😅😅😅YOU GOOD
Shaw had a great game 🎮
Harry Magnificent 🐐
An improvement, some positive signs, but also some concerns.
Why do they play these idiotic michey mouse nations cups ? Just em and mm
That voice. My Lord. Like the guy’s hernia is giving him grief during the commentary.
at this point I feel pity for this man. his confidence is in shambles.
Maguire gonna cost England the wc
Yes thats maguire .....the best defender that every club n country wants to hsve
Musiala is generational talent
Maguire has d most number of assists in European football.... Also he is d best captain for club n country as he makes his teammates to play at d highest level by giving dem tasks during each n every game... I have really very high regards for such a player n would love to see such player in my opponents team...
The speed, the agility and tactical genius of Maguire did well for both teams, but better for the German team.
Havertz’ form disappears while playing for Chelsea, for the national team he plays as though he were his Fifa self
I came here for the Maguire show .
Everybody can have a bad day... a bad week... a bad year...
Well Maguire plays for germany
Maguire provides great assists to the opposing  team.
Man of The Match: Harry Maguire
The Country That Used to be England 3-3 The Country That Used to be Germany
Lord Maguire, the best defender in england football story
Is this @omegaluke doing the commentary
Shame Germany had 13 players against England's 9 and the three lions still got a draw.
Chelsea players on fire
Why Maguire on the first squad?
Maguire 🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪...... southgate 🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈
this could have been avoided if u would just let go the worst player ever
Maguire is nub
Maguire is joke
Why the highlights here are mirrored and different from others streams ? Although it's official 🤔
The man who brought Maquire into the game, is the biggest clown
i’m genuinely curious how managers still play Maguire after 50 terrible games & Karius had one bad game and is a bench player at a sorry team now
8min long highlights are more conclusive so if you want me subscribing, start getting those.
Maguire being maguire.
That 2nd Germany goal, pure skill!!
Man United let Bailey go and kept donkey Maguire
Schlotterbeck slightly evolving to Maguire Level. Unbelievable!
I can play like Maguire
Kyle Walkers face said it all when the ref pointed to the spot after the Maguire challenge. It was like, this fkin clown.
Maguire ohsem....
I'd rather see Connor coady play at cb instead of maguire
The commentator sounded like he was switching between past and present tense 😂
I want to read comments talking about the game but all I see is people joking about Maguire still because they have no imagination
Harry Maguire
IRAN, USA and Wales are delighted to have Maguire in their team
Eee lontong lah maguayer
Que dis oh, maguire là, il ne vous énerve pas?en club M U,il fou la merde, en sélection, c est la catastrophe.hunnn, son football là, il a appris où même 😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣
With players like pope and maguire is impossible that England get far in any competition
Maguire 😂😂😂
👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
Southgate wants to encourage maguire,  he wants to give him moral support though at the cost of loosing. He is out of the pecking order at man utd and the only hope he has remained with is at his national team. Even during the man utd vs Arsenal game,  he only came on the pitch for a few minutes and almost gave away a penalty. May be he could do a better job in the central Middlefield not defence.
"Maguire is the best false 4 in the world." Pep Guardiola
CEX
Harry Maguire 😅🤣🤣 Pope reaction so slow
Maguire is an inspiration, he boost morale for the opposing teams,,
Who's Maguire ?🤭
Hary Maguire..... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤡🤡🤡
Maguire is a sure odd
Harry Maguire once again proved he's world class defender 😂
Maguire truly is the best defender in the world.
The love we have for maguire
That last Ter Stegen's save is world - class
saka goblogggg
Maguire, the man, the myth, the legend.
Josua kimoci
The slabhead Maguire will be the golden ball winner in the World Cup, I tell you. He is such a complete talent, can score for both side of the team easily
Maguire is a genius! Imagine we have Maguire at the back and Rashford in the front!  What a great team? How scary ?
marguire ngu
Chelsea .
Germany were lucky to even get a draw
Maguire🤣🤣🤣
nice match🙃🙃😉
as a united fan H Maguire is a one of a kind talent
a very gifted maguire
What was so hard in playing those Arsenal boys? They are on form and are well coached. Saka, Rasmdale and Benwhite. England had way too many mistakes at the back.
How does the commentator contain his excitement
THE MOST OVERRATED PLAYER,Maguire
Maguire should just leave man utd already... He's not a man utd material, he was d one that singlehandedly destroyed man utd last season
why can't chelsea players perform like this while playing for chelsea
Maguire needs dropping from the England team. Could have been 3-1 but no, that clown gifted them 2 goals
Not many germans play for germans
매과이어 진짜 레전드네
Time to cancel Maguire and Saka. Goodbye. Never return.
Lord Maguire
Hari mắc hài😂
I do not understand what Southgate sees  in Sterling, Shaw and Tripier. In Qatar they will disapoint as usual unless he chooses. Pope. Defensors: (Walker/Arnold, Stone, Maguire & Eric Dyer/ Chilwell) Ward-Prowse, Bellingham, Henderson, Shelvy from Newcastle ,Madison & Declan Rice.  Strikers: Kane, Grealish, Foden, Vardy, Gordon from Everton, Tammy Abraham.
Sack Southgate before it's to late.
Every comment is about the defensive ROCK that is Sir Harold Maguire!!
Gareth Southgate not a perfect coach… The biggest example of that is maguire still in the team.. better to kick out..
Happy to see Maguire getting those touches. He's my bet for balloon d'Or
Germany drew - No Neuer England drew - Maguire first 11
매과이어 똥치우기 바쁘네
MU and Maguire whahahahah created for each other))
England.From Azerbaijan
Нацисти против нациста 🤣
Red card to that germany defender
Harry bless Maguire
Maguire my player of the last to seasons in the PL
Maguire is competing with Haaland for maximum involvement in goals 😂!
King Maguire
Any player can have bad season.  Any player can also make mistakes. But when someone repeat mistakes over and over, season after season, that's a problem. It's not like Maguire playing bad. This is his level.
I genuinely can't believe there's still people out there who think Pope is better than Pickford.
I really don't know why I always prefer England in this matches. Because I know what they made in the last summer. But I think they are experts in propaganda. Anyway, I hate to watch Ter Stegen suffering. In this match the perfect fight would be against Manuel Neuer.
Harry Maguire must have the most assists of any football player ever
These two giants never disappoint.
1:16 I dare him to shoot like that at chelsea
Saka change the game for England while Maguire played for his true country Germany
southgate dash Germany one point because of his technical error how on earth you are inviting Maguire a bench warmer at the expense of some regular starters you now see the result
That's how our Lord finished Maguire's great art
Mount goal is like that of Eden hazard against Spurs
As a Man utd fan, I can never be proud of Our captain🤦‍♂️
Dreadful commentator!
0:48 ofc
they are more like netherland vs parma
Thought Nick pope was a decent keeper but he's not a reliable for big game.
My Chelsea boys are making me proud
Looks like an easy fix.......... Don't put Maguire in an England shirt ever again. Southgate got what he deserved here because of his blind loyalty. Ben White is in much better form than Maguire, I mean my nan is in better form than Maguire as well! Also Nick Pope, sorry not international level. Went down in stages for the penalty and even then only move 1 foot from his starting position.  Still feel this team is only 2 or 3 players short of world beaters though. We have some great young players out there.
wstop blaming maguire.
Lord Maguire strikes again. Ballon d'Or performance !
Stop mocking him..😅
Poor commentary but y'all are worried about Maguire's performance alone 😂
Maguire such a great player his what England always needed making assists truky the greatest defender of all time
I'm struggling to decide if this commentator was commentating live or post game
Sending Tomori home and playing with Harry Maguire 🤣🤣🤣
Germans started creaming themselves when they saw Lord Manure.
Maguire is a genius
Harry Maguire has redefined the definition of late tackle. First half : get beaten  Second half : tackle
The commentator has such an annoying voice
Maguire deserve Baloon D'Or
Wow Maguire performance yesterday was just wonderfull , beautifully!
England might not make it out the group stage if maguire keeps playing at this world class level, scoring and assisting
Is Maguire a German team player?
Le gardien England est un putain de merde il est tellement nulle 😂
reli can't understand why King will be in the squad
England, what did you do at the of the match? You should win with these subhumans...
England will win the World Cup 2022 with both Maguire n Pope in defence.
Alemania
Must be favourites again for the World Cup , go Gareth !😂😊
Say anything about maguire he's still sh*t,will always be, does he even feel the need to retire knowing how hated and sh*tty he is.
Havertz better be bringing this form back to Chelsea for the match against Palace!
Macguire, such a difference maker, there is no contest, pure talent, when he's on the pitch the paradigme shifts, the whole world is jealous about Germany having him this game
Maguire lawak
Harry maguire like babys...
cant wait to seee maguire world cup
Great er commentary on a exciting er game of er football!
Miguire really2222
Although I never really liked Ter Stegen and wanted Trapp to start ahead of him in absence of Neuer , he was solid.  Two brilliant saves , especially the one against Saka , his ball distribution is amazing but guy still needs to improve.
how can you pick maguire over bem white
Harry Maguire!
It wasn't just Maguire who messed up,Mr Pope was not all there also!
Maguire will go down as a legend in football,  he invented "kindness "new art of defending
most annoying commentator ever omg....
In Maguire we trust , the new slogan for every opposition team , the guy is legendary  , he's naturally gifted.
Maguire is a problem wkwk
Maguire Comedy again 😅
Maguire 🤡
นิค โป้ป  ยังไม่ดีพอสำหรับทีมชาติ พิคฟอร์ด ดูดีกว่า
Havertz miss sitters for Chelsea. Here he is scoring from outside the box

Can maguiere play smart? Always blunder 😢
Probably the best kits England and Germany have ever had
Maguire,  so good he doesn't need to play fir his club to get picked fir his national team. Absolutely world class for the other team. Pope on the other hand, has made one mistake and we won't see him again
This ‘commentator’ must have the most affected voice I’ve ever heard. Putting an A sound at the beginning of almost every word like it emphasises the drama somehow. He just sounds utterly demented!
Chelsea players scoring goals
Maguire please can you quit football please please,i am better than you really,if you play you always destroy your team, do another sport like golf,or singing,youtuber etc🫡🫡🫡 QUIT football
Beware of the Germans!!!! 2022 world cup is coming
great match
maguire 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The fact that it took him the help of VAR to determine if it was a penalty or not is shameful. Even a man blind with one eye could have seen that.  The terms of licensing to become a referee needs to be made more stern.
Maguire🤣🤣🤣
The crouts are as bad as England atm
as an argentina fan seeing the "big national teams" struggle like this gives me hope that we will win the world cup
England has 2 Harrys in history. Kane and Maguire
Nick Pope is in goal because.........
Nick Pope, this isn't a goalkeeper, it's a clown. Sucks, this British team.
Harry maguire is the best :))
The German Football logo is Nero's cross, a symbol of the fight against Christianity.
Kane....it's only a pen kid
맥과이어 ㅋㅋㅋ. 참 재밌는 아이.
Maguire 😂😂😂😂
Hahaha bukan cuma di klub, selesai juga karir Maguire di timnas Inggris 😅
Maguire is very talented
That Germany jersey 🔥
Sterling sucks, why are you still playing? Stop playing, the team is better as you can see. when turning it off Unlikely to be in the national team
Maguire like guai in italian, Guai = problemi
Havertz, Mount 💙
Lol Harry Kane celebrating as though England isn't getting relegated
Pope the goal keeper cannot to kick or save why is he in the team ?
Maguire is a professional own goal machine
Немцы как всегда обосрались ведя в счете 0-2
I hadn’t known that Maguire is an Internet hero.
Maguire masih di pakai??🤣
Player of the match; Harry Maguire!
Me watching myself in the football
You'll never win if maguire plays
madrid should place a bid for havartvz, I love this guy,fede and him together will be unstoppable 🔥
Maguire 😂😂😂😂😂
King Harry  maguire 1
Maguire is such a talent football didn't come across until him 😉😉😉
German players have thanked Maguire for the assist
0:43 Pure Class defending from Harry
How is Maguire still in a starting 11? Can England fans answer me that question?
1 maguire comment...funny... 2 maguire comments...reasonably funny ... 4896 maguire comments... no originality
Maguire a reliability
Maguire needed faster defenders next to him to recover his miss passes/assists. It's not his fault.
Just put Manuel Neuer
한국인찾아여
maguire ngelawak lg
Pope and maguire, get them as far away from the England team ASAP.
Maguire is Maguire
Southgate out the door hopefully
Harry Maguire is every goalkeeper's nightmare
You can keep your man of the match, McGuire!
Maguire... please, England are in the red today, did no one tell you.
Wished Havertz and Mount played like this for Chelsea.
Harry Maguire is so underated he provided 2 assists
How Germany weren't awarded 2 penalties il never know
Hahahahaha no 5 ooooh nooooo oh nooo no no no
Maguire is the worst cb in history it's embarrassing
Germany terribly needs a striker. Just look what Flick's system can do with a top striker up top (Bayern and Lewa). Rudiger and Sule look like the starting CB pair. And please bin Kehrer he's average af
Germany is getting more and more African every time... seriously, stop replacing us!!
Maguire the real clown
:D
Commentator sounds awful
No rues no party
😁🥳🎉🎊 Harry McGuire, cheeeeerrrs!🥳🎉🎊
MATS is a beast
🤔Havertz and Sterling, are they in the same team? 😯C' mon, what is wrong with Chelsea?!
Incredible is hardly an appropriate word for this lot !
Harry Maguire is nothing but an absolute legend. 💯
Pope and Maguire were class for Germany.
Maguire and Saka are the future of Southgate
😁 Harry McGuire 🥳🎉🎊
And this guy actually complains or...blames all around him for not playing for Man Utd. Disgrace
매과이어 도대체 왜 선발이지? 잉글랜드 잘하는 센터백이 많을텐데
Thanks maguire....😜🤣🤘
Maguire must be related to the manager or one of the F A,there's no way you pick a bench warmer speaker for England,a love child or nephew,even son?
Maguire should go do farming
Man of the Match Harry Mauguire for Germany
The commentators voice is ridiculous
McGuire 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 English keepers🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Another word class performance from the god of football Harry Maguire. I am waiting to see more from him.
England were lucky,  the 3rd goal was Pferdescheiße
hahahaharry maguire
Harry Maguire Man of the Match ...if England wants to win every match...need to change stop playing Harry Maguire.... ..
I switched off when kai scored his first and I thought I was dreaming when I saw 3-3
Maguire has taken the mantel from Phil Jones.
That kai goal was impeccable
maguire😅
Has he been sacked yet
Whis this commentator ? Bloody annoying
"A goal is a goal,doesn't matter on which side you score" - Lord Maguire
Why only his managers do not see Maguire is not a football player ?
Maguire - defending reimagined.
Nah just replace Gareth Southgate with Sarina Wiegman at this point. Maguire is the gift that keeps on giving.
Maguire !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I hate it when they include the score in the title. No surprises
영국엔 매과이어 말고 다른 센터백은 없슈?? 왜그러는겨?????
Good 😂👍 Maguire
Have not seen such a dry surface in top flight football....looked like velcro.
“You’ll never learn by mistakes if you continue to deny them”.
Tomori > Maguire
England Germany cousins
Harry MacLooser.
pertandingan yang seru england vs germany... semangat terus
Maguire must be a very kind and caring person, because he play like sh but still keep his starting spot, whether its Ole or Southgate. Thankfully ETH is more a merit based person
Maguire out..
It's clear that Shaw still has and deserves a place at United team right now. But that other English defender ..., I don't know, man. He's on the team and the skipper just because he's English.
ggwp mvp maguire
Maguire is so flat footied and unmobile its just ridiculous,  Southgate just bloody wake up mate
German Anglo African Turkic football
Love it ..  yes maguire did make 2 mistakes that lead to goal yesterday but was he the only player on that pitch who failed to deliver or do we just pick on him as it’s easier ?..  Foden was again poor in an England shirt Sterling still missing sitters and not performing to a high standard  Kane zero effect in the game apart from penalty ..  James had a average game and keeper was terrible but we found our scapegoat so let’s pick on one man rather than blame the team ..
I’m confused why pope is in goal 🤷‍♂️ we’ve got ramsdale on the bench
Sack southgate... Show him gate
Ronaldinho: "Best defender of all time? Harry Maguire. He always gives teams a chance to score."
Maguire made germany scores 😂
It’s not fair that Germany had 12 players and England only 10  ! Maguire accidentally put a red shirt on !  England just can’t defend and Maguire and Walker should not be in the team.
Jesus this commentary is garbage
People need to understand that Maguire is what we call in this modern era, a support defender. His role is to intentionally make mistakes to trigger and stimulate the brain’s fighting spirit for his teammates to play better as perfectly shown in this game. Now, anyone can do that yes, but Maguire has mastered the art by showing how natural it looks. Get off his back!
Maguire the goat
Comandante Maguire.
Miguaer stupid
It was Chelsea men show
Beautiful pass harry maguire
A One A nothing A lead A germany A take the A lead… is this guy serious, is this guy being paid to commentate like this?
Maguire has to be the Greatest defender in the history he can't stop helping opposition to score goals
I love you maguire... 😂😂😂
Maguire STUPID Player
full
Has Harry boy ever been good? I guess he must know some dark secret about southgate which garanties (spelling?) him play time...
reall madirad🙊
German people are very lucky to have a player of such caliber. (Maguire)
MAGUIRE
Maguire is show😂
Maguire😂😂
Whats up with URRR the Commentary, with all the URRRRs being used before UUURRRR the start of each UUURRR sentences....UURRRRR!
Maguire MOM again😂
The German attack is too much class, no defence can handle Maguire.
Maguire Destroy Manchester United, now his job is to destroy England in WC 2022. Good Luck England!
Maguire the best german on the field
England and Germany?...they will  not win  the world  cup
Maguire to team INDIA
80 million pounds defender ! First class price, 3nd class quality! Together with 3nd class manager, nothing we can say !
Has anyone ever taken a dog for a walk and picked up Maguire in a plastic bag?
Maguire 👍👍
Please someone tell southgate that he is the dumbest coach who did not start tomori and chillwill instead of Maguire goat of defending and overweight luke shaw
That's some world class commentary by Zap Brannigan.
맥과이어 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
If England's continue team selection like this...world cup group..that's it
chelsea vs chelsea
What happen with lord Mujaer 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Maguaire is such foolman
WELL ALL I CANT TELL YA IS ITS NOT COMING HOME HAHHAHAHA ENGLAND SUCKS
Maguire makes striking more easier
Maguire is a stupid player. he is not a professional He plays like a 10-year-old who plays football during school lunch breaks Southgate should have cut him out of the England squad. Bored with stupid people like maguire 🤯
Looks like another Premier League All-Stars friendly match.
General question for all commenters here: say what you like about Harry Maguire (and you have), the guy has been an excellent defender in his time. Now, I'm old enough to remember the great Des Walker shorn of form and confidence (when he was at Sampdoria I think), so what do you think Maguire needs? A change of club? A loan out? I know, you could say things like 'repatriation' or 'to take up a different sport' but if you've got a minute, what do you reckon would be the best fix for the guy? Over to you all...
Man I can't wait for November 20th😪⚽️👌🏽
Bukayo Saka Best England Player for the Future
Ter stegen ✨
credit where credit is due with Harry Maguire...........that is a pretty good impersonation of Titus Bramble that he's been doing for a couple of seasons now.
MAGUIRE THE BEST DEFENDER
👍 👍
Such weird commentary
Kudos to Southgate and England team management for selecting Maguire to play.
Baily was right. Maguire is being favored Tomori is better than this guy yet he's black
Harry MaGuire is so poor, if he didn’t cost 80 million he’d be somewhere in the championship and nowhere near the England side
Sancho would've score the last attack
Poor Maguire... 😐
We can score we can draw we can lose but we can't win
Great game with two heavyweights exchanging punches.
Is Ramsdale injured?? Some of the selections are questionable
Y'all are just mean under this comment section 😂😂😂
Harry maguire and this commentator. The 2 most annoying things of the week
Pope is dog
This nick pope is just a useless goalkeeper. I prefer Pickford over him
Watching Maguire defend is a giving hopes to millions of people who can't play football neither.
Who is this voice over? Sounds like when you do an impression of a 1980s wedding DJ! Had to watch with the sound off.
Harry Maguire 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ahhh Maguire, the new Phil Jones. Even Jones was better at defending
Seeing Harry Maguire play it gives m motivation to play in England squad right now in world Cup 🍶🍵
Only stupid coach using mcguire
OMG...I watched the match from the opposite side camera angle
What was southgate thinking starting maguire
What a crazy game. 6 goals after the break. Maguire doing what Maguire does best. At this point I think southgate should call the likes of tomori and Ben White.
How this guy is a part of such an incredibly talented team, I just don't get it.
I would never step into Maguire's shoes. I would rether  die  What a shameful career🤦‍♂️
That commentary was annoying
German Fans Really Enjoyed British Comedy Football Action 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 👍🏼😁
At least we did not lose
I cant understand why people are suggesting that Benzema deserves the balon d or. Its clearly going to Maguire
1:32  Ter Stegen is a good goalkeeper but i have to say, this should have been easily saved, ter stegen should have done a lot better here
Maguire ampazz
Ter stegen is the worst keeper bro Overrated asf!
Gareth is just psycho at this point droppin rashford and sancho and still has Maguire
Rivalry on the field . Germany always on top 😉
Amazing McGuire!!!
I'm here for the Maguire comments 😅
The english got lucky calls from the zebras

At last ter steagen having a decent performance for his country. He loves to represent Germany, i hope he continues to shine
I don't think Nick Pope is a good choice. Looking how he reaction in 1st penalty :(

For both teams, they should park and bus and wait for counter when they face Brazil, France, etc. England goal keeper is so weak....
Not Maguire's fault for Germany's goals, guys. He was simply not played in his best position (read: bench).
What a match!!! Germany and England played well. Germany had good game compared against Hungary which was horrible play by Germany. England also improved lot compared against Italy. Germany have wasted some presented opportunities otherwise won the game. Sane I don't know why he is playing for national team with dull face - no laugh, no angry plainly he contributes nothing at all. Musiala on contradict playing absolutely well and busy in offence and defense. Flick should include another youngster Yusuf Moukaku to more attacking varieties. Gnabry is struggling. Gundagaon had very good game. Havertz and Germans should play more aggressively like Kimmich. Saka and Mount from bench changed game dramatically in favor of England. Bellingham is absolute revelation for English. Kane should be booked for elbow but always gets away.
99,9% Anything about Maguire Me: great match
Magyire out lah

Football is going home................Heavely overrated English players, who in his right mind, pays over 80 million for Maquire ? Yes, Football is definitely GOING home.
Harry Maguire should become the GK for England!!!
Maguire my captain.. Proud GGMU
Thats why you play White and ramsdale ahead of maguire and pope
At this point King Charles should already be thinking of knighting Lord Maguire to Honorable Sir Harry Maguire 🙏🏿 🙌🏿 as his first order of business as King 🤴. What a player 👏 👌🏿
À revoir c plus que flagrant
To United and three lions fans : I think ur team gonna lose even without Maguire
Les Allemands ont laissé les anglais égaliser pour sauver l'honneur de l'imbécile sélectionneur et pour la Reine
Maguire 90 mill but cant do the basics of the game. Shocking.
He shd be terminated from man u
Maguire at its best
Lord maguire with an assist. Pure talent. No cap.

That's not a penalty for Kane....charity fc

I am not a big soccer fan but everyone praise Harry. what a good player he is.
Lo de Maguire sobrepasa la pena ajena, lo más triste de todo es que estará en el Mundial.

Maguire has proven his consistency  to support at least one goal in every match that he played
Southgate is fake news..  Lost 3 games at the world Cup ffs
Maguire this guy is big disaster
I like it I like it I like it!!!!
lol maguire football clown
what a team this match i saw like its playing world cup noiiice
Maquire better retire
Maguire is one of the worst players of this century!! How on earth he reached that level of professional football and why Manchester United paid 80mil for him is beyond anyones understanding. Leicester pulled off one of the biggest scams in the history of world football.
Wtf Maguire doing there??
Wkwkkwkwk maguire always. Good job.
Football is a game of entertainment and maguire doing it at its best 😲

Questionable goalkeeping from Pope
Southgate is the craziest coach I ever saw, Ben White and Aaron Ramsdale are doing well with Arsenal but he keeps playing with Maguire and Pope who are making him lose games stupidly hhhhhhhhhh
In fact, if three lion want to win, what you have to do is simple, don't play Maguire. And for the choice of the coach who did not choose the wrong player is Graham Potter.
1:09 I think Chelsea's fans will miss Timo Werner =((
Te differencies are obvios between goalkeepers.....
Lol. Maguire. You bum.
Maguire is the most complete defender of our time. What a player? Absolutely Legendary.

Watching them first 2 goals of Germany makes me think that England are getting paid to let them win. Nobody is even trying to put a challenge in 😂

Maguire could have worked hard in his studies and became at least a secretary of somebody, football is not his talent😞😞😞. I don't know how I'll tell my children that he was a captain of THE GREAT MAN UNITED  with Cristiano Ronaldo in it😒😒😒
Chelsea boys doin the job 💙
Germany shirt is beautiful
I watched gk video for England where the gk coach spent so long telling dem where parry the shots. Pope did it zero times and he is the number 1 madddd😑

Im here to find coment without the name of GOAT.
Maguire once again giving to the opposition. He's so kind hearted.
Agree or not but terstegen made 3 decent saves,he was a type of hero for germany
What do you think southgate
Bench is the best position for maguire
Glad to see that england’s still the same team. Leads and then bottles it at the very end 😂 🇭🇷♥️🇩🇪
Germany has not use their chance as Maguire in the pitch, they should win the game
The Great Lord "Maguire"..
Maguire never fail to make us happy with his legendary performance
What a player maguire is, always helps strikers to score. The consistency is unreal. Soon he will pass KDB in assists. What a lad just pure talent . Each and every nation wants this lad to play in World Cup 😂
C'mon you bluessss
The narrator has a horrible way of speaking. Why is there an 'ah' after every word? Raheem-ah Sterling-ah. WTF. Stop talking!

I miss these old-school summaries 😀✨
Maguire 🤣🤣🤣
No good  game
Germany ❤️
Maguire again😂
One thing is certain: Maguire getting In problems every game
Ter Stegen!!!
Remember when people said maguire always done well for England. Now you can see why he shouldn't be near the bench. Why isn't ramsdale starting while playing for the team in first place! Saka playing on the wing gets 2 assists imagine that.
I Hope Ten Hag see Maguire...🤣🤣🤣,and don't play Him at Man United...
It seems that the name Harry is a lot in the news for all the wrong reasons 🇬🇧
Thanks to Maguire they came 4th in the group! UCL next?
Bad decision for last penalty
Maguire wkwk maguire
How is Maguire everywhere i dont understand
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🤡🤡🤡🤡💪🏼🙌🏼
maguire is the best defender in the world, so almost all players don't want to be teammates
Southgate lets Maguire to play for the 3Lions??? 🤣🤣🤣
and the final score is :  England 3 : Maguire 3
Why I always see Kane scoring only penalities and sterling missing easy chances while on International duties? Is it some kinda type of trend or custom practiced in England.
Stupid Maguire :v
Maguire such a legend defender He loves football more than anyone else And lot help peoples  to scores Lol
Kai's 2nd goal is super class😨😨😨

Nick pope over hyped
Yeh ter stegen should never play for Germany again till neuer is alive
Imagine Maguire didn't play, England will win 3 - 1
This German defence is a disgrace 👎
is England for the world or for English, I can see Germany play for good performance, maybe England understand how to share glory this time
I kind of expected OG by McGuire;  Surprised he didn't score one, but contributed to the German's penalty... For years I've been wondering why Pope is not #1 goalkeeper.   Now, I know....
Me seeing all the comments being about Maguire while England also got a penalty 😏
harvetz mr clutch
I wish Maguire would play another 40 years, so that not only my children but also my grand children can have as much fun watching football as I have. You're a wizard, Harry. Thank you so much.
Harry Maguire is really troublesome. Due to him, the first goal was allowed.
Germany’s players checking if Maguire playing…  “Yes!! We got extra player!!” 😂
Why is Maguire in but Trent out.. from an American.. fk outta here.. and those england kits 🔥🔥🔥
Everybody is making fun of Maguire, but why is he on the pitch??. I don't get it. Is he still the captain also??. Surely cant be.

Maguire is a genius indeed. How he gets into the England squad would make even the legendary Houdini a mere understudy in the craft  of  fluking.
I am Haitian. In my country Maguire is a most stupid defender in the world.  The number 1
Harry maguire lol everywhere he goes the opponent always benefits from him 😂
All maguire can do, is only holding opponent's back, he thinks he is a security of an office 2:32
Other defenders you count tackles.. with Maguire it's all about assists.. and when it comes to assists hes right thr alongside Messi Nymar
Maguire is the defender that every game starts 12 vs 10.
I really do pity maguire.the internet has destroyed him
Watching maguire playing even now makes me belive there is black magic and this guys knows it 🤣🤣🤣....
maguire bek terburuk m.u.
Harry MaguERROR 🤣🤣🤣
Pope is the greatest goal keeper ever
Really surprised to see Saka playing so well at RW instead of LWB.
What a come back
Bench Bellingham now and play Harry Maguire ffs.  Qatar is coming up we need to be strong in defence innit
Kaloq kiper nya neur beda cerita😁
Here for Havertz and Mount
Why is Maguire in that team lol, he is not even a starter for united 😂😂 moreover a captain 🤣🤣🌚
Why Maguire still in England team ?😆😆 Southgate manager should resign 😂😂
It's been never easy to play 10 against 12, especially against Germany.
Anh tuổi gì?
If you are here to blame or troll Maguire, you don't know where the problem lies.
🤣🤣
Maguire is ridiculously good. When he's not defending, he's scoring or giving assists... Greatest of all time
congrats for maguire (MOTM)
Its coming home its coming home, it coming home in your dreams ! !!!
2:55  Flick: Thanks for playing Maguire Southgate: Welcome my bro I pick my best team

Oh oh oh my LORD my Best LORD LORD Harry Maguire so u best deffender Funny stupid 😂
Maguire 🗿🗿
Maguire is that little snot nose kid you have last pick of at school that nobody wants but the teachers insist you pick him. How can he still be in any side? Insane!!!!
Please, kick Maguire from football
Harry maguire what a classic defender for Germany.
Ter Stegen🔥
What an assist! Long live Lord Maguire!
Harry maguire is a comic relief
Well done harry...great job son
I’m a United fan and I hate McGuire so bad I feel bad for him .
Durby.
You all laugh now but when he scores a header in the WC final against Argentina……
Di timnas harry maguire jg ngelawak. Dia emang bertalenta jd pengganti mr. Bean.
People thinks it's a draw ...but it's Maguire who won... Damn all these comments regarding his talent against both England and Germany was amazing
I think Maguire has some personal information of Gareth Southgate, that's why he get chosen. And Harry Pane , another penalty scorer.
Maguire MOTM
Timnas Inggris beruntung punya Harry Maguire, tanpa dia mungkin Inggris akan kalah telak dr Timnas Jerman
Both Harry are just waste of space.
World most expensive defender Harry from Man United... I just hope ETH watched the match cause I really don't need this kind of display come this weekend
Saka playune indik kalah adoh karo raspot
Maguire totally fumbled (as usual) but so did England's goalkeeper, I think he should have done better especially with the third goal
Don't know why Harry Maguire is a 🐐. He want to score and assist to
Harry Maguire looks like he belongs in Nickelback.
Maguire is back
Man of the match : Harry Maguire
Maguire is the key that Southgate uses to unlock the drivel of the bias English media towards the England team. 6 games without a win and still able to ride high on hype. How easy the delusional are deluded!
Maguire deserves an OBE medal for his contributions to modern football, King Charles III please arrange that
Why can't Havertz do it for Chelsea????
What a match❤
0:45 maguire wkwkwk
Lord sir maguire. .......man of the people, by the people and for the people........ his passes are top notch
Maguire oh... Maguire... Pergilag ke pantai atau ke gunung... Bersantailah sejenak..
he is smiling
England and Germany where they belong on the table.  Thats what you get when only 4/11 of your players are actually class.
Football can breath without CR7 & Messi but it can't without Maguire. The true essence of Football is Maguire. So glad that I'm able to see this modern day classical defending.
Maguire=Ballon D'or
This is why football is predictably unpredictable.
Mmmmh these two teams I'm worrying about them in qatar , because when I see netherlands, belgium, denmark,suizland, croatia,japan, argentina, portugal these teams are ready for tournament but germany , england,Spain and france they're not ready for tournament
So proud of Harry
แม๊กไวท์ DoG
My biggest disappointment is, as always, the swathe of England 'supporters' who do not know what the word support mean. SUPPORT THE LADS, even Maguire, or watch someone else. Your cynicism will only hurt our team.
y'all British are ruthless. Harry Maguire is a national treasure.
Mcguire is the same equivalent to Latifi in F1.
Germany’s 🇩🇪 kit is best although the dominance of black makes it look as if it is inspired by SS uniform😎
Klo piala Dunia bsok maguire masih dipasang..jgn harap Inggris juara ..bek ngelawak muluk
Bye pope bye mcguire
Was expecting you to humiliate them given englands terrible form but instead you made them look like a world class team. Dissapointing.... 😒
Father of false number 4 harry Mcguire strikes again!
Being a Germany fan i felt an immense pain in watching Germany play in the first half.
Maguire is the only defender that can’t defend 1 on 1
Harry McGuire is a joke
Darwin Nunez would be happy to play against Maguire
Harry maguire is the best! He is the best striker partner
Maguire clown 😂
Everyone here talks about Maguire, and rightly so, what a clown. But what about this referee delivering an absolute shitshow, yet again...
maguire 😂😂😂😂
Miguare idiot player
All comments about maguire... jeezzzz
Great performance by maguire, ben white can forget about goin to qatar
Lord maguire doing what he do best again today 😂😂
kai what a beast.
Maguire+Shaw combination 🔥
out maguire in  National England football
Miguere rusak permaiman
England vs Germany is like Liverpool vs Man City. PURE EXCITEMENT
Maguire is always brilliant. We are privileged to witness such a talent in our generation 🙌
perry kane
I can't understand the insistence on Harry Kane.  His level of performance has been declining for a while and young talent must be given a chance, which is currently abundant in England
Saka outstanding performance!!
Southgate such an average manager. Didnt deserved to manage and lead england. He cant lead england to glory at all. Southgate should be sack! He is such a useless and clueless manager! Maybe a restaurant manager suits him well 🤣
Harry Maguire is the G.O.A.T 🐐 Pure Class..
Maguire And Shaw can't play fotbal......total idiots
With Maguire present , the Germans are playing with 12 players against 10
Germány kits like in 1939....
Mount , havertz scoring beautifull goals : mild celebration , its ok 👍 Lord kane winning a penalty : 🥳😎😱🎉🎊💥💪💪 goes wild
Maguire 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You're a wizard Harry.
1:17  The Chelsea Man 🔵
Fun fact:   The last official match Maguire started and won was against Norwich in April.
Maguire stupid
Что за вратарь у сборной Англии? Видно что очень переживает и нервничает, очень неуверенно стоял а ведь могли выиграть игру если бы не его ошибка в третьем голе
Why Harry still playing football?
Harry gives me hope. I am a non-player.
The commentator sounds more like his watching a fight!
I nt gna lie, i think speed wld get past harry maguire
I told you guys that Aaron Ramsdale is England's number one, you doubted it. Nick Pope put in a very poor display. Yea, he's a good shot stopper, but you've conceded a lot of goals and you're not doing that in a top team. Ramsdale on the other part is doing it well with a top team like Arsenal. Conceded less goals with has most clean sheet. Yet, you and Southgate neglected it. One more wrong decision and it will be a disastrous World Cup for England.
แบ่งกันคนละแต้ม
HARRY MAGUIRE IS THE BEST DEFENDER OF ALL TIME
0:39 what was maguire thinking,  he should pass early before opponent close space but instead he pass when opponent close space , i prefer john stone and coady better than maguire
Harry maguire 🤣🤣
Maguire contents😂
He blames De Gea for his poor display at United..he deserved at the bench!
Heri Mujaer kang lawak, mangkenye DeGea males passing ke lu
And Southgate still believe in Maguire🤦🤦🤦
Harry maguire 🤭
I can't wait for the 2022 world cup to roll. Waiting for lord maguere's comedic actions football. How stupid is it that Gareth Southgate chose lord maguere as a substitute for MU over Fikayo Tomory, a core player in milan who won the 16x clean sheet defense for Scudeto milan
Ohh praise the lord, such a joy to watch Maguire.
maguire is the real legend
Germanistan has no identity.
we, living in this era is blessed that we can see the most talented player of the century! keep up harry! you are a true inspiration
Lucky Germany got Maguire in the team.
I’m thinking Maguire out  and Fikayo Timori/ Ben White in. Still think Stirling is done, missed  a couple of chances again.
Maguire is everyone's weak fence. Leave the lad alone🙄. 99% of the people hating on him haven't even played football at a professional level😒
german have two best golkepper in world🥺
Does this acommentator arealise how many atimes he says a?
And yet he STILL gets picked 🤔how can this be? Do they not watch him "play" astonishing beyond compression 🤣🤣
England deserved to win
Nice play.... congratulation Germany and England....
Its just like Messi and ronaldo, maguire can also change the fate of the game in a instant.
I'm Argentine and there's something I don't understand, making jokes about Maguire. Why is it so hard to get the guy out of ownership? Is he a relative of the queen?
Not a penalty
Are there any black markets available in October. Man U cant wait for January's Transfer market to open
I hope Nick Pope doesn't get too much criticism for Germany's second goal.
Maguire💩💩😂😂
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 해리 마구이레 또 시작이네ㅋㅋ
Harrrrrrry Maguire!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Germany is on the same level as slovenia now days not one class player in this team
Keep performing my Keeper !!😻🐐
Немцы молодцом
If Germany fails to win a game against Maguire, there is no hope for any title.
At 80 million pounds what a bargain maguire was 🤣🤣
매과이어 댓글지분 ㅈ되네ㅋㅋㅋ
I think Chelsea should've started their own nation if yhey want to success. And as usual both Harry's did made wonders in the game, 1 for the team, and another one for the opponent.
Sterling conversion rate is💩
Kane sút pen kinh thật
England defense is poor
maguire GOAT, no doubt
Ở Việt Nam Ha ri đóng hài rất nổi tiếng🤣🤣
Ter Stegen 🪄
Germany got lucky... england played better
commentator doesn’t know that Havertz is left footed lol
Do your homework Hansi...A very weak defense...
Lord harry. 🤣
hari maguire 🤣🤣
Now all England fans know how us United fans feel
England can never win both media and the game. There is always one to forget in real life, and many english players are not who they really seem to be.
4 dari 6 gol yang cetak pemain CHELSEA 😎
This Germany is Only for Kickback .... Another Germany Teams in the past were Strong, Powerful and Fearsome
What a quality defeding from macquire
*99.9% the comments are about magiire, you don't even need to go there*
Hary maquire is a floop player i dnk why he played football
sane hit that curler and spun the ball so fast pope couldn't grasp it. smart smart move by sane and quick reaction by havertz. england unlucky.
Maguire selalu beri kita nontonan yang menarik setiap penampilan 😂
Harry Maguire😂
always Maguire
Hat's   of two  Our brothers  Germany    was lovely   two  watch   given   Boris Johnston  team  a helping  hand   he,s used  two  playing   with  sh,?t   #
Lol i hope football will never come home
Bradley Lowery
Sterling creates chances but conversion to Goal is very poor
Match between 2 loosers.  Like 3rd place match     Another  bad news for Germany.  If hansi take them to semi final I will say he is really good coach. I wonder they will pass group stage. Or maximum loose in quarter final  totally upset very few wins.  How can you satisfy with results like lost at home ground and draw draw and draw  While world cup 2 months away.
England's 3rd was never a penalty. But hey, a result is a result. Still not going to win the WC...FACTS!!!
Where has this Kai been?
Chelsea players play like they are not Chelsea players
MAGUIRE🤡🤣🤣🤣
My word southgate is clueless picking favorite over form.
Ter Stegen 🔥🤜🤛
Southgate said "there is a big agenda against Maguire", "I will lose my reputation over the decision to keep Maguire". It's black and white but still the coach is adamant, there is a campaign against his favourite. What a joke. There was no pressure on him, he could have turned and pass it back to the keeper, he could have passed it fast to his college but it seems he was absent minded. In his head he had already passed the ball and the feet was working on its own without the brain. It's a shame. And failing to murshle that lad Musiala, maybe preventing him from shooting but instead the lad confuses him and he concedes a penalty. Wow! Coach well done.
That Maguire when the coaches start benching him ehn. Ball boys will have appearance more than he would ever imagined
All goals in 2 half, guys it's world class comeback
It’s like everybody turn into a internet 🐀  Stop with Maguire my god!!!
Maguire...hahahahaa
Don’t let us forget nick pope spills
England is not a fighter mentality, neither military nor football
O’ dear Harry Maguire you sure deserve a Balon Dor for assists
The lord off all lords harry maguire..
Chelsea player shine
The fact that Germany failed to win against England with Maguire as starter is considered a failure to German football
Timnas inggris hrsnya sdh ga maenkan Maguire lg
Maguire?
Midfield south gate
Why is maguire still here? What else does he need t prove?
So glad Maguire is at Man Utd and starting games all the time.
Harry maguire best player in the world 😂
Maguire one only GOAT in the world
1:15 Mount shouting at England defenders to press and stop Kai from shooting...dude know the class of his bestfriend Kai
Harry maguire stupid
Tnq maguire😌
What a goal Kai Havertz👏👏👏
Maguire😄😄😄😄
It's home already!
Terstegen es un mounstro!!Bestial!!Clase top!!Todos mis respetos!!
Maguire at it again. Look at united..the moment they left him out they started to win.. the guy must be the most useless defender ever.
Good job Maguire ( pemain idola southgate n Ole)
I love the German kit. Kinda reminds me of Ajax but instead of red stripe it’s is a black stripe . Sick kit!
I swear Harry Pinero is better than Maguire.
Harry Maguire the gift that keeps on giving 🎁
I swear the camera is switch it different with other highlights
2 x  Maguire membuat kesalahan 😔
Maguire again 😂😂😂 Kenapa para pelatih selalu memilih dia??  Buta apa gimana?
How did Maguire become a footballer in the first place🤔
Maguire is the highest paid footballer since he is playing for two teams
I pray to the God that Maguire will leave Manchester united.
How is Maguire still getting picked 🤷‍♂️ he's useless.
Why did McGuire hug his opponent's striker? when entering the penalty area at all times ?
I think it will be an easy decision to replace meguaire with ben white
These guys are playing so well for there country! Fantastic football
Master class by Lord Maguire and Lord Southgate
Classic Meguire
The commentary
The only thing German about Harry Mcguire is the shape of his head.
Maguire will receive a medal of courage from Germany for his effort in balancing the game equally.
Why is maguire playing ahead of Fikayo?
Maguire😅
The worst defender in the world
Why can't Kai do v that for Chelsea
Harry Maguire is a joke
And they say Hairy Shitguire always performs when he plays for England and so he did. 😂
LORD MAGUIRE 😂😂😂😂
Great england
Maguire 😅😂🤣
Gareth Southgate is crazy how can he start Harry Kane and Maguire while young lads like Saka are on the bench.
Pure biased match how it could be a penalty as the ball first touched with German defender ...
Ter steagn what a gk 😂 If Neuer on the post then score line might had difference
MAGUIRE ALWAYS BE A WEAK LINK EVEN WHEN HE PLAY FOR ENGLAND
guess who's back?
Saka 🥂
GERMANY DEFENCE MUST BE IMPROVED.
Get it so good Harry MaGuire
musiala vs bellingham
HARRY DID HARRY................
Maguire titipan pejabat setempat
Cant believe Maguire is playing ahead of Ben White.
Forget Ronaldo and Messi. Maguire is the most consistent player in recent history. What a defender.
Sterling is a bad finisher overrated
Bruhh that pen from kane top left
How he got harassed by a 19 year old is just beyond me🤣🤣 But this guy has been a fraud for ages. Glad he's finally getting exposed. Long may it continue 💪🏾
Ramsdale is better than Pope, what’s going on GS
Harry maguire 🤣🤣🤣
Enough with the Maguire banter. Let's talk football. 😡😤
And thus, Southgate is sacked the morning after...
Legend Maguire
The voicethe commentator's voice does not show the atmosphere of the match
I never knew Germany played 12 players with Maguire as their extra man .
No 5 wkwkwkw🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wah.. dimana mana Meguire terkenal dengan bakatnya, sampai ke Indonesia. Berbahagialah lawan jika bertemu engkau di lapangan, kerja sama yang baik.🇮🇩🌟
maguire😅🤦🤦
Maguire please retire hahahahh, nowadays football is not meant for u
Except for England's 2nd goal, the rest will not make Gareth a decent coach. It's not Harry, why only point on Harry. He and Gareth both need to go. The coach should shoulder the playing tactics. Watch Germany's 2nd goal. The guy had ample time to place it at the top corner. He stopped, looked and kicked. He even had time to wave it to Gareth before he scored🤣
Any other defender that has been performing like Maguire would be investigated for match fixing.  However Maguire has made it look so natural in conceding all this "mistakes" and no one has blamed him for any chance of match fixing.   What a talent..
Every player would love a player like Maguire on the pitch. Every opposition player, that is.
Can we all agree that Maguire was Germany’s best player last night? He’s definitely going to the World Cup. It’s coming home?
Maguire and Pope won it for Germany.
😁🤣lord maguire😬🤣😔
The real G.O.A.T is Maguire every player want to score, and Maguire help you
Lord maguwayer always be full senyum..🤭😂
<<No Look Defending>>   —— 2022 By Harry Maguire
Germany 🇩🇪🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺💖
Germany 🇩🇪⚽💪🏻
Harry maguire🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The reason Southgate like maguire is because they are the "old school"englishman. . the polite ,the arrogant 😁😅🤣🤣🤣.. southgate will be polite with maguire for picking him & arrogant for not listening to the press,fans & neutrals not to pick maguire.
what a game !! 진짜 명승부다
Este partido fue filmado y relatado como un juego de fifa 2022 🤣😂
Die deutsche Mannschaft ist die beste der Welt.
Deutschland das Beste der Welt 🇩🇪⚽💪🏻
Incredible,i hope Germany can be show best perfomance at the world cup Qatar,Good luck Flick 💪😍🇩🇪
komm Deutschland das fängt gerade erst an 💪🏻⚽🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪
The thing Maguire does for charity is worth a standing ovation.
That's hordy Maguirer is a German team player
Lord Maguire look like king of defender today ..
Tq agent Maguire you done very well to help the team😂😂😂😂
This stupid maguire
Wasit asal Belanda 🇳🇱 🧠 selalu berkelas dunia 🧡👍👏🦁
Trent would be a better centre back than Maguire.
Why havert can't finish like this at Chelsea
According to harry maguire close related 1. Harry loses the ball is not his fault, its cause their team mates don’t want to take the ball from him. 2. Penalty was not harry’s fault. It was nick pope, cause he can’t stop it.  3. If harry play for germany, ter-stegen will struggle to compete with him. 4. England lose is not harry’s fault, its the whole team including manager, coaches, royals, peoples, media and deutschen 😳😳😳😳🫣🫣🫣🫢
U are clown Maguire 👎🏼
Germany will be out after 1st round. This WC goes to South American.
Harry Maguire has earned 1.2 million views in 5 hours. What a legend!!
King Maguire 🙏🏽🙏🏽
Pahlawan sebenarnya adalah maguire👏👏
Maguire world best central defender of all time .
and tomari?
チェルサポにはたまらん試合だな
maguire is incredible his bodies must be placed at house of wax
Lord Maguire did it again😂😂😂😂
1:02. Damn! why don't leagues use that FIFA penalty camera. 🔥🔥
Just by having him on the sheet, Maguire significantlt boosts confidence......to the other team.
Have you noticed only Premier league players scored
อังกฤษน่าจะแพ้ไปเลย
someone educate me plz: why is it a penalty when the german defender's foot hit the ball before hitting the english player?
Lionel Messi will eat Maguire alive if England were to play Argentina in knockout matches.
Was at the match and my 11 year old nephew was complaining how sh*t Maguire is and Southgate Out and Tuchel In.
Pope very bad, next to the coach for the house Pope ( arquero ) muy malo, junto al entrenador para la casa Pd. Bellingham y Rice mounstruos 💪💪
매과이어 역시 기대를 져버리지 않네
Maguire is one of example. We no need talent no need hardworking but we can stay at the higher level. Such a stupid role model for maguire
Maguire crazy lord 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That was the classic penalty of kane 😉
Maguire should have a Guinness world record for being the worst player in football history
Maguire in every team 💀
Southgate should have to learn from Erik, bench Maguire and give chance to other defenders. Then only his defence will stop conceding goals. Maguire doesn't know the basics of defending. He was just vibing around and there.
not fair...germany played whit 12 player's
harry maguire badut
Maguire maguire maguire ...
Super match😎
Oh the strikers who played and r playing in Chelsea dominated the game. I think they scored all goal for this season today.
케인은 페널티킥만 차는구나
Maguire 😂 what a defender?
Maguire nearly broke the German player leg.
Harry Maguire hahahahahahahaha
thats why havertz is a cam
Tough game both teams could of win 🙌🏻
Everyone went home after this game. Maguire went to see his therapist.
lord maguire world class defender lol. think any league one defender can be as good as him
well done, Harry... Maguire
Maguire 🐐
Too pre-mature guys not yet world class... These talented players have yet taken on first class team of African, then they will go to next level to face Latin American Greats before they can be crowned as World Class unless they're already won Ballon D'or.. just a domestic players otherwise..
Remember McGuire getting into a fight at a night club telling the bouncers do you know who I am 🤣  Ps... Southgate trying to play it cool like his job isn't on the line 🤣  What to do ?  Do you guys think there is enough time for a new coach to steer the 🦁 🦁 🦁  to A decent world cup ? No more cheating with 2 balls or ball boys or broken VAR  Or should they stick with Southgate and his boyfriend Harry Potter ?
the lord maguire🤣🤣🤣
Haha Harry Maguire 😂😂 sân out
Chelsea should sign Harry Maguire
Super
england : bad coach, GK, maguire
1:37 Exact same goal from Shaw at the Euros
Maguire is a great player who is off his game -- but he WILL get his game back!
Maguire lagi dan lagi...
Top Player = harry maguire
Wow luke shaw!
Harry Maguire with red uniform = unnecessary stupid blunder....
hArRy mAgUiRe iS aCtUaLLy cLaSs fOr eNgLaNd
haryyyy maguireee lollll
Not an easy game for England playing against Germany and Maguire at the same time.
That is why i dont like Harry Maguire. He played casually at the box. He is best fit at the substitution bench
what about to go Germany on next round??
Thank you Germany and England for the beautiful match 😍😍
Why southgate ??? U' have another Defenders
As MU fans proud to see our players made great impact. For both teams...
Sir Maguire is a real asset for opponent teams... Welldone
MAGUIRE PLAYS WITH JUSTICE.  THANKS VERY MUCH FOR BEING CONSTANT AND HELP ALL TEAMS TO SCORE
The commentator was just like Harry maguire!
Why they keep playing shity Maguire
Maguire, unreplaceable.
Why England still need HM for what?
Ter Stegen 🔥🔥
Who came here just for Maguire? (I'm writing this comment even before I've watched the highlights.) :D
I don't know why Germany can't hold their score 2-0, and almost lost 3-2..need a big evalution from Hansi Flick
Harry Mcguire scored 2 goals for Germany tonight....what a player he is
Coaches has to put Maguire in the line up to make football entertaining.  People are always waiting articles and videoes after his matches.
maguire🤣
Harry maguire out....
After all Maguire mistakes - everyone knew about it but I still don’t know why they put him in the first squad

Haverts is so underrated
89 mins at Wembley and all Germans are still attacking..this Highline they play for years now is very suicidal ...And they still have no proper strikers.
Can someone explain to me why Maguire is an England national team player?
It's Havertz season🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Chelsea show as usual🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🔥
Maguire, Dyer's the defense ,    No comment
Kmaren nyalain de Gea gara gara bahasa  Sekarang nyalahin sapa lagi ? Rumput licin ?!
a country like England and a lot of star-studded players can't qualify for the next round hahaha, let alone qualify, they end up at the bottom of the standings haha.
แม๊กซ์​ไก่​วโครตกาก
maguire lord edan
Maguire showed his class yet once again.
And then magurie claim he is ruben dias level 🤣🤣🤣🤣 respect tenhag 💯🙏🏼
Harry maguire is the best defender in the world everyone wants to play against him🔥
Everyone speaks about Maguire , but Pope made that mistake which was costly for England
Harry 'lord' Maguire 10/10 MoTM
Herr Maguire
Harry Maguire is an endless source of inspiration for strikers
Maguire idol 😍
Yg ngegoolin pemain premier league
Harry Maguire the english nightmare. 🤣
Both the teams are a mess. None of the European teams are ready for the world cup. If you can't beat England here then good luck beating Spain in the world cup.
MVP : HM dan Pope😆
We need more maguire, please dont drop him. Pure entertaining
Its good time for Harry Mg ,to close all social media,youtube and Televison
When Pope tries to save the penalty, he imitated the goalkeepers of Dream League Soccer
Maguire player of the match for germany..lol
0:38 seriously, why is maguire receiving minutes with England??
The most aaa annoying aaa voice aaa ever aaa!!!!
No number 9 for Germany and it shows how lacking it can make a team look
Magurie is a world class contender for ballon d or
Maguire childhood dream comes true, all times most loved and cherished player in the UK. . Bravo!
2 incredible save by Ter ,, wonderfull
Thrilling and pulsating game full with drama and entertainment. Wonderful display of skills by Saka. His performance catalyzed England attack.
Wow just wow still playing Maguire 😅😂😂😅
Announcer is wack
Pop plays better in the premiere league
🤣🤣🤣 Harry McGuire should warm up the bench instead of playing in the field.
Ster Stegen is back 💪🏾
instead of NP, DH should play as GK. Poor distribution.
When Maguire start you are 2 - Nil Up🤣🤣
"Harry Maguire " super stupid 😂
Harry Maguire!
Maguire 💣
My only problem now is Maguire have to return to man utd, dear Southgate, can you just keep him?
Jeeeez ter stergen finger tip save of the game
Kai Havertz goal was stunning Chelsea are very lucky to have him talented player harry maguire should be England captain is the leader of the English national team
Maguire will always be remembered for inventing modern day classical defending. What a genius!
Why does the commentator sound like he’s constipated
Que pena para las dos selecciones!! ALEMÁNIA por un lado iba ganando 0-2 y lo empataron en un lapso de 10 minutos, eso es vergonzoso que una selección de ese calibre la empaten. Por otra parte es una infamia que a los anglosajones, británicos o ingleses después de ir ganando 3-2 le empaten el partido casi de último minuto. En conclusión fue un gran partido aunque Inglaterra no gano ni uno y por si fuera poco descendió a la liga B!! Que pena por ellos, pero más pena me da ALEMÁNIA!!
Renació Alemania
VAMOS
It looks like England and Harry kane need a Son...🤔🤔🤔😳😳😳Son>>>Raheem Sterling🤔🤔🤔🥺🥺🥺😓😓😓
🇧🇷🤘🏻
Maguire is gonna cost Southgate his job. Southgate needs to save himself by dropping Maguire to the bench
ถ้าอยากประสบความสำเร็จในฟุตบอล ทีมต้องไม่มีแม็คไกวร์
Southgate: ok,enough,,no maguire on World Cup 🤭🤭
Went straight to the comment after Maguire, you know, did his job
Wow Maguire
Wtf are England in red at home
Havartz plz start playing like that in a Chelsea shirt!!!!
Mcguire is maldini x 10
Kekocakan yang di miliki inggris 😂 🤣 maguwayerr
Sterling is a beast
Who was that German player in red? 🤣😂
Maguire the utd legend 😅🤣🤣🤣
Harry Maguire. Who else.. By now he should realise playing professional football is not his childhood dream.
3 🐭 🐭 🐭
Southgate out
schlotterbeck, pemain yang sangat senang menyebabkan pinalti ke Jerman.. flick harus berani memasang arme posisi cbl, dua cb jerman terlihat lambat mengantisipasi counter dari inggris.. skuad qatar 2022 adalah pemain sedang top form di klub... 🇮🇩❤🇩🇪🏆🏆🏆🏆⭐⭐⭐⭐
GOAT HARRY at his very best he deserves the Ballon Defense🎉
Speed tackles better than Maguire
Maguire is the greatest comedian of his time
บ่าวเเม็กจัดให้
Maguire haha
Congratulation southgate for choosing hary maguaire 😂
and people want pope to be england number 1... i think hes shown that hes not quite there yet
If it was fair, England would have had 5 at least.
maguire giving away free goals yet again, surprise
Southgate haha should be sack when he introduced sancho and rasford for penalty in euro
แมคควาย555
If England coach was good they could even win world cup.
Heri main ngeri pokok e
Maquire is very talented player in the world.. He will win Best FIFA Football Awards
German defence is not strong yet  , They will have to fix this soon
Dm hary max hài
KING KAI
Maguire man of the match
I truly don’t get it. Why in the world would a sane person keep using Harry Maguire? Why!?
Nick pope did really bad i wish southgate brought pickpord
Told you .. ( De gea )
Maguire si lawak hahaha
The commentator has no reactions
2:55 what a romantic moment 😍❤️
Saka 🤩
Things on Earth may change but Harry Maguire will never change !
1:21 Kai Havertz is left footed!
maguire udah ga ada obat deh kalau blunder 😂
Why can’t the commentator speak properly? Says er after most sentences.
southgate favourite boy always delivered😂
Havertz plays well with Werner, it's still confused me that Chelsea sold Werner.
Why Harry Maguire still plays?
Cc
2 mins silence for me and those who miss the match.
Well. This is what England can make as the Premier League is the best league in the world, but, the best teams is formed by the best players of other countries
Maguire rubbish 😂
Harry Maguire .. truly world class for Germany
또 매과이어야? ㅋㅋㅋ 개거품..
Harry kane is not no.1 striker . change  striker.
Việt Nam vô địch 🇻🇳
Maguire and England goalkeeper were heroes for the Germany.
Havertz ever play like that for Chelsea?
매과이어 진짜 대단하다
Maguire MVP
Guys stop mocking Maguire, I'm tired of liking them all 😮‍💨
🤣🤣 how on earth will england play well with Maguire
Butterfingers pope, Pickford England's number 1
Why have ter stegen when you have neuer 🤦🏻‍♂️
Maguire being himself..
0:38 THE BEST ASSIST EVER IN THE WORLD 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's got embarrassing for Maguire now. Completely made a fool of for penalty. Pub league challenge.
If Maguire goes to the World Cup I’m renouncing my British citizenship.
England Zindabad ✊
Chelsea must change the way they play... to much backpass...defender goin up , overcrowd oponent box.. where attacking cannot do anyhthing waiting passing ball.. which make any world class striker/attacking Midfielder useless.. then defender easily fatigue when come back for defending..hence poor defender.. those stiker/mid when play for other club looks more dangerous..exp salah, kevin de, etc
Maguire is becoming the most bullied player in modern days
00:38 Maguire ???
Maguire tolol
England should stop listing Maguire. He is useless as always.
Goat Maquire back to form
Sterling kick with you right foot before the gk set
Is this the beginning of the end of Mcguire's career?
Kai Havertz always the best German player
Another highlight for Harry Maguire.
To improve, now he just needs to injure Kane in practice so he can gain the captaincy.
Wkkwkwk Maguire
What A move from the Defender Harry Maguire, he gave two assist for Germany, Awesome Suck Def LOl
He is the one who keep the top range from United to England
Awokwok Maguire again 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Striker lawan "kami membutuhkan Maguire untuk mencetak banyak gol" 😁
They staying home again
Germany on bench : “easy lads, we have maguire in our side, just wait his magic and boom, we can win”
If they’d have played ramsdale and white instead of pope and maguire we’d have won.
What A Harry Maguire!
Harry Maguire, your defense is terrifying)))
แม็คไกวสร้างผลงานอีกแล้วครับบ
Man, I'm so done with Maguire. Stupid mistake and foul resulted in Germany's first goal. Then, you could see the 2nd goal when Maguire was in Van Dijk mode, only watching Havertz control and shoot the ball without marking him, even Shaw had to cover for Maguire while marking another player....
No.5 eng world class !!! -_-
Kiper lawak ditambah bek lawak
After tonight’s performance. He’s definitely getting back on Man Utd starting 11!
Pickford needs to start for pope
Harry Maguire 🤣🤣🤣🤣 World class defender ...Who brings him to the field to play 🤣
bro that final save from ter stegen, was crazy, brushed his fingertips nice save. the only negative point of ter stegen's performance which i can find was luke shaw's goal, it was savable, not a hard save. the other 2 goals he really couldnt do much. the mason mount goal was not really savable and that harry kane penalty is a nightmare for any goalkeeper, right into the top corner.
No, the two goals for England weren't created from the 'right hand side of England's defence' and No Reece James wasn't out of position, while also standing there and watching when they took the shots....
ㅋㅋ 매과이어
0:48 맹구안목 굉장하다
What is going on with this commentators voice? Sounds like he’s straining so hard
Nice leg kick by Maguire
Sakaaaa.
I hate this Barcelona Keeper
Hari maguwaier titipan pemda setempat wkkwkw

maguire lawak
Imagine the world in which are we living,where Harry Maguirre is worth 80 milion £
맥과이어 ㅋ ㅋ

How in the 7 hells maguire keep playing in top football teams  Its just unbelievable
That penalty was beautiful
Harry maguire king of comedy
Every forward would love to play against Harry Maguire. Such a legend
Maguire...😅😅😅😂😂😂😂 lol
Maguire 🤣🤣🤣
What is this commentary
Ngak di klub ngak di timnas lor maguire selalu bikin ketar ketir lini belakang
rubbish Maguire
All hail Lord Maguire
when maguire plays he will make everyone happy..
Harry Maguire, proving a point, as usual! Now let the press speak for him, instead of the football.
Para marcar penalti no era necesario que el árbitro lo fuera a ver. Ese  uso del VAR decepciona.
What a game!
Harry Maguire is The real GOAT 🐐..
Maguire emang jos gandos mantap jiwa.. Wkwkwkwkwk
Harry meguayarr 😌
Sterling 🙄😂🤣😂👍 Maguire 🙄😂🤣😂👍
Maguaire yang salalu konsisten dengan lawakanya 🤣
Maguire 😴😴😴
Maguire is world class defender but Trent is not suitable in this team defender. goal different in table say everything.
What a trademark from harry maguire, long time no see his pure talent .
No, seriously now.....HOW IS HARRY MAGUIRE A "PROFESSIONAL" FOOTBALLER? Someone please help me understand this!!!
funny Maguire  XD
What a comeback from England!!! When they were 0-2 down, many were have thought England was finished!! But what a come back from them!! From 0-2 to lead 3-2!!! But a pity the Germans level at 3-3 in e 87min!!!! If not will be  a famous win from England!!!
harry world class
Maguire sedang melawak lagi guys. Bahkan level tim nasional sekalipun 🤡
Just after Maguire moved to United I thought, "Well, he is a great guy with a bright future." Now every commentator, pundit and youtuber makes horrible fun of him. I started to feel sorry for him. Then I watched a few games. I had no idea. On the first goal he is ridiculously clumsy, on the second goal he is actually hiding behind another defender and does not even jump up like the guy to his left. Essentially not even in the play. Did someone give him a retirement gift? This would not even count as skillfully throwing a game for gambling organizations. It feels like he worked hard at Leicester to get to United and then committed the cardinal mistake of thinking, "all my hard work has made it to the top, now I do not have to work hard anymore."
Germans must be proud of its best footballer, Mr. Harry GOAT Maguire
So many words were against Harry Maguire!!! He was attacked again in e comments area!!! LOL😆....sorry don't mean to be rude!!
Football legend maguire one in a decade ✨✨✨
Maguir pahlawan bagi german
The art of defense is Harry Maguire
If ter stegen was not there,england would have won
I love maguire...
maguire 🤡
There are 3 million defenders in England, Harry Maguire is the chosen one. The best English player.
ทำไมต้องด่า แม็กไวค์ด้วยครับ
Maguire maguire maguire is magician for germany 👍👍
Harry maguire earns £190000 a week. It will take the average brit nearly 8 years to earn what that oaf earns in a single week.  Or, he will earn more in 2 months than the average brit will earn in their entire working life.  Or, at nearly £10million a year, the average brit would have to work for 400 years to earn that same amount.  Let that sink in.
Mugwayer pro germany 🤣
"You and the ball, one must stay" - Lord Maguire
byoung shin
Serious question here - what's the rationale behind starting Harry freaking Maguire?
I hope someone of less extraordinary-ability comes to replace the skill that of Maguire soon.
Gareth southgate will certainly make sure England is out as soon as possible from WC with Maguire on pitch.
Oh no Maguire come back 😳😳
โคตรดีใจเลย นักเตะเชลซี ฮาแวต เมาส์  ยิงประตูได้ หวังว่าจะกลับมาทำผลงานได้ดีอีกครั้งกับเชลซี
Harry maguire again........
Neuer no more?? 😢
Maguire class in the work 😂
Stop playing Maguire and Pope I really hope Pickford is back in for the World Cup as he’s miles ahead of rams dale and pope when it comes to internationals
HM.....what a legend!
And they sitting ben white at home for maguire👏
MAGUAIER beban
Sir Maguire 🤣🤡. I think this guy has some links upstairs.
Maguire  ia man of the match 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
how is england's last goal a penalty? can someone please explain???
Where is Tomori?
Get Ivan toney in no more words
Germany is the most powerful team in world 🌎
Tao lạy mày hai ơi
Happy to see mount score a goal 💙💙
Couldn't find a win against a top opponent at home. Take the U21s to the WC please, you'll have a better chance of getting out of the group
Maguire maguire 😏
Pov: UR looking for a comment that doesn't have Maguire in it
Tolong pertahanan Jerman di perbaiki
The home team should NEVER have to wear anything other than their home kit.
Migoreng masih aja di mainkan..
Maguire should just quit football forever
No trent no hope
Ter stegan 😅😅
마구이레.. 너란 남자 정말
Ben white has been exceptional this season for arsenal (top of the table) and the lord Maguire is still playing ahead of him🙄🙄 manager open your eyes....
Both team kit looks horrible
Can' we just give Maguire breathing space.
maguire for ballon d Or
As always maguire in top form heading into the World Cup! Lol
ㅋㅋㅋ 사람들 하고는 전부 매과이어 칭찬뿐이네
harry Maguire double agent
Rigged game...
@0:37 best England Defender ever !he should start at the World Cup 😂
From 996 comments 900 comments are about Maguire.
We would have won if it wasn't for slab head Maguire..how does this clown keep getting games of football..? I wouldn't pick him in a game at the park.
Maguire lawak 😂😂😂
Maguire, the mole again!
Germany's defense looks really bad compared to the Euros. Looks like there's no Chem there. Wonder if Flick looks to Hummels. Also can't imagine Ginter not starting in the WC. But who knows. Just hope they clean up the defensive struggles.
As a fan of football, I am so proud of Maguire 🎉🎉🎉🎉, never have there been a defender so effective in creating goals⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️
Again again and again.... Harry maguire
Kai Havertz 👍👍👍 good player
Hari maguwayer best defender in the world
กลับเเมนยูฯ.. นั่งสำรองยาวแน่นอน ไอ้แม็กซ์
Pelatih kolot tetap masang maguire, lawak lawak
BROOOOO CAN'T BELIEVE MAGUIRE IS PLAYING OVER TOMORI FOR ENGLAND 😅😅😅 SOUTHGATE WTF ARE YOU DOING?
harry maguire is the best🤣🤣🤣
해리 매과이어~ 발좀 내밀지 마
Sterling gỗ quá
Harry Maguire is still the same person before being benched by United. Slow with unnecessarily risky play.
Havertz is so good
Hahaha Lord Maguire .. lol
Man of the match : Harry maguire 😂😂
maguayer tod
Still wondering why Aaron Ramsdale is not having a chance to be the competitor for England no.1. Why opt for a mid-table goalkeeper?
harry maguire~~~~
Si no es por terstegen le meten 7
As a United fan, i can only said this "now you guys know how we feel when Harry is on the pitch".
For many many years I'm telling people Harry is a joke of the player! After Vidic, Ferdinand, Neville brothers and other great players, MU signed a bust for a abnormal 80 mill. WHY? No body knows. Sorry for the MU and even bigger sorry for England national team. He simply is not a good player, not even average one and why is he still in the MU and captain? What top level performance he had in the last years? NONE! Always in trouble, he's legs are not parts of he's body, he's head is away all the time! Not a single match he played is without problems that he make! Many people says he was the best player on the opponent team and they are right! So please MU get him fired already!
Don't know why everyone is so hard on Harry Maguire... he has shown his consistency 👏  for Club and Country
Maguire giving the ball away and giving a penalty for the first goal, and got caught out so high up the field for the second...
สดจริงแมคควาย😁😁😁
Harry Maguire is not a bad player,he just needs a world classs manager to tell him to retire.
Gareth Southgate thinks he's running a donkey sanctuary, not the England national team. Result: Harry Maguire.
I tought it was just a meme but how tf is maguire in the national team?
Maguire  should be made the coach of Both national and club team . He is too good to be playing on the pitch
3 goals frm Chelsea man..kemah keming boh...MUng adet?
There's no player as consistent as Harry Maguire. My man never deviates from disappointing you as long as he is on the pitch!
Harry there's a vacancy for a defender at " The Dog and Duck"  eleven.  I suggest that you take it Maguire because that's all that you are good for.
Pertandingan yang sangat luar biasa. Harry menunjukkan permainan hebat nya. On fire.. 👍
Maguire for Ballon d'Or
Maguire is getting better and better after every game 😂
Maguire world class pass to musiala !!
Sumpah si mujaer selalu jadi ampas maupun di klub atau timnas😂😂😂
Might as well start betting on Maguire to assist the opposing team as it happens every game he plays now.
แฮรี่ แมคไกว อ่ะะะะะะะ

Maguire has some little problem
ndk di club ndk di negara maguire lawak terus
Harry Maguire! You legend! You beauty
แม็กไกว ห่วยแตก ยังเอามาเล่นอีก
Musiala is another one Chelsea will regret letting go, isnt he? 😞
The number 6 defender of his team kicked like a chicken with rice. The world football tournament is coming. If the England team still lets this guy kick, then prepare a ticket now to go back to the country soon.
I love how everyone has been commenting about how Maquire contributed to help Germany win, King Maquire 👑 at His Royal best 😆
ไอ้แม็กวาอยู่ที่ชิบหายที่นั้น
¡El jersey de Alemania esta hermoso!
i'm thinking maguire's slower than laurent blanc when he came to utd in 2001...seriously he'll cover 100m in 17secs at best
Maguire man of the “his match”
Came to read the comments on the Maguire show😂😂 what a player 😅
Who else the hero Macquire
0:38 Maguire🤣🤣🤣🤣
Maguire again :[
The title should be read like this: Incredible Harry Maguire Created 2 Important Goals at Wemguire
Lord Maguire 😂😂😂
WTF ! Saka are you fu*king doing ?
It’s coming home 😅
When u put ter Station on the field u r already 1-0 down
Ter stegen tiene que ser titular yaaaa.
Germany 2nd goal : maguire should’ve close the gap to havertz to stop him from shooting, not just looking and giving him a chance to shoot
What a game
McGuire from talent to below average means Voodoo magic is involved. Logical explanation
Wow that penalty for England tho 😮. What is this sport turning into 😂😂
Southgate is truly one of the greatest coach-manager to be the only one who can see the real talent of Maguire and still giving Maguire chance after chance until 5 or maybe 10 years more.
Harry Maguire MOTM 🔥
Really good players
Can we please get Peter Dury back.......pretty please.

The lord clown maguire the best defender in england.  Thank you maguire.
Highlights game of two half,in a six goal shout out, finishing 3-3. Now uses know to why Maguire not been pick for Man Utd, absolute dumb tackle in the box.
Please leave maguire alone, if you can do better you would be in the squad

Well done England playing with 10 men vs Germany 12 men to get a draw.
England sorely missed Pickford here. And really could have done better than including Maguire. How did people ever think he was a top player?!
ไม่ขาดหวังไม่ผิดหวัง
Wow that was great match, Thriller from start to end.
USA gonna beat England at the world cup 2022 and we call it Soccer
Spillt dësen Narr oder den deiersten Verteideger op der Welt.Harry maguire
Maguire lagi wkwkwk
I wonder if Maguire can still play for national team and one of the biggest club in the world, and he's getting paid more than $200k per week How much worthy I am as a young and best alumni of a master degree for my almamater
𝗧𝗛𝗔𝗡𝗞 𝗬𝗢𝗨 𝗠𝗔𝗚𝗨𝗜𝗥𝗘 🙏🏼😂😛😛
Money mase. Absolute class of a finish.
3 draws 1 defeat for Germany in the last 5 games, japan has a gd chance of going through with spain
Southgate is like thanks for saving me from being fired...
How do I filter out Maguire comments?🤣

Harry Maguire is the worst defender I’ve seen in ages
Outstanding by Harry miguire
Kane amazing penalty😱
Jajaja inútil Maguire lo hizo de nuevo 🤣🤣
Maguire selalu tampil beda dan sangat berkelas.. 😁
Que grande el capitán del MU
england wil be one of the most dangerous team this coming world cup i guarantee you that
Im so sick of people defending Harry. He's garbage and deserves the abuse.
Harry maguer 🤡🤡🤣🤣
0:38 🤦
Maguire is out of this world this match 🥰
La maldición de Brasil le llega Alemania , desde el 2014 nada de nada
𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗟𝗘𝗚𝗘𝗡𝗗 𝗠𝗔𝗚𝗨𝗜𝗥𝗘 💪🏼💪🏼😛😜😂
Good performance from Harry Maguire as always 🥰
i can't take England seriously as a championship contender as long as they keep playing Harry Maguire... lol
Thx maguire from germany 🤣
𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗟𝗘𝗚𝗘𝗡𝗗 𝗠𝗔𝗚𝗨𝗜𝗥𝗘 💪🏼💪🏼😛😜
Lord Maguire is ever ready to entertain  us . He's pure comedy🤡
Best CB in the world right now HM🤗
Lord maguire
Maguire blame De Gea saying he can’t speak English, maybe Pope can’t speak English too 😒
The funniest part is when the great Maguire tries to prevent the man he fouled to give up the penalty, from falling 😂
Harry meguire 🤣🤣🤣
all goals from premier league players, WHAT A GAME!!🔥
Thank god Germany have lords Maguire 😂
Maguire should not  shoulder all the blame, the MANAGER's decision to play him was the wrong decision!
0:37 Some of the worst defending from a Centre Half you will ever see in your life. I'm literally lost for words. Maguire will single handedly ruin Englands world cup. If Southgate starts him, there is literally no hope what so ever.
Maguire must have something on southgate... maybe some nudes or so
Mcguire😂
England need Pickford  back or much better keeper
HARRY MAGUIRE, THE CAPTAIN BENCH
I don't understand why England's Coach recruited him the M5. Probably according to the theory of "failure is called success". Being eliminated at WC2022 is called a success?
Selama masih ada maguire ga bakal Bisa menang Inggris mah
해리 맹과이어ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 진짜 ㅈ같이 못한다
Lord Maguire 🐐🐐🐐
Harry maguire should stop playing football and focus on the memes
God knows this Pope dive ehnn If it was Pickford the second and third goal no fit score
Maguire,king of assists. Ben White,a solid back, nowhere to be seen. Southgate?
Another brilliant performance by goat magurie🥰
How bad do you want the commentary to be Commentator: Yes
Harry maguire GOAT😍
Kai 🔥 Mount 💪
moukoko in
He went for 3 cb’s and only one of them deserved to be there
Harry Maguire can't catch a break lol
Maguire make a same mistake again?.Come on Southgate, what is in ur mind?  What is so special about him?lots of questions here.
𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗟𝗘𝗚𝗘𝗡𝗗 𝗠𝗔𝗚𝗨𝗜𝗥𝗘 💪🏼💪🏼😛😜
Oops Maguire did it again
Hello German football why do you have a  n English commentary on your highlights
How Is maguire a professional footballer and plays football at the highest level still i dont know. This is a mystery.
Picking maguire ahead inform white is really ridiculous.. I think Southgate is biased.
𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗟𝗘𝗚𝗘𝗡𝗗 𝗠𝗔𝗚𝗨𝗜𝗥𝗘 🙏🏼💪🏼😁😁
omg Maguire 🤦‍♂
Harry Maguire manages to play for two teams at the same time. World class
He's just doing his manchester captain duties... 😂😂
Crysi coak shoget koplak
come on Germany, you had 12 men and still can't win this? to be fair, Maguire was wearing England kit so that can be confusing 🤣🤣.
𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗟𝗘𝗚𝗘𝗡𝗗 𝗠𝗔𝗚𝗨𝗜𝗥𝗘 💪🏼✊🏼😛😜
Napoli Kim >>>>> Manutd Maguire 😂
Legendary LORD Maguire never disappoint
Harry Maguire😂😂😂😂
Saka on his right foot is not what you expect from someone worth any millions..
The legend Harry Maguire never fails to disappoint his 200 millions followers in yt😂
Bro said ‘on his left foot aswel’ like Havertz isn’t left footed😂
England conceding 3 -  that's championship level defending.
Indeed... Germany still have a big problems in their attacking and defending...
Commentator is comical
"Maguire always idiot"  I know my word is bad, but I think every people in this planet is agree..
Damn
Makes a simple pass mistake, causes a penalty 😭 Harry the goat maguire is a scam at this point. I would have retired from football..this is beyond believable
Havertz world class goal
I'm worried about us German fans.. We've been playing poorly for quite a long time now.. I get it that we are just undergoing a phase, but it's worrying.. Hopefully, Hans can turn around our form before the world cup, because we are in a tough group, and if we were to play like this, going home from in the group stage again would certainly happen.. We have to regain our form, these players are talented, but they are not working hard enough, look how sloppy and effortless they were in the 1st half.. This is absolutely unacceptable!!!
Maguire again.. Eng played against 12 men germans. Lol
25minutes before a hint of a highlight..ffs england
Que bueno es maguirre fútbol , talento , estado puro de jugador clase jaha
Agent maguire is at it again..
The Maguire situation cannot carry on he is shot to pieces, Southgate has to find two centre halves who can play together within the next three months, good luck with that one.
Saka always bottles at crucial final moments smh.
What a stupid-voiced commentary.
Pope just lost his place...
Thanks haaaarrryyyyyyy m 😘😘😘😘😘
Southgate continues to play maguire knowing he isn’t good enough to play in this or any team .
Ramsdale should come in for Pope. Pope is not good enough to be England number 1 or compete with Pickford and Ramsdale. At best he is a 3rd choice keeper.
Maguire is a comedy
Hary maguere 🤮
World class Harry Maguire 🤣🤣   most terrible player in the world.
สุดยอดเยอรมันที่รัก
Pope over pickford really? Pick Ford diffrent class when plays for country 🤦‍♂️
What a Rolls Royce defender Harry margiure is !!!  WE CANNOT REPLACE HIM - Pep 😢
Lord maguire😎
Harry THE CLOWN  Maguire is the Twelve player of Germany.
Harry  Maguire so dumb.
Harry Maguire~~~~!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Maguire - Generous, provides several media houses and YouTube channels great content to put out daily. Without him, they would struggle to put food on their tables. What a legend. respect Sir Harry OBE.
🤣🤣 Maguire
Maguire the best player for Germany 😎😎😎😎😎😎
매과이어 폼 다죽고 선발도 못나오고 저래 못하는데 국대 선발로쓰는 우드게이트는 재정신인가? ㅋㅋㅋ
Maguire is on another level
0-1 Gundogan (P) 0-2 Havertz 1-2 Shaw 2-2 Mount 3-2 Kane (P) 3-3 Havertz
Maguire 😂😂
What a performance. Southgate needs to wash his eyes with bleach if he doesn't take Maguire.
Although Chelsea have been having a bit of a rough time, Mount, And Havertz were brilliant. They showed how they play on the world stage.
Maguire is a magnet of disaster 😂
Kai 😍
I’m pretty happy for this match. Chelsea lads 💙💙
Maguire 2 goal 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤣🤣🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
How is Maguire still playing? Mistake after mistake, blunder after blunder. The man needs a rest, he needs time away from the limelight, because at this rate he's going to be bantered for the rest of his career if not his life. It's almost cruel to keep playing him.
Maguire Hugging Werner for the last goal. He always deliver...lol
Maguire lol
"On his left foot as well"?? He is a lefty, ffs.
If Harry Maguire can still play for England, then I am the next in line to the British throne!
Its a right carry on when harrys on lol
Musiala Elite
Nick pope disappointing back to back games. I would’ve rather played for the cameras ramsdale
who let him play😂🤣😂
Maguire shouldn't be on a professional pitch any longer
and he still deserve to play for england and captain of MU . . . . .
Harry Von Guire played well today
Maguire, the god of British football. Classic giving away critical possession and penalty, I have been missing it
12 vs 10 for maguire
Tomori deserves maguires spot
Maguire should be sell way way lower  than his previous transfer fee and he should go to less competitive leagues than epl. Who knows it could bring the best of him
Pickford England #1. There should not be a debate.
Pickford England #1. There should not be a debate.
German kits look amazing
Do no Germans watch these videos on German Football channel, or do they just cave in and comment in English?
MAGUAIRE 🤣🤣🤣
This commentator is horrendous, sounds like a parody from a comedy skit.
Maguire the best center back in the LOL
england, hahahahahahahaaa....bye bye :)
You can always count on Harry Maguire to beat England. Consistent, World-class.
King Maguire found the game to be drab and so by decree of his Majesty none of his loyal subjects were to be  bored by sleep inducing footy.
Maguire had a nice game but as usual, his team led him down.
wtf harry maguire
Haaaarry Maguire 🙃😅
1:20 "On his left foot as well"?? Doesn't he know he's left-footed?😂
The Lions got off to a worse start actually, the Sterling saved attempt was the first signs of life, sorry Mr. Announcer, but you suck
Legend Maguire what a performance ☕️
rahem sterling best player in the world
Maguire é a prova de que você que está lendo este comentário é capaz de realizar seus sonhos. Vai na fé. Se esse cara conseguiu se transformar num jogador profissional você também consegue ser quem quer
Maguire is good
Great to see maguire playing well for Germany
King Kai on the way 🙌🏾
Stergen on fire 🔥
the one thing England Football has that Germans can be jealous off? Wembley Stadium!
Credit to Maguire for giving the Germans a chance.
Harry maguire..🤦🤦‍♂️
Maguire Man of the match!
Pickford?
Maguire = southgate,,, LOL,,, stupid
That's what happened when you let maguire defend your goal area, slabhead is such a very dangerous player to his own team..
Miguer Oh Miguer ...
Saka came in and change the game
Ter 👏👏👏
Imagine if VAR didn’t exist and Shaws goals turns into a ghost goal like lampard in 2010
If maguire plays he always has the spotlight
King maguire always gives a big impact
Maguire selalu melawak Ngacho Haha
Maguire 😂😂😂😂
Beautiful match💁
Maguire still hungry for own goal,.
MOTM : HARRY MUJAER
No better result for England 10 men when they play against 12 players.
Rip maguire..
Still not good enough by England
I swear England always gets a penalty every game
Ben White and Ramsdale in the team would guarantee a win.
Maguire does not deserve to be Manchester United captain
Why England look like Holland with orange ??? 🤣
Maguire 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Maguire with yet another stellar performance to add to his best of video..... How he is still in the starting 11 is beyond me
I love how both penalties were  super clear faults, yet the ref had to check VAR to see that they were in fact penalties.
Why are people dissing pope? He's played 10 and lost 2
As a Chelsea fan I'm glad I didn't switch off this match after that dreadful first half   Let's go boiz
Harry Kane put a goal on another than penalty ?
For the longest time, I always thought Marc Andre ter Stegen was Dutch 🤣
매과이어 또 사고쳤네 ㅋㅋ
Maguire
LORD Maguire
Las selecciones más pechofrios enfrentándose jajajajaj
Southgate the utter clown
Maguire the best cb in the world
Wondering if I have the first  name Harry like maguire n Kane would I have the privilege they have
Wow Maguire truly is the definition of a Manchester United captain, what a world class CB everyone should watch this legend in awe while we still can, roll on the world cup!! For sure the first name in southgates squad. with him it's surely coming home  😍
Harry Maguire man of the match
Germany players; "Dont worry, Maguire plays we will get something" 😆😆
The only thing worse tgan tge commentator was the England performance if only they were as good at football as they are at knee bending to third worlders
Maguire, the SPOILER. It's High time now for the new manager.
Maguire classic move  Top legend
Finally Germany have a proper no. 9. Please welcome HARRY MAGUIRE 🤩
벤투나 사우스게이트나 ㅋㅋ
I think this world cup semis will be England, Argentina,brazil, Germany's or Belgium.
Tomori in, Maguire out. When?
Hope that today everybody understood that Pickford is the No1
Bt7trk
Why can't Havertz do that for us at Chelsea? ugh..
Maguire still superior 🫡
Harry Kane is a joke. Atleast he can score via penalty and header, otherwise he’ll be below average player.
Playing into a defenders leg while throwing your other foot up is obvious guile.
Don't why yall hate Maguire so much he is the most consistent player ever. Name one player that always has an assist every game. I will wait.
♥️🤍🔥💪
Who the f is this commentator - so annoying
Again mAguire. Hehe
Harry……..😂😂😂😂
Ben white > lord harry
Superb performance by World Best False Defender.  Other than that, someone celebrate like winning a world cup😂😂😂
Still cant believe man who cant even get in united 11 is in englands 11 ..time for a change here too
What a shame. Korean defender Kim Minjae is much better than Macguire
Maguire🤮🤮🤣
Kang Mujaerrrrrr
Maguire is the best defender of the world
Harry Maguire 🤦
Annoying commentary
Lord maguire wht a defender still in a team
0:47 LOL
12 players vs 10
Ter stergen should be the man of the match
Maguire as always
Close to first half it was 0-0 ..then got fired up. 🤞🙆🏻🔥🔥
Đội trưởng hary mác hài vẫn diễn tốt 😂
1:52 It's a goal. I know it's a goal. But these reflexes from Ter Stegen are unbelievable. I know he didn't save it. But the reaction speed insane.
Hàng hậu vệ và thủ môn tuyển Anh đá như gà mắc thóc.
멍청한 잉글랜드
Maguire he was born to perform comedy..
Maguaire lawak wkwkw
Kai havertz 🔥🔥🥶
As a city fan I have to appreciate the goal of haverts, that was super 👌🏿
Harry Maguire  again 😂
Good to see Maguire extending his altruism to other nations. What a great guy.
Simple, drop Maguire and bring back Pickford.
Shaw caught in no man's land as usual. And McGuire, wow, this guy must make a fortune betting against himself every game. That pass and then the hack at the ankles... Wow 🤯🤯
Maguire 🤣🤣🤣
Inggris liga terbaik di dunia..tapi unyuk timnas jelek banget
I think Maguire needs to be investigated for potentially trying to throw games for bookmakers by this points.
Maguire ????????????????
Maguire the best CB🤣🤣🤣
Хаверц 🔥🔥🔥🤘🏼
0:38 here you go lads, happy Tuesday
I'm Satisfied to see how improve our Team also happy to see The jersey design ... Best never rest 🇩🇪🇧🇩

how can maguaire be played without thinking
Mujaer harus starter di mu
Why is the commentator talking like that? Super weird.
England = Spurs of Europe Bottlers at it again 🤭🤭🤭
"England fans hails England team"  The WORSE team I've ever seen.... JOKERS! 🤣
Maguire is absolutely the worst defender I've ever seen playing professional football, the clips you can play of his mistakes are Ming boggling and I'm a man utd fan 🤣
Maguire stupit
Harry Maguire show no mercy on the field. Time to Maguire going back to learn basic football technic before too late for he sitting long time at the reserve bench.
Kai Havertz 🔥🔥🔥
Mắc hài hêhhehehe😂😂
Vẫn là anh
Maguire ki bosokk..kog yo do iseh percoyo ngono
Pope is dreadful, I'd rather we played 38 year old scott carson
Ter Stegen 👏👏👏👏
McGuire is a genius defender, the way he let that ball nut Meg him on purpose was brilliant.
What an idiot smile from Southgate after the match. How idiot Harry Maguire. When can they fcking know that their capabilities are not suitable for England team and Premier League respectively?
Thank you again Hary Meguire hahahaha
God Save Maguire!!!! sigan poniendo a ese tronco que van a llegar lejos.  por favor qué tablón, tiene menos movilidad que un cono de entrenamiento;  qué pufo de jugador y lo peor de todo es que irá al mundial . Creo será el primer "Sir" condecorado por Charly III 🤣
There are many good players, but coach is not a good one to play them. Fire coach is the first choice
How on Earth is Harry still starting for England ?!!! 🤯🤯🤯
Is it that there’s no replacement for Harry Maguire ?😂
Maguire is such a pure talent, he helps everyone to score
맥과이어는 외국인도 똑같은 방법으로 악플을 다네  ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
All offences intended. Maguire is getting my yearly salary in a week and has consistently convinced me, I should be playing at this level. And I’d do it for half the paycheck
Less agile defender like Maguire will get exposed in the modern game.
The second half was too thrilling after a stalemate in the first. Thanks to Havertz for securing a draw lest Germany lose the match again! Yet sadly, Die Mannschaft just could not beat the Three Lions in the past year. 🤨🤔
I don't understand something... Harry Maguire still playing football. Are coaches blind? Does he pays to play? I mean what's that?
Ter Stegen 🔥
Maguire is a great source of inspiration for youngsters for what not-to-be😂😂😂 and Southgate is dedicated to the cause😂😂😂
On his left foot as well! He is left footed bruh
국대만 오면 달라지는 매과이어
Germany,s player very very happy when they know maguire is the defender
open your eyes southgate, you will go home early in qatar if you play maguire
MVP FOR THE MATCH? OF CORS LORD HARRY MAGUWAYER 🗿
Germany Defense are so bad
Harry maguslayer
Harry Maguire, defender, captain, leader, legend!😂😂
bad performance by england , germany look like contenders for world cup at moment .
Harry Maguire, defender, captain, leader, legend!😂😂
If Maguire is not the waterboy for United next week I'll just smile endlessly
Kane still don’t have a field goal!
We have a new goalie where is neuer
Harry harry
Harry Maguire does it again
Commentator sounds like hes on its a knockout 😂
헤리케인 패널티킥 하난 세계최고

Harry Maguire is toping the headlines once again A true LEGEND
Matakna ulah sok pelangi2 an
What make pope no.1 suddenly? Dont tell me its because of twitter joke last time.
England🤦‍♂
WORLD CLASS OVER-HYPED MAGUIRE..NO WONDER YOU ARE  NOW A BENCH WARMER
Glory glory Harry maguire
I said 3 weeks ago Southgate will get sacked poor manager England need a foreign manager
Pope out ramsdale in
Nick Pope is not ready for big stage. Just stick with angry Everton man.
Im an England fan but that was a niiiiiiuce f@ckin goal by Havertz!
all these harry maguire comments bruhhhh im crying
អាឃ្លោលនៅតែអាឃ្លោក😂
Harry Maguire 🤣🤣🤣🤣 cười ẻ
The worst possible outcome. We needed a bad beating to help Southgate get sacked.
Lord Maguire in action
Bot
If Maguire made it, you can make it too! Never lose hope!
why does he keep playing Englands number 3 keeper
Meguaire ada aj tingkah gobloookknya kalo maen 🤣🤣🤣
Keep playing, Maguire.. the GOAT
In Germany's first goal, he lost it at the start, Musiala made him a little straw and ended up committing a penalty.  In the second goal of Germany, everything was born after his loss for exaggerating with the driving in the rival field.  Harry Maguire and another night of failures.  MISTAKE AFTER MISTAKE.
Maguire LORD👺👽👾
If Mcguire can make it to the national team, my dog can.
What a game, as a Germany fan I think both teams played some entertaining football. Both teams scored a sweaty goal, Penalty and a world class goal. Hyped for Qatar
Seriously, if Maguire is going to be a starter at the world cup, the three lions will be a joke when defending.
Đúng mắc hàie😂😂
Luke Shaw Safe Manchester United's dignity
Đến chịu Maguire. Anh nên ở nhà
everything of lord maguire. good player
For fk sake... Maguire really? U have so many cb at england
Let both these huge football forces have their pathetic 3 all draw. They are both at the bottom and dropped out. Nothing to see here but boring clueless football from both sides.
Maguire is England’s biggest tragedy this month.
1:45 Nice goal.
ยอดเยี่ยมครับ
Maguire is Phil Jones 2.0
Southgate's downfall will be his insistence on using a bench player like Maguire. He is at best an EFL Championship player. Slow af & error-prone!
Saka impact
Hahahah miguayerrrrrr
Maguire cing
Pues Ter Stegen está haciendo méritos para ser titular en el mundial, aunque parece que Flick prefiere a Neuer. Gracias a Ter Stegen Inglaterra no metió 5 o 6 goles
Let Maguire breath.. Too much trolling on the poor lad.
Megueyer trash
Maguire 🤣🤣🤣
For our greatnesses and mercy In this world cup Maguire must be on the bench
Why does the commentator add the letter 'a' before every word?
Africa vs africa
Clumsily giving away a penalty is bad. But Maguire actually provided an assist to the German player in order to give the penalty away! Masterful play!
Why the tournament is playing?
Only Premier league players scored
both teams look good and are legitimate threats to go far in the world cup!
3 lions hhhhh more like the 3 chickens.
Maguire United 💫✨
World class
Harry Maguire
Maguire really justifying his inclusion ahead of Tomori! It’s great to see
Ter Statue comes back again with his usual "masterclass"
McGuire is not from this world, best player ever
3-3 it is a fair result.
매과이어 다이어 똥쟁이들을 이렇게 모아놓으니 가관이구만
Lord maguire 🤡🤡 pantes aja di cadangin ....super lawak mainnya..
Same old maguire, and he played for 90', shame on southgate
6 goals in 16 minutes
why doesn't havertz do this in chelsea? hilarious
I can’t believe that maguire is still in the squad.
Just the coincidence that Barcelona trolled chelsea all summer but then it was a chelsea player smashing one in against a barca goalkeeper😅
Lord M 😍
Mujaer ballon D'or lol
Couldn't listen to the commentator's voice on this video. Switched off. That's as bad as they come. Like nails down a chalkboard.
England should be the pioneers of the 1st player transfer in the history of world football...by selling Maguire on free...
The one and only HARRY MAGUIRE 😂😂
What are player maquire best defender legend
Ben white is better than Harry maguire
Jesus christ, how irritating is the INtoNAtion of the COMentaTOR? Had to mute after twenTY SECONDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [sic]
Maguire to Southgate: "you need goals?-start me" The coach never understood what he meant 😂
Fool maguire
Saka the best
The England coach is clueless, he can push walker into Maguire position and play Arnold at walkers position simply
Maguire has to be knighted!
Maguire=Mr Bean on football🤣🤣
Maguire at his best. Nice penalty assist
Indonesia
Maguire hahah
Still the same. Maguire play = lose / draw.😢
Big Harry did not disappoint yet again!
Seeing this in person was so different to how it's Seen on highlights
Maguire adalah koentji 🤸
Not sure why England plays with 3 at the back and with 2 wingbacks, waste of their full backs and attacking options.   Southgate loves Maguire Sooo9ooooo much to accomodate him 😂
Partidazo
Maguire is the best 💆‍♂️
Why Haverts never do that at Chelsea ? Scoring from the distance
If southgate actually starts maguire in the World Cup, it’s safe to say that he deserves a sacking, tomori is the ideal replacement
Mujaeeerrr
Maguire. The true baller.
Macquire have the problem
Menegang kan
Maguwaya with another legendary performance that shall be remembered for the rest of football history
I don't know where all this hate for Harry comes from he nearly got it ....
Harry maguire strikes yet again
Harry Maguire. The ultimate 'false five'.
Poor Games for both sides.
Ref was one of the best footballer in English team.
Mcguire is England's most consistent player
finally got a point!!! Congratulations England for the single point in the nations league
I thought it could be Ramsdale vs Leno..
첼시 2명이 지리네 ㅋㅋ
How Mount and Havertz can finish like that when at club level they've both been missing far easier chances blows my mind
Skills moves are sometimes named after the player who made it famous…like a Cruyff turn.    Coughing up the ball + giving away a penalty heretofore will be a Maguire ….
Don't know which team is in worse shape going into the WC?  England were pocketed the last few games they played: boring, predictable, slow.  That's until this German defense were put before them.  squandering a 2:0 lead in 11 minutes? Astounding.  Something england would do 😉 That German backline was at sea. Midfield and movement still solid; but Werner's struggles in front of goal....Germany's answer to Emil Heskey 😉  but wait...if you think Germany are bad....Harry Maguire is awful.  The gift that keeps giving.  Don't expect much from these two.
I dont know if its southgate the problem cause england have incredible players but it miss something to be on top.. Anyway maguire must end his career for real if he go to qatar its over for england
I knew Shaw would shine!!!...... Glad to see Harry playing so incredibly amazing for Flick!!
hahaa maguire beban negara
Saka change the whole game
Two poor teams who wont be troubling the eventual winners of the world cup.
Maguwayer Hahahahhahaha
Maguire……. Absolute rubbish
I'd rather Phil Neville than Harry McSlab Head
Nice kids mount and kai
Andai maguire main di liverpool, pasti dia tidak akan memiliki tempat di skuad inggris, dan pastinya dapat cemo,ohan oleh supporter inggris.
กอดคอกันหล่นไปเล่น ในลีกB😆😆😆😆
Jarri maguaie
well that y harry Maguire 🤔 won't ever see man united back line
Kehancuran bagi maguer
Harry Maguire at his best again some things never change What do these manager's see in him beats me
Highlights commentator reacting like its like and puts 'a' at the end of half his words. Wtf. Who is Sterlinga?
Havertz & Mount 💙💙💙
Thanks Harry Maguire , you inspire every non athletic lads out there in the world...if this guy can play for England so ca we all.
Germany is just not convincing anymore 😢 France is really about to be back to back world champs
no ramsdale?
I feel that Maguire threatens Southgate with something to keep his position in England team
Why are people ripping up Maguire? He was the best player for Germany 😁
Maguaire again
Nobody is speaking about Daka bringing England back into the game.
GG Harry Maguire🤣✊🏻
England teams love u sir maquire!! 👏👏
everyone knows Maguire is bad so why do coaches still let him play?????
Plk german goal Keeper very god
England shouldn't count on winning any games as long as Maguire starts/plays
Man Harry maguire is hella trash 😂
maguire messi ronaldo G.O.A.T......
Kai Havertz is back!
England Bapuk 🤣
Worst commentary ever.
World class game. Didn't disappoint.
Rubbish Maguire! Always be hero for the team of opponents! Well done to himself & the coach!
Harry Maguire 😵‍💫
Eric ten Hag don’t give SH*t bout Maguire
Chelsea's domination...
Maguire bek macam tai kok di pakai terus haduh.....🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Harry maguire reminds me of Space Jam..  Somewhere in looney toon land some weird looking alien has a massive forehead and can actually pass a ball..
i feel like Rashford would be key in these matches his pace and finishing on the break is unmatched ..
Hary maguaire world Classs Defenderss
Saka, Sterling, and Maguire….Idk wtf Southgate sees in these three fools. They’d get 0 mins from me if i was the coach  How Maguire is getting playtime over Tomori is completely beyond me
Maguire is hero for Germany
HARRY MAGUIRE THE GOAT 💀
That series from Maguire is absolute rubbish, how do you compound on mental errors in back to back sequence. He either gets flustered after mistakes or he's trying to "hero-ball" his way out of his mistakes, thinking that he can make up and save face from a blunder by coming up with a superb play, but sorry mate, you might just not have what it takes to pull out incredible plays on the regular basis to have that type of playstyle.
the best of england !  except,... H.maguire 🤣
We saw typical Harry Maguire today. He better not start at the WC. It better be Tomori
This is still rubbish Gareth Southgate is hugging the manager like he won the World Cup
Saka is easily England's best player
I just wanna dig into people's mind who still thinks that Maguire is still capable to play football and put him into the starting XI. I mean, he's slow, can't defend his line, and sloppy...
Jokes Maguire again😂😂😂
WTF MUAJE
OF COURSE it was Harry Maguire who gave away the penalty.....
Saka oh my gosh
Chelsea goal club' harvetsz 2 goal germany and m.mount 1 goal
Vẫn là maguire😂
Maguire did it again!
Dug la thu mon duc choi wa te tertagen ko du trinh bat cho tuyen duc
Maguire and Pope are too much of a burden to this team
It's the Chelsea show .......kaixmount
빵글랜드 ㅋㅋㅋ
Maguire was the best player for Germany 😆
Havertz is pretty good but Maguire is a true Berliner 🇩🇪
Goal fest, England just found their shooting shoes
Maguire makes me understand on why football is such an entertaining sports.
Neuer menepis dua tendangan  99% yg berpotensi jadi gol 👍
Harry Maguire 😂😂😂😂 in the replay you can see his face reaction after makes a tackle in the penalty box. This guy is joke.
แฮรี่แม็กกวย
Is Southgate trying to get sacked? Picking Maguire again?  Picking Pope over Ramsdale again? Dier is the side? Foden starting at RW over Saka? His team selection is awful, time and time again.
Bateu roupa o goleiro da inglaterra
메과이어 멀티골😂
Maguire lawak 🤣
“On his left foot as well” ???? He’s left footed smh
world class fridge....ice cold
yep its super maguire
Maguire has had his time at the top if he actually ever got to the top. As a retired center back sometimes you make silly mistakes but when you start making them mistakes week in week out its time to say OK I'm done and leave the game behind as hard as it is but its for the best.
I’m seriously thinking that Maguire made a promise with the devil… What has he done to play as captain of Man United and England?
Tired of seeing Maguire making the same mistakes and blaming his team mates would rather see mings or Coady.
England no.5 is best player
Maguire 🤣🤣🤣
Lord marguire
Please don't fire Harry Maguire and Gary Sawgate because we Iranians need these two for the World Cup.😅✌️
Aree Magwaya!!!
What competition it? 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
Harry Maguire 😅😅😅😅
How is that a pen for England?
Harry Maguire!! Never disappoints
What is wrong with the comentar Voice
Jerman kalau mainya tetep begini sulit untuk menjuarai pilala dunia qatar ... Kenepa main kamu kok semakin jelek jerman ... Tingkatkan dong ,jgn main jelek, juarai piala dunia qatar q mendukungmu ...
Captain Maguaire 🔥
only saw 4 goals
Maguire and Southgate should ve been kicked out years ago. What do you expect from clueless English FA Officials who has won nothing in their history other than home soil advantage WC1966
What is wrong with maguire and why he still be playing for nat team idk
Maguire joker play.. Looking football not making player
I'll be Ready For the World cup 💪
Maguire not exactly making his case here.
Harry Maguire is ridiculous
MVP is Harryyyyy .........
Maguire, what a defender, every strikers dream to play against
Heyii Megueyer 😂😂😂
Magurie idiot
Jesus Maguire strikes again with a stupid lazy pass
This premier league game??
Why Harvertz never score for chelsea
Lord maguire 🤣🤣👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Harry maguireeeeee 🤣🤣🤣🫣
Maguaire besf performance this match 👌
I don't think I've ever seen someone maligned as much as Harry Maguire in football. I'm not saying it's not deserved.
Maguire assist germany 🤣
Don’t give up Harry you can beat it
Omg....Maguire again?!?!?!?!?
kai and mount... 👍👍👍
first flight back get your tickets booked
I’ve never heard a more annoying commentator hahah
It was a thrilling match 💙
Maguire has taken people's attention away from Southgate 😊
rooting for maguire as always won't disappoint gave us 2 assist.....great lad should buy him....
Maguaire😂😂😂
Harry Maguire literally Fox in the box
Maguire oh naguire
I dont blame Maguire, the problem here is the fact Nick pope and the defenders  speak english spanish.
Nice to see the Fridge bringing the match to life
i love maguaire...  world class wkwk
Finally,  Musiala started from the beginning..proved the team , he's so talented. And Ter Stegen did well  despite giving up 3 goals .  Where's Reus?
How many times are we gonna see this from maguire and still think its OK to play him. The patience has long gone. He should not be in this squad as of last year let alone STILL starting!!!!
HARRY MAGUIRE👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Maguire is a mule of a footballer. Has hooves for feet.
Maguire bribe Southgate so he can be call up in the england squad. Good money making Mr Southgate
Kai Havert Call , Mout Answer
This commentator is making my teeth itch !
It’s serious that they prefer Saka because of Sancho, we’re crazy 🤯
Maguire never disappointed, always delivers🤣🤣🤣
Maguire is the toughest opponent I’ve ever faced - nick pope
master of maguire
Between Maguire and Pope. The other teams dont stand a chance.
hary maguire..... hahahahaaaaaaa
Player rating Ter Stegen 7.8 KAI harvert 8.9 Meguire 9.8
This a-commentator is a-so annoying , I can’t concentrate on the a video at all completely ruined it for a-me 😅
I thank you Maguire.... ticket saved 🤣
The goalkeeper and Maguire..... What a duo!
Friendship et Freundschaft. Hugging et smiling Southgate et Flick.. Final score, London 4, Manchester 2.
The farmers league nation got relegated, doesn’t it better than that
Saka!!! Game changer
German defense lineup's very poor. May be 10 minutes around they has been received 3 goals 🤬
england have the players to attack, he needs to attack
KING KAI
The football Gods are punishing coaches that picks maguire
This is a decent team when the ditch Southgateball like they did after Germany’s second goal....
Pemain titipan pemda meguwayer berulah lagi wkwkwkw .. bek lawak cok
Germany motm: Harry Maguire
Maguire!!! How many time i call you???🤔🤔🤔
All the toxic fans blaming maguire just for the penalty. U dont look Nick Pope?
Sometimes I just don't get it...the term favouritism is so obvious...always the same line-up...Toney deserves to play...Abraham deserves to play as both is doing well at their clubs...but still the same 3 upfront...defensively...stop stop stop playing Maguire please...really...not worth the call-up no matter what Gareth belief is...he will be the final nail to Gareth's coffin...
Ter Stengen is world class ❤️
Could be the worst commentary I’ve ever heard
After this match tthe ones who's on Maguire side saying there's too much negativity against him... Better put that Maguire glasses off.  He caused the first 2 goals, penalty and losing the ball don't even get why he didn't put pressure on Havertz because there were enough men behind him.  At the moment I'm just glad that ManU is performing way better without him. It wouldn't suprise me if they get knocked out already in the group stage at the World Cup.  Also a por performance from Germany seeing a lead of 2 goals vanished away within 10 minutes and scoring the German way (last 5 min) the equaliser.
Maguire and pope are problematic and should not be there
I'm upset because we keep on giving away easy goals we need to firm up that defense regardless of it being a B team.
Pope messed up
Maguire
Anyone else think the penalty against Germany was a bit harsh, it was a 50-50, both has studs up, he just came off worse.
That’s what I like about Maguire. The older I get, the more he stays the same. Alright alright alright
Keep strong Germany 💪
Maguire is a nightmare
Good performance from Luke Shaw today, that cross to Sterling in the first half was great. You can't ask for a better pass than that.
Maguaire
Worst commentary
Croatia in final4 England la pa pa 😚👋👋
Kai king
Fantastic performance by maguire👍👍👍👍👍👍
Well Julie have more players than us  they had  Maguire on their side as well
Saka coming off the bench, solos the midfield, assists 🐐
Stop envying mount,the lad is a baller. The guy has Lampard trait in him but being misused by managers. He is a box to box player.
Maguire 🤣🤣
I don't know why Maguire is not knighted yet.
I can't believe Maguire is a professional player, let alone play for england 🤣🤣
Harry Maguire is the best Germany's Player
Also have to add that Musiala is an amazing star, he's absolutely brilliant
maguire is superstar joke's
MAGUIRE POWER
So happy for the Chelsea boys, Havertz, Mount and Reece all contributed with 4 G/A's between them. 💙💙
Maguire. The permanent 'Champions League Final Loris Karius'.
Bad result for England... a defeat would have been better... the comeback papers over the cracks... a defeat and Southgate would have been forced to drop Maguire after his hand in both German goals. But now, he will likely start the opener!  Shocking that Tomori, one of the best CB in Serie A last season gets snubbed for this lump
Tim anti menang 🤣
Dimana Rudiger?
Maguire with 2 assists today what a player!
Maguire is backed up by the British Crown : that is the only explanation about why he has been selected.
Premier League qualities! Scored from 4  different club..
Maguire lord of prank? LOL..
Harry Maguuire should just give the game a break ND come back cause wat all this??
Meguaiyerr lagi 😂😂
Pope c'est pas du tout top.
Maguire going to win the World cup!
fantastic player.. MOTM maguire
England have a robot goalkeeper? Hahah funny
Maguire is like kamala Haris   & J. BIden nobody notes nothing.
Great display from Lord Maguire as always. He plays using his hands more than feet lol
Kai looks weird with short hair. Not a fan. But whatever. Come on you Bluuuues
sai fora mentirosos
It’s coming home
Maguire, the gift that keeps on giving 😆😆
Saka so garbage
Toss up between Pope & Maguire for MOTM imo
Maguire, man of the match in Germany.
Maguire is just a waste of space
Maguire is just a defending master
Hahahah Harry should not play ! Should not be in the starting 11 or on the bench . He gave them bad luck as usual even to Man united 😂🤣🤡
Lord Maguaire comedy😁
how does maguire still get called up to play for nationals....blows my mind.
Football without Maguire is nothing
Lord Maguire 🤣
Lord Maguire 🥲
Just remember, if you're going to criticize a guy for straight passing the ball to the other team and then give that guy a penalty on top of it, you're "just doing it for the clicks."
The funniest 2nd half I've ever seen 😂
Harry kane penalty shot my god rocket 🚀
The German national football team should be disgusted with themselves as they did not beat this terrible English side. Even Harry Maguire tried to gift you the win but you did not take it. Greetings from England.
The Manchester united players Southgate picked have ruined him...bring in Rashford and Sancho to clear our name
Maguire half broke his duck. A game that he started and did not lose this season! Next is to get a victory.
First goal and second goal mistake from maguire lol !!
Absloute garbage.. how did we lose this after being 2-0 up
Harry Maguire is a truly world class player for Germany. Be very happy that he played well for his county Germany. Don't give up Harry.
Werner havert connection 💙, Mason kido 💙
I've seen milk turn quicker than Harry Maguire.
Sterling is a mistake. Harry the captain 😆
Backing should be stones, tamori, walker
McGuire and Dier are bang average players. Maddison should be in there on current form
And someone said: "Many Football Fans are toxic when they trolled Harry Maguire". But he is really deserves with that
Just get Maguire out! Simple.
Takes Southgate going down 2-0 to actually start playing football
We need more Maguires in football. Pure entertainment.
Why/How is Magwaya still paid money to play professional football?
England has poor goal keeper as always
What is wrong with this man's voice?  He's constricting his larynx at the end of every sentence. What a fraud.
Is it just me or do Andre Ter Stegen, Manuel Neuer, and Bernd Leno all have a resemblance???🤔🤔🤔
Loving to see ter stegen performing very well with Germany in absence of nueur
Por que não escala Ramsdale? Por que continua insistindo com Maguire?
Maguire so funny 😂
Top performance, as usual, Lord Maguire!!!
Come on England
Nick Pope is one of the best players that England has to offer 🤭😂
Ter Stegen wow
Pope
England vs Germany And Maguire
May England win the 2022 world cup in Qatar 🇬🇬❤️😃👍
funny thing is that kane only make goals on penalties maybe england should consider another striker, in my opinion kane has lost his edge abit but can aswell find it again, still though good match and as tyler b says musiala and bellingham 2 good ballers who are commin up in the world.
Mount, James , Havertz ❤‍🔥
If maguire starts at the wc Southgate is a coward
1st goal: Maguire fault horrendous 2nd goal: Maguire could've pushed up being that there were two defenders already in the same space he could've pressured the ball. Hrs absolute trash his face is stupid too
Honestly I see only one German player with determination and desire to make them go far. That's Havertz. Imagine how Bayern must feel now that they blew it on signing him. Now they are desperate to find anyone close to Lewy. Good luck.
Man of the match is harry Maguire
Question for the England fans just answer with yes or no. Is England ready for the worldcup? and is southgate the right man to take England forward?
แฮรี่ แม๊คไกว์ติด แค่เบนไวท์ไม่ติด ระบบลูกรักจริงๆ
Jesus is comming soon repent from your sins God loves you all ✝️❤️
Player of the game Harry Maguire 👏 🙌
German+Maguire VS England 👀
Pertandingan yg sangat menarik dgn gengsi ke dua negara 🔥😊
Maguire  played well for Germany
Harry maguire goat
Lisandro Martinez bench him, but Southgate start him, if you know...you know...
Look how our lord still playing 🤡 nice jokes
Harry magyer 😅
The Bavarian lads did it well. Sané was playing good defensively. I recognize Stegen as well (the goals were on point for england but ter showed world class saves).
I think with a coach like tuchel England can dream of a world cup and dont line up maguire anymore.
how does the commentator not know havertz is left-footed
EPL sensation 👏
Lord Maguire never change 🤣
Harry My man 🐐
Omg was that Tomori wearing a Maguire jersey he looked world class today
Can imagine why Southgate include Msguire in the team. His antique in penalty has given penalty kick to opposing team on many occasions
Harry Maguire, handing out penalties like Halloween candy again.
1:04 "Pope with absolutely a-no chance and Germany -- with a one a-nothing a-lead."
Germany win world cup  final 2022 👍👍👍
All the German Bayern players have had 2 wins in their last 7 professional games 💀
Maguire 😭
Southgate's decision making will be the downfall of this team, this isn't 2018
Got to say luke shaw played pretty well today.  Bellingham unreal, maguire maguire,
A very good second half although the first half was boring, Germany should have won thou cause they were the better team
Sterling, wkwkwk
Master class from Ser Maguire  🔥
Why is the German broadcast different?
Not a fan of either side but Musiala RAN into Maguire, with every intention of drawing the foul. Of course this is common but at the last second he actually ran into Maguire. That was weak, kind of transparent. Why VAR can’t see that?
McGuire!!! 😆
For about 5 min near the end, the English fans thought it was coming home again.
Harry Maguire🤣
Maguire.  What can be said about  him that  hasn't  already been  said  good  for world Cup  as England  should be  home early 😀
Hari marquie 😁
Forget about 'world class save', Sterling has problems with finishing take it or leave it.
Pope is actually so bad
Ter stegen 🔥
Maguire and pope need to be out
The unreal game
better from VAR this time
Harry MaGuire giving the ball away for the first goal and then losing possession for the second 😂 a true leader - deserved that call up 😂to show all the England fans how bad he actually is for Man Utd
Lawak bek harry Maguire
No other players but Maguire .... Born to be a Joker.
He's Harry Maguire. :)
Overdubbed commentary should be banned. Painful.
Hahaha maguire
The problem here is Southgate, he is useless
Glad for the Chelsea lads...As a neutral fan it was a good match..Maguire is proof that some things never change
Southgate out..wheres tomori sancho rashford..madison? Kyle walker should be cb..
On BBC's fans player rating Maguire got a cool 2.58/10. The worst player in the whole match. How can I player who is so consistently dreadful not have been demoted to the reserves or the bench.
Maguire is so awful man literally rubbish
I'm always happy when I see England fans think they're going to win, then win nothing.. 👋👋
Maguire is the 🐐
Havertz goal was a joy to watch. And I’m English.
Never change maguire, never change 😁
Inglaterra debería poner este 11                       Ramsdale        Walker     Stones      Kilman  James     Bellingham Rice     Chilwell              Phoden        Mount                           Kane
Ramsdale white need to start
So Trent can’t get in the team because he’s not good enough defensively. Yet Maguire starts??
Весь состав Англии наверное проклинает тренера за Магуира ещё и в старте
Great commentary
Sir Maguire. GOAT
havertz to munich ❤️❤️❤️
Just put Havertz as the main striker please.
Fixed match!  Thank you for waking me up!  i will never gamble or watch football ever again!
Harry maguire 💪😎
Maguire !!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Southgate estás ciego !!! Llévate a Max Kilman, Tarkowski o Tomori y deja a Maguire en Inglaterra descansando...
Maguire being Maguire 😅
I love that Bellingham penalty. He wouldn’t have ever touched the ball if schlotterbeck didn’t poke it first. I guess you inevitably will get a PK at home when you go to the ground all game
Southgate needs to go
Proper brexit tackle from Harry Maguire
Good to see maguire playing world class like always 😳😩  Thanks for the likes people never had this many lol 👍🏻
Mason Mount what a finish !!
what a comback from england🙈
Germany for ever 🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪
This dudes commentary is painful
Maguire haciendo un maguire
as a neutral this was an amazing match to watch
Maguire why? 😁
Not gegen Elend. Werden beide in Qatar nix reißen!
mesut ozil
Very Bad German coach, bring back low to coach. That's not how football is played by low views
Come on Germans 🇩🇪💪🏻💀🔥💖
England fan here. Exciting game as per usual with Germany! Some great goals. I think your best player was Harry Maguire 😉
The Chelsea boys stepping up 💯
Harry maguire, the clown strikes again!!!
🖤❤💛
Puts saka in his actual position and he changes the game  Imagine my shock
We need to do better
Disappointing
❤️❤️❤️🇧🇷❤️❤️❤️
