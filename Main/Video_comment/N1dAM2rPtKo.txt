Since mid-2024, Japan's economy has generally performed solidly, with exports surging thanks to a weak yen, strong demand for semiconductors and frontloading ahead of U.S. tariffs. However, turning to Q3, the economy began to creak under the weight of elevated inflation plus higher interest rates and U.S. tariffs.
No one can compete Japan economy
It made a lot of noise in my head when you praised inflation. Then when you also praised and quoted Paul Krugman, a long known snake oil salesman, I stopped watching and disliked this video.
1989 Japan❤
The conservative culture in Japan created the best engineering projects they don’t compite with the world because they got their own standards and we’ve seeing that here in the states with Toyota, Honda, Sony they lead in reliability
No, they can't.
good video
Most of Japan's issues stem from it being a fairly conservatively minded country. Overly conservative thinking is stagnating to any meaningful growth.
there's no doubt that japanese tech is still high quality, but the thing is japan's population has been decreasing.
Just let japan like it supposed to be, Japan has accept the sweet they should be accept bitteness too... It's nature thing not human to responsible to
Japan isn’t interested in fixing its economy, while it should
The U.S. did Japan dirty
This guy repeats the usual outsider script: Japan is 'insular,' salaries are low, houses aren’t luxurious, and it resists mass immigration. But here’s the truth: that’s not dysfunction — that’s design. Japan prioritized social stability over global capital flows. It refused to flood its cities with foreign cash, inflate housing, or import a migrant underclass to keep wages down. Yes, productivity isn’t stellar by Western metrics — but neither is inequality, crime, or debt dependency. What Western economists call 'stagnation' is often just Japan saying 'no' to unsustainable growth models.  As for language and insularity — why is it always a problem when a nation preserves its own culture? Japan didn’t colonize the world and doesn’t need to prove its openness to anyone. It doesn’t owe Silicon Valley or Paul Krugman a seat at the table."  And the punchline? These critics admit Japan still has a high quality of life — even after rejecting everything they prescribe. Maybe that’s not failure. Maybe it’s quiet success.
TOKTO and genrally Japan has cheap housing and food which is great and metro system is just awesome
うちの国ってなんでスケープゴートに使われるんだろ。海外の記事で自殺率やら職場環境やら、なんでわざわざ30年前のデータ持ってくるのか意味不明。

Japan went from being bomed out in 1945 to the envy of the world 30 to 40 years later. I've no doubt Japan can recover from its current problems. It's North America and Europe that needs to be worried for their future
💖❤️💖
importing more people is not the answer, unless you don't mind radically change the country and its culture.
America is the best
Being someone who’s studying geopolitics, Japan (despite its many social and economic issues) has always felt like a breath of fresh air compared to countries like America, China, Russia, South Korea, India or even the European Union.  Their goals - or at least their goals after World War II (💀) - don’t include dominating the globe economically and/or militarily. Far from it. It seems that all they want these days is to be a _strong enough_ country. They don’t meddle in foreign affairs, they don’t spend much on their military, and (based on the real Japanese I’ve spoken to) they don’t care about being “number one” anymore. They’re fairly content with their lot and I think that’s something a lot of other great powers could learn from.   My hope is that in the coming decades they turn their focus inward (not in isolationist way) by fixing their own work culture, birth rates, discrimination issues, etc. Maybe even start gaining some military and ideological independence from America while they’re at it.  Sorry for any English/grammar errors.
日本に定住してくれ、少子高齢化が少し遅れるだけでいいんだw
It's so amazing, a lot of new things
HAD A REPUTATION.
that is not true on soooo many levels
“Japan has been in a prolonged recession simply because the Ministry of Finance, for the sake of its vested interests, repeatedly implemented unnecessary tax hikes. The repeated tax increases during a period of deflationary gap and prolonged recession are the main cause.”
Some economists have projected that both the U.S. and parts of Europe could slip into a recession for a portion of 2024. A global recession, defined as a contraction in annual global per capita income, is more rare because China and emerging markets often grow faster than more developed economies. Essentially the world economy is considered to be in recession if economic growth falls behind population growth.
It's pretty easy to understand .. wages have been frozen for 30 years, so there is no excess money to boost up the economy. Also, most company profits are just put into the bank .. not put into the country to spur growth. The "salary man" in Japan already work long hours (10-12 hours per day, 6 days a week) .. but there is no focus on efficiency. The only measure is "hours in the office" .. not productivity. Even the "soft industries" still have a factory mentality.
No mention of the culture struggle problems when importing migrants by the boatload, often literally? Man, didn't this video age like cheese looking at Europe 💀
They are a good creative & skilled people, But  I feel sorry for them, because they have yet to adapt.
Engineers seem to be the complimentary good for housing. Housing prices in regions with a concentration of engineering jobs is extremely high all around the world. Financial jobs pay ar at least double what engineers earn, but house owners see engineers as walking wallets.
you really think inviting foreign aliens is a good thing
Just adding the market cap of US companies and comparing it to the sum of a few Japanese companies is not very helpful in this day and age. US stocks are pumped to oblivion and past at the moment, while Japanese stocks are a little closer to a realistic valuation. Look at Tesla for example, as the most extreme case. Its selling at 400+ USD, which is missing reality by a universe and a half. If you estimate it's value as a decent EV maker using EV market CAGR predictions as a guideline for growth, the stock should be around 60-100 usd. So comparing market caps by juxtaposing realistic values and pumped fever dreams next to eachother may not be 100% comparable.
US economy has screwed up global economy cuz it will never repay their debts while they spends like drunken sailors. BRICS will help Russia and China  survive Greatest Depression while all Western democracies will become third world countries. Africa seems poised to rise after reclaiming their resources from Euro scoundrels
Quite a dicey situation, isn't it? Economically speaking, of course.
The hypocrisy of the US and other developed countries complaining about manufacturing jobs being stolen by China, yet they don’t see that stealing highly skilled workers from poorer countries are even worse, prolonging those poor countries to forever being poor
Low/no growth but still high quality of life seems better for the average person I feel. I only would care about how good my everyday life is. Poor in a country like Japan would be better than lower middle class in USA.
Krugman , really.
Increasing worker product is counterproductive if it leads to an increase in non-workers.  When the number of non-workers increase government has an issue to resolve.  Their solution is often to create more jobs by increasing paperwork, creating jobs that essentially do nothing, putting more people on the dole,  and other things designed to keep unrest among the people lower.   This causes the increase in the size of business, government, and other organizations with positions that are considered productive even though they are only doing make work.
18:51 dude, Japan is part of the so called “West”
this guy just skipped the elephant in the room. The room is Indo-pacific. The elephant is India. Trump phone called Modi. Modi was the 3rd person Trump called as he got elected.
日本人は移民を必要としていない。むしろ害をもたらす存在として危険視しかしていない
I live in Japan and can report that the quality of life is better here.  The author of this video never got the memo that we have reached limits to growth and need a different yardstick to evaluate life.  On the other hand I welcome this ridiculous negative PR because we dont want a massive influx of people into Japan to ruin quality of life here.
Hey, look at the people's mind set especially young generation. They are falling.. without any ambitions who will be speaking out for the next generation to come. And do not forget that they are having no solution other than to play with rate. Many economists say big  problem almost no hope to overcome.
日本の一人あたりGDPが低いのは、世界一寿命が長い上に少子高齢化、その上に人口が多いため働いていない老人が多いから これは”平均”の問題点だけど
this channel is rubbish
If Japan rises, the United States will feel threatened, so Japan will have no choice but to curb its growth.
No Japan can NOT be saved. Hyper capitalist societies are falling actively as we speak and Japan is one of them. Capitalism is NOT sustainable for humanity as a species and only serves one purpose as a system which is to make unacceptable behavior to you and your fellow man acceptable. Stand up and fight this horrible system if u want our species to have a future!

Why don't they just occupy the rest of the region and exploit their labor? Their neighbors have loads of people.
財務省の役人が自身の出世のために国の利益を犠牲にしているので経済的成功を得ることはありません
Japan Update: They fixed it by finding a pot of gold.
!!! The innate problem with Japan is this. It is a capitalist country with capitalism imposed on a people who are culturally collective !!!!
If you look at this year it is not good. Cost of food have risen 60%, the currency devaluation wiped out savings. And younger people started looking illegal part time jobs, robbing and killing people in a strings of organised crime around Kanto region. The government is still clueless, refuse to increase minimum wage instead fought hard to increase military budget.
"If japan doubled its labor force and then doubled how many hours everyone was working in a year, it should theoretically quadruple its economic output. But what is more likely to happen is that overworked people fighting for fewer jobs end up producing something like $10 worth of value an hour, so only a very marginal improvement in total output is achieved, with a policy that will probably have huge social costs."  - Economics Explained January-3-2024 That's gonna end up in the 2084 econ textbook, you wait and see.
And fell again.
its not that protesting  is not in the Japanese culture. Go look up the protests of the 50s, 60s, and 70s. Japanese people did protest in the past. In large numbers and for good reasons. Often against shady government practices. They don't do it anymore because the generation that grew up after that has been taught and conditioned through the very conformist education system to be passive and non-political. The Japanese education system is very anti-intellectual and non political. If anything it's rather propagandist. It's one of the reasons that they basically never protest or do much of anything against the current LDP government despite their numerous corruption scandals, incompetence, and now having overseen three decades and counting of stagnation. In most other countries this government would have seen mass public action of some type against it.
speak slowly bro,, seems like you gonna miss the train..😅
😢
There are a few mistakes. I will correct the big mistake.  First of all, it is said that the media cannot be distributed freely due to government censorship, but Japan is a freer country than the United States, so there is no censorship. On the contrary, the government's position is very weak, and the media always continues to take it negatively. To be honest, there is even a possibility that the economy has not improved because the media is distributing everything negatively.  And about immigration, basically, if you keep your manners, the Japanese don't care about anything
日本は世界で唯一成功した社会主義国です
総理や政治家はほとんど使い物にならないし平成よりもハッキリ喋らない人が多くなっているから多方面から舐められてます、日本はもうそろほぼ中国の領土と化するかクーデターが起きてもおかしくないのです😶

If you want to experience the stereotypes of Japan, living in Korea is a great option. There you can get a smaller average housing area than in Japan, a higher suicide rate, a more rapidly aging population, and a higher poverty rate.
Yes, if they would open their border to immigration.
What's the music that kicks in as the video starts talking about Japanese Housing, it's freaking beautiful.
Not fixed😂
Japan has to pay 100 billion dollars yearly for security guarantees to the US.
"Quality of life is not as high". I have lived in the US and currently live in Japan. I disagree with this statement, unless your definition of "quality of life" is "having a ton of money".
Inheritance tax never made sense to me, it's insane
Hello!! I want to share my experience and maybe you could elaborate a little bit more on what has been recently happening with Japan's economy and how the value of the Yen has been dropping recently... (I am subscribed to you channel and I know you have been talking a lot of Japan for a while, though)  I had the opportunity of traveling to Japan recently for work and tourism, and colleagues here were consistently complaining about the current situation in which the Yen has reached its lowest value ever... HOWEVER, I have seen a MASSIVE amount of tourists visiting the country in a season (rainy season) that usually is not so popular to do so, being spring the rush season... my take is (obviously) the fact that a "cheaper" currency makes it more affordable for tourists to WANT to spend their money in the country (with a great deal of offers and a weak currency certainly allows tourists to buy goods, boosting the economy), however I would like to know your take on how this is/may affect other parts of the economy and if the problem of a weaker currency can be "fixed" since many colleagues (young laborers) were thinking on leaving the country due to how their wages become less competitive every day the Yen drops more and more  Just wanted to share my thoughts about this, since, as I told before, the amount of tourists (including myself in the bunch) has been increasing every day
日本人如果见到中国人, 日本人必须下跪, 日本人可以有点礼貌吗? 🥳
I'm not sure how the failure to reproduce looks in practice, but my suggestion would be to use zoning to create areas where breeders can live together. To live in this district you must be a breeder. Then to foment a good situation there, and to have it be successful. Then to take what was learned and create new areas that follow the lessons learned. Over time these districts and peoples would be viewed as super important and "heroic" to some degree for breaking out of the failing paradigm and having founded the winning paradigm.
5:00 Okay that's total nonsense. You're acting like people can just work 24/7. You can't work people into the ground expect a linear correlation to productivity. It's proven that's even just 30 hours a week people's productivity takes a big nosedive. People get tired, overworked, stressed, they need vacation, time off, food. Christ, I can't believe I have to explain this. Idk why "economists" just think of people like machines and think they should ignore their health and well being and their life.
For those of us who have spent a lot of time in Japan know that despite the worrying data, that looks bad by traditional western standards, Japan is an amazing place. High standard of living, excellent infrastructure, great education system, a vibrant culture, etc. Sure there are elements of the culture that look onerous and inhumane - the long work hours, the smaller housing accommodation, the extreme pressure on students - but that’s a relative measure. For example people from Singapore have some of those same aspects but see both the work hours and pressure on students as virtues.
Pls stop with that annoying tone.
I don't think migrants mean only upside; just look at what happened in western Europe - most immigrants don't work because of social benefits and cause lots of troubles by attacking (and killing) locals. One look at crime stats shows that allowing them into EU was a mistake. Just saying.
I'm surprised by many positive comments about Japan's regrowth. We Japanese are in despair over the decline of the Japanese economy. I almost cried when I saw your positive comments.
ありがとう

Oh nice I was actually looking at their welcome bonus. It's pretty generous. Got some extra cash to play with 💸
i know many people are praising japan to be good. but remember japan had the second most powerful economy, now this case isnt true anymore, there are many competitives like south korea, china, usa, and many europian countries that either surpased japan or will surpas is if japan dont start growing while the world is

*Guardian of the Past: When Stagnation is a Noble Choice:*                  By Andrea Zanzotto   "In the heart of a time-honored garden, where the soil whispers tales of unyielded tradition, stands a solitary Sakura tree, its roots entrenched deep within the nourished earth, untainted, pure. Each petal that blooms forth from its branches tells a saga of preservation, a testament to the sanctity of heritage that breathes within the heart of the land. There lies a serene pond, its waters clear and unblemished, reflecting a sky unmarked by the comings and goings of disparate winds.  Surrounding this sacred enclave are fences, not of barbed wire, but of woven silk, embodying a barrier that is both delicate and impenetrable, a symbol of choosing solitude over chaos, refinement over disarray. Beyond these bounds, one can glimpse the shadows of worlds intertwined, a mosaic of cultures clashing, losing their hues and shapes, becoming one indistinct mural of lost identities.  Yet, within the garden, time moves with grace, unhurried by the rush of changing eras, preserving the essence of a nation that values the purity of its lineage above the fleeting allure of a kaleidoscopic world. The Sakura stands majestic, a silent guardian of a philosophy that prizes the wealth of unaltered continuity over the tumultuous sea of diversity.  This haven does not yearn for the riches brought by golden fleets; rather, it finds wealth in the undisturbed peace of its solitude, a treasure chest sealed by the hands of its ancestors, untouched by the sands of time. It is a beacon of hope for those who seek refuge in the familiarity of their own reflection, rather than the myriad faces of an unfamiliar crowd.  In this realm, stagnation is not a curse but a choice—a noble stand against the dilution of essence, a statement that in the quietude of economic steadiness, there is a profound richness to be found. A uniqueness that thrives not on the voracious appetite for expansion but on the cultured restraint that comes with self-sufficiency and the wisdom of ages past.  Such is the garden of Japan, a unique ethnostate, where the music of its own history is enough to fill the air with melodies, where the art of maintaining one's culture becomes the most revered art of all. It is a corner of the world where the past and present dance in harmonious step, untouched by the jarring discord of external influences, a land that stands as a testament to the enduring power of unity and heritage."

アベノミクスのようなまっとうなマクロ政策をするならば成長するでしょうね。　 日本の諸悪の根源は財務省＆日銀　←ここが間違ったマクロ経済政策ばかりやってるから全然成長しなかった。 一番の理由は、この３０年間、日本だけがマネー量が全然少なかったってこと。 その結果、円高となりデフレになってしまった。　 でもこの失敗を日銀や財務省は決して認めてない。だからまた同じ過ちを繰り返すかもしれない。  経済音痴な総理によるアホみたいな政権が生まれたらそれこそやばいです。 デフレ歓迎、円高推進　みたいな　　 次期総理候補はマクロ経済に無知なのばかりなのでかなり危機的なのかもしれない。  とりあえず「デフレからの脱却」「積極財政」これだけは継続していかないと
I'm Japanese, but I've already given up. Please be kind to me after I look for work in your country. It's a crazy organization where humans are considered superior. They did an incomprehensible increase in consumption tax at the same time as monetary easing.
Hyperinflation incoming?
Japanese factories should return to Japan. 🇯🇵
i have many friends who own businesses in Japan, everyone says 2024 is the best year they've ever experienced since they were alive 40 years ago.
Japan's economy has been stagnant for 30 years, but today Japan is known as one of the safest, cleanest, and kindest countries in the world. What is the problem?
移民なんて必要ない 団塊がいなくなれば、国の未来のために金を使えるようになる 次の30年を優しい棺桶として乗り切るのか、姥捨山に連れて行くのか 問題はそれだけ
As long as they don’t listen to the WEF “import the third world to pump the numbers” maniacs, they should be alright. Their main thing should be adjusting the work culture so that the younger generation is both capable of and motivated to have families.
과거 미국이 일본을 견제하기 위해 한국에 지원해준 반도체 기술은 오늘날 한국이 미국의 믿음을 배신 하고 중국을 선택했기에 반도체 기술은 다시 일본으로 돌아갈 것입니다
まあ経済成長率が30年ほぼ上昇してないのと物価上昇に伴う平均賃金上昇率が上がってないのを除けば不満はない。労働環境の問題に関しては、労働者自身がちゃんと会社に交渉しないとダメな話ではあるよな気がする。
この人、日本の実態を見ていないのではないか、と思う。
It’s nothing wrong of Japanese economy, Japan has developed too much, its living standards is on top of the world, the country is very clean, very modern, orderly, very safe and civilized…It’s economy now is just slowing down (can’t growing for ever), so why need to be fixed??? Same as China, the economy there is starting to slowing down too, after 40 decades of fast growing… Western media just wanna exaggerate things in Asia, period. Life in Japan is much better than in the US, it’s one of the most livable country in the world.
Japan does not carry out censorship...
Earthquake and Tsunami, Corona pandemic, Ukraine War, Earthquake … God, please help Japan.

国家機密法は強行採決されたがまだまだ足りない。もっと強権的になるべきだ。そしてスパイ防止法がある欧米の方が強権的とは言えないだろうか？日本はこの法律がないせいで「スパイの天国」と呼ばれてしまっている。繰り返すが、政府の力が足りないのだ。増税と公共支出を同時に推し進めて大きな政府を狙うほかないだろう。
😂if japan is good,why japanese dont birth😅fact is that its economy sucks
Hoping to find some channel that openly says what the news really are:  "United States wants japanese people to buy more american useless things to make american rich even richer, so the dollar will be more expensive and thus the bonds will make more profit"
Long working hours and high suicide rates have improved considerably over the past decade, and both are now on par with European levels. The war in Ukraine and the U.S.-China conflict have brought capital that had been flowing out to China back into Japan. The pandemic has also provided an opportunity to spread modern information technology within Japan as well as to sell content industries such as anime and manga outside of the country.  I predict that the 2020s will be a bright time for Japan. The downward trend again will be when the political situation in China changes and capital starts to flow out again.
Japans' problems are numerous, but it's still the place I want to live. Life is one of tradeoffs and I think the benefits of living there outweigh the problems. I value stability, safety, and public transport a lot more than I value a stupid high salary
As 23 years old Japanese, I am satisfied with this country. We are not gorgeous like USA and  not energetic like china. But our lifestyle is simple and we can get small happiness like Izakaya and hot springs everywhere in this lovely country.
저는 일본이 부럽습니다. 일본의 민도, 경제적 관념, 기술력, 창의력 등 한국에게 있어서 배울 점이 매우 많은 국가라고 생각합니다.
The piece on Sony in the mobile markets isnt quite what it appears to be, though the mobile phone sales directly is true that they arent as influential, Sony makes and distrubutes parts of mobiles phones, mainly camera sensors for almost every major mobile phone brand, they just changed what they were selling and to who in terms of the phone industry
実際、日本経済の絶頂期から今まで不景気やら好景気やらあったけどいつでも貧しいと感じたことはないし、とてつもなく安定してるってのはいいことかもしれないけど、それは国内だけの話で、海外は物価が上がるからその分海外製品がどんどん高くなっていくのはつらいね。  あと、恥の文化だとか失敗を恐れるとか言われるけど、全くそんな空気は感じないし、1980年台の日本経済を妬んだ評論の名残に過ぎないと思う。 それに、同調圧力とかいうけれど、例えば個人主義が強いアメリカでも個人をより強く主張しなければならないという同調圧力に屈してるに過ぎないから、全くそんなことはないね。
アップルとグーグルの時価総額については日本でも、日本企業の崩壊の話のテーマになります。 ヨーロッパにはアップルやグーグルに相当する洒落たオフィスのあるハイテックな素晴らしい企業が沢山あるのでしょうね。
I am now living in Japan lived in Western Europe. As the statistics says, the salary in Europe was higher but didn’t feel a rich country as a citizen. Increase of living costs, high crime rate, e.t.c.  On the other hand, except for the salary, living in Japan is like a being in a real home. Delicious and cheap food, reliable public order, low unemployment . It’s true that Japan is struggling with problems though, this nation is still a powerhouse and has a potential to regrow.
日本には二つの道がある。 2100年までに日本の人口は半分になると予想されているが、一つは2100年までの間に移民を受け入れ治安の良さと文化を犠牲にして無理やり人口を増やしムスリムと黒人だらけのクソ国になるか、二つ目は人口は半分になるが移民受け入れを拒否し治安の良さと文化を維持したまま今の北欧に少しあるような福祉国家を目指すか。
Japan does not need fixing ! many citizens around the world want to go and live there , as they are fed up with the mess created by politicians in their countries
Your knowledge regarding the media in Japan is simply wrong. The Japanese press are completely free. Many major Newspapers are against the government
The US has imported culture from Japan after its defeat in the war, but the culture contains a lot of the US's postwar education. The collapse of Japan is the collapse of America. China is aiming for that. Will we fall together, or will we return the Katana and education to Japan? Please choose.
The US should return the Katana and education to Japan. It was the US that wiped it out. You should study history.
Everybody thought and called Japanese are diligence and creative but now the quality of Japanese are going down and down. Due to political inaction, many Japanese have lost hope for the future and believe that it is better not to work if working does not make their lives easier. Eventually, Japan will be destroyed because no one will work.
The biggest reason for Japan's decline is the aging population, the labor force is declining every year, how can the economy grow when there are less people working? Japan is now trying very hard to use robots to replace manpower, it is true that Japan is a robotics powerhouse, they have Fanuc, Yaskawa and other world-renowned robotics companies, but the problem is that the manufacture of robotics need raw materials, electricity, steel and so on all need to import from foreign countries, and Japan is a small island with no resources, so it is very difficult to solve the problem in Japan. The hope for the future is nuclear fusion power generation plus electric cars plus robots, I hope Japan can succeed.
The amount of clueless weebs who don't work and live in Japan in this comment section though! 😂
They’ll be fine, their economy is shrinking as they’ve passed the peak of their economic stardom, but they’ll be fine, they’ll still be a 1st world country, unlike a lot of developing countries will never be developed countries unfortunately
Our government policies are so stupid, making interest rates keeping low while many countries in the world have risen it up, which result in weakened yen.
Japan’s work culture results in lower productivity and lower birth rate.
Curious how the video is a month old (today) and at 13:06 you say 10000 Y is about $200 "today"???   That's some enthusiastic rounding!
I'm a Japanese person living in Japan, and I feel that it's safer now than it was in the 80s and 90s, and it's more economically and culturally affluent. It is wrong to judge only by economic numbers. Until 30 years ago, Japanese people worked hard from morning until night, but now they have fewer working hours, less time to study, and more freedom. It is natural that GDP will increase if the number of production workers increases, and Japan's elderly have money and receive pensions, so I think it is only a small number of young people who have become poor.
移民とポリコレやめて下さい
日本は衰退を続けるのは間違いないです。😢 一番の原因は少子高齢化です。 若者の絶対数の減少はイノベーションの減少、次世代の子供の減少、生産年齢人口の減少、消費者、生産者の減少を引き起こします。
Why you are so fast ? There is no subtitles also. It's very hard to understand.
to contrast the top companies ranking, u should put that in the 80s, 90% or so of the top companies in the whole world were Japanese.
秘密保護法によって日本のメディアが政府批判に委縮したというナラティブは虚偽です。日本のメディアは政府に対し、一貫として嘘に満ちた攻撃を繰り返しています。移民に対する抵抗は言語の問題ではなく、日本人が経済成長より社会の平和を望んでいるからです。労働力欲しさに無暗に移民を受け入れた国がどうなっているか、解っているでしょう。日本はあのような社会は望みません。
plaza accord??
Japan lags much behind Korea in terms of 4th revolutionary technology. Japan is declining country in every perspective of technology and industry.
Wait...do they really work 80 hours a week ?
It was just like the typical videos I've seen and I was disappointed. The media often talks about Japan's low production efficiency, but in terms of working-age population, Japan is almost the same as Germany. Japan has continued to implement labor reforms and improvements since the bursting of the bubble economy, and the results of these efforts are reflected in OECD data. Furthermore, despite Japan having the fastest aging population in the world and a declining birth rate, It is a miracle that Japan is ranked among the top economic powers.
The country stagnated after DBZ ended, it's pretty obvious
10K JPY is not 200 USD lol
私は海外居住の日本人ですが、本当に日本は豊かだと思います。清潔な町、モラルの高い人々。この世界に日本をバカにできる国はありません。あなたの国は失業者が多く汚い
here after the recession?
As a Japanese, I consider Japan as one of the most successful communist nation in the world. Like explained in the video, people's wage is not good (compared to Western nations), but most people can live a pretty stable life because there's a pretty good infrastructure, healthcare, and education system.
make japan great again
Hmmm, not a day goes by without hearing some criticism of the government on a Japanese TV show.
Or maybe they just don't want immigrants. Is that really so hard to comprehend?
As long as Japan keeps kissing the as#hole of US, it can never be fixed.
10:01 im surprised that Arabic is the second most used secondary language in the world after English
Infinite growth is unsustainable anyway. Nothing wrong with a stable economy.
Japan's problem is NOT their economy. It's population decline!
Can anyone explain what 'Japan is a country that's been living in the year 2000 since the 1970s' means? What makes you think Japan is outdated? I thought most developed countries are stuck at their peak of development. As a Japanese person, I think almost everything is pretty well-maintained and updated to the newest version when needed, but I'd love to know everyone's opinion!

人口を増やそうとしない政府がアホ
This segment is based on ASSUMPTION and stupidity. Media is free to say what they like. They are not monitored by the Japanese government. Where they get their idea on Japanese monitoring is media outlets is where the sponsors of this channel should be worried about. Falsely reporting data that is not true.
Why does this guy speak so fast?
For all its advancements, Japan's culture is still comparatively quite backwards. Female representation on company boards and in government is very low, and agree that their society is "insular," if they arent producing enough babies, theres no way they would be open to immigrants to boost their worker numbers.
Four out of ten people don't want to leave the house and the people who do don't resent them, unless they start to believe in things together. They are miserable together and the other kind are miserable apart. By eating, defecating and sleeping the distanced form the backbone of the weeping, laughing, ranting beast, the great illusion
Let some of us Dutch males in Japan Repopulate with Japanese women.
theres absolutely nothing wrong with japans economy, this is ridiculous.
💀
1:53  you are completely wrong on this. It's not the law or anything. The reporter's club(Kisya-club) that is dictating media outlets is the reason why we can't have good government criticism on media.  if you take a look at X, there are insane amout of people criticizing government(most of them aren't valid, tho)
The biggest factor is that fiscal policies and tax systems that have continued to lower real wages are weighing on Japan's potential. It has a stable economic base with domestic demand exceeding 60% of GDP, Financial assets per person also change depending on the exchange rate, but it's not bad at all. Furthermore, Japan is a rare entity in the OECD that has relatively few problems, as it holds a variety of long-term energy resource purchase contracts and has succeeded in stabilizing prices.
looks like the retro collectors are shopping there now after they watch this Edit: this was just a harmless joke
Japan is a failed state in every aspect promoting fake capitalism what is socialism in disguise a example could be found in there QE also commonly referred to as crime of the century, another example could be there repo inheritance tax...Problem is that socialism always leads to a slow and steady decline as it moves away from efficiency....The country is beyond saving it hes last it ways and now there socialism is culturaly ingrained ...making the collapse unavoidable... witouth extreme measures...where they dont have the guts for.
I wish I'd seen this video before moving to japan :'(
Having lived in Japan, I can tell you that a large number of the population are actively hostile to the idea of immigration. The government and news media seem to spend a lot of time blaming the country’s’ ills on ‘those foreigners’. This makes the impenetrability of the country even harder to deal with which is a shame as it’s a fascinating place.
imo, Japan is just unique.
Is the yen stuck at this level for good? I feel their economy isn’t what it was and a return to the norm just isn’t going to happen anymore.
leave japan alone from your western concepts and ideas of immigration
Originally from New Zealand, I’ve lived in Japan for more than a decade. This video is spot on, but I think it misses the cultural shift happening in the population. Young people aren’t ambitious and want a stable job and a stable life. If things continue as they have, that’s fine and dandy, but there are a lot of indicating factors that are starting to show cracks in the systems. If they’re lucky, AI and robots will replace of needed workers they’re going to know when 60% of the population will be over 80 in 20 years.
You kinda hit the point of how to grow an economy but left iut the biggest factor for these things to be possible. Consumer demand. If there are more workers that means more output but there is not a bigger demand then its going to literary do nothing. Thats why exports are so important, they maje that you can grow your output and with that still grow gdp. But if the product is not in demand abroud. Then your in missluck. Thats aswell why having a big amount of uppermiddle class. As they spend the most of their money and have a large amount of buying and investing in local bussiness.
Having done business in Japan for more than 15 years, and having visited there more than 30 times what I can say for certain is that the Japanese would rather lose their way than win doing something another way. Their almost universal belief their way is best, that Japanese are superior race, have superior intelligence - it is at times comical. If Japan is the future, I say no thank you!
They do not charge enough for their products; Japanese Automobile and Electronic Products last, on average, for a lot longer, yet they do not charge for the value of their product's reliabilities.
Aah Economics Explained; your video titles never fail to entice panic and worry! Keep it going
Have you ever come across any strong counter arguments to your overall conclusion? With someone that has a high caliber education as yourself. I'm interested because I would like to compare the two. One thing I notice about social media or any articles, they really on bat for their best argument, and sometimes that creates a echo chamber.
"Something Weird Is Happening in Japan" - there is always something weird going on there, it's Japan lol.
that´s why I left my mother country, Japan....
Doesn't their tourism bring about more money?
Garbage presentation. Libertarian nonsense combined with obviously very little first hand familiarity with Japan.
"Abundance of very cheap housing all over the city"...Have you trieed to live in Tokyo? It's among the highes real estate value in the world.
I always say that I want to retire in Japan but have no desire to work there.
Living in japan for 12years long time work and low paid,and very stressful society if anyone want to come I would say STOP !
Going through the comments there seems to be a lot of praise for the Japanese that they are able to maintain their standard of living despite the many hurdles thrown against them. Personally, I feel quite conflicted since the living standards are held up in part by the Japanese who are always giving their best in whatever they are doing. Living here and having been to clubs and university I noticed my colleagues often choose more laborious was of doing a task, making it seem as if they are obliged to do so.  I really hope the situation and working culture changes in the near future. Watching my coworkers always makes me sad.
2:09 Japan competes with other island nations - for top island nations model 😂. What if everyone could go anywhere and nobody picks your country?  (United Nations)
0:48 I think it’s because Japan has it going on! Old people are making homes available for young people.  It’s clean.  People are nice.  Everyone is eating and can enjoy the surroundings- did you see the landscape?  Japan deserves a we have it together award 🏆
That's a Honda CRZ, not a civic.
"Japanese mobile phones were considered advanced..." like when? I'd say Nokia was more prized than any Japanese phone. Japanese garakei were hobbled by the Galapagos phenomenon. If you have details on this assertion I'd love to hear it, but having lived in Japan 1996-2023, I seriously dunno what you're talking about...
10,000¥ isn't worth 200$...
Could Japan have benefitted from a more ambitious space program? Just this month, Japan landed on the Moon. Better late than never.
Evaluating that Japan has not grown in 30 years is proof that we are only looking at the surface. Due to the rapid appreciation of the yen, Japanese companies have sought overseas markets and invested worldwide, resulting in almost no increase in Japan's domestic GDP. has contributed to the increase in (The United States and Germany also contributed to China's GDP increase) Developed countries are currently withdrawing from China, but Japan's revival will lead to a weaker yen. It depends on how much you can return to your country by using it.
But… 10.000¥ are not 200$. It’s around 100$
Economists citing pop growth as a sign of strenth will soon be obsolete in their views. AI offsets almost all pop declines and will make this type of measurement outdated and a sign of the old guard who have no place in future society. Expecting capitalism to continue as usual is just psychotic. There is no such thing as infinite growth.
Japan will rise again, makes no mistake!
I'm a foreign Software Engineer working in Tokyo and I've never worked more than 40 hours a week. Salaries in my field are comparable to what you would earn Australia and Western Europe. There's some truth in terms of how large the homes and apartments are, but if you're making 15~20M+ JPY you won't be living out of a shoebox.
Great video but you talk so fast that it’s nearly impossible to understand
I think this is why China create lazy people in other countries using tiktok in the right time where enough people relying their income on tiktok they will close the app and many will be unemployed and useless
Japan was progressing so rapidly that USA had to sabotage and crash it. Japan never recover since then.
Are we gonna talk about how the picture for the Honda civic was actually for a Honda CR-Z?
As a country whose companies still use fax, it's pretty clear that they have absolutely no desire to grow or improve, but would rather stay stable and trust their traditional ways.
During my time in Japan, I was struck by Tokyo's intriguing urban planning. Just wandering the streets, you feel the vibrant blend of uses. Amid bustling districts, pockets of tranquil homes persist. And shops sprinkle even quiet neighborhoods, creating an integrated mosaic. This organic mix makes the city feel truly alive.
I feel like it's impressive that japan has stayed economical and that globalism might really benefit them/ is really benefiting them.
Pushing women into the workforce is a terrible idea for any country that is not currently being invaded.
To say that Japan will not adapt innovative productivity measures is not entirely true. In their work culture they embrace the notion of "Kaizen" which means to always seek a methodical and incremental improvement. It is the reason that Toyota still has some of the most efficient auto manufacturing and highest quality output. As an island nation without a great store of natural resources, a cultural bent toward refinement has been key to their success.
The US isn't a great country to be living in either, it's people work insane hours for very little pay and living conditions are not too great either as racism and crime is rather rampant there. This not even mentioning the high costs for a apartment that isn't even half decent. It would be similar to start living in a warzone, it's foolish.
Still waiting to hear “something weird is happening”. Sounds like click bait. Good job.
Whenever I hear economist say "limitless growth" I have to pinch myself to check if I'm not dreaming 😅
Something I didn't see mentioned in the video is the lack of participation in the global economy in regards to industry. Japan doesn't have many natural resources, so they will import a raw material say iron, or ready made steel. They will turn it into a car, and then sell that back to the global economy. That is only for global citizens who need a car, though. Have a quick look around your house for things "Made in Japan" and, unless you are actually in Japan, you won't find much. Your car, maybe your Inugami Korone figurine, thats about it. Japan's industry, for the most part, can not even begin to satisfy global demand for whatever product they might be making, so they don't bother. They participate in their internal economy only. Making only enough product to satisfy local demand and that is it.  I believe this plays a very large role in why their economy is stagnant. They do not participate in the global market and stick to their own. Very Japanese.
There are downsides to opening to legal migration when it attracts illegal migration. Japan would be worse opening itself more. Sadly much of illegal migration is filled not with people that needs help (in that case they couldn't afford to cross oceans and many countries) but opportunists that actually could open a business in their home countries. Japan is doing fabulously in contrast to what could have happened otherwise.
"Argentina had every chance to be successful"... so I think that the military coup, backed by the U.S. was one of those chances, right?
"Immigration is only upside for the receiving country" you mean aside from ethnically replacing the original population?
Something Weird Is Happening in Japan? lol Sheesh lets try America.
Japan's politics and economy are structured in such a way that politicians and people in the ruling class become wealthy. As a result, wages have not increased for 30 years, leaving ordinary people in poverty. Nothing will change unless this evil system is eliminated. Unfortunately, because Japanese people are not good at English, almost no posts from Japanese even though such a beneficial videos regarding Japanese economy.
Western people are so obsessed with economic growth. What is wrong with just having a stable economy and having enough to eat and have some fun. Not everyone wants to own 200 ferraries and a 3 hectare home.
Fascinating stuff, really enjoyed this. Having lived in Japan for the past year, I feel an underlying cause of the stagnation is the culture of age-based hierarchy. The older you are, the more power you have, and the older you are, the less you're likely to be open to innovation. The people that are resisting this, meaning people who are growing up with the internet, are the same people that are interested in studying/working abroad and maybe move out of the country indefinitely.
Japan hasn't been successful in the same way that would be expected from before. It's like they can't use their advantages for their own benefit in the current world. From the outside, it seems like they would have no problems, which probably isn't true in the reality. It is not known, what are the main problems there and why they are not succeeding as expected from how they seem. It's like something is in the way of their success and preventing it from starting or going forward. No-one knows their problems from the outside, that are usually expected not to exist at all. It seems like technology and industry would fit well in Japan and that they would have no problems in implementing them for their success. It seems like they have a large population for their benefit and that there would be no problems for them in creating industries, businesses and financial achievements in the country. It's like if they have them all, why should anyone help them or why they should need help? Nothing tells anything different or gives any information about anything other that would be something more real than this.
Let me guess, this video mentions that they need immigration to survive.
Haha housing is affordable in Japan. Very funny
maybe young people in japan do not generally maintain the same sentiment and traditions of hard work/productivity because they have been able to grow up comfortably, horrific pasts not in sight? so, in the face of recent economic decline current workers are equanimous. i do think that population decline because of elderly population is a problem, but maybe won't be that huge of an issue.
its the shibuya incident
アメリカとか盲腸で手術費が高額で自己破産せんとあかんやんけｗ そんな国に住みたいとかマゾしかおらんやろｗ
Excellent explanation of real estate
Japan is leading on real estate affordability and border integrity.
Another video about japan????
Japan is doing better only becaause they never raised interest rates, helping to devalue their Yen by about 25%>>> it made their exports cheaper for other countries to buy.
Japanese development is one of the miracles in human history. How can they not collapse like the other countries after a tremendous economic crisis. And there are not many people studying this phenomenon.
They work more than Americans, but have a higher standard of living. Give take don’t think one is worse or better. China and Norway is a better comparison, I agree. One advantage Japan has is more regulations on pricing corporations are forced to comply with, where in America, a payout is worth the price of anti consumer practices
USA crippled Japanes economy via the Plaza accords.
A Japanese economist said, if you can get a lunch in Japan for one 500 Yen Coin (3,375 US $), you can't compete with the US, where a lunch can cost 20 $ (2963 Yen). The low wages are a root of the problem, which prevents economic growth. On the other side constant wages at declining prices for high quality Products and services, will guarantee a high living standard.
The Japanese industrial companies kept growing by building factories in foreign countries and hiring locals there. Nowadays South East Asia is a working bench for Japanese companies just like China was in the past. Furthermore, Japanese companies have factories in Western Countries like Europe and US as well. So, companies can grow by getting out of their home market.  Unlike the production companies, the service companies didn’t expand into foreign markets. Japanese Supermarkets and Mobile Phone companies are concentrating on Japanese consumers, unlike their European competitors, who are expanding outside their home countries.
Japan needs diversity. Strong young Black men would inject a dose of vitality into Japanese culture.
Time stamp 18:16... "Paul Krugman, potentially, one of the most influential economist alive today" LOL That has to be the funniest thing I have ever heard. That guy is a walking disaster when it come to economic predictions and policies.
something interesting to add wrt housing prices in Japan is that unlike many other countries, and in particular the United States, land, and whatever is built on the land are assessed separately, which in conjunction with heavy taxes on unutilized structures, means that housing is a depreciating asset, especially if you’re not living in it. In my city in the US, there are infamously many homes and apartments sitting empty because real estate companies can buy them, sit on them while they accrue value, and keep them off the market to keep prices up by controlling supply. In Japan this wouldn’t be a profitable business. If you have property there you use it, rent it, or sell it. Otherwise depreciation on the structure and taxes add up quickly.
Toyota and Honda will be a drag on Japan's economy unless they jump on the EV bandwagon. Otherwise, they'll fail and their citizens will buy EVs from China.
This is just inconclusive rumbling about Japan without a proper path of conclusions.
oh so is not the lack of job opportunities in the market that is holding people from working, no instead is just because they don't want
backwards society. the country is dead
One important element of housing: houses are built for about 30-40 years, ie their value zeros down… On long term it means people will end up without housing, which off course economists do not see now comming
It sounds like the main issues with Japan are the work culture and birth rate tbh. They're not profiting from skilled workers leaving poorer countries, they've got low inflation (which is actually good from the perspective of people and not corporate entities), housing is affordable and available etc. If they can fix the work culture and make people want to have children again (which is largely a vote of confidence in the future well-being of a country) without unbalancing everything else then they're set.
Living in Japan. What you're forgetting is the infrastructure. The best in world by an order of magnitude. Costs of maintenance are high and so it is where the money flows. Not everything is about output and hockey stick chart to the top right corner.
when the Japanese economy was growing non-stop Japan was pressured by the US into signing the Plaza Accord and thus crippling its own economy and entering into a major recession today known as the Lost Decade. Not happy with that, the US went ahead and simultaneously placed 100% tariffs on Japanese electronics. Tariffs Japan wasn't even allowed to match or even retaliate in any way.
8:15. I have never thought about it like that. A country spends resources to maintain and produce bright minds just for that person to find opportunity elsewhere. Really makes you wonder how certain countries would be if there was better retention.
Covid and inflation were nothing but positive to Japan - Covid because it forced Japan to modernize itself and become more efficient, inflation for the reasons you mentioned.   As for immigration, it's obvious why Japan wouldn't want to let anyone in. For one, Japan is a country where most of the rules are unspoken, you are just supposed to know - because everyone knows. Japanese people simply do not know how to interact with people who do not know these codes, and it's extremely hard to understand them - let alone apply them correctly - unless you grew up there. By Japanese standards, most people are rude and not well behaved, so not only is the experience difficult but it can also become unpleasant to them.  Two, even disregarding this aspect of Japanese culture, just one look at the countries that did allow mass immigration and it's obvious why a country that values peace and security above all wouldn't want any part of it.  As for working long hours, it is a cultural thing. They do it because it is in their mentality, but many people finish their work on time, go home and get praised for their efficiency. It is mainly an overblown cliche at this point, remaining from 30 years ago when Japan had aspirations to become the biggest world economy and people were working like crazy.
Ugh...  By calling Paul Krugman one of the best economists in the world, you lost credibility.
had to stop at 7:52 :(
Economists, cancer, and tax collectors are the only people primarily interested in growth for growth's sake only. Sustainability and quality should be higher priority.
USA is funny on paper such a giant economy, but in reality it feels like a developing country.
Too many of Japan her citizens also do not believe their economy has stagnated and it actually on a rise but just at  slower pace. Those same people also do not believe Japan needs foreigners to boost the economy.
Regardless of the question of whether growth should be preferable to stability, investing in new technology to at least keep up with competitors is as essential in the long run to investing in infrastructure, and largely for the same reasons.
I’d like to see a comparison between Japan and South Korea.
6:10 One thing that was not brought up for increasing the labor participation rate is institutionalizing un-paid labor. If child/eldercare, housekeeping, or cooking are paid, they show up in GDP when they otherwise wouldn't. A good example of this is that childcare in the US is typically unpaid, while elder care is paid.
Why do you need GDP growth when your population is not growing?
In my opninion, I think the culture of extreme work environment and working late hours without getting payment is harming the creativity and productivity of Japan work force in the long term.
Japan actually HAS a chance to revive itself by acquiring talented immigrants from China, especially those who strongly tend to "run away" due to political issues.
thinking that economic growth mean something is BS consumism is BS
( ^ω^ )

日本！🗾🗾🗾🗾🗾🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🎌🎌🎌🎌🎌

I love this country. Shining star in the whole world
Acknowledging this is an economics channel, there are powerful cultural and historic reasons why Japan doesn’t favour migration, which is probably more important here than economic motivators.
Japanese are best engineers in world.  Germans was up to them but Germans get enriched racially.  If Japanese keep be pure breed prosperity is guaranteed for them forever.
your presenting ''rueters'' as independent media?
I don't know if such a thing already exists, but it'd be nice if there was some sort of global entity that dealt with migration, facilitating the transit of people between overcrowded countries and those in need of manpower. I know there a lot of non-profits that deal with migration, but I'm talking about something with a UN level of international presence. Having a global mobile workforce not tied to the land seems like something that would benefit everyone, at least on paper.
"Line didn't go up so something wrong" and other such phrases uttered by the spiritually oblivious More to a good life and health than a big green line.
I don't know why people take Krugman seriously, the dude literally said in the 1998 that _"by 2005, it would become clear that the Internet's effect on the economy is no greater than the fax machine's"_
The problem is that GDP is a very poor indicator of wellbeing: $1000 in computers from the 1980s bring much less benefits than $1000 in computers from the 2020s. GDP brings the false impression that goods and services values stay "the same" no matter how much time passes. One better way to measure wellbeing would be how many hours of work are needed to afford for rent, taxes and daily expenses.
I feel like I've already seen this video 20 times already
If the economy isn't shrinking faster than the population, then there is no need to "fix" it.
Now explain what's wrong with the USA and England.
I like how the video is just a single hair's width away from saying "Japan's economic problems are deeply and decisively rooted in their cultural problems", which is mirrored nicely by the comment section, where the arrow is flipped and says "the Western world's economic problems are deeply and decisively rooted in their cultural problems".  Consequently, you can't make an effective economic assessment without a cultural assessment, or the other way around.
From my perspective as a middle-class Japanese family living in Japan, it is true that the economy has been stagnant for 20 years and is slowly declining further. However, prices have not fluctuated much, and salaries have risen slightly in line with the fluctuations. I don't know about other countries, but if I can maintain this situation, no more, no less, I'm fine with it. I believe that long term stability is the only way to have a better outlook on life and to be happy in the future. Life is not a gamble.
13:04 A 10000 Yen note isn't worth 200 USD today. More like a third of that.
yea broooo jsut flood japan with millions of foreign immigrants. worked well for Europe amirite!?
Tokyo is affordable ?????? No NO NO
This video is interesting to watch as an anthropological documentary about the ideological propaganda which influenced its maker. A brilliant obvervation of an imprisoned "cultured" mind.
https://www.youtube.com/@100_Million_Views
We should be concerned. We need a strong Japan to contain China and Russia. It's clear they have ambitions that go beyond their borders
Growth for growth's sake is cancer man. Take a chill pill
as long as Japan has to do whatever US told, nothing will change in Japan
It would have been a very interesting piece had I been able to hear it. Please, don't talk so fast. If time is an issue, make it a 2 part piece. Thanks.
Maybe you could try to speak a little faster, so that non-native English speakers for sure can't get what you are saying anymore.
You said Japan could not increase working hours any further, which is not true. Japan has considerably reduced its working hours from the 70s to the 90s, and Now working hours are below those of the U.S. And we have considerably more holidays than other countries. i mean if we stop working like Europe and go back to the old days and work hard, we can achieve the 2nd largest GDP in the world like 30~10 years ago, but none of the young Japanese today want that.
How did Argentina have every chance to succeed while getting sucked dry with exploitative IzMF loans?
日本は、資本主義のお面を被った社会主義国って、いい加減気がつけ。  秘密保護法と言論の自由は別だ。都内なんぞは、平和的にデモもしょっちゅう起きてるわ。  中国は言論の自由が無いけど、経済は日本より資本主義的でしょうに。  日本と中国は、思想と経済が真逆なんだよ。もちろん、アメリカともね。  社会福祉がきちんとしてるかしてないか、そっちが問題だよ。  あと、人口が減少する事は悪い事では無いよ。生産性が低かろうと、団塊世代の人数が多過ぎて、就職氷河期に仕事は無かった。  国民の数が減るからこそ、やっと仕事も回ってくるのに、移民なんぞ入れたら意味なし。
8:00 it also causes a LOT of problems for the nation they're migrating to. lol
The only weird thing is literally the whole rest of the world 😂
japan is so over rated. they still use fax machine LOL ! everything is analog there while the world has moved on to digital long time ago.
@Economics Explained - This video doesn't mention the unequal overseas immigration recruitment to Japan. Which only allows certain nation's people able to work for in Japan for long-term. Also the high-education workers from advance nations has limitations that leads to short-term employments. A lot of businesses unwilling to hire non-Asian; will do rotation employment for westerns that is cheaper and keeping options open than hiring full-time. Employers are likely to hire basic education person from a poor nation than one from a advance nation with same education.The sponsorship of visa for foreigners is misunderstood to look hard for local and small business to apply. Also there is a lack of recruitment agencies that offer services to advance overseas workers.
Overall alot of yapping and in the end everything is the same.
Great video but why do you talk like a Valley girl?
Weebs taking over the comment section
Kudos for the brief mention of Japanese culture not overly fond of outsiders. Objectively Japanese xenophobia is a significant factor and deserves greater in-depth analysis.
The Japanese stock market is about to reach its highest level since the bubble era. Why? Because everyone knows its economy is stable.
Nicely
Limitless growth is unsustainable, we need to stop look at economic "stagnation" as a bad thing and should be looking at it as the goal. As these past four years have shown, we've hit a point where only really the richest of the rich are benefiting from this. Something has to give, and when it does, it's going to be bad if we don't break away from this nonsense.
Most people here fail to grasp Japanese culture. Over 2023 many everyday prices have gone up 20% but you only see half of it. How? Well for instance your lunch bowl of rice or rāmen is 10% more expensive _and_ you get 10% less rice or rāmen without being able to prove it. Keep this mundane exemple in mind next time you hear that Japanese value harmony and dislike conflict. Dishonesty and hypocrisy permeates every social and economic interactions for the sake of keeping face.
Japanese people have had their lives stolen by the Japanese corporations they work for. They literarily are born to work.
The way Japan goes they won't have a population to fuel their economy. They could learn a lot on growing population from India and Bangladesh where their population has no limits as evident on them riding on train tops.
I live in Japan, been here for 17 years. This country is sinking. The death rate is insane, the government is following the US too much and being its lap dog more than ever. It is focused on globalist agenda like SDG and with litle to no thought of the impact it will have on the society in the future. They are putting their efforts into programs like MOONSHOT and such.  They keep their population dumb, have you ever watched TV here? It makes Ant and Dec look like Open University.   The English is still terrible , which is completely done on purpose. They don’t care about getting their students speaking English despite spending more than most countries on the planet on it.   It’s a mess. A beautiful, glorious country, with great people, but it’s a sinking mess. It won’t be here in a hundred years. Not like this.
Of course limitless growth is impossible. The planet is limited in size and resources. All our energy comes from the sun, or nuclear. We could turn the planet into a factory designed to consume itself, killing every animal and planet in the process, but why do that?   Every problem we have could be fixed by people not having kids. With tech as it is now, a world with a billion people or less would be a nice place.
What's even  more bothering and annoying to me is that Japanese conservative conspiracy theorists blame the US for Japan's stagnation. They argue that the US is suppressing Japan's development because they are afraid that Japan might lose control again ever since WW2. Japan should stop making excuses and start getting their *ss up without interfering with the US's power.
Who cares about GDP? I don't want my government to have more revenue. That's not my problem.
Holla jappan may drem❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤. Karatt
Japan's economy will start to grow when they get rid of their astronomical debt.  So when they go bankrupt.
I was surprised to realize that Japan’s debt to GDP ratio was pretty much the worst on the planet.
Mentioning "long hours" of Japan is an annoying factual error, Japanese work hours are on European level
日本ってこんな注目されてるんだな。意外や。
I think being stagnant in Japan is being seen in Japan as being stable.
"Something weird is happening in Japan"  yeah...a functioning, sustainable, socially responsible society.  SO WEIRD
Paul Krugman has been wrong on every prediction he has made.
The Argentina roast was unnecessary... 😂
can japan be "fixed"? NO. its a few years left for this human wave. their ego will not make them able to do that before that due date. the problem they have with young people reluctant to have descendants, is due to the majority of the young there currently  living a life that would make them feel embarrassed to their children if they have any later. believe me thats the real reason. and also the part of why japan has some of the world's worse parent-children relationships. and produces and raises arrogant humans as a result. despite all the bow and the mannerism. you will find some of the most arrogant humans lives there. and they are embarrassed to face their children. so they becomes cold hearted to their kids. serious problem. and no intent to fix that. a few years left.
From the Japanese viewpoint, we don't feel economic growth. However, many are satisfied. but we have to change our mind for the future generation
I live in Japan. While are generally agree with EE, this video misses the mark on a bunch of things. Stability for one. I would also say Japanese households are not too small, just other places are too big. The general standard of living here is superb. I would say one of the main negatives that Japan is unfortunately not tackling, is the very low English level for most of the population.
stopped watching when I heard that 10000 yen is worth 200USD
I thought Japan had a good record on freedom of speech?
Japan has to confront it's ageing population. Their state pension fund is in dire straits.
If we could only get away from the "perpetual growth" formula and "pyramid schemes" masquerading as  government, then perhaps we would potentially be able to save ourselves on the planet and avoid the next mass extinction we are causing.
The USA since the 2020 election has had uncontrolled immigration. These are people who decide to disrespect America and steal prosperity from it's citizens. This is NOT the type of immigration EE proposes is the norm.
Sure apartments in Japan are small but you don't have to go far even in Tokyo to find regular suburbia with normal sized houses.
Very good in-dept informative video, ngl.
I can fix her
The problem iin Japan is really its old generation bringing everything down with them. ts insane
No i don't want to live in Norway. Please understand not every one is white people
What if…they don’t care about your measurements and are focused on other goals?
“Not overly fond of outsiders” such understatement. 😂
useless video
i hope that people start to realize infinite economic growth is not possible and shouldnt be any country's goal. having all citizens live a good life should be the goal. and as long as japan is stable, its perfectly fine.
I swear every time I watch your videos I can't help but thing you're being paid to promote propaganda:  From your videos I get a lot of interesting information, but then a lot of information that does not make sense (you said "japan has always has low inflation, so companies cannot raise the prices of goods"... but it is the other way around-> the rising prices are the cause of inflation. You present inflation as the cause, but it is an effect) and the general idea of your videos seems counter-intuitive: "something WEIRD is happening in Japan"... Weird? Really? Most things you said about Japan are positive, but you make it sound as if they're negative... Hard dislike from me.
Let's be honest: Western libertarian free marketeers have wrecked their own countries
The Japanese I kno say they're watching what is happening in the West and would rather slowly decline, than rapidly change their culture from immigration .
Rumor or probably truth has it that Japan is doing nuclear experiments with US underground. That's why earthquakes frequently repeated these years and after the disaster Japanese government accepted aids ONLY form US.
Your exposition is completely flawed. thumbs down.
Pitiful doubtful video!
Plant more trees more flowers 🌺 more fruit
lol criticizing Japan for not being open to being pillaged into oblivion by neoliberal economics like America has been
Japan was astopped by the USA with a made up crisis... watch Princes of the Yen documentary
The city is clean. There are many tech companies, even if not top of the world.  The food is delicious and the number of Michelin stars is the highest in the world.  The city is safe and the people are calm. What else you want?
Its always a bit weird to me when Japans zoning is praised as this genius invention when it isnt really that much different from Germany for example, or really much of Europe i assume. Its just that US zoning is pants on head retarded. The reason Japan has affordable housing and Germany doesnt isnt zoning, its that they have let their population numbers shrink along with the sub-replacement birthrate while Germanys population is still growing with about the same birthrate because we import many, many migrants. Thus, we have an affordable housing crisis and feel overpopulated, while in Japan you can really feel the impact of sub-replacement and the number of akiyas grows steadily, with some towns entirely abandoned.
海外の人たちコメントを見てみると、日本のことを過大評価している人と過小評価している人の二極化をしているなと感じる。
若い日本人より海外の人の方が日本経済や日本の未来について心配してくれてる気がする😢
Japan is approaching a "low growth, high quality of life" society. Stagnation isnt completely bad if society is still orderly. Its when the quality of life starts collapsing is when things get really bad.
tldr?
Japan is the only country where I can own 13 houses and feel safe at the same time.  Everything here is AFFORDABLE...good balance.  Been here 24 years and love it.
But ask yourself, would you rather live in china or japan if these are the only two options left? We do not just look at the numbers.
Thank the US-dictated Plaza Accord for Japan's stagnation.   It's crazy that it remains in pro US dream-state.
Id rather have thier economy then the wests, curruption in the west far exceeds japan in every single way
Another good video, excellent work. I actually saw this video while visiting. Just a thought, but maybe Japan pays off its innovation cycle, rather than letting continuous change become a debt burden.
Most people no longer care about brands and care more about features and price. There are many "others" phones that are more powerful than anything made by Apple or Samsung, but do not have the cachet. Your pie chart showed that at 4:09.
Good video but you missed the mark on a lot of points about japanese culture.
Really weird. They cut cost and sell their non safety DieHardSure (daihatsu) cars.They do tonnes of data falsification. I am sure this is one way of keeping them sustainable.
I really enjoyed this video, and it gave me new information about a topic, that i bare to know not nothing about! Is there any way, you could make videos like that about more different countries.  I feel like Germany could be interesting as well, with its rise of economy after the reunion (which still isnt done yet, really) and its stagnation and slow downfall pre and after covid, due to a government that reigned for 16 years with stability as its only feature, rather than investing into the future, voter pleasing behavior (which are mainly elder people 70+) and now a generation of politicians, that never learned anything but being a party pleasing politician. Its geopolitical reliability on its partners to be able to block of threats. Its inability of creating their own army due to amended Law 1955 (with Article 87a/b) Its problems with the age demographics (more elder than young people) Its way of inviting foreigners in, for taking jobs that Germans dont do, cause they dont get payed enough for it The unfounded fear of many, to lose their cultural identity due to immigrants.   The decisions of politicians, that have no insight in any job, as they never learned anything slowly ruining infrastructure as well as competitive advantages, due to over-regulation of building-applications, bureaucracy and more.  Would be very interesting to see a video about that of multiple countries.
Argentina is a discrace to humanity❤
USA: ❌ USI: ✅
why is it that "difficulty to raise the prices of domestic products in turn makes it harder for them to create goods that are going to compete globally"? what am i missing? thx!
Japan doesn’t want migrants since they don’t want to get replaced.
"Usually the best and brightest migrate from poorer countries" xDDD yea thats what we see right now in Europe, so many best and brightest engineers and doctors that are raping european woman
10000 JPY = 69 USD, not 200...
Working in a public IT company in Japan, I'm concerned about the country's trajectory. Policy decisions favor older demographics at the expense of the younger generation essential for future economic growth. Our IT sector lags behind the US, UK, Australia and China, limited by a localized focus on Japan's declining population. Encouraging young professionals to work here remains challenging due to language barriers, bureaucracy, a weakening yen, and low salaries compared to developed nations like Singapore, the UK, the US, and China. Nevertheless, Japan's unique culture and high quality of life keep me here, but I hope for a brighter economic future before I lose my patience and move to the US.
Did you forget that gaming and anime fans exist all over the world? Japan is growing economically faster than you realize. Also, Japan isn't stuck living in the year 2000. They're way ahead of their time and are beating America big time. And you call yourself OH SO WELL informed? Get a new hobby, bro.
Well Japan is a very different culture to europe, america or china. They do not strive economic growth on paper, they do strive wealth for low cost. They eliminated a lot of steps in the food supply, so far less money is either spent or made with food. Infact they made food so cheap that going out to eat is the norm. Many appartments are not meant to feed you at all. Their infrastructure has one of the highest adaption rates for technology in the world. Especially their trains have everything already in use that is still used in other countries to make a lot of money and work. So while the companies might look cheap on the stock market, the actually real assett of Toyota, Sony, Toyo, Yamaha etc. is gigantic. It's a highly efficient society with a focus on wealth, nor necessary growth and deffinetly not looking rich.
excellent very nice
wow this is a VERY pro-capitalist propaganda video.
Didn't touch on the very high suicide rate and how that relates to the economy in Japan.
Isn't a 10000 yen bill worth around 70$ not 200$?
Unskill people are overwhelming the US. US as a nation would be gone.
Japan will be at zero birth rate in 2043 so it really doesn’t matter economically about anything for everyone on the island because people are not having babies that’s the truth. Right now Japan’s birth rate is 1.340 that was in 2020. I would imagine it’s about 1.28 right now because it’s falling at a rate of .07 maybe more it’s going to accelerate too.
Most of their workforce are now robots
I love Kuznets. Thank you for you quote. From 🇧🇷. A Exploiting Amazon is necessary for economic growth! Kutznets and Mises are two of my favorites. ⚙️ Make it work.
Hey! I liked the year 2000! ;-)
japan still good and better now even compete with china is crazy ,how about europe thet still far to catchupjapan
Hypothetically speaking; If an entity hit 100% efficiency and stayed there, would economics refer to that as stagnation?
I wonder if/ what the relationship between high estate taxes and low birth rate might be?  ~this was interesting.  Thank you.
Got lost when you started talking about real estate, then started talking about German Cars in the next sentence. Productivity can not increase for ever, and neither can growth.  Really started tubthumping around the 16 minute mark - sounds like you are trying to convince people rather than provide your "balanced" information.
I have an more difficult question. Can Venezuela and Colombia be fixed?
8:40 Well, this is only true for countries like the USA and Canada though. Europe is experiencing migration that is at best neutral but more likely a net drain.
Our population will stop growing the moment we can eat food, recycle our waste, turn the waste into food, and ingest it again with no material losses.
The Japanese people are the reason the economy is sustaining. Everyone works even though they're old and beyond retirement age. And these people really love what they do.
living in 2000. Hm. Sounds good in 2024))))
completely no clues, just speculation from usa point of view
Wasn't this channel constantly shouting about how China's economy was about to explode any moment now?
Must try proving worth value & virtue beside promoting market cap as supposed representative along with affiliation as if those are "American" businesses much less self-sufficient, benign, moral, ... could say they characterize ScAmerika, intrude upon institutions, corrupt obstruct & violate process representation & protection, abuse harm & reckless while betray exploit harm & neglect "Americans", whatever that means either when denigrated to consumers & shills, definitely among despotism, disparity, conniving parasitic exploitation, systemic corruption, systematic injustice, kletptocrat & international corporateer profiteer graft been chisel heist harm & undeservedly indulged while perpetual reliant upon bailout propup & subsidize among grift & graft beside civil, criminal & human rights violations with atrocity happening but deceive, obfuscate, obstruct, & retaliate.

don't worry, they live in 2050
13:32 Japan real estate bubble was burst a few years before the Asian financial crisis.
14:37 can some1 explain this graph? Why are average monthly wages oscillating so much every year???
Just a bunch of liberal economic cliches. No real analytics.
And the US will do whatever it takes for Japan to remain that way.
You foget to mention that the Japanese economy was sabotaged
I didn't realize the inheritance tax was that high here. Going to have to make sure that significant chunks of my future wealth are invested abroad
The idea that economies should grow endlessly is cancer. Economists would have them completely destroy their culture for an arbitrary gdp figure.
Good
Yeaha Japan can fix it
Wow ❤❤❤ very nice video 👏👏👏
"expected to work 80 hours a week and live in a tiny room" ???? well if this isn't another inaccurate and racist summary of life in an Asian country from another conservative Australian yt male.  Maybe they care more about society and standard of living, rather than chasing money (which doesn't really exist) and digging up the planet faster and faster to produce more and more stuff we don't really need (="economic growth")
Japan is a safer country because it doesnt import diversity like the crime ridden USA and EU does.
My belief that zoning laws generally cause more harm than good is once again reinforced.
Krugman is the classic example of a broken clock being correct twice a day.
17:57 thats a dirty elephant 🐘 thrown on japan 😢, so covid was an attack on japan from china cause anime was getting popular and since recently they want to influence like usa 🇺🇸 did and saw the power of it they are aiming for that future… 😶  We need to update Culture and holidays Ppl , we are spiritually creatures something ppl will carried out doing instead of forgetting culture respect it all🫡,,
As a Japanese, I can detect many "non-Japanese" stock video clips, which may be Chinese or Korean ones. Understandably, you can't distinguish well for foreign people, like I can't distinguish British people from French people... or you can?
At about the eight minute mark you lost me. Supporting the great replacement (replacing the native population with third world foreigners) is a horrible idea. Those people are not a net bonus. They are a terrible drain.
Why are pop economicist so obsessive with GDP? Gross demestic product  says almost nothing about the countries economic health.
Economists are addicted to growth. Meanwhile you only need long term interest rates to reflect long term growth trend for a country to be stable.
Why is meta on that list? They literally contribute nothing of value to society.
Dont praise Paul Krugman ever again!!! Hahaha
The State Secrecy law thing is WAY over-egged. Especially disappointing, given that it was in service of an ad.
I'm a Canadian, specifically living in the bubble economy of Toronto.   Just came back from Japan, and it did truly feel like at least 2010s, and maybe even early 2000s in terms of prices of goods.  I was in Heaven, because everything felt so affordable!  Compare that to Toronto, where prices just go up for the sake of going up (housing, rent, electricity and gas rates, internet and cellphone rates, insurance, food, tip at restaurants...).  It made me feel like Canadian/American companies are all just greedy and jacking prices compared to Japan.
Thing is, Japan is increasing productivity - GDP per worker has been increasing quite well in recent decades - but as total number of workers goes down due to aging, overall GDP doesn't move much either way.  Considering the amount of people most nations facing similiar problems would need to import to alleviate it, there's a very good argument to be made for going the Japaneese route - after all, you'd be essentially colonising your own country with foreigners otherwise, which is a major issue - migrants won't integrate if there's nothing to integrate into.
Whatever happens to Japan its citizens will continue to be Japanese. Japan does not have open borders massive unending immigration and globalist elite leaders erasing and replacing their population. My money is on Japan.
I was just in Japan for three weeks in around Tokyo and Nagoya, and if it wasn't for the language barrier (which admittedly I could learn if I had the dedication to actually study, which I'm too lazy to do, to be honest) I would much prefer living there over the US. I mean, you can still get around just fine without knowing any Japanese, especially in larger cities like Tokyo, but the people of Japan are very polite and by speaking to them in their language, even if they understand English and you don't speak Japanese well, they will genuinely appreciate your effort to do so and help you.
its absolutely disgusting to hear so many people suggest the japanese should commit self genocide just to make number go up a little  there is no such thing as skilled migration there is only suicide after seeing america and europe crumble, its disgusting you still have the lack of morals to make a suggestion like that
If someone can reset all Japanese now, may be they can start living in 2050 now and then stay in 2050 in the whole 22th century.
Seems it’s more a stable economy then a stagnant one no economy can grow forever the goal is to get a stable economy
1:43 "Does this mean that limitless growth could be possible in our own economies?" Funniest thing I've heard all day. Thanks, I needed the laugh.
are you perun?
Interesting video. One thing you didn't mention when concerning houses in Japan is the deprecation of value for houses in Japan. Houses in Japan aren't built to last for centuries. At best they're built for one or two generations. This due to the constant earthquakes the country suffers through (making areas which are more susceptible to earthquakes more likely to have houses deprecate in strength and thus value), and on the other side the constant stricter housing laws to ensure houses can resist earthquakes. These stricter laws ensure that houses built before the 2000s are considered worthless. Or worse, have a negative value (due to the cost of demolishing the house and removing all stuff inside the house). This leads to the (in)famous reality Japan has of mass abandoned hosues. If you inherit such an "old" house from your parents, it is "cheaper" to just leave the house abandoned rather than trying to renovate or even sell it. In big cities like Tokyo, those hosues would find an easy buyer due to the value of the ground. In small villages, that ground has little value due to having little to no interested buyers. Yes, a LOT of those abandoned houses still belong to someone. It's just cheaper to leave it abandoned rather than bother doing anything with it.
perpetual growth is a childish concept in theory, and in practice it is a disease called cancer. Stagnation is not popular but it is safe and can endure, growth is not.
Nothing but upsides, yeah who needs kids, just get immigration /s
I’m wondering about the Japanese reluctance to taken on debt, a factor that turbo charged western economies once easy credit and loans became widely available to consumers from the 1970’s onwards, such as credit cards. Also, most Japanese are cash positive, with a good amount of savings, compared to major western economies where debt is higher reducing or removing the opportunity for savings.
what a massive cope piece argentina failed everytime bc of socialism japan stagnates bc of socialism end of story learn your history
looks like japan is doing just fine...
10000Y is worth 69USD according to XE. Not 200. Bit misleading.
this is dumb
I'll take Japan's numbers any day.   Spending my whole life in and around San Francisco - probably the ultimate boom/bust city - a modicum of stability would come in real handy right now.   (SF is much closer to the beginning of this current bust cycle than its end, and I do not expect it to fully recover in this decade, and perhaps not in what's left of my lifetime.)
Great video!
Can anyone explain why almost all of the graphs shown here on Japan's economy look like sinus waves? Especially this one @14:36
What do the effects of the Plaza Accords have on the economic situation?
Close mindedness is one of biggest reason for stagnation. It’s similar story as Nokia. Many are praising how Japan is already very advanced. No one is denying but ultimately with time they will become irrelevant and other countries will take over. Not saying they will become poor country but they might be surpassed by many other countries.
Bro seriously said standard of living is not high 😹
Nobody ever mentions that during the Reagan the US era forced Japan to waste its vast surplus in (bad) American investments (including US treasuries).   At the same time Japan had to hand over many of its key patents in the information and technology sector which evaporated their lead in this sector at a stroke.  The American Dotcom bubble wouldn't have happened with Japan slicing its own belly on Washington's orders a decade earlier.
No
You should mention why Japan didn't manage to surpass the American economy back in the late 80s and 90s in the beginning of your video.. banning Japanese products and increase yen by force by America.. come on..
There are regulations with land usage and you can't just build a tower where a house used to be. Every plot of land is associated with two ratios :   Land Occupancy Ratio: This refers to the percentage of the land that can be built upon in relation to the total land area. In Tokyo and other cities facing space constraints, regulations govern how much of a plot can be occupied by buildings. For instance, if the land occupancy ratio is 60%, it means that only 60% of the land can be covered by structures, while the remaining 40% must be left as open space, including setbacks, gardens, and driveways.  Floor Area Ratio (FAR) or Floor Space Index (FSI): This ratio represents the total floor area of the building(s) relative to the size of the land. For example, if the FAR is 300%, it means that the total floor area of the building(s) can be up to three times the size of the land. This can allow for taller buildings or more extensive structures on relatively smaller plots of land, allowing for more efficient use of space, especially in densely populated urban areas like Tokyo.  Quite common to have 60% / 150% in Tokyo.
1st.. They have to throw their sh**ty pride by acknowledge that no country is above others. 2nd..  Delete or reduce the pension's fee 3rd..  Change the work culture.
Japan is fine and culturally is more rooted. Western Influenced has affevetd countries like kore. They manage crises better and come together when catastrophe natural or otherwise strike. So,this whole idea of economy based on monetary and gdp is superficial
0:09 Thanks to USA for making this happen. Plaza Accord.
a society not run by Wall Street and quarterly growth mania?  Maybe Japan is showing the way to the future.
Japan’s population is not that much smaller than Russia’s, 125M to 145M, it is tiny compared to Russia, has no extractive industries, yet look how much better off they Japanese are compared to the Russians.  Russia must be humiliated!
Why is every clipart person in the graphics (7:55) white, despite moving away from non-white countries?
Plaza accord?
No reason that the Japanese people are against immigration is because of racism😊
I would rather live in a country with a stagnant economy than a rotting rootless culture.
Maybe perpetual growth isn’t something to shoot for… just a thought
I think Japan is smarter than the west and will not import mass third world migrants. And thank god for that. They're actually proud of their culture here, unlike in the west where the native populations are brainwashed from birth that they're bad, evil oppressors and deserve to be replaced. I live here and speak the language, so that's just my impression from speaking with people on a daily basis.
Correct on many levels but very wrong on others.  This is the issue with random channels / so-called "experts" making videos about this, that and everything to build content.  Now people will watch this and think everything said is correct.  Japan (like all countries) is very complex and if you really want to know "why" Japan has stagnated it would take a series of videos plus the inclusion of Japan and or Foreigner economic experts who have lived in Japan a long time.
Great video, spot on actually, except glorifying Krugman. The man is a quack who missed the Internet (stating it would have as much economic impact as the fax machine) and continues to miss the relevance of Bitcoin, just as Black Rock et al are launching ETFs.
Is really immigration the solution? are really advanced countries bringing in the best workers? Mmmm ... it clearly doesn't seem so, quite the contrary, criminals, unassimilable people. And that has created lots of chaos in advanced economies.
Thank god for CC, can hardly understand every 3rd word. Please stop the mumbling and intermittent super fast talking.
Video's TLDR: maybe Japan should accept a bunch of immigrants creating mayhem in their streets so that they can boost their GDP a few basis points?
지진과 화산재앙 때문에 일본에서 사는 건 늘 불안할 것 같음
What are you saying something weird is happening in Japan? Come to the Philippines and we’ll show you weird will all our poverty and politicians.
Migrants have benefits but like some has already mentioned in the comments - its not the entire picture. Too many migrants will do the same thing as too high of a birth rate: We lived thru such time during the 80s. High unemployment - hence why our parents freaks out when we change jobs. Migrants adds pressure into institutions and infrastructures NOW while birth rates takes around 20-25 years. Japan has also land challenges.  Ultimately, the numbers game isnt some secret hack that is unlimited and without cons. What hurt japans the most is mostly losing industries. While a country needs vibrant youth for many reasons - Japan's priority is the same priority as most nations are - Stability, culture, traditions.
This work force participation vs unemployment rate statistic really worries me. I think macro economic logic is being used to undermine welfare policy when it comes to political discourse and economic policy.
Excellent video chock full of interesting insights. If I could share one bit of feedback on the production, it would be to SLOW...DOWN! I know we can adjust the playback speed, but for dense information like this, I would suggest a bit of a slower paced delivery, just a bit more pauses to separate thoughts
Right now it’s actually super easy for well educated Chinese to work in Japan. A Chinese with a good degree in the right sector could get Japanese green card in a year. The problem is that Japanese wages in tech sector isn’t even competitive compared to similar post in Chinese mega cities. Why move to Japan when you can get similar wage in another Chinese city😂
immigration isnt as much of a panacea as you think due to the high percentage of their income going to overseas remittances and not back into the economy
Cost of living in the US has been skyrocketing while wages have stagnated since the 80s so the US isn't some utopia.
Its what happens when you replace something organic with something inorganic.  Japan losts it's spirituality.. self identity and self worth.. ts sense of self and replaced by working mindlessly.  Spirituality is dead in Japan.. and its people has no where to turn to for moral, emotional,  and spiritual support.
I think looking at the Great Lakes economy would be and interesting video, considering the great leakes region has the largest gdp in world behind the USA and China.
Japanese are super serious people no one comes close to them maybe nazis 😂😂😂 but it's destroying them from with in like everyone else times  10x
Analysis made by the World Bank -one of the worst fraudsters on modern times, yes I take legit everything this demons day.
Are you not the guy talking about the advantage of owning a modern apartment who would bring you no income, in comparison to a medieval castle kind of the Versailles palace and its domains, who supposed to be "bad" because people in the feudal times would get ill from eating "unvaccinated" animals? (to be honest I did eat just like that for all my childhood since our communist regime at the time would not dare to force ppl what to grow at home and to meddle into their farms -the modern society still call that old communist regime "tyrannical", but still this is not the subject of today)?  How can people be so naive and still listen to your "expertise"?  hint: if I'd own a sh1tty apartment like yours and someone would offer me in exchange a medieval, well kept castle, and its domains, I'd accept the deal in a second
Wow, this was an unfocused, superficial mess.
Sourcing Krugman with anything besides mockery makes me extremely wary of the rest of the video.
A lot of things that happen to me seems more like man made things rather than god or bible prophecy like does god really just wait until a new year an then boom some tragedy happens or is this is controlled stuff
Hey, when is China's economy collapsing? Was it six months ago? Or is it next month?
it’s the curses by Geto
You can have continued exponential growth OR you can settle down and enjoy prosperity once the fundamentals have been achieved.  You can't have both at the same time.  Plus Japan is fervently all one race.  They know diversity is a path to reduction or possibly destruction.  Are they bigots or wise people?
Robots will solve a lot of Japans labour issues. We are not too many years away from a fully functional autonomous system
It's Japan, everything is weird
If I understand their situation correctly…… shrinking population is their most serious problem
And the Plaza Accord ?
well, its hard to see growth when Godzilla shows up every other year and destroys everything - and you have to spend all you funds on rebuilding....   its gotta suck.
Economies must eventually reach a point of maturity beyond which they can't grow further.  The economic output of each person is limited and some, more limited than others,   Some lack the ability or desire to be top producers or earners.
USAY
Japan has sky high real inflation right now. I live here and what most people don't seem to understand is that while prices don't appear to be rising, it is actually SHRINKflation that is happening. Package contents for everything are getting ever smaller. What used to contain 70g for example now contains 50g. But the price is the same as it was, so most people don't notice the 40% real inflation.... Any business trying to maintain pricing AND quantity/quality is finding it impossible to do.
Do you breath while talking?
You know what. I wish Europe had made the same economic "mistakes" as Japan.
Japan are kind of lucky in one respect. Mass immigration is slowly destroying the social and cultural fabric of Europe, especially since most of these immigrants come from the third world and make no effort to integrate into the nations they end up in.  Japan dodged a bullet when it comes to that sad outcome
Your comment on the housing isn’t quite true. Tokyo is full of tiny low cost apartments with no amenities, but anywhere outside of Tokyo has lots of large living space and affordable homes. I don’t even mean countryside. There are tons of great cities in Japan to live in.
US is a 3rd world country, financially and socially. On paper US looks goods, but in reality it's bankrupt and socially, a disaster. Comparing US to Japan does not make sense.
GDP per capita is what counts, not total GDP. Not sure what economics school you studied at.
I feel like to make the population and economies stable you need to keep poor countries poor… that sounds bad to be honest… 7:55
More people doesn't mean a better economy for people. It means higher cosy of living and over pressured infrastructure.
You’re welcome mate, bye 🙂
That's why Japan is smart. We peaked as society were Japan stopped evolving, they forever live in the 90s and I LOVE that and wish the world was like that.
US killed the japanese thriving economy in 80s with the plaza accord.. its been stagnating ever since
I just wanted to take a moment to say how amazing your video was! I was really impressed with the quality of the footage, the editing, and the overall presentation. You did a great job of explaining the topic in a clear and concise way, and I learned a lot from watching your video.  I also really appreciated the way you made the video engaging and entertaining. You kept my attention throughout the entire video, and I never felt bored or lost. I would definitely recommend your video to anyone who is interested in learning more about the video.
If the USA stopped giving them free cash and incentives they would be nothing
hentai
You did not mention the tradewar between US, Americans have compressed the Japanese technology advancement in different ways, also the currency rate. These are the true underlying reasons.
Japan's stagnation happened because of Keynesian economics, they kept spending billions on zombie corporations instead of just letting them fail. This video really misses forest for the trees, but that's because this channel also follows the retarded idea that is Keynesian economics, basically just Marxist economics but updated for the modern world.
Boomers are the worst generation ever.
Been in Japan for more than 20 years now. The Japanese economy has stagnated not due to economic factors, but due to myopic policies created during the boom years. Japan never cared about spreading companies throughout the country, so they let Tokyo consolidate a full 25% of the country in a single city.  In order to accommodate all the new workers, they built cheap, simply furnished, small apartments in abundance but very few aspirational housing good for raising a family. And despite the baby boom having been off for decades now and it being clear that workers need improvements in quality of life to better raise families in the modern economic situation, there's been no changes in national policies to spread the population outside of Tokyo, to encourage real estate companies to build more housing good for family with a good step-up system for people selling small places and move into larger spaces, and work to reduce executive payouts/corporate financing shenanigans in order to ensure workers have money to buy products and pay for housing.  Instead the government is stepping up use of AI, machine learning (several government websites are now auto-translated), and other such "we don't need human workers" policies.
Everyone is approaching Japan. Well good luck ... there ll be more accidents out a window
Ecommunists Explained still doesn't equal savings with investments(especially with savings stored in banks - which most of them are). Very telling for "economists" that equal money printing to growth and consider inflation a positive thing
No, its going to be a flaming mess in a decade. If this video is still up in ten years somebody remind me to post a follow up comment
i dont see japanese people saying housing is affordable, they often say its too dear and cant afford it and so have to live in a shoe box.
Japan will not recover unless its birthrate dramatically increases or they begin mass immigration. Otherwise the population will shrink over this century, as will its economy.
The US has the highest GDP and is an absolute hellscape in a majority of major metropolitan cities across the nation… Japan is clean, futuristic, affordable, and the people are some of the friendliest I’ve ever encountered… who cares about GDP if that’s the end result
I'd like to thank Japan for One Piece, Pokemon, and Nintendo.
Japans model for society is the only way we can ensure our futures without huge calmities and conflict. I.e. balence.
Meh, nothing but a propaganda of a Chinese Communist Party. Economics Explained is pretty sure a CCP shill. :P
Would love to show this to my former colleagues in Japan leading businesses there.  I'm one of those workers that left Japan for better opportunities abroad. It's especially harder for women and young people to work in Japan given its very outdated biases toward its workers and roles of certain demographics of people. I always joke to comment about my visits to Japan as not a visit to another country, but to another planet.
Do you want to live in somewhere else in the world? It seems that it is dangerous to live in Japan, especially because it has earthquakes and tsunami!
Easy... japan issues japanese currency...that is their secret
To all of those of you talking about how the aging population is going to crush Japan, friendly reminder that robots that will be capable of caring for the elderly will be arriving probably much sooner than you think.

Yeah we did it twice, I think we can fix it again
thumbnail be like "you are my specialz"
Totally misleading clickbait bullshit..
Economic growth is linked with carbon emissions. A stagnant and prosper economy is great for the environment.
Just one thought...Interest rates in Japan are at 3.5% currently
Why does GDP even matter if people are better off
I'm afraid your comment is quite different from current Japanese inheritance tax law.  The ones who are supposed to pay the Japanese inheritance tax is only top １０％　 rich of the Japanese  population. Because there are reductions. Along with basic reductions . For example if you have a house for living the reduction is 80% of the value of the house. Then consequently most of ordinary Japanese do not have to pay inheritance tax.
femboys happened tbh  nothing more
Very like
Japan achieved its ultimate goal in a very short amount of time, now they need a new purpose, a sense of purpose that could propel the human kind to another level. I hope this nation could lead other nations one day to that dream, because i sensed that the Japanese people have dreamt the same dream, it is now to take action. Go Japan.
JAPAN STILL HAS BEST QUALITY OF LIFE.
Even the Roman empire collapsed. No empire will last forever.
A 10000 yen note is NOT worth about $200.  It is worth about $80.  Please post a correction.
90% of most claimed growth is likely just inflation. Just like the stock market.
Why such a claickbaity non-descript title? The video leaps straight a monologue without so much as a brief outline of the topic or structure in the first minute of this 20 min long video
What is this USI country he's been talking about?
Nothing weird is happening in Japan EVER! OKAY!? False claim.
The only way immigration works is if you force them to integrate.  They must learn the language and must not make demands from their own cultures.  The example of this being needed is the rest of the West.
Are you just finding out about tentacle Porn?
So gdp is just made up mumbo jumbo. okay. noted
The one thing I know about the japanese is that they are very tired of working so much, and making so little.
Horrible things have happened in Japan.  Most likely false flags and weather weapons have been used.  There are evil and powerful people who hate the great nation that is the Land of the Rising Sun.
Way too long. Got bored listening to you waffle on. Now I'll never know what's happening in Japan.
Author did not mention difficulties with Japanese terrain. Mountains occupies most of theses Islands, making any construction of any industry or agriculture difficult. So even if Japaneese would decide to grow their industries, they will struggle with space/ Not a big deal to find space in USA or Russia
Simple answer:  No.  Demographic death spiral.
huh. Arabic is the second most commonly spoken second language, who'd a thunk it?
spot on, well said
Dosen't sound bad ss it is.
Krugman is awful. The Nikkei bubble war banking system. Princes of the Yen by Richard Werner. Similar to what is going on here. Credit creation for asset purchases and consumption is unsustainable and leads to inflation. When it burst, the central planners left them in a severe recession for 20 years until they caved in and got what they wanted.
I miss the days in the early 2000's when everyone dreams and await the next Sony phone model which were amazing.  Now, they are outdated, overpriced and just a phone version of their DSLR cameras.  The only saving grace for Sony is PlayStation and their Bravia 4K TV's....   Also, think a lot before migrating in Japan. Locals love tourists in their cities but when living there for a long time, they despised it.
The YT channel Dividend Growth copied your exact video posted just two days ago titled "Something Weird Is Happening In Japan". They copied it word for word
I lived in Japan for years and was worried going this video would misrepresent the issues in Japan in a way I've seen many times before, or leave things out. But no, you hit everything. Super awesome breakdown. Thanks for providing this crucial information to your audience!
this channel used to be better.  the stock footage is just too cringe.  please consider our eyes and brains alike * insert picture of eye-brain
great video! the ideas were clearly conveyed, and well thought out. the video itself well edited, and quite concise! i ask as a fan and citizen of this country; could you do a video on canada's economy?
Banging Japanese chicks 😊
I’m Italian and I think Italy is not that far as a comparison:  We have had an economic boom in the 80s, then flatlined. Today, even if our economy is surely not regarded as a strong one and our GDP is pretty low , our standards of life is above average…  No one ends up homeless. Yeah, we complain about salary but we all go for our little “aperitivo” in the evening. During summer no one is in the city but everyone is on a beach , lake or mountain. If rather be a poor in Italy than a lower-middle class in the US
Not sure why I saw an ad for hillsdale college on this video….
I really enjoyed traveling in Japan. Such a peaceful country and people.
Who would be ever surprised their economy is never failing despite the many reasons someone would have predicted so? If you have known some things about Japanese culture and how insanely devoted they are to education and work (and I don't mean "insanely" in a positive way, it's actual trash) you'd clearly understand that they will simply never fail no matter what.
Yeah, I'm *sure* we are getting every 3rd world country's finest doctors and engineers to come work for us... Give me a break.
Japan is not broken. They are not just a country of mere numbers. They are a country of people with very good human values. They will be just fine
I clicked thinking the culling games started
You post this vid and Niigata instantly got wrecked by an earthquake :(
Really can't wait for you guys to make a video on Nigeria!
I just couldn't keep up with the Chinese office animations being passed as Japanese, the overall bootlicking of North Atlantic models and irregular incomplete information.
This might blow your mind. How about Japan has handled the pandemic in a reasonable way and not handicapped their workforce and now it's getting ahead of everyone else that let a bioweapon infect the population.
Or it could be like Canada where we attract poor unskilled migrants, house them, give them cash to move here, and give them free medical care. Are you asking your self how does that help Canada's gdp. Lol it doesn't.
The main factor Japanese housing is cheap compared to other advanced countries is because they don't invite a million or more third worlders every year competing for the same housing.
The labour force doubling equals 2x the GDP is insanely incorrect. If thats true it assumes that ALL of the companies in the country are unscaled and work at half of their potential, while MOST companies are already scaled to plateu, which means, more labour fprce wouldnt make a lot of difference
0:28 The problem in argentina is the predominant culture and values. As happens with almost every country in south america.
Add Brazil to the "Argentina" type economy. Same thing. It's said Brazil is the country of the future. It's been like that for decades. Forever looking to a hypothetical future without doing anything in the present.
Something Weird Is Happening In Japan. Japan is the new Austin.
It seems that in order to boost their economy Japan needs to have mayor cultural changes: inclusive inmigration, more families, working schedules, etc.
Immigration should be illegal brain drain is the least of the issues the destruction of the culture and social structure is far worse
hurrr durrr 🤤 GDP number go up...good
Typical delusional Americans never go outside of their house 😂😂
I rather be poor in Japan than always living in a shooting range 😂😂. Japan well done about strictly immigrant policies. These American will never understand cuz they never been a non-big city in Japan or know japanese
The inheritance thing is not the problem. What they do is they just transfer assets/ wealth to their children years before they pass away. This way the actual inheritance tax is small
@13:34. Japan bubble burst in the early 90’s, was not a result of the Asian Financial crisis which happened in 1997.
If Paul Krugman is the most influential economist in the world, that is a big, big problem. Economists in general are pretty much a force of extreme evil in societies, because they use "science" to justify the absolute destruction of the culture of a place. Japan has resisted this, whereas the USA and Europe are becoming the third world they are inviting in. In the long run, Japan (and China, which also has limited immigration) will win.
India enters chat with 1.4billion peoples and expected to grow well in upcoming years
Japan foremost values stability and long term planning.  Period. If you chase short term goals and current trends, you lose that stability and social trust eventually because people lose assurance that their money will remain valuable.
Perhaps Japan's problem is a lack of real sovereignty?
The new Amish
You left out the MOST CRITICAL Facts that caused Japan to stagnate. THE PLAZA ACCORD decimated Japan. US arrested Toshiba's executives the same dirty playbook US used to try kill Huawei (but failed miserably) and killed Alsthom ( thus gobbled up by GE). This dude is either dumb or stupid to miss those most important facts.
Stopped watching after "Japan's high living standards". Dude, they've living in the smallest apartments on average and even has no centralized heating.
Tad off on the YEN to USD mate✌
lack of the testosterone levels present in the era of their parents
You ain't talk about their debt
I love how you judge the world and japan on such an American point of view 🪟 😂. No mention on their leadership on robotization and AI coming. No mention that Japan has a quite significant higher birthrate than South Korea, Italy or Spain to name a few. No mention that in the long-term no inflation goes a long way to an economy. And forgot to mention that a bad immigration is worst that no or little immigration. 🎉😂 Japan 🗾 all the way! Silently, slowly, steadily and against "all Western" odds.
6:00  An interesting case to study is that in a Nordic state, Finland I think, the women on the work force went on strike… and nobody noticed…
"Thanks for watching mate!"  Meanwhile I'm a woman 😀
Japan has a rather high technological adaptation. They have the best railways, intercity transportation and generally, Japanese electronics have been at the forefront of innovation. Not to mention their devices are better and longer lasting than most produced anywhere else. Perhaps, it may be some sort of technological advancement like state of the art microchips that has kept them where they are.
The limitations put on Japanese exports since the late 80s and early 90s is what is behind Japan's relative decline since then.
It is well known that if you work 40 hours a week and then you suddently work 80 hours a week, you are exactly twice as productive as before
You say Japan has an economy, U.S, China, Argentina, each have an economy, sure, in theory they would, but with the internet the distinction between economies is impossible to determine, it's one vast supranational mess of economics, and that is dangerous in terms of world peace and democracy.  If nations share an economy they can lose the ability to fund their independence, and when a nation isn't independent they will blame other nations for their problems, ergo war.  Adam Smith said global wealth never increases, it adapts to supply and demand, meaning if you flood the market the value of the product drops, nations selling low reduces their national wealth, or their ability to sustain it long term.  The theory is, if you prevent your national wealth bleeding out faster than your population generates wealth your nation will become richer, that doesn't mean your population will become richer, there's still the matter of if that wealth is reasonably distributed or concentrated in a few, but that's a matter for the system you are using.  Japan is a unitary monarchy with 125+ million people, that's out of four main options, unitary monarchy, unitary republic, federal monarchy and federal republic, the advantage of a unitary system is Despotism: basically a singular government has supreme power, that doesn't mean it's bad or oppressive, but it could be.  Easy to get side tracked, but long story short, Japan has a massive population, that's potentially dangerous in a single authority, becoming a federal monarchy would subdivide national power between state authorities, so long as there are five or more relatively equal states in the union, the balance of power ought to cycle each state into democracy safely, and maintain it so long as the balance of power exists.  Japan doesn't need to be the strongest economy in the world, it only needs to be more protective of the wealth it produces, and distribute it fairly.
I'm not educated in this topic but GDP as shown at 4:50 seems like a stupid metric. Surely the amount of time worked is meaningless if not multiplied by the rate of work? Or is the rate of work normally assumed to be constant for some (good) reason?
How silly every world based its economy on growth, you can't have infinite people on this planet. At least Japan has owned shrinking, same with South Korea, it would kill Australia. Luckily our wise Government just imports more people to fix the low birth rate.
GDP IS OVERRATED...
tokyo has affordable housing...??
I think there's a typo in your graphic about labor utilization rates. Shouldn't it be Working age - Institutionalized (not Non-institutionalized) in the denominator?
ofc Japan can be Fix ! just not this decade 😢
Japan stop progressing since US containment Japan was forced to sign Plaza Accord that caused Japan to go downhill since then. China has learn from Japan and wont let US to contain them. Thials video are purposely misleading and does not addresa the main cause😢
It's worth remembering how Japan's manufacturing was outcompeting US in the 70s, leading it to a new wave of anti-Japan reaction (not unlike the anti-China reaction now.) You can still find memorable videos of Americans smashing Japanese products. The US was waging war through media propaganda, endless economic tariffs and finally the Plaza Accords 1985- which led USDJPY tumbling down from 400 to almost 150.   The nearly tripled exchange value of yen made the entire Japanese exports much less competitive. The Plaza Accord also encouraged banks to lend enormous amounts of money in the housing sector, planting the seeds to the real estate and stock market bubbles popping in the 90s. With a crippled economy, Japan was left to bleed to its death as capital responded by moving their manufacturing to US and other countries like China.
Tokyo doesn't have problems about housing because the city is completely devasted. There's almost no trees or environment in the city.
Japan requires a college education for even menial jobs. It's a stopgap for foreigners coming in and working even minimum wage jobs. Even knowing the language isn't good enough to get sponsorship for a work visa on its own.
Yes but they needs to first start having kids !! Cause they are worse in population decrease
Fair video.... except for the part where you claim the U.S. picks and chooses only the highly educated for entry.  Maybe you were thinking of Canada?
Slow and steady wins the race :)
I lived in Japan.  Their goal isn't growth, it's a stable society that benefits all.
Japan is ahead of its time in everything. That’s what happens when your general population have IQ’s on average 10 points higher than those of the most intelligent populations of the world.
Wow, your research is trash...
'Stagnation', or 'Stabilization'? I think the first takeaway from Japan is that a stable economy doesn't necessarily mean one that grows endlessly but one that can maintain and sustain itself at the same level over time.
the USAYE
What are these video titles.
Japans debt to gdp is THE HIGHEST in the world. NO WAY OUT. Just Maths.  DOOMED. Fiscally  AND DEMOGRAPHICALLY.
"Japan living in 2000s since 1970s" yea lol
My takeaway from this video, is that low immigration and looser land zoning rules helps create affordable housing. But these observations likely wouldn't translate to Australia
Pushing migration on japan is not only stupid it’s unethical
the Cult of Eternal Growth  what has that turned America and it's European satellites into?
Japan doesn't have the size or resource to be super power like USA or China. However, Japanese people are extremely disciplined and hardworking and can punch way above what its capable of.
Idk where you're getting that Tokyo has affordable or cheap housing. That's not at all the case. Housing there is very expensive and the only way you can live there is by making a lot of money and/or having your company pay a significant portion of your housing bill (which is common). Also, most apartments (apaato's) in Tokyo are small, sometimes very small.
My wife is Japanese. I work remotely in the US and make about 90man/month take home. We decided to get a next to nothing home in Japan and live the simple life. Only problem is I stand out like a sore thumb but atleast the internet is fast. BTW everything mentioned in this video is accurate.
Honestly stagnation should be the end goal of every economic model. Stability is all that matters
Argentina - ‘the country that never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity’
*Nintendo punches EE in the face*
The big problem with a rapidly expanding economy is that it brings massive inflation and if not kept in check by government control, basically prices the next generation out of being in a stable enough situation to settle down and have kids. Much fewer children means a greying population and eventually a shrinking population as they die off, with the economy slowly grinding to halt as a result. It just turned out that Japan's economy reached its limit/break-even point in the mid-1990s and the cyberpunk speculative futures of Japan ruling the world through increasing economic and technological strength from the 1980s predicting that "the graph always goes up" turned out to be wrong.
you didnt mention why tokyo is housing is so affordable, almost 50% is unoccupied apartments the only reason this has dropped recent years was the major tsunami & earthquake forcing people to move.
does xenophobia have a cause also? knowing how japan kinda historically doesn't like outsiders even half japanese kids get called foreigners that are born there.
And how many employees in the West have been sacked (I'm thinking Banks) to help the bottom line for shareholders only for the share price to be wiped out in the next market crash which makes no sense to me.
As long as japan retains a high gdp per capita and high standard of living who cares about gross gdp.
Growth is not quality of life.
Looking at the social issues in the West, the Japanese are doing something right. Screw your GDP, if the price is 'diversity' and 'open-air toilets' in the street
writing everything on paper is costing the japanese economy a fortune
Your outlook on China in this video i add far far too rosy.
No china's economy is not doing better than Japan. Every single statistic or graph that comes out of china needs to be under heavy scrutiny. They fake everything to seem better than they actually are. They paint stuff green in order to make it look like their country is thriving. They also attach rocks the rebar in order to make it seem like fresh crops have just been planted from above.
Well I think Japan just needs to find a small country in the Middle East with a lot of oil and go in there to give them democracy and freedom so they can get back up just like America 🤣
Japan is an US ally, China is not. I think we'll start seeing more "Made in Japan", again,  in the coming years.
Working in Japan has traditionally been a total nightmare compared to other developed countries. Maybe that will change?
Paul Krugman is a moron
Japan is doomed for sure. Major industries of Japan are shrinking, including auto industry (challenged by EV), semi-conductor industry, consumer electronics, etc. Many majoy issues lie in Japan's economy and I don't see an easy fix coming soon.
The plaza accords
As a Japan nerd who is interested both in its history and its current social issues, this was interesting.
A conservative government shows how thick it's skin is by banning people from criticizing it.  That makes sense, and like normally it stagnates competition in the one field that needs it the most: elected leaders.
Japan is mostly reclaimed land. Japan is doomed with whats coming.
No, "advanced" economies DON'T reap nothing but benefits from the vaunted "migration/diversity" incessantly touted by WORTHLESS neokeynesian sophists that look upon "the masses" as pieces on a gameboard.  If that was the case, the Roman Empire of the West would still be around with direct continuity to the 5th Century AD.  What ailes Japan and other countries is debt-backed currencies lent into existence at the expense of the People.  Japan, the US, and all other nations need sound money that can't be counterfeited for the benefit of ruling-class parasites.
Although birth rates are dropping in most, if not all, developed nations, Japan is unique in that a third of all single adults have never had a single date in their lives, according to a recent news report. Those who do date typically do so in groups of men with groups of women in which no pairing off takes place. Thus, the birth rate is doomed to drop even more precipitously in the decades to come as this social isolation becomes more entrenched.
japan is losing it’s auto industry… it’s unable to convert to EV successfully and are stuck in old ways…. similar to german cars and gm ford
I already know this is going to be full of rubbish.  "Japan had underlying issues"... more like the IMF destroyed their economy because they were set to outpace the U.S.
Still a better country than Australia
Using the GDP figure alone is misleading.  For example, a woman caring for elderly parents may not earn enough to cover the cost of adult daycare.  The aged parent may catch an infection at the day care which leads to pneumonia, with hospital costs wiping out all gains to the government's spending power with taxes.  Immigrants, unless very carefully chosen may cost more than they earn unless they have private insurance for both disability and medical.  When immigrants have children, they may have difficulties and end up in low level jobs or engage in crime or become alcoholics, costing more in social welfare costs than they generate.  I would advocate admitting immigrants who come with enough money to start small businesses to revitalise the countryside.  Japan needs to hire workforce coaches to help people decide which activities are productive and replace those which aren't with productive ones, and end work earlier so men can interact with children or elderly parents. Having more part-time job schedules with part-time day care available would get mothers in the work force without the corresponding household expenditures on convenience foods which greatly cut into family expenses.
Maybe they should quit being xenophobic and accept that they either need to let in foreign workers or crumble. It’s an either or situation.
So Japan bad because late stage Capitalism, got it.
Japan is setting the stage to show how a country downsizes in population without failing.  My hats off to that country.  I'm a big fan of their culture, engineering and sciences.  They are pretty xenophobic (there is history behind that) but it may be one reason they are succeeding.
What about all the unproductive immigration?
This is a lie. Japan is in the future matter of fact, they're far in the future. They're just smart with their money, products and exposing their secrets. But their freedom, rights, laws, and labor are horrible
US AAAIII
I hope Japan will never relax its immigration policies. Europe is suffering from the consequences of mass immigration and Japan should not follow in their footsteps.
Very good video. Thank you.
So Japan decided our workers are too productive and we don't like that there are so many old companies, lets take more than half of everything anytime someone dies and completely deincentivise saving or investing.
Dude Japan has been in hyperinflation years before the United states
There is no fix to Japan they culture is very racist and they do not mix with others, from one POV it is good to preserve their culture, if we look at what is happening in Europe, in the other site, they simply prefer to be extinct instead of mixing with other cultures like Americans… by 2030 the number of old Japanese will be really stunning…
US economic growth is closely tied to population growth. Japan’s population is shrinking.
The real issue in Japan is demographics. People live up to a century, 1.34 births per woman.
paul krugman ok, i leave now
Video:Something Weird Is Happening In Japan Channel:Dividend Growth  A day ago someone edited your video by keeping the title and shortening the discussion.
Don't fix what is not broken. Japan will rebound when old makes room for young. It is extremely heavily overpopulated and thus requires a lot of its population to drop off to a healthy point. Immigration would completely destroy Japan forever like it has done for the west. Japan needs to import most of its food.
Japans model works for Japan, but that also sums up the major problem. It's a country built by artisans, taught to carry on tradition and work for society rather than find their own way. Even outside of artisanal work, this view has leaked out and ingrained itself into the national psyche. There is a lack of people willing to take risk and make change, there is a lack of innovation.   You will notice as well that in fields which have a high emphasis on innovative such as science and medicine, Japan actually contributes a great effort for themselves and the rest of the world. When they are put into an environment that breeds innovators, they do very well, they are a meticulous and smart people.   Hopefully the younger generation can realise the countries gross potential.
It was the US that clipped the wings of Japan…. They were not allowed to create global OS even though they were Head in early 80s. You missed that. Now they are doing the same thing to Germany
I’d like it how you bring up housing affordability meanwhile, for the past couple of years there has been an increasing population of homelessness in Japan. It is definitely a different form of homelessness than in America, but still nonetheless.
🌻
Something weird is happening in Japan?  STOP THE PRESS!
I wanted to share my experience as maybe it can help. I am an Australian who has recently moved to Tokyo from sydney as a well-paid skilled migrant. Overall, a lot of this video is correct, but not all of it. Immigrating here is actually very simple compared to what people face trying to move to the USA, EU or Australia. As long as you have a bachelors degree and can find a job here then you're in and the whole process requires no lawyers and costs almost nothing, and includes full access to the japanese health insurance system which is one of the best and most covered in the entire world.  Secondly on the whole "skilled migrants don't want to be paid less" realistically a skilled migrant who is actually skilled will be well paid, and likely will end up with a far better standard of living and balance sheet at the end of each month due to the significantly lower cost of living. In my example i took a 10% salary reduction to come to Japan, but i get paid a bonus of between 20-50% each year (this is very normal in JP) and cost of living is around 40% lower than Sydney. This leads to me being around 50% better off wealth wise here in Japan. All you need to do at that point is manage your forex risk and you will be fine.    The overtime is also over-stated and generally the expectations are not as intense for gajin or at foreign companies. Also, overtime is paid here. Despite working in a white collar job, i am paid for every hour that i work. That was not the case in Australia at all.   Overall Japan is a tough place to live, there is some racism, there is crazy paperwork, nothing is ever in english - literally nothing. But once you learn the language, all of that pain goes away. And what you're left with is a beautiful, clean, safe country where the middle-class still exists, where a normal office worker own a home, where most families only need a single breadwinner to survive if they want that.   The social contract still exists in Japan, in Australia it does not. If you don't already own property in Sydney you're done for, you will rent forever as part of the working poor.
*they got robbed by Capitalism* that is all
There is a major immigration issue this video failed to address. Japan doesn’t allow dual citizenship. It becomes easy to live in a country for the rest of your life pursuing a career if you can obtain citizenship. But, without dual citizenship availability you must give up your current citizenship. For Americans that means in almost all circumstances you can never be an American citizen again. An impossible decision to make for any potential “opportunity” you may have in Japan.
4:02 They still are. Sony's Xperia 1 & 5 still stand out in terms of camera quality and pro photography/videography features. They just can't keep up with Apple & Samsung's marketing budgets.
Do we really need an intense downwards inflection every 2nd line?
Japan's population has been shrinking for 15 years, that means that despite the economy in total being stagnant the wealth per capita has been growing. From a practical human perspective their economy has been growing. Total economic output doesn't matter nearly as much to people who are not economists as economic output per capita.
NOT while America still owns it !!!
3:25~  This is the fact that I don't quite understand this country.  Plus, just so you know, Japanese media and the government has a strong bond so that they can trick the general people.
Interesting how economists call steady (not increasing) economic output "stagnation".      Economies must for some reason always grow.    There seems to be no economic theories for harmonious shrinkage.
It's nothing weird man. You call it stagnation; I call it being a stable country. It's an island nation bruh and they have maximized efficiency in everything they do with the current technology WHILE keeping SUITSTAINLBILY at the top of their priorities as all first world countries should try to do. Manufacturing, technology, education, healthcare, government regulation, safety; Japan doesn't lack in any of these topics and more. Clearly, you've never lived in Japan. There is no problem to fix.
Maybe Japan's so called 'stagnation' should instead be called a perfect socioeconomic equilibrium
This should've been a five-minute video.
Nice
why does the thumbnail assume japan needs to be fixed? whats broken
If you ventured out of the major city like Tokyo or Osaka for more than 100km you will see the state of Japan that will break your rose tinted glass
Those are the worst who take GdP as THE marker for economic success and conclude we need to have more people to work more hours. Totally ignoring what’s actually beneficial to the welfare of the people. Working less needs to be the goal for anyone with two functioning brain cells. Technology should set us free - instead we are stuck in a loop of development, making workers unnecessary (which is great, theoretically), leaving workers afraid of advancement because they end up without income. Entire society isn’t even closely harvesting the benefits of economical and technological advancement they deserve.
It’s true they are stuck in the early 2,000s. To be honest I don’t think they will ever adapt it’s too rigid and many of the companies are so corrupt. People here are getting poorer and poorer. More and more Japanese are leaving after university to go to other places for better work opportunities, true many want to come back to Japan eventually but more youth don’t want to work here.
Insular local culture, long established rules & regulations on behaviour, 60s 70s years old decision makers, majority are aged....status quo is life. Lots of excellent clean toilets best exemplified Japan.
So what can happen if you take the virtue of respecting your elders too far? Your country is run by 100 year olds that think a candlelight is a keen invention.
As someone who has spent a lot of time in japan i can say that the japanese do not want immigration and are overall happy with thier country. They dont need fixing
“The US can pick the best and brightest “.  Have you seen the border?  Sorry they’re not bringing a high skill set.  We maybe can but we don’t anymore.
F inherited wealth. The only thing i have ever seen it create are monsters.
anybody can sum that up in a tl;dr for me?
Japan has been doing the same for 50 years and they are still expecting a different result
I am surprised you did not mention the Plaza Accord's impact on the stagnation of the Japanese economy
"best and brightest" oh man i don't want see the worst they have
doom and gloom economist have for ages counted out Japan. Japan have the highest living on earth. Yen goes up and down, who cares, their living still beats yours when it comes to service in all aspects of society. Food is cheaper in Japan or at least on par with some european countries, but what they don't tell you is that the quality is much higher so the price is actually even lower in Japan.
Your comments on Japan’s resistance to change will be their Achilles heel when it comes to adoption to EV’s. Given the importance of the auto industry to the economy, they have been left standing by Tesla and the Chinese auto industry and will take decades to recover if ever.
I've been working in Japanese tyre company for over 10 years now and I could say that they are reluctant to change. Any significant improvement is a big no,no. They still stuck in 2000's. Has been into one of their plant in Japan and it was old, outdated and low tech.
I feel that japan is like the ouroboros. A creature that will consume itself to perpetuity until it withers into nothingness and its already withering.   They dont want to take in foreigners, so they dont adopt english. They dont adopt english, then foreigners dont want to work there. Not enough workers, so over work the working population. Working population over worked, no time and energy for kids. Less kids,less workers, more overwork. Itll just continue on and on until Japan is gone
I think the statement about Japan's technology is a bit too black and white. Its a bit more nuanced than that. In the field of higher productivity, the topic of robotics and AI is definitely at the forefront. Japan, as a country with numerous companies and technologies that concern both AI and robotics, they do have some sort of edge when it comes to higher productivity. There are numerous japanese brands like 711 familymart and lawsons that are all implementing automated convivence stores by using Japanese-made robots. I don't think its fair to completely write off japanese technology like you do in the video. There are many cutting edge technologies in which Japan is very advanced in. With robotics and AI and investment in those areas, you have companies like Softbank, which are world leaders. In addition, when it comes to AI architecture and chip design, japan is strong (softbank aquisicion of ARM and japanese dominance in chipmaking tools/parts). With CMOS imaging semiconductors strong, and the 50% market share in robotics, Japan has a strong backbone to implement higher productive processes in many different industries. Although there definitely truth to what you said about Japan being in "2000," I don't think you've done enough research about Japanese technology and various advantages they have in your situation.
It's crazy that Japan's overworking problem is both incredibly obvious and contributes to most of the other major issues the country faces, and yet absolutely nothing has been done about it. How hard would it be for the government to just pass a law to limit the hours employees can work to a number more in line with other Western countries? If those extra hours aren't very productive anyway, would it even have a big negative impact on the economy?
Didn’t mention universal healthcare Didn’t mention sustainable pension system No comprehension of the safest and most pervasive public transit system in the entire world  You mention computers and fancy flip phones.  This analysis is mentally differently abled
Strange that no mention is made of Japan being the most indebted country in the world. Surely that is relevant here?
Some homes in small villages are almost for free in Japan
What do you mean by “our own economies”, you seem to assume that none of us are Japanese? Or that we’re all from the same economy?
Boring video
i think that Japan is immigration-averse EVEN at the detriment of their economic growth(to certain extent , it applies to Germany.) .Both countries haven't or don't wish to learn from other inclusive nations
The MUCH bigger problem for Japan is their Demographic decline!
Europe and the USA are in recession. Japan is doing fine.
make video on Nepal's economy.
I went to Japan for a year in highschool. When i returned to Germany, I saw the misery of living in Germany. The average "poor" person in Japan is so much more wealthy than the average "poor" person in Germany. In Germany, you can tell if people are poor. In Japan, it's way harder. I saw far less homeless people in Japan, and the ones that i saw, where way tidier than the ones i saw in Germany.  I think that most japanese people live the average life. In Germany, you have more rich but also more poor people in whose middle the average lies. This allows the japanese society to be even more homogeneous than they already are. They can afford the same things, do the same things and think the same way about things. I felt like this led to a happier society because everyone understood eachother and was happy with being average. There were less arguments, manners would be followed more closely and everything would work much smoother. Eating out was also much cheaper in Japan and the quality seemed much higher. Dishes were prepared from zero (in germany most normal restaurants will have some components of their dishes be initially frozen and just reheated) and felt well balanced. In Japan, almost all people can afford eating out regularly, going on vacation, spending money on entertainment and having trendy wardrobes.  I also saw that school in Japan can be extremely stressful. But at the same time, its also way more fun than my school in Germany could ever dream of. We had so many events, and so many different club activities. It was insane.
I find the repetitive sing-song vocal inflection at the end of every phrase very annoying. I am Australian like the speaker, and this is not a normal part of the accent.
It's best to have as little to do with U.S if it's ever going to be beneficial anymore as the last 70 yrs have demonstrated
"Been living in the year 2000 since the 1970s" What a quote!
Germany seems to be very very similar. Since it’s reunification politically much of its social state was undermine and now seemingly nothing works properly if at all, will be interesting to see where the “sick man of Europe” ends up
I've been traveling around the world a lot and I can tell you by living in Japan for a while, I've never had a higher standard of living than there as an average person. In most western countries so much is inflated, everything became unimaginably expensive with very little added lifestyle value. So we have to really question ourselves, where do you think this GDP goes? If your answer is military then you got it. Our leaders are just playing chess on behalf of all of us.
I hope it will not.
Eventually though as migrant workers assimilate, their children will end up competing with the children of native citizens. Seems inevitable that this will be the case. So you end up with a larger population but with the "average" person (kids graduate high school with no criminal record and get a job or go to college right away) making less than before, ie a super inflated middle class that is increasingly  separated from the upper class.
I thought I am going to watch your explanation what's changing in the Japan's economy recently but what you were talking about is the history. Not what I wanted to see.
JP would rather shrink to non-existence than let jolly foreigners in.
Migration is heavily driven by welfare programs that are offered to imagrents
Let me guess, Japan needs more africans and arabs?
Japanese population is aging. 29% of their population are grandpas and grandmas. This will lead to balooning retirement cost as there is less number of workers that leads to less pension fund collection and less tax collection as well. Japan has a culture that cannot get along with foreigners. Only recently they realize they need to invite more foreigners to work there. Given their culture, it wont be easy for them to get a lot of foreign workers. Although they have achieved high standard of livig, aging population, stagnant growth can create gloomy future for their youngsters
"Japan is a country that's been living in the year 2000 since the 1970s" perfectly sums it up! 💯
Japan's stagnation is the result of unconstrained deficit spending.  They are far-and-away the most indebted government of the world, and they are paying for it.
Janpan will sink.
Well if they cant get their birth rate up nothing will change. If they want to have a chance they must get the birth rate up
Japanese houses are smaller and less equipped than many rural homes in developing countries like India.
AAAHH THE AI GENERATED STOCK VIDEO CLIPS! They’re getting under my skin, seeping into me eyes….. noooo… help meeee… …… 💀
Growing up, Japan was always described to me as the city of the future. After visiting for the first time, I described it as the city of the future 25 years ago.
Wages in Japan suck. Young Japanese are looking for jobs in New Zealand, as the minimum wage there is twice what it is in Japan. (Note: in Japan the minimum wage will vary, from prefecture to prefecture.)
I love the info but how fast he talks is stress inducing. I decided to stop watching after a couple minutes. (I can't slow down the speed when watching on my Chromecast.)
7:36 Shoutout ANU
10:17 The 'tool' in the blue top wearing those glasses that have no lenses is what damages economies. They are called poseurs and it's best to avoid people pretending to be something they're not.
The national pension and national health insurance are ponzi schemes that require an ever-growing population to pay for.  But since an ever-growing population is only a feature of developing countries not developed ones, developed countries such as Japan inevitably pay for these systems via inflation, wage stagnation, and sacrificing the young to the old.   Those who scream "what about a safety net" fail to observe that there will be no safety net for those who, upon receiving their state pension 40-45 years later, find that the value of 100 yen from their first paycheque is only worth 25% of the value of when they first (mandatorily) paid into it and they would have been far better off investing this money themselves for a 3-5% per year return.  When Japanese media and politicians talk about "shoshikamondai" (the problem of declining population) they never admit the elephant in the room which is, without the Japanese welfare state in place, it's not a difficult problem to overcome at all.
when i first saw the heading of this video, i thought it was the shibuya incident happening in real life🤣🤣🤣🤣
Japanese even has a word for dying from overwork
High taxes, no investment incentive, no land investment...strict rules...ok you get it.  Its the government!
The economies of China and The US are woefully unstable and overly manipulated. Japan's economy is stable meaning that it's operating fairly self sufficiently which is better for their citizens. Unlike the US that has 200 oligarchs and a burgeoning serf population.
Another reason why Japanese salaries are so low is the absolutely oppressive tax code. I make the equivalent of $125k and my marginal tax rate is 42%. Combine that with the fact that you almost never get raises and the Japanese aversion to job hopping, and you wind up with a highly uncompetitive workforce.  Also, Paul Krugman is a dirty chiester and shouldn't be trusted.
The garbage you are spewing, sometimes you need to slow down. Some people may not understand you. 😮
Japan is the world's largest creditor nation and its current account surplus is at an all-time high. In other words, Japan can live well without growth.
Haha, nobody here dare talk about thhe Plaza Accord😂
Wait, am I missing something at 13:05? 10000 yen is like 70 usd.
Paul Krugman is famous for stating that the internet would not be more influential to the economy than a fax machine. Let that sink in.
Dunno.. We've survived many centuries on our own without other peoples' advice.  So I guess we don't necessarily need other folks meticulously telling us what's wrong and what to do now, either. 😺
this video is a long way of saying economists really just do want line to go up and don't care if you have to grind babies into paste to get it there, and why we shouldn't care about their opinions so much.
Paul Krugman the most infuential economist?  That must be a joke, the same guy that said the internet will be no greater impact than the fax machine.  Looking at Japan's economy without looking at it's monetary and fiscal policy gives an incomplete picture
Who in their right mind wants to live in Norway? So cold and dark in winter.
The last thing Japan should is encourage an immigration policy like the US, Europe, or the UK.
I am a mexican living in Japan,  my income is barely higher that it was in mexico, not really a deal, the yen is just to cheap, and life is expensive, not the place to make any money, but at least I can live happily with my family without worrying about crime, and a good quality life
One of the things that brasses me off the most about the productivity paradox is that better technology was supposed to make us more productive and therefore we could have more leisure time. Can anyone genuinely claim that they are working less than before?
The Japanese people is and has been racist for an extremely long period of time.  There issues with immigration isn't shocking at all.
Japan quietly lifts ban. World: Oh, dassooo bad! Me: My electric bill might fall back to its original affordability after 12 years of those things being shut down?!?!?
Japanese so called amerikan  allies tries to kill all economies by forcing them to devalue their currencies, its not economics it's daylight robbery
demographics are destiny
what exactly is the USA producing? that its economy is still growing
japan has excellent  infrastructure and a government that is accountable unlike the USA
Japan needs more children. A lot of the problems would be solved with a birth rate of 2.1
no  japan will be fine they dont have to import a bunch of low skilled non japanese to make their Miso Soup
Japan has the power of god and anime on its side
Every time anything at all from This channel starts streaming it's just a morass of economic stream of consciousness word salad.... How do I get this channel to never get recommended or auto played again.  Freaking gobbledygook
I wanted to learn about debt, federal reserve banks, government ownership of stocks, and exchange rates.  What I got was birth rates, and just make people work more.
Japan being Japan
Quality of life is way better in Japan than in America. I think some points in the video are off, it really just does come down to salary and more importantly language as the main reason migration here is out of whack. Affordable public transportation in a CLEAN, SAFE, and quiet area is available to most in the country. It is shockingly quiet compared to places like NYC where you have people blasting bass and everything is horribly overpriced. Anywhere else, you need a car to travel in the US too. An average person can afford a new home in their 30s in central Tokyo, but good luck on an average salary affording to buy ANYTHING let alone rent in Manhattan, lol. Salaries are lower overall, but the cost of living is like half of what is back in the states somewhere like NYC. It's also much more friendly to foreigners these days, it's very easy to make friends compared to 10 years ago.
People forget Japan had a GDP equal to Germany, France and the UK combined, such an economy was hard to sustain...
I'm going to guess one of the big challenges is racism.  Gives me mixed feelings.  I like Japan and I want it to continue to exist.  If they were just to open the floodgates to emigration like the southern US border, I fear it would loose a lot of its unique charm.  That said, it's the culture I would preserve. I don't actually believe in race, and I don't think genetic isolation is a good thing.    Can they open up slow but steady immigration in a way that allows people to culturally assimilate and become Japanese?
They need to first fix population growth…
Japan is so effing BORING ❗...aka stagnation, huh?
- advancement comes mostly from cross discipline expansion of tech - the bulk of those come from hobbies, hobbies weren't profitable until X was added, then it became profitable for production or scientific investigation - without free time there isn't resources to put into culture or hobbies so both become abbreviated and degrade to the lowest common denominator, which becomes a product due to ubiquitousness
argentina: abundance breeds arrogance  japan: fall down seven times, get up eight
I can't remember if you brought it up but, in my opinion, an underrepresented issue in Japan is their view on failure. In America, we view failure as a part of the process. Someone starting a company and failing is mocked but not looked down on, if that makes sense. In Japan, failing is viewed much more negatively, and someone is very unlikely to try starting a company or even modifying their own company for fear of failure.
Add up all the skinny women in America. The number would not even come close to any city in Japan😂😂😂
its not weird, its just that america is making use of japan to boost their economic power and because japan lose WW2 they can only let that happen
What an😂 ignorant fluff piece ,is this real? Funny you have no idea, ,
I don't see really how the huge demographic decline they are experiencing could not bring an impoverishment of their society. Low employment rate, pensions and healthcare on the sholders of a small workforce. To me it seams they lack the fundamentals to regain productivity and wealth.
This is because the leadership of Japan thinks the kids are dumb. In reality, the kids are way smarter than the old egomaniacs running the country. Those kids are now giving the government the middle finger by not procreating, not working, not getting married, not buying cars, and the whole economy is going downhill. The kids are right, that is the only thing that really scares the rulers. No more slaves to extort. Keep in mind that this trend will have a cumulative effect with time. The true effects of this are yet to be seen!
I really is terrifying to think about what we are going to do once we can’t exploit under developed nations any more.
If japan is 23 years behind, then canada is 50 years behind. I say this as a Canadian who visited east asia for four months for the first time in over 30 years.
I'm smelling your eternal growth paradigm......
You need to explain how USA "didn't like" Japanese dominance and the actions against Japan in late eighties/nineties.
Stock values are not an indication of anything more than the few owners like hedge funds and pension plans.....
Chinas GDP are exaggerated by about 30%
I'm at the point of rage seeing how many fat people are here in America and even defend it. Most Americans don't realize they weigh as much as the average sumo wrestler. At least Japan isn't proud to be morbidly obese. They are the most fit country in the world.
This video severely underestimates Japan's core technological prowess. Although Japanese companies may appear conservative, they possess significant technological advancements compared to other global counterparts. The fact that major South Korean and Chinese companies continue to acquire technology from Japan underscores this reality. Additionally, it's inaccurate to assume that every company will transition to being an IT company. Therefore, the analysis provided at 3:39 is inherently flawed. Microsoft and Apple, for instance, do not engage in the production of cars, steel, ships, etc., which are crucial components of our economy. Comparing them to companies like Toyota and Mitsubishi is silly, as they operate in entirely different sectors. In my opinion, this is your worst video
Two thoughts:  1. I think the issue with Japanese migration is less that people are interested, and more that Japan is culturally highly resistant to migrants. I have had highly educated friends (even some with Japanese spouses) who have had to wait years to get documentation (if they even do), and it's even worse for unskilled laborers (like people that could look after and elderly population). Japan has a lot of cultural strength that makes it an appealing place to live, but it can be incredibly isolating to foreigners on both a social and policy level.  2. I wish you had touched more on why nearly 40% of working age adults aren't working, because it feels like it's framed in the video as a luxury or choice, while (at least in my experience) a large chunk of that is either people who are unable to find a job (including groups like those with disabilities that you did touch on) or people who are care takers (for children, older people or disabled family), which is a huge amount of work and adds a great amount of stress to a family unit.
Thanks!
When it comes to Japan, I think more emphasis should likely be placed on their population.  It has remained largely the same since the 1990's.  Compared with the US, which has grown 75% since 1990.
Singing the song of endless growth, aren't we? Stagnation on high level is nothing bad. Its where all things have to end up, if we can't magically expand this globle.
Japan demands a lot of unpaid over time from its workers so it is impossible to use that as a metric for increasing GDP. Cheap housing in Tokyo?  😆😅🤣 Also if you buy an old house to renovate you have to have a geological survey to test for soil contamination because after the war a lot of unregulated chemical use happened that tainted the soil. That's why you see some lots where a house once stood, standing empty as the land failed the contamination test and it was too expensive to have it decontaminated.  Japan's debt to GDP is astronomical and unable to withstand a black swan even like the recent earthquake. This has led the BOJ to inject some 80 billion yen in stimulations to the economy.  It could also result in Japan dumping US treasuries to raise cash as it can't raise taxes due to the fragile economy. Doing this would flood the secondary bond market with US treasuries making it difficult for the US to fund more debt upon which it has relied heavily to drive its GDP for at least three quarters. This could in turn make US debt more expensive and lead to a collapse of the US economy or a debt default.
Japan is about to sink and thats a fact
"It's nice to think that the historic trend of limitless growth in a finite world will continue."  I always felt like endless growth was a short-sighted component of our economic models.  It made more sense to me to prioritize stabilization.  Growth for the sake of growth seems very 'cancerous' .
I hope Japan does well. I pray their work culture gets a major update (especially in the anime industry, which has a major crisis with how terrible the working conditions are) so people can make a proper living and can have relationships again. It's unfortunate what's happened there, but in some ways, it's on them. They're going back to old habits of centuries past.
whats weird is the US limited it's colony at 5T and have recently allowed that limit to be lifted. so it will grow again. the risk at the time is the same risk now with China. end video.
Zoning in America is specifically designed around an uncheck run away criminal culture.
13:01 10000 yen is not ~200 dollars but ~50 dollars, you did the math the wrong way
Women in the workplace = low birth rates.
"Best and brightest" yeah right, that's bs looking at all those 'doctors and engineers' coming to EU :' )
I’m from Argentina and people are crazy here because of Peronism, is like if Spanish still praising Franco
Productivity does not mean everything when talking about quality of live. If this would be true why today in western countries which are the most productive countries ever depression rates are higher than ever. Or look at the time of the industrial evolution. It was a time of greater inequality between countries and people in them than some time before. The social tension which were the product of this time are the reason for 1,5 world wars. Productivity is nothing when it is not used for the better of the masses. Sadly in capitalism this is often not the case.
Could you do a video on the economy of Paraguay? Maybe even do a twofer where you compare it to Bolivia (the other landlocked country in South America) and talk about how their sociological and geopolitical differences influence their economies?
I think we are underestimating the potential of digital and electronic economies.
People would not prefer to live in Norway because the per person productivity is better their but because life Standard is higher. Life standard means something different. It means that people have a fulfilled healthy life. This is a big difference to a high productivity. Especially extrem capitalist country’s like to forget the difference.
this video has a blind spot when talking about immigrants in Japan, there are actually a huge amount of foreign workers in Japan earning miserable incomes and supporting its economy, they just don't have citizenship
meanwhile most of Youtube: CHINA WILL COLLAPSE NEXT YEAR!!!   people are so stupid and misinformed
I called Japan the Future of the 1980s in 2006 when I went there and saw they were 20 years ahead of everyone in 1986 and stayed that way and this has proven to be more true each year.
people actually believe those numbers from the CCP are accurate?
I was under the impression that the whole migration=good was already properly debunked by now. The results of all that migrations can be seen and felt in full across western europe. Spoiler warning: it's a disaster!  Highly controlled and regulated migration on the other hand can have a net positive result most of the time.
I love Japan (been there a few times). The infrastructure and the transportation system is just top in the world. Its so safe and clean. In my opinion they are more technology advance than what this guy is saying. Japan is the closet country to creating a utopia. Im also from America.
Side note, the graph at the beginning shows why the US is trying so hard to pull China down.
yea because Japan's problem are minor. The countries of Europe can properly also be fixed, but it reqires a lot more, however America is doomed. DOOMED!
A place where they are taught to worship their dead relatives committing shirk with the One Who Created them… what do you expect?
there are for sure MANY downsides to importing migrant workers, such as cultural erosion and increased terrorism threats. The lie of "migration is our savior" is currently destroying europe.
LET JAPAN BE JAPANESE...STOP PROMOTING YOUR DEGENERATE LIBERAL VIEW INTO THE WORLD
They might have issues but I think high inheritance taxes and affordable housing are for sure going to be a huge advantage for them in the long run in comparison to the Western economies. In the West people will become more and more unhappy with the gap between poor and rich growing bigger and bigger. They will feel less and less in control and become more and more unhappy feeling as if they just work to sustain a life instead of being able to live freely. It will  (and already does) cause incredible tension and issues in societies and politics which will negatively affect the economy. Japan though does not seem to face an issue in the future in that regard which to me looks as if they are generally facing a more stable future than most other currently still well-performing countries.
I’d like to see a video from you about population decline and the economic relalities of it. I’ve heard some cray statistics about North Korea and their next couple of generations. Japan and Korea seem to be speed running what Europe will likely go through.
6:29 the main flaw in the logic behind doubling your workforce by having women also work is that a 2-income household doesn't really consume more goods and services than a 1-income household. Scaling this up, that means that aggregate demand for labor doesn't actually increase and what ends up happening is that you have twice as many workers competing for the same sized pie.
4:55 This is a gross oversimplification, productivity of a person is not  linear with time worked. Case in point, Japanese workers work long hours, too long in fact, so much so that their productivity per time working is very low due to exhaustion. Humans are not robots, we need rest.
This analysis is asinine. There is absolutely no reason that a sound economy needs inflation. 😂
That ~50% inheritance tax in Japan is awesome. That's one important step towards actual meritocracy.
The French Minister of Culture was asked why the French were less productive than the Japanese. Her answer, We are not ants! Kinda says it all.
Please make a video about Austria 🇦🇹
Anything in excess is harmful
I'm not sure why you would be so critical on a country that is actually proven to be far more stable than many other developed countries in the world. I mean when looking at the other "better" countries you mention there is a reason why wealth accumulation to a concentrated few actually hurts a society way more and it's by homeless people are on the rise in North America... I love how you also mention that self interest like it's a good thing when the general population knows that it isn't right to shape the society based on a single person rather having it being shaped to the public's vision.   This is why I absolutely hate economists and analysts because they play the numbers game like that is the only thing that matters in life. Just reminds me of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k5aVLi_yhM  I don't know why people think increasing numbers by an exponential amount is the only way to improve when we can look to achieve stability (linear progression) rather finding stupid reasons to be more competitive for the sake of it. The way I look at it is: "Competition is good but too much competition is bad" and the newer generation is realizing this and the older generation such as yourself just thinks ever increasing numbers by multiple factors is everything.
No  That's why I left there 20 years ago and it's only gotten worse based on what I've heard
17:46 without inflation companies. A make profits through new products? What!! That is the way to make profits in a low inflation economy. But they are conservative you say - so you actually mean making accounting profits by raising the prices on existing products.
The UK has added more than 10 million people through immigration over the last 20 years. Real wages are flat, the infrastructure has been sweated making it worse for everyone, debt has risen from 40% to 100% of GDP and we have all the social and cultural problems of people being told not to integrate with ‘worthless’ British culture.  Mass immigration has not made British citizens better off. We are just forced into adjusting everything into an immigrant class that is numerically greater than indigenous Britons in a growing number of cities and jobs.  All wonderful so long as making life better for British citizens isn’t your goal.
migration propaganda
I am not sure about the quality of life-part though. Apart from the work, Japan doenst have to hide compared to the US or Western Europe. Regarding safety, i would say Japan is better than both. Also the cultural amenities are very very high in Japan.
the difference between Argentina and japan is socialist policies, economics is highly political. nations that offer better socialist policies do better regardless of natural resources.
Not sure about 10000 yen being 200usd today chief. The rest very informative though thanks.
The government is pumping money into the Zaibatsus, that's why.  They'll fall from a higher elevation.
It better cuz Japan is one of the greatest countries on earth.
Japan going for quality over quantity
So whats the weird thing happening in japan? What a weird video. Nothing new was said
Every country and their directions are rapidly changing. The mind cannot be understood, and the direction of the mind is also constantly making turns by it'self.
Japan needs to BREED!
Japan will succeed so long as it stays ethnically Japanese and doesn't take in refuse disguised as refugees.
2:39 just like in communism.
Why does an economy need to always grow? Why is sustainable consistency not ok? I don’t understand why we as a species are so obsessed with limitless growth of our economies.
Argentina vs. Japan probably a cultural thing. East Asians are known for their work ethic and emphasis on education.
Can i read your content somewhere
¥10000 is definitely NOT $200, lol. If rates were that good I could afford to vacation (live in Japan)
China is taking over Japan's business
I dont know in which reality you live, but the majority of migrants coming into Europe are not “doctors and engineers”. The overwhelming majority of social welfare users are migrants. I suggest you sometimes look at reality instead of an economics book
Dude I live in Japan and the living standards for the working class are way higher than the U.S on average. It might not be the case if you take a small demographic of rich tech workers in California as an example, but here regular people actually have access to quality public education, transportation, healthcare, affordable groceries, housing and general public  infrastructure.
Return of Godzilla ?
I believe GDP is an outdated metric - it shoud be balanced against total debt the economy carries. As Japan´s debt is 300% of it´s GDP, the interest is eating up all gains.
B******s, Japan is great, watch your stew
Infinite growth is a dumbass goal. More countries should figure out how to maintain a high standard of living while growth is minimal. At a certain point everyone will need to stop growing
Japan has a massive, technologically advanced, industrial base. Most high tech manufacturing equipment is made there. If there is ever another war it could quickly shift to manufacturing needs to support that as is evidenced by its top companies. The United States could send emails I suppose which is evidenced by its top companies.
China will KO the Japanese economy in 5-7 years..
Very deceptive report. Smart phome share is an example.  Most of the phones are made in China no matter the share by country.
Anywhere in the world you go Japanese cars are everywhere. Japan is the only ally to the US that makes advanced manufacturing equipment for pretty much any industry.  The US doesn't anymore. They are a top three country technologically and for entrepreneurship.  They are doing something right.
Wrong. Standard of living in Japan is VERY high.
I believe Japan has destroyed the pacific Ocean marine life with all their radioactive waste. They keep dumping into the ocean from their power plant meltdown. And I can't believe the governments of the world allow them to do it
Some skinny Somali went to Japan and acted like a fool, cementing the image of foreigners
The solution for Japan is the same as for everywhere else: ban democracy and move to a net taxpayer meritocracy, ban welfare so that taxes go down and lazy bums are forced to either work and be productive or leave the nation, and ban feminism so that women are forced to form nuclear families that give working men a reason to stay alive and actually put up with what's expected of them instead of abandoning society and just doing the bare minimum to sustain themselves.  Oh, and never allow multiculturalism to take root, that destroys social cohesion. One nation, one culture, one language. K.I.S.S.
10k yen is more like US$70, not US$200...
when it becomes a sovereign nation with its own interests placed first
Why Japan is not growing? It's simple. It's a closed country. They're highly racist towards foreigners. Look at what happened to Carlos Ghosen of Nissan-Renault. You can't grow an economy when foreigners are treated so poorly. Innovation will fee.
Japan's economy is more likely to fail. Their population is declining and has been for a while now. They have only held on by making people work 14+ hours every day.
They aren’t bring skilled 3rd worlders it’s anyone they can get to keep letting parties in power.   Hopefully Japan avoids losing its identity to the brown hordes.
Japan might go up and down a bit, but it will NEVER go broke.
Uuuuh They are japanese??? They are too based to need that much gdp????
Something weird is always happening in Japan
Joan E. Donoghue a former U.S. state department official is the ICJ president that will be in charge of the case. She is already working with blinken and the Biden administration. I am sure they are working on how to throw the case out under some claim that Israel has a right to defend itself against terrorists who are hiding amongst the Palestinian people. And will try and place the blame and responsibility along with claiming Israel is being humane in trying to work with other countries to take in Palestinians to save their lives if some BS along those lines
Japan also wants to preserve its culture, safety, and people. That’s the biggest reason they don’t have migrants.   They really do want you to give up your homeland.
'Japan is living in the year 2000, and it's been living there since the 1970's'   Love that saying - it sums it up perfectly
So if the inheritance tax in Japan is 50% why doesn't the person especially the old just give there wealth to relatives before they die obviously the relatives would liok after them giving them money when asked but would avoid the tax.
The problem is Japan does not  like taking imagrants they prefer to keep there race pure and Japanese.
JAPAN SHOULD BE MORE ADVANCED! not enough vending machines and cat toys that keep your money.
the way you finish sentences is the most atrcious thing ever existeeeeuuud..............
8:33 that is the biggest joke I’ve ever heard 😂 do you know what’s happening right now in Europe?! We get the people from poor countries because even their own countries don’t want them. And they come to Europe with the intention to exploit our generous welfare systems and that’s what they end up doing. They DON‘T work because they are unqualified and not willing to change anything about. They don’t wanna learn the language, they don’t wanna blend in, they don’t wanna interact with the locals. Hopefully, the war in Syria will end soon, so they leave our countries to build up their country
I had always heard that Att couldn’t get into the computer market because of the antitrust lawsuit. And licensing was done for almost nothing because of fears of further action
Big problem would be a Bank of Japan failure 😅
Japan’s economy was seen as an existential threat to US and we know what happened!! The rest is history!!!
Economists do not predict the future.  Physics however...
1:55 Woahhhhh, you seriously need to check your sources. That law has NOTHING todo with censoring media outlets.  Sorry, but thumbs down on the video.
That was informative if only you narrated it more slowly.
Playback speed  0.75   is much more better...
H1-B workers are paid far less than Americans doing the same job, sure they may make $90K/year and therefore be in the top 10% of salaries, but an American would be earning $120K - $180K in the same role. Claiming that they are “the highest paid workers” is disingenuous at best, companies hire them because they’re far cheaper, not because they’re “the best in the world” as you claim.
The car you used to represent the civic is actually a CRZ
Japans been stuck in 2000 since the 70s.  The U.K. has gone back to the 70s in 2024😂
10000 Yen is not worth 200 US dollars bruh
If Japanese are an advanced economy with a good quality of life, are living longer than anyone else in the world, are happy then what's the problem? Why do they need more growth?
Refreshing with a country that isn't leaving old techniques and values behind. They respect their old, and the old respect their past. Japan will stand tall in the future, albeit with less growth. Krugman is a joke.
Economic Growth does not necessarily make a country better to live in & is a bad goal. Iften it makes it much, much, much worse. Like making a housing crisis is economic growth.
While your claim that "a single worker using an excavator can replace 100 workers using shovels" may be true, the second half of that sentence "the use of technology carries this on to almost every aspect..." is definitely wrong. Where did you find any kind of statistics that would say that the use of computers would have increased productivity anywhere? It is known for very long that they do NOT increase productivity: "In 1987 Robert Solow famously remarked that computing is everywhere except in the productivity statistics." Speaking of Japan, Toyota found out that even robots do NOT increase productivity which is why "Toyota is deliberately taking a step backward and replacing automated machines in some factories in Japan and creating heavily manual production lines staffed with humans,"
How people are doing as individuals in a country is more important than what a country’s economy size is. We can’t keep going down the path of eternal growth, as that relies on human populations continuing to grow which is not sustainable, and that’s what I think we are now discovering. The future needs to focus on sustainability rather than infinite growth.
What's going on in Japan? _Some weird sht_
As long as they dont choose the immigration route then everything will be fine. Not a single country in the first world that "chose" immigration became better.   Immigration is suicide
I know you probably won't see my comment but can you please make a video the lebanese economy. I think there financial miracle and following collapse is incredebly interesting.
Japan has a risk of natural disasters like earthquakes, tsunamis, and even nuclear crises. Do these things affect investment or long term planing?
Although everything said in this video is probably true based on the used metrics, I disagree with the perspective on so many levels. And I hope Japan will continue to resist immigration and "stay in 2000s".
I had no idea that an australian accent could have a valley girl variant.
As an econ major myself. Im surprised that u still believe the field of study to have any value and that all things can be explained or should be looked at through and economists lens. This hard on for growth that economists have is part of a poorly thought out and corrupt system.  Endless growth is not the goal and japan hasnt been experiencing stagnation so much as it has been experiencing a state of equilibrium. Canada has been "growing" over the past decade according to gdp but its been propped up by a real estate market bubble. The only way this trudeau govt could make it look like the economynis doing well under their tyrannical communist reign.
it's not weird it's just late-state capitalism
Of course something weird is going on. Gojo has been sealed😢
I haven’t heard a single valid reason why high income economies whose populations aren’t growing naturally should still be striving for growth in output, at this point its not creating welfare for people its just destroying our ecosystems and creating lots of trash
Almost all the USA H-1B workers are brought in to undercut local workers, not because there is a skills shortage but because they're just cheaper. This means the local workers cannot afford to choose high skilled jobs that cost a lot to train in or live in high cost cities.
Bad video. I hope everyone watches this video can see how bad it is few screenshots from the press, and few imaginary numbers ( GDP etc ...) don't make you think understand Japanese economy
Let's focus on people's happiness, quality of life and harmony with the natural world, rather than 'GDP', 'productivity' or 'growth'.
A lot of this video is correct, some is off the mark, but the biggest failure is the lack of discussion of the super high tax burdens, massive wasteful government spending and the resulting inflation and government regulations are the most important reasons for Japan falling behind.
Japan shouldn't have invested in so many US bonds/loaned so much money to the US. If they put that money in infrastructure they would rival China.
You're interrupting your commercials with commercials? I'm out.
We’re all slaves to the rich growth is all that matters to them.
Massive military spending boosts the economy and that's what is happening too.
I know this is not a car channel, but errors like this can be off putting for people who know and can be usually avoided quite easily.  The “Civic” shown is not a Civic, and is instead a Honda CR-Z. The “C Class” is also incorrect, and is instead a Mercedes CLS Class.
I think the issue is that the abandonment of religion in the West over the last ~200 years has meant that economic growth has become the new religion; something I call "Holy GDP Line-Go-Up". Once the demographic and capital crisis really hits a bit later this century, it will create a situation where this 'religion' will fail and force people to find another reason for living outside of base materialism. Japan is leading the way in seeing where this goes.
Quoting Krugman = downvote   Please, the man is as reliable as Jim Cramer.
This is the first time ever I cannot handle content in English. For me, a man without native English your pronunciation is waaay too fast. Just a potentially helpful observation ❤
What exactly is the “weird” thing Japan is experiencing? I learned nothing I didn’t already know for dozens of videos out there. More research and less click bait, mate.
great information 🤔👍
something 'happened' to Japan. that was America. no hate. just stating facts.
> Something weird is happening in Japan  Finally, somebody has to speak up about those tentacles videos.
hmm, i wonder what other nation had the most impact on Argentina's and Japan's economic development... i wonder how much they've meddled
@EconomicsExplained, I think there was a mistake in the currency conversion around 13m0s; 10,000JPY is roughly 70USD today (at a rate of ~ 142JPY:1USD), not 200USD.
God won't do it. Maybe it can't do it and isn't all powerful.
Can humanity be fixed?
The big question, is how to actually get real economic figures from China - all of there numbers are falsely reported.
Maybe I completely missed some context but 10000 Yen is only worth like $70 today
So whats the weird thing that is happening in japan?
Great video
For almost 30 years , Japanese investors have been investing outside of Japan such as Korea and China. On the other hand, there aren’t many investments invested in Japan.   Now that a lot of investors pulled out of China, there are two directions. One is back to Japan, but they are likely search for another developing country
Weakening a country can be done by limiting their electric power generation ability, increasing their reliance on importation, which will cause their utility bills to rise, and cost of living to rise as well. Weakening their health can be done by introducing more western type of foods high in carbohydrates. It can be observed in Japan’s case.
in a nutshell. in 80s japan lived in year 2000 and in 2023 still lives in 2000
¥10000 yen is nowhere remotely close to $200 unless im mistaking the sentence
And they have managed it all without mass immigration. Who knew hey.
The major contribution to Japan's current situation is simply their inability/unwillingness to adapt.... Be it their mindsets or their working culture.......
The must be self sustaining and enjoy the electronics. The measure of nations is quality of life.
10:53 Jakarta is secon with 34 milloon not Delhi
What you said about GDP doubling with hours doubling isn't necessarily true. You should be more pedantic, giving false impressions is bad.
Everything was fine until you quoted krugman.
So all the migrants coming from poor countries are their best and brightest???  Do you need economic GROWTH in a country with a declining population? Especially if their need are being met.
Will anything be able to surpass the production quality of the animated films from 80s-90s Japan is one question I have.
@14:45 I felt this in my soul. I’m a skilled worker living in Japan and this vid is EXACTY spot on.
So let me get this straight. Japanese people enjoy stable price due to low inflation, affordable housing, universal healthcare, free education, stable society, and stable currency at the cost of "growth". Please explain to me what's so great about "growth" that we need to sacrifice all of the above just to "grow" like the US where housing aren't affordable, prices are exorbitant, inflation at an all time high, outrageous healthcare, turbulent society, and their citizens are unhappy?
Somehow I'm glad Japan stayed in the 2000's when you see the social and cultural issues in the US and Europe. The 2000's were peak culturally.
There is also an Argument that japan is choosing to stay in Stagnation in order to Preserve its Culture, people, and future. Because there is a cost to a nation that is constantly growing without given a chance to fix some underlying cultural issue due to Change that will have to be paid eventually.  I take it japan has realized their Miracle has gone to far and shift their view on value from raw economic numbers to more nuanced social, cultural, and moral ones. Which is why they are so gung ho on NOT accepting foreigners. Bringing people in also comes with bringing their problem, and the complication on top of that. In my view the key word to japan mindset is the word "Preserve". I am both sceptical and Respectful to that choice. There is more to a nation than just Raw Numbers.
The problem is... No babies.  The work 9 9 6 and have no time for family.  Fastest aging demographic along with China.
I love getting lost in a video that goes over my head😂
Immegration is not as cut and dry as you say.   Good immegration only works if they dont bring too much of their culture to the new country. Clashing cultures will caues major issues.  A mix a cultures is really good. But pockets of clashing cultures will cause conflicts.  If economists only see the economy like you explained, then they are missing key factors in society. They are very tunnel vissioned. As someone living in Japan, I can tell you that you are right in your points, but are a little off in why they are like that.  You need to look at Japanese articles to get a better perspective of the japanese economy.
It is far more desirable for the happiness of the people to control the media, which is obsessed with hypocrisy and arrogance and often manipulates facts  and incites propaganda.
I remember when you couldn't see past the next block in both L A & TOKYO...mid 70s
Even Vietnamese workers in Japan are going back to Vietnam because of the yen. Imagine: Vietnamese. Mind blowing.
Imagine what would happen to Japan if “someone” started shipping thousands of immigrants a day to them.
Dislike
The fact that Japan is stagnating while their population is shrinking is impressive.
Dude you are terrible. Apple and Microsoft valuations are based on record high stock prices at this very moment. Saying it is bigger than entire Japan you are makeing yourself sound silly.
so weird.
Gdp is unreliable.  If you print money and just send it, that doesn't mean your economy is growing.
-Paul Krugman also said the internet would be no more consequential than the fax machine 😂.
By now Japan should have had automated factories, where half the workforce would produce twice as much, but instead it was stuck in the manufacturing technology of the late 1990s. Now maybe other countries would take over the roles and whoever the country i will be is a win for the their future, no migration would be needed.
Will anime save everything?
Considering the mess most other 1st world countries are in, surely it's a good thing that Japan is still living in the year 2000? Perhaps there is just less corruption.
Not once in your video have you mentioned that sadly Japan has suffered a lot of natural disasters over the last thirty years.Which has had a massive effect on there economy and the Japanese people are very professional and honorably people who are very hard working.And my thoughts and my heart goes out to all the people affected by the latest disasters that they have been hit by in the last few days.And can I please ask for you to have a bit of REPECT you
Immigration is not the answer.  There is no point in making GDP go up if the result is the destruction of your culture and people.  Instead, Japan needs to strongly enforce laws against overwork, and encourage workers to enjoy recreation time.  When people have a chance to relax and socialize it tends to lead to relationships and family building.   Most workers in Japan don't even use all of their available vacation time.  If they did, it would be a great boon to their domestic tourism industry and everything related to it.    Stop subsidizing foreigners lusting over anime cosplayers, and provide subsidies for raising families.
Cheap houses in Japan is due to DEFLATION over 30 years !
If this channel has taught me anything it is that nobody can predict the future, least of all economists.
Does the USA have an overinflated GDP given the amount of productive work output coming from institutionalized persons?  Interesting though from the most incarcerated population on earth…
One of the underestimated effects of feminism is birth rate collapse
Do uruguay next
TL/DR: Japan is a closed society! ;)
Please stop trying to make theft sound noble. The inflation plan is just the State and big businesses enriching themselfs by robbing the taxpayer.  If your economies growth is based on how much money you can print and get away with then this isn't growth... and also the reason why most countries measure their growth in their own currencies. Japan is as stagnent as most countries in the world, we just hide it better.
As someone who had the opportunity to go work in Japan and refused and went to the US instead I can tell you a lot of migrants even if they get opportunity to work in Japan they would refuse, for the reasons mentioned in the video
7:06 Golden kamuy in the background 😅
Housing in tokyo is only cheap if you work for a foreign company. Otherwise you will be living in a shoebox.
Canada is next for stagnation. Productivity has been stagnate  for decades and the federal government is addicted to temporary foreign workers to artificially inflate productivity. Companies have no inventive to modernize or develop technology
I think Japan also has an issue that their technology and economy are advanced but their culture hadn’t changed. Most of the laws and the culture favor older people, which puts burden on younger people so they have less children and focus less on their work. They aren’t heard and with little to no incentive to actually innovate or try to stand out and rock the boat.
Well, just attracting women to work full time killed the birth rate in all developed countries. Fewer children. Which means fewer future working people, that is, the wrong way to attract women to work , if your goal is more workers.
The question I am asking now is " how good is good enough? "
Wrong! Japan is ahead of it's time. All countries are going the same way country/Government suicide.
What is so “broken” about Japan that would make you, in all your concern, want to go and fix it?
Here goes some westerner asserting that something is wrong with Japan.
How with a declining population?
Don’t open the border. Stay strong and remain pure my eastern brothers.
Ironically, being the masters of efficiency, Japan has, in effect, abandoned their ability for innovation.
Better than being flooded with endless immigrants because
Brain drain is BS ask any economist
YOU ARE MY SPECIAL!!!!
I can't say how Japan is now days, but I lived there in 2004 - 2006 and I was dumbfounded by how advanced everything was. The toilets had automatic seat paper and seat warming. My Toyota had all-around crash detection before that was even a blip on America's radar. Computer parts were dirt cheap. I could get a heated can of coffee directly across the street my house from a vending machine before I went to work... and the locals were the friendliest and most honest I've met anywhere. When my daughter left her Gameboy on the bus, no one stole it. In fact, the bus driver tracked us down and brought it back to us! I miss it every single day, and I hope it doesn't change too much. As so many have already said, don't fix what ain't broke. Edit: Not that trolls deserve responses, but we were at a hotel when the Gameboy was returned. That's where the driver dropped us off at. Bonus story, I also accidentally left my camcorder on the top of my car at the aquarium and it was still there when we came out 90 minutes later. If that had happened in the USA, it would be knicked the second my back was turned.
I was almost surprised that I couldn't fill in my "Nobody can predict the future, least of all economists" Bingo square in this video, but I got it at the last minute. 😅
...bc they're racist AF. That's why
Surely Japanese housing is cheap as their birth rate is so low, without any immigration, which means less competition for existing stock
The video mostly talked about Japan's history and didn't say much at all about what changes are taking place.
Japan should default, imo.
Using population growth to grow your economy is the same as just borrowing more money and using that money to pay the intrest on the money you already borrowed.   The world is already far past the sustainable limit.
The quality of info graphics on this one is next level
There actually four ways to grow an economy. The two mentioned, and two others. One is modernization/industrialization that will attract foreign investment and make existing markets more efficient. This is basically what happened in China. The third way is to create new markets/technologies/services that did not exist before and monetize them. The Internet is an example of this and how it bolstered the American economy
Even though Japan might be stagnating, it's still light years ahead of most countries in the world. I think the "population crisis" will be solved by robots anyway in near future
Japan caught a falling knife in an attempting to stop deflation. They need to let the deflation happen.
I find it interesting that you conveniently left out the target for stimulus.
I found a way for japan to immediately pull itself out of this death spiral and its with anime girls, no I'm serious hear this;  Japan is known and loved by many people especially the "nerdy" clever ones and if they create and legalize a drug that makes people see anime girls they would %100 percent attract many very high skilled anime loving nerds into country!!  It's a win win too, Japan gets skilled workers, anime lovers get their waifus and the xenophobic people of japan don't get that aggravated because outsiders are not marrying their own people as much because... Well... They already have waifus!! :)
Japan has been silently shunned by the west because of their refusal to embrace multiculturalism.
Somebody has ChatGPTed "Honda Civic" and ended up with a CR-Z....
It’s definitely not the best and brightest that are showing up at the southern border of the US 😂 or in europe
Oh yes, just invite a bunch of immigrants, it totally doesn’t have any negative effects on society, or productivity, obviously, they’re just gonna be skilled workers and not a drain on the system, oh wait it turns out bring in a bunch of people to work for less brings down, wages, and stagnate, social, and financial mobility, resulting and bloat, bureaucracy and monopolization
I mean it won't matter much when the debt can't be paid...  They really 'oughta pick between Pre-WWI Deflationary economics (which they're halfway towards anyway) or just the standard Keynesian nonsense.
At what point was a Japanese company dominant in the smartphone market? What company was that? I can only think of Kyocera and Sony Ericsson but they were never a huge portion of the global market and Ericsson was an british company.
I recently saw a video from the 1960s about Japan where they mentioned Japan invests more back into their industry than any other nation in the world. Things really have changed. That said high salaries aren’t necessarily better if housing and other things are more expensive too. And how is quality of life better by buying a new iPhone or Mac each year? Or renovating the kitchen every few years despite it working fine. There are things in life more important than making as much money as possible and spend it on things you throw away in a year or two. And it’s kind of hard to celebrate that Japan has inflation when it’s hit us Europeans so hard. I just read about heating costs going up 30% in one year in a city where it is currently -43 centigrades. In that temperature heating isn’t a luxury. You’ll day pretty fast without it.
Economy and money is not everything. Japanese dont have equal rights, no fat people, no 20mil genders, little to no crime, no drugs and no drag quens at school telling kids its perfectly normal to cut their 🍆 off... Go Japan!
When people talk about Japan, they are always optimistic.  When people talk about China, they are satirically pessimistic.  This is despite their issues being very similar.  This is called BIAS, and those who take part in it will NEVER admit that they are biased.
I think Japan is purposefully not adopting all the technology it could, because in such a crowded society, there would be too many jobs displaced with no possible replacement and society would collapse without those jobs.  There would be too many mouths to feed and nobody to feed them and the social order would disintegrate.
Idk if Tokyo could even have zoning... it's a megacity so the typical city center > medium multi family houses > suburbs > satellite villages doesn't apply.
1:50 The importance of this kind of legislation should not be dismissed. After all, if criticizing government policies can land you in jail for years, how is anyone supposed to talk about problems in the society? The self-censorship practiced by the media should be a clear indication that something is seriously wrong. It shows that the government would rather shoot the messenger than hear the message.
at 8:14... I want to know which country is he the best and brightest of...
japan will be successful so long as there is a global shipping industry because jabap in such a strategic position for global shipping no matter where you are on the island your not far from the sea with accesses to the east the north and  the nearest point to the west besides siberia.
Hilarious BS Channel: quality of life is much better in Norway because each individual person is more productive compared to China. What a weird propaganda Channel is this?
Wait, you have to raise the price of goods domestically in order to sell them internationally?  Why?
There is a lot going right with japan but also a lot wrong as well. If the west could adopt Japan's philosophy about housing, the housing crises could be solved by eliminating most zoning laws in the and eliminating the view of housing as an investment. Easier said than done when everyone who already owns a house oviously doesn't want to lose their investment so that others can buy a home of their own.
Which country has Japan invested in more than any other in recent years?
Japan's main problem with attracting immigrants is also a language barrier it's not like france where language is mostly a cultural norm in japan japanese is a structural thing without which most people won't be able to function
GDP doesnt say anything about if an economy is healthy.
Think other countries should learn from those high inheritance tax rates. Cut down on nepotism and opulence.
local japanese still feel that the husband should work, and wife be a homemaker. that can be a big factor for low participation.
I can't handle the intonation at the end of your sentancessssss aaahahahahahahahaaa but the videos are good
I predict that it will take another 15 to 20 years for Japan to start working on rebuilding. It will be even longer before we see results.
An island with no major resources. They are doing exceptionally well
For Japan to be fixed, Godzilla must be slain!
The US may have superior GDP numbers,but that goes along with 31 trillion in debt.
Yeah I'm not buying the part of Japan falling behind in technology development.
Japan's problem is that the work ethic which brought them success is now throttling that success. The value a developing economy places on hard work and long hours simply doesn't transfer to an economy based on automation. "Worker" productivity is mostly machine productivity. When you continue to pretend long hours of work are still required of humans when they aren't, you pay for it with stagnation. Nowhere is that more obvious than in Japan.
I stopped the video when I realized I was listening to yet another YouTuber who speaks too fast for comfort.
So coming at it from a political science angle. A big oart if the problem hasn't just been economic. The 90's saw a lot of political as well as economic instability that might have done more to cause the lost decade that either the real estate bubble or the Asian financial crisis. Japan still suffers from political apathy and many of the other problems of that period, with political deadlock and dissatisfaction from the younger cohorts (not entirely unlike what you see in the US right now) still being factors.
13:05 I think 10,000Y is more like 70/80 USD.
Everybody understands that the population decline means every country must Adapt Or Die.  Nobody expected Japan to choose Die.
Just when I thought this video is ending without the quote ‘Nobody can predict the future least of all economists’ he said it at the end, lol
10k yen is like 70 USD , what is this guy talking about saying its 200 USD exchange?
Godzilla is awakening. Earthquakes, tsunami, planes crashing
@8:12 that guy is certainly typing like the best and brightest.
I live in Japan and work in Japan as a foreigner. Foreigners are everywhere now in Tokyo and elsewhere.. obviously still a small percentage ... but convienent stores have foreigners working there, unthinkable 15 years ago. I just don't agree with this video --- I have been trying to move from poorer asian countries all my life as a teacher. I made way more money in Vietnam and China, but I hated it there - pollution, government nonsense, loud, motorbikes, food safety being awful. I know this is an economics channel, but some things are hard to measure by money. Japan is special, it always has been, it attracts people in part for that reason. Of course the irony is, what we all love about Japan simply won't survive if tomorrow 10% or more of Japan were migrants. Japan is a great place, I make far less money, even considered poverty level in US, but I won't get shot, people follow the rules, and its ---- get this crazy idea ---- NICE.
The only way to give more Productivity is to have Digitized Economy with less investments in the Workforce enabled Markets but for Artificial Intelligence and IoT led Business Activities.
The biggest problem is looking at countries as economies rather than whole societies.  Even migrants who are screened based on economic productivity still create the social cancer of diversity.  They are often also disgusting, criminal, destructive, and ugly.  The negative externalities of migration are very rarely overcome by economic improvement in advanced economies.  This gets much worse, even to the point of genocidal evil, when migration is permitted to the point of mass migration.  Indeed it would take mass migration to move the GDP needle anyway.  So to advocate for migration as a policy for Japan is just you saying you want to destroy the Japanese people.
To say the houses here in Japan are lacking compared to developing countries is a dumb statement. Yes on average houses are smaller than the U.S., but it still has all the same qualities of those houses.
Japan being in the year 2000 since the 1970s and still being there is such a great phrase
Nitpicky car nerd here... At the point where cars are compared, the Honda showned is a CR-Z, not a Civic, and the Mercedes is a CLS, not a C Class. Maybe you put that in so nitpickers like me would make a comment and generate more engagement for the video 😅if so, well done, you got me !
10,000yen are about 70$ not 200$
U know u can fix japan's problem by freeing it from US millitary occupation right??
Something weird is happening in Japan..... the answer is hentai
if japan's 3 lost decades isn't a failure, idk what failure is.
To our Japanese Brothers and Sisters, please look at it in a different perspective. Yes Japans economy is performing well despite stagnation and the quality of living is still good. However, for how long will this last?   For a low birth rate country, where are you going to find workers or employees? In an ever changing world, will you just stop innovating?   I love how rich Japan is in culture and resources, but not economic mindset.  I guess I will be making business with Chinese or Americans here in the Philippines in the future lol.
Japan is that gifted kid that grew up only to fall behind their peers.
Never forget this a westerners bias perspective. I’d love to see a video about the degradation of canada and see if you describe it like you describe Japan
In what world is 10000yen worth $200USD in 2024?
Grow occurs when you economy is putting people to work in jobs they are relatively happy at, can do well, and they get to decide how to spend some of their money on what they want without the state getting involved.   Japan went into a woke period before we did, this can be detected by low birth rates.   As Japanese are normal people and do not like failure they are getting out of it.
Demographics, demographics, demographics.
Outstanding amounts of verbal diahorrea
I live and study in Osaka, and I heard houses here are so cheap also because they're built to be replaced after 20 years since the country is known to have so many natural disasters. So why view a house as an investment when you might need to replace it in a couple years? Although, I heard the price of the land holds value depending on the area.
This should not have been a surprise to ANYBODY. Why is there such a mass delusion that economies can just magically keep growing infinitely, and that trying to make this happen is a good idea? Nothing can grow infinitely in the real world, and only a fool would make their future success permanently dependent on a phenomenon that can only ever be temporary.
JUST FOCUS ON THE BIBLE:   ADAM & EVE IS 6,000 YEARS TO NOW   THEN, MESSIAH RULES FROM JERUSALEM FOR ANOTHER 1,000 YEARS  THEN, HE CREATES A NEW HEAVEN & EARTH   BORN-AGAIN GO TO HEAVEN  IT IS FREE LIFE INSURANCE    AMEN !!!!
Migration hasn't been doing very well in EU countries. I think assimilating is very important when it comes to immigration. Japan wouldn't be Japan if not for the Japanese.
😯🇯🇵 is occupied by 🇺🇲‼️😁😁😁😁😝
The 2000s were the best era, so that really doesn’t sound bad.
"How it's handling housing affordability"? lol, from my experience living in Japan for the past 12 years I have NOT seen any "handling" of it in anything approaching a positive light.
With mass migration  does not equal to Skilled Migrants. Just more headaches 😂
Economic models seem increasingly toylike in a complicated world leaving economists to say 'something weird is happening' or 'its an exogenous shock' are they at the same moment physicists were at when the newtonian 'clockwork universe' model broke down in the light of experiments that gave rise to the quantum theory hypothesis (i.e. what you're seeing is a projectiion of the model onto the observation)
at least japan is not ravaged by horrible housing prices
@economicsexplained would you be able to look into the disconnect with companies seeking endless gains while the average wage earner has their necessities met already? A staggering percentage of average Americans can’t afford basic necessities and most of that is due to speculative markets and endless profiteering. Is there a metric that shows what necessities an average American wants and when that spending stops?
Japan got ritch for no reason Argentna got poor for no reason
While the Japanese ARE very conservative, they have also had two big off-setting characteristics as a nation: -They are extremely team-driven. They have a sense of greater-good and need to work in groups that is staggering compared to a more independent/me-first attitude like America. Neither is "bad" as such, but it gives them a real edge in complex operations with lots of moving parts like an industrial economy. -They have an almost fetish for precision. There is real pride (or shame) in not making something as good as you possibly can, and taking care of the tools that make it. It shows up in their art, their manufacturing, everything. Definitely a big advantage over China, where the mantra is more like "fake it until you make it".
The US nuked Japan's economy with the Plaza Accord.
Props to the happy yakuza at 17:16. What WAS he smiling about?
No one ever mentions the godzilla attacks and how that has had major negative effects on the Japanese economy.
Small (but cozy and well designed) house, no car (because public transport is so good), standard of living is improving very slowly (but it is already high). Ah the horror! Think of the GDP!  Although they of course have real serious problems with sitting in offices whole days (while doing comparative work as 40hr a week Westerners) and ultra low birth rates (less that 2.1 would be fine, but it's not slow decline it's a collapse).
I think it is unfair the comparison between China's GDP and Japan. For a country with such a small population as Japan, they are doing an amazing job with what they have.
Telling perspective on Japan/Japanese in one video. Thanks!
Krugman also said the internet wouldn't have a greater effect on the economy than the fax machine.
Japan sits in the ring of fire 🔥 nothing can “save it”.
State secrecy law. Newspapers afraid to criticize the government. Talk about burying the lead!
"""migrants""" invad1ng europe: "what does work mean? Glory to sky god!" 🤡
With a declining population, they have absolutely no chance to grow their economy.
lol keep beleiveing the western narritve. House price going down, low inflation, safe, high living standards. The mass immgration is not the solution. The west has fallen.
My mentor once told me, "If it's not growing, It's dying"
To understand the economy in Japan you can’t go by a series of garbage numbers; you must go by the Japanese three-tier system of the economy. Your commentary is based on the first tier; or statistical data of available on corporations registered with Nippon Data bank and GDP forecasts. That’s a very small icing on the cake level of corporate Japan. The second level is the 中小企業(Chushoukigyou medium & smaller registered companies) which most are not accurately detailed as far as data on economic status is not available to the public. By far this base is huge and forms the underlying cushion of economic movement supporting the first tier. The third tier is the massive “missing economy” of the under or un-reported roots economy including forestry, agriculture, fisheries, and base line support industries which there is no way of gathering true data on these financial factors. The 黒幕 (black curtain government) is and has been the whole backing of this level of society and in whole has worked this way for generations by maintaining society with the use of cash. Massive amounts of cash run through the veins of the unreported blood that keeps the economy from any serious interruptions. The Japanese economy for foreigners (and yes average Japanese) is designed this way for the purpose and a reason to protect itself; it works beautifully. Lastly, the comment of media does not post negative statements about the government for fear of censorship shows you do not know how Japan works; the government does not censorship anything as they don’t need to. People don’t care as the ship moves through the night and they can sleep well as they know they will wake up in the morning without fear.
how many homeless people do u have in UR country? we don't depend on government handouts, im sure UR race will get worse then us with all those unskiled immigrant.
Its a funny old place Japan.
bullshit
As intelligent, rational and data based it is, something odd and off this video is. Some statistics and notions about Japan are also somewhat too old and/or too typical, making some quire contrast with the latest Japanese image video in background... too smart to really come see the country with his own eyes and experience ?
How would a nation pivot to an economy *not* based on growth?  The moment that every family is provided for in basic and higher needs is the moment you don't need growth anymore. Then you can focus on other tasks like reducing pollution or increasing happiness.
Can Japan be fixed ? it would be hard but Yes ! Can US  be fixed ? it would be super hard but Yes (unless in 2024 doesn't end with a change) ! Can UK , Spain , Germany , France , etc  be fixed ? NO , too late !
"Something Weird Is Happening In Japan" - do you have any idea how little that narrows it down?
Growth is often just a way for corrupt people to milk the system. Less and less things work as they should because GROWTH is a false god. People don't need competence, skill or accountability. Quantity over quality. The waste of resources becomes enormous and injustice will become the norm. It's like giving normies any power whatsoever - you really shouldn't.
BUT THE TOKYO SWAMP HERE CONTINUES TO PRINTING PAPER MONEY AND RAISE TAXES, WHILE NOT OPENING THE COAL PLANT OFF THE NAGASAKI COAST NOR RE-OPEN SOME NUKE FACILITIES..NOT TO MENTION NOT DRILLING OFF THE SENKAKUS FOR OIL FOR THE GREEN NEW FRAUD.  JAPAN WILL BECOME THE NEW PERONIST-ERA ARGENTINA.  REMEMBER MY PREDICTION.
It’s called natural disaster.
Perpetual economic growth is a fantasy, this why the neoliberal framing of "line on graph go up" is either a delusion or a lie depending on who is purveying it. Japan's current economy won't collapse, but the economies of the West will.
The US has the most advanced economy in the world.
Ah, I reckon I know where you worked mate. You are ex-Treasury (not RBA or private sector) - I recognise Ken Henry's "3Ps" framework (I did a lot of work on that once). The limitation of the framework is that the identity "Output = Productivity x Population x Participation" encourages people to think the three dependent variables are orthogonal whereas they are actually highly interdependent in complex ways - and this matters. The first half of this post flirts with this trap a bit. The housing stuff is very good though. Though maybe point out that cheap housing is a lot easier to do - in fact inevitable - when your population is shrinking quickly.
One of the most notable things about Japan is the social stability. Everyone "knows their role", hierarchical coordination is assumed and all sorts of transactions are standardized around a norm instead of requiring negotiation, all of which adds to the convenience of it as a visitor and produces positive results in the frequent earthquake and flood disasters. The society makes the fundamental assumption that everyone is everyone else's parent and can be brought back into line with a stern talking-to, before involving any official rules. It has advantages and disadvantages.  But I think that also goes a long way to explain the economy, too. When the hierarchy falls into place so readily, the nation will compete to the extent that it's provoked to do so, and then idle, because there won't be internal motives to "shake things up" and destabilize the established power structure and norms. That would be disharmonious.
Japan still is a bit poor per capita, lower GDP per capita than Israel or Germany
GDP is the most irrelevant stat that governments are obsessed with. People care about how safe and clean the streets are, homelessness, crime rate, house and rent price. Japan kept its culture and identity and avoided the immigration obsession that has plagued the UK, France, Germany and Sweden. As a result, their GDP may not be as high, but their women are not being rapped in abundance by African and Arab migrants.
living in the early 2000 doesnt sound so bad compared to now.
Doubling the workforce when women were encouraged to work lowered incomes per person and resulted in lower birth rates. It increased profits for the elites. Money only flows upwards.  Short term benefits at the expense of long term benefits.
Did not mention how Japan stimulated certain industries using so-called “war-time economics” which led to the Japanese industrial boom in the 70s’. Also, didn't mention how engineered overstimulation of housing and banking and engineering the move to the “free market economy” created a bubble “crisis” that destroyed consumer confidence for the following 30 years.  The video lacks the core facts.🤝
Would be interesting to see how Japans wealth is distributed across the country and how quality of life differs between regions. Although Tokyo might be a shoe box, I have heard people get big properties elsewhere.
Why have any kids if inheritance tax is even over 0.1%? The answer is you don’t!
Something tells me Germany is next when it comes to Stagnation. Also not very innovative and very conservative, crazy beaucracy and losing it's technological edge for serveral reasons as well.
Its a sad world where counties need to replace their population with other nations to keep the state alive
Japan is Bound to fall, they're the greatest dummy test for western country
Only if they unite with china
I think Japan was and is doing well. They're considered lagging since the rest of the world is in a race which isn't sustainable. The problem is the other worlds superpowers here. Japan does have its fair share of problems like low birthrates, over working people, not really immigration friendly etc. But it's still fine and better off than other countries, even my own.
Interestingly the situation in Japan is fairly normal for the nation. If you look at Japanese history in aggregate, a pattern emerges. Japan tends to stagnate in technology for decades or centuries until something dramatic happens and they rapidly modernize often far faster than anyone else in the world, before stagnating again. The best example of this is the stagnation under the Tokugawa shogunate and then rapid modernization into the Empire of Japan, where Japan got stuck in 1925 until 1945 at the end of WW2. Then they rapidly modernized again and now are stuck again. I suspect here in anothet couple decades something will happen and Japan will again rapidly modernize getting to the bleeding edge before stagnating again.
"Productivity" is a very ideological term for the value added. I think nobody is more industrious than the people working their lives away in the mines and on the fields, however, anybody with a laptop job in a developed economy can sell they product or service at a much higher price. Are the Norwegians way more productive than the Chinese? I doubt it. I guess they just have the advantage of being overwhelmingly employed in industries with very high value-added (for whatever reason) or they are just lucky due to oil (worker productivity is presumably an average metric, so if some economic sector gets in lots of revenue, I assume that it influences this metric).
Another video about Japan and growth from from a western lense. But have you actually been there? Do you understand the culture? I'm not sure if you understand the mentality in Japan. It's very(!) different from our own. So talking about growth for the growth's sake doesn't really make so much sense. And what is growth excactly? A blown up valuation of a company or GDP? By the way; Where does well-being and happiness come into all of this growth? In Bhutan for example, they measure their GDP in happiness and not money.
What does this mean? Japan has far cleaner and safer cities, better airports, roads, healrhcare, and they do better in school, live longer, etc. Than " growing" USA
Hey Youtuber With a degree in economics obtained with candy coupons🤷😂women have to work for intellectual honesty because from the point of view of salary and position they should protest and Don't go to work.
I know someone from my country (Vietnam) who was recruited to work in Japan because he was a genius. But when he was there no one took him seriously because he came from a “less-developed” country. He ended up going back home and the recruiter was very upset but he couldn’t do anything about Japan’s corporate culture.  The Nissan CEO being purged and had to make a daring escape is another example. That’s how inefficient old Japanese are and why they’re stuck in the past.
Szoguny
Mass migration is a sure fire way to cause your country to devolve into conflict.  There's a reason these people come from multiple DIFFERENT countries in the first place. Culture clash causes conflict. As the entirety of human history shows, it can get quite violent.  The whole reason countries became countries is because people didn't want to live with other peoples who didn't share their values and thoughts on how their society should be run.  It's also littered with cultures wholesale replacing the ones that were there before.
Excellent explanation of real estate
Norway has the benefit of oil, so it isn't simply a case of their people being more productive than the Chinese. If you took away their oil, the standard of living would go down.
Does it need to be "fixed"?  Can the Japanese just enjoy their country, decline in population, and be the most advanced automated society?
I don't understand why you state Japan has had every reason to fail economically. It is one of the most diversified economies in the world with global multinationals leading in every market, specially those with high barriers of entry. Japanese products are some of the most refined high quality at reasonable prices, specially in cars. The only reason Japan has failed during all these decades has been a terrible mismanagement of monetary and fiscal policy, thats it.
Japan playing end game content for the last 20 years
I don't know man. Apart from corporate culture it feels like we are in the wrong here.
Win Bulshit
Oh right all of those millions of migrants that cross the border in the US and Europe are engineers, doctors, etc.. That’s a joke right? Maybe look at the actual data. Most migrants are low skilled, low paid workers that suppress wages. On top of that they are a net negative as they cost more.
No ranking?
The higher the gaslight, the bigger the fall from grace 😂
Japan needs to fix its demographic problem. If Japan wants to stay Japanese while doing so there really is only one way to go about doing that - the indigenous Japanese of age  have to start having children at replacement level again. They’ll take a hit to the total population for a generation or two, therefore quality of life, but they could come back. In the West we have our heads firmly up our backsides about demographics and about growth. We‘re practicing the economics of decline because most of us in the chattering class fancy ourselves as permanently affluent and are therefore too comfortable to want to upset the apple cart. That’s a nice delusion to have until it isn’t any more. The Japanese are ahead of the curve as far as economic decline due to demographics is concerned. In the West we decided to emulate them in that regard. The panacea being the mythical qualified economic migrant. The best case scenario would be a perpetual brain drain at the cost of most of the rest of the world. Not exactly sustainable. The reality is very different of course and soon enough all the shibboleths about quality of life etc will no longer apply to Western European States for very obvious reasons. Then we’ll have a lot of videos telling us how obvious that is, after the fact.
You forgot the US forcing Japan to sign the Plaza Accord, significantly increasing the value of the yen
Have not enjoyed Ground News, feel it's been a waste, just sharing my experience, won't be renewing
genius
Japan is an incredibly racist country  Thats why they’re stagnating i have no sympathy for them
"Japan is a country that has been living in the 2000s since the 1970s, ahead of its time then and way behind now" haha perfect quote to describe the country.
I knew something was wrong when every restaurant in Japan still uses pen and paper to keep track of guests waiting to be seated when plenty of POS exists.
Fix yourself first, then look towards other countries. Japan is ok, it's a strong enough economy, firm democracy and healthy nation
I would attest that your quality of life section was subjective and unfortunately wrong on many accounts.   Quality of life can be measured in many things - for example, crime rate, cleanliness, quality of food, government services, community life, festivals, holidays and more. The one that you can clearly compare with other countries is the crime rate - it is way safer and more secure to raise a family and even be a pensioner in Japan compared to all other advanced economies.    The quality and style of food also is genuinely one of the best in the world. You can also compare this by using obesity levels and life expectancy (combined with the healthcare system).   Japan does have a few issues, some of them long standing, but quality of life is not one of them. :)
I live in Tokyo - you were spot on about the inheritance tax, my friends mention it often how much of a burden it is
Paul Kurgman, the most imbecile economist of modern times
USA screwd Japan hard time
god I hope Japan doesn't fall the immigration trap, destroying their civilization for a few points of gdp to suit some investors..
Average wages need to incorporate that many over 65s still work in Japan (and there are a whole lot of over 65s). This can often be low pay and/or part time work, skewing the median and average. There are many reports of not enough young employees to hire, so such competition is helping bid up their wages.
Japan people are disciplined and not a burden on the state
Japan simply focuses on what is important, UTILITY is way better than NETWORTH. I mean, think about it for a second, is Tesla more beneficial to humanity than Toyota?? Ofcourse not, yet Tesla has a higher Networth than Toyota.  We have alot to learn from Japan. It is the utility that matters not what the ultra rich think something is worth
"Japanese live in tiny homes" - as an American, I notice the word "homes", as in "not tents next to a highway on ramp".
sorry, standard of living, is waaaay lower in western europe n us compared to japan
I wonder if Carlos Ghosn would recommend moving to Japan to take up an employment opportunity?
... i mean yeah infinite growth is BS and always has been. There will be a limit for each technological step.
How successful was Japan?  They havd stagnated for decades but their working class still enjoys one of the highest standards of living in the world
Year 2000, exactly. I've worked at the same place in Kyoto for 16 years and it's still "fax this" or "can you make a DVD?" Ridiculous. The healthcare system, best in the world public transportation, lack of guns and Jesus freaks, among other things, will keep me here forever.
They need Diversity forced upon them like they do it on the West. Imagine a million black people there. Grab the popcorn and watch diversity work it's magic.
I am in Japan now and it does not super efficient. For example you apply for a job being very clear that your Japanese is weak, but they still invite to the interview, take all the details just to say that your Japanese is not good enough and asks reapply once it improves a bit. Efficiency could improve a bit, but other than that, this country has tremendeous potential and it's perfect for investment because everything is so cheap.
EE really hammers those stock videos!
japan peaked late 80s will never bounce back. declining population   negative interest rates. Unions dont have enough power in japan so they can strike for better wages. also japan now has to compete with other countries.
Japan will sink in the ocean so even if they can save their economy it wouldn't matter.
Everybody who has been to Japan will find it to be the best functioning country in the world.
Pushing the limits becoming the norm also means that a lot of other extreme things become the norm. That's just what it is. Don't blame the overworked for saving up money
No new innovation, too much formalities and paperwork imo..
7:55 you'd beter study the amounts of migration to Russia from the Stans in the south. According to the map it's zero and this is conplete BS.
Ugh, I missed it - what is the 'something weird'?
thats a fuckin honda crz not a civic
Interesting Video,  but you cant really compare Apple and Microsoft with other Companies to be fair.  The Stock footage is also a bit much imho.
Hmmm, lots missed here. More of an opinion piece but thank you.
Maybe I’ll write why when I feel like, but this guy’s view is very stereotypic.
Economists are liars.  Statisticians are liars.  A falling population is only good for the people, not bad.  Cheaper real estate, more space and living space.  Lovely thing.
Well. Japan has not gone to war to boost it industry like how that is the main export of the US.
I would be worried if nothing weird was happening. 988
This is a cacophony of misinfomation and misunderstandings. US-centric thinking focusing on the eroneous "GDP paradym", a lack of understanding of the social context of economics and a poor understanding of monetary theory and its historical evolution (500 years of history) are a few of the areas this video and this channel falls down on. Economics explained simply doesn't understand economics. For those currious simply research the cost of living in Japan, compare that to the median salary (including benefits) and you can see quite clearly the standard of living is well ahead of the west. Alternatively visit the country, forgetting what you've read online and see what you think for yourself. Japan itsn't going to see GDP growth for a very long time. In the 2040s the yen will strengthen again, and as if by magic it will be one of the most advanced economies in the world (with GDP to boot), despite 50 years of "stagnation" by then.

My opinion: I guess everyone will kinda plateau in the end?
Great video. But actually I'm quite new to this channel so I really didn't get that what did change during COVID that is affecting the status que of Japan.
Great video! Thanks for the shoutout mate!
The quality of life in the USA is horrible, but somehow they've been able to convince the world's smartest people to want to come here
Argentina has failed because of the MIC.
Would be interesting to see how Japans wealth is distributed across the country and how quality of life differs between regions. Although Tokyo might be a shoe box, I have heard people get big properties elsewhere.
Umm, I was one of the guys made the material for state secrecy law back in 2012-2013(one of the underpaid interns at consulting firm), law doesn’t really have any authority to sensor media… just say’n.
Is no one going to mention the fact that Japans government is essentially a cartel that’s been in power for 40 years?! Probably the single most important factor and it’s just not mentioned at all?
There is no reason to expect infinite growth in any economy. If the standard of living of the people is good and the socio-economic situation is good, you have everything you need from the economy. Infinite growth is only required for infinite corruption in the government with corrupt corporations that want people to spend all their income on things they don't need to pay even more taxes.
You mean apart from the earthquake right now? I do seem to remember Japan saying they could support themselves in 2011 but could not after the meltdowns.
Imported workers cause displacement and wage competition, so comparing it to the unworking population is wrong when it can be the cause of it.
7:06 -7:24. This is Australia's answer to GDP growth. Successive governments have done this for decades including the current government, breaking immigration records all the while investing little in critical infrastructure to support the population growth. NET OUTCOME? Continued degradation of living standards and rising inequality and homelessness. What a place to be. SMH
Yea "best and brightest" aren't the people coming over on foot and "small bots" now, these are the dregs.
I think Japan is in a prime spot for the switch to robots.... aging population, shortage of workers.
what an awful summary of the situation. 😂 the japanese quality of life is top of the chart globally, and cost of living is highly affordable. health and safety are unparalleled globally. your incessant return to ideas of "growth" and "recovery" are silly -- totally misplaced here. japan won. they won the human race! there's nothing left to do but pour more time and money into science for the benefit of all the world. this is what a right-sized economy that takes care of its people looks like. the cultural artifacts that burden them (like useless overworking) are silly flourishes. hardly problematic compared to, say, american cultural dead weight practices such as ridiculously long and polluting commute times.   it's genuinely sad and baffling to watch you assess the japanese economy in this way. you did not mention pollution, obesity, health, longevity, commute times, or any of a dozen variables that put japan at the forefront of comfortable, safe, sustainable human experience. absolute madness to talk for 19 minutes in this way! 😂
In countries like Australia we can 100% build a lot more basic apartment buildings while still being a decent size. The middle ground is always right
Only one bothered by calling a CRZ a civic 😅 and a s-class a c-class
The author of this video is very far left
The real issue with Japan is this: every time they seem to be getting their footing and experiencing solid GDP growth and a healthy birth rate, a kaiju shows up and smashes half of Tokyo. They are dealing with a shortage of Oxygen Destroyers and hence this problem won't be solved anytime soon.
As someone who's lived in Japan for more than 20 years I can say Tokyo housing is NOT CHEAP unless you live in a literal shoebox. Outside of Tokyo is a different story
There are four economies in the world 🌎.. Close to America second closest to America third closest and forth closest to America.. and made to barks woof woof by America.. or being like china that owns it's own dogs 🐕 🙄...
@ecomics explained. Great vid man! Got notifications as soon as you upload 🎉.  Lets not forget that in Japanese business culture, managers and leaders rarely listen and have huge egos. The criminal system is corrupted with conviction rate is 100%. These two factors decrease motivation and increase less feedback loop, which creates less good products and company culture.
Something people of the West do not understand at a fundamental level is that China Korea and Japan are ancient cultures. An ancient culture is thousands of years old and has survived much more and longer than 90% of the countries in the world. This means that these cultures, regardless of recent setbacks and ideas of modern times, will always be able to rely on the traditions and culture they built for longer than 20 times the existence of some countries.  So, when analyzing ancient cultures, their history, tradition, and tendencies tend to matter a lot more than contemporary trends.   Japan's style of UNCHANGE is not recent. It happened since the days of the early feudal era where the nobles did not want the peasants to rise up, so they created a system where they gave a lot of pride and prestige to craftsmen and lower class workers so that commoners start to take pride in what they do and not try to change their station in life.  This is the polar opposite of Korea where they came up with the concept of meritocracy eons before the west did and so climbing the social ladder and changing their status is baked into their culture.  Now with this information as the foundation, if you look at how these two countries are behaving now, you can see that they are acting exactly in the same way they did thousands of years ago.  Japan still has craftspeople and old people honing their craft and passing it down for generations in the countryside while the politicians, the culture, the way of life, business practices, NOTHING changes. Whereas South Korea will not stop advancing, adapting, changing, and perfecting, always driving for the top while abandoning traditions and culture along the way.
japan is for the japaneese.
One can talk forever about their stagnation but if you really know japan you would know they have a very high quality of life and not having inflation is amazing.
To defivitely say that there is a limit to growth is foolish. There is no apparent limit to growth, since the size of the universe is unknown. The only limiting factor to growth is society's willness to adapt to an ever changing environment and to advance rapidly.
World developed they don't need as much Japanese stuff...  China eaten Japan and Korea to.... 😂
Japan’s main income is the marketing of delicious Japanese men and their holes
Another interesting point is that culturally, Japanese people do not like "used" goods, specifically here, "used" houses. If you buy a house, you want to buy a brand new house, not a house someone else has used, which adds to the factor that people do not buy homes with the intent that they will sell them higher later.
Its not so bad right now being here. Houses are still very cheap and unemployment is very low. Food is cheap and healthy. Compared to back in Canada, my life is really easy here
I don't think Japan welcome immigrants to stay , given their restrictive policy on permanent residency
On another point the housing bubble seems very similar to what is happening in Canada the USA and other developed countries it may be our turn to face the Asian Financial Crisis of housing, Japan has a distinct advantage in it's stagflation as a relative cheap affordable alternative with lower risk of downside growth and more upside potential. I give Japan an 8/10 on the development index and 10/10 on the potential recovery
Kind of disagree, the quality of life is incredible just not as a worker, the transit system is superior and the housing is affordable. Econ gets it wrong in that it may not be a good economy to work in but it's a great overall economy to live in, and a plus is their debt is nationally owned. So it's actually a really interesting place to live in if you have the income to be a skilled migrant with casual free time to enjoy the amenities a developed country has to offer on the side. Such as hot spring hotels, live concerts, skiing on mountains or tropical islands at a reasonable price, anime and manga conventions, cool cafes and studios it has a lot going for it that are intangible benefits outside of the economic calculation and into the cultural ones. Including no tipping, friendly non woke people, and great customer service where you can rent a 5 star hotel with electric onsens and cold baths cheaply or a manga hotel, or a capsule you get variety. Can go to an all exclusive ryokan on the other end and be treated with world class dishes from a master chef lot of choices and with the yen at low rates one needs to look at the economic purchasing power of bring foreign money in :) So 100% Yes this is a great place to earn US dollars and spend Yen.
Most young japanese don’t work all they do is walking around town enjoying life
Young people will have the reigns soon and young people tend to be more progressive on these sorts of things
So, companies apologize for price rises, but not shitty labor practices?
"Japan is the country that has been living in the year 2000 since the 1970's" holy...... this is the best quote to describe a country
Okay, yes. But I can walk down the street at night without getting mugged in Japan. Game. Set. Match.
One word, Demographics. They will lose half their population in the next 50-75 years. So will South Korea and China. Europe wont be farm behind. You can make all the high teck stuff you want, but if no one is there to use it it wont matter.
Obv this is a Chinese channel
I've been watching this channel since 2021 They are still making fun of Argentina😂
You've missed that Japan's employment laws basically prevents firing employees who don't produce, and COULD produce in a different job. I work for a Japanese company and they throw labor at the most simple and automateable tasks because they can't shed nonperforming employees by law. The flawed idea of lifetime employment has clipped the wings of the Asian juggernaut.
best country in the world wish i could live there
why isn't Japanese villified as racist for not accpeting anyone who DOESN"T do well in a Japanese test but Australia is the devil incarnate for making people do an  European language test to enter the country?
By the second half of the century, something like 60% of Japanese will be over 65.  What growth?1  Krugman is wrong about productivity.  In the long run, it is the BIRTH RATE that's everything.  By putting women into the workforce and making it unprofitable to have children, industrialized nations the world over have eaten the seed corn.  Now, inevitably, comes the famine.  And after, shall come the collapse.
⭐
68% - 63% is NOT a ‘5%’ change. It is a 7.3% change. (5/63)
Dumping on Japan in the Ground News ad is not a classy move.  If you want to criticize something, at least try to do it at least a fiction of impartiality or propriety.
Limitless growth is not a question for economists. It's a question for technologists.  Fiddle with economic policy all you like. Growth requires increasing output. There are two ways to get more output: add people, or improve productivity. Population in advanced countries like Japan are stagnating. Increasing productivity is all that's left, and that's 100% a technology question.  Whatever your view of it, tech is advancing, particularly AI and robotics. Fewer people will be needed to produce more. How much, how fast is a technology question.  There is an economics question to answer, though: as productivity rises, jobs will be destroyed. (It's only a productivity gain if more jobs are destroyed than created.) As productivity rises, the primary means of downward wealth distribution will wither. Absent meaningful interventions, wealth concentration will rise. And so will poverty.  Robotics and AI could usher in a new age of plenty. It could also produce dystopia. The key will be whether we are able to reimagine how an economy should work, given these powerful new tools.
The human raise is leading to extinction
Beautifully done until the very end when Paul Krugman was mentioned. I can't imagine having a quality channel such as this while having any shred of reverence for a hack such as Krugman.
This is just degrowth at it's core. In many ways heightened technology will help produce surplus for less people. Which means overall "degrowth of GDP" but a growth of per capita/per person GDP.
Why must we all be so focused on growth? Why not focus on improving lives and living on the planet in a sustainable manner and actually enjoying life??
As a Japanese-Australian it's really obvious to me how throughout my life Australia has progressed while Japan has been frozen in time and i've also noticed that every Japanese person I speak to has an incredibly pessimistic view of the future of the country.
Your mobile phone analogy is flawed since most ALL mobile phones as well as PC contains parts like camera, quartz timer and various other parts are dominated by Japanese companies. Same with various other industries. Airliner grade Carbon composite material are 70% Japan. You can find various components just like this.
All the "free" productive workers from immigration is nice in the instantaneous scope, but it means certain markets (labour being the most obvious) get distorted, and also that society as a whole places less emphasis on self-sustainability because the normal relationship of actions to consequences falls part, which is kind of terrible in the long run. And that's without going into the right-wingy, identity side of things, which has a bad rap for very good reasons but at the end of the day we ARE still a bit of a tribal species no matter what we try to do socially, and culture clashes WILL happen.
a lot of it has to do with the US changing a lot of business to china because it’s cheaper
No Japan does not need to take in immigrants especially from incompatible cultures, purely in the name of GDP. I'm sure many Japanese like Japan the way it is, modern yet retaining its unique identity and culture.
Poor, poor timing with the recent tragedies the country has gone through already in 2024. Disrespectful.
Its not that Japan is doing bad, its just people having unrealistic expectations of Japan based on their past success.
Why do we need more growth of GDP, most people’s life in developed world are already good enough, reducing GDP maybe a better option to environment….
I spent a year in Japan in 2009/10. GDP growth is nonsense. As a person, there was nothing you could really want for; if someone said Japan will stay as it is forever, most Japanese and the few others in Japan would be intensely relaxed.
The zoning in Tokyo is really fascinating. Just walking around it feels so alive and integrated. Even in residential areas you’ll find shops, and in busy areas you’ll find quiet residential houses. I personally love the atmosphere and convenience of Tokyo.
It’s funny that he says that the State Secrecy Law gives the Japanese media a fear of censorship. The law is nothing about censorship. The reason why the Japanese media are not good news resources is genuinely because they are not very capable😂.
WeWork had an effect on its economy as well.
The way we work is also a big problem ... fueled by an outdated education system that is designed to make good factory workers than fostering creative collaboration or nurturing innovative disruptors. There are a lot of problems here and very few local people notice these issues and want to make changes. Try working at a traditional Japanese company ... makes you want to bang your head on a wall for so many reasons ...
All cos old farts company owners.
1:57 This is straight up false. Not only does the Japanese news regularly criticize the government but the “state secrecy” law concerns safeguarding military intelligence and is still pretty lax compared to similar laws in the US. It has nothing to do with criticizing the government. Misinformation like that harms your channel’s credibility.
Japan does have an interesting economy, but I am sure they can figure it out.
Why is the monthly wages chart so spiky at 14:34? Annual and bi-annual bonuses?
Oh how I wish 10,000yen was worth $200! It's worth more like $70 right now.
Do one on Georgism / LVT already, you cowards!
Japan is awesome.
japans economy survived the shibyua incident
So many things already happening in Japan this year 😮
Please stop dragging out the last syllable of the last word of every sentence.  Other than that, great stuff. Thumbs up.
Also foreign worked numbers are way up. I visited last year after living there for a years a while back and the change after a decade was dramatic.
interesting
You keep on saying how immigration is good for a country receiving immigrants. However, it is not good if such immigration is being used as a band aid on a country whose population is dying out. You economists seem to like to treat symptoms rather than the root cause. One thing, you continually avoid is why are modern societies dying out - what is it about them that makes them no longer viable. Such "societies" are having not just fewer children, but also fewer marriages and people are becoming just individuals - I don't see this trend changing.
Japan is the world's crucible for accommodating extreme population aging.
Hours worked in USA and JP is almost the same https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_annual_labor_hours
Japan's gonna do fine in the long run.  I, for a long time, thought that Japan was not a resource-rich nation, but upon reflection, Japan, due to its rainy season and dams, will not suffer from lack of water.  We are also very mountainous, so the terrain serves as a natural water purifier.  (Our ability to dig huge holes in the mountains is very sound and advanced as well, so we can gain more livable space not by cutting down mountains, but digging underheath them.)  We are also located in a very sweet spot in terms of latitude on earth, while also stretching north and south geographically meaning we have climatic diversity within the nation, all meaning that we will be better able to cope with whatever climate change brings us.  We are also an island nation, meaning it is far easier to control migration and also protect ourselves from external aggression.  And while we have not done so yet, we will be able to excavate the resources (such as natural gas) in the ocean beds.  So purely based on our geographic location, we are going to do fine, where other nations will not.   And the fact that we did not incorporate automation at the speed that we could meant that the older generation were able to keep on working and maintain their social status until they retired out.  Japan can and will automate at an adequate and humane pace to replace lost human resources.   Sure Japan's population is projected to be one-third of its peak in 75-years and be around 40 million, but that means it goes back to its population number of 1910.  And that's still more than the current population of Canada or Australia.  So what's the problem?  By then, we will truly be living in an IoT society anyway.
We shouldn't forget that Japan, as an island nation, was also an isolationist country, until the US forced them to open their ports. Their culture is insular because they just want to be left alone for the most part. I doubt the Japanese will move overseas for better opportunities unless they send their children abroad.
Thank you for your work and happy new year!❤
Only if you take away the Japanese women’s rights. Then their replacement rate will be normal. Same for South Korea. Feminism is the reason for the low birth rates
While it's true that the wages of Japanese workers has stagnated over the years, so have the wages of Australians and many other nations, but the difference here is that Japan had low inflation so that lack of wage growth was not as bad comparatively. This is similar with GDP, it's again true that the Japanese economy has been stagnant but GDP per capita has grown by about as much as most developed nations and more than some other developed nations.  Japanese overworking is also misunderstood. It's true that it happens but it's not the norm, on average the Japanese actually work fewer hours per year than the US and Australia do.
Forgot to mention how Japanese government intentionally sacrifice the aging population (that became burden to the economy) by refusing covid lockdown, aggressive tracing, and massively under report cases
I think this is a very poorly timed scheduled release
I am speaking from the perspective of a quasi-outsider as someone who has been to Japan for prolonged periods and has friends who have lived in Japan in the past, but part of the problem is that Japan doesn't WANT migrants. They love tourists but they don't want outsiders coming and setting up permanent residence in their home. I was only ever treated well because I was very visibly an outsider and spoke broken Japanese but Americans I've known who've lived there for more than a year report a different experience with neighbors and coworkers.
is it weird that i really want japan to recover to its glory like back in the 90s even though im not japanese?
For a lowly consumer and worker, some aspects of Japan sound great: almost no interest, cheap property, everything cost the same as 20 years ago, and still a global high quality of life. Sure the economy doesnt grow but it hasnt gotten any worse either. For macro economics and business owners, its sounds like a nightmare, for me, its great. No opportunities for great advancement but no opportunities to failing. I during Covid I was working hard like I always did but I got laid off anyway, couldnt get a job for months, huge life shifts, and a lot of suffering and depression. I rather have what Japan has now to avoid losing it all again. In this race in life only so many people can stand at the podium and the world is ever more created and utilized only for those winners. This just tells me the pursuit of a better economy and growth is not to my benefit as a citizen in a rabidly growing economy of the USA. Its another reason we should start measuring the economy with other metrics, ones that measure the health and happiness of citizens.
I would disagree with the logic that somehow Japan is way behind. They're behind in GDP but compared to the U.S they are ahead in almost every other metric. Housing, education, homelessness, crime, healthcare etc.
In Japan, some of the smaller cities, you can see young people working in relaxing jobs, slow driving and they don't earn much. These people are just living the moment, chill weather, low stress, affordable food, healthy and fresh seafood
MFW when progressive liberal policies cause the downfall of your civilization and instead of retrospective thinking you get more liberal and import conservative migrants.
I think Japan also has an issue that their technology and economy are advanced but their culture hadn’t changed. Most of the laws and the culture favor older people, which puts burden on younger people so they have less children and focus less on their work. They aren’t heard and with little to no incentive to actually innovate or try to stand out and rock the boat.
Who are these most people who want to live in gloomy norway over china
10000 yen is like $70 USD today, not $200
also japanese housing is super tiny in many places
The video is twisting facts to fit its narrative. All of Japan’s neighbors have lower birthrates and no country except Canada was able to keep their population stable by migration. Migrants to Europe are of low skilled and despite not being sufficient in number are not easy to be integrated into the value adding process. And working hours in Japan are not that crazy on a global scale. Working 80 hours a week is illegal in Japan, so that statement is not true.
定期的にこのチャンネルに話題を提供する日本すごい。 点数低いけど。
I mean most EU economies aren't really doing any better, don't get why Japan gets all the attention regarding economic stagnation. And countries like China and Korea will have it way worse in the future regarding stagnation and demographic decline going by numbers.
The US rebuilt Japan after the war. The US et all has not only *not* helped Latin America, it’s actively harmed it.
Add "i can fix her" meme here
I mean, Japan makes the BEST cars and technology
Surprising how you don't know about 'Plaza Accord'? Perhaps one of the main reason why Japan's economy has stagnated and why it didn't surpassed US.
You say Japan is a society resistant to change when over the centuries they have been one of the most adaptable Asian societies to change.
If only Japan had more immigration their economy could grow as fast as UK did in the past 20 years.
Japan is among the world's leaders in most aspects that are not GDP per capita: Life expectancy Low crime rates Housing affordability Public education system Social security system Public transportation Cleanliness
Could you do the same about the USA
Japan is 100% better than China. Or the US
10000¥ is definitely not 200$ is like 70$😂😂
Japan will recover…I have faith with the Japanese government and his people.   They will recover after tsunami… they will agin. With god and there dedication they will.  This is coming from the Philippine.  I pray for all of Japan.. and praying for the Philippines
People = Growth
Japan is very technologically advanced, not sure how you came to the conclusion its stuck in the year 2000. Many things in Japan seem futuristic to outside visitors, including their train system, vending machines for everything, automatic ordering at restaurants, sci-fi toilets, etc.
What I hate about people talking economics is that they keep repeating some version of the word "economy" in every sentence.
the timing of the upload couldn't be any better. Japan had earthquake and some sort of other things happening right now.
Thank you economic explained this  video is absolutely awesome just every other that has been uploaded to this channel ❤❤❤  World citizen ❤
old people that think that the best way is the way that they have been doing it, lets call it Boomer Stagnation
As my favorite streamer once said Japan was in the 90's in the 70's and just stayed there ever since
actualy there is a 4th way to increase productivity. The swiss route. to produce ever more expensive goods.
Check your exchange rate. 😉 10000¥ is worth ~103AUD, or about 70USD
Believe everything this channel says at your peril - it’s a clickbaity, doom-scrolling, the-world-is-going-to-end bunch of negative rubbish. Just look at their videos, and the general theme.       They don’t “explain” anything, and one wonders whether they’re actually just bad-faith trolls from overseas, if you get my meaning.             Move on and watch something else.
Maybe it’s also about having a culture of personal standards. Like having a shower, putting rubbish in a bin etc . then they don’t have to live in a sh*t hole.
PEOPLE PLEASE READ ABOUT UNIT 731.
Skilled migrant workers. Talk about cherry picking. Did you go out of your way to find that number or were you too lazy to remove the skilled part?
I wonder how much unreported work is a factor. I've known quite a few wives with their own business they keep off the books and pay no taxes.
i saw recent video interviewing citizens on current state of Japan.  They are actually doing good preventing massive inflation on goods and real estate.  However, Japan is the oldest in South East Asia or even the rest of the world in terms of falling birth rates due to overwork. Foreign workers also likely to introduce innovation that Japan is severely lacking.
Japan 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
Talking about Tokyo while showing footage of Yokohama? Come on, get stuff like that right.
No mention of the institutional racism against foreigners while speaking about skilled foreign immigration?
Great vid! No national leaderboard :(
This isn't C-class :)
@7:27 some single pixel graphics glitches are visible
Japan focused on hardware while the rest of the developed world was focusing on software. Not saying that’s the only reason and not saying Japan doesn’t have great software companies either but it is worth noting.
Everyone fears economic recession but while stuck in a ball floating in the vacuum of space with finite resources is either that or extinction.
Didn't I watch this before?
Might want to check the value of the Yen at the moment. Its nowhere near $200USD
I'm not chinese, and I do criticize China policies, but  saying people prefer Norway vs. China is a lay since little backup that affirtmation. Why? Because "nobody" like to go to Norway. Mexico, Italy and France has more einmigration not to mention US. Norway may shine in some metrics but it is not. A place where people wanna inmigrante, why? I may say terrible whether, but you could actually do a video trying to explain why even with all high well-being metrics nor.ay is not inmigrantes destiny
13:05 You need to recheck your exchange rate, buddy
Wouldn't the demand for Japan's housing skyrocket if they opened the doors to many skilled migrants as we've seen in, for example, Sydney and Melbourne over the past year (where inflation should be putting downward pressure on housing prices)?
This video was recommended to me just as I was looking for opportunities to move to Japan. I think there's definitely some lifestyle reasons to want to move there between food, walkable cities, and interesting culture, but it's good to be reminded of disadvantages like small housing and tons of work. Super informative!
Your accent is ridiculous. Like an ozzy valley girl
This wasn't a very good video. Didn't learn anything that I didn't know before.
As a Canadian I see the same problems with our terrible productivity and inefficiency with technology.
I've always looked at Japan as an example of where the West will go.  They were ahead of us, and I don't think we will fair much better then them.  We will stagnate for many decades to come.   Maybe even a couple of generations.  We are the old dogs in an AI world.  The transition from being a Primate to being a Borg wont be easy.  Future Borg wont be studying economics.  It will just do its thing.
There’s something extremely important that people miss with Japan. Because most advanced research is published in English, the vast majority of academics that only speak Japanese have a severely limited knowledge base to draw from. Furthermore, the quality of tertiary education is more limited because students don’t have such a large pool to reference in their work. While referencing every claim is critical in the West, referencing is more of a suggestion in Japan.
As a norwegiam who has lived in Japan, there are many good points here. While the slow growth of the economy might look bad on economic figures, it does not matter much to most people in Japan as they are already living quite well and most goods they consume are produced locally. I think many other countries should look to Japan as a way to live with low growth, but still high quality of life.   Things like smaller homes might look worse on paper, but Japanese homes are very well built to use to space availible, and it is so cheap to eat out that almost all social gatherings happens outside the home.  That was a big differnce coming from western Europe, where workers are paid so well that it does not make economic sense to have very cheap food, but Japan can handle that without larger issues.  The work culture in Japan is also changing as alot of the extra hours were not value generating, but part of a culture of staying at work for long, even if you finished all your tasks.
which in some countries can make a big difference to these calculations - couch - america -cough
Predictably, another video insisting Japan has to “solve” its “problem” with mass migration because it will result in “only upside”
sum ting wong
Unfortunately homogeneous countries like Japan and South Korea won't be able to turn things around
I heard Japanese companies are still using fax machines... Year 2000 indeed...
I think the real elephant in the room is that the Japanese automotive industry has been delivered a fatal blow by the Chinese one.  It's not affecting Japan only, of course, but, considered the slice of Japanese GDP produced by car making, it's not looking bright for Japan .
Leaderboard??
My take as a CPA (background in economics): everyone is hyper-obsessed with Japan's plateaued growth, without realizing that they enjoy a very high standard of living, very high per-capita GDP, and much lower inflation than other countries. And really, growth for growth's sake is not really that important once you've achieved the upper echelon of economic performance.
Japan is limited in land and resources. I hope they don't sacrifice their culture just to "TRY" and raise the economy.   Multiculturalism absolutely does not work and will cause a lot of problems. Look at the U.S., Canada, and Europe.
Japan has started experiencing inflation, which has caused a price increase in several products. Although the salary is increasing, more is needed.
Japan will always be just one giant military base for the US. The economy is fugazy.
The frustrating part is a lot of the stagnation is due to the same exact reasons the US is declining- leadership has been iron gripped by the geriatric who refuse to allow any significant change, however necessary, from happening. We get pockets of youth gaining positions whom get targeted with hate and undermined at every step here in the US though, unlike in Japan where the old has too deep a root.
Hi, I am a Town Planning Graduate working in Australia who wrote my thesis on the effects of zoning controls on development and housing prices. Given you have such a broad audience, I would heavily caution you against spreading missinformation regarding the effect of zoning controls on housing prices.   Here in South-East Queensland in Australia (comprising several urban localities including Brisbane) over the past decade we have experienced substantial uplift in zoning capacity in centres and regional areas. Contrary to this, local research shows that there was no decernable impacts from this uplift in zoning on housing prices. Recent research indicates that the uplift in zoning capacity was not realised as cost savings for housing, but simply was additional money in the pockets of landholders whom demanded increased prices for their land because their land had increased development entitlements. In more regional centres this actually resulted in stagnation and fewer developments where there was insufficient demand to make the cost of constructing high rise housing viable.   My current theory is that migration, population growth and expected future value or speculation and government polciies such as taxation have a substantially larger impact on housing prices then planning controls.   Please feel free to reply if you're interested in learning more of this and I can email you my thesis as well as a number of published articles on this topic from a professor from the Queensland Univeristy of Technology.
You must live with paying heavy social security tax for the years to come if you decide to migrate to Japan.
Funny enough the rise in tensions with their neighbours is what they need right now. Because of it they're throwing money at EVERYTHING to become a competitor in the geopolitical economy again. If their neighbours just bided their time the country would've stagnated so far that it might've a cake walk for them in their region but because they jumped the gun too quick they're now seeing a economic stimulation.  Its a country where if you push them back they comeback with a baseball bat.
Then problem with GDP growth by population growth is that it's only good if all you care about is GDP. If there question is are people better off, the answer is no, it's a wash. Unless that population growth is by more slavery, since the otherwise you are also just adding consumers to offset that increase in producers. And you've probably just increased overcrowding and burden on resources, so then actually net worse off for that gain in GDP for the sake of a gain in GDP.
Meanwhile japanese people are living the futuristic 2050 lifestyle
houses are affordable because they are shoebox
I was wondering where this was going, then Pau Krugman came up. Google him, strange ideas
I envy Japan, they aren't destroying their culture by opening their borders to immigration like most western countries. They care more about their culture than they do about increasing their GDP.
I've never quite been convinced by the argument that the economy needs to grow constantly to sustain us. I mean why? If we have enough food and products and services... where is the need? Given the population remains the same size, why more?
What's wrong with not growing anyway? It's natural to reach a certain plateau. Unless people are stupid enough to think you can grow infinitely.
Please, Japan is a highly xenophobic country. They don't attract foreign workers because they don't want them. They're more about preserving their culture, whereas America is a country of mixed cultures.
Prayers to and sending love to all those suffering from the earthquake and the plane collision🙏
We already know that Japan population declining, the only way out of the rut is through advance technology to increase their productivity, thus GDP cause they are already working at max level.  Problem is they have a higher ageing population than younger ones, and the young ones aren't having kids. Although being a 1st world country advance in tech,  attaining peak level GDP/per capita is easier with smaller population.
"growth we all enjoyed"  by we you mean billionaires.. normal people are screwed mate
“USA has the luxury of only picking the very very best” lol nope open boarders.   Let’s go Brandon
@18:14 """The growth of the Internet would slow drastically, most people have nothing to say to each other, and by 2005, it would become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy is no greater than the fax machine's. """ - Paul Krugman ("... potentially the most influential economist") 🙄  He has authored several hundred publications on economics and can't even successfully manage an ice cream stand. 🍦
The bigger problem Japan has with immigration is their culture tends to be insular which leads to policies (both official and de facto) that make it hard for immigrants to get established even if they are motivated.  For example most landlords will not rent to foreigners and those that do often charge significantly more to foreigners.
Japan went too där on the 80's and the US had to stop them somehow, so came the dip in the early 90's.
The constant myth of the "highly qualified migrant who is a boon to the receiving country". There is a reason why Australia stopped taking in the boat migrants. And it's certainly not because of all the PhDs on those boats.
You are such an economist it hurts... I mean yeah I get that's what the channel's about but... GOD. It's painful sometimes.
Japan's population has reached market saturation and productivity per capita can't really grow much more since it's already as high as technology currently allows. Until the next technological revolution, this as as big as their economy can get. Just like stocks stop 10x-ing when a market is mature, the same is true of GDP
The not having to pay for education is only partially true,  many immigrate prior to graduation so at least part of their education is provided by the host country.
Looking back to 15-25 years ago, it was in vogue for American journalists, politicians, academics, etc. to criticize and mock Japanese government policies for infrastructure construction as nonsensical, wasteful. Overlooked in these (rather superficial) analyses is many of these construction projects have been shown to improve the resiliency of different aspects of the economy, including transportation & goods distribution networks, etc. -- beside keeping Japanese workers employed. To the Japanese, if a city is devastated by natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes), then it has to be rebuilt (better to withstand future calamities). To many Americans, it was OK to let New Orleans rot, after Katrina, and its people can just move elsewhere. Today, there is increasing recognition, in fact appreciation, of the merits of such infrastructure-building policies. It has dawned on many Americans that the wonderful, world-leading Japanese High-Speed Rail technology -- even though not cheap -- has the potentials to solve many problems ailing American cities.
Please remove the background  music.
Japan isn't open to immigrants which will forever doom their economy unless they loosen up immigration. The anime create a hug line of weebs willing to live there and replace the declining population.  Many people are perfectly fine living in Japan.
Japan has the same problem of Italy, France, and many post-developed economies, in that they do not make babies anymore. That's right, they have a negative growth rate and are NOT compensating with immigration like the USA, because they are very xenophobic. China has the same problem. Other countries, like in Scandinavia, are compensating by liberal use of government sponsored child support, maternity leave, etc, to encourage people to have children. Women working in Japan with no intentions on a family, the one Child policy legacy in China, and general move of women to corporate life is causing long reaching and devastating economic effects. They need to encourage people financially to have families or allow immigration of workers. Otherwise, it's a death spiral.
I’m amazed you consider Paul Krugman as one of the most influential economists. Here in the USA he’s largely considered being a joke, taking both sides of many issues. Most telling is while he was a key pre election advisor to Bill Clinton he found no post in his administration. The observation that wages follows productivity was old before Krugman was born.
GDP sucks as a metric
Argentina hasn't succeeded because of socialism and Japan hasn't failed because of capitalism.
Not only won’t Japan be fixed, but every western country will also develop in this direction. Old society, deflation, absurd real estate prices.  Open your eyes! It happens right now.
theres a reason why warren has poured billions into japan
Why did you use an image of a Honda CR-Z to represent a Civic?
What would happen to the economics of countries, if brain drain was capitlised on?  That is, countries that people migrated from charged a "brain drain fee" to countries that citizens migrated to.
I mean, you do know that Japan's population is shrinking, especially the younger generations that spend more?  Japan's GDP is projected to shrink 25% by 2050.  This also explains Japan's innovation years, when their boomers were young and willing to take risks.  Now, they are old and won't.
😂 Bro I was just in Tokyo. Buisness take Dec 29th to Jan 5th off. And they and China have Golden Week. I never had week off for Christmas to January 1st in US.
the younger work culture in japan is shifting.  they know that being overworked isn't beneficial to the society at all.
126,176th viewer of this video!
A fixed Japan = a fixed unsinkable CV of the US  For the sake and interest of the world.  Make sure it will never happen.
Thank god their population is dropping. Not enough though. And hopefully the economy wont grow any more. That is just stupid, the planet cannot take it. You are a bit of a pro growth shill. Best you do some research into sustainability before your next video.
There will be a point where the best nations will level off into slow, very slow growth but it'll be a large and steady economy with a high living standard and high pay at a point where all out growth isn't the thing. In a developed economy growth actually isn't the thing. You want sustained development with minimal setbacks but Japan has some of the best allies on Earth and in the end Japan is in a good spot imo. Solid vid
Japan will still exist culturally in 100 years, the US and Europe will both be gone and replaced with something that values existing over making a dollar. It's not because they're done technologically or not advancing, they're just way old right now. All of these problems will fix themselves in time
The short sighted reporter and economists would say japan is on the decline but i think the rest of the world's population still respect and would choose japanese product in a heartbeat... I avoided Samsung and LG tv and chose Sony. Not the flashiest or the most tech laden but the last Japanese tv lasted 15 years.
Robots will solve everything.
Watch it at 0.75 of its original speed. Great content.
I thought Japan was doing better lately.  They don’t have rampant poverty, uninsured citizens, or homelessness.  I would be happy to live in Japan ifit wasn’t sp humid.  Tons of females available too.
Replacement migration is not a solution nor is it worth the destruction of your country for a bigger gdp number.
I gotta disagree with you on the size of apartments. While there are apartments that are smaller than one you might find in other cities, you can also find larger apartments as well. I would imagine you could get an apartment for the same size in other cities around the world. Just because there are smaller options, doesn't mean they all are. And what luxuries are these apartments missing?
i feel that anyone who can look with realistic econ & societal eyes already knows, Japan is going to crash into the nation equivalent of a Burn Out. it's so obvious it's not even funny anymore how others will call you crazy for predicting the obvious.
You were doing fine until you mentioned Paul Krugman, whos been wrong about everything for almost forever.
Migration is not an option unless the migrants have accepted the culture of the country they re going to work in, or at least, respect it. Getting super - poor workers from the -stan countries to do odd jobs like harversting crops, building, or painting walls doesnt really add much to the economy, as it would be much more productive to direct its unemployeed population towards these jobs instead. Also if migrants think their ultimate aim for migration is to multiply themselves and spread their faith they refuse to intergrate into the society and end up ghettoed.
Ask the United States of America what happened to Japan ?
Did this just forgot all the bad parts of migration? Why does he sees just the good part?
this seems like an old upload
one thing for sure is that they don't need foreigners to "help" with their economy.
Japanese economics= Manga, henti and video games. 🤷‍♂️ Pretty sure there is robotics and hologram girls friends too. I guess when they combine all these things into one. They will both thrive and destroy birthrates even further 🤔
People will always prefer the good thing over the right thing
Nice!
watch "Princes of the Yen". it explains how japan got to where it is w/o the Keynesian spin
Whatever you say about the advantages of immigration into a country with a lower birth rate, the USA is being screwed.  We are getting the dirty end of the stick with the type of immigrant we are receiving – due to the poor policies of the Biden administration.
Most massive bubble in all of world history. Entire world will experience housing and stock market crashes that will make 2008-2010 look mild, and unemployment will hit 12%+.
Huge debt both Corporate, National and Private??? Transition away from Fossil Fuels painfully slow?? What happened to new ideas and production?? Could Robots provide the extra Population and output that Japan needs??
Look how much Japan makes from their IP by locating manufacturing near demand (America and Asia in particular)
Japan was the first to reach to reach the 2000 status quo and will be the last to leave it
Another gently washed video without much tangible. In other words: That was boring. the conlcusion was so arbitrary, it was like we were not talking about Japan anymore, but a random country that works like x+y=z. Shallow like a puddle.
A low birth rate is a good things. High birth rate = poverty stricken nation in every instance.
"it's usually the best and brightest from 3rd world countries migratin.." HAHAHAHAHAHAHA pls god stop it i can only laugh so hard at the circus.
They just need to ease up on weed lol and then they will truly be the best in the world
Over my entire investment life, since 1990 to today, the Nikkei has had a net loss for 30+ years. I feel sorry for Japanese retiree, economy as the stock market is a forward looking indicator.
Something weird is happening in Japan??? Who would have guessed?
Did anyone else think the formula at 5:21 was janky? Like there shouldn't be a non before institutionalised, and employed + unemployed = everyone
Japan is not in crisis... Japan just achieved the maximum development possible for its population without depending of deep inequality like in the western countries.  Now the question is, do the western economies ready for population decline like Japan?
0:37 is that Japan or china?
Conparing Japan and Korea is weird to me i see Korea is like Japan in some ways but wanting to make new things all the time while Japan wants to be in the past yet both have similar economic problems yet Korea is more focused on weapons and such while Japan is more focused on consumer products
Japan is.... always weird
They have so many upcoming issues, including the death of their auto industry due to them dragging their feet on electrification.  I wish them the best, but I would be shocked if their economy does not take some very big hits in the next ten years.
I blame the culling games/shibuya incident.
culture plays a big part, as you said in the beginning, its different from others and unexpected like argentina.
No one has mentioned the importance of the Japanese Car industry and its potential collapse. China is makin the transition to electrify all Transport. There are over 90 electric car manufacturers, many of which will have to merge or go bust. However, BYD will be the new Toyota. Japanese have ignored electrification of the Car industry. This is a crucial point as  the Car industry, and its supporting industries employ a significant amount amount of people. When it fails, which it will, it will create a massive tsunami which will affect the entire economy of Japan. I love visiting Japan and I drive a Toyota. However, Toyota And its most recent managing director are the worst offenders, ignoring the move to electric vehicles. this will be their death knell.
Why the hittin it #literally #hard now by "real" earthquakes......😅😅😅
Is it true that summer is honored able!
Can you do a video on the Economics of Bulgaria? Since I was born Bulgarias gdp was $13.6billion with a population 8.2million and now it’s gdp is $90billion with 6.8million people How has it grown by 600% yet losing 20% of its population
The more I study economics, the more I realize that our world economies are just a complex form of slavery.
Keeping the nice things they have (and the rest of the developed world is increasingly losing) might require the policies that seem "bad".
I am under the impression that Japanese citizens are NOT ENTHUSIASTIC about immigrants coming to Japan.      Japan has plenty of  senior citizens, maybe too many senior citizens.      Am I right or wrong ? RS.
Japans problem is that they have too low inflation and home prices
That’s what happens when you support America. They will destroy your country. Keep your friends close. Keep your enemies closer. Wake up Japan
They have a huge issue with pensions, a massive inverse age pyramid. The BoJ propping a lot of failed SMBs. Still kind of bearish.
LOL the middle east and Africa aren't sending their best😂
I'm sorry but your intonations are too distracting to watch the entire video through
Obviosuly the kamis are angry and relinquishing the Japanese to quell their anger
End the LDP and let the conservatives rule again.
You mean 24 years behind bro
Society is like a person. If you say "teenager is the best" then Japan isn't.
And yet Chinese malls are dead and closed, while malls in Japan are filled with shoppers, and there are no closed stores. China is going down the toilet, and Japan is looking very robust indeed. There's actually nothing wrong with not growing. And given the population decline across the globe, massive changes will soon hit economies, as housing stocks take a plunge, and the drivers of growth have gone.
Jappan is.ground braking😂
GDP is a useless metric these days. Used to mask enormous gaps in wealth between a handfull of people and the rest of us.
"The USA has an advantage of importing millions of skilled workers"  Thats how you call the south border now?
Looking at europian countries and the issues they are having with migrants atm, i cant really blame japan for being against immigration. Having visited Japan twice now id had for its social culture and way of life to change, such as in london, sydney (not in europe obviously) and paris....
It's dumb to say Japan's companies are falling behind just because their stock value is lower. Stock valuations have so little to do with the real world they shouldn't even be considered. Look at company revenues instead.
ethnically homogenous trust based societies with strict legal systems will always out-perform and out survive the mulatto mess we've created in the west.
Globalism is now trying to attack Japan. To any Japanese reading this, heed my warning. BEWARE THE DESTROYERS.
stop playing with ai, its stupid.
I'm seeing this ground news ad everywhere. How do they possibly determine fact and left/right leaning from every story everywhere in the world?? And please don't say AI cos that would be fucked.
I think that with geopolitical competition, a group of high-tech companies may withdraw from China and Taiwan, and Japan is the best destination. Perhaps Japan has another opportunity for industrial upgrading. What the Japanese government should do most now is to work hard to attract skilled immigrants from China and Taiwan and integrate its own semiconductor industry chain.
Peter zeihan
Japan and Italy are very similar economy. Old demographic, high debt but internally financed,  low growth, export economies and so on…
19:15 / 19:29
Your take on the positive impact of immigration really sounds like a theoretical economist rather than a guy that lives in the real world lol
I was in Japan last year, and the majority of people were using outdated smartphones and technology while it looked advanced it was woefully outdated in context. I think living in the early 2000s is pretty spot on.
10k yen is less than 100 usd (about $70). Maybe you mistook the value of that note to be what it was during the housing bubble?
You are my special.
I cant stand the british, the worst country alive. Greed is at their core.
Technologically, Japan is living in year 2000.  Wow that is really true, summed it up why it is stagnant in technology innovation and other areas that depend on innovations.
The vast majority of immigrants are not skilled labor in the US this is a straight up lie.
Interestingly the situation in Japan is fairly normal for the nation. If you look at Japanese history in aggregate, a pattern emerges. Japan tends to stagnate in technology for decades or centuries until something dramatic happens and they rapidly modernize often far faster than anyone else in the world, before stagnating again. The best example of this is the stagnation under the Tokugawa shogunate and then rapid modernization into the Empire of Japan, where Japan got stuck in 1925 until 1945 at the end of WW2. Then they rapidly modernized again and now are stuck again. I suspect here in anothet couple decades something will happen and Japan will again rapidly modernize getting to the bleeding edge before stagnating again.
Sure seems like money is just numbers on a database back by absolutely nothing or something.. lol
Bit of a nitpick or question: is market cap really an appropriate proxy for the "worth" of a company? If we look at the actual value of production and sales, is TSLA really worth more than Toyota?
So Japan also uses government censorship just like US government controls the media😂. It’s not just China guys. Yet western media will only bashes China.
One thing of note: Immigration is beneficial to both the sending and receiving countries. There is research from the World Bank, the European Economic Association and numerous independent researchers supporting this
So Japan’s economy is functioning well despite decades of stagnation, and only having issues because the rest of the world insists on growth for growth’s sake, weakening the Yen. Sounds to me like the problem is the world, not Japan. I hope in my lifetime I can live in a country that isn’t obsessed with constant growth. Growth is the economists’ “turtles all the way down” - always demanded but never truly justified. If anything, continuous growth is causing the decimation of our planet.
7:18 "The options for growing a population are having more children or bringing people from abroad". Let me introduce the 3rd option: robots. I think Japan went with the 3rd option.
Bureaucracy is also a hindering factor. Everyone jokes about how ineffective their own government is thanks to bureaucracy, but they have nothing on Japan. Everything still needs physical paperwork. Japan still needs hours of paper work and faxed document to sign up for a phone plan. Banks can't accept pdf document sent via email and the client has to print it off themselves off site to hand in the same document, they can't even print it inside the bank.
Addendum regarding sane immigration rules: Japanese society had to be dragged screaming and kicking thru ANY great change (The Black Ships of Matthew Perry, then the end of WW2 as some examples) even if in the end it BENEFITED THEM GREATER THAN THE VERY SAME SOCIETAL CHANGE DID ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD (see opening up to the West, which basically broke china for a century, or losing their EMPIRE but still dodging being forced into the soviet empire)
Japan's technological stagnation has a source people regularly gloss over. Demographic decline, technological innovation is driven by young, intelligent, ambitious people.
The seniority culture of Japan, along with their long lifespan means currently all of the grand old zaibatsu are in the process of being dragged down by their dying CEOs unable to understand the modern markets BUT still having ultimate authority AND respect. The only reason they are not all bankrupt YET, is because japan was, unlike china today, ACTUALLY was gaining on the US economy in the 80s, and not just had a commie tyrant massaging numbers for their own benefit and to entrap supply chains.
I‘d love to see a deeper dive into post-growth economies on this channel!
I think Japan would commit economic and social sudoku if they invited migrants in. They're a country that didn't care about the infinite growth meme and are actually better off for it.
I would much rather live in the Pearl River Delta of China than in Norway
Japan's stagnation was primarily because of their aging population. their economy collapsed in the '90s and it's no mistake that pretty much exactly 30 years later, the economy is recovering. this is because in the '90s and such, a lot of old people retired. they then had to spend a lot of their effort taking care of these old people for around 30 years when they are finally starting to pass away. It's no mistake that the exact same year that Japan's aging is finally coming to an end their economy starts to restart. in this way, it is not unique to Japan and every country will experience something similar as long as they have the same population curves going on. Japan is also helped by finally allowing some level of immigration which is easing a lot of pressure in job areas such as low skilled labor, running convenience stores and doing basic housework at hotels which are very common in Japan. this free is a lot of the labor force of native Japanese people to be engaged in more productive work leading to economic growth.
Just in time guys. Let’s see if real life lore uploads too.
Adding to their inability to attract migrants, Japan is also just a very racist country. It may not be the type of racism where people are heckling you on the streets, but it's the type where people treat you differently and sometimes even as a spectacle if you're certain rare races. Ironically, they're even more racist towards non Japanese Asians, especially those that can't speak Japanese. Japan is notoriously monocultural, so it's a very big reason why migrants wouldn't want to go there.
Did you just spit out one more video about Japan with basically the same information, because they just had an earthquake and airplane crash. So that you can get more  views while they are on the news? Hustling too much?
I'm not convinced that you can increase GDP by working people harder. My experience is that the longer the average person works, the less productive they are per hour worked. People seem to have an upper limit to how much work they're willing to do, which varies by person. In any case, Japan's tactic of working people for 80 hours a week, in my opinion, is actually to the detriment of productivity.
19:01
Ground News advertising blitz
To be fair, gdp per capita is really stagnating in a lot of countries now
Maybe Japan wants to stop buying US debt. lol
Your assessment that mass migration mostly benefits the host country is absolutely farsical in light of the recent unrest in Ireland, France, the UK, and on and on goes the list. There are such things as social costs you quite conventiently ignore and bash Japan for not doing the same. Terrible video.
That things remain stable in Japan is pretty much a testament to their culture and ethics around work.  If things take a downturn the executives are more likely to take a pay cut than having the workers fired.  Even though there are homeless Japanese it's still easy for them to retain their dignity as it's easier for them to get access to facilities were they can get cleaned up than compared to most other countries.    The flexibility of the people from top to bottom ensures that on a societal level the people remain mostly content regardless of what happens economically to them.  A stark difference from the countries that have a lot of welfare programs that encourages people to beg and feel entitled to things.
Maybe it’s also about having a culture of personal standards. Like having a shower, putting rubbish in a bin etc . then they don’t have to live in a sh*t hole.
as a cr-z enthusiast, it hurts to see it called a civic
Those Japanese Toilets (not the squat kind) are from year 2050. We in the US still havent caught up to that level of technology or sophistication sadly.
Also - even though zoning laws are relatively relaxed, the value of land in Tokyo is still astronomical. The areas surrounding the imperial palace in Tokyo are worth the entire value of the state of California  EDIT: oh aha EE addresses the above point, but the thing is it is still worth that much
Theres millions of abandoned homes in Japan that you can get for free. Yes literally free houses in Japan
Housing in Japan is cheap because they have a falling population. Each year there are fewer people but the number of houses stays the same.... so you have an excess of housing.
Japan does not have a population left to support everything.  The corporations have moved their factories to Mexico, USA and indonesia where there is population. Now they are figuring out how to fix the population problem with purpose made robotics and getting people to want babies again.
Is this a reupload?
Japan's overwork was a 80s problem. Not today. Though the legend persists.  Statistically, the number of hours worked in Japan has fallen the past 20 years  to 1740hrs/yr/worker and is below USA at 1760hrs.  Not that I think raising hours a ton is a sane path. Germany sits at a mere 1350hrs. Investment in productivity increasing tech is the way forward.
Wel done! You sound so much betterr now with downward inflection ending sentences. So comfortable hearing you speak. Kepp up with the good work and great contents. Cheers
9:32 "because the USA has the luxury of only picking the very very best workers that apply to live and work there" If only the US immigration policy actually worked that way.
I know exactly how America will handle stagnation. It won't.
The US / Europe are getting the best and brightest of third world countries? I honestly hope this was attempted humor. Secondly, a country with affordable housing in its ultra modern and Productive capital that doesn't actively islamify itself?! Sign me up
International companies are copying Japan's model of salary and benefit. The average professional in Japan is not paid very well compared to their counterparts working in the same sector in another developed country. However, their benefits and social safety nets are exponentially better. For example: As an IT dept manager and cross team lead, I don't have to worry about the cost of living or safety issues in Japan at all. The wage is 2/3 or 1/2 compared to a similar position in Europe but in exchange, I had: cheap, good food, state of the art public transport system outside my doorstep, free education and healthcare for the whole family, affordable housing in some of the most desirable locations on Earth. If I were to become a naturalized Japanese citizen, there would have been more added benefits. The company takes care of its employees and the employees are happy to improve their productivity. This is not often covered in depth and presented to the West by Youtubers because not many of them are actually professionals in any field or manage to climb the corporate ladder in Japan.
If economists had their way, Japan would be forcing the elderly into the workforce rather than funding their retirement.
This is where macroeconomist failed. You assumed that a 100,000$ salary cities actually have 100,000$ salary worth of amenity and infrastructure. Visit Tokyo once and you’ll realized it is a 1,000,000$ salary worth of city design and amenity and people with 40,000$ worth of real salary.  I’ll take that over getting 100,000$ a year but living in a shithole suburb hellscape that’ll bored me to death.
The fact this video doesn't have the words "plaza accords" anywhere in it is telling. The link below tells the tale of Japan far better and far more in depth than this video, which again, without mentioning the Plaza Accords and US economic imperialism and domination makes it little more than a propaganda video.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5Ac7ap_MAY
you "forgot" to mention how racist ("xenophobic") japanese people are as one of the reasons for functionally non existent immigration.
Men in power are destroying the world
Japan serves as an illustration of a bubble created by its government. Naturally, after a downturn, it should initiate a growth phase again  But who knows how their QA influenced all of this
No more immigration to the west, PLEASE. I am tired of being replaced in my country, I don't care if it makes the line go up!
Getting women into the workforce might be great for sexual equality, but economically, it solves nothing.  The jobs women did at home still must be done, so most of the time you end up paying another woman to clean/look after the kids/whatever else, while you're off at work.  This only ends up benefiting the Treasury, as the value of the job is now taxed as income instead of left in families' back pockets.  How does this go to increasing any family's quality of life?  It just means more people are paying more tax, and have less of what was left over because they've got to pay more people to do jobs which would have been done by a spouse in simpler times.
I doubt the cultural issue of how poorly Japan treats foreigners helps them attract talent
Another video, another waste of time - I miss the time you actually said something in your videos and didnt just use filler words until you hit enough time for the algorithm
japan's economy stagnated in the 90's....anime became big in the 90's...coincidence?
Japan has recently been overtaken by Germany as the third biggest economy in the world.
@1:40 to 1:47, you didn't answer the three questions 😢
I think the amount of housing a person gets does also affect the purchasing power of people. For example, treadmill industries will flourish and contribute to the GDP only when theres ample amount of space available for people to buy it. In a place like Tokyo,  the buffer money will either be spent of other things like savings but other scenario is that income levels wont rise as fast as countries with ample housing space for people.
Pursuing economic growth at the expense of traditional family roles is unsustainable.
The most important metric is the ranking of happiness, ironically the most subjective, but would choose to live in any of top10 instead of the highest growth, GDP or whatever other metric leading country.
To get more people you can also raise life expectancy but that's hard to do and older people most likely don't work so that wouldn't increase the amount of workers anyways
Funny because Sony with phone, but actually with everything at least in Hungary is like not even trying. I can't see ads or anything about them, they just slowly disappeared...
what's with the regular spikes in this chart? 14:37
They won't change themselves.. and Japan will die, no birth, high death, no immigrants, no change in their work..
Ossified social rules that place the burden on the young  Blatant racism Overwork  Sexism  That's what is holding them back
I wish their economy can be fixed. Not because I'm emphatic to people living in a different country, but because I can see my country's economy heading towards the exact same shoes Japan is in in less than a decade. It's like solving the Trolley Problem while riding on that trolley, and it feels weird.
GDP is Grossly Distorted Propaganda  Economists have ignored the depreciation of durable consumer goods for decades.  I used to work for Panasonic. I repaired hi-fi. They made the SP-10 and the Toot-a-Loop. The latter was garbage.  Everyone should know accounting and concentrate on Net Worth and avoid planned obsolescence. But economists do not advocate mandatory accounting. They should read Adam Smith.
“All exponential growth initially appears as a linear curve.” — Elon Musk  “All S-curve growth initially appears as an exponential curve.” — Me
The west is on an almost mirrored track with late Rome. Incompetent and protected leaders A non breeding, feminine population Drawing the best from poorer, unsafe regions of the world.
The US banned Japan currency from de-valuating in the beginning of 1990s and Japan confirmed, because Japan is not a sovereign state but is controlled by the US. So, the US won the personal computing race and Japan stagnated.
I hate economists, they don’t understand that gdp growth isn’t everything, they would rather have a 50 year period of growth at the expense of birth rates dooming future generations.
Interesting but you didn’t mention that that Japan has one of the most xenophobic and exclusionary cultures in the world
Inheritance tax rates are off by order of magnitude, 600m JPY is 4.5m USD
I would never underestimate the Japanese
All I know is that when you say  media outlets I hear meteor outlets
Maybe the damage caused by immigration is worse than the benefits.
I'm curious. US has a fertility rate of 1.7 while EU has 1.5. US healthcare is the most expensive in the world. Per capita it is twice that of France. So why aren't you making a video on the US demographic problems? US also has a declining life expectancy rate, which is unique in the developed world. They are going to have real problems as 2030 approaches. I know you are going to say "immigration" but again, per capita US actually has a fairly low immigration rate, about the same as Norway.
More people doesn't mean more workers if companies are allowed to continue eliminating jobs with automation & robots & ai....
The Japanese are smart. They don’t want their population getting replaced.
You can't have an advanced economy if most of your population jerks off to cartoon (anime) girls, instead of having children.
This video ignores the two most important productive added technologies, AI and Robotics.  Japan already has a lot of robots and I would assume they are building and designing more productive ones.
Argentina and Japan... 🤣 Good stuff. For the record I think ANYONE would rather be Japan than Argentina. 😉 And anyone can predict the future. It's just generally inaccurate. 🤪
There is more to life than “make green line go up.”  Japan and its culture seem to have a better balance of growth and how to actually live life than the west’s endless consumption
Many high net worth individuals (Weebs) are moving to Japan because they've fallen in love with the beauty of the country.  They want to meet and get an anime waifu in their laifu and they want that Japanese culture that exist but isn't exactly what they've come to expect.
I'm not sure why you spent so long skirting around the issue of immigration, they dont want it becauae rhey eanr o keep their culture simple as that
Overall GDP is not important from the perspective of the vast majority of individual people. GDP per capita, wealth per capita is much more important.
I don't think the world would allow Japan to fail.
growth for growths sake isn’t necessarily a good thing. Producing anything has to take from something. No one is gonna be laughing at Japan when in 50 years they still have an abundance of nature, a low population & clean air
So....what was the good news for Japan??
Lots of weird things are happening in Japan... according to anime.
i watched this logically answered video about growth they already hit the ceiling
I am sorry but the entire analysis is flawed.  If you force your worker to work for 2000 hours instead of 1000 hours, the most likely scenario is your output of 30 Dollars goes down to 10 instead!  Which means over time, you will become worse off.  Time changes everything and Time is THE most important factor to take into consideration.  Models that do not take time as a factor are just wrong and useless.  Also, it is very rich to say what they are doing is morally right.  Theft is never moral and Japanese live like a slave.  That is why People like me go to Europe not Japan.  People vote by their feet and that vote shows japan sucks and it is not a good place to live.  Now because of their policies, everybody is worse off in Japan.  That is Keynesian economics for you.  Japan were stupid enough to follow a stupid man and today's results is the consequence of stupid choices they made.
Excellent explanation of real estate, but you neglected a couple of important points: first, buildings (houses, apartments, etc.) depreciate instead of appreciate. That is, unlike the US or Australia, buildings depreciate in the same way cars do. While the land itself will retain or increase in value, the building doesn't. This drives down housing prices and makes renting far more attractive. I'm finishing the construction of my own home, and I can tell you firsthand it's not an investment vehicle. It is, however, an amazingly affordable home in great city within walking distance to a major train station, small mountains, and a beach (albeit a concrete-lined one (this is Japan, after all)). My home is tiny (120m2) compared to those in the US, but so is my mortgage: 0.59% percent.   The second point about housing is one that you hinted at: public transportation. Convenient, reliable, clean, and affordable public transportation keeps housing prices low because workers have many more acceptable options. The effect of this is increased by the policy that companies pay for their workers commutation.   About technology: Japan did NOT adopt computers before other countries and still lags behind in general CS literacy. Japanese COMPANIES led in some areas of technology and produced consumer products (video game consoles, VCRs, phones), but that is not the same as "adopting computers" in the same way that the west did. This, combined with crippling foreign language deficiencies, are a primary cause of the current stagnation.    One minute browsing any of native Japanese websites like Rakuten or Merucari will make it painfully obvious that there is no local web design talent. Japan has only one social media company, Line, and the user base is miniscule. I teach in a business school and NOBODY is interested (or capable of) building apps. They all want to work for some conglomerate and let "the computer nerds" do the "computer stuff" because the alternative (starting your own company) means they'll never get the chance to get permanent employment and the benefits that come alone with the long, long hours required.
Wow, the disrespect shown to Nintendo. 😂
Your content is excellent, however the pace at which you read is almost impossible to follow. I ended up turning off the sound and simply reading the closed captions. Perhaps you could slow down a little bit.
Out of touch with contemporary Japanese immigration law and work expected per hour. Disliked.
LOL - dude is talking about Japan "weird" econony hahah LOOK AT MURICA OR UK !  Look at them ! Look how they are falling !
Isn't this a repost?
Last part was about technology, and ended about inflation, what wrong is with this video? Quality of this channel is going down so fast, because this is not first video which I watch and think "it was waste of my time" and that is not talking about what title is saying it would.
"I can fix her"
Black Rock taking over, thats what
You may be correct but the pain is going to be difficult as they have their population. If they would at least do replacement level births I think they would be fine
19:03 - That's got to be some of the whackiest stock footage I've ever seen. Piece of paper in hand on one side, almost illegible transparent board thing on the other, and to top it off bright neon lights in the background.
What are they doing about Hikikomori who might be a burden on society their entire lives?
What isn't mentioned is their healthcare and social programs are top tier and you pay virtually nothing out of pocket. So that offsets a lot of issues with tax, inheritance, etc.
Western economies: Ok, should we give more opportunities to our people to reproduce? Nah, let them die out, we will import another people that will work here. What?! What do you mean that less than half of them actually works? Nonsense, this system is flawless.  Result: Tons people that completely rely on welfare, original population going extinct (for example real Swedes are going to be a minority in their own country before 2050), the economy going to s/*t, everyone´s unhappy.
living in the early 2000 doesnt sound so bad compared to now.
There was a video made by TAKASHiii from Japan asking people why they think Japan is so cheap. He asked a construction worker "When and why do you think things will turn around" and the construction worker's response was that he didn't think it was declining in the first place. He said that the economy was improving, but not fast. It's very very slow in comparison to other places like China which makes people think that Japan is now poor. I'd rather be in a slow burn increase than a turbulent economy personally
I feel like there is too much emphasis on GDP. Is it because that's the only real data point one has, so one must work with that?
Maybe a bit tone-deaf on the title given the recent natural disasters..?
The economy is shaking…     How soon is too soon?
Has the Japanese economy really been stagnant since the 90’s though? Or is this a gdp/currency trick to artificially keep their gdp per capita low in an attempt to boost exports by devaluing. Going by gdp ppp growth, it’s fairly slow, but gdp ppp has somewhat grown since the 90s, much more than what it’s nominal growth suggests. Germany seems to be fairly similar, having a much higher gdp ppp than expected from their nominal gdp, possibly due to their reliance as an export powerhouse.  Going by gdp ppp per capita, it seems like most OECD nations are fairly comparable to here in the US than what their nominal figures make it out to be.
Another reason for cheap housing: No mass migration from outside, plenty of living space for young native people.
Despite the challenges faced by every sector of the Japanese economy and the need for improvement in our work culture (which has improved significantly in the past decade), I believe that we enjoy a stable and prosperous democratic society and I am proud to be Japanese. Thanks for the coverage of Japan!
Japan can handle any seismic shifts in the economy and any aftershocks that come as a result.
Saying GDP has to grow is the fundamental flaw in human thinking. Same bs as population decline is bad.
Georgia when?
For like the last decade I've been trying to tell people Japan was just ahead of the curve in a lot of aspects from economic to cultural. People made fun of Japan for having such a low birth rate but now it has the highest in E. Asia and something like 50% of American Zoomers have never even held hands.
once again u said allot and really nothing... following a path that leads to somwhere, and turn back arround in a whole other direction. a true bs economist.
I live in Japan and I tell you we are not doing that bad
What is the song playing in the background??
I don't understand the saying you use in almost every video "nobody can predict the future least of all economists". For example, wouldn't archeologists be able to predict the future less well than economists?
Isn't something weird always happening in Japan?
In addition to low birthrate and reluctance to accepting immigrant workers, I think Japan is also pretty behind on having women in the workforce because their culture makes it so hard for them. Women are still expected to do all the housework and parenting even when they have a full-time job, and the idea of young women leaving the workforce when they get married (even before they have children) is still a norm. So with all these issues combined, I think the real problem is that Japan is culturally behind and can't adapt to what their country actually needs.
Paul Krugman? Seriously? The guy that in the early 2010s openly praised Argentina and Venezuela economic policies? The guy that openly supported "let's print money, nothing bad will happen, look how great it is in south america"?   THAT GUY?
Dinnt
Not the best video timing my dude
Wow, trashing Japan transparency to shill Ground News. Gross. It's not China.
It's going down
Japan indeed had a rough start in 2024. I wish all the best upon those who have been affected by the earthquake and aircraft accident.
I really hope Japan recovers. Video games and Anime have brought me countless hours of happiness throughout my life and a majority of it came from Japan.
Productivity and wages are not the same. If Japan 4x labour participation wages will fall but the output should, all else remaining the same, 4x.
Japan is not like any other country.l They just decided they'll be good. that's it.
I think any country would have problems if they were dealing with Godzilla, Earthquakes and Tsunami's
Japan's economy is doing much better than the UK's, despite the latter adding over a million people this year. We were told this was impossible. But Japan shows the dishonesty of pro-immigration activists.
But Japan would look like a child play infront of what China is going to face
The fox spirit that was trapped inside the rock, Tamamo-no-Mae, is really coming back full force
im pretty sure i remember seeing that japan was loosening up there immigration polices to help offset there low birth rate
It's tough to believe that Japan will have big future growth given their debt situation and demographics.
While Japan like every other country has a lot of things wrong with it, I would like to see the country break free from its stagnation and experience some growth. Japan has a beautiful and unique culture and I think it's a decent enough country overall.
Japan's life expectancy is 84.62 years, don't fix what ain't broken
How can an economy stagnate for 30 years during the development of computers, mobile communication, the internet, online shopping, and literally dozens of other paradigm shifts that increased efficiency and new products and markets? I thought Japan was advanced and good at innovating and technology? It's impressive to have stagnated through all that o.o
Like we don’t know anything about anything
So many Japanese Businesses and organizations still rely on the FAX Machine, for so much on a daily basis.   a FAX MACHINE !
>Something Weird Is Happening In Japan Ahahahahaha top tier clickbait
#EconomicsExplained - In this video, you mention "Labor Productivity" and "GDP" and explain how countries can increase their numbers... but why do this at all? - Governments exist to PROTECT, SERVE AND SUPPORT their populations, NOT to increase their output or "become wealthy". - The entire World is upside down! - Stop abusing people and start respecting and supporting them. - #EconomicsExplained Fight the Greed. Explain and propagate the understanding that Governments need to serve people, not the other way around.
Because fairing is not honorbru!
In Japan people are sad AF. In Argentina people are joyous. Money is not all. It can mean very little, and we should arrive for a world in which it's hardly meaningful.
I think we also have to understand the shortcomings of GDP. It can be made to look larger just by just starting a lot of construction projects, or even taking on debt. It really is not saying a lot about how efficient the economy is operating.
Praying for Japan in 2024
Not just the best and brightest "migrants." But also the most adventurous and daring... and criminal. But also adventurous and daring. The go-getters. Those who would take a chance at doing something better. Instead of that better thing helping their community and home nation, it is instead to defile the laws of other nations in order to eek out a meager living under companies that abuse the known illegal status to get essentially slav labor. At least, when they aren't being pampered by tax payer-funded social programs. (OK, indirectly funded. We all know money printers go brr. But that's still just a tax on you and your earnings, and especially savings, via inflation.)
because they don't woke
I think I already watched this?
In your video you quote the South China morning post(SCMP) which is used by the Chinese government to promote their soft propaganda. It is owned by alibaba group.
Ya don’t say?
Ironic title, a little tone deaf.
8:00... RLY ... on single thing, that kills culture and economy is shown as good ...
Japan still has essentially modern-day slave labor, which people put up with because of the benefits of living in Japan, so they still got the fuel that powered every single first- and second-world economy in history. Give it a couple of decades of suppressing their suicide rates and they will begin to fail (and not know why).
No country escapes demographics...
Japan's economy is playing a real-life game of Mario Kart. One minute you're leading with a golden mushroom, the next, a blue shell called 'recession' hits you out of nowhere #EconomyKart
Love your content!
My take as a CPA (background in economics): everyone is hyper-obsessed with Japan's plateaued growth, without realizing that they enjoy a very high standard of living, very high per-capita GDP, and much lower inflation than other countries. And really, growth for growth's sake is not really that important once you've achieved the upper echelon of economic performance.
Also Japan became the 4th largest economy, having fallen behind Germany which is now the 3rd strongest.
first POGGERS
Japan is too conformist and stifling. If it doesn't open up (both to immigration and changes in the way of doing business) it'll continue to wither. (Cue the ethno-state losers screeching about immigrants and such).
Japan will be the first to recover from its demographic crisis of any country going through this change. By the time that happens maybe elder scrolls six will be out.
If japan proves that you don't need mass immigration to prop up an ageing population the west has destroyed itself for no reason
Odd timing considering the earthquake lol, "Something Weird Is Happening In Japan", yeah the earthquake? lol
Watching from Japan
Japan definitely is having a rough start to this new year....
