🎉
thank you for this video @ColliderBehindTheScenes
Я не розмовляю англійською я українець😂
I almost is Millie Bobby Brown
Yoo will be
2:54 bro is filming with a iPhone 😂
We don't need to hear you talking
We're the actors of argyle and Jonathan actually high
She did not it’s a wig
Why does Jonathan look like Harry styles 😭
Give it a fucking break
Yo did somebody say ABQ at 4:09 Yo
I think Millie did want to shave her head again but they wouldn't let her. I heard her say that in a different video
Performances that really gave me goosebumps is > • Sadie sink in dear Billy and ❤️‍🔥🤌🏻 and Max's song  • It's not okay for some people but Nancy wheeler I liked her so much at the end of volume 1 she looked like feiry musketeer 🥷🏻💂🏻‍♀️ As she fights 💣 against vecna  • Last one is everyone's favorite Eddie Munson 🥲❤️‍🩹 Loved him throughout the series!!! Deserved better 🤧💕
the reason millie didn’t shave her head again was because by this time she had many other roles that she needed her hair for and this meant she couldn’t shave her head.
It is amazing 👏  That is very good  video!!!!!!!
HOW does some people that castrator thing sounds different there regular voice!
I can’t wait to see the new Stranger Things cause it’s my favourite movie and my favourite character is Dustin❤😊
7:18 they didn't have to kill them
At billy cameo: You saw sus things so you checked the comments to dodge that sus momment

Honestly, Im kinda sad that “Running up the hill” is now considered a stranger things song. It was a amazing song till every 7-15 year old just didn’t know it was a song before stranger things. Cmon guys, I know you are all better then this…

Chrissy wake up
Are you saved? Where will you go when you die? Heaven or hell?   The Gospel, which means the Good News is the news that God Almighty, the Creator came in the flesh as Jesus Christ to take away the sin of the world. The one God is a trinity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Son came and laid down his own life to save ours.  His sacrifice on the cross paid the price for our redemption with his own blood. On the third day he rose from dead and offers the gift of salvation and forgiveness to those that repent and trust in him. Although God's creation was created perfect, having no death, sickness and disease, the creation became corrupted through Adam and Eve in them disobeying God. In this rebellion the creation became fallen through the curse of sin and mankind became separated from God. This world is fallen, but God offers reconciliation to him through his provision at the cross. Ultimately God will restore his creation to perfection when he returns but those that reject his offer of redemption will remain condemned by their sins and go to hell.   John 1:1,14 KJV In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and THE WORD WAS GOD. [14] And THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH, and dwelt among us,  1 John 3:8 KJV He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.  Isaiah 9:6 KJV For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty GOD, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.  John 1:10 kJV He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and THE WORLD KNEW HIM NOT.
7hrs damn
How how y'all got her flying I don't think I have a roll because I didn't saw one
Hello
Noah and Billie smacking into eachother restored my childhood happiness.

I thought he was covered in lewd?
What I gotta ask is, how did they break there bones behind the scenes
Is it for me or have I not noticed that most of the characters are British-
0:41 “Jamie Cambell Power”💀
Can’t sleep I’m not getting bored 😐 I can’t do nothing I can’t sleep

No offense to Vecna but hes not very scary in my opinion-
This has made me wanna become an actress when I become an adult
Max: are you real?.. el: yeah I pigged back from a pizza dough freezer☺️
it must be so fun to be millie bobby brown and being populair and having fun on set and thats just all i have ever dreamed off
How about the past Millie in season 4?
How do they pull off breaking bones and moving their arms and jaw in impossible ways and gouching your eyes out and bleeding from your eyes-💀
Can we plz talk about max amazing performance she should get a award or something
Why does Millie’s wig remind me of kiwi skin 😂
I like your name is like Stranger Things name 😊also KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK 😊

SPOILER YOUR A SPOILER
M
I wish i was on stranger things 😪
Also me living in New Mexico
Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be returning so please Spread the Gospel !! God bless yall !!
The whole season was sad asf
😘🐈🐈‍⬛🦈🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🦭
I didn’t know that tt said bad language but ok
I really wish you would just play the BTS instead of reciting them..
Can Millie n Noah get married already ❤️
the stranger things actors’ networth: *very high* the stranger things actors: *excited to get ice pops*
Hey Guys! I'm Eddie I'm Back! And I Did Not Die to death so how are you guys??
Milly Bobby brown is awesome
Say if I ONKY could~ I'd make a deal with god~ I'll get him to swap our places~~we're running off that road~~ we're running up that hill~we're running off that building....
Vecna looks like a messed up Dr.sues character
My rock band teacher is in Stranger Things
I love stranger things
0:43 jamie be a whole lego set for ages 16+
i live in lithuainia
Walter Hartwell white I live in Albuquerque new mexico
Such superb acting powerful direction and best way of story telling.
ouch vecnas part would hurt alot💀
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Them filming in new mexico is so awsome. I saw what caused a netflix building to burn down. It was a flameing bush close to the studio. Yaay im so happy they filmed in new mexico. Going back with my friends to roller king soon.
Nice move I'm watching 11 is nice
Millie is just full of energy and never gets tired, every behind-the-scene shot was her jumping around laughing and playing tricks. How the heck could she do that??
Did you know running up that hill is about Kate bush’s lover Committing suicide and when she says Swap are place’s she means she wanted it to be her to die
I keep seeing "let's take a moment to appreciate 'so and so'". They all did absolutely fantastic. No ones acting or dedication to the show is diminished or should be. They are all appreciated and immensely talented. Can't we appreciate everyone without feeling the need to single out specific individuals? We all saw the same show.
Did I miss something? The thumbnail shows the scene with Max in the cemetery being lifted up with a harness and/or straps around her, yet I didn't see it?
i live in new mexico!!
It’s so cool and fun to skate at the rink in the show cuz I live in that area
vecna sound like he been smokin for 30 years
Hello
Eddie's performance was amazing
Noah and Jonathan's speech, Sadie's acting, and everything Eddie brought to this season was great.
I never knew it was a wig tbh I thought she actually shaved her hair
I’m mad they put max in a coma
Refused to shave her head….wish I have the power to say no when my boss ask me to do something … 😔
If steve dies I swear I am going to find out who made Netflix
😤😭
Hah
59:21
Blip blip blip blip blip bli blip blip blip blip
All the dislikes are likes from the upside down
Guys max died
in the fight scene i didnt knew they was filming with an iphone lol
eeeeeeeee
Caleb mclauflin 🤡
omg the roller rink was in albuquerque new mexico that’s a breaking bad reference
everyone loves new mexico until you witness somone get shot...
You legit just spoilt season four for me in 56 seconds are you happy now!!!! But it’s mostly my fault bc I have t watched it yet I’m watching it tomorrow
It is sad though when the detective with the mustache dies of bleeding out.
It's only me who see that Jonathan look like Michael Jackson??
Roller Run Location got me like: JESSE GET IN THE RV WE ARE GOING TO GET FOR A BURGER
I live in new mexico
THere is no scene like they doing max fly😐😐😭😭😱😱😡😡😡😡
Max has my same DARK MAROON LIKE RED VANS FROM 3RD GRADE!!!!!!!!!!!!
But why does Charlie look so much like harry styles
they were most definitely high eating those quesadillas 😅
7:50 (SOMEWHAT relevant story) When I was in my mid 20's, I made a company logo for a Lithuanian movie producer. And he claimed that he would not be paying the 2nd half of the payment because he didn't like the logo. But then I found out he used it on his company website, watermark header, and many other things. I was very mad, but decided to do nothing about it because I just didn't want to have anything to do with a person like that.
Hi from Ukraine 🇺🇦
I felt in love with Sadie... My raisin muffin Sadie😻😻
God loves u have a great day!!!
4:45 so millie can suck things faster I LIKE THAT!!
Stop with the annoying fn ads
Man the agent was such a badass when he waa defending the kids. Got all these soldiers coming in with assault rifles and here he is with a single pistol going all John Wick/ Jason Bourne style
I absoloutly loveeeee stranger things but the bloopers Y E S
Season 4 Stranger Things is possibly the best thing Netflix have ever produced!
Just wanted to put this somewhere. I think will is going to be a traitor.
since stranger things is around the 1980s it would probably be that season 5 of stranger things might be the back rooms because the backrooms is in the 1980s
I would love to be in the show/seems like movie lol.
amazing ty for this cant wait like CANNOT WAIIIITTTT for vol 2 : DD !!!!
I literally went to that roller skating rink like 2 days ago
mask wearing cringe
Roller rink in alberquerque new mexico!!!!  Jesse, We need to skate
thanks for the spoiler warning - NOT ...
Woow
I had been avoiding watching stranger things bc i assumed it was just another over hyped Netflix show that wasn’t that good. I stand corrected lol. The actors in this show are extremely talented and you can see how much time and effort everyone puts into this show and their role. Whether they last for a season or they’ve been here since season 1. They all pull their weight. Especially shoutout to Jamie because I can’t imagine how time consuming and hot it was playing vecna.
Gods good
Wow, I really thought Vecna was just CGI.
After i finished all the seasons, What is the point of the life now?
“ok but can we talk about” shut the fuck up bro that’s the point of the video
Watch Stranger Things Only on Netflix  -> https://www.netflix.com/strangerthings
All noah did in this season is being gay
That face off in season 4 vol 1: no 1 vs El is obsoultely legit 💥  Waiting for the final showdown.. 💯🔥🔥
I'll be honest, when I click on a video about behind the scenes? I expect a lot more videos of behind the scenes. I don't care for the show clips I've already seen. If you guys had photos, I want to see the photos for more than a split second. Are there any photos/videos of the red house set instead of just talking about it?  This is more fun facts than behind the scenes
Season 4 of Stranger Things just hit the ball way out of the park. I just couldn’t stop binge-watching it. The soundtrack was fantastic as always and I rediscovered my childhood fandom of the wonderful Kate Bush. “Max” was my star of the season. I was crying my eyes out as she was elevating during that scene. Can’t wait until 1st July for the next volume.
Sometimes I think it would be easier to make this actually real
Best video on ST4! Most accurate and informative, thanks! Also well edited. Cool! 👌💯
Milly booby didn't shave her  head because she is doinng enola homes 2 and she doesn't want to
jamie i will pray for u isn't it hot lol
You cant tell me Charlie Heaton looks like Harry Styles.
Oh... For me it was incredible to hear a lot of my native language - Russian 👏👏👏 they tried their best and although sometimes it was hard to understand 😂 I've never seen such before 😍 great work
What moment was y’all’s fav?
It is so good and fine
how did Millie have fun here in New Mexico is my question 😭
Season 4 has had me on the edge and screaming.
I lived in Albuquerque 🥲🤌💀
STOP IT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I LIVE IN ABQ ACROSS THE STREET IT A LITTLE WALK FROM RINK O MANIA BROO
ST season 3 is best
I think it is obvious that Vecna is just the actor in a rubber suit. Looks mediocre in my opinion.
Funny how Millie keeps the American accent when she's not acting.
hello hello balh balh I am interested in the bed and the little things are going to take a look at the apartment and I will be sure to let you know if I have any questions or concerns about the position I am in the process of applying for the job the job the job is for you guys and will let you know if I have any questions or concerns
I JUST SPOILED WHO VECNA WAS😭😭😭😭
Can I just say, I’m 11 and my dad is Barrie Gower and what the hell???? 2425 pieces stuck on?!?!? ( about 25 pieces stuck on ) And no he was not painted with jelly this man is not telling the truth.  :/
*kate bush songs Babuska and Running up that hill
DID HE SAY WERE RUNNING 🏃‍♀️ UP ⬆️ THAT ☝️ HILL!? 🌞
Nice tv series!
This season was insane. INSANE. And that plot twist in the end where Victor's son was 001 who was in turn vecna was bloody amazing. Jamie's a great actor.
pin me or ill pin you
are they filiming on an iphone??
Blip.. blip blip.. blip bliiippp, bli blip blip blip
I wish Argyle was in earlier seasons, dude steals every scene.
i like it when dey lift her up casue i wanna fly like superman
just did a literal 36 hour binge catching up on ST...fun, chock full of goodies. BUT, i gotta tell ya....is there ANY REASON WHY the writers have (had) these teen actors SWEAR SO MUCH ESPECIALLY TAKING THE LORDS NAME IN VAIN? For that reason alone i wont pick up any further episodes nor will i remain on Netflix. I think this really topped me over. Im done. I can enjoy secular gnarly entertainment to a degree...but have kids take Gods name in vain when they are duking it out in 'spiritual' battles--- makes no sense. Can you change it up? Please.....
I can’t believe Dacre and Sadie weren’t even together? Wow, the talent! That scene made me cry🥺💕
ok so well how do they float in the air?
Bgm
u should put a spoiler alert there u know someone hasnt watched it yet
2:30 NO WAY HES FILMING WITH A PHONE
ALBUQUERQUE NEW MEXICO? WHERE IS WALTER WHITE IN ALL OF THIS
Oh my god spoilers😠😠😠😠
jamie and sadie… those two are amazing. bright futures they have
U spoiled it now
sssssssssssssssssssssss
I live in new mexico

.@  .
@.  .
IN NEW MEXICO?! THATS SO COOL!
my mom is a mom <3
this is epic
👍👍👍👍
I love this show but I hate cgi. Pretty soon you won’t even need actual real actors or real locations. What’s the point in that?
omg i didn't know they exist i thought they were dead i finished it foreign thing
I ❤ that Freddy cruger was in that episode. At times it reminded me nightmare on elm st
“It was kinda a rough day but the ice pops made it like hoh 😯”
а можно на русском
I don't understand why they need golfing lessons. Those 2 are stoners and probably never golfed in their life. Why would they need proper form?
Why these villains don’t have nose?😂😂
This looked so sad and bad now it doesn’t
0:03 doesn’t Millie sound like Olivia Rodrigo
The glitch sound was #&(“873(+8(&4($76&&”(67”&=$ and had been hidden! In sounds. This has a help me velocity which is small. But we use ai to audio! Make it loud!
2:56 - 7:52 filming with a cell phone? wtf?
So sorry but this new season is boaring
Season 4 connects all the seasons so well. The end of S4 just amazes me, where they die they make a gate. Throughout the story all knew el opened the 1st gate but no one knew how. And how that connected in the end and how the gate was opened in the first place and 1 being vecna........damn how do they get such amzing ideas. A huge applause to the entire team ❤️❤️❤️❤️
good
could have put spoilers in the beginning welp...
06:20 i found a exact doppelgänger on youtube;)
Might be so fun be an actor😩
Algum BR??
Albuquerque you say???
And no one talks about the Alaska scenes..
I believe that actor pho plays 001 is the musician, I could swear I saw him in different movie as well and he is a great actor.
i be honesst i think they tried too hard in this season they could of done better. 1-3 are my favorites not the 4th
3:30 Lmao, pro golf form? 🤣
this reminds me of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CZT_XejBzg
You son of a bitch literally put out the biggest spoiler in the first 49 sec
I hope and pray they all grow up to be stable and successful good persons.
Omg i was so mad I Thought papa actually shaved it
Vecna’s the daughter of Voldemort, he got his nose oops, nvm he got no nose 💀💀
Maybe don't post spoilers in thumbnail pictures? Not all of us have a chance to just binge an entire season within the first few days. I saw this thumbnail days before I saw the actual episode.
Why did the agent have that shirt edited on him....?
SPOILER ALERT
A Major spoiler warning was needed.
The acoustic debt algorithmically object because mine encouragingly depend around a judicious verdict. spurious, soft partridge
So season 4 was when they got close
lol and the hardest thing is the editing probably 😂
I love the new creatureeeeee, but nothing beats the demigorgon
Bring BILLY back and don’t kill off EDDIE
me living in new mexico 😏
"although i am a bit bigger now" lol
The only question that is on my mind, how did Vecna ​​went to the toilet?
Harry Steels in that you
Great series. Great actors. Cool
I'm surprised that anyone got screen time at all considering how big of an ego Millie has.
okay I got spoiled bye
am i tripping or was that one scene filmed with an iphone??
Everyone is so so talented, especially Sadie Sink. Her acting is INCREDIBLE. Max is definitely at the top of my favourite characters. Sadie is such a talented beautiful person
Wait, did you just give away a major spoiler within the first 20 seconds! Some of us haven't finished watching it! Dude, give a warning next time
blip
3:38 I THOUGHT IT WAS HARRY STYLES LMAO
SPOILER ALERT🙂
I WENT TO THAT SAME ROLLER SKATING PLACE AND I FALL AT THE SAME PLACE THEY DID LMAO
confused so much but
woah
Jeepers creepers
how am i gonna live in new mexico and not know they were her .... like i couldve seen the crew but no im a loser and didnt know :'(
ima watch this tomorrow
Wish that’s as me lol
Why no one  is  talking about our dear hopper..🥺 He was also tooo good in this season..  Especially in the escaping scenes 🔥
I live in New Mexico! I remember seeing them filming and being “Oh, I wonder what they are filming”
they all did amazingly. I hope they do a 5th season. I wish I could be in it because I am a great actor and it would be an oner to be related to el in the 5th season if they have one.😇
Jamie is so good looking omg
Jamie Campbell "Power"
4:00 did u say Albuquerque New Mexico ?? Mr white
Spread the gospel you never know when Jesus is coming back 🙏 And have an amazing day God bless you all 🙏
There was no spoiler warning
Did u know that season four is gonna have to more episodes in July 1st
My favorite was when hopper poopied all over the mind flayer.
"and you get some seriously badass scenes"
el actually kinda looks like joyce
For me, I think Season 4 best performance goes to Sadie, David Harbour, and Jamie.
Soy solo yo o no se escucha esto?
Vecna honestly looks like lumpy Voldemort ;-;
i love argyle that's all.
This video shares with so much secrets about stranger Things I mean like............
All of it is janes fault
Saw the first part, but the thumbnail is a huge spoiler man.....
uh
I ain't gonna lie the hair style of Johnathan looked like George Jung... I watched blow on Netflix right before stranger things season 4 came out and I was like damn !!! Johnathan looks like George jung!!! 🤣
I could tell millie didn’t shave her head because there was a lump on the top of her head (where she probably slicked back her hair) and it was a different shape from her head in s1
My name is walter heartwell white i live at 308 negra aroyal lane albaque new mexico????
The thumbnail is a spoiler tho
Damn spoiler alert would’ve been nice….. I have one episode left and now it’s ruined.
Lol dude said behind the scenes.
tratou-se para português
Did anyone notice? In season 1 eleven don’t know how to speak . how is it possible to before escaping?
She doesn’t eat the fruit roll up. She just brings it up faster. I think that’s cheating but she’s too young to criticize leave Brittany alone !!
4:09 say hi to my good buddy Walter, and his friend Jesse
Millie bobby looking fine af since season 1
wait... so the actor of Billy, lives in Austrailia?
men rlly spoiled the first vid
I watched this waiting for max's scene, i got clickbaited
I really wanted to see more of Sadie cause she did extremely well this season.
hi
"New Mexico was used to recreate Southern California" so why not just film in southern califonia then lol
4:09  **Breaking bad music intensifies**
Millie looks so old in private 😬 like 35 yrs
wait but- how did they hid millie's hair?
THANK GOD IT WAS A WIG
“Can we all just appreciate _____” YES BUT YALL DONT NEED TO GO “____ was great but-” it's comparing whether you mean it or not
Got I love that they don’t 100% rely on cgi which makes it feel even more like a movie from the 80s , when most creatures in movies were puppets and not special effects
4:09 my name is walter hartwell white, i live in 308 negra royal lane albulquerque new mexico 87104
Vecna should've been RIPPED or thin at least like the model shown 0:30. He looks kinda chubby and I couldnt take him seriously.
4:08 Breaking Bad reference???????
Waste of time watching this
Sadie Sink escape scene made my eye muscles sweat.  I'm not crying, you're crying.
How difficult is it to get the name of the actor playing the season’s villain right?! It’s BOWER, not Power. Yay professionalism!
Millie: *wants him to pick her up* Matthew: You are a bit bigger Millie: *chuckles* 🥲
God loves u have a great day!!!
Drake was loosing his mind with the fruit roll up challenge
But what is with the russians? i would like to know how they organized all that😅
watching behind the scenes makes the show less scary
im suprised they like new mexico because it is the worst state LOL
Excited for 8th
Bro Noah got jumped fr fr 💀💀
q lindo
after tiktok theory ppl see this video that vecna is not billy: O-O
Jamie’s performance was 👌🏻👌🏻👏👏👏
My favorite was when all the staff had to wear masks but the actors didn't haha That's the best
What's the point of killing so many kids?
I just spolied the show smh
i mean, it's Bower, but i guess Power is close enough, lol.
I swear the new mexico scene tripped me i thought i was watching breaking bad for a moment 😳
I was a student extra in the first episode xD. partial dream come true!
WOW LITHUANIA?? :D
i live in new mexico and its fun to see the sandia mountains in the show and right outside my bedroom
Cool
Ehm... A spoiler alert would have been nice.... Thanks for spoiling Vecna, I guess... -_-
YEAA NEW MEXICO
And we think it goes so easily
Tbh vecna is like voldemort since he doesn't have a nose-
Amazing, looks like much fun Working with them on set
the end of season 4 was not satisfactory, it wasnt finished, it wasnt done. we need more as soon as possible
I didn’t think this season was going to be as good as the 3rd but how wrong was I! Season 4 blew season 3 out the water. I didn’t move for over 7 hours just binged watched the lot. Can’t wait to see the final two.
I love how close will and milky are it’s so sweet
Max looks disgusting in the thumbnail
without kalian sadari ini spoiler
İlk ben çektim hüü
Sadie my goshhhh she’s AMAZING!!!!❤️
Uau!!!! incredible!!!!
their js a spoiler in the vecna thing
WE NEED MORE AND MORE NIKE COLLABS
Where is walter white
LA VIDEO QUE JATTENDAIIISS AAAAAHHH
Jamie was cast perfectly. The glossy eyes on top of his change in demeanor and how he holds himself when his true self is revealed was a complete 180.
Let's take a moment to appreciate jamie like he was the backbone of the season. He did such a wonderful job like 7 hrs just to get ready  man he deserves all the appreciation. Plus he also did  a great job as Henry like displaying him as ells well wisher and then the total opposite
It really goes without saying that ST4 is hitting on all cylinders. Particularly Sadie Sink; she delivered a masterclass in performance art! And I firmly believe that Vecna is going to go down as one of the most iconic monsters in pop culture! The team really did a brilliant job crafting this character.
Я многому научился, посмотрев видео, и получил много пользы.
Let’s get old town road to a 2B views ❤️
Let’s get old town road to a 2B views ❤️
“Proper golf technique”
Just feel like we need to get the actor’s name right. Repeat after me: JAMIE CAMPBELL BOWER.
Who else saw fruity challenge and thought something completely different
did noah and millie meet walter white at the roller rink
Swamp Thing vibes from Vecna
The thumbnail contains spoiler??
Stop the commentary I just want to watch
Jesus loves you and died for you turn to Jesus christ and spread his gospel not forcing k
I love u Millie
SPOILERS F U
Roller rinks in the 1980s were LIFE.
Ahh I want to be a actor now 😅
7hrs just does not seem very efficient, unless all vecna scenes were shot in one day.
Caleb micklofflin and Jamie Campbell power. Ffs
Too many characters, Will barely has any lines, argyle and Erica and Susie suck, I'd be fine with them dying, the russia scenes all suck, caleb has been bad from the start.  Also johnathan has been reduced to just a lame stoner. Pathetic. I wonder if covid is the reason that the characters are all separated. Which blows. And why is Robin suddenly a clumsy idiot? Poor writing. Just like the fact that they missed wills birthday which was a writing error
I loved the behind the scenes in Lithuania, oh wait there were none.
U should give out a Spoiler Alert. I’ve watched it all but some people haven’t and will be spoiled by this
You haven't showed behind the scenes :(
There be a family for life!
vecna looks like davy jones but without clothes and the underwater type feel
https://youtu.be/eNpkhX85yf0
there was no spoiler warning :( and i ruined it for myself
Not lying my Heart was Beating Very Fast For almost full Episode , The 4th One
My friends dad recorded some of the stranger things in Lithuania :)
Who else finished the season and wanted to see behind the scenes?
I live near were they were shooting and I saw them shooting
They took the piss with this series! And in a very good way! Stranger Things is something to watch, if you don't watch it, of course you'll say it's rubbish, just a bunch of kids/teenagers running around pretending there's monsters in other dimensions, like you'll think they're lying, but you should watch it! It's absolutely weird but weird in a brilliant way ❤️🌍
5:50 is it just me or Finn Wolfhard is looking like a Kopernik
Max scene and Running Up that Hill is my most favourite scene 😁
3:38 Harry 😂
Guys a fun fact is that the day they went to the rink you can see on the camera it say march 22nd and in season 2 when his mum was talking to him she brought up his birthday which is the 22nd of march
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
I couldn’t watch this season bru it was too malo 🤦🏾‍♀️ so I’m spoiling it
On think I how who wills brother is.......... Harry Styles
Remember, the Democrats want to arm all Ukrainians and make you pay for it with your taxes while they disarm law-abiding American citizens.  Also, Biden gave the Taliban in Afghanistan 20,000 American M4s for free after his disastrous withdrawal that got 30 Marines killed, but he wants to confiscate weapons from law-abiding Americans that they paid for with their hard-earned money.  Also, Fidel Castro Jr. (aka Justin Trudeau) just banned hand-guns in Canada, over a crime that DIDN'T EVEN HAPPEN IN CANADA, so you know that they're lying when they say that they only want to ban "military-style rifles."  Also, Democrats constantly scream that the police are "rayciss" and they're hunting black people, but yet they want to disarm all black people so only the police have guns.  OUR GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN HIJACKED BY RUSSIA.  FIGHT THE GOVERNMENT....cfgg
Democrats: "The police are "rayciss" and they're hunting black people!" Also Democrats: "We need to take away black people's guns so only the "rayciss" police have guns!"...gghh
Omg, they didn’t shave her hair for real, but it looked sooo real
I would just like to take a moment to appreciate the hard work and amazing acting of both Sadie Sink and David Harbour in this season, they made this season so good and made the entirety of the show 20 times better!
So good
I had a dream so Big And Loud
https://youtu.be/vHV4XB3ioC4😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Stranger things are so creepy because of the monster
can we all take a moment to appreciate david harbour? we all know that the russia parts wouldnt have been as good without him.
The thumbnail was really an iconic scene..
Is that Natalie Portman??
I love stranger things it’s one of my fav show!!
Their golf strokes are horrendous. He was honest about it.
I love hawkins after watching this season.
wow
I may sound like a b*tch but is it just me who doesn't like Winona Ryder/Joyce Byers, because she just angers me in every way.
#11 ON TRENDING
I knew it was a wig
one of the craziest seasons so far, i loved every minute so much — especially in episode 4 and 7!
https://youtu.be/2-3ZrGepPQ8 9
I can’t believe they tried to kill max. For sec they had me.
billy is so dam fine bring him back please!!
Awesome, no spoiler warning, thanks for ruining the big reveal with the first fact
What the hell is this creature Vecna🤯
bro this is completely a spoiler video. I've been spoiled.
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
July 1st can’t wait
I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE FOR THE FIRST ONE 👏
jellyyyyyy
This spoiled it for me
Sadie aka Max had me literally crying and rooting for her, i also cried when hopper finally reunited with wills mom! Best episode ever!! Please Duffer Brothers dont u dare mess this up! Im invested now.
Jamie Campbell BOWER LOL
نايس
wow
great to hear that they had fun in new Mexico as I live in new Mexico!
I live in New Mexico But I didn’t see them filming
Bro I wished that I want to alb when they were filming the roller skate scene bc I literally live 1 hour away from Albuquerque
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.   We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him.  We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins.   He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.  May God Bless you all! ♥️
i love this video, it’s so entertaining ❤️
Acts 10:34–43 (ESV): 34 So Peter opened his mouth and said: “Truly I understand that God shows no partiality, 35 but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. 36 As for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all), 37 you yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed: 38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.   39 And we are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree, 40 but God raised him on the third day and made him to appear, 41 not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. 42 And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead. 43 To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”
Whoever's reading this, you may feel like you lost it all, I pray that your days will get better, and the relationships with your work, your partner, or yourself gets better. You can do this!
Jamie’s performance was excellent
Bruh spoiler thumbnail wth
The whole crew in the background are real stars and Sadie :D
Jesus Christ loves you  https://youtu.be/BzClHiKHop4
The part where they saved Sadie from the upside down gave me chills, I had goosebumps the flashbacks and stuff that was an excellent piece of art the best part from the entire season
Ta a girl vacnas a girl
Am I the only one who feels like they can really start their own series after watching this?
Ok but the blip song was improvised?!???! Fucking brilliant. I was dying laughing
this season is absolutely amazing. the transitions in every episode were so creative, and the character development is awesome!every now and then i’d just ask myself “am i still watching stranger things? this feels like a big, great dramatic movie!”
God will come one day. "You also must be ready all the time, for the Son of Man will come when least expected."Matthew 24:44 (not trying to force you)
Fan theory- does agent orange have anything to do with how El got her powers, or Vecna. His father was in the war and could have been exposed to it. Agent orange is also a rainbow herbicide. I think there is a link
8:24 breaking bad
I was loving every character equally until episode 7. Jamie is my favourite now without any doubt 😍
Aaaaaa! I loved the skate rink growing up What a nostalgia masterpiece to include these things n ST: The Arcade(symbol of coolness-where quarters were stronger than cryptocurrency allowing amy cutie to win over the princess of their dreams by winning titular acclaim for all to see)  ((ie. TOTAL SCORE=999,999))👑 👑 👑

Charlie Heaton is English?!
Time is short   To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Elevens wig - saw it.  Billy filmed separately - wondered about it.   We notice more than you think, movie makers,.. 👍😆
Jamie absolutely killed it!!!
Vecna is weak as fuck.  ST is supposed to be about huge ass monsters, but lame comic book villians.
Why would they film in New Mexico to look like Southern California...isn't of just filming in California? I never understood that.
Cool video and I wonder how they Disguise there accents
Unpopular opinion but I thought this season was terrible 😥
If I'd ever watch this show it would only be for Sadie
Believe in Jesus 🙏 He loves u Believe in the Son of God Believe in the King of Kings and Lord of Lords
Wait. There's more?
i live in albuquerque newmexico too!
If you confess Jesus as Lord and believe He was raised from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9
Ummm could have put a spoiler warning ⚠️ for Venca….
The second Voldemort 🤧
‼️Spoiler ‼️
Yeah cause I actually thought she cut her hair but in a part of me I thought she didn’t so I’m happy she didn’t
STRANGER THINGS THEME REMIX-   https://youtu.be/LWnDSqeismw
spoilers..
The dedicaiton and talent in this cast is absolutely incredible.
Vecna was played by a Volturri vampire?!
4:09 Did I just hear... Albuquerque, New Mexico? How come Eleven didn't get Saul Goodman up in there when she was being questioned by the police?
Lithuania?
Millies acting scenes especially the bulling part was so realistic. Her and that iconic Sadie sink floating scene was epic.
Jamie Campbells acting skills were so good this season. I remember him from mortal instruments.
Shoutout to the makeup crew though!
Hey there❤️, you should Repent for your sins (ask God for forgiveness and turn away from sin) and “If you openly declare that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭10:9‬ ‭NLT You are saved by Faith in Jesus Christ  Remember to pick up your cross daily and follow Jesus. Also don’t forget to read the Bible and pray daily. Jesus loves you, but not your sins. Jesus is coming back, believe to be saved. I love you God bless you❤️
pizza van guy with the long hair has huge Mike Myers vibes, might be next Austin Powers 👍
10 Of The World's Funniest One Liners!  1. I can handle pain until it hurts. 2. I don't suffer from insanity; I enjoy every minute of it. 3. The word "gullible" isn't in the dictionary. 4.

Editorial: Perhaps the world's most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
I just now realized the biggest  plot hole , for some reason while is summer vacation in California is is winter in Russia.😭😭😭😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It explains it all why vecna  didn’t kill creel because vecna is his son
Instead of talking about Millie why don't we talk about Noah and Sadie. Season 4 was Noah and Sadie's season. They are amazing actors
I don't know who tha fk any1 is an im new to tha show too, but I've had a blast watching it bk to bk an I love all the characters ❤ everytime I think that ones my fav one of the characters does sm insane acting,  think ur all grand....
Bothhh of the girrllsss ELLL AND MAXXX SLAAAYYYY 💖💖💖💖💖
‏His voice is beautiful, he feels great He sings in Arabic and yet the feeling will reach you ‏https://youtube.com/channel/UC6NARJGywqLUDvwFfoBkXzA
im confused by the thing about them being split up. they were split in this season aswell
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates— 🟥
4:47 now we know she made it back home
New Video released https://youtube.com/shorts/CFW7GD3ZpLs?feature=share
sadie float
Rewatching seasons 1-3 now. Will be watching season 4a soon. Thanks for the fun backstory!
getting made up for the Vecna look is already itself a half day's work.....
Wow 😲 😍😍😍💝🥰 super series stranger things / super 👍 😎 characters  11, jeen  and Mike , hoper,  will,  max,  Dustin, Steeb, Johnthan, Robin, Nancy / 😍😍  I liked all character and Netflix  odiunce  thanks 🙏👍
Spoiler ALERT !!!
Can’t wait for part 2!!! 7/1
John 14:6 .Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
I knew those deserts and rink looked familiar!!! I can't believe it... I was so close, but yet, so far away😭
It really goes without saying that ST4 is hitting on all cylinders. Particularly Sadie Sink; she delivered a masterclass in performance art! And I firmly believe that Vecna is going to go down as one of the most iconic monsters in pop culture! The team really did a brilliant job crafting this character.
All those Vecna practical effects and they still lathered 6 tons of CGI over it so it looks just like CG
The only I don't get is why they had to put that wig on Noah to make him look he still 10 yo, didn't he grow out of it at this age?
Even if Millie puts a wig on, her characters hair is shaved so in the next episodes and other seasons, she's going to have short hair, basically going back to season 2 hair. Millie has long hair so she's going to have wear a wig for the rest of her time on stranger things, unless they do a time jump.
SADIE IS THE BEST !!!!!!!!!!
I’m surprised that Campbell also played vecna. I just feel like they would have used someone else for that
4:08 did they bought some meth from heisenberg?
Just started the first episode of season 4!  Still love that 80s vibe so much
Would be interesting to know if covid made the decision of 3 separate groups with 3 different story’s or was this always the plan? Either way it works.. hope to see them altogether in the final parts.
hello
4:12 huh didnt notice everyone had a facemask besides the actors
My name is Walter Hartwell White, I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane 4:09
damn 3:00 they filmed the movey on a phone?
How about a big SPOILER ALERT in your title or thumbnail
The acting this season was crazy good!
so where is the behind the scenes from s4 ep4 ? bcs your Thumbnail there is but i can't find in the video..................................
So that Billy and Max scene was taped in different sets? It makes me think how great of ant actress Sadie is.
4:09 breaking bad reference
What about Jezzy ( shown as Steve in stranger things) .  So much underrated in Instagram he even didn't have his blue tick.
why the thumbnails that have spoilers tho
I’ll never forget ever
HOLYSHIT
Remember God loves you♥️! John 3:16  For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. Please repent, change your life around and live for Him🙏🙏. He is coming back soon🥳🤗...........
0:20
Did I miss the thumbnail part? 🤔
BROOOO WHATTTT I LIVE IN LITHUAINIA AND IK ITS NOT A BIG COUNTRY ITS QUITE SMALL AND I WAS REALLY SUPRISED THAT THEY ACTUALLY FILMED HERE, DAMN THATS SICK i was to lazy to make all of the text not caps, i stil love the fact that they actually filmed here its a big surprise...
Wheres the thumbnail
Why are there so many duplicate comments? Literally copy and pasted..?
2:12
Joyce Season 1: Where is Will? Season 2: Why is Will? Seasons 3 & 4: Who is Will?
Litt🔥🔥🔥
The idea of Will being gay was set in stone since the Duffer Brothers wrote the Montauk bible. They even mention it in the first episode of the first season.  The idea of Will liking Mike has been a thing since season 2 - the official script (available online, submitted to the Emmys for consideration) shows the snowball scene, Will looking at Mike the entire time he's "dancing awkwardly with random girl" - this idea was amplified in season 3 when Mike made that remark that he doesn't like girls and season 4 basically confirms the long-thought fan theory that he has a crush on Mike, also the painting is for Mike. Mike is the only person, (outside of Family) who will trusts - they met on the first day of kindergarten and it was only a matter of time before one fell for the other.  Will literally physically rejecting the girl and looked disgusted 😂
After this I have a huge huge crush on Sadie sink
I love Mille but Jamie should also get the appreciation he deserves
yall r so dramatic. everyone did an amazing job this season! EVERYONE. not just one person lmao
is it just me or Charlie Heaton actually looks like Harry Styles-
Eddie Munson(Joseph Quinn) this season was great❤
https://youtu.be/8TMpsujIC4I
I loved the part where Hoppers leg was hit badly
I thought they’ll talk about max scene 🤣🤣 that’s why I came 💀
Still don't understand why they have to wear masks outside... Makes little sense.
Guys: Stop saying "Everyone's talking about Millie, but what about this actor/actress?"! Nobody is talking about Millie!!
Vecna's monster makeup took longer than Milli's wig 🤦‍♂️
Vecna is so scary
Voldemort’s cousin
“Millie takes the longest getting ready”:😌💆‍♀️🧑‍🦲 Jamie:👱🏻⏭7️⃣👹🕷
I knida wish Max died in the upside down and that would have made an even bigger impact and would have made a bigger cliffhanger imo
💓
In the 🛼 scene the kid 🎥 shows a time stamp of May 22 86, aka Wills bday
I can't believe that they used phone to shoot
I’m glad she didn’t have to shave her hair again still looked good
Millie's wig was so convincing
Man i was crying just like you 😭😭
cant wait for part 2
They probably didn't use CGI for the golf ball scene. Just editing. Easier, cheaper and more realistic than creating a fake ball perfectly landing.
They waited too long and the cast is too old. Season 4 is not that good.
Finally it’s here.  https://youtu.be/DTT7nYrn0aY
As a person who had to have their head shaved super traumatically at a young age, my heart was SHATTERED when I saw Millie bald again!! I’m so glad to hear it was a wig 💞
666k views
How is vecna able to access the human world freely without opening the gate of the upside down world? I mean for the mind frayer or Demo-beings in S1-S3 you have somone who tempered with the portal so that makes sense.
Didn't expect Vecna to be this fine.
The whole season 4 is a masterpiece 👌
The one take scene is phenomenal!
4:12 ALBERQUERQUE BRO WHERES WALTER AND JESSE
Jamie had to stay in a conditioned tents throughout scene breaks, I guess he really did like it cold
ok is it just me or anyone else think vecna reallly looks like comic book version of gorr the god butcher?
That shooting scene really escalated fast
I love this cast so much 😆
What? Naked Billy?
DEAR BILLY WAS THE BEST EPISODE OF ALL TIME! THANK YOU SADIE SINK!!
steve, dustin, max carried mannn. they were my fav this season. and ofc.. special mention for eddie, eleven, robin, nancy
Best part of this behind the scene video is when Sadie was being hoisted up for the vecna scene. 👏🏼. 👏🏼. 👏🏼.
Great season so far. Hope they nail part 2
so... he had to take ~7 hours to transform into Vecna.... and THEN go act for however many hours??? wow
The intro was ironic cuz were running up that hill is a feature song in the stranger things
Why did i watch this not expecting spoilers! Please give a FRIGGIN disclaimer!!
I’m glad they didn’t cut her hair off
#13 makes no sense to me…this is EASILY the most split up they’ve ever been. 😂
The acting this season was crazy good!
that blip scene had my dying so I has to post about it on snapchat 😂😂
wait the Billy and Max scene?! that's amazing because Sadie and Dacre really captured that emotion and there's no one there to act with? amazing!
最高ー！！！！
what the actual hell bro? couldnt have said spoiler alert? horrible channel
“can we talk about the other actors, all the comments are about millie” ..then talk about them?? why are you guys always trying to bring millie into things, if you want to compliment the other actors then do it without bringing millie down. i know that most of the people who are making these comments are minors though so it’s hard to really get mad at them, but please you’d think preteens would at least be a bit more emotionally intelligent. holyyyy shit.
the only thing that they missed was the fact that the day they were filming angela get hit by the rollerskates, it was Will Byer's birthday..lol
From what I've heard (might need a fact check) young El in st4 is actually a completely different actor besides Millie.
Bruh this guys audio is horrible. Get a better microphone fuckface
Why did I watched this? I havent finish watching
I just love them all so much!🦋🖤
Why is Millie using her American accent when they aren’t filming???
Vecna need his own movie 😭😭😭😭
Vecna is kinda cool ngl 🤣😂
Bro I went to the roller king place I live in belen New Mexico
Where’s my boy? What’s wrong with my boy? Is my boy at home? I have a boy??
Can they just give Will more than 2 lines..
I think Vecna is kinda hot (and I mean Vecna not no.1) Please tell me I'm not the only one 💀
Is it really necessary to have two unskippable ads before each one? Geez
Sadie is amazing season
When they say "he was coated with jelly" they mean KY Jelly its a stable of effects in tv show and movies ha
I love you millie bobby brown and sadie sink  ilove youre moive starenger things i rally l love it
They filmed in Lithuania
Jamie Campbell BOWER, not Power 😅🤣
2:54 can we just appreciate how this guy was recording a movie with his phone
Jamie’s performance was excellent, perfectly gave off that totally off the rails yet hollow inside creepy vibe when he talks to eleven. I thought that was perfect
I’ll kill anybody in the roll up challenge Pull up millie
i was thinking abt breaking bad whenever i saw that desert lol
At 4:48 it looks like a scene that’s gonna be in part 2, they’re in eleven & hoppers old house
Dont the prostetic hurt when getting taken off
I liked Joyce and Murray in the Alaska/Russian scenes. The kids were great, but give some credit to the adults acting too. Winona has her character down pat.
Idk why seeing brenner with a mask is kinda funny
why did they release it now
This is the second bts video I watched which uses the Sadie Sink scene as a thumbnail but it is not in the video. I'm quite disappointed.
I've never seen the show but I know the song.  This scene just left me in tears.
You can REALLY tell that 11 is wearing a bald cap/wig. Her head looks like an egg
Spoilers for this comment kind of. I just share theories.  . . . . . I think that it’ll start episode 8 with Nancy scene. I think she’ll snap back or something because vecna was just trying to show them the real thing the story. I think hopper and Joyce and them will find a plane outside the prison camp and I forgot the other dudes name, the Russian but he’ll probably come or say I think I should just stay, or possibly he gets shot. They get el a way to go back. And I think eventually el will meet vecna, and vecna will remember her. It’s so crazy to imagine then fighting so much in the show. Idk what would happen to vecna the cats said it would be a crazy ending the duffer bothers did for the last two episodes but I have no idea what it will be honestly
Of topic kinda but if Dustin dies in season 5 I will literally throw my remote to my tv
Lets just be honest, Mike did not age as well as we thought he would. (•_•)

Can we take a moment to appreciate all of the cast. The acting in this season is so amazing.
What about hop and joyce
Why couldn’t she just wear a wig in season 1?
Me falto ver mas amor en esta temporada de mike con su novia once
Lol #1 is Vecna hahaha
2:21 "one of the biggest rubik's cube challenges of my directing career"  Me: Being happy as I was speedsolving a few cubes as he said that😂😁
It's BOWER, not power but I can't wait to see part 2!
millie deserve a emmy for her performace in this season
Billy looked way better with his 90’s hair look haha no offense
I loved the blip blip scene! 🤣
watching the first episode i didn’t think it was going to be good, but omg they did amazing this season and really pulled through !
I truly thought she shaved her head again, that wig was so convincing to me
We all want more of Billy!!!!!
not be fucked up or anything cuz i rlly love sadie and i love her as max dont get me wrong but her acting..? 💀
2:53 Are they filming the show with a phone? 😂
spoilers warning u dipshithead
Mille has a android? wow with the millions of dollars she makes i would have thought she'd have a iphone 13 rn
idk why but just hearing millie's normal voice instead of el's is just amazing to me because of how used i am to el's
THEY WERE IN NEW MEXICO??? NO ONE TOLD ME
I came here specifically to find out whether or not they made millie shave her hair again. That's a damn good wig
This is so cool wow
Spoiler Warning please right in the beginning man!!
I think Sadie Sink stole that whole season!
Sadie did phenomenal this Season!! 💯👏❤️
1:20 “The broken house was a real set (that) they built on a bluescreen.” Huh?
All oh them
Easily the best so far
its so cool to also hear this 7:56
Loved that vecna wasn’t cgi, gave the whole feel to be real.
its so cool tghat they filmed at the roller rink in my city.
Jesus loves you
The acting was great! But i just wish people could still film in real places, like this so easily could have been filmed in a real semetary
This is honestly the first season Stranger Things has illustrated some depth and meaning in its story and most scenes. I think this season finally is paying off to the tone, mystery and horror that were uniquely set in the first season which we haven't seen in a long time. It's not always about getting bigger and bigger with the scope and blowing colours and aesthetic like in season 3 but it is staying loyal to the elements that made the show triumph in the first place with a little more creativity. The show's also starting to have a main theme of overcoming trauma, all the characters are traumatized in their own way and eventually they have to fight the "demons" of their past by fighting this demon. Eleven has to eventually return to her past that she's trying to stay away from to overcome it and get back her powers and get strong again. I think Vecna is not only looking for children who have things that happened in their lives but especially the ones who remain affected by it, got weakened and lost all hope or will to continue anymore, they haven't yet made ammends with their past. Max has been like this all the way before Billy's death, his death just added more to the mixture. In the face of depression and death (Vecna), Max has to give another reason why she is still living and that is by remembering all her friends and the lighter moments in her life that can (with hope) overshadow the darker ones. Max escaping Vecna was truly earned and not forced like other moments in previous season(s), it's just an indication of the great work the creators have put into theme construction and consistency.
Hate when the video thumbnail has nothing to do with the video 🙄
I remember going to Roller King for a Christmas party last year! It was really fun, even though I slipped a few times 😅
Omg , the amount of effort put into this season is phenomenal!! Big clap on the backs on everyone who have made this season the best ever! 🌟🌟🌟
Young eleven (Mattie Blair) was so good too, it’s crazy how similar she and Millie are
I THOUGHT VECNA WAS CGI WHAT THE HECK WOW
As someone from New Mexico, I just feel amazing. Knowing Millie Bobby Brown and Finn Wolfhard have been to New Mexico is just 🤌🏻
I can't imagine being in that prosthetic Vecna get up. Like what do you do when you have to take a fat shit or piss?
Jesus died for our sins so that we can go to heaven. He payed our price. Put your trust in Jesus Christ and he will grant you the gift of heaven.
Season 4 DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!!!!  It will be an epic season 5!!!!!
4:34 what that mouth do Millie?😩😏
In season 4 episode 6 when Eleven is playing with the Plinko game in the rainbow room and One is talking to her, she drops one of the pucks down and it lands in number 6 upright. In that shot, you can see 4, 5, and 6 are like that. 7 is missing and 8 is laying flat. A little further in that scene and one drops his directly down flat on 1 just like 8. Back in season 2 episode 7 you get the feeling that 8 is kinda bad and is using bad memories and hate to fuel her powers. One told Eleven that she needed to channel “something that made him sad and also angry” the same exact thing eight told eleven to do. I feel like eight and One are connected and that she will return. Me and my friends figured this out together
Is it me, or has Winona had some work done?
ok but can we please speak on Sadie’s performance this season?? girl deserves an Emmy or something.
this season.. I mean it ALL TIED TOGETHER so well I WAS SPEACHLESS. It was amazing to see more of Elevens backstory, and everyones acting was INCREDIBLE as usual :)
who the heck is jamie campbell power? it’s jamie campbell bower
Noah really know hows to make different faces
0:25 According to all the Youtube Professional Commenters it's CGI. Y'know, the one who've never touched a modelling program in their lives.
Loved this season, but I was so tired of that long haired California guy seriously he was badly written
Is that a breaking bad reference
I hope they filmed the Billy scene a long time ago because Covid restrictions shouldn’t still be a problem
Love watching these behind the scenes 🥺
In the one take scene, it took them about 40 minutes to redo the set between every take and it took them 5 takes.
There is not a single character in this show I don't love! They are all great actors! I wish stranger things could go on forever
I live in Albuquerque
By “last episode for season 4” do you mean for volume one or two?
Vecna does not even Look close to creepy he looks Goofy asf 💀
I wanna see Stranger Things behind the scenes with Max episode four
Bro said Caleb mcglafin
Where is the spoiler warning!!!
Now Lucas is that subway surf guy
DID ANYONE REALIZE WTVR HE IS SPEAKING IN THIS VID IS ALLLLLL TAKEN FROM INTERVIEWS🤣😭🤌🏻
Those golf lessons didn't help🤣
i accidentally spoiled myself 🥲
Love 😘😘
season 4 & 2 are the best
“Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand." ~ Isaiah 41:10”❤️✝️
this show is pretty decent, imo nothing incredible, but pretty solid, for sure
So Jamie is vecna???
I literally live in New Mexico
The last 30 min in episod 7 was just incredible.
I wouldt be surprised in 20 years from now we will see the group back in older version just like the movie I.T. The duffers are to the Tee with 80s film 🎥 and we will see them.
I am loving this season so far.  Its darker and the tone is bit more serious, but very well written.  There are so many Easter eggs too.  I’m having fun spotting all of them.  I just noticed that Dr. Brennon looks a lot like director David Cronenberg and Vecna’s hands look like Pumpkinhead’s.  And Vecna cocoons his victims much like the Xenos do in Aliens.
can we all take a moment to appreciate david harbour? we all know that the russia parts wouldnt have been as good without him.
you guys are all talking about millie and she was great but Sadie literally carried season 4 (no hate to millie)
this feels illegally early
Me who lives in New Mexico
Okay I gotta admit that water balloon prank was pretty funny. Hope he took it in stride
VECNA AND HIS LAIR WEREN'T CGI?!!?!?!? I assumed they were the entire time!!!! That is some SERIOUSLY impressive work!!!! And the shaved hair was a wig?!?! Utterly fooled me!!
can we talk about how there was lithuanian cast in st s4
um hello you literally just spoiled it for me . wtf... I had three episodes left
Vecna deserves the emmy this year... ❤️🥵🔥
Thumbnail wasn’t in the video. Too bad I can’t dislike.
1:27 The same intensity in his eyes that was there when 001 went bad. It's so clear they're the same person now!
Honestly I was pretty unimpressed with vecna’s monster design. It was fine but definitely not worth the 7 hours of application
Fun fact:Dustin and suzie are called the most cute couple but we haven’t seen them together yet!
This isn 't "behind the scenes"...
These newcomers killed it this season. Eddie is my new favorite addition to the gang while Vecna is my boo thang! Why am I in love with Vecna? Because he reminds me of a Strigori mixed with the Boogie Man & he kills teenagers. Don’t know why but that’s my shit 🤣🤦🏽‍♀️  Vecna is just outright bad-ass & he’s not even trying yet. I can’t wait for the second half of season 4. It’s been my favorite.
Sadie ATE this season !!
Bakwas bakchodi
4:08 WHERE NOW
on-cam: will third wheeling el and mike off-cam: finn third wheeling millie and noah
Sadie 💕
4:09 jesse we have to rollerskate
This franchise is sick, as in good!
i had the biggest like cry fest when Billy was in the scene
Cam i just say that I never saw the Scene where 001 gets turned into Vecna So um New thing
Spoiler alert!
I mean, ST is a masterpiece, they are improving every season, Duffer brothers, actors and production team made an incredible work. ❤️🕰🏚🪆🛼❤️
I really love this behind the scenes look, Vecna is one of the scariest villains so far, in that he feeds off of your depression and anxiety.
here before this blow up
I'm in love with Sadie
Hi i loved this
Bin waiting for this one 🔥
Sadie carried the first part of this season with episode 4 alone
dacre looks like Zac efron
Love ❤️
the scenes with El in Hawkins' lab are a bit boring, they could have spent more time with Will and Jonathan
Daaaaamn 4:40 millie lookin THICC!!!!
yukjykuyku jvj
Millie is amazing but let’s take a moment to appreciate Jamie. He endured 7 hours of prosthetic and acted amazingly under all that prosthetic which was probably no doubt really hot.
Can we   talk about the other actors all the comments are about Millie, yes Millie is amazing but let's appreciate all the other actors
This season of ST is my favorite one. I still can't get over E7. They left us on a major cliffhanger that's a huge part of the story. This season is unlike any of the other seasons and it's a lot creepier and I think that's one reason why I love this season.
I hate ou the thumbnail spoiled it for me
show how Steve harringtons hair is done
millie's performance in stranger things 3 and 4 was the best
Everyone is talking about Millie but can we recognize Sadie Sink, & Noah Schnapp for their amazing performances this season!? Edit: 5k likes and controversy wowwwwww!
Wanna see Steve is gonna die with proofs https://youtu.be/9DS2gf-zbdU
I saw in one part that they were filming and recording with a phone I always thought it would be filmed with a camera. I might be wrong though
Lithuania! 🇱🇹🥳
Millie is amazing but let’s take a moment to appreciate Jamie. He endured 7 hours of prosthetic and acted amazingly under all that prosthetic which was probably no doubt really hot.
Who else loves stranger things
Millie nailed it this season. I mean she's been great since the beginning. But season 4 is just mind blowing. Millie, Joyce, hopper - these three are the best. A proper A tier. Then comes sadie, nancy, Steve and Dustin. And tbh will, mike and rest of the main character wasn't that shiny. Maybe it's because they're supposed to be like that. Idk, Still I love all of them. Can't wait for volume 2🔥
Where is this scene from preview?
Love this show so much😭
This is so beautiful. I need 80minutes more of these!
4:09 My name is Walter hartwell white
i feel like you can see that the prosthetics guy also worked on game of thrones, vecna has definitely some white walker vibes
What about the thumbnail?😐
Ok but like team Jonathan or Steve 😛
gfdjdufhdy
The acting this season was crazy good!
Wow I'm so early😭
Honestly, Stranger Things is the best show I have ever watched. (You do you if you like any other shows, this is just my opinion)
Where the green screen scene in the thumbnail?
Millie went through so much pain and exhaustion in stranger things, she is such a legend.
Life is, after all, a gift.....
I'm looking forward to watching this season, let's good. #friendsdontlie
Millie is a legend for all the stunts.
Ummmm, Stranger Things were filmed in my Hometown Douglasville,  GA!!! Especially the scene at the movie video store scene!!!
WE LOVE STRANGER THINGS <3
I loved the first volume of season 4 it was SOO good. Love to see the hard work behind it 👏🏽💛💛
Um hi?
Mille did her best performance on Stranger Things
Amazing video 👌
Love your vids man
Millie's shaved hair this season looked convincing, luckily they didn't have her shave her head again.
