Thanks so much for putting this up WSL

The waves looked good, but a commentator claimed it was double overhead. Come on.
Well, back to the typical ridiculous overscoring of Marks.
I've muted the sound. Much better.
Pitiful commentary. Like  a whole lot of middle aged hipsters trying to sound relevant.
SO GREAT to have Ronnie Blakey back in the booth. Easily the best anchor, WAY better than the inane ramblings from Turpel, Palmateer etc.
It was awesome having you guys on country on opening ceremony day!! Thanks Media for all the photos taken of all us indigenous surfers yeww
I gotta say Seth got Robbed opening wave scores should have been swapped
Can someone please explain to me, what do the guys mean when they say that there isn't any set waves to ride,
Bring back the live chat!
Commentators calling great turns all over the place when in reality only  12 or so of surfers did great turns out there.
The waves looked good, but a commentator claimed it was double overhead. Come on.
I can’t remember who or where, but I saw someone talking smack recently on a broadcast or a podcast, and they said “Kelly will never win another CT heat”. I didn’t agree with that, and I’m stoked to be right! Whoever you are - “EAT IT” 😂☝🏽
Ayoooo
