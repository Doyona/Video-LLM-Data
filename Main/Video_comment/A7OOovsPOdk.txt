This was the day the war turned hot. Now america has boots on the ground. But this isn't a "world war"
Langley did Rossiya a disservice 😂 (rude American)
Great day in history!  Pride of the russian "navy"  converted  into an anchor.

Turkish Black Sea fleet gets stronger with every ship that sinks. Erdoğan is the best chess player so far

IMO Russia is getting what they deserve, considering they started this mess.
This is like playing the game Battleship.. G10 "it's a hit".. except this is more than a game 🤔
"It sunk because the stuff on board caught fire."   Sure. Probably just normal preparations before reallocating the vessel into the submarine fleet.  Russia: there's a big difference between a "phase 2" and a "plan B," and we're all aware of it.

Russia reports one dead sailor in the accident
It did not sink! Only promoted to submarine comrades!
USA is playing with fire, it is asking for its own destruction, USA targeting of Moskva ship is Russia's "Pearl Harbor", retaliation is next. It has now been revealed that the US military ran the entire operation to sink the Moskva, including running the tracking of the ship via a P-8 Poseidon surveillance aircraft, which then handed off fire solutions to the Ukrainians who were all trained by the US military as well. Thus, the United States provided the weapons, the training, the tracking and the fire solution to sink the Moskva.  By sinking the Moskva, the US just handed Putin something akin to "Russia's Pearl Harbor moment," in which Putin can claim to his people that the USA initiated an attack on the Russian Navy, sinking one of their ships and killing hundreds of their people. This news has, of course, been paraded all across Russian media, driving domestic support for Putin even higher than before.  Just like with Pearl Harbor in the United States, the people of Russia are now demanding "payback" from the aggressors, whom they see as the United States. In effect, the USA just handed Putin the final piece of the puzzle that he needs to launch retaliatory nuclear strikes against the West.
40 year old 'flag ship' being towed to port sinks? How bad is the Russian fleet - That's not good. Time to call in their aircraft carrier .... {yuk yuk yuk}
The officers left but the sailors died. A lot of families want answers they are unlikely to get.
This flagship is ready for the special underwater operation in the blacksea now. 🇹🇷🇺🇦
hope the rest of them sink...
Putin is mocking God by saying that his war is a holy war...God will not be mocked.
L + Ratio
This ship was most regarded in the military community for its provocative missile arrangement. It was considered a floating symbol of openly hostile posturing and now it rests on the ocean floor. "Hope it was ensured"
MOKVA
Ok Sorry
Die Schlachtschiffe von den Russen müssen alle Blubb Blubb machen.🎳🔥🎳
Ok See as
Bravo Ukraine. Next target should be the Kremlin
Please don’t said fake news any more!!!!!  U can see all these foto are all “” photo montage”””””Coioni !!!!!
Ukraine just wanted to explain to Putin what a special military operation means.
PHOTOS? NONE BULLSHIT
uraaaaaaaaaa
Moskva Sank(t) Petersburg !!!   Slaivi Ukrayini ! Glory to Ukraine 🇺🇦
The Moskva didn't sunk, they only programmed their missiles *return to sender* ,,, so no foreign enemy screwed the Russian Navy they fully screwed themself https://youtu.be/aLv-W9eeJsE
Rihanna plan a couple of missiles on top of Putin's house. And just tell him we're not there we don't know what's going on. It would only serve him right and hopefully he's in there
History repeats itself https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcu-FBdgUK4
The Russian Moskva Warship was just a "Coffee Ship" used only for transporting coffee. Upgraded with stainless steel screen doors. It's now a new tourist attraction for the fishes.
Ukraine must surrender and begin occupational talks.
Russia has lost a ship. Ukraine is losing entire cities.
Parabéns Ucrânia pelo seu tiro certeiro no mega cruzador Moscou. Foi a distância de 65 milhas ou 100 km de Odessa. Foi um grande tiro para ficar na história das guerras navais.

Japanese Battle Flagship ''Yamato'' was hit, destroyed & sunk in April 7, 1945 right at the end of WW2 they lost her! The Pride of the Emperor of Japan's Naval might, sunk just a couple of months before Hiroshima & Nagasaki were hit. It is such a symbolic Victory! The Pride of Russian Naval Flagship. Named after The Capital, Kremlin resides, D.O.D, K.G.B head offices. $750 plus Million & I say a big plus as it was carrying Nukes! I hate when they call Nukes ''Tactical''... What's tactical about it. The guidance systems are the same, they have it set for an Air Burst Detonation, no different to the mechanisms installed by Brittan to explode at a specific altitude{Either Timer & or remote) Nothing Tactical about scorched got damn earth...  Humans are so stupid & forget so eazy! We, the world said never again but yet, just 80 or so years later. We have a dictator committing mass war crimes & we do NOTHING! Military industrial Complex has made enough money to be able to get in there & fix it, & foot the bill..... ''Never Again???!'' Or does that only count when Good Men actually act! Western Coalition of the Willing to take down this Russian invaders! What are we waiting for, lets go liberate Ukraine! Immediate NATO Members for @/ukraine, @/finland, @/sweeden!
Stormy weather has sunk the Russian armada like Spanish Armada was sunk by a storm to decapitate the Iberian empire. Now Russia too will be decapitated

Congratulation Ukraine, well done;) Russia coming back there should be in 1917 isolated from entire world this fashist
do America and nato not have the guts to fight Russia.,.?? haha,., Russian Putin is the best
Believe what one will, is it any wonder why many don’t believe seeing how false preachers preach, failing teaching God’s Word? Russia’s Orthodox Church, Putin, a strong supporter of told this is a holy war,never to back down from. Here, politicians touting support from evangelical churches for support, when knowing these earthly Kingdoms, ( governments) are no part of God’s Kingdom Satan is now ruler over these Kingdoms, ( governments) Read  John 14:30, the ruler of this world is coming,Jesus saying having no hold on him. Now read Rev.22:7-12 see how Satan was cast out of the heavenly realm, to the earth. So, if Satan is now ruling, why would leaders leading seekers of God’s truth   be encouraging them to give support to Satans arrangement? Is it not God’s Kingdom we pray to come and do here on earth what had been in heaven? Daniel 2:44 is now that foretold prophecy that’s in affect. All those being lovers of God, wanting to do his will are asked to reason together, learning those things our Heavenly Father is wanting us to learn. All are loved, asking to to as told in John 17:3 In truth, it’s a spiritual war, as from mankind’s beginning has. Now fulfillment of prophecy as told in Daniel 2:44 we’re seeing the Lord’s Prayer being answered. God’s purpose’s will never be thwarted by anything or one, this earth was created to be mankind’s paradise home, we can read that in Isaiah 45:18-21. Isaiah 43:10 tells how God, who’s name is Jehovah as can be found in Psalm 83:18 being God’s name., the name we pray be honoured in the Lord’s Prayer. Scriptures teach us, we have faithful followers offering to freely assist seekers what they message is our God and Heavenly Father is wanting us to know. Those days  foretold, long awaited are now upon us, being fulfilled  Read what signs said to watch for marking those days, when doing so all can readily see we’re now in them. They are; 2 Timothy 3:1-5, Matthew 24:3-5,6-24, 2 Peter 3:3, Ephesians 2:2,, The days could not be more urgent than any other time in all of mankind’s history, for the time for a new beginning has arrived, there now is a heavy shaking out from among  the righteous and disobedient ones refusing and excepting  God’s love.
The lines on this woman's face are getting deeper since George Galloway's first comment. She's a true shill.

It hasn’t sunk its performing a special underwater operation according to Putin LOL
🤣 they don't like it up them, transferred to submarine class. How ironic to be told to f off snake island and then go to bottom of sea. Nuremberg 2 neck stretching will be good.

Tosi hyä että on pohjassa..jes
That is cool
Caught Russia with there pants down lol
May St Faustina and St John Paul II intercede with the Divine Mercy to protect Mariupol defenders and Kharkiv citizens. May Putin be removed from office and tried for war crimes. May St Michael, Raphael and Gabriel protect the skies over these cities. May NATO wake up from its slumber and offer effective help.

American tax payers did not have a say to where the money whent, we are told to work and pay taxes, then we are taxed on money we worked for then we are taxed to spend the money then when we die our family members have to pay taxes on money that is already taxed and our funerals.

мы все надеемся, что Россия победит, рассеять надежду быстро и точно. По 1. Разблокируйте главный ключ, чтобы завершить битву с главной целью, сфокусированной, быстрой, точной, и в первую очередь Соединенными Штатами, вторым Израилем, третьей Великобританией и четвертой Австралией, страны должны и должны быть уничтожены одновременно. как основной источник проблем во всем мире, который обязательно и бесспорно калечить. 2. Непосредственно во всех ближайших европейских странах Россия как союзник по НАТО, после присоединения к Америке в сближении с Израилем, готова только обороняться, не решаясь нападать или искать неприятности с Россией, изначально способствуя обустройству мирового баланса и мира во всем мире .

Limited ships allowed to pass through the Turkish gates into the Black Sea and no more Russian war ships. The Moskva was not just the most powerful ship in the fleet, it was the command ship for the Russian Black Sea fleet! A major blow to the Russian effort to control the Black Sea and all of its ports, gas resources, and sea to ground attacks.
They all live in a yellow submarine. At the bottom of the black sea
Even if all Russians ship sink, it will NEVER be enough to pay for the thousands of lives killed in Putin's war

faço alguns videos avisando sobre um Mega Tsunami, a Russia tem armamento para criar os Mega Tsunamis, mas sobre a 3 guerra, haverá uma inversão Alienigena, como explico no meu instagram.  o Pior não foi afundar o navio tecnologicamente armado. mas alguém acreditar que foi um país pobre de armamento conseguir atingir o navio. até ofende a inteligência das pessoas. mas aguardem os próximos capitulos dessa história. a intervenção vem. existem muitas vidas no planeta, para apenas uma raça acabar com tudo. e isso não será permitido.

it was a "special munitions explosion"

Israel & France should help & do more with the clashes between Russia and Ukraine & help the Russian civilians who are suffering with this war.
sunk? LOL.................
We in Australia are sponsoring a military nationalist coup. Our “aid” which has largely been from NATO, but Australia jointing in, about to help the Ukraine nationalists flatten the Donbas region having been firing at it since 2014,  and then our recruited terrorists would proceed over the Russian border.Having tried the peaceful option for 7 years with Minsk II, continually blocked by Washington, Russia eventually had to remove NATO (weaponry proxy run by the fascist coup) by force for their own imminent security threat. From Australia and in full support of Russia. I have visited Ukraine 20 times in the last 10 years and saw with my own eyes the rise of fascism there sponsored by the US and armed by NATO, and it is abysmal how our media in Australia are framing everything as the diametric opposite of what is actually happening. The public building shelling is by nationalists attacking their own Ukrainian public, not the Russian military who are doing all they can to end this, which started in 2014 and not this year when the cameras turned on. All sponsored by Washington for economic purposes, similar to last coups elsewhere. The gear we are sending there will largely be blocked by Russia’s operations, but what reaches Ukraine will land in the hands of the fascists coup, and used for violence against the ordinary Ukranian public. We are sponsoring a coup and our Australia public are being atrociously mislead I’m sorry to report.
Admiring the president and the Ukrainian army for his patriotism and steadfastness, Putin because of the malice of aggression and bringing troops and weapons to destroy the failed Ukraine was despised by the world  Захоплюючись президентом і українською армією за його патріотизм і непохитність, Путін через злобу агресії та введення військ і зброї для знищення проваленої України був зневажений світом.  Zakhoplyuyuchysʹ prezydentom i ukrayinsʹkoyu armiyeyu za yoho patriotyzm i nepokhytnistʹ, Putin cherez zlobu ahresiyi ta vvedennya viysʹk i zbroyi dlya znyshchennya provalenoyi Ukrayiny buv znevazhenyy svitom.
That is my kind of cruise ship, i want a 2cnd class suit next to the Gatling AK 130 cannon with a view to the Bazalt missile launchers, with clean towels. But in the Varyag, the Moskva is too wet now , i've heard.
So, the 8===D finger thing from the island was not a joke. Now they must actualize the stamps with the boat sinking too.
Pretty soon Ukraine is just going to be a pile of rubble

“Special military operation” prank gone wrong
Sinkem all!!!!!  And take all the mohammidan ships (both of them) too
Old ship
Misinfo confused me for days. Your report seems close to reality. It's not hit by Ukrainian missiles.
Lmao garbage ship
Hello from Ukraine, lovely British people. I've been reading some russian news recently. Their comment sections are fun to read, russians are flabbergasted by this despite the state news working on downplaying the loss. Previously they said that even 20 Neptunes couldn't damage this ship. Then for two days their propaganda had been lying about the ship being just damaged by fire. Also, Moskva's crew is 500+, only ~50 are evacuated. But their propagands tells all of them are safe and sound. This is "1984" right in front of our eyes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvvAnBdmOFc
The comical contradiction, Ukraine claimed they hit the ship, Russia denies it, but then shells Kyiv as revenge. Revenge for what? If they didn’t hit it…we’ll done Ukraine
Why didn't they launch a few more neptunes and destory the entire black sea fleet of unwanted guests?
Hope for peace soon 🙏✌️💙☮️
Russia will never live that one down. So not only are their troops getting their arses kicked, losing valuable equipment each day, have companies denying them services they have now also lost a flagship they can't easily replace. They should drag Putin off his throne before he makes Russia a bigger joke than it already is.
How embarassing is this for russia?  ukraine doesnt even have a navy!!!! Russia is a total joke!!! slava ukraine 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
That will make the Ruskis stand off further from the coast. I'm sure they wouldn't any more 'fires' to occur on their ships.
But who's gonna clean up the oil in the sea
L putin
Kudos Ukraine!!!!
According to the Russian state media, it was not the Ukrainians who sink the MOSKVA but the the Russian admiral in charge of the fleet smoking in his bed that started the fire and ultimately sink the ship.
Good sink more
Glory  to Ukraina ‼️
Now let's see Russia leave the Black sea and Turkey keep the door shut.
Yes, I understand that moths are quite a problem these days especially at sea.
Of this great military loss and epic disaster so closely associated also to Sevastopol, Balaklava & Crimea … The great Alfred Lord Tennyson might have said…   Though not a sailor knew the #Moskva had blundered.  Into the sea of death sailed the 500.  Missiles to the right of them, Drones to the left. Theirs was not to reason why, Theirs was but to do and die,  into the sea of death sailed the 500.   #Moskva #Ukraine
All these people manufacturing indignation at a ship that was commissioned in 1983 being sunk by modern anti ship cruise missile, just remember the Serbs in the 1990’s shot down an at the time modern American stealth bomber F117 with a 1960’s model russian s125 Sam system….
Russians, as usual, lied that it was a fire on Moskva, nothing with Ukrainian missiles,  then they couldn't hide anymore after it sank. I've never seen any nation that lies all the time. "Lie" is the main and vital part of their daily lives, they usually believe  in what they lie for and expecting the rest of the world to believe them as well, from 7 years old to 77 years old, lie is in their blood.
The Russian Warship is doing a shortcut to the pacific ocean through the earth core. not sinking !

украина потопила твой линкор Teehee ur so witty and clever
Ukraine must most not say whether or not they sank the Russian ship Moscow. It must still be entirely up to the army. Glory. Ukrain 💙💛✨✨🇸🇪
Glory to Ukraine! The sinking is not just a key tactical victory, as others have rightly said, but a representation of what will happen to Putin's regime. 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
TRUTH FROM FRONT LINES IN UKRAINE CHANNEL YT ''PATRICK LANCASTER''  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2qiqpMN6dM
Why don’t we see that, in the face of a nuclear war, military might is insignificant?  Why do leaders of world’s great powers not see the truth of the false?
It didn't just sink, it was sunk by the Ukrainians. America confirmed 2 rocket strikes... Gulp gulp gulp...
the ciws of moskva is not working 😂😂😂
she said mokva lol
Ukrainian version of Pimp my ride: Putin brings in his rusty old missile cruiser, Zelensky turns it into a submarine! He also put a some sick-azz flame paintjob on it - and some extra windows.
I thought Russia had one of the toughest militaries around? They're getting their asses kicked! Putin's really embarrassed himself in his final years
A convoy of Ukrainian farmers in their tractors is en–route to the sinking location
The Moskva had taken part of a Special Military Operation which goal was a Tactical Fire and a Strategic Sinking. It performed so well, that it was afterwards promoted to submarine first class.
Stop war Russia
I think the Russian press is a fact of fire. It was A stupid Russian sailor smoked a cigarette while sleeping🚬👍
So where is it and how deep?
BIDEN STOP SEND WEAPONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! STOP THE WAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! STOP SEND WEAPONS TO UCRANIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PEACE!!!!!!!!
Haha, great work Ukraine, whoohoo!
More than 21,000 innocent people were bombed and killed in Mariupol alone, and this ship had to be party to that. Not quite an eye for an eye with only 500 sailors lost.
What did except the Ukrainian to do give the flagship moskva a coat of paint
It is a pity we couldn't see it Live. It would be hilarious.

Nobody should ask for or sell weapons because it is a pretext to prolong the war, the wars, it is the will of those who want to make an economic and political profit to the detriment of the world's populations.

Great news
Good job
Moskva S400 and S500 Transformed to a Special  Underwater Missile defense system
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻
Is Port Arthur for the Russian navy again
Putin:  The warship Moskva has not sunk it has simply been reclassified as a new type of submarine and is on a special underwater mission.
Doesn't mater what happened its gone get over it
Moscow city will sink soon too.....
Were there  nuclear weapons on board?
well done.  Moscow is playing out of their league.  Glug blub.
Ukrainians need to ask for a refund for these anti ship missiles. They are terrible.
results of aggression
Russia...It was a fire. Also Russia...We will seek revenge for the Moskva.
THE MOSKVA IZ A DUAL PURPOSE SHIP... GARBAGE SCOW AND BARRIER REEF...
Glug, glug, glug, glugski.💦

Hahahaha
Lol. 🤣
Russia: As planned.. Lol
There is something off about the tone of this report from Sky. They gave full credence to the report out of the Moscow agency, but 'almost' trivialized the report from Ukraine. It's a tonal, or wording issue, rather than a pure fact issue. Then again, historically, most people are aware of Skys political leanings.
Good News ))) Ukraine Will Win
"it's just a Special Bouyancy Operation" : Admiral Vlad
Missiles making large warships uneconomical. Don't think we will see many more being built they are out of date technology.  Showing vunrability since the Falklands.
Viva ukrain💙💛✌✌✌👍👍👍👍💚💛💜💖
🇷🇺 🖕 🛶 💥🔥👍
Let that SINK IN Putin
Everything is Fake In Russia And Usa,just for making scare to world 😄
Russia must have the most incompetent military and fleet in History. But then again, it's no wonder with an inept gasbag like Pootin as their master.
No other way that zelensky must stepdown...this is all happening merely 100% due to his stupidity.
All Russia has is nuclear weapons. They would lose a war with the Salvation Army.
Curious, in WW2, when Germany sunk the Hood, it fired up the British. When the British sunk the Bismark, it demoralized Germany. (According to my history/propaganda.) What direction will this take in Russia. Definitely Good on Ukraine. But is Russia a sleeping giant? Or a lying propaganda machine and their military is a joke.
good 👍
Stend up with Ukraine!!! Slava Ukraine
Great news .
I'm sure later this ship will be a tourist magnetic!!!  I wait on the first videos under water! (:
I've really heard no definitive cause for the sinking of this ship.  But with all else being equal, I'll believe the Ukrainian version over the lying, state-owned media of Putin.
**lololololololol = wowza!!!**
I don't believe anything from the media.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXUEJePZM5Q
Explosion in the ammunition hold which crippled the battship. When being toed back to port it sunk.
URAAAAAA URAAAAAA URAAAAAA
Battleship sunk 😆
oh wow
April 14th is #WorldQuantumDay.  Phew, what a day. USS The Sullivans sinking - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lE_O5GkVLBA
Any pics or video of it sinking?
HAHAHAHAHAH
Not wanting to be left out of the Incompetency Olympics, the Russia navy looks to unseat the Russian the Army and go for the Gold 😂
More Russian scrap. Ukraine should check the debris for nukes.  Game changer.
Oh eck
This looks like the only short lived victory for the Ukrain army. That is if they have anything to do with this.
The Moskva had 6 ak630 ciws, how could a missile hit the ship???
Maybe it's just an annual exercise, and this year it was a "how to sinks a warship" exercise and it worked. 😷😷😷
Well, Russians just increased their submarine count..🤪🤪🐒
It's Almighty GOD doing
Mock what ? 😏
Bye ship
the russian fleet has never been so depressed ...
This is a colossal humiliation for Russia. One of their largest, most expensive, most powerful military assets sunk by a handful of missiles. Close to a billion dollars on the bottom of the sea.
hahahah good
👏🇺🇦
конечно , старым говном воюют :)
I hope all Russia will go down!
Good.
And Ukraine HAS NO NAVY!!...  RUSSIAN NAVY SUCKS 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😁
it sunk due to the quantity of Vodka inside
Is a small loss to Russia, no Russian citizens were killed
If Putin claim the ship was damaged not by missiles but by a fire, then if they say they will attack Kiyv more as revenge then they're obviously lying as usual. Ukraine should threaten to attack if Russia don't leave
The evil that is represented by the US is clear, the ulcerated pustule of human industrial greed, we all know it, that regime/military complex is potentially the human self destruct mechanism to end all planet life for another few thousand years. And all for a made up dream.
Slava Ukraini 💙💛💪👊
I'm just supprised it wasn't towed away by a Ukrainian tug boat 😜
This video was posted exactly when the Titanic had its 110Th anniversary
Now it's going to be more destructive and never ending war will come out. Allah help us, bring peace here.
GOTCHA!
To quote a certain someone: "For war criminals, there is no purgatory. They go straight to hell."  Slava Ukraini.
Tomorow Lawrov will say, that Russia never had a vessel called 'Moskva'!
Warships and aircraft careers are increasingly becoming obsolete with new weapons technologies. This is not just a Russian military complication. Both Russian and U.S. militaries are becoming increasingly obsolete and irrelevant to modern technologies. It just so happens that Russians found themselves in a hole trying to project their 19th and 20th century imperial aspirations through obsolete military force. Similar to warships, aircraft careers are becoming obsolete as well. They are slow floating airports in the middle of ocean, waiting to be hit by missiles. Yet the U.S. has invested heavily on them. It will be a matter of time that one of these slow-moving floating airports gets hit by drones and missiles. How will U.S. react if any one of its obsolete careers get hit and sunk by a low-cost cruise missile? It will be unpredictable and heavily dependent on what character is in control at the White House at the time. As it stands right now, war criminals in U.S. Congress impose sanctions on war criminals in Russia. Same war criminals in the U.S. encourage war criminals in Saudi Arabia to increase their petroleum production to offset the oil production of Russian war criminals.
Strange that there are no images or videos available from the ship on fire or sinking?? It's a terrible war blamed to the Russians, The Eu and especially NATO.
haha good because putins soldiers can not look after there equipment
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If only had that moron Obama had taken Xi and Putin seriously and got funding for building hypersonic missile then I don’t think our enemies would dare to start a war with Ukraine.
https://youtu.be/G09uzs5B9hU
Lol Russian we sunk our own ship (according to the Russians as no enemy could damage it)! Lol your Navy is shxt, your Army is shxt, FFS don't press the nuke button they will probably blow up in their silo's! 🤣😂🤣😂
No the ''Black Sea Fleet Moskva'' is a submarine. It's not sunk, it is asleep, pining for the fjords. It's not sunk it loves kipping on it's back at the bottom of the sea.......Lovely plumage
I am sorry for almost any loss of human life. Anyway In your face Putin!
Ukraine have Halo 😇🙏 ruZZia only have the Hooylo, Bloody Vlad Hooylo.
All Russian warships have duo functionality, they can used as surface ship or submarine.  This time the captain of Moskva is carrying out an undersea operation to destroy NATO submarine in Black Sea, and is a mission accomplished . 🤗🤗
Yay,. Ukraine is winning the war😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂
surely they got more than 1 ship of this kind??
HA, HA.  Ukraine a country with no navy sinks a russian ship !  Ammo and fire excuse is BS
let's drink to that! 🍻
Russia take Mariopol and win this war. Africa is with.
Hopefully all the crew have gone down on it.
Way to go ukraine.Keep on them.Glory to Ukraine 🇺🇦
Hell yeah
🤣😂🤣😂
The Moscow missile cruiser, the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, was destroyed by a Ukrainian-made Neptun cruise missile. R-360 "Neptun" is a Ukrainian anti-ship cruise missile. Developed at the Kyiv design bureau Luch in 2014-2020. In 2020, the coastal complex RK-360MTs "Neptun" on the basis of a missile was adopted by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUcaF1EPOA
Russia is attacking Kyiv in retaliation for "an ammunition explosion"🤔🇺🇦
Lets see the pictures of it sunk.just heard the towing it part, still sketchy that russia would want the world to know.
Putin must be sick of his military. 😂🤣🇬🇧🇬🇧
Russia ship sinks along with the west economy victory
Now sink Putin
i bet that WENT DOWN WELL in the Kremlin
Glory to Ukraine. Russia deserves this in order to know that war is aweful
After 19 years since the beginning of the invasion of Iraq, has the West forgotten this war? The Iraq war is said to have resulted in 1 million deaths the difference  is russia have weapons of mass destruction  A message to the future generations never make russia feel threatened the difference between "looking dangerous" and "being dangerous".Russia  describes military doctrine as defensive military doctrine. With regard  to nuclear weapons specifically, Russia reserves the right to use  nuclear weapons: in response to the use of nuclear and other types of  weapons of mass destruction against it or its allies,in case of  aggression against Russia with the use of conventional weapons when the  very existence of the state is threatened
😆😆😆 the Russians aren’t very good are they!
Putin personally awards crew of Moskva with Order of Courage for destroying two Ukrainian missiles.
Yeaahh !!  Indeed a great and happy news. To as many as possible !!
Just amazing
Take a look at the history of this ship... pretty intresting
Yes !!
The Irony that this ship was built in Ukraine and sunk in Ukrainian water  Lol
Ha Ha!
0:05 Mockva indeed
Definitely something a cause for laughs, and something to be merry about. I don't doubt a lot of people see this as marvelously delightful news. Except that Vladimir Putin has been causing the defense forces of the Russian Federation to be diminished, for no good reason at all. And what is going to happen, if they are really needed? They have been squandered because of Vladimir Putin's megalomania and insane aims.
What?.. no Leonardo de caprio or Kate Winslet singing my heart will Go on from the bow of the ship?
Big targets easy to hit with today's missiles.
Glory to Ukraine! 🇺🇦
Victory to Ukraine ❤❤❤
It is America that hit the ship. We are expecting big Revenge on America from Russia
the ship is so old.. this is the time to end service..
- - - > Did the ship have any tactical nukes onboard?  < - - -
😂😂😂😂
It's all part of the special underwater operations mission. Putin is trying to invade, I mean liberate BikiniBottom. 🍍
Russian Version - Whilst on patrol, the ship successfully captured 2 Ukrainian missiles and then the crew celebrated with a barbecue. The crew then extinguished the barbecue by directing the ship to camouflage itself beneath the waves.  Ukrainian version - Two Ukrainian missiles sank the ship - Slava Ukraini.
who would win: The flag ship of the great Russian Black Sea Fleet VS some cheap outdated knockoff bootleg tomahawk that might not work sometimes.
Slava Ukraini!
Where are the photos?
It's all well saying it's sunk but we need proper proof. Propaganda is a mugs game.
Going, going, gone!! https://youtu.be/G09uzs5B9hU
Anyone falling for THIS being a flagship, are falling for all the other propaganda.  REALLY?!
A lot of people are ignoring the Russian claim it was a possible Ukranian mine. Russia claimed Ukrain set out 100 rouge un-anchored mines into the black sea. Then quickly changed it to 10.   Ukraine said they were Mines taken from storage in their Crimean port annexed by Russia and set near odesa, by Russia. Ukrain said there are a little over 100 and a recent storm knocked about 10 loose.   Turkey chimed in and claimed they believe it was possible Ukranian mines, set by Russia, were let loose by a storm, one of the rouge mines hitting the destroyer.
Glug Glug Glug.....
Ukraine literally cut off the head of the Russian black sea fleet... most impressive!!!
Such a shame.
Russia rather claim to be incompetent than say their flagship was destroyed by Ukraine - lol
Even if it's a huge propaganda win for the Ukranian I fear that the loss will wake the Russian army. It's a relatable loss to them and perhaps they actually see a reason to fight. A great deal of they lack of success is because the soldiers hasn't seen the point with the invasion (ups, not what they call it). The Ukranian should have kept quiet and let the Russian send out a story we all knew wasn't realistic and whisper out the (I hope) real one among their people.
Goed gedaan 💙💛
The world is against this war.   Invasions are a thing of the past and everyone should know this.
Oh dear, How sad, Never mind.
Lol the Russian war ship finally took the first Ukrainians killed advice by going and fcking itself ao
Moskva kaput. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Russian warship go glug glug glug.
Sunkinov
All the protests in Russia are fake. I'm being doing my due diligence, they are all staged. They think that will keep people from bombing russian soil. Well we can go ahead now and do that..RUSSIAN PROTEST ARE FAKED FOR PROPAGANDA
It's enough now Russia should use nuclear weapon against Ukraine.
We all Indian🇮🇳 fully support Russia.
c ya
Russia long live
Bravo 👏
I have a sneaky feeling it was neither a fire or Ukrainian strike. It's not like NATO will announce what it is up to.
Tsk tsk tsk. Proves God is on Ukraine's side. Hope asshole Rasputin heeds this signal, surrenders to his peers and accepts a revolver and bullet and says DOSVIDANYA! Another equally significant point is that Rasputin has proved that Russia's image as a superpower in E Europe is a complete FAKE AND BS Do people know that tugs ALWAYS shadow another flagship, carrier Admiral Kuznetsov? Afraid this rusted set of steel plates and bolts may turn turtle?  :)
The original Moskva (Russian: Москва́) was one of six Leningrad-class destroyer leaders built for the Soviet Navy during the 1930s. It was completed in 1938 and assigned to the Black Sea Fleet.  She participated in the Raid on Constanța.  On 26 June 1941, a few days after the beginning of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, she struck a mine and was sunk. The guided missile cruiser Moskva was launched as the Slava on 1979.  She was re-fitted and re-commissioned as the Moskov in 2000.  The two "Moskov's" are now less than 100 miles apart, on the seabed of the Black Sea.
Putin loose lip sink the ship
Vladimir Putin must be arrested, tried and HANGED as the War Criminal he is. And the Execution should be seen all over the World just to show that now in the 21st Century NO ONE is beyond the reach of JUSTICE  !
VIDEO HAS LITTLE TO NO CREDIBILITY
BULLSHIT STORY
Great news 💞 💞 💞 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 💯 💯 💯 💪 💪 💪
Hahaha -- what's worse: the Ukrainians sunk it by missiles, or the Russians sunk it by burning toast? Both are totally humiliating  for the Gremlins in the Kremlin. 🇬🇧 🇺🇦
America should expel Russia from the UN Security Council and strip it of its veto power. This would be a fatal blow to Russia because there are many countries that fear a Russian veto. As for Russian oil and gas, it must be replaced by American and Qatari gas and oil via ships, and the Nigerian through the Nigerian pipeline passing through    to  sinigal to moritania to Morocco to Europe. This line must be accelerated. He likes to supply Ukraine with a thousand US and Turkish drones, and Russia should be denied a Russian veto
Nice shot.
Why aren’t most these anchors pronouncing the name like they do the city? It’s Moscow!

Good job Ukrain,  now sink all the Russian ships  in the Black Sea Area, God Bless Ukrainians and Glory to Ukrain
Why is Russia even trying to debate how the ship sank. Either Ukraine hit it with missiles and sank it which is an embarrassing lose. Or ammunition caught fire and it sank which just reinforces how embarrassingly incompetent the Russia military is. Either way Russia doesn't come out looking very good.
Does any one know if the Captain has had his special never to be seen again promotion yet, asking for a friend.
Russia ship go fish yourself.... under the sea.... lol
Good for Russia it's about time something good has happened
Mówcow pfuuuu!!!!!!!!!! Putin💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀 Russia country 🐷💣🐷🐷💣🐷💣💣🐷🐷💣🐷
Sink more Ukraine sink more
God, I've never seen such a strong military be so completely incompetent. I feel like all the corruption in Russia is finally starting to show with all of these logistical and military blunders.
Russia can say all the bullshit lies they want I don't believe a word they say
Yay Ukraine
I hope Ukraine military sinks more that motherfuker ships
The ukranian navy has glass bottomed boats so they always looks and see where the russian ship are
According to the Kremlin, the ship was not sunk, it is only in a "special underwater reconnaissance operation".😌
HAHAHAHA 😂😂😂🏴‍☠🤘Slava Ukraine!
Well done Ukraine!! 🇨🇦🤝🇺🇦
That thing had like 60 S-300 missiles. That single ship locked down the entire south of Ukraine  air space.  News people never mention that and just Flag ship this and that. No that is a floating Anti air and Rocket battery that blocked ATLEAST 75 miles inland from the coast  free air movement .
Since the end of the Cold War, NATO has become increasingly involved in peacekeeping and peace-support operations, deploying in support of the wider interests of the international community and working closely together with other organisations to help resolve deep-rooted problems, alleviate suf- fering! But Putin has created the opposite.
Отрицательно всплыл 😁
It went in a special operation to inspect the bottom of the sea :)))
Thank God.
Keep it up Russia 💪❤️
What a shame it didn't sync with all hands on Deck British SAS now training Ukrainian special undersea warfare Commandos prepare for a few more these tin cans to go straight down Olympic mine's are a wonderful thing
Zz
G’wan Ukraine!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦👍
It was Karma, my friend.
This is what we call a special operation 😀. Welcome Sweden and Finland 🙌
Well to be honest I don't think ukraine sunk it and I don't beleave Russia say it was ammo explosion. I beleave it was a como of the both. Becouse it isent easy to sink a ship. So my guesses is that ukraine fired it missiles and hit the ammodepo and that made the ship sink. Lucky shot from ukraine. Simple as that. Its impossible to sink a ship that way.
Russian equivalent of HMS Hood.
whats more out of 510 crew only 50 survived, more and more good news
Ukraine has NO missiles. Other countries do. The  War is a false paradigm
Good job 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦 keep them coming Ukraine
The Moscow is a dual purpose ship, for some mission it's a surface war ship and for other missions it serves as a submarine and it is now on special submarine operations.  Congratulations to the Ukraine Military.
The Moskva did not sink it's performing a special 'submarine refit operation on the bottom of the Black Sea'
wouldn't it been cheaper to have a special operation breaking up ya scrap metal n selling it to china?...probably would of made a few quid by now all that metal keep chucking away
The Russian people paid for advanced weapons and ended up with fireworks. Putin the wealthiest man on the planet
it just became a biggest russian submarine - thats it! Slava Ukraina!
The ‘cruise ship’ what horrid reporting
Lol  Russian junk ship is now gone. Russia is a joke. Lol. Lol China is also. Go Ukraine show the world real men and advanced weapons
слава украини Slava Ukraini Glory for Ukraine  слава украини Slava Ukraini Glory for Ukraine  слава украини Slava Ukraini Glory for Ukraine
The commanding officer of Moskva, Anton Kuprin, has apparently died in the explosion. Some reports claim that so did almost 90% of the crew.
More easily visible propaganda sky , it didn't sink, they're moved it to repair it, such devious liars!
🇧🇧🇺🇦
Tipical russian junk armament , hehehehe.
Fantastic , great shot, cheers .
All Western media reporting fake news very shame
Russia using well tried German avoidance tactic,    Scuttling.
"this ship wasn't sunk by or enemies, we deny this wholly. Our sheer incompetence sank this ship'
missile "cruise" ship?!?!     "Cruiser"
That’s Great!!!!

Are there any images of the vessel sinking?
Did it have nuclear warheads on board when it sunk?
Please please just get rid of Putin and his evil pal Trump
🥳🎉
The Ukraine Pesident just sent this message to Putin after sinking the russian flag ship https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LM0CZZ9Uw8&t=41s
Moskva Sinks~
Hahahahahahahaha, thanks for brightening up my Friday and making it a truly Good Friday 🤣
NATO Signals Intelligence, ELINT and ECM, NATO targeting Coordinates, NATO technical setup and equipment, NATO Anti-ship missiles? Ukraine pushing the launch button.  We are heading for WW3.
Fake news. The cruiser "did not lose buoyancy." It is safely in Port. No sinking.
It s time russia to more bombardement capital city kyiv dont waste time as soon as,god save russia🇷🇺
Russia: This is a declaration of war.. oh wait
Now hot Moscow.
Glory to Ukraine !
LOL 🤣😂 SO FUNNY WELL DONE UKRAINE
The Moskva is one of 3 large capital battle cruisers ,losing one is like America losing an Aircraft Carrier in terms of prestige, was a disgruntled Russian sailor drinking too much🍸Vodka and set fire to it?
Stormy weather ?  God's sign 🙏
Brilliant move !
The ship is seriously damaged and is tied up at Port that is not a sunk ship... This is fake news the ship is not sunk
Moskva was badly damaged after it was hit by 2 Ukranian neptune cruise missiles.
This war has exposed Russia's military as an absolute mess !
YES! One Ork flagship sunk with most of it's crew.  The world is a fractionally less evil place this morning.
HA-HA!
Russia fleet victourious again! They gained biggest submarine ever . It is on a special underwater mission to denazify sea fauna

Ukraine special operation into Moskva against PutinHitler2
"Russian warship go F*&^ yourself!" And the Russians obeyed.
🤣🤣 Russian incompetence my arse... well done Ukraine 🇺🇦 .. fk u putin ‼️
Sky news is very sad.😉
Moskva pls go on submarine operation!
This is so stupid lmao. If it was shot by a missile, there would have been casualties. It is not logical to assume that a ship has been hit by missiles, yet every single human stayed alive, therefore it couldn't have been hit. Secondly, the ship has been in service for 40 years, meaning that accident can happen much more frequently. The loss of this ship is not as great as people think. Russia has been building its replacement even before this happened, it was gonna be replaced anyway. This is not tragic by any means.
Believing Russia is like believing Johnson
The kremlin was directly hit..a big humiliation for Vlad
There was a Ukrainian spy on the ship and he blew himself up
So much embarrassment for Russia, regardless if it was Ukraine or not it just shows the incompetence of the Russian military and their equipment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eP9ypJycLs    we are living in a russian submarine
The boys on snake island were right they fucked themselves.
We need independent confirmation, official Russian news can't be trusted.
Good. Goooooooooood. Off to the next target. Slava Ikraine
Let is chant NAM MYO HO REN GE KYO this is only way to be happy convert to nichiren shoshu NAM MYO HO REN GE KYO
Now it’s a submarine
Putin didn't think this through, he's getting his azz kicked, rightfully so.
From whats been written about this ships weaponry,I thought it would've required a carrier fleet to take it down.Turns out it was a piece of junk.
Knowing Russia very well I can give 2 possibilities: A. Ukraine did. B: which is more probable. Russia is an utterly corrupt state and Russian military is not an exemption. What happened with the Russians only carrier is an example of corruption. Basically the they could blowup it to coverup Nothing has been repaired.
This was just a strategic sinking operation.
Down goes the devil ... so .. GypsyTrail
NEW HOME FOR FISH !!!!
GOOD
Good
YEA!!!!! THAT'S FOR THE ANTONOV!!!! IT HAS BEN AVENGED!!!
Russian: H  9 : Water!!  Ucranian  D 5 :  Sunk!!
Call the fire department ha ha  .
Fascism should not exist (anywhere) Ukraine was wrong  I love Russia 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
No more attacks against Ukraines citizens  from that ship. 👍👍👍
was it sinking at all?
Great news. Whatever the true cause, its another straw added to the camel's back.
https://youtu.be/zzsf8O5e1Rk
Nice music in support of Ukraine: https://youtu.be/55qJPJGjiCk
New Hi tec army will wipe out any old army, new tactic is 1000`s of small drones working in teams and strong air defence with many locations, than some fast btr`s to captue what is left over after drone strikes, also ships are old solution good rockets will take them all down like that moscov criuiser, cost of it, and amoint of sailors lol, just a few rockets was enough to destroy, no comments, if Ukraine will get more hi tec equipment and still use smart tactic russian have no chance, and alot of russian will die for what? for Z? hmmm
"It is the flagship of the Black Sea fleet". Correction - It WAS the flagship of the Black Sea fleet.
Russians are bad warriors, if it wasn't for the WEST and USA...Hitler would have taken RUSSIA EASY!
The goal was already met by Russia. Why don’t Sky News report both sides of the story.
Well, there must be some fun for Western Fascists, right ?!
The heads of Russian military fanboys must be exploding right now just like the Moskva. 😆
Yippee-kay-ay Ukraine!
Slava Ukraini.
That soldier really did mean it when he said go f#$k yourself.
It’s a shame Putin isn’t on that ship so he could go down with it.
Lol Russia has got big problems 🤣
YES PERFECT
Certainly Ukraine had nothing to do with it; it was a foreign, sorry strange fire dancing on Russian ship and the amunitions joined the dance.
Awful news..😄😄😄😄😄
It has not sunk, it is a "special underwater operation"
show us the proof .in the 1980s little argentina sunk a british warship in the falklands war the proof was all over the worlds media.NOW SHOW US THE PROOF.HAHAHAHA
It was destroyed by the Ukrainian  anti-ship missile "Neptune" 🚀 Glory to Ukraine 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Reports say that it still had nuclear missiles on board as it went down.
lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
With all hands, hopefully
slava Ukraini
Bravo Ukraine! The 'Moscow' was well within range of Ukrainian anti-ship missiles. It was the flagship of the Black Sea fleet, one of three main missile battlecruisers of the Russian Navy. A strategic loss to the Russians and a major morale defeat to them. Russians will, of course, deny it being hit by Ukrainian missiles due to loss of face.
Ha ha
Currently undergoing "Special Underwater Operations" against the Swiss Navy.
It was USA & NATO which provoked Russia But it is Ukraine which is paying the price
Where is NATO, U.S army, missiles, nuklear weapons, foab moab? All of Ukraine has destr0yed, Ukrainians r migrating. While the media is saying that Russians r scared, they retreated. Which is a lie
Looks like the Russian Warship has fucked off.
So either Russian incompetence allowed a fire completely destroy a ship. Or, Russian incompetence allowed a fleet flagship be sank by missiles.
Russia is the most Badest Army the World ever had seen ! hahaha, first everyone thought they are invincible, but not even Ukraine they can Fight hahahaha, what a shame, such a looser country, and everyone who supports them are even more bigger losers !
Ukranians sinked Moskva, but Russians can nuke Kiev.
Interestingly, the god Neptune has a trident in his hands, the Ukrainian national emblem is very similar, so I'm wondering if this is God's punishment or just a coincidence? Zanimljivo da Bog Neptun ima trozubac u rukama, Ukrainski nacionalni amblem je jako sličan pa razmišljam da li je ovo božja kazna ili samo slučajnost?
It is a special operation under water.
I think that it is a cruiser and not, as described, a cruise ship!!
The Russian navy is pulled back behind the Crimean peninsula to keep them safe. This confirms that the Ukrainian army hit it with their Neptune ASM and Russian incompetence made sure it sank.
Wow they way this has been reported comes across as the news of the century. Such a dangerous famous ship but the other news is zelenskey needs $7 billion a month to pay wages makes the sinking of this ship sound like a drop in the ocean.
Its also 110 years ago today that the Titanic sank. In terms of important ships that have sunk, I'd rather focus on that one! Power to Ukraine!
These are signs God is showing to Putins that he can not win the wars,God speak through signs
335
Good job Ukraine.... God bless Ukraine.. From Philippines
This is a catastrophe for the Russian Navy. And thus this situation is very dangerous. This can lead to serious escalation of the war, potentially nuclear.
I'm not interested in the TOYS of Rich ppl.  Or their War Games.
So who is cleaning up the fuel that would obviously be leaking from this sinking ship????? Where are all the woke environmental protection ppl at?  They should be screaming about the Pollution of War if they are so virtuous and committed to their cause.
So either Russia sunk their own ship through sheer incompetence or Ukraine sunk it. Which is it? :D
I'll bet the Russians will say the Moskva didn’t sink, it just submerged to put out the fire. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Another lie. The ship was damaged, but sailed on its own to a Russian port in the southeast of the Black Sea. Kolejne kłamstwo. Okręt został uszkodzony, ale dopłynął o własnych siłach do rosyjskiego portu na południowym wschodzie Morza Czarnego.
Russia is goin to give Ukrainian capital hell and turn to another Mariupol. One flagship ship destroyed the worth of that ship with all its cargo must be in billions. One city for one ship. I think we can call it even. Agree?
Now the Russian navy cruiser Moskva is the most powerful warship on the sea floor.
Ukraine's missles multi ship
Parem de falar de russos Isso é o que eles querem
why do these media report lies and tell them over and over again? This flagship has sailed away from the black sea and has not sunk into the sea, so we have just been told.  Why glorify an event that has no consequence to the actual direction of this conflict?
Will Turkey and Greece now close the Bosporus Straits to further Russian naval movements?
Good, glug glug 🤣
Z-Rusos Z-nazis 🐷🤮🤮 criminales
ADOLF PUTIN 🤮🤮💩💣
🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦💪
What a wonderful strike 😎
Embarrassing for Putin. Dangerous reactions are coming.
The world's 2nd most powerful military's sinking reputation 😏
We don't believe a word of it Russia.  Putin desperate not to lose face.  Russian rule no.1......deny everything
STOPP WAR 🙏🙏🙏
🤣
Good job ukraine.
B2 x    B3 x   B4 x    B5 x     B6 x     "Sunk!"
"Ariel, listen to me The human world, it's a mess Life under the sea Is better than anything they got up there"
People are always sad to see a ship sinking. No one I know has expressed any joy about it.
False flag of a post - There’s no video of the sinking.
GERASIMOV AND SHOIGU SHOULD STEP UP THIS SPECIAL OPERATIONS AGAINST WESTERN CR1MINALS.
Brilliant. ...too bad it wasn't full of Russians at the time🙊🙉🙈
If this is the same ship that bombarded Ukrainian cities, then what a shame the Russian sailors were rescued.
Let me get this right. Russia claims it was a fire and not a missile from Ukraine that caused the sinking. Then why are the Russians saying they are going to take revenge for it by firing missiles at Kyiv.?  Russians forgetting their own lies.
Appreciations to Ukraine solidiers
It has merely been repurposed as a submarine. Not sunk! Fake news.
Ha, brilliant.
40 yrs old isn't that old for a ship..Even the Russian navy is run by incompetent personnel..Russia went from a super power in he old days to a 3rd world country run by a bunch of idiots and morons
Great News. 👏👏👏
Special sinking operation, please stand correct.
Very good!
the cruiser "Moscow" was successfully upgraded to the submarine "Wocsom" after unscheduled negative surfacing
Haha
Ship sank as a result of a fire? Is the hull made of wood?
1:09 A guided missile cruiser with 12500 tons replacement was a "symbolic presence"?
Fun fact : it sunk same date as Titanic 🤫😌
Multi purpose vehicle. A ship that turns into a submarine.😂😂🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Fantastic strike
The weather service should be able to tell us: Has there been a storm over the Black Sea?
Well done Ukraine keep up the good work. $750 million according to news week is not chicken feed. Plus one more floating missile launcher out of the way.😀. One way or the other it is great. It it either a victory to Ukraine or else it is russias complete and utter stupidity having a fire in a ammo room on a war ship. What someone went for a quiet cigarette????????😂🤣😀😁
It’s now the flag ship of the ocean floor
He's (Putin) really out there actually managing to make the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan seem like a campaign of military genius by comparison
The Russian news agency said this was not a missile strike its a special underwater operation.
If the news has came from Russia then it’s probably BS
Just for information this ship was build in Ukraine during soviet times
May all the Russian fleet follow.🇺🇦
does it really matter what sunk it? either way, it's a blow to the Russians and a huge embarrassment at that.
Regardless of how she was sank, it is a great embarrassment to Poo-tin and the Russian navy!
2014 coup and half of Ukraine contested the Government take over by American government push, but the Minks agreements were signed in 2014-15 to protect the breakaway provinces against any military action from the Ukrainian army!  They broke that treaty just after 8 years of aattacks against them.  14 thousand killed so far and Russia had enough of NATO's expansion that threatens Russia's security. America wants to control the wealth and resources just like any other coup attempts in the past around the world, Iraq, Afghanistan, Africa, Tywon, south China sea, and interventions in south America for the same reasons, etc The list goes on since after ww2. America is losing control after weaponizing the dollar to hurt other countries who don't lick the imperial boots of Washington DC. in retrospect, the dollor is being dropped by small and big countries all around the world and American purchasing power for foreign goods in dwindling little by little as they only can affect 26% of Russia's economy. Russia only trades with that percentage and will not hurt them in the long run. =====
i thought we dont listen to russian media. so are they lying about it sinking?
It is hilarious that Putin thinks he is saving face by stating his ship sank due to an onboard fire. He is basically claiming his sailors are not trained in proper damage control. For a guy who wants to have a military feared around the world, his sailors cannot put out a simple fire.   It would be a better look for him if he would admit his ship took a missile hit and sank instead of broadcasting on an international stage that his crew is incompetent.
On this day Titanic sank 110 years ago
where is the proof that it did sink? everything now on news they never show a real footage about what are they talking
What a shame
👏👏👏👏👏fock Rússia,desde to all
Sinking their aircraft carrier would be great :D
Brill
A justifiable sinking, this damned ship killed hundreds of Ukraine citizens in the East as it bombarded the local towns and Mariupole recently, death ship.
Senseless war. Putin to be arrested
So if it is sinking like they say, then why are all the pictures of the ship in tact? And surely Russia could just say it sunk so that people aren't looking for it? Just a thought
This made my day!!! It was the military equivalent of Will Smith's slap of Chris Rock. Listen up Pooptin - Keep the name "Ukraine" out of your f*cking mouth!!!
Bismarck is sunk again... HITLER... Putin... Russian Bismarck.. German Bismarck... One has to be an idiot not to see the similarities... Unbelievable...
what a shame !!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
show a picture of it on the seafloor, don't say it's 'sunk' if it hasn't.  please report real things, not just propaganda.
Putin: It didn’t sink it just became a submarine :)
They were cleaning the guns when one went off.
Russia welcome to Ukraine
Funny how no one has footage of it sinking
Did someone already told Putin?
Great news
Too bad. That's what happens in war
Special sink operation went according to plan apparently. Well done.
Ah such a sad day for Vlad the Darf, One of his ships, turned into an inpromtue submarine. He will tell us soon it is not a disaster but a new special operation, just wait and see.
this when true gets only one thing of mine: hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahbahahahahahahahahaha
Wonder what Taiwan makes of the sinking.
A Piece of Russian history sunk... The rest on it way, down.
Now sink Russia
Probably overloaded with vodka.
Hearing English speaking people try to pronounce "Moskva" brings almost as big a smile to my face as the news of it sinking. 😂
Russian news will simply report that their flagship has been reassigned to sub-aquatic duties, collecting barnacles for scientific research, it being an integral part of their special operations master plan.
thats awesome news. well done Ukraine
Lolz
Perfect news… russians new submarine newer float again 😁👍💪🇺🇦
Russians just don’t seem smart.  Just the design of this ship is ridiculous.  This thing is a floating powder keg.  Looks like it wouldn’t take much more than a spark from a cigarette to ignite all the ammo and sink this ship.
It hasn’t sunk 🤦‍♂️ It’s on a special underwater operation!
Oh dear what a shame
Russia has a terrible army nave and airforce China will want nothing to do with them all russia will have left are the chechens and ukraine will probably take the donbass and crimea back
There she goes into the line of symbolic warship losses: Arizona, Bismarck, Yamato, Hood, Prince of Wales, Sheffield 1982, Belgrano 1982, Kursk...
More pollution in our oceans.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
A new Russian submarine 👊
🤪🤪….Putin becoming more desperate.
Russia claims it was an internal accident.  Coincidentally, they are moving their ships further out from the coast.  2 & 2 doesn't ad up to the Russian story.  WTG Ukraine!  Слава Україні
What are your thinking about ?
Good.
I love this
Real crimes were committed in the US-funded biolaboratories in Ukraine. In the period from 2019 to 2021, American scientists from a laboratory in the city of Merefa (Kharkiv region) tested potentially dangerous biological drugs on patients at the Regional Clinical Psychiatric Hospital No. 3 in Kharkov. Individuals with mental disorders were selected for experiments based on their age, nationality and immune status.
Great news well done Ukraine
Just so sad it didn't happen to be any tractor nearby... 😉
Very good Ukraine, hit the invaders hard from all directions, show them no mercy.
Ukraine wins.
Gunshot victim did not die of the bullet, he died from the sudden loss of blood and blood pressure!
👏👏👏👏👏
Good!
The Russians have all this military equipment that they can’t maintain that constantly breaking down. Tanks falling apart. Their APC’s seems to be the best of their fighting equipment and some on their Truck. I could be wrong and Putin’s trying to keep what he has quite along with his best trained troops. But remember Saddam did the same thing and got his azz handed to him by the US and their allies in a matter of hours once the ground war started.
Did Putin subcontract Russian propoganda to North Korea? Only the utterly brainless will believe a thing the Russians say now.
Why is the Pentagon saying pretty much exactly what the Russians are saying then?
Russia: AdMiN uKrAiNe UsEd HaX
It’s amazing what a small bug like incendiary little drone can do today.  War is hell on Earth and war and it’s need to destroy has always has been the single most impetus for invention.
If it was only a fire they would not haved let it sink but with fear of more anti-ships missiles they would not be able for fixing or working on it so they had to leted it sink.
How many Ukrainian tractors does it take to tow a Commie battleship?  None because it sunk!  ☠️🇷🇺⚓️🇷🇺☠️     Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦 💙💛🇺🇦
That's a shame... :-)
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Neptune, the god of the seas, always was dangerous...
russia will make a moskva mark II like in the photogrpahy ? i doubt it they cant afford it now... putin regime will collapse soon anyway.. congrats for ukrainian soldiers !!
It hasnt sunk that rubbish its being towed back
Mr putun won't be happy
No comrade, we didn't just lose our flagship, it was just undertaking a "Special Underwater Operation". 😅😊
Have a listen to what Ukrainian civilians feom Mariupol say: https://youtu.be/-2qiqpMN6dM
Oh good to hear!!
Sank by Russia missiles make in Ukraine as where many military parts not replacements
News from Russia:  “It was not attacked. We just transformed it to be a submarine”
Why would Russia tell the world how to destroy their warships? Something about this whole thing is off.
Staormt weather on a SEA
MOSCOW sank, flag ship
The US is up to no good supplying Ukraine neptune missile in 2021 makes Russia view Ukraine as a threat to Russia's security. This is prove the Russian military operation in Ukraine is necessary.
Russian propaganda: crusise ship didnt sink, its now serving as a submarine. Everything is going according to plan.
We love cruising.
Putin’s spin about this: “After the Moskva came in contact with two Neptun Ukrainian missles, the missles blew up. The Moskva is now redeployed on a special underwater operation aimed at denazifying the bottom of the Black Sea”
Such a waste of time, energy, money, and resources.
what r we waiting for destroying all russian navy ?
Good.
Fun fact:  NATO code for project 1164 Atlant cruisers is Slava class.  So: Slava! Moskva is destroyed!
Has it really sunk tho lol sounds like bullshit too me
Haha what a bucket , Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦
💙💙💙💙💛💛💛💛🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Might make for a nice Divers tourist attraction once the Russians are kicked out ....  Hopefully not to Deep ...  Great Nursery for Fish ... LOL
CGTN reported it sunk. Agreed. It sunk.
It was sunk by two missiles fired by Ukraine.  I can officially confirm.
Sunk by a country with no navy…
This war is Soo boring 😴 and So disappointing 😞
Ukraine must now brace for mayhem... 😃
Ding dong the witch is dead
Has not sunk! It is carrying special underwater operation
Moskva is soo old .....Its just the same if the UK updated HMS Belfast and then returned her to active duty .....
Congratulations Ukraine ... Nice Hit !!!
Oh God !  This is going to get ugly big time. I know for a fact that some key points in western diplomacy are in a total panic because who knows the Russians well, is very aware of what is about to happen as a response.
Hope IT WILL NOT ESCALATE IN TO THE BLACK SEA!
This is sad. Hope the crew got away safely!
It was the lost souls of the fallen in Butcha and Krematosk, who had sunk this ship to the ground of Black sea. May God bless them to find salvation.
Putin sez it,s a. Submarine now!!!!😆
Hurrah! ☺️
SLAVA UKRAINE!
Russian ship Captain : Igor, stop BBQ in the missiles room !! Booommmm ~
As they say: bottoms up!
Great news.
just like the rest (or should that be rust?) of the Russian military, it's great. ......Until someone fights back.
This ship was actually built in Mykolyiv in Ukraine during Soviet times, 1 of only 3 that actually went into service, hope there is some footage somewhere of it going under.
Bravo Ukraine. Now THAT'S a strong statement to make to the incompetent Russians!!
Don't see why we have helicopters tanks and ships if they can be knocked our with missiles, watching the Ukraine conflict I think the Human race is at risk by our own technology, drones!!
Good
Has anybody actually seen it sinking? Like is there actually any footage?
We'll find the Russian battleship that's makin' such a fuss We gotta sink the Moskva cause the world depends on us Hit the decks a-runnin' boys and spin those guns around When we find the Moskva we gotta cut her down
Oops
With today's rockets all ships as well as tanks are clay pigeons. The armies just don't want to admit it, but that's the way it is.
This is absolutely brilliant news!!!!!
no setelite image that confrim that ship is sinking..... or american setelite are broken
Breaking news: Moskova has now been promoted to submarine
cool nice shot!!
Nice go to heel PUTIN
wahoo!
The Commander of the Moscow, word of mouth says was Cap n Crunch, He will never get promoted to Admiral now
I wonder which poor sod got the job of breaking the news to Vlad?
Good.
Excellent news, what a pathetic armed forces Russia has, only good for committing war crimes against innocent civilians!
Looks like Putin has stolen so much from Russia that there hasn't been much money left invested in their military.
Just heard Russians are retaliating for what they said was an accident on their black sea flagship. WHY? if it was an accident then the ones to blame are the captain and crew not Ukraine unless Ukraine really did sink it
How can russia even fight the u.s?
Naval flagship sunk by a country that don't even have naval presence, what a joke
Oooooh poor Putin 😅
Won't make one bit of difference to outcome of war. Ukraine can make all the claims they want, no proof to back it up.
BAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!! 🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂
still no evidence then, just talk so far.
Who lives in a pineapple under the?...sea Moskva Russian Warship
Most of Ukraines major cities and vital infrastructure have been turned to rubble, thousands dead, over 1000 soldiers surrendered and Russia lost a 40 year old ship with no casualties. People in the comments are delusional to believe this is a win for Ukraine.
Did they have insurance ?
Guided missile cruiser, not missile cruise ship. Missile cruise ship would be Wonder of The Seas fitted with tomahawks and harpoons 😅
missiles attacks and weapons to kill putin. the devil must die!
russian media: our warships is now advancing to the rear to resupply at our naval bases, becoming the first of its kind to conduct a special underwater operation
Lmao, how inept are the Russians at warfare.
Time to bring nukes into the game ☝️
Gotcha.
😆😆😆🇺🇦😆😆😆🇺🇦😆😆😆🇺🇦😆😆
This is yet another example of Russian arrogance and stupidity: apparently its movement was so regular the Ukrainians knew exactly where it would be and when......
Most likely a drunk sailor smoking caused this
A believable lie is indeed a smart move if we can benefit from it, but it's better to stay quiet than to lie which is so obvious like the Russian at the moment who is making a fool of themself and the entire world is laughing at their outrageous excuses.
The ship did not sink... Lies as usual no missile hit the ship
Hopefully Moscow will follow!
Wondering which General / Admiral got the fun job of going to the Bunker Tsar and telling about the Cruiser Mocba.
Haha Sky news is going to sink.
🤣
Thats got to be a dodgy insurance job😭😭😭
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.......Commie hunting time!
Yes, ammunition went on fire after it was hit with two anti-ship missiles.
Typical of the Russians dumping their scrap metal in the sea and polluting the world.
I trust the Ukrainians.
XD
Mokva ... Mosva ... Jesus, lady, how hard is it to pronounce "Moskva"??? 🙄
aaaaaaw...shame.
It’s now on a special reef building operation.
Moskva on a special underwater mission!
So any actual proof ?
Dam shame 😆 🤣
Hahahahahaha 🤣👍
I’d love to think it was the Ukrainians. But surely they would have filmed the strike? As they must have known the Russians would counter claim that is was due to an accident.
So, the famous ‘denazification of ukraine’ means actually the destruction or autodestruction of the russian army in ukraine?
trying to save face hey poo in a tin.
Slava Ukraina! the Comedian from Kiev just sunk the boat of the mad dog from Moscow...what a humiliation for Russia.😂🙈
Hey pooty Sunk your battel ship 🚢⚓
WAS The Flagship 👍
sinking of happiness celebration
It's all part of their fleet renewal plan. Everything is going according to plan.
Neptune's trident strikes
It was a 60 year old ship hardly Russia's Best.
Excellent news
What is worse? That Ukranians managed to destroy the ship with only 2 missiles or a possible leak of gasses or fluids in the munitions storage? Also how did they miss to intercept only 2 missiles in an active warzone? The ship was retrofitted and had a integrated battle manegement system?
Happy Days!!!!
Let's hope that the Ukranians can send more Russian ships the same way.  Russia had no valid reason to start this war and they should not have it easy.
The ship that was told to go fu** itself sunk. Well thats a huge symbolic victory for ukraine.
Fake Ukrainian missile sinks fake Russian ship. No pictures offers no proof. Not many people are convinced, because new is rampant everywhere now.
Its sunk just as putin planned.....
According to russian officials this was faked by the US
Paper army, paper navy and paper air forces...
Putin: The ship didn't sank!! It was simply reclassified as a submarine..
where is the sink footage?
It’s not sunk, it’s just on a special underwater mission
What about the crew? 510 white Christian sailors. Don’t their lives matter? This war is stupid and must be stopped.
It will make a beautiful reef
😄🙂
About time...👍👍😂
Wonderful news. Does anyone want Russia to prevail in this 'special war operation' that appears to be about razing Ukraine to the ground because Putin's had a hissy fit ? Good riddance to the Moskva. I hope plenty of Russian ships share its fate.
I think that the Russians are amazing how they have time to start building a reef in the middle of a war. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is a symbolic and major victory for the  Ukrainians.. This is worse then when Stalin tried to Invade Finland.
And just exactly how is any Russian better-off as a result of this?
it sunk in stormy weather, two ukrainian neptune missles emerged from the storm out of the blue and collided with the russian battle ship creating a bon fire in the ammunition store that became a fire works celebration as the ukrainians were celebrating the sinking of the russian war ship by to sneaky ukrainian neptune missiles hiding in the storm ready to pounce on the ships ammo dump, the russians claimed it was a fire that lite up the ship, the fire was started by two ukrainian matches that looked remarkably like two neptune missiles, well done ukraine, suffer russian sw^ne
Even had stormy weather if that’s not a sign your on the wrong side of history I don’t know what is
That hurts
Yeah great celebration with thousands of ukrainian soldiers surrendering 😂😂😂😂😂😂
It was just a special operation repair.
How gives a toss about Russia self-inflicted 😁
Haha! The texbook ignominious end.
It was transferred to the underwater (submarines) fleet.
Все идет по плану. Она просто утонула.  Москва- все.
Has it really sunk?, or are they just saying this to  put us off what’s really happening and it’s just gone back to port
Poutine à dit que c'était les alcoolique de marins russes qui ont fumé dans la soute à munitions 🤣😂🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣
Liers
If it sank due to ammunition detonation that is worse than succumbing to missiles, as the latter requires no incompetence, especially if operating that close to shore; avoiding missiles would be all but impossible.
i think it is better suited as a marine reef
It’s just unfortunate this ship wasn’t filled with all the rapists of young girls,boys,woman and dragged to a watery grave!!!!
.    W E L L.      D O N  E.    🇺🇦
Mr Putler must be crying like a baby now 😂
Under the seaaa under the seaaa putin it's better down where it's wetter take it from meee
Everything is going to plan. - Putin
Emotional daaaaammmaaggeeeee!
Why no satellite pics of it sinking?
Only one silo of many at a Russian fuel dump is attacked by air assets. Russia: It was Ukraine! Ukraine: No it wasn't.  Russian flagship blows up and eventually sinks. Russia: It was an accident. Ukraine: We used two Neptune missiles.  Reeeaaally lending credence to that whole "false flag" theory on the fuel dump when Russia is quick to blame a minor inconvenience that lets them play the victim, but tries to internalize something that was a real strategic loss.
👍🏻🙌👍🏻Forget the Neptune missiles... All what was needed was a good slingshot!  Remember that ship was built following russian quality standard, where make beleive is king 🤣 paper thin boat... if not inflatable... 😆
Russia still have nukes. I'm not celebrating just yet, its a bit too soon for my liking!
No way it sunk, liberal media propaganda bunk. The Moscova  is just temporarily under water, resting. And it will be refloated after an archeological dig in the bottom of the Black Sea where the ancient civilization of Atlantis was discovered with the best Russian science and technology has to offer. This media sucks. People are so gullible. Im going back to FOX NEWS where journalistic integrity is the benchmark for the history of fact finding news the world over. Democracy is overrated. TRUMP2024, YEAH, BABY!!
Elation indeed!
Moskva Sinks! Excellent, Well Done Ukraine. 🇬🇧🇺🇦
The way this war is going u cant believe any of them they are all liers so i dont care who wins or loses just rember the brits lost a lot of ships to the argies and still won the war
The Soviet... Oh sorry the "Russian" military is a joke. I bet they don't even have nukes (due to corruption) the Soviet... Oh excuse me "Russian" military is a paper teddy bear.
Shows how warfare has changed
She was simply upgraded to submarine. 😄
Good job Ukraine military
Fighting for their freedom, Joe is napping in the basement
Who's the real terrorist now?
slava ukraine........
The fact they admitted a serious problem meant the ship was destroyed.
1:12 No, we don‘t know.
Hopefully they can stop the Russian navy launching cruise missiles.
At least wen they blow up things they admit it 🤣  so made my day !!!! wouldn't be long before a sub would have  put it under !   in the weeks to come  more old navy will fall  as evil is.no match against GOOD Putin will be stoped  hopefully hung in the streets of Moscow even his people hate him 👹
Under The Sea Life under the sea Is better than anything they got up there. -Moskva
Russian military are doing well aren't they 🤦‍♂️  Does anyone actually fear them any more ?
Glory to Ukraine. I’m just fearful the big tyrant will just pound harder.
The largest comedy in Russia will be May 9 (Victory Day in Russia), when Pussin will try to convince his citizens of any imaginary success related to Ukraine, and worse, many of them will believe it: D Slava Ukraini from Poland!!!
The State Owned Russian News Agency has reported that the vessel has now successfully docked on the seabed from where it will be renamed The Kursk 2...
What wonderful news for an Easter Sunday.
Moskwa do dna 👍
Transformers. Ship and a submarine
Just how incompetent is the Russian military? And we all thought that the Mongolian navy was bad.
👍
USA and Russia seriously must stop intimidating each other via other nations
Special submerged operations
That's a fitting revenge for all those cruise missiles.
Russians are saying it was their incompetence that led to its sinking, this time I tend to agree with them
Very clever of the Russians to intercept Ukrainian missiles using an old warship. Genius really.
want answers? look up the bilderberg group, they have been manipulating society for decades, a group of elite CEO’s acting as world Kings who couldnt care less about democracy but actualy make policies that work against it. hmmmm
hmmm
thats a good news..
[mokva]    LOL
It has't sunk, it was a special underwater mission.
"Ukrainian missiles can't touch us, it was just our own incompetence!"
Скажи-ка, дядя, ведь не даром Москва :) "СПАЛЕННАЯ ПОЖАРОМ" :) Нептуну отдана?
😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
https://youtu.be/Op3R31nMegc full video here
Make Putin pay a huge tremendous cost for the war he started 。in the future some leaders will reconsider before they make a move
LOL! They sank their battleship!
Talk, talk, talk. I want to see credible photos or video.
NOW SINK RUSSIA
It was part of Putin's plan, the Moskva went to denazify the bottom of the Black Sea!😆😆🤣
Very very good ☺️☺️☺️☺️ slava Ukriane
Brilliant!! Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦😀
Moskva sank xD
Warship did what it was asked to do by Ukrainian soldier at the beggining of this war "Russian warship go f...yourself"
whats with mariupol... is it in russuan Hands. ok ??
I love the fact that they say they distracted the crew with a drone, like throwing bananas to the chimps.
Ukraine is like one guy being jumped by 8 others in an alley way and knocking them all out.
*F... of Russian Warship!*
Than they won the war?
😀
I would taken advantage if i was usa
🤣🤣😂
Putin. Give up, move to somewhere hot and spend your days watching marvel. Your nothing but a C U N T !!!????
😂🤣😂🤣 Russia 🇷🇺 getting another beating like Afghanistan all over again lol 😂
😁😁😁🐒🐒SECRET SUBMARINE😁😁😁
Ukrainian saying yay! But when Russia hits back they scream help us fight to the US! Very evident that peace ☮️ isn’t the goal 🥅
Oh dear
The ammunition caught on fire, this is true.  (in small print) Right after it was hit by the Ukrainians.
Not Putins Black Sea is sleeping with the fishes at the bottom. Another positive side, it'll make some good habitat for marine life now.
The Russian army is much bigger but the Ukrainian army is fighting smarter.
It’s just looking for Giant Squids at the bottom of the sea
The end of Russia is approaching.
I am grateful to Russia for its cooperation during the liberation war of Bangladesh in 1971.  But I am ungrateful for Russia's aggression in Ukraine.  Quit this war to save humanity.
I strongly suggest Russia should pack up and go home , their heart just isn’t in this !
the world has sat back fearing the russian military over the years thin king it was a super power of sorts only to see complete incompetence from its generals  and using weapons and vehicle's that are 50 years old wonder if they have looked after there nukes or have any at all???
Good i hope everyone on it did aswell
This thing should not of been sunk by two cruise missles. Sounds like bullshit.
Doesn't matter how, it's now out of the fight and sitting on the seabed. A new diving attraction for when this is all over!.
Putin's latest update: it's all going to plan.
Serves them right! Slava Ukraini, Glory to democracy and freedom!
Why not just stop all the B.S. peace to all.
Yay!!!!👍👍👍😁⚓🚣🏊
14 апреля  110 лет назад затонул Титаник и 14 апреля 2022 года сгорела и затонула фашистская москва .  Слава  Украине !!!
XD Good. Rust in hell.
So what?! Who cares?!
Well done lads and ladies... That is a top target to take out. Shame Putin werent in it.
Public enemy song Fight the power!
Congrats to the moskva for being promoted to a submarine
Soon find out when divers go down to inspect the wreck. If it was an internal explosion, casualties will be enormous. If it was sunk by Ukrainian fire, the casualties will still be enormous. Either way, a huge blow to Russian navy morale, and a huge morale boost to the Ukrainians.  Go Ukrainians, and hit the Ruskis for a sixer.
CNN just posted that this is all because the captain was not double masked
If this level of competence continues Russia will be scrambling to join NATO to protect themselves from Finland.
Good riddance. Let’s hope it took the captain down with it.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
😂 🤣😂🤣😂🤣 excellent work 🇺🇦 👍 Hope that’s left mad vlad red faced ( probably would’ve his blood pressure most likely hit the roof )
Second Moskva ship to be sunk... Lesson to be learned: Never name your ship Moskva again!🤪
Russians turned the ship into a special submarine. Black Pearl or we say in Russian Черная ZемчужZина or just "ZZZZZZZZZZ" 🤣
FAKE NEWS!! The Moskva HAS NOT SUNK!! It is still afloat and is being towed to port for repairs. Why doesn't this zionist channel  post the FACTS and not just repeat the Ukrop propaganda?
Another small step towards Russian military annihilation. Now I got: they are denazifying and demilitarising themselves!
ALL APPROVED;
Not a cruise ship, but a cruiser. By far the largest ship in the Black Sea fleet and an important anti-air and missile platform. Congratulations to the Ukrainian shore defence.
Didn't see sink anything in this report.
GOOD JOB/UKRAINE!!ALL THE DESTROyed tanks ..etc...ohh-well!!
Currently conducting special operations by firing bubbles from the bottom of the ocean
Putin said the sinking of Moskva was part of Putin's war strategy. Sky News just doesn't get it. The Special Operation Z is going exactly according to Putin's plan.
Why cant the two statements both be real. The ship was hit and set the ammo ablaze and it sank the ship.
Good riddance!
Hahahahahahahahaaaaaa FU putin!
Actualy it didnt sink as even American intelegence says,it is simply damaged,and now crew evacuated and now dragged to Sevastopol for repairs as far as i know.
***RUSSIA needs turkish laser, or and Cram gattling gun to defend against Anti ship missiles. What was Radar etc doing??**
Russia's going to have to ask China for their ships back 🤣
I watch RT and haven head its sunk
Well done Ukraine! Here's hoping that the Moskva will be for Putin what the Bismark was for Hitler.
Excellent news !!
Another One bites the dust ☺️ or in this case, another one bites the bottom 😜
I'm trying to imagine how Putin is dealing with this. He must be absolutely incandescent with rage. It's brilliant....
Epic
Hihi
The battleship was built and sank same way as the Titanic.  🤣🤣
Crew training is priority that may prove to be lacking in Russian navy
Well done
Rest in peace Moskva 1980-2022
Where is the sinking? Fake news and propaganda news as always
That's it? That's all it takes to sink it? Why am i having so much trouble sinking this ship in WG: Red Dragon.
strategically placed man made reef
The dreaded summons from two Mockba's are on the way. The captain must decide which one to honor. Not an enviable position.
The more we keep celebrating these things, the angrier Putin will get... and more likely he'll blow Ukraine off the face of the Earth with a few nukes ..  maybe we should all shut up for a bit and stop poking the bear... then maybe, just maybe they will negotiate a ceasefire.... but it won't happen if UK, EU, USA and all media outlets keep up this hyper media nonsense.
It is now a stationary submarine hahahaha
Speaking lies a good habit. Damaged do not mean sinking. Building wrong narratives born habit of western media's dna.
*ASÍ ERA, JA JA JA QUE FELICIDAD QUE  ESTE AHORA DESTRUIDO.*
Yeah didn't see it sink liars
Well, Russia have another 5000 ships, pretty sure it isn't that 'breaking' news...  not exactly a game changer
AhaahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahHahahahhhaahhAhhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah 👍🏻💪🏻💪🏻
The Bully is getting  it,s just rewards ……The world apart from shithouse despot country’s is loving it
American News Services are SO amazingly ignorant - - ABC called the Moskva  a "Battleship" &  MSNBC called it a  "Missle Cruise Ship" !  Glad it is gone !  Glory to Ukraine !
What excellent news!
The Russian Regime and the Oligarchs are the World's Largest Criminal Syndicate and Network! Corrupted Fraudsters of the Russian People and the World!
Russians lying again, vessels just don't sink unless hit by something like a missile
Lol
the denazification of the Black sea continues as planned... 🤪🤣. Go Ukraine! 🇧🇪🇺🇦
#ijustsunkyourbattleship I won
Nobody will miss it. ☺️ Happy Easter
HAHA, good! SLAVA UKRAINI!
Amazing what a couple of Ukrainian fishermen in a row boat with a Javelin missile or two can do.  Слава Україні ! 🇺🇦
It's not sinking...it is a special operation in advancing downwards.  Blurp blurp blurp
I can't wait for the memes on this
That ship committed many atrocities and massacres in Syria,  this is karma folks.
This is ukrainian and american lie. Warship is not sinking.
Ukraine does not have a fleet, but it sinks the ruSSian flagship 😂
I can't believe any organization could be more incompetent than the Russian army!  Russian Navy:  "Hold my vodka...."
Perfect storm! <3 Glory to Ukraine! <3
In the words of Nelson from the simpsons .....haha
Ukraine 🇺🇦 ❤️ be wisely 👌 pray and wisdom 🙏 🙌 👏 let see 👀 win again 🙏 victory ✌️ comes sooner 🙏 Ukraine 🇺🇦 ❤️ 😀
Dear Comrades, the Moskva after gallantly defeating the Western imperialists, and denazifying Ukraine, was ordered by Dear Leader, comrade Vladimir Putin to undertake a 'special military operation' below sea shore in preparation for Victory Day celebrations. Ahoy Comrades!
Everybody is okay  This was just a special fishing operation
These guys are pushing Russia to use its Nuke!
Maybe it didn't get hit at all and just accidentally went on fire after firing at the Ukrainian drone. It's hard to know who to believe.
didnt russia once tell the USA that this missile ship was better than carriers ?
Awesome!
Well done Ukraine, the fascist occupants lost one of their three ships.
Russia is going to LOSE this war, this is exactly what he gets for being arrogant and thinking it was going to be easy, now Ukrain weather got their butts. History repeats itself over and over again, when things like this happens it tells me that a fall is going to happen, meaning he and his regime. History never lies.
Massive slap for Putin, having his flagship sunk by a country that doesn't even have a navy.
Old news..,
Bloody marvellous.  Ukraine needs now to capitalise on this and sink more if they can.  The blow to Putin would be huge as he couldn’t keep up the pretence that it was an accident.  Putin, like his flag ship, is dead in the water and sinking fast.
Ukrainiyan tracktors be mad they can't go under water and get the ship
Y fue bendecido x el patriarca  ortodoxo ruso. ! Y así se hundió?. Se fue al infierno al que le mandó el Ucraniano de la Isla de las🐍s. Seguro que fue bendición?
Good riddance, soviet pigs 🐖
1 more of this please. Before the entire fleet sinks
The ship Moscow shows the future Moscow. Whole Russia are going under..
They avenge the antonov
wonder where the NEPTUNE missiles came from ,given they are street fighting with molotov cocktails & ex Iraqi AK47`s
Amazing the media expects truth out of Russia
Bodies will wash up on the shores of Ukraine. Winds are blowing towards Ukraine.
Outstanding
Special Military Disaster continues. Great job, Ukraine.
That Admiral sleeps with the fishes.
Russia just announced the Moscova has been transferred to the Submarine fleet and will be taking part in operations on the sea floor in the Black Sea doing a critical special operation for mother Russia
great news! a black eye for the black sea fleet and putin ina mo (filipino foul word)
Special Sinking Operation
This is Great News let’s sink and other on y’a.
Being the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, it ,might have had a Admiral, or, the commander of the fleetship.
Well ukraine scrap merchants would  like ship $$$$there
Hahahaha. Eat dust Russians!!!!
DoN't drink and sail Moskova
Kurst submarine brought CURSE to this Ship ... both Sunk
TURKEY is big liar ,  TURKEY  supports RUSSIA in every corner  , TURKEY  saved 54 Russian soldiers on the RUSSIAN  ship hit by UKRAINE . (according to lithuania sources)
LOL what a pos. Russian Flagship is a tugboat to compared to americas flagships
*I LIVE ON THE BLACK SEA COAST*   there is NO stormy weather - it was warm and sunny and no wind yesterday...
Putin and Lavrov: "That is not our flagship. That is a double."
I like when everyone in comment suddenly become Military analysis
👍🏾
Proud Russian Navy history.  Here.  😂   https://youtu.be/yzGqp3R4Mx4
Where the actual footage?? Why just statement lol
So, on russian map there is no moskva anymore.
Russia will never tell the truth,
UKRAINE IS GIVING RUSSIA HELL. RUSSIA IS GONNA LOSE THIS WAR IN ALOT OF WAYS IT ALREADY HAS. I SAID MONTHS AGO UKRAINE WAS GONNA BLOODY RUSSIA NOSE.
BBC news said  that it sailed back to Krimea for repairs.  It's the fog of war.
too bad poo 💩 tinman the 🤡 wasnt on it. he and his civilian killing commanders need a ride on sadams swing.
Good riddance
So, the navy is just as competent as their army then.
RUSSIA IS BLUFFING WHEN HE ATTACKS I PREFER SWEDEN AND FINLAND JOIN NATO....GO...GO...GO...
Ukrainian to the World 🌎
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdM5Pkyl0_8
Putin just added a submarine vessel to his Black Sea fleet.
Where is the video showing how its sinking
Fake news,, ship is back in the port.. low life fake news
Ukraine is dethroning Russia as a World super power, lessons learned by other bullies( United States and China) while some undermined nations also learn how to stand up to future bully.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Great news. Probably responsible for many indescriminate killings
I was singing "Glad all over" by Dave Clarke five, as I had breakfast. Magnificent news. Rejoice !!!
The curse of the heroic Ukrainian soldiers killed in the Island by the Russian Moskva sailors are still hunted that ship to its graveyard. Now it went down to F,,,ing himself under the sea as the Ukrainian soldiers predicted  7 weeks ago.
Russia always win stop misleading them to the war they will never win
it didn't sink ...it is special military operation submarine
Soviet era? So at least 30+ years old & that’s their flagship? 👀
How moskva replace the s300s they use? They do it underway or they needed to dock?
I guess it was payment for the antonov :D
good it turned into coral reef. great job
Ukraine weapon is called Benzema....
Damn that ship and all of its operators.
Yes indeed. The Ukrainians have done it again. Absolutely awesome.
Isn't there a Tom Clancy book about this?
Oops!  Those onboard fires can have nasty consequences.
Why Russia started what couldn't end? I feel the pain of Putin....Heavy weapons without mental ability is complete stupidity....Russia got the weapons but Ukraine has the strategy......
Outstanding
SLAVA UKRAINI!
Bully was proven in this world!
Stop Putin, stop evil!
Great news! Sink Putin next
World should sink the entire Russia
It is now officially part of the Russian submergible fleets flagship. They should do this to all their ships. And they can start selling tickets to the submarine races...😛
meanwhile on russian state tv BREAKING: Black Sea fleet flagship Moskva *transforms into a submarine*
i do not see a sinking ship     words tell is sinking but i not see it
Russian Trolls have tucked tails between legs and retreated back to caves 😂🤣😄😅😆
There's an abject lesson in history in 1940 during the winter war between Finland and USSR. The Soviets attacked Finland and lost as many as 200,000 soldiers and huge amount of war materials in just a few months of combat.Thus shaping up World openion specially the Germans that Soviet army is inept, incompetent and weak.Rich in arms but unschooled in tactics. But they eventually subjugated Finland. Size and numbers really matters. Now, what happens in Ukraine is eerily a mirror of what happened in 1940 though unlike Finland in 1940 Ukraine now has the sympathy and support of the free world. This is still a very dangerous time for Ukraine. Hope peace will be restored soon and further destructions avoided.
Some should tell Putin  we are in 21st century we want peace
And on day #50 of the war Putin's plan was to sink his flagship warship...medals to be handed out.
Save Ukraine, save Russia, save our world. Wash/Clean out Vladimir Putin because He is the Amoral Christian Leader which kill and make suffer so many His/Our Brothers
No Video Material about HOW it was sinking...smells a bit
The Moskva did not sink!  It was executing a special underwater operation.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👍👍👍👍👍👍
Delightfully good news!  And hopefully more offensive actions to come!
I do not see any dispute in he statements from Kyiv and Moscow . Kviv tells the 1st part of the story, Moscow the second and happily final part of the story.
Putin"s Residence is locationed on the blacK sea also(already in the hand of GOD/NATO)amen
The possibilities that the Russian Defence Ministry did not elaborate the reason of the fire that leads to the sinking of the ship: 1. Their radar did not detect the missile and no one has seen the missiles visually when they struck. 2. All the have operated the radar system or on look out are dead or most of the crew are dead.
Ukraine can use it as a tourist attraction as a diving park after they win the war, Hopefully adding a few more to the collection...
Realy russia, u want is to believe it sank on its own in a war zone...
If Ukraine didnt shoot it and it just blew up man Russia is embarrassing itself. Bunch of flunky troops that signed on yesterday to go play paint ball wars. They lose everything.
I hope they sink them all.
Karma!
If they were not such inbreed alcoholic throwbacks, they might fight worth a damn.
I think Putin hired Magician Copper Field made that Warship sank for fun then will appear to new location. Wait and see for three days.
👏 sunk! Yeah!
Excellent,,this is what it would be like if trussia fought the United States. It would be a turkey shoot,,thier navy and army are weak
Why would we "fear" that the Moscow had sunk? We are ELATED!!!
Dr. Evil saying to rusky officials claims:" riiight..."
God did justice to the soldiers on the island of snakes.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Special ship bonfire operation
They distract the crew with drones so their Typhoons could hit past its anti air? These Ukraine surely go all in and are very sneaky:)
👏🏼 👌🏼
why all of your post breaking news
Imagine if ALL the Military ships from All the Country's All suddenly sank, None. I can dream!!!!
From Ukraine with love
Awesome
This is like Russo - Japanese War All Over again. Russia has a powerful army at that time and also a strong navy. But japanese discipline destroyed the Russian in Manchuria and Korea.
I really hope it's just one of many steps that leads to downfall of that "galactic empire". And putintine shall meet his end from the hands of his own man. Na pohybel ruskim onucom
Missile warfare now. One crucial hit and the target will be history.

So there is one Russian ship down and tons of strange comments! Ok so Ukraine will know win the war because of one ship? Oh that's right Ukraine has no navy with no ships left 🤣.
Just think about it... In just about A week, Ukraine attacked A fuel depot in Russia in by helicopter, attacked a forward air base by Soviet era ballistic missiles, and a country that has no navy just took out the flagship of a "major?" millitary fleet.. Looks like that 10yrs of American millitary advisor training has paid off for Ukraine!
oops
Moskva Sinking Special Drill.
A partial revenge for Mariupol, if the crews went down with it.
This is good news. Either Ukraine missiles hit this ship(the very likely out come) or Russia naval crews are so incompetent they cannot sailor properly and set fire on their own ship(most likely Russian propaganda). I am gonna go with Ukrainians explanation in this one.
This what happen when your missile launcher is exposed from enemy attack
Russia's "special operation"  just got a new submersible vehicle.
Good hope the complete fleet is sunk ,what Russia is doing to Ukraine and it's people is Horrendous and barbaric and Putin needs putting to justice for his war crimes .
How can this happen without lost of life or injuries?
The slinghots of David seems hitting hard the armour of Goliath!!!
Too much vodka
Good news 👏 for  Ukraine 🇺🇦 against putin invaders the Russians flag ship has sunk who has killing innocent people  on the train  station  with missle strike s.
Special underwater operation
The Russian Flag Ship sank?  Outstanding!  That's got to be a costly loss to the Russians.  Well done, Ukraine!!!  Eric
The ship was tactically deployed underwater. mission success. urrAahh Russia
Slava class. VERY FORMIDABLE. WTG UKRAINE!!!
They sunk your battleship, game over! Get out russia!!! Ukraine 🇺🇦 🇺🇸 USA
FAKE
🤣Haha yeah right. Keep wishing!
Even America  was embarrassed  by  Vietnam   and Somalia  .War is war let them  slag it on
More lies from Sky.
Well done Ukraine…The Russians only ever had two competent generals in their history….General January and General February…😀
It wasn't a cruise missile strike it was a  disassembly of the ship by Ukrainians.
If few thousand man wasn't enough for Putin to engage his nuclear forces, maybe a ship would... Come on, get on with the nukes already, don't let the audience waiting...
🥳
The Russian military all around has turned into the laughing stock of the entire world.
🇺🇦🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🇺🇦 congratulations Ukraine!!!
Seems like the 15th April is a bad day to be on any ship..
Putin: NO NO it wasn't from an attack! The flagship is actually a POS that could not even survive a fire on deck !  LONG LIVE UA!
Grate work
👏👏👏👍🇺🇦❤🧿
The entire world is seeing what a joke the Russian military really is
I heard it had a fire on board and was towed to port
So, are they seriously saying that they sank their own battleship? And, that's supposed to make them look...  better, somehow?  Russia:   _'No, no, ship was not sunk by enemy missiles. Ship was sunk by... shift change. Is upgrade. Now, glorious, magnificent flagship... is potato.'_
SMOKE. THAT. PACK.
It was a routine redeployment. Everything is going according to plan. SLAVA Ukraine!!!
Pity Putin wasn't on board...
Underwater special operations
This ship attacked innocent people so this earned result .
Plot twist: Putin, what happened to submarine Kursk? It’s just sunk 🙃 How about Moskva? Well, Kursk needed a friend…. 🥺
It got sunk while being towed? Man, those Ukrainian tractors are EVERYWHERE. :D
If this is true. Wake up Mr. Putin, God is not in your side.
This was a strategic win, It was launching cruise missiles all across Ukraine.  On the bright side for Russia, they gained another submarine.
Ukrainians sank a battle ship named Moscow. If only God would send signs this clear.
This cuts Russia's global force projection quite a bit. The Russian Navy can't afford losses like this.
o well they should have putin a plug to stop the leak...
incompetence-incompetence-incompetence
So beautifull. Moscow has been sunk. Ship AND country. I can only wonder the courage and ingenuity of fighting Ukrainians.
Fabulous news. Slava Ukraini
It'll make a better reef than a warship
It’s now “The snake island memorial reef”.
It was a storm. Ruski media said lol they are getting bigger losers then N korea
Russians put out the fire by placing the ship under the sea. All according to plan. :D
Russia could be telling the truth. They didn't know they got hit and assumed it was a fire. Yeah let's go with fire.
It is now the Snake Island Memorial Wreath
It did not sink. It went and f**ked itself.
Bravo Ukraine! Target all their heavy warships and sink all of them!
On april 14 it is still unknown what happened to ship.
This war is costing Russia alot keep it up Ukraine
Bullies never  win,  hope the Ukrainians remain resilient.
wheres the vid of the missile sinking it?
English news, nothing but cap again 🤣🤡
Sunk at sea while in tow. Reports stormy seas finished her off. Black sea weather reports says no stormy seas. False flag to justify big offensive starting. If  true of the sinking https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDjwUzUnNpU
Ukrainian solution to building a new reef off the coast out of Russian scrap metal. Glory to Ukraine!  🇦🇺🇺🇦
I heard a Ukrainian boy threw a rock at it and it sank.
Did the captain go down with the ship? If so, that's another military leader lost. 🤞
Excellent - 🇺🇦🇬🇧  Best wishes to Ukraine her Armed Forces and people.
RT NEWSFLASH !! Ship is also Submarine !  Special Underwater Sea Operation demonstrates advanced Russian "Transformer technology" !  All glory to mother Russia and great leader Putin who personally negotiated with Decepticon Leader Megatron for technology exchange.  "Decadent Western nations think Autobots will protect them from this powerful and intimidating new weapons platform, they are wrong !" says Putin  "This ship can stay underwater for months or even years" Putin says  "Great Leader Putin will keep the ship underwater until the Ukrainians surrender and maybe even longer" says Peskov  When contacted for comment President Zelenskyy was unable to answer due to some sort of hysterical laughing fit...
Perfect. 2.x Neptunes and down goes Russias Glory ha ha ha
That's a lie! It's merely conducting a "Special Sea Bottom Physical Contact Mission"!!
Russia claims ship sunk while towed. Probably by a Ukrainian tractor. :D
Well done !
Up yours, orks
It should have sunk with its 500 russian crew. That would have been icing on the cake.
Don't be shocked. The sinking of this cruise ship is already part of the plan and It is noble..
🤣😂😂🤣😂😂🤣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
I follow the Moskva, in the Azov Sea, and listening to the sound, of her sinking ....
This is only the delicious beginning. As more advanced weapons arrives from America, Great Britain and Europe,the cretin Putin will no longer be able to fire missiles at civilian targets with impunity. The Ukrainian warriors are going to beat him like a drum at a rock concert. Mark these words, by the time Ukraine is done with those crazed junkies Putin sent to pillage ,rape and murder innocent civilians, Russia will need more body bags than they can produce.
It have an under water mission, everything is on plan
To quote... Russian ship, go sunk yourself! And they did😁
No sinking...is special underwater humanitarian operation to create Snake Island Artificial Reef.
A new addition to the artificial reef in the Black Sea.
No. It didn’t sink. It has submerged.
Oh is Putin screwed!
Slave class cruiser of the old Soviet Union...
Terrible destruction machine. i support the sinking of the flag ship, together with its crew
Ammunition tends to catch fire after being hit with 2 missiles.
We know the truth. Ukraine sank the Moskva. Russian spokesmen lie every time they open their mouths. There should be zero doubt that Ukrainian forces did exactly what they said the did. Slava Ukraini!
If the Russians did set themselves on fire, then the Russian Warship did "Go F themselves!" Karma.
Maybe Russia will have better success putting the ships on land and the tanks in the sea. :D
With all the technology today.....no footage   ???
It's rather like the battle between David and Goliath in the Bible. David was able to win with only a pebble and a sling and no armor, while Goliath had a shield, armor, and sword.
footage or it never happened ..
Russian ship was made in China.🤣🤣🤣👍
As a result of the food shortages due to this war, the Black Sea being hungry gobbled the Russian cruiser.
🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🌻🌻🌻
I heard that it didn’t sink soooo?
Now transformed into a submarine, too bad Putin didn't go down with it like a good skipper would.
The end of big battle ship era
Yayyy. Best news of the day!!!
In a war, there will.be losses on all the participants, all the time, what counts is who eventually, ends up winning...
Very good congrats Ukrainian destroy them all
0:16 cruiseship  Is this the Russian Costa Concordia?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwAQOiUJHa8&ab_channel=ZeihanonGeopolitics
These are NATO missiles fired by NATO proxy Ukrainian soldiers. Let us be clear, This is NATO at war with Russia hiding deceptively by claims of NATO not being involved. NATO fires the shots, Ukraine suffers the reaction and casualties. NATO is not a peace keeping force, it is the aggressor maintaining world economic domination, propping up the failed fiat US petrol dollar. US Navy Seals do operate in secret in different theatres of conflict. This is why secrecy is so important and whistle blowers reporting the truth reveal what is really going on.
they say the ship might be carrying nuclear warheads
The Moskva was the key to attacking the southern cities in Ukraine. This is not merely a symbolic victory. The loss of the Moskva changed the tide, tempo, and conditions of war. Everything has changed now. The Moscva was the closest thing Russia had to a final boss in the region. They can't replace this.
Good. That is where it belongs.
Hahaha 😂😁😺
Best news will be if Puting was inside.
The fleet Admiral and Captain will be on their way to the gulag.
💪💙🙏💛💪
It is David against Goliath...
Idiots + vodka + cigarettes + ammo storage = Russian Navy 👏👍.
They lie about everything
A set-back and a military embarrassment - no doubt  But the Russian capability to learn, resupply and defend against such an attack in future, is far greater than the Ukrainian capability to carry out similar attacks. Of course, Ukrainian would not be impaling themselves on the Russian military had not NATO, since 1992 and under no provocation from Russia, insisted on moving ever closer to Russian borders. This is not a war Ukraine can win. It will end, with two countries - West and East Ukraine. East Ukraine will see massive investment by the Chinese who will benefit from its vast agricultural resources and Western Ukraine will be financially heavily indebted to the USA and EU. Debt corruption and blackmarkets is all Western Ukraine will habe to look forward to🤷🏾‍♂️
A ship turned into submarine.
Nice! Eat lead
silly Russian propaganda: we blew it up ourselves
👍🇺🇦☮️
Wow! Their Navy is as capable as the Army. Most Navies would have trained their crews on Damage Control. Plus the crew abandonned ship all at once.
Congratulations to Russia on their newest submarine - Moskva 🤪🤣
Hooray….
I am happy it sunk
oh snap
A Persian proverb says: mountain does not reach mountain, but man reaches man. Now we have to say that the Russian warship reaches the Russian warship. (Of course at the bottom of the sea). 😉🤭😅
Lol
The Russian army has had the worse performance of any  countries military in living memory, the Russian Navy “HOLD MY BEER”!
It was just a grease fire in the galley that caused this.
Get F#ck Russian warship!
Horee, GLORY UKRAINE
That is alot of firepower off the board.
Russian news agency : "We are testing submerging the boat to eliminate future chance of fires caused by Russian incompetence, and definitely not Ukrainian missles."
Cleaver Ukrainians;  slow, dim-witted Russians
Dear Comrades: The first stage of the Fire Drill and Recover Special Operation is complete and is going according to plan. The Chechen underwater force will recover the ship from the bottom of the sea to complete the operation by the glorious May celebration.
Russian intruders are being defeated by the Ukrainian forces!
It was ammunition "On Board"  but some recently received which then exploded had not been "on Board'  for more than a millisecond before it exploded !!
Good luck claiming your fake victory now on may 9th Russia. 🤣🤣
AMERIKA HAHAHHAHHAHHHAAHAH🤮🤮🤮
Latest news from RT state TV. Moskova has sunk. Russian sources stated "Moskova is actually a submarine and was fully expected to sink. This is all going according to plan"   😃😝🤣😂🤩
Good news!
Straight down to Davey Jones' locker 😂🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇲🌎
It transformed into a submarine, new Russian technology
This is Sparta!
Viva ukrain💙💛👍👍👍✌✌✌✌
Special Maritime Operation by Russia to shoot ourselves in the foot.
Lol freedom convoy happens.. 1 month later Ww3
Glory to the UKRAIN and glory to all the UKRANIAN  people fighting for the freedom of UKRAIN and the rest of the world death to to Putin and his followers
Either way, it's a win !!
Congratulations, Ukraine, on your new artificial reef!
We currently have no idea how deep the Moskva sank.  It is a Soviet era 40+ years old ship.  The Back Sea is up to 7000+ feet deep.  It would appear recovery is economically unfeasible.  While we currently don’t know if the fire was the result of an accident or the result of a Ukrainian weapon, both are embarrassing to the Russians.   Either way it reveals a continuity of weakness in the Russian military.  Morale will continue to sink with Russian ships.
Modern day David destroys Goliath
Yes it was refitted along with the russian submarine Kursk.   I hope this captain went down with his ship.🥴
No..It was distracted by a drone and then the 2 missles fired from a land base system hit it...Ukraine.".hey look at my left hand" ...right hand K.O. 🤣
Damaged by Ukranian missile is fake. For a missile strike would surely kill some,  but all people on board has been evacuated to safely,  which but shows there the cause serms to be an accident
I can't wait to visit Ukraine one day and go diving at the Moskva coral reef. Going to be some great sightseeing during that dive.  I wonder how many Russian graveyards I'll tour while I'm there 👍  Edit: I'll also visit the Russian tank junkyard while I'm in Ukraine as well. Going to be a great vacation destination.
It is exploded from fire couses not from ukranian missilies, even usa confirmed it. Do not imagine too much, this is normal can happen in any operation any time.
Good
Die Russia!
" Our special military operation is going exactly according to plan comrade. We had planned all along to turn the Moskva into a submarine and allowed it to spontaniously combust, thus denying Ukraine the chance to be resupplied with missiles. All 510 crew members were completely uninjured  in the 2 massive explosions, and in particular our comrades who's sleeping compartments were hammocks stung between the missiles in storage were uninjured. There will be no military funerals because we never lost a single sailor. The Moskva will now become a permanent undersea observation post, so that we can keep an eye on the rest of our naval forces up close. We do expect that during the next few weeks, we will also be converting more of our ships into submarines too. "
Keep fighting Ukrainian people fight for your life fight for your home your country that land is yours
😁
Remember Russia is fighting NATO in Ukraine. I just don't understand why Putin has not decided to used some small Nukes to just end this war.
Me thinks ol Vlad is gonna be a bit pi$$ed over this one!
They got overconfident. No such thing as invincible in war.
this is a special victory for Ukraine… well done
Which should worry Russians more, that it's warships are vulnerable to Ukrainian missiles or crew  incompetence is causing ships to explode?
Any Simpsons fans?  I'm thinking of Nelson...."Ha, ha!" 👉
Putin - it is going into special submarine mode operation
Ukraine story -- The hit the ship with a Neptune Anit-ship missle.  That led to a fire on the ship.  The fire caused an apparent ammo explosion leading to the ship sinking in stormy weather as other ships attempted to assist it.   Russia story - There was an ammo explosion on the ship leading to it sinking in stormy weather as it was being towed back to port.  The incident is under investigation.   ROFLMAO -- The Russian lose a $750 Million dollar ship that they lack the parts now and money to replace, and they either lost it to ONE missile from Ukraine .. or .. lost it due to more military incompetence leading to an ammo explosion.  An either case the Russians are looking more and more like the three stooges.  Another interesting fact is the Missile Cruisers of the Russians were based on the long discarded Battle Cruiser principles.  IE Lots of fire power but they sacrifice armor and protection for speed.  That has always proved to be a weak point in such ships as one big hit and boom.  And this appears to prove the point.  Their armor is weak for a modern cruiser.  So one missile could do massive damage and start a fire that could easily reach ammo storage areas again due to weak armor as it was packed for fire power purposes.  More Russian stupidity of design lol.
Yay 😃!
Russian New:"Moksa is now conducting a Special Under the Sea Operation"
Davy Jones locker.
It didnt sink, its conducting a Special Under the Sea Operation.
That's why it needs Defensive AA consumable. And a super-heal.
Never expect a sunken ship could bring so much joy to the world.
The Snake Island 13 saga comes full circle. Poetic.
Ukraine should issue an updated stamp with a soldier doing double middle fingers, whilst the Moskva sinks in the distance. Make it an NFT too so people can bid in an international auction on an anti war NFT immortalizing the ignominy of Putin's "special" war..
Mockba has new mission...to function as submarine to find Vladimir Square Pants and his underwater pinapple house and see if he harbors Ulkainians.
The name "Moskva" indicates that Russia will be defeated totally.
Putin will be screaming his tits off
The black pirate butcher ship was blown up and sank
Never knew Russian military is 💩 af
Loads of rubbish
Fire or Ukranian missile attack Moskva a rocket firing ship is sunk & out the fight for ever , a small help to the Ukraine's & a big loss to the Putin lead aggressor's , the Ukraine's have a way to go in halting the Russian war machine & the west needs to supply Ukraine's more weapons & a faster supply . Give them the tools & they will finish the job in this Danial verses Golieth fight .
It has not sunk.  It was really a submarine in disguise and has just dived for a secret mission.
it was a NOBLE sinking :) Love it
Ships have explosions after being hit with missiles
What a Noble Sinking! 🤣😂😅
Sunk? No, they decided to turn it into a Submarine instead!  🤣😂😅
It has not sunk! Putin just ordered that the Moskva should regroup with the submarine fleet in order to launch a devastating and denazifying attack to the ukrainian underwater fauna.
Who lives in a pineapple under the sea... Vladimir Squarepants
Ring around the shoreline.
Well, at least it isnt on fire anymore.
lol.
Bravo Ukrainian .......sink all their ships NOW .
Yeah the ammunition did catch on fire. I wonder how that happened 🤔
Ukraine is looking for a nuclear bomb from Russia. US did it in WWll and Russian is probably thinking they also have the right to Nuk a country that has special interest for them. This is getting hotter by the minute and I seriously doubt Russia will ever retire from that war since they know NATO is looking to convert Ukraine in one out theirs specially if Russia retreats. Russia knows that allowing Ukraine to be part of NATO is a serious danger to their super power control and they will do what ever it takes to control Ukraine even going to the use of nuclear weapons so I think we haven’t seen the worst to come yet. And NATO is playing with the tigers tail. The world is today in more danger than people actually imagine even our government lead by the most incompetent President in US history followed by his VP and every single appointed official on this administration. This is a fact… and I hope I’m wrong about Russias intentions on the use of mass force to attend their goals.
the amount of people here in comments that are supporting  a regime that killed its own civilians for 8 years is incredible! .. thats crazy y'all blind!! Unbelieavable
PRESIDENT   VLADIMIR PUTIN  LOOSE  A VERRY SPENCER SHIP FOR SOME MISSION ,   BUT  VLADIMIR PUTIN  STILL OVER RUSSIA BECAUSE  THE  SHIP WAS MORE VALID  THAN VLADIMIR  PUTIN   THE CHIKEN ONE  ,  POOR VLADIMIR  DOSENT COST NOTHING .HIS SHIP HAD  A HIGHER PRICE  , NOT VLADIMIR  !
i want russian airliner shootdowns where the russian airliner shootdowns
Glory to Ukraine!
Good.
Russia saying it was a fire doesn't make them look better.  It makes them look incompetent.  Saying it sank from a storm also doesn't look good.  It's pretty obvious they're lying and it's kind of pathetic.
Sounds like the ship was over-designed and over-loaded - so it didn't handle it's first mission very well under combat, and that is to float.   The first job of a ship is to float.   So many Russian designed and built military hardware are junk.
!!^^..  ,;;  I beg the world to do more with this barbaric fascist Putin. Stop doing business with fascist Russia Putin now. Supplying more and more weapons to Ukraine  ;;;.., ..,'
Was losing the Moscow for the Russians like the British losing the Hood and the Germans loosing the Bismarck in loss of prestige?
Wait till the US Harpoons arrive.  If Ukraine’s missile can hit the Russians best warship. US tech will wreck em. That ship is supposed to have the best air defense of their navy. I guess not.
Yes, no doubt about it.  A sailor with a cigarette that somehow didn't go overboard set off the munitions locker and caused the ship to catch fire, the crew to abandon ship, and require a tow to port.  I gotcha.
Awsome news!!!
Excellent!
Well Russia is not known for their honesty, So I am more to believe Ukraine that they helped out.  Good for Ukraine.
750 million dollars ship down the drain. Now putin will have to sell one of his oligarchs yachts to build a new flagman - oh wait they're sanctioned.
I still think some ex-Seal posing as a cook had something to do with this.
Old battle axe dumped in ocean 😂
And did the Russian Captain went down with it?
ASSUMING THE RIA EXPLANATION IS CORRECT, WHEN A UKRAINIAN DEFENDER SAYS "RUSSIAN WARSHIP, GO F**K YOURSELF," THEY MEAN WHAT THEY SAY.
Moskva sleeps with the fishes
Ukrainians are indeed very brave..it is astonishing.
Vodka contributed to the sinking as they were too busy drinking to make time to put out the fires! Slava Ukraine!!
Really..... Sunk. I doubt it  Fake News from Ukraine.     Just like all" the Russian's are targeting civilians "  and the fake Bucha massacre by Russians. ,and the fake slaughter of Ukrainians on Snake island, and fake the ghost of Kiev story and the fake story of the armoured vehicle running over the civilian car. And  the fake chemical weapons story. Basically the West is promoting a losing side because it seeks to destroy Russia. Fat chance of that. The only thing really happening is more innocent Ukrainians are dying. Russia has pretty much completed it's mission to rescue Russian sympathetic people in the east who were about to be attacked by the amassed Ukraine military  .Now those Ukrainian forces are surrounded and are continuously offered surrender terms. Otherwise the Russians will be forced to eradicate them.
RT headline: Moskva stays submarged after successfuly destroying 2 anti-ship missiles.
Good
If there wasn't an orchestra playing when the ship went down I'm gonna be terribly upset.
I’m sure the Neptune missiles fired by the Ukrainians caused no damage at all to the ship. It only sunk because a member of the crew burnt some toast and it started a chain reaction with the ammo stores on board the ship.
Russia needs to use large missels to take the Ukraine... Getting rid of old weapons like old tanks and old ships is just giving Ukraine a big red usa head. They now  think they will get the arms to actually invade Russia... Send in the big weapons from miles away.... Take out all bridges runways roads key buildings one city at a time and keep it up till they surrender
"Hearing that is has sunk" ok, so with 4000+ satellites and  countless drones being in the sky, we still havent seen any confirmation pictures yet, report after report, yet no proof. I'm not doubting they did it, but considering the amount of footage we've seen of Russian tanks being blown skyhigh etc.
the message is clear moscow will sink to the depths by following the orders of a despot putin
Served right  ,glorious ukraini
putin needs to give it up and  home, we always thought russia was strong now other than nukes they look weak. the bright side to this i think china is having second thoughts about Taiwan .
Karma is a nightmare eh Russia 👎🏻
🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦💥💥💥💥🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦  GO UKRAINE!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂🤣😂
Two Ukrainian 'broomsticks' sunk the flagship of the Russian invaders' navy, and for sure it brought along hundreds of Russian sailors with it.
Now it can do some deep sea reconnaissance. Russians are too smart.
I believe it was hit by the Harpoon missile
Watch for President Biden to singlehandedly take the credit for the sinking....
5he Ukrainians built it 40 years ago and now they paid them back or destroying the world BIGGEST... cargo jet....Myra
👇😎🖕
HA HA! It Sunked after denying it wasn't hit but a fire broke out. To be honest why would a fire breakout on a Flagship so Well Designed? LOL
its all b.s.   skynews suks.
I believe some of the Russian ship crew probably helped sink the ship, they are tired of this asinine war.
SLAVA UKRAINE ✌️🇺🇦❤️
СЛАВА УКРАИНЕ ✌️🇺🇦❤️
That was in February???
Lol... Russian military is actually a joke. Can't beat a farmers army ha ha
America and NATO are at war with Russia, killing Ukrainians .. a good plan to destroy Ukraine .Good job☝😂
Shame.. always found something endearing about Russian vessels, from an aesthetic perspective
what a humiliation. well deserved. time to declare victory & end this embarrassment.
If it was sunk by the Ukrainians then it seems those anti missile systems on board aren't worth a pinch of pelican poop.
We should celebrate 🥳
For Sale:  Used missile cruiser Low hours New paint Slight water damage  Make an offer.
Either the Ukrainians hit the flagship of the Black Sea fleet with missiles or the Russians incompetently let it catch on fire and then explode and eventually sink. Neither one is a good look for the Russian navy.
"Flagship" 40 year old Pick one
I'm sorry people died and I'm sorry there's a war but I want to laugh at the sinking of the ship.... is that wrong?
good👺😡🤬👏👍🤔😶🙃🙈🙊🙉
No big deal for russia. They can build many more soon
Weird. All while the USS The Sullivan's is taking on water today?
🤣🤣🤣
How come no one has got any pictures of it Sinking or Sunk or Damaged?
Karma
Hey Rackov I think we are sinking. Da Pisskov! Better tell Nickov and  Fuckov to abandon the sinking ship. Meanwhile back at the Krem, Vlads has secretly wandered off to a corner for a tani and a sook.
The Moscow is un ironically an analogy for Moscow right now.
That's what they get screw Russia
Fantastic news!  Now send the rest of the fleet to the bottom.
Many time we talk about”  Big Gun” Heavy look of Russia weapons!! Look scary , many missile many big gun , big radar all kind  But doses not help to be better ?? May be big look clumsy , big target  And all technology not help at all  I were said “ bad design “ and easy target ! Yes !!
i dont believe a word from Ukrainian military claims.
ดีแล้ว  เรือลำนี้แหละ  ที่ยิงขีปนาวุธใส่ยูเครน.....โดนเสียบ้างจมไปเลย.....
Why is the Pentagon saying it didn't sink and news is saying it did.?????
Oops
Ukraine will win against Russia. They ask for a no fly zone and they got it. They ask for military support one day and they got such support immediately. Sanctions has crippled the Russian economy they no longer export gas and oil to nato countries. Ukraine will I am sure. Tell me yes 👍.
Ggg
Yes strange as it may seem I can remember something that happened only yesterday.   The story that the Ukrainian Forces fired two missiles which hit the Moskva is just that, a story, a fantasy. They have presented no evidence at all of any such missile attack, and this incident is what the Russians say it is, for them an unfortunate accident. But if the Ukrainians want to call this accident a great victory, the Russians I suspect will not try to take away from them the only "victory" they are likely to have to celebrate in the coming weeks.  I do not know when the Moskva last saw action, but it is likely to have been long before the current conflict started that a missile was fired from her. The vessel was used as a Flag-ship because of its large size, an administrative and communications center for the fleet's Admiral and his staff, rather than as a fighting ship. It was as the report stated very old by naval standards. The cause of the fire was under investigation, I do not know if that cause was established before the Moskva sunk.
In Nelson's voice from the Simpsons, "HA HA".  Take that, Putin!
If this is true than this is great news for every free man and woman in the world . Slava Ukraini
they have a new  sub like there other one sat on the bottom
Acording to special military retrofit it has become a submarine, a noble transformation as planed.
God bless Ukraine please stay safe xxx
Ukraine make Russian sailors become submariners!
We're gonna need a bigger boat.
Recommissioned as the  “Snake Island Memorial Reef “🐠
Putin khuylo!
RUSSIA WILL NEVER SAY THE TRUTH. THIS IS JUSTICE OF GOD AGAINST THE 😈 EVIL
PUTIN is not acting alone, this is why he is so bold in his horrific atrocities.I believe he have secret alliances with nuclear capabilities such as N.Korea,Iran, China, Syria and God only knows who else, that have a hate for Ukraine,America, NATO,and ISRAEL and wants to wipe them off the face of the earth, and is trying to provoke America and NATO into  war by all these atrocities to Ukraine.
Ukraine should blow up the Crimea bridge, that would be a huge blow to putin
well done to the good guys helped by the Brits!
"we successfully submerged the ship to put the fire out."
In Soviet Russia, ship destroys missile.
All Russian Navy ships are also Submarines.  NOTE; ONLY WORK ONCE.
Moskva was a ship made in Nikolaev, Ukraine. Sadly it was used to strike Nikolaev and Odessa, and was sunk symbolically by Ukraine too.
hahaha
The pentagon confirms there is no evidence the ship was damaged by a missile . Fire seems to be the problem . If the ship was sunk by the Ukrainians they would have filmed it and used the footage for propaganda purposes
Prove it.
Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦
Russia was saying it needed a new submarine fleet. Ukraine simply helping them ship by ship. 🇺🇦 🇮🇪
Putin: everything is going according to plan, we are focusing the bottom of the sea. 💙💛
Thats a Good News, the Bad News is that the Crew doesn't sink with it..🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Good, it's a shame some of the invaders were able to evacuate. СЛАВА УКРАЇНІ 🇺🇦
A lot of dead Russian sailors in the Black Sea. Revenge is a b*tch! Well done Ukraine 🇺🇦
That's a damn shame. lol
FANTASTIC
Bwahahahahaha!!! Go Ukraine!!🇺🇦
"Pick on someone your own size"
Russian media: "Heroic vessel Moskva promoted to submarine"
USA seeing this Russian vessel being sunk by Ukrainian.   USA: Too weak 🤭🤭
This is a big deal; economically speaking, sinking a warship is like destroying 1000 tanks. Major accomplishment!
Hahahahahahahahaha
Another feat of derring-do by the plucky forces of the Ukrainian nation.
There was nothing 'largely symbolic' about its presence or its wartime capability. It was most certainly an integral part of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Now that it has sunk to the bottom of the Black Sea, it's now a symbol  of either the competent hands of the Ukraine military or the incompetent hands of the Russian military - or both. This attack/failure has dealt a massive blow to Putin's ego and is a  major failure on every level for Russia's military.
So long,Ivan!!!!
Good
Not the Russian flagship, this boat was commissioned in 1979. get your facts right.  Oh sorry, it's Sky news, I should have realised...
One less tool for War Criminal Putin. Great job Ukraine.
In the words of Nelson...    Nelson Muntz: Ha Ha!
*WHY DON'T WE SEE THS HIP BURNING OR DAMAGED?  THERE ARE MANY VIDEOS OF TANKS, CARS, ETC.  WHY NOT THIS HUGE ITEM TO ATTACK*
The Ukrainians didn't sink the battleship, it was just a carelessly discarded Russian cigarette.
miss isle
Oh yeah, Ukraine is winning the war, that’s why it’s in rubble and the soldiers are surrendering......
The ship is performing a “special diving operation” in the Black Sea to test it’s submergible capabilities
For those who don't know, Moskva is the the latinised spelling of the Russian word for Moscow. They just sunk a flag ship of a sleet named after their capital city. It's. Significantly it's like they just sunk the USS George Washington.
That was thoughtful of Russia to donate the new artificial reef.
Embarrassing
Verygood
This ship,followed closely by that new cocky  general and we'll see what report Putin will have for the people of Russia in May...yours very truly Alfonso Cantu USMC
It was just a flood test they deliberately sunk it to see if it would let air in..
👍👍🇺🇦🇺🇸🇺🇦❤️❤️✌️✌️

Uhh...yeah. It sunk. Glub...glub. This fills me with such joy. Now he is threatening to deploy his nukes to the border of Finland if they join NATO. His mobile nuclear weapons, to a fixed  visible position..where they can be more easily obliterated by  any average soldier with a mortar or two. I used to think there was no one more stupid than Trumph...Vlad is making me question my assessment. Finland: Don't wait. Join NATO tomorrow. There will never be a better time.
Small consolation, in the Donbass region,  ukranian troops have been surrendering by the thousands
Dont publish fake news
Good
Russia is losing everything.
Hell yeah 🫡
Just own it, Putin. Ukraine sank your rust bucket "flagship".
Nice, Russia has a new submarine
Ruck Fussia
Soviet era ship 😂😂😂
I wonder how long we will get to wait to see pudin swinging like we did with saddam
At last! A TITANIC sequel
GLORY TO UKRAINIANS AMEN 🙏🙏🙏
AHH HAAA....HAAA.....
What’s going on with the Russians. Something certainly seems amiss. I wish Victory for all of Ukraine but the Russians are loosing equipment in the Air, one theLand & at Sea. I almost can’t believe the extent of Russias’ losses considering their own opinion of being a massive fighting country. Ukrainians have to be the luckiest military in Europe.
The ship was damaged by incidental fire yet the whole Black Sea Fleet is being taken out of range of the Ukrainian Coast sure😁

Good job Ukraine! Bet that one stings!
Another walk of shame to Russia Millitary force claming they are number 2 in Millitary power in the world. 😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
That's great news !!!!!!
Flagship, not iphone or Samsung
Ha, ha, ha!
Oops 😄♥️🇺🇦
The Russians sank the cruiser to save them the embarrassment later on of having to admit that Ukraine did hit their ship. They would rather lose a flagship than be found lying.
Then there’s the nuke armed missiles on board; which is a headache for everyone because they’ll have to be salvaged eventually
Moskva goes blub. 🤣👍
"After having shown the world how badly the Russian army can perform, the Russian navy got jealous and decided they can be incompetent too."  - Admiral James Stavridis, USN

Seeing Vatniks terminally coping through all the stages of grief has once again been some of the best entertainment there is.
From state media....
It hasn’t sunk it has been towed back get your facts right
That's too bad Lmao 🤣
Looks afloat to me, more BS from the libturd media.
Hell yeah!
It's sad how everyone is hypnotized. People I talk to actually think Ukraine is winning. All I'm going to say is look at Moscow and look at Ukraine..... Who's winning?
“Specialist underwater relocation operation “
Nothing is better than good news.
Mosfu€ked
All according to plan...maybe Putins plan is to cripple his own country?
Awesome!!! Slava Ukraine ✌️
Just keep blowing up all of their helicopters, jets, ships.   Eventually somebody will fix Putin.
Justice
It hasn’t sunk!!! its conducting Special Underwater Operations
Talk about surrounding Ukrainian and surrender Ukrainian troops 😊
Embarrassment after embarrassment.
HA!! Suck it Russia!
Hahahaha Russia SUCKS! Pitiful , inept military forces
Don't believe any fake news from Russia. Believe it at your own peril
Oh! Dear! Tee hee.
Russia owns the worlds newest most expensive fish hotel.
Is it a Kirov Class cruiser..🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Couldn't consider that a counter attack from the world the civilized world
It's something similar to what the British did to the Germans early in WWII when they sank the pocket battleship Graf Spee. 🇺🇦🙏👏
Bloody well done, lads ! Слава Україні !
Hip hip hooray! Slava Ukraini! 💛💙
Missile Cruiser Moskva was successfully promoted to Submarine.  Big achievement!
Putin ordered  the old ship to be detonated as it  was ready for the scrap heap.
I love how they can't deny the loss of the ship, but are still trying to deny Ukraine sunk it!!
Poor little russians, the war is lost, the hope is lost, the president is...non arriva a mangiare il panettone. 😂😂🤡🤡
Wow look how easy Russia is, it seems the only real threat that it has is the nukes.
Now it's a symbolic absence.
😁
Well done boys. They've got the talent we will give them the tools.
Nothing to worry Russia and China will be triumph Amen 🙏 from the Messenger of God Shamsuzzaman Nasara Tarafdar.
I guess Ukrainians are really good at playing the game of Battleship 🤣🤣
The Muskav went down faster than a trump mistress in a discount jewelry store parking lot.
Yeah and he and Trump now have a private pirate shop to skin dive and explore. Putin loves photo ops without a shirt. Should be perfect.
Good
It hurts my loving heart that there's no footage of the Neptunes making sweet sweet contact with the Moskva... But I'll take the outcome!
Now all that ammo is in Davies locker, sure the environment will enjoy there new trophy
The Muskav has been redeployed as a submarine.
This ship must cost a lot of money.
Sinking of Cruiser Moskva must be serious blow to the Russian navy and it could depress morale of Russian aggressors in Ukraine. If Moskva was heavily damaged not by Ukraine`s missile attack but by a fire, it indicates safety management of Russian warships is incredibly poor.
Moskva is literally Moscow in Russian. Ukrainians can now say that they destroyed Moscow
Time for talking is el and truly over,trust me,d ti.es they are a changing
It’s so old it’s better off this way. Sorry for the crew tho. Just like battleships hit at Pearl Harbor, most of them were so old with little battle value.
The story almost like Russian submarine Kursk disaster!
Lol!!
sank ? oh my god it’s fake but somewhere of ship was fired no sank
The ship was temporarily scuttled to upgrade and install cruise nuclear missiles.
The ship is already in a Russian shipyard, the Russian commanders do not want journalists, the images I see seem to show that it is a double explosion from the ship's holds, the ship exploded due to sabotage, from within, it is an explosion from within, no it is a missile or a bombardment that hit from the outside.  I am a data analyst, I have seen dozens and dozens of military and civilian ships and oil tankers attacked from outside or exploded from within, this is an accident or sabotage, it is not a missile, I know what I am saying. This is sabotage.   Ukraine is inflicting untold casualties on Russia that cannot be counted for now.   But it is around 20% of 100 Russian battalions. Russia has 160 battalions in total. Russia is very damaged and Putin already knows it. Russia can only send new recruits or mercenaries because it needs a minimum of 60 battalions to badly defend its territory.   Corrupt Russian officials are drunk from so much money stolen from their people, their army is dry and rusty, Russians flee at first blast, Russian military vehicles are captured or destroyed standing still because they are abandoned by the Russians and are easy targets. Ukraine has more armor now than before the invasion. Russia has less occupied land in Ukraine than before the invasion.  And to top it off, everyone accepts that Putin is a genocide and nobody supports him, only those who are afraid of him support Putin.
Glory to Ukraine🇺🇦 and curse for the Evil Poutine.
And did the 39 year old vessel still play a major role in operations? Or a minor support role? The real intelligence is that the stroke was ordered from Washington as a political response to Biden approval ratings.
Welcome to the Ukrainian meat grinder !!!
There no any footage that great ship sunk? Come on...
Poor Putler. This can not be good for (what passes for) his heart. Слава Україні!
There will be some great dive sites in the Black Sea one day!
Blubb Blubb
This is all Putin's fault. Every death from this war is all on Putin's head.
Fake, total fake
Flagship of the closed bargain basement store.
Fooking hilarious.
Fake
God is at work...
Err taxi for puitin!!! Exti stage left what a total fud!!!!🤣🇺🇦🤣👍
BRAVO!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ship is now where it belongs.
Ivan says that the Moskva explosion was the result of an "accident" - not due to a Ukrainian missile strike. So the Russian Navy decided to move their ships away from the Ukraine Coast - to "prevent any future "accidents" of this type!
Finally, the rebuilding of the blacksea coral reef is underway, it's an ambitious project with many more decommissions planned in the near future. The gesture of turning swords in the midst of strife into aquatic diversity plowshares won't be forgotten. 😕
Some time the bombs can sabotage the ship.  God take care of everything and everyone. 💯
That’s not a good signal for Ukraine and it’s supporters,no more mercy from Russia.
..stormy weather...
😂 hahahaha Take that pig 🐷 Putin! hahaha 🤣
I hope many terror supporters went down with the Ship.
They should just sink all their ships and reclaim Crimea.
I'm surprised a Ukrainian farmer didn't tow the ship away.
Special Undersea operations
Specal Underwater Operations
Lol: "Ammunition went on fire"  Yeah...... how did it get on fire???
Vital victory for Ukraine such a lucky strategic target! Glad that she’s no threat any more!  Slava Ukraini! 🇺🇦
Where’s the videos of it sinking. That would be confirmation of your report.
It's going to plan according to Putin - converting the ship into a submarine in a 'special marine operations' , albeit one that's submerged forever.😂 Day by day we see providence aiding the Ukrainians.👏 Evil is bound to fail in the end.✊
I wont be surprised if the radar operators were half drunk or saw two dots approaching and instead thought it was a glitch…
Secret "Special Underwater Operation."  Russia created the first warship to submarine stealthmode conversion kit...
This is the same footage when they said f u to the Russian...this fake war is comical
Gods gift for the Holy week.... it only prove that true evil must fail
It’s time for the Ukrainian forces to go on offensive moves. Keep it up Ukraine 🇺🇦👍👏
The Moscow is a dual purpose ship, for some mission it's a surface war ship and for other missions it serves as a submarine and it is now on special submarine operations.  Congratulations to the Ukraine Military.
Special under water military operation.
やっとくたばった。
According to pandora papers zelensky has 1.6billion dollars in offshore accounts. Please take a step back and understand the reasoning behind the conflict
Ukraine: We hit Moskva and sunk.  Russia: Don't be funny, our cruiser ship is also a submarine, submerged to do a "Special Diving Operation."
Well this is a lose lose for Russia: Sunk by 2 Neptune missiles or Russias military incompetence
Scratch 1 Atlant Class Missile Cruiser attacked by  Vampire 2 say again 2 incoming Vampire secondary explosion and major fire. Suspect MC Moskva reported capsize and sunk . Standby on guard channel 455.020 go Crystal Palace for tasking. Over n out monitor.....
Maybe the Russians should keep ALL their ships underwater to prevent them from bursting into flames?
I am happy Ukrainian missiles nullified the biggest Russian ship which has been killing Ukrainian civilians for weeks. That ship deserved it. I hope more Neptune missiles can wipe out the Russian fleet from the Black Sea altogether.
Russian seems to be approaching this war with a playbook written 1944. Long and unsupplied convoys, forces spread too thin in other areas to be effective, inability to hold key targets, poor recon and intel... good grief.
Each one of these events pushes Putin a little further into a corner.  Eventually he's going to bite, like the rabid animal he is.  I'm amazed he's not launched nukes already...
I don't know why but I picture the Ukrainians sinking the ship with spud guns lol
Mokva :-))
Lots of jokes here. Dont forget the laughter.
Good job ukraine 🇺🇦 job well done
🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🤜🤛💪💪
Watch the water on rumble wold premier
Sink em, sink em, sink em!
One for the good guys! No more shelling of Ukraine from the Russian flagship Moskva.
Good good nice
Rosyjska flota na dno
promoted to submarine
"Cruise Ship"???🤣🤣🤣
i knew these thing would sink, even before the war broke out
Uke's bleed and die for the West/Nato. It's a pivotal moment in World history.  Democracies must step up and send Uke's the best jets,  tanks,  missiles,  materiel and training:     End game is...1991 borders and back to Hell with Trump and Putin's Neo- Holodomoric Devils.   Slava Mother Ukraine 🇺🇦🇨🇦!!
The Moskva is now conducting special underseas operations.
Russia would rather claim that their incompetence sank the ship then admit any success to the Ukrainians  -- crazies top to bottom.
One lie after another. Solid propaganda on both sides. Just fire the nukes already
Putin 'How could this happen?'....playin' with the Big Boys!
OH MY!  40 whole years old.  Good grief.
Good get it fuckn round ya ruskie bams!!!!🤣🤣🤣🇺🇦👍
The Pentagon cant verify Ukrainians claims. Ukraine also lied in the past about sinking a Russian ship. The ghost of Kiev and so much more CIA made of propaganda.
Lol oh snap! They can’t be happy with that!
Russia s  sink more of their own ships than  any enemy can ,.
The old joke returns:- What was the last thing the captain of the Moskva said?  What does this red button do!
Karma is so sweet
Things to see, Places to visit for  Sponge Bob
At least the fire is contained! 😂😂😂
*Evidence that the Ukraine military is way more effective than Russia's: look at all of the damage Ukraine is doing to Russia's military; and all without attacking a single Russian civilian!* *Meanwhile, Russia's military is murdering thousands of innocent Ukrainian civilians, and it still seems like Russia is getting their a$$ kicked!* *Russia's military has no honor! Russia's military leaders are so god damn stupid that they do not even realize that all of their attacks on civilians are making the Ukrainians fight even harder!* *SLAVA UKRAINE!*
Conveniently sunk to hide evidence of battle damage possibly? Their narrative of an engineering casualty or explosive incident can now stand unchallenged.
Every human life lost is irretrievable, nothing to celebrate.  Extremist nationalisms swarm in Europe.  They already caused two world wars in the SXX.  Now they go for the third.  In terms of material losses, the gas and oil that Europe imports pay for 10 of these ships.  All an absurdity.  We just have to celebrate the ceasefire and peace
be God with Ukraine!
Bravo
Battleship Moscow 0, Chicken Kiev 1
State media reports a Russian warship was sunk today after being struck by two oversized fire-breathing alien peni.
Dom all around!
Lol
good ... more garbage in the botton of the ocean
Doesn't say much for the Russian Navy's  damage control.
The British sank the General Belgrano using torpedoes from a submarine.  It was an old ship.  It was full of young soldiers.  323 human beings died. Nothing to celebrate. Every human life lost is irretrievable, nothing to celebrate.  Extremist nationalisms swarm in Europe.  They already caused two world wars in the SXX.  Now they go for the third.  In terms of material losses, the gas and oil that Europe imports for 10 of these ships.  All an absurdity.  We just have to celebrate the ceasefire and peace
Ukraine used a drone to distract Russia...so ship would track this drone, and then Ukraine  fired two guided missiles (which they developed and made themselves...just reasently released last year), striking the ship. Amo on the ship blew up, further damaging the ship. Out of 500 crew, about 50ish was rescued, as the see was really rought due to the storm and they only pulled those in the water.  This ship is the most advanced ship in Russian fleet, used to pack many ballistic missiles which could reach US. Also used as command center in Black sea.
идти на хуй русский корабль Remember snake island? Will there be representation in the 9th May victory day parade?
Going to make a beautiful reef, I hope they add to it
It did not sink, it turned into an underwater crawler
More of Russias money pissed down the drain. A beautiful thing
this is the military our own  US Government has been terrified of for decades what a shame we havent taken a putin to task before cant believe it
I hope it is not the only ship that is demilitarized keep it up Ukraine I can do it
Sinks ?????/?/😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 all news are so full of manure!
Huge moral hit for the Russians! This shows that their ships aren’t invincible like they sell them to be lol
Sank? I just saw it being towed back to pier
So was it sunk or towed back to port? She said both a few times.
Hahhaha😂😂😂😂
I suppose they had to admit it had sunk. A bit hard to deny when it is under water
The Brave Russians were only in the Ukraine for a goodwill mission.  Clearly the Ukrainians are trying to blow up Russia.  Putin's propaganda couldn't convince a 5-year old; Putin doesn't care - he wants to do mass-murder and eat up Europe.  Our fearless leader (Biden) is a total loser.
Putin announces his plans in the black sea have been completed, he moves his ships to the south and phase 2 starts....
Good now sink all of the USSR ships that are involved
hhjh
slava ukraini 🎉🎉😂😂😂
😂😂
Russian navy are shiddhedds
Positive news. Slava Ukraini
We really weren’t trying to take Kyiv and we really thought that this ship was better served as an artificial reef.  Everything is going exactly as planned. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
Russia will win the war, stop Western propaganda
#SlavaUkraine
Good news for Ukraine
Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦 Great job!
Gee , that’s to bad !  Another paper tiger bites the dust …  erm bottom !
GOOD JOB FREE UKRAINE 🇺🇦
Russia putin ism will go down in hell along with chinas xi ism,  Americas trumpism , N.K. Kim ism and all the other evil dictators.
Ukraine didn't sink it our incompetent sailors did.
I did not sink , it had fire though . Sky tv is a fake news channel.
lol, I love the russian excuses.  Russia is essentially saying they are so incompetent that they sunk their own ship.... better to say the ukrainians did it.
The same thing happened to the British when they underestimated the Argentines in the Falklands.  The HMS Sheffield ended up sunk.
This Ship do crime to ukraine, it should be destroy.  Putin crime .
Revenge for the destruction of the Antonov AN 225 UKraine  Fight Hard💪💪💪💪💪🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤣🤣🤣🤣
Here is a translation of Ukrainian national anthem. A 500 years old words tell it all that this nation is all about...  The glory and freedom of Ukraine have not yet perished  Luck will still smile on us brother-Ukrainians.  Our enemies will die, as the dew does in the sunshine,  and we, too, brothers, we'll live happily in our land.  We’ll not spare either our souls or bodies to get freedom  and we’ll prove that we brothers are of Kozak kin...  ...  Slava Ukraine
Will we be able to see Lavrov or Peskov admitting that the warship Moskva has been sunk by enemy action?
a ship full of explosives and gasoline...what could go wrong....
Russia a world superpower?????? I THINK NOT!!!
News : A comet is passing by near earth.  Ukraine : We did that....
Ok. Does this mean the Moskva will NOT take part in the upcoming Mayday parade in Moscow?? 🇺🇦🇺🇦
Strange there is no video footage or pictures. Maybe it was not Ukraine.
Arrrrr.... swim with yer brothers the fishes...arrrrr
HELL YES!!!! 😁😁😁
FABULOUS 🤔
Yes, the ammunition did set on fire.....after it was hit with missiles.
Did it sink in a fortuitously deep part of the Black Sea where its unlikely to be photographed with 2 anti ship missile shaped holes in its hull ? Probably why it 'didn't make it to port'. Not that I don't believe every single excuse Russia comes up with...
Flagship "Bubbles" Captain Crab Commanding
The second of many. The Russian Navy will soon find the fate of her Ships the same as the fate of its tanks.
BLUB BLUB POOOTIN
Haha sure stormy weather 🤣 😆 😜
It was not sunk, it is conducting a special submerging operation.
That's nice of the Russians to donate their flagship for an artificial reef!!! I hope the fish really enjoy it. 🐟🐟🐳🐙
Ukraine 🇺🇦
Conducting a special naval operation  - under the sea.
Good
Fabulous news! Well done Ukraine. Shame on Russia
Now it’s a ‘great presence’ on the bottom of the Black Sea.
Did the Ukraine sink it, or damage it…..
It was 40 years old
HAAAAAAAAAAAA😅😅😅😅.    Russia sunk their own ship - according to them!😂
Ammunition fire? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦
Are they that advance as advertise?or just being overrated army..Whats happening with them..This is humiliating for them..People around the will know how weak they are..Because of The Ukraininans will power and the countries who are helping defeat this Communist tyrant. This countries are much more superior in maybe a 2 decades gap of tactics, strategy,morale and equipments.
All these propaganda news from Russia,Ukraine I am just tired of listening them ,I wish this war ends soon and NATO cooperates instead of supplying weapons and making it more destructive.
Post the drone footage - we don't need stills of a warship.
Whatever story the Russians want to come up with. May they have a lot of ammunition failure etc whatever
🇺🇦
flagship?!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 this gets better and better as weeks go on they're military hardware is junk
Oh gosh how embarrassing… I’m glad I’m not Russian!! 😬
❤❤❤
I follow the Moskva... to the bottom of the Black Sea... listening to the wind of change
Russians deny it was a missile strike. Instead they demand everyone know they blew it up themselves because they are completely stupid
Correction: it WAS the flagship of the fleet. Slava Ukrania!
Lololo
Ukraine: we destroyed your ship! Russia: we destroyed your entire country!
The Russian Defense Ministry has announced its flagship vessel Moskva has successfully completed its mission off the coast of Ukraine and is now focusing on neutralizing potential enemy targets hiding at the bottom of the Black Sea.
I heard it hit a ice berg ... compromised five watertight compartments
Good to hear destroy their entire military
After 10 years service in the United States Navy, for the life of me, I have never heard of a sunken ship being towed back to port.  I am laughing my head off!  This is a typical propaganda main stream media news report.
In related news, President Joe Biden reports that he hasn't lost his marbles.. it's just that they've been strategically disguised and relocated into his underwear.
Good.
Great news.
I'm sorry Pig 🐖 Putin and his family and friends were not on it... peace on earth 🌎.
spontaneous combustion according to the kremlin, unless russian sailors are seriously bad i would say likely Ukraine missile attack, great result. Slava Ukraine
hahahahahahaha, this war of Putin and Russia is more and more becoming a comedy rapidly!
This is getting down right comical, is there anything about the Russian military that is not just pure crap?
Great!
Ha ha. No nukes in retaliation, please. Some reports have stated that this ship typically has a crew of 500 sailors. Is that possible? Naval experienced personnel, please comment.
We need to rid the earth of China and Russia. Nothing good will ever come from Russia. The old China is gone forever.
They fired the missiles for sure. What are the odds the ship happened to catch fire the same time the Ukrainians fired their anti ship missiles. I’m almost certain it was a successful attack.
Hahahahaha 😂 😂 😂 😂
Long live Russia, long live Putin, long live SoViet
Russina Flag Ship - Ace of Base song lyrics - "I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes. I saw the sign" Isn't this proof enough that Russia is never gonna win this.
good, I'm glad it sank. lol.
Much like Putin's plan for taking over Ukraine, it has sunk.
Likely this ship had the c and C on board, and nukes and crypto.
Mfw Russia would rather people believe their pride and joy sunk in accident instead of KIA
Wondering how the farmers will tow it back on shore now that it has sunk?
I hope that I die so much
Glory to Ukraine!!!
If Putin really was a genius, he never would have screwed himself and his military's image the way he has.    Now, he's screwed. Unfortunately, so is the average Russian citizen - for a long time to come.  Pretty messed up. Putin just doesn't gaf.  A damned shame...!
Brace yourself the troll will be reaching into his attaché case cause he’s really pissed now!  Let’s see what the next threat will be?
Any pictures of the sinking...this could be a distraction and a lie from Moscow.
Argentina now doesn’t have the biggest naval  L since WW2
Scratch one destroyer! No problem. Glad will just send a couple of aircraft carriers into the fray, oh wait. The Russian military doesn't have any mission capable carriers!  It seems that even the nuclear powered stuff still needs a lot of maintenance and constant upgrades!   I hope that the Ukrainian military roasts the Russian army.
nice...
Putin will death sooner or later, Never surender Ukraine teritorial integrity even in an inch! Guerilla Salut! Slava Ukraine!
"It had a fire". Total coincidence
It did not sink.  It was a "special titanic operation."
Sink more
As the key member of the old USSR,   Russia prospered whilst reaping all the cream off those captive nations. The sinking of the Mosckva is symbolic of Russia's demise if it continues to try and re-take control of Ukraine and restore it's former glory. It would be best advised to forget Dugin's visions, withdraw its forces while it can and be content in itself.
Naval strategy, around the world has  just changed. Land based anti ship systems are the new in thing.
Glory to GOD and there will be more sinked Russian ships in our Territory, I mean at Ukraine!
Y E S !!   S C O R E!!  Ukraine earned a dozen bonus points on that one!
Hahaha
God Bless the Ukrainian people.
ROFLMAO!  Slava Ukraine!
I would tend to believe that an accident occured while handling munitions resulting in the loss of the ship. These things happen from time to time on warships, no matter what nation owns them. This has happened on American ships in the past. Even though they are the enemy, I hope the loss of life was minimal.
It was just putting on it’s submarine disguise
They sunk my battleship
NATO VICTORY
Different of war: https://youtu.be/Hjz_YIvlCw8
According to Putin, it hasn't sunk, it's simply gone on a "Special Underwater Operation"
oh dear how sad never mind
Again another fake News 👏🏽
Yaaaaaa!
It must be terrible being a young man in russia.I can't believe 83% of russians like Putin.But why?
Admit that Ukraine sunk your little boat or that inept crew were manning a poorly designed and constructed vessel.  Pick one, Vlad.
🤣 Clown shoes
W
fake news
More from a US SUBMARINE
Russia said it was a fire in the interior room where the weapons are kept, they sent it to get a coat of paint, that's all.
Limped  out of port then scuttled at a safe distance.
They didn’t send a drone to distract. They sent it out to take out any fire control radar, so the heavy missile could penetrate their AAW defenses.
[..Prof. Farnsworth..]: "..Good news everyone!.."
It was at this point, that Putin decided the Moskva would make a fantastic artificial reef.
Ha, ha, ha…..so much for quality built!
The ship was on a special military maintenance at the Seabed, it didn't sink...🤣🤣🤣
bad news
Its not merely symbolic.
Flagship has *not* sunk. It is on a 'special operation' at the bottom of the Black Sea.
thats great news. well done ukraine. 👍👏👏
Nice keep up the good work Ukraine. Send them to the bottom of the ocean
ukrainian sailors need to tow it away now
Brag for three days over one ship
LMAO what an embarrassment!!!
Russian warship sunk itself 😁😁😁
A stick accidentally fired in the hands of a Ukrainian military man, as a result of which a fire broke out, in fact, the ship was full of sunflower seeds, and had no military significance.
Great News!!! Слава Україні!!!
So was this a special underwater operation?
El que amenaza..que se atenga a las consecuencias.. nosotros ya tenemos preparados todos los misiles balísticos.. el que golpea primero.. golpea dos veces..  Tiene miedo y le sobran razones y enemigos que se ha ganado a pulso.. El que siembra viento.. Recogerá tempestades.. 💪🇪🇺🇺🇸🇺🇦💪 💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣 💥🔥🐁☠⚰💩🇷🇺💩⚰☠🐁🔥💥
WOMP
Slava Ukraini!
We deny ship has sunk. It’s a special submerging operation.
Dosvidaniya Moskva.
The Sun tried claiming it was hit by a hypersonic missile.
Evidently having your ammo blow up makes your Fleet to go south.
Hey Guys :) , I made a video on the recent military strategic developments in the Russian Ukraine Conflict, as per the Institute for the Study of War. Please do let me know your thoughts :)). Link https://youtu.be/D_DaA5UBP1I
🇺🇦💪
Sky News employees are wearing Black Armbands over this.
I would believe Ukraine before I believe anything Russia says
SPECIAL SUBMARINE OPERATIONS  IN THE BLACK SEA...
Even god is backing them up.
The American said it's still sailing tf!
Amazing so much news & no photos or videos...one country say sunk others say BS......
God bless the wonderful country of Ukraine and its superb armed forces!
Yipeee! Well done! And without a battleship of their own.
That's hilarious 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is what happens when a ship doesn't have a cope cage.
They still have some yachts hiding maybe those can fight their war ....
Haha. Fools it is all a part of putlers masterplan.... said some trolls
Two positive news from the Russian media: 1. The fire on the cruiser Moscow was successfully extinguished 2. Russia will save money on servicing and maintaining the cruiser Conclusion: this is a big strategic victory
Russia, or should I say Putin is trying to totally destroy Ukraine, and then carries on when Ukraine retaliate.  What did he expect? That Ukrainians would just stand back and say ‘Here take our country’.  Stay strong Ukraine👏👏❤️
Oh man, ship went straight to Bikini Bottom
Everytime I hear of Russian tanks getting blown up or aircraft being shot down it makes me so happy. Watching Russian forces get ruined is everything they deserve. Fingers crossed more ships get sunk real soon.
0:14, that's the most aggressive looking "Cruise Ship" I've ever seen!
Pride of Mudda Russia, special operations Tub Toy, in Black Sea bottom storage. Ukrainian farmers scuba team currently enroute with amphibious tractors for retrieval . SLAVA UKRAINE. 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
The flagship sinking is one thing but the morale damage to their russian navy is the real deal. I sincerely hope their new general aleksandr can be taken out too which can completely crippled their invasion force.
At last something good happens.
We're is the Ukrainian drone footage
I wonder how many sailors drowned in the ocean? What a scary way to go.
God punishes Russia’s Vladimir Putin is sinking his warship into the Black Sea that he is a evil dictator has malicious mind.
lol
I call this one a total propaganda BS from Ukraine. If it was true they would have showed the video of them launching the missiles and these striking the vessel, so... No it did not happen the way the Ukrainians are claiming. Unless they show the video proof, the Ukrainians have the burden of proof.
Now with Ukraine just acquiring a brand new load of Harpoon Missiles from Allies, let's see them, Load, Wash and Repeat many more times!
yes drones ships with missles  what could go wrong?
The sea life is happy. They can use it as an artificial reef
How sad.
I don't believe anything the Russians say. When they say the the ship was damaged by accident, more likely it was caused by Ukraine attack. When they say the ship sank, it is more likely that: the ship has tuned on its invisibility cloak, the ship switched to submarine mode, the ship converts to a spaceship and attacked US satellites, the ship was hijacked by Somalians, More possible scenario than Russians actually telling the truth.
Cute now what
Oh look some more "ukraine is winning" lies.
There's no way that all 500 on board escaped harm from the explosions. And that's what I call a good start. Hope they sink every Russian ship in the bkack sea. Some justice for the AN225.
Well it seems the Moskva did exactly what the guy on Snake Island asked it to.  Good riddance.  SLAVA UKRAINI
Russian warship: "Go f#ck yourself."
Fantastic! Slava Ukraini!!
What wonderful news . A stick in Putins eye .
Another blow to Putin
Moskva has just been reassigned to the "special operation" as a submarine.
Whoops! Ópa!
😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
Score one for the good guys!!! Slava Ukraini🇺🇦❤️🇺🇸❤️
Russia sucks.
Slava Ukraini
good, love it
CIA reported it's not sunk.
Putin must be stopped as he will continue the massacre seeing he has now nothing to loose as the world knows he is guilty of war crimes !!!!!!!!!
Only one ship?
i wonder if any admiral died in the attack, time to move the black sea fleet far from the coast of ukraine. Love the failure of Russian defense systems. lousy army, and a horrible navy. many more Russians to die for Putin the war criminal. im sure this ship shot at civilians so im glad it sunk...hopefully with lots to the crew.
Next stop Putins House. 🏡
Finally he is sunk. I believe she hit a mine.🤔🕵️👍.
Hell yeah! To hell with Russia!
Russia said today "the sinking of the Movska was the result of a fire on board". They insisted "the direct-hit missile strike had absolutely nothing to do with it." When Russian reporters asked what about the missile? the Defense Minster replied "we tried to pull it it but it was in there pretty tight."
I see a war in which it is possible for 2 men in a small boat take out fleets of ships   one by one would it not also deter China?
Another page added to "Great Russian Naval Victories"
Special ops.
Human's never learn
All the attention to the ship..no one talks about Mariupol…they think we are idiots 😅 ….if these ppl talk about african /syrian/ afghn wars like this…its gonna be all day news😲..but why they are not white?? Right?? And that’s exactly why I don’t support these ppl..from 🇯🇵
THIS JUST IN:  Moskva promoted to submarine!
Less Orcs makes for a better world
Weak Russia
It didn't sink.  It is engaging in a special military operation to de-nazify the floor of the Black Sea.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏😹😂🤣😅🤭😃😁😊😜😜😜😜😜😜🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Losing a flag ship in and of itself is huge. She's undergone significant upgrades since being commissioned. But losing a cruiser is incalculable. A massive ship at 12,500 tonnes, and with a very long history while also being present at significant moments in history. Where is the video footage I wonder? Normally Ukrainians post big hits asap.
For everyone fretting about the Murdoch propaganda machine taking over the earth: The first time she says the name of the ship, she calls it the “MOCBA”, which is indeed how you’d pronounce its name in Cyrillic characters if they were Latin ones. The second (and subsequent) times she pronounces it correctly, but then calls it a “missile cruise ship”. I think we’re safe.
President Biden please get the weapons to Ukraine that they need. May they continue to fight with courage and hold Putin back.
meow
This a lie! It didn't sink! It was just an explosion but the ship didn't sink.
JorgeIII.   Putin, Top Russian Naval Military Leaders and Madam must have had Joe Biden put his son Hunter in charge of Russian Naval operations!!!
Funny part is that ships like this were built during time of the USSR...in the Ukrainian shipyards.  Russia has no way to replace it.
No it didn't sunk, but a special unscheduled submarine conversion was conducted.
According to the Special Operation Plans, the recovery objective was mostly successful.
Putin just announced that the warship is transvessel and now identifies as a submarine
Good.
Nothing to see here just special training exercises, right?
Hmmm..... no there is no evidence of the specific damage to the ship or what caused it. Planned?
Russia sucks.
Russia will claim, that it was “The Samovar” in the galley,that caused the fire :D
Слава непобедимой Украине!!! ✌🇺🇦🔱✊♥ Слава непобедимой Украине!!! ✌🇺🇦🔱✊♥ Слава непобедимой Украине!!! ✌🇺🇦🔱✊♥
no footage of it going down   never can believe the news   and probably never will again with the way is so out right lies about everything.  no different then Russia or china.  all lies
I'm not convinced that its sunk unless I see it myself
"Oh it just had a random fire and sunk, sure its been in service 40 years.... and 40 days into a war, it sinks by accident".... SUUUURE...  Any russians who still believe the Kremlin, need to have a serious talk with themselves.
At least the fires are out🤷‍♂️
Due to the 'fog of war' it could have  factually been sabotage!🤔
ammo fire from missile hits.
YES!! It sunk ! If it did then God bless Ukraine! This ship killed 1,000’s of Ukrainian’s and yes the ammunition’s exploded because the Ukrainian Neptune missiles hIt it Yes keep up the good work Ukraine!
Sad
Good ! Sink all of them . Evil is exactly that . Putler is evil !
this could be a mistake by the yanks in ukraine
لقد غرقت! هذا عظيم!
Psa 48:7  Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.
They are just an international laughing stock, I bet they are all pissed all the time. WE will conquor the Ukraine in a matter of hours with our Vodka fuelled army.
Russians: "according to the plan of special operation "
Hearing?  Get some bloody video!  How hard is it to get footage?  We have satellites scrutinizing that country all day long.
Russians are crafty, they have ships that turn into submarines.
Kinda stupid of these Russians to not have anti missile defenses on their beloved flagship, not even the scorts
It didnt sink, it conducted a Special Submersible Operation.
So Ukraine is claiming the shot a missle at a vessel yup that's all out war to me
Putin is a war criminal and needs to be charged as such
Spit on a russian day
I wonder how long it will be before we see this thing sitting in a farm in Western Ukraine lol
This is just the Omen of what will happen to Russia. Russia WILL sink and will NEVER recover from this.
Good!
They Say The Last Kicks Of a Dieing Horse....This are Prayers of all over The World Plus those who were killed Haunting Russia.Slava Ukraini🇺🇦🇺🇦
The glorification of murder is sickening
One down more to come.
It's not a sinking: It's a "special undersea operation".
Not a good sign when your flagship, named after your capitol, sinks.
Russia needs to cut its losses before they learn the hardest lesson in their history.
Hahahahahaha
I hope it took a bunch of Russian sailors with it to Davy Jones' Locker.
The Russian navy has never exactly been a strong point of their defense.  The Cold War produced some truly terrifying vessels but at the same time they were never tested so who knows how capable they truly were.
If Russia say anything just say its a special operation don't worry lol this makes me smile I won't to see putins face, celebrate that on the 9th of May, glory to Ukraine
A fine job by Uncle Vlads Navy!  Extra Beets for all hands still on board!  LMMAO...
Why did Russian government tell about this. Usally they don't like to talk about military, specially if they have lost something
This is fantastic news! SLAVA UKRAINI
How many times does this woman repeat herself??
Dear Vlad... send more flag ships.
If it sunk there would be video. Everyone has cell phones today. Just rumors here.
One down. Three to go.  🙏🇺🇦❤
But Putin is not blinking, it’s all going to plan…. 🤡
2022 version of "David and Goliath !
Слава Україні! 🇺🇦
The good news is that Moskva is still a symbol. It is just a different kind of symbol now.
I LOVE UKRAINIAN BRAVE NATION  ❤❣💟🌹🌺🌷❤❣💟🌹🌺🌷❤💟❤💟🌹🌷🌹❤ LOVE from Quetta PAKISTAN  ❤❣💟🌹🌺🌷❤❣🌹🌹🌺🌷❣💟🌹🌹🌺🌺❤❣🌺
People often imagine the environment as a colosseum. The environment chooses those who suit them, not the strong. It is the weak (the simple-minded) who suit their environment (and become part of the war machine). War is not that great at all. In order to adapt to the various war machines and try to be part of them, people are losing the ability to remain independent (especially to think independently) and their talents are diminishing generation after generation. War does not make us better.
The ole "look at the drone to the right while we send 2 Neptune missles right down the middle" trick.
F Putin!
Love this.  Good work Soldiers 👏 🙏🇺🇦💙💛💔
Putin makes his own coral reef!!! Impressive!!
British Brimstone, or Harpoon, under the guise of a Ukraine Neptune. This is fact.
Will the sinking of the Moskva on April 14th is a bit of a coincidence Because that was the very day the RMS Titanic struck the iceberg on April 14th 1912 & sank 4 hours later in
The greatest irony of all regarding this incident is that the country that designed and built the russian black sea fleet flagship along with it's sister ships was none other than UKRAINE back in the 80s when is was still a soviet republic lol. That's why they were able to exploit a weakness that any another country might not have immediately recognized to successfully strike the Moskva.
How to towed back to port when sunk
Not sunk.... It's on a special underwater operation.
The Black Sea flagship was christened to be a submarine for Putin's special underwater operation.
It’s performing a special underwater operation
Brilliant news,  hopefully a few less Rapists in the world .
Don't make a damn how it sank! IT SANK! LOVE IT
Russia checks off another box on the list of objectives.......Phase 2 ....complete denazification of Russian flag ship was 100% success comrade....
Joined the Russian submarines black sea fleet.
750 MILLION dollars sitting on the bottom of the Black Sea  🤣  👏 👏 👏
Ukraine : We sank your damn ship! Vlad: We sank our OWN damn ship!
Isn't Moskva a class of missile destroyer?
It on Ukraine stamp such a proud remembrance
Glory to Russia!
Russia is going to loose everything in that war.
beeing afloat was just a clever decoy
More egg on Putin's rat like face.  (The eggs being cheap rotting caviar of course).
The original Moskva (Russian: Москва́) was one of six Leningrad-class destroyer leaders built for the Soviet Navy during the 1930s. It was completed in 1938 and assigned to the Black Sea Fleet.  She participated in the Raid on Constanța.  On 26 June 1941, a few days after the beginning of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, she struck a mine and was sunk. The guided missile cruiser Moskva was launched as the Slava on 1979.  She was re-fitted and re-commissioned as the Moskov in 2000.  The two "Moskov's" are now less than 100 miles apart, on the seabed of the Black Sea.
GREAT NEWS!; well done Ukraine.
Russia will never be able to wash it's bloody hands, we will always know Russia as a terrorist country and will always remind to our future generations. We will also tell our future generations how brave the Ukrainians are 🇺🇦❤️🙏🏼
The ship that started the war on Snake island has “ F**ked Off “
The official line from the Russians is that there was an unknown fire on the ship... so the response to an "unknown fire" is to order all the rest of the ships out of the area... something is fishy !
This is only, special military sinking ship operations(in Russian accent)
Some of the comments  ... I don't know what to say ... oh people ... say the darnedest things ... makes for a good chuckle ...
Rush moscow
The newest Russian ships will feature glass bottomed hulls...so the crew can see the older Russian ships.
another environmental disaster as a result of anti -social human control behaviors.
It has sank 3 TIMES
Russian news: "Russian warship successfully converted into a submarine with Ukrainian cooperation!" 🤣
Deserved. Well done Ukraine. 🤣🤣🤣
so people laugh and think ,this is funny!i feel for the people ,on the receiving end ,of there facist retaliation now.putins very quiet tonight,is he planning a chemical,or nuc attack now.i feel for the ukraine,and its neighbours,no talks now,massive escalation!plus the enviromental damage this ship will now cause,this ship shouldnt be left there.if it is actually sunk!war screws everything up!just remember putin is unhinged!no laughing matter,if WW3  starts!  ukraines ,
The way they did this is fascinating. Apparently they flew a tiny drone up close enough to draw the ship's attention. "Here's the birdy. Here's the birdy!" While that was hypnotizing them....
lovly news thanks
WELL, LET'S HOPE NOT TO MANY OF THE YOUNG BOYS ONBOARD WERE KILLED!!!
Boem boem, Blub Blub Blub blub blub прощай, могила моряка, где ей место Sweet revenge for the Heroes on Snake Island! Slava Neptune!
I like to think Sverige launched a salvo of torpedoes from one of there stealthy subs. They bested a U.S. Carrier group in an exercise.
It didn't sink, it has gone into an underwater special operation.
Always wonder about surface ships and being obvious " sitting ducks". Especially with modern drones which could be launched from a sailboat or any other craft. How bout a Columbian drug smuggling sub , we've probably confiscated 100 of those.
Byeeeeee. Less missiles hitting poor little Ukraine
This means nothing for the Russians, just a bit of embarrassment.. but for NATO weapon manufacturers it means everything... they can keep the propaganda going that Ukraine has a chance to win meaning the politcians can easily continue to trick dumb citizens that more of their money should go towards bombs
Good.
Sounds like sky believes the Russian human violators more.
Great work, Ukraine! SLAVA UKRAINI 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🙏🙏🙏
Putin heard Stalin got involved with hydra and they made a few adamantium ships on the low low and he was just testing that one.  Hes allso working on having his soul(lol) swapped into the body of a redheaded doll that wears bibbed overalls and a long sleeved lgbtq pride shirt. Unfortunately no one in the free world who speaks russian and french cajun will translate that chucky curse for him.(ahwey duie dimbella")  Because itd obviously have to be said in russian to work on a russian guy....for the sake if this joke anyways. lol   Putin sux
It did not sink, it took on a special dive mission during which it will liberate many fish and undersea mammals, in accordance with established goals that were previously planned.
The kind Russians were trying to avoid hitting a goldfish and that's what caused the accident
Putin: The Moskva has not been sunk. It's engaged in a special subversive operation.
🙂
What is even worse is Russian submarines have screen doors.
Wrong, it’s not sunk. It’s performing Special Submarine Operations to de-Nazify Sponge Bob Square Pants
When ships were made of wood, men were made of iron 🦾⚔ ... And the Russians make ships out of paper and crews out of mashed potatoes! While Ukrainian farmers harvest tanks and infantry fighting vehicles! 🏳🏳🏳Something is going terribly wrong I think... 👀❓❓❓
Russian news: "Russian warship successfully destroys two Ukrainian missiles!!" 😂👍
“missile cruise ship” does she know what she’s even talking about
Oh no.. So what is everyone having for dinner?
I believe the Russian claim that the ship burned due to a fire, and sank due to a storm, about as much as I believed Putin when he said he would not invade Ukraine! If Putin says it, count on it being a lie.
Undoubtedly according to Russia a successful Special Scuttle Operation. May we see more successful SSO's to come?
Citadel Hit
What about its nuclear missiles?
"like a submarine, Mr. Wayne, like a submarine”
A new tourist diving spot?
🇺🇦✌️Looks like there is no end to the humiliation that is in store for vp 😊😊
That's going to make Putin's hair fall out more haha
invaders get what they deserve.🚀
What I fear now is the retaliation that Russia is gonna unleash on Odessa after that sinking.
hahaha
Why is that a big deal? It's a war, is that not normal.
It makes sense that Ukraine knew the weak spots of the ship. After all, the Moskva was MADE IN UKRAINE in 1979.
Inshallah ukraine will lose
Good, great to hear that,
Oh this is horrible
I'm not sure what's worse for the Russians:  The Moskva being sunk by a Ukrainian attack or just blowing up and sinking on its own.  Neither reflects well on the Black Sea Fleet.
More   scrap  metal  donation  to  Ukraine.
Hey Putin build me a new Frigate...$Cha-Ching$... $Cha-Ching.!! Better keep pumping that oil dead head...!
Great news 🙏👏👍💪
People believe this even though there's no pictures or video of it. I have yet seen proof of such statements.
russian impire sunk Impire of  mongols mentality
Was the flagship
One more Moscow to go!
Lie propganda
Thanks for pissing off the Russians,  now just much more Ukrainians will die for their leader elinski. 😁👍
SLAVA RUSSIA! SLAVA!
That 'sinking feeling,' must surely be felt now by Pukin 🤮
ok ok where do we see it on fire or sinking or what ever
Hey Russia... are ya winning? . .. ... Lemme guess, "Is Potato."
Russia =the ship didn't sink, it was our new ship/sub hybrid on a test run.
I STAND WITH UKRAIN 100%❤❤
Now THIS is reporting. Nice job.
Hahahahaha!!!! Imagine how utterly enraged Putin must be!!!
Let’s hope they sink a lot more
Hmmmm pics dont seem like it's too sunk to me
With each passing day we are seeing the collapse of the assumed might of Russia, the worry is that Putin's only option to save face is to launch a nuclear strike, as he said "the world isn't worth being in without Russia"
💙 G-D BLESS UKRAINE!💛 An American Jew.
Someday, soon, someone with a underwater camera will take a look at just what happened to that ship and we'll all get to see a big hole in it. Sorry Russia, 21st Century and all.
Would it be too much to ask for the tow boats to be pulled to the bottom too?
Slava Ukraine. May God and his angels continue to strengthen your spirit.
Lul
LMAO
Slava Ukraini!  🇺🇦
Bem que fez Ucrânia se fosse eu fazia pior
Unfortunately in this war I quite often have to concede it's not on video it didn't happen just too much propaganda.
Russian warships becoming coral reefs and Russian soldiers becoming fertiliser. 🌻
If Russia can't even take out Ukraine WTH has the states even been worried about.
Orcs don't make good sailors.
False, not sink!! 1000% 😂 Skynews, not again fake news.
So, either the Ukrainians took out the ship with advanced NATO supplied surface to sea missile technology which the Russians deny. Or the Russian Navy is so incompetent that they blew up their own ship while at sea. Or Russian ship building technology is so poor that the damn thing blew up by itself. All of the above make the Russians look like bumbling idiots. Pretty sure one of the first lessons learned at Annapolis is DON'T BLOW UP YOUR OWN FLAGSHIP. Also, we all know from the Iraqi war that attack missiles wouldn't get within 10 miles of a US or NATO ship before it was blown out of the sky and a counter strike would follow the trajectory of the attacking missile back to where it came from blowing that launch system straight to hell. We now know why Putin is terrified that Ukraine and now possibly Sweden and Finland would  join NATO. With the exception of his nukes he has no technological chance against NATO what so ever..
Great job
But is there proof it sunk I hope it has
Bad luck.  next.
Lots of propaganda on all sides. Don't believe anyone.
Is there any proof it's sunk, or are we chooseing to take Russian media's word for it today?
Snake Island strikes back.
Another one bites the Dust
I bet usa sunk it
😆 🤣 😂
Accident happen fake news and Zelensky comedian like to make propaganda cause he is desperate cause his army been beaten badly by Russian and every day Ukraine army surrendering in Mariupol what comedian Zelensky left fake media and he knows his days are coming closer too and Neocon are leaving him soon too cause neocon are getting broke too
🥳🥳🥳🥳
Putin reports the flag ship is now working undercover.  Get it? Undercover,  Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
It's not sunk !  it is conducting an 'underwater special operation' !
AAAWWW jeez all that 1980's tech went to the bottom...
It didn't sink, it's conducting a special submarine operation. Permanently.
The way Russia is reporting this is clearly tailored for domestic consumption.  It says a lot about how worried Putin is about perceptions at home.  He would rather claim the Russian Navy personnel are so incompetent that they sunk their own ship, than admit Ukraine hit it with missiles they built themselves.
Special underwater operation
How deep did it sink?  Is it recoverable/salvageable?
Oops!
So Ukraine wants to escalate the war instead of trying to solve through diplomatic means...
Russia Putin  butcher will be sink all...
A sitting duck in a pond, I mean the Black Sea.  Russia better give up their ambitions concerning the Black Sea, in todays age of missiles, ships and tanks are useless liabilities.
Message to Putin! Fuckofwski kaputski boatski! Boatski now sleeping with fishki!
URAAAA 🇷🇺🇷🇺👍💪💪
SPeCial under sea OpEration
NICE!!! I hope every last piece if scheiße ork on that ship died.
This is like Tiny Tim kicking the balls of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Ouchie.....
I'm surprised no major news outlets have footage of it actually sinking.
Off topic but I just this minute found the worlds smallest violin
even if russia is true - which they are not - there is no way in hell they can tow a vessel that large with a hole blown in the side/middle/top wherever for any length that has taken on enough water to cause it to list sideways, with any marine craft outside of a damn cargo ship. its like dragging a giant anchor. and they will not have had any way to put a flotilla under it as well as pump the water out within so many hours during hypothermic water and 20kt winds    > 1:05 SOS sent  1:14 Ship lying on its side  1:45 All power off  2:00 Turkish ship rescues 54 sailors (of 485 occupants)  3:00 Reported sunk (by Turkey and Romania)   this would have been 1am wednesday local time radio listeners reported the same sos relays eventually stopped then just repeated a locator ping  russia is caught in a catch-22  they either   1. admit their military is incompetent and stupid,   or   2. admit that it was hit by the enemy and sank
is that an android flagship or ios flagship?
Ukrainian special operation was a success, shame the Turks saved the men .
I get the feeling the U.S or U.K was behind this.. they’re playing a very dangerous game.
If Russia can't defend it's warships. then they are no match for US and their allies.  I would like to see Russia really showcase their strength, but it seems they don't have it. It looks like, it was all smoke and mirrors.
Well that's another senior member of the armed forces of Russia under arrest by their own Government!!!
So their army is useless. Their navy is useless. Their airforce? Let's 🇬🇧🇺🇲 wait and see a little longer. Then invade and attack Moscow. It would be over in weeks.
L O L
Symbolic presence? It was one of the main sources of ship launched cruise missile strikes. It was clearly more than just symbolic.
Putins pus sy force
Symbolic presence in the Black Sea? ....lol...  It's all good to call it "symbolic" until your town is catered 100km away from 1 or 2 of its cruise missiles.
I love the comments.  Some darned good reading here.  Please enjoy.
Ukraine trying to take credit..so perthetic
lol
EXCELLENT
This was all planned brilliantly by Russian intelligence. They wanted to study some Ukrainian missiles up close so they caught a couple using their flagship.
Ukraine  aka Gallipoli
When will people in leadership position think of others beside themselves God is taking records
Great shooting Ukraine!!
GOOD!!!;)
Once the real story comes out, the Russians are done!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  God Bless Ukraine!!!!!!!!!
This is good news 📰
It's so beautifully destroyed 🇺🇦
Fake news
Another win for Ukraine! Keep it up and kick those commies out of your country!
Now only if Europe would draw up some courage and morals and get dirty.
Viva  Ukraine
LOL
Great News.
The Russian military is ridiculously incompetent
Good, how many Russians can we add to the body count?
Russia is lying!  There were no storms! 😂😂😂🐳🐬🦈🐋🐟🐠🦞🐙🦑🦀🦐🧜‍♀️🧞‍♂️🌪🌬🌊
Are the Russian Public going to believe that the The Moskva has sunk due to the ineptitude of the Russian Navy, or because it was sunk due to Ukrainian Missiles? Either way it really doesn't matter what they think!!!
Ewwww! No Russian litter and junk please! The fishies might get sick, poisoned with Russian meat.
🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦💪💪💪💪💪👌👌👌👌Muy pronto, su gobierno le va a acompañar al fondo del mar...
Russian bots scrambling for excuse lmao
It did not sink, it was just converted into a submarine.
Fabulous.
Ukraine embarasses russia with incredible skill with missiles....  Russians...er no no this is lie ukraine lie yes what happen was sergai dropped his lighter and cigerettes on the bombs and they go boom no missiles hit ship all lies
My fellow Russians relax everything is going according to plan our goal is to cover this ships into a submarine so the tiny and weak Ukrainian army won’t attack us
wayy
I heard it took out the “USS The Sullivans” in a final act before being recalled to a deep deep deep sea base for upgrades. 🤔
Special submarine operation
So, either the Ukrainians sank the ship, or Russian incompetence sank the ship.  Both work for me.
Liar wicked Putin said everything in the war going as planned, the was as planned.
In time we can get divers down and see was the damage from the inside or outside of the Hull. Somebody is gonna get upset and start throwing his toys around 😡 👶 🧸
These Slava class cruisers are no joke, brimming to the teeth with S-400s and Kalibr missiles that would’ve no doubt ended many innocent Ukrainian lives. What a brilliant victory by the Ukrainian forces and hugely symbolic when the future of Mariupol is being called into question. I took my hat off a long time ago for them
they don't abandon a ship if it was still floating. it sunk.
This just goes to show that even now, Russia is still underestimating the will, skill, and determination of the Ukranian forces, and honestly, I hope Russia continues to underestimate Ukraine.
And now imagine Ukraine have NAVY?))🙏🇺🇦✌️
Victory to Ukraine, God bless Ukrainian forces.
Never rush B Cyka Blyat. See what happens!?
This Russian invasion of Ukraine will go down in history as one of the most inept, poorly planned, and poorly led military operations ever.....the Russians are making the Iraqi Army of 2003 look good.
Hey Russian ship F off.
Look , the Russians  could end this sh*t anytime
I'm anxiously looking forward to more Russian special underwater operations! I'm also expecting many Russian special underground operations, heroically executed by thousands of Russian infantry! Long live the fighters of Ukraine!
Moskva. Special military underwater operation.
Well at least Russia was right that the fire on board is under control! Great job!  😂
Hahahahahahahahahahaha
LOL Russia would rather admit epic fail stupidity than admit sunk in combat
Here we go , things are going to escalate
Russias armed forces are pitiful. If it wasn’t for nukes Russia would be part of Europe by now.
What a disaster this war has been so far for Russia... Actually its not a war, its "special operations" by putin, it is really special so far..
Special Ship Sinking Operation - Went perfectly to plan!
Russian warship has done as asked and went and fucked itself.
Soon those radioactive zombies from chernobyl will arrive and dig up stalin's carcass and reanimate him into the new czar of plutonium land.
now just making money full charge lol
FAKE NEWS back at it again
The irony is that the missiles Ukraine was using were of Russian origin...
The ship did not
https://youtu.be/VXkVZ0rloio
A moment of silence for the Russian lives lost during that sinking, many of whom I am certain didn't want to be there, didn't agree with the war, and were killed due to putins evil. War is so terrible and we have improved so little even in 2022..
Sky news fake news as well.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hope chechen leader ramdan was in the ship, when it turned into a submarine, victory to Ukraine 🇺🇦
So, how do Ukrainian farmers get to the ship?
Who cares happy days for Ukraine this won’t be showed because there is NO freedom of speech
Yes...famous black sea big storms
Comrades, do not believe Western propaganda, everything's going to plan, the Moskva had simply completed its special operation in the surface of the Black Sea and decided to focus on the main goal, the complete liberation of its bottom region.
Threatening Baltic nuclear deployment is irrelevant.   They can be fired from anywhere.   Putin has again screwed himself.   He proves himself to be an incompetent buffoon.  DAILY!  J.C.
😁 😂😁😂😁😂😁😂😁😂😁😂😁
Must have been a good fire 🔥 on board.
This is according to plan. The ship destroyed 2 Ukrainian missiles and the ship was promoted to submarine class. In addition this is the first submarine that is unmanned and does not require any fuel to operate.
Well done Zelenskyy. We need to see more and more attacks on Russian interests..
The Ukrainians have balls, they are not afraid of Russia like NATO...
Either way, a fire setting off ammunition or a missile strike. This is Embarrassing asf for Russia.  Pathetic military.  Absolutely Pathetic
Shame putin is not on it
good job，hope to watch other RUSSIA warships sink
Too bad this didn't happen on May 9-2022.
The Kremlin said it wasn't Ukrainian missiles. It was purely incompetence.
Wonderful news. Congratulations Ukraine, well done! 🇺🇦👍
Hip Hip Hooray! It's on the ground of Black Sea now! Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦 ✌ 💙 💛
Welcome to more unbiased reporting
Id bet they will say now it's an underwater  mission🇷🇺❌ 😂🇺🇦🙏
Of course it's sunk because ammunition exploded, it just happened to have been fired from the Ukranian's.  Slava Ukraine
One step closer to being rated third strongest military...
Sink more of them!  Revenge for killing Ukraine civilians & abusing them!
Ahahahahahhahahaha!
Very nice. Sink with rest. Слава Украине!!!🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇨🇦
😄 🤣 😂 😆 😄 🤣 😂
LIES...! LONG LIVE RUSSIA... 🇷🇺
It's sad that the special welcoming fireworks started a fire on the flagship of the special military operations. This is a tragic accident that was completely avoidable. Odd that it was being towed to port but sank while rescue vessels were plucking members of the Eastern Economic Growth Commission out of the water.
This has made my day
Titanic sank on April 14. What a coincidence.
Guess most wars are mindless but this one takes the cake. Ukraine is economically finished while Russia is severely crippled. The arms industrial complex is laughing all the way to the banks while rest of the world face serious inflation with millions stating at starvation.
Special seafloor inspection operation
And in hell people are looking forward to this!!!Sinking and entire Russia!

GLORY TO UKRAINE , DOWN WITH EVIL PUTINISM
Yet no footage. Probably more propaganda
Nope... It's fake news spitted by Western media 😂... It's an accident on board... Nothing to do with actors in Kiev.... The ship didn't sink lol... Btw 1026 super heroes just surrendered..
Be ready to get a atomic bomb attack.
Fake according to the Pentagon  https://youtu.be/tzmRepFvnQo?t=122
❤️
Stop spreading fake news. It hasn't sunk... Its now on a Special Submarine Operation.
"Another one bites the dust,  another one bites the dust"!!!!!!
All these reports and yet no actual pictures or video of the actual ship being destroyed?? And look at the comments filled with a bunch of goofballs believing the narrative for their own liking doesn't have the ability to do critical thinking.
Glory to Ukraine 🇺🇦✊✨
They were having a barbecue.
This is Russia invading the underwater lol 🤣
Proud to be Ukrainian.
Putin: "All is well..." 😱
Black sea nations should just put some of their naval capabilities for sale for real cheap to ukraine and ensure russians will be on the botton of the black sea where they belong.
So the Ukrainians claim to have f***ed it up with missles, but the official Russian position is that the Russian warship f***ed itself. If true, this makes the Russians look much better, as this was, in fact, requested by Ukrainian forces a month ago.
Glad they would have evacuated most of the crew before towing, but....hahahaha Russian Warship Go F*** Yourself!
Hell yeah!!!!!!☠☠☠☠
A terrifying way to go
The human-race should formally declare this boat as the Russ P*tin.
Sweet news. They would have been able to handle a weapons issue.
Very Happy to hear that!!✌️👍👍 Good job , Ukraine!✌️✌️✌️❤️
I look forward to see it in Black Sea with coral reef 🐠 growing on it ! Hopefully few Russian soldiers are still in it
News reports would be way shorter if they didn’t just keep repeating the same thing. They’d probably be outta a job if kept it simple 😂
SLAVA UKRAINE 🇺🇦 ♥️ ❤️
May ALL the Russian ships meet the same fate.   F  Puitn.
If this is true this is the most important sinking of a ship after Falkland War
It's all well and good for a bunch of adventure-tourists with press vests to go around ruined cityscapes bothering people who have lost everything to ask them how they feel, but this is a far cry from being a true war correspondent.   The reason the actual military situation of this war is being so negligently and ignorantly reported on is that there appear to be no actual war correspondents with the nerve or determination to actually accompany combat units at length, not even to mention that none of these people ever seems to have learned even the most basic tenets of tactics, strategy, weaponry, battlefield terminology or military affairs in general.   They report everything like one great big human interest story, tailored to what they must assume is an audience as fourth-grade ignorant as the reporters are.  And yes, to their credit, it is all very human, and very interesting, but it is not war reporting. It is civilian-tragedy reporting, and for what it is, some of it has been exemplary.   But we are seeing the results of a campus-liberal intelligentsia assigned by history the honor and privilege of reporting on the most crucial events in human history since the Cuban missile crisis, and all they see is a big human interest story. The military stuff, that's just sooooo icky. Leave it to the retired generals and think-tankers back home to try and make sense of the actual warfare going on, even if what they are given from colleagues in the field is so bereft of military information that all the analysts can do is say 'probably' a lot along with various partisan opinions about all things Kremlin.  The most technologically-capable status of world news reporting in known history has met the biggest story of anyone's lifetime, and they just have no idea how to go about reporting on it. The press performance in this war ought to be remembered by history as the furthest the trade of journalism has ever descended into narrative-pitching guesswork and endless editorializing based on hardly any real facts at all. And maybe, at long last, the profession will remember what its ONLY job is:  TO REPORT FACTS.
Now serving heroically as a refuge for marine wild life.
Slava Ukraini! 🇵🇭♥🇺🇦
Who really is fighting Russia in Ukraine.  I don't think its the Ukrainian army.   I sure hope we do not get mixed up in this crap.  None of it is our business.
Hard to believe there are no satellite images of the ship sinking🫡
Good news then.
Hope it drowned a lot of orc rats.
SLAVA UKRAINI!!!!!   hahahahaha!!! Moskova at bottom of the Black Sea.....hahahaha  Take that  Poo-tin!!!!
This flag ship was designed to go under water 💧 just taking a dip . Russian pride.
Well, it was a strong symbol, just for the wrong country.  :)
Gee & in the US Navy,we haven't lost a ship to hostile fire since WWII due to design & daily damage control training. THIS is what we were afraid of during the Cold War?
The sunken Moscow
and many more happy returns.
Росію якнайшвидше розпадуть і ліквідують, Путіна якомога швидше повісять, і світ заспокоїться! Україна перемагає!
Per Russian news, Moskva updated to an underwater habitat.
NICE!!!!!
It didn’t sink! It turned into a submarine!
We found that Russian battleship a-makin' such a fuss We had to sink the Moskva 'cause Ukraine depends on us We hit the ground a-runnin' when our missiles took it out We caught that Russian ship and we quickly cut her down!
I had no idea Russia was so heavily into ocean conservation. Using warships to create artificial reefs for all the marine life, Fantastic and keep at it.   o.O
Send Steven Seagal in there to finish the job.
I do not think Russia 🇷🇺 pushing hard anuff to fight there hiding sum think hold sum think back if thay wanted that much there would  off done it bye now
A good orc is a sunken orc 😀
We will Never Know what we do Not Know, But I do believe this is a sign of Russian Might! when their "FLAG SHIP" of the Black Sea Fleet Sinks at the Ripe OLD AGE of 40 plus?  God Help ALL SOLDIERS, SALORS, And AIRMEN!  This makes me Much More Comfortable with a Conventional WAR and a possible outcome, Much More UnComfortable with Puttin and his back against the wall, wounded and Weak!
Yes sir 👏 Ukraine warriors
Great news 🖒🖒🖒 Ukraine should keep on firing missiles at Russian targets even in Russia itself. Give Russia a taste of it's own medicine.
Great news
Start hitting behind enemy lines ships ports gas/oil no fuel no ships keep hitting hard
Se hundió igual a cómo se va hundir Putin su ejército y Rusia........
The front fell off.
Glory be to God in the highest
Nice
Uraaaaa 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Happy Easter everyone! I’m eggstatic!
The prophecy of Snake Island has been fulfilled.
1:15 Good news ..
Putinland is catching L after L and I am here for it, baby.
fake news as usual....Pentagon confirmed already there was no missle strike
So how many nukes went to the bottom?
Davy Jones that Rust bucket
Special Operation💣👍💪🥷
It's a good dream of Hypocritical Media.
2 Aale, mitten rein, in die Mitte 😂😂😂😂zu Befehl, Herr kaleun
Good news.
Whoever took that shot, hats off
Nice
YES!
What’s Russian for sad trombone sound?
Hell yeah
Why is tge usa involved in ukraine. US does not have any  interest there
Fake news
Much more than a symbolic ship it was a command and control center and had been used to level coastal areas with canons and missiles!
Lol the Titanic sank on my birthday - 14th of April, now Russia's flagship sinks on the 14th of April as well, what a coincidence :D
It's just denazifying the seabed!!
Slava Ukraine!!!
Well done boys stay strong 💪
This makes one rethink the Russian military effectiveness.
Looks like the 'Moskva' literally went and fucked itself!!!🤣
its not sunk its a submarine now hahahahaha
Bad karma to it for murdering Ukrainian soldiers...
So sad people still believe med!a
Does it carry Nukes on board ? 🤔
Hah ah aha ha ha hahahahahaaha
Symbolic?😂  It was the only ship with C300 system. It was the major ship in Black Sea.
Moshva has confirmed sponge bob really does exist
Funniest thing ever
Well that what putin get for pocket the billions and send a 40 year old antique to go to war. 🤣🤣🤣
750m$ is gone! GJ Ukraine
God's thumb!
The Moskva was send in a special underwater mission to find NEMO.
Rusia desaparecerá Cómo desapareció La Unión soviética
nato should be scared to the bones...another russia sub in the ocean for just a couple of hours,damn that was fast
Hahaha Hahaha Hahaha 😆 🤣 😂 😅 😄 😜
🇺🇦💯👍🇺🇦
Who is happy about this!
It joined the french navy :D
In my opinion if Russia really wants to take Ukraine, they need to start going all out and use their big boy toys (non-nuclear). Russia is a massive military power and if they could completely destroy Ukraine in one evening if they wanted to and there would be nothing that anyone could do about it. I guess NATO could intervene and then things would escalate quickly from there. I'm a US citizen, why in the heck do we care if Russia takes Ukraine? If they did, would that be a DIRECT threat to the national security of my country? No, it wouldn't! - Now I'm all for sending humanitarian aid to Ukraine and the surrounding nations but NO weapons of war.   If Putin were to decide to go further and attack a NATO member country, well then it's on but not for Ukraine, we have no obligation to help Ukraine.
FANTASTIC!!! God Bless Ukraine!
They shouldn't have bragged about the Bayraktar distraction. Now if they try to do it again the Russians will know whats going on.
Fake news. The ship was towed back to Russia for repair. West media makes up stuff its maddening
Its gonna get even more interesting when the Harpoon enters the theater of war.   I filmed/ videoed that Ship in Sevastopol in 2004.  So cool its gone...
Slava Ukrainii! 🇲🇩❤️🇺🇦
Haha not more
All the crew is probably sent to Sibir for 10 year.
wow one Russian ship sinks. Only 349 more to go...........
Another great succes by the Russian Navy in a perfectly conducted ""Special Seafloor Operation"", and now we all hold our breaths in the greatly anticipated ""Special Putin Is Honestly Not Into ALL This War-Stuff Operation""which undoubtedly will executed with perfect Russian precision.
good
:30. 🤔 🤦🏾‍♂️ 🤣🤣🤣🤣 The same video western media piggy backed on and said “Everyone on the island, Dead” Then Russia released the video, taking all said soldiers as prisoners with no female soldiers present on island. Moskva was a weak ship anyways, nothing compared to the Kirov. Shipwreckers do just that and wreck ships.
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes!
We r all laughing at Russia   the world is hahaga squareheads
Not sunk….!, just in spécial operation under the sea !…
Really? Moskva 🇷🇺 was fall 😮
With this ship and the other one as well and all the the other material and equipment lost in Ukraine and the sanctions the economy for Russia is looking bleak - the Oligarchs will not be able to steel as much from the state coffers as before and the ordinary Russian will get hard times ahaed.
F in the chat for russia
Old video and propaganda
Bye bye Moskva!
Yoohooooo
I toured this ship in 1989. It was a very large cruiser loaded down with weapons.  Big loss for the Russian Navy.
Another weapon of death sinks to the bottom of the sea, good riddance!
It's just a cooking accident.
fFre on board, directed energy wave ,burned /borrowed  through . No lives lost thankGod  old ship, had a good run for its money   best to let it go &   that was that.
Sweeeet!
"Russian warship go F*** yourself"
It was sunk by Ukrainians ! Can't believe Russia on anything . Simply propaganda !
Simply special operation without casualtys
This reminds me when the Argentinians sunk the HMS Sheffield such a powerful navy completely been manhandled by a much smaller nation
"Mokkwa"? Who is that aged chicken? With a probably correct Argentinian pronunciation of "Moskva"...
Someone is getting force choked 🤣
A great hit to Putin's groin and ego. Russia will inevitably continue its decline as sanctions start to destroy Russian's economy which is well deserved
Can't love this enough.
Bye jackaseaes
Great news, Moskva rest in peace on the bottom of the sea 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Russia's special military operation is still 'going to plan' I see.
Same time sky try to lie people since Russia start war in Ukraine everything from Russia it bad #skynews this is 2022 not yeah America was in Vietnam 🙊
Of course, the cruiser was deliberately sunk in order to put out the fire that arose after the action of British agents as soon as possible ... Generalissimus Putin then melts the boiler on the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, to which is added the newly painted Aurora.
40yrs old is about average of Russian man life expectancy with all those vodka 😂
has it  sunk ?????????
As western media celebrates the sinking of the Bismark, Russia appears to have established a new interesting reef dive site. I just wonder why Putin didn't hold on to the ship for promotional purposes in freediver-style en route to the new destination. His riding bear probably didn't like the lukewarm water that much...
Kremlin: "It has deployed its special submersible capabilities"
Slava Ukraine
Putin: "This ship did not sink. It was converted for subsurface operations according to plan."
Omg they are such compulsive liars, Ships don't usually mysteriously catch fire then sink?
Special weather operation
Another embarrassing news for Russia 🥱 😂
...and 'Moscow' sinks....how ironic🤣
Nice to see the farmers are giving the fishermen something to do . Expect the ship to be towed away soon. 🤣🤣🤣
🇺🇦👍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Glory to Ukraine indeed.
"...And throw off the shackles of Moscow."  From their (the Ukrainian)  military anthem.
🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
40 years old isn’t old for a ship, Sky News.
Come on Russia  kill the Ukraine president
good. the more russian armor and ships and jets that get destroyed the worse off they are.
It's not too surprising it would sink considering the Russians stated it had been fully evacuated, normally a military wouldn't do that unless the damage was incredibly severe as the crew is normally needed for damage control, the damage must have been significant for them to do that and unchecked flooding would cause it to founder under tow.  This is the same ship Ukrainians told to go F*** themselves very early on in the war, now that the survivors of the Snake Island battle have been released and given medals the sinking of the Moskva is the cherry on top.
Was this the one full of Bentleys,  Porsches, Lamborghinis and a p.o.s. Volkswagen Jetta?
The ship was built in Ukraine. Russia will have to buy the replacement from India. China owns a Ukrainian built aircraft carrier.
GO  UKRAINE
Russia could've been part of our European family but chose war instead. What a tragic blunder. 😔
I like the Russian way of saving face no no no we blew up our own ship.
We never seen such thing happen since like ww2, a capital warship sinking like that is a huge moral booster to ukraine.
Well done Ukraine. It increasingly pisses me off that mainstream media give any credence to anything lying Russians say.
Det är inget problem för Ryssland, eftersom kan peter den störe kan ersätta  Moskova krissnings fartyget...! Och några strategiska ubåtar...och dem är inte bra signaler fö Ukraina... Det borde att Nato och européerna öppna nån korridor med Ryssland  i stället skickar vapen ...man ska diskutera innan hända nån otrevligt i Europa...!
Russian ships get towed back and Russian tanks towed away by Ukrainian farmers. Slave Ukraine 🇺🇦
Not true!just file it with. The Ghost of Kiev, Snake Island.. Boucha 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Mr. Putin,pls avenge the rfs moskva,1 of my favourite war ship😭
👍😂👍😆👍🤣👍👌Blubb, Blubb, Blubb, ra, ra, rasPutin 👏💯💪
Russia can take its pick of excuses.  1) complete incompetence of its Navy, or 2) Ukraine soldiers hit it with two missiles.
russia sure has proved, we would woop there asses in ww3... only hope they got is there 6k nukes lol.....
lmfao one down.. ...... 🇺🇦
What??? Russian tanks useless now their warships are just as worthless. The Moskva carrying out a "Special Sinking Military Operation". Slav Ukraini!!!
All part of Putins "Special military operation"....which has succeeded in creating an undersea village for Russia!
yesssss a new putin class submarine
Moscow next if they dont deter their BS
Lol
When maskova was burning. Mariopol.was being captured.  Russia lost something, ukraine lost something,
Not just a symbolic presence, Moskva had air denial S-300 anti-aircraft missile system for naval use installed in the ship, also tactical missiles "Kalibr" that shelled Ukrainian cities were launched from this ship, and last, but not least - presence of Black sea naval headquarters on the ship. All in all - great victory for Ukraine against Russian aggression.
Ahhhh, hahahahaha, ahhhhhhh hahahahahaha!!! 😂😂😂🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🥰
God bless ukrainian.
Ahahhahhaa reporting sink but no evidence hhahahhahaha give me reciept to belirve 😁😁😁😁
L
Either incompetence by the Russian naval personnel or tactical brilliance of the Ukrainians. Regardless, it is a win for the Ukrainians.
Sky News: Trump Sinks Russian Ship!
That thing needed to be sunk
Nuke Ukraine go russia
Even the weather knows the right side in this battle of good vs evil
This is a symbolic downing of the Moscow.  Next the city of Moscow will come down, thanks to Putin’s own stupidity.
Cant Wait for the Satellite & Missiles Camera Footage of Russias Newest Submarine ..Accident Haha.. the full Russian fleet have fleed further out to sea.. Says it all !  New Long Range Missile Systems have landed.. ,Caught the Russians cold  They clearly thought they were out of range ..whoops Ya snooze ya Lose This is By far the Greatest Ukrainian Victory !!  Of the Entire War !
Judging by some of the comments the people in charge of the Russian bots and troll factories have not been told that Russia has admitted it is a non-flagship now..Just quibbling about how it became an ex-flagship....It is deceased..It was only floating because it was nailed on its perch....IT HAS CEASED TO BE !
I'll sleep well tonight. I've been dreaming about this for weeks. 🇺🇦❤️🙏
Special sinking operation big humiliation to Putin clown by Ukraine  🤣🤣😂😂😅👌🏼👍💪💛💙
What idiot names a flagship after his capital city... Even Hitler had enough brain cells to change the name of a cruiser that was named Deutschland, cuz ofc "Sinking of a warship, always possible, would be a propaganda disaster if it bore the name of its country"!!!
Putin's gona be pissed
Kremlin propaganda alert! Watch out for Kremlin financed comments in  under this video clip. The Guardian 13 Apr reported: The head of Russian  state-controlled propaganda television news network RT, Margarita  Simonyan, has described how Russia’s covert operations continue the  Kremlin’s info-wars by circumventing various blocks by YouTube and other  media platforms.  “We’re now creeping down partisan roads so that no one even knows its  us,” the editor-in-chief said.  “We’re not doing it under our brand,” Simonyan said alluding to the  notion that Russian propaganda continues to be spread in the west, while  hiding the fact that it’s Russian propaganda.  “I won’t divulge any other details,” she added.
How fit  for bottom feeders!
i gotta say, it was a good day
Stand with Russia 🇷🇺
Love it!
Moskva is fine. She's just on a Special Diving Operation.
God is at work
Slava Ukraini!!! 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
👏 🇺🇦👏🇺🇦👏🇺🇦
Very good twanty more to go Slava Ukraine
The most valuable ship in the Russian navy? The tugboat
I love to hear that keep it up
Good really that’s what they get
The flagship Moskva is now doing a special underwater operation!  🤣
We're their nukes onboard?
Fake news.
It Z ank in the Z ea
That's what my Ukrainians worries have to focus on, and destroy anything that would treated them, that's a good new, nonetheless, it's very sad that those Russian soldiers have to fight a war that most of them wouldn't want to do, that's what happens when a nation is run by a dictator, that's what one gets. Long live freedom and democracy in Ukraine and around the world ,patria y vida.
Wheres the footage of fire or sinking. Come on now news people
All that money down the drain?
Hooray!
Haha got em 😜
Was it blackjack the pirate who wanted  1 million bounty
flesruoY kcuF oG pihsraW naissuR
The not so mighty Russian army 😂
So much for the powerful S-300 air-defense system that was installed on that ship and was supposed to cover not just "Moskva",  but the entire Black Sea fleet that was operating in that area.
Good riddance to those orks. Just another piece of Russian military hardware turned into a wreck. May it have sunk with all warmongering hands. Glory to Ukraine
No one cares
Sometimes I'm to suspicious of this war Ukraine is winning at all sides so easily. Its not like that moscow is just that stupid sending troops and millions worth of equipment to their deaths. It seems like there is something else in this war.
Russia: In the name of climate change We decided that it was necessary for the health of the planet to build a new reef in this area of the ocean…
It is understood they planned this ship submerging manouvre very carefully to conscript new recuruits for their tank divsions. Officials have stated that they are now looking underwater in particular to conscript amoebas and spirogellas as they fully expect these invertabrates will fight with more spine than their human Russian conterparts.
Sink ‘‘em all them basterds
We all know who is responsible for sinking Russia.  Putin is responsible and Ukraine did it!
Given the decrepit state of the Russian navy maybe it’s time the u.s. claims the Black Sea.  Just saying.
Putin's next move will be to denazify the sea. Beware bald fishes!
🇺🇸🇺🇦❤️🤍💙💛
👂🏻🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦✌️✌️
Itll make a beautiful reef.
Putin is going to destroy Russia for sure, if not Ukraine.
This Russian navy need more training how to use warship and cooperate. Lmao
Sunk under tow -  This next big push is pointless Putin will not be allowed to keep any gains - wars are about economies - think how many allies Ukraine has and how few Russia have - Belarus Syria & tictok Czechia
Good to see Russia contribute this to Ukraine in their creation of an  artificial reef.
Russia needed to scrap it but that ship so this was done deliberately , false flag victory
Some tractor 🚜 is on the way to Black Sea to pull 🇷🇺 Russian  warships
NICE 👍 10,000 bonus points 🥳
It took Putins dreams and delusions with it
Russia should unconditionally surrender. Slava Ukraine!!
just a fake news no sink video😂
When is Putin sending the next war ship for target practice
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣👍 going down just like Russia!
A good opportunity to stop this senseless "special operation" right away.
Bummer 😆
This is a victory felt throughout the world. Ukraine A warship can cause so much catastrophe. But God got to it first and made space on the ocean floor.
Everything goes according to plan. The cruiser has changed the field of operations - now it is a submarine  😉
I wonder who's going to get a holiday to siberia for that f@#kup?
Well that's quite the kick in the gonads for Pootin. Good to hear 😂🙂
This war in Ukraine has exposed the weaknesses of the Russian military. Who would have thought the Ukranians could match, even overpower the Russian army? Now this.
Where's the video of it sinking? Or the video of the so called ammunition explosion by the Russian media.
This wont make any difference...
Putin arrest by genocide. Putin familys look in EU swiss.
It is a guided missile cruiser. Not a missile cruise ship.
lol
cya later, alligator
Slava Ukrajini
Awww. That is really sad...NOT
Nah, it didn't sink. It was just an ''special submarine conversion''
Gureetee  wars will turn to nuclear  wars soon    will happy for the west  that's  like nuclear  wars on earth
man i love the moskva on world of warships. rip to the crew.
Congratulation Ukraine!  Now off to the Kremlin to utterly INCINERATE it!
Mokva 🤦‍♂🤦‍♀
The ship has sunk, now town ( and whole country ) may follow.
So either the Ukrainians did hit the ship or the Russian crew is totally incompetent. Neither looks good for Russia.
SKY NEWS quote  "Russian Defence Ministry says that their Black Sea fleet flagship Moskva has  sunk (? how can it be SUNK when being towed to port?)  after a fire forced the vessel to be towed to port..." They lie again WHY can't the news simply tell the truth... They said that it was attacked by missiles but first they said shells... Are they going to be embarrassed when this ship comes back to life like the last one they sunk... Now that say a storm make up your mind... WHERE is the journalist that check facts... Its sure not  not SKY NEWS...
mokva
Well done 🇺🇦  👍
Wont get another one of them from amazon
I pray for Ukraine 🙏🇺🇦
good job Ukraine!
Don't believe what Russia is saying (remember, Russia has no plans to invade Ukraine). 100% Ukraine sunk the Moskva.
moskca didn't sink, its a submarine now..
good job
Sweden and finland should join nato. How can Russia attack these countries while struggling with Ukraine this badly at the same time ?
Ukrainians turned a cruiser into a submarine
Karma.doesnot matter.all killers will face their karma.
USA and UK should stop harassing Ukraine to continue this war and stop lying, there is NO way Ukraine can win this war.    The ego and interests of the USA and the UK do not allow Ukraine and Russia to reach a peace agreement.    Many Ukrainians are dying and their cities are being destroyed.  USA & UK don't care if Ukrainian soldiers die.     This war may last for years and many more Ukrainian soldiers will die.  USA and UK should stop harassing this war and stop making things up against Russia doing Joseph Goebbels style bad propaganda.    Zelensky should open his eyes and realize that he is a puppet of the USA and the UK and therefore he is letting his soldiers die in this war that in the end he will not win.
So what is the big deal here. In 2000 the USS COLE was attacked by a small boat in Yemen while refueling. 17 US sailors were killed. Whether accident or not. What is the big deal here?
Are they saying that the Russian warship went and fucked itself?
They only had six major ships in the Black Sea. Hmm.
https://youtu.be/8b5BEXdGFiY
Too much money has corrupted Musk's brain.  Trump is one of the worst liars in the world.
Oops! Now, it had sunk! The once, proud Russian, Black Sea, mighty cruiser! I just got two words to add to that.... Victory Ukraine! 🇺🇦✊
To sink , or not to sink, that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The drones  and Cruise missile  of outrageous Ukraine, Or to take Arms against a Black Sea of troubles
What a waste.
Idiot Russians probably scuttled their own ship lol
Well, only justefied,
Distracted by a drone?! That’s comedy!
Russia militery is not good as they said. Putin is upset at his subordinates and purged 150 members of his spy department. Putin will be killed by his subordinates.
This ship was being used as a brutal terror weapon. A great victory for the Ukrainians.
It's a pity all on board didn't go down with it
40 years old battleship that was upgraded with auto parts.
HA HA HA HA HA!!!! Russian sailors bodies will be washing up on the shores of Ukraine soon, or be eaten by the fish. Good job Ukraine.
Not easily replaced.  Half a Bil. replacement cost on paper (will go WAY over that IRL) plus she lost 64 S-300s and there's been some stories now (not sure how vetted) that she may have been carrying nukes as well.  Total monetary cost alone is insane and as others point out, it's a huge morale blow too.
Isn't this a old news?
Hahaha, so the Russians would rather scuttle the evidence they were hit by Ukraine misile than bring the evidence back to port. Just guessing.
New mission Finding Nemo
The demilitarization of Russia is all going according to plan.
"Moscow under water, Putin wets himsel!"
Yeah fires don't just randomly break out on a warship for no reason.

Send a drone distraction then k-pow.  Great sucker-punch, ko to the bottom.  😎
Not going so well is it Vlad....?  He will now have a tantrum and do a bit of bombing and commit a few more war crimes..What a sad little man..Emphasis on the little..
It has fucked itself
Black Whole Russian 121 O No Putin Army's Are In Trouble Now This is Ukraine Victory 🙌🙌
I hope that the next ship that sinks will be the one with Putin in it.
Yeah, and all those tanks destroyed had nothing to do with the Ukrainians either.
Enjoy It a sweet dream in the Deep sea 😁😁😁
Slava Ukraini
send it to the botton of the black sea and sink more of them
I see that as well as its tanks, Russia has also set it's ships on auto-destruct mode...just to confuse everyone. Slava Ukraini.
Even the Russian bots and stooges seem to be giving up. 🚨👌🤡👍🚨
A relatively old ship, think that says more about the Russian navy than the actual sinking.  Guess submarines get the priority.
Awesome.
The Mosva´s special underwater operation is going according to plans.
and a Russian admiral stated the neptune missile cannot sink them, lol!
Russia is seriously running out of weapons.
Old geriatric stupid leaders, full of fear and prescription medications, cant tell what day it is, but still remember hate🚽
Fantastic! It is a Good Friday after all!
Time to use a nuclear weapon
Russians: "Amunition went on fire."   I totally believe this statement! First it was Ukrainian amunition, seconds later the Russian. :)))
😂😂😂😂😂
Glory, glory hallelujah 🌈🇺🇦 !
CNN is saying it sank. Knowing CNN, the Russians are probably using it for water skiing.
So, question for Donald Trump and his Republican Party lackeys _:_ Putin not so much of a genius after all?
That cruiser is exactly the ship that became well known all over the world a month ago when she offered the Ukrainian military on island Zmiinyi to surrender and got that famous answer: "Russian ship go fu%ck yourself"! He was hit by 2 Ukrainian anti-ship missiles "Neptune" which have a range of up to 280 km. 2 missiles were launched cuz the Ukrainian military supposed that one of them could be shot down by the ship's air defense. But Russians fu%cked up... as usual and both rockets hit "Moskva" Glory to Ukraine!
It is an embarrassment to Russia either way.  Missile strikes or on board fire caused by ?
I know people from all around the world, but have yet to meet a happy Russian. Glory to Ukraine
It is not a "Symbolic presence", that missile cruiser had a huge array of naval analogue of the S300 air defense systems and was supposed to provide an air defense for the landing and cargo ships operating near Odessa and Nikolayv. Without it these ships will be handicapped by the hidden batteries of Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles Ukraine has on the coast. Whatever it is - brilliance of Ukrainian forces or sheer incompetence of Russian navy - it is a very real factor in the ongoing war, not just some morale booster. Glory to the Ukraine!
Wolverines 🇺🇦🇺🇲
It’s almost like God is also against the Russian navy. Not only did the boat explode, but then there was a storm as well - just to ensure it absolutely had no chance of survival
I'm sure Biden will take credit for sinking the ship
Lets goo good job
Outstanding!!! We there any portable crematoriums on board? I did think so.
Putin: The war is going according to plan.  The free world: Great plan
Who cares how it got damaged. Its gone. Now no threat to Ukraine!!
It was certainly more than a showpiece. It handled air defense for the fleet, and had many missile launchers and probably also the fleet's C&C.
Does that mean for the cost of x2 Neptune missiles, Ukraine is basically forcing the Russian Navy back 300km from land? That could screw up Russian air control systems
I have been seeing Russian TV reports that Russian tanks just explode for no reason when Ukrainian drones fly overhead.   Kind of makes winning the cold war not so big a deal...
Great 👍
"Nyet, Nyet-- the Russian people have gifted to the Black Sea a brand new artificial reef! We celebrated with fireworks, of course!"
That’s a good news ...If it’s true
Distracted by a Drone!!  What all of them?  Its a shame we didn't realise how bad the Russian military was years ago.
Russia is now claiming they sank the USS Sullivan in New York. They even posted the picture of it.
Since Russia is losing a lot of its Military tech it is becoming a soft target, a bit like an own goal.
Ship did not sink, that's how russian wash their ship.
Lol even if it was a fire that’s still really sad.  We all know it was a missile though.
Well, seems like the Russian warship finally f'ed itself lol
Glory To Ukraine.
Russian Navy: It wasn't Ukrainians, it was our own incompetence and god's wrath.
God bless and Glory to 🙏🙏🇺🇦
At what point does the world realize these "russians" are natzis, completely this isn't a joke, they would like everyone gone that's not one of them, Nato, Biden quite being cowards and go in! The madness must stop! LETS ROLL!
Putin is redesigning the Russian fleet... The new fleet will have glass bottoms so they can see the old fleet!
😂 Russia really looks like a total biiiotch these days
Hahaha excellent job Ukraine's kicking as Good for them doing a great job let's all help them out
GLORY TO UKRAINE!!!
Slava Ukraini!  Early May 9th present for Putin.
👏🤙👍☝️
Ammunition exploded because of a fire, fire caused by being hit by 2 Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missiles😂 Slave Ukraine
Good news, everyone!  More dead war criminals, fewer russian weapons to target.  слава україна!
BS. It had fire on bord,  but it is still waking to port.
Started special underwater operation
The denazification of Spongebob is started.
"no no no, it's not Ukrainians that sank our ship, WE sank our ship. Checkmate Ukrainians"
Russian warship has fucked itself
I hope it was not so deep where the battlecruiser sank so that one day scuba divers can have a look at the ship, take some photos/videos and monitor the "special underwater coral operation " that it is conducting.
IT HAPPENS IN WAR , NO BIG DEAL , GET SOME FREST NEWS . DARLING
Kicks Putin in his Vlaginameer
"it was our missiles that caused the damage due to a fire onboard."  Yeah, your missles caught fire and caused damage alright, AFTER the ship was hit by a Ukrainian missle and started the fires.
special underwater operation".  hahahahaha loosers
*Take this opportunity, let so call Boris's gate or whatever, ONE lousy little party *UK media in most part making totally worthless *capitol crime! Trump violated 50 plus time right in front of media! EU or Germany, France, Italy, Spain, etc. do not even make a news and even if it does, it is small or disappear! PM Johnons and his DM, FM all are doing excellent job in dangerous situation and *urging from *claimed to be older wiser and wise man say, DROP the worthless Boris gate whatever and get on with HOW TO *once for all in hundreds years,* totally warranted *totally degrade Russian Military when we HAVE golden opportunity thanks to Ukraine super brave people's small ocean of blood by helping Ukraine without ANY hesitation aside from fulfilling Budapest International agreement really US and UK refused to stood by when Ruskies broke the 1994 Budapest Agreement! STILL US and UK are NOT going far enough training F-15, F-16, Apache, M1A1, Challenger Tank, under water UAVs to sink Russian submarines sending caliber cruise missiles with 100-percent impunity! USA
'Might remember'? - it was mere hours ago.  Good riddance Moskva. Let's hope it's a symbol of the downfall of Russia's tyrannical new expansionism.
hahaha nice!  hopefully they sink more in the coming weeks. losing their expensive ships should hit Putin far worse than losing soldiers or vehicles. It would be nice if they manage to get some of their newer ships though.
That's huge. Well done Ukraine
Its a submarine now 😅
Nuke them
"...And in other news the Ukrainian government has adopted 'F*ck around and find out' as the new national slogan..."
Just looked at the Black sea weather forecast and it had a max of 12 m.p.h. winds. Someone not telling the truth about the sinking ?
I don't think the primary function of the drone was to distract the crew, it was more likely there to confirm the location and heading of the ship, so that the missiles could be targetted correctly. Any 'distraction' it caused would have been a bonus.
The fact their flagship was commissioned around the time of the Falklands War and is still in service says it all. Sorry, was in service.
Bullshxt news media
Embarrassing to say the least ..lol
Damn I didn't know it was submersible
LOL
16 nuclear weapons at the bottom of the sea = not good for Earth
Blitzmerker.
Fake war ! Simple how could a Super power be so Crap lol 😂
NATO on the trigger
Woop! Well done Ukraine
Quick!  Put some goldfish inside.
Well done Ukraine!
Slava Ukraine!
Propaganda war
If Russia says it sank because of a fire, the truth then probably is it was hit by Ukrainians!
Putin to the russian comrads: Now i just want to make it official,  there was no need to that much battleships, Moskva is now our newest submarine!
😂
i heard that a Ukrainian farmer was seen towing it away for scrap
I am wondering if the russian nuclear arsenal is going to blow up in their face due to outdated technologies or equipment or a pre set clock from a previous programmer
Lol, typical news channel, this is not the Russian "FLAG" ship. Get the story right please.
Great achievement by Ukrainian forces.  Congratulations 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
Glug glug glug. Good riddance.
That's what happens when your premium account runs out on War Thunder and World of Warships.

GO 🇺🇦
Propaganda finest +1️⃣
Russian are getting very good lesson in towing large ship. flagship was being towed and their only flattop was being towed too.
Good news is...it'll be another artificial fish sanctuary!🐟🐠🐡🐟🐙🦀🐳🦈
Has Russia built any new ships since "The Soviet Era"?
ah, Moscov burned... Such beautiful words for every Ukrainian. Unfortunately, not the city, but still...
Congratulations to UKRAINE. HIP HIP, HORAY !
"was the flagship" :) Russia can choose that it was attacked and hit by their incompetence, or that it caught fire due to their incompetence. Both look pretty darn bad
🤔🤣😂😅☝️🤣😅😂
Ukrainians: C8    Russian Navy: Чѳu sциk my Бдttleship!
Queue the Price is Right horn...
Somebody left the water on!
Slava Ukraina.💙💛
Imagine that, the best Russian Naval Warship in the Black Sea just caught fire and sank after getting hit by rain.
GOD BLESS UKRAINE
Special underwater operations  ?
PUHLEEEZE tell me there is footage of that thing being struck, or going down.
May all Russian ships sink ✨✨✨🙌.. from the force of the Ukrainian people 🙏
Interesting that both Ukraine and Russia still claim to have sunk the flagship.
Bye Putin
Checkmate Moskva!
off to davie jones locker !!!
Ofcourse! It's a haunted ship. Look how much blood it spilled
Bloody Brexit.
Love it when a story has a happy ending
Boo-sheet.
Yahoo. Its been sunk, its been sunk Hahahaha.
How dyu like that Putin? Hahaha LOL LMAO!!! Eternal culture🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Made in Russia, don't be surprised.
Cruiser? No its a submarine...
Ok nice 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦☝️☝️☝️🇵🇭
party time!!!
It sunk a while ago... and not because of the storm.
The Moskva is now a submarine.🤣
Hahaah excellent, special operation ship on the bottom of the sea.
I hope this is symbolic. The Russian people deserve freedom and prosperity.
Proceeding exactly according to plan.
Slava  Ukraine
Oopsie doodles.
Moskva has officially undergone *special sunk operation*
Russia needed a new submarine. 10D chess move by grandmaster Putin.
🥂🥂🥂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🌻🌻🌻🌻
Comrades!  We will make it an underwater museum!
Bravo
Putin better go home before he loses everything.
Sir, we have been struck by a cruise missile, we are on fire and sinking!  A GREAT VICTORY... Tell Putin we have taken a large area of the seabed today.
Na na naa na  na na naa na 𓂸
The cost of war ...... World's largest plane gone. Russian flagship gone. Human lives wasted. Properties destroyed. For what gain? Vanity.
😂
More garbage 🗑️ at the bottom of Black Sea 🤣
This might be one of those cases where both sides are telling the truth. Ukrainians shot missiles at Moskva and hit it. Damage wasn't lethal by itself, but secondary explosions eventually caused so much damage that ship became useless in intended purpose and has become submarine. Result is still the same: one more failed submarine vessel.
Nice one😁😊
Russia is a joke.
Putin is a terrorist
LOL
This just in. Surface navies are obsolete.
No russian trolls commenting on any of the posts!!! Is this a first???
So, 50 days into Pooptin's 'Special Military Operation' one Flagship sunk, elite paratroopers decimated, countless military tanks, artillery and supply vehicles destroyed, airforce incurring continuous losses plus 12 Generals and thousands of soldiers dead. Makes me wonder if his nukes can even be launched and get beyond Moscow.
By now everyone knows that what Russia says, we should believe the opposite. Russia lies, lies and lies. They believed on their own propaganda when started this war
Ukraine sinks Moskva (Москва - Moscow in Russian). How fitting. This war will sink Moscow and Putin with it.
Distracting with a drone......NICE!!!
That was operation Ctrl+Z
Neptune himself would have been pleased
Slava Ukraini!
I read somewhere that Putin has commanded that Russian oligarchs mega yachts will join the mighty Russian 🇷🇺 navy. Ukranian 🇺🇦 coastal artillery aim on target please !  Greetings from Germany...🍺🖐
I don't care whether it was Russian mishandling of ammunition or the Ukrainians hitting the vessel with missiles, great news all around.
Putin...that made my day!!
The Russian army totally screwing up and the Russian navy says hold my beer.
That's Russia's biggest best ship in the Black Sea Fleet. Dam!!!
Media: Flagship "Moscow" did not sink, it underwent a spontanous transformation into submarine mode.
Didn't they say this thing could sink US super carriers?
“ For months, we have been making triumphant retreats before a demoralized enemy, who is advancing in utter disorder”  -Eric Frank Russell
We will never surrender. Life is not purchased with chains and shackles.
Putin: No no they didnt sink it, we sank it ourselves. Everything is going to plan.
Of course there was a fire that damage the ship,that happened when the Neptune hit it,what were they expecting? The Neptune wasn’t loaded with candy! 😂😂😂…..🤣🤣🤣
THE hands of  GOD
YAY
Sink the rest ✌️
This ship was cursed, "Russian War ship, Fawk Off"
So Russian Warship really did go and f##k itself, How nice.
🎉🇺🇦🎊👍🇺🇦🎊
How’s Russia gonna spin this one now, gremlins punched a whole in the haul, kitchen fire, Hot Mexican food night, what?
No no, the ship was transformed to a submarine, and is on a special mission at the bottom of the black sea 😉
Sweet
Moscow sunk today Putin sunk next
russians have zero credibility
There was neither serious wind (5-10 kn) nor ship sinking waves in the northwestern Black Sea (60-80 cm) during 14th of april ;)
Nato is fighting and doing everything, Ukraine taking the name
Russian Media: "The Moskva was damaged due to exploding ammunition..." Reality: "...due to being hit by a pair of missiles fired from Russia's victims."
went down for special operation under the sea, that's russian pootin explanation
Yes, good.
Either way she's lost. Karma sucks eh?
Having a bad day Putin?
Brilliant.
HAHA! As if, they think that blowing up their own boat is somehow better than admitting they got struck by missiles 😂
Booyah……take that Putin, Trump, Tucker Carlson and the rest of Fox News.
Imagine the amount of copium needed by Russian forces to deal with such a massive teabagging from Ukraine.
The Moskva is Fubar 😆
One of the happiest days of Mt life seeing Russian military die
Satellite should be able to tell whats going on
Wonderful news!
👍🏻
Shipyard job security.. war = jobs yo. And yet Russia still controls 85% of the black sea coast ... not bad for 4 weeks with a country NATO'S pouring weapons and training into for a half decade,  settle down folks.
The whole Russia / Ukraine situation is incredibly sad, an absolute tragedy for all involved.
Bravo🇺🇦👏👏🇺🇦👏🇺🇦🇺🇦👏👏🇺🇦👏👏🇺🇦🇺🇦👏👏👏👏🇺🇦
Special military  sinking operation 😊
Moskva sunk 🤣 how symbolic.  Soviet "greatness" called Moskva what a joke and now sleeping with the fishes.
There is something about ships sinking that triggers the human brain  big ones small ones  people love watching ships sink   they get excited and ooh and ahh  watching something sink under the water
This makes no difference whatsoever tactically really. that ship only had old anti warship missiles on it and was never used to launch any missile strikes onto land this entire conflict as it isn't even capable of that. Likewise it is old as hell and its modern replacement which is a massive helecopter carrier warship is already in dry dock being built. I'm sure it is very embarrassing for the Russians tho lol. but seriously it's not anywhere near the big deal thats Ukraine and everyone is trying to make it out to be. Like I said modern replacement ship almost finished and its a levels nastier warship and all the ships capable of land strikes are just fine including many ships that can hit Ukraine w hyper sonic and Cruz missiles all the way from the Caspian sea no problems.
GJ Ukrainians, using the oldest trick in the book against the Russian ship. The old " Look over here trick ".... Meanwhile - ( BOOM, BOOM, Russian ship gets hit from behind )" Slava Ukraini.  🇺🇦🇬🇧
A fire broke out in the galley while making borscht, which in turn set off explosions in the munitions.
Fake news!!! It is in hiding.......... Those clever russians
Putin will be wanting Abramovichs yachts.
Titanic the ship 🛳 of dreams have sunk
"Fires and explosions on Mosva under control"...in Russian parlance.
Two ships from Russia sunk. When was the last time any country lost major naval vessels in war since WW2? Especially from a super power?
Good
"Russian warship, go f**k youself" Slava Ukraini
Breaking News: Putin announces phase 1 of ship sinking complete
🤣 Take that
Great news
The Russian military is more and more being exposed as a paper tiger or in this case a paper bear.
It's unlikely they would fire missiles without taking video of it.
Always love a good diving wreck, good for Ukraine economy, keep them coming Ukraine.
russia a once feared force but now a weakened joke of a outfit.
*Ah SKY news.* They want to be better than CNN and they succeeded every day.......at giving us fake news. According to them that ship sank twice. Once yesterday and *'again'* today. I'm *LMFAO*
That's the way to do it! Start with the Russia flagship then work your way down! Ukraine sink them all!
it is not sunk, it converted to a submarine.
Missile cruise ship? Maybe Janes needs to update its definitions…
The reason of the sinking was a big fart of the Chef in the kitchen, which propagates Fire everywhere and destroy the ship.....oh my gooood!!! 😱😱😱
It didn't sink. It was just instantly converted into a submarine.
THE MIGHTY RUSSIAN MILITARY!!!         WONDER HOW MANY OF THEIR ICBM's WILL BLOW UP UPON LAUNCH...OR JUST "REFUSE TO SERVE" AND NOT WORK AT ALL.....
Moskva is now a Kursk-type sub
BREAKING NEWS: RIA confirms the Moskva is doing “Special Manoeuvres” at the BOTTOM of BLACK SEA!  🇺🇦🚀🛳🔥🇷🇺🌊☠️
When two tyrants fight best not to pick sides. Just help the victims.
Well done ukranians. This Red army looks likes the Persians of Serse. Plenty of quantità buy low quality
There. Was. No. Stormy. Weather.  Just look at the weather.....!
The flagship of the navy, the terror of the seas His guns have gone silent at last
There really was no good way to spin this for Russian state news. A strike... or a blunder? I hope this will be another tiny nudge of the public awareness and opinion of the Russian people about this "special operation".
Awesome
Does it really matter who sunk it... as long as it gone who cares... let Putin take the credit..
So now it's time for another Moskva (Moscow) to be sunk.
good move russia! so putin doesnt have to admit that it was destroyed by Ukraine after all
Thanks to all the friends of my Ukraine for their help. Now, to win, we do not have enough combat aircraft and MLRS with a firing range of more than 200 km to attack Russian airfields. Loan them to us for a month and in the summer NATO will not have to worry about the Russian army
Bravo Ukraine.  2 missiles is much more likely than a fire on the ship. Especially when there are pictures showing smoke coming out from two places on the ship. Midship and aft. Good hunting, good shooting!
This is a devastating blow to Russian pride and prestige. The Ukrainians deserves a lot of credit for actually beating what's considered the second strongest army after the US by military analysts. The renowned Russian Army that is feared even by NATO.
Yarrrr!  It's down to Davy Jones locker with ye!
Russia will downplay this. Should be Interesting to see President Putin talking directly about The Moskva .  The Russian military will retaliate.
Denazified that ship😂😂😂🇺🇦
Another blow  against Russian aggression.  Keep fighting. Slava Ukraine..
Aah what ashame.....Not
It wasn't a sinking.  It was a Special Parking Operation near the Titanic.
I'm celebrating today!! Slava Ukraini !!
*NELSON LAUGH* HA! HA! 👉
Good,hoping the entire crew went with it.
Its now just a reef ....Slava Ukraini
It's 'sunk' a bit like the invasion has too. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣The dwarf from Moscow is a laughing stock.
Where have all the Putin bots gone?  They can't figure out how to spin this HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHa!!!!
Best news  today Ukraine pulled the plug
I don't even know what to say with the Russians, if the whole thing wasn't so tragic it would be hilarious.   It is like they have appointed John Cleese, from Monty Python to be their minister of mis-information.  The whole thing is like the dead parrot skit.
It now swims with the fishes! 😆
...and the world rejoices.
This morning I expected to see news that Mariupol had fallen. Not only was that not the case, news was that a russian flagship had been hit. By the end of the day it's now sunk. Bravo Ukraine, day after day. Slava Ukraini! 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Ukraine sinks the Moskva RatPutin sinks all of Russia
Congratulations to the  Ukrainians - the muskovar is now in its rightful place- on the bottom. To avoid further similar losses Putin needs to withdraw immediately. They have no right to be there and they will be pursued for  war crimes.
Niiiice 🇺🇦
This is a huge blow, Russia's worst naval loss since WW1.
Lol “ we thought we’d limp it across the sea to the shop”
It was Hunter Biden with his crack pipe, maybe next time he will be a little more careful!
Russia's response: "The ship didn't sink, it transformed into a submarine"
They will hurt them the most by hitting naval units
Sr putin le rompieron la nariz..vayase asu casa en paz..y respete a sus vecinos
That warship should wipe out the island before she got hit.....
Pray for all sailors
I didn’t  Sink it’s just sleeping with the fishes
The Russian Cruiser Moskva has successfully completed surface trials and now is conducting underwater operations for its classification d as a new type of submarine for  special underwater missions
It was sunk intentionally by the Russians to denazify the fish population of the Black Sea !
Russia's humiliation continues.
Sign of rapid downfall of Butcher Dynasty of Putin. Russia will collapse soon like Soviet Union. God bless Ukraine.
до свидания
That carrier of them
Theory on what happend: Some Russian guy on that ship did not like that is ship was bombing his reletives, so he took a smoke in the Ammo storage. Perfect crime, and getaway from the war. Everyone survived, including the mastermind.
Voyage to the Bottom of the Black Sea.
No it did not sink and all passengers safely disembarked after a fire
Another pollution incident the Woke green wash Germans are responsible for. I expect there were some nukes on board as well........
There’s a hole in my boat dear Putin dear Putin 🎶
"Missle Cruise Ship" :D
Missile cruise ship?  WTF?  Love Boat with rockets?
I wonder how the Russian bots are going to flip this one into a positive
Good hit
Hold on to your butt's!
sinks? fake news
It didn’t sink! It’s a very clever Russian submarine ship and totally part of the genius Putin’s plan that by the way is going exactly as predicted….
Will serve as a nice artificial reef for the sea life.
It's an old 1982 ship..and No, Ukraine didn't do it. Two missiles on this ship would have sunk it instantly..
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Russia Lies.
Excellent news hopefully the entire crew are dead
All is going to plan.  Just a special underwater submarine transformation.
It didn't sink, it went through a special water-reorganization operation
Another triumph for the mighty dictator! Slava ukraina!
mmm...nicht cruiser moskaw russian ship ?....ist sinks?...das ist sehr gut
All because a diminutive, aging, fearful-of-his-own shadow czar-wannabe is insanely jealous of a younger, stronger, Ukrainian president—a former actor, at that— whom he woefully underestimated.
I'm not sure why commentators keep noting that this ship is "forty years old."  Heck, MOST active duty navy ships are decades old!  The U.S. Navy still has active duty aircraft carriers that were launched in the 1970s!!  Big deal!  If it's on active duty, it's a military asset, and destroying it -- especially when it's serving as a fleet flagship -- is still a victory!  Slava Ukraini!
Cool, awesome, take that KGB tyrant!
Putin and his checkmate move.   Now Ukrainian are laughing so hard they can barely aim they weapons like the tik tok chechens
A real Military victory for the Russian Navy. LOL.
Huzzah!
Rusia ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Putin's biggest mistake was to broadcast to its enemies around the world how insignificant its military might really is. Soon China will be nibbling away at siberia and Muslim hordes will invade the Russian motherland.
Russians are failing faster than Trump!
so they rather lie about there was an uncontolled fire onboard, than admitting getting hit by a cruise missile..... LMFAO
Good riddance Putin
Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦 Heroyam Slava 💪
20,000 special operations under the sea.
Ooopsies...
Byee Byeee, Slava Ukraine.
Lol Russian ships always seem to be breaking down and sinking so much for modern tech army rofl
It's baffling that the most advanced and powerful Russian warship could not defend Itself from just two missiles. How is this possible? Incompetence or inferior technology?
the ship that threatened snake island was not this ship.... get the f-ing stories straight...
It was scheduled to sink on the 15th of April on the Russian military calendar and the mission was a huge success because it has gone strictly according to plan. Putin will be very proud of his men and is considering the Medal of Honor for those involved.
When I think of Ukraine fighting Russia, I think of Spartans fighting Persians.
Bye bye Moscow!
now even god is helping ukraine
Great！
How many Russians does it take to screw in a light bulb?
Sink
And what? I'm not a fan of Russia, but this is a war, men will die, planes will crash, ships will sink... or no one remembers how many UK ships were lost... by Argentina (another third-world country) during the Falkland/Malvinas Islands conflict... bahhh....
So finally this warship  he went where the  Ukrainians soldiers sent him 🤣😂🤣
After Russia's defeat, Pootin is going to tell "It was as per our plans".
Awwww.  Poor little Vlad.  His little boat was sunk.  Now all he has is his little rubber ducky to play with during bath time.
YES!!!
Moskowa said that isn t a misil from Ukrania ! It was fire by accident ...one cigarrette ? Yes ...Marlboro . Years ago the same but in the Kursk submarine ...one cigarrette ...!
its a god will..
This is all part of Putin's genius plan - that is being executed exactly as planned.
Flag ship is now no ship, good work.
Indeed.  Ammunition stores often catch fire........ AFTER the ship's been hit.
SO SAD, TOO BAD...LOL! 😢
Pray for the sailors  on that ship ... nothing worse then being locked in a burning tin can filled with toxic smoke ... thats sinking
All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them. They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them. They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.
Buhahaha
there will be Russian heads rolling after this its bitter blow
Gurgle gurgle Russia girls. 😂😂
Imagine how pissed Putin must of been when he heard about this haha
Bawhahahaha!!!! 😂
If Russia hadn't acknowledged the loss of her flag ship, all the fascistic Putin lovers would be saying: "fake news"!
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Not to be underestimated, not just a symbolic vessel but also hugely significant!  lol @Russia!
Good, Russia had the Москва there launching cruise missiles and intimidating it's neighbors for years, awesome job by the Ukrainian troops again 🇺🇦👍
Putin is crying now 😢
I think Russian were super power , but പവനായി  ശവമയീ !
May be the own russians sunk it to go home !!! they won´t die in putin´s stupid war !!!
World was Trolled by Russia #2 Military Power rankings they are being depleted by hand me down equipment from 90's and 2000's
Went undercover forever. Good job Ukraine!
Silly "fake news" propagandists!  The Moskva wasn't "sunk."  It's merely engaging in a "special underwater military operation."
Yeah.. Sabotage that's what they call it. Not from the Ukrainians.. 😂😂😂😂😂 Russians navies who supports Ukrainians.
Russia doesn't stand a chance
Womp womp 😜
I love it,  Slava Úkraina. Best vissis from Iceland
A war being perpetrated by a Boris Johnson someone has absolutely no brains at all . The UK last time I checked they were in recession and broke!! Now America and Nato has a spokesperson and the UK is it!! Nato is waging war in Ukraine and the west puppet current government has betrayed their people and allowed the west to come and tear the country apart and a massacre is unfolding and will not stop so long as the west keeps bringing in arms and threatening Russian sovereignty and security!!  Ukraine is merely a battle ground
Moskva is no more. Congrats from America. I wish our president would do more. We need Trump back.
Aawww im feeling sorry for THE Russians(NOT)
sunk like a rock full of idiots from russia, huraaaahhh
A new submarine
Western crapoganda again. The ship did not sink, it was send to a special under-water mission in support of the special military operation Mr. Putin is conducting in Ukraine! Get your facts straight, please!
Ukranian Farmers seen going to the Black Sea with Special Operations underwater Tractors
Good  keep it up
We all live in a big grey submarine a big grey submarine Slava Ukraine
More losses Russia incur then more Putin is put in corner. A cornered animal with direct access to nuclear weapons can end in something terrible.
Then let's see the pictures??? Or it didn't happen
More advance missiles are on there way from western powers.
SO Russia saying this was the result of a fire if thats the case then they have massive issues both in Russian navy morale or competence.  either way its a serious issue but truly makes no sense either.
🎯 great job 🍻
Calling a cruiser a cruise ship made me laugh.
About time brilliant news 👍
Hahahahahaha!!!
Umm, S.E.A.L.s underwater? Hmmm
It's a trick. Any minute now, Putin's going to unleash the big dogs!
Propaganda machine
🇹🇷🇺🇦
Fake news. The ship has submerged to do under water recon.🤣🤣🤣
I believe it is a sabotage....The Russian soldiers might have done something there...maybe they got drunk and throw something inside...a special military negligence
Ukraine : we hit a Russian war-ship! Russia : no! We hit our own war-ship… 😂
2 down ! How many more to go ?
Ukraine - sunk the Russian cruiser Moskva and same time with the go **** yourself postal stamp was made. 😳
Fish will have a nice playground
Very good news to Ukraine
👍Ship ahoy 🎇
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 putin🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🐁🐁🥳🥳🥳🤩🤩🤩
According to Russia it was just a fire, according to common sense a fire doesn't sink a modern warship🤷🇺🇦
It's so funny. The flag ship and pride of the Russian fleet is suggested to have been sunk by Russian incompetence... 🤣 A fire sunk a huge warship? Well, well, even if we don't believe them it really doesn't matter as long as it's one less headache for Ukraine! 😅🇺🇦🇺🇦
Putin's super flag ship sunk? 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 Now let's sink Putin!!!!!!👍😉 🇺🇦❤🇺🇦❤🇺🇦❤🇺🇦❤🇺🇦❤
So apparently the Ukrainians used a drone to distract the crew while they launched 2 Neptune missiles. Were that claimed to be a tactic against any remotely competent navy one would just laugh it off as ridiculous.  However, given the performance of Russia's land forces I find it highly believable!   What I find even more amusing is the Russians are basically claiming that the loss was just an accident. They are basically saying that they are incompetent to operate a ship without allowing it to catch fire (all on it's own) detonate it's magazine and sink.
What is phrase is worse than “FUBAR” or “cluster f&ck”?  I want comment on this.
Ukraine - sunk the Russian cruiser Moskva and same time with the go **** yourself postal stamp was made. 😳
Hilarious 😂
To bad war criminal Putin didnt sank with it
By September the Ukrainian Army will be marching on Red Square to denazifly the Kremlin.
At 68 miles off the coast this would not be visible from shore, so how could the Ukrainian s know the ship was in trouble unless they knew they had hit it with missiles.  Well done Ukrainian 👏
Return the Crimea, pay for the Ukrainian damage and loss of lives, return South Ossetia, and let Putin say he is very sorry, on his knees  on the Red square in torso and diapers.
"It is the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet..."  - was
"Slava (original name of this ship)was laid down in 1976 in Shipyard 445 of the 61 Kommunara Shipbuilding Plant in Mykolaiv"  Welcome back Home Slava 🤣
We have no navy but we will still attack and sink your ship.  This incredible.  The Ukrainian military is awesome!
👏🇺🇦👏🇺🇦🇺🇦👏🇺🇦👏👏🇺🇦🇺🇦👏🇺🇦👏🇺🇦👏🇺🇦👏🇺🇦👏
The ship has transformed to a submarine. Well done
Would like to see Putins reaction
Weren’t we supposed to follow this guy down to Gorky Park?
Maxar is taking off for Lent, or something. Just take our word for it, on the strength of various conflicting and obviously self-interested reports from various governments. I mean heck, GWB looked into Ras-Putin's eyes and saw his soul, right? Who could imagine he would stage a fictitious naval disaster by being the first ones to report it? Huh. We'll know the rest of this 'story' when a strangely familiar cruiser bearing some other name than Moskva shows up and starts shelling Odesa. Critical thinking, people. Skepticism. Consider the source, etc, etc.  Oh wait: I keep forgetting this is the Century of Stupid. It's not what we actually know, it's what we want to believe, especially when everyone else does for no particular reason and this is regarded as evidence in itself, that this brave new world's reality is made of.
Great news. Slava🇺🇦
Lol Russians can’t swim
PIT 404
Aw Too-badski comrades.  F poo-tin and his drunken conscripts
Moskva's scuttling ! Good job Vladimir...
Don't forget to take away Russia's gold medals.
The Moskva is only showing the way Moscow is heading.....
Celebrating for Ukraine! Russian warship, go ______ yourself!
So Moscow  supposed  activates the balls to fight with  Zelensky  because  Russia in war with US,  that's  the raison  any Ukrainian people  should be die for Zelensky  makes  him boss happy,  now Russia  must  up all the rest  of  Ukraine  and Sweden,  and all the rest countries  Russia  territory  had borders with.,
We proud of Putin and Russia... Long Live Russia + India Friendship
Man, what’s up ships sinking today. First it was the USS The Sullivans museum ship, next is Titanic, now this
Excellent news. 👏🏻🇺🇦
Yay 🇺🇦
Crew were assigned to Special Swimming Operation.  The Ship was reassigned to PRD.  Permanent Reef Duty.
If Ukraine ever gets a navy;......they have two kills already in the bank.
GLUB GLUB GLUB
I'm waiting for the Kremlin to announce that sinking of Moskva was also part of their plan.
Some trivia - at 12,500 tons, the Slava Class cruiser Moskva (Moscow) now becomes the heaviest/largest surface combatant sunk in battle since the Japanese fast battleship Haruna was sunk on July 28, 1945.
Flagship fall down and go boom.   Hooray!  Great news.  Russian special military operation is indeed going according to (Ukrainian) plan.  Namesake "Moscow" is pure sweet cherry pie with loads of whip cream on top.  After this the question is "will Ukrainian military let NATO join it?"  Russian military looks like Vichy French more and more.every day.
2 options why the ship sunk.  Either fire, therefore negligence, or a cruise missile from Ukraine.  Either is not a good look.
Was there any nukes on that ship by any chances?
Fantastic news ... so clever 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
It was special operation of turning a battle ship into a submarine (perhaps the biggest in the world and the only one with elaborate anti aircraft systems). It is not a loss, but rather it is just change of the ship class and it was completed strictly according to the plan. Perfectly done, let's hope we see more of these soon.
Spin that Putin.
YAH!  Another one bites the dust!  No-more killing machine,,GONE!!!
"Russians said the ship sank" Yeah!I guess 2 anti-ship missiles would do that
One can say Russia is in a bad situation. They will never admit to the ship being hit. Therefore they can not revange it. To bild a new one will cost a dollat or two.
Lol.  Russia is pathetic
Well done. Slava Ukraini.
"I follow the Moskva down to bottom park, listening to the winds of change...take me to the magic of the moment..."
Where’s the evidence?
Slava Ukraini
Nice to hear positive news about Russia losing its flagship Moscow warship .
Good news.  Let's hope the rest of their Black Sea surface fleet suffer the same fate.
🤣😅😅🤣😂 Yes
Now western media world hopes to see nuclear wespons on own nations
Great job Ukraine .... would not have sunk if Putin did not have Hitler aspirations of conquering Europe
LOL.......I busted out laughing.  putin the poisoner is really getting sunk.  He needs to LEEAVE.......LEAVE THE UKRAINIANS COUNTRY.  JUST LEAVE. BYE russia........BYE.
Slava ukraina!
India+ Russia+China+Iran are on a secret mission . India will crush the America and Europe and Israel.
Beautiful ❤️
So russia have a new submarine?
Not due to Ukraine. They don’t have the fire power, skill,  or courage.
🤣🇺🇦👍
It did not sink, check your facts.  It went to special underwater operation!
Snake Island defenders words come true. All strength to Ukraine’s defenders🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦❤️❤️❤️
Cold out there. Rumour has it sailors were warming vodka whilst hiding in the munitions storage.  The captain was reported saying WTF was that..who has stolen my Vodka! After the ammunition exploded.  Smirnoff are now advertising vodka as...so strong it can sink a battleship.
A new man made reef for sea life in Black Sea.
Freeze frame/record scratch sound effect/ Dschinghis Khan - Moskau starts playing :)))))
So either Russian incompetence or Ukrainian competence has been severely underestimated, again
I had a sinking feeling that would happen!
👍 All Russian ships has to go to the bottom of the Black Sea.
Hmmm, some of those huge missiles on the Moskva might have had nuclear warheads...We'll see if there is an extraordinary salvage operation, that would be a clue.
Hopefully it’s captain did the right thing, too.
In your eye putin.
And now Putin will blame the Ukrain for sea pollution...
Bravo Ukraine! No matter what how this invasion ends, Russia will be thrown into a dark age and will not be able to recover Economically or Militarily for a long time to come.
this is not a war, this is `a special military operation`, this is not a ship sunk, this is `a special underwater operation` 😂😂😂 Slava Ukraine 💛​💙​…
too late for Putin history has recorded your deed  it cannot be untold cheers Ukraine
Next time Ukraine can do the other way around. Distract with an incoming rocket fire and then let a group of drones drop heavy ammo on the ship. Just kidding guys. I am sure Ukrainians know best what to do. Hopefully Harpoons will give them more range.
Putin = (Kursk + Moskva) × "ona utonula"
According to Russia everything is going as planned.
Good
Photos of the massive rescue please!  This would have been an amazing feat by the rescue vessels.  In rough seas no less with a huge hole or two !
Great news! Glory to Ukraine and everyone who helped!🇺🇦🇺🇸🙏
Update by wikipedia: ⚠️Ukrainian sources say The attack was supported by TB-2 combat drones which distracted the ship’s defence systems.⚠️  Looks Like Avionic systems of Tb-2 did a huge job against air defence systems of that huge ship.🥳🎉🇹🇷
Ukraine navy has just recieved a shipment of paddle ducks  from disney land paris , and are creating  havoc with the russian blacksea fleet 😜✌
It wasn’t sunk, it change into a military submarine action wessel. Guess that’s not going to be in any Moscow aquatic military parade then.
Hussar!
Maybe this was an inside job by the Russian..... we will never know. Regardless this is a victory for the Ukraine people.
Wait till Putin sees America's new space age weapons. HE WILL FAINT, WATCH!!
What's more embarrassing for Russia? That Ukraine sunk one of its largest, and most important warships, or that Russian incompetence led to a fire that detonated ammunition magazines leading to the ship sinking.... which scenario is better Russia?🤔💀🤣🤣🤣
New submarine of the Ruzzian fleet.... 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
SLAVA UKRAINI!
Russia news. “Brave ship sacrifices itself to defeat Ukrainian Neptune missile”.😂😂😂
what a great news. The best news since Putin's war started. Putin sinks with the ship. He won't be able to survive this blow.
❤️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇬🇧🇺🇦
Let's see what happens when USA Empire invades Russia and China! I expect they will get the same treatment they got when they invaded North Vietnam and Afghanistan!
Yes!  💪🏼💪🏽🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦💪🏽💪🏼
Fake News
It’s symbolic now.
'Moskva sinks' that is all civilization world like to see.
Haha!
"The Ukrainians didn't sink our ship.  We sank our ship!"
Now that’s what I call a good days work well done our Ukraine brothers 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
this is all Zelensky's fault - if he had not stonewalled regarding the !b@i#d$e%n^ corruption in ukraine then !t@r#u$m%p& would still be president and putin would not have invaded ukraine - so as ye sow, so shall ye reap - so spaketh the Lord
Let's hope the Moskva sunk in the entrance to the port in Sebastapol, thereby sealing the port's entrance.
Wow!
Where is the prove please stop fake news
Russia a threat, REALLY????  To whom?  What a freakin joke of a military.  If it wasn’t that they have a shitload of nukes, like the USA, they would have been invaded by Afghanistan and Georgia…. Not a superpower at all, just a third world wasteland with nukes…🤣🤣🤣🤣
such a shame a wonderful and old ship has to sink :( i hope they can recover it and refloat it
That ship has not fired one shot during this war,fake BS!https://youtu.be/ANoZI3tpVmA
This is one of the supposed great Russian flagships? Apparently it was built in the early 80's during the Soviet era. Russia not so great after all
False
Win win……
The special operation continues.
Sunk? They are now saying the ship is half submarine half missile launcher!!
Sad.
NOSTRADAMUS QUATRAIN BELOW.....JUST GOING TO LEAVE THIS HERE.......I guess even in the 1500's it was known that Russia would flop this operation.  The Sun hidden eclipsed by Mercury  Will be placed only second in the sky:  Of Vulcan Hermes will be made into food,  The Sun will be seen pure, glowing red and golden.    after reading them I presented them to Vulcan. [i.e. burned them]. And while he devoured them, the flame licking the air gave out such an unexpected light, clearer than that of an ordinary flame and resembling fire from some flashing cataclysm, and suddenly illumined the house as if it were caught in a furnace.
Rather odd way to conduct underwater exploration.
I love how they distracted them with a drone lol
I hope they managed to maneuver it in the port into a very uncomfortable place to be a reef.
yeah the famouse MOkVA the biggest missile cruse ship ^_^ omg.
Allegedly
Glad to see that pile of Russian scrap at the bottom of the ocean go Ukraine 👍.
Apparently they moved the rest of their fleet out of cruise missile range- for "fire safety".
its warship from 70s not modernised that can track 5 targets a time, in comparison modern ship can 300. it was a drifting museum. I am not sure if Ukraine was lucky or not and have no idea about other ships, but hey, one ship down.
Ukrainian statements are unproven!https://youtu.be/ANoZI3tpVmA
🌻🌻🌻🇺🇦🇺🇲🌻🌻🌻
1980s called and they want their ship back lol, seriously that's a "flagship"???
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So funny an American ship just sunk in Harbor also what a coincidence
Nice habittat for fish to live in , courtesy of Russia,  SUNK BY UKRAINE 🇺🇦😀👍!! GOOD SHOOTING!!
1800 Eastern Time, the reports indicate that the ship was badly damaged, evacuated, and being towed back to port. During this time the vessel did in fact sink. The US pentagon has not independently verified the cause of the damage, but Ukraines report looks "credible" while Russian report looks "highly unlikely."  Slava Ukraini Heroyam slava!
Where is the prove stop fake news
These guys are like the bully in the class that is all muscle but no brain
Fake Ukrainian news. It was just converted into a super submarine with the super Russian engineers.... Meanwhile, Russia is burrying its first death and will start feeding the whole Ukrainian population.
Good.
Ukraine didn't sink us we did it ourselves...lol
If it was an attack it shows how poor the Russian Anti air systems Are working. If it was malfunction it shows how poor the Russian Navy is. Either way there is No way out of this one
Ukraine is showing militias, guerilla warfare works. Now the Black Sea fleet flagship Moskva has been sunk. Russian military could not have anticipated these things would have happened when they invaded Ukraine.
Game over. God bless Ukraine army.......
Hey Putin! FYI. Kitchen fires do Not sink warships.  This Russian missile cruiser sank, as the result of 2 Ukrainian Neptune missiles (similar to US Harpoon missiles).  Hooyah! This Russian warship (with 16 SS-N-12 Sandbox anti-ship cruise missiles) is no longer a threat to NATO ships, and this effectively cripples the Russian Navy in the Black Sea. Now, would be a good time to deploy (armed) drones to seek and destroy Russian amphibian ships, to prevent a beach assault on Odessa.  Hey Ukraine!  Keep-On-Winning!
They should stick to chess, cheating at the olympics and making tanks out of chocolate.
Revenge for destroying the world's largest plane!
​Слава Україні! Слава ЗСУ! Слава Залужному!

Putin will re-commission the Moskva as a SUBMARINE. They now say it just submerged and will surface at another time..Cant wait to see how the Russian people take the 20,000 dead soldiers killed in Putin's SPECIAL OPERATION in Ukraine. And the complete destruction on so many Ukraine cities by Russian troops.. Let alone the countless hundreds of WAR CRIMES committed bu Russian soldiers... No civilized nation should have any dealings with Russia..Looks more like Joe Stalin is back in charge in Moscow..
Bravo Ukrainia ...
Damn shame Putin did not go down on that ship. But glad it sunk
Saddly one of the untrained Russian navy sailors pulled out the wrong plug after taking  a bath, John paul jones will not be happy , wee have not started to sink 🙄 😑
Russia will smoke those NATO natzis back to where they came from!! This war is only being staged in Ukraine but Ukrainians stupidly fell for western trickery!! They are now just a vessel for a massacre between Russia and Nato.  The British Empire aspirations have not ceased!! But Russia drove out natzis and before and they will do it again!!
God bless Russia.
Hey guys, look! A drone! BOOM Yeah I meant to do that. All part of the plan.
Funny how all the Ukrainian infrastructural damage is caused by Ukrainians themselves, where as major Russian losses are caused by accidents.
Ok now it's time to sink their aircraft  carrier, but for that they would have to tow  it back to Ukraine.

slava UKRAINI !
That was a Special Underwater Operation by Russia to convert the War Ship into a Submarine. SLAVA UKRAINE 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦
So Russia wont admit that Ukraine sunk it, but rather admits they make warships that spontaneously combust & sink. Either way it seems like their Navy is as useless as their Army. Man, Putin must be so pissed about this.   hahahaha
Russian Media : Ship was purposely sunk due to old age :P
Was there really a storm?  Why didn't the news report inform the world the exact conditions at the time the ship sank.
Paso de crucero a modo de submarino
YES     YES     YES     YES     YES   MORE  FROM THIS      VERRY    VERRY   MORE     FROM    THIS   .            RUSSIANS              BLUB      BLUB      BLUB     BLUB     AND    BLUB   !       !      !
It is possible that it was an internal fire that caused it since Russians are not very keen on safety, this happened before couple of years ago on their carrier kuznetsov.
The ship sank exactly the same day the Titanic collided with an iceberg - April 14!
Who is afraid of the Russian military? ....not may.  Who wants to use the Russian military hardware? ....no one.  Enough said.
Russia keeps taking nothing but Ls
If it SUNK it will have a lot of company "down there" with the Russian submarines which submerged and NEVER surfaced!
Good one less ship firing missiles at civilians.
Special military operation to the bottom of the sea ,putin will say.lol❤️❤️❤️🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
bullshit, another untrusted western press
Putin medicine
Ukraine has sent Moscow a message . . . "Send more ships."
Time will show, I think, that the Moskva was indeed destroyed by fire and subsequent explosions ... The cause of the fire? Ukrainian missile strikes.
I cant swim and im so horrified for those sailors . Save those men.
The russian Navy is engaged in sub surface operations as an emergency fire fighting exercise.
Heard they towed it away but now it's sunk anyway, now that's good to hear. Guess they should have listened to that advice and go to f. themselves.  Anyway wonder how they'll sell the story at home that there was a fire, everyone fled and now they lost the vessel. And on another thought they might hold the Crimean war harbour but what if there was no more Black Sea fleet to go with it?
Slava Ukraini! 🇺🇦🇺🇦
LOL!!  Justice!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙏🏽🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙏🏽🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙏🏽🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙏🏽
⚡️Russian Ministry of Defense: The source of the fire on the cruiser "Moscow" is localized. There is no open fire. Ammunition explosions have stopped. ▪️ The cruiser "Moskva" retains buoyancy. The main missile armament is not damaged. The crew was evacuated to the ships of the Black Sea Fleet located in the area. Measures are being taken to tow the cruiser to the port. ▪️ The causes of the fire are being established.
Russia said they towed it back to port. Ah another lie.
I dropped a pebble into a glass of water and it sank.
They denied for the whole day,... nos it sunk, aha, stupid
Oh Bliss!    Surely, Surely ! The Russian public will begin now to see the writing on the wall - that Putin is a vicious  paranoid clown that makes the Russians look both murderous and ridiculous in the eyes of the World. The Russian army is f......g useless; the Russian navy is f.....g useless.
Pootie-Poot better hold onto his nukes, because the US, UK, France and the rest of NATO would make short work of any of these Russian incompetents trying to invade NATO countries.  Pootie-Poot wanted to show the world that Russia is a military force to be reckoned with, a country that cannot be ignored.  In fact, he has shown that NATO should be able to collectively handle any hostile acts or incursions by Russian forces, and given Finland and Sweden every incentive to join NATO ASAP.  This is guy is not playing 4D chess; he's playing amateur checkers, and not particularly well.
Every sports team (especially after they played really bad): "We played really well, but the opponent was just incredibly strong today."  Russian military (after they got a really devastating blow): "The enemy wasn't involved at all, we were just too stupid to handle our own ship."
lol nice
horosho
Good.
I hope Russia sees sense and remove there leader
kkkkkkkkkkkkk.  VERY  GOOD  UCRANIA.
How Sweet It Is!
Putin: WHO SANK MY BATTLESHIP ??!!!
The whole argument about the fire breaking without Ukrainian action only makes the Russians look bad. Think about it. A fire breaks in the ship and it manages to blow up a magazine...a fire, on a warship, and it manages to blow up a magazine! How is that the better option than saying that "Yes the Ukrainians hit our ship."  Russian Navy looks like its service members are nothing but Beatle Baileys!
I haven't heard anyone previously refer to the Russian flagship as 'largely a symbolic presence' in the Black sea, quite the opposite in fact.
Fake News the Russian Terrorist Ship has Been converted to be a Submarine
Viva Liberty....Viva  Ukraine....russians always lie......Russia will be isolated for many years......russia as a world power is over.....i think even there nuclear weapens do not work.....
What a shame it did not have Russian vessels, port and starboard, refueling the flag ship Moskva.( that would  be a scene even  i would pay sky tv for)
Best news of the day!!!!
Putin made a statement telling how he had spoken to the ship’s captain and he’d told putin that “ everything was lies an.. blub blubb blubbb blubbb blub blubbb blub “ but the phone connected was lost comrades
When the ship developed a problem Russians said the rockets on board were not damaged; I'm happy for them. Maybe they won't leak any dangerous substance into the see
Part of the anger from the Water God
Glow little glow worm, glow  Thanks to Russia for remembering our memories.   Bing Crosby https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfPVSPnxqJs
As said on another site... these war ships are becoming obsolete... sitting targets for drones without any protection they are now sitting ducks....
I support a FREE Ukraine, Strong and Proud, Slava Ukraine. another step toward victory
If it was a flagship it would have an admiral on board. Was that the case?
Hahaha  Drone distraction.  2, not 1 Neptune missiles hitting Russian MOSKVA & sinking Russia’s fleet flagship, not a ship fire.  Russian Navy is a JOKE !!!! Russia can never stand up to NATO’s Naval FORCES. Hahahahahaha!!!!
Well Russias powerful army and fleet havnt done much have they
Conveniently sank before anyone had a chance to see the two large holes on it’s side.
putin is so clever, converting a cruiser to a sub is a master stroke. i just hope some underwater ukrainian tractor doesnt find it!
MOSKVA HAS SUNK
Congratulations Ukraine x  1 sunk, 3 of that class of ship left to hit.
Russian people 🇸🇮 WAKE UP! ,  Putin is  economically destroying your country and Your Sons, Dads, Brothers,Uncles are  fighting and Dying in Ukraine for what ????
Hoorah,  Hoorah,   Hoorah.   and nobody died?
Wonder if it cost as much as his yacht.
SLAVA UKRAINA
Victory to Ukraine! As terrible as the war suffering is, Ukraine armed forces are covered in glory, go Ukraine heroic defense of your country! Courage!
THE "FLAG" SHIP?. I HOPE THE NEXT TARGET WIIL BE "THE KREMLIN" . AH!
HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!
Hahaha
That is amazing. Ukraine is badass.
The Great Russian Navy Reef of the Black sea☺️ if Russia didn't have nukes they would be very very worried now😂
Did the flagship Moskva carry any nuclear warheads? Did they go down with the ship?
Is Russian incompetence sinks own flagship better than Russian flagship sunk by enemy missiles? Apparently so, in Moscow.
Foreshadowing for its namesake. Belly up!
And That's A Good Thing!
How can Russia let a important ship sink like this? Didn´t the ship had incomming warning system and counter missile systems. Can the Russian navy really be sunk that easy?
Moscow the Ship...sunk. Moscow the City...listing.
What has happened to us. We are citizens of this planet , and we are killing our own people. And destroying our planet . We should all be deeply ashamed.  Instead we just watch it happen . Shameful !!!
Ya best news ever
I swear the russian generals are trying to demilitarise themselves as a covert way to get rid of putin, no way are they actually this laughably incompetent to lose 8 ships including their 2 biggest ones to a country with NO NAVY
Is this how Russia is kicking off their next offensive?😂
Nice
Someone is going to be very upset tonight
I'm not sorry
👍
TASS, which is also state owned, said the fires had been stopped and the ship was at Port. So please, clear that up for us since sky news rarely ever quotes Russian state-owned media
Its a war.  The better of the two succeed.  All are losers.  Russia has already lost this War.  Putin miscalculated and will forever be known as a failure and tyrant that never was.  And, that's good.
Great news!!!
Wanna buy a pile of titantium and steel, cheap?  Don't mind the irradiation.
It is a shame that there were survivors.
Putins latest submarine.
Now It’s the good old useful Russian state owned media 😅
Black Sea needs urgently some sharks imports. Plenty of inhumane food .
I guess the result of investigation will be some sailor smoked in the wrong place and caused a fire that sunk the ship.😛
Congratulations Ukraine!! 🇺🇦
Sunk?  It probably flipped over and was unstable when towed.   What the heck do the satellite images report? We gotta stop speculating.  We don't need no stinkin' Russian comments.  Satellite. 2022, not Russian 2000.
Russia should give up now to avoid further embarrassment.
How can it be sank and toed back the black sea is deep lol
Lolol
RESPECT.. Stay strong Ukraine.. Greetings from Denmark. 👍
this news likely to break heart many in indonesia (with their sympathy to russia + chechnya)
Repeat and repeat and repeat until all Russian warships, tankers and supply ships become artificial  reefs and their  crews become fish food.
Sunk yet towed back lol
Why do they repeat the same exact things 3 times?
I bet they sank it so that the public wouldn't see the damage from the two Ukraine missiles.
¿Videos, Photos?...
Wonder if the Russians are lying to keep the flagship as a "surprise asset".
Excellent that's one soviet Era relic down, now the other one (putin) must sink into a long drop also.
lol...excellent
40 year old flag ship, lol.
Definitely the ship was sunk moments after the attack, but Kremlin guys were waiting for the VAR check.
Little Vlad is going to send a missle into downtown Kiev in retaliation
Ukrainian tractors are a bit sad that they didn't take this one :(
Nuclear fireworks.  Ship soon to glow 24x7.
That Russian warship f**ked itself.
🇺🇦👌💪💪💪💪👍👍👍👍
It was not sunk, it was towed back.
According to the Russians the Black Sea is recognized as an extremist body of water, searches are underway for the organizer of the storm)
In all actuality it has been redeplyed on a "SPECIAL UNDERSEA OPERATION" for an unspecified amount of years.  SLAVA UKRAINE 🇺🇦 ♥ FROM NYC
Note from jealous admiral to Ukraine: please leave at least one Russian ship for me to sink.
SLAVA UKRAINA!!! 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦 HHHUUU AAAHHH!!!
Selfish coward NATO
Special ship, special day, and even more special missal. Well done Ladds. Slava Ukraine...
Was there nuclear weapons on board?
Well, it's a shame such a storied vessel had to go like this.  Ships have their own stories & lives, irrespective of what flag they sail under.  This is 1 less threat Ukraine has to worry about, & that's a GOOD thing.  But a fine ship died today, & whether it was Ukrainian missiles or Russian negligence, this is another failing to lay at the feet of Vladimir Putin.  Random observation - apparently, Putin is willing to trash anything & everything in his maniacal obsession with Ukraine - troops, Russian citizens, historical treasures - all sacrificed to his over-inflated ego.
This is huge defeat to russians as they are dreaming they are the best army in the world. Even more this is extreme shame to them, the same scale of defeat they had only 110 yes ago in battle with Japan. Not just reputational loss but loss of ~400 men and the biggest warship in the Black sea.
According to Putin, it is actually being repositioned to join the submarine fleet.
I love a good metaphor.
“Mokva “ is actually very good 😀 To be more precise - Moksha. This is the name of a big ethnic group where current Moscow city was founded. Now they call themselves Russians for some strange reason.
🤣😀😂🤣
I love the Russian PR on this. "Do not be absurd, Ukraine could not sink our ship. We sank it ourselves!"
VICTORY TO UKRAINE!!!!!!!!!!
Harpoon job
Ukrainians: we sunk it Russians: NO NO NO NO! I KILL ME!
it didn't sink, it's just a Special Titanic Operation
Moskva can have all the fish în black sea
They went and they f##ked themselves lol
GLORY UKRAINES 🇺🇦
Shouldn't move it
Great work! Another nail in Putin's coffin!
Well it was a Soviet era ship, 40+ years old, probably riddled with rust. Easy enough to turn into a submarine. But even so, Slava Ukraini.
Hiding chemical weapons
Slava Ukraine
Speciaĺ operation Hha Slava Ukraine
That's a nice artificial coral reef.
It's supposed to do that, it's on a special submarine hunting mission.
No, there were no missiles. This 40 years old ship had a fire and sunk during this war by mere coincidence. The fire and the battle have nothing to do with each other. That's why it went under water on purpose to extinguish the fire with the massive amount of water on top if it.
The video is online, the explosion was massive!!!!
It didn't sink. Putin was secretly training his sailors to be combat divers. They're finishing their qualifications now.
Most ships only get 20 years so it served its country well.
It has not sunk! It has just  temporarily ceased to float .
Actually the cook left the borscht on the fire too long and it caused the fire which the only liquid available to put out the fire was vodka.
There will be a severe punishment for Ukraine as result I'm sure.
Sabaton must be loving this, so much material!
JAja JAja how is these news 📰 jajajjaajjajjajajjajjj
Two F-117 night hawks, pride of USAA, shot down 1999. near Belgrade and?
Can it fly a flag underwater  ? President Puto,  loser 🤣 From  Great Britain
"Run silent, run deep". No, this saying is not about a submarine, but about "Moskva". Slava Ukraina !
Haha
That's where Putin belongs... The bottom of the sea.
it's actually a proto-type multi use submarine/ship those ruskies are so far advanced with their military vessels  , I also seen a helicopter submarine as well , it just flew from the sky to the sea in seconds
putin is basically killing his own people now. watch out trolls.
✊👏👏👏👏👏✊
I hope it sung. Good riddance. Many Ukrainian people will not be harm in the near future.
And with this news God is well pleased.Now blow up St Petersburg wouldn't that get there attention.War would end toot sweet
Thank God 🙏 and praying for more victory over this mad man
Russia:  It didn't sink, it became a submarine.
Russia denying the ship being hit by Ukraine as if the on-board fire was a brave thing! Now they have one more submarine! Slava Ukraine!
It is a big target after all. I bet aircraft carriers wont survive long in real world war.
👏👏👏👏👏👏
Hope the ukraine army can recover some weapons and have evidence of weapon of crime.
C-4, D-4, E-4, F-4...You sank my battleship!
Nationwide is on your side 🤡🤣🤡
Smart thinking of Ukraine: Without ships, the Russians have no need for Crimea anymore. Problem solved.
SCORE!! Way to go Ukraine!!!
Sunk that ship is a great victory and good news for Ukraine 👍👍👍✌️
Для Запада это проблема. Ужасный враг оказался сделан из фанеры и скотча. На кого теперь списывать военный бюджет? После Афганистана?
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🎽🎽🎽
Sweet.
💙💛💙💛 *Slava Ukraine!* 💛💙💛💙
Literally made my day, well done guys, what's next?
Aren't there any satellite image that could show evidence of this ship being hit or weren't there any satellites over that area at the point of any incident?
The Moskva is now valiently attacking the bottom of the Black Sea. Slava Ukraini, heroyam slava!
она утонула.
Russian military good at marching at parades, not so good at waging war.
Wonderful to see it gone.These ship's have rained missile's on innocent civilization
According to Turkish Fishing Boat which came to the rescue of Cruiser Moskva,  Moskva sent out SOS to all ships (which indicates it was desperate, otherwise it would only contact Russian navy ships), via Morse Code, not verbal communication. When Turkish fishing vessel came to the rescue around half hour later they got the message, the Moskva was already leaning dangerously, with fire and smoke coming out, and they were only able to pick up 54 Russian sailors already in the water, and the Moskva sank soon after.
Erm… correction.. it WAS the flagship of the Soviet fleet
Russia. Tired of winning yet???  Slava Ukraini!!!  🇺🇦 🇦🇺
Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō (Japan's hero who destroyed the Russian Fleet at the Battle of Tsushima 1905) approves
Russia has been trying to attack European countries like germany since ancient Greek times. Hitler was Russian and in 1814 Russia Invaded France and almost killed Paris france. Glory to Azov battalion and Aidar battalion.
Shut up if no real story
Have heard of the story? its less than a day. blub blub now a new reef.
Russia aren't very good at wars are they.?
good
Great news!! Sink all of the Russians ships!
They told them to f*ck off so they did...
I soooooo hope this is true, I do not care if it was Ammo exploding (shows how badly trained the crew were) or if it was hit by missiles. Either way Ukraine is a bit safer.  Such a shame the crew got off.
And the parade on 9.5 is getting closer. Vladolf Vladimirovich Putler already feels sorry.
"The Russian Moskva Cruise ship" 😆🤣😂
Surely thr russian forces must be on the verge of mutiny now tens of thousands dead column after column after column of tanks wiped out ships sunk and helicopters downed and all this after just 7 weeks!
There is nothing more pleasing right now than how embarrassing Russia's military is.
We have been continuously asking the Ukrainian government on our postings to stop the flow of Russian gas to the EU. Do not back down on this an be fearful of an European backlash. Western Europe will support and understand. The Macron conundrum will not be impacted by doing this either. France is ambivalent with regards Russia whoever is in power but impacting the supply of gas will focus a tighter level of support as it demonstrates a position of strength and it negates the notion of ambiguity and naivety.   Also we are pleased that finally after continuously calling for an attack on the Black Sea fleet that it appears that a focused attack may have been finally undertaken by the Ukrainian forces today of the Russian Black Sea fleet flag ship. Official confirmation is awaited l but as we have continuously stated this is a strategy which will impact Russia massively. It must be coordinated and implemented.
Russian president Putin has now commenced a "Special Underwater Operation" in the Black Sea.
Great news 😂😂😂
ha ha, so sad for the Little putin. He is such a fool.
So they put a mosquito in their ear then whacked them on the head with a meat tenderizer. Well done Ukraine 🇺🇦
Special maintenance operation
What better way to test of the new Neptune rocket after all they painted that nice target for them to aim for
🇺🇦🥳
XD They may be happy destroying entire cities, but their situation is becoming a bigger and bigger dumpster fire every day. They can say what they will to their people but someday all those remaining soldiers, and families of the dead ones that Russia failed will be coming home. Not sure how they will shut up that many angry mouths.
Missile debris pieces found: White lettering says " FROM HOSPITALS"
Pity the mass murderer Putin wasn't aboard.
There's something off about this war and it's coverage.
Lol...more propaganda boring.
The Russian lady is only overloaded with sea water.
On one had if it was an accident, it shows poor design, maintenance, training, and leadership.  The Moskva was sailing in a storm and not in active firing mode, so there was a very slim chance for a fire to start in a weapon magazine.  On the other hand, if the Ukrainian Neptune cruise missile, which was developed by Ukraine, struck the Moskva during a storm and the Moskva was unable to detect or defend it’s self, it shows badly on the Russian navy.  If the Russian missile cruiser Moskva sinks by either an accidental fire in the ship’s magazine or by a hit by Ukraine’s Neptune cruise missile, which was developed by Ukraine, it’s a devastating blow to Russia.
👍🇺🇦✌️
The first casualty of war is truth
Putin is Genius😂 quoting another  🧞‍♀️
Slava Ukraine  From indonesia
A lot of munitions to the bottom of the sea…
Russians make a lot of junk. Tanks, ships, planes all junk!
Good riddance
Brilliant 👏🏻
Glory and Victory to Ukraine
Oh well.   They got more to go under.  No problem
Na zdrowie 🖕
Sounds like BS considering Russian media are banned from everywhere and everything. If the Ukranians did sink it you'd think they would have footage from their drone!
Glory To Ukraine 🇺🇦 Truth And Democracy Are Worth Fighting For 🗽
Russia sinking
Based on newly reported information, the Russian Defense Ministry has now retracted it's previous statement about a fire.  It has been found that a sailor accidentally pulled the plug from the bottom, sinking the ship.
I'm glad to hear that Ukraine sync more ships of Russia
Strage that it was on the way back
Sink all Russian war ships.
Slav killing Slav, Orthodox killing Orthodox. The others are cheering and rejoicing.
Ukraine Strong 💪🏁 🇺🇦
Judging by the photo, the flagship had no CIWS turrets. Practically a sitting duck by today's standards.
Why would they sail a missile cruiser so close to shore? It just seems like a huge risk. No ship in active service has the armour to properly protect it when in such close proximity.
Keep it up boys!!! Slava Ukraine! 💪🇺🇦🗽🇨🇦💪
Russian military is  as weak as joe Biden.  DEATH TO RUSSIA
😂
It transformed to a submarine
Well see if their "I need my cake portion" Special Operation  turns back to "I don't like cake so much". This might be as ferocious as desperate a war. But what a shame !!! This will be a special chapter of human history for sure, if anyone survives that.
Esto es lo q necesitaba. Ucrania !!  …Slava Ukrania! ….
And now that Turkey has closed the entrance to the Black Sea, they can't bring in a replacement. Russia does have plenty submarines though. An interesting thought is just how close Sevastapol is to mainland Ukraine, I wonder if it's within reach of Harpoon for those ships entering and leaving port.
The humiliation continues, wow.
Not true. The ship didn't sink. It's just going through a special subversive maneuver, after detecting a 🇺🇦 subtractor 12 feet below.
Gotcha
"The Russians say the ammo went on fire." It was due to Ukrainian ammo hitting it!
Russian   warship have    underwater  disappearece    capability   .  The    china   too    .they  can  perfome   super  quick    disapear    tech.
The Moskva has not sunk the Black Sea is simply conducting a special marine operation inside and around the ship.
God bless Ukraine good wins over evil
Please be true! 🤞  🇺🇦
Good.
Russia is already turning the sinking of their ship as a victory, claiming a new submarine was just added to its fleet...
Purge of naval personnel on the way?
This is Russia's naval wake up call
many countries bodering the black sea are going to send in divers to go after what's still on that ship.
Woohoo! Sink baby sink!
Sunk just like Putins greedy dreams
Oh dear, what a shame. Mr Putrid must be very angry!  :-)  :-)
TAKE THAT POOTIN!!!!!
Hard to say what happened here.  I tend to believe the Ukrainians much more, but I _do_ realize I've begun to have the predilection that when I see a Russian spokesman's lips move I assume that there's a lie coming out.  I mean they've got to tell something approximating the truth sometimes, right?
Nothing says Damage control like “Every man for himself!”
Gotta laugh, Russia said the ship sunk because of bad weather and  a fire. Give me a break, even the Russian people can’t fall for that bull.  Way to go Ukraine military. 👍👍👍👍👍
Great news
Sunk just like Putin's dreams. Haha!
Just like all of there other military hardware. Junk.
Pray for Ukraine, as the response to this will be viscous, at a guess I would say that Odessa will be levelled, or the use of chemical weapons or worse will be authorised.
Russia sure is succeeding in many special operations in this war
So it has sank..like lead it has reached the bottom of the ocean. Tell Russia send another one . Putin is having some real restless nights- he's in a monkey pants 🐒 because forks have been throwing monkey 🐒 wrench into the Russian engine. Goodwill and prosperity is against him and his nation at this moment.♥️
Delightful !!!!!
Russian propaganda: warship "consolidating" at lower levels.
Moskva actually mean MOSCOW
GOOD!..DONT WANNA GET BURNED THEN GET THE F**K OUT!.
russia is a third world country, slava Ukrainie
Lol
Go Ukraine Go. Putin needs this . If the man was smart he would stop this war HE started.
"Symbolic presence", oh right. Typical Sky News absurdly inaccurate reporting.
Putin says everything is going according to plan.
lol lol lol lol  totally a  special operation
RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA: "It was lost in a storm, and damaged due to ammunition exploding."  UKRAINE: "Yeah, our ammunition exploded alright, right into the MOSKVA!"  THE WEST: "And all of those hundreds of Russian tanks that have been flipping their turrets, that was just due to some "ammunition exploding" too. LOL!
Wonderful!❤️
Excellent news for the free world and our Ukraine heroes.
Recalling Ricky Martin's tune She bangs which sounds like She sank, She sank, lah-lah-lah
This fantastic news. Was Putin on board? Ah I forgot he got a job at Moscow Circus as a clown.
How would u like to be called to the “principal’s office” to explain to Putin WHY Russia’s flagship is now an artificial reef.
Special Operation: Finding Nemo
A divine wind finished it off! 5000 love 💘!
😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Russia has a new 💦submarine💦👌🏼😄
It would t surprise me that either the Russians f’d something up or the Ukrainians blew it up.
The Moskva is  de-Nazifying  the fish's  at the bottom of the sea .
🙏🙏🇺🇦
Sink a few more of such warships! Pride of puitin poked from all sides. Victory to Ukraine 🇮🇨
LOL Russia will blame it on biden, says biden launched the neptune missle
ROFL Russias pride of their Black sea navy is at the bottom of the sea. Slava Ukraine!
Russian lied
Great shot Ukrainians!!! 🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯
A la Nelson Muntz: 'Ha ha!'
The Kremlin have have hit back at the fake news of their Battle Cruiser Moskva being destroyed.    They are now saying that Moskva has gone under the sea on a on a special operation hunting for Ukrainians...
regardless of how it sunk...RUSSIANS ARE ROOKIES with NAVAL POWER....WHOOP WHOOP
Victory go to hell Putin
40 year old USSR ship. The flagship..... Like.... WTF Russia??!? No wonder most of your fleet is rotting and rusting away, at the dock's.
Ukrainian Missiles or Ship sinking over its weapons starting a fire on board? Putin's arrogance and pride taking a humongous battering.
A victory for corporations that sell war machines.
Cue Farewell the Rocky mountains for the 🚀 sinking 🚢
💥💥💥MORE NEWS LIKE THIS 💛💙👏👏👏🇺🇦💙👏💛🌻🌻🇺🇦💙👏💛DEFEND YOUR LAND UKRAINE 💛💙👏🇺🇦💛🌻👏SLAVA UKRAINI
Lol just another propaganda news😂 thats why they can’t show the footage of the sinking ship🤣🤣🤣
Slava Ukraini!
BYE FELICIA!
I'm just surprised that Russia didn't deny ever having a cruiser named 'Moskva' and anyway, it was never in the Black Sea.
It didn't sink it just turned in to a submarine
Ótimo 👍 🤭
nice
Sure it was a russian caused fire just like russians are not killing civilians in Ukraine.
We have know idea what is going on behind the scenes face it
Slava Ukraine
Both can be true.  The magazine blew up because it got hit by a missile.  And not just a symbolic presence.  The S300s it carried were providing air defense over the southern area of operations.
Fun Fact: Today is the 110th anniversary of the Titanic's sinking
Glory Ukraine 😀😀👍👍🇺🇦🇺🇦
Not sure why we're so eager to swallow anything the Russian state media outputs. They've such a great track record with truth.
Well done ✅ Ukrainians!
So freaking cool! Love u too Russia....
That looks expensive and time consuming to build
This is a major blow to Russia. This was one of their most prominent ships. Anatoly Nogovitsin said that this one ship could sink the navies of the entire world by itself, in a single volly. Lolololololol. Too bad he's not alive to grieve it's untimely sinking.
The Russian warship Moscow did not sink. It is on a Special Visit With Davy Jones Locker Operation.
Absolutely splendid news. Regards from Belfast, N.Ireland. The home of NLAW and Starstreak.  Slava Ukraini. 🇬🇧🇺🇦
Nyet ! Russia has invented Claoking device. Kapla !
Best place for a Russian ship is the bottom of the Black Sea.
👏👏👏👏GLORY TO UKRAINE 🤣👏👏👏🇺🇦💙🇺🇦💛🇺🇦💛🌻🇺🇦💙💛🌻SLAVA UKRAINI 💙🇺🇦🌻💙🇺🇦🌻💛👏🌻👏💙💙🇺🇦👏👏👏🌻💛🇺🇦
3 down, 5 to go.
That's what they get for starting a war with a country with modern weapons. The arrogance and outright stupidity the Russians have displayed is astonishing. They got what they deserved.
The ship has been reassigned for a special military operation, under water.
Glory to Ukraine!
The ammo caught on fire... how did the fire start? I'd rather say the Ukrainians sunk it than blame it on poor engineering  lol
Now an underwater reef
It is time for Putin's inner circle to put him out of the worlds misery.  Putin dreams of being Julius Cesar but he has become a Hitler wanna be!
Wonderful! 👏wonderful! 👏 opera voice comes in!!! Applause 👏
Slava Ukraine!!  🇺🇦
On land, on sea and in the air Russia is sh1t.
That's sad a total waste of beautiful hi tech boat ruined by the Ukrainians
Let's supply 1000 cruise missiles to the Ukraine to take care of the rest of the fleet and Sevastopol with no loss of life of course.
Russia is playing mind games there's no clear evidence as to what happened, even BBC is assuming, they are not being factual, thus misleading the people especially fools. Ever heard of an Eastern hognose snake?
So either incompetence....or a Ukrainian victory....your choice Vlad.
I don't think that was a good idea.  The last think then Ukrainians want to do is piss Putin off. I think its only a matter of time before he looses is temper. Then god help everybody. including the yanks.
Good work Ukraine,GOD BLESS FREEDOM.
It sank at 0200 last night, old news💙💛
Just let that sink in. That's Putin it to them. Encore! Encore! Slava Ukraini. 💥
Good work, Ukraina
I don't know why Russia would claim it caught fire and exploded, that just makes the Russian navy look like a bunch of boobs who sunk their own ship.
Very nice one...
Now known as Kursk-II.....
Oh well. Whaddya gonna do?
There will be more warships and hopefully they get sunk, too. Sympathy to the sailors.
Bants
HaHa! Losers!
The ship has been withdrawn from surface operations to focus on clearing up the seabed.
Good news!!! These Ukrainians are going to win that war. 💪🇺🇦
Sad sad and sad people are dying.from this conflict.both Russian people and Ukraine people..the year 2022 and we are still not civalized to the point were war doesn't need to happen.will we really ever learn.or is it just our species'that we destroy and kill.be be eachother or earth itself and it's other life form's..it's like earth isn't our home.maybe all of the human race needs to be ended.and maybe a newer more earth loving intelligent creature can develop.
Excellent news
it is currently under temporary retrofit operation
40 years old….hmmmm….what is that in human years?   The old lady is at the bottom of the Black Sea now, a reef for the fish…..?  Wow, have not seen anything impressive by RUSSIA yet…..wonder if they will actually start to act like a strong country or just continue to fake it?  Sounds like all they can do is shoot at civilians because they don’t carry weapons….pretty lame RUSSIA…damn.
great news!!
🇷🇺 holding back
🤘.. hell yeah..  that spontaneous combustion ammo is not to play around with , it packs some serious punch.  Maybe they should switch over to just plain old regular boring ammo ?. Just to be safe ...  🤣
From ship to submarine, courtesy of Ukraine.
thats the same footage from the island  bullshit
Oldest trick in the book and yes the Russians fall for it hook line and SINKER 🤣🤣 Ukraine with love 💙🙏
We've seen their paper army and their navy doesn't look much better.
Fortune favours the brave.
Soon, the world's evil dictators won't know who to fear more, the Israelis or the Ukrainians!
Nice!
it was Symbolic HIT Firstly name "Moskva" secondly it was sunk on the Titanic Anniversary....
I bet POS Putin will tell Russian the ship is doing a "special military operation" at the bottom of the sea 💩 #SlavaUkraini🇺🇦🌻
becoming pretty expensive this special operation...
Russians should go home
blubb blubb. Warum war der Feigling Putin nicht drauf
nice shots.
This will be a huge morale boost, well done Ukraine...
If it truly sank!!!! GLORY to Ukraine
Im sure Russia have another Ship , to take it's place .
How is the "special" operation going Putin?
Too bad it sunk before anyone got proof of Ukraine's missile strike on it.  Oh Oh Oh I see....
They didn't have the John Deere Farm-Tractor Hotline phone number??? They could have been redirected to the Off-Shore call center in the East-India facility of the Amphibious Division!!!
Sink! Sink! Sink!
Yeeeessss! Awesome
SLAVA UKRAINI
Oh dear never mind😂😂😂😂😂😂
How many missiles did the russian flag ship launch onto Ukraine civilians during the last month?
Anchors away, commies.
The new commander “Butcher of Syria” is definitely bringing some changes to this war. The sinking is a welcome present to him.
"Missile cruise ship"? Who's selling "cruise" tickets? Norwegian Cruise Lines, perhaps?
Thats some good news!
Russian ship... Chinese components!  Not a surprise really that it couldn't intercept a pair of relatively slow flying cruise missiles.
Lmao if Ukraine had the goods they could invade Russia
Due to careless smoking by russian sailors.
Best place for it
This must be part of the Ukraine Special Military Operation to de-militarize Russia.
If there wasn't so much death and destruction, Russia's military incompetence would be hilarious. The clowns in the Police Academy movies would be a more disciplined and efficient military force.
It would be a Befitting Outcome if the Ukrainian Military pushed the Pro-Russian Separatists and the Russian Military out of Eastern Ukraine across the border into Russia. I wish Continued Good Luck to the Ukrainian Military with their Current and Future Efforts to destroy Every Piece of Russian Military Equipment that occupy Ukrainian Territory.
Yes! Severe damage by Ukrainian missiles was already great, sinking it is the icing on the cake. Further blow to Russian morale
Ha, ha, ha..!
May more Russians ships follow similar sinking operation, as well on land. Slava Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine.
Doesn’t matter if it’s 40 years old ship, the ship was used to kill many people.
RUSSIA DO NOT NEED BLOCK CONFRONTATION LIKE USA AND THEIR PUPPETS EU THEY DO IT ALONE, ALL HAIL RUSSIA
Ce soir, Champagne pour moi afin de trinquer à cette belle victoire Ukrainienne et à ce magnifique cadeau qui est fait aux poissons des profondeurs, qui vont pouvoir se reproduire  tranquillement dans l'épave du Moskva!  Bravo aux héros combattants Ukrainiens pour ce grand fait de guerre!
The price of Russian aggression.... Long live and God bless Ukraine!!!
It was redeployed to the bottom of the Black Sea to distract the Ukrainians.
It's all going according to plan!
Slava Ukraini !!!!
The loss of the Moskva is a catastrophic military defeat and absolute humiliation for Russia. It is better for Russia to capitulate as soon as possible, before they are even more embarrassed in the world. What a shame for Russia. 1. It is a flagship. 2. Bears the name of the capital of Russia, which is a significant symbolism. Full support from Croatia. We hope Ukraine has already begun planning Operation Storm to regain its territory Luhansk, Donetsk and Crimea.
Moskva (Sunk by Ukraine in Ukraine War) Displacement	12,490 tons Length	186.4 m (611.5 ft) ______ General Belgrano  (Sunk by UK in Falklands War) Displacement	9,575 tons (empty) 12,242 (full load) Length	608.3 ft (185.4 m)
The Black Sea will be a graveyard for the Russian fleet. The Moskva is now on station doing Reef duty. Slava Ukraine! 🇺🇦 🇺🇸
Nice one. Killer machine aimed to kill innocent ukrainians.
Here's the truth about Ukraine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-UJ8S63Tsw
It's too bad the crew was mostly able to disembark, it would have been better if all hands were lost!  Is that a bad thing to say?  Yes it is, but under the circumstances, 100% justified!
This is the demilitarization of Ukrainian missiles by russian ship, everything is according to plan
Hip,Hip,Hooray!!! 💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛
BS ppl. Wake up ppl. Zero proof ppl. Oh... wait... its on the news... its gotta be true.
Idiots be like:
Strange how the mainstream media reports how; "Ukraine has claimed..." and; "Russia states/reports....." when talking about this war.
Glory to Ukraine!) 💚🇺🇦✌️
Good job, Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!!
Too bad Putin was not on board.
Admiral Kuznetsov next....
Slava Ukraine...
Did it sink with nuclear weapons on board?
"Symbolic presence" makes it sound as if this ship wasn't that important. It was THE most important ship of the Black Sea fleet, given the midlife updates, the fact that it was from the Soviet era is as irrelevant as the fact that some of the USAF B-52's are from the 1960's. So, its significance is far bigger than "just" symbolic. The symbolic part is the Snake Island incident, the militairy significance lies in the specific role of the Moscva toward the other ships of the Black Sea fleet, like providing air cover etc. The main experts of the BSF were on board of the Moscva, so it had a bit the function of floating command post.
Ukrainians, your valor and courage will always be remembered in the history books!
Lmao
sink the rest.
well done Ukraine, Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Is claiming your sailors are so incompetent they blew up their own ship really better?  Slava Ukraini
It didn't sink, it was transformed into a submarine by the Ukrainian army
Well they aren’t wrong when they said the ship destroyed 2 missiles 😂😂😂😂
Slava Ukraini
They will blame it on the same iceberg that sank the Titanic.
It did not sink BEHOLD OUR BATTLECRUISER/SUBMARINE : Russian Defense Ministry
Bloody brilliant!
I wouldn't like to be the messenger to tell Mad Vlad that the Moskva is now down under with the Kursk 🇺🇦 🇪🇺 💪
down down down to Davey Jones Locker
Sink in hell
It was definitely a 117 year old Japanese torpedo boat which sank the Moskva. Ask the Kamchatka.
Well done Ukraine!
Next...
This has already been debunked as a 2 year old video from a test. Come on people, wake up to this propaganda!
Beautiful Ukraine 🇺🇦 more ship want to sink  Must have cost lot money to build wasted what a waste but no more of the people who lost their life  Neal  is compare to that lost  Ship can be rebuild houses but not life
Haha glory to Ukraine
"Russian ship, go sink yourself! " 😁
Black sea barrier reef as started hopefully Ukraine will had to it VICTORY TO UKRAINE
Bwahahahaha! This sends a nice little warning to China too.
I can't believe MSM narrative.
Great news!!! Sink them ALL.
The russians will say it dident sink it just became a submarine 💛💙😁
Nice!
News flash in Moscow. "The Moskva has not sunk."
The Russian claims that this was due to a fire and not a Ukrainian attack is laughable. Ammunition is stored in armored, fireproof compartments, an accidental fire on a ship wouldn't cause such destruction.
Lol.  Anything coming out of isa and western media is suspect
Wiw
Supporting russia 🇷🇺  Glory to Russia
Russian warship went naxui
Glory to Ukraine Good job 👍❤️
Damm u sunk there battship 🥇🚢 my Ukrainian brother's gotta love them bad asses. Slava Ukrania 🇬🇦💪 🇵🇷🙏
Nice!
Accidental special fire operation
Truth always wins ,   By by Vladimir
In memory of all the innocent people who died in Syria and Ukraine by this so called “flagship”
Putin “we have special technology to convert to submarine “
In 1969 my VP-23 aircrew took a photo of another soviet ship "Moskva", a helicopter carrier at Antikithra anchorage west of Crete..  I guess they scrapped her.  Some where I have pictures of her that I took.
Yup, "the fire was under control", as the Russian bloke said this afternoon, I guess once it started sinking it did stop burning. The latest lie is that it sunk while it was being towed to port. The other way of saying that is that it sunk before they could tow it back to port. Either by gross incompetence or by way of a 30-year-old, subsonic Neptune missile attack. in both cases, nothing to be proud of. This war is extremely bad publicity for the Russian arms industry. China and a couple of other countries might be having second thoughts right now.
Take that Putin ! 🚀 ⛴
Row Row Row your Boat OH Sorry IT Sank :)
Puthler: Alexandr Dvornikov...! In the office, NOW!   🇺🇦 🇺🇦 SLAVA UKRAINI! 🇺🇦 🇺🇦
"Sunk in stormy weather".... Hear that Vlad? Sounds like a metaphor!
Karma ❤️
👍👍👍👍👍👍 love it...Slava UKRAINI
Special sinking operations.  Slava Ukraine. Defenders of Ukraine.  Hurrah.  They were asked to surrender, they decided to participate in the special sinking operations.
The angels are cursing this Criminal , Mr Putin ,.....He will not survive this War....
Don’t worry, it is just undergoing a brief underwater training exercise and has no intention partaking in the wa —> special military operation.
SLAVA UKRAİNE
Now the biggest Russian submarine 😂
Fake news the vassel is still at Sevastopol Port
SLAVA UKRAINI
May it meets satan in hell!
Russian warship got fucked!!! wohoo!!!!
I'm surprised they didn't say it was a "special underwater operation". Well done Ukraine.
The obsolete epoch laterally chew because grandson actually behave alongside a juvenile inch. sneaky, better wrist
Oh dear … this ship used to play a big part in the May 9th victory celebrations….. yep 👍 everything is going to plan alright …
Rip
LATEST MOSCOW NEWS BRIEF: Thousands of Russian soldiers have died from their rifles backfiring on themselves and not from Ukrainians firing at them. LOL NEXT STEP: Russia declares war on Russians for sinking their own ship.
why would any black person support Ukraine openly racist country? Russia never participated in the slave trade in fact it had a general in the 1700s who was black had a well-known author who was black through history Russia has always respected and embraced black people. Russian never sat down with the Europeans after world war I and divided Africa to exploited the continent. Russia always helped black people I as a black man will never support n Ukraine over my real human Brothers who are Russians. no educated black person real black person will support Ukraine. real black people will always stand with Russia
Guess if Ukraine sinks a few more ship it will become clear to the Russian people that the Russian navy does not know how to store ammo on their ships.
It is an old vessel built in Nikolai a long time ago...in the Soviet area and was not part of the Special Operation in Ukraine....
Russia's war summed up in one sound byte: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJxCdh1Ps48
Fantastic news!
Special Sinking Operation —😂😂😂
Yahoo! Sink them all in the black sea!
If Russia wanted to demonstrate incompetence......job well done
Kremlin; “Everything is going according to plan.”
Hey Man Nice Shot! $720M asset sunk, Thats why I say Hey Man Nice Shot!.
Good news! a Pity Putin was not onboard when it sank.
Well thats a shame,Not!!! More Russian military junk destroyed
So the Ship has denazified at least two Ukrainian Missiles and was afterwards converted to a Submarine. What a great Victory for Russia :-)
Some new Ukraine babies will be named Neptune. "HI Javelin,  come meet my friend Neptune ".
Urrah!
Moscow claims they sunk the flagship to put out the fire.
It was the water’s fault for entering the hull. A Ukrainian missile had nothing to do with it.
No footage
Russians, with the help of Ukrainians, successfuly keep demilitarizing themselves 😁🖕🇷🇺
was it hit with a bb from a man on inflatable duck
The ship was old.... as if to say the Russians have any new ships?  lol
More proof that Putin is a failure.
This story will be put out by every media outlet in the world as a great victory for Ukraine, the Russians will sell it as a naval accident blah blah blah........  My fear is that we have not seen the end of this conflict and Ukraine will in the end, likely loose the whole of their eastern regions, including Mariupol to the relentless bombardment going on.  I am in no way disrespecting the very brave Ukrainian defence force, but logistics are against them and they cannot open a land, sea or air supply route in.  They must push an offensive on the ground to break the stranglehold on Mariupol and only then will they be able to move for full victory against the Russians.
What's especially humiliating is that it was up to a *Turkish* ship to rescue the crew 🤡
😂
Russian ship go to bottom
Give Putin nothing but take from him everything.
God I hope so, I do feel sorry for the poor, misinformed, conscripted or otherwise that had no choice.  My heart goes out to their mothers, families.  I may get a lot of flack, but I feel sorry for these poor Russian soldiers who had no idea what they were signing up for, or for that matter any choice in that matter. My heart is breaking for the mothers of this poor souls, they are all human beings.  PUTIN is truly evil and the US needs to take heed, Trump would use our sons as "cannon fodder" in a heartbeat.  He and Putin are peas in a pod.
SLAVA Ukraine 🇺🇦
GOOD YES YES YES!!!
Great!
SINK THEM ALL
AHHAHAHAHAHAH  Yeah!  Sink that bast*ard!  Makes my day.
ALRIGHT UKRAINE GOOD JOB!!
Russian 🇷🇺
LOL!!!!!
It didn’t sink...the Russians navy reclassified it as a one way submarine!
It is difficult to be at the side of the russians. They do everything wrong even when they do nothing
A vingança foi feita
A small comedian is constantly killing people of a country Ukraine, of a country. Just to make yourself a legend, to make your own prime minister's mattress sustainable. Biden is giving support for his own success, the world NATO member countries do not understand who is suffering the loss. Russia is not getting oil or gas.😁
It was not sunk, they made a special operation and it turned into a submarine.
Is this the “f*** off”war ship?🤣
Idk what’s more embarrassing, the fact that the Ukrainians are making the Russian military look like a joke, or that that Russian military is making the Russian military look like a joke.
🐱💐🇺🇦🐱💐💝🐱💐❤️
Now it's a submarine.
I don't know what is more embarrassing: - Having your flagship being hit and sunk by a country without an active navy or  - Having your flagship blow up in your face do to your own men gross negligence.  In any case, everything is proceeding exactly according to plan, of course.
Dear Russian Navy... https://youtu.be/rX7wtNOkuHo

Picture or didn't happen
Bye bye Great shooting fae the Ukraine boys,
Aww promoted to a special op with the fishes
Russia has a special new submarine
It didn't sink, it was recommissioned as a submarine. ;)
It is great news
Glory! Orc boat sinks, let us party! Glory to Ukraine!
💙💛
Mazzel tov! Keep going.
Well done Ukraine!
A win for Russia- now they got a Submarine 😅🤣🤣
Russian Navy  officially trolled
Symbolic nuclear missals?
So, basically… the warship f*cked itself, according to the RuZZians? Because ammunition caught fire?
As a Western taxpayer, this is money well spent. Please keep on providing these incredible people with the weapons they need. 👍👍
This is actually a brilliant move by the Russian military, absolutely brilliant. They've secretly converted a warship into a stealth submarine, all the while pretending that it "sank". That Putin is really a military genius, huh? 😂 Slava Ukraini. 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
All I really gotta say is this: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I can hear cheering from Florida!
This is great news and a huge help for Ukraine. And no,this is not a "symbolic" win for Ukraine.
It sinked according to plans.
Well done. This war can stop today if the Russian military simply return back to Russia. Ukraine will then return to normal life and rebuild its beautiful ancient cities.
Apparently it can go f*ck itself underwater.
Beautiful 👌
The mastermind of Bucha massacre America Britain Zelensky Azov batallion behind  ship incident May GOD Annihilate eliminate America Britain Zelensky from earth Amen
Niiiiice!
Finally a TITANIC Sequel is happening.
Bahaha Well done Ukraine 🇺🇦 👏
Oh well. Sink them all
A Special Underwater Operation
Good, sink em all...
They turned it into a submarine lol
it's sleeping with the fishes now!
Look that is water under the bridge move on go home and sleep shame the lie Ukraine since the stink ship
It didnt sink it was damaged
Ukraine has faught Russia on the land, sea, and the air. Winston Churchill would be proud!
I don't believe there were no casualties. Especially if it was struck by a missile. The truth will out.
it is the same ship that was advised to go f*k itself on the first day of war, near Snake Island)
Slava Ukraine ❤
Great News and a pity more of the fleet did not do the same, as then it would be upsetting for Putin.
Hmm..but not because of the missile, but because it was made of cardboard.
God.  I really don't know which story would be worse for Russia right now . . . Did Ukrainians sink their flagship?  Or did their ship just pop a leak, just like the tires literally fell off of their APC's?   This would be so funny if they didn't have nukes.
and again 'breaking  news'  with no vid or picture of the actual sunken ship ... it's all hear say
get rekt
Moskva cruiser had been successfully de-nazified.
I love news stories like where they present the story from both sides. Too many would just report "Ukraine Sinks Russian Flagship!" when all that is actually known is that it sank.
Bye!!
I wonder if they have seen Davie Jones, yet?
RT: "russian Cruiser promoted to Submarine"
they have a new sub again
Soviet/ Russian warships have a couple of major design flaws.   One is that it is standard practice on Soviet/Russian warships to NOT have their firefighting systems energized for instantaneous use in dealing with fires.   The VMF lost a destroyer n the 1970s due to this fault.   The other major design flaw is the vulnerability of their missile loadout to battle damage.   The antiship missiles and the antiaircraft missiles are highly vulnerable if the warship is struck by missiles, bombs, and gunfire.   This is a lesson which the VMF has not learned yet.  It seems likely that another flaw exists in damage control concerning a flooding casualty.   If the ship’s pumps are dependent upon an auxiliary power source then the clear indication is that the pumps did not have sufficient power to operate and de-water the ship.   De-watering the ship would be necessary since water is used to suppress any fires in belowdecks spaces.   Additionally, the ship has an odd arrangement of watertight compartments.
A qui esta la prueva que el ser humano es una especie agresiva es te mundo es una marabilla por que no buscais una manera mejor de adptaros ala vida embez de truiros  este mundo podria ser un paraiso
So nice to see Putin donating ships for artificial reefs
russian propaganda is very predictable: after  work on the surface was successfully completed -  declared to submarine
Sink 'em all! 😁
Night night sleep not tight
Good
Good fucken job!!!!
Massive strike there…. To sink the flag ship ….. That’s just insane👍
Hate to be that tugboat driver 😬
LOVELY
Good!!! Slava Ukraini!!!🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇸😹😂🤣
This is embarrassing for Russia they have really underestimated Ukraine and didn't expect them to attack back. Then they enjoy playing the victims as if they are surprised by it all. I'd love to be in Putin's delusional mind do see what goes on in there.
The cruiser "Moskva" heroically destroyed two "Neptune" -missiles with its hull. For this heroic act, it was promoted to the rank of submarine
It was a special sinking operation. Perfectly designed, perfectly executed by the Russians.
Russian TV just said the Moskva isn't sank, she actually dived like a submarine to avoid Ukrainian anti-ship missiles targeting her again. Wow, what a mighty Russian navy!!
Moskva: https://youtu.be/Bu8bH2P37kY
Russia go home to Russia!  Rejoin the world civilly!  Prayers for 🇺🇦  Ukraine to emerge victorious, free, sovereign and stronger than ever before!
Well done!
Ok, so russia is saying it accidentally sunk its own ship….yeah….sure.   Happens all the time.
🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
I was expecting state media to say that the sinking of Moskva was staged 😅
Great news. Quickly Ukraine strike again hit another Russian ship!
Break out the good stuff!
Hey peutty, your missing a missile cruiser worth millions.
Whether it was due to Ukrainian missiles or internal fire, Moskva's fate absolutely reeks of Russian ineptitude.
So apparently the Russians prefer the "we're so inept that we sink our own ships" explanation. Fair game, Russia, fair game!
Russia asThe power , does not pray  to Dod , God does not love power , the old proverb, all empires created by force, in the same way disappeared, disappeared by force GREATINGS FOR UKRAINIAN PEOPLE
The only thing unclear is how it was already known last night by Ukraine, Turkey and Romania that the ship capsized and sank while Russia and western media were reporting  it like just severely damaged. Even a few hours ago it was still claimed as just damaged.  And all of a sudden we hear today that it got sunk "while russians were towing it" lol BTW, did Russia report how many sailors actually survived? According to the latest data it is only 14 people.  "We evacuated all crew" is not quite correct to put it mildly.
Slava Ukraine!
Puttin don't like that
Awesome!
well in russia they said, they just put the fire out
I'm surprised the Russians didn't say that they sunk the ship itself...  What a bunch of idiots.
Being towed or sunk ?
I wonder who had the dubious task of informing Putin 🤣😂🤣 🇺🇦❤️🇺🇦
Putin is going to have kittens over this !
Slava Ukrainii....!🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦 💪💪💪💪💪
cool 🥰
Yeah Ukraine. Russia the Aggressor being kicked from pillar to post. The bully’s of Europe are finally getting what they deserve.
Black eye for Putin!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
The wishing "Russian warship, go f*ck yourself" has literally happened
Hahaha this is hilarious! The second "strongest" military in the world getting their asses whipped by some farmers with a few cheap missiles😂😂
It was special naval operation to convert Black Sea flagship into submarine
🎉🎉🎉
special naval  operation to turn the Moskva into a submarine     ;-)
Well the fish that dont want to become fish sticks can hide from captain iglo in the wreck 😅
They are not going to say it was missiles due to pride
Hallelujah!
At least they had time to organize a rescue operation. If all of those sailors had gone down with the ship it would have been a tragedy.  Nice shot Ukraine!
Russian tanks explode and their missile cruisers turn into artificial reefs.  The mighty Russian army can't even take on tiny little Ukraine.  Putin is limp.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
"The Russian ship is now operating outside of the usual perimeters of 'sea level', as 'sea level' is a Western concept that Russia chooses not to recognise."
Good job Ukraine! Ukraine fighting Russia like crazy should inspire Taiwan, and deter the CCP from any similar stupid moves.
So apparently the Russians are as bad at lying as they are at fighting maybe they should try fishing or dancing they gotta be good at something
jpll;y good work
Lets take Ukrain to NATO... then the mighty Ukrains will protect us all.. 😆 so cool army.
Its 'symbolic presence' is not hardly as symbolic as its sinking....
It DID NOT sank, It became a submarine, - Everything is going according to Russia's plan.
It's God will! Moscov is sink! Thanks God! Slava Ukraini! 🇺🇦 Lord is Great!
Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Moskva was under tow by two John Deere Tractors   🚜 🚜 ___________ 🛳
Slava Ukraini
Sink it, sink the lot.
Holy cow, that's great 👏👏 let's sink them all and make sure Putin will never invade another country. Glory and peace to Ukraine 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦 The world stands with Zelenskyy and Ukraine 🤝🤝🤝🤝 Keep strong Ukraine 💪💪💪💪
Yesssss!!! Great News!!!!!
ukraine lost the antonov 225, this is pay back
Pity it didn't sink five minutes after the first explosion.
A well
Is it still going to plan, Vlad?
🎼🎵🎶Another bites the dust and another ones gone, and another ones gone, and nother one gets sunk🎵🎶🎶
This would explain why the Russian Navy has a penchant for windows on their subs.It helps when looking for the rest of their fleet.
Funny thing no one is lying for once, Russia just skips parts of the story. There was two cruise missiles, that was intercepted by "Moscow"s hull, causing a fire, it was burning and is now sunk.
Lol
The Ukrainian military is PUTIN' on a great battle!!! 🇺🇦  💙 💛
Oh no it hasn't says Putin,,it's transformed into a submarine.
Nice... :D What I wanted to ear is putin is dead... :D that would be really good... :D
Incredible achievement by the Ukraine - not bad for a nation with a tiny navy - devastation blow to Russia
As for everything in this conflict it's almost impossible to believe on what's coming out from bolth sides
🤣😂😂🤣 🥳🥳🥳🥳 RUS military are embarrasing, incompetent weak clowns in land, air & sea.
It’s now where it belongs 🇺🇦
Funny to see the Russians affirm that they didn't loose to the Ukrainians, but rather to their characteristic incompetence. Distracted by a drone! On land, do they distract the Russians with glove puppets? LoL!
Flagship sunk. Bad Omen Russian Soldiers, go home, stop the War!
Lovely 🚀💥🔥 Russian warship 🖕
Она утонула В.В.Путин
Its now part of the "🇷🇺das boot squad!"♠🎩🏵🎯🏁💙💛🌻🇺🇸
Woot woot woot! Celebration! Come on! 🎶
Video or it didn't happen
Let's go with the Russian story for a second...... "Our ships are completing suicide" That plays better than a rocket attack from a country we are at war with.
😸😂😅🤣😸😂😅
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
So the Russians could not even successfully tow their damaged ship? Maybe they should have asked some Ukrainian farmers to help them!
Someone is going to accidentally fall from a balcony.
It's not true! Russians made it into a submarine on purpose, the operation was a thrilling success by Russian marines.
Good news 👍👌😅🤣
How they gonna spin this in their propaganda?
TONIGHT ITS PARTY TIME IN UKRAINE     YES SIR           Z STAND FOR ZERO      BUT UKRAINE HAVE HEROES
Hopefully very soon Moscow will follow.
Hahaha
Woohoo! One less thing for Ukraine to worry about! I hope all that material onboard doesn't contaminate the sea water.
It certainly had nuclear warheads on board.
“Moskva missile cruise ship”??
Those Ukrainians are really something !!!   🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦   Congratulations !
Russia will stick with fire story and even broaden on that. They can not let nor admit to their not being so mighty and better than others.
Fascism is the power of finance capital itself. It is the organization of terrorist vengeance against the working class and the revolutionary section of the peasantry and intelligentsia. In foreign policy, fascism is jingoism in its most brutal form, fomenting bestial hatred of other nations.
Congratulation to the success of Moskva’s “Special Titanic Stimulation Operation”
Fantastic!!!!!!!!
Can anyone put a US dollar amount on this ship? I would guess a couple hundred million but that's just a guess.
W. P. Utin  "The ship was old and sank according to plan"
Hahahahaahahhahahahaha
The Russian Navy obviously have no fire control aboard their ships. Maybe a few fire extinguishers or a hose or two might have been a good idea?
Warship unfortunately on the special military operation hit iceberg.
YES !!!!!!! Glory to the brave people of Ukraine , well done :) Zoe , Ca
Ghost of Tsushima 😂😂😂🥳
Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦💪
She just said the same thing 3 times: 1. Russian ship damaged because of onboard fire then sank, according to RF 2. Russian ship sank because of missile strike, according UA
All this war is doing is weakening Russia to be able to fight a conventional war.....And condemning a generation of its young men to a early grave....Putin hasn't really thought this throw if his end game was to join the Crimea to the rest of Russia, He should of kept the war contained to the east......
Karma 😂😂😂😂
✊️✊️✊️🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
It did not sink. Everything is according to the plan.
Ukraine elite farmers division have been despatched to aid recovery to a safe harbour for dismantling possibly Odessa :))))) Glory to Ukraine
GREAT NEWS !!!  THE BULLY GETS HIS NOSE BLOODIED!   The Knives our out Putin will be gone , 'removed' within 2 months
SLAVA UKRAINI 🇺🇦 SLAVA HEROYAM 🤘
Flagship 😂😂😂😂
flagship moskva hit by two missle fleet flagship Moskva is sinking an april spring night on a glory night listening to the wind of change
Would have been really embarrassing if it DIDN'T SINK after the Russian Captain called an "Abandon Ship"
wondering if 1 of those anti-tank missles could penetrate ships armour?  Row out quietly in the night and fire away!
56 cruise missiles left with the Black Sea fleet. Use them wisely Ivan.
💥💥💢✌✌✌
More proof that Russias military is old and weak. They might be the ones getting invaded soon.
Smiling
Hard to imagine a weapon powerful enough to sink a ship that size other than a torpedo. Must have struck an ammunition storage area. This ship is reported to have 500 sailors on board.
🇺🇦💪
How many warships does Russia have left?
If true, at what cost? Surly it didn’t go without a fight? Also, 1 ship out of how many?
Haha at least the putinoids told the truth: They put the fire out :)
Low marks on fire fighting evolution of exercise , darn

Good news  Ukraine people
Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦
Well done!!!!!!  Glory to Ukraine! Glory to Free World!
Regardless it is embarrassing to Russia. Go Ukraine
Fantastic news. Ukraine are awesome.
I wonder how many Crewmen died and went down with the Ship? A full Crew compliment is 510. That's not saying there were 510 people on it at the time. I did 6 years in the US Navy before switching to the US Army. My shop should have had 12 Crewmen but there was never more than 3 of us, which was the minimum number for getting underway. That ship could have been short many Crewmen resulting in severely overworked conditions resulting in Crewmen continually sleepy and very tired and unable to perform their jobs fully. The Radar operator on duty may have missed the incoming missiles which allowed a successful strike and now sinking. That's one of the reasons I got out of the US Navy. At sea we would stand a 6 hour watch, work 6 hours, go back and stand watch another 6 hours, and if nothing was broken get about 5 hours sleep. We sometimes would go 2 and 3 day's at a time without any sleep. Being at sea there are no days off to catch up on sleep and rest.
Putin: "the sinking ship was part of our plan, everything is going well"
Ukrainian's will never surrender to the Russians, May god watch over these brave women and men
Ukrainians build this ship Moskva in Mikolaiv in Soviet era of 70's - and we destroys it. Kyivan kings have build Moscow-city in the 1147 and we will destroy it.. "Never make ukrainians angry" -  Dzhokhar Dudayev
And in the spirit of non-accountability, some poor SOB Russian lower enlisted sailor will pay for its loss.
This was the exact same ship to which Ukrainian soldiers famously replied "Russian warship go f*ck yourself" on snake island. Guess what, it really got f^*ked badly. Hooray Ukraine. Sadly this does not come close avenge what Russians are doing to Ukraine. This ship also had around 500 orcs, I wonder how many survived?
It's all in Putin's plan.
Glory to God! Victory for Ukraine! Justice for all lost lives 🙏🙏🙏
BEST NEWS EVERERR
This war has been a disaster for Russia, their government have embarrassed themselves.  Pull out of Ukraine and let's start proper diplomatic talks.
1 Billion dollars Down the Drain.... ~~~~~~~~~
Excellent news!!
Oh dear, what a shame.🤣
So basically the russians are saying our incompetence sunk the ship.
I'm surprised the Russians didn't say that it's actually now a submarine 😂😂😂
The Russians are desperately explaining to their dear leader it wasn't the Ukrainians, it was just somebody having a smoke.
Celebrate!  Send Giuliani & Trump to Ukraine for prosecution!
Russia is excited to announce that the status of the Moskva has been upgraded to submarine.
IF russians (who are known as compulsive liars) confirming that Moskva went down... then it is true info.
So according to the russian cheats the ship has sunk in a storm... wind speed in Jalta at that time: 22km/h.... 😂😂😂
Fake news. The ship was actually transformed into a special type of submarine
Glory to Ukraine
Well done Uckraine. From Düsseldorf
50 minuted
Excellent news. Well done Ukraine!
Happy Birthday Moskva.
Wonder if there was my nukes on it 🤔
oh no! 😢
Azov Scuba team + Limpet Mine = Bye bye.    SLAVA UKRAINE!!!!
BAAAHAHA 🤣Just a fire on board, eh Putin? Loser 😝
太棒了，多打沉几艘，直接解放莫斯科
As long as the sailors made it off ,BUT OTHER THAN THAT SCREW THEM ,THEY WANT TO KILL UKRAINIANS,THEN SINK THAT DAMN FLEET. ITLL COST BILLIONS UPON BILLIONS.
Aircraft shot down at a ferocious rate, tank forces destroyed en masse, now the navy is taking losses.   Can one of Putins generals assist him towards retirement, perhaps with the assistance of a Makarov to the temple?  Then with the driving force behine the nightmare forces can withdraw.
Goodbye Moskva! aka MOSCOW! GOD BLESS UKRAINE!
Great great news!!!
Everything is going to the plan🤥
Slava Ukraini
I guess the Russian Navy doesn't believe in damage control.  I'd hate to see one take a Tomahawk.
🚜........⛴
Someone will have tapped very gently on Vladimir’s Office door today…….
So it was either Ukrainian missiles or someone on board lit a cigarette in the ammo room? Hmm...
100% it wasn't a missile; it was a special operational guided rocket. Least a crane didn't fall on it.
Shot two "Neptune" missiles and sent it to Pluto. Glory to Ukraine!
Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Brilliant trick to paint that bloody great target on the stern... who would've thunk it? Slava Ukriani!
Very good news I will be happy all day slava ukrani
Das Boot 😀
God bless Russia against godless westerns criminal civilization.
Nice!
Russia is now claiming it did not sink but is a new Submarine.
Good shot ! CONGRATULATIN Ukraina ! 👏👏👏  smiert okupantom !
it's look like modern weapons destroyed a accient vessel!
One wonders if Putin's plans included so much rust.
Jealous of the attention bestowed on the Russian Army, the Russian Navy decided to demonstrate that they, too, are capable of world-class incompetence.
The Russian military has seen better days...
🤗😂🤗
Slava Ukraine!!!!!
I'm so glad that the Ukraine military has sunk the flag ship of Russia
Look on the bright side "Putin" the fire is out!
We are only rinsing it with seawater to put out the fire! Everything is under control!
Classic David vs. Goliath! Glory to Ukraine!
They ALWAYS lie. But this time they realized they couldn't cover the truth. "Towing the vessel to port"??? C'mon. Really? The social media manager of Russia is really poor.
Most excellent! Great job Ukraine! Slava Ukraine!
good Friday come 🫴 early book it 📚!
Putin keeps losing military hardware. Maybe they are not as tough as our "Intelligence" thought.
Moskva is now the newest submarine of Russian navy.
Footage from the ground in Mariupol https://youtu.be/5VrKFX7DmQE
mokva? :D Moskow! Moskow is on the bed of the sea! The ship did what the guys on the ilsland requested, went to f itself ;)
How terrible for them 🤣🤣
I was waiting 40 years for like this sytuations. Jack from Polen.
No, no, no, no ... it did not sunk. This is a 'Special Transformation and Recovery Operation'. We transform it into a submarine. Slava Ukrain 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦💥💥
I'm surprised the Russians didn't say they were giving someone a Viking funeral.
Russian state media reports that a member of staff that someone tripped and pulled the plug out the hull
This ship and Russia will share the same fate.
Long live Ukraine! I want to know why some Republicans and Faux News support Russia?
Nice work 👏 lads ,,, Fight smart,,
UKRAINE 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Slava!!! 🥳🥳🥳👏👏👏
U.S. Pentagon, Kirby said the damaged Russian warship is afloat and "making her own way across the Black Sea."  “We assess that the ship is able to make its own way, and it is doing that; it's heading more towards now we think the east. We think it's probably going to be putting in at Sevastopol for repairs, but we don’t know what exactly caused that,” Kirby added.  Kirby said the ship had been operating with a few other Russian vessels about 60 miles (about 96 kilometers) south of Odesa.  "The explosion was sizable enough that we picked up indications that other naval vessels around her tried to come to her assistance, and so eventually that wasn’t apparently needed. So she is making her own way across the Black Sea and we’ll continue to try and monitor this as best we can," he added.
i thought they anti missile defenses. maybe switched off?
Viva Ukrania
NEPTUNE MISSLES...........................................al HAIL!!!!!!!!!!!🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨
Herr Putin, good news, the fire is out... great news... also a bit lesser news though...
Now go sink the rest .
Yess!!!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👍
To think, just a month ago they were considered a smaller, but credible rival of the USA, now losing their flagship to a poor country without a navy, who decimated 30% of their best battle groups, forcing a humiliating retreat in the north. The Turkish or Italian navy would probably wipe the floor with them.
Go ukraine
May God bless Ukraine 🇺🇦 with more victories.
Everyone in the West is having a laugh over this -I just hope we can get final confirmation of what actually happened to it
Yahoo.. death to the fleet….
A missile could have started the fire even if it did not explode. USS Stark comes to mind.
Goodbye
I was having a bad day. This put a smile on my face.
✌✌✌🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦👏👏👏
What? this is impressive, I think or I hope just saying.
Excellent,,and I bet many died,,just from the way Russia denies it,,top effort Ukraine,,,
It was distracted by a drone towing a banner that read " go f#€k yourself", and then got hit by two Neptunes from the other side.
Wouldn't want to be the one telling Putin his flag ship sank after being attacked by a local rowing boat armed with a couple of Neptune missiles.
I don’t think I have ever heard of a naval ship accidentally sinking itself. I expect the Ukrainian version is true.
I watched it go down. IT SUNK while being towed. Crew burned or drowned. No attempt to take them off. SCOTTY REPORTING FROM ODESSA.
Looks like it really went and f*&%ed itself.
LMAO - Russia is a JOKE!!!!!!!!
What am I missing here... For decades we in the west were continually reminded about the formidable might & power of the ussr/soviet/russian military. I would of thought they could steamroll Ukraine in a week or two, job done. The russian forces seem ill-equipped, incompetent & poorly organized.
Great news !! Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦🇺🇦
Whether by attack or by a misfire it’s a bad look for Russia.
Beautiful work
They sank the largest warship since the Second World War. And this was not done by the maritime powers of the United States or Britain, this was the work of UKRAINE. This is fantastic.
Moskva had sunk on the 110th anniversary of titanic sinking. Hopefully it's a sign that Russia will sink (lose) like titanic.
poor fish. all the toxic stuff. a danger to shipping.
Slava Ukraine 🇬🇧🇺🇦✌️✌️✌️✌️
To lose the flag ship, no matter why its a very bad thing.
As noted by a commenter on another thread - After this ‘special military operation’ Russian admirals will be forced to inspect their fleet in a glass-bottomed rowboat.
This war has been purely pointless nd avoidable.....which would have resulted in win win for both sides....
I hope Russia also sinks with Moskva
This is PROPAGANDA! The flagship has used it's stealth capability and it is now impossible to see!!  It absolutely did not sink,  there was a small fire on board and in no way was the flagship hit by two Ukrainian missiles.
Russian Special Sinking Operation.
It sank because of moon rays and  toaster
Excellent news. Sink them all!!
chefs kiss
That's the ship that was told to go, eh, "screw" itself by the Snake Island guards? Looks like that finally happened.
Looks like Russia lost its main anti aircraft capable ship. Im guessing well be seeing black sea fleet losses mount considerably in the near future. Guess those harpoon missiles on their way will help. That whole costal occupation is starting to look exposed. Could be the donbas isnt really where Ukraine will fight its next main battle atall.
On the 110th anniversary of the Titanic sinking no less!
Great news, hopefully they will get the rest of them
Refitted eh....Going to need fitting with a periscope now tee hee hee
"Woooo! Yeahhhhh baby, that's what I've been waitin' for! That's what it's all about! Wooo!" - A Wise Man
holy cow....but really it is a old ship.....russia couldnt build their own and tried to get france to build one....and they were stupid enough to build it....just another lafayette scandal in the waiting
Putin’s motor yacht, MR Ragnar is taking its place. It’s the same colour and roughly the same size.
Bismarck 1941, Tirpitz 1944,... to be continued.
It was NOT a Ukrainian missile which hit it , it was a special operations projectile.
❤️❤️🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Foreign Russian minister reports that the ship did not sink it did a tactical barrel roll to avoid incoming missiles.
For a country desperate for financial  support, losing battleships in a war of choice is pretty reckless and dumb! Trump's buddy isn't a genius after all!
Buenas noches senior putin 😘
how did all the sailors live?
Cruiser Moskva was reclassified to an archaeological survey vessel exploring bottom of the Black sea, searching for Amphoras.
It was all done according to the plan. The ship transitioned from surface to the special underwater mode of operation.
Do I remember? I certainly do. Bravo! Good work, Ukraine.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I bet Adolf Putin is having hysterics. The chief of the Navy will shortly be on route to one of the gulags.
Maybe the Russian navy had to dill holes in it's keel to drain fire fight water. Lol
😂😂😂
Captain Pugwash rumoured to be responsible ... hooo hooo me hearties ....
So much winning by Putin for the RuZZians. RuZZian Navy jealous of the level of incompetence exhibited by the Army and airforce, decides to scuttle their own Black Sea flagship.
Fires don’t sink warships, anti-ship missles sink warships. Edit: Fires don’t sink competently mand warships*
That would be a great boon to the Ukrainian navy - if they actually had one. That leaves the Russian Black Sea fleet still in total control of the contested waters.
As Hall and Oates Sang .... she’s gone Baby she’s Gone
Russian Special Artificial Reef mission a complete success.
If Russia doesn't withdraw from its fight against Ukraine , fire will consume them ,fire will even fall upon mOscow
Now, they're going to say that this type,can also operate as a sub & getting it sunk was the plan from the very first moment?
xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
At this point, it's in Russia best interest to accept publicly that Ukraine sank the ship. Imagine announcing to the Russian public that their flagship sank because some sailor was taking a cigarette break near the munition depot or something like that.
GREAT, one less death machine. To all European friends use gas carefully and coal from Russia. Not a tall if possible.
Waiting for the trolls to tell me it's fake news....
The Russians are correct.  A fire did cause the ship to sink.  The fire was caused by a direct hit from a Ukrainian Neptune missile.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
slava ukraine
If it was a fire, then how come the Ukanians first announced it and identified the ship when it was well over the horizon?  - also it seems other Russian ships moved further away from the Ukranian cost.  So these two facts clearly point to awell diserved kick in the groin for Putin.
Ha, good.
I hope they wrote ' for the sailors ' on the rocket.
Right on. Support from the U.S. 🇺🇲 🤜🤛🇺🇦
How nice of the Russians to provide an artificial reef in the Black Sea.  Slava Ukraini ✊️ 🇺🇦
Excellent news!.... Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕 to Russia!!
Why they didn't show the video when the ship sunk? Potentially hoax so much
When your flagship is 40 years old. Trying to be a superpower with a GDP almost tied with Spain is a tricky thing to do.
Let's just keep meme-ing the Russian propaganda until the war ends. The Moskva destroyed two Ukrainian missiles by detonating them on its hull and began a one-way special underwater operation as a safety measure.
Moskva promoted to submarine branch 👋🏼
Dumb Media & Dumber Puppeteers... 🤣🤣😂😂😂
There was a fire onbord but never sink
- - FINALLY RUSSIA GETTING IT OWN TREATMENT strikes on town in Bryansk - - Keep it up UKRIANE GOOD JOB
Excellent. Russian flag ship of the Black Fleet destroyed. The same that went on the Snake Island. Russians destroyed Ukrainian plane, the biggest in the world and Ukrainians sank their nb 1 ship. Slava Ukraini!
Russia said it's not a missile but fire that sunk the ship. What if it was lightning sent by God as a warning to the devil.
Bem feito, o Putin quer bater com o modo Deus ligado, mas acabou se fodendo.
just made my day, superb news!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
How many Ukrainian tractors is it going to take to haul it?
Access to Black Sea is blocked by Turkey. These losses are irreversible and there are anti-ship missiles inbound from west as well.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Good
I'll drink to that. :-)
Don't know what's worse, that Ukraine sank their flagship or that Russian vessels are so pathetic they explode on their own.
Pity Captain Putin was not aboard!
NATO should "liberate" Russia ASAP.
Россия не могла и пукнуть в ванне. SLAVA UKRAINI !
Pics or it didn’t happen
Good job Ukraine 🇺🇦
I am wondering if the Russians scuttled her because once the weather cleared satellites would be able determine if it was missile hits or an accident/sabotage.
It hasn't sunk!!         It's on a special clam finding operation.
😂😂😂
Remember when the world feared the Russian armed forces, one of the worlds highest budget military and one of the best fighting forces?? Well 🤦🏼‍♂️😂😂
Didn't the Russian say the fire was under control and being towed back to port for repair? Everything has gone according to plan?
Great. Next one please
What a disgrace to the Russian Navy. I think this debacle will have place in the same line with Tsusima of 1905.
Yyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh Ukraine Heroes are winning 💪👍👍🤘🤘🙏👍💪 Russia is going down 😎
It turns out that sea is not a Russian scenario …
Putin's Kingdom seems to be collapsing while Ukraine is supported and sided by many countries.
Expect a much larger and prolonged war.
RT NEWS: The proud battle cruiser Moscva was retrofited to submarine, for strategical reasons!
Russian Flag ship now promote to submarine 💯
The russian warship went and fucked itself.
There is no way a fire caused it to sink, ofc the ammo explosion could have even without a strike, but if they managed that on their own then wtf is wrong with them
Stay strong Ukraine 🇺🇦 🇬🇧
They'll say "It has been adapted into a permanent, stationary submarine."
Remember  it's just  steel put a hole in it any ship will sink
It was a Special Operation to convert a battleship into a submarine. All part of the plan.
This is bad news for Ukraine.
LOOOL This is the glorious Russian army (navy).
Ukraine: "We sunk a Russian ship." Russia: "Nu-uh! WE sunk a Russian ship!"
Mistake #1: spelling of Moskva Mistake #2: calling it a cruise ship
How sweet it is
Good work!!
I hope they scribbled "Russian Warship - Go F**k yourself"! on the Neptune missiles.
WOW IT ACTUALLY F#$$D OFF!!!! LOL....SLAVA
Hope the crew didn't evacuate
👍🇺🇦👍🇺🇦👍🇺🇦👍🇺🇦👍
Ah no! According to the Kremlin it's only partially sunk as the tip of the bow is still visible above water.
Putin that has sunk Moscow.
UKRAINE FACTS WWII SOVIET UKRAINIAN & RUSSIAN numbers  The USSR, not "Russia" lost 23 million people of whom 13 million were military1941-1945.Ukraine, alone lost 14 million (according to Russian archives. 8 million soldiers and 6 million civilians). The other 15 Soviet republics including “Russia” lost a combined total of 9 million people 5 million of whom were military. Ukraine lost 150% more than all the other 15 Soviet republics combined.  To reiterate: The Soviet Union lost a total of 23 million people; Ukraine lost 14 million of those. The other 14 republics ALL TOGETHER including a place called “russia” lost 9 million people The Soviet Union lost a total of 13 million soldiers; Ukraine lost 8 million of those. The other 14 republics ALL TOGETHER including a place called “russia” lost 5 million soldiers Germany was defeated in Ukraine, as Churchill wrote. By comparison, for every American who died in Europe in World War II, 135 Ukrainians died. For every American who died worldwide in WWII 52 Ukrainians died. About a quarter of all World War II dead worldwide were Ukrainians. By the way   by the way,  All the German girls and women in 1945 were raped by RUSSIANS in Germany. The rapists came in the second and third waves of the soviet front. The first waves were always Ukrainians except in the farthest north. They did the fighting and dying. The russians came up afterwards and began the mass rape, mass looting and mass murder of the German civilian people. These facts were not believed until now in Ukraine as the world sees who and what the russian people are. (it is NOT putin's war, rather it is the war of the russian people as a whole against the Ukrainian people, THAT HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR 350 YEARS.
Seems like Putin, can't run with the big boys lol
Well, we told this ship to back off, apparently they didn’t understand, we had to explain.
Ukraine's never surrender!, 💪 never more!, rank' to the victory! 💪💪💪💪💪.
Dont try to diminish what Ukraine has accomplished. It was an old but dangerous ship and it deserves its place at the bottom of the sea. May it rest in pieces
More scrap delivered to Ukraine. Fantastic news!
The whole Russian invasion is a sinking ship
The chipboard it was made of got waterlogged, and once the gorilla glue got wet it fell apart!
LoL 😅😅😅! Hit by missile by not sink... Now in Crimea
What is the potential contamination factor from onboard weaponry?
U sunk my battleship!
Ah, gee. That's a shame.  Good job Ukraine!!!
Dont believe the media.its a  convertible submarine 😝
- Last message from Communication Ensign on the Moskva  -  "Maybe we should have listened to the brave 13 from Snake Island, glug, glug, glug..."  Or in "Elon Speak" - Another happy "RUD" - (Rapid Unintended Disassembly) Moment!  Nice work 🇺🇦 Ukraine!!!  Putin and the Russian Navy - GFY!!!
Nice!!! They cant get more ships into the area sink them all!!!
Hahahahahahah
its now a submarine
3 000 000 000 usd lose
Si esta en el fondo del mar que biiieeennn.
More misinformation from the West. Princess Mindy's dad from Spongebob slapped the vessel twice. According to Kremlin reports.
Russian submarine Muskova, voyaged to the bottom, in "stormy seas", and, not surprisingly, weather radar shows NO STORMS on the Black Sea today.
Opps 🤭
Cause of neptune antiship missile
Good job...
It haven't sunk!!! More like negatively afloat :)
It doesn’t
How does it feel
👏👏👍👍
Great news.... Victory Ukraine 🇺🇦 👍😂👍😂👍
Good!👍🏻
Excellent
SWEEEEEEEEET 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
russia is NO match for western weapons, so glad the world is now seeing this.
I'm happy but confused...why aren't RIA lying?
it does not adds up ...something is fishy ....Russia is losing large number of its army personnel n equipments which is far advanced than Ukraine at least thats what whole world believed
Russian Flag Ship protected other ships of the fleet by intercepting Ukrainian missiles …. With its hull.
Show it or it never happened
Slava Ukraine.
MORE RUSSIAN JUNK BLOWN UP LOL
Good job Ukrainians..destroy all Russian power now.
Russians are allergic to truth. It's hilarious to see them create obvious lies about this.
The Russian army and navy are a joke, Putin is a joke. Victory for Ukraine.
1:11 _a symbolic presence _*_in_*_ the Black Sea_ Yes, it certainly is now *in* the Black Sea and a great place for it.  *Slava Ukrayini!*.
Possibly the best shot in history form a country that has no navy . excellent
Mokva...  it's MoSKVa literally means Moskow. missile cruise ship... that would be a fun vacation, but no it's a missile cruiser.
Putin says everything is going according to plan.
W-o-w........I mean at this point this is just pathetic and embarrassing for Russia.
I wonder who got to tell Putler the good news…and if they had a ‘heart attack’ too?
🤣😅😂🤣😅🤣😂🤣😅 Good, The baldy dwarf, the Kremlin and their state propaganda outlets will tell the Russian population it's all OK, it was a small fire and the Russian people will pretend to believe it.
:) Hell yea, nice shot Ukraine
It didn't sink, it was deNazified.
Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Can we see the footage ??  They seem to record everything else being shot at and blowing up !!
NATO VS SEATO
bahahahahha it sunk!!!! LMFAO get fukt putler bots!
It's going down it's going down prep prepare emergency food ways to protect yourself keep your mental state up and your physical still do your daily activities until further changes
YAAAAYY!!!! TAKE THAT POOTLER 💩
Embarrassing if the fire sunk it or Ukraine sunk it 😁
Fires dont sink ships. 🤣
Lol
I searched ripbozo and this came up lmao
The fleet flagship is 40 years old, from Soviet era. While Russian billionaires stole and pocketed billions of dollars from the Russian people, corrupt to the core.
It was a special ship to sub conversion operation
Propaganda
What a great day.
Great chess move Ukraine Russia thanks for playing play again death from Ukrainian killer hornets
Ruski wojenny statek poszedł na dno 👍👍👍👍👍
And I was sad because the ship didn't go down with the entire crew.  . Well, at least it finally sank. They could have repaired it otherwise. Now the ship won't be a threat ever again.
It will make a great reef for the marine life thanks Russia,BRAVO UKRAINE 🇺🇦
I think by now, paper has a better reputation than Russian metal.
Well done Ukraine 🇺🇦! Keep shaming the Russian dictator..
So they say a fire caused the ship to sink.  But doesn't that just mean they left out what (missiles from ukraine) caused the fire?
Nice work😀 Hats of for the Ukrainians ☀️
Perfect news. We are still waiting for such good news in the coming days. Glory to Ukraine!
Comrades, our glorious flagship Moskva has been converted to an even more glorious submarine and will from now on secretly denazify the bottom of the Black Sea.
Imagine a fire sunk a powerful flagship 😂😅
she didnt sink, black sea sink in it
rapid deconstruction and aquatic sequestration.
All those calling this a great victory, if Putin is the crazy guy, the genocidal guy, a butcher. Now we are sinking his ships. He has Nuclear weapons. What does a State, a pariah of the Western coalition, have to look forward too? Libya? Iraq? Afghanistan? Syria? Korea? The difference here, Vladimir Putin, the crazy, genocidal butcher... A huge bunch of Nuclear weapon sat waiting...  Now. I understand the retort. We could just pop a few back in the mail and VP and Russia is gone. Well, if anyone is thinking like that... Keep cheering as we back, as we are constantly told, a genocidal, crazy butcher into a corner of no escape. ☮️💚🙏
PMSL..
Russian warship has officially f*cked itself.
That's put a really big smile on my face.
not exactly Midway but still a hell of a day for naval warfare
It has been promoted to a Submarine now.
On Russian tv they reclassified Moskva as a submarine in a special operation
Sweet!     Russians say it was not a Ukraine missle rather just a small fire. Well, let's have more little fires on all their vessels!!!!!!
I’m calling BS.  Where is the video of proof ? Everything these days is caught on a camera ..
😂    "Old junk" 🤣
How sad never mind.
That ship was there to bring death and destruction to the Ukraine. So glad it can't do that. So glad, that the giant murdering machine has sunk.
ROFLMFAO, they’d rather have a headline as “The,( we sunk our own ship ) navy….”
Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦🇺🇲🇺🇦👹🇷🇺🇺🇦🇺🇲
Two cruise missiles hitting a warship that Heavily armed must of been like Dantes Inferno as all that Armament went up Damn well done Ukraine.🖒
Lol like a movie....lets celebrate even when they bomb Kiev flaten and 1000 dead......afterall its a movie for god sake!!!!
Slava UKRAINE
But the Russians said it was just a little damaged......Yeah, Ukraine!!!
It didn't sink - it's gone underwater to de-Nazify the marine life.
Deniing is getting harder these days, with all the cameras and sattelites whissing around everyhere 🤣🤣
No matter how they'll try to sell it: The Russian marine forces lose a mighty bit of their face. If they say it's been sunk by enemy forces, it looks bad. If they say it sunk by itself following the spread information of a spontaneous explosion in the ammunitions bunker, it looks even worse...
It was the flagship...not anymore!
good news. but is there any footage of it being sunk? would love to see that.
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻
India standa with Russia ....stay strong russia u will win against these wolves u r lion 🦁🔥
Sending in the Tractors,  boys...
The paper tiger is getting waterlogged now.
Let's look into the Ukrainian Corruption! Follow the money and all your questions will be answered!
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
UKRAINA KING 👍👍👍
Good work Ukraine let's take out some more Russian Ships Now!
I'm surprised that the Russians didn't use a line out of the German Kriegsmarine playbook and claim to have sunk the ship themselves. Oh well, how sad, never mind.
what a tragedy, the flagship of the black fleet, the pride of moscow, sunk by a single dropped cigarette
Man, when Ukraine says “russian warship, go f___ yourself!” they mean it! Glory to Ukraine!
nice :)
Russian Titanic 2022.
In the league of superpowers Russia is aquaman.
What really happened is that Putin changed the goal of the Moskva from a flag ship into a tactical breeding spot for Russian fish!
The pride of the Russian navy.... 😂😂😂
SLAVA UKRAINA
If the Russians are reporting it, unlikely to be true.  Probably being refitted right now and will appear before Odessa tomorrow.
I could say that arguably this is the biggest loss Russia has had during the war. Its a bigger black eye for Russia, another morale boost for Ukraine, and even if its 40 years old, expensive loss! Good job Ukraine! Slave Ukraine 🇺🇦
Rumor has it the ships radar tower is circling the earth along with hundreds of Russian tank turrets. Both China and the US complain to Russia about the increased space debri.
So the choice is to say Ukraine sunk it or their sailors were spectacularly incompetent.
too bad 'poo tin' was not on board
That is funny...........Take that Putin...
It will be a marine memorial to Putin's ineptitude.
We sailed for parts unknown to man Where ships come home to die.
"Ukraine War: Russia's Black Sea fleet flagship Moskva sinks" so let's "Convince It Forward" with Slava BOHU
One wonders how many admirals Putin will now fire.
This could be bad news, especially now Finland and Sweden also want to join NATO. Pushing a rat in a corner is always dangerous. We (the west) need to give Putin a way out on a diplomatic way in wich he can satisfy his ego or WW3 might start and end very fast.
Fabulous, did it go down with any nuclear weapons on it?
Not sunked! Its was converted in a submarine, said Putin
I see the Russian Navy has improved very little since Tsushima Straits
Uncle Albert at the wheel
This is SOOOOO satisfying 🥰
That's good news they can  fire on UkraineThe Russians don't like it when Ukraine fires back
Gonna be much easier for Ukrainians to perform airstrikes from the south with this piece off the board.
The ship has sunk, another environmental disaster. Arms on board and fuel will eventually leak.
My joy is unconstrained. Two down at least two to go. Where are the Russians hiding their wood burning aircraft carrier?
It didn't sink, it is a special operations submarine...
According   mosca   was  hit  by  a  mosquito
Glory to Ukraine indeed
Best news  all day, well done Ukraine
LOL   every second in Ukrain : 1000 russian soldiers killed  100 tanks blown up  100.000 new Elite Soldiers join Ukrain Army Ukrain claimed Russian Lightsabers Superman joined the war... Ukrain engineers rebuild Moon to Death Star
Finally some good news
Hopefully it wiped out a few dozen ruski admirals as well.
Yes, Mark, "the sinking was due to a "special underwater operation."💙💛🇺🇦🇨🇦💪
That's a good start.  Need another 5 or more to really shake things up.  Maybe get a sea lane open to support the good guys.
Best place for it, on the sea bed 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Arh this made my day. Cheers 🍺😁🖕
Under da sea, under da sea🦀🦀🦀🎶🎵🎶🎵
No images... So why would I still believe these clowns...
It likely to have been carrying Nuclear warheads. How deep is the question
I’m disappointed. I thought for sure that the Ukrainian tractor could pull it in and store it in some farmers field.
This is all part of Putins plan. As he said "its all going to plan". Putin is now searching though the Guinness book of big bold and almost totally unbelievable excuses.
Putin is finding out he can't prove his masculinity by riding a horse bare-chested.
Bravo Ukraine for "Special military sinking operation"
Slava YKPAIHA !
Karma for Snake Island. Good riddance.
This is fantastic news as churchill would say its sank into the deep depths of the ocean
Tactical retreat into the deeps for special underwater operation by newest mordor submarine
Slava Ukraine!
Bravo 🎉
Not only is russia giving Ukraine it's tanks, it is now setting it's battle ships on fire and sinking them amazing, God bless Ukraine, all the best from the uk.
The Russians now say it was always a special operations submarine.
Sink pootin too.
Built by Ukraine. Sunk by Ukraine. Happy Easter Putin 😛
Wow two Ukraine home made missiles sunk a "steel scrap  Russian warship". 👍🇺🇦🇺🇦
Yessssss. Nice. It becomes an artificial reef.
Oh bliss!
Sounds not possible
Russia clearly did not expect such resistance. This war could lead to the decline of Russia. It was a huge mistake.
Just special sinking operation :)
The warship Moskva has not sunk it has simply been reclassified as a new  type of submarine and is on a special underwater mission!!!
Glory to the Ukraine 🇺🇦
It was a beautiful ship. But on the ground of the see it looks even nicer ⚓⚓⚓
Amen, praise Jesus Christ the Master!
AMEN. Wish that was the whole Russian army.
Well deserved!  Слава Україні !!  🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦💙💛💙💛
The Russian army is a joke lol. Superpower my a$$.
Similar to the sinking of the Moskva, so Putin's political career.
Ukraine 🇺🇦 👍👍👍👍👍USA 👍👍👍👍, Russia 🇷🇺 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻Putin and tRump 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
Kremlin says that it was due to incompetence
It was UK missiles with a made in Ukraine sticker on the nose.  Close enough.
Lügen aus England🥱 ,wir aus Deutschland 🇩🇪 werden euch jetzt vernichten 🤘🏻🕯️
Just a simple conversion to a submarine.
Russian warship went and fcuked itself, as it was advised by Ukrainian border guard Roman Hrybov!
Wonder what the men of the Arctic convoys would think of this.
Grid Reference ??? What is the wreck Location ??? ‘Hope a Ukrainian Farmer Can Retrieve it 🤣   👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👌🇨🇦
Good news....👍🇬🇧
It sunk hours ago…..haha, most seamen died.
AWESOME!  Slava Ukraine!
Ukraine should invade Russia
If Putin offers tea to Russian generals today, they should kindly refuse.
Well, THAT certainly reduces Russian ability to conduct shore and civilian bombardment by missile.
OMG LOOOOOOOL 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Russians: "Operation Titanic is proceeding as planned..."
Get rid of that Soviet era BS. Bottom of the drink is the best place for it. Slave Ukraine
And this is true because......
Putin is no good for the human race !!! He needs to go bye bye !!!
Russian warship, got f'd
Vlad must be Furious. If it was an accident that's Incompetence.  Too many conflicting reports to know if it really Sank.  Need Satellite pics.
victory  ✌ to Ukrainian people's
It was petty officer Benny Hillovich's cigarette what caused the big bang
Great News.
Good shot Sir! 👍🇺🇦👍
Now get ready for this weekend!!! It’s going to be mayhem !!
Dear lord continue to fight for them.
Amen, amen!!!
Hopefully whatever was towing it couldn't get the rope off in time...🤣🤣
glory ukraina 🇺🇦🇺🇦
Let us hope the Russians didn't bring nukes on board. Messy cleanup😑
this is a big deal and must have spared many lives. juicy russian money on the ocean floor
If the ship was not hit by Ukrainian missiles it means that the russians are demilitarizing by themselves 🤔🤔🤔???
Finally arrived to its destination.
So nice! So the Russian story with a cigaret by mistake lid the ammo depot was a lie?.. HAHAH!!!
Little putin and his Last Century soviet army and navy are a huge inept Joke. The world see's now that it was built on Propaganda and Corruption. Nothing more.....
Turkish navy is sailing towards Crimea, it is time Crimean Tatars return their homeland...
Ha!
Glad to see that Russia's 2 day special operation is still on schedule on day 50.
What a metaphor...
❤ Great news !
OMG......how will the trolls and the Kremlin lie about this !!!!
Too bad so sad......kerplunk.
Drones are the real deal
*Ukraine uses cruise missile* *Its super effective critical hit!*
HAHA set Moskva aflame!
i love updates with happy endings
Just need to take out Putin now !!!
Well done Ukraine!!!
the Russians military equipment compliments the Russian mens wear in fashion… very 1970’s 🤣🤣 no wonder the women are everywhere but Russia
:)
I'd love to hear what Putin has to say. 😂😂😂😂  🇺🇦 🇬🇧 I hope these guys attended their swimming lessons.
Does not matter, they have a new one waiting for them in Mykolaïv , the Exact same Slava class, that Ukraine was just about to sell to Brasil...
The new submarine....
The biggest submersible military ship since WW2. Russia just keeps winning
I can't help but laugh. Curious whether the Ukrainians were actually behind it.
The Russians actually scuttled the ship before it could be towed by Ukrainian fishermen.
Yeah! Distracted  by a drone  :-). They had never seen one before.
Well yes Russia said it caught on fire then Ukraine must’ve sunk  it.  Keep up the story is Russia and keep up the actual facts Ukraine!
It wasn't a missile strike, it was a special guided-projectile operation.
Hi it's The Russian Captain, Breaking News - Were are now conducting a special underwater Operation 🤿
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Putin: It's actually a new type of ship we created that turns into a sub.
Ok, there’s no way for an ammunition accident to sink a navy cruiser. Ukraine’s missiles hit it alright. But it sank! Where’s the fire suppression systems? How did it take on water?!? This is Russia’s flagship?!?
They distracted the sailors with a drone and fired missiles at it. How incompetent is the Russian military? Every day is another embarrassment for Putin.
F**k off Russian Warship
Putin: We have successfully transformed this ship to a submarine
F Putin
HA HA!
Russian navy, go f*ck yourselves!   Slava Ukraini!!! 💪💪💪💪💪 Also: Today is the aniversary of the sinking of the Titanic so Putin was always a Kate Winslet fan.
Russian ship successfully intercepted an enemy missile before transforming into a submarine.
Ukraine has sunk the Moskva, but the history books will better remember that Ukraine was the (once) quiet country in eastern Europe that sunk Putin, once and for all. He is doomed to an ugly end, and hopefully, the worst ending any person can imagine.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA loooooolllll
Lord help Ukrainian 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦  🙏
this story makes me smile Slava Ukraine thoughts to the brave people of Ukraine
Good, make the Russian bullies sink. Glory to Ukraine!
hip hip hurray! What lies will Kremlin tell now? Oh yes comrade barbecues  can be very dangerous if unguarded!
The karma bus took a trip to the sea.
Glad to hear!! Hats off to the Ukrainian s!!!!!
Putin: the special sinking operation has been accomplished
Yes!!!! 👏👏👏👏
We need the Titanic (terrible recorder meme) to play in the back. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFrPoissnaw
Ha ha, love it. The Russians are all talk. Slava Ukraine🟦🟨🔱💪💪
Wah waaaaaaaaah.
She never sank. Got promoted to a submarine.
It´s on a Underwaterspezialoperation ;-)
It didn't sink - it extended the special military operation to the marine life.
Russia, always doing good things with environmental conscience...another artificial reef to help sustain the underwater eco system.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Slava Ukraini 🇬🇧🇺🇦🌻💪
The pride of the Black Sea for the Russians. The pride of the deep sea for the Ukrainians.
Lolly lolly lol lol lol 😆
Orcs should stay on land
More to follow!
Putin is a closet homosexual, just like Hitler was. They both have the same complex.
Ukraine are putting up hell of fight
A "special" sinking operation.
Stop believing this disinformation. Putin has confirmed that Moskva is now Russia's first U Boat.
Wow. That's a big hit.
Thanks Lord
Cruise ship, ?? Maybe battle ship.
The irony is, this ship was once the pride of Ukraine...it was built there...
Cruiser Moskva: Today I is mostly being a reef... 🤣😂🤣😂
Its about time
Great news! I just wish Putler was on board when the scrap metal sank.
OMG!! I HOPE this news is correct !!!
Joined VDV underwater it's all according to plan
The russian war ship went and F'd itself  Good Job !
Let's just hope it was loaded with sailors.
The not so mighty russia your army and navy's f#cked! Slava ukraini 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
I don't understand why Russia isn't complaining loudly about an attack on its ship, instead of saying it was an ammunition explosion, since they really seem to take offense to the idea that the Ukraine would dare to protect itself against their invasion.. Perhaps they don't want to admit that such a thing was possible, with their "superior" military technology and all.
1 Down.  A few dozen more to go.  Go Ukraine.
Russian Ministry of Defense: In latest news, our flag ship of the Black Sea Fleet,  Moskva, was converted from a missile cruiser to a stationary submersible. No other country can claim such an advanced ship in their naval arsenal. We expect further conversions in the coming days. More details to come. Praise Putin!
Good to heard that. another vessels are also soonly gona sunk it. Do not to worry about anything. Moskow are not aroud to feel alone lol
Fantastic news. 👍🇺🇦❤️
Haha 😂
So accordin to Russia the damn thing just caught fire on its own dew to technical problems and later sunk by a storm when it was being towed to the port. Dont they realise that this makes them look even more incompetent than just saying "yeah it was damaged because the enemy fired missiles at it" ?
That ship killed 1000 of Ukrainians, it should be at the bottom of the ocean, and Putin with it. Putin and his oligarch billionaire friends have spent to much time on their mega yachts and ignored the condition of the Military, and the Russian people, but they really don’t care as long as they all (Putin/oligarchs) get paid…….
It was sunk to create a new coral reef according to the Kremlin.
That's one embarrassing and difficult choice: accept that the ship was sunk by an adversary or suggest that your crews are so incompetent that they sunk the flagship with no hostile action. Pick your Putin poison.
This is an omen.   Moscow is sunk.
Ukrainians are fighting with intelligence.hitting the flag ship and making their attacks count where as the russians are just throwing bombs wherever.give Ukraine the weapons they want to get the job done. 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦
Made in china boat 😅🤣😂
It didn’t sink, quit lying
Sounds like the Russian wanted the missiles on the ship.
Putin said it was part of his grand plan.  Not a big deal.
New years came early 🎉🥂🍾
Last time Russia lost their flagship, it ended with a revolution. Just saying...
This was a sinking special operation.
Russian military "superiority" sank with the Moskva.
It's called a Russian Sunkmarine! 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 good job Ukraine!
Couldn’t happen to a more deserving bunch .
Russia has been found out to be a 3rd world minimal power.
Get rekt
Russia warship got f...d. Vladimir-blyad.
Oops! The evidence went down with the ship.  Russian warship, go sink yourself.
Rip old timer lol. What an anticlimactic end (for the ship) xD
Good job well done. More ships need to be put on special operations under the sea. Time to send missiles to Russia and to drop bombs on Moscow.
In Russian news: “Our ship is currently de-nazifying mussels, will soon be headed back to base”.
WESTERN MEDIA LIES LIES LIES....IT DIDN'T SUNK!
Let's go !
Give 'em Hell, Ukraine!!
Slava Ukraini ! 👍❤️
Ha!
keep sinkin em
So the Russian are so embarrassed by the Ukrainians that they are claiming their own incompetence sunk the ship? Wow...
Lavarov stated that it was an explosion caused by a loud bang
Good job Ukraine, please continue to contribute to the On Going Artificial Reef Enhancement Program and let Russia pay for it!
Moscow sinking..  ironic🤔
Nice the Moskva learned the Davy Jones locker combination.
Symbolic, yes, but still quite capable.  Had a refit just a few years ago with improved S-300 SAM capability.  May of lacked the VLS of the smaller frigates in the Black Sea but was a significant naval gunfire and anti-shipping threat as well.
Hell yeah!
It is now first of Moskva class submarines 😂😂😂
Good ridens full stop.
It's on a special underwater operation
Don't think the ammo went up at all...me thinks a missile hit the captain's secret vodka stash...ship had no chance after that
AHAHHAHAHHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAH))))
Good riddance to bad rubbish!
That is fake. The ship has been reclassified as a submarine and is now denazifying the floor of the Black Sea.
"No comrade, eet was not heet by Ukrainian missile, it was......moose & squirrel!". Lol, yesterday it was explained as a minor fire....today, Davy Jones locker. I would call the Russian military a clown car at this point but, my god, that'd be so unfair to the clowns.
"Special underwater Operation"  Code named " who lives in a Pineapple under the sea?"
They only joined ongoing special submarinal operation in Black Sea.
God bless Ukraine. ♥️👍
more money russia has not got oh dear
Flagship sunk. Sounds like a bad omen.
Good job F Putin
simply relocating itself  acording to plan!!!
I believe the Russian story 🤣🤣 well done Ukraine 👍👍👍
And everything is going according to plans. VLADIMIR PUTIN.
So it did f...k itself?
Distracted the crew with a drone, then kaboom. Hit the Moskva with 2 Neptune missiles!   (Cheering in my Ukrainian American house.)
Woohoo, Imagine Putin is a little bit pissed off LOL :P
Glad to hear it sank, I hope Tucker Carlson can hold back his tears.
Yesssss!!!!!!!
Well that news brightened up my day a bit.
YES YES WELL DONE UKRAINE!!!!!
🌻🌻🌻
First Russian flag ship to be sunk since the Russo Japanese war 1904-1905 ...
Just think if it had nuclear on board.
Ukraine : WE SANK THE MOSKOVA! Putin: Ukraine is incapable of sinking our great ship. We sank it ourselves!
It was an explosion caused by a loud bang, said lavarov
spontaneous combustion ...  and now they hid the evidence ...
According to Russian's government:  The ship was sunk by "Water Special Operation" not from Ukraine or the West.
I see the Russians are hastily moving the rest of their fleet in case they accidentally catch fire aswell...
Relax, it is a special operation submarine now, that's what Putin says.
Moscow sinks.    Yeah i know that since February 24.
Greetings from Ukraine and thanks for support to all civilization world!  #armforukraine 🇺🇦
that would be awesome!  still waiting for some evidence though
Massive victory for the Ukrainian Navy and the People of Odessa. The Neptune Missile was a new development so cool it works on the first actual target and may save untold number of Ukrainian lives now the ship sank.
Can we finally admit the Russian military is a complete joke. A  missile  cruiser should have robust missile defense system.
"special sleeping with the fishes operation"
😂😂
The conversion of Moskva from cruiser to submarine is now complete. Next stop: bottom of the Black Sea.
On another channel, when someone else said the Russian battleship was too big to sink, I responded, "God himself could not sink this ship," hoping it would jinx _Moskva_ like it did _Titanic_ . Maybe it worked? ;)
Putin is finished. Grow up the rest of the civilized word.
One less battleship in the Russian Black Sea fleet? These are great news! Keep them coming. 😀👍
If only Putin was on it
"Missile Cruise Ship" haha! "Cruiser" perhaps?
Damn
let me get this right - the Ukranians got two missiles to land on it and declared that. This forced the Russians to quickly  lie (again) and say there was a mysterious accidental fire on board - and THEN they towed it into a port!! good grief they really are Orcs these Russians. They now have a sunken ship, probably in the largest berth in the port! WOW,  way to go Einstein.
It will make a great home for the sea creatures.
Hurraaaa...!!!
HMS very sinkable 🤣
So much for the vaunted russian military might . Quality of russian hardware leads much to be desired. Not surprised they are getting beaten so easily
Slava Ukraini!
Wanted wanted wanted putin
Glory to Ukraine she will make good fish habitat.
It's a submarine now according to Russia
Way to go, Ukraine!!
🤣 Flagship sunk 🤣
well done. another humilation for the aggressors
🤣🤣🤣👏👏👏👏🇬🇧🇬🇧🇺🇦🇺🇦
So they actually f’d themselves? Lol
good riddance good job
Good show!
not sunk. just turned into submarine - its russian "super secret special operation"
FAAFO RUSSIA! 🚢 💣💥🤿 BYEEEE FOCKERS!!👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼
I’m not sure Finland and Sweden have anything to worry about if they join NATO.  Russians are just incompetent at this war thing.
No doubt the Brits , carried out this attack .  Their Royal Marines specialize in  this type of underwater attack .
great
Hell yeah 💪💪
So that's now 2 of Russian most valuable ships sunk in the black sea. I wonder how many more generals will have "heart attacks" tonight 🤔
Moskow installed the wrong firmware updates over the air.  The Moskva got the ones intended for submarines.
Well done #Ukraine !!!
A guided missile cruiser that guided missiles both ways? How nice of them!
Lol no one can even either agree if it sank or was damaged
Good job
Glory to uktraine,i stand with uktraine.
Basically Russia has spent the last decade bullshitting on youtube then actually believed their own BS 🤣🤣🤣
The Moskva has successfully carried out its orders to..... "go f*** itself"
Awesome 👌
Waiting for the fisherman who tows the wreck home.
lol
It didn‘t sunk! It is just full of water 🤣
Now two smaller ones to go. Then flatten the Russian basis in Crimea so Ukraine ships can get out again.
The world's first convertable ship. it can turn into a submarine.
Ukraine : I've sunk your Battleship!!
Maybe this highly skilled Russian Captain sank his own ship to put the fire out!!!!! I think that's what the Russian line will be!!! There no way that the comrade putin would allow the HEROIC UKRAINIANS to sink his flag ship. I think comrade putin needs to be very careful with his sailors smoking in bed!!! As another one of his ships may just catch fire!!!
Ukraine is killing them iron curtain bitches ,keep at it
Pity there's no footage of it sinking...would have made my day seeing that.
Hopefully more Russian ships can be hit to the point of total damage like this one. Every small damage in Putin's war machine sparks our hope in the hope that it will lead to Russian overall loss in this last battle. On top of our hope is that the Russian army grows some degree of discontment to lead to a revolution in Russian military. Could it happen ?
I hear Russian media are reporting it as Russia's new submarine.
Phaaa ha the Russians are so 1960s 🤣🤣🤣
Ship followed suit of Russian ruble.
Did the guy survive after telling poootin🤣😅🤣
The Russians should spin this that the ship courageously put itself in the line of fire to stop the missiles from hitting and sinking one of their ships. I'm sure enough useful idiots out there will blindly believe that.
Send in the Admiral Kuznetsov is can barely float on it's own - Russian junk
So, the Russian warship f***ed itself, according to Russia.
Misleading news is not sink. Propaganda news
A real good hit to Ruskie Navy!!!!!🙋🏻‍♂️✌🏻❤🇺🇦☠☠☠🔥
Putin needs to declare defeat and withdraw his military from Ukraine. Go Ukraine 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Go on, Ukraine 😄 🇺🇦
As a ‘goodwill gesture’, we, the Russian federation sunk our finest warship.
The Russians looked for war, now they get there war.
Vodka is a hell of a drug.  V. Putler is popping his rubber ducky's eyes out now  🇺🇦  !  Russian tanks and naval vessels have identical evacuation procedures, cover ears and ride the blast wave through the bulkhead.
Free Ukraine 🇺🇦❤️🇬🇧
The Makarena heroically destroyed 2 missiles then proceeded to go onto a secret underwater mission.
I doubt even the most brainwashed Russian citizens will accept it sank because of the accidental fire. But as good as it is for moral the west mustn’t get complacent and war fatigued. Putin hopes we will get bored and turn our attention away from his war. West must push on, must defeat Putin. Forever.
Wunderbare Nachricht. Es lebe die Ukraine.
Let Russia and Ukraine work out their own problems, we have a worse problem in America called the democrats
Maybe Zelensky Tiktokers sunk it 😂
submarine it is
How embarrassing! 8 ships destroyed by a country that has no Navy.
Tentara ukraina menyerahlah demi rakyat bergabunglah dengan Rusia..jangan ikuti pemimpin yang mengkhianati rakyatnya..#Rakyat Indonesia Rusia URAAA
GOOD
Jesus works in such wonderful ways !!!
Next Putin! Praise GOD!
''special submarine class''
this would be like sinking 2 american aircraft carriers.
Nice!!
Great stuff! :)
Don’t forget Russia used Fox GQP propaganda to support their genocide.
No no it's looking for Kursk
Well done ukraine 🇺🇦 🇮🇪
Funny we have heard about this for a few days, BUT ZERO evidence. In a few days it will be,  Russian have fixed there ship
Bravo Great job Ukrainian military! Go Rambo Go!🏹😎🤙👍…got blown up by Ukrainian Neptune missiles!  Don’t believe what Russian saying full of 💩💩💩💩💩!.🤪….🇺🇦💙💛…From🇺🇸✌️
Good am surprised they didn't say they sank it on purpose 🤣
I'm do sad! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
waiting for reliable photo evidence. Usually Ukraine makes fake news, so I doubt it
Now,  Moskva the cruiser, has sunk. Next, Moscow, the capital.
SLAVA UKRAINI !!!! ✊🟦🟨🟦🟨🟦🟨🟦🟨
The flagship is not "MOKVA" but Moscow!!!!!
incoming hundreds of jokes about a special underwater operation
Neptune is King. 😐
Good news
I hope they will sink the remaining fleet
Russian Media; Moskva have not sunk, it has just submerged underwater to take cover.
What’s with propaganda we all know people got off this safe,fire was onboard let’s be honest west losing war Ukraine just surrended 1000 marines and British fighters have also been caught it’s embarrassing loss for West stop trying to divert!
The Captain of the Moskva will probably disappear.
Finland and Sweden can STOP this war if they promise that they will stay NEUTRAL if Russia will leave Ukraine. Russia could accept this because NATO didn't defend Ukraine and will not defend Finland and Sweden if they are attacked by Russia. So, for Russia is more acceptable that Ukraine is NATO and Finland and Sweden stay NEUTRAL than Sweden and Finland in NATO and having war FULLY supported by NATO in Ukraine.
Ha💩🇷🇺
woohoooo!!!
Good.  Dead orks and scrapped equipment is always welcome news.
Hope there where no nukes on board.
love it
I didn't quite get it yet. Did the ship sink?
Excellent news 👏  🇺🇦✌️
No it is searching the ocean floor for communication cables   which have to be cut .MAYBE   .. MAYBE NOT.
The ship didn't sink. It was a special operation to convert it into a submarine.
[Neptune has entered the chat] Moskva: 👁👄👁
Karma
Good
”the Moskva ”was a guided missile cruiser of the Russian Navy. She was the lead ship of the Project 1164 Atlant class and was named after the city of Moscow. She was the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet  She was sunk in a ” special military operation “ by the armed forces of Ukraine 🇺🇦 glory to Ukraine
/jeremy clarkson smug face
Maybe Putin can go down in a submersible and inspect the damage. He might find some Ionian urns. 😂🤣🚀⚓️ 🛳 🧜‍♀️ 😂🤣
IS there any nuclear weapons aboard???
Efefk Putin.
Get your facts straight. It has fallen heroicly in a special operation against stormy weathers.
I wish there was video.
Hooray
Well done Ukraine!
is it possible for a huge steel vessel to be sunk by a fire? doesn't it need a hole somewhere one shouldn't be in order to sink?
Great news indeed - it’s now sunk - whether it was Ukraine that hit it or error on board causing a fire - all is good news - Russia needs to be disabled in every direction - we are so tired of dictators and evil murderers - shame
😅🤣😭😭😭🤣😭😭🤣🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
YAY good job ukraine!
Geez. "Missile cruise ship"? Really?
"Russian warship...go f*** yourself." Hahahahahaha!!
Slava UKRAINI 🌻🇺🇦🌻🇺🇦🌻🇺🇦🌻🇺🇦🌻🇺🇦🌻
What? This is the scariest battleship of the Russian navy. Rodrigo Duterte must be broken hearted he visited that ship whenever it make port call in Manila.
Russian ships in the Black Sea are vulnerable as are its soldiers in Ukraine. What should Russia do now? Withdrawing from Ukraine completely would be a good idea. Glory to Ukraine 🇺🇦
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Its true, the ammunition on the Moskva went on fire and caused an explosion............after the ship being hit by 2 Missiles,lol 😂
Now go and sink the real Moskva too
Ukraine sunk Moskva! exactly 110 years ago Titanic sunk.
Camouflaged submarine.
Fantastic news. Well done Ukraine.
The Bismarck history repeat again😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Made my day!
But still Ukraine is losing, but in propaganda war, with the help of fork tipped tongue western media the west is winning. 😂
Wonder if there was nukes on board....would be interesting to know.
Im so happy for that u dont belive how much. Slava ukraine 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦 .
A drone and 3 vodka bottles hanging down. Hey Ivan lets create a pyramid. Hold my cigg....
Yay SLAVA Ukraine
👍👍👍
Chaos in Russia.
CHAMPAGNE after the FIREWORKS!!!  🍾🍾🍾👍👍
This war by Putin is proof that when government runs everything, NOTHING WORKS. THINK before we allow the liberal left to control our lives!!
Good job ,keep it up
If the Russian story about "ammunition exploding" was true it would be far worse than being hit by a Ukrainian missile.
Well, Russia _did_ say the fires had been put out.  Sinking will do that.
Good for Ukraine. keep them supplied with anti ship missiles and sink the rest!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  Absolutely bloody hilarious 😂 😃 😄 😁
The humiliation .  Russia -  limitation damage operation>  lies :   it was a ....fire  of "unknown origin".  then a storm hit at made it sink.  🤣🤣🤣
🥳🥳☺️
Slava Ukraine! Continue the good fight. There won't be peace as long Putin continues with bullying
awesome but wheres the footage?
And this is Russias Flag ship 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Probably caused by an Alien UFO but certainly not by the Ukrainians.... :)
Russia blew it up themselves, not Ukraine, Russia is so incapable that they destroyed their own flagship. "That" is what Russia is going with "we are so stupid that we destroyed our own flagship". Hilarious.
Slava Ukraini!
On June 26, 1941, in front of the Port of Constanta, one of the most powerful Soviet  warships in the Black Sea - the destroyer "Moskva" was sunk. Looks like  the name is made to sink. Only 150km between spots. It seems  history repeats itself.
A symbolic sinking for a symbolic presence.
It wasnt towed anywhere nor was it a fire that caused the damage 🤣😂   Two neptune missiles hit the ship and one hit the ammo store which set that off which was the cause of the fire.   The ship wasnt towed anywhere when it sank that is clear from sos signals radio and morse from the ship which indicated the entire ship listed very quickly and began sinking. This was mid a storm with heavy winds and rain too also the water there is arround 0°...  They had no chance to get tuggs towing a listed ship during a heavy storm... the russian military and kremlin are being liars as they usually are... Imagine having the audacity to lie to the families of those sailors... Disgusting.
Another defeat for putin. At this point i just nuked ukraine.
120 russian oil tankers full of oil no place to go
So the country that has no navy sinks the nuclear rocket cruiser
Wait for the response now.They won't like that.
Hahahahaha. Slava Ukraini! 🇺🇦
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Slava Ukraini.  Glory to the heroes!
Too bad the crew didn't go down with it....
Guys, pls, check the date when Titanic was sunk.  U will be wonder. I promise u
following the long russian naval tradition of being useless then sinking
Dispute. Would they rather say their sailors are such idiots they blew up their own ship? Or it was an attack lol
Well, I guess now there's no way to verify that it was or wasn't hit by Ukrainian missles. That's super convenient...
Its now a symbolic presence on the sea bed.  Lets hope it was not carrying nuclear warheads.
(Nelson voice) HAHA!
YESSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's an upgrade, folks. From a cruiser to a submarine😁
the Russians said the evacuated all sailors??????? to where ? Heaven or Hell
And this is the kind of ship that will attack an American carrier group? 😂😂😂!
Sunk?  No no no, it's a Special Underwater Operation.  Get it right, Sky News.
Cool
Huzzah! I love it when a story has a happy ending👍
Nah, it's just a "special submarine operation" 😂
Hopefully it sunk & blocked the entrance to the russian port...
Well they should have no trouble replacing it as they are so rich... oh, wait... 🤭 Slava Ukraine 💙 💛
Ukraine does have these Neptuns and will get Harpoons so there's more fun coming to russians in the near future :D
The Ukrainian freedom fighters did the Russians a favor. Get rid of an old ship. They can always build another one.
'Rest in peace' /;)
Yay
Makje for a good diving vacation spot to see all the tropical fish that make it home now. LOL
There must have been hevy casualties, but Russia's will not admit to!
"Mokva" 🙄 "Missile cruise ship" 🤦  Jeez, please! Make sure the announcer gets the most basic things right!
Whatever the cause is but the good news is it's no more, I believe it was full of weapons to kill and destroy.
Every other attack has video. This would be great footage.
I'd like to see proof, rather than believe MSM..
Wow Epic WIN For UKRAINE!!! Slava Ukraini!!!
Technically, the RU MoD is not completely lying, there was indeed a fire!  Seriously, people have to stop believing Russia's lies.  They have less GDP than Italy, which is 1/14th that of the USA (with all due respect to Italy, which I love).  They (RU) simply cannot afford a modern army or even maintain and operate an outdated one.  Paper tiger.  Lies are free.  Freedom, however, is not.  Glory to Ukraine!
Slava Ukraine!!
Ha ha
Cheers 🥃🥃 it's now a 🐟🎏 special operation ☺️
Russia said operation not  invasion Ukraine ,this time warship was destroyed by missiles Ukraine ,Russian said no,no , it exploded itselft .😅😅
Lol
Of coarse it was caused by the heros Ukrainians. On board munitions would be ignited. Glory to Ukraini!!! 💙💛🇺🇦
Russia may have sunk the ship due to nuclear contamination.
That's expensive...
It was Russian navy major anti-aircraft asset in the Black Sea and insured control of the skies over much of southern Ukraine.  A huge blow to Russian navy.
Now it can join the Kursk at the bottom of the ocean.
Coming Soon: video of ukrainian fishermans towing back to the shore russian military boats.
Slava Ukraini
yaaaaaaaaaay !
It didn't sink, it's a special underwater operation.
👍👍👍👍🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
That's sad 😂
Putin-"The Moskva hasn't sunk! It has been promoted to a nuclear submarine! Anyone who disagrees, relax now go to Gulag!"
Do the Russians expect sympathy? Slava Ukraine!!
Yay! ONWARD! Up next, SAVE MARIUPOL!
Glory to Ukraine 🇺🇦💪🇬🇧👏
Imagine losing your best ship to a country without a navy 😂😭💀🇺🇦

It’s conducting a special operation at the bottom of the Black Sea 👇  Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦
it is a good start
Good
Special diving operation!  And now the real Moskva should go down.
It has f...itself into a special  military  submarine
Putin will follow it.
Long live Ukraine from the uk
It's a special underwater operation 😂😂😂
The ship got promoted to submarine operations
Kremlin: It hasn’t sunk - it’s on a special underwater operation.
There's going to be a lot more "fires" mysteriously happening aboard Russia ships.
Fantastic news
sounds like there happened some serious fire accident on the battleship 😁🖕🖕🖕
They have "RIA News." We have CNN. Same credibility. Same Marxist intentions.
Rofl
She was old but went down fighting in a war
好 ！好 ！ 好 ！爽 ！爽 ！爽 ！
Losing more than a billion of dollar, please enjoy. 🙏
Wa waa waaaa
Good
0:16 "Moskva missile cruise ship". It's a Missile Cruiser! Not the B*******G Symphony of the Seas!
Wow... Russia just can't win at all. Maybe they will think twice about invading another country.....
Bye byeeeeee
That's awsome, and they haven't received the British Harpons yet.
Yes!!!  Any idea how many cruise missiles went down with it?
More Russian scrap metal.... LMFAO
Haaaaa  classic —-  God bless the Ukrainian soldiers 👍 they’re so creative . Sunk  billion dollar ship 😂😂🇺🇸🇺🇸🕊🇺🇦❤️👍🇺🇦🇺🇦🕊🕊🕊🕊🌴🦜 Love from Florida USA
The main mission of the Russians ships during all their naval history was one thing: to sink bravely and heroically at certain place at designated time.
GREAT news good job Ukraine SLAVA UKRAINE!
"The larger army must conquer the smaller army to achieve victory." - Art of War Sun Tzu. (Paraphrase)
Does the ship carry nukes ?
Sure it sank???? I believe nothing Russia says.... If it is true, then Way to go Ukraine!!
good riddance 👏 ❤ 🇺🇦
Yayyyyyyyyyy
Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦
Everything is going according to plan.
If that ship has sunk, I would put my life on it that ship was hit by a sub probably America.
Slave Ukraine! Send the butchers to hell
WELL DONE! UKRAINE ...BRAVO👋👋👋
Nobody knows what Putin is fighting for or against.  This war unfortunately will end with Russian nukes destroying the west.
YES! I just hope no sailors were injured or killed, but wishing the worst for Putin and his henchmen.
f u russian warship
CNN reported "Mostly peaceful fire broke out on Noble Russian Ship"
So The Russian Defense Ministry has upgraded Moskva’s condition from “severely damaged” to “sunk”
This is just too priceless. Russian warship, go f.. yourself 😂 Go Ukraine!
Wonderful news. Ukraine 1 Russia 0 at half time.
need to make a movie now. "Sink the Moskva!"
Actually, Putin has announced it was always part of the plan to convert the Moskva into a submarine, and the Russian forces continue to execute flawlessly on the plan.
The "Special War Crimes Operation" is sinking without trace - a bit like their ship
It didnt sink, it went to perform a special seabed military observation
Russia tells world, "We create artificial reef for Ukraine."
So did it get sunk or towed back somewhere? I am super confused.
They say that the cruiser "Moscow" did not sink, but heroically destroyed 2 anti-ship missiles, after which it made a negative surfacing and was transferred to the class of submarines
Moskva going down faster than Putin's Global Popularity
Excellent news!!!
The ship wasn't sunk!! It took part in a 'rapid decommissioning operation', during which time it was promoted to submarine for its role in intercepting two Ukrainian missiles - with its face.
I'm pretty sure Switzerland has a better navy.
Hurray...next stop, send some ICBM/s into Putin's Red Square parade on May 9th....then game over! Who ever was the Captain...it is the gulag for ya...silly billy! lol
Это серьезно плохое предзнаменование для путинской войны. он должен был проконсультироваться с предсказатель перед началом своей спецоперации. Слава Украины
Great news, better than the story of the Bismarck in WW2!
Mistakes after mistakes
Russian navy successfully intercepted two missiles with cruiser Moskva!
Good!
I believe that this is the largest naval ship to be sunk in action since 1945. Unless someone knows otherwise. (Belgrano slightly smaller)
Russian bots 'Yeah....let's refrain from commenting on this video, eh?' 😅
This is skeptical for me the Russians Announce  that their ship has been sunk while towing heading to sevastopol. They doesn't care about shame it seems the Russians are very transparent and truthful to their loses. Another thing is what if the Russians literally sunk the ship.. So it make an Excuse to break the negotiation in Istanbul.
I'm surprised they didn't say it was a "special underwater operation". Well done Ukraine.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👏👏👏👏💥💥🏴‍☠️😁
An artificial reef has been established off Sevastopol - Peskov.
ha-ha 🇺🇦
Fantastic news
This is the ship they used for the song "Moscow never sleeps" well... night bae
Special underwater operation
Russian warships are now being built with glass bottoms so they can view the rest of their fleet....
Wonderful news!!  Slava Ukraini!
This a seriously bad omen for Putin's war. he should have consulted a  soothsayer before starting his special operations. Slava Ukraini
What a total embarrassment for Russia. Pathetic Tanks, Armour and ships. Well done Ukraine totally out playing the aggressor....
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣👍💙💛💙💛💙💛🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇸❤️❤️❤️
What a great news, well done UA. Think the Russian navy will keep distance from the Ukrainian coast now.....
Fodeu-se
YAY !!!!!!
The irony of this is just amazing!
The front fell off.
Sink the rest of them.
i wish i could be a fly on the wall of putins office  when he hears this
Can't even imagine the celebration from the Ukrainians when the missles struck the cruiser. Hopefully there's a video out there
Oh dear ! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. Glug glug. Go Ukraine 🇺🇦👍👍👏👏🇬🇧
That's great 👍
Every day a new proof of Russian incompetence. Every paper tiger feels offended being compared to Russian military
More bloody Russian scrap. Greenpeace need to blockade Russia to protect the environment and stop the Russians Turning even more stuff into waste.
HAHAHAHAAHA. That's some flagman! What a bunch of losers these russians are
IT HAS NOT SUNK!! its conducting Special Under Water Operations!
So it "f-ed off" after all
clearly it was time to make more coral reef in that spot.  hope everyone's safe.
What? I thought it was just injures
So the real truth is that about 450 crewmen died and about 50 were saved. While first Russia media telling us every single 500 member was saved without a scratch. Yeah right...Russians really don't care about their own dead. I hear rumours that Moskva will rise from the depths of Black Sea one day to free Russia from Putler with it's ghost crewmen.
Now if this true Rusia will flatern ukrain now it's over four them Kyiv will be flatern d now
👍👍👍
Just like Russia’s economy 😂😂😂
Wtf. 😂
Good!!!
Can we sink the entire Russian state now please
That's one down, two to go. Two Russian Missile Frigates remain in the black sea as far as I know.
I guess they had a bunch of wiring problem in all those tanks also!
😂 nato proganda is Hilarous
Russian citizens don't believe this. Its a joke. And know at bottom of the sea
It is repurposed to find its "father" that sunk in WWII
Not sunk. But promoted to submarine.
ahaahahahhaahahahahahahahaa
Looks like the famous phrase was prophetic indeed. The warship did indeed go and f*ck itself. Lmao
Hahahaha ha😆hahahahahahah😆ahahaha. Haha😆hahahahahahahahaha hahahahahahah😆ahahahaha 😆hahaha😆😆hahahahahaha😆hahahahahahah😆
Very good news, we are expecting same news
ive said all along sink the ships ,this is a big game changer for our Friends Ukraine
Anything that Ukraine attacks that is Russian, Russia will say it magically caught fire and is being investigated
Congratulations 🎉
Excellent...Putin should be tossed overboard into a school of great whites.....they'd probably spit him out...  Oh and by the way....Moskva has now been renamed Kursk!
Keep stong Russia
Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
lol
It didn't sink, it dived
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸❤❤❤❤🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦💪💪
"Sink the Moskva" was the battlecry that shook the seven seas!
According to Russia they have been fooling everyone for 40 years with their ingenuity and it’s really a submarine
We can use it as a scuba diving attraction.
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺😡😡😡😡😈😈😈😈
Couldn't have happened to a nicest country and bunch of blokes, I am truly gutted!
The quality of their equipment is so bad...
Has World War 3 started yet?
Good!
"Distracted with a drone!" - classic!
Tactical Sinking Operations
First Ukrainians said they hit it with a missile, then the Russians claim it was just a fire. If the Russians were right how would the Ukrainians have even known about it? Ukrainians sank the ship, no question.
So sky news can watch Russian news but we can't 😂😂😂
Meh.  These things happen.  -Russian media
It is just special U-boat conversion operation. Nothing to see here.
YES!!!!! 🤣
Not sunk it is carrying out submarine excersises
Lol get wrecked putler
Putin thinks better to blame incompetence than battle. Bizarre
Is this the Green Signal? 🧐
Yes, yes, yes!
Russia are pushies. That's a FACT
Yet no photo of it sinking sure
Lovely !
It didn't sink, it performed a "one way submarine maneuver".  😂
What a shame 🇺🇦
Gimme a break...
Lmao
💣🚢🇬🇧✌️
