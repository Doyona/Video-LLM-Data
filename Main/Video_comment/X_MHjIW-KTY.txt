Beautiful deck!!!
So deep in binging older episodes! Occy- ❤
I'll have a back message thank you.😜
So, do you do *both* Better Health *and* Headspace?  If so, do they work together on propose or are you doing each on the sly from the other?
I feel like Fig Tree Farm would be a cute name for the property
The "DECK" subtitle when you said really big deck hahhahaha
Why are you renting a digger when you bought an excavator????
How do you spell OCD? M.A.X. Love it.   You have the knack of climbing into everyone's head and heart Max. The friends who have appeared and assisted you with menial labour during their vac time are incredible keepers. Thanks for your help Simon, another legend appears on the Max and Occy channel! The two of you have made building your deck effortless, and fun. Dig here, dig there, and I don't mean holes. The dawgs are amazing. So well socialized. Occy just proved his superiority over Jake. If something gets to a dog they usually just piss on it, kick up some dust and walk away! Well done Occy. Don't get mad, get even!!!  So good to have your mom visiting you. Mothers are the most precious commodity in life!
Addicted to your videos and your  adventures , and all The Underdogs Show Dogs love Occy.
An amazing build.  Simon is an amazing mate.  Whoever reported you, I think must be jealous!  You Mom is beautiful.  Loved this project.
I've watched all of these videos about the land but I still don't know where the mosquitos live?
Hey max weare looking at a van build and just interested in your opinion on the iveco daily van please  Thank grant
always smiling after one of your videos ! thank's a lot !😍😍🤩🤩
That decking looks stunning.  Cannot wait to see the roof part.  That looks like a solid ladder in the making.
so privileged to have ur mum x
I'm catching up - well done to Simon for all his hard work and your neighbour...it looks amazing!
I’m so glad that I came to check on you and you had a new project going!  Now I’ll catch up while I’m organizing some cabinets.
Good to see ya Mum!! Bloody brilliant Man and Occy!!!
I've been a silent watcher for a very very very long time, and your video's just bring me so so much joy, have a constant smile on my face watching your adventures and projects. What an amazing life you have built for yourself... thanks for bringing such happiness and peace to your viewers screens!
I didn't think a ytube channel made that much money. I've got green eyes lol😮
Do you have a video of your vanlife internal layout?
OMG! Your deck is beautiful and that view! Awesome job! Thanks to Simon, Jake and Jack for helping Max & Occy! Max enjoy your time with your Mom!❤️🙏🏼👍🏼👍🏼✌🏼❤️🥰🐶🐶🥰
WOW ! It’s a masterpiece and you mom!! Oh my gosh, little droplets of water coming from my eyes haha ❤ love to see your mama. I’ll be catching up on the newest video tomorrow. So glad for you Max. It’s coming together so impeccably beautiful and your craftsmanship really shows.
Cooooooeeeeeee Ok, so you are missed, when are you coming back?
What a well designed and built deck and lookout! A great idea. Simon, what a guy. Poor Occy, he chased you around on the machinery until he completely pooped himself out. That’s a herding dog for you.
Mom, son, and a beautiful Aussie Shepard! Family and health is everything!
What is your better help reference please max?
I think Occy needs a day at the beach 🐶
Enough now Max, we need some more footage…..holiday time is over  we miss you and Occy
Dale would be proud of those holes indeed. Great looking deck!
Where are u!
OMG… the shirt is off 😍
Your friend is super nice
So glad your mom came.    You're VERY talented
'dale dug a hole' classic......am from Canada but 'The Castle' is a cult classic in our home!  Especially Dennis Denuto and the Photo Copier.......Beep!  Great Vid!
28:30 That right there is all worth it ☺ I love what the bond with our furry friends does for us. Peace right there.
3:16 "We're building this deck for Occy." As you should! The real show stealer  Love that Occy is finally getting a deck, 100% worth it!
Will there be a new video this weekend??
Mom and son together🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
RAD!!
First watch of your channel.  Really enjoyed it.  Can't wait to see the second level of your awesome deck.  Enjoy your visit with your Mum. 💞 ⚘.
Sunscreen +sweat+eyes = not nice!! Looks amazing. Lucky mum getting to be the first to stay there.  Nice job Max, Simon and Dale 😆
You both did a great job. Very creative deck. 👍
Occy is really aging. Blessings.
Hey Max I really need your Max & Occy merch Tshirt 😮
great vid . . . thanks Max and Occy
This is such an awesome video. I've been meaning to get into meditation too! The headspace offer is too goo to pass up!
Going to be sad when occy dies.   I lost 2 back to back couple years ago.
You have a beautiful mom!!!
🫶🏼
Wow this was a great video! Even learned a little about building a deck through it too! Thanks for sharing this process and I hope you and your mom are enjoying the time together!!
What a beautiful woman is your mom :-) Enjoy your time and thanks for sharing this moments with us
Looks fabulous hope you are not being affected by the fires up north
💜💙💚
Occy took control of the situation  Hes not having it, nope. The shenanigans stop at Occy
Wow! Max, you did an awesome job! I bet your mum is so proud of you- not just for the build, but for the amazing person you have become.  Thanks for sharing your life with us!
You with you mom....adorable!
I wish you a wonderful time in your van. Yes, going in silence is wonderful. I do this daily, without taking other things. I LOVE it to go in silence. It's the best what we can do. WE ARE ALL......UNIVERSE.......LOVE........ENERGY. It's the best before I going to sleep. Also as a powernaping. Also in the morning before I stand up. I also do it, when I am in the forest. I wish you always a wonderful time, with all what you do. Nice to see you and your wonderful place. Lovely greetings from germany
Wow! I’m so impressed….you did it for your mum…love
Thank you Simon. Nice job.
Fantastic job. Lovely to meet your Mum too. You're blessed to have great helpful friends too , no doubt. All the best with your project Max.
Sweet! Great job mate!
Your Mom is so beautiful!  Hope you enjoyed your time with her!  I bet Occy loves her!  Deck looks great!
beautiful property and beautiful mum!
Simon is a legend!
Wow, just wow!
Bigger shoulders than Eamon 🤣
Amazing!! Love your new van deck, well done!
Great video (as always), and your Mom is beautiful.
Great job Max, Simon and Occy..!!! Such a great addition to an amazing space
BEST reason in the world to rush and get thay deck done! ❤
Hey Max, I thought I'd jump on here and officially apologise for jumping you at the mullum markets the other day lol. I'm so sorry that must of been so strange, I realised after that must of been so random for you. Anyways it was lovely to meet you and Occy in person, I hope your time with the fam has been nourishing! Your place is looking great, the shire is a special place hey! Big love legend, keep up the good work! Tahra x
I love painting as it’s relaxing and always so transformative. Your deck looks pretty awesome and should last you a good long while! You have some good friends!😊
I think your taking too much time and money making this extra area, when you actually should  be working on the house...but thats just my thoughts.
it looks so good. you & occ meditating on the deck 🥰
Wow, Great Deck!  Look forward to see all additions!  So glad you had Simon and your neighbor to help.  So great to share the work.  Have a great time with your Mum!
How lovely that your mum came to visit!🤗 She seems to be a beautiful person on the in and outside! She has raised you 👍 Great that your neighbours help you out, they know you are as good as gold, and that is what you attract - beautiful people … and dogs of course! 🤗
WOW! You really,once again, have new good friend! Cheers to Simon for helping You & Ocky with with your, soon to be, deck! You guys are really one of a kind! 🤩🙌❤
I Would do the same thing with the 'blobs' Max. You're right to keep the moisture away from the wood posts.
A deck fit for a queen :)
Deck! 😅
Dear Max, I love each and every single one of your videos and «be kind.always» is a wonderful everyday reminder about the most important thing ever. But if I may I would like to give you some well meant advice concerning your life in the forrest: Don't moan the grass every week. The little insects need it to live, the grass stores a lot of water and protects the soil underneath and the diversity of plants increases when you leave the grass grow more. And please don't turn all the green into decks and similar things. Take a chair and sit in the garden, every inch built on is an inch less for nature. I'm not a professional (I just learnt quite a lot over the past years) and my English is not perfect, but I'm sure, you can find a lot of information online to biodiversity and similar topics. I can also recommend the movie The biggest little Farm. One of the most amazing and inspiring films I've ever watched! <3
Beautiful work!
Max, your hard work will pay off, it’s going to be beautiful! Great plan to give yourself leeway on the house build! Your views are amazing 😮
Love the deck 💕 looking forward to seeing the whole property unfold 😊
Should host woofers to help you progress the property!
💗❣️💗⭐💙😇💖♥️❤️
Occy just goes with the flow...😂
I'm so happy to see you guys wearing masks, when mixing concrete.  So many people don’t and I think it’s a huge health issue. Work is looking great.
You did an epic job on thae deck.Nice to see your mom visiting you.
Great vid mate! 🤙
You boys sorted the framework so well - great job!  The ecodecking boards are fantastic and will give you years of enjoyment - only need a mild detergent and pressure to make them look like new and remove any dirt. ✅  Looking awesome Max , enjoy the time with ya mum! ❤️💕
The world needs more Max and Occy! You're wonderful! 💗💗💗
Decks looking great , what a change for the property. I would consider triangulation on those posts before you intend to put a platform on top.   Cheers and safe travels     Steve h.
Woww love you video  Love your dog. Meditation is so power it has changed my life without I would not be here today. Thankyou.
Max you really go above and beyond!
Max please get rid of the mullet cmon man😂
Another banger project Max!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
That looks great!  33:28 your mother is so pretty.  Love what you are doing with the deck.  Looks really good!  Thumbs up.
Watching ockey getting older is a little sad , these really Speacial friends are with us for such a short time but they see us through so much crap in life…
Can't wait for the next videos
Well done guys ...what a champion you are Simon
Loving the deck Max and Simon , and that was a lot of holes!! Max how can we buy a tshirt they are super cool ??
Love it… now you need to make Occy his own little steps right down to his little jungle hide away.                       🐶🌴🌿🌳🍄
I love your new build and it was such a sweet surprise that it was your mama coming for her first visit to your piece of paradise  💙
How sweet of you to have the deck ready for your mom❤❤❤
Your mum must be so proud and what a beautiful place to be able to come to
It looks amazing! Love the wood colour. Is it difficult to reverse into?
I love painting! Best part of DIY haha
Lol the mullet lives on
I can't wait to see what you have in store for that space!
Stunning, how lovely to have your mum enjoy that lovely decking and wild life.
Wow very much into Detail. You are doing things only once I guess Max. Simon you are a legend🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤😊😊😊.
Great job Max! 👌🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇬🇧
Lol occy eating the stick so jake didn’t get it! ❤
Nice!
The DECK is an absolute stunner 😍 Fantastic job . Hope you had a wonderful time with your Mum. Lots of love from Berlin Germany to all of you🥰
Lots of ❤ & big thanks to Simon.
Looks so much better to have troveled the cement, maybe it's just my OCD. It's going to be an other spot where you can enjoy morning coffee, meditation. Great team work, awesome to see friends and family come help you out and enjoy your beautiful oasis. Much love 🤗 🤗
I love the deck. Did you ever think of putting on a roof over the van?
You're one of a kind! The deck build (design, and how fast it was completed) blew me away, and then to learn it was all for your mom at the end was just so sweet. Looking forward to seeing more progress with this build and your house! 😊
Major kudos to you and Simon! So impressed with all the work it took to get that amazing deck. Hope you can enjoy it for many years 💚👏
The Final Countdown ❤ by Europe 🇸🇪 As a Swede I am proud to hear them all the way from Australia 😅 I saw them live at my second concert with them this summer (June 2023) 🌺 Amazing job with the deck 😍👌🏽 It is so perfect, I hope Your beautiful guest will enjoy her stay there ❤ Love to Occy ❤ Looking forward to the next video!
Aw, your such a good son!! I'm so glad you got to have a subscriber help you and it leading to friendship.
Well done Friend. If we were closer I’d be there to help. It is the blessing of community…
Max I luv u buddy but meditating is such a wank when you can feel the love of Jesus …..AA makes you pray to God to get over addiction ..meditation is merely an ancillary 😊…if he helps heroin addicts overcome a ten yr addiction and find joy then it’s good for all
wow, its so beautiful max, and I love the closeness of you and your mum.xxxxxx
Absolutely beautiful...❤
Bravo Simon, awesome generosity. Fantastic idea but beautifully executed. Enjoying the projects, stay healthy and stay well. Looking forward to the full reveal.
“I’ve gone full Backyard Blitz” Holy hell that takes me back!!!! I was on that tv show! Cyclone larry took out my home town & they came to help fix the high school
Wow! Your mother is incredibly beautiful! I'm glad you were able to get the work you wanted done before she arrived. You live in such a remarkable and gorgeous area. It's so lovely and peaceful looking. Truly idyllic. Your friend, Simon, and your neighbors are definitely epic for coming all that way to help you out.
👍🇨🇦🇨🇦
Top job lads! solid effort sticking out the day, bloody legend Simon !! Great to see your enjoying the creativity on the land, Occy looks peaceful too ;)
Great job with the deck Max, big shoutout to Simon for the help.  Might just wanna also put a few boards around the side of the deck to keep anything making a permanent home underneath. :) P.S.  Are you gonna organise a meet 'n' greet with the fans when Jaz and Crystal come down?
Maxxx I loved this video! Please before you get rid off the mullét can you do a long rats tail !!!!!! 😍
Any friend of Vanwives is worth subscribing to.  So I just did 🙂
SO sweet Mum has a great place to stay.  She looks happy
It's bloody FABULOUS!❤😊
Gotta luv doing it  for your mums arrival…..golden times enjoy 👏👏👏❤
Love it!!
Fabulous deck! Can't wait to see the complete build!!!
Hot epson salt bath will do those muscle pain good
I love this! The energy off you is palpable. You’re oozing happiness, creativity and joy. And, I have to say this new Bromance with Simon seems to be a great thing. More of Si on the channel pls. The deck already looks awesome, great effort. And great to see your mum popping over to see you. Sending love you you all, and give Occ a tight squeeze from me.
Occy says, chasing sticks is for kids. He has to much to think over to participate in such trivial pursuits. 😁
You are such an amazing human being. Thank you Simon and Jake for being such a good friends to Max and Occy.  Thank you for sharing this amazing experience with us. If this is how you create a deck, your house is going to be just as beautiful.
What a legend Simon! Chur bro
Awesome video!! I just have to know what mum said about the haircut!
Bless your big heart Simon. You & Max look like you've known each other all your lives. And Big shoutout to Jack too. Jake is too cute but a lil too hyper for big bro Occy 😂 So excited for you and your sweet mum.  Enjoy the visit ❤
What breed is your dog?
I live in a van, but I don't bore you with it.
Great work
Love it, Max!!  ❤
Looks awesome Max 💕 lovely to see your mum  too have a great time together 🥰
Kudos to Simon and your neighbor for help you, and to your mom for providing the impetus for speed!
What a gorgeous build.  Your hard work paid off beautifully.  Well done!
Loved this video!  Having your mom pop in at the end was a delightful surprise!
So cool!! 👽💞✨looking forward to all the creations

Check out Romany pirates, a couple travelling the world in a van. They are fabulous❤
Wow! The deck is amazing! That top level will be perfect for meditation. Great job!
The deck looks great. So much work. Your friend was amazing to help. Hope you have some relaxing time with your mom 😊🐾💗

Such hard work Max. Great help from Simon. Can’t wait to see the next one. 😊
Fantastic  job it all looks incredible  I'm  sure your mum will have a lovely visit and is very proud of all you have achieved  enjoy x
Can we please give a shout out to Jake!❤❤❤
Occy deserves everything! ❤❤❤
Y’all enjoy each other’s company!
a concrete pad, so you can put dollies under the van wheels, means you don't have to park perfectly when you get home from a trip, park close, jack the corners and put the dollies on.
Max, deck looks so good & Occy makes a great supervisor..he never complains..  ;)   God Bless .
💚💛🧡❤️🩷💙💜🩶🤎🤍
You are another wonderful soul put in our path. Subbed, bell is set to ring and off we go
Beautiful!
MAX! YOU ARE THE GREATEST MATE! 😊🎉 Absolutely love your style... Can't wait to see the finished product & Oh my gosh,  your Mum is so beautiful 😍.
Dale dug a hole 😂😂😂😂 I knew what you meant immediately. One of the best Aussie movies made.
You are so handy max great job buddy 👏🫶
Thats a solid deck you've made. Love it. Nice for Occy and your mom.
Your mum is so beautiful!  So glad she could come for a visit. 😊 The deck looks amazing, can’t wait for the upper deck!

Love love your videos….hi from Canada. Been to Australia twice (we have family in around Brisbane) and every time I hear the birds it takes me right back there. And I went to Bunnings also…so cool to reminisce via your videos.
Nice job! Should last a few hundred years😂
I love it. Especially the tidied up concrete footings!
Well done Simon. Thank you much for helping Max.  Great job. Yes you definitely are a legend.  Awesome deck , Max. Occy is going to love it.  Thank you for thinking of him getting good access to it..Looks incredible.  Your Mum is Beautiful.

❤
Simonnnnnnnnnnnn !!!!!!! What a cutie.  Thanks for helping out Man and Occy. Love from Montreal.
Great video …..I keep meaning to say how much Occy reminds me of my 13 yr. old blue Merle Shetland sheep dog.
I knew your Mom was coming!  She's so beautiful!   So much back breaking work on the deck and precision, how wonderful to have the awesome help and from a subscriber!   Cliff hangar now for the next step!
Best mates landscaping ♥️♥️♥️ legend Simon
Simon is a Great Friend!  Love your “van” set-up.  So wonderful that your mom is the first visitor to enjoy the van set-up View! ❤
Don't mind me as I literally cheer alone in my apartment when your mom shows up.  <3 Simon and you did such great work!  And this is wild, but I had a dog that looked so much like Jake growing up...  and his name was Jake!  What are the odds of that?!  Love Occy as always, he's going to be living the dream on his new deck!
Wow ... Simon is an absolute gem!!!  Thank you for ALL your amazing work at Max's spot!  😎
When I watch your videos I can't stop smiling
Boyce I love you from Peru
Love and hugs to Max's mum!!! Having a mum who appreciates your adventures is everything. She seems cool and I'm appreciating that she brought us Max

Great work Simon and Max, the deck looks beautiful. Jake was so much fun and Occy was so funny, lying in the shade letting Jake get on with it lol Have a good week with your mum x
What a gent Simon is and always love to see your lovely mum Jane visiting you too 👏❤️
A great day…..Collingwood won🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉and…….a new deck. What more could you want🤪❤️
I am blown away!!! That deck is amazing.❤🎉😊
You always make me happy. Love from Holland.
Fantastic job on the deck, love the upstairs idea too. Cheers to Simon and your neighbour for helping. You’re a perfectionist like me Max, no such thing as over engineering! If you’re going to do a job, do it properly or not at all. Always love seeing your Mum too, it will be lovely for you to have some time with her in your new paradise home.
Try prayer and reading scripture.  You probably won’t need a shrink. Prayers for u.
Such a special video, Max. Well done to you and your new friend Simon for creating an original deck. Your mum’s arrival had me in tears. This is so special. Two thumbs up.
You are unbelievable in your focus and determination to get things done! Love how you get the help you need in various aspects of your life—so many people don’t, and just muddle through! Love your vids!  ❤️ Keep ‘em comin’ - I don’t have tv! Marion 🇨🇦 Marion
How absolutely lovely it is to have your mum come visit you & your incredible beautiful home❤
Why so many footings?
Simon you LEGEND!! Welcome to your Mum!!
I’ve always been told that I over-engineer my projects but you mate are the King 🤴of Over-Engineering 👑.  I doff my cap and bow down at your dedication to constructing a bombproof, earthquake-proof, typhoon-proof deck! Long may you and Occy enjoy your deck❣️🐾😎
Just outstanding! Can't wait to see it finished... It's always great to have helpful friends... Cheers to Simon!
I still don’t understand why you can’t sleep in your house. The roof is finished (I think) you’ve dried it out for idk how long. Why can’t you sleep and relax inside your home vs your van….?
The 'real life' van interior made me chuckle! Decking looks amazing - 👏👏👏👏 Simon & you.
Get ya hair cut ya bogan!    Lol.
Awesome job everybody and mom is just gorgeous!
Nothing more satisfying than deck building. I love it, and your design is crazy good. And onya Simon ~ Legend
Fabulous project! Enjoy the time with your special visitor!
Every time I watch these videos, I low key wonder how to sneak into this mans life without beeing a creepy stalker. When he said a special woman was coming, and it turns out to be MUM? Stooop it, adorable overload! 💕
Wow Max, how fantastic. Love it.
Downloaded Headspace yesterday,  started today. Although I have been meditating fir years, I can already feel the benefits of this platform. As a certified Gestalt practitioner, I look forward to sharing this with my clients. Thank you 😊
Are you building Occy his guard tower so he can keep an eye on his land? That deck is bloody good mate, looks great and the view off it is lovely
What a great park up deck for when you have van life friends visit in the future. It's awesome. Can't wait to see the meditation deck complete.   Love your beautiful mum. She was part of the inspiration for me to stop dyeing my hair and go natural during lockdown and I am now a very happy silver sister thanks to her. 😊
Are the shirts for sale anywhere? Love you guys!!!
hey Max, are you going to write a book?
Simon is a hero
Love your videos Max!
What an awesome vibe your place is going to have........you deserve it.........Hi Max-i-Mum.......you must be proud of your boy.
So good as always but oh my, the landmower moment was priceless, made me chuckle behind my screen !
You’re so clever Max! That deck looks amazing. This property is going to be amazing. All you van life friends will have to book in 😊
The detail and perfectionism at each step 👌❤
The deck looks sooo good Max...love it ❤
Completely normal to trowell of the top of that concrete. My husband always does it, but he might just be an anal perfectionist.
Good on you Simon .Great to see the Aussie mate-ship nice job on the deck .looking great .love the content.nice place to work
Aww Mummy ❤ the deck looks amazing Max. How nice a bloke is Simon too!!
Simon what an absolute legend. Wow the deck looks awesome mate 🙏I’m sure plenty summer nights will be spend out there ❤

Hi your so lucky you have such good fiends to drop everything and help you..I do hope this new life brings you peace as you seem like such a lovely person a little restless maybe lol I have been like that too and it feel like you are getting the best out of life. All the best for Van life again. Big hugs to Occy 🐾❤️
Awesome video!
I am so glad that Headspace is a sponsor!  A really beneficial app!
Love it! Just out of experience that type of deck material get freaking boiling hot (if its the plastic type)! Watch Occies feet and yours.
Absolutely fantastic!!
Well what an amazing deck Max. How awesome to have people like Simon and good neighbours. Enjoy having your mum with you. Cheers Judy
Thank you Simon, nice meeting you.  Great team work.
I appreciate the need to tidy up your concrete blobs 😂
Loved this video,Max! What an amazing job you and mr badass Simon did building that massive deck with some additional help from your handy and helpful neighbour and it looks boss,mate!! And of course you wanted it to be done before the woman in your life come to visit.The woman who carried you and nursed you into life for nine months and after giving birth to you raise and feed you to the very fine young man that you’ve become. I’m so happy for both of you! An extra big cuddle for Occy,what a legend he is!♥️
Seriously cool, Max! :D
Well done Simon n Max wow looks amazing lots of hard yakka right there! Hope there were a few beers downed you both deserve it 👌👏👏👏
I thought you guys were lifelong friends. Very cool.

Fabulous deck and looks like there are certainly more upgrades to follow and the outside shower will be great. Love that the adorable Occy found his little hideaway in the shade.
And I had tears in my eyes when your mum flew in ❤
Looks truly amazing !!! Well done 🎉
CAN YOU GET A LIGHT WEIGHT TRAILER FOR THE MOWER?  COULD BE A GREAT ASSET FOR GAREN UPKEEP. LOVING OCCY.... IF YOU HAVENT GIVERN OCCY ANY SUPPLEMENTS FOR JOINT HEALTH..... GAVE MY BOYS THE FOLLOWING AND IT REALLY HELPED WITH JOINTS BUT GAVE THEM A ALL ROUND HEALTH BOOST. 'VETS ALL NATURAL.' JOINT FORMULA....... I STARTED THEM STRAIGHT OUT WITH A MAINTAINENCE DOSE.....THEY DIDNT NEED A DOUBLE DOSE, THEY WERE LIKE OCCY......STILL GETTING ABOUT WELL, BUT COULD BE BETTER......❤ TO OCCY
Looks good .just take care with all the bushfires up nth at the moment.
Not sure I should say this..... But, Im going to.... Its goning to be stronger than the house 😮😅🤣 GREAT JOB, GREAT MATE IN SIMON......HE OFFERERED, AND HE FOLLOWED THROUGH....THE GUYS A CHAMPION 👍👏👊
Wow❤❤ amplified beauty and all while making deeper friendships and celebrating your accomplishments with your mom.  Pretty epic!
Love seeing your vision come to life. There is nothing better than chosen family aka friends.  Also love the cap ❤vanwives❤
sorry dude that mowhawk has to go
Awsome❤
Great video great work Welcom  your  mom. 😘😘😘
This is an amazing episode. Wow!
Wow!  Amazing!!!!  looks fabulous!  Loving the view.. fantastic idea Max.
What’s happening with the house? Just had to ask about the elephant in the room …..just love your block and your life plans….🙌
Love all the Aussie-isms in your vids. Simon’s a great bloke for chipping in.
Simon the Super hero well done lads looks fantastic
Yay for having hammock poles
I’m sorry. I can’t watch anymore. You are gifted with this beautiful piece of Paradise and you dig up the beautiful lawn and pour concrete. Argh.
Stunning deck, great to have a good buddy like Simon to give a helping hand. Nothing wrong with having a bit of trowel perfection 😉. Can’t get over how lush and green everything is, just beautiful as we are heading into late fall here in Canada although it was +15C on the Rock. Great content. 😊
Always love mom!!
Another great video well done to you all. Great job on it all.
Smoothing the top of the concrete actually would make a difference to water not getting to your post, so time not wasted! Proper flow of water and sealing of surface to reduce absorption.
you beauty, looking so snazzy hay mum hope to see so much more of you in future vids max i wish i could be there helping you every step of the way looks like so much fun., i guess ill just have to sit back a watch form the southern highlands in nsw.
Love the deck such a great idea looking forward to seeing the next level. Simon such a great bloke to help out like that and of course Occy  loved watching him fill following your every move on the mower 🩵
well done Max
Im at the end of the video now, and am so impressed with the deck build! Occy is going to love sunning there in a safe place! And now i see your dear Mom visiting❤ God bless you both and enjoy your precious time together❤❤
I'm so glad to have you and Occy. What a joy it is to follow you two. ❤
You should be very proud of yourself, so jealous of the life you live, love watching your show.  Keep of living the good life.😊❤
Hi Mom, enjoy it's quite the place your son picked. Say hi to Occy for me please.🌎✌️🙂, Tomic
Do you sell the be kind always mandala decals that you have on your van?
Thank you Simon for helping Max!❤
I'm finding it very satisfying watching you smooth off the concrete footers with a trowel❤
Amazing!  ❤❤
8:43 reminded me totally of inside La Sagrada Familia in Barcelona.  Gorgeous!!!  💚💚💙
JUNGLE DOGGO JUNGLE DOGGO
Just brilliant!  You're a man on a mission alright.

Hello to your mom! You’re amazing Max
Welcome to mom! It's so amazing to find such fantastic people who are willing to be kind and help out. Looks amazing!
Amazing job Max! And quite a bit of help from Simon!
Start taking Magnesium malate and potassium. I take both when I do so much hardwork.
❤❤
❤😎😎😎LOOKING GR8  HI MUM

So lovely your mums there 😢 got a bit teary. Have a wonderful visit😊! The deck is magic 😮❤️🔥
Awesome deck! Loved this episode❤
It's Momma!!! Love it!!❤
Amazing deck!! Love it!!
I’m so distracted by the hair. It’s time for a haircut friend 😂
Over engineering is a good thing. Such a wonderful job. Nothing is wrong with protecting your hard work and investment. Enjoyed your video😊
Love you! Love this build! Well done 👍
Your property is beautiful. Hugs from so Cal
Love your show .
Amazing!!!!!! Simon you’re awesome for helping Max
This is amazing, your hard work has paid off ten fold!!! Enjoy time with your Mom!
Wow, Max, what a job you’ve done on the deck. And, how great is Simon, he’s a star 🌟. The deck with the view over the property is stunning. I love how much energy you’re putting in to make your home comfortable and sustainable. Even though you’re tired, how fit are you now with all this physical activity. ❤
So happy he showed the reality of his van during a major project! So difficult to maintain much balance when trying to get a lot done in a short amount of time like this. Great video and congrats on making some more space for yourself!
Max, it looks amazing. Now I’m thinking ur gonna add a ladder and go up on that deck ur building . I love ur making easy for occy too. Hope we don’t have to wait long for next vid , ur place looks amazing!.
Oh so good ya Mum there with you!
Incredible design, Max and so precise!! What a great mate is Simon?! Thank you for your skills and time in helping out, and teaching me how to set up deck foundations and framing. Looks very spick, Max. Occy obviously approves. Lovely to meet ya mum, too!
Too funny. I just finished a deck build with my brother and we were one board short too.
I knew it was going to be your Mum! Yay!.. She's so gorgeous, have a great time with her! :) Simon you're a legend for helping out Max and that deck is beautiful Max, great for all but especially Oc xx
Does Simon have a channel? We'd love to see what it is and get a tour! 😊✌️
Jake is a stunning blue!!!
Max you need a variable nd filter that'll take care of those whites blowing out on your camera.
Over kill  .  but looks great
I need a Simon!!!
How wonderful of Simon to travel all that way to help you with the deck, which by the way, is gorgeous!! Have a great visit with your mom. ❤❤
Just awesome - Simon is a legend - such great people - Much love all.
Just watched VanWives where they mentioned Max having one of the first The Pack hats - love to see it in this video. ❤
love the deck! and so nice to see your mom. hope you all had a nice visit ❤
Super Awesome deck, looks amazing.  Nicely done!
Simon is a legend, he’s obviously very skilled, I like that you over engineered the deck it’s going to feel awesome under foot. Nice touch with corrugated iron under your shower - love that idea!!!   I’m putting my vet nurse cap on, just mention to Simon that if Jake is happy with ball that’s preferable to a stick. I’ve seen some terrible injuries to the palate that happen when the dog snatches the stick from the ground and the end jams into their mouth. Totally up to him but thought I’d mention it xoxoxoxo
She’s so cute!!  Enjoy your time with your Mimi hope she convinces you to get a haircut. 😂
You're vides are easily my faves. I'm an Aussie too so I love watcbhing a wonderful,creative bloke qho loves his dog so much. Can't wait for the next one!! Thankyou 😊🦘🦘🦘
Lol...I rent machinery the same way. Before a weekend so I get it 3 days for the price of 1.
What an awesome deck...Simon is a great mate to have round when you are itching to do an upgrade🙌❤🙌💚🌈 Welcome Mum to Max's corner of paradise!!😍😍😍 Have a great visit💛 See ya next time👋👋👋👋
Your behind-the-scenes view at 17:12 just made you human and even more relatable! 😄

Welcome to mom!!))))
You have so much work to do, I'm sure it is going to turn out awesome.
this is going to be amazing
Do you ever feel nervous or scared living so isolated from people?
Hi Mom!😘
♥️..thank you Simon😊💕🇺🇸
Wow, you guys rocked the deck!!  It's absolutely gorgeous!!  All the improvements your doing to the property are amazing!!
Love watching your videos. Looks great! Just watch when the deck gets wet, it's slick. Used it on a wharf here in BC Canada. Not happy with it. Hopefully your product is better.
A shot of whiskey and a massage will do, thank you.
I enjoyed this build the most compared to all your others, don’t know why specifically. It is a beautiful deck for sure. Well done guys. Can’t wait to see the finished product.
Awesome vid. Awesome decking. Cant wait to see it finished with the shower.. You have such out there ideas and they always seem to work! With Occy's help of course (and a little bit from Simon 😂).  I was just up that way from Melbourne and camped at Corindi Beach. Northern NSW is such a beautiful area. Keep those updates coming 😊
Thanks Simon!  Good job!
Simon 👍. And WOW. The deck is amazing.  Max you are amazing.
My bud started a decking business and as a fellow kiwi asked me what I thought of his name..I suggested decking around 😂 with the kiwi accent I thought that would sound hallariou..final name he decided on..decks n all 😂
Love you ❤
Yay Simon!  Awesome deck guys!
You are amazing. Congratulations for being you…..👏💕
Amazing xx work by you guys and great seeing your mum hurry up and finish xx❤
Your mum hasn’t aged, the deck is looking fantastic so far. Great to see you’re happy and in a better space Max, 👍.
Well done Mate

Lovely to see your mum spending some time with you ❤
Yay Simon! Fantastic video ❤
Simon is an incredible friend.
What a wonderful video 😍
We love mum … welcome mum!
Simon is a rock star! What an amazing gift he gave to come hang & work with you for a w/e. That had to be an amazing mental health boost in itself!  That deck is amazing! Can’t wait to see it completed! So thrilled your mom made it up for a visit!
That's awesome! well done  & thanks Simon & neighbour for helping Max & Occy. 🥰
Straight to the pool room with this weeks vid. 🎉
I am good on the tea and coffee but I could use a back message 😂
The more deck the better they say, I want one that wraps all the way around my house....but you know. wishes in one hand - dreams in the other.
Hi to your mom. Ma’am, you raised a terrific human.
You are BLOODY AMAZING 🎉🎉🎉
What a beautiful project! I am loving seeing all the work you’re doing on your forever home ❤
You wear that hair like a rockstar.... you should keep it.
LOVE the deck! Thank you for allowing us to be with you on this journey. Any update on merch?
❤🙌🐾
Ive got the covid and just said to myself "wouldn't it be nice if there was a new Occy vid to cheer us up?" and BINGO there was!  Great to have you back.  Now to watch!!
Looking great. And yes, I found that satisfying when you troweled off the concrete. 😃
GDay Mum, Welcome to Casa Maxxy.   Max, The deck is awesome!!! You're putting a 2nd deck on the deck? Making a guest condo already? The view from the deck is AAAAAmazing!!!! Couldn't have been a better place for the deck.  THANK YOU SIMON, You Rocked!!!  Occy looks like he's missing the beach.  It's great to see you so happy Max. You not only found your place, you also found yourself again. And that's such a long time coming. I'm very happy for you and very proud of you. You're a long way from 3 years ago.  Love to you and Occy, Matt - Toronto, Canada
Oh my husband would always smooth a concrete pour, no matter where it was located. He wanted all his projects to be as neat as possible. This is going to be such a great deck.
Big deck (in kiwi accent)
Wow! Your vision and construction work is so good! Thank you Simon for giving a helping hand. Enjoy your visit with your mom! Wish I had some skills to offer to give you a hand sir!
Simon is fine as hell 🎉
Awesome work guys, you’ve given me so inspiration and motivation for my own place😊 Maybe a different idea for shower base, snakes will love it under the corro. 🐍
Hey mate love you're videos there awesome! Would love to see more of em!!
Outstanding  And as a muma of boys I feel your mums excitement ❤
Keep looking at your green space, you defo hit the jackpot, what an oasis! My meditation would be a silent walk through your garden
Cheers to Simon & all your neighbors & friends that support you. Have a great visit with your mom
Your thought process to conceptualise and then build this extra living space to your van is brilliant! Huge kudos to Simon and your neighbour for the extra effort they supplied to get the deck ready for your mum’s visit 🙌🏼👍🏼
What a wonderful journey.  The deck is next level & I can’t wait to see what you do next.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love the deck! The composite boards are beautiful. I can't wait to see it finished and lived on!❤ I wish they were in my budget the porch I have to have rebuilt for the 2nd time!
Thanks Simon and Jake...👍 Love your place Max.
Hey Max ..lol it's all fruit I here you say fruits..maybe the language has changed but you say lots of fruit lol I don't think there is plural fruits..fruit, fruiting etc but no plural fruit..lo, hope that's right you said it in another video.. just sounded odd lol...anyway love all you do n share..lol thers no such word as "n" eitherlol
Congrats to Max and Simon on the deck prohect.  Occy and Jake, snuggles for you, can you feel them, yet?  ❤❤❤❤  Awesome, Max.  Hello to Mum.
You have such amazing friends🎉
Welcome to your mom and great job on the deck!  The upper level is going to be a game changer.
Love U Max & Occy .Thanks for sharing this journey with me.  Mucho Love from your Friend in Michigan Tam.  Nice Deck great job guys.❤❤
What a legend Simon 😎 Thanks foe helping Max & Occy looking awesome
What wonderful friends you have in Simon and Jack. Your deck is beautiful.
Why would you make it a permanent deck? You bought a cabin to live in. The time you take bldg a deck for the van you could finish several rooms in the cabin. I dont get it.
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Good job looks great x
Deck looks great! your property is beautiful ♥️ enjoy your time with mum 😊
Looking good ... always lovely to see your mum ... we forage those native raspberries along our km long driveway, they are always a bit tart but great to throw into your breakfast bowl.
Not only the smoothing of the concrete but the whole deck build is extremely satisfying. Do it right and its built for life ❤
Good onya Simon! Well done Max! Surprised you didn’t sign your names in the concrete?❤️✨
Huge kudos to Simon.  I checked your website but don't see anywhere that your merch can be purchased. I'm assuming?? it's not yet available for sale.
I love this!!!❤
Great job on the deck, Could I hire you to do our deck? 😂 here in Southern California
How fabulous looking awesome Max and how wonderful to have your mum come and see your beautiful views from your brand new deck ❤
Simon is a gem💎. Thank you helping Max and Occy❤🎉 . Next time you up this way I have a garden too also need TLC😊 just incase you need the excercise. Max this turned out a paradise. Your Mum would enjoy it I am sure. She is lovely lady. Hope you had fun too. Of course last but not least Occy I am in love with you💓💓💓💗💗💗😢
Wow, it looks amazing. You and Simon worked so well together. Love that you go the extra bit. Great neighbours come in handy also. Great to see your mum. Enjoy your time together. xox 😊
Shout out to Simon and Jake!  Great having friends to help with projects around the property.  You mom looks so happy and proud of you!
The things we do for love. Your mum will enjoy that I know what I would.
I got really emotional when your mom got out of the truck! So awesome that you have her to share everything with!
Another great video! I love seeing the progress on your home and grounds!
Max there is no doubt that the concrete will hold soooo much better since you leveled the top 🤠❤️
This was so satisfying to watch your deck come together!! Love the over the top attention to detail- credit to you! Simon- what a legend for all his help. Enjoy the time with your mum :)
Great job and yes Simon is a legend … your mum looked so proud well done all 👌👌
Seems cheaper to put up a modular home that you can modify
Max your decking is beautiful. Max iam a new subsciber when is your new merch is out.  Xx
Hurrah! Your Mom is there! Enjoy every minute of having her there with you, so special.
Deck looks awesome!! Is it possible to buy the merch?
I love the deck!  It gives me ideas for the deck that I want to build in a few months!  I appreciate the ideas!
Well done you. 🎉❤🎉
Yes, tea & back massage, thank you. 😊
Simon your a legend and your dog is gorgeous! 💕
That my looks amazing poor you the back must be killing lot of blood 🩸 sweat and tears went into this project so far Simon was amazing but so are you the dream is becoming a reality and you deserve it. Your mom is precious every son should love and cherish his mother like you do till the next video Jacky, the old lady from Montreal.
👌💜👍💜
Looking really good 😊
<3
Simon looks like a boy scout in that shirt! 😂
Your deck is just gorgeous Max! Also, I don't know how you can bear to cut out all that wonderful greenery when you close your eyes to meditate. It is all just beautiful 🤩
Now when your friends come they too can park there and enjoy the deck.❤
I’m a gutted for you for all the issues you’ve had with the new house. Just wondering if you’ve thought about just bulldozing it and putting up a new tiny home or cabin? Pouring money into the old home may end up just as expensive as starting from scratch… Then again, you’ve taken it back practically to the bones/framing now so I guess it is pretty much going to be like a new build.
Im sorry u going through all this with the home
What a wonderful project.. with very good ppl to lend a hand. Dude, your Mum is beautiful!
Great job Aw So Special for your Mama ❤
from a builder - well done mate awesome job!
That's wonderful you get to spend time together with your mom.
Wow what an awesome deck!  And many thanks to Simon!  So nice to see you with Mom at the end!  Your days together will be the best❤
All of the work that has gone into the deck so far look's amazing & will last you for yonks!!  I'm particularly looking forward to seeing the steps going into your Yoga / Medication space in coming vlogs, though please give consideration into putting up Hand & Mid rails around this space, as your Older-Self will thankyou in the decades to come at your forever home!!!
Simon” your the man 💕👍🏽
Wow incredible ❤
Thank you to Simon and to neighbor for all the help. There is nothing as special as a friend. Great to see you mum, enjoy the time. Thank you Max and so happy to see your progress and your joy.
Looks amazing x great job
So lovely to see Jane on the vid again. That’s one awesome deck.
Just awesome
Wow.    Looks amazing 🎉
While watching all of your current videos, I've gone back to the start and started watching the Max and Lee stuff and oh, my, goodness - how little was Occy back then!? Well I know he wasn't exactly a pup but still. Looking forward to seeing whatever you're doing extra with the deck. Just out of curiosity, were you very quietly referencing that NZ "deck" fake commercial by any chance? lol.
Max, your mom is as beautiful as your heart is.  I hope you enjoy your time together.
LOVE the deck! What a top bloke Simon is! Great attention to detail Max and all your projects look awesome  👏
You  and Simon did a great job
Thank you Simon for helping with this gorgeous deck! Was fun to see the doggies. Occy is going to have a great time on this deck. Enjoy your time with your mom!
Big weekend lots done good job
Bloody amazing!!! Simon what a guy, what a team ❤
Simon, big thanks for lending your expertise to Max and his special projects. Can't wait for your next visit!
BONJOUR,from Montréal  Québec.Just love your videos .Your content and editing is just so professionnal .You show your vulnerability with such human kindness,you are a genuinely a kind person.I wish you well in all your projects .Be safe.
Glad to see I'm not the only one who cleans up the post hole concrete! Lol!
You are so blessed to have such an amazing friend and I think your mum was very impressed. Can’t wait to see it all finished .
Love the deck and love how Simon’s energy matches yours.
WOW....
Beautiful deck! You may never want to move into the cabin! Special shout out to Simon! And it was awesome to see your mom! ❤❤❤
Great job guys.
Noooice
The best videos are those that leave you smiling! Thanks, Max.
Being a girl I never thought I would enjoy so much watching the deck come together. Top notch ! Absolutely beautiful.
Happy Sunday Love your adventures either build your dream house or road trip Good job Simon 👏👏👏
A wonderful achievement,  Max. Your mum will love staying there.🥰
Helpful hint about painting. Apply lotion heavily before painting and it will wash off easier.
Looks great and what a way to extend your living quarters.
😊😊😊
Hey Occy can u steer me to the Headspace meditation offer.
You did a fantastic job 🎉🎉🎉
🥰
You are caretaking a most beautiful piece of bush. ❤️
I don't know why your videos always fill my heart with joy and deep emotional moments. Always very inspiring and moving. So happy to see you with your mom, and the priceless smile she had when she saw you and that glorious view. Thanks for sharing!
Simon thank you for helping Max. It will be awesome . Glad to see your lovely mom. Enjoy your time together. Love the deck around the van.
“Everything for Occy.” Love it! 🫶🐾
Deck looks amazing, will be so good while you build out your cabin, turn that mullet into dredies,
That shirt is not going to be white for long
💜💕🧡💕❤️
Wow! Handsome man, who loves his mother and a cute dog!!😊
🥰🥰🥰That cattle dog!!🥰🥰🥰
Looks great and well done Simon for helping out 👏 👏 👏   Max, have you looked into a steel frame kit home to replace the cabin? The housing crisis has pumped out some great new designs in Australia, even spacey 2 bedroom granny flat designs.
Why didn't you line your roof with a water proof membrane before sheeting it?
There is soooo much love and light emanating from you in this video! Feels like such a gift to share this with you <3  You're able to achieve so much with help from your community, but also on your own, and my heart explodes that you met your goal in time for your mom's visit! So grateful to be (virtually) here with you Max!
Is that how many post holes are required for a 2 ft high deck in AUS? Seems like a lot.
Awesome to see that even though you will be having the house you made a spot for the van to be part of the home and be used as well. Love it mate can't wait to see more
In my few years of doing landscaping and irrigation technician work. Iv never had a good experience with anything made by toro x.x Edit: Maybe look into adding a Rain Garden or 2 to certain area's of the lot to both direct water away from buildings and allow that excess water to be of use. Edit 2: Love the videos! Love the feature length episodes of your life as well! Your videos always bring me a bit of downtime/peace as well as some motivation!
Max, that is bloody genius!!!   Big love to Simon for his graft! Loving the over engineering! 😂
You can be bloody proud of all your building talent Max ❣️ It looks amazing your amazing to watch and your Mom is beautiful. Blessings from Hawaii 🌺😎🌴
👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻
This is so exciting, absolutely beautiful deck.., brilliant design. Can't wait to see the next stage!
Wow,I love your video. Your deck is amazing. I can't wait to see what else you have in mind. I wish your video was longer, I enjoyed it so much.
I'm jealous of your glorious fig. 🥰
You are a very cool guy , love ya Brother and keep up the good work !
Hi Mom!!
Simon 😅😊
⭐⭐⭐⭐ It's always great when I get to see you & Occy. Furthermore, Max your personality and way of dealing with people, is to be commended.  I hope your mom's stay is a lovely one... Abrazos
You and your Mum.  💖
Yay...i wait each week for your video. you made my day Max and Occy. xxxx
Max! This is amazing. So well thought out. And I miss Simon already - glad you do too. He is a gem. Hope you two stay close and visit often. Excited for your continued progress.
thets realy ceatif, a raly nice idee. even for the long turm. see you next time
Oh Max wow, bloody wow and then when I saw your mum at the airport and her reaction to your beautiful deck that was pretty much done for her it just made me cry.  I don’t  have my mum anymore but I’d love to have my mum come to our lovely new home, to see your mums reaction was just fantastic.  You’re so lucky you have such a great and loving family, I only have my brother now, it really makes me happy to see such love.  Know you pretty much have it all lovely man.  Be happy.  Love to Occy too.  💕
Your mom's beautiful ❤
Beautiful! Enjoy this time with your gorgeous mum.
AMEI. !!!!!! AMEI !!!!! AMEI AS IMAGENS, AMEI O DECK, AMEI O SIMON, AMEI QUE SUA MÃE CHEGOU PARA TE FAZER COMPANHIA, ELA É LINDA. !!!! PARABÉNS.  JÁ ESTOU COM SAUDADE. 💛💚💚💚💛
Agree the concrete looks much better tidied up! Same really with a haircut, it's only going to be hotter in the coming months so it would be healthier to cut off that wretched, er, I mean,  extra hair. ::Giggle:: (I couldn't resist but honestly I like long hair. A ponytail or a bun would be cooler.)
This deck is AMAZING !!! Well done in creating this beautiful spot for your Van - the van deserves this great home!
Love it ❤ Im sure your mum did also! Enjoy that view!
You sure don’t do anything half assed! Your mom must be so proud of you.  What an awesome place for her to visit you, and wake up to having her coffee on that deck with that view and peace.  ❤
Great design idea. It come up a treat! 👍🍻🎯😊
You should be so proud of yourself Max. You have done an amazing job and proved that with a little help from your friends, nothing is impossible. So encouraging and so endearing to see you in your element and so happy as you deserve to be. Wow what a deck! Occy is a fabulous overseer making sure his apprentice Jake stays busy. Love the videos. They are definitely motivating. Can't wait to see what you and Simon do next time he comes up.  Cheers.
Wow looks amazing.  You are very talented.  Enjoy time with your mum. ❤

Simon rocks! Max that is gonna be so lit! Congrats on the progress. Can't wait to see the "next level"!
Great deck! 🎉👍
Very cool!
Thank you so much, Simon for helping Max and Occy.  The deck looks fabulous.  Welcome to Max’s mom. I’m sure you’ll both bring busy.
Man, what a deck head!
Love the content, look forward to what’s next! Thanks for the Huge grin!  Electric power mowers and nail guns. Words cannot encapsulate the experience. ❤🤓
Max I’m with you 100% on making those concrete blobs look neat. ❤
Nice work you guys; always more fun to share the work with more hands :)
Wow you and Simon are a team! The deck is superb! Can't wait until you finish the upper surptise!  Hi Mom 🎉🎉🎉
That looks amazing Max!! Great job!!
Shout out to Simon for lending a hand!  Awesome to see your lovely mom.  Looks like it will be a great deck!  Give Occy a belly rub for us!!
Love it!  Your deck looks so nice!!!!  Hey, I think Eamon and Bec really like your Australian accent because on their post today, they (especially Eamon) are talking just like YOU!  hahahaha. (PS: I love your mom’s hair!)
BEST MATE’S LANDSCAPING! 🎉 Simon is a Legend! 💗💞💐👏
It’s a big day, lot of work but your investing in your future , take care 🌸
Max I'm so with you on trowelling off the pads, the kind of thing I'd do, and over engineering is always a good thing! Do it once do it right and you'll reap the rewards of you hard work for far longer 🙂😎🤓 Great work guys and a MASSIVE shout out to the Legend that is Simon, great work Sir, you are a true gentleman! Much ❤ to everyone involved!
That came out great and so glad Simon and Jack could help. And hello to your beautiful mom !!!  Occy seems to approve all of it and that is what matters 😊
Well done, to you both and to Simon for such generous help. Good people around 😊🌸
Lucky you to have Simon and all other friends helping on your projects.  I know it’s exhausting but also deeply satisfying to create your own spaces. And good grief, any project supervised by dogs, well what more can you ask for!
❤❤❤
Awesome deck Max, I am sure your mum will enjoy it and we, her!!! Kudos to Simon.
fabulous deck🤎🍂
What an amazing view and lifestyle. To be at one with nature is great although sometimes I expect it can get scary. You really are a unique character lol. Take care 🤗
If you really want to impress her lose the mullet. 😉
Simon👍thank you your expertise in helping Max😊
That’s incredible!!
Looking great Max!!! I can't wait to see the finishing touches 😍 Hi to your Mom, have a great visit❣
So well done on this lovely decking and idea🎉. Your neighbour/friend was very kind and helpful to you on this project. Thanks to him for saving you so much time and effort.  How lovely for your Mum to come and stay. Enjoy your time with her, it will be special.  You were like a boy with a new toy, bless you!!!  Take care and look forward to seeing your next video.🏡🙏🙋🇬🇧
Simon's a rock star for helping you out so much.  Hope you enjoy your visit with your mom.
Max watching this video😊you, Eamon & Bec, Trent &Allie have 🐾mascots🐶🐺🐶🐾 supervising the job's👍
Yes , thank you for spelling out the word you meant 😂😂lol
Great job Simon, thank you for helping Max & Occy build their dreams into fruition.  Welcome to the project mum 😊
Wait so what’s going on with the house?
Great video! ❤️🇨🇦
You need sweat bands or folded bandanas tied around your head they work awesome and keep sweat from your eyes
Great work, awesome deck. Great Mom. Hug her every day. Nice video. I'm a new sub over from Vanwives. Cheers!
❤ the deck, ❤ the video,  ❤ you and Occy and big ❤ to Simon.
You definitely need a to make a board to take pics of all your visitors and post them on a welcome wall…get yourself a Polaroid 😊
Peerrrfffeeection❤❤
Alright Simon! Lending your expertise to the decks is sooooo helpful! You're the man!
I’m with you Max, I do not like painting! Everyone always says that it’s easy and inexpensive. I say it’s time consuming and tedious! You’ve come a long way on your deck and it looks amazing! Love the longer videos! I could watch you and Occy for hours! Simon is a champion friend! Hope you and your mom have a wonderful visit!
Absolutely have to pretty the concrete!!! 😂😂
Love you all
I would just put gravel under your deck that way the water will not get mud under the deck
Simon is the Best!
God love you!!!lLook to god for peace of mind.❤🙏🏼🤴🏻🐕😊
Beautiful deck. Too job
Max what a job! Great help from your new friend and neighbours. That view is everything, coffee and meditations are gonna be epic 👏❤
Everything for Occy!!!! 🐶
You might want to look in to joint meds for your boy? You can tell he is having a harder time getting up! Even might go to Rymadyl for old bones and pain?
Go Simon! Good work Max. Occy knows how to relax, no matter the workload!
Thank you Simon! You are a good friend! ❤️🇨🇦
Simon thanks
Very satisfying great idea😂❤
You have a little bit of paradise and are just making it better! If I had a van and lived in Australia! Great work Simon and your neighbour. Take care x
All I can say is good job. Hopefully you can rebuild your house too. If all is termite infested. Why not. Not meaning it as a mean comment. Just would be better to do that. Say hi to oggie. 😊🎃
😘😘😘😘
Tea and a back message would be great, thanks!  😊
Well done, great team work😊
Trowling the cement is good idea, especially with the rain you get😂
The bromance! 🥰❤
.......    meh
You definitely did go above and beyond, but hot damn it will be worth it!! Can't believe how excited I am to see the finished result of this little deck!
I'll take the massage😂
This was so amazing.  So excited to watch your journey.  Your mom is so lovely!
Max you are a hardworking sweetheart.  I love that you were rushing to make things special for your mom.  Simon is a legend. You make a great duo.
Wow! That looks so cool, Max. Awesome job!  And of course, everything is for Occy! LOL Speaking of... give him an extra cuddle and keep one for yourself. 💜
It turned out beautiful. Enjoy your stay mom.❤❤
The deck area was such a good idea! It's looking amazing - I'm really loving the homestead vids! hugs to Occy!
That Simon, what a guy!   Can't wait to see the finished project, Max.  Your mom is so beautiful - and she looks so proud and happy for you!  This is sooo cool!
Great Video.  ❤
Absolutely beautiful
Your mother is beautiful 😍 That deck looks amazing! Glad you have friends to help along the way 🥰
Love your projects. No wonder why you have help around every corner. You take care of everyone. Wonderful to see.
It’s beautiful Max! I’d fly all the way to Australia just to stay right there! Enjoy the fruits of your labor!
Brilliant work mate

💗Awe,I'm so happy for you, your beautiful Mama came to visit you & see your beautiful home! 💗I love your new deck its fantastic! 💗Have a wonderful time,much love from 🇨🇦 take care,bye for now💗
Simon you are a hero friend. Great job in helping our Max out. I'd have poured the beer at night and the coffee in the morning if I lived within 2000 miles. lol  Would cleaning/pet care/cooking and helping where ever I could help? Just be safe and hug Occy and Jake for me!! Gosh I adore you guys. Wishing you a wonderful and safe week! PS....That'll teach me for commenting before end of the video.....waves at your Mom!
It has turned out AMAZING!!! Can’t wait to see the rest.
It looks great so far!!
A beautiful deck!!!  So glad that Simon was able to help and now you have mum!!
❤
Loving that deck
AMAZING, Max!!!!
It looks like stairs are in the future of the deck. Along with an upper level. Looks fantastic.
your mum is beautiful
Simon❤❤❤
Bravo Simon your awesome 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻.  Thanks for helping Max👍🏻
Omg!!! I love it so much it’s perfect!! And the fur buddy loves it so much I bet ❤🎉 great job!!!
O.m.g. how pure is Max ❤ much love to the family get together love you too Occy ❤
Could you pleaseput a warning before showing snakes and spiders? I think it would be helpful, thanks!
Very well done. Looks great!   Can’t wait to see what’s coming next.
Thank you Simon for being such a great friend!!!!!
I noticed that you took all of your efforts to get the deck supported up off the ground but left some wood supports nailed on the bends of the deck in direct contact with the ground. These need to be removed or termites will climb up them and then invade the entire structure.
Hi Max's mom!!❤❤
Simon is incredible - love how you over engineered the deck Max - never heard of metal deck struts but with termites in Oz, it makes sense.  Glad you preserved the wood too!  Great design, as always.
You have such amazing friends & you give as much as you receive!!
Max.... It turned out AMAZEBALLS!!! All your over engineering really paid off! BIG TIME!!! I can't wait to see the balcony!!!
You’re making a bedroom on that deck aren’t you?
Wow!! -  You and Simon did such a great job and how lovely that your mom gets to enjoy it first!
What a fantastic deck! Looking forward to seeing the rest of what you have planned😂. Enjoy your time with your Mom ❤❤
Superb!`
woop woop thanks Simon!!! Wow Max you're a power house!! Occy is a great stupervisor!! What an incredible project. thanks for all the great videos. I always look forward to them!!❤❤
You're so precious and what a lovely Mom! Simon rocks! This was well worth the wait.
Haha I am subscribed to this channel just to hear Max’s accent . .. and now for this vid, Simon’s too 😅
Love your content…and your t-shirt!   Where can we purchase it??   I’m in the USA
God before you know it, the eco system is fucked up and it will look like a hillbilly farm..
Simon is such a blessing to getting your deck build going. What a good person! Absolutely loving the deck and the view. Beautiful! So happy to see Occy supervising from his very cozy jungle bed. 🤣 Have an amazing visit with your mum and enjoy every moment!
19:13 👍👍👍👍👍💜🤩 Simon!
Such a beautiful deck !
Hi Max & Occy 👋🏼 Just started the video but wanted to pop in quick n throw out a lil idea....for the deck n Occy you could make him a lil ramp off to one side. I'd use grip tape on the wood as well so it's not slippery when wet. So even the low side for him to jump up in time may become a bit much so having a lil ramp may help him n also if u ever need to get something up using a wheelbarrow for example ur already ready ☺️ just an idea!  🐾💙 WOW Max, just W😍W!!! This is fantastic, it's a dream really!! You have a brilliant mind and vision n I am def here for it! Vanlife goals for sure!! So excited for the finished results altho I am thoroughly enjoying the journey!! 🩵 So happy you had Simon & Mom to help/enjoy w you & Oc!!! Sending all the love, joy & peace ✌🏼💚🐾✨🙏🏼
Love watching your videos and of course Occy🧡. Amazing work and thank you for sharing your journey🤙
I love the smell of fresh concrete in the morning! Awesome deck - great job by everyone!
Hi Mum
Just when I think I can't love you and Occy anymore....You both steel my heart with the love you have for each other, and then what a good son you are to you glamorous mum!! Have a great time and it all looks fantastic!! 🤪💜🐶💜
can Simon come to new jersey? LOL
Well done!  The deck is awesome.  You're lucky to have such a great mate in Simon and your neighbor to help out.  And, of course, your Mum.
Amazing deck. Can't wait to see the next phase 😊
Enjoy your mum! God bless
Awesome video max🎉 you and Simon did a stellar job and can't wait to see you enjoy your new deck 🎉 take care Pete cape town south Africa looking forward to seeing you soon
Back massage? Dont threaten me with a good time. 😂😂😂
I don't know if your well water is hard or soft water but having a rainwater shower would be wonderful. Do you collect your rainwater?
This grandma in Canada has become a recent subscriber, and I'm now fully engaged in your content.  Several comments to make off the top... Living in extreme climates can be challenging.  Congratulations on finding your way to solutions that work for you.  Either that deck photographs extremely well, or your childhood building experience has really paid off!  Simon is a jewel.  Hardworking, talented, and a bit of eye candy to boot.  Thumbs up from the other end of the world.  Also, your mom is a treasure.  Hope she really enjoys her stay.  You've certainly outdone yourself to welcome her to your new home.  Finally, thank you Max, for recommending BetterHelp in past videos.  I made an appointment, and just the intention started to move things in a better direction.  We live in a magnificent universe.  Wishing you all the love and bounty it has to offer. 💖🍁💖
Awesome deck Max! I’m sure your mom will feel right at home on the property and you will have an amazing visit. Simon is a great friend to have and you two work so well together.😊❤
i love that you chose to meditate with the tree ❤
Why so many holes?! That seems like way overkill and we have to deal with frost. Why not do a beam and save all those holes and concrete?  Okay scratch that comment…further into the build I understand…you’re beefing it up enough you can park your van in the deck😂
PERFECT!!!! And Occy likes it!
Wish I had a mate like Simon!
Love Love LOVE the deck Van life extension deck. I can’t wait to see the rest. Enjoy your time with Mom 👍💕✌️
The idea of a roof deck is great. Do you have fragrant tropical flowers on the property? Some gardenia (my fav and they are evergreen too), Jasmine or something similar around the deck would be lovely. And some orchids around the shower (with proper drainage). Maybe in some rustic very open weave baskets mounted high or low). Could be very spa like.
13:38 You can give me a massage.  Had a fall two days ago while getting all the yard work done before the SNOW starts to fall  here in Alberta, and my whole back from below my hips all the way up to base of my neck, is so sore.  To  make things worse  I am not a 'spring chicken' anymore.  Simon is a gods send.  So happy that you made a new friend who drove 7 hrs. down to help you.  We can't get people to help us because they have to drive 1-2 hrs. out of Calgary to get to our place in the country.  btw  what was the temp. when you were building?
Hi Mum. She’s so Beautiful !!    You’re a Wonderful Son Max 😍
SPECTACULAR !!!!
Everything for Occy! 🤗🐾 and there is always time to throw a stick for your best mate! 👍🏻🐾
It looks absolutely amazing.
Thanks to Simon for helping you.  Great job you two.
It’s so so wonderful to see you enjoying life !,😅😊
The compost decks are amazing and easy to care for.  Great choice Guys
22:20  The concrete makes such an awesome sound here. ☺ You and Simon have done an incredible job and I'm so impressed at your "over-engineering". It's a great idea! Occy is the most beautiful boy. You couldn't ask for a better companion. Welcome Max's Mum. ♥
So special, awesome that you have amazing people in your life to enjoy and help!  Well done!!🩵
I love your vlogs but are aware head space was fined for giving peoples information out.I suffer mental health an this company doesn't sound good
thanks so much, simon. hey mum! max and occy, stars as usual.
All for Mom. I love that!! ❤🫂 Hope she enjoys those amazing views. Probably the most beautiful property I've ever seen. Enjoy your stay.
The deck looks great
Thank you Simon. What a great guy. Take care of that collector (1st run) t-shirt.
Enjoy family time
Always enjoy my Sunday morning coffee, relaxing while watching your amazing adventures!  Nice work guys!  Anything for Occy.
Love the deck. Good Luck on fixing up your dream home. I see a vision for you. I can't wait to see it completed. As I'm sure, your more excited than I. Now, where do I order a shirt? Or shirts?????😂  Does the pup have his own? I'm asking for a four legged friend, Zana wants his merch, 😂. I think she has a doggie crush all the way from Tennessee 🐾🐾💗🐾🐾💙
When is the house going to be ok to build. I must have missed that vlog explaining when. Fantastic job on the deck, and you do seem really happy. 👍 oh yes you look like your mom. 😊
📐📐🔨🔨🔨🔨🍻🍻🍻📹📹👍👍
Great job, guys!! Absolutely amazing deck.
The power of two, can't wait to see the rest. 👍👍
Outstanding job well done!  The Vanwives would be proud of you!  Excellent design and perfect execution!  Nice to see your Mom visiting!
✌️🙏👍
Max wow what a project nice job 👍
Wow max well done bloody awesome ❤❤❤❤
AMAZING JOB ! I’m glad to see I’m not the only one who would smooth out the concrete blobs. 😂 So happy for you and occy. You mom is so beautiful
Simon! A new friend for life!
Cheers to Simon for being such a great friend and builder. Very entertaining to watch, Max. Scritches to Occy! Can't wait for the next one.
Thanks for distraction away from world events  it put  a smile on my face if only briefly.
What an amazing deck!  You and Simon did a bang-up job!  And so happy your Mum is there for a visit.
Amazing vision & ability to execute! Great job! You bring me so much joy watching your videos! And Occy, such a boss dog!
Well done Max, deck looks amazing, can’t wait to see it finished ✌🏼💚💡
AWESOME! Wonderful friends! Good on you Jake and Simon! building dreams! You mum is a light!
Great job, Simon and Max! It’s a beautiful deck!
❤❤❤
Good on ya Simon🎉
Thanks Simon for helping our friend. ❤
Wow that looks amazing :) Good Job!
The deck looks great - well played to both you a Simon! And Max...... Your mullet is pretty awful.  But I've just watched eamon&bec's offering for today.  And now, compared to the 'bowl cut' that Eamon is sporting, your mullet looks positively only mildly offensive!
How funny I immediately thought "it's your Mum"! It was the special glint in your eyes that gave it away! Shout out and love to you Simon and Jake, Jake you gotta be quick to get one over Occy, specially on his home turf mate. Love It!
Love ya Simon!
A Big Hello to Mum and Simon of cause xxx nice to see your Mum xxxxx
My eyeballs started sweating a bit there at the end of the vid.  We now know where Max's killer smile comes from!
Your mum is beautiful!!!  It's lovely that you still like spending time with her!!  Things are looking great.
Simon is a rockstar too!  I love that you two have connected.  You know Max, I believe all of your viewers would be just like Simon and we would all connect. Unfortunately, I am in another country. However, we are there in spirit sitting under the big beautiful fig.  The deck is amazing, I love it. Is your outdoor shower going to be like Tyler & Todd's?  Theirs is amazing.  I knew when you said a you had a special lady coming... I knew it was your mum.  For some reason I could see the love coming from you.  AND sure enough it was your mum.  Nothing like a mother's love.  Have fun and give Occy a big hug and kiss.
Beautiful just beautiful what a great job. 👏👌♥️
I see deck now and Maybe a small cabin later or the work shop you wanted
Occy the jungle dog is THE BEST!!!  Your great too Max.  Simon, fantastic work and sweet Jake is adorable too. Loving the deck.  Your mom is so beautiful!
Way to go Simon what a Good Friend you are 🫶🏻
The deck looks amazing ! Congratulations Max, and what a great help from Simon and your neighbor ☀️
MOM… 🙋🏼‍♀️ Max, The deck is awesome! Big thanks to Simon for his help! Great video - as always!
Van cleaning short cuts:  Open all of the doors so the breeze can blow the fuzzy things out. Drape the bedding over the backdoors & put all of the dirty dishes on the ground so the dogs will wash them.
No Max he said dick not deck.  Those Kiwi’s and their funny accents.
Amazing!!!!!! Simon you’re awesome for helping Max 🙌🏾 So glad to see Mom ❤
Thanks for helping this guy Simon, what a champ.  Still can't stop loving someone else's dog, Occy, such a good companion.  The yard looks good, but you're keeping the house/cabin off limits I see.  Nice RV deck, and a top tier/upper deck forthcoming, wow.  And Yay, your beautiful mother has come for her first visit!  Enjoy that time like no other buddy.  P.S.  Please don't skip anymore weekends from us if possible ;)
Que linda mamá,  y genial proyecto 💚 Ya un pequeño domo de cristal en el techo y a meditar con las estrellas ✨️🌌🌠
Omg max and occy  what a job it's amazing love it ...enjoy every min with your mum xxx
The decking looks awesome Max , Occy is enjoying it for sure. Huge thank you to Simon for helping you out.  So great to see you and your Mom , what a beautiful smile she has when she seen you at the airport. Paws Up 🐾🐾 to you and Occy .. Catch ya on the flip side .. Cheers☕☕☕☕
Very nice
Like you always say.  "Bluddy awesome" and that for the most special person in anyone's life.  So glad to see you soo happy Max.😅
So sweet to see you with your mum. Great job on the deck, it looks awesome!  Must of been nice to see your results of your labor so quickly.
excellent video. thank you !!
Definately an amazing deck, with Occy as a supervisor you can’t go wrong,& he has given his seal of approval, job well done Simon & yourself. You mum is gorgeous, until next time, stay strong & Be Kind Always.
🎉🎉. Well done Max that deck is a thing of beauty...it ain't going nowhere any time soon....❣️❣️❣️.    Be blessed by time shutting off the world and spending time with your mum ❤️❤️❤️.  See you soon....God bless you and protect you always....❣️
Looks great
Your happiness and enthusiasm for life is so apparent. It is contagious when watching your videos and my find myself smiling the whole time.  I love the new deck!
Simon’s a keeper!
Simón is handsome !!! He is single???
Awe! Beautiful job Max & Simon!  Your mom is beautiful and must be so proud! ❤
Max, you’re a very thoughtful person, and the Holy Spirit of the Living God; Jesus put Occy in one of my dreams. He does that often and there are other individuals, but Occy is the first animal. God knows I love animals and people and pray for you all on YouTube.  There are times that I do unsubscribe and especially around October 31 and other issues around spirituality that is not of God. If the Lord brings them to mind again I will re-subscribe.  I love the people, I just don’t love the dark spiritual garbage that comes from that part of it. ~Which leads into what comes out of our mouths is apparently what is in our hearts. I tend to think of you, Max as a guy with a heart of gold and you’re generally so smiley and upbeat and positive , even in tough (understated) times~and sadness and suffering can overcome and it’s perfectly natural to cry or be somber. It is actually refreshing to see people being genuine and sharing so others can feel free to be likewise~ sets a great example. And, what comes out of our mouth definitely does set a tone and it does kind of tell where we’re at in purity vs. impure; and when you say words that are equivalent to defecation especially when you are talking about exclamations with the word Holy, it really sounds like you need deliverance from Jesus. We’re not all perfect and neither am I and yes I have spoken some words but I definitely would never equate anything with holiness with a something ugly. It is a habit but it can also be a spirit that wants to make things ugly as well. Spirituality is real, there is a spirit realm, ( it’s not ‘mother earth’).  God has created it with Himself in it and He gave us the spark of life at conception , Look it up the scientists found that out. God the Father and Jesus knit us in our mother’s womb and gave us the breath of life when we were born.  Proverbs 4:23 - 27 says, “Keep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life. Put away from you crooked speech and put devious talk far from you. Let your eyes look directly forward and you guys be straight before you. Ponder the path of your feet; then all your ways will be sure.  Do not swerve to the right or to the left;  turn your foot away from evil.” The whole of Proverbs 4 is pretty good. The word of God is alive because the Holy Spirit is there with you. The reason I mention it is because you got so much going for you and I care enough to tell you that you can make it even better.   So let your heart of gold get cleaned up with Jesus. He’s the only one that can actually do the job because His blood purifies. Sending much love,  In Christ.
Yea Simon! That deck and deck the view is stunning!!
Looks great, Max. Have fun with mom! Can't wait to see the rest.
Amazing Max. It is so beautiful and your jungle boy will love having his deck. Once the shower is in place it will be easier to give Occy a wonderful shower after a hard day being a jungle boy. Enjoy you time with your mom. Simon you are the best to help Max and Occy out. Enjoyed meeting Jake too.
Max, let’s be honest. We love you. The hair cut, not so much. Occy feels the same way, but he won’t tell you. He can’t - he’s a dog. And a great one, too.
What a beautiful lady !❤
Truly inspirational.
A Transatlantic shout out to the handsome Simon for crushing it!
Beautiful!  Just wondering why the van pad is so narrow.  I might drive off that thing. 😕
Your mom is so lovely, so nice to see the effort you put in to show your love for your mom. The deck looks spectacular
Bloody awesome deck! Your mom is beautiful ❤
The irony of you in actuaL nature listening to a tape about getting back to nature-based meditation. Oye vay 😂
So beautiful!!! Love it x
Simon, thanx for helping Max, you two had fun together, it showed. Max, looking great, it will be a great extra space for your van!
What an incredible deck! Well done. I can’t wait to see the “next level “! 😊
The termite "🦟"damage in the house really put you into wood super defender🦸‍♀mode.  You have a very admirable work ethic.  Para-social relationships are weird, but: I do love ♥OCCY🐶.  Hello to Max's lovely Mom.  Nice video.  Thanks.
Max, I'm refusing to watch any of your videos until you get that stupid haircut taken care off and look like a normal person again.
Everyone needs a friend like Simon:-) Excellent deck👌
Lovely place.
Simon is a champion and a great friend to have. Occy' new nick name should be Jungle Boy. Thanks for being such a promoter of caring for your mental health.... it's so important and the loss of it makes almost every aspect of your life seem so much harder. Deck is looking pretty spiffy! Hi Mum.
You are lucky to have such good help! The deck looks fantastic. Hello to your mom! You look like her! Love from Texas
What a great video and great friends. Can’t wait to see more of the build. I can see such a family resemblance between you and your Mom. ❤😊
Wow, the deck looks amazing.  Simon, thank you for helping Max, that was a lot of work!  Enjoy the time with your Mom.
Your videos make me smile. Thank you for sharing your life with all of us.
One cup of tea and a back massage 😁
I knew it was going to be your mum❤! I am one, so this had me joyfully tearful🎉 Well done Max❤
Back massage would be lovely 😂 Deck looks great, you and Simon made a great working team!
❤ Simon you are definitely the man. Thank you so much for helping Max.. Now that's what I call a good foundation❤ I love it Max. It's gorgeous and so is your mama it's so good to see her. She's going to love that view❤ the land gets prettier every video. What a beautiful vacation spot ❤ I enjoyed this video o c c y is such a good boy give him a hug from me. See y'all next Sunday❤😊❤
Love it, great job lads!!  Nice to see your mum Max, enjoy your time together.  Hugs to you and Occy xx
I love Aussie dogs -- especially the four legged ones! It's a lot of fun watching such hard work while enjoying my morning coffee. Great job! Simon is indeed a best mate.
Love to try Headspace. Unfortunately the code reverts to 14 day trial once you install the app. Tips to get the 60 day to work?
That is beautiful. Nice work
Wow you have awesome friends just started watching you love your videos I'm terminally ill and you bring me joy 😊
Looks awesome!
Wow Max the deck looks stunning what a beautiful spot for you and Occy to hang out on.  Simon is such a legend to volunteer and share his time and skills with you mate for life there I’m sure.  You have done an amazing job and I’m looking forward to seeing the next part of it.  Enjoy a well deserved break with your beautiful mum.  🧡🧡🧡
Really well done Max!
Awesome skills, Simon! Hello, Mum!
Deck looks great,especially love the paw prints Occy made sure to include to claim it. 😃 hope you have a lovely visit with you mom.
Great job❤
rips his own roof off wonders why its raining in and than says "thanks asbestos" xD, bro its your own fault, no need to rip the roof off, wouldnt have died instantly from the asbestos and ripping it off released propably more fibers than just leaving it on
Max that deck is one of the best idea’s you’ve had and you and Simon took it to another level. Hugs to Occy ❤ Loved seeing your mom again.
Blown away! It's beautiful. SO MUCH WORK!! You've earned every bit of rest and beauty around you!
Accent sounding bogan?😜
I hope Occy puts his foot print in one of those.

I’m so jealous of your building skills.  Stunning build so far!  I’m in the midst of renovations and they are bloody exhausting.  Shambles.  It’s all well worth it in the end…
Deck looks great

Nice one❤

Simon, well done! Creative and solid engineering! Mum's reaction was perfect!

Wow, a genius idea...overlooking a cool view!
The videos are dope but that bs clickbait title?
I LOVE TROWELING THE CEMENT  ITS A FINISHED LOOK
Simons a champ for coming to help.  What an awesome idea to build out a deck for your van .  Asbestos sucks but it’s good to know that you’re doing it properly Cos that way you won’t have to worry about it again. You and your mum are dead ringers for one another, I can definitely see who you take after x  Love and support to you and your crew especially Occ ❤
Where do I order a Simon?  That's a friend who will step up on moving day, when the rest become scarce.  Simon is a wonderful reminder of how we can all be authentic in our friendships. Delightful deck Dale!  :)
Thanks for helping!  Simon, everyone should have friends like you.  I couldn’t even get my husband to help me with my deck.
I’m jealous.  You live in paradise.  So beautiful.  Speaking of beautiful, your mom is gorgeous! ❤❤❤
Love and peace to you both as always 🦘😘😘
👍
I have all the feels on this one. Even shed a few tears. When you indicated a female, I thought... perhaps a new lady in your life. When I realized it was your Mom...my heart melted. You are truly a beautiful person. I come here to feel all of that and this video was over the top beautiful. I'm here for it!
All for Occy!! ❤️😊
I love your deck!  You and Simon did a great job with it!  I can't wait to see what the other plans are for it!
Max i know your not done with the deck but it is pretty cool so far, and a special place for your mom to stay while she is visiting.
Welcome back Max! We miss you and Occy🎉🎉
It's not you home if it hasn't got your blood...sweat and tears involved in it!!
That’s quite a beautiful deck! Occy looked so proud of you and I KNOW you mom is. Can’t wait to see more. You’re TALENTED!
Max & Simon great job!! Excellent to see you wearing masks with that concrete dust? Max you are a high achiever which is to be admired! The deck looks strong & professional…. great design! 👍🤗💙🇦🇺 🖤💛❤️ PS Hi Max’s Mum 😊
Perfection! Bloody beautiful
Dope deck!! So much hard work. Yikes
Its beautifull Max, Simon and Jack. You can be super proud 🤩
Anyone else try to sign up for 60 day trial of headspace & only get 14?
Way to be Simon!
Meditation deck, after this deck……around that gorgeous tree!
Things are really coming together! Simon and Jack - you are true legends! Hugs to Jake and Occ. Greets to Mum!
What a great friendship!!! The beauty continues to amaze me; ❤❤
Oh, how sweet! I thought your visitor was going to be an unrelated special lady, and here it turns out to be your mum! A special lady indeed, but very related! I hope you have a wonderful time together! Oh, yeah, great job on the deck!
Looks very nice!  Your mom looks so kind ❤ hoop to meet u one day
I actually teared up with joy when your Mom arrived. A huge big up to Simon for helping out. Fabulous video Max, thank you for sharing. XO from Colorado
Max I’ve been following you for six years. You bring light to my darkness because I have clinical depression. Do me a favor, cut the mullet. It doesn’t become you.
Well done Simon, Max & Occy, great team effort. enjoy yr time with you Mum.
Nice
Hey Max, do you have merchandise available?? I couldn’t find it on your website, love the message on the shirts!! ❤❤❤❤
Your mom is beautiful
Wow! What another really fabulous video yet again! Simon is great too! Mum arriving will be super fun, so looking forward to next video! Bravo!
Oh my gosh! All that hard work and sweat, it looks amazing. I love how you use natural tones and wood that compliment your surroundings. I get the distinct feeling the land you own is loving you back 🌳
WOW.... that looks freaking awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you Simon! Helping Max on this phenomenal project as he develops his dream home is greatly appreciated! This is an exciting improvement to quality of life and gives you so much more flexibility while you renovate! Much love from Florida - Nana Rock ⭐️

Excellent video thank you so much. Give that big furry dog a hug for me.

I teared up when I realized it was your Mum!! I thought you were just trying to impress a prospective girlfriend...this is MUCH more special!
The deck looks amazing..😁🤗 nice one Simon , helping out..🤗😁👍🏻. Hi Max’s mom..😁 can’t wait to see what’s coming next week end…😁🤗👍🏻
Beautiful.  And have a lovely visit with Mom!
I felt a bit bad, watching this lovely episode in PJs from my cozy sofa with a big plate of home-made food and lemonade 😆
That's going to be an amazing space! Thanks for sharing the process!
You're right..Everything is for Occy.. he is after all the 👑🤭
Mad props to Simon 👏 That's what mateship looks like. That weekend was HOT you've done really well . Things are really moving on and looking fine
Thank you for posting regularly Max, living in the US I can live vicariously through you and even Occy ❤ you’re doing an amazing job mate.  Cheers.
Max and Occy love your show. But you have fallen for the three card trick, it's called MARKETING. You are their poster boy.Pretty sad for a guy that just wanted to do his own thing.
Welcome to paradise, mom!❤
Your deck is awesome!
Thanks for the update! It’s so evident that you’re in a great space mentally, emotionally and habitat wise. Well done, so happy for you🤗👏🏻
love to see the process
Looks like a boat deck with cabana if it were on water 😊
06:46 Classic Big Brother move, hey Occy? "My stick!" he says. Chomp chomp! That's okay, Jake ... there's plenty to go around. 😊❤
So beautiful ❤ Your such a blessing to everyone ❤❤
Awe...mums are the best! ✌️
Wow, Max! I love it. You both will be very happy with his new deck.
I am singularly impressed with your vision, your tenacity, and your love of life. Your project will stun even you when you are done. Making solid new friendships along the way is leading to a better life for you and Occy going forward. Your Mom has an amazing son.
The deck looks amazing! What a great crew to help you (Simon and the neighbour 🫶🏽) We truly live the most beautiful part of Australia.😃
ILL TAKE A BACK MESSAGE! hahaha
Nice deck🎉
Oh wow it looks amazing 😍😍
Happy Sunday Max, Occy, Simon, Jake, and Mom!. The deck looks amazing. Great job! I hope you are keeping yourself properly hydrated when working so hard and sweating. Got to keep yourself healthy.
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👍👍👍
What a beautiful deck!  Simon, you did a wonderful job helping Max. How a follower becomes a helping friend. Wish you a very good time with your mom! Lots of hugs to Occy ❤
Amazing! Hard work  always pays off.
I love the deck, Max! It seems like your van will be staying there for a while, and the deck might even outrun the lifespan of the van! 😆
Nice work, gorgeous results. Enjoy your Mom visit.
Have an amazing time with your beautiful  mum ❤
Yahoo momma is visiting! Enjoy 😊🇨🇦
Lovely deck build Max. Enjoy your time with your mother, the best times are with the family & loved ones ❤. I wish one day I would be able visit your wonderful space
You have a amazing friend (Simon )& neighbor!! Beautiful deck & view. Your deck build was well planned out!!   Great job making your mom's stay fantastic in the van! 💙🌴🌴  ps when you work this hard & sweat make sure you are getting electrolytes. electrolyte = salt, magnesium,  & potassium. You can either just add a good quality salt to your water and then take magnesium & potassium pill before bed or buy electrolytes powder and add to your water. The magnesium and potassium will also help to provent your muscles from aching.
I see a 2-tier deck building built?! That would be amazing
I always wish your videos were longer. ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
please cut your hair
Hi Max, your deck is awesome!
❤❤ the deck! Score on the rental! Enjoy your Mom visit!
Great job! How wonderful to have made a new friend. Have a lovely time with your mum. Your property is gorgeous.xx
How awesome of Simon to lend his skills 💪🙏🏻
Wonderful deck. I'm sure you, Occy and your mom will have a great time using it to have long talks, good meals and great coffee.  Maybe you'll get your hair properly cut in honor of your mom visiting. Enjoy your time together. 😃
You reparked the van after the first drone shot, you little perfectionist 😂
Absolutely gorgeous
You are just brilliant and what a fantastic mate Simon turned out to be 👍🏻welcome to mom ❤️ xxx
Amazing work, well done 🎉🎉
Nice job max! Had no idea you’d be building it the fit the van, and glad you didn’t tell us until you showed us. Epic!
At least make a pony tail. The mullet churns my gullet. 🤢😉
Simply amazing job, Max!🎉
That deck looks amazing. Fair play to your friend Simon for helping out 🎉
Awesome video, Max. I freaking LOVE IT!
Absolutely ossum! Your spirit, creativity and humor are mind blowing....how proud must your mom be😊❤❤❤
Max you’re an all around inspiration! If you haven’t subscribed, now is the time !
💕💕🎶🎶
Best mum ever. Hard to believe you and Simon aren't old friends.
Don't embarrass OccY!
Wow what a wonderful thing to do for your mom . She's beautiful . Thanks for sharing  . The deck is awesome and so are you . ❤
Wow blown away by every video how incredibly stunning your home is. Loving getting to watch the progress, and the quality of your work is 👌
This is so fabulous!
You boys on your grass cutting toys 🧸
Simon you are a legend .. your place is looking good Max 👍
AANNND, You are one of the coolest blokes ever mate.
*be kind* is my new level up. I still have hard things to say, because I still live in the trenches. But we can be kind, where we used to be cruel.
Wonderful reason to build Max your lovely Mum ….job So well done & Max haș supervised So well 🩵😂😂😂🐾🐾….🩵💗🩵

Max! You mentioned in your last vid that you're happier than you've been in a long time, buddy IT SHOWS! This was such a fun, happy video to watch, great to see your Mum at the end too, she's such a beauty.
That is all awesome, and to see you and your Mom is absolutely wonderful. As a Mom, I know she is incredibly proud of you and all you have accomplished! Enjoy your visit!!
Simon is a pleasure, nice job gentleman.  Going to be spectacular.  Hugs to the puppies.
Thank you to Simon and your neighbor for helping you with your project. Big hello to your mom, too.
Wow you both did pretty good at the wood work, your mate did a fantastic job it’s getting there 👍
Oh and I thought this was a lady friend :p and also that he lived closer to his family. Good thing he gets to see his mom!
Love your videos! Wish they were weekly because I miss you!
That deck is super impressive Max. Churrr! Well done, it looks incredible
Absolutely epic deck build!! Can’t wait to see the second level. That will have amazing views!
Looks great mate! Wish you used some nice merbeau decking tho because those composite boards really expand and contract like crazy out in the elements those mitre cuts will look on the piss but otherwise love your work ❤
A job doing is a job worth doing well. Continue to take pride in your work and smooth those concrete blobs 😉
perfect!
Wow! Super impressive 👏🏻👏🏻
I still think the deck building would have been funnier if you were a Kiwi
Youv'e got some explainin to do mate, I'm telling ya.
It was a pleasure to meet you at the van diaries meet up. Thanks for the sticker
Just love your wholesome videos ❤ you have your mother’s beautiful smile
Great mate Simon
Great job on the deck!  Can’t wait to see it finished😊
Hello from California. A great way to start my Sunday morning. I was watching TV in bed (6:19 AM).  I thought let’s see what’s new on YouTube. Woohoo Max & Occy!
You digging reminded me as a kid in UK was told you keep digging you'll end up in Australia 😂😂.. were you told same keep digging you'll end up in uk.. 😊.... Simon done a good job helping you .... all keeping you fit too..looking good  max ..
Simon rocks!
Good mornin 🖐😎👍
I have rarely seen such a poorly built house. Every German gazebo is more stable and of course waterproof. You have a lot of work to do to erase and avoid all the mistakes the previous builder made
What the eff is Aaa? Efff Hell? 😢😢😢
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Your health, I’d look after in a minute. The mullet, would be gone in a second… 😂😂
Sorry mate. Can't see the point.
Good grief, I’m insomniac, it is 3:02 am on the big island, hawaaian islands, adore your updates...
😁👋👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Welcome home. I wondering over from your Canadian adventure. Your doggie is adorable being a cow eating the grass. Thanks for sharing your home.
Great cost cutting skills with the plant hire mate,your patch of heaven is stunningly beautiful 👌👊
Nothing like working on your land!   I love this idea and am building something similar in central FL.  Land for a van lifer to hide, store stuff and work on projects.
love ya work! inspiring to do something similar
I'm hope you won't give up on the cabin, but you always had the van to lean on.   Great deck 👏 here is to tiny home living 🥳  And the best part, seeing the love between you and your mom, made my eyes a bit watery
Yeah! Max and Occy back at it! :D
Good morning I am watching from Kentucky 😊
Love it, enjoy your family time! Xx
Was that your drone crashing 🫣
Epic deck! We are intersecting projects again Max. All of my deck materials were ordered on Friday and work begins tomorrow! The only difference is mine will be portable (no concrete in the ground) because I don't want to pay to pull a permit when I haven't decided where I want it to be permanently located. Post covid brought out all of the inspectors! so I kissed a bunch of cash goodbye and hired an architect in June so everything will be expensively legal by next year. I also have a "barbie" lol did I spell that right? ready bcz I love to grill and will be putting out my van's solar/waterproof bluetooth speakers and lights. Dance party preparations.
Amazing. Just wow. So nice to see your lovely mum. x
Nice job on the deck!
