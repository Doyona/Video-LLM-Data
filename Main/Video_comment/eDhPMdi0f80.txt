Actually faster than my dad left would be a metaphor because it does not use the terminology of like or as it would be a simile if the sentence was “ As fast as my dad left” or “Like how fast my dad left” so that’s why it’s a metaphor and not a simile
Do the If the Vegan teacher was president
That's why nobody trusts females to be president
If only she was a history teacher
Do if math teachers ran the government
The comments number 💀💀

*Air raid siren goes off*  Soldier: I gotta go now! *Tries to run out* Teacher: *grabs shirt and pulls the soldier back* Soldier: AYO WE BOUTTA GET NUKED I GOTTA GO AND HELP THOSE PEOPLE!!!

To correct you it’s actually a metaphor
My dad never came back with the milk 😭
Army soldier: everybody’s going to die!  Teacher/president: oh I like the use of the hyperboles
I hate english teach hahah
New rule:HOMEWORKS FOREVER
When he says that “all of America will be gone faster than my dad left” he says it’s a simile but in reality it is a metaphor because they compare two things without like or as
Me: qiet kid can you com backkkkk? Him: SURE😈 **kills** Me: thank you

John 3:16 “for God so loved the world he sacrificed his one and only son” put your faith in God

This is what the president of north korea said after he realized the president is the English teacher: 도대체 그 미국 대통려은 뭐였지? 영어 선생님? 생각보다쇠웠어요! 그것은 제스판의한 조각이자 개자식이었다!
Lol they needed a smarter president
Sorry if im in all caps
WHY THE ALL THESE PRESIDENTS NOT TRYING TO BE MEAN BUT THEY AREN T THAT SMART AS YOU THINK OR WANT THEM TO BE
That English teacher is a fraud, it wasn’t a similie
Wow

The George Washington in the back lol I cant
POV: joe biron
English teachers watching this video be like: “faster than my dad left” is not a simile because it doesn’t have like or as. It was an analogy because it was comparing the similarities of 2 different things and putting it in a stressful situation
It’s a methaphor
This is why woman's can't be President
I love how it’s a metaphor, not a simile
The hyperbole had me rolling cause my teacher keep talkin bout them😂😂😂🙄🙄🙄🙄
If a english teacher is president and korea sends a missile for america bet you theyd just yell "KOREA DOESNT DISMISS YOU I DO"
Bro this is so true. I live in England.
Actually simile states thing typically uses like or as. But metaphors just state that one thing is another and usually not needing like or as
That president is stupid
You forgot them going on maternity leave 😭😭 hilarious anyways
It’s not a simile…ITS A METAPHORE
It is a metaphor since it does not use like or as stupid
U.S.A:  If you don’t give us the launch codes, our state will be gone quicker than my dad left English Teacher: *so deep*
That my friend, was a metaphor.
That was a metaphor. Not a simile.
We’re fucked
The best part was that was a metaphor, not a simile
No guys theres yellow curtains so the president so shes really nervous because the color of the curtains say everyone in the worlds inner thoughts
It wasn’t a simile
wahahahahahah 😐
Me being a smart(no no word), “faster than my dad left” ain’t a simile cause it does not have like or as in it
This is the exact reason that if a girl gets into office she needs to be a bitch about everything
“Faster than my dad left” Can relate
Thers a reson whay english teachers are english teachers and presidents are presidents
You know there is a island just 55 miles from Florida and it was out of our country and it was sending missiles to the United states and the u.s. was trying to get the troops ready and they got them on a spy plane and they saw the missiles on the camera.Then the president called the country told them to get the missiles out of the sky or else. He said I'll give you 24h
his dad left and decided to go to the military
“Ma’am, we need to counter North Korea’s attack!”  English Teacher President:   *“Idk, can we?”*
Is it me or dose he look like Obama?
Don’t look up be like
The teacher: if you could tell me what's 10 / 2 and - 2 + 69 and - 60 and + 70
Not to be a English teacher, but that was a metaphor, not a simile, similes use like or as to compare, while metaphors don't
:Trump br like
Grave:  RIP ‘Mrs English Teacher’  From: 19** — 20**  Last words: ‘that’s a really good simile-AhAhAaAAAaaah!’

Nerd moment: similes use like or as "those missiles will wipe out America faster than my dad left me" does not contain like or as there for it is a metaphor
Man said faster was a similie🤣🤣
“Actually, if you knew anything you would know that the missiles intercepting each other represents sending the sky( the symbol of peace) on fire and the shrapnel represents the broken people of the countries”

Simile > metaphor
Faster than my dad left is actually a metaphor not  a simile
Metaphor not simile
Actually it's metaphor, *aggressivly snacks lips*
This video makes me mad
How is a metaphor different from simile? While both similes and metaphors are used to make comparisons, the difference between similes and metaphors comes down to a word. Similes use the words like or as to compare things—“Life is like a box of chocolates.” In contrast, metaphors directly state a comparison—“Love is a battlefield.”
That wasn't even a simile. She isn't really an English teacher.
thats ⏃ hmetaphore not simile
At the end of the video it’s actually it’s a metaphor because a simile compares two things using like or as.
Thats what would happen if the president was a girl. Jkjk its just a joke lol
Man could have at least given Ms.President the decency of an appropriate outfit.

Europe just watching over the Atlantic:

When you realize 'Faster than my dad left' was actually a metaphor
“Faster than my dad left”, is not a simile, it’s a hyperbole.
This is why teachers are not presidents

SMH faster then my dad left is a metaphor

This is true for a language teacher but if it where a history teacher it be different
Hello Mrs President, but just wanted to say that they launched that missile using a form action and not a form of communication, so there are no good vibes here, a missile is in the sky, so ple- (dies*)
BEANS
That’s not a silie
Its a metaphor not a simalie
Thats not a simile
Mr president, the rocket represents a giant missile that’s going to blow the good vibes to kingdom come

Not a simile a metaphor
My English teacher would never say "good vibes"
i dont get why an english teacher specifically  since they usually have other subjects (for example history) to teach
I can see why North Korea wanted her dead..
True tho
https://youtube.com/shorts/9h3H8KZweKQ?feature=share
I think the reason why he said the English teacher is a female is because have you ever had a male English teacher
You think joe can remember the code ?
I thought this was about joe Biden at first 😂😂😂
The conditional "if" calls for the subjunctive mood: If an English Teacher *were* President
Damn
This lowkey piss me off
"It was TEEEEEEEEECHNICALLY a metaphor" Some random English teacher

i’m positive english teachers weren’t loved as children, they’re all so annoying and take their minimum wage jobs way too serious
That's not a simile
“Faster than my dad left” is actually not a simile since he did not use like or as to compare it to America getting wiped out. It would be more of a metaphor rather than a simile. I know everybody wanted this and your day would not be complete unless you saw this comment. You’re welcome
Best Korea NOOOOOO!

It's ironic that there is a grammatical error in the title. It should be "were" rather than "was".

10 Of The World's Funniest One Liners!  1. Few women admit their age; few men act it. 2. If everything is coming your way, then you're in the wrong lane. 3. Why is "abbreviation" such a long word?   4. The Big Bang Theory: God Spoke and BANG! it happened.  5. You can't have everything; where would you put it?  6. Nobody's perfect. I'm a nobody. 7. Nothing is fool proof to a sufficiently talented fool. 8. Who is "General Failure" and why is he reading my hard disk?  9. The more people I meet, the more I like my dog.  10. Everywhere is walking distance if you have the time.    Editorial: Maybe the most thought-provoking one-liners is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com

There's a good joke in here somewhere. I'll find it.

It’s not a simile because a simile uses as/like
Dude could you imagine history teachers as president  "Sir, north Korea has just launched a nuclear offense on the United States"  "This is just like August 6th, 1945"
.... everyone knows that when someone says I don't know can you, you say, well then yes!
You mean like in Stargate?
Nice woodland
“Faster than my dad left” isn’t a simile Similes use “like” or “as” Example: ur mom is as big as a continent (true fact) Not that anyone cares, just thought u might want to know
Xdd
ppl think this is a joke but Biden would do this
Then she blames you for not taking the nuclear launch codes
It's the navy suit for me

The English teacher still has that hoodie on, nice
“Faster than my dad left* that wasn’t a simile that was a metaphor. Simile’s use “like” or “as”
They don’t trace respect for other people
Lesson learned never let an english teacher be a politician.
She died just as quick
It’s Madam President
Why is this actually true
Ya, imagine if a drama teacher was the preiminister of Canada(truedue)
"no phones in america"
Nice cold war era navy uniform lol

Maths teacher:  calculate the speed of your dad leaving and the bomb speed

Um Mrs. English teacher that was a metaphor are you an impostor 🤨
Uuuuh actually that’s not a simile, it’s a metaphor because similes are a comparison of two things using “like” or “as”, and he said “than”.

Thank you for actually making funny shorts there are so many cringey ones nowadays
Actually, "faster then my dad left" is a metaphor and not a simile, so that english teacher is a FRAUD
"The bell doesn't dismiss you the nukes do"
Akshually 🤓 "Faster than my dad left" is a metaphor rather than a simile due to the fact that there is no "like" or "as" to compare it.
Lol I don't know what is more funny a English teacher as the president our a Women as President
“Actually, if you knew anything you would know that the missiles intercepting each other represents sending the sky( the symbol of peace) on fire and the shrapnel represents the broken people of the countries”
Hey, the sky won't mean "good vibes" after the nuke smacks into the White House and literally turns the entire sky black.
