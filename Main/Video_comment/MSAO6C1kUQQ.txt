Grealish scores first City goal as City put FIVE past Norwich! 😎 | Manchester City 5-0 Norwich | EPL Highlights
Siiiuu
Imagine scoring in your debut and THAT is your goal
Ew stinky grealish
I knew Manchester City F.C. Would win because Norwich has a disadvantage against Manchester City, because Manchester City has won the premier league 6 times.
Im not quite sure why, but i have become so bored of watching premiership football, i am a lifelong city fan but i think im going to cancel all subscriptions and give it all a miss for a while.
Either 5-0 or not at all
Torres is really underrated
Everybody is overrated when Ronaldo cost less then Dan James regardless of his age
Look at the state of him I’m so glad he joined city and not United 😂
"VAR is a joke no goal" 0:54
Grealish and gabriel R 2 g's together
As a Norwich fan Man City played well we just need better defence.
Man City are preparing his statue this weekend to commemorate his 10 years in advance Legendary status.
LOL i thought these were the arsenal highlights!
I would be shocked if Norwich even get a point this season!!
Why is grealish celebrating like he scored a screamer
Grealish goal should win the Puskas it was so good
Grealish knew less about that goal than I knew about my gcses
You payed a hundred mil for this
What a goal from grealish defo worth the 100 mil
Grealish didnt mean to score the ball hit his knee 😅😅😅 couldnt get worser
He didn't know anything about it
I could have scored against this shower!
Did Norwich field a defence? First 10/15 minutes fair enough maybe they caught you out but the manager just stood there thinking “someone better change this before we get hammered”
I know people may be laughing and saying that goal wasn’t on purpose by grealish but his positioning was perfect at the back post to set that opportunity up for himself. He uses a fake run perfectly to gain himself space from the centre back
Think grealishes debut goal is the worst ever it wasn’t just a tap in it was a deflection he didn’t realise it even went in
Title of today’s highlight: Norwich gets thrashed for the 300th time
Can’t understand the stick that Grealish is getting for scoring a goal. Yeah, I agree that it’s not a classic, but you have to be in the right place at the right time to score.   I heard that he had kissed the badge, but I didn’t see that. As a Villa fan I hope it isn’t true. I don’t blame Jack for leaving the Villa and the prospect of playing champions league this season. I just hope that we can get ourselves into a position where we can resist the outside pressure of money bags clubs like City. Nobody can dispute that City have bought their success, but who hasn’t? I can think of only one side that has over-performed in direct relation to their expenditure, and that is Leicester City. Although, there has been significant investment in recent years.  Up the Villa!
It bounced off him - didn't it
Jack grealish with an awful goal
pitty about his little Puffy haircut
Look how empty the stadium is😂😂😂
The jack grealish was litterly just a easy tap in
To score your first City goal with a screamer like that. Go on Jack lad.
That touch and finish from mhariz was nice but at 4-0 and such time and space I’d have loved to have seen something fancy, flick over the head and volley, or an overhead kick from range
OK Sky, Grealish scored from a deflection, so what? that doesn't mean that he'll be the next Wayne Rooney.
Every Single City Goal was accidental looking because they have no proper strikers and hopefully won’t win this year!!!!
Grilish score by mistake😀
jacks hamstring coming in clutch 1:04
Is Sterling only going to score tap ins so he can stay at city
Top 3 biggest accidents that have ever happened: 1) Dinosaurs 2) My Birth 3) Grealish’s Goal
City still the most boring team in football
700 Aston Villa fans disliked. Fun fact: Grealish didn't mean to score that.. it was a bad first touch which went in. Lucky.
0:33 he was fouled by himself...
The best YoYo club in the UK is at it again, Norwich, for relegation?
The views on this compared to everyone else’s highlights… CITY ARE MASSIVE 😂
Canary's must have been in the coal mine before the game, their players are asleep when they should be marking.
Forest fan here but can we just respect how good torres is even if the goal was disallowed
that's not even a goal it just bounced off him!! just a case of right place right time.
I knew I should have put grealish as my captain on fantasy. Salah only got 3 points!
Norwich get back to the championship please, waste of time
Walkers passing and the movement of Jesus down that right hand side was brilliant
Bruh city spent 100M just for Grealish to accidentally score a tap in
Jesus played a brilliant game
It’s meant to be 6-0
Good performance by city, still not firing on all cylinders just yet mind bit like my club, pains me to say this but if I was a betting man money would be on chelsea this season, they clearly have the beating of city & lfc, close race mind but my prediction is 1st chelsea 2nd city & either man utd or lfc 3rd/4th. Best league in the world for football 👍
That is the best commentator
City its so sheet,  when it come to big team they can't beat them , but small teams they beat them hahah, so s sheet overated club wit no fans,
Norwich defending is soooo bad
Poor Krul
English players seems to do well when playing with professional players from overseas ☺️
how dare man city remove 1,000 seats and ad another advertising board :(    football is dying
Norwich have become the very definition of the "yo yo" club. I have no doubt they will be relegated once again this season and get promoted again at the end of next season. They have been promoted and relegated in each of the last four seasons and it looks like they are going for five,
Man city have some great players can't imagine why we didn't buy any of them
Gabi Jesus today is what City fans expected Grealish to be
Empty seats as usual
Jack Grealish going and scoring the most West Brom goal you could imagine
Norwich in
Norwich are such an annoying club, depending on which league they are in only two teams can be relegated or promoted because you can guarantee Norwich will be the third.
😏
100 million you're having a laugh
Mahrez is the best player in city I know you don't like to hear that but is the truth
This is bullying 😂
Kyle  just doesn’t get enough recognition. What a baller.
jesus playing out of his mind
€1
Jeez Gabriel mad
Norwich defenders caught ball watching balls in behind..
Is they’re still Covid restrictions in Manchester why’s the ground half empty
As a Chelsea fan I'm absolutely buzzing for grealish
Why is there so many empty seats for? Even Arsenal and Manu have nearly all the seats booked.
Kyle walker turned himself to De bruyne 😅😂😎😎😎
Torres great player
Norwich could have won this
0:32 In what world is this a foul? This sport is a joke.
Overrated tourist league..
All The fans in the full. House
Grealish the nancy with the female headband
It might only be Norwich but teams like Utd, Chelsea, etc, won't get as many 5-0's against those sort of teams as City will.
that was KRUL
Get it right he didn't score actually,the ball scored by hitting him.
Ah ok....so Norwich are joining Arsenal in the relegation battle ! 🎟
A bad return to the Premier league for Norwich
What an amazing finish by Grealish! Ballon D’or winner 100% absolutely class!
im 56 and from manchester (although a liverpool fan,as its more a peoples club)  back in the day the only city fans lived there,,now they are everywhere,,why -- they got money
buy buy buy,,easy when you buy it all
Dad G.   PQ
So that's what a 100 million pound goal looks like 😱😱
Norwich up for a look and down again
A finish from Grealish that Martin Demichelis would be proud of
Just so everyone understands man city was playing against Norwich 🤨
Rubbish he knew nothing about it as it hit off his knee
Well done
OMG
Norwich are getting relegated
Great start budgies 0 for 8 against  keep it up
What a game for jesus
2:18 I broke my toe the other day from challenging someone like that don't do it it is not worth it
Grealish is one of the few players to score from a deflection without it being an own goal 😂
I wonder who is going straight back down again and again and again......
Jesus had a great game today
Grealish did not mean to do that it just bounced off him
Norwich could break records this season... in a bad way
I like how they showed norwich's only shot all game :)
Villa sell Grealish to City for £100m, he scored a lucky deflection goal for his first goal. Villa buy Ings for £30m, he scores a f*ckin bicycle kick immediately. Villa are laughing all the way to the bank at the moment
Horrific defence by Norwich
WHAT A GOAL BY GREALISH🥵🥵🥵
Those empty seats though 😂
Grealish 100mill and didnt know anything about his fluke of a goal. Over rated typical brit as usual
Norwhich didn’t even turn up. Embarrassing defending
Big wow
Norwich are too good for Championship and far too weak for Premiership. There needs to be a league between the two with the likes of West Brom, Norwich, Bournemouth, etc.
shark team
Nice to see noone wanted to comment (including on match of the day) on the blatant dive by the Norwich player that resulted in a perfectly fine goal by Man City being chalked off at 1-0. As if that wasn’t enough then you get the Norwich players having the audacity to surround the referee screaming for a foul. Ludricrous decision, Jon Moss and Graham Scott, Specsavers offer a buy one get one free on pairs of glasses, I suggest you both go and get sight tests you blind imbosils. No wonder Pep was going mad. 🙄🙄
Everyone hates city when they do bad but then hate when they do good 😂 sour people just jealous of others success
If only Newcastle played like this😩
0:32 What 😳 🤣🤣🤣😅😅
Ball hit Garlic gets inside a net and everyone’s eyes on him :D wt
they payed 100m for grealish to score an accidental goal
Grealish goal was luck because it just came of his knee and went in
My nan could score against Norwich mate .
That norwich defending is atrocious,Valuable playing time this season for gilmour and a big learning curve for him just hope playing for this team doesn't get his head down
Back to The Championship Norwich go.
City are like the posh kid at school who gets everything bought for him and parents know the teachers
Thats why they paid 100 million 😂😂
City fans going mental they beat newly promoted Norwich lol.
Jack looked like my little sister when frozen was on the tv at Christmas times
What is it with Norwich and the prem they get there then there crap lol
This result helped my FFPL. I have Dias at this time.
Terrible defending
If ever we there was a side who turned up expecting to lose 5-0 it was Norwich today
Next time they might sell all their tickets instead of having to give them away 10 Bob club
Anyone notice how the commentators celebrate when city score, but when Norwich had that one shot they couldn't care less 😅
Krul dives with a satellite delay.
Man City fans only sing when they are winning .
What a game G.Jesus had well played
3 Sunday league goals and 2 decent ones. They all count I suppose
Looks like a lot of empty seats
Look at all those empty seats and they tell us they're a big club 😂😂😂
Too easy against a very poor team on the day..
I bet they'd love to play Norwich every week.
If Arsenal let in more than 5, I won’t be shocked tbh
It's Norwich ffs..  Newcastle will put 5 past them... Worst team in the PL.. City will probably win the league now...lmao
Watching Jack Grealish score for Man City felt like watching my ex getting off with a mate. Man City were on fire though and could have easily scored more.
Was thinking that finally the red had the bottle to not give a clear dive on that 2nd goal, then he completely went back on it
that jack hrelish goal was a joke he dident even know he score ahah that how crap he is
Is it me or did Grealish have no idea how to celebrate his goal ? 🤣
Pep has gone Manc a little lol Jesus's 'Mam and Dad'
They are now 5th place
Absolutely poor woeful commentary. It's like all pundits have this naive view that football is only played at the oil laden ( ex Stockport fan base ) stadium. Its not as though they have done anything in Europe. ??? Grielish 100 million absolute master class like last week at spurs ( garbage )
100 Mil justifying Wonder goal by Grealish right there.
The Abu Dhabi Rangers can't fail. They will ini everything.
Realistically, Grealish was not worth 100mil and his first goal was clear luck that it hit his thigh 😂didn’t know what he was doing
I’m sorry but that 4th goal was clearly offside. I’m all for them being a bit more relaxed with the VAR but that wasn’t even close. They need to be consistent in the all the games.
All the money in the world… still can’t fill their stadium 🤣🤣 tinpot club.
Flat track bullies. No cojones
0:33 nice dive!
Money well spent on grealish
hand ball
Norwich’s left back is awful
Very lame noise from the city fans
What a great win, Guardiola best manager ever
Let go jacky let's go jacky
a 5-0 win and they still can’t fill the stadium and the cheer when they score is quiet
After watching the villa game I then realise how little fans they have embarrassing
Yay! Some atmosphere
As good as Man City are, Norwich were absolutely horrendous, can't see them scraping more than 15 points this season
Thanks City, on behalf of fantasy football ⚽️
Stadium empty, as per usual
I expected grealish’s goal to be like a curl out side of the box for £100 million not a tap in with his knee
How you going Norwich the 2 champions of the last two premier league campaigns in their first 2 matches. What a violation
Genuinely, what is the point of Norwich?  Especially after selling Buendia….waste of space
this true man city
Grealish goal and celebration was worth £100m alone 👀
I love a good nes. Well in Jackie
I feel sorry for Norwich fans fair enough there owners don't have all the money in the world but they could atleast try and keep them up starting with a new manager who doesn't forget that defending exists
wish people would stop talking about money, at the end of the day we've spent the same as united in the last 4 years but we've won 3 titles, so now what is their excuse?
Let's be real, Norwich had a howler, city played average at best
Jesus ,a winger ....who knew ?  :D then again jesus was always good on the cross :P
Wonder Goal from Grealish on his home debut
When very bad first touch turns to be a goal to your name. I remember that happened to Drogba vs Arsenal.
I know it feels bad now Norwich fans but look on the bright side your probably going to win the championship again next season 👍
Mate Norwich coming like the local Jezzy the way they getting passed around already💀
How is grealish 100 million city were robed lmfao
Grealish may be good but he defo aint worth 100 mil salah is 10 times better
If there was one thing I DON'T like about city is how all their goals are the same and to be honest it gets kind of boring to watch.
As much as I don’t like it they won but most of the goals were horrible
Balls bounces ofd Greallish and he acts like he scored a belter.Norwich's defence was woeful
The haircut is getting stupider
Here we are again beating Norwich 5-0
Loving the all blue kit.....just how it should be with the slightly darker shirts!!!
Amazing ! Jesus was outstanding
How has this commentator not lost his job yet 😑
After this performance, Man City seemed to be doing fine without Kane...
Norwich are shocking. Gonna be the same old story for them. Out of the Championship, promoted to the Premier League and straight back down for them.
is it me or was grealish just not happy at all
Citys batty goals
Lol that fact that this is city’s first home with fans back in a year and a half and there is still a couple thousand empty seats is truly embarrassing
Fun fact: there were more Norwich fans than city fans at this game
1 billion team and they can't fill the stadium
i dont wanna hate on norwich but they are just a bit of joke in the premier league, they just seem like they are in the middle of having the ability to get promotion but not being able to avoid relegation
There should be a league just for Norwich west brom and Fulham called the yo-yo league- too good for the championship and too bad for the premier League
He lapped it up as if he scored a worldy, 100m for a lucky goal. Now thinks he's a man and fans favourite,  reality check required
How you going to celebrate that goal the way he did Jack grealish didn't have a clue about the goal it just came of him and went in. He was confused. He will be found out  to be overrated amd hyped up by the English this season
Etihad was electric today💙💙
Little boys against men.
First and the last .
Norwich take a battering every week.. just like DT's wife.
The empty seats 🤦‍♂️ for a premier league team this is just embarrassing
And that's sums up how grealish carrer will be 😂😂 ball bounced off him literally 😂😂 winning things without any contribution. And Lineker and Neville will tell us he is a winner and adds too much to the team hhhhhhhhhh
Asmr Maddy is one of the best channels on YouTube
Grealish goal eh…
What was the LB doing for the 5th goal?😂
This is gonna be a long season
You've got to feel for Norwich. I think they'll be fighting relegation again this season.
Grealish just paid back £1m from scoring that goal!  99 more goals to go! To return that transfer fee.
Oi Norwich, you got a loicense for that crap football? 😂😭
Everyone talking bout grealish scoring yet it bounces of his knee and he doesn’t even mean it lol
You lost to spurs you plicks
Norwich need tanganga so he can keep grealish in his pocket
Man shitttty are just another perversion of manure United I hate them both with all my heart and soul and hope all mancs can ferk off
Coys you cant beat us though
LETS GOOO MANCHESTER CITY PLUS JACK GREALISH
Why was Jack grealish covering his ears, was the roar of the emptyhad too much 😭
Man Norwich played soooooo bad!!!! Every single goal is the Norwich defence making big mistakes lol
Grealish didn’t know the ball was coming in
Norwich will break records this season. Especially the ones held by Derby County
Fantastic goal for the 100 million pound man... worth every penny
Grealish: “ o kicked it on mo fye”
Everyone talking about the game, meanwhile I’m staring at the size of the advertising double boards around the pitch wondering how they sync them so perfectly 😂
just put the score board up please
Problem is he plays for money bags fc so no one really cares. Shame for such a good player
Half empty on the first game , worst fans in prem history.
Not an empty seat in the house
The way Grealish celebrated... classless.
Ahhhhhh I see . . .  Republic Of Ireland Jack?
Commentary error on Laporte's goal?
Heskey 😅
were city that good ot were norwich that shite?
Back to real Man City
What an insult showing us a  pathetic no history club highlights
I’m sure someone can educate me. Jack Grealish was a £100 million transfer. Yet he was never a starting player for England? I am just a bit confused
What did I just watch
When Sterling doesn’t start City always score over 3 goals 👀
Let's be real Norwich are dreadful definitely going down this season. I know they have had the hardest first 2 games possible Liverpool and City but conceding 8 goals and not scoring one is really bad. Watch them lose to Bournemouth in the cup.
He never even kicked it lucky goal lol 😂 crealish Lol 😂
What a waste of money
atleast one good thing came out as a town fan...
wow wat a goal, never seen something like this before.
Grealish really celebrating like he even meant to score…
Come on Norwich, where are you? Let's be having you!
Norwich's defence is joke: no organisation.
Super jacky grealish
Ronaldo 90 million pounds  Greelish 100 million.   World is coming to end
Did all the city players rip off their home kit collars...
So many empty seats
Gabby jesus was on fire🔥🔥🔥
Grealish knee worth 50 million
Weldone jack from a villa fan
Two things were guaranteed today against Norwich, 5-0 and empty seats🤣
City won’t get that amount of space from the top teams but good to see Grealish score on his home debut. It was fortuitous but a goal is a goal.
That first goal was a bit Krul wasn’t it?
I feel bad for Norwich in their first 2 games they play Liverpool and City after just getting back to the prem
Ngl hearing the city fans after the 4th and 5th goal there ain’t no passion in those fans there is only like 500/55,007 real fans in that stadium
if they get Kane it will be over by  Christmas what a side
Serious question. Why do City always have empty seats?????
I think Jesus got 3 assists.
City are unreal this season. i reckon the can win the champions league if psg don't destroy the entire planet
Every time City gets beaten in a premier league game, I feel for their next opponent in the league. City thrashes them almost every occasion and it's been happening for the last 3 years! Its like waking up a sleeping lion!
how is no one talking about kyle walker 🤯
Between their seniors, U23's & U18's, Norwich conceded 16 goals this weekend... 5-0 1-0 10-0
Grealish is going to come out of the closet one day.
After last week's blip normal service resumed
Dubai City mercenaries bullying Norwich after not fancying it vs a half decent team last week 😀
Norwich are having a stinker so far
Wow expected a better goal from grealish but he’ll take it
Probably the worst defending I’ve ever seen Norwich are relegated already!
Emptiad
Norwich are so bad lol
Imagine if that was Jacks first and last goal lol
100 mill player scores by accident *clap *clap
Jesus runs in behind were a threat. Take note…
I’m very surprised with the hype about grealish, I thought he was rubbish today, many times he showed his weakness. 1- not two footed( constantly using outside of boot when crossing from the left) that led to nothing. 2- his close passing is really poor and really not their at all which is strange with the team like Man City who thrive on close passing play. 3- I believe he did well with villa but their was not really anything that proves he can be world class. We all know he’s not worth that money but I really don’t think he’s as good as made out. I put it to u this way foden is already better what does that say about grealish?
Welcome back Norwich, 6pts for everyone, no idea how this yo-yo team gets in the prem they're so poor.
Everyone for us scores tap in in their debut Aguero did Mahrez did now grealish 🐐
Mahrezs touch is underated I have to say. He has messi control.
THIS IS WHAT WE EXPECT FROM A £100 MILLION MAN, Take notes Pogba
Look at all those empty seats
What is the point in Norwich getting promoted. They sell there best players don't spend any money to strengthen improve squad barely put up a fight and mostly likely get relegated yet again.
That goal from grealish could get the Puskás Award
how many empty seats do there have to be on the first game back home in the pl after more then a year
2:50 lovely touch from Mahrez
Norwich just aren't ready for the premier league... Cantwell and Puki won't stay past another relegation either so i think when they go down this season thats the last they'll see of the prem for a good while
Proper harsh to put that down as an own goal 😂
So bad city Liverpool much better
Did the Norwich squad go out on the razz in the Haçienda last night ? Too many sloppy goals let in.
Jack Grealish completely silenced the haters with that goal. Truly a goal sent from the God's.
Those camera guys had a shocker 😂
why is the press so in love with grelish? like wtf did he actually do except accidentally score a goal
Never would have had Jesus down as a big fan of crosses
this is when yo know this league is overated norwich play like albion rovers
That was a crap goal, Jack Grealish
Last goal 😁 what a touch from mahrez. Killed it as they say
Norwich are like a Yo-yo
Grealish is still the legendary Villa Legend
2.48 look at all the empty seats XD
How are Norwich in this league
Nancy Boy scores a lucky unknown deflection. Not worth £100m.
no good putting 5 past Norwich if you can't beat Spurs.
Lucky goal Jack lad.
Cancelo was on fire 🔥
Norwich up against it. The goals look identical... low cross tap in
100M gets u player who scores accidental goals
This is what grealish is used to playing clubs like Norwich 🤣 great game and goal tho 🔥
Norwich 2 games in : -8 GD
Norwich are an embarrassment to English football
Dw villa aint missing him
I really can’t stand this commentators voice
Is Norwich a football team or what? Just asking
Grealish first goal, question is  Did he mean it? 😂 He is not worth 100 mil
City fans are so dead
Best goal from ryad mahrez waoooo what a control man
What a finish by Grealish well worth 100mil
You have to worry...norwich smashed the championship...and there getting smashed in the premier....the gap in the divisions is getting bigger and bigger
So Grealish is the big player hahaha
Mahrez simply maestro touch baller
More atmosphere at my nans funeral
Norwich are crap
What was that celebration from Grealish?   Was he channeling Alan Carr?
Norwich’s defending was utterly abysmal, ball watching, not tracking movement, the times when they tried to play offside they couldn’t have been less coordinated, shocking performance but well put away by Man City, still gotta beat what’s in front of you I suppose.
Jack grealish will be a flop, 100mil and scoring a jammy goal with no massive impact on the game. Everyone: HES THE BEST HE SCORED A VERY GOOD GOAL Me: 100mil, a jammy  goal, left his homeboy club. He better then this
grealish with a screamer
I think City missed the memo. Fans are actually allowed back in the stadium.
I’m not sure how I feel about Grealish blowing kisses after the ball bounces off his legs
Norwich did well today. They only lost 5 nil.
you mean there seasons only started now not they lost last week
I just feel sad for Norwich, First 3-0 loss now 5-0
hoping villa beat man city this season and danny ings scores like he just did to newcastle
The billionaire boys beat Norwich….. I’m shocked
"Grealish scores on his home debut. the £100 million man"  will they keep going on about how much City bought him for at the end of the season?  Grealish might be good, but £100 million is far too overpriced
Jesús was the who made it all possible
You really can’t count on Norwich- useless
Long season ahead for Norwich
Nice to see City fans still turning up dressed as seats.
Laporte, the proud Frenchman... 😂
Imagine getting a goal denial and still winning 5-0💀
I feel for Norwich, imagine facing both Liverpool and City in first two opening games
Man, those double height advertising hoardings are pretty obnoxious.
lol terrible clueless goal by Grealish. Embarrassing really.
every time they mention Jack they always say the £100m man
Grealish alredy got a goal in 3 games!
premier league relegation number 6 on the cards as a Norwich fan I accept it
And the crowd goes mild!!!!
Imagine when city play arsenal who’s think 10 ?
Honestly I belive City dont even need to splash big money on a ST, they could honestly go with Gabi, but if they really want a ST they could honeslty go with someone lower profile and still be on the top  Edit: i used honestly too much, honestly
Straight back down again Norwich
Still couldn’t sell out their Stadium when its the first game with fan in 18 months
Jesus was playing more as a winger?  Perhaps that's why he was better than usual.
Shhhhz
That was some absolutely shocking defending
me and 15 of my friends on a group chat betted a 5-0 win i hate city ⛽️ 😑
Grealish going to grab the badge then remembering its a city not villa badge 🤣
Harry who
Stick to selling mustard lol
Liverpool look better obviously biased but we are a more rounded team watch this space ynwa
£100 million and couldn't even score a tap in properly lol
Man City making Norwich City look like a bottom league table team ..... oh wait , they’re bottom league lol
Get your bets on Norwich going down now.
That's what 100 million buys you a world class strike
Poor norwich had to play liverpool and man city in the first 2 gameweeks
Nearly as good as THE mighty Glasgow Celtic ☘️
Embarrassing how they can’t even sell out there stadium
Jesus is such a useless striker they put him out wide lol. United should take note and out Martial out on the wing.
Gets man of the match against a championship team,  best player in the world now grealish 😂😂
I was at the city game and that ref was a disgrace 2nd game in and the VAR is already failing it was never a foul and when the reply happened fans went mad cant wait for the rest of season
I’m just happy grealish didn’t have to roll like a beer bottle this time around for the goal.
City have lost my respect tbh they don’t score goals in big games ;(
It’s only Norwich 😂 fair play though
City also just lost to Leicester and then Spurs, who then lost to some no name team in the conference league. It’s standard procedure from Norwich to get promoted, get hammered by everyone, then get relegated. I mean the first goal was an own goal and the second goal was a miscontrolled touch into the goal lol.
100 million to get a rebound 🤡
Honestly now Norwich need to be frozen out  of the premier league  they are pathetic club
No one going to talk about grealish not having an idea how he scored his goal 💀
Wow superb passing from walker still the best right back around
Welcome to the emptyhad Jack Grealish
Pep didnt like rhat united win pulled out the sweaty goals ha
I don't like pep or city but i have to say something that has always stood out to me is how, under pep, each and every goal is celebrated like it's the winning one. I can only imagine pep drills it into his players to strive to be the best you can be.
Why did grealish get motm?
City are by far the most hated team in the prem. Not allowed to enjoy a win against a smaller team unless you’re united it seems😂
City were good, but Norwich did themselves no favours.
The worst debut goal ever lol
Why even turn up? Beyond painful when teams just set out to prevent an embarrassing scoreline.. they won 3-2 by giving it a go a couple of seasons back and then just churn out this shower of negative 💩
100 billion pounds???
Norwich are a joke. A yoyo team not good enough for the Premier league. They should be relegated now to avoid further embarrassment.
That accicdental easy goal from grealish tho 🤣
As an Arsenal fan sometimes it's good to watch good football from other teams, City have taken our place in the top 4 smh
👍🏾
MEN CITY IS THE BEST TEAM
Yes Man City
Grealish stunner🥵
Embarassing defending from Norwich, I hope you get relegated for this. It's an insult to the premier league.  City are not that good that you can't get at least a point from them. Pathetic.
First game back for 18 months and they cant even fill their ground. Absolute embarrassment to football.
Rodri was class today still can’t believe he didn’t start the CL final
Krul is in my fpl 😭😭
It’s funny. City is like watching fifa. DDA and sweaty goals across the box 😂
SUPER JACK WE LOVE YOU 💙
The first 3 goals where the most city esce goals
Nice full stadium 🤣🤣
Don’t get me wrong, I love jack grealish and the way he plays but 100 million for him to score a tap in, na not for me
I cant help but feel like this is norwhichs master plan to win a trophie coz they win leauge 1 then get relegated from the prem and they do that every year its 200 IQ
😂😂😂 Grealish first goal so dead
Wow what a goal by Grealish. Unbelievable Jeff. ITs too much to take, quick, grab my sock.
The Norwich left back had a stinker!
Must be so boring being a Man City fan hahahahaha ckon
People will say grealish was just lucky... 😂
I thought the stadiums were aloud to be filled again guess that's why they call it the emptyhad
Not trying to Foden down at all. But is anyone a little confused as to where he’s supposed to improve this City side? This is a side that can win the league as is, and that’s without KDB. Kind of confused as to who he’s going to bench for Foden?
Nice easy win.
Happy for Jack!
City sweaty goals
No need for Kane, the bible is with them
Do Man City realise that they can have full crowds now?
How biased the English media are 😂😂 jacks goal wasn’t even the best of the bunch yet he’s the headline title
Gabriel Jesus was class today. Probably MOTM imo
There gonna win it probably
I know we were never expected to beat Man City but at least have a shot on goal for god sake. Don't mind losing but the manner of it was shocking. Same ol' mistakes.
I’m not convinced, Man U and Chelsea look the better sides.
What to take from this game.  Norwich are a championship team and crumble in the Premier league every year.  Man City did NOT need to pay £100M for Grealish
Empty seats as usual
Not a surprising result as Man City has the money to buy the most expensive and best players.  Norwich needs some decent funding to progress in the Premier league.
Loads of open spaces in the Norwich defence, even more to be found in the stands.
It's football monopoly, Abu Dhabi style.
O
The ball literally bounced off Grealish and he put his fingers in his ears🤣🤣🤣
Ermm. Have we forget the fact they played Norwich?... There defence was non existent lol.. of course they are going to smash them.. it wasnt an outstanding performance from city was it
Everyone is forgetting jesus is a winger not a striker he came as a winger
Doesn't look right in a City shirt
So many empty seats lmaoooo embarrassing
The Birmingham Beckham scores!
United fan but the Mahrez touch an finish 🙌
City tactics: run to byline, low cross into box, score
LOL they don't score much goals against best team like Liverpool  Manchester United,  Barcelona and bayern Munich This game was easy . Grealish 100 million,  he's worth 25 million
yeah Jack Grealish scored a goal he knew nothing about lol
as a norwich fan im not afraid to admit our defence was hideous today
I predicted it on discord lol
Please just relegate Norwich already.
Don't believe the haters, packed house as usual at the Etihad 💙
4 of the goals (including the disallowed) were exactly the same xD pass behind the left back (he had a nightmare), then sweaty it across the box 😐 city have been playing too much FIFA 😂
L👀k's like Norwich are going to be the whipping boys for this season....
Such a dead crowd 😭😭
Jesus 4 assists
100m for grealish for him to score a tap in that he didn’t even mean to score 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Btw it’s against Norwich oil club
All them goals was absolutely shocking
Why are city fans still social distancing?
So annoying I couldn’t find how to watch this game but good performance can always bet on city against Norwich
Norwich never fail to entertain 😂
Poor norwich down allready but will return in 2 years
wow so creative by city here. so much skill required to beat norwich. ive got to say those tap ins were amazing.
Some really good goals...and the one that hit Grealish
Jesus on the right was phenomenal, we’ve definitely missed a right footed player on that side, Sterling when playing there was amazing too.
Jack's first goal looked like an own goal, lol.
A team worth pretty much a billion beat up on Norwich well I'd have never of guessed, pointless match and Abu Dhabi FC continue to ruin football.
You know Man City are stacked when Kyle Walker turns into Kevin De Bruyne
The 100 mbillion he said lol
Emptyhad
still not worth 100 million transfer prices are getting out of control
I like grealish but noway is he worth 100mill. Not sure what city were thiking, max worth is 50mill
Well done grelish
I said to friend yesterday I would settle for a moral boosting 5 -0 defeat as they will be out for blood. 😂 2 ridiculous teams to kick the season off after a terrible preseason, I was expecting the worst and we got it. For gods sake only Leicester and Arsenal next. I hope we get to grips very quickly or this is not going to be enjoyable. But then I am clinging on to the notion it’s great having the fans back, which it is. 😂
Torres robbed
Welcome to the Premiership Norwich
City are washed
100mill tap in🤣🤣 joke of a club
“CITY ARE BACK” 😂 YOU WAS PLAYING NORWICH 🤣😂
United smash Leeds 5-1 and everyone thinks its a fluke and. We were lucky.  City smash Norwich and they're gonna own the league 😂😂🙄
100 million pound man scores an accidental goal xD
Think the commentator needs to chill out … it’s Norwich .. who’s just came to premier league .. he’s going on like it’s the World Cup 😂
Silky finish by Grealish. Pure class
shocking atmosphere
Man City is trash they just had an easy opponent
This seasons gonna be mad. So many strong teams in the pl.
Jackhammer Grealiah Looked Bette run Aston Villa kit
A ball hits you and you’re a scorer; but even worse you celebrate like you’ve scored in the UEFA finals. JG is a flop. Especially for a £100 . Footy has become a joke seriously.
The problem with Norwich is we have good players that don't care
I was there. Jesus ran his socks off the whole time and a good debut from Jack. Got a terrific reception and boy is was good to back at home 😉
Grealish didnt even mean to score
Mahrez with another sumptuous control
Norwich are always terrible, how they manage to get in the prem is beyond me
Tim Krul, highest scoring Man City goalkeeper in the 21/22 season so far.
The media making out grealish scored a world class goal ... that was a joke 🤣
Teams need to do something about that right attack of Man City
Another 5-0 game was in the championship
It’s like a single cheer when they score then just clap. What’s the opposite of limbs?
Couldn’t do that to Tottenham…
I thought sterling was gonna miss again
From a Norwich fan, please don't base our season from this 😂😂
Kyle walker WoW his passing👏👏👏👏
Norwich FC  Definition: Promoted, relegated, promoted, relegated and repeat
Yes jackkkkkkkkkkk
Well done City 👍
This year is for man United not man city
I hope this doesn’t continue throughout the season for Norwich. It’s painful seeing them fail every year. Fingers crossed they can pick themselves up again (from a Leeds fan)
What a crap first goal for greelish to score
What a goal from Grealish!! Goal of the season! Well worth 100m
Honestly what’s the point of Norwich being in this league. Already relegated after two games what a shambolic club they should not be in this league with the big boys.
GreedLish got off the ground yet?
I was there
Jesus our Lord and saviour, Amen.
Grealish didn’t even mean to score lmao, so overated
They lost against Spurs
Utterly sublime response to last weekends performance
goldbridge was right
Wow grealish scored hes still gonna be a 100m flop 😂
First and second goal flukes !!!!!!
Welcome back to the premier league 🪀🤭
I don’t know why this video was put out in Jack Grealish’s name? He’s the only player that scored a goal via a ricochet lol
I swear this commentator ALWAYS sounds as if he has a cold
Can’t believe this donut cost £100m 😂😂😂
wow!  beat norwich at home what a result to w a nk over sky sports
Norwich were abysmal.
Norwich should just take relegation just now abysmal football team
Grealish knew nothing about it to be honest. They all count I guess..
unpopular opinion but city didnt play amazingly, norwich played horribly!
Thank God I kept grealish on fpl
Nah ings thought he got the goal of the month but grealish with that worldie? He could be aiming for puskas with that goal he scored 😍
It’s Krul what’s happened to Norwich
So glad I got to go watch it,I’m currently on my way back home.CMON CITYYYY
Mahrez was offside
That touch from Mahrez omg
Add kane to the mix 😂😂
Only 4 shots on target, possibly not the best goalkeeper.
Outstanding performance!! Jesus brilliant 💙
Poor defending for 3 of the goals 2-0 would have been about right.
VAR ruins football
honestly Fred scored a better goal compared to this tap in merchant...
A tap in, well worth 100,000,000 NOT.
Grealish going on like he scored a screamer the fanny lol
Almost 10-0
Sad that the ref doesent know how to do his job and ruled off torres goal , because the goal was acc very good
Empty seats at your first home game  embarrassing. I guess oil can’t buy you everything 🤫🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
When the commentator the real Manchester City are back in town idk why it gave me goosebumps  What a game anyways
Grealish nearly missed that sitter 🤣🤣
Norwich  might go down this season
Can  not see Norwich surviving this year so poor the first two games both CITY and LIVERPOOL did not play to they best but both made Norwich look so poor .It will be a long season for Norwich
Man city first game back with the fans in nearly a year and it's still not a full capacity 😂😂
As a utd fan Jesus as a striker was great! I’m not so sure I like him on the wing 😂😂
Seriously. Norwich seem to waste a Premier League spot every other season. They don't bring anything to the PL. Parachute FC.
Grealish is still waiting to score his first goal with his foot🤣
People at work were like ‘GREALISH SCORED’ but when I saw the goal I was expecting a lot more 😂😂
£100M finish
His first goal came from a touch of life from Jesus Christ
Well Norwich are definitely going down 😂
Grealish with an absolute screamer
Terrible touch from Grealish...O Wait!! GOALL!!!
SO MANY EMPTY SEATS 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jack Grealish is overrated.
Leg go grealish
Still advertising thousands of tickets this morning after 18 months away, what a sad pointless club they are, the oil trillions is wasted on that bunch!
Yes Grealish mate! Block out the noise! Love to see it
City were good but let's all agree Norwich made it easy they were awful to watch
Honestly Norwich should not be in the Premier league just not Premier league calibiur never have been
the fact norwich are in the prem is almost laughable guaranteed 3 points for  every team playing this lot 🤣
Wow! I'm sorry to say it's only Norwich City but nevermind, don't get to excited.
The ugliest 5 goals I’ve ever seen but it’s 5-0
i dont think city fans realize this is against norwich and their best player is gilmour. dont understand why theyre getting gassed about this win, We WoN 5-0 oBvIoUsLy WeRe GoNnA bE gAsSeD
Manchester City goals look like a mistake goals. Norwich City is unlucky today
norwich just comes up and goes right back down. time for them to stay in championship and give other clubs a chance.
Grealish only scores tap ins, should of been a plumber
Oil money couldn't even fill the stadium..
Tap in fc
Grealish celebrated like he just scored with a bicycle kick. YOU AINT NO DANNY INGS.
Brilliant team, let's be honest but I think it's impossible for City to ever gain true respect.
With performances like that Jesus can break into this team!!
The Man City fans learned to chant again by the looks of things
Grealish did that celebration when he played for us in front of the Holte 😔
How many times has City beaten Norwich 5-0, does anyone know the last 5 results?
Not being funny but you were only playing Norwich
United fans - bbb buu but weve got bruno!     No1s arsed ye teams full of bums
Norwich are absolutely useless
early Puskas contender for Jack
Man city are an embarrassment. Been out the stadium over a year, won the league CL final and still cant sell more than 40k tickets
Worst debut goal to score
City will win the league.  Anyone want a bet?
Plastic fans, all they do is sit down, not even a full stadium too
Why is Grealish acting like he gets hate looool the guy was the most loved man in the country this summer
FIFA kick off on beginner.
Boring
Horrendous from Norwich
Walkers passes were filthy
Looks like the emptihad is still social distancing haha
The way commentators gas city compared to other clubs is a joke😂
Where grealish 4 assists 🤔🤔
He was pretty average considering
Jack grealish absolute fluke of a goal, he didn’t even know what to do with himself where he was stood, where as a decent football player would have would there laces through it and scored, not let it hit there knee and the flukes it into the net lmao
Grealish' goal wasnt  great, the most unconvincing finish. You could have put a lampost there and it would have scored
So 3 games they've played and they can only beat Norwich 🤣🤣🤣
Grelish will prob peg that goal down as one he won’t remember within the coming years
Norwich = 🪀
People would’ve praised grealish for touching it into the net like that for villa but now he’s at city he’s hated for scoring a “easy” goal 😂
Jack grealish's hair is more cheese string than 2020 morgz
I'm pretty sure Jack could of done this at villa too beating Norwich 5-0 villa beat Liverpool 7-2 so...
The £100 million deflection 😂
Grealish goal of the season. Hall of fame material. Surgical compared to Kane.
Jack didn't even mean to score WOW clap clap clap
no one controls the ball from a pass better than mahrez absolutely incredible skill
It was pretty much the same ball every goal, clearly had a game plan and executed it
Norwich getting relegated
Norwich in English football is like tennis one way then back the other
Look forward to seeing Norwich play Man City away again in 2023/24.
Walker was great with Jesus
3 things certain in life, death, taxes and  "the berties" putting five past Norwich  !!
Superb finish from Grealish
Jesus was on 🔥 on the wing
Nice to know Norwich still aren't good enough for the PL. That Grealish goal was trash as well, imagine that being your debut goal for a club rip
Billy Gilmour needs to put on some mass he got pushed around all over the shop today
Drunk man could of scored jack goal, oh yeah 🤔🥃
Putting this out there... I think Norwich might be relegated...
any point in norwich been in the premier league
City looking unstoppable this year, hate it
Gary Neville and souness are gonna act like grealish scored a screamer when actually the goal was a lucky deflection
Great to see the Etihad half full as usual
100m for a tap in 😂😂😂
Plenty of empty seats there 🤣
🔥
Goal of the season from grealish👏😂😂😂
5000 empty seats 😂
Grealish’s  goal of the day👍
I’m a city fan although we won! We wasn’t that impressive it’s a case of Norwich couldn’t get any worse! That back line is horrendous. Arsenal won’t be  easy.. they have beaten us before.. & more than capable of doing it again! Obviously you can only beat what team is in front of you!
Jesus was awesome today.
Really hope jesus leaves city to play consistently in the first team
Looked like Grealish tried to control it 🤦🏼
It makes you appreciate how good City are under Pep with the poor bloke only having spent the thick end of a billion...
first game back in the prem with fans for the 'champions,' still loads of empty seats? Any other team defending a title anywhere in the world would have the whole season sold out, city can't even sell out the first game back? Madness.
after all the time away from grounds and i still see empty seats, genuinely embarrassing
How on earth can anyone afford to pay jack grealish a million pound I wouldn't know its beyond me
No one:   Grealish: *Drops to his knees*
All of the goals were bad 😂
I hear that the Premier League bosses are considering an offer of £300 million from Man City for the 2021/22 trophy, to avoid them having to go through the hassle of playing another 36 matches. The other 19 teams will play 36 matches each to decide who finishes 2nd and settle the other 18 places. It makes a lot of sense and is the blueprint for future seasons.
People NEED to stop saying “ there’s no easy games in the premier league”
That was only 1 goal out of 2 games. Let’s see if Grealish does good or bad. Let me hear your opinions.
No wonder that villa fan smacked her in the head! Grealish has one of those faces to slap nate diaz style
what can i say
Cant wait for utd to thrash these blue mugs
I swear the balls walker did throughout the game were beautiful
Stirling never scores outside the 6 yard box
100 million pounds for a tap in 🤡🤡
Norwich are going straight back down
You might as well send Norwich down already
I think they should not pump city up this year.. I think they will win on luck freak goals. Own goals and trepidation from other clubs
Feel bad for Norwich already -8 goal difference and no points 😂
Why does the Bundesliga get time and scores in highlights but the English Leagues don't?
....and so it begins.
What a stunning goal from Grealish 😂😂
I remember when city played at Main Road. Before they became money bags 💸 city. They were proper PANTS
Harry who?
The Torres disallowed goal was an evil touch-and-strike man, talk about pulling the trigger 😲
Kane spotted outside Etihad banging on the door
Absolutely outSTANDING from grealish. Literally so easy for him to score it’s almost like he’s just that good 😂
Norwich were the better team for 75% of that match. 5-0 is a total injustice
What a stunner from Grealish!!!!!! 😵 the guy is incredible. First touch goal without even having to shoot😨
Nice Cross by Jesus
Norwich should just be banned from the premier league at this point, they come up just to get absolutely pumped back into the championship
I’m happy for Grealish, got so much stick for his performance vs Spurs but I think he did okay, I’m a Liverpool supporter but I find it hard not to like him, he’s humble too
Jesus and Walker had a great game
Award for most awkward celebration goes to Grealish
This was like watching a PS4 game of FIFA.
Jesus was an absolute menace this afternoon'
Jesus> Martial
Lovely stuff
Half empty stadium.
Man City needs to learn it's not all about beating the big teams like Norwich City,   but the smaller ones like  Spurs.  If they did that they would retain their title.  I mean they have the same amount of fans in their stadium like last year...
Norwich 100% getting relegated, that was abysmal
did he get four assists
Can see norwich getting relegated with least amount of points in pl history 😔
2:00 is that kyle walker? that's like the 2nd wonderful pass he's played like that.
Who predicted a 5-0 City win
Looks like a deflection from Grilish
Laporte actually no-looked 👀
Disgraceful
The goal didn’t count but am I the only one that LOVED the commentary for Torres’s disallowed goal? Everything about it sounded so satisfying
the last goal, its like norwich tried to use the offside trap haha
When u play fifa on Amateur
Couldn't even sell out their first home game with fans in 18 months, clubs a joke
Norwich are already religated in my book
he ought to be good for a 100mil
I haven't seen a performance like that from Jesus since the feeding of the 5 thousand 🙏
If City keep this up the premier league is gonna be another farmers league
Hey Graeme its not 4 assists so it’s not good enough right 😂
Things we learnt from this game. 1. £100m gets you an accidental tap in 2. Jesus is a RW 3. Man City have the worst fans in the league
city's only striker is now a winger
That's what £100 million gets you does it? Grealish will never live up to that ridiculous price tag.
Always in uniteds shadow
To be honest it was only Norwich Just look like terrible defending
More salt 🧂 in this comment section than at my local chippy !
Everyone talking about how good Jesus was haha it was Norwich get over yourselves.
Mahrez slick control before slotting into the goal was just beautiful, a proper baller of a player and one to watch out for this season. 🇩🇿☪🙏🏽❤️
its like its a sin if sky premier league highlights are more than 3 minutes or something
Still got empty seats 😂
I expect 4 goals for a 100m player
I don't get how they could've possibly ruled out that goal, that's simply not enough to count as a foul. While watching it live, I was sure they would give the goal. Anyway, Gabriel Jesus is my man of the match with his 4* assists.
If city's goals were on fifa I would have left after 2
Scores by accident and city fans say he’s worth £100million 🤭😂
Liverpool will be champions this season even if they try an buy the league as they keep doing an get Kane aswell
I see the game was sold out 😆🤣😂
What a strike from grealish 🤯
Watch Souness say that grealish played a better game than Pogba did on matchday one cuz of a jammy tap in
5 is 5 but poor defending  same as Leeds  last week
“Welcome to the empty had jack”
Some of walkers passing was brilliant
Definitely worth £100m if he can score without even trying!  Also- I thought Laporte was leaving?! Now he's dropped Stones for him completely messing up my Fantasy team!
3 things in life are certain, Death Taxes  Man city beating Norwich 5 nil
i think ferran torres is my favourite spanish player idk y. He's a baller
No one talking about walkers through balls?
I knew more about that goal than Grealish....£100m hahaha!
Jammy goal from jack relish 😂
Is no one gonna comment on the empty seats?  Ok I will, first home game of the season and empty seats on every single clip. Lol
Imagine not even being able to fill your ground on the first home game on the season…  As defending champions…  While giving a debut to your new £100 million record signing…  When fans haven’t been allowed in the ground for 18 months…   Even City’s own fans are bored of them.   Lol
People were hyping that crap tap in.😂😂😂😂😂
Wel Ben foster prediction was right.
Norwich look like they’re gonna be the whipping boys this season.
Is it weird that I kinda support both sides of Manchester?
Jesus > Pilate
This match just sums up the big difference between the championship and Premier league.  Crazy how Norwich dominated the championship but are so crap in the premier league🤣 Long season ahead for Norwich🤣
well done Norwich for running ya sock off
City was literally gifted 5 goals by Norwich, Not that impressive
Shocking defending....
Norwich left back getting caught out 3 times for the goals. Cant do that in the big leagues
didn’t expect nothing from this game we got a hard beating 🔰
100m for a nearly 30 year old that hasn’t played European football and scores 1 against norwhich 🤣🤣🤣
Everyone saying this is what Jesus should of been always doing.... this is the first time ive seen him not playing right down the middle, hes a better winger than Striker....
What a ball by Ruben Dias.  The Vision and the ability to put that kind of ball perfectly on the feet of Mahrez  is incredibly difficult to get right but he nailed it. Fair play Ruben
100m for a deflection goal, yikes
Spectacular finish from grealish
I'd be embarrassed to celebrate that goal 😕
Fans💙
Let's be honest norwich are garbage any one can look good against them
World class finish by a world class player. 😳
Some good goals but also some horrendous defending. Norwich left back that came on at half time caught napping for both the 4th and 5th goals. I know he's young, but one of the first things you learn in youth football is play to the whistle, not stand there with your hand up for offside whilst you watch your man run off and score...
What a goal from grealish it has to be goal of the day
Idc what the haters say about grealishs goal it’s his first goal city fans will take it and he will 💙 keep it going jack 👍🏼 and Jesus was outstanding today ❤️
Torres should of got his goal
This was a Norwich disaster class rather than a city masterclass
Wow, Ings has got some competition for goal of the day now from grealish's spectacular strike.😄
Jesus needs to be a winger it's clearly his best position
Remember kids play to the whistle
Grealish’s goal are best goal of the season, easily.
Where’s grealish’s 4 assists don’t we expect that from an 100 mil man
Calm down City, it was Norwich, FFS.
I don't know about you lot but I much prefer the all blue City kit as opposed to the Blue shirt + White shorts
WHAT A VICTORY I LOVE THIS TEAM💙
What a goal from Jack Grealish 👌😀
All man city do is through ball cut back goal
That was some pretty shocking defending from Norwich. They need to get more organised of they want to stay up.
Watching city is like watching prime barca back in the days. Insane team play.
Money is the difference between the two sides.
Empty seats everywhere even with 100m man on show, Not a serious club
Did Norwich pick up the defence on the way up there.
The crowd has less noise than a library
Bruh, grealish accidentally scored lol🤣
100 million player hahaha
This was a very difficult game for man city even though it was 5-0....                   More than you believe
Lol its only Norwich ya oiled up spunkbubbles
TBF I could have scored that goal
Anyone else feel bad for Tim Kruul, he really deserves a better defence!
This would have been 9-0 with KDB
That City crowd is so dead.
Etihad looking busy as usual🥴🥴
That disallowed goal wasn’t even a fowl
100 Mil and his first goal is off the knee😂
Waiting on the Irish guys video in response to his national heroe Jack Grealish 😂😂😂
when sky sports ruins match of the day
Will Norwich ever last more than a season in the PL?
Never forget last year 2020 it ended 5:0 as well lol.
City have more fans worldwide than fans that can fill that stadium.  Good win though
Don’t gas any of the City players. Tragic performance from us
Sterlings goal was literally all the goals he scored in the euros

Calm down city fans it's only Norwich
City doing what city does
Empty City seats
First home game with no restrictions in 17 months still can't fill the stadium, how embarrassing.
Don't worry blue fans united still be top after there next game 😂
City are back oh wait only Norwich City. After 2 games almost relegated with 0 pts and -8 goal diff
Kyle walker best rb in the world
Grealish has got to be a contender for goal of the season, completely overshadowing Danny Ings' overhead kick.
The left side of Norwich's defence should have their contracts terminated :D
It's only Norwich. Calm down. And don't forget to recycle your plastic. 😂😂
Overrated
City still can't fill their stadium 😂
Ings scored a better goal than Grealish, nothing special about Grealish’s goal at all.
Mahrez’s first touch is so silky
ooooooohhh myyyyy well done grealish!!! scored in a 5-0 win ooommmggg he is world class OMG 100m WAS SUCH A BARGAIN
.....wow...Arab money wins again....amazing....
Norwich are head back straight to relegation… Jesus… what a soft team. Expecting 10-0 against United. Just here to gift teams 3 points 🙈🤦🏽‍♂️
Grealish getting tips from sterling on how to finish
How is it possible to manage 5 goals and all of them ugly?
Norwich Left Back at fault for 3 goals
Brutal start to the prem for Norwich they have Leicester next loool
Still 3 points behind the leaders.
Oil fc
Mahrez controooooool 🤐
Why did Gilmour go to Norwich knew this would happen
So many empty seats at the city game
It’s a relegation team
Pep nearly gave me a heart attack after not starting Mahrez but he delivered in time to save my Fpl
lucky goal=lucky career for grealish
If City play like this all year, I'm going back to watch the NBA
Love that it’s the first game back with fans and the etihad still isn’t full, Funny that
Grealish didnt know where the ball was lmao
Honestly
Wingus is here
Someone needs to let city know they can have fans back now
Man City rule
Small oil club
Jesus found out they wanted a striker so he put on a r9 performance 😂😂
Wow that goal was worth £100 mil
Ben Foster with the Bang on prediction!
be foster predicted this outcome aswell
Hoping Grealish can keep up the good form
greanlish scored a tappin lmao
A £3.50 goal from Grealish lol 😂
Jheeeesusss took the wheel in this game.
I mean are we all surprised? 🙄
I was afraid we were gna lose due to mahrez not starting but thank god thats not the case
Norwich gonna get relegated again
You get what you pay for with grealish, a 60m player would have deflected that wide!
That magical touch by mahrez at the end and the finish top player 🔥
first goal was a tap in lol
I’m sooooo happy for Jack man!! Even tho I’m a Spurs fan lol
Play to the whistle!
What a superb finish from Jack.
I bet only 2 of city's players knew who they were when they was young
What a performance by Jesus
not to kill the mood, but this was much more norwich being diabolical than it was city playing out their skin
One of the goals of the season from the boy Grealish.
A belter from Grealish
Imagine having empty seats and your the champions
Mahrez’s first touch for his goal🤩🤩
Norwich already preparing for the championship next season...
5-0 without De Bruyne😳
Still looks like  an empty stadium 🤷‍♂️
Super Jack shutting up all you skinny muppets😂🤫
If only they weren’t an oil team that no one likes
Jesus that Puma jersey is awful
What a game by Jesus, City should play him on the wing more often
jesus is acc the replacement cf city were really looking for
What were people expecting Norwich to bloody do? This result shouldn’t be surprising
Them 2 passes from walker 🔥
Bye bye Norwich and someone take note jack gerlish scored a goal 🙀
Do Norwich fans dread promotion?
The amount of empty seats is actually a joke
Get in grealish, already putting your name in the scoresheet
@TalkNorwichCity - HMS Sink The League are now relegated already and going back down to championship next season after 2 games and 2 BIG FAT L's to their name
Home side v Away side this round 11-2 Damn
Im sorry but Norwich need to be relegated
The assist from dias for the mahrez goal 🥵 clearly been taking tips off kdb
THE EMPTY SEATS 😭😭
Jesus has always struggled with inconsistently, today he showed what he's capable of.
When you spend a near billion pounds to beat Norwich 5-0 in a empty stadium and still lose to spurs
Manchester City showing why they can win the quadruple this season unlike utd who haven’t won a trophy in 4 years    Manchester is blue 💙💙
Give grealish puskas award
empty seats, haha
You could literally bet on it ending 5-0. It always does.
Norwich are gonna get relegated *AGAIN*
jesus looked really good today
Grealish haters gone quiet
Do City fans know stadiums are allowed to be back at full capacity?
Norwich are a joke of a club, can't even beat Varchester City.......
GREEEEEEALISH
Dias and Laporte best centre back partnership in Premier league history
Norwich faced Liverpool now Man City you gotta feel for those men
Who needs Kane when they have Torres
Torres is so underrated man...
Jack Grealish showing why he is so clear off the fraud Jadon Sancho   Potential world class talent
Torres is a dangerous player 😳  really has risen, last season he was taking the first team spots and this game he was really good , this season he'll be a nightmare and possibly score a good few goals. How can u not start that player,  wish we had him !
Jesus was CLASS😍
City’s squad is crazy 👏
Most predictable result
The effect Jesus had on this game was outstanding, should play him on the wing more often
"City don't have fans" 🤡🤡
What an amazing team guardiola has built with such a small budget
That own goal was something out of FIFA lol
The champions r back! 💙
6th premier league relegation for Norwich they're a waste of time coming up everytime from the championship as champions then get annihilated
This will be the season for Jesus if he plays on the wing more mark my words
That's what you call, a city 5-0 battering,
Jesus really finding his feet out wide
norwich already relegated 😂😂
Finally that 100 million player acc did something
Glad to see City back smacking teams 5-0
City buy player for 100 mil they are ruining football   Chelsea by a player for 96 mil it’s a great signing good for them   The Man City agenda is real 🤷‍♂️
First
Why weren’t these games on tv
Grealish truly is a great signing, he made that goal seem so effortless 😂
Here they go again lol
Great to see grealish finding his feet in blue
Who else panicked that Mahrez didn’t start then ended up coming on & scoring SAVED MY FPL😂
Great performance  from  city
12th
That Grealish celebration💀
Plastic fans
Gabriel Jesus might be the best winger in the world
Nothing but an oil club
What A Finish by Grealish 100m well spent
City for life
The champions are back 🔥💙💙💙🔥🔥
And people said Norwich would stay up this year 🤣
First
