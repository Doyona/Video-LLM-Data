Hope you enjoyed LAP 3! Stay tuned in the near future for an official announcement of the FNF MUSICAL BONUS EPISODE! (No I am not producing it INSTEAD of Tabi, I am producing it ALSO because I'm not ALLOWED to release Tabi yet & don't know when I will be, and I want to give you guys at least one more FNF Video this year)
BORRA LA CUENTA
Apparently the p rank isint enough for pepino he needs a triple p rank
2:07 LITTLE BRO LOST HIS MIND
Yall notice lap one pizza face is largest over looking mc, second lap they same size, this lap our mc is the largest
Oh my god there is a actual Eevee mod in pizza tower
2:30 I just noticed that the lap counter says "1262023", 1/26/2023 is the date Pizza Tower released on Steam.  That is unironically really clever!
2:24 I’m not trapped in here with you,you’re trapped in here with me
This lives in head rent free 0:21
2:07
2:30 Mona-pizza kkkkkkk
P- peppino, what are you.....doing?

Still love the back and forth with pizza face and peppino "You lost your mind" "BUT I FOUND SOMETHING SO MUCH BETTER!"
"R.i.p lap 4, lap 5 lyrics, you will be missed."

2:30 1262023? Is that an Easter egg of when something happened in 1/26/2023?

0:21 “Reality shifting at its very core, I finished with seaconds but I still want-a more. More than Pizza Face, this-a lap is the ULTIMATE RACE!!”
I made an alternative version based on my thoughts in this LYRICS video the video it's the same only with the ghost of the real peppino trying to stop insane angry ragging crazy modding peppino to stop this modding madness by interrupting the song
"Reality is shitting at it's very core" Wise words, my friend. Wise words.
That laugh, reminds me of MX for some reason 0:59

1:20 he was like PLEASE KILL ME
2:31   Jesus Christ he’s eaten some of Vigilante and Pepperman, knocked out the noise and turned Fake Peppino into goop! All while as an Eevee…..
When I get hit and I have a P rank when they’re no enemies close
The very end is a sonic.exe reference “so little souls so little time wont you agree?” is the line
AS AN EEVEE! -a insane pizza guy 1:56
The boss becomes boss rush
2:10 OH GOD ITS GOT RABIES
HOW DID BRO COOK THIS MUCH THIS IS BEAUTIFUL DUDE KEEP IT UP :)
How you are soo good at singing this music is FIRE💥 This is the TRUE HAMMER OF JUSTICE
Unnecessarily fire 0:59
I like how he turned into Evie
Why everyone is keep away
Philippians 4:13 KJV I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. the price of sins is death, however, Jesus died on the cross for our sins, and rose on the third day, and we have to believe in our hearts that Jesus died on the cross for us! God is a loving, holy, good, merciful, and just God, but God isn’t all loving (Psalm 5:5). Jesus is the savior of the world, and Jesus always will be, the world has no opportunity to not be saved, no matter what! we should pray for our enemies, and we should be quick to forgive others, even if it is challenging. forgiving can be tricky at times, but if we forgive others, we can be forgiven of our sins. we should have trust and faith in God and Jesus, repent of our sins and turn away from any of our sins, believe the gospel, praise and worship God and Jesus, and accept God and Jesus and the Holy Spirit into our lives! Jesus will one day be back, but, God is always there, and you can talk to God at anytime, sinning is something God doesn’t like, but God is amazing, and merciful, God's grace is amazing, and he is always holy, and God always will be holy, stay safe, and have a blessed day! i spread the word on videos i watch
Fake peppino is a girl
That's a eevee
I saw the "EDD" thing and thought eddsworld
I want the Eevee pepino mod, how do I install it?
If I drink gasoline will I go vroom vroom like Peppino?

What a good day for the HUE HUE HUE HUES

What did Papino do? 0:19
the fact that PizzaFace is genuinely concerned makes me laugh
E E V E E
Every boss fight just got just got beaten up by every single character
On YT Music it says this Challeng-EDD With Lyrics
Play this at 2 speed
Why does it say challeng-EDD on youtube music when this is lap 3 of pizza tower
All of that is me when I finally snap from annoyance
"HamEeco HamEco" 🗣🗣🗣
Im here in 2025, and I forgot how much RecD can cook like this
I think bro played a bit too much pizza tower united
You know it's crazy when pizza face starts questioning peppino
Bro i wish i could turn into a Eevee
Your mine! 1:00
takin' laps to raps? pretty cheesy!
Lap 4 please
*2:27* Pizzahead: "Im so glad it was fake. " Peppino: "Are you sure about that?"  Pizzahead: "...well sh-"
2:55 Peppino as Sonic.exe
Pepino broke the fourth no tenth wall with this
@recorderdude this isnt fnf mod challeng-edd with lyrics... just helping you out with the title lmao-fellow voice impressionist

"Who arnt you people???" -fake peppino

Pizza Head: Thank cheesy goodness all o’ that poppycock was fake… Peppeevee: Is that-a so? Pizza Head: OH PHOOEY. 2:27
As an EVEEEE
Joga sage 19 weird port
If only mods could actually be combined like that
I just recently made a peppino sketch in lap 3 so this makes me really happy
Pizza Head's Nightmare 2:24
(0.00) SHOWTIME 🍕😈
Its over
2:05 GYAT😂😂😂😂😂
He should be the official voice for Peppino
"oh phooey"
How dare you,put *coffee* on a *pizza*
I completely forgot about the Sonic.exe reference at the end lol
CONIK.EXE
0:58 OH GOD I KNOW THAT HELL PLACE I HAVE SKILL USSIE HERE
its Time FOR LAP 4 do the lap 4 lunatic song
So many mods, so little time.. Wouldn't you agree.. Oh MY GOD HE TURNED INTO A CREEPYPASTA
I love that the (What did peppino so?!) seem to refer to either Giygas or Porky in Mother 3. As they are too strong/insane/uncomprehensible to understand what they did
2:03 HELP THE BUTT-
Wonder when you will do the noise laps.
oh phooey(dies)
Eevee mentioned! I adore Eevee, ask literally anyone I know.
2:30 The easter egg at the end 😮
Oh phooy

me when my mom barges in my room 2:30
2:03
0:11 yes peppino, they call you peppino.
1:22 bro stopped and took the time to suplex the cheese
Pizzafaces verse is underrated
Sans dies first. He can speedblitz Bendy, but he literally has no way to hurt the Ink Demon. It has no soul for him to target, and even if he just did physical damage to Bendy instead, Bendy's regeneration is far better than anything Sans could tear through. Cuphead, meanwhile, can actually keep up with Sans, and would quickly overwhelm him with a variety of different shots. Sans can barely dodge 26 knife swings before getting tired, no way he's dodging everything Cuphead's gonna be firing at him for too long  Now, as for Cuphead and Bendy, that one's honestly much tougher, but I’m giving it to Cuphead. He's stronger, faster, and definitely has the destructive capability to overwhelm Bendy's regeneration. And no, one random statement of Bendy's power being "infinite" doesn't automatically make him a univer level God. His actual feats don't back that up at all.   Bendy's ink would definitely mess Cuphead up, given it can drive people mad, but Cuphead is a ranged fighter, anyway, so he'd likely never even touch the ink.
Please do Lap 4
Pillar John should be the final boss he is just a chad
Would you support getting people intrested in astrocat fan game.  Im making a astrocat fan game called stella dream and you be able to make system and let time go by, if you got any idea you want tell me and have a nice day.

ONE MORE LAP TO PROVE PEPPINOS STRONGER AND WISER AND FASTER! ONE MORE LAP TO PROVE THIS LEVEL’S TOTALLY COMPLETELY MASTERED! ONE MORE FOE TO CHASE ME JUST TO MAKE EVERYTHING THAT MUCH TOUGHER ONE MORE GO TO CHASE THE THOUGHTS AWAY I COULDN’T HANDLE THAT MUCH ROUGHER  Ooohhhhh….. peppino what have you done? NEVER BEEN IN THIS MUCH PERIL  Ooohhhhh….. peppino what have you done?  Ooohhhhh….. peppino what have you done? STRESS LEVELS HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER Ooohhhhh….. peppino what have you done?  Nothing to do now but run! VISONS BLURRY FEET ARE ACHING Nothing to do now but run!  Nothing to do now but run! LEGS NUMB BUT MY HEARTS ON FIRE! Nothing to do now but run!

Peppino needs to take adhd meds
AS AN EEVEE
5:37 I love how this last part is basically yourself saying he is at the end and he is asking boyfriend to carry on his legacy ❤❤❤  Also loved the lyrical part! And herself was just heart warming ❤
2:12  there have every mod and the anime!!!
Pov:me when I'm abt to get a victory royale in fortnite
Reality's shifting at its very core
if someone made this a mod you get p+
Ah phooey- pizzahead
2:30 that oh phooey was serious
**pizzaoven has failed to run the mod**
cant wait for Absolute AbsurZiti
WHY PEEPPINO TURNED INTO EEVEE
2:31 I’m sorry. HOW MANY LAPS !?!?
Put 10 lap pizza tower show the laps
"This lap is the ULTIMATE RACE!!!!" *Peppino-constructed choir intensifies*
Of all pokemon why did peppino transform into eevee ?

Peppeevee has been born
Popping when crazy
I cant wait for lap 99999999999999999
We love mods
Perfect reference to lap 2 theme with lyrics💀🖐️😭🖐️
I like the reference to games like mario and pokemon
Now we just need Absolute AbZurti and Pasta La Vista.
Will you make a crumbling tower of pizza with lyrics
When he says he says I'm not talking to you with you you're trapped in here with me remind me of soldier from TF2 2:23
J edit:imagine this gets the top comment? Edit: this would be my first comment that gets the most likes says my haid
R4P1D
When i got pizza tower for the first time: Man i can't beat John Gutter... WAA-  When i evolved in a day: Ooh, i found much shortcuts! This is a piece of cake.  When i evolved in a week:  I got my first S! It's on a boss!  When i evolved in a month: This is a piece of cake.  When i evolved in a year: This is fair now!  When i evolved max: i got debug mode hehehe- GET OUT
I love how pizza face remembers the song in lap 2 and feels weird :)
Snick! Its him! 1:13
1:47 and 1:50  get    corr u p  t   Pizzas’
0:08 he courupet his pizza
Looks like the end was the real (unexpected - pizza tower fan song by RecD)
Bro turned into every character in the universe 💀
2:17  anyone gonna notice how the Vigilante turned into a grilled cheese sandwich??? 😂😂😂
2:25 fun fact:this isn’t a dreadful dream,because Peppino made infinite laps,every single time Pizza Face gets killed by Peppino he always restarts in his bed which means that Pizza Face can never die and will die over and over and over again…
Pizza faces part is lowkey faster than subterfuge
Nah man,instead of so little souls so little time wouldn’t you agree it’s so little mods so little time wouldn’t you agree
I love revisiting his old videos its still amazing
Бро реально стал Eevee из покемонов 😂
peak
First one is just RUNNING FOR YOUR LIFE. Second one is also running, but just because you wanted to. Third is letting a pyromaniac play with fire near gasoline.
POV me after getting a p rank and I want more of a challenge
Please do lap four🙏edit: the original lap four song is called absolute abzerzity
Peppino get mad
It actually fits
Is this ever going to be on Spotify
I love how even PizzaFace is concerned for Peppino’s mental health
we need lap 4 song
Wreck-It Ralph  0:23 reference
they called him mad, they called him insane, and finally and the most important, they called him peppino.
2:15  dayum 💀
楽しさは無限大！ よろしくお願いいたします。セガエンタープライズ
i just relised that peppino used pizza oven a program to mod ez (if there is exe.delta u gotta pacth exe.data with pizzatower.exe that is in this way C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Pizza Tower)
Can You make a lap 4 music?
Fun fact:,Yarnaby is a lion, Confirmed by "most" of the things I've seen
Lap 4 next
Is that so  Oh phooey😂  I literally died laughing😂😂😂😂😂
Not peppina 2:19
2:51 — Okay, Peppino.exe, you can stop the spoopy, it's stopped scaring me ages ago.
I like at 2:24 pizza boy says thank goodness that was just a dreem and then it isn't.
To explain, The YouTuber Nighthack wrote this song The reason it was archived is because his Channel was hacked  He was also manipulated by his friends (is what he said) to do something I won’t say This (as far as I can tell) is what got his channel removed
Brick× snickV
I been waited months for the lap 3 now i need lap 4 ( meh it dont know how it sounds with lyrics i love how sounds lap 5 instead of 4 but meh )
The  fat blur 😂
So now that there's a version 2.0 of Pillar John's Revenge, would you consider making another version of this lyric video, just with altered parts so you don't have to redo the whole thing?
Please make UNEXPECTANCYpart1-3 lyric
Others: mod pizza tower for lap 3 Me: pizza face at lap 2 for free1!11!1!
POV: me playing John gutter Vs. in every other level I where instantly die to a cheese slime 💀
This song reminds me of Pillar chase 2
End of the line, you rrrrotten hedgehog!!!
He should do PJR. V2
1:01 Pizza face really became Emienem when singing

I think, pepino has gone, insane enough to actually take the infinite lap challenge. Can somebody tell him infinite means internal, which it means until time ends, geez
I love the mona-pizza drawing
I just listened to the lap 3 🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒🕒
Did I just saw wario in My Little pony puppy there is puppy dog

2:21 female pepino reference
When four hears everyone from every object show say that 4 is THE WORST NUMBER         i screwed u didn't i
:')
pogs
This funny and great lyrics and just plain amazing
If this is cannon to the rest of the pizza tower with lyrics world, where would it take place
AS AN EEVEE.
Stolen or reused lines from lap 2
Bro made it to lap 1262023 at the end
I still have no idea how I (or any of the others who can not be compared to me) got there.
The AS AN EEVEE! Got me rolling on the floor
Goty 🙌
1:55 WHO ARENT YOY PEOPLE?!???!!!
1:00  peppion your mine
Lap 4 🎉
Lap 5
So cute peppino as a Pokémon
Bro turned into Eve that got me ballen
Oh phooey.   			famous last words
Uh 1:05
@recorderdude did you happen to start your channel on January 26 2023?
One more lab and i can win
2:03 its good that how other bosses and pizza face looks at peppino when its like the 20th lap and the whole tower is chasing peppino and modders still pass it like nothing, i love how they look confused
2:12  Wario  Pinkie pie  Pufferfish that say Augh  Peppina Ramen
i think that pizza oven is the mod manager called pizza oven
So many mods, and so little time... DONT YOU AGREE? (Peppino spaghetti)= so many souls to play with, and so little time..... dont you agree? (Sonic.exe
"The Mona-Pizza" Bro i can't XD
0:22 Wreck it Ralph reference?
Peppino your mine! You wasted far to much time to a simple jog to the exit door wait hang on havent we done this before? I dont understand whats happening now? Im feeling even stronger but how! Its like the whole world is rewritten to be oh you gotta be kidding me.. did you modded the intire game to wind up maimed i dont get you man whats going on? What about gustavo   Brick stick and john? Do you even have a single tie left? To anything else but cheating death? That itty bitty ounce of concern aside if its death you want im glad to provide! Hits hard
Me when i going lap 3 hardmode 0:31
Good time for lap 4
Now do it for lap 3 deluxe.
2:31 if you look closely, you will see a photo of “PBT3” and i’m from unexpected (the song that RecD recently posted) and I know FOR SURE PBT stands for “Pizza Boy Tower”. the game seemed to be a MASSIVE HIT, EVEN MORE than Pizzahead described it because it got a 3rd entry in the series.
W song
Lap 1 if peppino not find mushroom (first toppin) lap 2 if peppino not find Jerome's room lap 3 if peppino download mods INFINITY LAPS WHILE FIGHTING ALL OF THE BOSSES AS AN EEVEE!!!
2:21 I don’t know how to caption this
You can see both John and Pizza Faces expression they are very worried about Peppino and the Modding Madness
1:39  More i need more toppins for the perfect challenge   THE PIZZA OVEN MUST BAKE MORE!!   what more could you want?    INFINITE LAPS!! 😈  Oh no😰  WHILE FIGHTING ALL THE BOSSES!!   Pepperman : Where am I?  Vigilante : What in tarnation?  Noise : is it time to crush Peppino already?  Fake Pep : who aren't you people?!   AS AN EEVEE!!
2:27 im assuming this is how pizza head lives inside pizza face. It’s like a pocket room inside him.
Good
2:27 fun fact) Those debt papers are most likely there because Pizzahead has been taking Peppino's post.
I knew that Peppino from these infinite laps mods is TOTALLY INSANE! Now Peppino is the final boss instead of Pizza Face, lol;)
Get ready for “pillar johns revenge v2” I mean who’s here in 2025?
1:46 my honest reaction to somehow having lap 25 and still having a lap infinite WITH MORE LAPS..   also a f### load of mods
We need a lap 4
Look up fake pepino right now pepino turn into a Eevee😂
2:20 Peppine Miku
Peppino?
0:12 once in a summer camp we were doing the challenge to redo original music clip and our group was the "Gangnam Style"
Ding! Pies are done! 0:05
If you slow it down it still sounds fast
1:58 Fake peppino: he’s actually kinda cute…
This is great (despite the fact that you missed the popular demokight mod)
bro turned the mod from Lap 3 to PTUCE
2:52
2:22 IM NOT TRAPPED IN HERE WITH YOU YOU’RE TRAPPED IN HERE WITH ME(pop)
Someone should make a remix for pjr v2
0:20
i love how john ghost isnt trying to make peppino fail, he's just trying to rest, he litteraly started smiling when peppino was approaching the door
"Is that so?" Eevee said calmly whilst holding a "LAP 1262023" flag.
The image you see at 2:30 holds an easter egg. It reads 1262023 (The day: 12, The Day of the week (On M-Sun): 6 (Sat), and the year: 2023)
I'm still waiting for the music from Lap 4
Peppino really lost it
Does it laugh? Is the ultimate race?
2:02 is the best part in my opinion
I wonder what the rank is
Bruh faker's face at 1:58 is perfect 😂
rieality forming
2:28 i was bored and ran the maths and he has been lapping non stop for over 52 days
Favorite line infante laps  And so many mods
This is 50x times better then BanjixScarlet Sprunki "Gyat" song
Damn the pizza face rap
I love how it slowly gets more into *weird ahh fever dream* every loop
This is very goo—🛌
Me in lap 3 be like 0:37
Aww foey 😐
YO HE CHANGED THE AMOUNT OF ENEMIES FROM 62 TO 620💀💀
HHHHHOOOOOWWWWW WWWWWAAAAASSSSS TTTTTHHHHHEEEEE FFFFFAAAAALLLLLLLLLL
Bro I can’t- 2:28
Poepeno gone mad
And the lap 5
It took me so long to realize "the pizza oven must bake-a more" is a reference to the pizza tower mod manager, Pizza Oven!
1:00 is the best part
2:51 Peppino.exe
1:58 *turns into a damn eve* 😂
Lap 4 please
Eevee peppino is something I didn't know I wanted
I was playing this game called “superhot” and when the drums started I THREW A DISC AT THE ENEMYS HEAD!
pepeevee shinanigans
0:58 Lap 2 lyrics in lap 3! Such a good way to slip this part in!

Fun fact: 1262023 is the reference of a date (6/12/2023) this was in production in, or is the start date of the animation-making and/or lyrics recording. Correct me if I am wrong in any way.
2:30 And that was when Pizzahead knew... *_he f(taunt) up._*
no way bro has to disable comments on every video bru
You see the nose good it changes 1:01 1:05 1:11
I love how pizzaface is just fuckin concerned at this point

(AHH HAH HAH HAH!)  Peppino! You're mine! You've wasted far too much time On a simple jog to the exit door Wait, hang on... Haven't we've done this before? I don't understand what's happening now... I'm feeling even stronger, but how?! It's like the whole world is rewritten to be- Oh, yo gotta be kiddin' me... Did you mod the entire game Just to up your change to wind up maimed? I don't get you' MAN! What's going on? What about Gustavo, Brick, Stick and John? Do you even have a single tie left To anything else but cheating death? That itty bitty ounce of concern aside...

POV: You're the kid named Zachariah when there's a fire at school (Alphabetical order)
Lap 3 hard mode
1:47 OH NO👹
The brief gag of "they called me mad, insane, peppino" is just yet another way of showing Peppino is just actually insane now

Song:Pillar John's Revenge  Pillar John During The Entire Lap:Bro Just leave please
I'm now imagining how horrifying it would be if you locked up your enemy but he went crazy wanting to be the best and he just started torturing everyone from the inside.
I love how pizza face said Of Phooey 2:31  😂😂😂
2:00 1:50 0:59 0:21
Imagine if this was the dandys world the toons would defeat the twisteds and dandy and dandy wakes up and gets scared and the toons appears and dandy saw the main character twisted defeat
Pizza face: y o u v e - l o s t - y o u r - m I n d . . . . .
Lap # 1,262,023?! 🤯😨
I like the reference to pizza oven, pizza oven is a modding tool for pizza tower
1:43 pizza face: huh
The way pizzahead says "Aw phooy"😊 is perfect
2:14 YOU PICK WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoo
"is that so?" GOT ME SO HARD. plus the "LAP 1262023"
The song is fire,but the animation is CRINGE!
Where is snick
The lap counter at the end is 1262023 therefore 1/26/2023 which if I am correct was the date pizza tower came out! What a neat detail!
Lap 1262023: ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
And also pippina 2:19
1:58 yep peppino a fury
Reality's shifting at it's very core... (Continue lyrics)
Pillar John want him to leave?😅
HOW DID HE GET TO LAP 1,262,023!! WHAT WOULD BE THERE!?
HOW DID HE GET TO LAP 1,262,023!! WHAT WOULD BE THERE!?
Pepino lied by saying "one slip up and im certain to fail" becus he hit the wall and still won
Let me try a storyline.  Jayden was animating then she saw a weird black slime on here computer she thought it was a stains and tried to wipe it of and then it climbed on to here hand and then she got corrupted  Bf came because he won a Jayden contest then he saw jayden then he ran trying to get away from here he took Jaydens phone and called the oddoneout and Rebecca to come and get him they got away but they wanted to go back for her but it was to late she was already Courrpted.  That's all i got i hope you enjoyed 😅
I think Peppino’s lost it
“Oh phooey” 💀
2:30 OH PHOOEY.
“you’ve lost your mind” “BUT I’VE FOUND SOMETHING SO MUCH BETTER” FUKCIGN CRAZY
How did you get early access?
I've got pizza oven but I can't use Lap 3.
Im the 3.2 like
Waiting for pillar johns revenge with lyrics but when someone says a characters name a vine boom sound effect plays
1:58  Pepper man: weirded out The vigilante: discuss The noise: anger Fake peppino: are you fr rn 🙃 Pizza face: horrified
Peppino.EXE in the end
AHH HHA HHA HAH IM POOP
I love the fact that Peppino talks to Pizzaface (containing Pizzahead) and then encounters Pizzahead when he wakes up, implying that he was running laps all night.
J hb
Pizza tower mods pizza oven
Fact! Peppino is on lap 1262023 at the end, which is (1/26/2023) the release date of the game

One more lap to prove peppino's stronger  and wiser and faster One more lap prove this level totally, completely masterd One more foe to chase me just to make everything  that much tougher  One more go to chase the thoughts  away I couldn't handle rougher Never been in this much peril Stress levels never be higher  Vision blurry, feet are aching Legs numb but my heart's on fire! No more toppins to collect No hidden treasure, just a mad dash Countless deadly dangers in my way At long last, an even mach! Pizza face is catching up to my tail! Just one slip-up and I'm certain to fail! (AHH HAH HAH HAH!) PEPPINO! YOU'RE MINE YOU'VE WASTED FAR TOO TO MUCH TIME ON A SIMPLE JOG TO THE EXIT DOOR Wait,hang on... Haven't we done this before? I don't understand what's happening now... I'm feeling even stronger, but how?! It's like the whole world is rewritten to be- Oh, you gotta be kiddin' me... Did you mod the entire game Just to up your chances to wind up maimed? I don't get you, Man! What's going on? What about Gustavo, brick, stick and john? Do you have  a single tie left To anything else but cheating death? That itty bitty ounce of concern aside... If it's death you want, I'm glad to provide. Come at me, you hopes are zero but i'd like to see you try it I'm not here to be a hero, it's for sport  I won't deny it It's a thrill of rushin, chargin,  slidin, jumpin, droppin, tryin Knowing that one misplaced barg-in leads  to nearly-instant dyin! Every muscle at its limits Bones all on  the verge  of breaking  Body barely hanging in  At the huge beating that it's  talking  I can see the end in sight  It's beautiful, but I can't stop now! Got to bake up  something tougher  Yes, the pizza must be topped now! More... I need-a more toppins  for the perfect-a challenge... The pizza oven must-a bake-a more!!! What more could you want? INFINITE-A LAPS! Oh no. While fighting all of the bosses! Where am I? What in tarnation? Is it time to crush peppino already? Who aren't-a you people?! As an EEVEE!!!

"Oh....well.... vodka with pizza was an "unnecessary" idea....."
Can you do lap 4 with lyrics next
Peppino: oh how the tables have turned
2:31 Peppino on lap 1,262,023: Is that so?
Okay, he reminds me of Mario
Imagine peppino screws up
zippa
BRO THE 1262023TH LAP LOL
Even more crazy peppino can do is become fake peppino himself and make pizzaface pepperman
The end references a line from sonic.exe
No f*cking way, peppino!!  You use the power star to in pizza!!??  You are insane!! D:".
Eevee

2:30 "Ah phooey." Hits hard man😥
This is the definition of the lap 3 deleuxe trialer
I think peppino and fake peppino are like Superman and bizarro

Ethereal workshop but it’s so unstable you can’t understand it
The momen you enter lap 1262023 and fight Pizzahead again with 0.01 hats:

I love the pizza oven reference
You should make lap 4. I don't care how long it takes

Well congratulations, Peppino’s finally lost it! I hope you’re happy with yourselves!
Peppinos on drugs
He’s an Eevee oh shit
1:58 ... You have lost your mind...
The pizza tower might as well be The peppino pizzarea
2:30 pizzahead:just a nightmare Peppino with a lot mods: how about lap 1e+1927392-1111+b1111p3018329?

Oh Maggots... We lost Peppino's sanity.
“You’ve lost your mind” “but I’ve found something so much better” best line
egg lap mod
Wq
took a year, but the oven is a reference to the pizza oven modding thing, I'm in idiot :D
Ohh this looks cool and amazing!
I just realized Peppino was on lap 1262023 and thats the date Pizza Tower was released, January 26th 2023
0:23
Peppeevee!?!?!?! HOLY**** !!!!!!!
Let me just pause the
I didn’t see the special ingredient. It was too quick.
The end was a sonic exe refrence(the classic “so many souls to play with, so little time, wouldent you AGREE”)
Ah crap he baked the fourth wall
A really good banger
Oh thank God it was a dream oh Flippy
HOW MUCH IS THERE LAPS!!! I THINK 1632797392792731873826486872161678013729638467282546782754laps

bro pulled up the Sonic.EXE reference in the end with the "so many mods, so little time. *WOULD YOU AGREE?*"
Do the lyrics here!
Nahhh peppino beaten the lapping world record💀💀💀
Lap 1: being scared and anxious   Lap 2: realizing your power  Lap 3: abusing that power
Recd (and his team) are the only rapper that doesent mumble the lyrics
Can you do LAP 4?
The “I’m not stuck in here with you; your trapped in here with me” was amazing
This vid is my sanity rihgt now g o n e because I have the same mod
1:18 bleh, reminds me of LHPP
2:52 sonic exe reference
POV: You pop your kneecap.
Oh god the Exe quote at the end
As Albert Einstein said insanity is doing the same thing over and over expecting different results Peppino is doing exactly this
1:57 THE WAY NOISE LOOKED AT HIM MADE ME LAUGH UNCONTROLLABLY-
All the mods was kinda cool
August 12, 2036. Heat death of the universe. August 12, 2036. Heat death of the universe. August 12, 2036. Heat death of the universe. August 12, 2036. Heat death of the universe. August 12, 2036.

2:11 Pepper man: gets crushed to the wall The vigilante: turned into a cheese sandwich THE CLONE: stressed out and turns to goop *nosie f*ucking screaming from a PUFFERFISH DOING NOTHING*
Great , now were waiting for lap 4 with lyrics

AS AN EEVEE
Reality shifting at its very core, i finished with seconds but i still want-a more
wow          thats cool                         but too far bro☠
The Eevee mod reference lmao
1:55 WHO AREN'T-A YOU PEOPLE?!
Did you actually Lap 3 it
this just goes to show peppino has NO anxiety or fear he clearly just wants to get MORE than a P rank, doesn't he?? he just keeps on going, not stopping in his tracks at all
1:58 this frame, just this frame
1:19 he sounds like he is speaking korean or something
"oh phoey" famous last words
Oh my god they called him pepino
I can just imagine Gustavo during this. He's just chilling and all of a sudden, he's a Pikachu, then a cat, then a pony, etc. Must've been really confusing for him.
You know Peppino’s gone truly insane when even Pizzaface is concerned for him.
OMG i listen this song all the time
Pizzahead seems like the guy who would say "What in tarnation?"
If Pizzahead was sleeping and had a nightmare about it, who was piloting pizza face???
AF🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀
OH NO PEPPINO TURNEE INTO FURRY
Peppino.EXE is real guys And Pizzaface is Tails in this
Io is a good one too I just need
My nightmare actually came 😱 😨
0:21
Pizza face's line was just perfect
"ah phooy" famous last words from pizza face
Damn 1 year ago?
Try distasteful anchovi now :D
and it was this part of the song that defined the destiny of the pizza tower community in 2024. 2:02
Finally John got his revenge
Pizza Face: WHAT THE FUCK PEPPINO-  Peppino: WHAT?! I JUST WANT TO GET MONEY AND REVENGE!  Pizzaface: BRO WHAT REVENGE-  Peppino: YOU ALMOST BLEW UP MY RESTAURANT!  Pizzaface: IT WAS AN ACCIDENT YOU MOTHER FU-
pepino you can’t fucking cook the fabric of reality
The fact that pizzaface is completely aware of mods outside of the game is really strange to me
1:47 When I play sonic mania and summon like 50 bosses in mirage saloon
lap 1: peppino scared of pizza lap 3: pizza scared of peppino
Play it at 2x speed it’s cursed 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Pillar john: leave please Pizzaface: Are you losing sanity? Peppino: *oven bake timer noises*
I’m thinking about covering these songs but with Peppino having a New York Italian accent. Like, that one scene after the Fake Peppino jumpscare, “OH, SWEET VOIJIN MARY! I’M BOOKIN’ IT!
🙊
This lab is cool
0:08 Was that a Freakazoid reference?
"ThE cAlLeD mE mAD! iNsAnE! pEpPiNo!"
I got the song stuck in my head
Wow I like that one of the world of a Baker cook and Kitchen Crew on landbase for 12yrs local and international cruise ship as a Baker cook and Kitchen Crew on landbase for 12yrs local and international cruise ship as a Baker cook and Kitchen Crew on landbase for 12yrs local and international cruise ship as ship as a Baker cook and Kitchen Crew on landbase for 12yrs local and international cruise ship as a Baker cook and Kitchen Crew on landbase for 12yrs local and 6 6 and the one in the future and telaport back to the 480 and see if it was a good good thing to do with the Data Privacy Act of 2012 BSM Crew Service
0:31 imagine if it was "pizzaface is coming and im running really fast, if i dont make it in time, he will kick my ASS!
“1/26/2023”💀
The end XD
POV I find out you can mod pizza tower:
At this point hes the villain
WE NEED LYRICS VERSIONS OF THESE
Please do lap 4 and if you can lap5
2:02 What those guys are thinking Cheese slime: WHY IS THERE AN EEVEE Fork knight: BOI WE GONNA GET COPYRIGHTED
Yeah who needs sanity
Why is he Bald Almost💀 0:00
Like the detail that one of the mods peppino uses is warip cus pizza tower is inspired by a wario game
1:14 Why the hell sink is here
we want lap 4,v1 or v2
How about lap 4!!!!
Lap 3 is heck.
Cool. Now do lap 4 (Absolute AbsurZiti).
I love the eevee peppino (as you can tell one of my favorite pokemon is eevee :3)
Por cierto: se han dado cuenta que la vuelta por dónde va pepino la final de la canción: tienen los mismos dígitos de la ficha de estreno del vídeo? 12/06/2023

HELP- I love the eevee part
2:30 with that lap count, the game will surely crash from all the points you got
1:00 wait haven’t I heard this before..?
2:03 looks like it’s really the creators doing
Good, now do lap 4(if you want)
I love how peppino got to lap 1262023
Some people say he’s still at laps
Anyone else just realize that the thumbnail for "it's pizza time" Peppino is scared of Pizza Face, "the death I deservioli" Pizza Face is confused, and "pillar johns revenge" Pizza Face is scared of Peppino.
I actually used to own a domino's pizza and just think it's funny that there's a game that reminds me of all of the pain that I went through
2:30 oh phewy
It's only a matter of time when we get Absolute Absurziti and Pasta La Vista with lyrics
My mom and I when I'm late for school:
That one game you are hellbent on 100%ing
Ah fooey-
poor ur mouth
I love fake peppino! He's like, horrifying but adorable at the same time!
Pepino:AS AN EVEE
bro hes litaraly using the pizza oven
Are we not going to say pepperman gets taken down by wario and 1 of pepperman moves is straight out of the wario and taken down by that same move
he touched pizza face how is bruv run not over-
Solo le doi like porque se transforma en Eevee pero cuidado con las piedras agua💀
lap 4 with lyrics next

2:30 oh phooey

lap 1262023 has a secret message...   12/6/2023  december 6, 2023
0:21 After watching the memed version of this song I can't unheard Peppino saying sh**ing now
2:30 fun fact:the 1m lap stands for the relase date of the game (1/26/2023-twenty sixth of January 2023)
Something funny I noticed when revisiting this video is that Peppino’s lap count is at 1262023, referencing PT’s release date
Next lap song:lap 4 (I don’t know the song name) with lyrics ft:snick.EXE
2:22 the weird kid to his sleep paralysis demon
“aS an EVeE!!!¡¡” got me rolling 😭
2:31 I love his face
AS AN EEVEE!!! 1:56
Why an eve
Lap 1262023 Yo it has 2023 on there  That time sucked Xbox series x wasn’t a thing pc was thing Nintendo light came out some time ago in 2023

What about stick, Gustavo, Brick, and John (doesn't say brick and John in the speech bubble because there places got stolen)
"Who needs sanity when this proves  none of you can predict my moves  racing the frenetic groove quick and fierce as can be  You can chase or call it quits  You can't face me in brawn or wits Crush all records to tiny For eternity  I am not trapped in here with you You're trapped in here with me"
If u see the end thats a reference to sonic exe
2:20 peppina
1:59 bruh is a youtuber now
MY MOM SAID THAT THIS IS NOT MUSIC BUT SHES WRONG!!!
3 worse insults to be called Mad-a Insane-a Peppino If you were called any of these names, know that you're not like that at all, you are a good person and people love you.

Lap 4
Forget Pillar John! This is “Peppino’s Revenge!”
Круг трятий лучше
If taking a closer look, john ghost is mostly nerved and bothered because he has to be the one to spawn foes
Oven
Ok, when this video first came out I never said anything, but at the very end I LOVE how the amount of laps Peppino has is actually the release date of Pizza Tower (1/26/2023)
If on lap 3 peppino breaks the litteral core of reality what yhe acctual fuck could he possibly do on lap 10 ?
I like the ending
The end just SLAPS!
2:31 oh phooey
Pizzaface: I want to break you, Peppino! Peppino: *breaks and this is what happens* Pizzaface: ...oh... errors have been made.
Listen you made all the boss songs but you still have not done the final boss so please do so because i really want to make do the final boss
2:19 Peppina cameo!  So hype!
This is not Canon as; Pizza oven can only bake one mod at a time
there is one secret the 1262023 flag ,if you look at it closely it's a date it is 1/26/2023
LAP 4 please
Me when I see a rubber spider on my bed:"Thank cheesy goodness that was a fake one." My Dad with an actual spider:"Is that so?" Me:"Ah phooy."
I cant ingore the fact the bigger dots on pizza face eyes are like pupils
Lap 3
I love that the 1262023 at the end is when the game was released. 1/26/2023.
Do a lap infinity song. Make it rock. I dare you.
Lap 3 and I need more!!!!!
Speedrunner Mario vs infinite lap Peppino
I love how pizza face is just like: "You wanna talk about it, man, you alright?"
"infinite laps" ok "while fighting all of the bosses" sure why not "AS AN EEVEE" wait what?!
Wario Pinky pie Pufferfish Peppina

Me waiting for Lap 4 Lyrics: ae snick.exe hehehe
You know you’ve lost it when the bosses are questioning what the FUCK you’re doing
Lap 1262023= 1/26/2023
Pov: youtubers:
Fun fact: i actually got to talk with the creator of the eevee mod and got to ask some questions 1 on 1, he's a nice guy
Now make lap 4 to finish the list
Peppino saying one slip he wont fail 1:23 he just bumped into a wall
legend has it that Peppino ran so hard his flesh and bones all melted and fall behind. now all thats left is his Soul speeding through John Gutter Infinitely
can you do all laps with lyrics but its sings noise?
Now we need Lap 4.
Can u do lap 5
1262023 MILLION LAP BROS ABOUT 300 YEARS OLD ABOUT NOW
1:13 1:14 snick?
Famous last words: aw phooey
and bro is STILL in the gutter
Oh phooey got me dead 😂
Oh phooey
Recd made a giant mistake of initiating lap 3. We will desire more. no. WE NEED MORE.......           When lap 4
Anybody else able to sing it as fast as it is?
I like how when peppino goes to one lap it say 12/6/2023 which is dec 6 202
Funni reference 0:59 ( HAH HAH HAH HAH! PEPPINO YOU'RE MINE! YOU'VE WASTED FAR TOO MUCH  TIME ON A SIMPLE JOG TO THE EXIT DOOR WAIT, HANG ON... HAVEN'T WE DONE THIS BEFORE? I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW... I'M FEELING EVEN STRONGER, BUT HOW?! IT'S LIKE THE WHOLE WORLD IS REWRITTEN TO BE- OH, YOU GOTTA BE KIDDIN' ME... DID YOU MOD THE ENTIRE GAME JUST TO UP YOUR CHANCE TO WIND UP MAIMED? I DON'T GET YOU, MAN! WHAT'S GOING ON? WHAT ABOUT GUSTAVO, BRICK, STICK AND JOHN? DO YOU EVEN HAVE A SINGLE TIE LEFT TO ANYTHING ELSE BUT CHEATING DEATH? THAT ITTY BITTY OUNCE OF CONCERN ASIDE... IF IT'S DEATH YOU WANT, I'M GLAD TO PROVIDE.
They are not safe
Next one will be lap 4, then hopefully lap 5!
Lap 1: GET THE F**K OUT! Lap 2: Go, get outta here with that P! Lap 3: *…You’re not supposed to be here.*
Please take out the end it’s sooo annoying😤😤😤😤
i love how the so little mods quote is a refrence to sonic.exe
0:50 pizza face is catching up to my tail just one slip and im certant to fail! HAHAHAHA
OK what is up with Papino turn into an Eevee and Mario’s brother the very fat one and a pink pony and I actually don’t know the name and also a fish eating a pizza and an anime woman
1:05 reference to flinstones
Super Mario Maker in a nutshell 1:39
I LOVE Lap3 more than Lap2
I love how he made enemy count from 62 to 620 with a zero
The pizza guy is just like “LEAVE ALREADY GODDAMMIT”
Why do i feel like the guy from jt music voiced pizzaface
Do you think for lap 4 instead of pizza face chases peppino peppino chases pizza face and snick’s just working for him cuz he scared
I like the grove when pepino was a eve
LAP 4!!!!!!!!!!!
W O U L D N T Y O U A G R E E ?
All I could hear there was "reality sh*ting at its very core"
Lap 4 plis , lap 5 plis 😢
peppino head looks like and eggplant not that its bad
I think peppino got really really really  mad at that fork knight who made him lose the P rank again so he’s just taking his anger out on everyone
Pizza!
Noise"is it time to crush peppino already? " Fake peppino "WHO AREN'T YOU PEOPLE"
The beginning is pepino editing the code :0
I would definitely love to see a lyrical video from RecD about the fan made pizza tower song, “Slice Of Mayhem” by Oofator. The song is presented as “The FINAL lap”. Maybe the song could be about how Peppino meddled with reality too much, installing mod after mod and must now be faced with the ultimate challenge. The lyrics would probably reference other pizza tower lyrical covers from RecD to symbolize that things have come full circle, and this is the final journey.
Why'd he sound like alastor😂
1:17  I love how pizza face is concerned about peppino I also like how John ghosts actually wants to help peppino escape
waiting for the Final Lap
I  still can't sing it
I like the idea that peppino just gets addicted to the stress and thrill it's a very interesting way to portray the character
how YOU CAN SPEAK SO FAAST?!?!?!?!?
The fact that he bakes a pizza ex machina to mod the game is really funny, since the Pizza Tower modloader is Pizza Oven. This is also a really good way of expressing how Peppino goes from fear to confidence to insanity. However, there is one more member of the Lap Trio waiting to be heard from...    *_SNICK.EXE_*
"Oh Phooey" got me like 😂😂
!
"So Many Mods, so little time... 2odn'5 6oû âg433?"  -Peppino Spaghetti: Lap 3 Lyrics
YOU'RE TOO SLOW
if this was realistic the pizza oven would explode and delete all the mods
Well got me to look at mods and then learn you can only have one mode at a time with oven unless you know how modify code to combine mods. XD
2:29 This is actually an Easter Egg to Pizza Tower, the lap count shows us when Pizza Tower got released. 1 for January 26 for the day on January And 2023, the year when Pizza Tower came out. Amazing Easter Egg they did.
0:51 my favorite part
-You've lost your mind. -But I found something so much better!
By the way the lap 1262023 is a date 12.6.2023 12 is days 6 is month 2023 is year
Now we need lap 10 Cover
bro really said:yknow what,ima pokemon now
2:26  the mona pizza 😂😂
0:59 that laugh though 💀💀
LAP 4!
1:48 The bosses are max confusion .-.
Now I used the saying “I’m not trapped in here with you you’re trapped in here with me 🙃” all the time when I’m destroying people in PVP games.
ayup RecD you should make an lap 4 with lyrics, the video is age restricted but you can probaly find it.
Just how i want
OH NO Peppino learned to mod his reality all the bosses are dead meat
You should try to make the pizza face final boss
2:30 1/26/23
0:15 how dare you break my 4th Wall?!
Guys , we need the lyrics of this. So:I will type the first lyrics of this song and you , in the comments, will continue the song . Alright?   Reality shifting and it's very core I've finished with seconds ,  but i still want-a more More than Pizza time And the Pizza Face This is lap of THE ULTIMATE RACE!
Can we get absolute absurziti?
THE PUFFER FISH
My dude is so insane bro turned into a Pokémon
What you have done, Pizza Head, is release the worst possible thing imaginable: AN ANGRY ITALIAN!!!
Imagine if Lap 1.262.023 was a secret final lap?
The character progression from a middle aged man just trying not to have a heart attack to a Pizza Time god is great
Can you make lyrucs to this ost? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne9l-mDJmig&list=RDMM&index=26
do lap 4
Evev 😂😂😂
eevee pepino vs. pizza tower🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
0:08
2:01 I think it's funny how Peppino admits that he's insane, because he says 'who needs sanity when this proves, none of you can predict my moves'
This is the only reason I didn't walk back inside my house while it was winter waiting for the school bus at like 6 am bc it was freezing and raining,
no lap 4 ?
Pinkie pie is in this video
“Lap 1262023”💀

Thank you for that "baking the fourth wall" callout. FiW ftw.
At least peppino does not become Pizza face into pizza gal...
I love pizza heads voice
Imagine next is lap 4
Bake the wall, save the world, my final message, goodbye.
ya gotta do lap 4 and 5
Didn't lap 4 is where snick.exe is chased you
Por qué un eevee
Pepinos revenge
pizza oven
Nice vid, hope we can get Unexpectancy soon.
Peppina Ramen gain a place in the song, i love that fact. But still miss the idea of her doing a solist song
I feel bad for the topings, they must chase him for that amount of laps
Also they did this to Peppino and the fact he included the Eevee mod lol
Make an Extended one til Lap 4 - 5
Is this Sugary Spire OST? (only song)
Pepeevee is adorably insane
WE GETTING A LAP 4 MUSIC VIDEO OUT WITH THIS ONE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My gosh! I never'a seena Spartt'a remix'a lyrics
0:22
Evveeeee
Anime pepino and fake pepino are very cute!
I will always love how deranged peppino looks as an eevee. Takes me back to newgrounds levels of silliness.
I know I’m incredibly late, and also know that nobody cares about my comments. But why do I have a feeling when pepping transforms into an eeeve and fights the bosses, is it actually referencing sophist, the gaming phenomenon?
bro really loves john gutter huh?
To lap 4!!!!!
LAP4 Snick.exe
Snick.exe
LAP 4
I find it funny how the gameplay shows almost every room except for the one hard room of john gutter lap 3
this is my favorite one
who needs sanity
Am i the only one who noticed that at 2:30 it shows how many laps peppeevee has done, it is 1262023, but 1 26 2023 is when pizza tower was released on computer, january 26, 2023.
I cant believe they called him peppino
Bro we now need absolute aburzitiy
where lap 4?
The bosses confusion got me dying Edit: the way Peppino put a LITERAL POKEBALL on the pizza to become eevee is an amazing reference.
a b s o l u t e  a b s u r z i t i
They ded
now we just gotta wait for absolute absurziti where everyone fights back against peppino
Ask
Loving that this references the Pizza Oven Mod Manager in a subtle way.
Peppino Spaghetti: "I need-a more toppins for the perfect-a challenge... The pizza oven must-a bake-a MORE!!!"  Pizzaface: "What more could you want?" Peppino Spaghetti: "INFINITE-A LAPS!!!" Pizzaface: "Oh no" Peppino Spaghetti: "While fighting ALL OF THE BOSSES!" Pepperman: "Where am I???" The Vigilante: "What in tarnation?" The Noise: "Is it time to crush Peppino already?" Peppinos Paghetti: "Who aren't-a you people?!"  Peppino Spaghetti: "As an EEVEE!!!!" Pizzaface: "...You've lost your mind." Pizzaface's pause before the last comment makes for pure comedy gold
If RecD makes lyrics of Funiculi Freakout (Lap 4 theme), it should be a sequel to this.
POV: the weak kid just opened a water bottle
Pizza time sond : you run from pizza  Pillar john: pizza run from you
Pizza face his nose changes I just realized that
I want all Pizza Tower songs with lyrics BUT WITHOUT THE OUTRO FOR GOD SAKE
I love how from the bosses' perspective, they were pulled from wherever they were, to be in front of pepino, who proceeded to shout "AS AN EEVEE!", causing pizzaface who was also there for whatever reason, to be extremely concerned
peppina 2:21
banger
peppino truely have lost his sanity and empathy and hes not even human anymore
Where is LAP 4 ?
Oh phooey
But is a LAP3 IS A LAP4?
I love how peppino goes from oh no I got a to get out a to NO I NEED THE PERFECT CHALLENGE
(im not trapped in here with you, youre trapped in here with me) god I love how perfectly that works in
He went from how he acted in pizza time to THIS. This character development is a primo burg!
Can you do the music lap 4
1:40-1:58 pepeno goes insane
This sounds crazy on 2x speed.
Now do lap four! PLEASE
When the pizza isn't hot and ready
And I totally knew it
Seriously this is literally all of the mods combined
Bro thinks he’s king candy 💀 0:22
It’s funny how the fake Pepino when Pepino put the fighting all of the bosses, shaker when the fake Peppinos sees all of them he goes like who aren’t you people
“Oh Phooey”
i like the pokemon eevee
Where is our lap 4
noise should've been on peppino's side to reference the multiplayer/playable noise mods
pog
Big cinus
There should be a lap 4 song
0:04 I T ' S  A  R E A D Y
Holy shit man
did that just say the "mona-pizza"?????
2:52 bro just copied sonic.exe’s speech
“They called me mad! Insane! PEPPINO!
"who needs sanity" the words from every speed runner on a stupendously difficult game
do abloute absurziti v2 please
what can i say except delete this
My friend: hey man, what are you listening to? This song in my headphones: Me: just a podcast.
Fun fact: at 2:30 It says Lap: 1262023. Which can be turned into 1/26/2023, when Pizaa Tower was released.
Now I wait for Lap 4
How is he doing this
WARIO TIME!!!  2:12
ah phooey 😂
Lap 4 when
What does January 26, 2023 have to do with this?
2:30 Fun Fact: The Number “1262023” Is Representing The Date, Which It Means “December 6th, 2023”.  Which Means It’s Probably From The Game Awards.   I also can’t believe pizza tower still lost.       F for respect to pizza tower…
1:58 My respect to reference the Eevee mod! Patafoin made a great job at it just like you did!
Oh pooey that dog crap was-a real
That was umm Interesting th th th that I Confused a lot
incase no one saw it or knew the lap above pepinos head when he busts pizza heads door down is actually the games release date in numbers so its 1262023 and that date is January 26, 2023 the day and month pizza tower came out real good job on who ever saw before me if i'm the first person that saw that then well good job on whoever snuck that in oh and i really wanna see a snicks challenge a and b with lyrics.
1:55: WHO AREN'T-A YOU PEOPLE!?
peppino has completely lost his mind after finding the mods
If you can say pizza faces lines without speaking gibberish you are a legend
Realitys shifting at its very core.. Ive finished with seconds but i still want-a more.. More than pizza time and-a pizza face.. THIS-A LAP IS THE ULTIMATE RACE! One more lap to prove peppinos stronger and wiser and faster One more lap to prove this levels totally completely mastered One more foe to chase me just to make everything that much tougher One more go to chase the thoughts away that i couldnt handle rougher..  [John] Oh..peppino what have you done? [Never been in this much peril Stress levels never been higher] Nothing now to do but run. [Stress levels higher muscles tensing.. legs numb but my hearts on fire]  never meant to display my fury... [No more toppings to collect No hidden treasure just a mad dash] but your meddling ways have forced me. [countless dangers in my way, at long last, a even match!] PIZZA FACE IS CATCHING UP TO MY TAIL... JUST ONE SLIP UP AND IM CERTAIN TO FAIL!! [Evil le pizza laug] [Pizza Face] Peppino! Youre mine! Youve taken too much time for a simple jog to the exit door- wait hold on havent we done this before? I dont understand what's happening now- i feel even stronger but how?- its like the whole world is rewritten to be- oh youve gotta be kidding me. Did you mod the entire game just to have a chance to wind up mained? I dont get whats going on. What about Gustavo. stick brick and john? {continue if u want}
bro i love when wario apparears
I don’t know why pepino is so worried about losing his failing restaurant, he could win a gold medal in Olympic racing!
Man     LAP 3
BRO BECAME THE FINAL BOS
I know this released 4 months ago, but i cant get 2:02 onwards out of my head
Peppino is a god for "bakeing" the fourth wall.
You don't have a tall
1:58 1:58 1:58 1:58 1:58 1:59 1:59 1:59 1:59 1:59 2:00 2:01 2:01 2:01 2:01 2:01 2:02 2:02 2:02 2:02 2:04 2:04 2:05 2:05 2:05 2:05 2:05 2:06 2:06 2:06 2:06 2:06 2:07 2:07 every pizza tower player be like
Don’t forget wario
He transform into eevee and pinkie pie
I didn't expect the mods, NOR the reference to Cheese Sandwich, aka the pony Weird Al voiced in My Little Pony
Like loibu said But What about lap 999,999,999,999,999 That means U̶l̶t̶a̶ S̶̶u̶p̶e̶r̶ R̶a̶g̶e̶ t̶h̶a̶t̶ I̶s̶ U̶̶n̶̶c̶̶o̶̶n̶̶t̶̶r̶o̶t̶̶i̶b̶l̶e̶
When I saw the eevee I knew it was over
Holy cow is that Patafoin’s Eevee mod
2:30 if you concider that one single lap of john gutter is about 45 seconds, if you multiply 1262023 by 45, you get 56791035 seconds, so that means peppino has been lapping pizzaface for 946517.25 mins, which is also 15775.2875 hours, and also 657.3036458333 days and the cycle goes on, so peppino pretty much lapped pizzaface for 2 years
"AS AN EEVEE"                             -Pepinno
It’s pizza time: IMMA DIE-A the death i deservioli: I’m-a confident-a Lap 3 : I SNORTED A SUITCASE FULL OF MODS AND I’M-A STARTING TO FEEL-A THE EFFECTS HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
When he said "infant laps while fighting all the bosses as an Eevee!" He is insane!
Peppino has found the perfect way of de-stressing from his job and his (probable) PTSD...  If Pizza Tower was the cake, Lap 3 (and beyond) was the cherry on top.
I like how pizza facd said “haven’t we done this before?” It’s bc just watch the dead i desove.
bro at the end the laps are 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Pizza faces nose keeps changing lol
John treats Pepino so kindly that he doesn’t even want him to die, even though Pepino killed him
I am-a 'bout to lose-a my sanity
Why isnt this on soundvloud
Sonic exe reference at end
i love how pillar john is being really nice even though peppeno kills him over and over in each level
Lap 4 must be soon, we must have the abzurditi of the fanbase!
Lap 4 lyrics when

Oh my god the lap number at hte end is when Pizza Tower was released.

I love how this references other mods, it's like Pizza Tower was MEANT to be the best game.
Is that 2023
theres a lap 4 so please do that next recd
The definition of PTUCE:
...Peppino, i think you've gone mad with power.
You should do Pizza Mayham instremental But it's eggs lap mod final lap.
Lap 4 when
I saw this video called The ANCIENT CHEESE LAP 4 EXPERIENCE... it was equal parts funny as it was painful. how long till Peppino trys to go around a 4th time?
I love that little smile Peppino gets when he becomes an Eevee. Adorable and insane at the same time!
That was absolutely awesome.
I can’t wait for unecpctancy part 2s lyrics
All I could think of when I saw (ding pies are done) was Peter just singing "Ding, fries are done"
Guys, the amount of laps at the end is a date from this year What is it? Im thinking its the release date of pizza tower, as it was released on january 2023
2:31  Wait... Look at the lap number. 1262023 That sounds like a date Like 12/06/2023?
Peppino.exe is that you? 2:51

2:22 I love this part that it's the pizza pasta put it in the box song, simply legendary
❤❤❤🇵🇸
I realized he’s cooking pizzas to mod the game because THE MOD MANAGER FOR PIZZA TOWER IS CALLED PIZZA OVEN!  I’m going to assume that was deliberate and congratulate you.
Hi recD pls lap 4 with lyrics pls
2:12
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Peppino has gone so insane he's figured out how to change his own world
Bro used pizza oven to play lap 3
I hope they do infinate lap because peppino said he will go to the infinite lap
Lap 4 pls
2:31 Lap 1262023 looks like a date  12/6/2023 There might be something coming up
2:00 best part
pizza time: panic The death i deservioli: Confidence Pillar John´s revenge: Insanity
@markiplier Does this sound familiar, Mr. Not-A-Masochist?
12/6/23, RecD are you planning something 😮
It would have been funny if peppino says “it’s time to create my own pizza!” And just continued to play a level recd randomly found on cyop
"PEPPINO THIS IS WAR" -pizza face
0:00 beninging
I thought it was strange that pepenios rank adds up to 12/6/2023 2:30

Please, do lap 4
2:22
All you have to do is make lap 4 and you got yourself a series
My guy  baked the 4th wall like it was nothing
What type of song is that before John gutter revenge is playing? It sounds calm for some reason
i get it. peppino gets that magic pizza from PIZZA OVEN. pizza oven is mod installer for PT.  now everything is explained
That was literally the Pizza oven mod installer.
I liked the part where he turns into Pinkie Pie.
For me don’t ask 2:25
*I’m not trapped in here with you, you’re trapped in here with me*
He’s still scared to do lap 4
Time traveler: *moves a chair*  The timeline: 1:46
AS AN EVEE!
I'm not trap in here with you, you're trapped in here with me
this is a fan creation of a fan creation of a fan creation of a fan creation
I like how it's the Pizza Oven. It reminds me of the mod manager which is literally called Pizza Oven. Was that the reference?
BROO THIS IS SO HITS ON 2X SPEED!
https://youtu.be/KCjKNWf606M?si=4N5MQ7ahPViHhbso
LAB 3 I LOVE IT
i'm still waiting for lap 38108 lyrics
LAP 3 NEVER ENDS
1:55  “WHO ARENTA YOU PEOPLE?”
and stop, I realized, Pina just Pepino went crazy from constant laps, so he decided to take revenge, yes, to such an extent he was catching up that he already went crazy, to such an extent he was catching up that he already went crazy, unlike the song it's pizza time and 2 laps, there he behaved adequately and heroically in some moments, and in this song he went crazy, everything is clear thanks😮
Pizza face, wants to destroy pepino's pizzeria, WTF😡!?
secondly pepino is not a villain!😠
of course, cool music, but why is Pepino shown as a villain and pizza face, as well as peperiana vigilanti noise and fake pepino as heroes? 🤔🤔🤔🤔
𝕷𝖔𝖑
We need more john.
All the events 0:22 the Thechical world 0:42  pillar john 1:00 pizza face 1:29 another pillar john 1:43 pizzas 1:48  bosses 1:57 peppeevee 2:12 critical hits 2:24 pizzaboy 2:30 aw phooey
I'm not really getting the pufferfish mod, can someone please explain it to me?
Everyone’s talking about the stuff you are paying attention to, but is nobody gonna talk about the “Mona Pizza”
Did anyone notice pizza face's nose change toppings?
If pepino gets CYOP (created your own pizza) its over.

Lapped Rank Screen with lyrics concept.   "Look at this loser. This dumb face can't catch me. Go eat my dust. I've gotten around you all over again. Go cry to you momma because my good sir you just got lapped!"
Peppino murderer😮😮😮😮😮😮😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈
1:01 I feel like the background is spinning around
Yknow, I wish the pillar John ghost and pizzaface would chase you during lap 3, it makes “pillar johns revenge” a more fitting song name.
why peppino head like zucchini
Now all we need is the final installment, Absolute Absurziti
"baked the forth wall" good  word play (edit:) aw phoey got me laghing on thr floor
Looks like peppino's gone from hero to villain
I counted a total of six or maybe 7 mods it comes to show how crazy the pizza Tower community can mod the game
I like the reference to the mod manager pizza oven cause there is a pizza oven which peppino used to bake the mods
is it bad that i'm now craving pizza?
GOD DAM THATS ALOT OF LAPS!!!!
2:22 this part got me laughing
I watched this after watching the lap 1and 2 covers and I have to admit, lots of us did the same thing Peppino did while playing Pizza Tower. We've gone so power hungry that not even lap 3 P ranks satisfy us anymore.
This have nothing to the actual game
Pizza oven is real mods injector lol
When you forgot lap 3 is fanmade
I love how each mod was in this video nice work!
When peppino said wouldn't you agree all demonic like, it's safe to say that pizza head is toast
Baking the fourth wall is only possible with the help of Pinkie Pie, so there might be some strange pony magic involved.

Pepperman’s voice doesn’t match up at all with the one in his own video
Did you do the gameplay?
2:57 i think this words from One last round
The fact how pepino was the one who was so stressed but now it’s pizza head
We going peppinsane with this one🔥🔥🍕👨🏻‍🍳
dude i love the "Aw Phooey" it is hilarious
2:29 is that a so oh phooey
I get sophist vibes at the "AS AN EEVEE!" part
3:30 is that a so oh phooey
i accutly get it. "U know the app pizza oven right? that u use to mod in gamebannana? IT IS THE PIZZA OVEN. DOES SOMEONE GET IT?"
Will you do all boss fights and lap 4?
INF LAP 1:44
Can't wait for the Flareon Peppino mod.
Goddamn this is a wonderful tribute to not only Lap 3, but the modding community in general. The use of the Pizza Oven, the quick descent into insanity as Peppino completely loses his mind in the masochistic chaos. It really does resonate with all the people who keep looking for harder and harder challenges within games like these!
WHY IS HE A FURRY!!!?????
Waiting for absolute absurziti (lap 4) with lyric
PIZZA Tower 3
The noise be like when he sees pepino as an eviee
Okay, i do like the pizza oven reference and the fact that when peppino gains confidence, he just keeps asserting dominance and goes insane (along with those around him).
At least a 10/10 one
Peppino throughout these songs perfectly describes how pizza tower players evolve. At first their nervous to get out and have trouble with the game, then theyre confident but still cant pull off most moves correctly. Then they beat the game, get bored, install mods and become borderline insane.
Peppino is so insane even pizza face is concerned
I think Peppino has gone completely insane when he said "AS AN EEVEE!"
Is the oven in the video supposed to refer to the PizzaOven mod manager?
0:21
what does the fourth wall pizza taste like
Anyone notice that his lap count at the end is hinting to the first pizza tower lyrics song release when this lyric song released
By the time the cover of lap 4
The last line "oh phooey" i always think its awfully so i cheked outo subtitles to see what it think aperently "so" is "soul"
Ah phooey 💀
2:30 Woah. Peppino (who’s an eevee) went too crazy that the Lap count is so high that makes it look like a date for a calendar!
I like this
PEPPINA?!
Lap 4 pLS
Lap4 with lyrics
Idea: lap secret 4 or 5
i found the hidden number 2023
I like  how  pizza  head sounds like  cup head  a d mug man
I love how lap 3 isn't considered another lap, it's just peppino going for chaotic victory.
I'd be surprised if you made a cover of unexpectancy but it's pizza face trying to stop peppino who has Plans to take over the game and force them to serve him and at the end peppino dies and falls to his death like a Disney villain
Lap 4? 😅
It was a dream. Dream pepino was so powerful he escaped.
Why the heck did one of the artists made peppino very bald-
2:11
1:58 peppeevee is born
Not only did they call him mad and insane, but they also called him Peppino
OH PHOOEY!
Peppino with mods🔥
I guess you could say...Pizza Time Never Ends.
This song is my favorite song ever🎉
Alternate title: Peppino is sick of Pizza Face’s crap.
DATE IDENTIFIED: DECEMBER 6TH 2023
Now Absolute Absurziti (Lap 4)
The Pizza Face rap part is too perfect
I like how peppino legit went through legit the glitch verse
Bro is no king kandey
Bro broke the 4th wall
Pls make lap 4 lyrics I subbed :)
This is one of the best songs you made 🍕 🔥
1:56 *peppino becomes an eevee for some reason*
I can't be the only one who noticed the easter egg at the end with the number of laps Peppino ran! XD
Kind of like how this is a meta song on the nature of mods itself with Pizzaface asking what Peppino even wants anymore.
2:30 12/6/2023
I'll be waiting for December 6th.
Im going to get every Pizza Face part released and turn it into a Pizza Face Rap.
Woah
easter egg for the evee mod that cool
Okay, but can you make Absolute AbsurZiti V2 with lyrics?
this is all just speculation, but the lap number at the end of the song is lap 1262023, which has the date december 2nd, 2023.  is this just a coincidence, or is this telling that something is coming soon?
Y’all this part slaps🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 2:02
Please do one of noises lap songs including calamity anchovy
And thank you 😊
Pzzzzzźzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Do lap 4 plzzzzzzz
I like how pizzaface’s voice is in stereo
lap 4 lap 4
Here's something I actually just now figured out. When Peppino says "Is that so?", the laps he'd completed were at "1262023", which is actually the date of when the video itself was posted.  Doesn't change much, just thought it was funny. edit: i was wrong that's not true i think i just saw the 2023 part and thoUGHT IT WaS THE THING AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
NOW DO LAP 4!
PLZ Do Lap 4
Nah peppieno is not useing pizza oven hes using toppin mod loader
2:31 "lap 1262023"💀

2:30 Wait A second.....I just noticed that it says 2023 in there.....and then I had A big brain moment...that it might be saying  1/26/2023...wait January 2023 already passed, Nevermind.
................................................lap 4...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Wait, Peppino’s laps at the end of the video… 1262023 1/26/2023 Wasn’t that around the release date of pizza tower?
You know you’ve lost sanity when you said you found something better.
DO LAP 4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tj6sN5GNBPA
bro this video explains how is the ptu community edition mod (online)
i absolutely loved john's part in this song, the tune mixed with the voices and peppino singing all at the same time was beautiful
İ like the song but the animation always change.
It's funny how pizza face is actually concerned for his health
All right now do Lap 4
12/6/2023???
Peppino has gone mad
Please can you do lap 4?
its pillar johns revenge but its a rap
if i see absolute absurziti will go insane
I love how pepino says As an evve!!!! and pizza face saying you lost your mind
I love how fake Pepino says WHO-AREENT-PEPOLE at 1:55
Peppino Eevee looks so scary yet soo cute
Me when the
"so many-a mods so-a little time"   W-O-U-L-D-N-T  Y-O-U  A-G-R-E-E  "what have I done"
I love when Peppino said it's lap 3 time and lap 3d all over the place
Now do lap 4 :)
Bro infinitely killed all the bosses 2:11
2:14 Yooooo!!!
Lap1: Panic Lap2: Confidence Lap3: Madness Lap4: Insanity Lap5: S I N

I don't think anyone realized at the end we got a whole Sonic.exe reference that just makes the video so much better.
nopizzatowerlap3
2:15 THERE IT IS!
1:58 eh not enough  Faust? Faust: PINKIE TIME!
Missed opportunity to make fake peppino turn into a Pikachu

😃
I love how the vilginite says what in tarnaton
And lap 4?
I like how they used a pizza oven as a reference to the modding tool
P rank
At the end, it's says 1/26/2023
Ugh, that was NOT an Eevee! There's surely something within that suit. Perhaps an eldritch (pizza) being become anyone's comprehension, even it's own!                               Well anyways, time to crank the lever again.
I love how the bosses are all just very confused and uncomfortable
I'm not trapped in hear with you, your trapped in hear with me is the perfect way to describe the player, the game, and mods.
Pepino reached full crazyness
Of course you acknowledge the Pinkie Pie mod, but not the Toppin' Gals mod.🙄
RecD do lap -1!
Does anyone else notice that Peppino's lap number was 1262023? Is that number an Easter egg for the date, December 6, 2023, and what will be in store for that date?
It's a nice touch that, as the saga of lyrical covers featuring pizza face continues, and Peppino grows more and more manic, that the size of pizza face in the thumbnails shrinks. By the third one, the roles have totally reversed, and now Peppino towers over him.
I love this!!!!!!!!!!
1:58 *Peppevee is born*
0:04 ITS A READYYYYYYYYYYYY.
My man reached "Lap 1262023"
peppino did not lie on the 2nd lap and really went to the 3rd

Peppino thinks he's sonic.exe💀💀
Still hoping we get one for the final boss fight but this was great!
Every time pizzaface appers he raps

👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰👍
1:47  *OH NOE* 💀

Why does it sometime sound like pepino is just Katakuri singing when he eats donuts, y’know that one scene where he sings about how he loved donuts
But when will Peppino upgrade from the Pizza Oven 3000 to the Toppin Loader 9000?
Okay very cool that you do the Eevee mod when it release I love when there is wario pinkie pie and other characters

peppino what the heck?
Lap 4 lyrics ?
Make lap 4
A yo
I really want a final boss musical from Pizza Tower.
Start: 0:21
I like how they made Peppino obsessed with getting something better than a P-Rank to the point where he’s hardly sane anymore.
What was happening to pizza faces mouth and nose
Theeee eeeeeveeee mooood
HELL NAH WHY IS PP-INO GOING AROUND SPAGHETTI TOWN FOR THIRD TIME ❗️
On 2X speed it’s sounds goofy😂
Now you have to make a lap 4 cover
This is fire
Nah when this song came out I was staying at a really big house for the night and the morning I see this on my phone I’m dazzling with happiness
Next is unexpectancy 1.2 maybe 3
Lap 4 iš soo an benger
recD furret comes to the dlc on nintendo soon
2:29 it's a date dec 6 2023
Peppino has the sanity of a piece if stale bread
I kinda like the song, except when all the bosses were talking, but these videos have like 5 different art styles

Spanish :  0:50  Pisa Feiz shing@ tu maree
The problem is that I can’t really hear pillar John.
pretty cool. now lap 4 absolute absurziti v2
2:51 SONIC.exe Reference?!
you know, there is 2 more Cuphead bosses that hasn’t been made yet for lyrics
I just realized the oven peppino used to cook the lap 3 mod is a metaphor for "Pizza Oven", the tool for installing PT mods
Lap 3 I die
if you pay attention when he puts the thing to be an Eve its a poke-ball :D
also how would turning into an girl beat fake peppino unless he dies of cringe cuz he has to be the same as peppino lol
Did no one notice that when he said as an eevee he put pokeballs on the pizza
It was perfect, WAS. YOU HAD IT PERFECTLY SET UP. BUT WHY WOULD YOU RUIN IT WITH THAT “AS AN EVEE” BULLSHIT
Is poppycock a cuss word? Or what is it
Lap 4
Where was the snick challenge lap mod, where’s the woman toppings mod, where’s the multiplayer with noise alternate colours and pizzelle
How’bout a crash  b a n d i c o o t  one
If Peppino became the biggest yandere to me: 02:51
Peppino.exe
0:22 Song start

Lap 4 when
I just imagine if the song of this lap was very cool, I'm afraid to imagine how cool the song of 4 lap will be
Has anybody noticed that the numbers at 2:30 show a date which is December 6 2023 I wonder if something is releasing on that date
I really want to see more of the pizza tower songs with Lyrics
Me in pizza tower:"welp peppino is crazy to go in the lap 3-"
I have the original song saved to my music playlist and whenever it comes up, I can't help but hear "I'm not trapped in here with you; you're trapped in here with me"!
The thumbnail: poggers my dude
Did... he just quote Rorschach from the Watchman?
I like how the ghost of John the whole time is like “please… please just leave”
Is there Bye Bye There?
"so many mods litte times won't you agrre" reference of sonic exe

lap 4 pls
2:55 pizzahead sounds like the how it feels to chew five gum voice
I feel bad for pillar John
I just like to point out how Pizzaface and Peppino's places in the thumbnail slowly switched in these Pizza Tower lap theme covers.   Also, to those who want Unexpectency: it ain't happening due to copyright being a bitch.
Day 5 of asking for sonic exe with lyrics
did you know theres a vanila lap 4
2:51 RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2:24 You sure about that?
I love the way that pizza head sounds and talks I know he probably going to but I would be sad if he didn’t make and unexpectancy cover
Wow give me the so pretty good I love the really pretty good so much games to it Well I got to watch more😊
Do lap 4 then lap inf
"It pasta be this way, peppino!" - pizza face, maybe
pls billie best up :3
I love how Peppino progresses at first he’s scared and timid until he realizes he’s about to die, then going to how he’s done and getting it over with too going fully insane he’s trying to do anything he can to do as much laps as he can and pizza face starts getting concerned for Peppino
Peppino is a massive masochist
peppino going crazy with modding could be a great pizza tower mod tbh
1:39: MORE!
YOU FINALLY DID IT!! WE HAVE FINALLY WAITED FOR LAP 3!! YOU ARE THE BEST LYRICS PIZZA TOWER GUY!
Do the absolute abzurziti (lap 4)
Now its time for lap 4 :)
WHY DID U ADD MY LITTLE PONY-*dies of pony cringe*

Now do lap 4 plz
The Pufferfish and Peppina Ramen was a nice touch.

Peppino has no mustache in 1:03 Unless you pause.
0:59 this part is goes harder than me beating my keyboard when dining in lap 3 🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣🗣🗣🗣
1:45

DO THE *LAST STRAIN OF GRAIN* WITH LYRICS

Lap1000000000
Not every god damn game ost needs a god damn lyric video.
this is me while beating soulmelter EX with no healing characters: 1:19
Pizzaface made the tower into a place of torment. little did he know who's torment it would be..
2:22 I’m not trapped in here with you, you’re trapped in here with me! My fav line!
Cool! Now do the scrapped pizza time songs
“WHO ARENT-A YOU PEOPLE” GOT ME ROLLIN
I wonder who voiced pizzahead in the end of the video?
pepino went scared from brave to crazy
They called me mad…insane…PEPPINO! Well your name is Peppino.
1:56 *casually turns into Eevee* Congratulations! Your Peppino has evolved into an Eevee!
Pls do leaning nightmare with lyrics next
How do you this?
“But I found something so much better!” Has the same energy as “I reject my humanity, Jojo!”
2:57 me: Pizza head you are done  Pizza head what have i done....
Do tubular trash zone
I like that pizzahead says "oh phooey" In the end, which not only adds on to his cartoony character style, but expresses it quite well
2:57 best post-credits scene i've ever seen
I noticed the lap score in 2:29, it either says 12/6/2023 or why I thought it was 1/26/2023 when January ended a while ago.
lap 1: I GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE lap 2: I GOTTA GET THE HIGHEST RANK! lap 3: I HAVE TO MAKE A VIGILANTE GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH WITH 19  MODS
oh my god i just finally got the joke. He baked the pizza in the pizza oven. Pizza oven.  the modding application.
Can someone make your reposted the wrong peppino fake peppino or noise and use this songs please
how come when the pillar john spawner talks over peppino only then peppino talks about the intense suffering from overworking his body
Hey RECD hay otro pijama MAIMYMAYO
Pizzahead voice is AMAZING! ITS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT IN EVERY WAY
I am waiting for the pepperman bossfight! (Just take your time with the one you really want to do)
IVE STOPPED WATCHUNG WAITING FOR TABI AND FULL FNF IMPOSTWR V4 AND WHERES FNF!?!??!!??!?!?!?!?!?

1:28 litteraly portays Peppino almost DYING
Хотелось бы так же на русском... Жаль конечно такого не будет, это же надо тратиться на озвучкера и искать идеальный голос и переписывать текст(
Do lap 4 now
Why is pizza faces nose changing between toppings tho-
Peppino's 3rd Time Around Spaghetti Town
blud is gonna make snicks challenge
Call me crazy, but Peppino's lap count at the end reads 1,262,023. But if you put it as a date you get, December 6, 2023. Now what could it mean?
*"Limit?..... I've got your limit..... RIGHT HERE"*
This, Pizzaface, is what happens when you drive an Italian to his limits.  With his newfound power, Peppino will make sure that Pizza Time will never, ever, ever end.  Kore ga... REQUIEM... da.
How is pepino in the games code? My pov: peppino how are you controlling the world?!
It doesn’t matter is pizza face gets stronger, Pepino is faster
Recd is the perfect Peppino voice
Make lap 4 song
Anyone noticed the music is slower
after this what pizza tower song will you do next? calzonification,unexpectancy,crumbling tower of pizza,the lobby music or any of the level songs?
Why is no one talking about how the vigilante was turned into a grilled cheese sandwich?
AYO Peppino Pies are ready!
I guess I never thought about how the enemy’s in pizza tower react to how I mod the game, like could you imagine being literally any enemy and expecting pepino and instead get the noise or an eevee or pepino’s non canonical sister
Это не перевод Злого Монаха, расходимся, пацаны
Do Pepperman strikes
Pizza face song
I love how even pillar Jhon sying to Peppino: "Ohhhh... Pepino, the ends in sight! Go... Finish and set things right! Im so tired of spawning baddies..." Feels like it already became a routine for him and he even happy that Peppino is leaving, and clearly a little tired of his job, at stopping him, and then he turns to: "Wait, you missed the door, don't you wanna be free?" Its really hits hard, plus he looks even scared by the an unexpected turn of events. It's a perfect song and i want to listen to it again and again, good job! I also in love with that part when Peppino became completely mad and turnes into eeve and pizza face went from: "Wahaha im the boss, you cant win" To "Oh fuck, you lost your mind" And looks clearly scared.  And the Peppino's  "Who need sanity when this proves none of you can predict my moves" Just hits hard. Its just amazing, and i want to say again that im happy about pillar Jhon part it's just great.  And the final:  "I'm not trapped here with you, you trapped here with me" Just a great finish line, and just look at Pizza face's face. Oh god it's a true horror.  Bro is dropped a fire song abt pizza tower and thought we wouldn't notice!
More pizza tower or more Friday night funkin
Peppino's actual VOICE?
2:22 me with the principle at
Turn on subtitles at 0:55 and youtube decides to mock peppino
Looks like Papino really liked the Eevee mod
can lap 4 pleas rec'd I'm a big fan
Mid. 1/10 ☹️
I love the idea that peppino himself is modding the game
Peppino went nuts
pov:a boss has lap 2 in pizza tower
Character Growth:  Lap 2 video: Peppino messed up the descent outside the Pillar John room Lap 3: Peppino cleanly descends that same room
dont you agry what have i done
2:02 is quite literally the best part because it drops so hard It’s stuck in my head
RecD, you should make a lap 4 song lyric one😃
they let him cook so hard he baked the fourth wall
1: The ending that referencing on Sonic.EXE is PERFECTLY placed 2: I really hope you will do Lap 4 with lyrics where Snick.EXE is gonna punish Peppino (idk why i thought it like that lol)
Now make lap -1  Peppino modifies reality so much that the world stars collapsing and he's sent to lap -1
I just realized the ‘1262023’ is like the Pizza Tower release date! (January 26, 2023)
Im really hoping to see gustavo more
Remember old days of fnaf and everything else like roblox
Here's hoping for sugary spire at some point
Pepperman, Vigilante and Noise: Why the actual fk are we here?! Fake Pep: *WHO AREN'T YOU PEOPLE* Vigilante: That ain't the point pal... Fake Pep: (confused clone screaming)
Pizza head ain't geting out of this one
So many pizzas and so little time WOULDLNT YOU AGREE
Who aren't-a you people!
Who else got that Freakazoid reference
Suffering to get by then suffering to p rank now using mods to make it easier because it's to easy
This reminds me of that comic where fake peppino fucks mr stick
0:22

After the music  Peppino: phew... *Laughs* that-a was alot-a fun... *Inhales and exhales* Well, time-a to disable the mods! *Disables* but at least i have-a lap 3 pizza wich is-a better than nothing... Wait! I have an idea! What if... I DO LAP 3 WITHOUT-A MODS?! no mod around to help this-a time! Its-a gonna be a race between me and-a Pizza Face! Get-a ready mr pizza... Peppino is-a ready for Lap 3 Round-a two! *Enters the Lap 3 portal*
1262023... Anyone else notice that or am i just over thinking it?
LAP 4? :)
either it was a design choice or peppino was breaking the game so badly he continuously turned into different art styles.
Peppino finally decided to give up at one million, two hundred sixty-two thousand, twenty-three laps.

So no one is gonna talk about in the end, Peppino is in lap "1262023" Does this mean December 26 2023?
I love how before going in the Lap 3 portal Peppino picks up a floating 0 and changes "Pizza Face Time" to "0 min". This video just breaks the fourth wall completely
Poor pepperman and the vigilante for their short lines
Peppino saying I'm not trapped here with you you're trapped in here with me *while holding a pizza cutter*

"They called-a me mad-a... Insane-a.... P E P P I N O"
they called me MAD... INSANE...   ...PEPPINO!!!!
2:29 "is that-a so?"  he said...     well... it isnt so gustavo boutta go pikachu mode on lap 4's silly thing
“AS AN EEVEE!!!” Is perfect idk why.
?  1:56
So when's Tabi coming out?
Pov you get A+s in all of your classes
Peppenio time to go nuts
Pizza face make you revenge
did you notice pizzas face’s nose changeing?
john spawns around 25 baddies in a single lap, so by multiplying 25 spawned baddies by 1262023 laps we got  31 million 550 575K spawned baddies. I feel bad for John
Oh my god the eevee mod brought back SO many memories for me.
Ta bueno
I love how peppino went from scared at lap 1, to brave at lap 2 and crazy at lap 3(INFINITE LAPS? LIKE JESUS CHRIST RELAX BRO 3 LAPS IS ENOUGH)
You can't get 1 Million subscribers
2:56 why isn’t no body talking about this Peppino became into Lord X lol-
I EFFING LOVE THE ART AT 2:03
me be like
We have seen Peppino's sanity gradually rot away as these videos go along
How has nobody talked about how pepperman and vigilante had their voices revealed?
Was the part at the beginning with Peppino adjusting the code supposed to be a reference to Wreck it Ralph? It looks similar to that part where the king was swimming through the void full of blocks of code idk how to explain it
man it sucks you can't have multiple mods at once...
Pepperman: Where am I? The Vigilante: What in tarnation? Noise: Is it time to crush Peppino already? Fake Peppino: *WHO ARENT-A YOU PEOPLE?!* Edit: This actually proves how insane Peppino’s limits go. Meme 2: Pizzaface: Did you mod the game? Peppino: It might seem crazy what I’m boutta say..
Can you do don’t make a sound
I love how, even when Peppino is at his best, when he's mastered EVERYTHING, he still doesn't clobber Fake Peppino. He escapes.
TIME FOR LAP 4
Please do the lap 4 ❤
Lap 1: Peppino with anxiety, Pizza Face with power - Lap 3: Peppino with power, Pizza Face with anxiety
Lol the fist video was lego
Never let Peppino cook 💀
Now you would need the one from lap 4 (Absolute AbsurZiti) edit: The final it's a referencie to a dialogue of Sonic.exe
lap -1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRKPEG-lLC0  lap 3 but all of them avenge https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzGvEzoA9a0
You could hire me for lap 3 gameplay I saw the timer go down
1262023
You didn’t have to do pizza face like that
Ever think “wow this is too slow” use 2x speed!
Pls do unexpectancy
1:58
Pepino is an Eevee now
Here's pizzaface spiting bars 0:59
Good job doing lap 3! Now do lap 4.
Bruh lap three was hard in John gutter
I love how the joke about the magical pizza oven is that the mod manager for pizza tower is called pizza oven
2:02
This is like me when I’m playing gorrilla tag and I’m peppino
Lap 4
Can you make "strike a taunt" with lyrics even as a short
1:00 I love this part so much and idk why ._.
Either he didn’t show peppino beating up fake peppino or I just didn’t see him
Pizza tower Mod fusions be like:
1:00, 1:57  😶‍🌫?
Lap one infinite lap, coming right up
Please do the final boss and crumbling tower of pizza next
2:02 , the best moment
And the... LAP 4?!
Peppino is slowly becoming the new Chara.
Its incredible how pizza face magically can change his nose to different toppins
Peppino took "never let them know your next move" very seriously
WhErE iS lAp 4?
LEP5
So I did the math on how long it would take a player to reach the final lap count when Pepeevee busts into Pizzahead's room with 1262023 laps. For this I'm using my best times at John Gutter (since that's the level all the lap songs takes place in) by only grabbing Toppins that were in my way and nothing else. I'm also using how long it would take to complete subsequent laps by subtracting my best single lap time to my best non-P Rank lap 2 time. My best single lap time (not grabbing everything) is 1:36 My best non P-Rank lap 2 time is 2:26 Subtracting those 2 gives us 50 seconds for a completed second lap. Give or take a few seconds depending on any flub ups, but for the sake of the equations lets just go with 50 seconds for every lap after entering the portal. 50 x 1262021 (subtracting the first two laps since this is adding onto that time) gives us 63101050 seconds. Dividing that by 60 (cause 60 seconds in a minute) gives 1051684 minutes give or take a few milliseconds Dividng that by 60 again (cause 60 seconds in an hour) gives 17528 and some change hours Dividng that by 24 (24 hours in a day) gives 730 and some change days. Dividing that by 365 (365 days in a year) gives us 2 years. 2 years of non-stop gameplay with little to no mistakes, at least for me, I honestly couldn't be bothered to see what the current world records for John Gutter single lap and P-Rank were.
Took me 2 weeks but at the end  When peppino says “is that so”  The lap he was on  1262023 Is when pizza tower came out  January 26 2023  It took me a bit less then 2 weeks to realize that
Pizza tower boo(b) or boo reference 2:24
bro baked da fourth-a wall... da wrong fourth-a wall... da topin gall mod
Bro thinks he’s king candy💀
I love how Pizzaface is just concerned for Peppino a this point.
I like how pizza face was so confused about what was happening
1:00  Pizza face's nose keeps changing
Can You do lap 4 and 5 pls
Oh gpt what have u done
0:09 Why was there a cherries on Papino‘s teeth
2:55 I want a sonic exe game based off of pizza tower now
0:11 that’s your name
Lyrics I'm now the this is my favorite video😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎!!!
Bro he came with the mods ain no way
1262023 laps is insane
I also like how peppino just goes reckless for 100k+ laps
I don't use pizza oven i use xdeltapatcher
ooh i get it  "pizza oven" ahaha
bro shit if you watch past the outro it does a sonic.exe reference
I Like the voice of jhon
(Please be lap4)
Ok
reality is shifting at its very core
Can you do funiculi holiday next?
“Infinite laps!” Ok but that’s a lot- “All the bosses!” Peppino calm down- “AS AN EEVEE!” OOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHH!!!! 🤯🤯🤯
the lap number at the end is 1262023 something is happening on december
Bro it’s at 1million likes,you know what to do
A man consumed by his desire for a challenge, taking all those around him down the pit of lust for pain with him.
Peppino can beat Goku in terms of speed
I didn’t know this until a friend who plays Pizza Tower daily told me this, but Peppino using that oven to mod the game is a reference to the Mod Manager “Pizza Oven”
oh god how far deep are we going to go or is this the limit
yes this happened to me
But in lyrics
I wanna know how if is the lap, 4
Eevee Peppino
When lap 4 (absolute absurziti
Peppino didn't lie when he said was insane
peppino : WaNt SuFfRiNNiG? ill GiVe YOU SUFFFERING!!   pizzaface/pizzahead: PEPPINO!! STOP YOU LOST YOUR MIND!!  peppino: ITS TIME FOR LAP 4!!!!!
WHO ARENTA YOU [PEOPLE
Insanyti
do sugary spire insted
We just need the final level which is the top of the pizza tower I cannot believe how insane it will be if it happens
One thing I don't people notice is how each thumbnail of the 3 laps Peppino became more "mad, insane, PEPPINO" Pizza Time He was terrified and scared of everything, Death that I deserve He was getting atticted to get a P Rank, and finally this, He's just gone mad with mods.
I’d like to not how desperate he was for the comfort of his friends, but now he’s completely ditched them
Pepper man song pls so underrated
the lap 4 song but with fake peppino getting more and more concerned
Bro lap 3 but You got L rank lol
0:50 I love this part😂😂😂
Wait a minute... something seems off about that lap counter near the end... almost like it isn't just a lap count, but a date... 12/6/2023 perhaps? Maybe a hint of something yet to come?
Ok so if you look at the laps that pepvee is holding you can see it say 1262023 1/26/2023
who is that pink horse
Make unexpectancy with lyrics
Man this thing in x1.25 speed hits different
Somebody gotta do a mod like this, like, lap 3 and then you go to lap 4 and it's this savage thing, an eevee, infinite laps, and fighting all the bosses, and in the rank screen you assault pizza head.
The fact that pizza head has the mona-pizza is very very fitting
“Lap 1262023” i love how its the release date of pizza tower
Do lap 4 next
FINALLY! A new song! This is FIRE!
Kirby pizza tower name run Kirby RUN!!
PLEASE DO A BYE BYE THERE SONG WITH LYRICS
"thank cheesy godness all of that poppycock was fake..." "Is that so? >:)"   *"hahah, man im dead :)"*
0:20 this is where it starts...
We need unexpectancy with lyrics
I can't hear jonn
Pizza face's part is the best

So many mods  So little time   W O U L D  Y O U  A G R E E
Is time lap 4

Here who wants recd to do unexpectancy lyrics!
Congrats, You created the worst kind of Pepino... one where his PTSD is suppressed by his shear hunger for a powerful drug...  its called  A D R E N A L I N E  Maybe the Repainted mod might break him (a.K.a "Piss Towel" [Yes, that's the actual name; don't question it, its just what I consider "MEME HELL/PURGATORY" {There is a nice Pizza Time remake of it though; give it a lissen} ] )
how to sing it
LAP4?
1:58 Peppeevee is born

BAKING THE FOURTH WALL

1:00 we making it out of the pizza place in this one🔥🔥🔥🔥💯🥶    Edit: 0:57 the subtitles just roasted him💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Make unexpectancy next
Peppino has really lost it now
Starting with a freakazoid reference was genious!
2:30 wait a minute THIS IS A DATE
the amount of mod references in this video is hilarious lmao
It's exciting to see how the mods are now being more and more part of the actual game!
Me done lap: Ω
Its funny how in after the kinda ending with recd he pizza head says "what have i done" as if he didnt know making peppino fight a fake version of himself a past rival a outlaw and a sentient giant pepper wouldent make anyone go insane
good video
Me MoDs
Lap 4
I love how peppino was scared then brave and then insane
lap 1 filled with anxiety lap 2 filled with confidence lap 3 filled with insanity lap 4 snick hell
XD even pizzaface is concerned
"aw phooey" I love how we finally hear Pizza Head's voice, and it has the effects of an old-timey rubberhose character!   Uh-Oh... Peppino looks like he's possessed by some deviant variation of the SPEED DEMON.
Congratulations on this getting 1 million views! 🎉
You featured the lap 3 mod the Wario skin mod the Eevee skin mod the pinkie pie skin mod and the peppina skin mod
2:30 fun fact: the numbers are saying the day where pizza tower was finally released, if you already know already.
What
Yes
How does this not include the Toppin Gals
It's a shame what with another growing fandom suppressed because of yet more media conglomerate bs. I'm glad we got this but I'm guessing this will be the last PT video? Unless you do other fan-mixes I don't see it being worth the legal unsteady ground.  Love it as someone who's got 2 levels left on Lap 3 this is great. I love how the songs go from panic to confidence to madness.
*Pizza boy* I’m Dead💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀🥖
It’s funny when you put Wario😂😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Pokémon EV!💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
LAP 3💀
I like to think that the reason why the thing peppino uses the mod the game is a pizza oven is because of the popular pizza tower modding software that is "PizzaOven"
im not trapped in here with you your trapped in here with me is my friend group in a nutshell
No play this song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmMPKqn4PbI&list=PLHnRvGc5_NL52AAG5LoZzIIFUgW5X1N4h&index=50
you this actually makes all the sense. why? well if you remember in TDTID (the death that i deservioli) peppino said he could stay for lap 3. and he did.
2:50                   uh oh
TRICKY WITH LYRICS PLS!!
This is better than any lyric I’ve ever seen
Lap 4 do it plz peppino wont have fun he will suffer
1:50 bro my phone got a notification,that was perfect timing
It's perfect for it to be the pizza oven that makes the mods, because that's what the Pizza Tower mod manager is called
blud thinks he king candy💀
Dont tell him about lap 4 and snick
When I heard the “so many mods, so little time” part and then pizzahead saying “ what have I done” I went like “you turned him into lord x”
damn peppino took laping to a whole another level no wonder people vall him crazy he almost crazier than jevil!
Lap 4 please
the boss's were just minding their own buisness then they got beaten up by peppino or wario, pinkey pie, a puffer fish, and peppina
Pizza Face luring Peppino to the tower just to mess with him. Peppino summoning Pizza Face to the now playground of levels just to mess with him.  Ah yes... Everything has become full yum circle...  And it is *DELICIOUS*
I have no idea how i missed this for a week but it is very cool and unique
do the crumbling tower of pizza.
Lap 4: 💀
I like how pizza face actually gets concerned about peppino
LAP 4....
cant wait to see what happens in lap 4 XD
Just realised the lap at the end might be a date
Peppino is a certified psychopath!
Pls make pizza time the death i deservoli an pillar john revenge in spanish
Peppino made things a little more cheesy around here!
Youre not chasing me  I M  C H A S I N G  Y O U
2:02 best part
Looks like we are gonna need a lap 4
Pt youtubers be like:
I think it is should glitch a bit because of the first line  like 30 seconds? Of the song
0:23 bro thinks he is king candy
2:51 You Made Peppino.EXE!
Peppive is just perfect.
will there be a fnf musical season 2 with some more random modes with lyrics?
At this point, Peppino's going to do crumbling tower of pizza in reverse and back again. The sheer amount of speed, momentum, and insanity from John Gutter makes the tower start crumbling and Peppino has to speedrun the whole tower to reach the top, and then run down again.
It should be pepinos revenge
"i have baked the fourth wall!"
Does the sweat of the pizza face look like onions or is it just me?
One must imagine Peppino happy
Bye Bye There next?
2:30 now heres something weird with the numbers 1262023 i looks like the date 12/6/2023 so does that mean we are going to get something on that day???
Ok cool song now make a pepperman cover
"Oh Phoeey" the last words of pizza boy/head
Holy shit, I was not expecting the Pinkie Pie mod reference. Excellent cover, so glad I found this channel!
1:13 Who could that be? Boy I wonder... That purple guy looks familiar....
Wait what would happen if I ate the (4th wall) pizza thingy what would happen
Nobody: Literally nobody:            Pizza head: what have I done.
I love the fact that when all of the bosses spawn in, their main concern isn't to take peppino down, but instead it's what on earth is happening. Then fake peppino comes in with the "WHO AREN'T-A YOU PEOPLE!?" At maximum volume. That scene is beautiful.
what happend to peppino? he's acting crazy,
I just realized the part at the start is probably a reference to pizza oven (the main pizza tower mod manager)
I love how it’s a reference to all the PT mode, Lap 3 itself, Infinite laps, eevee for heck’s sake, my little pony reskin, I don’t know what the oufferfish one is called, and I love the fact he doesn’t even care, pepino just cares about lapping it
Am I The Only One Who Realized That The Lap Peppino Is In Reads Out The Date 12/06/2023?
Pls lap 4 lyrcis?
(next video) unexpectancy lyrics
2:17 grilled vigilante sandwich
lap 1262023? what does that number represent, the year is 2023 but whats 12 and 6 its not december nor is it january
Lap 4 next
2:02 This part is FIRE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hey RecD, I'm an old subscriber, I would also like in the not too distant future if you could publish or create lyrics for the unexpected song or the lap 4 song, it would be incredible if you do so, please take it into account :)
Nah it’s peppino.exe
Is it time to crush peppnoio already got me 😂
Do the crumbling tower of pizza
I'm just now realizing the joke is that pizza oven is used for pizza tower mods lol
Hey Recd, can you give me rhis image without the lyrics? I'm planning on making a cover called "Fraud and Flawed" where one of my OCs that are based off him fight him trying to get him back to his senses. Peppino calks him a fraud and My OC says he still has some flaws (or ranks left unchecked like the T or P+ rank) which leads to the fight.
keep it up dude!
Love that so many mods were represented in this music video.
Great job! *now do lap 4*
Peppino Has Reached Lap 1.26Million
It would be cool if pizza tower had a workshop on steam
I sung the whole song, I'm out of breath 😭
Oh phoowe
2:31 OH MY GOSH THE LAP NUMBER IS SUPPOSED TO BE PIZZA TOWER'S RELEASE DATE. HOW DID I NOT SEE THAT
If you didn't realize at the end of the song the lap said 1262023 which had 2023 in it
now lap 4
I didn't know about this
I mean pizza face
Pls make final batle bs pizza time
Do you know the lap counter at the end it says 1262023 it the real ease date of pizza tower 1/26/2023
Please lap 4 with lyrics
I love that Peppino goes so insane with pushing himself that they reference the Eevee mod.
I'm Russian LOL
me afterhitting my sis and my mom is mad:
He's nervous at first, confident after, then breaks the god damn game after            Makes sense.
I'd Love If you'd do Unexpectancy part 1,2, and 3!
0:31
I like the song my Favorite
When a fan made song becomes official mod and a song 😮
now do lap 4 fanmade lyrics where peppino had enough and pizzaface and peppino basically switched places
We do not care 💨 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🤏🤸🤸🌚🌚🌬️🧜🧜🧜🧜
i love how pizza face is kind of scared for peppino's sanity, he is slightly worried for the pizza man he trapped inside his tower.
Peppino when he broke into PizzaHead's room:  Y O U R  L I F E  H A S  B E E N  F O R E F E I T  S O H A N D  O V E R  Y O U R  S O U L
Broh has 1000 mods💀
Is this a separate character from the Peppino in make some noise and pizza time never ends?
please PLEASE make lyrics for the song "unexpectancy" or "bye bye there" that would be epic
Lap 4 *SNICK.EXE INCLUDED*
bro why did peppino turned soo many mods that you can play as
Now time for you do lap 4
Can you make strike a taunt with lyrics
And the sonic.exe refrence at the end was so funny
“I’m not trapped in here with you your trapped in here with me.” Got me laughing
But what about popping as a eevee😢😢
DID BRO JUST TURN VIGILANTE INTO GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH?????????? can i eat it?
2:20 fake sister?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉
recd do lap 4 with lyrics next pls
*after 2 million laps peopino unlocks mach 12*
Pillar Johns’ revenge? More like Peppino’s revenge
I feel like Fake Peppino would chase After Peppino Eevee Just to pet him.
In my opinion, I think I predicted the future
peppino went from a pizza man who is in debt   to basicly a man who has lost all sanity
1:34 WHEN DID THIS GUY HAVE ARMS
the way how peppino stare at all of them looking crazy is funny
The final lap number is 1262023 or 1/26/2023 but I have no clue on what it means (2:30)  Edit: Its the release date for pizza tower
finally good artists
Me trying to figure out what the hell was even said 😅
Whaaaaa
THIS SONG IS FIRE🔥🔥🔥🔥
Pls why can't you make unexpectedly boss fight
Has no one else noticed the lap number at the end says 1/26/2023 , which is when pizza tower was released?
Pizza head thought it was a nightmare so many mods so many laps wouldn't you agree also keep up the amazing work I loved every song you made and all are bangers
average pizza tower mod experience
Certain To Fail! (AH HA HA HA)
DO UNEXPENTANCY PT.3

1:56 obligatory peppeevee timestamp
Masterpeace
2:31  oh phooey
Play this at 2 times the speed and he raps at the speed of light
When Peppino says the pizza oven must cook more, he’s referring to the mod manager 😂
IS IT TIME TO CRUSH PEPPINO ALREADY?
IS IT TIME TO CRUSH PEPPINO ALREADY
IS IT TIME TI CRUSH PEPPINO ALREADY?
0:57
Someone do the lyrics to sing it xd
FINALLY YOU DID IT!!!
PEPPPER MAnN VEGAlATE (hope I said it right ) VOICE REAVEAL
POKEMON IS PEPPNO!!!
lap 1,262,023,peppino has truly lost his mind. But you can't break what's broken, right?
“If It’s Death You Want, I’m Glad To Provide 🗿“ -Pizza Face
Pizza face knows that he just modded the game a little bit too much which means pizzaface going to get tired
THE PIZZA SPEED DEMON HAS POSSESSED PEPPINO! EVERYBODY RUN!!!

Funny to see how they even put eevee's mod on the musical lol.
Glad he dont know about pa- ah forgor
Wow How this is so good??
2:17 PUFFERFISH?
MODS
*As an Eevee.*
have I ever told you the definition of insanity is?
Peppino turned into Sonic.exe right at the end there
2 things. now we know the other bosses voices and also I think you should make a short of just johns voice alone cause you can't hear him at all
Pipino
“Peppino has gone far beyond the depths of his sanity. It falls to Pizzaface and the others to end his reign of insanity before the universe falls to ruin.”
LAP 3
😐 ?
Props to you for drawing the most physically deranged eevee I’ve ever seen in or outside of Pokémon art.
that one random tas speedrunner
I just noticed this. But why did Pizza faces nose change over and over again? 1:00
2:30 idk why i think thats a date about a video like 12/6/2023
Rorschach: "I'm not locked in here with you, YOU'RE LOCKED IN HERE WITH ME!!!!"
Game modders be like:
We want the final boss music lyrics not this ):<  (Good video btw)
"As an Eevee!" holds far more power than it has an right to
2:30 Ah my god Peppino went to Lap 1262023 (Wait, 126 2023?)
At the end pizzahead says what have I done to him
Pepperman says where the hell I'm I?
Nice use of an old-timey filter for Pizza Head
"oh foey"  the best way to end this song!
How can I start Lap 3?
At first I thought it would deal with peppinos lap 2 not being enough for a p
Wait a minute listen to pizza heads voice it sounds like an old radio, is that foreshadowing ?
Make it until all the way to lap six
Now do lap 4
Do unexpectancy with lyrics
Modding games is just too much fun.  Edit: Also, damn. I think these mods are like crack to Peppino.
1:14 possibly the *GRANDest* pause ever.    *GRAND JOHN! FLEENTSTONES?! Auughhh... Grand John. Grand John?! What the* **taunt sfx**
after I watched this video, I'm starting to think peppinos gonna get hit hard by karma for his reckless modding-based behaviour in the next pizza tower lyrics video.
We have mod to pt that replaces 4 songs (your songs (p rank, pizza time, lap 2, pizza time never ends) that means they will add lap 3? For pizza oven users ofc
Lap 1 is filled with adrenaline. Lap 2 is filled with mild confidence. Lap 3 is filled with craziness. Lap 4 is filled with speediness. Lap 5 is filled with skill. Lap 6 is filled with confusion. Lap 7 is filled with madness. Lap 8-10 is filled with confidence. Lap 12 is filled with remembering.

Referencias preciadas memes peepeeve wario es perfecto
Man, it's music it's VERY COOL
Colaboration pleas
Peppino got to far
Omg they referenced the eevee mod xD
MAKE MORE OF THESE PLEASEEEE
Tbh peppino should have been more panicked
did this bitch just bake a quantum pizza? that's not theoretically possible.
eevee moment 1:56 to the  2:12
Peppino seems to love John Gutter
OH, I GET THE JOKE, THE MODDING ENGINE FOR PIZZA TOWER IS CALLED PIZZA OVEN, AND PEPPINO IS INSTALLING MODS WITH A PIZZA OVEN
Cool
Now waiting for Absolute Absurzity
My favorite part of this is: 1:49
*player eevee has joined to game*
I love how he used pizza oven to get mods (pizza oven is a mod manager btw)
for more information on this device is not available
this is the only time peppino feels confidence and craziness instead of stress and anxiety. and the fact he said "Im-a not a trapped in here with you, you're trapped in here with me." proves how insane Peppino really is.
WHO AREN'T-A YOU PEOPLE??
I GET IT, HES USING PIZZA OVEN LMAO
Hey can you do lap 4?
Cool
i think lap 1262023 was some date i think it's 12/6/2023
now you need to do the last official lap ost , The Lap 4 (Absolute AbsurZiti)
Pls Lap 4!!!
can you make a lap pi song with lyrics?
Peppino has no sanity
Bro it's all of the mods
Next can you do unexpectencey
Banger
B R I C K J O H N Snick:Is That Supposed To A Roast? Gerome:.........................E A Sports To The Game
But why is he a Eevee?
1:30 i like how john ghost tells peppino to get out to be free but peppino just ignores it
Just a little longer... (Lets do the thing where the comments sing the songs)
All of these mods happened because of a single HACKING PIZZA OVEN AND THE THIRD LAP!
I love to, think that this is the very same Peppino, who not too long ago was running all around one stage, sweating over one unfound topping. And niw he's bending the reality angainst himself, just for the thrill.
We need a lap 4
2:51 sonic .exe reference
The thing that Peppino says after the End Screen and in the Credits Is a Reference of Sonic.exe
2:24 rip pizza head
ohhh it’s because pizza towers mod manager is called “pizza oven”
It would be a shame if I gave you some more dairy peppino (if you heard the let's make some noise song you know what I'm talking about 🗿☕️
🗿🏃🍕
Im sorry this guy didn’t brake the fourth wall he broke the 5th wall
Peppino literally turned into Peppino.exe at the end
I love how concerned pizzaface got
1:58 oh I was not expecting that.  And to be an Honest im with pizza face he really did lost his mind.
lap 4 with lyis now
People called him mad for doing this, denies it, then he goes mad in the end. Hehe, ironic
Wait a second. Am I the only one who noticed the date on the lap # above peppino on the last frame?   1262023 = 12/6/23
YES YEAH BABY YES LAP 3 BABY YES
NEW ENEMY!!!  PizzaPog - 1% chance of appearing in replacement of Pizzaface. If it appears, it will instantly catch you after about 3 seconds.   Also, I noticed that Pizzaface's toppings change frequently between 1:00 and 1:18 . Such a detail.
Can i just say Pappina Ramen lookin' kinda cute ngl
I just realised the oven references Pizza Oven Mod Loader You guys are maniacs
do lap 4
THIS IS LIT
Could have used pissino in this song... But AAAYYY THE SONG IS A BANGER FOR ME MATE
1:45 players when they start using mods be like:
at least has satiated......right?...no one tell him about lap 4
peppino.exe lore?
1:13 you said brick but there is a picture of snick, and you said John instead of Jerome.
I like how instead of beating fake pappino up he turns him into an anime girl
Peppino Eevee has the unique property of evolving into Italeon
Okay at least pepino can understand my adhd because after getting bored you wanna do things more crazy and faster and it drives you crazy to perfect it
💌💗💖💔❤️‍🩹
I just realized something... The lap counter says 1262023 and since This Year is 2023  That means this is a Secret Date number It can't be 1/26/2023 since we passed January which means The date is 12/6/2023 which means Something is going to be coming out on that date Or maybe I'm thinking way to deep into this
1:17 my favrote part
Insanity
The pizza oven refrence was smart
1:59 I found something so much-a better! Amazing art-a!!!
bro just modded his life with pizza
Well looks like we got Peppino.EXE now so I wonder how Sonic.EXE feels about that? Since Peppino stole his line but anyways that was a pretty good video and also I like how you add the mod characters in it that was pretty good video I really like it keep up the good work RecD
He want the heat risk
what happens in 12/6/2023
This ain’t even a P rank anymore, bro got the entire alphabet
OH SH-
I've memorised all the lap songs with lyrics, this one shouldn't be too hard... right?
Me when I play tag with my friends:
1262026th lap now, keep going!
Make the snick challenge cover. It'll be cool.
lap 4 pls
lap 4 with lyrics
I'm pretty sure this is the first "With Lyrics" that has peppino modding the game. (Also, i'm the 4,700th comment! Yay!)
Peppino become a furry he gone very mad pov the anit furrys:oh no the furry power IS OVER 9 thousand
I love how he chose to be an eevee of all things
Lol all the mods in one
Why hello there Plume!
1:57 is the funniest part hands down
pepperman's battle with lyrics
Fake peppino has been so isolated for soooooooo long that he doesn't know the other bosses? Holy shi-
stupid theory: Peppino's lap number when busting into Pizzahead's bedroom is 1262023, which could be 12/6/2023 (the only way it makes sense, as the other two valid dates are in the past, and there is no RecD video on those dates). Is a surprise due for December 6? Perhaps it's the FNF musical mentioned in the pinned comment?
All right time to make a pizza face and yellow slime dude and pepper man
Someone more Seen the face of Fake peppino seeing peppino turning into a eevee?
Most sane pizza tower player
WHERE IS TABI?!?
Lap 4 is going to be Peppino chacing Pizza face
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm5YMHSyMCs
I get it now the pizza oven is the mod manager
That mother 3 reference with "What did peppino do?!" Though
Make lap infinity Next
Pizzaface: "If you do not do my bidding, I will destroy your little shop! That is, of course, unless you can defeat my...pizza...toooower...uh?" Peppino: *salivating. eyes red. arms twitching* Pizzaface: "all of them. i have made every mistake all at once."
Finally!
I love how Pizza Face, a man just as deranged as Peppino, is shocked and confused at his desicions, being the logical one.
ditasteful anchovi but let the noise talk
I’m gonna need to see golf 2 with lyrics
Wario,Pinkie And PufferFish
LES GOOOOO
sugar rush?🤨
The laps of the final means something?? (the number is 1262023)
Made Blue Licorice! From Pizzano espace Sugary Spire Bet It Will Be Populat
Truly shows how chaotic all the mods are for this game lol.
Fun fact: That "1262023" Stands for January 26, 2023, which is the day that pizza tower was released
0:08 "they called me mad. insane. PEPPINO!" yes, they did call you peppino.
I love Peppino's charachter development from first video.Anxius for survive->Challange->Making it hard because its so easy
I sure do love lap 1262023
I was caught so off gaurd when he used the eevee mod
wow rolaso
PIZZAHEAD FLIPPIN' DIES
2:30 *oh phooey*
I LOVE THIS LYRICS VIDEO
ah phooey
Lap 1: pepino is scared Lap 2: pepino isn't too scared Lap 3: pepino JUST WANTS MORE
Nice Freakazoid reference
Whoa it's a so cool
GOD i love how you included the mods
The lap number was a date Something will happen this december 12th
Evee peppi
Oh my god the eevee peppino art tho
PizzaHead: Oh, pan my pizzas, what a nightmare! Thank cheesy goodness all that poppycock was fake... Eevee Peppino: (Lap 1262023) Is that so? PizzaHead: Oh, phooey...
“Brick”💀 “John”💀 1:13
imagine a song where peppino finds ptu or ptt that would be insain
1262023 LAPS, DID YOU STAY UP 50 HOURS FOR THAT MANY LAPS, HOW THE HELL!?!?!??!?!?!
Bro has too much mods
you cannoli run so far
why was pizza face nose changing
gud. now lap 4          its a joke but that would be funny if you did lap 4
Good
I want the crumbling tower of pizza
This is the ultimate modded crossover😅
WE NEED LAP 4

Get a Courrouption mod and try to make lyrics with it

"One more foe to chase me just to make everything that much tougher, One more go to chase the thoughts away i couldn't handle rougher."  "(Ohh.. Peppino what have you done, Nothing to do now but run.) Never been in this much peril, stress levels never been higher, vision blurry, feet are aching, legs numb but my heart's on fire!"

" I don't understand, what's happening now, I'm feeling even stronger but how? it's like the whole world is rewritten to be!  Oh, you gotta be kidding me."  "Did you mod the entire game just to up your chance to wind up maimed? I don't get you man what's going on? What about Gustavo, Brick, Stick and  john? Do you even have a single tie left to anything else but cheating death? With a itty-bitty care of consern aside,  If it's death you want I'm glad to provide."
EASTER EGG TIME:  The final lap sign peppino is holding is actually the release date of the game typed out in American formatting, 1/26/2023 or January 26th 2023. I love all these details that the artists put in.
Where plants vs zombie
A perfect representation of the pizza tower community, thank you.
Finally, Pizza Face made the monster we all hoped Peppino to be.  Also, that "Aw Phooey" at the end was literally perfect.
I have depression.
goofy ahh
"hmm 2 laps not good i make lap three" "hmm 3 lap not good i make infinite lap" "hmm infinite lap not good i fight all bosses" "hmm fight all boss and infinite lap not good i become eevee"
Even Pizzaface is concerned
2x
Woah :O
WE MAKING IT OUT THE GUTTERS WITH THIS ONE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I like how he had the pizza oven, the name of the pizza tower mod loader is pizza oven so I wonder if that was on purpose.
Oh phooey
Has anyone noticed that every non gameplay Sean has a different art style
now is lap3!
Oh my God the gods have answered
P+
Peppino I'm so tired of spawning baddies 💀
Just wait till he hears the lap 4 music its a banger song
Aww phooy, Famous last words
lap four please
2:30 Eevee Peppino’s lap number is the date Pizza Tower released
Lap 12620223 theme, 30 Minutes & The Pizza’s Free.
ah yes, getting a lap higher then one million be like:
idk but on the final wen it shows all laps that peppino has made it says 12 - 6  - 2023  what could be.
I love your pizza Tower songs please make more
can you do lap 4?
pizza tower united community edition be like:
when I first saw the lap 2 Pepino said should I stay for lap 3 and then I asked for it and look at here. We are now.…                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               SHOULD I STAY FOR RAP 4
He has most definitely lost his mind
Finely music🤑🤑🤑
Lap 4 ?
Play the entire song at 2x speed, everyone is eminem 0:21
Just a little longer...  Comment what the next sentence is cuz why not?
We making a p rank with this
cant wait for him to do Absolute Absurziti
Remember when pizzaface was the villan?
will you do lap 4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzF2a233GRU&t=5s
Am I the only one who thinks peppinos "so many mods so little time wouldn't you agree" supposed to be like sonic.exe "so many souls so little time wouldn't you agree"
WTF HOW YOU ADDED LAP 3
"What more could you want?!" PizzaFace not even a second later: *I shouldn't have said that. I should NOT. Have said that.*
the idea of pizza tower mods being freshly made pizzas are pretty cool
Lap January 26th, 2023.  I fount that out before I knew pizza tower came out by that time
to sasify peppno  i kinda want a mod with alot of ranks and you can collect all of them like ____ rank free one topping kill almost no enemys and score worst then d rank [if you get hit you get in - points if you have zero in this mod] so ya it would be fun and good to  torcher yourself with
I love the way Pizzahead talks it feels reminiscent of how characters talk in the Cuphead Show
Lap 3
ohh the pizza oven modding app I get it
4 lap now
2:03 i love this part
I’m not sure if I’m the only person who’s done this but try listening to this song at 1.5 speed
2:27 (insert Unexpectancy part 2 here)
1:56  "AS AN EEVEE" bro that surprised me lol
Cant wait for lap 4 (no fr lap 4 exists now...)
I JUST REALIZED THIS! Did you know about the pizza face just completely stopping when in a secret location like secret 3 and made that for the pizza oven? If so then that’s AMAZING details
oh fooey
blud found mods
2:52 soo many mods to play, soo little time wouldn't you agree?
I like how pizza face worries for Peppino but still has no trouble killing him
Literally the panic in pizza head’s voice when he says “Aw phooey” Somebody help him ;-;
9/10
now do lap 420
I like that there is a variable that is just peppino:yes
I didn’t even notice his changing the variables
just asking, why is pizzahead's voice like a 80's radio announcer
lap 473 with lyrics when!!1!111111!1?
Now we just need to release the pepperman song
laps are the new last breath phases.
DO PIZZA TOWER VIDEOS MORE OFTEN
I mean what did they expect would happen when they attacked an already cracked in the head individual like peppino
Speed Strength  Wisdom Mods- wait what?
Ooo
just reminding, the lap peppino was at at the very end was 1262023 or 12/6/2023 which is most likely a release date for something big
pov: pepinno found mods
Make lap -1 next
Please do final boss pizza tower video
What type of weirdo made this one???
2:56 PEPPINO.EXE LMAOOO
IM NOT TRAPPED IN HERE WITH YOU. YOUR TRAPPED IN HERE WITH ME. me: AH SHIT HERE WE GO AGAIN. ALL YA HAD TO DO WAS FOLLOW THE DAMN TRAIN CJ.
2:02
ANYONE HELP ME PLS I CAN'T STOP  LISTENING TO THIS I'VE LISTENING FOR 8 HOURS
lap 4 with snick .exe
Fun fact! The Lap Number is my birthday!!
I don't think anyone noticed yet, but Peppino uses a pizza oven to make the mods. It's just like the Pizza Oven 'mod', which helps keeps track of the mods you download off of Gamebanana for Pizza Tower. Coincidence? Probably.
Whan you start lap 3 pizza face instantly spawn
PLS make a Pikmin 4
0:22
He did 1,262,023 laps
how many likes for lap 4
You should make lyrics to (my CAT-fidence is Limited) it would be an absolute banger.
One day id love to see "Come Along With Me" with lyrics ^^
At 2:30, the numbers represent the day Pizza Tower released, if you guys didn’t know.  Idk I thought it was a cool fact or smth.
I loved that instead of besting fake peppino he just make him confused by having him copy peppina
Alternative title: *Peppinos Insanity*
It the pufffish meme 2:18
the fact they used pizza oven the mod manager as an actual oven is very clever, nice job recorder man!!!!!!
+He knows every Level with Pizzaface is a joke for him now
1:58 i love how fake peppino is actually really interesting and amazed at peppino
"as an eevee!!!" "...you've lost your mind." "but i've found something-a so much-a better" best moment!
0:09  and I arereddy lahing
and do lap 4 music
Can you do bye bye there?
i like the ms paint stuff
The worst thing is that the eeve mod is an actual mod
Now we just need unexpectancy ( all parts) with lyrics.
Peppino spent 141 years getting to lap 1262023
More like, Peppino's Revenge
Yo this is fire 🔥🔥🔥🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
The music Is very cool
*The Lap Number of Final clip is date* (12/6/2023)
I'm wondering if Peppino is okay... he basically almost directly did a quote from sonic.exe at the end, but replacing 'souls' with 'mods'.
Fun fact: 1262023 is actually the release date for Pizza Tower. 1 means January, 26 means the 26th of January, and 2023 speaks for itself.
Pizza tower mods be like:
i can't stop listening to this
there is a mod manager called litteraly "Pizza Oven" i dont know if this is a reference
Is the final lap number the date of another PT musical?
Do peper man
2:51
Ngl I’m on the enemies side now
There is no known mod that uses this song but a guy whose username is Oofator wrote a UST for pizza tower that's called "Slice of Mayhem". He called it the FINAL LAP song. That would be pretty fitting. https://youtu.be/ONxD0pA6E20
pizza face:WHAT DO YOU WANT!??!?!?!? Peppino:INFNITE-A LAPS!
I just realized when Peppino was fighting the bosses again, did he turn the vigilante into grilled cheese? And is pepper man missing half of his face at the end too?!
HOW MANY LAPS DID PEPPINO DO
Something i didn't see anyone mention is that the thumbnail is basically the one of "it's pizza time" but the roles are swapped
It's official pepino lost his mind
Alt title  Peppino hacks the game to make it 10X because he feels like it
"Oh phooey." got me like 🙂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Do “unexpectancy part 3 next”
2:18 pufferfish 🐡 pizza 🍕
2:28 Mona-Pizza Moment
I like that in the end,There's a fricking sonic.exe reference,And yet , I've seen Nobody Commenting or saying  it
Rip pizza head don't make peppino mad guys
1:59 this goes hard
I love how this is a massive omage to the Pizza Tower Modding community. Definitely should check it out tbh.
pizza face said the poppycock word he just said about poppychickin
Do peper man with licrys   If you dont i will unsubscrice
I want Eevee peppino to be canon. But seriously, i Want more songs like this, a video game world that's Warping and changing because the main player character went crazy and has added like, 100's of mods to their world, chaotic goodness~
Don't watch this in 0.75x
Who aren't you people
2:52 Peppino.EXE
Lap 12/6/23? Something Smells Fishy...
NEW OUTFITS unlocked: evee, pinky pie, wario, waifu peppino
I like to the reference to pizza oven
Rename this to i got to pee
MaimyMayo Peppino: Anxious and sometimes gets mad RecD Peppino: First Anxious, Then Demanding a P-rank with some insanity, and lastly comeplete insanity
2:10to2:20ALL CHARACTERS！！！
Peppino is scarier than Pizzaface/Pizzahead
You know you’ve lost it when the final boss himself is questioning your sanity
the fact that they called him "peppino" is something i dont understand why makes me laugh every time.
Your drawing and lyrics are better in this song in my opinion
Dude. It's just John Gutter. You're gonna freak out when you realise you have to do 18 more levels of this.
waiting for lap 10 (vengeance with a pinch of sauce)
1:58 me right now
My man is good at baking jokes
i like how pizza face wants to kill peppino, but is also kind of worried about him
1:47 How is no one freaking out about how we just heard pepper man and the vigilante. 2:26 And we cannot forget about pizza face
1:34 I’m so tired of Spāaàåæwning baddies
Lap 1262023
But there's a lap 4?
imagine lap 4, but at the beginning, peppino overheats the pizza oven and the game starts glitching!
sonic.exe reference omg
Oh fooey indeed
Pizza Oven?
now, time for absolute absurziti
alternate title: Peppino finds out about mods
Another Banger!! Loved This One
What about lap 4
This is my favorite part  2:00
2:29 12.6.2023?
I like how the thumbnails evolved. In Pizza Time, Peppino is damn terrified of Pizzaface. In The Death I Deservioli, Peppino is still running from Pizzaface but barely scared. In Pillar John's Revenge, Pizzaface is in fear while Peppino towers over him.
what about Calzonification
2:01 is my favorite part
He has broke the laws of physics and our multiverse he’s too strong
1:50 Pepperman: Where am I? Vigilante: What in tarnation?! Noise: Is it time to crush peppino already? Fake Peppino: WhO ArEn’T yOu PeOpLe???  (Edit: I didn’t like my own comment lol)
1:58 PEPPEVE
Peppino Breaking Reality It’s Self And Becomes A Furry:
did anyone notice the sonic exe reference at the end?
take a look at pizza face's nose at 1:10 and 2:03 is good all the way til 2:24
Also pizzaface doing poggers on the thumbnail
At the end when peppino eevee opens the door, at the top of his head it says lap 1262023 it might mean December 6th 2023 or it could just be me 🗿
DID YOU MOD THE ENTIRE GAME! That sentence made me know that both characters know they are in a game
I love the way 2:03 art style looks
The ending is just crazy. I feel bad for pizza head. 2:28
Ya peppino lost his mind
Now lap 4
Is real lap 4
Pizza face is probably regretting threatening to blow up peppino’s restaurant right about now
I love how Fake Peppino's the only boss smiling while Peppino explains his insanity, either due to him being as insane as Peppino is at this point, or he doesn't understand what's going on, and is just happy to be around other people. Also nice touch with Fake Peppina Ramen being anime deformed near the end
XD That part with the Eevee was too good
This was amazing. Such a bop. Also the next fnf lyrics vid should be the annie week. I mean we got garcello a while ago. It would kind of make since. Just a idea
i wish i had pizza mods
I am awaiting for Snick.exe's challenge.
theres a song out there called "stuck for eternioli" that could be a good one to lore
Peppino is insane but somehow as fast as sonic the hedgehog
1/26/2023 or 12/6/2023
"Oh, pan my pizzas, what a nightmare! Thank cheesy goodness all of that poppycock was fake.." "Is that so?" *"Oh phooey-"*  -famous last words
1:56  Peppino: as an Eevee!!!!   Did you know that in terms of making pizza, eevee, is the most efficient Pokémon?
I love it how when peppino turns into an eevee every other boss is confused execpt for fake peppino who just sits there smiling.
They added different pizza tower mods Edit: this is seriously what I commented 9 months ago?!
" INFINITE LAPS! WHILE FIGHTING ALL OF THE BOSSES!! *AS AN EEVEE!!!* " - peppino the spaghetti
do lap 4 next.
2:30 wait i just realized when you look at the lap number it looks like 12/6/2023
BUT IVE FOUND SOMTHING SO MUCH BETTER!.. who needs sanity when this proves none of you can predict my moves racing to this fenetic groove
I like the transition between the titles of the laps, in the first one he is in a panic, then on the 2nd lap he is grinning and in this one he is going insane with those mods
Sonic exe line🤯🤯
That Peppino went so far to include the Eevee mod!... though we should maybe be glad it wasn't the genderswap one?
The lap 1262023 is ACTUALLY the release date for pizza tower. January 26th of 2023 Hope this helps : )
Did you guys know that all the things he has done is all pizza tower mods
I looked at the code...."Peppino = yes"
It's time for lap 4 now
P
this perfectly  replicates the fact that mods are chaotic
Can you do sugary spire?
peppino becoming a eevee make me wonder: "eeveelutions" then i wonder again: "wait a second-"
voicette: pepperman vigilante noise fake is not over died fart, foever peppino is plan idea
Omg just imagine the 4rd lap song
naww, just "aww fooey"
this song is p rank
Hey RecD? When will you add your songs to Spotify?
lap4????
He has became sonic.exe
Forget about how great this is (its great), peppino, HOW DID YOU USE MULTIPLE MODS!?
this is honestly fire, and i love the pixel image with the peeveeno
Ok esto ya se salio de control
12/6/2023?
Peppino.exe isnt real Peppino.exe:
I like how pizza face looks genuinely concerned for peppino.
INFINITE-LAPS! "Oh no" got me
it's funny cause the mod manager is called the Pizza Oven.
1:09 i LOVE how pizzaface becomes self aware at this part, but what I love more is that pizzaface is genuinely concerned for Peppino, after that he immediatly brushes it aside, but in the most GODLY way ever "That itty bitty ounce of concern aside, if it's death you want I'm glad to provide." Great song, only "issue" I have is that *a lot of it isn't really about lap 3* but even then peppino's absolute insanity (and banger) makes up for it.
Mods used:  0:07 Lap 3 1:46 Lap Hell 1:49 All Bosses at Once 1:57 Eevee as Peppino 2:12 Wario Tower 2:14 Pizza Party 2:17 Pufferfish as Peppino 2:19 Peppina Ramen over Peppino
Wait where is pepperman's song
I find it hilarious how he says "or you can call it quits" and only to realise very shortly after that in fact, no they can't and they are, in fact "trapped in here with me"
what has peppino smoked
I love the voice for pizza head
Know what ping me otherwise I ban you some pizza tower by asking McPake to do it I just want people to know my channel exists
lap 3:pizza face come's no matter how much time there still is lap 4 the war timer at 2 minute's reset's every lap
Your old pal Snick awaits you in the next lap Peppino Spaghetti.  Ha ha ha.   Ha ha ha ha!   HA HA HA!!!   HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
Peppino lap one: panic and struggle to find the last topping in pepibot factory Peppino lap 2: determined and ready to get the p rank for john Gutter Peppino lap 3: A madman that wants an even greater challenge than the game has to offer, even restoring to morphing himself into different characters
LAP 4
Lap 10: snick.exe: you aint running from me
Ah phooey 2:31
Bros got to much power
LAP 1262023 2023
What about leaning nightmare
1:58 EEVEE YOU PICK 2:13 WAAAAAAAAAAARIO
The Oven MUST ENDURE.
LAP 4 WITH SNICK pls make it
What I expected: a song about Peppino terrified of pizza face. Questioning why he did he go through the lap 3 portal.  What I got: Peppino becoming your average pizza tower fan.  Edit: also, did anyone else get the sonic.exe reference at the end.
I like how 2023 is in the lap at the end
" OH PHOOEY. " And the position Pizzahead is in at the end.
At 2:30, it says lap 1262023. This seems like a date because 2023 at the end! 1/26/2023 has passed already, so I think 12/6/2023 is going to be something. Edit: nvm its a refrence to the release date of pt
“AS AN EEVEE!”  Me who plays Competitve Pokémon: well he’s fine
the end is so catchy including who ever made that art made it look EXACTLY like the games art style, I LOVE IT SO MUCH
Peppino becoming Plume (The Eevee's official name) made me smile so much considering that that mod is one of my all time favorite mods.
2:30 Something is coming
Nice pizza oven refrence
"INFINITE LAPS " "While fighting ALL OF THE BOSSES" "AS AN EEVEE"
OUTLAPPED PEPPINO MAC:8 POWER LEVEL: 90000
time to wait for lap 4 theme
If LAP 3 was this crazy i wonder how will LAP 4 look like?
NO WAY HE REFRENCED THE SUPER NEAT MDODING TOOL CALLED PIZZA OVEN
The last course of this delicious lap is at 2:02
The real baked start is 0:30
If you want an immediate well baked Pizza Face section, it’s at 0:59
Pizzelle?
Peppino's Most Strongest Form Yet - Mod Peppino Able to make infinite amount of Laps Can turn into any Character Can defeat any Boss easily And his words are " They called-a me crazy, INSANE, PEPPINO!! "
did peppino get possessed by something? or just start gong crazy and well pizza, now you have to be afraid peppino
I love the last few lyrics, it really shows how much he doesn’t care anymore and is just trying to mod and destroy everything and everyone.
Next you should do snicks challenge from the chefs kiss mod
Well we not gonna do lap 4 because there 2 mods lap hell well snick take break and recorderdude for animation and song lyrics everytime lap and +24 hours  to get 1000000 laps every thing gustavo is tried right now i forgot name him every laps and every mod are amazing thank you for lap 3 song lyrics! ❤
Edited. 2:30 1262023. DEC 6 2023. 12/6/2023 its been a year and this leads to nothing.
long story short peppino goes insane and kills pizzaface with a shotgun
2000% peppino 20% pizzaface 2% john 1% bosses
He got all the laps
Peppino's voice is so like normal
Peppino goes absolute god mode
What was that end?
Lap 1: Italian scared of his culture Lap 2: Pizza scared of italian Lap 3: Italian gives PTSD to pizza
i love how at the very end peppino makes a reference to sonic.exe
these UST's be slappin'
I Love this song
Bro just dont care about pizza face
2:30 i did not pay any attention to the number 1262023 at first, as i was so hyped. then i started to wonder… is this a hint at something? did something happen on january 26th 2023, or something will happen on december 6th 2023?  then it hit me  JANUARY 26TH IS THE RELEASE DATE OF PIZZA TOWER  well played, recd, well played
Lyrics (here we go again) :   Peppino: just a lttle longer... almost-a got it...  (Ding!)  Peppino: I T ' S - A - R E A D Y . . .  (Throws a pizza on the air)  Peppino: they called-a me mad-a... INSANE-A!.. PEPPINO!!! But-a finally... i have baked the fourth-a wall! And for the first-a course... IT'S TIME FOR LAP THREE!  Peppino: reality's shifiting at its very core...i've finished with seconds, but i still want-a more...more than pizza time and-a pizza face... this-a lap is the ultimate race!  Peppino: one more lap to prove peppino's stronger and wiser and faster, one more lap to prove this level's totally, completely mastered, one more foe to chase me just to make everything that much tougher, one more go to chase the thoughts away i couldn't hadle rougher  Peppino: never been in this much peril stress levels never been higher vision blurry, feet are aching legs numb but my heart's on fire! No more toppins to collect, no hidden treasure, just a mad dash, countless deadly dangers in my way at long last, an even match!  John ghost (same time as peppino): ohhhhh...peppino, what have you done? Nothing to do now but run! Never planned to display my fury, but your meddling ways has forced me!  Peppino: pizzaface is catching up to my tail! Just one slip-up and i'm certain to fail!  Pizzaface: HAH HAH HAH HAH, Peppino! You're mine! You've taken far too much time! For a simple jog to the exit door! Hey, hang on... haven't we done this before? I don't understand what's happening now... i'm felling even stronger, but how?! It's like the whole world is rewritten to be- oh, you gotta be kiddin' me... did you mod the entire game just to up your chance to wind up maimed? I don't get you, man! What's going on? What about Gustavo, Brick, Stick and John? Do you even have a single tie left to anything else but cheating death? That itty bitty ounce of concern aside... if  it's death you want, i'm glad to provide!  Peppino: come at me, your hopes are zero but i'd like to see you try it, i'm not here to be a hero, it's for sport, i won't deny it! It's the thrill of rushin, chargin, slidin, jumpin, droppin, tryin, knowing that one misplaced barge-in leads to nearly-instant dyin!  Peppino: every muscle at its limits, bones all on the verge of breaking, body barely hanging in at the huge beating that it's taking, i can see the end in sight, it's beautiful, but i can't stop now! Got to bake up something tougher, YES THE PIZZA MUST BE TOPPED NOW!  John pillar ghost(at same time as peppino): ooooh....peppino, the end's in sight! go...finish and set things right...i'm so tired of spawing baddies...wait you mizsed the door, don't you wanna be free?  Peppino: More...i need-a more toppins for the perfect-a challenge, the pizza oven must-a bake-a MORE!  Pizzaface: What more could you want?  Peppino: Infinite-a laps!  Pizzaface: Oh no  Peppino: While fighting all of the bosses!  (Bosses appear)  Pepperman: Where am i?  Vigilante: What in tarnation?  The noise: Is it time to crush peppino already?  Fake peppino: WHO AREN'T YOU PEOPLE?!  Peppino: As an eevee!!!  (Peppino casually turns into eevee)  Pizzaface: You've lost your mind  Eevee: But i've found something-a SO MUCH-A BETTER!  Eevee: Who needs sanity when this proves, none of you can predict my moves, racing to this frenetic groove, quick and fierce as can be!  Wario: You can chase me or call it quits!   Pinkie: You can't face me in brawn or wits  Pupperfish: Crush all record to tiny bits  Peppina: For eternety!  Peppino: I'm not trapped in here with you, you're trapped in here with me! =]  (Pizzahead wakes up)  Pizzahead: Oh, pan my pizzas, what a nightmare! Thank cheesy goodness all o' that poopycock was fake!  (Eevee bashes into the door)  Eevee: Is that-a so?  Pizzahead: Oh phooey
This is the literallerally every pizza tower player when trying to P-Rank every level all in one run + Lap 3 (waiting for unexpectancy)
Lap 1262023: At this point, your just a god.
What did pepino do
@recorderdude What about Unexpectancy?
Where's snick ????
2:02 me in 2023
request: Unexpectancy Part 3 *pizza head and everyone vs peppino AKA the final bossfight*
Oh phooey
I like how this song also included all of the pizza tower mods. Except for the toppin girl s one, meh best not to overthink that part
*Im not stuck with you but you are stuck with me*, jeez pizza head is stuck with him in 1262023 laps
I like the song with a little peppino  too hard
References i could find (2:31) (I got to start of with the mods first) 1. Wario mod (its also a Reference to how the game was made it was the inspiration on wario land) 2. Anime girl mod. It is a real mod by another youtuber (uh dont remind me of the name i know it uh-) 3. Infinite laps that was a really good fan game call *PIZZA TOWER Infinity* 4. Puffer fish mod? (Its just a fish nothing else) 5. All boss mode (its just a reference to the en-(SPORLER AHEAD) ._. That was weird but it was at the end of the game where you fight every boss again just more harder)
Did peppino lose his mind or sanity?
2:52 - 2:57 **peppino.exe has been made!!**
Can you make the Finn el boss
Captures how fucked up the fandom has gotten
Pizzaface has the mugman face and i love it
Do you snick challenge next?
Peppeevee is born.  Pepprio is born. Peppish is born. Pepgirl is born.
unexpectancy next
Can you do lap 4 please?
2:07 I love this picture
THE THREEQUEL ARRIVES
he ran out of time
i think peppino is too crazy crazy? He was crazy once they told him he gonaa destory his restaurant a gunmechine a gunmechine with laser and the  pizza face make him crazy
OH PHOOEY
Peppnani 2:19
2:52 wait, this gives me a theory, do recd said we were gonna get a fnf video right? Maybe endless with lyrics will came out soon
12 6 2023 IS A COOL VID, I CRACKED THE CODE!
Short but awesome
Can you do lap 4? It's a thing. Or lap -1
I can’t hear pillar John ghost
What modding does to a guy.
NOW DO THE PIZZA FACE BOSS THEME UNEXPECTANCY ALL OF THE PARTS
https://youtu.be/h-2LRO8sGCI https://youtu.be/MSzReOhnxXg
Do pepper man next
He has freaking raibies 2:22
I LOVE THIS SM
MAN PEPPINO IS GOING TOO FAR !!!🤯🤯🤯
1:00 I SAW THAT FLINTSTONE REFERENCE IN THE BACKGROUND YOU AIN'T SLICK!😂
bruh wut da hell peppino is now a furry
Fun Fact:  Peppino used Pizza Oven to make more laps (Pizza Oven is a modding tool for Pizza Tower that downloads mods).
_The Matrix has chosen the bright side, congratulations!_
Do lap 10 pls
Why do i feel like the laps in the end is a date It shows 1/26/2023 Or 12/6/2023
Pls do unexpectancy pt 3
this explained all my questions.
1:44  In this moment, those people who had nothing to do, had the possibility to do this
Now I’m excited for the unexpected covers
My cat rip ;(
Love the Eevee.
This feels illegal to watch, 'cuz its too perfectly-made. And when i watch it, i feel like its a August fools joke. ALSO HOW IN THE WORLD DOES PEPPINO KNOW EEVEE. MY BRAIN HURTS-
0:12 what is that face tho
0:22
That is (Showtime Moment)
Lap 1: Panic Lap 2: Confidence Lap 3: what the fuck are you doing
You should make "SNICK IS COMING..." with lyrics, where peppino abuses the pizza oven and summons Snick.EXE
1:10 my favorite part
is it me or just peppino want inf laps he made it past lap 4 where snick.exe comes
2:53 this feels like an exe reference to me
The fact that the final lap count is the game's release date lol
The ending line is hilarious and definitely caught me off guard.   "Oh phooy"
“they called me mad, INSANE! PEPPINO!!!”
Me on my way to create mod pizzas
Nice
PLEASE LAP 4
He got LAP 1262023
0:30 Austrian Painter 😳😳😳
why
Every one  can breaked the  Fourth wall, but only Peppino Spaghetti can BAKED the fourth-a wall!
Plz make more for videos they are so good but if you don’t have permission to do so then that’s fine but try to do it quick I have been waiting so long after your last one.
The fact pizza face is aware the whole thing is a game
As a pizza oven user, this is relatable
Omg thank you you have to do absolute abzuri
wait the laps say 1.26.2023
WAIT pizza oven like the mod thing ???
I just realized the laps peppeevee has is the day the game got realeased
Can you please do lap 4 with lyrics
Am I going crazy,or does that "For eternity" on fake Peppino's part reference his song, when he's says "Pizza Time never ends" like a broken record?
I like how instead of broke its baked😂
I love how after peppino transforms and kills a boss their corpse is in the next shot, peppermans corpse is in the background when peppinky pie turns vigi into a grilled cheese, then the grilled cheesilante is in the background with pufferpino and noise and peppina has who i can only asume to be the noise crumpled up on her head as fake peppina (Peppinar Amen) is flusteredly chasing, surprised I didnt see anyone else acknowledge this tho.   ALSO RECD GIVE US THE OTHER 3 BOSS THEMES AND UNEXPECTANCY WITH LYRICS PLEASE!!!!!😫😫
We got peppino.exe at the end of the video! 2:51
Pls do pepperman
Female mods 2:20
Is this guy going to do lap 4 now?
I know this is unlikely, but i really wanna see more Eevee, it funny and i crave for more outside of the og Eevee mod
2:02
God your sense of timing is just great
its over once peppino discovers about cyop
HE'S GONE MAD WITH POWER! JUST WAIT UNTIL HE FINDS OUT THERE'S A LAP 4 AND A LAP 10 MOD OH GOD- 💀
Can you pls make it loopable? :D
I love how Pizzaface is genuinely concerned about Peppino and is friends.
As a fellow insane man, this is very relatable and 100% accurate Edit: Thank you guys so much for 10 likes❤ Edit pt:2 electric boogaloo: 20 likes holy cow❤️😮
Can you make FNF vs Peppino next?
Hey RecD, I have the perfect idea for a sequel, released the FNF vs Peppino mod, you can write lyrics for the first two songs as if pizza face asked boyfriend for help to defeat Peppino, what do you think?
Okay after watching this and considering how many laps he has done as shown in the end 2:29 there is only one thing that comes to mind now that Peppino has became a god of speed and that ladies and gents is... Peppino Spaghetti vs Speedrunner Mario.
more mods = crashing thegame
Can you make this again except Papino is a noob?
Bro they brought the peppina mod omg
Pizzatowerfan:THANKS FOR THE VID,I WANT IT
I just love this Video and this is Basically a love letter to Pizza tower mods and I do like how the other bosses sound like.
FINNALY
alternative song name: PEPPINOS DANGETTHI’ REVENGE VERSUS EVERYONE IN THE PIZZA TOWER
2:03  I feel like this piece of art especially the facial expression encapsulates the craziness but also extreme fun he’s having at the same time
I love this and the thumbnail of POG pizzaface intrigues me to come back again
2:30 Pepino forgot a boss and now he’s here to collect the real challenge
Peppeevee isn't something I knew I needed in life until now thank you
I was the only one who noticed the reference to the mods being pizzas, and being made by an oven? (If you didn't understand, it's a reference to Pizza oven, which lets you download several mods)
"As an Eevee!" Oh.
Imagine when peppino goes though the room the universe lags do to the combo
You made one mistake for the lyrics. When it said stick and john it was actually snick and gnrome(I forgot how to spell the name)
The lap number at the end, that’s a date.  Expect something big on December 6th
AS AN EEVEE!
now he only has 902348903 more!
If i had a dollar for every time a funny and/or good guy becomes an insane megalomaniac, id had 3 bucks Not much but strange that it happened thrice
Lap 1: Anxious italian man willing to do anything to save his pizzaria Lap 2: got used to it, still wanting to save his pizzaria but he needs MORE. Lap 3: complete insanity, he knows his pizzaria won't be destroyed unless he wants to.
AS A EEVEE 1:56
Finally… it’s here
No sadistic gamemaster expects his victim to enjoy the game more than he does. Pizzahead has created a monster that'll torture him relentlessly for thinking he has any right to mess with someone else's life.
Love the attention to detail, peppino’s lap at the end of the end of the video is 1262023 which 01/26/2023 is the release date of pizza tower!
the pizza oven is a refrence to the pizza tower mod manager, pizza oven.
Question: Did You Mod Pizza Tower, If Yes Than How
Bro 2:02,hits different
cant wait for lap 4 lol. that'll be a fun ride
(Peppeevee is born) XD
1:56 I LOVE THIS PART
You need to release pizza tower final boss theme
Pizza tower boss final música
con que así se ponen los mods de pizza tower...  no me espere que los hacían haciendo pizzas xd
The vid itself was insanziti
Somehow it wasn’t even about John’s Revenge (if lap 3 was in the Vanilla game, than it probably wouldn’t be about mods)
NOW DO LAP 4 WITH SNICK
Hi
1:58 “you’ve lost you mind” “But I’ve found something so much better!” Why do I feel like that’s so simple yet has never been used
OH NO IS THAT THE PIZZA OVEN
You know...there is this doom mod called SRB2 that literally turned the game into A SONIC GAME and ppl have made addons for that like adding more characters, making maps bigger n' stuff like that, THE POINT: there is a mod that makes sonic.exe chase after you, which can be combined with a pizza time mod and I like to put pillar john's revenge while doing that and dang that feels C O O L ngl and yeah I didn't know where to comment this and I remembered that while whatching this.
2:53 on this part my guy turns into sonic.exe or lord x or some sh- KID FRIENDLY
Bro i want skibidi toilet
Where's lap 4?
next vidyo is the final boss pizza  tower
The best one is “pizza time never ends”
Lap 1: peppino is scared as heck Lap 2: hes confident Lap 3: HE DOESNT CARE.
This is the in top 3
you can put lap 4 please,with snick.exe
Peppino when he finds mods:
Basically the laps:  Common pizza time: anxiety and the wish for the last toppin Lap 2: Obsession for the P-rank Lap 3: Insane, doesn't even care anymore and wants more of that slice of P-ranks, T-ranks or whatever ranks idk
Now its time for lap 4
peppino, you literally p ranked every single level and fought all the bosses without modding! HOW IS THAT NOT ENOUGH?!?!?!
Lap 4
For some reason I feel like laps in Pizza Tower will be the equivalent of Last Breath phases in Undertale.
ngl the number on the lap race thing could hint to something in the future or i am tripin i think its  december  6  2023
Pizzahead final words: Oh flooy…
"Is that-a so?" "Oh, phooey." golden also there's no way you even referenced Pizza Oven
As an EEVEE!!! 1:56
i like how you made it a PIZZA OVEN bcuz the mod manager is called pizza oven :DD
Peppino = yes
I feel like this video gives you Peppino's sanity, and I am all for it.
I love how pizza face is actually concerened for peppino and at the same time just wanting him to die
1:56 Peppino has officially gone insane
Feels 1 minute
Mod No. 4 Pizzahead ibe like "Back to fake peppin_ number 1..."
I waited whole time then bam
In the code: Enemy count: 620 Pizzaface Time: 0 Time  Peppino: y e s
2:29 Fun Fact: The numbers on the laps says 1/26/2023, which is when Pizza Tower was released
Lap 1: An Italian man escapes death to get a simple A  Lap 2: That same Italian man returns to humiliate his pursuer and get a higher rank  Lap 3: The Italian man returns one last time to lose his sanity and mentality for  *fun*  Character development
Love it I'm still waiting for The Vigilante song
Peppino turned into an Eevee
Me:man this is a good song The end:
I just love the fact that the amount of laps Peppino did refrences the release date of Pizza Tower.
At the is sonic.exe reference bro pepino is Italian rage insane mod
Pep how much laps you need  Imagine that number with the laps and when making the mod about it bruh
I want a song that's Gustavo switching with Peppino in one of the levels and figuring out what he's done, then setting a trap with pizza head, stick and  Pillar John to stop him, of course the ending would be up to you but Peppino needs the pizza cooker in order to mod anything...
Perfect combo  Funk weird scary goofy and good 👍
Still hoping you'll be able to do unexpectantcy one day
Lap 4
Peppino as a power mad villain for Pizza Tower 2? That would actually be awesome to see something like this along with console ports of Pizza Tower to go along with the Steam version.
Missed opportunity to say “Pizzaface is catching up to my tail, but after this Pizzaface will be very stale”😂😂😂😂
Do lap 4 the secrot mod
1:55   Who aren't you people? -fake peppino 2023
Are you sure it’s pillar John  revenge or peppino’s modding revenge
everything was good until he turned into an eevee ?
Dang, Peppino's villain arc is something I never thought I would see, but hell yes.
0:21
1:46 me when i first used pizza oven
0:18 and for the first course........
2:02 insane PEPPINO
the only one left to do really is unexpectancy, keep up the good work!
Can you do a video? On the Eevee mode like we get a story about Eevee
Hey rec what is coming on 12/6/2023
Peppino:AS A EVEE
Now its time for Absolute AbsurZiti (lap 4) and the music of other laps like: Maniac Pasta lap 5 (And that is all XD)
You don't drive Peppino insane with a giant tower and expect to come out unscathed
song
How about lap 4?
Make another one  pizza towers  pizza head
This is beyond perfect 🎉🎉🎉
peppino has some bars
I want to see bye bye there (crumbling tower) with lyrics
2:29 december 6th, 2023
Has anyone else seen how Peppino lose his fright against Pizzaface in the miniatures?
Its so incredible how RecD can make so much character development, especially for peppino, in his music of pizza tower
I’m not telling you have to but… when will you do lap 4?
Soo cool
The official PT modding theme
peppino has 100% lost it
The final have laps 1262023 is a date 12/06/2023
2:31 i think the lap number is some sort of date
SONG GOOOOOOOOOD
You should try to make lap 4 song
Lap 4
i swear to god the lap he's on at the end of the song looks like it could be a date but it could just be a coincidence idk
you cant lap 4 pls
Lap 4
lap 1: last topping lap 2: for  the pizza pal 3: the pizza oven  lap song names
As soon the playable character mods came in i was like: ok what the f-
imagen RecD does noise lap 1 and noise lap 2 lol
I’m not trapped in here with you you trapped in here with me 2:22
This is the video when you know the players (as Peppino) have lost it with their mods; guess Pizza Tower (and pizza time) will never end.
Bro took a day to lap that
The SNICK IS COMING WITH LYRICS PLS
Peppeevee fills me with such glee.
Pov: I downloaded awrey mod for pizza tower  That was bad but pls like my comment
WHEN LAP 4
Why is nobody discussing the sheer power behind Peppino's clap back to Pizzaface's "You've lost your mind"  "But I've found something so much better" is just so fucKING COOL
Didn't notice the first time listening, If you check the back of peppino when he passes john. He has missing textures on his back
ITS TIME FOR LAP 3!!!
LAP4 LAP5  LAP6 LAP7  LAP8
Peppina looked so cute!^^ (My friend used to think it was his favorite character. Which is Peppina that is)
I love the vocal effects on Peppino he sounds so GOOD
Pillar john's revenge? this should be called Chef Peppino's revenge
Make a party of this
I wanted to write Creepypasta based on this video
This song is a reference to the craziness of pizza tower mods
1:58 EEVEE YAY
Peppino went through a mental breakdown, still hilarious as Pizza Face, who should be trying to kill him is concerned for Peppino
It would be ideal if they added a mod piss towel
I’m watching a video and it’s glitching out I meant to say I’m watching the video
Know what I was told that you’re making myself small present is people start subscribing to my channel we’re not my turn to be my sisters channel but still we share the channel I times to upload a video with tried is two times and it didn’t work both times I’m so we can sit on how I didn’t work😅😅😅But we will get to show up on one and again we are literally doing with the well pop it in my friendly neighbourhood doing join the story with getting a show back on the road and change the first two episodes they’ll be new Lego characters are popping out every now and again depending on which location are you at your bless everyone of my family members own the Lego I can probably start making us this long I’m going back to my roots are making on commentsWho knew I had to go back to my roots not me
If you had to choose a pizza tower mod that Mc Pig makes official, what would it be?(In my case the peppina mod)
I made 2 slip-ups in JG on Lap 3 and still made it out the door with enough time to get all my taunt points! YIPPEE
The season pass revenge
It's so many bods it's at so many times
LAP 4
This is probably a chef you don't want to mess with
2:51 Sonic.exe Secen
cool, now make a lap 4 one please.
i like how he used the "pizza oven" as a pizza tower modding tool reference
i wanna see both a lap 1,2, and 3 for war now since lab 3 for war is possible
“Thank god that was all a nightmare!” *Eevee Peppino crashing in the door:* Bonjour
boss 1 beated by: wario. boss 2 beated by: pinkie pie. boss 3 beated by: a pufferfish. boss 4 beated by: peppina, female peppino.
it so good i love it but i wish the song was longer also i like your pepperman and vigilante voice.
"absolute absurziti with lyrics whe-"
woag
Can you do sugary spires song
Hey, pizza head, be thankful he didn't whip out his shotgu- -shotgun pump- ....shi-
"AS AN EEVEE!!!"
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Fun fact: peppinos lap counter at the end is the date pizza tower was released
Nah the ends oh phooey at the end gets me every time
LAP 4 PLEASE 🙏
2:02
That is too much lap
OKAY, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, DON'T ASK TO MAKE A LAP 8 COVER. (I'm asking people, not @recorderdude)
*Hide the water stone.*
I love how Peppino progressively became more confident in his abilities so much so ti become smug about it
And for the third course it’s time for lap 3
I like to believe this is what peppino does between pizza portals
When Peppino said: "While fighting all of the bosses!", he has doomed Pizzaface, as he has gone from being the chaser to being a fightable boss, and he has no escape anymore.
We need unexpectancy with lyrics frr
If now lap 4
1:00 Pizzaface got confused 1:46 PEPPINO CALM-A DOWN! 2:29 wait-a! Does the amount of laps mean something?
unexpected 3 intro be like: 1:50
I found an Easter egg it said 2023 on his final number
Lap 1:scared but does what be must be Lap 2:determined to be perfect Lap 3:bloodlust for mods
Well peppino did say innlap 2 he would stay for lap 3... Also, R.I.P. Pizzahead You shall be remembered
Recd when you gonna to do Bye bye there! With lyrics?
Where does this fit into the recd pizza tower timeline?
I love how pizzahead's voice is all old cartoon quality and sounds like an announcer
Something coming on 12/6/2023, 2:30 to prove
People who miss the old fnf musicals button here 👇
Pizza = Power-ups
Кто тоже русскоязычный и не понимает что тут происходит короче тут история про то что Пипино накатил модов
How about… LAP 4
POV: players who won pizza tower more than 20 times and find the pizza oven
0:58 AH HA HA HA >:D
Fanlily lap 3
Can you do lap 4
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhyhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Lap 4 please
At 2:29, Peppino (as an Eevee) holds a checkered flag saying "LAP 1262023". The number 1262023 is probably representing the date 12th June 2023. What's it trying to say here? RecD's birthday or smth?
i only realised about the pizza oven because of the pizza tower mod manager  pizza oven also the next one for lap ones should be lap 4 only because i'd be amazing like this one
lap 1262024 with lirics when?
EVVEE?!
2:30 I’m not the only one that notices the release date for pizza tower here, right?
Can’t wait for the ytp
Now we need Lap 4 to complete the series
What happens if you went to Lap ? (? Means a number that’s unknown and the number has too much value. You can call this “?”, Never
1:43 "AS AN EEVEE!"
Okay now One remains:Unexpentensy (or what is called) part 1-2-3
It sound better when its at 1.25x
Peppino is a ding ding and psychic chaos
Oh my god
Epic song keep it going bro noicee
RecD simply showing how long it takes to load the lap 3 mod on some computers XD
can you make a bye bye there with lyrics please
I don't know which of the artists did Peppeevee, but they did an excellent job; just wanting to see that picture has kept me coming back, nevermind the incredible song I get alongside it!
Peppino did lost his mind
Peppino Has Flown Off The Handle EDIT: Did Anyone Notice When Peppino Barges Into Pizza Heads Room The Lap Is Lap 1262023. So Maybe There's Something Coming On 12/6/23? I Also Like How When Pizzaface Comes In He Says His First Lines From Lap 2 With Lyrics
You used Peppina Ramen!?
I love how peppino doesn't acknowledge john at all like he was an actual ghost
Lap 4 gotta be impossible 🗿
wait the pizza oven is canon
aw phooey well since you have a voice for all the bosses now you might as well do the bosses
0:26 if no one noticed peppino put a 0 near enemy count=62 so its now enemy count=620 💀
Not canon
+ What does the 1262023 lap mean?
When Peppino turned into eevee i said the same what Pizza face said, You lost your mind Peppino🤣
Pizza head: oh it's nightmare, Peppino:no nightmare: Pizza head:f...
*Every Boss And Infinite Laps Enabled.* "AS AN EEVEE-" What More Copyright Is There-
I love the peppina ramen reference
In make some noise, Noise has the upper hand. In this, *Peppino has too many upper hands.*
lap 25 when?
Uhhh. The end.
This song is so good i like it
Atleast he didnt mod for topping gals.he is not completly insane
The laps is a reference to the release date of the on purpose?
In every pizza tower song with lyrics have very cool moments how this 2:02
im realizing the lap peppino is at during the end is 1262023. which is the day pizza tower was released. nice detail there
When your nemesis is concerned for your sanity.
why did pizzahead's nose change from mushroom to meatball to tomato to mushroom
I’m feeling hard down there
When you go too fast and then you can't stop... PIZZA TIME INFINITY
cant wait for lap 4 lyrics
I imagine peppino being more scared and stressed in lap 3 not like confident
I would love an unexpectancy with lyrics
From observation Pizza Face was trapped in there with Peppino.   (banger btw)
Ok…just ONE more listen… (I have said this 80 times)
Wait a minute, Lap 1262023? Is that some kind of code…
12/06/2023
RecD,this is amazing as always ! if i ever tried to make a video like this,it would look pretty shitty,but the vids you make,PERFECTION
What a beautiful nod to the modding community. Also great to see my favorite track around the game to be done in such a way. Particularly fond of that ending jingle. Peppino really do be a mad lad. xD
"Infinite-a Laps! While FIGHTING ALL THE OF THE BOSSES! AS AN EEVEE!!!" Dear god he's lost his mind, WHO LET HIM COOK!?!?
RecD theres still lap 4 song
Fun Fact: The Lap Peppino was on in that last shot is 1262023. A number that correlates to the original game’s release date. (1/26/2023)
Who are you people! Patrik
lap 1262023 is wild
Mods
he made my dream come true, I must now play lap 3 with this music
"oh phooey" - Pizzahead's final words
This entire song is a fever dream
I love that he was turning into mods
I'm...still...insane.....
I just knew the at the end of the music peppino has gone 1262023 laps and I think there’s going to be a lap 4 with lyrics because  it’s December 6 2023 so I think he will be releasing a lap 4 with lyrics.
Bop
1:00 Not only do i love the way this references pizzaface in lap 2, but i also love how genuinely concerned pizzaface sounds. You know it's bad when *pizzaface* is concerned for peppinos health.
It’s Pizza Time: Peppino still barely knows what he’s doing. Hasn’t gotten through the tower yet. Missed a toppin. *PANIC-*  The Death I Deservioli: Pep has a grip on the controls and knows what he’s doing. He’s wanting to challenge himself, and therefore goes for a P Rank.  Lap 3: *PURE MODDED MASOCHISM*
YEAH FINALLY!!! this was great!
i love how pep is basically getting revenge from make some noise
0:22 This part is a perfect start to a song.
Peppino's personality keeps changing in all the songs, in IT'S PIZZA TIME he has a scared and nervous personality of not getting the last topping and getting caught by PIZZA FACE. in LAP 2 he has a determined and determined personality to complete LAP 2 and get the P RANK. and in LAP 3 he already totally lost his sanity, just wanting to have more and more LAPS without stopping, regardless of everything else.
If you think about it, the one who is doing all this torture to the bosses is not Peppino, it's us, the players who are controlling Peppino, he told us that we don't have more content after LAP 2 and we decided to resort to mods to having more challenges just to satisfy our insatiable desire for more and more content realizing that if the characters had a conscience they would be suffering while peppino or rather the player is doing more and more LAPS non-stop realizing that the villain is not pizza head ni peppino we are
Jesus
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you’ll ever hear. All of us, without exception, have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). And because God is just and will not let sin go unpunished, the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). As a result, that means that as sinners, we will all get what we rightly deserve: eternal punishment, which is called the second death. But the good news is that God is loving and does not wish that any should perish but that all would come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). So He made a way for us to be saved and now graciously offers you the free gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ (Romans 6:23), all while justice is done. He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on behalf of us and pay for our sins on a cross, and He was then buried and rose again on the third day (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Regardless of who you are or what you may have done, if you believe with your heart the gospel ( ^^ which I just mentioned above) and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, you shall be saved (Romans 10:9,10). Salvation is simple and free. It’s not a 12 step program, and don’t think, as many do, that you just have to be a “good person” or do good works to go to heaven. Salvation is based on what Jesus did, not what you do (Ephesians 2:8,9). Believe in Christ, and you will be saved. “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever should believe in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through Him.” John 3:16,17
"oh phooey" is right.
Oh no its POKEMEMES
Bro at the end i thought he was gonna say “oh sh-“ but instead oh phooey.
PEPINO ACTUILY STAYED FOR LAP 3
I love the added detail of Pizzahead having a tinny voice like he's on some old-fashioned TV show
2:11 my fav part
Yo can you make "Other Side" from Analog Funkin with lyrics?
if i had to be honest i would smash eve dont judge me>:D
WHY AN EVEE?
And finally, puppy and return this event to a girl.😂
Third, papino dinners event to Apopka fish.😂
Second, popino turnip soap into pinky pie.😂
Papino turned his oath into wavio.😅
I thought I'd be scared by the third round...
I love the eevee mod here lol
peppino done entered his villain arc ☠️☠️☠️
1:51 pepperman and vigilante voice reveal
Peppino has gone mad has 😦
Maybe I’m going insane like pepino but I feel like the lap count is important for some reason. Like 1262023 might be a random number but I feel like it’s a date, like: 12/6/2023 or 1/26/2023.  (The lap count is at: 2:31 if you were wondering)
i like how the oven making mods is a reference to the pizza tower mod handler called "pizza oven"
Let me Remind Everybody,    He literally just trapped Everybody into hell, transforming the world as he pleases, he’s filled with happiness during this,Completely bulldozing the bosses without even trying,If assumptions are correct and hes Is not about to go ballistic,This man doesn’t even care about his restaurant in this, evidenced by pizzaheads/faces rant, and art,Showing The restaurant,All of this is just fueled by Complete Happiness and adrenaline,It’s all my analyzing is correct, (I just made this in 2 hours,Very light analyzing was made, sorry if I get anything wrong and feel free to correct me.)                                                                                                      The equivalent of expectancy is going to a a rave to be never forgotten.
i love pizzaheads voice i want more of it please
2:30 waiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit thats a date
Nice
Fun fact at the end peppino is on lap 1262023 aka when pizza tower got popular in 2023 and the so many mods so little time is a reference to lord x
do unexpectancy part 3 next because it go's HARD
1 like = one vote for Peppino to gain his sanity back
If I tell you the truth, the music is excellent and everything, although I expected more lap 3, what I'm saying is that I expected more what it feels like to do the third lap, in a few concentration, skills and ability, example: lap 3 of the war level. (And if I know that the music is not in the war level)
Bro's gotta do Lap 4 now
LAP 4 PLEASE!!!!!!
? Sabastion
Recd Peppino really is insane, he changed the enemy count from 62 to 620
im i the only one that sees a release date in the ending cutsecne
Pepipno is a hacker
i kinda get it how peppino gets mod from the “pizza oven” bc theres this pizza tower modding application called pizza oven
2:31 so... if im reading this right... something special is coming on december 6th... or im just a idiot and that number means nothing
I just noticed the lap number at 2:30 is the Pizza Tower release date!
Peppeevee. *Pizza Chef's Kiss* beautiful.  "There was a point were we should've stopped and we clearly passed it long ago😥...LET'S KEEP GOING!!!😈😈😈"
I like how this song's bpm is higher so a lot of the lyrics just blend together in a psychotic haze (very fitting for this mod)
2:03 - 2:24 fav part
The fact that peppino isn't even afraid but he's going insane just to prove that he's capable of beating the tower is relatable to me somehow
This dude has lost his mind! pizza face, What have you done?!
OH NO THE EVEE GOT OUT NOW HES CAUSING LAP CHAOS (lol)
Reality's shifting at its very core, I'm finished with seconds, but I still want more, More than Pizza Time and-a Pizzaface, This lap is the _ULTIMATE_ race!!  One more lap to prove Peppino's stronger and wiser and faster! One more lap to prove this level's totally, completely mastered! One more foe to chase me just to make everything that much tougher! One more go to chase away the thoughts I couldn't handle rougher!  _(Oh, Peppino, what have you done?)_ Never been in this much peril Stress levels never been higher _(Nothing to do now but run!)_ Vision blurry, feet are aching Legs numb but my heart's on fire! _(Never planned to display my fury)_ No more Toppins to collect No hidden treasure, just a mad dash _(But your meddling ways have forced me)_ Countless deadly dangers in my way At long last an even match!  Pizzaface is catching up to my tail! Just one slip up and I'm certain to fail! (AH HAH HAH HA!)  Peppino! You're mine! You've wasted far too much time For a simple jog to the exit door... Wait, hang on, haven't we done this before? I don't understand what's happening now... I'm feeling even stronger, but how? It's like the whole world is rewritten to be- ...Oh, you gotta be kidding me...  Did you mod the entire game Just to up your chance to wind up maimed?! I don't get you, man! What's going on? What about Gustavo, Brick, Stick and John? Do you even have a single tie left To anything else but cheating death? That itty-bitty ounce of concern aside, If it's death you want, _I'm happy to provide._  Come at me, your hopes are zero But I'd like to see you try it! I'm not here to be a hero, It's for sport, I won't deny it! It's the thrill of rushing, charging, sliding, jumping, dropping, trying, Knowing that one misplaced barge-in leads to nearly instant dying!  _(Oh, Peppino, the end’s in sight!)_ Every muscle's at it's limit Bones all at the verge of breaking! _(Go...finish and set things right!)_ Body barely hanging in From the huge beating that it's taking! _(I'm so tired of spawning baddies,)_ I can see the end in sight, It's beautiful, but I can't stop now! _(Wait, you missed the door, don't you wanna be free?)_  Got to bake up something tougher, Yes, the pizza must be topped now!!  More...I need-a more toppings for the perfect-a challenge!! The pizza oven must-a bake *MORE!!*  What more could you _WANT?!_  _INFINITE LAPS!!_  _Oh no._  WHILE FIGHTING ALL OF THE BOSSES!  (Where am I?!)  (What in tarnation?!)  (Is it time to crush Peppino already...?)  (WHO AREN'T-A YOU PEOPLE?!)  *AS AN* *_EEVEE!!_*  ...You've _lost your mind._  _But I've found something SO MUCH_ *_BETTER!!_*  _Who needs sanity when this proves_ _None of you can predict my moves?!_ _Racing to this frenetic groove_ _Quick and fierce as can be!_  _You can chase me or call it quits!_ _You can't face me in brawn or wits!_ *_Smash all records to tiny bits!_* *_FOR ALL ETERNITY!!_* _I'm not trapped in here with you,_ *_YOU'RE TRAPPED IN HERE WITH ME!!_*  Oh...pan my pizzas, what a nightmare! Thank goodness all of that cheesy poppycock was fake-  _Is that so??_  Aw phooey.  So many mods, so little time... *_Wouldn't you agree?_*
why does peppino at the start sound like me when i’m about to jack off
Lap 4
cant wait to see Lap  FOUR  OR......UNEXPECTANCY!
Patafoin need to see this
Más  me gustada el otro diseño de pepino
The fact peppino dosent even care about his sanity nor his life just proves how crazy Peppino is, and how he knew he was aware he was in a game is just insane.
LOL WE SEE PIZZA HEAD FOR THE FIRST TIME
That “Is that-a so?” belongs in an anime.
I love how each of the bosses voices fit there character perfectly
Did peppino get more bald?
I like how Fake Peppino turns into Fake Peppina to match the real one. Is that a product of modding, or does he just see that Peppino looks like an anime girl and goes "Holding these-a horses, I'm-a supposed to be looking like-a that one! I can't be doing all these oblivious mistakes!" and molds himself into an anime girl.
Funny😂
oh phooey
What about Absolute Absurziti?
So many mods so little time.. wouldn't you agree?
Now that we finally know what the rest of the bosses voices sound like, it makes me more and more excited for Unexpectancy with lyrics whenever it releases. Can’t wait to hear Pizzahead’s part in the song.
he sounds like a 80s guy on tv "oh phooey" "cheesy goodness" "poppycock" all 80s sounding words
ok who told peppino about the game banana mod page for pizza tower? Who did it? Who caused this?
First lap AAAAAAAA second lap AAAAA AAAAAAA   3rd lap Ah crude
Damn didn’t expect the mlp mod to get shown. Since it’s relatively new     Also holy fuck the mod communty is so dedicated to quality it’s scary
Why is this the perfect embodiment of modding pizza tower?
Lap 1: Scared and Worried Lap 2: Determined. Lap 3: INSANE AND CRAZY
Can you make unexptancy pt 3 with lyrics ? Please please please
2:51 The reference to this is Sonic.exe: So many souls to play with so many time... Do you agree?
Peppeevee is cannon now. Fight me.
“Please Mcpig don’t turn me into a Pokémon!”
In this lap peppino is more like a crazy siencist playing with reallity 1:58 is like everyone thinking pepinno is trully insane and fake peppino is like  fluffy :D
Pls do sugary spire lyrics next! (Glucose getaway, sweet release of death)
And add snick i want to hear his voice
Make lap ! Aka lap four ❤
I have a dumb question. When they briefly showed Peppina ramen there was two of her, implying the other is actually fake peppino... all this to ask, does fake peppina have a canon design yet? Otherwise, great vid. Laugh every time i hear "he's lost his mind."
please read my comments, even if only in the heart. I am a beginner YouTuber from Indonesia.
The fact that the mod loader for pizza tower is called “Pizza Oven” is perfect
Do you think sugary spire would get this treatment when it is complete
One thing to say... no more mods peppino
Where's Lap 4? (I'm Jolking)
IS THAT A SONIC.EXE REFERENCE?
I loved the beginning and the end
This is goofy or I just don’t get it
im not traped in here with you your trapped in here with me!
Bro, how are Pepinos legs still running after over 1 million laps
Make more like this
Bro did 1262023 laps
That eevee art looks neurotic and i love it
2:24 pizza head sounds like alastor or is it me
I love the subtle reference to “The Pizza Oven”  Which is a if not the most popular mod manager for Pizza Tower
If there is going to be a lap 4 i wonder what insanity it wil be
The lap counter is a date ot is 12/6/2023 or december 6th 2023
i have a Feeling Lap 4 is next
Peppino's insanity is certainly infectious, i can't stop grinning every time i listen to this! Wonderful work as always 🎉
“who needs sainty when this proves” that got me rollin on the floor
Bro there is low and INSTANT PIZZA
theres john flinstone at 1:16
Can you do lap 4 pls❤❤ i liked the song
GOOD GOD, PEPPINO!! YOU’VE GONE COMPLETELY INSANE!!
No one cares peppino became a eevee 💀
I am still waiting for bye bye there
Not to be the “Um Aktually” guy, but technically Peppino couldn’t separately install mods into the game, not to mention he wouldn’t even be able to do that while inside the game, but I guess you couldn’t have peppino install mods at all otherwise…  Still a good song anyway!
pls create Sugar Rush PLS
Esta epicardo y eso que no entiendo nada de ingles
Bro, honestly i have to say i cant believe eevee, pinkie pie and peppina ramen appeared in the video, also this video its awesome, i love it.
The pure concern from Pizzaface and all the others not knowing what the heck is going on... This is true Unexpectacy.
I think the chef guy went crazy
"Oh phooey"
Lap 3 doesnt exist????????????
RecD LOVE your videos ive seen your fnf and pizza tower videos and i have two requests 1:can you do a mr trololo week whit lirics? Or more like a  evacuate one? (From the incident 1.8) 2:an unexpectancy or absolute absurdziti (lap 4) whit lyrics  I know you take your time yo do your videos so i'll be patient
I want 1000 where it’s just pay the Pillar John singing
Eevee, Wario, pinkie pie, and Peppina Ramen
Nice sonic.exe refrence
bro decided to mix all of the mods existing into 1
Why does 2:02 hit so hard man
1:58 Pizzaface actually sounds like he's concerned for Peppino.
12/6/2023... Hm.
WE NEED LAP 4 IT MUST BE PERFECT MUST GET THE T RANK
the "oh phooey" pizzahead does at the end is just... so in character
Uno reverse 2:12  What does this sandwich taste like? 2:15  AAAAAAAAAA 2:18  What? 2:20  The last thing you said before you die 2:22
…
Fun fact... All three of the thumbnails of the lap themes shows a story of the tables turning on pizza face...
I noticed peppino gets more insane with every song
“WHO AREN’T-A YOU PEOPLE!?!?”
Lap 1: Trying to get a P Rank Lap 2: Still Trying Lap 3: PURE INSANITY Lap 4: BRAINDEAD Lap 5: NO LIFE Lap 6: STOP IT Lap 7: I WILL DELETE YOUR PIZZA OVEN Lap 8: RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW Lap 9: STOOOOOOOOOOOP Lap 10: YOU'RE BREAKING TIME AND SPACE Lap 11: GET OUT OF THIS INSANITY Lap 12: YOU'RE GOING CRAZY MINDED!

Yo 15 on trending???
hard cut to the world's tallest piledriver
He has become crazy Bwahahaha! I respect that
AS AN EEVEE
Awesome! Love the callback to the lap 2 video when Pizza Face appears!
You might think Fake Peppino should have turned into Ditto once Peppino became Eevee... But what if he DID become Ditto and simply shapeshift into Fake Peppino to confuse us?
the pizza oven resembles the tool used for loading mods.
Even Pizzaface is concerned for Peppino now.
Question, was peppino meant to have an echo at the begging of the song?
Pepeevee.
finally this music
nobody noticed that the laps displayed the games release date 1262023 = January 26th 2023
Fake peppinos cameo and ONE line made my day and i hope he's in unexpectancy 3
Pizza head made Peppino's day hell, so he's simply returning the favor.
I don't think peppinno is peppino anymore,he's just straight up the player.
This is like Marathon Infinite's ending now that I remember.    (Spoiler, but the game is decades old now) You beat the game, you become a god and make your own worlds and such.
THIS WAS AMAZING! Even including PATAFOIN’S MOD!?  Looking back it all looks amazing!
I love how RecD did peppino.exe in end Peppino: "So many months, and so little time... Wouldn't you agree?" Pizza Head: "What have i done..."
Peppino: Lap 1: YEAoOoOoOoOOWWW! Lap 2: I need a P Rank. Lap 3: *I* *N* *S* *A* *N* *I* *T* *Y*
Cool😮😮
👏👏👏
Pizza Oven in a nutshell:
Every time Peppino uses a playable character mod it changes Feppino as well. That has to be confusing for him/it/whatever Feppino really is
Notice at the end it says LAP 1262023. 12/6/2023 (December 6, 2023) Is this when another song comes out?
I love it how peppino brought all shows into pizza tower and turned into eevee
Pls (please) keep this on loop video😊
This isn’t pizza tower… this is PEPPINO’S tower
Mad respect to Peppino, he got to lap 1262023 as an eevee
Pizza tower is best game :)
1 day gang
bruh you forgot the toppin girls mod lol that would be funny
1:55 WHO ARENT YOU PEOPLE?! 2:31 oh phooey..
Do LAP 4
LET ME OUT OF THIS LEVEL, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, RECD!!!
I love how at this point peppino is so used to stress that he’s basically just become a masochist
The best video I ever seen it's like better lab 1 and 2
what does it mean by the 26th January 2023?
The best phrase ever:”Oh phooey”
Anyone catch the 12/6/2023 in the score at the end or am i just being dumb?
things most people probably havent noticed in this song: 1. at the end, peppino does 1262023 laps, which is pizza tower's release date (1/26/2023)  2. when peppino enters the lap portal you can see "INSANITY = MAX" on the top of the portal. that probably means that his insanity is from the code.  3. the artstyle after every part where theres peppino using the pizza oven is the microsoft paint art style  4. after pizza face finishes his rant, you can see the show time text going down, so the recording isnt made from the lap 3 mod (in this part hopefully)  5. the first topping peppino places on magical pizza to add infinite laps is kind of hidden but its pepper because i can see that you can see the last part of pepper, and its red. the second text i cannot find out.   6. (obvious) peppino places a pokeball on top of the pizza when he becomes an eevee  7. when the noise says "is it time to crush peppino already?" it references make some noise  8. (obvious) pizzahead is in dept  i will edit this message when i notice more things
i am a hater and i hate this -hater
something will happen 12/6/2023
Nah bro this is peppinos revenge
1:00 Love the reference to lap two! I also love the fact that since you've uploaded videos of normal Pizza Tower, Pizzaface (and Peppino) know they're in a mod. Juno also did this with their Giga Spamton/Another Snowgrave video a while back ("Perhaps I had to change the plot, but face it Bambi you've been caught") and I love seeing it. (Not saying I think you got inspired by Juno, I'm just pointing out the only other time i've seen this.)  Edit: Puntcuation  Edit: I love how in Laps 2 and 3, Pizza Face is genuinely (and rightfully) concerned for Peppino
This proves that peppino is a power hungry god
Can You Do Lap 4 Absolute Absurziti With Lyrics Next?
Me when i get mods for gorilla tag and im about to use then
how can u have multiple mods without it crashing
This went from lap 3 to a dream I would have at night
What happens next He got touched by pizza face and lose
he turned in to eevee!
Is that sonic exe word in Knuckles
" I'm not trapped in here with you  you're trapped in here with me. "  weirdly my favorite part of this song.
Me after beating so many games on roblox, every platnium in every game on the ps1, the hardest games, speedran every game in 1st place:
Oh the glory of mods.
At this point Peppino isnt a mad man with anxiety, no, at this point Peppino is a psycho
2x speed is goofy audio
I WANT LAP 4 PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wait a minute.... To bake these mods..... Wait oh no why what... Did he use... A "Pizza Oven" Oh my god... BEST JOKE EVER
I feel like the eve part is based on a YouTuber it just came to mind
Can you do lap π?
Pepino is officially super crazy
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS!! THANK YOU
2:12 basically peppino
…….what just happened-?
stop posting shit lyrics with good songs
Peppino turns crazy LOL,I like the mod from Eevee too in lap 3 with lyrics 😂 1:56
He really likes modding his game
Please give us more pizza tower ive loved all that youve made so far and they just keep increasing in quality but im sure whatever you make next will be amazing
What have I done
12/6/2023. . . I have a feeling that's a hint to something.
YESSS
Plot twist: Peppino does lap 4
I can not wait for lap 4 or 5 if you are going to make them
1:49 cool
I love how he enables mods using a literal pizzaoven, thats genius
wait u do have a pepperman oh okay
i want u to add an final boss and pepperman
HAHAHAHAHAHA XDXD, BERY NICE
yessssss s s sss
Infinite ♾️ Laps! 1:47 While fighting all of the bosses! 1:48 As an Eevee! 1:56 🤩😎👍 But Peppeevee got something-a so much-a better! 2:00
I like how he defeats all the bosses (especially the one as wario)
Pepino’s villain arc has completed
epic
Plz do big engine brawl
The fact that he became eevee for no reason made it hilarious
HE FOUND THE MOD MANAGER
this is basically what happens when a pizza tower player gets bored and downloads a mod.
peppino has gone insane with the mods.
Pizza man (final boss) has mug man's voice (at least it sounds like it)
Play this at 2x peppino is explaining fnaf lore
Ah phooey theres a ducktales reference-
Can you do snick Challenge with lyrics
Such an epic song
I like pizza heads voice. It sounds cartoony and that fits his cartoony look
I like how the oven is a reference to the pizza tower mod handler pizza oven.
Can Gustavo and Brick get some love?
Lap 10
wait until he finds ptu...
To the final boss/pizza head/face
OMG ITS FINALY HERE
Everybody gangsta till Peppino becomes treat to entire multiverse
peppino eevee is something i didn't know i needed
Peppino is a .EXE?!!!
“Wait, haven’t we done this before?” He’s aware 💀
What in tarnation was that?!
wait... why is peppino's lap at the end 12/6/2023? WHAT IS HAPPENING AT 12/6/2023???
He's chilling until the war timer gets added
So...  quick recap: 1. afraid of losing 2. triying to prove he is not a coward 3. Losing completly his mind with the mods        i love this storyline
Nice Sonic.exe Reference at the end
Of course he'd get a Pinkie mod and bake the fourth wall. Friendship is Witchcraft always comes back.
peppinos villain arc has begun, now its pizza heads time to descend his own tower to shut down the pizza oven once and for all, before his tower is destroyed
Also I get it Baked sounds like breaked and you bake a pizza and this game is based of pizza so yea.
Dang peppino's not even scared, He just need the _L RANK_
10/10 pepperman voice
The song is short and hectic just like pizza tower ok maybe not the short part but you know what i mean... right? also MODS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
He finally became inSANE!
WERE GETTING OUT OF THE TOWER WITH THIS ONE 🔥🔥🔥
2:17 aeugh
"They called me mad, insane, Pepinno!" Not even in the song yet and the writing's already amazing.
Pizza face is my favorite character
If anyone is wondering why only Fake Peppino is happy about this, it’s because with Peppino never wanting to stop repeating laps, Pizza Time really will never end!
I like the jab at pizza oven being the 1-click mod installer for pizza tower
I love how he is just using a pizza oven like the mod installer pizza oven
lap 4? lap infinity? lap 10?
Would there be "SNICK IS COMING" or "Leaning Nightmare" w/lyrics?
Pepeevee is so cute
I love that peppino mods pizza tower with pizza’s it’s so cute
Me playing lap 3 and harder
"bake the fourth wall" friendship is withcraft reference
At the final, the lap is 1262023 So, 12/6/23 (6/12/23 for hispanics). It's something important?
Put it at 1.25 so the voices fit with the song
2:54 sonic exe reference.
The end make me dance
(I'm not trapped in here with you, you're trapped in here with me!) also, I love that all the mods peppino added were real mods, like: lap three, fight all bosses at once, and pizza tower as an evee.
we all need unexpectancy lyrics 1,2 and 3🤑
The fact that Pizzaface knows that the world has been modded implies that at least Pizzaface and Peppino knows they are in a video game
THE LAP COUNT IS A REFERENCE TO THE RELEASE DATE OF PIZZA TOWER, I LOVE THAT LITTLE DETAIL
Watching this again, I know realized something ironic. Pizzaface and Pizzahead put Peppino through Pizza Tower just to torment him. And now that Peppino's mind is gone, *he's* now tormenting *them.*
omg they leaked You Can't Run with Lyrics at the end! let's gooooooo
I love how all of the bosses interact and they are all confused and the end was amazing and I love how pizza face is concerned for peppino
Rank: SUPREME SUPER DUPER ULTRA P++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Pls make pizza tower unexpectancy with lyrics
INCREDIBLE!!!
I never knew about eevee peppino until now
Now do lap 4
1:40 Oh my god it’s a reference to pizza oven (the mod manager) cause of the god damn mods
PEPPINO in spanish is cucumber
oh phooey   so many-a mods, so little time.... W o u l d n ' t  Y o u  A g r e e ? ? ? what have i done.
Bro what da he'll?
1:55. OH NO PEPPINO IS A FURRY NOW
No snick?
Modded Pizza tower looks like hell good god!
HOW IN *_HELL_* DO YOU SING SO FAST?!
0:22
YES IT FINALLY COME WOOO
Make lap4
2:21  “IM NOT TRAPPED IN HERE WITH YOU YOU’RE TRAPPED IN HERE WITH ME” -Peppino 2023 and all other protagonists that end up gettin out of a antagonist’s trap and putting them both in it
this rules
Absurdism is a philosophy proposing that the world is irrational and meaningless. The conflict between the human desire for order and fairness in a chaotic and uncaring world is known as "the absurd." To be an absurdist is not to lament the meaninglessness of the world, but to embrace it and define your own meaning. To find satisfaction and contentment in embracing the capricious nature of the universe.  Sisyphus was cursed by the gods to push a boulder up a hill for all eternity, Albert Camus, the father of Absurdism proposes that his ultimate act of rebellion would be to turn his punishment, into purpose, an eternal purpose. "The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy."  We observe Peppino embracing fully the concept of the absurd, channeling the spirit of Sisyphus, willingly turning his punishment into paradise, finding meaning and purpose in the endless rolling of the boulder, or maybe rolling of the dough would be a more appropriate comparison.
Bro really Said Noise: is it time to crash peppino already?. AND FAKE PEPPINO IS BACK :D…. But don’t get me started on peppina and pepper man :D vigilante is here to :D And what the hell did that lap just say? But this was good really loved it all it’s perfect
oh phooey
Peppino’s addiction to challenge is like getting a tattoo once you get one you have to get more
THEY CALLED ME INSANE, CRAZY, My FULL GOVERNMENT NAME. BUT NO MORE LOL
This was really different from lap 2 and pizza time...
2:22 Why Th Is Peppino Holding A Pizza Cutter…    Oh No.
I noticed at 2:30, Peppino (Eevee)'s lap number was 1262023, put into a date format is 1-26-2023 which I think was when Pizza Tower released on Steam. Nice detail!
After seeing this, I wondered how Pepina Ramen covers would work. That or Sugary Spire's cover would turn out.
Like how the songs have gone from pizzaface trying to kill peppino to pizzaface questioning if peppino has gone insane from everything
LAP 4 PLS
WHAT THE HELL SO MUCH MODES AND WARIO IS HERE!!!!!
I liked how you added Peppina Ramen great video!
OMG LAP 3 IS HERE!!!!! LET’S GO YAY!!!!!!!😱😱😱😱😱😱
It's bad when you scare Pizzaface.
*lap: 1262023* peppino: is that-a so? pizza face: oh phooey.
1:55 WHO AREN'T YOU PEOPLE???
the fact he is using mods with pizza oven
Pizza heads voice was so good omg. "Oh phooey." XD pls do unexpectancy now bruh. Well either way I love whatever u make no pressure.
1:00 my favorite part AHH HAH HAH HAH! Peppino! You're mine! You've wasted far too much time On a simple jog to the exit door Wait... hang on Haven't we done this before? I dont understand whats happening now... I'm feeling even stronger, but how?! It's like the whole world Is rewritten to be- Oh, you gotta be kiddin' me... Did you mod the entire game? Just to up your chance to wind up maimed I don't get you, man! What's going on? What about Gustavo, Brick Stick, and John? Do you even have a single tie left To anything else but cheating death? That itty bitty ounce of concern aside.. If it's death you want I'm glad to provide
Ya'll really hit the sonic.exe reference. RecD, fam, homie, you're amazing. Some of the best content on the internet fr.
THAT WAS AWESOME
i think that the lap counter towards the end is a date! 12-6-2023? someone tell me if this is false or true.
Are we gonna ignore the fact that Peppino WANTED to be an Eevee?
Oh no        PEPPINO BECOME A FURRY
ok,that was the perfect pun,the "Pizza Oven"
Mod references: Lap 3/Lap Hell/Lap Hell Hotfix (Now known as Lap Hell Pizza Pursuit)/Egg’s Lap Mod/Overlapped/Any mod with lap 3, really Robotic’s all bosses at once Eevee  Pinkie pie Wario/frenzy worlds (?) pufferfish/PTO Peppina
Cant wait for lap 4😊
Yay Pizza Head finally spoke, also man I feel bad for that guy. Peppino went completely Ricotta Crazy
This is perfect. He is going insane but like he does it anyway, he doesn’t care what the consequences are anymore like I love this this this is a amazing like the best.
"So many-a mods, so little time-a... W̴̬̱͑ő̵̝̯̻̔͌u̸͔͚̟͠͠l̸̟͉̔̅d̸̙̹̑̃n̷͕͚̈̀͋'̶̬͖́̏̀t̶̹̰̊ ̵̳͗̉̈́y̸̺̗̻̏ơ̴̤͆͜ǘ̷͇̮̣̍̿ ̴̮̀̍͊a̵̱̪̫̓̓͐g̸̲͛͜ȓ̶̙̜̥̅̕e̴̛̹̙ͅè̸̡̗?̴͙̂"  Boyyy that Sonic.exe reference truly gave chills not only to Pizza Head, but the audience and fans as well
"I'm not trapped in here with you, you're trapped in here with me"  Never fails to crack us all up with that ending gag 😂 And indeed, the modding community not just made Pizza Face trapped with Peppino, but made him mad and even replaced him with Snick.exe and so much other alikes
Bro wanted to be crazy
this totally explains what happens when i get ahold of mods.
Irl pizza tower community
HOLY SHIT NEW RECD PIZZA TOWER SONG!!!
Peppino is going through a lot
This is the best one by far, pizza perfection!
"I'm not trapped in here with you, you're trapped in here with me"  Rec D never fails to crack us all up with that ending gag 😂 And indeed, the modding community not just made Pizza Face trapped with Peppino, but made him mad and even replaced him with Snick.exe and so much other alikes
This is fire.
I've claimed my within 24 hour award
the fact that peppino is on lap 1 million 262 thousand 23 makes me burst out laughing 💀💀💀💀
BRO YOU SHOULD DO LAP 4
Peppino shifting reality to have fun
This song not only just gave a great salute to the mod that started it all (Lap 3), but to others like the infinite lap mod and reskins like Wario, Pinkie Pie, Puffer fish, Peppina Ramen, Sonic, and lots more. Hats off to your creativity, RecD!❤
So many references packed in this song The pizza oven is a reference to pizza oven, the modding tool for pizza tower, then references all the reskin mods too. Then also a sonic.exe reference at the end with "so many mods, such little time.. wouldn't you agree?"  Probably another one i didn't get in there somewhere
Why lap 1262023? something will happen in 12/6/2023 x-x (i think)
THIS WAS ACTUALLY FUCKING FIRE
And we're still miles away from Unexpectancy, nice.
why does the laps say.. 12/6/2023 EDIT: is this  a code?
"Who need sanity when this proves, none of you can predict my moves, racing to this frenetic grooves, quick and fierce as can be!"  Again, it's the way how this fandom portrayed Peppino as an adrenaline junkie at his 40s
nice!
Just copy your ultimate level snakes
the fact nobody is talking about how peppino changed "enemycount=62" to "enemycount=620" yet there is no more or less enemies
1:58 Just look at Fake Peppino's face tho! He seems to be adored by the little Eevee Peppino has changed into. Cute yet funny there
The Forknight from the Lap 2 video seeing Peppino break the fabric of reality thinking it's because of him: 😳
0:41 peppino and that big ahh forehead
now all we need to do is wait for lap 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and the rest
"THE PIZZA OVEN MUST-A BAKE-A MOOOREE!!!"  Ahh that subtle reference to "Pizza Oven" Pizza Tower mod maker and CYOP. Plus it's also evident how this fandom really projected an anxiety-filled Pizzeria owner to be a lap-crunching fast runner maniac. Truly a love letter to the Pizza Tower community❤
this is literally just ptuce
I'm loving the references in this like bro really turned pizzaoven into a actual pizza oven
Make Absolute Absursiti (lap 4)
The mod creaton is a reference to pizza oven
When ever you can RecD Make Lap 4 and maybe Lap 5
This song hits harder🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lap 1262023. I see what you did there ;)
I love how they added the eevee mod to the mix
The scary part for me is the amount of mods im able to recognize
i love pinkie pies part lol
2:20 MOOOMMMM LOOK ITS MEEEEEE
"PEPPINO! YOU'RE MINE! YOU'VE WASTED FAR TOO MUCH TIME ON A SIMPLE JOG TO THE EXIT DOOR- Wait, hang on, haven't we done this before?"  Pizza Face questioning the many times he's been chasing Peppino is hilarious and on point 😂😂😂
This ins't the end of the laps... just 2 more laps... 4 and 5.
the fact that this is a video about lap 3 and this is also recd's 300th video
The eevee with peppinos voice is something i always thought the eever had,though a voice changer for the eevee part would have made sense because of the cutsom sound effects the mod comes with
Будет трек про "Bye Bye There"!?
“I’m not trapped in here with you, you’re trapped in here with me!”
Oh phoey he messed with too much mods
Pizzaface just desperately trying to figure out what Peppino has to gain from this
Fun fact: The lap 1262023 thing is a refrence to Pizza Tower's release date.
What about pizza scape
Alternate ending:I have baked the 4th wall! (Pizza face comes in) Pizza face: Uses pepinos 4th wall pizza: Peppino: sh_t
I really like how this song goes as far as to reference The Pizza Oven as Pizza Towers mod loader.  On top of that I find it really funny that it references (or at least heavily implies references) to PTUCE (Pizza Tower United Community Edition) with Lap 3,  Infinite Laps, Evee, Peppina, Wario, and Pinkie Pie existing in the same modset.  I live for the tiny things in these songs and those made me unrealistically happy as a deranged modder of the tower myself.
All we need is miller pizza tower mix with lyrics
type of my music during my power hour
OK at this point Puerto Rico's just gone insane
PİZZA OVEN YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES (the oven is a reference to pizza oven a mod manager and that oven ALSO references delta pachter)
Up the lap 4 is name absolute absurditi
Peppino hasn’t eaten in days that would break his combo
Too bad you can’t use multiple mods in PizzaOven…
I saw a refrance at the end of the video, when peppino did 1262023 laps you could see the date game was made (1-26-2023)
yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ain't no way he became eevee 💀
Peppevvee is born
The fact that Peppino said: “i’m not trapped in here with you. You’re trapped in here with me.” Just proves how insane and crazy this guy can get with his sanity
BRO PEPPINO JUST WANTING A CHALLENGE AND ABUSING MODS IS EVERYTHING
I liked the pizza oven reference
what a sekint peasa hed and cuphad have the same voice
i lost my marbles once peppino said "AS A EEVEE!!!!"
Up the lap 4
We need Unexpectancy part 1-3 with lyrics
imma ask to lap 4
Fake :\
I think we can all agree that Pizzaface, PepperMan, The Noise, and Fake Peppino 100% deserve this. They tormented and belittled this poor Italian man for no reason other than to just mess with him and now they all have to deal with the consequences. The only one I truly feel bad for is Vigilante. He was only protecting his home. But besides that, have fun Peppino!   You earned it… 😈🍕
god i love how its literally a pizza oven, like the literal mod manager
Ah phooey, here comes Peppino's villain arc.
Wait at the end why is there a date? ( its where it says lap 1262023)
Legend says that peppino is still running to this day. Also nice cover
I like that John Ghost acts like the last remnants of sanity in Peppino and wants him away of the oven. A very good WITH LYRICS, as usual.
GREAT!!!!!!
I thought this was just lap 3 not more flipping laps and mods
First time I've ever seen pizza face acknowledge something 1:00
Oh how the tides have turned for Pizzahead
Hes insane I would have gave up on lap2
Man you missed the chance to call eevee Peppino, peppveeno
I love how you put all the most know mod or reskin in the lyric just to tel how insane this community really is Btw the “as a eevee!” Really wasnt expecting and broke me up lol
i think its so fucking funny how at this point the way he's portrayed goes from like. "holy shit i have to get OUT of here" for pizza time, "there's something about teasing death that's alluring" for death i deservioli, and for the fuckin fanmade lap 3 song it's just "i've never felt so alive, i can't get enough of it" that fucking steady buildup to thrill seaking is kind of great. i can imagine after the end of it that's when the adrenaline wears off and he's just TIRED
now lap 4 it!!!
When you install 100 mods in a game
I love that he cooks a pizza in the oven, which is a reference to pizza oven the software that you use to add mods
Well that was fun!  Gotta love the modding community.  Hope they finish Peppina before I actually buy this dang game.  (Waiting for a sale.). Great song and lyrics pal!  Love how you portray Peppino as a daredevil more and more as he keeps winning stuff.
Pizza face is pogging in the thumbnail
They Called him PEPPINO!
Peppino has gotten to mode verinche
Pepper man. Vigilante!?
he did it, he fricking did themost popular mod from pizza tower and made lyrics
Peppino realized he is in a simulation in lap 2 and now he found a way to change it
I love How Pizzaface is literally concerned I also Love How the "Pizza Oven" Is Most likely a reference to the Pizza Oven Mod Launcher
Peppino are you insane!?  YES
This really shows our insanity as a fanbase Just making it harder for the heck of it
Peppino has officially gone mad
Pizzaface's first mistake:mess with an italian
now for lap 4 with snick
i love how fake peppino, out of all the bosses watching peppino turn into an eevee, still has that motherfuckin smile on his face
I love the fact the all the bosses are more scared then peppino was also great job and now peppino killed more people with mods
I thought the minus8 toppings would be there, THANK GOD THEY ARE NOT
Bro cooked up every mod just to master a course
I think this cover encapsulates the pure insanity and wackiness of Pizza Tower better than even "It's Pizza Time." There is not a single ounce of story left in this, all there is is pure chaos. 1:00 also PizzaFace's rap was the best part.
man did so many laps that it became the release date for pizza tower
LITERALLY IF THAT WAS ON MY 66 YEAR OLD COM IT WOULD EXPLODE
Lap 1262023? Hmm.. 12.6.2023?
I like how pizzaface is just concerned about Peppino's sanity
Now It's Peppino trying to caught the Pizza Face
Yea, Peppino, you've gone to White me and his Zamasu levels of insane
LETS GOOOO
Peppino has gone INSANE
I find it funny how pizza face just gives up on trying to catch Peppino
2:24 pizzaheads voice FINALLY got revealed
We need lap 4
Peppino's just insane after having to do all of the lap 2s and he wants more pain now. Thats what i see here.
...ok hes gone insane
“WHO ARENT YOU PEOPLE???”
I like that throughout all the laps peppino gets more and more exited. He went from being scared af to being like he was a god
it's nice to get this taste of what paperman, vigilante, and pizza head sound like in your world
i like how pizzaface is actually worried about him now
do lap 4 this time?
PizzaHead: Oh im glad all that was fake... eeppino:Is that-a so?
Fun fact: Peppino's final lap number at the end, 1262023, is actually the day Pizza Tower was released, January 26th, 2023. (1/26/2023)
I never have seen Peppino so cocky on my life bro
alternate line for the beginning  They called me MAD! INSANE! PEPPINO! they barred me from the pizzariea university until I had no choice but to conduct my cooking here! Well whose Crazy now MMM! Who MAD NOW HMMMMMMM!!!  if they went for the whole reference
IAP 3
It's so cool ,lab3
14 hours ago 😎
0:22 Peppino changed the enemy count from 62 to 620
2:30 is that a date?
My therapist: peppino as an eevee won't hurt you. Peppino as an eevee:
Fake peppino can talk reversed
BRO you are 0:12  peppino duh
noise:alright bet you white(his clothing) piece of shi-
Ah yes. CHAOS.
please tell me that the end is that mod that adds old peppino movesets like faceplant or chainsaw
Literally PTUCE:
Now make lap 4 >:) Edit:im not pushing you make wen you can
0:22
2:51 bro ain’t know way he referenced sonic.exe:spirits of hell
Snick:im not gonna appear in lap 10 now
Did Peppino fight 1 on 1 or did all of them fight at the same time? Cause I feel like if they did team up at the same time they wouldn’t have been turned into pizza toppin’s still my favorite pizza tower song tho.(even more than pizza time never ends) also does this count as Unexpectancy 3?
Hold on if you go in this time stamp 2:31 for the lap I think it’s a release date for something but for what?
lap 3= the ultimate death
Please do unexpectancy with lyrics
I Don't Know If This Is Itentational But..Pizza Oven Is A Actual Modding Place. As Peppino Does Say That The Pizza Oven Is Where He Gets The Mods, And Also Not To Say, And There Is A Actual Modding Place Called ''Pizza Oven'' So Yeah. That, I Think.
Is pepino implying that pipino isn't his real name?
What happened on January 26 2023?
I don't know if this was intentional but I find it funny that he's baking pizza to add mods because the thing most people use to load pizza tower mods is called pizza oven
-WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT????? +INFINITE LAPS!!! -Oh crap.... +WHILE FIGHTING ALL THE BOSSES!!!! -Ok....you're insane, but it couldn't get worse.... +AS AN EEVEE!!!! -....Now I have fear.....
peppino lost his mental insanity lol
0:11 but Peppino is your name.
I love how pizza head just rejects swearing and just says random words and also how his voice sounds like a 1990 tv commercial (also *PEPEEVEE* )
BRO COMBINED EVRY MOD ANd THIS MOD IS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love your songs.
2:30 was that an impotent date, the lap number Pepino is holding says "1262023" is that hinting that something is happening on "December 6th 2023"?
my man broke the matrix
THE LAP 3  THE LAP 3 IS REAL!!! CAN WE GET MUCH HIGHER SO HIGH
𝕆𝕄𝔾 𝕚𝕝𝕠𝕧𝕖 𝕥𝕙𝕚𝕤
RecD captured the essence of these songs perfectly. Lap 1 is fueled by panic. Lap 2 is fueled by confidence. Lap 3 is fueled by *madness.*
oh phooey 2:30
Peppino using mods while singing and defeating bosses is just the best thing ever
1:56 he turned himself into am Eevee. Funniest shit ive ever seen
2:22 IM NOT TRAPPED IN HERE WITH YOU *YOUR TRAPPED IN HERE WITH ME!*
Revenge of the killer pizza with lyrics, *PLEASE*
"ILL EVEN DO IT AS AN EEVEE!!!!" -peppino spaghetti
0:00 The legend it's real... 0:31 LAP 3!!! 0:41 Ghost John? i thought you were in the wasteyard 0:59 IT'S SHOW T- again? 1:19 Yeah! 1:29 FINALLY, THE EXI- wait, Peppino, what are you doing? 1:40 Peppino? 1:50 Wut? 1:51 ??? 1:53 Wait, i have to  make sum noise for the Noise? he always  says that we have to  make sum noise 1:55 Who's this guy? 1:56 Is this PTUCE? 2:02 What's happening? 2:21 Oh god. 2:24 AAH- oh it was a dream, i ever known that legend was fake 2:30 or... maybe... not... 2:31 thanks for watching! 2:51 END SCREE... ...
I don't what to think about this music, it's good and weird at the same time  The fact that peppino lost his anxiety and turn into a psycho makes me uncomfortable  What dould've been nice was that Peppino didn't knew what Lap 3 was and tried it but when he realises what is lap 3 and sees PizzaFace he begins to Scream while singing (The song is still fire)
FINALLY THE THING IVFEBEEN WAITING FOR
Ah yes peppino just pulling out mods like he should
just the oh phooey is calm subscriber +1 (just cuz you made this, i really wanted someone to do it) Start = 0:21 (sry for blinding you) End = 2:24
peppino is the god now
WAIT HANG ON THAT LAP FLAG AT THE END 1262023 1/26/2023 THAT WAS THE RELEASE DATE OF PIZZA TOWER
LAP 3!!!
my man is crazy
Very unepcted
Wow
is there going to be unexpectancy with lyrics?
I found the part where he activates the eevee mod very funny, just lap three as an eevee while a boss rush is happening with infinite laps, i would've found it cool if snick.exe would've also appeared
i also really like how they used pizza oven in it to
Fun fact: The amount of Laps peppino did at the end of the video is actually a date which reading the laps usually would be LAP 1262023, you can read it as 12/6/2023. This might be a date for when another song comes out!
What's this? The owner of a corporate monopoly showing genuine concern for the small independent business owner who's lost his mind?? Color me impressed!  Also the voices for The Vigilante and Pepperman make me excited for Calzonification and Pepperman Strikes
i love how you added the mods to
prediction: 1262023 is December 6th, 2023. Maybe a pizza tower vid is gonna come out on that date?
now do lap 4 with lyrics :trollface:
lap 4 time
Peppino.exe confirmed
Can you make lap 4 with lyrick?
WHO ARENT YOU PEOPLE?!
Peppino went insane what the
I want to suddenly this where is there any ghost pillar John singing
0:59 funny lap 2 reference
I honestly really enjoyed this song. I haven't seen a lot of your songs in a while but coming back to this one was great, especially the references to certain mods.
They called me Mad. insane. Peppino. Funniest stuff I’ve seen all week
Noise Said : Is It Time To Crush Peppino Already? HOLU SHIT GOT ME DYING
*Finnaly-a*
Peppino now knows how to bend reality. Pizzaface is done for
Beautifull
Can we have lyrics for all the level songs in the game?
Plz make rap 10 there is l rank
All the popular mods being in this is funny
finally you make a pizza tower song
Is this sonic.exe refrense?
This video literally got me into playing modded pizza tower. Amazing stuff!
2:30 12/6/2023
PEPPINO WENT COMPLETELY INSANE HE WAS ON LAP *1,262,023*
When pizza head say "Oh Phooey" made me laugh
It has been Out for 13 hours but if been listening to it 7 times
RecD got something correct We do call him peppino
I don't understand how you compose such fast lyrics for a song, so fast that I don't have time to perceive everything
fun fact: the number 1262023 at the end of the song when Peppino comes in Pizzahead's door is actually Pizza Tower's release date, January 26th, 2023
Ok,thats hilarious,"Who arent you people!?"
1:58 It's *your* fault, dude.
Peppino goes completely more insane. Oh, not only that, but he's basically asking to be killed.
todos los mods ay xdddd (que bien que no puso el de las toppings gals y pizzagal)
-... Was that a Sonic.EXE Reference at the very end with pizza head?
Peppino! Please... Just stop... I gave you everything you wanted.... Is it not ENOUGH?! You've summoned spirits.... Even someone you want to meet...
bro in a few months they will make lap 4 with lyrics (trust my words or 2 years)
i love how you poot all of the bosses in this video
WE ARE DOING LAP 3 WITH THIS ONE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣
YES FINALLY!
you perfectly catched the feeling of some mods feeling like fever dreams
If I had the power of that pizza oven, I'd probably do an easy mode challenge to start, if I can figure out how...   Invincibility  No combo breaks whatsoever  Lap 3  As...I dunno... peppinos paghetti?
That was so FIRE!!!
Nice Pizza tower is back! THIS IS INCREDIBLE REC!! I LOVED THE LYRICS AND ART! Also i loved how peppino just used mods. PEPPINO.EXE-
Lap 4 song next! Edit: The pizza oven peppino uses to add more mods is actually a reference to the pt mod installer called "pizza oven"
Lol you even referenced the Fem!Peppino mod! Though good on you for not mentioning a certain..... *other* genderswap mod. (You know *exactly* what I'm talking about.) The comment section would be as insane as Peppino is in this video if you brought it up.
bro you gotta do Absolute AbsurZiti (lap 4) The music is super good and I would love it
I wake up to this And even if this wasn't a joke This made my day This was a hit and halarious.  Edit: this second Pizza face solo is awesome.  Edit 2: Pizza Oven is the pizza tower modding comunity, so peppino used a "pizza oven" to get his infinite laps. nice little detail.
RecD gets to touch the mods and goes with a banger modded parody that even Pizza Face is confused, and with EEVEE I actually already tried both Eevee, Pinkie Pie, and Peppina Ramen...now it's time for NiGHTS
I like to think that everyone judges Peppino for being a character who shows anxiety but also can get out of hand sometimes
Can you make peppino vs pepperman plz
2:22 😎
2:52 O-O
This slaps harder than peppino in expectancy part 3
oh phooey
Thanks for lap 3
Who needs sanity when you can warp the world with the right toppins
Wow he hacked his world
2:56 now lap 4
Peppino! You’re mine! You’ve wasted far too much time on a simple jog to the exit door wait hang on havent we done this before? I don’t understand what’s happening now I’m feeling even stronger but how?! It’s like the whole world is rewritten to be- Oh you’ve got to be kidding me. Did you mod the entire game just to up your chance to wind up maimed?!  I don’t get you man what’s going on? What about Gustavo, Brick, Stick and John? Do you even have a single tie left to anything else but cheating death? That itty bitty ounce of concern aside… If it’s death you want I’m glad to provide.
Wow now pls lap4 cover pls
i dont really like what peppino knows about mods i mean in game's world they are not existed so peppino cant know about them plus he is not  type of character who can break a fourth wall so more logically would be if player makes peppino to throught a modified pizza tower
Eevee pepino is adorable Just want to put that out there
The eevee mod caught me off-guard. XD
Bro pepino went crazy
....
0:09 It’s Dr Mystico from Freakazoid! Played by the unhinged Tim Curry! Perfect fit.
He has Bended reality
2:22 - 2:24 my fav part
Well...that definetly didn't go the route I was expecting it to go..but still a nice twist since there are so many mods now.
Peppino found something more powerful than pizza head, THE MODS
I f8nd it kinda creepy that aside from the pufferfish Ive seen mod review videos on every mod peppino used to fuck with everyones heads Also rip pizza head No way he survived eeveeno N
Why is 12/06/2023
This…This is my FAVORITE VIDEO OF YOURS YET!!!
Hol up is the lap 1262023 is a reference to the relesse date of the game
Guys he’s on lap 1262023 does that mean something’s coming out on December 6 2023
Now do crumbling tower of pizza with lyrics
Peppino looking zesty as fuck in the title
Pizza tower insanity mod also pls tell me why fake Peppino is blushing at the pat final scene?
Pippeno has officially gone insane
With this song RecD also recreates whole PT community purgatory about lap hell instead of playing og game lap hell as fun as difficult as challenge it sounds at all
How about doing a LAP 4 lyrics, it will be cool like Ron🤔🤔🤔
Well, you know what they say: Who the heck puts vanilla on pizza?
WHY HAS PEPPINO DONE 1,262,023 LAPS?
1:52 peppino becomes Eevee
As a proud affiliate of Vozaxhi thank you for this scrumptious creation
Oh phooey.lap 4 is next innit ?
Is it just me or does the lap at the end make the date 12-6-2023 or 1-26-2023 (1-26-2023 is the date the game came out)
this is a MASTERPEICE! literally a couple of days ago i was like 'hmm i hope recD makes lyrics for lap 3, that would be awesome!' and now you have done it well done!
Pitino has gone mentally insane
I like how pizzaface knows Peppino modded the game. Almost like it’s happened to him before.
1:14 easter egg
is that so (Peppino, lap 1.2 Million)
Please one cover but Sugar Rush with Lyrics of Sugary Spire please. Recd
I liked the end part when he said a phoowy
This is Peppino’s canon event of spiraling down into madness
This song represents the lap plus mod, which is cool
Wow this so great
peppino sgetti
The fact that you even captured the fucking LINE THICKNESS OF THE EEVEE MOD. AND I CAN *RECOGNIZE THAT*
Can you try owl house
if you didn't know, "pizza oven" is a pizza tower mod launcher
lyrics of lap 4
0:05 huh completing tutorial faster let peppino's creativity cook lap pizza portals? That explains a lot
Peppino getting revenge now lmao
They must have a laper mod.
0:02 peppino almost done with the pizza 0:06 pizza its ready 0:22 peppino singing 0:28 peppino change enemy count 0:31 lap 3 started 0:41 john gutter sing  0:46 john gutter span enemys 0:59 pizza face laugh 1:00 same part from lap 2 1:04 pizza face getting stronger 1:29 john gutter sing again 1:39 peppino bake more more more pizza  1:46 peppino want infinite laps 1:51 all the bosses spawn 1:57 peppino turn into a peppeevee 2:12 peppino turn into wario 2:15 peppino turn into pinkie pie 2:17 peppino turn into a fish IDK 2:19 peppino turn into her sister 2:24 pizza head awak from a dream 2:29 peppino change into a peppeevee and have 1262023 2:29 secret code new video at 12/6/2023 2:31 outro
Well lap 3 is a mod.
Next lap 4
therapist:Pepeevee isn't real, he cant hurt you. Pepeevee: 1:58 Edit: when Pepeevee says "is that so?" it says he's on lap 1262023, that lap number is a calender date (i'm pretty sure) and the date is 12/6/2023
PIZZA HEADS VOICE IS MUGMAN
bro i thought that when peppino turned it a eevee i thought it was a joke but it's not
Need lap for now
*”AS AN EEVEE”* 💀
Me watching RceD:😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
WE HITTIN LAP 1262023 WITH THIS ONE🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🍕🍕🍕🍕
FINALLY LAP 3 WITH LYRICS now we waiting with unexpectancy 1-3 part with lyrics. wait I GOT IT peppino broke the fourth walls and used pizza oven for the mods!
I WANT ABOUT LAP 4 LYYRICCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC!!!!!
This. Is. Perfect.
I like how it perfectly describes the feeling of modding pizza tower with pizza oven
i like how at the ending there's an actual date "january 26th 2023"
No, it’s so cool about this. They made him a eevee and that’s just insulting of the entire bosses because he’s technically beating them as an animal showing his disrespect in the amount of suffering, he’s about to give them
1:59
I love for lap3 now best song in pizza tower
2:15 Hi Pinkie Pie
The PizzaOven Mod Manager being an actual PizzaOven was amazing.
I hope that you make unexpectancy
i was surprised he does a lap 3 cover
That's I in mod I beat pizza face woag
PTUCE:
This rocks🎉🎉
When Pepino Holds The Lap Sign Is The Release  Date Of The Game January 26 2023 Just Wanna Tell People
EPIC
peppino being wario in that one scene at the end is so accurate because pizza tower is based on wario games
Nice
As someone who loves pokemon i love the eevee part
I Love how in the thumbnails pepinno slowly becomes mmore dominant and crazier the pizzas representing the mods was amazing and peppino going insane was too pizza face is next probaly
Plot twist: none of this is real
and now we are waiting unexentancy 3
2:17        AEUGH
In the beginning the peppino is preparing a mod in the oven or a pizza
Nah bro he called gerome john
WOW
we are in a endless loop
2:30 the peppiivee showed lap 1262023… 12/6/2023 is a holiday, at least in germany, maybe europe. What, is RecD giving a clue??
That was perfection
I mean…they had it coming. They are seeing the what happens when a man is pushed to his limits.
Peppinos paghetti!
lap 1262023 was SO close to being a refernce to when the first pizza tower song with lyrics came out cause it came out 2-26-2023 it was on e number of of being a refence
now the only thing left is extreme laps this one is in Nick's pizza time V2, an addon for sonic robo blast and reached when you have 120 rings to go for another lap beyond 3, theres also nicks tower of pizza pack. yes the same creator i know all of this because i worked for the mod
is pepino now a god?
not sure if it was intentional, but i love that peppino manages to access these mods from a pizza oven, which the pizza tower's mod manager is literally called pizzaoven bravo, recd
He is crazy
Unexpectancy with lyrics when tbh
Peppino has officially lost his mind, all because of that last Toppin'
i hope lap 4 is next, great music video!
so cool so cool so cool also I love how peppino is making modded pizzas to access this stuff, you know, with a PIZZA OVEN, THE GAME'S VERY OWN MOD LAUNCHER.
I like how the lap Peppino is on in the final shot is the date of Pizza Tower's Release, nice detail.
Hey recd forgot to do the song of pepper man and vigilante
EV is furrie
If you pause when he has the lap counter it says 1262023 you think that means something
mod song
There is a mod named finale lap.try listening to the OST.
I love pizza tower mods
Okay, the references really show the amount of work you put into this. Not just the excellent vocals, sound mixing and writing but also looking around the community for actual mods. You deserve all the praise you get.
Can you please do Pepper man next
Nada más le falta la vuelta 4 que es contra el heriso morado
GIANT SENTIANT PIZZA HUMANOID THREATAINS TO BLOW UP ITALIANS PIZZARIA INSTANTLY REGRETS IT AFTER being trapped within a time loop with mods that fracture reality itself and forces him to run eternally by the command of said itallian
Lap 4 coming soon...
Una obra maestra echa en cancio,juro que cuando lo escuché termine llorando de la emoción cuando la lescuche
I'm just waiting for the ytp
Oh i get it hes using pizza oven
imagine if we got lap -1
we can upadte lap 4
Every Boss: OH GOD, PEPPINO FOUND THE MODS
This entire song encapsulates how it feels to play PT mods
Yea yea the song's great and all but the pizzahead at the end caught me oof guard, somehow he sounds exactly like i thought he would, it's so fitting!
Her: he's probably out cheating on me Meanwhile, me bending reality:
some one is tired
i loved it
i love how peppino literally bakes the mods (and this is a referese for pizza oven its basically were you install the mods
the eevee point caught me waay off guard jesus
I like how the title card flips the dynamic between Peppino and Pizzaface. In It's Pizza Time with Lyrics, Pizzaface is looming over Peppino, who is clearly panicked. Here, it's the opposite. Peppino is looming over Pizzaface, who is clearly shocked. It really adds to the whole "Peppino is the boss now" vibe that the song demonstrates.
I think the things making mods being a "pizza oven" is refrecing the thing most people use mods for on pizza tower that is litterly called "pizza oven"
The idea of doing a lot of mods at once is so good, and we actually got a scene of a vigilante voice actor leak, and a pepper man one
well I certainly didnt expect this
As an Eevee... Was thst a Sophist reference?
THIS IS THE BEST WOOOOOOOO
You can just tell by the lyrics that the pressure has mad him insane making him create a hell for himself and everyone else to be driven to insanity
I love how peppino doesn't even acknowledge john
" AS AN EEVEE "
True title: “Peppino’s revenge, lap 3-1827297 Cover”
I like how this doesn't only reference the lap 3 mod, but many other mothers well!
what if the spawner mod was here
cool😊😊😊😊

🎉 wow is super  cool
Can you do lap 4 two
We making out with the pizza universe with this one🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Lap Number™ (at the end of the song) is 1,262,023.
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FIRE! 🔥
mods 💀
Why does the phrase:so many mods to play with so little time dont you agree? Reminds me of sonic.exe's so many SOULS to play with so little time DON'T YOU AGREE?
they say peppino is still an eevee to this day
The final with "sonic.exe" meme to end the loop songs
Please Can you make  a song for " crumbling tower of pizza "?
Oh pizzaguy yk what time it is
OMG recd is back
Can do you unpectancy
The Fact he's using a pizza oven to make new lap portals. And activate mods or something. it is kinda pointing to a application called Pizza oven that can mod pizza tower like Multiplayer, Playable Characters, Idk.
Bro u couldn’t had one where he was pizzel or whatever the main character’s name is or the noise version in sugary spire
2:30 pizza tower on steam release date?
Realy
I enjoyed it
It's gooooooooooooood thanks
Modding in a nutshell
EEVEE!!
This series just follows Peppino descend into madness and ascend into godhood.
i am going f###ing insane
Peppino feeling all high and mighty now just wait until he reaches lap PI
Thank goodness all that stuff was fake... *peppino spawns* IS THAT SO? Oh phooey.
This one is good
Can have unexpectancy next pls???
Chef eevee
So much mods
i also love how you rafiend all the most lates charater swap mods for peppino xD
FYI in the pizzaface segement in the death that i deservioli it's "Peppino! You're mine! You've TAKEN far too much time", not you've wasted far too much time, but idk if it's intentional, or just a messup.
Peppino has gone mad with the pizza oven
People are surprised Eevee got mentioned (whether they knew it was a full character mod or not), and it shocked me too... but what was more shocking was that _Pinkie Pie_ got mentioned. That full-character mod's only been released for a few days!
Pizza tower fans realizing they can mod the game
HES INSANE, SOMEONE STOP HIM Once the lap 4 comes, he's gonna be the villian Of The year
ive been making jokes about this since lap 2 with lyrics came out and its actually real!?!?!
NOW LAP 4 (jk)
I love the fact that peppino turn into eevee,wario,pinkie pie,puffer fish, and peppina. reference to the mod
Wait wait? He's on lap 1262023. How the f*ck has he done THAT MANY LAPS
I know what we're all waiting for... The elusive Pillar John's Revenge With Lyrics YTP! I don't know how to help ya with finding it tho. Also i feel like the average scoutdigo player still needs Revenge Of The Killer Pizza with lyrics.
please do pepperman next
He just went insane also at the end he said the thing from Juno’s sonic .exe with lyrics
AS AN EEVEE!!!!
GUYS! REMEMBER DECEMBER 12TH 2023!! IT MAY BE IMPORTANT!!
Lap 1262023: Pizza face, John Ghost, Snick, War timer, Fake Peppino chase, Pizza Head bossfight, also Peppino is 96 times slower, Enemy counts are triple, 25 custom dragons are chasing him, Angry Gustavo is watching his every move, A duplicator of every gimmick including itself, Sonic.exe Bossfight, Random grbbie hands appear randomly, King Ghost spawns random traps and uses them, Noise throws bombs, A crushing hammer sometimes crushes him, Toppin monsters appear, Textures, versions and quality randomly changes and Finally, Henry Stickman randomly makes the game crash.
If RecD made unexpectancy 1-3 with lyric. It's will be epic.
I just realized why mods are pizzas that come out of the oven: Pizza Tower's mod loader is called Pizza Oven! I fell really stupid
I’d would love to see how you could do for stuck for eterlioni or anti pizza
hi
...I'm blown away by just how much thought was put into this.  This... This is...    RANK: *_[P^2]_*
We wait YTP
PEPPINO AS AN EEVEE IS TOO CUTE I CAN'T-❤
I love this so much The fact peppino literally baked the 4th wall allowing access to a MODDING TOOL (Pizza Oven) To then toy with Pizzaface's mind and confuse him is actually so funny imagine being Pizzaface "What the hell is going on here?! I thought I was the one to scare him but him doing this is scaring ME"
lap 1262023.......... 12/6/2023  whats happening in decemember?
i understood all of the metaphores after the video so started bursting out laughing when he randomly said "as an eevee" out of absolutely nowhere
Lap 3 (million)
Litterally ptu community edition
Now waiting for absolute absurzity and maniac pasta
Peppino’s villain arc
TLDR: Peppino becomes literal god
Peppino turning into Eevee, Wario and Pinkie is just so wonderful to see
As an eevee? Say about like 750 calories max
I want these to never end
Is it a pizza oven because the mod launcher is called pizza oven as well
bro broke the 10th wall 💀
Are you doing a pepperman song and a vigilante song
Basically Pizza oven is a application for modding pizza tower so thats why he is a using a pizza oven
They become more mad!!!
at the end of the music is a date witch is 12/6/2023
i want lap 4 pls
Peppino became puffer fish💀💀💀
Yep, that’s pretty much when you first try lap 3 you just go mad with unlimited power
Fun fact: this tumbnail is a refrence to its pizza time.
WHY DO ALL OF PIZZA FACE'S VERSES SOUND SO GOOD?
2:52 The fricking sonic.exe reference😂😂😂
Just saying, every mod peppino used here is real, so someone could make a mod pack with all these mods he used
i just realised the lap number when pepeevee barges into pizzaheads house is the release date for pizza tower, i find it funny
wth is this 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I love that Pizzahead's bed is a pizza.
This video is amazing
OKAY DOKEY TIME FOR ABOLUTE ABSURZITI LAP 4
It would be cool if you did lap 4
I'm new to this I don't think there is a pizzatowerfan ytp yet!
when your fanmade song is so good it get's it's own fanmade remake
The fact that peppino isn't even afraid but he's going insane just to prove that he's capable of beating the tower is relatable to me somehow
Lap 1: Scared, but willing to do what must be done Lap 2: Determined to be perfect Lap 3: Lust for beyond perfectness
(Visual confusion)
The number at the end can't just be a coincidence-
PEPPINO.EXE REAL AT THE LAST PART?!?!
BREAKING NEWS - random fat Italian man builds a pizza oven and destroys the whole world
"What have I done?!" Released a horror know as pepinno.
RecD, Theres a playable noise mod, i dare you to play it.
Cant wait for lap 4
My literal infinite Lap experience EDIT: Reminds me of the EXE "Lapper"
This makes Peppino seem like he’s just forgot why he even came to the pizza tower
pls do 4 lap plsss
dang, this shows that peppino wasnt just saying "should i go for lap 3" to rhyme with something.
the trilogy is complete
1:38 That's an amazing referense to the way you mod the game lol
1:58 Peppino fursona reveal
*ah fuey*
The definition of Pizza Tower Mods.
Peppino then comedically died by slipping on a bannana peel 1 to many times
How about making lyrics for this: https://youtu.be/gzF2a233GRU  Lap 4: Absolute AbsurZiti
I thought lap 3 wouldnt make scene but you made it
;y'g';\'jj-j0h\j0}h{}\o\\jnp
I like how you added that mod in there
Yeeeeeeeeeeesssss I've been waiting for this song
a reference to Pizza Oven The Pizza Tower Modding System
Peppino haa gone senile💀
12.6.2023? what is this?! or this is lap 1262023 and will be soon TORTUROLLINI PARMESCEPTION?  edited: i understood 1st february 26th of 2023th. release date "pizza time with lyrisk" well done author with a riddle🎉👍👏
Legends say the song was finished months ago but recd just couldn’t do lap 3
0:21 the song starts 2:24 pizza head wakes up
Well... At least we technically got vocal teasers for Calzonification and Unexpectancy via Vigilante and Pizza Head (assuming those two songs are on the chopping block). ... My god this was all kinds of madness.
Bro peppino got possesed by exeller Because he said almost like a:SO MANY SOULS TO PLAY SO LITTLE TIME...WOULDNT YOU AGREE? But he said:so many ahmads so lottle time...WOULDNT YOU AGREE?
Eeveee!!  Peppeevee is such a mood and I love him~
This is the best description of what's going on with the pizza tower fandom right now.
the enemies were so concerned about peppino’s sanity even pizzaface isn’t acting evil or malicious
2:30 This is how much you need to play to run so many laps?!
1:58🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥                                                                                                                              You've lost your mind.
Your fans have been asking you for this for a long time... The wait was worth it 🤣  Excellent work RecD 👍
THIS IS FIRE
this is litterally everyone using pizza oven.
where is the lap 4? And why did he Download PizzaOven?!
Sad that he misses the randomizer mod
After countless laps done by the hu- I mean, Mr Peppino, Pizzaface decided he would do his own countless lap run to overpower Peppino.... ...... But Sans was already aware of that plan.......
Peppino is insane and he is Pizza Maniac 💀💀💀
YOOO YOU LISTENED!! THANK YOU
Now Lap 3 music is canon.
I knew this would happen
I love how Peppino says “so many mods so little time wouldn’t you agree?” As Peppino.exe, well a new .exe that I’m allowed to bash with has arrived.
no way
I like the fact that the oven is Pizza Oven. A pizza tower mod manager
I LOVE HOW YOU INCLUDED THE EEVEE AND PEPPINA MODS INTO THIS! I really enjoyed all of this, it was a crazy ride!
Johns Voice actor did great I totally heard every word he said over the blaring instrumentals and Peppionos psychopathic singing
never thought an overweight chef could run this fast from a horrendous pizza face chasing him
This is genius, great work.
Lap 4 when?
H e s  t h e  b e s t
Its here.
U BROKE IT!!!  Peppino. You broke peppino.
I'm waiting for Peppino to He will become insane and will speak Russian, Ukrainian, Brazilian, Italian and other languages.
How does Peppino have the dedication to do 1,262,023 laps?
peppino lost his mind gosh and if there more peppino i think the other character would just cut the music and walk away
What????
Cool
I mean this one Is okay but I'm not saying it in a more in a "I don't find this like the other songs".
My lord. That Pinkie Pie mod came out like two days ago, and it's already being featured in videos. Peppino's strength is reaching omega critical levels.
lap4 music next pls :) here is the music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzF2a233GRU
the next video after lap 3: Peppino's Intervention WITH LYRICS by RecD
Peppino=insane
lol you used mods for this song btw banger
YESSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHH LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Pff! I notice The clock is Pizzaface also the crazy looking eevee at the end, perfet
Oh cool, Pizza Tower cover on my birthday, what a way to start it.
WHO ARENT A YOU PEOPLE
I was expexting unexpentancy but this is also cool
Even the pizza tower creator himself couldn’t get to lap 1262023💀‼️😭🔥🐓 ( 2:30 )
Wait... does this mean Pokémon exist in the pizza towe-- no, not gonna go there
That pizza face rap was an instant P rank
Man this song was fire !
People when they try to use all of the mods they can find at the same time
2:51 I love the sonic.exe reference
Pizza Face pigging in thumbnail summoned me to watch the video
Unexpectencey when
Wow
This was my idea in the frst plase but I'm beaning not mean I'm Just saying tho
1:59 Fake Pep could transform into Ditto like in the mod
so.. nobody's gonna mention that peppino's current lap could represent a date? like 12/6/2023
Иви :>
FINALLY THANK YOU SO MUCH
Would be nice if he had transformation giver mod
I knew in this video, Peppino would be f*ked up, and he was, just not in the way I expected.  Best Lyrical video regarding Pizza Tower youve ever made.
Because John ghost appears, I think you needed to do this on wastyard
FNF music sucks, but Pizza Tower lyricals and originals are 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Recd needs a raise i dont care what will happen
Wait until he finds out about CYOP...
Pizza tower fan get to it
Wasn't expecting Lap 3 wow I love this
Eevee, ye eevee is here! So enjoy 😊.
Snick is coming
Why did Papino turn into a furry?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🦾🦿🦾🦿
THE ENDING PEPPINO.EXE Ngl he’d probably kick Sonic.EXE’s butt.
2:30 *Gasp* He said the line!
YOO
i think the ending will be the most replayed XD
I love how instead of Pizza Face being the biggest part of the thumbnail. Peppino is, showing how much courage and power he’s gained. Showing who’s more dangerous
Дождались
Bro like a week I can finally buy pizza tower, I downloaded pizza oven, and, god, I feel exactly like Peppino LMAO
Is there a upcoming lap 4 lryics?
do lap 4, ABSOLUTE ABSUSUZITI
HOLY COW ITS PERFECT
Just a suggestion, do Absolute Absur-Ziti (Lap 4) with lyrics.
Took me a while to realize that the mods are coming from the PIZZA OVEN
Finally
Lap 4  with Snick?
I love the idea of Peppino not being anxious, mad or anything now, just him saying “pizzahead mess with me, SO I WILL MESS WITH THE WHOLE FREAKING REALITY”
Peppino became pokemon and chose eevee ?????    ?    ?  ?           ?     ?   ? ?              ?
Imma be real with you the lyrics got better but the art style got worse also could you just move on to unexpectancy 1-3
Patafoin's Eevee Pizza Tower mod :0
LAP 4 CONFIRMED?!  Its shown at the very end of the video
He's lost his mind
Amazing work bro
This is-a masterpiece, i-ms looking for it like infinity
POWERFUL SCHIZOPHRENIA
I’m lot gonna lie this was fun to see peppino messing with mods
This video could have been called: “Peppino and Walter white cooks pizza (and Peppino eats it)”
The part when he said as an eevee really got me imagine getting outrun by a speed state 55 eevee
But code Pizza tower not really hack but mode Lap 3 but... Cameo all mods Eevee, MLP, peppina    cool cameo
OK I got an idea, hear me out:  *Thousand March with Lyrics.* I don’t care how long it takes.  Also: Peppino’s gone mad with power thanks to discovering the modding scene! My God, someone needs to save this man from himself!”
I hate this one even more, peppino just sounds and feels like a complete A hole, completely not what the game entails you.
Damn pizza Face is concerned
RecD, the lap 3 music was seriously my favorite modded song in pizza tower mods, you making with lyrics? This is the best thing ever
Reeeeeee
I like the subtle lore RecD's been dropping in the main level music songs by showing Peppino's slow decent into madness.  In Pizza Time, he's freaking out over EVERYTHING, but is still primarily worried about the main plot: Pizza Face blowing up his restaurant.  In Deservioli, he's becoming more and more paranoid, but also determined to get a P RANK, no longer caring about the main mission and seeking the satisfaction of the purple P.  And now, in Lap 3, he's become so obsessed with the simple THRILL of the last two laps that he resorts to BREAKING REALITY ITSELF to gain said satisfaction for eternity. Borderline psychotic behavior.   Anyway, awesome lyrics yet again RecD! XD
Imagine making a concept lap 3 song and it officially gets covered by Rec himself...
I was sleeping with my gmax eevee plush rn and the whole eevee inclushion part left me laughing.
we got our first look at the voices of peaper man and vigelante
I won't lie- I did NOT expect the song, or rather a lap 3 + mods cover, but not Peppino (Eeveeno?... Pinkie... eh you get the idea.)  But Peppino's insanity after so much fits the rythm of the song so well! It's been an amazing job and amazing song!
*DAMMIT I COMPLETELY FORGOT TO WORK ON MINE.*
Banger
WE NEED UNEXPECTANCY NOWW
Didn’t expect this to come out now for some reason
Nah bro really turned into evee 💀
*epic*
Pov:Me after getting my hands onto the pizza oven mod manager
How it looks like when you download mods for pizza tower:
Peppino is just messing around with the mod manager; I wonder if they'll run into Pizza Tower United.
Also the voice of pizza head-
He hasn't even fought pizza head yet
lap 1262023: you have unlocked every boss fight on time crunch mode
It’s perfect.
They should've called it your secret isn't safe with me.
nothing could have prepared me for Peppino eevee to have the same adult Italian man voice as normal
I’m invested let’s hear what lap fours song sounds like with the purple porcupine.
Maybe MatPat's theory on pizza tower was right.
2:19 i hate you. :)
I was expecting to go into this thinking Pizzaface was going to be the main focus but NOPE. Peppino's lost his mind. Just incredible.
HOLY SMOKES, RECD! This was perfectly insane in all the best ways! Haven’t gotten into the Pizza Tower modding scene too much, but the raw, unbridled desire for a bigger and more hellish challenge is absolutely contagious! Between the enemies’ frightened disbelief and Peppino’s manic rapping (the you’re trapped in here with me bit was GOLD), it really does seem like the facets of reality are falling down like Dominos 😉!  I also take specific interest in Pillar John’s backing vocals. They seem so…haunting, even if Peppino dominates them in terms of acoustics. It seems like he conveys the terror of what’s going on even more than Pizza Face! He was the literal and figurative cornerstone of what the tower is, and now it was stripped away from him to satisfy Peppino’s wishes, leaving him wondering what has become of the once anxiety-filled chef. It really does seem like Peppino is becoming more of the villain more than Pizzahead, especially with that foreboding post-credits scene. We haven’t even gotten to a final boss (whatever your CC-free version of Unexpectancy might be, should that come to fruition), and it seems like Peppino has already won, but at what cost? His friends, who are currently mysteriously absent? His sanity, replaced with the urge to repeatedly torture and kill his foes? Is that what Pizza Face meant by that what Peppino wants will be what he never wanted back in Lap 2?: the world around him completely gone, destroyed by Italian rage, except a hollow restaurant and the shell of what he once was?  Maybe I’m reading too deep-dish into this. But I am super excited for future Pizza Tower songs, and for future content altogether! You guys are keeping the hype train going! I hope all is well with you, and thank you so much for another awesome song!  Edit: Thank you all so much for the likes! And thank you for the heart RecD! It means a lot!  AH PHOOEY. Forgot the heart disappears when you edit. 😭
The lap number in the ending... 1/26/2023... it's definitely a date... either that or 12/6/2023... there's some shit involving it, I fucking know it... but what?
This man is a straight up maniac
This is honestly really funny and sounds great, also peppino eevee is so funny lol
Finally! Now my cousin stop of asking to me when will you finish this song
god no theres gonna be eevee peppino r34
HE IS INSANE
0:22 the start of the song
pepino turned into a pokemon😂
It got scarier by every mod
I want the FULL UNEXPECTANCY & Bye Bye There as the Final Round.
I love how in each lyrical video of pizza tower has Peppino loses his mind more and more. Such to an extent that he knows that he can mod the reality that he is in and turn him into other characters from different video games, t.v shows, or memes. Can't wait for the next vid to be Peppino having lost it so much he destroys every boss in dark souls. 😂
LAP 3 YOU MADE A LYRIC ooo can’t wait
Oh I get the joke about the pizza oven, the actual Mod manager for Pizza Tower is called Pizza oven, so it makes sense he's doing all this stuff with you guessed it, a pizza oven.
The song was hectic and Peppino is now a psychopath  The reference after the outro was funny and fitting and now I’m scared  Help
The Alternative Title: Peppino goes Mod Crazy
as someone who hasnt seen these kind of mods i gotta say: What.
The literature pizza oven was the biggest brain move
Peppinos oficially lost his mind
0:59,1:00,2:03
"Hey The Noise! Remember that time Peppino turned himself into an eevee?"
ITS TIME FOR LAP 4
Peppino just bought pizza oven mods
Make lap 4 this is good
Peppino went insane
One word Peppeevee
finally a new song! and it was 100% worth the wait!!! I love this, it's in your top 3 for me and I love how this shows how unhinged Peppino is    (also animé Peppinos Paghetti is something else)
I love it you should make more of these
And so peppino caused his villain ark by causing infinite laps causing suffering to the bosses
Quick rundown of the mods refrenced here (to my knowlage)  0:00 The Pizza Oven is a nod to the modloader; Pizza Oven, made by Tekka 0:20 Lap 3 is well, the Lap 3 mod made by Vozaxhi 1:46 Average Stupid Infinite Lapping Mod made by MosterSMTH 1:48 I’m not really sure about this one but it’s probably because bosses like The Noise and Fake Peppino keep appearing in those Lap songs you see on Youtube. If anyone can correct me on this it’ll be very much appichiated 1:57 The Eevee Mod made by Patafoin 2:12 Most likely Frenzy Worlds made by VanyaPlay206 (i think) because Wario is in there, or maybe it’s because Pizza Tower was inspired by Wario Land 4, or maybe I’m just looking into it too much 2:15 Pizza Party made by Peachy Pie 2:18 Your guess is as good as mine 2:20 Peppina Ramen made by ichrio51_bananna 2:52 I know what it is, but I prefer not to say it  Feel free to correct me on anything
1:19 Dah.
Pizzaface: Peppino… how many mods are you gonna be using?!?  Peppino: *Y E S*
1:12 You put Gerome instead of John, so either change the lyric from "What about Gustavo, Brick, Stick and John?" to "What about Gustavo, Brick, Stick and Gerome?" or change the icon of Gerome to an icon of John.  Edit: Why is Snick there instead of Brick.
The fact that Peppino used the sonic.exe words after he offs tails was amazing
Is the footage new or the same as lap two.
Create Your Own Pizza goes Crazy and same goes for modding-
I love the detail of the lap number shown at the end being the date of Pizza Tower's release. Goes to show how short of a time it's been since, to be frank, ALL of us have gone completely insane.  Pizzaface and Pizzahead's punishment for even thinking of provoking Peppino is so well described in the last lyric: "I'm not trapped in here with you, you're trapped in here with me!" and the payment is doled out in that aforementioned insanity like pippin hot pizza slices.
I always laugh when he says PEPPINO to himself
I loved the cameo from Plume the Eevee in this. 10/10
Crazy peppino
“Oh phooey”
Lap 4? 🤔
IT'S HERE!     This Peppino: Filled with madness and almost pretty much exploiting with mods. Other Result here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YJbHC5dGiI
Hey Recd I think you should make the pepperman boss fight or vigilante or pizza face boss fight  And I like your vids keep up the good work
peppino said fuck it if I suffer everyone has to too
since you like pizza tower so much, you'll be happy to know, someone is making a pizza tower FNF mod
Now do all Unexpectancy tracks
1:58 "... You've lost your mind."  Exactly what I think whenever I see all of these crazy, ridiculous, over-the-top mods. XD
thank you. for not having a toppin gals cameo. its truly amazing
Man he did not baked the 4th wall he overcooked it Edit: OOh only understand now that peppino gets mods trought pizza oven, pt mod loader
The pizza oven reference was so clever!
I was laughing on this song until he turned into an eevee
BANGER!!!!!!!!!
PERFECT!!
the song no one wanted, but what we needed
PinkiePino is AMAZING, NGL.
Lol it’s funny peppino fought as my fav mlp and Pokémon.
2:01 i like how he put mods
bro broke the fourthwall
PEPPINO GOT TOO POWERFUL
The last lines are beautiful. 'Oh Phooey'
Maybe peppino has gone too crazy...
You should've had peppino added CO-OP mode lol, that way there'd be two noises
I think Patafoin should see this
Anyone notice the reversal in thumbnail art? Peppino is now where pizzaface was and vice-versa
bro is the eve mod  1:57 😂😂😂
peppino must have spent hours playing the game if he is in lap 1262023
You gotta love how pizzaface is more so confused at Peppino’s shenanigans than eager or angry.  Also notice how when Peppino barges into PizzaHead’s room on top of the bosses, fake Peppino is knocked out cold. Even the eldritch horror couldn’t handle Peppino’s power
Oh jeez pepino has finally lost it pizza face/head what have you done?!
Oh ho ho? what's this? LAP 12/6/2023?
I like how they just made peppino an absolute mad man.
and peppino's gonna witness lap 4. snick.exe
2:52 man fr think hes sonic.exe 💀💀
Now, LAP 4.
I LOVE THIS
Ok but now we need a huge compilation of lap 1 2 and 3 Song 1 then transition into lap 2 song and then transition to lap 3 then end
"They called-a me mad…  Insane…  Peppino!"   That gave me a good laugh
Me when I have s rank:
John gutter is gonna collapse from this song
now do pizza tower united
Bro when is pizza tower fan making a YouTube poop remix
I'm just sad that there isn't gustavo and brick in this
1:43 The Pizza Oven, like the Modding Tool, I love this
Lap 3 is good now lap 4!
2:31 the fact peppinos is still a waifu while melted Rest in pizza, the superior version
Man, I wonder what new ytp will be cooked with this one...
Evee?! ( 1:56 )
You know it’s a good day when recd posts
Para cuando la cancion de Vigilante y Pepperman
No Andrew ketchup makes fury.
Peppino lose his mind over a mods
This was fire peppino cooked the perfect pizza
the fact he turns into an evee and just summons random beings from other fandoms or communities is gold
Ya just HAD to mess with the mans Pizza Shop-
This was great!
But peppino thats too much mods
The mods of pizza tower song
OH GOOD ARCEUS HE'S TURNED INTO SONIC.EXE
Сначала монах зделал 3 круг, и наконец то есть 2 версия
welp, time to learn how to fuse pizza tower mods-
When I saw Peppina, I Was SHOCKED! And the best freaking line in the whole: "AS AN EVEE!"
The song they forshadowedili
I stitched his lap 1 and lap 2 lyric videos together, now I want a lap 1 through 3 to listen to in order
Can you make lap 4 pls
Lap 4 when?
YEEEEEAAAAAAAAHHHHHH
Oh god that ending when the credits pop up
The “ im not trapped with you your trapped with me “ hits to hard
unexpectancy 1-3 when? also absolute banger and amazing art
12/6/2023
This is the 300th video!!!
EEVEE!!!!!!
All the references I could catch: Lap 3 PizzaOven Eevee over Peppino Pinkie Pie over Peppino Infinite laps Peppina Ramen Wario over Peppino it's all I could've caught
That ending part tho- it slaps too hard
Pizza time (lap 4) in real life  I went to class lap 1  I come home to eat lap 2 I go back to class lap 3  I come back home lap 4
EEVEE GANG🔥🔥
Lap 3 good
Geez! Chill out, Peppino!
What..... 12 6 2023......Are you making an awesome video on december 6 2023.....this year?
Like make a song about infinite laps separately
You should really do a song about the infinite lap mod, I really love your songs also
Awsome!  Edit: woah its better than me but idc is soooo cool music!
Anime girl peppino I thought I would not see that today 2:20
I Love This! It’s Friggin Amazing To See So Many Mods In One Video! Lap 3, Patafoin’s Eevee Mod, Boss Rush Mode, Wario, MLP (For Some Reason), Pufferfish, And Peppina All In One Video, God Damn. It’s Also Amazing To See That Pizza Oven (The Mod Loader For Pizza Tower) Is Referenced Here With A Literal Magic Pizza Oven That Can Change The World. Great Video As Always RECd! And Make Sure To Take Breaks, As I Know It Can Get Exhausting Making Content: The Art, The Vocals, The Subtitles And So Much More.
Less gooo another pt with lyrics by rec d
HOLY CANNOLI EVEE
Lap 3 theme is my favorite theme fan made AND NOW COME THIS GUY AND DOO IT BETTER WITH LYRICS
I've done the same thing as peppino!
Dude make pizza tower lap 4 lyrics
very-a good-a cover and I-a liked it I hope there's-a more to-a come in-a-the future!
2:11 the bosses hurt in the background as the next one is gonna get hurt
(spoilers for after-credits)     2:51 SONIC.EXE REFERENCE!!!!!
now we need lap 4
The fact that pizza face is genuinely concerned for pepino is great
Pizza face at this point is concerned
Peppino.EXE holy s
Welp, this must be the backstory of Peppino.exe...you know... endless hell.
Cool detail that I noticed:  If you look at 2:30, Peppi-Eevee has gone through 1,262,023 laps. If you look at the number as a date, it would be 1/26/2023, or January 26, 2023: the date that Pizza Tower was officially released to the public.  Great Easter eggs as usual, Rec. Keep up the good work!
WOW IT'S FINALLY HERE
I think Peppino's little "adventure" through Pizza Tower might've broken him.  Even Pizzaface seems concerned for his sanity!
Going off course but any chance you guys can do Hush from the binding of Isaac with lyrics?
I love the evee reference to what I honestly think is the best reskin of peppino and then I recognised the girl as the peppinos sister reskin
HES CRAZY, HE IS UNSTOPPABLE, THE P-RANK IS INEVITABLE AFTER 800 HOURS AND 578 DEATHS!
Yeah that sums up the pizza tower fan base in a nut shell
I got an ad for little ceasers
Are you going to do the lap 4 or this is the last one?
This describes perfectly Pizza Tower community, AND I LOVE IT!!!!  P. S: I love how he added Peppina, Eevee, Pizza Party, (a Peppino Wario reference), all bosses in a level mods, Average Stupid Lap Mod.
we need to stop calzonification with lyrics as soon as possible
Lap 1: wants a topping Lap 2: wants a p rank Lap 3: wants everyone to suffer (or just break the game)
Please create unexpectancy with lyrics
Pizzahead having a voice like an old-timey radio announcer, complete with tinny filter, is perfection. Absolutely great job; catchy AND hilarious.
Epic
AW YEAH, WE GETTING OUT OF THE JOHN GUTTER WITH THIS ONE! 🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥   In all seriousness, i'd love to see this grow into a series. You (and the team) do a very great job and you deserve any praise you can get. The pizza oven idea referencing pizza oven - a modding tool for pizza tower is crazy.          edit - cheese?
as i saw this, it was 3 hours ago and this is lap 3
Is so good bro more then pizza time
The lap count said 12/6/2023 so I think it’s a teaser for upcoming song (maybe the TRUE noise song?)
The pizza oven was a fun reference to the actual mod helper
There it is. That's it. I've heard people speculate about how making Peppino a villain in a sequel (or whatever other form of media) following this game would be a great idea. But not knowing the motivation. There you go. Wrapped up in a little bow. The motivation is this balding middle aged Italian man in the middle of a mid life crisis becomes an increasingly unhinged adrenaline junkie whilst trying to save his restaurant.  Being a mere normal pizza chef isn't enough for him anymore. He can't take it, he starts having withdrawal for his life being in danger. He needs more. More adrenaline, more speed, more death, more enemies, more obstacles, he *has* to push the limits far beyond they were ever meant to be. Pizza Face has created a monster. And he now has to right his mistake, if only cause his life is in danger of Peppino gets any more unstable with his reality altering spices he puts into these special pizzas.  Like I said this could work for literally anything. A sequel game. A mod. A fanfic. A online comic! All of those would work! I just need to see someone use this idea! This is at the very least the perfect idea for an AU.
WARIO TIME!!!
I like the fact that they added a Pokeball when they were doing the Eevee transformation
Now we just gotta wait for lap 4 with lyrics from this legendary man
Speaking of infinity laps, https://youtu.be/ONxD0pA6E20
Now we can expect Blue Licorice as Peppino is basically acting like Pizzano here.
Peppino has realized what he can do with mods, and now has gone fully insane, PERFECT LYRIC VIDEO!!! Edit: and some revenge from noise and fake peppino trying to kill him.
We need an O rank for oh god. And a Y rank for you are god now. OH NO.  how you get the O rank you need 100000-99999999 laps. get 1000000000+ and you get Y rank and for both you need P rank requirements. You will just have s rank until you get whatever you were missing
I didn't know we needed eevee pepino
I love pillar John's lines 0:41 "ohhh, Peppno, what have you done?" "nothing left to do but run" *"never planned to display my fury"* *"but your meddling ways have forced me"* 1:29 "ohhhh, Peppino the end's in sight!" "gooo, finish and set things right!" *"I'm so tired of spawning baddies"* *"wait you missed the door don't you wanna be free?"* I feel bad for him
Pizza Face isn't Peppino's nightmare, Peppino is Pizza Face nightmare, maybe Gustavo can help peppino craw out of this insanity arc?  1:57 The regret is there, but he doesn't have nobody more to blame that himself for breaking him and losing his mind xD
If theres a lap 4 song how will be snick voice and peppino becomed crazy with fresh mods
and why would peppino be a eevee in 1:56
lap 1 is anxiety, lap 2 is confidence, lap 3 is insanity
Bruh this peppino being a character makes me question if he’s not afraid of death how would he act if he faced overpowered characters like saitama or goku or super man or perhaps all might
...Peppino has straight up SNAPPED...and I love it!!!
2:29 I think this is a reference to the release date of the game (If so, what a really good way to show an easter egg👍)
Good...now do Absolute AbsurZiti
peppino's lost his mind lol
Can you do a FNF Peppino versus boyfriend mod?😂😂😂😂😂😂😈😈😈😈
OH YEA
i love how peppino is so insane because of everything he done, he mods the game and use it as a puppet to install mods that gives him more insanity.
and the 2:54 is VERY CREEPY
Peppino meddles with the dark arts and BECOMES WAIFU?!?! | Sad Story Part 2
YES MORE PISS TOWER SONGS!!!!
Mid alert
The freaking sonic.exe reference at the end funny cause technically, peppino could just change the code to make it become lap chair, lap door, lap peppino, lap lap, lap 1, lap e, and lap mrbeast. The idea of that is just hilarious.
1:58 Pizzaface could tell that Peppino was the threat, but then he went "AS AN EEVEE!" and he realized he's just got no sanity left in him
Bro just did 1262023 Laps Bruh is that even possible
Bro the game is ded I hope is going to be Pizza tower 2
I didn't expect Plume, Pinkie, That Dead Pufferfish Meme, OR Peppina to drop in this song, but RecD has always managed to subvert my expectations...
2:22 this is my favorite line
Well, he really did stay for lap 3.
Put Pino big is the fourth wall and you need a giant can’t Peppino make a giant pizza to fight pizza face😮😮😮😮😮😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈
nice sonic.exe ref right there
this song is PERFECT! he BAKE the FOURTH WALL, and proceeds to install MODS, and EVERYONE IS TERRIFIED also "Peppino, you're mine! you've taken far too much time for a simple jog to the exit door, wait... haven't we done this before?"
I love all the refrences in the song **Chef's Kiss**
Man became a maniac
peppino got revenge from make some noise
what would PEppino do once he found the create your own pizza mod..
LAP 4 últimamente
Pizza tower fan is gonna make another cool ytp again yay
It’s here!
Quisiera que hagas la cancion de lap 4
Well that was not a nightmare
Pizza tower united community edition belike:
How do you spell Pinot figure out he’s in a game.Peppino finally broke the fourth wall😮😮😮😮😂😂😂😂
Can you do bye bye there
im glad that pinkie pie peppino could be in this.
PIZZA OVEN REFERENCE?!? uh i mean, the app what can easily play mods
Bro pulled wario up and think we wouldn’t notice, Good job RecD
now we just need absolute absuziti. you know what to do, recd.
1:58 some of these lines are so deranged they loop back around to being genuinely badass
Anyone wanna see RecD do unexpectancy?
i know pizza tower died but this will never die for me
The lyrics are fire, like the oven. Also I think it's really clever that peppino doesn't install mods, but "Bakes" them.
Waiting for lap 4.
WE MAKING OUT ALL THE LAPS AND BATTLES WITH THIS ONE🗣️💯🔥
'I'm not trapped in here with you, you're trapped in here with me' I didn't know where you were gonna take that last jingle, but you made it work so well
now I wait for lap 4
wen you get a popular creator to voice over your fanmade song, thats how you know you made it to the finish
I think Bumbles McFumbles said it best: You ever stop to think that, maybe the people who have to invent new challenges just to beat them, shouldn’t be considered the standard for gameplay
Peppino:is that so?...   Pizza head:oh phooey
I just realized the lap number 1262023 is the date pizza tower came out
At least he didnt doenload the pizza toppin gals mod...
Alternative title: Pizza Face's nightmare
Pls do Unexpectency next!!!
you gotta make “absolute absurZiti.”
Please please RecD make lap4 with lyrics I will subscribe one hundred thousand trillion billion times if you make lap4  with lyrics
Refrence i found in this: peppinos mod oven is probably a refrence to pizza oven the mod manager
This was the best pizza tower with lyrics you ever done I thought it’s just gonna be lap 3 but no no no it was way more that I ever wanted and I want to talk about the four transformations I’m already seen Pepinos a girl and Evie Pepinos but I have not seen pinkie pie or the Wario or that  puffer fish and I also like did that fake Pepinos was also a girl I just wanted to say great job for making for us :)
How did he fail on lab 2 but not on infinite
Hey, uh... That banner Pepp-eevee is holding at the end... That looks suspiciously an awful lot like a date (either 1-26-2023 or 12-6-2023)...  What does this mean, Recd? _Recd what does this mEAN-_
seems like peppino took the line “should i stay for lap 3?” from previous video literally. i bet a few years from now i’m going to stumble upon this comment and find it cringey.
I love how pizzaface’s teeth/nose change when they’re speaking showing just how much Peppino has messed with the world
LAP4!
Peppino.exe🍕
huh lap 1232023 but just why
Well the next song is coming out of December 6th 2023
Pizza Boy should've think twice about doing something that'd enable Peppino's bloodlust.  Anyways, you should do Papa Louie with lyrics someday. That is a pizza game from our childhood constantly compared with Pizza Tower.
Okay…he is great at john pillar’s level though 😂
I was been waiting for almost random month
now you do lap 4. and have a rap battle with snick.exe.
2:31 Fake is still in his Peppina form, was Peppino so broken he made him stuck like that😅
This is every person that has pizza oven
me encanta tu trabajo
Why’d you replace “taken” with “wasted” when pizzaface shows up
Peppino.exe is real 😮
we need a thousand march!
2:31 the lap number looks like a date
This should be called pizza tower mods cover
Poor pizzahead
I like how pizza face went from trying to kill peppino to being genuinely concerned
the tousand march?
imagine lap 4 or sugary spire
this just shows how people can flex in pizza tower
why doesnt pizza face just destroy peppino's pizza
So I just want to say is Papino isn’t Evie Evie is it so character in it technically turns Papino into background character
A love shout out to the ALL mods
Pizza Tower - Absolute AbsurZiti (Lap 4 Fanmade OST)
Finally, Peppino got his own boss fight soundtrack.
Everyone's talking about the multiple mods referenced in here. I'm over here wondering why Pillar John is dressed up as Fred Flintstone in the background at 1:00
2:06 HOLY FVCKING SHIT HES GONE INSANE D:
The people in pizza tower seem to be the only ones concerned about mods
Best video ever that’s what pepper man voice is and the vigleanti and pizza head
"ah phooey."  - pizzaboy "totino" pizzahead
Now we need lap 4!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥   Note: we do not
I like the music
He need's help Legend says he's still going through the laps.
This is the funkiest beat I have heard in a while and peppino has truly lost his mind now!
The Pizzaoven in the video is the mod manager for the game.
Why did you put a whole bunch of random mods in this?
This channel’s mascot went from a fat penguin king to a nutty jester to a midget with blue hair and pronouns to freaking Peppino. I love it.
My man is going insane
AS AN EEVEE!!! Goes to show how much sanity is left in peppinos… EVERYTHING
I've noticed the lap number Peppino has at the end is 1262023. Turns out.. it makes a date. 12/6/2023. It's definitely a release date for a song.. but what? Edit: nvm it was 1/26/2023 the release date of pizza tower bruuuuuuuuuuuh
He uses a PIZZA OVEN to get the mods like the free download able application PIZZA OVEN
0:25 literally wreck it ralph hacking scene
2:31 Did you notice that 1/26/2023 is pizza tower's release date?
Oh phooey  - A dead pizza guy thing
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FIRE
Gender swap pseudough momen
“AS AN EEVEE” got me
The fake peppino part of the song ( not when he turns into a eevee the … other one )  Makes me wanna reevaluate my life choices  I regret so much ( I don’t mean it inspired me it made me wanna rip out my eyes and burn my body )  Good song though  But if you ever show THAT mod  I’m gonna snap worse then peppino did  Also this came out on my birthday so extra bday surprise neat
HE IS USING PIZZA OVEN TO INATALL THE MODS!!! THAT IS SO CLEVER!!!!
Let. him. cook.
You need do a cover of death mode of the scoutdigo mod dude
2:30 those last 4 numbers is the current year.
YES i can go to Haven now
now do Unexpectancy I don’t care if some company copyrighted the pizza tower ost said company doesn’t matter
Dude really finished cooking the lap 3 mod on the pizza oven💀
Didn’t you guys do a stream with some of these mods?
I hope you do pepperman and the vigilante bosses ( and the final boss and the final escape/ the crumbling tower of pizza )  I can’t wait for the boss rush
2:30 something is definitely happening on December 6th later this year, we may not know what it is but something will happen
All mods covered. Infinite laps. Fighting all bosses. Evee mod. Wario mod. Peppina mod *not finished*
Wait till peppino finds out pizzaoven can only launch one mod at a time (love the inclusion of the eevee mod btw)
wow
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS FIRE BRO
The amount of laps peppino has done us 12 6 2023( possible date for new video )
could you show the gameplay of the eevee mod
The eevee part took me by complete surprise
1:47 i agree with pizza face
Lap 4  with lyrics will probably be pizza head running from Peppion
2:29 How is nobody talking about how specific a number that is?? That feels less like a number, and more like a date. December 6th, 2023? WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING, FUNNY RECORDING DUDE??
Finally
plume mod mario mod pony mod meme.mod waifu mod
We know what you did you referenced the eevee  mod
That's cool
Pizza face was like: …oh pineapple
0:10 Pun intended?
Never in my life did I expect a timeline where you would do Pillar John’s revenge. I can die in peace now.
Like pepino when you Install a mod in the game
its a good thing Peppino did that to the game cuz it makes the game easier
2:29 1/26/2023?
WE'RE DOING 1839203 LAPS WITH THIS ONE 🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥
I can tell that this is the average lap three in ptuce lol
2:52 sonic.exe refference:
You're amazing
2:21 why just why
Fun fact: pizza tower was released on my birthday.
he has gone insane bro... BUT THIS SONG IS SO GOOD IT'S LIKE MY NEW FAVORITE SONG HOLY MOLY
WE MAKING IT OUT OF THE OVEN WITH THIS ONE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
1:50 so theese are all the boss voice so that means all boss fights with lyrics
No one: ... Me: who gave peppino a fucking reality stone?!
2:31 is cuphead next ( cuphead show fans know )
2:31 one of the best parts
Peppino hasn't gone mad he gone insane

This just proves just how pizza tower is loved by so many people!!! The mods are proof of that!!
1:00 the death I devserveiollie with lyrics refrence
2:51 my god, X corrupted him HE’S AN EXE NOW!!!!!!😱
ITS TIME FOR LEGIT FUNNKKKIIINNNGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!
pizza tower multiplayer mods: *just the same songs but the vocals echos*
It’s poggers
Eevee is my fave Pokemon so I'm so glad that pepino turned into an eevee I know it's a random choose but it still makes me happy
i lost it the sec i heard him say "As an Eevee"
"Oh phooey" famous last words from pizza head
bro said the matrix
I love 2:22 it’s just got something in me to go break dance
"oh phooey"-pizzaface, 2:31
As a Pizza Oven user this is realistic
I liked that pizza oven and the other mods reference,very good cover like the others ❤
So is nobody going to talk about the fact that Peppino changed into Peppina and faker copied him?
Cool music!
And just as i thought this would be a good streak.       Recd YOU NEED TO DO MORE OF WHERE PEPPINOS SUFFERS FOR HIS ACTIONS
I love all the mods referenced. Just, mwah! 👌Chief kiss!    (If only you could combine mods though 🥲)
(cant wait for lap four and snick.exe singing)
naw relased da date bout 12/6/2023 idk was that means
Hi
Lap 1,262,023, Peppino really has nothing better to do, huh?
Peppino is getting to powerful and cocky
Thanks for the video.
Peppino literally is just a  dude who wants the hardest mod..
Hahahahahahhahaha
Im sure he good
For me the laps are literally this: Lap 1: Escaping death. Lap 2: Challenging death. Lap 3 and more: Mocking death.  Pizza Head, is not what you have done, is what the community has done.
Cute Eevee
Wow that sonic exe reference was good 👍
Pizza face: “AHA I FINALLY CAUGHT UP TO YOU!”  Pepino: HAH, jokes on-a you IDIOT, I CAN-A PARRY YOU!” Pizza face: “WHAT!?” Pepino: “I'ma not-a gonna sugarcoat it, DID YOU KNOW YOU CAN-A PARRY ANY PROJECTILE BY PRESSING “C” BEFORE GETTING HURT!?”
You know, after the release of the Lap 5 video, we might finally see Peppino try Pizzascape.
“Is that-a so?”
the idea of peppino going absolutely MAD with modding along with john being glad peppino is making it to the end so the madness stops, only to make it WORSE is amazing lmao before I watched this though I thought of the lyrics at the end being something along the lines of ' you cannoli run so far, peppino I'll catch you very soon. ' referencing a different song for an extra lap that I found a while back I'd say honestly that yours was WAYY better though
Lap 1: Peppino is afraid of Pizzaface. Lap 2: Peppino is determined to outrun Pizzaface. Lap 3: *Pizzaface is afraid of Peppino*
I LOVE DIS SONG
I like your Pizzahead impressions, but your Vigilante  could use a bit more work
When you abuse the power of mods
YO I GAVE THIS IDEA IN ONE STREAM IM SO GLAD THEY DID IT
I love how it also references the Pizza Oven, the mod manager for the game
Maybe try doing final lap with lyrics. Where maybe e the bosses come up with a plan to stop peppino so they Installed the final lap mod Make pizza face giant And the level behind him disappears when pizza face Is chasing him  Edit: Heres the link btw https://youtu.be/ONxD0pA6E20
That lil exe. quote slip at the end was great
next can it be lap pi?
The music is FIRE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥️🔥️🔥🔥🔥️🔥️🔥🔥🔥️🔥️🔥🔥🔥️🔥️🔥🔥🔥️🔥️🔥🔥🔥️🔥️🔥🔥🔥️🔥️🔥🔥🔥🔥️🔥!!!!!!!!!!!
Legends says that lap 4 with lyrics will release!
NAH NAH HE DID NOT JUST TURN INTO ONE OF MY FAVORITE PIZZA TOWER MODS AINT NO WAY AIN NO WAY
New favorite song unlocked
Well this came outta nowhere....yet its welcome
I love how fake peppino just looks at peppino like 🤩
*”AS-A-EEVEE!”*
Peppino has gone all out
12/6/2023
12/6/2023 2:31
Nice reference to “baking the fourth wall”!
No way peppino did stay for the lap 3
I love that ending! “I’m not trapped in here with you, you’re trapped in here with me!”
I love how pizza head is genuinely scared of peppino at this point, like, he has no idea whats going on anymore. This was supposed to be *his* game for peppino, but hes modded it so much that pizza face cant even keep up anymore. I also like how Pizza Heads voice sounds like its coming from an old CRT TV with a crappy speaker  The reference to sonic.exe at the end was also not lost on me.  Edit, i just now realized that the Peppina Ramen mod peppino turned on at 2:19 also affected Fake Peppino too. Weird.  1 million, 262 thousand and 23 laps, that implies that he's been at this for *hours*
evvee peppino
After this, PEPPINO accidentally unleashed snick. This leads into snick chasing him down. And him barely making it out. Now with a heightened realization that he should just leave things alone.
✨aw phooey✨
At this rate Peppino's going to wake up outside the exit door with the equivalent of a hangover after that much of a power trip-
Beans
Peppino Has Gone Insane.
FINALLY
You could do a video about robo-patrick theme from spongebob battle for bikini bottom
1:54 "Who aren't-a you people?" -Fake Peppino
THEY REFERENCED THE PINKIE MOD  also i like how his lap count at the end shows that the vid may be a bit late lol
This is my favourite song❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉 picture of a mega this is why I like your channel
good now do lap 4
he really DID go insane
I like how Peppino is actually determined to make it to the goal without Pizzaface and any other obstacle to get in his way. The fact these songs are actually giving a story about Peppino’s bravery hopes that this will help match Peppino’s official character development.
The moral of the story is that perfection isnt the thing you always want. Because it may drive you insane.
Uh... Guys? Look at 2:30. Its not just a random number, IT'S A DATE! 12/6/2023  Edit: yeah I've um learned that it's actually the date the game was released
I like how you added the mods of everything
John is dead
I love how he used a literal Pizza Oven just like how you mod Pizza Tower with Pizza Oven
I love how pizza oven is representated as a literal pizza oven
next= lap 4 cover
I absolutely love how you can tell that all the pressure broke him and now he’s created a hell for himself and everyone else
The pay to win kid be like:
I love how the fabric of reality is a stack of pizza and he just has these universal powders (drugs? maybe)
"As an EEVEE!!!"  Of all of the bits, this tipped me over the edge. Peppino turning into a Pokemon is what finally made me snap.
my god peppino 2:30 HOW MANY HOURS HAVE YOU BEEN THERE
Peppino and pizza face switched places
NO WAY PEPPINO BECAME EEVEE AND PINKIE PIE
I’m finna go to bed and RecD casually drops an absolute BANGER
Интересный факт: Первый кавер на песню John Pillar's Revenge был сделан Злым Монахом
How fast is that chef like 1M speed
Peppino as an Eevee caught me off guard lol, but seriously, this is insanely good.
I’m surprised there weren’t any other voice actors for Peppino’s other forms..
MAKE SUGARY SPIRE SONGS RECD
What im a big fan and i love every song and there cool andi like youre voices of the song
Papa con queso
Oh phooey🤣
even tho its only 3 mins it was worth the wait
seeing peppino as a... uh... lot of things COMPLETELY caught me off guard    hey what are you doing with that water stone-
i love the symbolism with the "pizza oven" being used to symbolize the one-click install tool for pizza tower of the same name
I want the war o the lap 4, can you do it please?
1:41 its literally game 2 days after two guys put them mods
hell na, this is absurd
Lap 4...
peppino turned himself into eevee. but hes still have his insanity
What the cannoli, why is this actually fire
Idk why but this gives me undertale vibes The genocide route specifically There trying to be villains but pepinno's actions/insanity are concerning and kinda scaring them effecting there roles little Pizza face/head: threatening to confused to concerned Fake peppino: well he hasn't changed much In undertale Papyrus go's from a over confident skeleton to a wholesome skeleton that no matter what he believes in you Undyne from trying to get to the soul to free there kind to trying to get revenge for her dead friend And of course sans was very much effected What if this has a story🤔
Alternate title: Peppino does mods with lyrics
Lap 4?
Italy
"PizzaOven"
The way peppino used mods to fight all the bosses using the "PizzaOven" is funny
Im ready for a new one for lap 4, but he fails, with Pillar Jhon, Pizzaface and Snick.exe laughing over his death
Time to put the seventh pizza tower fan song on my belt.... I think I have a problem.
WE NEED LAP 4!!!!!!!
*aeugh*
Peppeevee 😂
YES
2:51 Finn Crust: Folks, I think I Might have PROOF Im getting my own game!
fire
I have listen to this song so many times and it has been out for a few hours. Now this is some really good singing and the beat is just so damn good the pizzas how to communicate really make some Bangor behind songs
I love noise and Fake Peppinos reaction
I LOVE THE SONG RECD
n o w d o l a p 4
2:17 I love the fact that Peppino beat the heck out of Theodore as the AEUGH Pufferfish XD
John probaly would listen to this instead of going hunt Peppino
How’s lap 4 going to sound? It’s so fast!
Bro, now I feel bad for pizza head
Speed running back to school shopping
I love the character development from horrified of pizza time to confidently completing lap 2 to going through insanity just for a little more challenge.
THIS IS THE BEST SONG RECD
1:58 This would make a great, animated meme
PEPPINO ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND!?
it's real.
*This is why Pizza Oven can’t run multiple mods. YET…*
Bro was so obsessed that he rewrote reality multiple times, becoming a furry, a female, etc
Now I can't decide who's more powerful! Peppino or Pizzahead?
He's reached the point of insanity he had unlocked the power of modding💀💀💀
[ANOMALY DETECTED] [ID: PEPPINO 184B] [THREAT LEVEL: RANK 60] [BEGIN ANOMALY CONTAINMENT  PROTOCOL]
Gee No Wonder Why Games Dont SLeep
someone make a lap 4
That aint peppino thst insane peppino
WAIT I REALIZED THE REASON WHY ITS USING A PIZZA OVEN TO MAKE MODS. ITS BECAUSE HES USING PIZZA OVEN TOO MAKE THESE MODS
and thus, Peppino.EXE was born
0:22  THIS POSE????
Oh hey peppina😂
i love the sonic.exe reference at the end
Now make lap 4 💀
I think we're all forgetting the fact that laps 2 and beyond are technically not canon.
Peppino has now discovered the power of moding
Pepino discovered mods
Oh Pizza Head, it's Pizza Time!  Yes Peppino...
god of mod
NAHHH MODS
THE PERFECT MUSIC!!! WITH LYRICS!!!!
I love insane he is and that mods he was hilarious😂 (especially the pufferfish 🐡)
Pinkie Peppino Pie made an appearance!
Now all that's left is for Peppino to meet Pizzelle and it's over
Нихуя не понятно, но очень интересно 👍
AS AN EEVEE!  Peppino has lost it
Im gonna P Rank all floor 1 with this music 😀 (suffer)
I just got ONE thing to say. If peppino was already that insane just with lap 3. Imagine how would he react with Lap 4 PLUS Snick.exe
Wait a minute… look at what lap Peppino eevee was on before the outro came  As you can see, it said “Lap 1262023”, so what I came up with is that it’s a day of the year..  1/26/2023 January 26, 2023  Is that when pizza tower came out?
I love eevee
Peppino turned into a pokémon that's going to destroy pizza face!
Ngl I use the waifu toppin mods while playing the crumbling tower level and cyop for just fun time  I even try the debugging mod just to test for fun like the pepper and the shotgun
I want to be this crazed man one day
CAN YOU PLEASE DO LAP 4 (Absolute Absurziti)!? 😁😁😁😁
2:30  Evepino: is that-a so? *holds a sign of 1262023 laps*
Lap 4 mod enjoyers:
1:59 Blame Patafoin :v That french ex-spriter animator made this mod. He really loves Eeves. 2:20 Special Guest: Peppina Ramen 2:30 IT'S OVER NINE DOUSAAAAAAND!!!! >:v
RecD, random question, have you heard of this game called Billie Bust Up?
peppino got dat massive forehead 💀
The laps got me 💀
The pizza oven as the source of the mods is really clever, since the pizza tower mod loader is called pizza oven
i love how this shows how peppino modded the game and pizzaface is aware that hes in a game
pjr
Piss time next plz
I like how Peppino's lap counter at the end references the game's release date
I like how peppino just changed everything in the entire game and pizza face just thought it was a dream
i love how this references the mods we added in our mod (pizza tower united community edition) they are the most popular after all
We need a Last Strain of Grain Cover!!!!! I thinked in a introduction:  * Lap ∞ *  Peppino: welp.. this-a will be the last strain of grain. Peppino: This is-a your Last Chance to escape, until your pc dies.  Peppino: Choose one.  * Noise selected *  Peppino: well, im now the evil here... YOU WILL NEED-A ESCAPE WITH EVERYONE HERE!  XenoPizza/Peppino: heheheh XenoPizza/Peppino: * loud evil creepy laugh *  * infinity of mods appears mixed with XenoPizza/Peppino *
You forgot something at the end of lap 3 there a song of run out time
GOD THIS MAN IS INSANE (he like me frfr) but i cant wait for lap 4, i mostly cant wait for snicks voice. i bets its gonna take 8 months
ah phooey this was funny
YAYYYYYYY
Bro was so crazy that he went to lap 1262023 LIKE DUDE CHILL
hey peppino! try this mod! *shows toppin gals mod*
Hey, did anyone else notice that the final lap sign is a date? it's said "1262023" thats in dates is: 12-06-2023 (I'll just say this, bye lol)
Peppino go crazy
I knew this was gonna happen sooner or later.
itd be REALLYYYYY cool if you covered glucose getaway (from sugary spire)
now...  if we get lap 4, i have an idea.  include mods or ENTIRELY different fangames to the video,  mods that changes the MAIN GAMEPLAY, w rank being a no hit rank, pizzarank mod or that one mod that haves pizzaface chases you throughout ALL levels, or even OP peppino, specifically that one where you accelerate to a MAD speed.  fangames are obvious, loco tower, sugary spire, scoutdigo, frenzy worlds, demo 3.  my ideas for a possible lap 4 lyeics video!
YESSSS
He was cooking with a pizza oven could that be talkin about the mod manager pizza oven
This is so sad I can't believe they called him Peppino
Nice rhymicd
where is my peppibot factory with lyrics
I love the story telling from missing a topping to perfecting the level to finally finding the perfect challenge   Also eevee mod fuck yay
Unexpectancy
If I had a nickel for every time a community went full masochist mode and messed with absurd mods just for fun, I'd have 2 nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice. Context: Hollow Knight's "Any Radiance (3.0 at the moment)". Seriously Hollow Knight players are wacky
Ah. god complex in song form
Make pepperman with lyrics
Now I really want to hear Pepperman Strikes and Unexpectancy with lyrics after getting a brief sample of your voices for the boss characters. Maybe even a Gustavo song for Gnome Forest?
Lap 4.
Ngl it would make for a perfect part 1 if you ever decide to do lap -1 song that someone created as it makes peppino learn his lesson and that he shouldn't mod the game just to give him a tougher challenge and if you want to you could sneak in lap -2 or possibly lap pi
Yeesssss
You should make a lap 4 and 5 and 6 and 7 and 8 and 9 and the last 10
cool
WE GETTING THE L+ RANK WITH THIS ONE
OOOO
"youve lost your mind" "But i found something so much better" peak deranged quote
Omg lap 3 I saw a fan made one but this is awsome
Bro i was falling a sleep then i heard this 1:58
O my god this is going to be what I listen to for the next two weeks, now do lap pi!
Wow
Peppino’s villain arc
2:02 - 2:24 Honestly, my favorite part in this whole video.
Is that-a so?
peppino be poppin off
I never thought a pizza chef with anxiety could scare me, but here we are.
Everyone thinked peppino would be afraid of doing lap 3... But this... This changes everything...
hey I made a playlist of some songs I personally like so I hope you agree ' v ' here is the link https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6cxvrDm14rP628AWgK5ZvSVqQbuc_H0F
I like the idea of Peppino just cooking  modded pizzas, it's a nice nod to Pizza Oven being a modding software.  You know it's bad when even Pizzaface and the other bosses think Peppino's gone mad. This must be what everyone in the tower sees when you mod PT to play as a different character (Like Pinkie Pie or Eevee) or "Lap" Pizzaface and Snick (if he's even chasing Peppino in the mod).
I don’t think anyone noticed at 2:30. It’s a date.
2:31 got me dead 💀
maaaan i love warioplier's lap 3 mod. it's just so brutal, but still somehow feels fair most of the time. and this song really makes you FEEL that brutality, vozaxhi really made the song fit in the game. playing with pizza time feels like a mad scramble to the end. playing with death I deservioli feels like being cheered on a victory lap. playing with pillar john's revenge makes you feel like you stumbled on a forbidden challenge and the challenge is daring you to test your metal anyways
Pls lap 4 Plsssssss
Wtf ._.
So fire
Yo pedí la vuelta 3 y me dieron like
THE PIZZA OVEN IS A REFERENCE TO PIZZA OVEN THE ULTIMATE PIZZA TOWER MOD MANAGER!!!!????
Well, he DID say he would stay for lap 3...
Why didn't you make pizza boy (or whatever his name is I forgot sorry) say "oh philly" instead of "oh phooey". A funny cheese joke would be very funny
I was not expecting the Eevee mod to appear XD
i love how its a pizza oven to make mods for a good knock back at the mod installer pizza oven.
recD knows about the eevee mod, this is perfect
Peppino really lost it after fighting Fake Peppino
Oh mercy
Peppinos gone completley crazy
I love when snick appears in the pizzaface dialog
the laps that peppino made it says 1262023 so it could be   6/12/2023 i think im getting a bit insane...
This music is good 👍
Oh my god
My jaw dropped as soon as I hear "As an eevee" 11/10
U should do fnf sonic exe next
Just when I thought you hit your peak with these pizza tower songs, you manage to break the roof and go even harder then before, funny enough it matches the spirit of lap 3. Fantastic work as always.
i like how every mod is a real mod even evee
Send this idea to the creators of pizza tower: Make them make lap4 and 5
PEPPINO YOUR NOT SUPPOSED TO BAKE THE FOURTH WALL AND YOUR NOT PINKY PIE
i just got it. "Pizza Oven"
Legends say Tricky will be next FNF mod with lyrics next year.
This one had me in tears with laughter precisely because of how I've run most of these mods and how well made they are. "I'm not trapped in here with you, you're trapped in here with me~" was icing on the cake.
Peppino’s gone mad
bro what i just watched
Can't great for unExpectancy  But for now Great video!!
0:58 (AHH HAH HAH HAH!)  PEPPINO! You're mine! You've wasted far too much time! On a simple jog to the exit door- Wait, hang on, haven't we done this before?  I don't understand what's happening now- I'm feeling even stronger, but how!?-  It's like the whole world is rewritten to be- Oh, you gotta be kidding me...  DID YOU MOD THE ENTIRE GAME JUST TO UP YOUR CHANCE TO WIND UP MAIMED? I DON'T GET YOU MAN! WHAT'S GOING ON!? WHAT ABOUT GUSTAVO, BRICK, STICK AND JOHN?  Do you even have a single tie left To anything else but cheating death? That itty bitty ounce of concern aside- If it's death you want, *I'M GLAD TO PROVIDE.*
I like how it uses actual Pizza Tower mods, like the Eevee mod at 1:57
1:46 YOU HAD GONE WAY TO FAR, PEPPINO! (also pepperman and vigilante voice reveal)
I didn't ask for another pizza, BUT THAT PIZZA WAS ALSO VERY DELICIOUS!
damn
BEST COVER YET
Bro, what is the 1262023 thing at the end
( 843 comment and here when this was uploaded 59 minutes ago) ITS OUT WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO and Peppino is  MODDING also did anyone see the debt paper in pizza heads room
PEPPINO IS TRULY GOD HOLY WHT SONIC.EXE REFERENCE GOD DAMN also i want to see a lap four but its more like it's he's purgatory instead of him being in control and snick.exe Chase's him
At this point Peppina might as well be canon
You should do lap four with lyrics
OH MY GOD HES LOST IT, WE'VE GONE TOO FAR THE ITALIAN IS ON THE LOOSE
Bro got the xdelta oven💀
He has gone insane, he even turned into eevee, he has went fully off the deep edge.
The fact peppino knows about mods means he knows he is just a game
finally a lap-a- 3!
Pizza face confused 1:03  Pizza head destroyed 2:54  Pepino lost his mind 1:44
Release date here? 2:31
“Ah phooey” (the final words of pizzahead)
1:00 | i like how pizzaface already knows he did this already lol
holy badoinkers
So if you make lap 4 we need to see snick exe sing
“Thanks goodness that was a drea-“ “IS THAT A-SO??”
the lap count at the end looks like a date this year, 12/6/2023
YES
Everybody gangsta until Peppino decides to transform the entire world into Sugary Spire
0:21 - 2:24
This was amazing Also, just realized on my second time watching this "The pizza oven must-a bake-a more" Pizza oven. (Application used for pizza tower mod) Very clever and went over my head the first time
This is a musical artwork
wait until he does lap 4
Hold on! In the Lap 2 with lyrics video, Peppino got forked by Forkknight! That turned the *P* into an S.
Lap 1:get the heck outta here! Lap 2:crap go back. Lap 3:i said GO BACK!!! Lap 1262023:you Italian madman… you’ve killed us all!!!!!!
"boowomp"
Looks like Peppino has became more powerful than you could ever imagine and I didn't expect this ♾️/10 I love it.
why is lap 1M+ here            1:00  banger
2:52 Oh no peppino.exe
In 1.25x is even ✨cooler✨
please do sugary spire bro
Okay that's not very good
I Neeed this on Music streaming services
Will he do lap 4
1) YES MORE PIZZA TOWER 2) WOOO PILLAR JOHN'S REVENGE 3) *in RECD's Peppino voice * eevee?...really? 4) HOLY CRAP ITS PEPPINA RAMEN?!  (sans undertale joke)
Bro i like the eevee mod is here
The “Peppino! You’re Mine!” call back is just 🤌.
I love how i didnt get a notification youtube thanks/j
THIS IS HELL IN HELL😅
Man that was a crazy fever dream I had...! I have an idea!
Legend says that Peppino is still doing laps as we speak.
12/6/2023
and do lap 4 with lyrics
Out of all the pizza tower with lyrics videos this is the most amazing of them all
I like how peppino basically just did a year of laps
EEVEE MOD!!!!!
Do the lap 4 song
Love that Pizzaface is very concerned about what Peppino is doing
Dude that was genius! I forgot what it’s called exactly, but yeah that pizza oven is the app that mains modding pizza tower! So pepino having access to it was hilarious 😂
Whats gonna happen on 12/6/2023????????
That’s song is too good , but I think it’s not better than lap 2,hope have other song(like war)
the best lap 3 lyrics i have heard.
I swear to God I love all of your pizza Tower lyric videos and stuff ps can wait for more Friday night funkin mods lyrics videos musical lyrical
This level of insanity is how Peppino really became the Pizzano.
I love the wario mod used on pepper man because pepper man has his dash move front he wario land series
Jeez, I get teleported into a level and get beat up by a pink horse?
HELL YEA THIS RULES 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
the pizza oven
THE SEQUEL TO THE DEATH I DESERVIOLI WITH LYRICS
Peppino.exe
its funny how peppino abused pizzaoven to the extreme that he made every boss die and at the end when we FINALLY get pizzaheads voice he thought it was a dream but the infinite laps just lasted the entire night
Dang
Love that they made Pizzahead's voice sound like its recorded on a 30s microphone.
Pizza head is screwed  He made peppino insane
Suggestion for Peppino, try Lap 4 P ranks, you’ll enjoy it!
WE NEED LAP 4 NOW CAN'T WAIT 👍
bro became eevee.
IVE BEEN WAITING FOREVER FOR THIS
When he said as a eevee I was like the og reskin! For the full version not the Sage demo sorry pissino
Peppino goes insane arc
teach me how to install mods while in lap 3 and make pizzaface not chase me                          obviously I'm kidding
Can you do bye bye there with lyrics
E
Honestly just the quick”ah phooey” at the end was great😂
Damn we need lap 4
So thats why vigilante willingly kicked his butt in make some noise
if peppino does one too many mods then wish him luck in uncanny valley
I can’t wait for the lyrics of unexpectancy and bye bye
So basically peppino created the pizza equivalent of the wonder tart just so he can modify the game to do lap 3? Mad respect+      Great video btw, glad you did Pillar john's revenge!
Pre-1k gang
Pizza face: PIZZAHEAD THIS GUY ISN’T *sound affect*-ING AROUND ANYMORE HE’S GAMING   Pizzahead: ya know that’s crazy how that’s not my problem
Gosh darn, he’s a maniac.
What is that ball is it a pufferfish
If he hasn't went mad already, *then he certainly has now.*
2:30 bru 😡
average pizza tower player when they find out about mods  🗿
im sorry but this is kinda doody
LET'S F *taunt* ING GOOOO LAP 3 LYRICS!!!!!
There was scared peppino, brave peppino, mad peppino. And now you made insane peppino! The strongest peppino in the universe! He has the power of the mods!
There’s a secret in his laps
1:19 You Can Kinda See At The Bottom The Showtime Pizza Face
WHO LET HIM COOK🗣
Now when's absolutely absurzitti
peppino: just wants to do laps   pizza face: no   the class: *is suffering*
I like how you used other mods and stuff and peppino is crazy!
WHAT IS THIS GUHHH
Bro really turned off checksum validation
Peppino definitely used mods.
2 things to say: 1st: proof that the infinite/3rd lap mods are so popular that even YOU decided to do it but 2nd thing: the song and video is so frenetic that i had to put the speed to .75 to even be barely able to read all things correctly but that said KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK WE LOVE IT!!!
I love how this is the perfect representation of the pizza tower fan base…making their lives harder for the rush..no matter what..it can and will never be enough..it will always get harder
lap 4 when (jk, do it if you want though)
1262023 the release date lol
funny since you cant stack mods
2:30 Strange...looks like the lap number is a date of some kind. 12/6/2023, to be exact.  I think that's supposed to reference August 12th, 2023 (the day this video came out) which, at the time of this comment being posted, is today.  But seems like one of the digits is off...I wonder why that is?
OH GOD
Peppino in Pizza Time: Oh no! Oh god! I'm gonna f*cking die if i don't find that last toppin!  Peppino in The Death I Deservioli: The P Rank shall be mine! Catch me if you can death!  Peppino in Pillar John's Revenge: It's official, I've gone mad with power in my desire to crave a challenge until it finally kills me!  _Gotta love that character development as he descends into madness_
i love how the mods are shown via a oven in reference to the mod manager PizzaOven
Where is lap 4
i can't believe peppino.xdelta is real
AS AN EEVEE!
Is pizza oven a conicedence or a reference to the pizza tower mod manager pizza oven
I just realized the oven is literally just the pizza oven mod tool
I was not expecting anything of this and I like it.
Cant wait for lap 4
So when’s lap 4-5, pepper man
Pizza tower mods like
.... Uh peppino has definitely went insane already it's not even a final boss time yet.... Guess it's peppino' pizza tower
This is what happens when you drive a man mad and turn him from a simple man to a cartoony maniac for a laugh! Great video!
my head canon now any game modded is the main character becomes a crazy man.
ITS HEREEE
Peppino just sums up 76% of the Pizza Tower modding community: a bunch of masochists aching for even more challenges for an already hard game
well thats a exe reference
12/6/2023 something big will happen what will happen idk but something will happen
me in lap 10
Eviee? Wario? Pinkie? Pepina ramen?  PUFFERFISH? Bro, what the fu-?
I DIDN'T KNOW THIS JUST GOT UPLOADED
I like how peppino is modding the game through a pizza oven. That was a nice reference lol.
SiiiU
John gutter but Pizza Face has insomnia
NOO! peppino cringe
can’t wait for lap 4
MODDED MADNESS I LOVE IT
It's just my mind or in the laps it says "1262023",the day 12/6/2023?
bro he aint mario what
And that’s why there isn’t Unexpectancy With Lyrics!
2:02 1. Patafoin made the eevee mod 2. Wario mod 3. Pinki pie mod 4. WTH is this 5. Peppina mod is great 6. Peppino has lost his whole mind now
i was wondering when this would release  good job bro
The fourth wall?
Never thought something could be worse than the entirety of the fnf musical but here we are now I guess
Peppino literally learned the Ultimate Power Force, that not even the Game Creator could fight out... F#CKING MODS !!!
Peppino has gone to far
Bro turned the Vigilante into a grilled cheese💀💀💀
peppino's last line he should of wore his war helmet and had a rocket launcher
I've watched this like 6 times
Now it's the turn of lap 4
im kinda curious if he is gonna do lap 4
Lab three is when Peppino lost his entire mind and everything else and I love it
645TH COMMENT  LESS GO
This song is really about how the mod community is kinda crazy and I love it
mama mia
HOWD I GET HERE UNDER 40 MIN OF THIS BEING MADE, HOW
As much as I like the lore, I would kill for someone to make this be only the song and cleanly loop-able.
Ah phooy-
what if the ranking for this is I for impossible
Now for lap 4
2:31 are we just gonna ignore the fact that this man went for over 1 MILLION LAPS. And that’s on top of the other stuff he decided to throw in
I like the pizza face part
PILLAR JOHN THROWING DOWN ON THE LAWN!
peppino: discovers how to bake the fourth wall also peppino: LITERALLY DISCOVERING HOW TO MAKE MADNESS, INF LAPS, ALL BOSSES, AND CHANGING CHARACTERS

I died laughing when peppino Turnt into eevee
Idea for a new song with lyrics I would try to do sugar Rush from sugary spire
I just can’t believe you included Peppina. Just, wow 😮
HE LOST HIS MIND  HE HAS GONE INSANE, THE MODS ARE MAKING HIM MORE POWERFUL, TORTURING EVERYONE IN ITS PATH  THE END IS NEAR, overall holy shit the mods i've played in this video holy shit (except with all bosses mod idk of that exists)
The Evee mod was a nice touch; showcasing that not only is Peppino officially, certifiably, undeniably cuckoo at this point (everyone's scared; _EVERYONE_ ... EVEN *_FAKE PEPPINO_* FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!!!), but he's also a Pokemaniac! That or all the mods did something to him. Your guess is as good as mine; but it's all going nuttier than squirrel droppings and Peppino's the only one who doesn't seem to realize it!!!
Pizzahead doesn't own the Pizza Tower now, Peppino owns it for his own selfish challenges.
THANK YOU NOW I LIVE IN PIECE
This song was good but not peppinos pie good. But the other pizza tower songs you made (all of them), you baked them with care. Delicacy. And just right. Like better then peppinos pie by at least 3% (just because that pie looked universally domestically abusing not in musical conduction because if we're talking about music then 10% but  likely higher) but the other music's likely higher like 54-58% likely higher. But still good job either way.
Peppino finally snapped.
This is amazing man.
As an Eevee?????? [insert soyjak pointing here] Edit for a Fun Fact: The lap number at the end is the Steam release date in American format.
I like how Peppino mods the whole game just taunt Pizzaface.
Nice with litteraly all mods
January 26, 2023 is a Lap Name at the END
this is amazing, i love how you put popular mods in this, it's awesome, probably one of the best pizza tower lyric video's you've done
Pizza face said my favorite line from lap 2 so this is just awesome
Lap 4 When?
PEPPINO🗣️🗣️🗣️💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔛🔝
“Thank goodness all that poppycock was a nightmare”  “*is that so?*”  “Aw phooey.”
PEPPINO ARE YOU INSANE? “Yes”
This song.  makes me go full on italian.
Can you make a song dead ahead zombie warfare it’s my favourite game I always like to see a of song it 🤩🤩🤩🤩😇😇😇😇🥺🥺🥺🥺
This SLAPS
Let's go lap 3 cover! Wooo
this is much better than every other thing you ever done
I’m only Create Your Own Pizza had a theme, because that would be the natural evolution of this absolute MADNESS.
Why wasnt piss towel here?
bro peppino has went so fast till the point the hundreds are now miliseconds 💀
More like lap 3 trillion.
Is almost  my birthday
Now just waitin for the lap 4 😊   Also its sick
"Is it time to crush peppino already?" LOL  Edit: "The Pizza Oven must bake MORE!!!" Does RecD now know about Pizza Oven (Pizza Tower mod manager)
Can we have lap 4 plss
Alternate title *i becomes a modder*
Dude, the pizza oven reference is so clever
Sophist reference
The inclusion of the many other mods like the eevee and pufferfish skins, the boss rush, the infinite laps, that was all so smart to add and do well done as always! And the callback to Pizza Face’s lap 2 lyrics…Amazing job as always RecD and team!!
Pizzelle: "Man, what a day. Never thought I'd enter this tower." Pizzelle: "...and find that I'm not alone. Great..."
next time the bosses will have ptsd from the mods
i am big big fan i like how you voised these guys its very fun and good to watch
When you just:
is that ending cutscene a Sonic.EXE Reference? Peppino: "So many mods, so little time, wouldn't you agree?" Sonic.EXE: "So many souls, so little time, wouldn't you agree?"
Would really like to see Thousand Par with lyrics!
Bro really pulled the most out of pocket "No u" card in existance 💀💀💀
wow I did not expect a reference to the most popular pizza tower mods that was surprising
yes it heve
YES LETS GO LOL
Lap 1, he's stressed out of his mind and is desperate to leave, but not desperate enough to turn down the last chance for 100%. Lap 2, he's got a structured mind, and has planned everything so he'll get a P-rank, and has conquered his stress and turned it into pride. Lap 3, he's out of his mind, and has become such a prideful thrill seeker he's more than willing to put himself through unbelievable stress because he's grown to love it, and is willing to alter the fabric of reality in order to chase that high, all while ready to transcend species and gender.  That's character development alright.
DO LAP 4 NEXT
bet that lap 4 lyrics are next. i do like the ending lol
*You can’t fool me with Lap 1262023 Thats a date for a video of 12.6.2023*
Peppino! Have you lost your sanity?!
That "Oh phooey." got me cracking up.
PEPPINO HAS UNLOCK THE  ENDLESS GOD ACHEVMENT
"ON A SIMPLE JOG TO THE EXIT DOOR, wait hang on, havent we dont this before?"smart
I cant waitfotlap 4
Honestly, this is me with pizza tower lol Great minds think alike, amirite Peppino?   And yes, i do agree.
Can't wait for Pepperman Strikes WITH LYRICS!
BRO TURNED INTO SONIC.EXE AT THE END 2:51
Cool reference to the eevee mod
My theory is that you will upload something on 1/26/2023 but what will it be?
2:51 SONIC.EXE REFERENCE!?
Lap 1262023💀
Espere meses para la lap 3 ahora falta lap 4
I love how they reference mods like the Eevee Reskin, Pizza Party, Pufferfish and Peppina.
Once peppino has found a book, now he’s a god
AYO THIS IS THE BEST LYRIC THAT I EVER HEARD IN MY WHOLE LIFE
LAP 3 fire !
I love how at 1:03 Pizzaface realizes something is wrong  Edit : Not sure but this is intentional but at 1:43 when Peppino says "The Pizza Oven Must-a Bake-a More" its most likely a reference to "Pizza Oven" which is a program that lets you install mods without having to patch them
His love is with this fan-made song it's like at the beginning of it there's anything I think it's kind of funny like the mods are like actual pizzas where peppino's trying to cook turn reminds me of the mod manager named pizza oven
Peppino.exe?
Omg
Pizza Head: (Drives Peppino mad with his tower one too many times.)  Peppino: Oh Pizza Head… *Y O U   H A V E N ‘ T   S E E N   M Y   T R U E   S T R E N G T H   Y E T ! ! !*  Pizza Head: I DON’T WANT AT ALL! AT ALL! AT ALL! AT ALL!    Also, I LOVE how the Pizza Oven was the gateway to all this madness as Pizza Oven is the name of the app all these mods could be used from.
Imagine a mod where like after lap 10, the area suddenly changes to a different level. He would have no idea where to go then. XD
Imagine theres lyrics for lap 4
Quien diria que un juego de un italiano gordo que va a velocidades supersonicas llegaria tan lejos
pizza-oven joke right?
no fricking way
"oh phooey"
Peppino is insane :O  Good references to the most popular mods of the game :D
I love how even Pizza face is worried of Peppino's Insanity
Cool! It would be cool if you could also do lap 4
BEST VIDEO EVER MAKE A LOT OF CONTENT I LIKE THIS VIDEO A LOT MAKE A LOT MORE I WILL ALWAYS WATCH YOU I SUBCRIBED
Bro just made the best Pizza Tower modding anthem in the world!
That...was...AMAZING!!  The amount of mods you can reference, the music, the LYRICS, all perfection just to make an already great song EVEN BETTER! Thank you for making this amazing music!  Also, wait until he gets the CYOP mod!  😈
26 minutes ago?
The song was so good! Until it hit about half way through. Sure, the mod references are fun, I just kind of wish it was limited to ONLY lap 3.
let's face it; five floors of madness far too many close scrapes with death by pie topping at every turn Not to mention the literal sewer level somehow located near the _top_ of the blasted tower instead of, say, below it like any sensible architect would have _surely_ done. All because a quasi-mechanized extra extra large pizza threatened Spaghetti's restaurant with laser-y dooooom...unless the whole thing's a metaphor for a super pizza chain opening near the restaurant leading to doom by competition instead.  And then the 'pilot' of that quasi-mechanized pizza gets blown out and more or less revealed to have done all this to _mess_ with Peppino, if the second phase of the final boss is anything to go by. In that Pizzahead looks and acts more like a spoiled child trying to show his new 'friend' all his 'cool toys.' By hitting/shooting Peppino with them.  Yeah Pizzahead had this round of trolling from Peppino coming.
I think I get the pizza oven thing! Pizza oven is a mod magager for pizza tower and the pizzas are mods! I don’t get the more than 1 mod though.
So he's a god with pizza tower mods
errm recd thats cool and all but you should do thousand par lyrics NGL;.....................
Wait till Peppino finds out ptu or ptt exists
Pizza face: you've lost your mind    peppino: I found something better   me: oh trust me we're about to cause chaos its about sending a message
Why does Peppino want many laps?
What if this man does Lap 4?
Eevee Peppino was something I didn't know I needed. The Eevee mod is awesome
Did I see peppina?
Peppino did over 10,000 laps in the spand of seconds
mod‽ 1:10
Cool Song Bro!
no brother no no no no no this IS EPIC HOW THE HELL DO YOU DO THESE LYRICS😶😶😶
the perfect pizza
snick
Bro spent 18372 hours on this game cuz of 1262023 laps
the references to the pinkie pie mod I did showing up in this was not expected but a VERY good surprise,,,
Dude, you make good songs, I admit it!  And apparently with the help of a special program, although it does not matter.  So far, I can’t even afford this, because firstly I need a normal computer, and secondly, desire and time.  However, I continue to write some scripts for songs from time to time, so that later I can use them for my own purposes.  But with Monika's song, there are some little problems, and no, I'm not talking about Juno and Epiphany's version, but about my own version!  Version 1.0 of the script can be considered a bit of a failure, because  from a song it turned into a novel in verse on 11k+ symbols!  The second version does not yet exist, because rhymes will need to be invented!  How I love my job as a screenwriter!
Spongebob Reference 1:55
Legit I want a version of this without the intro and outro
I love how you referenced the actual pizza tower mod manager called "pizza oven"
oh no...  *he's getting stronger...*
Pizzahead’s voice sounds like an old television and it’s PERFECTION
will you ever do a sugary spire song?
0:14 peppino, I think you mean you baked THE LAP 3 MOD
i like how the pizza oven is basically a reference to the pizza tower mod loader (which is literally called pizza oven)
Unexpectancy with lyrics is definitely a possibility now that all of the required characters have official voices
peppino goes insane 2
Wow i love the song end lep 3 end mode! I love it!
Oh boy oh boy it's here
I heard if you say RecD 3 times you get pinned  RecD RecD RecD
Lap 4 time. Absolute Abzurtiti is the next lap. Also i love the reference to the 1 click mod installer, being Pizza Oven. No forget all that, this is amazing! Oh yeah, edit: wait until he discovers Egg Lap Mod and Lap Hell: Hotfix N Ready, IT'S ALL FUCKIN OVER
The Pizza Oven Reference
This song was chaos
I love how Peppino uses a magical pizza oven to do Lap 3, summon the bosses, become Eevee, AND infinite laps. Clearly a reference to the Pizza Oven mod manager.
2:18  Puffino aughetti!  He's reached his strongest form!
"Who needs sanity when this proves none of you can predict my moves?" Damn.
Cap you do final boss with lyrics
Bro, bravo. You’ve managed to encapsulate the modding scene in this community in a way that’s poetic, serious, and funny all at once all while dropping piping hot bars.
Now that we've final heard Pizza Heads voice, are you gonna do all 3 phases of Unexpectancy and The crumbling of Pizza Tower?
I love this as a modder myself I tried lap 3 and I failed  Edit: the pizza oven is a reference to the modding tool for pizza tower called pizza oven  Edit 2 the level was the crumbling tower of pizza
Peppino really went insane
Piza
"oh boy, time to go to slee-" *proceed to jam to this fresh banger*
WE MAKING IT OUT OF LAP 3 WITH THIS ONE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
lap π when?
I’d honestly love for you to do Slice of Mayhem (fan made “Final Lap” music), I seriously wanna see your take on it  While I’m here, another suggestion is Pasta La Vista, another fanmade lap 3 theme. Both are awesome, and I’d love to see your take on them.
Glad you didint include the topping gals
short but very good i love it
Peppino just becose like sonic .exe so creeapy
YES
Now infinite lap it.
cooolllllll
.... don't tell him about the minus 8 toppins mod...
2:17 Hey, I didn't know that I was in this video!
YOOOOOOOOOO
When you get sick of losing in a game
Now do Absolute AbsurZiti next! If you can do lap 4 with snick😈...
Something something Icarus, whatever, it’s Pizza Tower, this game has as much lore as a warm sponge.
The 3rd lap has arrived
As someone who recently had a crisis about the sheer length of infinity this is terrifying. More terrifying than pizza time never ends
Love how they hint to the fact lap 3 IS a mod and incorporate that into the thing. Also I love how pizzaface is concerned
1:46 INFINITE  *L A P S!* Peppino! Stop make it about the toppins on PIZZA! *Its too dangerous!*
Now, maybe distasteful anchovi?
Yep. Peppino has absolutely lost what little sanity he had left. He just wants to watch the world burn, and he isn't gonna stop until he burns along with it.
I love how peppino's extreme anxiety from previous lyric videos has now turned into absolute insanity craving for more and more challenges and chaos It just describes the community in such a funny absolutely chaotic way lmao  Absolutely love it.
peppino is a furry
Mod OG's 1:57 Playable Eevee 2:12 Playable Wario 2:14 Playable Pinkie Pie 2:17 The Goofy Ahh Puffer Fish 2:19 Peppina Ramen Over Peppino
People in 3023 doing lap 582
“Thank cheesy goodness all o’ that poppycock was fake” “Is that-a so?” “Oh phooey” Why is that so funny?
Me when I alter reality.
let’s GOOO
THIS BOTH COLD AND FIRE 🔥❄️🔥❄️🔥❄️ ❄️❄️❄️🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥❄️❄️❄️ ❄️🔥❄️🔥❄️🔥
If Lap 3 ever comes back to Pizza Tower, Pillar Johns revenge should become official as tribute to the fans, kinda like Peddito and The Goise.
HOLY SH!$ the is very great
Cool
This is so fantastic and fun I never figured the song would get to this point but it's so awesome to see the talent behind all the remixes and especially this Truly amazing stuff 👍
I think peppino has lost his mind, the dude literally turned himself into an eevee and didn't bat an eye
Man went from keeping what little shred of sanity he had left to spam adding mods to fuel the overinflated insanity of making what he calls “The perfect run”
Now mr. Stick’s comment of “Peppino are you insane” in lap 1 makes perfect sense
Nice song! I cannot wait to hear unexpectancy with lyrics!
Nice dude i was waiting for this
2:30 HOW MANY LAPS?!
congrats you gained a sub
Pizzahead at the end is like “oh no”
The Eevee shoutout caught me off guard 11/10
FUN FACT: this cover takes place on the pizza oven engine  to install mods for pizza tower
#PillarJohnRevenge
I feel just as speechless in my life seeing how this cover gone phenomenal out of my expectations. Another fine job well done for all the work you done RecD and your team man.
repeticion 3
0:01 I love the fact that pizza oven is a modding tool for installing mods into pizza tower, and it’s portrayed into a actual pizza oven
The real challenge began... Changing the subject you should do a song where peppino meets peppina ramen (just a suggestion)
Lap 4?
Pappino transforming into an Eevee, Wario, Pinke Pie, a giant blowfish and Peppina is just amazing. I loved how Wario based on Warioland and Pinkie Pie due to her liking to bake.
ohh i get it "pizza oven", the name of the pt mod installer and he's like ohhhhhhhhhhh
That Eevee part caught me so off guard, holy hell😂
Guys note the Pizza oven is spposed to be the app called Pizza oven for modding thats why the pizza oven has ultimate power to change things
Greatest Music Of Pizza Tower I ever Heard
From the bosses standpoint, After the game is beaten peppino is just an all powerfull god that can't be beaten. A mad man obsessed with re-living the thrill of beating every single lap, Every single boss, Every. Single. Mod.    Also fake peppino being like "WHO ARN'T YOU PEOPLE" is hilarious to me and I don't know why
12/6/2023 2:30
Peppino has lost it and I’m all for it
at the beginning of the video they referenced the pt modding system called pizza oven
Bet
pizza
YEWEEE
So many various nods and references, and in such little time! Impressive :D
I like instead of breaking the fourth wall it is baking the fourth a wall
I make my on pizza tower people out of card Bord
W h a t
I like how the lap number at 2:30 references the date pizza tower came out
bro did 1 trillion laps around the same level-
peppermans voice:🗿
. . .
Imagine sugary spire
just you wait till you learn about the other 30 laps 💀
AS AN EEVEE!!!!
what the next pizza tower song
Absolutely brilliant
lap 4?
Peppino has definitely gone insane, or at least more
Peppino put a lil more than oregano on his pizza this time
One more lap to prove peppino’s stronger and wiser and faster ‼️‼️‼️‼️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love how the oven used in the video is meant to represent Pizza Oven (A Pizza Tower Mod Manager) and every pizza cooked in it is meant to represent a mod.
Like how clear it is that Peppino is just completely off his rocker here.
sonic.exe be like 2:52
😍 dis is so good👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
get your 20 minutes or less ticket here
“Just one slip up and I’m certain to fail”  Me on my final exams
HE'S LOST HIS FUCKING MINED
WERE MAKING IT OUT OF THE PIZZA TOWER WITH THIS ONE🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Mods...lap3........LAP HELL!
no words can describe what ive wittnesed
huh lap 1262023... 12/6/2023... either looking too deep into this or that's a release date for something
I literally joined the premiere when he turned into an eevee, and that was a pleasant surprise.
Bro finally lost it💀
This is the best song from @recd I've ever heard 🎉
Maybe Peppino show overpower that he can take down different universes like like Sonic Mario Zelda Mickey takeover games like he's gets so powerful that he can just take over games maybe he can take over Roblox maybe he was a glitch into real life I don't know what peppina would do but oh my God😬😬😬😬😬
I have hered
This is the best lap (or should I say laps) you have ever covered. Thanks a lot for this. <3 Love this so much!
this slaps so hard bro
also Pepita is going hard like this is what happens when you get crazy with mods good luck Recd
Its-a ready!
2:30 peppino as evie just saw pizzahead with a little bit of modding
I’m… genuinely astonished by this one. The lyrics were perfect, the reference to Lap 2 With Lyrics, and of course the references to other mods and the overall perfect depiction of people just being so masochistic with the “challenges” they put themselves through. This was just amazing through and through, probably one of my personal favorite “With Lyrics” videos to date. Keep being amazing, man.
Can you do the sugary spire song?
I'm just glad I'm not a pizza chef. Too much Lapping...   Is ''Lapping'' even a word?
Every redditer in a nutshell
love that peppino is now insane for no reason
😮😮😮😮😮 What in the world are you doing peppino is psychic insanity
This song perfectly captures the mood of lap 3/ infinite laps, whether it be courage, stupidity, or a want to prove yourself, you ran into the portal, most will call you insane but to you it’s just another lap and crave to prove something, you might not know who your trying to prove, but you know you won’t stop until you “win” if you even can, after all you have infinity to practice and be perfect.
Should have added the pizza tower multiplayer mod as well
peppino goes insane (with lyrics)
This is literally Pizza Tower United in a nutshell song.
Finally! I like pepperman and vigilante voice actors🤩🤩🤩🤩
1:13 wait is peppino remerber snick ?
1:55  Bro ALMOST made a Spongebob reference
WE ALMOST GETTING ABSOLUTE ABSURZITY (LAP 4!!!!)
What just happened I never new you could mod the game that what
We making it out of noises studio with this one
Why the hell did this make my chest feel funny after the end
HE'S BACK A IT Y'ALL WOOO-
Peppino when he realizes that he is going to crash the game at lap 2560000900000 something (32 bit integer limit)
I thought lap 3 was real, until they pulled out the playable eevee
I honestly cant wait for the Unexpectancy fight song(s)!
Dear god... Peppino has discovered the power of game mods!
"INFINITE LAPS, WHILE FIGHTING ALL THE BOSSES-" "where am I?" "What in tarnation?" "Time to crush Peppino already?" "WHO AREN'T-A YOU PEOPLE!?" "AS AN EEVEE!"
saw the premiere! very cool and I DID NOT PREDICT THE MODS OR PEPPEEVEE
This got me funky be like:  0:20
Lap 4 !!!!!!!!
1:51 Pepperman:"Where am i?"                   Vigilante: "What in tartation?"                     Noise: "Is it already time to crush peppino already?"            Fake peppino: "WHO ARENT-A YOU PEOPLE?!"      Man fake peppino really is the one that realised 💀
Nice
Peppino has lost his mind over one level confirmed
I feel like something going to be released on December 6 2023… I say this sine the Lap number has a date on it near the end
Lap 1: wants peppino to fail Lap 2: pissed/confused Lap 3: scared and concerned pizzaface's character development
Pepino was like yeah 100 laps 58 Poppins I want to play the game of Eevee
This is unironically a perfect representation of Lap 3, holy shit...!
oh my god he did it
Lap 3!!1!1!11!1!1
Peppino's gone crazy!
THEY CALLED HIM PEPPINO
Oh, dear, hope Snick.EXE doesn't come to kick his Italian fourth-wall breaking ass yet... That would cause him to lose both his laps- AND HIS LIFE EXPECTANCY.
I'm the thousandth like wooohoo
12 6 2023 is that a coincidence?
I can't believe Peppino Spaghetti became Sonic.exe real smh 😔
I like it but I miss the fnf with lyrics videos
oo this is cool
We need lap4 lyrcic
HOLY SH*T, PEPPINO
THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
At the end was the a sonic exe reference?
imagine then blue blur chef from boll tower
I love how it references the Mod manager pizza oven by making it an actual pizza oven that makes magic pizzas. Also, it was fun seeing peppino play god
THAT SONG SLAPS ASF
Its you're 300 video
this song really fits  some pizza tower fans keep wanting more and more difficult challenges
2:29 cant believe that peppino made it to lap 1262023
Lord this was GREAt 👍
Yo uhh....  When pepper man boss with lyrics coming?
Fire
I have three things to say. 1. I like how he uses a pizza oven to cook the mods when the pizza tower mod engine is called pizza oven. 2. I like how the ending is a sonic.exe reference. 3. I love the pinkie pie mod and glad it showed up.
lap 4 next
*ONE. MORE. LAP!!*  Alright, shall I be the first to say this but... I think this is the peak of RecD's Pizza Tower vids, although its even sure to get better! The amount of adrenaline and hype you can get easily from the song, with LYRICS INCLUDED, and the amount of MOD REFERENCES!! It's like a road trip down memory lane, even if Pizza Tower has only been here for only months! Thank you, Tom, for going into the Pizza Oven, and cooking up the peakest of peaks for us! Here's to many more peaks!  *Also WAIT. PEPPINA!!?? THE MAHOU MOD!!??*
The fact fake peppino doesn't even know who the other bosses are truly shows how isolated he was.
Bro really went down the rabbit hole of madness
Peppino.Exe real, hide your pizzas
WE PUNCHIN PILLAR JOHN WITH THIS ONE 🔥🔥🔥🗣️ 🗣️🗣️🗣️
Peppino:so many mods so little time wouldn't you agree... Sonic.exe:THATS MY LINE!!
I'm not trapped in here with you, you're trapped in here with me. Absolutely golden 😂
As a person whose just pizza arrived This is a massive win
I love pizza oven reference
THIS ISH SLAPS HARDER THAN MY MOMS BELT!
I don't get this we making out meme
Peppino has been beaten up and cornered by many time to time again. So seeing him just toy with Pizza Face and even the other bosses with infinite laps and infinite transformations is kinda sweet, and yet, very chaotic. Peppino really went too far with this one. He's gone insane from being pushed around, you can tell. Good thing it was all just a dream, but also a bit of a bad thing. This might actually be my favorite installment in the series!
YOOO FIRST TIME HEARING PIZZAHEAD, VIGILANTE, AND PEPPERMAN!!!
It just ended and yeah it also just started I love it
Peppino.exe? 2:52
This is the greatest one you made it’s so cool that you add more laps make a peeper man battle
"✨Perfection✨"
Bars. ACTUAL bars.✨  This was so, so fun. I just love how you sound for Peppino, especially when yelling or going crazy. It just adds that much more to the emotion.  And the multifandom thing at the end with Eevee and various other characters? That was fun. Absolutely love it.✨
10 / 10
I did not expect the pinkie pie and eevee mod to apear in this fire song?!
HECK YEA
I’m sorry seeing Peppino become a furry and a god among men was not on my to-do list today…
The mods designs are amazing! Well i have mods too, Well done for making lap 3 RecD, IF HE MAKES LAP 4.... THEN IM GONNA BE EXCITED!
The fact that Peppino is not even a little scared and is just messing with mods makes it so much better     Edit: JESUS CHIRST IM THE MAIN COMMENT AND HAVE MORE LIKE THAN THEN THE PINNED COMMENT AND THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO BE BEFORE AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF…. ALL THIS HAPPENED IN LESS THAN A DAY THANK YOU GUYS.
Alternate version for this song: Peppino goes Mod Mad
HE BAKED THE FOURTH WALL AND LITERALLY TURNED INTO A POKEMON FROM THAT ONE MOD BY *PATAFOIN* LIKE HOLY RAVIOLI RECD WHAT THE HECK DUDE
I need It's Pizza Time! But with Plume (Eevee) lyrics.  Unlike Peppino, Plume seem to be silly and crazy, but lack anxiety.
Cool references from the mods
waiting for sugary spire songs with lyrics
Very good lyrics vid rec d! Just one more lap….
LOL THIS IS FIRE
"oh phooey"   famous last words
Great
oh shit that was great
"So many mods, so little time", sent-a chills down my spine... Edit:Holy s^&t I'm famous
this was very awesome, good work!
OH GOD HE HAS MODS!!
WHAT THE HELL THAT WAS INSANE
peak
Nice-a!
i cant wait for lap 4 with lyrics
bro became Peppino.exe at the end
OMG so many details to talk about -Peppino saying “and for the first course.. lap 3..” made me think that there will be a lap 4 with lyrics. Well the final part of the song has me shocked lol -Also hearing that Vigilante actually has a VA shocked me too -Love how Pizzaface is concerned as to WHY Peppino is going for a 3rd lap and wanting more than just lap 3 -Thumbnail is WAY more different than the previous 2 lap songs: Pizza Time Peppino is frantic to find the stuff and leave, Lap 2 Peppino is confident of defying death, in this one, Pizzaface and John’s ghost are the ones that are scared instead of Peppino -If I’m looking correctly, the lap Peppino is on at the end of the song, 1262023 it could mean something or probably nothing
Holy shit, Peppino Spaghetti transcended his own game, and in his lust for more challenge, BAKED THE 4TH WALL AND WANTS MORE i think this might the peak. Also, i love how Peppino's modding reality and the Pizza Tower itself through a fucking oven, *Pizza Oven.*
"Who aren't-a you people?" Made me laugh in my head.
I LOVE IT
Most hilarious video so far lol, keep up the great work!
insanity.
HE WENT FUCKING MAD.
This is the definition of crazy
bro broke the fourth wall way too much
FNF TABI

Weeeeeelllll...... pizzahead did it. Peppino snapped, and its not good. For ANYONEA
Short, but great ( also, a( i think intentional) sonic.exe reference at the end)
Comedy. The TOP of the CROP.
Loved it
This was so fire that peppino turned into some random characters
THIS SONG WAS A BANGER
