How is this a horror movie
I don't care what happens to rich folks.
In January 5 2024
This was such a fun trailer to watch before five nights at Freddy's I'll never forget watching it for the first time and seeing all of the amazing characters especially Izzy
ممكن اعرف اسم الفلم
Bad movie
W H Y .  How can someone be inspired by The Natural and Signs.. and concoct something so terrible.
A movie not made for adult.... More like teenagers.
I liked the part where there was a pool.
good movie
Se ve que es bien malita.
Se ve genial
I'm starting to think Blumhouse is just another scam, , it's in nearly every frigging horror trailer,  to sell whatever crap to you.  Is there any horror movie that doesn't feature Blumhouse these days.
“Ronan ur dead” no u r lol
Cool movie.
Cat dies so it’s a no for me
Used to play Marco Polo all the time
I watched this movie it was so good , and turns out I didn’t know the people who made this also made megan .😅😅
I heard her great grandfather went missing in 1945. As a family moved into and old home and had it remodeled a decomposed body was found in a wall space near the fireplace. They did a dna check on the remains. They found out it was her great grandad. The offical Hide and Seek champion of 1945!
Wow, even by horror movie douchbag boyfriend standards, that guy's a bad, lol
Dumbest & boring plot ever. Waste of time 3/10
Pool look like she swimming in the ocean tf
4:21 pm April 7th 2025
I’m about to watch this movie for the first time
A really good movie! To the casting director: Great job for casting the two young actors who actually look like their actor parents. I hadn't seen such a good cast since Jane campion's "an angel at my table".
Definately not a scary movie like will steal your night sleep but yes surely a enjoyable movie that i can say.
Good movie

She peed in the pool? thats pure horror right there!
Why is he offering to make a pool with monsters in it
night swims were always terrifying and ive never seen anyone enjoy ghem but now its even scarier
They brought together James Wan and Jason Blum. This should've been a masterpiece... I'd rather watch 3 hours of National geography about octopy mating instead of this movie. 2/10 👎
This movie had a great concept, unfortunately it was written and directed terribly. Wayyyy too many holes in logic to make it actually make sense. If the goal was to scare someone with an IQ of 30, you did a great job.
1:43
Those who haven't seen the movie can watch it. It's a very horror movie.
Haunted pool? Well alright then.
Bosan gila cite ni. Tak seram langsung. Nyesal tengok. 03/10
THe CAT BETTER have NOT DIED
I watched the movie. CREEPY AS HE-
Blumhouse really went to the bottom of the bin of last years discarded ideas to dig out this one... Cm'on mate... A haunted pool?
Uh oh a pet cat!
This was the scariest trailer I’ve ever seen and I am a twenty seven year old  person
Layn3altabonmkom film dial zeb ya wlad l97ab
😝😝😝
This movie was definitely dooky
*Well, lol, that looked boring.*
Movie name?
Please tell me the cat is okay !
Is this trailer a challenge of who can survive the longest without Fallin asle
I think the scariest pools are wave pools, there's people constantly dying in those
Movie name : Night swim
Tratto da America Dad
just dont go in the pool

Dont worry guys i get toasters i will   Throw the toaster the water

Wooow my phobia in a movie 🍿 is
I know like bu
I consider movies like this one as "background movies for when you're doing anything but watching it".
I couldn’t even get through this movie after the first half hour. Everything about it was so stupid. Total disappointment from Blumhouse.
I could swim at night in a pool that size and imagine there's a shark in it to the point my pulse gets faster and I get out before being eaten. I have closed my eyes and dunked my head back in a bathtub, while imagining I was really on the sinking Titanic and scared myself. Shut up. I know you are.
I have watched this movie at 1:45 pm today
I can't watch this until I know that the cat is okay 🫣🙀
98 minutes of my life that I’ll never get back…
What a fucking shit of movie HAHAHAHAHA
I expected it to be bad but was actually ok😂
I would never have heard of this if not for BowserVids / Onyx
I’ve never seen anyone so determined to play Marco Polo
this movie was hilariously stupid
Alcohol and night swimming. They're a winning combination.
"Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water..."
You know the reason B movies work is because they don’t have the budget that these major Hollywood production companies do; so they seem charming and endearing- like the people who made them were actually doing their best with what they have. These “schlocky” B-movie high budget rip offs really do just come off as lazy
My gosh this movie was horrendous. 1/10, atrocious film, nothin at all was scary about it. Do don’t recommend at all
So what's the trama? She spends all the movie in that pool? I don't get it
What a horrible movie this is 👎👎👎 💩
Was about to just blind play this at 1 am alone, thank god for trailers 😅
they made an entire movie about the irrational anxiety of closing your eyes in the shower
She’s not opening her eyes because she has no UV. Chloramines are a bitch
Great movie! Well worth watching 👍
Ok pendiente también 😊
Watching it now. The opening scenes were less than encouraging. Snoooze alarm so far. Maybe they just had to get the mandatory color out of the way.
Just finished this movie. It was shit
And maybe there's some horrific nudity in this pool?
Its giving “What Lies Beneath” vibes
So there’s a monster living inside the pool? 😂
Stop the sexualization of teen girls!!! Having grown women in every movie to play 14-15 year olds so they can promote the idea of teen girl corn!! What is wrong with these directors and especially what is wrong with actors in the movie not speaking up! Why is the camera filming her backside??! What a sick world!
That's not how the marco polo scene actually played out btw
Shout out to Harold Holt, the Australian prime minister who disappeared while going for a swim.
When this came on during the previews for another movie at the cinema I thought it was a commercial at first 💀
I love a good scary movie, but 47.50 into this & after the Marco polo game, I lost interest, completely ran out of patience.
Is she blind? Why can’t she just open her eyes?
I actually really enjoyed this movie.
Marco......cholo
Minor turbulence
These comments are killing me, dumb movie nothing scary
bokdan bi filim
I had a night swim today and I haven't even been eaten once, I want my money back
This is why you should not swim at night
This movie was so shit holy fuck
Scary movie directors:   “We gotta start this with them moving to a new house where people were people were already killed”
Ok well now I’m terrified of ever going in my pool again😭😭and I was just getting over my fear of my pool and sharks
my parents and old swim coaches used to tell me that the “pool monster” was hiding in the pool pump room when i was a kid, so i KNOW this shit is gonna scare me
OPEN YOUR DAMN EYES YOU BOZO!!!
The movie sucks like a lot of
This has got to be the gheyyyyyest movie ever.
I think the only thing about this movie 🎬 is that it is not a horror movie that is short for horrible movie
It was more of a baseball movie than a horror
ass

If no one answers you after that period of time, you open your eyes to see no one there and then you climb out, dumb ass fake scenario.
Evil swimming pool (bad film)
Reminds me of the Dead Man's float episode of Are you afraid of the dark, still gonna watch this, love James Wan
i hate how the trailer really gave us nothing lmao just a girl in a pool!? is that what the entire movie is?? just a girl swimming..
Um filme sobre uma piscina mal assombrada? hiduahuifasfuih
Awful. I thought it was Kristen Davis was in it. But it’s not
this movie was bad
I watch this movie already. I got a jump scare.
Okay now this is good
This movie cost $15,000,000 to make 🤣

Cox super ❤  ve dramatikdi
man these new horror movies never fail to disappoint with the third acts. i was enjoying it until the lame ass final 30 minutes
If this girl doesn't open her eyes. Got me yelling at this phone 😂😂
hell nah
Token Finnadookie.
In the final release of the movie, Woke producers replaced this scene with Italian actors re-enacting Marco Polo's discovery of the Mongol Empire.
It’s safer to swim with someone not alone
she really did close her eyes the entire time
This creepy horror flick at least had a little substance and scares, and a stand out performance from Oscar nominated Kerry Condon.
I expected way more. Brutal movie imo
Looks stupid
So the ghost of Marco Polo gets his revenge on generations of swimmers who turned his proud moniker into a silly kid's game??
Came back to remove my like. This movie was terrible.
Non sense 😂😂
Movie was good!
I can't wait to watch this movie! 🎞
Another Bum house fail 🥱
Thought this movie was about Sharks !🦈
They definitely should have used REM song Night Swimming
Pool are basically giant bidets. Hot tubs as well. Gross
One gets so many idea and one thinks "This would make a great movie". This is one of them. Like the rest of them, they dont actually make goode movies. This is crap.
this was a 5/10 for me
I Never Knew it til sam and colby introduced it
Cake
Horror movie begins with a family moving into a house... Ooo you know this gon be... absolute garbage
HOW DO YOU GO FROM MAKING SAW TO MAKING NIGHT SWIM????
I’m not a Marco Polo swimmer you got one time to go silent I’m getting out the pool 🤗
Luschek
Swimming at night has always terrified me… and yet I grew up swimming and boating on a lake!
This is just the plot of Jennifer McMahon's THE DROWNING KIND and I don't understand why no one is mentioning it.

Spoilers below.      If they were serious, they would have filled it in with cement instead of dirt.
It's always the new houses
WHAT A SHIT TRAILER
Yeah.. I'm not watching a movie when I just know the cat is going to die just from watching the trailer 😅
Bom dia❤
Lee Shaw
Wasn’t scary at all. And how do you make a whole movie out of this?
The worst movie of all movies omg
I can't believe Wan signed on that. First half of the movie 7/10. Second one 2/10.
This was literally the dumbest movie to start the year off.  Freaking snoozefest!  I got a full refund before the credits rolled, don't waste your time!
Finished watching it. Im scared of pools now!😢😢😢
Stay out of the fricking pool, buy a couple truckloads of fill- dirt, and be done with it. Problem solved. Ffs.
Udah nonton. Ternyata tentang *tumbal* ya
This looks ok 👍 if you like to be scared 😱 to go see. Another cheap thrill.
looks boring
😂
This looks so bad, idk wtf yall about
I don't understand why every horror movies has the ghost/devil etc you name it, playing with lights, turning things on and off. Dude, isn't your face scary enough? Stop that archaic formulae pls.
Look like it sucked 😕
det e jo nøkken dette her
Was alright but not sure as scary as it could have been
i watched the movie with two of my friends, it was so good !!
if you want your daughter never swim just let her watch this .. 😁😁
Fucking boring wasted movie
I saw this in theatres about 2 weeks ago with 4 of my friends. Scared me bro😭✋🏻
DONT WATCH THIS! i just watched this awhile ago... i just fell asleep.... its sooooo boring! i guess ive watched better horror movies in the past
Watched and good scary though not the level of best
Not bad. Only the title can be something else. I love horror movies
Probably a waste of money.... because this trailer did no justice
A 16 yr old girl encounters a pool monster during a game of Marco polo 🤦‍♂️ Ile pass !
This has got to be the worst horror movie ever. James Wan downfall.
Jus stop going in the pool?
This movie was dope asf 10/10 its underated i think cuz of the name its not catchy but def a gem movie
If the cat gets hurt then.....no.
🔥🔥
movie suck dick
That’s why these younger generations don’t know about calling “FISH OUT OF WATER!”
idk....it's a pool. Why didn't they go with a lake? A lot of things can be hidden in there...
We called this jinn some kind of jinn lliving in wtar
The bullshit movie I have ever seen!
I watched and I recommend itt!! 8/10
horseshit
One of the worst movie with the best trailer ever ‼️
There's A Mermaid Monster In The Pool
Q bosta de filme
I watch this movie totally worse
the worst movie ever
I loved the idea of this movie. I just hate that in almost every horror movie they have to kill off the pet Pisses me off
My brother sneaked into the movie at the cinema its 18+ and hes 16 LMFAO

Fui a verla ayer y me gustó mucho..interesante,enigmática,misteriosa..hacía tiempo q no disfrutaba tanto con una película d terror,la recomiendo
The longest simplest trailer ever
When the kid knew how dangerous the pool is haunted but still go look for a cat in the pool, jeez, its like they know where the evil is but still go towards it
😢😅😅😅😅i really wanna try swim in the night my friend do so at the beach we do have giant 🔥 i can not even at the pool with lights let not talk of beach tf 😂🤧🤣😅 its freaking dark 🌑 that aside my brain keeps telling me there's something in there don't try it 😅😅😅😅😅
what the fuck is this about
What's with americans and their dum8 houses being haunted?
How come it feels like every newer  horror movie seems to be the same ...

4/10 on Imdb. And after watching it myself, I'm not surprised. Seems Hollywood is incapable of doing good horror movies anymore.
İnteresting movie idea 😮
Gizemli dizilere bayılıyorum oldukça ilginç ve merak uyandırdı 👍
Kesinlikle tavsiye edebileceğim bir film
Harika bir film
Movie really dives into the fears of swimming at night and alone. It’s a real thriller with a twist 😊

Su hayattır. Zevkle izleyeceğiniz  bir film. Şimdiden iyi seyirler
Güzel
Çok güzel filim
Ok
Çok güzel bir film ve sinemaydı
muhteşem olmuş baya gericiye benziyo
Çok güzel film tavsiye ederim
Bunun yakında geleceğini biliyordum. Blumhouse'u seviyorum
Kesinlikle tavsiye edebileceğim bir film👌
Çok güzel bir film tavsife ederim
I don't know why, in every horror movie, the beginning is very good, but then it starts to get very bad, I think it's time to write a different story.
Yüksek gerilimli müthiş bir filim daha geldi.
I wonder about this
Hikayesi sürükleyici gibi duruyor herşeyden az az var
Saw this. Sucked.
Jeez, she kept her eyes closed for three to five business days
What next, Return of the killer closet.
What a crappy trailer, just a girl bobbing about in a pool, saying Marco Marco Marco Marco, seriously???????
really. this is what horror is now.
This movie is ass
Are most of the comments bots? This looks terrible
You know... This is effective marketing. Lure me in with the pretty girl then give me a shit movie.
good movie, we really enjoyed it.
Best Movie ❤❤❤
All happy until Blumhouse logo appears, then you know everything's gonna go shit.
😂, I totally recommend this movie, please go watch it and bring children. I hope it'll be more successful than Jaws, and get 💯 sequels. Enough swimming pools near the coasts and drying rivers! Please enjoy! 🎉🎉
He is WAY to young for her.
She was really dedicated to that game.
When you're forced to write a low budget movie cause you're an entry level screen writer and you end up making total crap.
Theres no point in this movie, pretty basic boring typa horror film not really much goes on. Not alot of creativity at all not even really scary. 2/10 rate maybe
Movie was shit. Dont watch this
stupid kid or stupid story the kid didn't tell exactly where he sees someone one  somewhere on the pool
❤terrible, straight to dvd movie. Watch if you want something to help you sleep.
The Waller family is so dysfunctional.
This trailer made me wanna go take a pee.
scary pool filter/drain i have a pool drain/filter phobia so thats why i didnt go see this movie :'(
I absolutely adore Wyatt Russell, but this movie is not good. Hahahah
naw
This just feels like a mash up of many other films
I’m going to see this movie today. I’ve been watching horror films since I was a baby. I will let you know what I think.
I left the movie theatres after seeing the lil girl leave her house just for a boat in the pool for one she’s not going out at night to get a boat in the pool that she got woken up from lol and two who tf in the right mind will let there kid go out at night I’ll beat the shit out my kids for doing that so this movie started out fake and I know it probably was boring so I made an decision and left😂
water demon seeking vengence for every human who has ever pissed in that pool.
This was by far the worst movie
trash
بخزي
Best movie.
Goofy ahh trailer
Cool!
I was rooting for Cider! :(((((((((((((((((((((
Yow the first time some weird stuff happen  with me in that pool I am not going anywhere near it
Movie ya crazy  who come up with these movies yowww honestly
I just finished watching this movie. Paid 20 dollars HOPING for something decent. In my opinion, this is far away from being a horror movie. Now I'm upset for the 20 dollars I wasted on this movie. I will give it a 1 out of 10... And I am being generous.
Did the ending make anyone else so mad? 🤦🏽‍♀️
REM wrote a song about this movie
This movie was trash lol
I used to think the lines at the bottom of the pool were hammerhead sharks lol
She must of committed some sort of serious crime for Batman to do her like that
Pretty tame for blumhouse, dissapointing.
This movie was just okay. I love horror, I’m a fan of horror, but this movie wasn’t the best. It was just alright
worst movie ever
This looks dumb AF, I'll still watch it though lmao
When Lifetime and Shudder has a baby.😂
and then you think about swimming in the pool at all. 😜
Okay.
nightmare swim is more like it...
No wonder why hollywood keeps recycling franchises. This is the dumbest idea. How about a huanted kitchen next
As soon as I see any James Wan or Blumhouse involvement in any production, then I'm already in for it.
so yall gon just ignore the fact that her scream was still audbile while she was underwater? ok.
American bullshit
Gw liat di situs rating ny 5,pdhl produksi universal...sejelek itukh film ny..🤔

It features John Walker / US AGENT
YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO SAY “POLO!”
i was just looking for a movie to go see with my friend but this is perfect because she loves horror... i dont but if she wants to watch it ill watch it
I will go
I'm definitely going to see this. I love horror movies Aa 😅
A trashy rip off of a are you afraid of the dark episode god you people are soo stupid and why we never get good movies anymore when stupid people will pay to see shit they seen before blame everyone here who thinks this trash will be good when it's a rip off of a kids show
Just seen, shockingly bad. 0/10.
Şahane bir film izlemeye tevsiye ediyorum 🎉
Çok iyi filim
Bu film bana tüm nostalji hislerini veriyor.  90'lı yıllarda çocuktum ve Are You Afraid of the Dark'ı izleyerek büyüdüm.  Dead Man's Float diye bir bölüm vardı ve beni çok korkuttu.  Havuzun içinde yaşayan bir canavar hakkındaydı.  O bölümü izledikten sonra geceleri havuzumuzda yüzmeye korktum.  Bunu izleyeceğim için gerçekten heyecanlıyım!
Harika anlar ve mutluluk
Wasn't that good !!! If there was a Croc in the pool would have been better!
This movie will discourage everyone from owning a swimming pool.
i watch that today and it is a disappointment movie and its not that scary 😡
Another stup1d plot of cheap horror movies
POLO
I find plot like this incredibly idiotic. Who came up with story like this? If there is something inside their pool, all they had to do is block off the pool and avoid going in it. Simple as that. Only takes 1 second to reach the ending. The trailer just spared me from wasting time with this movie.
I seen the movie today, it wasn't bad.
one of the worst movie i ever watched
1:52 that sound ... noice
Didn't really care for this movie..
This is the "scariest" swimming pool of All Time.
Cannot wait to see this 🔥🔥
One if the worst horror films of all time
Am i supposed to be scared?
Looks really good
how dumb lol😊
10/10 movie!
How is still giving this guy money to make the same movie over and over and over again
where can I watch this movie?
Just watched the movie, I loved it!
I love when a trailer shows the entire movie 🙃 (the other trailer that is)
I go to the cinema  with my family and watching this movie scary ..
it's dogshit xDDDDDDDDDDDD
LOOKS LIKE HOLLYWOOD IS RUNNING OUT OF IDEAS FOR MOVIES SO THEY ARE JUST FILMING TRASH
Wokeness alert
Would have been much stronger if it ended before it said polo and grabbed her.  Just her saying marco alone until cut.
Garbage movie
Was intrigues till I realize it was directed by the same guy that directed the nun
this movie is the reverse of scary lol
0:20 kitty 🥹💜
I used to drive out to my local lake and swim alone all the time at night. There’s nothing better than floating on your back in cold water, looking at the moon and stars with no one on site
Any film trailer that makes my vagina instantly weep is a must watch day one for me!
Highly recommend!
"neither audiences nor critics were fond of “Night Swim,” which holds a dismal 27% on Rotten Tomatoes and landed a “C” CinemaScore. "  -- Variety.  Why????  Because there is no gore or "f" bombs???
The problem with BLUM HOUSE is, they always have GREAT ideas, but poorly execute those ideas. This movie is far from scary or even thrilling. It's a generic bland Hollywood scary story film. The acting had no real emotion behind it, the story is nothing but stale bread & quite honestly this film is nothing but a carbon copy of "Are You Afraid of the Darks" "Tale of the Dead Mans Float". Honestly my recommendation, don't waste your money & wait till some TV channel runs it as its day time movie.
This just added another reason to the 19 other reasons why I would NEVER own a pool
Saw it today and it was really good and it’s definitely underrated according to Rotten Tomatoes
Surprised when it was a really good horror story about a haunted pool built on top on a long gone pond with dangerous powers who took some of its users down into the eternal deep for ever.👍
Some Pool Things
Saw the movie just now, there was four dead pixels that kept appearing in nearly all the shots. Not sure if it was the theatre or the movie itself. Since the pixels weren’t in all the shots I’m inclined to believe the movie was shot on a camera with a bad sensor.
On what planet is this movie even made? Like that family could even afford that house. Giant yard, pool, what is it, like 1.2 mil?
Girl I would’ve been opened up my eyes or said fish out of water
If the cat dies, I ain't fkn watching it
Flesh Wound Features Podcast Movie Review of Night Swim   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMJWFMtoeVA&t=383s
Is it out
U all gotta be lying in these comments bro
I love her dedication to not once opening her eyes.
I saw this trailer when i was going to watch the fnaf movie
Does nobody else think it’s laughably retarded that the demon plays Marco Polo?
Seeing this today lol
Why can't she just fully open her eyes when he's not responding ? is she stupid ?
Реально пугает
Mükemmel bir film herkese tavsiye ederim
Mükemmel bir film olmuş ❤
Çok kyifli
Was about to buy a ticket on Fandango. Thanks for showing me that this is just going to be woke trash so I know not to give you money. Hollywood starting off 2024 about as expected. Maybe by 2026 you’ll have to close up shop.
Fear of swimming alone unlocked
the concept feels very stephen king and i'm all for it
I love it when the all the scares are in the trailer, so I don't actually have to watch this piece of shit.
The three minute short of it was done so much better.
This looks truly.. terrible
Not scary at all, weak CGI monsters and story was very poor. My score 44/100
Mükemmeldi..
İnanılmaz film

Another family move to a new home type of movie 😂😂😂
Got my tickets for tomorrow
Seimming in general is scary but dark waters and swimming at night fuck no 😭😱
I’m actually looking forward to this. Haven’t seen a good horror film in a while!
Girl open your god damn eyes and get out of the pool. Whats this nonsense? If I don’t get an answer after the second time I’m out!! Besides that, No I tried it once it actually scary as hell to swim in an outside pool at night and on your own.
Never Watch This Movie Ever Again
I can't wait
If that cat drowns i'm gonna be pissed.
It’s giving “Dead Man’s Float” episode of Are You Afraid of the Dark? 😂
the gongoozler…
Welp looks like I’m not gonna be swimming at night no more 🤧
This is going to be the best/worst movie
Damn looks amazing but the one thing i would of done in that situation is fill the pool till its like a big bottle of holy water😂
Girl Marko ‽‽‽P0LØ
(....... "Lady, why aren't you smart?"....)       Is what I was thinking.
So stupid😂. Everyone knows that if "polo" doesn't speak up. Marco is gonna blow up about the other person cheating. This trailer irks.
but Dad it's only scary in the deep end .  😵‍💫😱👀🏊‍♀🏊‍♂😈👹🤡😱😳  hehe😁😁 great trailer . i blame the pool guy poor cleaning 💚💚😳🙋‍♂
Yes won’t swim by myself no more for sure ewwww
I’ve never been afraid of swimming in the pool at night… until now.
And I thought swimming with reef sharks at shark feeding time (8:00-11:00) was scary…
this has to be the worst concept idea for a movie ive ever seen, saw it elsewhere and thought id see what people were saying about this trailer on yt, i cant believe people eat this crap up lmao.
If Black people lived at this house they’d be fine. If you know, you know😁  ***And no, this isn’t a racist post
Horror movie right there on my TV horror movie right there on my TV got to see more.and even at 64 we still love horror movies on my TV.
انه الأروع
جميييل
Isn’t that the house from La Llarona?
Is this because I haven't pooled, in 36 years?
❤❤❤❤
Wasn’t a haunted swimming pool the plot of an “Are You Afraid of the Dark” episode?
🤬 🤬 🤬 🤬
😡 😡 😡 😡
what a good concept, glad somebody is using a semi-original plot device in this genre for a change!  I hope its good! <3 xoxo
Samara got tired of living in a well.
Girl wdf open your dam eyes 😂 after the dude didn’t respond after she said Marco like 12x should’ve OBVIOUSLY been a sign that something’s wrong dum ahh yt girl
well...this looks shit
Good movie
This movie is giving me all the nostalgia vibes. I was a 90s kid and grew up watching Are You Afraid of the Dark. There’s an episode  called Dead Man’s Float and it scared the hell out of me. It was about a monster living inside of a pool. I was terrified to swim at night in our pool after watching that episode. I’m really excited to watch this!
أعجبني ❤❤
It’s not a trailer it’s a teaser❤❤
No way they made a movie about this
It reminds me of that dye fantasy music clip. I wonder if its going to be about the pool being some kind of portal for lovecraftian horrors or just some haunting.
Wow n'est move
Super
This reminds me of that one episode of “are you afraid of the dark”. So glad to see my childhood nightmares being reimagined
1:41  Marco…… 😣   1:44  Polo! 😈
I want to see this movie.
Nice
Blumhouse movies feel so cheap and lame
at least batman knew how to play. what a good sport.
Does anybody get the feeling that this movie will be painful for them to watch?
The revenge of Sims who had their ladders removed in pools.
Dumbest looking movie ever.
The expanded title is “Bitch! You’re not honor bound to play “Marco Polo” in perpetuity! Open your eyes and swim in any horizontal direction and you’ll get out of the pool” they shortened it to “Night Swim” Seriously I get all horror movies are based on poor decision making, but it seems like the tension builder here is this girls “trapped” in a pool when she clearly is replete with opportunities to leave and willfully, chooses to remain in the scary place.
This looks like it could be very good, but the 1:40 moment where they say Marco Polo is one of the most unintentionally funny moments I've seen in a trailer. Otherwise, looks great.
A more than wonderful movie worth watching 👍🏻❤
"fuck you its January" - RLM
1:43 When you go night swimming in Gotham city
The most unrealistic part of this movie so far is that she kept her eyes closed after not getting a response after 2 marcos
I can’t wait until January 5th! I’m doing a review at AMC Theaters!
اعجبني
That was a bit underwhelming tbh
جميل
That voice though ....😏😏
I wanna watch it on January after December
Hollywood has truly run out of ideas…wow this is pathetic
Hollywood has truly run out of ideas…wow this is pathetic
Leaving someone isn’t how you play Marco Polo!!!
😍 A very wonderful movie. I am looking forward to it with joy
❤❤❤😅😅😅😅
I thought it would be some creepy mermaid movie
So stupid. Something happening to my husband. He goes crazy tries to kill everyone. How many movies has this been used in. That being said swimming pool idea scary.
ممتاز
Literally thought this was a commercial for Real Estate for the first 3rd of this trailer
Nice
Good 👍
When I saw James Wan, I knew I wanted to watch this😎.
I laughed when the monster actually replied “POLO!” 😂
Wow
اهلا رائع هل من مزيد
Just don’t go in the pool?
will NEVER swim at night again!!!!!!!!!!!
Why the hell was this stupid movie sworn to me as a ad even though I don't like horror movies at all and I don't watch horror movies what so ever and the bit with the cat getting dragged and drowned from what I assume as this is a frickin horror and the poor animals are always going to be the innocent victims in these stupid horror movie!!! This is why I don't watch horror movies what so ever!!! I'm someone who has a ton of empathy towards animals and especially cats as I grew up with them as pets and see them get supposedly drowned in a crappy horror movie give me anxiety and now I won't be able to have a good night sleep because of this shitty horror movie!!!! I know all the deaths in the movie are fake and the cat didn't really die but me simply seeing it and with how my empathy is seeing the cat supposedly drown is emotionally still going to get to me even though as I said before it is fake. I hate having anxiety!! To help me feel better I'm going to hope that the cat survived the encounter and the collar that the cat was wearing was a breakaway and the collar broke away and the cat was able to flee from the monster!! I'm also perfectly fine with people who enjoy horror movies getting upset with my opinion with this movie as it is just a opinion and mostly will not affect the enjoyment of the movie all that angry about Youtube showing the ad for this horror movie when I don't watch horror movies especially ones with cats supposedly die in it.
This is gonna b trash
well ok
Reminds me of an episode of Are You Afraid Of The Dark, involving a Swimming Pool.
.aaaand that ladies and gentlemen is how you make a trailer. short, sweet and only gives you enough to actually want to the movie itself.
Looks like a cool movie. Just wish they didn’t show all the scares in the trailer
I dont like there is a cat cause in these movie they always kill the animals
So as long as they stay out of the pool, they’re fine. Got it. 🙄
So "it" shows up 10 seconds after the guy leaves? wtf?
I bet it ends with them filling in the swimming pool and moving out of the house.
While the trailer does do a good job of giving me tone it does an awful job of giving me context. Like I don't understand what the horror part is supposed to be? Everyone knows if you're playing this game and people ditch you and you stop getting responses.... you open your eyes. Here we have a character who is just about at that "I'm not having fun anymore" stage but somehow still refusing to open their eyes.  Edit: Scratch that. I've seen this trailer 4 times and yet somehow double checking right after I typed that.. I see what looks like an extra scene like a mandela affect just slipped in there.  She opens her eyes, swims down and then back up and .... closes her eyes? It's still weir but it's not so weird I don't understand the reality of what's going on.
This seems mediocre, but I will still watch it.
This trailer was def better than Trailer 2. They should've just stuck with this one until the movie dropped.
it's prob a chiknhead from harlem in the pool
Crap
I mean lets be real, who isn’t terrified of swimming in the pool at night
1:44
I think there's a monster in the pool 👹💀🏊‍♂️🌊
Now, a haunted swimming pool. Next, a toilet with a poltergeist. NIGHT DUMP.
I wanna see this
yawn
Always feared a shark in there for no reason at night lol
I like it. Reminds me of the Good Ol 2000s horror movies that made no real sense LOOKING AT YOU JOY RIDE AND I LOVE YOU FOR IT
can that idiot just open her eyes widely and see what is happening around her???
Seriously??? How long does a person sit in a pool with their eyes closed at night repeating "Marco" over and over when they don't get an answer? Looks dumb.
Hopefully it’s refreshing like it promises. Something new and not a reboot or a 10th sequel
This is a Netflix movie at best. Who is going to see this at the cinema.
HELP THE POLO MADE ME SHIT MYSELF
I like how she was clearly peaking and cheating in Marco Polo but refused to just open her eyes and admit defeat haha.
I'm I the only one who thinks the pool looks awesomely big?
Não façam isso com quem tem medo de água, porfas!
It is just me or does this remind anyone of that Courage the Cowardly Dog Episode Queen of the Black Puddle? The monster pulls Eustache into the seemingly tiny puddle which is actually like an ocean under there with an underwater lair
At least it's not a midnight swim
Looks good
I'd be out after the 2nd Marco. Ain't nobody got time for that 🤨
Leave the cat alone!
Bro the boy that was swimming with her was literally my neighbor years ago❤😂
P 😊c m
Snake skin spirit, take this spirit out of this pool!
is that a parody movie? because that thing looks really dumb
After third time of saying Marco and getting no response open your damn eyes 😳. I would have opened my eyes see that pool is dark and got the hell out.
meh. i like to swim alone in my chateau in southern france. only in my saint laurent thongs cuz why dafuq not. i aint scared cuz i aint a bish
Perhaps im just a jaded old man but this looks awful.  Talk about cookie cutter.  And James Wan's credit is The Nun?  Dear god man, you can do better than that.
Huh? Wouldn't see it based on this.
Please don’t let the cat die by drowning or something else
Crazyness.
This shit looks ass lmao
Am I the only one who thinks this trailer looks pretty crap? The girl seems like an idiot
"the spooky pool"
It really should've said from Blumhouse and James wan the producers of the insidious franchise and m3gan.
I hope nothing happens to the cat
this looks....not great.
Blumhouse is such a fucking cheapskate
I was expecting this was gonna be a remake of the Creature from the Black Lagoon.
I just wanna say I'm hyped for Wyatt Russell! I'm gonna see the movie, just to see him.
100% crap and more. I'll pass.
oh she was good and stupid...
1:50 NIGHT SWIM  RATED PG-13 COMING SOON
So it's gonna be a movie about a demon that haunts the swimming pool?
LAME!
A other stupid American movie...
cat
homegirl took a little too long to open her eyes after the 10th time saying "marco" and hearing nothing back, sees a strange figure in the pool that is not her boyfriend AND DIVES IN TO CHECK ON IT? wtf this is the kind of stuff that pisses me off about horror movies, people have no survival skills whatsoever, my god  with that being said: i'll be watching, thanks <3
looka like stranger things season 1 swimming pool scene
Damn, Never thought that this movie would be about swimming during the night.
Looks promising. Nice trailer
This looks pretty good, I'll definitely catch this one when it releases.
From James Wan -- master of cheap, shitty, cliche-ridden, cookie-cutter, paint-by-number, lame ass pseudo horror failures. "Night Swim", really? This is truly the bottom of the dumpster.
This looks stupid af
Марко, поло
Que bosta
wow waytt russell
One the few trailers that doesn't give the entire movie away. 👍
Girl - Ronan  you are dead  Ronan - reverse uno card☠️
This tailer is sinking in.
this look gooood
I was hoping it would be more realistic, like an Alligator showing up during their game and them facing off against it for an hour, maybe its injured so cant get to them unless they try getting out.
how did they make Thalassaphobia not scary
Who's Under The Water? 😱😱😱
Excuse me, but how is a movie about a swimming actually scary? Like, this looks terrific.
Great. A movie from a horror master about one of most irrational fears. Awesome. Awesome.
The cat better not die
What ate her leg???
Wasn't this an episode of American Dad with a hot tub instead of a pool😂😂😂
It's just too much chlorine.😉😄. lol
And again a human female with a monkey.. What is Hollywood trying to say with that affront? Monkeys need love? Another movie to avoid.
How can they visually communicate the terror of hitting a warm patch?
She really takes Marco Polo seriously.  Ronin leaving … he’s kind of a jerk.
Please don’t kill the cat. Please don’t kill the cat. Please don’t kill the cat. Please don’t kill the cat. Please don’t kill the cat.
This reminds me of that girl (I think her name was Barbara) who got dragged into the pool in Stranger Things.
She’s still playing Marco Polo to this day.
This looks super horrible. And that is not a compliment. Same plot over and over.  So creative. Not.
Sounds like a flop
So excited for this one. Can’t wait!
See now, people, this is what happens when you don't put enough chlorine in your pool!
Fnaf movie trailer 2.0?
should have been a nude swim
This looks boring and unimaginative.
The best Marco Polo is between Drake and Chloe in Uncharted 2, and then when you win a Marco Solo trophy in Uncharted 3.
Really?
Our friends had a black lagoon pool back in the late 70's and they would put in a red light at nighttime and I would not be able to swim in it when that light was on.  They even had a phone that rang sounding like a bird that plugged into a queen palm.  It was on Squaw Peak Mountain in Arizona back when it was called that.
UMMMM JUST STAY OUT THE POOL PROBLEM SOLVED END OF MOVIE 🤦🏾😂
you know its going to be good when you have a black girl talking to the screen before it even comes out in theaters 😂
Why the hell does she keep playing and not just open her eyes?
I feel like all these movies start off with unsuspecting suburban family moving into murder home! 🤣🤣
I saw this trailer while going to see Terrifier 2 and I loved the suspense value in this. Looks very intriguing.
These days I separate horror movies into those that have jump scares and those that don't. Skilful filmmakers can build tension through a good story and well-developed characters. They don't need to deploy cheap tricks to induce stress.
looks dumb af i pass
Nope.
More cheap jump scares about swimming in a pool.  Cmon Hollywood, do better.
Are you afraid of the dark - the tale of dead man’s float did it first. Blumhouse is ripping off Nickelodeon kid horror shows at this point…and I am ALL FOR IT…
Girl just open ur eyes...its not that serious...
Im excited cuz this is James Wan and I love him. But I wonder like how much story there is here. I mean a haunted pool? Do you get cursed if you swim in it? Can they get you outside the water? I’m very curious
There can't be much to this story. First thing happens, then you never get back in the pool. End of.
This is gonna make me hate swiming more 😭
What was this thing at 1:47 ? Looked like a snake or croc or some kind of reptile
It's Blumhouse, but if Universal put their name on it, I'll give it a go.
It's gonna be a stretch...... good luck.......trailer bad.
Please God don't hurt the animal in this movie!
I can't close my eyes
Ladies and gentlemen, evil pool the movie!
When is it releasing again?
I can't wait for the sequel to come out: The Jacuzzi
How are they gonna make this into a whole movie though like what
Can’t wait
Let me guess, there was a tragic incident in that pool with the previous owners.
Holy dumb
The sequel is already planned for this horror movie. It’s called “Bathtub soaking in Hell”
This is what happens when professional writers go on strike. You get a horror movie about a goddamn swimming pool.
Diss movie its okej 😅👍
• Thalassophobia? Check  • Anxiety? Check  • Still wanna watch? Double check
Blumhouse films are such a guilty pleasure.
You think thats scary, wait til they get their heating bill
Falta só ter as piranhas na piscina
Boring
NOPE 🫣
Demo killing another Barb again.
I would be surprised if this didn't suck.
The first problem is, WHAT MAN LETS A WOMAN DRIVE THE CAR?
MPAA was supposed to earn the film an R rating, but MPAA decided to earn the film a PG-13 rating for violent content, terror and language
This looks like the type of movie a character in a cartoon would watch
I know there will probably be a twist in the movie, but just don’t go in the pool or swim at night.
hollywood writers at it again with the shittiest movies

this looks like a joke movie trailer that would be on an episode of SNL
Me yelling "fishy!!!" at the screen.
That "Marco Polo" doesn't make any sense to foreiners. What the hell does that mean and where does it come from?
Another stupid jump scare fest. Also, James Wan didn’t direct this so stop saying he did. He showed up to set one day and asked where the pizza was and left. That’s about it
Will this be one Netflix?
These movies really make white women look so naive 🙄 there isn’t a single white woman I know in real life that would have stayed in that fuckin pool after he didn’t answer the second time
What’s weird is I *absolutely* feel terrified when I’m swimming alone in an indoor pool…..
Those 2 directors... Dont miss their movies...
Finally a movie based off of my favorite are you afraid of the Dark segment "Tale of the Dead Mans Float"
I dunno..don't go in the pool?
Night Stupid
I saw this before the fnaf movie and let me tell you I was really frighten at this especially at 1:44
When you have a low budget...
😂😂😂😂😂 this looks too dumb
AW MY KIND OF MOVIE
Pffft, two unanswered Marcos and I’m done playing with yo’ cheating ass.
In a world of horror... one studio ...has run shit out of ideas...comes a descent into a new level of terror.  YOUR SWIMMING POOL!  What I just wrote is about as imaginative as this flick will be.
This one’s for the kids who were always told ‘it’s a pool there are no sharks here’
Тупасть американская😂
Just...stay out of the pool?
I think if I see this movie it will take a while for me to go swimming again…especially at night(which I never do anyways)
Night swim is coming to summer 2024
The way the monster says polo at the end got me laughing
I love the fact that they made a horror movie based on a swimming pool. I would definitely watch this
It's a flop. Much too predictable and cliche horror 👎🏻
The sound of your breathing in the pool is captured so well
Fun fact, I saw this trailer in theater and around that time, in the back of my mind, or some sixth sense before the logos show up, I was thinking “who’s gonna die first”
This looks so good! Great concept!
Lmao I saw this trailer before the fnaf movie started this was hilarious
It’s about damn time you said polo what took his ass, so so long
Oh Blumhouse - how I love your movies
This must be one of the dumbest if not the dumbest storyline for a movie I have ever seen.
Backroom vibes
Well this movie looks terrible 😆
this looks bad.
Ah shit, it's Poolthulu!
No
How could anybody think that this looks scary??
You can feel Wan’s touch here with the choice in shots and built of anticipation in what terrifying thing will happen, he’s truly a master at horror🙌🏻
This looks like something that will be laugh out loud silly... Looks dumber than the new exorcist.
1:44
What was that thing on her neck at 0:43?
Why don’t u just f~ing open ur eyes? 😂😂😂 so silly
Was that supposed to be scary😂 really Marco Polo? 😂
cant wait for 2 hours, pool scene
A film about an evil swimming pool. Great. Fantastic.
My deepest fear.. dark water
Blumhouse is ruining horror smh
Saw this before the fnaf movie, it immidiately caught my eye, and even got genuinely scared when the monster said "POLO"
W końcu znalazłem ten który będzie w listopadzie
How does it go from shallow to like really deep so suddenly?
When I was a kid, I had a serious fear from pools, especially from that little black holes for water filtering on the bottom of the pools. Now, as an adult, I could relive my childhood trauma, lol XD
I guess if a movie based on a killer tire exists, anything is possible.
No
This movie is just trash by the looks of it
1. A normal person would have opened their eyes, seen that they were alone and then gotten OUT of the pool. 2. Ronan is an a**hole. Stupid trailer.
GIRL LEAVES THE POOL AND END OF THE MOVIE... CREDITS!!! ... ANOTHER ENDING... FAMILY EMPTY THE POOL. THE END!!!
Hmm, the way she was pulled into the pool. Reminds me of Nightmare on Elm Street a little.
Will this movie be Rated PG-13 or Rated R?
Marco
Come on guys, the point goes to why Marco left suddenly, who cares about the pool and the night
They literally showed the full film
Did James Wan so dirty with that one. Of all the movies you could mention, they chose The Nun, lmao.
When me and a friend saw this trailer in a theater, the moment the girl gets dragged, she turns to me and goes “The Gongoozler”. I have never stifled a laughing fit quicker in my life.
I really wanted to hear the voice of scream say polo !
I have a bad feeling about this movie. Like a bad feeling that this movie might not be that good. Feeling I would rather watch Thanksgiving then this.
i’ve swam at night alone i never saw anything bad about it
Marco? POLO
I went to the movies today see five nights at Freddy's and this was one of the films that popped this looks like it will be I'm going to see this movie
i’m hyped
Whole time I’m like girl just get out the Mf pool 🙄
New fear unlock.
This is just Dead Mans Float turned into a feature length movie instead of just an episode.
Yeah this looks dumb AF
Wait this is just the trailer? I straight up thought it was a mini film before watching the Fnaf movie. How on earth can you stretch this to be a feature length film?
am I the only person who just got incredibly annoyed that she kept her eyes closed after he stopped responding? like the horror movie logic just ruined it
Looks dumb and ridiculous. Gonna be a great popcorn flick!
Blumhouse is great studio
I can't comprehend people thinking this is scary when she could have opened her eyes at any time during that 90 second stretch of itme.
Wow!  That looks incredibly bad.
Honestly, I'll watch ANY James Wan movie there is. The man does a ton of a lot for our horror genre when A LOT of movie-makers have their thumbs up their asses. Keep it up Mr. Wan. We're thankful for ya!
So a demon haunts the pool?
Who keeps their eyes closed for that long in a game of Marco Polo lmaooooooooo she’s so dam dedicated, that monster had time to switch the lights on and off, kill the other dude, change the water temperature, make a sandwich, pay property taxes….
My son wants you to make   Garden OF BANBAN movie
I will never understand white people and their antics.
The part where the ??? says "POLO" made me laugh. I don't think that's as scary as the filmmakers hoped it would be.
NGL, this trailer makes me laugh my ass off.  "Marco?" "P̵͔̰͚̠̫̙̯̽̆̒͆͝ͅO̴͔̪͒͐͐̊̈́̑̚Ĺ̵͖͑̈́̈Ṍ̵͇̔̕"
What rating will this be to you guys?  *R* or *PG-13?*
Why did Ronin leave the pool? Was he going to Pizza Hut?
Maybe he could make horror about sharks.
This is it. Can never buy a house with a pool ever again!
“POLO”
is that the same cat from the short?
No more plots. All plots used up
Where is this?
But why was she even calling his name for a long time she could've opened her eyes and went inside ? 😅
0:50 1:29 1:46
So, don’t swim at night and you won’t be killed.
Марко - придурок, бросил девушку одну в бассейне. 😠Надеюсь снимут вторую часть фильма, где с Марко так же поступят.😏
James Wan never disappoints.
So you just don’t go swimming and ur good? Or lol
Why is the pool so deep
Holy jeez that voice scared the crap outta me😭
She opened her eyes and noticed nobody was in the pool. Get out!! 🤦🏾
Finally a blumhouse movie
This is the movie of all time.
this movie reminds me of lady in the water
Hated the step person me dad bred with it..taught it how to bath...never came out the shower
Is it Ben Kingsley from Sexy Beast.  I'm sure Ray Winstone buried him under the pool
okay.....😂 im sssory😅 that was hilarious😂
I feel like it will be terrible… like just get out of the pool???
Are her eyes glued shut?🙄
Who would keep their eyes shut for that long playing by themselves? Cheesy demon voice, inconsistent pool depth, stereotypical horror victim failing to notice obvious blinking lights or the fact that she’s alone.I’m going to pass on this, looks like it was written by a 12 year old. Great lighting and sound though.
This was an ok short film
It hope it’s scarier then a crab thingy in the pool
This feels like a movie made by people who ran out of ideas... Seriously a horror movie about Marco Polo in a pool?
Who else got scared when he said POLO 👇
I want a new version of Jurassic world but it's based off of the book Book series
Interesting ✌️
glass shark. glass shark gonna get ya
The pool scene made no sense, at all, like wtf
Man that's dumb. No reason at all for the girl to keep closing her eyes. I know horror movie characters are supposed to be dumb, but this is just a new low. No wonder they put "producer of the nun" as their selling points, this movie must be aimed towards those dumb people who like the nun
Demonic Jaws at home. 🎉
I see all movie in this trailer😅
So like where did the other digit go? Like daduq?
When are you Woody THE Woodpecker 2 😅?
The absolute scariest part of this film, will be the pool cleaner presenting his service charge to the parents...
Blumhouse are the GOAT of the horror movies
Umm maybe just don't go in the pool after that? End of movie.
Is it me or brownish-tinted movies always suck?
Nun in the pool - coming to cinemas near you 😂
Ahh man cant we get a horror where the people do everything right and STILL get killed. Its so much more immersive and scarier.
For WHEN in theaters?
girl took the game too seriously and where did that boy even go?
Just like ummm...leave the pool?
There’s gonna have to be a lot more to this than just a monster in a pool for this movie to last its 1 hour and 56 minutes.
im hoping its like that one episode of KND when numbah 4 went into the pool and came out in like a alternate/reversed dimension
My wife asked if I wanted to have a romantic swim in our pool at night.   I said hell no. Something about dark water and dark surroundings. If I can’t see my bits in water forget it.
So he disappeared, she eventually opened her eyes and seen he wasn't there and continued to stay and play even though she knew he was gone................. this is soo f'n stupid 😂
Im only saying "marco" one time. you have  3 seconds to say Polo or my eyes are open and i'm out the pool
😴
Suspension of disbelief is obviously needed 😢
Nice film, a bit short though
a demogorgon just wants to play
Why would you make your trailer about a girl being the dumbest and most ignorantperson ever ? So unrealistic any person would’ve opened their eyes after not hearing a response for that long and realize he was gone. But no… she dives in the water like he would actually be down there for that long….
Release date ????
I see James Wan i know its going down
Meh, swing and a miss, methinks.
that voice 🥰🥰
Straight to streaming kind of movie
girl it’s not that serious you don’t have to close your eyes that long 😭
*whispers* LADY IN THE WATER
After seen producer of The Nun my hype level is below 0.
I'm going to be honest, I thought this was a real estate commercial at first.

Night Swim: The Jerry Falwell Jr. Pool Boy Story
I remember playing Marco Polo as a kid 🥶
i saw a short movie like this and now there will be a MOVIE
They really gonna drag out this story for 90 minutes?  Seems like it should be 10 mins.
When will blumhouse learn not to reply too much on cheap jumpscares 😮‍💨
FINALLY A FILM ABOUT A BELOVED CHILD HOOD GAME.. THE ONE AN ONLY WORLD OVER MARCO POLO SKIRTS AND COLOGNE. I LOVE THE SMELL AND THE SNUG FIT.. BUT NAW.. COOL MOVIE CONCEPT.. CAN'T WAIT TO SEE NIGHT SWIM 2, 3 AND NIGHT SWIM HALLOWEEN PARTY NIGHT: A CREEPER (JEEPERS CREEPER) INVITATION "IF THE POOL DOESN'T TAKE YOU OUT THE CREEPER WILL SWOOP DOWN AND TAKE YOU TO ITS' NEST OF THE MOST AFRAID VICTIMS... AS THE CREEPER ONLY GOES FOR THE MOST FRAIDY CATS OF THE BUNCH.
Well that looks shit
Can't wait to see thiss
After opening her eyes and swimming down saying ronan your dead, noone in the pool... why would you swim back up and carry on playing?
Good lord, where did all the good horror movies go?????????
Looks garbage
Another Long feature based on a short film done by someone else
Producer of The Nun. Not sure if I ever want to see that
i love how the start of this trailer is the same as the fnaf trailer
Trailer doesn't explain a damn thing in the slightest. Zero interest in this so far.
Another shark movie 😂😂
Ohhh snap
That is why i swim at 0630h with lifeguards, so the ghosts can never get to me. Muahahaha!
Why don’t she just open her eyes 🤦🏿‍♂️ yea I’ll pass on this stupid ass movie
Looks like it could’ve just been a short film. I know this is a waste
Just fucking open your eyes and don’t wait for a whole minute cause at that point he is js fucking with u so I would fuck with him back
Was this supposed to be scary
Indian Burial Ground under the pool?  Like in Poltergeist lol
That trailer gave me the creepy crawlies...
Yawn.
So 2hours film in a pool.  No thanks. Boring😢
swimming pool monster movie, interesting
No normal person would keep going after 2 failed attempts and that too in night at newly shifted house I mean come on get out lol
POLOOOOOOO....!  There I said it. Oh my goodness. Can't stand her whining.
Finally a movie where that dumb girl didn't have sense enough to get out of the pool, and just sat there waiting for something terrible to happen.
It’s from James Wan and Blumhouse. What more can we ask for??
Reminds me of the Are you Afraid of the Dark episode 'the tale of the dead mans float' where there is a corpse ghost pulling people underwater and killing them.
Just get out of the pool 🤷🤔
- Marco
So the guy just left her?
Not appealing at all more of a forced plot . Why will you not open your eyes.
Now I want to see a movie adaptation of The Tale of the Dead Man's Float.
Damn! I used to hate when during gun play I had to tell the other kids, "You need to die when you get shot!"
looks boring as hell
Talking about being committed to the Marco Polo game! Never opening your eyes 👀??!!! Really?? 🙈
Wtf 😂😂😂
what is the fear of water called? like deep dark bodies of w ater because i have that and i dont think it is a very good idea for me to watch this but i dont care because it looks scary
This looks dreadful
https://youtu.be/px3ACrGIhuY?si=V2O99WvcSOLUJgsu
Ill be disappointed if I dont hear Night Swimming by R.E.M
LOL
Nope.
Yep, I love horror movies where a family moves into a new house; associated with teens; and creatures.
Wow, that is a nice pool.
So a family with kids shouldn’t buy an affordable house that nobody wants …got it 😂
Bride of Mike Ermhantraut :)
👍
Maybe the pool was an Indian burial ground  .
Is she blind?  I notice she never really open her eyes
I love the idea of an endless pool and maybe she has to get out of it but she gets lost and the monster is also a problem so yeah
Written flop all over it.
the most terrifying scene of this trailer is when they decided to use pH pool stripes. scared the SHIT out of me.
https://youtu.be/h2GHeatkPPU?si=AGJ5BZh25p1SSOaC😊
nice
As a competitive swimmer I find this terrifying
Good
Damn, that's deep. I have a fobia for deep pools, I'm skipping this one.
Super i like❤❤
Spongebob?!
I don't know which word is the most appropriate dumb or useless
Nice one ❤
Amazing
Terrible.  Just terrible
There goes my swimming pool membership
Good
I already think of Bruce the shark from jaws when I swim, I guess swimming pools are about to be permanently ruined for me
nice movies
ronin took the fattest shit
That’s not a pool that’s a whole ocean
You know, i had been used to say marco polo when i did went to a camp let's us swim then an activity we said marco polo on a pool.
I wrote a screenplay about a haunted hot tub, but it didn’t go over very well. I guess because it was only a three-person tub.
That guy is a HUGE jerk for just leaving the pool like that 😂
If Marco leavess the chat so am I
I identify as furry/rawr/furry
James Wan novo mestre do terror (fundador da Atomic Monster) e Jason Blum (fundador da Blum House) se juntam novamente pra produzir esse filme (Night Swin) que tem previsão de estreia para janeiro de 24. Ansioso por este filme apesar da outra parceria entre eles não ter dado certo, que foi no filme Megan (minha opinião). Seria melhor se James Wan fosse o diretor, mas mesmo assim acho que vai ser um bom filme.
Okay, new fear unlocked: Thalassophobia
She's white what do you expect?  How stupid is she for NOT opening her eyes n getting out of the dam pool !
This looks terrible respectfully
I want a lot of bikini scene  !!!!
seeing james wan as the producer you know this is going to be a banger
the best one
film made with 50$ that worths 5$....
Sampai saat ini, saya masih takut berenang di kolam renang🏊👹
from the first unanswered "marco" I woulda dip for sure
Bull shit story
LAMMMEEEEEEEE
This is very similar to a fantastic short film called “Deep End”
open.your.eyes.
What a stupid, cliche horror movie. Family moves into a nice house, children complain about it (for some reason), teen daughter has boy over for Marco Polo, boy leaves apropos of nothing, daughter drags out the game unto incredulity of the audience, giving monster its belated "jumpscare", and it all plays out predictably, making the extensive game of Marco Polo even stupider. It seems like a parody, but the actress did not realize it.
Is it a shark ?
This looks very good and very creepy
good
Sangat penasaran dg film ini 🇮🇩
Real horror movies coming back ? Omg
Damn this is so cliche'd
this is how Barbara disappeared in the first season of Stranger Things
as if she's going to continue to keep her eyes closed (at night in a pool) and say "Marco" repeatedly when no one has answered for over a minute
I think I saw something like this over on Alter or CryptTv
No one literally:  The Pool: POLO!
is she blind?
Spooky but still not enough to scare me away from night swims.
And last/then his boyfriend/friend where the one doing a non funny joke... on a night swim day
........  Dont get in the pool? .......
Please upload the full movie night swim that you soon as possible
It always starts with moving into a new house
Good
I like swimming and horror movie.I see the horror movie.
universal buy wb
Very good movie
F*** Marco polo I ain't watching it....new fear unlocked
Grate video
Amazing 😍 i love this trailer ❤
she played marco polo that long? i wouldve peeked or left the pool after 30 seconds of no answer
From producer The Nun and M3GAN love it❤️❤️❤️❤️
Could’ve just left the pools alone. Now I’m piss scared on entering my own damn pool !🙄🤦🏽‍♂️😖🤪
hommage to jaws?
Eek that drain 😮 FINALLY a movie that will scare us pool phobics #submechanophobia
Like the trailer very much
Say what you will about murderous, malevolent forces but at least they abide by the rules of "Marco Polo".
Cannot wait to see this😢😢
Is it scary because every American household has a swimming pool?
Good
Plz realise date
Great movie love it
I already don’t have a wierd fear of an empty pool thanks universal for making it worse
Typical derivative james wann garbage
This is why I hate swimming
Pool Ghost????
So Good
So what she does immediately
Oh wow this was recent, I thought this was like 3 years ago
We know who Blumhouse is, don't need to tell us they produced M3gan....weird
If ony they made a horror movie called the bloop the giant sea monster fish 🐟 or submechanophobia with sea monsters animatronics in the ocean coming out of the deeps
Rich white folk problems and fear.
Looks dumb, haunted swimming pool? Guess my swim suit is also haunted huh
Now thats a trailer.
Savitar from Flash out for a swim
i knew it!!
Time to get out of the bath. 😳
This is how a trailer is supposed to be.
This looks more like a mix between a PSA and a short film
People will actually not going to swim at night after watching this and if swimming pool was built around forest area then it will be terrifying af
Coming soon the rapture, be ready. If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Ephesians 2:8 Jesus died on the cross for you, repent and believe.
The entire movie is about swimming in a pool at night calling out Marco Polo is what I get from this trailer.  Not exactly a mind melting idea.
I’m here!
That girl dumb.
Kerry Condon ❤❤❤❤
1:44
That's a nice pool though
booorring
agreed. Best 2 days of owning a pool was the day i got one put in the ground and 20years later the day took it out of the ground and filled that fucking hole in.
PERFECT. Didn't show too much, Just showed enough. Excited :)
Night Swim | Official Trailer Distributed By; Universal Pictures Production Companies: Blumhouse Productions and Atomic Monster Licensed to: Nintendo Studios
Trashhhh
Must miss.
James wan is good I can't wait to see this in a pool but I hope its not a ghost and more a monster some sort I was hop8ng to see like a serpent like some alien thriller 5type movie
I swear being in a pool by myself creeps me out always think gonna be like a shark or soemthing behind me in ocean alone is creepy I can't wait for this
Can't she see without glasses? Is that what's happening?
Film: get scared  me: of what Film:: Clears throat........"Evil Swimming Pool" Me: Uh.........
❤
Good
So scary movie 😂😂😂
Nyc
Is this the full movie of short horror movie called DEEP END?
The pool feels like a legit scp anomaly.
Does no one know the official date
just makes me scared to swim more :(
❤❤❤❤ great job BJ!
The idea is creative. I will give James wan that
So nice and good... Wow
More jumps are straight to DVD garbage most horrors are shit and not even scary.
Now that’s how you make..a fucking..trailer. 👏🏾🍿
Wtf isbshe still playing, dude obviously gone🤦🏿‍♂️🤣🤣🤣
Watching👀 this movie🍿🎥 trailer make me remember house of my mom, mamih. Graha Family H-29. Graha Family H-29 is old home. Old house! Because, that's house is sold out. In there having swimming🏊 pool and then I ever swim alone suddenly, someone else swim together with me. And when I saw who is that, she/he is gone! Very creepy, so creepy. I'm so scared😱😰🙀. In another day, I'm swimming again and then I see👀 feet👣 running🏃💨💨 at around of pool. I think that's ghost👻. Menurutku, itu hantu👻 deh!.
She committed to that game
This looks stupid
Whenever i see blumhouse i get excited
Good
Really??  Nooooooooooooooo
After like 3 tries I would’ve been done!🤣🤣🤷🏽‍♀️💯 I said “polo.” In my evil voice right before the real evil voice did.🤣🤣🫣 cause that’s how it’s done 😌✅
”It was just a prank”
The monster sounds like Batman😂
For once, I want to see a horror movie where the character didn't make one dumb decisions after another and still got trapped, because there was nothing they could do to escape from the supernatural. Why is it so difficult to come up with that kind of story?
I may be wrong but the scene where that person gets out of the pool leaving the girl alone as a mischief is wrong because whenever someone leaves the pool it creates a lot of noise as well as significant amount of displacement in water. So it's hard to leave the pool that conspicuously...
Just open your eyes already 😑
yeah, because someone would just keep playing the game by themselves like that.. rofl
Nice
Evil swims tonight!
this movie is going to make me not want a pool
I love this trailer 😍
Amazing trailer ❤❤
Wasn't there another movie with almost the same plot like being stuck in a pool 🙃🙃
It’s crazy, but some how we all feel same way about this feeling, i remember when i was in a trip in Mexico and we rent a house at the top of a mountain closed to a beach with ocean view, i was by myself in the big pool, all my friends were inside playing while i was just with light of the moon, while i inside the pool, i was imagine so many things that could be inside the pool with me, i had to get out because i got scared even tho it was only my imagination.
Its like they saw that one episode of courage the cowardly dog and was like "You know, lets make a movie about that!"  Not that I'm complaining, it sounds like a great concept for a movie!
Blumhouse eating good since last year wtf non stop cooking
another pool horror movie, I think Tubi has like 4 at the moment
This looks so dumb, a haunted pool jesus christ
oh look another jump scare cringe movie made for idiots by James Wan
WHO IS KEEPING THEIR EYES CLOSED FOR THAT LONG???
Man i just hope the movie is as scary as the trailer movies now days are so whack and i love them alot my favorite genre is horror and comedy and so far horror has been terrible comedy is ehh i be wanting to contact these film directors and just ask them why
i hate it sm but i really wanna watch it
Nice
Great
its horror
LMAO that last "POLO" got me XD
So basically marco is a bokachoda
All i need to hear is Atomic Monster/James Wan is involved and I'm in... Only he can turn innocent Marco polo game into something scary so kids never swim again
good
good
I’ve always feared swimming at night in my swimming pool. I also remember playing Marco Polo with my brothers at night too ; terrified if they don’t answer back as a joke. I always thought some shark would eat me alive. I am so glad someone had this idea!
Esta pelicula va a ser un fracaso de taquilla
This kinda patience I need
🔥
1.35 What a lovely botty ❤
Movie for thalassophobia
Not bad. It Shall Not Be Named on tubi is way scarier though.
From the producer of 'The Nun'  Yea, this is gonna be ass
This is a carbon copy of the short film with the exact same concept 😭😭💀💀
The Thallasophobia is killing me.
Extremely stupid plot, seriously. Not believable characters at all.
OMG 😱 Why I know that was something under the pool 😳 In this moment I’m frightened 🙈 But, if Mr. Wan is the director, I know it would an amazing movie.
മനുഷ്യനെ പേടിപ്പിക്കാൻ ഓരോന്ന് എടുത്ത് വച്ചോളും 🥵
good
1:41 Marco 1:44 Polo That was creepy.
If it's like anything else Blumhouse has made, it'll be on a $30 budget and subsist entirely on cheap sound-based jumpscares that don't actually have any resolution/release.
I'm getting soooo tired of jump scares.  That's all this is going to be.
Is it just me or do the best horror films come from Blumhouse?
Blumhouse It's going to be good!!
That polo voice lmaooo
«From the producers of The Nun and Meghan.» Thanks for the yawn warning😃
😂😂😂😂booooring PC crap
In 2006 I was at de shores of Lake Toba in Indonesia at night. The dark waters illuminated by de moon were utterly terrifying to me. I would have never gone for a swim . It was kinda primal and I am afraid of no man.
why does the guy get out of the pool and leave? lol
scare? -_-
is that monster or ghost?
good
Ahh yes.. moving to a new house
hmm another shark in a swimming pool i guess?
1:46 BRO WUT IS THAT!?😳😳
I feel like we've always played around with the idea of scaring each other (or quietly sneaking out of the pool 😂) whilst playing Marco Polo and I'm so excited to see a movie carry that further
This looks like it is going to be horrible tbh lol
I cannot wait to forget this stupid idea
The is the same vibe when Barb from Stranger Things was in the pool 😢
Totally nothing so be called as a "Horror movie" 😂😂
The trailer was good but when it comes to the full movie I'm thinking that's not even good enough 🙄
Think of all the people who pee, cough and spit in swimming pools, plus all those exposed veruccae and warts etc. That's horror for you right there!
Why the hell didn't she open her eyes, she even closes them again after diving and coming back up.
Waiting for the 180 minute horror movie of somebody putting on his shoes.
Lority.......
I guess his name is Marco. It’s a guess.
Damn😭
Maybe get out of the pool…?
It's  a very beautiful video
Seems kinda short movie
Scenes in water are not always scary, sometimes it scarier when you come to the surface for breathing, that's where the terror begins.
Good boys 2 movie
Really!? Soon there is going to be a pool in my backyard and you tell me there is a horror movie of this 😰
Fast 11 part 2 on April 4th 2025 & fast 12 part 3 on May 24 2026
Ehhh, not really original 🤷
Looks like a good popcorn flick
Now who wants to play Marco Polo after watching this? Definitely not at night 🌉

How long is this gonna be like 5 minutes or maybe 10?
This reminds me of that courage the cowardly dog episode “Queen of the black puddle”.
My anxiety lol
Mmmm now I didn’t expect that creepy voice to say ‘polo’ at all! 😂
And we already know in advance that it will be rubbish
Wow, this looks different. Lol.
A haunted swimming pool? Ugh.  Recently watched a short about a young boy that snuck into a backyard pool, and is terrorized by some kinda creature, in the pool. That was intense.
you know its gon be good when it says “from JAMES WAN”
So dude just left her outside to not come back ?? And she stayed in the pool that long without noticing ?
The Gongoozler
I hope she doesn't die so she can break up with her BF for ditching her in the pool lmao
anyone know the song?
Haha. A horror for rich people. Can't wait for the sequel. Haunted Limousine.
What a waste of my time, bad trailer.
So is it only about swimming pool ?
it reminds me of a short horror movie on youtube
This reminds me of the horror short ‘deep end’ really awesome short.
Does anyone know the piano song at the start it really rings a bell 🤔
Could it be a shark.
Goofy ass monster,playing Marco Polo
Nice Scary
No thank you
wow this looks great
“Oh, look, there’s a pool!” Like the dad didn’t know that from the house listing. This movie looks incredibly tropey.
what's wrong with this michael?
Why do ghosts and demons always have to go after the middle class family or the single mom with the weird kid trying to start over?  Why not go after some corporate or governmental war mongers who deserve it?  They have bigger pools after all.
I hope she survive.. so it will be plot twist
It scared me  Nice trailer 👍
Very good  tailor
OH HELL NAW
Blum House  🖤
A movie of my chilhood fear, finally a movie that's actually scaring me
She survived.
Телка- 🔥 , вроде🤷‍♂️
Че за бредятина эта "Марко Поло"?! Какой идиот это придумал и в чем прикол??? 🤦‍♂️👀
At some point ya gotta stop playing, and just get the hell outta the pool!!
I couldn't get it anything. This is the real problem of Hollywood. Their dark fantasy and imagination is boaring and stressful for anyone.
LMFAOOOO😂😂😂 That voice sounds so familiar from another horror flick🤔
Why don’t you just show the whole movie in the trailer 😅
Marco?     MY NAMES NOT MARCO
This looks sooooooo good
I like horror movies ❤ but I get scared a lot  😨
Me that plays marco polo in the bathtub 🛀😐
Is there no fish outta water shytttt
Super
Oh my gosh this looks so stupid maybe it’s worth watching lol
Whenever Blumhouse is involved just know that movie finna be spectacular
Cringe ill pass
I saw, James Wan, I'm in! 🔥👏
Blumhouse used to be good. Lately they’ve been releasing garbage movies. As soon as I saw James Wan, I frowned.
Why did the hand that grabbed her looked like a crab? Is that Davy jones? 😂
Is this movie directed by M. Night Shamalan?
Looks like it's going to suck but I'm interested. Gunna watch anyways
Swimming is a daytime activity imho.  Aint no way 😮im swimming at night
Anyone remember the one animated pool video with the higher beings/monsters
How to fight the water monster: *DONT GO FOR A SWIM*
Are there any piranhas in the pool?
This reminds me of an “Are You Afraid of the Dark?” episode Tale of the Dead Man’s Float
“Barbarian” but in a backyard pool, not a basement..
caca
I hate James Wan. He has turned horror movies into absolute trash. Best horror movie in years was Talk To Me.  And he had nothing to do with it. Thank god. Or he would have managed to ruin it like everything he touches.  All of American horror movies have gone to crap. James Wan is just the worst of US. Even Blumhouse has gone rotten. They literally invest in 20 junk horror movies for ever one quality horror movie. Then again, most of Hollywood just pumps out the same old junk eternally because they never get our of their Hollywood bubble and look for fresh voices from fresh talent. It's the same old hack producing the same old garbage. Endlessly. You can bet this is James Wan's same old formulaic jump scares and that he will tuned this into another one of his endless remakes series. And I bet the monster is a creepy looking woman than moves all hurky jerky with twisted stiff joints. Wan has used the same old monster and its same old moves for 30 years now. He is void of creativity. Selling tickets doesn't make a good movie when people have nothing else to choose from. In fact half the American public votes for tRump. So, you know how stupid half the American public is. And I am sure it's the same half that loves James Wan films and thinks they are so amazing and scary. Look at the James Wan movie list. The only good movie he was part of was the first Saw. And he didn't even write it. And it was only good because it was original and the killer was in the room the entire time. Every one of his movies after that are crap for children at best. I may go see the new Salem's Lot only because he was one of the producers. I hope to god they did not let him ruin it and turn it into one of his pathetic yawns.
One to miss.
This looks so good tbh
She going to get slashed!! slip once she gets outside of the pool  film over
*drains pool* bye bye movie
I saw Blumhouse...immediately got my attention.
Another Wan, he going for the swim
Looks shite
Finally, a movie trailer that didn't spoil the entire movie.
This is probably one of the dumbest trailers I ever seen in my life. Why tf would she continue to keep one eye closed when she clearly has the other one open lol watch this movie end up being fire
The only thing scary about this pool is the fact that it all of a sudden gets deeper somehow. You can watch and she is literally touching the bottom then she dives in and it's all of a sudden super deep. Then she comes back up and clearly starts standing on the bottom again and is pulled under? Makes no sense.
Feels like Jurassic World 2015 trailer, didn't really spoil anything but the movie will be great.
Stupid
they really get you until the Blumhouse comes on screen
This reminds me of the youtube short: DEEP END. Looks like this was inspired from that short film
That was boring, long 2 minutes...
good trailer
Wanna watch James wan blumhouse combo awsome
this feels like it was written by AI.
This looks soooo scary! I can not wait to see this. Ohhh myyy. Lol. Did anyone else jump at freaking foot at the ending. Ik I did. So creepy!
When I see BLUMHOUSE in the trailer, I stop watching and start counting down the days until release.
Waiting for this movie ❤️❤️
Marco Marco Marco.  That all I hear
I would have opened my eyes after the first time he didn't answer. I mean, let's be honest, we all would have seen him getting out of the pool
Is the boyfriend the monster killer ?
She takes the game way too serious 😆
I already got goosebumpgs😮
Can't understand it yet if it's horror or thriller. Because when it comes to Blumhouse they aren't the same as the gud old days. I would vouch for A24 instead
Anything with James wan. I m game👏👏
That moment when they rip music from Season 1 Stranger things specifically “Eleven” created by Kyle Dixon and and Michael Stein 😡
IS IT A HORROR MOVIE OR THRILLER MOVIE 👀
The Wan and Blum combo never disappoints!!!
Yep…NOPE
girl open your eyes!!! like be fr
Literally my childhood nightmare
Reel State was here.
Im calling it now, this movie will be horseshit
Evil night :- https://youtu.be/FTDZ2aaAkZY?si=F2I-1Qob87iWtiDn
This looks so garbage that its painful 😂
Looks stupid.
This looks excellent.
Can’t believe they made a movie about the gongoozler
Bit get tf out the pool lol 😂
Ridiculous!!!😂
Im lowkey excited for this
水鬼掹腳
This trailer makes no sense but I can see that if there wanting to leave any plot out
Dumb 😮
A haunted pool movie? Okay.
Yay, more shovelware
Everyone wanna vote off i don't wanna see that movie?
Stupid
1:43 cant wait for the new batman movie !!
Bitch after you opened your eyes and saw won’t nobody in the pool why tf would keep saying Marco 😂

😂 ok I lost interest after the 7th time she said Marco and STILL hadn’t opened her eyes. Who on this planet has that kinda patience for a game 😂 maybe it’s just me   Also just found out this movie is 2 hrs and releasing in January 🫠 I hope it’s better than I’m imagining
Why is she still playing that game? 🤔
You know this about to suck if it’s a movie about a haunted pool 😂😂😂
This movie looks stupid
Pretty lame. I swear they don’t even try this days. A24 is better than this mainstream nonsense
You know you'd open your eyes if you didn't hear back within seconds. I hate it when they write characters to be completely stupid.
Bro I don’t get scare with horror movies but holy crap this shit had my heart racing. I have a fear of underwater, the ocean and being completely alone in a pool
Pool ghost? I was hoping for pool shark but I guess a ghost is ok, or maybe merman.
This was a short film that didn't need to be turned into a full length film, classic universal.
every child’s irrational fear
Blumhouse try not to make the most generic horror movies challenge (impossible)
Why we gotta wait till January 🥺😩
Welp I’ll never swim in a pool again
I imagine this is going to bomb. Why did she not open her eyes after saying polo about 15 times with no response 😂
It's Always The Female That Dies First In Water.
Freddy Krueger
This looked good until the fake demon voice said "polo" now I'm laughing 😂😂😂❤
This trailer is so stupid. Who would keep their eyes closed that long after the other person didn't say Polo back? 😂
Who stays with their eyes closed THAT LONG when no one is answering you back?
Very nice
Awesome horror movie I will on theatre for sure❤
James Wan can't do any wrong! 💯🐐
Swear to god there’s an SCP about this very thing.
“Look out for my new movie Rape Stove: The Stove that Rapes people. I’m very excited!” -Patton Oswalt
Hollywood is finished 😂😂
Seems about white 🤔
This looks so dumb😂
This is gonna be 😊
Very interesting
Kinda sad to see James Wan getting to the point in his career that hes doing "I need a pay check to pay off my house in the Hamptons" movies. I'll check this out just to see how mid it is.
Another movie trailer, which showed the entire movie in the trailer. Thank you for ruining the movie and not making me pay to go to theatres to watch it.
Oh come on how long would you realistically keep your eyes closed? You’d definitely be able to tell something is off. 😂
Uaaa
I guess its not a remake, Preboot, reboot, sequel, adaptation, found footage or the like. still a hard pass but some credit for not being a retread.
Marco let’s eat polo
Is this going to be similar to Barbarian and Malignant?
This is like the one scene in any horror movie involving a pool, except it's being expanded into an entire film. It'll be interesting to see how it turns into a 90+ min movie
Nah, bruh. Swim Night is terrible. I know this is a horror movie, but it's not that jumpscary film. The Five Nights at Freddy's movie is a jumpscary film. Five Nights at Freddy's movie always wins to fight against Swim Night.
I'm around for this 👏🏾👏🏾
My irrational fear of sharks in the swimming pool wouldn't let me swim after 5.😅
JAMES WANNN NEVER DISAPPOINTS!!!!!!
Theres no way this isn’t a parody wth
looks like a dumb fun horror movie.
This is gonna be 🔥  Can't wait !!! 😍
I mean, there is a massive loop hole here...  Just don't go into the pool after this.  Safe.
fuck the writers striking in hollywood.....i would've fired every one of them and this is just another piece of shit reason why
okay this is cool
はい！見る
The whole trailer is just a fucking jumpscare ...., love it!!
Blumhouse is going for old school horror. Activities people do normally and make then terrifying
i can see they're running out of ideas
gyatt
Moral: Marco Polo should be played in daylight.
Wtf is this 💀
I can’t wait to see what James wan does with a non conjuring🙏
What the hell, Marco?
Love the concept and the trailer… and then I realized this was a January film and knew it’s a throwaway shit cash grab and not something they feel genuinely confident about
47 metres down uncaged open water fall youve met your match
FFS why  do american horror always begins at buying a new house?? like wtf?
James wan 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hope the cat doesn't die...
Hot chick😂
I see the horror movie every week.
I love James Wan. He’s a true lover of horror. This is like a throwback to 80s horror when they had things like a demonic bed, a demonic car, and in this case, a demonic swimming pool!
Hollywood can find anything regular to scare you :D soon a bag of chips will come to scare you it seems
Teh house is build over a cemetery
We have a movie about a supernatural pool? :/
“From James Wan Producer of the Nun”  As if people are going to get excited for it knowing the Nun was a downright shit movie full of cheap jump scares 😂
Can't wait to see this.
Does anyone know the song that’s playing at the beginning?
Justice for Barb
There really running out of ideas…
A haunted swimming pool? Okay, as ludicrous as that may sound, I'll give this movie a chance.
Why do all American horror films start with a family moving into a new house?
Another disaster.....
This is an extremely thalassophobic movie
Nah think I’ll give it a miss
universal what are you dooooooooinnnnggggggg
Tell me why people still swimming in the pool that took out Barbra season 1 smh
Unbelievable 5 min calling just open your eyes already 😅
please make M3gan sequel ASAP🙏🏾🤩🤣
I can't take this trailer seriously. You get two chances to answer "Polo." After that, I'm opening my eyes (FULLY, not squinting like her) and getting out of the pool.
another reason to be afraid of swimming pool...
This is a 💩💩💩 movie 👈👍
What was that that dragging that girl down
Looks lame.. Hollywood is running out of ideas
Finally  we all Agreed Nicki Minaj is the Queen of Rap❤️ #pinkfriday2 Nov 17
Oh hell no!
This is why I don't swim at night. Lol
Soooo, she didn't think to get her ass out the pool when she dived down & wasn't met with a pool floor but instead a seemingly bottomless pit into the abyss??? white people 🙄
OK so I don’t get it is there supposed to be a shark in the water like a ghost shark or is it just like someone creeping in the water like from the creature in the Black Lagoon?
Algae monster
Excited for the upcoming sequel, the jacuzzi
Pool - The Movie
Why the hell does her BACKYARD pool look like the ocean. How deep is it..
Is this based on the short film about the kid that jumps in a pool and it is suddenly bottomless with a monster? That was only a few months ago, quick turnaround if so!
Why that nigga sound like Freddy Krueger 😂😂😂
Tapping into my childhood fears of the deep end, I see. Probably not pool sharks, though
I thought I was the only person that was hella paranoid in the swimming pool at night 😂😂😂
Fantastic
So was the ghost's head out or in the water cause broddy's voice shouldve been "polo" with bubble sounds. 😂
As a huge horror fan, I have to see this, but it's confusing. Idk if it's supernatural or an actual person involved 🤔
It’s Freddy
1:44
My question is, does anyone gone far away leave someone in the pool just like that?
Too scary
James wan nr one
What? Is that the whole trailer? Ok, I'm waiting for more. Another movie making us fear something that could be of everyday, I'm down for it... And it's James Wan
Blumhouse? Yea u fukin know that cat finna be killed
Idk yet.
My thalassophobia just kicked in, even tho the anxiety I got from watching this clip I'm still going to watch lol
Thank You GOD AMEN 🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏!!!!!
Funny rather scary -2/10
No. Swimming pools are the only bodies of water I'm not afraid of. You can't do this to me!
Ooh, a movie with a similar theme to the scariest episode of "Are You Afraid of the Dark?". That should be a good one.
So your telling me the guy set her up to die because he knew what was in that pool… story seems stupid
I love the shot at 1:48 of the light coming from the pool’s surface. It’s terrifying how far away it is. It reminds me of Get Out when he’s in the Sunken Place looking up at his body.
This better be rated "R"
I was on the swim team when I was 14. I even won gold for the butterfly. We had night swims,where we all spent the night. Parents would come into the area and we'd be under blankets making out. One time my girl had her first period in the middle of one. There was all nite skate to but that was open to everyone. It was also way more adult even when I was only that same years summer. So yeah the 90s were off the chain
These movies are just tax write offs at this point. No way people were serious writing or filming this
Jaws won’t be swimming in that water. 💦 🦈 ❌
1:40 Oh no it’s a Horror & Comedy Woody woodpecker what have you done?
1:07 Stranger Things Rip-off
This movie seems lame 😅
This seem like it will be a short 😂
Stupid movie
looks shit.
What kind of idiot guy goes into the house during a Marco Polo game and leaves his girlfriend outside  swimming alone late at night in the dark?!!!
The beginning kind looks like a movie about murdered children in animatronics
🔥🔥🔥 Definitely can’t wait to see this one!!! 🍿😎
AM taking dad to see this movie as to the reason why i have not clean the pool for a whole month
So Jaws made everybody scared of the ocean and now this movie supposed to make me scared of my pool lol
Hoping this will be better than the one about the haunted lamp.
🐶 💩
A JAMES WAN MOVIE❤
Nothing amazing about this
Thank you movie for validating my fear of swimming in pools alone.  At most I thought that I would go under water and see a gyardos but this seems way worst.
I LOOOVEEEE JAMES WAN but noting “The Nun” isn’t really a good thing
I've already seen The Tale of the Dead Man's Float.
Silly.
New fear unlocked
Dumb movie, guaranteed
This would be a better short film instead of a jumpscare heavy cash grab pile of shit from Blumhouse.
nice that the trailer didn't give away every scene from the movie
Horror movies only function if the characters are stupid.
This is dumb af, the fact that she didn’t open her dumbass eyes. 😭😭😭 be more realistic.
Swimming alone scares me
Looks like it has potential but I'd love to see a little more...!
This movie looks fun to watch! I thought i was the only one who thinks something is in the pool when Iam swimming! As a kid Are you afraid of the dark on Nickelodeon had an episode similar to this movie and that was a rap for me! 😂
That girl is dumb and patient moment he didn’t reply would have open my eyes guy is jerk leaving her there alone finally something new to horror will check this out I saw goosebumps episode about swimming pool this one loos more adult
More woke interracial forcing
Another movie with an interracial couple. Black guy white girl. Wtf is with every movie having an interracial couple. It’s rare and doesn’t reflect the real world
I love this trailer 😍
This looks dumb as hell. Def couldve done better with this cuz its a decent idea
Trailer very disaster 😂
She could have just opened her eyes since he wasn't responding.
Haunted swimming pools?? They really aren't even trying anymore are they
Zzzzzzzzzzz
It's giving Are You Afraid of the Dark vibes, the real ones know what episode I'm talking about :)
Ab koi raat ko swim nahi karega 😂😂 ek bar to yad ayegi hi ye movie  Very happy to see James Wan back in horror genre ❤ missed him after seeing nun 2 and conjuring 3😅
nobody is that dumb 😮
Lame
It was not trailer its like clip of video
I was waiting for somethung to drag her in. For me, that wait was a bit too long.
aku tidak sabar untuk menonton film ini
It's not that serious..just a Baby Ruth guys!
Nice
Hii
Soooo yet another Jaws knockoff
So the movie about sims characters without the pool ladder
My five-year-old said this is lame and not scary at all and Hollywood is running out of ideas
All i could think was THE GONGOOZLER!!!
Please telugu upload ❤
The pool was built on top of a cemetery
I'm getting big dye fantasy vibes from this
If this isn't as wild as Malignant I'll cry
Now this is what you call a trailer. Im tired of those trailers that showcase a clip of literally every scene of the movie.
Lol.. "Puoh" is not scary. Come on I even prefer "BOO!!!!"
The real horror is the race mixing
If this is done right and the film is effective enough, its should make everyone scared of pools just like Jaws made people scared of the ocean. They shouldn't blow this, cuz this is a first.
I can’t wait to see the cast of upcoming actors and actresses.
Finally something different instead of the same haunted house crap. I'm excited for this
Yup now I'm not taking a swim in my pool at night. Done.
Ahhhh hahahaha the polo was laughable….hahahaha…another dumb horror movie for the brainless idiots
Fish outta water he loses 😂😂😂
Wait, these seems awfully similar to that “Marco Polo” short film CryptTV made
A haunted swimming pool huh 🙄 seems like draining the pool would take care of the problem
Its that Goose Bumps episode all over again 🤦
This doesn't look like a good movie at all.
Damn, she's really committed to that game!
Gah damn she was committed to the game!
....not impressed. Just open ur eyes
Question: how do you make a movie without leaving your house? Answer: ...
Why did he get out of the pool 🤔
You know you are in TROUBLE when MARKO does not respond on your 3rd call... Open your eyes Lady
I swear if anything happens to the cat...
Happy Halloween 🎃👻
Where's The Trailer For Kung Fu Panda 4?
I thought itll be like that music video back in the day where they broke into the pool and monster killed everyone and the girl ended up escaping into the other world and dying. It traumatized my generation when it came out lol. Its DyE - Fantasy if anyones curious
What
So it's going to be one of those horrors with characters frustrating the viewer with their dumb decisions
So the pool os some sort of portal to another dimension to hell
Another scary movie shit with cliche and Bad Writing and cheap scare jumps
BlumHouse always make great horror films can’t wait to see this
Are You Afraid of the Dark? did this better 25 years ago and it didnt cost $20 million
She thought it was the ocean. It’s just a pool.
Is it out now
What's up with horror movies and middle class white people moving into haunted houses?
I seen this trailer when I went to see the new Exorcist and I was so mad cause I was like why don't she just open her eyes? It's unrealistic lol
JAMES DONT FUCK AROUND, GIVE US NEW CONJURING MOVIE!!!!
Looks dumb
This scene goes on for way too long it's just abit stupid. You would just open your eyes and get out the pool after he stopped replying....
Usually I have a good idea what the movie is gonna be about by the trailer, but this one 🧏🏾‍♀️
LMAOOO
What a fuckin joke.
I thought it was nightmare on elm street once I heard that voice
👎
The deadly swimming pool . . . 🙄🙄🙄
Who would keep their eyes closed that long, lol.  C-mon now.
Awful trailer
It looks interesting.
Interesting concept. Yet again we see someone do something stupid and then something horrible happen. Why dont people in horro movies ever learn!
Not naming this movie MARCO POLO must’ve been hard.
The scary part here is how long it took her to realise that her boyfriend ditched her in the pool and then immediately dives into the water after realising that she was left alone. I know people in horror movies are supposed to be dumber than actual people (to create situations of tension and whatnot) but this one takes the cake in recent years 😂
They put zero effort into the idea
I deff wanna see this
Drone shot to start the trailer - check .. Single notes on a piano - check .. Family driving with disinterested kids in back - check .. Could it get any more cliched ?? ...
Polo 👹
Just get out of the pool???
If I had a nickel for every time, Hollywood made a horror movie based around a pool I think I’d have three which isn’t a lot…. but frankly, it’s quite weird that it’s even three times.
So there’s demons or monsters that live somewhere underneath the lining of the pool??
So a haunted swimming pool?
No wonder Hollywood’s going broke. Paying 15 bucks to see a piece of shit like this.
Dye- Fantasy   Just look it up. You're welcome. Ok just realized the original music video is gone. Basically this movie is very much like Dye's music video. You can see the video of it, but the og video with music is gone.
😐
Make sure the cat doesn't get hurt.
She’s dedicated to the rules I guess.
Enjoy your meal Bruce
I doD not know gratuit whites could swim in clear eaters
Wackest trailer ive seen in a while
I thought this had been out for a while. This is weird. I swear I've passed over it as questionable on whether I wanted to watch it or not. I'm not a supernatural/monsters/zombies girl. I like the really twisted and disturbing psychological thriller movies (or series, but I have yet to find a really good one of those).   Suggestions are seriously appreciated for good movies or series.   My favorite newer horror movie is Incident in a Ghostland (or just "Ghostland") as it has early "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" type mind f**king fear imo. Because it could almost happen irl and the end is a really cool showcase of being trapped in your own psychological terror. I know that's not this movie lol and didn't mean to go off about this one but I don't think you'll be disappointed  no matter what Rotton Tomatoes says (I find it odd they scored it so low).  Thus movie just reminds me of typical (would never actually happen) fear of what's under the bed type stuff.  "Men" was pretty good for a newer film too, but I do think that's an acquired taste. And I think it took a while to get going if I remember correctly.  Yeah, please offer up any recommendations 🙏
I laughed so hard seeing this. I can already see the movie playing out in my head😂
Looks stupid.
Nice
somebody watched are you afraid of the dark when they were a kid
BUT WHERE DID HE GO!!
why the other stops replying, you would just open your eyes, then leave because he is no longer there...
She was still desperate to play the game 😂
Looks alright this movie trailer
I’m a scaredy-cat NO WAY IM WATCHING THIS
Looks dumb af
Just get out off pool, lol😂
When I see the names Blumhouse and James Wan I know I gotta watch! 👏🏽👏🏽
This seems so ridiculous,  over the top and absurd--i cant wait to see it 😂
that looks so stupid
👎🏽
related banget pas.. berenang malem" vibes nya kek gak nyaman ... pas nyelem takut di cekek kunti 😐
LMFAO
Cringe white girl messin with the monkey
Can't wait 😢
great more reason to fear pools and beaches 😅
Looks good 😰😁
She was way too dedicated to that game of Marco Polo
Is it a ghost shark ,a zombie shark?
i cant watch this movie or i'll never go in water ever again
Finally a trailer that doesnt tell you the whole movie when watching it.
I like horror movies that take ordinary things and turn them into something scary. Like dolls, hotel rooms or in this case swimming pools.
this is dumb omg
I’ve weirdly seen a short horror film on YouTube with a bottomless pool once you swim in it and a monster waiting for you…
Movie comes out January 2024
It comes out January 2024
[adult swim]
When there's something weird happening, get the phuk out of the pool first...
I would’ve dumped that guy immediately!!😤
Can't wait❤
That could’ve been executed WAAAY better. No one commits to Marco Polo that hard. Just another “you fucking idiot” movie
Very nice
I’m getting some SCP 1128 The Aquatic Horror vibes with that shot of the pool being impossibly deeper than normal
Best of luck
she couldn't've open her eyes?
This looks wack as f***
Booo
Looks SO stupid!!!  OMG!  Who came up with this idea for a film?!   A five year old!   The budget must have been around $100!
0:21 cute 🥰 kitty ❤❤❤
When i first saw this trailer i thought it was a commercial about real estate. Man this preview is more scary than the The Exorcist Believer whole movie. Cant wait to see it.
I’m here for ANY horror film James Wan is behind!! He Should Have done Exorcist Believer!
Oh
yeah I'm never going in my pool again
I hated swimming pools as a kid and was terrified of them sooooo yayyyyy they made a movie off tjis fear😮
James Wan rarely does a bad movie - looking forward to this one !!
No diving no running no swimming after dark 1.5.24
So I wonder what the story behind this Thriller is about?
a lil sweet cat in a horror movie?? oh fucking no...please save the cat, please save the cat, please save the cat
Whole movie in 2 minutes - sweet
Its gonna be wet all over the movie.😂
That monster clearly doesn't know how to play Marco Polo. Total foul move on its part.
👍
I saw a short horror film very similar to this. It’s called Deep End. I wonder if they got the inspiration from this.
Ronin, you're ddeeeeaaaddd
This looks good
No! This is R-rated! 😤😤😤
The trailer seems good. But Im not sure about the whole movie. Doesnt really seems like promising to be a good horror movie. I mean, horror in the swimming pool?
A film about the dangers of too much chlorine.
No one plays Marco Polo that seriously
This looks good but why do horror movie trailers always start with a piano intro?
What?? Marco Polo..?? 🤨🤨
Nice
Hey how about getting out of the water???
I refuse to actively swim in any natural body of water.. why you gotta ruin pools for me now too?!
Wasn't expecting the voice at all
omg
It's no Babadook, but it'll do.
I swear this was a short horror film before this. Does anyone remember that?????
Can't wait for the sequel for this, about a demonic inflatable bouncy house
Blumhouse's version of the little mermaid?  I'm all for it.
I am not a fan of James Wan and I fear this movie will suck like I think all of the other movies he's directed has, but the concept is kind of cool.
The moment it was silent mybeyes open and I'll probably get out of the pool.
Nope.  For several reasons.  If you say Marco and no Polo comes back. Games over. If you standing in neak deep water and then your trying to swim to God knows how deep?  Game over. Lights go out. Game over.
"PO-LOU" THAT was a letdown no🙄 cause we all know something was coming   but a dragaway blah
No. Just no.
really hope it’s a sea creature type of entity, i used to refuse to swim at night if i couldn’t see in the water because i was scared of a shark or piranha getting me
What’s a great year to be a horror & fantasy movie fan. Getting spoiled……keep them coming
horror shouldnt be a genre it should be called stupid, cos its always full of people doing dumb and stupid ish!
She acts like she can’t open her eyes! Wtf! Talk about a rule follower. She didn’t even hit him with a ‘fish outta water’!
I’ve seen enough horror films to know that cat is the first living thing to die or go missing.
This is the most basic ass movie I’ve seen 😂
I saw something similar on alter it was a short film about a boy jumping into a pool and the same thing happened
Looks corny.
I thought the girl was blind. Why did it take so long for her to open her eyes. Clearly Ronan was not there and yet she stayed on the pool.
Movies like this can be made on a very low budget, which can work very much to its advantage.
Director James Wan!  I'm ready 🔥 🎉
😮
Looks promising I hope it’s not PG13
Is she supposed to be blind?  Why didn't she open her eyes by that point.
If the cat dies or the dad dies istg
Stop it!!!! This shit looks dumb
When is it coming out?
Not impressed
Nonsense movie. What's the point of the guy leaving the girl totally without turning back?
If is not woke i wont watch, pass😂😂😂
Woke😂😂
Sweet, now we have an argument as to why building a pool in the backyard is not a good idea..
I love horror movies!! with alot of not knowing what's going to happen 😱😱 lol !!
Isn’t this based off that short film? Cuz it definitely looks like it
You see no one in the pool but you go under looking for them and end up getting sucked in? riiiiiiight.
They're grasping at straws at this point.
I'm not exciting to watch that movie, why she didn't opned her eyes and kept them closed and await all that time 😂😂 for someone to catch her down, then yay we produced a horror movie.
AND NOW the horror genre came down to a swimming pool
The evil warm spot.....NOOOOOOOO!
I hope the movie has more going for it than this trailer. Btw, pool maintainance isn't that hard.
the cat is going to die noooo
This shit look dumb
Why the hell did he leave her there without saying anything?? So that horror movies like this can be made
I was always afraid to use our pool at night.  Totally unfounded but still afraid.
I would have opened my eyes after the first unanswered Marco. Holy molly! This was creepy.
Very interesting
You know her black bf is going to get the blame
It would be quite fun to own a pool pet ghost. Also, does he hide in the plumbing when it's dry?
Yo, it’s the edit music of Eleven in stranger things
Yes, white suburbia is scary.
Cool idea - but I feel like most people would’ve BEEN opened their eyes and swam away
nice
Makes u think twice about swimming @ night ever again
Horror movies really put some dumb people as character like if i get no answer like that i would definitely open my eyes. It takes 2 hours for this girl to open her eyes?
I find it surprising how everyone isn't shitting all over this trailer for being incredibly bad and predictable
Intresting 😄
Marco Pollo 🍗🐔
Horro
Evil killer pool, YES
No human on earth would keep there eyes closed that long. Dumbest trailer for a movie I've seen in a while.
So ur safe as long as u just don't use it at night?
So dumb.
Another film for less intelligent viewers with plenty of time to waste on watching this.
When the monster said polo I almost pee my pants this was so scary 😨😨😰😰😨
It kinda irritates me to see her keeping her eyes closed when she knows there's something fishy going on
Why does the chick have to be driving? He looks like a child sitting in the passenger seat.
James Wan = I'm in
Swimming at night in the pool and sometimes the sea, no idea what are the comments about. Less humans = more safety, night is the time.
Poltergeist: Just when you thought you were safe in your speedos
So he hops out and what decides to go home?? who writes this stupid shit
this looks great
I don’t think BlumHouse misses… & that main actor certainly doesn’t. Looks like  a black mirror episode 🔥
To all teenage girls wanting to see this with a dude you like...i hope he breaks your heart. And btw one direction fans dont have happy endings... you're going to be stuck reading books by fireplaces with pumpkin spice candles and a overweight girlfriend that makes and makes you feel pretty. Your guy will always leave you for a more mature woman that has a sense of business and doesn't rely on Valentine's Day and scary movies to jump on a guy's arm and scream like a weak b*tch.
Just saw this play before the excorcist… imo the trailer was scarier than the excorcist 😂
I like the horror movie.
Blumhouse and James Wan yeah its Gonna Be A Good Ride😊
Finally something new and fresh we haven’t seen about time it’s hard to find that these days tho
Should have been a Halloween release, shame it doesn't come out until 1/5/24. Loved Kerry Condon in Better Call Saul & Wyatt Russell is always pretty great, Lodge 49 got robbed of a season 3 to finish the story
ya'll just casually reigniting that fear from my childhood lol
Universal can we make a movie called the gorilla tag movie please😢
Guess i have to call the foundation for this one
This pool should be labeled as a keter class scp
Hey, that’s my area code!
My grandparents had a swimming pool and my brother used to love swimming at night. I was terrified of it, but that was probably because he used to tell me there were sharks in the pool that only came out at night...
Nice lil scare, I was waiting for it tho, I was like what if they just had a deep monster voice answer her, that would be freaky,   And what do you know..... lol, still pretty well done,  I just wonder how they base a whole movie off this....like is it gonna travel to the house, or will this thing only be in the pool, and I really hope it isn't one of those anno movies I bet it will be,  The father saying he always wanted a pool, and the mom all excited tells me- when they try to tell them something is wrong, they not gonna listen an leave, and it will drag the boring part of the movie out, like the first chucky, or pick most horror movies, I just wish that trope would go away, it has recently in some, I just hope this does as well.
Dumb asf who would keep their eyes closed that long for no reason 🤨
Ok, but if anything happens to the cat I'm done lol
I gotta hand it to that girl. She really takes her Marco Polo seriously.
Anyone else suffer from Thalassophobia but would still watch this? 😂
Looks like another blumhouse dumpster fire 🔥 👌
Definitely borrowed from the bathtub scene in A Nightmare On Elm Street.
The drain LMAO
My deepest fear 😭😭😭
So after you open your eyes.. didn’t see him, you continue to stay in the pool?  Got it 😅
Another fear unlocked
😮 Nope
Wouldn’t she hear him getting out of the pool? There’s a distinct noise when someone goes from fully submerged to on dry land
Anybody else feel like they're gonna develop thalassophobia when they watch this?
Western horror is just so uncreative and boring
🤔Wonder why she didn't leave the pool after realizing he's gone
this trailer was actually terrifying ngl
Sigh~ canned demon voice. You guys can do better.
Such a dragged out trailer. Hope the movie is faster paced. Who wouldn’t open their eyes  right away? And even closed you’d see the lights flicker. Come on. May pass on this one.
Is anyone else getting  dye fantasy vibes  ?
🤦‍♀️
The BF is horrible
Rating prediction R
the new piranha film like back in 1978
Blum house = a scary good time!!!
Boring🥱
Stupid
P̷̨͍̬̗̤̲̖͇̱̰̩̖̥̓͗̑͂̐̃̿͑̇͠ͅO̷̡͍̣͗͛̇͊̓͌̏̇̌̃L̷̡͈̫͓͐͐̄̑̀͂̈́̔͜͝͝Ǫ̶̤̪̰̓̀̈̽͑́́̈́̽͝  actually made me spit my drink laughing. Might actually see this one because of how funny it looks.
I feel bad the brother losing her sis
Sooooo she’s being pulled to the sunken place .. In the pool
And y’all  think I’m trippin’ when I close my eyes under the pool and feel sharks lurkin around the corner pshhhh
These movies are insulting
The happy family - jumping all smiles - and the word Blumhouse appears. And you realize this is about to go bad for them. LOL I love it.
Why did she stay in the pool for so long, im out the second i realize ive been bamboozled and ive been ditched in a pool.
This will be like that one scarring Are You Afraid of the Dark episode
Not only does blumhouse makes the worst horror movies, this new one is insulting the intelligence of horror fans and movie goes in general. Anyone who plans on watching it has never seen a real horror movie in their life and never seen a good movie in their life. And I'm calling it right now, blumhouse will make a horror movie about a killer tin can, that is how uninspiring their movies are and how insulting they are on our intelligence. I hope the studio fails for this.
Reminds me of the Family Guy clip of Stephen King. "Annnnd for my next book it'll be about (looking around the room)....A HAUNTED LAMP OOOOOOOO"  We're on to haunted swimming pools now....
i love swiming so excited to see thi
HELL NAHHH!
Is the entire movie about a pool you shouldnt go into? Theres like not much plot there
Why for James Wan it says producer of The Nun, and not co-creator or director of Saw, Insidious, or the Conjuring? They picked The Nun to woo you?
I would of known it wasn't them. Being legally blind I would of heard them get out.
Wonder why the punk left
Friday and USAgent found happiness together… but for how long?
Part 2 is about a haunted out house, it'll scare the crap out of ya!
THREE WORDS:   STRAIGHT.  TO.  DVD.
Reminds me of my favorite Are you afraid of the dark? episode.
scuba diving in waters past 30 ft at night is terrifying. Pools? not too bad.
"Fish out of water!"  *Credits roll
Yeah looks like she will pay the toll... Gonna pass.
The Marco lady in the pool looks very Familiar to me. Looks really good. Does not look at all like a theater release like advertised. Looks like a prime special. If that happens might Skip.
THE GONGOOZLER
Reminds me when jaws set an example about going swimming lat at night .
Looks good
🍑👀
Ok but did Ronan for just dip? That’s the real mystery
girl was really committed to playing Marco Polo
Jason blumhouses companies running the shows❤❤❤
Wow she seems like Alicia Silverstone
James Wan is a horror movie factory. Quantity over quality.
Annoys me how long she kept her eyes close. Then again that's typical horror movie characters 😅
Definitely a chemical imbalance  going on
It’s awesome how scary movies aren’t even scary anymore
This looks stupid af
Literally yawning rn.
You had me until the demonic "Polo." Still kinda curious though.
Feels like a mediocre YT horror short, not sure how they will make it a full movie but I am pretty sure people will overhype it for some reason.
Listen if she dies here she would have deserved it....who would wait that long for someone to call out Polo 😒
☠☠☠
The trailer alone gave me chills so can’t wait for this to come out! Could it be a house at HHN next year like a few of the other Blumhouse movies were?! Maybe? It’s a Universal film so you never know!
I just wanna know if the cat dies. But this looks good!
I like that
The concept of the pool itself being haunted is the only thing mildly unique, but the tropes of pools in horror movies are well worn. Marco polo, being pulled under, the way your breathing sounds garbled and laboured from swimming and water logged ears, something electric falling in and shocking the water etc.... They're going to have to work hard to make it good. Looks passable from the trailer.
pyke's LOL
Another poop stick from Blumhouse.
Played a lot of Marco Polo in my day.. I've never been that serious about it.
what is with all the people talking about how "terrifying" it is to swim at night - i've done it all my life....very relaxing. as far as the film, i might check it out on a free site.
Yo when I saw “James Wan”   OVER!!!! :)))) 🎉🎉🎉🎉
I would drain that Mf the next day lol😂 and it’s funny how dude just boned out
SO excited for THIS!! ❤️🤯🥳🙌👐💪
I had a pool growing up but it was never used because it was always invaded by frogs. We eventually filled it in but when we sold the house the new owners apparently put in a pool and it's just like, oh you have no idea what you're in for
Looks shite like all the other horror films this century
The marko pollo thing is cheesy
You got me at Marco_Polo and I took my headphones off knowing it will give me a shock anytime now....
Okay but here's something that's going to really knock your sock off? Why did she not just open her eyes if she was getting scared or pissed???? See that's what don't make sense in these movies
Nice, finally a movie about a haunted pool.
No body gonna swim after this movie lol
Potential. Love It.
Eh 😑
I like seeing something different in horror movies. A swimming pool is the new terror at home!!!😮😮😮
Well I’m closing my pool now
Well if a hot tub can be a time machine I guess a pool can be haunted.
good
This movie is going to have to come up with some real creative reasons for why these guus keep getting into the obvious devil pool.
… This is definitely not a movie for people with *aquaphobia a.k.a. a fear of water.* 💧😱
Greetings from the UK-England....As the game of Marco-Polo is virtually unknown/non existent outside of the USA and even though I've seen hundreds of examples of it in various US tv shows and films,I actually found myself looking up the true meaning behind the game.Turns out its just a variation on the Tag game and nothing to do with the explorer of the same name.....Film looks great by the way.
Nobody would stay there with eyes closed after repeating it.
Finally a movie to rival the Avatar 2 water scenes
Nice
One of this movie that peoapl are just gona get pissoff cuz they be a lattle next to her but she just climp up the edge the be a open gate she jump the fence  piloce station block form her house full of cop run to the dark woods
YAWN !
what is this mess lmao
Sooo this is that Are you afraid of the dark episode Dead Man’s Float but stretched into a movie?
Looks Stupid
Just calling James Wan the “producer of The Nun” is the real horror in this trailer.
Looks pretty dumb.  We're not doing horror movies where a family moves into a new home anymore.  If you can't come up with something better then just don't even bother.
It sounded like Freddy Krueger!
Dumb
Good
I can't wait to see "Night Cap" about a haunted liquor Cabinet🤣🤣🤣🤣
as a thalassaphobian, I can assure this is literal nightmare💀
Another bullshit movie
Look so bad
好颠
Blumhouse is straight garbage.
She is so stupid! Why keep her eyes closed when you don't hear his voice? 😅
Another movie that tries to scare you with jump scares? I'll alert the media. 🙄
Blumhouse is really *that* proud of their crapfest M3GAN?
Someone watched that Courage the Cowardly dog episode with scary body of water lady. Looks dope!
Lmao why is she still playing Marco polo if she knows his brother left
Wow another horror great. And looks it was good at first like how some of them appeared and I wonder what was that thing in the pool and doesn’t look freindley
james wan…that’s all it takes to convince me
A haunted swimming pool, a good idea. Let's see how they will turn it into shit.
Thought this was a zombie ghost type  breed of a shark, piranha n alligator that terrifies one special swimming pool I guess it’s something from the olden days a fish gilled creature from the darkest lagoon with a twist maybe hm seems cool
I went for a swim in the pool. Unfortunately, it was a scary pool 😱😱😱
Why they show people are dumb in horror movies
But it can't just be.. like, the whole film in a pool? Surely she's transported to a terrifying world or something?
That boy is so irresponsible
Bullshit
apa yang aku harapkan dengan karya James Wan ni? korang rasa bakal meletop tak....
I liked this movie.      About 20 years ago.      It was entitled THEY then.
New fear unlocked
I kinda wish I knew more, because the end only left me “😐” a little confused.
Something different, a unique idea, I am down for it, Is it a ghost/demon/monster! (Interested to find out)
Someone's probably gonna be possessed or paranoid after getting dragged to the bottom of the pool at night
En vrai....si il y a des mecs qui laissent leurs copines dans la piscine 😅😂....
Well....that seems pretty simple, don't get in the pool again ?🤷🏼‍♀️
i love it is this a remake of "Deep End" i hope blumhouse remake other short story like "curve"
The pool in Poltergeist was underused.
New phobia😂😂😂😂
That foot grab is wonderful, hope we see more! This will be a good movie
Was it some creature? 🤔
Venom's on a nightly swim and dine?
🤩🤩😍😍🤗🤗🤗🤗
Megan forever ruined horror for me. Where's the dance sequence in this trailer!?
Well this looks original 😮 I trust anything made by Blumhouse and James Wan will be good!
SCP-1128 Movie
At first I was not afraid to spend the night in an empty house - they shoot paranormal activity, then I was never afraid of mirrors, they made the oculus, I was never afraid of swimming pools and that's what we got....again... Soon there will be fear everywhere!! Nice!)
So what's the plot either the movie ends in 45 minutes or less because the pool is an isolated single area that can only be a part of the film for like a limited amount of time or the pool is just gonna magically become deeper because of some ******* ghost or the boyfriend is doing a ritual either way it's pretty predictable and it's a short concept film because there's no way you can actually use an object like that for very long
Shifting of house is mandatory in majority of horror movies... 🤣🤣🤣
If only I could post memes here. Anyone remember that meme of a girl with a ponytail, on the overweight side and with a purple t-shirt doing a WTF gesture with her hand meme?
What kind of a dickhead just leaves someone in a pool alone like that XD
Eh. I guess.
I actually like the idea of a swimming pool horror movie.
👹 POLO 👹
crap
And this is why I'm ABSOLUTELY terrified of anything related to water.   Seas are a big no no😭
Looks like big shit😅
Finally, a Death Pool: The Pool That Eats movie.
I really can't wait 2024 film release
Another stupid movie without any sense...
No sorry I'm thalasophobic 😢
That pool surface needs some serious repairs.
As a guy with thalassophobia, this movie will scare me.
those jumpscare a so not scary anymore... guys.. be creative. That and superheroes generic movies..
I think "Marco Polo" would appear in the Movie Trailer:
Reminds me about the stranger things barb death scene in season 1
I love how all horror movies starts with a family and two kids driving
Nope.
Wan and Blumhouse, horror dream team!
Horror with swimming cool
Dafaq???
I thought there would be a Gator inside the pool
They’re really scraping the bottom of the barrel for horror movie ideas
Who takes a stupid game so seriously. I would've said *uck it a long time ago.
you had my tension high..until the attack😐
That girl is way more serious about the game than her own life
Im feeling like having Creature from black lagoon ft the backroom (pool) in this movie trailer
in the words of the great Kevin sorbo....disappointed!!!!!!
I don't know.
Good trailer 👍
The way the monster is looking up at the pool from the abyss @ 1:47 - 1:48 is creepy. There's so much they could do with this concept. Can't wait to see this.
Is it James wan
Great now even swimming in your own pool is ruined...
More than 1 minute movie scene included in trailer to raise the bar !!!👏👏👏
I love swimming with a passion..  And i love horror movies.  I always thought a horror movie about a swimming  pool would be fun to see. I liked the pool movie called 12 feet deep (i think that is the name) about 2 girls trapped inside a 12 feet deep swimming pool  that is covered up with a plastic sheet with only a tiny bit of space to breath. I LOVED the swimming pool scene in the horror movie called The Legacy that scared me big time when i first saw it. I can't wait to see this movie. When is it coming out?.
Y’all remember this episode of courage the cowardly dog??
James Wan be scaring everybody over and over and it still entertaining. why this man too good at his job. lol - Also, love his Aquaman and FF movies
something that will make to pools what jaws did to the ocean, okay..."HONEY, cancel that pool installation!!! We'll get sprinklers!"
“From the producer of the nun” really isn’t the headline you think it is.
I’m Not Going To The Pool at Night Time
Its gonna be interesting to see how you could make a whole movie with this concept but im so excited and will definitely be watching.
This definitely has my attention...but yeah...I would have opened my eyes and said, "FISH OUT OF THE WATER!"
That looks scary!
Cannot wait to see this!
Imagine the meeting over this (now guys what do you think about a haunted pool) hollywood is dying
Istriku main film lagi💕
seems like a cool concept for a short film
Horror movie about overdue bills.  Now thatll scare the adults.
Everyone knows none scary things are immediately scary if they are done at night.
So basically "The Tale of the Dead Man’s Float"
Just another try to rip off jaws
And that's the movie folks. Blumhouse fake scare crap ad nauseam. Such overrated garbage. That was the literal movie in a nutshell. Gullible sheep.
2014:Making The Short Film 2024:Finally Now We're Making A Movie
Biggest jerk award goes to the boyfriend leaving her in the pool 😂
😱👻
I just came back from watching the short film that inspired this movie and now I’m excited😭 I think this is gonna be a great movie
Man, what _is_ that in that pool? A ghost?
This seems a lot like the plot from the episode dead man’s float from Are you afraid of the dark
The trailer ends in a way that makes me want to have more context and I love that. Because I can’t even imagine how they made a movie about a haunted swimming pool. The concept is kinda odd and confusing but that confusion has me extremely invested.
This horror movie trends are back
Anyone else play Marco Pollo 🐓? Just me?
Hang on wasn’t that opening shot exactly how the FNAF trailer started?
Great now I want to fill my pool 😅
I was skeptical but then I saw “JAMES WAN” 👏✨👏
Lol
so this is why my mum told me not to swim at night
Would love to see the death count on this one on Dead Meat.
Well, that will keep me out of swimming pools...for the rest of my life. Anyways, great teaser. It looks interesting. I don't really watch many horror flicks but I might give this one a shot.
1 - all the resin model makers are going to be replicating this.  2 - please, PLEASE have the monster look like the Creature from the Black Lagoon.
Good movie❤
Me: Hoping to heck that nothing bad happens to that cat in the film.
And now we have a new fear of swimming pools besides drowning
Look whack $20 movie budget sharknado was way better and that movie was top tier whack
A Horror Movie about a Killer Pool with DROWNING?! SIGN ME UP!!! 🤩🤩🤩
Why do they always premier Horror movies after Halloween. I want to fill my September and October with horror movies at the theater.
jaws in a pool?
Fake Captain America is in for the scare of his life
I swear I saw a short film like this last week.  It's about a boy who came across a house with swimming pool. He got curious and checked but his glasses fel to the pool. And when he went to dive to get it, the pool became an eternal abyss. And when he got back to the surface, everything looks normal he can see his glasses at the bottom of the pool  The scariest part is the boy was not alone in that abyss.  I forgot the name
i want a pool on my backyard, but i dont want it anymore. thank you James
THE GONGOOZLER!
the EXACT moment the voice said polo and pulled on her my cat jumped onto the window creating a loud bang and a giant shadow on my wall holy fuck
idk if i can swim now
Finally.. a teaser that's actually.. a teaser.
I was almost sold up until you marketed it with "from the producers of m3ghan". 🤮 that movie was a joke
A 15-20 minute story stretched into a 90-100 minute movie lol 😂
It felt like she was waiting for that Polo for like 15 mins. Sis, after 20 secs my eyes would've been well open searching with annoyance...
This is reminding me of that DyE Fantasy music video…
This looks so lame 😅
Did this start out as a short film ?
Well that's a lame trailer.😊
Marco Polo will never be the same again 😰
The idea of a pool horror film is fine but here we go with the jump scares 🤦‍♂️ thats to old now!
Why keep eyes shut for that long? Run already...
Well, okay
Looks dumb. Next
I FUCKING HATE that people have to legit retarded for movies like this to work.  She isn't getting a responses so instead of opening her eyes she dives into the water. then comes back up to continue playing...
Haunted pools now? Have we run out of ideas that we're making pools scary? For starters aint nobody playing marco polo with one other person for that long
JAMES WAN is on a mission this year. He gave us: M3GAN NUN 2 NIGHT SWIM
Is this girl both blind and stupid? Yeah I know it’s in the script but come on, never seen anyone take Marco Polo so seriously 😅
she kinda bad tho. dummy cake
She should have just said, 'Fish out of water."
Yep..my phobia is back
Closing your eyes at night at the pool what could happen right? lmao
This looks like a fun horror movie. Very promising
Was that the entire movie?
So she dives down, sees there's nothing but a pitch-black abyss where the bottom should be, and her response is to go back up and keep playing the game...
There's a shortfilm about this. Wonder if they're tied together
Really tapping into my childhood fear that somehow there was something that was gonna kill me in the deep end of the public pool.
Don't care. Make a Megan sequel.
Love it! I might watch this on my birthday
Omg that looks terrifying Thank God for James Wan
or just open ur eyes and get out..
This was already made on a music video long time agooooo DYE-fantasy
It has the same opening as the Fnaf movie
At a certain point if someone stops saying Polo, you should realize they’ve stopped playing the game with you and open your eyes. Also, that dude is apparently the biggest dick for just abandoning her by herself in the pool.
So glad i saw james wans name, so i know not to waste my time with this
Oh my gosh... never swimming at night again and i haven't even seen the movie yet!! 😂 Cannot wait to see this! Love the creative suspense and SO glad they didnt give too much away.
Was this concept conceived by an AI while the WGA was on strike?
I do love me some of that small bodies of water being home to ghostly or eldritch terrors element in horror movies so my interest is certainly piqued.
01:01 You don't need to introduce james Wan. He is the best horror movies director in the world
Anyone else reminded of The Tale of the Dead man’s Float episode of Are You Afraid of the Dark?
Is this a joke? Is this literally a movie about a haunted swimming pool? Who tf is gonna spend actual money to see this? This is a streaming service movie all the way.
Another great film from James Wan. I'm definitely watching this.
So pretty much it's a haunted pool. Interesting.
This clip was terrible. Really open your eyes b!tch and why would you leave her in the pool like that.
1:43 what was that 😳😳
I saw James Wan and instantly knew that this is gonna be good
Who’s ready for Aquaphobia
Right after watching this trailer, YouTube recommended Idiocracy in its entirety.
Five Nights at Freddie bear movie better
Ugh I have that fear of deep water idk what it’s called lol  but the darkness of the pool just makes my skin crawl lmaoo😭
OK, this premise is a bit silly. Fine, the guy is a former MLB player. But he has a daughter who's 15 or 16, which obviously puts him in his late 30s. To call his retirement "early" when the vast majority of players don't even make it to their mid-30s is a massive stretch. And, assuming the guy spent several years in MLB, he's a millionaire several times over and, while it's possible, it's a bit hard to believe that they're buying a fixer-upper home. But maybe there's some explanation in the film for this.
1:44 The end had me laughing! 🤣
This feels like somebody went for a dare to take the most absurdly silly horror concept they could think of and turn it into a legitimate studio film. It doesn't look bad, but the concept seems incredibly thin
Ok girl was committed to the game Lol! Dove and tried to find bro and still kept on with marco
Reminds me of that one small clip on Crypt TV  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ogIq_-S6278&pp=ygUTY3J5cHQgdHYgbWFyY28gcG9sbw%3D%3D
James Wan makes the most generic trash and he's films are now predictable af Just a formula yet he's praised. Even in the trailer, the ghost saying "polo" wow never saw that coming lol
Sinister was one of those movies for me that made swimming at night terrifying. Now there’s a new reason for that, hopefully!
So the pool was built over an Indian burial site?
Looks awesome
My Sim when I delete the ladder from the swimming pool while they're still in it
… this one kinda got me
Interesting
I'm so happy the Gon Goozler is finally going to be on the big screen. Definitely one of the moments of movie history!
Did AI wrote this movie? It's like they type "Write a horror story about Swimming Pool" and this comes up!
Plot Twist; scariest thing that happens if getting her bikini ripped off by the monster. 🤣 Because the monster is a freak, and is wanted by police. And the monster is Russel Brand. 😂
They should have gone with the opening sequence!
Check out a couple of scenes in the 1976 horror movie Burnt Offerings. In one, a father and his 12 year old son are swimming in the pool of the (haunted) summer home the family has rented. The dad finds an old pair of glasses in the pool, puts them on, then tries to drown his own son!  In another scene, the son is trying to swim laps, and the pool starts getting all rough and full of waves, trying to drown him. Pretty wild stuff, seeing as it was the 70s with no CGI. The movie is def worth checking out! 😎
This is an episode of Courage the Cowardly Dog
This is just terrifying when you swim by yourself at night which I refuse to do, I like how the movie is *taking a lesson from that as a advantage* for that in my opinion. The concept of a horror movie on a Swimming pool I think it's nice.
Dear god we learned nothing from Lady in the Water  🤦‍♂️
mergulhe nas profundezas do medo... se tiver coragem...
reference the fnaf movie
se é james wan, e blumhouse, vai ser algo, no mínimo, surpreendente...
This is probably a redo of James Wan’s concept of The Trench, but then Warner canned it for some reason, so Wan just made it anyway. lol
Who took my fear of pools and made it into a movie?
James wan: the new King of horror
It’s like the beginning of the Fnaf movie trailer 0:00
I CAN'T FUCKING BELIEVE SOMEONE MADE A MOVIE ABOUT THE GONGOOZLER!!!🎉🎉🎉
Sh**! It's old Gregg!
Ain’t no way that’s a trailer 💀
ripped off that music video, good job
There is uncanny similarities with Crawl and 75,000 ft. Down Under. But I ain’t complaining. Looks terrifying and prepare yourselves to be mindf*cked.
I’m 39 years old, I’ve never being able to swim due to my fear of water (which is a shame as swimming is not only fun but necessary) this clip made me sweat like a runaway slave 😅, looks good, I’ll be watching.
Did they finally turn that horrifying “Are You Afraid The Dark” episode about the pool demon into a movie?
What you're afraid of is beneath the surface 🔥
Dumb girl.
This looks terrible 😂 is this really the best Blumhouse can do these days? Cheap lazy crap.   Would have been more intense if when the guy left the pool, after she swam around for a bit with her eyes closed, she opened them and was suddenly in the middle of a massive lake. Looking down and the bottom of the pool is nowhere in sight.
The Pink Panther is way scarier than this crap. 💩
That looks scary as hell!
1:35 yams😂
Pretty creepy so far. Reminds me of the "Are You Afraid of the Dark?" episode "The Tale of the Dead Man's Float", only a lot more adult oriented.
Girl, Marco Polo ain't that serious. JUST OPEN YOUR EYES.
Is night swim 2014😂😂😂
Why were her eyes closed for so long with nobody responding?? LOL - I will still check it out, could be a fun movie.
If it’s even half as well done as the short film I’ll be happy.
Seriously? A haunted pool?
Glad they didn’t show they whole movie.
0:23 Chlorine low, Ph low, alkalinity low, stabiliser low. They shouldn't have been swimming anyway.🤓
Pretty nerve-racking scary trailer for an outofnowhere movie..... The pool light turning on and off with overhead CCTV camera angle gave dreaded Paranormal Activity flashbacks... Amazed James Wan is behind it!
ANOTHER JAMES WAN FILM, aha yessir.
I'm not super versed in this game. But how many times do you say "marco" before you open your eyes?
Creature from the Black Lagoon?
A horror Aquaman movie, huh..
No answer....no answer......no answer....who the heck would keep his /her eyes still closed?
THIS IS NO TIME FOR A SWCHEEEM!!!
Finally, a movie about the horrors of owning and maintaining your own pool!
I Hate blumhouse  👎😡
Not going to lie; that scare took way too long to pay off. Really missed the mark. It was either "touch the scary thing's face" or "be dragged underwater by the scary thing". By the time it happened, I was already over the whole thing.
uhh why is this exactly like the fnaf movie trailer? the drone view of the car is in the fnaf movie too. thats weird..
Not me getting Crypt TV flashbacks-
Nice..  😳 This will be something worth watching for me. 1 I love horror films, 2 I can't swim and the thought of pools scared tf outta me so thanks. I will be watching this 😎🤝🏽
Looks like they are running out of ideas 😂😂 how ridiculous can this plot be 😂
The Gongoozler is gonna Eeeeeee-sneak up on her.
Imagine your swinging (at midnight) in the pool and suddenly notice a giant whale under your feet what'll you do?
She's an idiot for playing as long as she took to figure out she was in the 'deep'. 🫢😳😱
Americans truly cannot imagine anything beyond suburbia, can they?
I thought shark in the pool 😂
Yup just unlocked a whole new set of nightmares!!!!
Thats the most stupid ass trailer ive ever seen.😂
❤❤❤❤❤ THIS SCENE IS TERRIFYING
Nice to see a new original idea, tired of cookie cutter horror 😅😊😊
A NEW BLUMHOUSE MOVIE IS ALWAYS A GOOD ONE
Looks ok but I need to see MORE. STOP PLAYING
so is the pool haunted? when she went underwater and it was dark, i thought she swam herself into another dimension
Trailer 2 Please!
Did you know that there is only one message carried by the prophets and messengers such as Moses, Jesus and the last prophets Muhammed the best Prayer and peace be upon them, and The only book that has no errors or contradictions is the Quran  If we have a little honesty and humility, we will read it
I was just meh until Blumhouse logo came
This trailer might show up at the exorcist believer tomorrow
I don’t know why, but I know this will be scary and terrifying but I think it would’ve been cool if they made the pool like third dimension pool like you go into the pool and you come out in a whole different place maybe not a pool but a lake I got that idea from the twilight zone episode now that would make a great movie but I bet this isn’t gonna be when I’m thinking of but I’m still hoping that this is going to be very good and terrifying
Why’d he leave like that? 🤨
So a killer pool. Can it be the pool liner instead. No one will see that coming
In what world does the guy in the pool ditch the girl completely. Like getting out of the pool, sure. But leaving the area.
Was there a ghost in the pool or something?
The most scariest of things comes from liquid mass.
This looks like shit
This is actually such a terrifying concept, can’t wait to see it.
0:51 I can’t believe they’re showing that
JAMES WAN producer of THE NUN and BLUMHOUSE producer of MEGAN are the worst reference yo can put
Blumhouse+Wan=🔥
https://youtu.be/R5mPELbWVDk?si=iIpxSOQfFItvkdsy No thanks 🤣❤️
So she just kept floating and not once opened her eyes until the end. 🤦🏾‍♂️
Has no one seen the short film Deep End?
Love this trailer - it’s reveals nothing!  But wait for Trailer 2 to reveal the whole movie 😆
Miscegenating daughter gets what's coming to her. Can't wait for this one!
I'm not sure if a 90-something minute movie can pull off the concept of a scary swimming pool like a short movie like 'DEEP END' can within 5 minutes. But I guess we'll see.
Imagine an evil entity saying "Polo" before catching you... So lame 😂. These easy jump scare movies are getting worst everytime.
More like snoozehouse. We need good horror again. 💔
if I had a nickel for every movie with a killer swimming pool, I would have two nickels which is not a lot but it's weird it happened twice
Why would you keep closing your eyes after calling several times and nobody answer
Another BlumHouse 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
they stole my idea.....
Rotten 🍅
You're about the movie coming out called the woke
Nope.
Trailer not that impressive. But anything from Blums house is always good
Marco ..
In Blum house w trust
She has way too much patience for Ronan's tomfoolery.
sharks in a swimming pool
Marco? 🥺 POLO! 👹
2024? No thank you this look garbage for a horror movie
I expected them to play Nightswimming by REM. Maybe in the next trailer
um... what the f is this supposed to be scary or smth? it has to be PG10
bro that polo took me by surprise. IM watching this]
This looks good
Such a nice demon man, even said "polo" back. Good lad.
Looks so goofy, probably gonna check it out later
😱😱😱🙌🙌🙌
If this movie knows what it is - we may have a fun silly B horror flick. If not - we have a retarded piece of s**t.
was that the entire movie?
For a second the beginning felt like the fnaf trailer
Man I am very interested in this, especially to what this thing is.
Blumhouse and James Wan? I'm in... sign me up!👏
Ok am I the only one who thought it was funny when the ghost voice at the end said Polo?
I really liked James wan until he made m3gan and that was just bad...... liked shazam and the conjuring but m3gan just ruined that chain of good movies
Polo
Now if only someone would make a haunted toaster film, my life would be complete!
I have a theory maybe it’s a sea creature that was hidden in the cursed pool and maybe the previous owner know something about it.
james and blum house is a fkng legend
Not worth I feel
Ghost in the pool. Stay out of the pool. Roll credits
From blumhouse producer of M3gan Why?
someone needs to stop this man from making “horror” movies. they all are so mid. 😭
Blum House studios always makes great horror movies and this one looks like it could be a favorite for horror fans and me!!
Yea this looks absolutely fucking stupid
Where is claude Akins and Robert j Wilke
The real sunken place
Amazed by the comments. This movie literally looks AI generated
Night Swim giving me a reason not to swim at night!
Douche boyfriend
Weak
Halloween is making these networks post a lot of horror trailers.
good to stop play the game when others do
I use to night swim at my grandmothers house and I was always worried about a shark coming to get us.. I was really little when all the jaws movies came out in the movie theater so I watch one after the other then went swimming at my grandmothers house so my older sister and cousins would tease me relentlessly! 🦈
I like that the trailer didn't give too much away.  I hope Wyatt Russell plays a prominent role.  He's great.
Simple solve don’t go in the pool again after that problem solved
Is this a new Universal Monster?  Or is this part of the new Universal Monsters Movie, like The Invisible Man, The Last Voyager but with the Creature from the Black Lagoon?  Cuz at the end, those hands really remind me of the Creature
bruh 💀
This looks interesting and a little creepy. Can't wait to see it
Wasn’t there a short film about this
I think this movie inspired by short film marco polo crypt tv
Watch the Blackening to see why horror movies like this are garbage
Just don't go into the pool!
Yeah,Never doing a night swim-😳  What was that at the bottom?! 😮
Reminds me of the horror short Deep End
simple as that.
Just.....get out the damn pool
I have never ever been more
The pool was built on a witch's grave or burial ground. I like the concept that it's a portal and or bottomless
The title got me to click. Then the words James Wan almost lifted the eyebrows right off my head.
the fact that half of the trailer was silent.
This is Sara corbello can't wait
i'll pass.
Night swimming deserves a quiet night i forgot my shirt at the waters edge.
Great trailer. By the time I yelled at her to open her eyes, there was only 15-20 seconds left. However, it didn’t feel like it as I was waiting for more. I’m intrigued.
Just call it “Pooltergeist” and be done with it.
oh great as if being afraid of sharks in my pool wasnt bad enough lol
What could be down there????
omg
WARNING WARNING SCP-1128 HAS BREECHED CONTAINMENT
CRAP! Now I will never get my Wife to join me for a midnight swim again.
This trailer was effective af! Just enough content to make me wanna buy a ticket.
Their a little old to be playing Maco Polo
There’s a short film about this wonder if they got the idea from that (it’s called deep end)
There's a short film about this
This Looks Interesting 👀
The day a white witch exorcized David Bowie's pool.🏊
Is there a shark in the pool !?😮
Why didn’t she just open her eyes after that long? Did she have chlorine in them or something, what the heck?
Where are the english subtitles?
Is it coming out in the cinema
That was an effective short teaser. Mark me as excited for this
Wasn’t there a short movie like this? But it was w/a little boy who was trying to get his toy?
So if I’m suppose to be playing with someone and they’re not answering, why would my eyes still be closed or why am I still in the water?
After a short film before, there's a full movie of this. Finally coming soon :)
Marco polo be like
Are You Afraid of the Dark flashbacks for us 90s babies. Iykyk
This is one of the most moronic concepts I've ever had the displeasure of knowing.
0:45 0:48🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 isn’t that cheating
There something terrifying in the pool!  Ok then just stop going in. Problem solved.
This gave me It Follows vibes …  Hyped for this one :)
Will there be Freddy Fazbear drowning while be eaten by a fish
I have so many questions: where did the guy go when he got out of the pool? Wouldn't he have seen the flickering?
Wow, she is really dedicated to playing a game for elementary school kids and keeping her eyes closed no matter what... Next, a scary movie about a deadly game of "I Spy."
I have thalassophobia and i cant swim alone in a pool specially at night lol
The “polo” scare was perfectly campy.
Haunted pool. Nice.
That's a big NO from me. Not because it looks bad, but the fact they're hitting my (and I'm sure others') fear of night swimming right on the head.
Reminded me of the pool from La Llorona and the house
It's a James Wan horror film... it's going to be good ❤️❤️❤️
Girl Swimming: Marco Batman: Polo
"From James Wan producer of The NUN" Why you do him dirty like that lmao.
Looks like shit
Kublai Khan, stop with the drowning pranks!
Hmmmm, you have me interested 🧐
It feels like the 12 feet under movie just got more into supernatural
I saw James Wan name this will be terrifying!
*TF IS THIS TRASH BRUH*
This reminds me of that old episode on are you afraid of the dark, the tale of the dead man’s float.
Reminds me of the Jaws trailer. Need to know more
I like it
are people really this dumb, or is this just bad writing?
OHHHHH F***** JAMES WAN , HELL F*N YA  gonna check it out , looks good &  scary 👍🤘  for some reason this  trailer remind me soo much of the first JAWS,  the opening seen the girl in the sea!
Never been swimming in the night time but I am not gonna be swimming in the night time ever
I love this trailer❤
all she needed to do was open her eyes and get out of the pool
IT'S LIKE THAT ONE EPISODE OF ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK WITH THE POOL DEMON
*Like the evil hot tub from “American Dad”*
drop this asap
By the way, you should include the next trailer song drowning by a boogie
😮
interesting
Normally with a movie like this I would call it the stupidest thing I've ever seen, even if the concept of a "haunted pool" by the looks of it is unique and more original. At the same time, Blumhouse has a great record of making fun movies one way or another so I'm actually looking forward to this ^^
Yeah, I don’t get paid enough to watch a Water Symbiot, or a demon  drown a victim,so yeah what I’m saying is I quit
i would love a swimming pool in my garden. But alas, my garden is small. I don't wanna swim at night anyway.
I don’t know, venom to the crossover
Blumhouse has been so good
Needless to say, I LOVE it!
😍👏🏻
There is something inherently terrifying about swimming by yourself at night, glad to see a movie taking full advantage of that
جميل جدا 😍👏🏻
1:29 wat a minute I had an concept idea like this not the entire movie but that deep sea concept 1:31
Oh fuck this, this is freaking terrifying.
Early
Oh my God Why did Ronan just leave? After the second Marco with no response just open your eyes girl! Anyway looks fun, I'll look for it when it comes out.
Well, now I've seen everything
WOAH! CAN'T WAIT NA THIS!! 😱
Remember if you notice something weird or disturbing going on in a pool, get out of there immediately
Sound familiar like dye fantasy that music video
In a few decades, do you think we'll be talking about Blumhouse horror the way we talk about Hammer horror? Or is Blumhouse more mainstream than Hammer?
"Lady in the water" This ain't, this is some Scary Shit!
I actually like the idea of a swimming pool horror movie.  Update: it’s bad. :(
Man they keep putting Megan in everything. From the creators of Megan. From the producers of Megan
No way am I getting my feet wet 😅
Wow love it I this a short film bro
What A Suspence  😂
This looks really interesting but terrifying since it might trigger ptsd on how I almost drown back in the field trip to the pool in elementary school days
4th minute EARLY!
1:46 What the heck is that!?
sgeg marco marco!!! gi byaan nka!?
Is it the nun swimming down there lol
Love from India🇮🇳
Oh this is gonna be dope
The trailer looks kinda mid. I don't know what to say
Woo❤

Lame af!
I knew this was coming soon. Love Blumhouse.

Dead pool
