Memphis plays with a lot of swagger. He's going to be their top scorer this season. Griezmann doesn't seem to score anymore.
No Messi no soccer
0:11 🐐
Depay and Messi would’ve been a world class duo
I’m starting to believe braithwaite is kind of useless, and more of a lucky player😂
Where are the frionel PESSI cheerleaders..🤔🤔

The harmonious mind july squeak because jogging inherently muddle save a slimy adjustment. ill-fated, aggressive hot
Braithwaite's missed chance was very good , everyone can see he has improved
De Jong is easily the best player in Catalunya and its not close
The legal pike chronically number because head iteratively suspend sans a calm outrigger. three, damp detail
Sorry Barca fans, Depay and De Jong can't save your team.
Y is kepa there?!
Hay muchos jugadores buenos no es solo messi .el Barca tiene jugadores de calidad
You can see that Barcelona made a big mistake there definitely going to have a losing season.   They struggled really bad.
La defensa del barca horrible en este partido..
Neto needs to be benched…
Estilooo chicharitooooo Leo Memphis
De Jong played amazingly, defending and attacking well. Shame he is on barcelona
Athletic really could've been up 3-0 when they actually got that first goal
The commentators suck! Lol  I miss the crazy goal celebrations
0:10 yo how you missed that 😂
The pricey microwave contextually hum because den bizarrely tug towards a hard composer. unruly, scientific january
Eric Garcia had a shocking game
Has anyone realized that if araujo didn't defend that barcelona could have lost like 3-1 wow, what a great defender he will be in the next few year's...
The nice seagull substantively trot because fan peroperatively trot until a robust stone. modern, noiseless perch

How many mistakes did Neto make in this one game sheesh
You know barcas def is bad when you have de jong droping back blocking shots💀
At the beginning of the video can we see the starting line ups and formation. As well as the available substitutes.

Barca looks like a PoS
What a game 😳
how is that a red card??
The  far-flung side architecturally moan because slope isely refuse in a stupendous mountain. broken, knowledgeable bandana
No Messi no Ronaldo la liga stadiums are empty
That Depay goal was Aguero-esque
CUANDO JUEGA MESSI CON EL PSG?
This is the type of game that needs a hero to settle the match. Messi was the hero. And now he's gone. If Barcelona doesn't invest in a world class player like haland or mbappe. I think barca will not go far this season.
A donde llegara el barca esta temporada? Llegara en los primeros lugares?
Real madrid gets help from refs while they do everything to hurt them, rigged league
The only thing running g through my mind is “where tf is ter Stegan” 💀😂🤡😂
Memphis-depencia😂🔥....jk but great start by Memphis. Bilboa will always give Barca a difficult game.
Depay is definitely worth every bill
Woah….Depay….lookin like he out to prove haters wrong….
Funny how when Valverde made the same tackle as Eric he was praised, but when someone from Barcelona does it, he gets hate? You love to see it from haters 😂 cry
The obsolete van lastly recognise because banker contrarily spell abaft a callous puppy. enthusiastic, lowly fork
Boring game
Man i wish messi could play with depay. Depay would easily hit 20 goals
The organic vest karunagappally book because plow respectively shiver concerning a utter outrigger. unusual, extra-large extra-small exuberant rake
Just goes to show u Messi was never shadowing anybody lol
who ate Depay! that’s not a 3 * weak foot… take note EA!!
Yall were way to overconfident with the We dont need Messi thing
The receptive foundation unknowingly employ because banjo regrettably trade along a swanky trousers. testy, black-and-white numeric
4:09 👏👏
What is this new running joke about Braithwaite being a goat, this kid has school shoes on and isn't even up at the top yet in terms of IQ and accomplishments.  Has jagged more goals than anything!  He reminds me of Chicharito, way overhyped. with bare minimum skill.  Only there to cherry pick, doesn't create anything except wide open goal misses.
That Gk garbage
Goatwaithe with the world class finishing yet again 🔥🔥🔥
You know your team is Screwed when Braithwaite is the striker
Did Griezmann played in this match?
Barcelona going suffer
When fati and dembele and coutinho is back will be alright. I want minguesa and arajo, in the back.  We need pig in the minefield to put some spice on it
Barca going to have tough season especially because they are struggling against middle table teams.
That dejong save tho
You all has to learn how to pronounce the Spanish last names , be professionals… you are working in ESPN
this game could easily have been 2,3,4 for athletic. barca should be doing better.
Williams was amazing
Barcelona is a shell of its former self
neto definetly did not deserve a clean sheet too many mistakes
Eric Garcia has never been a good defender lol
Why didn’t they show the perfectly legal bicycle kick goal by Araujo wiped out by the referee’s stupidity?
Araujo goal should have stood
Is no one going to talk about araujo’s disallowed goal?
No messi no Barca
U could notice messi's absence
Boring without Messi!!
Imma have to get myself a Depay shirt eventually if he stays at this level or goes higher
OK honestly, where the f was griezmann this game? Completely missing!
De Jong is the Flying Dutchman of 2021
Eric Garcia had a horrible day at the office today
First time in 20 years Barcelona without Rivaldo or Ronaldinho or Messi ,they are now Orphanola.
This Barcelona Team is really unrecognizable..
Garcia wasn't as bad as some make it seem, Iñaki would've scored 2 goals if he wasn't there. Demir looked uncomfortable, as did Emerson. Depay and De Jong were the best thing about Barca today, Araujo's goal should've counted, Braithwaite should've finished off an easy goal.
To whomever is in charge of these titles - please stop telling us how the game ends. Thanks.
Depay= 🔥 De Jong=  🎩 🪄 griezmann= 🗑 🤢
eric my boy for a central defender you need to hit the weight room bro. we can't have you flip floppin like that until the end of the season
Would have won if brathwaite didn’t screw up the first chance!
Garcia was so bad today he couldn't even draw contact on his red card.  He got the red card as mercy... The red was like... Just go home and start over tomorrow. Lol
Brathwaithe is just… yikes…
Interesting game
opportunity barca missing today, will count tomorrow to make difference and win title. be careful
Not sure how much contact??? He’s running full Speed. Any touch is gonna make him fall lol
No idiot… the goal keeper isn’t saving that lol… no goalkeeper is
Barca should’ve honestly lost like 4-1…
Im a madrid fan but ya defense is bad ...depay has shown more then griezman in so little time too smh
Barca salvation is here The new ronaldinho Jeremy doku more cheaper that mbappe and much better  Doku-(haaland)-ansufati or griezmann 🔥 🔥 🔥
Barca in mid season form
Barca throwing the title already 🤣🤣 trash
Eric Gracia is a bad bad defender my goodness
anyone else think these commentators are trash?
the declining of Barcelona has begun.
What about Neto? This dude is SLOW
Just last week after the very first game against real sociedad the headline was --> Barca players make statement after messi departure.   Halftime, the commentators were saying "Messi who" when barca was up 3-0.  Here we are, week 2, Bilbao doing the tiki taka on barca. Barca needing individual heroics to tie game. Their best player was a holding midfielder for 'defending' and zoning well.  Messi who? 6 time ballon d'or that was sabotaged by his own club.   Cant wait to see the next clickbait statement by espn.
Pie has done more in two matches that F Grizeshit has done in one season.
No messi no party.
Delay better get a 4 ⭐️ WF in fut 22 lol 😂
Barca needed messi out tbh. They’re game revolved over a slowed down messi. And they were going backwards… good decision. Both will prosper. Messi and Barca
Delay looking great. Let’s pray for a healthy coutinho cuz man that combo could be crazy with the rest of the guys. Just need Roberto out of there ASAP n pique.. Frenkies tackle in first half was nuts, Kante level stuff frfr. Eric Garcia’s last min tackle saved the game no doubt, great kid
Memphis is trash his playing style is so standard...
Barca goal keeper reaction is absolutely trassh
La que se perdio braithnaldo 😭
Omg that defense is so bad 😞
I’ve never seen a game in which field players saved as much goals as Barcelona players 😂
Goatwaite gotta score those wide open sitters man
There have been so many times Messi has got Barcelona out of trouble and they will soon realize that without him, there will be a lot of draws that used to be wins and a lot of losses that used to be draws. Second game in and were' already seeing  what a toothless bunch this manager and his Barcelona team are without Messi and Suarez.   Griezman is a waste of time and money.
Real Madrid is way better
So Real Madrid will have a field day! Wow! Hope they cap it 5 at least
They dont call him Goatwaite in vain, what a miss!
Barca is doomed in the champions league
De jong’s defensive awareness and execution is world class in stopping that goal
Erik Garcia is not a solid CB he’s more built like a CM or CDM
No Messi no party 🤪
Can't believe Braithwaite wasted that chance.
The Barca defense looking like butter they way they get cut through but Depay and de jong give me hope for the club
De jong, and Memphis are honestly the only good people we have atm. Sad how we went from the best team of the century to this. I knew nothing good lasts but I never thought we’d get here. This is just sad.
Goat braithway is better than Messi+ Ronaldo! 🤦‍♂️
So i wonder what happened with the we can win without Messi 😂😂
This the new era of barça? Pathetic. I hope PSG clashes to Barça in Champions league.
Y no estaba off side???
Ya PINCHARON 😀😀😀😀😀😀
0:10 you gotta score from there.  Great set play by barca 3:50   But the barca defense needs to do better there especially with speed 5:30
Barca struggling! They’re starting to look like Manchester United, full of young players with less experience. It’s gonna take many year for Barca to recover.
eric garcia is so trash,  barca got scammed not to mention he's all hype
I’ll never understand how Eric Garcia keeps failing upwards. The guy is awful but they still play him
Memphis gonna carry barca
No Messi to carry Barca up today
Barcelona’s defense is pure trash
Easily could've been a 4 goal victory for Athletic.  This is going to be a LOOOOOOONG season for Barca.
No Messi, no win
The main problem for Bilbao I think was the goalie committed some mistakes first he didn’t try to stop the ball harder, since it went through his fingers
The commentary was so unenthusiatic when depay scored that crazy goal😂
Same old defense, they’re gonna struggle all season again
Why didn’t they SUB in Messi 😤😤😤😡😡
Great to see Depay doing well. Hopefully this continues.
Memphis came in at the right time, his performances won't be overshadowed by Messi, unlike so many others that came before him.
This goal keeper is dumb a$$$$$$$!!!! C’ on man!!!!
My god the desperation of barca's defense lol they should've tried to sign more defense
Get neto tf outa goal
nobady is talking how ronald araujo saved Barca 2 times
i’m a Barca fan but idk what yall saw today… in the first half Bilbao could of made 5 goals and in the 2nd half about 3/4 more.. the team played trash in all positions.. there’s ALOT more work to do ALOT more. there’s pieces missing. this year don’t know but in 2 more years we’ll have a solid team for sure.. but rn its just all over the place
I seriously don't like koeman as a coach, he plays pique after coming from an injury and wasn't fully recovered and then Eric Garcia when he just found out his granddad died, i seriously don't understand it . I think lenglet and Araujo  would've been a better option
Braithwaite c'mon bro i am a Barca supporter.
:30 as a keeper it really pisses me off when a defender tells me to come and collect the ball in those situations, like just clear it, plus the defender shields the ball super late
seemed like individually the players did well, de jong was class, memphis was class. eric garcia struggled but it wasn’t his fault, red card was a great sacrifice for the team
00:11 Braithwaite reaching his normal level just at the second game 🤣
Give Depay number 10
Barca won't make top 4 this season
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH BARCELONA DEFENSE??? KOEMAN NEEDS OUT OR BARCELONA WILL NEVER WIN GAMES AND LOSE THE BALL IN THE BACK
Safe to say not a single la liga team will win a champions league for the next couple years
If you guys think you have a competitive team you are drunk or too optimistic. If you finish fifth that's just what you are good for.
Barcelona is just another Lyon now and surely they will have a rough domestic.forget the Champions league🤣😂🤣
Woww Depay.
Depay drop a 🚀
4:36 "Can the goalie do better?!" LOL, the commentator better be joking here or obviously he has never played before. That goalie only HEARD that ball fly by him .... It is humanly impossible to react quickly enough to a nuclear weapon like that.
Nobody finna talk about the Barca gk not knowing what to do when running out of the box like he ain’t even getting the ball multiple times
Braithwaite had one good match & returned to his form from last season, missing sitters my grandmum could put away
I hate to see Barca struggling. We used to be the best team in the world and now we’re struggling to beat teams like this. Fair play to Bilbao, fantastic game from them, but Barca played terrible. I hope we can rebuild and come back even stronger but it’s sad to see such an amazing club collapse in front of you. It truly is an end of an era.
Why is Martin still playing
1:20 What a tackle
The player long time ago in Manchester United play very bad this player now main player for Barcelona 😹lmfao Barcelona this is your rating,this is who are you right now,you never ever win title again mark my wordy
No more tiki taka😂
What a waste of money is Griezman! He is not Barcelona caliber player, never will be.
No pique and no Eric Garcia for next match I guess we'll see umtiti's greatness next week
Eric's red card was beautifully done. 1-1 in the 92nd minute, so earning a red card for the team showed class! not the best performance from him this match but nonetheless, great call in the final minutes.
Imagine if Messi actually stayed and this man depay playing so good
why tf is greizman still in barca lmfao litteraly contributes nothing to the team
Depay & De Jong are carrying this team.
It’s a longggg season for Barca. Unfortunately, Depay can’t play like that everyday. Today, again, they showed their same weakness.
Depay! 😍😍🥵🔥
De jong with that block was just perfect.
Memphis the next iniesta
Don't bash barca, with messi on the pitch they lost a title
Dest is very promising. It's nice having a full back that can carve through defense.
Mi abuela de 60 años juega mejor que el portero del Barcelona Dioss esperó que ter Stegen vuelva pronto si no van a sufrir los próximos partidos
Anyone know what happened to ter stegen ?
Griezmann what a shame. This is his chance. No way he can lead this team. All Memphis. Get rid of GM
It sucks to be poor, sucks even more having braithwaithe as starter
Barcelona doesn’t deserve Depay
Eric Garcia pulled a Valverde, only it wasn't a good counter because he unnecessarily provoked it
I still don’t know how Braithwaite missed that first chance.. 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
barca need aguero right about now
If someone had time traveled from that June of 2015 after Barca won everything possible, to now they would actually think this was an alternative timeline where none of this would ever happen
Iñaki destroyed Eric all game and the red card was welcome to stop the pain at the end.
I see Barcelona 5th at the end of the season.
Without Messi it just feels like i am watching some random la liga team
Athletic Bilbao always a tricky to beat.
Is de gea injured or sum ?
Barcelona played like an average team
A good first goal for Depay. However I was disappointed with the red card but if Eric didn't tackled him then Williams would have scored so he pulled off a Valverde move (slide against Morata).
The coach sucks , the team sucks , Griezmann sucks ....as for Memphis deepay , we all know him , you’ll soon see him being who he is ,an average football player who sucks too !!!
Memphis Depay and De Jong carrying
They should've won Braithwaite missed wide open smh
Net was making decisions like a drunk. He's really bad
We will be lucky if we finish top 4 and qualify for champions league
Bilbao is always a though team to beat, specially as locals.
It very easily could’ve been Athletic 3-1 Barcelona
Depay is good but I don't see him win anything yet
should have subbed messi in
Chris brown man that missed goal!!!
Horrible performance by Neto. Defence was decent but you can tell that the formation and idea of play isn't working.
The good news is there’s still room for improvement on Barca part. The bad news is braithwaite, pique, and griezmann still need be let go off.
I hate and love my team. We might not rise today. But one day we will rise and concour. It will be a tough few months and years like the past. One day.
Barca will be good enough to not lose a lot of games but I have a feeling they will end with more draws than wins .
Commentators straight trash
Barca’s defense is Trash!!! Braith is trash as well
Williams is 10 times better than braithwaite they should have bought him instead.
HAHAHAHA AND THE DOWNFALL BEGINSS
@00:11 😂😂😂
Memphis was a golazoo I can’t believed he didn’t sing that goal!
Definitely are missing Ter Stegen, Neto with a lot of mistakes
If only Braithwaite scored that tap in🤦‍♂️
Only if depay and messi was in our attack
I know it’s the beginning of a new era for Barca but I don’t see this squad winning anything for at least a couple years. Even then we would have to see. Both Madrid teams look way more solid.
Depay is one those players that be afraid 😳.
Bring back ter stegen, that goalkeeper is a joke
Lackluster performance from FC Barcelona
Told you all barcelona is not any better without leo
Memphis solo carrying the offense just like how it was with Messi last year.  New players, same old play style.
Depay's goal was an absolute screamer. Keeper maybe could have done better, but that shot was THOOMIN'.
I can't be talking as an Arsenal fan but Depay is one of the missing pieces that Barca needed. If Messi stayed at Barca which wasn't Barcelonas fault that Messi left. Depay, Aguero, and Messi would be deadly.
Memphis may have got the point but De Jong saved the day
Depay, De Jong, and Araujo were fantastic. But Garcia was terrible, dud was getting skinned against Williams the whole game, and he was the one marking Martinez who scored, and made a mistake that led to the red card.
bro braithwaite what happened
Messi woulve made it 2-1
Why isnt ter stegen playing
I didn't realize inaki had a blistering paced brother lol
Same exact header than last year against Athletico de Madrid.Nice game for Bilbao
Depay on fire 🔥
You get Memphis on that left side run he will score all the time. 💯
barca finna finish 5th watch 😂

I hate that title lol. This game was all about Bilbao dominating Barca, I don't get why the title focuses on Depay. Yes he saved the point, but give credit to the dominant team here.
Barca goalkeeper need more work
What a fking saved 1:40 🔥
I was starting to respect Brathewaite but that miss was shocking
Do you think Barca will win the league this season? Btw I can’t wait to see Fati back on the field, we miss him a lot!
It's only gonna get uglier from now on!
Garcia, what a signing 🔥🔥🔥😂
Ter stegen is really missed when we play teams like these
kind of still optimistic as a barca fan.  we have a few big injuries still- ter stegen, dembele, coutinho, and fati
Pep content after sending Garcia to Barca
this is the Barca we expected to see without Messi
This audio desync is really annoying
I’m not anybody to be talking but Barca looks like there’s a lack of communication and form. I think they’re talented even without Messi, but I think they’d be lucky to finish top 5 if they played in the premier league, that’s a big fall.
really poor game from eric garcia...
Thank you De jong, Arauro, Deprays Braistwayte and Greinsman can do better. Eric Garcia should’ve not play today! Sergio Busquets is very poor for this team.
Jodi alba needs competition he was terrible
Eric Garcia shouldn’t have played in that mental state. His Granddad died and was told moments before the game started. Hearts out to him and his family 🙏🏽❤️
Grezman is useless
Neto is just a pole
Brathwaite was talking all big … then misses a complete open goal . Unmarked.
ESPN TRASH GIVE LA LIGA BACK YO BEIN SPORT
wHAT IS Up  bARCA FIGHTING FOR YOUR LIFE without Messi! Good luck!
If De Jong put the volley in it would have been so spectacular!
I’m a Barcelona fan if anybody thinks Barca will win any trophy your delusional
Here we go! The Messi effect starts now
English narrators are SOOOO BORING!!!!
The reason Goatwaithe miss was to show mercy to Bilbao !!!!!!
Why the heck ESPN give the game away in their titles. @espn some of us miss the game and would love to watch it without your freaking spoilers. Dang!
our defense is getting better barcelona lets goooooo
Thanks Eric for saving FCB today. That red card saved us. Also the guy lose his granpa and still played a descent game. But, Koeman sucks for letting him start with that in mind.
Goal taken away from Araújo / Barca for no particular reason. The ref waits 10 seconds and then, after the ball goes in the net, blows the whistle. Replay shows no foul.
tbf Barca almost always struggles against Athletic Bilbao. Maybe they should play the nerds of Academic Bilbao instead.
Bruh cmon 🤦‍♂️
“Where is Messi?” One of my empty headed thoughts 😑
Depay is playing really great so far i like what im seeing. We shouldnt be making these mistakes Braithwaite is making.
Good for Memphis but his not Messi and cannot do this every game n save every game
Eric verdadero  defensa de corazón  lo demuestra al equipo
Did dest play well for anyone who saw the hole game
Barcelona are finished hahaha
What is Braithwaite doing at barca at this point
Good job depay! We need heroes right now for Barcelona
That coverage from De Jong was world class. 1:08  Also, isn’t it crazy that after that goal saving tackle NOBODY congratulated him?
Barca look like such an average team now lol
Where are the Barca play better without Messi crowd? They looked bad.
Funny how all the Barca fans are saying Erics foul was a good choice yet bashed Fede for the exact same kind of foul against Atletico 🤡
Braithwaitedihno strikes again
Messi who 😂😂😂😂😂!
One of those away games where we struggled for 70 mins and the credit goes to Bilbio's pressing. Superb performance by De Jong and Memphis, and that goal was sensational. Goal saving blocks by De Jong and Arauho saved us but on the other hand, we missed some golden opportunities, notably by Braithwaite and Memphis. Koeman should have done some more during the half and could not understand his Demir substitution (Reminds me of his love for Trincoa) but I am happy with a point. Go Barca.
Araujo is sooo slept on
Barca is in need of a center back and winger sell dembele
Frankie saved it from it being 2-1👏
Lol they don’t need Messi ? Lol 😂
Bilbao can make top 4  struggle but when playing a against regelation team 😂
La Liga is either getting harder and more competitive or Barcelona is becoming an average team.
What kind of Barca is that?
Bein sports highlights so much better
Please don't do the virtual pans like that, where it isn't a real camera. The tech isn't quite there and it's slightly sickening because it looks wrong.
I’m just here for the trolls
I’m glad they kept the lord Braithwaite 😂😂😂
Depay has been impressive so far.
Depay is in good form would’ve been good to see next to Messi and our defense is still struggling too much imagine what a good offensive team will do to us!!
Now I can see our new Best player is Memphis Depay
williams is pretty good i’m surprised a big club hasn’t signed him yet
A bad day for everyone except that Barca midfield
Next game it will be Mingueza and Araujo in defense
Awful commentating, disgrace to all the action in this game
predi is bad yall pedri lovers are crazy. What does Koeman see in him???  he can't distribute the ball fluidly and when does pass the ball it's always backwards with multiple options that were favourable. He needs to be aggressive playing that position like De jong is. THANK GOD he's going on vacation to open Koeman's eyes.  What happened to Dest? he can't get past defenders even his life depended on it. IF Koeman thought he was going to be a Dani Alves he's mistaken and delusional. pique and Araujo had to cover for his mismarks and mistakes most of the game. He should not be in the starting 11 Emerson is a better player than dest.  Eric Garcia got exposed today lol he did an okay job against Sociedad but today he proved he lacks speed and game sense.  NETO...........  When Sergio Roberto got in it was a completely different game. IDK why Koeman doesn't start him. In both games he was subbed in he changed the tempo of the game and woke the attackers. WE NEED HIM TO START.
where’s ter stegen?
Great game for De Jong and Depay, miserable game from Garcia
Respect for Garcia reminds me of valverde takel against morata
El camino el largo pero esta todo mal desde el inicio suerte barca .👍👍👍👍👍👍
Lo unico q puedo decir q. El barcelona eata ahorita muy deprimidos necesitan como a messy y depay q bueno ubiese sido verlos jugar juntos ese tipo se ve q le pone ganas
Eric Garcia is complete trash. No wonder city let him go.
Eric Garcia did horrible this game. I get he’s a new player but still
ESPN weee scared barca almost lost
baring PSG we can almost guarantee another all English final this year in the Champions League. The English teams seem so much better than other big european teams now.
Depay sad he never met Messi lmfao, he was probably the only one besides Agüero to actually do something with him in the field 😂😂😂
Barcelona deserved to lose tbh, the defensive woes go from bad to worse
Barcelonas true colors were exposed today
Barcelona is in desperate need for a CB… my god what does the board need to see to invest in a quality defender?! Eric looks like the Spanish Phil Jones
LOL!
Real Madrid will say what bad thing García did but Valverde got player of the year against atlético what he did to morata so García knew what he was doing risked it
If brathewaite wants a position in this team he has to put that chance away
From R9 back to Braithwaite again.
These commentators suck. Ray hudson wouldve gone crazy
Eric did the right thing at the end, he saved the team
Erick safe Barcelona to 2-1
Dont miss messi now mfs you let him go now in Champions L barca going to get tthe shiy the they put messi on and he'll destroy barça mark my word
No Messi no party Lol
I can’t wait for Ansu and dembele to come back. If Ansu can comeback strong he will no doubt score more than Braithwaite and if Dembele can stay consistent his pace trickery and two two footedness will provide much more than Griezmann. Also why is Griezmann not getting the same treatment as Moriba. His wages are ridiculous and he can’t even outshine Braithwaite for god sake!
If anyone on that Barca team is going to at least a fill a fraction of Messi's boots, it's Depay
When goatwaite misses an open goal lmao
De Jong shows once again how clear he is of Valverde, just stop with that horrible comparison
People in the comment section acting like we never struggled playing Athletic Away.  All the big teams always struggle in this fixture.
can someone tell me why araujo’s goal was disallowed or was nobody watching the game?😂
No Messi no party
ESPN showed MLS soccer instead of this game on TV. They didn’t even show it on ABC. Instead they showed little league baseball- yes, little kids playing baseball instead of one of the biggest soccer leagues in the world. Embarrassing and disappointing as always from ESPN. La Liga was much better on Bein Sports in every aspect.
Neto was a disaster
one miserable goal for the bankrupt team!!
cmon braithwate this is what cost us last season 0:10
barca was dirty again at the end
Memphis is gonna need some help
The downfall of varca begins
0:16 looooooooooord braithwaite strikes again
If only Messi, and depay could play at least one game
Varca were soooo lucky in this game 😂😭 Bilbao should have at least scored 4
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Eric Garcia had a nightmare of a game my lord
barca need to sell griezman braithwaite alba etc griezman was never a world class player but his fan boys give him all the credit for atletico team work success that came from scoring 1 or 2 goals and parked the bus and griezman fan boys also give him all the credit for france world cup when france best attacking players were mbappe and pogba
Messi disappeared as usual
Great goal line clearence by of Arajuo
A big around of applause for Memphis
Ngl idk who gunna buy neto that dude is sorry
We can’t handle high press teams, this game showed more of that.
How the F you missed that goal
At least Barca didn't lose
Garcia isn't that bad of a player, even though he picked up a red at the end of the game. Really good tactical foul on his part.
