I heard, as far as the money situation goes, things can get real shady in the music industry. If there is anyone out there, who thinks these trap artists are making tons of money, then you are a fool, real talent get money, all these no talent trap artists need to get the hell on!!!
Future verse from hard to choose one would be 🔥

Polo G beat 🎸💯💥 https://youtu.be/yKHz95phQbk
sonzera fi :v
The video diminishes the gravity of the lyrics because they are obviously acting in the video. It could just be me and my opinion, but a music video should show the proof of what is being rapped or sung about.
The Top 6 Greatest Rappers In My Opinion: 1. Lil Wayne 2. Lil Durk 3. NLE Choppa  4. Juice WRLD 5. 2Pac  6. Polo G
My two favorite artists making a collab is wild
Wonder if he got the 100% completition at the of the heist
Salutz

Polo and nle u can’t stop that duo they are the best music duo ever
nle eyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Bryson working his ass off oh my bad excuse me (NLE CHOPPA) not only does he seem to have a spiritual side, a business mind, and a side that you don't wanna cross him to even witness it  plus my boy just move completely different than most rappers. Almost every song he did for this project has a video I mean he just released two projects in 2020 and now one already in 2022 dudes out there grinding and killing most of your favorite rappers. Had to make this rant for all the haters who were saying oh CHOPPA went soft NLEs new music is trash because he's not talking about shooting up your mom's house or posted off Camelot with the strap and the many other things that young black, Hispanic, and any immigrant have to do to survive the system is corrupt their killing the black community any chance they get and who is they the rich white elite . My point is I'm proud of NLE CHOPPA for expressing himself with out caring what was said because he was on his own expressionism and instead of making a drill / gangshit type of project he made a positive deep intellectual project that blew my mind ps.this song is slappin
This is nice
Gta6

Let me know I will really appreciate it 👍  President Joe Biden administration why we need emergency coronavirus covid-19 stimulus package 📦🤔 at least 2 checks of $2000 💵 out of the coming new year 🎉 2022  WORLD Omicron variant now in North America, Canadian officials say Two cases of the newly identified coronavirus variant found in Africa and Europe have been detected in Ontario.  Canadian officials announced Sunday that the omicron variant of the coronavirus has reached North America, with two cases appearing in Ontario.  Top Ontario health officials Christine Elliott and Kieran Moore said in a joint statement that two people who had recently been in Nigeria have tested positive for the variant.  Contact tracing was being conducted to determine whether others in the country might be positive.  The health officials said their strategy is to stop as many omicron cases as possible from entering Canada.  "We continue to urge the federal government to take the necessary steps to mandate point-of-arrival testing for all travellers irrespective of where they’re coming from to further protect against the spread of this new variant," the pair said.  Ontario has focused rapid Covid-19 testing on travelers who have been to South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe, the statement said.  Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Saturday on NBC’s “Weekend TODAY” that the variant could already be in the U.S.  "We have not detected it yet, but when you have a virus that is showing this degree of transmissibility and you’re already having travel-related cases that they’ve been noted in Israel and Belgium and in other places — when you have a virus like this, it almost invariably is ultimately going to go essentially all over," he said.  Recommended  U.S. NEWS Merriam-Webster chooses vaccine as the 2021 word of the year Fauci explained why the variant has inspired global caution: Its apparent mutations indicate that it may be highly transmissible and able to escape the body’s immune response, as well as some protection rendered by vaccines.  "You don’t want to frighten the American public, but when something occurs that you need to take seriously, you take it seriously, and you do whatever you can to mitigate against that," he said.   Fauci, who met Sunday with President Joe Biden, said existing vaccines are likely to provide "a degree" of protection against severe cases of Covid-19, the White House said in a readout that paraphrased his remarks.  Fauci also reiterated that getting booster shots provides additional protection, the White House said.  Biden was expected to provide an update Monday about the U.S. response to the variant. Sunday afternoon’s readout did not mention the Ontario discovery.  The spread of the omicron variant prompted Israel to close its borders to travelers Saturday, with some exceptions.

OG GRAPE
😎
Did I just see jack black
Why did the crowds shout, “Crucify Him!”  I'm a believer I know how this World 🌎 feels about me ? I'm Good 👏 I always say it's not me they hating 🤔 it's who is in Me ⁉️ ◄ Matthew 12:14 ► But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.  My Words 🤔 can you imagine  individuals back in the day of Jesus ⁉️ let's take out the LORD Jesus ⁉️ put him on the obituary paper 📜 list⁉️ ( wait a minute that's 2021) Could you imagine that Packed Funeral ⚰️ and seeing Jesus in a Coffin⁉️ Then the Funeral Director closest the Casket ⁉️ now we off to the Burial and tombstone saying here lies Jesus Christ ( Birth Year and Death year ⁉️  ◄ John 11:53 ► So from that day on they planned together to kill Him ( Jesus Christ).  Why did the crowds shout, “Crucify Him!” when Pilate wanted to release Jesus? Crucify Him ANSWER  When the Sanhedrin brought Jesus before the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, Pilate could not find any fault in Jesus, and he said so three times (Luke 23:4, 14–15, 22). Late in the trial, Pilate sought a way to free Jesus (John 19:12). It was a Passover festival custom that the governor release a prisoner to the people, so, in a ploy to appease the crowd of Jewish leaders who had gathered and to secure Jesus’ release, Pilate allowed them to choose between a convicted criminal named Barabbas and Jesus. Instead of choosing Jesus, as Pilate had hoped, the crowd chose Barabbas for release. Shocked that they would free a hardened criminal, Pilate asked, “What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?” (Mark 15:12). The crowd cried out, “Crucify him!” (verse 13).  It is well that Pilate was confused by the crowd’s reaction, for barely a week earlier the people of Jerusalem had welcomed Jesus into the city with the waving of palm branches and shouts of “Hosanna!” (Matthew 21:1–11). What Pilate may not have known was the extent to which the religious and political leaders hated and opposed Jesus. Over the course of Jesus’ ministry, His teachings had alienated and angered the Pharisees, the scribes, the Herodians, and the Sadducees. Not only did Jesus point out their extreme hypocrisy on many occasions (see Matthew 23; Mark 7:1–14; Luke 20:45–47), but He also claimed to be God, which was blasphemy to the unbelieving teachers of the law (see Mark 14:60–64). The religious leaders wanted to utterly destroy Jesus (Matthew 12:14; Mark 3:6). Only His death would satisfy them.  In Jesus’ time, crucifixion was reserved for the worst of criminals. The torture a person endured on a cross would last for hours, and killing Jesus in this manner likely appealed to the religious leaders who hated Him so deeply. In an effort to hide their move against Jesus from His many supporters, the Jewish leaders arrested and tried Jesus in the middle of the night. When Jesus was brought before Pontius Pilate—the only one with authority to order a crucifixion—it was still early in the morning (Matthew 27:1–2). When Pilate presented Jesus and Barabbas to the people, the chief priests whipped the crowd into a frenzy, encouraging them to call for Barabbas’s release (Mark 15:11). When Pilate asked what they wanted done to Jesus, the crowd, again influenced by the chief priests, shouted, “Crucify Him!” Pilate, the people-pleaser, gave them what they demanded. He had Jesus flogged and then turned Him over for crucifixion.  At the beginning of the week, there was a crowd in Jerusalem celebrating Jesus as the Messiah; by Friday, there was a crowd crying, “Crucify Him!” The striking change of the city’s heart naturally causes some perplexity. It’s good to remember that not everyone at the Triumphal Entry was celebrating the Lord. Most of the city was puzzled: “When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, ‘Who is this?’” (Matthew 21:10), and the Jewish leaders were indignant (verse 15). Some of the same crowd who shouted, “Hosanna!” may also have been part of the crowd shouting “Crucify Him!” but we can’t be sure. If some people did join both crowds, it may be because they had grown disillusioned with Jesus when they discovered He was not going to set up the kingdom immediately—or perhaps they disliked Jesus’ insistence that they repent. Also, it’s quite possible that the crowd gathered before Pilate at that early hour had been assembled and suborned by the Jewish leaders.  In the end, it wasn’t the crowd’s cries of “Crucify Him!” that put Jesus on the cross. Our sin did that. From the very beginning, when Adam and Eve disobeyed God, the Lord had promised to send a Savior who would crush the reign of sin and death (Genesis 3:15). Throughout the ages God wove His plan to send a Savior, and that plan culminated in the person of Jesus Christ: God’s own Son who became the perfect God-man so He could take upon Himself the punishment for sin. Although wicked men were involved in Jesus’ death on the cross, His sacrifice was ultimately the will of God (Isaiah 53:10; John 10:18). The shedding of Jesus’ blood fulfilled God’s promise to mankind to provide a Savior and sealed the New Covenant (Luke 22:20). Jesus would then defeat the power of death and the grave by rising again three days later and ascending to His Father’s right hand in heaven.  My Words 🤔 Stop 🛑 Thinking people are fearing Death 💀 They looking for it 🤔 A Medium person who talks to the dead :; says people shouldn't be afraid of " Death 💀 Dying ( you go to the Spirit world 🌏 I'm not looking for that 😞 I'm going to Heaven and hang out with Jesus and live in His Kingdom 👑 like the thief on the cross!

The Satanic Trinity 🤔 Understand being deceived n  false prophets Why is Satan Going to be released after the 1000 years? God release Satan  We all have free will 🤔 Why does God allow deception?  God’s desire is that all people repent and be saved (2 Peter 3:9). At the same time, Satan, the “father of lies” (John 8:44), deceives the very people who need to accept the truth. “The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ” (2 Corinthians 4:4). Surely, God could stop Satan’s lies and give people a fighting chance.  The Bible presents a consistent picture of how sin and deception are related. What’s revealed is that the way we tend to think of deceit is, well, a bit deceived. Spiritually speaking, deception is deeper than merely being tricked or lied to. In order to be saved, one does not need any particular level of intelligence, philosophical ability, or wisdom (Galatians 3:28; 1 Corinthians 1:20, 26). In fact, mankind has an unfortunate habit of using increased knowledge to develop more sophisticated ways to sin.  Key to understanding spiritual deception is the fact that we often choose what we want to believe rather than what we should believe, even in the face of the evidence (Luke 16:31). “Even after Jesus had done all these miraculous signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him” (John 12:37). Notice that they would not believe Jesus, despite the miracles. Their unbelief was willful.  Eve’s fall into sin is the earliest example of how spiritual deception works. When the serpent asks her, “Did God really say . . . ?” Eve responds by quoting what God had said, although she added to the command (Genesis 3:1–3). She knows what to do and what not to do. The serpent then tempts her with what she can gain by eating from the tree (Genesis 3:4–5), and she notices other attractive aspects of the fruit (Genesis 3:6). Eve was lied to, and the serpent was cunning (2 Corinthians 11:3), but she ultimately chose to disobey God, even though she knew the commandment.  When confronted with her sin, Eve said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate” (Genesis 3:13). The original Hebrew word for “deceived” implies trickery and craftiness. Eve was tricked, but she also had a choice in the matter. She exercised her God-given free will to make a wrong choice, seeking pleasure and personal promotion over what God had willed for her.  The same dynamic is at work today. Satan appeals to our natural desires and urges us to fulfill them in ways that dishonor God. Our desire for self-satisfaction makes Satan’s deception all the more potent.  God has sent the Savior (John 3:16), He fills the world with signs of Himself (Romans 1:20), He makes Himself available to those who seek Him (Deuteronomy 4:29), and He secures anyone who comes to Him (John 6:37). When people reject what is “clearly seen” of God (Romans 1:20), it leads to a downward spiral of “foolish hearts” made dark (verse 21), idolatry (verse 23), and sexual impurity (verse 24). Finally, mankind “exchanged the truth of God for a lie” (verse 25). In other words, the spiritual deception of mankind is the direct result of rejecting readily apparent truth. The unbeliever has made an exchange—the truth for a lie—and the devil is happy to facilitate the swap by presenting the sinner with a wide array of lies from which to choose.  Anyone who resists God risks falling into spiritual deception (2 Thessalonians 2:8–10). Nature abhors a vacuum, and the void created by the eviction of truth will soon be filled by something less than true. Give up the truth, and you’ll believe just about anything.  Eve didn’t sin because she was hopelessly outmatched by a demonic force, making her do wrong when she thought she was doing right. Yes, she was lied to, but she chose to listen to the lie. That was followed by her longing look at what was forbidden and, finally, her taking the fruit in hopes of a better life.  All human sin is based in human choice (1 Corinthians 10:13). When we reject the truth, we make ourselves vulnerable to the lie. Repeated rejection of spiritual truth brings spiritual deception as a divine consequence.  God often allows spiritual deception as a form of punishment for willful sin, and in order to cultivate an awareness in our lives of how badly we need the One who is Himself Truth, our Lord Jesus Christ (John 14:6).  ◄ Revelation 13:8 ► All inhabitants of the earth 🌎 will worship the beast—all whose names have not been written in the Lamb’s book of life, the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world.  ◄ Revelation 13:14 ►  And deceiveth them ( male's and Female's) that dwell on the planet Earth 🌎 by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.  Why is God going to release Satan after the 1000 years? God release Satan  ANSWER  Revelation 20:7-10, “When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth—Gog and Magog—to gather them for battle. In number they are like the sand on the seashore. They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God’s people, the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and devoured them. And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.”  As we read these verses, we wonder, “Why will God release Satan at the end of the Millennial Reign of Jesus Christ?” First, we must admit that there are some biblical questions which we cannot answer this side of glory because God has chosen to reserve some mysteries to Himself (Deuteronomy 29:29, Romans 11:33-36). Yet, as believers, even if we cannot always understand something about God’s Word, His will, or His ways, we can be sure that He remains ever faithful, true, and trustworthy, and in light of that our job remains to obey what we do understand as quickly, fully, and well as we are able. Even if we might not be able to answer why God releases Satan, we can suggest some possible reasons and motivations, based on an understanding of the entirety of the Word of God.  At the beginning of the Millennium, only believers will be alive (Revelation 19:17-21), some who live through the Tribulation Period, and some who come back with the Lord at His second coming. It will be a time of peace unparalleled in history (Isaiah 2:4; Micah 4:3). Jesus will be ruling on the throne of David, imposing a benevolent theocracy on all of His creation. Jesus will ensure that everyone has every need fulfilled, while not tolerating the sin so prevalent in today’s society (Psalm 2:7-12; Revelation 2:26-29; 12:5; 19:11-16). We can only imagine such a time of “heaven on earth."  The believers who live through the Tribulation will be mortal. They will live and repopulate the earth during the Millennial Kingdom. Without the devastation of sin taking its toll, we can imagine the population increase during the Millennium will be enormous, almost incomprehensible. All those who are born during the Millennium will enjoy the benefits and blessings of Christ’s reign on the earth, but they will still be born with a sin nature, and they will still have to freely repent and believe the Gospel, personally choosing Christ as Savior and Lord.  Yet, at the end of the Millennial Reign, Satan is loosed and is able to deceive a vast multitude to follow him in one final rebellion against the Lord of glory and His saints! It seems that the further humanity gets from the end of the Tribulation and the start of the Millennium, the more they will "take for granted" how good they have it, and some may even harbor doubts about the goodness of God. Even though the number who rebel with Satan are said to be "as the sand of the sea" (Revelation 20:7), they may still be a minority compared to the number who do not rebel. It will still be a large number of souls who join Satan. Undoubtedly, one of the primary reasons God gives us this picture of what will happen in time is to demonstrate the deep-seated sin nature inherent in all of humanity (Jeremiah 17:9).  ◄ Revelation 9:21 ► Nor did they repent of their murders, their magic arts, their sexual immorality or their thefts.  ◄ Genesis 8:22 ► "As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will never cease."  My Words 🤔 I lived long enough to say it's not only about the American Dream 💵💰 and Surviving 365 days of a Year 🎈🎉 20_ _ Nothing wrong with that! But this life comes with a life expectancy 🤔 and unfortunately it's normally under 💯 years and you gotta do something about while you alive on a Temporary planet Earth 🌍  We must individually receive Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord then we can escape Planet Earth 🌍:; also we can know and experience God's love and plan for our lives we must receive Christ John 3:16 / 17 for God so loved ❤the world🌏 that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life:; for God sent not his son into the world🌍 to condemn the world but through him the world🌏 might be saved.  THE SINNERS PRAYER Dear Father God, I repent of my sins. I open my heart to Jesus. I confess Jesus is my Lord God and my Saviour, I thank you for giving me eternal life. I believe that Jesus, died on the cross for me and rose from the dead. I thank you that today, you have made me your child. Amen

We all love 💖 Sunny 😎 🌞 day's 🌦️  Read it correctly of 2021 Understand 11 Angels Tasks 👼👼👼👼👼👼👼👼👼👼👼 Before the True mark of the beast 666 comes on the Earth 🌍  Revelation 14:6–12  NKJV  The Proclamations of 👼👼👼 Three Angels  6 Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth—to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people—7 saying with a loud voice, “Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; qand worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.”  8 And another angel followed, saying, “Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.”  9 Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his umark on his forehead or on his hand, 10 he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. 11 And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.”  12 Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.  Revelation 16 16 And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels 👼👼👼👼👼👼👼, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.  2 And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth;🌏 and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men and women which had the mark of the beast 666, and upon them which worshipped his image.  3 And the second angel 👼poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.  4 And the third angel 👼poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.  5 And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.  6 For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.  7 And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.  8 And the fourth angel 👼poured out his vial upon the sun 🌞; and power was given unto him to scorch men and women with fire 🔥.  9 And men and women were scorched with great heat 🔥, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.  10 And the fifth angel 👼 poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,  11 And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.  12 And the sixth angel 👼poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates;(It a Real Great River in the Middle East part of the world )  Genesis 15:18-19kjv 18 In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:  Continue reading  and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.  ( Unholy Trinity) 13 And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon 🐉 ( Satan), and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.  14 For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.  15 Behold, I come as a thief ( The LORD Jesus Christ our Savior). Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.  16 And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon. (Meggedio 50 miles north of Jerusalem Israel)  17 And the seventh angel 👼 poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.  18 And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.  19 And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.  20 And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.  21 And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent ( 💯 Pound's): and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.  My Words 😳 GOD says 7 Angels 👼👼👼👼👼👼👼 to carryout His Work! ( I lived long enough to say it's not only about the American Dream 💵💰 and surviving 365 days only 🤔 You gotta make a decision for eternity Like it or not 👍 Jesus is coming back to Claim His Planet Earth 🌎 and you want to be coming back With Him! Not Him coming to you on the Earth 🌎 with the mark of the beast 666 on you because Satan claim you his 😡👎 All can be avoided if you get Saved John 3:16/17  ◄ Genesis 8:22 ► "As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will never cease."  John 14:6 (KJV)💗 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  What is the Gospel of Jesus Christ? The word gospel means "good news" so the gospel of Christ is the good news of his coming to provide forgiveness of sins for all who will believe Romans 10:9  The Gospel of Jesus Christ is the best news anyone will ever hear and what a person does with this news will determine where he or she spends eternity God is calling you to choose  life  Romans 10:9-10kjv 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  THE SINNERS PRAYER Dear Father God, I repent of my sins. I open my heart to Jesus. I confess Jesus is my Lord God and my Saviour, I thank you for giving me eternal life. I believe that Jesus, died on the cross for me and rose from the dead. I thank you that today, you have made me your child. Amen
The Antichrist is Coming       and Also GOD'S Two Witnesses 📖    My Words 🤔 IF YOU are a Believer of Jesus Christ our LORD and Savior 💓 understand You are to be a Witness for Him 🤔 Just like He called 12 Disciples🤔 You are not of the world act like it 🤔 Our Future Brother's are our examples of our suffering now on Earth 🌎  Who are the Two Witnesses in the book of Revelation?  ANSWER  In Revelation 11:3–12 is a description of two individuals who will help accomplish God’s work during the tribulation: “I will appoint my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth” (verse 3). Nowhere does the Bible identify these two witnesses by name, although people through the years have speculated.  The two witnesses in Revelation will have miraculous powers to accompany their message (Revelation 11:6), and no one will be able to stop them in their work (verse 5). At the end of their ministry, when they have said all they need to say, The Antichrist image Called The beast 666 will kill them and the wicked world 🌍 will rejoice, allowing the bodies of the fallen prophets to lie in the streets ( No funeral ⚱️⚰️ or burial 🤔 No tears of grief and loss by the World 🌎 Understand the fake tears of Today's World 🌎 2021/22) (verses 7–10). Three and a half days later, however, God’s two witnesses will be resurrected ( Believers of Jesus Christ Death 💀💔😢 has No victory ✌️ Look beyond the Graveyards And funerals of Today) ⚱️⚰️, in full view of their enemies, ascend to heaven (verses 11–12).  There are three primary theories on the identity of the two witnesses in Revelation: (1) Moses and Elijah, (2) Enoch and Elijah, and (3) two unknown believers whom God calls to be His witnesses in the end times.  (1) Moses and Elijah are seen as possibilities for the two witnesses due to the specific miracles that John says the witnesses will perform. The witnesses will have the power to turn water into blood (Revelation 11:6), which duplicates a famous miracle of Moses (Exodus 7). And the witnesses will have the power to destroy their enemies with fire (Revelation 11:5), which corresponds to an event in Elijah’s life (2 Kings 1). Also giving strength to this view is the fact that Moses and Elijah both appeared with Jesus at the transfiguration (Matthew 17:3–4). Further, Jewish tradition expects Moses and Elijah to return, based on the prophecy of Elijah’s coming in Malachi 4:5 and God’s promise to raise up a prophet like Moses (Deuteronomy 18:15, 18), which some Jews believe necessitates Moses’ return.  (2) Enoch and Elijah are seen as possibilities for the two witnesses because of the unique circumstances surrounding their exit from the world. Enoch and Elijah, as far as we know, are the only two individuals whom God has taken directly to heaven without experiencing death (Genesis 5:23; 2 Kings 2:11). Proponents of this view point to Hebrews 9:27, which says that all men are appointed to die once. The fact that neither Enoch nor Elijah has yet experienced death seems to qualify them for the job of the two witnesses, who will be killed when their job is done. In addition, both Enoch and Elijah were prophets who pronounced God’s judgment (1 Kings 17:1; Jude 1:14–15).  My Words 🤔 We Believers need to be telling our family and friends and people around the entire world 🌍 The way out! There is no hope in this world 🌍 Satan and his Cohorts agenda And Antichrist and False Prophet leadership is gonna claim Billions and Billions of lost souls if we don't step up to the plate Rev 13:15-18 https://youtu.be/8Ke8rstdX1s  We must individually receive Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord:; then we can know and experience God's love and plan for our lives we must receive Christ John 3:16 / 17/ (Rev 6:9-11) for God so loved ❤the world🌏 that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life:; for God sent not his son into the world🌍 to condemn the world but through him the world🌏 might be saved.

IMPORTANT MESSAGE :D  the only way to Heaven 1) ADMIT THAT YOU’RE A SINNER: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God." (Romans 3:23) No one is good enough to go to Heaven on his own merit. No matter how much good we do, we still come short.  2) REALIZE THE PENALTY FOR SIN: "For the wages of sin is death..." (Romans 3:23) The penalty for our sin is eternal death in a place called Hell. But there is good news, God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus, to die on the cross for our sins, that whoever believes in Jesus should not perish but have everlasting life. ( see John 3:16) 3) BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR YOUR SINS, WAS BURIED AND THAT GOD RAISED JESUS FROM THE DEAD: 4) CALL UPON THE NAME OF JESUS: Trust in Jesus alone as your Savior. Jesus loves you and He's waiting for you with his arms wide open. Accept Jesus and repent (which means to confess and forsake your sins)
Life was so much better when this song dropped.

Manz did a whole gta robbery
John 3:16-21   For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.  For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him.  Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.  This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil.  Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed.  But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.

anyone else get vibes from “ hard to choose one “ by future ?
Money can change your life but don’t let it change your soul
Who played this joint 40 times already? 👇🏽🔥
I grew up without a Father. So many walk that same path of life, never knowing the TRUE guidance a Father can provide, the sense of protection, the unwavering love a Father is supposed to extend to his children.  It only got harder once I had children of my own, HOW do I be a Father, when I don’t even know what it means…so many abandon their children asking that same question to themselves.  God changed everything, God began showing me what it meant to love, to care, to nurture…but not just my children, but those around me “thy neighbor”.  I realized I knew no Father, just so I could come to know THE FATHER, when the time was right 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽  We are going to have “Moments of Uncertainty”  But that is not as important as the element you use to relieve yourself. Many followers of Christ are still indulging in our vices and addictions to relieve our “Uncertainties”  Lean on God in your darkest moments, lean on the word that says you were created with meaning and purpose, lean on the Grace of God…let it steady your mind, your heart and your body.  I don’t know who I’m writing to, who’s reading this, but God is ready, and waiting for you to seek him, through Jesus Christ, whom he sent to die the death meant for you and I.  Not just on Sunday, not just when you “need” him, not just when you’re desperate…but every day, hour, minute and second of your life.  Develop consistency in Christ, and you will come to know what it means to “Be still, and know, that he is God”  Glory be to God 🩸🩸🩸  If I still have you here, God bless you, join me as I take you inside a moment of my own personal “Uncertainty” in life, while never forgetting God has me always 🙏🏽🕊  https://youtu.be/VXfWQtxnwqc  🙏🏽

Dear friend, the "Good News" is the Gospel of Jesus Christ which is, "Christ died for our sins; He was buried, and He rose again the third day according to the scriptures." (1st Corinthians 15: 3-4)  The "Good News" of Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth, and the Life to salvation. Receive the truth and believe it this very moment.   Precious believer, may Father God our Creator, through Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior and the Holy Spirit bless you and keep you abundantly now and forever! Amen!! 🙏

This a whole movie NGL
👂⏰🗣️Mathew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Luke 3:7 Then he said to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by him, “Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Luke 3:8 Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to  say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. Flee eternal hell🔥, cry out to God to save you, because Jesus Christ died and is now risen at the right hand of God and he makes intercession. Only in him my Lord Jesus Christ is salvation found.  Rom10:9 👂 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.🎺🎺🎺🙏🏼🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🙏🏼. Jesus Christ is God in the flesh. Came  to destroy the works of the devil.  Plea and call out to God to save you from your sins. Please plea with him. He saved me from all my sins and forgave me. I have eternal life only because he died and now is risen at the right hand of God and he ever lives to make intercession for us.⏰🥰😊🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼⏰⏰⏰👐🕯️🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼

WOW... This guy has the worst case of TOURETTES or STUDDER that I've EVERRRRRRR seen and heard... But then again I wonder if they do this type of rap to make fun of tourettes or studders...? And ya'll pay for this? This guy obviously makes fun of studders and tourettes and gets paid MILLIONS??? I thought we as human beings were evolving and becoming more accepting and understanding to those forms of disabilities, not this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If you would like to, I'd like to share with you the story of a man that LOVES you. He was a man on the Earth, and He willingly died for our mistakes so that we can live eternally with Him. This man is Jesus Christ, and though His name is vilified by the World, He has overcome the world through His love for you.
yo NLE can you hit man he look so cool
it's giving payday 2 game and M.I.A! I love it
that's my nigga polo G going crazy🔥🔥🙌

The fact that Nle takes time out his day to like all 14K comments shows he cares about his fans💯💯
How to get tired of Choppa’s music💜🔥

This song is the definition of a masterpiece
NLE Choppa the best, I love your songs you are a capo, greetings from Colombia
Nle is goated 💯🎶🔥
🤙🏼🔥💥
Kinda boring,  most of the whole fuckin song is the hook which sounds stupid.  Its like 75% hook n 25% verse.... they are both very talented but they wasted it here. Nle rhymed the word "man" like 6 times in his short ass verse too. This could have been soooo much better if they took at least 1 hook off n added better verses. Imo this sounds like trash🗑
The makes me want to play GTA😭
🥶
🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
let's go for 2 millions
NLE X POLO is FIRE

Listened to it, and it’s fire 🔥

Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you'll hear. Everyone, including you and me, has sinned and falls short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). And because the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23) you are headed for Hell for eternity. But because God loves you, He graciously offers you the gift of Eternal Life through Jesus Christ. Jesus died for your sins on the cross. He took the punishment you deserve, and He rose again on the 3rd day. If you believe this and confess that you need Jesus as your savior, then you are saved (Romans 10:9,10),  and regardless of what you may have done, there is no condemnation for you if you are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). You are saved by what Jesus did on the cross, not what you do. Salvation is simple and free. "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."

i swear this song can be a movie and then play half of the song at the end.

HOLY BIBLE-- 3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; 4 neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. 5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. 6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. 7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!
BANGER!!!!!!
Best music video 2021 no cap
fireeeee
Polo can’t miss 🤦🏻‍♀️https://youtu.be/mSbfLNiripg

Polo G never disappoints.
Goateddddddd polo and nle best Colab everrr this track bouta be jumpin number 1😂but fr goated song 🔥
bro choppa energy is crazy this man is a legand
🔥🔥🔥🔥
BOW!
I heard it already 😮‍💨💯
NLE still got the flow🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Also what's up with all these labels under bigger labels its like the industry has made rappers disposable, I mean Grade A productions be shady almost like the knocking off talented artists to cash in on it bc the drill scene won't last forever or the mumble rap scene which the uppers know that and its sad to see with all these small record labels losing artists but is it really random? Just say in its something to think about and everyone able to form their opinion.
Fire asf nle did this
Yessir! They don’t even know what’s coming next 🤫🚀
🔥🔥🔥
NLE GOAT
GAHHH DAMN CHOPPA COMIN WITH DA HEAT🔥🔥🔥🔥
The video reminds me of a lower quality of "Bella ciao" by Hopsin I mean yeah it's a banger still though I've been tryna get into NLE Choppa but still for me the lrics aren't up there yet vs Polo G who I think is A VERY VERY UNDERATED RAPPER, same goes for like Lil Durk, and King Von, I mean shit if Von (rip his soul) still was living he was more doubt the more talented rapper... And what's going on at frade A productions anyways is it the label of disposable artists being set up by Their upper label??
NLE made sure this was going to be a banger he don’t miss 👌
this shit going crazy 🇩🇪🤝🇺🇸
Not the thumbin thing I already heard this but without polo g istg
That video was tuff
Polo G é um otario 😡
to much heat🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

NLE, I've been a fan since the -start-, but this rap style does not suit you. I feel entitled as a true fan to say that - not that you or anyone should give a fuck. But I hate seeing you go down this "dedededededede" rap path.
GOAT 🐐

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." John 3:16 God Loved us all enough to die an excruciating death on the cross and rose again on the 3rd day so that we may also have Life after Death. Through belief in his sacrifice on the cross and belief that he is our Lord and Savior, all you must do is confess with your mouth that you are sinful and in need of a savior. Please. believe in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior now, he is returning soon my Friends! Time is Short!  May God Bless and Keep you all
